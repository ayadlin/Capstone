Abstract
The incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) nearly equals its mortality rate, partly because
most PDACs are intrinsically chemoresistant and thus largely untreatable. It was found recently that
chemoresistant PDAC cells overexpress the Notch-2 receptor and have undergone epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT). In this study, we show that these two phenotypes are interrelated by expression of Midkine
(MK), a heparin-binding growth factor that is widely overexpressed in chemoresistant PDAC. Gemcitabine, the
front-line chemotherapy used in PDAC treatment, induced MK expression in a dose-dependent manner, and its
RNAi-mediated depletion was associated with sensitization to gemcitabine treatment. We identified an
interaction between the Notch-2 receptor and MK in PDAC cells. MK–Notch-2 interaction activated Notch
signaling, induced EMT, upregulated NF-kB, and increased chemoresistance. Taken together, our findings define
an important pathway of chemoresistance in PDAC and suggest novel strategies for its clinical attack. Cancer

Introduction
Insufficient diagnostic tools and therapeutic options for
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) still substantiate
its ranking as fourth leading cause of cancer-related death (1).
The combination of an unusual aggressiveness and early
metastatic locoregional as well as distant spread reflects
the urgent necessity of new therapeutic options for this deadly
disease because its incidence nearly equals mortality. This
devastating prognosis is partially because of a frequent occurrence of intrinsic or acquired chemoresistance in PDAC specimens against the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine, which is
still the standard for chemotherapeutic treatment of locally
advanced and metastatic PDAC (2).
The heparin-binding growth factor Midkine (MK) was first
identified as a retinoic acid–inducible gene during embryogenesis two decades ago (3). Since then a plethora of cellular
MK functions have been described in normal and transformed
tissue. Although MK gene expression is weak or undetectable

in adults, the MK reexpression in damaged and inflamed
tissues has been discussed (4, 5). In several malignancies,
including neuroblastomas, colorectal, and breast carcinomas,
protumorigenic effects have been linked to MK reexpression
although the mechanisms are not completely understood
(6–8).
During embryonal development, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an indispensable mechanism in which
extracellular signals convert epithelial into mesenchymal cells.
In adult organisms, EMT takes part in the pathology of certain
diseases (9). During pathologic processes such as cancer, EMT
has been shown to orchestrate a process by which epithelial
cells undergo morphologic changes, that is, a transition from
an organized cell layer and polarized organization of the
cytoskeleton, which is linked to expression of the epithelial
adhesion molecule E-cadherin, b-catenin, and g-catenin, to
mesenchymal cells without an organized cell layer showing
enhanced pseudopodia formation and subsequently more
motility and invasiveness which is linked to loss of epithelial
cell–cell junction, reorganization of cytoskeleton, and upregulation of mesenchymal markers vimentin, fibronectin, and
a-smooth-muscle-actin (a-SMA; ref. 10–12). EMT is triggered
by a tightly regulated interplay of extracellular signals such as
soluble growth factors like epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor b (13, 14). Numerous receptors such as
Notch have been identified playing a significant role in the
acquisition of EMT in cancer (15). The activation of Notch
regulates expression of target genes playing important roles in
embryonic development, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.
Recently, the activated Notch receptor-2 (Notch-2) was
shown to mediate an EMT phenotype in PDAC cells whereas

shown to be linked to acquired chemoresistance in colon
cancer cells (16). Moreover, Notch-2 was recently shown to
interact with MK to regulate cell plasticity and motility in
human keratinocytes (17).

human total pancreas RNA (Stratagene and Ambion) serving
as healthy controls on GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus
2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix). Analyses were carried out according to
the 1-cycle cDNA synthesis protocol for GeneChip ExpressionAnalysis (Affymetrix) and achieved data were analyzed using
GCOS 1.4.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Tumor tissues for establishment of primary chemoresistant
PDAC cell lines (PaCa 5061, 5072, and 5156) were taken from
patients who underwent total pancreaticoduodenectomy for
advanced PDAC in the Surgery, University Medical Center
Hamburg (2009). Written informed consent of patients was
obtained prior to surgery. The procedure of cell line establishment from tumor tissue was previously published (18). Primary cells were cultured in TUM medium. L3.6pl (19), BxPC-3,
and PANC-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's
medium or RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum and 200 IU/mL Pen-Strep at 37 C and 5% CO2.
For development of gemcitabine-resistant L3.6pl cells (L3.6plRes), cells were exposed to an initial gemcitabine concentration of 0.05 mmol/L. The surviving population was grown to
80% confluence and passaged 3 times over 14 days to ensure
stable viability. Cells were then treated with sequentially
increased gemcitabine concentrations (0.1 mmol/L, 0.3
mmol/L, 0.5 mmol/L, 1 mmol/L; 21 days each) up to the
clinically relevant concentration of 2 mmol/L for 30 days.
L3.6pl-Res cells are approximately 20 times more resistant
to gemcitabine than L3.6pl cells. All used cell lines were
genotyped by DNA fingerprinting (Identifiler-Kit; Applied
Biosystems).
Reagents
Gemcitabine was purchased from Eli Lilly and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) from Sigma. Recombinant human MK (rh-MK) was
purchased from R&D Systems and used at concentrations of
20 and 50 ng/mL, respectively. In rh-MK experiments, cells
were deprived of serum for 14 hours and treated for 24 hours
with 20 or 50 ng/mL.
Notch-2 signaling
PaCa 5061 and PANC-1 cells (105) were cultured in 6-well
plates. Then, cells were cultured in serum-free media for approximately 14 hours. Subsequently, cells were treated for 24 hours
with 20 and 50 ng/mL of rh-MK or left untreated and served as
control. rh-MK–induced Notch-2 cleavage was detected by using
antibodies recognizing the intracellular domain (Notch-2ICD).
Functional receptor activation was detected by using antibodies
against the downstream target genes Hes-1 and NF-kB/RelA.
RNA isolation and expression analyses
Total RNA were isolated by using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The
dried pellet was cleaned with the RNeasy MiniElute Kit
(Qiagen). RNA concentration was measured on a NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer (Peqlab). Gene expression profiles of
whole human genome were generated by hybridizing either
5 mg of total RNA from PaCa 5061, 5072, and 5156 or 5 mg

Cell viability analyses
To determine drug sensitivity, cells were incubated with
different concentrations of gemcitabine and 5-FU. Cell proliferation was determined with CellTiter 96 AQueous Cell
Proliferation Assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Values for control cells were considered as
100% viability.
Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted to quantify gene expression or to verify RNAi-mediated
downregulation. Total RNA (1 mg) was reverse transcribed by
using the Transcriptor cDNA Kit (Roche). PCRs were carried
out in a Mastercycler ep-realplex (Eppendorf). Data were
analyzed according to the comparative CT method and normalized for cyclophilin expression in each sample.
Plasmids
Cells were transfected with siRNAs against MK and Notch-2
or control siRNA (Santa Cruz) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Notch-2 open reading frame encoding the N-terminal
extracellular domain (1–351) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into p3xFLAG-CMV-14. MK was amplified by PCR and
subcloned for expression into pCS2 (20).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
PANC-1 cells were transfected with indicated plasmids.
Following transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma)
containing 1 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation (IP) as previously described (20).
Western blots, IPs, and immunostainings were carried out by
using antibodies listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Immunohistochemistry
Stainings were carried out with peroxidase method according to manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems). Paraffinembedded human PDAC specimens were obtained from the
Tissue-Bank of the University of Hamburg. PDAC slides (5 mm)
were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol.
Antigen retrieval was done by microwave heating. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by H2O2 [1% (v/v) in
methanol]. Sections were counterstained with Meyer's hemalaun-solution (Merck) and permanently mounted. For negative control stainings, normal tissue was stained or
appropriate control IgG stainings were carried out.
Data analyses
Expression analyses and achieved data were analyzed by
using GCOS 1.4 and scaled to a default target signal value of
150. Absolute and comparative analyses were conducted by

Midkine Expression Is Linked to EMT and Chemoresistance

top 5 hits, we identified MK as overexpressed in cell lines
(Fig. 1A, left). The P values and fold changes of selected genes
are shown in Table 1 (Supplementary Table S1). To further
validate our microarray results, we retested MK overexpression and carried out real-time RT-PCR to quantify MK mRNA
in the investigated lines (Fig. 1A, right). We expanded these
analyses and quantified MK mRNA expression in more than 30
additional PDAC tissues by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). We
observed a statistically significant mRNA overexpression in
more than 50% of the investigated samples (P < 0.05). To verify
that the MK mRNA expression resulted in robust protein
expression, we carried out immunostainings from same tissues or investigated MK protein expression in cell lines and
showed that mRNA overexpression resulted in robust protein
expression. Consistent with previous observations where MK
mRNA was shown to be overexpressed in PDAC (21), we
further showed that the mRNA overexpression resulted in
robust protein expression (Fig. 1C). Moreover, steady-state
MK protein levels were upregulated in chemoresistant PDAC
lines and almost undetectable in sensitive cells (Fig. 1D).

Results
MK is frequently overexpressed in chemoresistant
PDAC
The PDAC cell line PaCa 5061 has recently been characterized in depth in vitro and in vivo (18). To identify novel players
involved in intrinsic or acquired chemoresistance in PDAC, we
analyzed the gene expression profile of 3 newly established
chemoresistant cell lines (PaCa 5061, 5072, and 5156) in
comparison with RNA expression patterns obtained from 2
independent normal pancreas specimens. The native intrinsic
gemcitabine resistance was examined in all lines prior to the
analysis. To identify chemoresistance-relevant molecules, we
searched for "hits" overrepresented more than 5-fold in all
resistant lines compared with normal pancreas. Among the

Gemcitabine-induced MK expression is dose dependent
Because all investigated cell lines are highly resistant to
gemcitabine, we hypothesized that the MK overexpression
may play a role in chemoresistance. To test this, we treated
chemosensitive and chemoresistant lines with gemcitabine.
Interestingly, we found that MK protein levels were increased
in a dose-dependent manner in chemoresistant cells (Fig. 2A,
top). In contrast, treatment of chemosensitive cells failed to
increase MK protein levels (Fig. 2A, bottom). Moreover, MK
protein levels were only barely detectable in control-treated as
well as gemcitabine-treated chemosensitive cells. Because it is
known that the MK signaling is post-translationally extinguished by proteasome-dependent degradation (22), we examined whether gemcitabine-induced MK upregulation occurs at
the mRNA level. Indeed, we found that MK mRNA expression
is dose-dependently induced by gemcitabine in chemoresistant PDAC cells (Fig. 2B, top). In contrast, MK mRNA levels in
gemcitabine-treated chemosensitive cells remained either
slightly decreased or unchanged (Fig. 2B, bottom). Moreover,
we investigated whether other chemotherapeutics used in
PDAC treatment may also increase MK expression. As
expected, treatment of chemoresistant cells with 5-FU
resulted in dose-dependent MK upregulation, whereas no
induction was again observed in chemosensitive cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Because MK is a secreted growth factor
involved in paracrine/autocrine regulation of growth and
differentiation, we investigated whether the MK secretion is
increased in chemoresistant cells upon gemcitabine treatment. Indeed, we found robust and dose-dependently released
MK protein levels in gemcitabine-treated cells (Fig. 2C, top),
whereas no increased MK secretion was detectable in chemosensitive cells (Fig. 2C, bottom).
RNAi-mediated abrogation of MK induction by
chemotherapy restores chemosensitivity
Because MK is induced at the mRNA and protein level in
gemcitabine-treated chemoresistant cells, we hypothesized
that MK mediates intrinsic chemoresistance. First, we examined whether RNAi-mediated MK downregulation can restore
chemosensitivity in PDAC cells. Transient transfections of
PANC-1 and PaCa 5061 with 2 different MK siRNAs decreased
efficiently MK expression (Fig. 3A and B, right). We then
analyzed the consequences of depleted MK during chemotherapy and carried out cell viability assays. Strikingly, we
observed that MK depletion can effectively restore chemosensitivity in chemoresistant cells (Fig. 3A and B, left). Moreover, we carried out rescue experiments via exogenous
treatment of MK-depleted PaCa 5061 and PANC-1 cells with
rh-MK. Here, we observed substantially increased chemoresistance in rh-MK–treated MK-depleted cells, compared with
untreated cells and chemoresistance reached almost similar
levels as control-transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). As
we found the MK secretion to be induced by gemcitabine, we
examined whether BxPC-3 and L3.6pl cells may acquire a
chemoresistance phenotype through exogenous treatment of
rh-MK. Serum-deprived cells were pretreated with rh-MK
followed by treatment with increasing gemcitabine concentrations and then transferred to viability assays. Interestingly,

5012

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

pretreatment of L3.6pl cells with rh-MK resulted in substantially increased viability compared with untreated cells
(Fig. 3C, left) whereas chemosensitivity of BxPC-3 cells was
unaltered (Fig. 3C, right).
MK overexpression contributes to EMT in pancreatic
cancer
To identify molecular alterations that mediate chemoresistance and to investigate whether the MK expression is
involved in this mechanism, we obtained a chemoresistant
subclone from chemosensitive L3.6pl cells, hereafter designated as L3.6pl-Res, through sequential treatment with
increasing gemcitabine concentrations over time. In viability
assays, L3.6pl-Res cells showed a substantial enhancement of
chemoresistance toward gemcitabine. However, during the
establishment of L3.6pl-Res cells, we observed morphologic
changes toward spindle-shaped morphology and enhanced
pseudopodia formation (Fig. 4A, right), whereas L3.6pl cells
displayed a cobblestone epithelial morphology (Fig. 4A, left).
As previously reported (23), the observed phenotypic changes
suggested that L3.6pl-Res cells had undergone EMT over time.
To further confirm these observations, we analyzed in more
detail by Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR, whether the
acquisition of gemcitabine resistance induced molecular
changes consistent with EMT. As a hallmark of epithelial
cells, we found elevated expression of the epithelial adhesion
molecule E-cadherin in L3.6pl cells. In addition, b-catenin and
g-catenin protein levels were prominently expressed, suggesting that L3.6pl cells display an epithelial phenotype. In contrast, analysis of L3.6pl-Res cells revealed increased expression
of mesenchymal markers vimentin, fibronectin, and a-SMA
(Fig. 4B). Moreover, expression of the EMT-related transcription factors Snail and NF-kB was markedly increased. Because
Notch-2 is upregulated in gemcitabine-resistant cells (15), we
also analyzed its expression and found substantially increased
Notch-2 protein levels in L3.6pl-Res cells, suggesting that its
expression is not only important for gemcitabine-induced
EMT but also for acquired chemoresistance in PDAC. Analysis
of L3.6pl-Res cells for other Notch family members did not
reveal any and found no increased expression except for
Notch-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Interestingly, gemcitabine
treatment of chemosensitive BxPC-3 cells failed to induce
Notch-2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S4). We then investigated whether MK is reexpressed in L3.6pl-Res cells and
found tremendous MK mRNA as well as protein levels compared with L3.6pl cells (Fig. 4B and C). To pinpoint whether
these molecular changes were due to changes in gene expression, we quantified the expression of E-cadherin, vimentin,
Notch-2, and MK by using real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4C).
E-cadherin was greatly decreased whereas vimentin, MK,
and Notch-2 expression was highly increased in L3.6pl-Res
cells. Interestingly, these results were independently confirmed by the expression data obtained for 3 chemoresistant
PDAC cell lines (data not shown).
In proof-of-concept experiments, we depleted MK expression in L3.6pl-Res cells by using 2 different siRNAs and treated
cells with increasing gemcitabine concentrations followed
by viability assays. MK-depleted L3.6pl-Res cells showed

different MK siRNAs or nonspecific si-control. Then, cells were treated with increasing gemcitabine concentrations for an additional 24 hours, and viability
was measured by MTT assay. Left, RNAi-mediated MK depletion is linked to increased chemosensitivity compared with si-control. Right, RNAi-mediated

then cell viability was measured.

rh-MK–treated MK-depleted cells, compared with untreated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our results suggest that gemcitabine-induced EMT accompanied by acquired chemoresistance is feasible in a subset of PDAC cells and involves the
reexpression of MK and increased Notch-2 expression.
MK depletion induces reversal of EMT to MET in
L3.6pl-Res cells
Because several growth factors have been shown to trigger
EMT, we hypothesized that MK may play a role in the
acquisition of EMT in PDAC. To confirm this, we decreased
MK expression in L3.6pl-Res cells with siRNA and investigated
mRNA and protein expression with respect to EMT markers. It
was previously shown that depletion of Notch-2 in EMTacquired cells induced the reversal to MET (15). We, therefore,
decreased Notch-2 expression in L3.6pl-Res cells by using
siRNA. As shown in Fig. 5, the applied MK and Notch-2 siRNAs
were highly effective which resulted in decreased protein
expression compared with si-control (Fig. 5A and B). Subsequently, we verified by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting
whether EMT was reversed to MET in MK and/or Notch-2–
depleted L3.6pl-Res cells. Indeed, E-cadherin mRNA expres-

sion was significantly increased in either MK or Notch-2
siRNA-transfected L3.6pl-Res cells compared with si-control
(Fig. 5C). To further confirm that si-MK and/or si-Notch-2–
transfected cells are able to induce MET, we analyzed vimentin expression and found significantly decreased mRNA levels
(Fig. 5C). Along with the mRNA expression, we found elevated
E-cadherin and dramatically decreased vimentin protein
expression in siRNA-transfected L3.6pl-Res cells, which is
consistent with the reversed transition from EMT to MET
(Fig. 5A). To validate whether Notch downstream signaling is
affected in Notch-2–depleted cells, we analyzed the protein
expression of NF-kB/RelA. On the basis of previously published observations (24), we found substantially decreased NFkB protein expression in si-Notch-2–transfected cells, suggesting that Notch downstream signaling is affected (Fig. 5A).
Interestingly, we found decreased NF-kB protein expression in
si-MK–transfected L3.6pl-Res cells, suggesting that MK crosstalks with Notch to positively regulate Notch downstream
signaling (Fig. 5A). It is well known that an increased migration/invasion potential is a hallmark of mesenchymal cells.
Therefore, we carried out migration/invasion assay by using
MK-depleted PaCa 5061, 5072, 5156, and L3.6pl-Res cells or

MK-depleted chemoresistant PDAC cells migrated and
invaded significantly less than control-transfected cells
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S5).
MK mediates chemoresistance through binding and
activation of Notch-2
Because MK and Notch-2 expression is dramatically
increased in chemoresistant PDAC cells and both are linked
to EMT, we hypothesized that MK may trigger Notch signaling
and subsequently the activation of antiapoptotic pathways
such as NF-kB signaling to promote chemoresistance in
PDAC. We first analyzed a possible interaction between MK
and the extracellular domain of Notch-2 by subcloning
coding region for MK into pCS2 (pCS2-MK) and extracellular
domain (residues 1–351) of Notch-2 (Notch-2-exD1–351) into
p3xFLAG-CMV-14 resulting in expression of Flag-tagged
Notch-2-exD1–351. The Flag-Notch-2-exD1–351 expression

construct was transiently cotransfected along with pCS2-MK
into PANC-1 cells, and protein complexes were precipitated
with antibodies against MK followed by immunoblotting for
detection of Flag-tagged Notch-2-exD1–351 and vice versa.
Appropriate control transfections were carried out by cotransfections of pCS2-MK along with p3xFLAG-CMV-14. Strikingly,
we found robust interaction of MK and Notch-2-exD1–351 in
PANC-1 cells, whereas MK failed to interact with Flag alone
(Fig. 6A, left). The same experiment was done vice versa and
revealed positive interaction between MK and Notch-2-exD1–
351
(Fig. 6A, right). To investigate whether the MK–Notch-2
interaction is functional with respect to Notch-2 activation
which is followed by the g-secretase–mediated cleavage of
Notch-2ICD, we treated chemoresistant cells with rh-MK and
analyzed cells for the presence of Notch-2ICD with specific
antibodies. Treatment of chemoresistant cells with rh-MK
resulted in an intensified cleavage of Notch-2ICD compared
with untreated (control) cells, whereas full-length Notch-2

protein was slightly decreased (Fig. 6B). We found that rh-MK–
mediated cleavage of Notch-2ICD was dose independent and
efficiently induced Notch-2 intracellular cleavage in the same
manner. We then examined whether the rh-MK–mediated
increase of Notch-2ICD could force up NF-kB protein expression which is known to be the central regulator of antiapoptotic
pathways, and found elevated NF-kB protein levels in Notch-2–
activated cells. To further validate MK-mediated Notch-2
cleavage and activation, we analyzed protein expression of
the well-known Notch target in mammals, Hes-1, and found
elevated protein levels in rh-MK–treated cells (Fig. 6B).
Because it was recently shown that elevated Notch-1
expression is linked to increased resistance against oxaliplatin
in colorectal cancer (16), we analyzed whether RNAi-mediated
Notch-2 depletion would affect chemoresistance in PDAC. We
transiently transfected PaCa 5061 and PANC-1 cells with
either si-control or si-Notch-2 and treated cells with gemcitabine (5 mmol/L) or left them untreated (Mock) followed by
viability assays. The combination of si-Notch-2 and gemcitabine decreased cell viability of both resistant lines compared
with si-control–transfected cells (Fig. 6C; P < 0.05).

and render the majority of cases nonresectable (25). Also,
completely resected patients develop recurrent disease and
eventually require palliative treatment. The majority of
patients receive little or no benefit from adjuvant therapies
mainly because most of the cancer cells have been shown to
be either intrinsically chemoresistant or become chemoresistant during therapy.
In this study, we addressed the evident need of identifying
novel players and sought to further comprehend their molecular role for chemoresistance in PDAC. It was recently shown
that MK secretion has cytoprotective functions in hepatocytes
against cellular damage when exposed to heavy metals or
when the MK protein was applied to the location of ischemia
injury in the heart (26, 27). The external stimuli and intracellular signaling that may promote MK expression are unknown.
Several receptors have been proposed to turn activated upon
MK binding in embryonic tissue as well as in cancer. MK was
shown to bind low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein, a4b1-integrin, and a6b1-integrin in embryonic neuronal
tissue which mediated intracellular phosphorylation of Src
family proteins (28, 29). For promotion of migration and
invasion of human head and neck cancer cells, it was proposed
that MK binds to tetraspanin, which then induces tyrosine
phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase followed by activation of the STAT1a pathway (30). In this study, we have found
a robust interaction of MK and Notch-2 in vitro. The treatment

of Notch-2–positive PDAC cells with soluble MK resulted in
Notch-2 activation and was linked to upregulation of Notch
downstream targets, Hes-1 and NF-kB/RelA, suggesting that
the MK–Notch-2 interaction positively regulates Notch downstream signaling. Notch-2 and Notch-4 expression were
recently described to be upregulated in chemoresistant PDAC
which is linked to acquired EMT (15). Our data confirmed this
in the case of Notch-2 but not for Notch-4. Although all Notch
receptors are more or less expressed in the investigated cells,
we observed a specific Notch-2 upregulation suggesting a sine
qua non in triggering and maintaining the EMT phenotype
which is accompanied by increased chemoresistance. In
proof-of-concept studies, we found substantially increased
chemosensitivity in Notch-2–depleted cells, suggesting that
Notch signaling not only contributed to proliferation and
differentiation but also to the regulation of cell death through
cross-talking with NF-kB signaling. Our observations are,
therefore, in agreement with previous studies showing Notch
signaling to positively influence NF-kB signaling through the
transcriptional regulation of positive regulators of the pathway in T-cell leukemia (31). In this context, it was shown that
NF-kB is not only frequently constitutive active in PDAC but

www.aacrjournals.org

also represses E-cadherin expression in mammary epithelial
cells and, thus, supporting EMT (32, 33).
According to recent publications, the natural Notch ligand
Jagged-1 is upregulated in chemoresistant PDAC (15) and
chemoresistant colorectal cancer (16). Obviously, downregulation of Jagged-1 expression in colorectal cancer revealed no
functional relevance for chemoresistance (16). Interestingly,
we also observed that Jagged-1 depletion in PDAC cells had no
impact on chemoresistance (data not shown) suggesting that
binding or recruitment of other molecules are of pivotal
importance for mediating acquired chemoresistance in PDAC.
It is well known that the phenotype of chemoresistant- and
EMT-acquired PDAC cells is associated with changes in their
morphology. Through serial gemcitabine exposure of L3.6pl
cells, we also observed morphologic changes that were associated with decreased expression of epithelial markers and an
increase of mesenchymal markers suggesting that L3.6pl cells
were capable of inducing an EMT phenotype over time.
Moreover, we found reexpression of MK and increased
Notch-2 expression in EMT-acquired L3.6pl-Res cells.
Attempts to establish a drug-resistant cell clone from
BxPC-3 cells were unsuccessful. This phenomenon was also

mirrored by the observation that exogenous treatment of
L3.6pl cells with rh-MK resulted in substantially increased
chemoresistance whereas chemosensitivity of BxPC-3 was
unaltered. Therefore, we hypothesized that cells lacking corresponding signaling cascades or a specific set of molecules
are not capable of undergoing EMT accompanied by increased
chemoresistance in PDAC. Interestingly, it was already shown
that MK and Notch-2 are independently involved in EMT
processes. During early organogenesis in mice, the MK expression was shown to be associated with epithelial–mesenchymal
interactions. The authors observed that the MK gene was
highly expressed in mesenchyme whereas the protein was
distributed to the surface of epithelial cells which expressed
nondetectable mRNA amounts during several stages of tooth
development in mice suggesting that MK may act by a
paracrine mechanism (34). Strikingly, it was shown that
Notch-2 expression is also regulated by epithelial–mesenchymal interactions in the developing mouse tooth and is
reexpressed in adults under pathologic conditions suggesting
that Notch-2 is involved in cellular repair processes during
vertebrate development (35).
Our data are also in full agreement with previous observations in which MK was identified as being overexpressed in
chemoresistant gastric cancer cells (36). Factors that may
potentiate transcription or reexpression of MK are still
unknown. Further, one could speculate that increased MK
secretion may also trigger intercellular chemoresistance by
activating Notch signaling in surrounding neighboring cells
in order to activate defense mechanisms against drug toxicity.
It is probable that our results may also explain previous

observations in which the treatment of chemosensitive cells
with conditioned cell culture media from MK-overexpressed
cells was linked to increased Akt phosphorylation and, thus,
increased cell viability (37).
In conclusion, our study revealed the identification of a
novel mediator of EMT and drug resistance in PDAC cells. To
further corroborate our findings in vivo, knowledge transfer to
mouse models is of pivotal importance. It should, further, be
determined whether these findings are applicable to other
cells capable of developing resistance toward other chemotherapeutics. Therefore, targeting MK or blocking/reversing EMT prior to or during chemotherapy may force
chemoresistant cells to revert to sensitive cells and, thus,
may eventually be of tremendous benefit for patients suffering
from advanced chemoresistant cancers, as it is unfortunately
still the reality for PDAC.
