BACKGROUND: Little information exists regarding the prevalence and natural history of pericardial disease in
patients with leukemia. Recently, it has been reported that the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors is associated
with an increased incidence of pericardial effusions (PEs). To study the characteristics and treatment relationships of
PEs in patients with leukemia, the authors retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with leukemia evaluated at a
single center. METHODS: The authors reviewed 2592 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n ¼ 1282, 49%),
acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n ¼ 336, 13%), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n ¼ 974, 38%), who were evaluated from August 2003 to July 2008. Electronic medical records were reviewed to select patients who had undergone at least 1 echocardiographic evaluation. Data regarding diagnosis, timing, effusion size, survival, and prior
therapy were collected for the patients who had echocardiographic evidence of PEs. RESULTS: PEs were detected in
325 (20%) of the patients who had echocardiograms: 21% in AML, 23% in ALL, and 18% in MDS patients. Only a small
portion of PEs were detected before the initiation of therapy: 26% in AML, 25% ALL, and 15% in MDS patients. Most
PEs were of minimal size (70%) overall. No significant differences in effusion characteristics, including severity, were
observed among different types of therapies. The presence of PEs had no impact on the survival of the patients
evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: PEs are relatively common in patients with leukemia and do not appear to be related to

Leukemia is a systemic disorder that can frequently involve the hepatic, renal, circulatory, and cardiopulmonary systems.1 However, little is known about pericardial disease in patients with leukemia.
Pericardial effusions (PEs) have been reported to be rare at initial diagnosis in leukemia.2 However, PEs have long
been viewed as part of the leukemic disease process, arising secondary to hemorrhagic, infectious, or leukemic infiltrates.3
PEs have also been thought to be associated with certain forms of chemotherapy including bleomycin, all-trans-retinoic
acid, and cyclophosphamide.4 PEs are a potentially life-threatening condition, especially if cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis develops. Echocardiography is the safest and most commonly used modality for diagnosing PEs.5
Our interest in PEs developed as the result of a report of an increased incidence of PEs in patients treated with the
histone deacetylase inhibitor MGCD0103 (unpublished data). MGCD0103 is a novel small molecule that is being studied as a single agent or in combination chemotherapy regimens for solid tumors,6 lymphoma,7 and leukemia.8 This report
of increased PEs was performed by the sponsor of a clinical trial of MGCD0103 in combination with 5-azacytidine
(Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ) that resulted in early termination of this study.
Although QT interval prolongation has been reported with the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors, no other significant cardiac toxicities have been reported.9 Therefore, the identification of a new class-specific toxicity could have significant implications for the further development of these agents. This led to the need for the current study of PEs in
leukemia.

In the present study, we sought to determine the
rate, severity, and timing of PEs in leukemia. Furthermore, we sought to investigate if any specific class of chemotherapeutic agents, including histone deacetylase
inhibitors, were associated with more severe PEs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the electronic medical records of 2592
patients evaluated in the Leukemia Department at The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) between August 2003 and July 2008 following institutional guidelines. These patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n ¼ 1282,
49%), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n ¼ 336, 13%),
or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n ¼ 974, 38%). Of
the initial cohort, 1600 patients (62%) had at least 1 echocardiogram performed at some point during their treatment course.
The electronic medical record for each patient with
a PE was reviewed for all treatment history, leukemia
characteristics, survival, PE size, and evolution of the PEs.
A numerical score was assigned to grade the size of the PE
based on the echocardiogram report: minimal (1), small
(2), moderate (3), large (4), and not classifiable (0). Five
(1.5%) patients had complete records, but the PE size was
indeterminate and could not be classified (grade 0). For
patients with multiple echocardiograms, data at the time
of the first echocardiogram revealing a PE was used in our
analysis. Subsequent echocardiograms were also reviewed
to follow the evolution of PEs sequentially. Specifically,
we collected data from the next echocardiogram after the
initial PE was detected and also the last echocardiogram
available for the patient. Only those patients with followup echocardiograms were included in this analysis. The
determination of other concomitant systemic effusions
such as pleural effusions and ascites was made by imaging
studies such as a chest radiograph, computed tomography
scan, or an abdominal ultrasound.

Survival was calculated from the initial presentation
at MDACC. Survival duration was plotted according to
the Kaplan and Meier method.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 2592 patients charts were reviewed, with 1600
patients (62%) having an echocardiogram at some point
during the treatment course. Patient characteristics are
shown in Table 1. Patients who had an echocardiogram
were significantly younger than those who did not
(Table 1).
Frequency and Size of PEs in Leukemia
Overall, a PE was detected in 325 (20%) patients of the
1600 patients evaluated: 21% in AML (n ¼ 185), 23% in
ALL (n ¼ 68), and 18% in MDS (n ¼ 72) patients (P ¼
.27). In the 325 patients with evidence of PEs, most effusions occurred after receiving some form of therapy: 74%
in AML (n ¼ 136), 75% in ALL (n ¼ 51), and 85% in
MDS (n ¼ 61) patients (P ¼ .20). The remainder of PEs
were present before therapy or at initial presentation (Fig.
1). The distribution of PEs before therapy accounted for
26% in AML (n ¼ 49), 25% in ALL (n ¼ 17), and 15%
in MDS (n ¼ 11) patients (P ¼ .20).
The majority of the PEs in leukemia were of minimal or trace size (grade 1, 70%). There was a similar overall distribution of PE sizes or grades in all 3 leukemias (P
¼ .85; Fig. 2A). The size of PEs was not significantly different for the 3 leukemias before therapy or after therapy
(P ¼ .77, pretreatment and P ¼ .75, post-treatment; Fig.
2B and C). Less than 9% of PEs in ALL, AML, or MDS
were considered to be moderate or large in size (grade 3 or
4) at any time point. The initial PE detected was on average the largest (Fig. 3). The follow-up echocardiogram
revealed a decrease in size across all disease categories. In
patients with >1 follow-up echocardiogram, the last echo
revealed a slight decrease in PE size, except in MDS.

lymphocytic leukemia; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; MDS,

Effect of Therapy on PE Development
We subsequently studied the frequency and size of PEs in
relation to a specific class or type of treatment. Those
patients who had received no prior therapy with the same
diagnosis were used as controls. We compared the distribution of the size of PEs in patients who had a prior exposure to a particular class of chemotherapeutic agents to the
control group.
No single type of therapy, including histone deacetylase inhibitor, was found to correlate with larger PEs
with any statistical significance (Table 2). The distribution of PEs in the group of patients treated with histone
deacetylase inhibitor does not suggest more severe effusions in this group compared with the others.
Relationship With Ascites or Pleural Effusions
Of the 325 of patients with PEs, most were often found to
have evidence of other systemic effusions. Approximately
23% of patients (n ¼ 75) were found to have ascites at the
time of a PE based on abdominal imaging studies.
Approximately 75% of patients (n ¼ 244) had a pleural
effusion based on chest imaging studies. Concurrent ascites, pleural effusion, and a PE were found in 23% of the
patients (n ¼ 75).
Clinical Management of PEs
Only 10 (3%) patients required pericardiocentesis due to
tamponade at the time of the initial PE. Most of the PEs

were either asymptomatic or did not require direct intervention. Of interest, analysis of the pericardial fluid
revealed that 4 (40%) patients had leukemic blasts present. Analysis of the other PEs revealed hemorrhagic infiltrates or serosanguineous fluid.
Impact on Survival
We also studied the impact of having a PE on survival.
Patients with or without a PE had a median survival of 60
weeks (P ¼ .63, Fig. 4A). Patients who had an echocardiogram had a median survival of 60 weeks versus 53 weeks
for those without an echocardiogram (P ¼ .38, Fig. 4B).

DISCUSSION
Leukemias are systemic disorders that can clinically effect
any organ system. Organ dysfunction is not uncommon,
particularly at the initial presentation of patients with acute
leukemias. Renal, hepatic, and cardiopulmonary impairment and infections frequently preclude initiation of
optimal chemotherapy in a significant portion of patients.
Although cardiopulmonary complications including
pericardial effusions are observed in the course of treating
patients with leukemia, little is known specifically about
the frequency and severity and clinical implications of PEs
in leukemia. Interest in this issue developed from the
recent report of an increased incidence of PEs in patients
treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor
MGCD0103. This observation has lead to the halting of
all clinical trials using this compound until further

evaluation is completed as determined by the sponsors
(Celgene and MethylGene, Montreal, Canada) and the
US Food and Drug Administration. Because of the potential importance and promise of histone deacetylase inhibitor in the treatment of leukemias, we were compelled to
examine the incidence, therapeutic relationships, and clinical significance of PEs in leukemia.
To study PEs in leukemia, we identified 2592
patients with ALL, AML, or MDS seen at MDACC from
2003 to 2008 (Table 1). Patients who had echocardiograms versus those who did not were similar in characteristics, except for younger average age. The difference in
age is likely related to the more frequent use of anthracycline-based therapy during induction therapy in younger
patients (<60 years). The incidence of a PE was similar
between ALL, AML, and MDS (15%-27%) at initial presentation and before any leukemia treatments (Fig. 1).
The majority of PEs in all 3 diseases occurred after systemic treatment had been initiated.
Overall, most of the PEs (70%) were clinically insignificant and were considered to be trivial or minimal by

2370

echocardiographic measurements. Only a small portion of
PEs (ranging from 5% to 7%) were considered moderate
or large (Fig. 2A). The sizes of PEs were similar whether
discovered before therapy or after (Fig. 2B and C). We
also studied the evolution of PE size over time. This analysis indicated that the largest PE was the initial effusion
detected. Overall, PEs decreased in size with time and
continued therapy, but rarely resolved completely (Fig. 3).
Since PEs were clearly more frequent in patients
receiving therapy, we studied relationships between PE
severity and chemotherapeutic classes. Table 2 shows how
frequently moderate-sized or larger PEs (grades > ¼ 2 or
> ¼ 3) were associated with exposure to drugs from various chemotherapeutic classes. No single class appears to
be significantly linked with larger PEs.
We also sought to determine the clinical significance
of having an echocardiogram or a PE in leukemia patients.
Survival does not appear to be different between those
patients with a PE and those without (Fig. 4A). Similarly,
survival is not significantly different for patients who had
an echocardiogram versus those who did not (Fig. 4B).
This suggests that PEs have very little effect on the outcome
in patients with leukemia. The increased frequency of PEs
during therapy is likely clinically insignificant as well.
There are several limitations to our analysis. Most
are related to the retrospective nature of this study and
the heterogeneity of the patient characteristics and the
types of therapies used. The first question relates to why
only a portion of patients had an echocardiogram (Fig.
1). Most likely this is a result of inclusion in clinical trials
or the use of known cardiotoxic therapies such as anthracyclines. This also explains the younger age of the
patients undergoing an echocardiogram. Patients who
did have an echocardiogram were on average 9 years
younger than those who did not. When gathering data
on the evolution of PEs, we are limited by the number of
follow-up studies. Many patients had multiple follow-up
echocardiograms, whereas others did not have any. This
poses a problem, because the lack of follow-up studies
could be due to a variety of reasons including an improving clinical picture or death.
Another major limitation is that we cannot provide
data in most cases of the specific type of the PEs. Only 3%
of the patients with PEs had a pericardiocentesis. However, most patients with PEs also had other systemic effusions. Twenty-four percent had evidence of ascites on
abdominal imaging, and 77% had evidence of pleural
effusions on chest imaging studies. This supports the idea
that PEs are related to a systemic process, either

inflammatory, infectious, or from the leukemia itself.
This would also strengthen the notion that PEs are by and
large part of the natural history of the disease. Finally,
although having an echocardiogram was not associated
with distinct prognosis, this should not be used as a reason
not to perform echocardiographic evaluation in patients
receiving therapy for leukemia.
In summary, most PEs occur in leukemia patients
after some therapy. However, no chemotherapeutic class
appears to be directly related to causing more severe PEs.
Most PEs are insignificant in size and appear to have little
effect on survival in patients with leukemia.
