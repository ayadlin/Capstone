ABSTRACT:
E2F-1, a key transcription factor necessary for cell growth, DNA repair and
differentiation, is an attractive target for development of useful anticancer drugs
in tumors that are E2F “oncogene addicted”. A peptide, isolated from phage clones,
based on its binding to an E2F-1 consensus sequence, was cytotoxic against a wide
range of cancer cell lines.
The peptide was coupled to penetratin (PEP) and tested against prostate cancer
cell lines. As the PEP was found to be relatively unstable in serum, it was encapsulated
in PEGylated liposomes for in vivo studies.
The peptide was cytotoxic against prostate cell lines at low micromolar
concentrations. Treatment of mice bearing the human Du-145 human prostate tumor
with the PEP encapsulated in PEGylated liposomes (PL-PEP) caused tumor regression
without significant toxicity.
The liposome encapsulated PEP has promise as an antitumor agent, alone or in
combination with inhibitors of DNA synthesis.

INTRODUCTION

development, proliferation, DNA repair, and
differentiation [2-6]. The retinoblastoma gene product
(RB) is a critical player in the regulation of E2F. RB forms
heterodimers with E2F-1, 2 and 3a, thereby suppresses
E2F activity [7-9]. RB is phosphorylated by CDK 4, 6
and 2 in respnse to signals favoring cell cycle progression,
and as a consequence, E2F is freed from this repressor
complex, and transcribes many target genes. E2F-1 and
E2F-3 are over expressed in many tumors and is associated
with poor prognosis [10,11]. Therefore, targeting one or
more activating E2Fs, has been recognized as an important
and selective antitumor strategy. Several approaches have
been described, that include oligonucleotide decoys to
trap E2F-1, and generation of peptides that prevent the
dimerization between E2F-1 and its DP partners [reviewed
in 12, 13]. None to date have advanced to clinical trials for
the treatment of cancer.

While new anti-androgen therapies and new
chemotherapeutic drugs have increased the survival of
patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer, relapse
eventually occurs and patients succumb to this disease.
There continues to be a need for therapies with low
toxicity in this population that may be used alone or in
combination with currently approved treatments. In a
previous publication we described studies of a peptide
that inhibited transcription of E2F-1, and when coupled to
a modified penetratin sequence to enhance uptake (PEP),
and encapsulated in PEGylated liposomes (PL-PEP),
inhibited growth of a human small cell carcinoma tumor
in nude mice [1].
We targeted E2F, as the E2F family of transcription
factors is critical to many cellular processes, including

Herein we demonstrate that the PEP showed potent
in vitro antitumor activity against prostate cancer cells and
inhibition of tumor growth when xenografts of the castrate
resistant cell tumor Du-145 were treated with the PEP
encapsulated in PEGylated liposomes.

Table 1:Effect of the PEP on viability of prostate
tumor cells. Cells were treated with the PEP at various
concentrations for either 24 h (first column) or fresh drug
at the same concentation added daily x3 and then viability
measured at 96 h (second column).

RESULTS
Cytotoxicity studies in vitro
The Du-145 cell line was the most sensitive of the
prostate cancer cell lines to the PEP. Table I shows average
IC50 values for a 24 h exposure and a 72 h exposure to daily
administration of fresh drug. The IC50s were decreased
with daily administration, as was also noted previously
with the H-69 cell line [1], due to lack of stability in
culture media with FBS. Our previous study showed that
normal cell lines that included mesenchymal stem cells
and hematopoetic stem cells from human marrow, and
MEFs, were not affected by concentrations of 80 µM, the
highest concentrations tested [1].
We also tested a control PEP, with the 4 histidines
replaced by glycines and compared this peptide to the lead
PEP. As shown in Fig.1, the control peptide had little or
no effect on cell growth when assayed against the Du-145
cell line.

The PEP induces apoptosis
We observed that following a relatively short
exposure of 6h to the PEP, Du-145 and LnCaP cells
showed morphologic changes including loss of cell-cell
contact and disintegration of the cellular and nuclear
membrane indicating that the PEP was inducing apoptosis
(Fig 2a). In order to confirm this, Du-145 cells, most
sensitive to PEP, were treated with peptide for 6h at the
IC50 concentration. Cells were analyzed after Annexin

was obtained in several other cancer cell types and PEP

Inhibitory effect of the PEP on the cell cycle

In our previous publication we showed that the
peptide inhibited the transcriptional activity of E2F1. To
confirm these results in the Du-145 cell line we performed
a ChIP assay to determine whether the peptide interfered
with binding of E2F1 to its consensus DNA sequence. PEP
treatment resulted in decreased PCR product following
immunoprecipitation of E2F-1 bound DNA as compared
to either control peptide treatment or no peptide treatment
(Fig 4a). As E2F-1 transcription has been reported to
regulate levels of enzymes essential for DNA synthesis,
we measured the effect of the PEP on E2F-1 levels as
well as certain enzymes required for synthesis of purines
and pyrimidines. Fig 4b shows down regulation of E2F1 protein, following PEP treatment of Du-145 cells. As
expected, the protein levels as well as mRNA (data not
shown) of its well defined downstream targets such as
thymidylate synthase (TS), and thymidine kinase (TK),
targets for clinically used anticancer drugs were also
down regulated in Du-145 cells as the transcription of
these mRNAs are regulated by E2F. Other targets such

Because E2F-1 plays an important role in cell cycle
progression from G1 to S phase, we examined the effect
of the peptide on the cell cycle of Du-145 cells. Cells were
arrested in G1/G0 by incubation in serum free media, and
after release into serum containing media the effect of the
PEP and control PEP on the entrance of the cells into S
phase was measured, using a concentration of the PEP that
was slightly below the IC50. After overnight treatment, we
observed that control PEP did not block cell progress from
G1 to S phase, whereas PEP treated cells had an increase
in the proportion of cells in G1/S of cell cycle with a
corresponding decline in the population of G2/M phase
cells (Fig 3a top and bottom panel). To determine if the
PEP caused alterations in signal transduction pathways,
DU145 cells were treated with 20 and 40 µM peptide for
24h. The PEP activated the ASK1/JNK signaling pathway
and inhibited the mTOR/PI3K pathway previously shown
to be important [14] in apoptosis/cell growth induced by

Xenograft studies

as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and ribonucleotide
reductase (RR) were also down regulated by the PEP (not
shown).

To increase the stability and tumor targeting of the
PEP for xenograft studies in mice, we encapsulated the
PEP in PEGylated liposomes (PL-PEP). We previously
reported that the PL-PEP was rapidly taken up by H-69
and Du-145 tumor cells and entered the nucleus [1].
Xenografts of the Du-145 tumor cells were used to test
the antitumor effects of the PL-PEP. Based on the MTD
from the H-69 study, [1], the liposome encapsulated PEP,
administered i.p @ 100 mg/Kg (0.2 ml) given every other
day x 4, caused regression of these tumors without any
observable toxicity (Fig 6a). As tumor growth recurred
soon after treatment was stopped, in a second study, the
PEGylated Pep was administered every other day @
100 mg/ kg for 7 doses to determine if more frequent
administration would prolong tumor growth inhibition
and to assess toxicity (Fig 6b). This study showed that
that tumor growth was inhibited as long as drug was
administered, but again, when the PL-PEP was stopped,
tumor growth resumed. No weight loss or toxicity was
noted (data not shown).

The combination of the PEP with MTX caused
synergistic cell kill
Based on our observation that E2F peptide downregulated certain target genes including DHFR, TS and
TK we hypothesized that the peptide would synergize
with inhibitors of these proteins required for S-Phase.
As the peptide not only lowered levels of DHFR, but
also thymidine kinase, thus also blocking the salvage
pathway, we tested fixed ratios of the PEP with MTX,
above and below the IC50 values for the individual
drugs, and analyzed the results using the Chou-Talalay
method of analysis to determine synergy, additive effects
or antagonism [15]. At higher doses of MTX and PEP
synergistic cell kill (CI values < 1.0) was observed as
shown in Fig 5a and 5b.

Fig 6: Xenograft studies. Male mice (20-22 g) were

inoculated subcutaneously with five million Du-145 cells and
an equal volume of matrigel. When the tumors were palpable
approximately 50-100 mm3, the animals were randomized into
groups of 6 and either treated with 100 mg/kg of the PL-PEP,
every other day for 4 doses (Fig 6a) or every other day for 7
doses ( Fig 6b). Tumor size and animal weight was measured
every three days.

demonstrates synergism of the combination of PEP
and MTX in Du-145 cells. 200 Du-145cells were seeded in 6
well plates. PEP and MTX were added at various concentrations.
After 2 weeks, colonies were counted and data shown in Fig 5a.

DISCUSSION

1 in DNA repair [5].

The well-demonstrated association of E2F over
expression (i.e. oncogene addiction) with maintenance of
the malignant phenotype makes it an attractive target for
new antitumor strategies. E2F-1 levels, as well as E2F-3
levels have been shown to be increased in several human
cancers [16-21]. In some tumors over expression has been
linked to amplification of the E2F-1 gene, which maps
to 20q11.2 in the human genome [20]. Increased E2F-1
expression correlates with a poorer outcome in certain
cancers such as lung cancer [11], and malignant melanoma
[22]. A recent report also related over expression with
melanoma progression and metastasis in a preclinical
model [23]. Given the role of E2F family of transcription
factors in proliferation and tumor progression and
metastasis, there have been several efforts to target one
or more of the E2Fs as an antitumor strategy [reviewed
in 12,13].
We reported previously that a peptide isolated by it’s
ability to bind tightly to an immobilized consensus E2F1 sequence isolated from a phage display library downregulated expression of not only E2F-1 and E2F-3 but not
E2F-2 and 4 [1]. When coupled to penetratin and modified
further by replacing the methionine in the pentratin peptide
by isoleucine, as this substitution allowed the PEP to be
generated recombinantly (unpublished). The penetratin
peptide (PEP) showed cytotoxic effects against several
but not all human malignant cell lines and was not toxic
at higher concentrations against normal human marrow
hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells [1].
To enhance stability and the half -life of the PEP for
in vivo studies we encapsulated the PEP into PEGylated
liposomes. Regression of the H-69 SCLC xenografts,
even when advanced resulted [1]. In this study we show
that while the Du-145 cell line was less sensitive to the
PEP as compared to the H-69 small cell cancer cell line,
DU-145 ) xenografts also regressed when treated with the
PL-PEP. Downstream effects of E2F inhibition resulted in
down regulation of proteins that are targets for clinically
useful chemotherapeutic drugs, including methotrexate
(MTX, inhibitor of DHFR), the 5-fluoropyrimidines and
pemetrexed (inhibitors of TS) and hydroxyurea (inhibitor
of RR). Drugs that target these enzymes together with
agents that lower E2F activity would be predicted to result
in enhanced anti tumor effects. As an example of how this
knowledge may lead to an effective drug combination with
the PEP together with drugs that target these enzymes, we
show that MTX and the PEP exhibit synergistic cell kill,
likely due to decreased levels of DHFR and TK, the latter
enzyme important for thymidine salvage.
Studies in progress will determine the effect
of longer durations of treatment with the peptide,
mechanisms of resistance and combinations of the peptide
with agents used to treat prostate cancer, that include
taxotere and DNA damaging agents, given the role of E2F-
