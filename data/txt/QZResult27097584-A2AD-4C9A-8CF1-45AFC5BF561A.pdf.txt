BACKGROUND: Despite the observed association between diabetes mellitus and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), little is known about the effect of diabetes duration before HCC diagnosis and whether some diabetes medications
reduced the risk of HCC development. This objective of the current study was to determine the association between
HCC risk and diabetes duration and type of diabetes treatment. METHODS: A total of 420 patients with HCC and
1104 healthy controls were enrolled in an ongoing hospital-based case-control study. Multivariate logistic regression
models were used to adjust for HCC risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 33.3% in patients
with HCC and 10.4% in the control group, yielding an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 4.2 (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 3.0-5.9). In 87% of cases, diabetes was present before the diagnosis of HCC, yielding an AOR of 4.4 (95% CI, 3.06.3). Compared with patients with a diabetes duration of 2 to 5 years, the estimated AORs for those with a diabetes
duration of 6 to 10 years and those with a diabetes duration >10 years were 1.8 (95% CI, 0.8-4.1) and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.24.8), respectively. With respect to diabetes treatment, the AORs were 0.3 (95% CI, 0.2-0.6), 0.3 (95% CI, 0.1-0.7), 7.1
(95% CI, 2.9-16.9), 1.9 (95% CI, 0.8-4.6), and 7.8 (95% CI, 1.5-40.0) for those treated with biguanides, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, insulin, and dietary control, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes appears to increase the risk
of HCC, and such risk is correlated with a long duration of diabetes. Relying on dietary control and treatment with
sulfonylureas or insulin were found to confer the highest magnitude of HCC risk, whereas treatment with biguanides
or thiazolidinediones was associated with a 70% HCC risk reduction among diabetics. Cancer 2010;116:1938–46.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and inadequate secretion of or receptor

insensitivity to endogenous insulin,1 and it is a major public health problem and the fifth leading cause of death in the
United States.2,3 This high death rate is partially due to the high incidence of renal and heart diseases among patients with
diabetes mellitus.3,4 In addition, diabetes is associated with increased risks of colon, kidney, and pancreatic cancers.5
Because the liver plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism, it is not surprising that diabetes mellitus is an epiphenomenon of many chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, fatty liver, liver failure, and cirrhosis. The association
between diabetes mellitus and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported by cohort6-9 and case-control studies.10-12 Although such an association could be related to the underlying chronic liver diseases that preceded the development of HCC,13-16 there are several lines of evidence suggesting that diabetes is in fact an independent risk factor for
HCC development. This evidence includes 1) results from review and meta-analysis reports concluding that diabetes is a
risk factor of HCC,4,17-19 2) findings that the positive association between diabetes and HCC is independent of underlying cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases,11,16 3) findings that the association is positively correlated with disease duration,12,20,21 4) demonstration of the synergistic interaction between diabetes and other HCC risk factors,6,10,12 5)
findings of HCC recurrence after liver resection and transplantation among patients with diabetes,22,23 6) suggestion of a

biological plausibility that underlies the association
between diabetes and HCC,18,19,24 and 7) the observation
of risk of HCC development among patients with type 1
diabetes mellitus.10
Because diabetes mellitus is a complication of many
chronic liver diseases and because transient hyperglycemia
can be a symptom of metastatic tumors or side effect of
chemotherapy intake,25 detailed information regarding
patients’ duration of diabetes mellitus before HCC development may be crucial for properly studying the association between diabetes and HCC. Moreover, it is not
known whether diabetes control reduces the risk of HCC
or whether specific medication regimens for diabetes confer a high risk of developing HCC. Therefore, we
embarked on a case-control study to address these questions after controlling for established HCC risk factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Population
The current investigation is part of an ongoing hospitalbased case-control study that was approved by the institutional review board at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Written informed
consent for participation was obtained from each study
participant. Detailed description of cases and controls
were previously reported.26-28 Case patients were
recruited from the population of patients with newly diagnosed HCC who were evaluated and treated at the gastrointestinal medical oncology and surgical oncology
outpatient clinics at MDACC. The inclusion criteria were
as follows: pathologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC,
US residency, and the ability to communicate in English.
The exclusion criteria were the presence of other types of
primary liver cancer (such as cholangiocarcinoma or fibrolamellar hepatocarcinoma), unknown primary tumors,
and a concurrent or past history of cancer at another organ
site.
From January 2000 through July 2008, 652 patients
with suspected HCC were identified, 518 of whom were
eligible for this study. We enrolled 420 eligible patients
with HCC; 98 eligible patients (18.9%) were not
recruited because of patient refusal, patient sickness, or
inadequate time to complete the interview. Statistical
analyses indicated that the eligible patients who were not
recruited did not differ from the recruited patients in
terms of demographic, epidemiologic, or clinical factors
(retrieved from patients’ medical records).

The control subjects were healthy and genetically
unrelated family members (ie, spouses and in-laws) of
patients at MDACC who had cancers other than liver,
gastrointestinal, lung, or head and neck cancer. The
reason for excluding family members and spouses of
patients with these cancers as controls was to prevent the
introduction of selection bias connected with shared environmental and genetic factors that are highly associated
with HCC (eg, alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus,
smoking, family history of cancer, and hepatitis virus
infection).
The eligibility criteria for controls were the same as
those for patients, except for having a cancer diagnosis.
Control subjects were recruited from various diagnostic
radiology clinics of MDACC, where cancer patients and
their companions are sent to receive the initial cancer diagnosis or treatment follow-up examination. A short
structured questionnaire was used to screen for potential
controls on the basis of the eligibility criteria. Analysis of
the answers received on the short questionnaire indicated
that 83.6% of those questioned agreed to participate in
clinical research. A comparison of those recruited as controls and those who refused to participate in the research
revealed no significant differences in age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, personal history of cancer, or the
accompanied patient’s type of cancer.
We sought to confirm the control subjects’ reasons
for coming to the hospital with cancer patients and
whether these reasons could have been related to the risk
factors for HCC. We found that the underlying causes for
the controls’ companionship were care and altruism.
Moreover, all spouses of patients with other cancers who
served as control subjects reported that they would have
chosen to be referred to MDACC if they had been diagnosed with cancer during the same time period because
they tended to share the same family physician, had the
same health insurance coverage, and lived in the same geographic location. All of the above mentioned results indicated that the patients and controls had the same
catchments, which further supported the idea that the
control subjects were representative of the MDACC population from which HCC patients were selected.29-31 A
total of 1286 eligible control subjects were ascertained in
the current study. However, 172 control subjects were
excluded due to limited blood samples for testing hepatitis
B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) markers. An
additional 10 control subjects were excluded for living
outside the United States, leaving a total of 1104 control
subjects to be analyzed in this study.

HCC patients and controls were recruited simultaneously and were personally interviewed for approximately 25 to 30 minutes. No proxy interviews were
conducted. The interviewers used a structured and validated questionnaire32 to collect information regarding demographic features and HCC risk factors, such as
personal smoking history, alcohol consumption, medical
history, occupational history, and family history of cancer.
The definitions used for smokers, alcohol drinkers, and
individuals with a family history of cancer were previously
reported.26-28
Diabetes Mellitus
Each participant was questioned about his or her prior
history of diabetes mellitus, the type of diabetes (insulintreated or non–insulin-treated), the age at diagnosis, and
the duration of each type of diabetes. Subjects with a history of diabetes were questioned about medications used
for diabetes control and the duration of treatment. Oral
antidiabetic agents used were classified as biguanides (eg,
metformin), sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide, glipizide), and
thiazolidinediones (eg, rosiglitazone).33
Hepatitis Virus Infection
Blood samples from cases and controls were tested for
HBV and hepatitis C virus HCV. HCV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core (HBc) antigen were detected by use of a thirdgeneration enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay
(ELISA) (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill). Positive results prompted repeated confirmatory ELISA
testing.
Statistical Analysis
Stata software (Stata Corp, College Station, Tex) was used
for statistical analysis. Univariate analysis was performed
using the chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. To test for the association between diabetes and
HCC, we performed multivariable unconditional logistic
regression analyses using all variables significant at P <
.05 in the univariable analyses and have a confounding
effect on the association between diabetes and HCC. To
determine the association between HCC development
and diabetes duration and diabetes treatment, we performed restricted analysis among diabetic cases and controls. For each factor, we calculated the adjusted odds
ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI),
using maximum likelihood estimation. All odds ratios

1940

(ORs) were adjusted for age, sex, race, education level, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus,
family history of cancer, and HBV/HCV infection. The
final model was chosen on the basis of biological plausibility and the lowest 2 log likelihood function.

RESULTS
The baseline demographic characteristics of patients and
controls are summarized in Table 1. Most study subjects
were non-Hispanic white men; the men-to-women ratio
was 2.5 to 1 for HCC patients. Case patients were slightly
older than control subjects, with a mean difference of 3
years (95% CI 2-5; the mean [ standard error (SE)] ages
were 63  .6 years for HCC patients and 60  .3 years for
controls.
Table 2 shows that the prevalences of hepatitis virus
infection (detected by anti-HCV, HBsAg, or anti-HBc),
cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and family history of cancer were significantly higher for cases than for
controls. Our previous reports from the same population
indicated that each factor is an independent risk factor for
HCC development.26-28
A total of 140 HCC patients (33.3%) and 115 controls (10.4%) recalled a prior history of diabetes mellitus
that conferred a 4-fold increase in HCC risk when compared with nondiabetic individuals (P ¼ .001; AOR, 4.2
[95% CI, 3.0-5.9]) (Fig. 1). The prevalence of diabetes
mellitus stratified by demographic characteristics (Table
1) and HCC risk factors (Table 2) was significantly higher
in cases than in controls.
The significant risk of HCC development among
patients with diabetes mellitus was observed for both men
(AOR, 5.2; 95% CI, 3.3-8.3 [P < .001]) and women
(AOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6-6 [P ¼ .001]).
To ensure that diabetes was not induced by the cancer, analysis of the association between diabetes and HCC
risk was restricted to those who were diagnosed with diabetes more than 1 year before HCC diagnosis or before
control recruitment (122 cases and 86 controls) (Fig. 1);
the AORs were 4.4 (95% CI, 3.0-6.3) for all subjects, 5.2
(95% CI, 3.3-8.3) for men, and 3.5 (95% CI, 1.7-7.1) for
women.
Table 3 presented results of restricted analyses
among diabetic cases and controls. The estimated AORs
of developing HCC were 1.8 (95% CI, 0.8-4.1) for
patients diagnosed with diabetes 6 to 10 years before
HCC diagnosis and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-4.8) for those with
a duration of diabetes >10 years.

Original Article

We found no significant association between early
onset of diabetes diagnosis (age <50 years) and risk of
HCC development. Moreover, we found no correlations
between duration of diabetes and patients’ age or types of
treatment in this study population.

Figure 1. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in cases
(n ¼ 420) and controls (n ¼ 1104) and the adjusted odds
ratio (AOR) for the association between the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and diabetes according to
the duration of diabetes (all, 1 year, and >1 year) are shown.
Odds ratios were adjusted for the confounding effect of age,
sex, race, educational level, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and family history of
cancer using unconditional multivariable logistic regression
analyses. Duration of diabetes was missing for 2 patients
with HCC. 95% CI indicates 95% confidence interval.

Among patients who had diabetes for more than a
year, most subjects were considered to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and were receiving an oral antidiabetic regimen, yielding an inverse association with HCC for all
subjects (AOR, 0.3; P ¼.009). A total of 16 HCC case
patients and 2 control subjects with diabetes reported relying on diet alone to control diabetes, yielding a significantly higher risk of HCC development (AOR, 7.8; 95%
CI, 1.5-40). The majority of diabetic patients receiving
oral antidiabetic regimens received agents in the biguanide
and sulfonylurea classes. The AORs for HCC association
with biguanide use were 0.3 (95% CI, 0.2-0.6) for all subjects, 0.3 (95% CI, 0.1-0.7) for men, and 0.2 (95% CI,
0.1-0.9) for women. Only 6 HCC patients and 16 controls received thiazolidinedione-class agents, which demonstrated a 70% risk reduction in HCC development
(Table 3). Use of the sulfonylurea class of oral antidiabetics had a much higher association with HCC development: the AORs were 7.1 (95% CI, 2.9-16.9) for all
subjects, 5.3 (95% CI, 1.9-14.2) for men, and 12.3 (95%
CI, 1.6-96.9) for women. Moreover, insulin use was associated with risk for HCC development compared with the
use of oral modalities, however, the association was not
statistical significant (P ¼ .1).

1942

DISCUSSION
Results from the current study suggests that the magnitude
of association between diabetes and HCC increased as the
duration of diabetes increased and with specific antidiabetic treatment. A notable finding is that the use of sulfonylurea drugs (such as glyburide) among diabetics revealed
a 7-fold increase in HCC risk compared with nonusers.
Moreover, diabetic patients who were treated with exogenous insulin were at a higher risk for HCC development as
compared with noninsulin treatment group; however,
such elevated risk was not statistically significant.
Insulin sensitizing agents such as biguanides (including metformin) and thiazolidinediones are alternative
options for treating obese patients with diabetes mellitus
or patients with underlying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In the
current study, the use of metformin or thiazolidinediones
was associated with a 70% risk reduction of HCC compared with the use of insulin or sulfonylureas.
The above findings of the elevated risk associated
with the use of insulin or sulfonylureas and the reduced
risk associated with the use of biguanide (metformin) are
in agreement with newly published study by Donadon et
al among Italian patients with cirrhosis and HCC,34
which reported a significantly increased risk of HCC
among diabetic patients treated with insulin and sulfonylureas (OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.34-6.65) and reduced HCC
risk among diabetic patients treated with metformin (OR,
0.33; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7). Moreover, Bowker et al35
reported that patients with type 2 diabetes exposed to sulfonylureas and exogenous insulin had a significant risk of
cancer-related mortality compared with patients exposed
to metformin. Both studies are in agreement with an earlier report by Evans et al36 who observed lower incidence
of cancer among diabetic patients treated with metformin
compared with other diabetes treatments. Interestingly,
such risk reduction was associated with duration and dosage of metformin treatment.
The results of the current study are consistent with
the notion that the biological mechanism for liver-cell
damage induced by type 2 diabetes mellitus involves insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.4,37 HCC development related to hyperinsulinemia can be mediated

through inflammation, cellular proliferation, inhibition
of apoptosis, and mutation of tumor suppressor genes.4
Increased insulin levels lead to reduced liver synthesis and
blood levels of insulin growth factor-binding protein-1,
which may contribute to increased bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the promotion of cellular proliferation, and the inhibition of apoptosis.38
Insulin also binds to the insulin receptor and activates its
intrinsic tyrosine kinase, leading to phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1).39 Both IGF-1 and
IRS-1 have been overexpressed in tumor cells.40 Overexpression of IRS-1 has been associated with the prevention
of apoptosis mediated by transforming growth factor-b.41
In addition, insulin is associated with lipid peroxidation
and increased oxidative stress and the generation of reactive oxygen species, which may contribute to DNA mutation. In fact, lipid peroxidation has been implicated in the

gene mutations.42
Metformin can reduce blood glucose in diabetic
patients, predominantly through reduction of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.33,43,44 It also increases
the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the skeletal
muscles, suppresses oxidation of fatty acids, and reduces
triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.
All of these effects may contribute to reducing hyperinsulinemia, improving hepatic insulin resistance, reducing
steatosis, improving liver enzymes, and reducing body
weight.
Although to our knowledge the molecular mechanisms of metformin’s antidiabetic activity have yet to be
fully identified, experimental studies in ob/ob mice indicated that the key role of metformin may be related to

decreased hepatic expression of tumor necrosis factor-a, a
cytokine that promotes insulin resistance.45 The beneficial effect of metformin treatment among patients with
NAFLD was assessed by small-scale trials; improvement
in liver enzymes, steatosis, and fibrosis was noted.46-48
However, a recently reported study by Haukeland et al49
indicated that metformin treatment for 6 months was not
better than placebo in terms of improving liver histology
in patients with NAFLD, even though body weight and
metabolic profile improved significantly.
Unlike metformin, the use of sulfonylureas is associated with weight gain, hyperinsulinemia, and hepatotoxicity.50 Therefore, it may not be the appropriate diabetes
treatment for patients with underlying chronic liver diseases, obesity, or insulin resistance because of possible
exacerbation of the underlying NAFLD or NASH
observed in these patients and possible acceleration of
HCC development.51
Although the mechanism for the antineoplastic activity of metformin is not fully understood, there is substantial evidence suggesting that metformin suppresses
cellular proliferation and protein synthesis with AMP-independent protein kinase activation in both malignant
and nonmalignant cells.52,53 A recent review by Cazzaniga
et al54 reported that such AMP-activated protein kinase
actions may be mediated by multiple pathways, including
up-regulation of the p53 and reduction of cyclin D1 levels, which may eventually lead to antiproliferative effect.
However, although the intake of thiazolidinediones
was found to be significantly associated with reduced risk
of HCC, only 6 HCC patients with diabetes recalled
using this medication, which may not be enough to conclude the protective effect of thiazolidinediones treatment
on HCC development.
In this study, cases were pathologically confirmed
HCC patients who were newly diagnosed and prospectively enrolled in the study in which both cases and controls were personally and simultaneously interviewed,
using a structured, validated questionnaire. Control subjects were selected to represent the study population from
which cases were selected. To ensure the accuracy of our
data, subjects with a history of diabetes were asked about
the duration of their disorder, their age at diagnosis, and
their treatment exposure. Questions of prior history of diabetes mellitus along with other chronic medical conditions were part of a long list of questions in which study
subjects were blinded for the current study hypothesis and
its specific aims. It is reasonable to assume that subjects
who had received a definite diagnosis and had been

1944

treated could accurately report their prior history of medical conditions and recalled the condition duration. Upon
reviewing the medical records of HCC patients, we found
no discrepancy between interview information and
patients’ records. In fact, there is strong evidence supporting the reliability and validity of self-reported diabetes
mellitus when agreement between self-reported disease diagnosis and medical conditions was observed.55-57 It is
partially attributable to patients’ awareness of diabetes
complications and the importance to monitor blood sugar
during treatment. Therefore, it is not surprising that
patients with diabetes mellitus tend to remember the
name of exposed medications with and without therapeutic response during their lifetime.
The current study did have some limitations. Overweight and obesity may have a confounding effect on the
observed association between diabetes and HCC and
might modulate the antidiabetic treatment selection.
Nevertheless, we have collected information regarding
subjects’ weight before HCC diagnosis or before control
ascertainment. Such data were initiated in 2004 and are
available for 184 HCC patients and 648 controls. Results
indicated that the mean body mass index (BMI) at early
age (between 20 and 40 years of age) (SE) was significantly larger in HCC patients (24.06  0.3) than in controls (23.04  0.1) (P ¼ .001). However, adjustment for
the effect of prior BMI did not meaningfully change the
observed significant association between diabetes and
HCC; the estimated OR was 3.8 (95% CI, 2.3-6.1).
Although obesity is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus
and HCC, obesity is not necessarily present in patients
with NAFLD; a significant portion of patients with
NAFLD have a normal body weight.58 Therefore, it is not
surprising that the association between diabetes and HCC
is not confounded by obesity in the current study and
other studies.6,7
We also noted that most patients with diabetes were
treated with oral antidiabetic drugs, implicating type 2 diabetes. Although we do not know why some patients with
type 2 diabetes received insulin treatment, it is possible
that insulin was given to some patients for whom safety
and efficacy considerations favor its use as the drug of
choice, for example, patients with severe hepatic or renal
impairment. It may also indicate that the diabetes was
severe or that some patients required insulin therapy,
either as monotherapy or in conjunction with oral
antidiabetic therapy, to maintain long-term glycemic control. However, we lacked information regarding fasting
blood glucose, diabetes complications, and glycosylated

hemoglobin to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. This information is
crucial to explain whether severity of diabetes is correlated
with duration and type of treatment and why some diabetic
patients with dietary control are at high risk for HCC development. Future large cohort studies among diabetic patients
with detailed information concerning family history of diabetes, type of diabetes, diabetes treatment, response to diabetes therapy, diabetes-related complications, and
clinicopathologic changes in liver tissues may reveal the explanation for the relationship between diabetes and HCC
development reported by case-control studies.
The preliminary findings of the current study may
indicate that choosing an appropriate and safe treatment
for diabetes mellitus is critical in patients with underlying
liver diseases. The need for developing specific guidelines
for treating diabetic patients with underlying liver diseases—with consideration of subjects’ BMI and whether
they have NAFLD or NASH—is warranted. Such guidelines should outline appropriate and safe treatment for
these patients, with the ultimate goal of preventing progressive liver disease and HCC development. Future studies should be aimed at investigating the preventive role of
metformin on HCC development.
