BACKGROUND: Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/
myeloproliferative neoplasm is associated with a poor prognosis. The authors evaluated predictive factors in patients
with secondary AML treated with anthracycline-based induction therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective review
of secondary AML patients treated with induction therapy. Age, International Prognostic Scoring System, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, cytogenetics, duration of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm, and prior
MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm treatment were evaluated for their impact on complete response (CR), CR with
low platelets, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The authors evaluated 61 secondary AML patients who received
induction chemotherapy; 59% (36 patients) achieved CR/CR with low platelets (95% confidence interval [CI], 46%71%), and median OS was 6.5 (95% CI, 3.9-8.1) months. Three factors were associated with lower CR/CR with low platelets and OS: poor risk cytogenetics, prior treatment with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, and longer time
to transformation to AML. Of those treated with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, 32% achieved CR/CR with
low platelets versus 78% in the group not treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide (odds ratio [OR],
0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.42). Median OS for those treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide was 3.7 versus
10.5 months for those not treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide (P < .0001). The CR/CR with low
platelets rate for those with intermediate risk cytogenetics was 70% versus 35% for those with poor risk (OR, 4.33;
95% CI, 1.38-13.6). Those with poor risk cytogenetics had a median OS of 2.8 versus 7.5 months for those with intermediate risk (P ¼ .01). CONCLUSIONS: Prior treatment with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, poor risk cytogenetics, and longer time to transformation to AML are independent negative predictive factors for response and OS

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignancy characterized by a clonal proliferation of neoplastic hematopoietic
progenitor cells. These malignant cells exhibit differentiation arrest, a higher proliferative index, and failure to undergo
apoptosis.1 The overall incidence of AML is 3.4 cases per 100,000 people in the United States, with the median age at
diagnosis being 67 years.2 Approximately 50% to 75% of adults with de novo AML achieve complete remission after
induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline. However, only 20% to 30% of patients enjoy long-term
disease-free survival.2,3
Established prognostic factors in AML include age, cytogenetic profile, and the presence of an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasm.4,5 Older adults with AML have a higher frequency of poor risk
karyotypes and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm; up to 40% of elderly patients with AML had previously been diagnosed with MDS.4,6-11 Given these adverse risk factors, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for older adults with AML is
<10%.4,5

Original Article

Recently approved treatments, such as the hypomethylating agents (ie, azacitidine, decitabine), have been
shown to improve survival in patients with higher risk
MDS.12,13 In addition, recent data have shown that
lenalidomide provides meaningful clinical responses in
patients with lower risk MDS associated with deletion
5q.14 However, response rates and survival with standard
induction chemotherapy after progression to AML after
initial treatment with those newer modalities have not
been well studied.12-14 In this study, we examined the
impact of prior treatment with hypomethylating agents or
lenalidomide on response rate and outcomes in patients
with secondary acute myeloid leukemia in the context of
other well-known prognostic factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective chart review was done to evaluate adult
patients with secondary AML from antecedent MDS,
myeloproliferative neoplasm, or MDS/myeloproliferative
neoplasm who had been treated with induction chemotherapy at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research
Institute between January 1, 2004, and April 30, 2008.
Induction chemotherapy in the majority of our patients
consisted of the 7 þ 3 regimen, which includes cytarabine
100 mg/m2 for 7 days combined with 3 days of an
anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin).15 Of the 61
patients, 40 received a 7 þ 3 regimen, and the remainder
received a high-dose cytarabine-based regimen. Fourteen
of the 61 patients received an investigational therapy combined with 7 þ 3 or high-dose cytarabine.
Patient Population
The following were inclusion criteria for this study: 1)
histologically proven diagnosis of AML, 2) previous histologically proven diagnosis of MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm, and 3) receipt of induction
chemotherapy at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and
Research Institute for secondary AML. The diagnosis of
AML was defined using the World Health Organization
(WHO)’s definition of >20% blasts in the bone marrow
or peripheral blood.16
Data were collected from review of electronic
records, pathology reports, and pharmacy records. Variables collected included the following: age at diagnosis of
AML; karyotype at diagnosis of AML; prior therapy for
MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasm, or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm; duration of MDS, myeloproliferative
neoplasm, or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm before

1464

AML diagnosis; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status before initiation of induction chemotherapy for AML; WHO category of MDS or
MDS/myeloproliferative disease overlap syndrome at diagnosis; and International Prognostic Scoring System
score. Patient karyotypes at the time of AML diagnosis
were placed into 3 categories: good risk (t[15;17], t[8;21],
or inv16), poor risk (complex karyotype defined as 3 or
more chromosomal abnormalities, del 5/5q, del 7/7q, trisomy 8), and intermediate risk (all those not in the poor
risk group and not in the good risk group).17
Study Endpoints
The study endpoints included rate of complete response
(CR) or complete response with low platelets to induction
chemotherapy for secondary AML according to the International Working Group criteria, OS, and disease-free
survival (DFS). DFS was defined only for patients who
achieved CR or CR with low platelets, and it is the time
from date of CR/CR with low platelets to date of relapse
or death. If no relapse or death, DFS was censored at the
time of last follow-up. OS was defined for all patients, and
it is the time from date of AML induction therapy to date
of death. Similarly, if no death, OS was censored at the
time of last follow-up. CR status was confirmed at our
institution by bone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood
cell count.
Statistical Analysis
Data were summarized by using statistics such as means,
medians, and ranges for continuous variables and numbers and percentages for discrete variables. Both univariate
and multivariate analyses were implemented to explore
relationships between various disease characteristics or demographic variables and outcomes (ie, response [CR/CR
with low platelets], DFS, and OS) of the induction chemotherapy for secondary AML patients. Nonparametric
methods such as Fisher exact test for binary outcomes and
the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier product limit estimate
for time to event variables as well as (semi-)parametric
approaches (eg, logistic regression and Cox proportional
hazards regression models) were used, when appropriate,
to study potential effects of these variables on the induction treatment outcome for secondary AML. Both point
estimates of parameters of interest (eg, response rate, odds
ratio [OR], and hazard ratio) and their 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were reported, when feasible. Stepwise
regression approach was used in multivariate analyses to
study which set of variables had the predictive ability for

the outcome variables in this study with an entry probability of .1 and a stay probability of .05. Sample size was
always taken into consideration to decide whether a particular statistical method was appropriate to use.
A P value of < .05 was considered statistically significant. No multiple testing adjustments for P value were
performed because of small sample size. Because of the exploratory nature of this study, it was not powered to confirm or refute any specific hypothesis.

RESULTS
By using the criteria of treatment between January 1,
2004 and April 30, 2008, we evaluated a total of 61
patients with secondary AML. The baseline characteristics
of the group are summarized in Table 1. The majority of
the patients were men (67%) with a median age of 66
years. The median time to development of AML from the
diagnosis of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm was 8
months (range, 0.5-82; mean [standard deviation]: 15
[18] months). The median follow-up time for surviving
AML patients was 18 months (range, 1.4-54 months). Of
note, about 1=3 of patients had an adverse cytogenetic profile, whereas the other 2=3 had an intermediate risk profile.
Additional molecular information such as FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) or nucleophosmin (NPM) status
was not included in this study. The majority of patients
did not have this information available. For patients who
received prior definitive (nongrowth factor) therapy for
MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm, the vast majority (23
of 27) received 5-azacitidine.
The overall response rate (CR/CR with low platelets) for the entire group was 59%. Table 2 summarizes
univariate analysis for various factors. In addition to the
factors listed in Table 2, the time from MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm diagnosis to the development of AML
was a predictive factor for response to AML induction
treatment. Univariably, time to development of AML on
a log scale had an unadjusted OR of 0.53 (P ¼ .02) for 1
U (ie, 2.7 months) of increase, favoring those who had a
shorter duration of their MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm. The type of therapy administered for prior MDS/
myeloproliferative neoplasm had a significant impact on
the patient’s response to AML induction therapy. Patients
who received hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide for
the treatment of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm had
an inferior rate of CR/CR with low platelets to induction
chemotherapy compared with patients who only received
supportive care for MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm,

to AML did not change from those reported at MDS diagnosis in the vast majority of patients. Neither the WHO
subtype of prior MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm nor
the International Prognostic Scoring System score had an
effect on response to induction therapy. In addition, sex,
age, and ECOG performance status did not seem to predict the response rate in this study (Table 2).
In multivariate analysis, only 3 variables correlated
with response rates to induction chemotherapy (Table 3).
Treatment of prior MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm
with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide was associ-

1466

ated with an adjusted OR of obtaining a CR with standard
AML induction therapy of 0.13 (95% CI, 0.04-0.51).
Poor risk cytogenetics at the time of transformation to
AML also had a negative effect, with an adjusted OR of
0.17 (95% CI, 0.04-0.69). In addition to prior therapy
for MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm and poor risk cytogenetics, the time from diagnosis of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm to AML transformation (on a log scale)
negatively affected the likelihood of response to induction
therapy, with an adjusted OR of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.19-0.82)
for 1 U (ie, 2.7 months) of increase in time to AML.
Disease-free survival and OS results for secondary
AML patients treated with induction chemotherapy were
also negatively affected by prior MDS/myeloproliferative
neoplasm treatment with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide. The median disease-free survival for those
patients who received treatment with a hypomethylating
agent or lenalidomide before developing AML was 3.6
months, compared with 10.5 months (P ¼ .02) for those
who received supportive care/other (Fig. 1). Patients who

had a median OS of 3.7 months, compared with 10.5

48 deaths in the entire cohort, and only 3 were within the
first 30 days of induction therapy. The remaining 45
deaths occurred after the 30-day time frame, with 32 of
these deaths occurring >60 days from the start of induction therapy.
Poor risk cytogenetics at the time of transformation
to AML was also associated with significantly inferior OS.

Cancer

April 1, 2011

The median OS for patients with poor risk cytogenetics
was 2.8 months, compared with 7.5 months for those
with intermediate risk cytogenetics (Table 4; P ¼ .01).
None of the patients in this analysis had good risk cytogenetics (Table 1).
In addition, time to AML transformation and age
affected OS. The hazard ratio was 1.40 for each unit
increase in time to transformation to AML on a log scale
(ie, 2.7-month increase) for OS (95% CI, 1.06-1.85; P ¼
.017). Older age also appeared to be marginally significant
in predicting worse OS (Table 4; P ¼ .04). No other covariates seemed to predict DFS or OS in the univariate analysis in this study.
Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that
the same 3 factors that were associated with response were
also significantly associated with OS (all P < .04). Poor
risk cytogenetics, prior treatment with hypomethylating
agents or lenalidomide, and longer time to transformation
to AML were all associated with an inferior OS (P < .04;
Table 5). Although prior MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm treatment type was significant in the univariate
analysis of DFS, because of the relatively small number of

responses (36 in this study) no multiple Cox regression
analysis of DFS was performed.
The response to prior therapy with hypomethylating
agents or lenalidomide before transformation to AML
could not be analyzed with any statistical significance
because of the small sample size. However, it was noted
that 5 of the 21 patients treated with hypomethylating
agents or lenalidomide for their MDS had a response to
treatment based on the International Working Group criteria.18 Of these 5, only 1 had a CR after induction therapy for AML. The remaining 16 patients did not have a
response to treatment with hypomethylating agents or
lenalidomide. Of these 16 patients, only 6 had a CR after
induction therapy for AML.

DISCUSSION
The traditional risk factors associated with poor outcome
in AML, which include age, adverse karyotype, and the
presence of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm, are well
established and validated. With the advent of novel treatments for both MDS and AML, however, it is necessary
to reinvestigate the importance of these risk factors in the
context of new therapies. Given the impact of such new
therapies upon the natural history of MDS, it may be
expected that the efficacy and/or toxicity of subsequent
treatments will be affected by prior therapy within an
individual patient.
In light of recent advances in the treatment of MDS
that appear to affect its natural history, this study was performed to revisit the impact of several variables on the
outcomes of patients with secondary AML who underwent standard induction therapy. Although traditional
poor risk features such as adverse karyotype remained a
negative prognostic marker, we found that the prior
administration of hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide during the period of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm was independently and adversely associated with

1468

response rates and survival. In addition, a more prolonged
time span from onset of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm to AML transformation negatively affected outcomes in these patients, suggesting that a protracted
natural history of the MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm
may select for higher rates of chemotherapy resistance after AML develops.
The reason for the negative impact induced by prior
hypomethylating agent therapy for MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm upon induction chemotherapy outcomes in
AML is unclear, although several hypotheses may be
entertained. One possible hypothesis is the development
of resistance via changes in critical metabolic enzymes,
including deoxycytidine kinase, as well as the generation
of aberrant nucleoside metabolism, which resulted in less
incorporation of decitabine into DNA.19 This resulted in
an impairment of hypomethylation and gene reactivation.
Another hypothesis is the up-regulation of the multidrug
resistance (MDR) gene. MDR has been documented as a
major cause of chemotherapy resistance in AML.19 The
MDR1 gene has been shown to be regulated by such epigenetic changes as methylation and acetylation.20-22
These studies have demonstrated that, in the human
MDR1 gene, the promoter is always hypermethylated in
drug-sensitive cells, and drug-resistant cells have a hypomethylated MDR1 promoter. A study by Kantharidis et al
showed that treatment of leukemia cell lines with decitabine resulted in demethylation of the MDR1 gene and
resulted in the gene’s activation.23 In our study, based
upon small numbers only, the seemingly lower response
rate to AML induction after previous response to hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide during MDS phase
could theoretically be because of emergence of secondary
resistance.
Although the results of our study are interesting, the
study does have several limitations. One of the criticisms
of the study is a higher than expected CR rate for the
cohort. CR was confirmed at our center, and only 7 of the
36 documented CRs were CRs with low platelet counts.
The rest were full CRs per the International Working
Group criteria. This could be partly explained by the
small sample size of our study; however, this could also be
partly explained by the finding that our institution is
aggressive in treating AML, so that patients frequently
undergo multiple induction regimens to obtain a CR. In
our study, 19 of 61 patients received a second induction
therapy with a high-dose cytarabine-containing combination. Another limitation is that this is a retrospective
study. The retrospective nature of the study does not allow

Cancer

for definitive conclusions to be made; rather, it is more
conducive to generating hypotheses for future prospective
studies.
In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that
patients with secondary AML who receive prior therapy
for their MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm may be better
served by novel approaches rather than conventional
induction chemotherapy. In addition, stratification for
these risk factors should be considered in future clinical
trials.
