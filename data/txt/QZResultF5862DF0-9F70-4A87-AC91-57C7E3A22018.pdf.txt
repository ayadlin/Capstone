ABSTRACT
Several observational studies have shown that metformin can modify the risk and
survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with diabetes mellitus, although the
magnitude of this relationship has not been determined. We conducted an updated
systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the association between metformin
and CRC mortality and searched relevant databases up to July 2016. The primary
outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were cancer-specific survival
(CS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Summary hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated
using a random-effects model. Seventeen studies enrolling 269,417 participants were
eligible for inclusion. Comparing with non-metformin users in diabetic CRC patients,
the summary HRs for OS in metformin users were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.61-0.77). Subgroup
analyses stratified by the study characteristics and sensitivity analysis by the trimand-fill method (adjusted HR 0.77, 95% CI, 0.67-0.87) confirmed the robustness of
the results. However, significant OS benefit was noted in patients with stage II and III
disease. Five studies reported the CRC prognosis for CS and three for DFS; metformin
intake was significantly associated with patient CS (HR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.59-0.94), but
not DFS (HR 0.38, 95% CI, 0.13-1.17). Our findings suggest that metformin intake
is associated with improved survival outcomes in terms of OS and CS in CRC patients
with diabetes, particular for OS in stage II and stage III patients. Further studies
should be conducted to determine CRC survival between metformin use and patient
specific clinical and molecular profiles.

kinase B (Akt)/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway pathways [8, 9]. Recent published study has also
shown that metformin exhibits an anti-apoptotic effect on
podocytes under high glucose conditions through activation
of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) and inhibition of mTOR signaling [10]. More
and more researches have focused on the potential role of
metformin as a combined drug for patients with cancer.
Metformin intake has been reported to be associated with
reduced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) as well as improved
survival in CRC patients [11–18], such as pathologic

INTRODUCTION
As a commonly used oral anti-hyperglycaemic
agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), metformin can
improve insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose
intake and utilization [1]. It has also been indicated that
insulin might play an important role in tumorigenesis.
Numerous epidemiologic studies have reported that
metformin is associated with decreased risk of cancer
incidence [2–7]. Metformin is supposed to inhibit cellular
growth and proliferation by lowering insulin levels
through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein

with chemoradiotherapy [19]. Several meta-analyses have
also examined the association between metformin and CRC
survival [20, 21]. However, these systematic reviwews are
quite preliminary with limited number of studies included
and low statistical power to draw a definite conclusion.
Moreover, the findings of previous meta-analyses were
difficult to interprete due to heterogeneity in patient/
population selection, metformin exposure, outcome
measures, and study design. During the last two years,
several related large cohorts were studied and the results
were published [13, 17, 22]. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to conduct an updated meta-analysis to systematically
renew the evidence about the association between metformin
intake and survival outcomes in CRC patient with DM.

place in USA and Canada (North America), six in Asia
and three in Europe. Ten studies recruited participants
from multiple centers, while seven recruited exclusively
from single centers. The median number of sample size
per study was 3816 (range, 482-111673). Nine of the
included studies were population-based cohort studies
and eight were hospital-based cohort studies. Two studies
enrolled patients with rectal cancer only, one study with
only colon cancer, while the other studies included
patients with both colon and rectal cancer. Thirteen of
the seventeen studies examined patients with CRC of all
stages (I-IV), while two studies enrolled only stage III
and stage IV patients, respectively, and another reported
I-III stage patients. Based on NOS criteria, out of nine
possible points, five studies received nine points, three
received eight points, three received seven points, two
received six points, three received five point, and two
received four points (Table 1).
Important baseline characteristics of the included
studies in the meta-analysis are presented in Table 1.
Seventeen studies investigated the association between
metformin use and OS for CRC patients [11-17, 19, 2230], whereas five [13, 14, 16, 22, 24] and three [19, 29, 31]
studies reported the CS and DFS, respectively. Three and
four studies contained survival data of exclusively colon
and rectal cancer, respectively. However, the majority
of the included studies involved both colon and rectal
cancer patients. Patients with a mixture of stage I-IV
disease was investigated in fourteen studies and four other
studies included stage II, IV or I-III cancer patients. The

Sensitivity analyses and publication bias

median follow-up period ranged from 26 months to more
than four years from the available follow-up information.
Age, gender, body mass index, and stage were four most
commonly investigated variables that were adjusted for
in Cox's proportional-hazard model evaluation of the
association between metformin intake and CRC mortality.

For OS subset, the funnelplot indicated asymmetry
and the presence of publication bias (Figure 3). The
hollow circles showed that three missing studies that lay
in the non-significant regions of the plot, suggesting that
asymmetry was attributed partly to publication bias, which
was further confirmed with Egger’s linear regression test
(P=0.037). The adjusted random effects pooled HR of
0.77 (95% CI, 0.67-0.87) calculated using the trim-andfill method remained constant with the original analysis.
We did not explore the publication bias for CS or DFS due
to the limited number of studies involved.

Metformin intake and CRC prognosis
Meta-analysis based on all observational studies
assessing CRC OS in patients with DM indicated that
compared with non-use, metformin use was significant
associated with decreased OS in patients with DM (HR
0.69, 95 % CI 0.61-0.77, Figure 2), with considerable
heterogeneity across studies (I2=73.5%). The analysis
of studies when involving prospective cohorts showed
similar results with low heterogeneity (HR 0.83, 95% CI
0.75-0.92, I2=0%).
Five studies reported the CRC prognosis for CS
and three for DFS; metformin intake was significantly
associated with patient CS (HR 0.75, 95% CI, 0.59-0.94),
but not DFS (HR 0.38, 95% CI, 0.13-1.17).

DISCUSSION
This meta-analysis based on patient survival data
from observational studies comparing metformin use and
non-use in patients with CRC revealed that metformin
intake was associated with better outcomes in terms of OS
and CS.
The significant association between metformin
intake and OS of patients was also noted in most baseline
subsets, further confirming the prognostic role of
metformin in CRC. However, the significant associations
were exhibited in only rectal cancer patients and stage II
and stage III patients, probably due to the limited number
of studies involved.
A significant heterogeneity (I2= 73.5%) of the
analysis was observed in this systematic review for OS.
In sensitivity analysis, exclusion of each of the studies in
turn did not largely alter the significance of the pooled
estimate. Subgroup analysis showed that the heterogeneity
significantly reduced for most investigated baseline
characteristics (Table 2), indicating that the source of interstudy heterogeneity may partly attribute to these variables.
Moreover, subgroup analysis indicated that metformin
intake was significantly correlated with improved OS for
CRC patients in stage II (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.57-0.93),
stage III tumors (HR 0.58 95% CI 0.37-0.92) and rectal
cancer (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.58-0.91), while not in other
stages or in colon cancer. As the influential factors and
characteristics of CRC in different locations and stages
might differ because of diverse molecular profiles and
epigenetic background of tumors, the prognosis of CRC
might vary among different tumor locations and stages.
However, though it did not reach statistical significance
for some subsets, the trends all indicated that patients with
metformin intake had favorable OS, probably due to the
limited sample size or statistical power involved. More
prospective and multicenter studies might further clarify
its real prognostic role in specific cancer profiles.
The finding that stage II/III CRC patients who
used metformin had more survial benefits than stage I/IV
patients, which was consistent with the findings of some
previously published studies [12, 14]. We proposed

Subgroup analyses
The effect of metformin use on patient OS appeared
to be smaller among studies investigating only colon
cancers (pooled HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67-1.03, three
studies, I2=0%) compared with studies including only
rectal cancers (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.91, four studies,
I2=41.4%, Table 2). However, we did not note statistically
significant difference between this subgroup (P for
interaction =0.40).
The prognostic effect of metformin intake on
patient OS was larger in studies that limited their analyses
in retrospective studies (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.54-0.74,
twelve studies, I2=78.8%) compared with the estimates
from studies that limited their analyses in prospective
studies (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, five studies, I2=0%).
Significant subgroup difference was observed (P for
interaction =0.004).
The prognostic effect of metformin intake was also
noted significantly large in the subgroup of patient origin
from hospital-based studies (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.70,
I2=72.8%; Table 2), compared with that from populationbased studies (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72-0.88, I2=49.4%, P
for interaction =0.005). Another possible interaction was
noted in subgroup of different number of centers involved
for OS (P for interaction =0.037).
Results of other subgroup analyses are presented in
Table 2, which showed that the prognostic effect remained
stable for patients with different research region, sample
size and NOS score. When the analyses were limited to
individual CRC tumor stage, we noted that statistical
prognistic effect was noted only in stage II and stage III
patients, but not in stage I and stage IV patients.

that some of the stage II and almost all of the stage III
patients would receive adjuvant chemotherapy, which
played an important role in the clinical outcomes of
these patients. Therefore, we suggested that metformin
had a potential synergic effect with other anti-cancer
agents and might be a candidate drug as an additional
therapy to adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II/III CRC
(locally advanced CRC). However, limited sample size

were included and caution should be taken when when
interpreting these results.
Several explanations for the potential association
between metformin intake and CRC patient survival
were proposed. It was reported that metformin enhanced
tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligandinduced apoptosis through the degradation of myeloid
cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) by the proteasome machinery
26454

[32]. Metformin has also an inhibitory effect on cell
proliferation mediated by suppression of mTOR and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/AKT pathways [33].
In addition, Langer et al.has found that metformin can
increase cell viability which was associated with reduced
apoptosis. This factor is also associated with increased
AMPK and Akt or reduced mTOR in a concentrationdependent manner, thus mediating pro-survival effects
after apoptosis-inducing high glucose stimulation [10].
Still, previous research has also suggested that the biologic
effects of metformin are mediated through reexpression
of miRNAs and decreased expression of cancer stem cellspecific genes, indicating that metformin is beneficial
for overcoming therapeutic resistance of certain cancer
cells [34].
For subset of OS, significant between-study
heterogeneity was noted (I2=73.5%, Pheterogeneity <0.001).
The result of sensitivity analyses showed that exclusion
any one of the study did not greatly change the pooled
estimate. The results of the trim-and-fill method and
subgroup analyses stratified by the major clinical variables
had the same trend with the main analyses, indicating the
robustness of our findings which were not influenced by
publication bias. However, still caution should be taken
when interpreting the findings, as publication bias is
unavoidable and the statistical analyses for publication
bias are not perfectly comprehensive.
Three previous meta-analyses have examined
metformin intake for predicting CRC patient survival
[20, 21, 35]. The first two meta-analyses by Mei et al and
Zhang et al found that CRC patients with type 2 DM who

took metformin had longer OS and CS based on six and
five cohort studies, respectively, which was reported again
by He et al in 2016. However, due to the limited number
of studies and small sample size, no sufficient statistical
power of these two systmatic reviews has been added, so
updated evidence is urgently needed for further clarify this
associations.
This meta-analysis is the most comprehensive
summary to provide robust statistical evidence for the
substantial prognostic impact of metformin intake in CRC
patients with type 2 DM. Despite the fact that several
recently published studies showed a positive association
between metformin and survival in CRC patients [11-15,
17, 19], the small sample size (ranging from 67 to 616)
could not provide sufficient statistical power to draw a
definite conclusion. These inconsistent findings could
result from several factors. Firstly, the included studies
had different study designs. Eight studies applied a
convenience sample from single centers while other nine
studies selected cases from multiple institutions. Nine
studies used population-based cohorts while eight used
hospital-based cohorts in epidemiologic settings. These
variations would inevitably invlolve in selection bias.
Secondly, the included studies covered a wide range of
sample sizes from 106 to 111673. We known that smaller
studies in a meta-analysis could show larger treatment
effects, leading to inaccurate estimates of effect sizes for
the investigated association, and publication bias are very
likely to occur. Asymmetry was clearly noted in the funnel
plot (Figure 3). However, we used the trim-and-fill model
for adjustment, and the result agreed with the primary

Figure 3: Contour enhanced funnel plot for meta-analysis of the association between metformin intake and overall
survival. The plots indicates that most studies were in the significant areas where P<0.01 and where 0.01<P<0.05, while few studies were
in the non-significant area (the blank area). Circles refer to included studies, and four missing studies (white circles) were filled.

analysis, suggesting the significant association between
metformin intake and CRC patient survival. Thirdly, the
included studies involved various disease characteristics
including tumor stage, location and other molecular
features, which were other sources of heterogeneity. Our
subgroup analyses have shown that metformin intake
was significantly associated with patient OS only in
stage II, stage III patients and rectal cancer patients, but
not in stage I, stage IV patients or colon cancer patients.
Nevertheless, these effects should be interpreted with
caution due to limited studies in each studies and lack of
sufficient statitical power. The findings of these subgroups
should be further validated from more large-scale cohorts.
Limitations of this systematic review should not
be ignored. Firstly, most of the studies did not have the
information of the molecular date concerning KRAS,
BRAF, PIK3CA mutation or microsatellite status, patient
information of each tumor stage, chemotherapy or
radiotherapy patient received, so sensitivity analyses could
not be performed based on these variables. Secondly, as
the included ones were all study-level studies, we could
not abstract more detailed information of each individual,
for example, duration and doses of metformin use, the
stage of diabetes, concentration of blood glucose, and
the amount of metformin intake for each people, etc, thus
some of the subgroup analyses we were interested in could
not be performed. Thirdly, the heterogeneity of statistical
analyses lies in the difference in the adjustment variables
among studies, which could have affected the accuracy
and precision of the combined estimates. Multivariate Cox
proportional hazards models were used in almost all of
the studies except two [13, 19] that did not directly report
survival estimates. We calculated the survival estimates
using the method provided by Parmar et al. [36], by which
uncertain bias, such as immortal time bias, for pooled
estimates could have occured. Recently, it has been
criticized that the effect of metformin on cancer survival
might be exaggerated due to immortal time bias. However,
some study showed that the presence of immortal time bias
would not change the direction of metformin's effect on
lung cancer [37]. We did sensitivity analysis by excluding
studies that did not used multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models and the direction of the result remained
unchanged. Fourthly, we did not search unpublished gray
literature, which could have led to publication bias.
Our study has several strengths. First, we thoroughly
searched the four major databases without language or
publication date limits, minimizing the risk of missing
publications which might cause publication bias. Second,
this meta-analysis is the largest and most comprehensive,
including the biggest sample size of over 269,000
individuals, providing the solidest evidence for this topic
currently. Third, we had done thorough stratified analysis
based on some of the major study characteristics, such as
the study design, participant features, follow-up period
and NOS scale for study quality, and the findings were
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

generally constant independent of some of the study
characteristics. Fourth, we selected and cross-checked
the identified studies, developed and abstracted the data,
rated the study quality at least by two to three independent
reviewers, minimizing the selection bias to the greatest
extent and more objectively performing the systematic
review.
In summary, our findings suggest that meformin
intake is associated with improved survival outcomes in
terms of OS and CS in CRC patients with DM, particular
for OS in stage II and stage III patients. Further studies
should be conducted to determine CRC survival between
metformin use and patient specific clinical and molecular
profiles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy
A literature search of the major databases including
PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library Central Register
of Controlled Trials and American Society of Clinical
Oncology (ASCO) databases from inception to July
2016 was performed for all relevant studies investigating
an association between metformin use and CRC
prognostic outcomes. Supplementary Table 2-5 present
the detailed search strategies using the following freetext words combined with Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) or EMTREE terms: “colorect*/colon*/rectum/
rectal”, “cancer*/tumor*/tumour*/carcinom*/neoplas* /
adenocarcinoma* /malignan*”, “metformin/biguanide*”,
and
“prognos*/survival/recurren*/mortality/predict*/
outcome*/death”. Manual reference search was also
conducted for recent citations in some of the high impact
journals such as Annals of Oncology, Diseases of the
Colon & Rectum and the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute. We also scrutinized for additional citations from
the references of primary selected studies, reviews or
meta-analyses which were not identified through database
search. We did not apply date or language restrictions to
our search strategy.

Study selection and inclusion criteria
Three reviewers (LD, MW and YK) independently
evaluated all the titles and abstracts identified through
the primary literature search, then selected and identified
all the potentially relevant citations retrieved for full text
reviews to assess for eligibility. Any disagreements were
resolved by consensus or by a senior reviewer (CB or ZC)
if necessary.
Observational studies were considered eligible for
inclusion if: (1) studies published with original data in
peer-review journals or published in style of abstracts
without language restrictions; (2) studies at least reporting
one of the survival outcomes, such as overall survival

(OS), cancer-specific survival (CS) and disease-free
survival (DFS); and (3) studies investigating the impact
of metformin intake in CRC patients and providing
prognostic data with a hazard ratio (HR) estimate and
its 95% confidence interval (CI) comparing survival
outcomes of metformin users with that of in non-users. We
excluded the following studies if: (1) studies containing
no prognostic data; (2) studies having no sufficient
information concerning prognostic parameters for
analysis; and (3) study type including letters, comments
or reviews without original data.
When duplicate publication suspected, we used
the study with the largest sample size or contacted the
corresponding authors and asked for clarification via
e-mail if possible.
A comprehensive data abstraction form for each
study containing the following baseline characteristics
were extracted: the first author name, study design,
research country, number of hospitals involved in the
research, number of patients taking metformin and not
taking metformin, the sample size of the full cohort,
tumor site, disease stage, source of data, median follow-up
duration, survival outcomes with their estimates (HRs with
corresponding 95% CIs) and adjusted variables.
We used the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)
[38] to evaluate study quality, which was a validated tool
for the assessment of the methodological quality of nonrandomized studies. Three domains including selection
of the participants, comparability of the participants and
outcomes were allocated to 9 points. We proposed a score
of more than 6 as high risk of bias.

Data analysis was synthesized using R software
version 3.1.2. and Stata® version 12.0 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, Texas, USA). We expressed time-to event
data as HRs with 95% CIs. Between-study heterogeneity
was tested using I2 statistic defined as an I2 value >50%
indicating substantial heterogeneity. As substantial
clinical, methodological, or statistical heterogeneity
among included studies, we pooled the data using a
random-effects model for the meta-analysis or using the
method reported by Parmar et al [36]. We investigated
the source of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses
by examining potential influencial variables that could
explain some of the heterogeneity. Differences between
subgroups were evaluated using the test of subgroup
differences described by Deeks et al [39]. Publication
bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot
symmetry combined with Begg's regression or Egger’s
linear regression method [40, 41], with a P value less than
0.05 indicating statistically significant. We also tested the
possible impact of publication bias through Duval’s nonparametric trim-and-fill method [42].
