BACKGROUND: Activating mutations in RAS are frequently present in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their overall
prognostic impact is not clear. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to establish the clinical characteristics of patients
with RAS-mutated (RASmut) AML, to analyze their outcome by therapy, and to describe the proteomic profile of RASmut compared
with wild-type RAS (RASWT) AML. RESULTS: Of 609 patients with newly diagnosed AML, 11% had RASmut. Compared with RASWT,
patients with RASmut AML were younger (median age, 54 years vs 63 years; P ¼.001), had a higher white blood cell count (16K mm3
vs 4K mm3 ; P < 0.001) and bone marrow blast percentage (56% vs 42%; P ¼.01) at diagnosis, and were less likely to have an antecedent hematologic disorder (36% vs 50%; P ¼.03). The inv(16 ) karyotype was overrepresented in patients with RASmut and the 5
and/or 7 karyotype was underrepresented. RAS mutations were found to have no prognostic impact on overall survival or diseasefree survival overall or within cytogenetic subgroups. There was a suggestion that patients with RASmut benefited from cytarabine
(AraC)-based therapy. Proteomic analysis revealed simultaneous upregulation of the RAS-Raf-MAP kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways in patients with RASmut. CONCLUSIONS: RAS mutations in AML may delineate a subset of patients
who benefit from AraC-based therapy and who may be amenable to treatment with inhibitors of RAS and PI3K signaling pathways.

INTRODUCTION
Activating mutations in the RAS protooncogene are among the most common genetic alterations in human cancer.1–3 They
are present overall in approximately 40% of all malignancies, and noted in up to 90% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 30% of
non-small cell lung cancer, and approximately one-third of colorectal cancers.1,2 Several series have reported RAS mutations
in 10% to 25% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)4–14 and 7% to 48% of cases of myelodysplastic syndrome.15–17
N-RAS, K-RAS, and H-RAS are the most common isoforms of RAS involved in human cancer. The activating point mutations most frequently occur in codons 12, 13, or 61, although less common point mutations also have been described.2,18
RAS is a guanosine-50 -triphosphate (GTP)-dependent second messenger protein that couples signals from receptor tyrosine
kinases, cytokine receptors, and growth factor receptors to intracellular signaling networks to induce proliferation and survival (Fig. 1).2,3,19,20 Under normal conditions, an upstream activation signal promotes the binding of GTP to RAS, facilitated by GTP exchange factors. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of downstream Raf, Mek, and the mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK can then translocate to the nucleus and
modulate transcription.2,20 This process is self-regulated by the GTPase activity associated with RAS, which hydrolyzes the
GTP and turns the signal off. Oncogenic mutations of RAS that disrupt this GTPase activity lead to aberrant constitutive signaling that is independent of the upstream stimuli.2,3,19,20 There is also important crosstalk between the RAS-Mek-MAP kinase pathway and other growth and survival pathways such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway (Fig. 1). In
malignancies in which the RAS pathway is constitutively active due to mutations, it is important to recognize that additional
associated pathways such as the PI3K-Akt axis may provide redundant growth and survival signals. An important mechanism
of resistance to the therapeutic targeting of RAS is crosstalk and signaling through alternate pathways.20 Determining the activation status of proteins downstream from RAS and PI3K in samples from patients with AML with mutated RAS (RASmut)
versus wild-type RAS (RASWT) could potentially yield additional therapeutic targets and mechanisms of resistance.
The impact of RAS mutations on outcome and response to therapy in various cancers is currently under extensive
investigation.11,21,22 Recent work has shown that RAS mutations in patients with AML may be predictive of a benefit

from postremission therapy with high-dose cytarabine
(AraC).11 However, the overall prognostic impact of RAS
mutations in patients with AML is not clear. Although
some investigators reported that RAS mutations were associated with an adverse outcome,9,14,17 others have suggested a favorable impact,7,10 and several have noted no
significant prognostic impact.4,6,12,13 In the current
study, we attempted to further characterize the role of
RAS mutations in patients with AML. We analyzed the
baseline characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed
AML with RASmut or RASWT and evaluated their response
to different therapies and their overall outcome. We also
examined their pretreatment proteomic profiles to determine any differences in the 2 cohorts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group

The records of patients with newly diagnosed AML who
were seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2003 and 2007 were analyzed. This
included 609 patients in whom RAS mutational analysis
was performed at the time of diagnosis. A total of 228
patients, who were representative of the entire group, had
banked material for proteomic analysis. All patients
underwent a bone marrow examination at diagnosis.
Informed consent was appropriately obtained from all
patients, according to the institutional guidelines and in
compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (local protCancer

Bone marrow cytogenetics were performed by conventional chromosomal banding and/or fluorescence in situ
hybridization when needed. The cytogenetics were classified into 3 prognostic subgroups: favorable ( t(8;21),
inv(16), t(16;16), or t(15;17) ), adverse ( 5, 7, 11q23
abnormality, or complex karyotype [3 cytogenetic
abnormalities] ), or intermediate (neither adverse nor
favorable).
RAS mutation analysis was performed on unsorted
cells from diagnostic bone marrow aspirate samples (with
a median blast percentage of 44) for exon 1 (codons 12
and 13) and exon 2 (codon 61) for both N-RAS and KRAS using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA
sequencing methods. FLT3(fms-related tyrosine kinase 3)
mutation analysis was performed on the same samples
using PCR-based DNA sequencing methods.
Reverse Phase Protein Array

Proteomic analysis of matched, banked pretreatment
patient blood or bone marrow samples was performed
using an automated, high-throughput reverse phase protein array as previously described.24,25 Briefly, protein
lysates from patient samples were printed onto methylcellulose-coated slides in 5 serial dilutions along with normalization and expression controls. Each slide was probed
with a distinct validated antihuman antibody for the protein or phosphoprotein in question and a secondary antibody to amplify the signal. Finally, a stable dye was
precipitated.26 The stained slides were analyzed using
MicroVigene software (Vigene Tech, Carlisle, Mass) to
produce quantified data. A total of 176 validated antibodies were used. Supercurve algorithms were used to generate a single value from the 5 serial dilutions.27 Loading
control28 and topographical normalization procedures
accounted for protein concentration and background
staining variations. Associations between protein expression levels and RAS mutation status were assessed in R
using standard Student t tests.
Treatment

Patients received several different treatment regimens
depending on the available clinical trials as well as their
age and performance status. For the purposes of this analysis, induction therapy could be divided into 3 groups: 1)
a high-dose AraC-based regimen ( 1000 mg/m2/day
[HiAraC]), 2) a conventional dose AraC-based regimen
5551

Original Article

(100 mg/m2/day to 500 mg/m2/day [ConvAraC]), and 3)
a non-AraC–based regimen (non-AraC). Treatments
within the non-AraC cohort included hypomethylating
agents (azacitidine, decitabine), other nucleoside analogues such as clofarabine, and small-molecule targeted
therapies, among others (Table 1).

Criteria for Response and Definitions

Complete remission (CR) was defined by the presence of
< 5% blasts in the bone marrow, the absence of extramedullary leukemia, and peripheral blood count recovery
with a neutrophil count of at least 1  109/L and a platelet
count of at least 100  109/L.29 Treatment failure was
defined by the absence of a documented CR after therapy,
including induction death or refractory disease. Disease
recurrence was defined by an excess of 10% leukemic
blasts in a bone marrow aspirate that was not related to
normal hematopoietic recovery or the development of
new extramedullary leukemia. Disease-free survival was
calculated from the time of first documented CR to disease recurrence or death in CR. The duration of CR

(CRd) was calculated from the time of first documented
CR to disease recurrence. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the time of diagnosis of AML to death from
any cause.
Statistical Analysis

Patient and disease characteristics were compared using
chi-square tests. These characteristics are listed in Table 2
and include age, sex, white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, beta2-microglobulin level, blast percentage,
French-American-British (FAB) morphology, cytogenetic
category, FLT3- internal tandem duplication (ITD) positivity, and history of antecedent hematologic disorder
(AHD). Estimates of survival curves and CRd were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier product limit
method and compared by means of the log-rank test. The
Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to
assess the relation between patient characteristics and survival. Predictive variables with P < .1 by univariate analysis were included in a multivariate analysis. All reported P
values were 2-sided, and those < .05 were considered statistically significant. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted assessing complete response to
treatment as a dichotomous variable (response vs no
response). Independent predictors included in the model
were adverse cytogenetics, AHD, RAS mutation, performance status, use of AraC therapy, and diagnosis of
therapy-related AML. Two-way interactions between the
variables in the model were explored and reported and the
model goodness of fit was verified using the HosmerLemeshow chi-square test. We used a P < .05 as the level
of statistical significance. The statistical analyses were
accomplished using IBM SPSS statistical software for
Windows (version 19.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

From January 2003 to December 2007, 609 patients with
newly diagnosed AML were identified in whom RAS
mutational analysis was performed. Of these, 66 patients
(11%) were found to have RAS mutations: 48 (73%) with
an N-RAS mutation, 16 (24%) with a K-RAS mutation,
and 2 patients with both. Patient characteristics of the
RASmut cohort and the RASWT cohort are summarized in
Table 2. The median age for patients with RASmut was 54
years versus 63 years for those with RASWT (P ¼ .001). In
addition, patients with RASmut had a significantly higher
WBC count (median, 16K/mm3 vs 4K/mm3; P < .001),
peripheral blast percentage (median, 22% vs 10%;
P ¼ .007), bone marrow blast percentage (median, 56%

vs 42%; P ¼ .01), and beta2-microglobulin (median, 3.6
vs 2.7; P ¼ .002) at diagnosis. Patients with RASmut were
less likely than those in the wild-type cohort to have a history of AHD (36% vs 50%; P ¼ .03). A higher percentage
of patients in the wild-type cohort had FLT3-ITD, but
this did not reach statistical significance. The prevalence
of AML with RASmut among patients with different FAB
morphologic subtypes and different karyotypes is
depicted in Figure 2. There was a significantly higher
prevalence of RASmut among patients with FAB M4 (acute
myleomonocytic leukemia; 24% [P < .001]) and M5
(acute monocytic leukemia; 23% [P ¼ .004]) histologies.
RAS mutations were significantly overrepresented in
inv(16), having been found in 39% of patients with this
karyotype (P < .001). Conversely, RAS mutations were
significantly underrepresented in the 5/-7 and t(15;17)
karyotypes (P ¼ .03).
Outcome

This cohort of patients with newly diagnosed AML was
treated with a variety of different therapies according to
their age, performance status, karyotype, and the availability of specific clinical trials (Table 1). Because these are

among the covariates determined to be important in predicting outcome in patients with AML, we first performed
a multivariate analysis of predictive factors for the achievement of CR (Table 3). Independent predictors of the
achievement of CR in the entire cohort were age, cytogenetics, history of AHD, and treatment with AraC-based
therapy. Notably, the presence of a RAS mutation and
performance status were not found to be significant. We
then analyzed the OS and CRd for the entire cohort of
patients by RAS mutation status, regardless of treatment
or cytogenetics. There was no significant difference in OS
or CRd between patients with AML with RASmut or
RASWT (Fig. 3). Among patients with the inv(16) karyotype, there was no significant difference noted in OS or
CRd between patients with RASmut or RASWT (Fig. 4
Top). Among patients with an intermediate-risk karyotype, there was no significant difference in OS or CRd
between those patients with RASmut or RASWT (Fig. 4
Middle). In patients with an adverse risk karyotype, there
was a trend toward worse OS and CRd in patients with
RASmut, but this did not reach statistical significance (Fig.
4 Bottom). Among patients with RASmut, there was no
significant difference in OS between those who had an NRAS versus K-RAS mutation (median, 12.9 months vs
14.5 months; P ¼ .78) (Fig. 5). Similarly, there was no
significant difference in the CR rate between patients with
N-RAS or K-RAS (56% vs 63%; P ¼ .66)
The response rates by treatment in the 66 patients
with RASmut are outlined in Table 4 and compared with
patients with RASWT. There was a significantly higher rate
of CR in patients who received any AraC versus those who
received no AraC (70%, 70%, and 0%, respectively, for
HiAraC, ConvAraC, and nonAraC; P < .001). Because
clinical factors such as age and history of AHD may influence the decision to treat patients with AraC-based or
non–AraC-based therapy, we next examined the outcome
of patients with RASmut by age (< 60 years vs  60 years),

a diagnosis of secondary AML (vs primary or de novo
AML), and whether they had received AraC-based therapy.(Fig. 6) All of the 39 patients aged < 60 years in this
cohort received AraC-based therapy and had the best outcome (median OS, 23.5 months). Among the older
patients with RASmut, those who received AraC had a significantly improved OS compared with those who did not
(median OS, 12 months vs 2.5 months). When the
patients were analyzed by their diagnosis of primary versus
secondary AML, those patients who had primary AML
and received AraC-based therapy had the longest OS (median, 26.5 months), compared with those who had either
secondary AML (treated with or without AraC) or those
who had primary AML and were treated with non–AraCbased therapy. Indeed, on multivariate analysis, the factors
that were found to independently predict OS in patients
with RASmut were adverse cytogenetics (P ¼ .016) and a
history of AHD (P ¼ .001). (Table 5).
Proteomic Analysis

Of the 609 cases analyzed, 228 patients (37%) had

using a panel of 176 validated antibodies. Of the 176 proteins tested, 39 (22%) were differentially expressed
between baseline AML samples with RASWT and RASmut
(Table 7). With a false discovery rate of 5%, the expectation would be to find 8.8 proteins being significantly different, and therefore this frequency was significantly
higher than expected. Twenty proteins were expressed at
relatively higher levels in samples with RASmut and 19
were relatively higher in samples with RASWT (Table 7).
Among the proteins that were expressed at relatively
higher levels in samples with RASmut were a substantial
number of downstream targets and effectors of both the

DISCUSSION
To further characterize the significance of RASmut in
patients with newly diagnosed AML, we performed a retrospective, single-institution, clinical and proteomic analysis on a large cohort of patients who were treated
heterogeneously. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients, to analyze the effect of different treatments on outcome, to assess the prognostic
impact of RASmut in AML, and to examine the differential
protein expression in the leukemic cells of patients with

RASmut and RASWT. We found several pretreatment clinical characteristics that were significantly different between
patients with RASmut and RASWT. Patients with RASmut
in the study cohort tended to be younger than those with
RASWT and less likely to have AHD. Similar to other
reported series,9,13 patients with RASmut had a higher median WBC count at the time of presentation. However, in
contrast with other reports,10,11,13 the current study indicated that patients with RASmut had higher peripheral
blood and bone marrow blast percentages at presentation.
Confirming observations from other large studies of
patients with AML, RAS mutations were significantly
overrepresented in patients with the inv(16) karyotype
and underrepresented in patients with t(15;17) and 5/-7
karyotypes.4,6 This strong association with inv(16) suggests a cooperative interaction between the 2 genetic
abnormalities. Activation of the RAS pathway in patients
with inv(16) may be an important mechanism of pathogenesis and should also be investigated further in patients
with inv(16) without RAS mutations for other routes of
pathway activation. If this signaling pathway is indeed
mechanistically important in patients with inv(16) AML,

then targeting this pathway could offer therapeutic opportunities. Conversely, one explanation for the relative
underrepresentation of RAS mutations in patients with
t(15;17) could be the presence of alternate genetic abnormalities that can activate constitutive signaling through
the RAS-MAPK and related pathways. For example,
FLT3-ITD mutations, which are present in approximately 40% of cases30–32 with t(15;17), are upstream of
and exploit the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Indeed, we and others6,9,13 have shown that RAS
mutations and FLT-ITD rarely coexist in the same patient
with AML. This suggests deregulation of common final
signaling pathways resulting from different aberrantly
activated upstream molecules.19 If this is confirmed, specifically inhibiting a limited number of signaling pathways could be broadly applicable in patients with AML.
In the current study, RASmut had no clear prognostic
significance in AML overall or within the different cytogenetic subgroups in terms of OS or duration of remission.
This is in keeping with the majority of other large series.4,6,12 Because the cohort in the current study had been
treated with a variety of different therapies, we were able
to assess the effect of various doses of AraC and nonAraC
on outcome in patients with RASmut. Recently, investigators from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B reported
that patients with AML with RASmut derived greater benefit from postremission therapy with high-dose AraC compared with those with RASWT and those who did not
receive HiDAC consolidation.11 These clinical data confirmed previous in vitro work by Koo et al33,34 that demonstrated that RASmut AML cell lines were more sensitive
to the cytotoxic effects of AraC than those with RASWT.
The investigators demonstrated that cells harboring the
RAS mutation had a compromised S-phase checkpoint in
response to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage.33
Unlike cells with RASWT, which arrested in S-phase in
response to AraC, cells with RASmut progressed through
the S-phase, incorporating AraC and continuing on to apoptosis.33 This led to a cytotoxic response versus a cytostatic response to AraC. Clinical results from the current
study support both the preclinical and previous clinical
observations highlighting the sensitivity of RASmut AML
to AraC.8,11,33,34
All patients in the current study who received any
AraC as part of their induction therapy received HiDAC
as their consolidation therapy. Patients with RASmut who
were not treated with AraC had a lower CR rate and
shorter OS than those who received AraC as part of their
induction therapy. This difference in OS was also
observed in the subgroup of older patients with RASmut,
5557

and, although not statistically significant, in those with
AHD and RASmut. It is interesting to note that patients
with RASmut and a history of AHD had the poorest OS,
regardless of their therapy. On multivariate analysis, the
only factors that were found to be associated with OS in
patients with RASmut were a history of AHD and cytogenetics. This may suggest a degree of selection bias in the
current study cohort, because older patients or those with
a predetermined adverse prognosis who were not able to
tolerate intense chemotherapy were offered clinical trials
not containing AraC, thereby accounting for the diminished effect of treatment on the overall prognosis noted on
multivariate analysis.
Exploring the differential protein expression signature of patients with RASmut AML may give provide
insight into the drivers of this disease and potentially highlight new therapeutic targets in this patient subset. Using
a high-throughput proteomics array, we were able to compare the pretreatment protein expression signature from
samples of patients with AML and RASmut compared with
those with RASWT. We found a significant number of
proteins that were expressed differentially between AML
samples containing RASmut and RASWT. As hypothesized,
several downstream targets and effectors of the RAS-RafMAP kinase pathway as well as the PI3K-Akt pathway
were expressed at relatively higher levels in samples with
RASmut. Although this needs to be validated further, this
finding suggests a greater activation of both signaling
pathways in patients with RASmut AML, compared with
RASWT AML, with the implication that they may respond
to small molecule inhibitors of kinases along these pathways. Illmer et al8 conducted a similar investigation on
the activation status of the RAS pathway in patients with
AML. Using Western blot analysis to detect activated RAS
(as defined by Raf-bound RAS), the investigators found
an activated RAS pathway in approximately 25% of all
AML cases. It is interesting to note that only 22% of the
RAS-mutated cases were found to have increased RAS activity using their method. However, the study did not
simultaneously examine the activation of associated signaling pathways such as the PI3K-Akt pathway, which
may have been relatively upregulated in the AML samples
with RASmut. To our knowledge, the current study is the
first to simultaneously assess the activation status of protein signaling networks in patients with AML and
RASmut.
In conclusion, we found that AML with RASmut has
distinct clinical features and an association with certain
cytogenetic and morphologic subgroups. Although we
did not find a prognostic effect of RAS mutations overall
5558

in patients with AML, we did find an interaction between
AraC-based treatment or a history of AHD and overall
outcome. Comparative proteomic profiling of RASmut
AML suggests upregulation and activation of proteins
involved in the RAS-Raf-MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling
networks that are relatively higher than in AML without
RASmut. This may form the basis of future studies investigating the use of specific inhibitors and their combinations in this subset of patients.
