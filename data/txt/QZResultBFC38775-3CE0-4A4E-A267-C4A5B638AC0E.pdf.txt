RET Gene Mutations (Genotype and Phenotype) of
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 and
Familial Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
Geoffrey W. Krampitz, MD; and Jeffrey A. Norton, MD

The rapid technical advances in molecular biology and accelerating improvements in genomic and proteomic diagnostics have led to
increasingly personalized strategies for cancer therapy. Such an approach integrates the genomic, proteomic, and molecular information unique to the individual to provide an accurate genetic diagnosis, molecular risk assessment, informed family counseling, therapeutic profiling, and early preventative management that best fits the particular needs of each patient. The discovery of mutations in
the RET proto-oncogene resulting in variable onset and severity of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) was the first step in
developing direct genetic testing for at-risk individuals. Patients with germline RET mutations may undergo risk assessment and
appropriate intervention based on specific mutations. Moreover, family members of affected individuals receive counseling based on
understanding of the genetic transmission of the disease. Increasingly, clinicians are able to make therapeutic choices guided by an
informative biomarker code. Improvements in detection and management of patients with MEN2 resulting from understanding of the
RET proto-oncogene are evidence of the benefits of personalized cancer medicine. This review describes the discovery of the RET
proto-oncogene, the association between genotype and phenotype, and the role of mutation analysis on diagnosis and treatment of

INTRODUCTION
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome caused by missense mutations
in the RET proto-oncogene with different penetrance producing 3 variants, MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary
thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). MEN2 is a rare syndrome with an incidence of 1 in 200,000 live births. The principal feature
of all MEN2 subtypes is medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a cancer of the parafollicular (C, or calcitonin-secreting)
cells. Patients with MEN2 have a 70% to 100% risk of developing MTC by age 70 years, and MTC is the most important
determinant of mortality in these patients. MTC has a poor prognosis once it has spread beyond the thyroid. However,
patient survival is greatly improved when MTC is treated early in the course of the disease. Therefore, much of the emphasis of treating patients with MEN2 has focused on identifying and treating MTC.1 As such, recognition of at-risk patients,
early diagnosis, genetic risk stratification, timely surveillance, and appropriate treatment are crucial. Identifying mutations
in the RET proto-oncogene as the causative factor in MEN2 has led to the development of direct genetic testing for at-risk
individuals. Patients with germline RET mutations may undergo risk assessment based on particular mutations and may
be offered thyroidectomy prior to developing clinically evident MTC or early in the course of the disease when cancer is
limited to the thyroid gland. Family members may also receive counseling based on understanding of the genetic transmission of the disease. The initial discovery of the RET proto-oncogene as the causative factor in MEN2 was the first step in
establishing the highly personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of MEN2.
MEN2

John Sipple recognized the hereditary nature of the syndrome in 1961. However, the first description of pheochromocytoma by Felix Frankle in 1886 may be the initial account of a patient with MEN2. The descendants of the patient, who
had a bilateral pheochromocytoma, were later genotyped and found to have the C634R (Cys634Arg) RET mutation.2,3
The first description of MEN2A was by Alton Steiner and his colleagues in 1968.4 In 1980, Glen W. Sizemore recognized

that MEN2 was composed of 2 variants that he called
MEN2A and MEN2B.5 Common features of the 2
groups are multicentric MTC, occurring in > 90% of
patients, and bilateral pheochromocytomas, occurring in
50% of patients.6 In 1986, Farndon working with Samuel
Wells described FMTC, a third variant containing only
MTC. The characteristics of the MEN2 subtypes are summarized in Table 1.
MEN2A is the most common manifestation of
MEN2, accounting for the majority of cases. MTC is often the first manifestation of MEN2A, usually occurring
between the ages of 20 and 30 years. MEN2A is characterized by MTC and pheochromocytoma plus primary hyperparathyroidism, manifesting in 20% to 30% of
patients.1 In contrast to MEN2B, patients with MEN2A
have a normal physical appearance.
MEN2B is the most rare of the variants, accounting
for approximately 5% to 10% of all cases. MEN2B is
marked by earlier onset of disease compared to other
forms of MEN2. Usually MTC develops within the first
year of life, and the clinical course is usually more aggressive due to more advanced disease at presentation.7
Approximately 40% to 50% of patients with MEN2B
have pheochromocytoma. MEN2B lacks parathyroid pathology, but instead features Marfanoid habitus, mesodermal abnormalities, labial and mucosal neuromas, and
intestinal ganglioneuromas, often leading to constipation
and megacolon.1,5,6,8 It was soon recognized that the
MTC in MEN2B was the most aggressive from of hereditary MTC, characterized by rapid spread to regional and
distant sites and early mortality.7
FMTC is the mildest subtype and features MTC
without any of the extrathyroid characteristics of the other
MEN 2 subtypes.9 FMTC, as it was originally described,
is uncommon. Although some studies attribute up to
35% of MEN2 cases to FMTC, most families thought to

have FMTC become MEN2A families when an isolated
member develops either a pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism. Nevertheless, the term FMTC is now
commonly used to describe families who have hereditary
MTC with a rare patient having one of the other
endocrinopathies.
Discovery of RET

In 1985, Masahide Takahashi transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells with sonicated human lymphoma DNA segments, which resulted in transformation of these cells.
Subsequent cloning and homology analysis suggested that
the new transforming gene was unlike previously identified transforming genes. Using blot hybridization analysis, Takahashi determined that the transforming sequence
encompassed 34 kilobases and represented a rearrangement of 2 unlinked human DNA segments. Molecular
cloning indicated that the biologically active gene was
generated by recombination of 2 separate normal DNA
segments. Northern blot analysis indicated that the new
gene produced a new transcriptional unit. Because the
new transforming gene was the product of gene rearrangement during transfection of 3T3 fibroblasts, the gene was
named “REarranged during Transfection,” or RET.10
RET Proto-Oncogene

The proto-oncogene RET is composed of 21 exons
located on chromosome 10 (10q11.2) and encodes for a
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase for members of
the glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor family
(GDNF) and associated ligands (artemin, neuturin, persephin) (Fig. 1A).11-14 The RET protein is composed of 3
functional domains, including an extracellular ligandbinding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain (Fig. 1B). The extracellular domain contains 4 cadherin-like repeats and a
cysteine-rich region. The highly conserved cysteine-rich
region is important for disulfide bond formation needed
for maintaining the native tertiary structure allowing for
receptor dimerization. The intracellular domain contains
2 tyrosine kinase subdomains that are involved in several
intracellular signal transduction pathways.15 Coupling
RET, its coreceptors, GDNF-family receptor alpha
(GFRa1 to GFRa4),16 and GDNF-family ligands leads
to RET dimerization to form a heterohexamer complex
that results in transcellular kinase activation and signaling.
RET is involved in a number of cellular signaling
pathways during development regulating the survival,
proliferation, differentiation, and migration of the enteric
nervous system progenitor cells, as well as the survival and

agenesis or severe dysgenesis and lack enteric neurons
throughout the digestive tract, suggesting that RET is a
component of a signaling pathway required for renal
organogenesis and enteric neurogenesis.25,26 Subsequently, inactivating mutations in RET associated with
Hirschprung’s disease27-32 and renal agenesis were
identified.25,26,33-37

Mutations in RET Cause MEN2

In 1987, genetic linkage analysis mapped the MEN2A
locus to a region on chromosome 10.38,39 In subsequent
years, the location of the MEN2A locus was further
refined. In 1990, Massimo Santoro found increased
expression of the RET gene in both familial and sporadic
human pheochromocytomas and MTC. Because the RET
gene was mapped to a location on chromosome 10 in
close proximity to the gene that predisposes patients to

the MEN2A syndrome, he suggested that this region of
chromosome 10 might be involved in the proliferation
and differentiation of neuroectodermal tissues.40 Wells
knew that even pentagastrin- and calcium-stimulated serum levels of calcitonin failed to reliably diagnose patients
with curable familial forms of MTC, so he decided to try
to identify the exact gene defect responsible for these syndromes. Furthermore, he realized that family members
without the inherited mutation could be told that they
did not have the syndrome and that they would not need
serial screening as had been done with the pentagastrinstimulated calcitonin levels. In 1993, Helen Donis-Keller,
working with Wells, identified 7 RET mutations in exons
7 and 8 associated with MEN2A and FMTC. They
screened a panel of genomic DNA from 7 MEN2A,
MEN2B, and FMTC families and normal controls. Using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis
approaches, a total of 7 single-strand conformational variants (SSCVs) were observed in MEN2 families and not
in DNA from normal individuals. Six of these were identified in exon 7 and 1 in exon 8, and all mutations affected
codons specifying cysteine residues. SSCVs present in
germline DNA were also found in MTC and pheochromocytoma from familial cases. However, these mutations
were not found in 3 families with MEN2A, suggesting
that these were not the only mutations responsible for
MEN2.41
Almost simultaneously, Lois Mulligan working with
Bruce Ponder generated complementary DNA from 4
MTCs and 3 pheochromocytomas from patients with
MEN2A and sporadic tumors. Using chemical cleavage
mismatch procedures and sequencing, they identified specific missense mutations in the RET gene at codons
encoding for cysteine residues within the transition point
between the extracellular and transmembrane domains.
These mutations were found in 20 of 23 apparently distinct MEN2A families, but not in 23 normal controls.
Furthermore, 19 of these 20 mutations affected the same
conserved cysteine residue at the boundary of the RET
extracellular and transmembrane domains.42 Subsequently, Robert Hofstra showed that MEN2B is associated with a T644M (Thr644Met) mutation affecting the
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the RET protein.
Using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, he found a variant pattern in all 9 unrelated MEN2B
patients and 6 of 18 sporadic MTC patients in his
cohort.43 At the same time, Kerri Carlson working with
Helen Donis-Keller found a single missense T918M
(Thr918Met) mutation in the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain of the RET proto-oncogene associated with

MEN2B. They performed sequence analysis of germline
DNA from 34 unrelated MEN2B patients that revealed
the mutation not found in 93 unaffected individuals,
including the normal parents of 14 de novo MEN2B
patients.44 In 1995, Santoro demonstrated the RET
mutations responsible for MEN2A and MEN2B acted by
constitutively activating the kinase, rather than through a
loss of tumor suppression. By transfecting fibroblast cells
with engineered vectors containing different RET mutations in the extracellular domain responsible for MEN2A
and FMTC (C634Y, C634A, C634W) and MEN2B
(M918T) he was able to demonstrate the increased RET
kinase activity and transforming efficiency. MEN2A
mutations altered the disulfide bond between receptor
monomers, creating an activating homodimer. On the
other hand, the MEN2B mutation altered the substrate
specificity for the receptor.45
Of the cases with MTC, 75% are sporadic and 25%
are familial. Virtually all patients with hereditary MTC
have germline RET mutations, whereas up to 75% of
patients with sporadic MTC have somatic RET mutations, the presence of which appears to be associated with
a more aggressive clinical phenotype compared to RETnegative sporadic patients.46 However, approximately 2%
to 5% of MEN2 families do not have RET mutations,
and many cases of sporadic MTC do not carry RET mutations.47,48 The absence of RET mutations suggests the existence of additional loci predisposing to MEN2 and
sporadic MTC. Other genes, including those encoding
components of the retinoblastoma (RB) and P53 tumorsuppressor pathways and RAS proto-oncogene may be
involved in MTC formation.49-54 Moreover, work done
in transgenic mouse models of MTC suggest that even in
the setting of RET mutations, secondary genetic alterations are required for development of MTC.55,56 Furthermore, C-cell hyperplasia is associated with MTC in
inherited MEN2 syndromes. Germline mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunit D have been found in families with C-cell hyperplasia without MTC.57 These
patients with familial C-cell hyperplasia may conceivably
be misdiagnosed as having FMTC and may account for
cases attributed to FMTC in absence of RET
mutations.58
Biochemical Diagnosis

The hormone calcitonin was discovered by Douglas Harold Copp in 1962,59 and it was subsequently shown by
Hirsch and Munson that the hormone was secreted by the
thyroid gland.60 The group of Armen Tashjian Jr studied
a large kindred of MEN2A patients and discovered that

the thyroid C-cells secreted calcitonin and that a calcium
infusion stimulated release of calcitonin. This was an
excellent provocative test for the early diagnosis of MTC.
Tashjian’s group developed the first radioimmunoassay
for calcitonin and performed early thyroidectomy based
on detection of elevated serum calcitonin levels in family
members at risk for MEN2A.61
Wells studied several kindreds with MEN2A and
realized that most of the elders in the families died of metastatic MTC. In 1975, his group worked on a method for
the early diagnosis of MTC so that family members who
had inherited a mutated RET allele could be identified
and possibly cured by early thyroidectomy. Studies in pigs
showed that a combined infusion of calcium and pentagastrin was the most potent provocative test for calcitonin
release.62 Wells and colleagues applied this method clinically and measured serum calcitonin levels after provocative testing. In some patients thyroidectomy and central
lymph node dissection was curative, however, in others
stimulated serum calcitonin levels were elevated postoperatively, indicating residual disease. Because provocative
testing could not identify patients prior to onset of disease, methods to prospectively select at-risk patients and
subsequently tailor appropriate treatment strategies were
needed.
Genetic Testing and Risk Stratification

Since the identification of mutations in the RET gene as
the causative agents in MEN2, genetic tests have been
developed and refined to clinically detect these defects.6366
Chi and Wells were the first to develop predictive testing for MEN2 based on genetic mutations in the RET
proto-oncogene. They extracted genomic DNA from 96
members of a MEN2A kindred and PCR-amplified
known RET mutations resulting in new restriction endonuclease sites. These new sites could then be detected by
digestion with the appropriate enzyme. They then verified
the inheritance of the mutation with a previously established genetic linkage test. They found that mutations
1924

vary among kindreds but are consistently inherited within
kindreds. In addition, they determined that their new
direct genetic analysis supplanted an established linkagebased test, because the latter was precluded by recombination events and required the selection of informative
genetic markers. The group was able to detect 43 mutations in the 43 affected individuals, thus establishing an
invariable correlation between mutation and disease.
Importantly, their test identified 2 genetically affected
individuals who were presymptomatic. Thus, the new
direct genetic analysis offered a predictive diagnostic test
for the disorder.
Today, genetic testing detects nearly 100% of mutation carriers and is considered the standard of care for all
first-degree relatives of patients with newly diagnosed hereditary MTC. However, due to the varying clinical
effects of RET mutations, strategies based on clinical phenotype, age of onset, and aggressiveness of MTC were
needed to guide therapy. The first classification system
was put forth after the Seventh International Workshop
on MEN in 2001, which provided guidelines for the age
of genetic testing and prophylactic thyroidectomy.67 This
stratification was revised when the American Thyroid
Association (ATA) convened a panel of experts in 2009 to
create evidence-based guidelines to assist in the clinical
care of patients with MTC. Recommendations on the
diagnostic workup and timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery are based on a classification
into 4 risk levels utilizing the genotype-phenotype correlation.68 The ATA classified mutations according to the
risk of developing early, aggressive MTC from A to D in
increasing levels, and made diagnostic and treatment
recommendations based on patient risk stratification
(Table 2).69 In 2010, the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society published consensus guidelines for
the diagnosis and management of MTC.70 These guidelines were developed by classifying RET mutations into 3
groups based on aggressiveness of MTC or level of risk
(Table 3). Level 1 RET mutations (codons 609, 768s,

790, 791, 804, and 891) are the lowest risk for aggressive
MTC marked by later onset of tumor development and a
more indolent biological course. Patients with Level 1
mutations rarely develop tumors before the age of 10 years
of age. However, because of variability in tumor onset in
some families with these mutations and because thyroidectomy can be curative if performed early, many experts
advocate performing a prophylactic operation by age 5
years whenever possible. Level 2 RET mutations (codons
611, 618, 620, and 634 mutations) are considered high
risk for aggressive MTC. Patients with level 2 RET mutations should undergo thyroidectomy before age 5 years.
Level 3 RET mutations (codons 883, 918, and 922) are
the most aggressive of all the RET mutations. Patients
with Level 3 mutations can have metastasis in the first
years of life.71 Consequently, thyroidectomy is recommended within the first 6 months and preferably within
the first month of life.
Genotype and Phenotype

Since the initial discovery of RET mutations responsible
for MEN2, as many as 50 different point mutations across
7 exons (exons 8, 10, 11, 13-16) have been identified (Fig.
1C and Table 4).72 Different mutations in the RET gene
produce varying phenotypes for the disease, including age
of onset and aggressiveness of MTC, and the presence or
absence of other endocrine neoplasms, such as pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism (Fig. 1D and Table
4). Approximately 85% of patients with MEN2 have a
mutation of exon 11 codon 634, whereas mutations in codons 609, 611, 618, and 620 account for 10% to 15% of
Cancer

cases.68 Particularly early aggressive behavior and metastasis in MEN2A and MEN2B are associated with C634 and
M918T mutations, respectively, requiring early intervention.22 On the other hand, A883F mutation displays a
more indolent form of MTC compared with a M918T
mutation for MEN2B.73 In addition, polymorphism at
codon 836 is associated with early metastases in patients
with hereditary or sporadic MTC.74

Untreated, patients with MEN2 ultimately develop
MTC, which is the most common cause of death in the
MEN2 and related syndromes. Although the calcium
pentagastrin test is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis
of MTC, it is associated with significant side effects and
requires annual testing of each family member. Because
early detection and intervention are paramount to patient
survival, genetic tests were needed to prospectively identify MEN2 patients at-risk for accelerated MTC and
requiring immediate treatment.
In 1995, shortly after the discovery that mutations
in RET caused all forms of hereditary MTC, Wells’ group
began performing thyroidectomies based on identification
of mutated RET alleles in kindred members at direct risk
for inheriting hereditary MTC. Using PCR-based testing
(confirmed by haplotype analysis) for 19 known RET
mutations, Wells studied 132 members of 7 kindreds
with MEN2A. Twenty-one of the 58 subjects at risk for
the disease had germline mutations in the RET oncogene
associated with MEN2A. Plasma calcitonin levels were
elevated in 9 of the 21 subjects. However, 12 subjects had
normal levels of calcitonin. After undergoing genetic
counseling, 13 of the 21 subjects with detected germline
mutations in RET, including 6 with normal serum calcitonin levels, underwent total thyroidectomies with central
lymph node dissections. All of the surgically resected thyroid glands demonstrated C-cell hyperplasia, many with
evidence of MTC. However, there was no evidence of
lymph node metastasis in any patient at the time of surgery. In addition, postoperative stimulated serum calcitonin levels were undetectable. Wells concluded that for
family members who have germline mutations in the RET
proto-oncogene, total thyroidectomy is indicated irrespective of plasma calcitonin levels.75 Genetic screening
and timely thyroidectomy in kindred members who have
germline mutated RET alleles characteristic of MEN2 can
prevent MTC, the most common cause of death in these
syndromes.15
More recently, a number of studies have confirmed
the significance of age-appropriate thyroidectomy on

multicenter study in which 207 patients from 145 families
were enrolled.76 Patients were included in the study if
they were 20 years or younger, asymptomatic, and had
undergone total thyroidectomy after confirmation of a
germline RET point mutation. There was a significant
age-related progression from C-cell hyperplasia to MTC
and, ultimately, nodal metastasis in patients whose RET
mutations were grouped according to the extracellularand intracellular-domain codons affected and in those
with the codon 634 genotype. Skinner and associates evaluated 50 consecutive asymptomatic children having prophylactic thyroidectomy after genetic screening had
identified that they had inherited MEN2A. Physical examination and a calcium/pentagastrin stimulation test
were performed at least 5 years following thyroidectomy.

There was no physical evidence of MTC in any child and
stimulated serum calcitonin did not increase over undetectable baseline levels in 44 (88%) of the them indicating
that C-cells were absent. All 22 children having thyroidectomy prior to 8 years of age were cured, however, 6 of 28
children older than 8 years of age, had elevated stimulated
plasma calcitonin levels within 5 years of thyroidectomy
documenting persistent or recurrent MTC.77 Frank-Raue

and underwent totally thyroidectomy.78 The asymptomatic patients were stratified into 2 groups (levels 1 and 2)

patients with level 1 mutations were cured, whereas 14%
of patients with level 2 mutations were not cured. The

associated with recurrent MTC.79 A total of 93 MEN2
patients were identified as RET-mutation carriers who
underwent total thyroidectomy before 20 years of age.
Disease-free patients were compared to those with recurrent disease. On multivariate analysis, only age of surgery
was associated with persistent disease. In 2013, Shepet
et al analyzed 28 patients who underwent age-appropriate
surgery for hereditary MTC compared to those who had
thyroidectomy past the recommended age according to
the NANETS guidelines.80 They found that patients who
underwent surgery according to the NANETS guidelines
were cured with no disease recurrence, whereas patients
who underwent surgery past the recommended age had a
42% recurrence rate. The excellent prognosis associated
with identification of MTC at its earliest stage underscores the importance of early diagnosis by RET-mutation
analysis for patients at risk for familial MTC.
Advanced Disease

Unfortunately, the majority of patients with hereditary
MTC and all patients with sporadic MTC present with a
thyroid nodule and most of them already have metastases
to regional lymph nodes or distant sites including brain,
bone, lung, and liver. In these patients, thyroidectomy
with nodal clearance is rarely curative, even though some
patients have repeat operations to remove residual tumor.
Distant metastases limited to a single organ may be considered for curative surgical resection or another treatment
modality, such as radiofrequency ablation or external
beam radiation therapy. Chemotherapy is relatively ineffective in patients with MTC, and the infrequent
responses that occur are short lived. External beam radiotherapy may improve locoregional disease control,
although an improvement in overall survival has not been
established.81 Consequently, effective therapy for patients
with systemic disease is sorely needed and recently several
molecular targeted therapeutics (MTTs) have been used
in clinical trials of patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC.
There have been several clinical trials of MTTs in
various formats of patients with MTC.82-87 The most
effective agents are the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors
vandetanib and carbozantinib, approved by the FDA for
patients with advanced MTC in 2011 and 2012, respectively.88 Vandetanib selectively targets RET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and -3 (VEGFR2/3),
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling
that contribute to the growth and invasiveness of MTC.89

Wells et al. conducted a phase 3 trial comparing vandetanib and placebo in 331 patients with advanced MTC.90
Patients receiving vandetanib had significant improvement in median progression-free survival (estimated 30
versus 19.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.31-0.69; P < .001; median follow-up 24
months), objective response rate (45% versus 13%;
P < .001), disease control rate (87% versus 71%;
P 5 .001), and biochemical response (69% versus 3%;
P < .001) compared to placebo. However, nearly all
patients experienced at least one adverse event and 55%
experienced a grade 3 or higher adverse event. Cabozantinib selectively targets hepatocyte growth factor receptor
(HGFR/MET), VEGFR2, and RET that promote invasive growth and angiogenesis in MTC.91-93 Elisei et al
conducted a phase 3 trial comparing cabozantinib with
placebo in 330 patients with progressive metastatic
MTC.94 Patients receiving cabozantinib had improved
median progression-free survival (11.2 versus 4.0 months;
hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19-0.40; P < .001; median
follow-up 13.9 months) and objective response rate (28%
versus 0%; P < .001) compared to placebo. However,
adverse events resulted in dose reductions in 79%, holds
in 65%, and treatment discontinuation in 16% of
cabozantinib-treated patients. Both cabozantinib and vandetanib are approved as first-line therapies for advanced
MTC independent of RET-mutational status.
Other multikinase inhibitors sorafenib,84,95 axiti82
nib, and motesanib83 have been investigated in phase 2
trials with moderate response rates. Preliminary data from
a phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of lenvatinib in 59
patients with unresectable MTC and disease progression
was presented at the 2012 ASCO Annual Meeting.96 Lenvatinib is an oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting
RET, VEGFR1 through VEGFR3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 4, (FGFR1 through FGFR4),
stem cell factor receptor (CD117/SCFR/KIT), and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRb).
There was a median progression-free survival of 9.0
months (46% events observed), an objective response rate
of 35% in patients receiving prior anti-VEGF therapy and
response rate of 36% in patients that did not receive prior
anti-VEGF therapy. Importantly, there were no clear differences in treatment responses based on RET-mutational
status. However, 54% of patients required dose reduction
and 22% required treatment discontinuation due to drug
toxicity.
Other agents are currently under study and various
investigators are initiating trials of combinatorial therapy
for patients with advanced MTC as well as other thyroid
1927

cancers. Recent evidence suggests that aberrations in the
PI3K/AKT, MAPK, Notch, and the glycogen synthase
kinase-3 pathways may contribute to tumor growth in
MTC.97-101 Small molecule inhibitors of these pathways
are also currently being investigated as potential therapies
for MTC.102-105 The use of MTTs in patients with the
various types of thyroid cancer offers a new therapeutic
modality for patients with advanced disease, where formerly there had been nothing.
Summary

MEN2 is a genetic syndrome caused by mutations in the
RET proto-oncogene with different penetrance producing
3 variants, MEN2A, MEN2B, and FMTC, each of which
is characterized by MTC. The discovery of RET mutations that cause MEN2 lead to the development of genetic
testing that enabled personalized approaches to diagnosis,
risk stratification, and appropriate treatment.
