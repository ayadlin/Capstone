Abstract
The effectiveness of therapies targeting specific pathways in
breast cancer, such as the estrogen receptor or HER2, is
limited because many tumors manifest resistance, either
de novo or acquired, during the course of treatment. To
investigate molecular mechanisms of resistance, we used two
xenograft models of estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast
cancer, one with and one without HER2 overexpression
(MCF7/HER2-18 and MCF7 wt, respectively). Mice with
established tumors were assigned to the following treatment
groups: estrogen supplementation (E2), estrogen deprivation
(ED), ED plus tamoxifen (Tam), all with or without the
epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor
gefitinib (G). Another group received ED plus the antiestrogen
fulvestrant (MCF7 wt only). Tumors with acquired or de novo
resistance to these endocrine therapies were profiled for gene
expression and compared with tumors in the E2 control
group. One class of genes underexpressed in endocrineresistant tumors (relative to E2-treated tumors) were estrogen
inducible in vitro and associated with ER+ human breast
cancers (luminal subtype). Another class of genes overexpressed in tumors with acquired resistance in both models
represented transcriptional targets of HER2 signaling and
was associated with ER /HER2+ human cancers (ERBB2+
subtype). A third class of genes overexpressed in MCF7/HER218 tumors exhibiting de novo resistance to tamoxifen was
associated with ER+ human cancers but not with estrogenregulated genes. Thus, in response to various endocrine
therapy regimens, these xenograft breast tumors shut down
classic estrogen signaling and activate alternative pathways
such as HER2 that contribute to treatment resistance. Over
time, the molecular phenotype of breast cancer can change.

Introduction
Great strides have been made in breast cancer treatment
using therapies that target specific molecular pathways. In the
clinic, two tumor molecular markers are used to help predict

therapeutic response in breast cancer: estrogen receptor a (ER)
and the growth factor receptor HER2 (erbB-2/neu). Approximately
70% of breast cancers express ER (ER+ tumors) and tend to
rely on the classic estrogen signaling pathway for growth (1, 2).
Patients with these tumors are usually treated with either
antiestrogens or aromatase inhibitors to block ER signaling. In
addition, the 20% to 25% of tumors with gene amplification of
HER2 (HER2+ tumors) rely on its signaling pathway for growth
(3), and HER2+ patients can be successfully treated by agents
targeting HER2. Tumors that express neither ER nor HER2 rely on
poorly defined alternative pathways and currently have no
effective targeted therapy. Of the breast cancer patients treated
with targeted therapies, many do not respond, and of those who
do, many acquire resistance over time. Although adjuvant therapy
studies of the antiestrogen tamoxifen show a 40% to 50%
reduction in the odds of disease recurrence and a 30% to 35%
reduction in mortality in ER+ breast cancer, still de novo and
acquired resistance to ER-targeted therapy remains a major
problem (4). In the metastatic setting, 30% to 50% of ER+ tumors
initially respond to tamoxifen, but essentially all of these tumors
eventually acquire resistance, leading to disease progression and
death (4).
In previous studies, we have used breast cancer xenograft model
systems to investigate the mechanisms of resistance to targeted
therapies in vivo (5–10). In our models, as in the clinical setting
outlined above, resistance to treatment can take the form of
de novo resistance, where the tumor shows no initial response, or
acquired resistance, where the tumor initially responds but
eventually escapes with progressive growth. Analysis of individual
molecular marker expression have revealed a role for growth factor
signaling via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2
(6, 8) and stress-related pathways associated with p38 and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases (5, 7) in de novo and acquired
resistance to endocrine therapy.
In this present study, we profiled the expression of more
than 50,000 mRNA transcripts in xenograft tumors that initially
were either ER+/HER2+ or ER+/HER2
and that acquired
resistance to various targeted therapy regimens. In addition,
we profiled ER+/HER2+ tumors that manifested de novo
resistance to tamoxifen. The goal of this study was to define
and characterize the global gene expression patterns associated
with the resistant phenotypes. Several studies using clinical breast
tumors have defined distinct global molecular subtypes associated
with markers such as ER and HER2 (11–15). An important aspect
of our study was to compare the gene signatures derived from our
model system with gene signatures derived from clinical breast

Results
Materials and Methods
Xenograft studies. MCF7 wt and MCF7/HER2-18 xenograft experiments were carried out as previously reported (6, 8, 10, 16–18) and
are described in Supplementary Material. Details of cell culture methods
and animal experiments were previously described (6, 8, 10, 16–18).
Tumors were harvested for molecular studies either after 2 to 3 wk
of treatment (sensitive, ‘‘S,’’ or early-growth, ‘‘E,’’ tumors, <400 mm3 in size)
or when they reached the size of 1,000 mm3 (resistant, ‘‘R,’’ or late-growth,
‘‘L,’’ tumors). Each tumor analyzed was from a different mouse; tumor
tissues were removed from each individual mouse and kept at 190jC
for later analyses. Graphs constructed for this article (Fig. 1) represent
individual tumors from each of the different treatment groups as
indicated.
Affymetrix microarray analysis. We used Affymetrix U133 Plus
2 Genechip arrays to determine gene expression patterns of tumor
xenografts. RNA extraction was carried out in BioRobot EZ1 workstation
using EZ1 RNA universal tissue kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis, cRNA labeling, and array hybridization were done as previously described (19). Arrays were processed and
normalized using the dChiP software (20). Array data have been deposited
in the public Gene Expression Omnibus database, accessions GSE8139 and
GSE8140. Expression data set filtering and transformation are detailed in
Supplementary Material.
ANOVA using dChip identified genes that differed in mean gene
mRNA levels in any one of the xenograft tumor treatment groups.
Two-sample t tests determined significant differences in gene expression
between any two specific groups of samples (P values were two sided).
Selection of t test P value cutoffs for defining gene groups was guided by a
desire to have a sizable number of genes for inter–data set comparisons
(where a smaller number of tumor profiles were involved in the t test, a
looser criteria such as P < 0.01 versus P < 0.001 might be used). Expression
values were visualized as heat maps using the Cluster (21) and Java
TreeView (22) software. One-sided Fisher’s exact tests and Q1-Q2 analysis
(23) were used to determine statistically significant enrichment of subsets

In vivo models of endocrine therapy resistance in ER+/
HER2 (MCF7 wt) and ER+/HER2+ (MCF7/HER2-18) breast
cancer xenografts. To further investigate mechanisms of growth
inhibition and hormone treatment resistance, we used tumors from
two of our previously defined in vivo xenograft models of ER+
breast cancer: one of MCF7 wild-type cells (MCF7 wt) and one of
MCF7 cells stably transfected with overexpressing HER2 (MCF7/
HER2-18; refs. 6, 8, 10, 16–18). In previous studies, MCF7 wt and
MCF7/HER2-18 cells were each established as xenografts in
ovariectomized athymic nude mice in the presence of estrogen.
When tumors reached a sufficient size (150–200 mm3), mice were
randomly assigned to various treatment groups (as detailed in
Supplementary Methods and listed in Table 1). MCF7 wt tumors
received continued estrogen supplementation (E2), E2 with the
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (E2+G), estrogen deprivation (ED), estrogen deprivation plus the antiestrogen tamoxifen
(Tam), ED plus tamoxifen with gefitinib (Tam+G), or ED plus ICI
182,780 ( fulvestrant, or Fulv). MCF7/HER2-18 tumors received E2,
E2+G, ED, ED+G, tamoxifen, Tam+G, or E2+Tam.
Figure 1 shows a representative individual tumor growth curve
from each of the treatment groups in each model (MCF7 wt and
HER2-18) followed over time. These data and earlier experiments
leading up to them have been presented and described in detail in
prior reports (6, 8, 10, 16–18). Whereas MCF7 wt tumors in E2supplemented mice grew at a steady exponential rate, wild-type
tumors in treated mice (the ED, tamoxifen, Tam+G, Fulv groups)
initially stopped growing (‘‘sensitive’’ phase of treatment). However,
after several months, the E2-deprived tumors begin to grow rapidly
at a rate comparable with that of the E2 control group (‘‘resistant’’
phase of treatment). The time to treatment resistance varied
among the treatment groups, with the Tam+G and Fulv groups

taking f2 to 3 months longer to acquire resistance than the ED
and tamoxifen groups; resistance, however, eventually developed in
all treatment groups. In the MCF7/HER2-18 model, the behavior of
E2-deprived tumors was similar to that of the MCF7 wt model.
However, unlike the MCF7 wt tumors, HER2-18 tumors were
growth stimulated by ED+Tam as the mechanism of de novo
resistance. HER2-18 tumors were inhibited by tamoxifen combined
with gefitinib, which restores the antitumor effect of tamoxifen by
blocking the HER2 pathway (6).
Gene expression signatures of endocrine therapy resistance
in MCF7 wt and MCF7/HER2-18 xenografts. MCF7 wt and
MCF7/HER2-18 tumors, which had manifested resistance to
various endocrine therapies (tumors in the ED, tamoxifen, and
Tam+G groups, as well as tumors in the MCF7 wt Fulv and MCF7/
HER2-18 ED+G groups)—along with growing tumors from the E2
treatment groups (E2 alone as well as E2+G and MCF7/HER2-18
E2+Tam)—were profiled for 54,675 mRNA transcripts (list of
profiled tumor groups in Table 1). In addition to ‘‘resistant’’
tumors, we profiled MCF7/HER2-18 ‘‘sensitive’’ tumors in which
growth was inhibited by ED, ED+G, and Tam+G groups. In addition,
MCF7/HER2-18 tumors treated and stimulated by E2, E2+G, and
tamoxifen were profiled after 3 weeks of treatment (early tumors)
and again after 8 weeks (late tumors), at tumor volumes that
closely corresponded to the sensitive and resistant tumors of the
other treatment groups. One profile of a HER2-18 ED+G–sensitive
tumor was taken, its profile appearing similar to the HER2-18
ED–sensitive group (Fig. 2A). For the HER2-18 E2+G group,
gefitinib led to significant yet modest inhibition of growth
(Fig. 1), and thus we still referred to these tumors as early (‘‘E’’)
versus late (‘‘L’’; rather than sensitive versus resistant).
For the MCF7/HER2-18 profile data, we performed hierarchical
clustering (24) of all 6,883 transcripts that differed significantly in

www.aacrjournals.org

mean mRNA levels in any treatment group compared with the
other groups (P < 0.001, ANOVA). The clustered expression patterns
were visualized as a color map (Fig. 2A). From the overall clustering
pattern, we observed three sizable gene groups. Going back to the
original data set, we used supervised approaches to define the sets
of genes with patterns that were representative of each of the three
clustering patterns of Fig. 2A (Fig. 2B; Table 2): (a) a set of 525
uniquely identified genes, designated group 1 genes, that were
more highly expressed in the E2 treatment groups (both with
and without gefitinib) than in both the ED/ED+G resistant groups
(P < 0.001, t test) and the Tam/Tam+G late/resistant groups
(P < 0.001); (b) a set of 474 genes, the group 2 genes, that were
higher in the Tam/Tam+G late/resistant groups (P < 0.01), the Tam/
Tam+G early/sensitive groups (P < 0.01), and the ED sensitive
groups (P < 0.01), all compared with the E2/E2+G groups, but were
not higher in the ED/ED+G resistant groups compared with the E2/
E2+G groups (P > 0.05); and (c) a set of 720 genes, the group 3
genes, that were higher in both the ED/ED+G resistant groups
(P < 0.001) and the Tam/Tam+G late/resistant groups (P < 0.001),
compared with the E2/E2+G groups.
We analyzed the MCF7 wt profile data in a similar manner to the
MCF7/HER2-18 data. Hierarchical clustering of 1,363 transcripts
differing in mean mRNA levels in any treatment group (P < 0.01,
ANOVA) uncovered two major gene groups of interest (Fig. 2C; as
there were fewer experimental groups in the MCF7 wt data set
compared with MCF7/HER2-18, using a higher ANOVA P value
cutoff for MCF7 wt seemed appropriate to account for the lower
power to detect differences in any one group). From the original
data set, we obtained the following genes to represent each
clustering pattern (Fig. 2D; Table 2): (a) a set of 310 unique named
genes, which we designated the group 4 genes, that were higher in
the E2 treatment groups [with and without gefitinib (G)] compared

and compared with the Tam/Tam+G resistant groups (P < 0.01);
and (b) a set of 483 genes, the ‘‘group 5’’ genes, that were higher in
both the ED/Fulv resistant groups (P < 0.01) and the Tam/Tam+G
resistant groups (P < 0.01) compared with the E2/E2+G groups.
There are very likely other gene expression patterns of interest
existing in our profile data that are more subtle and may include
fewer genes. In this study, however, we focused on analysis of the
five major gene groups identified here, leaving open the
opportunity to further mine the data in future studies.
For the set of genes in any one of the five groups (Fig. 2B and D;
Table 2; complete list was provided in Supplementary Data File 1),
we compared the expression patterns of the MCF7/HER2-18 data
set side by side with those of the MCF7 wt data set. We observed
high overlap between the MCF7/HER2-18 group 1 and the MCF7 wt
group 4 (Fig. 3), both of these gene groups being higher in the
respective E2 treatment groups compared with the estrogendeprived groups. Between the groups 1 and 4 genes, 85 were
shared; when we relaxed the criteria for inclusion of genes from
one group within the other group (looking for genes included in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

one of the two groups and that would have been included in the
other group had cutoffs of P < 0.05 been used to define it), 215
genes could be considered shared. Similarly, the MCF7/HER2-18
group 3 overlapped highly with the MCF7 wt group 5 (Fig. 3), genes
in either of these groups being more highly expressed in their
respective estrogen-deprived compared with E2 treatment groups;
between groups 3 and 5, 117 genes were shared (303 using relaxed
criteria). For the MCF7/HER2-18 group 2 genes, which were
overexpressed in the tamoxifen-resistant and ED-sensitive tumor
groups but not in the ED-resistant groups, no corresponding
patterns were found in the MCF7 wt data; in particular, the group 2
genes were not overexpressed in the MCF7 wt tamoxifen-resistant
groups as might have been expected (Fig. 3).
ESR1 (ER) and PGR (PR) mRNA were both low in most resistant
tumors compared with E2 control (Fig. 3). We have previously
reported that ER expression at the protein level is lost in the MCF7/
HER2-18 resistant tumors, except ED+Tam alone (8). Furthermore,
HER2 mRNA seemed elevated in both MCF7 wt and MCF7/HER-18
resistant tumors compared with E2 controls (Fig. 3), which is
consistent with our prior observations of increased HER2

protein expression in patients with tamoxifen resistance (7) and in
our experimental model (17). These results indicate that the
molecular phenotype of tumors can change with time as they
develop treatment resistance, changing from an ER+ to an ER
phenotype. We further explored this idea below through analysis of
the whole sets of genes associated with resistance.
Genes underexpressed in endocrine-resistant tumors, both
MCF7 wt and MCF7/HER2-18, are estrogen regulated and
associated with ER+/PR+ human breast cancers. The MCF7/
HER2-18 group 1 genes and the MCF7 wt group 4 genes
were both more highly expressed in the respective E2 compared
with estrogen-deprived treatment groups. To determine which of
these genes might be targets of the classic estrogen signaling

Selected example genes

pathway, we examined the corresponding expression patterns
of the groups 1 and 4 genes in an expression profile data set
from a previous study (25) of breast cancer cell cultures
stimulated by estradiol (E2) over a time course of 1 to 24 hours
(Fig. 3). The groups 1 and 4 genes had high enrichment of genes
induced by E2 in vitro (i.e., genes in estrogen clusters B, C, and D
as defined in ref. 25). Of the 525 group 1 genes (Fig. 2A), 116,
more than 20%, were estrogen induced (significance of overlap
P < 1E 35, one-sided Fisher’s exact), 63 of these within 4 hours of
E2 treatment, suggesting that they represent primary estrogenregulated genes. Of the 310 group 4 genes (Fig. 2D; Table 2),
74 were estrogen induced (Fisher’s exact P < 1E 24), 51 within
4 hours.

of three different breast cancer cell lines stimulated with E2
over a time course from 0 to 24 h (gray, data not

three data sets represented, allowing one to observe
where the various MCF7 xenograft gene sets from the two
models overlap and what proportion of these genes
appear estrogen regulated.

Figure 4. Enrichment analysis of xenograft tumor genes within human breast tumor expression profiles. A, Q1-Q2 enrichment patterns of the five xenograft
gene sets (Figs. 2 and 3) across three different profile data sets of human breast tumors (11, 13, 26). Four different human breast tumor gene rankings were evaluated:
genes with higher average expression in ER+ compared with ER tumors [ER+ (over ER ) ]; genes with high correlation (i.e., similarity) with PR mRNA within the
subset of ER+ tumors (ER+_PR ); genes correlated with HER2 mRNA expression patterns within ER+ tumors (ER+_HER2); and genes correlated with HER2
mRNA within ER tumors (ER _HER2 ). B, RNA expression patterns across MCF7 xenograft and clinical breast tumor data sets for the following sets of genes:
ER, PR, and HER2 (top panels ); genes in any one of the MCF7 xenograft groups 1-5 (Fig. 2) that were also differentially expressed in ER+ versus ER clinical tumors
(middle panels ); and genes in MCF7 xenograft groups 1 to 5 that were also correlated or anticorrelated with HER2 mRNA in ER clinical tumors (bottom panels ).
Alongside the ER status–associated genes are the corresponding patterns for E2-stimulated breast cell cultures. Alongside the HER2/ER associated genes are the
corresponding patterns for MCF7 cells with MAP kinase activated through various genes (28). The order of the genes is the same across all data sets represented.
Patterns of enrichment (where xenograft and human tumor expression patterns share high overlap contributing to enrichment associations) are indicated. C, heat

We then examined the expression patterns of MCF7/HER2-18
group 1 genes and the MCF7 wt group 4 genes in human
breast tumors to ascertain the possible clinical context for our
experimentally derived genes. We obtained three independent

(213 ER+). We sought to determine whether any enrichment existed
between our xenograft gene sets and relevant expression patterns
in the human tumor data sets. Enrichment was assessed using the
rigorous Q1-Q2 method (described in detail in refs. 23, 27 and in
Supplementary Material), which tested against randomly generated
xenograft gene sets or human tumor profile labels.
By Q1-Q2 (results shown in Fig. 4A), the groups 1 and 4 gene sets
(highly expressed in the E2 control groups for their respectively
models; Table 2) were each significantly enriched in ER+ tumors
having high PR mRNA levels (these genes being positively
correlated as a group with PR mRNA within the ER+ tumors).
These patterns were observed in all three tumor data sets
examined (group 1: van de Vijver P < 1E 07, Wang P < 1E 08,
Miller P = 0.0005; group 4: van de Vijver P < 1E 11, Wang
P < 1E 11, Miller P < 1E 6). Furthermore, groups 1 and 4 genes
were significantly enriched in ER+ over ER human tumors in each
of the clinical data sets (group 1: P < 0.00005; group 4: P < 1E 06).
We evaluated the set of genes shared between groups 1 and 4
(Fig. 3), as well as the genes specific to group 1 and not group 4 and
genes specific to group 4 and not group 1; only the genes that were
shared between groups 1 and 4 were consistently enriched in
ER+/PR+ tumors.
The ER+-associated human tumor enrichment patterns described above were evident when viewing the gene expression
patterns involved using color maps (Fig. 4B). Of the 215 genes that
were shared between groups 1 and 4, a high overlap of 51 (chance
expected 13, P < 1E 17, one-sided Fisher’s exact) were also higher
in ER+ over ER human tumors; in contrast, 22 genes were lower
in ER+ human tumors, a number closer to the chance expected.
Nearly all of the 51 group 1/group 4/ER+ human tumor genes in
the profile data set of E2-stimulated breast cancer cell cultures
(25) showed induction by E2 in vitro (Fig. 4B). These genes also
tended to be correlated with higher PR mRNA levels within the
ER+ group of tumors (Fig. 4A; although this is not evident in the
Fig. 4B representation, as PR was uniformly higher in ER+ over
ER tumors).
Genes overexpressed in MCF7 wt and MCF7/HER2-18
endocrine-resistant tumors are associated with the HER2
pathway and with ER /HER2+ human breast cancers. The
MCF7/HER2-18 group 3 genes and the MCF7 wt group 5 genes
(Table 2) were both more highly expressed in the respective
endocrine-resistant compared with the E2 control groups. In the
HER2-18 data set, endocrine-sensitive tumors had levels of
expression for the group 3 genes that were between those of the
E2 controls and the fully resistant tumors (Fig. 3), indicating that
these genes were correlated with acquired resistance. When
considering the expression profile data set of E2-stimulated breast
cancer cell cultures, many of the groups 3 and 5 genes seemed
to be targets of estrogen-mediated repression (Figs. 3 and 4B;
Supplementary Material).
We examined the expression patterns of the MCF7/HER2-18
group 3 genes and the MCF7 wt group 5 genes in human breast
tumors (results shown in Fig. 4A). For the subset of ER human
breast tumors in each of three profile data sets, the groups 3 and
5 genes were enriched within the genes positively correlated with
HER2 (ERBB2) mRNA levels (group 3: van de Vijver P = 0.006, Wang
P < 1E 05, Miller P = 0.03; group 5: van de Vijver P < 5E 6, Wang
P < 1E 7, Miller P < 0.001, Q1-Q2). The subset of ER+ tumors,
however, had no similar enrichment patterns with respect to
HER2 mRNA (Fig. 4A and B), indicating that many of the xenograft
groups 3 and 5 genes are overexpressed in ER /HER2+ compared

www.aacrjournals.org

with ER /HER2 tumors but are not overexpressed in ER+/HER2+
compared with ER+/HER2 tumors. The ER /HER2+–associated
human tumor enrichment patterns uncovered by Q1-Q2 analysis
(Fig. 4A) were evident when viewing the gene expression patterns
involved using color maps (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Material).
The ER /HER2+ tumors from the van de Vijver, Wang, and
Miller data sets were an approximate surrogate for the ‘‘ERBB2+’’
tumor class defined by Sorlie and colleagues (14, 15), and the
groups 3 and 5 genes also overlapped with genes defining this class
(Supplementary Material). In another recent study (28), gene
expression profiles were taken of MCF-7 breast cancer cells
with stably overexpressed EGFR or constitutively activated HER2
(erbB-2), Raf, or MAP/ERK kinase. The MCF7/HER2-18 group 3 and
MCF7 wt group 5 genes each overlapped significantly with the
genes high in the MCF-7/HER2 cell lines (Fig. 4B; Supplementary
Material). In summary, we observed that breast tumors converted
from one molecular phenotype (ER+ or luminal) to another
(ER /HER2+ or ERBB2+) after treatment.
Genes overexpressed in MCF7/HER2-18 tumors with de novo
resistance to tamoxifen are associated with ER+/PR+ human
breast cancers but are not estrogen regulated. In the MCF7/
HER2-18 data set, the group 2 genes were more highly expressed in
both the ED+Tam groups (early and late) and ED-sensitive group
compared with the E2-treated groups, but were not more highly
expressed in the ED-resistant groups (Figs. 2D and 3). These group
2 patterns were not observed in the MCF7 wt data set (as they were
not overexpressed in the wild-type tamoxifen-resistant tumors).
Interestingly, the expression of the group 2 genes was attenuated in
the Tam+G–treated resistant MCF7/HER2-18 tumors relative to the
tamoxifen tumors (Fig. 3). The group 2 genes had no significant
number of E2-regulated transcripts (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the
group 2 genes were enriched in ER+/PR+ compared with
ER+/PR human breast tumors, as well as in ER+ compared with
ER tumors (Fig. 4A). Of the 474 group 2 genes, 52 were higher in
ER+ over ER human tumors (Fisher’s exact P = 0.00001), yet
virtually none of these genes were estrogen regulated (Fig. 4B).
MCF7 wt and MCF7/HER2-18 endocrine-resistant xenograft
tumor profiles are globally associated with the ERBB2+
human breast tumor molecular profile subtype. Previous
studies in gene expression profiling of human breast cancers have
identified at least four major tumor subtypes (luminal A, luminal B,
basal, ERBB2+) and a normal breast tissue group (15). Although our
above analyses associated specific sets of genes overexpressed in
endocrine-resistant xenograft tumors with the HER2 pathway
(Fig. 4A and B), we went on to do a global comparison between
each of our xenograft tumor profiles and the molecular profile
subtypes as defined by a previously published human breast tumor
data set by Hoadley and colleagues (29). For each gene common to
our array platform and the Hoadley platform, we computed the
mean centroid of the four major Hoadley tumor subtypes and
centered each group average on the centroid. We then took the
Pearson’s correlation (using all 7,316 genes common to both data
sets) between the Hoadley centered averages and the expression
values of each xenograft tumor.
The profile-to-subtype correlation analyses (graphically represented in Fig. 4C) showed both an overall trend for the E2-treated
and sensitive/early xenograft tumors (both MCF7/HER2-18 and
MCF7 wt models) to associate with the luminal subtype (either
luminal A or luminal B or both), and an overall trend for the
resistant/late tumors to associate with the ERBB2+ group. At the
same time, a few individual tumors were found to show

associations not consistent with those of their experimental group
and tumors could associate with more than one subtype
(e.g., luminal A and luminal B). By our using all of the profiled
genes, the Hoadley results were not influenced by our previous
definitions of the five gene groups (Table 2). Therefore, by
alternative analyses approaches, we could observe that the
xenograft tumors converted from one molecular phenotype to
another after acquiring treatment resistance.

Discussion
In our model system, we examined the behavior of two different
breast cancer cell lines in response to therapies targeting the
estrogen and HER signaling pathways: MCF7 wt, which is thought
to represent the ER+/HER2 clinical subtype, and MCF7/HER2-18,
which is thought to represent the ER+/HER2+ subtype. When these
cell lines are grown as tumor xenografts in the presence of
estrogen, they rely on the classic estrogen/ER signaling pathway for
growth. When estrogen supplementation is removed, the tumors
from both cell lines shut down classic estrogen signaling, as
indicated by the loss of expression of the groups 1 and 4 gene sets,
more than 20% of which genes are up-regulated by estrogen. It has
been hypothesized that breast cancers with acquired resistance to
ED or tamoxifen might somehow reactivate classic estrogen
signaling (e.g., through increasing estrogen agonist effects of
antiestrogens, by ligand-independent activation of ER via growth
factor signaling, or by an activating mutation in ER; refs. 6, 30, 31).
However, reactivation of estrogen signaling was not observed in
our system as a mechanism of resistance.
To acquire endocrine resistance, our MCF7 wt and MCF7/HER218 tumors activate growth factor signaling pathways, including
HER2 and EGFR (6–8). By correlating the gene expression patterns
from our xenograft models with patterns from clinical breast
tumors, we determined that our xenograft tumors with acquired
resistance represented at the transcriptome level the ER /HER2+
clinical breast cancer subtype (also known as the ‘‘ERBB2+’’
molecular subtype; ref. 14). The groups 3 and 5 genes (overexpressed
in the endocrine-resistant tumors) each shared extensive overlap
with genes high in ER /HER2+ clinical tumors, these genes also
being highly enriched for transcriptional targets of HER2 signaling
in vitro. In addition, we recently showed (32) that more specific
HER-2 inhibition using a variety of compounds had greater efficacy
in inhibiting growth of our HER2-overexpressing xenografts.
In this study, we observed in our model system that acquired
resistance to various ER-targeted therapies transformed the
clinically associated molecular profile subtype of breast cancer
from that of an estrogen-dependent, ER+ tumor to that of a growth
factor–dependent, ER /HER2+ tumor. Resistant MCF7 wt tumors
had been previously found to retain ER protein expression (16),
although here these tumors appeared ER at the transcriptome

level. This switch from ER+ to ER /HER2+ perhaps is not
surprising in the MCF7/HER2-18 tumors, which overexpress
HER2 to begin with. However, our MCF7 wt tumors did not
overexpress HER2 and targets of this pathway before being
deprived of estrogen (Fig. 3; see also refs. 7, 17). This up-regulation
of HER2 as well as EGFR has been observed in other preclinical
models of endocrine therapy resistance (33–36). Furthermore,
recent findings show that HER2 gene amplification can be acquired
as breast cancer progresses in patients receiving endocrine therapy
(7, 37, 38).
One popular idea in molecular oncology is to identify molecular
markers predicting tumor response to targeted therapies. Breast
cancer treatment is a prime example of this idea being put into
clinical practice, with patients whose tumors express ER receiving
endocrine therapy and patients whose tumors express HER2
receiving anti-HER2 therapy. At the same time, our study here
suggests that using gene expression of pretreatment tumors to
predict response might be limited to predicting initial response and
would not necessarily be predictive of possible mechanisms of
acquired resistance. In our model, we could not have predicted
HER2 as one mechanism of acquired resistance solely on the basis
of the pretreatment tumor data. Our study lends support to a
cancer treatment paradigm that targets not only the tumor in its
pretreatment state, but also the tumor as it might manifest itself
during tumor progression and acquired therapeutic resistance.
Our current clinical practice of treating breast cancer disease
recurrence based on tumor characteristics from the original
diagnosis may, therefore, not take into account the dynamic
nature of cancer progression in response to specific treatments.
Repeating tumor biopsies at the time of cancer recurrence may be
critical to correctly identify molecular targets for more tailored
therapeutic options with the hope that this strategy can improve
outcome in patients with breast cancer.
