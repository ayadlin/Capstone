Abstract
Cell lines are crucial to elucidate mechanisms of tumorigenesis and serve as tools for cancer treatment screenings.
Therefore, careful validation of whether these models have
conserved properties of in vivo tumors is highly important.
Thyrocyte-derived tumors are very interesting for cancer
biology studies because from one cell type, at least five
histologically characterized different benign and malignant
tumor types can arise. To investigate whether thyroid tumor–
derived cell lines are representative in vitro models, characteristics of eight of those cell lines were investigated with
microarrays, differentiation markers, and karyotyping. Our
results indicate that these cell lines derived from differentiated and undifferentiated tumor types have evolved in vitro
into similar phenotypes with gene expression profiles the
closest to in vivo undifferentiated tumors. Accordingly, the
absence of expression of most thyrocyte-specific genes,
the nonresponsiveness to thyrotropin, as well as their large
number of chromosomal abnormalities, suggest that these cell
lines have acquired characteristics of fully dedifferentiated
cells. They represent the outcome of an adaptation and
evolution in vitro, which questions the reliability of these cell
lines as models for differentiated tumors. However, they may
represent useful models for undifferentiated cancers, and by
their comparison with differentiated cells, can help to define
the genes involved in the differentiation/dedifferentiation
process. The use of any cell line as a model for a cancer
therefore requires prior careful and thorough validation for
the investigated property. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8113–20]

Introduction
Tumor-derived cell lines are extensively used in cancer research
because they can provide insight into underlying mechanisms that
play a role in tumor biology. They have a number of advantages,
such as the possibility to generate sufficient quantities of research
material, their use for genetic manipulation, and the opportunity to
use them for both in vitro as well as in vivo (e.g., xenografts) studies.
Cell lines can be useful to elucidate a number of characteristics of

tumors, such as growth kinetics and metastatic properties, and
serve as first-line assays for putative treatments (1–4). Moreover,
the existence of only one cell type in culture can be helpful for the
interpretation of data derived from microarray studies where
tumors are compared with nontumor tissues containing different
cell types that can even exist in different proportions. Therefore,
single cell type–derived cell lines can provide insight into the
primarily deregulated genes in the transformed cells themselves.
They allow analysis of tumor properties and behavior provided that
they have maintained properties of in vivo tumors. We have tested
this hypothesis using as a model tumors of the thyroid.
During the past years, a number of thyroid tumor cell lines from
different pathologic origin have been developed (5–12). Thyroid
tumors are interesting in this context because, compared with
other tissue-derived tumors, at least five different histologically
characterized types of tumors, showing differences in biological
behavior and degree of differentiation, can arise from one cell type
(i.e., the follicular epithelial cell or thyrocyte). These tumors include
two benign tumor types (i.e., hyperfunctioning autonomous
adenomas and follicular adenomas) and three malignant tumor
types [i.e., differentiated follicular carcinomas (FTC), papillary
carcinomas (PTC), and nondifferentiated highly aggressive anaplastic carcinomas (ATC); ref. 13]. Recent studies show that gene
expression profiling by microarrays is able to distinguish in vivo
benign from malignant thyroid tumors (14) and PTCs from FTCs
(15). These findings led us to investigate the in vitro properties of
thyroid tumors by using thyroid tumor–derived cell lines of
different origin whose gene expression profiles were established
and then compared with a panel of in vivo tumors. These commonly used cell lines were derived from one follicular adenoma
(KAK-1), two FTCs (FTC-133 and WRO), three PTCs (B-CPAP, KAT10, and TPC-1), and two ATCs (8505C and KAT-4; refs. 5–12).
Because in vivo thyroid tumors show differences in their degree of
differentiation, we investigated this aspect in the cell lines by using
a number of widely used thyrocyte-specific markers, including the
thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHR), the sodium/iodide symporter
(NIS), thyroglobulin (Tg ), thyroperoxidase (TPO), the two NADPH
oxidases ThOX1 and ThOX2, the transcription factors TTF1 and
TTF2, and the paired-box containing transcription factor-8 (PAX8).
In addition, gene expression profiles of the cell lines were compared with well-characterized differentiated cells to elucidate genes
involved in differentiation. Moreover, the responsiveness of these
cell lines to the physiologic stimulus TSH and to forskolin was
determined, as well as their karyotypes.
Our results show that these cell lines have gene expression profiles
more closely related to each other than to the in vivo differentiated
tumors they were derived from and have characteristics of fully

dedifferentiated cells. In line with these results, comparison of their
overall gene expression profiles with a panel of in vivo thyroid
tumors, containing benign and malignant tumors, showed that the
cell lines group closest with undifferentiated carcinomas (i.e., ATC).
Therefore, the cell lines may be useful models for undifferentiated,
but not for differentiated, thyroid tumors. Their comparison with

liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC until processing. The protocol was
approved by the ethics committees of the institutions.
Microarrays and data analysis. Five micrograms of total RNA from the
cultures and tissues were used for microarray analysis. Samples were
prepared as described previously (16). Scanning of in-house cDNA
microarrays containing 23,232 spots, preprocessing and normalization of
raw data, and replicate averaging were done as previously described (16)
with the bioconductor 1.9 bioinformatics software (18) for the R
programming language 2.4.0. The samples (three ATCs and three PTCs),
which were assayed according to manufacturer’s instructions on oligonucleotide Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays, were
processed together with the bioconductor gcrma package. Each sample was
compared to a control to obtain differential expression measurements (log2
ratio): human thyroid tumor cell lines were compared with a pool of RNA
from six primary cultures of normal human thyrocytes; PTCs, the follicular
adenoma, and FTC were individually analyzed comparing directly each
tumor with its corresponding nontumor adjacent tissue; ATCs were
compared with a pool of normal tissues (n = 23) obtained from the same
lobe as resected lesions. Unsupervised analysis was done on the basis of
between-sample, correlation-based distances. Average linkage was used for
hierarchical clustering (as implemented by the hclust R function), first on
the 17,702 spots remaining after filtering out spots with more than two
missing values across the cell lines (Fig. 1) and, second, in the two-way
clustering for the display of differential expression (Fig. 5).
To assess the stability of the cell lines cluster dendrogram (Fig. 1), we
used a bootstrap approach as implemented in the bioconductor pvclust
package 1.2-0 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Multidimensional scaling (as
implemented by the isoMDS function in the MASS 7.2-29 package for R)
was done to compare the cell lines to the tissues (Fig. 2). To compare the
data from two microarray platforms, we averaged the expression values for
probes annotated with the same National Center for Biotechnology
Information Entrez Gene identifiers within each platform and retained

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Tumor cell lines, originally described to be obtained from
eight different patients, were derived from one follicular adenoma [KAK-1
(5)], two FTCs [FTC-133 (6) and WRO (UCLA-RO 82 W-1; ref. 7)], three PTCs
[B-CPAP (8), KAT-10 (9), and TPC-1 (10)], and two ATCs [8505C (11) and
KAT-4 (12)]. The cell lines KAK-1, KAT-10, and KAT-4 were obtained from Dr.
K.B. Ain (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). FTC-133, WRO, B-CPAP,
and 8505C were a gift from Dr. G. Brabant (Medizinische Hochschule,
Hannover, Germany). TPC-1 was obtained from Dr. M. Mareel (University
of Gent, Gent, Belgium). All cell lines were cultured as monolayers in a
humidified atmosphere (5% CO2) at 37jC according to the instructions of
their providers (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). To investigate
the effect of forskolin on differentiation expression, cell lines were deprived
for 48 h from serum and thereafter incubated with forskolin (10 Amol/L) for
24 h, followed by total RNA isolation for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).
Tumor tissue samples. For the investigation of gene expression profiles
of a panel of benign and malignant thyroid tumors, paired samples of
nontumor and tumor thyroid tissues were obtained from patients
undergoing surgery for thyroid disease. Diagnoses and preparation of a
pool of hyperfunctioning autonomous adenomas (n = 5) was done as
previously described (16). PTCs were obtained from the Ambroise Paré
Hospital (Boulogne, France; sporadic PTCs, n = 10) and from the Institute of
Oncology and Metabolism (Kiev, Ukraine; post-Chernobyl PTCs, n = 6),
which also provided one FTC (n = 1) and one follicular adenoma (n = 1).
ATCs were obtained from the Jules Bordet Institute (Brussels) and the
Ambroise Paré Hospital (France). Final diagnoses were made by
pathologists and characteristics of these tumors are described elsewhere
(17).7 All tissues were immediately dissected, placed on ice, snap-frozen in

tumors consisted of a pool of five hyperfunctioning autonomous adenomas and
one follicular adenoma. Malignant carcinomas consisted of 16 PTCs, 1 FTC, and
3 undifferentiated ATCs. Cell lines, autonomous adenoma, follicular adenoma,
FTC, and PTCs were hybridized on in-house–manufactured slides. Three PTC
samples, already hybridized on homemade slides, and ATCs were hybridized on
Affymetrix slides (in italics ). Analysis was made based on all the genes in
common between the homemade and the Affymetrix platforms. Comparison of
the same PTC samples between the two platforms showed that their gene
expression profiles were highly similar (circled ). Thus, gene expression profiles
from all samples can be compared regardless of the platform. Stress is 13.6%.

the 3,751 genes present in both platforms. To identify genes commonly
regulated across all cell lines (Supplementary Table S3), a one-class
Significance Analysis of Microarrays (19) analysis was run as implemented
in the bioconductor siggenes package version 1.7.1. The remaining missing
values after filtering as described above were replaced by the spot-wise
mean. SAM identified 6,286 significantly regulated spots (q-value < 0.01).
Reverse transcription-PCR. The expressions of TSHR, NIS, Tg, TPO,
ThOX1, ThOX2, TTF1, TTF2, and PAX8 were investigated in the eight human
thyroid tumor cell lines by RT-PCR as described in Supplementary Materials
and Methods. Primer sequences for the investigated genes are given in
Supplementary Table S1.
Cyclic AMP measurements. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) measurements were
done as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Chromosome analysis. For each cell line, 15,000 to 30,000 cells were
seeded in single chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nalgen Nunc International) and
cultured until they reached near confluence. Cells were harvested using
standard methods. Chromosome analysis was done according to the
routine GTG-banding procedure. Slides were analyzed and pictures were
captured using a charge coupled device cooler camera and the software
Cytovision (Applied Imaging). Karyotypes were described according to the
International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (1995).
DNA profiling. Genomic DNA was extracted from the cell lines using
DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
followed by a multiplex PCR amplification of 1 to 2 ng of DNA with a
AmpFLSTR Identifier PCR Amplification kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR products were detected on 3130
ABI Prism and analyzed by Gene Mapper ID (Software v3.2, Applied
Biosystems).

Results
Cell lines cluster independently of their tumor of origin. We
investigated the gene expression of each cell line by hybridization
onto in-house–manufactured cDNA microarray slides. The quality
and reproducibility of our microarray data have been shown
previously (16). Gene expression profiles from the follicular
adenoma cell line KAK-1; the FTC cell lines FTC-133 and WRO;
the PTC cell lines B-CPAP, TPC-1, and KAT-10; and the ATC cell
lines KAT-4 and 8505C were made comparing each of the cell lines
with normal human thyrocytes from primary cultures. Hierarchical
clustering of these data showed a division into two groups: the cell
lines KAK-1, KAT-4, and KAT-10 clustered on one side, whereas
FTC-133, TPC-1, 8505C, B-CPAP, and WRO cells clustered in
another group (Fig. 1). Bootstrap analysis confirmed the stability of
the hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, the gene
expression profiles of cell lines derived from the same type of
thyroid tumor did not cluster together.
DNA profiling reveals a common origin for the KAT family
of cell lines. The tight clustering of KAK-1, KAT-4, and KAT-10,
originating from the same laboratory, indicates a high similarity
between these three cell lines despite the markedly higher number
of chromosomes of KAT-4 compared with KAK-1 and KAT-10 (see
below). Furthermore, the KAT family (KAK-1, KAT-4, and KAT-10)
shares a similar point mutation in E-cadherin, which is rare in
thyroid tumors. Additionally, they contain a heterozygous mutation
of B-RAFV600E that is exclusively found in PTCs and in some ATCs,
and they share a common genetic background (20). Our clustering
results and the findings reported by Rocha et al. (20) raised the
question about the exact tumor origin of these three cell lines. To
further identify the origin of all cell lines, DNA profiling was done
and showed that the cell lines were derived from six individuals,
with KAK-1, KAT-4, and KAT-10 originating from the same
individual (Supplementary Fig. S2). Additional DNA in KAT-4
indicates a contamination of this cell line by other cells. An

additional hierarchical clustering analysis, including individually
each cell line of the KAT family with the five other cell lines, did not
change the above results (i.e., gene expression profiles of cell lines
derived from the same type of thyroid tumor do not cluster
together; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Molecular profiles of cell lines are highly similar and closest
to undifferentiated in vivo thyroid cancers. The overall gene
expression profiles of the cell lines were compared with those of a
panel of in vivo solid tumors by multidimensional scaling (Fig. 2).
This algorithm reduces the high-dimension gene space into two
dimensions while preserving distances between the profiles, and
thereby visualizes the similarity relationships between samples.
The in vivo tumors span the different thyroid tumor pathologies:
two benign tumor types [a pool of five hyperfunctioning
autonomous adenomas (16) and one follicular adenoma] and
three malignant types: 1 FTC, 16 PTCs (17), and three undifferentiated ATCs.7 Analysis of the overall gene expression profiles
showed that cell lines derived from differentiated (FTC and PTC)
and undifferentiated (ATC) tumors grouped closely together and
were apart from the in vivo tumors. In vivo benign tumors
(autonomous adenomas and follicular adenoma) clustered closely
together but were very distant from the undifferentiated ATCs,
whereas PTCs and the FTC grouped in between benign tumors and
ATCs. The molecular profiles of the ATCs were the closest to those
of the cell lines (Fig. 2).
Cell lines have lost the expression of most of the thyroidspecific genes and do not respond to TSH. Thyrocytes are
differentiated cells that are characterized by the expression of a
number of genes that are involved in thyroid function. The
expression of a number of these markers is decreased or lost during
the process of thyroid tumorigenesis (21, 22). RT-PCR was done on
the cell lines to investigate the mRNA expression of the following
markers: TSHR, NIS, Tg, TPO, ThOX1, ThOX2, TTF1, TTF2, and
PAX8. PBGD, a housekeeping gene, was used to normalize mRNA
expression among the different samples (Fig. 3). RNA extracted
from a hyperfunctioning thyroid of a patient with Graves’ disease
was used as a positive control. The cell lines investigated have lost
the expression of most of the thyroid-specific markers, including
the TSHR, NIS, Tg, TPO, and ThOX2. A clear PBGD amplification product indicated the integrity of the cDNA obtained after
reverse transcription of the RNA isolated from each single sample.
Although ThOX2 could not be detected in any cell line, ThOX1 was
weakly detected in B-CPAP, KAT-4, and KAT-10. Among thyroidtranscription factors, the transcription factor PAX8 was found in
FTC-133, WRO, B-CPAP, TPC-1, and KAT-4. TTF1 was expressed
in all cell lines, and TTF2 was faintly detected in WRO, B-CPAP,
TPC-1, and KAT-10.
As the cell lines were cultured in the absence of TSH, which
could be responsible for partial loss of differentiation, we
investigated whether the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin could
induce the expression of thyroid-specific markers. The cell lines
were incubated with 10 Amol/L forskolin for 24 h, but in none of
the cell lines did this treatment induce any of the thyroid-specific
markers (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The lack of detection of the TSHR was further investigated by
treating the cell lines for 2 h with 1 mU/mL TSH or with 1 Amol/L
forskolin in the presence of the phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor
rolipram (25 Amol/L) followed by measurements of cAMP levels by
a RIA (Fig. 4). In none of the cell lines was an increase of the cAMP
content found after treatment with TSH. TSH-treated to control
ratios for all the cell lines were between 0.93 and 1.06. Incubation

with 10 mU/mL TSH gave similar ratios (not shown). In contrast,
incubation with forskolin strongly increased cAMP levels in all
cell lines, varying from a 5.2-fold ( for B-CPAP) to a 2,084-fold ( for
KAT-10) increase versus the control (Fig. 4).
Other groups have investigated the expression of thyroid-specific
markers in some thyroid cell lines and have reported similar
results, but also some discrepancies (2, 3, 7, 8, 23, 24). In particular,
the detection of the TSHR varied considerably between groups.
Different experimental conditions, such as the number of PCR
cycles used or, in the case of Western blot analysis, a difference in
exposure time of the membrane (24), may account for some
discrepancies. However, an increase in the number of PCR cycles
from 30 to 35 did not result in the detection of the TSHR in any of
the eight cell lines (not shown).
Cell lines show a down-regulation of differentiation genes.
The differentiation status of the cell lines was further explored by
comparing their gene expression profiles with those of differentiated cells: human primary cultured thyrocytes treated with TSH for
1.5 to 48 h, and with those of autonomous adenomas, highly
differentiated benign thyroid tumors (Fig. 5; ref. 16). For the
analysis, up-regulated genes in the differentiated cells were selected
(Fig. 5); that is, up-regulated (log2 ratio > 1) at least at one time
point after TSH treatment and which had a positive value (log2
ratio > 0) in autonomous adenomas (16). From the total of these
66 up-regulated genes, 14 genes had an average positive value in
the cell lines (21%), whereas 52 genes had a negative value in the
cell lines (78%).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

From the data in Fig. 5, we found, as might be expected, that the
genes that were up-regulated in the differentiated thyrocytes and in
the cell lines such as PPIF and EFHD2 are more likely involved in
proliferation, whereas the genes up-regulated in the primary
cultured thyrocytes but down-regulated in the cell lines are more
likely involved in differentiation. Examples of such genes are DIO2,
ITPR1, CRABP1, and WARS (Fig. 5).
Cell lines have abnormal chromosome numbers and
structures. Thyroid tumors have been associated with chromosome abnormalities and gains and losses of chromosomes have
been described, indicating that FTCs and ATCs are genetically less
stable compared with PTCs (25). Karyotypes were determined for
all the cell lines using GTG banding (Fig. 6). Numerical and
structural anomalies were observed for the cell lines. The FTC cell
lines FTC-133 and WRO karyograms had 62 to 71 and 68 to 77
chromosomes, respectively. The PTC cell lines B-CPAP and TPC-1
had 72 to 73 and 49 chromosomes, respectively. The ATC cell line
8505C contained 60 to 62 chromosomes. The karyograms of the
KAT family showed 60 to 67 chromosomes (KAK-1), 63 to 68
chromosomes (KAT-10), and around 100 chromosomes (KAT-4;
Fig. 6). The karyotype of KAT-4 is not shown because the large
number of chromosome abnormalities precluded a reliable
classification. Cell lines were hyperdiploid (TPC-1), hypotriploid
(KAK-1, KAT-10, 8505C), hypertriploid (FTC-133, WRO, B-CPAP), or
hypertetraploid (KAT-4). All karyograms were structurally abnormal and, except for TPC-1, included several unidentifiable markers
(chromosomes) indicated by ‘‘A’’ in Fig. 6.
From the cell lines used in this study, to our knowledge, a
karyotype description has been reported only for the cell lines FTC133, B-CPAP, and WRO (7, 26, 27). Extensive cytogenetics studies on
the B-CPAP cell line (27) were recently reported. The karyotype we
obtained is 72,XX,-X, i(1)(p10), i(5)(p10), der(5)t(5;9)(p10;p10),
der(8)t(5;8)(q13;p22-23), der(10)t(1;10)(q10;q10)del(1)(q21q32),

between previously reported and present karyotypes concerned
numerical and structural alterations: Particularly, dic(5;13)
(q10;q10) was not recovered. For the WRO cell line, the initial
chromosomal pattern (7) with 62 to 82 chromosomes and five
markers was strikingly different from the pattern we obtained.

Discussion
Tumor cell lines are used as models for the process of
tumorigenesis. However, before using a cell line as a model for
the corresponding in vivo tumor, it should be verified whether
the properties of the in vivo tumor investigated are still represented in vitro. Our results on thyroid tumor–derived cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

show that (a) gene expression profiles of thyroid cell lines
originating from tumors of the same histological type or from
different types are closely related to each other; (b) the expression profiles of cell lines from various origins resemble each other
more than in vivo tumors; (c) they are closer to those of
undifferentiated carcinomas; (d) the cell lines show characteristics of dedifferentiated cells because they have lost the expression of most thyroid-specific genes, have a down-regulation of
most genes that are up-regulated in differentiated cells, do not
respond to their physiologic stimulus (TSH), and have strongly
disturbed karyotypes; (e) comparison of gene expression profiles
of cell lines with differentiated thyroid cells provides insight
into the genes involved in the process of differentiation/dedifferentiation.
Contrary to expectation, cell lines derived from the same type of
cancer origin do not cluster together. The two FTC cell lines do not
cluster together, and neither do the PTC cell lines. Indeed,
correlation coefficients between gene expression profiles of cell
lines derived from a similar pathology are not the highest inside
the cell line group (Supplementary Table S2). Furthermore, cell
lines are not closer to in vivo tumors of the same pathologic
origin. This might be explained in part by the fact that in vitro
conditions are compared with an in vivo environment, and,
moreover, homogeneous cell populations (cell lines) are compared with heterogeneous populations (tissues). Solid tumors
have a complex histologic organization with transformed thyrocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, blood cells, and sometimes
with lymphocyte infiltrates, all interacting with each other (28).
Interestingly, comparison of the gene expression profiles of the
cell lines with another homogeneous cell population (i.e., primary cultured autonomous adenoma cells) shows that they are
not correlated (Supplementary Table S2). In contrast, the cell
lines are better correlated to the in vivo tumors and have the
highest correlation with ATCs, undifferentiated, and rapid growing tumors (Supplementary Table S2). If the separation of cell
lines from the differentiated tumors would only be due to in vitro/
in vivo differences, all the tissues should be closer to each other
than to cell lines and all the cell lines should be closer to primary cultured autonomous adenoma cells than to in vivo tissues,
which is not observed (Supplementary Table S2). On the contrary,
in vivo benign thyroid tumors are closer to cultured cells of
autonomous adenomas and more distant from in vivo undifferentiated cancers than the latter from cell lines (Supplementary
Table S2).
The observation that all the cell lines are closer to each other
and closer to the undifferentiated than to the differentiated tumors
suggests that they have evolved into a common fully dedifferentiated phenotype and have lost many of their original characteristics. Indeed, our data support this hypothesis. In all thyroid tumor
cell lines, the expression of most of the thyroid-specific genes was
completely lost and could not be restored after forskolin treatment.
Along the accepted dedifferentiation pathway of thyroid tumors,
from the benign adenomas, to the differentiated FTCs and PTCs,
and the undifferentiated ATCs, NIS and TPO expression are lost
first, followed by Tg expression, whereas TSHR expression is lost
only in the ATCs (21, 22). ThOX expression is normal or slightly
increased in the carcinomas (29). Thus, the cell lines correspond to
the maximal dedifferentiation stage in vivo.
The findings on the chromosome analysis are in line with
the dedifferentiated status of the cell lines. Our results did not
show any similarity with chromosomal anomalies reported in

published ones (7, 26, 27) that suggest an in vitro evolution of
the cell lines, as do the differences in gene expressions (i.e., EGR1
and FOS) between KAK-1 and KAT-10, which have the same
origin. Such irreversible differences might be explained by subclone selection in long-term cultures, as shown for melanoma
(30) and in pituitary cell line cultures (31). They cannot be
explained by the loss of in vivo cell heterogeneity or differences
of microenvironment.

In addition to the lack of expression of various differentiation
and determination markers in the cell lines, and to their disturbed
karyotypes, several of them have inactivated p53 (32–34) and
activated nuclear factor-nB (1) contrary to differentiated tumors;
that is, they have progressed in vitro toward a genotype closer to
ATCs (35). It is interesting in this respect that Castedo et al. (36)
have shown that in the presence of active p53, tetraploid cells,
precursors of aneuploid cells, die. Thus, it is probable that the loss
of p53 has been a necessary step in the in vitro evolution to
aneuploidy in cell lines derived from PTCs.
The expression of transcription factors (TTF1, TTF2, PAX8) is
altered or reduced in thyroid tumors, in particular in poorly
differentiated tumors (22). It is interesting to note that some of the

Tumor Cell Lines as In vitro Models

cell lines still express the three transcription factors but do not
express Tg or TPO, the expressions of which are regulated by these
factors. This might be explained by the fact that the expression of
these transcription factors is decreased, because their overexpression induces expression of thyroglobulin as previously
shown for WRO (37) and also, as shown by the sequence of gene
expression in embryos, that other factor(s) are probably necessary
(38). Thus, the cell lines retain the expression of thyroidtranscription factors, suggesting that they have lost the expression
of their differentiation but not completely their thyroid determination. As discussed later, they retain some of their original
characteristics.
Dedifferentiation is characterized by a loss of specific markers
and a subsequent gain of proliferative capacity. Tumor-derived
immortal cell lines have a much higher proliferation rate than the
in vivo differentiated thyroid tumors. Among the genes overexpressed in all cell lines, we found genes encoding proteins involved
in general metabolism, cell cycle, and proliferation (e.g., PRIM1,
RPA1, HMGB2, CNAP1, RRM1, HMGN2, PCNT1, SLC1A5, RPS23,
TOP2A). Genes involved in immune recognition (e.g., CD200, HLADRA, HLA-DQB1, CDA08) were down-regulated (Supplementary
Table S3). In addition to the well-defined thyrocyte markers as
described above, we further investigated the dedifferentiated status
of the cell lines by comparing gene expression profiles of
differentiated thyrocytes both from normal thyrocytes treated with
TSH in vitro and from autonomous adenomas in vivo (16). We
reasoned that genes regulated in common in both differentiated
thyrocytes and cell lines might be involved in cell proliferation,
whereas inversely regulated genes would be involved in differentiation/dedifferentiation. Genes that are related to specific thyroid
function, such as CRABP1, DIO2, VAPA, WARS, and MACF1 (16), are
underexpressed in all the cell lines as they are in thyroid
carcinogenesis in vivo (14, 39, 40). This approach of comparing
differentiated cells with cell lines might have useful applications in
tumor types from other origin, because the process of dedifferentiation is common in most tumor types and a major determinant of
their evolution into highly aggressive tumors. It may lead to the
identification of new diagnostic markers and/or therapeutic targets.
Although part of the difference with in vivo tumors could be
explained by loss of tissue heterogeneity and microenvironment
differences, our results thus suggest that the cell lines have evolved
into dedifferentiated cells, which might explain that their gene
expression profiles are very distinct from in vivo differentiated
tumors but are closer to undifferentiated carcinomas and are
closer to each other. This evolution is confirmed by several other
facts: the aneuploidy, the generality of p53-inactivating mutations,
both irreversible, and the complete loss of expression of
differentiation genes in all the cell lines but not in FTCs or PTCs
in vivo. Moreover, CpG island methylation of promoters is higher in
cell lines than in differentiated carcinomas, and such profiles are
different between different types of carcinomas and between these
and their derived cell lines (41). This does not imply that the cell
lines have lost all the characteristics of the original cancers; for

example, they retain the causal oncogenic event BRAF activation
for the B-CPAP cell line (42) and RET/PTC1 rearrangement for the
TPC-1 cells (43), as well as the expression of thyroid-specific
transcription factors. They are, however, largely different and thus
not valid models of the original differentiated tumor but when
validated for a given property could be used as models for
undifferentiated cancer.
The literature also shows that gene expression profiles from cell
lines derived from cancers of other solid tissues, such as breast,
lung, and brain, are separated from the tumor of origin, which is,
however, little commented upon (28, 44–47). Breast cancers cluster
separately from breast cancer–derived cell lines and from cultured
human mammary epithelial cells (47). In another study, breast
cancer– and leukemia-derived cell lines cluster in one group, again
apart from breast cancer and normal breast tissues, which cluster
together in a second group (28). Thus, the congruence of gene
expression patterns from cell lines originating from different tumor
types of the same tissue is far greater than the differences of
expression that still allow distinguishing cell lines of different
origins. Interestingly, although breast cancer cell lines are
separated from in vivo tumors, it has been shown that they do
cluster according to the cell type from which they originate (i.e.,
basal, luminal, and stromal-like groups; ref. 48); however, in
contrast, this is not shown for lung cancer cell lines (44). A metaanalysis on the NCI60 panel of cell lines and a large number of
in vivo tumors derived from various origins showed that the cell
lines group together despite their different originating tissues (49).
The evolution of the cell lines from the in vivo tumors could have
several, not necessarily exclusive, explanations: Cell lines could
result from an in vitro selection of a fraction of cancer stem cells,
from an adaptation to the in vitro environment or from an in vitro
Darwinian selection by this new environment. The latter explanation is supported by the very different evolution of glioma cells
depending on the presence of serum in the medium (50) by the
long-term history of the cells, the changed karyotypes, and the
expression of genes related to proliferation instead of differentiation. A role of an adaptation to another microenvironment is
supported by the striking change in gene expression taking place
when a cell line generates a xenograft (50).
