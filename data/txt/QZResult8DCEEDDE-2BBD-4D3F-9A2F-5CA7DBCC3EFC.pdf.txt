Abstract
Aminoflavone (AF), the active component of a novel anticancer agent (AFP464) in phase I clinical trials, is a
ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR dimerizes with HIF-1β/AhR, which is shared with HIF-1α,
a transcription factor critical for the response of cells to oxygen deprivation. To address whether pharmacologic activation of the AhR pathway might be a potential mechanism for inhibition of HIF-1, we tested the
effects of AF on HIF-1 expression. AF inhibited HIF-1α transcriptional activity and protein accumulation in
MCF-7 cells. However, inhibition of HIF-1α by AF was independent from a functional AhR pathway. Indeed, AF
inhibited HIF-1α expression in AhR100 cells, in which the AhR pathway is functionally impaired, yet did not
induce cytotoxicity, providing evidence that these effects are mediated by distinct signaling pathways. Moreover, AF was inactive in MDA-MB-231 cells, yet inhibited HIF-1α in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the
SULT1A1 gene. AF inhibited HIF-1α mRNA expression by ∼50%. Notably, actinomycin-D completely abrogated
the ability of AF to downregulate HIF-1α mRNA, indicating that active transcription was required for the
inhibition of HIF-1α expression. Finally, AF inhibited HIF-1α protein accumulation and the expression of
HIF-1 target genes in MCF-7 xenografts. These results show that AF inhibits HIF-1α in an AhR-independent
fashion, and they unveil additional activities of AF that may be relevant for its further clinical development.

Introduction
Hypoxia, a decrease in oxygen levels, is a hallmark of solid
tumors. The response of mammalian cells to hypoxia is mediated, at least in part, by a family of transcription factors
known as hypoxia inducible factors (HIF; ref. 1). HIF-1 is a
heterodimer consisting of a constitutively expressed β subunit and an oxygen regulated α subunit (2), which is ubiquitinated and degraded under normoxic conditions (3). In
contrast, under hypoxic conditions, the HIF-α subunit is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus, in which it dimerizes
with HIF-1β (also known as AhR nuclear translocator) and

activates the transcription of genes involved in key steps of
tumorigenesis, including angiogenesis, metabolism, proliferation, metastasis, and differentiation (4). Overexpression of
HIF-α has been reported in >70% of human cancers (5–11)
and is associated with poor patient prognosis, making
HIF-1 an attractive target for the development of novel cancer
therapeutics (12).
Aminoflavone (AF; NSC 686288) is the active component of
a prodrug (AFP464) in phase I clinical trials. AFP464 is rapidly converted to AF, in plasma or tissue culture, by nonspecific plasma esterases. AF has a unique COMPARE pattern of
cytotoxicity in the NCI60 (13, 14), with activity only in a subset of cell lines, including MCF-7 breast cancer cells (15–18).
The sensitivity of cancer cell lines to AF has been associated
with its ability to act as a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which upon dimerization with HIF-1β/AhR nuclear translocator activates transcription by binding to the
xenobiotic response element (XRE) in the promoters of
target genes, including but not limited to cytochrome P450
1A1 (CYP1A1). Indeed, the presence of a functional AhR
pathway and the induction of CYP1A1 expression by AF seem
to be essential for its antiproliferative activity in MCF-7
cells (18–20).
Several studies have suggested the existence of a cross-talk
between the AhR and HIF-1 pathways (21–26). However,
whether pharmacologic activation of the AhR pathway may
be a viable approach to inhibit HIF-1 remains poorly understood. We show that AF inhibits HIF-1α expression, both
in vitro and in MCF-7 xenografts, in an AhR-independent

fashion. Notably, AF partially inhibited HIF-1α mRNA expression, yet almost completely blocked HIF-1α protein accumulation. The ability of actinomycin-D to completely revert
inhibition of HIF-1α mRNA expression by AF is consistent
with the existence of a transcription-dependent pathway that
may regulate HIF-1α mRNA expression and its translation.

Real-time PCR
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), HIF-1α, p21,
CA9, LOX, actin, and CYP1A1 expression was measured by
real-time PCR as previously described (30). Primers and probes
used are listed in Supplementary Table S1 and Table 1. VEGF
primers and probe were previously described (30). 18S rRNA
was used as an internal control.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Human cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and grown at 37°C in 5% CO2 and
ambient oxygen (normoxia). Hypoxia was achieved in an
Invivo2 400 hypoxic workstation (Ruskinn Technology) delivering 1% oxygen in 5% CO2 at 37°C. AhR-deficient MCF-7
cells (AhR100 ; ref. 27) were kindly provided by Dr. David
Vistica [STB, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Frederick, MD].
MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with a SULT1A1 cDNA,
MDA/SULT1A1 (28), were kindly provided by Dr. David C.
Spink, (Wadsworth Center, Albany, NY). All cell lines were obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program and
were validated according to information provided on the Developmental Therapeutics Program Web site (http://dtp.nci.
nih.gov/branches/btb/characterizationNCI60.html). AF (NSC
686288) was from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch,
Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI.
Sulforhodamine B assay
Cells, seeded into 96-well plates, were treated with AF for
an additional 72 hours, and cell viability was assessed as previously described (29).
Immunoblot analysis
Total protein lysates were obtained as previously described (30). Antibodies used are as follows: HIF-1α and
p21 (BD- Transduction Laboratories); HIF-1β, SULT1A1,
HIF-2α, and AhR (Novus Biologicals); actin (Chemicon International); and γH2AX (Cell Signaling, Inc.).

HIF-1α protein translational assay
MCF-7 cells, treated for 12 hours with AF (0.25 μmol/L),
were labeled with 35S-methionine/cysteine (MP Biomedicals)
as previously described (31). Total 35S incorporation was
monitored by both size fractionation of total lysates and
TCA precipitation.
Luciferase activity
MCF-7 cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen)
with pGL2-TK-HRE, pGL3-control (30), NF-κB-Luc, activator protein (AP-1)-luc (supplied by Dr. Nancy Colburn,
NCI, Frederick, MD), and XRE-Luc (supplied by Dr. F.J.
Gonzalez, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Efficiency of transfection was assessed by cotransfection with pQTK-Renilla
(Promega). Results are expressed as fold increase of luciferase levels relative to normoxic nontreated controls.
Transfection with small interfering RNA for HIF-1α,
SULT1A1, and AhR
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting SULT1A1 (s5′-CAGAGGGAGTGTGCGAATCAA), AhR (5′-TTGGATTAAATTAGTTTGTGA), HIF-1α (5′-AGGACAAGTCACCACAGGA),
and negative control were purchased from Qiagen.
Animal studies
Studies were conducted in a facility that is accredited by
the Association of Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care with an approved animal protocol. MCF-7
cells (1 × 107) were injected s.c. into the flank of female
athymic nude (NCr/nu) mice (Animal Production Area,
NCI, Frederick, MD). β-Estradiol cypionate (3 mg/kg) was

Inhibition of HIF-1α by Aminoflavone

administered i.m. every 7 days. Tumor size was determined
by collecting length and width measurements, and calculating the tumor weight (mg) as [tumor length × (tumor
width)2]/2, in which the tumor length is the longest dimension (mm) and the tumor width is the narrowest dimension (mm). AF (saline/0.05% Tween 80) was dosed i.p.
Five mice per group were treated daily for 4 days with
AF (60 mg/kg) or vehicle control. When mice were sacrificed (day 4), tumors from each animal were harvested
and used to analyze mRNA and protein expression, as previously described (32).
Tissue HIF-1α assay
Tissue lysates were prepared as previously described (32)
and used for the quantitative determination of HIF-1α using
electrochemiluminescence assay (Meso-Scale). HIF-1α concentration (pg/mL) was determined using a recombinant
protein (R&D Systems) as standard.
Statistical analysis
Results are either representative or average of at least three
independent experiments done. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA test and t test (Prism, GraphPad).

Results
AF inhibits HIF-1α transcriptional activity in MCF-7
breast cancer cells
To test whether AF inhibited HIF-1 activity, MCF-7 cells
were transiently transfected either with pGL2-TK-HRE, containing the luciferase reporter gene under control of three
copies of a hypoxia response element (HRE) or with a control
vector (pGL3 control). Hypoxia increased HRE-dependent
luciferase expression by 49-fold, relative to cells cultured under normoxic conditions (Fig. 1A, left). AF inhibited luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner, but did not
affect constitutive luciferase expression (Fig. 1A, right), suggesting that inhibition of luciferase by AF was HIF-1 dependent. AF also inhibited endogenous HIF-1 transcriptional
activity, as indicated by inhibition of hypoxic induction of
VEGF (Fig. 1B, left), CA9, and LOX mRNA expression (Fig.
1B, right), similar to the effects of siRNA targeting HIF-1α.
In contrast, AF caused up to 40-fold increase of p21 mRNA
expression, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions
(Fig. 1C, left), indicating that AF differentially affects gene
expression in MCF-7 cells.
Notably, neither NF-κB–dependent (Fig. 1D, left) nor AP1–dependent transcriptional activities (right) were inhibited
by AF, further showing that AF specifically inhibits HIF-1.
AF inhibits HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein accumulation
in a cell type–dependent fashion
To address whether AF inhibited HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein accumulation, we tested six cell lines from the NCI60 panel that were reported to be sensitive to AF. Hypoxia increased
HIF-1α protein expression in all the cell lines examined,
whereas HIF-2α was induced to detectable levels in three cell
lines (T47D, CAKI, and UACC257). AF (0.5 μmol/L) inhibited

www.aacrjournals.org

HIF-1α protein accumulation, albeit to a different extent, in
MCF-7, T47D, CAKI, and OVCAR3. In contrast, HIF-2α was
slightly decreased by AF in T47D and CAKI cells but not in
UACC257 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that AF inhibits HIF-1α and
HIF-2α protein accumulation in a cell type–specific fashion,
although HIF-2α seems to be slightly less susceptible to AF
inhibition, relative to HIF-1α.
Further experiments showed that AF inhibited HIF-1α
protein accumulation in MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent
fashion, with ∼80% decrease at 0.25 μmol/L (Fig. 2B). By contrast, HIF-1β was only inhibited by 15%, and actin levels were
not changed in the presence of up to 1 μmol/L of AF. Kinetic
experiments showed that AF (0.25 μmol/L) caused little or no
inhibition of HIF-1α protein at 8 hours, but completely abrogated its accumulation after 12 to 24 hours of treatment
(Fig. 2C). AF also inhibited HIF-1α protein accumulation induced by the iron chelator desferrioxamine (100 μmol/L;
Fig. 2D), suggesting that its effects are not restricted to hypoxic signaling. By contrast, AF induced p21 protein accumulation in MCF-7 cells cultured under either normoxia (data
not shown) or hypoxia (Fig. 1C, right), consistent with the
induction of p21 mRNA expression and showing a differential
effect on distinct target proteins.
A functional AhR pathway is not required for the
inhibition of HIF-1α expression by AF
Previous studies have indicated that AF is a ligand of
AhR (18). Indeed, AF caused a 7- to 8-fold increase in
XRE-dependent luciferase expression (Fig. 3A) and induced
up to 200-fold higher levels of CYP1A1 mRNA expression in
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3B), showing that AF was able to induce
AhR-dependent transcriptional activity. TCDD, used as positive control, induced a 15-fold increase in XRE-dependent
luciferase expression (Fig. 3A) and up to 1,160-fold higher
levels of CYP1A1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3B), relative to
nontreated cells.
To address whether inhibition of HIF-1α by AF required a
functional AhR pathway, we took advantage of AhR100 cells,
MCF-7–derived cells that express low levels of AhR and are
resistant to the cytotoxic effects of AF (18). Indeed, AF caused
cytotoxicity in parental MCF-7 cells but not in AhR100 cells,
even at concentrations as high as 2 μmol/L (Fig. 3C). Consistent with a functional impairment of the AhR pathway, TCDD
induction of XRE-dependent luciferase expression was decreased by 75% in AhR100 cells, relative to parental MCF-7
cells, and induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression was decreased by 95% (Fig. 3A and B). More importantly, AF failed
to induce XRE-dependent luciferase expression in AhR100 cells
and only modestly induced CYP1A1 mRNA expression (35%
of the levels induced in wild-type MCF-7 cells; Fig. 3A and B).
However, AF inhibited hypoxic induction of HIF-1 transcriptional activity irrespective of a functional AhR, as shown by
the inhibition of HRE-dependent luciferase expression in
MCF-7 and AhR100 cells (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, AF also completely inhibited hypoxic induction of HIF-1α protein accumulation in AhR100 cells (Fig. 3E), showing that inhibition of
HIF-1α expression by AF is independent from a functional
AhR pathway.

Inhibition of HIF-1α by Aminoflavone

AF inhibits HIF-1α in MDA/SULT1A1, but not in
MDA-MB-231 parental breast cancer cells
The restricted spectrum of AF activity in the NCI60 cells
has been attributed to a requirement for its intracellular
activation (18) by pathway(s) yet to be completely elucidated.
A potential correlation between sensitivity to AF and expression of SULT1A1 has also been suggested, consistent with the
ability of SULT1A1 to induce the formation of AF metabolites
that mediate DNA damage (33). Indeed, AF exerted antiproliferative effects in MDA/SULT1A1, but not in MDA-MB-231
parental cells (Fig. 3C). However, both MDA-MB-231 and
MDA/SULT1A1 cells express little or no AhR transcriptional
activity, as indicated by minimal if any induction of XREdependent luciferase (Fig. 3A) or CYP1A1 mRNA expression
by either AF or TCDD (Fig. 3B).
We then tested whether AF inhibited HIF-1 transcriptional
activity in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-SULT1A1 cells. AF completely inhibited HIF-1–dependent luciferase expression in
MDA/SULT1A1, but did not affect its expression in MDAMB-231 parental cells, showing that exogenous expression of
SULT1A1 was sufficient to mediate AF-dependent inhibition of

HIF-1 activity (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, AF almost completely inhibited hypoxic induction of HIF-1α protein in MDA/SULT1A1
cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 3E).
Next, we evaluated expression of HIF-1α in MCF-7 cells
transfected with either negative control siRNA or siRNA targeting SULT1A1 or AhR (Supplementary Fig. S2A-B). AF inhibited hypoxic induction of HIF-1α protein by 75% in cells
transfected with negative control siRNA and by 50% in cells
transfected with AhR siRNA, relative to hypoxia-treated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In contrast, downregulation
of SULT1A1 almost completely prevented the inhibition of
HIF-1α by AF (15% inhibition, compared with hypoxia; Supplementary Fig. S2B), showing that SULT1A1 expression was
implicated in HIF-1α inhibition by AF and further supporting
the conclusion that inhibition of HIF-1α by AF is independent from a functional AhR pathway.
Inhibition of HIF-1α by AF is independent from
DNA damage
Induction of DNA damage by AF, measured by phosphorylation of H2AX, paralleled results obtained in cytotoxicity assay.

Indeed, AF induced significantly higher levels of γH2AX in sensitive MCF-7 and MDA/SULT1A1 cells than in resistant AhR100
and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3E). However, AF was equally able
to inhibit hypoxic induction of HIF-1α protein in AhR100 and

induction of DNA damage and HIF-1α inhibition (Fig. 3E).

We have previously shown that agents that inhibit topoisomerase I or II may affect HIF-1α protein translation
(31, 34). Consistent with the finding that induction of DNA
damage by AF does not seem to involve topoisomerases
(35), AF was able to inhibit HIF-1α protein expression in
cells transfected with siRNA targeting topo I or topo IIα

Inhibition of HIF-1α by Aminoflavone

(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Furthermore, AF inhibited the
hypoxic induction of HIF-1α protein accumulation in the
presence of aphidicolin, which blocks DNA polymerase
and prevents DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. S4), further
showing that AF inhibited HIF-1α by a DNA damage–
independent pathway.
AF does not affect HIF-1α degradation, but decreases
the rate of HIF-1α translation
HIF-1α steady-state is the result of a balance between protein translation and its degradation. To investigate whether
AF affected HIF-1α degradation, we performed experiments
in the presence of inhibitors of either proteasome activity
(MG-132) or prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (DMOG, a global inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenase enzymes),
which cause an accumulation of HIF-1α under normoxic
conditions. As shown in Fig. 4A, AF inhibited HIF-1α protein
accumulation regardless of inhibition of the proteasome or
prolyl hydroxylases, suggesting that AF did not affect degradation of HIF-1α protein. Consistent with these results, AF

also inhibited normoxic accumulation of HIF-2α in a sensitive Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)–deficient renal cancer cell line
(A498, which does not express HIF-1α), indicating that a
functional VHL pathway, essential for normoxic degradation
of the HIF-α subunit, is not required for the inhibition of
HIF-α by AF (Fig. 4B). Finally, experiments conducted in
the presence of cycloheximide failed to show significant differences in HIF-1α protein half-life between cells cultured in
the absence or presence of AF (half-life ∼60 min; Fig. 4C).
Taken together, these results show that AF does not affect
HIF-1α protein degradation.
We then assessed whether AF inhibited HIF-1α translation
by evaluating the rate of HIF-1α protein synthesis in normoxic MCF-7 cells in the absence or presence of AF. Cells
were pulse labeled with [35S] methionine for 60 minutes at
which point HIF-1α was immunoprecipitated and analyzed
by PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4D (left),
AF significantly decreased 35S-labeled HIF-1α accumulation
relative to nontreated cells, suggesting that it may affect its
rate of translation. Importantly, under the same experimental

Figure 4. AF does not affect HIF-1α protein half-life but decreases its translation. A, MCF-7 cells were cultured, in the absence or presence of AF (0.25 μmol/L),
either under hypoxia or in the presence of MG132 (20 μmol/L) or DMOG (100 μmol/L) for 16 h. HIF-1α and actin levels were analyzed. B, A498 cells were
treated for 16 h with AF (0.25 μmol/L) under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, and HIF-2α and actin levels were assessed. C, MCF-7 cells were cultured
under hypoxia in the absence or presence of AF (0.25 μmol/L) for 12 h (time 0), when CHX (40 μg/mL) was added for the indicated times. HIF-1α levels were
quantified by densitometry (bottom). Values were normalized to the expression of actin and expressed as percentage relative to time 0 (arbitrarily considered
equal to 100%). D, MCF-7 cells were treated under normoxic conditions in the absence or presence of AF (0.25 μmol/L) for 12 h. Newly synthesized
HIF-1α and HIF-1β levels (left) were assessed as described in Materials and Methods. Total incorporation of 35S (right) from TCA-precipitated cellular proteins
was measured as an indication of total protein synthesis.

levels of HIF-1α mRNA may be a crucial factor affecting the
rate of HIF-1α translation (36). AF, under hypoxic but not normoxic conditions, caused a 50% decrease of HIF-1α mRNA expression, relative to normoxic cells (P = 0.005; Fig. 5A). Next, to
address whether AF inhibited HIF-1α mRNA transcription, we
measured the levels of HIF-1α pre-mRNA. Unexpectedly, we
found that hypoxia induced up to 5.8-fold higher levels of

Inhibition of HIF-1α by Aminoflavone

HIF-1α pre-mRNA, relative to normoxic cells (Fig. 5B). Notably, despite the increase of HIF-1α pre-mRNA under hypoxic
conditions, which was confirmed using a different set of primers (data not shown), hypoxia only marginally affected the
levels of HIF-1α mRNA, suggesting possible abnormalities in
HIF-1α mRNA maturation and/or processing. AF did not affect HIF-1α pre-mRNA expression under normoxic conditions,
yet reduced the hypoxic induction to levels 2-3-fold higher
than those present in normoxic cells.
To further address the mechanism by which AF affected
HIF-1α mRNA levels, we performed experiments in the presence of actinomycin-D, an inhibitor of transcription. We
found that hypoxic induction of HIF-1α pre-mRNA, both in
the absence and presence of AF, was completely abrogated
by addition of actinomycin-D (Fig. 5D), showing that it was
dependent on active transcription. Surprisingly, we also
found that inhibition of mature HIF-1α mRNA expression
by AF, observed in hypoxic cells, was completely reversed
by addition of actinomycin-D, showing that induction rather
than inhibition of transcription is required for HIF-1α mRNA
downregulation in the presence of AF (Fig. 5C). Consistent
with these results, addition of actinomycin-D also partially
reversed the inhibitory effect of AF on HIF-1α protein accumulation (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that the effects
on HIF-1α mRNA expression were causally related to the inhibition of HIF-1α protein.
Taken together, these results show that active transcription, in hypoxic cells treated with AF, is required for the inhibition of HIF-1α mRNA expression.
AF inhibits HIF-1α expression in MCF-7 xenografts
To test whether AF was able to inhibit HIF-1α expression
in tumor xenografts, MCF-7 cells were implanted s.c. in female athymic nude mice. When tumors reached ∼200 mg,
mice (n = 5/group) were randomized to receive either vehicle
control or AF (60 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 4 days. As shown in
Fig. 6A, AF exerted a cytostatic effect on tumor growth
(P < 0.01), relative to vehicle-treated mice. Notably, AF inhibited HIF-1α protein accumulation in tumor lysates by 90%
(P < 0.005), relative to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6B) and
mRNA expression of the HIF-1 target genes VEGF, CA9, and
PDK-1 by ∼ 70% (P < 0.05; Fig. 6C), showing that AF inhibits
HIF-1α expression and activity in MCF-7 xenografts.
Because of the potentially confounding effects of tumor size
on HIF-1α expression, we also conducted experiments in
which MCF-7 tumor–bearing animals were only treated for
2 days with either vehicle control or AF (120 mg/kg, i.p.). As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, AF did not affect tumor
growth under these conditions, yet it significantly inhibited
HIF-1α protein accumulation and VEGF mRNA expression
(Supplementary Fig. S6B and C, respectively), suggesting that
inhibition of HIF-1α and HIF-1 target genes by AF is independent from its cytostatic/cytotoxic activity.

Discussion
HIF-1 has emerged over the last several years as an attractive target for the development of novel cancer therapeutics.

www.aacrjournals.org

We and others have identified small-molecule inhibitors of
HIF-1α that act by distinct mechanisms of action, including,
but not limited to, inhibition of HIF-1α translation (31, 34,
37, 38), inhibition of HIF-1 DNA binding (39) or transcriptional activity (40–42), inhibition of protein-protein interaction (43), increased protein degradation (44, 45), or inhibition
of mitochondrial respiration (46). Several HIF-1 inhibitors
identified at the NCI share the property of inducing DNA
damage, including topotecan (30) and NSC 644221 (34),
although DNA damage and HIF-1 inhibition seem to be concomitant but independent events.
AF induces DNA damage and acts as a ligand of AhR. AF
exerts antiproliferative activity in a fairly limited number of
human cancer cell lines, and activation of AhR seems to be
required for its conversion to DNA-damaging species, at
least in part, by transcriptional activation of CYP1A1 and
SULT1A1, two XRE target genes (18). In this article, we provide evidence that AF inhibits HIF-1α expression in MCF-7
cells in an AhR-independent fashion, as indicated by the following results: (a) AF inhibited HIF-1α protein accumulation in MCF-7 and Ah R 1 0 0 cells, in which the AhR
pathway is functionally impaired; (b) AF did not inhibit
HIF-1α in the resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells,
yet it did in MDA/SULT1A1, MDA-MB-231 cells transfected
with SULT1A1; and (c) siRNA targeting SULT1A1 significantly blocked the ability of AF to inhibit HIF-1α in
MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Along with the ability
of AF to exert antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 and MDASULT1A1, but not in AhR100 or MDA-MB-231, these results
suggest that (a) inhibition of HIF-1α by AF is independent
from a functional AhR pathway, and (b) there is no correlation between cytotoxicity and HIF-1α inhibition. Indeed,
AF was completely ineffective in inducing antiproliferative
effects in AhR100 cells, yet it was able to inhibit HIF-1α expression. In addition, AF induced significantly lower levels
of γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, in AhR100 and MDAMB-231 cells, which did not correlate with its ability to
inhibit HIF-1α. These results not only show a dissociation
between cytotoxicity and HIF-1 inhibition, but they also
raise the possibility that cancer cells found to be “resistant”
to the cytotoxic effects of AF may be sensitive to HIF-1α
inhibition.
A significant number of small-molecule inhibitors of HIF1α identified thus far seems to affect HIF-1 translation (31,
34, 37, 38), yet regulation of HIF-1α translation under hypoxic
conditions is still poorly understood. We were then intrigued
by the fact that AF also seemed to inhibit HIF-1α synthesis.
Further experiments showed that AF inhibited HIF-1α mRNA
expression by ∼50%, under hypoxic, but not normoxic
conditions. The magnitude of HIF-1α mRNA inhibition was
unlikely to account for the almost complete inhibition of
HIF-1α protein accumulation, raising the possibility that additional mechanisms were implicated. Using primers that
specifically detect HIF-1α pre-mRNA, we discovered that
hypoxia (in the absence or presence or AF) induced higher
levels of transcript, relative to normoxic cells. The increased
levels of HIF-1α pre-mRNA did not seem to correlate with
the decreased expression of HIF-1α mRNA in the presence

Figure 6. AF inhibits HIF-1α expression and transcriptional activity in MCF-7 xenografts. A, MCF-7 cells were implanted into nude mice (n = 5/group)
and allowed to grow up to ∼200 mg, when treatment with AF (60 mg/kg daily × 4 d i.p.) was started. Tumor weight was measured as described in Materials
and Methods, (Mann-Whitney test; *, P < 0.01). B, quantitative determination of HIF-1α protein levels (**, P < 0.05). C, mRNA expression of HIF-1
target genes (VEGF, CA9, and PDK-1) in tumor lysates from mice treated with vehicle or AF was assessed (P < 0.05). Values are expressed as fold change

of AF. Notably, experiments conducted in the presence of actinomycin D showed that active transcription was required
for the downregulation of HIF-1α mRNA expression by AF.
The discrepancy between accumulation of HIF-1α pre-mRNA
and decrease of HIF-1α mRNA levels might have suggested a
potential effect of AF plus hypoxia on HIF-1α mRNA processing and/or maturation. However, results obtained in the
presence of actinomycin-D argue against this conclusion
and are consistent with transcriptional induction of either
(a) a repressor, which in turn is responsible for inhibition
of HIF-1α mRNA expression, or (b) noncoding RNA species,
which may account for both inhibition of HIF-1α mRNA expression and translation. The latter possibility is consistent
with (a) the mechanism of action of AF, which implicates
protein nucleic acid complexes (33, 35), (b) the lack of correlation between magnitude of HIF-1α mRNA inhibition and
inhibition of HIF-1α translation, and (c) the ability of topo-

tecan, a DNA-damaging agent that also inhibits HIF-1α
translation, to increase the levels of antisense transcripts of
the HIF-1α genomic sequence (47). Several miRs have been
recently identified that indeed target the 3′-untranslated region of HIF-1α mRNA, leading to the inhibition of HIF-1α
protein levels (48–50). It is then plausible that the effects of
DNA-damaging agents on HIF-1 protein translation may at
least in part implicate noncoding RNA species that target
HIF-1α mRNA expression and/or HIF-1α mRNA translation.
Further experiments are required to characterize the spectrum of miR induced by agents that concomitantly inhibit
HIF-1α and induce DNA damage to formally show the existence of a mechanistic link.
The proposed mechanism of HIF-1α inhibition by AF is
conceivably associated with effects on other genes and
pathways. However, AF did not inhibit NF-κB or AP-1 transcriptional activities and potently induced p21 mRNA and

protein expression, ruling out a global effect on mRNA expression and/or protein translation. Moreover, gene array experiments (using the Affymetrix human 133 2.0 plus chip)
indicated that 1.78% of genes were induced >2-fold, and
0.69% of genes were inhibited >2-fold in MCF-7 cells treated
with AF (0.25 μmol/L) for 16 hours, showing that AF does not
cause a global inhibition of gene expression (data not shown).
Evidence of inhibition of HIF-1α expression in xenograft
tissue (Fig. 6) further corroborates potential translational implications of the findings described in this article. Inhibition
of HIF-1α in AhR100 cells also raises the possibility that AF
might modulate HIF-1–dependent pathways even in cells
that are not sensitive to its cytotoxic effects, a feature that
would be emphasized by more protracted schedules of administration, as opposed to the ones generally used for cytotoxic agents. Finally, modulation of both mRNA expression
and mRNA translation induced by AF may potentially contribute to its anticancer activity and unveils novel properties
of AF that may help its clinical development.
