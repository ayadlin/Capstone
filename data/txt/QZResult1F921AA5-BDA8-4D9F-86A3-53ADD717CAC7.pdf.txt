Abstract
There remains a great need for effective therapies for lung
cancer, the majority of which are non–small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC). Here, we report the identiﬁcation of a novel candidate therapeutic target, LUNX, as a molecule overexpressed
in primary NSCLC and lymph node metastases that is associated with reduced postoperative survival. Functional studies
demonstrated that LUNX overexpression promoted lung cancer cell migration and proliferation by interactions with the
chaperone protein 14-3-3. Conversely, LUNX silencing disrupted primary tumor growth, local invasion, and metastatic

colonization. The ﬁnding that LUNX was expressed on cell
membranes prompted us to generate and characterize LUNX
antibodies as a candidate therapeutic. Anti-LUNX could downregulate LUNX and reduce lung cancer cell proliferation and
migration in vitro. Administered in vivo to mice bearing lung
cancer xenografts, anti-LUNX could slow tumor growth and
metastasis and improve mouse survival. Together, our work
provides a preclinical proof of concept for LUNX as a novel
candidate target for immunotherapy in lung cancer. Cancer Res;

Introduction

(8, 9). Northern blot analyses have demonstrated that LUNX
mRNA is undetectable in human liver, brain, pancreas, skeletal
muscle, adrenal gland, kidney, prostate, heart, stomach, spleen,
mammary gland, adipose, and thyroid tissues (5). Our previous
studies revealed that LUNX mRNA in peripheral blood and
pleural ﬂuid is one of the most speciﬁc genetic markers for NSCLC
(10). However, there have been no statistical analyses of LUNX
protein expression in large collections of primary tumor tissues,
and the correlations between LUNX expression and clinical factors
are poorly understood. It is unclear whether LUNX expression is
associated with pathologic type and severity in patients with lung
cancer. Therefore, the use of LUNX as a potential therapeutic target
in NSCLC is uncertain.
In this study, we analyzed clinical NSCLC samples and determined that LUNX was overexpressed in primary tumors and
enhanced in metastatic lymph nodes. In addition, increased
LUNX immunoreactivity in patients with lung cancer was accompanied by decreased postoperative survival. Next, we found that
LUNX promoted tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis by
binding to 14-3-3 proteins and reducing their phosphorylation.
The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved acidic proteins that
regulate numerous protein kinase signaling pathways. Studies
have shown that 14-3-3 expression is upregulated in various types
of cancer, and 14-3-3 z is overexpressed and promotes tumor
development in NSCLC (11–14).
LUNX expression is not detected in normal peripheral lung
tissues; however, it is overexpressed in lung cancer and promotes
lung cancer progression, thereby making LUNX a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. Indeed, LUNX-targeted shRNA has
been shown to reduce primary tumor growth, local invasion,
micrometastasis formation, and metastatic colonization in multiple established lung cancer xenografts. We also detected
LUNX protein in the cell membrane. Therefore, we generated a
LUNX therapeutic antibody that demonstrated signiﬁcant efﬁcacy
in in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. The LUNX antibody
directly downregulated LUNX protein expression and blocked its

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
Non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), mainly adenocarcinomas
and squamous cell carcinomas, represent approximately 80% of
all lung cancers. NSCLCs are often diagnosed as advanced disease
and confer a poor prognosis (1–3). Therefore, improvement in
lung cancer diagnostics and treatment is urgently required.
Lung-speciﬁc X (LUNX; also known as BPIFA1, PLUNC, and
SPLUNC1) is a member of the palate, lung, and nasal epithelium
clone (PLUNC) protein family (4). Some reports have suggested
that the human LUNX gene might be a potential marker for
NSCLC, and LUNX mRNA has been identiﬁed in peripheral blood
and mediastinal lymph nodes from patients with NSCLC (5–7).
Bingle and colleagues have detected LUNX in carcinomas with
glandular phenotypes by analyzing a limited panel of lung cancer
tissues; however, no LUNX staining was detected in normal
peripheral lung tissues by immunohistochemical analysis

LUNX, a Novel Therapeutic Target in NSCLC

downstream pathways. Importantly, S-35-8 (the LUNX antibody)
blocked metastasis and improved the survival of mice in preclinical models.

Materials and Methods
Antibody production
The S-35-8 (IgG2a-k) LUNX hybridoma was raised against a
His-tagged LUNX protein and screened by ELISA. The hybridoma
was cultured in RPMI-1640. The S-35-8 antibody was puriﬁed by
protein A afﬁnity chromatography (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences
AB) and labeled as follows: S-35-8- Rho (S-35-8 LUNX antibody
labeled with rhodamine) and S-35-8-FITC (S-35-8 LUNX antibody labeled with FITC).
Cell lines, plasmids, RNAi, and clinical samples
The A549, SK-MES-1, HFL1, SK-BR-3, HepG2, HO8910, NCIH292, NCI-H1299, NCI-H358, and NCI-H460 (H460) cell lines
were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank (Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Shanghai, China) and passaged in our laboratory for
fewer than 6 months after receipt or revival. DNA ﬁngerprinting
and the isoenzymes test were used to authenticate the cell lines.
The PG and Sk-lu-1 cell lines were obtained in 2003 from the
ATCC, and the last short-tandem repeat analysis was performed in
May 2012. The plasmids were constructed in our laboratory. For a
detailed description of each plasmid and sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides, see the Supplementary Materials and
Methods. Fresh specimens and parafﬁn-embedded tissues were
collected from the Anhui Provincial Hospital, the First People's
Hospital of Hefei, and the Anhui Chest Hospital (Hefei, Anhui,
China). The clinical characteristics of all patients with cancer in
this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1. For details, see
the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
ELISA
We established a double-antibody sandwich ELISA assay for
LUNX protein using an S-20-15 (the ﬁrst LUNX monoclonal
antibody)-coated plate and S-35-8 (the second LUNX monoclonal antibody) for testing and TMB coloration (OD450 < 0.1,
negative; OD450 > 0.1, positive). For details, see the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Immunoﬂuorescence, immunohistochemistry, Western
blotting, ﬂow cytometry, and apoptosis
Immunoﬂuorescent, immunohistochemical, Western blotting,
ﬂow cytometric, and apoptotic assays were performed as previously described (15–17). The JNK inhibitor SP600125 was used
in these studies (Beyotime). Images were captured with a Zeiss
LSM710 or an Axioskop 2 plus microscope.
Proliferation, migration, and invasion assays
Cell proliferation was determined by cytometry. Cell migration
and invasion were analyzed using wound-healing and Transwell
permeable support systems (Catalog No. CBA-100-C, Cell Biolabs; refs. 18, 19). For details, see the Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
GST-pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays
For the in vitro GST-pulldown assay, GST fusion protein–bound
sepharose beads were incubated with the puriﬁed His-tagged
LUNX fusion protein and GST or GST-14-3-3 q (Biological Solu-

tion Specialists) overnight at 4 C. The beads were washed twice
with PBS and 4 times with ice-cold PBS and then boiled in sample
buffer. For the immunoprecipitation assay, whole cells were
placed in lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
at pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate) for 2 hours and then
precleared by centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated
with protein A/G-coupled sepharose beads (sc-2003, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or anti-Flag sepharose beads (Sigma) coated with
the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 C. The beads were washed
twice with lysis buffer and 4 times with ice-cold PBS and then
boiled in sample buffer (20, 21).
LUNX overexpression and knockdown assays in vivo
Male athymic Balb/c nude mice (5 weeks of age, Shanghai
Experimental Animal Center, Shanghai, China) were used to
establish subcutaneous and metastatic lung cancer xenograft
models to analyze in vivo tumor growth, metastasis, and invasion.
For the LUNX overexpression and knockdown experiments in the
subcutaneous xenograft model, A549-mock, A549-LUNX, A549sh-mock, A549-sh-LUNX1, or A549-sh-LUNX2 stable cell lines (2
 106 cells) were injected subcutaneously into the axilla of the
nude mice. For the shRNA experiments in the subcutaneous
xenograft model, A549 cells (2  106 cells) were injected subcutaneously into the axilla of nude mice. When the tumors were
palpable, the sh-LUNX1, sh-LUNX2, or sh-mock plasmids along
with the DNA transfection reagent (Entranster-in vivo, Engreen)
were injected into the tumor twice weekly. The tumor volume was
calculated as (width2  length)/2 (22). For the LUNX overexpression and knockdown experiments in the lung cancer xenograft
model and the orthotopic xenograft model, the A549-mockluciferase, A549-LUNX-luciferase, A549-sh-mock-luciferase,
A549-sh-LUNX1-luciferase, or A549-sh-LUNX2-luciferase stable
cell lines (2  106 cells) were injected in the tail vein (intravenously) or the lung parenchyma of the nude mice. Tumor metastasis and invasion were analyzed 3 weeks later. The mice were
injected with D-luciferin and imaged for 5 minutes using the IVIS
200 Imaging System (Caliper LS; ref. 18).
Determination of the therapeutic effects of the LUNX antibody
Male athymic Balb/c nude mice (5 weeks of age, from the
Shanghai Experimental Animal Center) were used to establish
subcutaneous and metastatic lung cancer xenograft models to
assess the therapeutic effects of the LUNX antibody S-35-8. In
the subcutaneous lung cancer xenograft model, A549 or NCIH292 (5  106) cells were transplanted s.c. into the axilla of
nude mice. The LUNX antibody (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg body
weight), IgG, or PBS vehicle was injected intravenously twice
weekly once the tumors were palpable. The tumor volume was
calculated as (width2  length)/2. In the metastatic lung cancer
xenograft model, A549-luciferase cells (2  106) were transplanted intravenously into nude mice. From the second day,
the LUNX antibody (20 mg/kg body weight) or PBS vehicle
was injected intravenously twice weekly. Tumor metastasis
and invasion were analyzed after 3 and 5 weeks. The mice
were injected with D-luciferin and imaged for 5 minutes using
an IVIS 200 Imaging System (Caliper LS).

among three or more groups were determined using one-way
ANOVA followed by 2-tailed t tests. Kaplan–Meier analysis of
tumor patients and the log-rank test were performed for comparison of the survival curves according to the LUNX level. P  0.05
was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
LUNX is overexpressed in NSCLC cells, especially in tumor cell
lymph node metastases
We previously determined that LUNX mRNA in peripheral
blood and pleural ﬂuid is a speciﬁc genetic marker for NSCLC
(10). To investigate LUNX expression in NSCLC, we assessed its
protein levels in a series of cell lines and clinical NSCLC specimens. We found that the LUNX protein was highly expressed in
NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H292, A549, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H358)
and in tumor tissue from patients with NSCLC, whereas there was
no expression in lung ﬁbroblast (HFL1), breast adenocarcinoma
(SK-BR-3), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), or ovarian cancer

(H08910) cell lines, and only weak expression was detected in the
paired paracancerous tissues (Fig. 1A and B). Several LUNXpositive cells in the paracancerous tissues may have been inﬁltrating tumor cells. Furthermore, KRAS and/or p53 mutations are
quite frequent in NSCLC. Here, we detected LUNX expression
both in KRAS-mutant NSCLC and in p53-mutant NSCLC cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Of the 150 total adenocarcinoma and
squamous cell carcinoma samples, 80.6% (121 of 150) displayed
elevated LUNX protein expression levels. LUNX expression was
more frequently detected in primary tumor tissue from patients
with adenocarcinoma (92%, 69 of 75) than from patients with
squamous cell carcinoma (69.6%, 52 of 75). In patients with
adenocarcinoma, a high percentage of specimens showed high
or moderate LUNX expression. Moreover, in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, LUNX protein expression was associated
with tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) stage and histologic grade,
and increased LUNX protein expression was associated with
increased clinical and pathologic severity (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S2).

LUNX, a Novel Therapeutic Target in NSCLC

To further investigate LUNX expression in NSCLC, we evaluated whether LUNX expression was associated with postoperative clinical outcomes. In the 4-year follow-up evaluation of
102 postoperative patients, increased LUNX immunoreactivity
in patients with NSCLC was accompanied by signiﬁcantly
decreased postoperative survival (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Table S3). In some of these patients with NSCLC, increased
LUNX expression was associated with signiﬁcantly reduced 5year overall post-surgery survival (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
The Kaplan–Meier analysis of 48 patients with adenocarcinoma
and a log-rank test showed no signiﬁcant association of LUNX
expression with overall survival (P ¼ 0.2), possibly because of
the small size and uneven sample distribution (Fig. 1B). These
results indicated that patients with NSCLC presenting with high
LUNX expression exhibited a worse prognosis than those with
moderate or low LUNX expression.
In addition, we did not observe these results in samples from
patients with benign lung diseases such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, and we did not detect LUNX expression in other organs or
cancers (colon, liver, and breast; Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Intracellular proteins are released into the pleural ﬂuid of
patients with chest effusions due to necrocytosis. LUNX expression was detected in the pleural ﬂuid of patients with NSCLC but
not in the samples from patients with benign lung diseases
(pneumonia and tuberculosis; Fig. 1B).
Next, to assess LUNX expression in metastatic tumor cells, we
tested 30 NSCLC samples with low LUNX expression in the
primary tumor and determined that LUNX expression was frequently higher in metastatic regional lymph nodes compared
with the matched primary tumor tissue (Fig. 1C). Clinically,
primary lung tumors typically metastasize to the supraclavicular
lymph nodes. Therefore, by evaluating the LUNX expression in
supraclavicular lymph node metastases, we detected that LUNX
was overexpressed in supraclavicular lymph node metastases
from patients with NSCLC but not with other types of cancer
(lymphoma, breast, hepatoma, and esophageal; Fig. 1D). We
tested 17 samples obtained via paracentesis and detected LUNX
overexpression in 77.8% (7 of 9) of the samples from patients
with NSCLC but not in any of the samples from the patients with
other types of cancer (0 of 8; Fig. 1D).
In further study, we evaluated the association between LUNX
expression and the incidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
Samples from patients with TNM stages II and III lung cancer were
investigated for LUNX expression, and we observed a positive
association between a regional lymph node metastasis and LUNX
expression (Fig. 1B).
These data demonstrated that LUNX was overexpressed in
primary tumors and enhanced in the metastatic lymph nodes of
patients with NSCLC but was rarely detected in benign lung
diseases and other organs (colon, liver, and breast). Furthermore, high LUNX protein levels were associated with poor
prognosis.
LUNX promotes lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and
invasion
LUNX protein expression was enhanced in metastatic lung
cancer cells in several NSCLC samples, suggesting that LUNX may
play a critical role in metastasis and invasion. To address this
possibility, we evaluated LUNX expression in a panel of lung
cancer cell lines with varying degrees of metastatic potential. The
NCI-H292 and PG cells, which have a higher metastatic capacity

www.aacrjournals.org

than other tested lung cancer cell lines (A549, H460, SK-MES-1,
and SK-lu-1), expressed higher levels of LUNX (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S2A).
To further evaluate the role of LUNX in lung cancer cell
migration and invasion, we stably overexpressed or depleted
LUNX (using 2 different shRNAs against LUNX, sh-LUNX1 and
sh-LUNX2) in 2 LUNX-positive NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H292 and
A549, and found that LUNX overexpression promoted migration
and invasion (Fig. 2C and D). Conversely, we demonstrated that
LUNX silencing reduced tumor cell migration and invasion (Fig.
2C and D and Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Next, we assessed the role of LUNX in lung cancer cell proliferation. We found that LUNX overexpression increased proliferation of NCI-H292 and A549 cells. In addition, LUNX silencing in
these cells reduced proliferation and Ki67 expression (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C).
These data suggested that LUNX expression is both necessary
and sufﬁcient to promote lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.
LUNX promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and migration by
binding to 14-3-3 proteins and activating 14-3-3 pathways
To gain insight into the mechanism by which LUNX promotes
the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells, we
analyzed LUNX-associated proteins immunoprecipitated from
293T (transfected with Flag-LUNX) or NCI-H292 cell lysates using
shotgun mass spectrometry. The data revealed that 14-3-3 was the
major protein associated with LUNX (data not shown). The
interaction between LUNX and 14-3-3 was conﬁrmed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with Flag-tagged LUNX in
293T cells (transfected with Flag-LUNX); similarly, endogenous
LUNX bound to 14-3-3 in NCI-H292 and A549 lung cancer cells
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). To date, seven isoforms
(b, e, h, g, t, z, and s) of 14-3-3 have been identiﬁed in mammals
(23). We found that the speciﬁc 14-3-3 isoforms that bound
to LUNX were 14-3-3 q and 14-3-3 z (Fig. 3A). Furthermore,
a reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that endogenous LUNX interacted with 14-3-3 and puriﬁed GST-14-3-3
q immunoprecipitated LUNX, suggesting that LUNX directly
interacted with 14-3-3 (Fig. 3A).
In further study, we found that LUNX silencing strongly
enhanced 14-3-3 phosphorylation in NCI-H292 and A549 cells
(Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Previous studies have
shown that 14-3-3 proteins are activated by homo- and heterodimer formation (23), that phosphorylated 14-3-3 exists exclusively as a monomer, and that the phosphorylation of a single
monomer within a dimer is sufﬁcient to disrupt the dimeric
structure (11, 12). Using native gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (24), we determined that LUNX silencing disrupted
the formation of 14-3-3 dimers and increased the proportion of
14-3-3 monomers (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Elevated 14-3-3 z and 14-3-3 q expression has been observed in
NSCLC, and 14-3-3 z overexpression is also associated with tumor
development (13, 25, 26). We determined that silencing 14-3-3 z
or q reduced NCI-H292 and A549 cell migration and proliferation
(Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D). These data
suggested that the z and q isoforms of 14-3-3 are important for
tumor progression.
To further evaluate whether LUNX promoted cell migration
and proliferation by targeting 14-3-3 z and 14-3-3 q, we studied
the relationship between 14-3-3 z, 14-3-3 q and LUNX-associated

cell migration and proliferation. LUNX-overexpressing NCI-H292
cells displayed increased cell migration and proliferation compared with mock-transfected (control) cells; however, when 14-33 z and 14-3-3 q were knocked down together, LUNX-overexpressing NCI-H292 cells were no more metastatic or proliferative than
mock-transfected (control) NCI-H292 cells (Fig. 3C). Similar
results were also observed in A549 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3E). These ﬁndings suggested that LUNX promotes lung cell
migration and proliferation by targeting 14-3-3 z and 14-3-3 q.
In tumors, the 14-3-3 proteins bind to all Raf proteins and
positively regulate Raf signaling, thereby functioning as direct
effectors of Ras GTPase, which activates the Erk1/2 MAP kinase
pathway (12, 27). In our experiments, silencing LUNX, 14-3-3 z or
14-3-3 q reduced phospho-Erk1/2 (Fig. 3D). The 14-3-3 proteins
stabilize the activation-competent conformation of Raf to stimulate the next step in the MAP kinase cascade (27). We found that
LUNX silencing had no effect on p38 phosphorylation but did
decrease phospho-JNK levels (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig.
S3F). Previous reports have shown that JNK is activated in a subset
of NSCLC biopsies and promotes oncogenesis in the bronchial
epithelium (28). Similarly, in our study, inhibiting JNK phosphorylation reduced NCI-H292 migration and proliferation

1084 Cancer Res; 75(6) March 15, 2015

(Supplementary Fig. S3H). LUNX silencing decreased phosphoJNK and its downstream targets phospho-ATF-2 and phospho-cJun (Supplementary Fig. S3G). LUNX silencing had no obvious
effect on AKT phosphorylation and cell apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3F and S3I).
Together with the above results showing that LUNX promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and migration by binding
to 14-3-3 z and 14-3-3 q and activating 14-3-3 pathways, these
data indicated that LUNX may be a potential therapeutic target
in lung cancer.
Targeting LUNX reduces lung cancer growth, metastasis, and
invasion
To explore whether LUNX is an effective therapeutic target in
lung cancer, we tested the relationship between LUNX levels and
tumor progression by conducting multiple lung cancer xenograft
experiments using stable LUNX-silenced or -overexpressing A549
cells.
Tumor growth, metastasis, and invasion are key steps in tumor
progression. First, to assess the effect of targeting LUNX on
reducing the lung cancer invasion metastasis cascade, we established a murine orthotopic xenograft model and monitored

tumor metastasis by D-luciferin–based bioluminescence. We generated stably LUNX-depleted, mock-depleted, LUNX-overexpressing, and mock-transfected cell lines, which were injected into
nude mice via the lung parenchyma. The mice injected with stably
LUNX-depleted cells had fewer distant metastases (sh-LUNX1
group, n ¼ 0 of 5; sh-LUNX2 group, n ¼ 1 of 5) than mice injected
with stably mock-depleted cells (n ¼ 3 of 5). In contrast, the mice
injected with stably LUNX-overexpressing cell lines exhibited an
increase in distant metastases (n ¼ 5 of 5) compared with mice
injected with stably mock-transfected cells (n ¼ 3 of 5). The
outgrowth of distant metastases in the LUNX-overexpressing
group was markedly increased compared with the mock-transfected group; in contrast, micrometastasis formation and metastatic colonization were reduced in the LUNX-depleted groups
compared with the control group (Fig. 4A). Local invasion is the
initial step in tumor metastasis. In this orthotopic xenograft
model, depleted LUNX reduced the ability of tumor cells to invade
normal tissues and organs (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
In the metastatic cascade, micrometastasis formation and metastatic colonization at a distant tissue are the ﬁnal key steps. To
investigate whether LUNX was involved in these steps, we estab-

lished a tail vein injection model to imitate micrometastasis
formation and metastatic colonization of disseminated tumor
cells. LUNX stable overexpression increased the ﬂuorescent area
representing tumor foci in various organs, including the lungs,
abdominal organs, and the thighbone. In contrast, stable silencing of LUNX reduced massive colonization and the number of
micrometastasis foci throughout the body, and metastatic colonization was almost undetectable in all mice (Fig. 4B). Analysis of
the number of metastatic lung nodes conﬁrmed the enhanced
colonization ability conferred by LUNX (Fig. 4B). The lung
weights revealed that the elevated LUNX expression facilitated
the metastatic colonization of tumor cells in the lung (Fig. 4B).
Finally, using the same protocol, the mouse survival in the model
was inversely proportional to LUNX expression (Fig. 4B). These
data demonstrated that LUNX-targeted shRNA disrupted the local
invasion, micrometastasis formation, and metastatic colonization of lung cancer cells in the initial and ﬁnal steps of the
invasion–metastasis cascade.
Next, to assess whether targeting LUNX reduced lung cancer
growth, we analyzed subcutaneous tumor growth in a mouse
xenograft model. We generated stably LUNX-depleted, mock-

depleted (control), LUNX-overexpressing, and mock-transfected
(control) cell lines, which were injected subcutaneously into nude
mice. The growth of LUNX-overexpressing tumors was more rapid
than the mock-transfected tumors (control); conversely, LUNXtargeted shRNA reduced tumor growth (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4C). In addition, the proliferation of the LUNX-targeted
shRNA-treated tumors was reduced, as evidenced by the Ki67
staining (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
To further assess the potential of LUNX as a therapeutic target in
lung cancer, we treated mice bearing subcutaneous tumors (A549
cells) with vectors expressing LUNX-shRNA or mock-shRNA along
with a DNA transfection reagent. We found that LUNX-targeted
shRNA suppressed lung cancer growth (Fig. 4D).
These data suggested that LUNX-targeted shRNA disrupts lung
cancer growth, metastasis, and invasion and indicated that LUNX
may be an effective therapeutic target in lung cancer.

LUNX antibody S-35-8 inhibits lung cancer proliferation and
migration by downregulating LUNX
On the basis of the marked hydrophobicity of LUNX (29),
we assessed LUNX localization on the membranes of cultured tumor cells. LUNX was detected in the puriﬁed membranes of NCI-H292 and A549 cells (Fig. 5A). Immunoﬂuorescence staining and ﬂow cytometry for LUNX showed
membranous expression in NCI-H292 and A549 cells (no
perforation; Fig. 5A).
LUNX has potential as a therapeutic target in lung cancer
based on its weak expression in peripheral lung tissues,
its overexpression in lung cancer cells, its localization on the
cell membrane, and its ability to promote lung cancer progression. Therefore, we screened antibodies for the ability to recognize LUNX on the cell surface and to inhibit tumor cell
proliferation and migration. We selected one antibody, S-35-8,

a mouse IgG2b clone that speciﬁcally bound to the LUNX
protein (Supplementary Fig. S5A). This antibody did not
induce apoptosis in the NCI-H292 cells but did inhibit
A549, NCI-H292, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H358 cell migration
and proliferation, which correlated with the antibody dose (Fig.
5B and Supplementary Fig. S5B–S5D).
To study the molecular mechanism of action of S-35-8, we
performed Western blot analyses and showed that the S-35-8
treatment reduced LUNX protein levels and that increasing the
dose of S-35-8 to 160 mg/mL led to complete blockage of LUNX
expression. Previously, we demonstrated that LUNX modulates
14-3-3 activity by inhibiting 14-3-3 phosphorylation, contributing to lung cancer cell proliferation and migration. Here, we found
that the S-35-8–induced LUNX downregulation led to 14-3-3
phosphorylation and subsequently reduced the activation of
pathways downstream of 14-3-3, such as the Erk1/2 and JNK
pathways (Fig. 5C).
To better understand the mechanism of S-35-8–mediated
LUNX downregulation, we treated NCI-H292 and A549 cells with
S-35-8-Rho (S-35-8-Rho, S-35-8 labeled with rhodamine; Fig. 5D
and Supplementary Fig. S5E) and found that antibody endocytosis and antibody degradation were observed after 24 and 48
hours of treatment, respectively.
These data validated the use of a therapeutic LUNX antibody in
lung cancer. The molecular mechanism of action of the antibody
was based on its ability to reduce LUNX protein levels via
antibody endocytosis.

The LUNX antibody S-35-8 inhibits lung cancer growth and
metastasis in vivo
To analyze the therapeutic effect of S-35-8 in vivo, we established multiple mouse xenograft models and analyzed the effect
of S-35-8 on tumor invasion, metastasis, and growth. First, to
assess the effect of S-35-8 treatment on lung cancer metastasis, we
implanted A549 tumors into mice via tail vein injection to
establish a metastatic xenograft model and then treated the mice
with PBS or S-35-8 (20 mg/kg). Next, we monitored the time to
tumor micrometastasis formation and metastatic colonization.
After 3 weeks of treatment, all PBS-treated mice (n ¼ 6 of 6) had
multiple bilateral lung tumors and 66.7% of them (n ¼ 4 of 6)
formed micrometastases that colonized the entire body (such as
the humerus and enterocelia). In contrast, 50% of the S-35-8–
treated mice (n ¼ 3 of 6) showed signs of lung tumor growth, and
none (n ¼ 0 of 6) formed micrometastases or colonized the entire
body. Similar results were observed after 5 weeks of treatment.
These data suggest that treatment with S-35-8 signiﬁcantly
reduced tumor metastasis, including micrometastasis formation
and metastatic colonization throughout the entire body (Fig. 6A).
An analysis of the number of metastatic lung nodes conﬁrmed the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of S-35-8 (Fig. 6A). Finally, using the same
protocol, improved mouse survival was observed after treatment
with S-35-8 (Fig. 6A).
Next, to analyze the therapeutic effect of S-35-8 on tumor
growth, we subcutaneously implanted A549 tumors into mice,
treated the mice with PBS, IgG, or S-35-8 (20 mg/kg), and

monitored the time to tumor growth. S-35-8 treatment significantly reduced tumor growth (Fig. 6B). Consistent with these
results, immunohistochemical analysis showed that Ki67 staining was reduced in tumors treated with S-35-8 (Supplementary
Fig. S6A). Similarly, mice bearing palpable subcutaneous
NCI-H292 tumors exhibited reduced tumor growth when treated with S-35-8 (Fig. 6C). The rapid growth of NCI-H292
tumors caused a signiﬁcant reduction in mouse body weight;
in contrast, S-35-8–treated mice maintained a normal body
weight (Fig. 6C). In dose escalation studies of S-35-8, a dose of
30 mg/kg had signiﬁcant inhibitory effects on NCI-H292 tumor
growth (Fig. 6C).
We veriﬁed the delivery of S-35-8 into established orthotopic
tumors in vivo via tail vein injection of S-35-8-FITC (S-35-8 labeled
with FITC). Twelve hours after the injection, S-35-8-FITC had
strongly accumulated in tumor tissues but showed relatively weak
accumulation in normal lung tissue (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Toxic side effects are an important factor that determines a
drug's clinical application. In our study, no cases of sudden death,
pulmonary inﬂammation, or lung injury were observed upon
treatment of wild-type mice with S-35-8. No adverse weight
loss was noted even when the dose of S-35-8 was increased to
30 mg/kg body weight (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
These data suggest that the LUNX antibody S-35-8 suppresses
lung cancer growth and metastasis.

In this study, our results indicated that the LUNX protein
was overexpressed in NSCLC cells, weakly expressed in normal
lung tissue, and rarely detected in other normal organs. LUNX
overexpression in NSCLC strongly correlated with poor prognosis. These data conﬁrmed that LUNX is a potentially superior
diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for lung cancer. LUNX
(also named PLUNC) has been suggested to be a novel marker
of gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma, but LUNX staining has
not been detected in primary hepatic carcinomas or in normal
liver (30). The human LUNX family comprises 9 genes located
in a single locus on chromosome 20q11. Until now, a small
number of human LUNX proteins have been identiﬁed, and an
even smaller number of these proteins have been studied in
any detail (9, 31). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1D, we
assayed the mRNA levels of 8 genes with reported sequences in
NSCLC. Only BPIFA4p mRNA was detected in the NCI-H292
cells other than BPIFA1 (LUNX), but the BPIFA4p locus type
was found to be a pseudogene (Source: HGNC Symbol; Acc:
HGNC: 20469).
The invasion–metastasis cascade can be simpliﬁed into two key
steps: (i) cancer cell dissemination from the primary tumor to
distant tissues and (ii) translocation of cells to form micrometastases and colonize distant organs (32). LUNX-targeted shRNA
suppressed lung cancer cell invasion into the surrounding normal
tissue and disrupted the formation of micrometastases and the
metastatic colonization of tumor cells. Our results indicate that
LUNX may be involved in the mechanism of lung cancer metastasis. In addition, the transfection of expression vectors encoding
LUNX-targeted shRNA suppressed lung cancer growth by intratumor injection. These data suggested that LUNX is associated
with lung cancer progression and indicated that targeting LUNX
exerts an antitumor effect.

LUNX, a Novel Therapeutic Target in NSCLC

The major ﬁnding of our study was that the therapeutic targeting of LUNX inhibited tumor growth, metastasis, and invasion.
An increase in LUNX detection in nasal secretions and sputum has
been suggested to occur in inﬂammatory airway diseases (33, 34);
however, we demonstrated that LUNX also exists in puriﬁed cell
membranes, and membranous expression of LUNX was detected
in lung cancer cells by immunoﬂuorescent staining and ﬂow
cytometry. These data further conﬁrmed that LUNX is a potential
therapeutic target in lung cancer.
Next, we generated a therapeutic LUNX antibody, S-35-8,
which slowed the growth and blocked the local invasion and
metastasis of multiple established NSCLC xenografts. In addition,
S-35-8 exerted its effects not only in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells but
also in NSCLC cells with wild-type KRAS or mutant p53. In our
study, S-35-8 reduced LUNX expression on the cell surface by
antibody endocytosis, and a potential mechanism of action
involves the endocytosis and degradation of the LUNX-S-35-8
antigen–antibody complex. LUNX downregulation caused the
14-3-3 z and 14-3-3 q inactivation and the inhibition of the
Erk1/2 and JNK pathways, which might be a mechanism by which
S-35-8 exerts its antitumor effect. The therapeutic beneﬁt associated with antibody therapy is complex and most likely involves
multiple mechanisms in vivo. The Fc function of an antibody is
important for mediating tumor cell kill via antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vivo, whereas effective
tumor ADCC requires congenic effector cells, target cells, and
monoclonal antibodies; speciﬁc antibody afﬁnity and subtypes
may also be required (35). To improve the antitumor efﬁcacy of S35-8, additional studies are necessary to modify S-35-8 and
develop its use in humans.
In our study, S-35-8 reduced tumor growth, micrometastasis
formation, and metastatic colonization; therefore, it is highly
likely that S-35-8 may be translatable to clinical applications.
Toxic side effects are important factors that determine the clinical
applicability of a drug. Therefore, toxicity is a question that needs

to be addressed in this context, especially because LUNX has been
reported to be involved in antibiosis of the upper airway, to be
limited to a few nonciliated epithelial cells and to be elevated
under inﬂammatory conditions, such as cystic ﬁbrosis, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and allergic rhinitis (8, 9, 33, 36–
38). LUNX regulates airway surface liquid volume by binding
to ENaC in bronchial epithelial cultures (39). However, LUNX
protein levels are relatively low in normal tissues, and LUNX
staining is absent in small airways and peripheral lung (5, 8, 36).
Therefore, to conﬁrm the safety of this approach, further preclinical and clinical tests are necessary.
