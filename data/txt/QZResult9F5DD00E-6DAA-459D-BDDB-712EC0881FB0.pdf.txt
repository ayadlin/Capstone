Abstract
Cowden’s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple mucocutaneous lesions
and benign tumors, and enhanced cancer predisposition.
Most Cowden’s disease patients harbor inactivating mutations
in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene which encodes a lipid
phosphatase, PTEN, which restrains the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase–Akt signaling pathway. We observed that the
epithelial-specific deletion of Pten in mice causes multiple
hyperproliferative and tumor lesions that strikingly resemble
Cowden’s disease. This animal model system provided an
opportunity to explore novel therapeutic approaches in
Cowden’s disease. Indeed, we show here that rapamycin
administration, which inhibits a key downstream target of
Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), promotes the
rapid regression of advanced mucocutaneous lesions. Furthermore, when administered before disease manifestation,
rapamycin can halt the development of Cowden’s disease–like
lesions, thereby prolonging animal survival. These findings
suggest that mTOR inhibition with rapamycin may represent a
suitable therapeutic option for the chemoprevention and
treatment of Cowden disease patients and others tumor
syndromes that involve defective PTEN function. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cowden’s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple mucocutaneous lesions and
benign tumors, and by the predisposition to a variety of
malignancies, particularly breast and thyroid cancers (1–4). The
Cowden’s disease gene locus has been mapped to the chromosome
10q22-23 in which the PTEN gene is located (5–8). PTEN encodes a
lipid phosphatase, PTEN, which is a negative regulator of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by converting
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2; refs. 9–11). Underscoring the importance of PTEN as a tumor suppressor gene, germline mutations of
PTEN have been linked to several autosomal dominant hamartoma
syndromes including Cowden’s disease (Omim:308350), BannayanRiley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (OMIM:153480), and Lhermitte-Duclos
syndrome (OMIM:158350), which are all characterized by the
presence of benign tumors, known as hamartomas, in multiple

organs and an increased susceptibility to developing a variety of
malignancies (reviewed in ref. 12).
In the case of Cowden’s disease, PTEN germline mutations are
found in 80% of the patients, either in the PTEN coding sequence,
in the PTEN promoter, or in its 5¶ and 3¶ untranslated region
resulting in inhibition of translation or a catalytically inactive,
immature, or unstable PTEN protein, which may undergo rapid
degradation (10, 12). Pten heterozygosity and tissue-specific
deletion in mice leads to hyperplastic and dysplasic changes in
the prostate, colon, and skin, and to spontaneous tumor
development, supporting the notion that PTEN plays a causal role
in hamartoma syndromes (13–19). Cells exhibiting decreased PTEN
activity are not able to restrain the growth promoting properties of
PI3K and its lipid product, PIP3 (10, 11, 20). One of the best studied
downstream targets of PI3K is the serine-threonine kinase Akt,
which, upon activation by PIP3, promotes cell proliferation and
survival by phosphorylating multiple protein targets, thereby
controlling cell growth, protein translation, cell metabolism, and
program cell death (21, 22).
As Cowden’s disease is characterized by the high incidence
epithelial derived tumors, we selectively inactivated a floxed Pten
allele in mice by the expression of Cre recombinase under the
control of the keratin 14 (K14) promoter, which is expressed in hair
follicles, glandular ducts, epidermis, and other epithelial cells
(23, 24). Although mice developed normally, and newborn mice did
not exhibit any obvious phenotype, Pten deletion in epithelial cells
led to the development of multiple dermal lesions and breast and
thyroid tumors as age progressed, strikingly resembling Cowden’s
disease. This animal model provided an opportunity to explore the
efficacy of interfering with the PI3K/Akt pathway as a therapeutic
approach in this hamartoma syndrome. Indeed, we show here that
the pharmacologic inhibition of one particular downstream target
of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), by the prolonged
treatment with rapamycin promoted the rapid regression of
advanced Cowden’s disease–like lesions. Furthermore, we found
that by initiating the chronic administration of rapamycin before
the appearance of disease manifestation in mice, in which Pten
has been conditionally deleted, was sufficient to prevent the
development of Cowden’s disease–like lesions, thereby prolonging
remarkably animal survival. Thus, these findings suggest that the
blockade of mTOR with rapamycin and its analogues may
represent a suitable therapeutic option for the chemoprevention
and treatment of Cowden disease’s patients.

(5¶ cacgatacacctgactagctgggtg 3¶) and P4 (5¶ catcacccacaggctagcgccaact 3¶)
for K14-Cre.
Rapamycin administration. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was reconstituted in absolute ethanol at 10 mg mL 1 and stored at 20jC.
Rapamycin was diluted in 5.2% Tween 80 (Sigma) and 5.2% polyethyleneglycol (PEG-400; Hampton Research; ref. 26), and injected i.p., 1 mg/kg every
other day.
Culture of primary keratinocytes and Western blotting. Murine
keratinocytes were isolated as described (23), grown in KBM-2 medium
(Cambrex). After lyses, protein concentrations were determined and 30 g of
proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes, blocked with 5% milk protein, and incubated with primary
antibodies Akt, phospho-specific Akt (pAktSer473 and pAktThr308), and S6
(pS6; Cell Signaling Technology), PTEN (Cascade Bioscience), and tubulin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as previously described (27). Western blot
signals were quantitated by using the NIH Image J software.1
Histology and immunohistochemistry of tissue sections. H&E
staining was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 4-m
serial sections according to standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry
was performed on these paraffin-embedded and frozen tissue sections using
antibodies pAktSer473, pAktThr308, pS6 (Cell Signaling Technology), and
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Zymed Laboratories) as described
previously (26, 28). Quantitative analysis of the staining intensity was
performed by using the NIH Image J software. Procedure periodic acidSchiff (PAS) staining (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed as described by the
manufacturer.
Statistical analysis. Comparison of the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
was performed with the logrank test. Statistical analysis of the staining for
PCNA, pAktSer473, pAktThr308, pS6, and the body weight was performed by
ANOVA One-way, followed by the Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests
using GraphPad Prism 4.03 (GraphPad Software).

seen in the punctuate palmoplantar keratosis of the paws (Supplementary Fig. S1A; paw).

Results
Excision of Pten recapitulates features of Cowden’s disease.
We generated epithelial-specific Pten conditional knockout mice by
crossing mice harboring a floxed Pten allele containing two loxP
sites (PtenF/F) with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the
control of the K14 promoter (K14Cre). K14Cre PtenF/+ heterozygous mice were backcrossed with PtenF/F mice, and littermates
that inherited some but not all of the above alleles served as
controls. K14Cre PtenF/F mice were undistinguishable from the
littermates at birth. However, at ages 6 days, the skin was wrinkled
and flaky when compared with heterozygous K14Cre PtenF/+ and
control mice, and by ages 11 days, the hair shafts had a disheveled
appearance (data not shown). The animals progressively developed
multiple hyperproliferative lesions, ranging from mucocutaneous
lesions (95%; 41 of 44 mice) to tumor formation (Fig. 1A; Table 1).
In particular, multiple papules rapidly developed around the facial
orifices such as nose, mouth, and eyes (Fig. 1A, top). Punctuate
palmoplantar keratoses, acral keratosis, especially in the limbs and
periauricular, and oral papules were also frequently observed
(Fig. 1A, bottom). Histologically, most facial and periauricular
lesions had a follicular component with hyperproliferation of the
outer root sheath, also evident in the vibrissae (Supplementary
Fig. S1A; ear and vibrissae). Papillomatous lesions of the skin presented hyperkeratosis and acanthosis throughout the face and

alterations in the nipples. Multiple mammary gland tumors were
also observed in the thoracic and abdominal/inguinal mammary
glands of K14Cre PtenF/F mice (11%; 4 of 36 mice analyzed; Fig. 2B;
Table 1). This was even more remarkable in K14Cre PtenF/+ mice
(36%; 8 of 22 mice analyzed), as their extended survival enabled the
development of larger tumoral lesions. In both cases, lesions were
characterized by the presence of prominent intraluminal and
ductal proliferation (Fig. 2B, b). Histologic features of breast tumors
ranged from fibroadenomas (Fig. 2B, c) to adenocarcinomas and
ductal carcinomas with dense hyaline collagen or dense fibrosis

inhibition. Activation of Akt involves its recruitment to the
membrane by binding PIP3 and the initial phosphorylation of
threonine 308 (Thr308) in its activation loop by PDK1 (22, 31).
Subsequently, Akt is phosphorylated in serine 473 (Ser473) by one
of its downstream targets, the atypical kinase mTOR, thereby
increasing its activity (31). mTOR in turn regulates protein

PtenF/F mice in the first few days of life (Fig. 1B; Supplementary
Fig. S2A), their survival was much greater than observed when
using Cre driven by the K5 promoter (14). Although K14- and K5driven gene expression are expected to have somehow overlapping
tissue specificity (29), K14Cre PtenF/F mice did not develop esophageal hyperplasia, which could compromise the survival of K5Cre
mice. In addition, we were able to achieve an increase in animal
survival of K14Cre PtenF/F mice by removing littermate competition and extending the weaning period (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Under these optimized breeding conditions, most animals survived
until weaning, and 40% of the mice survived beyond ages 3 months,
although the life span of K14Cre PtenF/F mice did not exceed
250 days (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Decreased survival was
also present in heterozygous K14Cre PtenF/+ mice, which died or
had to be sacrificed because of morbidity (Fig. 1B). Nonetheless,
the ability to extend the survival of K14Cre PtenF/F mice for up to
ages 9 months enabled us to explore in detail the nature of the
pathologic conditions caused by Pten deletion in the epithelial
compartment of mice.
Hyperproliferative and tumoral lesions in K14Cre PtenF/F
mice. As described above, several cutaneous lesions could be
readily observed during examination of K14Cre PtenF/F mice. They
include the unique presence of trichilemmomas, a pathognomonic
sign of Cowden’s Disease (2) that resembles blown-up hair follicles,
which often exhibit cylindrical or lobular proliferation and PASpositive proliferating glycogen-rich clear cells (Fig. 2A, top). Besides
numerous skin alterations, Cowden’s disease is characterized by
thyroid multinodular goiter, adenomas, and increased risk for
thyroid cancer (4, 8). Indeed, homozygous deletion of Pten resulted
in alterations in the thyroid gland of K14Cre PtenF/F mice (n = 16),
including multinodular goiters (56%; 9 of 16 mice analyzed) and
thyroid tumors (12%; 2 of 16 mice analyzed) with a follicular aspect
(Fig. 2A, bottom; Table 1). Patients harboring PTEN deletions and
mutations also often develop fibroadenomas, fibrocystic disease,
virginal hypertrophy of the breast, and malformations of nipples
and areolae (3, 4, 30). This was reflected in K14Cre PtenF/F mice,
80% (29 of 36 mice analyzed) of which displayed morphologic

Cowden’s Disease Chemoprevention by Targeting mTOR

Figure 3. Rapamycin treatment reverses Cowden’s disease–like lesions and modulates mTOR pathway in K14Cre PtenF/F–derived tumors. A, representative
examples of rapamycin-treated mice (n = 4) within 9 d of treatment. Rapamycin profoundly decreases well-established mucocutaneous lesions in the face (top ) and

epithelium from control and K14Cre PtenF/F mice treated with vehicle or rapamycin. Note the elevated phosphorylation of pS6 and Akt in Ser473, and PCNA in
K14Cre PtenF/F mice. Upon treatment, pS6, pAktSer473 levels, and PCNA nuclear staining were notably reduced. pAktThr308, which is present in the nucleus of epithelial
cells in K14Cre PtenF/F mice, shifted to the membrane in rapamycin-treated mice. C, representative Western blot analysis of primary culture from mice for
molecules whose activity is regulated by PTEN and tubulin, as a loading control, in lysates from primary cultures of keratinocytes isolated from control (c ), K14Cre
PtenF/+ (f/+), and K14Cre PtenF/F (f/f ) mice (n = 3 independent experiment per genotype). Cells were treated with vehicle or rapamycin, as indicated. PTEN levels
were reduced in K14Cre PtenF/+ and almost absent in K14Cre PtenF/F, which presents increased levels of both pAktThr308 and pAktSer473. Rapamycin effectively
ablates S6 phosphorylation, normalizes pAktS473, and increases pAktThr308 in homozygous K14Cre PtenF/F mice when compared with heterozygous and control mice.

translation by phosphorylating 4EBP, an inhibitor of the translational initiation protein eIF4E, and p70S6K, which phosphorylates
the S6 ribosomal protein (32, 33). Recent studies have indicated
that the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis represents
a key proliferative pathway shared by multiple solid tumors (21, 22,
34, 35). Thus, we took advantage of the ability to block mTOR
function in vivo by the use of its specific inhibitor, rapamycin (36),
to explore the contribution of mTOR activity to the development
of Cowden’s disease–like lesions in K14Cre PtenF/F mice. As shown
in Fig. 3A, the treatment of symptomatic K14Cre PtenF/F adult mice
(n = 4) for only 9 days with a clinical relevant dose of rapamycin
(1 mg/kg; every other day; ref. 37) caused the regression of wellestablished mucocutaneous lesions, which was readily visible in the
face and paws.
Rapamycin treatment clearly diminished the activity of mTOR
in vivo, as judged by the dramatically reduced immunohistochemical detection of the phosphorylated form of S6, which was elevated
in K14Cre PtenF/F mice when compared with littermate controls
(Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2B). The reduced pS6 levels reflected
the inhibition of mTOR as part of its complex 1 (mTORC1), the
direct target of rapamycin (38), thus representing a suitable marker
for monitoring the activity of rapamycin on its target molecule (see
refs. 39–41, and references therein). Concomitantly, rapamycin
reduced the proliferation of epithelial cells within the skin lesions,
as assessed by PCNA staining (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2B),
which was quite elevated in Pten-deficient mice when compared

www.aacrjournals.org

with controls (P < 0.001). Aligned with the elevated levels of PI3K
lipid products in these Pten-deficient mice, there was an extensive
accumulation of Akt phosphorylated in its Ser473 site (pAktSer473)
in the skin of the vehicle-treated K14Cre PtenF/F animals (Fig. 3B,
top; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Prolonged treatment with rapamycin
resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of pAktSer473 (Fig. 3B;
Supplementary Fig. S2B). This is likely due to the indirect inhibition
of the mTOR 2 complex (mTORC2), which phosphorylates Akt on its
Ser 473 site, which represents a secondary effect of rapamycin
previously described to occur in vivo (38). However, there appeared
to be an increased level of pAktThr380 after rapamycin treatment,
which also shifted from the nucleus in the K14Cre PtenF/F animals
to the membrane. These observations suggest that upon mTOR
blockade, the activity of Akt may be enhanced, likely due to the
absence of a negative feedback mechanism restraining growth
factor activation of Akt (38), similar to that reported during recent
clinical trials with rapamycin in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma
patients (41). Of interest, however, this active Akt may not be able
to be released from the membrane in cells that accumulate PIP3
due to the absence of Pten phosphatase activity, as judged by its
membrane accumulation (Fig. 3B, middle).
Elevated levels of pS6 and the effect of rapamycin on pAktThr308
were also observed in primary cultures of keratinocytes isolated
from K14Cre PtenF/F mice. As expected, Pten levels were reduced in
cells isolated from heterozygous K14Cre PtenF/+ mice, and almost
absent in keratinocytes from K14Cre PtenF/F homozygous mice.

We observed increased levels of both pAktSer473 and pS6 in K14Cre
PtenF/F homozygous mice. Rapamycin treatment lead to a complete ablation of S6 phosphorylation, although it had only a limited
effect on pAktSer473 levels, aligned again with the direct effect of
rapamycin on the mTORC1 complex after short time treatment.
However, rapamycin provoked an increase in pAktThr308 in primary
cultures from Pten-deficient mice when compared with those
derived from heterozygous and control mice (Fig. 3C). Thus, the
effects of rapamycin on signaling events in the epithelial compartment of the skin of K14Cre PtenF/F mice likely represent a
primary effect on the targeted cells, rather than resulting from
alterations caused by mTOR inhibition in the stroma.
Rapamycin as a chemoprevention agent for experimental
Cowden’s disease. Over 90% of individuals affected with Cowden’s
disease are believed to manifest clinical signs of the disease by
the ages 20 years; 99% of the affected individuals develop
mucocutaneous lesions by the end of the third decade, although
other clinical manifestations may be present; and tumor formation
is usually detected at the beginning of the fourth decade (Fig. 4;
refs. 1–4). Of interest, as mice age, K14Cre PtenF/F animals acquired
a phenotype that closely resembles the progression of Cowden’s
disease (Fig. 4; Table 1). Thus, we asked whether rapamycin
administration before the appearance of disease manifestation
could prevent the development of Cowden’s disease–like lesions in

mice already harboring Pten deletions. For these experiments, we
administered a clinically relevant low dose of rapamycin (37)
starting at ages 5 days, and compared disease progression in the
treated animals to their littermate controls (n = 13 per group).
There were no statistically significant differences in the body
weight when comparing control mice treated with the rapamycin
inhibitor and vehicle (Fig. 4C). The K14Cre PtenF/F mice treated
with vehicle (20.9 F 2.8 g) were slightly smaller then their control
littermates (28.1 F 2.9 g) but gained weight similar to control mice
upon rapamycin treatment (24.1 F 2.5 g; Fig. 4C). Furthermore,
rapamycin treatment prevented the development of dermatologic
lesions, including facial papules, oral papules, acral, and palmoplantar keratoses, and increased the life span of K14Cre PtenF/F
mice (Fig. 4A and B). This reduction in the mortality of K14Cre
PtenF/F mice was quite remarkable (vehicle control: median survival, 94 days; rapamycin: median survival, >320 days; P > 0.0001;
Fig. 4B), suggesting that mTOR inhibition may represent a suitable
chemopreventive strategy to halt Cowden’s disease progression
(Fig. 4D).

Discussion
Cowden’s disease was named after the first described patient,
Rachael Cowden, in 1963 (1). The discovery of PTEN germline

somatic mutations in the majority of Cowden’s disease patients
have provided an opportunity for the early diagnosis to individuals
that are susceptible to the development of this debilitating and
cancer-prone syndrome (5–8). Aligned with the key role of PTEN
in Cowden’s disease syndrome, we were able to recapitulate most
of the pathognomonic lesions characterizing Cowden’s disease,
including trichilemmoma, acral keratoses, papillomatous, and
mucosal lesions, and even breast and thyroid alterations and
tumors by deleting Pten in stratified and ductal epithelial cells
using K14Cre mice, which was combined with the optimization of
the housing conditions to extend the life span of the affected mice.
The availability of this animal model provided a unique opportunity to explore the ability to interfere with PTEN downstream
molecules as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in
Cowden’s disease.
Reduced PTEN function, and thus elevated PIP3 accumulation,
can result in altered activity of a PI3K-depedent signaling network,
which ultimately promotes disease progression (21, 22). Although
inhibiting PI3K activity would be a good candidate to limit PIP3,
and as a result compensate for PTEN reduced activity, currently,
PI3K inhibitors may have undesirable side effects that limit their
clinical use (42). Among the many biochemical routes regulated by
PI3K, the Akt-mTOR pathway has recently emerged as a key component of proliferative pathways activated downstream from PI3K
and PTEN (34, 35, 43). In this regard, loss of mTOR is epistatic to
Pten loss in drosophila megalogaster (44, 45). Furthermore, the
oncogenic activity of Akt seems to be dependent on mTOR, and
many sporadic tumors involving PTEN deletions and inactivating
mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin treatment that blocks
mTOR (43, 46, 47). Indeed, we observed elevated activity of Akt and
mTOR in hyperproliferative lesions resulting from Pten deletion.
Thus, considering that prophylactic mastectomy is often recommended (48) and there is no approved therapy available for
Cowden’s disease, we explored the consequences of mTOR inhibition with rapamycin in this genetically defined animal model. We
observed that rapamycin treatment can rapidly revert the

mucocutaneous papillomatous lesions in the face and limbs, acral
keratosis, and deformities of nipples, among others, concomitant
with a marked decreased of the elevated levels of pS6, which served
as a suitable biomarker of drug efficacy in the target tissues.
Furthermore, the early treatment with rapamycin prevented the
development of Cowden’s disease–like lesion in mice in which Pten
was excised, thus dramatically increasing their life expectancy.
The use of rapamycin has been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 1999 to prevent renal transplantation
rejection (49). Since then, many analogues of rapamycin have
been developed, some of which have increased bioavailability and
are well-tolerated with reduced side effects, including lack of
immunesuppressive activity at doses that are effective in blocking
mTOR (35, 49). Rapamycin (41) and many of its analogues
(rapalogs), including CCI-779 (temsirolimus), RAD001 (everolimus), and AP23573, are in clinical trials for a variety of tumor
types, and CCI-779 has been recently approved by FDA for
the treatment of renal carcinoma patients (50). Collectively, the
extensive experience with the use of rapalogs in the clinic and
the key role of mTOR in Cowden’s disease progression may
provide the rationale for the early clinical evaluation of rapamycin
and its analogues as a molecular-targeted chemopreventive
strategy for Cowden’s disease and others tumor syndromes that
involve defective PTEN function.
