Abstract
Cervical cancer is the third most common gynecologic cancer
in the United States. The presence and possible involvement of
several cytokines have been studied in cervical cancer;
however, very little data, if any, are available on whether
cervical tumors are responsive to stimulation by the macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Given the involvement of c-fms and its ligand CSF-1 in gynecologic cancers,
such as that of the uterus and the ovaries, we have examined
the expression of c-fms and CSF-1 in cervical tumor (n = 17)
and normal cervix (n = 8) samples. The data show that c-fms
and its ligand are significantly higher in cervical carcinomas
compared with normal samples. Immunohistochemistry not
only showed that tumor cells expressed significantly higher
levels of c-fms but also c-fms levels were markedly higher in
tumor cells than tumor-associated stromal cells. Blocking
c-fms activity in cervical cancer cells, which express CSF-1 and
c-fms, resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased motility
compared with control, suggesting that CSF-1/c-fms signaling
may be involved in enhanced survival and possibly invasion by
cervical cancer cells via an autocrine mechanism. Combined,
the data show for the first time the induction of CSF-1 and
c-fms in cervical carcinomas and suggest that c-fms activation
may play a role in cervical carcinogenesis. Additionally, our
data suggest that transforming growth factor-B1 may be a
factor in inducing the expression of c-fms in cervical cancer
cells. The data suggest that c-fms may be a valuable therapeutic target in cervical cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):1918–26]

Introduction
Cervical cancer is the third most common gynecologic cancer in
the United States. It is more prevalent among women of low
socioeconomic status and is a major health problem in developing
countries. The majority of cervical cancers (85%) are of squamous
origin, whereas the rest are adenosquamous or adenocarcinomas.
The development of cervical carcinomas seems to be highly
associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection: f100%

of carcinomas have been shown positive for the presence of
HPV DNA (1).
HPV-associated cervical cancer induces inflammatory response
due to viral infection, resulting in potential increased macrophage
infiltration and induction of cytokines (2, 3). The presence and
possible involvement of several chemokines and cytokines have
been studied in cervical cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease process are still poorly elucidated (3).
One cytokine that has not been examined in much, if any, detail in
reference to its involvement in cervical cancer is the macrophage
colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), a cytokine and growth factor
that was first identified in macrophages. CSF-1 signals via a
membrane tyrosine kinase receptor, c-fms, a known protooncogene (4). Recent work from several groups suggests that
CSF-1 and c-fms expression may be involved in the progression of
female cancers, such as breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers
(5–7). The concomitant expression of both CSF-1 and c-fms has
been documented in a variety of cancers, including ovarian and
breast cancers, and is usually associated with more aggressive
disease (6, 8).
Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) is a pleiotropic growth
factor that plays contrasting dual roles of initial tumor suppression
via inhibition of cellular growth as well as promotion of tumor
growth and possibly metastasis during disease progression (9).
TGF-h signals through TGF-h receptor complexes (notably, TBRII
and TBRI) by binding to TBRII, after which TBRI is recruited to the
complex. Activation of TBRI, which is a serine/threonine kinase,
results in transmitting the signal into the nucleus via the classic
Smads pathway as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK; e.g., p38; refs. 9–13). Many tumor cells lose sensitivity to
inhibition by TGF-h in the event of loss of TGF-h receptor function
or that of intracellular signaling factors, such as Smad3 and/or
Smad4 (9, 14). However, there are instances where loss of growth
inhibition by TGF-h is not associated with loss of these signaling
components (15). This raises the possibility that, in addition to the
indirect protumorigenic role of TGF-h by inducing angiogenesis
and suppressing antitumor immune response, TGF-h may also
positively influence survival of tumor cells directly (16). Previous
studies showing that TGF-h1 induced c-fms expression in a murine
myeloid progenitor cell line and in vascular smooth muscle cells
suggested that TGF-h may mediate cellular functions via CSF-1/
c-fms signaling and prompted us to examine in this study whether
TGF-h1 induces c-fms expression in cervical cancer cells (17, 18).
Recent studies by our group and others have shown that the
serum levels of CSF-1 are increased in cervical cancer patients
compared with normal patients (19, 20), suggesting that CSF-1

signaling may play an important role in cervical cancer and may be a
potential therapeutic target. This study was designed to test whether
cervical tumor cells express c-fms and its ligand CSF-1 as well as to
examine the role of these factors in cervical carcinogenesis. One
study has detected equivalent c-fms expression in precancerous
cervical lesions and normal tissue but did not examine the presence
of c-fms in cervical carcinomas (21). Whereas several studies have
shown the expression of CSF-1 in ovarian and endometrial cancers,
no other study, to our knowledge, has examined the expression of
this growth factor and its receptor in malignant cervical tumors (6).
We report herein increased expression of CSF-1 and its receptor
c-fms in cervical tumor samples compared with normal cervix. In
addition, we have also examined the expression of CSF-1 and c-fms
in several cervical cancer cell lines and the effects of blocking c-fms
function on cervical cancer cell survival and motility. We have also
shown that TGF-h1 may regulate the expression of c-fms in cervical
cancer, suggesting a possible mechanism for the induction of CSF-1
signaling in cervical cancer.

Materials and Methods
Clinical samples. Using Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
protocols at Emory University School of Medicine (Atlanta, GA) and
associated hospitals, cervical carcinoma samples (n = 17) and cervical
tissue from age-matched normal cases (n = 8) were collected from
unselected patients presenting with cervical cancer and women having a
hysterectomy for problems unrelated to cervical disease, respectively.
Tumors tested were invasive squamous carcinomas (with the exception of
two adenocarcinomas), all of which were positive for HPV with
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage ranging from
I to III. Tumor biopsies were carefully taken from nonnecrotic areas
of cervical lesions to maximize intact RNA isolation from total tissue. After
obtaining informed consent as well as a detailed historical information
questionnaire from each patient, the biopsy samples were immediately
frozen and stored at 70jC for future analyses.
For immunohistochemistry, archival paraffin blocks of cervical biopsies
were obtained from Hospital De Clinicas De Porto Alegre (Porto Alegre, Rio
Grande do Sul, Brazil) with local ethical committee approval as well as
the University of Texas Health Science Center IRB (San Antonio, TX). Serial
4-Am sections were done, with the first section stained with H&E for
pathologic diagnosis and the following sections reserved for immunostaining. All tumors tested were HPV-positive squamous invasive carcinomas.
Cell lines. For this study, cervical cancer cell lines CaSki and HeLa were
used, both of which were positive for the two highest risk HPV strains
(HPV16 and HPV18, respectively), and HT-3 was used representing HPVnegative cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, CaSki cells represent the more
common squamous cervical carcinoma, whereas HeLa cells were derived
from cervical adenocarcinoma. All cells used in this study were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured
using RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Medium
conditions for different experimental treatments are described below.
siRNA transfection. SMARTpool-specific siRNA used in the studies
below was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection was
done using the highly efficient nucleofection technology as per the
manufacturer’s protocol (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, 1  106 cells
per transfection were resuspended in 100 AL of appropriate nucleofection
buffer (Amaxa) and mixed with 10 AL of 10 Amol/L SMARTpool siRNA in a
cuvette. Transfection was done in the Amaxa Nuclefector II using the
appropriate program. For HeLa cells, transfection efficiency using program
I-013 was determined at 70% after 24 h. For CaSki cells, transfection of
siRNA was done using DharmaFect 1 siRNA transfection kit according to
the manufacturer’s direction (Dharmacon).
RNA expression of CSF-1 and c-fms by reverse-transcription PCR.
Total RNA was isolated from total normal and cervical cancer tissue
samples (nonnecrotic regions were carefully selected by the physician)

using TRI Reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Total cDNA was synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and following the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. The cDNAs of CSF-1, c-fms, and the housekeeping gene actin
were amplified using sequence-specific primers. The primer set sequences
used are as follows: CSF-1, ATGACAGACAGGTGGAACTGCCAG and
TCACACAACTTCAGTAGGTTCAGG; c-fms, CAGATTGGTATAGTCCCGCTCTCT and TCCAACTACATTGTCAAGGGCAAT; and actin, AAGATGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGAC and CTGCTGCTGATCCACATCTG. The
amplification conditions were carried for 28 cycles using the Platinum
Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The amount of starting total
RNA (800 ng for CSF-1, 400 ng for c-fms, and 200 ng for actin) and cycle
number were optimized to reflect the exponential phase of amplification.
The PCR products were then visualized by electrophoresis in 1% agarose
gels and staining with ethidium bromide. Densitometric analysis was used
to quantify the products and normalize to the expression of actin. Real-time
PCR was also done using cDNA from reverse transcription reactions using
the Platinum Taq Polymerase according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
To detect amplicon synthesis in the SmartCycler real-time PCR thermal
cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), 0.25 Cyber Green dye (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) was added to the reaction mixture. The cycle threshold number
(C t) exhibiting the maximum curve growth rate was determined, and the
relative gene expression of each sample, normalized to that of actin, was
calculated by the formula 2C t (actin) C t (gene).
Immunohistochemistry. Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated,
and antigen retrieval was achieved by boiling the tissues in citrate buffer
(pH 6.0). Immunohistochemistry was done with the avidin-biotin complex
method using DAKO LSAB+ kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for CSF-1 and
Ultravision kit (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA) for all other antibodies according
to the manufacturers’ directions.
Endogenous peroxidase and avidin/biotin were blocked before the
incubation with primary antibody. The following primary antibodies,
dilution, time, and temperature of incubation were used: rabbit polyclonal
anti–c-fms (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), 1:50, overnight, 4jC;
CSF-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) mouse monoclonal anti-CD68
(marker for monocytes/macrophages; Lab Vision), 1:100, 30 min, room
temperature; mouse monoclonal anti–TGF-h1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA),
1:1,000, 1 h, room temperature; and rabbit polyclonal anti-TBRII (Abcam),
1:100, 30 min, room temperature.
Subsequently, biotinylated secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse or goat
anti-rabbit, was applied followed by streptavidin peroxidase. Immunoreactive complexes were detected using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine chromogen
exposure for 5 min. Finally, slides were counterstained with methyl green
and mounted. Negative controls were obtained omitting primary antibody.
Positive controls used were tonsil ( for c-fms, CSF-1, and CD68), breast
carcinoma ( for TGF-h1), and placenta ( for TBRII).
Scoring assessment. Three representative regions of each case were
previously chosen after H&E staining from blind pathologic analysis.
Sections were analyzed at 200 magnification according to the H-score (22)
using the following formula: H-score = (% cells did not stain  0) + (% cells
stained weak  1) + (% cells stained moderate  2) + (% cells stained strong
 3). Therefore, the H-score ranged from 0 (100% of negative cells) to
300 (100% of strong staining). For CD68 staining, cells were individually
counted at 200 magnification with mean area of 0.28 mm2, and values
were presented as absolute numbers after correction to the percentage of
stroma or epithelium presented.
Statistics. Data analysis was done using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences version 12 (SPPS, Inc., Chicago, IL), and comparisons of
variables with normal distributions were analyzed using the Student’s t test
(e.g., scratch assay), whereas comparison of variables with nonnormal
distributions was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test (e.g.,
immunohistochemical H-score). When appropriate, variables are presented
as mean F SD, even the ones with nonnormal distribution. In all tests,
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
ELISA. Cervical cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing
10% charcoal-stripped FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin at 50% confluence.

After 48 h of incubation at 37jC, conditioned media free of cells were
collected and centrifuged. CSF-1 levels in supernatants were determined in
duplicates using a commercially available sandwich ELISA kit specific to
human CSF-1 (Quantikine, R&D Systems) as directed by manufacturer’s
protocol. CSF-1 concentrations were determined using a standard curve
ranging from 0 to 2,000 pg/mL.
Colony formation assay. CaSki, HeLa, and HT-3 cells were seeded in sixwell plates at 500 per well in phenol red–free RPMI 1640 (containing 10%
heat-inactivated charcoal-stripped FBS) with or without 1 Ag/mL of
neutralizing c-fms antibody (2-4A5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA). After 10 days of treatment (medium with/without antibody changed
every 2 days), cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Images of
colonies were captured using a Nikon SMZ 1500 stereomicroscope with
digital camera, 7.5 magnification (Nikon, Melville, NY), and processed in
Corel Photo-Paint X3 (Corel Corp., Eden Prairie, MN) using the Magic Wand
Mask Toll to measure in pixels the area of colony formation. Values of
treatment group were presented relative to the area measured for controls.
Apoptosis studies. After treatment with c-fms–specific antibody (2-4A5),
CaSki, HeLa, and HT-3 cells were subjected to Annexin V-FITC and
propidium iodide double staining using the Apoptosis Detection Kit 1 from
BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA) as directed by the manufacturer followed
by flow cytometric analysis.

Cell migration assay. HeLa and CaSki cells transfected with control
siRNA or c-fms siRNA (2  106 per condition) as described above were
plated in a six-well plate at confluence per well. The monolayer was
wounded using a 10 AL pipette tip, and the cells were incubated for 48 h.
Digital images (400 magnification) were then taken for analysis using a
Nikon digital camera mounted on an inverted microscope. The median area
was measured using the internet-based software ImageJ.5

Results
CSF-1 and c-fms expression is elevated in cervical carcinomas. Our previous studies have shown that CSF-1 serum levels are
elevated in women with cervical cancer compared with women
with normal cervix, suggesting that CSF-1 may play a role in
disease progression (19). To investigate whether the expression
of CSF-1 and its receptor c-fms is elevated in cervical tumors,
we examined the expression of these factors in tumor (n = 17)
and normal cervix (n = 8) samples by reverse transcription-PCR

c-fms and CSF-1 in Cervical Cancer

(RT-PCR). The data in Fig. 1A and B show a significant increase in
c-fms and CSF-1 mRNA levels in cervical carcinoma samples
compared with normal samples. Representative data in Fig. 1 show
RNA expression by RT-PCR (Fig. 1C) and real-time RT-PCR
(Fig. 1D) in cervical cancer samples compared with normal samples. Given the oncogenic potential of c-fms, we further examined
its expression at the protein level by immunohistochemistry using
antibody specific to c-fms (Fig. 2, Table 1). For this purpose, a total
of 76 fields from 26 normal cervices and 84 fields from 28 cervical
carcinomas was analyzed. Our immunohistochemical analysis
showed that c-fms is mostly expressed in epithelial cells with low
expression in the stromal compartment (Table 1). Importantly,
tumor cells exhibited a significantly (P < 0.001) higher level of c-fms
in tumor cells of cervical carcinomas compared with epithelial cells
in normal cervical samples (Table 1). Representative tissue sections
stained for c-fms expression are shown in Fig. 2.
The data suggest that increased c-fms levels in tumor cells would
make them more responsive to its ligand CSF-1. Consequently, we
also examined CSF-1 levels in the tumors using immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 2). We observed increased CSF-1 expression
in cervical tumors compared with normal tissue (Fig. 2). Furthermore, cervical carcinoma samples exhibited higher infiltration of
CD68-positve macrophages, which is another source of CSF-1,
compared with normal cervical samples, suggesting the availability
of increased CSF-1 levels in the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 2;
Table 1).
Blocking CSF-1 signaling induces apoptosis as well as
decreases motility and colony formation in cervical cancer
cells. The expression of CSF-1 and c-fms by tumor cells raises the
possibility of a potential autocrine loop by CSF-1/c-fms affecting
the growth of the tumor. To examine further whether CSF-1 and
c-fms are expressed in cervical cancer cells, we tested the expression of these factors in CaSki, HeLa, and HT-3. As shown in Fig. 3A,
c-fms is expressed in HT-3, HeLa, and CaSki cervical cancer cell
lines. CSF-1 secretion was also detected by ELISA in these cell lines,
with notable higher levels in cultures from HT-3 cells (Fig. 3A). The
expression of this cytokine and its receptor suggests that CSF-1
may act via an autocrine mechanism in cervical cancer cells.
Previous work has shown that CSF-1 can enhance survival and
protect against apoptosis in HT-29 colon cancer cell line, and in
our previous studies, we have shown that CSF-1 can act as an
autocrine survival factor in ovarian and endometrial cells (23–25).
Based on our observations that CaSki, HT-3, and HeLa expressed
both CSF-1 and c-fms, we examined whether blocking c-fms activity
using a neutralizing antibody against c-fms would affect the growth
of these cells. This antibody was used previously to prevent c-fms
activity and block CSF-1–dependent colony growth of monocytes/
macrophages (26). The results in Fig. 3B show a drastic increase in
the cell death of the antibody-treated cells compared with
untreated control. To confirm apoptosis, cells having cytoplasmic
and nuclear shrinkage and chromatin condensation were identified
morphologically by microscopy (data not shown). Previous work
has shown that the CSF-1/c-fms signaling pathway is involved in
motility of breast cancer cells (27). We examined whether blocking
c-fms expression by specific siRNA would decrease motility of HeLa
and CaSki cells using the scratch test (Fig. 3C). Our data show that
transfection with c-fms siRNA resulted in a 50% reduction in
cellular migration compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA (Fig. 3C).
To determine the effects of autocrine CSF-1 on cervical cancer
growth, we did colony formation assay in the presence or absence

of neutralizing c-fms antibody with HeLa, CaSki, and HT-3 cells.
The data in Fig. 3D show clear reduction in colony formation in the
antibody-treated wells, suggesting that CSF-1 signaling is required
for growth of cervical cancer cells and that an autocrine
mechanism is relevant to the growth of these cells.
TGF-B1 induces expression of c-fms in cervical cancer cells.
As of yet, it is not known how the expression of CSF-1 or c-fms is
induced in gynecologic cancers. Two early studies have shown
induction of c-fms by TGF-h1 in a murine myeloid progenitor cell
line and in vascular smooth muscle cells (17, 18). Previous reports
have also shown that TGF-h1 can induce expression of genes
known to be responsive to TGF-h in HT-3, CaSki, and HeLa cells,
suggesting that TGF-h1 signaling is intact in these cells (28).
Combined, these studies raise the possibility that TGF-h1 may
induce the expression of c-fms in cervical cancer cells. To examine
this, we treated HT-3, HeLa, and CaSki with TGF-h1 and examined
the expression of c-fms. Figure 4A shows about a 4-fold and 2.5-fold

mRNA relative to untreated control, starting at 4 h (about a 3-fold
increase) and increasing for 9 to 10 h after treatment to 5- and 8fold induction in HeLa and HT-3, respectively (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, c-fms mRNA levels stimulated by TGF-h1 decrease 24 h after
treatment but are maintained at about a 2-fold increase over
untreated control. At 48 h, there is a distinct increase to f6-fold
over untreated control (Fig. 4B). In Fig. 4C, TGF-h1 also stimulated
c-fms expression in CaSki cells (f2.5-fold at 9 h of treatment) but
to a lower extent than that observed for HeLa and HT-3 cells (about
5- and 8-fold, respectively, at 9 h of treatment).
To confirm that TGF-h1 induction of c-fms in cervical cancer
cells is mediated via the TGF-h receptors, we blocked the
expression of TBRII using specific siRNA in the presence or
absence of TGF-h1 treatment (Fig. 5). The data indicate that
induction of c-fms by TGF-h1 is diminished when TBRII is downregulated by siRNA in HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). Similarly, transfection of

www.aacrjournals.org

CaSki cells with TBRII siRNA resulted in diminishing the induction
of c-fms by TGF-h1 (Fig. 5B). To further investigate the role of
TGF-h1 pathway in the regulation of c-fms, we treated cervical
cancer cells under TGF-h1 stimulation with SB203580 and
SB431542, which are inhibitors of the MAPK p38 and the TGF-h
receptor TBRI, respectively. Treatment with these inhibitors at
concentrations shown previously (29, 30) to inhibit TGF-h1 action
resulted in attenuating c-fms induction by TGF-h1 in HT-3 and
CaSki cells (Fig. 5C). Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells
(data not shown). Combined, the results implicate the TGF-h1
pathway in the regulation of c-fms expression and suggest that p38
may mediate this activity.
TGF-B1 levels are significantly higher in normal cervical
stroma than cervical tumor stroma, whereas TBRII levels are
significantly higher in cervical tumor than in normal
epithelium. The finding that TGF-h1 may be involved in the
regulation of c-fms prompted us to examine the levels of TGF-h1
and its receptor TBRII in cervical carcinomas. Few studies have
examined the levels of TGF-h1 in cervical cancer, yielding
conflicting results (31, 32). To examine the role of TGF-h1 in
cervical carcinomas in more detail, we determined the levels of
TGF-h1 in cervical carcinomas by immunohistochemical analysis.
The expression of TGF-h1 seems to be higher in the stroma
compared with the epithelial compartment in both cancer and
normal cases (Supplementary Figure S1; Table 1). More importantly, TGF-h1 levels were significantly higher in normal cervical
stroma compared with stroma in carcinoma samples (Table 1).
However, TGF-h1 levels were highly influenced by the presence of
extravascular blood, resulting from tumor bleeding, a common
occurrence in cervical carcinomas. TGF-h1 expression for carcinoma stroma with moderate/intense extravascular blood was
thrice (P < 0.001) higher than carcinoma stroma without or with
little extravascular blood (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary
Fig. S1). The production of TGF-h1 mainly in the stromal
compartment in addition to the supply from intratumoral bleeding
suggests that it may act on tumor cells in a paracrine fashion. As an
initial step to examine whether TGF-h1 signaling may be active in
cervical carcinoma, we did immunohistochemistry to detect TBRII
in cervical carcinomas (Supplementary Fig. S1). Our data show that
TBRII is expressed in tumor cells and that its levels are significantly
higher (P < 0.001) in tumor epithelia compared with normal
epithelium (Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 1). On the other hand, no
difference was detected in the levels of TBRI between carcinoma
and normal tissue samples (data not shown).

Discussion
The increased expression in CSF-1 and its receptor c-fms has
been observed in several gynecologic cancers, including endometrial and ovarian cancers as well as breast cancer (5, 33). The
concomitant expression of both growth factor and receptor by the
tumor has been associated with more aggressive and invasive
disease, suggesting an autocrine mode of regulation (6, 8). Little
information on the involvement of c-fms and its ligand CSF-1 in
cervical cancer is available. One study found no difference in the
expression of c-fms in cervical precancerous lesions and normal
tissue; however, c-fms levels were not examined in cervical
carcinomas (21). Several studies, one by our group, showed an
increase in serum and peritoneal CSF-1 levels in cervical cancer
patients compared with control (3, 19, 20). Combined, these studies
raise an important question on whether cervical carcinomas

express c-fms and CSF-1 and whether this expression is higher than
in normal tissue. To address this question, we have examined the
expression of these factors in cervical carcinomas compared with
normal cervical tissue as control. The data show a significant
increase in c-fms and CSF-1 expression in cervical carcinomas
compared with normal cervix, suggesting a possible role for this
growth factor signaling pathway in the etiology of cervical cancer,
similar to other studies showing the induction of CSF-1 and c-fms
in other gynecologic cancers, such as those of the uterus and the
ovaries (6, 8).
Increased c-fms expression revealed by RT-PCR in cervical
tumors suggested the possibility that tumor cells may have
increased responsiveness to CSF-1 stimulation. Like the RT-PCR
data, the immunostaining data clearly show that c-fms levels are
increased in cervical tumors compared with normal tissue but also
show that tumor cells, not necessarily infiltrating monocytes/
macrophages or stromal cells, are the main source of this receptor
in the carcinoma samples tested. CSF-1 expression by tumor cells
and significant macrophage infiltration, another source of CSF-1, in

the cervical tumor milieu suggest that autocrine in addition to
paracrine CSF-1 production may lead to stimulation of tumor cells
possessing increased levels of c-fms receptor. Such interactions
involving the CSF-1/c-fms pathway are involved in disease
progression as well as metastasis in other cancers, such as that
of the breast (7, 34–36).
Furthermore, our data suggest that autocrine CSF-1 signaling
may play a critical role in the survival and motility of cervical
cancer cells as evidenced by apoptosis, colony formation, and cell
migration assays in vitro. Another possibility that we did not test
but is the subject of ongoing investigation is that CSF-1 signaling
may also be involved in invasive or metastatic capacities of cervical
cancer cells.
At this point, it is not clear how c-fms or CSF-1 is induced in
cervical cancer. Two early studies have shown induction of c-fms by
TGF-h1 in a murine myeloid progenitor cell line and in vascular
smooth muscle cells (17, 18). In addition, a previous study has
suggested that TGF-h1 augments CSF-1 activity in bone marrow
(37). Our data show that TGF-h1 induces the mRNA expression of

transfected into HeLa (A) and CaSki (B)
cells using nucleofection technology and
DharmaFect kit, respectively, as described
in Materials and Methods. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were washed
with phenol red–free Hanks buffer and
RPMI 1640 (with 10% heat-inactivated
charcoal-stripped FBS) was added. After
48 h, TGF-h1 (10 ng/mL) was added to
appropriate wells. Cells were harvested
after 9 h of treatment, total RNA was
isolated, and real-time RT-PCR was done
with SYBR Green. C, in addition, cells
were treated with inhibitors of the TGF-h1
pathway [SB203580 (SB2 ) and SB431542
(SB4)] in combination with TGF-h1 or
alone in HT-3 and CaSki cells. After
washing with phenol red–free Hanks buffer,
cells were incubated in phenol red–free
RPMI 1640 (with 10% heat-inactivated
charcoal-stripped FBS) for 48 h. TGF-h1
(10 ng/mL) was added in the presence or
absence of SB203580 (10 Amol/L) and
SB431542 (5 Amol/L), and cells were
incubated for 9 h. Cells were then
harvested for RNA isolation. Real-time
RT-PCR was done using SYBR Green.
Data are representative of at least two
independent experiments.

c-fms and CSF-1 in Cervical Cancer

c-fms in cervical cancer cells HeLa, CaSki, and HT-3 and that
interruption of TBRII expression by specific siRNA resulted in
abolishing this response. We have also shown that treatment with
SB431542, which inhibits the activity of the TGF-h receptor TBRI,
also attenuates c-fms induction by TGF-h1. The data thus implicate
TGF-h1 signaling in the regulation of c-fms. Furthermore, the p38
inhibitor SB203580 also inhibited TGF-h1 activation of
c-fms, suggesting that p38 may mediate the regulation of c-fms.
An active TGF-h signaling pathway was confirmed in these cells by
another study, in which the expression of TBRI and TBRII was
detected, and treatment with TGF-h resulted in induction of TGFh–responsive genes (28). Several studies have also shown that p38
is activated on TGF-h1 treatment and that p38 is required for the
stimulation of certain gene expression by TGF-h1 (13). An intact
TGF-h signaling pathway during tumor progression has been
shown to lead to more aggressive disease and metastasis, which is
consistent with the proposed role for TGF-h as a protumorigenic
factor in cancer progression (14).
The data also showed that c-fms response to TGF-h1 in HT-3
(HPV negative) occurred at a somewhat higher extent than HeLa
(HPV positive) and that CaSki (HPV positive) exhibited the least
response. Whether this difference is due to HPV status or to the
functionality of downstream factors of the TGF-h1 pathway is
unclear at this time, and further experiment is required to
understand the role of HPV in this pathway.
Contradicting studies and the lack of detailed analysis of
TGF-h expression in cervical cancer, as well as our observations
showing induction of c-fms expression by TGF-h1, prompted us
to examine levels of TGF-h in cervical carcinomas (31, 32, 38).
Data presented here show a decrease in TGF-h1 levels in cervical
tumor cells and in associated stromal cells compared with normal
tissue. Interestingly, microvascularization and associated extravascular blood (bleeding) seemed to contribute significantly to
the levels of TGF-h1 available within the cervical tumor microenvironment and may compensate for the decrease of TGF-h1 in

tumor epithelia, which may stimulate tumor cells via a paracrine
mechanism.
Furthermore, very few studies have addressed whether TGF-h
receptors are expressed in cervical cancer (39, 40). Our immunohistochemical analysis detected the presence of TBRII (as well as
TBRI; data not shown) in all cervical carcinomas examined as well
as a significant increase in the average expression of TBRII. This
suggests that these tumor cells may be responsive to TGF-h1
produced in the stromal compartment, given that TGF-h
receptors/signaling components are functional in these cells. Thus,
it seems that cervical tumor cells do not necessarily lose the
expression of TBRII or TBRI during carcinogenesis, an observation
that warrants further studies to examine the functionality of TGF-h
receptors in cervical carcinomas.
Although the sample number in this study is too limited to draw
a correlation between CSF-1/c-fms signaling and cervical carcinoma progression, the data provide strong evidence for the
involvement of c-fms and its ligand CSF-1 in cervical cancer to
warrant the expansion of the study and increase sample number to
examine the prognostic value of CSF-1 signaling and to elucidate
the possible pathways that CSF-1 signaling may promote tumor
growth in cervical cancer. The induction of c-fms expression in
cervical tumor cells suggests their responsiveness to CSF-1 through
potential autocrine or paracrine regulation, suggesting that blocking CSF-1/c-fms may be a viable therapeutic strategy in treating
cervical cancer. The data also suggest that TGF-h1 may be a factor
involved in induction of c-fms in cervical tumor cells.
