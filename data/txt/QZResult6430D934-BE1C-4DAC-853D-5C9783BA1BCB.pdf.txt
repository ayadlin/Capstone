Abstract
Inhibitors of 5α-reductase (SRD5A) that lower intraprostatic levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) reduce the
overall incidence of prostate cancer (PCa), but there is significant variation in chemopreventive activity between individual men. In seeking molecular alterations that might underlie this variation, we compared gene
expression patterns in patients with localized PCa who were randomized to prostatectomy alone versus treatment with two different doses of the SRD5A inhibitor dutasteride. Prostatic levels of DHT were decreased by
>90% in both dutasteride-treated patient groups versus the untreated patient group. Despite significant and
uniform suppression of tissue DHT, unsupervised clustering based on prostatic gene expression did not discriminate these groups. However, subjects could be resolved into distinct cohorts characterized by high or low
expression of genes regulated by the androgen receptor (AR), based solely on AR transcript expression. The
higher-dose dutasteride treatment group was found to include significantly fewer cancers with TMPRSS2-ERG
genetic fusions. Dutasteride treatment was associated with highly variable alterations in benign epithelial gene
expression. Segregating subjects based on expression of AR and androgen-regulated genes revealed that patients are differentially sensitive to SRD5A inhibition. Our findings suggest that AR levels may predict the
chemopreventive efficacy of SRD5A inhibitors. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1286–95. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Androgens and the androgen receptor (AR) regulate prostate development and carcinogenesis (1, 2). Within the prostate, testosterone is converted to the more potent androgen,
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by 5α-reductase (SRD5A) types 1
and 2, and possibly type 3 (3, 4). The importance of SRD5A in
mediating prostate carcinogenesis was tested in the Prostate
Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), where the SRD5A2 inhibitor
finasteride decreased prostate cancer (PCa) incidence by 25%
(18% versus 24% in placebo-treated patients; ref. 5). This
striking benefit was tempered by an increase in high-grade
cancers, subsequently attributed to differential effects of finasteride on prostate volume and a possible selective inhibition of low-grade cancers (6). Using the dual SRD5A inhibitor
dutasteride, the REduction of DUtasteride of Prostate Cancer
Events (REDUCE) study reported a similar 23% reduction in

PCa incidence (low-grade cancers in 13.3% versus 18.1% of
placebo-treated patients; P < 0.0001), with no difference in
high-grade cancers (7).
Mechanisms by which SRD5A inhibition decreases PCa incidence have not been determined but likely reflect decreased AR axis activity caused by reduced tissue DHT,
potentially resulting in regression of extant cancers or suppression of de novo tumorigenesis. Importantly, 16% to 18%
of subjects in both PCPT and REDUCE were diagnosed with
PCa (of low- and high-grade histologies) despite undergoing
SRD5A inhibition. Factors responsible for the variable outcome of SRD5A inhibition in reducing PCa incidence among
different individuals are unknown.
We sought to identify dutasteride-related molecular alterations underlying the chemopreventive activity of SRD5A inhibition and to identify the effect of SRD5A inhibition on the
prostatic AR axis. We evaluated prostate tissues from a randomized study of 81 men with clinically localized PCa undergoing
surgery alone or after 4-month dutasteride treatment (8). We
quantitated gene expression changes in microdissected prostate epithelium and evaluated gene activity in relation to intraprostatic testosterone and DHT concentrations.

prostatectomy (RP) as described (8). Procedures involving
human subjects were approved by Institutional Review
Boards of participating institutions; all subjects signed written
informed consent. Tissues obtained at prostatectomy were
frozen in OCT (Tissue-Tek) and formalin fixed and paraffin
embedded. During the original clinical study, resected cancerous prostate tissues were preferentially placed in formalin for
paraffin embedding. Histologic analysis of multiple sections
from provided frozen tissue blocks revealed malignant prostate glands in <5% of samples; thus, we did not evaluate mRNA
levels in malignant prostate epithelium.
Serum and Prostatic Androgen Measurements
Serum and prostate androgen levels were determined using
gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy as described (PPD
Development; ref. 8). Raw data for individual subjects (previously published in aggregate; ref. 8) were used for present
analyses.
Gene Expression Assays
Laser capture microdissection, RNA amplification, and
microarray hybridization. We used frozen prostate samples
for laser capture microdissection (LCM) of benign tissue
(neoplastic tissue was not identified in a sufficient number
of frozen samples to allow analysis). We collected 2,000 to
3,000 benign epithelial cells per sample using the Arcturus
Veritas LCM System for isolation of total RNA followed by
two rounds of linear amplification as described (1, 9). Probe
pairs (2 μg amplified RNA from microdissected samples and
30 μg total RNA from a reference prostate cell line RNA pool)
were hybridized to custom cDNA microarrays as described
(1, 9). Fluorescence images were collected (GenePix 4000B,
Axon Instruments) and processed as described (10). We evaluated expression changes using two-sample t tests (Statistical
Analysis of Microarray4; ref. 11). False discovery rate (FDR)
less than 5% was considered significant. Microarray data can
be accessed via the Gene Expression Omnibus database
(GSM251831).
Cluster analysis. We performed unsupervised hierarchical
average linkage clustering using Cluster 3.0 software5 plotted
using TreeView6 version 1.6. We clustered samples using the
top 1,000 most variable genes from microarray expression
profiling (those with highest interquartile ratio, representing
the spread between the 75th and 25th percentile of expression data obtained for each gene) or using a custom list of
90 androgen-regulated genes (see below).
Generation of androgen-regulated gene list for clustering.
We included genes in the androgen-regulated set if they were
present in at least two of the following sources: NetPath
Androgen Receptor Pathway,7 a transcript profiling study
of androgen-mediated expression in LNCaP cells by Nelson
and colleagues (1), a transcript profiling study of androgen-

mediated expression in multiple prostate cell lines by DePrimo
and colleagues (≥3-fold change; ref. 12), and results from a
whole-genome Agilent microarray comparing LNCaP and
VCaP with or without the synthetic androgen R18818 (≥3-fold
change). The 90 genes generated by this analysis are presented
in Supplementary Fig. S1.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. We validated gene
expression changes using quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (qRT-PCR) in triplicate reactions using 5 ng cDNA,
1 μmol/L of each primer pair, and SYBR Green PCR master
mix (Applied Biosystems). We normalized mean cycle threshold (Ct) for each gene to a housekeeping gene, RPL13A, in the
same sample using the ΔCT method (primer sequences in
Supplementary Fig. S2).
Analysis of AR transcript expression in human prostate
samples. We used four human prostate microarray data sets
to compare AR expression in benign prostate tissue. These
consisted of 40 benign prostate samples adjacent to cancer analyzed on spotted 44K human cDNA microarrays by Lapointe
and colleagues (13); 50 benign prostate samples adjacent to
cancer analyzed on U95Av2 human Affymetrix arrays by Singh
and colleagues (14); 23 benign prostate samples from normal
donors plus 63 benign prostate samples adjacent to cancer
analyzed on Affymetrix U95a, U95b, and U95c chip sets by
Yu and colleagues (15); and 11 benign prostate samples on
U95Av2 human Affymetrix arrays analyzed by Glinsky and colleagues (16) All studies used bulk tissue. We analyzed two human prostate sample sets by qRT-PCR for AR expression in
microdissected benign prostate epithelium: the untreated
samples obtained from the dutasteride treatment study reported here and benign prostate epithelium in prostate biopsy
cores from 10 untreated individuals.
Immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence
In situ Hybridization
Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. A tissue
microarray (TMA) comprising benign and cancer tissue cores
from each patient (n = 81) was generously provided by
M. Gleave (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British
Columbia). Benign and cancer sites were each sampled thrice
(diameter, 0.6 mm), creating a triplet TMA layout (total,
426 cores). Sections (0.5 μm) were mounted on charged slides
for staining with TMPRSS2 (previously described; ref. 17) and
TFF3 (ab57752, 3 μg/mL; Abcam, Inc.). We individually scored
staining in each core on a four-point scale from none (0) to high
(3). We compared staining intensity in control and treatment
groups by fitting a logistic regression model using generalized
estimating equations to account for multiple observations per
patient; P values of <0.05 were considered significant.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for TMPRSS2ERG chromosomal fusion on the TMA using published probes
and methods (18). No cores without carcinoma exhibited a

Using less conservative DHT to testosterone potency ratios
of 5:1 or 10:1 resulted in a 70% to 80% and 80% to 90% difference in estimated tissue androgen activity between untreated
and dutasteride-treated samples (Table 1).
Dutasteride induces differential expression of androgenregulated genes in benign prostate epithelium. To assess
effects of SRD5A inhibition on prostate gene expression,
we microdissected benign epithelium from untreated and
dutasteride-treated cohorts and evaluated transcript expression using cDNA microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical
clustering using all genes did not discriminate treated and
untreated samples (data not shown). Clustering based on
the 1,000 most variably expressed genes similarly failed to
distinguish surgery alone and dutasteride-treated groups
(Fig. 1A) and failed to resolve high and low dutasteride cohorts from one another (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that
the overall effects of dutasteride on prostate gene expression
were modest and/or heterogeneous and therefore unable to
overcome the substantial variability in global transcript expression observed in untreated prostate epithelium.
However, direct comparison of prostatic gene expression in
untreated and dutasteride-treated samples using two-sample
t tests did reveal significant dutasteride-related alterations in
epithelial gene expression, with 120 genes ≥1.5-fold differentially regulated (FDR <5%; Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Among these, we observed significant alterations in expression of known androgen-regulated genes, including upregulation of IGFBP3 (3.7-fold) and downregulation of TMPRSS2,
KLK3 (PSA), KLK2, FKBP5, and KLK4 (1.8-, 1.8-, 2.0-, 2.1-, and
2.6-fold, respectively), confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2B).
Variability in the molecular response to SRD5A inhibition distinguishes patients with high and low androgenresponsive programs. A primary measure of the tissue response
to dutasteride should be an effect on the cellular androgen
axis, as reflected by tissue AR activity. Although expression

TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. We tabulated fusion status for TMA
cores containing cancer blinded to treatment group. We determined significance between treatment groups using a logistic
regression model [log(p / (1 − p)) = B0 + B1x1, where p denotes
probability of fusion and x1 denotes dutasteride dose] and fit
using generalized estimating equations to account for multiple cores as well as different numbers of observations per subject due to loss of cores or absence of cancer.

Results
Serum and prostatic androgen concentrations after dutasteride treatment. To evaluate molecular effects of SRD5A
inhibition in vivo, we studied prostate tissues from a clinical
trial of dutasteride before RP (8). Eighty-one men aged 45 to
80 years with localized PCa (T1c-T2b), Gleason score of ≤7,
and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 2.5 to 10 ng/dL were
randomized to immediate RP (n = 25) or four months of 0.5
mg dutasteride (n = 26) or 3.5 mg dutasteride (n = 24) orally
daily preceding RP.
The proposed mechanism of SRD5A inhibition in PCa
chemoprevention is based on an overall reduction in prostate
tissue androgens and attendant decrement in AR activity. Accordingly, dutasteride-treated subjects had significantly lower serum and tissue DHT levels than untreated men (Table 1;
ref. 8). Compared with untreated samples (3.33 ng/g), prostatic DHT was 93% and 98.8% lower in 0.5 mg (0.23 ng/g) and
3.5 mg (0.04 ng/g) groups, respectively. We observed reciprocal
increases in tissue testosterone due to inhibition of SRD5A
activity in dutasteride-treated samples. Using a conservative
estimate that relative potency of DHT in engaging and maintaining AR activity is twice that of testosterone (19), a “tissue
androgen index” (sum of testosterone plus 2× DHT) suggests
that overall tissue androgen activity in dutasteride-treated
samples is reduced by approximately 40% to 60% (Table 1).

Molecular Response to SRD5A Inhibition

Figure 1. Unsupervised clustering of
untreated and dutasteride–treated samples
based on prostate epithelial gene expression.
Samples from patients undergoing surgery
alone (black squares) or treated with
0.5 or 3.5 mg of dutasteride (Dut; white

on unsupervised clustering using the
1,000 most variably expressed genes.

profiling identified significant dutasteride-related differences
in expression of many androgen-regulated genes, substantial
heterogeneity among individuals was evident (Fig. 2B). Many
dutasteride-treated samples expressed transcripts for androgenregulated genes within ranges measured in untreated samples
and unrelated to treatment dose (Fig. 2B). Moreover, despite
significantly lower DHT levels in the 3.5 mg than 0.5 mg cohort
[0.04 (±0.02) ng/g versus 0.23 (±0.12) ng/g; P < 0.0001; Table 1],
we did not identify differentially regulated genes between the
3.5 mg versus 0.5 mg dutasteride-treated groups (data not
shown). These results suggest that AR-mediated transcription
reflects the total tissue androgen state and not absolute tissue
DHT concentration such that lower tissue DHT in the 3.5 mg
group may potentially be attenuated by increases in tissue testosterone. This conclusion is consistent with relatively similar
overall estimates of tissue androgen indices in the two dutasteride-treated cohorts (Table 1).
To more specifically interrogate the effect of SRD5A inhibition on the prostatic AR axis, we evaluated dutasteride-treated
samples for expression of 90 androgen-regulated genes (Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 1, 12). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on expression of these androgen-regulated genes
resolved dutasteride-treated samples into two groups distinguished by markedly different expression levels of genes
known to be highly responsive to androgen (FOLH1, NKX3-1,
TMPRSS2, KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, and PPAP2A; Fig. 3A), as well as
expression of the AR itself. We designated these cohorts ARGHi (AR gene activity-high) and ARG-Lo (AR gene activity-low).
Unsupervised clustering of the entire sample set (including untreated cases) using the same 90 androgen-regulated genes
provided a near-identical segregation of treated samples
and placed 7 of 11 untreated samples into the ARG-Hi group
(Fig. 3B). Of interest in context of subsequent analyses, three of
four untreated samples falling into the ARG-Lo group were
among untreated samples with the lowest AR mRNA expression.
Variation in tissue response to dutasteride might simply
reflect differences in efficacy of SRD5A inhibition, thus correlating with intraprostatic DHT levels or the calculated androgen index. However, dutasteride was uniformly effective in
reducing prostatic DHT, with no DHT levels in treated samples exceeding untreated samples (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Testosterone levels were more variable, as were measures of
the estimated androgen index (Supplementary Fig. S4B–E).
However, plotting samples by tissue DHT, testosterone, or
the calculated androgen index did not correlate with segre-

gation into ARG-Lo or ARG-Hi cohorts (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Accordingly, we found no differences in expression of
SRD5A1, SRD5A2, or SRD5A3 in ARG-Lo or ARG-Hi groups
(Supplementary Fig. S6), nor any difference in SRD5A2 singlenucleotide polymorphism alleles known to modulate SRD5A2
functional activity (including A49T, P48R, V89L, and F194L; data
not shown; refs. 20, 21). Thus, we could not attribute observed
variation in AR-responsive genes to differences in dutasteride
effects on DHT reduction.
SRD5A effects on the AR program are highly correlated
with cellular AR expression and weakly associated with
tissue androgen levels. To further examine prostatic androgen responses to dutasteride, we identified genes in ARG-Hi
and ARG-Lo groups most closely associated with sample segregation. With one exception, simply ordering dutasteridetreated samples based solely on AR mRNA abundance partitioned samples into the same ARG-Hi and ARG-Lo categories
(Fig. 3C) identified by clustering of samples with the 90 androgenregulated genes (Fig. 3A). Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that
segregation of dutasteride-treated samples into ARG-Hi and
ARG-Lo groups similarly showed relatively high and low expression of AR, PSA, and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, PSA
and TMPRSS2 showed a highly significant correlation with
AR transcript expression [r2 = 0.45 (P < 0.001) and r2 = 0.52
(P < 0.0001), respectively; Fig. 4B]. Accordingly, known ARregulated genes predominated among those whose microarray
expression profile was most strongly correlated with AR transcript expression (Supplementary Fig. S7).
In contrast, we observed a much weaker correlation between androgen-regulated genes and tissue androgen levels.
Plotting transcript levels against tissue DHT, testosterone, or
androgen index yielded modestly significant correlations between TMPRSS2 and DHT (r2 = 0.21; P = 0.04) and androgen
index (r2 = 0.28; P = 0.01), whereas correlations for PSA only
trended toward significance (P = 0.06 and 0.08, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S8). In addition, we observed no differences in
polyQ and polyG trinucleotide repeats (associated with AR
transactivating capacity) in ARG-Lo and ARG-Hi groups (data
not shown; refs. 22, 23). These observations suggest that the
primary driver of prostatic androgen response in dutasteridetreated tissues is the level of AR itself.
Although AR activity (measured by epithelial expression of
androgen-regulated genes) correlated closely with AR transcript levels, it is unknown whether variable AR expression
in dutasteride-treated samples reflects steady-state AR status

or if a subset of subjects responds to decreased androgen
levels caused by SRD5A inhibition by modulating AR transcript synthesis or stability. As this study did not include pretreatment and posttreatment samples, we cannot directly
address this possibility. However, the wide variation in AR
transcript levels in untreated subjects suggests that “intrinsic”
AR levels could account for the range of AR expression ob-

served in dutasteride-treated samples. To confirm that AR levels normally exhibit substantial variability, we examined AR
transcript abundance in four published microarray data sets
(13–16) and in microdissected benign epithelium from
untreated prostatectomy (n = 12) and needle biopsy (n = 10)
specimens. Consistent with the range of AR expression
observed in the present study, AR abundance in untreated

prostate samples from published data sets ranged 16-fold
(Supplementary Fig. S9).
As SRD5A inhibition has been associated with histopathologic measures of epithelial cell atrophy in some (but not all)
studies (6, 8, 24–26), we examined whether differences in AR
transcript expression between ARG-Lo and ARG-Hi cohorts
might reflect a differential induction of luminal cell atrophy,
with relative loss of AR-expressing luminal cells but continued
presence of AR-negative basal cells in the ARG-Lo cohort. We

found no consistent difference in expression of four basal
(TP63, CD44, KRT5, and KRT7) or four luminal cell markers
(KRT8, KRT14, KRT17, and KRT18) between ARG-Lo and
ARG-Hi cohorts (by qRT-PCR; data not shown), nor did we observe histopathologic differences in relative proportion of epithelial glands showing microcystic atrophy (data not shown).
SRD5A inhibition affects TMPRSS2 expression in
cancerous epithelium. Although androgens and the AR are
clearly associated with PCa development and progression,

determining specific androgen-regulated genes directly contributing to carcinogenesis has proven elusive. To assess potential functional importance of dutasteride-associated
transcriptional changes, we evaluated protein expression of
trefoil factor 3 (TFF3; downregulated 2.1-fold by dutasteride;
Fig. 2A) and TMPRSS2, epithelial genes implicated in PCa genesis and/or progression (17, 18, 27, 28). As previously observed,
TFF3 exhibited a spectrum of expression with more intense
staining in cancer than benign epithelium (27). Expression
was generally low in control samples and further decreased
by dutasteride (Fig. 5A and C), with no effect of dutasteride
in cancer tissue. TMPRSS2 also stained more intensely in cancer than benign epithelium, with dutasteride reducing staining
intensity in both benign and cancer tissues (Fig. 5B and C).
The significant, albeit modest, dutasteride-associated
reductions in TMPRSS2 transcript and protein levels are noteworthy in view of the frequent chromosomal rearrangements
found in PCa and preneoplastic lesions placing ETS oncogene
family members under control of genes with androgenregulated promoters such as TMPRSS2 (18). To evaluate potential effects of dutasteride on oncogenic events driven by

these rearrangements, we assessed TMPRSS2-ERG fusion status using FISH analysis of triplicate cancer cores per patient.
Of samples with sufficient cancer for analysis, we identified the
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in 49% of cancer cores from untreated
patients (n = 19 evaluable) and in 57% and 25% of the low-dose
(n = 18 evaluable) and high-dose (n = 16 evaluable) dutasteride-treated groups, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S10A;
the number of positive and negative cores for each case is
given in Supplementary Fig. S10B). The frequency of fusionpositive cancer cores was significantly lower in high-dose
dutasteride versus untreated samples (P = 0.048). The significance of this observation is uncertain given the relatively
short duration of dutasteride treatment before prostatectomy
but is consistent with the hypothesis that cancers harboring
TMPRSS2-ERG fusions may be sensitive to modulation by
dutasteride.

Molecular Response to SRD5A Inhibition

Figure 5. Analysis of TFF3 and TMPRSS2 expression in neoplastic
prostate epithelium. TFF3 and TMPRSS2 expression was evaluated
using a TMA comprising triplicate benign and cancer cores per patient.
Staining was scored on a four-point scale from none (0) to high (3).
The distribution of cores in each treatment group displaying no (0),
low (1), moderate (2), or high (3) intensity staining is shown for TFF3
(A) and TMPRSS2 (B). Staining intensity in control and treatment
groups was compared using a logistic regression model to account
for multiple observations per patient, with statistically significant
changes indicated (*). Decreases in TFF3 staining were significant
in the benign tissue (dutasteride 3.5 mg group; P < 0.01) and for
TMPRSS2 in the benign (3.5 mg dutasteride group; P = 0.03) and
cancer tissue (0.5 mg dutasteride, P = 0.04; 3.5 mg dutasteride; P = 0.02).

might be achieved by decreasing the rate at which relatively
indolent foci of malignancy (present in the majority of men
with advancing age) progress to clinically detectable disease
(30). Increasingly, there is momentum to “treat” these common low-grade cancers with surveillance plans incorporating
administration of natural products or pharmaceuticals with
minimal side effects and low attendant risk profiles (6, 31). In

this context, evaluation of SRD5A inhibitors has a strong rationale centered on a mechanism-based role for androgens
and the AR in maintaining physiologic functions of benign
and neoplastic prostate epithelium.
The PCPT formally tested the hypothesis that decreasing
SRD5A activity would lower PCa incidence. Compared with
placebo, finasteride reduced the 7-year period prevalence of
PCa by 25% (5). However, 803 of 4,368 (∼18%) finasteridetreated men were diagnosed with PCas spanning low- and
high-grade histologies, as were ∼16% of dutasteride-treated
men in the REDUCE study (7). Many unexplained questions
remain about preventive versus regressive effects of SRD5A
inhibition on PCa development and progression. Importantly, it is unknown why SRD5A inhibition was not effective
in all individuals nor what factors underlie the variable outcomes observed.
Finasteride and dutasteride substantially reduce intraprostatic DHT levels and have been shown to reduce prostate
volume and improve voiding symptoms related to benign
prostatic hypertrophy (32–36). However, measurable effects
of these agents toward prostate epithelium and vasculature
are not consistent. Remarkably, studies including analyses of
prostate samples from the PCPT (6) have documented that
histologic assessments are not capable of distinguishing tissues treated with SRD5A inhibitors versus placebo. A report
by the Proscar Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study group
concluded that no significant histologic differences were discernible in either benign or cancerous prostate tissues when
comparing finasteride and placebo (24). Randomized studies
of dutasteride treatment have not found reproducible associations with measures of microvessel density, epithelial cell
atrophy, proliferation rates, or apoptosis (8, 25). Although
these results may partly reflect the substantial normal variability in aging-related androgen decline and attendant tissue
effects in untreated individuals, other influences may inhibit
or accentuate responses to SRD5A inhibitors, with biological
consequences important for the efficacy of this strategy in
PCa prevention and treatment.
In this study, we identified several possible mechanisms by
which dutasteride could modify the development and progression of PCa. Several gene products with known roles or
associations with prostate carcinogenesis were altered by dutasteride therapy: prostate epithelium from treated subjects
expressed elevated levels of IGFBP3 transcripts (37) and lower levels of TFF3 (27, 28) and TMPRSS2 (10, 17). Reduced
TMPRSS2 expression is particularly relevant in view of recurrent genomic rearrangements involving TMPRSS2 and
members of the ETS oncogene family that occur in >50% of
all PCas (18). In support of the hypothesis that cancers harboring TMPRSS2-ETS family rearrangements may be driven
by AR signaling, we found that the frequency of cancers with
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was reduced in the cohort of patients
treated with high-dose dutasteride, although the implication
of this observation is limited by the relatively small sample
size and short treatment duration.
Importantly, the substantial degree of heterogeneity in the
molecular response to dutasteride therapy was unanticipated.
Despite near-uniform reduction of tissue DHT levels to the

lowest limits of assay detection, many dutasteride-treated
tissues continued to exhibit robust activity of the AR gene expression program. Moreover, we found only weak associations
between AR activity and measures of tissue testosterone, DHT,
or a composite metric of androgen concentrations. Notably,
the molecular feature most closely associated with status of
the AR expression program was the level of AR itself.
AR expression levels have previously been found to contribute to the development of castration-resistant PCa. Using
isogenic PCa xenograft models, Chen and colleagues (38)
found that a modest increase in AR was the only change consistently associated with development of resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Elevated AR levels converted cancers
from androgen sensitive to castration resistant, with cancer
growth proceeding by enhanced output of the signal contributed by low residual androgens.
Although oncogenic events such as AR gene amplification
or dysregulated kinase signaling may lead to increased AR
transcript expression in PCa (39, 40), our studies of benign
epithelium shows that a wide range of AR expression normally
exists (or can be induced) in prostatic epithelium without a
requirement for aberrant genomic or epigenetic events that
accompany neoplastic growth. The wild-type AR gene has
been shown to function as a self-regulating transcription factor capable of binding to response elements within its coding
region, leading to increased mRNA levels (41). Thus, natural
variations in levels of coactivator/corepressors or polymorphisms involving genomic regulatory sites in the AR itself may
contribute to intrinsic differences in AR regulation.
A potential limitation of our study is that we evaluated the
molecular effect of SRD5A inhibition on benign epithelium of
men with known PCa. However, a study evaluating chemoprevention in subjects without known cancer is also likely
to harbor a certain percentage of men with undiagnosed
PCa (as shown by the PCPT). Moreover, emerging data implicate a field cancerization effect underlying multifocal PCa
development (42), suggesting that our findings in benignappearing epithelium of men with cancer are likely to be
relevant to the effect of SRD5A inhibition in modulating progression of premalignant lesions to overt cancer.

Variation in the molecular program of AR gene regulation
has important implications for the optimal use of SRD5A
inhibitors in PCa prevention and treatment. Our data suggest
the hypothesis that under conditions of relative androgen
depletion, high AR levels in benign prostate epithelium can
maintain AR transcriptional network activity, whereas low
AR levels cannot compensate for low ligand concentrations.
The lack of compensatory ability in some individuals could
affect development and/or progression of initiated/
preneoplastic prostate lesions (possibly those harboring an
androgen-driven TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement). Although
mechanisms responsible for variation in AR transcript expression have not been defined, our data lead to the hypothesis that pretreatment tissue AR levels may predict response
to SRD5A-directed therapies, a question that can be tested in
an appropriately designed clinical study.
