Abstract
Analysis of the Polyp Prevention Trial showed an association between an isorhamnetin-rich diet and a reduced
risk of advanced adenoma recurrence; however, the mechanism behind the chemoprotective effects of
isorhamnetin remains unclear. Here, we show that isorhamnetin prevents colorectal tumorigenesis of FVB/N
mice treated with the chemical carcinogen azoxymethane and subsequently exposed to colonic irritant dextran
sodium sulfate (DSS). Dietary isorhamnetin decreased mortality, tumor number, and tumor burden by 62%,
35%, and 59%, respectively. MRI, histopathology, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that dietary
isorhamnetin resolved the DSS-induced inﬂammatory response faster than the control diet. Isorhamnetin
inhibited AOM/DSS–induced oncogenic c-Src activation and b-catenin nuclear translocation, while promoting
the expression of C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), a negative regulator of Src family of tyrosine kinases. Similarly, in
HT-29 colon cancer cells, isorhamnetin inhibited oncogenic Src activity and b-catenin nuclear translocation by
inducing expression of csk, as veriﬁed by RNA interference knockdown of csk. Our observations suggest the
chemoprotective effects of isorhamnetin in colon cancer are linked to its anti-inﬂammatory activities and its
inhibition of oncogenic Src activity and consequential loss of nuclear b-catenin, activities that are dependent on
CSK expression. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5473–84. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed
type of cancer in the United States, and it is the second leading
cause of cancer-related deaths (1). Chronic inﬂammation, such
as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, are associated with
increased risk of colorectal cancer (2–5).
The Src family of tyrosine kinases (SFK) are nonreceptor
protein tyrosine kinases that are activated in multiple cancers, including colorectal cancer (6). Increased Src activity in
primary colorectal cancer is an indicator of poor prognosis

(7). C-terminal Src kinase, also known as c-Src kinase (CSK),
negatively regulates SFK by phosphorylation of a C-terminal
tyrosine (Y530 in c-Src; ref. 8). C-terminal phosphorylation of
SFK stabilizes the protein in an inhibitory conﬁrmation that
prevents autophosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine
(Y419 in c-Src). The receptor-like tyrosine phosphatase CD45
and similar phosphatases impose a reciprocal regulation of
Src by removing the C-terminal tyrosine phosphate (9).
Activated Src can regulate many downstream pathways
including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Ras–Mek–extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), STAT3, and p130 to
increase survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, motility, and
invasion (6). Activated Src can also phosphorylate b-catenin,
causing its release from E-cadherin sequestration at the plasma membrane and enhancing its nuclear localization (10).
Colorectal cancer seems to be sensitive to loss of Src regulation.
Both the loss of expression of the negative regulator CSK and
the overexpression of Src have been implicated in colorectal
carcinogenesis (8).
The cost of treating colorectal cancer is estimated to be $6.5
billion per year (11). Dietary change and use of dietary supplements, both feasible and safe, represent a viable and important
strategy for preventing colorectal cancer (12). Recent analysis
of the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT), a clinical trial that investigated the role of diet modulation in the prevention of
colorectal adenoma recurrence, suggested that consuming an
isorhamnetin-rich diet was associated with a decreased risk of
advanced adenoma recurrence (13).

sorted by change in body weight into ﬁve diet groups to ensure
that effects of the DSS were evenly represented in each of the
different diets. Mice were single caged and started on the
indicated diet (day 17; Supplementary Table S1). Isorhamnetin
and myricetin were obtained from Jinan Haohua Industry Co.,
Ltd. and quercetin and rutin were obtained from SigmaAldrich Co., LLC. Puriﬁed diets were prepared by Harlan
Laboratories. Mice were allowed to eat ad libitum. One day
before euthanasia (days 20, 25, and 33), 12 mice per group and
time point were imaged by MRI as described previously (15).
Mice were euthanized at indicated times and colon tissue was
collected.

Recently, it was shown that isorhamnetin can suppress skin
cancer by binding to and inhibiting MAP (mitogen-activated
protein)/ERK kinase (MEK) 1 and PI3K (14). To further investigate the potential role of ﬂavonols in colorectal cancer
prevention, we assessed the effects of four ﬂavonols commonly
consumed by humans, isorhamnetin, quercetin, rutin, and
myricetin, in a mouse model for colorectal cancer. We found
that supplementing the diet with isorhamnetin signiﬁcantly
reduced colorectal tumorigenesis in these mice. The isorhamnetin diet seemed to resolve the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)–
induced inﬂammation as measured by MRI, histopathology,
and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC). Isorhamnetin also
inhibited Src activity and nuclear localization of b-catenin and
increased expression of CSK both in vivo and in colorectal
carcinoma cells. Finally, we showed that inhibition of Src and
nuclear b-catenin was dependent on the upregulation of CSK
in colon cancer cells and associated with CSK expression in
isorhamnetin-fed mice.

Histopathology
Colonic tissue was harvested from mice at various times
after azoxymethane or AOM/DSS treatment, ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde overnight, and stored in 70% ethanol. Fixed sections
of colonic tissues were embedded in parafﬁn, cut into 5-mm
sections, and put onto microscopic slides by Histoserv Inc.
Slides were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
for histologic analysis via light microscopy or deparafﬁnized in
xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol for IHC. For histopathology analysis, a section of approximately 5 mm in length
of the distal colon was evaluated for each animal. The tissues
were blinded and scored by the pathologist semiquantitatively
from 0 to 15 (Supplementary Table S2). Colons were evaluated
beginning at the colorectal junction and proceeding adorally 5
mm to the middle colon. Brieﬂy, the severity of the leukocytic
inﬁltrate in the mucosa was subjectively assessed as mild,
moderate, or severe (1, 2, and 3, respectively); the distribution
was evaluated and denoted as focal/locally extensive, multifocal, or diffuse (1, 2, and 3, respectively); and the depth was
evaluated and denoted as mucosa only, extends to submucosa,
or extends to muscularis mucosa or serosa (1, 2, and 3,
respectively). The distribution of atypical glandular hyperplasia (AGH)/squamous (sq) metaplasia was assessed as focal,
multifocal, or diffuse (1, 2, and 3, respectively). The distribution

Materials and Methods
Animal studies
All mouse experiments were agreed to and regulated by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cancer
Institute (Frederick, MD). Pathogen-free male FVB/N mice
were purchased from the NCI-Frederick Animal Production
Area at 5 weeks of age and were exposed to a 12:12–hour light/
dark cycle. Mice were given an AIN-96G–puriﬁed diet from
Harlan Teklad and drinking water ad libitum. At 6 weeks of age
(day 0; Fig. 1), mice were injected intraperitoneally with
azoxymethane (Sigma) at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight in
0.1 mL of saline (Fig. 1). Seven days later, mice were treated
with 2% DSS, 36,000 to 50,000 kDa (MP Biomedicals LL),
dissolved in normal drinking water (reverse osmosis–puriﬁed
water) for 7 days and then switched back to normal drinking
water. Body weights were measured during the DSS treatment.

Isorhamnetin-Induced CSK Inhibits Colorectal Cancer

of ulceration was assessed as focal, multifocal, or diffuse (1, 2,
and 3, respectively). If necrosis was present it was subjectively
assessed as mild, moderate, or severe and scored accordingly
(1, 2, and 3, respectively). A score of 0 was assigned for each
criterion not represented in the section, which was the case for
the majority of mice for ulceration and necrosis. Total disease
score per mouse was calculated by summation of the six
parameters for each mouse.
Immunohistochemistry
For IHC, the sections were placed in low-pH–modiﬁed
citrate buffer (Dako) and subjected to antigen retrieval via
pressure chamber. The sections were preincubated in 3% H2O2
for 20 minutes and blocked in normal goat serum for 1 hour.
Sections were incubated overnight in primary antibody solution diluted as follows: Ki-67, phospho-b-catenin654 (Abcam
Laboratories) 1:50, CD45 (BD Biosciences) 1:50, pSrcY417 and
b-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology) 1:100 and 1:1,000, respectively. Slides were incubated for 1 hour in a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:200. The sections were
treated with a Vectorstain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories); the
resulting activity was detected with diaminobenzidine (Sigma)
and counterstained in hematoxylin. For CSK (Abcam Laboratories), tissues were incubated 1:50 for 1 hour and detected
with a Ventana iView DAB detection kit (Ventana Medical
Systems) on a Ventana BenchMark.
Cell culture
Human colon cancer HT29 cell line was obtained from
American Type Culture Collection and cultured as described
previously (16).
Western blot analysis
HT29 cells were seeded on 100-mm plates and treated with
either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle (<1%) or isorhamnetin (10, 20, and 40 mmol/L) for 24 hours. The media was
removed and cells were washed with cold PBS. Cells were lysed
with complete radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis
buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein concentration was
calculated using standard bovine serum albumin (BSA) curve.
Approximately, 30 to 80 mg of protein was loaded and separated
by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and
probed with the following antibodies at indicated dilutions:
CSK (1:1,000), pSRC417 (1:1,000), pSRC529 (1:1,000), b-catenin
(1:2,000), pAKT (1:1,000), pERK (1:2,000), E-cadherin (1:1,000),
pGSK3ab (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), and pb-catenin654 (Abcam Laboratories) overnight at 4 C, followed by
incubation in horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibodies for 1 hour. Cells were developed with SuperSignal West
Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Each
membrane was probed with b-actin (1:5,000; Sigma) to ensure
consistent protein loading.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA from HT29 cultured cells was isolated using
TRIzol RNA extraction method. Brieﬂy, chloroform was
added to the sample, and after shaking and centrifugation
the aqueous layer was isolated. Isopropanol was next added

www.aacrjournals.org

to the sample to precipitate the RNA. Following centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. RNA
was further puriﬁed using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The
cDNA was synthesized using Bio-Rad iScript reverse transcriptase, and the PCR reactions were carried out using BioRad SYBR Green Master Mix carried out in Bio-Rad iCycler
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). The human csk splicing variant 1
and 2 were purchased from IDT and sequence is as follows:
sense, 50 -TCCGGCCCCGTCTCTCTTGG and antisense, 50 ACCCTCACGGGCAGGACAGG. The PCR included nontemplate control and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) as control primer set. The csk transcript
activity level was calculated using 2DDCT , where DCT ¼
CT csk  CT gapdh and D (DCT stimulated  DCT control).
CSK siRNA construct
HT29 cells were stably transfected with three unique 27mer
siRNA duplexes—2 nmol each against csk siRNA (Trilencer-27;
Origene Technologies) or a scrambled control siRNA using the
manufacturer's transfection reagent and recommendations.
After transfection, cells were incubated for 36 hours. The total
protein was isolated and subjected to Western blot analysis.
Soft agar assay
HT29 cells were seeded onto 100-mm plates and pretreated
with either DMSO vehicle (<1%) or isorhamnetin (10, 20, and 40
mmol/L) for 24 hours. Cells were trypsinized and seeded at
30,000 cells in 2 Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM).
Cell suspension was added 1:1 with 0.5% agarose (2 mL/well in
a 6-well plate) and constitutes the top layer. The bottom layer
consisted of 2 mL of 1.2% agarose. The cells were maintained in
an incubator for 14 days and the colonies were scanned and
counted with GelCount (Oxford Optronix Ltd.).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were done using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS,
Inc.) software. A Student unpaired t test was used to compare
treatment group averages for histopathology and cell culture
data. Generalized linear models were used to compare treatment group averages for mouse morbidity (binomial; PROC
GLIMMIX) and tumor data (PROC GLM). In addition to diet,
the number of DSS rounds was also included in the linear
models. To achieve normality, tumor number was natural log–
transformed and tumor burden and size were twice natural
log–transformed, after adding a 1 to prevent values below zero.
Histopathology and cell culture data are shown as raw mean
and their SEs; tumor data are shown as least-squares mean and
their SEs, which were back transformed to their original scale.
All statistical tests were two-sided. The P values were not
adjusted for multiple comparisons. Signiﬁcance was declared
at P  0.05 and a tendency at 0.05 to 0.10.

of advanced adenoma recurrence (13, 17). To verify the chemoprotective effects of individual ﬂavonols on colorectal
tumorigenesis, we fed FVB/N male mice previously treated
with azoxymethane and DSS, diets enriched with four primary
ﬂavonols consumed by humans (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table S1). FVB/N mice are sensitive to the AOM/DSS and only
require one cycle of DSS to promote tumorigenesis. Three days
after the DSS treatment, mice were started on an AIN93-G
control diet (18) or one supplemented with the indicated
ﬂavonol. Sensitive strains of mice treated with azoxymethane
and 1 week of DSS will develop colon dysplastic lesions,
adenomas, and adenocarcinomas; unfortunately some of these
mice will have to be euthanized prematurely due to the large
tumor burden and colorectal prolapse (15, 19). In our study,
feeding mice isorhamnetin after the DSS exposure produced a
signiﬁcantly higher survival rate (80%) compared with the mice
fed the control diet (48%, P ¼ 0.02; Table 1). The isorhamnetinfed mice also developed 35% (P ¼ 0.03) fewer tumors and a 59%
(P ¼ 0.04) smaller tumor burden than mice fed the control diet
(Table 1). Because the decreased mortality and tumor number
in the quercetin intervention was not signiﬁcant and we saw no
beneﬁcial effects with rutin or myricetin diets, we conducted
an in-depth study of the isorhamnetin intervention. A repeat of
the isorhamnetin intervention showed 63% decrease in tumor
number (P ¼ 0.002) and an 83% decrease in tumor burden (P ¼
0.02; Fig. 1). In this study, tumors did not progress to adenocarcinoma on either of the diet interventions. These data
indicate that a diet supplemented with isorhamnetin prevents
colorectal tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.
Isorhamnetin resolves colitis faster in AOM/DSS–treated
mice
FVB/N mice exposed to one cycle of DSS will develop colitis
that can be detected by MRI (15). Mice treated with AOM/DSS
were imaged on day 20, 25, and 33 (Fig. 1) using MRI before and
after i.v. administration of 0.2 mmol/kg gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacid (Gd-DTPA) contrast agent (Fig. 2). In

5476

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

normal colons, little to no contrast was detected in the colonic
epithelium (15), whereas in DSS-treated mice, the contrast
agent clearly reached the epithelial lining of the colon, indicating colitis at day 20 in both diet groups (Fig. 2A, left). By day
25, colitis increased in mice fed both diets; however, colitis
was less severe in mice fed isorhamnetin (Fig. 2A, middle). By
day 33, isorhamnetin-fed mice had less uptake of contrast
agent in the colonic epithelium as compared with mice fed the
control diet, indicating colitis had begun to resolve in these
mice (Fig. 2A, right).
Histopathology analysis of the colonic tissue collected 1 day
after MRI (days 21, 26, and 34) conﬁrmed the results of the
imaging (Fig. 2B). Regardless of day of sacriﬁce (no time  diet
interaction at P < 0.20), dietary isorhamnetin decreased leukocyte distribution (P ¼ 0.003), depth (P ¼ 0.07), and severity
(P ¼ 0.11) of inﬂammation, and the distribution of AGH or
squamous metaplasia (P ¼ 0.02), resulting in an overall lower
histopathology score for isorhamnetin-fed mice (P ¼ 0.02). The
severity and distribution of inﬂammation was similar in the
mice on days 21 and 26, irrespective of the diet. By day 34,
however, the mice fed the isorhamnetin diet showed only
localized or multifocal distribution of leukocytes with mild to
moderate severity, whereas the mice fed the control diet still
exhibited moderate to severe inﬂammation, which was distributed diffusely within the section of colon evaluated (Fig.
2B). Colons collected at days 21 and 26 from mice fed both the
control and isorhamnetin diet showed AGH and squamous
metaplasia conﬁned to the colorectal area in most sections. By
day 34, the colons of the mice that were fed the control diet had
a higher rate of microadenoma formation and a greater degree
of hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, which are considered
premalignant lesions, as compared with the mice fed the
isorhamnetin diet. Unlike in our previous study (15), no
adenocarcinoma was detected in this study in either group.
These results suggest that the mice on the isorhamnetin diet
recovered from colitis faster than the mice on the control diet
and further suggest a chemopreventive effect of isorhamnetin
on colorectal tumorigenesis.

Figure 2. Isorhamnetin (IsR) inhibited AOM/DSS–induced inﬂammation. A, MRI showed decreased inﬂammation in isorhamnetin-fed mice. On days 20, 25, and
33, 12 mice per group were imaged by MRI. Two T1 weighted postcontrast representative images are shown for each diet and time point. Coronal, sagittal, and
axial views are shown for the indicated mouse (m). Arrowheads show Gd-DTPA localized to the epithelial tissue. Arrow shows region of coronal view
used to generate the axial view. Ct, control diet. B, histopathology showed a decrease in inﬂammation in isorhamnetin-fed mice. Colorectal tissues
collected on the indicated days were stained with H&E and evaluated for the degree of inﬂammation and colonic tissue damage produced after AOM/DSS
exposure. The tissues were scored for the degree of inﬂammation with criteria of 0, 1, 2, or 3, where 1 ¼ focal/locally, 2 ¼ multifocal, and 3 ¼ diffuse
for distribution of leukocytes; for AGH/Sq metaplasia and distribution of epithelial erosion/ulceration (data not shown), 1 ¼ mild, 2 ¼ moderate, and 3 ¼ severe
for severity of inﬁltrated and for severity of necrosis (data not shown); and for depth of inﬂammation, 1 ¼ mucosa only, 2 ¼ extends to submucosa,
and 3 ¼ extends to muscularis mucosa or serosa. A score of 0 was assigned for each criterion not represented in the section. Data for epithelial erosion and
necrosis are not shown because only a minority of mice showed this feature. The overall score is the accumulation of the six individual equally weighted scores
(maximum total 18). C, anti-CD45 (1:50) IHC showed isorhamnetin-decreased inﬂammation. Gut-associated-lymphoid tissue (GALT) is seen in
azoxymethane only on day 31 mice (top, 1) and AOM/DSS isorhamnetin on day 34 mice (bottom, 1). In the AOM/DSS mice on control diet, CD45-positive cells
show inﬁltration. GALT was not detected in these mice (middle).

gut-associated-lymphoid tissue (GALT) in mice fed isorhamnetin, similar to what is seen in mice not exposed to DSS. The
GALT provides immune protection to the gut (20). These results
suggest that isorhamnetin prevents the release of CD45-positive
leukocytes. Consistent with the histopathology and MRI data
(Fig. 2A and B), the decrease in CD45-positive leukocyte inﬁltration indicates that mice on the isorhamnetin diet recover
more quickly from the colitis than do mice fed the control diet.

sion in the isorhamnetin-treated mice was predominantly in
the basal portion of the colon crypt that contains multipotent
stem cells (21), whereas in mice fed the control diet, Ki-67
expression showed aberrant cell proliferation throughout the
crypts. Similar results were seen at day 59 (Fig. 3), indicating
that the mice on the control diet never completely recovered
from the DSS-induced proliferation. The decrease in proliferation suggests that the mice on the isorhamnetin diet recover
more quickly from the inﬂammation-induced cell proliferation
response in the colon.

Isorhamnetin reduces cell proliferation in AOM/DSS–
treated mice
To assess the effects of the isorhamnetin diet on cell
proliferation, Ki-67 expression was evaluated by IHC on day
34 in the colon tissue of AOM/DSS–treated mice. Mice fed the
isorhamnetin diet had a 16% crypt proliferation fraction compared with mice on the control diet with a crypt proliferation
fraction of 63% (P < 0.001; Fig. 3). Furthermore, Ki-67 expres-

model, human colorectal carcinoma cell lines were treated
with varying concentrations of isorhamnetin. Treatment
of HT29 cells showed no effect on cell viability with up to
40 mmol/L isorhamnetin and very little effect with up to 100

S2). At 40 mmol/L, isorhamnetin signiﬁcantly inhibited anchorage-independent growth of HT29 cells by 62% (P ¼ 0.001)
compared with solvent control (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
results suggest that isorhamnetin at 40 mmol/L can inhibit
tumorigenesis without signiﬁcantly affecting cell viability.

we did not see inhibition of S6kinase phosphorylation, a target

tyrosine 529, leading to autophosphorylation at tyrosine 417
and activation of Src. Here, we show a dose-dependent inhibition of Src Y417 phosphorylation by isorhamnetin (Fig. 4A).
Conversely, a dose-dependent increase was shown in Src Y529
phosphorylation. Src activation was inhibited by isorhamnetin
in a dose-dependent manner with a 34% inhibition (increase in
Y529 phosphorylation) at 40 mmol/L.

Isorhamnetin induces csk expression
Because tyrosine 529 on Src is phosphorylated by CSK, we
examined the effect of isorhamnetin on CSK. Isorhamnetin
induced a dose-dependent increase in CSK mRNA (2.2fold change at 40 mmol/L) and protein (2.6-fold change at
40 mmol/L; Fig. 4B). Isorhamnetin at 40 mmol/L also induced
CSK expression in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 (data
not shown). These results indicate that isorhamnetin activates gene expression of csk, leading to inhibition of Src
activity.
Isorhamnetin inhibition of ERK, Akt, and Src activity is
CSK dependent
To determine if the isorhamnetin inhibition of Src is
dependent on CSK expression, we knocked down csk expression with siRNA and assessed Src activity. Transfection
with the control siRNA (siCt) did not affect the dosedependent increase of CSK protein in the isorhamnetintreated cells, whereas knockdown of the csk gene blocked
the isorhamnetin-induced increase in CSK protein (Fig. 4C).
Knockdown of csk expression reversed the inhibition of Src
activation by isorhamnetin. Transfection with control
siRNA had no effect on the isorhamnetin-dependent decrease in Src Y417 phosphorylation. Conversely, transfection

5480

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

of HT29 cells with siRNA against csk reversed the isorhamnetin-induced decrease in Y417 phosphorylation on Src. In
fact, siRNA knockdown of csk resulted in a slight increase in
Y417 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C), showing that inhibitory
effects of isorhamnetin on Src is dependent on CSK in
HT29 cells.
Transfection of HT29 cells with siCSK also reversed the
isorhamnetin inhibition of Akt and ERK activation seen in cells
transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 4C), indicating that
activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways is in part regulated
by Src or an Src family kinase in HT29 cells. Src can activate
both the ERK and the PI3K pathways (22–24). These observations show that in HT29 colorectal cancer cells isorhamnetin
induces CSK expression, leading to inactivation of Src by
phosphorylation at Y527 and decrease in ERK1/2 and AKT
activity.
Isorhamnetin inhibits Src-dependent b-catenin nuclear
translocation
The Wnt/b-catenin pathway is activated in most colorectal
cancer. b-Catenin can complex with APC and GSK3 in the
cytoplasm. Perturbation of this complex releases a stabilized
b-catenin. b-Catenin can also be tethered to the plasma
membrane by binding with a-catenin to E-cadherin (10). We

found a dose-dependent reduction in nuclear b-catenin with a
corresponding accumulation of cytoplasmic b-catenin in HT29
cells treated with isorhamnetin (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, isorhamnetin did not change GSK3 activity or E-cadherin levels
(Fig. 5C). Alternatively, isorhamnetin inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation at Y654 on b-catenin (Fig. 5A, nuclear). Tyrosine
654 is phosphorylated by Src, which results in release of
b-catenin from its complex with E-cadherin allowing nuclear
localization (10). The corresponding increase in cytoplasmic
b-catenin did not show an increase in phosphorylation at Y654,
consistent with a decrease in Src-regulated nuclear translocation of b-catenin. To assess whether nuclear translocation of
b-catenin was Src-dependent, we transfected HT29 cells with
csk siRNA. Knockdown of csk expression reversed the inhibitory effects of isorhamnetin treatment on Y654 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of b-catenin (Fig. 5B). These
results indicate that nuclear localization of b-catenin in HT29
colorectal cancer cells is a consequence of Src phosphorylation
of Y654 on b-catenin and that isorhamnetin induces expression
of CSK leads to inhibition of Src phosphorylation of Y654 on
b-catenin, blocking its release from E-cadherin and its nuclear
localization.
Isorhamnetin induces CSK expression and inhibits Src
activation in vivo
To determine if the effects of isorhamnetin on Src activation
and b-catenin nuclear localization seen in HT29 cells can be
translated to the mouse colon, we measured CSK levels, Src
activity, and b-catenin levels by IHC in AOM/DSS–treated
mice. Similar to the HT29 cells, mice consuming isorhamnetin
showed higher levels of CSK in both the DSS-treated and
untreated groups of mice compared with the mice fed the
control diet (Fig. 6A). CSK expression was higher in the lamina
propria surrounding the crypts compared with the epithelial
tissue. CSK was also detected, although at lower levels, in
normal human colon tissue. Furthermore, activated Src (phosphorylated at Y417) was higher in the crypts of AOM/DSS–
treated mice fed the control diet at both day 34 and 59 (Fig. 6B).
Conversely, inactivated Src (phosphorylated at Y529) was
higher in crypts of the isorhamnetin-fed mice (Fig. 6B). These
results indicate that isorhamnetin induces expression of CSK
and inhibits Src activation in vivo in the colons of AOM/DSS–
treated mice.
Isorhamnetin inhibits b-catenin nuclear localization
in vivo
Nuclear b-catenin levels were increased in AOM/DSS–treated mice on the control diet, consistent with activation of Src
(Fig. 6C, middle). By day 34, AOM/DSS–treated mice on the
control diet showed a diffuse staining for b-catenin throughout
the cells, indicating both cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of b-catenin. Furthermore, IHC staining with the Y654
localization of b-catenin in AOM/DSS–treated animals (middle). In
isorhamnetin-fed mice, b-catenin staining is predominantly cytoplasmic
and with limited p-b-catenin (bottom). Representative serial sections of
colonic tissue are taken from mice treated with azoxymethane only (day
31) or AOM/DSS (day 34).

phospho-speciﬁc b-catenin antibody indicated a high level of
Src-induced phosphorylation. In contrast, in the isorhamnetinfed mice, b-catenin remained predominantly in the cytoplasm
(Fig. 6C, bottom), with lower amounts of Y654 phosphorylated
b-catenin and decreased nuclear localization. These results
suggest that Src regulated phosphorylation of b-catenin and
that its nuclear translocation can be inhibited with an isorhamnetin-supplemented diet.

Discussion
In a mouse model of colorectal cancer, we evaluated the
effects of dietary isorhamnetin for colorectal cancer prevention. In this model, FVB mice treated with azoxymethane
and DSS develop tumors that will progress to adenoma and
adenocarcinomas (Table 1; refs. 15, 19). Dietary isorhamnetin reduced inﬂammation, neutrophil inﬁltration, cell proliferation, tumor burden, and mortality associated with the
AOM/DSS treatment. Src activation and b-catenin nuclear
localization induced by AOM/DSS were also reduced in the
isorhamnetin-fed mice and in HT29 colon cancer cells
treated with isorhamnetin. Isorhamnetin induced the
expression of CSK, a negative regulator of Src. In HT29 cells
isorhamnetin-induced inhibition of Src activity, and nuclear
localization of b-catenin was dependent on CSK expression
(Fig. 4). Isorhamnetin did not affect the expression of Ecadherin, activation of GSK3, or activation of S6Kinase.
These results suggest that the anti-inﬂammatory and anticancer activities of isorhamnetin are linked to inhibition of
oncogenic Src activity, which can phosphorylate b-catenin at
Y654, leading to its dissociation from the membrane and its
nuclear localization.
b-Catenin signaling in colorectal cancer
The Wnt/b-catenin pathway is activated in most colorectal
cancer (25, 26). This pathway is also activated in the AOM/DSS
mouse model (19, 27). b-Catenin can complex with a-catenin
and E-cadherin at the cytoplasmic membrane, providing
adherin junction communication (10). Activated Src can phosphorylate b-catenin at Y654, releasing it and a-catenin from
the E-cadherin complex. Dissociation of b-catenin from the
cadherin complex will cause dysregulation of tyrosine kinase
signaling, will affect cell–cell communication, will affect
b-catenin–regulated gene expression, and can lead to transformation and survival of b-catenin–driven cancer (10).
Activated c-Src in colorectal cancer is an indicator of
poor prognosis
Members of the SFK family are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases
that are recruited to the membrane by integrin or receptor
tyrosine kinase–induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion
kinase (FAK). Recruitment of SFK to the membrane provides
a molecular switch that is important for regulating proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion, and cell mobility (28).
Activated Src in primary colorectal cancer is an indicator of
poor prognosis (7), and elevated Src activity can be detected in
the majority of human colon cancer (29). Inhibition of Src or
SFK can enhance cell to cell adhesion and can suppress
migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo, suggest-

5482

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

ing an anti-invasive role for Src inhibitors (10). Inhibitors of Src
are currently being tested in clinical trials (10).
CSK negatively regulates Src
The CSK is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that serves as a
negative regulator of Src and SFK. CSK phosphorylates the
C-terminal regulatory site of SFK, resulting in a conformation change and inactivation of the kinase activity (30–33). A
reduction in CSK mRNA, protein, and kinase activity in
colorectal carcinoma has been shown to be correlated with
an increase in Src activity, suggesting that a loss in CSK
may inﬂuence transformation of colorectal carcinoma (8).
Rengifo-Cam and colleagues have shown that CSK regulates
signaling from integrin–SFK–mediated cell adhesion, which
can inﬂuence the metastasis of cancer cells (34). Recruitment to the membrane by scaffolding proteins such as CSKbinding protein (Cbp) is required for inactivation of Src
by CSK and is crucial for preventing tumorigenesis (31, 35).
The fact that none of the other ﬂavonols tested, including
mycetin, quercetin, and rutin, induced expression of csk in
HT29 cells (results not shown) and were not effective for
inhibiting carcinogenesis in vivo is consistent with our
conclusion that the chemoprotective effects of isorhamnetin
in colon cancer are linked to its anti-inﬂammatory activities
and its inhibition of oncogenic Src activity and consequential loss of nuclear b-catenin, activities that are dependent
on csk expression. Although csk expression can be regulated
translationally (36), very little is known about how csk is
regulated transcriptionally. Further investigation is needed
to learn how csk expression is lost in colorectal cancer and
how isorhamnetin restores csk expression.
Dietary isorhamnetin has chemoprotective properties
Isorhamnetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin are
ﬂavonols that are present in a wide variety of fruits and
vegetables and have anticancer activity (37). Computational
and binding assays have shown that isorhamnetin can bind
directly to MEK1 and to PI3K and quercetin can bind to
RSK2 (14, 38). Lee and colleagues (39) reported that kaempferol can bind to Src, and Jung and colleagues (40) showed
that myricetin can bind to the SFK Fyn. Our ﬁndings show
that isorhamnetin can inhibit Src activity, but that this
inhibition is dependent on CSK expression, suggesting that
unlike the structurally similar ﬂavonols, kaempferol, and
myricetin, isorhamnetin does not bind directly to Src. The
mechanism of how isorhamnetin is upregulating CSK
expression is currently under investigation. Our results and
those of others (8, 34, 35) show the importance of CSK as a
negative regulator of SFK and as a tumor suppressor, suggesting that preventing the loss of or restoring the expression of CSK would be beneﬁcial for preventing tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and tumor metastasis.
