ABSTRACT
Autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradation and recycling process, functions
in advanced malignancies to promote cancer cell survival and contribute to cancer
progression and drug resistance. While various autophagy inhibition strategies are under
investigation for cancer treatment, corresponding patient selection criteria for these
autophagy inhibitors need to be developed. Due to its central roles in the autophagy
process, the cysteine protease ATG4B is one of the autophagy proteins being pursued
as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we investigated the expression of ATG4B
in breast cancer, a heterogeneous disease comprised of several molecular subtypes. We
examined a panel of breast cancer cell lines, xenograft tumors, and breast cancer patient
specimens for the protein expression of ATG4B, and found a positive association between
HER2 and ATG4B protein expression. We showed that HER2-positive cells, but not HER2negative breast cancer cells, require ATG4B to survive under stress. In HER2-positive
cells, cytoprotective autophagy was dependent on ATG4B under both starvation and
HER2 inhibition conditions. Combined knockdown of ATG4B and HER2 by siRNA resulted
in a significant decrease in cell viability, and the combination of ATG4B knockdown with
trastuzumab resulted in a greater reduction in cell viability compared to trastuzumab
treatment alone, in both trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant HER2 overexpressing
breast cancer cells. Together these results demonstrate a novel association of ATG4B
positive expression with HER2 positive breast cancers and indicate that this subtype is
suitable for emerging ATG4B inhibition strategies.

INTRODUCTION

cell type, treatment, and context-dependent [16, 32–34].
Previous reports showed elevated ATG4B expression
in colorectal tumor cells [32] and lung cancer cells [35]
compared with adjacent normal cells. However, little is
known about ATG4B expression and function in breast
cancers, nor have the contexts been identified where
ATG4B inhibition might be beneficial.
Approximately 15%–20% of breast cancers have
amplification of the ERBB2 gene, which codes for
HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) on
chromosome 17 [36]. Patients with this subtype of breast
cancer historically had more aggressive disease and worse
outcomes compared to patients with some other breast
cancer subtypes. Since approval in 1998 of the first antiHER2 agent (trastuzumab) and development of molecularly
targeted therapies for HER2-positive breast cancer, disease
outcomes have significantly improved [36], although
drug resistance remains a challenge [37, 38]. Previous
studies [39, 40] showed that autophagy inhibition with
pharmacological inhibitors CQ or HCQ may help overcome
resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. However, the role of
ATG4B and the effects of ATG4B inhibition in HER2positive breast cancers have never been reported before.
Here we evaluated ATG4B protein expression in a
panel of HER2 negative and HER2 positive breast cancer
cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found that ATG4B expression
was elevated in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. We
further evaluated the function of ATG4B in these cells
and found that HER2-positive breast cancer cells, but
not HER2-negative breast cancer cells required ATG4B to
survive under stress. Importantly, we showed that ATG4B
inhibition sensitized HER2-positive breast cancer cells to
anti-HER2 treatment.

During the past decade, a tremendous effort has
been devoted to better understanding the dynamic role of
autophagy in different cancers, including breast cancer the most common cancer in women worldwide (reviewed
in [1–5]). However, little progress has been made in
applying this knowledge clinically for diagnostic or
therapeutic purposes. One of the outstanding challenges in
the autophagy field is determining whether certain cancer
types or subtypes are sensitive to specific autophagyrelated inhibition strategies, with the longer term aim of
better patient selection for relevant treatments.
Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy),
a lysosome-mediated degradation and recycling process,
plays an important role in maintaining cell homeostasis
and functions as an adaptive survival response to various
cellular stresses, including hypoxia and chemotherapy [1].
Depending on the stage of tumorigenesis, autophagy may
act as either a tumor suppressor [1, 6–9] or promoter [1,
10–12]. Numerous clinical trials targeting autophagy with
the non-specific pharmacological inhibitors chloroquine
(CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in various cancers
are underway, and the first published results highlight the
need for the development of reliable criteria for better
patient selection [13, 14]. In addition, whereas autophagy
inhibitors that target specific proteins crucial for distinct
steps in the autophagic process are currently under
development [15–21], our knowledge about the sensitivity
of different cancers to these inhibition strategies is limited.
The cysteine protease ATG4B is a potential target
for autophagy inhibition due to its important roles in the
autophagic pathway. ATG4B is crucial for the processing
of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B
(MAP1LC3B, or LC3B), a ubiquitin-like protein, which
is required for autophagosome formation [22]. ATG4B
is responsible for the cleavage of the carboxyl terminus
of newly synthesized pro-LC3B to provide LC3-I, a
reaction essential for further LC3B conjugation to the lipid
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) during autophagosome
formation [23–25]. LC3B-PE (or LC3B-II) is widely used
as a key autophagy marker [26]. ATG4B also delipidates
LC3B to release the protein from membranes and
recycles de-conjugated LC3B to maintain a reservoir of
its unlipidated form for new autophagosome formation
[22, 27]. Other ATG4 paralogs (ATG4A, ATG4C,
ATG4D) have also been described in mammalian cells
[28, 29]. Each of the four ATG4 family members displays
differing substrate affinities for the various mammalian
ATG8 family members (including MAP1LC3B), allowing
potential fine-tuning of the autophagic process [30, 31].
Notably, ATG4B displays the broadest substrate specificity
compared to the other ATG4 family members [29–31].
ATG4B appears to act as a positive regulator of
proliferation in some cancer types [32, 33], although the
roles of ATG4B and the effects of ATG4B inhibition are

RESULTS
ATG4B protein expression correlates with
HER2 status in breast cancer cell lines
We compared basal levels of ATG4B protein
expression in five HER2 positive and five HER2 negative
breast cancer cell lines, and found that ATG4B levels
were significantly (p<0.0001) elevated in HER2 positive
cells (Figure 1A). To further determine whether the
observed cell line differences in ATG4B levels can be
attributed to HER2 status alone, we employed genetic
approaches to specifically modify HER2 status in cells
with different genetic backgrounds. Overexpression of
HER2 in HER2-negative MCF7 and MDA-MB-231-BReGFP cells (Figure 1B) resulted in a significant increase
in ATG4B protein expression (p<0.01). Conversely,
HER2 knockdown using siRNA treatment in three HER2positive cell lines (SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, and JIMT1) led to a significant decrease in ATG4B levels (Figure
1C). Together, these findings support a positive association
between HER2 and ATG4B protein levels in breast cancer.

To determine if the expression of other autophagy
proteins correlated with HER2 status, we examined ATG5,
ATG7, BECN1/Beclin 1 and the other ATG4 family
members in the cell line panel. We observed no significant
correlations between protein expression level and HER2
status (Supplementary Figure S1); there was a trend
towards higher protein expression of Beclin 1 in HER2 positive
cells, but the difference was not statistically significant.
To determine if ATG4B mRNA levels correlated with
HER2 status, we queried mRNA data from The Cancer
Genome Atlas consortium. RNA-seq derived mRNA
levels for the ATG4 paralogs in patients with invasive
breast carcinoma (BRCA) were not found to be dynamic

between patient groups that differ in ERBB2/HER2 status,
including stratification by PAM50 subtype (n=579), by
DNA alteration status (amplifications and/or mutations
versus wild type; n=959) or by ERBB2 amplification,
mRNA overexpression (OE), and/or protein OE versus
median expression (n=410) (Supplementary Figure S1).
Similarly, there was no correlation between ATG4B
mRNA levels and ERBB2/HER2 protein levels across all
TCGA BRCA patients assessed for ERBB2/HER2 protein
abundance (n=410; Spearman r=-0.023); however, the
correlation does increase in patients with either ERBB2/
HER2 amplification, mRNA OE, and/or protein OE (n=72;
Spearman r=0.30) (Supplementary Figure S1). Together,

ATG4B as compared to HER2-negative cell lines. Representative western blot analysis shows ATG4B basal expression in a panel of HER2positive (n=5) and HER2-negative (n=5) breast cancer cell lines. Bar plots demonstrate average ATG4B expression within each group of

these results suggest that the regulation of ATG4B levels
occurs post-transcriptionally.

siRNA showed higher accumulation of LC3B-II as
compared to scramble controls, consistent with a reduction
in the recycling (de-conjugating) function of ATG4B
[22, 27]. The observed accumulation of p62 (Figure 3A)
supports an impairment of autophagy following ATG4B
knockdown. These changes in LC3B-II and p62 were
observed in both basal (i.e. fed) and starved conditions
(Figure 3A). Similar results were observed in the HER2
positive cell line SKBR3 (Supplementary Figure S2).
To confirm suppression of autophagy following
ATG4B knockdown, we used the alternative mRFPeGFP-LC3B flux assay. In control scramble-siRNA treated
SKBR3-tfLC3B cells, we found that starvation caused a
substantial increase in autophagic flux as indicated by an
increase in red puncta. However, there was no increase
in red puncta in ATG4B-siRNA treated cells (Figure
3B). Moreover, there was an increase in yellow puncta
in ATG4B-siRNA treated cells, consistent with defective
de-conjugation of LC3B from the membranes. Together,
these results show that ATG4B is required for starvationinduced autophagic flux.
To evaluate the effects of ATG4B inhibition on
cell viability, HER2 positive and HER2 negative cells
were treated with ATG4B siRNA under fed and starved
(24 hours) conditions. While ATG4B knockdown had
no significant effect on cell viability in fed conditions,
it resulted in a significant (p<0.0001) decrease in the
surviving cell fraction of HER2 positive cells under
starvation – an effect not seen in HER2 negative cells
(Figure 3C).
To determine whether ATG4B inhibition under
starvation triggers caspase-dependent cell death in HER2
positive breast cancer cells, we assessed executioner
caspase activity levels using the luminescence-based
Caspase-Glo assay. Cycloheximide (CHX) was used as
a positive control for induction of caspase activity. The
results in Figure 3D show that ATG4B knockdown under
starvation leads to increased levels of caspase activity
compared with the scramble-siRNA control in all tested
HER2 positive cell lines. These findings indicate that these
HER2-positive cells require ATG4B for survival under
starvation.

HER2 status is inversely associated with
autophagic activity
To determine how HER2-positivity affects
autophagic activity, we compared autophagic flux under
basal conditions in MCF7 and HER2+MCF7 cells
using the late-stage autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1
[26] and the results of these studies are summarized in
Figure 2A. There was an accumulation of LC3B-I and
reduction of LC3B-II in HER2+MCF7 cells in the
presence of Bafilomycin A1 as compared to parental
MCF7 cells (Figure 2A), consistent with increased LC3BII recycling by ATG4B and decreased autophagic flux.
HER2 knockdown resulted in an increase in LC3-II
levels together with a decrease in p62 levels in all tested
cell lines (Figure 1C), which suggested an increase in
autophagic flux. To monitor autophagic flux in response
to HER2 knockdown, we used mRFP-eGFP tandem
fluorescent-tagged LC3B (tfLC3B) and fluorescence
microscopy – an assay based on differential pH stability
of eGFP and mRFP fluorescent proteins [26, 41], which
allows the simultaneous evaluation of autophagy
induction and flux through autophagic compartments
without requiring the use of lysosomal inhibitors [26].
SKBR3-tfLC3B (HER2 positive) cells were treated with
HER2 siRNA, and using green/red merged images, we
quantitated yellow (i.e., RFP+GFP+, autophagosomes),
and red (i.e., RFP+GFP-, autolysosomes) puncta per cell.
As shown in Figure 2B, there was a significant increase in
both red and yellow puncta following HER2 knockdown
even under basal (i.e. fed) conditions, which confirms
an induction of autophagy and increase in autophagic
flux. Starvation, a commonly used stressor to induce
autophagic flux [42], was used as a positive control. As
seen in Figure 2B, an increase in autophagic activity in
fed HER2 knockdown cells was comparable to that in
starved control cells. Starvation in HER2-knockdown cells
resulted in further increase of autophagic flux as seen by
significantly higher red/yellow puncta ratio. An alternative
autophagic flux assay, using a saturating concentration of
lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 in the same cell line,
further confirmed the increase in autophagic flux (Figure
2C) in response to HER2 knockdown.

ATG4B is required for upregulation of
cytoprotective autophagy in response to HER2
knockdown

HER2 positive cells require ATG4B for
autophagy upregulation and survival under
stress

We observed increased autophagic flux in response
to HER2 inhibition alone, as well as dependency of HER2
positive cells on ATG4B for autophagy upregulation and
survival under stress (starvation). These findings led us to
pose the question of whether ATG4B is required for the
increased autophagy following HER2 inhibition. In order
to address this question, we performed a combination
knockdown of HER2 and ATG4B in SKBR3-tfLC3B cells.
As shown in Figure 4A, addition of ATG4B knockdown

To determine whether ATG4B knockdown results
in changes in autophagic flux in HER2 positive cells, we
performed a western blot-based autophagic flux assay,
using saturating concentrations of Bafilomycin A1 in
HER2+MCF7 cells (Figure 3A). Cells treated with ATG4B

to HER2 knockdown prevented autophagy induction that
was otherwise seen in cells treated with HER2-siRNA
alone (Figure 2B). This effect was observed in both
fed and starved conditions. Furthermore, combination
knockdown of ATG4B and HER2 resulted in the inability
of cells to upregulate autophagy in response to starvation,

as seen by a significant (p<0.05) decrease in red puncta
in combination (ATG4B and HER2) siRNA-treated cells
compared to starved controls. This result indicates that
ATG4B is required for the increase in autophagic flux in
response to HER2 knockdown alone and for starvationinduced autophagy.

autophagy levels. Western blot flux assay using saturating (60nM) concentrations of Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) shows LC3B-II and p62

To address the question of why HER2 knockdown
cells were able to induce autophagy despite having
reduced ATG4B levels (Figures 1C, 2B, and 2C), whereas
the combination (HER2 and ATG4B) knockdown
cells were unable to induce autophagy (Figure 4A),
we compared ATG4B levels by western blot analysis
(Figure 4B). While HER2-knockdown alone resulted in
a substantial reduction of ATG4B, the ATG4B levels were
still relatively high compared to the ATG4B-knockdown
alone or combination-knockdown cells (Figure 4D).
The remaining ATG4B in HER2-knockdown alone cells
was likely sufficient to enable autophagic flux, while
the additional knockdown with ATG4B siRNA brought
ATG4B to critically low levels, insufficient to promote
cytoprotective autophagy.
Another explanation for increased autophagic flux
following HER2 knockdown despite decreased ATG4B
levels may come from the possible compensatory roles of
other ATG4 family members. Western blot analysis (Figure
4C) revealed significant (similar to ATG4B) reduction in
ATG4A, ATG4C, and ATG4D levels following HER2
knockdown. To test whether the remaining levels of
ATG4A, ATG4C, and/or ATG4D function to upregulate
autophagy following HER2 knockdown, we knocked
down each of the ATG4 family members alone or in
combination with HER2 knockdown under fed and
starved conditions. Autophagic flux was assessed using the
mRFP-eGFP-LC3B flux assay in SKBR3-tfLC3B cells. As
shown in Figure 4D, ATG4C was involved in autophagy
upregulation following HER2 knockdown under both fed
and starved conditions, whereas ATG4A was only required
under starvation. There was no apparent role for ATG4D
in either condition. Together, these findings suggest
that ATG4C and ATG4A may act to compensate for the
decreased ATG4B levels and to help carry out the
increased autophagic flux following HER2 knockdown.

of 100 ug/ml of trastuzumab, for 72 hours under fed
conditions. An increase in autophagic flux in response
to trastuzumab treatment was observed in all tested cell
lines, as indicated by higher accumulation of LC3BII in cells treated with the combination of trastuzumab
and Bafilomycin A1, as compared to Bafilomycin A1
alone (Figure 5C). In addition, there was a reduction in
p62 levels in trastuzumab-treated cells, consistent with
increased autophagic flux. Moreover, similar to HER2
knockdown, trastuzumab caused a decrease in ATG4B
levels in all tested cell lines.
We assessed cell viability by pre-treating SKBR3,
MDA-MB-453, and JIMT-1 cells with ATG4B-siRNA and
48 hours later performed a second ATG4B knockdown,
followed by incubation in trastuzumab for 72 hours.
All cell lines, independent of their initial sensitivity to
trastuzumab, showed a significant (p<0.001) decrease
in cell viability following combination treatment with
ATG4B-siRNA (Figure 5D) as compared to trastuzumab
treatment with the scramble-siRNA. Results from
western blot analysis of ATG4B and LC3B levels for
this experiment (Figure 5D) were consistent with our
previous observations (i.e. reduction in ATG4B levels and
accumulation of LC3B following HER2 inhibition with
trastuzumab). Taken together, these findings indicate that
ATG4B inhibition can be an effective strategy to sensitize
HER2-positive breast cancer cells to anti-HER2 therapy.

ATG4B protein expression correlates with HER2
status in vivo
To investigate the potential clinical relevance of our
findings, we performed an exploratory analysis of breast
cancer patient specimens (Table 1, Figure 6A) and found
that ATG4B positivity was observed in a higher fraction of
HER2 positive specimens as compared to HER2 negative
samples (21% vs. 6% ATG4B positive, respectively;
p=0.0204; Table 2). ATG4B positive expression was
also significantly associated with grade 3 tumors, 10%
of which were ATG4B positive, in contrast to grade 1
and 2 tumors, of which only 4% were ATG4B positive
(p=0.0359, Table 2).
To further investigate ATG4B levels in HER2
positive tumors in vivo, we analyzed BT-474 cell line
xenograft tumors from mice treated with different
trastuzumab dose regimens: single low (4mg/kg) or high
(20mg/kg) dose, or multiple doses (10mg/kg given four
times over one week). We compared drug distribution
(Figure 6B) and ATG4B levels (Figure 6C) in tumors
following these different dosing regimens. Consistent
with our observations in vitro, there was a significant
reduction in ATG4B levels in trastuzumab-treated tumors
(single high dose and multiple-dose groups) compared to
controls. An additional HER2 positive cell line xenograft
tumor model, JIMT1, was treated with trastuzumab and
showed similar effects on ATG4B levels (Figure 6D, 6E).

ATG4B knockdown sensitizes HER2-positive
breast cancer cells to trastuzumab
Evaluation of cell viability following combination
knockdown of HER2 and ATG4B using the Alamar
Blue assay (Figure 5A) showed a significant (p<0.0001)
decrease in cell viability, which suggests that ATG4B is
required for cell survival following HER2 knockdown.
This finding was confirmed using the Trypan blue
exclusion assay (Figure 5B), an alternative cell viability
assay.
To investigate whether ATG4B inhibition
can sensitize HER2-positive cells to available antiHER2 therapy, we first tested whether treatment with
trastuzumab (Herceptin) had similar effects on autophagy
and ATG4B levels as did HER2 knockdown. We treated
trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3-tfLC3 cells with 10 ug/ml
of trastuzumab, as well as trastuzumab-resistant MDAMB-453 and JIMT-1 cells with a higher concentration

Together, these results show that ATG4B levels in HER2
positive tumors are altered by trastuzumab in a dosedependent manner in vivo.

[51] could be involved. Their data suggested that the
HER2-Beclin 1 complex is present at the cell surface of
HER2-expressing breast cancer cells and this complex
is disrupted by lapatinib treatment, which concomitantly
induces adaptive autophagy in lapatinib-resistant breast
cancer cells. Together, these findings suggest that multiple,
including mTOR-independent, mechanisms can play a
role in upregulation of autophagy in response to HER2
inhibition.
High ATG4B levels may contribute to both
conditions, low autophagic activity in non-stressed cells,
and increased autophagic flux in starved and HER2knockdown cells. It is possible that without stress, in
HER2-overexpressing cells, an excessive recycling
function of overexpressed ATG4B interferes with
proper autophagosome closure and eventually suppresses
autophagic flux [24, 52], while under stress, high levels
of ATG4B allows autophagy induction and bolsters
cell survival. Indeed, HER2-positive ATG4B-deficient
cells were unable to upregulate autophagy in response
to stress (starvation) and had significantly decreased
viability (Figure 3). Strikingly, this viability effect was
not observed in the HER2-negative cells, indicating that
ATG4B has context-dependent roles in different cancers.
A similar decrease in cell viability and proliferation under
starvation following ATG4B inhibition was observed
in osteosarcoma [16] and colorectal cancer [32] cells;
however, in the colorectal cancer model, the growth
arrest induced by silencing ATG4B was independent of
autophagic flux [32]. Here, the context-dependent role of
ATG4B was observed in different breast cancer subtypes
and linked to autophagy: HER2-positive, as opposed to
HER2-negative, breast cancer cells required ATG4B
to upregulate pro-survival autophagy in response to
starvation.
In addition, we showed for the first time that other
ATG4 family members, especially ATG4C, play a role
in autophagy upregulation following HER2 knockdown,
possibly compensating for the decrease in ATG4B
levels related to HER2 inhibition. ATG4 homologs were
previously reported to have selective preferences toward
diverse Atg8 family substrates [31], and ATG4C was
shown to be required for a proper autophagic response
under stressful conditions such as prolonged starvation
[53]. Further studies to better understand the activity of
different ATG4 family members in the setting of HER2
inhibition are required to find the most effective strategy
to target ATG4 family members in combination with
targeting HER2.
While development of small molecule inhibitors
of ATG4B is still in progress [15, 21], we used a genetic
strategy to evaluate the effects of a combination treatment
approach in three HER2 positive cell lines. Combination
knockdown of HER2 and ATG4B caused a dramatic
decrease in cell viability, as well as an inability of cells to
upregulate autophagy, confirming that ATG4B is required

DISCUSSION
Our study is the first to show ATG4B inhibition
as a strategy to sensitize HER2 positive breast cancer
cells to anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab). Moreover,
ATG4B inhibition appeared effective in all tested HER2
positive cell lines, independent of the initial sensitivity
or resistance to trastuzumab. Although trastuzumab in
combination with chemotherapy is currently considered
one of the most effective treatments in oncology, many
patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer develop
de novo or acquired resistance [37, 38]. Our results
suggest that ATG4B inhibition in combination with antiHER2 therapy can be considered a potentially effective
approach for both trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant
breast cancers.
We showed for the first time, using a panel of
HER2-negative and HER2-positive cell lines, that there is
a positive correlation between HER2 and ATG4B protein
expression. We also observed this association in a small
number of breast cancer specimens. This observation from
our exploratory IHC analysis requires further validation
in an independent patient cohort and a larger number of
specimens to confirm clinically significant associations
with breast cancer subtypes and tumor grade. In this study,
we pursued the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of this novel
association and analyzed the context-dependent roles that
ATG4B plays in breast cancer cells.
Under baseline conditions, we found that HER2overexpressing cells had low autophagic activity, but
under stress (e.g. starvation, HER2 knockdown), there was
an upregulation of autophagy. It was previously shown
that HER2 upregulates mTOR[43] – one of the major
negative regulators of autophagy [44]. In addition, Negri
et al.[45] demonstrated a significant association between
ERBB2/HER2 oncogene amplification and loss of
ATG6/BECN1 (both on 17q21) — a haploinsufficient
tumor suppressor that codes for a phylogenetically
conserved protein essential for macroautophagy[7, 46].
Tang et al. [47] also showed that low mRNA expression
of BECN1/Beclin 1 was more common in HER2-enriched
breast cancers. Together, these findings can explain low
baseline autophagy levels in HER2-overexpressing cells.
In contrast to baseline conditions, HER2 inhibition
with either HER2-siRNA or trastuzumab, similar
to starvation, induced autophagic flux. A number of
publications previously showed upregulation of autophagy
in response to anti-HER2 therapy [39, 40, 48–50].
Tang et al[48] demonstrated that autophagy induced by
lapatinib was mediated by inhibition of the class I PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway. Alternatively, a direct interaction
between Beclin 1 and HER2, described by Han et al

The study cohort included 330 female patients with primary breast cancer originally diagnosed between January 1, 1998 and
December 31, 2002, accessioned in the Pathology Department at University of British Columbia Hospital from 1997 to 2002,
and who were referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency for treatment. The median follow-up was 13 years.
LVI – lymphovascular invasion; Lum – luminal; HR – hormone receptor; TNP – triple-negative phenotype; TAM –
tamoxifen
for pro-survival autophagy in HER2-positive cells.
Importantly, we showed that nearly complete, rather than
partial, depletion of ATG4B is crucial in order to obtain
improved cytotoxicity.
Treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in
combination with ATG4B siRNA-mediated knockdown
in Herceptin-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer
cells significantly reduced cell viability compared to
trastuzumab alone in all tested cell lines. Bearing in
mind the extracellular actions of trastuzumab, including
the immunological control of neoplastic cells [54], it is
of great importance to further validate the described
effects using appropriate in vivo models. As a first
step towards future efficacy studies, we validated the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects of trastuzumab on ATG4B levels in two different
in vivo models and found a significant reduction in ATG4B
protein expression following trastuzumab treatment.
The significant reduction in cell viability following
combination inhibition of ATG4B and HER2 in vitro, as
well as the positive association between ATG4 protein
level and HER2 status in vivo, could serve as proof-ofprinciple for testing clinically relevant inhibitors of HER2
in combination with ATG4B inhibitors in the future.
In conclusion, we showed, for the first time, a
functional association between ATG4B and HER2 in
breast cancer cells. We explored the possible roles that
ATG4B plays in HER2-positive cells and found that
ATG4B is required for upregulation of pro-survival

Cell viability assays
To evaluate cell viability following ATG4B-siRNA
and HER2-siRNA treatment, we used Alamar Blue–based
66983

Oncotarget

metabolic assay (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at 2×104
cells per well in a 96-well plate and the next day transfected
with siRNA as described below. Alamar Blue was added
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations 48
hours after the second siRNA treatment, and readings
taken using an Infinite M1000 (TECAN). Data for cell
viability evaluation are presented as percentages relative to
the vehicle-only control (mean ± SEM) and graphed using
Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.).
Cell viability was also determined by the Trypan
blue exclusion assay, using a Countess Automated Cell
Counter (Life Technologies).

Cells were then mounted using SlowFade Gold Antifade
with DAPI (Invitrogen). All cells were imaged on a Leica
TCS SP8 inverted confocal microscope with a Leica HC PL
APO 63x/1.40 oil objective and LAS AF software (Leica).
The pinhole and laser brightness settings were kept constant
by applying the same properties between comparable
experiments. For each treatment, the number of red and
yellow puncta per cell were determined for at least 100
cells. Puncta counting was performed using the OpenCV
Python package; a contours discovery algorithm[58] was
applied to images pre-processed by filtering colors and
applying a Gaussian filter and adaptive threshold.

Crystal violet proliferation assay

Western blot analysis

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Images of the fixed
stained cells were captured with a Bio-rad ChemiDoc
Imaging system. Retained crystal violet stain was
resolubilized in 10% acetic acid. Readings were taken at
A590 using a plate reader (VersaMAX Microplate Reader).

Western blot analysis was performed as
described earlier [26, 41]. Briefly, protein lysates were
prepared using the RIPA Lysis Buffer Kit (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Electrophoresis and transfer of proteins were performed
using standard methods and protein–antibody complexes
were detected by chemiluminescence assays. Quantitation
of the signal was performed using Bio-Rad Image
Lab analysis software. The autophagic flux assay was
performed using saturating concentrations (20-40 nM) of
lysosomal inhibitor Bafilomycin A1.

siRNA transfection
Cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well
plate in serum-free medium and transfected with 75 pmol
ATG4B or HER2 siRNAs or a scramble medium GC
siRNA negative control (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAXTM (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s
recommendations. Serum-free medium was replaced with
fresh media containing 10% FBS the next day. Fortyeight hours after the initial siRNA transfection, cells
were transfected again with respective siRNAs following
the same protocol. Seventy-two hours after the second
transfection the cells were harvested. For the experiments
involving starvation, forty-eight hours after the second
transfection the medium in respective wells was replaced
with Earl’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS). After twentyfour hours under either starvation or fed conditions (i.e.
seventy-two hours after the second transfection) the cells
were either harvested for western blot, or fixed with
formalin for crystal violet proliferation assay.

Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega)
HER2+MCF7 cells (8 × 103) were plated in each
well of 96-well optical plates (BD Biosciences) and
transfected sequentially on day 2 and 4 with scramble
or ATG-siRNAs (5 pmol). Cycloheximide served as
a positive control. Forty-eight hours after the second
transfection, cells in respective wells were starved with
EBSS for twenty-four hours, followed by caspase activity
assessment with the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Kit. Luminescence
was measured with a Synergy H4 Hybrid (BioTek).

Study population
The study cohort included 330 female patients
with primary breast cancer originally diagnosed between
January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2002, accessioned in the
Pathology Department at University of British Columbia
(UBC) Hospital from 1997 to 2002, and who were referred
to the BC Cancer Agency for treatment. Cases with microinvasive primary tumors whose tissue blocks did not contain
sufficient material for tissue microarray construction were
excluded. Patients with a previously diagnosed breast
cancer, or synchronous breast cancer (additional diagnosis
of breast cancer within 6 months of diagnosis of the
primary) were excluded. The median follow-up was 13
years. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from
the Clinical Research Ethics Board of the British Columbia
Cancer Agency, and Simon Fraser University.
Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.

SKBR3-mRFP-eGFP-LC3B (SKBR3-tfLC3)
assay
SKBR3 cells (ATCC) stably transfected with mRFPeGFP-LC3B [57] were plated at a density 1,600 cells per
well in 200uL of DMEM with G418 in 8-well chamber
slides. Twenty-four and seventy-two hours later cells were
transfected with ATG4B-siRNA, ATG4A-siRNA, ATG4CsiRNA, ATG4D-siRNA, HER2-siRNA, or medium GCsiRNA constructs. Media was replenished every day after
initial plating and before siRNA treatment. Complete
starvation was performed by incubation in PBS for two
hours at 37°C. At the end of the experiment the cells were
fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes and then rinsed with PBS.

or wild type; n=959) or PAM50 subtype (n=579) for
patients where status was available in cbioportal.
org. Gene abundance was also stratified by ERBB2/
HER2 status, where we defined HER2 positive patients
(HER2+) as patients for which ERBB2 protein levels
had been assessed by RPPA platform (n=410), who were
found to meet the following parameters: 1) ERBB2
protein overexpression (Z-score > 2.0), 2) ERBB2
mRNA overexpression (Z-score > 2.0), or 3) ERBB2
amplification. Many patients showed a combination
of these conditions: ERBB2 amplification/mRNA
overexpression (OE)/protein OE (n=25), ERBB2
amplification/mRNA OE (n=27), amplification only
(n=7), mRNA OE only (n=12), mRNA OE/protein OE
(n=1). To examine ATG4B and ERBB2 co-expression,
we plotted ATG4B mRNA levels (Level 3 normalized
RSEM Z-scores) versus ERBB2 protein levels (Level 3
normalized RPPA Z-scores) and calculated the Spearman
correlation for HER+ patients and HER2- patients.

Slides from formalin fixed paraffin embedded
archival blocks from the 330 patients were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). These slides were
reviewed by a pathologist to identify areas of invasive
breast carcinoma. Two 0.6 mm cores from each block
were extracted and embedded into three tissue microarray
blocks. Slices from this tissue microarray were stained
previously with H&E, ER, PR, HER2, Ki67, CK5/6 and
EGFR using procedures as described [59, 60]. Intrinsic
subtypes based on immunohistochemical marker panel
were assigned using the definitions previously described
[59, 60]. ATG4B immunohistochemistry was performed
using the Ventana Discovery Ultra automated instrument
(Ventana Medical Systems Inc, Tuscon, USA) according
to manufacturer’s recommendations.
All clinical and pathological data for each tumor
sample was blinded to the pathologist during scoring.
Each sample was assessed for the presence (i.e. positivity)
of diffuse ATG4B under X50 magnification.

In vivo studies
Mice bearing BT-474 and JIMT1 xenograft
tumors received intraperitoneal injections of unlabeled
trastuzumab at 4, 10 or 20 mg/kg and tumors collected at
4-24h after the last administration. An intravenous injection
of 0.6mg/ml DioC7(3), a fluorescent carbocyanine dye
labeling patent vessels, was administered 5 minutes prior
to tissue collection and cryopreservation. Cryosections (10
µm) were imaged directly for native DioC7(3) fluorescence
and then stained for bound trastuzumab using fluorescently
tagged antihuman secondary antibodies and re-imaged, as
previously described [64]. ATG4B and actin protein levels
were assessed by western blot analysis; protein extraction
procedure has been previously described in [41].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R-3.2.1.
Clinicopathological parameter and biomarker associations
were assessed using contingency tables. The significance of
associations was determined using Fisher’s exact test for
parameters that are nominal such as intrinsic subtype.
The significance of correlations was determined using
Kendall’s tau test for parameters that are ordinal such as
tumor grade.
The cut point (negative vs. any positive) for ATG4B
was chosen to maximize statistical power. Distribution
of the scores was assessed using frequency tables and
histograms. The cut point that resulted in the minimal
difference between the number of positive and negative
cases was chosen.
All immunohistochemistry tissue microarray images
and scores used in this study are publicly available at the
companion site http://www.gpecimage.ubc.ca (username:

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Patient status for ERBB2 DNA alteration (copy
number alteration or mutation), mRNA overexpression
(Z-score > 2.0), and protein overexpression (Z-score >
2.0) were obtained from cbioportal.org [61, 62] for The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) invasive breast cancer
data set (BRCA) [63]. Quantile normalized Level 3
mRNA levels (illuminahiseq_rnaseqv2-RSEM_genes_
normalized) and Level 3 protein levels (mda_rppa_
core-protein_normalization) were downloaded from
firebrowse.org for these same TCGA BRCA patients.
Gene abundance for genes of interest were stratified
