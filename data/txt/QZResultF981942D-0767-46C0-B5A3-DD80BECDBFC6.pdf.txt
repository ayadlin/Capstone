Prostate cancer (CaP) progresses from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia through locally invasive
adenocarcinoma to castration resistant (CR) metastatic carcinoma1. Although radical prostatectomy,
radiation and androgen ablation are effective therapies for androgen-dependent (AD) CaP, metastatic
CR-CaP is a major complication with high mortality2. Androgens stimulate growth and survival of
prostate epithelium and early CaP. Although most patients initially respond to androgen ablation,
many develop CR-CaP within 12-18 months2. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying
CR-CaP emergence remain poorly understood and their elucidation is critical for development of
improved therapies. Curiously, CR-CaP remains androgen receptor (AR) dependent and potent AR
antagonists induce tumor regression in castrated mice3. The role of inflammation in CR-CaP has not
been addressed, although it was reported that intrinsic NF-κB activation supports its growth4.
Inflammation is a localized protective reaction to injury or infection, but it also has a pathogenic role
in many diseases, including cancer5. Whereas acute inflammation is critical for host defense, chronic
inflammation contributes to tumorigenesis and metastatic progression. The inflammation-responsive
IκB kinase (IKK) β and its target NF-κB have important tumor promoting functions within malignant
cells and inflammatory cells6. The latter, including macrophages and lymphocytes, are important
elements of the tumor microenvironment7-9, but the mechanisms underlying their recruitment remain
obscure, although thought to depend on chemokine and cytokine production10. We found that CaP
progression is associated with inflammatory infiltration and activation of IKKα, which stimulates
metastasis by an NF-κB-independent, cell autonomous, mechanism11. We now show that androgen
ablation causes infiltration of regressing AD tumors with leukocytes, including B cells, in which
IKKβ activation results in production of cytokines that activate IKKα and STAT3 in CaP cells to
enhance hormone-free survival.
To determine whether IKKβ-driven NF-κB participates in development of CR-CaP, we
conditionally deleted the Ikkβ gene in prostate epithelial cells of TRAMP mice, in which CaP
is induced by prostate specific expression of SV40 T antigen12. Counter to previous
expectations4, IKKβ ablation in prostate epithelial cells had no effect on genesis and
progression of AD-CaP (Fig. S1) or development of CR-CaP after castration (Fig. S2). To
facilitate mechanistic analysis of CR-CaP development we used subcutaneous (SC) allografts
of the mouse AD-CaP cell line myc-CaP, which is derived from the FVB genetic

background13. Silencing of IKKβ in myc-CaP cells did not affect primary tumor growth or
CR-CaP re-growth in castrated FVB mice (Fig. S3).

By contrast, deletion of IKKβ in interferon-responsive cells upon induction of Mx1-Cre
expression prevented castration-induced metastatic spread in TRAMP/IkkβF/F/Mx1-Cre mice
(Fig. S4A). To narrow down the role of IKKβ to bone marrow (BM)-derived cells (BMDCs),
we reconstituted irradiated FVB mice with BM from IkkβF/F and IkkβΔ/Δ mice [IkkβF/F/Mx1Cre mice injected with poly(IC) to induce Mx1-Cre] and inoculated the resulting chimeras
(Fig. S4B) with myc-CaP cells. Absence of IKKβ in BMDC had no impact on primary tumor
growth, but delayed CR-CaP emergence after castration (Fig. S4C). A similar delay in CRCaP growth was seen in castrated tumor-bearing mice treated with specific IKKβ
inhibitors14, 15 (Fig. S4D and data not shown).

Dependence of CR-CaP emergence on IKKβ in BMDC, suggested that androgen deprivation
elicits a tumor-associated inflammatory response. Castration of mice bearing myc-CaP tumors
resulted in CaP cell death, peaking within one week (Fig. 1A). Concurrently, the regressing
tumors were infiltrated with T and B lymphocytes, NK cells and myeloid cell types (Fig. 1B;
Fig. S5). Infiltration was transient, declining by 2 weeks after castration. B and T lymphocyte
infiltration was also detected in 100% of human CaP samples (untreated patients with Gleason
scores of 6-8), but B cells were undetectable in normal prostate or benign prostatic hyperplasia
(Fig. 1C). The mRNAs for many inflammatory chemokines were also upregulated in the mycCaP allografts, but no changes in AR mRNA expression were found (Fig. S6A). These
chemokines may recruit lymphoid and myeloid cells into the regressing tumor. Indeed,
antibody mediated inhibition of CXCL13, a B cell chemoattractant16, prevented castrationinduced B cell recruitment (Fig. S6B,C). Inflammatory cytokine mRNAs, including IL-6,
IL-12, TNF-α and lymphotoxin (LT), were also upregulated in the regressing myc-CaP
allograft, but only LT expression was reduced upon CXCL13 inhibition (Fig. S7). Castration
resulted in nuclear export of AR, but after 3 weeks AR was nuclear again (Fig. S8), suggesting
it is activated at late phases of CR-CaP growth despite androgen depletion.
STAT3 was proposed to promote activation of unliganded AR17. Indeed, STAT3 was activated
during CR-CaP emergence, faster than AR was (Fig. S9). Mx1-Cre-mediated IKKβ deletion,
which was nearly complete in mature B and T lymphocytes (Fig. S10A), prevented STAT3
activation in regressing tumors, but did not affect ERK and AKT activation (Fig. S10B).
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed STAT3 activation in CaP cells, inhibitable by A490
(Fig. S10C), an inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation18 that delayed appearance of CR-CaP
(Fig. S10D) but did not inhibit IKK activation (Fig. S11A). Conversely, ML120B did not
inhibit STAT3 activation (Fig. S11B).

Ablation of BMDC IKKβ did not prevent leukocyte recruitment into regressing tumors (Fig.
S12) but did inhibit cytokine induction (Fig. S13). To further investigate the role of
lymphocytes, we used chimeric mice generated by transplantation of BM from lymphocytedeficient Rag1−/− mice. Although primary tumor growth was identical in mice receiving WT
or Rag1−/− BM (Fig. S14A), CR-CaP growth was significantly delayed in mice receiving
Rag1−/− BM (Fig. 2A), but not in mice reconstituted with BM from Tcrβ−/−/δ−/− mice (Fig.
S14B), which lack only mature T lymphocytes. CR-CaP growth was delayed in mice
reconstituted with BM from JH−/− mice (Fig. S14C), which lack mature B cells, or upon B cell
depletion with CD20 antibody19 (Fig. S14D). Reconstitution of Rag1−/− FVB mice with splenic
B cells, but not T cells of FVB mice, restored rapid CR-CaP re-growth (Fig. 2A). Primary
tumors, isolated from Rag1−/− chimeric mice one week after castration, did not show STAT3
activation (Fig. 2B), but reconstitution with B cells, rather than T cells, restored castrationinduced STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C).

CaP allografts from castrated, but not sham-operated, mice exhibited IKKα nuclear
translocation (Fig. 3A,B). Silencing of IKKα in myc-CaP cells using siRNA (Fig. S15A) had
little effect on primary tumor growth, but delayed CR-CaP emergence (Fig. 3C). Nuclear
translocation of IKKα was dependent on IKKβ in BMDC and on B cells, but not on T cells
(Fig. 3D). IKKα nuclear translocation parallels progression of human and murine CaP and
coincides with primary tumor infiltration with cells expressing IKKα-activating cytokines,
RANK ligand (RANKL) and LTα11. Castration induced LTα and LTβ in regressing myc-CaP
allografts, but did not alter RANKL expression (Fig. S7). LT expression in regressing tumors
was absent in Rag1−/− mice (Fig. S16A) and flow cytometry localized it to tumor infiltrating
B cells (TIBC; Fig. S16B). We characterized TIBC by 7-color flow cytometry with several
markers and a LTβR-Ig fusion protein to detect LT. The typical TIBC was a conventional,
mature B2 cell that expressed LT on its surface and was negative for B1 markers (Fig. S17).
IKKβ deletion abolished LT expression by B cells (Fig. 4A), supporting the previously
suggested20 role of NF-κB in LTα/β induction. To examine whether LT production by tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes stimulates CR-CaP growth, we transplanted BM from B-Ltβ−/− or TLtβ−/− mice, which lack LTβ in either B or T cells21, into lethally irradiated mice. LTβ ablation
in B cells, but not in T cells, delayed growth of CR-CaP (Fig. 4B) and abolished LTβ expression
within tumors but did not prevent B cell or macrophage infiltration (Fig. S18). Treatment of
mice with the LTβR-Ig decoy22 was as effective as B cell-specific LTβ ablation in delaying
CR-CaP growth (Fig. 4C) and prevented IKKα and STAT3 activation (Fig. S19). Silencing of
LTβR in Myc-CaP cells (Fig. S15B) also delayed CR-CaP growth (Fig. 4D). Exogenous LT
maintained myc-CaP growth in the presence of flutamide, a clinically used AR antagonist3, in
a manner dependent on IKKα (Fig. 4E), whose nuclear translocation was LT inducible (Fig.
4F).

CR-CaP is a major complication that limits the success of androgen ablation therapy and is
responsible for most prostate cancer mortality2. CR-CaP was studied mainly at the level of AR
function, the central player in this process4. Our results suggest that an inflammatory response
triggered by death of androgen-deprived primary cancer is another important contributor to
emergence of CR-CaP. In addition to dying CaP cells, critical participants in this response are
tumor infiltrating B cells, which produce LTα:β heterotrimers that stimulate LTβR on CaP
cells to induce IKKα nuclear translocation and STAT3 activation, thereby enhancing androgenindependent growth (Fig. S20). Interference with any component of this response results in a
significant and reproducible 3-4 week delay in appearance of CR-CaP. Although these
inhibitory effects are not absolute, extrapolation from “mouse time” to “human time” suggests
that interventions that prevent LT production or signaling may delay appearance of CR-CaP
in patients undergoing androgen ablation therapy by 2.3 to 3.1 years. Importantly, our results
suggest that, at least for CaP, the inflammatory response elicited by the dying primary tumor,
contributes to the failure rather than the previously proposed success of anti-cancer
therapy23. Although we have not determined how death of androgen-deprived CaP triggers the
inflammatory response described above, necrotic cell death releases mediators, such as
HMGB124 and IL-1α25, that activate IKKβ and NF-κB and stimulate production of
chemokines, one of which, CXCL13, recruits B cells into the regressing tumor. Notably, TIBC
were detected not only in androgen-deprived mouse CaP, but also in human CaP. Although B
cells were reported to promote progression of skin carcinomas9 and exert immunosuppressive
effects through activation of inhibitory Fc receptors on myeloid cells26, the critical tumor
promoting B cell function in our experimental model is production of LT, an IKKα-activating
cytokine27, which promotes survival of androgen-deprived CaP. Another important function
of TIBC is activation of STAT3, an anti-apoptotic and pro-tumorigenic transcription
factor28. Although the critical STAT3-activating cytokine in this system remains to be
identified, castration induces expression of STAT3-activating IL-6 and IL-12 family members.
Furthermore, CaP cells use autocrine IL-6 to stimulate their progression29 and activated STAT3
promotes ligand-independent AR activation29. LT is also involved in the etiology of human

CaP. An epidemiological study revealed that reduced CaP risk due to consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, is limited to men who express a common
polymorphic LTα allele that specifies high LT production30. Further work should examine the
effect of LTα polymorphism on the response to androgen ablation. Our results predict that
individuals who are high LT producers are more likely to develop CR-CaP and should therefore
be the main beneficiaries of anti-LT therapy.

Methods Summary
A detailed Methods section is available in Supplementary Information. Mice were handled
according to institutional and NIH guidelines. Tumors were grown in FVB mice. Where
indicated, lethally irradiated FVB mice were reconstituted with BM from different strains that
were backcrossed into the FVB background for at least two generations. Ltβ knockout strains
were, however, in the BL6 background which does not elicit a graft vs. host response in FVB
mice. Conditions for antibody used were posted to http://biorating.com. Human material was
obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) along with pathology reports.
Histology, gene expression and cell signaling were analyzed as described11, 25.

Figure 1. Androgen ablation induces tumor inflammatory infiltration

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Six week old FVB males (n=10) were inoculated with myc-CaP cells. When tumors reached
1000 mm3, mice were left untreated, castrated or sham operated. Tumors were collected when
indicated for analysis. A. Paraffin-embedded tumor sections were TUNEL stained to determine
apoptotic cell frequency (results are averages, n=3). B. Total RNA was isolated from tumor
samples and expression of indicated cell marker mRNAs was quantitated and normalized to
that of cyclophilin A (norm= normal, C1,2,3= mice analyzed 1,2,3 weeks after castration,
sham= sham-operated). Results are averages ± s.d. (n=10). C. Frozen human prostate sections
(normal tissue [n=3], prostatic hyperplasia [n=3], and malignant CaP with Gleason scores 6-8
[n=10]) were stained with CD4, CD8 and CD20 antibodies and DAPI and analyzed by
immunofluorescent microscopy. The histogram denotes average frequencies of indicated cell
types (n=3 per sample). P values were determined and are depicted as insignificant (ns),
significant (*), very significant (**) or highly significant (***).

A. Myc-CaP tumors were established in WT mice reconstituted with BM from Rag1−/− males
(n=10) or in Rag1−/− males. When tumors reached 1000 mm3, mice were castrated. Three days
before castration, Rag1−/− mice (n=10 per group) received via the tail vein purified splenic B
or T cells. Tumor volume was measured. Results are averages ± s.e.m.. P values were
determined and are indicated as above. B. Tumors were removed from radiation chimeras
reconstituted with IkkβF/F, IkkβΔ/Δ, or Rag1−/− BM, one week after castration. STAT3
phosphorylation was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. C. Tumor-bearing Rag1−/− males
were injected with WT splenocytes (Rag1 + WT), or purified splenic B (Rag1 + B) or T
(Rag1 + T) lymphocytes. One day later, mice were castrated and after one week, tumors were
removed and analyzed for STAT3 phosphorylation.

Figure 3. Role of IKKα in emergence of CR-CaP

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor-bearing mice were castrated or sham operated as above. A. Tumors were analyzed one
week later for nuclear IKKα by immunohistochemistry. B. Tumors removed at indicated times
were divided into cytosolic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions and IKKα and histone H3 distribution
was determined. C. Tumors were established using myc-CaP cells transduced with lentiviruses
expressing scrambled siRNA (sc) or IKKα-specific siRNA. Mice were castrated as above and
tumor volume was measured. Results are averages ± s.e.m. (n=10). P values were determined
and are indicated as above. D. Tumors were established in lethally irradiated FVB males
reconstituted with IkkβF/F or IkkβΔ/Δ BM or in Rag1−/− males reconstituted with either B or T
cells. IkkβF/F and IkkβΔ/Δ chimeras were i.p. injected three times with poly(IC) (250 μg) prior
to castration to delete IKKβ. One week after castration, tumor samples were analyzed for
IKKα distribution by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear IKKα results in punctuate staining,
while cytoplasmic IKKα results in diffuse staining.

A. RNA from splenic B cells of IkkβF/F and IkkβΔ/Δ mice was analyzed for LTα and LTβ
expression as above. Results are averages ± s.d. (n=3). B. Lethally irradiated FVB males were
reconstituted with BM from B-Ltβ−/− or T-Ltβ−/− mice (n=6 per group). After 8 weeks, mycCaP tumors were established, mice were castrated and tumor volume was measured as above.
Results are averages ± s.e.m.. C. FVB mice (n=6 each group) bearing myc-CaP tumors were
castrated and given hIgG or LTβR-Ig (100 μg) every 5 days, starting 4 days before castration.
Tumor volume was measured as above. Results are averages ± s.e.m.. D. Tumors were
established using myc-CaP cells transduced with lentiviruses expressing scrambled (sc) siRNA
or LTβ-specific siRNA. Mice were castrated and tumor volume was measured. Results are
averages ± s.e.m. (n=10). E. Myc-CaP cells (previously infected with lentiviruses expressing
scrambled or IKKα siRNAs) were plated at 40% confluency. After 6 hrs, the cells were cultured
with or without flutamide (10 μM) in the absence or presence of LTα2β1, and cell number was
determined. F. Myc-CaP cells were plated at 60% confluency. After 12 hrs, cells were
stimulated for 1 hr with LTα2β1, collected, divided into cytosolic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions
and IKKα and histone H3 distribution was determined. In A, B, C, D and E, P values were
determined and are indicated as above.
