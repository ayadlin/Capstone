BACKGROUND: Many women with early-stage breast cancer are working at the time of diagnosis and survive without disease recurrence. The short-term impact of chemotherapy receipt on employment has been demonstrated, but the long-term impact merits further research. METHODS: The authors conducted a longitudinal multicenter cohort study of women diagnosed with nonmetastatic
breast cancer between 2005 and 2007, as reported to the population-based Los Angeles and Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results program registries. Of 3133 individuals who were sent surveys, 2290 (73%) completed a baseline survey soon after diagnosis and of these, 1536 (67%) completed a 4-year follow-up questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 1026 patients aged < 65 years at the
time of diagnosis whose breast cancer did not recur and who responded to both surveys, 746 (76%) worked for pay before diagnosis.
Of these, 236 (30%) were no longer working at the time of the follow-up survey. Women who received chemotherapy as part of their
initial treatment were less likely to be working at the time of the follow-up survey (38% vs 27%; P 5.003). Chemotherapy receipt at
the time of diagnosis (odds ratio, 1.4; P 5.04) was found to be independently associated with unemployment during survivorship in a
multivariable model. Many women who were not employed during the survivorship period wanted to work: 50% reported that it was
important for them to work and 31% were actively seeking work. CONCLUSIONS: Unemployment among survivors of breast cancer 4
years after diagnosis is often undesired and appears to be related to the receipt of chemotherapy during initial treatment. These findings should be considered when patients decide whether to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly when the expected benefit

INTRODUCTION
Greater than 225,000 women are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the United States each year,1 the majority of
whom are of working age and survive through the typical age for retirement. Some work loss during the treatment period is
common as patients balance an arduous treatment schedule and acute side effects with work and family life. However, less is
known regarding the long-term impact of cancer treatments on paid employment. Because work may be intrinsically rewarding and is also an important source of income, insurance, and social interactions, loss of work may profoundly affect quality
of life in addition to causing economic losses for society, particularly when it extends beyond the treatment period. Therefore, understanding the long-term effects of treatment on employment status is a critical focus of survivorship research.2
Previous studies have primarily evaluated the employment trajectory of patients with breast cancer during treatment
and soon thereafter. In a population-based study of US patients 9 months after a diagnosis of breast cancer, we previously
reported that 24% had missed > 1 month of work and 32% had stopped working altogether due to breast cancer or its
treatment.3 Similarly, a Dutch study found that only 70% of workers with breast cancer had even partially returned to

Loss of paid employment after a diagnosis of breast cancer is common, often undesired, not restricted to the treatment period, and potentially related to the
type of treatment administered. These findings should be considered when patients decide whether to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly when the
expected benefit is low.

work 1 year after their breast cancer diagnosis.4 Other
studies have suggested that women do eventually return to
work. In a longitudinal US study conducted from 2001
through 2002, only 17% of previously employed breast
cancer survivors were not working at 18 months.5,6 In a
population-based study of Swedish patients with breast
cancer, only 11% of those who worked before diagnosis
were not working 16 months later.7 Thus, existing data
suggest substantial effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment on employment during the first year after diagnosis
but a possible waning of impact by the second year.
Less is known concerning the long-term employment outcomes of survivors of breast cancer, and specifically whether certain subgroups of patients with cancer
are particularly vulnerable to loss of desired employment
during the long-term survivorship period.8 Previous
research has suggested that long-term survivors of breast
cancer are, in general, less likely to be employed than their
counterparts without breast cancer.9,10 Cancer survivors
may experience a change in their desire for work, prioritizing volunteerism, family, or leisure more after facing a
life-threatening illness.11 Survivors might also face discrimination from employers.12-14 Long-term morbidity
related to either treatment or disease recurrence may
reduce survivors’ ability to work.15-19 Moreover, treatments may have led to periods of missed work that may
have lasting consequences on survivors’ subsequent ability
to maintain long-term employment.
The potential impact of chemotherapy on long-term
employment outcomes in particular requires further
investigation. We previously found that patients who
received chemotherapy were more likely to stop working
in the short term,3 and in a sample of low-income survivors of breast cancer, others have found that very poor
women who stop working during chemotherapy are at
risk of not returning to work in the longer term.20 Yet
others have found no effect of chemotherapy on return to
work.6,21 Moreover, relatively little is known regarding
whether those who fail to return to work are actively seeking work.
Experts in the field have identified desirable methodologic criteria for studies of work after cancer,22 including population-based sampling, longitudinal design,
detailed measures, and adequate sample size. We developed a study that fulfilled these criteria and conducted a
longitudinal study inquiring about work outcomes in the
population-based sample of patients with breast cancer we
had previously surveyed near the time of diagnosis,3 seeking specifically to investigate whether chemotherapy
receipt as part of the initial treatment was associated with

the employment outcomes among long-term survivors of
breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Sample

We conducted a longitudinal, multicenter cohort study of
women diagnosed with breast cancer in metropolitan Los
Angeles and Detroit. A major prespecified objective of the
current study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in
disruption of paid work for patients with breast cancer
into the survivorship period. Patients aged 20 years to 79
years and diagnosed with American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) stage 0 to III breast cancer between June
2005 and February 2007, as reported to the National
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) population-based program registries in
those regions, were eligible for sample selection. Using a
population-based registry allows for a study sample that is
generally representative of the population of incident cancer cases in the respective geographic area in terms of sex,
race or ethnicity, age, and other demographic characteristics. We used the rapid case ascertainment method, which
allows the SEER registries to identify patients within 1
month of their diagnosis.23
Patients were excluded if they had stage IV breast
cancer or could not complete a questionnaire in English
or Spanish. Asian women in Los Angeles were excluded
because of enrollment in other studies (the Los Angeles
SEER protocol limits patient enrollment into multiple
concurrent studies). Latina (in Los Angeles) and black (in
both Los Angeles and Detroit) patients were oversampled
to ensure sufficient minority representation.
Questionnaire Design and Content

We developed original questionnaires after considering
the existing literature, measures previously developed to
assess relevant constructs,3,24 and theoretical models.
Measures in the survey were pretested to maximize reliability and validity and were based on a priori hypotheses
generated from preliminary studies, which suggested gaps
in return to paid work after treatment of breast cancer.
Survey content included extensive batteries of questions
addressing paid work, financial issues, and other qualityof-life factors. Additional content in the 38-page initial
survey questionnaire and 42-page follow-up survey questionnaire addressed other treatment and care issues relevant during the survivorship period (see online
supporting information). To avoid response bias, survey
recipients received survey questionnaires simply entitled

Breast Cancer” (see online supporting information).
Data Collection

After Institutional Review Board approval, eligible
patients were identified and informed of all aspects and
the intent of the study in the survey materials. The Institutional Review Board approved a waiver of a written signature of informed consent, with the return of a completed
survey taken to indicate informed consent. After notifying
physicians, we first recruited and surveyed patients at a
mean of 9 months after diagnosis (mean time from diagnosis to survey response, 284 days; standard deviation, 96
days). We then contacted all respondents approximately 4
years later (mean time from diagnosis to survey response,
1524 days; standard deviation, 143 days). To encourage
responses, we provided a $10 cash incentive along with
the paper survey mailing and used a modified Dillman
method,25 including reminders to nonrespondents. All
materials were sent in English and in Spanish to those
with Spanish surnames.26 Responses to the baseline and
follow-up surveys were combined into a single data set,
into which clinical data from SEER were merged. The
evolution of the sample is detailed in Figure 1.
Measures

Our primary dependent variable for analysis was defined
by selecting those women who reported working (regardless of whether they were employed full time or part time)
before diagnosis (as reported in the baseline questionnaire) and then determining which of these reported in
1856

the follow-up survey that they were not working at that
time.
We considered several independent variables. Clinical factors included SEER-reported clinical stage of disease (AJCC stage 0, I, II, or III) and patient-reported
comorbidity and treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
and surgery) as measured in the baseline survey. Sociodemographic factors were determined in the baseline questionnaire, including age, race/ethnicity, educational
status, family income, marital status, work hours at the
time of diagnosis (full time vs less than full time), and
employment support (having a job with sick leave and/or
a flexible schedule). Geographic site (Los Angeles vs
Detroit) was also included in the analyses.
We measured in the follow-up survey patients’ perceptions of whether, since the time of diagnosis, they were
worse off with regard to health insurance, employment
status, and financial status. We also evaluated, among
those women not working at the time of the follow-up
survey, how important it was for them to work and
whether they were actively seeking employment.
Statistical Analysis

To allow statistical inferences to be more representative of
the original targeted population, we applied survey
weights and implemented a multiple imputation method
to the calculation of percentages and regression analyses.27
All percentages reported below are so weighted and
reported alongside unweighted numbers. Design weights
compensated for the disproportionate selection across
race and SEER sites; survey unit nonresponse weights
compensated for the fact that women with certain characteristics were not as likely to respond to the surveys
(patients who did not respond to both surveys were more
likely to be African American [35.2% vs 26.7%;
P < .001], to be Latina [17.2% vs 13.3%; P 5 .002], to
have stage II-III disease [54.9% vs 37.8%; P < .001], and
to have undergone a mastectomy [37.5% vs 30.8%;
P < .001]). Among patients who responded to both surveys, missing data due to survey item nonresponse constituted 10% of the analytic sample when all covariates in
the final model were considered simultaneously. To
address missing data from nonresponse to an item, we first
multiply imputed the data 5 times followed by combining
the results from statistical analyses on these 5 imputed
data sets using the Rubin’s formula.28,29 We limited our
analytic sample to patients aged <65 years at diagnosis,
whose breast cancer did not recur before the follow-up
survey, who responded to both surveys, and who reported
working for pay before their diagnosis in the baseline

survey. We examined patterns and correlates of paid work
at the time of the follow-up survey using chi-square tests
for univariate analyses and logistic regression analysis for
multivariable analyses, which included the following theoretically selected independent variables: age, number of
comorbidities, race, education, family income, work
hours at the time of diagnosis, employment support, marital status, AJCC stage of disease, chemotherapy receipt,
surgery type, radiation receipt, and geographic site. In the
logistic regression analysis, we tested for interactions
between chemotherapy use and other covariates in the
model as well as between family income and geographic
site. These interactions were not found to be significantly
associated with work loss and we subsequently eliminated
them from the final model. Collinearity of the covariates
was assessed using variance inflation factors.30 All analyses
were conducted using SAS statistical software (version
9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of the 1026 patients aged < 65 years at the time of diagnosis whose breast cancer did not recur and who
responded to both surveys, 746 (76%) reported working
for pay before diagnosis in the baseline survey. Of these,
236 patients (30%) were no longer working at the time of
the follow-up survey.
Table 1 describes the clinical and sociodemographic
characteristics of the sample, and Table 2 presents the
bivariate correlates of employment at the time of the
follow-up survey. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, 61% of
respondents had received chemotherapy. Women who
received chemotherapy as part of their initial cancer treatment were more likely to report that they were not working at the time of the follow-up survey (38% vs 27%;
P 5 .003). There was no statistically significant difference
noted by chemotherapy receipt in the percentage of
respondents who considered themselves to be retired at
the time of the follow-up survey (13% of patients receiving chemotherapy and 14% of those not receiving chemotherapy; P 5 .48).
Figure 2 depicts the pattern of employment among
women who were employed at the time of their breast
cancer diagnosis. Women who were employed at the time
of diagnosis were substantially less likely to be employed
after their initial treatment if they had received chemotherapy. Long-term survivors were also less likely to be
employed 4 years after diagnosis if they had received
chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment.
The excess unemployment observed for women who
received chemotherapy began soon after diagnosis. ComCancer

therapy at the time of diagnosis were significantly more
likely to report unemployment at 4 years (odds ratio
[OR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.031.98). Other significant correlates of 4-year unemployment were older age (OR, 1.42 for age  56 years compared with age <46 years; 95% CI, 1.03-1.95), greater
number of comorbidities (OR, 2.16 for  2 comorbidities
vs none; 95% CI, 1.59-2.94), and lack of employment
support (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.08-1.67).
Many women who were not employed in the survivorship period wanted to work. Of the 127 women who
had not worked since diagnosis, 63 (55%) reported that it
was important for them to work and 39 (39%) were
actively looking for work. These figures were similar for
patients who did and did not receive chemotherapy during the initial treatment period: 31% versus 32% were
actively looking for work (P 5 .96) and 50% versus 49%
reported that work remained important to them
(P 5 .76). Moreover, those who were no longer working
were significantly more likely to report that they were
worse off with regard to their insurance status and financial status, as depicted in Figure 3 (P < .001 for each).

had paid employment at time of diagnosis. We found that
nearly one-third of those employed before diagnosis were
no longer working 4 years later, and many of these women
continued to desire employment. Patients who had
received chemotherapy as part of their initial course of
therapy were less likely to be working 4 years after diagnosis than patients who did not receive chemotherapy, after
controlling for other factors.
To our knowledge, published studies of cancer and
employment outcomes to date have provided limited inCancer

formation regarding the long-term impact of diagnosis
and treatment on survivors of breast cancer. In analyses of
the Health and Retirement Study10,11 and the National
Health Interview Survey,31 cancer survivors were found to
be less likely to work than controls without cancer. However, absent information concerning key clinical characteristics such as cancer stage and treatment, the
mechanisms by which a cancer diagnosis affects long-term
employment have remained uncertain.
Understanding which subgroups of cancer patients
are most vulnerable to long-term work loss is critical for
clinicians and policymakers seeking to develop appropriate interventions.32 In particular, the impact of treatments
and social supports are important considerations because
these are potentially modifiable. Previous studies have
suggested an important influence of employment support3,6,7,33 or chemotherapy receipt21,34,35 on the shortterm employment outcomes of survivors of breast cancer,
including missed work, work hours, and short-term job
loss. The results of the current study suggest that both of
these factors may also have a long-lasting negative impact
on paid employment.
We were particularly interested in chemotherapy
as a risk factor for long-term unemployment because
of the potential for the impact of long-term toxicities
such as neuropathy or neurocognitive effects, as well
as potential downstream effects of missed work during
treatment due to acute toxicity. To the best of our
1859

Original Article

knowledge, few studies to date have examined the
long-term impact of chemotherapy on employment
outcomes. In a study of patients diagnosed with lymphoma or endometrial or prostate cancer between
1989 and 1998 in the Netherlands, chemotherapy
receipt appeared to increase the risk of work loss.36 In
contrast, researchers who interviewed patients diagnosed with breast cancer in Quebec in 1996 and
1997 found no association between receipt of chemotherapy and employment status at the time of followup 3 years later.21 The contrast with the findings of
the current study may be the result of changes in
chemotherapy regimens and dose intensity by the
time of the current study or differences in social policies and employer accommodations between the 2
countries. The timing of the current study, which
spanned a period of national economic recession, may
also have accentuated the adverse impact of chemotherapy on employment outcomes. In a recent study
of a low-income sample of patients in the United
States, chemotherapy receipt was found to be an independent predictor of long-term failure to return to
work, a finding that is consistent with the current
study.20
The current study has several strengths, including its
large, diverse sample; longitudinal design; and access to
both clinical data and patient reports of treatment, socioeconomic characteristics, and policy-relevant outcomes.
Several limitations also merit comment. First, the study
was located in 2 large metropolitan areas, which may limit
the generalizability of the findings, particularly to more
rural areas. Second, many of our measures were drawn
from patient self-report, which may have introduced bias.
However, evidence supports the validity of self-report in
this context.37 Third, although we had access to some
clinical information, we did lack information regarding
the specific chemotherapy regimens used, thereby precluding our ability to differentiate whether certain
approaches have a greater impact on employment outcomes. We also lacked sufficient detail regarding the nature of women’s jobs to include this in the analysis, nor
did we have information concerning spousal employment.
Fourth, although the response rate to our surveys was
high, it is possible that response bias may also have influenced the results. However, we believe it is very unlikely
that correcting nonresponse bias would attenuate the association between chemotherapy and long-term employment status observed in the current study. Although we
did not have valid information regarding chemotherapy
receipt at time of sampling, patients who received chemo1860

therapy may have been less likely to complete our baseline
survey because it was administered during the treatment
period. However, we do not believe that patients treated
with chemotherapy who did not respond were less vulnerable to work loss than those who responded. In fact, the
opposite may be more plausible, to the extent that those
experiencing the greatest acute toxicity from chemotherapy might have been less likely to complete a survey at 9
months after diagnosis and might in fact have been those
most vulnerable to employment loss related to treatment.
Thus, we may actually have underestimated the negative
impact of chemotherapy on paid work outcomes. Finally,
we also lacked information regarding the employment
outcomes of women without cancer during the time of
the current study, which spanned a major recession.
Although this information was not necessary to address
our primary research question regarding the association
between adjuvant chemotherapy and long-term employment outcomes, it might have provided potentially interesting context if available. Moreover, as noted earlier,
because the recession may have accentuated any relationship between chemotherapy and subsequent unemployment, the findings of this study should not be generalized
to settings in which the economic environment differs
substantially from that experienced by the survivors we
studied.
Similar to any observational study, challenges exist
in interpreting causation. However, it appears unlikely
that women with a higher risk of job loss for other reasons
would have been more likely to receive chemotherapy.
Indeed, we explored other potential explanatory or confounding factors for differential job loss by chemotherapy
groups and did not observe an association with chemotherapy receipt, including insurance status, reasons for
stopping work (eg, retirement), or less motivation to continue work (eg, less importance of work or job seeking)
into the survivorship period. It is of course possible that
an unmeasured factor might play a confounding role.
However, the most plausible candidates for unmeasured
factors associated with both chemotherapy receipt and
with work loss act in a direction to strengthen rather than
weaken the association observed. For example, one
unmeasured factor might be the geographic microenvironment. Individuals who live in less populated areas
would be expected to have less access to chemotherapy
and also less access to jobs.
In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that loss of paid employment after a diagnosis of
breast cancer may be common, often undesired, not restricted to the treatment period, and potentially related to

the type of treatment administered. Many clinicians
believe that although patients may miss work during treatment, they will “bounce back” in the longer term. The
results of the current study suggest otherwise and highlight a possible adverse consequence of adjuvant chemotherapy. The findings reported here support current
efforts to reduce the morbidity and burden of treatments
for breast cancer.38 Indeed, such initiatives are actively
being evaluated, including better strategies to identify
those patients who might omit adjuvant chemotherapy
because the marginal benefit is small.39-41 The results of
the current study reinforce the need to advance these evaluative strategies to help physicians “first, do no harm.”
FUNDING SUPPORT
Supported by grants R01 CA109696 and R01 CA088370 from the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) to the University of Michigan. Dr.
Jagsi was supported by a Mentored Research Scholar Grant from the
American Cancer Society (MRSG-09-145-01). Dr. Katz was supported by an Established Investigator Award from the NCI
(K05CA111340). The collection of the Los Angeles County cancer
incidence data used was supported by the California Department of
Public Health as part of the statewide cancer reporting program mandated by California Health and Safety Code Section 103885; the
NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program
under contract N01-PC-35139 awarded to the University of Southern California and contract N01-PC-54404 awarded to the Public
Health Institute; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Program of Cancer Registries, under agreement
1U58DP00807-01 awarded to the Public Health Institute. The collection of metropolitan Detroit cancer incidence data was supported
