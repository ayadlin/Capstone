Neuroblastoma Cells for TNF-a–Independent Apoptosis

Abstract
Despite intensive treatment regimens, high-risk and late-stage neuroblastoma tends to have a poor survival
outcome. Overexpression of the apoptotic regulator, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), has been
associated with chemotherapy resistance in several cancers including neuroblastoma. Here, we report preclinical
evidence that XIAP offers an effective therapeutic target in neuroblastoma. Human and murine neuroblastoma
cells were treated with the Smac mimetic LBW242 alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs used clinically to
treat neuroblastoma. Expression of XIAP protein, but not mRNA, was highly increased in neuroblastoma cells
compared to healthy adrenal gland tissue, consistent with a posttranscriptional regulation of XIAP expression.
Treatment with LBW242 sensitized human and murine neuroblastoma cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis,
which was mediated by activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Although Smac
mimetics have been reported to stimulate TNF-a–induced apoptosis by degradation of cellular IAP (cIAP)-1/2, we
found that LBW242-mediated sensitization in neuroblastoma cells occurred in a TNF-a–independent manner,
despite induction of cIAP-1/2 degradation and TNF-a expression. Together, our ﬁndings show that XIAP
targeting sensitizes neuroblastoma to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, suggesting a novel therapeutic
approach to treat this childhood malignancy. Cancer Res; 72(10); 2645–56. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial tumor
during infancy and childhood originating from sympathetic
nervous tissue. More than 50% of the patients initially present
with metastatic stage IV disease. At the same time, outcome
remains poor despite of intensive treatment regimens including megatherapy followed by blood stem cell rescue, differentiation therapy, and most recently also immunotherapy (1).
Thus, the development of novel targeted therapy approaches is
urgently needed (2, 3).
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a major
intrinsic cellular suppressor of apoptosis and XIAP overexpression has been shown in several malignancies. Deregulation of
apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and contributes to development and progression of various malignancies (4). Proteins of
the IAP family are important regulators of apoptosis characAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology,

terized by the presence of the highly conserved baculovirus IAP
repeat (5). Overexpression of IAPs is associated with resistance
against chemotherapy and poor outcome in several human
cancers (6–8).
XIAP is the most potent and best characterized member of
the IAP family and is thus considered to be a key regulator of
apoptosis. XIAP directly inhibits the upstream caspase-9 and
the downstream caspases-3 and -7 and, therefore, controls
critical checkpoints of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of
apoptosis (9). According to its central role in regulation of
apoptosis, XIAP expression is controlled at multiple levels.
Transcriptional activation of XIAP expression is mainly regulated via the NF-kB pathway (10). Alternative translation
initiation via an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) located
in the 50 untranslated region of XIAP mRNA allows translational control of XIAP expression (11). At the protein level,
XIAP activity is antagonized by at least 3 speciﬁc endogenous
inhibitors (Smac/DIABLO, HtrA2/Omi, and XAF-1; refs. 12–14).
Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac)
promotes caspase activation after release from mitochondria
in response to several apoptotic stimuli. Smac interacts with
the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP via its N-terminal AVPI
tetrapeptide motif. This motif has served as a structural
template for the development of XIAP antagonists (Smac
mimetics) that disrupt XIAP–caspase interactions (7, 15). Consequently, XIAP inhibition by Smac mimetics may represent a
promising treatment strategy for malignant disease characterized by XIAP overexpression.
IAP inhibition by Smac mimetics results in induction of
apoptosis and contributes to overcoming of resistance against
chemotherapy in several hematologic malignancies and solid

tumors in vitro (7, 16). Blockade of XIAP-mediated caspase
inhibition as well as induction of TNF-a expression following
degradation of cellular IAP (cIAP) appear to contribute to the
proapoptotic effect of Smac mimetics (17–19). The potential of
Smac mimetics for the treatment of resistant malignancies is
currently evaluated in several clinical trials (20).
Here, we show for the ﬁrst time that XIAP expression is
highly upregulated in neuroblastoma via transcriptional and
posttranscriptional mechanisms and that targeted therapy
with the Smac mimetic LBW242 results in sensitization of
neuroblastoma cells against cytotoxic compounds currently
used in neuroblastoma treatment regimens. These data establish a role of Smac mimetics as promising new agents in the
treatment of resistant, thus challenging childhood malignancy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, patient samples
Cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection or German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures (DSMZ). Informed consent was obtained from all
patients and/or their guardians in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the investigation was approved by the
ethics committee of the Charite - Universit€atsmedizin Berlin
(Berlin, Germany).
Chemical compounds, biologic reagents, and drugs
Smac mimetics LBW242 and LCL161 were generously provided by Novartis Pharma. Cytostatic drugs doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Inhibitors targeting caspase-8 (Z-IETD; FMK007) and -9 (ZLEHD; FMK008) and pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD; FMK001)
were purchased from R&D.
Cellular proliferation assays
Proliferation assays were conducted with Cell Proliferation
Reagent WST-1 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates to adhere. Cytostatic
drugs and LBW242 were added to the cells for an incubation
period of 48 hours. Following incubation with WST-1 for 1 to 2
hours, absorbance was measured with an ELISA reader. IC50
and IC75 values were determined using in-house software (MS
Excel).
Detection of apoptosis by ﬂow cytometry
Cells were seeded in cell culture medium in 24-well plates to
adhere. Cells were treated with the indicated reagents for 24 to
48 hours. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-allophycocyanin (APC; 550475; BD Pharmingen) and propidium iodide (PI; 1
mg/mL in ddH2O; Invitrogen) staining and ﬂow cytometry.
Detection of active caspase-3 was conducted using an FITC
Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis kit (550480; BD Pharmingen)
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δcm)
To measure the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), the cationic dye JC-1 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol and detected by ﬂow
cytometry.

Detection of active caspases-8 or -9 with Caspase-Glo
assays or green caspase staining kits
Active caspases-8 or -9 was detected using Caspase-Glo 8
and 9 assays (Promega) according to the manufacturer's
protocol or Green Caspase-8 or -9 Staining Kits (PromoKine)
according to the manufacturer's protocol and ﬂow
cytometry.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Standard procedures
for Western blotting were followed using the following antibodies: caspase-3 (#9662; Cell Signaling), cIAP-1 (AF8181;
R&D), cIAP-2 (AF8171; R&D), PARP (#9542; Cell Signaling),
and XIAP (ab21278; Abcam; all 1:1,000); and b-actin-peroxidase
(A3854; Sigma-Aldrich; 1:10,000).
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative realtime PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit
(Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Equal amounts of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using
oligo p(dT)15 primers (Roche) and SuperScript III Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
carried out using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix and a
StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Speciﬁc ampliﬁcation of cDNA
was detected with SYBR Green and melt curve analysis.
Relative expression of target genes was calculated as a ratio
of the expression level of the target gene to that of 18S rRNA
determined in the same sample using the comparative
threshold (DDCt) method.
Gene knockdown using antisense oligonucleotides
Cells were transfected for 48 to 72 hours in 24-well plates
using DharmaFECT 2 (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and the transfection
protocol as recommended from the manufacturer. For transient knockdowns, XIAP antisense (AS) oligonucleotide
AEG35156 and scrambled control AEG35187 were generously
provided by Aegera Therapeutics (21).
Microarray analysis
Data from Affymetrix HuEx1.0 arrays (GEO acc. no.
GSE32664) were reanalyzed for XIAP expression. Exon level
expression was recovered using Affymetrix power tools 1.10.0.
In total, expression data from 101 primary neuroblastomas
from the German and European clinical neuroblastoma trials
were included in this study.
NXS2 mouse model of neuroblastoma
Syngeneic female A/J mice (6–8 weeks old) were obtained
(Harlan Laboratories) and housed according to the German
guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (Tierschutzgesetz). The NXS2 model was used as previously described (22).
Brieﬂy, primary tumors were induced by subcutaneous injection of 2  106 NXS2 cells. Cohorts of mice were treated 1 day

of vincristine and LCL161. Primary tumor growth was analyzed
by microcaliper, measurements and tumor volume was calculated according to the formula: (1/2)  length  width2. The
weight of primary tumors was also determined after surgical

Statistics
Combination indices (CI) for the cellular proliferation assays
were calculated using the Chou–Talay method (23) to determine synergism (CI < 1), additivity (CI ¼ 1), or antagonism (CI
> 1), if combining LBW242 with cytostatic drugs. The CI was
calculated according to the classic isobologram equation: CI ¼

used in combination.
Statistical signiﬁcance of differences between treatment
groups was determined using a Student t test for in vitro data
or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for in vivo data. A 2-tailed P value
0.05 was considered as signiﬁcant.

Results
Expression of XIAP in neuroblastoma
Microarray analysis of 101 tumor samples from children
with neuroblastoma revealed consistent XIAP expression in all
analyzed cases (Fig. 1A). XIAP mRNA expression was increased
in patients suffering from relapse (P < 0.004) and tumors with

MYCN ampliﬁcation (Fig. 1B and C). To further examine
regulation of XIAP expression in neuroblastoma, human
[n ¼ 2; Kelly (MYCN-ampliﬁed) and SK-N-SH (MYCN wildtype)] and murine (n ¼ 2; NXS2 and C1300) neuroblastoma cell
lines were analyzed by qRT-PCR for expression of XIAP mRNA.
Murine adrenal glands (n ¼ 5) served as a healthy tissue
reference for basal expression levels, one of the main locations
of neuroblastoma development (2). Interestingly, the analysis
did not reveal relevant upregulation of XIAP mRNA expression
in neuroblastoma cell lines compared with healthy adrenal
gland tissue (Fig. 1D). In contrast, we found a 20- to 200-fold
increase of survivin mRNA expression by qRT-PCR analysis, a
well-known phenomenon in neuroblastoma (24). However,

dent inhibition of cell proliferation (0.1–5 mmol/L). Cotreatment with LBW242 was not able to enhance the antiproliferative potential of etoposide (Fig. 2B and Tables 1 and 2).
Doxorubicin inhibited the cell proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines to a similar extent as etoposide in a concentrationdependent manner. Addition of LBW242 synergistically
enhanced the antiproliferative effect of doxorubicin in all cell
lines except NXS2 (Fig. 2C and Tables 1 and 2).
The vinca alkaloid vincristine revealed only a moderate
effect on proliferation and the human neuroblastoma cell line
Kelly was resistant. Here, addition of LBW242 resulted in a
strong synergistic vincristine-induced inhibition of proliferation in all cell lines and was effective to overcome vincristine
resistance in Kelly cells (Fig. 2D and Tables 1 and 2).

Western blot analysis revealed a strong overexpression of the
XIAP protein in all neuroblastoma cell lines and primary
human neuroblastoma tissue samples (Fig. 1E). These results
strongly suggest transcriptional and posttranscriptional upregulation of XIAP in neuroblastoma. On the basis of this
observation, we analyzed the impact of XIAP inhibition by
Smac mimetics as a strategy to improve the chemotherapeutic
efﬁciency.
Inhibition of cell proliferation by combined treatment
with LBW242 and chemotherapy in neuroblastoma
We ﬁrst evaluated proliferation of murine (n ¼ 2) and
human (n ¼ 2) neuroblastoma cells in the presence of
increasing amounts of Smac mimetic LBW242 used as a
monotherapy. Relevant inhibition of proliferation was only
observed at very high concentrations of LBW242 in the
micromolar range (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Because LBW242
is toxic to normal tissue at concentrations higher than 10
mmol/L (25), experiments addressing LBW242 combinations
with cytotoxic therapy were carried out at 10 mmol/L. At this
concentration, no relevant inhibition of cell proliferation
was achieved by LBW242 alone.
Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide showed a concentration-depen-

Sensitization of neuroblastoma cells for chemotherapyinduced apoptosis by LBW242
We next questioned whether LBW242-induced decrease in
neuroblastoma cell proliferation is due to induction of
apoptosis.
All cell lines tested were sensitive to etoposide-induced
apoptosis. Combination with LBW242 resulted in a weak
sensitization for etoposide only (Fig. 3A). Higher etoposide
concentrations or LBW242 dose-escalation were not able to

further increase the LBW242 effect (Supplementary Fig. S1 and

In 3 of the tested cell lines, only minor sensitization for
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was achieved by LBW242. In
contrast to the other cell lines, the human neuroblastoma cell
line SK-N-SH was highly susceptible for doxorubicin. In this cell
line, LBW242 caused a distinct sensitization for doxorubicininduced apoptosis (Fig. 3B).
According to the proliferation data, the most pronounced
effect on apoptosis induction was observed for the combination of vincristine and LBW242. In all cell lines but
NXS2 treatment with LBW242 resulted in a distinct sensi-

Similar to etoposide, even escalation of LBW242 concentrations up to 40 mmol/L did not result in sensitization of
NXS2 cells for vincristine-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To directly conﬁrm a role of XIAP in the resistance of
neuroblastoma cells against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis,
we analyzed the effect of XIAP knockdown in vincristineresistant Kelly cells. XIAP protein and mRNA expression was

XIAP Inhibition in Neuroblastoma

Figure 4. Effect of LBW242 and vincristine on caspase-3 and downstream target PARP in neuroblastoma cells. MYCN-ampliﬁed Kelly cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of LBW242, vincristine (A and B) and 100 mmol/L pan-caspase (pan-C) inhibitor (B). Protein abundance of caspase-3,
cleaved caspase-3, PARP, and cleaved PARP as well as actin was detected by Western blot analysis after 48 hours (A). The proportion of cells positive for
active caspase-3 was determined by ﬂow cytometry 24 or 48 hours after treatment initiation (B). Values represent the mean  SD of 3 independent
experiments.  , P < 0.05. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.

AEG35156 did not cause relevant cIAP-1 protein and mRNA
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). XIAP knockdown by AEG35156 strongly enhanced apoptosis induction in
Kelly cells, but no synergistic effect was detected in combination with vincristine (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Similarly, XIAP
knockdown in SK-N-SH and SH-EP cells did result in strong
induction of apoptosis alone and in addition to vincristine
(Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4).
To further investigate the role of XIAP in the regulation of
apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, we selected the cell line Kelly
as a model system. Comparison of apoptosis induction after 24
and 48 hours revealed that LBW242 enhanced vincristineinduced apoptosis in Kelly cells in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 3C and D).
Next, we decided to provide additional proof that LBW242
treatment results in stimulation of vincristine-induced apoptotic cell death. For this purpose, we determined cleavage of
caspase-3 and its target PARP, which are critical hallmarks of
apoptosis. Treatment with vincristine or LBW242 alone caused
only weak cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, correlating with the
limited effect on induction of apoptosis. In contrast, simultaneous treatment of vincristine and LBW242 strongly induced
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 4A) in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 4B). Caspase-3 cleavage was almost completely
abrogated by pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (Fig. 4B), indicating
that the effect of LBW242 is mediated by activation of
upstream caspases.
LBW242 cooperates with vincristine to induce activation
of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways
For further characterization of the molecular pathways
involved in the sensitization for vincristine-induced apoptosis
by LBW242, we examined the effect of LBW242 on the vincristine-induced activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Blockade of LBW242/vincristine-induced
apoptosis by speciﬁc and pan-caspase inhibition as well as
cleavage of caspases-8 and -9 and loss of the MMP were
determined by luminometry or ﬂow cytometry after treatment
with LBW and/or vincristine.

www.aacrjournals.org

Sensitization for vincristine-induced apoptosis by LBW242
was similarly reduced by inhibition of caspases-8 and -9,
respectively. This ﬁnding was consistent with pan-caspase
inhibition by Z-VAD, which completely abrogated the effect
of LBW242 (Fig. 5A).
Activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is mediated by
complex mitochondrial processes resulting in the loss of MMP.
Cotreatment of LBW242 and vincristine caused strong loss of
MMP in a time-dependent manner indicating activation of the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Fig. 5B). At the same time, the
LBW242-mediated increase of vincristine-induced activation
of caspase-9 was abrogated by caspase inhibition (Fig. 5C).
Furthermore, we show a time-dependent activation of the
extrinsic apoptosis pathway reﬂected by activation of caspase8 using LBW242 in combination with vincristine and again, this
effect could be blocked by addition of the caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD (Fig. 5D).
To conﬁrm these ﬁndings in our Kelly model system, we
investigated the effect of LBW242 on activation of intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptosis pathways in 2 further human neuroblastoma cell lines. In SK-N-SH as well as SH-EP cells LBW242
signiﬁcantly increased vincristine-induced activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9 (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4).
Induction of TNF-a expression and degradation of IAPs
by combined treatment with Smac mimetics and
chemotherapy
Degradation of cIAP-1/2 and subsequent induction of TNFa synthesis have been described as a molecular mechanism of
Smac mimetic–induced apoptosis in distinct cell types. Therefore, we explored whether LBW242 alone or in combination
with vincristine results in degradation of cIAP-1/2 and induction of TNF-a expression in neuroblastoma cells.
Surprisingly, LBW242 alone did not cause signiﬁcant degradation of cIAP-1/2 after 48 hours (Fig. 6A). Time course
experiments revealed transient degradation of cIAP-1 (but not
cIAP-2) after 30 minutes, but cIAP1 levels rapidly recovered
thereafter (Fig. 6B). In contrast, combination of LWB242 and
vincristine resulted in strong and sustained degradation of

MYCN-ampliﬁed Kelly cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of LBW242, vincristine (A–D), and 100 mmol/L caspase inhibitors (A, C, and D). The
proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry 48 hours after treatment initiation (A). The proportion of cells with decreased MMP was
determined by ﬂow cytometry 24 or 48 hours after treatment initiation. Values represent the mean  SD of 3 independent experiments (B). Active caspase-8 (C)
or caspase-9 (D) was determined by luminometry 12, 24, or 48 hours after treatment. Luminescence in untreated cells was deﬁned as 100%. Values represent
the mean  SD of 3 independent experiments (A and B) or triplicates (C and D).  , P < 0.05. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.

cIAP-1/2 (Fig. 6A). As expected, no relevant XIAP degradation
was induced by LBW242 in the presence and absence of
vincristine.
Similarly, only weak increase of TNF-a mRNA levels was
detected following treatment with LBW242 or vincristine
alone. In contrast, combined treatment of Kelly cells with
LBW242 and vincristine resulted in an about 10-fold induction
of TNF-a mRNA synthesis (Fig. 6C). Therefore, induction of
apoptosis by combination of LBW242 and vincristine appears
to be due to sustained degradation of cIAP-1/2 followed by
induction of TNF-a expression.
Blockade of TNF-a by a speciﬁc monoclonal antibody
(adalimumab; Humira) was not able to impede sensitization
of Kelly cells for vincristine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6D).

Cancer Res; 72(10) May 15, 2012

Consequently, treatment with LBW242 did not signiﬁcantly
sensitize Kelly cells for exogenous TNF-a (Fig. 6E). Induction of TNF-a expression was also detected after combination of LBW242 with etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S5). As
LBW242 does not sensitize neuroblastoma cells for etoposide-induced apoptosis, this notion again supports the
hypothesis that sensitization of neuroblastoma cells for
chemotherapy by LBW242 does not occur in a TNFa–dependent manner.
Again these ﬁndings were conﬁrmed in 2 further human
neuroblastoma cell lines. In SK-N-SH as well as SH-EP cells,
TNF-a inhibition by adalimumab did not abrogate the
LBW242-mediated sensitization for vincristine-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4).

XIAP Inhibition in Neuroblastoma

Figure 6. Effect of LBW242 and vincristine treatment on XIAP, cIAP-1/2, and TNF-a expression in neuroblastoma cells. MYCN-ampliﬁed Kelly cells
were treated with the indicated concentrations of LBW242, vincristine, TNF-a, or adalimumab (Humira; A–E). Protein abundance of XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, as
well as actin was detected by Western blot analysis 48 hours (A) or 0 to 48 h after treatment initiation (B). TNF-a mRNA expression levels were determined
by qRT-PCR (C). The proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry 48 hours after treatment initiation (D and E). Values represent the
mean  SD of 3 independent experiments (C) or triplicates (D and E).  , P > 0.59 (D) and P > 0.3 (E). DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.

Inhibition of tumor growth by LBW242 in a
neuroblastoma mouse model
Finally, we evaluated the in vivo efﬁcacy of LCL161, a closely
related analogue of LBW242 (26), alone or in combination with
vincristine in an NXS2 cell–based neuroblastoma mouse model
established in our laboratory. In vivo treatment with LCL161
caused a strong reduction of tumor growth as determined by
tumor volume and weight (Fig. 7A and B). LCL161 cooperated
with vincristine resulting in a signiﬁcant sensitization for
vincristine-induced inhibition of primary neuroblastoma
tumor growth in vivo (P < 0.05). Parallel analysis of body weight
revealed no signs of treatment-related toxicity (data not
shown).
These ﬁndings show antitumor activity of LCL161 together
with vincristine in an in vivo neuroblastoma mouse model
without detectable toxicity.

Discussion
Despite intensive chemotherapy regimens, the prognosis of
children with stage IV neuroblastoma is poor (1, 2). The
resistance against chemotherapy is most likely due to deregulation of apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Therefore, the

www.aacrjournals.org

development of strategies restoring the apoptotic program in
resistant neuroblastoma cells may help to improve treatment
of these patients.
There is accumulating evidence that XIAP plays a central
role in the regulation of apoptosis sensitivity in cancer cells
(5, 27–29). Here, we show for the ﬁrst time that XIAP expression
is highly elevated in neuroblastoma cells most likely contributing to the resistance against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, our data indicate upregulation of XIAP
expression by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Within a population of 101 patients with neuroblastoma,
microarray data showed an association of increased XIAP
mRNA expression with risk for relapse. On the other hand,
comparing murine neuroblastoma cells and healthy adrenal
gland tissue, we did detect highly increased XIAP protein
expression but no regulation of XIAP mRNA. According to the
role of n-myc as important transcriptional activator, XIAP
mRNA expression is increased in MYCN-ampliﬁed tumors. In
contrast, posttranscriptional regulation of XIAP expression
appears to occur independent of MYCN ampliﬁcation status.
Posttranscriptional regulation of XIAP expression has been
suggested in several hematologic and non hematologic malignancies (7, 27, 30–32) and this concept seems to hold up also for

neuroblastoma. Posttranscriptional regulation of XIAP expression is controlled by alternative translation initiation via an
IRES that is essential for maintenance of XIAP protein expression during cellular stress (11). Increased XIAP protein expression resulting from enhanced XIAP IRES activity has been
shown during tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy induced by interleukin-6 in cholangiocarcinoma (33).
Overexpression of IRES-stimulating proteins might also contribute to increased XIAP IRES activity in childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (34–37).
Enhanced protein stability represents an alternative possible mechanism resulting in posttranscriptional upregulation of
XIAP expression (31). Phosphorylation of XIAP by AKT (38) as
well as binding of the IAP family member survivin to XIAP (39)
have been shown to stabilize XIAP protein and to reduce
proteasomal degradation of XIAP.
Targeting XIAP using Smac mimetics is a promising new
strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance in malignant
cells. It becomes increasingly evident that the regulation of
apoptosis by XIAP occurs in a cell type- and stimulus-dependent manner. Accordingly, the effect of LBW242 in neuroblastoma showed a distinct variation between different cell lines
and cytostatic drugs used for induction of apoptosis.
Whereas LBW242 alone does not result in a relevant induction of apoptosis in neuroblastoma, LBW242 can be used as
sensitizer to restore and enhance the responsiveness of neuroblastoma cells toward chemotherapy in vitro. Several Smac
mimetics (including LBW242) have been shown to reduce
tumor growth in mouse models of different malignant tumors
(19, 25, 28, 40). Using an NXS2 cell–based neuroblastoma
mouse model, we detected a signiﬁcant sensitization for
vincristine-induced inhibition of primary neuroblastoma
growth by LCL161 (a closely related structural analogue of
LBW242) in vivo. This again emphasizes the relevance of XIAP
as therapeutic target for Smac mimetics in neuroblastoma.

2654

Cancer Res; 72(10) May 15, 2012

The drugs used in our experiments are known to induce
apoptosis by different mechanisms. LBW242 sensitized neuroblastoma cells to apoptosis induced by inhibition of mitotic
spindle assembly (vincristine) or by intercalating DNA (doxorubicin). It remains unclear that why apoptosis induction by
inhibition of DNA repair (etoposide) was not stimulated by IAP
inhibition using LBW242.
Recent reports suggest induction of necroptosis but not
apoptosis by Smac mimetics under certain circumstances (41,
42). Nevertheless, sensitization of neuroblastoma cells for
chemotherapy was mediated via activation of apoptosis, as
indicated by cleavage of caspases-3, -8, -9 and PARP as well as
blockade of cell death by caspase inhibition.
Originally, the major proapoptotic effect of Smac mimetics
was attributed to direct inhibition of XIAP-mediated blockade
of caspase activation. Therefore, Smac mimetics were designed
to bind to the BIR domains of IAPs to activate caspase-3/7
(BIR2; refs. 43, 44) or caspase-9 (BIR3; refs. 17–19, 40, 45, 46). As
LBW242 targets the BIR3 domain, treatment of neuroblastoma
cells resulted in caspase-9 activation. Interestingly, caspase-9
activation occurred after combination of LBW242 with vincristine only, but not by LBW242 alone. Notably also a doseescalation of LBW242 up to 100 mmol/L did not result in
measurable activation of caspase-9 (Supplementary Fig. S6A).
LBW242 binds to cIAP with much higher afﬁnity than to
XIAP (45), but in contrast to XIAP, cIAP-1/2 cannot inhibit
caspases directly (47). Recent reports showed a different
mechanism of apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics involving cIAP-1/2 (17–19). According to their response to Smac
mimetics, tumor cells have been classiﬁed into 3 cell types (48).
In sensitive tumor cells, Smac mimetics induce degradation of
cIAP-1/2 that is followed by a stimulation of autocrine TNF-a
synthesis. In addition, degradation of cIAP-1/2 results in
sensitization against TNF-a–induced apoptosis, as in the
absence of cIAP-1/2, complex-I detaches from the TNF-R1

XIAP Inhibition in Neuroblastoma

favoring the formation of a RIP1-dependent caspase-8–activating complex (complex-IIB; ref. 19). The second cell type does
not respond to Smac mimetics alone and there is no induction
of autocrine TNF-a synthesis. Nevertheless, a sensitization
against TNF-a by Smac mimetics occurs, as addition of exogenous TNF-a results in apoptosis induction. Tumor cells of the
third type do not respond to cotreatment with Smac mimetics
and TNF-a.
In neuroblastoma, we did not detect relevant cIAP-1/2
degradation, TNF-a induction, or caspase-8 activation (nor
induction of apoptosis) by LBW242 alone (Fig. 6A–C and
Supplementary Fig. S6B). Furthermore, neuroblastoma cells
were not sensitized for exogenous TNF-a by LBW242. Therefore, neuroblastoma cells appear to be nonresponsive to
LBW242. Vincristine alone resulted in a weak increase in
TNF-a synthesis, but no activation of caspase-8, nor relevant
induction of apoptosis. In contrast, cotreatment with
LBW242 and vincristine resulted in cIAP-1/2 degradation,
TNF-a induction, and caspase-8 activation (as well as
induction of apoptosis). Surprisingly, sensitization for vincristine-induced apoptosis by LBW242 was not dependent on
TNF-a. Recent reports indicating that Smac mimetics induced
stimulation of ripoptosome assembly followed by apoptosis in
a TNF-a–independent manner provide a possible explanation
for this phenomenon (42, 49).
In contrast to LBW242 treatment, XIAP knockdown resulted
in signiﬁcant induction of apoptosis, most likely by a more
pronounced derepression of caspases, but no synergistic effect
with vincristine was detected.
In conclusion, our data emphasize the important role of
XIAP mediating resistance against chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis in neuroblastoma and we show a role for targeted

therapy using Smac mimetics in combination with cytotoxic
compounds. These ﬁndings provide an important baseline to
further elaborate XIAP inhibition as a strategy to overcome
resistance against chemotherapy in neuroblastoma in the
clinical setting.
