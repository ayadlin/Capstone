SUMMARY
Melanoma is the deadliest form of commonly encountered skin cancers because of its rapid
progression towards metastasis1,2. Although metabolic reprogramming is tightly associated with
tumor progression, whether metabolic regulatory circuits affect metastatic processes is poorly
understood. PGC1α is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis,
protects against oxidative stress3, and reprograms melanoma metabolism to influence drug
sensitivity and survival4,5. Here, we provide data to indicate that PGC1α suppresses melanoma
metastasis, acting through a pathway distinct from its bioenergetic functions. Elevated PGC1α
expression inversely correlates with vertical growth in human melanomas. PGC1α silencing
makes nonmetastatic melanoma cells highly invasive and conversely, PGC1α reconstitution

suppresses metastasis. Within populations of melanoma cells, there is a marked heterogeneity in
PGC1α levels, which predicts their inherent high or low metastatic capacity. Mechanistically,
PGC1α directly increases transcription of ID2, which in turn binds to and inactivates the
transcription factor TCF4. Inactive TCF4 causes downregulation of metastasis-related genes
including integrins that are known to influence invasion and metastasis6–8. Inhibition of
BRAFV600E using vemurafenib9, independently of its cytostatic effects, suppresses metastasis by
acting on the PGC1α-ID2-TCF4-integrin axis. Taken together, our findings reveal that PGC1α
maintains mitochondrial energetic metabolism and suppresses metastasis through direct regulation
of parallel acting transcriptional programs. Consequently, components of these circuits define new
therapeutic opportunities that may help curb melanoma metastasis.

Whereas the landscape of genetic alterations and multiple driver mutations have been
discovered in melanoma10,11, less is understood about the genes driving metastasis2.
Nevertheless, it is thought that efficient metastasis requires the malignant cell to balance
proliferation with invasion and migration12,13. We recently found that elevated expression of
the metabolic integrator and transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC1α or PPARGC1A) defines a subset of melanomas
wherein it promotes mitochondrial metabolism, protects against oxidative stress, and
enhances survival4,5. Although high PGC1α expression is associated with worse prognosis
in metastatic melanomas4,5, reduced levels coincide with invasive/vertical growth in primary
specimens (Fig. 1a). Therefore, we investigated the effects of PGC1α in invasion and
metastasis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of expression data (GSE36879)4 upon
PGC1α knockdown in the non-metastatic melanoma cell line A375P revealed a coordinated
upregulation of genes implicated in metastasis, including genes that control focal adhesion
or extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, integrins and components of the transforming
growth factor-β (TGFβ) and Wnt signaling (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b)14–17. In addition,
PGC1α expression showed an inverse correlation with gene sets involved in melanoma
metastasis (Extended Data Fig. 1c, d). Upregulation of pro-metastatic genes following
PGC1α suppression was confirmed by qPCR in PGC1α-positive melanoma cell lines (Fig.
1b, Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Conversely, the increase in integrin transcripts was reverted
upon ectopic PGC1α expression (Extended Data Fig. 2e, f). Targeting PGC1α using the
CRISPR/Cas9 system led to similar gene expression changes (Extended Data Fig. 2g).

Consistent with lower PGC1α expression during vertical growth and acquisition of the
metastatic phenotype, the PGC1α-suppressed invasive and metastatic gene signature was
associated with worse primary melanoma survival (Fig. 1c). Changes in integrin expression
upon PGC1α depletion were accompanied by activation of the downstream kinase focal
adhesion kinase (FAK)18 (Fig. 1d), and increases in migration and invasion (Fig. 1e). FAK
inhibition blocked the enhanced migration induced by PGC1α depletion (Extended Data
Fig. 2h–j). Remarkably, PGC1α silencing by either shRNA (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 3a,
b) or CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. 1g) converted these low-invasive, PGC1α-positive cells into highly
metastatic entities as assessed by tail-vein injection experiments. To fully recapitulate the
metastatic process in vivo, we used MeWo cells in an orthotropic metastasis model19 and
found that, again, PGC1α suppression caused the subcutaneously implanted tumors to
generate systemic disease (Fig. 1h). Conversely, reconstitution of PGC1α in the PGC1α-

negative cells A375 and A2058 decreased integrin expression (Fig. 1i, Extended Data Fig.
3c, d) and compromised their invasiveness in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1j, k). Together, these
results indicate that PGC1α inhibits a pro-metastatic program in melanoma cells resulting in
the suppression of invasion and metastasis.

Melanomas are highly heterogeneous and might switch between a proliferative and an
invasive/metastatic phenotype13. Using MitoTracker to label mitochondria and FACS
analysis, we found that melanoma cell lines with heightened PGC1α expression displayed
heterogeneous mitochondrial mass (Fig. 2a), which was dynamically regulated (Extended
Data Fig. 4a), and hence could implicate alternate mitochondrial biogenesis and PGC1α
function during phenotype switching. The sorted mitochondria-high (mito/PGC1α-high)
population expressed significantly higher PGC1α and mitochondrial components, as well as
lower integrins compared to the mitochondria-low (mito/PGC1α-low) population (Fig. 2a,
b). The PGC1α-low population showed enhanced migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo
(Fig. 2c, d). Compared to the non-migrating population, melanoma cells that had migrated
through the trans-well membrane expressed lower amounts of PGC1α and higher prometastatic transcripts (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 4b). To strengthen the link between
PGC1α and metabolic heterogeneity with metastatic spread, we isolated circulating tumor
cells (CTCs) from the blood of mice bearing subcutaneous PGC1α-positive MeWo tumors
(Extended Data Fig. 4c). Notably, these CTCs exhibited lower levels of PGC1α, but elevated
integrins compared to the primary tumors (Fig 2f). However, in the corresponding lung
metastases, which had formed from CTCs, PGC1α transcripts increased to similar levels as
in the primary tumors (Fig. 2g). Demonstrating that increases in PGC1α in established
metastases confer growth advantages similar to primary melanomas4,20, restoration of
PGC1α in lung metastases derived from PGC1α knockdown cells enhanced tumor
progression (Fig. 2h, Extended Data Fig. 4d). In aggregate, these results indicate that
melanoma cells display heterogeneous levels of PGC1α and mitochondria. The mito/
PGC1α-low population expresses a pro-metastatic gene program, while the mito/PGC1αhigh population drives a proliferation phenotype.

To assess the mechanisms by which PGC1α suppresses this pro-metastatic program, we
surveyed genes upregulated upon PGC1α suppression for potential negative transcriptional
regulators. We identified two Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins—ID2 and ID3, among
the top differentially expressed genes. Levels of ID2 and ID3, but not ID1 or ID4, were
reduced in melanoma cells upon PGC1α knockdown and increased by PGC1α (Extended
Data Fig. 5a–c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that PGC1α was bound at
the ID2 promoter, suggesting direct transcriptional regulation (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Next,
we depleted ID2 and ID3 in PGC1α-positive melanoma cells and found that suppression of
ID2, but not ID3, increased integrin expression and downstream signaling (Fig. 3a, Extended
Data Fig. 5e–i). Similar to PGC1α knockdown, ID2 depletion also strongly promoted
migration, invasion and lung metastasis (Fig. 3b, c, Extended Data Fig. 5j). To test whether
ID2 mediates the repressive effect of PGC1α, we ectopically expressed ID2 in PGC1αdepleted cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a). ID2 expression suppressed the induction of the
prometastatic programs, invasion and metastasis enforced by PGC1α depletion (Fig. 3d–f,
Extended Data Fig. 6b, c). Similar results were observed when ID2 was ectopically
expressed in PGC1α-negative melanoma cells (Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). However,

depletion of ID2, in contrast to PGC1α, did not alter glucose metabolism (Extended Data
Fig. 6g). Taken together, these data indicate that the ID2 inhibitor is a downstream target of
PGC1α suppressing pro-metastatic transcriptional programs without affecting PGC1α
metabolic function.

ID2 functions as a transcriptional inhibitor through direct heterodimerization with basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors, blocking binding to promoters21–23. To find bHLH
factor(s) that could regulate integrin expression and metastasis driven by PGC1α
suppression, we surveyed two different protein-protein interaction databases. BioGRID24
displayed 34 unique ID2 interactors including the bHLH transcription factors TCF3, TCF4,
MyoD and TCF12 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). STRING25 revealed three bHLH transcription
factors (MYC, TCF3, TCF4) in the top 10 predicted partners (Extended Data Fig. 7b).
Among these factors, only suppression of TCF4 (Transcription factor 4) was able to
consistently decrease integrin expression in both A375P-shPGC1α and PGC1α-negative
cells (Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). Knockdown of TCF4 prevented the induction of integrins
and FAK phosphorylation upon PGC1α or ID2 suppression (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 8a,
b). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that TCF4 binds to ID2 in A375P cells (Fig. 3h).
Consistent with this interaction, while the recruitment of TCF4 to promoters of integrins was
increased upon PGC1α or ID2 knockdown, ectopic expression of ID2 blunted TCF4
recruitment (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Ectopic expression of TCF4 was sufficient to induce
integrin expression and signaling (Fig. 3i, Extended Data Fig. 8d), concordant with TCF4
recruitment to their promoters (Fig. 3j). TCF4 knockdown abrogated the enhanced migration
and metastasis of cells with PGC1α or ID2 suppression (Fig. 3k, l), and in PGC1α-negative
cells (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Notably, expression of PGC1α and TCF4 in cell lines and
tumors was mutually exclusive (Extended Data Fig. 8f, g), further supporting the opposite
link between PGC1α and TCF4. Similar to ID2, manipulation of TCF4 levels did not alter
cellular metabolism (Extended Data Fig. 8h), indicating that PGC1α’s effects on metastasis
is separable from its metabolic functions. Collectively, TCF4 is required for the prometastatic transcriptional program upon PGC1α suppression leading to increased invasion
and metastasis.

PLX4032, a BRAFV600E inhibitor, has been shown to increase PGC1α expression in
melanoma cells harboring this mutation5,9,26. Based on our results described here, PLX4032
could inhibit metastasis by acting on the PGC1α transcriptional axis. Treatment of
BRAFV600E melanoma cells with PLX4032 or MEK inhibitors highly induced PGC1α and
ID2 expression (Fig. 4a), and reduced levels of most integrins tested (Fig. 4b, c, Extended
Data Fig. 9a). Consistently, PLX4032 increased the recruitment of PGC1α to the ID2
promoter (Extended Data Fig. 9b) and strongly induced the interaction between ID2 and
TCF4 (Fig. 4d), decreasing TCF4 promoter occupancy at four integrin genes (Fig. 4e).
Despite FAK activation, measured as phospho-Y397-FAK levels, was slightly inhibited upon
MAPK blockage (Fig. 4c), PLX4032 was able to repress melanoma invasion in vitro and
metastasis in vivo, which was largely reversed by PGC1α or ID2 depletion (Fig. 4f, g,
Extended Data Fig. 9c). Within the time frame of the in vitro assay (24 hours), PLX4032 did
not decrease cell growth (Extended Data Fig. 9d), and the dose of PLX4032 used in mice (1
mg/kg) was lower than the dose used to induce tumor regression27. Taken together, these
data indicate that PLX4032 can suppress invasion and metastasis, independently of its

cytotoxic effects. PLX4032-induced metastasis inhibition is mediated, at least in part,
through transcriptional activation of PGC1α.

Our results overall indicate that the metabolic transcriptional coactivator PGC1α is an apical
regulator of melanoma progression through protection against oxidative stress which confers
survival and proliferative advantages4,5,20, and suppression of cell motility, cell-cell
interaction, adhesion and invasion that promotes metastatic drive. Strikingly, PGC1α
expression inversely correlates with invasive growth in local disease; while in metastatic
melanomas, it associates with worse outcomes. Although PGC1α defines a subset of
melanomas with specific characteristics, its heterogeneous expression within tumors allows
different proliferative or invasive abilities (Fig. 4h). We argue that the heterogeneity of
PGC1α levels within melanomas reflects a dualistic nature of PGC1α function—promoting
growth and survival of tumors, while suppressing metastatic spread. This heterogeneity
might be important during melanoma progression through PGC1α changes in response to
different signals including nutrients, and switching between survival/proliferation and
invasion/metastasis. From a therapeutic standpoint, independent of the cytotoxic/cytostatic
effects, our results extend the clinical benefits of the BRAFV600E-targeted drugs to impact
metastasis. For melanoma treatment, BRAFV600E-inhibitors may have heightened
therapeutic benefits if applied at an earlier stage by inducing PGC1α and reducing
metastatic propensity. Moreover, selection of cells with lower PGC1α may promote
metastasis, such as within BRAFV600E inhibitor-treated RAS-mutant melanomas or
BRAFV600E inhibitor-resistant melanomas28, as these samples reactivate ERK/MEK
signaling and reduce PGC1α expression. Finally, targeting the components downstream of
PGC1α that drive metastasis could provide new therapeutic opportunities for melanoma and
other malignancies such as prostate cancer29.

Published datasets GSE318931 and GSE1239132 with associated pathological stages for
each sample as Invasive/Vertical or Superficial/Radial were analyzed for relative deviation
from median-normalized PGC1α intensities (linear) within each dataset (significance based
on 2-sample, 2-sided t-test statistics). To examine the enrichment of the PGC1α-regulated
metastasis/invasion signature genes (ITGA3, ITGA4, ITGA10, ITGB3, ITGB5, CAV1,
CAV2, ACTN2, LAMA4A, COL4A1, INHBA, TGFBI, TGFBR3, TGFBR2, SMAD3,
SMAD7, IL8, IL11, LEF1, TCF7L2, DKK3, PPP3CA and SFRP1), we performed ssGSEA
projections33 to yield a percentile-based Normalized Enrichment Score within each of
GSE3189 and GSE12391, which were used to combine the datasets (2-sample, 2-sided t-test
statistics). The association between primary melanoma survival and PGC1α-regulated
metastasis/invasion signature was based on ssGSEA for signature closeness within
GSE57715 and calculation of log-rank survival.
For the analysis of PGC1α and TCF4 gene expression, data obtained from the TCGA skin
cutaneous melanoma dataset34 consisting of 471 samples with RNAseq data was

For PGC1α overexpression by adenovirus, A375P-shPGC1α and A375 cells were infected
with adenoviruses expressing GFP or Flag-PGC1α for 36 h, followed by qPCR. PGC1α
targets such as GSTM4 and COX5A were used as positive controls. For inhibitor treatment,
cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 6 h and mRNAs were
analyzed by qPCR. For the RNA from migratory and non-migratory cells, migration of the
A375P and G361 cells was initiated as described below. The non-migratory cells in
suspension in the upper chambers were collected by centrifugation and resuspension in lysis
buffer from the Cells-to-cDNA II kit (Invitrogen). The migratory cells were collected by
directly applying the lysis buffer to the membrane, following the wash and clearing of the
non-migratory cells in the upper chambers. 18S rRNA was used as internal control. For cells
from paraffin-embedded tissue sections, Pinpoint™ Slide RNA Isolation System II (Zymo
Research) was used to extract RNAs.
Cell Sorting—Cells with different mitochondrial contents were sorted based on the
labeling of MitoTracker Green (Invitrogen). Briefly, MitoTracker Green was spiked in the
medium of 100% confluent melanoma cells at the final concentration of 75 μM, and
incubated with the cells for 20 min, followed by FACS sorting at DFCI Flow Cytometry
Core. The top 10% cell population with the highest mitochondrial contents (mito/PGC1αhigh) and the bottom 10% cell population with the lowest mitochondrial contents (mito/

In vivo metastasis assays—Melanoma cell lines were lifted by 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS
and washed with 1X PBS. For the intravenous injection, a total of 3 × 105 (A375) or 1 × 106
(G361 and MeWo) or 2 × 106 (A375P and FACS-sorted MeWo) cells in 0.2 mL of DMEM
were injected into the tail vein of 6-week-old male nude mice. No randomization or blind
techniques were applied in this study. To assess the degree of tumor formation in the lung,
bioluminescence imaging of living mice were performed on a Xenogen IVIS-50TM imaging
systems equipped with an isoflurane (1~3%) anesthesia system and a temperature controlled
platform19, three weeks (G361 and MeWo) or four weeks (A375 and A375P) post injection.
For the doxycycline induction experiment, upon detection of lung metastasis following tail
vein implantation, PGC1α expression was induced by feeding mice with chow or
doxycycline-containing diet (200 g/kg, Harlan Laboratories) for one week. For the
orthotopic metastasis model, 1 × 106 cells were injected subcutaneously into one side of the
6-week-old male NOD/SCID mouse, with two injections per animal, followed by surgical
tumor removal when the subcutaneous tumors reached the size of 2 mm in diameter.
Metastasis was monitored by in vivo imaging at 8–10 weeks post surgery. After the
measurement of bioluminescence, animals were sacrificed and the lungs were harvested.
Collected lung tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution (Sigma-Aldrich)
overnight. Fixed tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or antibodies
against p-FAK-Y397 (Invitrogen) or HMB45 (Abcam), and one image per sample was

In vitro migration and invasion assays—For cell migration assays, transwell
chambers were purchased from Corning Life Science. Generally, A375P (5×103) or G361
(4×103) cells in 0.1 mL of FBS-free medium were seeded into the upper chamber and
incubated for 6 h if not otherwise indicated. For invasion assays, A375P (5×103), A375
(3×103), G361 (4×103), A2058 (3×103), RPMI7951 (5×103) or WM115 (4×103) cells in 0.1
mL of FBS-free medium were seeded into the upper chamber of an 8 μM matrigel coated
chamber (BD Bioscience) and incubated for 16 h if not otherwise indicated. Specifically, for
the migration and invasion assays on sorted cells (Fig. 2c) or A375P cells with ID2
knockdown (Fig. 3b), 1×105 cells were seeded and incubated for 24 h. Cells that had
migrated and invaded through the matrigel were then fixed and stained with H&E if not
otherwise indicated. The membrane attached with migrated and invaded cells was placed on
a glass slide and total cell numbers from three or four random fields under 20–40X
magnifications were quantified with an Olympus IX51 or a Nikon 80i Upright microscope,
by counting cells on 20–50% of one field area and extrapolated to 100% of the field17.
Specifically, for the experiments with FAK inhibitor, shScr or shPGC1α stably expressing
cells (A375P 1×105/well, G361 2.5×104/well) were cultured in transwell chambers with
either DMSO or indicated concentration of PF-573228, followed by staining with Crystal
Violet and quantification after migration for 24 h. For the experiments with PLX4032, cells
were incubated with DMSO or 1 μM PLX4032 for 10 h in matrigel-coated transwell
chambers, followed by quantification.

Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays—Nuclear
lysates were incubated with specific antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by precipitation
with protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) at 4°C for 2 h. For Figure 3h, nuclear lysates from
V5-ID2 stably-expressing A375P cells were subjected to co-IP with 1 μg ID2 antibody
(C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by Western blot with TCF4 (M03, Abnova) and
ID2 (4E12G5, Thermo Scientific); for Figure 4d, 10 mg of nuclear lysates from A375P cells
treated with DMSO or 1 μM PLX4032 for 16 h were subjected to co-IP with 4 μg ID2
antibody (C-20). ChIP was performed with the MilliPore ChIP Kit with slight modification.
Following sonication, nuclear lysates were precleared with protein A/GDynabeads
(Invirogen) for 1 h. Equal amounts of precleared lysates were incubated with IgG or gene
specific antibodies (PGC1α 4C1.C from Millipore, or PGC1α H-300, and TCF4 K-15 from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight, followed by precipitation with protein A/GDynabeads for 2 h. qPCR with SYBR Green was performed to quantify the promoter
occupancy. For Figure 4e, A375P cells stably expressing V5-TCF4 were cultured with
PLX4032 at 5 μM for 16 hours and followed by ChIP and qPCR.
Cell growth and survival assays—ToxiLight™ Non-destructive Cytotoxicity BioAssay
Kit (Lonza) was used to quantify the cytotoxic effects of indicated compounds according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. The measurement of dead cells in DMSO group was set as 1,
and was used to normalize other treatment groups (Extended Data Figure 2j). For the cell

cell counting with hemocytometer. For detachment culture conditions, cells were plated on
tissue culture plates coated with poly-2-hydroxy methacrylate (poly-HEMA).
Statistics—All statistics are described in figure legends. In general, for two experimental
comparisons, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used unless otherwise indicated. For
multiple comparisons, one-way ANOVAs were applied. When cells were used for
experiments, three replicates per treatment were chosen as an initial sample size. All n
values defined in the legends refer to biological replicates. If technical failures such as tailvein injection failure or inadequate intraperitoneal injection occurred before collection, those
samples were excluded from the final analysis. Statistical significance is represented by
asterisks corresponding to *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.005.

depletion-mediated activation of integrin, TGFβ and Wnt pathways (d) and induction of
invasion (e) and metastasis (f, n=9 mice/group). g, TCF4 is required for the induction of
integrins by ID2 inhibition. h, ID2 interacts with TCF4 in A375P cells. i–j, Ectopic
expression of TCF4 increases integrin mRNAs (i) through directly binding to promoters of
integrin genes (j) in A375P cells. k–l, TCF4 depletion represses invasion (k) and metastasis
(l, n=8 mice/group) induced by PGC1α or ID2 knockdown in A375P cells. Images in b, c, e,
f and k represent one picture captured with scale bar representing 200 microns; specifically,
scale bars in b, A375P invasion, represent 100 microns. Values in a, d, g, i, j and k represent
mean ± SD of independent biological triplicates representative of three experiments; values
in c, f and l represent mean ± SEM of indicated amount of mice; in a, c, d, f, g, i, j, k and l,
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.005 by Student’s t-test.

Figure 4. BRAFV600E inhibitor, PLX4032, inhibits melanoma metastasis by suppressing integrin
signaling through PGC1α and ID2

Author Manuscript

a–c, Inhibitors of BRAFV600E (PLX4032) and MEK1/2 (PD98059 or AZD6244) increase
PGC1α and ID2 expression (a, b) and repress integrin expression and signaling (b, c). Cells
were treated with indicated concentration of inhibitors for 6 h (a, b) or 24 h (c). d–e,
PLX4032 increases the interaction between ID2 and TCF4 (d) and decreases the occupancy
of TCF4 at the promoters of integrin genes (e). f–g, PGC1α and ID2 are required for
PLX4032-mediated inhibition of invasion and metastasis. For in vitro assays (f), A375 cells
were incubated with 1 μM PLX4032 for 10 h, and images represent one picture captured per
membrane with scale bar representing 200 microns. For in vivo assays (g, n=5 mice/group),
PLX4032 (1 mg/kg, i.p. daily) was given for one week following cell implantation, and
metastasis was analyzed three weeks post-treatment. One representative mouse image for
each group is shown. h. Melanoma cells are heterogeneous, containing PGC1α-high and low subpopulations. Values in a, b, e and f represent mean ± SD of independent biological
triplicates; values in g represent mean ± SD of indicated amount of mice; *p < 0.05 and **p
< 0.01 by Student’s t-test in a, b, e, f and g.
