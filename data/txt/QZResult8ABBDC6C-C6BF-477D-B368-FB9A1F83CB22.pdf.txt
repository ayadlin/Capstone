ABSTRACT
Viruses have been shown to be equipped with regulatory RNAs to evade host
defense system. It has long been known that rabies virus (RABV) transcribes a small
regulatory RNA, leader RNA (leRNA), which mediates the transition from viral RNA
transcription to replication. However, the detailed molecular mechanism remains
enigmatic. In the present study, we determined the genetic architecture of RABV
leRNA and demonstrated its inhibitory effect on replication of wild-type rabies,
DRV-AH08. The RNA immunoprecipitation results suggest that leRNA inhibits RABV
replication via interfering the binding of RABV nucleoprotein with genomic RNA.
Furthermore, we identified heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (Hsc70) as a leRNA host
cellular interacting protein, of which the expression level was dynamically regulated
by RABV infection. Notably, our data suggest that Hsc70 was involved in suppressing
RABV replication by leader RNA. Finally, our experiments imply that leRNA might be
potentially useful as a novel drug in rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Together, this
study suggested leRNA in concert with its host interacting protein Hsc70, dynamically
down-regulate RABV replication.

INTRODUCTION

modification, transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional regulation through diverse mechanisms,
such as regulating chromatin structure, modulating RNA
maturation and transport as well as controlling protein
synthesis [2–6]. Although the role of eukaryotic ncRNA
has been well documented, little is known about the
molecular function of viral ncRNA. Viral ncRNA has been
mostly studied in DNA viruses, especially herpesviruses
[2, 7]. Several positive-strand RNA viruses, such as human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Dengue virus (DENV)
and West Nile virus (WNV) can also encode microRNAlike ncRNAs to regulate virus replication [8–11]. Although

During the last two decades, tremendous evidence
has unveiled regulatory non-coding RNA (ncRNA)
as a leading actor in the RNA world throughout nearly
all organisms ranging from viruses to humans [1]. In
eukaryotes, regulatory ncRNAs can be divided into two
classes: one is small ncRNA consisting of short interfering
RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and PIWI-interacting
RNA (piRNA), the other is long ncRNAs (lncRNA) which
is poorly conserved [2]. These ncRNAs participate in
most of the major cellular processes including chromatin

negative-strand RNA viruses don’t produce viral miRNAs,
it generates a small ncRNAs termed viral leader RNAs
(leRNAs). In this scenario, inﬂuenza virus, vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus (RABV) produce
high levels of leRNAs with different length, which play
important regulatory roles in virus life cycle [12].
LeRNA has been discovered in RABV for more than
30 years, but its function and the underlying mechanism are
still poorly understood [13–16]. RABV is made up of singlestranded, negative-sense, nonsegmented RNA genome and
five structure proteins [17, 18]. LeRNA is the first viral
product produced in RABV infected cells during infection.
Moreover, leRNA is also observed in other members of the
Rhabdoviridae family including VSV [19]. Various lengths
of RABV leRNA have been reported, mostly found to be 56
nt or 58 nt [13]. LeRNAs of RABV are capable of activating
dendritic cells (DCs) and its level determines the status of
DCs activation [20]. Previous research has proposed that
VSV leRNA and VSV nucleoprotein (N) complex play an
important role in the transition from viral RNA transcription
to replication [21]. Similarly, leRNA and RABV N could
also regulate viral RNA transcription and replication [22].
When small RNA performs its function, it often recruits
an interacting protein and forms a RNA-protein complex.
siRNAs and miRNAs often need to form RNA-induced
silencing complexes (RISCs) to fulfil their functions [23]. A
member of Argonaute (Ago) family proteins located in the
heart of RISC has an important function on target cleavage,
and can cleave pre-miRNA to mature miRNA [24, 25]. It has
been reported that RABV N protein preferentially interacts
with leRNA over other RNA species [26]. La protein is
another well-known protein interacting with RABV leRNA
[13]. It is also associated with VSV leRNA and norovirus
viral RNA [27, 28]. Moreover, in eukaryotic cells, La protein
associates with the 3′ terminus of many newly synthesized
small RNAs to protect them from exonucleases [29]. Thus,
the important role of the interaction between La protein
and leRNA deserves further investigation [13]. Although
RABV leRNA is a well-known ncRNA transcript of RABV
genome and plays important roles in viral transcription
and replication, the underlying mechanism remains
to be elucidated.
The aim of this study is to investigate the in vitro
and in vivo function of leRNA on RABV replication of
DRV-AH08, a wild type RABV strain, and the detailed
molecular mechanisms. To this end, we applied aptamer
mediated RNA-protein precipitation assay coupled with
mass spectrometric analysis and identified a host cell
interacting protein of leRNA, Hsc70. This protein has
been shown to bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the
3′-untranslated region of speciﬁc mRNAs to enhance their
stability [30] and displays important functions on cellular
protein degradation [31], autophagy [32], synaptic
signal transduction [33], and notably, loading small
RNA duplexes into Argonaute proteins [34]. Through
biochemical assay, real time PCR, immunohistochemical
staining and in vivo experiments, we showed that leRNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulates RABV replication via interacting with Hsc70
and knockdown of the Hsc70 resulted in the suppression
of RABV replication. In addition, our in vitro and in vivo
experiments implied that leRNA might be potentially
useful as a novel drug in rabies post-exposure prophylaxis.

RESULTS
Architecture of leRNA from RABV DRV-AH08
strain
To determine the precise sequence and length of
leRNA, the total RNAs were extracted from mouse brain
infected with RABV DRV-AH08 strain, a wild-type RABV.
The RNA was subjected to sequencing of the 3′ and 5′
ends of leRNA. Firstly, the total RNAs were added with
Poly(A) tail through Poly(A) Polymerase and reversely
transcribed by RT primers containing adapter 1 before oligo
d(T) (Figure 1A). Then the cDNA was amplified by primer
adapter 1 and primer complementary to the 3′ terminus of
the virus genome, to obtain dsDNA, which was inserted into
pMD-18T vector to construct the 3′ end library. Sequencing
of 30 clones indicate that the transcription of leRNA is ended
at multiple sites, resulting in different length from 40 nt to 79
nt, among which 64 nt seems to be the most abundant (40%)
(Figure 1A). The length of remaining leRNA varies from 56
nt (17%), 58 nt (10%) and many other sizes.
To further validate the length of leRNA, total RNA
was extracted from DRV-AH08-infected SK-N-SH cells
at 12 h post-infection, and ligated an adaptor named 3′ SR
to the 3′ end of the total RNA. Specific reverse transcript
primer complementary with 3′ SR was used for reverse
transcription. After PCR amplification by Illumina
sequence primer, the DNA fragments were subjected to
high throughput sequencing (Figure 1B). Analysis of the
results from the high-throughput sequencing revealed that
64 nt long RNA is one of the most prominent variants.
Similarly, for the 5′ end library, cDNA of leRNA
was ligated with adapter 2 containing NNNN overhang
to match the 3′ terminal of the cDNA (Figure 1C), then
amplified and cloned into pMD-18T vector for sequencing.
A total of 30 clones were sequenced and found to have the
same transcriptional start site of the leRNA from the first
base of the 3′ end of virus genome (Figure 1C). It means
that different lengths of leRNA are all transcribed from the
first base of the 3′ end of virus genome.
Despite the various sizes of these leRNA species,
the putative secondary structures predicted by RNAfold
webserver (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi)
show a typical hairpin structure for the 56 nt, 58 nt and
64 nt leRNA from DRV-AH08 (Figure 1D).

BbsI sites and overexpressed under U6 promoter with red
fluorescence protein mCherry as an indicator. The sequential
TTTTT is the terminator of U6 promoter (Figure 2A).
As shown in Figure 2B and 2C, all of the leRNA (red)
significantly reduced the number of virus positive cells
(green) as compared with that of the scrambled RNA 24 h
post-infection with DRV-AH08 at a MOI of 0.01. To
further confirm the inhibitory function of leRNA, in vitro
synthesized 64 nt leRNA was directly transfected into SKN-SH cells and then infected with DRV-AH08 at a MOI

of 0.01. Similarly, significantly fewer virus positive cells
were observed in cells transfected with leRNA than in those
with scrambled RNA (Figure 2D and 2E). After increasing
the virus dose to a MOI of 0.1, the amount of RABV
positive cells was still significantly reduced in SK-N-SH
cells transfected with small RNA-expressing plasmids
(Figure 2F and 2G), or with in vitro transcribed leRNA
(Figure 2H and 2I) than with scrambled RNA.
To determine if the leRNA has the same inhibitory
function in vivo, more than six mice were simultaneously
injected with rAAV-U6-leRNA AAV virus and rAAV-U6-

RNA with hairpin structure, of which the sequence was
described in material and methods) in the left and right
hippocampus, respectively, followed by challenge with
DRV-AH08. The injection of AAV viruses expressing
leRNA or control RNA were indicated by the mCherry
fluorescence in the hippocampus (Figure 2J). In the left
hippocampus injected with leRNA-AAV virus, RABV
(green) was remarkably less than that in the right
hippocampus injected with the control RNA-AAV virus.
Taken together, leRNA could negatively regulate RABV
DRV-AH08 infection both in vitro and in vivo.

electrophoresis and silver staining, the captured proteins
presented in tRSA-leRNA group (red arrow) but not in
tRSA control group were subjected to mass spectrometry
(Figure 4B). By this approach, Hsc70 was identified as one
of the leRNA-interacting proteins in the host (Figure 4C)
(Two independent Hsc70 Peptides were identified.
NQVAMNPTNTVFDAK and TLSSSTRASIEIDSLYEGV
DFYTSITR). In order to confirm the interaction of Hsc70
with RABV leRNA, we analysed the mobility shifting of
purified leRNAs in the presence of Hsc70 or irrelevant
control protein 4BOW (an irrelevant control protein from
Zobellia galactanivorans) by EMSA assay. With gradually
increasing the amount of Hsc70 from 4 pmol, the shift of
leRNA is clearly restrained to loading slot whereas the
mobility of leRNA was not affected by 4BOW even in high
concentrations (Figure 4E). We also verified the interaction
of scrambled RNA with Hsc70 by EMSA and found that
Hsc70 scarcely binds to scrambled RNA (Figure 4E). To
further understand the details of the Hsc70 and leRNA
interaction, the 3D structure of Hsc70 nucleotide docking
was modelled with leRNA. The 3D structure of Hsc70
(PDB 3hsc) was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB)
[36, 37] and the predicted 3D structure of leRNA by RNA
Composer web server [38]. The putative RNA structure and
the protein Hsc70 structure were then docked to generate
RNA-protein complex decoys by 3dRPC [39] with default
parameters. As shown in Figure 4D, leRNA interacts with
Hsc70 nucleotide-binding pocket located at the N-terminal
nucleotide binding domain (NBD) through its sequence
from site 51 nt to site 59 nt.

LeRNA inhibits RABV replication by interfering
the binding of RABV nucleoprotein with
genomic RNA
The decrease of RABV infection by leRNA could be
due to the inhibition of RABV replication in the host cells.
To test this hypothesis, the level of virus genomic RNA
(vRNA) was measured in SK-N-SH cells infected with
DRV-AH08 12 h and 30 h post-infection in the presence
of rAAV-U6-leRNA AAV virus or rAAV-U6-control
RNA AAV virus. The level of vRNA was significantly
decreased by leRNA overexpression as compared with
that by control RNA (40%) at 12 h (Figure 3A) and 30 h
(Supplementary Figure 1) post-infection, indicating that
leRNA inhibits RABV replication.
As it has been shown that RABV N protein binds
preferentially to the leRNA than the genomic RNA [26],
we investigated whether leRNA inhibits virus replication
by interfering with the interaction between the N protein
and the genomic RNA. To this end, N protein with Fc tag,
P protein and DRV-AH08 genomic fragment (1-1514 bp)
were co-expressed with the leRNA or control RNA in HEK293T cells. The protein-RNA pull down assay showed that
the precipitated genomic RNA by N protein is significantly
reduced (by 40%) in leRNA overexpression group,
compared with that in the control RNA group (Figure 3C).
Meanwhile, the total N protein (Figure 3D) and genomic
RNA (Figure 3E) were equivalent between the leRNA
group and the control RNA group. These data suggest that
leRNA may compete with genomic RNA to bind with N
protein and thus inhibits RABV replication (Figure 3B).

Knockdown of host Hsc70 up-regulates leRNA
level and inhibits RABV replication
To investigate the function of Hsc70 on leRNA
and RABV replication, the expression of Hsc70 RNA
was knocked down through RNA interference and the
leRNA level was analyzed in SK-N-SH cells infected by
DRV-AH08 12 h post-infection. As shown in Figure 5A,
the expression level of Hsc70 was largely decreased
by shHsc70 but not by shGFP, resulting in a significant
increase in the level of leRNA (Figure 5B). Moreover, viral
titer was significantly reduced at 24 and 36 h post-infection
when Hsc70 RNA was knocked down (Figure 5C). These
data show the influence of Hsc70 on the level of leRNA
and RABV replication. To test whether RABV infection
could regulate Hsc70 in turn, Real Time PCR was
performed to detect Hsc70 RNA level after DRV-AH08
infection. Infection of DRV-AH08 resulted in about 50%
reduction of host Hsc70 RNA level at 2 h post-infection,
but a significant increase at 36 h post-infection versus
uninfected control (Figure 5D), suggesting a dynamic
regulation of Hsc70 at different stages during RABV
infection. Notably, we demonstrated that the GAPDH
expression level was not effected by RABV infection
(Supplementary Figure 2).

LeRNA interacts with host protein Hsc70
As leRNA plays a crucial role in down-regulating
RABV replication, we next investigated if any host
factor binds to RABV leRNA. To this end, tRSA aptamer
(tRNA scaffold to a Streptavidin aptamer) [35] mediated
RNA-protein precipitation assay was performed to screen
proteins from the host that could bind to leRNA. Firstly,
the in vitro transcribed tRSA-leRNA was mixed with
SA beads (Streptavidin beads), followed by incubation
with mouse brain lysates (Figure 4A). After SDS–PAGE

monoclonal anti-P antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 IgG (green).  All of the scale bars are 200 μm. All experiments were repeated at least three
times. Data are presented by mean ± SEM. P values were determined by Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.

Hsc70 plays important role in the positive
regulation of RABV replication by leRNA

fewer virus positive cells were observed in leRNA-treated
cells as compared with the control RNA-treated cells
(Figure 7A). The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of
RABV in leRNA- treated cells was significantly decreased
compared with that of the control RNA-treated cells
(Figure 7B). Importantly, VSV genome replication did
not display significant difference from cells treated with
RABV leRNA or control RNA (Figure 7C and 7D). Thus,
leRNA can specifically and effectively inhibit RABV
replication post-infection. To determine if leRNA can be
used to inhibit RABV replication post-exposure in vivo,
mice were challenged intramuscularly with a lethal dose of
DRV-AH08 (104FFU per mouse), followed by rAAV-U6leRNA AAV virus or rAAV-U6-control RNA AAV virus
injection in the same site 1 h post-exposure respectively.
The clinical signs and death were monitored for 25 days.
As shown in Figure 7E, all mice injected with control
RNA AAV virus were dead by 13 day post infection. In
contrast, 30% of mice injected with leRNA AAV virus
survived for more than 25 days, indicating the protective
effect of leRNA in vivo. Taken together, leRNA could
inhibit DRV-AH08 replication post-infection both in vitro
and in vivo, implying a potential application of leRNA in
rabies post-exposure prophylaxis.

As the expression of host Hsc70 changes
dynamically during RABV infection, it could potentially
influence the level of leRNA and consequently RABV
replication. We further investigated the expression of
leRNA, Hsc70 and RABV vRNA at different time points
after DRV-AH08 infection. Real Time PCR experiments
revealed that leRNA was detected 2 h post-infection, and
increased rapidly to a maximal level at 12 h then reduced
gradually (Figure 6A), whereas the virus genomic RNA
maintained at a low level in the early stage but increased
from 12 h and rised sharply from 24 h post-infection
(Figure 6B). During DRV-AH08 infection, the Hsc70
level was reduced at the early stage, followed by a steady
increase from 12 h post-infection (Figure 6C). Thus,
there is tight correlation among the expression of host
Hsc70, leRNA and viral genomic RNA. When Hsc70 was
knocked down by shHsc70 in SK-N-SH cells, the level of
leRNA maintained at a constant level from 2–36 h postinfection. Correspondently, the level of viral genomic
RNA was stable during the first 36 h post-infection
(Figure 6D and 6E). Taken together, RABV infection
dynamic changes the level of host Hsc70, which correlates
negatively with leRNA but positively with viral genomic
RNA. Knockdown of Hsc70 demolished the dynamic
changes in the level of leRNA and virus genomic RNA
during the first 36 h post infection, suggesting that Hsc70
may play an important role in the positive regulation of
RABV replication by leRNA.

DISCUSSION
During the endless arms’ race between the host and
the virus, both belligerent parties have equipped ncRNA to
fight with each other. While the role of host ncRNA during
antiviral defense has been well documented, little is known
about the molecular function of viral ncRNA during
infection. It has long been known that negative-strand
RNA viruses, such as VSV and RABV, transcribe a small
RNA from the 3′ end of their genome [13, 40]. Previous
studies have shown that leRNAs transcribed by several
VSV serotypes range from 50 to 53 nt in length [40]. For
RABV, Kurilla MG et al. reported that leRNAs in RABV
infected BHK-21 cells have different lengths, usually
terminating at positions 55 through 58 nt [13]. In addition,
the termination positions at 43 nt and 60 nt have also been
found [13]. In our study, a more precise RACE technique
was used to determine the length of RABV leRNA in

LeRNA could be potentially used in rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis
Considering the inhibitory effect of leRNA on
RABV replication, it is of great necessity to explore the
potential application of leRNA in rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis. To this end, SK-N-SH cells were firstly
infected by DRV-AH08, and then transfected with in vitro
synthesized leRNA or control RNA 1 h post infection.

the brain of mice infected with RABV DRV-AH08
and it was found that the length of leRNA varies from
40 to 79 nt, among which the most frequent size is 64
nt. To further validate the length of leRNA we extracted
the total RNA from DRV-AH08-infected SK-N-SH cells
at the early stage of infection, another method was used
to construct leRNA library and to measure the length of

different leRNA using high-throughput sequencing. Again,
64 nt long RNA was found to be one of the most prominent
variants. These longer leRNA could be due to readthrough
transcripts although the mechanism is not clear at the
moment. The differences in leRNA lengths between the
present and previous studies might be sue to differences in
the methods used for detection. It is also possible, although

unlikely, that different viruses used in these studies could
explain the different results in leRNA length. In previous
studies the predominant leRNA species of 56 or 58 nt was
detected in cells infected with lab-adapted RABV. In the
present study, the predominant 64 nt leRNA was detected
in mice and cells infected with a wild-type RABV. Future
studies are warranted to investigate these differences.
It has been reported that leRNA plays an important
role in regulating RABV replication and transcription
[22]. LeRNA is encapsidated by RABV N protein,
preventing RABV from further initiating genomic RNA
transcription [26]. Here we demonstrated, for the first
time, that leRNA (direct transfection or as delivered by
AAV vectors) can inhibit RABV replication both in cell
culture and in infected animals. All the leRNA species has

similar secondary structures despite of the differences in
lengths and showed similar effects on RABV replication.
Although leRNA can inhibit RABV replication via
activating RIG-I-mediated immune responses, as doublestranded RNA and 5′-triphosphate RNA from viruses can
be recognized in the cytoplasm by RIG-I, RLRs (RIG-I-like
receptors), and Mda-5 [20, 41, 42], the observed inhibitory
effects by leRNA in the present study seem to be more direct.
Over-expression of leRNA not only reduced the total, but
also the encapsidated genomic RNA. It is most likely due to
leRNA-mediated interference of RABV genomic RNA, N
and P ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which are essential
for RABV transcription and replication [18, 43, 44].
As it has been shown that N protein binds preferentially to
leRNA compared to mRNA and non-viral RNA. It would

be conceivable that over-expression of leRNA can override
genomic RNA binding to N protein [26, 45]. The amount
of leRNA was indeed elegantly upregulated, possibly to
avoid virus over-replication which could induce premature
death of the host cells during the early stage. During the late
stage, leRNA was downregulated, which promotes genome
replication. Similar phenomenon (autoregulation of virus
replication) has also been found in other viruses, such as

DENV–vsRNA-5 from DENV, miR-BART2 from EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) [10, 46]. These findings suggest RABV
leRNA plays a pivotal role in regulating virus replication to
avoid over-replication of the virus during the early stage of
infection.
In the present study, a host protein, Hsc70, has been
identified to interact with RABV leRNA. Using tRSA

experiment and EMSA assay, it is demonstrated that
leRNA directly binds to Hsc70. The RNA-Protein complex
modelling suggests that the 51–59 nt of leRNAs are
likely packaged by a positively charged amino acids rich
N-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket (NBD) in Hsc70.
Interestingly, the sequence from 51- 59 nt of leRNA was
an AU rich domain, consistent with previous data showing
that Hsc70 binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) [30]. As
Hsc70, Hsp70 and Hsp60 all belong to Hsp70 family,
Hsp60 and Hsp90 may also interact with RABV leRNA.
Notably, our data demonstrate that Hsc70 is crucial for
the inhibitory effect of leRNA on RABV replication, as
knockdown of Hsc70 enhanced this effect of leRNA. In
this line, the expression of Hsc70 is significantly downregulated during the early stage and gradually upregulated
during the late stage of RABV infection. In reminiscence
of the amount of leRNA during infection, which was
upregulated in early stage and gradually down-regulated
during the late stage. Thus we hypothesize that Hsc70
plays a positive role in RABV replication by downregulating leRNA. Accordingly, when Hsc70 is knocked
down, the amount of leRNA is significantly upregulated
while virus replication decreases. Although Hsc70 and
RABV N interacts with leRNA [26], it is unlikely that N
and Hsc70 compete for leRNA since Hsc70 knock-down
increased N, P gene expression (Supplementary Figure 3)
and suppressed viral replication. It has been shown that
Hsc70/Hsp90 chaperone machinery is required to load
small RNA duplexes into Argonaute proteins [34, 47].
Argonaute 2 (AGO2) is associated with both miRNA and
RNAi pathway, and is able to cleave pre-miRNA to mature
miRNA [25, 46]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that
AGO2 could be used to produce functional miRNA-like
viral small RNA derived from RNA viruses [10]. Thus, it
would be of great interest to further investigate whether
Hsc70 and AGO2 pathway is involved in the cleavage or
degradation of leRNA. Meanwhile Hsp70 (also known as
HSPA1A) has been shown to interact with RABV N protein
and regulate RABV infection [48]. It is conceivable that
Hsc70, Hsp70, N protein and leRNA may form a complex
and modulate RABV replication and transcription.
Since over-expression of leRNA specifically inhibits
RABV replication in vitro and in vivo, the potential
to use leRNA as a novel drug in rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis was determined. Currently a combination
of rabies vaccination and rabies immunoglobulin was
given to people severely exposed to rabies according
to WHO recommendations [49]. However, anti-rabies
immunoglobulins are in short supply and too expensive
[50]. RNA-based biopharmaceuticals are new class of
therapies demonstrating significant growth and potential
for the treatment and prevention of chronic and serious
diseases [51–53]. Compared to immunoglobulins, leRNA
is readily available and inexpensive and thus would
be potentially helpful in assisting rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis. In our study, AAV was applied to transcribe
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

leRNA after exposure with DRV-AH08, which resulted
in reduction of mortality in mice treated with leRNA
than scrambled RNA. Although the success is somewhat
limited considering the slow rate of gene transcription
and expression in vivo by AAV vector, it could be further
optimized by increasing the leRNA at the site of infection
such as direct electroplating leRNA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids construction
The sequence of Hsc70 shRNA (GGTGTGCTT
ATTCAGGTTTATGAAGCTTGATAAACCTGAATAAG
CACACC), shGFP (TTGATGCCGTTCTTCTGCTTGT
CGAAGCTTGGACAAGCAGAAGAACGGCATCAA),
scrambled leader RNA (AGGACTCTATGTATTAGCA
CAAGAACAACTAACTATCAAACGTAAAGACAAG
AGGATCAAACAC) and leRNA (56 nt, 58 nt and 64 nt)
were constructed into pAAV-U6 vector containing U6
promoter and mCherry reporter to obtain pAAV-U6shHsc70, pAAV-U6-shGFP, pAAV-U6-scrambled RNA
and pAAV-U6-leRNA plasmids. The RNA bait was
cloned into pcDNA3-tRSA (general gift from Dr. Ian G.
Macara, University of Virginia School of Medicine, USA)
and then in vitro transcribed to obtain bait RNA which is
used in RNA binding protein pull-down assay. The DRVAH08 N protein with Fc tag and P protein were cloned
into pcDNA-3.1, respectively. The genome fragment
(1–1514 bp) was also cloned into pcDNA-3.1 flanked by
hammerhead ribozyme (HamRz) and hepatitis delta virus
ribozyme (HdvRz) sequence cDNA.

Cell culture
Mouse neuroblastoma (NA) cells and HEK-293T
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) at 37°C
with 5% CO2. Human SK-N-SH cell line was grown in
Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented
with 15% FBS.

Virus production and titration
DRV-AH08 is a wild type rabies virus (RABV)
isolated from a pathogenetic dog in Anhui province,
China [54]. Virus stocks were prepared in 1-day-old
suckling mice as previously described [55]. 96-well plates
were inoculated with serial 10-fold dilutions of the virus.
All titrations were inoculated with 20 000 NA cells/well
and incubated at 37°C for 48 h, which were carried out
in quadruplicate. The cells were fixed with 80% ice-cold
acetone for 30 min, and then were stained using FITCconjugated anti-RABV N monoclonal antibodies (1:120,
Fujirebio) after washing with PBS. Antigen-positive
foci were counted under a fluorescence microscope

(Olympus, Japan). The virus titer was calculated as focusforming units per milliliter (FFU/ml). Adeno-associated
virus (rAAV) was produced in HEK-293T cells by cotransfecting pAAV with Helper plasmids as previously
described [56]. 96-well plates were inoculated with serial
10-fold dilutions of virus. All titrations were inoculated
with 50 000 HEK-293T cells/well and incubated at
37°C for 48 h, which were carried out in quadruplicate.
The infectious titer of rAAV was determined using red
fluorescent protein (mCherry), and each red cell under
fluorescence microscopy represents one IU.

protease inhibitor (Roche) and RNasin (200 U/ml,
Promega) after cooling to room temperature. The mixer
were incubated on a rotation shaker at 4°C for 2–2.5 h.
Total mouse brain lysate was collected by centrifuging at
4°C for 10 min at 16,000 g after grinded in lysis buffer
(RIPA lysis buffer, Beyotime) with protease inhibitor
(Roche) and RNasin (200 U/ml, Promega). The
supernatants were incubated with Yeast RNA (Sigma) and
Egg white avidin (EMD chemicals) to block endogenous
biotinylated proteins and non-speciﬁc RNPs, and were
cleared by centrifuge. Next, the cleared lysates were
incubated with RNA-beads in a new tube on a rotation
shaker at 4°C for 2.5–3 h. The supernatant was discarded
after centrifugation for 2 min at 4°C. After washing with
fresh lysis buffer for 5 times, the captured proteins were
eluted and analyzed by SDS–PAGE with silver staining.
The specific RNA binding protein bands were cut from
the gel and subjected tocommercial mass spectrometry
analysis (Shanghai applied protein technology, China).

Real Time PCR
Total RNA were extracted from cells using TROZIL
(Invitrogen). The cDNA of leRNA and viral genomic
RNA (vRNA) were reversely transcribed by AMV
reverse transcriptase (Takara) and specific primers. For
quantification, 1 μl of cDNA, 5 pM of primers and SYBR®
Select Master Mix kit (Life technologies) were used. For
the quantiﬁcation of leRNA, cDNAs were synthesized with
tagged primer (CCAGATGCTTGGCGTCCTGCTTTA
CAAATGACGCTGTC) with an 18-nucleotide (nt) tag
that was unrelated to RABV. qRT-PCR was performed
using primers leRNA-F (CCAGATGCTTGGCGTCCT)
and leRNA-R (ACGCTTAACAACAAAATC). However,
these primers could also amplify the antigenomic RNA, of
which the level is negligible compared to that of genomic
RNA [57]. For the quantiﬁcation of vRNA, cDNAs were
synthesized with tagged primer (GGAAGCATTTGTC
CCCGATGGAAAAGGGACGTTTGAAAGGA) with
a 19-nucleotide (nt) tag that was unrelated to RABV. qRTPCR was performed using primers vRNA-F (GGAAG
CATTTGTCCCCGAT) and vRNA-R (CAATTCAGCCG
CCTCATA). For normalizing data of leRNA and genomic
RNA level, U6 small nuclear RNA was used, GAPDH was
used to normalize data of Hsc70 expression level.

RNA immunoprecipitation
N protein with Fc tag, P protein and DRV-AH08
genomic fragment (1–1514 bp) (Described above) were
co-expressed with the leRNA or control RNA in HEK293T cells. The cells were harvested by trypsinization
and resuspended in RIPA buffer (with 200 U/ml RNase
inhibitor and protease inhibitor), kept on ice for 20 min
(with frequent mixing). Centrifuged at 4°C, 10000 g for
10 min.Take 100 μlof the supernatant for the detection of
input protein and input RNA. The proteins in supernatant
were treated with protein A/G (a recombinant fusion
protein that combines IgG binding domains of both Protein
A and Protein G) beads (40 μl) (Santa cruz) and incubated
for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. The unbound material
(proteins) was washed- off for 5 times by RIPA buffer.
Isolate N protein coprecipitated RNAs by resuspending
beads in TRIZOL RNA extraction reagent (1 ml). Reverse
transcription of DNase treated RNA to cDNA and analysis
by qRT-PCR.

In vitro synthesis of scrambled RNA and leRNA
The sense and anti-sense scrambled RNA and leRNA
were synthesized from Genescript (China) and cloned
into pcDNA-3-T7 vector after annealing. The plasmids
were linearized by enzyme digestion, and then subjected
to in vitro transcription using AmpliScribeTM T7-FlashTM
Transcription Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies). The in vitro
transcribed RNAs were checked by electrophoresis and
spectrometry, and then stored at –80°C.

Non-coding RNA overexpression
For shRNA, scrambled leader RNA and leRNA,
the sense and anti-sense ssDNA oligonucleotides were
synthesized and inserted into pAAV-U6 after annealing.
The AAV virus rAAV-U6-shRNA and rAAV-U6leRNA were produced in HEK-293T cells as previously
described [56] to express shRNA and leRNA in vitro and
in vivo. Three kinds of control RNAs for leRNA with
hairpin structure but no homologous with the genome of
human, mouse and rabies virus, had been used. One of
the control RNAs (CACATGAAGCAGCACGACTTC
TTGAAGCTTGAAGAAGTCGTGCTGCTTCATGTG)
has been cloned into pAAV-U6 to get pAAV-U6-cotrol
RNA plasmid and rAAV-U6-cotrol RNA AAV virus, one

RNA binding protein pull-down assay
The RNA binding protein pull-down assay was
performed as described [35]. Briefly, 30 μg of in vitro
synthetic RNAs were denatured at 65°C for 5min, and
then applied to 50 μl streptavidin beads (Thermo) in
800  μllysis buffer (RIPA lysis buffer, Beyotime) with

RNA fold webserve was used to build the leRNA
secondary structure. After the sequence of leRNA was
imported to the Webserver, the suggested minimum free
energy RNA secondary structure was returned (http://rna.
tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi).

Statistical analysis

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)

The significant differences of virus titer, protein
expression, RNA levels, and mean fluorescence intensity
were analyzed using Student T-test, one-way or two-way
ANOVA by GraphPad Prism software (version 5.01). The
statistical signiﬁcance of survival rates was determined
by the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
Differences were considered statistically significant
when P < 0.05.

Hsc70 and the control protein 4BOW with 6x His
tag were expressed in prokaryotic expression system and
purified. LeRNA was incubated with Hsc70 and 4BOW
respectively for 30 min at room temperature in binding
buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM
MgCl2, 20 mM DTT, 50% v/v glycerol, 0.5 mg/mL BSA).
Electrophoresis was carried out on 8% w/v polyacrylamide
non-denaturing gel in 0.5 × TG buffer (40 mMTris-base,
2.5 mM glycine). Gels were stained using SYBR® Gold
Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (1:10000, Life technologies).
Scrambled RNA was also incubated with Hsc70 for
30 min at room temperature in binding buffer too.
