Abstract
Tumors are composed of cancer cells but also a larger number of diverse stromal cells in the tumor
microenvironment. Stromal cells provide essential supports to tumor pathophysiology but the distinct characteristics of their signaling networks are not usually considered in developing drugs to target tumors. This
oversight potentially confounds proof-of-concept studies and increases drug development risks. Here, we show in
established murine and human models of breast cancer how differential regulation of Akt by the small GTPase
RhoB in cancer cells or stromal endothelial cells determines their dormancy versus outgrowth when angiogenesis
becomes critical. In cancer cells in vitro or in vivo, RhoB functions as a tumor suppressor that restricts EGF
receptor (EGFR) cell surface occupancy as well as Akt signaling. However, after activation of the angiogenic
switch, RhoB functions as a tumor promoter by sustaining endothelial Akt signaling, growth, and survival of
stromal endothelial cells that mediate tumor neoangiogenesis. Altogether, the positive impact of RhoB on
angiogenesis and progression supercedes its negative impact in cancer cells themselves. Our ﬁndings elucidate
the dominant positive role of RhoB in cancer. More generally, they illustrate how differential gene function effects
on signaling pathways in the tumor stromal component can complicate the challenge of developing therapeutics
to target cancer pathophysiology. Cancer Res; 73(1); 50–61. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Solid tumors are composed of neoplastic epithelial cells that
exist in a microenvironment rich in resident ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, leukocytes, and extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins (1, 2). Both cancer cells and their surrounding
stroma undergo dramatic alterations during the two main
stages of tumor initiation and progression (3, 4). During
initiation, a normal ductal epithelium with a quiescent stroma
enters a hyperproliferative stage, with cells that harbor oncogenic mutations in genes promoting cell growth and survival
(4). Initiation is mostly induced by the intrinsic properties of

the epithelial cells themselves that facilitate transformation.
The transformed cells subsequently progress to form a solid
tumor that may ultimately acquire the ability to invade and
metastasize to distant organs. Unlike initiation, progression is
determined primarily by the surrounding stromal microenvironment. Cancer cells produce a range of growth factors and
proteases that modify the adjacent stroma to form a permissive
and supportive environment for tumor growth known as a
reactive tumor stroma (5). One critical modiﬁcation in the
tumor stroma is the angiogenic switch in which proangiogenic
molecules secreted by tumor cells recruit endothelial cells to
the growing tumor to drive neovascularization. Thus, crosstalk
between tumor cells and their surrounding stromal cells drives
progression. Elucidating the character of the tumor-promoting
signaling pathways that are present in both neoplastic cells and
their stromal compartments is critical to deﬁne valid therapeutic targets, develop effective drugs and understand their
mechanism of action.
RhoB is a member of the family of small GTPases that is
distinguished from other Rho proteins by its subcellular
localization in endosomes, Golgi-associated vesicles and the
nucleus (6–8). In nontumor cells, RhoB controls the subcellular trafﬁcking of important signaling molecules such as
EGF receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and Src between endosomes and other intracellular compartments (9–11). RhoB is also a sensor of
cellular stress and is part of the immediate early response
to EGF, TGF-b and Src activation (12). Thus, RhoB is

RhoB Differentially Modiﬁes Breast Cancer Progression

considered a modiﬁer of growth factor signals that are
associated with cellular stresses coupled to neoplastic transformation (13). Alterations in RhoB expression have been
detected in a number of human cancers. For example, RhoB
expression is reduced signiﬁcantly in invasive and poorly
differentiated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
compared with normal epithelium (14). Similarly, expression
of RhoB in lung and gastric cancers is diminished markedly
compared to nonneoplastic tissues, and, moreover, overexpression of RhoB signiﬁcantly inhibits the proliferation,
migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro (15,
16). Similar ﬁndings have been reported in ovarian adenocarcinomas (17). Cumulatively, these results support the
concept that RhoB functions as a tumor suppressor or
negative modiﬁer gene in cancer (18).
In both tumor cells and stromal endothelial cells, RhoB
function has been linked to the regulation of PI3K/Akt survival
pathways (7, 19). PI3K/Akt signaling is crucial for tumor
progression insofar as numerous genetic lesions have been
discovered in Akt signaling components in human breast
cancers and other solid tumors (20). In stromal endothelial
cells, loss of RhoB decreases Akt phosphorylation and blocks its
nuclear translocation (7). In tumor cells, regulation of the Akt
signaling axis by RhoB controls invasion and migration (21, 22).
However, a fully integrated view of how RhoB acts in vivo in
tumor cells and stromal cells has yet to be developed. In this
study, we show how RhoB differentially regulates the Akt
pathway in neoplastic tumor cells versus stromal endothelial
cells. Strikingly, the stromal effects of RhoB in the tumor
vasculature override the effects of RhoB in tumor cells, such
that the net in vivo effect is a marked reduction in the rate of
tumorigenesis when RhoB is missing, challenging the prevailing view that this gene acts chieﬂy as a suppressor function in
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Transgenic MMTV-PyTþ/ males (Jackson Labs; ref. 23)
were crossed with RhoBþ/ females (12). Resulting double
heterozygotes were crossed to obtain the required genotypes
(MMTV-PyTþ//RhoBþ/þ, MMTV-PyTþ//RhoBþ/, MMTVPyTþ//RhoB/) in females. For mammary gland transplantations, NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice (NOD/SCID; Jackson labs)
were crossed with 129/Sv/RhoB/ mice. Resulting double
heterozygotes were crossed to obtain Prkdcscid;Prkdcscid/
RhoB/or Prkdcscid;Prkdcscid/RhoBþ/ mice, which in turn
were crossed to get Prkdcscid;Prkdcscid/RhoBþ/, Prkdcscid;
Prkdcscid/RhoB/ or Prkdcscid;Prkdcscid/RhoBþ/þ mice. Transplantations were carried out with modiﬁcations of previous
procedures (24). For orthotopic injection of tumor cells into
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice, 3  105 cells
(MMTV-RhoB cells or MDA-MB-231) were embedded in Matrigel Matrix (BD Biosciences) and injected into the inguinal
gland (no. 4). All tumors were measured with a caliper and total
tumor volume was determined using the following formula:
volume ¼ (4/3)(p)(1/2  smaller diameter)2 (1/2  larger
diameter). All studies were conducted in compliance with the
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center or Lankenau Institute

(Boston, MA).
Human cells and shRNA
MDA-MB-231 cells obtained from American Type Culture
Collection and authenticated by this established provider were
cultured for less than 6 months after resuscitation in the
laboratory in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM)
4.5 g/L glucose containing 10% FBS. Proliferation assays were
conducted using the MTT kit according to manufacturer's
instructions (Roche). Migration assays were conducted using a
Transwell assay for 4 hours (Corning). Colony formation in soft
agar was conducted by resuspending 5  104 cells per well in
culture medium containing 0.5% agar and 10% serum, and then
plating onto a bottom layer of 1% agar in 6-well plates. 293T
cells were used for production of short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
purchased from The RNAi Consortium (TRC) at Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA) using recommended procedures (25).
The targeting sequences of these constructs are listed in
Supplementary Table S2.
Mouse primary tumor cells
Primary mouse tumor cells were isolated as described
previously (26). Anchorage-independent cell growth was conducted as described on the nonadhesive substrate polyHEMA
(Sigma; ref. 27). Cell proliferation was assessed using the
BrdUrd assay from Roche. Three-dimensional (3D) morphogenesis assays in growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were conducted as previously described (28, 29).
Mouse primary tumor endothelial cells
Tumors were collected in a petri dish, washed with cold
Hank's balanced salt solution containing antibiotics, ﬁnely
minced and digested in 0.2% Worthington type I collagenase
for 30 minutes at 37 C. Digested tissue was ﬁltered through a
100-micron cell strainer (BD Discovery Labware), centrifuged,
and resuspended in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). The ﬁltrate was incubated with magnetic beads (Invitrogen) conjugated to anti-mouse CD31 antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 15 minutes. The beads were washed vigorously 6 to
8 times in 0.1% BSA/PBS using the MPC magnet (Invitrogen)
and plated on gelatin coated plates in high glucose DMEM
supplemented with 25 mg Endothelial Cell Mitogen (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.), 100 mg/mL heparin, 20% FBS, and
nonessential amino acids. At 80% conﬂuence, cells were
removed and incubated with beads conjugated to anti-mouse
ICAM-2 (BD Pharmingen). Endothelial cell identity was conﬁrmed by DiI-actylated Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) ﬂuorescence (Biomedical Technologies, Inc).
Whole-mount staining
Mammary glands were removed at 5 weeks of development
and spread on a glass slide. After ﬁxation for 4 hours in Carnoy's
solution (10% glacial acetic acid, 30% chloroform, and 60%
EtOH), the glands were rehydrated by washing sequentially in
70%, 50%, and 25% EtOH for 15 minutes each and then in H2O
for 5 minutes. Each gland was stained overnight with carmine

mounted in permamount (Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation
Western blot analysis was conducted using antibodies
against phospho-Akt S473 (Cell signaling), total Akt (Cell
signaling), phospho-EGFR Tyr1068 (Cell signaling), total EGFR
(Cell signaling), and a-tubulin (Calbiochem). For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (150
mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40 and 0.5%
deoxycholic acid, 1 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 200
mmol/L NaF, 50 nmol/L calyculin, and phosphatase/protease
inhibitors). Immunoprecipitations were conducted with
pAktS473 antibody (Cell Signaling) and a 50:50 mix of protein
G and protein A Sepharose (GE), then analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody against Akt1, 2, or 3 (Cell Signaling
Technology).
Immunostaining
Costaining of SMA (Sigma) and CD31 (Pharmingen) were
conducted on 5-micron frozen sections using standard methods. Samples were mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade
mounting media containing 40 , 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Invitrogen). Confocal images were taken using the Zeiss
LSM510 confocal system and quantiﬁed using the Velocity
software (Perkin Elmer).
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization protocol has been previously detailed
(30). Use of human tissue was approved by the Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
Quantitative RT-PCR for gene expression
Tumor was collected in RNAlater solution (Ambion) overnight at 4 C for total RNA extraction using RNeasy Fibrous
Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA were prepared from 0.8 mg
total RNA using random hexaprimers as templates (Applied
Biosystem kit). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
carried out on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). Cycling conditions were conducted as described previously (31). Multiple samples from
independent tumors were run in triplicate. Primers are listed
in Supplementary Table S1. VE-cadherin and glceraldehyde3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used as references for quantiﬁcation of blood vessels RNA fraction and
total RNA, respectively. The multigene transcriptional proﬁling method was used to determine mRNA copies per cell
as described previously (32, 33).
Flow cytometry
Cells (5  105) were dissociated using 5 mmol/L EDTA,
blocked in cold PBS with 3% BSA for 30 minutes, and incubated
with IMC-ME1 antibody at 10 mg/mL for 1 hour on ice. After
washing, cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated
secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) for an additional 1 hour on ice, and then analyzed for IMC-ME1 surface
binding using ﬂow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACSAria
system). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.)

Results
RhoB is elevated in tumor blood vessels but less
frequently expressed in tumor cells
There is considerable evidence that RhoB functions as a
tumor suppressor in cancer cells where its expression correlates inversely with tumor aggressiveness (34). To begin to
evaluate the overall contributions of RhoB during tumorigenesis in vivo, we investigated RhoB expression in tumor cells and
the adjacent stroma of human breast tumor specimens using
RNA in situ hybridization. Among the set of tumor specimens
examined, 6 of 8 contained invasive ductal carcinoma with 2 of
those 6 also containing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). RhoB
expression was detected in tumor cells in 4 of 6 of the invasive
ductal carcinomas and 1 of 2 of the DCIS, whereas expression
was lower in adjacent normal ductal epithelium. RhoB is
expressed in the endothelial vasculature during neoangiogenesis in nonmalignant settings (7), so endothelial cells in
the tumor and adjacent normal tissues were examined. Notably, all the breast tumor specimens showed elevated RhoB
expression in tumor-associated blood vessels, with lower
expression observed in blood vessels from adjacent normal
tissue. Figure 1 shows antisense RNA hybridization images for
adjacent normal tissue (Fig. 1A and B), tumor tissue and
tumor-associated blood vessels (Fig. 1C and D), and sense
RNA probe controls (Fig. 1E and F). These results suggested
that RhoB expression was uniformly increased in tumor blood
vessels. These ﬁndings agreed with a published dataset (35) of
gene expression in 5 invasive ductal carcinoma and 5 invasive
lobular carcinomas, where our bioinformatics analysis indicated that 8 of 10 breast tumor specimens displayed higher
RhoB expression. Overall, it seemed that RhoB expression is
commonly increased in the blood vessels of breast tumors,
suggesting the hypothesis that RhoB may exert a role in the
tumor vasculature that is distinct from its role in tumor cells.
RhoB loss increases tumor initiation and tumor cell
growth
To dissect the functional role of RhoB during breast cancer
development, we used the well-established MMTV-PyT and
MMTV-myc mouse models of spontaneous breast cancer (23).
MMTV-PyT mice were interbred with RhoB null mice and
breast tumorigenesis was evaluated in the backcrossed offspring. An evaluation of whole-mount staining of mammary fat
pads revealed an increase in the number of early tumor lesions
in RhoB/ animals (average of 10 lesions per fat pad) compared with RhoBþ/ animals (average of 0.5 lesions per fat
pad; Fig. 2A (a and b)). We next isolated cells from the arising
tumors and evaluated their growth in vitro. Three-dimensional
growth of RhoB/ tumor cells in Matrigel/collagen revealed
an enhanced growth in acini compared with control RhoBþ/
cells (Fig. 2B (a and b)). Similarly, RhoB/ tumor cells survived
and proliferated under anchorage-independent conditions,
whereas RhoBþ/ cells did not survive or grow in the same
assay (Fig. 2C). The level of cell proliferation in RhoB/ tumor
cell cultures was assessed using BrdUrd analysis (Fig. 2D). The
results indicated a much higher proliferation rate in RhoB/
tumor cells compared with RhoBþ/þ cells. Although both

RhoB/ and RhoBþ/þ tumor cells displayed increased proliferation at 72 hours, compared with 48 hours, RhoB/ tumor
cells displayed higher levels of proliferation at both time points.
Similar ﬁndings were obtained in experiments in human
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells where RhoB expression was
inhibited by shRNA-mediated silencing (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2A). RhoB downregulation elicited a marked phenotypic change in 3D Matrigel cultures such that highly
branched and invasive structures were decreased and replaced
with proliferative foci of tumor cells (Fig. 3A). Notably, this
phenotypic change was associated with decreased invasion of
the Matrigel matrix. In considering these characteristics in
two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, we found that RhoBsilenced cells were less migratory in Transwell assays (Fig.
3B) and more proliferative in MTT assays (Fig. 3C). The
invasive phenotype seen in 3D Matrigel/collagen cell cultures
were difﬁcult to quantify in comparison with the loss-offunction phenotype, due to the differently shaped colonies
observed, so this culture system was used to qualitatively
evaluate the impact of RhoB. To quantify differences in 3D
cell growth, we took advantage of agar 3D cell culture assays
where invasion is inhibited, resulting in cell colonies that were
similarly shaped and more readily compared in size (Fig. 3D (a
and b)). In these cultures, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in
the size of colonies with loss of RhoB.
We further conﬁrmed our ﬁndings using the MMTV-myc
mouse model of breast cancer where expression of c-Myc is
under the control of the MMTV promoter/enhancer (36). Consistent with observations in the MMTV-PyT/RhoB/ mice, loss
of RhoB increased tumor incidence in MMTV-Myc/RhoB/
mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A) such that the occurrence of
tumor-free mice was more common in nullizygous mice (n ¼
34) than control heterozygous mice (n ¼ 27; Supplementary
Fig. S1A). In addition, there was a signiﬁcant difference in
tumor onset in virgin females between MMTV-myc/RhoBþ/
(14.8%, n ¼ 27) and MT-myc/RhoB/ (26.5%, n ¼ 34) mice

plastic lesions in nullizygous virgin female mice (88.9%, n ¼ 9)
was signiﬁcantly greater than heterozygous mice (11.1%, n ¼ 9;
Supplementary Fig. S1C, panels a and b). In vitro, there was
increased growth of acini in 3D cultures that was evident with
nullizygous tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Finally, we
found that MMTV-myc/RhoB/ cells also grew relatively more
aggressively under anchorage-independent conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1E). In summary, our ﬁndings in multiple
mouse and human models supported the conclusion that RhoB
acts primarily as a suppressor function in vivo during the initial
stages of breast tumorigenesis.
RhoB loss enhances Akt signaling in breast tumor cells
In previous work, we showed that RhoB positively regulates
Akt activity and signaling in nontumor endothelial cells (7). Yet
studies in human tumor cells have implicated RhoB as a
suppressor gene that downregulates growth factor-mediated
Akt signaling (37). Here, we sought to determine whether
differential alterations in Akt activity contributed to the
observed tumor suppressor function of RhoB we documented
in our breast cancer models. Increased levels of activated
phospho-Akt isoform (pAkt) were detected in tumor tissues
isolated from RhoB/ mice, compared with control animals
(Fig. 4A). Similarly, in tumor cells isolated from RhoB/
tumors, we observed an increase in basal pAkt compared with
cells isolated from wild-type animals, and this could be further
increased by IGF-1 or EGF stimulation (Fig. 4B). Similar results
were obtained in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells, where shRNAmediated or antisense-mediated knockdown of RhoB expression, respectively, enhanced levels of basal pAkt compared with
control cells (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). To
determine which Akt isoforms contributed to the increased
level of total phosphorylated Akt and to the phenotypes
produced by RhoB deﬁciency in vitro and in vivo, we conducted
an immunoprecipitation analysis of pAkt-S473 followed by
speciﬁc immunoblotting for Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3. In tumor
cells from RhoB/ mice, as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells

transduced with RhoB shRNA, we observed enhanced phosphorylation of S473 in all 3 Akt isoforms (Fig. 4D). In Akt
knockdown experiments, we evaluated their individual contributions to tumor cell phenotypes by using shRNAs designed
to selectively speciﬁcally silence each Akt isoform in RhoBþ/þ
and RhoB/ mouse tumor cells (Supplementary Figs. S4 and
S5). Paralleling the results in MDA-MB-231 cells, we found that
silencing any one of the 3 Akt isoforms was sufﬁcient to
ameliorate the increased growth of RhoB/ acini in 3D
cultures (Fig. 4E and F). Quantiﬁcation of the acini sizes
conﬁrmed an increase in the size of RhoB/ acini (22426.81
Pixel2 vs. 9481.53 Pixel2) and revealed the signiﬁcant reduction
in size sustained after depletion of the Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3
isoforms (8688.84, 12208.94, and 12427.88 pixel2, respectively).
Thus, we concluded that RhoB loss was sufﬁcient to elevate the
levels of phosphorylation in all Akt isoforms, suggesting effects
on a redundant rather than nonredundant function of these
isoforms that contributed to a more aggressive growth
phenotype.

RhoB loss delays breast tumor progression
Having established that RhoB loss promoted the initiation
and early growth of breast tumors, we went on to assess its
effects on tumor angiogenesis and progression after activation
of the angiogenic switch. Strikingly, the greater number of early
lesions in RhoB-deﬁcient mice did not convert at later times to
a greater tumor burden. Speciﬁcally, we found that the appearance of palpable tumors was markedly delayed in MMTV-PyT
and MMTV-myc mice when RhoB was deleted (Fig. 5A and
data not shown). In addition, at the endpoint of the experiment, RhoB-deﬁcient mice displayed small, slow growing
tumors, whereas the tumor burden of RhoB-expressing animals was much larger (Fig. 5B). Because RhoB was deleted in
both the tumor and stromal compartments, we reasoned that
it may exert different competing biologic functions in these
compartments, as hinted by the opposite directions of pAkt
regulation we had observed in tumor cells versus endothelial
cells. Indeed, by establishing that RhoB loss retards angiogenic
sprouting in normal tissues, a previous study had hinted that

tumor neoangiogenesis might also be similarly impaired (7). In
support of this likelihood, tumors stained with CD31 to mark
endothelial cells and a smooth muscle actin (SMA) to mark
pericytes revealed a general deﬁciency in the tumor vascular
network in RhoB/ animals consistent with a defect in
sprouting angiogenesis (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, whole tumor
mRNA analysis revealed signiﬁcantly lower levels of endothelial-speciﬁc VE-cadherin mRNA in RhoB-deﬁcient mice, another indication of fewer endothelial cells in the tumor tissue (Fig.
5D). We isolated endothelial cells from tumors growing in
RhoB / and RhoBþ/þ mice to assess pS473 levels in Akt expressed in tumor endothelial cells (Fig. 5E). As expected, a dosedependent decrease was documented in pAkt that was associated with allelic losses in RhoBþ/þ, RhoBþ/, and RhoB/
tumor endothelial cells. There were no dramatic changes in the
expression of Akt isoforms detected at the RNA level in
endothelial cells taken from RhoB/ mouse lung (Fig. 5F).
In summary, we concluded that a loss of Akt phosphorylation
rather than expression in endothelial cells may contribute to
the angiogenic failure in RhoB-null tumors.
Beneﬁts of RhoB loss to tumor cell growth are
subordinate to angiogenic limitations in the tumor
stromal compartment
Given the differential functions of RhoB seen on tumor cells
in vitro where loss of RhoB increased cell growth contrasted

www.aacrjournals.org

with the slowed overall tumor grown in the RhoB-null MMTVPyT mice, we hypothesized that the impact of RhoB on stromal
functions may be dominant to its tumor cell autonomous
functions. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted reciprocal transplants of tumor and host RhoB genotypes. We
observed consistent results regardless of whether minced
tumor pieces or primary tumor cells grown in culture were
used as orthotopic transplants. We ﬁrst compared the growth
RhoBþ/þ tumor grafted into RhoB nullizygous or heterozygous
hosts. Notably, tumor growth was restricted in nullizygous
hosts, establishing that the RhoB/ stroma was sufﬁcient to
enforce a restriction in tumor growth (Fig. 6A). Speciﬁcally,
there was a delay in the appearance of palpable tumors in
RhoB/ stromal microenvironment leading to a reduction in
overall tumor size at 35 and 50 days after implantation. This
difference diminished by approximately 80 days after implantation, suggesting the imposition of a selection by the microenvironment for the emergence of properties that could overcome the antiangiogenic barrier that the microenvironment
initially enforced (Fig. 6A). A breakdown in the rate of tumor
growth at early time points (0–50 days) versus later time points
(60–80 days) showed that the barrier conferred by the RhoB/
stroma is active against the initial phases of growth rather than
the later stages of progression. Therefore, we interpreted the
delay as one that could trigger the angiogenic switch, as once
the tumor vasculature was established in the RhoB/ hosts,

tumor growth proceeded similarly to that observed in wildtype hosts. Overall, these ﬁndings are consistent with previous
work deﬁning the critical role of RhoB in sprouting, the earliest
and ﬁrst steps in neoangiogenesis (7).
We further addressed this question by conducting a reciprocal experiment in which RhoB/ tumors were grown in
wild-type hosts. In this case, RhoB/ mouse tumor cells and
RhoB-silenced MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells both
exhibited a delay in progression, even in a RhoBþ/þ microenvironment, despite having exhibited enhanced growth in cell
culture (Fig. 6B and C). Thus, it was clear that the effects of
RhoB on tumor growth could not be explained simply by its
cell-autonomous contribution in endothelial cells. Instead, the
results implied that the loss of RhoB in cancer cells conferred a
nonautonomous effect(s) on the stromal compartment that
was sufﬁcient to restrain tumor growth. Indeed, an examination of the vascular bed in these tumors revealed a marked
decrease in CD31 staining, showing a reduction in neoangiogenesis (Fig. 6D). This result was not surprising, because the
secretion of proangiogenic signals by tumor cells is known to
be essential to recruit endothelial cells to the tumor mass and
to vascularize it (4). In assessing the likelihood that RhoB/
tumors may have a deﬁciency in such signals, we documented a
signiﬁcant decrease in the expression of VEGF-A that is pivotal
to tumor neoangiogenesis (Fig. 6E). In proﬁling gene expres-

56

sion in nullizygous and control wild-type breast tumor tissues,
and in cells derived from those tumors, we also documented a
reproducible decrease in expression of PDGF-b and thrombospondin1 (THBS1) and a reproducible increase in stem cell
factor 1 (SCF1), the c-KIT ligand, in cells where RhoB was
deleted (Supplementary Table S3). To evaluate whether
increased Akt activity could explain the downstream gene
expression changes, we also proﬁled gene expression in tumor
cells silenced for Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3. Unlike the general impact
of each Akt isoform on 3D tumor growth, only SCF1 seemed to
be altered by Akt2 silencing in RhoB/ cells. In summary, we
concluded that the delays in tumor progression caused by
RhoB deﬁciency reﬂected both direct and indirect effects on
tumor angiogenesis, involving both Akt-dependent and Aktindependent pathways.
RhoB deﬁciency in breast tumor cells increases
expression of EGFR
RhoB localizes to endosomes and regulates endocytic trafﬁcking of the EGFR (10, 38). A reduction in endocytic removal
of active ligand-receptor complex from the cell surface is the
chief process through which signal transduction by tyrosine
kinase receptors is ampliﬁed (39). For these reasons, we
investigated whether loss of RhoB affected the level of EGFR
on the cell surface in our breast cancer models, as one way to

stimulate Akt signaling. Immunoblot analysis showed an
increased steady-state level of EGFR in mammary tumor cells
isolated from RhoB/ mice that were maintained in full
growth media in 2D cell cultures (Fig. 7A). The enhancement
to EGFR expression occurred at the steady-state protein level,
as we did not see signiﬁcant changes at the mRNA level (Fig.
7B). However, as the immunoblot analysis did not indicate
where the increase in protein levels occurred, we conducted
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to examine
the levels of EGFR expression on the cell surface. We observed
that RhoB loss increased the cell surface expression level of
EGFR in both mouse tumor cells and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
7C and Supplementary Fig. S6). Together, these results indicated that the increased levels of EGFR caused by RhoB
loss were also reﬂected by an increase at the cell surface,
most likely reﬂecting the defect in intracellular trafﬁcking
produced by RhoB loss described previously (10).
To determine whether the increased accumulation of EGFR
on the cell surface contributed to the enhancement of Akt
activation and proliferation rate caused by RhoB loss, we
examined the effects of a ligand blocking antibody (ME1) that

speciﬁcally recognizes murine EGFR. Western blot analysis
showed a higher level of pEGFR-Tyr 1068 in RhoB/ cells (Fig.
7D). Although ME1 addition to cell cultures reduced the level of
pEGFR-Tyr 1068 in both RhoBþ and RhoB/ cells, there was
no effect on the levels of pAkt-S473. Cell proliferation assays
based on BrdUrd incorporation or growth in 3D culture
conﬁrmed that ME1 addition could proportionately reduce
proliferation of both RhoBþ/þ and RhoB/ mouse tumor cells
(Fig. 7E and F). Therefore, while pEGFR elevation could activate Akt signaling and cell proliferation, and RhoB loss could
elevate the levels of pEGFR, it was evident that pEGFR elevation was not the sole mechanism through which RhoB modulated the Akt pathway.

Discussion
The stress-inducible RhoB gene is frequently attenuated in
tumor cells with most studies ﬁnding an association between
its reduced expression and increased tumor aggressiveness
(15–17). The identity of speciﬁc modiﬁers that modulate RhoB
expression during cancer development remain largely

undeﬁned. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the human RhoB
gene has been reported to correlate with poorer outcomes in
lung cancer (40). Transcriptional variations have been linked to
epigenetic modiﬁcations of the promoter, with polymorphisms
in this region implicated in the heterogeneity of RhoB expression in human populations as well as mechanisms for cancerrelated silencing events that impact chemotherapeutic
responses (41–43). Our present study provides new insights
into the functional consequences of such changes in various
well-established models of breast cancer.
Our investigations of early tumor lesions in these models
support previous studies that indicate RhoB attenuation is
sufﬁcient to increase tumor aggressiveness (12). However, the
more expanded scope of our investigations into how RhoB
affects tumor progression challenge the generally held interpretation of a solely cell autonomous function that acts as a
pivotal regulator of overall tumor growth. Indeed, while suppression of cell growth by RhoB was critical during the early
stages of cell transformation in mouse models, we found that
later in progression it exerted a distinct cell nonautonomous
impact on the stromal microenvironment that was dominant
to its cell autonomous impact. This perspective gained from
murine models was conﬁrmed in studies of the highly invasive
and metastatic human MDA-MB-231 breast cells, where we
found that RhoB silencing heightened the proliferative phenotype, in support of studies of RhoB in other types of human
cancer cells (34). Because small-molecule–based therapeutic
interventions necessarily target both tumor and stroma, in the
many types of human tumor cells where RhoB is attenuated,

58

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

the primary beneﬁt of inhibiting its primary Akt effector signals
would be to block stromal activities that are essential to
support angiogenesis. In broader terms, our ﬁndings illustrate
how a putative suppressor function thought to be solely cancer
cell-centric in nature may also be cell nonautonomous and
tumor promoting in nature, as a result of crosstalk with tumor
stromal components that dominate tumor growth, such as the
case with RhoB and its Akt effector pathways in the tumor
vasculature.
Our work deepens the concept that the early response stressactivated protein RhoB is a pivotal modiﬁer of Akt signaling in
cancer pathobiology. In epithelial cancer cells, we learned that
silencing individual Akt isoforms was sufﬁcient to ablate the
proliferative beneﬁts conferred by RhoB loss. Thus, RhoB
seemed to affect the redundant functions rather than nonredundant functions of Akt isoforms, perhaps by affecting regulators common to each. In endothelial stromal cells, we
observed decreased phosphorylated Akt, consistent with earlier results in retinal endothelial cells where loss of RhoB also
reduced levels of Akt activation (7). While we do not yet fully
understand the basis by which RhoB modulates Akt activity,
this work sets a precedent for differential responses to stress
pathways between tumor cells and endothelial cells or other
cell types in tumors.
An additional general implication of our work is it reveals a
fundamental molecular difference in the wiring of signaling
pathways in endothelium and cancer cells, which heretofore
have been generally assumed to be similar in organization and
functional output. This core distinction likely has its roots in

the differential response of the endothelium to metabolic
stresses such as glucose or oxygen deprivation, which promote
growth and angiogenesis in opposition to the cell stasis or
autophagic responses triggered by these conditions in cancer
cells or other nonendothelial cells. This distinction speaks to
the core function of the vasculature in providing access to
nutrients by expansion in times of nutrient deprivation.

In establishing a critical function for RhoB in tumor angiogenesis, our work points to future work in determining how
this small GTPase inﬂuences responses to hypoxia and glucose
deprivation, stresses of central relevance to cancer pathophysiology that other recent studies suggest RhoB may control (44,
45). Our ﬁndings reinforce the concept that genetic validation
of a candidate target in the tumor stroma is critical to monitor,

as effects at this level may dominate the desired effects on
tumor cells and alter interpretations of what constitutes a
suitable therapeutic candidate. In summary, we have shown
that RhoB differentially inﬂuences tumorigenesis in tumor
cells and vascular cells, showing that the latter effects are
dominant in terms of disease pathobiology. The unexpected
differential phenotype of in vivo tumor progression versus in
vitro transformation assays and 3D growth underscores the
importance of exploring gene function in a full in vivo context
that includes the tumor microenvironment, when contemplating therapeutic intervention.
