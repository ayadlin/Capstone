Abstract
Chordomas are tumors that arise at vertebral bodies and the
base of the skull. Although rare in incidence, they are deadly
owing to slow growth and a lack of effective therapeutic
options. In this study, we addressed the need for chordoma
cell systems that can be used to identify therapeutic targets
and empower testing of candidate pharmacologic drugs. Eight
human chordoma cell lines that we established exhibited
cytology, genomics, mRNA, and protein proﬁles that were
characteristic of primary chordomas. Candidate responder
proﬁles were identiﬁed through an immunohistochemical
analysis of a chordoma tissue bank of 43 patients. Genomic,
mRNA, and protein expression analyses conﬁrmed that the

new cell systems were highly representative of chordoma
tissues. Notably, all cells exhibited a loss of CDKN2A and p16,
resulting in universal activation of the CDK4/6 and Rb pathways.
Therefore, we investigated the CDK4/6 pathway and responses to
the CDK4/6–speciﬁc inhibitor palbociclib. In the newly validated
system, palbociclib treatment efﬁciently inhibited tumor cell
growth in vitro and a drug responder versus nonresponder molecular signature was deﬁned on the basis of immunohistochemical
expression of CDK4/6/pRb (S780). Overall, our work offers a
valuable new tool for chordoma studies including the development
of novel biomarkers and molecular targeting strategies. Cancer

Introduction

to 25 years. High-dose radiotherapy is administered for residual
or recurrent disease (5–10). Patients who have metastases and
have inoperable recurrent disease are not amenable for further
radiotherapy. Therefore, there is a strong unmet need for
systemic pharmacologic therapy. Aggressive chemotherapy has
been described to be effective in rare cases of dedifferentiated
chordomas (11). Only limited response is seen by therapy with
alkylating agents (ifosfamid), anthracyclines (doxorubicin),
and cisplatin (12, 13). In the ﬁrst prospective phase II study
with 9-nitrocamptothecin, one patient out of 15 achieved a
partial remission (14). Recently, new targeted therapy options
using erlotinib, cetuximab, geﬁtinib, sunitinib, thalidomide,
and lapatinib have been published (15–18). An activated
platelet-derived growth factor receptor b (PDGFRb) was
described as a basis for therapy with imatinib in patients with
progressive disease (19, 20).
Because of the rareness of this tumor and to only a few well
characterized chordoma cell lines there is limited experience
with preclinical models (21–23). Lately, systematic pharmacologic screening of our ﬁrst published two chordoma cell lines
U-CH1 and U-CH2 has opened new insights for new potential
targets (24).
Meanwhile, we have established and characterized 6 additional
chordoma cell lines. We found that the tumor suppressor p16
(CDKN2A) is deleted and that p16 protein is not expressed in
these cell lines. This deletion has been described in the majority of
chordomas (25–27). The downstream machinery of p16 can be
efﬁciently inhibited by CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib

Chordomas are rare tumors considered to arise from persistent notochordal remnants along in the vertebral bodies (1).
Because of their slow growth, there is no efﬁcient standard
chemotherapy: therapy of choice is surgery followed by radiotherapy. After surgical therapy of this orphan disease chordoma
recurs in up to 50% of patients and metastasizes in up to 40%
(1). Only a minority is cured by surgery, the disease-free
survival is generally short (2–4). The median survival is 6 to
7 years after diagnosis, although the range varies from months

(28). Inhibition of this pathway by palbociclib is a deﬁned
mechanism to reduce the proliferation and growth of neoplastic
cells (29, 30).
Because of the loss of p16 protein in chordoma cell lines, we
investigated the downstream molecules of this pathway in the cell
lines and in tissue comprising chordoma from 43 patients. We
analyzed the effect of palbociclib on the growth of these cell lines
and deﬁned potential responder types.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and establishment of cell lines
The establishment of human chordoma cell lines U-CH1
and U-CH2 was published by us in 2001 and 2010, respectively (31, 32). The new human chordoma cell lines (Nos.:
U-CH3, U-CH6, U-CH7, U-CH10, U-CH11, U-CH12) were all
established from sacrococcygeal chordomas using the same
protocols (31, 32). The cell lines U-CH3, U-CH6, and U-CH7
were derived from patients' tumors from the Royal National
Orthopedic Hospital (Stanmore, Middlesex, United Kingdom), and released from the Stanmore Musculoskeletal Biobank (Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee; reference
09/H0304/78). The cell lines U-CH1, U-CH2, U-CH10,
U-CH11, and U-CH12 were derived from patients' tumors
from the Department of Trauma Surgery and the Department
of General and Visceral Surgery, University of Ulm (Ulm,
Germany). Approval for this procedure was obtained from
the local ethics committee.
As controls for the Western blot analysis, we used the cell lines
SK-LMS-1, CaCo2, and HEK-293; to control the effects of palbociclib on cell proliferation in the MTS cell viability assay, MCF7
and CAL51 cells served as references (Leibniz-Institut DSMZ;
Bochum, Germany; ref. 33).
Comparative genomic hybridization
For comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), the protocol as
described by Lichter and colleagues (1995) was used. Image
acquisition was performed with the image analysis system ISIS
(Meta-Systems).
FISH analysis
FISH was performed according standard protocols using a
commercial available ZytoLight SPEC CDKN2A/CEN9 DUAL
COLOR probe (Vysis/Abbott).
mRNA expression analysis
Analysis was performed according to the standard protocol
(Agilent Technologies) using the Whole Human Genome Microarray (Design ID: 014850).
The generated data were analyzed using the program Genespring12 (protocol: http://www.chem.agilent.com/library/usermanuals/Public/G4140-90040_GeneExpression_OneColor_6.6.
pdf, chip: http://www.genomics.agilent.com/en/Gene-Expression-Human-Genome-Microarrays/Human-Gene-ExpressionMicroarrays/?cid¼AG-PT-131&tabId¼AG-PR-1078).
Western blot analysis
The following antibodies were used: brachyury (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., 1:1,000, Sc-20109), CDK4 (Zytomed Systems, 1:1,000, 603-1840), CDK6 (Abcam, 1:1,000, Ab 54576),
Rb (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:2,000, 9309), pRb (Ser780, Cell

3824 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

Signaling Technology, 1:1,000, 9307), p16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100, Sc-56330), cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP
(Cell Signaling Technology, 1:2,000, 9664 and 5625), b-actin
(Sigma Aldrich, 1:1,000–1:10,000).
Palbociclib
Palbociclib (PD-0332991) is a selective cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) inhibitor for CDK4 and CDK6, and inhibits the
phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). The reagent
was purchased as PD 0332991 isethionate from Sigma-Aldrich
Inc.. Palbociclib was dissolved in water and diluted in 10, 100, and
1,000 nmol/L concentrations as published. For establishment of
the IC50 values, palbociclib was used in concentrations of in 3, 6,
10, 30, 60, 100, 300, 600, and 1,000 nmol/L.
Abemaciclib
Abemaciclib (Ly2835219) is an alternative selective cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 and was
purchased from Sellekchem. Abemaciclib was dissolved in water
and was used in concentrations of 3, 6, 10, 30, 60, 100, 300, 600,
1,000, 10,000 nmol/L.
Flow cytometry (FACS)
Cell lines U-CH1 and U-CH2 were subcultured and treated
with palbociclib (1,000 nmol/L) for 3 days. For cell-cycle
analysis, a protocol with propidium iodide (BD FACSCalibur) and Cell Quest as detection software (BD Biosciences)
were used. All FACS analysis experiments were performed as
triplicates.
Cell counting
An inverse microscope coupled to a digital camera adapter
was used. The pictures were uploaded in the UTHSCSA
Image Tool version 3.0 Final (http://compdent.uthscsa.edu/
dig/itdesc.html). The control and the treated cell lines were
counted in 6 wells for calculation of the median with the SD.
Proliferation assay
The Alamar Blue Assay was used as outlined by the manufacturer using a 96-well plate reader (Spectramax 190).
Single tandem repeat analysis
For a genotyping of the cell lines U-CH1, U-CH2, U-CH3, UCH6, U-CH7, and U-CH12, we performed a single tandem repeat
(STR) analysis using the PowerPlex 16 and Power Plex ESX 17 kit
(Promega). For the cell lines U-CH10 and U-CH11 the GenomeLab Human STR Primer Set Kit (Beckman Coulter) and the
Amplitaq GOLD DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies) was used,
respectively. The analysis was performed according to the manufacturers' handbook.
MTS cell proliferation assay
CellTiter 96Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
from Promega was used to determine the cell viability. Therefore,
the chordoma cell lines as well as MCF7 and CAL51 cell line were
cultivated in 96-well plates and incubated with increasing concentrations of palbociclib (0–1,000 nmol/L) in the medium. MTS
was added after 3 days of incubation at 37 C to the medium and
the absorption was measured at 490 nm using a microtiter plate
reader as described earlier (34).

Chordoma, Cell Lines, Palbociclib, Responder Types

Chordoma tissue bank
Chordoma samples from 43 patients were available from the
Ulm tissue bank (median age: 69 years; range: 17–84 years; 26
male, 17 female). Tumor size varied between 0.5 and 50 cm. Ten
patients had metastatic disease and 21 had recurrences. The
follow-up data are available from 40 patients: 27 are alive (survey
range from 0.5 to 234 months). The diagnosis was based on
histologic subtyping (WHO 2013) and revealed in most instances
a NOS (not otherwise speciﬁed) subtype, including chordomas
with focal chondroid, renal cell cancer like, and hepatoid differentiation (Supplementary Table S3).
Chordoma patient samples were pseudonymized to comply
with the German law for correct usage of archival tissue for clinical
research (35). Approval for this procedure was obtained from the
local ethics committee.
Immunomorphology
Immunohistochemistry were performed on formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections as described (36, 37). The
proportion of chordoma cells showing a positive immunoreactivity were categorized as follows: "no immunoreactivity
detected" (); "immunoreactivity in up to 30%"(þ); immunoreactivity in more than 30% and up to 70%" (þþ) and "immunoreactivity in more than 70%" (þþþ) of the total number of
chordoma cells analyzed (Fig. 4A and B).
The following antibodies were used: polyclonal antibody
against S-100 protein (Dako, 1:1,000, Z0311), monoclonal antibodies against cytokeratin (AE1/AE3, Dako, 1:100, M3515),
epithelial membrane antigen (EMA; E29, Dako, 1:500,
M0613), vimentin (3b4, Dako, 1:300, M7020), brachyury (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100, Sc-20109), CDK4 (Zytomed Systems,
1:100, 603-1840), CDK6 (Abcam, 1:500, Ab 54576), Rb (Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:100, 9309), pRb (Ser780; Cell Signaling
Technology, 1:100, 9307), p16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100,
Sc-56330), Cyclin D1 (SP4, DCS, Cl677C01), and Ki-67 (clone
MIB-1; Dianova, 1:200, M7240).
Statistical analysis
All statistical tests were two-sided ANOVA and P values were
regarded as signiﬁcant if they were lower than 0.05 (GraphPad
Prism software, Version 6).

Results
Characterization of chordoma cell lines
We established 8 stable cell lines using standard protocols
(Table 1, for typical cytology see Supplementary Fig. S2;

refs. 31, 32). All cell lines express the chordoma marker
brachyury (Supplementary Fig. S3). STR analyses were performed of the parental chordomas and the corresponding cell
lines in June 2015; these analyses conﬁrmed the origin of the
cell lines (Supplementary Table S5).
Additional information about these cell lines U-CH1, U-CH2,
U-CH10, and U-CH11 can be requested via the Chordoma
Foundation homepage (http://www.chordomafoundation.org/).
CGH data showed a highly overlapping pattern of recurrent
aberrations and are thus regarded as representative on
the genomic level with recurrent gains on chromosome 7q
(75%) and losses on chromosome 3 (75%), 9p and 10p
(60% each; Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table
S1). By FISH analysis, we found that all cell lines showed
losses of CDKN2A ranging from 50% to 86%, including a
biallelic complete deletion of CDKN2A for U-CH10. Additional FISH analyses revealed that this loss of CDKN2A was
already present in the parental tumor of the chordoma cell
lines in a high percentage of cells analyzed (Supplementary
Table S2).
All cell lines showed high mRNA expression levels of typical
chordomas markers such as brachyury, collagen 2A1, and CD24
(Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C). The expression data sets were
clustered in an unsupervised approach [hierarchical clustering
(nonaveraged) under Euclidean conditions in a centroid linkage
rule] with the data of the NCI-60 panel of cancer cell lines. This is a
public available expression data set from the GEO database of
NCBI. These cell lines have been analyzed using a similar platform
as for the chordoma cell lines. The chordoma cell lines (GEO
accession number: GSE68497) clustered together against the
background of all cell lines.
We further included our own expression data of a nonchordoma cartilaginous cell line (brachyury-negative), which features
cartilage differentiation and from tissue of a vertebral disk. These
data were analyzed with our chordoma cell lines data as well as
expression data from chondrocytes, liposarcomas, and pleomorphic sarcoma cell lines. In this analysis, the chordoma cell lines
cluster together in one group and the cartilaginous cell line and
the sample from the vertebral tissue cluster together with chondrocytes and the sarcoma cell lines; furthermore, the cluster of the
chordoma cell lines intermingle with the data of the GEO expression data and therefore support the cluster analyses (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B).
A list of differentially expressed genes in correlation to the NCI60 panel is available as Supplementary Table S4 (P < 104 and
fold chance more than 10).

Analysis of the CDK4/6/phospho-Rb pathway in chordoma cell
lines
By FISH analyses, all chordoma cell lines and the parental
tumors of the cell lines we found a loss of CDKN2A in a high
percentage of cells (Supplementary Table S2). We conclude that
this ﬁnding in the cell lines is not a secondary ﬁnding due to cell
culture. We therefore focused our analysis on further components
of the CDK4/6 pathway. In mRNA expression analysis, the cellcycle molecules CDK4/6 and Rb are expressed on the mRNA level
(data not shown) while we found a low mRNA expression of
CDKN2A. All analyzed cell lines are p16 protein negative, while
CDK4 and for CDK6 are protein positive (Fig. 1A).
Effect of palbociclib treatment on chordoma cell lines
We assumed that the CDK4/6 pathway is active in the cell lines
and performed cell growth inhibition experiments with palbociclib. The pRb (S780) served as a marker molecule for the cell
growth inhibition experiments.
After incubation of all cell lines with 100 nmol/L and 1,000
nmol/L palbociclib for 3 days, they showed a strong decrease of
pRb (S780) expression with increase of palbociclib concentration
(Fig. 1B). These data are supported by the immunocytological
reactivity of U-CH1 with a reduction of the Ki-67 rating and
reduction of pRb (S780; Supplementary Fig. S6). Prompted by
these results, we investigated the inhibitory effect of palbociclcib
on the growth of the chordoma cell lines in more detail by

analyzing the amount of viable cells after palbociclib treatment
with the MTS assay. Cells were incubated for 3 days with
increasing concentrations (0, 3, 6, 10, 30, 60, 100, 300, 600,
1,000 nmol/L) of palbociclib and the amount of viable cells
was measured. For the analyzed cell lines U-CH2, U-CH3,
U-CH6 and U-CH7, the IC50 value for palbociclib was between
50 and 100 nmol/L (33), U-CH11 responded at higher concentrations (IC50 between 300 and 400 nmol/L). In this test,
MCF7 cells and CAL51 cells served as established positive and
negative control, respectively (38) (Fig. 3).
The inhibitory effect of palbociclib on the chordoma lines was
conﬁrmed by an alternative approach. The effect of a 6-day
treatment with 10, 100, and 1,000 nmol/L palbociclib on the
growth of U-CH1 and U-CH7, U-CH10, and U-CH11 was analyzed by cell counting (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the Alamar Blue assay
conﬁrmed the concentration-dependent growth inhibition after
palbociclib treatment of U-CH2, U-CH3, U-CH6, and U-CH10
(Supplementary Fig. S7). All these lines responded to palbociclib
with an up to 18.5% decreased cell growth. Taken together, our
ﬁndings demonstrate using different methods that palbociclib
inhibits the growth of the 8 chordoma lines, however, the cell
lines showed different sensitivity toward palbociclib regarding
growth inhibition.
The cell lines U-CH1 and U-CH2 were then used to analyze the
cell cycle after treatment with 1,000 nmol/L of palbociclib for 3
days. Figure 2B and C show the increase in the G1 phase and
decrease in S and G2 phase. To rule out increased apoptosis rates,
we analyzed expression of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3.
We could not detect any cleaved PARP or cleaved caspase-3
(Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B), suggesting that in these
chordoma lines palbociclib inhibits cell proliferation rather than
inducing apoptosis.
In addition to palbociclib, we investigated the effects of an
alternative CDK4/6 inhibitor on the growth of the chordoma
cells and treated U-CH1 and U-CH6 cells with the established
compound LY2835219 (abemaciclib; ref. 39). We used these
two chordoma cell lines as these lines represent paradigmatically the chordoma cell lines regarding growth and morphology. The results indicated that treatment of these cells with
LY2835219 also resulted in reduced cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S9). Taken together, the results indicate that two
different pharmacologic inhibitors, which both interfere with
CDK4/6 in cells in vitro, inhibited the growth of the chordoma
cell lines, implicating that this inhibition is due to the block of
the CDK4/6 pathway.
Deﬁning a potential responder versus potential nonresponder
status
The protein expression proﬁles of the cell lines and the samples
obtained from the tissue bank with respect to expression of CDK4,
CDK6, p16, Rb, pRb, Cyclin D1, and Ki-67 index were grouped to
deﬁne potential responders. Basis for this scoring was the response
to palbociclib of the chordoma cell lines (IC50 values and growth
inhibition) as compared with the quantitative Western blot ratio
of pRb (S780)/b-actin and a corresponding expression of pRb in
the chordoma samples. The potential responder type was stratiﬁed into groups (38, 40, 41). Every tumor tissue sample was
assessed for the expression of p16, CDK4, CDK6, Rb, pRb, Cyclin
D1, and Ki-67 index: 66% are negative for p16, 70% are positive
for CDK4, 85% are positive for CDK6, and over 90% are positive
for Rb and pRb (S780). Ki-67 index varied between 1% and 50%

(Fig. 4B and C). On the basis of these results, we deﬁned four types
of chordomas by scoring the expression proﬁles from 0 to 3
(38, 40, 41). The potential nonresponder type (type 0) was
deﬁned by p16 expression in over 10% of the tumor cells. As Rb
and pRb are essential components of this pathway, lack of the
molecules corresponds to a potential nonresponder. The absence
of both CDK4 and CDK6 protein is not compatible with the
function of this pathway and therefore also classiﬁed as a potential nonresponder status. The best assumed responder proﬁle is
characterized by expression of pRb (S780) in more than 70% of
cells (þþþ).
The other categories describe immunoreactivity for pRb(S780)
in increasing percentages of positive cells: 0 ¼ p16 > 10% positive;
Rb or pRb negative; CDK4 and CDK6 negative; 1 ¼ pRb is þ; 2 ¼
pRb is þþ; 3 ¼ pRb is þþþ.
Applying the above categories to our cohort, we identiﬁed 5 of
42 chordoma samples as potential nonresponders (type 0). The
potential responder proﬁles of 41 samples were stratiﬁed as
follows, 10 (type 1), 13 (type 2), and 14 (type 3; Fig. 4A and
B). Furthermore, on correlating the potential responder type
regarding the pRb expression with the Ki-67 index, we found a
signiﬁcant positive correlation (P ¼ 0.0216), i.e., higher proliferating chordomas have a higher pRb expression. For the chordoma cell lines, we found a trend correlating higher expression of
pRb with a higher Ki-67 index (P ¼ 0.08).

Discussion
In the current study we characterized 6 newly generated
chordoma cell lines in direct comparison with two recently
described chordoma lines. All these chordoma cell lines are
negative for p16 protein, most probable due to a loss of

www.aacrjournals.org

CDKN2A in a high percentage of chordoma cells. In contrast,
the downstream molecules CDK4/CDK6 and pRb are expressed
in the cell lines. Inhibition of the chordoma cells leads to a
consistent reduction of growth when inhibited by the speciﬁc
CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib or an alternative CDK4/
CDK6 inhibitor LY2835219 (abemaciclib). We show that in
a cohort of chordoma tissue samples more than 80% of the
patients have a potential responder phenotype characterized by
protein expression of CDK4/6 and pRb.
Chordoma, being an orphan disease, is not treated uniformly
when it comes to chemotherapy. However, due to screening on
large scale by Xia and colleagues (24), there is increasing evidence
that chemotherapy targeting molecules like tyrosine kinases (e.g.,
EGFR; refs. 15, 16, 42) may be an additional therapeutic option.
The ﬁrst xenograft experiments using the chordoma cell line UCH1 showed that the cells preserve the typical cytology and
immunology, thus enabling further analysis of relevant pathways
in situ (22).
The mRNA expression proﬁling of our 8 cell lines revealed high
mRNA levels of typical chordoma markers, including brachyury,
collagen 2A1, and CD24 (32, 43). When compared with the NCI60 cancer cell line panel and other public available mRNA
expression data the chordoma cell lines clustered together conﬁrming the characteristic proﬁle of these tumors.
CDKN2A loss is a common genomic ﬁnding in chordoma (26,
27). We found recurrent losses of CDKN2A in all chordoma cell
lines analyzed in a high percentage of cells. What is more, this
ﬁnding was also present in the analyzed parental tumor, therefore
excluding a secondary in vitro effect. The p16 protein was
completely absent in all our chordoma cell lines.
As the tumor suppressor p16 (CDKN2A) plays a central role in
controlling the activity of CDK4 and CDK6 with respect to the cell

as well as Cal51. Cells were grown in
96-well plates that were incubated for
3 days at 37 C with increasing
concentrations of palbociclib (3, 6, 10,
30, 60, 100, 300, 600, 1,000 nmol/L)

software, Version 6).

division cycle progression (26), a loss of p16 will lead to a tonic
activation of this pathway and thus is correlated negatively with
prognosis, for example, in melanoma (44, 45). In line with this
observation, the transcripts of CDK4 and CDK6 are upregulated on
the mRNA level in the chordoma cell lines, and CDK4 and CDK6
proteins are consistently expressed in all our chordoma cell lines.
The next downstream molecule in the p16 pathway is the Rb
protein, which is phosphorylated by CDK4/6. In Western blot
analysis, all 8 chordoma cell lines expressed the Rb protein.
These cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate the Rb protein
at Serine 780 (33). The cell lines were all positive for pRb serine
780. Taken together, the CDK4/6 pathway is active in all chordomas cell lines tested and shows important defects due to the loss of
the negative regulator p16.
Palbociclib is a speciﬁc inhibitor of CDK4/6; correspondingly, the loss of p16 in lung cancer has been correlated with a
growth inhibitory effect of palbociclib while presence of p16

3828 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

and loss of Rb is correlated with ineffectiveness to inhibition
(40, 46). In this setting, we investigated whether inhibition of
the p16 pathway would result in decreased pRb protein in the
chordoma cell lines. We found that this protein was reduced in
a dose-dependent manner after palbociclib treatment in the
chordoma cell lines. In the inhibition experiments performed
in the current study, the expression levels of pRb directly
correlated with cell proliferation. In these experiments the
IC50 values for four chordoma cell lines were below 100 nmol/L
of palbociclib and thus correspond to IC50 values reported for
various other cancer cell lines (33). We further could show that
an alternative CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor (Ly2835219) has a similar inhibitory effect on the chordoma cell lines. Therefore, two
biochemically distinct inhibitors acting on CDK4/6 inhibited
the growth of the chordoma cell lines, strongly suggesting that
this inhibition is due to blocking the CDK4/6 pathway in these
cells (28).

We argued that growth inhibition of the chordoma cell would
have an effect on the cell cycle as the cascade might directly lead to
a block at the G1 phase checkpoint. We show that this is the case
with a consequent increase of cells in G1 phase and a decrease of

www.aacrjournals.org

cells in S and G2 phase. The sub-G1 phase was only slightly
increased. These effects of palbociclib on the chordoma cells are
not due to increased apoptotic rates as shown by the absence of an
increase of cleaved caspase-3 or cleaved PARP. Therefore, we

conclude that the consequence of palbociclib on the chordoma
cell lines is predominantly a growth inhibitory effect.
To dissect a potential responder phenotype from our tissue
sample, we analyzed our tissue sample for the expression of p16,
CDK4, CDK6, Rb, pRb, and cyclin D1 as compared with the
responding cell lines. By immunohistochemical typing, we stratiﬁed our patients' samples in various groups, leading to the
deﬁnition of potential nonresponders and potential responders
to a treatment with palbociclib. The potential nonresponder
group was deﬁned as p16-positive, and absence of CDK4 or
CDK6 or Rb/pRb. Vice versa, we established a potential responder
phenotype characterized by the absence of p16 protein but
detectable CDK4/CDK6 and pRb (38, 40, 41).
More than 75% of chordoma samples were completely
negative for p16 pointing to a defect of this pathway in more
than two thirds of chordomas analyzed. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for CDK4 and CDK6 in our chordoma tissue
banked samples showed that 56% of patients revealed coexpression of CDK4 and CDK6, while 35% either expressed CDK4
or CDK6, and only 5% were completely negative for these
molecules. In addition, more than 90% of tissue samples were
Rb- and pRb-positive.
Taken together, the analysis of more than 40 chordoma samples led us to a ascribe chordoma patients to potential responder,
who might beneﬁt from a treatment with palbociclib. We show
that a higher Ki-67 index signiﬁcantly correlated with higher pRb
expression. Therefore, these molecules are potential biomarkers
for tissue testing to identify a potential responder versus a potential nonresponder status in chordoma tissue.
There is a number of clinical trials and studies with palbociclib for various kinds of cancer such as squamous cell
carcinoma of head and neck, liver, ovarian, prostate, and breast
cancer in phase II/III, melanoma in phase I–II, gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, mantle cell lymphoma, and a phase II study
for dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which all show favorable
effects on the progression-free survival and only moderate side
effects (29, 41, 47–49). Our data strongly argue for an extension of palbociclib therapy to chordoma patients with a
potential responder phenotype as has been deﬁned by our
analysis. Therefore, the initiation of a prospective study including chordoma patients expressing the deﬁned biomarkers of
the CDK4/6 pathway by immunohistologic proﬁling to deﬁne
a potential responder phenotype, as has been done for sub-

stances like tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has to be considered as a
promising option for future therapy of chordomas in prospective trials.
