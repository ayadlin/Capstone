SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Outbreaks of fatal leukemia-like cancers of marine bivalves throughout the world have led to
massive population loss. The cause of the disease is unknown. We recently identified a
retrotransposon, Steamer, that is highly expressed and amplified to high copy number in neoplastic
cells of soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria). Through analysis of Steamer integration sites,
mitochondrial DNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and polymorphic microsatellite
alleles, we show that the genotypes of neoplastic cells do not match those of the host animal.
Instead, neoplastic cells from dispersed locations in New York, Maine, and Prince Edward Island
(PEI), Canada, all have nearly identical genotypes that differ from those of the host. These results
indicate that the cancer is spreading between animals in the marine environment as a clonal
transmissible cell derived from a single original clam. Our findings suggest that horizontal
transmission of cancer cells is more widespread in nature than previously supposed.

INTRODUCTION
Cancers most often arise as a result of mutations accumulated in somatic cells during the
lifetime of an organism, and constitute a clonal expansion of a transformed cell with a
genotype derived from the host. Tumors are generally not contagious or transmitted to other
individuals, being subject to immune recognition and rejection based on polymorphic
surface proteins, notably the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in vertebrates. Some
tumors are induced by infectious agents such as viruses, and though these agents can be
contagious, each tumor still arises in the infected individual by transformation of somatic

cells. Two cases are known in which a tumor cell itself naturally spreads among individuals
as a contagious cell line. These are the canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) (Murgia
et al., 2006), transmitted by sexual contact, and the Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease
(DFTD) (Pearse and Swift, 2006), transmitted between individuals by bites. In these two
cases, the tumors exhibit a genotype that does not match that of their host. Instead, the tumor
cells found in all the affected animals are a single clone with a unique genotype that reflects
that of its original, primordial host.

Disseminated, or hemic, neoplasia is a leukemia-like cancer occurring in many marine
bivalves, including clams, mussels, cockles, and oysters, and is characterized by
amplification of cells in the hemolymph, the circulatory fluid of molluscs (Barber, 2004).
The disease affects soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) along the east coast of North America
and was first documented in the species in the 1970s (Brown et al., 1978; Muttray et al.,
2012; Yevich and Barszcz, 1978). The neoplastic hemocytes are characterized by distinctive
morphology, new surface antigens, cytoplasmic mislocalization of the p53 tumor suppressor
protein, loss of phagocytic abilities, greatly increased number (Figure 1), and dissemination
of the cells into tissues (Barber, 2004; Miosky et al., 1989; Smolowitz et al., 1989; Walker et
al., 2006; Walker et al., 2009). Most bivalve disseminated neoplasias are aneuploid, with
higher than normal DNA content, and the neoplastic cells of M. arenaria are roughly
tetraploid based on flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, although there is variation
between individuals (Reno et al., 1994). The disease can be transmitted to naïve animals by
experimental transplantation of hemocytes (McLaughlin et al., 1992; Weinberg et al., 1997).
A viral cause has been suspected but no infectious agent has been confirmed (Taraska and
Bottger, 2013; Walker et al., 2009). The disease is ultimately fatal in the majority of affected
clams and is contributing to depletion of the species in many areas along the east coast of
North America (Barber, 2004; Cooper et al., 1982).
The detection of reverse transcriptase activity in neoplastic cells (House et al., 1998)
suggested the possibility of retroelement involvement, and we used high-throughput
sequencing of clam cDNA to identify a previously unknown LTR-retrotransposon in softshell clams, Steamer, whose expression was found to be strongly associated with disease
(Arriagada et al., 2014). In normal clams the genome contains 2–10 endogenous copies of
the retrotransposon Steamer (normalized to a single copy gene), but in neoplastic hemocytes
the Steamer DNA copy number is massively amplified to 150–300 copies. The finding of
several common Steamer integration sites in the neoplastic cells of multiple leukemic
animals prompted further investigation of the genetics of this cancer.

Author Manuscript

Here, we first extend the observation that neoplastic cells contain common Steamer
integration sites that are not present in normal animals or in normal tissues of diseased
animals. These results have two possible explanations: either Steamer retrotransposons
exhibit unprecedented selectivity for specific integration sites in these multiple neoplasms,
or these neoplasms did not arise independently but are descendants from a primordial
leukemic cell carrying these common Steamer integrations, similar to the contagious cancers
observed in dogs and Tasmanian devils. We therefore analyzed mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) sequences and polymorphic microsatellite repeat loci and found that the genotypes
of the neoplastic cells do not match those of their hosts. Furthermore, all neoplastic

genotypes are nearly identical to each other, strongly arguing that soft-shell clam leukemia
across the Atlantic coast is horizontally transmitted as a contagious cancer cell derived from
a single clonal origin.

RESULTS
Common Steamer Integration Sites in Neoplastic Cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Neoplastic cells of leukemic animals have a high copy number of the Steamer
retrotransposon, but this high copy number is not present in normal cells. Analysis of DNA
from different tissues of diseased animals showed that Steamer copy number was low in
solid tissues and highest in hemocytes, though with increases in Steamer copy number in
some solid tissues, probably due to dissemination of neoplastic hemocytes (Figure 2).
Preliminary sequence analysis of a small number of Steamer integration sites showed that
neoplastic DNA contains new integration sites not present in normal clam DNA, and
surprisingly, these new copies were often found at identical locations in different leukemic
animals (Arriagada et al., 2014). We now extended this analysis to leukemic animals from
independent populations in New York, Maine, and Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada.
Steamer integration sites were cloned from multiple leukemic animals by inverse PCR, and
diagnostic primers were designed to amplify each specific integration site. PCR tests using
these primers then allowed us to score for the presence of each insertion in neoplastic and
tissue DNA (Figure 3A). Of 12 integration sites tested, seven were present in neoplastic
DNA samples collected from all geographic locations, four more sites were common to the
Maine and New York neoplasms but not those from Canada, and one site was unique to
neoplasms from Canada (Figure 3B). These cancer-specific integration sites were not found
in any healthy animals and were only weakly detected in tissue DNA from leukemic
animals, likely due to infiltration of the neoplastic cells into normal tissue.
Common mtDNA SNPs in Neoplastic Cells

Author Manuscript

The observation of common integration sites raises the possibility of a clonal origin for all
the tumors. To test the hypothesis that soft-shell clam leukemia is horizontally transmitted
between animals as a clonal transmissible cancer cell, we examined DNA from leukemic
and normal clams for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the sequences of
mitochondrial genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) (Folmer et al., 1994)
and cytochrome b (CYTB) (Table 1, Figure S1). DNA of all healthy animals (n=11) and the
tissue DNA of all the leukemic animals contained a common allele (C685) in the CYTB
gene, while the neoplastic hemocyte DNA of all leukemic animals (n=9) carried a distinctive
SNP (C685T). This observation supports the hypothesis that the neoplastic cells are
transferred between animals as an allograft that contains this unique SNP. Another SNP
(G649A in COI) was identified in the hemocyte DNA of all four leukemic animals from
PEI, but not in those from other locations and not in any of the 27 previously identified M.
arenaria COI alleles (Strasser and Barber, 2009), suggesting that this mutation occurred
during the evolution of the transmissible cells in this population. Additionally, seven low
frequency SNPs were identified in the mitochondrial DNA of normal animals and the tissue
of leukemic animals. In the four informative positions where rare SNPs were detected in
tissue DNA of leukemic animals, the neoplastic hemocyte DNA did not contain that

matching tissue allele but rather contained an allele common to all neoplastic cells (Table 1).
These data indicate that the leukemias did not arise from their hosts, and are consistent with
clonal transmission of the cancer.
Microsatellite Genotypes Confirm Clonal Origin of Clam Leukemia

Author Manuscript

To characterize the genotype of the neoplastic cells in more detail, we analyzed ten
microsatellite loci in nuclear DNA, previously identified as polymorphic in M. arenaria
(Krapal et al., 2012; St-Onge et al., 2013), by PCR. The sizes of these loci were highly
polymorphic among individuals, and in many cases the animals were heterozygous at the
loci, with PCR products of two sizes (Figure 4). In normal animals the alleles present in
hemocyte DNA always matched the alleles in the host tissue DNA. In contrast, in all
leukemic animals the microsatellite genotypes in the neoplastic hemocytes were distinct
from those in the tissue of the host animal. Furthermore, at nearly every locus, the
microsatellite alleles were of the same lengths in the neoplastic hemocytes of all leukemic
animals. That is, the genotypes of all the tumors were nearly identical to each other.

Author Manuscript

Next, fluorescently labeled primers were used to distinguish microsatellite PCR product
sizes with single base resolution. While all normal animals have one allele (homozygous) or
two alleles (heterozygous) for each locus, microsatellite size analysis of the leukemic DNA
revealed up to four separate alleles at some of the loci. Many of the leukemic alleles were
identical between independent neoplasms, but there were some small variations in repeat
size, and several cases of allele loss or gain in some leukemic individuals. The model-based
clustering program STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., 2000) was used to analyze the
microsatellite allele sizes, and regardless of the number of clusters (K) used, the neoplastic
hemocyte genotypes clearly grouped separately from the normal animal genotypes, while
the tissue of the leukemic animals clustered with normal animals (Figure 5A). A NeighborJoining tree based on the genetic distances between individuals (Bruvo et al., 2004; Kamvar
et al., 2014) clearly demonstrated that the neoplastic hemocyte genotypes cluster as a
separate group, distinct from all the normal genotypes and from the genotypes of the host
tissue. Two branches were apparent within the neoplastic lineage, suggesting that the extant
leukemias arose from a common ancestor that diverged into the PEI and USA cancer
subgroups (Figure 5B).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Three data sets (Steamer integration sites, mtDNA SNPs, and microsatellite alleles) show
that the genotypes of the neoplastic cells all differ from the genotype of their host animals,
and are identical or very closely related to each other. We conclude that the individual
leukemias are not derived by independent oncogenic transformation of cells within each host
but instead come from a single genetically unrelated parent. The data strongly argue that
disseminated neoplasia is naturally spreading between animals as a transmissible cancer cell.
Horizontal clonal transmission of cancer has only been observed in two other contagious
cancers of mammals in the wild, the DFTD in Tasmanian devils (Pearse and Swift, 2006)
and CTVT in dogs (Murgia et al., 2006).

It is remarkable that neoplastic cells from clam beds separated by hundreds of miles were
found to be genetically nearly identical or very closely related. The mechanism by which the
soft-shell leukemic cell line could be transferred from animal to animal in the wild is not
clear. In the two previously known cases of natural cancer cell transfer (DFTD and CTVT)
(Murchison, 2008), physical contact is required for transmission of cancer cells to naïve
individuals (through biting or sexual contact, respectively), but adult clams are sessile and
do not normally come in contact with one another. Clams do filter feed, however, raising the
possibility that leukemia engraftment occurs through filtration of seawater contaminated
with neoplastic cells. Each animal can filter several liters of seawater per hour, so very low
concentrations of cells in seawater could be sufficient for transmission. One early study
showed that hemocytes from a leukemic clam could survive in natural seawater conditions
for >6 hours with minimal cell death, suggesting a plausible route for cancer cell
transmission from one clam to another (Sunila and Farley, 1989). Direct surveys of seawater
at the affected clam beds for tumor cells could provide support for this idea. It is currently
unknown how neoplastic cells would be released by leukemic animals. Cells may be shed
naturally during disease, expelled during spawning, or released after physical trauma, during
predation, or at death of the leukemic individual. The stage of development when
transmission might occur in nature is unknown, though experimental transmission of disease
was found to be most efficient with mature animals of intermediate size (Taraska and
Bottger, 2013). It is possible that its transmission has been facilitated or accelerated by
human intervention, as seed stocks have been transplanted between sites along the coast at
several times in recent decades (Beal and Kraus, 2002).

Author Manuscript

The length of time since the original formation of the primordial soft-shell neoplasia is not
yet clear. The disease has been documented in soft-shelled clams since the 1970s (Brown et
al., 1978; Yevich and Barszcz, 1978), and it is likely that all cases derive from the same
clone, suggesting that it may be at least forty years old and possibly much older. Its
appearance must have been sufficiently far in the past to allow for its spread widely along
the North Atlantic coast. Significant divergence was observed in cancer cell subgroups
specific to the USA and Canada clam populations. Several small microsatellite expansions
and deletions and at least one mtDNA SNP appear to have developed separately in the PEI
subgroup of cancer cells. Further analysis of the origin and continued evolution of these
cancer cell lineages may allow for estimation of the time of appearance of the original
leukemia. The two other examples of transmissible tumors are of very different ages: the
dog tumor is thought to have arisen 10,000–13,000 years ago (Murchison et al., 2014), while
the Tasmanian devil tumor is of much more recent origin, perhaps arising only 20–30 years
ago (Murchison, 2008).

Author Manuscript

It is plausible that the Steamer retrotransposon had a role in the development of the
transmissible disseminated neoplasia. Steamer genomic copy number is greatly expanded in
neoplastic cells (from 2–10 copies to 150–300 per haploid genome), and we show that the
majority of the new integrations are common to all tested neoplastic cells and therefore
likely occurred early in the evolution of the cancer. One or more of these common
integration events may have directly caused initial oncogenic mutations, similar to the
LINE1 integration near the c-myc gene in all known cases of CTVT (Katzir et al., 1985;

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 09.

Murgia et al., 2006), but alternatively they may represent passenger mutations that were
fixed in the genome of the leukemia. Some of the integration sites are unique to the PEI or
USA subgroups of neoplastic cells, and these may represent active gain of new copies by
retrotransposition, or loss of copies due to recombination or aneuploidy; these sites are
unlikely to be a cause of the tumor. Further analysis of the genome or the expression profile
of the neoplastic cells in comparison with those of normal hemocytes could provide clues to
the cause of the transformed phenotype.

Author Manuscript

While all the M. arenaria neoplastic cells we have tested were derived from the same cell
lineage, other leukemias may be derived from different clones or by more conventional
mechanisms. Leukemia can be induced in clams by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injection
(Oprandy and Chang, 1983; Taraska and Bottger, 2013) and these cases must arise by de
novo transformation of host cells, and perhaps by induction of Steamer transposition. It has
also been reported that clam leukemia could be transmitted between animals by a filterable
agent (Oprandy et al., 1981; Taraska and Bottger, 2013) but this is controversial
(AboElkhair et al., 2012; McLaughlin et al., 1992).
Transmissible disseminated neoplasias have been reported in other bivalve species,
including other clams, oysters, mussels, and cockles (Barber, 2004), and these diseases may
also be caused by a clonal transmissible cancer cell. A recent report (Vassilenko et al., 2010)
that neoplastic hemocytes in mussels (Mytilus trossulus) on the west coast of North America
share a common set of synonymous SNPs in the p53 gene is consistent with an independent
development of a transmissible clonal cancer in that species.

Flow cytometric analyses of DNA content of disseminated neoplasias in many bivalve
species have identified characteristic ploidy levels—indeed, polyploidy has been used as
diagnostic for disease (Delaporte et al., 2008). In M. arenaria specifically, the observation
of roughly tetraploid DNA content in neoplastic cells (Delaporte et al., 2008; Reno et al.,
1994) is consistent with a clonal contagious cancer and with the observation of up to four
unique microsatellite alleles at a single locus in neoplastic cells. Given the current findings,
previous observations of abnormal ploidy in bivalve disseminated neoplasia suggests that
many of these diseases in other species may represent independent contagious cancer
lineages. For example, mussel disseminated neoplasia has been reported to come in two
types, tetraploid or pentaploid (Moore et al., 1991), consistent with either two independent
cancer lineages or one which has evolved into subgroups with divergent ploidy, although a
more recent study found a wider distribution of aneuploidy between individuals (Vassilenko
and Baldwin, 2014). Multiple abnormal ploidy levels have also been observed in
disseminated neoplasia in cockles (Cerastoderma edule) (da Silva et al., 2005). We are
currently investigating the hypothesis suggested by the current findings that disseminated
neoplasia in other bivalve species represent independent lineages of contagious cancer.
Preliminary mtDNA sequencing of cockles with disseminated neoplasia suggests a cocklederived contagious cancer line (data not shown).
It is possible that the disseminated neoplasia of M. arenaria could transmit to other species,
though there is as of yet no evidence for this. There may be mechanisms by which a host
animal can reject colonization by neoplastic cells of another species. Molluscs are not

known to have a self/nonself recognition system similar to the MHC system of vertebrates,
and their lack of MHC may make them highly susceptible to this form of infectious
malignancy. Indeed, in the cases of CTVT and DFTD, there are unique mechanisms by
which the cancers avoid MHC recognition. In CTVT, expression of MHC I and II are downregulated during active growth of the tumor and their expression leads to immune
recognition and clearance of the tumor in most dogs (Yang et al., 1987). DFTD cells also
down-regulate MHC expression and the low genetic diversity of devils limits the ability of
hosts to recognize DFTD as foreign (Siddle and Kaufman, 2015; Siddle et al., 2013).
Contagious cancer is a serious threat to marine invertebrates, leading to severe mortalities
during outbreaks in soft-shell clams and possibly leading to mass mortalities in many other
species. The disease represents a significant selective pressure and supports the hypothesis
that histocompatibility could have evolved in part due to selective pressure to prevent
malignancy (Murgia et al., 2006), rather than simply being a secondary consequence of
pressure by infectious diseases. Despite the lack of MHC, molluscs and other invertebrates
may employ other self/nonself recognition mechanisms which can combat this type of
disease, perhaps similar to the fusion/histocompatibility (Fu/HC) system of colonial
ascidians, which protects ascidians from stem cell parasitism which can occur when
unrelated individuals fuse (De Tomaso et al., 2005; Voskoboynik et al., 2013). Bivalves may
utilize a histocompatibility system which may be unique to molluscs or evolutionarily
related to Fu/HC or MHC.

Author Manuscript

Natural horizontal transmission of cancer between individuals has been considered a rare
phenomenon, restricted to two exceptional cases in mammals. Our finding of the horizontal
transmission of a clonal clam leukemia extends the phenomenon to the marine environment,
and demonstrates that this mechanism is more widespread in nature than previously
supposed.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Sample Collection

Author Manuscript

Soft-shell clams (M. arenaria) were collected from several locations (Figure 1). Clams from
the Dunk estuary on Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, were collected and diagnosed as
described previously (Arriagada et al., 2014). Clams from Larrabee Cove, Maine, USA
(MELC) were collected by Dr. Brian Beal (University of Maine at Machias) as described
previously, and one additional leukemic clam (ME-HL01) was collected by a commercial
source near St. George, Maine, with the help of Dr. Charles Walker (University of New
Hampshire). Clams from New York (NYTC) were acquired from a commercial market and
collected from the north shore of Long Island, New York, USA near Port Jefferson.
Individual clam IDs reflect the location and the ID number assigned at the time of
collection.
Diagnosis of clams from New York and Maine was conducted by extracting hemolymph
from the pericardial region using a 26 gauge needle. Six to eight drops of hemolymph were
placed in a well of a 96-well plate and left undisturbed at 10° C for one hour before
morphological analysis using phase-contrast microscopy. Normal clam hemocytes attached

leukemic (Figure 1B).

Microsatellite Analysis

Author Manuscript

STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., 2000) was used to determine the population clustering of the
clam tissue and hemocytes DNA. As up to 4 unique alleles were detected in leukemic DNA,
loci were considered to be tetraploid, and clams with lower ploidy were considered to have
missing data for the additional alleles, which are ignored in analysis. Cluster values of K = 1
to 10 were used with an admixture model with a burnin of 50,000 and 50,000 replicates after
burnin. CLUMPAK was used to graphically analyze the major clusters across 10
STRUCTURE runs. Data were also recoded and reanalyzed as binary absent/present alleles
(Rodzen and May, 2002), with nearly identical results (data not shown).
Genetic distance was calculated using Bruvo’s band sharing method assuming infinite
alleles (Bruvo et al., 2004), as it was created specifically for comparisons of individuals with
different ploidy levels, and a Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed (with 100 bootstraps)
using the poppr package for R (Kamvar et al., 2014) and displayed using Figtree. Alternate
analyses using the genome addition and combined genome addition/genome loss models
generated nearly identical results (data not shown). Further details of the microsatellite
analysis can be found in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.

Figure 2. Steamer retrotransposon DNA copy numbers in different clam tissues

Author Manuscript

Quantitative PCR was used to determine the copy number of the Steamer retrotransposon in
genomic DNA from hemocytes and solid tissues of four representative normal (left) and four
leukemic (right) clams. Steamer copy number was quantitated using primers that amplify a
region in the Steamer reverse transcriptase (RT) and was normalized to the single-copy gene
EF1 (Siah et al., 2011). * indicates P < 0.01 for comparisons between neoplastic hemocytes
and each other tissue tested (n = 3 for gills, n = 4 for other tissues), using two-tailed paired
T-test of normalized Steamer copy number.

Figure 3. Clonal Steamer integration sites in neoplastic cells

Author Manuscript

(A) To determine the presence of specific integration sites in different animals, inverse PCR
products were cloned and sequenced from clams from three locations (two integration sites
per animal). For each integration site, a reverse primer was designed to match the flanking
genomic sequence. Diagnostic PCR using a common forward primer in the Steamer LTR
and an integration site specific reverse primer was used to determine the presence of each
specific integration site in hemocyte (H) and tissue (T) DNA as indicated, of normal (N) and
leukemic (L) clams. Sizes of the amplified DNAs were analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis. Amplification of EF1 is shown as a control. Filled triangles mark the
position of migration of the amplicon. An open triangle marks an unexpected PCR product.
This band is due to amplification of a second Steamer integration site present in neoplastic
cells of all populations.

cells from the three locations (out of the 12 sites tested, including 4 sites cloned from PEI

Figure 4. Amplification of microsatellite loci from tissue and hemocyte DNA from normal and
leukemic clams

Author Manuscript

PCR products using primers flanking ten microsatellite loci in hemocyte DNA and tissue
DNA were displayed by electrophoresis on 2.5 % agarose gels and visualized by staining.
Different alleles are determined by the sizes of the amplicons, with one band observed for
animals homozygous at a particular locus, and two or more for heterozygotes and polyploid
neoplastic cells. Each row of gels represents amplification from a single microsatellite locus,
as labelled on the left. Hemocyte DNA is shown for normal and leukemic clams from PEI,
Canada; and both Tissue (T) and Hemocyte (H) DNA is shown for Maine and New York
clams. These data show that the leukemic hemocyte microsatellite alleles are identical to
each other and distinct from their host tissue.
