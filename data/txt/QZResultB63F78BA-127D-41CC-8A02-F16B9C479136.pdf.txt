Abstract
MicroRNAs (miR) show characteristic expression signatures in
various cancers and can profoundly affect cancer cell
behavior. We carried out miR expression profiling of human
glioblastoma specimens versus adjacent brain devoid of
tumor. This revealed several significant alterations, including
a pronounced reduction of miR-128 in tumor samples.
miR-128 expression significantly reduced glioma cell
proliferation in vitro and glioma xenograft growth in vivo.
miR-128 caused a striking decrease in expression of the Bmi-1
oncogene, by direct regulation of the Bmi-1 mRNA
3¶-untranslated region, through a single miR-128 binding site.
In a panel of patient glioblastoma specimens, Bmi-1
expression was significantly up-regulated and miR-128 was
down-regulated compared with normal brain. Bmi-1 functions
in epigenetic silencing of certain genes through epigenetic
chromatin modification. We found that miR-128 expression
caused a decrease in histone methylation (H3K27me3) and
Akt phosphorylation, and up-regulation of p21CIP1 levels,
consistent with Bmi-1 down-regulation. Bmi-1 has also been
shown to promote stem cell self-renewal; therefore, we
investigated the effects of miR-128 overexpression in human
glioma neurosphere cultures, possessing features of glioma
‘‘stem-like’’ cells. This showed that miR-128 specifically
blocked glioma self-renewal consistent with Bmi-1 downregulation. This is the first example of specific regulation by a
miR of a neural stem cell self-renewal factor, implicating miRs
that may normally regulate brain development as important
biological and therapeutic targets against the ‘‘stem cell–like’’
characteristics of glioma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9125–30]

Introduction
Approximately 20,000 new patients are diagnosed in the United
States every year with glioma, and for the most malignant form
(glioblastoma), median survival is approximately 14 months, even
with aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (1). Recent
studies have shown that gliomas retain many features of neuronal
progenitor cells, including the ability to grow as neurospheres in

culture, self-renew, and migrate in the brain (2–4). Profiling studies
have shown that gliomas express many genes known to play
a role in neural progenitor cells (5). These observations have
created novel opportunities for developing therapeutics based on
differentiation or targeting of self-renewal features of glioma (6).
MicroRNAs (miRs) play important roles in diverse biological
processes, including development, differentiation, stem cell maintenance, and cell identity (7). miRs also play a role in cancer by
controlling the expression of certain oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes (8). miR profiling has revealed distinct expression
signatures in various human cancers, including glioma (9). The
functional significance of most of these alterations remains
unclear. In this study, we report that miR-128 is down-regulated
in gliomas, that its expression reduces glioma cell proliferation, and
that Bmi-1 (B lymphoma mouse Moloney leukemia virus insertion
region) is a direct target of miR-128. Bmi-1 is up-regulated in
several cancer types and is a positive regulator of stem cell renewal
(10–12), and studies in transgenic mice revealed a critical role for
Bmi-1 in driving glioma growth (13). Our results show that the
effects of miR-128 on glioma cells are consistent with Bmi-1 downregulation, including a reduction in glioma stem cell self-renewal,
suggesting that miR-128 may be a candidate for the therapeutic
targeting of glioma stem cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. U87MG, U251MG, and U373MG glioma cells were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM
(Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS (Sigma). Primary human glioma OHG02
cells were derived from freshly resected human glioma specimens and
grown as tumor spheres as previously reported (4). Tumors were dissociated
using TrypLE Express (Invitrogen) and cultured in Neurobasal medium
(Invitrogen) with B27 (Invitrogen), human recombinant leukemia inhibitory
factor (10 ng/mL; Chemicon International), basic fibroblast growth factor
(50 ng/mL; PeproTech), epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL; PeproTech),
penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 Ag/mL), and L-glutamine
(2 mmol/L; Invitrogen). OHG02 cells possessed many of the characteristics
that distinguish the glioma initiator or ‘‘stem-like’’ cell subpopulation (data
not shown), including self-renewal, CD133 expression (4), and appropriate
lineage markers (nestin, h-tubulin, and GFAP) when differentiated. When
implanted intracranially in athymic mice, OHG02 cells formed invasive
tumors, with phenotypic characteristics of human glioblastoma (data not
shown). All tumor samples were obtained as approved by the Institutional
Review Board at The Ohio State University. Surgery was performed by
E.A. Chiocca. At the time of surgery, brain adjacent to tumor but
pathologically devoid of gross tumor was also harvested.
Microarray profiling of miRs in glioma. Expression profiling was
performed using total RNA with the human/mouse miR expression array
(V 4.0) and analyzed as described (14). Microarray data were deposited in
the ArrayExpress database according to MIAME recommendations
(accession number E-MEXP-1796).

7500 Real Time PCR System, with human 18S rRNA as an endogenous
control. cDNAs for RT-PCR were synthesized using iScript (Bio-Rad). mRNA
expression analysis was carried out using Power SYBR Green (Applied
Biosystems) with human Bmi-1 and 18S rRNA primers.
Cell studies. Transfection of pre-miR-128 oligo (25–75 nmol/L; Ambion)
and reporter plasmids was done with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
The pri-miR-128-1 lentiviral construct was used for establishing
U251MG, U87MG, and OHG02 cell lines constitutively overexpressing
miR-128-1, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (System Biosciences). Antibodies used were Bmi-1, H3K27me3 (Millipore), h-actin, a-tubulin
(Sigma), p21Waf1/Cip1, total Akt, phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), and phosphorylated Akt (Thr308; Cell Signaling Technology). Horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies to rabbit or mouse IgG were used
(Amersham). Cell viability was measured using Wst1 (Roche). Flow
cytometry was carried out using the FACSCalibur machine (Becton
Dickinson). For luciferase assays, the wild-type or mutated Bmi-1 3¶-UTR
reporter plasmid was cotransfected with pre-miR-128-1 or control into
NIH3T3 cells. Targeting efficiency was determined by measuring luciferase
levels (Promega) in a FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech)
in triplicate.
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical testing was performed using the Ventana Benchmark System
(Ventana Medical Systems). Expression of Bmi-1 was optimized at a 1:500
dilution with the antigen retrieval CC1 for 30 min using the Ultraview
Universal Red system; hematoxylin was the counterstain. Negative controls
included omission of the primary antibody and use of tissues, such as
normal brain, with very low Bmi-1 expression. The protocol for detection of
miRs by in situ hybridization has been previously published (15). The
sequence of the probes (Exiqon) that contained the locked nucleic acid
(LNA)–modified bases with digoxigenin conjugated to the 5¶ end was as
follows: miR-128, AAAGAGACCGGTTCACTGTGA; miR-128scrambled,
CGTATAGGCCCAAGAATTAGG.
Animal studies. U87 cells stably expressing miR-128 or empty vector
controls were implanted s.c. in the flanks of athymic mice (2.5  105/200 AL
Matrigel; BD Biosciences).

Results and Discussion

Vector construction. A DNA fragment containing the hsa-miR-128-1
locus situated at chromosome 2 (2q21.3) plus 300 bp upstream and 200 bp
downstream from the 82-bp miR-128-1 precursor was amplified from
U87MG genomic DNA and cloned into the pMIF-cGFP-Zeo lentiviral vector
(System Biosciences).
A 3¶-untranslated region (UTR) reporter vector was constructed by
ligating a 338-bp fragment of the Bmi-1 3¶-UTR encompassing the target
sequence for miR-128 from U87MG genomic DNA into pGL3 control vector
(Promega). This construct was mutated using the QuickChange kit
(Stratagene), in which the predicted miR-128 target site cactgtga was
substituted with a tgttgtga. Primer sets (5¶-3¶) were as follows: pri-miR-128-1

Expression of miR-128 reduces proliferation of glioma cells
in vitro and in vivo. We first used a microarray to compare
miR expression profiles in glioblastoma with adjacent normal
human brain tissue. Among several differentially expressed miRs,
we found that miR-128 was strongly down-regulated in glioblastomas (Table 1). This was verified by real-time PCR, which showed
that mature miR-128 levels in human glioblastoma samples were
strikingly and consistently reduced compared with those from
adjacent brain devoid of gross tumor (Fig. 1A). miR-128 is encoded
by two distinct genes, miR-128-1 and miR-128-2, which are
processed into an identical mature sequence. miR-128-1 and
miR-128-2 are both intronic, embedded in the R3HDM1 gene on
chromosome 2q21.3 and ARPP21 on chromosome 3p22, respectively. miR-128 is enriched in brain (16), but its function is not
known. We initially determined whether overexpression of miR-128
would have an effect on the phenotype of cultured glioma cells.
Stable transduction with a lentiviral vector containing the primary
transcript of miR-128 (pri-miR-128-1) produced high levels of
mature miR-128 in U87 and U251 glioma cells (Fig. 1B). Mir-128–
transduced cells showed reduced proliferation compared with
control cells, as measured by cell counting (Fig. 1C) or by Wst1 cell
viability assays (data not shown). Similarly, a short hairpin
oligonucleotide mimic of pre-miR-128-1 led to high levels of
mature miR-128 expression and significantly reduced the proliferation of U87 and U251 glioma cell lines compared with a control
oligonucleotide (Fig. 1C). The fold increase in miR-128 expression

B, expression of mature miR-128 was measured by

counts were performed in triplicate 4 d after plating
20,000 cells. The fold growth of cells at day 4 over
initial count at day 0 is shown in the graph. D, U87

in transfection experiments was similar to the difference in
expression observed between patient tumor samples and surrounding normal brain, indicating that the effects are of physiologic
significance. Flow cytometry revealed a significant decrease in the
percentage of glioma cells in S phase after miR-128 transfection,
with no significant alterations in the sub-G0 apoptotic population
(reduction in S phase in miR-128–transfected glioma cells
compared with controls = 0.705 F 0.053; P = 0.005).
When implanted in the flanks of athymic mice, the growth of
U87 cells expressing pri-miR-128-1 was significantly decreased
(Fig. 1D). Flank tumors expressing miR-128 were 50% smaller than
controls (n = 11 animals per group; SD = 17.7%; P = 1.42  10 6).
Thus, miR-128 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation of
glioma cells both in culture and in vivo.
Bmi-1 is a direct target of miR-128. miR-128 has multiple
predicted conserved targets in the human genome.4 Initially, we

selected a panel of predicted targets known to play a role in glioma
biology or regulation of cell differentiation and self-renewal. In a
RT-PCR–based screen, we observed a consistent 5-fold downregulation in expression of the Bmi-1 gene across three glioma
cell lines transfected with pre-miR-128-1 oligonucleotide. This
was also seen in the pri-miR-128-1 stably transduced cell lines and
also by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Results with other potential
targets were neither as consistent nor as significant (data not
shown). The Bmi-1 gene acts as part of the polycomb repressor
complex (PRC1) that plays a role in epigenetic gene silencing by
chromatin modifications (10). Bmi-1 also plays a role in stem cell
renewal, a process that is also known to be important in glioma
(11, 12). Indeed, Bmi-1 has recently been shown to play an
important oncogenic role in glioma formation in a mouse model
(13). The TargetScan miR target prediction tool predicts a strong
(8-mer overlap in the seed region) and highly conserved miR-128
target site in the 3¶-UTR of Bmi-1 at position 467-488 (Fig. 2B). A
338-bp fragment encompassing this region inserted 3¶ of a
luciferase expression cassette significantly reduced luciferase
expression after pre-miR-128-1 transfection in a dose-dependent

manner (Fig. 2B). Mutagenesis of the predicted miR-128 binding
site blocked this effect (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that miR128 negatively regulates the expression of Bmi-1, a neural stem cell
and glioma maintenance factor, directly through its predicted miR128 binding site.
RT-PCR and staining studies carried out on a panel of
glioblastoma and normal tissues confirmed the down-regulation

of miR-128 in tumor and the converse up-regulation of Bmi-1 (Fig.
2C). However, to determine whether there is a significant inverse
correlation between miR-128 and Bmi-1 levels, it will be necessary
to analyze a much larger sample set. In situ hybridization of patient
glioblastoma sections and normal brain showed expression of
miR-128 in brain, but not in glioma cells (Fig. 2D), whereas
immunostaining for Bmi-1 showed its up-regulation with no

detectable expression in normal brain (Fig. 2D). This confirms Bmi1 up-regulation in glioblastoma where there are also significantly
reduced levels of miR-128 in contrast to normal brain, further
supporting a model of Bmi-1 regulation by miR-128.
miR-128 causes changes in glioma cells consistent with the
down-regulation of Bmi-1, including a reduction in selfrenewal capacity. The main function of the Bmi-1–containing
PRC1 complex is to maintain the silencing of specific genes
through modifying chromatin structure (10). PRC1 recognizes
trimethylated histone 3 (H3K27) and causes its effects through
histone ubiquitylation and by promoting further H3K27 trimethylation (10). Because levels of H3K27me3 are reduced in Bmi1 /
mice (17), we sought to determine if down-regulation of Bmi-1
by miR-128 led to a decrease in this marker. Figure 3A shows
that glioma cells transfected with pre-miR-128-1 had reduced
H3K27me3 levels compared with controls. We then investigated
two more molecular readouts associated with reduced Bmi-1 levels.
Recently, loss of Bmi-1–mediated self-renewal of neural stem cells
was shown to be associated with up-regulation of p21CIP1 (12) and
decreased Akt activation (18). Expression of miR-128 in glioma cells
not only led to a decrease in Bmi-1 protein levels but also to a
concomitant overexpression of p21CIP1 and a decrease in
phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 3B). This does not discount the possibility
that the effects of miR-128 may be due to its actions on targets
in addition to Bmi-1; however, its effects on glioma cells are
biochemically consistent with Bmi-1 reduction, leading to a
decrease in H3K27 methylation and modulation of cellular
pathways involved in cell cycle exit and cell survival (p21CIP1
and Akt).
Finally, we examined the effects of miR-128 on glioma selfrenewal, a phenotype that is thought to be a characteristic of the
glioma stem-like cell subpopulation and may be under the control
of Bmi-1 (12). Cells from freshly excised surgical glioblastoma
specimens were grown under conditions thought to maintain the
glioblastoma stem-like cell population (2, 4). As described in
Materials and Methods, these cells (OHG02) express the features
that define ‘‘stem cell–like’’ (progenitor, initiator) characteristics.
When miR-128 was overexpressed in these neurosphere cultures,
Bmi-1 levels were reduced, consistent with the cell line data (data

not shown). In addition, we observed a significant decrease in the
number and volume of OHG02 neurospheres stably expressing
miR-128 compared with controls (Fig. 3C and D), suggesting that
miR-128 is acting on glioma cells at least in part by blocking Bmi1–mediated pathways involved in stem cell renewal.
Regulators of Bmi-1 expression are likely to be critical
determinants of normal stem cell maintenance and renewal, and
increasingly, it seems that they may also dictate the ability of
tumors, such as glioblastoma, to self-renew. In this study, we have
been able to identify miR-128 as one such regulator. This will likely
be of relevance not only for studies related to normal nervous
system development and neural stem cell maintenance but also to
glioma biology. Furthermore, therapeutic modalities using miR-128
gene delivery or miR-128–like nucleic acids may now be pursued in
an effort to target the self-renewing glioma cell subpopulation.
Physiologically, miR-128 doubtless has its effects through actions
on multiple targets in concert with other miRs. For example,
epidermal growth factor receptor is a target of miR-128 in lung
cancer (19). However, in glioma, Bmi-1 is the most robustly and
consistently down-regulated target in a panel of glioma cell lines,
and our data are consistent with the idea that Bmi-1 is a major
target of miR-128 in gliomas. Another down-regulated miR in
glioblastoma (miR-124) plays a direct role in promoting neuronal
differentiation (20), suggesting that the coordinated action of
multiple miRs is vital in the maintenance of undifferentiated
glioma stem-like cells.
