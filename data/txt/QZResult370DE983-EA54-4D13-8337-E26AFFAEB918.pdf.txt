Ets1 identiﬁed as a novel molecular target of RNA aptamer
selected against metastatic cells for targeted delivery of
nano-formulation
J Kaur and K Tikoo
Nanomedicine era is not far from its realization, but a major concern of targeted delivery still stands tall in its way. Herein we
demonstrate the mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of an RNA aptamer (Apt) conjugated to geﬁtinib-loaded poly
(lactic co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (GNPs). Apt was selected through Cell-SELEX (systemic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment) process against geﬁtinib-resistant H1975 lung cancer cells. The selected aptamer exhibited high speciﬁcity toward
H1975 cells, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Software analysis using the MATCH tool predicted Ets1, a proto-oncoprotein,
to be the target of the selected aptamer. Interestingly, the localization of identiﬁed aptamer varied in descending order of Ets1
expression, wherein maximum localization was observed in H1975 cells than in MDA-MB231, DU-145, H23, H460, A431, A549 and
MCF-7 cells, and minimum in L132 cells. Furthermore, Apt-GNP bio-conjugate showed augmented anticancer activity speciﬁcally in
Ets1-overexpressing cells. In addition, partial depletion of Ets1 in H1975 cells and overexpression of Ets1 in L132 cells reversed the
targeting efﬁcacy of the aptamer. Notably, a single intratumoral injection of the Apt-GNP bio-conjugate abrogated the growth
of tumor in H1975 xenograft nude mice. Altogether, we present a pioneering platform, involving aptamers, which can be clinically
used as a diagnostic marker for metastasis as well as an effective delivery system to escort the pharmaceutical cargo speciﬁcally
to Ets1-overexpressing highly progressive tumors.

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung
cancer, which is accompanied with a very high reoccurrence rate
of 30–60% depending upon the stage of cancer.1 Hyperactive
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, the leading
cause of non-small cell lung cancer, leads to unrestrained cellular
proliferation and increased survival, resulting in cellular transformation and tumor progression.2 Thus, EGFR emerged as an
attractive target for lung cancer therapy. Geﬁtinib, which is a
selective EGFR (ErbB1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevents autophosphorylation of EGFR in various tumor cell lines and xenografts.3
The major hindrance to an effective anticancer activity of geﬁtinib
is the resistance, which arises in the cells after repeated
administration of geﬁtinib. T790M mutation accounts for almost
50% of the cases in which geﬁtinib resistance arises. T790 is often
referred to as the ‘gatekeeper residue’. Substitution of the
threonine at this codon with a bulkier residue, such as methionine,
is believed to sterically hinder the binding of geﬁtinib.
To circumvent this problem, we developed a drug delivery
platform, speciﬁcally against T790M mutant lung cancer cells,
involving RNA aptamer and drug-loaded nanoparticles. Ellington
and Szostak,4 and Tuerk and Gold5, in 1990, independently
described the method of aptamer selection and termed it as
systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX).
This process was designed to select highly speciﬁc aptamer
sequences against deﬁned targets. Lately, the process of Cell-

SELEX has taken over the conventional method of aptamer
selection. Cell-SELEX allows the selection of molecular aptamers
against cancer cells of interest without any prior knowledge of
cell-surface marker proteins, and are thus more ﬂexible and
practical to use than other molecular marker-based methods.
Aptamers, which can speciﬁcally identify the brain tumor-initiating
cells,6 liver cancer,7 ovarian cancer8 and prostate cancer cells,9
have been isolated by various research groups.
The novelty of this report lies not in the aptamer selection
procedure but in target validation. As stated above, various
researchers have reported the selection of cell-speciﬁc aptamers,
but only a handful studies involve the identiﬁcation of the
aptamer target.10 We used the well-reported Cell-SELEX process
for selecting speciﬁc aptamer for H1975 T790M mutant lung
carcinoma cells (described in Supplementary Figure 1). However,
we went a step further and validated the target of aptamer by
using bioinformatics approach, which yielded an oncogenic
transcription factor Ets1 as the target of our selected aptamer.
Our results collectively support the strong candidature of our
selected aptamer as a targeting agent for Ets1-overexpressing
cells. We provide a pioneering report describing the selection of
an RNA aptamer, which can be internalized and retained not only
within the cells against which it was selected but also a variety of
other metastatic cells that abundantly express the oncogenic
transcription factor Ets1.

RESULTS
Selected aptamer exhibits high qualitative and quantitative
afﬁnity toward H1975 lung cancer cells
The secondary structure of the resultant sequence obtained after
12 iterative cycles of Cell-SELEX selection was predicted by using
Mfold software (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Albany, NY, USA)
(Supplementary Figure 2). We used the truncated sequence for
our study so as to avoid nonspeciﬁc binding (Table 1). Both the
target metastatic cancer cells (H1975 cells) and counter-selective
noncancer cells (L132 cells) were incubated with Texas Redlabeled aptamer for 60 min. The microscopic images undoubtedly
reﬂect that the localization of aptamer was much higher in H1975
cells as compared with counter-selective L132 cells. Interestingly,
in H1975 cells, the aptamer localizes within the nucleus, whereas
in L132 cells no signiﬁcant aptamer internalization was observed
(Figure 1a). The higher afﬁnity of aptamers has been attributed to
the various three-dimensional structures assumed by them.11 It is
worthy to note that the localization of our selected aptamer is not
limited to the cell surface or cytosol, but the aptamer localizes
efﬁciently within the nucleus. Therefore, this makes our selected
aptamer ideal for targeting drugs within the cell. To determine
nonspeciﬁc localization, H1975 and L132 cells were treated with
Texas Red-labeled initial RNA library. Supplementary Figure 3
shows the representative results for both the cell types treated
with Texas Red-labeled library, wherein both the cell types did not
exhibit signiﬁcant localization of the RNA library sequences.
Aptamer localization was also studied qualitatively in a panel of
other cancer cells, including lung cancer (H23, H460 and A549
cells), skin cancer (A431 cells), breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDAMB231 cells) and prostate cancer cells (DU-145 cells), and the
representative images are shown in Figure 1a. As is evident by the
microscopic images, the localization of Texas Red-labeled aptamer
was limited in all the cell lines used for the study. H23 lung cancer,
MDA-MB231 breast cancer and DU-145 prostate cancer cells show
slightly greater accumulation of aptamer, but nuclear localization
is not observed in any of these cells. Thus, we inferred from the
images that our selected aptamer has maximum ability to
internalize and be retained within H1975 lung cancer cells. We
further aimed to quantify the internalization of our selected
aptamer within the above panel of cells.
Figure 1b clearly depicts that the highest internalization was
observed in H1975 cells (90%). All the other cell types under study
showed signiﬁcantly lower internalization of aptamer. Similarly, to
assess any background localization, all the cell types under study
were treated with Texas Red-labeled initial RNA library and the
amount of internalized RNA sequences was quantiﬁed. As
observed earlier, cells did not show signiﬁcant internalization of
RNA library (Supplementary Figure 4). This further conﬁrms our
above observations and implied that aptamers are speciﬁcally
binding to and internalizing within H1975 lung cancer cells.
Aptamer conjugated to drug-loaded nanoparticles shows high
cytotoxic effect speciﬁcally in H1975 cells
To investigate the feasibility of using the selected aptamer for
transporting pharmaceutical cargoes within cancer cells, we
conjugated them with geﬁtinib-loaded poly (lactic co-glycolic acid)
nanoparticles (GNPs), the synthesis, characterization and

mechanism of action of which we have reported earlier.12 Thereafter, we checked if this bio-conjugate (Apt-GNPs) can speciﬁcally
arrest the growth of H1975 geﬁtinib-resistant lung cancer cells. Here
we sought to evaluate not only the anticancer activity but also the
speciﬁcity of aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles.
All the cell types under study were treated with comparative
dose of geﬁtinib, GNP, aptamer and Apt-GNP for 48 h, after which
the cell viability was assessed. Apt-GNP conjugated formulation
showed higher anticancer activity as compared with GNPs and
free drug geﬁtinib, explicitly in H1975 cells (Figure 2a). Interestingly, L132 counter-selective cells along with the other cell types
did not show any signiﬁcant difference between the cell death
caused by GNPs and Apt-GNPs, except for H23, MDA-MB231 and
DU-145 cells, but the difference was signiﬁcantly lower as
compared with that in H1975 cells. Speciﬁc cytotoxic effect in
H1975 cells corroborated with our previous results and clearly
implies that our selected aptamer speciﬁcally identiﬁes the target
H1975 cells. We also checked the cytotoxic effect of unconjugated
aptamer and GNP on H1975 cells (Supplementary Figure 5). The
ﬁgure clearly shows that the cytotoxic effect of unconjugated
aptamer and GNP was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the
conjugated system. From this data, we infer that both aptamer
and GNPs should be conjugated for augmented cytotoxic effect.
Thus, from all the above results, we conclude that our selected
aptamer speciﬁcally identiﬁes H1975 cells and augments the
anticancer activity of GNPs probably by increasing the internalization capability and retention of GNPs. For this, we qualitatively
assessed the internalization of bio-conjugate by using 6-coumarinloaded nanoparticles. H1975 and L132 cells were treated with
aptamer conjugated to 6-coumarin-loaded nanoparticles and
observed under ﬂuorescent microscope (Figure 2b). The ﬂuorescence intensity of 6-coumarin is observed to be much greater in
H1975 cells treated with aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles as
compared with cells treated with nanoparticle (NPs) alone, which
suggests greater internalization and retention of Apt-GNP bioconjugate as compared with GNPs alone. This further conﬁrms that
the increased cytotoxic effect observed in cells treated with the bioconjugate was due to enhanced localization of NPs within the cells.
We also checked if greater internalization of Apt-GNPs resulted
in increased expression of molecular entities altered by GNPs
alone. As we have reported earlier, GNPs show higher anticancer
activity by augmenting the expression of histone acetyltransferases p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). In this study, also we
observed a sharp increase in the expression of p300 in GNPtreated cells (Figure 2c). Interestingly, treatment with Apt-GNPs
further resulted in an increased expression of p300 in H1975 cells.
Similarly, the levels of H3 acetylation were also signiﬁcantly higher
in Apt-GNP-treated cells as compared with untreated, geﬁtinib-,
GNP- or aptamer-treated cells. We propose that our system is
utilizing the histone acetyltransferase activator activity of GNPs
and selective targeting ability of aptamers to show the increased
anticancer activity of geﬁtinib in H1975 cells.
Ets1 emerged to be the target of the selected aptamer as
identiﬁed by the MATCH bioinformatic tool
As observed in Figure 1a, the selected aptamer had a tendency to
localize within the nucleus, which was very intriguing. Thus, we
used the online bioinformatics tool, the MATCH, to check if our
selected aptamer showed speciﬁcity toward any of the transcription factors present in the cells. The MATCH software (MATCH,
Beverly, MA, USA) is used to determine the transcription factorbinding sites within nucleic acid sequences.13 Interestingly, the
bioinformatic tool suggested the existence of Ets1 binding site
within our selected aptamer.
Ets comprises of a family of transcription factors whose genesis
lies in E26, an avian erythroblastosis virus, which carries v-ets
oncogene. Ets1 is generally associated with poor prognosis of

cancer, which very well explains its high levels in H1975 lung
cancer cells. Link between ETS-domain transcription factors and
cancer has been well established.14 Direct interaction of aptamer
with Ets1 is further conﬁrmed by the fact that ETS-domain proteins
bind to sequences, which have a central GGA motif.15 Sequence
analysis of our selected aptamer showed that the aptamer indeed
has this central moiety, and probably owing to its presence the
aptamer was identifying the Ets1 transcription factor or vice versa.
Moreover, DNA-binding activity of Ets is also regulated by binding
of coregulatory transcription factors. Incidentally, the activity of
Ets1 has been closely associated with histone acetyltransferases

p300 and CBP. Ets1 recruits CBP and p300, which further
accelerates the downstream cascade.16 These all reports can very
well explain all our earlier observations.
To conﬁrm that our sequence is binding speciﬁcally to H1975 cells
owing to the presence of Ets1, we measured the mRNA levels of Ets1
in all the cell types used in the study. The mRNA levels of Ets1 were
astronomically higher in H1975 cells as compared with any of the
other cell types (Figure 3a). Also, the protein levels of Ets1 were
signiﬁcantly higher in H1975 cells, suggesting active translation of
this protein within these cells. Another interesting observation we
want to highlight here is that the mRNA and the protein levels of

was qualitatively analyzed by using the Texas Red-labeled aptamer. Cells were incubated with the Texas Red-labeled aptamer for 60 min under
standard conditions. Thereafter, the cells were observed under ﬂuorescent microscope. In all the images, the nucleus is stained as blue (DAPI),
and the red color (Texas Red) signiﬁes the presence of aptamer. The extent of aptamer internalization and retention observed in H1975 cells
was much more than that observed in any other cells. (b) Quantiﬁcation of internalized aptamer. Percentage of cells that internalized the

then scrapped, washed and loaded onto the Tali Cellular Analysis Slide by pipetting the sample in half-moon-shaped sample loading area. The
slide was inserted in the cytometer and the reading was recorded. Three independent experiments were performed for each cell type. All
values are represented as mean ± s.e.m.; n = 3; ***P o0.001 vs H1975.

Ets1, although not as high as in H1975 cells, were relatively higher in
H23, MDA-MB231 and DU-145 cells as compared with other cell
types. This can very well explain our earlier observations of slight
increase in aptamer internalization and cell death in these cells.
To further conﬁrm that our selected aptamer speciﬁcally
identiﬁes Ets1 transcription factor, we investigated whether the
treatment of H1975 cells with aptamer-GNP bio-conjugate results
in any change in the levels of Ets1 and its downstream molecule
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Interestingly, we observed a
signiﬁcant decrease in the protein expression of Ets1 and its
downstream molecule MMP-13 in H1975 cells treated with the
bio-conjugate (Figure 3b). All our data conclude that aptamer
indeed is blocking the Ets1 pathway for cell proliferation and thus
showing higher efﬁcacy. Furthermore, as can be seen in Figure 3c,
the Texas Red-labeled aptamers co-localize with Ets1 protein in
H1975 cells, which strengthens our above observations.
Ets1 depletion in H1975 cells lowers the accumulation of aptamer
To reconﬁrm that our aptamer was recognizing H1975 cells owing
to the presence of high levels of Ets1, we inhibited the expression
of Ets1 in H1975 cells by using endoribonuclease-prepared siRNAs
(esiRNAs) against it. We checked if the selected aptamer could
identify H1975 cells even after silencing Ets1 gene. Complete
knockdown of Ets1 resulted in extensive cell death and hence, we
© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited

could only partially silence it. Figure 4a clearly shows that on
increasing the concentration of esiRNA, percentage of knockdown
increased.
H1975 cells with silenced Ets1 showed lower internalization of
Texas Red-labeled aptamer as compared with Ets1-positive cells
(Figures 4b and c), both qualitatively and quantitatively. The
percentage of H1975 cells internalizing aptamer reduced from
90% to only 40% when the Ets1 was silenced in these cells. This
further convinced us that the aptamer is exercising its activity by
identifying Ets1 in H1975 cells. Moreover, no signiﬁcant cell death
was observed in Ets1-silenced H1975 cells after treatment with
aptamer-conjugated nanoparticles (as compared with GNPs;
Figure 4d).
Overexpression of Ets1 in L132 cells renders them aptamer sensitive
To further validate our above observation, L132 cells were
transfected with Ets1 plasmid so as to overexpress Ets1 protein
in these cells (Figure 5a). Ets1-overexpressing L132 cells showed
higher internalization of Texas Red-labeled aptamer (Figures 5b
and c). Moreover, higher cell death was observed in Ets1overexpressing L132 cells treated with Apt-GNP as compared
with control L132 cells (Figure 5d). These transfection assays
demonstrate, beyond doubt, that the presence or absence of Ets1

in the cells was the deciding factor for the successful anticancer
effect of our aptamer-based drug delivery platform.
Here we would like to highlight an advantage of aptamer-based
delivery system over the use of siRNA. One of the limiting factors
of siRNA-based therapy is the off-target effect of these antisense
oligonucleotides, whereas aptamers have very low likelihood of
such off-target effects as suggested by the previous reports.17 Ets
family consists of members with oncogenic as well as tumorsuppressive activities. siRNA, even though nonspeciﬁcally, inhibits
the other members of Ets family, which includes the tumor
suppressors Ets2, Elf5 and PDEF (Supplementary Figure 6).
Interestingly, aptamers did not decrease the mRNA levels, but
instead increase the levels of these tumor-suppressive proteins.

Figure 1.

Even though the exact mechanism behind this behavior is still
unclear, however, the most plausible explanation may involve the
compensatory expression of Ets family proteins. We have tried to
give a rational explanation for this in Supplementary Text.
Aptamer-NP bio-conjugates exhibit high efﬁcacy in H1975
xenograft model of lung cancer
The fact that Apt-GNP was uniquely able to target H1975 cells
in vitro did not ensure their efﬁcacy in vivo. Various issues can
come up with the drug delivery platform that involves aptamer,
the major concern being its stability. Thus, to ensure that our AptGNP system works in the biological milieu, we evaluated the

dye (Life Technologies) was added per 100 μl of cell suspension and incubated for 1 min in dark. The sample was then loaded on the Tali
Cellular Analysis Slide and the slide was inserted in the cytometer. The percentage of viability (%) was then noted. Similarly, untreated cells
were also assessed by this method where the viability of cells was 100%. All values are represented as mean ± s.e.m.; n = 3; ***Po 0.001,

presence of bio-conjugate, whereas the DAPI stains the nucleus in blue. (c) H1975 cells were treated with 8 μM geﬁtinib, GNPs, aptamer and

acetylation. However, Apt-GNP treatment results in even higher expression of p300 and H3 acetylation, thus suggesting higher anticancer
activity. Actin and H3 total loading control is also shown. All values are represented as mean ± s.e.m.; n = 3; **P o0.01, ***P o0.001 vs control.

decrease in the growth of tumor. A signiﬁcant difference was
observed in the tumor size of control and Apt-GNP-treated
animals after the completion of the study (Figure 6b). Moreover,
we also observed a signiﬁcant difference between the tumor

volumes of GNP- and Apt-GNP-treated animals at 20th-day
interval. As depicted in Kaplan–Meier survival curve (Figure 6c),
all the animals in the Apt-GNP-treated group survived the
21-day period, whereas the animals in the other three groups
were killed during the 21-day period when they reached the
end point.

We assessed the levels of toxicity experienced by the animals of
each group by analyzing the effect of geﬁtinib, GNP and Apt-GNP
on body weight loss (BWL; Figure 6d). The saline group
demonstrated BWL that paralleled their tumor load. A very high
BWL was observed in animals treated with geﬁtinib and GNP.
Signiﬁcantly lower BWL was observed in Apt-GNP-treated animals.
This pattern of BWL can be explained if we consider that in
geﬁtinib- and GNP-treated animals, whole drug does not
internalize within the tumor and is thus causing systemic
absorption and distribution leading to higher toxicity. Whereas
in Apt-GNP-treated animals, the instant binding and internalization of GNPs within the tumor will ensure that whole of the drug is
released within the tumor itself.18 After the animals were killed,
the tumor was used for histopathological analysis, which clearly
indicated the signiﬁcant ﬁbrotic damage to the tumor tissue of
Apt-GNP-treated animals. Some degree of damage can also be
observed in the tumor of GNP-treated animals, but saline- and
geﬁtinib-treated animals do not show any such signs of ﬁbrosis
(Figure 6e).
Thus, higher efﬁcacy of Apt-GNP as compared with free drug
and GNPs, both in vitro and in vivo, suggests the suitability of this
platform for the treatment of highly progressive cancers. The
aptamer increases the residence time of the NPs within the cancer
cells expressing high levels of Ets1 protein. The presence of Ets1
has been detected not only in the nucleus but also in the
cytoplasm as well.19,20 Probably, it is this cytoplasmic Ets1 that
helps to retain the aptamer sequence within the cell. Higher
accumulation and concentration of the drug not only lead to
higher efﬁcacy but also to lower toxicity of it.
DISCUSSION
Various strategies have been designed for intracellular delivery of
nanoparticles including modiﬁcation of surface topology and
charge.21 However, a huge limitation of such an approach arises
owing to nonspeciﬁcity of these nanoparticles, owing to which
they are taken up and retained within the cells without any
discrimination. Ligand-conjugated nanoparticles have also been
studied extensively and have been reported to enhance the
cellular uptake of nanoparticles by receptor-mediated endocytosis
and thus provide cell-targeting speciﬁcity.22 However, again for
such an approach, we require well-characterized cancer antigens
for the development of ligands against them. Owing to the
diverse nature of cancer cells, there always exists a deﬁcit for
diagnostic and therapeutic markers.23 The selection of aptamers
against puriﬁed proteins has an advantage of optimal enrichment
during the selection process, but Cell-SELEX process is preferred
when the clear marker target is unknown. Herein we selected
aptamer against H1975 lung cancer cells that possess T790M
mutation in EGFR domain, the leading cause of tyrosine kinase
inhibitor resistance. The selection process was performed under

normal physiological conditions by Cell-SELEX process. We chose
L132 lung cells (noncancer cells) as our counter-selective cells so
as to avoid selection of nonspeciﬁc aptamers, which may bind to
normal lung cells. The selected aptamer exhibited high speciﬁcity
toward H1975 cells and did not internalize within the normal cells.
Thus, they were suitable to carry anticancer drugs and retain them
within the cancer cells only.
Various research groups all over the world are engaged in
developing effective platform for cancer therapeutics by using
aptamers.9,24,25 Several reports indicate that aptamer-conjugated
drugs show higher effect as compared with unconjugated drugs/
nanoparticles,26 although the exact mechanism through which
these aptamers augment the anticancer activity has not been
evaluated in detail. Our study also shows that the aptamerconjugated nanoparticles exhibit higher anticancer activity as
compared with free drug and NPs alone. It is anticipated that
higher accumulation of the drug might be the reason behind it.
Although higher accumulation of the nanoparticles within the
tumor does explain higher activity of the conjugates to some
extent, it was intriguing that our selected aptamer was showing
such high speciﬁcity toward H1975 cells and was accumulating
speciﬁcally within the nucleus. The speciﬁc localization of aptamer
in the nucleus suggested that it could be interacting either with
chromatin or with transcription factors present inside the nucleus.
Thus, we checked, through bioinformatic tools, the reason behind
aptamer speciﬁcity and as a result we obtained Ets1 as our
probable target.
A variety of solid tumors including epithelial tumors, sarcomas
and astrocytomas possess Ets1.27,28 High levels of Ets1 in lung and
squamous cell carcinoma have been linked with a higher
incidence of lymph node metastasis. There is also a growing
body of evidence, which suggests that Ets1 has a key role in
acquisition of invasive behavior. The genes that respond to Ets1
include metalloproteases MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9 and urokinasetype plasminogen activator.29 These proteases are involved in the
degradation of extracellular matrix, which is a key event in the
process of metastasis. These evidences along with the results of
transfection assays (Figures 4 and 5) convinced us that there exists
a deﬁnitive role of Ets1 behind the augmented anticancer activity
of aptamers conjugated to GNPs.
Moreover, our in vivo studies also showed the higher efﬁcacy of
Apt-GNP conjugates over free drug. A signiﬁcant difference was
observed in tumor volumes of untreated animals and Apt-GNPtreated ones. However, a statistically signiﬁcant result in tumor
volumes of GNP- and Apt-GNP-treated animals was obtained only
at 20th-day interval. The growth of tumor in both these groups
paralleled till 2 weeks after which the increase in tumor volume
was lowered in Apt-GNP-treated animals. This can be explained on
the basis of increased retention of Apt-GNPs within the tumor.
In summary (Figure 7), an aptamer-based drug delivery system
was developed, which was although designed to target H1975

was compared with the levels observed in H1975 cells. All values are represented as mean ± s.e.m.; n = 3; ***Po 0.001 vs control. The protein
level of Ets1 was also assessed in all the cell types by immunoblotting. The protein from the cells was extracted as described in Materials and
methods section. Protein estimation was performed by Lowry’s method. Equal amounts of protein were then loaded on 10% polyacrylamide
gel and transferred on polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membrane. Ets1 was detected by using anti-Ets1 and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled
secondary antibody. The fold change in Ets1 protein levels was calculated with respect to the levels of Ets1 in H1975 cells.
All values are represented as mean ± s.e.m.; n = 3; ***Po0.001 vs control. Both the mRNA and protein levels suggest signiﬁcantly higher
levels of Ets1 in H1975 cells as compared with all other cells. (b) Changes in the protein expression of Ets1 and MMP-13 in H1975 cells after the

protein was extracted from these treated cells as described in Materials and methods section. The levels of Ets1 and MMP-13 were checked by
immunoblotting. The fold change was calculated with respect to untreated cells. All values are represented as mean ± s.e.m.; n = 3;

T790M mutant lung cancer cells, but our studies show that it
works effectively in Ets1 transcription factor overexpressing
metastatic cancer cells. Impact of this delivery system generates
tremendous signiﬁcance because of its absolute speciﬁcity toward
Ets1, which is highly abundant in a vast variety of progressive
cancer cells. In addition, the small size of the aptamer ensures
lower cost of the targeting vehicle as compared with the
antibodies. Our drug delivery system eliminates the probability
of chronic accumulation of the targeting system as aptamers are
merely composed of nucleic acid, which will degrade once their
assigned job is completed. The novelty of our study and
advantage of our formulation is not only its increased efﬁcacy
but also more importantly, its safety through aptamer conjugation
(Apt-GNP). Apart from that, this bio-conjugate system can also be
used for diagnostic purposes to identify aggressive tumors.
Oncogene (2015) 5216 – 5228

Collectively, this aptamer-based drug delivery platform is an ideal
clinical candidate for effective drug delivery as well as for the
diagnosis of progressive cancers. Further clinical studies are
required to assess the applicability of this delivery system in
humans.

Conjugation of selected aptamer with GNPs

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

GNPs in DNase–RNase-free water (10 g/l) were treated with
400 mM 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and 100 mM
N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) for 15 min at room temperature with mild
agitation to give the corresponding NHS-ester. The NHS-activated NPs
were washed twice using double distilled water to remove unbound NHS.
The activated nanoparticles were then conjugated to 5′-NH2-modiﬁed
aptamer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) of 2% weight compared with polymer
concentration for 2 h at room temperature with gentle stirring. The
resulting aptamer-conjugated poly (lactic co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles
were washed three times with DNase–RNase-free water.

The intellectual property rights of the above described delivery system comprising of
the aptamer-NP bio-conjugate are protected under Indian Patent Ofﬁce (Indian
Patent application no: 1623/DEL/2014).

Cytotoxicity of aptamer-NP conjugates
In vitro cytotoxicity was determined using the Tali Viability Kit-Dead Cell
Green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Brieﬂy, cells (5 × 104 cells per well)
were treated with 10 μM free drug, GNPs or GNP loaded on aptamer in
medium (without fetal bovine serum, unless denoted otherwise; 37 °C;
5% CO2) for 48 h; and were then scrapped and collected by centrifugation. The cytotoxicity assay was performed as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Brieﬂy, 1 μl of SYTOX dye was added per 100 μl of cell
suspension, vortexed and incubated for 1 min in dark. A volume of 25 μl
of sample was then loaded on the Tali Cellular Analysis Slide by pipetting
the sample in the half-moon-shaped sample loading area. The slide was
then inserted within the slide port of the Tali Image-Based Cytometer.
The percentage of viability (%) was then noted. Similarly, untreated cells
were also assessed by this method in which the viability of cells
was 100%.

Partial knockdown of Ets1 in H1975 cells
H1975 cells were plated in cell culture dishes and allowed to grow in
antibiotic-free medium. The cells were allowed to grow till 50% conﬂuence
before esiRNA treatment. An amount of 40 nM of esiRNA (Sigma) was used
for partial knockdown of Ets1 in cancer cells as described in the
Supplementary Text.

Transfection of Ets1 in L132 cells
The full-length cDNA clone of Ets1 was obtained from Origene (Rockville,
MD, USA). Transfection of Ets1 in L132 cells was performed as per the
manufacturer’s instructions and is described in the Supplementary Text.

In vivo anticancer efﬁcacy evaluation
Female nude mice weighing 18–20 g, from National Institute of Nutrition,
Hyderabad, India, were obtained (IAEC13/13) and transferred to the
pathogen-free environment of the National Toxicology Center in National
Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, SAS Nagar, India. The
animals were maintained in sterile and clean cages with HEPA ﬁlters under
standard diet for nude mice with free access to water and at controlled
room temperature of 22 ± 2 °C. All the animals were acclimatized for
a minimum period of 1 week before the start of experiment and also
properly maintained with all necessary attention until the experiment
was over.
Injection of geﬁtinib-resistant cells in nude mice. Xenografts of geﬁtinibresistant lung cancer cells were established by injecting 3 × 106 viable cells
into the ﬂank/leg region of nude mice to produce tumors. The tumor size
was checked twice weekly, and when the tumor was visible it was
measured twice weekly with vernier calliper. Thereafter, the animals were
treated with geﬁtinib, GNPs and Apt-GNPs.
