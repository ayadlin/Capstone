ABSTRACT
Although hypoxia is a prominent feature contributing to the therapeutic
resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) against chemotherapeutic agents,
including the Topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38, the underlying mechanism is not fully
understood and its understanding remains a major clinical challenge. In the present
study, we found that hypoxia-induced nuclear translocation and accumulation of
YAP acted as a survival input to promote resistance to SN38 in HCC. The induction
of YAP by hypoxia was not mediated by HIF-1α because manipulating the abundance of
HIF-1α with CoCl2, exogenous expression, and RNA interference had no effect on the
phosphorylation or total levels of YAP. The mevalonate-HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR)
pathway may modulate the YAP activation under hypoxia. Combined YAP inhibition
using either siRNA or the HMGCR inhibitor statins together with SN38 treatment
produced improved anti-cancer effects in HCC cells. The increased anti-cancer effect
of the combined treatment with statins and irinotecan (the prodrug of SN-38) was
further validated in a human HepG2 xenograft model of HCC in nude mice. Taken
together, our findings identify YAP as a novel mediator of hypoxic-resistance to SN38.
These results suggest that the administration of SN28 together with the suppression
of YAP using statins is a promising strategy for enhancing the treatment response in
HCC patients, particularly in advanced stage HCC cases presenting hypoxic resistance.

INTRODUCTION

SN38, an active metabolite of irinotecan, has also
encountered similar hypoxic resistance in HCC cells. SN38
exerts its anti-cancer activities by inhibiting topoisomerase
I, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. Our
previous study found that under hypoxia, HCC cells are
highly resistant to a variety of topoisomerase I inhibitors,
including SN38 and TPT [4]. However, the underlying
mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
It has been considered that the major regulator
of cellular adaptation to hypoxia is the hypoxiainducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [5–8], whose contribution
to chemoresistance has been demonstrated in a variety
of cancer cell models, particularly in HCC cells [9–11].
However, the recent findings on the HIF-1-independent

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most frequently occurring cancer worldwide. Because
most HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages,
chemotherapeutic treatment is among the most commonly
used strategies of intervention. However, the treatment
of advanced-stage HCC remains a major challenge,
owing partially to the chemoresistance. Recent studies
have shown that the frequently occurring hypoxic
microenvironment (hypoxia) in HCC plays a key role
in the resistance toward chemotherapeutic drugs such as
sorafenib [1, 2] and irinotecan [3, 4] used in the treatment
of HCC, and contributes to the poor therapeutic outcome.

RESULTS

regulation of tumor angiogenesis [12–14] and chemo­
resistance [15–17] under hypoxic conditions have
challenged this notion and raised the possibility that some
other molecules/signaling pathways may also promote the
malignancy under hypoxia.
Recent studies have identified the novel
transcriptional co-activator, the Yes-Associated Protein
(YAP), as an oncoprotein closely correlated with the
development of HCC. YAP is an independent prognostic
marker of HCC because it is overexpressed in 62% HCC
patients [18], and modulates the liver size and liver
tumorigenesis [19–23]. As a transcriptional co-factor,
the nuclear YAP initiates the transcription by interacting
with the DNA-binding transcription factors EA domain
family members 1–4 (TEAD1-4) [24–26]. The nuclear
localization is among the most important regulatory
mechanisms of YAP, and this process is tightly controlled
by a kinase cascade, namely, the Hippo pathway, which
comprises the mammalian STE20-like 1/2 (MST1/2) and
the large tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2) in mammalian
cells [19, 20]. The MST1/2 phosphorylates and activates
LATS1/2, which then phosphorylates YAP, causing
its cytoplasmic retention and thereby inhibiting the
transcription of YAP target genes, such as CTGF and
AREG, involved in the cell proliferation and survival.
The inhibition of YAP by upstream kinases could
be relieved by events such as disturbed cell polarity,
loss of cell-cell contact, and mechano-transduction
[19, 27–29], activating YAP and promoting cancer
cell survival, chemoresistance, metastasis, and the
other malignant properties. A recent study by Ma et al.
demonstrated that hypoxia modulates Hippo signaling
through SIAH2-mediated degradation of LATS2, leading
to the activation of YAP to promote breast cancer cell
proliferation and growth [30]. However, the cellular roles and
biological function of YAP in hypoxic HCC remain elusive.
In the present study, we found that hypoxia
promoted the chemoresistance of human HCC cells
toward SN38, as evidenced by the increased IC50 values
and reduced apoptosis rates. In hypoxic HCC cells and
in the hypoxic regions of the human HCC xenografted
models, YAP was predominantly localized to the nucleus,
which was accompanied by increased mRNA level of the
YAP target genes CTGF and AREG. The small interfering
RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of YAP expression
sensitized the hypoxic HCC cells to the SN38 treatment.
Further studies showed that under hypoxia, the nuclear
translocation of YAP was not mediated by HIF-1α but
relied on the elevated level of HMG-CoA reductase
(HMGCR). Accordingly, the inhibition of HMGCR by
statins significantly prevented the nuclear translocation
and activation of YAP under hypoxia, and led to the
enhanced anti-cancer activity of SN38. These findings
suggest that the inhibition of YAP by statins may be a
promising therapeutic strategy to combat the hypoxic
resistance of HCC cells to SN38.

HCC cells were resistant to SN38 under hypoxia
Previous studies have reported the hypoxia-induced
resistance of cancer cells to topoisomerase I inhibitors
treatment [3, 4]. To confirm this, in the present study, we
examined the cell survival and apoptosis in SN38-treated
cells under normoxia (20% O2) and hypoxia (1% O2).
The human HCC cell lines HepG2, SMMC-7721, and
Bel-7402 were treated with SN38 for 48 h and the cell
viability was determined using the SRB assay. As shown
in Figure 1A, the survival ratio of SN38-treated cells under
normoxia was lower than that of the cells under hypoxia.
Specifically, 0.25  μM SN38 significantly decreased
the viability of normoxic HepG2, SMMC-7721, and
Bel-7402 cells, resulting in the survival rate of 29.8%,
49.8%, 59.7%, respectively, whereas under hypoxia,
0.25 μM SN38 moderately inhibited cell proliferation, as
evidenced by the survival rates of 73.0%, 79.5%, and
79.7%, respectively. And the hypoxic resistance factors
(IC50-hypoxia/ IC50-normoxia) were calculated to better
illustrate the differential activity of SN38 under hypoxia
and normoxia. The resistance factor in HepG2, Bel-7402
and SMMC-7721 cells were 14.58 ± 2.42, 12.57 ± 2.36,
10.93 ± 2.92, respectively (Figure 1A). Additionally, BrdU
proliferation [38] and trypan blue exclusion assays [39]
were introduced to further display the hypoxia resistance.
As shown in Figure 1B (right panel), a significant
reduction of proliferation inhibition, determined by BrdU
colorimetric assay, was observed in hypoxic SN38-treated
groups. The proliferation inhibition ratio dropped from
56.8% (hypoxia) to 16.9% (normoxia). Similar results were
obtained from trypan blue exclusion assay (Figure 1B,
left panel). SN38 exerted potent cell killing effects on
normoxic HepG2 cells (48.8%), whereas under hypoxia,
the cell death ratio was significantly reduced (24.1%).
In addition, 0.25  μM SN38 markedly induced
apoptosis of normoxic HepG2 cells, with a 58.6%
sub-G1 population; but the extent of apoptotic cell
death was reduced to 34.4% in hypoxic HepG2 cells
(Figure 1C), which was accompanied by reduced
cleavage of PARP (MW: 89 kD) (Figure 1D). These data
demonstrate that hypoxia confers resistance to SN38 and
apoptosis in HCC cells.

Hypoxia triggered nuclear translocation and
total protein accumulation of YAP
It has been recently reported that hypoxia induces
YAP activation by regulating the Hippo signaling pathway
in breast cancer cells [30]. However, the precise role(s) of
YAP activation under hypoxia remained unknown. Because
it appeared that HIFs may not be the sole mediators
of hypoxic resistance, we examined whether YAP was
activated in the hypoxic HCC cells and contributed to the
6934

resistance toward SN38. The results of immunostaining
analyses showed that hypoxia triggered a significant nuclear
translocation of YAP in HepG2, Bel-7402, and SMMC7721 cells (Figure 2A). Consistent with these observations,
the cell fractionation analysis showed the accumulation
of YAP protein in the nuclear fraction of HepG2 cells
under hypoxia, whereas little YAP was detected in the
nuclear fraction under normoxia. In the contrast, much less
cytoplasmic YAP was detected under hypoxia (Figure 2B).
The nuclear translocation of YAP was primarily
regulated by phosphorylation. Dephosphorylated YAP
translocates into the nucleus, where it binds transcription
factors, activating target genes expression while preventing
its own cytoplasmic sequestration and subsequent
degradation. Therefore to further understand the regulation
of YAP by hypoxia, we examined the effect of hypoxia

on the phosphorylated and total YAP levels. As shown in
Figure 2C, in HepG2 cells, YAP protein level was found
to be increased under hypoxia, which was accompanied
by a dramatic reduction in the phosphorylated YAP levels.
Similarly, the other HCC cells, Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721
also exhibited remarkable loss of p-YAP (Figure S1). To
further determine whether a similar trend in the nuclear
accumulation and total expression of YAP under hypoxic
conditions occurred in vivo, xenograft models were created
by subcutaneous injection of HepG2 cell suspensions
into nude mice, and the hypoxic region was stained with
Hypoxyprobe™-1 (Pimonidazole Hydrochloride, PIMO). As
shown in Figure 2D, the YAP accumulation and its nuclear
localization were evident in the PIMO-positive hypoxic
regions. In contrast, the PIMO-negative regions showed
much less density of YAP.

Taken together, these results indicated that hypoxia
caused the nuclear translocation of YAP, likely preventing
the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation and
leading to the accumulation of YAP.

(Figure 3A and 3B) attenuated the increase in the mRNA
expression of CTGF and AREG (Figure 3A). These data
suggested that hypoxia-induced nuclear accumulation of
YAP led to the activation of its downstream target genes
and likely contributed to the hypoxia response, including
the chemoresistance.
Therefore, we examined whether the activation
of YAP and its target genes under hypoxia contributed
to the SN38 resistance. The half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values of SN38 in HepG2, Bel-7402,
and SMMC-7721 cells transfected with scramble control
or YAP siRNA were determined under normoxic and

We analyzed the mRNA levels of the YAP target

genes were significantly upregulated in hypoxic HCC cells

was significantly less than that under normoxia. However,
the YAP depletion effectively rendered the hypoxic cells
susceptible to SN38-induced apoptosis. Consistent with this
observation, we also found that the cleavage of PARP, which
marked the apoptosis, was increased in YAP knockdown
SN38-treated hypoxic HepG2 cells compared with their
control siRNA-expressing counterparts (Figure 3E).
To further confirm the critical roles that YAP played
in the hypoxic resistance to SN38, we introduced YAP
(5SA) mutant which lacked five serine phosphorylation
sites, insensitive to phosphorylation, thus predominantly
located in the nucleus [27]. As shown in Figure 3F, the
exogenous mutant of YAP (5SA) significantly rescued the
loss of viability of SN38-exposed cells under hypoxia.

hypoxic conditions. SN38 exhibited much less activity
in hypoxic HCC cells than in normoxic cells. Notably, as
assessed from the lower IC50 values, the YAP knockdown
significantly sensitized the hypoxic cells toward SN38
(Figure 3B, 3C, S2A and S2B). Interestingly, hypoxic
HCC cells were preferentially sensitized by YAP depletion,
as indicated by decreased cell survival (Figure S2C) and
remarkable lower hypoxic resistance factors compared
to scramble groups (Figure S2D). On the contrary, those
normoxic cells were minimally impacted.
Next, we employed PI stating and FACS analyses
to evaluate the effect of YAP knockdown in the apoptosis
of SN38-treated HepG2 cells. As shown in Figure 3D,
the sub-G1 population in the hypoxic SN38-treated cells

Figure 3: YAP promoted the hypoxic resistance of HCC cells to SN38. (A) The qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the mRNA
levels of CTGF and AREG were upregulated under hypoxia (24 h), whereas the YAP siRNA attenuated the increased expression under
hypoxia. (B) The YAP knockdown was achieved by the transfection of the cells with YAP-targeting siRNA sequence. The SMMC-7721,

YAP enhanced the SN38-induced cytotoxicity (48 h) in HCC cells under hypoxia. (D) The apoptosis (sub-G1 population) caused by SN38

The IC50 values of SN38 under hypoxic were: 1.82 µM
for NC siRNA group, 0.48 µM for YAP siRNA group, and
1.63 µM for YAP siRNA + YAP (5SA) group, respectively.
These data collectively indicated the crucial roles of
hypoxia-activated YAP in the hypoxic chemoresistance of
HCC cells toward SN38.

Because HIF-1α has been considered a master
regulator of cellular response to hypoxia, we examined
whether the hypoxia-mediated activation of YAP was
HIF-1α-dependent. For this purpose, we suppressed
the expression of HIF-1α using siRNA and used
BNIP3, a product of HIF-1α target gene, to monitor the
function of HIF-1α (Figure 4A). Immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence analyses showed that the reduction
in YAP phosphorylation, the increased YAP protein
expression, and the nuclear translocation of YAP under
hypoxic conditions were not impaired by the depletion of
HIF-1α (Figure 4A, 4B and S5A).
Cobalt dichloride (CoCl2) has been used to stabilize
HIF-1α in cells to mimic hypoxia [40]. Therefore, the
HepG2 cells were treated with CoCl2 (150 μM) to induce
HIF-1α accumulation under normoxia (Figure 4D).
However, our results showed that the HIF-1α thus failed to
trigger the nuclear translocation of YAP under normoxia,
suggesting that the HIF-1α protein under normoxia
could not mimic the hypoxia micro-environment, which
facilitates the nuclear translocation of YAP (Figure 4C).
Additionally, the total YAP level was not affected by
CoCl2 (Figure 4D), although p-YAP was reduced, raising
the possibility that YAP was subjected to some other posttranslational modification, such as ubiquitination, caused
by CoCl2 [41], thus decreasing the stability.
To further verify that YAP accumulation by hypoxia
was not mediated by HIF-1α, we overexpressed HIF-1α by
introducing the pCMV6-HIF-1α plasmid into the HepG2
cells. The results showed that HIF-1α overexpression under
normoxia, as assessed by the expression level of the Myctag, had little effect on the YAP accumulation (Figure 4E).
Thus, under normoxia, neither the CoCl2-stimulated
accumulation of HIF-1α nor its exogenous expression
resulted in YAP activation.
Collectively, these results clearly suggested that the
hypoxia-induced nuclear translocation and accumulation
of YAP was HIF-1α-independent and therefore may be due
to some other regulatory mechanism(s), particularly those
that are responsive to hypoxia.

HMGCR-mevalonate pathway because earlier reports
have indicated that this pathway might be upregulated
under hypoxia [45]. Therefore, we compared the mRNA
and protein levels of HMGCR under normoxic and
hypoxic conditions and found that both were upregulated
in hypoxic HepG2 cells (Figure 5A and 5B). Notably, the
HMGCR knockdown significantly attenuated the nuclear
translocation of YAP under hypoxia (Figure 5C and
S5B), accompanied with hypoxic accumulation of YAP
total protein (Figure 5B). Interestingly, the mevalonic
acid (MVA) (0.5 mM, 24 h) treatment greatly reduced
the nuclear accumulation of YAP under hypoxia even
in the HMGCR knockdown cells (Figure 5C and S5B).
Additionally, compared with the HMGCR knockdown cells,
the total YAP protein level was also increased in MVAtreated HMGCR knockdown cells (Figure 5B). We then
introduced statins, a class of HMGCR inhibitors widely
used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, to block
the MVA production. As shown in Figure 5D and 5E, the
treatment with either atorvastatin or pravastatin prevented
the nuclear accumulation of YAP under hypoxia, whereas,
co-treatment with MVA abolished these effects (Figure 5D
and S5C). These results further suggested the involvement
of the MVA pathway in the nuclear translocation of YAP
under hypoxia. Moreover, the increased accumulation of
total YAP protein under hypoxia was also prevented by the
treatment with atorvastatin or pravastatin (Figure 5F).
Because it has been reported that the cellular YAP
localization and protein stabilization are negatively
regulated by two components of the Hippo signaling
pathway, namely the LATS and MST kinases, we examined
the phosphorylation levels of these two kinases, which
reflects their activity. As shown in Figure 5G, neither CoCl2
nor hypoxia caused any alterations in protein expression
or phosphorylation of the MST kinase. However, the
phosphorylated LATS1 (p-LATS1) was significantly
reduced in hypoxic HepG2 cells, with a slight reduction in
the total protein level also visible under these conditions
(Figure 5G). Consistent with this observation, CoCl2
treatment failed to produce any effect on the p-LAST1 and
total LAST1 (t-LATS1) levels. Interestingly, the hypoxiainduced changes in t-LATS1 and p-LAST1 levels were
rescued, at least partially, in HepG2 cells treated with
atorvastatin or pravastatin (Figure 5H). These results
indicated that the HMGCR-mevalonate pathway played
indispensable roles in the activation of YAP under hypoxia,
likely through the regulation of LATS1 kinase. The results
also suggest that the introduction of HMGCR inhibitors,
statins, might be a useful strategy to combat the hypoxiainduced resistance of HCC to SN38.

induced activation of YAP but also open the opportunity
to utilize statins as a potential strategy to combat the
SN38 resistance under hypoxia.
To test our hypothesis, we treated the HepG2 cells
with or without statins, and then incubated these cells
under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. These cells were
then subjected to SRB analyses to investigate whether
the statins rescued the cells from the hypoxia-mediated
SN38 resistance. As shown in Figure 6B, the sensitivity

effects of statins were blocked by the co-treatment
with MVA. Together with our observation that YAP is
critical for the hypoxia-mediated SN38 resistance in
HCC cells (Figure 3), these results not only support
our hypothesis that statins could interrupt the hypoxia-

of the cells to SN38 was lower under hypoxia than
under normoxia. However, the co-treatment with either
atorvastatin (5 µM, 48 h) or pravastatin (10 µM, 48 h)
increased the sensitivity of hypoxic HepG2 cell to SN38,
although statins alone had little effect on the cell survival.
The improved anti-cancer activity of SN38 in the presence
of statins was also reflected in its IC50 values (Figure 6B).

As shown in Figure 6C, co-treatment with atorvastatin
enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of SN38 in hypoxic
HepG2 cells, with the cell survival fraction declining
from 91.40%, 72.29%, and 52.51% to 76.72%, 51.44%,
and 35.66%, respectively, in the presence of 0.08, 0.25,
and 2.00 µM-SN38, respectively. Similarly, at these
concentrations of SN38, the co-treatment with pravastatin

reduced the cell survival fraction from 93.48%, 75.05%,
and 51.67% to 78.37%, 53.14%, and 34.99%, respectively.
These data suggest that the administration of statins along
with SN38 may serve as a promising new strategy for
overcoming the hypoxia-induced resistance of HCC cells
to SN38 treatment.
To further characterize the effects in vivo, the
combined anti-cancer activity of statins and irinotecan, a
prodrug of SN38, was evaluated in HepG2-xenografted
models of nude mice. As shown in Figure 6D, the
intraperitoneal administration of 2.5 mg/kg irinotecan
3 times per week moderately reduced tumor growth, with a
T/C value of 0.81 (mean RTV: irinotecan vs. vehicle: 11.81
vs. 14.58; p = 0.045). Atorvastatin treatment, 100 mg/kg
daily o.g., alone produced no significant effects on the
tumor growth compared with that in the vehicle group
(mean RTV, atorvastatin vs. vehicle: 14.03 vs. 14.58).
However, when combined with atorvastatin, the anticancer activity of irinotecan was greatly extended, with
a T/C value of 0.56 (mean RTV: irinotecan + atorvastatin
vs. vehicle: 8.18 vs. 14.58, p = 0.0003; irinotecan +
atorvastatin vs. irinotecan: 8.18 vs. 11.81, p = 0.036).
Furthermore, we performed immunofluorescence
analysis of the xenografted tumors from the nude mice
administrated by irinotecan and/or atorvastatin. As shown
in revised Figure 6E, YAP was mainly located in the
cytosol of the tumor cells obtained from atorvastatin- or
the combination-administrated mice, suggesting that the
nuclear translocation of YAP was suppressed by atorva and
irinotecan+atova. However, irinotecan imposed minimal
effect on the nuclear localization of YAP (Figure 6E),
which was consistent with the results obtained from
cellular models (Figure S4). In line with Figure 6E, the
p-YAP levels in atorvastatin- and combination groups
were enhanced, denoting the prohibition of nuclear
translocation of YAP in these groups (Figure 6F).
Together with the results of our in vitro studies, these
results suggested that the administration of statins might
be a promising new strategy to alleviate or overcome the
hypoxic resistance of HCC to SN38, probably through the
inhibitory effects on hypoxic-activated YAP

with small molecules agents, thus opening the unexplored
routes for therapeutic intervention aiming at combat with
drug resistance under hypoxia.
Recent studies reported that YAP overexpression
and activation is correlated with poor prognosis of
cancer patients [18, 40], likely because it promotes
tumor progression [27, 41] and/or metastasis [42–44].
Accumulating evidence suggests that the activated YAP
contributes to the drug resistance of cancer cells. Using a
genetic screen, Lin et al. identified that YAP plays a key
role in promoting the drug resistance to RAF- and MEKtargeted cancer therapies [45]. Others found that YAP
conferred resistance toward chemotherapeutic agents
such as 5-FU [46], cisplatin [47, 48], taxol [48, 49], and
bleomycin [48] in a variety of cancer models, including
ovarian cancer [48], squamous carcinoma [47], and
colon cancer [46]. However, although a recent report
[30] demonstrated the activation of YAP under hypoxic
conditions, the contribution of activated YAP to resistance
to anticancer agents remained to be investigated. Given
the important roles of YAP in promoting the anti-apoptotic
and pro-survival mechanisms of cancer cells [50, 51], it
appeared likely that the YAP pathway also played a key
role in promoting the resistance to therapeutic agents.
Here, for the first time, we established the link between
the nuclear translocation of activated YAP and the hypoxic
resistance toward SN38 in HCC models.
Consistent with the results of an earlier study
using breast cancer cell models [30], we found that
YAP was activated in HCC cells under hypoxia and
in the hypoxic regions in xenografted tumor models.
Our results showed predominant nuclear localization
of YAP, prevented the cytoplasmic retention and
subsequent degradation, thus increased the protein
stability of YAP (Figure S3), and activated YAP
target genes under hypoxic conditions (Figure 2).
Intriguingly, the inhibition of YAP pathway, which
prevented the nuclear translocation of YAP (Figure 5),
either by YAP knockdown or using statins abolished the
hypoxia-induced resistance of HCC cells toward SN38, as
evidenced by the decreased cell survival and/or increased
apoptosis rates of YAP knockdown cells treated with
SN38, especially those under hypoxia (Figures 3 and 6).
More importantly, the concurrent administration of SN38
and atorvastain in the HepG2 xenografted nude mice
models produced improved anticancer effects (Figure 6).
Several small molecules have been shown to
interfere with the activation of the YAP pathway.
Specifically, statins, inhibitors of the mevalonate
metabolic pathway widely used for the treatment of
hypercholesterolemia, were shown to potently inhibit the
YAP pathway by preventing the nuclear accumulation
of YAP (statins) [37, 52] and thereby interfering with
the transcription of YAP target genes. By doing so,
statins were endowed with the ability to suppress cancer
metastasis, which may partially explain the anti-cancer

DISCUSSION
Because it has been shown that HIF-1α is the master
regulator of diverse cellular processes under hypoxic
conditions, a wide range of pharmacological approaches
have been developed to interrupt its activity. Several
small molecules were found to alleviate the hypoxic drug
resistance and arrest the tumor xenograft growth through
the inhibition of HIF-1α [4, 39]. Despite these efforts,
an agent that targets HIF-1α is still not under clinical
application. Therefore, there is an urgency to identify an
alternative “druggable” molecule, that 1) mediates (or acts
coordinately with HIF-1α) the malignant cellular behavior
such as hypoxic resistance and 2) could be easily targeted

MATERIALS AND METHODS

effects of these inhibitors. However, whether statins can
improve the efficiency of chemotherapy under hypoxia
remained unknown. The results on the sensitization of
hypoxic cells by statins to SN38 treatment extended the
current knowledge regarding the beneficial effects of
these compounds by providing evidence for the feasibility
of using statins to treat aggressive tumors that present
hypoxic resistance to SN38 or other Topoisomerase I
inhibitors. The alleviation of the hypoxic-resistance by
statins may largely be due to its interference with the
activation of YAP under hypoxic conditions.
In agreement with the results of an earlier study
[30], we found that under hypoxia, the phosphorylation
level of YAP decreased, which was accompanied by a
significant increase in the nuclear localization of YAP and
increased accumulation of total YAP protein (Figure 2). In
mammalian cells, the subcellular localization of YAP is
predominantly modulated by the LATS1/2 kinase cascade.
Activated LATS1/2 induces the phosphorylation of YAP,
leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by
proteasome. When provoked by specific signals such as loss
of cell-cell contact or disturbed cell polarity, the LATS1/2mediated suppression of YAP activation is relieved,
allowing the nuclear translocation of this transcriptional
co-activator, where it binds to TEADs to activate the target
gene transcription. In the present study, we found that the
p-LATS1 level was reduced following the hypoxic stimuli,
but this reduction in the p-LAST1 levels was attenuated in
statin-treated hypoxic HCC cells (Figure 5). These results
suggested that the HMGCR activated under hypoxia
might contribute to the dephosphorylation of LATS1 by
modulating RhoA [52]. In cells treated with statins, the
total LATS1 and LATS2 protein level was also slightly
decreased (Figure 5), which was consistent with the earlier
report on the hypoxic degradation of LATS2 mediated by
the accumulated SIAH2, an E3 ligase of LATS2. Given
the high degree of homology and significant overlap in the
function of LATS1 and 2, they are likely to have similar
features, particularly on the domains modulated by SIAH2
or the other hypoxia-responsive E3 ligase(s).
Notably, HIF-1α, the master regulator of hypoxia,
appeared not to contribute to the hypoxic activation of
YAP. As shown in Figure 3, neither its knockdown nor
its accumulation following the exogenous expression or
CoCl2 treatment had an effect on the nuclear translocation.
Although CoCl2 exposure reduce p-YAP level, the total
YAP was not accumulated, implicating that some other
post-translational modification of YAP, for instance,
ubiquitination, caused by CoCl2 [34] may interfere with
YAP stability (unpublished data). These findings suggested
that the activation of YAP pathway under hypoxia was
HIF-1α-independent. However, according to Ma’s study,
the nuclear YAP may aid in stabilizing the HIF-1α by
binding and maintaining its activity [30]. Thus the present
results underline the significance of YAP in the hypoxic
microenvironment of solid tumors.

Cell lines and cell culture
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2,
SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 were purchased from Cell
Bank of China Science Academy (Shanghai, China) and
maintained in DMEM or RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco,
Grand Island, New York, USA) plus 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. Penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin
(100 U/ml) were added in the medium.

Gene transfection and RNAi
Cells were seeded on 6-well plates, and the medium
was replaced with Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Media
(Invitrogen) containing 20.0 nM siRNA (GenePharma,
China) and oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. The sense sequence
of the YAP siRNA#1, YAP siRNA#2 and HIF-1α siRNA
were 5′-GACAUCUUCUGGUCAGAGATT-3′ [53],
5′-GGUGAUACUAUCAACCAAATT-3′
[54]
and
5′-CUGAUGACCAGCAACUUGATT-3′ [55], respectively.
The pCMV6-HIF-1α plasmid or empty vector were
transfected into cells using the X-tremeGENE HP DNA
Transfection Reagent (Roche, Penzberg, 
Germany) as
recommended by the manufacturer.

Immunofluorescene (IF) staining
HepG2 cells were collected and inoculating
subcutaneously into nude mice. After the tumor size
reached a mean group size of 300–500 mm3, the hypoxia
probe Hypoxyprobe™-1 (Pimonidazole Hydrochloride,
PIMO) (60 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to
indicate tumor hypoxic regions. One hour later, the tumors
were removed and cut into frozen slices. For detection of
the intratumor and subcellular localization of YAP, the
cells grown in glass bottom dishes (Thermo Scientific
Nunc Lab-Tek) as well as the frozen slices were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde, and blocked with 5% BSA,
and incubated with anti-YAP antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, Mass) and FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody (Invitrogen). The slides were than
stained with DAPI and imaged with Leica DMI 400B
fluorescence microscope.

Immunobloting analysis
Immunobloting analysis of proteins in cell lysates
and nuclear fractions was performed as previously
described [56, 57]. Primary antibodies used were as
follows: anti-YAP (#4912), anti-p-YAP (#4911), anti-MycTag (#2278), anti-Mst (#3682), anti-p-Mst (#3681), antiLATS (#3477) and anti-p-LATS (#8654) were purchased

CONCLUSION

from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); antiHIF-1α (#610959) was purchased from BD; anti-β-Actin
(#Sc-47778), anti-Lamin B (#Sc-6216), anti-BNIP3 (#Sc56167), and anti-HMGCR (#27578) were purchased from
Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).

In summary, for the first time, we demonstrated
that the activation of YAP under hypoxia was strongly
correlated with the resistance of HCC cells toward SN38,
a Topoisomerase I inhibitor. Hypoxia inhibited the LATS1
phosphorylation, which triggered the nuclear translocation
of YAP and the subsequent activation of its target genes,
contributing to the decreased anti-cancer activities of
SN38 in hypoxic HCC cells. The present results clearly
suggest that the MVA-HMGCR pathway, but not HIF-1α,
plays a critical role in the hypoxia-induced activation of
YAP, particularly because the HMGCR inhibitor statins
effectively abolished the nuclear translocation and
accumulation of YAP protein under hypoxic conditions.
The SN38, when combined with statins or YAP siRNA,
exerted significantly improved anticancer activity, as
revealed by the enhanced inhibitory effects on HCC cell
proliferation, sensitization to apoptosis, and enhanced
in vivo antitumor efficiency. Collectively, our study
not only provides a rational basis for the combined use
of statins and irinotecan as a promising novel regimen
against HCC in patients presenting hypoxic resistance
but also identifies the YAP signaling pathway to be a
promising new target for the therapeutic intervention of
drug resistance under hypoxic conditions.

Quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
analysis
Total RNA was prepared using the EasyPure RNA
kit (Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China). The “TransScript
One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis
SuperMix” kit (Transgen) was then used to purify the
RNA and synthesise single-stranded cDNA, followed
by SYBR®-Green real-time PCR (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA). The following primers were used: YAP,
5′-CGAGCTCATGCCTCTCCAGCTTCTCTGCAG-3′
(forward) and 5′-GCGGCCGCTATAACCATGTAAGAA
AGC-3′(reverse) [58]; GAPDH, 5′-GTCATCCATGACA
ACTTTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGCTTGACAAAGT
GGTCGT-3′ (reverse).

Cell proliferation and cell death assay
Cell proliferation was assessed by the SRB assay
[59] and BrdU assay [31], and the cell death was monitored
by the Trypan blue exclusion assay [32]. The cell
proliferation inhibition rate for each well was calculated
as (ODcontrol cells − ODtreated cells)/ODcontrol cells ×
100%. By using trypan blue exclusion, cell death in the
cultures were measured as previously described.

Antitumor activity in vivo
Human HepG2 xenografts were established by
subcutaneously inoculating 5 × 106 cells into nude mice.
When the tumors reached a mean group size of 100 mm3 ,
the mice were randomized into control and treatment
groups to receive one of the following daily treatments
for 14 days: vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
intragastric administration (i.g.)); irinotecan (2.5 mg/kg,
intraperitoneal (i.p.)); atorvastatin (100 mg/kg, i.g.);
combination therapy (2.5 mg/kg irinotecan plus 100
mg/kg atorvastatin). Tumor volume (V) was calculated
as V= (length × width2)/2. The relative tumor volume
(RTV) was calculated as RTV = Vn/V0 (Vn was the
tumor volume on day n; V0 was the tumor volume on
the first day of treatment). Therapeutic treatment effects
were expressed in terms of T/C = mean RTV of the
treated group/mean RTV of the control group.
