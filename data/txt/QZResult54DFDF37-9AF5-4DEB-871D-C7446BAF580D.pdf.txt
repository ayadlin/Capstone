Abstract
Insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) mediate mitogenic and antiapoptotic signaling from insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR), insulin receptor (IR), and other oncoproteins. IRS1 plays a central role
in cancer cell proliferation, its expression is increased in many human malignancies, and its upregulation
mediates resistance to anticancer drugs. IRS2 is associated with cancer cell motility and metastasis.
Currently, there are no anticancer agents that target IRS1/2. We present new IGF-IR/IRS-targeted agents
(NT compounds) that promote inhibitory Ser-phosphorylation and degradation of IRS1 and IRS2. Elimination
of IRS1/2 results in long-term inhibition of IRS1/2-mediated signaling. The therapeutic signiﬁcance of this
inhibition in cancer cells was shown while unraveling a novel mechanism of resistance to B-RAFV600E/K
inhibitors. We found that IRS1 is upregulated in PLX4032-resistant melanoma cells and in cell lines derived
from patients whose tumors developed PLX4032 resistance. In both settings, NT compounds led to the
elimination of IRS proteins and evoked cell death. Treatment with NT compounds in vivo signiﬁcantly
inhibited the growth of PLX4032-resistant tumors and displayed potent antitumor effects in ovarian and
prostate cancers. Our ﬁndings offer preclinical proof-of-concept for IRS1/2 inhibitors as cancer therapeutics
including PLX4032-resistant melanoma. By the elimination of IRS proteins, such agents should prevent
acquisition of resistance to mutated-B-RAF inhibitors and possibly restore drug sensitivity in resistant
tumors. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4383–94. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) signaling
pathway is pivotal in many human malignancies (1–5). Upregulation of IGF-IR signaling in cancer cells results from its
overexpression or from upregulation of its ligands, IGF-I and
IGF-II (6–8). IGF-IR signaling is crucial for the establishment
and maintenance of transformation as well as for anchorageindependent growth (9). Moreover, IGF-IR–mediated signaling
signiﬁcantly contributes to the emergence of resistance to
chemotherapy (10), to radiation (11), and to targeted therapies

(12–17). These pro-oncogenic activities of IGF-IR are highly
dependent on its proximal downstream effectors, IRS1 and
IRS2. IRS proteins, once phosphorylated on tyrosine residues
by IGF-IR, transmit mitogenic, antiapoptotic, and antidifferentiation signals to the cell, mainly through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–PKB module (18). IRS1/2 also mediate the
termination of IGF-IR signaling. Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2
by various cellular kinases blocks their interaction with the
receptor and targets them for degradation by the proteasome
(19). This negative feedback loop is the major cellular pathway
that shuts off IGF-IR signaling.
The role of IRS proteins in human malignancies has been
established: overexpression of IRS1/2 causes cell transformation (20, 21) and IRS1 is constitutively activated in many
human tumors, including tumors that display no aberrant
activation of IGF-IR (22). Downregulation of IRS1 (by antisense or siRNA procedures) reverses the transformed phenotype (23). While IRS1 is critical for tumor growth, IRS2 is
essential for tumor metastasis (2, 18, 24–26). Importantly,
IRS proteins integrate signals from multiple kinases other
than IGF-IR, such as insulin receptor (IR), IR/IGF-IR hybrids,
EGF receptor (EGFR), and Src, all of which are involved in
transformation (18, 27–30). Furthermore, IRS1 was found to
be a mediator of resistance to EGFR and mTOR inhibitors
(16, 17).

progression, and metastasis, as well as in acquired drug

anticancer drugs.
Here, we present and characterize a unique family of small
molecules that lead to Ser-phosphorylation and destruction of
IRS1 and IRS2. The elimination of IRS1/2 results in long-term
inhibition of IGF-IR signaling and powerful inhibition of tumor
cell growth.

Cell lines
A375 (human melanoma), HCT116 (colon cancer), HCT15
(colon cancer), SK-ES.1 (Ewing sarcoma), NCI-H460 (lung
cancer) were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).
HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) and F12 (1:1) containing 10% FCS.
DU145 (prostate cancer) were cultured in RPMI containing 5%
FCS and 5 mg/L insulin. All cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. YUMAC, YURIF, YUSIK (all
human melanoma, kindly provided by Prof. Ruth Halaban, Yale
University, New Haven, CT) were cultured in OptiMEM containing 5% FCS. M571, M2068, M560n (all human melanoma),
normal melanocytes, and normal ﬁbroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. Michal Lotem, Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem,
Israel) were maintained in RPMI, DMEM and F12 (1:3:1)
containing 10% FCS. A375SM (metastatic A375 cells; ref. 31)
were maintained in MEM containing 10% FCS. 451-Lu
(human melanoma) and 451-Lu-BR (PLX4032-resistant melanoma; ref. 32) were maintained in RPMI containing 5% FCS
(media for resistant lines contained 1 mmol/L PLX4032). All
media were supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100
mg/mL streptomycin and all cells were grown at 37 C/5%
CO2.
Cell proliferation
Cells were grown in complete medium and treated with
inhibitors one day following seeding. Seventy-two hours later,
the surviving cells were quantiﬁed by methylene blue staining
or by WST-1 staining for nonadherent cells (Roche).
Anchorage-independent growth assay
Cells were plated in 50 mL growth medium containing 0.3%
agar on top of a layer of 100 mL of growth medium containing
1% agar. Fifty microliters of growth medium containing inhibitors was added on top. A week later, representative images
were taken using a microscope eyepiece camera (ANMO
Electronics Corporation) and colonies were stained with
0.5% MTT for 4 hours. The dye was extracted with dissolving
buffer (5 g SDS/8.75 mL DDW/12.5 mL DMF/0.5 mL acetic
acid/0.07 mL HCl). Following overnight incubation at 37 C and
absorbance was read at 570 nm.
Migration assay
Cells were treated with 3 mmol/L NT157 for 18 hours and
wounded at t ¼ 0 using a pipette tip. The medium was replaced
with medium lacking inhibitor, and images were taken at the

indicated times using a microscope eyepiece camera (ANMO
Electronics Corporation).
Subcellular fractionation
Assays were conducted according to the protocol
described by Abcam: http://www.abcam.com/index.html?
pageconﬁg¼resource&rid¼11473. Cytoplasmic fractions
were concentrated using Amicon ultra-4 ﬁlters (Millipore).
Immunoblots
Cells were treated as indicated and lysed with boiling sample
buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, and
5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Western blot analysis was conducted
as described previously (33).
Coimmunoprecipitation
Serum-starved cells were treated as speciﬁed and lysed on
ice. Immunoprecipitation was conducted using 0.5 to 1 mg
total protein, 2 mg antibody, and 50 mL protein A–agarose beads
at 4 C. Bound proteins were eluted with boiling sample buffer,
and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Detailed methods can
be found in the Supplementary Data.
Quantitative PCR
Serum-starved cells were treated with NT157 and then RNA
was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected
to reverse transcription using M-MLV RT (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR ampliﬁcation was conducted using SYBR Green in
a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (ABI). The relative
quantities of gene transcripts were normalized to HuPO
(Human acidic ribosomal protein) transcripts. The following
primers were used: HuPO: forward 50 -GCTTCCTGGAGGGTGTCC-30 , reverse 50 -GGACTCGTTTGTACCCGTTG; IRS1: forward 50 -CTTCTGTCAGGTGTCCATCC-30 , reverse 50 -CTCTGCAGCAATGCCTGTTC-30 ; IRS2: forward 50 -ACAATGGTGACTACACCGAG-30 , reverse 50 -CTGCTTTTCCTGAGAGAGAC-30 .
In vivo tumor growth and survival models
Athymic Nude-nu mice were used for the in vivo studies
described in Fig. 6A–C. To study tumor growth, A375 cells were
injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Once tumor size
reached approximately 75 mm3, mice were treated daily for
12 days by intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of
vehicle or NT157 (Fig. 6A and B). For the survival melanoma
model (Fig. 6C), A375 cells were injected intravenously into
female nude mice (9 mice/group). Administration of vehicle or
NT157 (100 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg) intravenously 3 times a week for
2 weeks (arrows) was initiated 10 days later. Animals that
developed tumor signs were sacriﬁced by an overdose of
anesthetic. The internal organs of the sacriﬁced animals were
then excised to verify tumor development. To study the growth
of 451-Lu-BR tumors (Fig. 7E), cells were injected subcutaneously into female nude mice (10 mice/group). Administrations
of vehicle, PLX4032 (12.5 mg/kg) orally, NT157 (70 mg/kg)
intraperitoneally, or PLX4032 and NT157 were initiated 10 days
later. Tumor volume was measured 3 times a week and animals
were sacriﬁced on day 26.

Destruction of IRS1/2 as a Therapy for Cancers

In vivo model of lung metastasis of A375SM cells
A375SM cells were injected intravenously (7–9 mice/group)
into female athymic BALB/c nude mice, 8–10 weeks. Administration of NT157 (70 mg/kg) intravenously 3 times a week was
initiated 3 days later. Temozolomide (100 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally twice a week. A control group was
given vehicle intravenously. The mice were sacriﬁced after 4
weeks; the lungs were removed and ﬁxed in Bouin's solution for
24 hours. Surface tumor nodules were counted using a dissecting microscope. For further details, see Supplementary
Data.
Immunohistochemistry
A total of 5.0  105 A375SM cells were injected subcutaneously into the right ﬂank of female athymic BALB/c nude mice
(10 mice/group). Ten days later, NT157 was administered
intravenously or intraperitoneally (70 mg/kg) 3 times a week
for 4 weeks. The mice were sacriﬁced 48 hours after the last
treatment, and tumors were processed for immunohistochemical and (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP end labeling) TUNEL assay. To detect the levels of

pS-IRS1/2 and pY(1131)IGF-IR, antibodies were used at 1:50
dilution. Assays were conducted as previously described (34).
TUNEL assay
The TUNEL assay was conducted using a commercial kit
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol, as previously described (34).

Results
The NT compounds constitute a novel family of
anticancer agents that target IRS1/2 to degradation
During our quest for IGF-IR kinase inhibitors, we discovered
a unique subfamily of IGF-IR signaling inhibitors. These compounds, represented by NT52, NT75, NT157, and NT205 (Fig.
1A; ref. 35) were developed by rational design based on a
structure–activity relationship study of our earlier compounds
(Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In a
cell-free assay, the NT compounds exhibited ATP noncompetitive as well as substrate noncompetitive inhibition of the fulllength IGF-IR (Supplementary Fig. S1B) while they did not
inhibit the isolated kinase domain of the receptor (data not

Figure 1. NT inhibitors lead to the dissociation of IRS1/2 from IGF-IR and induce Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2. A, chemical structures of the NT compounds.
The active NT compounds all possess an OH at the 50 position of the aminobenzyl moiety. The control compound C133 possesses a Br substitution
at this position. B, NT compounds, but not C133, induce IRS1/2 Ser-phosphorylation and strongly inhibit IGF-I–induced PKB activation. Serum-starved A375
cells were treated with NT inhibitors for 5 hours, then stimulated with IGF-I for 5 minutes, and lysed. C, NT-induced IRS1/2 Ser-phosphorylation
is IGF-I–independent. Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with NT inhibitors for 5 hours and lysed without IGF-I stimulation. D, NT157 induces the
translocation of IRS1/2 to the cytosol. Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with NT157 as indicated. Cells were stimulated with IGF-I for 5 minutes, lysed,
and fractionated by differential centrifugation.

shown). These data show that the NT compounds are mixedcompetitive inhibitors (36) and namely inhibit IGF-IR in an
allosteric manner. The new compounds were simultaneously
tested for their ability to inhibit IGF-I-induced signaling in cells
(Fig. 1B) and for their antiproliferative activity against various
cancer cell types (Supplementary Table S2). Remarkably, the
NT compounds induced extensive Ser-phosphorylation of IRS
proteins (Fig. 1B and C), in correlation with their ability to
inhibit cancer cell growth (see below).

The inhibitory Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2 led to the
suppression of signaling to PKB in A375 human melanoma
cells (Fig. 1B). We further investigated this phenomenon using
NT157 as the lead compound. NT157 induced the dissociation
of IRS1/2 from the receptor within 30 minutes of treatment
before the Ser-phosphorylation of IRS was evident (Fig. 1D
and Fig. 2A). This dissociation was probably due to a conformational change in IGF-IR induced by the allosteric mode of
binding of NT157. The Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2 is known

Figure 2. NT inhibitors irreversibly direct Ser-phosphorylated IRS proteins to degradation and induce apoptosis. A, NT157 induces IRS1/2 Ser-phosphorylation
and PKB inhibition in a time-dependent manner. Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with 3 mmol/L NT157 as indicated and either stimulated with IGF-I for 5
minutes (left) or not (right) before lysis. B, treatment with NT inhibitors for 17 hours leads to IRS1 and IRS2 elimination and to A375 cell apoptosis.
Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with 3 mmol/L NT75, NT157, or NT205 for 17 hours, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Apoptosis was
detected by PARP cleavage. C, the NT-induced elimination of Ser-phosphorylated IRS1/2 is mediated by the proteasome. Serum-starved A375
cells were treated with 3 mmol/L NT157 or NT75 with or without 10 mmol/L MG132 for 17 hours and lysed. D, IRS1/2 mRNA levels are not affected by
NT157 treatment. Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with 3 mmol/L NT157 and then RNA was extracted and subjected to reverse transcription. PCR
ampliﬁcation was conducted and IRS1/2 mRNA levels were normalized to the levels of the ribosomal protein HuPO. E, the effects of NT inhibitors
on the Ser-phosphorylation and degradation of IRS1/2 are maintained long after removal of the inhibitors. Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with
NT157 (3 or 6 mmol/L) for 4 hours. Cells were then washed, grown without serum for 4, 24, or 48 hours, and lysed. F, NT157 induces the Ser-phosphorylation
and degradation of IRS1/2 in multiple cell lines. Cells were treated with 2.5 or 8 mmol/L NT157. The Ser-phosphorylation and levels of IRS1/2 were tested 5 and
24 hours following treatment, respectively. For HepG2 cells, the levels of IRS1 were tested 4 hours following treatment.

Figure 3. The NT compounds inhibit the migration and anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of A375 human melanoma cells. A, NT compounds, but
not C133, potently block the proliferation of A375 cells. Cells were treated with inhibitors for 72 hours and survival was quantiﬁed by methylene blue
staining. B, NT compounds inhibit A375 anchorage-independent growth. A375 cells were seeded in 0.3% agar and treated with inhibitors for 7 days.
Colony formation was quantiﬁed by MTT staining. Representative images from unstained, NT157-treated cells are shown. C, NT157 inhibits the

to preclude their rebinding to the receptor and transduction of
signaling downstream (19).
IRS1/2 Ser-phosphorylation increased with time (Fig. 2A),
and within 20 hours of NT treatment, IRS1/2 proteins disappeared (Fig. 2B). The autophosphorylation of IGF-IR on
tyrosine 1131 remained intact (Fig. 2A), and only at higher
concentrations of the inhibitors was pTyr-IGF1R directly
inhibited (Fig. 1B). These ﬁndings highlight the unique mode
of action of the NT compounds in intact cells: The primary
mechanism of the NT-induced inhibition of IGF-IR signaling is
a result of the inhibitory Ser-phosphorylation and the subsequent elimination of IRS1/2. In the absence of the key mediators in the pathway, signaling downstream is impeded
regardless of IGF-IR activity. The details of this exceptional
mechanism will be further discussed below.
In fact, the targeting of IRS1/2 for Ser-phosphorylation and
proteasome-dependent degradation is the major cellular
mechanism for shutting off IGF-IR signaling (19, 37). Indeed,
when NT compounds were combined with the proteasome
inhibitor, MG132, Ser-phosphorylated-IRS1/2 accumulated
(Fig. 2C). Furthermore, NT157 did not decrease the mRNA
levels of IRS1 or IRS2 (Fig. 2D). Treatment with NT compounds
eventually led to apoptosis, as shown by the appearance of
cleaved PARP (Fig. 2B). The NT-induced Ser-phosphorylation
of IRS1/2 committed them to degradation. The treatment of
A375 cells with NT157 for a period of 4 hours was sufﬁcient to
induce massive Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2 and subsequent
IRS1/2 degradation, effects that were sustained for at least 48
hours after the removal of NT157 from the medium (Fig. 2E).
Cellular proliferation was strikingly inhibited after 72 hours of

NT treatment. The IC50 values of A375 cell proliferation were
unchanged when cells were treated only once with medium
containing NT157 or NT75, without daily refreshment of the
medium (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), or when the NT
compounds were washed out 24 hours after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D). These data show that a short
treatment with the NT compounds triggers an irreversible
cellular cascade that culminates in cell death.
The elimination of IRS1/2 is a key feature of the NT compounds. The depletion of IRS1/2 from cancer cells should lead
to the inhibition of all signals transmitted through IRS proteins.
Indeed, the effects of the NT compounds on IRS1/2 were IGF-I–
independent (Fig. 1C, Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Because IRS1/2 can also mediate IR signaling, we tested
whether IR activity is affected by NT157. NT157 inhibited
signaling to PKB following stimulation by IGF-II and insulin,
as well as by IGF-I (Supplementary Fig. S3A; 27, 30). Immunoprecipitation of IR from NT157-treated A375 cells conﬁrmed
that its autophosphorylation, like that of IGF-IR, was not
inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C). We conclude that
NT compounds bring about the degradation of IRS1/2, irrespective of the upstream signal, leading to the inhibition of all
signal transduction pathways that converge on IRS1/2.
The Ser-phosphorylation and degradation of IRS1/2 that
were induced by NT compounds were observed in various
human cancer cell lines (Fig. 2F). Thus, the unique mode of
inhibition of IGF-IR signaling by NT compounds is widespread.
The NT compounds displayed potent antiproliferative activity
on many cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table
S2), including lines that are resistant to anticancer agents. The

NT compounds also showed efﬁcacy in inhibiting anchorageindependent colony formation and cell migration of human
melanoma A375 cells (Fig. 3B and C). Notably, NT157 displayed
little to no effect on the survival of normal melanocytes and
ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 3D).
The NT compounds constitute a highly deﬁned family of
chemical entities (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 1A). C133 is
a structural analog of the NT family in which the 50 -OH was
substituted with a Br atom (Fig. 1A). This minor modiﬁcation
abolished the effects on IRS1/2 (Fig. 1B). We found that the
anti-IRS1/2 activity of the NT compounds highly correlated

with their anticancer activities and indeed C133 was only a
weak inhibitor of cancer cell proliferation and of the growth of
A375 cells in soft agar (Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 3A and B).
The ERKMAPK pathway in A375 melanoma cells mediates
NT157-induced Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2
We studied the mechanism of NT action in A375 melanoma
cells, with NT157 as the lead compound. We found that
concomitant to the detachment of IRS1/2 from the receptor
NT157 induced an increased interaction of IGF-IR with the
adaptor protein Shc (Fig. 4A). Shc and IRS proteins bind the

A, NT157 promotes recruitment of Shc to IGF-IR. Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with NT157, stimulated with IGF-I, and lysed. IGF-IR was
immunoprecipitated (IP) and Shc levels in the immunoprecipitated samples were detected. B, time-dependent activation of the ERK–MAPK pathway. Serumstarved A375 cells were treated with NT157 for the indicated times, stimulated with IGF-I for 5 minutes, and lysed. The kinase activity of ERK was
assessed by analysis of the phosphorylation of its direct substrate, RSK. C, the ERKMAPK pathway mediates the NT157-induced Ser-phosphorylation
of IRS1/2. Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with an inhibitor of mutated B-RAF (PLX4720) or of MEK1/2 (PD184352) for 30 minutes, and then
NT157 was added for 4 hours. Cells were then stimulated with IGF-I for 5 minutes and lysed. D, the NT157-induced C-RAF activation is Ras dependent.
Serum-starved A375 cells were treated with an inhibitor of Ras (FTS) for 10 minutes and then NT157 was added for 4 hours. Cells were stimulated with
IGF-I for 5 minutes and lysed. E, the ERKMAPK pathway mediates the antiproliferative effect of NT157. A375 cells were treated with PLX4720 and NT157 for
72 hours and then survival was quantiﬁed by methylene blue staining.

same tyrosine-phosphorylated Tyr950 of IGF-IR (38), and thus
the detachment of IRS1/2 may allow enhanced access of IGF-IR
to Shc. Following the recruitment of Shc to IGF-IR, but before
the Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2, NT157 treatment induced
the activation of the ERKMAPK pathway in A375 cells (Fig. 4B).
In melanoma cells that harbor the mutant B-RAFV600E/K, such
as A375, the ERKMAPK pathway is constitutively active and
therefore plays the key role in IRS1/2 Ser-phosphorylation. The
treatment of A375 cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD184352,
or the B-RAFV600E inhibitor, PLX4720, resulted in nulliﬁcation
of the NT157-induced Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1 and in
alleviation of the NT157-induced inhibition of IGF-I–dependent activation of PKB (Fig. 4C), whereas inhibition of mTOR or
PI3K exhibited no effect (Supplementary Fig. S4B), conﬁrming
that the NT-induced Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2 is dependent on the ERKMAPK pathway in these cells. It has been
previously shown that ERK1/2 is capable of phosphorylating
IRS1 on certain Ser-residues, such as Ser636/639 (19). To study
the mode by which NT157 induced activation of ERK1/2
beyond their basal state in A375 cells, which harbor a constitutively active B-RAFV600E, we checked the phosphorylation
status of C-RAF, which can participate in the ampliﬁcation of
the signal elicited by IGF-IR through Shc (39). C-RAF was
strongly activated following NT157 treatment (Fig. 4B) in
a Ras-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). The events described
above occurred regardless of the kinase activity of IGF-IR,
namely in the absence of IGF-I stimulation (Supplementary
Fig. S4), or in the presence of a speciﬁc IGF-IR kinase inhibitor
(Supplementary Fig. S4F). Importantly, the combined treatment of A375 cells with NT157 and PLX4720 abrogated the
antiproliferative effects of NT157, conﬁrming that these effects
of NT157 are mediated by IRS1/2 phosphorylation and degradation (Fig. 4E).
We propose a model (Fig. 5) whereby the binding of NT157 to
an allosteric site on IGF-IR leads to the detachment of IRS1/2
from the receptor, followed by the recruitment of Shc to the
receptor. This leads to the activation of the ERKMAPK pathway,
which in turn leads to Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2. This
inhibitory Ser-phosphorylation precludes rebinding of IRS1/2
to IGF-IR, blocks IGF-I signaling, and targets IRS1/2 to degradation. The downstream activation of PKB is inhibited and
cell death is induced.
Melanoma tumor growth and metastasis is efﬁciently
inhibited by NT157
We determined the effect of the NT inhibitors on tumor
growth and metastasis in mice. Daily treatment with NT157
resulted in more than 80% growth inhibition of established
human A375 melanoma tumors (Fig. 6A). The antitumor effect
of NT157 was dose-dependent (Fig. 6B). In models of metastasis, NT157-treated mice survived longer than vehicle-treated
controls (Fig. 6C). Moreover, NT157 strongly inhibited the
development of lung metastases of melanoma cells (Fig.
6D). NT157 was at least as effective as temozolomide, which
is often used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma (Fig.
6D). The effect of NT157 on melanoma metastasis correlated
with the inhibitory action of NT157 on melanoma cell migration and colony formation (Fig. 3B and C). Immunohistochem-

ical analysis of the A375SM tumors conﬁrmed our biochemical
ﬁndings reported above (Fig. 1B): Treatment of mice with
NT157 induced increased IRS1 Ser-phosphorylation and apoptosis of tumor cells (Fig. 6E). These observations were
detected 48 hours following the last treatment, validating the
long-lasting inhibitory effect of NT157 also in vivo. At the doses
applied, inhibition of IGF-IR autophosphorylation was also
detected.
Increased expression of IRS1 has been reported in both ovary
and androgen-refractory prostate cancers (26, 40). The efﬁcacy
of NT compounds on tumor growth and mouse survival was
shown using A2780 ovary cancer and PC3 androgen-refractory
prostate cancer xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Resistance to B-RAFV600E/K inhibitor drugs can be
mediated by IRS1/2 upregulation
A new drug, PLX4032/Vemurafenib (41), targeted against
melanomas carrying the common B-RAFV600E/K mutation,
shows remarkable efﬁcacy against metastatic melanoma, but
resistance to PLX4032 emerges and tumors eventually progress
in almost all patients (42). We examined the potential involvement of IRS proteins in the acquired resistance of mutated BRAF melanomas to PLX4032. To this end, we used 2 melanoma
cell lines that have developed resistance to B-RAFV600E/K
inhibition in vitro: 451-Lu-BR and Mel1617-BR. These cell lines
were cloned from the parental metastatic melanoma lines 451Lu and Mel1617, respectively, following continuous exposure
to a B-RAFV600E/K inhibitor (32).
IRS1/2 upregulation is induced by short-term treatment
with B-RAFV600E/K inhibitor and reversed by NT157. In
melanoma cells harboring the constitutively active BRAFV600E/K, the ERKMAPK pathway plays the most important
role in the basal Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2. Indeed, treatment of the parental 451-Lu melanoma cells with PLX4032 led
to inhibition of pERK and to inhibition of the basal Serphosphorylation of IRS2 (as indicated by the electrophoretic
downshift of IRS2, Fig. 7A). Concomitantly, an increase in IRS2
levels was observed (Fig. 7A). Treatment of 451-Lu cells with
NT157 resulted in Ser-phosphorylation and degradation of
IRS1, and accordingly to inhibition of IGF-1R-induced PKB
activation (Fig. 7B). Combined treatment with both inhibitors
resulted in inhibition of both ERK and PKB pathways (Fig. 7B).
Correspondingly, a synergistic cytotoxic effect was observed
when the cells were treated with both inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S6A). As the ERK pathway is crucial for the NT157induced Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2, a sequential treatment
in which NT157 is added to the medium a few hours ahead of
PLX4032 was crucial to gain a synergic effect and avoid an
antagonistic effect of the treatments.
As reported by Villanueva and colleagues, the levels of pERK
were unperturbed by PLX4032 in PLX4032-resistant 451-Lu-BR
cells. PLX4032 did not affect IRS1/2 (Fig. 7A).
In the parental Mel1617 cells, similar to 451-Lu cells, treatment with PLX4032 resulted in upregulation of IRS1 and IRS2,
and the IGF-I–induced activation of PKB was concomitantly
increased (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The levels of pY-IGF-IR
were unperturbed by PLX4032, suggesting that the increase in
pT-PKB levels is a results of the upregulation of IRS1/2.

Figure 5. A 3-step model for the inhibitory effects of NT157 on IRS1 in human
melanoma A375 cells. In human melanoma A375 cells, where B-RAF is
constitutively active, IGF-IR signals mainly through the IRS1/2-PKB axis,
inducing cellular survival and proliferation. NT157 binds to an allosteric site on
IGF-IR and induces a conformational change, leading to the dissociation of
IRS1/2 from the receptor (I). This allows the receptor to interact more strongly
with the adaptor protein Shc and leads to the activation of C-RAF and to
MAPK
. In the next step, cytoplasmic IRS1/2
enhanced signaling to ERK
undergoes extensive Ser-phosphorylation, which is mediated by the ERKMAPK
pathway (II). Ser-phosphorylated IRS1/2 is targeted for degradation by the
proteasome (III) and IGF-IR signaling becomes severely impaired. Thus, NT157
leads to long-lasting IGF-IR inhibition, cancer cell apoptosis, and potent
antitumor effects.

Enhanced levels of IRS1 in PLX4032-resistant cells. Next,
we tested the relative levels of IRS1 in the PLX4032-resistant
cell lines: 451-Lu-BR and Mel1617-BR. Remarkably, we found a
signiﬁcant increase in the levels of IRS proteins in both cell
lines, compared with the levels of IRS proteins in the corresponding parental melanoma lines, which are sensitive to
mutant B-RAF inhibition (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig.
S6C). The dramatic increase in IRS1 level in 451-Lu-BR cells
far exceeded the upregulation of IGF-IR already reported by
Villanueva and colleagues (Fig. 7A; ref. 32). Accordingly, the
IGF-I–induced activation of PKB was enhanced in the
PLX4032-resistant 451-Lu-BR cells, as compared with the
parental sensitive metastatic melanoma cells, 451-Lu (Fig.
7A). In Mel1617-BR, the levels of both IRS1 and IRS2 were
highly upregulated as compared with the parental Mel1617
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6C). The fact that a similar upregulation of IRS levels was found in both PLX4032-resistant cell
lines tested suggests that this may be a common mechanism of
acquired resistance to B-RAFV600E/K inhibition. To further

4390

Cancer Res; 73(14) July 15, 2013

investigate the broad relevance of this mechanism, we expanded our research and analyzed a panel of 6 patient-derived
human melanoma cell lines (Fig. 7C and D): YUMAC, YURIF,
and YUSIK are human melanoma patient-derived cell lines
that contain the mutated B-RAF (43). These patients were not
treated with a mutated B-RAF inhibitor. M2068, M560n, and
M571 are human melanoma cell lines containing the mutated B-RAF, derived from patients that had been treated with
PLX4032 and developed resistance to the drug. Our biochemical analysis validated that in M2068, M560n, and
M571, ERK activation was resistant to PLX4032 treatment,
whereas in YUMAC, YURIF, and YUSIK, ERK activation was
highly sensitive to PLX4032 treatment (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, we found signiﬁcantly higher levels of IRS1 in the
PLX4032-resistant patient-derived cells as compared with
the PLX4032-sensitive cells (Fig. 7D). To summarize, we
detected high levels of IRS1 in melanoma cells that acquired
resistance to mutated B-RAF inhibitors both in culture and
in patients.

Destruction of IRS1/2 as a Therapy for Cancers

Figure 6. NT157 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of melanoma in mice. A, growth inhibition of established human melanoma tumors by NT157. A375 cells

were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Once tumor size reached approximately 75 mm , mice were treated daily for 12 days by intraperitoneal (i.p.)
administration of vehicle or NT157 (20 and 50 mg/kg). B, dose-dependent growth inhibition of established A375 tumors by NT157. The experiment was carried
out as in A. Vehicle or NT157 (5 and 20 mg/kg) were administered intravenously (i.v.). C, NT157 increases the survival of mice bearing A375 tumors.
Cells were injected intravenously into nude mice. Administration of vehicle or NT157 (100 mg/kg) intravenously 3 times a week for 2 weeks (arrows) was
initiated 10 days later. D, NT157 treatment results in a decreased number of pulmonary A375SM metastases in mice. Cells were injected intravenously
into nude mice. Treatment was initiated 3 days later: vehicle or NT157 (70 mg/kg) were administered intravenously 3 times a week, and temozolomide
(TMZ, 100 mg/kg) was administered intravenously twice a week. Mice were sacriﬁced after 4 weeks and the number of tumor nodules on the surface of
the lungs was counted. E, treatment of nude mice harboring A375SM tumors with NT157 results in increased IRS1/2 Ser-phosphorylation, increased
apoptosis, and decreased IGF-IR phosphorylation. Cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Administration of NT157 (70 mg/kg) intravenously or
intraperitoneally 3 times a week for 4 weeks was initiated 10 days later. Samples for immunohistochemistry and TUNEL were taken 48 hours after
the last treatment.

NT157 induced downregulation of IRS1/2 in PLX4032resistant cells and inhibited PLX4032-resistant tumor
growth. In PLX4032-resistant 451-Lu-BR cells, NT157
induced striking Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2, inhibited
signaling to PKB, and led to cell death (Fig. 7B and Supplementary Fig. S6A; Similar data for Mel1617-BR cells is shown
in Supplementary Fig. S6D and S6E). Correspondingly,
NT157 inhibited the growth of 451-Lu-BR tumors in nude
mice (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, enhanced 451-Lu-BR tumor
growth was observed when mice were treated with PLX4032,
possibly due to "drug addiction" (44) and upregulation of the
IGF-IR/IRS1 pathway (Fig. 7E). Combined treatment with
NT157 and PLX4032 suppressed this accelerated tumor
growth (Fig. 7E). Notably, all the cell lines tested, which
had acquired resistance to PLX4032 either in culture or in
patients, showed sensitivity to NT157 in a cytotoxicity assay
(not shown).
To summarize, we found increased levels of IRS1/2 in
melanoma cells treated with PLX4032 and in melanoma cells
that had acquired resistance to B-RAFV600E/K inhibition. The
downregulation of IRS1/2 by NT157 led to cell death and tumor
inhibition of PLX4032-resistant cells.

Discussion
We have discovered an exceptional family of IGF-IR-IRS1/
2 inhibitors. Unlike existing IGF-IR signaling inhibitors, the
NT inhibitors represent a new concept in targeted therapy,
whereby the inhibitor shuts off signaling by taking advantage of a negative feedback loop normally used by cells. This
is brought about by the Ser-phosphorylation and the degradation of IRS1/2, resulting in long-lasting inhibition of
signaling to PKB, and leading to cancer cell death. The
anticancer activity of NT compounds on both IRS1 and IRS2
is highly effective, because IRS1 promotes tumor growth and
IRS2 promotes metastasis. Furthermore, inhibition of both
IRS proteins precludes the compensation of one for the
other.
Importantly, we showed that a short exposure to NT compounds sufﬁced to induce Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2,
directing IRS1/2 to degradation, even after the removal of the
inhibitors. Moreover, the NT157-induced Ser-phosphorylation
of IRS1/2 in A375 tumor cells in mice persisted for at least 48
hours following the administration of the drug. The ﬁnding
that a short exposure to the NT compounds sufﬁces to gain a
long-lasting antitumoral effect has clinical ramiﬁcations. It

allows treatment at relatively low frequencies, which should
lead to reduced side effects.
IR is highly homologous to IGF-IR in structure and function.
It has been shown that selective inhibition of IGF-IR, for
example, by using monoclonal antibodies, can result in compensatory activation of IR by IGF-II, leading to drug resistance
(45). Because IRS1 and IRS2 mediate signaling from both
IGF-IR and IR, the NT compounds lead to the disruption of
signaling downstream of both receptors induced by IGF-I, IGFII, or insulin and reduce the probability of drug resistance.

Approximately 50% of melanomas are driven by B-RAFV600E/K,
and resistance to B-RAFV600E/K inhibition can be mediated by
different pathways (46, 47). Our results reveal that upregulation
of IRS1 and IRS2 proteins is a novel mechanism that leads
to acquired resistance to B-RAFV600E/K inhibition. Similar
mechanisms have been reported for acquired resistance to
EGFR and mTOR inhibitors (16, 17). In all of these cases, the
inhibitors reduce the levels of Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2,
and consequently stabilize IRS1/2 and increase prosurvival
signaling via PKB.

Destruction of IRS1/2 as a Therapy for Cancers

It has been previously shown that in some cases of melanoma IGF-IR is upregulated, leading to enhanced signaling
through IRS proteins (32, 48). The upregulation of IGF-IR
and/or IRS proteins can be effectively reversed by treatment
with NT compounds, leading to tumor cell death. The
present study suggests that combining NT compounds
with B-RAFV600E/K inhibitors should be effective for the
treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma harboring
the mutated B-RAF, and that NT compounds should be
effective for patients showing resistance to B-RAFV600E/K
inhibitors (49). Furthermore, NT compounds may resensitize resistant tumors to B-RAFV600E/K inhibitors. Our results
highlight IRS proteins as critical mediators of tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance and further establish them as important drug targets in cancer.
