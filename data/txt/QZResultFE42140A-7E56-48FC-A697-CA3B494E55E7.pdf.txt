ABSTRACT
Occurring at cytosine (C) of RNA, 5-methylcytosine (m5C) is an important
post-transcriptional modification (PTCM). The modification plays significant roles
in biological processes by regulating RNA metabolism in both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes. It may also, however, cause cancers and other major diseases. Given
an uncharacterized RNA sequence that contains many C residues, can we identify
which one of them can be of m5C modification, and which one cannot? It is no doubt
a crucial problem, particularly with the explosive growth of RNA sequences in the
postgenomic age. Unfortunately, so far no user-friendly web-server whatsoever has
been developed to address such a problem. To meet the increasingly high demand
from most experimental scientists working in the area of drug development, we have
developed a new predictor called iRNAm5C-PseDNC by incorporating ten types of
physical-chemical properties into pseudo dinucleotide composition via the auto/crosscovariance approach. Rigorous jackknife tests show that its anticipated accuracy is
quite high. For most experimental scientists’ convenience, a user-friendly web-server
for the predictor has been provided at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iRNAm5C-PseDNC
along with a step-by-step user guide, by which users can easily obtain their desired
results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations
involved. It has not escaped our notice that the approach presented here can also be
used to deal with many other problems in genome analysis.

one [4] formed by the action of RNA methyltransferases
[5] (Figure 1). The m5C modification is well investigated in
DNA, but the corresponding studies in cellular RNA were
mainly confined to tRNA and rRNA [6].
Actually, the m5C modification site in RNA has
various biological functions, including the one that
can regulate RNA metabolism in both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes [7]. Furthermore, it plays a key role in yeast cell
fate decision [4]. It is also significant for animal (such as
mouse) and human embryonic development [1].

INTRODUCTION
Post-transcriptional modifications (PTCM) of RNA
plays a paramount role for the metabolism processes of
RNAs, such as for their splicing export, immune tolerance,
and transcription [1–3]. So far, more than 100 distinct
PTCMs have been identified in tRNAs, rRNAs, Mt-tRNAs,
miRNAs, lincRNAs, miscRNAs, protein-coding genes,
pseudogenes, etc. [1]. Among these modifications, the
methylation of the 5-methylcytosine (m5C) is an epigenetic

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Although many efforts have been made by using
biological experiments to determine the m5C sites in RNA
(see, e.g. [2, 3]), it is time-consuming and expensive to
completely rely on the experimental approaches alone.
Facing today’s explosive growth of uncharacterized RNA
sequences, it is highly demanded to develop computational
approach to help getting the information.
Very recently, in a pioneering study, Feng et al. [8]
proposed an interesting method to identify RNA m5C sites
via the powerful PseKNC approach [9–11]. But no webserver has been provided for their method, and hence its
practical application value is quite limited. In view of this,
the present study was initiated to fill such an empty area.

A predictor called “iRNAm5C-PseDNC” has been
established. The success rates achieved by it on the
benchmark dataset constructed based on experimental
servations (Supplementary Information 1) are

where the definitions for the metrics Sn, Sp, Acc, and
MCC are given in Eq.13 of the MATERIALS AND
DISCUSSION section later.
Since it is the first web-server predictor ever
developed for identifying the m5C sites in RNA sequences,
it is not possible to demonstrate its power by comparing
with its counterparts for exactly the same purpose.
Nevertheless, we can indirectly show its power via a
cohort of the anticipated success rates (Table 1) reported
from the five powerful web-server predictors in genome
and proteome analyses [12] [13–16]. As we can see from
the table, the iRNAm5C-PseDNC is with the highest
score for Acc (see column 3), and the same is true for
MCC (column 4), indicating the proposed predictor is not
only high in overall accuracy but also quite stable.
Also, it is instructive to point out that, among the
four metrics in Eq.13, the most important are the Acc
and MCC. The metrics Sn and Sp are used to measure a
predictor from two completely opposite angles, and they
are actually constrained with each other [17]. Therefore, it
is meaningless to use only one of the two for comparison
[18]. When, and only when, both Sn and Sp of the
predictor A are higher than those of the predictor B, can
we say A is better than B. In other words, a meaningful
comparison in this regard should count the scores of both
Sn and Sp, or even better, the rate of their combination that
is none but the score of MCC [19, 20].
Now, let us use graphic analysis to further show the
proposed predictor’s quality. Graphs are a useful vehicle
for studying complicated biological systems because
they can provide intuitive insights, as demonstrated by a
series of previous studies (see, e.g., [21–28]). To provide
an intuitive illustration, the graph of Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) [29, 30] was adopted as given in
Figure 2, where the green line is the ROC for iRNAm5CPseDNC. The area under the ROC curve is called the
AUC (area under the curve). Being within the region of
0 and 1, the greater the AUC is, the better the predictor
would be. For the current predictor, the AUC is 0.9626,
which is very close to 1, the value for a perfect predictor.
As shown in a series of recent publications (see,
e.g., [18, 19, 31–43]), papers with a user-friendly and
publicly accessible web-server will significantly enhance
their impacts; this is particularly true for those papers that
were aimed at developing various prediction methods
[44, 45]. In view of this, the web-server for iRNAm5CPseDNC has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.

convenience, a step-to-step guide of how to use it is given

based predictor for a biological system, one should make
the following five steps very clear: (1) how to construct
or select a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the
predictor; (2) how to formulate the biological sequence
samples with an effective mathematical expression that
can truly reflect their essential correlation with the target
concerned; (3) how to introduce or develop a powerful
algorithm (or engine) to run the prediction; (4) how to
properly conduct cross-validation tests to objectively
evaluate the anticipated accuracy; (5) how to provide a
web-server and user guide to make people very easily to
get their desired results. In the rest of this paper, we are to
address these point-by-point.

Benchmark dataset
To make the description simpler and cleaner, the
Chou’s sequential scheme, which had been used by many
previous investigators for analyzing the enzyme specificity
[55], signal peptide cleavage sites [56], nitrotyrosine sites
[16, 57], hydroxyproline or hydroxylysine sites [50, 58],
methylation sites [34, 39, 59], protein-protein interaction
[32], protein-protein binding sites [60, 61], carbonylation
sites [48], and phosphorylation sites [51], was adopted in
this study. According to Chou’s scheme, a potential RNA
m5C modificationsite sample can be generally expressed
by
R ξ () = N − ξ N − ( ξ −1)  N −2 N −1 N +1 N +2  N + ( ξ −1) N + ξ  (2)
where the center symbol  denotes the single nucleic
acid code cytosine (C), the subscript ξ is an integer,
N −ξ represents the ξ -th upstream nucleotide from
the center, the N +ξ denotes the ξ -th downstream
nucleotide, and so forth. The (2ξ + 1) -tuple RNA sample
R ξ () can be further classified into the following two
categories:
 +
R ξ (  ) ∈  R ξ (  ) ,
R ξ− (  ) ,

(3)

where R ξ+ (  ) represents a true m 5C sample with C at its
center, R ξ− (  ) a false one with C at its center, and the
symbol ∈ means “a member of” in the set theory.
In literature the benchmark dataset usually consists
of a training dataset and a testing dataset: the former is
for training a model, while the latter for testing it. But
as elucidated in a comprehensive review [62], there is no
need to artificially separate a benchmark dataset into the
two parts if the prediction model is tested by the jackknife
or subsampling (K-fold) cross-validation because the
outcome thus obtained is actually from a combination
of many different independent dataset tests. Thus, the

respectively (see Eq.3); while ∪ denotes the symbol of
“union” in the set theory [62].
The benchmark dataset used in this study was
derived from RMBase [1], which is a resource for
decoding the landscape of RNA modifications from highthroughput sequencing data. The detailed procedures
are as follows. (1) The genomic sequences downloaded
from RMBase [63] are in the form of DNA; to make the
entire description of this paper in a coherent manner,
we first change the code T to U for all the genomic
sequences taken from RMBase and make them become
RNA sequences. (2) As done in [64], by sliding the
( 2ξ + 1) -tuple nucleotide window along each of the RNA
sequences thus obtained, collected were only those RNA
segments with  = C at the center. (3) If the upstream
or downstream in a RNA sequence was less than ξ or
greater than L − ξ where L is the length of the RNA
sequence concerned, the lacking code was filled with the
same code of its nearest neighbor. (4) The RNA segment
samples thus obtained were put into the positive subset
 ξ+ if their centers were experimentally annotated as the
m 5C sites; otherwise, into the negative subset  ξ− . (5)
To reduce redundancy and bias, none of included RNA
segments had pairwise sequence identity with any other in
a same subset. By strictly following the above procedures,
we obtained an array of benchmark datasets with different
ξ values, and hence different lengths of RNA samples as
well (see Eq.2), as illustrated below

Sample formulation
An RNA samples in the aforementioned benchmark
dataset can be generally expressed as
R = N1 N 2  N19 CN 21  N 41 

where N1 represents the 1st nucleotide of the RNA sample
at its sequence position 1, N 2 the 2nd nucleotide at its
position 2, and so forth. Except for N 20 = C , they can be
any of the four nucleotides; i.e.,
Ni ∈ {A (adenine) C (cytosine) G (guanine) U (uracil)}



(7)

Based on the sequential model of Eq.6, one could
directly utilize BLAST to perform statistical analysis.
Unfortunately, this kind of straightforward and intuitive
approach failed to work when a query RNA sample did not
have significant similarity to any of the character-known
RNA sequences. To overcome this problem, investigators
have shifted their focus to the discrete or vector model.
The reason of doing so is also due to the fact that nearly
all the existing machine-learning aorithms can be directly
used to handle vector models but not sequences, as
elaborated in [45].
One of the well-known vector models for DNA/
RNA sequences is the k-tuple nucleotide (or k-mers)
composition; i.e.,

R =  f1k



where f i represents the normalized occurrence frequency
of the i-th k-mer, and the symbol T is the transpose
operator.
When k = 1 , Eq.8 reduces to

(5)

T

R = [ f ( A ) f ( C ) f ( G ) f ( U )]T =  f11 f 21 f 31 f 41  



But it was observed via preliminary tests that when
ξ = 20 (i.e., the RNA samples formed by 41 nucleotides),
the corresponding results were most promising. In other
words, we observed a turning point for the success rates
at ξ = 20 . After this point, the success rates would
become going down with the increase of such parameter.
Accordingly, hereafter we only consider the 41-tuple
nucleotide samples without explicitly mentioning the
parameter ξ any more.

where f11 , f 21 , f31 and f 41 are the normalized occurrence

37, 40, 48, 50-52, 60, 61, 81-84]). The essence of RF is
to compare each individual classifier as a tree, and the
combination of many such classifiers as a forest. In this
study, 100 trees were used for the forest, and dimension
of the random subspace was 22. Each tree in the forest
is trained with different part of the benchmark dataset,
and hence may yield a different result. The final outcome
is determined via a vote from all the trees. For more
information about RF, see [85] where a very detailed
description has been given, and hence there is no need to
repeat here.
The final predictor obtained via the aforementioned
procedures is called as iRNAm5C-PseDNC, where
“i” stands for “identify”, and “RNAm5C” for “RNA
5-methylcytosine modification sites”, and “PseDNC” for
“pseudo dinucleotide composition”.

where f12 is the normalized occurrence frequencies of AA
in the RNA sequence, f 22 is that AC, f32 is that AG, f 42 is
that AU, and so forth.
As we can see from above, the vector’s dimension
will rapidly increase with the k value, causing the so-called
“high-dimension disaster” [65] or overfitting problem.
This will significantly reduce the deviation tolerance or
cluster-tolerant capacity [66], and make the prediction
model contain a lot of noise and very unstable.
Therefore, the k-mers approach is useful only
when the value of k is very small. In other words, it
can only be used to incorporate the local or short-range
or local sequence-order information, but certainly not
the long-range or global sequence-order information.
To approximately cover the long-range sequence-order
effects, one popular and well-known method is to use
the pseudo components that were originally introduced
in dealing with protein/peptide sequences [67–73] and
recently extended to deal with DNA/RNA sequences [911, 34, 74-80].
According to the concept of pseudo components, the
RNA sequence can be generally formulated by [11, 54]
R = [ Ψ1 Ψ2  Ψu  ΨΩ ]

T



Test procedure
One of the important procedures [54] in developing
a new prediction method is how to objectively evaluate
its anticipated success rate [54]. To address this, we
need to consider two issues. (1) What metrics should be
used to quantitatively reflect the predictor’s quality? (2)
What kind of test approach should be utilized to score the
metrics?

(11)

where the subscript Ω is integer and its value as well as
the components Ψu (u = 1, 2, , Ω) will depend on how to
extract the desired information from the RNA sequence
of Eq.6.
In this study, we used the approach called “physicalchemical property matrix combined with auto/crosscovariance” proposed by Liu et al. [39] to define the
components in Eq.7. According to that approach, the
vector components in Eq.7 are given by


(1 ≤ u ≤ 10λ )

Ψu = AC ( m, λ )
CC ( µ1 , µ 2 , λ ) (10λ + 1 ≤ u ≤ 90λ = Ω)

Metrics formulation
The following metrics are generally used to measure
the prediction quality from four different angles: (1) Acc
for measuring the overall accuracy of a predictor, (2)
MCC for its stability, (3) Sn for its sensitivity, and (4) Sp
for its specificity [86]. Unfortunately, their conventional
formulations as given in [86] lack intuitiveness and most
experimental scientists feel difficult to understand them,
particularly for the MCC. Interestingly, using the Chou’s
symbols introduced in studying signal peptides [56], Xu
et al. [13] and Chen et al. [12] converted them into a set of
four intuitive equations, as given by

(12)

(m = 1, 2, ,10; µ1 , µ 2 = 1, 2, ,10; µ1 ≠ µ 2 )
where λ is an integer within the range from 0 to 39.
Using exactly the same calculation approach as elaborated
in [39], we found that λ = 5 was optimal choice for the
current study. As for how to calculate the concrete values
in Eq.12, see ref. [39] where a crystal clear description
had been given and hence there is no need to repeat here.

Random forest algorithm



Being a powerful algorithm, the random forest (RF)
has been increasingly used to analyze various different
problems in computational biology (see, e.g. [32, 36,

where N represents the total number of the true m5C
sites investigated, while N −+ is the number of the true
m5C sites incorrectly predicted to be of false m5C site;

subsampling tests can be completely avoided because
the outcome obtained by the jackknife cross-validation is
always unique for a given benchmark dataset.

N − is the total number of the false m5C sites investigated,
while N +− is the number of the false m5C sites incorrectly
predicted to be of true m5C site.
According to Eq.13, it is crystal clear to see the
following. When N −+ = 0 meaning none of the true m5C
sites are incorrectly predicted to be of false m5C site, we
have the sensitivity Sn = 1 . When N −+ = N + meaning that
all the true m5C sites are incorrectly predicted to be of false
m5C site, we have the sensitivity Sn = 0 . Likewise, when
N +− = 0 meaning none of the false m5C sites are incorrectly
predicted to be of m5C site, we have the specificity Sp = 1 ;
whereas N +− = N − meaning that all the false m5C sites
are incorrectly predicted to be of true m5C sites, we have
the specificity Sp = 0 . When N −+ = N +− = 0 meaning that
none of true m5C sites in the positive dataset and none of
the false m5C sites in the negative dataset are incorrectly
predicted, we have the overall accuracy Acc = 1 and
MCC = 1 ; when N −+ = N + and N +− = N − meaning that
all the true m5C sites in the positive dataset and all the
false m5C sites in the negative dataset are incorrectly
predicted, we have the overall accuracy Acc = 0 and
MCC = −1; whereas when N −+ = N + / 2 and N +− = N − / 2
we have Acc = 0.5 and MCC = 0 meaning no better than
random guess. Therefore, Eq.13 has made the meanings
of sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and stability
much more intuitive and easier-to-understand, particularly
for the meaning of MCC, as concurred recently by many
investigators (see, e.g., [18, 20, 31-35, 47-52, 60, 75-77,
84, 87-92]).
Note that, however, the set of equations defined in
Eq.13 is valid only for the single-label systems. For the
multi-label systems whose emergence has become more
frequent in system biology [93–95] and system medicine
[96] or biomedicine [40], a completely different set of
metrics are needed as elaborated in [97].

Now let us discuss what kind of test method should
be used to score the four metrics in Eq.13. In statistical
analysis, the following three methods are often used to test
a predictor: (1) independent dataset test, (2) subsampling
(or K-fold cross-validation) test, and (3) jackknife test
[98]. Of these three, however, the jackknife test is deemed
the least arbitrary that can always yield a unique outcome
for a given benchmark dataset as elucidated in [54].
Accordingly, the jackknife test has been widely recognized
and increasingly used by investigators to examine the
quality of various predictors (see, e.g., [15, 99–108]).
Accordingly, here we also used the jackknife test
to check the quality of iRNAm5C-PseDNC predictor.
During the jackknifing process, both the training dataset
and testing dataset are actually open, and each sample
will be in turn moved between the two. The jackknife test
can exclude the “memory” effect. Also, the arbitrariness
