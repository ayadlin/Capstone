ABSTRACT
Dysregulation of cellular transcription and translation is a fundamental hallmark
of cancer. As CDK9 and Mnks play pivotal roles in the regulation of RNA transcription
and protein synthesis, respectively, they are important targets for drug development.
We herein report the cellular mechanism of a novel CDK9 inhibitor CDKI-73 in an
ovarian cancer cell line (A2780). We also used shRNA-mediated CDK9 knockdown
to investigate the importance of CDK9 in the maintenance of A2780 cells. This study
revealed that CDKI-73 rapidly inhibited cellular CDK9 kinase activity and downregulated the RNAPII phosphorylation. This subsequently caused a decrease in the
eIF4E phosphorylation by blocking Mnk1 kinase activity. Consistently, CDK9 shRNA
was also found to down-regulate the Mnk1 expression. Both CDKI-73 and CDK9 shRNA
decreased anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 and induced apoptosis. The study
confirmed that CDK9 is required for cell survival and that ovarian cancer may be
susceptible to CDK9 inhibition strategy. The data also implied a role of CDK9 in eIF4Emediated translational control, suggesting that CDK9 may have important implication
in the Mnk-eIF4E axis, the key determinants of PI3K/Akt/mTOR- and Ras/Raf/MAPKmediated tumorigenic activity. As such, CDK9 inhibitor drug candidate CDKI-73 should
have a major impact on these pathways in human cancers.

INTRODUCTION

for normal proliferation, development and homeostasis.
CDK4/cyclin D, CDK6/cyclin D and CDK2/cyclin
E facilitate the G1-S phase transition by sequentially
phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), while
CDK1/cyclin A, CDK2/cyclin A and CDK1/cyclin B are
essential for S-phase progression and G2-M transition,
respectively [1].
Inhibition of transcriptional CDKs as an effective
anti-cancer strategy has gained considerable attention
following the observation that many types of cancer cells

Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family
of serine/threonine kinases, whose activity is tightly
associated with specific cyclin co-factors. Over the last
decade, more than 20 CDKs have been characterized and
are generally classified into two major groups, based on
whether their primary role is involved in the control of
cell cycle progression or the regulation of transcription.
Multiple CDKs control the cell cycle and are essential

rely on the production of short-lived mitotic regulatory
kinases and apoptosis regulators such as Mcl-1 for
their survival [2, 3]. CDK7/cyclin H is a component of
transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) that phosphorylates
the serine-5 residues within the heptad repeats of RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD) to
initiate transcription [4, 5]. CDK9/cyclin T, the catalytic
subunit of positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb
[6, 7], phosphorylates two elongation repressors, i.e. the
DRB-sensitive-inducing factor (DSIF) and the negative
elongation factor (NELF), and serine-2 of the CTD heptad
repeats to facilitate a productive transcription elongation
[3, 8]. Apart from having a role in RNA transcription,
CDK7 is also a CDK-activating kinase (CAK), which
phosphorylates and activates multiple cell cycle CDKs [5].
In contrast, CDK9 appears to have a minimal effect on cell
cycle regulation [9].
Over the last decade, an intensive search for
pharmacological CDK inhibitors has led to the
development of several clinical candidates and to the
realization that inhibition of the transcriptional CDKs
underlies their anti-tumor activity [3, 10]. Flavopiridol
(alvocidib), the first CDK inhibitor to enter clinical trials,
is the most potent CDK9 inhibitor identified to date and
has demonstrated marked anti-tumor activity in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [11, 12]. Flavopiridol has
been shown to inhibit multiple CDKs [13] and other
kinases [14], but the primary mechanism responsible for
its observed anti-tumor activity in CLL appeared to be the
CDK9-mediated down-regulation of transcription of antiapoptotic proteins [15].
R-Roscovitine (seliciclib) is the first orally
bioavailable CDK inhibitor that targets CDK2, CDK7
and CDK9 (IC50 = 0.1, 0.5 and 0.8 µM, respectively)
[16-18]. Initial evaluation in clinical trials indicated its
well tolerance and some evidence of disease stabilization
was reported [10]. Phase-II clinical trials are currently
underway in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma.
R-Roscovitine has demonstrated selective induction of
apoptosis in cancer cells by down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins through transcriptional CDK inhibition
[19, 20]. Other CDK inhibitors, including AZD5438 [21],
R547 [22, 23] and AT519 [24], have also been evaluating
in clinical trials.
Recently, the first-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor PD
0332991 [25, 26] (palbociclib) has demonstrated marked
anti-tumor activity in post-menopausal women with
estrogen-receptor positive and HER2-negative advanced
breast cancer. However, non-luminal/basal subtypes were
resistant to PD 0332991. Cell cycle analysis showed G0/
G1 arrest in sensitive cell lines and Western blot analysis
demonstrated that retinoblastoma phosphorylation
(pRb) is blocked in sensitive, but not resistant lines.
Hyperphosphorylation of Rb is mediated by CDK4 and
CDK6 in early G1 phase through the interaction with
cyclin D. This results in Rb inactivation and release of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transcription factors that allows cells progress toward
S phase. PD 0332991 showed significant hematologic
toxicity and dose reduction for hematologic toxicity was
required for 24% of patients in clinical trials [27].
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)interacting kinases (Mnks) are also members of the
serine/threonine kinase family, and are emerging anticancer targets [28]. As one of the key effectors for the
MAPK pathways, Mnks are activated by the extracellular
signal-related kinase (Erk) and p38 kinase in response to
extracellular stimuli. Subsequently, Mnks phosphorylate
residue serine-209 of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E), a key component of translational control [29].
Recent findings suggested that eIF4E is a key determinant
of PI3K/Akt/mTOR- and Ras/Raf/MAPK-mediated
tumorigenic activity, and that targeting eIF4E should
have a major impact on these pathways in human cancers
[29]. Phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnks at serine-209 is
considered to be critical for the oncogenic role of eIF4E.
It has demonstrated that mice carrying a serine-209Ala
eIF4E mutant were incapable of developing cancer.
While Mnk1/2-double knock-out tPTEN-/- mice showed
diminished tumour growth compared to the parental
tPTEN-/- mice. Significantly, the kinase activity of Mnks
seemed not to be essential for normal growth [30, 31]. As
such, Mnks have emerged as potential effective and low
toxicity targets for cancer therapy.
We have previously described a novel CDK9
inhibitor, CDKI-73, as a targeted therapeutic agent for
the treatment CLL [32]. CDKI-73 is highly cytotoxic to
primary leukemia cells derived from CLL patients (mean
LD50 = 0.08 µM) and showed >500-fold selectivity for
primary leukemia cells over normal B-lymphocytes (LD50
= 40.5 µM). Significantly, CDKI-73 retained efficacy
in primary CLL samples derived from poor prognostic
subsets including those who had p53 mutation/deletion
and those who had relapsed following fludarabinebased regimens. The synergistic effect of CDKI-73 with
fludarabine was established at a molar ratio of 1:100, and
the synergy mechanism was associated with CDKI-73mediated transcriptional inhibition of Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and
XIAP. The study has provided compelling evidence that
CDKI-73 represents a promising therapeutic strategy as
a single-target agent as well as combination therapeutics
with fludarabine for the treatment of CLL and fludarabinerelapsed diseases.
In the present study, we further evaluated the effects
of CDKI-73 on human ovarian cancer cells. Ovarian
cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer;
new and more effective treatments are urgently required.
Screening against a panel of 24 human cancer cell lines
showed that CDKI-73 was most cytotoxic against A2780
ovarian cancer cells. We herein report that CDKI-73
targets both CDK9- and eIF4E-related pathways and
it may serve as an effective therapeutic agent for the
treatment of ovarian cancer, as well as a range of other

cancers.

We firstly assessed the effects of CDKI-73 on cell
viability against a panel of 24 human solid tumor and
hematological cancer cell lines using MTT and resazurin
assays. The relevant half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values are summarized in Table 1. CDKI-73 has
exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities against all
tumor cell lines tested with IC50 values ranging from 0.007
to 0.573 μM following a 72 h of exposure. CDKI-73 was
most potent in A2780 ovarian cancer cells with an IC50 =
0.007 μM.
We next carried out time-course proliferation
assays with CDKI-73 in A2780 cells compared with that
of flavopiridol (Table 2). CDKI-73 inhibited the growth
of tumor cells at early time-points, i.e. 24 h, with an IC50
value of 0.033 µM; similar to flavopiridol (IC50 = 0.049
µM). Prolonged exposure to CDKI-73 (i.e. 72 h) caused
a significant reduced cell viability; showing a >5-fold
higher potency than flavopiridol. CGP57380, a known
Mnk inhibitor [28, 29], was included in the study as a
comparator agent with targeted effects on the Mnk-eIF4E
pathway. CGP57380 was significantly less active in
inhibiting A2780 tumor growth (IC50 ≥5 µM) than CDKI73.

RESULTS
CDKI-73 exhibits broad spectrum anti-cancer
activity
CDKI-73, a heterocyclic 3-(5-fluoro-4-(4-methyl2-(methylamino)thiazol-5-yl)pyrimidin-2-ylamino)
benzenesulfonamide, was rationally designed and
optimized using CDK9 protein structure-guided approach
[33]. X-ray crystallographic analysis confirmed that
CDKI-73 analogs targeted CDK9 in an ATP-dependent
manner [34]. CDKI-73 is one of the most potent CDK9
inhibitors identified to date [32, 33]. However, it also
inhibits CDK1, CDK2 and CDK7 in the low nM range in
biochemical kinase assays.

CDK9 shRNA confirms the target specificity of
CDKI-73
To investigate the importance of CDK9 expression
in A2780 cells and to assess the target specificity of CDKI73, we silenced CDK9 expression using a lentivirusmediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy [32]. A

Time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and (B) Western blot. (*) indicates p ≤ 0.05 compared to A2780 untransfected cells.

stable knockdown of CDK9 was achieved to ~90% when
compared to non-genetic modified A2780 cells in mRNA
transcription (Figure 1A) and protein expression (Figure
1B). These results confirmed the successful knockdown
of CDK9 in A2780 cells.
CDK9 knockdown (CDK9KD) A2780 cells have
demonstrated significant resistance to CDKI-73. After
treatment of CDK9KD cells with CDKI-73 for a period
of 24 h, no cytotoxic effect was observed (IC50 >10
µM). Following treatment for 48 h and 72 h, CDKI-73
caused cell death, but revealed >98- and >50-fold reduced
potency, respectively, compared to CDKI-73 in A2780
parental cells (Table 2), confirming CDK9 targeting
specificity of CDKI-73. CDK9KD A2780 cells also
showed reduced sensitivity towards flavopiridol at 24 h

treatment period, but the cells regained sensitivity by 48
and 72 hours, suggesting off-target effects of flavopiridol
[13].

CDKI-73 activates caspase-3/7 and induces
apoptosis
To investigate whether apoptosis was the relevant
mode of action observed in the viability assay, we
measured the activity of caspase-3/7 in A2780 cells after
exposure to CDKI-73 or flavopiridol for a period of 24 h.
As shown in Figure 3A, 0.02 μM CDKI-73 significantly
increased caspase-3/7 activity in A2780 cells and in a
dose-dependent manner. Induction of the same level of

following treatment with CDKI-73 or flavopiridol for 24 h. Dose-dependent activation of caspase-3/7 was observed in A2780 cells starting
from 0.02 µM CDKI-73 and 0.06 µM flavopiridol. Vertical bars represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Values
significantly different from the untreated samples are marked with an asterisk (*) (p ≤ 0.05). (B) shRNA-mediated CDK9 knockdown and

observed with CDKI-73- or flavopiridol-treated cells at 0.02 μM, the concentration causing a significant caspase-3/7 activation; at a higher
concentration, i.e. 0.25 μM CDKI-73 or flavopiridol induced the significant numbers of sub-G1 cells, indicating cell death. The shRNA
CDK9KD cells also showed no cell cycle disturbance.

caspase-3/7 requires 0.06 µM flavopiridol, consistent
with its lower potency compared to CDKI-73 in the
cytotoxicity assay.

Induction of apoptosis in A2780 cells by either
shRNA-mediated CDK9 knockdown or pharmacological
inhibitors was further confirmed by annexin-V/propidium

Figure 4: Mechanistic investigation of the molecular effects by Western blotting and RT-qPCR analysis. (A) A2780 cells
were treated with CDKI-73, flavopiridol or CGP57380 for 1 h. CDKI-73 and flavopiridol reduced phosphorylation of RNAPII at serine-2
at 0.06 and 0.25 µM, respectively, while CGP57380 only affected the phosphorylation of eIF4E (p-eIF4ES209) via inhibition of Mnk1. (B)
After 24 h drug exposure, CDKI-73 or flavopiridol also abolished p-eIF4ES209 at 0.25 µM, indicating cellular inhibition of Mnk kinase
activity. The same treatment with CDKI-73 or flavopiridol caused a loss in Mnk1 protein expression. CGP57380-treated cells abrogated
p-RNAPIIS2 as well as p-eIF4ES209 with a minimal effect on Mnk1 protein level. (C) 0.25 µM CDKI-73 or flavopiridol caused little changes
in the phosphorylation of Erk and p38 MAPK; however, inhibited the 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (p-4E-BP1Thr70) by 24 h. CGP57380 had a
minimal effect on these proteins. (D) At 0.25 µM, CDKI-73 or flavopiridol suppressed the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and
Bcl-2, leading to caspase-3/7 activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, MDM2 protein level was reduced and this was accompanied by
the up-regulation of p53. CGP57380 reduced Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins at a concentration of 20 µM, but caused little alterations in caspase-3
activity and PARP cleavage, indicating a minimal apoptotic effect. DMSO diluent was used as a control in each experiment and β-actin was
used as an internal loading control. A representative blot is selected from at least two independent repeats of experiments. The expression of
mRNA encoding Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Mnk1 were reduced by (E) CDKI-73 and (F) Flavopiridol in A2780 cells after treatment for 4 h starting
at a concentration of 0.06 μM in a dose-dependent manner. (G) CGP57380 showed a minimal effect on these transcripts. Actin mRNA was
used as a reference sequence.

iodide (PI) dual staining following treatment of cells for
a period of 48 h (Figure 3B). ShRNA-mediated CDK9
inhibition caused 59% apoptosis, as indicated by the
annexin-V positive and PI negative (annexin-V+/PI-)
cells. Similarly, treatment of A2780 cells with CDKI-73
or flavopiridol at 0.25 µM resulted in > 48% increase
in annexin-V+/PI- cells when compared to untreated
cells. Taken together, these results confirmed that A2780
cells are dependent on CDK9 activity for survival and
inhibition of CDK9 activity by either genetic knockdown
or pharmacological inhibitor promotes cellular apoptosis.
As CDKI-73 was shown to inhibit CDK1 and
CDK2 by in vitro kinase assays [32], we investigated the
cell cycle effect of CDKI-73 on A2780 cells compared

to that of CDK9KD cells. As shown in Figure 3C, no
significant difference in the cell cycle profiles was
observed in CDK9KD A2780 cells compared to the
transfection controls (i.e. empty vector and scramble)
and untransfected cells, confirming a lack of influence
of CDK9 on cell cycle. Similarly, no cell cycle effect
was observed with A2780 cells after exposure to 0.02
µM CDKI-73 for 24 h, despite the fact that the same
conditions have given rise to a significant caspase-3/7
activity in the cells (Figure 3A). At a higher concentration,
i.e. 0.25 µM, CDKI-73 induced substantial sub-G1 events,
an indicative of cell death. Flavopiridol showed similar
cell cycle profiles to CDKI-73.

Figure 5: Mechanism of action of CDKI-73 in A2780 cells compared to shRNA-mediated CDK9KD in A2780 cells. (A)

Western blotting analysis showed the reduced levels of CDK9 protein and p-RNAPIIS2 in CDK9 shRNA KD A2780 cells. Down-regulation
of p-eIF4ES209 by shRNA-mediated CDK9KD indicated Mnk1 inhibition. Like CDK9 shRNA, CDKI-73 caused the loss of p-RNAPIIS2 and
p-eIF4ES209 in A2780 cells. Unlike CDK9 shRNA, CDKI-73-treated cells showed a reduced p-RNAPIIS5, indicating CDK7 inhibition at
0.25 µM. (B) Knockdown of CDK9 reduced the phosphorylation of Erk, p38 and 4E-BP1, suggesting a role of CDK9 in MAPK cascade and
mTOR-eIF4E pathway. CDKI-73 had little effects on Erk and p38 MAPK and their phosphorylated forms. Like CDK9 shRNA, however,
CDKI-73 inhibited the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. (C) Knockdown of CDK9 suppressed Bcl-2, Mcl-1 (~ 40 kDa), procaspase-3/7 and
PARP. CDKI-73-treated cells decreased Mcl-1, Bcl-2, procaspase-3/7 protein levels and induced cleaved PARP. DMSO diluent was used
as a control in each experiment and β-actin was used as an internal loading control. A representative blot is selected from at least two
independent repeats of experiments.

CDKI-73 down-regulates the phosphorylation of
RNAPII and eIF4E

We further examined the changes of anti-apoptotic
and onco-proteins including Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and cyclin
D1, which are regulated by CDK9- and eIF4E-mediated
transcription and translation, respectively [3, 29]. The
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2
was significantly reduced in A2780 cells after treatment
with 0.25 μM CDKI-73 or flavopiridol, as well as 20 μM
CGP57380 (Figure 4D). The treatment with CDKI-73 or
flavopiridol also suppressed cyclin D1 protein expression.
The loss in procaspase-3 and -7, together with the increase
in cleaved PARP confirmed the induction of apoptosis
by CDKI-73. Being consistent with previous studies
of CDK9 inhibitors [13, 36], CDKI-73 increased p53
protein expression concomitantly with down-regulation
of MDM2, a short-lived protein responsible for p53
degradation. Taken together, CDKI-73 demonstrated
potent CDK9 inhibition as well as, the ability to block
the eIF4E pathway by suppressing Mnk and 4E-BP1
activities. This resulted in the reduction of Mcl-1 and
Bcl-2 and promoted caspase-3/7-dependent apoptosis in
A2780 cells.

We next investigated the effect of CDKI-73 on
protein expression using Western blotting. A2780 cells
were incubated with CDKI-73 for 1 h. The level of
the phosphorylated RNAPII at serine-2 (p-RNAPIIS2,
Figure 4A) was suppressed, starting from 0.06 μM in
a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the level of the
phosphorylated serine-5 of CTD RNAPII (p-RNAPIIS5),
and the proteins involved in the Mnk-eIF4E axis were not
affected, indicating that CDK9 is the primary target for
CDKI-73. Flavopiridol also reduced CDK9 activity, but
this was only evident at a higher concentration (i.e. 0.25
µM). CGP57380 demonstrated potent anti-Mnk activity
by blockage of eIF4E phosphorylation at serine-209
(p-eIF4ES209) at 5µM. This compound had little effect on
CDK9 and CDK7 kinase activity following 1 h-treatment.
By extending the treatment to 24 h, both CDKI-73
and flavopiridol abolished phosphorylation at serine-2
and serine-5 of RNAPII at 0.25 µM, indicative of their
cellular CDK9 and CDK7 inhibitory activities (Figure
4B). Interestingly, both compounds were capable of
blocking the Mnk-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation at
the serine-209 at the same concentration. Expectedly,
CGP57380 inhibited the level of p-eIF4ES209 at 5 µM.
However, it was surprising that CGP57380 also caused a
loss in the phosphorylation of RNAPII (p-RNAPIIS2). No
changes in the levels of total RNAPII and eIF4E proteins
were detected in cells treated with compounds. However,
the level of Mnk1 expression was reduced by 0.25 µM
CDKI-73 or flavopiridol. These observations suggested
that CDKI-73 (or flavopiridol) might also target the
proteins involved in the eIF4E-mediated translation in
cancer cells.
To assess whether CDKI-73 affected the MAPK
and mTOR pathways, we examined their respective
upstream protein expression and kinase activities. Mnk1
kinase activity is known to be regulated by p38 MAPK
and Erk through phosphorylation at Thr197 and Thr202,
respectively [35]. p38 MAPK is activated by MKK3/6
through phosphorylation at its Thr180 and Tyr182
residues, wheras Erk is phosphorylated by MEK1 at
Thr202 and Tyr204 residues. Western blotting analysis
of A2780 cells following exposure to compounds for 24
h revealed that, as shown in Figure 4C, neither CDKI73 nor flavopiridol had any effect on the Erk and p38
MAPK pathways; no significant change in the levels of
phosphorylated Erk (i.e. p-ErkT202/ T204), and p38 MAPK
(i.e. p-p38T180/Y182) was detected, indicating their Mnk
selectivity profile. However, the phosphorylation of eIF4E
binding protein (4E-BP1) at Thr70, i.e. p-4E-BP1T70, was
blocked by 0.25 µM CDKI-73 and flavopiridol (Figure
4C). A reduction of 4E-BP1 protein was also observed.
CGP57380 inhibited p38 phosphorylation, but showed a
minimal effect on 4E-BP1.

CDK9 inhibition causes the down-regulation of
Mnk1
To determine whether there is any inter-dependence
between mRNA transcription and eIF4E translation, we
examined the transcription of Mnk1, as well as Bcl-2 and
Mcl-1 in A2780 cells. After 4 h treatment with CDKI73 (Figure 4E) or flavopiridol (Figure 4F), the mRNA
levels of all three genes were reduced in a dose-dependent
manner. In contrast, CGP57380 showed a minimal effect
on these transcripts (Figure 4G), suggesting the CDK9mediated transcriptional inhibition of Mnk1, Mcl-1 and
Bcl-2. The effects on CDK9 and Mnk-eIF4E pathways
were further examined in the CDK9KD A2780 cells
in comparison with CDKI-73-treated A2780 cells. As
expected, down-regulation of CDK9 protein, its kinase
activity (i.e. p-RNAPIIS2), and RNAPII was observed in
the CDK9KD cells (Figure 5A). Significantly, shRNAmediated CDK9 inhibition also caused down-regulation
of Mnk1 expression, resulting in a loss of eIF4E
phosphorylation at serine-209, consistent with the CDK9Mnk targeting mechanism of CDKI-73. Furthermore,
the CDK9 knockdown caused loss in the levels of
phosphorylated Erk, p38 and 4E-BP1 (Figure 5B). A
slight reduction in p38 and 4E-BP1 protein expression
was also observed. In contrast, other than the abrogated
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, CDKI-73 had little effect on
the levels of other proteins examined. Ribosomal protein
S6 (rpS6) and its phosphorylation (i.e. p-S6S240/S244) were
not affected by either shRNA-mediated CDK9KD or
CDKI-73. Induction of apoptosis by CDK9 shRNA was
also associated with the loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, the
induction of caspase-3/7 activity and PARP cleavage.

DISCUSSION

substantial cell death (i.e. sub-G1, Figure 3C).
In line with our previous findings [32, 33], CDKI73 inhibits cellular CDK9-mediated RNAPII transcription.
Western blotting of A2780 cells after exposure to 0.06
µM CDKI-73 for 1 h reduced the phosphorylation CTD
RNAPII at serine-2 (Figure 4A). In addition to targeting
CDK9; and CDK7 to a lesser extent, CDKI-73 has shown
to decrease the phosphorylation of eIF4E. As shown in
Figure 5A, the combined suppression of p-RNAPIIS2 and
p-eIF4ES209 were observed in the CDK9 shRNA KD cells,
consistent with those shown in CDKI-73-treated cells
and suggesting a role of CDK9 in the Mnk-eIF4E axis.
The reduced mRNA transcript for Mnk1 as in Figure 5E
further confirm that CDKI-73 inhibit Mnk-eIF4E axis
through CDK9 transcriptional inhibition. Intriguingly,
CGP57380 was shown to suppress the phosphorylation of
RNAPII at serine-2. CGP57380 is known to target CK1
with an IC50 = 0.51 μM in a biochemical assay [40]. It has
been shown that CK1 activity is required for activation of
heat shock proteins (Hsps) 70 and 90 [43], which in turn
stabilize CDK9 binding to cyclin T1 leading to productive
mRNA transcription [44]. Therefore, it is likely that the
suppression of p-RNAPIIS2 by CGP57380 may through its
off-target CK1-Hsp inhibitory mechanism.
To further assess whether down-regulation of CDK9
by shRNA affected Mnk up-steam activating kinases,
we examined Erk and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in
CDK9KD cells, both were abrogated. In contrast, CDKI73 (or flavopiridol) caused little changes in these proteins
(Figures 4C and 5B). It is not understood why CDK9
knockdown should cause the de-phosphorylation of
Erk and p38; nevertheless suggesting a role of RNAPII
in transcriptional regulation of Erk and p38 upstream
modules. It is worth noting that the shRNA-mediated
CDK9 inhibition silences the gene expression of CDK9
and hence shutting off the protein synthesis in the cells,
whereas pharmacological inhibitor CDKI-73 blocked only
the kinase activity of CDK9 without affecting the protein
expression. The difference has important implications; for
instance, CDK9 knockdown causes alternation not only
in a range of mRNA transcripts, but also in the proteins
that interact with their binding partners or assemble into
macromolecular complexes.
Mcl-1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining
mitochondrial outer membrane permeability. CDKI73 or CDK9 shRNA showed a significant apoptotic
effect (Fig 4D and 5C). Reduction in procaspase-3 and
procaspase-7 in CDKI-73-treated A2780 cells indicated
the conversion of their respective procaspases to the active
forms. This was further supported by the increased level
of cleaved PARP. Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 were down-regulated
following the CDK9 inhibition (Figure 4D, 4E and 5C).
Expression of p53 is regulated at the post-translational
level by association with its negative regulator MDM2
[45], a short-lived protein known to be reduced by
CDK9 inhibition [13]. As expected, CDKI-73 elevated

Dysregulations of mRNA transcription and protein
synthesis are common events in human cancers. CDK9
and eIF4E are key regulators in mRNA transcriptional
elongation and translational initiation, respectively. CDK9
inhibition as an effective anti-cancer strategy has gained
strong support in recognizing that cancer cells rely on the
production of short-lived apoptosis regulators and mitotic
regulatory kinases for survival [2, 3]. Our own studies have
also demonstrated that CDK9 inhibitors can achieve anticancer activity with minimal toxicity to non-transformed
cells [13, 32]. Control of mRNA translation plays a critical
role in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Most
mRNAs are translated in a cap-dependent manner. A key
player in the regulation of translation is the mRNA capbinding protein eIF4E, the rate-limiting member of the
eIF4F complex. Overexpression of eIF4E has been found
in a range of human cancers and phosphorylation of eIF4E
by Mnks is responsible for the oncogenic role of eIF4E
[28, 30]. Inhibition of Mnk-mediated eIF4E activity is
believed to have a major impact on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways in human cancers [29, 37].
CDKI-73 is one of the most potent CDK9 inhibitors
identified to date, and has been shown to induce apoptosis
in CLL patient samples with minimal toxicity [32].
CGP57380 is a potent Mnk1 inhibitor (Ki = 0.34 µM) [38],
and has served as a tool compound to reveal the role of
eIF4E in cell biology [39]. CGP57380 also inhibits other
kinases including CK1 (with a similar potency to Mnk1),
BRSK2, MKK1 and Pim3 [40], however it dose not
target CDKs. CGP57380 has been shown to block eIF4E
phosphorylation in HCT-116 and B16 cell lines [41]. To
determine whether targeting the Mnk-eIF4E axis in cancer
cells is an additional mechanism to CDK9 inhibition or a
consequence of CDK9 pathway alteration, we conducted
experiments utilizing shRNA-mediated CDK9 inhibition
to compare with the pharmacological effects of CDKI-73.
Flavopiridol and CGP57380 were used as comparators
for assessments of CDK9 and Mnk1 pharmacological
mechanism, respectively.
Despite the fact that CDKI-73 was highly cytotoxic
to a wide range of tumor cell lines, particularly to A2780
ovarian cancer cells (IC50 = 0.007 µM, Table 1), it had
a reduced potency in the CDK9KD A2780 cells (IC50 =
0.386 – < 10 µM, Table 2). These confirmed the CDK9targeting specificity of CDKI-73, as the down-regulation
of anti-apoptotic proteins in the CDK9 knockdown
cells reduced the sensitivity towards CDK9 inhibitor
[42]. CDKI-73 induced significant caspase-3/7 activity
at 0.02 µM (Figure 3A), and the concentration caused
no cell cycle effect (Figure 2A and 2C), confirming its
CDK9 inhibition mediated apoptosis. CDKI-73 induced
substantial apoptotic populations; resulting in ~48%
apoptotic cells as detected in annexin-V assay (Figure
3B). Cell cycle analysis confirmed that CDKI-73 caused

the level of p53 in concordance with a reduced MDM2.
Flavopiridol showed similar effects on these proteins.
Equally, shRNA-mediated CDK9KD resulted in reduction
of procaspase-3, and in abrogation of procaspase-7, PARP
and Bcl-2 proteins (Figure 5C).
Interestingly, in concordance with the reduction of
Mcl-1 protein (~40 kDa), a smaller species of Mcl-1 (~36
kDa) was detected in the CDK9KD cells. Mcl-1 has been
shown to have a triplet of 36-, 38-, and 40-kDa species,
and the 36-kDa form is more stable compared to other two
larger forms [46]. Structurally, Mcl-1 can be subdivided
into the C-terminal region that shares homology with
other anti-apoptotic family members, and the N-terminal
region which is unstructured. The short half-life of Mcl-1
is thought to reflect the unique features of its N-terminus.
The latter contains two sequences rich in proline, glutamic
acid, serine and threonine residues (so-called the PEST
sequences) that target it for rapid proteasomal degradation
[47, 48]. At least three E3 ubiquitin ligases are thought
to contribute to this rapid turnover, and the ability of E3
ligases to bind and modify Mcl-1 is dependent on the
phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at certain sites within its PEST
sequences. Active Erk has been shown to phosphorylate
the PEST region which stabilizes Mcl-1. However,
the phosphorylation by Erk can also serve as a priming
phosphorylation for the subsequent glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK3)-mediated phosphorylation, which
promotes Mcl-1 ubiquitylation and degradation [49].
Mnks play critical roles in the regulation of protein
synthesis and have emerged as anti-cancer targets [28,
29]. Recent studies have shown that the cytotoxic effects
of Mnk inhibitors were cell-specific [50] and the antiproliferative effects of Mnk inhibitors in some solid tumor
cells seemed primarily cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic
[28]. Despite being a potent Mnk inhibitor, CGP57380
exhibited only modest cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines
[28]. We have shown that CGP57380 was capable of
reducing the levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins (20
µM, 24 h), but failed to activate caspase-3/7 and induce
apoptosis in A2780 cells (Figure 4D). The observations are
in agreement with the study of cycloheximide, a general
translational inhibitor, which induced Mcl-1 protein decay
by inhibiting the translational machinery without affecting
cell apoptosis [51]. These suggest that down-regulation
of Mcl-1 protein expression may be necessary, but not
sufficient for induction of apoptosis, whereas CDK9targeted transcriptional inhibition of Mcl-1 should be more
effective apoptotic strategy in cancer cells.
Over the last decade, selectivity of kinase inhibitors
has been the main focus of drug discovery in an attempt
to reduce drug side-effects and toxicity. However, it
becomes apparent from clinical studies with molecularly
targeted therapy that cancers can escape from a given state
of oncogene addiction through mutations in alternative
pathways because of the frequent genomic instability of
cancers. For this reason, as well as tumor heterogeneity, it
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is unlikely that the use of a single molecular targeted agent
will achieve long-lasting remissions or cures in cancers,
especially for late-stage disease [52]. Co-targeting key
components of oncogenic pathways have recently been
proposed as a more effective strategy for developing
anti-cancer drugs [29]. With the combined inhibition of
CDK9-mediated transcription and Mnk-eIF4E translation,
together with its low toxicity in non-transformed cells and
favourable pharmacological properties manifested [32],
CDKI-73 may offer an opportunity to treat a wide range
of human cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemical compounds
Synthesis of CDKI-73 has previously been
described [33]. Flavopiridol and CGP57380 were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Castle Hill, Australia).
They were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at
a stock concentration of 10 mM, and stored at -20°C in
small aliquots.

Cell culture
A2780 cells were purchased from European
Collection of Cell Culture (ECACC). All leukemia
cell lines were kindly provided by Prof. R. D’Andrea
(University of South Australia). All solid tumor cell
lines were obtained from the cell bank at the Centre for
Drug Discovery and Development, University of South
Australia. All cell lines were maintained under 37oC,
5% CO2, and were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI)-1640 with 10% FBS.

Lentiviral modulation of CDK9 in A2780 cells
Transfection of cells with lentiviral particles
containing CDK9 shRNA and verification of the
percentage of knockdown were performed as previously
reported [32]. Briefly, bacterial glycerol stocks containing
the lentiviral plasmid vector pLKO.1-puro with shRNA
inserts against CDK9, an empty vector or a scrambled
shRNA control were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Poole,
UK). Lentivirus transfected 293T cells were incubated at
37oC for 48h before the resulting lentiviral particles were
harvested by centrifugation and concentrated using the
Clontech Lenti-X concentrator kit (Lonza, Wokingham,
UK). Concentrated virus was then added to A2780 cells
and incubated for 48h. Lentivirus-transduced cells were
then selected by addition of puromycin (1 μg/mL) to the
culture for two weeks. The relative expression of CDK9
was subsequently assessed by RT-qPCR and Western

and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) horseradish
peroxidase conjugated antibodies were obtained from
Dako. Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were
obtained from GE Life Sciences.

Cell viability assay
MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays were performed
in all solid tumor cell lines as reported previously [53].
Compound concentrations required to induce 50 % of
cell viability (IC50) were calculated using non-linear
regression analysis. Resazurin (Sigma Aldrich) assays
were performed in all leukemia cell lines as previously
described [38].

Real Time-Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
RNA extraction was performed using High Pure
RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science, Castle
Hill, Australia). 1 μg RNA was used in a 20 μl reverse
transcription reaction using Transcriptor First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science, Castle
Hill, Australia). RT-qPCR was carried out in duplicate
with cDNA using SYBR Green I dye (Roche Applied
Science, Castle Hill, Australia) and performed using
LightCycler LC96 (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg,
Germany). All primers were purchased from SigmaAldrich (Castle Hill, Australia). Relative quantification
using E-method established by Roche Applied Science
was performed with β-Actin mRNA as reference
sequence and untreated samples as study calibrator.
cDNA samples were amplified using the following
primer pairs with amplification efficiency (E): β-Actin:
5’-ACTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTC-3’ (forward) and
5’-GATGTCCACGTCACACTTC-3’(reverse), E=1.72;

Mnk1: 5’-AAGGCCATTGAGACACTTCG-3’ (forward)
and 5’-CCCAAATGAAATAAAGCTCCTG-3’ (reverse),
E = 1.74.

Caspase-3/7 assay
Activity of caspase-3/7 was measured using the
Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) according to manufacturer instruction
and analyzed using EnVision multi-label plate reader
(PerkinElmer, Beaconsfield, UK).

Cell cycle and detection of apoptosis
A2780 (8 x 104) cells were seeded and incubated
overnight at 37oC, 5% CO2. Followed by the treatment
with compounds, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged
(300 g, 5 min). Cell pellets were collected and fixed with
70% ethanol on ice for 15 min, followed by centrifugation
(300 g, 5 min). The collected pellets were incubated
with staining solution (50 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI),
0.1 mg/mL RNase A, 0.05% Triton X-100) at 37oC for
1 h and analyzed with Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Apoptosis were assessed with
cells collected and processed as described with annexin
V-FITC/PI commercial kit (Becton Dickenson). Samples
were analyzed with Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) within 1 h of staining. Data were
analyzed using Kaluza v1.2 (Beckman Coulter).

Statistical analysis

Western blots

All experiments with statistics were performed
with at least two independent repeats; representative
experiments being selected for figures. Statistical
significance of differences for experiments was determined
using one-way analysis of variance, with a minimal level
of significance at p ≤0.05.

Western blotting was performed either with the
Simple Western assay by Simon (ProteinSimple, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) according to manufacturer instruction
[54] or as previously described [13]. Antibodies used were
