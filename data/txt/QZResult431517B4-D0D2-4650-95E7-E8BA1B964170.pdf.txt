ABSTRACT
Leukemia remains life-threatening despite remarkable advances in chemotherapy.
The poor prognosis and drug resistance are challenging treatment. Novel drugs are
urgently needed. Shikonin, a natural naphthoquinone, has been previously shown
by us to be particularly effective towards various leukemia cell lines compared to
solid tumors. However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood.
Here, we investigated shikonin and 14 derivatives on U937 leukemia cells. Four
derivatives (isobutyrylshikonin, 2-methylbutyrylshikonin, isovalerylshikonin and
β,β-dimethylacrylshikonin) were more active than shikonin. AnnexinV-PI analysis
revealed that shikonins induced apoptosis. Cell cycle G1/S check point regulation and
the transcription factor c-MYC, which plays a vital role in cell cycle regulation and
proliferation, were identified as the most commonly down-regulated mechanisms upon
treatment with shikonins in mRNA microarray hybridizations. Western blotting and
DNA-binding assays confirmed the inhibition of c-MYC expression and transcriptional
activity by shikonins. Reduction of c-MYC expression was closely associated with
deregulated ERK, JNK MAPK and AKT activity, indicating their involvement in shikonintriggered c-MYC inactivation. Molecular docking studies revealed that shikonin and
its derivatives bind to the same DNA-binding domain of c-MYC as the known c-MYC
inhibitors 10058-F4 and 10074-G5. This finding indicates that shikonins bind to
c-MYC. The effect of shikonin on U937 cells was confirmed in other leukemia cell lines
(Jurkat, Molt4, CCRF-CEM, and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000), where shikonin
also inhibited c-MYC expression and influenced phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, and
SAPK/JNK. In summary, inhibition of c-MYC and related pathways represents a novel
mechanism of shikonin and its derivatives to explain their anti-leukemic activity.

INTRODUCTION

to improve clinical outcome and prognosis in leukemia
treatment.
c-MYC heterodimerizes with its activation partner
MAX, which is also a member of bHLH-LZ protein
family, to recognize the specific E-box CACGTG DNA
sequences in the promoters of its target genes. Thereby,
it exerts most of its fundamental biological activities.
A straightforward strategy to inhibit c-MYC functions is
to block its DNA binding activity by either interfering with
c-MYC–MAX dimerization or disrupting the interaction of
transcriptionally active c-MYC–MAX dimers with DNA
[14, 15]. In this context, several small-molecule c-MYC
inhibitors have been identified from large chemical
libraries. For some of them, e.g. 10058-F4 and 10074-G5,
the actual binding modes have been elaborately illustrated
[16, 17]. Another mechanism of c-MYC inactivation
involves the interference of signal transduction pathways
that down-regulate c-MYC expression. Many signaling
pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
AKT, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), regulate c-MYC mRNA expression
and promote c-MYC stability [18, 19]. Marampon
et al demonstrated that the inhibition of the MEK/ERK
pathway dramatically decreased c-MYC expression and
thus inhibited in cancer cell growth [20]. Although several
small molecules have been described as c-MYC inhibitors,
none of them is clinically used as of yet. Therefore, novel
c-MYC-targeting drugs are urgently needed.
Natural products are a valuable resource for
anticancer agents. Previously, we tested the cytotoxicity of
shikonin, a natural naphthoquinone derived from the roots
of the Chinese herb Lithospermum erythrorhizon, Arnebia
euchroma and Onosma paniculata [21–23], on a panel of
tumor cell lines, including both hematopoietic and solid
cancer cell lines [24, 25]. Leukemia cell lines were more
sensitive to shikonin compared to solid tumor cell lines,
especially the acute myelocytic leukemia cell line U937
[25]. However, the exact mechanisms underlying shikonininduced leukemia cell death remain unclear. Therefore, we
investigated the mode of action on leukemia cells in the
present study. The cytotoxic effect and the death mode of
shikonin and 14 derivatives in U937 were first examined.
Subsequent microarray-based gene expression profiling
for shikonin and four most active derivatives indicated
that c-MYC was commonly deregulated. This result was
validated by Western blot analysis and DNA-binding
activity assays. In silico molecular docking revealed that
shikonin and its derivatives bound to c-MYC at the same
pharmacophores as the known c-MYC inhibitors 10058-F4
and 10074-G5 with comparable binding energy. Meanwhile
AKT, and ERK1/2, JNK/MAPK signaling pathways were
also involved in shikonin-induced c-MYC inactivation in
U937 cells. Moreover, the exquisite activity of shikonin in
U937 cells has been confirmed in other acute leukemia cell
lines, implying inhibition of c-MYC as a general mechanism
of shikonin and derivatives towards leukemia cells.

Acute leukemia is a fast-growing clonal malignancy
of the hematopoietic system that typically leads to death
within weeks or months, if left untreated. Based on
the type of white blood cell, it is classified into acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), which together account for
approximately one-third of cancers diagnosed in children
[1]. Despite dramatic improvement in ALL and AML
treatment, acute leukemia remains the most common
cause of cancer-related death in children due to the poor
prognosis for certain high-aggressive groups of leukemia
and drug resistance in relapsed or refractory patients [2, 3].
Therefore, deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms
of leukemia progression is required for the development of
novel anti-leukemia agents [4].
The proto-oncogene c-MYC encodes a basic helixloop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Lz) transcription
factor, which plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation,
metabolism, differentiation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis
by transcription and activation of downstream target
genes [5]. For example, cell cycle progression from the
G0/G1 into the S phase is tightly controlled by c-MYC
by regulating the expression of cyclins, cyclin dependent
kinases (CDK), CDK inhibitors and the pRb-binding
transcription factor E2F [6]. About 50% of both bloodborne and solid tumors over-express c-MYC protein,
which is usually correlated with poor prognosis due
to promoting tumor growth and resistance to drugs [7].
c-MYC deregulation is closely associated to hematopoietic
neoplasia [8, 9]. In fact, the retroviral form, v-myc was
first discovered to cause myelocytomatosis in chicken and
the oncogene was named after this tumor [7]. Later, the
cellular pendant, c-MYC, was found to be translocated in
aggressive Burkitt’s lymphoma. The important role for
c-Myc on leukemogenesis was subsequently confirmed
in animal models. Conditional overexpression c-Myc
in hematopoietic cells in transgenic mice led to the
formation of malignant T-cell lymphomas and acute
myleoid leukemias, which were reverted by inactivation
of the c-MYC transgene [10, 11]. Later on, mounting
evidence has been accumulated showing that the c-MYC
protein is a key player in hematopoiesis and leukemia [9].
Recently, c-MYC is closely correlated to drug resistance in
leukemia cells. Leukemic cell lines resistant to cytarabine
displayed a c-MYC-dependent overexpression of the
natural killer (NK) group 2, member D (NKG2D) ligands
(NKG2DL) UL-16 binding proteins 1–3 (ULBP1-3) [12].
Up-regulated expression of c-MYC in leukemia cells
promoted the colony formation ability and maintained
poor differentiation leading to drug resistance [5]. In
addition, c-MYC contributed to microenvironmentmediated drug resistance in AML [13]. All these studies
speak for the potential of c-MYC as therapeutic target.
Inactivation of c-MYC represents as a novel approach

RESULTS

flow cytometry with annexin V and PI double staining
in U937 cells treated with and without shikonin and four
derivatives in the presence or absence of the specific
necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 and the caspase apoptosisspecific inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. As shown in Figure 2,
pretreatment with Nec-1 reduced necrosis (annexin V-/
PI+) and partly late apoptosis (annexin V+/PI+), but not
early apoptosis (annexin V+/PI-). By contrast, z-VAD-fmk
attenuated early and late apoptosis and resulted in more
cell viability than Nec-1, indicating that low concentrations
of shikonin or its four derivatives mainly induced cell
death by caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, the
most effective inhibition of cell death by shikonin and its
derivatives was achieved by the combination of Nec-1
and z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that necroptosis, as additional
mode of death may also contribute to cell death.

Cytotoxicity of shikonin and derivatives towards
U937 leukemia cells
Previously we reported the sensitivities of a
panel of different cell lines to shikonin and found that
the U937 histiocytic leukemia cell line was the most
sensitive one [25]. Thereby, this cell line was used for
screening the cytotoxicity of shikonin and 14 shikonin
derivatives. The dose-response curves and IC50
values of 72 h treatment with varying concentrations
of shikonin and derivatives are summarized in
Figure 1B. Four compounds, i.e. isobutyrylshikonin,
2-methylbutyrylshikonin, isovalerylshikonin and β,
β-dimethylacrylshikonin, showed stronger effects than
shikonin itself. Therefore, these derivatives were further
analyzed together with shikonin for their molecular
mechanisms against leukemia cells. The IC50 values
for shikonin and these four derivatives after 24 h were
also measured by resazurin assay. The other derivatives
were less toxic than shikonin towards U937 cells.
Furthermore, it was interesting that shikonin and its
homochiral derivatives were more active than their
enantiomers, e.g., the IC50 values of isobutyrylshikonin
(0.05 μM), 2-methylbutyrylshikonin (0.06 μM) and
β-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin (1.08 μM) were much
less than those of their corresponding enantiomers,
isobutyrylalkannin (1.03 μM), 2-methylbutyrylalkannin
(1.50 μM) and β-hydroxyisovalerylalkannin (16.64 μM).

Gene expression profiling of shikonin and
derivatives revealed MYC as novel common
molecular key player
Gene expression analyses were performed to get
deeper insights into the cytotoxic activity of shikonins.
U937 cells were treated 24 h with IC50 values of
shikonin, isobutyrylshikonin, 2-methylbutyrylshikonin,
isovalerylshikonin, β,β-dimethylacrylshikonin or DMSO
solvent control, respectively. Then, total RNA was isolated
for transcriptome-wide microarray analysis.
The numbers of deregulated genes upon treatment
with shikonin compounds were visualized as Venn
diagram (Figure 3A). Remarkably, about 18% of the
genes were present in the datasets of all five compounds.
If four of five compounds were taken into account,
265 genes are commonly differentially expressed
between treated and untreated cells. Through web-based
gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, the identified

91 co-regulated genes were assigned to multiple GO
terms categorized with the biological process, cellular
component and molecular function (Supplement table 1).
A ranking list of deregulated genes is shown in Table 1.
Remarkably, MYC was the most commonly downregulated gene among all five compounds. Six commonly
deregulated genes including MYC were quantified by
real-time RT-PCR to technically validate the microarray
results. The correlation coefficients (R-values) between
mRNA expression values determined by microarray
hybridization and real-time RT-PCR were in the range of
0.80 to 0.93 for each compound (Pearson correlation test).
Importantly, this indicated a high degree of concordance
between the data obtained from the two different methods
(Table 2).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We subjected all data obtained by microarray
analyses and subjected them to Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA). The deregulated genes were correlated
with several molecular and cellular functions, including
cell death and survival, cellular growth and proliferation,
cellular development, cellular movement, gene expression,
cell cycle, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, etc.

and pathways affected by shikonin and derivatives in

Furthermore, an upstream regulator analysis was
performed with IPA to identify transcriptional regulators,
kinases, or enzymes that may be responsible for gene
expression changes in U937 cells after treatment. Table 3
shows the upstream regulators predicted by IPA to be

Inhibition of c-MYC expression and its DNAbinding activity by shikonin and derivatives

inhibitors. These results were in concordance with the
Western blot analysis, since 10058-F4 caused the weakest
inhibition, while shikonin and derivatives showed strong
inhibition, which was similar to 10074-G5. This clearly
suggests that shikonin and its derivatives possess MYC
inhibitory activities.

The microarray analysis indicated that MYC was
not only the most commonly down-regulated gene, but
also the common upstream regulator affected by shikonin
and its four derivatives. Moreover, cell cycle G1/S check
point regulation, which is mainly regulated by MYC
[6], was also the top canonical pathway affected by
all shikonins. Therefore, we supposed that MYC itself
may be a potential target of this type of compounds. To
analyze this hypothesis, we performed Western blotting to
prove whether shikonin and its derivatives affect c-MYC
expression. Two known c-MYC inhibitors, 10074-G5
and 10058-F4 were used as control drugs. As shown in
Figure 4A, 4B, shikonin and all four derivatives indeed
revealed a strong inhibition of c-MYC expression in U937
cells at 1 μM and 0.3 μM. This effect was greater than that
of 10058-F4 and comparable to that of 10074-G5, however
at much lower concentrations than the control compounds.
Next, we attempted to determine, whether the
inhibition of c-MYC expression in U937 cells by shikonin
and its derivatives was associated with decreased
transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity of
c-MYC. For this purpose, we used a specific ELISAbased DNA-binding assay. In Figure 4C, the DNA binding
activity of c-MYC in nuclear extracts of U937 cells was
suppressed to different extents by treatment of 0.3 μM
shikonin and derivatives or 50 μM of the two control

Involvement of AKT and ERK1/2, JNK MAPK
signaling in shikonin-induced c-MYC downregulation
It is known that c-MYC is regulated by multiple
signaling pathways, including MAPK and AKT signal
transduction cascades [18, 26–28]. Therefore, we further
employed Western blot analysis to evaluate, whether
the MAPK and AKT signal transduction pathways were
involved in shikonin-induced c-MYC down-regulation
(Figure 5A). The results showed that shikonin inhibited
phospho-ERK1/2 and activated phospho-SAPK/JNK
without influencing total ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK
expression. However, both phospho-AKT and total AKT
expression were reduced by shikonin. No appreciable
changes were detected in phospho-p38 or total p38.
Comparable results were also found for the other shikonin
derivatives.
Then, we examined which signaling pathway may
play a critical role in regulation of c-MYC. A specific AKT
activator (SC79) and a specific JNK inhibitor (SP600125)
were independently used in combination with shikonin

inhibition of c-MYC expression is a general mechanism

Jurkat cells were 0.29 ± 0.03 μM, 1.68 ± 0.23 μM, 0.24 ±
0.03 μM and 0.97 ± 0.14 μM, respectively. Then, the cells
were treated with 0.3 or 1 μM shikonin for 24 h depended
on their different sensitivities, followed by whole cell
lysate extraction for Western blot analyses. The effect
of shikonin on c-MYC expression as well as AKT and
MAPK signaling cascades were measured. As displayed
in Figure 6A, shikonin suppressed c-MYC expression
to a different extent in all tested cell lines. Meanwhile,
reduction of phospho-AKT and total AKT, activation
of phospho-SAPK/JNK were also found in all four cell

activated in Jurkat cells and was inhibited by shikonin.
There were still no significant changes in phospo-p38 and
total p38 in all cell lines. All these results were comparable
to those of U937 cells, suggesting that AKT, ERK1/2,
SAPK/JNK/MAPK signaling cascades involved c-MYC
inhibition play a general role in shikonin-caused leukemia
cell death.

These values were also comparable with those of the
control inhibitors, indicating the feasibility for shikonin
and its derivatives directly targeting the c-MYC complex
and inducing MYC-related gene expression changes.
Docking modes and the binding energies for shikonin
and its derivatives and the control inhibitors on the MYCMAX complex are summarized in Figure 7.

Molecular docking

DISCUSSION

To further investigate the possible interaction of
shikonin and derivatives with c-MYC, molecular in silico
docking studies were performed. There exist at least two
binding sites in the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) leucine
zipper domain of the MYC-MAX complex [16]. Our blind
docking results showed that shikonin preferentially bound
to the same site as the control drug 10058-F4, while the
other derivatives docked to the domain, where the other
control drug 10074-G5 bound. Both binding sites were
in close proximity to the DNA binding region of MYC
and MAX. Shikonin and derivatives formed hydrogen
bonds with residues at the DNA binding regions of MYC,
i.e. Arg925, Lys939. The lowest binding energies of
shikonin and its derivatives were similar and in a range
from −6.65 ± 0.11 kcal/mol to −6.85 ± 0.01 kcal/mol.

In the present investigation, we showed that
shikonin and 14 derivatives revealed strong cytotoxicity
towards U937 leukemia cells. Especially, the four
derivatives–isobutyrylshikonin, 2-methylbutyrylshikonin,
isovalerylshikonin and β,β-dimethylacrylshikonin–that
were more effective than the lead compound shikonin.
Moreover, it was intriguing to observe that shikonin
and its homochiral derivatives were more active than
their enantiomers. For example, the IC50 value for
shikonin was 25 folds lower than that of alkannin.
Similarly, isobutyrylshikonin, 2-methylbutyrylshikonin
and β-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin also showed lower
IC50 values than their corresponding enantiomers,
isobutyrylalkannin,
2-methylbutyrylalkannin
and
β-hydroxyisovalerylalkannin, indicating that differences

in the stereochemistry at C-11 may influence the activity.
This structure-activity relationship was consistent with
what we found in glioblastoma cell lines and other reports
[24, 29]. Another interesting point is that leukemia cell
lines were more sensitive than solid tumor cell lines [25].
A plethora of studies, including clinical research, reported
that leukemia is generally very sensitive to anticancer
reagents that either block the cell cycle process or cause
apoptosis [30–33]. Therefore, we proposed that the
particular activities of shikonin and its derivatives against
leukemia cells may be correlated with their strong effect
to induce cell cycle disruption and apoptosis. Previous
studies reported that shikonin caused an arrest of U937
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells in the G1 and S phase and decreased expression of
cell cycle-related proteins, such as cyclin D, CDK and
PCNA [25, 34]. However, the mechanism of this effect
remains unknown as of yet. By means of microarray-based
gene expression analysis, we noticed that the transcription
factor MYC, which plays a very critical role in cell cycle
control, was the commonly deregulated molecule by
shikonin and its derivatives. MYC can influence cell
cycle progression through several parallel mechanisms,
such as transcription of target genes including CDKs,
cyclins and E2F that encode many important positive cell
cycle regulators, hyperactivating cyclin/Cdk complexes
through the induction of CDK-activating kinase (CAK)

cell from death. This means that necroptosis, which
was induced mostly by high dose of shikonin or its
derivatives [42–44], perhaps could also be triggered by
low concentrations of shikonins as a secondary death
mechanism. Additional experiments such as electron
microscopy analysis will help to further confirm this
effect. The role of c-MYC in apoptosis is intricate,
depended on the specific cell type and the physiological
status of the cell. Both reduction and overexpression
of c-MYC can lead to apoptosis [45, 46]. However, in
hematopoietic cells, apoptosis is closely correlated with
reduction of c-MYC expression. For example, apoptosis
of CEM lymphoblastoid cells induced by oxysterol
25-hydroxycholesterol was preceded by ≥ 90% reduction
in c-MYC levels [47]. Treatment of K562 erythroleukemia
cells with the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or
calyculin A caused down-regulation of c-MYC and MAX
expression and led to apoptosis [48]. The myeloid HL-60
leukemia cell line also underwent apoptosis by treatments
that reduce c-MYC expression [49]. In addition, the small
molecule c-MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 inhibited proliferation
and induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway
of apoptosis in several acute myelocytic leukemia cell
lines [50]. Therefore, we believe that apoptosis induced by
shikonin and its derivatives in U937 cells is also associated
with inhibition of c-MYC expression.
In an attempt to explore, how shikonin and its
derivatives inhibit c-MYC expression and activity, we
examined the effect of shikonins on signaling pathways
that may regulate c-MYC expression. It has been showed
that shikonin or its derivatives inhibit cancer cells via AKT/
mTOR and MAPK signaling cascades [51–55]. Our results
are consistent with these previous findings, as shikonin and
derivatives demonstrated significant effects on ERK1/2,
SAPK/JNK MAPK kinases pathways and AKT pathways.
These pathways play an important role in the control of
c-MYC protein stability, accumulation and subsequent
transcriptional activity. c-MYC protein stability is strongly
influenced by phosphorylation of two adjacent N-terminal
sites, threonine 58 (Thr58) and serine 62 (Ser62), which
display opposing roles. Phosphorylation of Ser62 that is
mediated by ERK pathway kinase activity stabilizes c-MYC,
while phosphorylation of Thr58 by GSK-3 promotes c-MYC
degradation [56]. GSK-3 activity is usually inhibited
through PI3K/AKT. Only if AKT activity declines, GSK3 has the capacity to phosphorylate Thr58 and to induce
the degradation of c-MYC [57]. Meanwhile, JNK also
contributes to c-MYC stability by increasing its ubiquitindependent degradation via a δ-like domain [58]. In addition
to the influence on c-MYC protein stability, the PI3K/
AKT and MAPK pathways also take part in the regulation
of c-MYC-mediated transcription by phosphorylating
and promoting MAD1 degradation. MAD1 suppresses
c-MYC transcriptional activity by competing with c-MYC
for heterodimerization with its partner MAX [26]. Thus,
inhibition of the ERK/PI3K/AKT pathway, or activation

and CDC25 phosphatases as well as impairment of cell
cycle inhibitors such as p21 and p27 [35]. Inhibition
of MYC expression, down-regulation or inactivation
of MYC in cycling cells results in cell cycle arrest and
impairs cell cycle progression in various cell lines,
including human lymphoid and myeloid cells [35–37].
GO enrichment analysis by DAVID showed that MYC was
indeed widely involved in the main biological processes
such as cell cycle and cell death. Additionally, cellular
pathways analysis by IPA also provided supporting
information that G1/S checkpoint regulation was the
most disturbed pathway upon treatment with shikonin
and its derivatives. This further indicated that cell cycle
arrest in U937 cells resulted from deregulation of MYC
and shikonin and its derivatives may be potential MYC
inhibitors. To prove this hypothesis, we examined the
effect on c-MYC expression and its transcriptional
activity by Western blotting and a specific ELISAbased DNA-binding assay. Shikonin and its derivatives
exerted remarkable inhibition on c-MYC expression and
its DNA-binding activity, which was much better than
the known MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 and comparable to
10074-G5. Moreover, the effective concentrations for
c-MYC inhibition were much lower than those of both
control drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report for shikonin to kill cancer cells by targeting
c-MYC, suggesting a novel role of shikonins as antitumor
agents. In addition to MYC, another two cancer-related
molecules MYB and MS4A3 were also significantly
down-regulated by all five shikonin derivatives. MYB is
a proto-oncogene which is overexpressed in most human
myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemias [38]. It actively
contributes to leukemogenesis by promoting proliferation,
suppressing apoptosis and blocking differentiation [39].
MS4A3 (also known as HTm4) encodes a member of
membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily, which acts
as an important cell cycle regulator in various cancers,
especially in hematological malignancies [40, 41].
Therefore, it was likely that the dysregulation of MYB
and MS4A3 also contribute to shikonin and its derivatives
induced cell cycle arrest and cell death in U937 cells. It
is worth performing further experiments to clarify the
potential effect of shikonin on them.
On the other hand, we clarified the death mode of
U937 cells by annexin V-PI double staining in the presence
or absence of the specific necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 and
the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. IC50 concentrations of
shikonin and derivatives mainly induced cell death by
caspase-dependent apoptosis, as evidenced by a remarkable
decrease in annexin V+/PI- and annexin V+/PI+ cells in
presence of z-VAD-fmk. This was in agreement with
previous reports that low concentrations of shikonin
induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in mitochondriae
in leukemia cells [42]. However, in addition to apoptosis,
we found that necroptosis seemed to be also induced by
shikonin and derivatives, as Nec-1 could partly rescued

of JNK signaling may lead to down-regulation of c-MYC.
Our results showed that reduction of c-MYC expression by
shikonins and its derivatives was closely correlated with
inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT and
activation of phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. This further
confirms the role of these pathways for c-MYC regulation.
However, neither the inhibition of AKT nor the activation
of SAPK/JNK alone appreciably reversed shikonin-induced
c-MYC suppression. This indicates a comprehensive effect
of ERK1/2, JNK MAPK and AKT signaling for downregulation of c-MYC and a direct interaction of shikonin
with c-MYC.
Our molecular docking studies demonstrated the
binding of shikonin and its derivatives to the DNA-binding
domain of c-MYC in a similar manner as the known
c-MYC inhibitors 10074-G5 and 10058-F4. Additionally,
c-MYC deregulation may in turn also act on AKT activity.
Recent studies reported that reduced c-MYC levels led
to decreased AKT activity in vitro and in vivo [59, 60].
Thus, AKT down-regulation upon shikonin treatment
may be further reinforced as negative feedback of c-MYC
down-regulation. Co-targeting of AKT and c-MYC has
been recently shown to be a synergistic treatment strategy
for leukemia therapy [61, 62], since shikonin and its
derivatives strongly deregulate the AKT signaling pathway
and directly inhibit c-MYC activity. Therefore, they
represent promising candidates for leukemia treatment.
Moreover, the mechanism of shikonin in U937 cells
also applies for other leukemia cell lines, including the
multidrug-resistant cell line CEM/ADR5000. This indicates
that inhibition of c-MYC with involvement of the ERK/
JNK/MAPK and AKT pathways represents a general
mechanism for shikonin and its derivatives in killing
leukemia cells. Notably, multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000
cells were even more sensitive to shikonin than the wild-type
cell line CCRF-CEM, as evidenced by the lower IC50 value.
The phenomenon of hypersensitivity of multidrug-resistant
cells has been termed collateral sensitivity [63]. Considering
the important role of c-MYC in drug-resistant leukemia,
we assume that shikonin’s collateral sensitivity in CEM/
ADR5000 cells may be also c-MYC-related. This opens
avenues for shikonin and its derivatives for combination
therapies to treat otherwise drug-resistant tumors.
In a word, the novel mechanisms for shikonin and
its derivatives reported in the present study make these
compounds attractive candidates for the treatment of
hematological malignancies.

Sciences (Lörrach, Germany).

Cell cultures
The parental human monocytic AML cell line
U937, ALL cell lines Molt4 and Jurkat were obtained
from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ,
Heidelberg, Germany). The original source of the cell
lines is the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
USA). ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM and its derived CEM/
ADR5000 cell lines were generously provided by Prof.
Axel Sauerbrey (Department of Pediatrics, University of
Jena, Jena, Germany). Cells were cultivated in complete
RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% of a stock solution of 10,000 U/mL penicillin
G and 10 mg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified air
incubator (95%) containing 5% CO2. CEM/ADR5000 cells
were continuously treated with 5000 ng/mL doxorubicin
to maintain the multidrug-resistance phenotype. All
experiments were performed with cells in the logarithmic
growth phase.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was evaluated by the resazurin assay.
This test is based on the reduction of the indicator dye,
resazurin, to the highly fluorescent resorufin by viable
cells. Nonviable cells rapidly lose the metabolic capacity
to reduce resazurin and, thus, do not produce a fluorescent
signal. In brief, 2 × 104 cells were sowed in a 96-well
culture plate in a total volume of 100 μL for each well.
Marginal wells were filled with 200 μL of pure medium,
in order to minimize the effects of evaporation. Besides,
wells filled with medium served as negative control to
determine background fluorescence that may be present.
Then, cells were immediately treated with different
concentrations of shikonin and its derivatives. After 24 h
or 72 h, 20 μL resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.01% w/v
in ddH2O) was added to each well and the plates were
incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Fluorescence was measured
in an Infinite M2000 Proplate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim,
Germany) using an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and
an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Each assay was done
at least three times, with six replicates each. The cytotoxic
effect of the treatment was determined as percentage of
viability and compared to untreated cells. The toxicity of
compounds was determined by means of the formula:

The calculated cell viability (y-axis) was plotted
against the log drug concentration (x-axis) using Microsoft
Excel. The obtained curve was used to determine the IC50
value, which represented the concentration of the test
compound required to inhibit 50% of cell proliferation.

The cell death mode induced by shikonin and
its derivatives was analyzed by annexin V-PI double
staining. Annexin V is an intracellular protein that
calcium-dependently binds to phosphatidylserine (PS),
which translocates from the intracellular leaflet of the
plasma membrane to the external leaflet during early
apoptosis. Propidium iodide (PI) is excluded by living
or early apoptotic cells with intact membranes and stains
late apoptotic and necrotic cells with red fluorescence
due to DNA intercalation. Therefore, cells with annexin
V (-) and PI (-) are considered to be alive, while cells
with annexin V (+) and PI (-) are in early apoptosis. Cells
in late apoptosis or necrosis are both annexin V and PI
positive. Briefly, 5 × 105 U937 cells were treated 50 μM
necrostatin-1 (Nec-1; Enzo Life Sciences) or 50 μM
z-VAD-fmk (Selleckchem, Munich, Germany) 1 h prior
to co-incubation with IC50 concentrations of shikonin or
its derivatives for 24 h. Following incubation, cells were
collected and incubated with annexin V and PI staining
solution (BioVision, Heidelberg, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, cells
were measured with FACS Calibur analyzer (BectonDickinson Biosciences). For each sample, 2 × 104 cells
were counted. The annexin V-FITC signal was measured
with 488 nm excitation and detected using a 530/30 nm
band pass filter. The PI signal was analyzed with 561
nm excitation and detected using a 610/20 nm band pass
filter. All parameters were plotted on a logarithmic scale.
Cytographs were analyzed using FlowJo software (Celeza,
Olten, Switzerland).

Amplification kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, USA). Biotinlabeled cRNA samples for hybridization on Illumina
Human HT-12 BeadChip arrays were prepared according
to Illumina’s recommended sample labeling procedure
based on the modified Eberwine protocol [64]. The cRNA
was column purified according to TotalPrep™ RNA
Amplification Kit (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany)
and eluted in 60–80 μL water. Hybridization was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Microarray
scanning was done using an Illumina® BeadStation array
scanner (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), setting adjusted
to a scaling factor of 1 and PMT settings at 430. Data was
extracted for each individually, and outliers were removed,
if the median absolute deviation (MAD) exceeded 2.5.
Then, mean average signals and standard deviations
were calculated for each probe. Data analysis was done
by using the quantile normalization algorithm without
background subtraction, and differentially regulated
genes were defined by calculating the standard deviation
differences of a given probe in a one-by-one comparison of
samples or groups. The data obtained was further filtered
with Chipster software including the steps that filtering of
genes by two times standard deviation and a subsequent
assessment of significance using empirical Bayes t-test (p
< 0.05) with Bonferroni correction. Filtered genes were fed
into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA; Ingenuity
Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA) and analyzed by the
core analysis tool to determine cellular networks and
functions affected by each drug treatment. The results of
the core analyses were further studied using the comparison
analysis tool, offering the possibility to compare datasets
of samples treated by different compounds. Gene ontology

All samples were run in duplicates and the experiment was
repeated once.

The X-ray crystallography based structure of MYC/
MAX complex (PDB code: 1NKP) was obtained from
RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/
home/home.do) and used as docking template throughout
the docking calculations. The bHLH and leucine zipper
regions of the proteins were covered in the PDB file. The
2D structures of shikonin and its derivatives were energyminimized and converted to 3D structures compatible
for docking operation using the open source program
Corina (Molecular Networks, Erlangen, Germany). Two
known MYC inhibitors, 10074-G5 and 10058-F4, were
used as control drugs to compare their binding modes
and affinities with shikonin and its derivatives [17, 67].
Molecular docking was then carried out with Autodock
program (AutoDock 4.2, The Scripps Research Institute,
La Jolla, CA, USA) following a protocol previously
reported by us [68]. Docking parameters were set to
250 runs and 25,000,000 energy evaluations for each

Cells were washed twice with PBS after treatment
with the indicated concentrations of shikonin, its
derivatives, 10074-G5 or 10058-F4 for 24 h and lysed
in lysis buffer (M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction
Reagent, Thermo Scientific, plus protease inhibitor,
Roche, Mannheim, Germany) containing phosphatase
inhibitor (Roche). After shaking 30 min at 4°C, the
lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min and the
supernatant was quantified by Nanodrop. Equal amounts
of protein extracts (30 μg) were separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The membrane
was first rinsed with TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then blocked with
5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBST for 1 h at room
temperature. The blocked membrane was subsequently
incubated overnight at 4°C with specific primary
antibodies (Cell Signaling, Technology/New England
Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). After washed three times
with TBST for 10 min, the membrane was incubated for
1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (Cell Signaling). After the membrane had been
washed with TBST, the immunoreactivity was revealed
by use of a Luminata Classico Western HRP Substrate
(Millipore), and the densities of the protein bands were
quantified by FluorChem Q software (Biozym Scientific

DNA binding activity of c-MYC
transcription factors

Qiaoli Zhao performed the experiments and wrote
the paper. Sabine M. Klauck performed the microarray
hybridizations. Andreana N. Assimopoulou, Ioanna
Chinou, José-Luis Rios, Nadine Kretschmer, Rudolf Bauer
and Vassilios P. Papageorgiou isolated and provided the
14 derivatives. Thomas Efferth supervised the project and
wrote the paper.

The c-MYC DNA binding activity assays were
performed using TransAM enzyme-linked Immunosorbent
assay (ELISA)-based kits (Active Motif, Rixensart,
Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extracts from control, shikonin,
derivatives, 10074-G5 or 10058-F4-treated cells were
separately incubated in a 96-well plate immobilized with
an oligonucleotide containing the c-MYC consensus
binding site (5′-CACGTG-3′). The active forms of
transcription factors from extracts, which specifically
bound to this oligonucleotide, were detected by a primary
antibody against c-MYC in an ELISA-like format. The
absorbance of the sensitive colorimetric reaction mediated
by a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody was measured
on the Infinite M2000 Proplate reader (Tecan) at 450 nm
with a reference wavelength of 655 nm.
