Abstract
Idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) is likely the consequence of both
the acquisition of genetic mutations and epigenetic changes
that silence critical genes that control cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis. We have explored the effects of
the sequential treatment with the DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor, decitabine [5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5azaD)], followed by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A
(TSA), on the behavior of IM CD34+ cells. Unlike normal CD34+
cells where 5azaD/TSA treatment leads to the expansion of
CD34+ cells and marrow-repopulating cells, treatment of IM
CD34+ cells results in a reduction of the number of total
cells, CD34+ cells, and assayable hematopoietic progenitor
cells (HPC). In IM, HPCs are either heterozygous or homozygous for the JAK2V617F mutation or possess wild-type JAK2
in varying proportions. Exposure of IM CD34+ cells to 5azaD/
TSA resulted in a reduction of the proportion of JAK2V617Fpositive HPCs in 83% of the patients studied and the reduction
in the proportion of homozygous HPCs in 50% of the patients.
5azaD/TSA treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the
number of HPCs that contained chromosomal abnormalities
in two JAK2V617F-negative IM patients. IM is characterized by
constitutive mobilization of HPCs, which has been partly
attributed to decreased expression of the chemokine receptor
CXCR4. Treatment of IM CD34+ cells with 5azaD/TSA resulted
in the up-regulation of CXCR4 expression by CD34+ cells and
restoration of their migration in response to SDF-1. These
data provide a rationale for sequential therapy with chromatin-modifying agents for patients with IM. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Idiopathic myelofibrosis (IM) is a chronic myeloproliferative
disorder (MPD) characterized by cytopenias, a leukoerythroblastic
blood picture, splenomegaly, teardrop RBC, marrow fibrosis,
constitutive mobilization of CD34+ cells, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and increased bone marrow (BM) microvessel density (1).
In approximately half of patients with IM, hematopoietic cells
possess either the JAK2V617F or MPLW515L/K somatic mutations
which are activating mutations that confer increased sensitivity to

hematopoietic cytokines (2–7). JAK2V617F is a subtle mutation
that induces a limited gain of function in JAK2. There is evidence
that its activation requires the presence of cytokine receptors to
induce signaling (8). The number of V617F JAK2 copies likely
contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity of the JAK2V617F
myeloproliferative disorders. About one-third of patients with
polycythemia vera (PV) have a biallele (homozygous) JAK2V617F
mutation accompanied by a 9p loss of heterozygosity, whereas the
remainders have a single mutational allele (monoallele). The
frequency of a biallelic homozygous JAK2V617F is significantly
higher in patients with myelofibrosis developed with a preceding
history of PV than in essential thrombocythemia-related myelofibrosis or patients with primary IM (9).
IM is characterized by the constitutive mobilization of primitive
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) and hematopoietic stem
cells (HSC; refs. 10–13). Barosi et al. (10) recently showed that the
peripheral blood (PB) of IM patients contained 360 times more
CD34+ cells than normal individuals and 18 to 30 times more
CD34+ cells than patients with other Philadelphia chromosomenegative (Ph) MPDs. In addition, the PB CD34+ cell number was
further shown to be related to disease progression and to serve as
a biomarker for disease activity in patients with IM (10). The
number of assayable HPCs presented in the PB of IM patients has
also been shown to be increased (10–13). Furthermore, we have
reported that PB CD34+ cells in IM contain not only HPCs but
also BM-repopulating cells belonging to the malignant clone (13).
Our laboratory has shown that IM is characterized by a
proteolytic environment that contributes to the sustained
mobilization of CD34+ cells (13, 14). The increased trafficking of
CD34+ cells in IM, therefore, seems to be a distinctive biological
characteristic of IM.
In normal individuals, only a small fraction of HSCs/HPCs
regularly exit the BM and circulate in the PB (15). Maintenance
of the balance between mobilization, homing, and retention of
HSCs/HPCs within the marrow microenvironment is an important characteristic of normal adult BM homeostasis. Stem cell
trafficking is largely dependent on the interaction between a
number of integrins and chemokine receptors expressed by stem
cells and progenitors with a variety of matrix proteins and
chemokines elaborated by marrow fibroblasts, osteoblasts, or
endothelial cells (16). The CXC chemokine stromal-derived
factor-1 (SDF-1) plays a major role in migration, proliferation,
differentiation, and survival of many cell types, including human
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. CXC-chemokine receptor-4
(CXCR4), the 7-transmenbrane receptor of SDF-1 is widely
expressed by a variety of hematopoietic cell lineages (16). SDF1/CXCR4 interactions are thought to play an important role in
stem cell migration and differentiation (16, 17). We have
previously reported that CXCR4 expression was down-regulated
in the CD34+ cells of patients with IM; this abnormality was

thought to contribute to the constitutive mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that occurs in patients with
IM (14, 18).
The malignant phenotype in IM likely results from a combination of genetic abnormalities and epigenetic modifications leading
to the dysregulation of critical genes that contribute to cell
proliferation, differentiation, and cell death (2–7, 19–21). Methylation of cytosine residues in the promoter region as well
transcriptional inhibitory complexes including histone deacetylases
(HDAC) play a role in the transcriptional silencing of genes in a
variety of human cancers (22–24). A considerable amount of data
has been reported which indicates that re-expression of most
silenced genes through promoter demethylation requires sequential application of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors
followed by HDAC inhibitors (22–30).
In this report, we have explored the sequential use of 5-aza-2¶deoxycytidine (5azaD) and trichostatin A (TSA) for the treatment
of IM. We determined that treatment of IM CD34+ cells with
chromatin-modifying agents resulted in the up-regulation of
functional CXCR4 expression by CD34+ cells and to the reduction
of the number of JAK2V617F-positive progenitor cells. It is
anticipated that such data might serve as a potential platform
with which to proceed with clinical trials of these agents in
patients with IM.

Materials and Methods
Patients. PB was collected from 16 patients with IM after informed
consent was obtained according to the guidelines of the Institutional
Review Board at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. All patients
met the WHO diagnostic criteria for IM (31). None of the patients were
receiving cytotoxic agents at the time of study.
Purification of IM PB CD34+ cells. The PB was layered onto FicollHypaque (1.077 g/mL; Amersham Biosciences) and low-density mononuclear cells separated after centrifugation. Granulocytes were isolated by
standard techniques as previously described (4–6). A CD34+ cell population
was isolated using a human CD34+ cell selection kit (StemCell Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity of the CD34+ cell
population was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson). Cell fractions having a CD34+ cell purity of 90% or greater were
used for all experiments.
Ex vivo cultures exposed to 5azaD and TSA. An ex vivo culture system
for IM CD34+ cells was established as previously described (32–34). Briefly,
IM PB CD34+ cells (1  105 per well) were cultured in 2.5 mL Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Bio Whittaker) containing 30% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; HyClone Laboratories) supplemented with 100 ng/mL
stem cell factor (SCF), 100 ng/mL FLT-3 ligand (FL), 100 ng/mL
thrombopoietin, and 50 ng/mL interleukin-3 (IL-3; Amgen) and incubated
in a humidified incubator maintained at 37jC with 5% CO2. After an initial
16 h of incubation, cells were exposed to 5azaD (Pharmachemie B.V.) at a
concentration of 106 mol/L. After 48 h, cells were washed and then
distributed to new culture plates containing SCF, FL, and thrombopoietin
with TSA (Sigma), which was added once at the beginning of the following
7-day culture done at a concentration 16.5 nmol/L. In addition, identical
cultures to which 5azaD/TSA were not added were done in parallel. In some
experiments, the CD34+ cells were reisolated after 9 days of culture and
assayed for their ability to migrate in response to SDF-1 or to form
hematopoietic colonies.
Flow-cytometric analysis. After 9 days of culture, cells were stained
with antihuman CD34 monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to FITC in
combination with antihuman CXCR4 (CD184) or CD90 conjugated to
phycoerythrin. All mAb were purchased from Becton Dickinson PharMingen. Cells were incubated with specific mAb or isotype-identical control
immunoglobulin G for 30 min on ice in the dark. Immediately before

fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, 1 Ag/mL propidium iodide
(Sigma) was added for the exclusion of nonviable cells. Data were acquired
on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and at least 10,000
live cells were acquired for each analysis (Cell-Quest software; Becton
Dickinson). Both the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CXCR4
expression on CD34+ cells and the percentage of CXCR4+CD34+ cells within
the CD34+ cell population were assessed.
Hematopoietic progenitor cell assays. Primary IM CD34+ cells or IM
CD34+ cells reisolated following culture with cytokines alone or cytokines
plus chromatin-modifying agents were assayed in semisolid media as
described previously (14, 33). Briefly, 5  102 cells were plated per dish in
duplicate cultures containing 1 mL IMDM with 1.1% methylcellulose, 30%
FBS, 5  105 mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Stem Cell Technologies), to which
100 ng/mL SCF, 100 ng/mL thrombopoietin, 100 ng/mL IL-3, 100 ng/mL
IL-6, 100 ng/mL granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), and 5 units/mL erythropoietin were added. Colonies were enumerated after 14 days of incubation, and individual colonies were plucked and
genotyped for the JAK2V617F mutation. The percentage of JAK2V617Fpositive colonies formed by CD34+ cells before and following 9 days of
culture was determined. In two cases of JAK2V617F-negative IM, cytospin
preparations (Shandon) of plucked colonies were prepared, and the
percentage of cells belonging to the malignant clone was determined by
interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for a marker
chromosomal abnormality.
Migration assay. The migration behavior of primary IM CD34+ cells
before and following cell culture was done as previously described using
6.5-mm-diameter, 5-Am-pore transwell plates (Corning; refs. 14, 35). Briefly,
transwell filters were coated overnight at 4jC with 10 mg/cm2 of fibronectin
(Sigma) at a concentration of 20 Ag/mL in PBS. The coating solution was
aspirated and replaced by a 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution in PBS
at 37jC for 30 min to block nonspecific binding sites. Before cells were
added to the upper compartment, the coated transwell filters were washed
twice with transwell buffer (IMDM with 0.5% BSA). Then, 100,000 to 200,000
CD34+ cells in 100 AL transwell buffer were placed in the upper chamber of
the transwell. About 600 AL transwell buffers containing 200 ng/mL SDF-1
were added to the lower compartment. After incubation at 37jC for 4 h,
nonmigrating and migrating cells were harvested from the upper and lower
compartments, respectively. Nonmigrating cells were recovered following
two washes each consisting of a 5-min treatment with an enzyme-free cell
dissociation buffer (Life Technologies) at 37jC, followed by vigorous
pipetting. The harvested cells in the two fractions were enumerated using a
hemacytometer. The percentage of cells migrating was calculated by
determining the ratio of the number of cells recovered from the lower
compartment to the total number of cells loaded in the upper
compartment.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay of CXCR4
mRNA and the percent of JAK2 V617F/JAK2 total. Total RNA was extracted
from primary IM CD34+ and CD34+ cells (50,000–100,000) reisolated after
culture by using a PicroPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus Bioscience).
First-strand complimentary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from total RNA
with SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of the primers used for the
amplification were as follows: CXCR4 (161 bp), 5¶-AGGGGATCAGTTATACACTT-3¶ ( forward), 5¶-TGCCCACAATGCCAGTTAAG-3¶ (reverse); h-actin
(176 bp), 5¶-AGCCTCGCCTTTGCCGA-3¶ ( forward), 5¶-CTGGTGCCTGGGGCG-3¶ (reverse). The quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) assays were done with the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems), and the PCR products were detected by the use
of SYBR green technology (ABI). Cycling conditions included initial
denaturation at 95jC for 10 min, then by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95jC
for 15 s, annealing at 55jC for 30 s, and extension at 72jC for 30 s. All assays
were done in triplicate, and a negative control was included in each assay.
To quantify CXCR4 mRNA expression in relation to an internal control, an
amplification standard curve of the reference gene h-actin was established as
previously described (34, 36). The CXCR4 mRNA expression was quantified by
measuring threshold cycle and presented as relative rates compared with the
expression of the reference gene h-actin.

Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from granulocytes using the EasyDNA Kit (Invitrogen) and was used for the determination of the percent of
JAK2 V617F/JAK2 total by real-time quantitative kinetic PCR assay using the
allelic discrimination method as previously used in our laboratory (37).
Nested allele-specific PCR for JAK2V617F-positive colonies. Individual hematopoietic colonies were randomly plucked from the semisolid
media, and gDNA was isolated by using the Extract-N-Amp Blood PCR Kits
(Sigma). The JAK2V617F mutation was detected by using nested allelespecific PCR as previously described (38). Briefly, a 521-bp DNA fragment
containing the V617F mutation site was amplified from the gDNA using
primers P1 5¶-GATCTCCATATTCCAGGCTTACACA-3¶ and P1r 5¶-TATTGTTTGGGCATTGTAACCTTCT-3¶. After 35 cycles consisting of 30 s at 95jC,
30 s at 60jC, and 30 s at 72jC, 0.5-AL PCR products were further amplified
by nested and allele-specific primers P2 5¶-CCTCAGAACGTTGATGGCA-3¶,
P2r 5¶-ATTGCTTTCCTTTTTCACAAGA-3¶, Pnf 5¶-AGCATTTGGTTTTAAATTATGGAGTATATG-3¶, and Pmr 5¶-GTTTTACTTACTCTCGTCTCCACAAAA3¶, following 35 cycles of 95jC for 30 s, 59jC for 25 s, and 72jC for 25 s. The
final PCR products were analyzed on 2.5% agarose gels. The nested PCR
product had a size of 453 bp. A 279-bp product indicated allele-specific
JAK2V617F positive whereas a 229-bp product denoted allele-specific wild
product. Colonies classified as homozygous for JAK2V617F contained only
the 279-bp band, whereas heterozygous colonies were identified based on
the presence of both the 279-bp and 229-bp bands.
Detection of isochromosome 17 and monosomy 7 by interphase
FISH. CD34+ cells from two patients with known cytogenetic abnormalities,
isochromosome 17q and monosomy 7, respectively, were studied in an
identical fashion. Cytospin preparations of pooled plucked hematopoietic
colonies assayed following exposure to cytokines or cytokines plus
chromatin-modifying agents were made. Interphase FISH was done using
probes for isochromosome 17 (RARA in 17q11.2) and monosomy 7 (D7Z1 at
the centromere of chromosome 7) according to the manufacturer’s (Abbott
Molecular) instructions (13). Three signals, rather then the normal two,
from the RARA gene probe were indicative of an isochromosome 17q and
one signal for D7Z1, instead of the normal two, indicated monosomy of
chromosome 7. In each experiment, 100 cells were scored.
Statistical analysis. Results are reported as mean F SD of data obtained
from varying numbers of individual experiments. Statistical significance was
determined using Student’s t tests or paired-samples t test. All P values are
two-sided.

CD34+ cells phenotype after 5azaD/TSA treatment. IM CD34+
cells (1  105) generated greater numbers of cells in the presence of
cytokines alone (16.7 F 14.3  105) than in the presence of
cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA (6.7 F 4.6  105; P < 0.05). IM CD34+
cells were phenotypically characterized before and following 9 days
of exposure to cytokines alone or cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA.
The proportion of CD34+ cells in cultures containing 5azaD/TSA
(11.3 F 8.9%) was greater than in cultures containing cytokines
alone (6.3 F 7.3%). Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. 1A, 68.7 F
17.6% of the CD34+ cells after 9 days of culture in the presence of
5azaD/TSA coexpressed CD34+ and CD90+, whereas only 36.3 F
18.1% of the cells in the cultures exposed to cytokines alone were
CD34+CD90+ (P < 0.001). The absolute number of IM CD34+ cells
and CD34+CD90+ cells in both cultures exposed to cytokines alone
or cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA represented almost half of the
number present in the input population (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 2A, the percentage of cells within the 5azaD/
TSA-treated IM CD34+ cells fraction which expressed CXCR4 was
significantly greater (47.8 F 15.4%; P = 0.006) than that of the cells
exposed to cytokines alone (30.3 F 13.9%) or primary IM CD34+
cells (12.8 F 6.4%). In addition, the absolute number of CD34+ cells
expressing CXCR4 was 2- to 10-fold greater following treatment
with 5azaD/TSA as compared with the input number of

www.aacrjournals.org

CD34+CXCR4+ cells (data not shown). These data show that the
proportion of CD34+ cells that are CXCR4+ increases after 9 days of
culture in the presence of cytokines alone, and that this proportion
is further enhanced in cells exposed to cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA.
To determine whether the level of CXCR4 receptor expression
increased on 5azaD/TSA-treated CD34+ cells, we analyzed the
CXCR4 MFI on the CD34+ cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, CXCR4 MFI of
the 5azaD/TSA-treated CD34+ cells was 47.0 F 29.5, which was
significantly greater (P = 0.021) than that of CD34+ cells exposed to
cytokines alone (24.6 F 13.8) or primary IM CD34+ cells (11.5 F
3.8). These results strongly indicate that 5azaD/TSA treatment
leads to the up-regulation of CXCR4 receptor expression by IM PB
CD34+ cells.
Effect of 5azaD/TSA treatment on CXCR4 mRNA expression.
We have previously reported that CXCR4 mRNA expression was
reduced in IM PB CD34+ cells and granulocytes as compared with
their normal counterparts (14, 18). We tested if CXCR4 transcripts
were up-regulated following exposure of IM PB CD34+ cells to
5azaD/TSA. CXCR4 mRNA expression level in CD34+ cells was
normalized to h-actin and was assessed by quantitative real-time
RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C, relatively higher level of CXCR4
transcripts (2.95 F 1.65) were observed in CD34+ cells treated with
5azaD/TSA as compared with the cells in cultures exposed to
cytokines alone (1.07 F 0.63, P = 0.005).
Migration capacity of IM CD34+ cells exposed to chromatinmodifying agents. To assess the functional consequences of the
up-regulation of CXCR4 expression by IM CD34+ cells, we examined
the migration of 5azaD/TSA-treated CD34+ cells in response to
SDF-1 in vitro in comparison with CD34+ cells reisolated from
cultures supplemented with cytokines alone as well as primary
CD34+ cells. IM PB CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines alone or
cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA were reisolated after 9 days of culture.
CD34+ cells were placed in the top chamber of a transwell, and
their migration in response to SDF-1 in the bottom chamber was
monitored. We determined that 5azaD/TSA-treated CD34+ cells
had a greater migration capacity (25.7 F 7.2%, P = 0.009) toward
SDF-1 (Fig. 2D), as compared with CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines
only (13.7 F 5.7%) or primary IM CD34+ cells (5.3 F 1.7%).
The effects of 5azaD/TSA on the number of assayable HPCs.
We have previously reported that 5azaD/TSA treatment resulted in
the expansion of the numbers of normal marrow and cord blood
progenitor cells (32–34). By contrast, similar 5azaD/TSA treatment
of IM CD34+ cells resulted in a marked reduction of all classes of
progenitor cells assayable as compared with primary IM CD34+
cells and IM CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines alone (Fig. 3).
5azaD/TSA treatment reduces the burden of JAK2V617Fpositive colonies. The JAK2V617F allele status of granulocytes
isolated from the 16 patients with IM was determined. A total of 10
of the 16 patients were JAK2V617F positive, and in 6 of 10 patients,
the effects of treatment with 5azaD/TSA on the numbers of
JAK2V617F-positive colonies were assessed. As can be seen in
Table 1, three of the six patients were heterozygous, and three were
homozygous for the mutant allele.
To assess the effect of 5azaD/TSA treatment on the burden of
malignant progenitor cells, CD34+ cells from these IM patients who
harbored the JAK2V617F mutation were studied. CD34+ cells were
cultured for 9 days with cytokines alone or cytokines plus 5azaD/
TSA, and the CD34+ cells were reisolated. Primary and reisolated
CD34+ cells were plated in semisolid media, and half of the total
colonies were randomly plucked after 14 days of culture and
analyzed for JAK2V617F mutation using nested allele-specific PCR.

Figure 1. A and B, phenotypic analysis of CD34+ cells following exposure to chromatin-modifying agents. A, the percentage of CD34+ cells within the total cultured
cells and the percentage of CD90+ cells within the primary CD34+ cells (n = 4) and the CD34+ cell population in the cultured cells following 9 d of culture in
the presence of cytokines alone or cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA. Columns, mean; bars, SD. There was a significant difference in the percentage of CD34+CD90+
cells within the CD34+ cell population obtained following 5azaD/TSA treatment as compared with the cultures containing cytokines alone (n = 13; P < 0.001).
B, representative flow-cytometric analysis of the coexpression of CD34 and CD90 within primary CD34+ cells, and cells of 9 d of culture with or without 5azaD/TSA.
A high proportion of CD34+CD90+ cells are shown in the R3 region.

As can be seen in Table 1, 34% to 100% of the hematopoietic
colonies cloned from primary IM CD34+ cells were JAK2V617F
positive, and 40% to 100% of these colonies were homozygous for
the mutation, whereas the remainder of the JAK2V617F-positive
colonies was heterozygous or wild type. In patients IM3, IM10,
IM31, and IM35, the presence of colonies that contained wild-type
JAK2 indicates that there is a population of normal progenitors
that persists in some IM patients. All of the colonies derived from
primary IM CD34+ cells of IM12 and IM17 were JAK2V617F
positive, and all of the colonies assayed from IM 12 CD34+ cells
were homozygous for the mutation, whereas in IM17, 62% of the
colonies were homozygous, and 38% were heterozygous for
JAK2V617F. These data indicate that in JAK2V617F-positive IM,
wild-type, monoallelic, and biallelic progenitors are present in
varying proportions. Exposure of IM CD34+ cells to cytokines
alone for 9 days did not result in a reduction of the numbers of
JAK2V617F-positive colonies or the numbers of colonies that
were homozygous. By contrast, treatment of IM CD34+ cells with
cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA resulted in a significant reduction of
proportion of colonies that were JAK2V617F positive (Fig. 4), as
compared with CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines alone (53 F 34%
versus 80 F 15%, P = 0.035, paired-samples t test). We also
observed a reduction in the proportion of JAK2V617F homozygous
colonies following the exposure to 5azaD/TSA as compared with
cytokines alone in three of six patients studied.
5azaD/TSA treatment also reduces the proportion of
progenitor cells that harbor cytogenetic abnormalities. We

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

studied two patients with JAK2V617F-negative IM that were
characterized by chromosomal abnormalities. The percentage of
malignant cells within the pooled colonies following treatment
with cytokine alone or cytokine plus 5azaD/TSA was monitored by
FISH analysis (Table 2). In both instances, 5azaD/TSA resulted in
a dramatic reduction of the numbers of colonies that contained
cells with the chromosome abnormality. None of the JAK2V617Fpositive patients studied had marker chromosome abnormalities.

Discussion
The initiation and progression of human malignancies are
thought to be due not only to the acquisition of genetic mutations
but also to epigenetic changes that are not caused by alterations in
the primary nucleotide sequence of DNA (22–30). These two
processes are closely interrelated in promoting the development of
cancer. Recently, several somatic mutations in either a tyrosine
kinase (JAK2) or a cytokine receptor (mpl) have been reported in a
large number of patients with MPDs, including IM (2–7). A
substantial amount of evidence has been generated which indicates
that these somatic mutations play a significant role in the
pathobiology of the MPDs. In addition to these genetic mechanisms, a growing number of investigators have provided data which
indicate that epigenetic mechanisms silence genes that impede
cellular proliferation or movement in IM (19–21). Rossi et al. (39)
have reported aberrant methylation of a variety of negative
regulators of JAK2 activation/phosphorylation, including SHP-1,

both JAK2V617F-positive or JAK2V617F-negative IM. Furthermore,
Opalinska et al. did high-resolution epigenomic mapping of IM
cells, and revealed high levels of functionality important methylation. This high rate of methylation in IM suggests that epigenetic

silencing of genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis
of this disorder (40).
Other modifications of the chromatin structure have been
associated with gene silencing. For instance, removal of acetyl
groups from histone lysine tails is associated with transcriptional

Figure 2. A–D, functional expression of CXCR4 by IM CD34+ cells following exposure to chromatin-modifying agents. A, after ex vivo culture in the presence of
cytokines alone, the proportion of CD34+CXCR4+ cells increased as compared with primary CD34+ cells (n = 9). The addition of 5azaD/TSA led to an even
greater increase in the expression of CXCR4 (n = 13; P = 0.006). B, 5azaD/TSA-treated CD34+ cell population also had the highest MFI of CXCR4 as compared
with primary CD34+ cells (n = 9) or CD34+ cells exposed to cytokines alone (n = 13; P = 0.021). C, up-regulation of CXCR4 mRNA expression occurred in the
5azaD/TSA-treated CD34+ cells (n = 8). Total RNA was extracted from reisolated CD34+ cells after 9 d of culture in the presence of cytokines alone or cytokines
plus 5azaD/TSA treatment. The relative expression levels CXCR4 mRNA was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. h-Actin was used as internal calibrator
(control gene). A 3.16 F 1.14-fold increase in CXCR4 mRNA expression after 5azaD/TSA treatment (n = 8, paired-samples t test; P = 0.005) was observed as
compared with cultures containing cytokines alone. D, 5azaD/TSA-treated CD34+ cells had a greater migratory potential in response to SDF-1. CD34+ cells cultured in
the presence of cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA showed significantly higher migration ability as compared with CD34+ cells reisolated from cultures containing cytokines
alone (n = 6; P = 0.01) or primary CD34+ cells (n = 4).

Figure 3. Hematopoietic colony formation by CD34+ cells cultured in the
presence of 5azaD/TSA. The expansion of progenitor cells after ex vivo culture
was determined by dividing the number of colonies assayed from cultures
done in the presence of cytokines alone or cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA by the
number of input primary CD34+ cells. The number of granulocyte-macrophage

silencing (22–30). In cultures of cancer cells, the administration of
HDAC inhibitors will not result frequently in the re-expression of
densely hypermethylated genes unless DNMT inhibitors are first
given; the two inhibitors are then synergistic for re-expression of
genes (27). In myeloid malignancies, the use of chromatinmodifying agents that target epigenetically silenced transcription
may activate a genetic progress, leading to cellular differentiation,

apoptosis, or senescence, allowing normal stem cells to replace the
molecular stem cell populations (27, 30). The sequential application
of HDAC inhibitors following DNMT inhibitors have been proposed
to potentially increase the response rate, response duration, or
percentage of complete remissions in myeloid leukemia by
promoting the re-expression of important silenced regulatory
genes that might have a profound antitumor effect or lead to the
induction of cellular differentiation (30). Because effective therapeutic options for the treatment of patients with IM are few, we
have explored the potential role of chromatin-modifying agents in
the treatment of IM using an in vitro culture system.
Our laboratory has previously reported that the sequential use of
chromatin-modifying agents has a profound effect on normal
HSCs, resulting in their ability to undergo symmetrical cell division
with retention of their marrow-repopulating potential (32–34).
Unlike malignant cells, the addition of sequential 5azaD/TSA in the
presence of a cytokine cocktail favors the division of normal
primitive HPCs which retain their marrow-repopulating potential.
This behavior is in contrast to stem cells exposed in vitro to
cytokines alone which undergo progressive loss of their proliferative and self-renewal capacity. Sequential treatment of normal
stem cells with 5azaD/TSA results in the up-regulation of
expression of number of genes previously implicated in HSCs
self-renewal (34). Reversal of the sequence of the administration of
these two agents has, however, resulted in the loss of their effects
on the behavior of normal CD34+ cells (33). The effects of
chromatin-modifying agents on myeloid neoplasias could, therefore, be due not only to their causing cytotoxicity and terminal
differentiation of malignant cells, but also preferential expansion of
the pool of residual normal stem cells.
In the present report, we showed that the in vitro administration
of sequential 5azaD/TSA had a profound effect on IM CD34+ cells.
The effects of these chromatin-modifying agents were different
from that observed when normal CD34+ cells were treated in an
identical manner. 5azaD/TSA resulted not only in a dramatic
reduction in the number of assayable IM progenitor cells, but also
in the numbers of CD34+ cells and CD34+CD90+ cells. The burden
of progenitor cells belonging to the malignant clone in IM was

Figure 4. JAK2V617F mutational analysis
of IM hematopoietic colonies using nested
allele-specific PCR. A, a high percentage
of JAK2V617F homozygous colonies
(++; only mutational band and no wild-type
band) was observed in colonies assayed
from primary IM PB CD34+ cells.
B, heterozygous colonies (+/; mutational
band and wild-type band) appeared in
cultures exposed to cytokines alone.
C, wild-type, heterozygous, and
homozygous colonies were present in

tracked using quantitative PCR of JAK2V617F alleles in patients
with JAK2V617F mutation or by monitoring the persistence of
cytogenetic abnormalities using FISH analysis of hematopoietic
colonies cloned from CD34+ cells isolated from patients with
JAK2V617F-negative IM. Using both strategies, we showed that
sequential 5azaD/TSA treatment resulted in a reduction in the
numbers of malignant progenitor cells. The data generated by
monitoring the number of assayable progenitors that were
JAK2V617 positive were especially revealing. In five of the six
patients studied, primary CD34+ cells produced not only in vitro
hematopoietic colonies that were homozygous for JAK2V617F, but
also a fraction that contained cells that were heterozygous for
JAK2V617F or contained wild-type JAK2. By contrast, in another
patient (IM12), all of the hematopoietic colonies were JAK2V617F
homozygous. These data indicate that JAK2V617F-positive IM
resembles PV in that JAK2V617F homozygous clones may
predominate with time. The treatment of IM CD34+ cells with
cytokines alone did not substantially change the percentage of
JAK2V617F colonies or the numbers of homozygous colonies. By
contrast, treatment with cytokines and sequential 5azaD/TSA
resulted in a reduction of the percentage of JAK2V617F-positive
colonies in five of six patients and the appearance of greater
numbers of colonies with wild-type JAK2 which likely represents
the progeny of a normal reservoir of progenitor cells. Furthermore,
in three of the six patients, the treatment of IM CD34+ cells with
chromatin-modifying agents resulted in the reduction of the
proportion of JAK2V617F homozygous colonies. This preferential
suppression of the numbers of JAK2V617F homozygous colonies by
treatment with chromatin-modifying agents could be due to either
their preferential elimination by a direct cytotoxic effect of the drug
or the increased expression of previously suppressed genes that
results in the transcription of gene products that leads to cell death
or loss of their proliferative advantage as compared with JAK2V617F
heterozygous progenitor cells or wild-type progenitor cells.
The constitutive mobilization of CD34+ cells is a defining
characteristic of IM, which results ultimately to the development of
extramedullary hematopoiesis (1, 10). Our laboratory has previously reported that IM CD34+ cells are characterized by the
reduced expression of the chemokine receptor, CXCR4 (14, 18).
Because CXCR4/SDF-1 interactions are thought to play a role in

normal stem cell trafficking, the reduction of IM CD34+ CXCR4
expression has been hypothesized to contribute to this abnormal
stem cell trafficking. Rosti et al. have shown that transcriptional
defects are the major cause of the CXCR4 down-regulation in
IM (18). CXCR4 down-regulation on IM CD34+ cells is associated
with advanced patient age, the presence of severe anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and degree of marrow fibrosis (18). Treatment
of IM CD34+ with cytokines plus 5azaD/TSA for 9 days was
associated with an increase in the numbers of CD34+ cells
expressing CXCR4 as well as an increased density of CXCR4.
In vitro exposure of normal stem/progenitor cells to cytokines has
been previously reported to up-regulate both cell surface and
intracellular CXCR4, restoring their migratory behavior toward
SDF-1 (41). 5azaD/TSA treatment resulted in a far more dramatic
(5-fold) increase in CXCR4 expression by IM CD34+ cells than was

associated with the exposure of IM CD34+ cells to cytokines. This
increase in IM CD34+ cells CXCR4 expression was also associated
with increased migration capacity of drug-treated CD34+ cells
toward SDF-1. This increased expression of functional CXCR4 by
IM CD34+ cells was attributed to increased transcription of CXCR4
in IM CD34+ cells treated with chromatin-modifying agents.
Epigenetic regulation of CXCR4 in human tumors has been
previously recognized (42–44). Furthermore, constitutive as well
as inducible expression of CXCR4 has been reported to be restored
following the treatment of both pancreatic cancer cells as well as
human melanoma cells by chromatin-modifying agents (42, 43).
The up-regulation of CXCR4 expression by IM CD34+ cells following
treatment with 5azaD/TSA treatment shows an important
epigenetic mechanism that may endogenously regulate chemokine
receptor expression in IM CD34+ cells.
The findings in this report, therefore, provide a rationale for the
use of chromatin-modifying agents to treat patients with IM in a

manner that may potentially alter its natural history. A clinical trial
to determine if the sequential administration of a DNMT inhibitor
followed by a HDAC inhibitor could be tolerated by IM patients is
of great importance. Furthermore, such a trial might determine if
the up-regulation of CXCR4 by IM CD34+ cells, as well as the
reduction of the numbers of JAK2V617F progenitor cells, could be
achieved in patients by the administration of these agents and
would alter the natural history of this hematologic malignancy.
