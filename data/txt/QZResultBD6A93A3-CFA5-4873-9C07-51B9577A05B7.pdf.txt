Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of
TSU68 [(Z)-5-[(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-3H-indol-3-ylidene)methyl]2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-propanoic acid; SU6668], an inhibitor
of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, plateletderived growth factor receptor B, and fibroblast growth factor
receptor 1 (FGFR1), on colon cancer liver metastasis, and to
test the hypothesis that TSU68 modulates the microenvironment in the liver before the formation of metastasis. First, we
implanted the highly metastatic human colon cancer TK-4
orthotopically into the cecal walls of nude mice, followed by
twice-daily administration of TSU68 (400 mg/kg/d) or vehicle.
Five weeks of treatment with TSU68 significantly inhibited
liver metastasis compared with the control group (P < 0.001).
Next, we analyzed the gene expression profile in premetastatic
liver using microarrays. Microarray and quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR analysis showed that mRNA levels for the
chemokine CXCL1 were significantly increased in tumorbearing mice compared with non–tumor-bearing mice.
Moreover, CXCL1 expression was significantly decreased by
TSU68 treatment. CXCR2 expression was detected predominantly on tumor cells in orthotopic tumors compared with
ectopic tumors. The number of migrating neutrophils in
premetastatic liver was significantly decreased in the TSU68treated group (P < 0.001). The amount of interleukin-12
(IL-12) p40 in the portal vein was significantly decreased by
TSU68 (P = 0.02). Blockade of both CXCR2 and IL-12 p40 with
a neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited liver metastasis.
These results suggest that the CXCL1/CXCR2 axis is important
in cancer metastasis and that TSU68 may modulate the
premetastatic niche in the target organ through suppression
of the inflammatory response, which might be an alternative
mechanism used by antiangiogenic agents. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The idea of targeting angiogenesis to treat tumors was first
proposed more than 30 years ago (1). Since then, several approaches
to block or disrupt tumor angiogenesis have been explored. Finally,

in 2004, it was shown that the addition of bevacizumab, a
humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF)-A, to conventional chemotherapy prolonged
survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer compared
with chemotherapy alone in a randomized, controlled phase III
clinical trial (2). The original concept of antiangiogenesis was
the inhibition of outgrowth of new blood vessels (3); however, it
became more obvious that bevacizumab may affect the vasculature
through various mechanisms: It (a) causes regression of the tumor
vasculature, (b) normalizes the tumor vasculature, (c) inhibits the
formation of new blood vessels, and (d) prevents recruitment of
progenitor cells from the bone marrow (3–6). Understanding of
these detailed mechanisms provided the rationale for combination
therapy using antiangiogenic agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy
(4, 7). Nowadays, various other kinds of antiangiogenic agents, such
as anti-VEGF receptor antibodies (8), soluble VEGF receptors (9),
and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (10), have been
developed. In particular, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are
small, synthetic, selective molecules that have favorable toxicity
profiles, do not induce an immune response, and have an ability to
inhibit multiple receptors simultaneously (11).
TSU68 [(Z)-5-[(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-3H-indol-3-ylidene)methyl]2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-propanoic acid; SU6668] is a potent
antiangiogenic agent that targets multiple tyrosine kinase receptors
for VEGFR2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor h (PDGFRh),
and FGFR1 (12). Therefore, TSU68 can target not only endothelial
cells (via VEGFR2, FGFR1, and PDGFRh) but also tumor cells (via
FGFR1 and PDGFRh) and surrounding stromal cells (via PDGFRh
on pericytes or FGFR1 on fibroblasts; ref. 13). The strong potency
of TSU68 for preventing colon cancer liver metastasis has been
shown previously in some preclinical models (13–15); however,
the detailed mechanisms by which TSU68 suppresses tumor
metastases remain unclear.
Cancer metastasis depends on the interaction of tumor cells
with the microenvironment at the site of metastasis (16). Recently,
extensive studies have suggested that chemokines produced in
metastatic organs may play a major role in mediating tumor
metastasis (17–20). Moreover, tumor-associated cells, such as
macrophages and hematopoietic bone marrow progenitors,
prepare the ‘‘niche’’ in premetastatic organs and thus enhance
metastasis (21–23). From these recent observations, we speculated
that TSU68 might modulate the microenvironment in the liver
before the formation of metastasis.
In this study, we showed the effect of TSU68 in preventing colon
cancer liver metastasis using an orthotopic implantation model.
Furthermore, to elucidate the possible role of this agent in
modulating the premetastatic microenvironment in the liver, we
analyzed the gene expression profile of liver in the premetastatic
phase using GeneChip microarrays.

TSU68 Modulates the Premetastatic Niche

Materials and Methods

Microarray Analyses

Animals and Tumor Models
The following experiments were done according to the guidelines of the
Committee on Experimental Animals of Hamamatsu University School of
Medicine. TSU68 was kindly provided by Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. TK-4 is a
solid tumor tissue strain with strong liver metastatic potential, which was
derived from a human colon carcinoma obtained from a surgically resected
specimen in our institution. TK-001, used as another model of colon
carcinoma, has no liver metastasis ability. TK-4 was implanted orthotopically into cecal walls by suturing 120-mg tumor pieces with 6-0 Polysorb
(Tyco Healthcare) or transplanting them s.c. into the right axillary regions of
6-wk-old male BALB/c nu/nu mice (Clea Japan), as previously described
(24–27).
Treatment protocol 1. The animals were treated with TSU68 (400 mg/
kg/d, twice daily, p.o.; n = 19) or vehicle (n = 19) from 7 d after orthotopic
implantation. We defined the day on which treatment was initiated as day 0
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). After 5 wk of drug administration, mice were
sacrificed and tumors were removed and weighed. Metastatic foci on the
liver surface were counted macroscopically and were confirmed microscopically, as reported previously (28, 29).
Treatment protocol 2. Six-week-old mice received TK-4 tumor
implantation orthotopically as described above or a sham operation in
which the cecum was stitched with 6-0 Polysorb, without tumor tissue.
From 1 wk after the operation, treatment with TSU68 or vehicle was
initialized as in protocol 1 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). At days 4 and 7, mice
were sacrificed and samples were removed. Livers were extracted from the
left lateral lobe because metastasis is often observed in this area. All
samples were fixed in formalin or treated with RNAlater (Applied
Biosystems) for further analyses.

Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical analysis of Ki67, CD34, CXCL1, and CK20,
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (thickness, 4 Am) were used.
For Mac-1 (CD11b) and NIMP R-14 staining, frozen sections were used.
After irradiation in a hydrated autoclaving device at 121jC for 15 min in
10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) to remove the masking effect of
formalin fixation, the slides were rinsed with PBS and incubated with
0.3% H2O2 in absolute methanol for 10 min to quench endogenous
peroxidase activity. After another washing step with PBS, antimouse CD34
antibody (1:50; Abcam), antihuman Ki67 antibody (1:50; DAKO),
antimouse CXCL1 antibody (1:50; Abcam), antimouse NIMP-R14 antibody
(1:100; Abcam), antimouse Mac-1 antibody (1:100; BD Pharmingen), or
antihuman CK20 (1:50; DAKO) was applied. Immunocomplexes were
detected with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies, streptavidinconjugated horseradish peroxidase, and diaminobenzidine, using Histofine
(Nichirei). The sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and
mounted with a permanent mounting medium. TIFF images were
obtained with a digital microscope BZ-8000 (Keyence) and converted
into gray-scale images with Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1 (Adobe Systems, Inc.)
for the extraction of stained areas. For microvessel density quantitation,
the size of the CD34-positive area was determined by use of Scion Image
software (Scion).4 Tumor cell density was evaluated by calculating the size
of the CK20-positive area per high-power field (HPF) using the same
methods. For the evaluation of CXCL1 and CD11b, the number of positive
cells in 10 HPFs was counted under a light microscope at 400
magnification. For the evaluation of Ki67 labeling index, the ratio between
the numbers of Ki67-positive cells and all tumor cells was calculated in 10
HPFs at 400 magnification.

RNA Extraction
Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers or cecal tumors using an
Isogen kit (Wako), following purification with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).

Biotin-labeled complementary RNA was synthesized from 5 Ag of total
RNA using the One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit and the GeneChip IVT
Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
labeled complementary RNA samples were hybridized to the complete
Affymetrix mouse genome 430A 2.0 GeneChip set (Affymetrix). Signal
intensities were detected using an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner and
analyzed using GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 (Agilent). Three chips per group were
hybridized, and the mean value was used for data comparison. Changes in
gene expression of >2-fold were defined as significant.

Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis
Total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with random
hexanucleotide primers and SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase II (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR using the RotorGene 3000 System (Corbett Research) and a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR
kit (Qiagen; ref. 30). The primer sequences were as follows: 5¶-GCTGGGATTCACCTCAAGAA-3¶ and 5¶-TCTCCGTTACTTGGGGACAC-3¶ for mouse
CXCL1; 5¶-GCCTTCCGTGTTCCTACCC-3¶ and 5¶-TGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC-3¶ for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH);
5¶-CTGCATCAGTGACGGTAAAC-3¶ and 5¶-CCTTTGGGCTGTTGTGCTTA-3¶
for mouse stromal cell–derived factor 1 (SDF-1); 5¶-ACTCCAATAACAGCAGGTCAC-3¶ and 5¶-TCAAAGCTGTCACTCTCCATG-3¶ for human CXCR2; and
5¶-GGGCTGCTTTTAACTCTGGT-3¶ and 5¶-TGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCGC-3¶
for human GAPDH. Data were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels.

Reverse Transcription-PCR
cDNA was synthesized as described above, and human CXCR2 cDNA was
amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide primer pair 5¶-ACTCCAATAACAGCAGGTCAC-3¶ and 5¶-TCAAAGCTGTCACTCTCCATG-3¶. PCR products
were electrophoresed through 3.0% agarose gels containing ethidium
bromide.

Quantitative Analysis of Cytokines in Blood
Mice were treated in the same fashion described in protocol 2. Seven
days after the initial treatment with TSU68, mice were anesthetized with
ether and a midline incision was made in the upper abdomen. The portal
vein was carefully exposed. After cutting off the vessel, the blood flowing out
was suctioned and collected. Peripheral blood was obtained by pulling out
the eye ball. Blood samples were applied to a Bioplex Cytokine Assay System
(Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Treatment with Neutralizing Antibodies against Human
CXCR2 and Mouse Interleukin-12 p40 Subunit
Seven days after tumor implantation, an antihuman CXCR2 neutralizing
antibody (48311 clone; R&D Systems) was administrated i.p. at a dose of
20 Ag in 200 AL of PBS on alternate days (n = 10). The CXCR2 neutralizing
antibody has been shown to inhibit CXCR2 effectively when used at 20 Ag
per mouse (31). Antihuman IgG (20 Ag in 200 AL of PBS; R&D Systems) was
used as a control (n = 7). After 5 wk of treatment, mice were killed and the
livers collected for the evaluation of liver metastases. The antimouse
interleukin (IL)-12 p40 neutralizing antibody (C17.8 clone; R&D Systems)
was administrated i.p. at a total dose of 500 Ag (100 Ag in 200 AL of PBS
twice a week, total of five times; n = 9). Antimouse IgG (100 Ag in 200 AL of
PBS; R&D Systems) was used as a control (n = 6). Five weeks after the initial
treatment, mice were killed and the livers collected for the evaluation of
liver metastases and CXCL1 expression.

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean F SE. The statistical significance of
differences was assessed with the Student t test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

into the cecal walls of nude mice, and mice were treated with
TSU68 (200 mg/kg/d) or vehicle alone as a control. After 5 weeks of
treatment, the number of liver metastases was counted macroscopically and primary tumors were resected. As shown in Fig. 1A,
no visible liver metastasis was observed in TSU-treated mice,
whereas between one and four foci were seen (average, 1.28) in
control animals (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the liver metastases observed in control mice were
positive for human specific epithelial marker CK20 (Fig. 1B) and
thus those originated in transplanted human colon tumor. These
results suggest an antimetastatic effect of TSU68 on colon cancer
xenografts. The tumor cell density evaluated by human CK20
staining (Fig. 1C) was significantly lower in the TSU-treated group
(0.06 F 0.01 mm2) compared with the control group (0.15 F 0.01
mm2; Fig. 1D). Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 and CD34 revealed
a significant decrease in tumor cell proliferation and microvessel
density, respectively, at the primary site in the TSU-treated group
(Fig. 1C and D). Furthermore, the percentage of apoptotic cells in
the primary tumor was greater in the TSU-treated group than in
the control group (data not shown). These data suggest an
antitumor effect of TSU68 on colon cancer xenografts.
Gene expression changes in premetastatic livers (protocol 2).
Recently, some reports have emphasized the significance of microenvironmental changes in the metastatic site in advance of

metastatic development (21, 22). In the present study, it also seems
that TSU68 might alter the microenvironment in liver during the
premetastatic phase. To examine this possibility, we sought to
determine the premetastatic phase when micrometastasis has not
occurred in the liver but the primary tumor is growing. Two weeks
after tumor implantation, when the primary tumor had already
begun to grow, no micrometastasis was observed in mouse livers
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Therefore, we defined day 0 to day 7
(0–2 weeks after tumor implantation) as the premetastatic phase
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To address the genetic mechanisms by which TSU68 alters the
microenvironment in liver during the premetastatic phase, we
performed DNA microarray analyses. First, we established four
different groups of mice: non–tumor-bearing and treated with
vehicle alone (NT-Co), non–tumor-bearing and treated with TSU68
(NT-TSU), tumor-bearing and treated with vehicle (T-Co), and
tumor-bearing and treated with TSU68 (T-TSU; Fig. 2A). Non–
tumor-bearing mice were given a sham operation without tumor
implantation, as described in Materials and Methods. The
treatment was initialized 7 days after implantation in the same
fashion as protocol 1. At day 7, mouse livers in all groups were
resected and gene expression profiles were analyzed using
microarrays. We extracted 1,947 genes that were increased in the
T-Co group compared with the N-Co group and 700 genes that

were decreased by TSU68 treatment. We further extracted 44 genes
that showed a >2-fold difference in expression level (Table 1).
Among these genes, we focused on CXCL1, one of the CXC
chemokines, the expression level of which was decreased by about
a quarter by TSU68 treatment (Fig. 2B), because a number of
reports have shown that chemokines are closely related to cancer
metastasis (17, 32, 33). In microarray analysis, CXCL1 mRNA
expression was 4-fold increased in the liver of T-Co mice compared
with that of NT-Co mice, and this was suppressed by TSU68
treatment. CXCL1 mRNA expression was confirmed by quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and it was consistent with the
microarray data (Fig. 2C). The significant increase of CXCL1 mRNA
in the liver was also observed at day 4 (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
The inhibitory effect of TSU68 was not significant, but there was a
tendency toward inhibition at this time point. To determine
whether these changes could be observed in other models, TK001
strain, which is also a solid tissue strain of human colon carcinoma
with no ability of liver metastasis, was used. In the TK001 model,
CXCL1 mRNA was significantly increased in the liver of T-Co mice
compared with that of NT-Co (6-fold) at day 7, but TSU68 failed to
suppress this induction (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Interestingly,
CXCL1 mRNA expression was not affected in non–tumor-bearing
mice by TSU68 treatment, regardless of tumor type or time point
(Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Moreover, no significant
change of CXCL1 mRNA was observed in the lung during the same
phase (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). To address the

www.aacrjournals.org

mechanisms underlying CXCL1 induction in the liver, CXCL1
protein expression was evaluated. The immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that CXCL1-positive cells recruited into the
premetastatic liver were significantly increased in tumor-bearing
mice, and this was not observed when treated by TSU68 (Fig. 3A
and B). These data suggest that up-regulation of CXCL1 observed
specifically in the liver resulted from recruitment of CXCL1-positive
cells that can be inhibited by TSU68 treatment. We also assessed
mRNA expression of SDF-1, which is known as an important
chemokine involved in the formation of the premetastatic niche
(17–19). However, no significant changes were observed among the
four groups in this study (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Migration of neutrophils into premetastatic liver. The
primary function of CXCL1 is the chemoattraction and activation
of specific leucocytes expressing its receptor CXCR2 and the
subsequent induction of various immunoinflammatory responses
(32). To evaluate the neutrophil migration to the liver and the effect
of TSU68, we examined immunohistochemical staining of neutrophil-specific marker NIMP-R14. The number of migrating neutrophils in the liver was increased in T-Co mice compared with NT-Co,
and this was suppressed by TSU68 treatment (Fig. 3C and D). In
addition, CD11b staining revealed that the number of macrophages
recruited to the liver was also increased in T-Co mice compared
with NT-Co mice, and this was suppressed by TSU68 treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). These data suggest that the cecal
tumors recruit neutrophils as well as macrophages to the liver, and

TSU68 inhibits this recruitment. Furthermore, the CXCL1 protein
level in peripheral blood was significantly increased in tumorbearing mice (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B), suggesting that
CXCL1 in the bloodstream may be one of the factors that mobilize
neutrophils from bone marrow.
Expression of the CXCR2 gene in primary tumors. CXCL1 has
been shown to bind its receptor CXCR2 with high affinity (34).
CXCR2 on tumor cells is known to contribute to their growth,
survival, and motility (33). Thus, we confirmed the expression of
CXCR2 mRNA in primary cecal tumors by RT-PCR. Expression of
CXCR2 mRNA was observed in 8 of 14 (57.1%) samples from
primary cecal tumors (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, when TK-4 was
implanted into the subcutaneous space, its expression was
detected in only 1 of the 14 samples (7.1%; Fig. 4A). These results
indicate that the tumors are more likely to express CXCR2 mRNA
detectable by RT-PCR when implanted into orthotopic sites
compared with ectopic sites. The expression level of CXCR2 mRNA
in each tumor was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR, and as
expected, it was significantly increased in the cecal tumors
compared with the subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 4B).
Blocking CXCR2 with a neutralizing antibody. To clarify the
importance of the CXCL1/CXCR2 axis in the formation of
metastasis, we inhibited human CXCR2 on tumor cells with a
neutralizing antibody. After 5 weeks of treatment, we observed a
significant decrease in liver metastasis compared with the human
control IgG (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B). These data indicated
that the CXCL1/CXCR2 axis is important in the regulation of colon
cancer liver metastasis.
Quantitative determination of cytokines in the portal vein.
Blood from the cecum is carried to the liver through the portal
vein. Therefore, we speculated that some cytokines secreted by
primary tumors might flow to the liver via the portal vein, resulting
in an enhancement of metastasis, and that TSU might suppress this
process. To assess this hypothesis, we quantified cytokines in the
portal vein using a Multiplex Suspension Array System. Among
the 32 cytokines we analyzed, only the IL-12 p40 subunit was
significantly increased in the T-Co group, and this increase was
suppressed by TSU68 treatment (Fig. 5A and B). These results
suggest that the IL-12 p40 subunit secreted by primary tumors
might be involved in the process of liver metastasis, and that this
process could be impaired by TSU68 treatment.
Blocking the IL-12 p40 subunit with a neutralizing antibody.
Because IL-12 p40 has been shown to abrogate the antitumor
activity of IL-23, resulting in an enhanced tumorigenesis (35), and
induce the activation of nuclear factor-nB (36), which plays a
central role in the CXCL1 induction (37), blocking of p40 would be
considered to suppress tumor metastasis. To address this
possibility, we used an antimouse IL-12 p40 neutralizing antibody
in the TK-4 model. As expected, significant inhibition of liver
metastasis was observed following IL-12 p40 antibody treatment
compared with control IgG treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6C and
D). These data suggest that IL-12 p40 plays an important role in the
development of liver metastasis.

Discussion
The pathogenesis of cancer metastasis depends on the multiple
favorable interactions of metastatic cells with host homeostatic
mechanisms (16). In 1889, Paget described the concept of ‘‘seed’’
(tumor cell) and ‘‘soil’’ (specific organ) for the nonrandom
metastasis of breast cancer to specific organs (38). This theory

TSU68 Modulates the Premetastatic Niche

states that different organs provide growth conditions optimized
for specific cancers, and the outcome of metastasis depends on
multiple interactions of metastatic cells with homeostatic mechanisms, which the tumor cells can usurp (16). In our experiment,
CXCR2, which contributes to the growth, survival, and motility of
tumor cells, was more frequently expressed in tumors growing
in the cecum than in those growing in the subcutaneous space
(Fig. 4A and B). Greene and colleagues (39) reported that tumors
growing at orthotopic sites exhibit higher levels of epidermal
growth factor receptor, basic fibroblast growth factor, IL-8, type IV
collagenase, and the multidrug resistance (mdr-1) gene than those
growing in the subcutaneous space; this change in expression
would affect tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis. These
observations indicate that cancer cells can exhibit an innate
malignant phenotype when they grow in an optimal microenvironment, in which they can express various metastasis-related
factors including CXCR2. It is also suggested that orthotopic
implantation is mandatory for the assessment of cancer metastasis.
In 44 genes extracted from microarray data, which were
increased in mice in the tumor-bearing group and decreased in
those in the TSU68-treated group (Table 1), some of them are
metabolism-related genes, such as flavin-containing monooxyge-

nase 3 or squalene epoxidase. The expression changes of those
genes might be the effect of drug metabolism because TSU68 is
metabolized in the liver. Therefore, these genes were excluded for
further analysis. We also excluded genes that have not been
reported to be involved in cancer progression and metastasis.
Among the remaining chemokines, chemoattractants, and oncogenes, the chemokine CXCL1 showed the most marked fold change
following TSU68 treatment, so we focused on this factor for further
analysis.
CXCL1 is known to play a major role in inflammation, wound
healing, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis (40). It showed an f3fold increase at day 7 in the livers of TK-4-bearing mice, in concert
with CXCR2 expression in primary cecal tumors. We also showed
significant inhibition of liver metastasis by a CXCR2 neutralizing
antibody (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B). These observations
strongly suggest that the CXCL1/CXCR2 axis plays an important
role in cancer progression and metastasis. Moreover, we also
observed the up-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9, which are
known to act as strong chemoattractants for monocytes and
neutrophils (41), in premetastatic liver (Table 1). Hiratsuka
and colleagues showed that VEGF-A, transforming growth factor
h, and tumor necrosis factor a, which are released from primary

tumor cells, induce the expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in lung
endothelium and myeloid cells, thereby facilitating the homing of
tumor cells to the premetastatic sites within the lung parenchyma.
Their results suggest that tumor metastasis may be dependent on a
selective induction of organ-specific chemoattractants, which can
be induced by specific soluble factors released from the primary
tumors. In the present study, we observed an elevated level of
IL-12 p40 subunit in the portal veins of tumor-bearing mice
(Fig. 5A and B) and the antimetastatic effect of antimouse IL-12
p40 neutralizing antibody (Supplementary Fig. S6C and D). IL-12
p40 is known to act as an antagonist of IL-23 and abrogates IL-23–
mediated antitumor effects (35). It is also reported that IL-12 p40
can induce the activation of nuclear factor-nB (36), which plays a
central role in the induction of CXCL1 (37). These data support our
hypothesis that IL-12 p40 may play an important role in the
development of metastasis by inducing CXCL1. In the present
study, however, we could not confirm the suppression of CXCL1 in
the liver by IL-12 p40 neutralization (data not shown). Although
further verifications are needed, treatments targeting IL-12 p40
may have potential for the prevention of liver metastasis.
Moreover, it is also suggested from recent observations that
other soluble factors might be involved in the establishment of the
premetastatic niche. In a previous study, we confirmed that TK-4
expresses VEGF-A, cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2 (24), and the
active form of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (42). COX-2 expression
was significantly up-regulated in the orthotopically implanted
tumors and was positively correlated with the number of liver
metastases (24). Kaplan and colleagues (23) have shown that VEGF
and placental growth factor derived from tumor cells up-regulate
fibronectin in resident fibroblasts, which results in the activation of
VEGFR1-positive hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells in
premetastatic organs, providing a permissive niche for incoming

tumor cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that various
tumor-derived soluble factors provide a premetastatic niche in
target organs to facilitate the homing of cancer cells, which is vital
for the development of cancer metastasis.
We have also shown that TSU68 significantly suppresses CXCL1
expression in the premetastatic liver. TSU68 also decreased S100A8
and A9 expression (Table 1). The reduction in the levels of these
chemokines/chemoattractants may lead to a suppression of the
homing of CXCR2-expressing neutrophils and tumor cells to the
liver. Fidler (16) emphasized that therapy for metastasis should be
targeted not only against tumor cells but also against the host
microenvironment that contributes to and supports the progressive growth and survival of metastatic cancer cells. Our results may
indicate that antiangiogenic agents can modulate the microenvironment in target organs through suppression of the inflammatory
response, leading to marked inhibition of liver metastasis, which
may be an alternative mechanism of action used by these agents.
The mechanism by which TSU68 suppresses CXCL1 expression
in the liver remains to be elucidated; however, it can be explained
by several hypotheses. First, the number of tumor cells and
endothelial cells that can produce various cytokines might be
reduced by TSU68 treatment. The marked decrease in tumor cell
density and microvessel density in the primary tumors observed in
this study (Fig. 1C and D) might reflect such a reduction. A second
possibility is that TSU68 might reduce the influx of these cytokines
into drainage vessels. Jain and colleagues (7, 43, 44) have argued
that anti-VEGF therapies can reduce interstitial fluid pressure and
decrease the shedding of metastatic cells and growth factors out
of tumors through a vascular normalization mechanism. Indeed,
in our preliminary data, TSU68 could induce tumor vessel
normalization and reduce interstitial fluid pressure (data not
shown). In addition, we have shown that the protein level of the

samples from the cecal tumors, whereas its
expression was detected in only 1 of 14

the subcutaneous space. B, quantitative

TSU68 Modulates the Premetastatic Niche

IL-12 p40 subunit in portal veins was decreased by TSU68 (Fig. 5A
and B). These results suggest that TSU68 might suppress the influx
of various cytokines into the drainage vessels by means of the
vascular normalization mechanism. Third, TSU68 might directly
target the bone marrow–derived endothelial progenitor cells
recruited into premetastatic liver, resulting in a decrease in their
production of CXCL1. Gao and colleagues have reported that
endothelial progenitor cells are involved in the angiogenic switch
in lung metastasis (45). They mentioned that the efficacy of
antiangiogenic inhibitors in patients with metastatic tumors may
be a consequence of directly targeting bone marrow–derived
endothelial progenitor cells as well as the nascent tumor
vasculature. In their report, CXCL1 expression was up-regulated
f2.5-fold in tumor-recruited bone marrow–derived endothelial
progenitor cells. It is necessary to address the role of bone
marrow–derived endothelial progenitor cells in liver metastasis
and whether TSU68 could target bone marrow–derived endothelial
progenitor cells directly.
In summary, we have shown that the CXCL1/CXCR2 axis has an
important role in colon cancer liver metastasis and that TSU68
significantly inhibits CXCL1 expression in the premetastatic liver,
leading to a marked inhibition in liver metastasis. These results
suggest that antiangiogenic agents can modulate the premetastatic
niche in target organs. Interruption of these interactions between
the tumor cells and the host environment by antiangiogenic agents
can lead to the inhibition or regression of cancer metastasis. These
results provide a new rationale for the use of antiangiogenic agents
to treat cancer metastasis and may lead to development of new
strategies aimed at targeting premetastatic niches.
