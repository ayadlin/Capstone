metastasis in cancer, provide a soil that is particularly favorable to
the progression of cancer cells. They are a reservoir of numerous
stimulatory cytokines and growth factors and provide a sanctuary
against the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy (5, 6). The bone
marrow contains two distinct populations of stem cells that
contribute to cancer progression. The first consists of hematopoietic stem cells located in the endosteal niche. When mobilized
toward the vascular niche, these cells mature into vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1– and VEGFR-2–
expressing cells, which are recruited by the primary tumor where
they contribute to inflammation and vascularization. VEGFR-1–
positive cells also colonize distant organs where they form
premetastatic niches (7). The second population is made of
mesenchymal stem cells. These cells give rise to a broad spectrum
of stromal cells, including osteoblasts, osteocytes, chrondrocytes,
smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,
and cardiac muscle cells, and have the capacity to repair injured
tissues (8, 9). These cells express a variety of cell surface-associated
markers like STRO-1, CD105, CD44, and CD166 (10, 11). Their role
in cancer progression is still poorly understood.
Neuroblastomas are biologically heterogeneous tumors of neural
crest origin and represent the second most common solid tumor in
children (12). Despite major progress in our understanding of the
biology of this type of cancer and in the treatment of these patients
with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, and retinoic acid therapy (13), metastasis remains the
leading cause of morbidity and mortality. It is present in f60% of
children with neuroblastoma at the time of diagnosis, with the
most common sites of metastasis being the bone marrow, bone,
and liver (14). Bone metastasis in neuroblastoma is characterized
by the presence of osteolytic lesions caused by an increase in
osteoclast activation (15). We have previously reported that most
neuroblastoma cells do not produce osteoclast-activating factors
like parathyroid hormone–related peptide or receptor activator
of nuclear factor-nB ligand, which are typically produced by
metastatic breast cancer cells, but stimulate the production of
interleukin-6 (IL-6) by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), which
are a potent activator of osteoclasts (16).
IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that exerts its effect through
interaction with the IL-6 receptor complex composed of an a-chain
subunit (IL-6Ra/gp80) and a h-chain subunit (gp130; refs. 17, 18).
Whereas many cells express gp130, the expression of the IL-6Ra/
gp80 provides the specificity of the response to IL-6 (17). Binding
of IL-6 to its heterodimeric receptor leads to conformational
changes in the gp130 subunit, which, through activation of Janus
kinases (Jak), activates members of the signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) family of proteins and the
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk)-1/2 pathway (19–21).
IL-6Ra/gp80 can be present in a soluble form (sIL-6R) generated by

Abstract
Neuroblastoma, the second most common solid tumor in
children, frequently metastasizes to the bone marrow and the
bone. Neuroblastoma cells present in the bone marrow
stimulate the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSC) to activate osteoclasts. Here
we have examined whether stromal-derived IL-6 also has a
paracrine effect on neuroblastoma cells. An analysis of the
expression of IL-6 and its receptor, IL-6R, in 11 neuroblastoma
cell lines indicated the expression of IL-6 in 4 cell lines and of
IL-6R in 9 cell lines. Treatment of IL-6R–positive cells with
recombinant human IL-6 resulted in signal transducer and
activator of transcription-3 and extracellular signal–regulated
kinase-1/2 activation. Culturing IL-6R–positive neuroblastoma cells in the presence of BMSC or recombinant human
IL-6 increased proliferation and protected tumor cells from
etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas it had no effect on
IL-6R–negative tumor cells. In vivo, neuroblastoma tumors
grew faster in the presence of a paracrine source of IL-6. IL-6
induced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in neuroblastoma
cells with concomitant release of prostaglandin-E2, which
increased the expression of IL-6 by BMSC. Supporting a role
for stromal-derived IL-6 in patients with neuroblastoma bone
metastasis, we observed elevated levels of IL-6 in the serum
and bone marrow of 16 patients with neuroblastoma bone
metastasis and in BMSC derived from these patients.
Altogether, the data indicate that stromal-derived IL-6
contributes to the formation of a bone marrow microenvironment favorable to the progression of metastatic neuroblastoma. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):329–37]

Introduction
It has become increasingly apparent that factors that influence
the progression of cancer cells originate not only from genetic and
epigenetic alterations in malignant cells but also from interactions
between tumor cells and nonmalignant cells in the tumor
microenvironment (1–3). The tumor microenvironment not only
influences the growth of primary tumors but also plays a critical
role in the development of distant metastasis, a role initially
recognized more than 100 years ago by Paget (4). The bone marrow
and the bone, which are among the most common sites of

IL-6 and sIL-6R levels. Levels of hIL-6 and sIL-6R in the medium of
cultured cells and in the serum and supernatant of bone marrow samples of
patients with neuroblastoma were determined in triplicate aliquots by
ELISA according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Quantikine immunoassay
kit, R&D Systems).
Western blot. Equal amounts of protein (20 Ag) were loaded in each
well and electrophoresed in 0.1% SDS, 4% to 12% gradient acrylamide
gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were blotted on nitrocellulose
membranes by semi-dry blotting (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The presence
of immune complexes was identified by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham).
Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. For proliferation assays, cells
were cultured in six-well tissue culture plates at 2.5  104 per well. Cell
numbers were determined by trypsinization and counting in a hemocytometer. Alternatively, we used a colorimetric assay in the presence of
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTT; Promega). For cell cycle analysis, cells were pulsed with
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 40 min before being harvested and
incubated in the presence of an FITC anti-BrdUrd mAb and 7-amino
actinomycin D (7-AAD; BD Biosciences). For apoptosis assay, cells were
cultured in six-well plates (4.5  105 per well) for 48 h, washed with cold
PBS twice, and resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer. Annexin V and
propidium iodide staining were done according to the instructions of the
manufacturer (Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit II, BD Biosciences).
Caspase-3 activity was determined using the ApoTarget caspase-3/CPP32
colorimetric protease assay kit (Biosource International) on aliquots
containing 100 Ag of proteins.
Flow cytometry. Analyses were done using a FACScan flow cytometer
and the data were analyzed using the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences).
SAOS-2 human osteosarcoma cells (positive for IL-6Ra/gp80 and gp130)
and NIH 3T3 (negative) cells were used as control.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were cultured in Lab-Tek II 8 chamber
slides for 48 h at two different densities (2  104 and 1  105 per well). Cells
were washed and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 15% FCS in PBS for 5 min, before
being incubated with a goat anti-human IL-6 antibody (AF-206-NA, 1:100
dilution, R& D Systems) overnight at 4jC followed by a mouse anti-human
STRO-1 mAb for 3 h at 37jC. Dual immunofluorescence localization was
achieved in the presence of a secondary Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat
antibody and a FITC-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody at 1:300
dilution for 45 min in the dark at room temperature. After washing with
0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS thrice, slides were mounted with 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) containing Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories)
and photographed under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. Analysis was also
done on paraffin-embedded sections (4 Am) of bone marrow biopsies
from five patients with neuroblastoma bone marrow metastasis. Sections
were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated, and treated with an antigen
unmasking solution (citrate buffer, pH 6.0; Vector Laboratories) for 10 min
at 95jC. These sections were sequentially incubated in the presence of
a goat anti-human IL-6 antibody and a mouse anti-human tyrosine
hydroxylase mAb (dilution1:1,000; Pel-Freez Arkansas, LLC). After washing,
the slides were incubated in the presence of a FITC conjugated horse antimouse IgG antibody (dilution 1:2,000) and a Cy3-conjugated donkey antigoat IgG (dilution 1:800). The slides were mounted in DAPI containing
Vectashield medium.
Animal experiments. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice were injected s.c. with 5  105 of CHLA-255/Luc
mixed with 5  105 CHLA-225/IL-6 or 5  105 CHLA-255/control
neuroblastoma cells in the left and right posterior thoracic side. After
4 wk, mice were examined for bioluminescence as previously described
(24). Animal experiments were done according to a protocol approved by
institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee of Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles.
Statistical analysis. All assays were done in triplicate. Comparisons
between two groups were done by the unpaired Student t test and one-way
ANOVA using the Tukey method of multiple comparisons. All reported
P values are two sided.

either alternate splicing or proteolytic shedding of the membraneassociated receptor. It acts as an agonist and potentiates the
activity of IL-6 (22). Cells lacking IL-6Ra/gp80 can therefore
become sensitive to IL-6 in the presence of sIL-6R (23).
The observation that neuroblastoma cells increase the expression of IL-6 by BMSC raised the question whether IL-6, in addition
to activating osteoclasts, could also have a paracrine effect on
tumor cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. Supporting this concept, we show in this paper that neuroblastoma cells
respond to IL-6 and that IL-6 stimulation provides them with a
proliferative and a survival advantage.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures. Eleven cell lines with and without MYCN amplification
were obtained from Dr. C. Patrick Reynolds (Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles, Los Angeles, CA) with the exception of NB-19 cells, which were
obtained from RIKEN (BioResource Center). SAOS-2 and MG-63 human
osteosarcoma cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. CHLA-255/Luc expressing the firefly luciferase reporter gene
were used as previously reported (24). CHLA-255 cells overexpressing
human IL-6 (hIL-6) were obtained by incubating cells with the viral
supernatant of 293 FT cells expressing a lentivirus (pLenti4/TO/V5-DEST
vector; Invitrogen) in which hIL-6 cDNA was inserted using LR clonase. IL6–expressing cells were selected in the presence of zeocin. These cells
produced an average of 2.6 ng hIL-6/mL over 24 h. Human BMSC were
either purchased from ALLCells LLC or obtained from bone marrow
samples of patients with neuroblastoma enrolled by the Children’s
Oncology Group. These samples were infiltrated with neuroblastoma cells
(20% in sample NB-208 and 80% in sample NB-209). Mononuclear cells
were separated by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque
using a human mesenchymal stem cell enrichment cocktail according to a
previously reported procedure (25).
Reagents. Recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6), rhsIL-6R, and mouse
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against IL-6Ra/gp80 and gp130 were
purchased from R&D Systems. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against
phospho-STAT-3, STAT-3, phospho-Erk1/2, and Erk1/2 were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Mouse mAb against h-tubulin
and nonspecific mouse IgG were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. An
unconjugated antihuman STRO-1 mouse mAb was purchased from R&D
Systems. Phycoerythrin-conjugated antihuman CD166, FITC-conjugated
antihuman CD44, unconjugated antihuman CD34, and unconjugated
anti-CD105 mouse mAb were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies against IL-6Ra/gp80
and gp130 and phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse IgG were purchased
from BD Biosciences and used for fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase-1
inhibitor PD98059 and the Jak/STAT-3 inhibitor AG490 were purchased
from Calbiochem and stored as a 50 mmol/L stock solution in DMSO
at 20jC.
Reverse transcriptase-PCR. Two micrograms of RNA were reverse
transcribed with 200 units of Superscript III reverse-transcriptase (FirstStrand cDNA Superscript III Kit, Invitrogen) into cDNA in the presence of
0.5 nmol of oligo (dt) primer. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was done
in 50 AL of reaction volume containing 2 AL of cDNA, 500 nmol of the
corresponding primer sets, and 2 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The
following primer sets were used: IL-6, 5¶-TAGCCGCCCCACACAGACAG-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-GGCTGGCATTTGTGGTTGGG-3¶ (reverse); IL-6Ra/gp8,
5¶-CATTGCCATTGTTCTGAGGTTC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GTGCCACCCAGCCAGCTATC-3¶ (reverse); gp130, 5¶-GCAAGATGTTGACGTTGCAGAGACTTG-3 ( forward) and 5¶-GGGCATTCTCTGCTTCTACCCAGAC-3¶
(reverse); sIL-6R, 5¶-CAGCAGTTCAAGAAGACGTGGAAGCT-3¶ ( forward)
and 5¶-GTGCCACCCAGCCAGCTATC-3¶ (reverse), these primers recognize
the alternate spliced mRNA of IL-6R/gp80; and human glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, 5¶-ACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTCTT-3¶ ( forward)
and 5¶-TTCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGT-3¶ (reverse).

were undetected in unconcentrated serum-free medium (data not
shown). These data were validated in five cell lines [CHLA-171,
CHLA-255, SMS-SAN, SK-N-BE(2), and NB-19] by RT-PCR and
Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C).
Neuroblastoma cells respond to exogenous IL-6. We then
tested the response of these neuroblastoma cell lines to exogenous
IL-6 by examining the effect of rhIL-6 on STAT-3 and Erk1/2
activation, the two major signaling pathways downstream of IL-6.
In CHLA-255 cells, we observed activation of STAT-3 and Erk1/2 at
concentrations of rhIL-6 ranging from 10 to 100 ng/mL with a
maximum between 30 and 50 ng/mL of rhIL-6 (Fig. 1A). Activation
of STAT-3 and Erk1/2 occurred as early as 5 minutes after exposure
to rhIL-6 and was maximal at 30 minutes (Fig. 1B). A similar
activation of STAT-3 and Erk1/2 was observed with CHLA-171,
SMS-SAN, and SK-N-BE(2), but not with NB-19 cells that did not

Neuroblastoma cells express IL-6R in the absence of IL-6
and sIL-6R. To explore whether IL-6 could have a paracrine or
autocrine effect on neuroblastoma cells, we first examined the
expression of IL-6Ra/gp80, gp130, IL-6, and sIL-6R in 11 human
neuroblastoma cell lines by flow cytometry (IL-6Ra/gp80 and
gp130) and ELISA (IL-6 and sIL-6R). The data (Table 1;
Supplementary Fig. S1A) indicated the presence of the ubiquitous
gp130 receptor protein in all cell lines and the presence of the
IL-6Ra/gp80 protein in nine cell lines. In contrast, IL-6 was
detected in unconcentrated serum-free conditioned medium of
only four cell lines, and in two of these cell lines [CHLA-171 and
SK-N-BE(2)] the levels were <10 pg/mL. sIL-6R was not detected.
Concentration of the conditioned medium to 10 did not result in
the detection of IL-6 or sIL-6R in cell lines for which these proteins

used lysates from IFN-g–treated HeLa cells (Cell Signaling
Technology). B, cell lysates (20 Ag) of CHLA-255 cells

experiment from three separate experiments showing
similar results.

in a transwell chamber in the presence of BMSC proliferated at a
faster rate than when cultured alone (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our
previous report (16), we detected a progressive increase in IL-6
production in the supernatant of the cocultures (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Confirming that the growth stimulatory effect of BMSC
was mediated by IL-6, we found an absence of growth stimulation
in the presence of a blocking antibody against IL-6Ra/gp80
(Fig. 2A). In contrast, coculturing IL-6Ra/gp80–deficient NB-19
cells with BMSC had no effect on their rate of proliferation. We
then documented that rhIL-6 (10 ng/mL) stimulated the growth of
CHLA-255 cells both in the presence (Fig. 2B) and in the absence
of serum (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The growth stimulatory effect
of rhIL-6 was dose dependent at concentrations ranging between
1 and 104 pg/mL and was neutralized in the presence of a blocking
mAb against IL-6Ra/gp80 (Fig. 2C) that inhibited STAT-3 and
Erk1/2 activation (Supplementary Fig. S3D). In contrast, and as
anticipated, rhIL-6 had no growth stimulatory effect on NB-19 cells
(Fig. 2C). To confirm that IL-6 stimulated cell proliferation, we

express IL-6Ra/gp80 (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Activation of
STAT-3, but not Erk1/2, was enhanced by the addition of sIL-6R
(250 ng/mL), whereas activation of both signaling pathways was
inhibited by a blocking antibody against IL-6Ra/gp80. STAT-3
activation was abrogated in the presence of AG490 (50 Amol/L),
and Erk1/2 activation was blocked by PD98059 (100 Amol/L;
Fig. 1C and D). Altogether, the data indicate that treatment of
neuroblastoma cells that express IL-6Ra/gp80 and gp130 with
rhIL-6 stimulates signaling pathways known to be downstream of
its receptor, which suggests the presence of a functional receptor.
IL-6 produced by BMSC stimulates the proliferation of
IL-6R–positive, but not IL-6R–negative, neuroblastoma cells.
Because we had previously shown that human neuroblastoma cells
stimulate the expression of IL-6 by BMSC in cocultures (16), we
initially explored whether BMSC would affect the proliferation of
neuroblastoma cells in an IL-6–dependent manner. For these
experiments, we selected CHLA-255 (IL-6R positive) and NB-19
(IL-6R negative) cells. We observed that CHLA-255 cells cocultured

IL-6 Promotes Growth and Survival of Neuroblastoma Cells

indicated concentrations for 24 h and examined for apoptosis by Annexin V staining (top ) and caspase-3 activity (bottom ) as described in Materials and Methods.
Columns, mean of three separate samples; bars, SD. B, BMSC (2.5  104 cells per well) and CHLA-255 (top ) or NB-19 (bottom ; 1  105 cells per well) cells

when CHLA-255/Luc cells were coinjected with CHLA-255/IL-6
when compared with coinjection with CHLA-255/vector control
cells (Fig. 2D). The data point to IL-6 having a growth-stimulatory
activity on human neuroblastoma cells in vivo as in in vitro.
IL-6 protects neuroblastoma cells from drug-induced
apoptosis. It has been previously reported that the bone marrow
microenvironment is a known sanctuary for tumor cells and
protects them from the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic
agents (5). We therefore asked the question whether IL-6 could
contribute to this effect by protecting neuroblastoma cells from
drug-induced cytotoxicity. For these experiments, we selected
etoposide, a podophylotoxin derivative and topoisomerase inhibitor used in the conventional treatment of patients with advanced
neuroblastoma (26). We first showed that etoposide induced
apoptosis and increased caspase-3 activity in CHLA-255 cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Selecting a concentration of
etoposide of 0.25 Ag/mL, we then examined whether the apoptotic
effect of etoposide on neuroblastoma cells would be altered by the
presence of BMSC. For this experiment, we compared CHLA-255
(IL-6R-positive) and NB-19 (IL-6R-negative) cells. The data (Fig. 3B)
revealed a trend to a decrease in etoposide-induced apoptosis
when CHLA-255 cells were cocultured with BMSC that, however,
was not statistically significant but was eliminated on addition of
an anti–IL-6Ra/gp80 blocking antibody. There was no similar trend
with NB-19 cells. Coculturing CHLA-255 cells with BMSC also
inhibited the levels of caspase-3 activity in CHLA-255 cells exposed
to etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Considering that etoposide
also induced apoptosis in BMSC and therefore may have decreased
the production of IL-6 by these cells, the data suggested that IL-6
could have a protective effect on etoposide-induced apoptosis.

examined its effect on cell cycle and BrdUrd incorporation. These
experiments revealed an increased percent of BrdUrd-positive cells
in the presence of 10 ng/mL of IL-6 without an increase in
apoptotic (BrdUrd-negative, 7-AAD–positive) cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3C). This growth stimulatory effect seemed to be dependent
on Erk1/2 activation because it was inhibited in the presence of
PD98059 (Supplementary Fig. S3D) that blocked Erk1/2 phosphorylation. However, we could not rule out the possibility that STAT-3
activation provided an alternate signaling pathway because this
inhibitor, which blocked the proliferative effect on CHLA-255,
inhibited both Erk1/2 and STAT-3 phosphorylation. We finally
tested whether IL-6 could also have an autocrine growth
stimulatory activity on neuroblastoma cells that express both the
receptor and the cytokine. For this experiment, we tested the effect
of a blocking anti–IL-6Ra/gp80 antibody on the proliferation of
SK-N-RA cells that express IL-6R and IL-6 (Table 1). The data
indicated a significant inhibition of proliferation in the presence of
the blocking antibody when compared with cells incubated in
the presence of a nonspecific mouse IgG (Supplementary Fig. S3E).
Altogether, these data point to IL-6 having a growth stimulatory
effect on neuroblastoma cells in vitro.
Paracrine IL-6 stimulates the growth of CHLA-255 neuroblastoma cells in vivo. We then tested whether IL-6 could also
stimulate the proliferation of IL-6R–positive neuroblastoma cells
in vivo. For these experiments, we coinjected s.c. in NOD/SCID
mice CHLA-255/Luc cells with CHLA-255 cells expressing IL-6 as a
paracrine source of hIL-6 and used luciferin-induced bioluminescence to determine the effect of paracrine hIL-6 (made by CHLA255/IL-6 cells) on the proliferation of CHLA-255/Luc cells. The data
indicated a 5-fold increase in the average luminescence intensity

in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). The data are consistent
with the hypothesis that the induction of Cox-2 by IL-6 in
neuroblastoma cells contributes to an amplification loop where
IL-6–stimulated neuroblastoma cells secrete PGE2, further increasing IL-6 production by BMSC. To confirm this possibility, we tested
whether blocking PGE2 production in IL-6–treated neuroblastoma
cells by celecoxib would suppress their capacity to induce
expression in BMSC. The data (Fig. 4D) indicated a dose-dependent
inhibition of PGE-2 in the supernatant of celecoxib-treated CHLA255 cells and a loss of IL-6 mRNA expression in BMSC incubated
in the presence of the supernatant of celecoxib-treated CHLA-255
cells. Celecoxib also inhibited the amount of IL-6 present in the
supernatant of the cocultures.
IL-6 is produced by BMSC derived from patients with
metastatic bone marrow disease and is increased in the serum
and bone marrow of patients with neuroblastoma bone
metastasis. The data reported thus far were generated with
established neuroblastoma cell lines cultured in vitro. We
considered that it was important to obtain evidence that IL-6
also contributed to neuroblastoma progression in patients. To
accomplish this, we first examined the expression of IL-6 in bone
marrow biopsies obtained from five patients with neuroblastoma
bone metastasis by dual immunofluorescence to confirm the
stromal origin of IL-6. The data (Fig. 5A) indicated that IL-6 was
expressed in tyrosine hydroxylase–negative stromal cells located
around tyrosine hydroxylase–positive tumor cells. However, it was

To confirm this possibility, we examined the effect of rhIL-6 on
etoposide-induced apoptosis in CHLA-255 and NB-19 cells. The
data showed that exposure of CHLA-255 to rhIL-6 before treatment
with etoposide significantly inhibited apoptosis, whereas it had no
significant effect on NB-19 cells (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S4B).
The data thus indicate that through the production of IL-6, BMSC
protect IL-6R–positive neuroblastoma cells from the cytotoxic
effect of etoposide.
Cyclooxygenase-2 induced by IL-6 in neuroblastoma cells
provides an amplification loop for IL-6 expression. Because we
had previously reported that the stimulation of IL-6 expression
in BMSC by neuroblastoma cells is adhesion independent, we
looked for the presence of a soluble factor in the medium of
neuroblastoma cells that stimulates IL-6 expression. IL-6 has been
shown to stimulate cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression and,
concomitantly, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a secreted product of
Cox-2 activity. PGE2 is also known to stimulate IL-6 expression (27).
Therefore, we tested whether IL-6 would affect Cox-2 expression in
neuroblastoma cells. This experiment indicated an absence of
expression of Cox-2 in neuroblastoma cells under basal conditions,
but an induction of expression in the presence of rhIL-6 (10 ng/mL)
that was abrogated in the presence of an anti–IL-6Ra/gp80
blocking antibody (Fig. 4A). Induction of Cox-2 expression by
IL-6 was concomitantly associated with an increase in the amount
of PGE2 secreted in the culture medium (Fig. 4B). We then showed
that treatment of BMSC with PGE2 increased the expression of IL-6

Discussion

not possible to show that these cells represent mesenchymal stem
cells. We therefore decided to isolate BMSC from the bone
marrow of two patients with metastatic disease. After isolation
and passage in culture, we obtained adherent cells that expressed
several mesenchymal markers like STRO-1 (76.2%), CD105 (89.4%),
CD166 (99.9%), and CD44 (99.4%) as determined by FACS analysis.
These cells also expressed IL-6 as documented by dualimmunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S4C). IL-6 was detected
in the culture medium of these cells after several passages in
culture, and its concentration was increased by 2- to 3-fold in the
presence of 50 concentrated culture medium from CHLA-255
cells (Fig. 5B). These data provide evidence that BMSC are a
source of IL-6 in the bone marrow of patients with neuroblastoma. Additional evidence that induction of IL-6 in the bone
marrow microenvironment is an important mediator of neuroblastoma progression and bone metastasis was obtained by
measuring the levels of IL-6 in 16 patients with neuroblastoma
bone metastasis (Fig. 5C). Whereas we did not detect IL-6 in the
serum and bone marrow supernatant of normal individuals, the
mean levels of IL-6 were 97.9 pg/mL in the bone marrow
supernatant (n = 8) and 14.6 pg/mL in the serum (n = 16) of these
patients. Altogether, these data, providing evidence that IL-6 is
increased in patients with metastatic neuroblastoma, support our
in vitro observations and are consistent with the concept that
stromal-derived IL-6 in the bone marrow contribute to a
microenvironment that promotes the proliferation and survival
of neuroblastoma cells.

In this article, we show that IL-6 expressed by BMSC has a
paracrine effect on neuroblastoma cells, stimulating their proliferation and protecting them from drug-induced apoptosis. We also
provide evidence for the presence of a Cox-2–dependent amplification loop that enhances the expression of IL-6 by BMSC in the
presence of neuroblastoma cells. Finally, supporting a role for IL-6
in patients with neuroblastoma bone metastasis, we document that
BMSC isolated from patients with neuroblastoma bone marrow
metastasis express IL-6 and that patients with neuroblastoma bone
metastasis have elevated levels of IL-6 in their serum and bone
marrow.
It has been well recognized, in particular in multiple myeloma,
that the interaction between stromal cells and tumor cells in the
bone marrow contributes to tumor progression (6). For example,
adhesion of myeloma cells to BMSC through members of the
cell adhesion molecules family of proteins or integrins induces
the expression of IL-6 by BMSC (28). Our data show a similar
contribution of BMSC and IL-6 to the progression of neuroblastoma in the bone marrow, but point to an important difference.
Whereas in myeloma the induction of IL-6 by BMSC requires cellcell contact, in neuroblastoma contact between tumor cells and
BMSC is not required. Our data indicate that the release of PGE2 by
IL-6–stimulated neuroblastoma cells is one of the soluble factors
that contribute to the production of IL-6 by BMSC by contributing
to an amplification loop. However, other soluble factors can
contribute, and we have recently shown that galectin-3–binding

cultured from the bone marrow of two patients with metastatic
disease express IL-6 and that the expression is enhanced in the
presence of supernatant from neuroblastoma cells. The data thus
support the concept that BMSC are an important source of IL-6 in
the bone marrow, but do not exclude the possibility that other
nonmalignant cells also contribute. Further evidence supporting a
role of IL-6 in bone metastasis in neuroblastoma was obtained by
finding elevated levels of IL-6 in the serum and bone marrow of
patients with neuroblastoma bone metastasis. Elevated levels of
IL-6 in the serum of patients with other cancers, such as myeloma,
melanoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and prostate and colon carcinomas, have been reported to correlate with a more severe outcome
(40–43). Whether IL-6 levels in patients with neuroblastoma are
indicators of poor clinical outcome will require a larger study.
Altogether, the data indicate that stromal-derived IL-6 in patients
with neuroblastoma marrow metastasis is an important contributor to tumor progression.
The data raise the possibility that IL-6 could be a valuable
therapeutic target in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.
Several agents targeting IL-6 have been developed and some are
currently being tested in clinical trials in inflammatory diseases
and malignancies. Tocilizumab, a humanized antibody against
IL-6R (44), has been successfully used in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (45) and in children with systemic onset of juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis (46). It is approved for the treatment of
Castleman’s disease, a lymphoproliferative disease associated with
elevated levels of IL-6. More recently, a genetically engineered form
of this antibody suitable for delivery by gene therapy has been
shown to be effective in an IL-6–dependent multiple myeloma cell
line in vivo (47). mAb against IL-6 is also currently being tested in
clinical trials in myeloma in combination with melphalan and
dexamethasone (48). Targeting IL-6–mediated Jak2/STAT-3 with
small molecules, such as capsacin and SD1008, is another approach
currently being tested in preclinical models of multiple myeloma
(49) and ovarian cancer (50). Our data support the testing of IL-6–
targeted therapies in clinical trials in children with advanced
neuroblastoma.

protein, a glycosylated protein produced by neuroblastoma cells
that binds to galectin-3, a receptor present on BMSC, also
stimulates IL-6 expression by BMSC (29).
The effect of IL-6 on neuroblastoma cell proliferation has been
the subject of previously conflicting reports. A growth-promoting
activity of IL-6 and sIL-6R in human and murine neuroblastoma
cells was initially reported (30, 31), whereas other investigators
reported that MYCN overexpression down-regulates IL-6 in the
SH-EP007 neuroblastoma cell line. They also showed that IL-6
does not inhibit neuroblastoma cell proliferation but inhibits
endothelial cell proliferation via the STAT-3 pathway and VEGFinduced neovascularization in the rabbit cornea assay (32). Our
data, which show an increase in cell proliferation and an increase
in BrdUrd incorporation in association with Erk1/2 activation, are
consistent with IL-6 having a growth stimulatory effect on
neuroblastoma cells. The growth-promoting activity of IL-6 was
also shown in vivo in mice coinjected with CHLA-255/Luc and
CHLA-255/IL-6 cells. Whether IL-6 could inhibit endothelial cell
proliferation and angiogenesis was, however, not explored. We
also show that PD98059, which inhibits Erk1/2, but not STAT-3,
activation, prevents the growth stimulatory activity of IL-6.
This suggests that the growth stimulatory effect of IL-6 on
neuroblastoma cells is, at least in part, mediated through
the Erk1/2 pathway, as was previously reported in multiple
myeloma (20). However, because we also observed inhibition
of growth stimulation by AG490, which inhibited both Erk1/2
and STAT-3, we cannot rule out the possibility that STAT-3
provides an alternate pathway. In B cells and renal cell carcinoma,
IL-6 stimulates proliferation in a STAT-3–dependent manner
(33, 34). Our data indicate that in most cases, IL-6 has a paracrine
effect on neuroblastoma cells (i.e., its source is not the tumor
cells), but that in some cases, it can have an autocrine effect
(i.e., its source is also in the tumor cells) as shown in SK-N-RA
cells.
The protective effect of IL-6 on drug-induced apoptosis is
reported here for the first time in neuroblastoma. Several IL-6–
mediated signaling pathways have been implicated in chemoresistance (28, 35, 36). IL-6 induces survival by transcriptionally
up-regulating the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells (37). In multiple myeloma and colorectal cancer,
STAT-3 activation up-regulates the expression of survival
proteins like survivin, cyclin D1, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 (38). The
protective activity of IL-6 on drug-induced apoptosis may also
involve regulation in the expression of multidrug resistance
transporters (39). The mechanism by which IL-6 protects
neuroblastoma cells from drug-induced apoptosis is not known
at this point, but is currently being actively investigated in our
laboratory.
Supporting a role for stromal-derived IL-6 in patients with
neuroblastoma bone metastasis, we showed in bone marrow
biopsies that IL-6 is expressed by cells in the bone marrow stroma
and not by tumor cells. We also show that BMSC isolated and
