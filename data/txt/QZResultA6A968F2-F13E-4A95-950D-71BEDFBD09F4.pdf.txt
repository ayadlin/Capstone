ABSTRACT
miR-143 and miR-145 are downregulated in colon cancer. Here, we tested
the effect of restoring these miRNAs on sensitization to cetuximab in mutant
KRAS (HCT116 and SW480) and wild-type KRAS (SW48) colon cancer cells. We
evaluated cetuximab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
the modulation of signaling pathways involved in immune effector cell-mediated
elimination of cancer cells. Stable miR-143 or miR-145 overexpression increased
cell sensitivity to cetuximab, resulting in a significant increase of cetuximab-mediated
ADCC independently of KRAS status. Importantly, HCT116 cells overexpressing these
miRNAs triggered apoptosis in result of cetuximab-mediated ADCC, effected by
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p < 0.01). This was associated with increased
apoptosis and caspase-3/7 activity, and reduced Bcl-2 protein expression (p < 0.01).
In addition, caspase inhibition abrogated cetuximab-mediated ADCC in HCT116 cells
overexpressing either miR-143 or miR-145 (p < 0.01). Furthermore, Bcl-2 silencing
led to high level of cetuximab-mediated ADCC, compared to control siRNA (p < 0.05).
Importantly, granzyme B inhibition, abrogated cetuximab-mediated ADCC,
reducing caspase-3/7 activity (p < 0.01). Collectively, our data suggests that
re-introduction of miR-143 or miR-145 may provide a new approach for development
of therapeutic strategies to re-sensitize colon cancer cells to cetuximab by stimulating
cetuximab-dependent ADCC to induce cell death.

INTRODUCTION

EGFR signaling by impairing receptor dimerization,
promoting receptor internalization and degradation,
and by activating antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) [3, 4]. Despite therapeutic
advances, the high rates of intrinsic and/or acquired
drug resistance severely narrow clinical options for
naïve and refractory patients, highlighting the need
for novel, more effective therapeutic strategies.
Although the targeting of EGFR pathways has been
quite successful, mutations in KRAS carry a negative
response predictive value of 99%, making it an ideal
predictive biomarker for EGFR targeted therapy [5].
This dramatically reduces the therapeutic options for
advanced colorectal cancer harboring KRAS mutations.
The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs)
provides a new hope for improving disease outcome
and has gained increasing relevance as putative cancer

Colon cancer is among the most frequent
malignant diseases in Western industrialized countries,
and one of the most common cancer types. Colon cancer
is also highly ranked in incidence and cancer-related
deaths worldwide [1], being the third most common
cancer in men (746,000 cases, 10% of the total),
second in women (614,000 cases, 9.2% of the total),
and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths
in the world, accounting for 8.5% of cancer-related
mortality [2]. Over the last ten years, the introduction
of targeted agents in clinical practice has led to
improvements in treatment of metastatic colon cancer.
Among these, cetuximab is a partially humanized
monoclonal antibody, raised against the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), which abrogates

therapeutics [6]. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs,
which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression
[7]. miRNAs undergo several bioprocessing steps until
the mature miRNA, a 15–22 nt single-strand RNA,
enters the cytoplasmatic multiprotein complex termed
miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Mature
miRNAs loaded onto miRISC are then able to bind to the
3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of target mRNAs carrying
complementary sequences, thereby repressing gene
expression [8]. Imperfect base pairing between miRNAs
and mRNAs is a common event, and enables individual
miRNAs to target a large, yet incompletely identified, set
of genes. Consequently, the ability of a single miRNA to
control several players of oncogenic signaling pathways
deregulated in cancer may hold the key to therapeutic
success [9–11].
Aberrant miRNA expression is widely reported in
cancer [12, 13], including colon cancer [14–16], providing
relevant insights into cancer tumorigenesis, diagnosis,
prognosis, and therapy response [9]. Furthermore, miRNA
modulation induces potent anticancer effects and sensitizes
to anticancer drugs [17–21], displaying enormous cancer
therapeutic potential. Importantly, in experimental cancer
models, the delivery of anti-tumorigenic miRNAs,
including miR-143 and miR-145, appears to be beneficial
for cancer therapy [21, 22].
miR-143 and miR-145 are tumor suppressor
miRNAs reported downregulated in several cancer types,
including in colon cancer adenomas and carcinomas
[17–19, 23]. These miRNAs are involved in the
regulation of several cellular processes including
proliferation, migration and chemoresistance [19,
24–26]. We have shown that miR-143 overexpression
induces tumor cell sensitization to 5-fluorouracil
[18]. In addition, miR-143 is also chemosensitizer to
docetaxel in prostate cancer by targeting KRAS and
subsequently targeting EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway
[27], while miR-145 inhibits EGFR mutant lung
cancer cell growth, sensitizing to gifitinib [25]. Further,
combined overexpression of miR-143 and miR-145
decreases squamous carcinoma proliferation while
sensitizing to cisplatin, and also sensitizes colon cancer
cells to 5-FU, irinotecan and oxaliplatin treatment [23].
The role of these miRNAs in EGFR signaling regulation
and cetuximab outcome in colon cancer is beginning to
emerge, but remains poorly explored. It was reported
that EGFR signaling pathway suppressed miR-143/145
in colonic cells, while overexpression of these miRNAs
suppressed EGFR-induced colon cancer cell growth [28].
Further, miR-143 down-regulation was correlated with
poor prognosis in wild-type KRAS patients, but low
levels of this miRNA did not display predictive value for
response to EGFR-targeted agents [29].
In the current study, we evaluated the role of
miR-143 or miR-145 in the modulation of response to
cetuximab in colon cancer cells derived from human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

primary colon carcinomas (HCT116, SW480 and SW48)
[30, 31], widely used for the study of cancer biology and
cellular response to drugs, including ADCC [32, 33]. Our
results showed that miR-143 or miR-145 overexpression
increased the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to cetuximab
by enhancing cetuximab-mediated ADCC and apoptosis.
Therefore, we propose that restoration of these miRNAs
contributes to cetuximab sensitization both in KRAS
mutant cetuximab-resistant and in KRAS wild-type colon
cancer cells.

RESULTS
miR-143 or miR-145 overexpression sensitizes
colon cancer cells to cetuximab
To gain insight into the biological effect of miR-143
or miR-145 in colon cancer cell response to cetuximab,
HCT116 cells were transduced with retroviral particles
containing MSCV-Neo constructs expressing miR-143
or miR-145, respectively, resulting in HCT116
overexpressing miR-143 (HCT116-miR-143) and miR-145
(HCT116-miR-145), and the respective Empty vector
control cell line (HCT116-Empty). The overexpression
of these miRNAs was confirmed by Northern blot
(Figure 1A). Next, we evaluated the effect of miR-143 or
miR-145 overexpression in HCT116 cell proliferation in
real-time, using the xCELLigence system. We observed
a significant increase in cell doubling time in HCT116miR-145 cell line compared with Empty control
cells, suggesting that miR-145 impaired HCT116 cell
proliferation (p < 0.01) (Figure 1B). In contrast, miR-143
overexpression did not alter cell doubling time. In
addition, cell migration was significantly decreased in
miR-143 or miR-145 transduced cells as compared to
Empty control cells. In this regard, HCT116-miR-143 and
HCT116-miR-145 cells displayed a 40 and 50%, reduction
in transwell migration through 8 µM polycarbonate
membrane filter, respectively, compared to HCT116-Empty
cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 1C). In addition, wound healing
assays confirmed these effects, since HCT116-miR-143
cells displayed a 30 and 40% reduced migration,
respectively at 48 and 72 h, compared to HCT116-Empty
control cells (p < 0.01); HCT116-miR-145 cells displayed
nearly 20% reduced cell migration at 72 h compared to
HCT116-Empty control cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 1D).
We next investigated whether miR-143 or miR-145
overexpression could alter the sensitivity of HCT116 cells
to cetuximab therapy. For this purpose, miR sensitization
effects were assessed by calculating IC50 values for
cetuximab using the xCELLigence system. Cetuximab
showed a higher growth-inhibitory effect on cells
overexpressing miR-143 or miR-145, with IC50 values of
832,22 and 668,42 μg/ml, respectively, compared to Empty
control cells which displayed an IC50 of 1719,66 μg/ml
(Table 1). These data clearly show that miR-143 or

72 h IC50 values were calculated for cetuximab
miR-145 overexpression in HCT116 cells led to a
reduction of the IC50 value of cetuximab of nearly 40%
(p < 0.01) (Figure 2A), indicating that these miRNAs
may be involved in HCT116 cell response to cetuximab.
To further explore these effects, we next exposed our
stable miR overexpressing cell model to 0-1600 μg/ml
cetuximab for 72 h, and evaluated the effect of stable
miR-143 or miR-145 in cell viability by MTS metabolism
assay. Our results indicate that overexpression of miR-143
or miR-145 significantly sensitized HCT116 cells
to cetuximab (Figure 2B). miR-143 overexpression
significantly decreased cell viability for cetuximab
concentrations higher than 1200 μg/ml (p < 0.01), while
miR-145 overexpression had a similar sensitization effect
for cetuximab concentrations higher than 600 μg/ml
(p < 0.05), both compared to Empty control cells (Figure 2B).
We further ascertained if the role of miR-143 or
miR-145 on increasing cetuximab sensitivity also occurs
in KRAS wild-type SW48 colon cancer cells, which are
sensitive to cetuximab. For this purpose, SW48 cells
were stably transduced with the same retroviral particles
used to generate HCT116 stable miRNAs overexpressing
cells, resulting in cells overexpressing miR-143 (SW48miR-143) and miR-145 (SW48-miR-145), and the
respective Empty vector control cell line (SW48-Empty).
miRNA expression was confirmed by Northern blot
(Figure S1A). Next, SW48-derived cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of cetuximab for 72 h, and cell
viability was evaluated by MTS assay. Exposure of SW48Empty cells to cetuximab resulted in an inhibition of cell
viability within the entire range of concentrations tested.
Importantly, overexpression of miR-143 and miR-145
significantly reduced cell viability of cells exposed to
cetuximab concentrations higher than 1 μg/ml (p < 0.01)
(Figure S1B). The results obtained suggest that miR-143
or miR-145 overexpression modulates cetuximab cell
sensitivity independently of KRAS mutation status.

triggering their cytolytic activity mediated by perforins and
granzymes, or by the Fas ligand (FasL) and tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [34–36].
Importantly, it is suggested that ADCC is a major in vivo
action mechanism of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) [37], implying that cetuximab-induced ADCC may
be an important mechanism of action of this mAb.
To evaluate the role of miR-143 or miR-145 in
cetuximab-mediated ADCC, we used our cell model
HCT116-miR-143, HCT116-miR-145 and HCT116Empty cell lines (target cells) and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from human healthy
donors (effector cells). Tumor cell death by cetuximabmediated ADCC was evaluated in real-time using the
xCELLigence system. As expected, an increase in cell
index as a function of time in culture was seen for all
HCT116-derived cells growing in media alone for 96 h
(Figure 3A). Further, treatment of HCT116 cells with 100
or 250 μg/ml cetuximab almost did not change the cell
index values compared to untreated cells up to 72 h of
exposure, regardless of miR-overexpression. In contrast,
cetuximab at 1600 μg/ml led to a significant reduction in
cell index values, to a higher extent in HCT116-miR-143,
HCT116-miR-145 compared to HCT116-Empty, leading
to a lower area under the growth curve (AUC) (Figure 3A).
Evaluation of ADCC was next performed using
100 μg/ml cetuximab and two different effector (E) to
target (T) cell ratio (E:T), 10:1 and 20:1, which alone
did not induce high levels of cell killing (Figure 3B).
Importantly, 100 μg/ml cetuximab concentration,
which we previously found ineffective in reducing
HCT116 cell viability (Figure 2), when combined with
effector cells, significantly decreased cell index values,
resulting in higher growth-inhibitory effects on miRNA
overexpressing cell lines, HCT116-miR-143 and HCT116miR-145, compared to HCT116-Empty vector cells
(Figure 3C). These effects were visible at an E:T ratio
of 10:1, but were more pronounced at E:T ratio of 20:1,
hence this latter ratio was chosen for further experiments.
As a quantitative indicator of target cell killing activity
mediated by effector cells in the presence of cetuximab,
we determined the AUC for 72 h of treatment, and
calculated the percentage cell killing (Cell kill (%)),
using the formula described in materials and methods
section. Cell kill determined for target cells exposed to
100 μg/ml cetuximab alone, was less than 10% for all cell
lines, while exposure to effector cells at 20:1 E:T ratio
increased cell kill to ~ 20% in all cell lines, regardless

In addition to blocking EGFR signaling pathway,
cetuximab also promotes cell death through ADCC [3].
Regarding ADCC-mediated effect, the constant fragment

of miRNA expression levels. Importantly, exposure to
100 μg/ml cetuximab and effector cells at 20:1 E:T,
resulted in higher growth-inhibitory effects in HCT116miR-143 and HCT116-miR-145, ~ 65% cell kill, compared
to 42% cell kill in HCT116-Empty cells (p < 0.01).
Rituximab was used as a control antibody, and its addition
alone or together with effector cells at 20:1 E:T, did not
significantly increase cell kill, indicating that ADCC is a
mechanism of cell death induction for cetuximab, and that
miR-143 and miR-145 are modulators of this mechanism
of antibody-mediated cell death (p < 0.01) (Figure 3D).
In addition, under the same conditions, cetuximab
treatment combined with effector cells significantly
increased death of cells overexpressing miR-143 or
miR-145 compared to Empty-vector control (p < 0.001),
evaluated by LDH release assay. Similarly to xCELLigence
assays, control antibody rituximab alone or together with
effector cells did not significantly increase cytotoxicity
in HCT116-miR-143 and HCT116-miR-145 (p < 0.01)
(Figure 3E).
We next ascertained if miR-143 or miR-145
increased cetuximab-mediated ADCC also occurred
in other colon cancer cell lines, including cetuximabsensitive cells. For this purpose, SW48-derived cells
(Figure S1A) were exposed to cetuximab and effector
cells, and cetuximab-mediated ADCC was evaluated by
xCELLigence and LDH release assays. As expected, our
results demonstrated that SW48-derived cells treated
with lower concentrations of cetuximab, 1 and 10 μg/ml,
display reduced cell index values compared to untreated

cells, with this reduction being more pronounced in
SW48-miR-143 and SW48-miR-145, compared to
SW48-Empty cells (Figure S2A). Moreover, the addition
of cetuximab and effector cells at 6:1 E:T ratio, which
alone did not alter the cell index (Figure S2B), resulted in a
significant decrease in cell index values for 1 and 10 μg/ml
cetuximab (Figure S2C). Importantly, higher growthinhibitory effects were observed on SW48-miR-143
and SW48-miR-145, ~ 40% cell kill, compared to 29%
cell kill in SW48-Empty cells (p < 0.01) (Figure S2D).
Corroborating these results, LDH release was significantly
increased in cells overexpressing miR-143 or miR-145
treated with cetuximab combined with effector cells,
compared to Empty-vector control (p < 0.05) (Figure S2E).
Confirming the specificity of cetuximab-mediated ADCC,
no significant increase in cell kill and cytotoxicity was
detected in SW48-derived cells following exposure to
rituximab and effector cells.
We additionally validated the results obtained for
KRAS mutant HCT116 cells in another KRAS mutant,
cetuximab-resistant cell line, SW480. For this purpose,
SW480 cells were stably traduced with retroviruses
overexpressing miR-143 or miR-145, and the control
Empty vector, similarly to HCT116 and SW48 cell
models, in order to generate SW480 cells overexpressing
miR-143 (SW480-miR-143), and miR-145 (SW480miR-145), and the respective Empty-vector control
(SW480-Empty). Northern blot was performed to confirm
miRNA expression levels (Figure S3A). Next, to evaluate
cetuximab-mediated ADCC, cells were treated with

Figure 2: miR-143 or miR-145 overexpression sensitizes HCT116 mutant KRAS colon cancer cells to cetuximab.
HCT116-Empty, HCT116-miR-143 and HCT116-miR-145 stably transduced cells were plated onto a 96-well E-Plate of xCELLigence
System. 24 h after plating cells were exposed to 0-1600 μg/ml cetuximab, and allowed to growth for 72 h. (A) Cell index was measured
every 5 min, which allowed IC50 determination from the time of incubation. (B) Cell viability was also evaluated by MTS metabolism assay.
The results are expressed as (A) the mean ± SEM fold change to control cells, or (B) the mean ± SEM fold change to respective untreated
cells, from at least three independent experiments. **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05 from HCT116-Empty cells.

Apoptosis is increased in miR-143 or miR-145
overexpressing cells during cetuximab-mediated
ADCC

100 μg/ml cetuximab, and/or with PBMCs, as effector
cells. The results obtained demonstrated that treatment of
these cetuximab-resistant cells with 100 μg/ml cetuximab
did not induce changes in the cell index values compared to
untreated cells (Figure S3B). Similarly to HCT116-derived
cells, exposure of SW480-derived cells to PBMCs at a
20:1 E:T ratio did not induce high levels of cell killing
(Figure S3C), while exposure to 100 μg/ml cetuximab and
PBMCs, significantly decreased cell index values (Figure
S3D), resulting in higher growth-inhibitory effects in
SW480-miR-143 and SW480-miR-145 cells, ~ 50% cell
kill, compared to 28% cell kill in SW480-Empty cells
(p < 0.05). Treatment of SW480-derived cells with the
control antibody rituximab, and PBMCs increased cell kill
to an extent similar to that elicited by PBMCs (Figure S3E).
In this context, miR-143 or miR-145 overexpression
significantly increased cell death of SW480 cells
exposed to cetuximab together with effector cells,
and again, exposure to control antibody rituximab,
and effector cells only increased cell cytotoxicity to a
similar extent of that elicited by PBMCs (Figure S3F).
Therefore, taken together, these results unveil the
importance of miR-143 and miR-145 in modulating
ADCC as a mechanism of cell death induced by
cetuximab in presence of PBMCs.
In addition, we were also interested in evaluating
if the role of miR-143 or miR-145 on increasing
ADCC in colon cancer cells was cetuximab-specific.
Therefore, we evaluated the effect of these miRNAs
in modulating the sensitivity to another targeted agent
that also induces ADCC. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal
antibody used in the treatment of metastatic breast
cancer, which targets HER2 receptor, leading to
the inhibition of its downstream signaling pathway.
Among the proposed mechanism of action of this
agent, ADCC is suggested as a major mechanism
of trastuzumab-mediated tumor cell death [37, 38].
Further, HCT116 cells have previously been reported to
express HER2 receptor [39] and trastuzumab-mediated
HER-2 inhibition failed to block HCT116 cell proliferation
[40]. Therefore, HCT116-derived cells were exposed
to trastuzumab and effector cells, and target cell death
was evaluated. As expected, exposure to trastuzumab
alone did not induce cell kill. However the addition of
trastuzumab and effector cells significantly increased death
of cells overexpressing miR-143 and miR-145, observed
in both xCELLigence and LDH released assays (p < 0.01).
Importantly, trastuzumab-mediated cytotoxicity observed
was significantly higher compared to the cytotoxicity
induced by the control antibody rituximab (p < 0.05),
confirming the specificity of trastuzumab-mediated
ADCC, and expanding to role of miR-143 and miR-145 in
sensitization to ADCC, suggesting that this cellular effect
may be in play independently of the therapeutic antibody
used to elicit ADCC, further highlighting the relevance of
these miRNAs as promising therapeutic agents (Figure S4).

To investigate whether apoptosis was induced
during cetuximab-mediated ADCC, we performed
nuclear morphology evaluation studies by fluorescent
microscopy following Hoechst staining. Our results
show that overexpression of miR-143 or miR-145
enhanced cetuximab-mediated ADCC-induced apoptosis,
resulting in 23% increase in nuclear fragmentation
and nuclear morphological changes characteristic of
apoptosis, as compared to Empty control cells (p < 0.001)
(Figure 4A). Confirming these observations, flow
cytometry analysis of 7-AAD and Annexin-V
staining indicated that treatment with cetuximab and
PBMCs led to a significant increase in apoptotic cells
of 32 and 42%, respectively in HCT116-miR-143
and HCT116-miR-145 compared to HCT116-Empty
cells (p < 0.001) (Figure 4B). No significant increase in
apoptosis was observed between cell lines treated with
rituximab and PBMCs (Figure 4A and 4B). Apoptosis
induction by cetuximab and PBMCs was further confirmed
by caspase-3/7 activity assays, which indicated that
exposure to cetuximab and PBMCs induced a significant
increase in caspase-3/7 activity of 37 and 31%, respectively
in HCT116-miR-143 and HCT116-miR-145, compared
to HCT116-Empty control cells (p < 0.001 for HCTmiR-143 and p < 0.01 for HCT116-miR-145) (Figure 4C).
Importantly, and confirming the specificity of cetuximabmediated ADCC, no significant increase in caspase-3/7
activity was detected in our HCT116 cell model following
exposure to rituximab and PBMCs (Figure 4C). In
addition, the cleavage of the endogenous substrate of
active caspase-3, PARP, was substantially increased up
to ~ 4- and 6-fold, respectively in HCT116-miR-143
and HCT116-miR-145, compared to HCT116-Empty
control cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 4D), further confirming that
miR-143 and miR-145 overexpression increased apoptosis
induced by cetuximab-mediated ADCC in HCT116 cells.
Similarly, no significant increase in PARP cleavage was
observed in HCT116-miR-143 and HCT116-miR-145
cells treated control antibody rituximab together with
PBMCs (Figure 4D).
We next evaluated the involvement of caspase
activation on cetuximab-mediated ADCC. For this
purpose, we treated HCT116-derived cells with the
pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, before exposure to
cetuximab and PBMCs, and confirmed a reduction in
apoptosis (Figure 4B) and caspase-3/7 activity (Figure 4C).
Importantly, caspase inhibition following exposure to
cetuximab and effector cells, resulted in a significant cell
kill reduction of 65 and 57%, respectively in HCT116miR-143 and HCT116-miR-145, compared to the
17% reduction in HCT116-Empty cell line (p < 0.001)

the 23% reduction observed in HCT116-Empty cells

or miR-145 overexpression triggered cetuximab-mediated
ADCC inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis.

respectively for 100 μg/ml and 250 μg/ml cetuximab
(p < 0.01), compared with control siRNA transfected cells,
which displayed only 30% cell kill upon exposure to 100 or
250 μg/ml cetuximab (Figure 5C).

Granzyme B activity is involved in miR-143 or
miR-145-increased cetuximab-mediated ADCC
To further identify the mechanism underlying
cetuximab-mediated ADCC in our cell model, we
evaluated the signaling pathways mediating these effects.
Effector cells mainly induce apoptosis in target cells by
two mechanisms: death receptor-mediated (Fas-L- and
TRAIL-mediated); and perforin/granzyme-mediated. Both
pathways can directly activate caspase cascades, leading
to target cell apoptosis. Therefore, we tested our HCT116
cell model for sensitivity to apoptosis triggered by Fasor granzyme B-activated signaling pathways. In order to
evaluate the involvement of Fas death-receptor signaling
pathway in this context, we inhibited Fas receptor in target
cells using a Fas neutralizing antibody. Our results showed
that Fas blocking did not alter cetuximab-mediated ADCC
(Figure 6A). Importantly, inhibition of granzyme B in
PBMCs almost completely abrogated miR-143 or miR-145
increase in cetuximab-mediated ADCC in HCT116 cells
(p < 0.001) (Figure 6B). Interestingly, this inhibition also
occurred in empty control cells (p < 0.05). Therefore,
our data clearly shows that granzyme B plays a key role
in effecting cell death induced by cetuximab-mediated
ADCC effected by PBMCs in HCT116 cells.
Activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis has been
reported to be a hallmark of both Fas- and granzyme
B-mediated cytotoxicity. Considering the lack of
involvement of Fas in mediating cell death effected
by PBMCs following cetuximab treatment, we next
evaluated if caspase-dependent apoptosis resulting from
cetuximab-mediated ADCC was dependent on granzyme
B activity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed our
HCT116 cell model to cetuximab and PBMCs previously
incubated with granzyme B inhibitor, Ac-IETD-CHO, and
evaluated caspase-3/7 activity. Our data confirmed that
caspase-3/7 activity was almost completely abrogated,
clearly confirming the involvement of granzyme B in
the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by
cetuximab-mediated ADCC. (Figure 6C).

Bcl-2 knock-down is involved in miR-143 or
miR-145-increased cetuximab-mediated ADCC
In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of
miR-143 or miR-145 activity in colon cancer and cetuximab
sensitization, we examined the expression levels of Bcl-2,
which was shown to be reduced following miR-143
overexpression [18, 19], and may be relevant in this
cetuximab-sensitization context, due to role in apoptosis
regulation.
Interestingly, we found that miR-143 overexpression
significantly decreased Bcl-2 protein steady-state expression.
Our data demonstrated a 40% decrease in Bcl-2 steady-state
levels in HCT116-miR-143 cells, compared to HCT116Empty cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 5A, lane 2 versus 1). Further,
following cetuximab exposure, Bcl-2 reduction in HCT116miR-143 cells was even more pronounced, leading to an
approximate 60% reduction as compared to HCT116-Empty
cells (Figure 5A, lane 5 versus 4) (p < 0.01). In contrast,
Bcl-2 steady-state expression levels in HCT116-miR-145
cells only slightly decreased following cetuximab treatment,
which may be attributable to the fact that Bcl-2 is a miR143 direct target [41]. Curiously, following exposure to
cetuximab and/or PBMCs, Bcl-2 protein steady-state levels
significantly increased in control cells. Interestingly, this
effect was abrogated in cells overexpressing miR-143 or
miR-145, in which Bcl-2 levels were reduced in almost 50%
compared to empty control cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 5A, lanes
11 and 12 versus 10).
To explore whether increased sensitivity to cetuximabmediated ADCC in HCT116 cells is regulated by Bcl-2
protein levels, Bcl-2 expression was efficiently knockeddown in HCT116 cells by transfecting a specific Bcl-2
siRNA (and a non-targeting control siRNA) (Figure 5B,
upper panel). Subsequently, cells with Bcl-2 (and control)
silencing were exposed to cetuximab and/or PBMCs.
Our results from cytotoxicity assays showed that Bcl2 silencing slightly reduced HCT116 cell viability and
increased general cell death following cetuximab exposure
at 250 μg/ml and 1600 μg/ml (p < 0.01) (Figure 5B,
lower panel), compared with siRNA control transfected
cells. No significant effect on cell death was observed
following 100 μg/ml cetuximab treatment. Importantly,
Bcl-2 silencing induced over 2-fold increase in cetuximabmediated ADCC in the presence of PBMCs compared

DISCUSSION
The heterogeneity of colon cancer contributes to
several mechanisms of therapy resistance. Despite the fact
that EGFR-targeted therapies, such as cetuximab, have
been approved for clinical use only a small percentage
of patients benefit from these therapeutic agents [42].
Therefore, identification of novel approaches to tackle
cetuximab resistance would be key to sensitize cells to this

therapy. Importantly, miRNAs have emerged as a great
promise to make tumors responsive to chemotherapeutics,
since miRNAs are able to target multiple proteins involved
in different signaling pathways that are often compromised
in cancer [10].
In this study, we observed that miR-143 or miR-145
overexpression reduced cell proliferation and migration of
mutant KRAS HCT116 colon cancer cells, and sensitized
both mutant KRAS (HCT116 and SW480), as well as
wild-type KRAS (SW48) cells to cetuximab. miR-143
and miR-145 are co-transcribed miRNAs that have been
widely studied as potential tumor suppressors. They were
first reported as downregulated in colon cancer [43], and
subsequently also in other solid tumors of epithelial origin
[44–46]. Additionally, several functional studies have
demonstrated that enforced ectopic expression of these
miRNAs reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and/
or suppressed tumor-forming ability of diverse cancer
cell types in vitro and in vivo [17–19, 47]. In addition,
it was reported that decreased miR-143 expression might
contribute to the pathogenesis of colon cancer by upregulating KRAS expression [48], and miR-143 downregulation correlates with poor prognosis in wild-type
KRAS patients [29]. Similarly, miR-145 is also implicated
in Ras/MAPK signaling pathway by targeting RREB1
protein, which negatively regulates the miR-143/145
promoter and potentiates signaling through Ras effector
pathway [49]. Considering that the presence of mutations
in KRAS gene renders tumor cells inherently resistant to
anti-EGFR therapy, our results indicate that miR-143 or
miR-145 may be key players in mitigating cetuximab
resistance in mutant KRAS colon cancer cells.
According to the literature, the direct inhibition
of cell growth mediated by cetuximab is limited,
and requires a relative high dose of antibody [3, 50].
However, this monoclonal antibody is able to eliminate
EGFR-expressing tumor cells via ADCC at much lower
concentrations [3, 51], suggesting ADCC as an important
antitumor mechanism of cetuximab. The interaction of
the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of cetuximab with
EGFR together with the interaction of the Fc portion of
cetuximab with FcγRs expressed by effector cells leads
to ADCC initiation. In result, immune cells eliminate
antibody-coated tumor cells [52]. The importance of
ADCC for the in vivo effect of monoclonal antibodies is
evident from previous studies showing loss of efficacy of
these agents in FcRγ−/−mice that are deficient in activating
Fc receptors [37]. In addition, FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa gene
polymorphisms have been involved in increased ADCCrelated therapeutic response to cetuximab in early-stage
[53] and metastatic colon cancer patients [54, 55].
In this study, we demonstrated that miR-143 or miR145 overexpression increased the growth inhibitory effect
of cetuximab in cetuximab-resistant HCT116 colon cancer
cells, upon exposure to high doses of cetuximab (Figure 2).
On the other hand, the combination of cetuximab
and effector cells resulted in a significant increase of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cytotoxicity in cetuximab-resistant (HCT116 and SW480)
and -sensitive (SW48) colon cancer cells overexpressing
miR-143 or miR-145, at clinically achievable cetuximab
doses (Figure 3, S2 and S3). This suggests that these
miRNAs potentiate the antitumor effects of cetuximab,
which are likely based on the engagement of immune
effector mechanisms, in particular ADCC, independently of
KRAS mutation status. Considering that under the current
clinical dosing regimen, cetuximab average steady state
plasma concentration is estimated to be around 100 μg/ml
[56, 57], our results indicate that the contribution of
these miRNAs to cetuximab sensitivity in mutant KRAS
HCT116 and SW480, and wild-type SW48 colon cancer
cell lines could be relevant for future clinical studies
in advancing the understanding of miRNA modulation
as putative therapeutic approaches in colon cancer.
Interestingly, we found that miR-143 or miR-145 are also
able to increase trastuzumab-mediated ADCC (Figure S4),
expanding the therapeutic relevance of these miRNAs
and demonstrating that their effect is not restricted to
cetuximab-mediated ADCC.
Activation of immune cells, such as natural killer
(NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes and monocytes,
through FcγR results in target cell killing via ADCC,
which leads to tumor cell apoptosis [58, 59]. Our results
suggest that HCT116-miR-143 and HCT116-miR-145
cells are more sensitive to apoptosis elicited by cetuximabmediated ADCC, displaying increased caspase-3/7
activity, as compared to control cells (Figure 4).
Importantly, caspase inhibition abrogated cell killing
induced by effector cells and cetuximab in HCT116
cells overexpressing miR-143 or miR-145 (Figure 4),
confirming the involvement of caspases in cetuximabmediated ADCC. This increased apoptosis could be
explained in part by the reduced Bcl-2 levels in miR-143
and miR-145 overexpressing cells compared to
empty control cells following cetuximab and PBMCs
exposure, increasing the susceptibility of cells to effector
cell-mediated apoptosis. This is in agreement with our
previous results, which demonstrated that miR-143
overexpression reduces Bcl-2 expression in vitro [18], and
reduces colon cancer tumor xenograft growth displaying
higher levels of tumor cell apoptosis with decreased
steady-state levels of Bcl-2 [19]. Importantly, Bcl-2 and
other anti-apoptotic proteins reported overexpressed
in several cancers are associated with the development
of resistance to anticancer agents [60, 61], highlighting
the therapeutic potential of targeting Bcl-2 in cancer
treatment.
Cytotoxic effector cells kill their target cells through
the death receptor pathway (Fas/FasL or TRAILR/TRAIL)
and/or the granule secretory pathway. In the first case, the
engagement of death receptors by their cognate ligands
results in activation of caspase proteolytic cascade
[62]. In the second case, granzymes, such as granzyme
B, are released in the intercellular space between target
and effector cells, and enter the target cell via perforin9379

Oncotarget

dependent or -independent manner. Once inside the target
cell, granzyme B can induce apoptosis by targeting both
cytosolic and nuclear substrates. The most well-known
function of granzyme B is the direct cleavage of caspase-3
and/or Bid. Bid cleavage produces truncated Bid, which
triggers the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane,
resulting in caspase activation and release of proapoptotic
proteins [63]. To better understand the involvement of
both cytotoxic mechanisms in cetuximab-mediated ADCC
triggered by PBMCs in HCT116 cells, we blocked Fas/
FasL pathway and granzyme B-mediated, and evaluated
their effect in cell killing. Inhibition of Fas did not alter
the cytotoxicity induced by effector cells and cetuximab
in our cell model (Figure 6). However, in marked contrast,
granzyme B inhibition almost completely abrogated cell
death as well as caspase-3/7 activity induced by effector
cells in presence of cetuximab. This suggests that the
granule secretory pathway is involved in the cytotoxicity
resulting from cetuximab-mediated ADCC (Figure 6).
Granzyme B-induced mitochondrial cell death was
reported to be inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression [64, 65],
which blocks the release of proapoptotic proteins that
suppress caspase inhibition, leading to a decreased
sensitivity of target cells to immune cell-mediated
cell death [66]. Indeed, reduced levels of Bcl-2 in our
HCT116-miR-143 and HCT116-miR-145 overexpressing
cells following treatment with effector cells and cetuximab
(Figure 5), could promote the release of proapoptotic
proteins, such as Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 [66], thus
contributing to granzyme B-induced apoptotic pathway by
relieving caspase inhibition. Although the inhibition of
granzyme B abrogated the cytotoxicity of effector cells
and cetuximab regardless of miRNA expression levels, the
extent of caspase and nuclear fragmentation inhibition was
higher in cells overexpressing miR-143 or miR-145, which
also display reduced Bcl-2 protein steady-state levels.
Therefore, our data suggests that caspase activation in
response to cetuximab and PBMCs proceeds through
a granzyme B-dependent pathway, regulated by Bcl-2.
Nevertheless, additional studies should be performed to
deeply understand the involvement of these proteins in
miR-143 or miR-145-mediated cetuximab sensitivity.
miRNAs function as genome master regulators,
showing broad activity in several cancer types, and are
able to sensitize tumor cells to therapy. This supports the
evidence that miRNAs are promising candidates for the
development of new approaches that could circumvent the
resistance to chemotherapy and targeted agents, and could
ultimately translate into improved care for colon cancer
patients. Collectively, our data indicates that restoration
of miR-143 or miR-145 reduces the aggressiveness
of mutant KRAS HCT116 cells. In addition, forced
expression of these miRNAs in both mutant and wildtype KRAS colon cancer cells increased their sensitivity
to cetuximab by increasing cetuximab-mediated ADCC.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Moreover, increased levels of effector cell-mediated
caspase-dependent apoptosis were observed for mutant
KRAS HCT116 miRNAs-overexpressing cells. Therefore,
miR-143 and miR-145 modulation may constitute
relevant candidates for future therapeutic interventions in
combination with cetuximab treatment, and possibly also
with other therapeutic antibodies with ADCC-inducing
capability.

MSCV-Neo retroviral expression constructs
expressing miR-143 or miR-145 were kindly provided by
Dr. Joshua Mendell, (Howard Hughes Medical Institute
(HHMI), Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA)
[47]. Retroviral particles were package by transfecting
Phi-Nx AMPHO cells with MSCV-Neo vectors using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Massachusetts, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Retrovirus-containing supernatants were
collected 48 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.22
μm filter, and stored at −80ºC until use.

Generation of stable miRNA overexpressing cells
To generate miR-143 or miR-145 stable

were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well, and
24 h later, transduced with retroviral particles carrying
MSCV-Neo constructs overexpressing miR-143, miR145 or empty vector. Forty-eight hours after transduction,
HCT116 and SW480 or SW48 transduced cell populations
were selected with 1 mg/ml or 400 μg/ml neomycin (Gibco,

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
isolation and handling
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were isolated from healthy volunteers with Ficoll-Paque
Plus density gradient (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB,
Uppsala, Sweden) and used as effector cells, as described
in [69]. After isolation, PBMCs were resuspended in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (all from Gibco,
Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and left
overnight at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
PBMCs were then counted by trypan blue exclusion assay,
resuspended in cold freezing medium (FBS with 10%
DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and stored
as 4 × 106 cells/vial, at −80°C until use. When needed,
PBMCs were thawed, resuspended in culture medium, and
incubated for 18 h at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2.

Evaluation of miRNA expression by northern blot
Northern blot experiments were performed as
described in [67]. Briefly, 10 or 20 μg of total RNA
isolated from HCT116, SW480 and SW48 cells with
stable overexpression of miR-143 and miR-145 and
empty control cells were loaded onto a 15% SequaGel
(National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), electrophoresed,
and transferred to nylon membranes at 15 V for 60 min
using a Trans-Blot SD semidry transfer system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA). RNA was cross-linked
to membranes at 60°C for 2 h using freshly prepared
cross-linking reagent [68].
Locked nucleic acid
(LNA)-modified oligonucleotides specific for each
miRNA were then hybridized to membranes using
ULTRAhyb-Oligo buffer (Ambion, Life Technologies,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA)modified oligonucleotides specific for each miRNA
were purchased from Exiqon (Exiqon A/S, Vedbaek,
Denmark) and labeled with digoxigenin (DIG), using an
end tailing kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).
Sequences of the oligonucleotide probes were
GAGCTACAGTGCTTCATCTCA (miR-143)
and
AGGGATTCCTGGGAAAACTGGAC (miR-145). After
hybridization, membranes were washed with differentstringency buffer solutions and blocked in blocking buffer
(DIG Wash and Block buffer set; Roche Applied Science)
for 3 h at room temperature before incubation with an antiDIG antibody at room temperature for 1 h. For miRNA
detection, membranes were processed using a substrate
solution (CSPD; Roche Applied Science), after washing
in DIG washing buffer, visualized and acquired under
ChemiDoc MP System (Bio-Rad). The relative intensities
of RNA bands were detected using the Image Lab
densitometric analysis program (version 4.1; Bio-Rad). As
loading control, non-saturated images of ethidium bromide
stained gel were taken before transfer to the membrane.

Cell treatments
Cetuximab and Rituximab were kindly provided

and rituximab were freshly prepared in phosphate
buffer saline (PBS). Twenty-four hours after plating,
HCT116, SW480 and SW48 cells were incubated
with either cetuximab or PBS (vehicle control), at
the indicated concentrations and exposure times. For
ADCC experiments HCT116, SW480 and SW48 cells
(target cells) were incubated with cetuximab (1, 10, 100,
250 or 1600 μg/ml) or vehicle control, with medium with
PBMCs (effector cells) at the indicated effector (E) to
target (T) cell ratio (E:T), and cetuximab/rituximab with
PBMCs in a similar E:T ratio. To inhibit granzyme B,
PBMCs were pre-incubated with 100 μM of Granzyme
B inhibitor II, Ac-IETD-CHO (Calbiochem, Merck
Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) for 30 min at 37ºC,
before target cell treatment. For Fas neutralization,
HCT116 cells were pre-treated with 500 ng/ml of Fas
neutralizing antibody (ZB4) (Merck Millipore) for
2 h before the addition of cetuximab and/or PBMCs.
To inhibit apoptosis, target cells were pre-incubated
with 50 μM of Pan-Caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk
for 1 h before cetuximab and/or PBMCs exposure.

Microsystems AG, Heersbrugg, Switzerland) with the
IM50 software for image acquisition (Leica Microsystems,
version 1.20, Release 9). Number of migrated cells per
well was determined by counting the total cells per well
using Image J software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).

USA). General cell death was evaluated by the Lactate
Dehydrogenase Cytotoxicity Detection KitPLUS (Roche
Diagnostics Gmbh, Mannheim, Germany), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 50 μL of cell culture
supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate,
discarding the remainder cell culture supernatant. Cells
attached in the well were lysed by adding 50 μL of lysis
solution diluted in culture medium to obtain a cell lysate.
Subsequently, 50 μL of LDH reagent mix was added
to each well containing either cell culture supernatant
or cell lysate, followed by a 30 min incubation at room
temperature, protected from light. Absorbance was read
at 490 nm, with 620 nm reference wavelengths using a
Model 680 microplate reader. The percentage of LDH
release was determined as the ratio between released LDH
(supernatant) and the total LDH (supernatant + cell lysate),
in the same well, as previously described [71].

Real-Time monitoring of cell proliferation and
viability
Dynamic proliferation and viability were monitored
with xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA) SP
System (ACEA Biosciences Inc, CA, USA) and E-plates
(96-well). The xCELLigence System monitors cellular
events in real-time without the incorporation of labels. The
system measures electrical impedance across interdigitated
microelectrodes integrated on the bottom of tissue culture
E-Plates. Impedance measurements allow monitorization
and detection of the biological status of cells, including
cell number and viability. Real-time data is provided as
cell index, representing the relative change in electrical
impedance that occurs in the wells [72], where increased
cell number attached to the bottom of the E-plate is
directly proportional to increased cell index value. For
proliferation and viability assessment, 5,000 cells were
seeded in each well, in 100 μl of culture medium. Twentyfour hours later, cells were incubated with cetuximab or
vehicle, by adding 100 μl of cetuximab in culture media,
or 100 μl of culture medium alone. Cetuximab final
concentrations ranged from 0 (vehicle) to 1600 μg/ml. Cell
index values were measured every 5 min, for 96 h. Cell
index values from 0 to 24 h (before cetuximab incubation)
were used to plot and calculate doubling times. Cell index
values of cells exposed to serial dilutions of cetuximab
for 72 h were used to calculate cetuximab IC50 values in
each cell line, using RTCA Software Package (ACEA
Biosciences Inc).

Wound healing assay
HCT116 cells with stable overexpression of miR-143
and miR-145 and empty control cells were seeded on 35
mm3 dishes at 3 × 106 cells/dish, and allowed to grow
to confluence. Next, “wounds” were performed using
a sterile 10 μl tip, followed by 2 washes with culture
medium. Cell migration to the “wound area” was
evaluated and images captured at 24, 48, and 72 h with
a Zeiss Primo Vert microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy
GmbH) connected to a Leica DFC 40 camera (Leica
Microsystems AG). The total empty “wound” area
(cell free) was measured using Image J software. “Wound”
closure was calculated by subtracting the wound area at
the indicated time periods from the initial wound area.

Cell death and viability assays
The differential cetuximab sensitivity of colon cancer
cells with stable overexpression of miR-143 or miR-145
and empty control cells, was evaluated through the
assessment of cell death and cell viability. For cytotoxicity
assays, HCT116 and SW48 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at 5,000 and 15,000 cells/well, respectively,
and exposed to serial dilutions of cetuximab for 72 h.
Cell viability was assayed using CellTiter 96 AQueous
Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. In brief, cell culture supernatants were
replaced by 100 μL of MTS/PMS solution prepared in
fresh culture media, and cells incubated at 37°C for 45 min.
Changes in absorbance were measured at 490 nm, using
a Model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity evaluation
Cetuximab- and trastuzumab-mediated ADCC
was assayed using xCELLigence. Aside from viability,
proliferation, and cell death, this system has been
successfully used to evaluate ADCC [73–75]. For
quantification of ADCC, PBMCs were used as effector

Oncotarget

cells (E). HCT116, SW480 and SW48 cells with stable
overexpression of miR-143 and miR-145, and empty
control cells, were used as target cells (T), HCT116 and
SW480 cells were plated onto a 96-well E-plate at 5,000
cells/well and SW48 cells were plated at 15,000 cells/
well, and allowed to attach and grow for 24 h. Cells were
then incubated in duplicate with cetuximab or effector
cells at E:T of 6:1, 10:1 and 20:1 alone, and also with
cetuximab or trastuzumab together with PBMCs, and
vehicle control. Cell Index was measured every 15 min up
to 72 h following cetuximab or trastuzumab and/or PBMC
exposure, and used to plot cell index curves. Raw cell
index curves were normalized to cell index value of 1.0 at
the time of treatment start. Cetuximab- and trastuzumabmediated ADCC quantitative effects were determined by
calculating area under the growth curves (AUC) during the
72 h of exposure to cetuximab or vehicle control together
with effector cell exposure (AUC(72)). The percent of cell
killing (Cell kill (%)) was calculated using the following
formula [76]:
AUC(72) (without cetuximab)
– AUC(72) (with cetuximab)
Cell kill (%) =
×100
AUC(72) (without cetuximab)

cetuximab or vehicle control, PBMCs (10:1), or 100
μg/ml cetuximab with PBMCs (10:1). After 24 h of
treatment, attached cells were washed with PBS to
remove effector cells, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 20 min, washed with PBS, and stained with
5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 15 min
at room temperature, protected from light. Subsequently,
coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted on glass
slides with Fluoromount-G (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea,
CA). Fluorescent nuclei were evaluated by fluorescence
microscopy using a Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 fluorescence
microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH), equipped
with an AxioCam HRm (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH).
At least five random microscopic field per sample of ~ 100
nuclei were counted for each condition. The results were
expressed as the percentage of apoptotic nuclei per field.
Apoptosis was quantified using the Guava Nexin
Reagent kit (Merck Millipore). The Nexin assay uses two
distinct dyes, Annexin V-PE to detect phosphatidylserine
(PS) on the external membrane of apoptotic cells, and
the cell impermeant dye, 7-AAD, as an indicator of
membrane structural integrity. For this purpose 2.5 × 104
HCT116-derived cells were plated on 24-well culture
plates, and treated as for Hoechst staining. After 48 h of
treatment, cell culture supernatant and adherent cells were
collected, centrifuged and resuspended in PBS containing
2% FBS for incubation with Guava Nexin Reagent.
Subsequently, 70 μl of cell suspension were mixed with
70 μl of Guava Nexin Reagent, incubated for 20 min at
room temperature, protected from light, and assayed
promptly, using a Guava easyCyte 5HT flow cytometer
(Merck Millipore). Sample acquisition and analysis were
performed using the InCyte software module (Merck
Millipore).

Cell lysis was also detected by measuring the
amount of LDH released into the culture supernatant at
48 h, using the LDH assay kit. Briefly, cells were seeded
at 5,000 or 15,000 cells/well for HCT116 and SW480 or
SW48, respectively, and treated in the same conditions
as described above. After 48 h of treatment, the plate
was briefly centrifuged at 700 g, 2 min, and LDH release
assay performed as described above. In brief, 50 μl of cell
culture supernatant was used to determine LDH release,
whereas maximum LDH release was evaluated following
target cell lysis, after extensive washes with PBS to
remove effector cells. Percent cytotoxicity was calculated
as follows:
Cytotoxicity (%)=

(experimental LDH release–
spontaneous LDH release)
(maximum LDH release –
spontaneous LDH release)

Caspase-3 and -7 activity assay
Caspase-3 and -7 activation status was measured
using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega). In this
assay, caspase-3 and -7 activity was measured evaluating
aminoluciferin-induced luminescence resulting from
DEVD-aminoluciferin substrate cleavage. For this
purpose, HCT116 cells stably expressing miR-143 or
miR-145 were seeded on 96-well plates at 5,000 cells/
well, and exposed to 100 μg/ml cetuximab or vehicle
control, PBMCs (20:1), or cetuximab with PBMCs (20:1).
After 16 h of treatment, 75 μL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent
was added to each well, plates were mixed by orbital
shaking for 30 s, and incubated at room temperature for
30 min. The resulting luminescence was measured using
the GloMax-Multi+ Detection System (Promega).

×100

Where “Experimental LDH release” is the signal
measured in a given treated sample, “spontaneous LDH
release” corresponds to the signal measured in target cells
exposed to vehicle control, and “maximum LDH release”
corresponds to the signal measured in the presence of
lysed tumor cells.

Nuclear morphology and apoptosis evaluation
Apoptotic nuclei were detected using DNA-binding
stain Hoechst. HCT116 cells stably expressing miR-143
or miR-145, and empty control cells, were seeded on
12-well plates over 18 mm glass coverslips, at a density
of 5 × 104 cells/well. Cells were exposed to 100 μg/ml

Total protein isolation and quantification
For isolation of total protein extracts, cells were
collected and lysed using ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM KAc, 0.5%

Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mM DTT, Halt
Protease and 1x Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) for 30 min. The lysates were then
sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 g, at 4°C, for 10 min.
Total proteins in the supernatant were recovered and
stored at –80°C. Protein concentrations were determined
using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Steady-state levels of Bcl-2 and PARP protein were
determined by immunoblot analysis. Briefly, 50 μg of
total protein extracts were separated on 10 or 12% SDSpolyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with
5% milk and incubated overnight with primary mouse
antibodies reactive to Bcl-2 (#sc-7382) or primary rabbit
antibody reactive to PARP (#sc-7150) (all from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA). Membranes were then
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibodies
(1:5000 dilution; Bio-Rad). For protein detection,
membranes were processed using Immobilon Western
Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Merck Millipore) or
Super Signal Femto substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA)
in a ChemiDoc MP System (Bio-Rad). β-actin (#A5541;
Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control. The relative
intensities of protein bands were quantified using the Image
Lab densitometric analysis program (version 4.1; Bio-Rad).
