ABSTRACT
Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often have an advanced disease
when firstly diagnosed. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). In this study, we retrospectively analyzed
the efficacy of cisplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab in previously treated advanced
NSCLC. Results showed that the objective response rate(ORR) of this novel regimen
is 43%, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to
6.7 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 11.4 months (95% CI, 8.8 to
13.9 months). Adverse events were generally mild, ranging from grade 1 to grade 3.
In conclusion, the combination of cisplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab obtained
promising results in selected patients with NSCLC. Randomized clinical trials are
needed to further investigate the efficacy of this regimen.

study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the use of bevacizumab as first-line therapy for
advanced NSCLC [20].
Till date, only single antitumor agents such as
erlotinib [21], docetaxel [22, 23] and pemetrexed [24],
are recommended in second line therapy. Platinumbased chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab may
be effective if patients failed in previously first-line
therapy of erlotinib or crizotinib. However, several studies
investigated the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with
chemotherapeutical drugs for previously treated NSCLC
[25–29]. These studies showed increased objective
response rate (ORR) and enhanced PFS when compared
with the standard second-line therapy.
The regimen of cisplatin plus pemetrexed is
extensively used for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC
in the clinic [30–36]. This combination produced
superior effect than that of cisplatin plus gemcitabine. In
addition, results from a phase III study showed improved
efficacy when adding bevacizumab to this regimen in
front line treatment [37]. Currently, there are no reports
concerning the combination of cisplatin, pemetrexed,
and bevacizumab for advanced NSCLC beyond first-line
settings. Hence, we retrospectively analyzed this regimen
for NSCLC patients in our Cancer Center.

INTRODUCTION
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the
most common carcinoma worldwide [1]. The prognosis
of patients with advanced NSCLC is poor, with a median
progression-free survival (PFS) of 4–6 months and
median overall survival (OS) of 8–10 months [2–7].
Patients harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib [8] and gefitinib [9].
However, for patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC,
platinum-based chemotherapy is still used for front line
treatment.
Angiogenesis is necessary for cancer cells to
proliferate and metastasize. The vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) could promote tumor angiogenesis [10–12].
Previous studies indicate that VEGF is over expressed
in several malignant tumors [13, 14]. Bevacizumab is a
monoclonal antibody against VEGF receptor, hence exerts
antitumor effect by inhibiting abnormal vascular growth
in malignant tumors [15–18]. When adding bevacizumab
to platinum-based chemotherapy in the E4599 study,
the median OS of nonsquamous NSCLC patients was
prolonged to one year (12.3 months), with relatively
tolerable toxicities [19]. Based on results from the above

RESULTS

all patients received bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), cisplatin (75
mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) administered every 3
weeks. Dexamethasone, folic acid and vitamin B12 were
administered routinely and treatment continued until patients
having a progressed disease. Treatment sustained for at least
2 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
or economic factors. A median of 4 cycles were administered
in this study.

Patient characteristics and treatment
The number of eligible patients in our study was 7.
The clinical characteristics of these patients are listed in
Table 1. Among all the patients, 5 patients (71%) were < 60
years of age (median 50 years; range 28–63 years) and 6
patients (86%) were male. Most patients had a performance
status of 1 score and adenocarcinoma subtype (both 86%).
Two patients (29%) were EGFR gene mutated, three patients
(42%) were wild-type and the remaining two patients (29%)
were not taken gene sequencing. Patients had received at least
one line of therapy before the initial treatment. In our study,

Efficacy
As is illustrated in Table 2, disease control of this
novel combination was observed in 6 of 7 NSCLC patients

response rate was 43%. Only one patient obtained PD
after 2 cycle of therapy. Median PFS was 5.2 months (95%
CI, 3.7 to 6.7 months, Figure 1) and median OS was 11.4
months (95% CI, 8.8 to 13.9 months, Figure 2).

In our former study, we investigated the
chemotherapeutic regimen of pemetrexed plus
bevacizumab in previously treated NSCLC [29]. Results
showed that disease control rate was 54.84%, median
PFS was 4.37 months and median OS was 15.83 months.
Toxicities of this combination treatment are generally
tolerable. According to the results of above studies, we
conducted this study analyzing the effect of cisplatin,
pemetrexed, and bevacizumab for advanced nonsquamous
NSCLC beyond first-line settings. This study showed
encouraging findings, with ORR 43%, median PFS 5.2
months and median OS 11.4months. Toxicities were also
manageable, which rarely produced grade 3 or higher
adverse events. These results may possibly due to the
young population and good performance status of patients
in our study (all are ≤ 65 years and PS ≤ 1). As the number
of patients in this study was relatively small, additional
studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy of this
combination beyond first-line setting.
In the study, all patients received EGFR TKIs
treatment before the combination therapy. The period
ranged from 1 to 14 months, the median therapeutic
time was 7 months. After failed from oral EGFR TKIs
treatment, patients received salvage therapy of cisplatin,
pemetrexed, and bevacizumab for a median time of 4
cycles. The median number of therapeutic time is thirdline. Four patients took another EGFR TKIs after failed
from this treatment, a strategy according to previous
reports. One of the four patients was later found to be ALK
fusing gene mutated and received crizotinib for about 1
year. Therefore, the combination regimen of cisplatin,
pemetrexed, and bevacizumab enhanced overall survival
of patients with advanced NSCLC.
In previous studies, the dose of bevacizumab
as second-line or beyond was 15 mg/kg, such as that
administered in the E4599 study. The AVAiL study
compared the effect of bevacizumab in different doses
(7.5 and 15 mg/kg) in combination with chemotherapy
[40]. Results showed that both low and high dose level
of bevacizumab enhanced median PFS compared to

Adverse events
Main toxicities possibly related to therapy are listed
in Table 3. Adverse events of this chemotherapeutical
regimen were generally mild, ranging from grade 1 to
grade 3. Hematologic toxicities observed in the study
were mainly grade 1. The most common grade 2 adverse
events were non-hematologic toxicities, including 4
episodes of nausea and 3 episodes of anorexia and fatigue.
Grade 3 toxicities were anorexia (42.9%), fatigue (28.6%)
and nausea (14.3%). No patients in the study had severe
adverse events.

DISCUSSION
Standard second-line treatments for patients with
advanced NSCLC are mainly single agents. For third-line or
beyond therapy, possible choices are erlotinib (regardless of
EGFR gene status), crizotinib (if ALK fusing gene existed),
clinical trial or best support therapy. Bevacizumab showed
encouraging efficacy as first-line therapy for nonsquamous
NSCLC patients. In the AVAPEAL study, the treatment
results were increased when adding bevacizumab to the
combination of cisplatin plus pemetrexed.
Bevacizumab showed increased efficacy in previously
treated advanced NSCLC when combined with erlotinib
[38, 39]. In one study, the response rates of bevacizumab plus
erlotinib was 51.3%, median PFS and OS was 4.4 and 13.7
months, respectively [39]. The combination of bevacizumab,
oxaliplatin and pemetrexed for previously treated NSCLC
was also investigated [26]. Clinical beneficial rate was
71% and median PFS and OS was 5.8 and 12.5 months,
respectively. These studies suggested that bevacizumab may
benefit patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC in
second-line or beyond settings.

chemotherapy alone arm. In the later AVAPEAL study,
researchers used the low dose level (7.5 mg/kg) and
also produced favorable results [37]. Nowadays, there
are no reports concerning 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab plus
chemotherapy for previously treated advanced NSCLC.
In addition, the prescription of bevacizumab seems
expensive for patients living in developing countries. Our
study showed that the dose of 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab also
works when combined to cisplatin and pemetrexed in the
second-line and beyond settings.
In conclusion, the combination of cisplatin,
pemetrexed, and bevacizumab obtained promising efficacy

in selected patients with previously treated NSCLC.
More clinical trials are needed to further elaborate the
relationship between this novel regimen and advanced
NSCLC in sencon-line or beyond setting.

criteria. Disease control was defined as complete
remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or stable disease
(SD). Patients who had a progression disease after
two cycles of treatment were defined as progression
disease (PD). PFS was defined as time between the start
of the treatment and disease progression or death. OS
was defined as time between the start of the treatment
and last contact or death. Toxicities were recorded and
classified in the light of the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0.

Data collection
The clinical data of patients in our studies were
collected carefully. All the patients had an ECOG PS
of 0 to 1. Patient history, physical examination and
complete blood work were recorded at baseline and
before each cycle of treatment. Tumor response was
evaluated by computed tomography scans according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
