BACKGROUND: Intracranial involvement in multiple myeloma is extremely rare. The effect of new drugs (eg, thalidomide, bortezomib, lenalidomide) with respect to old drugs (eg, alkylators, steroids) has not been reported. METHODS: We collected clinical and biological data of patients presenting with an osteo-dural or primary dural multiple
myeloma (OD-DMM) or a central nervous system myelomatosis (CNS-MM) by sending a questionnaire to the centers
of the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell’Adulto (GIMEMA). RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were registered.
New therapies were used in 35 patients, whereas 15 patients received old treatments. Twenty-five out of 50 patients
obtained a complete remission or a very good partial remission (CRþVGPR). Overall survival (OS) for CNS-MM was 6
months, for OD-DMM 25 months. OS was 25 months for patients treated with new agents versus 8 months with old
agents. Improved OS and progression-free survival were predicted by response (CRþVGPR) and by patients who
underwent stem cell transplantation versus chemotherapy. b2-Microglobulin >5 mmol/L was a poor prognostic factor.
Multivariate analysis showed poor survival for patients with b2-microglobulin >5 mmol/L and better survival for
patients achieving CRþVGPR. CONCLUSIONS: The overall data highlight the relevance of therapy with new drugs in

INTRODUCTION
Intracranial involvement in multiple myeloma (IC-MM) is a rare extramedullary presentation and/or complication
of MM.1-14 This generally results from osteodural or primary dural multiple myeloma (OD-DMM). Extramedullary
tumor masses most frequently arise from bone lesions in the cranial vault, skull base, nose, or paranasal sinuses, whereas
primary dural (pachymeningeal) involvement is rare. Central nervous system myelomatosis (CNS-MM)ie,

leptomeningeal involvement
is rare and accounts for
approximately 1% of patients with MM. Primary parenchymal brain lesions without osseous or dural contact
without leptomeningeal involvement are even rarer.
Given the lack of clinical series and the peculiar localization within a ‘‘sanctuary’’, the management of IC-MM is
currently a clinical challenge. This may also result from
the nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which constitutes a natural protection from several drugs that are commonly used for the treatment of MM.15 There are diverse
treatments, including systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal
therapy (IT), and radiotherapy (RT), with median survivals of 1 month or less for CNS-MM and 1 year or less for
OD-DMM.2 RT has been the best therapy reported so far
for both of these particular types of MM.
Recent discoveries on the fundamental molecular
mechanisms behind MM cell growth and survival have
led to the introduction of novel classes of pharmacologic
agents such as the immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib).16 Treatment of MM has
changed in the last decade, with a significant improvement in response rate and survival.17 However, the activity of new drugs against IC-MM is largely unknown.
Although bortezomib does not cross the BBB, and thalidomide and lenalidomide are reported by the manufacturer to have only a minimal crossover, their activity
against intracranial tumors other than MM has been
described, conceivably because of disruption of the BBB
and increased vascular permeability within the tumor.18
Even though many MM trials have been performed
to test overall response and survival with new agents alone
or in combination, nobody has ever reported on the effect
of the new agents on IC-MM, except for a few case
reports.19,20
In this study, we collected clinical and biological
data of patients presenting with IC-MM from 2000 to
2010. The goal of the study was to 1) characterize the ICMM clinical outcome, 2) identify the prognostic factors
associated with the course of IC-MM, and 3) verify the
impact of new drugs on the management of IC-MM.

images show an expansile and infiltrative bone lesion of the right petrous apex with intracranial growth and infiltration of the adjacent pachymeninx (arrows) and the ipsilateral Meckel’s cave (black arrowhead). The white arrowhead indicates the normal left
Meckel’s cave.

Gadolinium-enhanced T1weighted sagittal (A), coronal (B), and axial (C) magnetic resonance images show multifocal infiltrative contrast-enhanced leptomeningeal neoplastic tissue in the cerebellar folia (white arrows) and interpeduncular (black arrow) and opticochiasmatic cistern

data and on the neuro-imaging description of the lesions.
Six patients have already been reported on.1,19,23 A group
of 50 patients with MM matched for clinical and prognostic characteristics but without IC involvement was
chosen retrospectively and used as a control in the evaluation of OS (see Table 1, Figure 3A).
Patterns of Intracranial Involvement
Neuroimaging, CSF examination, and surgery resulted in
the diagnosis and definition of the pattern of IC-MM as
OD-DMM or CNS-MM.1 OD-DMM usually results
from direct spreading from contiguous bone lesions (Figure 1), because the dura mater or pachymeninx is a relatively avascular structure, and neoplastic cells usually

1576

reach the subdural space by breaching the inner table and
fibrous dura of the skull. Primary dural or pachymeningeal involvement is rare. CNS-MM is defined by the presence of monoclonal plasma cells in the CSF,16 and
possible evidence of disease in the leptomeningeal spaces
at neuroimaging (Figure 2). Leptomeningeal spread of
MM is thought to be hematogenous, following a mechanism comparable to that of leukemic meningitis. Notably,
autopsy studies in patients with leptomeningeal MM have
demonstrated that circulating myeloma cells can infiltrate
arachnoid veins diffusely, resulting in destruction of
arachnoid trabeculae, and that myeloma cells can spill
over into the cerebrospinal fluid.24 Primary parenchymal
brain lesions have been reported sporadically and may be

Treatment Modalities
We categorized IC-MM treatments as follows (see Table 2): bortezomib-based, thalidomide-based, lenalidomide-based (novel agents); melphalan-prednisone,
vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide (old agents); and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), allogeneic SCT, IT, RT, neurosurgery. SCT

following follow-up data were collected: type of response
to IC-MM, date of progression, date of death, and date of
last follow-up.
Efficacy Assessments
Response was evaluated according to International Working Group uniform response criteria.25 Additionally, a
complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of the mass in IC-MM, as well as a complete disappearance of monoclonal plasma cells in the CSF for
CNS-MM. A very good partial remission (VGPR) was
defined as a reduction of 75% of the mass, a PR a 50%
reduction of the mass. A reduction of <50% of the mass
was defined as a nonresponse (NR).Overall survival (OS)
was calculated from IC-MM diagnosis until last followup or death. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from IC-MM diagnosis until reappearance or progression of disease.
Statistical Analysis
OS and PFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. The log-rank test was used to compare survival
curves. Categorical variables were compared by chi-square
or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. Multivariate Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to
compare variables. The HR was adjusted taking death as
the dependent variable for OS and relapse/progression for
PFS. Covariates in the multivariate analysis were: age at
the time of the IC-MM diagnosis (<65 or >65 years),
CNS-MM or OD-DMM, IC-MM at diagnosis versus
relapse; b2-microglobulin (<5 or >5 mmol/L), IC-MM
treatment with new drugs (yes/no), SCT (yes/no), and
type of response (CRþVGPR or PRþNR). Statistical
analyses were performed using MedCalc software (MedCalc Software, Broekstraat, Mariakerke, Belgium). Significance was set at P ¼ .05.

RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics
The study was based on a cohort of 50 patients (26
women and 24 men) (Table 1). The median age at ICMM diagnosis was 64 years (range, 39-82 years). IC-MM
was documented at MM diagnosis in 18/50 (36%)
patients and at disease relapse in 32/50 (64%) patients.
Four of 12 (33%) patients with CNS-MM showed
involvement at diagnosis, whereas 14/38 (36%) patients
with OD-DMM had cranial involvement at diagnosis.
The median time from MM diagnosis to IC-MM relapse

1577

was 14 months (range, 1-104 months). The symptoms
declared were headaches (31%), confusion (27%), visual
disturbances (35%), weakness of the extremities (13%),
cranial nerve palsies (21%), paresthesias (8%), vertigo
(4%), and seizures (4%). The type of monoclonal protein
was immunoglobulin G in 23/50 (46%) patients (k20,
k3), immunoglobulin A in 15/50 (30%) patients (k9,
k6), light chain in 7/50 (14%) patients (k3, k4), and nonsecretory in 3/50 (6%) patients. One patient had only 1
primitive IC plasmacytoma. Another had a concomitant
extramedullary localization in the lung. b2-Microglobulin
was available in 40 patients, with a median value of 3.2
mmol/L (range, 1.1-25.7 mmol/L). b2-Microglobulin
was <3.5 mmol/L in 18/40 cases, >3.5 mmol/L and
<5.5 mmol/L in 13/40 patients, and >5.5 mmol/L in 9/
40 patients. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow plasma
cells was performed in 10 cases [6 normal, 4 abnormal
with del(13q)]. FISH on bone marrow plasma cells was
available in 19 cases at IC localization. Overall, 78% of
patients showed genomic abnormalities, the more frequent being in order del(13q),t(11;14) and del(17p).
Cytogenetic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid was available
in 2 patients who both showed a complex karyotype. At
diagnosis, head magnetic resonance imaging was the preferred neuroimaging technique and had been performed
on 34 of the 50 patients, and computed tomography had
been performed on the remaining 16 patients. Biopsies
had been performed on 15 patients.
Patterns of Intracranial Involvement
OD-DMM involvement was present in 38/50 (76%)
patients, and CNS-MM was present in 12/50 (24%)
patients. Three of the patients with OD-DMM had primary dural involvement. Three patients with OD-DMM
showed parenchymal infiltration. No primary parenchymal MM had been reported. IC-MM involvement led to
MM diagnosis in 13 of the 38 patients with OD-DMM
and 5 of the 12 patients with CNS-MM.
Treatment
Twenty-four out of 50 (48%) patients received systemic
treatment for IC-MM, 18/50 (36%) patients received systemic treatment plus RT, 4/50 (8%) patients received systemic treatment plus RT plus IT, 3/50 (6%) patients
received RT, and 1/50 (2%) patients received RT plus IT.
Systemic treatment included novel agents: bortezomibbased regimens in 25 patients, thalidomide-based regimens in 11 patients, and lenalidomide-based regimens in
4 patients. Old agents were as follows: melphalan-predni-

1578

sone in 7 patients, vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone in 3 patients, cyclophosphamide in 4 patients, and
other treatments in 3 patients. High-dose treatment followed by SCT (8 autologous, 4 allogeneic) was administered to 12/50 patients (24%) (Table 2).
Response
After treatment, an objective response was documented in
34/50 (70%) patients (25 CRþVGPR), whereas symptoms disappeared in 23/50 (45%) patients. The responses
according to treatment received are shown in Table 2.
The median OS for CNS-MM was 6 months (range, 1-23
months), the median OS for OD-DMM was 25 months
(range, 1-80 months), and the median OS for the MM
control group was 46 months (range, 1-106 months) (Figure 3A). Eight of 12 (66%) patients with CNS-MM died
(Table 3), whereas 17 of 38 (44%) patients with ODDMM died. An example of response to treatment is given
in Figure 4.
Univariate analysis

Response (CRþVGPR vs PRþNR) was predictive
of improved survival in all IC-MM patients (NR vs 12, P
¼ .004) and in both CNS-MM and OD-DMM patients
(NR vs 5, P ¼ .008; NR vs 20, P ¼ .03, respectively) (Table 4, Figure 3C and 3E). This was also true for SCT versus chemotherapy in IC-MM and OD-DMM patients (P
¼ .03). No difference was seen in patients receiving RT
versus no RT (P ¼ .6), whereas a difference was seen in
patients receiving new agents þ RT versus other treatments (P ¼ .001). b2-Microglobulin >5 mmol/L was a
poor prognostic factor (P ¼ .002), whereas age >65 years
was not a poor prognostic factor. FISH results did not
have a significant impact on outcome. PFS for IC-MM
was significantly better when b2-microglobulin was <5
mmol/L (P ¼ .004); in new agents versus old agents (P ¼
.02) (Figure 3B and 3D); in SCT versus chemotherapy (P
¼ .06); and in RT þ new agents versus other treatments
(P ¼ .02). OS and PFS were not statistically significant in
CNS-MM when comparing new agents with old agents
(P ¼ .7 and P ¼ .3, respectively), although a trend for better survival after administration of new agents was seen in
PFS (Figure 3F and 3G). No statistical difference was seen
in OS for patients with IC-MM at diagnosis or after
relapse.

DISCUSSION
IC-MM is a rare extramedullary presentation and complication of MM, with very short survivals reported. It is
noteworthy that, although our study was retrospective, it
allowed us to assemble the largest series reported to date
of patients with IC-MM.
Although bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide have produced outstanding results in the clinical
outcomes of both young and elderly patients, the impact
of new agents on IC-MM has never been reported in the
literature except for rare case reports.

1580

A different clinical outcome between CNS-MM
(median OS, 6 months) and OD-DMM (median OS, 25
months) seems to be consistent with the different anatomy and physiology of the 2 districts studied. Although
median survivals of IC-MM patients are still unsatisfactory with respect to the general MM population, surprising positive results seem to emerge with the use of new
agents, and a few considerations can be made.
Our study confirmed that b2-microglobulin was the
best prognostic factor, even in this particular group of
MM. In particular, univariate and multivariate analysis
produced significant statistics.
The best responses (CRþVGPR) were still confirmed as surrogate for longer survival. This finding
reflects the increased efficacy of new agents with respect to
old agents. SCT represents a valid opportunity for

younger eligible patients, and new agents plus SCT appear
to represent optimal treatment. SCT has been reported in
the past as a treatment capable of prolonging survival,
even in the era of old agents, suggesting that dose intensification could be important in this set of patients.26 Highdose melphalan, in particular, has been reported as more
efficacious than other drugs.27,28 This efficacy seems to be
confirmed by our study, even though when SCT was associated with the treatment with new agents, better results
were obtained. Even though SCT is currently the standard
for care in younger eligible patients with MM, its benefit
seems to be more evident in the low-risk disease than in
high-risk disease because of the high relapse rate due to its
aggressiveness. The benefit seen in the past in patients
with IC-MM, which is by definition a high-risk disease,
could be related to the efficient debulking of the disease
by new agents before transplantation and to the capability
of a high-dose regimen to deliver enough melphalan such
that some of the drug crosses the BBB. Nonetheless, the
small number of patients described, combined with the
fact that IC-MM plasma cells were studied less (with
genetics and immunophenotype) than those of the normal
MM population, make risk stratification and clear conclusions difficult.
Due to the scarcity of drugs capable of crossing the
BBB, RT has been reported to be the best therapy for cranial MM.29,30 This finding was not confirmed in our
study. In fact, RT significantly improved the outcome
only when associated with new agents. A reason for this
greatly improved efficacy could be the synergism between
bortezomib and RT in killing plasma cells.
Contrary to some reports in which plasma cell leukemia seemed to be as frequent as in 20% of CNS-MM
cases,2 we only had 1 case of plasma cell leukemia with
CNS involvement.
FISH was not predictive of prognosis, and del(13q)
was the most frequent abnormality. In contrast to what
was reported in 1 study31 in which del(17p) was a frequent abnormality in CNS-MM, we observed only 1

1582

patient with del(17p) who did very poorly with an NR
and had a survival of 2 months. In the 19 cases studied
with FISH, novel agents seemed to overcome the poor
prognosis of some chromosomal abnormalities for ICMM, a finding that is in line with reports on the general
myeloma population,32 even though the number of cases
studied was insufficient for reaching clear conclusions.
Considering the caution dictated by the limits of a
retrospective study, our results are quite surprising. ODDMM does not seem to be a very poor prognostic factor
per se with the advent of new and more effective drugs.
PFS is significantly better when comparing the use of new
agents versus old agents in OD-DMM, confirming that
this type of cranial involvement has a better prognosis
with respect to CNS disease. Patients’ cranial mass can be
reduced and even disappear completely after therapy.
Moreover, the good response to IC-MM allows patients
to be mobilized and allows their stem cells to be transplanted. RT seems to lengthen survival, but only when
associated with treatment using new agents. Even more
particular is the response, although minimal, observed in
4 patients with CNS-MM. Three patients were treated
with new agents (median follow-up, 12 months) and only
1 patient was treated with old drugs (follow-up, 23
months). Even though the number of patients with CNSMM was small and could thus not produce significant statistics for the OS and PFS, a trend for better PFS seemed
to emerge in the group of patients treated with new agents
(Figure 3F). The benefit of response versus PFS in intracranial myeloma (high risk) may be related to the fact that
drugs can reach the tumor, and efficacy is for the very first
time increased for some patients (in the past, median survivals were dismal [ie, 1 month or less for CNS disease]).
None then less the type of myeloma involvement (cranial)
does not permit to achieve disease plateau, and when the
disease does not respond, it rapidly causes death. It is notable that all the above-mentioned new drugs do not seem
to cross the BBB, even though just a few cases have been
reported with thalidomide efficacy in CNS-MM where

penetration through the BBB had been demonstrated.3336
An interesting and fascinating theory could be that
meningism/inflammation or angiogenesis (as seen in glioblastomas)37 can allow increased vascular permeability
resulting in the deterioration of the BBB, allowing some
of these more efficient new drugs to pass through it. A
recent phase 1 trial in which bortezomib was used in glioblastomas seems to confirm this.36 Unfortunately, drug
testing in the CSF was not possible in our study. Another
explanation could be the effect of new drugs on MM-produced cytokines and in particular against vascular endothelial growth factor or angiogenesis.
Finally, we are fully aware of the limits of a retrospective study. Nonetheless, due to the particular rarity
and aggressiveness of this type of myeloma, we believe
that the importance of our study lies in the largest series of
patients ever reported on, and in the unexpectedly good
results obtained. The rarity of IC-MM cases makes prospective studies difficult to perform, but the overall data
of our study highlight the therapeutic relevance of therapies with new drugs in IC-MM, thus providing a framework for future collaborative clinical trials.
