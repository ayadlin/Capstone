BACKGROUND: Few data are available on second-line chemotherapy (CT2) for advanced biliary tract cancer (ABTC). The aim of this
multicenter study was to describe the CT2 regimens used, the response rates, and the outcomes of patients treated with various CT2
regimens. METHODS: Patients who received CT2 for ABTC at 17 French institutions after the failure of the gemcitabine-platinum combination were retrospectively studied. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier
method. Cox models were used for multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Among 603 patients who received first-line chemotherapy (CT1)
for ABTC, 196 received CT2: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan (n 5 64), 5-FU and oxaliplatin (n 5 21), 5-FU and cisplatin (n 5 38),
5-FU or capecitabine (n 5 40), sunitinib (n 5 10), or other various regimens (n 5 23). Among the 186 assessable patients, there were
22 partial responses and 70 stabilizations. After a median follow-up of 26.4 months, the median PFS and OS were 3.2 and 6.7 months,
respectively. There was no significant difference in PFS or OS between CT2 regimens. Fluoropyrimidine-based doublet chemotherapy
was not superior to fluoropyrimidine alone in terms of OS and PFS. In a multivariate analysis, a performance status of 0 to 1, disease
control with CT1, and a carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level  400 IU/mL were significantly associated with longer PFS and OS.
Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 32% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: CT2 might provide disease control for selected patients with
ABTC after the failure of gemcitabine-platinum, but the prognosis remains poor. No particular regimen seems superior to others, and
this calls for new treatments. A good performance status, disease control with CT1, and a low level of CA 19-9 were associated with

INTRODUCTION
Biliary tract cancer is a rare malignancy carrying a poor prognosis, often because of a late diagnosis. The estimated annual
incidence is 10,650 cases in the United States and approximately 10,000 cases in Europe.1 Most tumors are diagnosed at
an advanced stage, and approximately 25% are resectable at diagnosis. Despite complete resection, however, most patients

experience a recurrence, and the 5-year overall survival
(OS) rate is less than 10%.2,3 Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer (ABTC)
and has been shown to improve OS in comparison with
best supportive care (BSC) alone.4,5 Recently, the
gemcitabine-cisplatin (GEMCIS) combination was identified as the new standard first-line chemotherapy (CT1)
after the Advanced Biliary Cancer 02 (ABC-02) phase 3
trial showed its superiority over gemcitabine alone in
terms of OS.6 The gemcitabine-oxaliplatin (GEMOX)
combination is commonly used as an alternative to GEMCIS in several countries, including France, because it
showed similar antitumor activity and a favorable toxicity
profile in phase 2 and 3 studies of patients with ABTC.7
These recent therapeutic advances allow second-line
chemotherapy (CT2) to be envisaged for some patients.
Approximately half of patients still have a good performance status (PS) after disease progression during CT1, and
25% to 50% of them undergo further treatment.8 However, there is no standard second-line regimen, and there
are no randomized studies showing a greater benefit from
CT2 versus BSC alone. Moreover, there is currently no
way of identifying which patients might benefit from
CT2.
CT2 regimens and targeted agents have so far been
evaluated only in nonrandomized prospective and retrospective studies.9,10 These studies showed a median OS
and progression-free survival (PFS) of 4.8 to 13.5 and 1.6
to 5.4 months, respectively, with objective response rates
ranging from 2% to 33%. Most available studies of conventional CT2 are small and retrospective, and some of
them have included patients with pancreatic cancers; in
addition, the gemcitabine-platinum combination was not
the standard first-line treatment in most of them.
The aim of this large multicenter study was to
describe the CT2 regimens used in clinical practice, to
determine the response rates and outcomes of patients
with ABTC treated with CT2 after progression on the
standard gemcitabine-platinum combination, and to
identify prognostic factors in this setting.

from tumor registries of pathology departments and medical databases at each hospital. All consecutive patients
with histologically or cytologically proven locally
advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer who received
CT2 between November 2002 and December 2013 after
the failure of gemcitabine plus platinum were eligible for
this study. When platinum had to be stopped for neuropathy or other toxicities, the first-line treatment was continued with gemcitabine alone until progression, and the
second-line treatment was then introduced. Patients with
ampullary tumors were excluded. Biliary tract cancer consisted of intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
and gallbladder cancer. The first-line treatment had to
consist of either GEMCIS (gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2
and cisplatin at 25 mg/m2, each on days 1 and 8 of a 21day regimen) or GEMOX (gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2
and oxaliplatin at 100 or 85 mg/m2 every 2 weeks).
Data Collection

The patients’ medical records were reviewed to collect relevant data on demographics, tumor characteristics, surgery, biliary stenting, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) PS, responses to CT1, and serum levels
of albumin, bilirubin, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA
19-9) before the start of CT2. For CT2, we recorded toxicity, tumor responses, and the date of disease progression.
The survival status at the last follow-up was used to calculate OS.
The tumor response was assessed in patents with
measurable disease by means of computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version
1.0).11 Toxicity was graded according to the National
Cancer Institute’s common toxicity criteria (version 4.0)
except for oxaliplatin-related peripheral neuropathy,
which was graded with an oxaliplatin-specific scale: grade
1 indicates short-lasting paresthesia with complete regression before the next cycle, grade 2 indicates persistent paresthesia or dysesthesia without functional impairment,
and grade 3 indicates persistent functional impairment.12
Information on third-line chemotherapy was also
collected.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

CT2 Regimens and Follow-Up

This study was reviewed and approved by the French
national institutional authority (Advisory Committee on
Information Processing in Material Research in the Field
of Health). It was conducted at 13 university hospitals, 1
general hospital, 2 private hospitals, and 1 comprehensive
cancer care center in France. Patient files were retrieved

The main regimens used for CT2 were as follows:
LV5FU2 (folinic acid at 400 mg/m2 on day 1, 5fluorouracil [5-FU] bolus at 400 mg/m2 on day 1, and 5FU infusion at 2400 mg/m2 over the course of 46 hours
every 2 weeks), FOLFIRI (LV5FU2 plus irinotecan at
180 mg/m2 on day 1) or FOLFIRI.3 (LV5FU2 plus

irinotecan at 90 mg/m2 on days 1 and 3), XELIRI (capecitabine at 2000 mg/m2/day on days 1-14 and irinotecan at
200 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks), FOLFOX (LV5FU2
plus oxaliplatin at 100 mg/m2 on day 1 every 2 weeks),
XELOX (capecitabine at 2000 mg/m2/day on days 1-14
and oxaliplatin at 130 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks),
LV5FU2 plus cisplatin (50 mg/m2 on day 1 every 2
weeks), capecitabine (2000 mg/m2/day on days 1-14 every 3 weeks), and sunitinib (37.5 mg/day orally). Other
regimens were grouped together because they were highly
variable and each was used in very few patients.
Statistical Analysis

OS was defined as the period from the first day of CT2 to
death from any cause. Data on patients who were alive at
the end of follow-up (December 2013) were regarded as
censored. PFS was defined as the period from the first day
of CT2 to the date of first disease progression or death
from any cause. PFS and OS were estimated from
Kaplan-Meier curves. An univariate analysis of the link
between each variable and PFS/OS used the log-rank test.
A 2-sided P value less than .05 was considered significant
in the univariate analysis. A multivariate analysis was then
performed with stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, with statistical significance set at P < .05
for a 2-sided test. Cox models including interesting clinicopathologic variables were used to determine the association of each variable with OS or PFS. Only variables with
a P value < .10 in the univariate analysis were introduced
into the Cox model. Relative risks were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All
statistical analyses were performed with R software (version 2.13; R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Among the 603 patients who received CT1 with the
gemcitabine-platinum combination, 196 patients (32.5%)
received CT2.
The characteristics of the patients at the beginning
of CT2 are summarized in Table 1. The median age was
63 years (range, 28-82 years). Seventy-nine patients
(40.3%) had previously undergone surgery with curative
intent. Most of the patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1
(67.6%), an intrahepatic primary tumor location (50%),
and metastatic disease (93.9%). The vast majority of
patients (93.4%) received GEMOX as their first-line
treatment. The best response to CT1 was an objective
response in 31.1% of cases and stable disease in 35.2%.

drugs (phase 1 trials). In all, 173 patients (88%) received
5-FU–based chemotherapy, and 67 (34.2%) received
platinum-based chemotherapy.
Toxicity of CT2

One hundred sixty-two patients were assessable for toxicity. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurred in 45 patients (32%).
The main severe toxicities are described in Table 3. Peripheral neuropathy was most frequent in patients receiving oxaliplatin or cisplatin (any grade, 63%; grade 3,
2.5%). The LV5FU2-cisplatin regimen was associated
with more severe anemia (12%) and neutropenia (38%),
whereas FOLFIRI was associated with more severe diarrhea (20%) and neutropenia (44%), and FOLFOX was
associated with more severe thrombocytopenia (33%).
Chemotherapy was discontinued in 22 patients (13.6%)

because of limiting toxicity or patient refusal. The
LV5FU2-cisplatin combination was discontinued in 38%
of cases, mainly because of renal failure. Three deaths
were attributed to serious adverse effects, namely functional renal failure after diarrhea (FOLFIRI), organic renal failure (LV5FU2 and cisplatin), and hemolytic uremic
syndrome (gemcitabine and capecitabine). Infectious
events occurred in 19% of patients during CT2; the most
frequent was angiocholitis (39%).
Tumor Responses

The tumor response was assessable in 186 patients with
measurable disease. There were no complete responses, 22
partial responses (11.8%), and 70 cases of stable disease
(37.6%; Table 2). There was no statistically significant
difference in the objective response rates (range, 10%13.5%; P 5 .99) or disease control rates (DCRs; range,
41%-67%; P 5 .41) across the different regimens.
Survival

The median follow-up was 26.4 months (range, 0.5-55.4
months); the median PFS from the start of CT2 was 3.2
months (95% CI, 2.8-4.0) overall and 2.6 months (95%
CI, 1.9-3.7 months), 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.8-5.2

DISCUSSION
In this retrospective, multicenter study, almost one-third
of the patients with ABTC received CT2. To our knowledge, this is the largest study describing response rates and
patient outcomes after CT2 in a homogeneous population
of ABTC patients who all received first-line treatment
with the gemcitabine-platinum combination, which is
now considered the frontline standard of care after the
ABC-02 study. In our study, only 7% of patients received
gemcitabine plus cisplatin as the first-line treatment,
whereas the remainder received the GEMOX combination. Our results reflect routine practices and, therefore,
highlight the preferential use of GEMOX in France based
on its antitumor activity and favorable toxicity profile in
ABTC patients13-16; GEMOX was also the standard
chemotherapy in the control arms of recent randomized
studies.17,18
To our knowledge, only 2 previous studies evaluated
CT2 after the gemcitabine-platinum combination. In
those studies, the median time to progression was 3.1 to 4
months, OS was 8 months, and DCR was 62%; this is
comparable to our results.19,20 In the largest published
retrospective study, which included 96 patients, CT1 regimens were heterogeneous and consisted of the
gemcitabine-platinum combination in only 19% of
cases.21 The other available data on CT2 for ABTC have
been derived from small, nonrandomized phase 2 or retrospective studies.9,10
Fluoropyrimidines (especially S-1) were some of the
main CT2s tested, with very varied survival rates reported
for gemcitabine-refractory Asian patients.22-24 In addition
to single agents, combinations of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted therapies have been
assessed with conflicting or disappointing results.25-30

Among them, sunitinib recently showed promising results
in 53 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas
with median PFS and OS times of 5.2 and 9.6 months,
respectively, a DCR of 86%, and good tolerance.31 Such
promising results have been observed in the 10 patients (8
with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) receiving sunitinib
in our study (DCR, 66%; PFS, 4.6 months; OS, 8.4
months). None of them participated in the aforementioned phase 2 study. Although there was no statistically
significant difference in comparison with other regimens,
sunitinib seemed to be associated with prolonged survival,
but the patients receiving this targeted therapy in our
study were highly selected, and their numbers were too
small to draw any conclusion. A prospective, randomized
study is mandatory for confirming the efficacy of sunitinib in this setting.
As a result, no standard second-line therapy regimen
has yet emerged, and no patient characteristics that might
predict the benefits of CT2 have been identified. Our large
multicenter study was thus aimed at providing information
on the response rates and survival of patients treated with
the main regimens used in clinical practice in the absence
of guidelines, recommendations, and patient selection criteria. Despite a DCR of almost 50%, tumor control was
not long maintained by CT2 in light of the short median
PFS that we report, which is quite similar to that reported
in previous studies9,21,22,32,33; this underlines the poor
prognosis of ABTC. This modest efficacy of CT2 is all the
more disappointing because the median PFS was probably
overestimated by the reassessment time interval between 2
and 3 months, which complied with clinical practice but
introduced a bias into our study. Moreover, we probably
selected patients with a better prognosis because all the
patients included in our study previously received the
standard gemcitabine-platinum combination; we excluded
those treated with gemcitabine alone. Finally, the heterogeneity of the regimens used, the small number of patients
assigned to each regimen, and the nonrandomized, retrospective nature are major limitations of our study, which
lacks the statistical power needed to make any meaningful
conclusions about the potential efficacy of CT2 and the
choice of one regimen in comparison with the others.
In our study, fluoropyrimidine-based doublet chemotherapy had no noteworthy advantages over fluoropyrimidine alone, and this suggests that 5-FU or capecitabine
might be a reasonable option in this setting. However,
Walter et al21 reported conflicting results on this point,
and this should make us very cautious in our conclusions.
A systematic review using data from 25 studies and 761
patients with ABTC treated with a second-line treatment
3296

has been recently published and leads to the same conclusions.10 Reporting a mean OS of 7.2 months, a mean PFS
of 3.2 months, and a DCR of 49.5%, the authors rightly
concluded that CT2 appears to improve the survival
expected with BSC, but this may be due to a selection
bias, and no consensus exists for the most suitable regimen
to be used in these fit patients. Therefore, we cannot draw
any conclusions regarding the potential benefit of CT2
over BSC in ABTC patients progressing after gemcitabine
and platinum in the absence of a control arm. The
ongoing ABC-06 trial, comparing FOLFOX with BSC
after GEMCIS, is the first randomized trial designed to
answer this question (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01926236).
Our study shows that good PS, disease control by
CT1, and a low level of CA 19-9 are 3 independent prognostic factors associated with longer OS after CT2, and
this could help clinicians to select patients who may benefit from CT2. Previous studies have also shown the prognostic value of these parameters and underlined the
importance of offering patients a highly active frontline
regimen, which allows PFS > 6 months.21,34
Although similar to the rate reported in the ABC-02
trial,6 the 7.4% rate of biliary sepsis in our study seems
significantly lower than that observed in real life. These
infectious events, such as all other side effects reported in
our study, may have been underestimated by the retrospective collection of data and the short duration of the
second-line treatment.
In conclusion, in this large, retrospective, multicenter study, approximately one-third of the patients received
CT2 for ABTC after the failure of the standard
gemcitabine-platinum combination. CT2 was associated
with a tumor response or stable disease in approximately
one-half of the cases, but this disease control was not long
maintained because of the short median PFS, and the
prognosis of the ABTC patients remained poor. No particular regimen seemed superior to the others, but our
study had a number of limitations that prevented it from
properly evaluating the efficacy of CT2. A good PS (0
or 1), a CA 19-9 level  400 IU/mL, and disease control
with first-line treatment were associated with longer survival and should thus be taken into account when one is
selecting patients for second-line treatment. Anyway,
widespread use of CT2 cannot be currently recommended
for ABTC. The decision to treat should be made in each
case with the informed consent of patients, who must to
be clearly informed about the low magnitude of the benefit and the risk of side effects of CT2. Prospective,
randomized trials are still needed to demonstrate the
benefits of CT2 versus BSC and to evaluate new drugs.
