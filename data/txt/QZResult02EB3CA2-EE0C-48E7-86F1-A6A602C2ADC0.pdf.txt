ABSTRACT
Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common malignancies in young men.
Most patients with GCT can be cured with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy,
even in metastatic disease. In case of therapy resistance, prognosis is usually poor.
We investigated the potential of N-cadherin inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. We
analyzed the GCT cell lines NCCIT, NTERA-2, TCam-2, and the cisplatin-resistant sublines
NCCIT-R and NTERA-2R. Effects of a blocking antibody or siRNA against N-cadherin
on proliferation, migration, and invasion were investigated. Mouse xenografts of GCT
cell lines were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for N-cadherin expression. All
investigated GCT cell lines were found to express N-cadherin protein in vitro and in vivo.
Downregulation of N-cadherin in vitro leads to a significant inhibition of proliferation,
migration, and invasion. N-cadherin-downregulation leads to a significantly higher level
of pERK. N-cadherin-inhibition resulted in significantly higher rates of apoptotic cells in
caspase-3 staining. Expression of N-cadherin is preserved in cisplatin-resistant GCT cells,
pointing to an important physiological role in cell survival. N-cadherin-downregulation
results in a significant decrease of proliferation, migration, and invasion and stimulates
apoptosis in cisplatin-naive and resistant GCT cell lines. Therefore, targeting N-cadherin
may be a promising therapeutic approach, particularly in cisplatin-resistant, therapy
refractory and metastatic GCT.

intratubular germ cell neoplasia (IGCNU) [3]. Patients
with metastatic GCTs can be cured in about 80% of cases
by using cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy
[4, 5]. However, patients with multiple relapses have an
unfavorable prognosis, and long-term survival can be
achieved in only 10–15% of these patients [6, 7]. Therefore,
new treatment options for refractory GCTs are needed.
For in vitro studies, several GCT cell lines are
available. TCam-2 shows seminoma characteristics,
whereas NCCIT and NTERA-2 model embryonic
carcinomas [8, 9]. Two cisplatin-resistant GCT cell lines,

INTRODUCTION
Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common
malignancies in young men between 15–40 years. The
incidence of GCT has been constantly increasing over the
last 40 years [1]. Distinction of the different histological
subtypes is essential for the therapeutic management.
Non-seminomas can be further subdivided into embryonic
carcinomas (EC), yolk sac tumors (YS), chorionic
carcinomas (CC), and teratomas (TER) [2]. Seminomas
and non-seminomas have a common precursor called

NTERA-2R and NCCIT-R, were established to investigate
mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in vitro [10].
Cadherins are Ca2+-dependent transmembrane
glycoproteins belonging to the group of adhesion molecules.
More than 80 different members of cadherins are known,
such as the well-investigated epithelial, neural, and placental
cadherins [11]. Cadherins play a crucial role in cell-cell
contacts, during embryonic organ development, but also
in the biology of several tumors. In addition, cadherins can
act as metastasis-suppressing proteins [12, 13]. N-cadherin
(CDH2) is a 140 kDa protein and was first identified in mouse
brain tissue [14]. It plays an important role in migration,
differentiation, embryonic development, and metastatic
behavior of tumor cells [15]. N-cadherin associates with the
actin-cytoskeleton through interactions with cytoplasmic
catenin proteins [16,17]. N-cadherin expression was observed
in neoplastic tissues of epithelial and mesenchymal origin
such as tumors of the lung, ovary, and kidney, but also in
different normal tissues [18–24]. We have previously shown
that N-cadherin shows a differential expression pattern in the
histological subtypes of GCTs [25].
In the present study, we used parental GCT cell
lines TCam-2, NCCIT and NTERA-2 and their cisplatinresistant sublines to further investigate the expression and

functional role of N-cadherin and as a model of cisplatin
resistance in GCT.

RESULTS
N-cadherin protein is expressed in cisplatinsensitive and resistant GCT-cell lines
In western blot analysis, N-cadherin protein
expression was found in all GCT-cell lines examined,
namely NCCIT, NTERA-2, and their cisplatin-resistant
sublines, as well as in TCam-2 cells. The expression was
considerably higher in TCam-2 cells than in NCCIT or
NTERA-2 (Figure 1A). No difference in N-cadherin
protein expression levels was detected between the two
cisplatin-sensitive and –resistant cell line pairs NCCIT/-R
and NTERA-2/-R (Figure 1B).

N-cadherin silencing in GCT cell lines by siRNA
The siRNA against CDH2 (siCDH2) efficiently
reduced N-cadherin expression in all investigated GCT
cell lines. The relative density of the western blot bands
was considerably reduced (Figure 1C+1D).

N-cadherin expression in mouse xenografts

Silencing of N-cadherin significantly reduces
proliferation in GCT cell lines irrespective of
cisplatin resistance

Xenografts of NCCIT (n = 4), NTERA-2 (n = 4)
and TCam-2 (n = 4) were investigated for expression of
N-cadherin protein. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded
tissues were investigated by immunohistochemistry
as described above. N-cadherin was expressed in the
cytoplasm and on the membrane of the tumor cells in
NCCIT (Figure 2A+2B), NTERA-2 (Figure 2C+2D),
and TCam-2-xenografts (Figure 2E+2F). Interestingly,
in xenografts, expression of N-cadherin was higher in
NTERA-2 and NCCIT, whereas the expression was lower
in TCam-2 xenografts, therefore showing an opposite
pattern to the expression results found by Western
Blotting (see above).

NCCIT/-R, NTERA-2/-R, and TCam-2 cell lines
were transfected with siRNA against CDH2 for 12 h,
24 h, 48 h, or 72 h, as described above. Proliferation
of NCCIT was significantly reduced after 12 h (p <
0.005), 24 h (p < 0.0005) and 48 h (p < 0.0005). After
72 h, no significant change in proliferation was observed
(Figure 4A). Proliferation of NCCIT-R was significantly
reduced after 12 h (p < 0.005), 24 h (p < 0.05), 48 h
(p < 0.0005) and 72 h (p < 0.005) (Figure 4B). In
NTERA-2, proliferation was significantly reduced after
48 h (p < 0.005) and 72 h (p < 0.005). After 12 h and
24 h (p < 0.005), no significant reduction of proliferation
was detectable (Figure 4C). In NTERA-2R, proliferation
was significantly reduced after 12 h (p < 0.005), 48 h
(p < 0.005) and 72 h (p < 0.0005). After 24 h, no significant
reduction of proliferation was detectable (Figure 4D). The
proliferation of TCam-2 was significantly reduced after
12 h (p < 0.05), 24 h (p < 0.005), 48 h (p < 0.0005) and
72 h (p < 0.0005) (Figure 4E).
In addition, NCCIT/-R, NTERA-2/-R, and TCam-2
cell lines were blocked with an anti-N-cadherin antibody
for 1 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. In NCCIT, the proliferation
was significantly reduced after 12 h (p < 0.0005), 24 h
(p < 0.0005) and 48 h (p < 0.005). After 1 h, no
significant reduction of proliferation was detectable
(Supplementary Figure S1A). Proliferation of NCCIT-R
was significantly reduced after 12 h (p < 0.05) and 48 h
(p < 0.05). After 1 h and 24 h no significant reduction of
proliferation was found (Supplementary Figure S1B). In

N-cadherin expression in metastasis of GCT
Metastases of 28 patients with a primary testicular
germ cell tumour were investigated for their expression
of N-cadherin protein. Table 1 gives an overview of the
different histological subtypes of investigated metastases.
All metastases of seminomas (n = 3, Figure 3A+3B) and
yolk sack tumours (n = 5, Figure 3C+3D) strongly expressed
N-cadherin. In all investigated metastases of mature
teratomas (n = 14), most areas were negative for N-cadherin.
Some areas with intestinal epithelium and neuronal tissue
show weak expression of N-cadherin. Neuroectodermal
tissues within mature teratomas (n = 4) showed strong
positivity for N-cadherin (Figure 3E–3H). Two metastases of
embryonal carcinomas did not express N-cadherin (Figures
not shown). An overview of investigated tumour types is
listed in Table1.

Invasiveness of GCT cell lines was investigated
after siRNA transfection for 48 h. NCCIT (p < 0.005),
NTERA-2 (p < 0.0005) and TCam-2 (p < 0.0005) tumor
cells showed significantly reduced invasiveness. After
treatment with a siRNA against CDH2 for 48 hours, the
invasiveness of cisplatin resistant cell lines NCCIT-R(p < 0.0005) and NTERA-2R- (p < 0.0005) cells was
significantly reduced (Figure 5F–5J).
In addition, migration of NCCIT (p < 0.05), NTERA-2
(p < 0.005) and TCam-2 (p < 0.0005) cells was significantly
reduced after blocking N-cadherin with a specific antibody
for 24 hours (Supplementary Figure S2A–S2C). Invasiveness
of NCCIT (p < 0.005), NTERA-2 (p < 0.005), and TCam2 (p < 0.0005) cells could be significantly inhibited by the
use of a specific antibody blocking N-cadherin for 24 hours
(Supplementary Figure S2D–S2F).

In a variety of normal tissues (e.g. neuronal,
endothelial and muscle cells) expression of N-cadherin has
been reported [27, 28]. Moreover, N-cadherin expression
has been described in several tumor entities, including
GCT. In the case of GCT, N-cadherin is expressed in
normal testis, precursor lesions, seminomas, and yolk
sack tumors. In contrast, no expression could be detected
in embryonic carcinomas and chorionic carcinomas
in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material [25].
Interestingly, GCT cell lines, some of them of embryonal
carcinoma origin, express N-cadherin in western blot
analysis, as shown in this study. In addition, we used
unfixated (fresh) tissue of embryonal carcinoma for
analysis of N-cadherin protein expression. The results
of western blot analysis demonstrate N-cadherin
expression, albeit at varying levels, in embryonal
carcinoma (Supplementary Figure S4). This difference in
N-cadherin expression might be attributable to changes
occurring during the fixation process. We used the two
representative embryonic carcinoma cell lines NCCIT/-R
and NTERA-2/-R as well as TCam-2 to investigate the role
of N-cadherin in GCT.
N-cadherin is able to induce cell survival, migration,
and invasion by modulating intracellular signaling
molecules. Altered N-cadherin expression has been
described during epithelial mesenchymal transformation
(EMT) [29]. The stem cell genes Oct-4 und Nanog, among
other, promote EMT in breast cancer stem cells. The coknockdown of Oct-4 and Nanog significantly reduced
the relative N-cadherin protein expression levels [30].
In GCT, reduced Oct-4 expression has been described
in cisplatin resistance [31], and Gutekunst et al. could
show that in GCTs Oct-4–dependent high constitutive
Noxa levels are required for cisplatin hypersensitivity
[32]. In contrast, we could not demonstrate differences in
N-cadherin expression when comparing cisplatin-sensitive
and resistant cell line pairs, suggesting that GCT might
show differences in pathways involved in EMT, compared
to other solid tumors. However, cross-talk of N-cadherin
with other membrane proteins activates signaling
cascades, thus influencing cell proliferation or invasion
[28]. N-cadherin blockade has been shown to lead to an
inhibition of cancer growth, metastasis formation, and
delay castration resistance in prostate cancer. In this
study, silencing of N-cadherin reduced activation of AKT
[33]. As shown in our investigations, downregulation of
N-cadherin reduces proliferation, migration and invasion
in parental and cisplatin-resistant GCT sublines in vitro.
The N-cadherin signaling pathway seems to be
variable. On the one hand, Li et al. described the role of
N-cadherin in melanoma cells. In this study, a knockdown
of N-cadherin with a blocking antibody leads to a significant
reduction of cell survival. However, in melanoma cells,
N-cadherin blocking inhibited Akt/PKB phosphorylation
[31]. It has also been shown that N-Cadherin decreases
osteoblast proliferation or survival by antagonizing Pi3K/

Downregulation of N-cadherin leads to
significant higher levels of pERK
Cisplatin-sensitive and resistant GCT cell lines were
investigated for pERK. The downregulation of N-cadherin
leads to a significant increase of pERK in NCCIT (p <
0.005), NCCIT-R (p < 0.0005), NTERA-2 (p < 0.0005),
NTERA-2R (p < 0,005), and TCam-2 (p < 0,005) cells
(Figure 6A–6E).

Downregulation of N-cadherin has no influence
on pAKT in cisplatin-sensitive and resistant
GCT cell lines
Cisplatin-sensitive and resistant GCT cell lines
were investigated for pAKT after transfection with
siRNA against N-cadherin. In the cell lines NCCIT,
NCCIT-R, and NTERA-2R, levels of pAKT showed no
differences after siRNA transfection. In addition, pAKT
was significantly decreased in NTERA-2 (p < 0.005)
and TCam-2 (p < 0.05) cells after siRNA transfection
(Supplementary Figure S3A–S3E).

Blocking N-cadherin induces apoptosis
GCT cell lines were treated with a blocking antibody
against N-cadherin. All cell lines showed a significant
increase of apoptotic cells in immunocytochemistry
analysis of Caspase-3 (NCCIT, NCCIT-R, NTERA-2,
NTERA-2R and TCam-2; p < 0.0005; Figure 7A–7E).

DISCUSSION
New treatment options for refractory TGCTs are
desperately needed. Recently, the mechanisms of cisplatin
resistance are beginning to emerge, and potential drug
targets have been described [26]. Nevertheless, new
therapeutic options and a better understanding of potential
mechanisms of resistance are needed.

AKT signaling [33]. S Chung et al. described the regulation
of mammary tumor cell migration by AKT3 suppression
through N-cadherin [32]. Our data suggest that blocking
N-cadherin in GCT cell lines leads to a significantly higher
level of p-ERK, whereas the activation of p-AKT does
not seem to play an important role in cisplatin-sensitive
and resistant GCT cells. Interestingly, an earlier analysis
demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, that there was
no clear pattern of Akt activation in non-seminomas
[34]. Nalla et al. could demonstrate that in prostate
cancer cells, the knockdown of N-cadherin increased
ERK phosphorylation [35]. This would be in line with
the data in our study. It could previously be shown that
cisplatin induces apoptosis in GCT cell lines through an
activation of the MEK–ERK signaling pathway. Schweyer
et al. showed that the activation of ERK culminated in
activation of the executor caspase-3 [36]. As shown in this
study, the inhibition of N-cadherin leads to significantly
reduced proliferation and higher levels of p-ERK.
By immunocytochemical analysis of GCT cell lines,
significantly increased levels of apoptosis in the caspase-3
staining could be detected following N-cadherin blockade.
Our data suggest that the underlying mechanism by which
the blockade of N-cadherin could reduce proliferation
may depend on activation of p-ERK. Xenografts of GCT
cell lines in nude mice showed N-cadherin expression in
all samples analysed. Therefore, xenografts of these cell
lines could be a valid cell model to investigate effects of
N-cadherin blockade in vivo. In summary, downregulation
or blocking of N-cadherin leads to a significant decrease
of proliferation, migration, and invasion in GCT cell
lines, irrespective of cisplatin resistance levels. The
inhibition of N-cadherin leads to activation of p-ERK,
and causes apoptosis. Thus, targeting N-cadherin may be
a promising therapeutic approach, particularly in cisplatinresistant GCT, where current options are limited. As
shown in this study, metastases of primary GCT express
N-cadherin. Interestingly, when comparing primary GCT
and metastases, no differences concerning N-cadherin
expression were detected. Since N-cadherin is expressed on
the cell surface, it could be a potential therapeutic target,
e.g. for therapeutic antibodies. A different approach is the
use of small molecules like ADH-1 (ExherinTM), which is an
N-cadherin antagonist cyclic pentapeptide. Clinical phase I
studies could show that ADH-1 was generally well tolerated
and showed evidence of anti-tumor activity in patients with
N-cadherin positive tumors, among others in refractory
solid tumors [37–39]. This may be a new therapeutic option,
especially in N-cadherin positive GCT.

Immunohistochemistry

Culture of GCT cell lines

Immunohistochemistry of N-cadherin was per­formed
on 4-μm formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue as
described previously [25]. Tumour tissues from metastases of
GCT specimens were acquired from the University Medical

Western blot analysis
Total protein lysates were prepared using RIPA
buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) and were quantified using the Bio-Rad DC
Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). For
western blot analysis, primary antibodies against anti-Ncadherin (polyclonal rabbit, sigma-aldrich, Taufkirchen,
Germany; dilution 1:1000, 4°C overnight) and anti-betaactin (monoclonal mouse, sigma-aldrich, dilution 1:5000,
room temperature 1 hour) were used. Primary antibodies
were detected by using anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Dako, Hamburg, Germany, dilution 1:1000). Membranes
were developed with the ECL system (Amersham
Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany).

Mouse tumor xenografts
Six-week-old male athymic nude (BALB/c-nu) mice
were purchased from Charles River Germany (Sulzfeld,
Germany). For acclimatization, mice were maintained
for 2 weeks in standard cages with air filter hoods, with
free access to food and water. Subsequently, all animals
received an s.c. inoculation of 1 × 106 exponentially
growing NTera-2, NCCIT and TCam-2 cells, resuspended
in 100 μL PBS mixed with 100 μL Matrigel (Becton
Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) on the dorsal
portion of the forelegs via a 26-gauge needle. Animals
were sacrificed after 60 days and tumors were excised.
Tumors were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and
embedded in paraffin. All experiments were performed
with approval by the local animal protection committee
(reference No. 33.11.42502-04-058/07).

human material in the present study was obtained from the
ethics committee of the University Medical Centre Göttingen.
Sections were stained using a Dako autostainer with the Dako
EnVision™ FLEX+ detection system (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark). The system detects primary mouse and rabbit
antibodies, and the reaction was visualized by EnVision™
FLEX DAB+ Chromogen. Using EnVision™ FLEX+ Mouse
(LINKER) or EnVision™ FLEX+ Rabbit (LINKER) (Code

(Dako). Tissue samples were analysed by light microscopy
after 8 min counterstaining with Meyer’s haematoxylin
(Dako). Two pathologists evaluated all tissue sections using
an immunoreactive staining score (IRS). The percentage
of positively stained cells was first categorized using a 0–4
scoring system: Score 0 = 0% positive cells, score 1 = less
than 10% positive cells, score 2 = 10–50% positive cells,
score 3 = 51–80% positive cells and score 4 = > 80% positive
cells. The intensity of staining was evaluated on a graded
scale (0 = negative; 1 = weak; 2 = intermediate; 3 = strong).
For the final IRS, the scores of intensity and staining were
multiplied and the mean value was calculated.

1 × 105 to 3 × 105 cells were plated as described
above. After 24 h incubation time, the culture medium was
exchanged for an antibody-medium (2 ml culture medium,
20 μl N-cadherin-antibody) or a siRNA-medium (2.3 ml
culture medium, 100 μl siRNA-Mix). Cells were dissolved
with trypsin. 50 μl cell suspension was supplemented with
450 μl proliferation kit. Cell proliferation was measured
with flow cytometry.

Migration assay
For in vitro cell migration, GCT cell lines were
treated with N-cadherin-blocking antibody or siRNA for
24 or 48 h. Subsequently, 7 × 104 cells were transferred
into the Millicell 8.0 μm hanging PET inserts (Millipore,
Billerica, MA) with 10% FCS. To create a gradient, the
medium in the culture plates contained 20% FCS. The cells
were incubated for 24 h as described above. Afterwards,
cells were counterstained with Meyer’s Haematoxylin
(Dako) for 2 min, and analyzed by light microscopy.

N-cadherin blocking antibody
Tumor cells were blocked with a monoclonal antiN-cadherin antibody produced in mouse (sigma-aldrich).
After 24 hours of incubation, the culture medium was
exchanged for the antibody mix with a concentration of
10 μg/ml. In addition, 10 μl antibody (IgG concentration
2–2.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 2ml culture medium. The
cells were incubated for 1 h, 12 h, 24 h, or 48 h.

Invasion assay
The in vitro cell invasion from TGCT cells was
determined using BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers
(BD Pharmingen™, San Diego, California, USA). Cells
were pre-treated with N-cadherin-blocking antibody
or siRNA for 24 or 48 hours. 70 000 cells were plated
in medium containing 10% FCS into the inserts. The
medium in the culture plates contained 20% FCS to create
a gradient. The cells were incubated for 48 h, fixed, and
counted microscopically.

siRNA transfection
Tumor cells were transfected with 100 μl anti
N-cadherin siRNA medium (12 μl Hiper feet, 2,5 μl
siRNA and 85,5 μl RPMI medium). siRNA used was
Hs_CDH2_6, cat. nr. SI02757335 (Quiagen, Hilden,
Germany). After incubation for 20 min, 100 μl siRNA
medium were mixed with 2.3ml culture medium to create a
concentration of 1:1000. The cells were incubated for 12 h,
24 h, 48 h, or 72 h respectively. Si-RNA aggradation in
the cells was measured by FACs-analysis with fluorescent
siRNA in the same concentration as described above.

MAPK activation dual detection kit
The Dual Detection kits each contain two directly
conjugated antibodies, a phospho specific antibody (PI3K:
phospho-specific anti-phospho-Akt (pAKT, Ser473) Alexa
Flour555; MAPK: phosphor-specific anti-phospho-ERK1/2
(pERK, Thr202/Tyr204, Thr185/typ187)-Phycoerythrin)
and a second antibody to measure the total levels of
either ERK or Akt (PI3K: anti-Akt, PECy5 conjugated;
MAPK: anti-ERK1/2-PECy5 conjugated). Each kit allows

Immunocytochemistry
Tumor cells were treated as described above and
subsequently transfered onto slides using cytospin at
1000 rpm for 10 minutes. The slides were allowed to dry

measuring of the phosphorylated level against the total
amount of expression. Cells were plated in a 6-Well
Plate with 300,000 Cells per well and simultaneously
transfected with siRNA against N-Cadherin (as described
above). After 48 h of treatment the cells were trypsinized
and the cell number was determined using the MUSE Cell
Count&Viability Kit (Merck Millipore). The volumes used
in the cell preparation were dependent of the measured
cell number. Cells were prepared and treated according to
the MUSE Dual Detection Kit Protocol as described by
the manufacturer. Cells were fixed on ice for 5 minutes
after adding 500 μl Assay Buffer per one million cells
and 500 μl Fixation Solution. After a washing step the
permebilization is carried out on ice for 5 minutes as well
by resuspending cells in 1ml cold permeabilization buffer
per one million cells. Cells were washed again with assay
buffer and resuspended in 450 μl assay buffer per one
million cells and aliquoted à 90 μl. For staining with both
antibodies, 10μ of a previously prepared antibody-cocktail
is added to the cell suspension. After 30 minutes incubation
in the dark, followed by a washing step with assay buffer
to remove the remaining antibodies, the stained cells are
resuspended in 200 μl assay buffer. To adjust the settings
exactly for every cell line, a sample stained with 5 μl of
only the one antibody to measure the total amount of the
desired protein is prepared. The settings for each sample
are adjusted with its own total expression. By doing so, the
sample stained with both antibodies will show precisely
the ratio between the total and the phosphorylated amount.

Assessment of apoptotic cells
The cultured and treated cells (as described above)
were spun down onto slides at 1000rpm for 10 minutes.
The slides were allowed to dry overnight. After fixation
with formalin for 15 minutes, the slides were rinsed with
PBS. The cells were permeabilized using PBS with 0,25%
Triton X-100 for 5 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase was
blocked with 3%H2O2 for 5 minutes. Caspase3-Antibody
was applied afterwards (cleaved Caspase 3, 1/50, Zytomed
Systems RBK009-05) for 1 hour. The secondary antibody
(anti mouse/rabbit, labelled with HRP) was incubated for
25 minutes and the chromogen (DAB) for 5 minutes (Dako
REAL EnVision Detection System, DAKO). Samples were
counterstained with Meyer’s Haematoxylin and coverslipped.
