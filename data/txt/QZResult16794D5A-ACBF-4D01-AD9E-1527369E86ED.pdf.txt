Abstract
We have previously described a small interfering RNA (siRNA)
delivery system (AtuPLEX) for RNA interference (RNAi) in the
vasculature of mice. Here we report preclinical data for
Atu027, a siRNA-lipoplex directed against protein kinase N3
(PKN3), currently under development for the treatment of
advanced solid cancer. In vitro studies revealed that Atu027mediated inhibition of PKN3 function in primary endothelial
cells impaired tube formation on extracellular matrix and
cell migration, but is not essential for proliferation. Systemic
administration of Atu027 by repeated bolus injections or
infusions in mice, rats, and nonhuman primates results in
specific, RNAi-mediated silencing of PKN3 expression. We
show the efficacy of Atu027 in orthotopic mouse models for
prostate and pancreatic cancers with significant inhibition
of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis formation. The
tumor vasculature of Atu027-treated animals showed a specific
reduction in lymph vessel density but no significant changes in
microvascular density. [Cancer Res 2008;68(23):9788–98]

Introduction
RNA interference (RNAi) can be used as novel therapeutic
modality through specific silencing of therapeutically relevant
genes in vivo (1–3). In particular, chemically synthesized, small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) are currently used as a new class of
therapeutic molecules, allowing the controlled down-regulation of
pathologically relevant gene expression as for oncogenes in cancer
(4). However, in analogy to classic antisense molecules the in vivo
application of these molecules is not straightforward. The overall
negative charge of siRNA molecules (up to 40 negative charges) and
the relatively high molecular weight (12,000–14,000 Da) prevent
these from functional uptake of these novel therapeutic molecules
in vivo. Besides the inefficient uptake and the degradation in
endosomal compartments on the cellular level, unformulated
siRNAs are rapidly cleared by renal excretion from the blood
stream when administered i.v. (5).
To overcome these limitations, delivery technologies for
synthetic siRNAs are currently being developed, enabling the use

of chemically synthesized siRNA for therapeutic purposes (for a
technology review, see refs. 2, 4, 6–8). With respect to cancer, a
variety of nonviral nanoparticles (50–200 nm) have been recently
reported to be suitable for RNAi-mediated tumor growth inhibition
in experimental mouse models (summarized in ref. 6). In most
cases, various siRNA carriers such as cyclodextrin (transferrin
receptor targeted; ref. 9), PEI (RGD-targeted PEG-PEI; ref. 10),
DOTAP (self-assembled LPD-nanoparticle; nanosized immunoliposome; refs. 11, 12), AtuFECT (AtuPLEX; refs. 5, 13), or other cationic
lipids (14–17) have been developed for efficient complexation and
delivery of siRNAs. The addition of targeting ligands (transferrin,
anisamide, RGD-peptide, poly-arginine, anti-TfR single-chain antibody fragment/TfRscFv, DNA) and additional lipid moieties
(PEG-lipids, cholesterol, endosomolytic helper lipids, or peptides)
or the overall morphology of the generated nanoparticles
(characterized by charge and particle size) supposedly confer
targeting specificity to either cancer cells and/or tumor vasculature. Likewise, siRNAs targeting the expression of oncogenes
(EphA2, EWS-Fli-1, Raf-kinase, EGFR/Her2) or angiogenesis-promoting genes (VEGFR2 and CD31) were chosen for RNAi-mediated
therapeutic intervention in oncology.
It remains debatable by which mechanism siRNA-containing
nanoparticles (>60 nm) can escape the circulation and cross the
endothelial barrier to efficiently penetrate the tumor tissue.
However, in contrast to other organ parenchyma, the vascular
bed (endothelial cells) is directly accessible for systemically
administered particles and therefore predestinated to endocytosis
of siRNA-loaded particles, offering the reasonable approach for
RNAi-based therapeutic modulation of the vasculature. Hence, an
antiangiogenic approach by means of ‘‘formulated siRNA-inhibitor’’ targeting the tumor vascular compartment might bear
valuable strategic and therapeutic advantages.
We recently described a novel liposomal siRNA formulation
based on cationic lipids (siRNA-lipoplex/AtuPLEX), containing
neutral fusogenic and PEG-modified lipid components, for
improved pharmacokinetic properties, cellular uptake, and efficient siRNA release from the endosomes after endocytosis. Using
this formulation, we have shown a selective inhibition of gene
expression in endothelial cells in vivo as shown by target-specific
knockdown of CD31 [platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1
(PECAM-1)] or TIE-2 in various mouse tissues (5, 18). Moreover, we
showed therapeutic efficacy in xenograft mouse tumor models
after systemic administration of CD31 targeting siRNA-lipoplexes
(13). The observed efficacy was not related to toxic side effects
including unspecific stimulation of the innate immune system.
Repeated dosing of the AtuPLEX does not elevate systemic levels

of cytokines such as IFN-a or interleukin (IL)-12 (5, 13). These
results laid the foundation for the preclinical development of this
novel liposomal siRNA formulation for RNAi therapeutics in
oncology.
Here we discuss preclinical data on Atu027, a lipoplexed siRNA
molecule specifically targeting the expression of protein kinase N3
(PKN3). PKN3 has previously been identified as a downstream
effector of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway
(19). Loss of PKN3 function in vascular and lymphatic endothelial
cells by RNAi suggested PKN3 as an appropriate molecular target
for an antiangiogenesis therapeutic strategy. We show the therapeutic potential of Atu027 for tumor treatment in orthotopic mouse
tumor models along with PKN3 gene silencing in vivo. Furthermore,
we noticed changes in the tumor lymphatic vasculature on
Atu027 treatment, suggesting an anti-lymphangiogenesis mode of
action for the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis.

Materials and Methods
siRNA molecules and preparation of siRNA-lipoplexes. siRNA
molecules (AtuRNAi, blunt-ended 23-mer, alternating 2¶-O-methyl modified)
were previously described (20) and were synthesized by BioSpring. To
screen for PKN3 mRNA inhibition, eight different mouse and human
specific siRNA molecules were designed by bioinformatics means with the
human/mouse-specific PKN3(3) lead siRNA sequence, sense strand 1552agacuugaggacuuccuggacaa-1574 (NM_013355.3); for the rat studies, a rat
specific sequence was used, sense strand 5¶-aagcuugaggaauuccuugacaa-3¶
(XM_216019); the Luciferase specific sequence, sense strand 5¶-aucacguacgcggaauacuucga-3¶, was used as control. Complete sequence homology
between the PKN3(3) siRNA sequence and the corresponding cynomolgus
PKN3 mRNA was confirmed by cloning and sequencing of the
corresponding cynomolgus cDNA derived from two different tissues (data
not shown). A list of the siRNA sequences used in this study is shown in

Supplementary Table S1. All AtuPLEXes (siRNA-lipoplexes) were prepared
as described previously (5). The physicochemical properties of Atu027
particles are summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1.
In vitro transfection, immunoblotting, and functional assays. The
siRNA-lipoplex containing 0.28 mg/mL siRNA (19 Amol/L) was further
diluted to a final concentration of 1 to 20 nmol/L siRNA in 10% serum–
containing cell culture medium. Human HeLa, PC-3, and murine EOMA cell
lines were obtained and cultivated according to the American Type Culture
Collection recommendation. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
(HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial lung lymphatic cells
(HMVEC-LLy) were obtained from Lonza.
The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: rabbit antiPTEN (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-PKN3 (19), mouse anti–Hsp60 (BD
Laboratories), rabbit anti–Akt-1 (Cell Signaling), and mouse anti-tubulin
(Oncogene). For the Matrigel assay, HUVEC and HMVEC-LLy cells were
trypsinized 72 h posttransfection, counted, and seeded on Matrigel
basement membrane matrix (Becton Dickinson) with a seeding density of
100,000 per 24-well plate. At the same time point, cells were lysed for
Western blotting to measure PKN3 protein expression. Photographs were
taken after 6 h to evaluate tube formation. In the transmigration (Boyden
chamber) assay, HUVEC cells were trypsinized 72 h posttransfection,
counted, and seeded onto Fluoroblok inserts in serum-free medium. Bottom
wells were filled with serum- and growth factor–containing medium as
chemoattractant. At the same time point, cells were lysed for Western
blotting to show PKN3 knockdown. After 6 h, migrated cells were visualized
by staining with SYTOX Green (Molecular Probes), and photographs were
taken to determine cell number. HUVEC cells were seeded for the scratch
assay onto 24-well plates at 200,000 per well 48 h after transfection with
siRNA-lipoplexes. The next day, confluent monolayers were scratched and
photographs were taken at 0, 3, and 6 h after scratching. In parallel, wholecell lysates were generated for subsequent immunoblotting.

Eight-week-old male NMRI-nu/nu mice (Harlan) and female nonobese
diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice (Charles River) were used

Results
Atu027-mediated PKN3 inhibition and in vitro loss-offunction analysis in endothelial cells. PKN3 is a downstream
effector of the PI3K/PTEN signal transduction pathway (19). Here
we set out to analyze the biological/physiologic consequences of
PKN3 inhibition in cultured vascular endothelial cells and
lymphatic endothelial cells. First, we screened target-specific,
blunt-ended, nuclease-stabilized (alternating 2¶-O-methyl modified)
siRNA molecules (AtuRNAi; ref. 20) targeting PKN3 expression in
respective cell lines. For both the in vitro and the subsequent
in vivo applications, we used the previously described and
characterized siRNA-lipoplex formulations (AtuPLEX; for a detailed
description, see ref. 5). Five of eight siRNA molecules (AtuRNAi; see
Materials and Methods) showed a marked decrease in PKN3
protein expression 48 h posttransfection (Fig. 1A) in HeLa cells and
two vascular endothelial cell lines, HUVEC along with EOMA
(mouse hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells). A titration of the
lipoplexed siRNAPKN3(3) lead sequence, hereafter named Atu027,
revealed an IC50 of f5 nmol/L (concentration for siRNA) in HeLa,
HUVEC, and HMVEC-LLy (Fig. 1B).
HUVEC and HMVEC-LLy were treated with Atu027/siRNAPKN3(3)-lipoplex, another potent siRNAPKN3(5)-lipoplex, and two
negative siRNA-lipoplexes [siRNAPKN3(1) and siRNAPKN3(4)] or
control siRNALuc-lipoplex. The cells were seeded on extracellular
matrix 48 h posttransfection and analyzed (Fig. 1C and D). RNAimediated reduction of PKN3 expression in HUVEC and HMVECLLy clearly impaired formation of the typical network-like
structures on Matrigel as observed for untreated or siRNALuclipoplex–treated cells, suggesting PKN3 function in migration to be
required for the formation of endothelial cell tube–like structures.
To further analyze PKN3 participation in cell migration, we
examined HUVEC cells by transmigration assay (Boyden Chamber
assay) and observed a marked decrease in transmigrated cells with
reduced PKN3 expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A). This migration
phenotype was confirmed in a scratch assay with HUVEC cells
treated with Atu027 (siRNA PKN3(3) -lipoplex; Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Cells depleted of PKN3 (Supplementary Fig. S2B) showed
impaired migration into scratch wounds as compared with controls.
To rule out any inhibition of cell proliferation as a direct
consequence of PKN3 loss-of-function phenotype in this assay, we
analyzed cell growth on plastic dishes after Atu027/siRNAPKN3(3)-

lipoplex treatment. PKN3 silencing did not lead to a significant
change in the proliferation status of endothelial HUVEC and
HMVEC-LLy as well as cancerous HeLa and PC-3 cells (data not
shown) when compared with untreated or control siRNALuclipoplex–treated cells (Fig. 2A and B). Interestingly, PKN3 gene
silencing shown by Western blot was maintained up to 144 h in
rapidly proliferating HUVEC and HMVEC-LLy after a single Atu027
transfection (Fig. 2A and B, right ). Taken together, Atu027
[siRNAPKN3(3)-lipoplex] target-specifically inhibits PKN3 gene expression, and PKN3 seems to be dispensable for normal cell
proliferation but rather plays a role in cell migration and/or
adhesion processes required for endothelial tube formation on
extracellular matrix. To shed some light on the molecular
mechanism of PKN3 signaling in response to vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF)-A, we analyzed the phosphorylation status
of diverse direct effectors of VEGF-R2 such as PI3K/Akt and
phospholipase Cg/endothelial nitric oxide synthase after VEGF-A
stimulation in nontransfected as well as siRNALuc- and siRNAPKN3(3)transfected HUVEC. No substantial differences in phophorylation
levels were observed in PKN3-depleted and control HUVEC for these
known effectors implicated in VEGF-A–mediated pathologic
angiogenic neovascularization (refs. 25, 26; Supplementary Fig. S3),
and no phosphorylation target could be identified thus far.
Atu027-mediated RNAi in vivo. Systemic administration of
Atu027 resulted in suppression of PKN3 expression in vivo when
applied as bolus in mice or after (4 hours) infusion in mice, rats,
and nonhuman primates. PKN3 mRNA expression was analyzed in
different organs by quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) after repeated
bolus administration of Atu027, control siRNA-lipoplex, and
sucrose solution. The PKN3 mRNA reduction was most robust in
lung and liver tissues (Fig. 3A) and moderate in tumor tissues, but
not apparent in heart and spleen. Importantly, we have previously
shown that systemic administration of siRNA-lipoplexes (AtuPLEX)
led preferentially to RNAi in the mouse vasculature (5, 13). The
moderate PKN3 mRNA reduction observed for s.c. (DU-145) and
orthotopic (PC-3) prostate tumor xenografts might reflect the
PKN3 expression in nontargeted tumor cancer cells, which cannot
be reached with systemic AtuPLEX administration. In other words,
target mRNA reduction can be detected in whole highly
vascularized tissue lysates or even if target gene expression is
either restricted to or up-regulated in endothelial cells. Therefore, it
is not surprising that Atu027-mediated inhibition of PKN3 mRNA
expression, which is not restricted to endothelial cells, can be
shown most significantly in the highly vascularized lung.
Furthermore, we analyzed the gene silencing activity of Atu027
given at different doses in mice and rats by repeated daily i.v.
infusions (20 mL/kg body weight in 4 hours). In mice, four repeated
daily doses of 1.4 and 0.7 mg/kg Atu027 gave rise to a dosedependent significant mRNA reduction in the lung, whereas in the
liver 1.4 mg/kg showed the highest efficacy. Two low doses,
0.35 and 0.18 mg/kg, did not show PKN3 mRNA reduction in any
organ at all (Fig. 3B). We also monitored the siRNA levels in mouse
plasma during the 4-h infusion twice (at 30 minutes and 3 h 50
minutes) and also 6 and 20 h postinfusion, using a modified
capture probe assay (see Material and Methods; Fig. 3B, bottom).
Notably, peak plasma concentrations were f10 nmol/L during
infusion of the effective doses (1.4 and 0.7 mg/kg) and, therefore,
higher than the in vitro determined IC50 of f5 nmol/L.
We performed the same study with rats, using a formulated
homologous rat PKN3 targeting siRNA (four nucleotide changes in
the 23-mer sequence). In rat, we observed PKN3 mRNA reduction

served as loading controls. A branched-chain DNA
(b-DNA ) assay was carried out for showing dosedependent PKN3 knockdown in Cynomolgus lung tissue
(C, right, middle row ). During infusion, the siRNA plasma
concentrations for the indicated doses were determined
for both strands (day 4 postinfusion in mice; B ) or for the
antisense strand on day 1 and day 29 postinfusion

in the lung and some modest target gene suppression in the liver at
the highest dose (2.8 mg/kg), but not at lower doses as seen before
(Supplementary Fig. S4, compare with 3B). Therefore, the required
effective dose seems to be higher in rats, even though the
pharmacokinetic profile for the siRNA levels in rat plasma seemed
to be very similar to the one observed in mouse plasma
(Supplementary Fig. S4, bottom).
Finally, we conducted a dose range finding study for assessing
RNAi in vivo efficacy in nonhuman primates (Cynomolgus

repeated 4-h i.v. infusions of Atu027 at doses of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg
siRNA/kg every 4th day. Additionally, control animals were treated
in parallel with a 270 mmol/L sucrose carrier solution. Importantly,
in vivo gene silencing of PKN3 was observed when compared with
sucrose-treated animals for all three different doses on mRNA and
protein levels in monkey lung tissue samples harvested 24 h after
the last administration on day 29 (Fig. 3C; PKN3 protein: top right;

mRNA normalized to ubiquitously expressed p110a mRNA). For
determination of the lowest RNAi-active dose, a second study in
Cynomolgus was carried out including two additional lower doses
at 0.03 and 0.1 mg siRNA/kg. Notably, dose-dependent silencing of
PKN3 expression was observed, revealing 0.3 mg/kg siRNA as the
minimal active dose in monkey (Fig. 3C, b-DNA).
Bioanalytic examination was done with whole blood from these
monkey specimens for recording siRNA plasma concentrations at
different time points during infusion on day 1 and day 29 to
determine possible changes in siRNA plasma clearance after
repeated dosing. The lipoplexed siRNA plasma profiles for the
infusion on day 1 and day 29 were similar for all five tested doses,
indicating that a repeated dosing is feasible (Fig. 3C, bottom).
Interestingly, the siRNA plasma concentrations in monkeys were
significantly higher when compared with the plasma siRNA
concentrations with similar doses administered to rodents
(compare bottom graphs of Fig. 3B and C; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Tumor growth inhibition and reduction of lymph node
metastasis by systemic administration of Atu027. Having shown
RNAi in vivo activity of Atu027 in three different species, we
investigated the pharmacologic activity in tumor mouse models.
Metastases are responsible for the majority (f90%) of deaths
associated with solid tumors (27). Therefore, one major objective in
the treatment of solid cancer in humans is the prevention and
inhibition of invasive tumor growth and metastasis. To test
whether Atu027 has therapeutic potential in the prevention of
invasive tumor growth and metastasis, we used an orthotopic
prostate cancer (PC-3) model (19, 21). This model has the
advantage of analyzing both PC-3 prostate tumor growth and
assessment of metastatic spread of cancer cells into adjacent
lymph nodes. PC-3 cells were transplanted intraprostatically into
nude mice, and animals (n = 8 per group) were treated as indicated

www.aacrjournals.org

with sucrose solution, Atu027, or control siRNALuc-lipoplex after
tumor establishment with eight consecutive bolus injections every
other day at a given dose (Fig. 4A). Notably, we did not observe
significant treatment-related changes in body weight in this
experiment (Fig. 4A, top right). Tumor volumes and lymph node
metastasis volumes and numbers were determined for one group
before treatment (pretreatment control group; day 35) to define
tumor progression during the treatment period. Regarding
therapeutic efficacy, mean tumor and lymph node metastasis
volumes further increased in the sucrose- and siRNALuc-treated
control group, whereas Atu027/siRNAPKN3(3)-lipoplex treatment
restrained further tumor growth and, more importantly, the
formation of lymph node metastases (Fig. 4B).
To show target-specific gene silencing in Atu027-treated mice,
we determined the PKN3 mRNA level in lung tissue extracts 24 h
after last treatment by TaqMan-PCR. Down-regulation of PKN3
mRNA in individual mice was detected in comparison with the
control siRNALuc-lipoplex–treated mice (Fig. 4C). However, we were
not able to show a direct reduction of PKN3 target mRNA in tumor
lysates, most probably due to the cell type heterogeneity within the
tissue samples and/or the low expression levels of mouse PKN3
mRNA in these low vascularized prostate tumors (data not shown).
The therapeutic efficacy and pharmacologic activity of Atu027
were further proved in a study on PC-3 tumor inhibition using
a different treatment schedule (15 i.v. injections every 4th day
beginning treatment at day 7) at lower doses compared with the
2.8 mg/kg siRNA dose used before (Fig. 5A). Repeated dosing every
4th day at 1.4 or 0.7 mg/kg, but not 0.3 mg/kg, siRNA resulted in
a significant inhibition of further tumor growth and lymph node
metastasis formation (Fig. 5B). At the same time, no signs of
toxicity or other adverse effects were observed over the entire
treatment period, as indicated by the maintenance of stable
bodyweight (Fig. 5A, right).

Furthermore, Atu027 was applied in additional mouse tumor
models including experimental lung metastasis models (i.v.
injection of Lewis lung cancer cells and murine B-16V melanoma
cells) and two different orthotopic pancreatic tumor models,
supporting the shown therapeutic efficacy (as summarized in
Supplementary Table S2). The broad therapeutic effect in these
different models is consistent with the hypothesis that Atu027
mediates PKN3 gene silencing in the mouse vasculature and might
interfere directly with angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, or metastasis processes.
Atu027 reduces the lymphatic vessel density, but not
microvessel density, in two different mouse models. We set
out to determine whether PKN3 inhibition affects neoangiogenic
processes during tumor progression and metastasis. Our previous
studies with fluorescently labeled siRNA molecules indicated that
tumor vasculature is the preferred cellular target structure within

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

tumors. Analysis of microvasculature density (MVD) or the
formation of lymph vessel structures [lymph vessel density
(LVD)] in tumor sections from animals treated with Atu027 was
carried out by staining with vessel specific markers such as antiCD34 or anti-CD31 (vasculature) and LYVE-1 (lymphatics). We used
two different orthotopic tumor models, a PC-3 prostate cancer or a
DanG pancreatic cancer model, treated with the same daily dose
of 2.8 mg/kg Atu027, but with different treatment schedules,
depending on the tumor model (Fig. 6A and C). A qualitative and
quantitative determination of MVD using a CD34-specific (Fig. 6B)
or CD31-specific (Fig. 6D) antibody did not reveal a significant
difference between Atu027-treated and sucrose-control animals
(Fig. 6B and D, top) in the number of blood vessels. In contrast,
analysis of LVD in corresponding sections of respective treatment
groups revealed a significant reduction of lymphatic vessels in
tumor sections of the Atu027-treated animals (Fig. 6B and D,

bottom). Although reduction of MVD was not detectable in these
particular tumors, we currently cannot rule out a functional
impairment of tumor blood vessels.

Discussion
There is an unmet medical need for effective cancer therapies
that block the progression of solid tumors and prevent the
formation of metastasis. PKN3 has been validated as a
therapeutic target in cancer cells downstream of PI3K signaling.
For example, induced inhibition of PKN3 in PTEN / prostate
cancer cells (PC-3) led to a reduced number of lymph node
metastases in orthotopic prostate cancer models (19). In many
human sporadic cancers, the PI3K pathway is chronically
activated by loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN (28). In
endothelial cells, PI3K can be activated by a wide range of
vascular growth factors [e.g., VEGF, angiopoietins, basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor-B, ephrin-B2,
and transforming growth factor-h superfamily members] or in
conjunction with shear stress leading to activation of neovascularization (including tumor angiogenesis; ref. 29). Moreover,
a recent publication suggested also a direct function of PI3K in
the control of endothelial cell migration during tumor angiogenesis (30). We therefore rationalized that RNAi-mediated gene
silencing of PKN3, as a downstream effector of PI3K, in the
vasculature of mice may result in inhibition of PI3K-dependent
tumoral hemangiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis. To support
this hypothesis, we validated the PKN3 loss-of-function phenotype
in primary HUVEC (vascular endothelial) and HMVEC-LLy
(lymph-endothelial) cell culture systems. PKN3 function seemed

to be essential for cell migration and adhesion-dependent
formation of network/tube-like structures on Matrigel in both
endothelial cell types. However, loss of PKN3 function did not
significantly affect HUVEC or HMVEC-LLy cell proliferation. From
these data, we reasoned that systemic RNAi-mediated PKN3
inhibition might prevent new vessel/endothelial cells from
forming appropriate vessel structures without inhibiting the
proliferation capacity, reducing the likelihood of target-related
toxic side effects caused by PKN3 inhibition in other cell types.
The liposomal siRNA formulation used here (AtuPLEX) has
been designed for systemic administration of siRNAs to treat
advanced solid cancers (5, 13). Consistent with our previous studies
on AtuPLEX-mediated siRNACD31 delivery, here we showed that
systemic Atu027 administration resulted in therapeutic efficacy in
several tumor mouse models. The therapeutic effect is in particular
pronounced in the inhibition of lymph node metastasis (PC-3
model) and invasive growth (see Supplementary Table S2; data not
shown). In parallel, we succeeded to show Atu027-mediated RNAi
in vivo after systemic administration of siRNA by measuring target
mRNA quantity in the surrogate lung tissue from three different
species. Because PKN3 is also highly expressed in nontargeted cells
of the primary tumor, reduction in PKN3 expression within the
tumor endothelial cells cannot be easily detected without
enrichment of this particular cellular entity.
Tumor angiogenesis, the new generation or modulation of tumor
vessels, has been recognized as a hallmark step during carcinogenesis, promoting tumor metastasis (31–33). In view of this,
vascularized human tumors such as non–small-cell lung cancer
have been found to metastasize early in carcinogenesis to regional
lymph nodes, correlating with the degree of lymphangiogenesis

(34, 35). Additionally, in humans, tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis correlates with lymph node metastasis and prognosis of
several tumor entities (36, 37). Our data on Atu027 implicate a
function in controlling lymphatic vessel growth, making an antilymphangiogenic cancer therapy conceivable. Lymphangiogesis is
currently being considered as an attractive alternative strategy for
preventing metastasis (as shown for targeting NRP2; ref. 38). It is
suggestive that our observed reduction in LVD, owing to Atu027
treatment, may be the main reason for the reduced metastatic
spread of PC-3 cells into regional lymph nodes (Fig. 4B and 5B).
At the same time, MVD seemed to be unchanged after Atu027

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

treatment, which does not ultimately indicate for a missing
contribution of the vasculature on tumor progression. The lack of
changes in MVD at the end of treatment might reflect that existing
mature blood vessels were not disrupted, but additional neoangiogenic processes became blocked during treatment leading to
smaller tumors. To clarify this issue, tumors needed to be harvested
from control and Atu027-treated animals at early and late time
points. Interestingly, in contrast to Atu027, systemic treatment of
mice with bevacizumab, a VEGF neutralizing monoclonal antibody
(for summary, see ref. 39), clearly resulted in blocked tumor vessel
growth and, consequently, reduced MVD at the end of treatment in

our xenograft models (data not shown). Notably, even induction
of excessive angiogenesis after Dll4 inhibition was suggested to
block tumor growth, contrasting the classic antivascular/
antiangiogenesis concept (i.e., MVD reduction) for effective
anticancer therapy (40). Finally, the vessel normalization rather
than the disruption of tumor vasculature has been implied to
provide antiangiogenic therapy benefits (41). Additional systemic
effects of Atu027 treatment and PKN3 inhibition, such as direct
obstruction of circulating and/or disseminated tumor cells as
well as endothelial progenitor cells, macrophages, or other bone
marrow–derived cells, can be proposed as contributing to the
onset of metastasis (42–44). However, we have no direct
evidence of RNAi-mediated inhibition of PKN3 in these
particular cell types thus far. Finally, it should be noted that
liposomal formulation of a different potent PKN3 siRNA
(Supplementary Fig. S5A; siRNAPKN3(71)) had a similar antitumor
effect, as shown in another prostate cancer xenograft (LNCaP;
Supplementary Fig. S5), supporting the proposed therapeutic
PKN3 loss-of-function effect.
A sequence and target-independent TLR-mediated antiangiogenesis effect after local injection (intravitreal) of naked siRNAs
has been proposed recently (45). However, we have no evidence for
TLR activation with formulated (AtuPLEX), 2¶-O-methyl modified,
23-mer, and blunt-ended siRNAs in vitro and after repeated
systemic administration in mice (Supplementary Fig. S6). Beyond
the already published data (5, 13) on lack of IL-12p40 and IFN-a
stimulation, we expanded the panel of analyzed cytokines by IL-6,
IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor a. Again, no stimulation was
observed after systemic administration of Atu027 or an unrelated
siRNALuc-AtuPLEX (Supplementary Fig. S6). Nevertheless, we have
addressed the question on possible changes in levels of Kleinman
and colleagues’ (45) proposed ‘‘antiangiogenic acting’’ cytokines
IL-12 and IFN-g in our in vitro and in vivo settings (Supplementary

Fig. S6, and data not shown). Neither naked nor lipoplexed PKN3
siRNA or unrelated siRNA carrying the 2¶-O-methyl-modification
(20) showed any significant increase in the levels of these particular
cytokines after single and repeated dosing, supporting our initial
results. The 2¶-O-methyl modified 23-mer siRNA most likely can
abolish any immunostimulatory effects, as suggested by other
published reports (45–47). Therefore, it seems unlikely that TLR
activation contributes to our observed tumor efficacy, supporting
an RNAi dependent, target-specific mode of action of Atu027.
In conclusion, this study supports the further development of
Atu027 as a novel siRNA formulation, targeting PKN3 expression to
impede progression of multiple solid cancers, including pancreatic
and prostate cancer. Currently, Atu027 is being evaluated in toxicity
studies in nonhuman primates for upcoming clinical trials.
