Abstract

Author Manuscript

A well-studied RNA-binding protein Hu Antigen-R (HuR), controls post-transcriptional gene
regulation and undergoes stress-activated caspase-3 dependent cleavage in cancer cells. The
cleavage products of HuR are known to promote cell death however, the underlying molecular
mechanisms facilitating caspase-3 activation and HuR cleavage remains unknown. Here, we show
that HuR cleavage associated with active caspase-3 in oral cancer cells treated with ionizing
radiation and chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel. We determined that oral cancer cells
overexpressing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) limited the cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR, which
reduced the rate of cell death in paclitaxel resistant oral cancer cells. Specific inhibition of COX-2
by celecoxib, promoted apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of HuR in
paclitaxel-resistant oral cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, oral cancer cells
overexpressing cellular HuR increased the half-life of COX-2 mRNA, promoted COX-2 protein
expression and exhibited enhanced tumor growth in vivo in comparison with cells expressing a
cleavable form of HuR. Finally, our ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation and sequencing (RIP-

seq) analyses of HuR in oral cancer cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR), determined that HuR
cleavage product-1 (HuR-CP1) bound and promoted the expression of mRNAs encoding proteins
involved in apoptosis. Our results indicated that, cellular non-cleavable HuR controls COX-2
mRNA expression and enzymatic activity. In addition, overexpressed COX-2 protein repressed the
cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR to promote drug resistance and tumor growth. Altogether, our
observations support the use of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, in combination with paclitaxel, for
the management of paclitaxel resistant oral cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Understanding gene expression patterns in response to chemoradiotherapy is crucial to the
successful treatment of cancer. Recent emerging technologies permitted the development of
targeted therapies for a variety of cancers1. However, most of these therapies target DNA
transcription initiation factors or signaling kinases. Interestingly, studies demonstrated that
during chemotherapy, post-transcriptional control of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability/
turnover is altered, this alteration offers a promising target for the development of new
therapeutics2. For instance, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) thought to be involved in
controlling the expression of mRNAs that encode proteins responsible for cell death,
consequently altering treatment efficacy in cancer3–5. RBP-mediated cell death is considered
an additional checkpoint for cancer treatment. However, a mechanistic link between RBPmediated halting of cancer cell growth and efficacy of treatment has not been thoroughly
studied.
Human antigen R (HuR), belongs to the family of ELAV (embryonic lethal, abnormal
vision) proteins, known to regulate cellular development and immune functions6, 7. In
cancer, HuR regulates the mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, apoptosis and cell migration8. Although HuR is an extensively studied RBP,
HuR mediated control of apoptosis in cancer is poorly understood. Under lethal cellular
stress like hypoxia or ionizing radiation, caspase-3 cleaves HuR and the resulting HuR
cleavage products promote cell death9–11.

Author Manuscript

The cellular apoptotic response is controlled by the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway, depending
on the stress response. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by disruption of the mitochondrial
membrane potential by Bcl protein family members and dysregulation of this pathway
induces cancer12. In the extrinsic pathway, extracellular death ligands like Fas L13 bind to
cell-surface receptors stimulating caspase-8 cleavage and subsequently caspase-3 activation.
Caspases are inhibited by several proteins involved in cell proliferation14. For example,
cyclooxygenases (COX), also known as prostaglandin G/H synthases, enzymatically convert
arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxane A2. There are two known isoforms of
COX enzymes: COX-1 (alias PTGS1) and COX-2 (alias PTGS2)15. COX-2 is overexpressed
in several cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma16–22. Interestingly, overexpressed

COX-2 blocked caspase-3 activation, and subsequent inhibition of COX-2 activity by
celecoxib induced apoptosis23. HuR is known to control the expression of COX-2 mRNA in
multiple cancers through interaction with AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated
region24–27. Although these observations support that HuR controls COX-2 expression in
cancer, the molecular mechanism of HuR-mediated COX-2 promotion of tumor growth
under chemoradiotherapy remain elusive. In the present study, we define a previously
unidentified role for COX-2 in regulating caspase-3 and HuR cleavage in oral cancer cells.
Here we show that, inhibition of COX-2 activity by celecoxib, promotes caspase-3 activation
and HuR cleavage, which destabilizes COX-2 mRNA. Our observations suggest that
disruption of the COX-2/HuR reciprocal feedback loop, can sensitize paclitaxel-resistant
oral cancer cells to treatment.

Cleavage of HuR is cancer cell specific

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We previously showed that treatment of hypoxia and ionizing radiation (IR) promoted the
cleavage of HuR through active caspase-39, 10. Here, in order to determine if chemo- and
radio-therapy promoted the cleavage of HuR in drug resistant and sensitive oral cancer cells,
we treated 74B oral cancer cells with a variety of cytotoxic agents and IR. Treatment of
paclitaxel, doxorubicin and IR induced the cleavage of HuR; however, cisplatin did not
promote HuR cleavage even at the highest concentration of 10µM (Figure 1A and S1A).
Next, to extend our observation, we monitored the cleavage of HuR during paclitaxel
treatment of primary (nomenclature of A) and recurrent (nomenclature of B) oral cancer
cells. HuR was preferentially cleaved in the recurrent cell lines, compared to the primary cell
lines; one exception was 22A cells which exhibited less cleavage of HuR compared to 22B
cells (Figure 1B). Based on the pattern of cleavage of HuR, we selected two primary oral
cancer cell lines UMSCC-11A and UMSCC-74A and two recurrent cell lines UMSCC-11B
and UMSCC-74B for further analysis. To determine if the cleavage of HuR associated with
active caspase-3, paclitaxel treated cells were probed for active caspase-3 and HuR. As
shown in Figure 1C, recurrent cell lines 11B and 74B exhibited strong cleavage of HuR and
caspase-3 compared to 11A cells. In contrast, primary 74A cells showed minimal HuR
cleavage in association with activation of caspase-3 compared to 74B cells. Previous
observations indicated that the cleavage of HuR is a cytoplasmic event controlled by active
caspase-328, hence, we monitored the subcellular localization of HuR under paclitaxel. As
shown in Figure 1D, presence of HuR was noted in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of 11A
and 74B cells with or without treatment of paclitaxel. Although the cytoplasmic presence of
HuR was observed in both 11A and 74B cells, the lack of active caspase-3 in 11A cells
failed to cleave HuR compared to 74B cells under paclitaxel (Figure 1C–D). Collectively,
these data suggest that paclitaxel mediated cleavage of HuR associated with active caspase-3
in cancer cells.
Next, to determine whether the observed changes in caspase-3 and HuR altered the rate of
cell death under paclitaxel treatment, the percentage of apoptotic cells were quantified. As
shown in Figure 1E, paclitaxel treated primary 11A and 74A cells (Figure S1B) exhibited
reduced rate of apoptosis (from ~3% to 9%, 74A cells exhibits ~15 to 25%, Figure S1B)

compared to 74B cells (~17 % to 70%; Figure 1E). These data indicated that paclitaxel
induced apoptosis in recurrent 74B cells was significantly higher than primary 11A and 74A
oral cancer cells. To test if the altered apoptotic rates were mediated through HuR, we
silenced HuR and quantified the number of apoptotic cells under paclitaxel. As shown in
Figure 1F, silencing of HuR by shRNA reduced the rate of cell death in 74B cells, indicating
that HuR partly facilitated apoptosis in paclitaxel treated cells. We did not detect a
significant change in the apoptotic rate of 11A cells (Figure 1F), in part due to inactivation
of caspase-3 under paclitaxel. Altogether, our findings indicated that paclitaxel induced
caspase-3 activation, promoted HuR cleavage and enhanced apoptosis in recurrent cancer
cells compared to primary oral cancer cells.
HuR controls COX-2 expression in oral cancer cells

Our previous observation demonstrated that the non-cleavable isoform of HuR (HuRD226A), increased cell proliferation compared to the full-length or cleavable isoforms of
HuR10. The presence of cellular non-cleavable HuR and inactive caspase-3 in primary tumor
cells compared to recurrent cells during paclitaxel treatment suggested that non-cleavable
HuR and inactive caspase-3 may facilitate cell proliferation and drug resistance (Figure 1C).
To further assess this, we determined the levels of HuR target mRNAs encoding proteins
involved in cell proliferation such as COX-2, c-MYC, c-JUN and IL-8 in 11A and 74B cells.
These mRNAs contain AU-rich elements, HuR recognition sequence motifs, in their 3'
untranslated region (UTR). Most HuR target mRNAs were down regulated in 74B cells
during paclitaxel treatment (Figure 2A). In contrast, 11A cells exhibited reduced levels of cMYC, c-JUN and IL-8 mRNAs but significant upregulation of COX-2 mRNA under
paclitaxel treatment (Figure 2B). Next, to determine whether the observed changes in
COX-2 and other mRNAs were due to direct association with HuR, we performed
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) IP on control and paclitaxel-treated cells using an antibody against
HuR. The HuR-associating mRNAs were then measured by RT-qPCR. As shown in Figure
2A and 2B, we observed a strong association of COX-2 mRNA with HuR in 11A cells (~68
fold) compared to 74B cells (~18 fold) after treatment with paclitaxel (Figure 2C, 74B cells
and 2D, 11A cells). Interestingly, the basal COX-2 protein levels in 11A cells is ~3.0 fold
higher than 74B cells (Figure 2E). In addition, like mRNA expression, the COX-2 protein
levels were increased 2.0 fold in paclitaxel treated 11A cells compared to control cells. In
contrast, COX-2 protein level showed a moderate decrease from 1.0 fold 0.9 fold after
paclitaxel treatment in 74B cells (Figure 2E). The remaining mRNAs c-myc, c-Jun and IL-8
mRNAs were also bound with HuR in IP samples.

Author Manuscript

Next, to determine if the alteration of COX-2 protein during paclitaxel treatment was due to
changes in COX-2 mRNA stability, we treated both cell lines with paclitaxel and estimated
the half-life (t1/2) of the mRNA under actinomycin-D (ActD). As shown in Figure 2F–G,
after paclitaxel treatment COX-2 mRNA was unstable in 74B cells (t1/2 decreased from
~6:30 hrs to ~4 hrs) compared to 11A cells (t1/2 increased from ~5 hrs to ~ 7:20 hrs),
indicating that paclitaxel promotes the stability of COX-2 mRNA in 11A cells. To directly
assess whether COX-2 mRNA expression is controlled by HuR, we silenced HuR and
evaluated COX-2 mRNA levels using RT-qPCR. The shRNA-mediated silencing of HuR
reduced the relative expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression in both cell lines

(Figure 3A–B). Next, the half-life of COX-2 mRNA was measured in HuR silenced 74B and
11A cells. In shcontrol 74B and 11A cells, COX-2 mRNA t1/2 was more than 6 hours, while
in HuR silenced cells, the half-life was reduced to approximately 4 hours (Figure 3C–D),
indicating that HuR directly controls COX-2 stability in both cell lines. Collectively, these
data demonstrated that HuR is a dominant protein controlling COX-2 mRNA expression in
cancer cells, but the observed difference in basal COX-2 protein expression between 74B
and 11A cells may be due in part to additional regulatory pathways.
Inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib promotes active caspase-3 and HuR cleavage

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Increased COX-2 expression is correlated with tumor cell resistance to chemotherapeutic
drugs29. Inhibition of COX-2 activity by celecoxib, resulted in increased apoptosis,
activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP cleavage23. Hence, we sought to determine
whether selective inhibition of COX-2 with celecoxib during paclitaxel treatment altered
COX-2 activity, using a COX-2 enzymatic assay30. As shown in Figure 4A, basal COX-2
activity in 11A cells was significantly higher compared to 74B cells. Upon treatment with
both celecoxib and paclitaxel, we observed a significant reduction in COX-2 activity in 11A
cells in comparison to 11A cells treated with paclitaxel alone (Figure 4A). To determine if
this combinatorial therapy in 11A cells induced caspase activation and HuR cleavage, the
cells were treated for 2 hrs with paclitaxel and celecoxib, and protein expression was
measured by Western blot. As expected, inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib in association
with paclitaxel treatment, promoted the cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR after 2 hours in 11A
cells (Figure 4B). In addition, 74B cells treated with paclitaxel alone for 2 hours did not
exhibit cleavage of HuR but both celecoxib and paclitaxel treatment promoted the cleavage
of HuR (Figure 4B). In both cell lines, treatment of celecoxib alone failed to induce
caspase-3 or HuR cleavage. To test whether the observed changes in the cleavage of
caspase-3 and HuR altered the rate of apoptosis during celecoxib and paclitaxel treatment,
we quantified the rate of apoptosis in both cell lines. As shown in Figure 4C, after 2 hours of
celecoxib and paclitaxel treatment, the primary 11A cells exhibited increased apoptosis
(~7% to ~18%) compared to paclitaxel alone (~3 % to ~7%; Figure 4C–D). In addition, the
apoptotic rate in celecoxib and paclitaxel treated 74B cells increased (~15% to ~35%)
compared to paclitaxel alone (Figure 4C–D). Collectively, these data suggest that
combinatorial treatment with celecoxib and paclitaxel, is sufficient to induce HuR cleavage
and activate apoptosis in COX-2 driven drug resistant oral cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

It has been reported that overexpression of HuR cleavage products induced cell death under
stress11. In order to investigate whether HuR cleavage product-1 and paclitaxel are sufficient
to induce apoptosis by activating caspase-3 in primary oral cancer cells, we transiently
overexpressed the cleaved HuR isoform GFP-CP1 in 11A and 74A cells. As expected, we
observed cleavage of both HuR and caspase-3 in paclitaxel treated GFP-CP1 overexpressing
11A and 74A cells after 16hrs (lane 4 and 8 in Figure 4E); whereas, DMSO or paclitaxel
treated GFP control cells and DMSO treated GFP-CP1 cells exhibited no cleavage of HuR
and caspase-3 (lanes 1–3 and 5–7 in Figure 4E). These data demonstrate that overexpression
of HuR-CP1 in combination with paclitaxel may overcome drug resistance in oral cancer
cells.

To gain insights into the cancer promoting and drug resistance function of COX-2 and HuR
in vivo, we subcutaneously injected equal number of 11A or 74B cells into the right and left
flank of 4 week old nude mice and monitored tumor growth. When the tumor volume
reached 25 mm3, we injected 100µL of DMSO and 20mg/kg of paclitaxel in 100µL of
DMSO intra-tumorally on the left and right flank of nude mice respectively, carrying either
11A or 74B cell derived xenograft tumors. The paclitaxel was injected once every two days
for 2 weeks or until the tumors reached 200 to 250 mm3 in volume. Paclitaxel treated 74B
derived xenograft tumors exhibited a reduction in growth after 10 days of treatment
compared to DMSO treated tumors (Figure 5A). In contrast, there was no observed
difference in tumor growth between DMSO and paclitaxel treated 11A derived xenograft
tumors (Figure 5B). However, paclitaxel and celecoxib treated 11A xenograft tumors
exhibited a reduction in growth after 12 days of treatment compared to paclitaxel alone
treated tumors (Figure 5B). In agreement with our in vitro data, western blot analysis of
paclitaxel treated 74B derived xenograft tumor samples showed HuR cleavage (Figure 5C),
whereas, DMSO treated 74B or 11A tumors and paclitaxel treated 11A tumors exhibited no
cleavage of HuR (Figure 5C). Next, we tested the cell proliferation marker Ki67 and
angiogenesis marker CD31 in 74B and 11A derived xenograft tumors. Ki67 and CD31
staining was high in both 74B and 11A DMSO treated tumors and paclitaxel treated 11A
tumors compared to paclitaxel treated 74B and paclitaxel/celecoxib treated 11A derived
tumors (Figure 5D, quantitative representation illustrated in 5E). To detect apoptosis in the
tumors, we stained the tissues with TUNEL and measured cell death. As shown in Figure 5F,
both 74B paclitaxel and 11A paclitaxel/celecoxib treated tumors exhibited pronounced cell
death compared to control tumors. Altogether, data from xenograft studies indicate that
overexpression of COX-2 and non-cleavable HuR may control tumor growth and paclitaxel
resistance of 11A cells in vivo.
HuR cleavage product-1 (HuR-CP1) specifically associates with mRNAs encoding proteins
involved in cell death

Author Manuscript

HuR-CP1 and CP2 are known to promote apoptosis by altering the expression of apoptosisassociated ARE containing mRNAs11. To determine whether full-length HuR, HuR-CP1 and
non-cleavable form of HuR (HuR-D226A) forms a complex with target mRNAs under IR,
we have used RNP IP assay followed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Figure 6A
illustrates the methodology of RNP IP assays, HTS analysis and target enrichment analysis.
First, 74B cells stably transfected with GFP-tagged HuR, HuR-CP1 and HuR-D226A
isoforms were irradiated with ionizing radiation of 10Gy and cultured for 24 hours to
promote cell death and cleavage of HuR (Figure 6B). IR induced the cleavage of GFP-HuRFL but did not promote the cleavage of GFP-HuR-D226A compared to control GFP
expressing cells (Figure 6B). Interestingly, overexpression of HuR-CP1 and HuR-FL
minimizes the cleavage of cellular HuR possibly through competitive binding with
caspase-3. Next, to determine if these isoforms of HuR bound with target mRNAs, we
conducted RNP IP assay using anti-GFP antibody. The GFP-bound RNAs were extracted
and subjected to HTS analysis. The mRNAs that were bound to GFP versus full-length HuR
(Table S1), HuR-CP1 (Table S2) and HuR-D226A (Table S3) were compared with known
HuR targets identified through PAR-CLIP31 (Figure 6C). As shown in Figure 6C, there are

644 target mRNAs bound to full-length HuR, HuR-CP1 and HuR-D226A isoforms, but
more than 3000 targets associated with HuR-D226A isoform alone and only 26 targets were
exclusively bound to HuR-CP1. These data suggest that HuR-D226A has an enhanced
capability to bind RNA compared to HuR-CP1. Interestingly, HuR-CP1 associated with
several target mRNAs encoding proteins noted to be involved in the cell death pathway
(Table 1 and Figure 6D). Next, bioinformatic analysis revealed that mRNA sequences that
bound with HuR contained several AREs in their 3'UTR (Figure 6E, S4). Thus, our findings
indicate that HuR-CP1 specifically binds with mRNAs involved in cell death. Altogether,
our model (Figure 6F) illustrates that the overexpression of COX-2, blocks the cleavage of
caspase-3 and HuR, thus promoting drug resistance.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression is always tightly associated with
mRNA processing, transport, stability and translation. These processes are critical for
precise control of gene expression and regulate several cancer biological pathways including
cell death and proliferation. RBPs are the major determining factors that facilitate posttranscriptional gene expression. During cancer progression RBPs are post translationally
modified and are involved in drug resistance. Here, we show that RBP HuR undergoes a
post-translational modification which is integral to chemotherapeutic drug susceptibility in
oral cancer cells. HuR control of COX-2 mRNA expression is well-known. Multiple studies
demonstrated that HuR directly associates with AU-rich elements present in the 3' UTR of
COX-2 and controls COX-2 stability and translation32. Overexpressed COX-2 protein is
reported in multiple cancers, including colon,33 stomach,16 lung,17 esophagus,18 pancreas,18
bladder,34 prostate35 and oral cavity19–22. In oral cancer, expression of COX-2 is associated
with tumor size and poor patient response to chemoradiation26. Based on our findings in this
report, we establish that HuR controls COX-2 mRNA stability in both 11A and 74B cells. In
addition, activated caspase-3 promoted the cleavage of HuR during paclitaxel treatment in
74B cells; however, 11A cells, which exhibits increased levels of COX-2 protein, failed to
cleave both caspase-3 and HuR. Interestingly, in support of these observations, HuR was
reported to enhance COX-2 mRNA stability in mammary epithelial cells treated with
taxanes36. Altogether, our observations indicate that overexpression of COX-2 may play a
positive role in cancer progression by promoting resistance to paclitaxel treatment, through
blocking the activation and cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR, respectively.

Author Manuscript

Caspases are defined as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes by executing cell death in
normal cells or undergo severe suppression in some cancers. For example, absence of
caspase-3 was reported in multiple cancers including breast cancer tissues37, hepatocellular,
and prostate carcinoma38. In addition, inactive caspase-3 was reported in both oral
carcinoma and differentiated normal oral epithelial tissues39, but the molecular basis for this
inactivation of caspase-3 was not known. Our results clearly indicate that overexpressed
COX-2 inhibits the cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR in oral cancer cells. Taken together, the
level of COX-2 and HuR can be used as an index for oral cancer patient prognosis and
survival. Moreover, COX-2 and HuR may also be therapeutic targets for oral malignancy,
particularly in patients who underwent chemotherapy that resulted in drug resistance.

HuR alters many biological functions in cancer cells which includes mediating apoptotic or
anti-apoptotic responses.9, 40, 41. Post-translational modification of HuR may provide a
mechanism to control the stability of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the apoptosis
pathway. For instance, HuR cleavage products are known to target several genes, such as
Caspase-9, and control their mRNA stability and expression11. We assume that the apoptotic
function of cleaved HuR in the form ofHuR-CP1, its associated target mRNAs and their
coding proteins, may provide an opportunity to develop novel therapeutics. Based on our
RNP IP analysis, we were able to identify HuR targets such as ING442, RNF21643 and
CDK11A44, which are associated with apoptosis suggesting a novel mechanism whereby
HuR-CP1 initiates cell death by controlling a subset of mRNAs encoding apoptotic proteins.
Furthermore, we have previously shown that HuR-CP1, inhibits c-myc mRNA translation
under hypoxic lethal stress10.- In addition, reports postulate that HuR-CP1 binds with
multiple protein partners and controls the cell death pathway28, 40. As HuR-CP1 impacts the
cellular HuR cleavage (Figure 6B), there is a strong possibility that HuR-CP1 could play a
role in apoptotic pathway either as an initiator or competitor full length HuR to alter the cell
death machinery. Hence, it would be interesting to identify HuR-CPs and their role in posttranscriptional gene regulation. Based on our RNP IP and transcriptome analysis, we were
able to identify several novel HuR-CP1 regulons compared to full length HuR that could
potentially impact apoptosis pathway.

transfections of plasmids were conducted by using Lipofectamine-2000 (Life Technologies).
For HuR transient silencing experiments, cells were transduced with either a scrambled

Immunoblotting and Apoptosis assay
The cell lysates were separated by SDS–PAGE and followed by immunoblotting using
antibodies against HuR (Santa Cruz, sc-5261), caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, 8G10) and COX-2
(One World Lab, 43977). Apoptosis assay was carried out based on manufacturer’s protocol
(Annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit; Biovision, K128-100).

100 ng of total RNA from RIP samples was used to prepare RNA-seq libraries using the
TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), following the protocol described
by the manufacturer. High throughput sequencing (HTS) was performed on an Illumina
HiSeq2500 with each sample sequenced to a minimum depth of ~50 million reads using a
paired end approach. The primary data analysis demanded that >80% of the sequence data
had a Phred score of 30 in accordance with Illumina quality control (QC) procedures.
Secondary data analysis involved an RNAseq workflow to process the data. This enabled
data validation and quality control, read alignment to the human genome (hg19) using
TopHat247, which indicated >93% read mapping. Gene-level count data was extracted with
HTSeq and DEseq248 was utilized to uncover differential expression with robust statistical
power. The workflow was executed on a OnRamp Bioinformatics Genomics Research
Platform. Software versioning included FastQValidator v0.1.1a, Fastqc v0.11.3, Bowtie2
v2.1.0, TopHat2 v2.0.9, HTSeq v0.6.0 and DEseq v1.8.0. Transcript count data from the
DESeq2 analysis of the samples was ranked based on the q-value from lowest to highest.
FDR is the expected fraction of false positive tests among significant tests and was
calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure. Statistical
analysis of pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms was carried as described by us

UMSCC-74B and UMSCC-11A cells were harvested a brief exposure to 0.02% EDTA and
0.05% trypsin. After blocking trypsinization the cells were washed with HBSS, then
resuspended in complete medium and counted with a hemocytomer. Only suspensions
containing viable cells (>90%) were used for transplantation experiments. Approximately 4
million UMSCC-74B or UMSCC-11A cells were suspended in 100µl of complete medium
containing 30% Matrigel (Corning) /and injected into the flank of the nude mice using a
tuberculin syringe and 30-gauge needle, as described previously. A total of 16 mice (8 mice
for 74B oral cancer cells group and 8 mice for 11A oral cancer cells group) received
injection. Once in every two days, the weight of the mice and size of the tumors were
measured. The formula V=1/2(L×W^2) was used to calculate and measure the tumor

volume. The maximum tumor volume of 25 mm3 as a cut off for the injection of paclitaxel
and celecoxib. Mice with same sized tumors were randomized into two groups (n=5) group
1 (control) received 100µl DMSO and group 2 (paclitaxel treatment) received 20mg/kg
paclitaxel dissolved in DMSO and injected intra-tumorally. Using a 5% level of significance,
80% power, and a standard deviation in tumor volume within a group, the two-sided t-test
states those 5 animals per group is sufficient to detect a difference in tumor volume between
any groups.
ARE motif analysis

Author Manuscript

A basic R script based on the biomart R library was used to retrieve 3´UTR sequences. The
longest 3´UTR sequences retrieved for each gene was scanned with a custom PERL script.
The script performed a basic string match in scalar mode for ARE motifs in each 3´UTR.
The script tracked the total number of 3´UTR matches and also counted the number of
matches for each of the ARE motifs. These latter numbers were then charted with the
standard Microsoft EXCEL 3D pie chart function.
Statistics
The graphical data are represented as mean ± S.D. We used student’s t tests with equal
variances to assess differences between means. p values <0.05 were considered significant.
