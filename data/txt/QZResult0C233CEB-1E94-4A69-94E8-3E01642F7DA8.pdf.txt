ABSTRACT
Haematological malignancies are tumours that affect the haematopoietic and
the lymphatic systems. Despite the huge efforts to eradicate these tumours, the
percentage of patients suffering resistance to therapies and relapse still remains
significant. The tumour environment favours drug resistance of cancer cells, and
particularly of cancer stem/initiating cells. Hypoxia promotes aggressiveness,
metastatic spread and relapse in most of the solid tumours. Furthermore, hypoxia is
associated with worse prognosis and resistance to conventional treatments through
activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors. Haematological malignancies are not
considered solid tumours, and therefore, the role of hypoxia in these diseases was
initially presumed to be inconsequential. However, hypoxia is a hallmark of the
haematopoietic niche. Here, we will review the current understanding of the role
of both hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factors in different haematological tumours.

HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES

myeloid leukaemia (CML) cases are indeed cured or
well controlled. Overall survival at 5 years is over 60%
and around 80% in patients with non-Hodgkin and
Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively [4, 5]. In contrast, CLL
and AML have a high risk of relapse, and MM remains
mostly incurable [6, 7, 8]. There is compelling evidence
that a small population of stem-like cancer cells with the
capacity for self-renewal and differentiation accounts for
resistance and recurrence in many types of cancer [8, 9]. In
the context of HMs, these cells are known as leukaemia-,
lymphoma- or myeloma-initiating cells (from now on
referred to as haematological cancer stem cells, HCSCs).
Although there is some controversy on the phenotype of
such a population(s), HCSCs are certainly involved in the
initiation and maintenance of HMs [10-14].
Cancer research has been mostly focused on cancer
cells themselves. However, it is now well accepted that
tumours are complex tissues sustained by the dynamic
interactions between cancer cells and their environment.
This environment consists of a number of cell types
(fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, macrophages,
antigen-presenting cells, etc) and many different
molecules (growth factors, cytokines, chemokines,

Haematological malignancies (HMs) are tumours
characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of cells from
the immune and the haematopoietic system. In Europe,
recent analyses show an age-standardized incidence
rate of 32 tumours per 100.000 persons/year [1]. These
heterogeneous pathologies are nowadays classified based
on the affected cell lineage as myeloid or lymphoid.
Neoplasias of lymphoid origin are the most frequently
observed (75% of the total HMs) with multiple myeloma
(MM), small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma (SBLL)
/ chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma
(HL) being the most common. Acute myeloid leukaemia
(AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) account for the highest
rate among the myeloid malignancies [2, 3]. Despite
the differences in biology, clinical manifestations and
outcome between disease subtypes, an overall significant
progress in terms of diagnosis and cure rates has been
achieved in the past decades. To date, the majority of

extracellular matrix, adhesion molecules, etc), which
are commonly referred to as the tumour stroma [15].
Forty years ago, studies performed in the laboratory of
Dr John Trentin demonstrated that stromal cells had an
active role supporting haematopoiesis [16]. Furthermore,
experimental evidence has demonstrated the interaction
between stroma and haematologic cancer cells (HCCs)
[17] (Figure 1). This is especially relevant in the case
of HCSCs that house in niches contributing to a protumourigenic environment [18, 19]. Therefore, the
key challenges of HMs are to decipher in detail who
participates and how in these complex networks that
synergize to promote cancer progression.

factors favour MM tumour development and lymphoma
progression [43-53]. Hypoxia induces metabolic changes,
enhances survival, reduces differentiation and promotes
self-renewal of mesenchymal/stromal cells [54-56].
Furthermore, co-culture with these cells in hypoxia
promotes maintenance and expansion of normal HSCs
and human AML cells [39, 56, 57]. Finally, the poorly
oxygenated niche and the hypoxia-induced glycololytic
metabolism have been linked to chemoresistance in
B-ALL, T-ALL, AML, lymphoma and MM cases [58-76].

HIF, THE MASTER HYPOXIA-SIGNALLING
MEDIATOR: IMPLICATIONS IN HMS AND
THE STROMAL COMPARTMENT

HYPOXIA IN HMS AND THE STROMAL
COMPARTMENT

The hypoxia-inducible transcription factors
(HIFs) are central regulators of the cellular response to
hypoxia [77]. HIF is a heterodimer composed of one of
three oxygen-regulated HIF-α subunits (HIF-1α, HIF2α and HIF-3α) and the constitutively expressed HIF-β
subunit [78, 79]. HIF-1α and HIF-2α, also known as
endothelial PAS protein (EPAS1), are the major activators
of hypoxia-induced gene transcription, but, to date, little
is known about expression and function of HIF-3α [80].
HIF-α proteins share similar structural domains such as
an N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain
involved in DNA binding, two Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS)
domains allowing dimerisation, an oxygen-dependent
degradation domain (ODDD), and the transactivation
domain (TAD). While HIF-3α contains only one TAD,
HIF-1α and HIF-2α contain an N-terminal (NTAD) and a
C-terminal (CTAD) transactivation domain for recruitment
of transcriptional coactivators [81]. In well-oxygenated
cells, HIF-α subunits are hydroxylated by the family of
prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHDs)
on two conserved proline residues (Pro402 and Pro564
in the Human HIF-1α sequence) within the ODDD [82].
The hydroxylated motif allows the binding of the von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, which mediates HIF-α
ubiquitination and the further targeting to the proteasome
for degradation [83]. While the PHD family consists
of four PHDs, PHD1, 2 and 3 have been characterized
much more extensively than PHD4, which is bound to
the membrane of the reticulum endoplasmic [84-86].
Moreover, PHD2 has been described to be the main PHD
controlling HIF-1α stability and levels in normoxia [87].
PHDs act as intracellular molecular sensors that use O2 as
a substrate, and thus, their activity is compromised upon
hypoxia [88, 89]. Thereby, HIF-α evades PHD/pVHLmediated degradation, dimerises with HIF-1β and the HIF
complex binds to specific HIF-response elements (HRE)
of target genes. The oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of
an asparagine residue in the CTAD of HIF-α (Asn803 in
the Human HIF-1α sequence) by Factor Inhibiting HIF
(FIH) negatively regulates HIF-target gene expression by
impairing the recruitment of the co-activators CBP/p300

Hypoxia is, by definition, a state of reduced
oxygenation that influences biological functions [20].
Since the initial indication made by Thomlinson and
Gray, it is well established that hypoxia is a characteristic
feature of solid tumours [21]. Unlike the normal
tissue vasculature, the primitive and chaotic tumour
neovasculature is unable to meet all the oxygen and
nutrients demands. Nevertheless, this poor and hostile
milieu drives cancer cell survival, cancer stem cell
maintenance, metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis and
modulation of immune response, so that tumour hypoxia
is associated with aggressiveness, metastatic spread and
relapse [22].
Compared to most healthy tissues, the bone marrow
(BM) environment is characterized by low oxygen
availability. A relatively low level of oxygen is indeed a
hallmark of the BM stem cell niche, and hypoxia induces
the secretion of several growth factors and cytokines such
as SDF-1/CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor), VEGF
(vascular endothelial growth factor) and interleukin-6
involved in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintenance
[23-27]. In vitro studies have shown that myelomatous
BM environment is more hypoxic than the normal BM
[28]. Jensen et al. remarked an increase in BM hypoxia
during disease progression using a rat AML model [29].
Moreover, using pimonidazole staining for measuring
hypoxia levels, Konopleva et al. elegantly demonstrated
the high prevalence of hypoxia in human leukaemic BM
[30]. Therefore, hypoxia certainly affects the different
components of BM and modulates the highly complex and
strictly regulated interactions between cancer and stromal
cells. Hypoxia sustained AML- and CML-initiating cell
maintenance, although contradictory effects on HCCs
proliferation have been reported [29, 31-39]. In addition,
neoangiogenesis and increased release of hypoxia-induced
angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF, bFGF (basicfibroblast growth factor) and angiopoietin 1 & 2 have been
reported in AML and childhood ALL patients [40-42].
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that angiogenic

most CML cases but also found in ALL and AML patients,
induces HIF-1α similarly to FLT3 [106]. Src, another
proto-oncogen with a relevant role in HMs, activates HIF
through the NADPH oxidase/Rac pathway [107]. NPM
(nucleophosmin or nucleolar phosphoprotein B23), which
is mutated and chromosomally translocated in many HMs,
stimulates HIF activity by inactivating p14ARF [108,
109]. Moreover, contradictory results have been observed
regarding IDH mutations and HIF-α accumulation [110112].
HIF drives the transcription of genes involved in
many pathways promoting angiogenesis and vascular
remodelling, proliferation, survival and invasion of
cancer cells and stem cell maintenance [113] (Figure 2).
Overall, increased HIF-α expression is correlated with
tumour growth and therapy resistance and, therefore,
with disease relapse [114, 115]. Accordingly, sustained
expression of HIF-α is a marker of poor prognosis not

In addition to hypoxia, a number of studies have
reported HIF-α sustained protein expression independently
of oxygen availability. Growth factors and cytokines such
as EGF (epidermal growth factor), FGF-2, heregulin,
insulin, IGF1&2 (insulin-like growth factor 1 and 2),
IL-1β, TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor α) and factors
specifically involved in haematopoiesis such as SCF
(stem cell factor) and thrombopoietin positively regulate
HIF activity [91-98]. In addition to loss of function
mutations in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and PTEN, or
gain of function mutations in Myc, Ras and Raf [99102], prevalent mutations found in HMs also promote
HIF expression and activity. Hence, activating mutations
of FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), recognized as the
most common molecular abnormality in AML [103],
increase HIF-α accumulation via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway [104, 105]. Bcr/Abl, an oncoprotein present in

niches in the bone marrow. Both HSCs and HCSCs niches are composed of a collection of different cell types, growth factors and
cytokines, which are localized close to the endosteum and sinusoids. Oxygen levels decrease from the sinusoids to the endosteum. HCSCs
expand within the hypoxic endosteal niche while take advantage of the vascular niche to colonize distant organs.

only in several types of solid tumours but also in HMs
[116-129]. Therefore, inhibition of HIF-α (either by RNAi
or small molecules) resulted in a failure of primary cells to
form in vitro colonies and significantly increased diseasefree survival in vivo [36, 118, 130-136]. However, the
specific role of HIFs in HMs seems to be controversial
and contradictory data have also been published. Thus
HIF-1α has been reported to induce cell differentiation in
AML, and loss of HIF-1α resulted in faster development
of the disease and reduced survival [137-142]. Similarly,
HIF-1α overexpression associated with increased survival
in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [143].
Such an apparent controversy could be explained by
the different system used (mouse versus human), the
unspecificity of shRNA/drugs compared to knock-out
models or the hypoxic exposure. Therefore, further studies
will be certainly needed to clarify the oncogenic and/or
tumour suppressor activity of HIF signalling in HMs, and
particularly within HCSCs.
Homing and subsequent adhesion of cancer stem
cells to the vascular and the endosteal niche triggers the in
vivo tumour-stroma interactions. The chemokine receptor
CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4) and its ligand
SDF-1/CXCL12 mediate this process and it is well known
that HIF-1α regulates the expression of both [144, 145].
Moreover, the involvement of this axis in chemoresistance
has been deeply demonstrated in HMs [146-151]. In
this regard, it has been recently published that HIF-1α
increases the interaction of CLL cells with the stroma
and that stromal cells protect mantle cell lymphoma cells
from the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents

[152, 153]. Furthermore, aberrant expression of HIF-1α
in bone marrow endothelial cells has been linked to drug
resistance and recurrence in patients with MM [126].

HYPOXIA AND/OR HIFS AS TARGETS
TO TREAT HMS
All the previously reported data emphasize the
relevance of fighting against hypoxia and HIF signalling
in HMs. Not only HCCs but also the stromal compartment
should be targeted to fully frustrate the pro-tumourigenic
environment promoted by their interaction. The therapeutic
strategy aiming to directly target hypoxic cells within
tumours remains a challenging approach, while success
in clinical trials has so far proved elusive [154]. This
approach relies mostly on the use of hypoxia-activated
prodrugs (HAPs) or bioreductive drugs. The prodrugs are
inactive medications that require metabolization before
exhibiting pharmacological effects. In particular, HAPs
require activation by oxygen-inhibited enzymes (typically
by 1 or 2 electron oxidoreductases) to generate cytotoxic
compounds [154]. One of the most extensively examined
HAPs is evofosfamide (TH-302), the reductive activation
of which generates bromo-isophosphoramide mustard
(Br-IMP), a potent alkylating agent. TH-302 exhibited
specific hypoxia-dependent cytotoxicity when tested in
primary ALL and AML samples in vitro and reduced the
AML stem cell pool in vivo [155, 156]. Similarly, TH302 induced cell cycle arrest and triggered apoptosis in
severely hypoxic conditions in MM, while had no effect
at similar doses in normoxic conditions [38]. A phase I/

Figure 2: O2-dependent and -independent HIF signalling pathway. In well-oxygenated cells, the hydroxylation of HIF-α
catalyzed by PHDs triggers VHL-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation into the proteasome. In contrast, low oxygen
availability stabilizes HIF-α by compromising PHD activity. Moreover, activation of oncogenes, loss of tumour suppressors, growth
factors, specific prevalent mutations found in HMs and factors involved in haematopoiesis are also able to upregulate HIF-α independently
of oxygen availability. Once stabilized, HIF-α translocates to the nucleus, binds to HIF-β and regulates the expression of genes promoting
tumour progression.

II clinical trial in relapsed or refractory ALL or AML has
been carried out using PR-104, which also results in the
generation of a DNA-damaging metabolite. In this study,
PR-104 demonstrated measurable clinical activity but
also significant toxicity at the doses administered in the
trial [30]. It is worth nothing that novel HAPs designed
to release targeted therapeutics (pioneered by TH-4000
that releases EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) have been
recently developed, though to our knowledge no data
related to HMs are available [154].
Regarding the use of drugs directly targeting HIF,
several chemical inhibitors have been tested in different
models. Echinomycin (NSC-13502) is an antibiotic
derivative from the quinoxaline family, which inhibits
HIF-1α/DNA binding activity. This inhibitor has been
previously evaluated in clinical trials in solid tumours,
though with disappointing results [157]. Interestingly,
echinomycin abrogated in vitro and in vivo lymphoma
and AML growth through preferential targeting of HCSCs
[132, 133, 158]. HIF-1α inhibition by 2-methoxyestradiol
(2ME2), and endogenous metabolite of oestrogen
that disrupt microtubule architecture, and YC-1(3(5’hydroxymethyl-2’-furyl)-1-benzy-lindazole) induced
cell death in different HMs [159]. L-ascorbic acid was
also able to specifically inhibit the proliferation of human
CML cells via downregulation of HIF-1α transcription
[135]. EZN-2968, a small 3rd generation antisense
oligonucleotide against HIF1A mRNA, delayed acute
promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and MM progression
[160, 161]. EZN-2968 has also been reported to block
the interaction between MM cells and BM stromal
cells through HIF-1α inhibition [161]. Furthermore,
the combination of EZN-2088, a polyethylene glycol
conjugate of irinotecan (PEG-SN38), with all-trans retinoic
acid (ATRA) synergized to eradicate preclinical models
of PML-RARα (promyelocytic leukaemia protein-retinoic
receptor antagonist alpha) and PLZF (promyelocytic
leukaemia zinc finger)-RARα-driven leukaemia [160].
More recently, it has been shown that chetomin, a small
molecule able to disrupt HIF-1α binding to the p300
coactivator, exhibited antitumor activity in primary
MM cells from patients [162]. Similarly, acriflavine,
another FDA-approved HIF inhibitor, has demonstrated
specificity towards CML stem cells [163]. Moreover, it
should be pointed out the relevance of bortezomib (PS341), a proteasome inhibitor, in the treatment of MM
and mantle cell lymphoma patients. Relapse/refractory
but also newly diagnosed cases benefit of bortezomib
either as single agent or combined with other therapies
[164, 165]. Indeed, bortezomib has been reported to
repress HIF-1 (and not HIF-2)-dependent transcriptional
activity by reinforcing FIH-mediated inhibition of p300
recruitment [166]. Supporting combinatorial therapeutic
options, TH-302 together with bortezomib induced MM
cell cycle arrest and triggered apoptosis in severe hypoxic
conditions, while having no effect at similar doses in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

normoxic conditions [167]. More recently, PT2385 has
been developed as a selective agent that blocks HIF-2α
with potent anti-cancer activity in preclinical models of
advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) [168170]. However, this inhibitor has not been still tested for
the treatment of HMs. Finally, it is worth mentioning that
several agents in current clinical practice to treat HMs
directly inhibit HIF-α, which might contribute to their
therapeutic efficacy. This is indeed the case for imatinib or
the topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan. Furthermore, the
potential impact of rituximab on HIF1α expression levels
might argue its favorable prognostic value in patients with
DLBCL treated with this monoclonal antibody [123].

CONCLUSION
Data reported from several research laboratories
claim that hypoxia and HIF-mediated signalling favour
haematologic and lymphoid tumour progression and
relapse. The results using hypoxia-activated prodrugs
and HIF-α inhibitors in different preclinical and clinical
models are really promising. Hence, these data give
exciting perspectives to define new and better therapeutic
approaches that may benefit patients suffering from HMs.
