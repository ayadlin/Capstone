ABSTRACT
The prime focus of the current therapeutic strategy for Multiple Myeloma (MM)
is to obtain an early and deep tumour burden reduction, up to the level of complete
response (CR). To date, no description of the characteristics of the plasma cells
(PC) prone to achieve CR has been reported. This study aimed at the molecular
characterization of PC obtained at baseline from MM patients in CR after bortezomibthalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) first line therapy.
One hundred and eighteen MM primary tumours obtained from homogeneously
treated patients were profiled both for gene expression and for single nucleotide
polymorphism genotype. Genomic results were used to obtain a predictor of sensitivity
to VTD induction therapy, as well as to describe both the transcription and the genomic
profile of PC derived from MM with subsequent optimal response to primary induction
therapy.
By analysing the gene profiles of CR patients, we identified a 5-gene signature
predicting CR with an overall median accuracy of 75% (range: 72%–85%). In addition,
we highlighted the differential expression of a series of genes, whose deregulation
might explain patients’ sensitivity to VTD therapy. We also showed that a small copy
number loss, covering 606Kb on chromosome 1p22.1 was the most significantly
associated with CR patients.

INTRODUCTION

transcription and a genomic profile distinguishing – right
from diagnosis - patients with MM who will respond
optimally to primary induction therapy with VTD.
Annotation analysis was applied to reveal which biological
functions critically influenced clinical response.

Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy
characterized by the proliferation in the bone marrow of
clonal plasma cells, which acquire resistance to therapy
as a result of their interaction with the bone marrow
microenvironment. The natural history of MM is usually
marked by multiple phases of relapse, which ultimately
lead refractory patients to death. The aim of current
myeloma therapy is to deepen the magnitude of response
and to delay or prevent relapses [1, 2]. For this purpose,
induction, consolidation and/or maintenance therapy are
integral components of the modern treatment paradigm for
MM patients [3–6]. The prime focus of induction therapy
is to reduce the tumour burden as much and as early as
possible, shrinking the residual disease to the level of
complete response (CR) [7]. Recent incorporation of first
and second generation immunomodulatory derivatives and
proteasome inhibitors into newer induction regimens has
enhanced the rate of CR compared to previous conventional
chemotherapy, thus leading to a substantial improvement of
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
[8–13]. Achievement of high-quality response to induction
therapy given before autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT) is an early and independent prognosticator of
favourable post ASCT outcomes and represents a primary
goal of current treatment strategies [14, 15].
However, despite evolution of modern therapeutic
approaches, the prognosis of MM still remains variable,
mostly driven by genetic abnormalities of the tumor clone
[16, 17] and a proportion of patients fail to benefit from
novel agents [18, 19]. Although identification of these
patients might be relevant for selecting a priori the best
treatment strategy, few biomarkers of response to novel
agent-based therapies are currently available [20, 21].
The GIMEMA MMY-3006 study comparing
Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) with
Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (TD) as induction therapy
before, and consolidation after, double ASCT provided
demonstration of the superior rate of response and PFS
offered by the triplet VTD combination [8]. In particular,
on an intention-to-treat basis, the rate of CR and near CR
after induction therapy, the primary study end point, was
approximately 3 times higher with VTD compared to TD.
Based on these results, we performed a biological substudy aimed at identifying the transcription profile and
genomic background of patients who either achieved or
failed CR after VTD induction therapy.
For this purpose, primary tumour cells obtained at
diagnosis from these patients were globally profiled for
both gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) genotypes, using an Affymetrix platform
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). By evaluating gene
expression profiling, we obtained a 5-gene signature,
which predicted the achievement of CR to VTD induction
therapy. We then succeeded in identifying both a

RESULTS
Response to induction therapy
For patients enrolled in the GIMEMA-MMY-3006
clinical trial, the achievement of CR after induction
therapy was an early and independent predictor for
prolonged PFS after ASCT. (median: 81 vs. 45 months,
p = 0.0011) and independently affected outcomes in a
multivariate analysis along with advanced ISS stage,
presence of t(4;14) and/or del(17p) and arm of treatment.
Among patients receiving VTD induction therapy,
CR was achieved in 15 patients (12.7%), while in the
remaining 103 patients the following response categories
were identified: near CR (nCR, 14 patients, 11.8%), Very
Good Partial Response (VGPR, 40 patients, 33.9%), Partial
Response (PR, 42 patients, 35.6%) and Stable Disease (SD,
7 patients, 5.9%). The most relevant clinical characteristics
at baseline were comparable among patients who achieved
CR and those who failed this objective, including t(4;14)
(p14;q32) and/or del(17p) frequency, as evaluated by FISH,
which was higher, although not at a statistically significant
level, in CR compared to <CR patients (36% vs. 22.5%).

Development of a GEP predictor for attainment
of CR after VTD induction therapy
The main objective of the study was to obtain a genebased classifier to be used to predict CR to VTD induction
therapy. For this purpose, we compared the transcription
profiles of patients who achieved CR vs. those of patients
who failed this objective and results were analysed, in
order to get an optimal-performing low-dimensional
signature for classifying the response to therapy.
The analysis resulted in identification of several
predictive signatures, among which a 5-gene one (Table 1)
performed best in predicting CR, with an overall median
accuracy of 75% (range: 72%–85%). The signature
median sensitivity was 87% (range: 66%–87%), the
median specificity was 73% (range: 73%–84%), the
median Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was 31% (range:
28%–44%) and the median Negative Predictive Value
(NPV) was 97% (range: 97%–98%). Of note, the profiled
samples had been collected before any therapy, thus
emphasising the predictive competence of the signature
in identifying the response to therapy. Genes and probes
included in the signature are detailed in Table 1: all
but one probe were differentially expressed in CR
patients (p<0.05), albeit with minimal fold change (FC)
fluctuations, thus suggesting that the classification power
9667

depends only on the multidimensional signature features
as a whole, rather than on single gene classification power.
In order to validate the results, the 5-gene predictive
signature was tested on two independent, previously
published, datasets: the first one (GSE55145) was generated
using the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST platform from newly
diagnosed MM patients enrolled in the IFM II clinical
trial [22] and included 67 patients, 10 of whom (15%)
obtained CR after bortezomib-dexamethason induction
therapy. The second one (GSE9872) was generated using
the Affymetrix HG-U133 A/B platform from relapsed
MM patients enrolled in the APEX/SUMMIT clinical trials
[23] and included 181 patients, 12 of whom (7%) obtained
CR after salvage therapy with bortezomib as a single agent.
Even though several discrepancies exist between the three
compared datasets (mainly regarding disease stage, therapy
and microarray platforms), the 5-gene signature median
prediction accuracies were - in the best case - 79% in
the IFM II dataset and 72% in the APEX/SUMMIT one
(see Table 2 for performance details).

of response were set up, with purpose view to identifying
the most informative transcription profile describing
the genetic environment of patients who achieved
CR after induction therapy. These analyses finally
resulted in identification of 5172 probes, representing
4281 genes according to the Affymetrix annotation
database, significantly diverging in their expression
among the most opposite response classes, i.e. CR
(15/118 samples) and PR/SD (49/118 samples) (p<0.05).
Indeed we assumed that the clinical-based definition of
these opposite response classes might actually reflect a
peculiar biological feature of the plasma cell, as well.
In order to better understand the data in the
context of MM, the list of differentially expressed
genes was analysed with the GeneGo® software filtering
tool, to enrich for genes already known to be related to
hematological diseases, thus obtaining a final list of 539
differentially expressed genes, with a fold change (FC)
ranging from −2.656 to 3.303 (Supplementary Table S1).
Of these, 363 genes were down-regulated, whereas
176 were over-expressed in patients achieving CR after
VTD. Genes did not cluster on a specific chromosome,
though chromosomes 1, 2, 19 and 17 (carrying 9.9%,
7.3%, 7.3% and 6.5% of the 539 differentially expressed
genes, respectively) were particularly over-represented.
By contrast, less than 2% of genes were located on
chromosomes 15, 21 and 13.

significantly deregulated in CR patients, as compared to
patients with PR/SD. Of interest, CCND2 and CCND1

Transcriptional program of patients who

The transcription profile of patients who achieved
CR was further analysed, in order to identify the

gene profiles of patients stratified according to the depth

In order to focus on the genomic background of
patients who achieved CR and to identify chromosomal
lesions potentially influencing response to induction
therapy, we then used Nexus Copy Number software to
compare the CNA profile of patients in CR and PR/SD
(15/89 vs. 37/89 patients): 111 CNAs (41 CN gains, 24 CN
losses and 46 LOH events) proved significantly associated
with VTD maximal sensitivity (p < 0.05, 25% differential
threshold). Of these, only 21 lasted when more stringent
comparison criteria were applied (p-value < 0.01 and 10%
differential threshold); an overall description of the 21
CNAs, including genes affected by each chromosomal
aberration, is shown in Table 4. Two small CN losses
on chromosome 1p22.1, covering 99 and 1,677 Kb,
respectively, and carrying 2 and 20 genes, respectively,
were the most significantly associated with CR patients,
both being present in 60% of CR and in 19% of PR/SD
patients, respectively (p = 0.006) (Figure 1).
In order to verify whether the genomic aberrations
also affected gene expression, we compared the gene
profiles of CR patients carrying recurrent chromosomal
aberrations vs. PR/SD patients not carrying any. We
showed that none of the CN gains seemed to affect
the expression of the amplified genes located within
the amplified region in CR patients; on the other hand,
the CN losses might account for the 39% decreased
expression of the genes located on the deleted regions
in CR patients, half of which proved to be significantly
down-expressed, with FC ranging from −0.21 to −1.29.
EVI5, being deleted in 60% of CR patients, was also
the most significant down-expressed gene (FC = −1.29,
p = 0.00014) of those located within the 1.3Mb deletion

expression proved to be mutually exclusive in CR
patients, where they showed the highest and the lowest
FC, respectively. Overall, MM plasma cell exhaustion,
which characterizes patients who responded to VTD
achieving CR, might be biologically accounted for by the
deregulation of MM’s key biology pathways, i.e. NFkB,
(a), IL6R, VEGF and IGF1R signalling pathways; (b)
basic cell processes (cell cycle and apoptosis regulation,
cell homing and migration); (c) other signal transduction
pathways related to initiation of RNA translation (i.e. eiF2,
eiF4 and p70S6K signalling), to DNA damage control
(p53 signalling) and to inflammatory response (CD40
signalling).

Genomic profile of patients who achieved CR
after VTD induction therapy
To complete the high throughput description of the
baseline background of patients who achieved CR after
VTD induction therapy, we finally performed a whole
CNA profile by SNPs array in 89 patients for whom
enough DNA was available.
Overall, the CNA profile confirmed the typical
MM plasma cell distribution of numerical abnormalities
[24–26], where a gain in odd-numbered chromosomes characteristic of so-called hyperdiploid myeloma - was one
of the most frequent CNAs observed (43 samples, 49%),
along with Rb1 CN loss on chr.13q14.2 (detected in
48 patients, 53,9%), CKS1B CN gain on chr.1q32.1
(detected in 28 patients, 31,4%), CDKN2C CN loss on
chr.1p32.3 (detected in 10 patients, 11.2%), and TP53 CN
loss on chr.17p13.1 (detected in 9 patients, 10,1%).

on chr.1p22.1; the same region also included GLMN and
GFI1, both significantly de-regulated in CR patients
(FC = −0.46 and 0.65, respectively; p = 0.001 and
0.05, respectively). Of note, comparison of the abovedescribed transcription profiles between CR and SD/PD
patients showed that two out of the 52 differentially
expressed genes located on chromosome 1, i.e. BCL10
and DPYD, were included within the chromosome
1p22 deletion here described; their position on the
chromosome is respectively telomeric and centromeric
with respect to EVI5 (Figure 1).
Of the LOH events that significantly characterized
CR patients, only one, located on chr.4p16.1 and spanning
1.2Mb, included - among the other genes located within
this region - a putative tumour suppressor gene, CTBP1,
which acts as a transcriptional co-repressor in several
human cancers [27]. This gene is significantly downregulated in CR, as compared to SD/PD patients. Note that
the same cytoband is known to be involved in one of the
most frequent translocations described in MM, i.e. t(4;14)
(p16;q32), though breakpoints on chromosome 4 have
been described as being more centromeric than the abovedescribed LOH event, falling within gene WHSC1, located
on chr.4p16.3 [28].

genomic backgrounds characterize sub-groups of patients,
or even sub-clones within the same patient’s tumour.
The baseline transcriptome analysis has the
advantage of capturing the overall expression profile of the
neoplastic clone (or clones), thus reflecting the status of
plasma cells before any interference by therapy [29]. The
bio-statistical approach employed to achieve this objective
needs to be rigorous and reproducible and it should aim to
obtain signatures that are both highly performing and low
dimensional enough to be employed in common clinical
practice (i.e. in the order of 101 probes). We focused on
this issue by performing discriminant-like analyses on
two-dimensional spaces and subsequently merging the
results obtained into optimal low-dimensional signatures,
with every step controlled by robust cross-validation
(i.e. Leave-One-Out and k-fold cross-validation) [30, 31].
This highly robust procedure produced a 5-gene signature
able both to correctly predict optimum response to VTD
induction in 85% of the patients and to retain a high
predictive power when tested on an independent dataset
(79% and 72% in the IFMII and the APEX/SUMMIT
datasets, respectively). Note that, although validation
of the signature on these different datasets might have
been slightly impaired by the fact that the same chip was
not used to produce the transcriptome profiles (IFM II
dataset), nor were patients treated with exactly the same
combination (though, it was always based on the use of
bortezomib), performances were anyway higher than
previously reported on the same data [32]. This highlights
the power of the statistical algorithm adopted in our study,
arguing the idea that a gene expression profile alone might
be inadequate in predicting the response to therapy [32].
Thus, the predictive power of our statistically defined
signature is high enough to recommend it be employed
for selection of newly diagnosed MM patients who might
achieve CR with VTD induction therapy. One should note
that the observed over-estimation of CR (PPV = 44%, at
best) would be clinically acceptable, since it would not
preclude the possibility of switching from one therapy to
another, should a patient perform badly.

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to provide an expression
signature to be used to predict the attainment of CR in
newly diagnosed MM patients treated up-front with
VTD induction therapy. In addition, we have extensively
and thoroughly described the genetic and the genomic
background of plasma cells obtained at baseline from
patients highly sensitive to VTD front-line therapy.

Definition of a 5-gene signature predictive of
CR to VTD
We found that achievement of CR after primary
induction therapy was an early predictor of prolonged
PFS after ASCT and retained independent prognostic
relevance in a multivariate regression analysis. The
triplet VTD resulted in significant tumour shrinking
in about a quarter of newly diagnosed, ASCT-eligible,
MM patients. This finding suggests that, at the onset of
the disease, there already exists a privileged subgroup of
patients who, irrespective of the most common clinical
baseline characteristics, takes the maximum benefit from
this type of combination therapy and achieves CR. The
possibility of predicting an optimal response to therapy is
the essence of targeted-therapy and enables one to select
those patients who might mostly benefit from a particular
treatment. This is particularly important in MM, since it
is a genetically heterogeneous disease, where peculiar

GEP analysis
As well as correctly identifying, already at diagnosis,
those patients who achieve CR with VTD induction
therapy, it was our objective to describe the molecular
characteristics of this particular subgroup of patients, in
order to understand the basis of their high sensitivity to
this triplet combination. No conventional baseline clinical
features selectively characterize CR patients; similarly,
no so far described genetic lesions, as detected by FISH
analysis, have been shown to univocally correlate with
response to this three-drug regimen. An imbalanced, but
not significant, distribution of chromosomal aberrations
(i.e. del(17p) and/or t(4;14)(p16;q32)) has been observed

among patients stratified according to their response rate
after VTD.
We thus employed high throughput molecular tools
in order to go deeper into this issue and were able to show
that patients who responded to VTD induction therapy
by achieving CR actually displayed both a peculiar
transcription profile and a typical genomic background.
Several pathways proved significantly deregulated in
CR as compared to PR/SD patients, as a consequence
of activation of the different transcriptional programs in
plasma cells observed at diagnosis. Broadly speaking,
two apparently contrasting plasma cell phenotypes
emerged: on the one hand, baseline plasma cells sensitive
to VTD therapy seemed to display a highly proliferative
phenotype, sustained also by the inhibition of proapoptotic pathways; on the other hand, an attenuated
expression of pathways known to negatively impact
on the cross-talk between the MM plasma cells and the
microenvironment could be detected. Of the genes most
significantly deregulated, CCND1 and CCND2 proved
to be mutually exclusive in CR patients, where CCND1
was the more down regulated, CCND2 the more overexpressed gene. These two genes have a critical role in
MM biology [33, 34]: a restricted expression of just one
D cyclin in each MM case has been demonstrated and
cyclin D2 has been shown to be a critical determinant
for cell cycle deregulation and MM progression [34].
Hence, marked de-regulation of these genes may either be
responsible for, or contribute to, the observed alteration
of pathways relating to cell cycle control, apoptosis, and
Wnt signalling regulation. In plasma cells obtained from
CR patients, apoptosis might also be impaired because of
down-regulation of the two pro-apoptotic proteins BAD
and BAX, whereas DKK1 Wnt antagonist down-regulation
strongly suggests impaired Wnt signalling [35]. One notes
that impaired cell cycle control and apoptosis signalling
both point to an aggressive plasma cell phenotype
obtained from CR patients; by contrast, the downmodulation of Wnt signalling outlines a milder scenario,
where lower levels of DKK1 might lessen the possibility
of osteolytic lesion formation [36]. Pathway analysis of
gene profiles characterizing CR plasma cells also showed
that in general the main MM plasma cell growth factor
signalling cascades (i.e. NFkB, IL6R, VEGF and IGF1R
signalling pathways) were differently affected in CR than
in PR/SD samples, as a result of deregulation of several
genes common to these strictly interconnected signalling
cascades. Indeed, altered expression of key regulators of
these pathways (e.g. IGF1R, VEGFB, IL6ST), as well as
of specific factors (oncogene, tumour suppressor genes,
transcription factors, e.g. AKT2, KRAS, PTEN, FOXO3A)
might lead one to expect activation of NFkB, IL6R and
IGF1R pathways, along with down-modulation of the
VEGF pathway.
We thus suggest that the two observed coexisting
aspects of MM plasma cell biology might account for the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CR patients’ tendency after VTD induction therapy to go
through highly efficient clone de-bulking and a decreased
interchange between plasma cells and the local milieu.
Indeed, both these features might lead to establishment
of the CR clinical phase (as assessed by conventional
methods [37]), where the major clone (presumably the
more proliferative ones) has been shrunk, whereas several
putative minor clones (i.e. the minimal residual disease)
might persist and display a milder phenotype, consistent
with prolonged disease control, as commonly observed in
patients who achieve CR.

SNP analysis
A comparable dual scenario emerged from whole
genome analysis of genomic CNAs by means of SNP array
karyotype re-construction. The CNA most commonly
shared by CR patients is CN loss on chromosome 1p22.1,
which includes at least three significantly de-regulated
genes. Deletions on chromosome 1p have been
described as common recurrent genetic events in MM,
with prognostic significance [38, 39]. In particular, the
chromosomal 1p22.1–1p21–3 region represents one of
the 4 minimally altered ones - on chromosome 1p which have been described in MM [40] and are reported
to be slightly associated with impaired OS or PFS in
patients treated with either conventional or thalidomidebased therapy followed by ASCT. The two de-regulated
genes (MTF2 and TMED5) located within this region
have not been reported as carrying any point mutation,
which partly invalidates them as candidate genes for
this chromosomal aberration [38]. Here we showed that
a 606Kb sub-region, included within the 1p22.1-1p21-3
deletion – not including MTF2 and TMED5 - proved
significantly more recurrent in CR samples: of the
20 genes covered by this CN loss, three were significantly
deregulated in CR patients, which carried this deletion,
i.e. EVI5 and GLMN, which were down-regulated and
GFI1, which was over-expressed. EVI5 has been described
as being involved in both cell cycle and cell migration
regulation: in particular it has a role in the completion
of cytokinesis and the safeguarding of genomic integrity
during cell division; thus, silencing of Evi5 resulted in cellcycle arrest and mitotic catastrophe [41]. Both GLMN and
GIF1 were slightly – even if significantly – de-regulated;
GLMN is a cullin ring ligase (CRL) inhibitor, which has
recently been described as having a role in ubiquitination
[42, 43]; one should note that loss of GLMN finally results
in inefficient degradation of Cyclin E and c-Myc, which
in turn leads to genomic instability and cancerogenesis
[43]. GIF1 is a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor
protein with an important role in several hematopoietic
lineages; it particularly affects the correct development
and function of both B- and T-lymphocytes, by interaction
with a number of histone-modifying enzymes [44]. None
of these genes have yet been described as having a specific

role in MM, even though their functions, as well as their
de-regulation in CR samples carrying 1p22.1 deletion, are
in line with the idea that either more aggressive or more
proliferative MM phenotypes are frequently more therapysensitive, thus leading to the achievement of high quality
clinical responses.
On the other hand, plasma cells obtained from CR
patients frequently also harbour an LOH on chromosome
4p16 spanning a region carrying CTBP1, which proves
significantly down-regulated in CR patients. This
transcriptional co-repressor has been reported to be essential
for cell proliferation and cell survival, as being a negative
regulator of important tumour suppressor genes; moreover the
down-regulation of it, mediated by some tumour suppressor,
has been shown to result in p53-independent apoptosis and
reduced tumour cell migration and invasion [27].

of 236 patients who were randomly assigned to the VTD
arm of the GIMEMA-MMY-3006 study (ClinicalTrials
gov. number NCT01134484, EudraCT number 2005003723-39) [8]. Induction therapy comprised three 21day cycles of intravenous bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m2 on days
1, 4, 8 and 11, thalidomide, 100 mg daily for the first
14 days and 200 mg daily thereafter, plus dexamethasone,
40 mg on the day of and the day after each bortezomib
infusion. Baseline clinical and prognostic variables of
these 118 patients were comparable with those of the
general population of patients randomly assigned to
receive VTD induction therapy, with the single exception
of bone marrow plasma cell infiltration, which was higher
in the cohort of molecularly analysed patients (Table 5).

Response definition
Criteria for evaluating response to therapy were
as reported by the European Group for Blood and
Marrow Transplantation [49], with the addition of nCR
(100% reduction in M protein according to electrophoresis,
but immunofixation positive) [50] and VGPR (≥90%
reduction in serum M protein, and less than 100 mg urine
M protein per day) categories [37].

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have shown that newly diagnosed
MM patients may be accurately stratified according to
their sensitivity to VTD induction therapy by means of a
5-gene expression signature. We also showed that patients
who achieve CR after VTD carried at baseline plasma
cells displaying two opposite phenotypes, both possibly
contributing to the sensitivity to VTD induction therapy.
We might speculate that the plasma cells we analysed at
diagnosis were a heterogeneous population, i.e. a mixture
of cells deriving from different clones co-existing in
the same patient. This hypothesis might be consistent
with recent theories on clonal evolution [45–48], and
might actually suggest that these apparently contrasting
behaviours reflected the presence of different sub-clones,
major or minor, co-existing at diagnosis in the same
patients, and fluctuating under the selective pressures
exerted by the therapy. In this perspective, our results
support the current multi-phase therapeutic strategies
employed in MM, suggesting that front-line tumour
shrinking to the point of minimal residual disease, while
being an important step towards disease control, is not
sufficient alone to preserve from relapses: residual disease,
even if clinically undetectable, requires continuous
control, aimed at delaying disease recurrence as much as
possible.

Sample collection, CD138+ cell fraction
enrichment, data generation and quality control
Bone marrow (BM) samples for molecular studies
were obtained during standard diagnostic procedures, after
a written informed consent was provided by each patient.
Plasma cells were purified from mononuclear BM cells
obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation
using anti-CD138 micro beads on an AutoMacs Magnetic
Cell Separator (MACS system, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn,
CA). The purity of positively selected plasma cells was
≥90% in all cases. Total genomic DNA was extracted using
a Maxwell® 16 LEV Blood DNA kit (Promega, Madison,
WI). To measure the concentration and purity of both
nucleic acids, a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
was used (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).
Total RNA was obtained from each sample by the RNeasy®
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) extraction procedure: the
RNeasy® Mini kit was used for more than 5 × 105 cells, the
RNeasy® Micro kit for less than 5 × 105 cells.
Total RNA from purified samples was labelled for
gene expression profiling starting from 100 ng, by means
of the Affymetrix Two-cycle Gene Chip microarray
system. Preparation of DNA single-stranded sense target,
hybridization to HG U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays, and
scanning of the arrays were performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

To determine the differentially expressed genes
between patients who either achieved or failed CR after
VTD induction therapy, the Affymetrix output (CEL files)
were processed by Affymetrix Power Tools with Robust
Multi-Array (RMA) normalization. Quality controls
revealed that no sample needed to be discarded for poor
quality. Samples were further normalized at a global level
by quantile normalization (Mathworks Matlab software)
for subsequent analysis. Differentially expressed genes
between groups with different responses to VTD induction
therapy were then analysed by means of GeneGo® software.
To obtain a low-dimensional gene-based classifier
able to discriminate between CR and non-CR patients on
the basis of their transcription profile, an original method based on Fisher Quadratic Discriminant Analysis - was
employed. This method proved able to obtain optimal
prediction performances in terms of accuracy. The designed
algorithm first compared several small subsets of probe
sets (i.e. all the probe couples trained with Leave-One-Out
cross-validation). From the top-scoring couples (in terms of
classification performance of the dataset) various different
signatures were obtained by means of a network approach
(combining best couples into networks): the best performing
signature was chosen. The optimal signature was tested on
the available dataset by 3-fold cross-validation repeated
1000 times (thus randomly dividing the full dataset into 3
parts, two for training and one for testing): this generated
an exhaustive picture of the overall signature performance,
with a maximum, minimum and median performance over
1000 realizations.
Affymetrix Genotyping Console (GC) was used
to extract the raw DNA copy number (CN) and lossof-heterozygosity (LOH) probability and to evaluate
quality parameters of CEL files according to Affymetrix
guidelines. CEL files were then loaded into Nexus Copy
Number software (professional version 7.5, Biodiscovery,
Hawthorne, CA), which allowed a number of samples to be
analyzed simultaneously, in order to identify common areas
of chromosome aberrations. Data where finally processed
with the BioDiscovery’s Rank Segmentation algorithm, thus
generating a frequency plot. In order to identify statistically
significant differences between sample subgroups, we used
the “comparisons” feature of Nexus, which identified the
CNAs whose frequencies proved significantly different
when comparing various subgroups of patients. Fisher’s
exact test was used to calculate the p-values and the False
Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment was used to correct
for multiple testing. The most significant regions of copy
number changes were annotated.
