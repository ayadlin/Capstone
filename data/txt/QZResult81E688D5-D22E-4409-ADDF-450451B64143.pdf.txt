followed by prostatectomy may improve long-term outcomes for patients with
high-risk localized disease. In addition, this approach provides a paradigm for
evaluating the activity and mechanism of action of new agents as correlative studies are facilitated by the availability of tumor tissue before and after therapy.
The authors determined that a multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists,
urologists, and pathologists is critical to the success of this model. Recent and
ongoing studies of neoadjuvant therapy followed by prostatectomy were
reviewed. Cancer 2007;110:2628–39.  2007 American Cancer Society.

P

rostate cancer (PCa) is the most common noncutaneous malignancy diagnosed in the U.S., with approximately 200,000 cases
and 30,000 deaths reported every year.1 With the advent of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) screening, PCa is detected commonly when it
is localized. Adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) after
radiotherapy or surgery improves outcomes in men with early highrisk PCa.2,3 However, a significant number of patients still progress
and die of metastatic disease. Prolonged ADT for patients with biochemical PSA-only disease has deleterious effects on quality of life
and bone health.4 In advanced, metastatic PCa, ADT is effective in
improving outcomes. However, progression to hormone-refractory
PCa (HRPC) is inevitable.5 In addition, with the early institution of
ADT for PSA-only progression, there is a growing population with
biochemical hormone-resistant disease in the absence of detectable
metastatic disease. These patients appear to have a more indolent
course and could benefit from novel noncytotoxic and tolerable
options.6 Beyond hormone therapy, treatment options are limited,
and only docetaxel chemotherapy has demonstrated a modest
improvement in the survival of patients with metastatic HRPC.7,8
Clearly, there is a need for effective and tolerable systemic therapy
for all stages of PCa. The ability to evaluate agents in patients with
PSA-only disease is limited by the unreliability of the PSA as a surrogate. For this report, we reviewed studies evaluating neoadjuvant

therapy before radical prostatectomy and assessed
this paradigm for assisting in the development of
new systemic therapies for PCa. Studies that use
radiotherapy as the definitive local therapy were not
reviewed, specifically because radiotherapy does not
permit a thorough pathologic assessment of the
entire prostate organ.

Neoadjuvant Therapy as a Paradigm to Develop
Systemic Therapy
Neoadjuvant therapy permits the in vivo assessment
of tumor response and induces pathologic downstaging in several malignancies. The down-staging/
down-sizing of localized malignancy also may facilitate complete surgical resection. Because pathologic
complete response (pCR) and biologic activity can be
determined rapidly after surgery, the efficacy of a
systemic regimen is evident with a relatively small
number of patients before long-term follow-up.
Neoadjuvant therapy may be more feasible than adjuvant therapy because of slow postoperative recovery in some patients and, thus, may benefit more
patients. Extrapolating from other malignancies (eg,
bladder) in which pCR correlates with improved clinical outcomes, neoadjuvant therapy for PCa may provide powerful prognostic assessment.9 Therefore,
although the long-term objective of neoadjuvant
therapy is to improve outcomes for high-risk localized cancer, this paradigm has the potential to
accelerate the pace of systemic therapy development.
It also may be possible to determine molecular and
biologic characteristics that predict for sensitivity.
However, there are some counterpoints to bear
in mind when considering neoadjuvant therapy. One
caveat is that activity in early hormone-naive PCa
may not translate into efficacy in other stages. It is
unclear whether clones of hormone-refractory cells
exist initially or develop after the initiation of androgen ablation because of selection pressure. In addition, precise pathologic stage is not available before
surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy may complicate surgery and increase the risk of postoperative complications. A malignancy that is resistant to the
neoadjuvant agent potentially may progress because
of delay of surgery. A recent study questions the
reliability of standard histologic evaluation. Namely,
after neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT), immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) has uncovered persistent tumor cells, positive margins, and
capsular penetration that were missed by routine histology.10 The prognostic value of persistent malignant
cells by immunohistochemistry is unknown.

2629

Selection of Candidates for Neoadjuvant Therapy
Ideally, the patient selection criteria of a particular
protocol require consideration of the endpoint of the
study design. Early phase study designs aimed primarily at evaluating a pharmacodynamic endpoint
should be focused more on enriching for patient
characteristics that would ensure expression of the
particular biomarker and/or adequate malignant tissue for correlative analyses, whereas later phase studies with clinical endpoints would select patients
based on their clinical risk profile, as determined by
validated prognostic markers. A high-risk population
of patients with localized PCa is likely to benefit
optimally from effective neoadjuvant therapy. Highrisk patients commonly have been identified as those
with a high T classification, Gleason score. or PSA.
However, trials have used heterogeneous definitions
of high-risk disease that render across-trials comparisons difficult (Tables 1–3). A preoperative nomogram that incorporates clinical T classification,
serum PSA, and biopsy Gleason grade has been validated independently and externally (with a concordance index of 0.79) and enhances prediction of the
risk of PSA recurrence and selection of a relatively
homogeneous population.11,12 The percentage of
cancer in biopsy cores and the number of positive
biopsy cores, as well as the incorporation of biomarkers (serum interleukin 6 [IL-6]-soluble receptor and
transforming growth factor b-1) may improve further
its predictive accuracy.13 Although a relatively high
threshold of PSA recurrence to determine eligibility
is reasonable, it may have a negative impact on
accrual. In addition, investigators may consider that
such high-risk patients are treated optimally by
radiotherapy instead of prostatectomy. Conversely,
setting a lower threshold of recurrence may treat
more patients unnecessarily, reduce the event rate,
and increase the number of patients required. It may
be reasonable to hypothesize that patients with a
relatively high risk of recurrence may be optimal
candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy, whereas
those with a lower risk of recurrence may be optimal
candidates for more tolerable biologic agents and
immunotherapy.

and urethral margin involvement (6% vs 17%). However, the 5-year PSA recurrence rate (>0.4 ng/mL)
was similar (approximately 65%), suggesting that
there was no significant effect on systemic micrometastatic disease. There also was no difference
between the groups in operating time, blood loss, or
postoperative morbidities. Schulman et al. reported a
randomized study of 402 patients with T2 or T3 disease
who underwent prostatectomy or 3 months of goserelin plus flutamide followed by prostatectomy.15 Significantly fewer positive margins were observed in the
NHT group. In the subset of patients with T2 disease,
local recurrence was lower in the NHT group (3% vs
11%; P 5.03). However, the PSA progression rates were
similar. Aus et al. reported similar data in a study of 126
patients who were randomized to radical prostatectomy either alone or with a 3-month course of an

LHRH analogue before surgery.16 Positive surgical margins were significantly less prevalent in the NHT arm
(45.5% vs 23.6%) without a difference in 7-year PSA
progression-free survival (approximately 50%).

margins (12% vs 23%; P 5 .01), pathologic T2 stage
(80% vs 68%; P 5 .002), and pCR rate (9.3% vs 5.1%;
P 5 .07) were superior in the 8-month group. Prostate volume measured by transrectal ultrasound decreased 37% with 3 months of NHT and decreased
an additional 13% with 8 months of NHT (P 5 .03),
suggesting the utility of imaging as a surrogate for
biologic activity of hormone therapy. Selli et al. randomized 393 patients to either surgery alone or 12 or
24 weeks of NHT.20 NHT for 24 weeks appeared to
be more active, increased the proportion of patients
with organ-confined disease, and decreased the positive margin rate. Despite evidence for increased biologic activity with prolonged NHT, no improvement
in long-term clinical outcomes has been reported to
date in either of the studies described above. These
studies generally were underpowered and were performed in a broad range of patients, including men
with low-risk and intermediate-risk disease.

Neoadjuvant 5- a reductase inhibition
To identify molecular changes in normal prostate tissue associated with 5-a reductase inhibition, gene
expression changes were profiled in benign prostate
epithelia from patients with PCa who received
neoadjuvant dutasteride (DT).21 Men with localized,
low-risk PCa were randomized to either prostatectomy alone (n 5 25 patients) or neoadjuvant oral DT
at a dose of 0.5 mg (n 5 26 patients) or 3.5 mg (n 5
24 patients) daily for 4 months (Table 3). DT reduced
tissue dihydrotestosterone levels by approximately
95% and increased tissue testosterone levels. Gene
profiling showed significant changes in gene expression consistent with androgen inhibition. Another
randomized Phase II trial at the University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) is evaluating neoadjuvant finasteride for 6 weeks compared
with placebo with a primary endpoint of tumor tissue molecular changes (Table 4). The Reduction by
Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events chemoprevention trial evaluating DT is ongoing.

Neoadjuvant Combination Hormone
Therapy and Chemotherapy
No data have emerged definitively supporting the
use of neoadjuvant chemohormone therapy. In some
cases, declines in tumor volume have been reported.
However, the studies do provide evidence of feasibility and reinforce the need for new agents to treat
PCa.
Preclinical evidence
Optimal sequencing of chemotherapy and hormone
therapy for PCa is unclear. Mice xenografts that were
administered concurrent paclitaxel and castration
demonstrated improved outcomes compared with
mice that received sequential therapy.22 In addition,
initial paclitaxel induced an attenuated response to
subsequent castration. Several genes known to play a
role in androgen independence were up-regulated in
response to paclitaxel. Conflicting findings were
reported in another study that evaluated concurrent
and different sequences of docetaxel and androgen
ablation in xenografts.23 The greatest growth delay
and apoptosis were observed with docetaxel followed
by castration. Castration followed by docetaxel pro-

duced the least antitumor activity. With singlemodality therapy, Bax to Bcl-2 ratios decreased significantly after castration (suggesting apoptosis
resistance), whereas this ratio remained high after
docetaxel treatment (favoring apoptosis).

Combination ADT plus chemotherapy (Table 1)
A Phase II trial by Pettaway et al. recruited 33 highrisk patients and administered 12 weeks of ketoconazole plus doxorubicin alternating with vinblastine,
estramustine, and combination ADT followed by
prostatectomy.24 Manageable postoperative complications occurred in 33% of patients. Of 30 patients,
33% had organ-confined disease, 70% had extraprostatic extension, 37% had positive lymph nodes, and
17% exhibited positive surgical margins. All patients
achieved an undetectable PSA postoperatively, and
20 of 29 patients were free of recurrence with a median follow-up of 13 months. No pCR was observed,
and the authors reported that they believed the
neoadjuvant approach was feasible.
Konety et al. reported a Phase II study of 36
patients who received 4 cycles of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and estramustine plus goserelin acetate.25

Neoadjuvant Therapy Preprostatectomy/Sonpavde et al.

Clinical stage was reduced in 39% of patients and
was greater in 36%, and pCR was not observed. Deep
vein thrombosis occurred in 22% of patients. The
positive margin rate was 22%, and 45% of patients
remained free from PSA recurrence after a median
follow-up of 29 months.
A recent study by the CUOG evaluated weekly
docetaxel (35 mg/m2 weekly for 6 of 8 weeks 33
cycles) plus combination ADT for localized, high-risk
disease.26 The trial attempted to detect a pCR rate of
interest of 20% as opposed to a poor pCR rate of
5%. In total, 72 patients were enrolled (significantly
more than the 41 required), and 64 patients were
evaluable. Four patients discontinued therapy
because of adverse events. Two patients (3%) displayed a pCR, and 18 patients (28%) had 5% tumor
volume in the prostatectomy specimen. After a median follow-up of 42.7 months, there have been 19
recurrences (30%). Gleason score >7, pathologic T3
classification, and a preoperative PSA level >0.33 ng/
mL were associated negatively with PSA recurrencefree survival on univariate analysis. This compared
favorably to the results from the CUOG randomized
study of 3 months versus 8 months of NHT. In that
study, 97 of 502 patients had high-risk disease (clinical stage T3, PSA >20 ng/mL, and/or Gleason score
8); and, after a mean follow-up of 37.7 months,
PSA recurrence occurred in 52.6%.

Estramustine phosphate-containing neoadjuvant
chemotherapy without LHRH analogue
Because estramustine phosphate (EMP) induces biochemical castration caused by its estrogenic activity,
it may be appropriate to consider estramustine-containing chemotherapy as a subcategory of chemohormone therapy.27 Neoadjuvant EMP resulted in a
significant decrease in positive surgical margins in
patients with T2b disease in a randomized trial.28
Hussain et al. treated 21 patients with 3 to 6 cycles
of docetaxel plus EMP followed by radiation or prostatectomy.29 In that study, 10 patients underwent
prostatectomy, and 11 patients underwent radiotherapy. Of the 10 patients who underwent prostatectomy, 7 patients achieved negative surgical margins.
Of the 11 patients who received radiation, 2 patients
displayed negative preradiotherapy biopsies. At a median follow-up of 13.1 months, 71% of all patients
revealed no evidence of disease. Clark et al. evaluated 3 cycles of EMP plus etoposide in 18 patients.30
Organ-confined disease was observed in 31% of
patients, and residual carcinoma with androgen-deprivation effect was observed universally. Generally,
EMP-based chemotherapy has been abandoned

2633

because of toxicities, especially thromboembolism
(Table 1).

Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Without Hormone Therapy
Docetaxel
The use of neoadjuvant, short-course, high-dose docetaxel has been reported by Dreicer et al. in 29
patients with high-risk, localized disease.31 Six doses
of weekly docetaxel at 40 mg/m2 were administered
with a primary endpoint of feasibility. Eighty percent
of patients completed all 6 weeks of therapy, and
97% underwent surgery. Of the 29 patients, 79%
experienced a reduction (24% exhibited reductions
>50%) and 21% experienced an increase in PSA after
docetaxel, all with unchanged testosterone levels. No
unexpected toxicities and no pCR were observed.
Twenty men were free of recurrence after a median
follow-up of 23 months. Another Phase II study of 19
men at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute evaluated
weekly docetaxel (36 mg/m2 for up to 6 months).32
No pCR was observed, although the regimen was tolerable. Tumor volume measured by endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reduced 25% in
13 patients (68%) and 50% in 4 patients (21%).
Gene expression analyses revealed the up-regulation
of genes involved in androgen metabolism. There
were PSA decreases 50% in 11 of 19 patients (58%)
(Table 2).
Docetaxel combination chemotherapy
Garzotto et al. reported a Phase I/II trial with neoadjuvant docetaxel plus mitoxantrone.33 In that study,
22 men with high-risk, clinically localized PCa
received weekly docetaxel (35 mg/m2) with increasing doses of mitoxantrone (2-5 mg/m2) for a 12 of
16-week treatment cycle before undergoing prostatectomy. Testosterone levels were maintained, and
PSA reductions were observed in 95% of patients
(median reduction, 41%). Negative surgical margins
were attained in 76% of patients, but no pCR was
observed. Docetaxel increased the activity of thymidine phosphorylase, which activates capecitabine to
5-fluorouracil, providing a rationale for its combination with capecitabine. Combination docetaxel and
capecitabine was feasible without attaining a pCR.34
These studies demonstrated the activity of docetaxel
alone or in combination for patients with hormonenaive disease, and the results support further evaluation in this clinical state.

therapy (45 grays) plus docetaxel chemotherapy followed by radical prostatectomy in a Phase I/II trial.
Eligible patients include those with T2b and resectable T3 disease and with either PSA 15 ng/mL or
Gleason score 4 1 3. This trial is predicated on the
importance of local recurrence and extrapolation
from other malignancies, such as rectal cancer, in
which this strategy has enhanced outcomes. Approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo radical prostatectomy.
The trial also incorporates correlative studies including serum biomarkers and tumor gene expression
profiles.

Novel Agents and Regimens
Several Phase II trials have been reported or are
being conducted using novel agents with or without
ADT with feasibility and clinical/pathologic and/or
correlative endpoints (Tables 3, 4). Most of these
trials use variable high-risk criteria of high T classification, Gleason score, and PSA and do not use the
nomogram.
Regimens that target growth factor signaling pathways
Neoadjuvant docetaxel plus gefitinib (epidermal
growth factor receptor [EGFR]-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) was evaluated based on preclinical data and was
established as feasible in a Phase II trial that used
pCR as the primary endpoint.35 Nine of 17 patients
exhibited radiographic improvement on endorectal
MRI, although no pCR was observed. The EGFR
monoclonal antibody cetuximab is being evaluated,
either alone or in combination with docetaxel, with
correlative and efficacy endpoints (Table 4). Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus and sirolimus) are being evaluated in primarily
correlative studies (Table 4). Imatinib mesylate is a
specific inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including Bcr-Abl, c-Kit, and platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) receptor. Because of high rates of expression
of PDGF receptor in PCa, neoadjuvant studies with
imatinib either alone or in combination with docetaxel and ADT are in progress (Table 4). Preliminary
gene expression and immunohistochemistry analyses
have revealed the biologic activity of 6 weeks of
neoadjuvant imatinib alone in terms of markers of
apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells.36 On the
basis of preliminary activity in several malignancies
and the presence of respective targets in PCa, Canadian investigators at the Prostate Center in Vancouver General Hospital and at the British Columbia
Cancer Agency in Vancouver are investigating enzastaurin (a protein kinase C [Akt] inhibitor with inhibitory activity against vascular endothelial growth

factor [VEGF] and Akt) and a monoclonal antibody
to insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (CP-751871)
in separate trials by evaluating target modulation
(Table 4).37,38 The primary objective of that study is
to provide proof of principle for the biologic activity
of these agents at their clinically derived Phase II
dosing schedules.

Immune modulation
Granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates
dendritic cells. Administration of GM-CSF plus thalidomide induced PSA responses in 23% of patients
with HRPC.39 In a Phase II neoadjuvant trial, men
with localized, high-risk PCa received GM-CSF at 250
lg subcutaneously 3 times weekly and thalidomide
escalated to 200 mg per day for a maximum of 8
weeks (Table 3).40 The objectives were to evaluate
PSA and pathologic response and to perform correlative tumor tissue studies. A PSA decline of 20%
occurred in 19 of 24 patients, and some decline
occurred in 79% of patients. Therapy was tolerated
well and induced infiltration of dendritic cells and T
cells in cancer tissue, but no pCR was reported. An
ongoing trial at the University of California-San Francisco is evaluating GM-CSF alone for 4 weeks followed by prostatectomy within 3 days of the last
dose and is using immune reaction in tumor tissue
as a primary endpoint (Table 4). MDACC is planning
a trial of a CTLA-4-targeting monoclonal antibody
(to up-regulate the antitumor T-cell immune
response) in combination with ADT.
Angiogenesis inhibitors
VEGF expression appears to be a poor prognostic
factor in PCa.41,42 The Dana Farber Cancer Institute
is evaluating efficacy and modulation of targets with
neoadjuvant docetaxel plus bevacizumab (Avastin;
Genentech), a monoclonal antibody against VEGF
(Table 4). Sunitinib malate (Sutent; Pfizer Inc.) is an
orally administered, small-molecule, multitargeted
kinase inhibitor with selectivity for PDGF receptors,
VEGF receptors, Flt3, and Kit that was approved
recently for metastatic renal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.43,44 A Phase I/II trial at the
University of California-Los Angeles is evaluating
neoadjuvant sunitinib alone primarily to evaluate
the modulation of molecular targets, whereas the
MDACC is evaluating ADT plus sunitinib with clinical
outcome/efficacy (pCR and time to progression) as
the primary endpoint (Table 4).
MDACC reported a Phase 1/II study of neoadjuvant thalidomide (200-600 mg per day for up to 12
weeks in 18 men), an agent with antiangiogenic and

Neoadjuvant Therapy Preprostatectomy/Sonpavde et al.

antiproliferative properties (Table 2).45 The efficacy
endpoint was PSA response with a focus on correlative studies. A median reduction in PSA of 41% was
observed without a decline in testosterone levels. Fifteen treated patients and 15 untreated controls were
compared to assess effects on the tumor microenvironment. Tissue microarray analyses indicated modulation of vascular marker expression accompanied by
a reduction in microvessel density. Comparison of
stromal-epithelial interaction markers suggested a
transition to a less aggressive phenotype. The ratio of
matrix metalloproteinases to E-cadherin shifted to
favor E-cadherin. However, no differences were noted
in proliferation or apoptosis.

Other agents
Bortezomib (Velcade; Millennium Pharmaceuticals)
is a proteasome inhibitor that has been approved for
myeloma and has some evidence of biologic (inhibition of nuclear factor-jB-related markers) and antitumor activity in HRPC.46 The Baylor College of
Medicine is evaluating 4 weeks of bortezomib followed by prostatectomy within 72 hours of the last
dose of bortezomib in a Phase II trial with primarily
correlative endpoints (Table 4). Northwestern University is evaluating oral genistein, a soy isoflavone with
antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties (Table
4).47 On the basis of antiproliferative effects against
PCa, the Roswell Park Cancer Institute is evaluating
calcitriol plus dexamethasone followed by prostatectomy within 48 hours (Table 4). The Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center is investigating suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (vorinostat), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, with a similar objective of detecting
target modulation (Table 4). In preclinical systems,
vorinostat induced a decrease in androgen receptor
(AR) messenger RNA and protein with a corresponding decrease in levels of PSA, an AR-regulated gene.48
Clusterin is a cytoprotective chaperone protein
that promotes cell survival and confers broadspectrum treatment resistance. OGX-011 is a secondgeneration, methoxy-ethyl-modified, phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide that is complementary
to clusterin messenger RNA that inhibits clusterin
expression and has preclinical antitumor efficacy. A
Phase I study of neoadjuvant OGX-011 was conducted to determine a biologically effective dose
that would inhibit clusterin expression (Table 3).49
Twenty-five men with localized, high-risk PCa
received OGX-011 by 2-hour intravenous infusion on
Days 1, 3, and 5 and then weekly from Days 8
through 29 combined with ADT. This was followed
by prostatectomy within 7 days of the last dose of
OGX-011. OGX-011 plasma and prostate tissue con-

2635

centrations were measured, and the pharmacokinetics of OGX-011 were determined. OGX-011 was
tolerated well, and the quantity in prostate tissue
increased with dose to biologically effective concentrations accompanied by decreases in clusterin
expression. The apoptotic index of PCa cells was
increased significantly in a dose-dependent fashion
and compared with historic controls. Thus, the
neoadjuvant design of this study allowed for a proofof-principle demonstration of the biologic effectiveness of OGX-011 and established dosing for future
Phase II studies.
Lycopene, the major carotenoid in tomatoes,
appears to be associated inversely with the risk of
PCa. A Phase II randomized clinical trial of lycopene
supplementation was conducted in 26 men (Table 3).50
Endpoints in that trial included both correlative studies and clinical/pathologic parameters. There were
negative surgical margins in 11 of 15 men in the lycopene arm but in only 2 of 11 men in the untreated
group (P 5 .02). High-grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia was present in 10 men (67%) in the intervention group and in all 11 men (100%) in the control
group (P 5 .05). PSA decreased by 18% in the intervention group and increased by 14% in the control
group (P 5 .25). Tumor markers of differentiation
and apoptosis (bcl-2, bax) were unaltered. Increased
expression of connexin-43, a putative tumor suppressor gene, in tumor tissue in the intervention group,
although it did not reach statistical significance, was
deemed to have mechanistic importance. The results
from this study suggest that lycopene may have biologic activity against PCa.
Celecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2
inhibitor that modulates PSA kinetics in biochemically recurrent, hormone-naive disease. A study of 45
patients with localized PCa randomized patients to
receive 4 weeks of celecoxib 400 mg twice daily versus no drug before prostatectomy and evaluated the
modulation of tumor tissue biomarkers (Table 3).51
The celecoxib group had significantly lower levels f
MIB-1 (proliferation marker) expression and had
nonsignificantly lower levels of microvessel density,
VEGF, VEGF receptor 2, hypoxia-inducible factor 1
(hypoxia marker), and COX-2.

Intraprostatic delivery of gene therapy
INGN 201 (adenoviral [Ad] p53) is a replicationdefective adenoviral vector that encodes a wild-type
p53 gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter
and has activity against human PCa.52 MDACC conducted a study to determine the safety of neoadjuvant INGN 201 in patients with high-risk, localized
PCa (Table 3). INGN 201 was administered by intra-

2636

CANCER

December 15, 2007 / Volume 110 / Number 12

prostatic injection as 3 administrations given 2 weeks
apart. Biopsies at baseline and 24 hours after the first
administration were assessed for p53 protein and apoptosis. There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events.
Of 11 patients who had negative baseline p53 expression, 10 patients expressed p53 after the first administration of INGN 201, and 8 patients had increased
apoptosis. However, no pCR or PSA responses were
observed.
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that intratumoral delivery of adenovirus (AdCA)-expressing IL2 eradicates tumors and confers immune protection.
To explore the activity of AdCA/IL-2 in PCa, a Phase
I clinical trial was conducted in patients with localized, high-risk disease (Table 3).53 Twelve patients
were injected 4 weeks before prostatectomy in a
dose-escalation study. No dose-limiting toxicity was
observed. Side effects included perineal discomfort,
hematuria, flu-like symptoms in 2 patients, and urinary hesitancy. Pathology demonstrated an inflammatory response consisting predominantly of CD3positive/CD8-positive T lymphocytes with areas of
tumor necrosis. Increases in both g-interferon and
IL-4-secreting T cells were observed. In another
small, neoadjuvant Phase I trial, a DNA-lipid complex encoding the IL-2 gene was administered intraprostatically.54 Evidence of immune activation was
observed based on an increase in T-cell infiltration
that was observed in tissue from the injected tumor
sites and increased proliferation of peripheral blood
lymphocytes cocultured with patient serum.

Selection of Endpoints With Neoadjuvant Therapy
in Phase II trials
The optimal primary endpoint in Phase II trials of
neoadjuvant therapy has not been established. With
novel agents used alone, feasibility and target modulations have been used commonly as primary endpoints with other secondary clinical and pathologic
endpoints. In breast cancer, neoadjuvant, short-duration, biologic agent therapy with trastuzumab alone
in HER-2-expressing breast cancer has induced apoptosis without inducing any pCR.55 Improved longterm clinical outcomes in both the adjuvant and
metastatic breast cancer settings have occurred by
combining trastuzumab with chemotherapy. Other
evidence for biologic activity includes increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation and angiogenesis
markers. However, such pathologic surrogates are
unvalidated, not necessarily reliable measures of biologic activity, and the threshold of biologic activity
that is predictive of improved clinical outcomes is
unclear. With combination regimens of novel agents
and conventional therapy, efficacy (pCR, time to pro-

gression) has been the usual primary endpoint. pCR
is an excellent surrogate for long-term outcomes in
other malignancies and is an attractive primary endpoint. However, it also appears that pCR is a difficult
endpoint to attain in PCa, and the optimal pCR rate
that is predictive for improved clinical outcomes is
unclear (a pCR rate of 5%-10% with NHT has not
translated into improved long-term outcomes). With
the discovery of novel agents that target important
molecules, pCR or other pathologic endpoints may
emerge as useful surrogates for long-term outcomes.
Achieving significant necrosis without pCR may be
sufficient to predict improved outcomes. An evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy for high-grade extremity
soft tissue sarcomas revealed that patients who had
<95% pathologic necrosis were significantly more
likely to develop local recurrence and die of their disease compared with patients who had 95% pathologic necrosis.56 In addition, patients with soft tissue
sarcomas that displayed any radiographic response
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy had better clinical
outcomes.57 Imaging endpoints, including endorectal
MRI and positron emission tomography, are being
explored in the setting of PCa. A prolonged time to
PSA failure and/or clinical failure may be used as an
endpoint to support further development of a regimen (and to correlate with pCR/biologic activity).
However, this may negate the prime advantage of the
neoadjuvant model, ie, early determination of activity
with pathologic and biologic endpoints. In addition,
the utility of time to progression in a Phase II trial is
suspect.
The choice of novel agents should be based on
the knowledge of potential molecular targets emerging from studies that examine PCa biology. With
novel agents in early Phase I/II neoadjuvant trials,
the focus should be primarily on pharmacodynamics
(biologic activity) with a validated assay from the
laboratory. If biologic activity is demonstrated in initial small pilot trials (eg, 15-25 patients with appropriate statistical design to detect a biologic effect),
then additional larger Phase II studies of novel
agents alone or in combination, potentially using
randomized Phase II designs, may be planned with
more stringent efficacy endpoints and with the additional goal of discovering markers that are predictive
for efficacy, including global gene expression assays.
The optimal go/no-go criteria to select a regimen for
further development in a large randomized trial have
not been defined or validated; however, data from
ongoing Phase III trials of neoadjuvant therapy (see
below) potentially may help define these endpoints
for future trials. Consideration of a treatment regimen’s effect in more advanced disease also requires

Neoadjuvant Therapy Preprostatectomy/Sonpavde et al.

consideration in the go/no-go decision process of
embarking on a randomized trial in this patient
group, which necessitates a large sample size and
prolonged follow-up. In the meantime, Phase II
neoadjuvant studies should incorporate multiple
endpoint parameters: pCR as a stringent criterion
(perhaps with interest in a threshold pCR rate of
10%-15%, depending on the patient-selection criteria), PSA nadir before surgery, PSA recurrence-free
survival, and pathologic assessments of both target
effects and biologic activity (such as apoptosis index,
proliferation index, etc, depending on the mechanism of action).

Ongoing Randomized Studies of Neoadjuvant Therapy
Preceding Prostatectomy
The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) is conducting a critically important Phase III randomized
trial (CALGB-90,203) to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with leuprolide acetate plus 6 cycles
of docetaxel every 3 weeks before radical prostatectomy (compared with prostatectomy alone), and the
Southwest Oncology Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group recently have joined the trial.
Eligibility criteria include localized disease (T1-T3a,
lymph nodes >1 cm allowed only if negative by biopsy) with a nomogram-predicted probability of
60% freedom from PSA recurrence at 5 years.
Within 60 days after the completion of therapy,
patients undergo prostatectomy. The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival, and the accrual goal
is 750 patients.
Urogenital Tumor Study Group-12 is a similar,
ongoing, randomized, European multicenter study.
Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (7
vs >7), T classification (T1/T2 vs T3 or T4), PSA (20
ng/mL vs >20 ng/mL), and lymph node involvement
(N0 vs N1/N2). Patients receive combination ADT
with or without 4 cycles of docetaxel plus estramustine followed at least 3 weeks later by definitive local
therapy with prostatectomy or radiotherapy for N0
disease and by radiation or no definitive local therapy for lymph node-positive disease. ADT continues
in both arms for 3 years in the absence of disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Conclusions and Future Directions
NHT before radical prostatectomy improves pathologic outcomes without a demonstrated benefit on
survival. Phase III trials will address whether or not
combination chemotherapy and hormone therapy
improves outcomes. Neoadjuvant therapy may provide an important paradigm for the discovery of
active agents for the therapy of PCa in addition to

2637

improving clinical outcomes for men with early,
high-risk disease. The availability of pretherapy and
posttherapy tumor specimens enables the determination of biologic and pathologic antitumor activity
with a relatively small number of patients. Although
pCR cannot be determined reliably after neoadjuvant
therapy preceding radiotherapy, it may be feasible to
perform tumor tissue correlative studies with a preradiation biopsy. A multidisciplinary approach with a
team of oncologists and urologists will be critical to
making advances in the arena of neoadjuvant therapy for PCa and aiding in the efficient evaluation of
new therapies.
