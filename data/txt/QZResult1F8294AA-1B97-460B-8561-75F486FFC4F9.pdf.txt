ABSTRACT
More than 40 years ago, we discovered that novel transplantation antigens can
be induced in vivo or in vitro by treating murine leukemia with dacarbazine. Years
later, this phenomenon that we called “Chemical Xenogenization” (CX) and more
recently, “Drug-Induced Xenogenization” (DIX), was reproduced by Thierry Boon with
a mutagenic/carcinogenic compound (i.e. N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine).
In both cases, the molecular bases of DIX rely on mutagenesis induced by methyl
adducts to oxygen-6 of DNA guanine. In the present review we illustrate the main
DIX-related immune-pharmacodynamic properties of triazene compounds of clinical
use (i.e. dacarbazine and temozolomide).
In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has come back to the stage with the
discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICpI) that show an extraordinary immuneenhancing activity. Here we illustrate the salient biochemical features of some of the
most interesting ICpI and the up-to-day status of their clinical use. Moreover, we
illustrate the literature showing the direct relationship between somatic mutation
burden and susceptibility of cancer cells to host’s immune responses.
When DIX was discovered, we were not able to satisfactorily exploit the possible
presence of triazene-induced neoantigens in malignant cells since no device was
available to adequately enhance host’s immune responses in clinical settings. Today,
ICpI show unprecedented efficacy in terms of survival times, especially when elevated
mutation load is associated with cancer cells. Therefore, in the future, mutationdependent neoantigens obtained by appropriate pharmacological intervention appear
to disclose a novel approach for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of ICpI in cancer
patients.

INTRODUCTION

termed “chemical xenogenization”(CX) based on
analogous definition proposed by Hiroshi Kobayashi
in 1969 describing the presence of transplantation Ags
induced by Friend virus infection in rat tumors (i.e. “viral
xenogenization”, [2]).
After about 15 years of investigations (reviewed
in [3]), CX was slowly relegated to oblivion. This was
probably due to the lack of instruments that could translate

More than 40 years ago we showed, for the first
time, that in vivo treatment of leukemia bearing mice
with the antitumor agent dacarbazine (dimethyltriazeneimidazole-4-carboxamide, DTIC) was able to induce the
appearance of novel transplantation antigens (Ags) in
malignant cells [1]. This phenomenon was successively

into clinical benefits the appearance of drug-induced
neoantigens in patients essentially unable to mount an
adequate antitumor immune response.
Few years ago a monoclonal antibody (mAb),
Ipilimumab, came to the worldwide attention as a
potent inducer of cell-mediated immunity through
down-regulation of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen-4
(CTLA-4)-mediated T cell suppression [4]. In particular,
Ipilimumab was found to substantially increase the
survival of patients with advanced melanoma, essentially
resistant to classical antitumor drugs. Therefore, on
March 25th, 2011 the US Food and Drug Administration
approved Ipilimumab for the management of advanced
melanoma. This approval was a landmark event in the
history of cancer immunotherapy, since for the first time
an unusually potent amplifier of T cell-mediated cytotoxic
responses was available to oncologists.
This event and the successive appearance in the
cancer immunotherapy scenario of a growing number
of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICpI, reviewed in [5,
6]) have provided the ground to bring CX back to life.
There is no doubt that drug-induced neoantigens could
be considered novel “pharmacologically driven” targets
of amplified host’s antitumor T-cell responses with great
potential therapeutic value.
Up to now, the remarkable progress that has been
made in the development of antitumor targeted therapy
has not provided a concrete answer to long-term cancer
control, especially in solid malignancies. From antiinfective therapy we have learned that, in the absence of
adequate host’s immune responses, no cure can be attained
in spite of the use of insuperably “targeted” agents (e.g.
penicillin) in immuno-compromised patients. Therefore,
the (re)appearance on the scene of successfully active
anti-tumor immunity have disclosed novel and exciting
perspectives in cancer management.

or xenogeneic cells [8]. In no case, leukemic cells
passaged in untreated nude mice became immunogenic
for euthymic histocompatible hosts. On the other hand,
DTIC treatment of leukemia-bearing nude mice generated
highly immunogenic sublines similar to those obtainable
in conventional euthymic hosts [8].
In order to consolidate the concept that triazenes
induce novel non-preexisting Ags, tolerance studies in
vivo were performed in BALB/c mice challenged with
the Moloney-Leukemia-Virus-induced lymphoma cell
line LSTRA, positive for virus-derived Ags. The results
showed that mice rendered tolerant to the Ags of the
LSTRA cell line, were able to reject DTIC-treated but not
untreated LSTRA cells [9].
The final molecular evidence showing that CX
is the result of induction of novel Ags was obtained by
Grohmann et al. in the 1990s. Through an original and
highly accurate investigation [10], the authors were able
to identify mutated peptides derived from endogenous
retroviral env sequences detectable in the immunogenic
“D” clone originated from xenogenized L5178Y/DTIC
cell line. No similar mutated peptides were found in
parental, non-xenogenized cells. Transfection experiments
showed that products of mutated env gp70 subgenic
fragments render target cells susceptible to lysis by
D-cell primed, H-2Kd or H-2Ld-restricted cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL, [10]).
In collaboration with Michel Moore’s group,
D’Atri et al. carried out a series of investigations in order
to establish whether CX could be induced in human
neoplasms [11]. The human lung cancer cell line H-125,
treated with an in vitro active triazene for a number of
cycles, was co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear
cells of a healthy donor to generate allo-CTL. Thereafter,
selected CTL clones able to specifically kill triazenetreated cells but not parental cells were identified. This
study supported the hypothesis that CX could be generated
also in human tumor cells. However, since no detailed
analysis was performed in order to identify possible HLA
restriction elements, these results appear to be incomplete
and require further investigations.

DRUG-INDUCED APPEARANCE OF
NON-PREEXISTING
TUMOR
AGS
UNDERLIES CX PHENOMENON
Evidence that in vivo treatment with triazene
compounds (hereafter referred to as triazenes)
including DTIC, is able to induce the appearance of
novel transplantations Ags required a long series of
investigations.
It was demonstrated that the high doses of DTIC and
of the other imidazole or aryltriazenes utilized to induce
CX, inhibit severely T-cell dependent graft responses in
mice [7]. Therefore, it was necessary to rule out that CX
could be due to the emergence of immunogenic sublines
in mice immunodepressed by triazenes, and therefore
not competent to suppress spontaneously developing
immunogenic clones. Two leukemia cell lines were
passaged in untreated or DTIC-treated athymic H-2d/H2d nu/nu BALB/c mice not able to reject allogeneic

KINETICS OF TRIAZENE-INDUCED CX
AND IMMUNOGENICITY OF DRUGTREATED CELLS AT CLONAL LEVEL
In most of published studies, fully immunogenic
xenogenized cell lines were generated following 5-7
transplant generations of treatment with high daily doses
of triazenes (see Figure 1A). The magnitude of graft
response of histocompatible mice against triazene-treated
cells was found to be comparable to that detectable in
mice challenged with major histocompatibility complex
(MHC)-incompatible malignant cells [12]. Actually,
the status of “fully immunogenic” xenogenized cells is
revealed by the rejection of at least 105 (and sometimes
41642

Oncotarget

up to 107) triazene-treated cells by intact, wholly
histocompatible recipients. It is noteworthy that in the
same host/tumor systems, even 1 murine leukemia cell
(e.g. L1210 leukemia in DBA/2 or CD2F1 mice) is often
able to kill the untreated host with generalized leukemia
within 15-17 days (see Figure 1B).
A typical kinetics of the xenogenization process
occurring in CD2F1 mice challenged with L5178Y
leukemia (105 cells ip) and treated with DTIC [13] is
illustrated in Figure 1A. At transplant generation “0”
(i.e. at the beginning of the process), DTIC-treated mice
showed a median survival time (MST) longer compared
to controls, although no animal survived beyond the 60day observation period. At transplant generation 1 and 2
no significant difference in MSTs was noticed between
control and DTIC-treated mice, probably indicating
the onset of drug resistance in leukemic cells exposed
in vivo to the alkylating agent. Progressively, from
transplant generation 3 onward, control mice survived
significantly longer than DTIC-treated recipients, and
at transplant generation 5 all controls were long-term
survivors, whereas all DTIC treated mice died, with an
MST of 10 days. This phenomenon was interpreted as a

result of host’s graft response against highly immunogenic
DTIC-treated cells. Indeed, intact mice rejected the
tumor, whereas DTIC-treated hosts, which were severely
immunodepressed by the compound [7, 14], or mice
pretreated with cyclophosphamide succumbed with
generalized leukemia. This finding ruled out the possibility
that DTIC-treated L5178Y was a leukemia subline
dependent on DTIC for growth.
Similar results were obtained with a number of
mouse leukemias and the degree of immunogenicity of
drug-treated cells for the histocompatible host was often
similar to that detectable in target cells incompatible for
the entire H-2 haplotype. In fact, the results illustrated
in Figure 1B show that all intact CD2F1 mice that were
able to reject 107 cells of the H-2-incompatible L5MF22 leukemia, were also able to reject 107 cells of the
histocompatible L1210 cells subjected to 5 transplant
generations of DTIC treatment. On the other hand, all
mice immunodepressed by total-body irradiation, or by
pretreatment with DTIC or cyclophosphamide succumbed
with generalized leukemia following challenge with the
“xenogenized” L1210 leukemia cells.
Of particular interest are the findings that CX

leukemia cell immunogenicity in CD2F1 mice exposed to DTIC (50 mg/Kg/day ip, from day 1 through day 10) after ip challenge with
105 L5178Y leukemia cells of DBA/2 origin. At transplant generation 4, 2 out of 6 control mice not subjected to DTIC treatment, survived
longer than the 60 days of observation period. At transplant generation 5, all untreated mice survived beyond the 60 day-observation period.
On the other hand, all CD2F1 recipients treated with DTIC or immunodepressed by pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cy, 180 mg/
Kg, 6 h before tumor challenge) died with evidence of generalized leukemia at the autopsy. Figure 1B. Extent of immunogenicity levels
of xenogenized leukemia cells (L1210/DTIC x 5, i.e. L1210 leukemia of DBA/2 origin, treated with DTIC 100 mg/Kg/day for 10 days, for
5 transplant generations). The number of dead mice over the total injected are indicated on the top of each column. Two types of recipient
mice were used, i.e. the H-2b homozygous C57BL/10.129(5M) mice syngeneic with L5MF-22 leukemia, and the CD2F1 hosts (H-2d/H-2d),
fully histocompatible with L1210 leukemia. The degree of full compatibility between host and tumor is indicated by the observation that
almost all CD2F1 mice died for leukemia even after challenge with as low as 1 L1210 cell ip. In addition all C57BL/10.129(5M) mice died
with generalized leukemia after injection of 107 cells of the syngeneic L5MF-22 leukemia. The degree of immunogenicity of L1210/DTIC
x 5 cells for the H-2-compatible CD2F1 hosts appears to be comparable to that of the H-2-incompatible L5MF-22 for the same CD2F1
recipients. In fact, up to 107 cells of both leukemias were completely rejected by CD2F1 mice that survived beyond the 60 day observation
period. On the other hand, all immunodepressed recipients, either irradiated (Irr, 4 Gy delivered on day -1 before challenge), pretreated
with cyclophosphamide (Cy, 180 mg/Kg administered 6 h before tumor transplantation) or treated with DTIC (DTIC 100 mg/Kg/day for
10 days) died after challenge with the same number of xenogenized L1210 leukemia cells.

is also inducible in vitro [15] and that the highly
immunogenic triazene-treated cells obtained either in vivo
or in vitro, retain their immunogenic properties after up
to 90 passages in immunodepressed mice not exposed to
triazenes [13]. It is obvious that these tumor neoantigens
are heritable after a number of malignant cell divisions
and can thus be considered immunological targets even
after triazene withdrawal. Therefore the presence of druginduced neoantigens in tumor cell population could be of
therapeutic advantage for different immunotherapeutic
strategies in cancer treatment.
Further experiments were conducted in order to
explore whether a limited degree of immunogenicity could
be revealed during the initial 1-3 transplant generations
of triazene treatment using a protocol based on immunochemotherapy synergism [16]. Figures 2A and 2B
show the survival times of mice challenged with L1210
leukemia of DBA/2 origin. No difference in survival
times was detected between fully histocompatible CD2F1
mice and H-2d-compatible BALB/c mice incompatible for
minor histocompatibility loci. However, while treatment
with a low dose of bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea (BCNU)
was minimally active in CD2F1 hosts, in the majority of
experiments, it was able to “cure”, all allogeneic BALB/c
mice [17] that are thought to be able to mount a weak
allograft response. In this model, therefore, synergism
between weak graft response and chemotherapy reveals
antitumor immune reactions not easily detectable without
drug treatment.
As illustrated in Figure 2C, CD2F1 mice were
inoculated with leukemic cells obtained from DTICtreated donors during initial transplant generations
of DTIC treatment, before the appearance of strong
immunogenicity in L5178Y/DTIC leukemia. Animals
were then treated with low-dose BCNU and survival
time analysis showed longer overall survival than those
subjected to the same treatment, but immunodepressed
with total-body irradiation delivered one day before tumor
challenge. This observation suggests a stepwise increase
in immunogenicity of leukemic blasts exposed in vivo to
daily pulses of DTIC, possibly as a result of a progressive
rise of mutation load, in line with the hypothesis illustrated
in Figure 3 (see below).
The appearance of relatively weak immunogenicity
after a single exposure to DTIC was confirmed in CD2F1
mice inoculated ip with 108 L1210 cells and injected 1
h later with a single high-dose of DTIC (300 mg/Kg,
[18]). Again, almost all intact CD2F1 mice challenged
with 106 leukemic cells collected from the DTIC-treated
donors were “cured” by a single dose of BCNU (10 mg/
Kg), whereas most recipient mice exposed to the same
treatment, but immunodepressed with cyclophosphamide,
died with generalized leukemia.
After the discovery of CX [1], in view of its possible
biological and clinical relevance, some fundamental
cellular and molecular aspects of the xenogenization
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

process were investigated by different groups. Great
priority was given to studies aimed at establishing whether
different xenogenized neoplastic cells present crossreacting neoantigens, or if each triazene-treated tumor is
composed of a homogeneous cell population containing
a single set of neoantigens, or of a number of clones
showing different non-cross-reacting neoantigens. In 1986
the group of Angelo Nicolin [19] cloned a xenogenized
L1210 leukemia cell line and analyzed the single clones
for immunogenicity and cross-reactivity in terms of CTL
generation and susceptibility to lysis. They concluded that
the xenogenized leukemia contained a heterogeneous but
limited number of different antigenically cross-reacting
and non-cross reacting cell clones. Later, Marelli et
al.[20] xenogenized a homogeneous mouse leukemia cell
population starting from a single L1210 clone, cloned the
DTIC-treated cell line and evaluated the immunogenic
properties and cross-reactivity of the clones. The authors
concluded that at least one common specific neoantigen
is reproducibly elicited by DTIC treatment within an
identical malignant cell population. In the light of the
mutational mechanism underlying CX (see below), it is
reasonable to hypothesize that multiple point mutational
events generated by a triazene-targeted hot spot could
result in the appearance of common non-self peptide(s)
in leukemic cell population. Notably, no CX affecting
normal bone marrow cells was detected in DTIC-treated
mice (Bonmassar E et al., unpublished data).

CX IS THE RESULT OF DRUG-INDUCED
MUTATIONAL MECHANISMS LEADING
TO THE APPEARANCE OF NON-SELF
IMMUNOGENIC PEPTIDES
The first report describing CX [1] already contained
the hypothesis that this phenomenon could have been
generated by somatic mutations, since DTIC was classified
as a carcinogenic compound able to alkylate DNA [21, 22].
Further studies established that Quinacrine, an antimalarial
drug with anti-mutagenic activity [23], suppresses
entirely CX without impairing the antitumor and the
immunosuppressant activity of DTIC [24]. However,
direct evidence that a mutational mechanism was involved
in triazene-induced appearance of neoantigens was not
obtained until the molecular investigations performed by
Grohmann et al. in the 1990s [10, 25, 26]. As previously
mentioned, the authors found that CX was the result of
point mutations provoked mainly by triazene-induced
methyl adducts to the oxygen 6 of DNA guanine, affecting
retroviral sequences normally present in mouse genome
[27], followed by the appearance of MHC-restricted
highly immunogenic non-self peptides.
Seven years after the discovery of DTIC-induced
CX, the group of Thierry Boon found that selected
clones obtained from a mouse teratocarcinoma cell line

generations of DTIC treatment, revealed by immuno-chemotherapy synergism. When not specified in terms of number of

dead mice over the total tested indicated on the top of the columns, all mice (6-8 animals for group) died with generalized leukemia. Figure
2A. Graded numbers of L1210 leukemia cells were inoculated into fully histocompatible CD2F1 mice, or into H-2d-compatible BALB/c
mice, incompatible for multiple minor histocompatibility antigens (see Ref 17). The marginal allograft response of BALB/c hosts was not
adequate to restrain the growth of leukemic cells, as evidenced by the finding that no substantial difference in median survival time was
detected between CD2F1 and BALB/c mice inoculated with as low as 102 L1210 cells ip. Figure 2B. CD2F1 and BALB/c mice were
inoculated with 105 L1210 cells ip. In this case, CD2F1 mice treated with a low dose of BCNU, (3.9 mg/Kg ip, administered on day 3
after tumor transplantation) showed a limited increase in MST with respect to that of untreated controls (C). In contrast, all BCNU-treated
allogeneic BALB/c mice, survived beyond the 60 day-observation period, thus confirming the possibility of revealing a marginal antitumor
graft response of the host through an immune-chemotherapy synergistic effect. Figure 2C. (data from Ref 13). The strategy of immunechemotherapy synergism indicates that murine leukemia cells exposed in vivo to DTIC acquire appreciable levels of immunogenicity
already at transplant generation “1”. Malignant cell immunogenicity progressively increases at the successive generations of treatment
with the triazene compound. This figure illustrates the results of a typical experiment performed to evaluate the immunogenic properties of
L5178Y leukemia cells in the course of the first 4 transplant generations of DTIC treatment (DTIC 100 mg/Kg/day ip for 10 days) in CD2F1
mice. Blasts (105 cells) obtained from non-treated leukemic donors (i.e. at transplant generation “0”) or from DTIC-treated leukemic donors
(at transplant generations 1 through 4) were inoculated into 4 groups of mice, i.e. non-treated (NT), immunodepressed through exposure to
total-body irradiation (Irr, 4 Gy X rays, on day -1), treated with BCNU (10 mg/Kg ip), immunodepressed (i.e. pre-irradiated) and treated
with BCNU (Irr/BCNU). An additional group of mice was treated with DTIC to obtain a further generation of treatment with the triazene
compound. At transplant generation “0” the intact L5178Y cells did not show appreciable immunogenicity, since all non-immunodepressed
or irradiated recipients treated with BCNU showed a similar modest increase of MST over that of non-treated controls. Remarkably,
at transplant generation “1” instead, L5178Y cells obtained from DTIC-treated donors showed immunogenicity strength similar to that
conferred by products of minor histocompatibility loci. This is evidenced by the consistent increase of survival times of BCNU-treated
animals respect to those of mice not subjected to chemotherapy, or treated with BCNU but immunodepressed by means of total-body
irradiation.

histocompatible recipients through an immunomediated

mechanism [28]. MNNG is a classical mutagen that
adds methyl groups to a number of nucleophilic sites

[29]. In particular, if not repaired (see below), the O6methylguanine (O6-MeG) is responsible of point mutations
leading to the appearance of specific Ags able to elicit cellmediated immune responses and graft rejection. Boon and
his group identified several MNNG-treated tumor cell
sublines that were termed tum- variants since they were
unable to grow into immunocompetent histocompatible
mice, but grew rapidly in immunodepressed recipients and
elicited cytotoxic T-cell responses [28, 30]. In addition,
the mutational mechanism underlying the biological
features of tum- variants was confirmed by molecular
investigations of the same group between 1988 and 1990
[31, 32]. In a mouse mastocytoma P815 model they
identified genome sequences targets of MNNG-induced
mutations, responsible for malignant cell immunogenicity.
In the meantime, Altevogt et al. [33] found that a similar
mechanism underlies the immunogenicity of the mouse
lymphoma cell line Eb (a subline of L5178YE) exposed
to MNNG. Also in MNNG-induced xenogenization,
tumor cell immunogenicity was based on the presence
of mutation-generated MHC-restricted non-self peptides
[34].
All these findings indicate that malignant cell
xenogenization can be obtained with two distinct classes
of compounds, i.e. triazenes of large clinical application
and MNNG, a mutagenic compound of no use in cancer
chemotherapy (see Figure 3). Therefore, in the present
review we have decided to maintain the term “CX” for
mutagen-induced xenogenization and to adopt the new
term “Drug-Induced Xenogenization” (DIX) to describe
the induction of novel antigenic specificities by exposure
to pharmacological agents.

to radioresistant natural immunity of “hybrid resistance
(Hh)” type [45, 46].

DIX/CX AND ROLE OF DNA REPAIR
ENZYMES
The antitumor activity and the DIX property
of triazenes are crucially dependent on the function
of different DNA repair enzymes (reviewed in [47]
and briefly summarized in Figure 4). In particular,
triazenes and MNNG are mutagenic since they both
induce methyl adducts to the oxygen-6 of DNA guanine
(reviewed in [48]), This type of biochemical lesion is
also responsible for the antitumor activity of triazenes
as evidenced by Catapano et al. [49]. The cytotoxic and
xenogenizing activity of these DNA mono-methylating
compounds is antagonized by the DNA repair enzyme O6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). If the
drug-treated cell does not eliminate the adducts through
adequate nuclear levels of MGMT, O6-MeG of DNA loses
pairing compatibility with C and triggers a Mismatch
Repair (MMR) response [47, 50]. Since the MMR system
is competent to replace an appropriate nucleotide in the
newly formed strand but not in the “old” strand during
DNA synthesis, no repair by this enzymatic system is
feasible. It follows that after several “futile” unsuccessful
repair attempts, apoptotic signal can be generated and,
if the apoptosis machinery is correctly working, the
damaged cell dies. In the absence of a functional MMR
system, proliferation is not impaired. Frequent G:C to
A:T transitions occur since during the DNA duplication
process O6-MeG preferably pairs with T rather than with
C, and at the second round of duplication, the new strand
will contain A instead of G (Figure 4). Therefore, the
molecular mainstay of DIX relies on MGMT and MMR
deficiency that assures the highest mutation load attainable
following triazene treatment. In contrast, the cytotoxic
activity of these agents requires low levels of MGMT but
a fully efficient MMR system [47]. This seems to be in
line with previous findings illustrated by Fioretti et al. [51]
that demonstrated a clear dissociation between the onset
of resistance to DTIC treatment and emergence of DIX,
although no data on MMR status of target leukemia cells
was mentioned in that report.

NEOANTIGENS

DIX ELICIT CELL-MEDIATED AND
HUMORAL IMMUNITY IN VIVO AND
IN VITRO
Immune responses against xenogenized leukemia
cells were found to be extremely complex, including T-cell
dependent graft responses (as detailed in the previous
sections), T-cell independent, radio-resistant graft response
[35], H-2-restricted T-cell mediated cytotoxicity [10, 19,
20, 25, 26, 36-38] and weak humoral responses [39-43].
The T-cell dependency of the classical graft rejection
found in histocompatible mice was confirmed by the
finding that BALB/c nu/nu mice were not competent for
rejecting xenogenized leukemia cells [8]. In addition,
the growth kinetics and rejection pattern of xenogenized
cells in the peritoneal cavity of mice were similar to
those of untreated leukemic cells transplanted into H-2incompatible recipients [44]. Significant impairment of
xenogenized blast growth limited to the splenic territory,
was found in lethally-irradiated histocompatible mice [35],
suggesting that triazene-treated cells could be susceptible

PRECLINICAL STUDIES ON DIXMEDIATED ANTITUMOR IMMUNOCHEMOTHERAPY
Since host’s antitumor responses appear to be
mandatory for a successful treatment of cancer, numerous
attempts have been made to exploit DIX for treatment
of primary recipient mice bearing a non-treated parental
leukemia. Therefore, histocompatible mice bearing L1210
were treated with a xenogenizing and immunosuppressive
41647

dose of DTIC (50 mg/Kg/day for 5 days) to induce a
limited but significant DIX. Thereafter, recipient mice
were infused with intact syngeneic splenocytes to restore
immune reactivity compromised by DTIC administration,
followed by treatment with BCNU in order to obtain
synergistic effects between host’s graft response against
xenogenized leukemia and chemotherapy. However, this
protocol did not work until it was modified by adding a
single limited dose of cyclophosphamide (100 mg/Kg)
administered before spleen cell injection [52]. In this
case a relatively high number of long-term survivors
was observed, demonstrating in a preclinical model
that DIX strategy can be a realistic approach for cancer
immuno-chemotherapy. The role of cyclophosphamide
in this study has not been definitely established
although it could be ascribed to regulatory T cell

(Treg) suppression and/or dendritic cell maturation [53,
54]. In any case, several antitumor agents, including
cyclophosphamide and irradiation have shown a number
of immunoenhancing effects (reviewed in [55]). In a
mouse model, cyclophosphamide produces an initial
lymphoid organ depletion which enhances the activity
of adoptively transferred antitumor immune cells. This
effect appears to be driven mainly by a cyclophosphamideinduced “cytokine storm” within 48 h from the injection
[56], consisting in the up-regulation of interleukin (IL)1, IL-2, IL-7 and IL-21, essential for T cell homeostatic
proliferation.
Consistent with these findings, a phase I/II
clinical trial, performed on 10 disease-free HLA-A2+
melanoma patients, has proven that vaccination with
Melan-A and gp100 peptides in combination with DTIC

express high levels of the DNA repair MGMT that acts as methyl acceptor molecule, all adducts are rapidly repaired and triazene treatment
is totally ineffective. On the other hand, if MGMT levels are low or are down-regulated by MGMT inhibitors (e.g. Lomeguatrib, [202]),
the adduct is stable and a mismatch signal is generated by C:O6-MeG, and after one duplication by frequent G:T mismatches. If the cells
express a fully active MMR system and the apoptotic function is not compromised, triazene treatment results in target cell apoptotic death.
Alternatively, if neoplastic cells are MMR deficient or their apoptotic pathways do not work properly, malignant growth normally goes on
and mutation of G:C -> A:T transition type frequently occurs, leading to DIX appearance.

with vaccination alone and prevents melanoma relapse
[57]. Global transcriptional analysis of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells revealed a DTIC-induced activation
of genes involved in the immune response and leukocyte
stimulation in patients treated with combined chemoimmunotherapy. In particular, it was found a progressive
widening of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity
[58], accompanied by high avidity and high anti-tumor
T-cell polyfunctionality [59]. This clinical finding does
not appear to be in contrast with the well documented
immunosuppressive activity of DTIC previously
described, since there is a difference in the dose mainly
used in the mouse model (i.e. 100 mg/Kg daily for 5 days)
and in the clinical investigation (one single administration
of 800 mg/sqm, toxicologically equivalent to 21 mg/Kg in
man and 260 mg/kg in mouse [60]).
Adoptive immunotherapy studies in mice showed
that transfer of T lymphocytes presensitized against
xenogenized leukemia cells can prolong significantly the

ICPI AND CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY
In the last 5 years we assisted to the steep increase
of clinical investigations on cancer immunotherapy [63]
- especially with the adoption of ICpI [64] - starting
with supposedly immunogenic malignant diseases, such
as melanoma and kidney carcinoma. Actually, the first
clinical report on the therapeutic and toxic effects of the
earliest ICpI utilized in cancer patients, i.e. Ipilimumab,
can be traced back in 2003 when Hodi et al. [65] published
their studies on this anti-CTLA-4 mAb in a clinical
setting. A relatively long period of time was taken in the
attempts to establish the best effective dose and schedule,
and the safety of ICpI in a limited number of patients,
mainly affected by metastatic melanoma. Thereafter,
clinical studies involving ICpI-based immunotherapy
were extended to a large variety of neoplastic diseases, as

by inducing cytokine production and promoting T-cell
proliferation [68] and are essential for lowering the
threshold of TCR activation, supporting the responses
against low-affinity Ags [69]. Poorly functional,
differentiated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are characterized by
the loss of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD27 and
CD28, which have been described also as useful markers
for defining T-cell subpopulations at various stages of
differentiation [70-73]. However a substantial redundancy
in co-stimulatory receptor usage has been demonstrated
and co-stimulation through inducible T-cell co-stimulator
(a ICOS CD28 family member), CD137 and CD134
(members of the tumor necrosis factor family) contributes
to enhance T-cell activation [73-77] in CD28- T cells [73].
Therefore, additional changes to the loss of co-stimulatory
receptors are involved in T-cell differentiation-related
dysfunction. One such change is a rise in the expression of
co-inhibitory receptors, commonly referred to as immune
checkpoints, which negatively modulate the response of T
cells to self proteins, chronic infection and tumor Ags and

WHY IMMUNE CHECKPOINTS AS TARGET
OF CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY?
A detailed comprehension of the mechanisms
involved in the antitumor immune response is essential
for explaining the development of innovative therapeutic
strategies based on ICpI. The generation of an effective
antitumor T-cell response involves the passage through
different steps including Ag-specific T-cell priming,
differentiation, trafficking and killing of tumor cells by
cytotoxic CD8+ T cells [66]. Furthermore, the amplitude
and the quality of Ag-specific T-cell activation is a finely
regulated process where the balance between TCR
engagement and co-stimulatory as well as inhibitory
signals is critical in order to maintain the self-tolerance
and prevent T-cell over-activation [67]. Co-stimulatory
molecules play a critical role during T-cell activation

tumor micro-environment (TME), once there, they are
negatively regulated by the cancer cells themselves and by
immunosuppressive factors and infiltrating cells. Among
these immunosuppressive elements are transforming
growth factor-β, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor,
Treg, [82] and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs,
[83-84]). In addition, potential antitumor T cells present
in TME are exposed to checkpoint pathways which play
a critical role in regulating T-cell phenotype and function
[85-89]. Then, the immunosuppressive nature of TME
drives the infiltrating tumor-specific T cells towards
terminal differentiation and exhaustion [90]. Exhausted
T cells lose their functional activity in terms of cytokine
production in a hierarchical way: IL-2 production is lost
first, tumor necrosis factor-α production at the intermediate
phase, while interferon (IFN)-γ and granzyme B are lost
at an advanced stage of exhaustion [91]. PD-1 is one of
the major regulator of T-cell exhaustion, however immune
checkpoint receptors operate by using rather distinctive
and non-redundant signaling pathways. Moreover,
co-inhibitory receptors have been shown to function
synergistically, mostly in concert with PD-1, suggesting
that distinct molecules provide individual functions able
to impair T-cell responses [92-95].

CTLA-4, the first immune checkpoint receptor to
be clinically targeted, primarily controls the amplitude
of T-cell activation, contributing to the preservation of
T-cell homeostasis [5, 67]. CTLA-4 knockout mice die
within three weeks from immune destruction of multiple
organs [96], which proves a critical role as regulator of
T-cell-dependent immune responses. CTLA-4 mainly
antagonizes the activity of CD28 by sharing its ligands,
CD80 and CD86 - expressed by Antigen Presenting Cells
(APCs) - with a much higher overall affinity for both
molecules compared to the contender co-stimulatory
receptor [97]. Thus CTLA-4 expression reduces T-cell
activity by competing with CD28 in the binding with
CD80 and CD86 and by delivering inhibitory signals to
the T cell [98-100]. Although CTLA-4 is also expressed
by activated CD8+ effector T cells, this molecule plays
its main physiologic role by down-regulating CD4+
helper T-cell activity. Importantly, CTLA-4 engagement
improves the suppressive activity of Tregs [101, 102]
which are typically concentrated in tumor tissues where
they contribute to the inhibition of anti-tumor effector
responses. It follows that CTLA-4 blockade results in a

wide enhancement of the immune responses dependent
on CD4+ helper T cells. The expression of CTLA-4 is
constitutive on Tregs, where it represents a target gene
of the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 [103, 104], a
major player in the development and function of Tregs.
The critical function played by CTLA-4 in regulating
Treg function is confirmed by the observation that mice
with CTLA-4-lacking Tregs show systemic lymphoproliferation, fatal T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases
and potent anti-tumor immunity.
The engagement of CTLA-4 has been shown to
inhibit CD3/CD28-mediated activation of the serine/
threonine kinase AKT in T cells mainly through the
recruitment and activation of the protein phosphatase 2A
[105, 106] and not through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) inactivation. However, CTLA-4 has been reported
to bind also the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. SHP-2
activation suppresses the CD3/CD28-induced T-cell
transcriptional profile and results in the inactivation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LCK and ZAP-70 kinases as well as the dephosphorylation
of the CD3-ζ chains of the TCR complex, thus reducing
activation of the TCR signaling [105, 106]. However, the
role of SHP-2 in the CTLA-4 negative regulation T-cell
function has not been fully elucidated yet.
The intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms mediated by
the intracellular domain of CTLA-4 are accompanied by
a cell-extrinsic mechanism which involves the capture
of CD80 and CD86 from APCs by trans-endocytosis,
the degradation of these molecules inside the T cell and
the inhibition of T-cell activation through the CD28
engagement [107].

THE PD-1 PROTEIN AND ITS LIGANDS
The inhibitory mechanisms triggered by PD-1 are
distinct from those described for CTLA-4. The relatively
milder and more chronic clinical pathological phenotypes
which result from PD-1 blockade are probably related to
41653

Oncotarget

the cell-intrinsic function and to the regulation of PD-1
expression.
PD-1 is a member of the CD28 superfamily, and
plays its physiologic inhibitory role by regulating the
induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance, thus
protecting tissues from autoimmunity, especially during
inflammatory and Ag-specific responses [108-111,
67]. In particular, PD-1 exerts its inhibitory functions
only after T-cell activation, following Ag recognition,
thus contributing to restrain the effector phase of T-cell
mediated tumor rejection [112]. The amount and source
of Ag determines the strength and the kinetics of T-cell
activation as well as the extent and regulation of PD-1
expression. Moreover, the ligands of PD-1, able to activate
the molecule on T cells, are expressed to a different extent
depending on the cell type [109].
PD-1 is expressed on activated T cells as well as
on B and natural killer (NK) cells, activated monocytes
and some subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) [109], implying
a broad contribution in the immune regulation. The two
ligands for PD-1 are PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) and PD-L2
(B7-DC, CD273) [109, 113-115]. Moreover, it has been
unexpectedly observed a molecular interaction between
PD-L1 and CD80, which indicates that CD80 expressed
on T cells and APCs can possibly work as a receptor rather
than a ligand, eliciting inhibitory signals when engaged by
PD-L1 [116].
PD-L1 is expressed on resting T cells, B cells,
DCs, macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, pancreatic
islet cells and in various types of cancers, including Non
Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal
cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma
as well as cutaneous lymphoma, multiple myeloma and
various leukemias [117-125]. Elevated expression of PDL1 has been found to represent an adverse prognostic
biomarker in NSCLC [126]. PD-L1 can be up-regulated
by IFN-γ produced by tumor-infiltrating T cells thus
promoting the progression of cancer [127]. Moreover,
in vitro exposure of human lymphoma cells to T cells or
monocytes has been shown to up-regulate blast-associated
PD-L1 expression [128]. Also radiation or chemotherapy
can up-regulate PD-L1 [129, 130]. In particular,
radiotherapy may induce direct killing of tumor cells and
multiple immune-modulatory changes that can potentially
influence the effectiveness of immunotherapy [129, 131].
On the other hand, NSCLC patients are significantly more
responsive to anti-PD-1 mAbs when malignant cells overexpress PD-L1 [132].
PD-L2, although less expressed by tumors than PDL1, also binds to PD-1 and regulates T-cell function [133].
PD-L2 is constitutively expressed at low levels but can be
induced on DCs, macrophages and mast cells in response
to IL-4 and type 1 IFNs [134]. These differences in the
pattern of expression suggest different functions played
by the engagement of PD-1 in the immune regulation
within distinct cell contexts. The limited expression of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PD-L2 primarily to APC reflects a function in the control
of the T-cell priming, while the wide occurrence of PDL1 speaks in favor of an overall protective function of
peripheral tissues from extreme inflammation.
Viruses and tumors exploit the negative regulatory
function of PD-1, causing the inhibition of effector T-cell
functionality, which translates into the onset of chronic
infections and represents a major mechanism of immune
resistance within the TME favoring the tumor progression.
Upon stimulation, PD-1, through its association
with the SHP2 phosphatase, inhibits the proximal
TCR signaling, leading to a strong reduction of T-cell
functionality. PD-1 also prevents AKT phosphorylation by
inhibiting CD28-mediated stimulation of PI3K [105, 106].
Therefore, CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibit AKT by distinctive
mechanisms.
Of remarkable importance is the finding that PD-1
blocks T-cell cycle progression through the G1 phase by
suppressing the transcription of SKP2, a factor encoding a
component of the ubiquitin ligase SCFSkp2 able to degrade
p27kip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases [135].
PD-1-mediated decrease of SKP2 transcription is achieved
through the inhibition of PI3K/AKT, Ras and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. IL-2 partially
restores SKP2 expression, probably through the activation
of ERK, but not the AKT signaling, demonstrating that
PD-1 is able to impair T-cell proliferative potential by
affecting multiple regulators of the cell cycle.
T-cell exhaustion is related to physical T-cell
depletion especially in cancer. Apoptosis is one of
the several potential mechanisms involved in PD-L1associated T-cell death, which is supported by the inverse
correlation existing between PD-L1 expression in tumor
tissues and the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) [136].
Foxp3+ Tregs express PD-1 and PD-L1 [137]
and a critical function for the PD-1 engagement in the
generation of Tregs has been clearly demonstrated [138].
In particular, the engagement of PD-1 on naive T cells
can lead to the development of induced Treg cells partly
through the inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling [139].
Being many tumors highly infiltrated with Tregs which
further suppress T-cell effector responses, PD-1 blockade
can potentially enhance the antitumor responses also by
decreasing the amount and the suppressive action of intratumoral Tregs.
The inhibitory function of the PD-1/PD-L1
engagement plays a critical role in reducing the immunesurveillance against tumors by inducing T-cell exhaustion.
Therefore, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has become an
attractive therapeutic target in the setting of cancer. PD-1
is highly expressed on exhausted T cells that develop in
the setting of chronic Ag stimulation such as cancer and
blockade of PD-L1 or PD-1 can reinvigorate the function
of exhausted T cells. Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 has been
extensively shown to enhance T-cell anti-tumor function

[140] including immune responses affecting malignant
cell growth in the brain [141]. Interestingly, while the PDL1/PD-1 signaling pathway is abundantly engaged in the
TME, expression of PD-1 on peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells has been shown to increase with tumor progression
[142].
Several clinical studies have shown that high
expression of PD-1 ligands on tumors correlates with
poor prognosis [126, 143], which strongly suggests that
the engagement of PD-L1/PD-1 pathway supports tumor
escape from antitumor T-cell control. However, although
co-inhibitory receptors have so far been considered to
mark terminally differentiated “exhausted” T cells, they
have recently been also associated with the activation
status and the differentiation profile of Ag-specific T cells
[59, 144] and must be considered instrumental for limiting
the self-tissue damage at the tumor site. As stated before,
the fate of T cells after the encounter with the specific
Ag is determined also by additional inputs through coreceptors which finely regulate strength, duration and
properties of the response upon interaction with their
ligands. Co-expression of PD-1 with other co-stimulatory
or co-inhibitory molecules in a particular Ag-context may
then represent a rheostat in the control of highly reactive
stimulated T cells [59, 145].

THE KILLER-CELL LECTIN
RECEPTOR G1 (KLRG1)

MHC class II molecules on APCs but with significantly
higher affinity as compared with the CD4 molecule
[157], thus decreasing the Ag-dependent stimulation of
CD4+ T cells. However, a double role in regulating T-cell
functionality has been suggested by the observation that
expression of LAG-3 on T cells is associated with either
the down-regulation of cytokine secretion [158, 159] or
the induction of Th1 cytokine production, including IL-2
[160]. LAG-3 plays also a critical role in the control
of the functional activity of both natural and induced
immunosuppressive Tregs. As described for CTLA-4 and
PD-1, LAG-3 is essential for the extrinsic regulation of
Treg homeostasis and development [161]. A population of
expanded CD4+CD25highFoxp3+ Tregs expressing LAG3 has been identified in the peripheral blood, in T cells
of tumor-invaded lymph nodes and in T cells infiltrating
the visceral metastasis of melanoma and sarcoma patients
[162]. Of particular interest is the observation that high
LAG-3-expression makes effector T cells more susceptible
to Treg-mediated suppression [154].
LAG-3 is highly co-expressed with other immune
inhibitory molecules, including TIM-3, PD-1, 2B4 and
T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), on
tumor-specific CD4+ effector T cells [163]. On Melan-A
specific CD8+ T cells isolated from melanoma patients,
LAG-3 is highly co-expressed with PD-1 and TIM-3 [59].
LAG-3 itself can directly modulate the activity of PD-1+ T
cells [163] and the synergy between LAG-3 and PD-1 can
potentiate the tumor-induced tolerance [164].

LIKE

The expression of KLRG1 on Ag-experienced T
cells and NK cells increases considerably with age and
differentiation [146-148], with the highest expression
observed in memory and in end-stage differentiated T
cells [149]. An inhibitory role for KLRG1 on the cytolytic
activity of polyclonal human NK cells has been suggested
[150]. Moreover a critical role has been demonstrated for
KLRG1 in the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation at the
ser473 site, which results in a compromised proliferation
of primary CD8+ T cells [148]. Actually, the loss of the
ability to phosphorylate AKT at ser473 is a functional
alteration that occurs throughout progressive T-cell
differentiation and ageing [73, 151].

TIM-3 PROTEIN
TIM-3 is a glycoprotein which possesses on its
extracellular portion both the immunoglobulin and the
mucin domain. TIM-3 has been initially observed on
terminally differentiated IFNγ-producing CD4+ Th1
cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [165, 166], as well as
on Th17, DCs, monocytes, Tregs, mast cells, NK cells,
TILs and tumor cells, including melanoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, gastric cancer and NSCLC cells, but not on
CD4+ Th2 cells [154].
The most important role of TIM-3 is the negative
control of Th1 immunity and the induction of peripheral
tolerance [167]. The TIM-3/galectin-9 pathway
engagement reduces the proliferative potential and
functionality of Th1 and Th17 cells [168] and contributes
to the immune-suppressive environment of TME through
the promotion of Treg development [169]. TIM-3 also
provides a new surface marker able to describe activated
tumor infiltrating Tregs, which have been found to
co-express higher levels of PD-1, CTLA-4 and the
glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptorrelated protein [170].
Consistent with the observation that the TIM3 and PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells represent the most
exhausted TIL population, co-blockade of the TIM-3 and

THE LAG-3 PROTEIN
LAG-3 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily
and is a crucial regulator of T-cell function [92, 152]. It is
expressed on activated T cells, B cells, NK cells, DCs and
TILs, but not on resting T cells [153, 154].
LAG-3 associates with the CD3-TCR complex after
the TCR engagement and negatively regulates the TCR
signaling in effector T cells in a pattern similar to that
observed for CTLA-4 [155], impairing T-cell proliferation,
homeostasis and functionality through the inhibition of
calcium fluxes (156]. Similar to CD4 molecule, LAG3 oligomerizes at the surface of T cells and binds to

relative abundance of selected adaptor molecules [176].

THE B AND T LYMPHOCYTE
ATTENUATOR (BTLA)

THE TIGIT RECEPTOR

This molecule has been identified as another
co-inhibitory receptor with structural and functional
similarities to CTLA-4 and PD-1 [178]. BTLA is induced
during T-cell activation and remains expressed on Th1
but not on Th2 CD4+ T cells. The engagement of BTLA
induces its tyrosine phosphorylation and association
with the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, thus
attenuating, through the subsequent inhibition of TCR
activation, the production of IL-2. BTLA is also expressed
on activated CD8+ T cells where it induces functional
inhibition through its ligand herpes virus entry mediator
(HVEM). In human virus Ag-specific CD8+ T cells the
expression of BTLA is gradually down-regulated as they
differentiate into effector cells [179]. In contrast, human
melanoma Ag-specific effector CD8+ T cells persistently
express high levels of BTLA and remain susceptible to
the functional inhibition mediated by its ligand HVEM.
Such persistence of BTLA expression has also been
found in tumor Ag-specific CD8+ T cells isolated from
melanoma patients with spontaneous anti-tumor immune
responses and after peptide vaccination. Interestingly, the
co-expression of BTLA with PD-1 and TIM-3 has been
shown to identify the most dysfunctional NY-ESO-1specific CD8+ T cell population in melanoma patients [80].

The co-inhibitory receptor TIGIT, that contains the
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM),
has been initially described as a modest inhibitor of
CD4+ T cell priming and NK cell killing activity. More
recently, it has been shown to be highly expressed by
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in parallel with PD-1
[172], as well as in models of chronic viral infection.
In particular, TIGIT has been proven to be a critical
and specific regulator of CD8+ T cell-dependent chronic
immune responses. Co-blockade of TIGIT and PDL1 improves synergistically the CD8+ T-cell effector
functional activity [173], an effect abolished by blockade
of the TIGIT’s corresponding co-stimulatory receptor,
CD226. The hypothesis that TIGIT may represent a
critical collaborator of the PD-1/PD-L1 engagement in
order to limit the activity of chronically stimulated CD8+
T cells is supported by the observation that co-blockade
of TIGIT and PD-1 is essential to restore the anti-tumor
functional activity of effector CD8+ T cells within the
highly immunosuppressive TME.
TIGIT has been shown to identify the most
dysfunctional subset of effector CD8+ T cells in tumors,
and the tumor-infiltrating Tregs characterized by a highly
suppressive phenotype. TIGIT signaling controls Treg
phenotype, and Tregs show an increased expression
of TIM-3 in the tumor tissue, where TIM-3 and TIGIT
synergize in the suppression of the immune responses
[174]. TIGIT expressing Foxp3+ Tregs have been recently
identified as a subset able to specifically suppress proinflammatory Th1 and Th17, but not Th2 cell responses
[175].

THE INDOLEAMINE 2,3 DIOXYGENASE
(IDO)
The control of the access to nutrients is an important
strategy able to regulate cellular responses to proliferative
stimuli. The IDO enzyme is responsible for a critical
step in the metabolic pathway that converts the essential
amino acid L-tryptophan into L-kynurenine, and has been
shown to exert a highly suppressive activity on T cells
[180]. Both L-tryptophan depletion and L-kynurenine
accumulation appear implicated in the immunosuppressive
activity of IDO [180].
IDO is expressed in different cell types, including
DCs and macrophages and plays a critical role in
immunological tolerance. Several cancer types can
express themselves IDO or induce its expression in host
APCs, either directly or indirectly, thus leading to the
impairment of T-cell functionality [181]. Tumors are then
able to create an immunosuppressive microenvironment
able to impair T-cell mediated antitumor immune response
by inducing IDO over-expression [182]. Interestingly, a
tumor-mediated IDO-dependent activation of suppressive
Tregs has also been documented [183].
In a mouse model, IDO expressed by the host
immune cells has been shown to reduce the infiltration of

THE NK CELL RECEPTOR 2B4
2B4 belongs to the CD2 family and is expressed
on NK, γ/δ and memory CD8+ T cells [176]. The murine
NK receptor 2B4 displays both inhibitory and activating
functions, whereas human 2B4 has been reported to be
mainly an activating molecule. In what way murine 2B4
can act both as an activating and inhibitory molecule
and what distinguishes its function from human 2B4
receptor is still under investigation [177]. The amount
of 2B4 expression and the level of 2B4 cross-linking
play a significant role in the regulation of 2B4-mediated
T-cell signaling pathway. A substantial reduction of T-cell
activation has been observed with high levels and a strong
engagement of 2B4, in the presence of a weak activation
of T-cell signaling-associated molecules. Therefore
2B4 can have opposite effects depending on the degree
of receptor expression, the level of its ligation, and the

tumor-reactive T cells in B16 tumors, inducing resistance
to immunotherapy with mAbs targeting CTLA-4 and
PD-1 [184]. Differently, IDO-KO mice have been shown
to mount a good anti-tumor response following treatment
with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs. This IDO-induced resistance
to T-cell-targeting immunotherapies has been associated
with a general increase in the recruitment of MDSCs
into the TME. A comparable association between IDO
expression and MDSC infiltration into the TME has been
observed in human melanoma samples and animal tumor
models naturally expressing high levels of IDO. These
observations prove that IDO represents a key regulator of
immunosuppression both at the systemic and TME level,
and provide a strong rationale for therapeutic targeting of
this pathway.

developing tumors before they become clinically apparent.
Cancer immunoediting enters the equilibrium phase when
cancer cells are not totally eliminated but cancer growth is
prevented by immune-mediated mechanisms. In particular,
the editing of tumor immunogenicity takes place during
the equilibrium phase, when some tumor cells become
not recognizable by the immune system (due to Ag loss
or defects in Ag processing or presentation), or resistant
to effector T-cells, or induce an immunosuppressive
environment within the TME. These tumor cells may then
enter the escape phase, where cancer growth is no longer
inhibited by the immune system and the tumor becomes
clinically apparent. However, external factors including
the immune senescence associated with ageing may
influence this directionality, and cancer cells may directly
progress toward the escape phase (186].

CANCER IMMUNOEDITING

THE ROLE OF MUTATION-INDUCED
TUMOR
NEOANTIGENS
AND
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ICPI.

The paradigm of cancer immunoediting shows that,
during the different phases of cancerogenesis and tumor
progression, the immune response shapes the tumor
with the selection of tumor variants that escape immune
recognition [81, 185, 186].
One of the crucial challenges in immunology is
the comprehension of the control of the immune system
on cancer development and progression. The immune
system plays a dual role in cancer development, being
able to contrast tumor growth but also to promote
progression either by selecting tumor cells resistant to
the immunological control or by modeling conditions
within the TME. An essential principle of cancer
immunosurveillance is that cancer cells express a number
of Ags different from their non-transformed counterparts.
These Ags include differentiation, mutated, overexpressed,
viral and cancer/testis molecules [186]. Changes capable
of conferring resistance to the attack by the immune
system include the loss of expression of tumor Ags and
an altered expression pattern of class I molecules, as a
consequence of critical deficiencies in the Ag processing
pathway. This promotes a reduced expression or a total
loss of class I peptide presentation, which in turn allows
tumor cell escape from Ag-specific effector CD8+ T-cell
killing.
In 2002 Dunn et al. [185] showed that tumors
developed in the absence of an intact immune system
(classified as “unedited” tumors) were more immunogenic
than similar tumors derived from immunocompetent
mice (classified as “edited” tumors). This observation
demonstrated that the immune system controls tumors
also in terms of quality and immunogenicity. The concept
that the immune system, besides its protective role, also
shapes tumor immunogenicity constitutes the starting
point of the “cancer immunoediting hypothesis”. Cancer
immunoediting consists of three sequential phases:
elimination, equilibrium, and escape [186]. In the
elimination phase, the immune system works at eliminating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

As tumors grow, they acquire mutations, some of
which generate neoantigens potentially able to elicit
host’s immune responses [187]. In relatively recent years,
a growing number of clinical studies has revealed a direct
correlation between mutation load detectable in malignant
cells and susceptibility to the therapeutic effectiveness of
ICpI. In particular, a direct relationship between the extent
of non-synonymous mutation burden and durable clinical
benefit was found in NSCLC [188] and in ovarian cancer
harboring mutated BRCA1/2 gene [189]. Moreover, Le et
al. [190] demonstrated that pembrolizumab, a mAb able
to suppress PD-1 function, was significantly more active
against metastatic colorectal cancer when malignant cells
were deficient for the MMR system. In this case, wholeexome sequencing showed that MMR-deficient tumor
cells had a number of somatic mutations approximately
25 times higher than that detectable in MMR-proficient
tumors.
Pharmacologically-driven non-synonymous somatic
mutations leading to increased immunogenicity of tumors
could be induced not only by triazenes but potentially also
by other antitumor agents. Actually, cisplatin that was
found to be highly mutagenic in a lymphoblastic cell line
model [191] merits further investigation for possible DIX
effects. In addition, drugs able to influence the epigenome
profile of malignant cells can provide novel immunogenic
targets through up-regulation of the expression of nonpathogenic retroviruses inserted in human cell genome
(“viral mimicry”) as found for colorectal cancer [192] and
supposedly applicable to neuroendocrine tumors [193].
The role of somatic mutations in the
immunogenicity of neoplastic cells and its relevance
not only in the therapeutic response to ICpI but also in
vaccine development has been widely confirmed by
several authors [194-198]. However, a note of caution

stems from a clinical investigation on NSCLC reported
by McGranahan [198] who stressed that, in spite of large
neoepitope burden, an excess of neoantigen intratumor
heterogeneity accompanied by the absence of common
antigenic determinants in all malignant cells does not
provide therapeutic advantage upon ICpI administration.
The authors termed “clonal neoantigens” tumor-specific
Ags - generally originated by mutational mechanisms that are present in the whole tumor cell population. On the
contrary, a number of different non cross-reacting tumorassociated neoantigens present in the bulk malignant cells
were designated as “subclonal neoantigens”. Therefore, it
is reasonable to predict that in case of clonal neoantigens,
host’s immune response can be efficiently directed against
a common epitope present in all tumor cells. Conversely,
in case of subclonal neoantigens, each of the great number
of malignant cell-associated neoantigens does not reach
the threshold required to elicit an effective cell-mediated
response even if assisted by ICpI-based therapy.

immunotherapy centered on ICpI administration
to amplify host’s cell-mediated responses targeting
pharmacologically-induced tumor neoantigens. Firstly,
somatic mutations affecting steps of the complex
apparatus involved in Ag presentation by malignant cells
could compromise its function [203, 204] thus subtracting
target cells from lethal attack by effectors of host’s
immunity. One of the most utilized devices adopted by
tumors to evade T-cell mediated immunity consists in
down-regulation of MHC class I molecule expression
thereby precluding non-self peptide presentation that
can be recognized by cytotoxic T cells [203, 205].
Several approaches have been described to be able to
increase MHC expression and to overcome defects in
Ag presentation pathways. In particular, upregulation
of HLA class I expression in malignant cells has been
obtained using pharmacological agents such as DNA
hypomethylating compounds (e.g. azacytidyne, [205, 206]
or, more recently, SGI-110 [207]) and histone deacetylase
inhibitors. Likewise, several studies indicated that histone
deacetylase inhibition is able to increase consistently
various mechanisms involved in Ag presentation,
including, for example, DC function [208].
Unexpectedly, neoantigen pattern of each single
patient could also provide additional problems concerning
the efficiency of ICpI treatment. Several data from the
literature point out that patients with tumors endowed
with mutations that are predicted to be immunogenic,
show survival benefit from ICpI administration [209].
However, as previously mentioned in this review, druginduced generation of extremely high numbers of
different neoantigens within the tumor cell population
(i.e. “subclonal neoantigens” [198]) could be unable
to elicit an adequate host’s response. It is reasonable to
predict that treatment with high-dose classical cytotoxic
or targeted chemotherapy could reduce substantially the
polyclonality of malignant cells pre-exposed to druginduced mutagenization. It follows that a relatively low
number of drug-resistant clones could provide an adequate
antigenic stimulus to the host’s immune apparatus. The
findings described by Nicolin et al. [210], who found
that several different L1210 cell lines resistant to a
number of antitumor agents are limitedly but significantly
immunogenic for the histocompatible host, could be
interpreted on this basis.
As an example, a purely speculative therapeutic
design stemming from a rational application of triazenerelated DIX followed by ICpI should contain at least
3 sequential phases. The first step (i.e. DIX phase)
includes temozolomide treatment in two types of
patients, i.e. those bearing MGMT-deficient neoplasia,
or those affected by MGMT-proficient malignancy. In
the latter case, temozolomide-induced xenogenization is
prevented by the efficient removal of methyl adducts at
O6-guanine [211, 212] and the triazene compound must
be associated with an MGMT inhibiting agent [213],

THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF DIX IN
APPROPRIATE COMBINATION WITH
ICPI
In the last few years we assisted to the enormous
expansion of preclinical and clinical studies on cancer
immunotherapy based on tumor-associated neoantigens
targeted by cytotoxic effector cells generated by immune
mechanisms amplified by ICpI. Since, as previously
stated, a large number of investigations found that tumor
neoantigens are generally the result of somatic mutations,
DIX appears to open new and exciting perspectives
in the future development of ICpI-dependent cancer
immunotherapy. In animal models, DIX was found to
be inducible in vivo or in vitro in a number of mouse
leukemia syngeneic with strains homozygous for different
types of MHC, such as H-2d (e.g. L1210 [1, 12, 15, 18,
19, 36, 199], LSTRA [9], L5178Y [13], P815 [200, 201])
H-2b (RBL-5 [9]) and H-2k (K36 [202]) although in this
case the immunogenicity of DTIC-treated cells was found
to be modest. This observation implies that DIX is not
limited to a specific genetic pattern in mouse models.
However, it must be stressed that all these malignant cell
types are characterized by complete homozygosity of the
entire genome and we do not know the influence that this
particular biological situation could have on the mutational
profile induced by triazenes.
As previously mentioned in this report, the earliest
hint of triazene-induced DIX in human neoplasias was
obtained by D’Atri et al. in 1994 [11] who found that
selected CD8+ CTL clones directed against in vitro
triazene-treated H-125 human lung adenocarcinoma cell
line were able to lyse the drug-treated cells but not the
untreated parental cells.
Several difficulties must be overcome before
formulating an adequate DIX-based design of cancer

including O6-benzylguanine [214, 215], cisplatin [216218] or Lomeguatrib, that is the best drug available
today [3, 47, 214, 219-221]. However, Lomeguatrib
downregulates profoundly MGMT expression in both
neoplastic and normal cells. Therefore, the dosage of
temozolomide must be carefully controlled since this
association is characterized by elevated myelotoxicity
[221]. Alternatively, if MGMT inhibitors are not available,
a sequential administration of high-dose triazenes
that deplete target cells of MGMT followed by a DIX
generating treatment with the same triazene could be
taken into consideration [ 222]. During the DIX phase,
it is possible that normal hematopoietic cells undergo
malignant transformation. Actually, treatment with
temozolomide, especially in brain tumor cases, has been
found to be followed by the appearance of leukemia or
myelodysplastic syndrome (reviewed in [223]). It can
be suggested that rare clones of target hematopoietic
cells survive temozolomide-induced apoptosis thank
to MMR deficiency [47] or inadequacy of the apoptotic
function. On the other hand, it is reasonable to hypothesize
that these clones could be also endowed with at least a
limited degree of immunogenicity that renders the cells
susceptible to host’s immune attack, especially after
extreme amplification by ICpI treatment.
The second phase (“clonal simplification”) comes
after the completion of DIX, and is directed to reduce
the number of xenogenized tumor cell clones through
treatment with a standard chemotherapy approach.
During this phase it is quite possible that the number of
immunogenic xenogenized subclones will be sensibly
reduced, since a limited number of drug-resistant clones
are selected. Therefore, at the end of phase 2 the host
should be able to mount an even minimal immune
response, although largely inefficient to control tumor
growth.
The third phase (ICpI-immune amplification) should
complete the work through treatment with ICpI, leading
to immune-mediated suppression of target xenogenized
malignant cells and bone-marrow-derived pre-malignant
cells.
In conclusion, triazene-induced DIX could open
up a new avenue in the area of tumor immunotherapy.
Indeed, this treatment modality discloses the invaluable
opportunity to design a pharmacological control of
neoantigen generation that provides the molecular bases
of efficient ICpI-dependent suppression of malignant cell
growth.
