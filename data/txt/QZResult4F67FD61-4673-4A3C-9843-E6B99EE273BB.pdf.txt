ABSTRACT
Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) are characterised by an indolent behaviour
in terms of tumor growth. However, most patients display metastasis at diagnosis
and no cure is currently available. Since the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis is deregulated in
PETs, the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 represents the first line treatment. Nevertheless,
some patients do not respond to treatments and most acquire resistance. Inhibition of
mTOR leads to feedback re-activation of PI3K activity, which may promote resistance
to RAD001. Thus, PI3K represents a novel potential target for PETs. We tested the
impact of three novel PI3K inhibitors (BEZ235, BKM120 and BYL719) on proliferation
of PET cells that are responsive (BON-1) or unresponsive (QGP-1) to RAD001. BEZ235
was the most efficient in inhibiting proliferation in PET cells. Furthermore, combined
treatment with BEZ235 and RAD001 exhibited synergic effects and was also effective
in BON-1 that acquired resistance to RAD001 (BON-1 RR). Analysis of PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway showed that RAD001 and BEZ235 only partially inhibited mTORdependent phosphorylation of 4EBP1. By contrast, combined therapy with the two
inhibitors strongly inhibited phosphorylation of 4EBP1, assembly of the translational
initiation complex and protein synthesis. Thus, combined treatment with BEZ235 may
represent suitable therapy to counteract primary and acquired resistance to RAD001
in PETs.

INTRODUCTION

somatostatin analogues [4]. Nevertheless, these therapeutic
approaches offer limited clinical benefits for patients.
In the past few years, this therapeutic scenario has
dramatically changed. Two novel targeted therapies, with
the selective inhibitor for the serine-threonine kinase
mTOR (Everolimus or RAD001) and the multi-target
tyrosine-kinase inhibitor sunitinib, have been approved for
advanced progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(pNETs) [5,6]. In particular, the rationale for the use of
RAD001 in PETs is sustained by solid preclinical data
with human samples and in vitro models that highlighted
the relevance of the PI3K-mTOR pathway in PETs [7-10].
For instance, low expression levels of negative regulators
of mTOR, such as PTEN and the TSC1/2 complex, are

Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) are rare
neoplasms that represent 1-2% of all pancreatic cancers
[1,2]. They are heterogeneous in terms of clinical
presentation, histological features, tumor grading and
staging at time of diagnosis [3,4]. Despite PETs are
considered to have an “indolent” behaviour, most
patients display metastases at the time of diagnosis, being
not eligible for surgery [3]. Furthermore, as PETs are
characterised by a low proliferation rate, chemotherapy
is chosen as first line treatment only for a subgroup
of patients with more aggressive features, whereas
treatment of the majority of PETs has generally employed

associated with worse prognosis in PET patients [7].
Moreover, a number of studies have confirmed the efficacy
of RAD001 in models of neuroendocrine tumours in vitro
[11,12]. However, despite the strong rationale and the
specific mechanism of action of RAD001, not all patients
respond to the treatment. Indeed, one third of patients
display primary insensitivity [13], whereas others initially
experience disease stabilization but they eventually
develop resistance to the drug and undergo disease
progression [5].
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis is involved in the
regulation of cell survival, proliferation and motility
[14]. mTOR is assembled in two main complexes named
mTORC1, which regulates mRNA translation and protein
synthesis in response to nutrients [15], and mTORC2,
which is mainly involved in cytoskeleton remodelling and
cell survival [16]. Notably, RAD001 specifically targets
the mTORC1 complex whereas mTORC2 is insensitive
to it, thus leaving some mTOR functions unaltered upon
treatment [15,16]. Importantly, mTORC1 participates to
a negative feedback that keeps the activity of PI3K under
tight control [17]. As a consequence, mTORC1 inhibition
can lead to activation of PI3K and of the pro-survival
kinase AKT [18]. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies that
avoid instauration of feedback activation of the PI3K/AKT
axis might be beneficial in long-term treatments of PET
patients with mTORC1 inhibitors.
In this work, we aimed at evaluating the response
of PET cell lines to three novel PI3K inhibitors, the
dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 [19], the pan-PI3K
inhibitor BKM120 [20] and the PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719
[21]. BEZ235 was the most efficient among the PI3K
inhibitors in limiting PET cell growth. Notably, although
BEZ235 alone did not provide an advantage with respect
to RAD001, combined treatment with these inhibitors
could overcome the resistance of PET cells to RAD001
and it significantly lowered the dose required to exert antiproliferative effects. The synergic effect relied on more
efficient inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation, consequent
impairment of the assembly of the translation initiation
complex eIF4F and strong inhibition of protein synthesis.
Thus, our results demonstrate in vitro the efficacy of
combined treatment with RAD001 and BEZ235 in PET
cells, providing the basis for studies using in vivo models
of PET.

In addition, the majority of patients that initially respond
to the treatment then develop secondary resistance
within 1 year [13]. We aimed at developing cell models
representing these clinical situations to test the effect
of three novel PI3K inhibitors in PETs. The PET cell
lines BON-1 and QGP-1 exhibit a different sensitivity
to RAD001 in terms of proliferation, with BON-1 cells
being highly sensitive to the inhibitor and QGP-1 rather
resistant [7,10]. To determine whether RAD001-sensitive
cells could acquire resistance to the drug, we treated BON1 cells with RAD001 for 8 consecutive weeks. RAD001
(10 nM) was supplied every 48 hours together with fresh
medium (Figure 1A). Treatment with RAD001 almost
completely blocked proliferation of BON-1 cells in the
first week (Supplementary Figure 1A). However, after
10-15 days of treatment cells started to grow slowly and
by the end of the treatment they exhibited a proliferation
rate in the presence of RAD001 that was comparable to
that of parental BON-1 cells in the absence of the drug
(Supplementary Figure 1B). These cells, which we
named BON-1 RR (RAD001 Resistant) for their acquired
phenotype, displayed a more elongated shape and fewer
cell-cell contacts with respect to the morphology of
parental cells (Figure 1A). Although changes in elongated
shape are often a hallmark of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition in cancer cells, as exemplified by the MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Figure 1B), we found
that this is not the case for BON-1 cells. Indeed, parental
BON-1 cells express mixed markers of both epithelial and
mesenchymal phenotype and their expression levels are
not significantly changed in BON-1 RR cells (Figure 1B).
To validate the differential sensitivity of PET
cell lines to RAD001, we performed colony formation
assays, which measure the ability of cells seeded at clonal
dilutions to form new colonies [22]. As expected, parental
BON-1 cells were highly sensitive to RAD001, with
approximately 75-90% inhibition of colony formation at
1-10 nM concentrations (Figure 1C). QGP-1 cells were
substantially resistant to the drug, which caused a 20-35%
reduction in number of colonies (Figure 1C). Strikingly,
BON-1 RR cells were strongly resistant to RAD001,
with approximately 10% reduction in colony formation at
the highest dose (Figure 1C). These results suggest that
PET cells that are sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition can
develop resistance to RAD001 treatment, similarly to what
observed in patients [5,13].

RESULTS

PI3K inhibitors display different efficacy in the
inhibition of PET cell growth.

Establishment of a PET cell model of acquired
resistance to RAD001

In various cancer cell lines, inhibition of mTORC1
activity causes a feedback activation of PI3K and
phosphorylation of AKT, resulting in a pro-survival
response [18]. To test whether such feedback control is
also active in PET cells, we treated BON-1 and QGP1

Clinical data indicate that a subset of PET patients
respond to RAD001 treatment with tumor regression or
stabilization, whereas others display primary resistance.

cells with different doses of RAD001. Notably, RAD001
induced sustained (4-24 hours) phosphorylation of AKT in
Thr 308 and Ser 473 in both PET cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 2). These results suggest that the prosurvival PI3K/
AKT pathway is activated in both RAD001-sensitive and
-resistant PET cells.
BEZ235 is a dual inhibitor that inhibits the catalytic
activity of mTOR and of all class I PI3K isoforms by
targeting their ATP binding site [19]. BKM120 acts on all
class I PI3K isoforms [20], whereas BYL719 specifically
inhibits the activity of the p110α catalytic isoform [21].
To evaluate the activity of these compounds in PET cells,
we initially tested the minimal dose of each drug required
to inhibit AKT phosphorylation and mTORC1 activity
in BON-1 and QGP-1 cells (Supplementary Figure 3).
Phosphorylation of AKT in Thr 308, which is mediated
by PDK1, was evaluated as marker of PI3K activity,
phosphorylation of AKT in Ser 473 was evaluated as
target of mTORC2 activity, whereas phosphorylation of
rpS6 and of 4EBP1 were evaluated as downstream targets
of mTORC1 (see Figure 2A for pathway representation).
In both cell lines, BEZ235 inhibited mTORC1

activity at 10 nM, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation
of rpS6 and the shift to faster electrophoretic mobility of
4EBP1 (α isoform in Figure 2B). However, at 100-250 nM
BEZ235 also impaired PI3K and mTORC2 activities, as
shown by reduced phosphorylation of AKT in Thr 308 and
Ser 473, respectively (Figure 2B). By contrast, the other
two drugs were less effective in inhibiting these pathways
and required much higher dosage (Supplementary Figure
3A,B). BKM120 inhibited PI3K (AKT Ser308) and
partially mTORC1/2 activities at 250-500 nM, whereas
BYL719 was active at concentrations in the micromolar
range (1-10 µM) (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure
3A,B). Specific inhibition of mTORC1 activity by
BEZ235 was also tested by monitoring phosphorylation
of mTOR in Ser 2448, a substrate of the ribosomal S6
kinase (23) that is activated by the mTORC1 complex
(15). As expected, we found that increasing doses of
BEZ235 reduced mTOR phosphorylation, whereas the
PI3K-specific inhibitors were ineffective (BKM120) or
exerted a partial effect only at high doses in the RAD001sensitive BON-1 cells 10 µM BYL719) (Supplementary
Figure 3C,D).

In order to evaluate the effect of the PI3K inhibitors
on PET cell proliferation and survival, we performed
colony formation assays. In BON-1 cells, BEZ235 did
not confer an advantage with respect to RAD001 and
suppressed colony formation at 3-10 nM concentration
(Figure 2C), a dose at which this inhibitor affected
mTORC1 activity but not PI3K activity (Figure 2B).

By contrast, in QGP-1 cells, which are rather resistant
to RAD001 and to doses of BEZ235 that inhibit only
mTORC1, increasing doses of BEZ235 significantly
inhibited colony formation and growth with respect to the
effect of RAD001 (Figure 2C). This result might indicate
that inhibition of PI3K activity overcomes RAD001
resistance in PET cell lines. However, BKM120 and

BYL719 did not suppress QGP-1 colony formation even at
doses that efficiently inhibited PI3K activity, whereas they
were more efficacious in BON-1 cells (Figure 2C). Thus,
these observations suggest that the concomitant inhibition
of mTORC1 and PI3K/mTORC2 exerted by high doses of
BEZ235 is beneficial to limit growth of RAD001-resistant
PET cells.

a significant amelioration of the effect of BEZ235 (Figure
3A,B). Direct measurement of cell proliferation and
cell death indicated that the combined treatment mainly
affected proliferation of PET cells (Supplementary Figure
4A,B). Notably, co-treatment of cells with RAD001
and BKM120, which inhibits only PI3K, did not exert a
synergic effect on PET cell proliferation (Supplementary
Figure 5). These data indicate that combined treatment of
PET cells with RAD001 and BEZ235 is more effective
with respect to the action of each drug alone. Furthermore,
the combined treatment allows lowering tenfold the
minimal concentration of both drugs required to exert
significant inhibition of PET cell growth.

Combined treatment with BEZ235 and RAD001
overcomes resistance of PET cells to RAD001
To test whether combined treatment with BEZ235
and RAD001 provides an advantage with respect to
single treatment with each drug, we evaluated their effect
in PET cells that are resistant to RAD001 alone (QGP1 and BON-1 RR cells) by colony formation assays.
As shown above (Figure 2C), QGP-1 cells were rather
resistant to BEZ235 at concentrations (1-10 nM) that
selectively inhibited mTORC1, whereas their growth
was strongly inhibited at concentrations (100-250 nM)
that also suppress PI3K and mTORC2 activity (Figure
3A). A similar result was observed for BON-1-RR cells
(Figure 3B). However, when low doses of BEZ235 (110 nM) were administered in combination with 1 nM
RAD001, growth was significantly inhibited in both
QGP-1 (~25-65% inhibition, Figure 3A) and BON-1RR (~50-80% inhibition, Figure 3B) cells. Importantly,
increasing the dose of RAD001 to 10 nM did not provide

Combined treatment with BEZ235 and RAD001
efficiently suppresses phosphorylation of AKT
and 4EBP1 in RAD001-resistant PET cells
To investigate the molecular mechanism(s)
underlying the synergic effect of BEZ235 and RAD001 in
PET cells, we performed Western blot analyses of relevant
targets of the PI3K and mTORC1 pathway. We found
that in both QGP-1 (Figure 4A) and BON-1 RR (Figure
4B), treatment with 10 nM RAD001 or 10 nM BEZ235
alone did not completely block mTORC1 activity, as
indicated by the substantial amount of high molecular
weight forms (β and γ isoforms) of its direct substrate
4EBP1. In addition, under these conditions AKT remained

phosphorylated in Thr 308 and Ser 473. By contrast,
when RAD001 and BEZ235 were administered together
(10 nM each), 4EBP1 phosphorylation was completely
suppressed, whereas AKT phosphorylation was attenuated
in QGP-1 cells (Figure 4A) and abolished in BON-1-RR
cells (Figure 4B). Similarly to what observed with the
colony formation assay, concomitant inhibition of PI3K/
mTORC2 and mTORC1 pathways could be obtained by
raising the concentration of BEZ235 alone to 100 nM.
These results suggest that the synergism between RAD001
and BEZ235 is due to more efficient inhibition of both the
PI3K/mTORC2 and the mTORC1 pathways elicited by the
combined treatment (see Discussion).

Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTORC1 inhibits its
interaction with the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E.
This allows recruitment of the scaffold protein eIF4G
and the RNA helicase eIF4A by eIF4E to form the active
eIF4F translation initiation complex at the 5’-cap of
mRNAs and triggers translation initiation [24]. To test
whether combined treatment with RAD001 and BEZ235
affected translation initiation, we performed 5’-methylcap assays to pull down eIF4E and its associated proteins
[25]. In the absence of treatment, eIF4E was associated
with substantial amount of eIF4G and eIF4A in both
QGP-1 (Figure 5A, right panel) and BON-1-RR (Figure
5B, right panel) cells, indicating efficient assembly
of eIF4F. Treatment with RAD001 or BEZ235 alone
did not significantly reduce eIF4F formation, even
though a partial de-phosphorylation of 4EBP1 was
observed in the cell extracts (Figure 5A,B, left panels).
By contrast, concomitant treatment with RAD001 and
BEZ235 completely suppressed 4EBP1 phosphorylation
and promoted its strong association with eIF4E and
disassembly of eIF4F, as demonstrated by the strong
reduction in eIF4G and eIF4A bound to eIF4E (Figure
5A,B).
The results illustrated above suggest that the effect
of combined treatment with RAD001 and BEZ235 on PET
cell growth correlates with the inhibition of translation
initiation and consequent reduction in protein synthesis.
To directly test this hypothesis, we performed metabolic
labelling of PET cells with a mix containing 35S-labeled
aminoacids to measure the effect of RAD001 and BEZ235
on protein synthesis. We found that RAD001 or BEZ235
alone had mild (QGP-1 cells, Figure 5C) or no effect
(BON-1 RR cells, Figure 5D) on protein synthesis. By
contrast, when the two inhibitors were administered in
combination, protein synthesis was strongly reduced in
both QGP-1 cells (70%, Figure 5C) and BON-1 RR cells
(55%, Figure 5D), confirming the results on the effect on
eIF4F assembly. Notably, although in QGP-1 cells each
inhibitor could slightly reduce protein synthesis, combined
treatment exerted a significantly stronger effect than each
single agent (brackets in Figure 5C), similarly to what
observed on cell growth and eIF4F assembly.
Collectively, these observations strongly indicate
that combined treatment with RAD001 and BEZ235 exerts
a synergic effect on PET cell growth through enhanced
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, impairment of
eIF4F complex assembly and consequent reduction of
protein synthesis.

Combined treatment with BEZ235 and RAD001 is
required to inhibit protein synthesis in RAD001resistant PET cells
A key function of the mTORC1 complex is the
regulation of mRNA translation initiation complex [24].

DISCUSSION

AKT and 4EBP1 in RAD001-resistant PET cells.

Everolimus (RAD001) is currently employed as first
line agent for advanced, progressive PETs [5,13,26,27].
The molecular target of RAD001 is the PI3K/AKT/
mTORC1 axis, which is often deregulated in PET patients
[13,26] and in other types of human cancers [24,28].

Unfortunately, however, a relevant number of PET patients
show a primary resistance to treatment with RAD001 or
acquire a secondary resistance after chronic exposure
[13,26]. Furthermore, clinical trials have demonstrated
that RAD001 delays but does not block PET progression
[27]. PET cell models showing sensitivity to RAD001
(BON-1) or primary resistance to the drug (QGP-1) have
been already described [7,10]. Herein, we have established
a new PET cell model for the study of acquired resistance
to RAD001. BON-1 cells were exposed to the drug
chronically for 8 weeks, until their growth rate became
similar to that of parental cells in the absence of RAD001
(BON-1-RR cells). Direct examination of the sensitivity
of BON-1 RR to RAD001 confirmed their increased
resistance to mTORC1 inhibition. Thus, we employed
BON-1, QGP-1 and BON-1-RR cells as in vitro models
of the clinical cases of PET patients to test the efficacy of
drugs that target the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 axis at different
levels.
RAD001 is a synthetic analogue (rapalog) of
rapamycin, which functions as an allosteric inhibitor of
the mTORC1 complex [29]. The sensitivity to rapalogs
has been associated to low eIF4E/4EBP1 ratios, whereas
increased eIF4E expression and/or decreased 4EBP1
expression confer resistance in cancer cells [30]. However,
we found that the eIF4E/4EBP1 ratio was not significantly
different in RAD001-sensitive (BON-1) and insensitive

(QGP-1 and BON-1 RR) PET cells (Supplementary Figure
6), suggesting that another mechanism is involved.
Adaptation of cancer cells to chronic treatment with
rapalogs has been attributed to feedback activation of the
PI3K/AKT pathway and to the consequent induction of
prosurvival responses in cancer cells [17,30]. Moreover,
for unknown reasons rapalogs efficiently block mTORC1dependent S6 kinase activation but poorly suppress
mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBPs [30]. This
weakness can be, however, overcome by new generation
mTOR inhibitors that directly target the catalytic activity
of the kinase [31,32]. Herein, we aimed at determining
whether inhibition of PI3K activity could be beneficial to
counteract growth of PET cell lines that are, or become,
resistant to rapalogs. Among the inhibitors tested, BEZ235
resulted the most efficient in terms of inhibition of the
PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway and cell proliferation.
Interestingly, BEZ235 is a dual inhibitor that targets the
catalytic activity of PI3K, mTORC1 and mTORC2 [19].
However, we found that BEZ235 apparently inhibits these
kinases at different concentrations in PET cells, with
mTORC1 activity being suppressed at 1-10 nM while
higher doses (100-250 nM) were required to inhibit PI3K
and mTORC2. Notably, BON-1 RR and QGP-1, which
show resistance to RAD001, do not respond to BEZ235
at doses that impair solely mTORC1 activity, but are
sensitive to higher doses at which PI3K and mTORC2

are also blocked. Inhibition of PI3K activity per se does
not explain the sensitivity of PET cells to high doses of
BEZ235, as the other two PI3K inhibitors tested (BKM120
and BYL719) had marginal effects on cell growth despite
their ability to suppress PI3K-dependent phosphorylation
of AKT. Thus, the higher activity of BEZ235 resides in its
ability to concomitantly suppress PI3K and mTOR activity
at higher doses.
The clinical use of BEZ235 is currently being
evaluated in a variety of solid tumors [33]. A limitation
to its employment at high doses might potentially be
represented by development of toxicity. On the other
hand, the clinical limitation of RAD001 is represented
by development of resistance in patients [13,26,27]. To
determine whether a combined treatment with RAD001
and BEZ235 could circumvent these problems, we
exposed PET cells to both drugs. Our study revealed
two important findings. First, we found that co-treatment
with the two drugs exerted a synergic effect on PET cell
proliferation, with up to 80% inhibition obtained with
doses of each compound that caused marginal effects when
supplied alone. Moreover, we found that the synergic
effect of BEZ235 was elicited at doses that efficiently
inhibited mTORC1 but not PI3K activity. This effect
might be due to the different nature of mTOR inhibition
by RAD001 and BEZ235, with the former acting
allosterically by binding to FKB12 and the latter directly
on the catalytic activity of the kinase [32]. It should also
be reminded that although at the 10 nM concentration
BEZ235 appears to selectively block mTORC1 in PET
cells, recent evidence suggest that extensive crosstalk
between the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes exist [34]
and may enhance the effect of this drug in vivo. Moreover,
since 10 nM overcomes the IC50 of BEZ235 on PI3Ks
(19), it is also possible that, although we do not detect
an inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, PI3K activity
might be partially inhibited and this could affect PET cell
proliferation. Another possibility is that BEZ235 exerts its
synergic effect by inhibiting another kinase beside PI3K
and mTOR. However, although we cannot completely
rule out this possibility, it remains unlikely, as in vitro
studies demonstrated an extreme specificity of BEZ235,
with all other kinases tested being inhibited at doses much
higher than dose employed in our study [19]. Thus, our
results suggest that targeting the mTORC1 complex with
allosteric and catalytic inhibitors synergistically impairs
PET cell proliferation. In this regard, BEZ235 may
present several advantages with respect to other catalytic
inhibitors of mTOR [30,35], because the clinical use of
BEZ235 is already in a more advanced stage (see below)
and this drug can concomitantly inhibit the PI3K pathway,
thus possibly reinforcing growth inhibition.
Previous studies in other cancer cell types indicated
that limited or absent inhibition of phosphorylation of

inhibitors targeting the kinase activity of mTOR [30,35].
However, our results indicate that combined treatment with
RAD001 and BEZ235 results in much stronger growth
inhibition than either drug alone in PET cells, suggesting
that the effect is not simply due to stronger efficacy of
catalytic inhibitors with respect to rapalogs. Other studies
also suggest that combined treatment with RAD001 and
BEZ235 may exert a synergic effect on cell survival and
proliferation in other cancer types [36,37], although the
mechanism underlying this effect was not addressed. Here,
we found that the anti-proliferative effect of the combined
therapy directly correlates with the ability to suppress
4EBP1 phosphorylation and to interfere with the assembly
of the translation initiation complex in PET cells. Indeed,
our data show that RAD001 and BEZ235 used as single
agents only partially reduced phosphorylation of 4EBP1
and interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G and eIF4A, whereas
they abolished 4EBP1 phosphorylation and eIF4F
assembly when administered together. This effect is
biologically relevant, as it was reflected in a much stronger
inhibition of protein synthesis in BON-1 RR and QGP-1
cells with respect to cells treated with RAD001 or BEZ235
alone. Thus, concomitant allosteric and catalytic inhibition
of mTORC1 is necessary to efficiently circumvent primary
and secondary resistance to RAD001 in PET cell lines.
BEZ235 is currently under evaluation in a clinical
trial that investigates its use in patients with advanced
PETs after failure of RAD001 (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier:NCT01658436). In this regard, we found that
BEZ235 had minor effects on RAD001-resistant PET
cells at doses at which it completely suppressed mTORC1dependent S6K activity. This result suggests that acquired
resistance to rapalogs in PET cells cannot be overcome
by treatment with catalytic inhibitors of mTORC1. By
contrast, increasing the dose of BEZ235 to 100 nM, at
which PI3K and mTORC2 activities are also inhibited,
strongly suppressed PET cell growth. Thus, BEZ235
might be beneficial as second line agent but it is likely
that the high dosage required for cell growth inhibition
will cause unwanted responses in patients. Nevertheless,
our findings suggest that addition of low doses of
RAD001 may strongly sensitize PET cells to BEZ235
and potentially limit the onset of adverse responses in
patients, as the combined therapy reduced the dose of each
drug required to obtain efficient tumor growth inhibition
in vitro. Notably, such strategy is under evaluation in
different solid tumors [33], but not in PETs to the best of
our knowledge.
In conclusion, our study suggests that combined
therapy with RAD001 and BEZ235 might be particularly
beneficial to patients that become insensitive to RAD001
treatment and provide the basis to test this hypothesis in a
preclinical model of PET in vivo.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

was used as loading control to normalize the samples.
Secondary IgGs conjugated with horseradish peroxidise
(1:10 000; Amersham Bioscience) were incubated
for 1 hour and signals were detected by enhanced
chemioluminescence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Inhibitors
RAD001 and the PI3K inhibitors (BEZ235,
BKM120 and BYL719) were generously provided by
Novartis Oncology (Basel, Swiss). Inhibitors were
dissolved in dymethil sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma- Aldrich),
and the stock solutions were diluted to final concentrations
in medium.

Colony Formation Assay
Single-cell suspensions were plated in 35mm plates
at low density (1000 cells/plate) [22]. After 1 day, cells
were treated with inhibitors as indicated in the figures.
The medium was changed every 48 hours and inhibitors
were added at every change of medium. After 10 days,
cells were fixed in methanol for 10 minutes and stained
overnight with 5% Giemsa. Plates were then washed twice
with PBS and dried. Pictures were acquired using digital
camera to count the colonies. Results represent the mean
± s.d. of three experiments.

Cell cultures, treatments and extracts preparation
BON-1 and QGP-1 cells were cultured as previously
described [10,38]. BON-1 RR (RAD001-Resistant) cells
were obtained after chronic treatment with RAD001 for
eight weeks. During treatment, 10 nM RAD001 was added
to the cell culture every 48 hours.
For western blot analysis, cells were seeded at
70% of confluence. After 24h medium was changed and
inhibitors was added to the cultures. After incubation,
cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and resuspended in lysis buffer (100mM
NaCl, 15mM MgCl2, 30mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1mM
dithiothreitol, 2mM Na-ortovanadate, Protease-Inhibitor
Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% Triton X-100). Cells
were incubated on ice for 10 minutes and protein extracts
were separated by centrifugation at 12000g, resuspended
in SDS-page sample buffer and boiled for 5 minutes
before using them for SDS-PAGE analysis.

Cell Count and viability Assay
Cell count was used to monitor cell proliferation.
BON-1 RR and QGP-1 were seeded at 40000 cells/plate in
24-well plates and treated for 72 hours as described. At the
end of treatments, cells were washed in PBS, trypsinized
and counted using the Thoma’s chamber.
For apoptosis assays, cells were seeded at 80 000
cells/plate in 12-well plates and treated with inhibitors
as indicated. Cells were fixed for 10 minutes in 4%
paraforlmaldeyde (PFA) and permeabilized with 0,1%
Triton X-100 for 10 minutes. After 1 hour with PBS
with 3% BSA, cells processed for immunofluorescence
analysis using the anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (1:400
dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Cells were incubated with secondary antibody (1:500
dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Five
random fields were chosen and at least 100 cells/field
were counted. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three
experiment performed in triplicate.

RT-PCR Analysis
Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and 1μg was used for retrotranscribed (RT)
using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Five
percent of the RT reaction was used as template for PCR
analysis (GoTaq, Promega). The sequences of all primers
used are listed in Supplemental Table 1.

7-Methyl-GTP-Sepharose Chromatography
Assembly of eIF4F complex was evaluated
essentially as previously described [10,25]. Briefly,
PET cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (see above)
containing 0,5% Triton X-100 and 30 U/mL RNasin
(Promega). Cell extracts were incubated for 10 minutes
on ice and centrifuged at 12000g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
The supernatant fractions were pre-precleared for 1 hour
on Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and then centrifuged
at 1000g for 1 minute. Pre-cleared supernatants were then
incubated with 7-Methyl-GTP Sepharose (Amersham
Bioscience) for 90 minutes at 4 °C under constant shaking.
After three washes in lysis buffer, bound protein were

SDS- PAGE and Western blot analyses
Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and
analysed by Western blot as previously described [38].
The primary antibodies used are: rabbit anti-actin (1:1000,
Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-4E-BP1 (1:1000), rabbit
anti-4EBP1 pSer65 (1:500), rabbit anti-eIF4E (1:1000),
rabbit anti-eIF4G (1:1000), rabbit anti-AKT pThr308
(1:200), rabbit anti-rpS6 pSer240-244 (1:1000), rabbit
anti-rpS6 pSer235-236 (1:1000) (all from Cell Signalling
Technology); rabbit anti-pSer473 AKT (1:1000) (from
BioSource); rabbit anti-eIF4A (1:1000) (Abcam). Actin

Protein Synthesis Assay.
For the measurement of protein synthesis rate, 2x105
cells were plated in 35 mm dishes in presence of inhibitors
as indicated. In the last 30 minutes [35S]-cell labelling mix
(Perkin Elmer EasyTag ™ Express35S35S, 1000 Ci/nmol)
was added to final concentration of 10 ɥCi/mL. Cells were
lysed in High Salt Buffer (HSB) (Tris HCl pH 7.5 50 mM,
NaCl 350 mM, MgCl2 1 mM, EDTA 0,5 mM, EGTA 0,1
mM) with 1% NP-40) and proteins were precipitated in
10% trichloroacetic acid. After three washes with 5%
cold thricloroacetic acid, the insoluble materials was
collected on GFC filters (Whatman) and the incorporated
radioactivity was measured in scintillation fluid. Results
represent mean ± s.d. of three experiments.
