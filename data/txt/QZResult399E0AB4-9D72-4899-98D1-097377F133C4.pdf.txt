ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignant tumors
worldwide and effective therapies, including molecular therapy, remain elusive.
Our previous work demonstrates that oncogenic KIAA0101 transcript variant (tv)
1 promotes HCC development and might be a HCC therapeutic target. However, the
function of another KIAA0101 variant, KIAA0101 tv2, remains unknown. In this study,
we reported that KIAA0101 tv2 was highly expressed in adjacent non-tumorous liver
tissues (NTs) compared to HCC tissues. In vivo and in vitro results showed that
KIAA0101 tv2 decreased cell survival, colony formation, tumor xenografts, migration,
and invasion, as well as induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, it could
inhibit the function of KIAA0101 tv1 by partially down-regulating KIAA0101 tv1,
acting similar to KIAA0101 tv1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Further studies illustrated
that KIAA0101 tv2 could increase the activity of p53 by competing with KIAA0101
tv1 for P53 binding. In conclusion, KIAA0101 tv2 exerts anti-tumor activity in HCC
and acts as an endogenous competitor of tumor-associated KIAA0101 tv1. KIAA0101
tv2 has a potential to work as a therapeutic drug targeting the KIAA0101 tv1 in HCC.

KIAA0101, which regulates DNA replication, DNA
repair, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation [5–9], is
associated with the development of several cancers [9–13]
and predicts poor progression in different types of cancers
[13–16]. Suppression of KIAA0101 is likely to be a strategy
for cancer therapy [9, 12, 17]. According to the data from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),
KIAA0101 (Gene ID: 9768) has two major transcript
variants (tv), designated KIAA0101 tv1 and tv2. Currently,
all the studies regarding KIAA0101 focus on KIAA0101
tv1. Our previous study elucidated that KIAA0101 tv1
promoted cell survival by inhibiting p53 in HCC cells [12].
However, there is no report on KIAA0101 tv2 function.
Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs is an
essential process for gene expression regulation and

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer is the second most lethal malignance
worldwide, with more than half a million new cases
diagnosed annually [1]. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
represents 90% of the total liver cancer cases, resulting in
approximately 500,000 deaths per year [2]. Most patients
with HCC are diagnosed with advanced disease due to its
aggressive properties. Therapy options for most advanced
HCC cases are limited. The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib
is the only systemic therapy for advanced HCC, suggesting
that molecular therapy could be effective for HCC. However,
sorafenib treatment only extends the median life expectancy
of patients for 1 year [3, 4]. As a result, it is urgent to explore
specific molecular targeted therapies for HCC.

contributes to proteome diversity in eukaryotes. It is
also a process frequently deregulated during cancer
progression [18, 19]. An increasing number of studies
have reported that alternatively spliced isoforms may
have related, distinct or even opposing functions [20,
21]. Hence, isoform-selective inhibitors are emerging as
potential components for precision medical treatments
[22, 23]. Furthermore, accumulating evidence shows that
aberrant AS may regulate gene functions by generating
endogenous inhibitor isoforms [24–27], which might
be a new strategy for isoform-selective inhibitors.
However, there has been no report exploring whether
KIAA0101 tv2 could be an endogenous KIAA0101
tv1 inhibitor or competitor. As a result, studies on the
function of KIAA0101 tv2 and its role in KIAA0101
tv1 regulation might provide a novel strategy for HCC
molecular therapy.
In this study, we explored the expression pattern
of KIAA0101 tv2 in HCCs and adjacent non-tumorous
liver tissues (NTs). Moreover, the function and potential
molecular mechanism of KIAA0101 tv2 on inhibition
of HCC progression were revealed. In addition, the
KIAA0101 tv2 regulation of KIAA0101 tv1 and its
elementary molecular mechanism were also investigated.
This study provides novel insights into the development of
innovative strategies for HCC therapy.

KIAA0101 tv2 is highly expressed in NTs
compared to HCCs
Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were
performed to study the correlation between KIAA0101 tv2
expression and HCC using paired tissues from 42 patients.
KIAA0101 tv2 was highly expressed in 73.8% (31/42) of
NTs and only in 28.6% (12/42) of HCC tissues by western
blot (Figure 1A-1B, Table 1, P<0.005). IHC also showed
KIAA0101 tv2-positive expression in 76.2% (32/42)
of NTs and in 31.0% (13/42) of HCC tissues (P<0.005)
(Figure 1C-1D). These results indicate that KIAA0101 tv2
was highly expressed in NTs compared to HCC tissues.

KIAA0101 tv2 shows opposite effect on cell
proliferation and transformation compared with
KIAA0101 tv1
In our previous study, KIAA0101 tv1 was shown
to be overexpressed in HCC tissues and exerted the
properties of an oncogenic gene in HCC [12]. Because
KIAA0101 tv2 was highly expressed in NTs compared to
HCC, which was opposite to KIAA0101 tv1 expression,
we explored whether the effects of KIAA0101 tv2

expression on cell proliferation and transformation were
also opposite to those of KIAA0101 tv1. Crystal violet
assays showed that KIAA0101 tv2 significantly inhibited
the viability of NIH3T3 cells by 18.2% (P<0.001)
compared to the control, whereas KIAA0101 tv1
increased the cell viability 1.5-fold (P<0.001) compared
to the control (Supplementary Figure 1A). KIAA0101 tv2
function was also investigated in HCC cell lines (HepG2
and HepG2.2.15, which show abnormal expression of
KIAA0101 tv1). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted
to KIAA0101 tv1 (shKIAA0101 tv1) was used as a
positive control. KIAA0101 tv2 significantly decreased
the proliferation rates in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells,
at levels comparable to that in the control cells (Figure
2A). These results imply that KIAA0101 tv2 exhibits
an opposing role to KIAA0101 tv1 on cell viability and
proliferation.
Colony formation assays revealed that few
foci were observed in NIH3T3-KIAA0101 tv2 cells
compared to HepG2 cells (Supplementary Figure 1B,
P<0.001). Similarly, fewer foci formed after transfection
with KIAA0101 tv2 compared to empty vector in
HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells using colony formation
assays. A similar result was obtained in the positive
control (Figure 2B, P<0.001). Furthermore, NIH3T3KIAA0101 tv2 cells failed to form tumors on the flank
of nude mice (Supplementary Figure 1C, P<0.001),
indicating that KIAA0101 tv2 failed to induce NIH3T3
cell transformation. HepG2-KIAA0101 tv2 and HepG2shKIAA0101 tv1 cells restricted tumor formation on the
flank of nude mice (Figure 2C, Supplementary Table
1). These results implicate KIAA0101 tv2 similar to
shKIAA0101 tv1 in the inhibition of HCC cell oncogenic
potential.

2A). Overexpression of KIAA0101 tv2 significantly
inhibited wound closure in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells
(P<0.05) (Figure 3A). This result was consistent with that
of shRNA-mediated KIAA0101 tv1 knockdown, which
showed significant reduction in migration rate (P<0.05)
(Figure 3A).
Furthermore, both cell migration and invasion were
enhanced by KIAA0101 tv1 overexpression in NIH3T3
cells (Supplementary Figure 2B-2C). In striking contrast,
KIAA0101 tv2 overexpression significantly reduced
cell migration and invasion in both NIH3T3 and HepG2
cells, as well as in KIAA0101 tv1-depleted HepG2 cells
(Supplementary Figure 2B-2C and Figure 3B-3C).
Our results suggest that KIAA0101 tv2, unlike
KIAA0101 tv1, fails to promote NIH3T3 cells migration
and invasion. Moreover, KIAA0101 tv2 inhibits these
malignant properties of HCC cells as shKIAA0101 tv1.

Overexpression of KIAA0101 tv2 induces cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis
Our previous study found that KIAA0101 tv1
protected HepG2 cells from doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis [12]. Here we examined the role of KIAA0101
tv2 in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Flow
cytometry revealed a 22.6% (P<0.001) decrease in
the percentage of cells in the G2/M and S phases in
NIH3T3-KIAA0101 tv2 cells. However, KIAA0101 tv1
overexpression dramatically increased the percentage
of cells in the G2/M and S phases to 1.4-fold (P<0.001)
(Figure 4A). Furthermore, KIAA0101 tv2 overexpression
significantly decreased the percentage of HepG2 and
HepG2.2.15 cells in G2/M and S phases (P<0.001),
similar to shKIAA0101 tv1 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15
cells (Figure 4B). Thus, KIAA0101 tv2, analogous to
shKIAA0101 tv1, may plays a role in suppressing cell
cycle progression.
Flow cytometry also showed a significant increase
in the rate of apoptosis in KIAA0101 tv2-overexpressing
HepG2 cells (Figure 4C, P<0.05). These results
demonstrate that KIAA0101 tv2 overexpression can
induce HCC cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

KIAA0101 tv2 is antagonistic to KIAA0101 tv1
during cell migration and invasion
There is increasing evidence that KIAA0101
promotes cell migration and invasion in several types of
cancer cells, including renal carcinoma, gastric cancer,
and esophageal cancer [10, 11, 15]. However, the roles
of KIAA0101 tv2 in HCC cell migration and invasion
are still unknown. Wound healing assays demonstrated
that KIAA0101 tv2 overexpression inhibited wound
closure in NIH3T3 cells by 35.1% (P=0.003<0.005).
Conversely, KIAA0101 tv1 strongly improved the wound
closure by 1.6-fold (P<0.001) (Supplementary Figure

with our observations above, we explored whether
the KIAA0101 tv1 expression levels were effected by
KIAA0101 tv2 overexpression. As shown in Figure 5A5B, overexpression of KIAA0101 tv2 significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of KIAA0101
tv1 in both HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. These results
suggest that KIAA0101 tv2 can down-regulate the
expression of KIAA0101 tv1 in HCC cells.

To examine whether KIAA0101 tv2 effects the
expression of KIAA0101 tv1 through regulating the
KIAA0101 promoter activity, HepG2 cells were transiently
co-transfected with the KIAA0101 promoter/luciferase
reporter and pcDNA3.1(-)-KIAA0101 tv2 plasmid.
Luciferase activity assays showed an approximately 34.6%
(P<0.001) reduction in KIAA0101 promoter activity induced
by KIAA0101 tv2 (Figure 5C). Therefore, KIAA0101 tv2

inhibited the transcriptional activity of p53 [12]. In
this study, we found KIAA0101 tv2 down-regulated
the expression of KIAA0101 tv1 and promoted HepG2
cell apoptosis. To verify the relationship between these
roles of KIAA0101 tv2 and the activity of cell signaling
pathways, KIAA0101 tv2 was overexpressed in HepG2
cells. Then, we examined the changes in expression of the
tumor suppressor p53 and its downstream target genes.

activity of p53 in HepG2 cells
Our previous work showed that KIAA0101

As shown in Figure 6A-6B, the total expression levels of
p53 and its target genes (such as BAX, NOXA, PUMA,
and p21) were increased in HepG2-KIAA0101 tv2 cells.
P53 modifications at both Ser46 and Lys382 are necessary
for p53 transcription during apoptosis [28]. Furthermore,
phosphorylation of P53 at S46 is required for P53-K382
acetylation [29]. Therefore, we also detected the level of
P53-K382 acetylation and P53-S46 phosphorylation. Our
results showed that KIAA0101 tv2 could increase both
K382 acetylation and S46 phosphorylation of P53 (Figure
6B). These data indicate that KIAA0101 tv2 may exert an
anti-tumor effect in HCC by increasing the transcriptional
activity of p53.

analysis. As shown in Figure 7A, KIAA0101 tv2 and
P53 interacted, suggesting that KIAA0101 tv2 forms a
complex with P53.
In our previous study, KIAA0101 tv1 was shown
to physically interact with the p53 protein [12]. Since
both KIAA0101 tv2 and tv1 could bind to p53, we
tested whether there was a competitive effect between
KIAA0101 tv2 and tv1. The same amount of KIAA0101
tv1 and p53 plasmids were co-transfected with increasing
amounts of Flag-tagged KIAA0101 tv2 plasmids into
HEK293T cells. Increasing concentrations of FlagKIAA0101 tv2 increased the interaction between P53 and
KIAA0101 tv2 and decreased the binding between P53
and KIAA0101 tv1 (Figure 7B).

NS5ATP9 (HCV NS5A-transactivated protein 9), was
initially identified as a proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) associated protein [30–32]. It is a transcription
factor that regulates several target genes involved in the
modulation of cellular processes such as DNA replication,
DNA repair, proliferation and cell cycle regulation [5, 6,
9, 33]. KIAA0101 overexpression is associated with the
development of several cancers, including pancreatic
cancer [9], renal cell carcinoma [10], esophageal cancer
[11], primary lung cancer [13], and HCC [16].

There are two main variants derived from the AS
of KIAA0101 pre-mRNA (KIAA0101 tv1+Ex3; KIAA0101
tv2-Ex3) according to NCBI. Compared to KIAA0101 tv1,
KIAA0101 tv2 lacks exon 3, which contains a conserved
PCNA binding motif known as a PIP-box [32]. Transcripts
from more than 90% of human multi-exon genes undergo
AS [34]. Aberrant AS is proposed as a crucial mechanism
in the development of cancer [20, 35]. Increasing evidence
shows that spliced variants exert distinctive expression
patterns in different types of cancers [36–38]. Our study

plasmids. Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using the anti-FLAG antibody and subsequently IB with anti-P53 and anti-KIAA0101 tv1
antibodies. Cell lysate was also immunoprecipitated using anti-P53 antibody and then IB with antibodies against P53, Flag, and KIAA0101
tv1. Densitometric analysis presented as mean ± SEM. IP lysate (5%) was used as input.

also showed that KIAA0101 tv1 was overexpressed in
HCCs compared to NTs, especially in late stage HCC
[12], whereas KIAA0101 tv2 was highly expressed in NTs
compared to HCCs (Figure 1 and Table 1), suggesting the
expression pattern of KIAA0101 variants were opposite
in HCC.
Differentially expressed variants in cancer and nononcogenic cells may play disparate roles [38, 39], so we
hypothesized that KIAA0101 tv2 might have distinct
functions from tv1 in HCC. We previously found that
KIAA0101 tv1 could promote NIH3T3 cells proliferation,
colony formation, and tumor xenografts in nude mice [12].
It could also protect cells against doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis [12]. Interestingly, our data showed KIAA0101
tv2 failed to promote NIH3T3 cells proliferation, colony
formation, tumor xenografts in nude mice, cell motility,
and invasion (Supplementary Figure 1, 2), suggesting
KIAA0101 tv2 did not possess the oncogenic properties
of KIAA0101 tv1. Additionally, several reports show the
opposing roles of spliced variants from the same gene
in cancer [26, 40, 41]. We also found KIAA0101 tv2
could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, as well as
inhibit the malignant properties in HCC cells (Figure 2,
3, 4), indicating that KIAA0101 tv2 might have tumor
suppressor properties opposite to KIAA0101 tv1.
Alterations in the splicing patterns of genes
may contribute to the regulation of gene functions by
generating endogenous inhibitor isoforms [24–27]. For
instance, Basigin-3 inhibits cell invasion by interacting
with Basigin-2, which promotes cell invasion in HCC,
as an endogenous inhibitor [26]. Interestingly, our data
revealed that KIAA0101 tv2 inhibited the expression of
KIAA0101 tv1 by suppressing the KIAA0101 promoter
activity in HCC cells (Figure 5). The function of
KIAA0101 tv2 is similar to shKIAA0101 tv1 in inhibiting
the malignant potential of KIAA0101 tv1 in HCC (Figure
2, 3). Thus, our results imply that KIAA0101 tv2 might
be the endogenous negative regulator of KIAA0101 tv1.
Endogenous regulators exert their function through
regulation of the variants involved in signaling pathways
[24, 25]. Our previous study showed that KIAA0101
tv1 inhibited the transactivation of p53 [12]. Hence,
we explored whether KIAA0101 tv2 could regulate
the transactivation of p53. In this study, we found that
KIAA0101 tv2 overexpression significantly up-regulated
the expression of total p53 and its target genes, the
acetylation level of P53 at K382 and the phosphorylation
level of P53-S46 (Figure 6). These results indicate that
the p53 transactivation activity was increased, which
mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The KIAA0101
tv2 regulation of p53 was opposite to tv1, as well [12].
KIAA0101 tv2 physically interacted with p53 by
competing with KIAA0101 tv1 (Figure 7). KIAA0101
tv2 exerts anti-tumor activity in HCC as an endogenous
competitor of oncogenic KIAA0101 tv1. KIAA0101
tv2 could be used as a negative regulator of KIAA0101

tv1 in HCC molecular therapy. In addition, it provides
a potential isoform-selective therapeutic target for HCC
treatment, which could improve efficacy while reducing
the undesirable side effects.
In conclusion, KIAA0101 tv2 is overexpressed in
NTs compared to HCC, and exerts different expression
patterns from KIAA0101 tv1 in HCC tissues. It possesses
tumor suppressor properties and inhibits the expression
and function of KIAA0101 tv1 in HCC, similar to
KIAA0101 tv1 shRNA. Consequently, KIAA0101
tv2 could serve as a competitor of KIAA0101 tv1 that
suppresses the malignant properties of KIAA0101 tv1
in HCC development. Furthermore, developing novel
isoform-selective drugs in HCC is a promising strategy,
which will provide opportunities for precision medicinebased therapies. At the same time, it could also provide
novel insights into developing innovative strategies for
HCC therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue specimens
Paired HCC tissues from 42 patients were
obtained from Ren-Min Hospital of Wuhan University
in China from 2014 to 2016. Sample collections were
under consensus agreements, and were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Wuhan University, School
of Medicine. The samples were stored at –80°C until
experiments were performed.

Western blot
Protein samples (50 μg) were separated in
4% to 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane (Amersharm Pharmacia
Biotech, San Francisco, CA). Western blot was
performed as formed standard procedures using the
primary goat polyclonal antibody against KIAA0101

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Colony formation assay and tumor xenograft
assay

IHC stainings were carried out as described
previously [12] using the primary rabbit polyclonal
antibody against KIAA0101 tv2 (NBP-80555, Novus
Biologicals). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(7074, Cell Signaling Technology) was used as secondary
antibody.

NIH3T3, HepG2 and/or HepG2.2.15 cells
were transfected with indicated plasmid, and were
maintained in 400 μg/ml of G418 at 24 h post
transfection. G418-resistant colonies were isolated after
3-4 weeks of selection. The colony formation assay and
tumor xenograft assay were performed as described
previously [12].

Plasmids construction
The KIAA0101 tv2 coding regions was cloned
into the BamHI and HindIII sites of vector pcDNA3.1(-)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and pCMV-Tag 2B
(Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1(-)-KIAA0101 tv2 and
Flag-KIAA0101 tv2 respectively using the primers P1Forword and P1-Reverse (Supplementary Table 2).
The KIAA0101 promoter was amplified by primers
P2-Forword and P2-Reverse, and then subcloned into the
luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) to create pGL3-KIAA0101.
All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

Wound healing assay
Cells were cultured to confluent in six-well plates.
24 h after transfection with indicated plasmids, cells
were entertained serum starvation (DEME supplemented
with 1% FBS) for another 24 h. Then linear wounds
were created by scratching the monolayer with a
standard 200  μl pipette tip. Cells migration into the
wound area was monitored using an inverted phase
contrast microscope (Olympus CH-40; Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan) at the time the wound was created and each 24
h later. Four different equidistant points were measured
for each plate. The migration rate was calculated as
the proportion of the mean distance between both
borderlines after closure versus the mean distance
measured at 0 h for each plate.

Cell culture and transfection
HepG2 and mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 were
purchased from the Cell Bank of Shanghai institute of Cell
Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China)
in 2011; HepG2.2.15 cell line (derived from HepG2 cells
transfected with a plasmid carrying two head-to-tail
copies of the HBV genome DNA serotype ayw, genotype
D) was obtained from XiangYa Cell Center of Central
South University (Changsha, China) in 2010. These
cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (GIBCO BRL, MD, USA) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/
ml streptomycin sulfate at 37°C in 5% CO2; HepG2.2.15
cells were additionally maintained in medium containing
380 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA). These
cell lines have been tested to be mycoplasm-free and
authenticated by their examination of morphology and
growth profile. HepG2 was additionally authenticated
by the Cell Bank of Shanghai institute of Cell Biology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences using short tandem repeat
pro-filing.
Cells were transiently transfected with indicated
plasmid(s) DNA for 48 h using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacture’s protocol.

Transwell migration assay and matrigel invasion
assay
Transwell migration assay and matrigel invasion
assay were done using 24-well Transwell with an 8 μm
diameter pore membrane (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA)
as described previously [42]. For matrigel invasion assay,
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) diluted
to 200 μg/ml was used. After incubation at 37°C for 24 h,
the cells adhered to the lower surface were fixed, stained
with crystal violet, and counted under a light microscope
(Olympus CH-40). Four fields in four separate quadrants
of each membrane were counted and averaged.

Flow cytometry
For cell cycle detection, approximately 106 cells
were harvested and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol
at –20°C overnight. Cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with staining solution containing 40 μg of
propidium iodide (PI)/ml and 100 μg of RNase A/ml. After
15 min of incubation at 4°C, DNA content was determined
by using a Beckman Coulter Epics Altra with Expo32
software (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).
For apoptosis assay, the cells were stained with
Annexin V/PI after washed with PBS. Then apoptosis was
detected with a flow cytometer.

Crystal violet assay
Cells were lysed with 1% SDS for 30 min and
absorbance was read at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC; Thermo Scientific,
Wilmington, DE, USA). The percentage of cell survival
was defined as the relative absorbance versus cells
transiently transfected with empty vector.
