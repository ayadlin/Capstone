ABSTRACT
The deregulation of Polo-like kinase 1 is inversely linked to the prognosis of
patients with diverse human tumors. Targeting Polo-like kinase 1 has been widely
considered as one of the most promising strategies for molecular anticancer therapy.
While the preclinical results are encouraging, the clinical outcomes are rather less
inspiring by showing limited anticancer activity. It is thus of importance to identify
molecules and mechanisms responsible for the sensitivity of Polo-like kinase 1
inhibition. We have recently shown that p21Cip1/CDKN1A is involved in the regulation
of mitosis and its loss prolongs the mitotic duration accompanied by defects in
chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in various tumor cells. In the present
study, we demonstrate that p21 affects the efficacy of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitors,
especially Poloxin, a specific inhibitor of the unique Polo-box domain. Intriguingly,
upon treatment with Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitors, p21 is increased in the cytoplasm,
associated with anti-apoptosis, DNA repair and cell survival. By contrast, deficiency of
p21 renders tumor cells more susceptible to Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition by showing
a pronounced mitotic arrest, DNA damage and apoptosis. Furthermore, long-term
treatment with Plk1 inhibitors induced fiercely the senescent state of tumor cells
with functional p21. We suggest that the p21 status may be a useful biomarker for
predicting the efficacy of Plk1 inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

cytokinesis promoting genomic instability [7].
The Polo-like kinase (Plk) family is a group
of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases. Five
mammalian family members have been identified: Plk1,
Plk2 (SNK), Plk3 (FNK or PRK), Plk4 (SAK) and Plk5
[8]. Plk1, the best studied member, is a key regulator of
different cell cycle events and critical for multiple stages
of mitosis including mitotic entry, spindle formation,
chromosome segregation and cytokinesis [9]. Moreover,
the overexpression of Plk1 in various tumor tissues is
closely correlated with the poor prognosis of patients,
and has been thus regarded as one of the most promising
targets for molecular anticancer therapy [10,11]. The
effect of Plk1 inhibition is well characterized, it induces
mitotic arrest and apoptosis, leading further to a reduced
proliferation in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo
[10]. The two functional domains of Plk1, the N-terminal
kinase domain and C-terminal regulatory Polo-box

The Cdk-interacting protein p21Cip1/CDKN1A (p21)
plays key roles in a broad range of cellular events like cell
cycle regulation, apoptosis, differentiation, cytoskeletal
dynamics, cell migration, gene transcription, DNA
repair, reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells,
aging and onset of senescence [1]. The transcription
of p21 is regulated by p53-dependent [2] as well as
‑independent pathways [3]. Its expression is increased in
response to various cellular stresses like DNA damage
[4]. Interestingly, p21 functions not only as a tumor
suppressor but also as an oncogene with a dual behaviour
in different cellular processes [5,6], partially depending
on its subcellular localization [1]. We have recently shown
that p21 is important for a fine-tuned mitotic progression,
its loss prolongs the duration of mitosis and results in
severe mitotic defects in chromosome segregation and

domain (PBD) [10], offer multiple targeting strategies
for developing specific small molecule compounds: (a)
inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase
domain, like BI 2536 [12,13] and BI 6727 (volasertib)
[14,15], (b) inhibitors against the inactive conformation
of the kinase domain, like SBE13 [16,17], and (c)
inhibitors blocking the function of the unique PBD, like
Poloxin [18]. In previous studies we have demonstrated
that Poloxin, the first non-peptidic PBD inhibitor,
specifically inhibits the Plk1-PBD, with a four-fold IC50
for the Plk2-PBD and an eleven-fold IC50 value for the
Plk3-PBD in vitro [18]. Moreover, Poloxin targets Plk1
in a panel of cancer cell lines with a high specificity by
showing prometaphase arrest, delocalization of Plk1 itself,
reduction of γ‑tubulin recruitment to centrosomes, defects
in the mitotic spindle formation, activation of the spindle
assembly checkpoint and induction of apoptosis, and it
inhibits tumor growth in vivo [18-20].
Despite inspiring results of Plk1 inhibitors in vitro,
the clinical data are less promising [11]. It is of importance
to identify biomarkers, which contribute to the cytotoxicity

of Plk1 inhibitors and help to select suitable cancer
patients for this molecular intervention. Recently, we
have reported that the cytotoxic response of various Plk1
inhibitors does not correlate with deficient p53, at least
not in a direct manner, as functional p53 is required for an
effective apoptosis induction upon Plk1 inhibition [21].
Since p21, the downstream effector of the p53 pathway,
is involved in the regulation of proliferation, mitosis,
apoptosis, stress response and survival, we wondered if the
loss of functional p21 could affect the cytotoxicity of Plk1
inhibitors. In the present work, we have systematically
addressed this issue.

RESULTS
HCT116 p21-/- cells respond more strongly to
Plk1 inhibitors than HCT116 p21+/+ cells
To address if the p21 status is a direct factor for the
efficacy of Plk1 inhibitors, we have chosen the isogenic

Figure 1: HCT116 p21-/- cells respond strongly to small molecule inhibitors against Plk1. (A-C) HCT116 cells were seeded

in 96-well plates and treated with (A) 10, 15 or 25 µM Poloxin, (B) 5, 15 or 25 nM BI 2536 and (C) 15, 25 or 50 nM BI 6727 for 0, 24, 48
and 72 h. Cell viability was measured via CellTiter-Blue® assay. DMSO treated cells served as vehicle control. The results are presented as

colon cancer cell lines HCT116 p21+/+ and HCT116 p21/-, as they contain comparable cellular context except the
p21 status and are very well characterized [22]. Using
these cell lines, we tested the efficiency of the kinase
domain inhibitors BI 2536 and BI 6727 [12-15] and the
PBD inhibitor Poloxin [18-20]. While the BI inhibitors,
like other inhibitors against a kinase domain, are highly
potent, Poloxin, like other inhibitors targeting the protein
binding domain, is specific yet less sensitive. HCT116
cells were treated with various concentrations of different
Plk1 inhibitors for 24, 48 and 72 h, followed by cellular
viability assays. HCT116 p21-/- cells expanded more
slowly (Fig. 1A, B and C, right panel) than HCT116
p21+/+ cells (Fig. 1A, B and C, left panel), as previously
described [7]. Interestingly, HCT116 p21‑/- cells were
obviously more sensitive to Poloxin by showing a strong
inhibition of proliferation after the treatment with 10 µM
Poloxin over 72 h and almost no proliferation upon 15 and
25 µM Poloxin (Fig. 1A, right panel), while HCT116 cells
with p21 showed a moderate inhibition of proliferation
even at 15 µM Poloxin (Fig. 1A, left panel). The IC50
calculation clearly accentuates the difference between
these two cell lines upon Poloxin treatment for 72 h: the
values were 19.35 µM for HCT116 p21+/+ and 11.98
µM for HCT116 p21-/- cells. Furthermore, both cell lines
responded to BI 2536 and BI 6727 with a high sensitivity
(Fig. 1B and C). A slightly enhanced proliferative
inhibition was observed in HCT116 p21-/- cells treated
with BI 6727 (Fig. 1C). The reduced viability in HCT116
p21-/- cells upon Plk1 inhibition was also observed by
consecutive images of bright-field microscopy (Fig. S1).

Plk1 depletion triggered a more pronounced G2/M peak in
HCT116 p21-/- cells compared to HCT116 p21+/+ cells
(Fig. 2D). Further analysis showed that 79.6% of HCT116
p21-/- cells and 55.2% of HCT116 p21+/+ cells arrested
at G2/M upon Plk1 depletion (Fig. 2E). The data are in
line with our previous observations that p21 is required
for a fine-tuned mitotic progression and cells deficient in
p21 faced more troubles in mitosis, in particular, under
stressful situations [7].

Mitotic phenotype of HCT116 p21+/+ and
HCT116 p21-/- cells upon Plk1 inhibitor treatment
Next we were interested in the mitotic phenotype
induced by Plk1 inhibitors. Cells were treated for 24 h and
stained for the microtubule marker tubulin, the centrosome
marker
pericentrin,
the
centromere/kinetochore
marker ACA (anti-centrosome antibody) and DNA for
microscopic evaluation. Compared to DMSO treated cells
(Fig. 3A and B, 1st panel), Poloxin and BI 2536 induced
mainly monopolar spindles (Fig. 3A, 2nd and 3rd panel,
Fig. 3B, 2nd to 4th panel), whereas BI 6727 produced
primarily multipolar spindles (Fig. 3A and B, 5th panel).
Strikingly, all three inhibitors generated distinctively
more monopolar spindles in HCT116 p21-/- cells relative
to HCT116 p21+/+ cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that loss
of p21 strengths monopolar spindle formation induced
by Plk1 inhibition. By contrast, the two BI inhibitors
induced more aberrant spindles, defined as disorganized
but bipolar spindles, in HCT116 p21+/+ cells (Fig. 3D).
In addition, treatment with BI 6727 resulted in multipolar
spindles which were more remarkable in HCT116 p21+/+
cells than in HCT116 p21-/- cells (Fig. 3E), supporting
the 8N peak from the FACS analyses (Fig. 2A and B). The
varied mitotic phenotypes could be ascribed to different
working mechanisms of BI inhibitors and Poloxin. It could
be also explained by varied remaining Plk1 activity after
treatment with BI compounds or Poloxin, as described for
selective inhibition of Plk1 by using chemical genetics
[23]. In addition, differing from BI 2536, BI 6727 resulted
in a substantial portion of multipolar cells, as previously
reported [21,24]. We speculate that BI 6727 interferes with
possibly not only Plk1 but also other kinases responsible
for cytokinesis and centrosome duplication in treated cells.

Mitotic arrest is more prominent in HCT116 p21/- cells than in HCT116 p21+/+ cells
To study the cell cycle distribution, both cell lines
were treated with 25 µM Poloxin, 25 nM BI 2536 or 25 nM
BI 6727 for 24 h and harvested for FACS measurements.
Relative to HCT116 p21+/+ cells (Fig. 2A, left panel and
Fig. 2B, upper panel), HCT116 p21‑/- cells showed a
more prominent G2/M arrest upon Poloxin and BI 6727
treatment (Fig. 2A, right panel and Fig. 2B, lower panel).
By contrast, the G2/M peak was comparable in both cell
lines upon BI 2536 treatment (Fig. 2A and B). In addition,
as we recently observed [21], the treatment with BI 6727
produced an 8N peak, which was considerably higher in
HCT116 cells with p21 than in cells deficient in p21 (Fig.
2A and B). Upon 24 h treatment with Plk1 inhibitors, the
signals of the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 (Ser10)
were more intense in cells without p21 than in cells with it
(Fig. 2C, 1st panel), suggesting that Plk1 inhibition triggers
more mitotic hindrance in cells lacking p21. To examine
the specificity of Plk1 inhibition, we further treated cells
with a mixture of two different siRNAs against Plk1 for
24 h and performed FACS analysis. It was apparent that

Poloxin induces strong apoptosis in cells deficient
in p21
For further studies Poloxin was chosen, as it
induced the strongest proliferation difference between
HCT116 p21+/+ and HCT116 p21-/- (Fig. 1A). To
analyze the effect of the specific PBD inhibitor Poloxin,
cells were subjected to various concentrations for 24 h
and harvested for Western blot analysis. Compared to
HCT116 cells with functional p21, HCT116 p21-/- cells

showed a stronger induction of apoptosis demonstrated
by enhanced cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) upon treatment with Poloxin (Fig. 4A, 1st panel),
accompanied by a pronounced mitotic arrest evidenced by
increased phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) (Fig. 4A, 4th panel).
As illustrated in Fig. 4B, the densitometric quantification
of the cleaved PARP signals, based on three independent
experiments, clearly displayed a stronger apoptosis
induction in HCT116 p21-/- cells. The results were further
underscored by measurements of early apoptotic cells
(Fig. 4C, Ann+) as well as late apoptotic cells (Fig. 4D,
Ann+PI+) via FACS and by evaluation of caspase-3/7
activity (Fig. 4E). Moreover, compared to HCT116 p21+/+
cells, an earlier and more intense apoptosis induction was
underlined by Poloxin time kinetics showing an increased
cleaved caspase‑3 in HCT116 p21-/- cells (Fig. 4F, 3rd
panel). Again, a prominent mitotic arrest was demonstrated
by enhanced phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) in HCT116 p21/- cells (Fig. 4F, 5th panel). To be sure that the caspasedependent apoptosis pathway was mainly responsible for
the cell death, cells were incubated with the pan-caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD prior to Plk1 inhibitor treatment. The
incubation with Z-VAD abolished the cleavage of PARP
as well as caspase-3 in cells treated with Poloxin (Fig.
4G, 1st and 2nd panel), and both cleavage products were
again more prominent in HCT116 p21-/- cells treated with
Poloxin without Z-VAD (Fig. 4G, lane 4). Thus, cell death
upon Plk1 inhibition depends mostly on the activation of
caspases, leading to apoptosis induction. In addition, Plk1
depletion with a mixture of two different siRNAs induced
stronger apoptosis in p21-deficient cells than in p21 wild
type cells (Fig. 4H-I). The results suggest that HCT116
cells are more susceptible to Plk1 inhibition in the absence
of p21 by triggering apoptosis.

and in cleaved PARP compared to control cells (Fig. 5H,
1st panel and ratio). Collectively, the data imply that the
presence of functional p21 facilitates the survival of Plk1
inhibited cells by conferring resistance to mitotic arrest
and apoptosis induction.

Cells without p21 show more DNA damage upon
Plk1 inhibition
Next we were wondered why cells with functional
p21 were more capable of surviving the Plk1 inhibitor
treatment. It has been reported that p21 is required for
DNA repair and cells lacking p21 are more sensitive to
DNA damage [25]. We hypothesized that the presence
of p21 could impact the DNA damage response as well
as repair contributing to the outcome of Plk1 inhibitor
treatment. To test this, HCT116 p21+/+ and HCT116 p21/- cells were irradiated, stained for DNA damage markers
p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and γ-H2AX (Ser139), and
the foci were evaluated at indicated time points. Indeed,
untreated HCT116 p21-/- cells, compared to untreated
HCT116 p21+/+ cells, had more foci indicative of double
DNA strand breaks (Fig. 6A and B). 4 h after irradiation,
regardless of the p21 status, the cells displayed higher
numbers of 53BP1/γ-H2AX foci, which were almost
disappeared in HCT116 p21+/+ cells 24 h after irradiation
yet only slightly reduced in HCT116 p21-/- cells (Fig.
6A and B), suggesting that cells have indeed a defective
DNA repair system in the absence of p21. Given that the
balance between p21 expression and DNA damage is
proposed to be crucial for DNA repair or apoptosis [4],
we were then interested if the Poloxin treatment induced
DNA damage and if it was affected by the p21 status in
cells. To address this issue, HCT116 cells were treated
with different Poloxin concentrations for 24 h and stained
for γ-H2AX, the most sensitive and selective biomarker
for DNA damage [26]. This kind of DNA damage has
been known to precede caspase-3 activation and apoptosis
in HeLa cells treated with siRNA against Plk1 [27].
Indeed, compared to cells with p21, HCT116 p21‑/- cells
displayed a stronger staining of γ-H2AX (Fig. 6C), further
supported by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6D, 2nd panel).
Moreover, treatment with BI 2536 and BI 6727 showed
also a remarkable increase in the γ-H2AX signals of cells
deficient in p21 (Fig. 6E, 2nd panel). Collectively, Plk1
inhibitors cause DNA damage indicated by the γ-H2AX
staining, which cannot be repaired in HCT116 cells
without p21 leading further to apoptosis.

More apoptosis upon Poloxin treatment is also
observed in U2OS and MDA-MB-231 cells
depleted of p21
To corroborate the data obtained by the usage of
HCT116 cells, the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS was
depleted of p21 and treated with Poloxin for 24 h (Fig.
5A). Relative to cells treated with control siRNA, 50 µM
Poloxin triggered a stronger G2/M peak in U2OS cells
depleted of p21 with siRNA #1 (Fig. 5B). Moreover, more
apoptosis was induced by Poloxin treatment in U2OS cells
treated with two different siRNAs against p21 (Fig. 5C),
which was further supported by a stronger cleaved PARP
signal in cells treated with siRNA #1 (Fig. 5D, 1st panel
and ratio) and an increased caspase-3/7 activity in cells
treated with siRNA #2 (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, similar
results were also obtained in the metastatic breast cancer
cell line MDA‑MB‑231 depleted of endogenous p21
with siRNA #2 and treated with Poloxin for 24 h, which
displayed an increase in caspase‑3/7 activities (Fig. 5G)

treated with Poloxin and total RNA was isolated for
mRNA evaluation using TaqMan®. The expression of p21
was increased upon Poloxin treatment in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 7A). Western blot analysis revealed that
the protein level of p21 was also enhanced in HCT116
p21+/+ cells after Plk1 inhibition (Fig. 7B, 4th panel).
Intriguingly, the activating phosphorylation of Erk1/2
(extracellular-signal regulating kinase) at Thr202/Tyr204
was more prominent upon Poloxin treatment (Fig. 7B, 1st
and 2nd panel). The increase of p21 induced by Poloxin
in HCT116 cells (Fig. 7C, 1st panel, lane 2) could be
partially rescued by using PD98059, a selective inhibitor
of the MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase cascade,
proved by the abolished activating phosphorylation of

Erk1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204 (Fig. 7C, 2nd panel, lane 3).
Western blot analysis with cytoplasmic and nuclear
fractionized extracts revealed less p21 in the cytoplasm
after treatment with PD98059 (Fig. 7D, 1st panel, lane 3).
The amount of p21 in the cytoplasm was also influenced
by another kinase Akt/PKB (protein kinase B). Therefore,
cells treated with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K
(phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase) of the Akt pathway,
confirmed by the abolished phospho-Akt (Ser473) signal
(Fig. 7E, 2nd panel, lane 3), demonstrated less p21 in the
cytoplasm (Fig. 7E, 1st panel, lane 3). Thus, the results
indicate that p21 is increased and probably stabilized in
the cytoplasm upon Plk1 inhibition, which is regulated by
the MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways as well.

Long-term treatment with Plk1 inhibitors induces
senescence in HCT116 p21+/+ cells, whereas cells
without p21 undergo apoptosis

BI 2536 and BI 6727 generated 4.6 and 4.8 fold more
senescent cells in HCT116 p21+/+ cells, respectively,
compared to HCT116 p21-/- cells (Fig. 8C). In addition,
the proliferation markers Plk1 and cyclin B1 were hardly
detectable by Western blot analysis in HCT116 p21+/+
cells after the long-term inhibition (Fig. 8D, 1st and
2nd panel, lanes 3 to 5), suggestive of cells being nonproliferative but senescent. Proliferation markers were
unobservable in HCT116 p21-/- cells treated with Poloxin,
due to massive apoptosis induction indicated by reduced
GAPDH (Fig. 8D, lane 8).

We wondered then the role of p21 in the longterm Plk1 inhibition. Cells were treated for four days
with various Plk1 inhibitors for evaluation (Fig. 8A).
In cells with p21, BI 6727 generated mostly enlarged
multinucleated or multilobulated cells (Fig. 8B, upper
panel, Fig. S1 and S2), whereas Poloxin caused massive
cell death in the absence of p21 (Fig. 8B, lower panel,
and Fig. S1). Strikingly, cells with functional p21
underwent substantially more senescence after the longterm treatment with various Plk1 inhibitors (Fig. 8B),
demonstrated by using a SA-β-gal (senescence-associated
β-galactosidase) assay, a well-established assay for the
detection of senescent cells [28], in combination with
the co-staining of the proliferation marker Ki-67 to avoid
pseudo-positivity (Fig. 8B). Further analysis revealed that

DISCUSSION
In the present work, we show that p21 impacts the
efficacy of Plk1 inhibition in tumor cells. Compared to
HCT116 p21+/+ cells, HCT116 cells without p21 are
more vulnerable to Plk1 inhibition by showing a stronger
induction of mitotic arrest (Fig. 2), DNA damage (Fig. 6),
apoptosis (Fig. 4) and inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 1).

These results were further corroborated by using different
human cancer cell lines depleted of p21 (Fig. 5), indicative
of p21 being a general protector against Plk1 inhibition.
Furthermore, in the presence of p21, long-term treatment
of Plk1 inhibitors resulted in more senescence in HCT116
cells (Fig. 8A to D). Our data suggest that the Cdkinteracting protein p21 is a useful biomarker for predicting

the efficacy of Plk1 inhibition in tumor cells.
For an effective anticancer therapy, it is desirable
to ensure that the damage induced by small molecule
compounds like Plk1 inhibitors is strong enough to
drive tumor cells undergoing apoptosis otherwise a drug
resistance phenotype will be provoked. In this regard, it
is unfortunately known that p21 favors the activation of

the anti-apoptotic pathways and the implementation of
senescence, whereas the lack of p21 facilitates apoptosis
[29-31], supporting the role of p21 as a threshold
modulator of apoptosis as proposed [4,32-34]. Obviously,
the presence of p21 protects tumor cells from severe
damage upon Plk1 inhibition. Consequently, non-severe
DNA damage induces the expression of p21, which
causes a cell cycle arrest [35,36] and favors an efficient
DNA repair [25,37,38], resulting in a resumed cell cycle.
By contrast, the inactivation of p21 is important for
switching from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis [32,39]. In
line with these notions, our data indicate that the presence
of functional p21 facilitates the survival of tumor cells
upon Plk1 inhibitor treatment by conferring resistance
to mitotic arrest and protection against apoptosis. Since
p21 is required for DNA damage repair [25,37,38] and
Plk1 is necessary for the recovery of DNA damage [40],
Plk1 inhibition in p21-deficient cells could therefore
synergize the cytotoxicity of Plk1 inhibitors and strength
the induction of apoptosis, which is possibly dependent on
p53, as functional p53 is required for a strong induction of
apoptosis [21].
Furthermore, we demonstrate that Plk1 inhibition
induces mitotic stress by defective spindle formation (Fig.
3), which increases the mRNA and protein level of p21 in
a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7A and B). Interestingly,
the increased p21 is localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7D
and E), associated with the activation of the MAPK/Erk
and PI3K/Akt pathways (Fig. 7B to E). It is well known
that p21 can act as a tumor suppressor as well as an
oncogene, the later correlates tightly with its cytoplasmic
localization [1], frequently observed in human tumors
[41]. Cytoplasmic p21 causes the suppression of apoptosis
induced by DNA damage [29,42]. Its anti-apoptotic
properties are mediated through the inhibition of various
caspases and apoptotic effectors [41]. Importantly,
p21 phosphorylations by Erk2 or Akt/PKB result in its
cytoplasmic translocation and stabilization [1]. We show
here that Plk1 inhibition activates the MAPK/Erk and
PI3K/Akt pathways (Fig. 7B to E), likely responsible for
increased p21 in the cytoplasm of HCT116 cells (Fig.
7D and E), leading further to the inhibition of apoptosis
and survival of treated tumor cells. The importance of
our results is underscored by other studies showing that
increased cytoplasmic p21 due to Akt phosphorylation
contributes to cancer progression, therapy resistance
and poor prognosis [34,43-46]. In fact, a recent study
has highlighted the significance of cytoplasmic p21 in
vivo demonstrating an accelerated tumor onset and lung
metastasis by generating transgenic mice expressing
its Akt-phosphorylated active form (p21T145D) in the
mammary epithelium [47].
Plk1 inhibitors are currently undergoing various
clinical trials [48], it is thus important to study its response
in tumor cells after a long-term treatment. Interestingly,
a distinctive induction of senescence in p21 wild type
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells was observed upon four days treatment, especially
with BI 2536 or BI 6727, characteristic of being flattened,
enlarged, multinucleated, SA-β-gal-positive and Ki‑67negative (Fig. 8 A to D, Fig. S1 and S2), whereas a strong
apoptosis was induced in cells lacking p21 (Fig. 8A to D,
Fig. S1). These results are supported by a previous study
showing that p21 was responsible for senescence induction
in cells treated with low concentrations of camptothecin
whereas HCT116 cells without p21 underwent apoptosis
[31]. Our data are further underlined by developmental
studies, in which apoptosis but not senescence was
observed in cells without p21 [49,50]. Importantly, it has
been reported that partial inhibition of the activity of Plk1
by using chemical genetics or its depletion with siRNA
induces cellular senescence [23,51]. Together these data
indicate that Plk1 inhibition in p21-deficient cells favors
the induction of senescence. Given the supportive role of
senescent cells for tumor cell development, via a profound
secretory phenotype with pro-inflammatory characteristics
[52] contributing to therapy resistance [53], it should
be kept in mind that tumor cells which survived Plk1
inhibitor treatment could contribute to a more aggressive
cancer development.
In summary, p21 is crucial to determine the fate
of tumor cells treated with Plk1 inhibitors, in particular
Poloxin (Fig. 8E). In the presence of p21, Plk1 inhibition,
along with an induction of mitotic arrest, enhances
strikingly the expression of p21 and activates MAPK/Erk
and PI3K/Akt pathways, which likely stabilizes p21 in the
cytoplasm of treated tumor cells. Increased cytoplasmic
p21 facilitates DNA damage repair, confers resistance to
apoptosis and favors senescence induction in tumor cells,
leading to cell survival and a limited therapy success
accompanied by a small fraction of cells undergoing
apoptosis (Fig. 8E). In contrast, cells without p21
displayed a pronounced mitotic arrest, irreversible DNA
damage, the activation of apoptosis favorable MAPK/Erk
pathway [54] and intense apoptosis induction (Fig. 8E),
strongly indicative of a high efficacy of Plk1 inhibitors in
p21-deficient tumor cells.

METHODS

Aldrich (Taufkirchen), PD98059 from Merck Millipore
(Darmstadt) and wortmannin from Cell Signaling (Beverly,
USA). siRNA (20 nM) transient transfections were
performed as previously described [7]. Regarding Plk1
depletion, two different siRNAs (each 10 nM) were mixed
to avoid off-target effects. siRNAs targeting p21 (sense:
ACACCUCCUCAUGUACAUAUU and antisense:
AAUAUGUACAUGAGGAGGUGU; designated as sip21
#2) or Plk1 (sense 1: GAUCACCCUCCUUAAAUAU

AAUACUGUAUUCAUUCUUC) were manufactured by
Sigma-Aldrich. A different siRNA against p21 (referred
to as sip21 #1), containing a pool of siRNAs, was from
Santa Cruz (Heidelberg). Control siRNA was obtained
from Qiagen (Hilden). For irradiation, cells were exposed
to a single dose of 2.0 Gy at room temperature by a linear
accelerator (SL 75/5, Elekta, Crawley, UK) with 6 MEV
photons/100 cm focus-surface distance and a dose rate of
4.0 Gy/min.

15 min with 4% PFA and permeabilized for 5 min with

rabbit antibodies against pericentrin (abcam®) and 53BP1
(Novus, Cambridge, UK), monoclonal mouse antibodies
against FITC-conjugated α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), antiphospho-histone γ-H2AX (Ser139) and human immune
serum against centromere (anti-centromere antibody,
ACA, ImmunoVision, Springdale, USA). FITC, Cy3
and Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained
from Jackson Immunoresearch (Newmarket, UK). DNA
was stained using DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoledihydrochloride, Roche). Slides were examined using
an AxioObserver.Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen) and

assays

Cellular extract preparation, Western blot
analysis and indirect immunofluorescence

Cell proliferation assays were carried out by using
Cell Titer-Blue® Cell Viability Assay on treated cells in
96-well plates (Promega, Mannheim). 20 µl of CellTiterBlue® reagent was added to each well and then incubated
at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 h before fluorescence reading
using a Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter (Wallac, Finland).
Cell cycle was analyzed using a FACSCaliburTM (BD
Biosciences), as described [55]. Briefly, cells were
harvested, washed with PBS, fixed in chilled 70% ethanol
at 4°C for 30 min, treated with 1 mg/ml of RNase A
(Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with 100 μg/ml of propidium
iodide (PI) for 30 min at 37°C. DNA content was
determined. Early apoptosis (Ann+) and late apoptosis
(Ann+PI+) were assessed using Vybrant™ apoptosis assay
kit #2 according to the instructions (Molecular Probes,
Leiden). Apoptosis was measured with a FACSCaliburTM
(BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed by using the
cell cycle analysis software CellQuest (BD Biosciences).
The activity of caspase‑3/7 was measured in triplicate with
Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay as instructed (Promega).

Cell lysis was performed using RIPA buffer (50
mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Nadesoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT,
phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche,
Mannheim)). Western blot analysis was performed as
previously described [55]. Cytoplasmic and nuclear
fractionation was performed as instructed (Active Motif,
La Hulpe, Belgium). Briefly, cells were harvested in icecold PBS with phosphatase inhibitors and resuspended
in hypotonic buffer to swell the cell membranes. The
cytoplasmic fractions were collected after adding
detergent. The remaining pellet, the nuclei, was solubilized
in a low-salt digestion buffer completed with protease
inhibitor and PMSF followed by DNA digestion. Mouse
monoclonal antibody against calnexin was from BD
Biosciences (Heidelberg) and against lamin B1 from MBL
(Woburn, USA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against
cyclin B1 and Plk1 were obtained from Santa Cruz.
Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against caspase‑3, phosphoErk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and p21, rabbit polyclonal
antibodies against Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473) and PARP

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)
assay was performed at pH 5.9 as instructed [28]. Briefly,
HCT116 p21+/+ and HCT116 p21-/- cells were seeded in
chamber slides (NuncTM Lab-TekTM II CC2TM), treated for
96 h and stained with X-gal staining solution overnight at
37°C without CO2. The next day, cells were washed, fixed
(5 min 4% PFA and 5 min with 0.2% TritonTM X-100)
and stained for immunohistochemical analysis with the
monoclonal mouse anti-human Ki-67 antigen (Clone
MIB-1, DAKO, Hamburg) by using the ImmunoCruzTM
mouse ABC staining system from Santa Cruz. The
antibody complexes were visualized through exposure to
3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate (DAKO), as
previously described [56]. The cells were observed with
an AxioObserver.Z1 microscope (Zeiss), imaged with an
AxioCam MRc camera (Zeiss) and the β-galactosidase
positive cells were evaluated.
