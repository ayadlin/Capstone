ABSTRACT
Emerging evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNA) play a critical
role in chemotherapy-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast
cancer. However, the underlying mechanism of chemotherapy-mediated EMT has
not been fully understood. To address this concern, we explored the role of miR-125b
in regulation of EMT in stable paclitaxel-resistant (PR) breast cancer cells, namely
MCF-7 PR and SKBR3 PR, which have displayed mesenchymal features. Our results
illustrated that miR-125b was significantly downregulated in PR cells. Moreover,
ectopic expression of miR-125b by its mimics reversed the phenotype of EMT in PR
cells. Furthermore, we found that miR-125b governed PR-mediate EMT partly due
to governing its target Sema4C. More importantly, overexpression of miR-125b or
depletion of Sema4C sensitized PR cells to paclitaxel. These findings suggest that
up-regulation of miR-125b or targeting Sema4C could serve as novel approaches to
reverse chemotherapy resistance in breast cancers.

INTRODUCTION

resistance, and find a novel strategy for enabling better
therapeutic benefits of breast cancer patients.
Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the
drug-resistant (DR) cells are associated with epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in human cancers. It
is known that EMT is a complex biological process in
which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal properties.
Specifically, cells have decreased expression of the
epithelial adhesion marker E-cadherin and gain the
increased expression of mesenchymal molecules
including Snail, Slug, Vimentin, zinc-finger E-box binding
homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and ZEB2, leading to enhanced
motility, invasion and metastasis as well as drug resistance
[6]. In line with this concept, multiple studies have
revealed that chemotherapeutic drug can induce EMT,
resulting in drug resistance [7-9]. For example, paclitaxel

Breast cancer is one of the most common women
tumors, which leads to high mortality in the United States
[1]. According to the American Cancer Society, 23,270
new breast cancer cases and approximately 40,000 deaths
due to this deadly disease are projected to occur in 2014
[2]. It has been documented that chemotherapy is one of
the standard therapeutic approaches for the treatment of
breast cancer, which has shown to inhibit tumor growth
and prolong patient survival [3]. However, some breast
cancer patients are resistant to chemotherapy mainly
due to intrinsic or acquired resistance, which could
lead to failure of chemotherapy and worse treatment
outcome [4, 5]. Thus, it is urgent to gain further insight
into the molecular mechanism of chemotherapeutic drug

(also known as taxol) resistant (PR)-epithelial ovarian
carcinoma cells displayed EMT features, which could
be due to upregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) [10, 11]. Emerging evidence suggests that elevated
chemokine CCL2 (C-C motif ligand 2) was found in PR
ovarian cancer cell lines [12]. Moreover, overexpression of
several molecules such as human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), lung resistancerelated protein (LRP), glutathione-S-transferase-π (GST-π)
was observed in PR breast cancer cells [13]. Our previous
study has shown that acquisition of EMT is associated
with overexpression of S-phase kinase-associated protein
2 (Skp2) in PR breast cancer cells [14]. Although these
studies dissect the PR mechanism, further investigation
is required to elucidate the exact molecular basis of PRinduced EMT.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that microRNAs
(miRNAs) play a key role in regulation of drug resistance
and DR-induced EMT. It is known that miRNAs, a class
of small non-coding RNAs of about 19-25 nucleotides in
length, negatively regulate gene expression by repressing
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or cleaving mRNAs. It is
clear that miRNAs can exert its oncogenic or anti-tumor
activities depending on the cellular function of their
targets. Fang et al. reported that miR-17-5p promoted
chemotherapeutic drug resistance and tumor metastasis
through repressing PTEN (phosphatase and tensin
homolog deleted on chromosome ten) expression in
colorectal cancer [15]. Additionally, miR-25 was found
to regulate chemoresistance-associated autophagy in
breast cancer cells [16]. Notably, miRNAs were reported
to regulate DR-mediated EMT in human breast cancer.
For instance, Jiang et al. found that miR-489 governed
chemoresistance through regulating Smad3 expression and
Smad3 related EMT in breast cancer [17]. Moreover, reexpression of miR-375 sensitized tamoxifen-resistant cells
to tamoxifen and partly reversed EMT due to regulation
of metadherin in breast cancer [18]. Furthermore,
overexpression of miR-200c inhibited the resistance
of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin via suppressing
E-cadherin-mediated PTEN /Akt signaling pathway
[19]. Consistently, restoration of miR-200c increased
trastuzumab sensitivity and inhibited invasiveness of
breast cancer cells through regulating EMT and targeting
ZEB1 and zinc finger gene 217 (ZNF217) [20]. In support
of the role of miR-200 family in drug resistance, it has
been reported that reduced miR-200b and miR-200c
expression contributed to endocrine resistance in breast
cancer cells [21]. These reports unraveled the crucial roles
of miRNAs in drug resistance-mediated EMT; however,
whether miR-125b has a potential role in PR-induced
EMT remains largely unknown.
In the present study, we explored the role of miR125b in controlling PR-mediated EMT in breast cancer
cells. We further determine whether Sema4C, one of
miR-125b targets, was involved in PR-induced EMT.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We identified that miR-125b was down-regulated in
PR cells and overexpression of miR-125b reversed the
mesenchymal features in breast cancer cells. Notably,
ectopic expression of miR-125b or depletion of its target
Sema4C sensitized PR cells to paclitaxel. Our results
revealed that re-expression of miR-125b or inhibition of
Sema4C could be potential therapeutic approaches for
treating PR breast cancer.

RESULTS
Downregulation of miR-125b is observed in PR
cells
It has been demonstrated that miR-125b is critically
involved in regulating EMT in human cancer [22]. To
determine whether miR-125b plays a pivotal role in
PR-induced EMT in breast cancer cells, we measured
the expression of miR-125b in PR cells and their
parental cells. Our results revealed that miR-125b was
significantly downregulated in PR cells (Figure 1A). This
finding indicated that downregulation of miR-125b could
contribute to PR-induced EMT.

Overexpression of miR-125b inhibits cell motility
and invasion in PR cells
To further validate the role of miR-125b in
regulating EMT, we determined the cell migration and
invasion in PR cells after miR-125 mimic treatment by
wound healing assay and invasion assay, respectively.
Our wound healing assay showed that miR-125b mimic
inhibited the cell migration in both MCF-7 PR and SKBR3
PR cells (Figure 1B). In line with this result, we found that
miR-125b mimic suppressed the cell invasion in PR cells
(Figure 1C, 1D). Our results suggest that miR-125b could
play a critical role in governing PR-mediate EMT.

Overexpression of miR-125b reverses EMT in PR
Cells
Our previous study has shown that PR cells have
mesenchymal features [14]. To further explore whether
ectopic expression of miR-125b could reverse the
mesenchymal characteristics in PR cells, we transfected
miR-125b mimic into MCF-7 PR and SKBR3 PR cells.
We observed that miR-125b mimic treatment led to
reversal of EMT in PR cells, which have changed from
elongated, fibroblastoid morphology to a rounded shape
(Figure 2A). Consistently, miR-125b mimic treatment
reduced the capacity of detachment and attachment in
PR cells (Figure 2B, 2C). In support of this notion, we
measured the expression of EMT markers in PR cells

Western blotting analysis. We found that miR-125b mimic
transfection caused the higher expression of E-cadherin
and lower expression of mesenchymal markers such as
Snail, Slug and Vimentin at both mRNA (Figure 3A, 3B)
and protein levels (Figure 3C, 3D) in PR cells. Our results
revealed that reduction of miR-125b could be responsible
for PR-induced EMT in breast cancer cells.

confirm this concept, we measured the expression of
Sema4C at mRNA and protein levels by real-time RT-PCR
and Western blotting analysis, respectively. We found that
miR-125b overexpression decreased Sema4C expression
at both mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7 PR and
SKBR3 PR cells (Figure 4A). To further validate whether
Sema4C is a direct and specific target of miR-125b, miR125b mimic and Sema4C 3’-UTR wild type or 3’-UTR
mutated luciferase reporter were transfected into MCF-7
PR and SKBR3 PR cells. We found that miR-125b mimic
decreased Sema4C 3’-UTR wild-type, but not Sema4C 3’UTR mutation in which the binding sites for miR-125b
were mutated, reporter activity (Figure 4B). Moreover,
we observed that miR-125b inhibitor increased Sema4C
3’-UTR wild-type, but not Sema4C mutation, in MCF7 and SKBR3 cells (Figure 4B). Taken together, these
findings suggest that miR-125b specifically targets the 3’UTR of Sema4C and subsequently inhibits its expression.
Consistently, we found the high expression of Sema4C
in MCF-7 PR and SKBR3 PR cells compared with their
parental cells (Figure 4C, 4D).

MiR-125b regulates EMT by targeting Sema4C
in PR cells
It has been well known that miRNA exerts its
function via binding to the 3’-UTR (untranslated region)
of target genes through partial sequence homology.
Therefore, to further investigate the role of miR-125b
in controlling PR-mediated EMT, we used two target
prediction programs, TargetScan and miRanda, to screen
the potential targets of miR-125b. Our analysis predicted
that Sema4C could be a potential miR-125b target. To

To further determine whether Sema4C is involved
in PR-mediated EMT, we measured the cell motility

Sema4C siRNA. We found that both Sema4C siRNA1
and its siRNA2 transfection markedly inhibited Sema4C
expression in MCF-7 PR and SKBR3 PR cells (Figure

Sema4C RNA level was also significantly downregulated
by Sema4C siRNA treatment (Figure 5B). Moreover, our
wound healing assay showed that depletion of Sema4C
retarded cell motility in PR cells (Figure 5C). Consistent
with this result, Sema4C siRNA transfection inhibited the

showed that depletion of Sema4C increased the E-cadherin
mRNA and protein levels, but decreased the expression of
mesenchymal markers including Snail, Slug, and Vimentin
(Figure 6A-6D). Taken together, these results indicated
that Sema4C plays a critical role in regulating PR-induced
EMT in breast cancer cells.

upregulation of Mucin1, whereas upregulation of miR125b enhanced the apoptosis response of breast cancer
cells to cisplatin treatment [32]. Zhang et al. reported
that miR-125b is methylated and functions as a tumor
suppressor through targeting the ETS1 proto-oncogene
in human invasive breast cancer [33]. In light of these
findings, one study showed that overexpression of miR125b retarded motility and migration behaviors via
targeting ARID3B (T-rich interactive domain 3B) in breast
cancer cells [34]. Recently, miR-125b was validated to
target erythropoietin and its receptor and their expression
is associated with metastatic potential in breast cancer
[28]. In consistent with these reports, miR-125b was
found to exert its anti-tumor activity via regulating ENPEP
(aminopeptidase A), CK2-α (casein kinase 2 alpha), CCNJ
(cyclin J) and MEGF9 (multiple EGF-like-domains 9)
in breast cancer [29]. Furthermore, the decreased miR125b levels in breast cancer tissues led to high expression
of its target CYP24 (Vitamin D3 hydroxylase), which
could cause tumorigenesis [35]. However, Fang et al.
found that miR-125b could induce metastasis through
targeting STARD13 (StAR-related lipid transfer domain
containing 13) in breast cancer cells [36], suggesting that
further investigation is necessary to explore the function
of miR-125b in tumor metastasis. In the current study,
we observed that overexpression of miR-125b inhibited
cell migration and invasion through targeting Sema4C in
breast cancer cells.
Several studies have demonstrated that Sema4C,

To determine whether up-regulation of miR-125b
or depletion of Sema4C enhances PR cells to paclitaxel
sensitivity, we conducted SRB assay in PR cells treated
with miR-125b mimic or Sema4C siRNA. We found
that overexpression of miR-125b or downregulation of
Sema4C significantly promoted cell growth inhibition
induced by 10µg/ml paclitaxel in MCF-7 PR and SKBR3
PR cells (Figure 7A). These findings demonstrated that PR
cells with miR-125b mimic or Sema4C siRNA treatment
were significantly more sensitive to paclitaxel-induced cell
growth inhibition.

DISCUSSION
Dysregulation of miR-125b has been identified to
play an important role in the initiation and progression
of human malignancies including breast cancer [23]. For
instance, miR-125b was downregulated in breast cancer
primary tumors compared with normal breast samples
[24-30]. Moreover, overexpression of miR-125b inhibited
cell growth and reduced migration and invasion in breast
cancer cells through suppression of ERBB2 (erythroblastic
leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) and ERBB3 in
breast cancer cells [31]. Additionally, downregulation of
miR-125b increased breast cancer cell growth through

a member of the semaphorin family, plays a crucial role
in regulating EMT. For example, Sema4C induced EMT
through suppression of E-cadherin and induction of
Vimentin in HK2 cells [37]. In line with this, knockdown
of Sema4C reversed TGF-β1 (transforming growth
factor, beta 1)-mediated EMT through suppressing
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein
kinase), whereas upregulation of Sema4C promoted EMT
via activation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in human
proximal tubular epithelial cells [38]. Moreover, high
expression of Sema4C has been observed in esophageal
cancer, gastric cancer and rectal cancer and is correlated
with lymphatic metastasis [39]. In support of the role of
Sema4C in controlling EMT, our results showed that it has
high expression of Sema4C in EMT-type PR cells. More
importantly, depletion of Sema4C regulated expression of
EMT markers and inhibited motility and invasion in PR
cells. Notably, we identified Sema4C as a target of miR125b, indicating that miR-125b exerts its function partly
due to governing Sema4C expression.
Accumulating evidence has suggested that miR125b was critically involved in drug resistance. It has
been reported that overexpression of miR-125b sensitized
cells to 5-fluorouracil by regulation of hexokinase II
and inhibition of glycolysis in human hepatocellular
carcinoma cells [40]. Moreover, miR-125b was reported to
promote leukemia cell resistance to daunorubicin through
inhibiting expression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase
2 and apoptosis [41]. Interestingly, studies have identified
that inhibition of miR-125b enhanced the chemosensitivity
of glioblastoma stem cells to temozolomide through
regulating Bak1 (Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1) and PIAS3
(protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and
activator of transcription) [42-44]. In addition, it has been
shown that miR-125b was overexpression in vincristineresistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia [45]. Consistently,
studies have revealed that overexpression of miR-125b
increased drug resistance in pediatric acute promyelocytic
leukemia [46], Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal
tumor [47], and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas [48]. To
further determine the role of miR-125b in drug resistance
in breast cancer, we measured the expression of miR-125b
in PR cells and observed down-regulation of miR-125b in
PR cells. Remarkably, we found that overexpression of
miR-125b sensitized PR cells to paclitaxel in breast cancer
cells. Surprisingly, one study showed that miR-125b was
downregulated in PR ovarian cancer cells, but upregulated
in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells [49], suggesting
that miR-125b could play an opposite role in different
drug resistant cell lines. However, it has been considered
that miR-125b upregulation dictates its oncogenic
characteristics, while miR-125b downregulation leads
to the loss of tumor suppressor functions [23]. Without
a doubt, in-depth investigation is required to explore the
function of miR-125b in different tumor entities.
Due to the important role of miR-125b involved in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drug resistance and EMT, targeting miR-125b could be a
novel strategy for treating human cancers (Figure 7B). To
this end, several groups have discovered multiple agents
that regulated the miR-125b expression. We have found
that arsenic trioxide could regulate the expression of miR125b in human glioma [50]. A short hairpin-looped DNA
analogous oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) to miR-125b
has been shown to inhibit C-Raf (C-rapidly accelerated
fibrosarcoma) expression, proliferation, and survival of
breast cancer cells [51]. Wang et al. found that the class I
HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor entinostat induced
miR-125b expression and subsequently downregulated
ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression, leading to cell apoptosis
in breast cancer cells [52]. However, it is pivotal to
develop the specific miR-125b inhibitor or activator for
the treatment of human cancer. Taken together, activation
of miR-125b or inactivation of Sema4C may be a useful
strategy to reverse chemotherapy resistance in breast
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MCF-7 PR,
SKBR3 and SKBR3 PR were cultured in RPMI 1600
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), and maintained in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator at 37°C. MCF-7 PR and SKBR3 PR cells
displayed resistance to cell growth inhibition of 10µg/
ml paclitaxel [14]. The resistant cells were maintained in
culture medium with 10µg/ml paclitaxel.

Reagents and antibodies
Tumor Invasion Assay Kit was bought from BD
Biosciences (Bedford, MA, USA). Sulforhodamine
B (SRB) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo).
Primary antibodies against Vimentin, Snail, Slug,
E-cadherin, Sema4C, and β-actin were bought from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Cell proliferation assay
The transfected cells (5 ×103) were seeded in each
well of the 96-well plates for overnight incubation. Then,
the cells were treated with 10µg/ml paclitaxel for 72
hours. After the culture medium was removed, 200µl of
10% trichloroacetic acid was added and incubated at 4 °C
for 1 h. The plates were flicked, washed, and stained with
100µl SRB for 30 min at 37 °C. The unbound dye was
removed and air-dried. Then, 150µl of 10 mmol/L Tris was
added to the plates to solubilise the dye. The absorbance

The cells were seeded in 6-well plate until the cells
reached to 90% confluency. The confluent monolayers
were scratched by a 200 µl pipette tip to generate the
wound. The debris and floating cells were removed though
washing with PBS. The cells were cultured for 20 hours
to allow wound healing. The photographic images were
taken at 0 hour and 20 hours.

The miRNA RT-PCR was used to detect the
alterations of miR-125b expression in breast cancer
cells as described previously [50]. Briefly, 10 ng of
total RNA was reversed transcribed into cDNA using
TaqMan miRNA hsa-miR-125b-specific primers (Applied
Biosystems). Then real-time PCR was performed using a
TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems). RNA U6 was carried out as endogenous
control in each sample. The relative expression was
analyzed using the comparative Ct method.

Transwell invasion assays

The invasive activity of cells was measured using
Transwell inserts precoated with Matrigel as described
earlier [53]. Briefly, cells were added to the upper chamber
of the inserts. Cell culture medium with 10% FBS was
added to the lower chamber. The cells were allowed to
invade for 20 hours at 37°C. After removing cells on
the upper side of the transwell, the invading cells on the
underside were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
stained with Giemsa solution. The stained invaded cells
were photographed under a microscope.

Cells were seeded in six-well plates and
transfected with Sema4C siRNA, or control siRNA

Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented
with protease inhibitors. The protein concentrations
were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA). The proteins were resolved
through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. These membranes were immunoblotted with
indicated antibodies, and then with peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody for Western blotting as described
previously [54].

Luciferase reporter assay

2.	

The miR-125b response element (wide type or
mutated) in the 3’-UTR of Sema4C was cloned into pMIRREPORT plasmid downstream of luciferase reporter gene.
Cells seeded into 24-well plates were cotransfected with
miR-125b and luciferase reporter constructs containing
WT or MT Sema4C 3’-UTR. We used a luciferase assay
kit to analyze luciferase activities.

Cell attachment and detachment assay
Cell attachment and detachment assays were
conducted as described previously [55]. Briefly, for
attachment assay, non-attached cells were washed after
the cells were seeded in 24-well plate for one hour.
The attached cells were trypsinized and counted. For
detachment assay, the cells were detached with trypsin
for 3 minutes and counted after they were seeded for
overnight. The attached cells were also counted after
trypsinization. The data were quantified as a percentage of
the attached/detached cells to total cells.
