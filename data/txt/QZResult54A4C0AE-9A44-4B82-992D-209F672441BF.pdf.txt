refs. 3, 4). Phosphorylation of integrins by RTKs and non-RTKs such
as FAK and Src may, in turn, regulate ‘‘inside-out’’ integrin signaling
by altering their affinity and avidity to ECM ligands. The
membrane-proximal clustering of integrin and RTK requires FAK
as the scaffold that interacts with both RTK and integrin receptors
through different domains (3).
HER2 gene amplification or overexpression of HER2 is observed
in f30% of invasive breast cancers, where it correlates with poor
patient prognosis. Several integrin-associated signaling molecules,
including both integrins h1 and h4, integrin-linked kinase, and
FAK, have been implicated in the initiation and progression
of mammary tumors driven by oncogenes such as Neu (the
rat homologue of HER2) and the polyomavirus middle T (PyVMT;
refs. 4–7). In the transgenic mouse model of mouse mammary
tumor virus (MMTV)/Neu, targeted deletion of h4 integrin
was shown to suppress mammary tumor onset and invasive
growth (4).
Transforming growth factor h (TGF-h), a multitasking cytokine
involved in development, differentiation, tissue regeneration, and
immune response, has also been shown to synergize with Neu/
ErbB2 (8–11). Overexpression of active TGF-h1 or active mutants
of the type I TGF-h receptor (Alk5) in the mammary gland of
bitransgenic mice also expressing MMTV/Neu accelerates metastases from Neu-induced mammary cancers (8–10). In the MCF10A
human mammary epithelial cells that were engineered to
overexpress HER2 (MCF10A/HER2), TGF-h induces cell migration
and invasion (12, 13). Inhibition of HER2 with the HER2neutralizing antibody trastuzumab blocked the promigratory
effect of TGF-h on HER2-overexpressing mammary epithelial
cells (12), suggesting that the proto-oncogene is required for the
transforming effect of TGF-h in HER2-overexpressing transformed
cells.
We have previously shown that TGF-h induces HER2 translocalization to the lamellipodia through a phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)–dependent mechanism that involves activation of
Rac1 and Rak1 and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton (13).
Moreover, blockade of integrin signaling by an inhibitory antibody
against h1 integrin abrogates the function of TGF-h to induce
motility in MCF10A/HER2 cells (12). Because TGF-h is known to
influence various integrin functions such as adhesion and migration,
we focused in this study on the role of integrin signaling in the cross
talk between TGF-h and HER2 in breast cancer progression.

Abstract
It has been proposed that cross talk between integrin and
growth factor receptor signaling such as ErbB2 (HER2) is
required for activation of downstream effectors and ErbB2mediated mammary tumorigenesis. Here we show that transforming growth factor B (TGF-B) induced focal adhesion
kinase (FAK)–dependent clustering of HER2 and integrins A6,
B1, and B4 in HER2-overexpressing mammary epithelial cells
without altering the total and surface levels of HER2
receptors. This effect was mediated by ligand-induced
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and the
subsequent phosphorylation of Src and FAK. We have
previously reported that TGF-B up-regulates EGFR ligand
shedding through a mechanism involving the phosphorylation
of tumor necrosis factor-A–converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17). Knockdown of TACE, FAK, or integrin A6 by siRNA or
inhibition of EGFR or Src by specific inhibitors abrogated
TGF-B–induced receptor clustering and signaling to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt. Finally, inhibition of Src-FAK
reversed TGF-B–induced resistance to the therapeutic HER2
inhibitor trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells. Taken together, these data suggest that, by activating
Src-FAK, TGF-B integrates ErbB receptor and integrin signaling to induce cell migration and survival during breast cancer
progression. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):475–82]

Introduction
The integrin family of transmembrane receptors of the
extracellular matrix (ECM) mediates a wide variety of cellular
behaviors including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
survival (1, 2). In addition to transducing signals in the ECM to the
cell membrane and initiating intracellular signaling through
integrin-associated proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK),
integrins are also involved in growth factor signaling through
coclustering with the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2
(ErbB2), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR;

Figure 1. TGF-h induces clustering of HER2 and integrins a6, h1, and h4 at the cell membrane. A, matrix and matrix-associated proteins were prepared from
MCF10A/HER2 cells grown on a 100-mm culture dish as described in ref. 17. The preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE and the identities of the proteins were
determined by peptide mass mapping and single-stage MS as indicated in Materials and Methods. B, MCF10A/HER2 cells grown on culture dishes were treated with
TGF-h (2 ng/mL) or equal amount of PBS (vehicle control) for 24 h in growth medium. At the end of treatment, cells were harvested by trypsinization and stained
with antibodies against integrins a6, a3, h1, and h4, followed by a secondary FITC-conjugated antibody. Stained cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for the
level of FITC. C, MCF10A/HER2 cells were serum starved for 16 h before being treated with TGF-h (2 ng/mL) for 1 or 24 h. At the end of the treatment, cells were lysed
for immunoprecipitation with antibodies against HER2 and integrin a6, h1, or h4. The pull-downs were subjected to immunoblot with the indicated antibodies.
D, MCF10A/HER2, MDA-MB-453, and BT-474 cells were serum starved for 16 h and treated with TGF-h or PBS (vehicle control) for 1 h before being subjected to
matrix preparation or cell-surface biotinylation as described in Materials and Methods. Prepared matrix proteins, the streptavidin pull-down for surface-located proteins,
and the whole cell lysate were subjected to immunoblot with HER2 antibody. Brefeldin A (10 Ag/mL) was added to cells 1 h before TGF-h in the indicated lanes.

Pierce) 30 min at 4jC. The reaction was quenched with 100 mmol/L glycine in
PBS and the cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (20 mmol/L Tris, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors).
After sonication for 10 s and centrifugation (14,000 rpm), protein concentration in the supernatants was measured using the bicinchoninic acid
protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein extracts (500 Ag)
were subjected to precipitation using Streptavidin Magnetic Spheres
(Promega) followed by SDS-PAGE and HER2 immunoblot. For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in NP40 lysis
buffer. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were done as described
(14) using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega). Primary antibodies include integrins a6, a3, h1, and h4 and TACE
(Chemicon); EGFR and HER2/ErbB2 (NeoMarkers); actin (Sigma); FAK and
Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); P-EGFR(Y1068), P-HER2(Y1248),
P-Src(Y416), P-FAK(Y397), P-Akt(S473), and Akt (Cell Signaling); and p85
(Upstate Biotechnology). Bands were quantified using ImageJ.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells were harvested by
trypsinization, washed with PBS, and exposed to monoclonal antibodies of

bovine serum (Hyclone) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37jC.
Recombinant human TGF-h1 and TGF-a were purchased from R&D
Systems. Brefeldin A, protein phosphatase 2 (PP2), and cytochalasin D were
purchased from Sigma. Trastuzumab and cetuximab were purchased at the
Vanderbilt University Medical Center Pharmacy. Lapatinib ditosylate (GW572016) was from LC Laboratories. Adenoviruses encoding dominant
negative p85 (AxDp85) were described previously (15). The plasmid
encoding the hemagglutinin-tagged full-length mouse TACE [TACE(HA)]
was described previously (16).
Matrix preparation and mass spectrometry. Preparation of deposited
ECM and matrix-associated proteins was done as described (17). Briefly,
confluent MCF10A/HER2 cells were lysed on plate by incubating in 20 mmol/L
sterile NH4OH for 5 min at room temperature, followed by gentle scraping
and extensive washing. The remaining matrix preparation was directly
scraped into reducing Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and applied to SDSPAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie blue. Excised protein bands were
subjected to in-gel digestion as described elsewhere (13).

instrument (Becton Dickinson).
Cell viability, motility, and invasion assays. For viability assays, cells
growing on six-well plates were serum starved for 48 h and collected for
trypan blue staining as described elsewhere (18). Trypan blue–positive cells
were counted manually and their percentage was calculated over the total
cell input. Transwell motility assays were done as described previously (19).
Invasion assay was done using laminin- or collagen-coated transwells (BD
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were seeded at
2.5  104 per well on coated transwells and allowed to invade toward
serum-free medium F TGF-h. At 16 h, cells that invaded through the
transwell filters were stained and counted as described (19).
Three-dimensional cell culture. Cells were seeded on growth factor–
reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in eight-well chamber slides following
the protocol described by Debnath and colleagues (20). Inhibitors were
added into the medium 12 h after cell seeding and were replenished every
3 d. Phase-contrast images were taken every 3 d. For cell number counting,
cultures growing on Matrigel were trypsinized and cell numbers were
measured in a Coulter counter.
RNA interference studies. Silencer siRNAs against human TACE were
obtained from Qiagen in a FlexiTube format. Four species of siRNAs against
different TACE target sequences (TCCCATGAAGAACACGTGTAA,
CTGCAGTAAACAATCAATCTA, CAGGATGTAATTGAACGATTT, and
AAGAAACAGAGTGCTAATTTA) were mixed in equal amount to generate
a TACE siRNA pool (siTACE). SiRNAs against FAK target sequences

Results
TGF-B induces clustering of HER2 and integrins A6, B1, and
B4 at the cell membrane. We first determined the ECM deposited
by MCF10A/HER2 cells. Cells growing on tissue culture dishes
were lysed as described in Materials and Methods; proteins
attached to the plate were harvested and subjected to mass
spectrometry (MS). Laminin-5, which consists of the laminin a3,
h3, and g2 chains, as well as integrins a6, a3, h1, and h4, were
identified in the matrix deposited by 10A/HER2 cells by MS
(Fig. 1A). We also analyzed the ECM composition in cells treated
with TGF-h for 24 hours using the same approach and did not
find different protein species between treated and untreated cells.
As determined by flow cytometry using specific antibodies,

quantified using ImageJ, with untreated cell samples (first lanes ) set as 1.0.

clustering (Fig. 2A). Concurrently, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK
(site Y397) and Src (Y416) was also induced by TGF-h. Phosphorylation of the Y397 Src-binding site of FAK is required for p85
binding and PI3K activation (21). In line with this report, activation
of Akt was also detected along with FAK phosphorylation during
the time course following TGF-h treatment (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of
Src kinase activity with PP2 abolished both basal and TGF-h–
induced association of HER2 with FAK and integrin h1 and the
TGF-h–induced activation of FAK and Akt (Fig. 2B). Finally,
knockdown of FAK expression using specific siRNA abolished the
ability of TGF-h to induce receptor clustering and FAK-mediated
activation of Akt and severely impaired both basal and TGFh–induced phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR as detected with
site-specific phospho-antibodies (Fig. 2C). Control immunoprecipitation with anti–integrin a3 was also done in all experiments and
showed negative results (data not shown).
TGF-B induces Src-FAK through EGFR activation. In a recent
study (22), we have reported that TGF-h induces the shedding of
ErbB ligands TGF-a, amphiregulin, and heregulin through a TACEdependent mechanism. To explore whether this is responsible for
the activation of the Src-FAK pathway by TGF-h, we used the EGFR
antibody cetuximab to block ligand binding to EGFR or siRNA to
knock down the expression of TACE. Both cetuximab and RNAi of
TACE abrogated TGF-h–induced FAK activation and HER2
clustering with integrin (Fig. 3A and B). Transfection of a fulllength mouse TACE construct [TACE(HA)] reconstituted TGFh–induced effects in cells transfected with human TACE siRNA

treatment with TGF-h for 24 hours did not affect the abundance
of integrins a6, a3, and h1 on the cell surface while slightly
decreasing the surface levels of integrin h4 (Fig. 1B). By imunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis with HER2 and integrin
antibodies, TGF-h induced the association between HER2 and
integrins a6, h1, and h4 at 1 hour after treatment without
affecting their total levels. Although expression of integrin a3 was
detected in these cells by immunoblot, HER2 did not associate
with this integrin in the absence or presence of TGF-h (Fig. 1C).
In 10A/HER2 and in HER2-overexpressing MDA-MB-453 and
BT474 breast cancer cells, HER2 was detected in ECM-associated
complexes, and this association was markedly increased by TGF-h
(Fig. 1D). The level of cell surface–localized HER2, as determined
by surface biotinylation followed by pull-down with streptavidin
beads and HER2 immunoblot, was not affected by TGF-h in all
three cell lines. Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of intracellular protein
transport, abrogated the cell-surface localization of HER2 and its
association with the ECM (Fig. 1D).
TGF-B activates Src-FAK, leading to receptor clustering and
activation of PI3K-Akt. It has been shown that the membraneproximal clustering of integrin and RTK requires the scaffolding
function of FAK (3). Thus, to determine the role of the FAK in TGFh–modulated clustering of HER2 and integrin, we performed
immunoprecipitation with HER2 and integrin h1 antibodies
followed by FAK immunoblot. FAK associated with both HER2
and integrin h1, and this association was increased by the addition
of TGF-h in the same time course as it induced HER2:integrin

cells grown on six-well plates were transfected by siRNA oligonucleotides targeting human TACE or a control sequence. To rescue TACE expression, a plasmid
encoding the full-length mouse TACE [TACE(HA)] or empty vector (vec ) was cotransfected with the siRNA oligonucleotides. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells
were serum starved for 16 h and treated with TGF-h or PBS (vehicle control) for 1 h before being subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. C, MCF10A/HER2
cells were serum starved for 16 h and pretreated with PP2 or DMSO (vehicle control) for 1 h before being treated with TGF-a (10 ng/mL) or PBS (vehicle control)
for 1 h and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. Bands were quantified using ImageJ, with untreated cell samples (first lanes) set as 1.0.

regulates HER2 signaling by inducing its association with the
actin cytoskeleton and relocalization to lamellipodia in a PI3Kdependent manner (13). Integrin receptors are also anchored to
the cytoskeleton through adaptor proteins such as FAK (23).
In this study, TGF-h induced association of actin with both
HER2 and integrin a6; this association was impaired by the HER2
tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib ditosylate and the Src kinase
inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 5A). Expression of dominant-negative p85
also abolished the association of integrin h1 with actin and
HER2:FAK:integrin complex formation (Fig. 5B ). Treatment
with cytochalasin D, a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization,
impaired FAK phosphorylation and receptor clustering on TGF-h
treatment and diminished HER2 signaling in both basal and
TGF-h–treated conditions (Fig. 5C). Basal Akt phosphorylation
was increased as a result of cytochalasin D treatment; the
mechanism of this is unknown, but we speculate that it may
reflect a compensatory cellular response to the stress from drug
treatment.
Inhibition of Src-FAK reverses TGF-B–induced resistance
to trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.
In a recent work, we have shown that TGF-h up-regulates PI3K/
Akt and, in turn, desensitizes HER2-overexpressing cells to
trastuzumab (22). Here we further found that FAK was phosphorylated at Y397 and associated with PI3K p85 on TGF-h

(Fig. 3B). Further, EGFR activation by its ligand TGF-a was
sufficient to induce activation of the Src-FAK pathway as well as
receptor clustering. This was impaired by the addition of the Src
kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 3C). In HER2-overexpressing BT-474
breast cancer cells, TGF-h also induced Src activation and HER2
clustering with integrin; both effects were abolished by TACE
siRNA oligonucleotides or the addition of PP2 (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B).
Integrin A6 is essential for the clustering of HER2, integrin
B1, and FAK. Clustering between HER2 and integrin has only been
observed with integrins a6h1 and a6h4, suggesting a unique role of
a6 integrin in HER2 signaling. We further evaluated the function of
this integrin in HER2 signaling and its cross talk with the TGF-h
network using RNA interference. Knockdown of a6 expression
abolished the formation of the HER2:FAK:integrin complex and
impaired FAK-mediated PI3K signaling to Akt (Fig. 4A). In addition,
the ability of TGF-h to enhance migration and survival in MCF10A/
HER2 cells in serum-free medium was lost on depletion of a6
integrin or FAK (Fig. 4B and C). TGF-h induced invasion of 10A/
HER2 cells on laminin but not collagen; this effect was also
impaired when a6 integrin or FAK was knocked down with siRNA
oligonucleotides (Fig. 4D).
TGF-B induces association of HER2 and integrins with the
cytoskeleton. We have previously shown that TGF-h spatially

prometastatic factor in established or invasive tumors through a
combination of autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (24, 25).
Coexpression of activated oncogenes is a cue to the protumorigenic functions of TGF-h. In cancer models that depend on Neu
(ErbB2), PyVMT, or mutant Ras, TGF-h synergizes with these
oncogenes to accelerate cancer progression and metastasis (8, 10,
26–28). Recent work (22) and data shown herein indicate that in
HER2 (ErbB2)-overexpressing cells, TGF-h enhances ErbB-initiated
signal transduction by increasing ErbB ligand shedding, HER2containing heterodimers, and their cross talk with integrins
(Fig. 5D). The latter is mediated by the activation of Src-FAK;
inhibition of this kinase complex not only abolishes the ability of
TGF-h to facilitate cancer progression but also reverses TGFh–mediated resistance to trastuzumab. Interestingly, RNA interference of integrin a6 or FAK completely abrogated the prosurvival
and promigratory functions of TGF-h in HER2-overexpressing cells

stimulation; knockdown of FAK using siRNA oligonucleotides
abolished TGF-h–mediated Akt activation (Fig. 2C). Therefore,
we speculated that inhibition of Src-FAK might reverse TGF-h–
induced resistance to trastuzumab. To explore this, we cultured
HER2-overexpressing BT-474 breast cancer cells on Matrigel in the
absence or presence of TGF-h and PP2 and examined their
responses to trastuzumab. Addition of PP2 blocked the protective
effect of TGF-h and restored trastuzumab action in BT-474 cells
(Fig. 6), consistent with the ability of the Src inhibitor to inhibit
P-Akt (shown in Figs. 2 and 3).

Discussion
TGF-h is known to play dual roles in tumor progression.
Whereas it functions as a tumor suppressor in normal cells or
during early stages of tumorigenesis, it is often found as a

Figure 5. TGF-h induces association of HER2 and integrin with the cytoskeleton. A, MCF10A/HER2 cells were serum starved for 16 h and pretreated with PP2 or
lapatinib (1 Amol/L) or DMSO (vehicle control) for 1 h before being treated with TGF-h or PBS (vehicle control) for 1 h and subjected to immunoprecipitation and
immunoblot. B, MCF10A/HER2 cells grown on six-well plates were infected by adenoviruses encoding the dominant negative (DN ) PI3K p85 subunit or control viruses
expressing h-gal (multiplicity of infection, 1:5). Sixteen hours after infection, cells were serum starved for 16 h and treated with TGF-h or PBS (vehicle control) for
1 h before being subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. C, MCF10A/HER2 cells were serum starved for 16 h and pretreated with cytochalasin D (5 Amol/L)
or DMSO (vehicle control) for 1 h before being treated with TGF-h or PBS (vehicle control) for 1 h and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. D, TGF-h
induces membrane-proximal clustering of HER2 and integrins by activating Src-FAK and receptor association to cytoskeleton. Signals from extracellular TGF-h
are transduced into cells through TGF-h receptors. Activated type I TGF-h receptor (TbRI ) induces phosphorylation of TACE, resulting in its translocation to the cell
surface, where TACE cleaves EGFR proligands. EGFR ligands will initiate autocrine and paracrine EGFR signaling, which is amplified in HER2-overexpressing
cells, leading to Src-FAK activation and cytoskeleton rearrangement; both are required for the membrane-proximal clustering of HER2 and integrin.

mediated cross talk between RTKs and integrins is required for
receptor activation.
Integrin signaling has been shown to play a crucial role in ErbB2mediated mammary tumorigenesis. Integrin h4 amplifies ErbB2
signaling to promote mammary tumor onset and invasion in
transgenic mice (4). Moreover, deletion of the h4 signaling domain
enhances the efficacy of gefitinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of the
EGFR tyrosine kinase (4). The role of the Src-FAK complex on
regulating the transforming role of integrins suggests that it can be
targeted therapeutically in human cancers. Inhibitors of the Src
kinase are currently in early clinical development for the treatment
of solid tumors including breast cancer. In addition, amplified
TGF-h signaling has been shown to up-regulate PI3K and
desensitize the antitumor effect of HER2 antagonist trastuzumab
(22). Our data herein further suggest that (a) Src-FAK is essential for
the activation of PI3K that results from the interaction between
HER2 and TGF-h, and (b) inhibition of Src-FAK reverses TGFh–induced resistance to HER2 antagonist trastuzumab.

(Fig. 4C), suggesting that integrin-regulated interactions of HER2
with the actin cytoskeleton, and not the total levels of HER2
protein, can specify the qualitative response to TGF-h.
In a previous study, we have examined effects of TGF-h on the
cellular distribution and signaling of HER2 using MCF10A/HER2
and breast cancer lines that naturally overexpress the protooncogene. In these cells, treatment with TGF-h activates PI3K and
activates the Vav2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which then
activates Rac1 and its effector Pak1, resulting in colocalization
of HER2 with these molecules as well as actin cytoskeleton
components at cell protrusions (13). Here we show that FAK is
required for PI3K/Akt activation by TGF-h. In addition to
activating PI3K/Akt, FAK is also known to activate CAS-Crk-Rac
signaling and regulate the assembly and turnover of focal
adhesions at the leading lamellipodia of migrating cells. This
occurs through the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion
and cytoskeleton rearrangement (Fig. 5D).
The dual kinase Src/FAK complex has an established role in
human cancers (29). In cancers, both growth factor receptor and
FAK signaling are up-regulated. Autophosphorylation of FAK on
Y397 creates a SH2 domain binding site that can recruit and
activate Src. FAK phosphorylated at this site has been found in
various tumors including ovarian carcinoma, cervical carcinoma,
and acute myeloid leukemia (reviewed in ref. 29). Phosphorylation
of this site is also responsible for the direct association of FAK with
the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, as well as the activation of
PI3K by ligand-bound PDGFR (21). Thus, FAK integrates both
growth factor RTK and integrin networks and serves as an effector
for these two signaling systems. Indeed, cells lacking FAK are
refractory to EGF- or PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
EGFR and PDGFR, respectively, and cell motility (3). Consistently,
FAK RNAi suppressed both basal and TGF-h–induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR (Fig. 2C), suggesting that FAK-
