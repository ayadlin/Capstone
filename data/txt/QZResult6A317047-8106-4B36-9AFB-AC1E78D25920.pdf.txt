Abstract
Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a potent lipid mediator formed by
phosphorylation of sphingosine, a metabolite of sphingolipids,
catalyzed by two sphingosine kinase (SphK) isoenzymes,
SphK1 and SphK2. Expression of SphK2, which is enriched
in the nucleus of MCF7 human breast cancer cells, increased
expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 but
had no effect on p53 or its phosphorylation. The anticancer
drug doxorubicin is known to increase p21 via p53-dependent
and p53-independent mechanisms. Down-regulation of endogenous SphK2 with small interfering RNA targeted to unique
mRNA sequences decreased basal and doxorubicin-induced
expression of p21 without affecting increased expression of
p53. Down-regulation of SphK2 also decreased G2-M arrest
and markedly enhanced apoptosis induced by doxorubicin.
Moreover, siSphK2 reduced doxorubicin-induced p21 expression in p53-inactivated MCF7 cells. Likewise, in human wildtype p53- and p21-expressing HCT116 colon carcinoma cells,
as well as in p53-null counterparts, down-regulation of SphK2
markedly reduced p21 induction by doxorubicin. Knockdown
of SphK2 sensitized HCT116 cells to apoptosis induced by
doxorubicin with concomitant cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase. Collectively, our results show that endogenous
SphK2 is important for p53-independent induction of p21
expression by doxorubicin and suggest that SphK2 may
influence the balance between cytostasis and apoptosis of
human cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10466–74]

Introduction
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is now emerging as a vital lipid
mediator that regulates a wide variety of physiologic and
pathologic processes (reviewed in refs. 1–3). S1P is the ligand for
five specific G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR; named S1P1-5).
These receptors are coupled to distinct G protein signaling pathways, enabling S1P to regulate numerous physiologic processes
particularly important for cancer, including growth, survival,
migration and invasion, and angiogenesis and vascular maturation (reviewed in refs. 4, 5). In addition, evidence suggests that S1P
may also have intracellular functions important for calcium homeostasis, cell growth, and suppression of apoptosis (1).

S1P is produced in cells by phosphorylation of sphingosine, the
backbone of sphingolipids, catalyzed by sphingosine kinase (SphK).
Two isoforms of mammalian SphK (SphK1 and SphK2) have been
cloned and characterized (5). Both have five conserved domains
and are highly homologous, but SphK2 has an extended NH2 terminus and a different central region. SphK1 and SphK2 have distinct localizations (6, 7), kinetic properties, and developmental and
tissue expression (8), suggesting that they have different functions.
Unlike SphK1, SphK2 has a somewhat lower substrate specificity
and also can phosphorylate the prodrug FTY720 (9–11), producing
an immunosuppressant that induces lymphopenia.
Numerous external stimuli, including growth factors, ligands for
GPCRs, proinflammatory cytokines, and cross-linking of immunoglobulin receptors (reviewed in refs. 1, 2), activate SphK1. To date,
only epidermal growth factor (EGF; ref. 12) and FcqRI triggering
(13) have been shown to stimulate SphK2. Many studies have
shown that SphK1 is critical for growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance of human breast cancers. For example, MCF7 cells
overexpressing SphK1 are more resistant to apoptosis induced by
doxorubicin (one of the most active antineoplastic agents used in
clinical oncology) and, when injected into mammary fat pads of
ovariectomized nude mice, produce larger tumors with higher
microvessel density in the periphery (14). Moreover, in these cells,
estrogen transactivates EGF receptor by stimulating SphK1 (15).
Down-regulation of SphK1 in MCF7 cells reduced EGF- and serumstimulated growth and enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin (16).
SphK1 is overexpressed in breast tumors and SphK1 inhibitors are
antiproliferative toward a panel of breast cancer cell lines, including those with the multidrug resistance phenotype, and suppressed
growth of mammary adenocarcinoma tumors in mice (17).
Much less is known of the functions of SphK2. Its overexpression has been shown to suppress cell growth and enhance apoptosis (8, 18). The nuclear localization sequence of SphK2 was
required for inhibition of DNA synthesis when overexpressed in
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (18). Induction of apoptosis by overexpressed
SphK2 was independent of activation of S1P receptors but required
its putative Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) and estrogen receptor
localization (19, 20). A recent study showed an essential requirement for SphK2 in a sphingolipid apoptosis pathway activated
by FTY720 analogues (21). It has been suggested that SphK1 and
SphK2 have opposing roles in the regulation of salvage of sphingosine and its reuse for ceramide biosynthesis (20), indicating that
the location of S1P production dictates its functions. However,
mice with a deficiency of either SphK1 or SphK2 develop normally,
yet the double knockout is embryonically lethal due to severely
abnormal neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and massive apoptosis in
the brain (7). Therefore, SphK1 and SphK2 might have overlapping
and/or complementary physiologic functions. In agreement, both
SphK1 and SphK2 were required for EGF-induced migration of
MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells (12).

SphK2 in p53-Indendent Induction of p21

In this study, we investigated the functions of endogenous SphK2
in carcinoma cells and how it influences the balance between cytostasis and apoptosis in response to the chemotherapeutic anthracyclin doxorubicin. We found that endogenous SphK2 is critical for
p53-independent induction of p21 expression by doxorubicin and its
apoptotic actions in human breast and colon cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Doxorubicin was purchased from Sigma, reconstituted in
molecular biology grade water, and stored protected from light. Serum and
medium were from Biofluids. Antibodies to p21, lamin A/C, caspase-7,
phosphorylated p53 (Ser15), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were
purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-p53 antibody was from Oncogene. Antiunderphosphorylated Rb antibody was from Transduction Laboratories.
Anti-protein disulfide isomerase antibody was from Stressgen Biotechnologies. Antitubulin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. SphK2
rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a unique SphK2 peptide
sequence (QALHIQRLRPKPEARPR) was purified as described (12). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
cDNA cloning and expression vectors. Construction of human SphK2
(UniProt: Q9NRA0-2) expression vectors has been described previously
(8, 12). SphK2 with an NH2-terminal extension of 36 amino acids (SphK2-L,

UniProt: Q9NRA0-1) was amplified from cDNA isolated from HEK 293 cells
by PCR using Platinum Taq Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) with
5¶-CACCATGAATGGACACCTTGAA-3¶ and 5¶-TCCGGGCTCCCGCCCCGG-3¶
sense and antisense primers, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into
pcDNA 3.1 V5-His vector (Invitrogen). All sequences were verified by DNA
sequencing and protein expression after transfection of HEK 293 cells was
confirmed by Western blotting with anti-SphK2 and anti-V5 antibodies (12).
Cell culture and transfection. MCF7 cells were cultured in phenol
red–free improved minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.25%
glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MCF7 cells infected with pLXSN
vector only (MCF7/Vec) and infected with human papillomavirus-16
(HPV-16) E6 (MCF7/E6) were described previously (22). HCT116 wild-type
(WT), p21 / , and p53 / cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS. MCF7 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus
(Invitrogen) and cultured overnight. SphK2 expression in MCF7 and HCT116
cells was down-regulated by transfection with sequence-specific small
interfering RNA (siRNA) for human SphK2 (sense, 5¶-GGAUUGCGCUCGUCGCUUUCAU-3¶; antisense, 5¶-AUGAAAGCGAGCGCAAUCCTG-3¶; Ambion)
and control siRNA (Ambion) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). In addition, ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA against SphK2 and control
siRNA from Dharmacon were used to confirm lack of off-target effects. In
some experiments, siRNA targeted to another human SphK2 sequence
(5¶-GCTGGGCTGTCCTTCAACCT-3¶; Qiagen) and control siRNA (Qiagen)
were used.

and subsequently cultured for 24 h in the presence of serum, fixed, and immunostained with anti-V5 antibody followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei
were also stained with Hoechst 33342 and colocalization (yellow ) was shown in the merged pictures. Cells were visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy.
Representative cells of f100 cells examined are shown. B to D, MCF7 cells transiently transfected with vector, V5-SphK2-S (B), V5-SphK2-L (C), or V5-SphK1
(D ) were cultured in the absence or presence of doxorubicin (1 Ag/mL) for 24 h. Equal amounts of cell lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then
immunoblotted with SphK2, V5, p21, p53, or phosphorylated p53 (Ser15; p-p53 ) antibodies as indicated. Membranes were subsequently probed with tubulin antibody to
show equal loading. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments.

Figure 2. SphK2 is mainly a nuclear protein in MCF7 cells. A, cytosol and membrane fractions from naive MCF7 and HEK 293 cells were prepared by centrifugation
at 100,000  g. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-SphK2 antibody. Cell lysate from MCF7 cells transiently
transfected with V5-tagged SphK2-S was included as a positive control. B, MCF7 cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeted to SphK2. After 48 h,
nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared using NE-PER cytoplasm and nuclear extraction reagents. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with anti-SphK2. Antibodies against lamin A/C and tubulin were used as nuclei and cytoplasm markers, respectively. Cell lysates from MCF7 cells
transiently transfected with untagged SphK2-S or untagged SphK2-L were included to indicate the molecular weight of these proteins. Similar results were obtained in
two additional experiments. C and D, down-regulation of SphK2 with siRNA. MCF7 cells were transfected with control siRNA (white columns ) or siRNA targeted to
SphK2 (black columns ). C, after 48 h, equal amounts of cell lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-SphK2 antibody. Blots
were stripped and probed with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2 ) antibody as a loading control. SphK2 levels were normalized to total ERK2, and the
ratio relative to siControl is indicated. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05. D, RNA was isolated from duplicate cultures and
mRNA levels of SphK1 and SphK2 and 18s RNA were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Nuclear fractions were also isolated and SphK2 activity was
measured. Inset, equal amounts of nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-SphK2 antibody.

Western blot analysis. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were lysed in
buffer containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1%
Triton X-100, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L sodium
orthovanadate, 4 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mmol/L NaF, and
1:500 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equal amounts of proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transblotted to nitrocellulose, blocked with
5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated
with primary antibodies overnight. Appropriate horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies were added in TBS containing 5% nonfat
milk. Immunoreactive signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Chemical Co.) and blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film.
Where indicated, relative amounts of immunoreactive protein in each band
were determined by scanning densitometric analysis of the X-ray films
with the AlphaEase FC 4.0 (Innotech) program and normalized to the
appropriate loading control.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. MCF7 cells were
grown on four-chambered slides (Nalge Nunc) and transfected with
V5-tagged SphK2-S or SphK2-L. Subcellular localization studies using
confocal microscopy were done as described previously (20). Briefly, cells
were washed with PBS, fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% para-

formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min.
After washing, cells were incubated for 45 min with anti-V5 antibody in PBS
containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then for 45 min with
secondary antibody conjugated with FITC. Coverslips were mounted on
glass slides using an antifade kit and examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser
confocal microscope.
Nuclear extracts. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated from
MCF7 cells using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic isolation kit (Pierce
Chemical) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II (Invitrogen).
For real-time PCR, premixed primer-probe sets were purchased from
Applied Biosystems and cDNA was amplified with ABI 7900HT.
SphK2 activity measurements. SphK2 activity was determined with
sphingosine added as a complex with 4 mg/mL BSA and [g-32P]ATP in the
presence of 1 mol/L KCl, conditions in which SphK2 activity is optimal and
SphK1 is strongly inhibited (8) exactly as described (12).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were trypsinized, washed, fixed, and stained
with propidium iodide (0.05 mg/mL in 3.8 Amol/L sodium citrate, 0.1%
Triton X-100, and 7 kilounits/mL RNase B) for 2 h and analyzed on a

Beckman Coulter XL-MCL flow cytometer. Cell cycle profiles were evaluated
using ModFit LT 3.0 (Verity Software House).
Cell death assays. Apoptotic cell death was measured by staining cell
nuclei with the Hoechst dye bisbenzimide and apoptotic cells were identified by condensed, fragmented nuclear regions as described previously
(20). A minimum of 300 cells was scored. PARP cleavage and activation of
caspase-7 were also determined with antibodies that recognize cleaved
products as described previously (16). Cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol was determined by immunoblotting with anticytochrome c as described previously (20).
Statistical analysis. Experiments were repeated at least thrice with
consistent results. For each experiment, the data from triplicate samples
were calculated and expressed as mean F SD. Differences between groups
were determined with Student’s t test or a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey
post hoc test, and P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
SphK2 up-regulates p21 in MCF7 cells independently of p53.
SphK1 is mainly cytosolic and several growth factors induce its
translocation to the plasma membrane (23–25), which is important
for its oncogenic functions (26). In contrast, the localization of
endogenous SphK2 is still unclear as it may be different in different
cell types (6, 12, 18, 20, 27). Although possessing a putative nuclear
localization signal, overexpressed SphK2 was mainly cytosolic in
HEK 293 cells but was localized to the nucleus of HeLa cells (18)
and in endothelial cells was present in the cytosol, in perinuclear
structures, and in the nucleus (27). In agreement, both SphK2-S and
SphK2-L were expressed mainly in the nucleus of MCF7 cells
determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A). In contrast to HEK 293 cells (6, 20) but similar to
HeLa cells (18), the localization of either splice variant was not
affected by serum withdrawal (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Western
blot analysis revealed major protein bands with the predicted
molecular masses (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and lysates from these

cells had significantly increased sphingosine phosphorylating activity (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Previous studies have shown that overexpression of SphK2 in
contrast to SphK1 reduces cell growth (6, 18–20). However, it is
not known how SphK2 inhibits cell proliferation. p21WAF1/CIP1
(hereafter referred to as p21), a member of a family of cyclindependent kinase inhibitors, is an important negative regulator
of cell progression and prevents aberrant mitosis leading to cell
death (28). Therefore, it was of interest to examine the effects
of SphK2 expression on p21. SphK2-S increased levels of p21
compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, SphK2-L
also increased p21 (Fig. 1C). In agreement with numerous reports
(29–31), treatment with the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin
markedly increased levels of p21 and its transcriptional activator
p53 (Fig. 1B and C). In the presence of doxorubicin, overexpression
of SphK2-S did not significantly increase p21 further (Fig. 1B),
whereas SphK2-L slightly increased it (Fig. 1C). However, neither
SphK2-S nor SphK2-L expression altered p53 levels. Moreover,
neither SphK2 splice form influenced p53 levels induced by doxorubicin (Fig. 1B and C). Among the multiple modification sites on
p53, phosphorylation at Ser15 in response to DNA damage correlates with both the accumulation of total p53 protein and its
functional activation (32). As expected, doxorubicin induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15. However, SphK2 expression had no
significant effects on this phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Doxorubicin
also slightly decreased the level of endogenous SphK2 (Fig. 1B).
In contrast to SphK2, expression of SphK1 had no effect on p21
expression (Fig. 1D).
Endogenous SphK2 is predominantly localized to the
nucleus in MCF7 cells. Although all experiments with overexpression of SphK2 were restricted to moderate increases in
SphK2 expression (Fig. 1A), it was important to examine localization and functions of endogenous SphK2. To this end, we used

experiments. Relative p21 levels were normalized to tubulin. Columns, mean fold change relative to siControl from three independent experiments; bars, SD.

of apoptosis. A minimum of three different fields was analyzed, scoring a minimum of 300 cells. D, proteins from duplicate cultures were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against cytochrome c (Cyto c ), cleaved caspase-7, and cleaved PARP. Blots were stripped and reprobed with

rabbit polyclonal anti-SphK2 antibodies, which we previously used
to identify endogenous SphK2 in HEK 293 cells by Western blotting
analyses (12). In MCF7 cells, an immunoreactive band with the
same apparent molecular mass as the endogenous SphK2 previously detected in HEK 293 and MDA-MB-453 cells was present
mainly in the cellular membrane fraction (Fig. 2A). Based on initial
studies with subcellular fractions prepared by differential centrifugation, we observed that, in contrast to HEK 293 and MDAMB-453 cells where the majority of endogenous SphK2 was in the
plasma membrane fraction (12), endogenous SphK2 in MCF7 cells
was readily detected in the nuclear fraction and barely detectable in other subcellular fractions (data not shown). Because the
nuclear proteins are very dilute after subcellular fractionation,
more concentrated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared with NE-PER reagents. In agreement with confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A), endogenous SphK2 was clearly localized in the
nuclei of MCF7 cells (Fig. 2B).
It has recently been suggested that SphK2-L is the predominant
splice variant in several human cell lines and tissues (6). However,
although mRNA for SphK2-L could be detected by quantitative
PCR, endogenous nuclear SphK2 in MCF7 cells had similar
electrophoretic mobility as untagged SphK2-S rather than untagged
SphK2-L (Fig. 2B). To further examine the localization and function
of endogenous SphK2 in MCF7 cells, its expression was downregulated by a siRNA targeted to a specific SphK2 sequence. siRNA
directed toward SphK2 significantly decreased SphK2 protein
(Fig. 2B and C) and mRNA (Fig. 2D) without changing the level of
S1P2, S1P3, or S1P5 mRNA (data not shown). It should be noted that
reduction of SphK2 protein levels in the nucleus with siSphK2 was
also accompanied by a decrease in nuclear SphK2 activity (Fig. 2D).
Collectively, these data suggest that the predominant splice variant
of SphK2 in MCF7 cells, which is expressed in the nucleus, is the
short form.
Involvement of endogenous SphK2 in doxorubicin-induced
up-regulation of p21 and apoptosis. To explore the role of endogenous SphK2 in responses of MCF7 cells to doxorubicin, we
examined the effect of SphK2 knockdown on doxorubicin-induced
p21 and p53 expression. Decreasing endogenous levels of SphK2
using siSphK2 decreased induction of p21 on exposure to
doxorubicin but had no effect on doxorubicin-induced p53 expression (Fig. 3A). To exclude nonspecific off-target effects, SphK2
expression was also down-regulated with siRNA targeted to two
other regions of the SphK2 sequence. These siSphK2s, but not
scrambled siRNA controls, also markedly reduced expression of
SphK2 mRNA and protein. They also almost completely abolished
p21 expression induced by doxorubicin without significantly altering expression of p53 (Fig. 3A; data not shown). As expected
(30, 33), doxorubicin increased transcription of p21 (Fig. 3B).
Down-regulation of SphK2 but not SphK1 markedly reduced the
effect of doxorubicin on p21 mRNA expression (Fig. 3B).
The involvement of endogenous SphK2 in doxorubicin-induced
MCF7 cell cycle checkpoints was next examined by flow cytometry
analysis. In agreement with several previous reports (29, 30, 34),
doxorubicin produced a marked increase in the proportion of
cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle ( from 23.1 F 1.6% to 53.4 F
2.3%). The fraction of siSphK2-transfected cells in G2-M phase
of the cell cycle was 21.2 F 1.8% and 26.8 F 2.2% in the absence
or presence of doxorubicin, respectively. Thus, down-regulation of
SphK2 prevented the doxorubicin-induced G2-M arrest.
Because down-regulating SphK2 reduced p21 (Fig. 3A), and
inhibiting p21 expression influences the outcome of a p53 response

to doxorubicin in favor of cell death (30, 35), we next examined
the effect of siSphK2 on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Exposure
of MCF7 cells to doxorubicin for 24 h only induced minimal
apoptosis (Fig. 3C), in agreement with previous studies (16, 34).
Although down-regulation of SphK1 did not induce apoptotic cell
death of MCF7 cells (16), siSphK2, but not siControl, induced
apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Moreover, siSphK2 sensitized MCF7 cells to
apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Fig. 3C). In agreement, downregulation of SphK2 induced apoptotic traits, including activation
of caspase-7, the main effector caspase in MCF7 cells (36), and

cleavage of PARP, a substrate for caspase-mediated proteolysis
during apoptosis (Fig. 3D). Moreover, down-regulation of SphK2
further enhanced doxorubicin-induced PARP cleavage, caspase-7
activation, and increased cytochrome c release to the cytosol
(Fig. 3D), suggesting that loss of SphK2 enhances sensitivity to
chemotherapy.
Involvement of endogenous SphK2 in doxorubicin-induced
up-regulation of p21 and apoptosis in MCF7 cells lacking p53.
To further substantiate the notion that endogenous SphK2 is
important for p53-independent induction of p21 by doxorubicin,
MCF7 cells were infected with HPV-16 E6, which targets p53
protein for ubiquitination and degradation, thereby inactivating
p53 function (37). In agreement with previous studies (22), there
was no induction of p53 by doxorubicin in these cells (Fig. 4A).
Nevertheless, doxorubicin slightly increased p21 in MCF7/E6 cells,
and as expected, this response was greatly attenuated compared
with MCF7/Vec cells infected with pLXSN. Down-regulation of
SphK2 in MCF7/E6 cells also abolished the increase in p21 induced
by doxorubicin (Fig. 4B). Reduction of SphK2 also sensitized
these p53-deficient MCF7 cells to apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, as determined by cleavage of PARP and appearance of
condensed nuclei (Fig. 4B and C), although apoptosis was somewhat attenuated compared with the p53 counterparts (Fig. 4C).
SphK2 is also involved in doxorubicin-induced up-regulation
of p21 in a p53-independent manner in HCT116 human colon
carcinoma cells. It was of interest to examine the involvement of
SphK2 in regulation of p21 expression by doxorubicin in another
type of cancer cell. Human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were
used for several reasons: SphK2 is also present in the nucleus of
these cells (Fig. 5A); siRNA targeted to SphK2 markedly reduced
its expression without affecting expression of SphK1 determined by

real-time PCR (Fig. 5B); and finally, isogenic cell lines derived from
human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells in which p53 and p21 were
inactivated by targeted homologous recombination have been
extensively studied to examine the roles of these proteins in
apoptosis in response to doxorubicin (29, 35, 38, 39). As in MCF7
cells, decreasing endogenous levels of SphK2 with siSphK2
decreased induction of p21 on exposure to doxorubicin but had
no significant effect on doxorubicin-induced p53 expression in WT
HCT116 cells (Fig. 5C). As expected, the doxorubicin-induced
increase in p21 in HCT116 p53 / cells was greatly attenuated
compared with WT cells (Fig. 5C). Down-regulation of SphK2 in
HCT116 p53 / cells markedly reduced this small increase in p21
induced by doxorubicin (Fig. 5C). Knockdown of SphK2 did not
significantly influence the increase in p53 levels in response to
doxorubicin in either WT or p21 / cells.
Down-regulation of SphK2 sensitized WT HCT116 cells to
apoptosis induced by doxorubicin and concomitantly increased
PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A and B). In agreement with previous studies
(29, 30, 35, 40), death induced by doxorubicin was increased in p21 /
cells (Fig. 6B). Reduction of SphK2 expression only marginally
increased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in these p21-null cells
(Fig. 6B). A higher level of cleavage of PARP and apoptosis was also
observed in SphK2 down-regulated HCT116 p53 / cells treated with
doxorubicin (Fig. 6B). Collectively, these results support the notion
that p21 expression regulated by endogenous SphK2 impedes the
progression of the apoptotic pathway.

Discussion
It is now well established that SphK1 promotes cell growth,
inhibits apoptosis induced by anticancer agents, enhances

real-time PCR. C, HCT116 WT, p21 / , and p53 / were transfected with siControl or siSphK2 and then cultured in the absence or presence of doxorubicin (1 Amol/L)
for 18 h. Equal amounts of cell lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against SphK2, p53, and p21. Blots were stripped
and reprobed with tubulin antibody to show equal loading. Similar results were obtained in three additional experiments.

*, P < 0.05. C, proposed model depicting the involvement
of SphK2 in doxorubicin-induced expression of p21 and
apoptosis. Doxorubicin induces expression of p53 leading
to induction to proapoptotic factors, such as BAX, NOXA,
and PUMA, and cell death and also induces p21.
Doxorubicin can also enhance expression of p21 in a
p53-independent manner. SphK2 contributes to induction
of p21 independently of p53. Down-regulation of SphK2
prevents induction of p21 and removes p21-mediated
protection against apoptosis, enabling cell death.

tumorigenicity in animal models, is up-regulated in many human
cancers, and correlates with poor prognosis (4, 5). However, very few
studies have examined the functions of endogenous SphK2 and it
is still not clear whether SphK1 and SphK2 have redundant, overlapping, complementary, or antagonistic functions in human cancer
cells. In MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells, SphK1 and SphK2
have overlapping and/or complementary functions in regulation
of EGF-induced migration. In contrast, only SphK1, but not SphK2,
was required for migration of HEK 293 cells toward EGF (12).
Although overexpression of SphK2 induces growth arrest and
enhances apoptosis (6, 18–20), surprisingly, decreasing SphK2
expression inhibited glioblastoma cell proliferation and enhanced
apoptosis more potently than did SphK1 knockdown (41). Similarly,
we found that loss of SphK2 greatly sensitized MCF7 cells to
mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in the presence of doxorubicin as shown by increased release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria into the cytosol and activated caspase-7 and PARP
cleavage, suggesting that endogenous SphK2 may regulate sensitivity to chemotherapy. Loss of SphK2 also sensitized HCT116
cells to apoptosis. Interestingly, although neither SphK1- nor
SphK2-null mice have an obvious phenotype, the double knock-

outs have a dramatic increase in apoptosis in the developing nervous system (7).
Collectively, these results raise the conundrum of how overexpression of SphK2 decreases cell growth and enhances apoptosis (6, 18–20), whereas its down-regulation sensitizes cells to
apoptosis. A simple answer may be provided by our results and
those of others showing that, when SphK2 is overexpressed, not
all of the overexpressed protein has the same subcellular distribution as endogenous SphK2 and may cause nonphysiologic
effects. SphK2 contains a putative a-helical BH3 domain analogous to that present in other BH3-only proapoptotic proteins
(19), such as BIM and BID. As short BH3 domain peptides can
induce oligomerization of BAK and BAX releasing cytochrome c
to sensitize mitochondrial apoptosis (42), it is possible that proteolysis of overexpressed SphK2 might induce apoptosis due to
liberation of its BH3 peptide domain. Finally, it has been suggested that the molecular balance between apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest is determined in part by the level of p21. In case of a
high level of p21 expression, cells are arrested in G2, whereas
blockage of p21 expression directly leads to apoptosis (30, 35, 39,
43, 44).

SphK2 in p53-Indendent Induction of p21

Two SphK2 splice variants have been described, the originally
reported 68-kDa form, designated SphK2-S (8), and the NH2terminal extended 72-kDa SphK2-L (6, 10). Based mainly on realtime quantitative PCR of mRNA using primer sets that differentiate
between SphK2-S and SphK2-L, it has been suggested that SphK2-L
is the predominant form in human cell lines and tissues (6).
However, the presence of endogenous SphK2 protein forms was not
directly examined in these studies. Using Western blotting with an
antibody directed against a peptide sequence present in both
SphK2-S and SphK2-L, we detected an immunopositive band that
was down-regulated by siSphK2, which had a similar electrophoretic mobility as SphK2-S rather than SphK2-L. Our results clearly
indicate that the endogenous form of SphK2 expressed in MCF7
cells, which is particularly enriched in the nucleus, is not SphK2-L
but rather SphK2-S.
Although the function of SphK2 in the nucleus is not clear,
we found that endogenous SphK2 is important for doxorubicininduced expression of p21 independently of p53. Several lines of
evidence support this notion. First, overexpression of SphK2
increased expression of p21 in MCF7 cells without affecting p53
levels or its activation. In contrast, overexpression of SphK1 had no
effect on either p21 or p53 expression. Second, down-regulation
of endogenous SphK2 markedly reduced basal and doxorubicininduced p21 without affecting p53 expression in MCF7 breast
cancer cells and HCT116 colon cancer cells. Finally, in MCF7 cells
that lack functional p53 or in p53-null HCT116 cells, downregulation of SphK2 completely abrogated doxorubicin-induced
expression of p21.
p21 seems to be a major determinant of cell fate in response to
anticancer therapy as it plays an essential role in growth arrest
after DNA damage (28, 45) and inhibits p53-dependent and p53independent apoptosis (29). Thus, repression of p21 by gene
targeting, overexpression of c-Myc, or chemical p21 inhibitors all
sensitize tumor cells to apoptosis by anticancer drugs (30, 39, 46).
Indeed, down-regulation of SphK2 inhibited doxorubicin-induced

G2 checkpoint arrest, consistent with the failure of these cells to
up-regulate p21 in response to doxorubicin. It also sensitized them
to apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. Collectively, our results
suggest that SphK2 may be one of the gatekeepers that influence
the balance between cytostasis and apoptosis in response to
doxorubicin (Fig. 6C). According to this idea, doxorubicin-induced
expression of p53, which in turn can induce p21, leads to cell cycle
arrest or induction of proapoptotic factors, including PUMA and
NOXA, leading to cell death (28, 30, 39). However, it has been
suggested that the presence of these proapoptotic factors induced
by p53 in response to DNA damage is not sufficient to initiate
apoptosis unless these events are coupled with improper cell cycle
progression due to the absence of p21 (28, 35, 39). Our results
indicate that SphK2 is required for maximal increases in p21
(independently of p53), which enables cell cycle arrest, DNA repair,
and prevention of execution of the cell death program. Downregulation of SphK2 expression represses p21 and switches the
response from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis (Fig. 6C), suggesting that SphK2 may influence the balance between cytostasis and
apoptosis of human cancer cells. It is tempting to speculate that
tumors that are highly responsive to doxorubicin might have
lower levels of SphK2. Moreover, targeting SphK2 to decrease
p21 expression may have the potential to improve the action of
anticancer drugs.
