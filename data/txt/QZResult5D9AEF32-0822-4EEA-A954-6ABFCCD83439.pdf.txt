Cell Death Identiﬁcation in Anticancer Therapy—Letter
J. Martin Brown1, Bradly G. Wouters2, and David G. Kirsch3

In their recent review, Rello-Varona and colleagues (1) emphasize that "The correct evaluation of cell death in every experimental setting related to cancer research is a must." Accordingly, they
discuss the variety of methods to identify dead cells and to
distinguish the various forms of cell death from one another.
While we agree with their descriptions of the different forms of cell
death and appreciate that the mechanism of cell death is often
worth characterizing in cancer research, we would emphasize
three aspects of cell killing that make the precise characterization
of the type of cell death less important than the quantiﬁcation of
cell survival using clonogenic endpoints when evaluating cancer
therapies:
(1)

The mode of cell death, though often not the eventual level
of killing (or survival), resulting from the majority of cancer
therapies (typically DNA-damaging agents), is highly
dependent on the genetics of the tumor cell. For example,
the amount of apoptosis occurring in cells in vitro, in solid
tumors, or in certain normal tissues can be markedly
affected by Bcl-2 (2) Bax or Bak1 (3), p53 or p21 (4) status,

without affecting the overall level of cell killing as
determined by clonogenic survival in vitro or by animal
survival. An important consequence of this is that any
particular cancer therapy could be judged to be effective or
ineffective if assessed only using assays for cell death (such
as apoptosis) as opposed to those measuring long term
survival.
The genetic background (and mode of cell death) strongly
inﬂuences the "rate" at which cells die. For example, the rate
of loss of viability is very different for p53 wild-type and
knockout cells, a fact that can render a 24-hour trypan blue
staining assay highly misleading for overall cell killing (5).
Cell viability assays will not detect cells made senescent by
the treatment. Senescence, although not technically a form
of cell death, can be an important contributor to the
effectiveness of anticancer agents. Senescence, along with all
other forms of cell death, will be captured using assays that
measure cell survival.

We believe that the above considerations are succinctly summarized by the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death 2012
(6): "During the process of functional characterization, great
attention should be paid to ensure that genetic and chemical
interventions truly modify the incidence of cell death (as assessed
by clonogenic cell survival), rather than activate alternative lethal
pathways."
