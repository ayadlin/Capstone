ABSTRACT:
The ABT-analogous 737, 263 and 199 are BH3 mimetics showing potent antimyeloma (MM) activity, but only on defined molecular subgroups of MM patients
presenting a Bcl-2high/Mcl-1low profile. IGF-1 is a major survival factor in MM regulating
the expression of Bcl-2 proteins and might therefore be a resistance factor to these
ABT-analogous. We first show that IGF-1 protected human MM cell lines (HMCLs)
against ABT-737. Concurrently, the IGF-1 receptor inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP)
synergistically sensitized HMCL, primary human MM and murine 5T33MM cells to
ABT-737 and ABT-199 by further decreasing cell viability and enhancing apoptosis.
Knockdown of Bcl-2 by shRNA protected MM cells to ABT-737, while Mcl-1 shRNA
sensitized the cells. PPP overcame the Bcl-2 dependency of ABT-737, but failed to
completely overcome the protective effect of Mcl-1. In vivo, co-treatment of 5T33MM
bearing mice significantly decreased tumor burden and prolonged overall survival
both in a prophylactic and therapeutic setting. Interestingly, proteasome inhibitor
resistant CD138- 5T33MM cells were more sensitive to ABT-737, whereas PPP alone
targeted the CD138+ cells more effectively. After co-treatment, both subpopulations
were targeted equally. Together, the combination of an IGF-1R inhibitor and an ABTanalogue displays synergistic anti-myeloma activity providing the rational for further
(pre)clinical testing.

RESULTS

in the clinic (e.g. bortezomib and lenalidomide), drug
resistance inevitably develops, resulting in relapse of
virtually all patients [1].
Drug resistance in cancer and MM has partly been
assigned to elevated expression of the anti-apoptotic
subfamily of Bcl-2 proteins. Three subfamilies can be
defined, namely the anti-apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl,
Mcl-1), pro-apoptotic Bax/Bak-like and pro-apoptotic
BH3-only (e.g. Bim, Bad, Noxa) protein subfamily [2, 3].
The balance of these Bcl-2 proteins determines if a cell
will undergo apoptosis. In light of the importance of the
Bcl-2 family in drug resistance, BH3-mimetics have been
designed. BH3-mimetics bind with high affinity to antiapoptotic proteins, thereby preventing sequestration of the
pro-apoptotic proteins and shifting the balance towards
apoptosis. ABT-737 and its orally bioavailable analogue
ABT-263 are potent, selective small-molecule inhibitors of
Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl, but not Mcl-1, showing potent clinical
activity towards several hematological malignancies [3-5].
However, thrombocytopenia caused by Bcl-Xl inhibition
proved to be the dose-limiting toxicity, thus limiting
the efficacy of ABT-737 and -263 [6, 7]. To solve this,
a new orally available high-affinity Bcl-2 selective BH3
mimetic, namely ABT-199, was developed only very
recently and was reported to be at least as effective as
ABT-737 and -263 without eliciting thrombocytopenia
[8, 9]. In MM, however, both ABT-737 and -199 are only
highly effective against one molecular subgroup with a
neutral prognostic value, namely the CCND1 subgroup,
of which the MM cells present a Bcl-2high/Mcl-1low profile
and depend on Bcl-2 for survival [10-12]. Since this
CCND1 subgroup represents only a small fraction of all
MM cases, the ABT-analogous thus hold little promise as
single agents in most MM cases. We and others showed
that IGF-1 is one of the two major growth and survival
factors in MM, regulating the expression of Bcl-2 family
members [13-17]. Moreover, the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)
is highly expressed on MM cells correlating with poor
prognosis and is therefore an attractive target in MM [17].
Previously, we demonstrated that picropodophyllin (PPP)
suppresses the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase activity and has
potent anti-myeloma activity both in human MM cells and
the murine 5TMM models [18, 19]. We hypothesized that
IGF-1 might antagonize the effect of ABT-analogous in
MM and that IGF-1R targeting therefore might overcome
this resistance. As a proof of concept, we decided to use
the most studied and characterized BH3 mimetic and
ABT-analogue, namely ABT-737. We first investigated
the protective effect of growth factors in general and more
specifically IGF-1 against ABT-737 mediated MM cell
death. Next, we evaluated the potential synergistic antiMM effect of ABT-737 and PPP using human MM cell
lines (HMCLs), primary human samples and the murine
5T33MM model.

IGF-1 protects against ABT-737 induced MM cell
death.
In an initial set of experiments, we compared the
effect of ABT-737 on MM cell viability and apoptosis in
complete growth versus serum-free medium using two
HMCLs that are described to show intermediate to low
sensitivity to the ABT-analogous, namely RPMI-8226 and
OPM-2 cells. In both cell lines, an increased response to
ABT-737 was observed when assayed under serum-free
conditions (Figure 1 A-D). At 48 hours, we observed
a simultaneous decrease in viability and increase in
apoptosis in the serum-free conditions, while observing
only minimal cytotoxicity of ABT-737 in complete growth
medium. The absolute number of apoptotic cells in the
control cells when treated in complete growth medium was
consistently below 20% for both cell lines. In addition, the
difference in % apoptosis of myeloma cell lines in absence
of treatment with or without serum was only minimal
(less than 5 to 10%). Since IGF-1 is one of the two major
growth factors in MM, we then tested the possibility that
IGF-1 might protect MM cells against ABT-737 induced
cell death. Cells were serum starved overnight and prestimulated with IGF-1 (200 ng/ml) before ABT-737 was
added. Addition of IGF-1 partially protected against ABT737 as evidenced by a significant increase in the number
of viable cells and decrease in apoptosis compared to
cells treated with ABT-737 alone for 48 hours (Figure 1
E-H). Together, these data show that IGF-1 exerts a partial
protective effect against ABT-737 induced MM cell death.

The IGF-1R inhibitor PPP potentiates the antimyeloma effect of ABT-737.
Next, we investigated if combined treatment with
ABT-737 and the IGF-1R inhibitor PPP has synergistic
anti-MM activity as compared to single agents. Based
on previous reports, RPMI-8226 and OPM-2 cells were
treated with a low, intermediate and high dose of either
one or both agents for 24 and 48 hours [10, 19, 24,
25]. In accordance with these reports, both compounds
alone reduced the number of viable cells in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Figure 2 A-D). Furthermore,
co-treatment of cells significantly decreased MM cell
viability as compared to single agent treated cells (Figure
2 A-D and Table 1). This was supported by combination
indexes (CI) calculated to be well below 1 for most
conditions, thus indicating synergistic anti-MM activity
(Table 1). In parallel, studies were performed using
primary MM samples from 9 MM patients (characteristics
and previous treatments summarized in Supplemental
Table 1). In accordance with earlier reports using primary

cells, responses to ABT-737 and PPP individually varied
between primary MM samples obtained from different
patients [10, 19]. The results show that irrespectively of
the molecular subtype or previous treatment, co-treatment
consistently resulted in enhanced cell death as compared
to treatment with PPP or ABT-737 alone (Figure 2 E-F).
In addition, for 7 out of 9 patients, we were also able to
calculate CI values and these were for most combinations
below 0.5 (data not shown). Together, these data
demonstrate that the IGF-1R inhibitor PPP and the BH3mimetic ABT-737 exert synergistic anti-MM activity.

significant increase in apoptosis as compared to either
agent alone and CI values were found to be considerably
lower than 1.0 (Figure 3 A-D and Table 1). Next, we also
evaluated the anti-MM effect of the novel Bcl-2 specific
ABT-analogue ABT-199 alone and in combination with
PPP. Although we observed some induction of apoptosis,
both OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cells were less sensitive to
ABT-199 than ABT-737 (Figure 3 E-F). Nevertheless, cotreatment also triggered a significant increase in apoptosis
as compared to PPP and ABT-199 alone. By western blot
analysis, we moreover found that co-exposure to PPP and
ABT-737 clearly enhanced cleavage of caspase-8, -9, -3
and PARP-1 (Figure 4 A-B) and decreased expression of
Mcl-1 and/or Bcl-2 (Figure 4 C-D) compared to either
compound alone. This shows that PPP potentiates both
ABT-737 and ABT-199 lethality by increasing the ABTanalogue mediated apoptosis.

PPP synergistically enhances ABT-737 and ABT199 mediated apoptosis.
We then examined the effect of the combination of
ABT-737 and PPP on MM cell apoptosis. In accordance
with the effect on viability, co-treatment triggered a

lesser extent as compared to control cells (Figure 5 E and
Supplemental Figure 1). However, once the concentration
of PPP was raised, silencing of Bcl-2 now completely
failed to protect the cells against the potentiation of ABT737 by PPP. In contrast, at both PPP concentrations,
silencing of Mcl-1 further increased apoptosis compared
to control cells. Together, PPP overcomes the dependency
of ABT-737 to Bcl-2, but fails to overcome the protective
effect of Mcl-1 in MM cells.

To investigate the contribution of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in
the synergistic anti-MM activity of PPP and ABT-737, we
either silenced Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 in the RPMI-8226 cells by
means of shRNA. First, the effect of shRNA on respective
protein expression was confirmed by western blot analysis
comparing cells transduced with a ShScrambled (control
cells) and a ShBcl-2 or ShMcl-1 lentiviral vector (Figure
5 A-B). Bcl-2 silencing abrogated the response to ABT737 (Figure 5 C). In contrast, Mcl-1 silencing resulted in
a significant increase in apoptosis in response to ABT737. In cells treated with PPP alone, both Mcl-1 and
Bcl-2 silencing sensitized the cells to PPP, indicating that
both anti-apoptotic proteins protect against PPP induced
apoptosis (Figure 5 D). Notably, when cells were coexposed to ABT-737 and a low concentration of PPP (125
nM, showing minimal toxicity alone), Bcl-2 silencing
still significantly attenuated apoptosis although to a

Since we observed synergistic anti-MM effects in

the combination in vivo using the 5T33MM murine model.
First, we confirmed the in vitro results using primary
murine 5T33MM cells. IGF-1 also partially protected the
5T33MM cells against ABT-737, while PPP synergistically
sensitized the cells (Supplemental Figure 2). In a first in
vivo experiment, mice were divided in 4 subgroups and

kg) and the combination of PPP and ABT-737 (Figure 6
A-B). Mice treated with PPP alone showed a strong and
significant reduction in BM plasmacytosis (51,4%) and
serum M-protein levels (90%) compared to the vehicle
group. In contrast, treatment with a suboptimal dose of
ABT-737 resulted only in a modest, though significant
reduction of tumor burden. However, although PPP was
administrated at an optimal instead of a suboptimal dose,
we still observed a significant further reduction in BM

plasmacytosis in co-treated mice compared to single agent
treated mice. In addition, as published earlier, PPP was
found to significantly and strongly inhibit angiogenesis
[18]. However, no additional effect was observed in
combination treated mice (data not shown). Next, to
study the effect on overall survival, a Kaplan-Meier
analysis was performed either in a prophylactic (Figure
6 C) or therapeutic setting (Figure 6 D). To be able to
observe any additional effect on survival compared to
PPP alone, the dose of PPP was lowered to 1.25 mg/kg.

In the prophylactic setting, 5T33MM mice treated with
vehicle had a median survival of 19 days, whereas mice
treated with PPP survived significantly longer, with a
median survival of 29 days (p<0.0001). Although ABT737 alone only prolonged the median survival of the mice
with one day (p<0.01), combination of ABT-737 and PPP
did significantly and strongly prolong the overall survival
compared to either agent alone (median survival of 56
days, p<0.0001). Similarly, in the therapeutic setting,
co-treatment of the mice was also found to significantly

prolong survival (Figure 6 D). Of note, although mice
were treated 6 times a week with ABT-737 and/or PPP
for 5 up to 8 weeks, we detected no significant weight
loss or major toxicity (data not shown). Finally, MM cells
isolated from the therapeutically treated mice were also
treated in vitro with different concentrations of ABT-737
or PPP to test for the possible development of acquired
drug resistance (Figure 6 E). MM cells isolated from
the different treatment groups were all found to respond
similar to ABT-737 (and even better to PPP) compared

may mediate resistance to proteasome inhibitors [26].
In agreement to this, we showed earlier that the CD1385T33MM subpopulation in mice is more resistant to antiMM agents, such as the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib
and MG132 [27]. Thus, we evaluated the effect of
ABT-737, PPP and the combination on the CD138- and
CD138+ MM subpopulations. 5T33MMvv cells were
sorted in CD138- and CD138+ MM subpopulations
and treated with different concentrations of ABT-737.
The CD138- population was more sensitive to ABT737 than the CD138+ population (Figure 7 A, D). In
addition, the CD138- population expressed higher levels

of Bcl-2 as compared to the CD138+ cells, whereas
Mcl-1 levels were similar (Figure 7 B-C). In contrast to
ABT-737, the CD138+ population was more sensitive
to PPP than the CD138- population (Figure 7 D). In the
combinations using 500 nM PPP, the CD138- population
was still found to be more sensitive than the CD138+
population. However, in the combinations using higher
concentrations of PPP both populations were targeted
equally. Consequently, these results suggest that ABT-737
either alone or in combination with PPP could be used to
target proteasome inhibitor resistant cells.

especially in combination with the histone deacetylase
inhibitor LBH589 [18, 35].
First, we demonstrated that soluble (growth)
factor(s) present in serum mediate resistance to ABT-737
and that this is partially IGF-1 mediated. These data are
in line with the study of Trudel et al. who reported that
growth factors and BMSC attenuate the anti-MM effect
of ABT-737 [25]. In addition, yet another independent
study suggested only very recently an important role
for IL-6 in the BMSC mediated resistance to ABT-737
[36]. Collectively, all these data demonstrate that MM
growth factors attenuate the anti-MM activity of the
ABT-analogous and provide the rational for combining
them with the IGF-1R inhibitor PPP. Here, we provide
evidence that PPP indeed synergistically sensitized HMCL
and murine 5T33MM cells to ABT-737 and ABT-199 by
further decreasing cell viability and enhancing caspasemediated apoptosis as compared to either agents alone.
In support of the data, it was recently communicated that
both the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK inhibitor
U0126 (targeting the two main signaling pathways
activated upon IGF-1 treatment) strongly sensitized the
HMCL KMS18 to ABT-737-induced apoptosis [36]. The
sensitization of MM cells to ABT-analogous by PPP was
furthermore confirmed using primary MM cells from 9
patients with very divergent characteristics and treatment
history (see Supplemental Table 1). In conjunction to
earlier reports on primary MM cells, a heterogeneous
response was seen with respect to ABT-737 sensitivity [10,
25]. Consistently, however, co-treatment enhanced cell
death irrespective of the molecular subtype or previous
treatment of the patients. For 7 out of 9 patients, we
moreover confirmed the synergistic interaction. For the
remaining 2 patients, we were unable to calculate the CI
values because of the limited number of cells obtained.
In hematological malignancies several compounds
have already been demonstrated to have the ability to
sensitize cancer cells to ABT-737-induced cell death
either through Mcl-1 down-regulation or up-regulation
of the endogenous Mcl-1 inhibitor Noxa [37-39]. In MM,
we have demonstrated that sorafenib may improve the
efficacy of ABT-737 in MM by reducing the expression
of Mcl-1 [40]. In addition, arsenic trioxide synergizes
with ABT-737 by inducing Noxa [41]. In agreement
with previous reports, we showed that silencing of Bcl2 strongly abrogated ABT-737 induced lethality, whereas
silencing of Mcl-1 instead sensitized the cells to ABT737 [10, 12, 24]. These data confirm that the ABT-737
(and -199) efficacy in MM depends on a high and low
expression of respectively Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. In addition,
we demonstrated that both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protect
against PPP. However, co-exposure to PPP and ABT737 overcame the Bcl-2 dependency of ABT-737, but
failed to completely overcome the protective effect of
Mcl-1. Based on recently communicated data that IL-6
treatment results in the phosphorylation of Bim at serine

DISCUSSION
Despite recent introduced new treatment strategies,
MM remains most often incurable. Like in most cancers,
elevated expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as
Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl causes resistance to spontaneous
or drug-induced apoptosis in MM [2, 4]. Different BH3mimetics, including ABT-737, were extensively tested
in (pre)clinical settings and their therapeutic potential
was suggested in several hematological malignancies [2,
4, 5, 28]. ABT-737 and its orally bioavailable analogue
ABT-263 are potent, selective small-molecule inhibitors
of Bcl-2/Bcl-Xl, but not Mcl-1 [29]. Only very recently,
a new orally available high-affinity Bcl-2 selective BH3
mimetic, namely ABT-199, was developed and was shown
to have a better toxicity profile, while being equally as
effective or even slightly superior in hematological
malignancies depending mainly on Bcl-2 (such as CLL
and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) [8, 9]. However, in contrast
to these malignancies, MM is mainly characterized by
the over-expression of Mcl-1 and thus Mcl-1 dependency
[30, 31]. Mcl-1 is located on chromosome 1q21 and gains
of 1q21 are unfavorable genetic prognostic factors for
MM patients [32, 33]. Consequently, ABT-737 and ABT199 are only highly effective in the CCND1 molecular
subgroup presenting a Bcl-2high/Mcl-1low profile, with
ABT-199 being slightly superior to ABT-737 [10-12].
However, for all the remaining MM subgroups this
superiority was less evident. In fact, an independent study
even suggested that both primary MM cells and HMCL
are less sensitive to ABT-199 than ABT-737, irrespective
of the Bcl-2 dependency or molecular subgroup [34]. This
is in line with our data showing that both RPMI-8226
and OPM-2 are less sensitive to ABT-199 than ABT-737.
Consequently, since the CCND1 group only represents a
small fraction of all MM cases, the ABT-analogous thus
hold little promise as single agents in MM. IL-6 and IGF1 are 2 major survival factors in MM known to regulate
expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [13-15, 17].
Thus, we hypothesized that IGF-1 might exert protective
effects against ABT-analogous and that the IGF-1R
inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP) might potentiate the
efficacy of this class of BH3 mimetics in MM. In the past,
we demonstrated that PPP is a promising anti-MM agent,

69 and subsequent increases binding of Bim to Mcl-1,
it is however still possible that PPP sensitizes MM cells
to ABT-737 by post-translational modification of Mcl-1
and/or Bim thus inhibiting protein-protein binding [42].
In addition, both in MM and Bcl-2 diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma ABT-737 was reported to induce autophagy
and this ABT-737-induced autophagy was cytoprotective
[43, 44]. Consequently, disruption of autophagy by
chloroquine sensitized cells to ABT-737 and this event
was accompanied with a clear increase in Bim expression
in MM. Since we earlier reported that Bim expression is
down-regulated by IGF-1 [13], it might be interesting to
investigate in the future whether PPP is able to inhibit
ABT-737 induced autophagy.
Finally, we also confirmed the enhanced anti-MM
activity in vivo using the 5T33MM model. Since MM
cells grow in a syngeneic BM microenvironment and
the model displays biological and clinical characteristics
similar to the human disease, this model is well suited
for evaluating the benefits of drug combinations in vivo
[21]. Here, when used at a suboptimal dose, ABT-737
alone had only minor anti-MM effects. In most xenograft
MM models, both ABT-737 and -263 were also reported
to fail as single agents in MM [45-47]. However, both in
a prophylactic and a therapeutic setting, we demonstrated
that co-treatment significantly decreased tumor burden and
prolonged overall survival of the mice compared to single
agent treatment. To test whether the therapeutically treated
mice developed acquired drug resistance, the in vitro
response of MM cells isolated from different treatment
groups was tested. We found no major differences in the
response of the MM cells to PPP nor ABT-737, indicating
that the treatment did not alter drug sensitivity.
Recently, the presence of immature CD138- MM
subpopulations within one patient was demonstrated and
these were shown to mediate resistance to proteasome
inhibitors [26]. Since we also demonstrated that
5T33MMvv CD138- (immature) and CD138+ (mature)
subpopulations display a different in vitro sensitivity
profile against a panel of drugs and both subpopulations
contribute to disease propagation [27], we finally
compared sensitivity of the two subpopulations to ABT737 alone and in combination with PPP. The immature
CD138- 5T33MM cells expressed higher Bcl-2 mRNA
levels and were more sensitive to ABT-737 compared to
the CD138+ subpopulation. In support of this, ABT-263
was also reported to selectively eradicate the quiescent
ROS-low subpopulation in leukemia [48]. In contrast,
PPP alone targeted the CD138+ cells more effectively.
After co-treatment, both populations were targeted
equally. Consequently, these data provide the rationale
to implement an ABT-analogue alone or in combination
with PPP in the treatment of MM after induction therapy
with proteasome inhibitors. In support of this, IGF-1 was
recently reported to contribute to acquired bortezomib
resistance and PPP was shown to overcome this [49].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion, combination of the IGF-1R inhibitor
PPP and an ABT-analogue has synergistic in vitro and
in vivo anti-MM activity. Combination of an IGF1R inhibitor (PPP) with an ABT-analogue might be a
promising new approach for the design of early phase
clinical trials to improve treatment of MM patients.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell lines
The human MM cell lines OPM-2 and RPMI-8226
(obtained at ATCC, Molsheim, France) were cultured
in RPMI-1640 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) medium
supplemented with 10% FCS (Biochrom AG, Berlin,
Germany), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM
L-glutamine (Lonza). The identity of the cell lines was
regularly checked by short-tandem repeat analysis. Cell
lines were regularly checked for infections.

5T33MM model
C57BL/KalwRij mice (Harlan, Horst, the
Netherlands) were housed and treated following
conditions approved by the ethical committee (License
no. LA1230281). The 5T33MM model originated
spontaneously in elderly C57BL/KalwRij mice and has
ever since been propagated by intravenous transfer of the
diseased marrow into young syngeneic mice [20]. For the
in vivo experiments, mice were intravenously inoculated
with 5x105 5T33MM cells. 5T33MMvv cells were
purified from diseased mice as previously described [20]
and were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza, Basel,
Switzerland) supplemented with 10% FCI (Fetal Clone I,
Hyclone, South Logan, UT, USA), 1% natriumpyruvate,
1% minimum essential medium, 100U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin and 2mM L-glutamine (all from Lonza).

Primary myeloma cells
BM samples were collected for routine diagnostic or
evaluation purposes after patients’ informed consent and in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All research
was approved by the local ethical committee (B.U.N.
143201316382). BM mononuclear cells were obtained
after Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Nycomed,
Lucron Bioproducts, Zurich, Switserland) and purified
using MACS Cell Separation MS Columns (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) and CD138
microbeads according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Purity of the samples was evaluated by flow cytometry
(FACS Canto, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, USA) and
analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).

APC. Finally, cells were resuspended in buffer, 7’AAD
was added and CD11b-/7’AAD-/anti-idiotype+ cells were
sorted into CD138- and CD138+ populations using a
FACSAriaI (BD Biosciences).

For in vitro studies, ABT-737 (Abbott Laboratories,
North Chicago, USA) and picropodophyllin (PPP,
Karolinska Institute, Sweden) were dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide. For in vivo use, ABT-737 was
dissolved in solvent containing 25% polyethyleenglycol,
65% of 5% dextrose and 10% Tween-80 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St.Louis, USA) and PPP was mixed in the food as
previously described [18]. The concentrations of the
solvents corresponding to the highest concentrations of
PPP and ABT-737 were lower than 5-10%.

Lentiviral vector production
The pLVH-CMV-eGFP-Scrambled construct was a
kind gift from S. Bonné (BENE, VUB, Belgium), while
the pLVH-CMV-eGFP-shBcl-2 and pLVH-CMV-eGFPshMcl-1 plasmids were obtained from T.J. Bos (HEIM,
VUB, Belgium) [13]. Lentiviral vector particles were
produced in 293T cells by transient cotransfection of the
transfer, envelope (pMD.G) and packaging (pCMVΔR8.9)
plasmid as previously described [22]. The vector stock
was collected 48 and 72 hours after transfection and
concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Titer was determined
by infection of 293T cells with serial dilutions of the
vector stock. Seventy-two hours after infection, the
number of eGFP-positive cells was determined by FACS.
For transduction, 5x105 RPMI-8226 cells were used. Two
weeks later, cells were eGFP-sorted using the FACSAria I.

Cell viability assay
Viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability assay (Promega, Fitchburg,
MI, USA). This assay measures ATP as an indicator
of the number of viable cells and is therefore a highly
sensitive method for assaying both cell proliferation
and cytotoxicity. The luminescent signal produced
is proportional to the number of viable cells present.
Briefly, CellTiter-Glo substrate was added and allowed
to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes after
which the bioluminescent signal was quantified with the
GloMax 96 plate luminometer (Promega). Experiments
were performed in triplicate.

Realtime RT-PCR
RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) and 1 µg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed using the Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative realtime RTPCR was performed in an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence
detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). The samples were amplified in 25 µl reactions
with gene specific primers for BCL-2 (forward: 5’
CTGGTTGAATGAGTCTGGGCTTTG 3’ and reverse:
5’ AGTGTTGGAGGTCTGGTGCT TAC 3’) and MCL1 (forward: 5’ GCGTGTTATGCTCCCAGTTCC 3’ and
reverse: 5’ TGCCAATCCAAGAATGCCAATCC 3’) and
Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo
Scientific). Primers were purchased at Integrated DNA
Technologies (Leuven, Belgium). The thermal cycling
conditions included 2 minutes at 50°C and 10 minutes
at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 0.15 minutes
and 60°C for 1 minute. The standard curve method was
used to quantify gene expression of BCL-2 and MCL-1
normalized to the endogenous reference gene GAPDH
(Taqman assay on demand from Applied Biosystems).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was determined by an AnnexinV/7’AAD
staining followed by flow cytometric analysis (FACS
Canto, BD Biosciences). Cells were washed twice
with cold PBS. Next, 100 µl AnnexinV binding buffer
was added together with 2 µl AnnexinV-FITC and 2 µl
7’AAD and incubated for 15 minutes in the dark at room
temperature.

Western blotting
Western blot was performed as described previously
[13]. All antibodies were purchased by Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, USA) except for Bcl-2 (sc-819)
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

anti-5T33MM-idiotype [21] and CD11b-FITC antibody
in buffer (PBS/ 2 mM EDTA/ 0,5 % BSA). Next, cells
were washed and incubated with rat-anti-mouse IgG1www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To assess the effect on tumor burden, mice were

of morbidity (paralysis of the hind legs), all mice were
sacrificed. Serum M-protein concentration was measured
by protein electrophoresis and BM plasmocytosis was
determined on May-Grünwald Giesma-stained cytosmears
of BM cells. For the survival study, mice received vehicle,
75 mg/kg ABT-737 (n=10; daily intraperitoneal injection),
1.25 mg/kg/day PPP (n=10), or a combination of both
(n=10). Treatment started 1 day (prophylactic setting) or
9 days (therapeutic setting) after inoculation. Each mouse
was sacrificed when it showed clear signs of morbidity.
