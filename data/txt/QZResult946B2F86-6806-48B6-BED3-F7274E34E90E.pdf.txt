ABSTRACT
Platinum-derived drugs such as cisplatin and carboplatin are among the most
commonly used cancer chemotherapy drugs, but very few specific molecular and
cellular markers predicting differential sensitivity to these agents in a given tumor
type have been clearly identified. Epigenetic gene silencing is increasingly being
recognized as a factor conferring distinct tumoral drug sensitivity, so we have used
a comprehensive DNA methylation microarray platform to interrogate the widely
characterized NCI60 panel of human cancer cell lines with respect to CpG methylation
status and cisplatin/carboplatin sensitivity. Using this approach, we have found
promoter CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of the putative DNA/
RNA helicase Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) to be associated with increased resistance to
platinum compounds. We have also experimentally validated these findings in vitro.
In this setting, we also identified the BRCA1 interacting DHX9 RNA helicase (also
known as RHA) as a protein partner for SLFN11, suggesting a mechanistic pathway for
the observed chemoresistance effect. Most importantly, we have been able to extend
these findings clinically, following the observation that those patients with ovarian
and non-small cell lung cancer carrying SLFN11 hypermethylation had a poor response
to both cisplatin and carboplatin treatments. Overall, these results identify SLFN11
epigenetic inactivation as a predictor of resistance to platinum drugs in human cancer.

colorectal, bladder and lung cancers [2]. In some cases,
such as in testicular cancer, they have even changed the
natural history of the disease [3]. Unfortunately, these
drugs have several side effects, such as renal impairment,
neurotoxicity and ototoxicity, which affect strongly the
quality of life of the patients [1, 4]. This fact highlights the
importance of discovering biological or cellular markers to
predict, within a given tumor, whether a patient’s disease

INTRODUCTION
Platinum-derived compounds, such as cisplatin
and its second-generation analogue carboplatin, are drugs
widely used to treat human malignancies [1]. Either alone
or in combination with other antitumor drugs, they have
shown to be useful treatments against a broad range of
solid cancers, including testicular, ovarian, head and neck,

will be sensitive or resistant to their antiproliferative
effect. However, despite the ubiquity of these agents,
we still lack of good biomarkers of platinum agents
response that allow us to avoid unnecessary side effects
on patients with a resistant malignance. Resistance to
platinum agents can be due to several mechanisms [5].
The major cytotoxic mode of action of this kind of drugs
is mediated by their interaction with DNA to form DNA
adducts which disrupt the structure of the DNA molecule
[1]. This alteration of the DNA leads to the activation of
DNA damage recognition and repair systems in order
to allow cell cycle progression. If the damage cannot be
repaired, cell death will be induced through the increase of
apoptotic signals [6]. Related to this, resistance to platinum
agents can emerge by increasing DNA repair activity or
by attenuating DNA damage-mediated apoptotic signals.
Thus, one aspect that has recently been garnering interest
is the existence of different “repertoires” of DNA repair
defects in each patient [7]. In this context, attention has
been drawn to BRCA1 for which, in addition to its genetic
alterations, the epigenetic inactivation of its expression had
been associated to an enhanced platinum response in breast
and ovarian tumors [8–10]. Epigenetic inactivation of gene
expression by CpG promoter island hypermethylation is
a common event in cancer cells [11]. The utility of CpG
promoter island hypermethylation events as biomarkers for
cancer progression or drugs response have already been
demonstrated in several studies [12, 13, 14]. Following
this lead, and as reported here, we have adopted a nonbiased global genomic approach to identify cancer-specific
epigenetic changes that could predict chemosensitivity to
platinum-based compounds.

These CpG sites were then analyzed along the NCI60
panel by examining the Pearson’s correlation coefficients
between their methylation values and the cisplatin and
carboplatin IC50 values obtained from the Developmental
Therapeutics Program of the NCI (http://dtp.nci.nih
.gov/). Through this analysis we obtained a total of 33
CpG sites which methylation correlated significantly for
both cisplatin and carboplatin IC50 values (Table 1). Most
importantly, we found the highest correlation between
methylation and cisplatin and carboplatin resistance in
several CpG sites located in the CpG promoter island
of Schlafen-11 (SLFN11). The correlation between
high SLFN methylation levels and increased resistance
to cisplatin and carboplatin was maintained even if we
excluded colorectal (all methylated) and leukemia/
CNS (mostly unmethylated) cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S1). Given these results, we decided to study the
methylation status of the whole CpG promoter island of
SLFN11 and its relation with cisplatin and carboplatin
IC50 values. SLFN11 presents a CpG island located around
its transcription start site what makes it a candidate gene
for hypermethylation-associated inactivation in human
cancer (Figure 1B). The DNA methylation microarray
approach in the NCI60 panel of cancer cell lines revealed
SLFN11 methylation (higher than 0.5) in 25% (15 of 59)
of cell lines, whereas for the remaining 75% (44 of 59) of
cell lines the 5′-end CpG island remained unmethylated
(lower than 0.5) (Figure 1B). All normal tissues analyzed
in our cohort (n = 64), counterparts of the NCI60 cancer
types, were found to be unmethylated at the SLFN11 CpG
island.
The classification of cell lines from NCI60
based on the average methylation value of all CpG
sites in SLFN11 CpG promoter island, corroborated
the previously obtained association between increased
chemoresistance to cisplatin and carboplatin (Figure
1C). Thus, SLFN11 promoter methylated cell lines group
showed cisplatin and carboplatin IC50 average values
significantly higher than the SLFN11 unmethylated cell
lines group. In addition, by using the available data of
SLFN11 gene expression [18], we found a significant
association between SLFN11 CpG island methylation
with diminished SLFN11 RNA levels (Figure 1D).
In this regard, the expression levels of SLFN11
correlate with cisplatin and carboplatin drug sensitivity
(18) and we have confirmed these data running the
CellMiner Analysis Tool (http://discovery.nci.nih.gov/
cellminer/) (Supplementary Figure S2). Importantly,
using a tridimentional dot-plot distribution, we found a
significant common correlation in the NCI-60 cell lines
between the three parameters: IC50 values for sensitivity
to platinum drugs, SLFN11 expression and SLFN11
promoter methylation (Supplementary Figure S2). Thus,
the candidate DNA methylation-associated silencing of
SLFN11 as a predictor of chemoresistance to platinum
agents in cancer became our main focus of interest.

RESULTS
DNA methylation analysis of NCI60 cell line
panel identifies SLFN11 CpG promoter island
hypermethylation as candidate biomarker of
cisplatin and carboplatin resistance
To achieve our particular goal, we have interrogated
a comprehensive DNA methylation microarray platform
[15] for the NCI60 cancer cell line panel in relation to
their validated cisplatin and carboplatin sensitivity data
[16, 17]. Overall, we analyzed 482,422 CpGs in the
60 cancer cell lines of the NCI60 panel (Figure 1A). The
complete DNA methylation data are freely available from
the GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc
.cgi?token=srydsegkptafnwj&acc=GSE66872)
and
NCI60 websites. In order to identify strong candidate
genes with differential methylation respect to their
cisplatin or carboplatin sensitivity, we imposed
stringent criteria and only considered those CpG sites
harbored in CpG islands located within ± 1,500 bp of
the transcription start site of the corresponding gene.

by western blot (Figure 2B) and immunofluorescence
(Figure 2C). By contrast, cancer cell lines unmethylated
at the SLFN11 promoter (U251, NCI-H23, DU145 and
SK-OV-3) expressed highly detectable SLFN11 RNA
transcript (Figure 2B) and protein levels (Figure 2B and
Figure 2C). We established a further link between SLFN11
CpG island hypermethylation and its gene silencing by
treating the HCT-15 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with a
DNA-demethylating agent. Treatment of these SLFN11
methylated cell lines with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine restored
SLFN11 expression at the RNA and protein levels (Figure
2D). These results were confirmed in the isogenic HCT-116
cell line, in which the two major DNA methyltransferases,
DNMT1 and DNMT3B, had been genetically disrupted
(DKO) [19]. We observed that the SLFN11 CpG island was
unmethylated in double knockout (DKO) cells and, most

Having observed the mentioned SLFN11 promoter
CpG island hypermethylation profiles, we assessed
in greater detail their association with the putative
transcriptional inactivation of the SLFN11 gene at the RNA
and protein levels. To this end, we first performed bisulfite
genomic sequencing of multiple clones in eight selected
cancer cell lines from different tissue types with different
cisplatin and carboplatin sensitivities that confirmed the
DNA methylation patterns obtained by the microarray
approach (Figure 2A). The cancer cell lines HCT-116, HCT15, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7, hypermethylated at the
SLFN11 CpG island, had minimal expression of the SLFN11
RNA transcript, as determined by quantitative reverse

importantly, that SLFN11 transcription was restored as
showed the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay
(Figure 2E). Western blot analysis confirmed the absence
of SLFN11 protein expression in HCT-116 cells and its
recovery in DKO cells (Figure 2E). Importantly, we found
that pre-treatment of the SLFN11 hypermethylated cell
line MDA-MB-231 with the inhibitor of DNA methylation
5-azacytidine followed by the addition of cisplatin or
carboplatin increased the sensitivity to these compounds
(Supplementary Figure S3). In a similar manner, DKO
cells (undergoing the described demethylation-associated
reactivation of SLFN11) were also more sensitive to
cisplatin or carboplatin than the parental HCT-116 cell line
(Supplementary Figure S3).

Conversely, upon efficient recovery of SLFN11 expression
by transfection of the full-length SLFN11 protein in the
hypermethylated and silenced HCT-15 and MCF7 cancer
cell lines, we observed a significant increase in the sensitivity
to cisplatin and carboplatin (Supplementary Figure S4).

SLFN11 co-immunoprecipites with the BRCA1interactor DHX9
Although some data have been reported about
the putative function of SLFN11 related with immune
system response [20], very little is known about the
role of SLFN11 in other contexts such as cell response
to platinum-induced DNA damage. To gain further
knowledge of SLFN11 activity, we searched for protein
partners of SLFN11 by combining immunoprecipitation
and mass spectrometry (MS). We compared SLFN11
immunoprecipitates obtained from NCI-H23 cells (SLFN11
unmethylated and expressing the gene) to SLFN11
shRNA-mediated donwregulation and in shRNA-scramble
cells (Figure 3A). We observed in the gel lanes of the
SLFN11 downregulated shRNA cells’ immunoprecipitates
that a particular band was significantly diminished relative
to the shRNA-scramble cells (Figure 3C). This band
was isolated for further characterization by MS. Mass
spectrometry (MS) analysis identified the isolated band
as the protein DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box helicase
9 (DHX9) with a Mascot Protein score of 83.9, thought
the identification of two peptides: DINTDFLLVVLR
(score 56.4) and GMTLVTPLQLLLFASK (score 61.4)
(Figure 3D). DHX9 is also known as RNA helicase A
(RHA) which has been related to DNA damage repair
and stability, and characterized as interactor of BRCA1
in this context [21, 22, 23]. Direct binding of SLFN11
to DHX9 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation
and western-blot using specific antibodies against
DHX9 and SLFN11 in NCI-H23, DU145 and U251

In vitro silencing of SLFN11 gene expression
increases resistance to cisplatin and carboplatin
treatments
Having shown the epigenetic silencing of SLFN11
gene expression by DNA methylation of its CpG promoter
island, we next sought to demonstrate that this SLFN11
epigenetic inactivation functionally contributed to platinum
resistance. With that end, we decided to downregulate the
expression of SLFN11 by the short hairpin RNA approach
in SLFN11-expressing and unmethylated SK-OV-3 and
NCI-H23 cells. These cell lines represent two tumor types
commonly treated with platinum-based chemotherapy,
ovarian and lung cancer, respectively. Two Sh- sequences
targeting different regions of SLFN11 RNA transcript were
use to assess the relation between SLFN11 silencing and
platinum resistance. For both shRNA against SLFN11 a
notable reduction on SLFN11 protein levels was observed
compare to shRNA-scramble cells (Figure 3A). IC50 values
to cisplatin and carboplatin treatment were then determined
for all constructions by MTT assay. Under this shRNAmediated downregulation of SLFN11 both cell lines showed
statistically significantly increased IC50 values for platinum

which are human malignancies in which platinum-derived
treatments are commonly used [1, 2]. The study of a first
clinical cohort of 41 cases of papillary serous ovarian
cancer (Table 2), all of whom were treated with cisplatin or
carboplatin, showed SLFN11 methylation in 39% (n = 16 of
41) of the patients analyzed by methylation-specific PCR.
Importantly, we observed that SLFN11 hypermethylation
was significantly associated with shorter overall survival
(OS) (log-rank test, P = 0.006; HR = 3.45; 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 1.35 – 8.80) (Figure 4A). For the 40 patients
for whom progression-free survival (PFS) information was
available, SLFN11 hypermethylation was also significantly
associated with shorter PFS (log-rank test, P = 0.003;
HR = 2.99; 95% CI = 1.40 – 6.40) (Figure 4A). According
to the Cox regression multivariate test, SLFN11 was an
independent prognostic factor of OS (log-rank test, P = 0.02;

to cisplatin and carboplatin, we wondered whether the same
effect could be observed in clinical samples. To address
this question, we studied two cohorts of patients with
primary ovarian and non-small cell lung tumors, both of

The Cox multivariate regression model showed that SLFN11
also was an independent prognostic factor of PFS (log-rank
test, P = 0.02; HR = 5.75; 95% CI = 1.37 – 24.2) (Figure 4D).
Thus, the clinical results resemble those derived from the
aforementioned cell cultures, which suggest increased
chemoresistance of SLFN11 hypermethylated tumors to
platinum-derived treatments.

HR = 2.91; 95% CI = 1.14 – 7.41) and PFS (log-rank test,
P = 0.005; HR = 3.35; 95% CI = 1.75 – 6.42) prognostic
factor (Figure 4B). A similar pattern was observed when
we studied a clinical cohort of non-small cell lung cancer
adenocarcinomas (n  = 22) who received platinumbased chemotherapy (Table 3). The presence of SLFN11
hypermethylation, detected by the DNA methylation
microarray method, was found in 13.6% (n = 3 of 22) of the
cases. Although OS information was not available for these
patients, we found that SLFN11 CpG island hypermethylation
was significantly associated with shorter PFS (log-rank test,
P = 0.031; HR = 4.05; 95% CI = 1.03 – 16.01) (Figure 4C).

DISCUSSION
Herein, we have analyzed the DNA methylome of
the well characterized cancer cell line panel NCI60 by

using the 450K microarray from illumina, and we have
related the obtained DNA methylation patterns with
the available data of cisplatin and carboplatin response
from the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the
NCI (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/). Using this approach we
have been able to identify SLFN11 CpG promoter island
hypermethylation as a predictive biomarker of platinum
resistance.
SLFN11 expression has been previously related
with cells sensitivity to several DNA damage drugs as
topotecan, cisplatin and irinotecan [18, 24, 25]. SLFN11
belongs to the Schlafen protein family, which has been
implicated in the regulation of important biological
functions, such as control of cell proliferation and
induction of immune responses [26], regulation of viral
replication [20], and, for cancer, in sensitizing cancer

cells to DNA damaging agents [18, 24, 25]. The SLNF11
C-terminal is constituted by a DNA/RNA helicase-like
motif that has not been functionally characterized yet.
This kind of motif has been described to participate in
essentials roles of the DNA damage cell response [27].
Previous proteomic studies pointed SLFN11 as a putative
interactor of several key proteins of the DNA damage
cell response system, such as replication proteins RPA1,
RPA2 and RPA3 or BRCA1-Associeted Ring Domain
protein (BARD1) [28, 29]. Herein, our mass spectrometry
and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that
the BRCA1-interactor DHX9 as a partner of SLFN11.
DHX9 is a member of the DEAH-containing family of
RNA helicases with an enzyme activity that catalyzes the
ATP-dependent unwinding of double-stranded RNA and
DNA-RNA complexes [30, 31]. Most importantly, DHX9

has been implicated in genome maintenance processes
[21, 22]. DHX9 has several interacting partners that are
directly involved in DNA repair, the most prominent
being the tumor suppressor BRCA1 [32]. Interestingly,
epigenetic defects in BRCA1 have been associated
with increased sensitivity to platinum-derived drugs in
human cancer [8–10], whilst an impairment of at least
one BRCA1-interactor protein (SRBC) has been related
to increased resistance to these compounds [13]. Thus,
it is reasonable to speculate that SLFN11 epigenetic
silencing compromises the correct partnership of DHX9
and BRCA1, and then it alters the correct function of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the DNA damage response system, causing a shift in
the platinum-associated chemosensitivity of the affected
cancer cells.
Finally, in our study we also show that this
epigenetic molecular alteration can be used as a response
predictive biomarker to platinum-based therapy in ovarian
and lung human cancer. Since all tumor samples in our
studies were collected before chemotherapy we presume
that the observed hypermethylation of SLFN11 in the
analyzed tumors confers a growth advantage in these cells
and it is also a biomarker of primary resistance to the
mentioned drugs. Future studies on tumor samples before

whether promote CpG island hypermethylation of
SLFN11 could be a subject of cellular selection generating
secondary resistance and, if so, whether it could be
used as a biomarker for the selection of the most useful
chemotherapy regimen.

removal, extension, bisulfite conversion G/T mismatch,
negative and non-polymorphic control probe intensities
were inspected as recommended by Illumina. Raw
fluorescence intensity values were normalized with
Illumina Genome Studio software (V2011.1) using
“control normalization” with background correction.
Normalized intensities were then used to calculate DNA
methylation levels (beta values). Likewise, data points
with statistically low power (as reported by detection
values of p > 0.01) were designated as NA and excluded
from the analysis. Genotyping probes present on the
chip as well as DNA methylation probes overlapping
with known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
were also removed. Probes were considered to be in a
promoter CpG island if they were located within a CpG
island (UCSC database) and less than 1,500 bp away
from a transcription start site.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human cancer cells and tissues
All cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines
were cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% (v/v)
carbon dioxide. HCT-116, HCT15, MCF-7, MDAMB-231 and 293T cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) while OVCAR-8,
H23, DU145 and U251 were cultured in Roswell Park
Memorial Institute medium (RPMI1640). The medium
was always supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal bovine
serum, 100U penicillin, and 100ug/L streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were authenticated by
STR profiling and tested for the absence of mycoplasma.
Primary ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer samples
were obtained from the Hospital de la Santa Ceu i Sant
Pau and the Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program
Biobanks. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) was determined by using Kaplan-Meier plots
and Log-Rank test. Statistical analysis was performed by
using SPSS for Windows and p-values under 0.05 were
considered statistic significant.

Bisulfite sequencing
Genomic DNA was converted using an EZ DNA
Methylation Gold kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA,
USA). A specific region of the promoter island was
amplified by PCR and cloned in competent bacteria. A
minimum of eight single clones were interrogated for each
sample and the methylation frequency was calculated in
each case.

Expression analysis
For qRT–PCR experiments, total RNA was
extracted using Trizol® reagent and retrotranscribed using
the ThermoScript™ RT–PCR System (Invitrogen). The
reaction was carried out following the methods for use
of SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems), and HPRT were
used as housekeeping gene to enable normalization.
Reactivation treatments with the demethylating agent
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA; Sigma) were performed at
1 μM for 72 h. For immunoblotting assays, total protein
was extracted using RIPA (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and EGTA, 1% NP40, 0.5% of sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% of SDS, and protease and phosphatase
inhibitors from Roche), and specific antibodies against
target proteins are listed in the enclosed table.

DNA methylation arrays
Whole-genome DNA methylation was analyzed
in the sixty cell lines of NCI60 panel using the
Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450Beadchips.
DNA was extracted from cell lines and tissues by
the phenol:chloroform method. All DNA samples
were assessed for integrity, quantity and purity by
electrophoresis in a 1.3% agarose gel, picogreen
quantification, and nanodrop measurement. All samples
were randomly distributed into 96-well plates. Bisulfite
conversion of 500 ng of genomic DNA was performed
using an EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. 200 ng of
bisulfite converted DNA were used for hybridization
on the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina).
Briefly, samples were whole-genome amplified followed
by enzymatic end-point fragmentation, precipitation
and resuspension. The resuspended samples were
hybridized onto the beadchip for 16 h at 48°C and
washed. Single nucleotide extension with labeled
dideoxy-nucleotides was performed and repeated
rounds of staining were carried out with a combination
of labeled antibodies differentiating between biotin and
DNP. DNP and biotin staining, hybridization, target

Short hairpin interference and ectopic
expression assays
Six different short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were
designed over the SLFN11 mRNA to target ovarian and
lung SLFN11-expressing cells. A shRNA against the
MSS2 yeast protein (not present in mammals) was used
as scrambled. All annealed shRNA oligos were ligated
into pLVX-shRNA2 plasmid, purchased from Clontech,
using BamH1 and EcoR1 restriction sites. 10 μg of each
shRNA-encoding plasmid were mixed with 7.5 μg of psPAX2 and 2.5 μg of PMD2.G plasmid in 1 ml JetPRIME

buffer and 50ul of JetPRIME (Polyplus-transfection
S.A., Illkirch, France). After 10 min of RT incubation,
the transfection mix was added drop-wise to a 10 cm
dish containing 10 ml of DMEM and 293T cells at 80%
confluence. After 48 h, viral supernatant was recovered,
0.45-μm filtered and added to six-well plates containing
the host cells at 80% confluence. After 48–72 h, cells were
checked for infection efficiency. For ectopic expression
assays, normal colon RNA was retrotrascribed and used
to amplify SLFN11 transcript. Specific adapter primers
were used to add restrition sites for NotI and XhoI to 5′
and 3′ ends of SLFN11 amplification. PCR product and
pcDNA4/TO expresion vector were digested with fast
digest XhoI and NotI restriction enzymes (New England)
and ligated by using T4 enzyme. Competent bacteria were
transformed with the pcDNA4/TO-SLFN11 vector, grown
and processed by maxiprep technique. SLFN11 total
sequence carried in the obtained vector was verified by
sequencing PCR. HCT-15 and MCF-7 cells in exponential
growth were electroporated to introduce pcDNA4/TO
empty vector or pcDNA4/TO carrying SLFN11 cds.

Mass spectrometry validation

Mass spectrometry analysis

Colocalization assay

1 mg of nuclear protein extract was recovered
in 1 ml of RIPA (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA and EGTA, 1% NP40, 0.5% of sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% of SDS, and protease and phosphatase
inhibitors from Roche) and putted on ice. After cleaning
the membrane residues, overnight pre-cleaning was done
with magnetic beads (Dynabeads® M-280 Sheep AntiMouse IgG, Invitrogen) at 4°C. 10 μg of anti-SLFN11
antibody from Santacruz (sc-374339) was incubated with
30 μl of magnetic beads overnight at 4°C in 500ul of PBS.
After that, beads were removed from the protein solution
and magnetic beads with antibody were recovered. Beads
were then cleaned three times with mild wash buffer (PBS
plus 0.1% of NP40). Target proteins were eluted using
Laemmli buffer at 90°C for 10 min and eluted proteins
were separated from beads. Samples were loaded and
run on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Bands were identified
staining the gel with silver overnight with Silver Quest
kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturers protocol.
Single bands were excised and sent to the proteomics
service of IDIBELL (Spain). Mass spectrometry was
performed in a NanoAcquity (Waters) HPLC coupled
to an LTQ OrbitrapVelos mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific). Data analysis was carried out in the LTQ
OrbitrapVelos. Peptide masses were measured in the
Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 (m/z: 300 - 1700). The
ten most abundant peptides (minimum intensity of 500
counts) were selected from each MS scan and fragmented
using CID (38% normalized collision energy) in the linear
ion trap with helium as the collision gas. All results were
filtered so only proteins identified with high confidence
peptides (FDR ≤ 0.01) and with at least two peptides were
included. Finally, results were filtered by Homo sapiens.

For colocalization analysis, the cells were
cultured directly on polilysinated coverslips and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Cells were
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes
and blocked with 2% blocking reagent (Roche) for one
hour. Immunistaining with SLFN11 (1:300) (sc-136890,
Santacruz) and RHA (1:500) (sc-137198, santacruz)
was performed for 16 h at 4°C. Anti-mouse Alexa488
was used as secondary antibody for RHA detection and
Anti-goat Alexa555 for detection of SLFN11. Multi-color
immunofluorescence images were capture and the images
obtained analyzed with the plugin Intensity Correlation
Analysis (Image J) to calculate the Manders´R overlap
colocalization coefficient.

For coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP), H23 wild type
cells were grown at 70% confluence. Nuclear extract was
prepared with RIPA. Samples were pre-cleared using
Dynabeads® M-280 Sheep Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen),
overnight at 4°C in rotation. Antibodies against SLFN11
(sc-374339, santacruz) and against RHA (sc-137198,
santacruz) were pre-incubated with beads for two hours at
4°C in rotation. Samples were cleared of beads, and beads
with the antibodies attached were recovered. Samples
were incubated with their respective antibodies at 4°C in
rotation for 2–4 h. After that, beads were washed three
times with mild wash buffer (PBS plus 0.1% of NP40).
Target proteins were then eluted using Laemmli buffer
at 90°C for 10 min and elution proteins were separated
from beads. To avoid cross-reactivity and unspecific band
detection, mouse TrueBlot HRP secondary antibody was
used. As a CoIP negative control we used normal mouse
Ig from Millipore (12–371) or Anti-Nucleolin (sc-8031,
Santacruz).

Cell viability assays
Cells were seeded in either 96-well microplates
at ~15% confluence in medium with 10% FBS and
penicillin/streptomycin. The optimal cell number for each
was determined to ensure that each one was in growth
phase at the end of the assay. After overnight incubation,
cells were treated with 5–8 concentrations of cisplatin
1mg/ml (Pfizer) or carboplatin 10mg/ml (Teva) and then
returned to the incubator for assay after 72 h. Cell viability
was determined by the 3-(4, 5-dimethy-2-thiazolyl)-2,
5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MTT
was added at final concentration of 0.1%. After 3 hours of
incubation (37°C; 5% carbon dioxide), the MTT metabolic
product formazan was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and absorbance was measured at 570nm. Prism
Software (La Jolla, CA) was used to calculate the drug
half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50).
