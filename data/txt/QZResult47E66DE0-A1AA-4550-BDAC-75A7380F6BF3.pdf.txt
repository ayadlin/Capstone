ABSTRACT
Background: Cell lines provide a powerful model to study cancer and here we
describe a new spontaneously immortalised epithelial ovarian cancer cell line (NUOC-1)
derived from the ascites collected at a time of primary debulking surgery for a mixed
endometrioid / clear cell / High Grade Serous (HGS) histology.
Results: This spontaneously immortalised cell line was found to maintain
morphology and epithelial markers throughout long-term culture. NUOC-1 cells grow
as an adherent monolayer with a doubling time of 58 hours. The cells are TP53
wildtype, positive for PTEN, HER2 and HER3 expression but negative for oestrogen,
progesterone and androgen receptor expression. NUOC-1 cells are competent in
homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, but base excision repair
defective. Karyotype analysis demonstrated a complex tetraploid karyotype. SNP array
analysis of parent and derived subpopulations (NUOC-1-A1 and NUOC-1-A2) cells
demonstrated heterogeneous cell populations with numerous copy number alterations
and a pro-amplification phenotype. The characteristics of this new cell line lends it to
be an excellent model for investigation of a number of the identified targets.
Materials and Methods: The cell line has been characterised for growth, drug
sensitivity, expression of common ovarian markers and mutations, clonogenic
potential and ability to form xenografts in SCID mice. Copy number changes and
clonal evolution were assessed by SNP arrays.

INTRODUCTION

overall survival of 30–39% [2]. It has long been recognised
by clinicians that ovarian cancer is a set of heterogeneous
diseases but, despite this, ovarian carcinoma continues to
be treated clinically as a single disease using a combination
of debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy.
The observed variation in the clinical behaviour of ovarian
cancer alongside the growing data reporting molecular
heterogeneity suggests that a heterogeneous in vitro model
for the study of ovarian cancer is long overdue.
Established cell lines provide an invaluable tool for
studying biological functions at the molecular and cellular

Epithelial ovarian cancer is often described as
the silent killer due to absence of symptoms and late
presentation. This combined with the lack of specific
sensitive markers and techniques for screening leads to
diagnosis at late disease stage in more than 70% of patients.
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynaecological
cancer mortality worldwide [1] and despite much research
into the treatment of ovarian cancer the overall mortality
has changed little over the past 20 years with a 5-year

level. Existing human ovarian cancer cell lines possess
the advantage of high proliferative capacity, clonogenicity
and extended life span in culture. However, ovarian cancer
cell lines have rarely been derived from chemotherapynaive patients, many were established following viral
transformation, such as with SV40 Large T antigen or
xenograft passaged in immunocompromised mice [3–6].
Very few cell lines are derived from mixed histology
tumours and with this type of tumour being less common,
reliable models for the study of mixed histology tumours
are needed. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest
that many cell lines contain significant misidentification,
duplication, and loss of integrity [7] making new well
characterised models desirable.
In this study, we describe a new ovarian cancer cell
line derived from ascites of a chemotherapy-naïve patient.
The molecular and growth characteristics of this cell line
present unique features, thereby providing the research
community with a new tool in the study of different
aspects of mixed histology ovarian cancer.

small bowel mesentery). Ascites was collected at the time
of surgery for culture. Final histology confirmed FIGO
Stage IIIc high grade mixed ovarian carcinoma of the
right ovary which was 80% endometrioid, 15% clear cell
and 5% high grade serous (HGS) carcinoma. Repeat CT
imaging demonstrated new liver and peritoneal metastases
and she died of progressive disease 52 days post-op after
only 1 cycle of carboplatin. She did not have any known
relevant familial history for cancer predisposition.
Bright light microscopy revealed a cobblestone
morphology characteristic of epithelial cells which was
maintained during repeated passage (Figure 1A). The
growth of NUOC-1 was initially slow with a 128 hour
doubling time, but with continued culture this stabilised
to 58 hours. NUOC-1 formed colonies when grown on
plastic at an efficiency of 2.2% +/− 0.6%. NUOC-1 cells
stained positive for proteins characteristic of epithelial
ovarian carcinoma (pancytokeritin, epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EpCAM), epithelial related antigen MOC31
and cancer antigen 125 (CA125)) and negative for germ
cell related antigen D240 and Vimentin (Figure 1B–1F).
NUOC-1 cells did not express oestrogen, progesterone
and androgen receptors (Figure 2A), but expressed the
receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3 (HER-3) receptor
and the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER-2)
receptor at a higher level than LNCAP and SKOV-3 cell
line controls (Figure 2A). Sequencing of the entire coding
region of BRCA1, BRCA2 and phosphatase and tensin
homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) revealed no
germline or somatic mutations. Furthermore PTEN protein
expression was confirmed by western blotting (Figure 2B).

P53 function assessment
Dysregulated tumour protein p53 is recognised as
a characteristic feature of HGS. To determine if the small
proportion of the HGS within NUOC-1 immortalised,
p53 status was determined. Sanger dideoxy sequencing
of TP53 Exons 3-9 detected no mutations. Consistently
with functional p53, treatment with Mouse double
minute 2 homolog (MDM2)-p53 antagonist (Nutlin-3)
demonstrated accumulation of MDM2 in NUOC-1 cells
concomitant with a dose dependent increase in p53 and
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) protein levels
(Figure 3A). In contrast, Nutlin-3 treatment of CP70 cells
did not significantly induce p53 or p21, consistent with the
established TP53 mutation in this cell line. Nutlin-3 had a
greater growth inhibitory effect in TP53 wild-type NUOC-1
cells compared to TP53 mutant CP70 cells (GI50 0.7 µM +/0.03 µM vs 23.5 µM +/−0.9 µM; p < 0.00001, Figure 3B).

deemed HR competent with a 2.84 fold rise in RAD51
foci, compared to untreated controls (Figure 4A). Non
homologous end joining (NHEJ) function is assessed by
the ability of cell extracts to rejoin incompatible vector
DNA ends correctly. NUOC-1 cells were found to be
NHEJ competent as evidenced by the ability to rejoin
both compatible and incompatible DNA breaks correctly
(Figure 4B). Excess production of 8-OHdG inferred
the non-functioning of base excision repair (BER) and
was quantified by competitive ELISA in NUOC-1 cells
(Figure  4C). AA8 (BER competent) with its derivative
EM9 cell lines (BER deficient due to XRCC1 mutation)
were used as positive and negative controls. NUOC-1 cell
8-OHdG level was 4.0 nM +/- 0.64 nM, indicating that
NUOC-1 cells were BER defective (Figure 4C). Massively
parallel sequencing identified heterozygous mutations in
OGG1, WRN, NBN and NEIL3, and homozygous mutation
were identified in ERCC5 (Figure 4D).

DNA repair assessment

Drug sensitivity assessment

DNA repair ability of NUOC-1 cells was assessed
by validated functional assays and sequencing of DNA
repair genes. A greater than two fold increase in γH2AX
and RAD51 foci formation following exposure to IR is
used as a cut off to define homologous recombination
(HR) competence and a < 2 fold increase in RAD51
is classed as HR deficient [8, 9]. NUOC-1 cells were

Sensitivity to common therapeutics was assessed
by SRB growth inhibition assays and compared to

Clonal evolution and copy number alterations
NUOC-1 cells revealed a complex, near-tetraploid
karyotype, with loss of chromosomes 3,6,11,16 and 19,
and structural abnormalities including rearrangements of
5q, 9q, 17p and 18q (Figure 5).
To assess clonal evolution two NUOC-1
subpopulations were derived. NUOC-1 cells were split

at passage 4 and either grown continuously to passage
14 (NUOC-1-A1) or frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen
for 12 months before being thawed and also grown to
passage 14. Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling of the
parental NUOC-1 cells and the two sub-clones show that
all three cell lines have identical profiles at 8 independent
STRs (Supplementary Table 1).
Intra-chromosomal copy number alterations
deviating from the baseline copy number state
(tetrapoloid) were identified in NUOC-1-A1,
NUOC-1-A2 and parental NUOC-1 cells using
OmniExpressExomeBeadChip genotyping data. NUOC1-A1 and NUOC-1-A2 carried numerous common copy
number alterations, consistent with a shared recent
ancestry (Supplementary Table 2). However, each cell
line also carried a small number of unique copy number

alterations not seen in the other cell line, indicating
ongoing genomic evolution. Greater than 95% of copy
number alterations were gains, with an average amplicon
size of 2.6 Mb and 1.2 Mb in NUOC-1-A1 and NUOC1-A2, respectively. The vast majority of copy number
alterations shared by NUOC-1-A1 and NUOC-1-A2
were also visible in parental NUOC-1 cells. With regard
to the unique copy number alterations, NUOC-1-A1
has a low level copy number gain affecting the long
arm and some of the short arm of chromosome 8 that is
not seen in NUOC-1-A2. However, NUOC-1-A2 has a
complex high level amplification on chromosome 8 that
captures the MYC locus (Figure 6), and which is present
in the dominant clone. Other genes implicated in type I
ovarian cancer pathogenesis are also affected by copy
number alterations in NUOC-1-A1 and/or NUOC-1-A2

(Figure 7A–7F). For example, the HINF1B and ERBB2
genes are captured by amplicons of 405Kb and 115Kb,
respectively, on chromosome 17 in both NUOC-1-A1
and NUOC-1-A2. Likewise, the AKT1 gene is captured
by a 155Kb amplicon on chromosome 14. The ARID1A
gene is captured by a large region of copy neutral loss of
heterozygosity on chromosome 1.

1-A2 closely relate to the findings from the SNP array.
Mostly copy number gains were detected in NUOC-1-A1
(98%), which would be seen as normal copy number in
the SNP array, in comparison to 100% MYC amplification
observed in NUOC-1-A2. Also, the results support the
hypothesis that NUOC-1-A2 forms the major clone, and
NUOC-1-A1 the minor clone, in the parental cell line.
No separation of MYC probes was seen in cells with
increased chromosome numbers, indicating that MYC
translocation was not present. In cells with amplification,
the signal patterns suggested the presence of one or more
homogeneously staining regions. In some cells isolated
amplification of the 5′ components of the MYC probe set
were seen suggesting the presence of varied size amplicons.

Assessment of MYC amplification
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MYC
copy number was carried out in samples at four stages of
cell line development (Figure 8). FFPE sections of tumour
identified a modal MYC signal pattern showing copy
number gain (3-6 copies) in 69%, c-MYC amplification
in 11% and diploid MYC signal in 20% of interphase
cells analysed. Ascites sample contained 14% diploid
MYC expressing cells. The majority of cells contain
MYC amplification (82%) with a small number showing
copy number gains (4%). This finding demonstrates
heterogeneity between ascites and solid tumour. The
differences of MYC between NUOC-1-A1 and NUOC-

Finally, we assessed the potential of in vivo
growth by injecting tumour cells at intraperitoneal or
subcutaneous sites in nude mice. No subcutaneous or
intraperitoneal tumours or ascites formation was observed
after 100 days (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

wildtype genotype of NUOC-1 is consistent with type
I ovarian cancers. Furthermore, other genes implicated
in type I ovarian cancer pathogenesis, namely PIK3CA,
HINF1B, ERBB2 (HER2), AKT1, PPM1D, and ARID1A,
are also affected by copy number alterations in NUOC-1.
Therefore, the NUOC-1 cell line is also representative of
endometrioid / clear cell ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore,
NUOC-1 represents a useful model for investigations of
PTEN function, DNA repair as well as hormone receptor
negative and tyrosine receptor positive phenotypes.
The results obtained from G-banding karyotype are
consistent with previously published karyotype studies on
epithelial ovarian cancer where high genomic instability
is observed [12]. The heterogeneity of cells observed
in NUOC-1 better reflects the heterogeneity of ovarian
cancer that many cell lines which were derived from a
single clonal population lack. SNP array results provide
further insight into the extensive genomic alterations
present in this cell line. Mixed histology tumours are
common in ovarian cancer. There remains a debate as to
whether these are monoclonal tumours with heterogeneous
morphology or truly mixed tumours. Most recent data
would tend to lean towards a monoclonal origin [13].
There is a significant difference in  the  genomic
pattern of the two NUOC-1 sub-cultures, and this is

Here we describe the establishment and
characterization of a novel ovarian cancer cell line
derived from a chemotherapy naïve patient. Extensive
characterisation to date and the unique features described
in this cell line make it a novel tool for ovarian cancer
research.
In order to establish new cellular models of ovarian
cancer, all samples of ovarian tissue were processed
to derive primary cell cultures as previously described
[10]. Primary ovarian cultures provide a model which
better represents the tremendous heterogeneity of
ovarian cancer, but which have a number of limitations.
Specifically, primary cultures have a very short life span
and slow growth, which limits characterisation as well
as their application in repeat experiments. Of the 156
primary cultures we have established so far, NUOC-1 is
the only culture to spontaneously immortalise. NUOC-1
cells continue to maintain their morphology and epithelial
marker expression over repeated passages.
NUOC-1 was derived from ascites of a mixed
histology tumour. TP53 mutations are reported in the
majority of HGS ovarian cancer [11], but are rare in
endometrioid / clear cells cancers. Therefore the TP53

different from the parental line. NUOC-1 cells are
susceptible to changes in copy number across the entire
genome, and most of these changes were gains rather
than losses. This instability could give rise to a very
heterogeneous tumour in many features, including basic
cell morphology and is perhaps more likely to develop into
a mixed morphology tumour. An alternative hypothesis
is that the tumour contains different pre-existing clones
which have grown into the two subcultures. Although
the two sub-lines differ from each other and also from
the parent population they share most of their features.
Despite several months in culture the two sub-clones
retain a genetic profile, in terms of both somatic copy
number alterations and microsatellite repeat length that is
very similar to the parental cell population from which
they were derived. The parental population was found to
be heterogeneous and continuous selection in different
flasks has led to the outgrowth of two different subclones, with the NUOC-1-A1 sub-clone being derived
from the major clone in the parent population. Although
the novel cell lines described here are clearly susceptible
to the acquisition of somatic copy number alterations, the
evidence suggests that the cells are sufficiently stable in
long-term culture to justify their use as an experimental
model.
NUOC-1 cells were not able to form xenografts in
mice which was consistent with the poor clonogenicity on
plastic and in soft agar. It has been previously suggested
that cell lines derived from patients with indolent disease
exhibit low tumourgenicity. This is not the case for the
NUOC-1 cell line, as the patient from which the cell line
originated had extremely aggressive disease and lived
only 52 days post optimal debulking surgery. Whilst the
inability of NUOC-1 cells to form xenografts limits its
use in xenograft models, this should not detract from the
unique phenotype of this cell line.

antibody, Invitrogen, USA), D2-40 (mouse monoclonal
anti-D2-40 antibody, Dako, Germany, and goat anti-mouse
Alexafluor® 596 secondary antibody, Invitrogen, USA)and
vimentin (rabbit monoclonal anti-vimentin antibody, clone
EPR3776, Abcam, USA, and Alexafluor® 488 goat antirabbit secondary antibody, Invitrogen, USA).

A routine sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
was used to assess cytotoxicity and cell growth as
previously described [18]. Briefly, cells were seeded
at a concentration of 1000 cells/well of a 96-well plate
and after adherence, treated with various concentrations
of inhibitors for 10 days before fixation, staining and
spectrophotometer assessment. Inhibitors used were
cisplatin, paclitaxel, camptothecin, doxorubicin, rucaparib
(donation from Clovis), Nutlin3 and irradiation (in house
D3300 X-ray system). For assessment of growth, cells
were fixed daily for 14 days and the doubling time was
calculated according to the slope of the linear portion of
the growth curve.

Homologous recombination assay
Cells were seeded onto glass cover slips and treated
with 2 Gy ionising radiation and rucaparib at 10 µM for
24 hours to induce DNA damage. All experiments were
performed alongside untreated controls with equivalent
0.1% DMSO. Cells were then fixed and rehydrated prior
to staining with 1:100 mouse monoclonal anti-γH2AX
(Upstate, Millipore Corp., USA) and 1:100 goat polyclonal
anti-Rad51 (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Inc., USA)
antibodies with appropriate secondary fluorochrome
conjugated antibodies, as previously described [8]. Image
J counting software [15, 16] was used to count γH2AX and
RAD51 nucleic foci. Cells were classed as homologous
recombination (HR) competent if there was more than a
2 fold increase in RAD51 foci, after DNA damage was
confirmed by a 2 fold increase in γH2AX.

Colony formation assays
50,000 cells/well were seeded in a 6 well plate for
24 hours. Cells were then incubated for 24 hours with
various concentrations of the cytotoxic agent before
reseeding at concentrations of 2,500, 5,000 and 10,000
cells for each drug treatment. Cells were incubated at
37°C for 30 days. The medium was aspirated, plates were
washed in PBS and then fixed using Carnoy’s fixative
(acetic acid: methanol 1:3 v/v) followed by staining with
1% crystal violet.

Non homologous end joining assay
Cell extracts were prepared as previously described
[17] using three T175 flasks for each lysate. Trypsinised
cells were homogenized in hypotonic buffer (final
volume 0.5 ml) and mixed with 0.5 vol of high salt
buffer. Ultracentrifugation (Beckman Optima TL120)
was performed for 56 min at 70000RPM at 4°C using
thick-walled polyallomer microfuge tubes in a Beckman
TLA120.2 rotor to provide a protein extract. Vectors,
which on digestion with BstXI yielded a 3.2 kb plasmid
and 1.2 kb λ fragment with either compatible or 2 bp
incompatible ends provided substrates and controls for
the NHEJ assay, were kindly donated by Dr Anne Kiltie
(Oxford, UK). DNA fragments were gel-purified using
spin columns (Qiagen, UK) and resuspended to 25 ng/μl.
End-joining reactions (20 μl) were carried out with 45 μg
protein extract and 50 ng DNA substrate in the presence of
50 mM HEPES pH 8.0; 40 mM KOAc; 0.5 mMMg(OAc)2;
1 mM ATP; 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 37°C for
2.5 hr. Samples were incubated with RNaseA (80 μg/ml)
for 10 min and then protein was removed by incubation
with proteinase K (2 mg/ml) and 0.5% (w/v) SDS for
10 min at 37°C followed by 10 min 55oC and 10 min
65°C incubation. Plasmid DNA was extracted with Trisbuffered phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Analysis of
plasmid end joining was performed by agarose (0.7%) gel
electrophoresis and GelRed (VWR) staining. Images were
collected and quantified using G-BOX.

In vivo growth in SCID mice
All animal studies were performed in compliance
with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act 1986 for the use of animals in scientific procedures
and have undergone local ethical review. Project licence
number PPL 60/42222. The tumorigenic potential of cell
line was assessed based on their ability to form tumours in
8–10 week old female nude SCID mice at subcutaneous
(s.c.) right gluteal or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection sites
(cells were first labelled by transfection with a luciferase
containing vector, which was kindly gifted by Dr A Elder
[Newcastle upon Tyne, UK]). Five mice were transplanted
with 5 × 106 cells suspended in 50% medium / 50% v/v
matrigel subcutaneously and five mice were transplanted
with luciferase-expressing 5 × 106 cells suspended in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for i.p. injections.
The animals were housed under sterile conditions in a
laminar flow environment with unrestricted access to food
and water. Tumour formation was assessed by observation
of subcutaneously implanted mice for 100 days. The five
i.p transplanted mice underwent non-invasive whole-body
imaging starting at 0, 10 and 30 days after implantation using
the IVIS Spectrum Imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences,
Hopkington, MA, USA). Mice were injected i.p. with 3 mg/
mouse D- luciferin (Promega) solution ten minutes before
being anaesthetized for the imaging procedure. Photon

and potential variants of interest (single nucleotide
polymorphisms with < 1% population prevalence) across
the target genes.

Western blotting

STR profiling

Cells were lysed using Merck phosphosafe buffer
(Calbiochem) and protein concentration was quantified
using a Pierce protein assay (ThermoScientific) as per
manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were denatured
at 100°C for 10 minutes before separation of protein
in the cytosolic extracts according to size using SDSPAGE gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred
electrophoretically from the gels onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (Hybond C Membrane (GE Healthcare).
Antibodies used for detection of protein were: Oestogen
receptor a 1:1000 (Santa Cruz 8005), Progesterone
receptor 1:1000 (Cell signalling), Androgen receptor
1:1000 (Santa Cruz 7305), HER-2 1:1000 (Santa Cruz
33684), HER-3 1:1000 (Santa Cruz 285), MDM2
3:1000 (Calbiochem), p53 2:1000 (Vector), p21 1:100
(Calbiochem), GAPDH 1:3000 (Santa Cruz) and Actin
1:1000 (Sigma).

STR profiling was perfomed by NewGene
Limited. Briefly eight short tandem repeat (STR) loci,
plus Amelogenin, were amplified using the GenePrint®
10 System, supplied by Promega. The reaction products
were processed using an Applied Biosystems® 3130 × l
Genetic Analyzer and the resulting data interpreted
using GeneMarker® v2.6.0 software (SoftGene LLC).
Appropriate positive and negative controls were included
in every batch of samples analysed.

SNP array copy number analysis
For SNP array analysis DNA was extracted using
a QIAmp DNA Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Intra-chromosomal copy number alterations
were determined using data derived from NUOC1-A1 and NUOC-1-A2 cell lines genotyped using the
OmniExpressExome BeadChip from Illumina (San Diego,
California). Copy number variation data was analysed
using cnvPartition v.3.2.0 in GenomeStudio V2011.1
(Illumina), with deviations from copy neutral called if
affecting 10 or more markers and achieving a confidence
threshold score of at least 50. Alterations affecting the
X chromosome and all 22 autosomal chromosomes
were characterised. Deviations from copy neutral called
by cnvPartition were confirmed manually (It should be
noted that copy neutral equates to a copy number of 4 for
NOUC-1, NUOC-1-A1 and NUOC-1-A2 because these
cell lines are predominantly tetraploid, as determined
by G-banding karyotyping (Figure 5)). A small number
of additional copy number alterations not identified by
cnvPartition were identified manually. Regions of copy
neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) exceeding 10 Mb
were also identified manually.
Parental NUOC-1 cells were also genotyped using
the OmniExpressExome BeadChip and the resulting data
visualised using GenomeStudio V2011.1. These data were
manually interrogated to confirm whether copy number
alterations and regions of copy neutral LOH identified
in NUO-C1-A1 and NUOC-1-A2 were also visible in
parental NUOC-1 cells. Regions of copy number alteration
and copy neutral LOH identified in NUOC-1-A1,
NUOC-1-A2 and parental NUOC-1 cells are detailed in
Supplementary Table 2.

Mutation analyses
TP53 mutations were detected by Sanger dideoxy
DNA sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was used to amplify exons 3–9 of the TP53 gene in
GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). PCR
was performed in a 25 μl volume containing 200 ng of
DNA; 1 × PCR Gold buffer (New England BioLabs);
2.5 nmol each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2; 15 pmol of each
primer (Sigma-Aldrich); and 1.25 U of Amplitaq Gold
(New England BioLabs). The PCR conditions were 5
min at 95°C, 40 cycles (30 s 94°C, 30 s 55–60°C, 30 s
72°C). PCR products were then purified according to
the manufacturer’s instructions using a PureLink PCR
Purification Kit (Invitrogen, Cat no: K3100-01/-02).
Mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis by DBS
Genomics (Durham University, UK). Sequencing results
were analysed using the SeqMan software package (DNA
star).

Next-generation sequencing
Genomic DNA extracted from cancer cells
cultured from NUOC-1 was sheared to a mean length
of 500 bp using nitrogen nebulisation. A custom-made
NimblegenSeqCap EZ library (Nimblegen, Madison, WI,
USA) was used to enrich for the sequence of interest.
This comprised the exonic regions of > 180 DNA repair
genes and limited intronic material. Captured sequence
was subjected to massively parallel next-generation DNA
sequencing by using the Roche 454 GS FLX platform
(454 Life Science, Branford, CT, USA). A bespoke
analysis pipeline was used to identify pathogenic changes

Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization for c-MYC
FISH analysis was performed by the Cancer
Cytogenetics department at Newcastle Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust, according to established protocols. The
Cytocell MYC ‘breakapart’ Probe set was hybridised to
nuclei as recommended by the suppliers. Slides were heated
to 72°C for 5 min and then incubated for 24  hr at 37°C
in a humidified hybridisation chamber (HYBrite; Abbott
Molecular). After hybridisation, slides were counterstained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories,
Peterborough, UK). FISH was scored with an Olympus
BX-61 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Southend-onSea, UK) with a × 100 oil objective. Images were analysed
using the CytoVision 7.2 SPOT counting system (Leica
Microsystems, Gateshead, UK). A minimum of 100 nuclei
were scored per test by two independent analysts.
