BACKGROUND. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II
antagonists, and the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphism all influence serum angiotensin II action. Because angiotensin II levels have been associated with cancer, the objective of the current epidemiologic study was to
investigate whether renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and/or ACE genotypes
were associated with an altered risk of colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate
cancer.

genotypes, and their interaction on cancer risk and progression was studied by
using Cox proportional hazard models.

RESULTS. Carriers of the high-activity genotype DD had an increased risk of
breast cancer compared with low-activity II/ID genotype carriers (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05–2.04), but no association was
demonstrated for other cancers. DD carriers who were exposed to long-term and
high-dose medication were at lower risk for cancer (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10–0.79).
Short-term, high-dose users were at risk for colorectal cancer progression in the
II/ID stratum (HR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.67–8.79).

CONCLUSIONS. Renin-angiotensin system-inhibiting drugs seemed to protect
against cancer in individuals with the DD genotype, which was associated with
high levels of ACE. Cancer 2008;112:748–57.  2008 American Cancer Society.

ngiotensin II is the biologically active peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is an important regulator of blood
pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis. Angiotensin II is also
involved in neovascularization, cell proliferation, inflammation,1–3
and cell adhesion.4 These properties suggest that it also may have a
role in cancer development and progression. Several studies have
revealed that expression levels of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1R) and
type 2 receptor (AT2R) are altered in human cancers,1 such as prostate cancer3 and breast cancer, and in precursor lesions for breast
cancer, such as ductal carcinoma in situ.5

The activity of the RAS depends on angiotensin
II action, which is regulated by angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE). Its activity can be blocked by
RAS inhibitors, the ACE inhibitors, and AT1R antagonists. These drugs are used for the treatment of
hypertension and heart failure and for the prevention
of nephropathy in diabetes mellitus. It is noteworthy
that RAS inhibitors caused reductions in growth and
angiogenesis in tumor cell lines.1–3,6,7
Two epidemiologic studies reported 20% to 30%
lower risks of cancer in users of ACE inhibitors than
in users of b-blockers.8,9 Another study reported a
significantly protective effect of ACE inhibitors for
breast and lung cancer.10 In contrast, several other
studies could not confirm those results.11–19 Two randomized clinical trials reported nonsignificantly
increased risks of malignancy for users of ACE inhibitors, but the follow-up of approximately 3 years
was limited.20 Currently, the association between RAS
inhibitors and cancer risk remains inconclusive.
Because it is suspected that these drugs affect cancer
progression,6,7 this process needs to be explored
separately.
In the ACE gene, which is located on chromosome 17q23, an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of 287 base pairs is identified in intron 16 that is
related to ACE plasma levels.21–23 Individuals who are
homozygous for the D allele have increased ACE
plasma levels, whereas individuals who are homozygous for the I allele have the lowest levels. Because
ACE plasma levels correlate with levels of angiotensin
II, it was hypothesized that the I/D polymorphism
may be important in cancer susceptibility. The DD
genotype has been associated with an altered risk of
breast cancer.24–27
We hypothesized that a protective effect of RAS
inhibitors, ie, ACE inhibitors or AT1R antagonists,
would be most prominent in DD carriers who had
the highest levels of angiotensin II. Therefore, the
objectives of this study were to investigate whether
the ACE genotype and drugs that inhibit the RAS system were associated with the occurrence of 1 of the
4 most common nonskin-related cancers (colorectal,
lung, breast, and prostate cancer) and whether there
was a drug-gene interaction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Data were obtained from the Rotterdam Study, a
population-based, prospective cohort study that
started with a baseline interview between July 1989
and July 1993. All inhabitants of the Rotterdam suburb Ommoord aged 55 years were invited. Of the

749

10,275 eligible individuals, 7983 (78%) agreed to participate. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center approved the study. The
rationale and design of the Rotterdam Study have
been described elsewhere.28
All participants were visited at home at the start
of the study for a standardized questionnaire in
which they were asked about their health state. Dietary data were collected from a special food questionnaire, as described previously.29 An examination
followed subsequently at the research center. Since
the start of the Rotterdam Study, cross-sectional surveys have been carried out periodically. In addition,
participants are monitored continuously for major
events, including cancers, which occur during followup, through automated linkage with files from general practitioners. Information on drug use is available for all participants since January 1, 1991.
Information on vital status is obtained regularly from
municipal health authorities in Rotterdam and from
the general practitioners who work in the study district Ommoord.

Cohort Definition
Participants who had a history of 1 of the 4 cancers
at baseline were excluded from the study (n 5 216).
For adequate exposure information, we ensured at
least 6 months of potential medication history by
excluding patients for whom follow-up ended before
July 1, 1991 (n 5 88). This resulted in a study cohort
of 7679 participants. Data on ACE genotype were
available for 6670 individuals. Follow-up was defined
as the period between baseline and a first diagnosis
of 1 of 4 cancers (colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancer), death, loss to follow-up, or the end of
the study period (October 2004), whichever came
first. To cope with the possibility of preclinical cancers at baseline, we also performed analyses in a
subcohort that excluded all individuals for whom follow-up ended before January 1, 1997. This subcohort
consisted of 6130 individuals with 5604 known genotypes.
Exposure Definition
Medication
Data on exposure to RAS inhibitors was gathered
from the 7 pharmacies serving the Ommoord area at
which almost all participants are registered. Complete information on filled prescriptions was available in automated form and included the product
name, the international nonproprietary name of the
drug, the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code,30
the total number of delivered units, the prescribed
number of units per day, the date of delivery, and

750

drug dosages. The duration of drug use in days was
calculated as the total number of delivered units divided by the prescribed daily number of units.
We defined several exposure categories. Any use
was defined as at least 1 prescription of an ACE inhibitor or AT1R antagonist during the study period.
Because cancer induction is a slow process, we
expected to observe differences in risk only after
intake of medication for long periods, for example, a
cumulative use of >2 years. Therefore, use of medication also was divided into 2 time windows: 1 day
through 2 years of cumulative use (short-term use)
and >2 years of cumulative use (long-term use). To
study the effect of dosage, we used the mean defined
daily dose (DDD), ie, the average dosage of a drug
taken by adults for the main indication according to
the World Health Organization.30

Genotyping
Blood samples were drawn, and serum was stored at
2808C. DNA was isolated from blood samples by
using a standard procedure (the salting-out
method).31 ACE genotypes were detected by using
the polymerase chain reaction technique according
to the method of Lindpainter et al.32 with some modifications. Details of the genotype procedure have
been described previously.23
Case Identification and Validation
Three different databases were used for case identification. First, cases diagnosed by general practitioners
in the research area were collected (International
Classification of Primary Care: colorectal cancer,
code D75; lung cancer, code R84; breast cancer, code
C50; and prostate cancer, code C61). Second, the
national registry of all hospital admissions was consulted to detect all malignancy-related hospital
admissions for study participants. Third, regional pathology databases were linked to the Rotterdam
Study to identify cases. Cases subsequently were validated by a physician (C.S.) on the basis of medical
records from the general practitioner, discharge letters, and pathology reports. The 10th edition of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) was
used to distinguish between the anatomic locations
colon, sigmoid, and rectal cancer (codes C18–C20)
and anal cancer (code C21). The ICD-10 also was
used for the distinction between mesothelioma (code
C45) and bronchus carcinoma (code C34) and to give
a second code for breast cancer (code X76) and prostate cancer (code Y77). Only pathologically confirmed cases were considered in the analyses. The
index date was defined as the earliest date found in
the pathology reports.

Covariates
The following covariates were considered as potential
confounders: age; sex; body mass index; total
cigarette pack-years; alcohol use (g/day); physical
activity; use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
salicylates, immunosuppressants, statins, and hormone-replacement therapy; age at onset of menarche
and menopause; number of children in women; atherosclerosis; diabetes mellitus; hypercholesterolaemia; vitamin intake and supplement use (total/
vitamin D/vitamin E); mineral intake and supplement use (total/calcium/selenium); total energy
intake (kcal/day); and intake of other dietary products (meat, fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat,
polyunsaturated fat, fibers, vegetables, fruits, eggs,
carbohydrates, carotenoids). To adjust for confounding by competing cardiovascular risks, we also studied the effects of hypertension and myocardial
infarction (prevalent and incident) as covariates in
the model.
Statistical Analysis
Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was calculated for the
ACE polymorphism with chi-square statistics. Cox
proportional hazard models were used to analyze the
association of RAS inhibitor use and cancer. In a first
model, we adjusted for age and sex. A second model
was adjusted for covariates that changed the point
estimate by >10% or for covariates that were independent risk factors of the outcome according to the
literature. Missing indicators were used to study the
effect of missing values. In an extra analysis, we
studied the role of competing risk from cardiovascular causes before developing cancer with a Cox proportional hazard model in which we used death as
an outcome and censored for incident cancers.
Time-dependent exposure to RAS inhibitors until
the index date were studied both as a dichotomized
variable (never/ever use) and in categories of cumulative duration (never use/1–730 days of use/>730
days of use). In this way, a cohort member can contribute person-time to >1 category of cumulative exposure. To study a dose-effect relation, each category
of cumulative duration also was dichotomized as 1
average DDD (low dose) and >1 average DDD (high
dose).
Furthermore, we studied the effects of the ACE I/
D polymorphism on cancer risk with an age- and
sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model. The II
genotype or the combination II/ID genotype was
used as reference category. A trend analysis was performed for the number of D alleles.
In addition, the association of cumulative drug
use and cancer was investigated in strata of ACE ge-

notype (II/ID and DD). Drug-gene interactions were
explored by including the multiplicative interaction
terms use/no use and DD carrier/non-DD carrier in
the model. Analyses were applied for all cancers together and for the 4 specific cancer types separately.
To exclude possible preclinical cancers at baseline,
all analyses were repeated in the subcohort of 6130
individuals who were eligible and free of a diagnosis
of cancer before January 1, 1997. This subcohort was
also used to investigate whether RAS inhibitors may
act as tumor promoters in individuals who started to
use these medications in the 5-year period preceding
the index date, at a time when the cancer is assumed
to be in a preclinical latent period. Because we
observed that mortality risk was associated with therapy and the number of D alleles,33 all analyses were
repeated with the exclusion of individuals who had
died before incident cancer occurred. P values less
than the conventional level of significance (P < .05)
were considered statistically significant. All statistical

analyses were performed with SPSS software (version
12.0.1; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
The mean follow-up in the study cohort was 9.6
years. During follow-up, a total of 730 patients
were diagnosed with incident cancers. RAS inhibitors were used by 157 patients (22%). The frequencies of the I/D genotypes of the ACE gene were in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi-square statistic,
0.070; P 5 .78). Individuals who carried the DD genotype were at increased risk for mortality compared with those who carried the II/ID genotype,
but this association was significant only in smokers
(sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04–1.49). Baseline
characteristics of the total study population are
presented in Table 1.

decreased slightly but nonsignificantly with longer

duration of medication use (Table 2). Similar results
were obtained in our subcohort of patients who had
6 years of medication history (data not shown). No
differences were observed for low-dose or high-dose
users.
We subsequently explored the association
between ACE gene polymorphism and cancer incidence (Table 3). The association between the number of D alleles and cancer was strongest for breast
cancer, although the difference was not significant
(Ptrend 5 .10). Carriers of the ID or DD genotypes did
not have an altered risk compared with II carriers.
However, DD carriers were at greater risk for breast
cancer compared with the combination of II and ID
carriers (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05–2.04).

A statistically significant interaction was observed
between the exposed individuals and DD genotype for
any cancer (P 5 .02), in that DD carriers had a significant decrease in their of cancer when they were
exposed to medication (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38–0.94).
Table 4 shows that this decrease was most pronounced
in long-term users (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.23–0.91). When
we subdivided the analysis for mean dosage, only
long-term use in high doses was associated significantly with a decreased risk of cancer (HR, 0.28; 95%
CI, 0.10–0.79). When we studied specific cancers in
this genotype stratum, any use of medication was
associated with a nonsignificantly lowered risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers; however, such an
association was not observed for lung cancer.

No substantial differences were observed in our
analysis with 6 years of medication history; however,
an additional significant estimate was observed in
II/ID carriers for colorectal cancer. We observed an
increased risk for short-term use of medication (HR,
2.36; 95% CI, 1.32–4.24); whereas, in the complete
analysis, the risk increase was only 51% (HR, 1.51;
95% CI, 0.90–2.54) (Table 4). The effect was greatest
in the high-dose category.
Finally, we investigated the effects of medication
use in the preclinical latent period (Table 5). For DD
carriers in this period, medication use was associated
with a lower risk of all cancers except lung cancer,
although these estimates were not statistically significant. For II/ID carriers, however, the risk of colorectal cancer was increased for any use (HR, 2.22; 95%
CI, 1.22–4.05) and especially for short-term use (HR,
2.73; 95% CI, 1.44–5.17). Stratification for dose indicated that short-term, high-dose users were at significantly greater risk (HR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.67–8.79);
whereas short-term, low-dose users were not (HR,
2.11; 95% CI, 0.88–5.04).
With the exclusion of incident deaths during follow-up, we obtained comparable results, except that
any use of RAS inhibitors in DD carriers lost its significant effect for total cancer risk (HR, 0.65; 95% CI,
0.41–1.03). Other estimates that were associated significantly with cancer remained.

DISCUSSION
In this prospective cohort study, we observed a dosedependent, protective association between RAS inhibitor use and cancer risk in individuals with the
ACE DD genotype. These effects remained after
excluding deaths during follow-up, indicating that
cancer risk was not influenced by early mortality for
RAS inhibitor users in the DD stratum. Furthermore,

we were able to investigate whether the ACE polymorphism influenced risk of colorectal cancer,
which, to our knowledge, was not investigated in earlier studies. We confirmed the previously reported
association between ACE polymorphism and breast
cancer risk.
In a previous study on our cohort, the DD genotype was associated with a significant 80% increased
risk for breast cancer compared with the II genotype.26 In contrast to this result, the current study
demonstrated a nonsignificant risk increase of 38%.
Adjustment for age at menopause and stratification
for hormone-replacement therapy did not alter our
results. Smoking did not show significant interaction.
The different estimates in the previous study may
have been caused by the inclusion of in situ carcinomas of the breast and a shorter follow-up (until February 2003). In the current study, 39 new incident
genotyped cancers were included compared with the
previous study. The higher risk of 47% observed for
breast cancer among DD carriers compared with the
combined II/ID carriers was in line with other
reports.24,25 One study demonstrated higher risk for
the low-activity genotypes II and ID, but the cohort
that was used was multiethnic and included more
premenopausal women.27
We confirmed that the ACE genotype was not
related to lung cancer34 There is one study that investigated prostate cancer progression and observed
more advanced tumors in DD carriers.35 No significant
relation was reported for ACE genotype and colorectal
cancer risk.
By stratifying for the ACE I/D polymorphism, we
observed that RAS inhibitors were associated with a
significantly reduced cancer risk in DD carriers.
These findings did not change after we excluded
individuals for whom follow-up ended before January

1, 1997. It is uncertain whether this risk reduction
resulted from modulation of cancer induction, before
development of the first tumor cell, or was because
of altered cancer development in the preclinical
latent period. Angiotensin II is able to influence cancer progression in the process of cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, inflammation,1 or cell adhesion,4 possibly by stimulating the AT1R receptor. After restricting
our analysis to exposure in the period 5 years before
diagnosis, the HR was unchanged but no longer was
significant, possibly because of the low number of

patients after restriction (Table 5). This suggests that
inclusion of both induction and latent period in the
risk window caused little misclassification and that
carriers of a DD genotype may benefit from lowering
the tissue availability of angiotensin II with RAS inhibitors during both periods.
In the low-activity genotypes II/ID we observed
that the higher risk for colorectal cancer in shortterm, high-dose medication users also was present
during the latent period before the diagnosis of cancer. Colorectal cancer cells predominantly express

the AT2R receptor type,36 which counteracts the
effects of the AT1R receptor by stimulating differentiation, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting cell proliferation.1,3,36 Here, angiotensin II potentially could
inhibit colorectal cancer growth and presentation,
which may explain the disadvantage of using RAS
inhibitors in individuals who already have physiologically low levels of ACE in the II/ID stratum. This
was true only for short-term users and was explained

by a rapid progression or presentation when tumor
cells are present in individuals who start using RAS
inhibitors. Long-term use did result in a slightly
increased risk. The effect of low levels of angiotensin
II on colorectal cancer cells needs to be tested in experimental settings.
Other epidemiologic studies have been performed to investigate the association between ACE
inhibitors or AT1R antagonists and cancer; however,

none of those studies took into account the ACE I/D
polymorphism. Like other studies, no associations
were observed for cancer,12,13,19 breast cancer11,14–16
or prostate cancer17,18 after adjusting for covariates
(Table 2). Older studies reported protective effects.8–10
When the ACE genotype was not taken into account,
RAS inhibitors did not demonstrate effects on cancer
risk.
Some potential limitations of this study must
be considered. Determination of the ACE I/D polymorphism was possible only in individuals who
donated blood at baseline. Even if these individuals
belonged relatively more often to a specific ACE genotype, it is unlikely that this would have jeopardized a valid estimation of the interaction between
genotype and RAS inhibitors. Moreover, selection
bias is unlikely, because the population was in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; and, of each genotype, sufficient numbers were included in the study.
Information bias in our analysis is also unlikely,
because data on drug use and outcome data were
gathered prospectively and without knowledge of
the research question. Absence of medication data
before January 1, 1991 may have led to misclassification of drug use, but it is expected to be independent of ACE genotype. Furthermore, this
misclassification of exposure was explored by
including an additional analysis that ensured 6
years of medication history. Estimates did not
change in these analyses, with the exception of the
risk for colorectal cancer in the low-activity genotype. Confounding is not likely, because we were
able to adjust for the main covariates that were
identified in the literature or that changed our estimate by >10%. Hypertension and myocardial infarction were included in the models for analyzing
competing risk. In our study, we had no information about the A-240T gene polymorphism, which
also is known to influence serum ACE activity.24,25
It might be interesting to include this polymorphism in future studies.
In conclusion, the use of RAS inhibitors was
associated with a decreased risk of cancer in individuals with the DD genotype, which is associated
with high levels of ACE. This effect was stronger for
long-term users of medication. Short-term medication use was associated with colorectal cancer in the
low-activity II/ID genotypes. Dose-effect relations
were observed for these associations. Although other
studies should confirm our results because of the
clinical impact of our findings, this epidemiologic
study supports a role for the RAS in cancer pathogenesis and suggests that RAS inhibitors can interfere
in that process.
