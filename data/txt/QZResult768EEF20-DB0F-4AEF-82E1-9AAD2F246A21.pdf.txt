Abstract:

Ischemia-reperfusion injury induces intense inflammatory response and tissue
damages resulting from the capacity of endogenous constituents called damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by damaged or necrotic cells,
to activate signaling pathways mediated by receptors of the innate immune
systems. Among them, two members of the Toll-like receptors (TLR) family, TLR2
and TLR4 have been shown to play key roles in the induction of inflammatory
response and cell apoptosis in a variety of ischemic tissues. The oxidative stress
injury caused by I/R injury has been attributed to the activation of MAP kinase
pathways, including those of ERK, JNK and p38. Here, we summarise recent
findings concerning the role of the protein phosphatase 5 involved in the selective
regulation of TLR2-mediated ERK1/2 signaling and the identification of the key
role of the non-phagocytic NADPH oxidase 4 producing reactive oxygen species
in the control of TLR4-mediated apoptosis in murine models of renal I/R injury
and in post-hypoxic kidney tubule cells. The identification of molecules signaling
involved in the ER stress-induced apoptotic signaling cascade may therefore
represent potential targets to prevent the induction of apoptosis in hypoxic tissues.

INTRODUCTION

cells, and renal tubule cells, or cardiomyocytes, exhibit
some, but not all, of the TLRs, primarily identified in
leukocytes [6-10]. In addition, epithelial cells stimulated
by TLR agonists or pathogens may develop potent TLRmediated inflammatory responses. These studies led to
the emerging concept that epithelial cell, together with
bone marrow-derived cells, are implicated in triggering
an innate immune response to bacterial infection and/or
ischemic stress [11,12].
TLR2 and TLR4 are constitutively expressed in
bone marrow-derived cells and in a number of mucosal
cells. A number of studies demonstrated that TLR4 play a
key role in the mucosal inflammation caused by ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) in hepatic I/R [6,13], intestinal I/R
[14,15], cardiac I/R [16], and hemorrhagic shock [17,18].
A number of studies have shown that liver, intestine or
kidneys from TLR4 deficient mice are better protected
than that of TLR4 expressing wild-type mice subjected to
liver, intestinal or renal I/R injury [6,15,19]. TLR2 have
also been reported to mediate inflammatory responses and
apoptosis during renal I/R injury [20].

Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a frequent
event encountered in many pathophysiological situations,
which results from complex interactions between reduced
blood flow, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and activation of inflammatory processes that promote
cell damage [1-3]. The initial sterile injury caused by
I/R induces the activation of an innate immune response
by pattern-recognition receptors. Among them, some
members of the evolutionarily conserved family of Tolllike receptor (TLR) family, which recognize distinct
microbial components and mediate innate immune
responses for host defense [4,5], also play key roles in
the initiation of inflammation and cell damages caused by
I/R injury [2]. The immune hematopoietic cells have been
considered to play predominant roles in the induction and
control of the innate immune response. However, there
is now growing lines of evidence that epithelial mucosal
cells, including hepatocytes, intestinal cells, pulmonary

HMGB1 in the activation of TLR-mediated inflammatory
reponse has been extensively studied in the context of
I/R. The release of HMGB1 from cultured hepatocytes
was shown to require intact TLR4, and be regulated by
reactive oxygen species (ROS). HMGB1 was also shown
to activate downstream calcium-dependent signaling
pathways, since inhibition of the calcium/calmodulindependent kinases (CMKs) reduces the release of HMGB1
induced by oxidative stress in cultured hepatocytes
[6]. Conversely, inhibition of HMGB1 activity with a
neutralising antibody markedly decreases the liver damage
caused by I/R, whereas administration of recombinant
HMGB1 worsened I/R-induced liver damages [6]. Similar
observation have been made in experimental models
of renal I/R: administration of blocking antibody to
HMGB1 reduces renal tubule apoptosis and inflammatory
responses caused by I/R, leading to the protection of renal
function [47,48]. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1)
has been shown to contribute to the hepatocellular relase
of HMGB1 by modulating the acetylation of HMGB1
through the nuclear histone acetyltransferase 330 [49].
Futhermore, the increase in the levels of acetyled HMGB1
is associated with concommitent decrease in nuclear
histone deacetylase activity 1 and 4 [50], suggesting
that the decrease in deacetylases 1 and 4 promotes the
hyperacetylation and subsequent release of HMGB1 in
hypoxic-stressed liver cells.
The signaling pathways activated downstream TLR2
and/or TLR4 which triggers pro-inflammatory responses
and apoptosis are however less well known. The oxidative
stress injury caused by I/R injury has been attributed to
the activation of MAP kinase pathways, including those
of ERK, JNK and p38 [50,51]. The activation of JNK/
p38, via the activation of the Ser/Thr MAP kinase kinase,
apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), plays a
key role in cytokine- and stress-induced apoptosis [5254]. The activation of ERK is thought to be involved
in cell survival, although its activation has also been
shown to be associated with drug-induced apoptosis [5557]. Immunoblot analysis of total and phosphorylated
ERK1/2, p38 and JNK MAP kinases in kidneys from
wild-type, Tlr2-/- mice and Tlr4-/- mice subjected to I/R
injury has revealed that I/R had almost no effect on p38
(not shown). I/R failed to activate JNK in both Tlr2-/mice and Tlr4-/- mice, but in sharp contrast, differentially
activated ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A), since I/R injury stimulated
the expression of phosphorylated (p-) ERK1/2 in postischemic WT and Tlr4-/- kidneys, but not in Tlr2-/- kidneys
[58]. IRI increased the expression level of TRAF2, and
p-ASK1 and p-JNK, and a to much lesser extent p-p38
(not shown) in day-1 post-ischemic wild-type kidneys, but
not in post-ischemic Tlr2-/- and Tlr4-/- kidneys (Fig. 1A).
In addition, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologue BAX (but
not Bcl-2) also significantly increased in wild-type, but
not in Tlr2-/- (not shown) and Tlr4-/-post-ischemic kidneys
(Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C provides a schematic representation of

Like other TLRS (except TLR3), TLR2 and TLR4
exhibiting the co-adaptor MAL (or TIRAP) interact with
adaptor myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). The
recruitment of MyD88 facilitates the association of the
Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain with IL-1-receptor-associated
kinases (IRAKs). Once phosphorylated, IRAKs become
dissociated, and interact with TNF receptor-associated
factor 6 (TRAF6) to activate TAK1, which then forms
a complex with TK1 protein binding proteins, leading
to the phosphorylation of the IκBs inhibitor proteins by
IκB kinases (IKKs), their dissociation and subsequent
degradation. This allows the transcription factor, NF-κB,
to translocate into the nucleus [21,22]. Activation of TAK1
also stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK), p38 MAP kinase, and c-jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) [23-25]. MyD88 deficient mice were also shown to
be better protected against renal I/R injury than wild-type
mice [26]. Concerning the kidney, experiments performed
on intact post-ichemic kidneys and primary cultures of
renal tubule epithelial cells (RTEC) also revealed that
TLR2 and TLR4 both drive the inflammatory response
and apoptosis [19,20], suggesting that TLR2 and TLR4
are activated by endogenous ligands released by damaged
cells to engage common or independent signaling
pathways.

ROLE
OF
DAMAGE-ASSOCIATED
MOLECULAR PATTERNS IN THE
ACTIVATION OF TLR SIGNALING
DURING I/R INJURY
The induction of non-bacterial, “sterile” inflammatory
responses occurring during I/R results from the capacity
of the so-called dammage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) to activate immune signaling pathways through
TLR2 and/or 4. DAMPs can be classified as endogenous
constituents released by damaged or necrotic cells, and as
components of the extracellular matrix that are released
by proteases [27]. A variety of DAMP constituents can
activate TLR signaling. They include the high-mobility
group box 1 (HMGB1) [28-30], heat shock proteins [3133], fibrinogen [34], fibronectin [35], surfactant [36],
β-defensin [37], uric acid [38], hyaluronan [39], and the
matrix components biglycan and heparan sulfate [40,41].
Most of them were shown to activate TLR2 and TLR4.
Genomic DNA from dying cells also induces the maturation
of antigen-presenting cells, and self-mRNA released from
necrotic cells activates TLR3 [42,43]. HMGB1, which is
ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells, is a member
of the non-histone, chromatin-associated, high-mobility
group (HMG) family of proteins [44]. HMGB1 is released
by all cells in a context of necrotic cell death [45], and
can also be secreted by macrophages or dendritic cells in
response to LPS, interferon-γ, and TNF-α [46]. The role of

the differential activation of TLR2- and TLR4-mediated
ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways activated during
I/R. As a result, the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic
cells was significanltly less in in post-ischemic Tlr2-/and Tlr4-/- kidneys than in wild-type kidneys (Fig. 1D)
[19,20,58]. Overall, these findings have demonstrated that
TLR2 selectively controls ERK1/2, and that both TLR2
and TLR4 mediates the activation of p-ASK1 and p-JNK,
two key signal events responsible for apoptosis during
IRI.
The following chapters will summarises the recent
findings concerning the mechanism governing the
selective activation TLR2-mediqted ERK1/2 signaling
and the mechanism controlling TLR4-mediated activation
of pro-apoptotic pathways in post-ischemic kineys and
primary cultures of renal tubule cells subjected to transient
hypoxia.

The activation of ERK has also been shown to be
implicated in cell survival following oxidant injury
or induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressinduced cell death signaling [59-61]. A variety of protein
phosphatases and protein kinases are involved in the
regulation of signaling pathways by a phosphorylation/
dephosphorylation mechanism [62]. The protein
phosphatase 5 (PP5), which is a member of the family of
serine/threonine phosphatases is ubiquitously expressed
in mammalian cells [63]. PP5 has been shown to act as a
negative regulator of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase
1 (ASK1)-JNK/p38 pathway that facilitates apoptosis
in hypoxic and H2O2 stressed cell [64,65]. PP5 has been
identified as an inactivator of the MEK-ERK pathway
through its interaction with the kinase Raf-1 initiating this
pathway [66]. PP5 physically was also shown to interact
with the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 which is complexed
with the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1),
a key regulatory protein involved in Hsp synthesis. This
complex present in unstressed cells dissociates in stressed
cells, and inhibition of complexed Hsp90 or dissociation

of the complex in condition of stress leads to an activation
of HSF1 [67-69]. We have shown that benzoquinone
ansamycin geldanamycin (GA), which binds to Hsp90
and destabilizes kinase complexes does not affect the
phosphorylation state of p-ERK1/2 in control or posthypoxic wild-type and Tlr4-/- renal tubule cells, but in
contrast, restores the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in posthypoxic Tlr2-/- renal tubule cells [58]. On the other hand,
GA had no effect on activated p-JNK in post-hypoxic
wild-type RTECs, and did not restore the activation of
phosphorylated JNK post-hypoxic Tlr2-/- RTECs as well
as in post-hypoxic Tlr4-/- RTECs [58]. These findings have
provided the first indication that gp96 play a key role in
the induction of the TLR2-mediated activation of ERK1/2
in post-hypoxic renal tubule cells.
gp96 (also called grp94), one of the most abundant
ER-residing Hsp proteins, homologue of cytosolic Hsp90,
plays a key role in TLR-mediated innate immunity [70,71].
Co-Immunoprecipiation studies revealed that gp96 coimmunoprecipaited with PP5 in renal tubule cells The
expression of gp96 increased significantly in renal tubule
cells subjected to hypoxia [58]. Interestingly, PP5 does no

longer physically interact with gp96 in post-hypoxic renal
cells derived from wild-type kidneys, while it remains
associated with gp96 in the protected, post-hypoxic
Tlr2-/- renal cells [58] (Fig. 2A and 2B), suggesting that
the disruption of the gp96-PP5 interaction leads to the
inactivation of PP5. We reported that knock-down the
gp96 protein by gp96 siRNA fully restored the activation
of p-ERK1/2, but not of p-ASK1 and p-JNK, in the posthypoxic Tlr2-/- renal tubule cells (Fig. 2C), indicating
that gp96 plays a key role in controlling TLR2-mediated
ERK activation in post-hypoxic renal tubule cells [58].
Furthermore, inhibition of PP5 by okadaic acid or silencing
Pp5 siRNA restores the activation of p-ERK1/2 in Tlr2-/renal cells [58]. In a similar way, extinction of PP5 by
Pp5 siRNA also reactivated ERK1/2 in post-hypoxic Tlr2/renal cells, indicating that the selective TLR2-dependent
activation of the ERK1/2 induced by hypoxia appears
highly dependent on Pp5 activity in renal tubule cells
[58]. PP5 associates with and inactivates ASK1 and JNK
under redox stress [64,65]. Consistantly, the expression
of p-JNK, as well as p-ASK1 dramatically increased in
okadaic acid-pretreated and in in Pp5 siRNA-transfected

not of JNK or ASK1 in Tlr2-/- deficient RTECs. Extinction of Pp5 mRNA expression also induces the reactivation of p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK.

gp91phox catalytic subunit of phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase
(NOX2), have been shown to be involved in cellular
functions related to innate immunity, signal transduction,
proliferation, and/or apoptosis [73]. Among the NOX
isoforms, NOX4 was shown to be required for LPSinduced H2O2 generation in TLR4-expressing HEK 293T
cells, and to interact directly with TLR4 in regulating
NF-κB activation [74]. NOX4, which is sthough to

the inhibition of p-p38 to reduce apoptosis induced by
hypoxia (Fig. 3D). Moreover, concomittent inhibition of
JNK and p38 had additive effects on apoptosis inhibition
(Fg. 3D), suggesting that both JNK, and to a lesser extend
p38, are involved in the induction of apoptotic signaling

isoform [78], similar to a the human NOX4 D variant
lacking exons 3-11 with a predicted molecular weight of
28-kDa [79]. We also showed that hypoxia stimulates the
expression of the 28 kDa isoform in wild-type renal tubule
cells (Fig. 3A) and that silencing both the full length 65kDa and 28-kDa Nox4 mRNAs or only the 28-kDa Nox4
mRNA isoform prevented both the induction of ROS in
post-hypoxic wild-type cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that
the 28-kDa NOX4 isoform play a role in the induction of
TLR4-mediated apoptosis caused by I/R injury.

CONCLUSIONS

INTERPLAYS BETWEEN TLR4, GP96,
AND
NOX4
IN
TLR4-MEDIATED
ACTIVATION
OF
PRO-APOPTOTIC
SIGNALING INDUCED BY HYPOXIA

Activation of both TLR2 and TLR4 signaling during
I/R injury induces potent inflammatory response and
induction of cell apoptosis. Studies on renal I/R injury have
revealed that TLR2 selectively stimulated the ERK1/2
through specific interactions between the ER-resident
gp96 chaperone and the protein phosphatase 5. Activation
of TLR4 signaling promotes the activation of the TRAF2/
ASK1/JNK pro-apoptotic pathway. In the kidney, the nonphagocytic NOX4 which physically interacts with NOX4
appears to play a key role in the induction of aptoptosis.
However, a number of question still remains to be solved.
There are multiple source of ROS production during
hypoxia, including the mitochondrial respiratory chain,
xanthine oxidase, xanthine-oxygenase, lipoxygenase,
and NOX enzymes in stressed cells [80]. Although the
28-kDa NOX4 isform appears to play a key role in the
control of apoptosis in post-hypoxic renal tubule cells, the
question arises wether this Nox4 isoform lacking most
transmembrane domains [79], is also directly involved
in the ROS production induced by hypoxia. NOX4 has
been shown to be involved in the up-regulation of the
hypoxia-induced transcription factor HIF-1α [81], a key
regulator of oxygen-regulated gene expression [82].
Conversely, the induction of NOX4 by HIF-1α also shown
to maintain sustain levels of ROS after hypoxia [83]. The
question arises to know as to whether NOX4 interacts
with TLR4 and whether NOX4 plays a role a in the
control of cell apoptosis in other tissue² than the kidney.
The identification of NOX4 as a sensor in the ER stressinduced, TLR4-mediated, pro-apoptotic signaling cascade
should has implications for selective anti-superoxidegenerating enzyme strategies intended to prevent the the
induction of apoptosis in hypoxic tissues.

Tlr4-/- post-ischemic kidneys and post-hypoxic renal
tubule cells exhibit significantly less active caspase-3
positive apoptotic cells and produce less ROS than in
the corresponding wild-type post-ischemic kidneys and
post-hypoxic renal tubule cells [19,78]. Like in TLR4transfected HEK 293 cells, TLR4 interacts NOX4 [79]
and with gp96 in non-hypoxic renal tubule cells, but TLR4
does not binds with gp96 and hypoxia did not alter the
physical interaction between TLR4 and NOX4 [78]. These
findings are summarized in Fig. 3C. However, silencing
gp96 mRNA expression prevented the increase in TRAF2,
p-ASK1 and p-JNK in post-hypoxic wild-type renal
tubule cells, a well as ROS production and induction of
apoptosis [78]. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments also
revealed that TRAF2, which is not associated with ASK1
in non-hypoxic renal tubule cells, co-immunoprecipitates
with ASK1 upon hypoxia [78]. These data have confirmed
that endogenous TLR4 binds with NOX4 in intact renal
tubule cells, and also provided strong evidence that the
ER-resident gp96 play a key role in the activation of
TRAF2-mediated signaling pathway downstream TLR4.
Silencing Traf2 mRNA expression almost fully impaired
the activation of NOX4, p-ASK1 and p-JNK and ROS
production in post-hypoxic wild-type renal tubule cells
[78]. Consistantly, the induction of apoptosis was no
longer detected in Traf2 siRNA-transfected WT renal
tubule cells subjected to hypoxia (Fig. 3D). Silencing
Nox428 siRNA expression does not prevent the activation
of TRAF2 in post-hypoxic, wild-type renal tubule cells,
but impairs the hypoxia-induced activation of p-ASK1
and p-JNK [78]. Silencing NOX4 RNAs encoding the the
full lengt 65 kDa or the 28 kDa isoform using specific
NOX465-28 and Nox428 siRNAs, respectively, also fully
impaired the induction of apoptosis and ROS production
in post-hypxic wWT renal tubule cells (Fig. 3D) [78].
Using JNK and p38 inhibitors, we also showed that JNK
can reciprocally regulate NOX4 and prevent the induction
of ROS production and cell apoptosis caused by hypoxia
