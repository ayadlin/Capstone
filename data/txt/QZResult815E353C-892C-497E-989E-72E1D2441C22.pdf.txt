Antiangiogenic Agents Can Increase Lymphocyte Infiltration
into Tumor and Enhance the Effectiveness of Adoptive
Immunotherapy of Cancer

Abstract
Adoptive cell transfer (ACT)–based immunotherapies can mediate objective cancer regression in animal
models and in up to 70% of patients with metastatic melanoma; however, it remains unclear whether the
tumor vasculature impedes the egress of tumor-specific T cells, thus hindering this immunotherapy. Disruption of the proangiogenic interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with its receptor (VEGFR-2)
has been reported to “normalize” tumor vasculature, enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents by
increasing their delivery to the tumor intersitium. We thus sought to determine whether disrupting VEGF/
VEGFR-2 signaling could enhance the effectiveness of ACT in a murine cancer model. The administration of
an antibody against mouse VEGF synergized with ACT to enhance inhibition of established, vascularized, B16
melanoma (P = 0.009) and improve survival (P = 0.003). Additive effects of an antibody against VEGFR-2 in
conjunction with ACT were seen in this model (P = 0.013). Anti-VEGF, but not anti–VEGFR-2, antibody significantly increased infiltration of transferred cells into the tumor. Thus, normalization of tumor vasculature
through disruption of the VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis can increase extravasation of adoptively transferred T cells into
the tumor and improve ACT-based immunotherapy. These studies provide a rationale for the exploration of
combining antiangiogenic agents with ACT for the treatment of patients with cancer. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6171–80.

Introduction
Cell transfer immunotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy
are two new biological approaches to the treatment of
cancer. The adoptive transfer of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or lymphocytes genetically engineered to express antitumor T-cell receptors (TCR) can
mediate the objective regression of cancer in up to 70%
of patients with metastatic melanoma (1–4) The integrity
of the tumor vasculature and the suppressive nature of the
tumor microenvironment can play an important role in
modulating the effectiveness of cell-based immunotherapies (5, 6), and antiangiogenic approaches can have a profound impact on both of these factors. Thus, in the
current study, we explored the interactions and possible
synergies between cell transfer and antiangiogenic therapies in a murine cancer model.

rectly suppressing various immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment (6). VEGF at concentrations similar
to those found in cancer patients can contribute to tumorassociated immune deficiency and has been reported to
negatively regulate antigen presentation by dendritic cells,
shift mature dendritic cell populations to immature dendritic cell precursors, induce apoptotic pathways in CD8+
T cells, and induce the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs;
refs. 6–12). VEGF can also alter the tumor endothelium,
which can further disrupt the infiltration and function of
tumor-infiltrating T cells (7).
Neutralizing antibodies against VEGF can block the immune-suppressive effect of tumor-derived supernatant on
the function of mature dendritic cells (12). The administration of anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab) to 16 patients
with colorectal cancer significantly decreased the number
of immature dendritic cells in peripheral blood (P = 0.012).
In mixed lymphocyte reaction assays, anti-VEGF antibody
could enhance the antigen-presenting capacity of dendritic
cells (13). Immunotherapy with granulocyte-macrophage
colony stimulating factor–secreting tumor cells in combination with VEGF inhibition enhanced the number of activated dendritic cells and tumor-infiltrating effector T
cells and reduced the number of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (14). Other antiangiogenic agents have
been shown to inhibit tumor growth and microvessel density, and enhance the infiltration of leukocytes and CD8+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes into tumor (15).

Antiangiogenic agents have been used as a monotherapy
or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in both
animal models and in humans, with variable results. Mouse
anti-VEGF antibody, A4.6.1, was shown to suppress the growth
of human rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma, leiomyosarcoma, and various other tumors implanted in immunodeficient
mice (16, 17). Other antiangiogenic agents targeting VEGFRs
and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors have also been
used effectively for tumor treatment in several preclinical
and clinical models (18, 19). Anti-mouse VEGFR-2 antibody
(DC101) treatment significantly suppressed the growth of
primary murine Lewis lung, 4T1 mammary, and B16 melanoma tumors, and completely inhibited the growth of established epidermoid, glioblastoma, pancreatic, and renal
human tumor xenografts (18). Monotherapy with anti-VEGF
alone has not been successful in human clinical trials but
when used in combination with chemotherapy have increased overall survival and/or progression-free survival in
colorectal, breast, and lung cancer patients (19, 20). VEGF receptor kinase–selective multitargeted agents in combination
with various chemotherapeutic agents are in different stages
of clinical development (19, 20).
Inhibition of the VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis has been reported to
normalize tumor vasculature, decrease interstitial fluid pressure, enhance oncotic pressure gradient, decrease hydrostatic pressure gradient across the tumor vasculature (21), and
increase deeper penetration of high molecular weight tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)–labeled bovine
serum albumin (BSA; ref. 22). Based on the above observations, it has been postulated that judicious application of
antiangiogenic agents can “normalize” the abnormal tumor
vasculature, resulting in more efficient delivery of drugs
and oxygen to targeted cancer cells (23).
The current study was thus proposed to test whether the
addition of antiangiogenic agents could significantly enhance
the antitumor therapeutic effect of cell transfer therapy. We
tested this hypothesis in the pmel-1 TCR transgenic mouse
model previously reported by our group (24), which models
the use of adoptive cell therapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in the clinical setting.

Splenocytes were further cultured in complete medium
(RPMI 1640, 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino
acids, L-glutamine, and 2-mercaptoethanol) in the presence
of 1 μmol/L hgp25-33 peptide and 30 IU/mL of rhIL-2 (Novartis Corp.; refs. 24, 25). On the day of ACT (day 0, D0),
all tumor-bearing recipient mice received 500 cGy of sublethal radiation as a lymphodepleting regimen before cell
transfer. In vitro activated pmel-1-Ly5.1 T cells (P; 1 × 106) were
transferred intravenously along with the injection of 2 × 107
plaque-forming units of recombinant vaccinia virus (V) expressing hgp100. All treated mice received an intraperitoneal
injection of 600,000 IU of rhIL-2 twice daily for a total of six
doses. In this article, groups of mice receiving all three of
pmel-1-Ly5.1 cells (P), vaccine (V), and rhIL-2 (I) are referred
to as the PVI group.

Materials and Methods

Enumeration and flow ctyometric analysis of adoptively
transferred tumor-infiltrating pmel-1-Ly5.1 cells
For the studies of cell infiltration into the tumor, experimental groups received a single dose of antibody 2 days before (−D2) cell transfer (D0). Mice were euthanized on days 3,
4, 5, and 6 post cell transfers to collect spleen and tumor.
Splenocytes were prepared as described above while total tumor cells were harvested by homogenizing the tumor into a
single-cell suspension using the rubber end of a 3-cm3 syringe and a 40-μm filter cup. TILs were enriched by density
gradient centrifugation (15,000 × g/20 min); counted by trypan blue exclusion; and analyzed by flow cytometry for the
expression of CD3, Ly5.1, and Vβ13. Dead cells were excluded
using propidium iodide (PI). We calculated the absolute
number of pmel-1-Ly5.1 cells by multiplying the live cell
count by the percentage of Ly5.1+PI− cells. Error bars represent the SEM, with four to five mice in each group.

Mice and cell lines
Pmel-1 TCR transgenic (24, 25) and C57BL/6 mice (The
Jackson Laboratory) were bred, housed, and used according
to the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute Animal Care
and Use Committee. The Vβ-13-pmel-1 TCR recognizes an
epitope of the gp100 melanoma/melanocyte differentiation
antigen present on the B16 melanoma, a spontaneous murine
melanoma in C57BL/6 mice obtained from the National Cancer Institute tumor repository and maintained in culture (24).
In vitro pmel-1 T-cell activation and adoptive
cell transfer
Seven days before adoptive cell transfer (ACT), splenocytes
from pmel-1 TCR transgenic mice were harvested, and depleted of erythrocytes by using ACK lysis buffer (GIBCO).

Antibody administration and in vivo tumor treatment
Anti-mouse VEGF antibody (B20-4.1.1-PHAGE, α-VEGF)
was kindly supplied by Genentech, and rat anti-mouse
VEGFR-2 (DC101) was kindly supplied by ImClone Systems.
For tumor treatment experiments, antibodies were injected
starting on the day of cell transfer (D0) and continued at
an interval of 3 days. Rat serum IgG (Sigma) at an equivalent
concentration was used as an isotope control (see figure and
figure legends for antibody schedule and number of doses).
C57BL/6 female recipient mice (6–12 weeks of age) were
injected subcutaneously with 5 × 105 B16 melanoma cells,
and tumors were allowed to grow for 12 to 18 days (n = 5
mice per group in all tumor treatment experiments). On
the day of cell transfer, experimental groups received either
pmel-1-Ly5.1 T cells (P), vaccine (V), IL-2 (I), rat IgG, α-VEGF,
or DC101 alone or in various combinations (see figure and
figure legends for more details). Tumors were measured using calipers, and the products of the perpendicular diameters
were recorded. All experiments were done in a blinded fashion (experimental mouse groups were coded so the investigators measuring the tumor and analyzing the data had no
knowledge of the identity of the treatment groups). Error
bars represent SEM.

Adoptive Cell Therapy and Antiangiogenesis

Measurement of mean tumor vessel area by CD31
immunofluorescence
B16 tumors were collected at various time points from experimental groups (two to five mice) receiving a single dose of
rat IgG, DC101, or α-VEGF alone and frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium. Frozen sections were dried
overnight after acetone treatment, washed with PBS, blocked
with 10% normal goat serum, and stained with anti-CD31 antibody in 2.5% normal goat serum. After overnight incubation,
sections were washed, treated with secondary goat anti-rat
Cy5 antibody in 2.5% normal goat serum, and further treated
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole–containing medium.
Tumor sections were scanned to identify areas of maximal
vascular density, and five different images were obtained per
tumor on a LSM 510 microscope. Zeiss LSM Image Software
was used to exclude background fluorescence and to quantify the image area occupied by the Cy5 fluorescence marker.
The vascular area is reported as the mean area of Cy5 fluorescence of the five images.
Statistical analyses
We compared tumor growth slopes using the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test, and the single-measurement comparisons
between two groups were tested using unpaired t tests.
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival, and
the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used for comparison
between the two groups.

Results
Administration of anti-VEGF antibody enhances
the antitumor efficacy of cell transfer therapy and
is dependent on prior lymphodepleting total
body irradiation
In multiple preliminary experiments, administration of
anti-VEGF antibody transiently inhibited growth of subcutaneous B16 melanomas that were ∼50 mm2, but had little or
no antitumor activity on tumors that were >100 mm2. An example of the efficacy of anti-VEGF antibody alone to treat
50 and 200 mm2 tumors in the same experiment is shown
in Fig. 1A and B. Significant (P = 0.009) antitumor activity
of anti-VEGF antibody was seen on small tumors (≥50
mm 2 ) whereas lesser impact was seen on large tumors
(∼200 mm2; see also Fig. 2). Prior published experiments
showed that effective ACT of established B16 melanoma (irrespective of tumor size) required the administration of antiGP100 transgenic pmel-1 T cells plus gp100 vaccine plus IL-2
administration after 5 cGy lymphodepleting total body irradiation (24, 25), referred to here as the PVI treatment. When
small (∼50 mm2) tumors were treated with anti-VEGF antibody, a profound antitumor effect was seen; when anti-VEGF
antibody was added to PVI, there was little to no additive
antitumor impact (Fig. 1C and D). To better mimic the treatment of human tumors, all subsequent experiments testing
the impact of combined treatment with this antibody plus
ACT used mice bearing tumors >100 mm2.
To determine whether the addition of α-VEGF had any additive or synergistic impact on the therapeutic effect of ACT

www.aacrjournals.org

in treating large established B16 tumors, we treated recipient
mice with multiple doses of 100 or 200 μg of α-VEGF along
with ACT immunotherapy. Two representative experiments
combining ACT with the administration of anti-VEGF antibody are shown in Fig. 2. Increasing doses (four, six, and
eight) of 100 μg/dose α-VEGF alone did not have an antitumor effect on large established B16 tumors nor did it prolong
the survival of these mice when compared with the rat IgG
control group (100 μg/dose, eight doses). ACT with PVI alone
exhibited significant antitumor activity and prolonged survival of mice (solid circles, Fig. 2A and B). Four doses of
α-VEGF had little effect when added to ACT, whereas six
and eight doses of anti-VEGF showed significant (P =
0.009) synergistic antitumor effects when added to ACT
(Fig. 2A and B). In repeat experiments, eight doses of α-VEGF
consistently enhanced the antitumor effect of ACT, whereas
lower dose numbers had a more variable impact.
We also investigated whether a prior lymphodepleting regimen was required for effective ACT when used in combination with α-VEGF (Fig. 2C and D). Eight doses of 100 μg/dose
α-VEGF alone did not have any antitumor effect on large B16
tumors when used in the presence or absence of 500 cGy radiation compared with corresponding rat IgG controls
(Fig. 2C and D). ACT immunotherapy of large established
B16 tumors using PVI in the absence of prior radiation failed
to exhibit any antitumor effect when used with or without
α-VEGF (Fig. 2C). Concordant with our previous reports,
host lymphodepletion by total body irradiation (500 cGy) significantly enhanced the antitumor effect of PVI. The addition
of α-VEGF to the PVI group receiving 500 cGy total body irradiation further enhanced the antitumor effect (P = 0.01)
and prolonged the survival of mice (P = 0.027; Fig. 2C and
D). Thus, host lymphodepleting conditioning before ACT is
essential to achieve maximum antitumor activity and was
further enhanced by the addition of α-VEGF. Hence, in all
our further experiments, we included 500 cGy of radiation
as a host lymphodepleting regimen before ACT.
Anti-VEGF treatment enhances the infiltration of
pmel-1 T cells into B16 tumors
A single dose of antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab in
humans and DC101 in mice) has been reported to lead to
vascular normalization in tumors (21, 22). Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with DC101 resulted in a significantly deeper penetration of TRITC-labeled BSA molecules into the
tumor (22). We thus sought to determine whether the antitumor therapeutic effect of the combination therapy of ACT
plus anti-VEGF was associated with an enhanced pmel-1
T-cell infiltration into the B16 tumor. Ly5.1 pmel-1 T cells
were infused into Ly5.2 mice to distinguish transferred from
endogenous cells. A single dose of α-VEGF (100, 200, or
500 μg) given 2 days before ACT lead to significantly enhanced infiltration of pmel-1-Ly5.1 cells into tumors. In 12
consecutive experimental determinations of cells infiltrating
into tumors on days 4 to 6 after cell transfer, in mice receiving anti-VEGF antibody 2 days before ACT, there were 32.1 ±
6.8% (mean ± SEM) Ly5.1 pmel-1 tumor-infiltrating T cells
compared with 14.8 ± 5.7% Ly5.1 pmel T cells in mice

receiving control rat IgG (p2 = 0.0051, paired t test). In 10 consecutive experimental determinations, the number of Ly5.1
pmel T cells was also increased in the anti-VEGF group compared with the rat IgG control (12.5 ± 2.8 × 105 versus 5.8 ± 1.0 ×
105, p2 = 0.034). Total tumor cell suspensions were gated on
live Ly5.1 cells. In mice treated with a single dose of 200 or
500 μg α-VEGF, we found significantly higher Ly5.1 + cell
(38.4%, P = 0.01 and 43.0%, P = 0.003, respectively) infiltration
into B16 tumor compared with mice receiving 500 μg of rat
IgG (17%) as early as day 4 post ACT (Fig. 3A). In addition,
we enumerated total live Ly5.1+ cells in tumor and found significantly higher number of cells in mice treated with 200 or
500 μg α-VEGF (4.1 × 105 cells, P = 0.03 and 2.2 × 105 cells, P =
0.001) when compared with mice receiving 500 μg of rat IgG
control (6.1 × 104 cells; Fig. 3B). In a repeat experiment (Fig. 3C
and D), we investigated T-cell infiltration on days 3, 4, 5, and 6

post ACT. Mice receiving a single dose of 200 or 500 μg
α-VEGF exhibited a higher percentage and total number of
live Ly5.1+ cells in the tumor when compared with the control
group (Fig. 3C and D). Thus, the enhanced antitumor effects in
our combination therapy were associated with and may be explained by the ability of α-VEGF administration to enhance
T-cell infiltration into the B16 tumor. Of interest, no increased
cell infiltration was seen when anti-VEGF antibody was given
on the day of cell infiltration, suggesting that the kinetics of the
impact of a single dose of anti-VEGF on tumor vasculature
relative to the time of cell infiltration is critical.

successfully used in various preclinical models as a monotherapy or combination therapy for tumor treatment (18,
22). We thus also screened the impact of DC101 administration along with ACT on established B16 tumor. In mice
bearing small tumors (25–50 mm2), three doses of DC101
alone (800 μg/dose) had some antitumor effect and prolonged the survival of mice compared with the rat IgG
control (Fig. 4A and B). The addition of DC101 to ACT
exhibited a significant (P = 0.013) additive antitumor effect
(Fig. 4A), while no significant additive impact was observed on prolonging survival (Fig. 4B). In mice bearing

large tumors (∼100 mm2), higher doses of DC101 (six
doses, 800 μg/dose) alone had no antitumor effect (Fig.
4C). When DC101 was added to ACT, we observed a small
but reproducible therapeutic impact (Fig. 4C, P = 0.028)
but no effect on survival (Fig. 4D). Thus, we next investigated whether treatment of tumor-bearing mice with a single dose of DC101 2 days before ACT augments enhanced
cell infiltration in to B16 tumors.
In contrast to our results using anti-VEGF administration,
data from eight consecutive experimental determinations
revealed no impact of the administration of the DC101

Figure 2. Combined therapeutic effect of anti-VEGF antibody with ACT on large B16 tumor treatment. A, the administration of four, six, and eight doses of
100 μg of anti-VEGF antibody alone had no impact on the growth of these large established B16 melanomas. A synergistic antitumor effect was seen
when six and eight doses of anti-VEGF antibody was given in conjunction with ACT (P = 0.009). B, survival of mice was also improved (P = 0.003). C, eight
doses of 100 μg of α-VEGF alone had no impact on tumor growth but synergized with ACT (P = 0.01). The impact of ACT with and without antibody
administration was dependent on the administration of 500 cGy total body irradiation before the cell transfer. D, survival of mice correlated with the
antitumor growth effect.

antibody on the percentage of live Ly5.1 cells infiltrating
into the tumor of mice 4 to 6 days after cell administration
(p2 = 0.33, paired t test). We could, however, detect an impact on vessel area within tumors after DC101 administration. The mean tumor vessel area of mice receiving a single
dose of DC101 remained relatively stable for at least 7 days,
whereas vessels increased significantly in mice receiving rat
IgG (Fig. 5A). Later time points were not tested. In a repeat
experiment, mice receiving rat IgG showed a significantly
increased (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.001, respectively) mean
tumor vessel area on days 3 and 4 (CD31 immunofluorescence staining) compared with mice receiving DC101 (Fig.
5B). Figure 5C represents a blinded, microscopic observation
made on days 0, 3, and 4 in the first experiment. Tumor vasculature on days 3 and 4 was less in mice receiving DC101
than in those receiving rat IgG. In a preliminary experiment

done with α-VEGF and rat IgG, a similar pattern was seen
(data not shown).

Discussion
The adoptive transfer of antitumor T cells (ACT) can
mediate tumor regression in both murine models and in
patients with metastatic melanoma (1–4). A lymphodepleting
preparative regimen applied before the adoptive transfer
profoundly enhances the therapeutic effects of the transferred cells in part by depleting immune regulatory elements
such as T regulatory cells and by eliminating competition of
the transferred cells for homeostatic cytokines (1–4, 24, 26).
Immunosuppressive factors produced by the tumor and
the integrity of the tumor vasculature can affect the activity
of lymphocytes and limit the extravasation of lymphocytes

from tumor vessels into the tumor stroma. VEGF produced
by tumor cells can mediate local immune suppression by
interfering with the function of antigen-presenting cells
and can stimulate the growth of tumor vasculature (6–12).
In murine models, inhibition of VEGF or its interaction
with its predominant receptor VEGFR-2 can overcome the
immunosuppressive activity of VEGF (12). Interruption of
the VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis can also normalize the tumor vasculature and enhance the extravasation of intravascular
components into the tumor stroma. The administration of
angiogenesis inhibitors can upregulate endothelial adhesion
molecules in tumor vessels and increases the number of
tumor infiltrating leukocytes (15). Several receptors, such
as endothelin B, have been identified as a molecule that
can affect lymphocyte infiltration into tumors (27). Several
studies have shown that blockade of VEGF or VEGFR-2 can
enhance the therapeutic effect of cancer vaccines and increase the numbers of vaccine-induced T cells that infiltrate
into tumor (14, 28).

Despite these effects of VEGF blockade, antiangiogenic
agents have had minimal clinical impact when used alone,
an observation that is probably due to the redundancy of angiogenic pathways. However, antiangiogenic treatments have
exhibited modest clinical effectiveness when administered in
conjunction with chemotherapy (19–21, 29). This impact has
been attributed in large part to the ability of antiangiogenic
drugs to increase extravasation of chemotherapy agents into
the tumor. The therapeutic effectiveness of ACT therapy in
cancer patients as well as the ability of antiangiogenic agents
to alter tumor vasculature in ways that could potentially increase the availability of tumor to the transferred T cells thus
led us to explore the combination of these approaches in
mice with large established B16 melanoma.
We thus evaluated antibodies against VEGF and VEGFR-2
for their ability to enhance ACT. Although these antibodies
could inhibit the growth of small tumors (∼50 mm2), they
had little impact on larger tumors that were ≥100 mm2
(Fig. 1). In an attempt to more closely mimic the treatment

three doses of 800 μg DC101 antibody mediated a modest growth-inhibitory effect on small established B16 melanoma compared with rat IgG alone.
An additive effect of the antibody was seen when combined with ACT (P = 0.013). Open symbols are groups receiving antibody alone; closed symbols are
groups receiving antibody with ACT (PVI group). C and D, six doses of 800 μg DC101 had no impact on the growth of large (100 mm2) B16 melanoma
but mediated a modest tumor-inhibitory effect when added to ACT. In accordance with our previous results, vaccination with recombinant vaccinia
virus expressing hgp10025-33 peptide was required to observe the tumor-inhibitory impact of ACT. Mice receiving PI (without vaccination) exhibited no
antitumor effect with or without anti–VEGFR-2 antibody administration.

experiments are shown. C, representative microscopic sections from mice receiving DC101 antibody or control rat IgG. Vessel area was determined by
a blinded measurement of CD31 expression. At 3 and 4 days after DC101 administration, a significant decrease in tumor vessels was seen compared with
mice receiving rat IgG.

of human tumors, we confined our studies to the treatment
of larger established vascularized B16 melanomas. When
treating these larger tumors, the addition of anti-VEGF antibody synergized with ACT therapy. The combination was
more effective than either modality used alone (Fig. 2). Prior
studies have shown that a lymphodepleting regimen is an essential component of ACT therapy in this mouse model (24).
In our studies, little therapeutic impact of ACT with or without anti-VEGF antibody was seen in immunocompetent
mice, whereas profound combined effects were seen in mice
pretreated with 500 cGy whole body irradiation. Multiple
doses of anti-VEGF antibody given every 3 days were essential to observe this synergistic therapeutic effect in conjunction with ACT. A dose of 100 μg anti-VEGF antibody was as
effective as higher doses, in accordance with prior reports indicating that in mice the 50 to 100 μg dose was optimal for
mediating antivascular effects (16). The dose and schedule of
antiangiogenic agents is a critical factor in the development
of effective combination therapies (19, 20).

The mechanism of action of the anti-VEGF–mediated antitumor activity is a matter of some controversy. Although the
inhibition of growth of tumor vessels seems to play a role,
there is considerable evidence that normalization of the properties of the tumor vasculature can substantially enhance
drug penetration into tumors (22, 23). Administration of antiangiogenic agents can sustain a hydrostatic pressure gradient
across the tumor vasculature by decreasing interstitial fluid
pressure and increasing pericyte coverage of tumor endothelium. Antiangiogenic agents can thus enhance infiltration of
labeled BSA from the vasculature into the tumor stroma (22).
To study the mechanism of action of the combination of cell
transfer therapy with anti-VEGF therapy, we explored whether this combination treatment could have an impact on
the extravasation of transferred antitumor T cells into the
tumor. These experiments clearly showed an increased percentage (p2 = 0.0051) and absolute number (p2 = 0.034) of
transferred T cells into tumor that was even apparent at
the lowest dose of anti-VEGF used (100 μg per dose; Fig. 3).

Adoptive Cell Therapy and Antiangiogenesis

The effectiveness of anti-VEGF administration to improve
ACT led us to investigate the effects of the administration of
the anti–VEGFR-2 antibody DC101. As was the case for the
use of anti-VEGF antibody, the administration of anti–
VEGFR-2 antibody could mediate an antitumor effect on
small tumors (50 mm2), but there was little to no impact
on large tumors (Fig. 4). There was, however, a modest
additive effect of anti–VEGFR-2 antibody in conjunction
with ACT. In these experiments, there was no increase
in infiltration of the adoptively transferred cells into tumor
(p2 = 0.33; Fig. 4E), possibly accounting for the lesser impact of this antibody compared with anti-VEGF. This may
also be, in part, due to the ability of anti-VEGF antibody
to block the binding of VEGF to both VEGFR-1 and
VEGFR-2, whereas anti–VEGFR-2 antibody could only
block VEGFR-2 binding. In these experiments, the anti–
VEGFR-2 antibody had some impact on angiogenesis because it was able to limit the growth of tumor vasculature
following a single dose of antibody (Fig. 5).
It should be noted that the ability of anti-VEGF antibody
to inhibit tumor growth in conjunction with cell transfer required the administration of multiple doses of antibody
(Fig. 2A and B) despite the demonstration that increased infiltration of the transferred lymphocytes could be seen after a
single dose of antibody. This implies that prolonged impact
of anti-VEGF antibody on the tumor vasculature is required

to observe the antitumor effect. Successful synergy of antiVEGF antibody with chemotherapy in humans also requires
prolonged anti-VEGF administration (29). Anti-VEGF antibody may also be manifesting antitumor effects in conjunction
with cell transfer by inhibiting the known immunosuppressive
impact of VEGF (6–11).
The studies reported here show that agents capable of
blocking the VEGF/VEGFR-2 axis can enhance the antitumor
activity of adoptively transferred antitumor T cells. The therapeutic effectiveness of ACT in patients with metastatic
melanoma and the ready availability of clinically approved
antiangiogenic agents provide a rationale for the exploration
of this combination therapy in the treatment of human cancer.
