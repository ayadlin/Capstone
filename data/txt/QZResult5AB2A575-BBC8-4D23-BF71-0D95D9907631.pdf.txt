Abstract
BH3 mimetic drugs induce cell death by antagonizing the activity of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors that function as transcriptional repressors downregulate the Bcl-2 family
member Mcl-1 and increase the activity of selective BH3 mimetics that fail to target this protein. In this study, we
determined whether CDK inhibitors potentiate the activity of pan-BH3 mimetics directly neutralizing Mcl-1.
Speciﬁcally, we evaluated interactions between the prototypical pan-CDK inhibitor ﬂavopiridol and the pan-BH3
mimetic obatoclax in multiple myeloma (MM) cells in which Mcl-1 is critical for survival. Coadministration of
ﬂavopiridol and obatoclax synergistically triggered apoptosis in both drug-na€ve and drug-resistant MM cells.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that ﬂavopiridol inhibited Mcl-1 transcription but increased transcription
of Bim and its binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. Obatoclax prevented Mcl-1 recovery and caused release of Bim from
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, accompanied by activation of Bax/Bak. Whether administered singly or in combination
with obatoclax, ﬂavopiridol also induced upregulation of multiple BH3-only proteins, including BimEL, BimL,
Noxa, and Bik/NBK. Notably, short hairpin RNA knockdown of Bim or Noxa abrogated lethality triggered by the
ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax combination in vitro and in vivo. Together, our ﬁndings show that CDK inhibition
potentiates pan-BH3 mimetic activity through a cooperative mechanism involving upregulation of BH3-only
proteins with coordinate downregulation of their antiapoptotic counterparts. These ﬁndings have immediate
implications for the clinical trial design of BH3 mimetic-based therapies that are presently being studied
intensively for the treatment of diverse hematopoietic malignancies, including lethal multiple myeloma. Cancer

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable accumulative disease of plasma cells characterized by dysregulation of Bcl
family members (1). These apoptosis regulatory proteins are
divided into pro- and antiapoptotic groups. The former consists of multidomain proteins (e.g., Bak and Bax) and BH3-only
proteins (e.g., Bim, Bid, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bik, Bmf, and Hrk,

etc.). The latter includes multidomain proteins, for example,
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (2). Although Bax and Bak are absolutely required for apoptosis, BH3-only proteins, which convert
noxious stimuli into death signals, consist of "activators" (e.g.,
Bim) and "sensitizers/derepressors" (e.g., Noxa, Bik; ref. 2).
Evidence implicating BH3-only proteins in anticancer agentinduced apoptosis (3, 4) prompted the development of
BH3 mimetics that bind to and inactivate antiapoptotic Bcl
proteins (5).
One such agent, ABT-737, binds avidly to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, but
not Mcl-1 (6). Consequently, relative levels of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
versus Mcl-1 determine susceptibility to this agent (7). Mcl1 is highly expressed in MM (e.g., in 51% patients at diagnosis
and 81% at relapse), and high Mcl-1 expression correlates with
poor clinical outcome (8). Mcl-1 also plays an important role in
resistance to agents such as bortezomib (9). Recently, the novel
pan-BH3 mimetic obatoclax has been developed, which in
addition to other antiapoptotic proteins, antagonizes the
activity of Mcl-1 in various tumors types (10, 11), including
hematologic malignancies such as MM. Preclinical in vitro
studies in MM showed single-agent activity and additivity with
other agents, but limited in vivo bioactivity when administered
alone (12).
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) regulate cell-cycle progression and transcription (13). Pan-Cdk inhibitors such as

ﬂavopiridol (alvocidib) act in part by inhibiting Cdk9, a kinase
involved in RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcription
elongation (13). Consequently, Cdk inhibitors block gene transcription and downregulate short-lived proteins including
Mcl-1, promoting apoptosis (14, 15). Clinical trials have suggested activity for ﬂavopiridol singly or in combination with
other agents in patients with hematopoietic malignancies,
including MM (16–18). Recently, several new-generation
pan-Cdk inhibitors (e.g., CYC202, SCH727965), which also
target Cdk9, have entered clinical trials (13).
Although pan-Cdk inhibitors have been shown to potentiate
ABT-737 lethality in transformed cells by downregulating Mcl1 (7), it is unknown whether synergistic interactions would
occur with pan-BH3 mimetics such as obatoclax, which bind
to/inactivate Mcl-1 (10). To address this question, we examined interactions between the pan-Cdk inhibitor ﬂavopiridol
and obatoclax in human MM cells. Here we report that
ﬂavopiridol synergistically increases obatoclax lethality in
diverse MM cells, including those resistant to novel agents,
in the presence of stromal cell factors, and in primary CD138þ
MM samples, but not in their normal counterparts. Signiﬁcantly, obatoclax/ﬂavopiridol coadministration, in sharp contrast to obatoclax alone, displays marked in vivo activity and
increases survival in multiple murine systems. From a mechanistic standpoint, the unexpected upregulation of multiple
BH3-only proteins, including BimEL, BimL, Noxa, and Bik/
NBK, cooperates with downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., Mcl-1, Bcl-xL) to play a signiﬁcant functional role in
lethality. Collectively, these ﬁndings provide proof-of-principle
for a novel anti-MM strategy in which pan-Cdk inhibitors are
combined with pan-BH3 mimetics and highlight the critical
importance of interplay between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in synergistic interactions between such agents.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
Human MM U266 and RPMI8226 cells were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained as
before (19). Both were authenticated (Basic STR Proﬁling
Service, ATCC 135-X) by ATCC immediately after this
study was completed. Bortezomib-resistant cells (PS-R) were
generated by continuously culturing U266 cells in increasing
concentrations of bortezomib (beginning at 0.5 nmol/L
and increasing in stepwise increments of 0.2 nmol/L) until
20 nmol/L, and maintained in medium containing 15 nmol/L
bortezomib. A revlimid-resistant RPMI8226 (R10R) cell line
was similarly established and maintained in 10 mmol/L revlimid (20). Dexamethasone-sensitive (MM.1S) and -resistant
(MM.1R) cell lines were provided by Dr Steven T. Rosen
(Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). U266/Mcl-1 and
RPMI8226/Bcl-xL cells were established by stably transfecting
full-length human Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL cDNA, respectively (19). All
experiments used logarithmically growing cells (3—5  105
cells/mL). MycoAlert (Lonza) assays were carried out, showing
that all cell lines were free of Mycoplasma contamination.
Bone marrow samples were obtained with informed consent
according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Review Board approval

from 4 patients with MM undergoing routine diagnostic
aspirations. CD138þ cells were separated using a MACS magnetic separation technique (Miltenyi Biotech). Normal CD34þ
hematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from 2 cord blood
(CB) samples; purity and viability were >90%, by ﬂow cytometry and trypan blue exclusion, respectively.
Obatoclax, ﬂavopiridol, and SCH 727965 were generously
provided by GeminX Pharmaceuticals, Sanoﬁ-Aventis, and
Merck, respectively, and by the National Cancer Institute, NIH.
Cycloheximide (CHX) and MG-132 were purchased from Sigma
and Calbiochem respectively, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), aliquoted, and stored at 20 C. In all experiments,
ﬁnal DMSO concentrations did not exceed 0.1%. Recombinant
human interleukin (IL)-6, IGF-1, BAFF, and APRIL were
obtained from PeproTech.
Procedures for in vitro studies
For procedures related to ﬂow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) staining, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR),
immunoblot, coimmunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, Bak and Bax conformational change, and RNA interference see Supplementary Materials and Methods (7).
Animal studies
Animal studies were approved by the Virginia Commonwealth
University The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee,
and carried out in accordance with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services, and
the NIH. Three mouse models were used in this study.
Model #1—subcutaneous (s.c.) ﬂank murine model. Athymic
NCr-nu/nu mice (NCI) were s.c. innoculated in the right rear
ﬂank with 5  106 RPMI8226 cells stably transfected with a
construct encoding luciferase. Treatment was administered
after luciferase activity was detected.
Model #2—s.c. dual-side ﬂank murine model. NOD/SCID-g
mice (Jackson Laboratories) were s.c. inoculated in 2 opposite
ﬂanks with 1  107 U266 cells stably transfected with constructs encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting either
Bim (shBim, left ﬂank) or scrambled sequence negative control
(shNC, right ﬂank).
Model #3—intravenous (i.v.) orthotopic murine model. NOD/
SCID-g mice (Jackson Laboratories) were i.v. injected with
5  106 U266 cells stably transfected with constructs encoding
luciferase.
Obatoclax mesylate (GX15-070MS) was freshly reconstituted
with 5% dextrose for injection (USP) and administered via
intramuscular (i.m.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. ﬂavopiridol in DMSO was diluted in 0.9% saline and administered via i.p.
injection. Control animals were injected with equal volumes of
vehicle. Mice were monitored for tumor growth every other day
visually or with the use of an IVIS 200 imaging system (Xenogen
Corporation). Measurement of animal body weight was carried
out every other day throughout the study to monitor toxicity.
Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula (L  W2)/2,
with L and W representing length and width respectively, and
when tumor size reached 2,000 mm3, mice were euthanized
in accordance with institutional guidelines.

cells (Fig. 1A), accompanied by a pronounced increase in both
early (annexin Vþ/PI) and late (annexin Vþ/PIþ) apoptosis
(Fig. 1B). Interactions occurred at obatoclax concentrations as
low as 300 nmol/L (data not shown). Median dose effect
analysis revealed CI values less than 1.0, indicating synergism
(Fig. 1C). Although individual treatment had only modest
effects, combined exposure markedly increased AIF and cytochrome c release (Fig. 1D, left), and caspase-3, -8, -9, and PARP
cleavage (right). Apoptosis was conﬁrmed by TUNEL staining
(data not shown). Concordant results were observed in other
human MM lines (Fig. 5C). Similar interactions were observed
when other pan-Cdk inhibitors (e.g., SCH727965) and pan-Bcl2 antagonists (e.g., HA14-1) were used (Supplementary
Fig. S1A).

Statistical analysis
Values represent the means  SD for at least 3 independent
experiments carried out in triplicate. The signiﬁcance of
differences between experimental variables was determined
using the Student t test or 1-way ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer
multiple comparisons test. The signiﬁcance of P values was
<0.05 ( ), <0.01 ( ), or <0.001 ( ) wherever indicated. Analysis
of synergism was carried out according to median dose effect
analysis using the software Calcusyn (Biosoft). Kaplan–Meier
analysis of mouse survival or hind-leg paralysis was carried out
using IBM SPSS Statistics software.

Results
Cdk inhibitors synergistically potentiate BH3 mimetic
lethality by engaging the mitochondria-related
apoptotic cascade
Coadministration (24 hours) of minimally toxic concentrations of obatoclax and ﬂavopiridol sharply reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased 7-AAD uptake in U266

phenomenon observed in an earlier study (14). Obatoclax alone
clearly decreased Mcl-1 levels in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (21). Notably, ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax coadministration
prevented recovery from Mcl-1 downregulation at later intervals
(e.g., 16–48 hours; Fig. 2A). Treatment with ﬂavopiridol with or
without obatoclax markedly diminished serine-2 phosphorylation of Pol II CTD at 6 hours (Fig. 2B, left) and 16 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S1B), indicating Cdk9/cyclin T (P-TEFb)
inhibition. Moreover, in ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax-treated cells,
coadministration of the translation inhibitor CHX further
reduced Mcl-1 levels (Fig. 2B, middle), whereas the proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 failed to restore Mcl-1 expression (Fig. 2B,

attenuated by ﬂavopiridol (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Effects on Bcl-xL, which cooperates with Mcl-1 to tether and

to ﬂavopiridol with or without obatoclax reduced Bcl-xL levels

tion of several BH3-only proteins, including Bim (EL and L
isoforms; Fig. 3A), Bik/NBK (Supplementary Fig. S3A), and
Noxa (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Consistent with results in other tumor cell types (21),
obatoclax played a major role in Noxa upregulation. Time
course analysis of U266 cells revealed that obatoclax alone
sharply increased Noxa levels as early as 6 hours after exposure,
but this effect was no longer apparent after 16 hours (data not
shown). Notably, obatoclax-induced Noxa upregulation was
sustained for longer intervals (e.g., at least 24 hours) in the
presence of ﬂavopiridol (Supplementary Fig. S3B, top). Similar
events occurred in RPMI8226 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B,
bottom). Importantly, Noxa shRNA dramatically blocked apoptosis induced by either bortezomib (23) or ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax (Supplementary Fig. S3C), arguing that upregulation of
the BH3-only protein Noxa plays a signiﬁcant functional role in
ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax lethality.

Upregulation of Bim at the transcriptional level plays a
signiﬁcant functional role in Cdk inhibitor/BH3 mimetic
interactions
The functional signiﬁcance of upregulation of the "direct
activator" Bim (24) was then examined. ﬂavopiridol induced
Bim expression (EL and L isoforms), with or without
obatoclax, in U266 (Fig. 3A, left) and RPMI8226 cells (right).
Immunoblot analysis conﬁrmed increased expression of
both Bim isoforms after ﬂavopiridol treatment alone (Fig.
3B, left) or in combination with obatoclax (right), events
occurring at 6 hours and sustained for at least 24 hours
after treatment. In contrast, obatoclax alone did not upregulate Bim (data not shown). ﬂavopiridol-induced Bim
induction was largely blocked by CHX (Fig. 3C), suggesting
a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, qRTPCR showed signiﬁcant increases in Bim mRNA levels at 3,
6, and 16 hours after ﬂavopiridol treatment with or without
obatoclax in both U266 and RPMI8226 cells (Fig. 3D and
Supplementary Fig. S3D), arguing that Bim upregulation by
ﬂavopiridol occurs at the transcriptional level.
Coimmunoprecipitation was carried out to examine interactions between Bim and antiapoptotic Bcl proteins.
Although bortezomib increased BimEL rather than BimL

(Obat; A, 500 nmol/L; B, 500–750

(btzmb) for comparison, U266 cells
were lysed in 1% CHAPS buffer and
subjected to coimmunoprecipitation
(co-IP). Blots were stripped and
subsequently reprobed with Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 (input) respectively.

bound to Bcl-2 and particularly to Bcl-xL, ﬂavopiridol alone
clearly increased Bim (both EL and L) binding to Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL (Fig. 4A). The latter events were markedly attenuated
by obatoclax. Interestingly, ﬂavopiridol or obatoclax alone
modestly diminished BimEL bound to Mcl-1, an effect only
slightly enhanced with the combination (Fig. 4A). In ﬂavopiridol-treated cells, unleashing of Bim from both Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL by obatoclax was associated with conformational
activation of Bax and to a lesser extent Bak (Fig. 4B, left),
as well as Bax mitochondrial translocation (right), triggering
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, caspase
activation, and pronounced apoptosis (Fig. 1D). Moreover,
transient transfection of a construct encoding Bax shRNA
signiﬁcantly diminished ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax lethality
(Supplementary Fig. S3E).
To deﬁne the functional role of Bim upregulation, U266
cells were stably transfected with a construct encoding
shRNA targeting Bim (shBim). In these cells, both BimEL
and BimL were substantially knocked down, compared with
shNC (Fig. 4C, left). Notably, shBim essentially abrogated
ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax-mediated lethality (Fig. 4C, right),
analogous to its ability to protect cells from bortezomib
(25). Consistent with these ﬁndings, shBim prevented Bax

BH3-Only Proteins Mediate BH3 Mimetic Activity

conformational change and translocation (Supplementary
Fig. S3F), caspase activation, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4D)
induced by ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax. However, coexposure to
ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax induced nearly equivalent Mcl-1
downregulation in both shNC and shBim cells (Fig. 4D).
Analogous results were obtained when another Bim shRNA
was used (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Together, these ﬁndings
raise the possibility that unleashing of upregulated Bim from
antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) by
obatoclax contributes to synergistic interactions. They also
argue that in the setting of downregulation of antiapoptotic
proteins, upregulation of BH3-only proteins such as Bim play
a critical functional role in lethality.
The Cdk inhibitor/BH3 mimetic regimen is active against
MM cells displaying conventional or novel forms of drug
resistance, as well as primary MM cells
In addition to drug resistance because of Bcl family dysregulation, microenvironmental factors also confer resistance in
MM (26). To address these issues, U266 cells were cultured in
the presence of HS-5 cells (a human bone marrow stromal cell
line; ref. 27), HS-5-conditional medium (CM), or both. Although
CM slightly reduced Bim levels, coculture with HS-5 markedly
downregulated Bim (Fig. 5A). Notably, HS-5 plus CM essentially
abolished Bim expression, raising the possibility that Bim
downregulation represents a mechanism underlying stromal
cell–mediated drug resistance (28). Importantly, neither HS-5
with or without CM prevented ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax lethality
(P > 0.05, Fig. 5B, left). Furthermore, addition of IL-6, BAFF,
APRIL, or IGF-1 also failed to attenuate ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax
lethality (P > 0.05, Fig. 5B, right), suggesting that the ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax regimen overcomes drug resistance related to
microenvironmental factors (e.g., stromal cells, cytokines, and
growth factors).
Dexamethasone-resistant (MM.1R) and revlimid-resistant
(R10R) cells exhibited roughly equivalent sensitivity to ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax, compared with their drug-na€ve counterparts (MM.1S and RPMI8226) respectively (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, bortezomib-resistant U266 cells (PS-R), which were
resistant to 20 nmol/L bortezomib (Fig. 5D, bottom), displayed
a clear increase in Mcl-1 levels, accompanied by a dramatic
reduction in Bim expression (24), particularly the EL isoform
(top). Signiﬁcantly, PS-R cells exhibited no cross-resistance to
ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax, compared with parental cells (Fig. 5D,
bottom), suggesting that MM cells exhibiting either conventional or novel forms of drug resistance remain fully susceptible to this regimen.
Although sensitivity to individual agents varied between
primary CD138þ MM specimens isolated from different
patients, cotreatment with ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax sharply
increased cell death (Fig. 5E). However, toxicity toward
CD138 bone marrow cells was minimal in all samples. Interestingly, despite differences between samples, CD138þ cells
displayed relatively higher levels of Bim compared with their
CD138 counterparts (data not shown; ref. 29). Furthermore,
ﬂavopiridol or obatoclax alone displayed only modest toxicity
toward normal CB CD34þ cells, whereas combined treatment
did not increase lethality (Fig. 5E), suggesting that this regimen

www.aacrjournals.org

is active against and relatively selective toward primary MM
cells.
The Cdk inhibitor/BH3 mimetic regimen displays
marked in vivo antitumor activity through a Bimdependent mechanism
Obatoclax reportedly lacked in vivo single-agent bioactivity
in mice bearing s.c. KMS12PE human MM tumors (12). To
determine whether the ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax regimen exhibits in vivo activity, athymic nude mice were inoculated in the
ﬂank with RPMI8226 cells carrying a luciferase gene. When
tumors became visible, mice were treated with ﬂavopiridol (5
mg/kg, i.p.) with or without obatoclax (3 mg/kg, i.m.). Consistent with previous reports (12), obatoclax (3 mg/kg) alone had
no effect on tumor growth, manifested by luciferase activity
(Fig. 6A, left). However, whereas ﬂavopiridol (5 mg/kg) alone
exerted modest but discernible effects, combined treatment
substantially suppressed tumor growth. The size of tumors
excised from mice conﬁrmed pronounced tumor growth suppression with combined treatment (Fig. 6A, right). Moreover,
tumor size measurements yielded concordant results (P ¼
0.0002; Fig. 6B). Interestingly, immunoblot analysis of tumor
tissues revealed that ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax coadministration
downregulated Mcl-1 and upregulated Bim (particularly the L
isoform) and Noxa, accompanied by caspase-3 activation and
PARP cleavage (Fig. 6C), consistent with in vitro observations.
To determine whether BH3-only protein upregulation (e.g.,
Bim) plays a signiﬁcant functional role in ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax lethality in vivo, NOD/SCID-g mice were inoculated s.c.
with U266 cells stably transfected with shBim or shNC respectively (Fig. 4C) in each ﬂank, after which ﬂavopiridol (3 mg/kg,
i.p.) with or without obatoclax (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered.
ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax coadministration markedly suppressed
growth of shNC tumors (Fig. 6D, right ﬂank), analogous to
results observed in the previously described ﬂank model (Fig.
6A–C). Notably, whereas a slight reduction in tumor size was
observed in the obatoclax group, no obvious growth suppression was observed by ﬂavopiridol alone or with obatoclax in
shBim tumors (Fig. 6D, left ﬂank), showing an important
functional role for Bim in ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax lethality
in vivo.
The bone marrow microenvironment plays a critical role in
survival, growth, and drug resistance of MM cells (26). The
activity of the ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax regimen was therefore
assessed in an animal model in which human MM cells form
bone marrow lesions, leading to bone disease at late intervals.
In this orthotopic murine model, NOD/SCID-g mice were i.v.
injected with U266 cells stably transfected with a luciferase
gene, after which homing and growth of tumor cells were
dynamically monitored by imaging luciferase activity. Notably,
U266 cells homed to bone marrow and then formed lesions at
skeletal sites (Fig. 7A), without detectable lesions in other
organs, ﬁndings conﬁrmed by IHC staining for human CD138
(data not shown). At later intervals (9–13 weeks after cell
injection), inoculated mice displayed hind-leg paralysis (Fig.
7B, right), a classic indicator of bone disease. After luciferase
signals were visible, ﬂavopiridol (5 mg/kg, i.p.) with or without
obatoclax (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered daily for 5 days,

þ
dexamethasone for comparison ( P < 0.05,   P < 0.01). The percentage of apoptotic (annexin V ) cells was then determined by ﬂow cytometry.
C, dexamethasone- (MM.1R) and revlimid-resistant (R10R) cells, as well as their drug-naïve counterparts (MM.1S and RPMI8226), were treated
(24 hours) with ﬂavopiridol (1S and 1R, 75 nmol/L; 8226 and R10R, 100 nmol/L) with or without obatoclax (1S and 1R, 500 nmol/L; 8226 and R10R, 750
nmol/L). The percentage of apoptotic cells was then determined by ﬂow cytometry. D, the bortezomib (btzmb)-resistant U266 cell line (PS-R) was
generated by continuously culturing U266 cells in gradually increasing concentrations of bortezomib. Immunoblot analysis was carried out to assess
expression of Mcl-1 and Bim on the same membrane (top). PS-R and its parental cell line were treated (24 hours) with 75 nmol/L ﬂavopiridol with or
without 500 nmol/L obatoclax, or 20 nmol/L bortezomib for comparison (P < 0.0001), after which the extent of apoptosis was determined by ﬂow
cytometry. E, CD138þ and CD138 cells were isolated from bone marrow samples of 4 patients with MM (Pt 1–4), and CD34þ cells isolated from 2 CB
samples. Cells were exposed (24 hours) to 75 to 100 nmol/L ﬂavopiridol with or without 300 to 500 nmol/L obatoclax, after which percentage of cell

(3 mg/kg) twice every 3 days. Tumor growth was monitored
every 2 days. As shown in Fig. 7A, combined treatment substantially reduced tumor burden compared with agents administered individually. Kaplan–Meier hazard analysis showed
that although obatoclax alone clearly delayed the appearance
of hind-leg paralysis, ﬂavopiridol alone had only minimal

any mice in the ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax group throughout the
entire 4-month observation period (P ¼ 0.0268; Fig. 7B, Supplementary Video). Moreover, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
revealed more prolonged survival of mice receiving combined
treatment compared with mice treated with ﬂavopiridol or

#1—s.c. ﬂank RPMI8226 model: athymic NCr-nu/nu mice were s.c. inoculated in the right rear ﬂank with 5  10 RPMI8226 cells carrying luciferase. Treatment
was initiated after luciferase activity was detected (7 days after injection of tumor cells). Mice were treated (indicated by arrow heads) with ﬂavopiridol (5 mg/kg,
i.p.) with or without obatoclax (3 mg/kg, i.m.), daily for the ﬁrst 3 days. After a 2-day interval (because of poor absorption of obatoclax after i.m. injection), the
schedule was adjusted to twice every 3 days for an additional 3 cycles; n ¼ 4 per group. Tumor growth was monitored every other day using the IVIS
200 Imaging System (A, left, images captured at day 28), and tumor size measured by calipers (B). When tumor size reached 2,000 mm3, all mice were
euthanized, and tumors removed from mice (A, right), after which tumor tissues were homogenized and subjected to immunoblot analysis (C). A discernible
loss of body weight (<10% of initial weight) occurred in both obatoclax and ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax groups during the ﬁrst week of treatment, which recovered
soon after the treatment schedule was adjusted. There was no discernible loss of body weight in another 2 groups throughout the experiment. D, mouse model

with or without obatoclax (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered daily for the ﬁrst 4 days, followed by once every 2 days for an additional 7 cycles; n ¼ 4 per group.
Tumor size was measured every other day (left); when tumor size reached 2,000 mm3, mice were euthanized, and tumors removed from mice (right). There was

neurologic toxicity (e.g., onset of agitation and hyperactivity),
which has been noted immediately after a rapid i.v. injection of
obatoclax (4 mg/kg; ref. 12), was not observed in mice after
either i.m. or i.p. obatoclax (3 mg/kg) alone or in combination
with ﬂavopiridol, similar to results with i.v. injection of 2 mg/kg
obatoclax in mice bearing solid tumors (11). Moreover, there
was no signiﬁcant loss of body weight (Fig. 7D) or other signs of

toxicity observed after ﬂavopiridol and obatoclax administered
alone or in combination in these murine systems. Together,
these ﬁndings argue that an anti-MM regimen combining a
pan-Cdk inhibitor with a pan-BH3 mimetic is active in vivo, and
suggest that mechanisms identiﬁed in vitro (e.g., upregulation
of BH3-only proteins such as Bim, Mcl-1 downregulation) may
be operative in vivo.

Discussion
Tumor cells are commonly characterized by overexpression
of antiapoptotic Bcl proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1),
which contribute to drug resistance by disabling the death
machinery (30, 31). Transformed cells also frequently express
proapoptotic Bcl proteins including multidomain (e.g., Bax and
Bak) and some, if not all, BH3-only proteins such as Bim (3, 4).
Although tumor cells may be fully equipped with anti- and
proapoptotic machinery, the latter are often inactivated
through binding to their highly expressed antiapoptotic counterparts (2). Because of the balance between anti- and prodeath
Bcl proteins, tumor cells may be "primed" for cell death (32) by
disrupting this balance, for example, by upregulating or mimicking proapoptotic protein actions, or by downregulating/
antagonizing the function of antiapoptotic proteins (33, 34).
The present ﬁndings show that pan-Cdk inhibitors markedly
potentiates the lethality of pan-BH3 mimetics (e.g., obatoclax) in vitro and in vivo in MM cells, including those
displaying conventional or novel forms of drug resistance.
They also reveal that these agents interact synergistically by

4234

interfering with both arms of the apoptosis-regulatory balance, that is, downregulating/disabling Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Mcl-1, and upregulating BH3-only proteins including Bim,
Noxa, and Bik/NBK.
Pan-Cdk inhibitors like ﬂavopiridol act as transcriptional
repressors by inhibiting Cdk9, a catalytic subunit of the cyclin
T/Cdk9 complex (P-TEFb), preventing serine-2 phosphorylation of RNA Pol II CTD, thereby blocking transcription elongation (13) and inducing downregulation of short-lived proteins such as Mcl-1 (14), an essential survival factor for MM
cells (35). The present results show that ﬂavopiridol downregulates Mcl-1 at early intervals (e.g., 6 hours) in association
with diminished CTD serine-2 phosphorylation. However, Mcl1 expression recovered after 16 hours, indicating that ﬂavopiridol rapidly but only transiently inhibits Mcl-1 transcription in
cells (14). Recently, obatoclax was shown to downregulate Mcl1 through induction of Noxa, which binds to Mcl-1 and triggers
its degradation, whereas qRT-PCR revealed more than a 5-fold
increase in Mcl-1 mRNA levels after obatoclax exposure (6 hrs;
ref. 21). Similar events were observed in this study, but mRNA

BH3-Only Proteins Mediate BH3 Mimetic Activity

upregulation was largely blocked by ﬂavopiridol. Although the
mechanism underlying these phenomena is uncertain,
increases in Mcl-1 mRNA may represent a compensatory
response to downregulation of the protein. Importantly, obatoclax strikingly blocked recovery from Mcl-1 protein downregulation after prolonged ﬂavopiridol exposure (e.g., 16–48
hours), suggesting that persistent Mcl-1 downregulation
following ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax coexposure may reﬂect 2
separate but cooperative mechanisms: (i) Mcl-1 mRNA transcription inhibition by ﬂavopiridol; and (ii) promotion of Mcl-1
protein degradation through Noxa induction by obatoclax.
However, Mcl-1 overexpression only partially attenuated ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax-mediated apoptosis at 24 hours, but not at
intervals 48 hours, raising the possibility that the ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax regimen may circumvent Mcl-1-related drug
resistance.
MM cells exposed to ﬂavopiridol with or without obatoclax
exhibited sharp increases in expression of BH3-only proteins
including Bim (EL and L isoforms), Noxa, and Bik/NBK. Unlike
Bax/Bak, protein levels of which are relatively stable (2), and
which must be activated to trigger apoptosis, expression of
BH3-only proteins is tightly regulated, and thus represents a
candidate target (3, 36). Many novel agents induce expression
(e.g., HDAC inhibitors; ref. 19) or prevent degradation (e.g.,
proteasome inhibitors; ref. 37) of BH3-only proteins such as
Noxa, Puma, and Bim, thereby directly or indirectly activating
Bax/Bak (2). Obatoclax antagonizes Mcl-1 antiapoptotic functions by unleashing Bim or Bak from Mcl-1, and also downregulates Mcl-1 via induction of Noxa (21). This ﬁnding
shows that obatoclax induced Noxa upregulation at early
intervals (e.g., 6 hours), and that this event was enhanced and
rendered more sustained by ﬂavopiridol. Functionally, both
Noxa and Bim shRNA profoundly diminished ﬂavopiridol/
obatoclax lethality. Thus, although downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL) may contribute to the
lethality of this regimen to a limited extent, upregulation of
BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bim and Noxa) clearly plays a critical
role in Cdk inhibitor/pan-BH3 mimetic interactions.
The marked increase in Bim (both EL and L isoforms) by
ﬂavopiridol with or without obatoclax has, to the best of our
knowledge, not been described previously. Transcriptional
regulation of Bim represents a major mechanism of apoptosis
regulation (38). Several ﬁndings argue that ﬂavopiridol upregulates Bim at the transcriptional level. First, translation
inhibition by CHX largely blocked Bim upregulation induced
by ﬂavopiridol. Second, qRT-PCR indicated that ﬂavopiridol
induced a marked increase (e.g., 3- to -5-fold) in Bim mRNA
levels. In this context, transcriptional regulation of Bim is
complex and multifactorial. For example, growth factor withdrawal-induced Bim upregulation requires JNK activation in
neurons, although it depends on the forkhead transcription
factor FKHR-L1 in hematopoietic cells (3). Moreover, the bim
promoter is regulated by stress-related transcriptional factors
such as FOXO and AP-1 family members (38). The mechanism
by which a pan-Cdk inhibitor transcriptionally that upregulates BH3-only proteins such as Bim is not intuitively obvious.
One possibility is that ﬂavopiridol may activate JNK that
upregulates BH3-only proteins to sensitize human myeloma

www.aacrjournals.org

cells to Bcl-2 antagonists (e.g., HA14-1; ref. 39). Another possibility is that Cdk2 inhibition by pan-Cdk inhibitors may
activate FOXO1 (40), which induces Bim transcription (41).
In addition to transcriptional induction, Bim also exhibits
multifactorial regulation at the levels of mRNA stability, posttranslational modiﬁcations, proteasomal degradation, and
cellular localization (38, 42). Consequently, the possibility that
additional mechanisms contribute to Cdk inhibitor-mediated
Bim upregulation cannot be excluded.
The observation that Bim shRNA knockdown essentially
abrogated apoptosis indicates a critical functional role for Bim
upregulation in Cdk inhibitor/pan-BH3 mimetic lethality.
Mechanisms of Bim-mediated cell death may reﬂect direct
actions following displacement/derepression of antiapoptotic
proteins by BH3-only "sensitizers," leading to Bax/Bak activation. Alternatively, in the neutralization model, Bim binds to
and neutralizes/inactivates all antiapoptotic Bcl proteins that
repress constitutively active Bax/Bak. Obatoclax releases Bim
from Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 binding, thereby promoting
apoptosis (10, 12). Interestingly, ﬂavopiridol upregulated
expression of Bim but increased its binding to Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL, suggesting that upregulated Bim may "prime" cells for
death (43, 44). Indeed, obatoclax unleashed Bim from Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, leading to Bax/Bak activation and cell death
in Cdk inhibitor-treated cells. Signiﬁcantly, the latter event (i.e.,
Bax/Bak activation) did not occur in cells in which Bim was
knocked down by shRNA. Notably, in a dual-sided ﬂank murine
model that circumvents problems in interpretation related to
mouse-to-mouse variability (45), ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax failed
to suppress the growth of tumors carrying Bim shRNA, showing a functional in vivo role for Bim in lethality. Finally, the
observation that obatoclax released Bim from multiple antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) suggests that
as observed in the case of BH3 mimetics (e.g., ABT-737)
administered alone (43), interactions between Bcl family
members, rather than simply their expression proﬁles, may
be critical predictors of sensitivity to the Cdk inhibitor/panBH3 mimetic regimen in MM.
MM cells interact with the bone marrow microenvironment to promote cell proliferation, survival, migration, and
drug resistance. Genetic proﬁling studies revealed that Bcl
family members represent microenvironment-speciﬁc chemotherapeutic response determinants in malignant hematopoietic cells, and that BH3-only "activators" are necessary for
cell death (45). IL-6 and IGF-1, which are critical for MM
cell/microenvironment interactions, promote MM cell survival and confer drug resistance through (i) Mcl-1 induction
(46, 47) and (ii) Bim downregulation (34, 48). The latter
involves at least 2 mechanisms, for example, posttranslational phosphorylations and/or transcription (48). Notably,
ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax was fully active in the presence of
these cytokines or other autocrine MM survival/growth
factors (e.g., BAFF and APRIL; ref. 49). Direct MM cell–
stroma contact also contributes to MM drug-resistance (28).
Interestingly, HS-5 coculture and conditioned medium largely abrogated Bim expression in MM cells, implicating this
phenomenon as a mechanism of stromal cell–mediated drug
resistance. Signiﬁcantly, ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax lethality

persisted under these conditions. ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax also
suppressed in vivo growth of MM cells that homed to bone
marrow, arguing further that the Cdk inhibitor/pan-BH3
mimetic strategy may circumvent bone marrow microenvironment-mediated drug-resistance. Finally, ﬂavopiridol/
obatoclax was active against multiple drug-resistant cell
lines. Interestingly, bortezomib-resistant cells (PS-R) exhibited marked Bim downregulation accompanied by modestly
increased Mcl-1, supporting a recent concept that Bcl-2
family member dysregulation determines MM cell susceptibility to therapeutic interventions (34). Importantly, these
cells were also fully susceptible to ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax.
Collectively, these ﬁndings argue that those resistance
mechanisms fail to protect MM cells from Cdk inhibitor/
pan-BH3 mimetic regimens, which coordinately target both
pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl family members.
The marked lethality of ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax in primary
CD138þ MM specimens, with minimal toxicity toward their
normal CD138 counterparts or CD34þ hematopoietic cells,
raises the possibility that MM cells may be particularly
susceptible to this strategy. Signiﬁcantly, in marked contrast
to obatoclax administered alone, combined treatment produced marked suppression of tumor growth in vivo in both s.
c. ﬂank and i.v. orthotopic models. Particularly in the latter,
in which MM cells selectively homed to the bone marrow
and produced MM-speciﬁc bone disease, coadministration
of ﬂavopiridol/obatoclax markedly improved outcomes for
these animals, for example, signiﬁcantly preventing hind-leg
paralysis and prolonging survival. Such ﬁndings argue that
although pan-BH3 mimetics such as obatoclax may not
be sufﬁcient by themselves to induce cell death in vitro
or in vivo, additional perturbations (e.g., prolongation of
antiapoptotic protein downregulation in conjunction with
upregulation of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins) induced by
pan-Cdk inhibitors may trigger a constellation of events that
exceed the apoptotic threshold. In summary, the present

ﬁndings provide a preclinical justiﬁcation for combining
pan-Cdk inhibitors, possibly including new-generation Cdk
inhibitors that have recently entered the clinic (13), with
pan-BH3 mimetics (e.g., obatoclax; ref. 50) in MM and other
hematologic malignancies. They also highlight the critical
importance of coordinate disruption of pro- and antiapoptotic arms of the apoptotic regulatory machinery in promoting transformed cell death.
