ABSTRACT
Tumor therapy needs new approaches in order to improve efficacy and reduce
toxicity of the current treatments. The acidic microenvironment and the expression
of high levels of endogenous non-telomerase reverse transcriptase (RT) are common
features of malignant tumor cells. The anti-acidic proton pump inhibitor Lansoprazole
(LAN) and the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor Efavirenz (EFV) have shown independent
antitumor efficacy. LAN has shown to counteract drug tumor resistance. We tested the
hypothesis that combination of LAN and EFV may improve the overall antitumor effects.
We thus pretreated human metastatic melanoma cells with LAN and then with EFV,
both in 2D and 3D spheroid models. We evaluated the treatment effect by proliferation
and cell death/apoptosis assays in classical and in pulse administration experiments.
The action of EFV was negatively affected by the tumor microenvironmental acidity,
and LAN pretreatment overcame the problem. LAN potentiated the cytotoxicity of
EFV to melanoma cells and, when administered during the drug interruption period,
prevented the replacement of tumor cell growth.
This study supports the implementation of the current therapies with combination
of Proton Pumps and Reverse Transcriptase inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

limiting side effects, including neurological disorders,
cutaneous eruptions and teratogenesis [13–15]. CNS
toxicity, such as dizziness, headaches, and depression
and psychiatric events have consistently been reported in
40%–60% and in 25%–40% of patients respectively. This
is the main reason for discontinuing/switching therapy
[11, 16–18]. Unfortunately, in HIV patients the
discontinuing therapy resulted in unresponsiveness upon
reinstitution of the protocol. Moreover cases of resistance
to EFV have also been emerging [11, 19].
We have shown that the reverse transcriptase
inhibitor Efavirenz exert also a potent anti-tumor
activity [3–5]. Recently one preclinical study has
demonstrated that higher dosage of Efavirenz respect to
the 600 mg/day recommended for AIDS treatment, may
offer possible benefit for the treatment of metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer patients [20]. This
EFV toxicity due to high dosage used, led us to study a
strategy to overcome the EFV toxicity and improved the
antitumor response.

Undifferentiated cells and tumor cells often express
high levels of endogenous non-telomerase reverse
transcriptase of retroposone/retroviral origin [1–3].
Some in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that this
protein plays an important role in the development and
progression of several tumors, including melanoma,
prostatic, mammary and pancreatic carcinomas [4–6].
Many pharmacological approaches have been attempted
to counter this role, including different inhibitors [7]. Our
group has been successfully investigating, in vitro and
in vivo, the potential antitumoral action of two inhibitors
of the two new oncotargets, Reverse Transcriptase
(RT) and Proton Pumps: the non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor, Efavirenz (EFV) [4] and the proton
pump inhibitor (PPI) Lansoprazole [8, 9] respectively.
EFV is part of the currently adopted multi-agents
protocols devised for the treatment of HIV infections
[10–12]. Despite its efficacy, EFV is associated with

Tumor extracellular acidity is one of the key
factors responsible for chemoresistance [21, 22]. Two
reasons explain the role of pH gradient reversal in
chemoresistance, the first one is linked to the protonation
of antineoplastic drugs that are weak bases [23] and the
second one is linked to the biophysical ultrastructure
changes happening at the level of the cellular membrane
due to pH changes [24–26]. While the former explains why
weak base drugs cannot cross the cell membrane of drug
resistant cancer cells, the later provides a solid ground for
a similar mechanism for all antineoplastic drugs including
weak base. It is therefore a generic concept as far as drug
delivery and uptake by cells is involved. Extracellular
acidity is associated with cytosolic alkalinity in cancer
cells, and this “reverse of pH gradients”, represent a
hallmark of malignancy [27, 28]. This microenvironmental
acidity is triggered by the lactate accumulation due to the
sugar fermentation (Warburg’s effect) and the consequent
hyperactivity of proton exchangers that pump or exchange
the H+ outside the cells or inside the internal vacuoles,
[22, 29]. This was supported by in vivo studies in both
animal models and tumor patients [30–32].
We recently developed a novel approach to counter
tumor acidity by off-label using PPI [33]. PPI are
currently used as anti-acid drugs for treatment of peptic
diseases [34, 35]. They are prodrugs which need acidic
pH to be transformed in the active molecule (tetracyclic
sulfonamide), thus they may accumulate in acidic tissues,
activated and act there [36].
Our preclinical investigations have shown that PPI
can be used as both chemosensitizers and direct antitumor
agents as well [36–42] A wide panel of human tumors have
been shown to be responsive to PPI while with different
intracellular mechanisms [37, 43, 44] and this might be
better managed in tumor patients, by in vivo measuring of
tumor pH [45].
The pre-clinical studies triggered a series of clinical
studies on PPI, in either human patients with cancers and
companion animals with spontaneous tumors, supporting
the use of these antiacidic compounds in future anticancer strategies and excluding any levels of systemic and
specific toxicity, even at very high dosage [46–50].
In a recent study we have shown that PPI, while
belonging to the same class of generic drugs, have different
chemical features, and most of all a different in vitro and
in vivo anti-tumor effect. In fact, Lansoprazole (LAN) was
the most effective in terms of cytotoxic effect against a wide
panel of human tumor cells and tumors [8]. We have also
shown that LAN is very effective in both modulating tumor
acidification and enhance sensitivity to suboptimal doses of
anti-tumor drugs, such as Paclitaxel, and this was consistent
with a significant reduction of systemic toxicity [9].
In this work we demonstrated in 2 and 3D spheroid
melanoma models that: 1) LAN enhances the antitumor
effect of EFV, 2) the combination of EFV and LAN is
more effective than the single agents, 3) LAN can be

used in the EFV interruption period, thus preventing the
occurrence of tumor chemoresistance towards EFV.
Of interest these two drugs have not been
developed as antitumoral agents: Lansoprazole is a wellestablished first line treatment for gastric hypersecretion
and esophageal reflux, while the primary use of EFV is
part of multi-drug protocols for the treatment of HIV
[11–13]. These results, provide a clear evidence on
the use of Proton pumps and Reverse Transcriptase as
new oncotargets, and that the combination of specific
inhibitors, such as Lansoprazole and Efavirenz, might be
considered an innovative and effective new strategy to be
implemented to the currently adopted antitumor therapies.

RESULTS
Acidic microenvironment of tumor cells reduces
Efavirenz efficacy
This set of experiments was aimed at establishing
whether the acidic microenvironmental condition
could indeed be responsible for some level of low
responsiveness of human tumor cells to the action of
EFV. To this purpose we initially tested three different
conditions for the melanoma cell culture: 1) buffered
medium, the cell culture standard condition; 2)
unbuffered medium (in vitro condition simulating the
spontaneous acidification occurring within tumors); 3)
pH 6.5 medium (the hypothetical tumor acidic condition,
previously used in our melanoma experimental setting)
[8]. These two latest conditions, beside mimicking
the tumor microenvironment, are also instrumental to
allow the activation of PPI, well known prodrugs with
a specific delivery for acidic compartments where they
are transformed into the active molecule (tetracyclic
sulfonamide). In a recent study, we have shown that
among several members of the PPI family, Lansoprazole
was the one showing the best antitumor efficacy, even
at suboptimal doses [8]. We first tested the effect of
different pH conditions on the antitumor activity of EFV,
in term of either proliferation or cytotoxicity. The results
showed that the effectiveness of EFV was much impaired
by the acidic conditions. In fact, at EFV concentration
of 20, 30 and 40 µM acidic conditions (unbuffered and
pH 6.5) highly impaired the EFV inhibitory effect on tumor
cell proliferation as compared to the buffered medium
(Figure 1A). However, the most clear effect induced by
the acidic conditions was on the cytotoxic effect of EFV.
These experiments showed that while there was a clear
dose dependent cytotoxic effect in the buffered conditions,
at unbuffered and acidic pH conditions the percentage of
dead cells was always significantly lower (Figure 1B).
Based on these results, we established the 20 µM EFV
concentration as the reference dose for the following
experiments, considering this value as the suboptimal
concentration that allowed an adequate cell survival.

Lansoprazole pre-treatment of melanoma cells
enhances Efavirenz anti-tumor effect both in
cell monolayer and in 3D spheroid models

monolayer experiments (Figure 3A and 3B). However,
the apoptotic effect of the Lansoprazole/Efavirenz (LE)
combination was more marked than what we obtained with
cell proliferation assays. Moreover, the combination of the
two drugs led to an apoptotic response that was the sum of
the two single treatments, suggesting a synergistic effect.

This set of experiments was carried out in unbuffered
condition, mimicking the acidic microenvironment of
tumors [8]. As previously reported, both EFV and LAN
had antitumor effect as single agents [3–5, 8, 37, 43].
To explore their potential combinatory effect both drugs
were administered at suboptimal concentrations (i.e.
20 µM EFV for 96 hours and 50 µM LAN for 48 hours
in monolayer experiments; 30 µM EFV and 75 µM
LAN in experiments performed with 3D spheroids). In
the experiments performed with standard cell culture
conditions (monolayer), the combination of the two drugs
led to a significant reduction of cell proliferation (80%)
(Figure 2A), as compared to the effect of the single agents.
In all conditions the anti-proliferative effect was associated
to a cytotoxic effect, again more evident when the two
drugs were used in combination, and it was mostly due to
apoptosis (Figure 2B).
In the following set of experiments, we used
melanoma spheroids, condition mimicking the 3D
configuration of in vivo solid tumors [51]. The results
showed effects comparable to those showed in the

efficacy in pulse administration protocol
Clinically, in AIDS patients EFV discontinuing
therapy is performed to reduce toxic effects, resulting in
variable levels of unresponsiveness following a second
round of therapy. The aim of this set of experiments was
to evaluate whether LAN treatment performed during the
window period between two EFV administrations could
improve the antitumor efficacy of EFV. To this purpose
melanoma spheroids were cultured in unbuffered condition
with either single or combined treatments, as specified in
Figure 4 legend. As showed in Figure 4 the most effective
combination was that alternating LAN and EFV (LEL).
This LAN/EFV combined treatment was more effective
than two EFV administrations, using both proliferation and
cytotoxicity assays, suggesting that LAN not only might be
effectively used during the period of EFV interruption, but

that it can well potentiate the effectiveness of EFV during
the treatment periods. This was obtained with suboptimal
drug concentrations, further suggesting that this approach
may lead to a real reduction of the known EFV toxicity in
all conditions where it is used as curative drug.

Melanoma is a worldwide diffused tumor that still
lacks an effective therapy for the advanced stages [52].

programs aimed at an early tumor detection. Indeed, it has
been ascertained that cutaneous melanoma can be cured
if the neoplasm is surgically removed at an early stage, as
defined in the Breslow classification [53]. When the tumor
is detected at an advanced stage or if it is deeply developed
passing the dermal layer, then there are few therapeutical
options that can prevent or arrest the tumor progression
[52]. Several protocols have been devised over the years,
including the use of chemotherapy (either standard or
limb perfusion), biological agents and immunotherapy
drugs with limited success [54–59]. The recent use
of monoclonal antibodies [60] is becoming to move
something positive in this “pharmacological stalemate”
in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, there
is a urgent need of new more effective, less toxic and
possibly less expensive therapeutical options. Here we
provided evidence that the combination of proton pumps
and reverse transcriptase inhibitors exerts a real effect
against human malignant melanoma cells in both 2D and
3D culture conditions.
Previous studies of our group have shown that proton
pump inhibitors have both a direct antitumor action [8, 37,
43, 44] and chemosensitizing activity [9, 33, 48, 49] against
a variety of transplanted and spontaneous neoplasms in
animals and humans. An ad hoc study has also shown that
between the most representative molecules of this class of
drugs, Lansoprazole has the most potent antitumor effect
both in vitro and in vivo [8].

We have also shown that the reverse transcriptase
inhibitor Efavirenz exerts a potent anti-tumor activity [3–5].
To date the unique clinical use of Efavirenz for the
treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
patients [20] is impaired by different side effects, due to the
used higher dosage of Efavirenz respect to the 600 mg/day
recommended for AIDS treatment. Lowering the daily dose
of Efavirenz without affecting the drug’s efficacy may be
an efficient manner to control Efavirenz-related toxicity in
some patients.
It is known that the tumor microenvironment
is acidic [21, 27, 30–32] and that this peculiar tumor
condition impairs the most of anti-tumor drugs
effectiveness [9, 28, 33, 46–48]. Here we have shown
that acidic pH medium remarkably reduced the antitumor
effect of Efavirenz. The pre-treatment of melanoma
cells with Lansoprazole (a prodrug that contrarily to the
other drugs is activated in acidic condition) significantly
improved the Efavirenz antitumor effect, supporting the
results obtained with other therapeutic molecules [61]. The
same results were obtained in 3D culture condition that
reproduce the solid mass of tumors.
In this study we provided the proof of concept that
Lansoprazole and Efavirenz can have a synergic action
against human melanoma with a combined effectiveness
almost equal to the sum of their single effects. More
importantly, the alternate administration protocol of the
two agents was the one showing the greatest effectiveness,

thus providing the evidence that this sequential way of
administration could be adopted in a clinical approach to
cancer, together with decreasing the possible side effects
associated with long term administration of Efavirenz.
Furthermore, both agents have been used at suboptimal
concentrations, thus opening an avenue for the adoption
of more conservative protocols that while maintaining
a significant efficiency at the same time will have a
greater tolerability for the patients. Moreover, Efavirenz
can be used in neoadjuvant therapies of melanoma and
other malignant tumors in order to avoid tumor relapses
following both surgery and chemotherapy. We also know
that PPI can counteract the tumor immune escape due
to the microenvironmental acidity [62, 63]. Finally, the
results of this study give support to new investigations
aimed at the setting up of either hybrids or combined
molecules containing both Proton Pumps and Reverse
Transcriptase inhibitors. In addition both Proton Pumps
and Reverse Transcriptase may represent new targets
for more specific and possibly less toxic anti-tumor
molecules. However, these preclinical data obtained with
commercially available drugs may hopefully trigger the
setting up of clinical trials in order to translate these results
to the patients’ bed. This is in part already occurred with
PPI with clinical trials, four in human patients [46, 47,
50, 64] and two in domestic animals with spontaneous
tumors [48, 49] and with EFV in a clinical trial performed
in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients
[20]. Of course we need data of a series of clinical trials
obtained with either PPI or Efavirenz, in order to further
support the use of Proton Pumps and RT-inhibitors
combination therapies that this study is proposing.

Human metastatic melanoma Me30966 (supplied
by Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori,
Milan, Italy) was maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics, at
37°C in humidified 5% CO2. Experiments were performed
in buffered (B), unbuffered (UNB) and pH6.5 RPMI-1640
cell culture medium (Lonza). The cell line was negative
for mycoplasma contamination, as routinely tested by
modified nested polymerase chain reaction (VenorGeM
Kit, Minerva Biolabs, Germany).
To allow spheroid formation, 15 × 103 Me30966
cells were cultured in 96-well plate (Costar Ultra Low
Attachment, Sigma.Aldrich) in complete cell culture
medium until 72 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2 in continuous
rotation.

Cell proliferation assay
Melanoma cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells per
well in 96-well plates in buffered RPMI medium (2D
model) or at 15 × 103 cells in 96-well plate in 0.2 ml cell
culture medium (3D spheroid model). After 24 hours,
the medium was replaced with fresh, unbuffered or
acidic RPMI medium and cells were treated with EFV
and/or Lansoprazole as specified in the results section.
After treatment, cell proliferation was determined using
4-Nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate tablets
(Sigma-Aldrich) and the cell survival was evaluated by
the 405 nm absorbance measured by a spectrophotometer
ELx800 (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). All experiments were
run in triplicate wells and repeated at least twice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell death assay

Chemicals and reagents

Melanoma cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells per well
in 12-well plates in 1ml of buffered RPMI medium (2D
model), or at 15 × 103 cells in 96-well plate in 0.2 ml
medium (3D spheroid model). After 24 hours, the medium
was replaced with unbuffered or acidic medium. After
other 24 hours, necessary for cell medium adjustment,
cells were treated with Lansoprazole e/o Efavirenz,
following the reported experiments. Then, cells were
collected by pooling cells from the medium (i.e., dead
cells) and adherent (live) cells obtained by trypsinization.
Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS with 0.4%
trypan blue 1:1 (vol/vol) dilution or incubated with
AnnexinV-FITC/Propidium Iodide for apoptosis detection
(Enzo Life Sciences) as reported in the manufacturer’s
instruction. Cells were then analyzed by Flow cytometry
on a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur using CellQuestPro
software (Becton Dickinson System). For each sample the
total events were acquired in 60 seconds. All experiments
were run in triplicate wells and repeated at least twice.

Lansoprazole was purchased by Sigma-Aldrich
(Milan, Italy) and was dissolved at 20 mM in DMSO
in absence of direct light and reconstituted immediately
prior its use. Efavirenz was purified from commercially
available Sustiva (Bristol-Myers Squibb) as described [3],
dissolved in DMSO and added to the culture medium in
the indicated concentrations and times. RPMI-1640 cell
culture medium (BE12-702F), antibiotics (DE17-603E),
phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (BE17-512F), trypsin/
EDTA (BE17-171E) and fetal bovine serum (DE14-701F)
were obtained from Lonza (Milan, Italy). Trypan blue was
bought from Alexis Biochemicals (Florence, Italy) and
Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis detection kit from Enzo Life
Sciences (Lausen, Switzerland). 4-Nitrophenyl phosphate
disodium salt hexahydrate tablets for proliferation assay
was from Sigma-Aldrich.
The pH of all cell culture supernatants were estimated
by the use of a pH 123 Microprocessor pH Meter (Hanna
Instruments, Italy).
