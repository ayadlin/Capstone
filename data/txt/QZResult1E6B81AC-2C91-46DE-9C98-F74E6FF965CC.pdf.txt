ABSTRACT
Background: Drug development in sarcoma has been hampered by the rarity
and heterogeneity of the disease and lack of predictive biomarkers to therapies.
We assessed protein expression and gene alterations in a large number of bone
and soft tissue sarcomas in order to categorize the molecular alterations, identify
predictive biomarkers and discover new therapeutic targets. Methods: Data from
sarcoma specimens profiled for protein expression, gene amplification/translocation
and DNA sequencing was reviewed. Results: 2539 sarcoma specimens of 22 subtypes
were included. TOPO2A was the most overexpressed protein at 52.8%. There was
overexpression or loss of other sarcoma relevant proteins such as SPARC, PTEN and
MGMT. Approximately 50% of the sarcomas expressed PD-L1 by IHC and presented
with PD-1+ TILs, notably the LMS, chondrosarcomas, liposarcomas and UPS. Gene
amplification/rearrangement of ALK, cMYC, HER2, PIK3CA, TOPO2A and cMET was
relatively uncommon. EGFR gene amplification occurred at a rate of 16.9%. DNA
sequencing of 47 genes identified mutations in 47% of the samples. The most
commonly mutated genes were TP53 (26.3%) and BRCA2 (17.6%). Overexpression
of TOPO2A was associated with TP53 mutation (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: This data
provides the landscape of alterations in sarcoma. Future clinical trials are needed to
validate these targets.

those with recurrent chromosomal translocations
resulting in abnormal fusion proteins (e.g. synovial
sarcomas). More commonly, sarcomagenesis is a result
of complex chromosomal abnormalities, as in the case
of leiomyosarcomas and high grade undifferentiated
pleomorphic sarcomas [2].
Analyses of genetic alterations in sarcoma have
generally focused on particular subtypes [3, 4] and
frequently employ limited methodologies. Data from
large scale, systematic genomic profiling of sarcomas
is limited. Barretina and colleagues characterized 207
sarcoma specimens, including seven different subtypes,
by DNA sequence, copy number alterations and mRNA
expression. They were able to identify potentially
druggable PIK3CA mutations in 18% of myxoid
liposarcomas [5]. Conversely, a separate series, by Cote

INTRODUCTION
Sarcomas are a rare, heterogeneous group of
mesenchymal tumors. With over 100 subtypes, a
single therapeutic strategy for this group of cancers is
unfeasible. For patients with advanced disease, the
selection of therapy is based on the specific sarcoma
subtype as well as the patient’s fitness to receive
aggressive chemotherapy. With this approach, median
overall survival for patients with advanced bone and
soft tissue sarcomas (STS) remains under two years
[1]. Sarcomas can be classified according to the genetic
alterations involved in their development: those with
oncogenic somatic mutations [e.g. gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST)], those with DNA copy number
alterations (e.g. dedifferentiated liposarcomas), and

and colleagues found that when solely using DNA hotspot
analysis or whole exome sequencing, mutations were
rare and there was no pattern of alterations noted within
sarcoma subtypes [6].
Protein biomarkers have been studied for many
decades, in an attempt to predict which tumors will
respond to what therapies. This is best highlighted in
the breast cancer field, where the proteins estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) have been
well established as prospective treatment response
biomarkers [7, 8]. To date, a large analysis for common
chemotherapy associated biomarkers has not been
performed across a large group of sarcomas. A detailed
mapping of the therapy associated biomarkers will allow
for identification of both targets and histologies that may
respond to a particular drug, in order to design better
clinical trials [9].
Using a registry of 2539 patients with bone and soft
tissue sarcomas we have catalogued changes in protein
expression, gene amplification/translocation, and somatic
mutations. Herein we describe these findings with the goal
of systematically characterizing the molecular alterations
in a variety of sarcoma subtypes, identifying potential
biomarkers of sensitivity to chemotherapy and targeted
agents, and potentially discovering novel therapeutic
targets.

angiosarcoma, LMS, rhabdomyosarcoma and UPS. High
expression of TOPO2A has been previously reported
at a rate of 50% in STS, when median percentage was
chosen as the cutoff to discriminate between high and
low expressing tumors, rather than criteria previously
described in breast cancer [10, 11]. Overexpression
of serum protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC),
a biomarker for albumin bound paclitaxel, was seen in
35.9% of the cases, especially in over 60% of epithelioid
hemangioendothelioma (EHE) and chondrosarcoma
(notably conventional chondrosarcoma), as well as
48.7% of angiosarcomas. A previous study of SPARC
expression by IHC, noted a rate of high SPARC staining
in 56% of specimens, but given the small sample size
(n  = 27), specific histology correlations could not be
made [12]. Low MGMT expression, a temozolomide
associated biomarker, was noted in a variety of sarcomas
including alveolar soft part sarcoma (21 ASPS), desmoid,
EHE, perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa),
endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), giant cell tumor,
liposarcoma, LMS, malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumor (MPNST), osteosarcoma and UPS. There was
low expression of MGMT in 65.3% of the sarcomas
overall. Previous studies have only considered nuclear
staining positive, and have reported a much lower rate of
MGMT loss in LMS and other STS subtypes, therefore
validation of a particular method is required to determine
the predictive value in STS [13]. PTEN loss was seen
in 38.6% of the sarcomas, most commonly in epithelioid
sarcoma, chordoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and
osteosarcoma. PTEN loss was only noted in 32.2% of
non-uterine LMS and 37.6% of uterine LMS. Previous
work on complex genomic sarcomas such as LMS,
UPS and MPNST have reported rates of PTEN loss
in 29%–44% of the sarcomas, [14, 15] but data on the
expression of PTEN in rarer sarcomas is lacking. cKIT
overexpression was noted in 28.5% of angiosarcoma,
19% of desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT)
and 37.3% of Ewing’s sarcoma. There were 2 cases
of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma, both of which
overexpressed cKIT. This is a rare sarcoma whose
treatment paradigm is not yet clearly defined. PDGFRA
was overexpressed in 22.1% of the sarcomas, including,
38.5% of angiosarcoma, 33.3% of liposarcoma, 33.3%
of fibrosarcoma, 31.8% of Ewing’s sarcoma, 30.8% of
chondrosarcoma, 27.8% of osteosarcoma, 27.8% of
UPS and 18.3% of non-uterine LMS. High PDGFRA
expression has been described previously in many of these
tumors [16–18]. In a series by Rodrigo and colleagues
HER2 protein expression by IHC was negative in all
sarcoma samples [10]. HER2 overexpression was noted
in only one case in this series, an ESS, confirming that
this is not an important pathway in sarcoma (Figure 1a
and 1b and Supplementary Table 1).
AR overexpression was seen in 18.3–54.2% of
myxoid chondrosarcoma, DSRCT, pleomorphic and

RESULTS
Population
2539 sarcoma specimens encompassing 61 bone and
STS subtypes were profiled. These included 22 standard
histologies, and an “other” (n = 454) category, that
included sarcoma NOS (n = 251) and spindle cell
tumor (n = 103), as well as 37 sarcoma subtypes that
had fewer than 10 cases. The most common histology
was leiomyosarcoma (LMS) (n = 751) with 401 of
these uterine, followed by liposarcoma (n = 220) and
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [UPS (formally
malignant fibrous histiocytoma) (n = 166)]. Of the
77 angiosarcomas, 14 were of breast origin. 862 samples
were known to be from a metastatic site. The median age
of the population was 53 (range: 1–92). 62% of the cases
were from females. Up to 2434 samples were profiled
by IHC, 1048 by FISH/CISH, 591 by NGS and 1250 by
Sanger sequencing. 530 samples were profiled on all three
platforms (IHC, FISH/CISH and either NGS or Sanger
sequencing).

Protein biomarkers
TOPO2A overexpression, an anthracycline
associated response biomarker, was noted in 52.8%
of the sarcomas and in greater than 60% of MPNST,

MPNST (BRAF V600E), osteosarcoma (cKIT, FLT3),
rhabdomyosarcoma [FLT3 (pleomorphic), PIK3CA
(uknown/other), PTEN (unknown/other), PTPN11
(alveolar), SMARCB1 (unknown/other)], solitary fibrous
tumor (cKIT, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, STK11), synovial
sarcoma (ABL1, ATM, BRAF, cKIT, KDR, MLH1) and
UPS (KDR, PIK3CA). BRCA2 mutations were seen in
17% of LMS, both uterine and non-uterine. PTEN and
RB1 mutations were noted exclusively in non-uterine
LMS and not in those of uterine origin. NRAS mutations
were detected in 20% of non-breast angiosarcomas,
and were not found in those of breast origin. The
PIK3CA mutations noted in liposarcoma (5 cases) were
found in 4 myxoid liposarcomas and in 1 high grade
pleomporphic liposarcoma. No EGFR mutations were
detected in our series (Figure 2a–d and Supplementary
Table 3). One case of MPNST carried a G12V KRAS
mutation. We detected BRAF, PTEN, p53 and NRAS
mutations in angiosarcoma specimens, not previously
described in the literature [4].

well-differentiated liposarcoma, ESS and LMS. ER
overexpression was seen in 47.8% of ESS, 23.0% of
non-uterine LMS, 60.3% of uterine LMS and 23.5%
of PEComas (Figure 1c and Supplementary Table 1).
The  rates of ER overexpression in uterine LMS appear
similar to previous studies [19, 20]. This data also
confirms the rate of ER positivity in non-uterine LMS
at approximately 20% with a much larger number of
cases [21].
Overall, approximately 50% of the sarcomas
expressed PD-L1 by IHC and presented with PD-1+ TILs,
similar to other series [22]. Sarcomas with sufficient
number of cases and overexpression of these proteins
included LMS, chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma and UPS.
Only 4 cases of synovial sarcoma were available for
testing, 1 of which had simultaneous overexpression
of PD-L1 and presence of PD-1+ TILs (Figure 1d and
Supplementary Table 2). This rate is lower than published
literature [22].

FISH/CISH
The most commonly amplified gene was EGFR
at a rate of 16.9% overall. This was especially noted in
histologies such as DSRCT, LMS, MPNST, osteosarcoma
and UPS at a rate of 20% or higher. Smaller sarcoma
series have suggested a lower rate of amplification
overall (3.5%), most commonly in UPS [23]. In series
focusing on MPNST specifically, the rate of EGFR gene
amplification by FISH was 28–37% [24, 25]. None of the
synovial sarcomas in our series demonstrated genomic
amplification of EGFR, consistent with previous work
[26]. Amplification of the ALK, cMYC, PIK3CA and
TOPO2A genes were relatively uncommon events. cMET
was amplified in 5–6% of osteosarcoma and synovial
sarcomas. HER2 was amplified in 5.6% of MPNST
(Table 1).

Biomarker associations
There was relatively low concordance across
platforms for individual genes or proteins (Table 2). For
example, cKIT overexpression by IHC was infrequently
associated with cKIT mutations. This is in contrast to the
scenario in GIST, where more than 80% of cases carry an
activating mutation in the KIT gene [27]. In our series,
overexpression of TOPO2A by IHC was not associated
with TOPO2A gene amplification, similar to some series
in breast cancer and in contrast to others [28, 29]. We also
examined the association of TP53 or PIK3CA mutations
with other alterations (Table 3 and Table 4). We noted
that 85.8% of samples demonstrated both TOPO2A
expression by IHC and TP53 mutation (P value =
0.0001). Three patient tumor samples had both a PIK3CA
mutation and PTEN loss by IHC (myxoid liposarcoma,
rhabdomyosarcoma and sarcoma, NOS). Two patient
samples had EGFR amplification and KRAS mutation
(1 MFH and 1 ESS).

DNA sequencing
591 samples were profiled by NGS and 1250
by Sanger sequencing. 47% of the samples had an
identifiable mutation in 35 of the 47 genes analyzed.
The most commonly mutated genes overall were
TP53 (26.3%) and BRCA2 (17.6%). Histologies
carrying mutations at a frequency of ≥ 5% included:
angiosarcoma (APC, BRAF, GNA11, HRAS KDR, KRAS,
NRAS), chondrosarcoma [IDH1 (conventional and
unknown/other), PTEN (myxoid), cMET (conventional
and mesenchymal)], desmoid (APC, CTNNB1, STK11),
ESS (AKT1, cMET, FGFR2, GNAS, KRAS, RET,
SMO), Ewing’s sarcoma (APC, ATM, HNF1A, PTEN),
fibrosarcoma (KRAS), giant cell tumor (KRAS), myxoid
liposarcoma (AKT1, ATM, cMET, JAK3, PIK3CA,
PTEN), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (HNF1), well-

DISCUSSION
This data set represents the largest number of
sarcoma cases molecularly profiled to date. We observed
that TOPO2A was overexpressed in approximately 50%
of sarcomas, without associated gene amplification,
most commonly in the angiosarcomas, LMS,
MPNST, rhabdomyosarcoma and UPS. Indeed,
amplification of the TOPO2A gene has not reliably
predicted increased protein levels of TOPO2A in other
cancers [11, 29, 30].

[35]. It has been postulated and shown in TP53 wild type
xenograft models that upon treatment with doxorubicin,
there is induction of a senescent phenotype leading to
cell cycle arrest and subsequent resistance to treatment
[36, 37]. This mutational status could therefore serve as a
biomarker for sensitivity to anthracyclines in sarcoma and
requires further study.
SPARC is a serum albumin-binding glycoprotein
secreted by endothelial cells. It is hypothesized that
tumoral SPARC could serve as a biomarker for sensitivity
to the albumin-bound nanopartical of paclitaxel NABpaclitaxel. In pancreatic cancer, SPARC overexpression
was correlated with response rate to nab-paclitaxel and
prolonged progression free survival [38]. Clinically,
angiosarcomas and EHE are essentially the only sarcoma
subtypes where single agent taxanes are of benefit [39].
Though, SPARC expression has been assessed in sarcoma
specimens, only 1 case of angiosarcoma has previously
been evaluated and was found to have high expression
of SPARC [12]. In our study, interestingly, SPARC
was overexpressed in angiosarcoma, chondrosarcoma
and EHE. A clinical trial of nab-paclitaxel in a wide
variety of bone and soft tissue sarcomas did not meet
its primary endpoint. However, this study did not assess
for SPARC status or include patients with angiosarcoma
or EHE [40]. MGMT gene silencing through promotor

Anthracylines have served as a cornerstone for the
treatment of sarcomas for decades. Response rates to
single agent doxorubicin range from 9% to 27% [31, 32],
with clinical benefit in approximately 60% of patients
[33]. The mechanisms related to the lack of benefit seen
in some patients are not entirely clear. TOPO2A is an
important target for anthracyclines and its inhibition leads
to double-strand DNA breaks and cell death. In breast
cancer, TOPO2A protein expression by IHC has been
correlated with response to anthracyclines [34], however
this has been confounded by the co-expression of HER2.
In sarcoma, a retrospective study of TOPO2A expression
in 78 patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy with
an anthracycline, found that histologic response was
positively correlated with high expression of TOPO2A
[10]. This finding requires prospective validation.
Although previous work has suggested overexpression of
HER2 in approximately 50% of synovial sarcomas [26],
none of the sarcoma specimens in this series co-expressed
HER2. These findings also suggest that TOPO2A protein
expression is not controlled by gene copy number, but
through RNA or post-translational mechanisms. Our
analysis also found an association between TOPO2A
overexpression by IHC and TP53 mutation status. Indeed,
in some studies, breast tumors containing TP53 mutations
are exquisitely sensitive to anthracycline based therapy

partial loss of PTEN gene by array-comparative genomic
hybridization (a-CGH) occurs in 39% of sarcomas with
complex genomics and that this may be sufficient for a
pathologic phenotype [14]. On the other hand, PTEN
promoter methylation appears to be an uncommon event
and may not play a major role in down-regulation of
PTEN expression [14, 15]. In our study PTEN loss was
most notable in the chordomas, epithelioid sarcomas,
alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas and osteosarcomas.
Though loss was noted in the LMS cohort, this was
only seen in about 35% of the cases. Disappointingly,
targeting this pathway with mTOR inhibitors has been
unsuccessful clinically [43], possibly owing to the fact that
preselection of tumors with alterations in the PI3-kinase
pathway was not required for trial enrollment. Overall,
the rate of PIK3CA and PTEN mutations was low in our
series. PTEN mutations were most commonly seen in
chondrosarcomas (7.7%), myxoid liposarcomas (16.7%),

methylation confers sensitivity to the alkylating agents
in glioblastoma [41]. Previous work has suggested that
20% of STS have MGMT loss by IHC and 8% have both
promoter methylation and negative IHC nuclear staining.
Response to temozolomide has been noted in a patient
with a resistant undifferentiated high grade sarcoma whose
tumor demonstrated MGMT promoter methylation and
protein loss by IHC [42].
Targeted therapy has improved outcomes of
patients with solid tumors such as lung and kidney cancer.
Pazopanib remains the only FDA approved targeted
therapy in STS, as other trials of novel agents have
largely been unsuccessful when tested in a broad- range of
sarcomas. Biomarkers predicting response would therefore
be of utility. The PI3-kinase pathway is of great interest
in sarcoma and cancer in general. Previous studies have
shown PTEN partial genomic loss and loss of protein
expression in LMS. Gibault and colleagues showed that

Ewing’s sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (6.3%). Previous
work has demonstrated PIK3CA mutations in 14–18% of
myxoid and round cell liposarcoma [3, 5]. In our series,
PIK3CA mutations were most commonly seen in myxoid
liposarcoma (23.5%), as well as in rhabdomyosarcoma
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(7.4%), solitary fibrous tumor (6.3%) and UPS (5.5%).
We had 1 case of myxoid liposarcoma with both PTEN loss
by IHC and PIK3CA mutation, not previously described
in the literature [3]. We also detected pathogenic PTEN
mutations in angiosarcoma specimens, which have not
12242

previously been described in the literature [4]. Finally,
our data suggests the co-existence of PTEN and TP53
mutations, as well as TP53 mutations and PTEN loss
in sarcoma specimens. Indeed, it is known that there is
considerable crosstalk between these two tumor suppressor
genes [44, 45]. The prognostic effect of this phenomenon is
not known in sarcoma; therefore validation against phase
III clinical data is needed. Our data also confirmed the rate
of ER positivity in LMS. A phase II study of the aromatase
inhibitor letrozole in these patients has demonstrated
clinical benefit [46]. On the other hand, though PDGFRA
was overexpressed in many tumors consistent with
previous work [16–18], phase II studies of imatinib in
PDGFR- positive sarcomas failed to show benefit [18, 47].
Newer immunotherapies have demonstrated success
in melanoma, kidney cancers and lung cancers, but have
not yet been evaluated in sarcoma [48]. Currently of most
interest are the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Previous work
has shown that both PD-1 and PD-L1 positivity were
independent prognostic indicators for OS and EFS in
sarcoma [22]. PD-1 positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells were seen in 65%
and 58% of STS cases respectively. Uncertainty remains
as to the effectiveness of PD-L1 expression in tumor as
a biomarker for sensitivity to the checkpoint inhibitors as
patients with low or no expression of PD-L1 may still have
a response and/or survival benefit [49]. PD-L1 expression
was noted in the majority of chondrosarcomas, LMS, UPS
and liposarcoma in our series.
Protein expression is a semi-quantitative, inclusive
end-point. Changes in protein level may be a result of
mutations, increased gene copy number, changes in
gene expression, or biochemical responses within the
cell to environmental factors. In other solid tumors,
there is concordance between protein expression by
IHC and mutation or gene amplification as in the cases
of cKIT and HER2 respectively [50, 51]. However,
discordance has been documented across solid tumors
for cMET, TOP2A, and PTEN [30] , proposed to be due
to downstream modulation of protein expression levels.
There was relatively low concordance across platforms
in our series, suggesting that protein levels of cKIT,
cMET and TOPO2A may be regulated at the RNA or post
translational level. On the other hand, IHC for certain
proteins such as EGFR, is known to be unreliable, owing
the antibodies and scoring system used [23]. In fact, a
prior clinical trial of gefitinib in synovial sarcomas with
enrollment limited to patients overexpressing EGFR
by IHC was without responses to this agent. Twentyone percent of patients did have stable disease [52].
In addition, no EGFR mutations were detected in our
sarcomas, consistent with other series [24]. Our data set
suggests that EGFR gene amplification could be used
instead of IHC as a biomarker for sensitivity to the EGFR
inhibitors. This gene amplification was most notable in
DSRCT, LMS, MPNST, osteosarcoma and UPS.

There are several limitations to this analysis.
Though all specimens underwent pathology review to
confirm a diagnosis of sarcoma, the specific subtype was
determined by the submitting institution’s pathologist.
This is problematic for non-specific diagnoses such as
fibrosarcoma, which may in fact represent a heterogenous
group of tumors. The lack of concordance across
platforms observed in this series is of interest. This may be
attributed, as in the case of EGFR, to the unreliability of
IHC. In this case, it seems that copy number analysis may
be more useful. On the other hand, the lack of concordance
between cKIT activating mutations and increased protein
expression suggests an inadequacy in the methodology
used to detect these genetic alterations. In fact, there was
a low frequency of actionable mutations detected in this
series overall, suggesting that Hotspot analysis has limited
scope in sarcoma and techniques such as whole exome
sequencing should be explored. Despite these limitations
in technique, there were a few noteworthy observations,
including alteration of the RAF/RAS/MEK/ERK pathway
in angiosarcoma. Finally, this analysis does not include
details on treatment history and/or patient outcomes
which would be useful as a first step in validation of these
potential biomarkers.
These data represent a large analysis of molecular
alterations by sarcoma subtype. Although there are
limitations of this analysis, this data catalogue provides
the groundwork for future clinical trials in sarcoma
and highlights the need for the sarcoma community to
prospectively validate tumor biomarkers in our clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from sarcoma specimens profiled on at least
one platform by Caris Life Sciences from January 11, 2006
through July 31, 2014 were included. Formalin fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sarcoma samples were sent
for analysis from treating physicians around the world
(59 countries). The specific sarcoma histology was extracted
from paperwork submitted by the treating physician. GIST
was excluded, to limit the analysis to sarcomas without
known therapeutic targets. Tumors were initially verified by
a board certified pathologist for sufficient tumor presence
and to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoma. Any sample
reviewed and determined not to be a sarcoma was excluded
from this cohort. Samples were subsequently analyzed
using one or more of the profiling platforms as described
below. Biomarkers for analysis were selected based on
their potential to be targeted therapeutically and/or based
on clinical evidence of a utility in other solid tumors.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Protein expression was determined by IHC analysis,
using commercially available detection kits and automated
staining techniques (Benchmark XT, Ventana, and
12243

Oncotarget

AutostainerLink 48, Dako) [53]. Antibodies used included:
androgen receptor (AR), topoisomerases 1 and 2 (TOPO1,
TOPO2A) (Leica Biosystems); ER, PR, cMET, HER2
(Ventana); cKIT, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
phosophatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (Dako), O(6)methylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT), P-glycoprotein
(PGP) (Invitrogen); transducin-like enhancer of split 3
(TLE3, Santa Cruz); ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1,
Protein Tech); SPARC (monoclonal, R&D Systems;
polyclonal, Exalpha), tubulin beta-3 chain (TUBB3)
(Covance), Excision Repair Cross-Complementation
Group 1 (ERCC1, (Abcam), platelet derived growth
factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA, Thermo), Programmed
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and Programmed death-ligand
1 (PD-L1) (BD Pharmingen and R&D Systems). IHC
thresholds previously validated in other cancers were used,
as cutoffs are not established in sarcoma (Appendix 1).
