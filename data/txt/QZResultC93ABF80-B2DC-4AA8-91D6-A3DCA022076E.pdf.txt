Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RIG-I (Retinoic acid Inducible Gene - I) is a cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptor that
recognizes pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs to differentiate between viral
and cellular RNAs. RIG-I is activated by blunt-ended double-stranded (ds) RNA with or without a
5′-triphosphate (ppp), single-stranded (ss) RNA marked by 5′-ppp1 and poly-uridine sequence2,3.
Upon binding to such PAMP motifs, RIG-I initiates a signaling cascade that induces innate
immune defenses and inflammatory cytokines to establish an antiviral state. The RIG-I pathway is
highly regulated and aberrant signaling leads to apoptosis, altered cell differentiation,
inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer4,5. The helicase and repressor domain (RD) of
RIG-I recognize dsRNA and 5′-ppp RNA to activate the amino-terminal two CAspase
Recruitment Domains (CARDs) for signaling. To understand the synergy between helicase and
RD for RNA binding and the contribution of ATP hydrolysis to RIG-I activation, we determined
the structure of human RIG-I helicase-RD in complex with dsRNA and an ATP-analog. The
helicase-RD organizes into a ring around dsRNA, capping one end, while contacting both strands
utilizing previously uncharacterized motifs to recognize dsRNA. Small angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS), limited proteolysis, and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) suggest that RIG-I is in
an extended and flexible conformation that compacts upon binding RNA. These results provide a
detailed view of the helicase role in dsRNA recognition, the synergy between RD and the helicase
for RNA binding, organization of full-length RIG-I bound to dsRNA, and evidence of a
conformational change upon RNA binding. The RIG-I helicase-RD structure is consistent with
dsRNA translocation without unwinding and cooperative binding to RNA. The structure yields
unprecedented insight into innate immunity and has broader impact into other areas of biology,

To investigate the contributions of the individual domains of RIG-I to RNA binding, we
employed fluorescence anisotropy and determined the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd)
of the protein-RNA complexes. The tightest RNA affinity was observed with the helicaseRD, while the full-length RIG-I, helicase domain, and RD bind dsRNA with a 24-fold,
8600-fold, and 50-fold weaker affinity, respectively, and all proteins bind RNA with a 1:1
stoichiometry (Table 1 and Supplemental Fig. 1). Consistent with the affinities, full-length
RIG-I and helicase-RD demonstrated robust dsRNA stimulated ATPase activity, whereas
the helicase domain showed a weak ATPase (Table 1). Interestingly, the presence of a 5′ppp in dsRNA does not alter the stoichiometry of RNA binding, although the 5′-ppp dsRNA
binds more tightly than the 5′-OH dsRNA to full-length RIG-I.

Crystals of RIG-I helicase-RD in complex with ADP•BeF3 and 14 base pair palindromic
(pal) dsRNA diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution (Supplementary Table 1). The dsRNA maintains
an A-form helical conformation and interacts with all four domains of helicase-RD, which
are arranged into a ring around dsRNA (Fig. 1a–c). The RecA-like helicase domain (domain
1) progresses to an alpha helical domain (domain 3) and into the second RecA-like helicase
domain (domain 2) that ends with the RD. The striking features of the RIG-I structure are
the linkers that connect the domains. Domains 1 and 3 are connected by a beta strand that is
part of the parallel beta sheet in domain 2. The RD is connected to domain 2 via a prominent
V-shaped linker, consisting of two alpha helices that interact extensively with domains 1 and
2 with a buried surface over 1,500 Å2. The V-shaped linker extends into a proline-rich
(796KPKPVPD) loop that makes the final connection to the RD. Interestingly, T770 at the
vertex of the V-shaped linker is one of the phosphorylation sites that regulates RIG-I
signaling6.
Molecular surface analysis shows that one end of the dsRNA is capped by the entire
helicase-RD molecule while the opposite end of the RNA is exposed (Fig. 1d–f). At the
capped end, the 5′ terminus of the dsRNA abuts the RD domain but the 3′ terminus is
somewhat exposed through a highly basic channel (Figs. 1b,e). The 3′ terminus RNA strand
will be referred to as the 3′ strand, while the opposite strand as the 5′ strand. This basic
channel may allow RIG-I to recognize dsRNA with 3′ nucleotide overhangs or 3′
monophosphate that are products of RNase L digestion7. Additionally there are visible
channels along the long axis of the dsRNA, which may allow the domains to flex and
accommodate bulges or noncanonical base pairs (Fig. 1e–1f).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All four domains of the helicase-RD participate in dsRNA binding, burying a total of 1,500
Å2 of surface area to encircle about eight base pairs (Fig. 2a). Most contacts are with the
sugar phosphate backbone of both strands but there are few base specific interactions. The
F853 in the RD stacks over the terminal C1-G14 base pair, and H830 and S854 form
hydrogen bonds with the ribose 2′-OH of C1 (5′-strand) and G14 (3′-strand), respectively.
Phosphorylation of S854 and S855, shown to negatively regulate RIG-I signaling6, would be
predicted to adversely impact RNA binding. The RD-RNA contacts in the helicase-RD
structure are identical to those identified in the structures of the isolated RD bound to
dsRNA8–10. Residues H847, K858, and K861 of RD, reported to interact with the 5′-ppp,
are not making any new interactions in the helicase-RD structure. The only RD contact with
the 3′ strand, other than at the blunt end, is between S906 and the U7 phosphate backbone.
The core helicase (domains 1 and 2) contains characteristic motifs critical for RNA binding
and ATP hydrolysis11 (Supplementary Fig. 3). The two helicase domains together contact
five nucleotides from the 3′-end of the 3′-strand (G14-C10) and four nucleotides in the

middle of the 5′-strand (C4-U7) (Fig. 2a). Motif Ib (S325 and G326) and motif Ic (T347,
Q349 and N353) of domain 1 contact the ribose-phosphate backbone of the terminal base of
the 3′-strand (G14), while motif Ia (N298, Q299, and I300) interacts with C13 and U12.
Motifs IV, IVa, IVb, and V in domain 2 interact with the 3′-strand from C13 to C10.
Residues in motif IV (K635, T636, and R637) interact with the phosphate backbone of G11C10. Similarly motif IVa (T662, G663, and R664) and motif IVb (Q678) contact the
backbone of C13-G11, and motif V (V699) interacts with the RNA backbone at C10.
All RIG-I-like helicases contain a large insertion (domain 3) between the core helicase
domains12. The structure of the RIG-I like helicase, Hef, showed a similar alpha-helical
domain 3, except it is rotated in RIG-I due to dsRNA interactions (Supplementary Fig. 4).
An alpha helix within domain 3 (residue 506–522) of RIG-I runs almost perpendicular to the
minor groove of the dsRNA and interacts with the 3′ strand without contacting the 5′-strand
(Fig. 2a). The interactions of the domain 3 with the dsRNA via residues E510, V514 and
K518 extend the helicase contacts to U7 and A8 of the 3′-strand.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although most interactions of the RIG-I are with the 3′ strand, all three helicase domains
are in close proximity to the 5′-strand and two new motifs contact the 5′ strand. Motif IIa
(379KQHPY) immediately follows motif II (372DECH) and interacts with C4–C6 of the 5′
strand. Similarly, N720 in motif Vc in domain 2 contacts the 5′ strand backbone at C6 and
U7. These new motifs may represent a general feature of helicases binding to dsRNA or
dsDNA since a region similar to motif IIa was identified in the Swi/Snf2 family helicases
and a Rad54 homolog dsDNA complex structure13.
RIG-I helicase-RD contains one ADP•BeF3 molecule bound at the interface of domains 1
and 2 via the conserved helicase motifs Q, I, II, III, V, and VI, which are generally involved
in ATP binding/hydrolysis (Fig. 2b)12. The Q motif makes adenine specific contacts, while
the other motifs are involved in binding the triphosphate moiety and the Mg2+. Motif I
(267GCGKT) contacts the phosphates and the BeF3, which mimics the γ-phosphate of ATP
as observed in other SF2 helicases12. The D372 and E373 of motif II (372DECH) coordinate
the Mg2+ to stabilize the ATPanalog. The helicase motifs Va and VI, which contact the
ribose and phosphates of the ATP in other helicases, are close to ADP•BeF3.

RIG-I has been shown to have translocation activity on dsRNA14 and reported to unwind
short dsRNA15, although we (data not shown) and others14 have failed to detect unwinding
activity. Superposition of RIG-I with hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase (NS3h) bound to
ssDNA16 (Fig. 3a) makes predictions about translocation and lack of helicase activity of
RIG-I. First, ssDNA in NS3h overlays with the 3′-strand of the dsRNA bound to RIG-I,
suggesting that the RIG-I helicase makes principal motor contacts with the 3′-strand (Fig.
3b) when translocating along dsRNA. Second, a conserved Phe-loop in NS3h bisects the
dsRNA, consistent with its implicated role in unwinding17 (Fig. 3b–c). The absence of such
a motif in RIG-I could explain the lack of RNA unwinding activity. Interestingly, the RIG-I
RD positions over domain 3 of NS3h, implicating that this domain of NS3h may interact
with the 5′ strand of dsRNA (Fig. 3a).
The RD superimposes well with a root mean square deviation of ~0.6 Å with the structures
of isolated RD bound to dsRNA with and without 5′-ppp8–10. However, the trajectory of the
RNA helix in the helicase-RD is different. Superposition of the three RD structures
demonstrates that the dsRNA bound to the isolated RD clashes with domain 3 (Fig 3d–e).
Thus, the dsRNA in helicase-RD is rotated and the previously reported contacts (R811,
K849, K851, and H871) between RD and RNA are no longer observed in the helicase-RD
structure.

It is proposed that RIG-I exists in an autoinhibited state18 in the absence of RNA with
undetectable ATPase activity (Table 1) and activates upon binding viral RNAs. SAXS,
limited proteolysis, and DSF were performed to gain insights into how RNA binding
activates RIG-I. Full-length RIG-I and helicase-RD undergo conformational changes and
exhibit greater stability upon RNA binding (Fig. 4). The radius of gyration (Rg) of helicaseRD and full-length RIG-I decreases upon dsRNA binding by 10 and 2.3 Å, respectively
(Supplementary Table 2), consistent with the results from size exclusion chromatography
(Supplemental Fig. 1b). The SAXS Kratky plots of helicase-RD and full-length RIG-I with
RNA are symmetrical parabolic curves (Supplemental Fig. 5), consistent with folded and
globular complexes. The parabolic shape of the Kratky plot is lost and the peak amplitude
decreases in the absence of RNA, indicative of greater flexibility19. Limited trypsin
digestion and DSF shows a greater stabilization with dsRNA and a small increase in stability
upon addition of the ATP analog (Fig. 4a–4b). These data suggest that RIG-I is composed of
globular domains connected with flexible linkers that become ordered upon RNA binding.
Such conformational stabilization upon ATP and RNA binding has been documented in
other helicases 20–22.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A model of full-length RIG-I bound to dsRNA was established from ab initio SAXS
envelope followed by rigid body refinement of helicase-RD•dsRNA complex and
homologous CARD structures (Supplementary Table 2, and Fig. 4c–4f). The helicaseRD•dsRNA complex and two copies of the CARD are accommodated in full-length RIG-I
SAXS envelope. The two CARDs project from domain 1. Such an orientation of the CARDs
would allow for interaction with downstream signaling factors23–28. Interestingly, the
second CARD is positioned adjacent to the V-shaped linker and close to the T770
phosphorylation site. The close proximity of the linker to the second CARD suggests a
possible mechanism where the two alpha helices may serve as a hinge for RD movement
upon RNA binding leading to RIG-I activation. The model suggests that the dsRNA extends
along a perpendicular axis relative to the CARDs and hence can accommodate multiple
RIG-I molecules29.

Method Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recombinant full-length RIG-I (1–925), helicase-RD (232–925), helicase (232–794), RD
(795–925), and selenomethione derivatized helicase-RD were expressed in Escherichia coli
and purified to homogeneity using immobilized metal ion affinity, hydroxyapatite and
heparin affinity chromatography. Fluorescence anisotropy titrations were performed at
25°C30 (λexcitation 494 nm and λemission 516 nm) using a fluorescein-labeled 14 base pair
dsRNA prepared by annealing 5′GGAGAGAACCGCCU and 3′CCUCUCUUGGCGGA-F
RNA, where F is fluorescein. Crystals of the native and selenomethione helicase-RD with
pal-dsRNA (5′CGACGCUAGCGUCG) and ADP•BeF3•Mg2+ were obtained in 25% (w/v)
PEG 3350, 0.25 M NaSCN, 100 mM MOPS (pH 7.8), 3% (v/v) 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol at
20°C by hanging drop. The crystals belong to space group P6522 with cell parameters
a=b=174.9 Å and c=110.9 Å. The structure was determined by SAD to 3.2 Å resolution and
refined against a 2.9 Å resolution native data set. The final model has an Rwork and Rfree of
0.199 and 0.287, respectively. SAXS measurements were preformed on full-length RIG-I
and helicase-RD in the absence and presence of dsRNA (5′GCGCGCGCGC). Buffer
subtraction and Rg were calculated from Guinier plots. Dmax was determined by scanning a
range of values and comparing experimental I(s) values to P(r) transforms. Ten ab initio
models were averaged and normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) values were calculated.
The helicase-RD•dsRNA and a homologous CARD structure were positioned into the ab
initio model and χ2 were determined.

Full Methods
Protein expression and purification

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All the protein constructs were expressed with an N-terminal 6xHis-SUMO fusion. Human
full-length RIG-I (1–925), helicase-RD (232–925), and helicase (232–794) were expressed
in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) as soluble proteins. The soluble fraction
of helicase-RD was purified from the cell lysate using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate (Qiagen)
column. The recovered protein was then digested with Ulp1 protease to remove the 6xHisSUMO tag and further purified by hydroxyapatite column (CHT-II, Bio-Rad) and heparin
sepharose column (GE Healthcare). Finally, purified helicase-RD was dialyzed against 50
mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol overnight at 4°C, snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The RIG-I RD (795–925) was expressed in
Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells and the soluble fraction was purified to homogeneity
using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate column, cation exchange (HiTrap SP, GE Healthcare) and gel
filtration chromatography. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled helicase-RD was produced in
Rosetta (DE3) cells grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 50 mg ml−1 L-SeMet
(Sigma) and specific amino acids to inhibit endogenous methionine synthesis. The SeMet
protein was purified using the same procedure as the unmodified protein.
Fluorescence anisotropy titrations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fluorescence anisotropy measurements31 were carried out on a Fluoro-Max-4
spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Fluorescein-labeled 14 base pair dsRNA
(Dharmacon) (10 nM) was titrated with full-length RIG-I, helicase domain, RD, or helicaseRD in 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), 100 mM Na-acetate, 10 mM Mg-acetate, 5% glycerol, 5
mM DTT, 0.05% Tween 20 buffer. 5′-ppp dsRNA (GGAGAGAACCGCCU) was
transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase, PAGE purified, and annealed to a complementary,
fluorescein-labeled RNA. Fluorescein anisotropy was measured at 25°C with excitation at
494 nm and emission at 516 nm. The helicase-RD titrations were also performed at lower
dsRNA concentrations (1 and 2 nM) to obtain an accurate Kd. The observed fluorescence
anisotropy (robs) as a function of protein concentration (Pt) was fit to equations 1 and 2 to
obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd.

Initial anisotropy of the free fluorescein-labeled dsRNA was 0.10 for all experiments. The
measurements and errors are from two independent experiments in Table 1.
ATPase activity
A time course (0–30 min) of the ATPase reaction was performed using RIG-I helicase-RD
(5 nM), ATP (1 mM) spiked with [γ-32P]ATP with and without 14 base pair dsRNA (80
nM) in buffer containing 50mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 5mM MgCl2, 5mM DTT, 0.01% Tween
20 at 37°C. The ATPase activity of the RIG-I helicase domain was measured using a higher
amount of protein (100 nM) and RNA (1 μM). The quenched reactions were analyzed by

PEI-Cellulose-F TLC (Merck) developed in 0.4 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 3.4). The
TLC plates were exposed to a phosphorimager plate, analyzed on a Typhoon phosphorimager, and quantified using ImageQuant software. The ATPase rate was determined from
the plots of [Pi] produced versus time and the rate constant values were calculated by
dividing the ATPase rate by the respective enzyme concentration. Mean rate constant from 2
independent measurements and range is shown in Table 1.
Analytical size-exclusion chromatography
Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was carried out on an AKTA FPLC system (GE
Healthcare). Proteins were loaded on to Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2,
5 mM DTT. The eluate was monitored by ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm. For the
complex, helicase-RD was incubated with 14 base pair dsRNA at the molar ratio of 1:1.2 on
ice for 15 min before the sample was applied onto the column.
Preparation of Helicase-RD•dsRNA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The palindrome RNA oligonucleotide (5′-CGACGCUAGCGUCG-3′) (Dharmacon) was
deprotected and desalted into 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) before use. The dsRNA
was prepared by incubating the RNA at 95 °C for 1 min followed by gradual cooling to 4
°C. The resulting dsRNA were mixed with purified helicase-RD in a RNA:protein molar
ratio of 1.2:1, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and then purified by size-exclusion
chromatography (Superdex200, GE Healthcare) with an elution buffer of 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2.
Crystallization and X-ray diffraction data collection

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Helicase-RD•dsRNA•ADP•BeF3 ternary complex was reconstituted by incubating 0.17 mM
helicase-RD with 0.17 mM dsRNA, 2 mM ADP, 2 mM BeCl2 and 10 mM NaF on ice for 30
min prior to crystallization. Crystals of native and SeMet-substituted complex were grown
by hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C. Aliquots (2.5 μl) of 15 mg ml−1 of
helicase-RD•dsRNA•ADP•BeF3 complex in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM
DTT, 5 mM MgCl2 were mixed with 2.5 μl of reservoir solution containing 25% (w/v) PEG
3350, 0.25 M NaSCN, 100 mM MOPS (pH 7.8), 3% (v/v) 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol. Crystals
appeared after 2–3 days, and they grew to a maximum size of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.5 mm over the
course of 8 days. 5-iodo-uridine derivative helicase-RD•dsRNA•ADP•BeF3 crystals were
grown under identical conditions. For cryogenic data collection, crystals were transferred
into crystallization solutions containing 5% (v/v) (2R,3R)-(−)-2,3-butanediol as
cryoprotectant and then flash-cooled at 100 K. SeMet single-wavelength anomalous
dispersion (SAD) dataset was collected at the X29A beam line of the National Synchrotron
Light Source (NSLS). Native data set was recorded at the LRL-CAT 31-ID beam line of the
Advanced Photon Source (APS). Data from iodouridine derivative crystals were collected at
the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) F1 beam line. All diffraction data
were integrated using iMosfilm and scaled in SCALA32.
Structure determination and refinement
Phases were determined using the SAD method. SHELXD/HKL2MAP33 detected a total of
12 out of 14 possible selenium sites in the asymmetric unit. Initial phases were calculated
with Phaser32 and followed by density modification by DM32. Phase extension to 3.2 Å by
SOLOMON32 produced an electron-density map into which most of the protein and RNA
residues could be built unambiguously. The model was built using COOT34 and refined in
PHENIX35. The final model, comprising ADP•BeF3, 12 base pair dsRNA, RIG-I residues
240–495, 504–522, 527–687, and 690–923 has Rwork and Rfree values of 0.199 and 0.287,

respectively. Model validation demonstrated no outliers and 90% of the residues located the
most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot35. Statistics of the data processing and
structure refinement are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
Small angle X-ray scattering and structural modeling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

SAXS data were collected at the CHESS beamline G1 using a Finger Lakes CCD X-ray
detector with a sample-to-detector distance 1450mm, covering the range of scattering
vectors 0.01 < s < 0.233 Å −1, where s= 4πsinθ/λ (2θ is the scattering angle and λ= 1.296
Å). All samples were buffer exchanged into 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM
DTT, 5% glycerol by size exclusion chromatography (Hiload 16/26 Superdex200, GE
Healthcare) to minimize the discrepancies in background subtraction. SAXS data was
reduced using Data Squeeze. Various programs in ATSAS software package were used to
process and evaluate the scattering data. Radius of gyration (Rg) was analyzed using the
Guinier approximation with low angle data (s < 1.3/Rg) using PRIMUS36. The residuals
from the Guinier plots did not show signs of protein aggregation. The probability
distribution of distances between scattering atoms within the macromolecule, P(r), and the
maximum atom pair distance, Dmax, were determined from the scattering data using the
GNOM algorithm37. The program DAMMIF38 was used to calculate low-resolution ab
initio reconstructions from experimental SAXS profiles. Ten to twenty independent models
were aligned, filtered, and averaged based on the occupancy using SUPCOMB and
DAMAVER39 to reconstruct the final ab initio envelope, as judged by averaged normalized
spatial discrepancies (NSD) less than 1.0. The structure modeling was refined against the
solution scattering data by rigid body docking using SASREF program40. The orientation
and position of individual domains in the structure models were further manually adjusted to
minimize the discrepancies (χ2) between the calculated scattering intensities and
experimental scattering intensities computed using program CRYSOL41. Kratky plots were
calculated using PRIMUS36.
Differential scanning fluorimetry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Thermal shift assay was conducted with 10 μM of RIG-I helicase-RD or full-length RIG-I
with or without 12 μM of 14 base pair pal-dsRNA and/or 2 mM ADP•BeF3 in 50 mM
HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, and a 5x dilution of SYPRO
Orange dye (Invitrogen) as described42. The fluorescence signal as a function of temperature
was recorded using a Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). The temperature
gradient is performed in the range of 25–80°C with a ramp of 0.2°C over the course of 60
minutes. Control assays were carried out with buffer in the presence or absence of RNA.
Data were analyzed with the Excel-based worksheet DSF analysis, and Boltzmann model
was used to fit the fluorescence data to obtain the midpoint temperature for the thermal
protein unfolding transition (Tm) using the curve-fitting software Prism.
Limited trypsin proteolysis
Limited proteolysis with trypsin (Roche) was performed using 120 μg of purified full-length
RIG-I or helicase-RD in the absence or presence of pal-dsRNA and incubated with trypsin at
a protein:protease mass ratio of 300:1. The reaction mixtures were maintained at room
temperature and aliquots were removed at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
