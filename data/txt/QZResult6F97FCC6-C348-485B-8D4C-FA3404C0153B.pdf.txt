ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer is the most common urologic malignancy in China, with an increase
of the incidence and mortality rates over past decades. Recent studies suggest that
bladder tumors are maintained by a rare fraction of cells with stem cell proprieties.
Targeting these bladder tumor initiating cell (TICs) population can overcome the drugresistance of bladder cancer. However, the molecular and genetic mechanisms regulating
TICs in bladder cancer remain poorly defined. Jarid2 is implicated in signaling pathways
regulating cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and stem cell maintenance. The
goal of our study was to examine whether Jarid2 plays a role in the regulation of TICs
in bladder cancer. We found that knockdown of Jarid2 was able to inhibit the invasive
ability and sphere-forming capacity in bladder cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of
Jarid2 reduced the proportion of TICs and impaired the tumorigenicity of bladder cancer
TICs in vivo. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of Jarid2 promoted the invasive ability
and sphere-forming capacity in bladder cancer cells. Mechanistically, reduced Jarid2
expression led to the upregulation of p16 and H3K27me3 level at p16 promoter region.
Collectively, we provided evidence that Jarid2 via modulation of p16 is a putative novel
therapeutic target for treating malignant bladder cancer.

INTRODUCTION

differ from non-TIC cancer cells and how TICs contribute
to relapse and resistance will support the development
of effective therapeutics against bladder cancer. Several
markers, such as ALDH activity, expression of Bmi1 and
Sox2, are commonly used as markers in identification
and characterization of TICs in bladder cancer [3–5].
However, the molecular features of TICs in bladder cancer
remain poorly defined.

Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers
among males, and its high mortality mirrors problems
with aggressiveness and drug-resistance [1]. In a variety
of solid tumors, tumor-initiating cells (TICs) have been
implicated in therapeutic resistance and relapse after initial
therapy [2]. Hence, better understanding of how TICs

Jarid2 belongs to AT-rich interaction domain
containing (ARID) gene family, which can modify
chromatin structure through DNA binding and regulate
targeted gene transcription. ARID gene family plays
important roles in cancer-related signaling pathways and
are highly mutated or differentially expressed in cancer
cells [6]. Jarid2 also contains a Jumonji domain but
lacks histone demethylase activity. Jarid2 can interact
with Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) to regulate
the maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation of
embryonic stem cells [7–9], suggesting a function of
Jarid2 in stem cell biology. Study has also shown that
Jarid2 is required TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) through repression of CDH1 and
miR-200 family genes in lung and colon cancers [10].
In addition, JARID2 positively mediates EMT of
hepatocellular carcinoma via PTEN/AKT signaling [11],
indicating a role of Jarid2 in the metastatic property of
cancer cells. However, the roles of Jarid2 in bladder
cancer cells have remained elusive.
In current study, we have analyzed the expression
of ARID gene family in TICs of bladder cancer cell lines.
We have characterized the role of Jarid2 over cell invasion,
sphere-forming ability of bladder cancer and tumorigenicity
of TICs. Furthermore, we have studied the effect of Jarid2
on the expression of p16, a known PRC1/2 target gene.

regulated or over-expressed Jarid2 (Figure 2A, 2B). We
detected no significant difference in cell proliferation
in control and Jarid2 knocked down in both cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 1). However, invasion and sphereforming experiments showed that down-regulation of
Jarid2 significantly inhibited cell invasion and sphereforming ability in both cell lines (Figure 2C–2F).
Conversely, when Jarid2-Flag plasmid was transfected
into the 5637 and SCaBER cell lines, invasion and sphere
formation data showed the opposite results (Figure 3A–3F).
In summary, our data indicated that Jarid2 expression was
positively associated with bladder cancer cell invasion and
sphere-forming ability in vitro.

Jarid2 knockdown reduces ALDH activity and
tumorigenicity of bladder cancer cell
To examine the function of Jarid2 in the ALDH
activity and tumorigenicity of bladder cancer cells, we
obtained stable bladder cell lines with lentivirus-mediated
shRNA knockdown of Jarid2 compared with control cells
expressing shGFP (Figure 4A, 4B). The control 5637 and
SCaBER cells contained 7.5% and 15.3% ALDHhigh cells,
respectively, which were comparable with their uninfected
parental cells (Figure 1A and Figure 3C). In contrast, we
only detected 2.4% and 5.8% ALDHhigh cells in Jarid2sh 5637 and SCaBER cells, respectively (Figure 3C),
suggesting that the Jarid2 is necessary for ALDH activity
in bladder cancer cells in vitro. To examine whether Jarid2
is critical for the tumorigenicity of bladder cancer TICs
in vivo, we performed limiting dilutions (100, 500, 2500,
1 × 104 and 1 × 105) of ALDHhigh cell sorted from stable
Jarid2-sh 5637 and SCaBER cells. As shown in Figure 4D,
fewer tumors formed in Jarid2-sh cells compared to
control cells when 105 or 104 cells were implanted. In
contrast, no tumors formed in the 5637 cells with silencing
of Jarid2-sh when 100, 500, 2500 cells were injected (0/4),
while tumors still formed in control injections (Figure 4D).
These results combined, support the sphere-forming data,
suggesting that Jarid2 is required for the maintenance of
the stem cell population in bladder cancer.

RESULTS
Jarid2 is enriched in TICs of bladder cancer
We first isolated TICs based on ALDH activity in
two bladder cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry demonstrated
heterogeneous ALDH activity among different bladder
cancer cell lines with 7.8% ALDHhigh cells in 5637 cell line
relative to DEAB control samples, whereas 15.8% ALDHhigh
cells were isolated from SCaBER cell line (Figure 1A).
We next evaluated ALDHhigh and ALDHlow cell populations
for expression of ARID gene family. For the expression
other ARID gene family members, we did not observe any
significant changes (Figure 1B). However, JARID2 expression
was shown clearly increased in ALDHhigh cells from both cell
lines (Figure 1C). Next, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
data were accessed and analyzed via the eBioPortal for Cancer
Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org) for the alteration of
Jarid2 expression in 412 bladder cancer patients. As shown in
Figure 1C, the expression of Jarid2 is altered in 51 out of 412
cases (12.3%). Together, our results suggest that Jarid2 might
play a role in the regulation of TICs in bladder cancer.

Jarid2 inhibits the expression of p16 in TICs
p16INK4a, a known tumor suppressor which is
epigenetically repressed by PRC2 and PRC1, can
induce senescence and depletion of stem cells [12, 13].
Loss of Jarid2 in embryonic stem cells dramatically
inhibits binding of the PRC2 to their target genes [14].
Interestingly, our results showed the level of p16INK4a
transcript and protein was up-regulated in both Jarid2-sh
bladder cancer cell lines (Figure 4B and 4E). ChIP assay
results from 5637 cells showed Jarid2-sh cells had reduced
levels of Jarid2 and H3K27me3 in the promoter region of
p16INK4a (Figure 4F, 4G). In summary, Jarid2 can localize
to the promoter region of p16INK4a and is required for
H3K27me3 modification of this region.

Jarid2 expression was positively associated with
bladder cancer cell invasion and sphere-forming
ability

DISCUSSION

Jarid2 can be associated with PRC1/2 and acts as a
transcriptional repressor in embryonic stem cells [14, 16].
Jarid2 facilitates the recruitment of the PRC1/2 complex
to target genes and plays a critical role in regulating gene
expression during embryonic development [7, 17].
Functionally, we found Jarid2 is required for the
invasive ability and sphere-forming capacity in bladder
cancer cells. Silencing of Jarid2 also decreased the
percentage of TICs and inhibited the tumorigenicity of
bladder cancer TICs. Complementarily, forced expression
of Jarid2 promoted the invasive ability and sphere-forming
capacity in bladder cancer cells. In lung and colon cancer,

Bladder cancer is the fourth most common
malignancy in men. The 5-year survival rate of bladder
cancer patients ranges between 40% and 60% and has
not been improved in the last decade. It is becoming
increasingly clear that TICs in tumors cannot be eradicated
by traditional chemotherapy, which causes the tumor
recurrence and poor survival [15]. In this study, we found
that Jarid2 was enriched in the TICs of two bladder cancer
cell lines. Jarid2 gene encodes a protein that contains a
Jumonji- and AT-rich interaction domain (ARID)-domain.

Moreover, JARID2 can regulate cell migration, invasion,
proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma

by repressing expression of tumor suppressor gene PTEN
via increasing H3K27me3 level at PTEN promoter
region [11]. Consistently, our data showed that reduced

Supplementary Materials.

Cell proliferation and invasion assays

Limiting dilution tumorigenic assay

For proliferation assay, 2.5 × 103 5637 or SCaBER
cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Cell proliferation
was measured every day for 6 days by an MTT
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the
manufacturer’s guidance. For invasion assay, 200 μl of
5 × 105 bladder cancer cells were seeded in triplicate 24-well
transwell chambers coated with matrigel (EMD Millipore).
The cells were plated in medium without serum. The lower
chamber was filled with 600 μl conditioned medium (DMEM
medium containing 1% FBS for 24 h) as chemoattractant.
After 24 h incubation, the cells invaded to the lower
surface of the filter were fixed with methanol, stained with
hematoxylin and quantified by six random fields of view.

To perform limiting dilutions (100, 500, 2500,
1 × 104 and 1 × 105) of ALDHhigh cell sorted from stable
Jarid2-sh 5637 and SCaBER cells, we mixed cells with
Matrigel (BD biosciences) (1:1) and subcutaneously
injected to nude mice. The animals injected with cancer
cells were euthanized after 10 weeks.

Statistics
All experiments were repeated at least three times,
and the data were analyzed using the SPSS 12.0 statistical
software package (SPSS, Inc.). Student’s t-test was used
to comparing the means of two samples. A value of p less
than 0.05 (*P < 0.05) was regarded statistically significant.
Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation.

RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR

CONCLUSIONS

Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, China) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. The real-time quantitative
PCR reaction was performed as previously described
[20, 21]. The relative expression of target transcripts was
normalized against that of β-actin. The primers for these
transcripts are listed in Supplementary Materials.

These results suggested that Jarid2 acted upon p16
to regulate stem-cell-property in TICs of bladder cancer.
Collectively, the data indicate that Jarid2 is an essential
regulator in bladder cancer cells and can be used as a
novel therapeutic target in the treatment of the disease.
