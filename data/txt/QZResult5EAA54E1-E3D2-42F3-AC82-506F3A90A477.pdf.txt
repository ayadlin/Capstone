Abstract
The Dachshund (dac) gene, initially cloned as a dominant
inhibitor of the Drosophila hyperactive EGFR mutant ellipse,
encodes a key component of the cell fate determination
pathway involved in Drosophila eye development. Analysis of
more than 2,200 breast cancer samples showed improved
survival by some 40 months in patients whose tumors
expressed DACH1. Herein, DACH1 and estrogen receptor-A
(ERA) expressions were inversely correlated in human breast
cancer. DACH1 bound and inhibited ERA function. Nuclear
DACH1 expression inhibited estradiol (E2)-induced DNA
synthesis and cellular proliferation. DACH1 bound ERA in
immunoprecipitation-Western blotting, associated with ERA
in chromatin immunoprecipitation, and inhibited ERA transcriptional activity, requiring a conserved DS domain.
Proteomic analysis identified proline, glutamic acid, and
leucine rich protein 1 (PELP1) as a DACH1-binding protein.
The DACH1 COOH terminus was required for binding to
PELP1. DACH1 inhibited induction of ERA signaling. E2
recruited ERA and disengaged corepressors from DACH1 at
an endogenous ER response element, allowing PELP1 to serve
as an ERA coactivator. DACH1 expression, which is lost in
poor prognosis human breast cancer, functions as an
endogenous inhibitor of ERA function. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Estrogen receptor a (ERa) plays a major role in regulating the
growth, survival, and differentiation of normal and malignant
breast epithelial cells. ERa is overexpressed in 60% to 80% of
human breast cancers, with f70% of patients responding to
endocrine treatments (1, 2). The ERa encodes a modular nuclear
receptor with an NH2-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1), a
COOH-terminal activation function 2 (AF-2), and a conserved
ligand-binding domain within the COOH terminus. The ligandbound receptor dimerizes and binds to ER response elements

(ERE) in the promoter region of target genes. ERa can, via distinct
cognate transcription factors (activator protein-1, nuclear factornB, SP-1, and FKHR), bind to alternate DNA sequences (3, 4). In
addition to the predominantly nuclear location, ERa is located in
the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and mitochondria (5–8).
ERa participates in nongenomic (cytoplasmic and membranemediated) signaling via a multiprotein complex, which includes the
ERa, Src kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHC, and G proteins
(3). Estrogen-mediated induction of cell survival and proliferation
induces AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase, which in turn
can phosphorylate the ERa and its coregulators (9). Estrogen
antagonists are widely used and represent an effective treatment
for ERa-positive breast cancers. Antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen,
inhibit estrogen binding to the ERa, whereas fulvestrant (ICI 182,
780, Faslodex) blocks dimerization (10) and reduces ERa protein
abundance. Current therapies fail a proportion of patients who at
initial diagnosis express ERa (de novo resistance) and the majority
of patients who eventually become resistant (acquired resistance;
refs. 11, 12). A continued role for ERa in most resistant tumors is
underscored by the finding that most resistant tumors remain ERa
positive. The identification of endogenous inhibitors of ERa in
human breast cancer may provide alternative therapeutic targets
for ERa-positive breast cancers that are resistant to current
treatments.
Steroid receptor coactivators and corepressors interact with the
ERa to regulate target gene expression and estradiol (E2)dependent biological effects (13). ERa corepressors encode, or
are associated with, histone deacetylases (HDAC). A number of
ERa coactivator and corepressor proteins are dysregulated in
human breast cancer, which may contribute to altered cellular
growth or therapeutic resistance (14, 15). Coactivators include the
cointegrator proteins (p300/CREB binding protein); the steroid
receptor coactivation proteins; and chromatin remodeling recruitment scaffolds such as proline, glutamic acid, and leucine rich
protein 1 (PELP1). Initially cloned as an ERa coactivator (16),
PELP1 encodes a proline-rich protein with interaction motifs that
bind to FHA, SH2, SH3, PDZ, and WW domains and encodes
nuclear receptor interacting boxes (LXXLL) that enable interaction
with multiple nuclear receptors. Estrogen promotes PELP1
expression and PELP1 interaction with the AF-2 domain of ERa
through the LXXLL motifs 4 and 5 of PELP1 (16–18). PELP1 is
expressed in a variety of tissues including the breast, with the
highest expression found in the mammary gland during pregnancy.
Recent studies of more than 2,200 human breast cancer
samples showed that the reduction in abundance of a cell fate

determination factor, DACH1, correlated with poor prognosis (19).
Initially cloned in a screen for antagonists of the Drosophila
hyperactive EGFR mutation ellipse (20), the dac gene is sufficient to
induce ectopic eye formation (21). The human orthologue, DACH1
gene, encodes a cell fate determination protein with domains
homologous to the Sno/Ski oncogenes. Dac functions in a complex
regulatory network [Retinal Determination Gene Network (RDGN)]
of genes including the twin of eyeless (toy), eyeless (ey), sin oculis
(so), and eyes absent (eya) gene complex (22). The RDGN governs
organismal fate in metazoans, including retinal, muscle, and
gonodal development (23).
In view of the finding that DACH1 expression is lost during
progression of human breast cancer correlating with poor
prognosis, and that ERa plays a key role in human breast cancer
progression, we examined the interaction between DACH1 and
estrogen signaling. DACH1 physically interacted with and
inhibited ligand-dependent ERa activity. DACH1 inhibited ligand-dependent, ERa-mediated cellular proliferation and DNA
synthesis. Through a proteomic analysis and direct sequencing,
the ERa coregulator PELP1 was identified as a DACH1-binding
PELP1 associated with DACH1 in an intranuclear/extranucleolar
distribution and reverted DACH1-mediated ERa repression. With
the DACH1 gene shown to encode a key component of the RDGN
signaling network, these studies provide the first evidence for
interaction between the RDGN network and hormone signaling in
mammalian cells.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid constructions. The expression plasmids, which include an
NH2-terminal FLAG peptide for DACH1, DACH1 DS-domain alone (DS), or
DACH1 DS-domain deleted (DDS), were previously described (24). The
FLAG-tagged DACH1 cDNA was subcloned into the vector MSCV-IRES-GFP.
The expression vector encoding wild-type (wt) and mutant ERa (25) and
PELP1 (26, 27) mutants were previously described.
Cell culture, DNA transfection, and luciferase assays. Cell culture,
DNA transfection, and luciferase assays were done as previously described
(28–30). Cells were plated at a density of 1  105 cells in a 24-well plate on
the day before transfection with EasyTransgator according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (America Pharma Source). Luciferase activity was
normalized for transfection efficiency using a h-galactosidase reporter as an
internal control. Statistical analyses were done using the Mann-Whitney
U test.
Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays. Western blotting for
DACH1 (M2), FLAG tag (Sigma), and the loading control guanine
dissociation inhibitor was conducted as previously described (24, 31).
HEK293T cells were used for the detection of protein-protein interactions
and immunoprecipitation was conducted as previously described using
anti-FLAG–coated M2 beads. Immunoblotting was conducted with antibodies to ERa (H-184; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and DACH1 (Abcam).
HEK293T cells were cotransfected with 3xFLAG-ERa and T7-PELP1 in a
10-cm cell culture dish with 70% cell confluency. Five hours after
transfection, cells were treated with either E2 (10 nmol/L) or vehicle for
24 h. Cell lysates were prepared using TBS-T buffer [50 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
DTT, and proteinase inhibitors]. Immunoprecipitation was done on 1 mg of
the whole-cell lysates using 30 AL of FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). 6xHISDACH1 proteins purified from bacteria were added to the immunoprecipitation reaction at increasing dose as indicated in the figure. The
immunoprecipitate was resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gel. Western blot was
conducted using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for ERa and T7 antibody
(Bethyl Laboratories) for PELP1.
[3H]Thymidine uptake. [3H]Thymidine uptake was done as previously
described (32). MCF-7 cells stably infected with either MSCV-IRES-GFP or

www.aacrjournals.org

MSCV-IRES-DACH1-GFP were plated in triplicate in 24-well plates in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 penicillin/
streptomycin. Cells were allowed to attach overnight, after which medium
was switched to phenol red–free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal
stripped fetal bovine serum, 1 penicillin/streptomycin for 24 h. Cells at
f70% confluency were treated with E2 (10 nmol/L) or vehicle 7 h, after
which cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine for an additional 2 h (2.0 ACi/
well). Cells were washed with cold PBS, and proteins precipitated with
10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 37jC (100 AL/well). Precipitation
was followed by additional washing with 10% trichloroacetic acid, after
which cells were treated with 0.2 N NaOH and collected in scintillation
vials. Radioactivity was read using a Wallac 1209 Rackbeta liquid
scintillation counter.
Immunohistochemistry. To analyze the coexpression of DACH1 and
ERa in human breast tissue, microarrays were constructed from paraffinembedded tissues using the Cutting Edge Matrix Assembly technique (33)
and consisted of 140 invasive ductal carcinomas and 40 normal breast
tissues. Immunohistochemistry was conducted as described (2) using
antibodies specific for DACH1 (Abcam) and ERa (DAKO). Immunofluorescent images were taken using a PM2000 microscope (HistoRX; magnification, 60). These images were then analyzed for intensity of DACH1 and
ERa expression in human breast epithelial cells using the Image J program
(NIH) to quantify expression in each single cell with an image of breast
tissue. These data were then graphically represented using the GraphPad
Prism version 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). This study did not
need approval from the Institutional Review Board, Thomas Jefferson
University, as the human breast tissue was more than 10 y old.
Confocal microscopy. Cells grown in four-well chamber slides were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at the room temperature.
The slides were rinsed with PBS and permeated with 0.05% NP40. The
primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-T7 for PELP1 (Bethel
Laboratory) and rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG. The secondary antibodies
used were Alexa Fluor 633–conjugated F(ab¶)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse
IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.; 1/250) and rhodamine red X–conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab; 1/50). Fluorescence confocal
imaging was acquired with a 63 objective of a Zeiss 510 Meta laser confocal
microscope. The images were processed with MetaMorph (Molecular
Devices).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis was done following a protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology
under modified conditions (34). MCF-7 cells (1  106) were grown in DMEM
with 10% charcoal dextran-stripped serum for 3 d. Cells were treated with
E2 for the time points indicated in the figure legends (45 min, 1 h, 12 h).
On E2 (100 nmol/L) stimulation, the cells were cross-linked by directly
adding 1.1% formaldehyde buffer containing 100 mmol/L sodium chloride,
1 mmol/L EDTA-Na (pH 8.0), 0.5 mmol/L EGTA-Na, Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to
culture medium for 10 min at 37jC. The medium was aspirated; cells were
washed thrice using ice-cold PBS containing 10 mmol/L DTT and protease
inhibitors, lysed in warm 1% SDS lysis buffer, and incubated for 10 min on
ice. The cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between
200 and 1,000 bp and the samples were diluted 10-fold in chromatin
immunoprecipitation dilution buffer. To reduce nonspecific background,
the cell pellet suspension was precleared with 60 AL of salmon sperm DNA/
protein A agarose-50% slurry (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4jC
with agitation. The following primers were used for PCR of the pS2
promoter: sense, 5¶-GGCCATCTCTCACTATGAATCACTTCTGC-3¶; antisense, 3¶-GCAGAAGTGATTCATAGTGAGAGATGGCC-5¶.
In-gel trypsin digestion. Gels were stained with Coomassie G-250 to
visualize proteins. To identify DACH1-associated proteins, direct sequencing of coprecipitated proteins was conducted. All surfaces and utensils were
cleaned with methanol/water. Inside a chemical hood, one-dimensional
SDS-PAGE gel bands were cut from the gel and then diced into small pieces
(f1 mm3) and put into microcentrifuge tubes. Ammonium bicarbonate
(25 mmol/L)/50% acetonitrile was added to the tubes to cover the pieces
and incubated for 10 min with periodic vortexing. The supernatant was
removed and discarded. These two steps were repeated until the Coomassie
stain was removed. Acetonitrile (100%) was added to each tube to cover the

discarded, and the gel pieces were allowed to dry in the chemical hood.
Twenty-five microliters of 10 mmol/L DTT in 25 mmol/L ammonium
bicarbonate were added to each tube, vortexed, and then spun. The
gel pieces were then incubated at 56jC for 1 h. The supernatant was
removed and 25 AL of iodoacetamide were added to the gel pieces,
vortexed, and then spun. The gel pieces were incubated for 45 min in
the dark at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and
discarded. Acetonitrile (100%) was added to cover the gel pieces and
then incubated for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and
discarded and the gel pieces were dried in the chemical hood. Just
before use, sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) was diluted
to 20 mg/mL and kept on ice. Trypsin was added to cover the gel
pieces and incubated for 30 min on ice. After incubation and gel
swelling, excess trypsin was removed and then 20 mmol/L ammonium
bicarbonate was added to cover the gel pieces. The gel pieces were
incubated 16 to 24 h at 37jC. The digest solution was transferred to
clean microcentrifuged tubes, after which 50% acetonitrile/5% formic
acid was added to cover the gel pieces. The gel pieces were incubated

for 30 min and the supernatant was added to the previously collected
digest solution. The collected digest solution was dried using a speed
vacuum, resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by mass
spectrometry (MS).
MS analysis. Mass spectra were acquired using an Applied Biosystems
model 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF and 4000 Series Explorer software (version
3.5.1). Mass spectra at m/z 800 to 4,000 were acquired for each digested
one-dimensional SDS-PAGE band using 1,000 laser shots. MS/MS spectra
were derived from up to 2,000 laser shots depending on the fragmentation
of the precursor ion. Fragmentation of the precursor ions was induced by
the use of atmosphere as a collision gas with a pressure of 1  10 6 Torr
and in MS/MS 2 kV mode. For peak detection, cluster area S/N optimization
using a S/N threshold value of 30 was selected.
Peptide identifications. Peptide identifications were done using the
MASCOT search engine (version 1.9, Matrix Science) via GPS Explorer
(version 3.6). Each MS/MS spectrum was searched against the National
Center for Biotechnology Information number database of human protein
sequences. Protein identifications with confidence interval scores of >95%
were retained. The MASCOT search parameters were as follows: methionine

oxidation and carbamidomethylation were selected as variable modifications; 1 missed cleavage was allowed; precursor error tolerance of 100 ppm
and MS/MS fragment tolerance of 0.3 Da were selected; and charge was
set to +1.

Results
Analyses of DACH1 and ERa abundance were conducted on
normal and tumorous human breast samples. Cellular quantitative
immunohistochemical staining was conducted using the AQUA-PM
2000 platform on human breast cancer samples (Fig. 1A).
ERa expression was lost or reduced in DACH1-expressing breast
cancer epithelial cells. In normal breast tissue, DACH1 localized in
the nucleolus, whereas in breast cancer samples, DACH1 localized
diffusely within either the nucleus or cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). Analysis
of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and early invasive breast cancer
showed that nucleolar DACH1 distribution was lost in early
invasive breast cancer (Fig. 1C and D). ERa expression levels were
inversely correlated with DACH1 expression levels in breast cancer
samples (Fig. 1C). Although the relative abundance of DACH1 was
reduced in many of the breast cancer samples, further immunohistochemical staining of f2,000 breast cancer samples identified
either nuclear or cytoplasmic DACH1 in 7% and 50%, respectively,
of the samples. DACH1 expression (cytoplasmic) correlated
inversely with ERa expression (data not shown).

In view of the overall inverse correlation between ERa and
DACH1 expression in patients with breast cancer, we investigated
the functional interactions between the two proteins. Immunoprecipitation-Western blotting was conducted to examine the physical
interaction between ERa and DACH1. Cells were cotransfected
with expression vectors encoding ERa and an NH2-terminal FLAG
epitope–tagged DACH1. Immunoprecipitation was conducted with
an antibody to the FLAG epitope of the DACH1 protein and
Western blotting was conducted with an antibody directed to the
ERa. ERa wt bound to DACH1 wt in immunoprecipitation-Western
blot analysis (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Addition of E2 induced a modest
increase in DACH1-associated ERa.
To analyze the domains of DACH1 required for binding to the
ERa, a series of DACH1 mutants were transiently transfected with
the wt ERa into HEK293T cells. The DS domain is known to bind
HDAC3 and contribute to repression of c-Jun (32). Immunoprecipitation assays directed toward the DACH1 FLAG epitope
coprecipitated with ERa (Fig. 2A). Deletion of the DACH1 DS
domain did not reduce ERa binding; however, deletion of the
DACH1 COOH terminus abolished DACH1-ERa binding (Fig. 2A).
To determine the domains of the ERa required for binding to
DACH1, four fragments that cover the full length of ERa were fused
with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Equal amounts of GST
proteins were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled DACH1
(Fig. 2B). The ERa 282–337 domain is required for binding DACH1.

needed for the interaction with DACH1.

MSCV-iRES-GFP-DACH1 or control.

This domain of ERa is known to undergo posttranslational
modification by acetylation, which can alter the binding affinity
for coactivator and corepressor proteins (14, 25).
E2 enhanced the ERa luciferase reporter activity f20-fold
(Fig. 3A, left). The expression of DACH1 inhibited ligand-dependent
ERa activity by f60% (Fig. 3A, left) and deletion of the conserved
DS domain abrogated repression of ERa activity (Fig. 3A, right).
E2 induces DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were stably
transfected with either MSCV-IRES-GFP or MSCV-IRES-DACH1GFP. Control MCF-7 cells treated with E2 (10 nmol/L) for 9 hours
showed a 2-fold induction of DNA synthesis, measured by
[3H]thymidine uptake, consistent with prior studies (35). DACH1
expression in MCF-7 cells decreased both basal and ligand-induced
DNA synthesis (Fig. 3B). To further validate the effect of DACH1 on
ERa activity, the pS2-Luc promoter reporter gene was used in
MCF-7 cells transfected with DACH1. The pS2 gene was induced by
ERa activity. Expression of DACH1 in MCF-7 cells inhibited the
promoter activity of a 1-kb pS2 estrogen-responsive promoter
fragment (Fig. 3C, left). These findings are consistent with prior

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

published studies in which the E2-responsive cyclin D1 gene was
induced by shRNA to DACH1 in MCF-7 cells (19, 36). DACH1
expression inhibited E2-dependent induction of the endogenous
pS2 gene (Fig. 3C, right). DACH1 expression was verified by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown).
DACH1 inhibited ERE reporter gene activity and inhibited both
E2-induced and basal DNA synthesis. DACH1 has been shown to
inhibit basal level expression of c-jun (37) and cyclin D1 (19).
Because cyclin D1 and c-jun have both been shown to enhance
basal DNA synthesis in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines,
DACH1 repression of these proteins likely also contributes to the
inhibition of basal DNA synthesis. The pS2 minimal ERE reporter
was examined in the presence of E2 or the E2 antagonist ICI 182,
780. The E2 antagonist reduced E2-induced pS2 reporter activity by
80%, and additional ICI 182, 780 reduced activity a further 10%
(Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that basal ERE reporter activity
may reflect low levels of agonist-bound ERa activity.
ERa activity is modulated by coactivators and corepressors,
which modulate local chromatin structure (13). To investigate the

possibility that DACH1 physically associated with ERa coregulators, FLAG-tagged DACH1 was used as a molecular probe to
identify co-associated proteins. Cell extracts were prepared and a
high-flow-through anti-FLAG column was used to bind DACH1.
3xFLAG peptide was used to elute DACH1 and DACH1-associated
proteins. The proteins of interest were excised and analyzed by
MALDI MS/MS with subsequent analysis by peptide sequencing.
The analysis showed the presence of a prominent band with a
molecular weight of f160 kDa (Fig. 4A). Western blotting using
an antibody to FLAG showed the presence of DACH1 in the
97-kDa peak. Peptide sequence analysis identified the f160-kDa
(DACH1-associated) protein as PELP1. The physical association
between PELP1 and DACH1 was further assessed by immunoprecipitation-Western blotting. Expression vectors encoding PELP1

and DACH1 or a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of DACH1
were transduced into HEK293T cells. PELP1 was identified by
Western blotting in the DACH1 immunoprecipitation, but was not
present in the cells transduced with PELP1 and the DACH1
construct deleted of the COOH terminus (Fig. 4B). To identify
the domains of PELP1 required for the association with DACH1,
series of PELP1 mutants were transfected into HEK293T cells and
immunoprecipitation-Western blotting was conducted. The mean
data from immunoprecipitation-Western blots were tabulated
and a representative example is shown (Fig. 4C). Thus, DACH1
association requires a region of PELP1 at amino acids 400 to 600.
Immunohistochemical analysis identified DACH1 and PELP1
as colocalized in an intranuclear, extranucleolar distribution
(Fig. 4D).

immunoprecipitation analysis showed that PELP1 shRNA did not
affect the basal abundance of HDAC1 at the ERE. The E2-mediated
reduction in HDAC1 occupancy was, however, reduced by PELP1
shRNA. Thus, PELP1 shRNA increased HDAC1 occupancy at an ERE
in the presence of E2 (Fig. 6B, line 7 versus line 8).
To further examine the functional interaction between PELP1 and
DACH1 at an ERE, a luciferase reporter gene was deployed. DACH1
repressed the transcription of the estrogen-responsive pS2 gene by f3
fold. E2 enhanced ERE luciferase activity and cotransfection of PELP1
enhanced ERE activity in the presence of ligand (Fig. 6C). DACH1
repression of ERE activity was abrogated by coexpression of PELP1.
Collectively, these studies are consistent with a model in which
DACH1 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of ERa function and
transcriptional activity. DACH1 physically associates with PELP1
through the COOH terminus of DACH1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
In the presence of E2, the DACH1-associated repressor complex
dissociates from the endogenous ERa, resulting in an ERa/PELP1
coactivator complex and the induction of estrogen-dependent gene
expression (Fig. 6D).

Figure 5. DACH1 competes with PELP1 at ERa in the presence of ligand.
A, in vitro translated 35S-labeled DACH1, PELP1, and ERa were incubated in the
presence of E2 (10 8 mol/L) or control followed by immunoprecipitation using
the Myc and T7 antibodies. DACH1 associates in vitro with PELP1 and ERa.
B, the ERa immunoprecipitate (FLAG, M2 IP ) coprecipitates PELP1. The ERa
immunoprecipitate was coincubated with increasing amounts of bacterially
purified DACH (HIS-DACH1 ) and then electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE.
Western blot was done with the antibodies as indicated to show the relative
abundance of PELP1 bound to ERa in the presence of increasing amounts
of DACH1.

To further examine the direct binding of DACH1 to ERa and
PELP1, in vitro translated 35S-labeled Myc-DACH1 and ERa were
incubated in the presence of E2 or vehicle and immunoprecipitated
with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 5A). DACH1 directly bound ERa.
In the same assay, in vitro translated 35S-labeled T7-PELP1 was
used to confirm direct binding between DACH1 and PELP1
(Fig. 5A). To examine further the interaction between ERa, PELP1,
and DACH1, HEK293T cells were transfected with T7-tagged
PELP1 and 3xFLAG-tagged ERa. Immunoprecipitation was done
on 1 mg of whole-cell lysates using 30 AL of FLAG affinity gel.
6xHIS-DACH1 protein purified from bacteria was added to the
immunoprecipitation reaction at increasing dose (0–5 Ag).
Increasing amounts of DACH1 in the presence of 10 nmol/L E2
caused a dissociation of PELP1 from ERa (Fig. 5B).
To determine the role of DACH1 in regulating ERa occupancy in
the context of local chromatin, chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays were conducted using the pS2 gene promoter. PELP1 is
known to associate in the context of local chromatin at the pS2 gene
promoter. DACH1 occupied the ERE of the pS2 promoter in
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 6A). DACH1 is known to
recruit HDAC1 and NCoR corepressor complexes in the context of
local chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays at the pS2
promoter identified with DACH1 the presence of PELP1, ERa,
HDAC1, and histone H3. The presence of E2 increased ERa
abundance and reduced the relative binding of HDAC1 in chromatin
immunoprecipitation at the ERE (Fig. 6A). Quantitative analysis of
multiplicate experiments showed that treatment correlated with an
increased abundance of DACH1 at the ERE of the pS2 promoter by
f50% and reduced abundance of HDAC1 (f50%). To determine the
importance of PELP1 in HDAC recruitment to the ERE, MCF-7 cells
were transduced with PELP1 shRNA (Fig. 6B). HDAC1 chromatin

Discussion
A comprehensive body of evidence has shown the importance
of estrogen activity in the onset and progression of human breast
cancer (1). Tamoxifen treatment, which inhibits ERa function,
reduces the rate of onset of breast cancer in patients with BRCA2
mutations (38). Inhibition of ERa by aromatase treatment
improves prognosis in patients with ERa-positive breast cancer.
The constitutive endogenous inhibitors of ERa signaling, which
are lost in human breast cancer, represent an ideal new
therapeutic target. The ERa corepressor complex encodes a
NCoR/HDAC1/BRCA1 complex (39); however, there is no evidence
that the abundance of NCoR or HDAC is reduced during human
breast cancer progression. In the current studies, DACH1, the
expression of which is lost during breast cancer progression (19),
was identified as a repressor of endogenous ERa activity.
Using a proteomic approach, DACH1 was found to bind the
ERa coactivator PELP1. ERa is predominantly nuclear in the
absence of ligand (8, 40). PELP1 binds the ERa in a liganddependent manner. Herein DACH1 inhibited the PELP1/ERa
binding interaction and repressed PELP1-dependent activation of
ERa activity. PELP1 bound to the COOH terminus of DACH1.
DACH1 encodes a conserved Dac domain 1 (DS), which binds
HDAC1/HDAC3/c-Jun and is conserved from Drosophila to
humans (32, 41). The CREB binding protein coactivator also binds
DACH1 (19, 32, 42, 43). The internal deletion of the DACH DS
domain abrogated repression of ligand-dependent ERa activity.
Thus, the recruitment of corepressor complexes by DACH1 is
required for inhibition of ERa activity.
Immunohistochemical staining of normal mammary epithelial
cells showed that DACH1 localizes to the nucleus, primarily within
the nucleolus. In breast cancer cell lines, DACH1 distribution is
primarily nuclear, and DACH1 and PELP1 colocalize in f80% of cells
(Fig. 4D). These studies suggest that the relative balance of DACH1
and PELP1 in breast cancer cells modulates ERa signaling. PELP1
expression is increased in human breast cancer compared with
normal human breast epithelium (16) and a substantial number of
breast tumors coexpress PELP1 and ERa (44). In support of this
model, estrogen-induced DNA synthesis and basal DNA synthesis
were inhibited by DACH1 expression. DACH1 inhibition of estrogendependent DNA synthesis may involve the cyclin D1 gene because

DACH1 Represses ERa Signaling in ERa-Positive Breast Cancer

cyclin D1 is induced by E2 and the relative abundance of cyclin D1
governs basal and E2-induced MCF-7 cell DNA synthesis (45).
DACH1 is known to inhibit fibroblast DNA synthesis induced by
serum addition (19). Furthermore, genetic deletion of the cyclin D1
gene and cyclin D1 siRNA studies showed a key role for cyclin D1 in
DACH1-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis in fibroblasts (19).
PELP1 plays a role in cell cycle progression through regulation of
cyclin D1. PELP1 alters local chromatin structure required for
optimal transcriptional responses to ligand-bound nuclear receptors
(46) and is recruited to the promoter of ERa target genes including
pS2, IGF, and cyclin D1 (27).
The ERa binding coactivator protein PELP1 functions as a
molecular scaffold to recruit a variety of coactivators and histone
modifying proteins, and interacts with ERa through the LXXLL motif
1 to 5 (16). In addition to the ERa, PELP1 interacts with the androgen

receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor in a
ligand-dependent manner and with retinoid X receptor a (16, 47).
ERa complexes, which include PELP1, participate in membranemediated signaling by stimulating Src kinase, cytokines, mitogenactivated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (48). Estrogen promotes
the interaction between the AF-2 domain of ERa and PELP1. Recent
studies have suggested that PELP1 plays a role in promoting cellular
proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis via the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/AKT pathway (49). Conversely, PELP1 functions as a
corepressor of several transcription factors, including the DNA
binding transcription factors, serum response factor, nuclear factornB, and activator protein-1 proteins (50). The finding that DACH1
binds to PELP1 implicates DACH1 in a broad variety of signal
transduction pathways, which remain to be explored.
