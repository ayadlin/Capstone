Abstract
BALB/c mice bearing syngeneic BCL1 leukemia, a mouse
model of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia, were treated
with polymer-bound doxorubicin conjugate targeted with
BCL1-specific monoclonal antibody. Such treatment can cure
up to 100% of mice and the cured mice show long-lasting
resistance to BCL1 leukemia. We show that both CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells are required for establishment of the resistance,
but only CD8+ T cells are necessary for its maintenance. BCL1
cells express MHC class I and II and also costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, which can aid eliciting of antitumor
response. On the other hand, BCL1 cells also use several
immunoescape mechanisms, such as expression of PD-L1,
PD-L2, and interleukin-10. BCL1 cells thus can be recognized
by BCL1-specific T cells, but instead of effective priming,
such T cells are anergized or deleted by apoptosis. Moreover,
BCL1 leukemia progression is accompanied by robust expansion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. Although it
has been shown that depletion of Treg cells in tumor-bearing
mice can retard tumor growth, direct evidence that expansion
of Treg cells can promote tumor growth was lacking. In this
study, we provide first direct evidence that expanded Treg cells
can indeed promote tumor progression by using mice with
selectively expanded Treg cells before inoculation of BCL1 leukemia. Finally, we have also shown that elimination of some
immunoescape mechanism (e.g., deletion of Treg) can significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of chemotherapy.

Introduction
In this study, we used a conjugate of a synthetic, water-soluble,
and biocompatible copolymer based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) with doxorubicin bound via a Gly-Phe(D,L)Leu-Gly spacer (1, 2) and containing either human polyclonal
(i.e., nonspecific) antibody or B1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). B1
mAb specifically binds with high affinity to an idiotype of surface
IgM on BCL1 leukemia (3). Thus, we used a conjugate containing

potent cytostatic drug specifically targeted to BCL1 cells (2), which
enabled us to effectively treat mice bearing the leukemia while
causing only minimal damage to the immune system (1, 4).
Because genetic instability is a hallmark of all malignant cells (5),
tumors accumulate enormous number of mutations, and although
that only small proportion of these occur in open reading frames
of genes expressed by tumor cells, it is inevitable that any given
cancer cell will express at least few new antigenic determinants
that could be recognized by the immune system (6). Numerous
innate and adaptive immune effector cells participate in the
recognition and destruction of cancer cells, a process that is
known as cancer immunosurveillance (5–7). Cancer cells can
escape innate and adaptive immune either by immunosubversion or by immunoselection (8–12). Immunosubversion is a process of active suppression of the immune response by tumor cells.
Tumors use numerous different mechanisms ( further referenced
as immunoescape mechanisms) of immunosubversion (8, 13–16),
including down-regulation of MHC class I expression (9, 10) and
up-regulation of expression of CD95L (16), indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (14, 15), and arginase-1 or transforming growth factor-h
and interleukin (IL)-10 (17). Moreover, a significant expansion of
regulatory T (Treg) cells, which are capable of inhibiting both CD4+
and CD8+ T-cell responses, was observed during progression of
many types of tumors both in mice and humans (18).
It was reported previously that conjugates based on poly(HPMA)
containing doxorubicin are capable to completely cure tumorbearing mice and that some of these mice show tumor-specific
resistance (1, 4). The goal of our study was to investigate this
resistance; specifically, we aimed to determine which subset of
immunocompetent cells is necessary for the establishment and
which for the maintenance of the resistance. Another aim was to
determine which immunoescape mechanisms can be used by BCL1
cells to avoid rejection by immune system. We identified several
mechanisms used by BCL1 leukemia and we also showed that their
abrogation can significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of
chemotherapy. Moreover, we provided the first direct evidence that
mice with expanded Treg cells show faster tumor progression than
mice with normal counts of Treg cells.

Collection. DC2.4 dendritic cell line and J774A.1 were kindly provided by
Professor Jonathan Sprent (Garvan Institute, Sydney, Australia).
Monoclonal antibodies. The following anti-mouse mAbs have been
used for cell surface staining: CD80-APC (eBioscience), CD86-APC (CaltagInvitrogen), CD4-PE, CD4-PerCP, H2Kd-PE, I-A/E-PE (BD Pharmingen),
CD8-PB (Serotec), CD80-biotin, CD86-biotin (Southern Biotechnology
Associates), and CD25-APC. Unconjugated anti-mIL-2 mAb JES6-1A12,
anti-mouse Foxp3-PE, and IFN-g-PE mAb were purchased from eBioscience.
B1 mAb was prepared in our laboratory as described earlier (2).
Staining for surface antigens. Single-cell suspension was prepared
from spleens. After RBC lysis, cells were resuspended in flow cytometry
buffer (PBS/2% FCS/2 mmol EDTA/0.05% azide), blocked by 10% mouse
serum for 30 min on ice, and stained with mAbs for 30 min on ice in the
dark. When biotinylated mAbs were used, cells were additionally incubated
for 10 min on ice with fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin. Cells were
washed twice after each step in flow cytometry buffer and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde before analysis.
Intracellular staining. Foxp3 staining buffer set (eBioscience) was used
for Foxp3 staining and IC Fixation buffer and Permeabilization buffer
(eBioscience) were used for IFN-g staining. Surface antigens were stained as
described above. Cells were than resuspended in 100 AL of Fixation/
Permeabilization working solution and incubated for 30 to 60 min on ice
followed by washing twice with Permeabilization solution. Afterwards, cells
were blocked by 2% mouse serum for 10 min on ice. Next, mAb-PE
conjugate was added and cells were incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark.
Finally, cells were washed twice in Permeabilization buffer and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde.
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on LSRII (BD
Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Depletion of CD4+, CD8+, and CD25+ populations. CD4+, CD8+, and
CD25+ subpopulations were depleted by i.p. injection of the following
mAbs: aCD4 mAb (clone GK 1.5), aCD8 mAb (clone 53-6.72), and aCD25
mAb (clone PC 61.5). Two hundred fifty micrograms per mice of all mAbs
were injected.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from 5  106 cells
by using 1 mL of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies-Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA (1 Ag) was reverse transcribed using
oligo(dT)12-18 primer and SuperScript II RNase H Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen). Resulting cDNAs were used for PCR with specific primers for
mIL-10 (Genbank accession no. NM_010548), PD-L1 (Genbank accession no.
NM_021893), and PD-L2 (Genbank accession no. NM_021396).
Cytokine detection. IL-2, IL-10, IL-12, its subunits, and sTNFRI in
supernatants were detected by RayBio Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array I
(RayBiotech).
ELISA. Concentrations of IL-10, TNF-a, and IFN-g in supernatants were
determined by Mouse IL-10, TNF-a, and IFN-g CytoSets (BiosourceInvitrogen).
Polymer-bound doxorubicin conjugates. All polymer conjugates were
synthesized as described previously (19, 20).
Treg cell expansion. To expand Treg cells in vivo, BALB/c mice were
treated for 7 consecutive days before BCL1 cell inoculation with IL-2/JES61A12 mAb immunocomplexes. These immunocomplexes (21) were prepared
by adding rmIL-2 into solution of anti-IL-2 mAb JES6-1A12 (both reagents
were in PBS) at a molar ratio of 2:1. After 15-min incubation at room
temperature, the immunocomplexes were diluted with PBS into desired
concentration and i.p. injected in 250 AL into BALB/c mice. Small sample
(50–100 AL) of peripheral blood was taken from tail vein 24 h after last
injection, and expansion of Treg cells (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) was checked by
flow cytometry.
Western blotting. Cells (1–5  107) were washed twice with an ice-cold
TBS with 1 Amol/L Na3VO4 and centrifuged (4,000  g, 4jC). Then, cells
were resuspended in Extract buffer composed of 1% NP40 (Pierce), 1 mmol/
L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
DTT, 5% protease mix (Sigma), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
and TBS (pH 7.4) and passed 10 times through a needle (25–30 gauge).
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 4,000  g (4jC) and protein concentration in aspirated supernatants was determined. Protein (20 Ag) was loaded

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

per lane and run on standard SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gel.
Semidry blotting procedure with nitrocellulose membrane was performed
and CD86 was detected with goat anti-mouse CD86 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and anti-goat horseradish peroxidase–linked IgG (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology).
Proliferation assay in vitro. BCL1 cells were collected from an
exponential growth phase culture. They were centrifuged for 5 min at
300  g, washed, resuspended in fresh culture medium, and seeded into
Nunc 96-well flat-bottom plates in 0.2 mL volume and 5  104 cells/mL
density. Polymeric conjugates rmIFN-g and rmTNF-a (R&D Systems) were
then added to the wells to achieve desired concentrations. Five wells for
each test condition were used. The plates were then cultured in 5% CO2
for 72 h at 37jC. [3H]thymidine (18.5 kBq) was added for final 16 h of
cultivation before harvesting.
Treatment of established BCL1 leukemia in vivo. BCL1 cells were
prepared as described for in vitro studies. BCL1 cells (5  105) in 0.5 mL of
culture medium without serum were i.p. inoculated on day 0 into BALB/c
mice. HPMA copolymer-bound doxorubicin conjugates were injected i.v.
on day 11 if not stated otherwise. Mice surviving day 90 without any signs
of BCL1 leukemia were considered as long-term survivors (LTS). These mice
were rechallenged with 104 BCL1 and left without any additional treatment
to determine the resistance of LTS to BCL1 leukemia.
Statistical analysis. The significance of any differences obtained among
experimental groups was evaluated by the Student’s t test and significant
difference was considered when P < 0.05.

Results
B1 mAb-targeted conjugates are able to cure BALB/c mice
bearing BCL1 leukemia and induce BCL1-specific resistance.
B1 mAb recognizes idiotype of surface IgM on BCL1 cells and thus
B1 mAb-targeted conjugates specifically kill BCL1 cells. Two structures of antibody-containing conjugates, called classic and star
structure (20), were used (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cytostatic
activity of B1 mAb-targeted conjugates against BCL1 cells in vitro
was determined (Supplementary Table S1). To examine therapeutic
efficacy of B1 mAb-targeted conjugates in vivo, BALB/c mice
were i.p. inoculated with BCL1 cells and treated by i.v. injected
conjugates. Two doses of star structure conjugate cured all experimental mice, whereas conjugate of classic structure cured 75%
of BCL1 leukemia-bearing mice (Fig. 1A, left). Conjugates containing human polyclonal IgG instead of B1 mAb were not able to cure
any mice, despite the fact that the treatment significantly
prolonged survival (Fig. 1A, right). Neither free doxorubicin nor
free B1 mAb was able to cure any BCL1 bearing mice even when
doxorubicin was given at maximal tolerated dose (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Interestingly, when the cured mice were rechallenged with
a lethal dose of BCL1 cells, the mice were resistant to BCL1
leukemia (Fig. 1B). This resistance was observed even if the mice
were reinoculated very long time after the treatment (4 months);
thus, the phenomenon can be characterized as a long-lasting
immune memory. The resistance is BCL1 leukemia specific because
mice are not resistant to other BALB/c-derived tumors (RAW264.7
and J774A.1; data not shown). In the next step, we investigated
whether the time when treatment is administered affects the
strength of the induced resistance. Indeed, when the treatment is
provided very early after BCL1 cell inoculation, the cured mice are
not resistant to BCL1 leukemia at all (Fig. 1C). Similarly, treatment
provided relatively late during the progression of BCL1 leukemia
did not leave any mice able to survive rechallenge with BCL1 cells.
The optimal time frame of treatment to establish effective
resistance against BCL1 leukemia was between day 7 and 11 after
BCL1 cell inoculation.

CD8+ T-Cell–Mediated Resistance to BCL1 Leukemia

Figure 1. B1 mAb-targeted conjugates are able
to cure BALB/c mice bearing BCL1 leukemia
and establish BCL1 resistance. A, BALB/c mice
bearing BCL1 leukemia were treated either with
B1 mAb-targeted conjugates (left) or conjugates
containing irrelevant human polyclonal IgG
(right ) of either star or classic structure.
Treatment was provided i.v. on days 11 and
14 after tumor cell inoculation (5  105 i.p.) and
one dose contained 5 mg/kg doxorubicin.
Control mice were injected with the same
volume of saline (300 AL). B, completely cured
mice from A were reinoculated i.p. with lethal
dose of BCL1 cells (5  104) on day 110 and left
without any treatment. C, BALB/c mice bearing
BCL1 leukemia were treated with single dose
of star structure of HPMA copolymer-bound
doxorubicin conjugate targeted with B1 mAb.
One dose containing 5 mg/kg doxorubicin was
injected i.v. at selected intervals after i.p.
inoculation of 5  105 BCL1 cells (day 3, 7,
11, or 15). The table on the right shows portion
(%) of LTS (>90 d) after treatment as well as
portion (%) of LTS after i.p. reinoculation of
cured mice with 5  104 BCL1 cells (the
numbers in brackets show mean survival time).
All experiments were done at least twice with
similar results.

Role of different subsets of immune cells in conferring
resistance to BCL1 leukemia following treatment with targeted
polymeric drugs. We hypothesized that immune system may
contribute to efficient treatment of BCL1 leukemia by B1 mAbtargeted conjugates. Therefore, we compared the efficacy of the
treatment in immunocompetent BALB/c mice versus immunocompromised nu/nu mice. nu/nu mice do not have thymus and
thus they lack T cells, but they have B cells as well as natural killer
cells. Treatment with B1 mAb-targeted conjugate at a dose that
cured 50% of BALB/c mice did not cure any nu/nu mice (Fig. 2A),
which implies that T cells augment the therapeutic effect. To
elucidate which subset of T cells plays a key role in the resistance
to BCL1 leukemia, we performed experiments on BALB/c mice
with depleted CD4+, CD8+, or both subsets of T cells. Surprisingly,
treatment with B1 mAb-targeted conjugate was more effective in
CD4+-depleted mice than in normal BALB/c mice (Fig. 2B, left).
However, all mice that were CD4+ depleted during treatment died
on rechallenge with BCL1 cells, although significantly later than
control mice (Fig. 2B, right). When CD8+ or both CD4+ and CD8+
cells were depleted, establishment of BCL1-specific resistance
was completely abrogated (Fig. 2C). To confirm that CD8+ cells are
essential for the resistance to BCL1 leukemia, we depleted CD8+
or CD4+ cells in mice that survived treatment of BCL1 leukemia
with B1-targeted conjugate as well as subsequent rechallenge with

www.aacrjournals.org

BCL1 cells. Depletion of CD8+ cells but not CD4+ cells before
second rechallenge with BCL1 cells caused abrogation of the
resistance (Fig. 3A). CD4+ cells are thus required for establishment
of the resistance but CD8+ cells are responsible for maintaining
long-lasting BCL1-specific resistance. Next, we tried to elucidate
whether BCL1-specific memory T cells can be found only in CD8+
compartment or also in CD4+ T-cell subset. As shown in Fig. 3B,
both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell subsets in spleen of BCL1-resistant
mice contain f1% of cells, which express IFN-g on coculture with
BCL1 cells. Almost all of these BCL1-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells
are CD44high, showing that they have phenotype of memory T cells.
When splenocytes from BCL1-resistant but not from naive BALB/c
mice were cocultured with BCL1 cells, very high concentrations of
IFN-g and also TNF-a were found in the supernatants (Fig. 3C).
IFN-g and TNF-a production was BCL1 specific, as these cytokines
were not detected after coculture of splenocytes from BCL1resistant mice with other BALB/c-derived tumor cells (J774A.1;
data not shown). Once we realized that BCL1-specific T cells
produce IFN-g and TNF-a on contact with BCL1 cells, we decided
to test the effect of these cytokines on proliferation of BCL1 cells.
Figure 3D shows that proliferation of BCL1 cells is quite sensitive
to IFN-g (50% inhibition of BCL1 cell proliferation at f1 ng/mL),
whereas TNF-a has no effect on proliferation of BCL1 cells within
the tested concentration range (10 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL).

Figure 2. Involvement of immune system in
complete eradication of BCL1 cells during
treatment with B1 mAb-targeted conjugates; both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required for initiation
of effective BCL1 resistance. A, nu/nu and
BALB/c mice were i.p. inoculated with 5  105
BCL1 cells. Mice were i.v. injected at days 11 and
14 with classic structure of B1 mAb-targeted
HPMA copolymer-bound doxorubicin conjugate
(5 mg/kg doxorubicin per dose). BALB/c mice
depleted of either CD4+ cells (B), CD8+ cells,
or both (C) were inoculated as in A. B and C,
left, treatment was given i.v. at day 11 (5 mg/kg
doxorubicin) and day 14 (2.5 mg/kg doxorubicin).
Right, cured mice were i.p. reinoculated with
lethal dose of BCL1 cells (5  104) and left
without any treatment. The same symbol
(square, triangle , and circle ) is used for given
experimental group in both right and left
panels. Experiments were done twice with
similar results.

BCL1 cells use several immunoescape mechanisms to
abrogate immune response. Because many types of cancer evade
immune response by down-regulation of MHC I expression, we
looked on the expression of this key molecule on BCL1 cells.
Surprisingly, we found that BCL1 cells express MHC I at level
comparable with normal B cells (data not shown). This applies
also for MHC II and two costimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86
(Fig. 4). CD80 expression was relatively high, whereas the expression of CD86 was intermediate. Strikingly, these data imply that
BCL1 cells could work as antigen-presenting cells (APC) and thus
could prime BCL1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. On the contrary,
BCL1 cells also express PD-L1, PD-L2, and IL-10 (Fig. 4B). IL-10 was
also detected in supernatant of ex vivo–cultured BCL1 cells but not
in supernatant of ex vivo–cultured splenocytes from normal BALB/
c mice (Fig. 4B, right). Furthermore, we found that level of IL-2 was
significantly decreased in serum of mice bearing BCL1 leukemia
(Fig. 4C). Serum of BCL1 leukemia-bearing mice contained the
same level of IL-12 (detected as p70) as serum of healthy mice.
Significant increase in serum level of IL-12 was observed when this
cytokine was detected as p40/p70, but only in serum from mice

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

bearing BCL1 leukemia. This implies that the serum contained p40
dimers, which are potent IL-12 antagonists. Next, we decided to
examine whether BCL1 leukemia has any effect on population of
Treg cells, which are known to hamper antitumor immunity by
suppressing both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. As shown in
Fig. 5A, relative number of Treg cells sharply increased during
progression of BCL1 leukemia. Determination of Treg cells was
based on CD25+Foxp3+ double positivity in CD4+-gated cells. We
showed that the increase of Treg cells is not only relative (Fig. 5B, left
and middle) and that also absolute number of Treg cells increased
(Fig. 5B, right). No significant increase of CD4+CD25+Foxp3
(i.e., activation of naive CD4+CD25 cells) was observed. Then,
we performed experiment when we either deliberately expanded
or depleted population of Treg cells in BALB/c mice before
inoculation of BCL1 cells. Mice with expanded Treg cell population
(f40% of CD4+ cells) died significantly earlier than control mice,
whereas mice depleted from Treg cells died significantly later
(Fig. 5C and D). This finding strongly suggests that BCL1 leukemia
uses expansion of Treg cell population to protect itself from immune response.

CD8+ T-Cell–Mediated Resistance to BCL1 Leukemia

Elimination of Treg cells improves treatment with suboptimal dose of B1 mAb-targeted conjugate. We examined whether
abrogation of some immunoescape mechanisms of BCL1 leukemia
(i.e., depletion of Treg cells) could increase therapeutic activity of
B1 mAb-targeted conjugate. BCL1-bearing mice depleted from Treg
cells were treated with suboptimal dose of B1 mAb-targeted
conjugate. Indeed, treatment was more effective in Treg cell–
depleted mice than in control mice containing normal numbers
of Treg cells (Fig. 6A). This effect is rather modest than strong
(three versus one cured mouse), but on the other hand, the
experiment was done twice using relatively large experimental
groups (eight mice), and thus we believe that elimination of
Treg cells indeed improves treatment with suboptimal dose of B1
mAb-targeted conjugate. All mice cured in these two experiments were resistant to BCL1 leukemia, which was proved by
rechallenge of these mice with lethal dose of BCL1 cells (data
not shown).

Discussion
The conjugates based on poly(HPMA) containing doxorubicin as
cancerostatic drug and their antitumor activity were previously

described in several different tumor models (1, 2, 4). We and others
have previously highlighted the advantage of use of such conjugates in comparison with free drug, and now we show some
interesting features and important immunologic mechanisms
induced by the treatment with this novel class of anticancer drugs.
Single-dose treatment of BALB/c mice at various time points
after BCL1 cell inoculation showed that the treatment must be
given in optimal time frame (day 7–11) to establish BCL1-specific
protective immunity in cured mice. As we show in Supplementary
Table S2, a small mass of death tumor cells could be a reason
explaining ineffective establishment of protective antitumor
immunity in mice cured too early after tumor cell inoculation.
Although this study was done with EL4 T-cell lymphoma, we
believe that the results are also applicable to BCL1 leukemia as we
have strong experience with both these cell lines and we know that
the pattern of anti-EL4–specific and anti-BCL1–specific protective
immunity is very identical. We also checked whether the failure to
establish effective anti-BCL1 leukemia when the treatment is given
too late could be caused by increased numbers of Treg cells.
However, this explanation is not the right one, as Treg cell numbers
remain constant at least until day 15 after i.p. inoculation of
5  105 BCL1 cells at day 0 (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Figure 3. CD8+ T cells are essential for
long-lasting resistance to BCL1 leukemia.
A, BALB/c mice completely cured from
BCL1 leukemia with B1 mAb-targeted
conjugate were i.p. reinoculated with 5 
104 BCL1 cells. Left, LTS (>90 d) were
either depleted from CD8+ cells or not
and again i.p. reinoculated with 5  104
BCL1 cells; right, LTS that were depleted
either from CD4+ cells or from both CD8+
and CD4+ cells. B, spleen cells from
LTS were cocultivated under standard
conditions (37jC, 5% CO2, humidified
atmosphere) for 7 h with BCL1 cells.
Brefeldin A was added for the last
5 h of incubation (1 Amol/L). Cells were
then stained for extracellular markers,
washed, and fixed. Next, cells were
permeabilized and stained for mouse
IFN-g. C, splenocytes isolated from LTS
or naive BALB/c mice were cultured
either alone or with BCL1 cells. After 24 h,
supernatants were collected and
concentration of selected cytokines was
measured by ELISA. D, BCL1 cells were
isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice
bearing BCL1 leukemia (>94% purity).
rmTNF-a and rmIFN-g were added at
desired concentrations and cells were
incubated under standard condition for
72 h. [3H]thymidine (18.5 kBq) was
added for the last 16 h. Cell proliferation for
each experimental condition is expressed
as % of [3H]thymidine incorporation into
control cells (higher than 20,000 cpm/well
in all experiments). Each experiment
was done twice with similar results.

The role of CD8+ cells in effective antitumor response is well
established, and particularly in BCL1 model, CD8+ cells were shown
to be vital for the allogeneic elimination of clonogenic leukemia
cells (22). Once we confirmed that CD8+ T cells are indeed the
essential subset responsible for long-lasting BCL1-specific immune
memory, we focused our interest on possible interactions of BCL1
cells with immune system and immunoescape mechanisms of this
tumor. First, we found that BCL1 cells do not mask against
immune system by down-regulation of MHC class I expression,
which is a common mechanism of many tumors to evade immune
system (9, 10). Moreover, BCL1 cells express not only MHC class I
but also MHC class II and two main costimulatory molecules CD80
and CD86. Because coexpression of these molecules on tumor
cells is rather striking, we confirmed this finding by three different
methods [i.e., by flow cytometry, reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR), and Western blotting; Fig. 4A]. The BCL1 cells could therefore work as APCs and thus should be capable of priming BCL1-

specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. To figure out how can BCL1 cells
escape self-rejection while expressing molecules involved in T-cell
priming, we intensively searched for molecules that are known to
impair T-cell activation. We found that BCL1 cells express PD-L1,
PD-L2, and also IL-10. It is well established that PD-L1 and/or PDL2 expression on APCs renders those APCs strongly tolerogenic
because engagement of PD-L1 or PD-L2 with their receptor PD on
T cells causes either anergy or apoptosis of these T cells (23, 24).
IL-10 has immunosuppressive activity on T cells, both indirectly via
modulation of dendritic cell (25) and also in direct fashion (26, 27),
particularly by inhibiting proliferation as well as cytokine synthesis
by CD4+ cells. In addition, IL-10 inhibits the monocytic production
of IL-12, an essential mediator for the development of effector
functions of CD8+ T cells (28–31). Furthermore, the presence of
IL-10 during the activation of CD4+ cells results in the development
of regulatory phenotype of these cells (32). Increased levels of
IL-10 were not found in the serum of BALB/c mice bearing BCL1

leukemia, showing that IL-10 produced by BCL1 cells works only in
paracrine fashion. However, we found that serum of BALB/c mice
bearing BCL1 leukemia had significantly decreased IL-2 level,
which is also an unfavorable condition for T-cell priming. More
importantly, serum of BALB/c mice bearing BCL1 leukemia contained p40 dimers, strong IL-12 antagonists (33, 34), which can
severely impair the effector functions of CD8+ T cells (30). In
conclusion, BCL1 cells show a phenotype of tolerogenic APCs
(i.e., use rather unique immunoescape strategy while taking advantage of their ability to make cell-cell contact with T cells and
anergize or delete those that are BCL1 specific).
Naturally arising CD25+ CD4+ Treg cells, which constitute 5%
to 10% of peripheral CD4+ T cells in normal rodents and humans,

are produced in the thymus as a functionally mature and distinct
subpopulation of T cells (18, 35). Constitutive high expression of
CD25 plus forkhead winged-helix (Foxp3) transcription factor (36)
is a typical feature of Treg cells distinguishing them from recently
activated T cells, which also express CD25. They play key roles
not only in the maintenance of immunologic self-tolerance (i.e.,
prevention of autoimmunity; refs. 37–39) but also in the control
of aberrant or excessive immune responses to various invading
infections (40, 41). A significant role for Treg cells has also been
implicated in abrogating effective antitumor immunity (42). In this
study, we showed that progression of BCL1 leukemia is accompanied by gradual increase of Treg cells (Fig. 5A and B). The increase
in Treg cell numbers is relatively common for many other types of

Figure 6. Poor therapeutic effect of suboptimal dose of B1 mAb-targeted
conjugate can be increased by depletion of Treg cells. A, BALB/c mice were i.p.
inoculated with 5  105 BCL1 cells at day 0 and distributed into four groups, each
containing eight mice. Control group was left untreated, whereas mice in two
other groups were i.p injected with anti-CD25 mAb (150 Ag/mice) on day 8. B,
efficiency of Treg cell depletion was checked by flow cytometry from small
samples of peripheral blood taken at day 11. On the same day, one group with
depleted Treg cells and one group with normal Treg cell population were i.v.
treated with single suboptimal dose (3 mg/kg doxorubicin) of B1 mAb-targeted
conjugate (star structure). Survival of mice in each experimental group was
carefully recorded. Experiments were done twice with similar results.

tumors and can be seen both in humans and rodents (43, 44).
Depletion of Treg cells by anti-CD25 mAb was shown to augment
antitumor immunity in several models (44–47). Such depletion
experiments were thus far the only evidence that expanded
population of Treg cells impedes antitumor immunity and thus
promotes tumor progression. Here, we report first direct evidence
that an increase of Treg cells accelerates tumor progression (Fig. 5C
and D). We could provide such evidence because we were able
to deliberately expand Treg cell population in vivo by use of
immunocomplexes of rmIL-2 and anti-mouse IL-2 mAb JES61A12, which were previously shown to stimulate the expansion of

Treg cells (21, 48), before inoculation of BCL1 cells, which indeed
exacerbated the disease. In addition, we also used mice depleted
from Treg cells, which showed slower progression of BCL1 leukemia
than control untreated mice as expected. Finally, we showed that
the depletion of Treg cells significantly enhances the antitumor
activity of our targeted conjugate (Fig. 6A). In sum, we showed that
the increase of Treg cells accelerated the progression of BCL1
leukemia and thus could be considered as another immunoescape
mechanism used by BCL1 leukemia. It is of note that the increased
population of Treg cells may explain the significantly lower serum
concentration of IL-2 in BCL1 leukemia-bearing mice compared
with healthy mice (Fig. 4C). Treg cells are IL-2 dependent (49) and
can use even very low concentration of IL-2. Higher number of
Treg cells using IL-2 thus can cause a substantial decrease of IL-2 in
the serum.
About the establishment of BCL1 resistance triggered by the
therapy with targeted conjugates, we hypothesize that the
treatment causes a massive death of BCL1 cells, whereas a considerable amount of cell fragments and other material is released
and available for cross-presentation on dendritic cells. It is of
special note that our targeted conjugate has negligible immunosuppressive activity (1, 4), and thus, nonimpaired immune system
is ready to elicit BCL1-specific response. As we showed in this
study, BCL1 cells are theoretically capable of antigen presentation
to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but in tolerogenic/proapoptotic
fashion. Thus, the cross-presentation of BCL1-specific antigens
on host dendritic cells is particularly important to establish BCL1specific resistance.
In conclusion, our results show that identifying the immunoescape mechanisms used by the particular tumor to evade immune
response could be very important for the therapy. Elimination of
these mechanisms most likely augments standard treatment
procedure and can lead to complete remission with an establishment of long-lasting resistance to the tumor. Here, we showed that
it could be possible to turn a tumor into its own cellular vaccine by
combination of chemotherapy and immunomodulation.
