presented a significant obstacle for general use of these agents for
cancer prevention (4).
Among many described activities of NSAIDs, induction of
apoptosis secondary to inhibition of COX enzymes seems to play a
critical role in NSAID-mediated chemoprevention (2, 3, 5). Apoptosis
is a major mechanism regulating turnover of intestinal epithelial
cells from which colon tumors are derived (6). During the formation
of a colon tumor, apoptosis is progressively inhibited due to
oncogenic mutations (7). Deregulation of apoptosis is necessary
for oncogenic transformation and drives neoplastic cells to gain
additional tumorigenic features (8). NSAIDs have been found to
induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (2, 3). The
apoptotic level can be used as a biomarker for NSAID-mediated
chemoprevention (9, 10). Furthermore, it has been shown that
NSAID treatment can reverse the antiapoptotic effects of COX 2 (11).
In mammalian cells, apoptotic cell death is executed through a
cascade of events, among which a key event is the translocation of
apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondria into the cytosol to
trigger caspase activation. Cytochrome c is released from the
mitochondria into the cytosol, where it binds to other proteins to
form an ‘‘apoptosome’’ (12). Second mitochondria-derived activator
of caspase (SMAC thereafter), also called direct inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (IAP)–binding protein with low isoelectric point
(Diablo), is the second mitochondrial protein found to be released
into the cytosol during apoptosis (13, 14). After its release, SMAC
binds to IAPs through its N-terminal AVPI domain and relieves
their inhibition of caspases (15).
The unfolding of the complex pathways involved in apoptosis
signaling has stimulated intensive efforts to restore apoptosis in
cancer cells for therapeutic purposes (16). It has been shown that
SMAC overexpression and SMAC mimetic peptides enhance the
proapoptotic effects of several anticancer agents, such as tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL;
refs. 13, 17–20). Several small molecules mimicking the AVPI
domain of SMAC have also been developed (21–23). For example,
a compound called C3 was synthesized based on the structure of
SMAC (21). C3 is a symmetric dimer of an oxazoline-derived
compound. It can penetrate cell membranes and bind to the IAPs
with high affinity. Nanomolar concentrations of C3 promote both
TRAIL-induced and TNF-a–induced apoptosis in human cancer
cells (21). However, it remains unclear how SMAC and SMAC
mimetics potentiate apoptosis induced by anticancer agents.
SMAC release occurs after mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization, a process thought to happen after commitment
to cell death (24).
Although numerous efforts have been made toward developing therapeutic agents, manipulation of apoptotic pathways
for chemoprevention has not been extensively explored. Our
previous studies showed that SMAC plays an essential role in
NSAID-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells (25). SMAC is

Abstract
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are effective
in suppressing the formation of colorectal tumors. However,
the mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic effects of
NSAIDs remain unclear. The effects of NSAIDs are incomplete,
and resistance to NSAIDs is often developed. Growing evidence
has indicated that the chemopreventive activity of NSAIDs is
mediated by induction of apoptosis. Our previous studies
showed that second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase
(SMAC)/Diablo, a mitochondrial apoptogenic protein, plays an
essential role in NSAID-induced apoptosis in colon cancer
cells. In this study, we found that SMAC mediates NSAIDinduced apoptosis through a feedback amplification mechanism involving interactions with inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins, activation of caspase-3, and induction of cytosolic
release of cytochrome c. Small-molecule SMAC mimetics at
nanomolar concentrations significantly sensitize colon cancer
cells to NSAID-induced apoptosis by promoting caspase-3
activation and cytochrome c release. Furthermore, SMAC
mimetics overcome NSAID resistance in Bax-deficient or
SMAC-deficient colon cancer cells by restoring caspase-3
activation and cytochrome c release. Together, these results
suggest that SMAC is useful as a target for the development of
more effective chemopreventive strategies and agents. [Cancer

Introduction
Prevention of human cancers through the use of chemical agents
or dietary manipulation has emerged as a promising approach
to reduce morbidity and mortality of cancer (1). A number of
epidemiologic studies, clinical trials, and animal studies have shown
that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as
sulindac and aspirin, are effective against colorectal cancer, the
second leading cause of cancer-related death (2, 3). However, the
mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic effects of NSAIDs remain
unclear. The effects of NSAIDs are incomplete, and resistance to
NSAIDs is often developed (2, 3). Furthermore, the side effects
associated with high dose of NSAIDs, such as the cardiovascular
toxicity of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)–specific inhibitors, have

SMAC Mimetics Promote NSAID-Induced Cytochrome Release

Figure 1. SMAC and cytochrome c release during NSAID-induced apoptosis. A, time course of SMAC release. HCT116 cells were treated with 120 Amol/L sulindac.
Cytosolic fractions at the indicated time points were isolated, and the expression of SMAC was analyzed by Western blotting. B, after HCT116 cells were treated
with 120 Amol/L sulindac, the association between caspase-3 and cIAP-1 or cIAP-2 at indicated time points was analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP ) with cIAP-1 or
cIAP-2 antibodies, respectively. C, time course of caspase-3 activation. Caspase-3 activation was analyzed by Western blotting at the indicated time points after
sulindac treatment. D, cytochrome c release in HCT116 and SMAC -KO cells. Cytochrome c release in HCT116 and SMAC -KO cells treated with 120 Amol/L sulindac
was analyzed by Western blotting. Cox IV and a-tubulin, which are exclusively expressed in the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively, were used as controls for
loading and fractionation.

Pharmaceuticals. All compounds were prepared as 100 Amol/L stock
solutions in DMSO. In some cases, caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk
(20 Amol/L; R & D Systems) was used to treat cells in combination with
the agents described above.
Western blotting. The antibodies used for Western blotting included
those against caspase-9, Bid (Cell Signaling Technology), cytochrome c,
a-tubulin (BD Biosciences), caspase-3 (Stressgen Bioreagents), cytochrome
oxidase subunit IV (Cox IV; Invitrogen), Bim, and SMAC (EMD Biosciences).
Western blotting analysis was performed as previously described (28).
Apoptosis assays. After treatment, attached and floating cells were
harvested at various time points. The fractions of apoptotic cells were
evaluated by nuclear staining and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. For
nuclear staining, cells were fixed in a solution containing 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.5% Nonidet P40, and 10 Ag/mL 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole,
dihydrochloride in PBS and assessed for apoptosis through microscopic
visualization of condensed chromatin and micronucleation. For each
measurement, at least three independent experiments and a minimum of
300 cells were analyzed. For Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, cells
were stained by propidium iodide and then Annexin V-Alexa 594
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry
was used to quantitate Annexin V–positive and propidium iodide–positive
cells. Long-term cell survival was evaluated by colony formation assays. In
brief, harvested cells were plated in 12-well plates at appropriate dilutions.
Cells were allowed to grow for 10 to 14 days before staining with Crystal
Violet (Sigma).
Analysis of cytochrome c release. Mitochondrial and cytosolic
fractions were isolated from treated cells by differential centrifugation as
previously described (29). Concentrations of cytosolic fractions obtained
from different samples were normalized using protein assay dye reagent
from Bio-Rad. All fractions were mixed with equal volumes of 2 Laemmli
sample buffer for Western blotting analysis.
Caspase-3 RNA interference. Two caspase-3 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) duplexes (Cas-3 986, 5¶-UGA GGU AGC UUC AUA GUG Gtt-3¶; Cas-3
182, 5¶-TGA CAT CTC GGT CTG GTA Ctt-3¶) were purchased from
Dharmacon, Inc., as 20 Amol/L stock solutions. Cells were transfected with

consistently released from the mitochondria into the cytosol
during NSAID-induced apoptosis. Deletion of SMAC by homologous recombination or knockdown of SMAC by RNA interference abrogates NSAID-induced caspase activation and apoptosis
(25). Unexpectedly, NSAID-induced cytochrome c release was
also found to be compromised in the SMAC-deficient cells (25).
In this study, we further investigated how SMAC functions in
NSAID-induced apoptosis, as well as the effects of smallmolecule SMAC mimetics on NSAID-induced apoptosis and NSAID
resistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatment. The colorectal cancer cell lines used
in the study, including HCT116, HT29, and DLD1, were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection. SMAC-knockout (SMAC-KO) and BAXknockout (BAX-KO) HCT116 cell lines were previously described (25, 26). All
cell lines were cultured in McCoy’s 5A media (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% defined fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) and were maintained at 37jC in 5%
CO2. SMAC-reconstituted SMAC-KO cell lines were generated by transfecting SMAC-KO cells with wild-type (AVPI) or mutant SMAC (DA; ref. 27),
followed by selection in 0.4 mg/mL G-418 (Invitrogen). To induce apoptosis,
cells were plated at 20% to 30% density in 12-well plates and allowed
to attach overnight. DMSO stock solutions of sulindac sulfide (Merck) at
40 mmol/L and indomethacin (Sigma) at 100 mmol/L were freshly prepared
and diluted into appropriate concentrations by cell culture medium.
Different concentrations of sulindac and indomethacin were used for
apoptosis induction in different colon cancer cell lines and were determined
based on their dose responses, as previously described (25). The SMAC
mimetic and control compounds, C3 and C4, respectively (21), were
provided by Dr. Xiaodong Wang and Dr. Patrick G. Harran at University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center. An independent set of SMAC mimetic
testing (GT-T) and control (GT-C) compounds were supplied by TetraLogic

caspase-3 activation are early events in NSAID-induced apoptosis
and regulate later apoptotic events, such as cytochrome c release
and nuclear fragmentation.
IAP binding is required for SMAC-mediated caspase-3
activation and cytochrome c release. To further study how
SMAC mediates cytochrome c release, we tested whether the IAP
inhibition and/or caspase-3 activation functions of SMAC, which are
mediated by the N-terminal AVPI domain of cytosolic SMAC (30),
are necessary for NSAID-induced apoptosis and cytochrome c
release. Wild-type (AVPI) or mutant SMAC containing a deletion of
alanine in the AVPI domain (DA), which abolishes the interactions
between SMAC and IAPs (30), was transfected into the SMAC-KO
cells (Fig. 2A). Two independent stable cell lines expressing the wildtype or mutant SMAC were analyzed for their responses to
120 Amol/L sulindac. The deficiency in NSAID-induced apoptosis
in the SMAC-KO cells was completely rescued by the expression of
the wild-type, but not the mutant, SMAC (Fig. 2B). Expression of the
wild-type SMAC also rescued caspase-3 activation in the SMAC-KO
cells (Fig. 2C). Importantly, wild-type, but not the mutant, SMAC
restored sulindac-induced cytochrome c release to a level similar
to that in the parental HCT116 cells (Fig. 2D). These results suggest
that inhibition of IAPs by cytosolic SMAC through their direct
interactions promotes cytochrome c–independent caspase-3 activation at early stage and cytochrome c release at later stages in
NSAID-induced apoptosis.
Caspase-3 activation is necessary for SMAC-mediated
cytochrome c release. Next, we determined whether caspase-3
activation is critical for NSAID-induced and SMAC-mediated
apoptosis and cytochrome c release. Cells were transiently transfected with two caspase-3 siRNA (Cas-3 986 and Cas-3 182) before

Results
NSAID-induced cytochrome c release is delayed and
attenuated in SMAC-KO cells. Our previous study showed that
SMAC deficiency perturbed NSAID-induced release of cytochrome
c and apoptosis-inducing factor in HCT116 colon cancer cells (25).
To further characterize how SMAC mediates NSAID-induced
apoptosis, we analyzed the time courses of apoptotic events in
HCT116 cells treated with sulindac at 120 Amol/L, which is the
minimum concentration that is necessary to induce a high level
(>70%) of apoptosis in these cells (25). A burst of SMAC release was
detected as early as 8 h after the treatment (Fig. 1A), long before
cells started to show morphologic signs of apoptosis. Caspase-3
was dissociated from IAP family members cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, but
not XIAP, as early as 8 h after sulindac treatment (Fig. 1B and data
not shown). At 12 to 16 h, caspase-3 was found to be activated
(Fig. 1C), but a very low level (<5%) of nuclear fragmentation could
be detected (data not shown). In contrast, the majority of
cytochrome c release occurred at 24 and 32 h after the treatment
(Fig. 1D) when high levels (>50%) of nuclear fragmentation could
be detected (25, 26). However, sulindac-induced cytochrome c
release and nuclear fragmentation were significantly delayed and
attenuated in the SMAC-KO cells compared with the parental
HCT116 cells (Fig. 1D and data not shown; ref. 25). These results
showed that SMAC release and cytochrome c–independent

or mutant SMAC containing a deletion of alanine in the AVPI domain (DA). Two pairs of clones with stable expression of each SMAC construct were isolated,
and SMAC expression was verified by Western blotting. B, the indicated cell lines were treated with 120 Amol/L sulindac for 48 h. Apoptosis was analyzed by nuclear
staining. C, effects of wild-type and mutant SMAC on NSAID-induced caspase activation were analyzed by Western blotting. D, effects of wild-type and mutant
SMAC on NSAID-induced cytochrome c release were analyzed by Western blotting.

and another colon cancer cell line HT29 using the caspase-3
inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk (Fig. 3C).
The dependence of mitochondrial cytochrome c release on the
cytosolic actions of SMAC and caspase-3 suggested a protein,
presumably a caspase or a caspase substrate, could translocate
from the cytosol to the mitochondria to induce cytochrome c
release. We first considered caspase-3 itself, but did not detect any
mitochondrial accumulation of caspase-3 after sulindac treatment
(data not shown). Another candidate is the BH3-only Bcl-2 family

sulindac treatment. Knockdown of caspase-3 expression resulted in
a significant reduction of sulindac-induced apoptosis in HCT116
cells (Fig. 3A and B). However, no further decrease in apoptosis was
observed after knockdown of caspase-3 in the SMAC-KO cells
(Fig. 3B), suggesting that SMAC and caspase-3 function in a linear
pathway to promote NSAID-induced apoptosis. Caspase-3 knockdown also led to significant inhibition of cytochrome c release
(Fig. 3C). The critical role of caspase-3 in promoting sulindacinduced cytochrome c release was confirmed by treating HCT116

domain for the SMAC function prompted us to test whether
pharmacologic agents that mimic this domain can enhance NSAIDinduced apoptosis. We tested C3, a small-molecule mimic of the
AVPI residues of SMAC, and its control compound C4, which
differs from C3 by a single methyl group (21). It was previously
shown that C3, but not C4, at nanomolar concentrations can
sensitize human cancer cells to TRAIL or TNF-a–induced
apoptosis (21). To observe potential sensitizing effects, NSAIDs
were used at a lower concentration (100 Amol/L) for HCT116 cells.
We found that these compounds alone, even at micromolar
concentrations, did not have any growth inhibitory or apoptotic
effects on colon cancer cells (Fig. 4A and data not shown).
However, only 100 nmol/L of C3 was sufficient to markedly
enhance NSAID-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells, with the
percentage of apoptotic cells increasing from 32% to 61% and from
22% to 59% after treatment for 48 h with 100 Amol/L sulindac
and 250 Amol/L indomethacin, respectively (Fig. 4A). In contrast,
the control C4 compound did not have any effect on apoptosis
(Fig. 4A). Similar observations were also made in HT29 and DLD1
colon cancer cells (Fig. 4A). Combinations of C3 with sulindac

member Bid, which is cleaved by caspases in the cytoplasm (31).
The truncated tBid can translocate to the mitochondria to induce
cytochrome c release (31). We found that Bid was indeed cleaved
and tBid was enriched in the mitochondria after sulindac
treatment (Fig. 3D). However, the cleavage and translocation of
Bid were also detected at the same level in the BAX-KO and SMACKO cells (Fig. 3D), which are deficient in NSAID-induced apoptosis
and cytochrome c release (25, 26), excluding Bid as the candidate
for regulating SMAC-mediated cytochrome c release. We also
found that Bim, another BH3-only protein and a caspase substrate
that can translocate to the mitochondria (32), underwent similar
proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 3D). Although the shorter forms of Bim
were enriched in the mitochondria of sulindac-treated HCT116
cells, no difference was observed in the BAX-KO and SMAC-KO
cells (Fig. 3D). Therefore, Bid and Bim did not seem to play a role in
NSAID-induced and SMAC-mediated cytochrome c release.
SMAC mimetics potentiate NSAID-induced apoptosis in
colon cancer cells. The critical role of SMAC in NSAID-induced
apoptosis suggests that manipulation of the SMAC pathway may
improve the effects of NSAIDs. The requirement of the AVPI

(50–100 Amol/L) or indomethacin (100–250 Amol/L) at different
concentrations all led to 80% to 120% increase in apoptosis in
HCT116 cells (data not shown). To verify these results, we also
analyzed an independent set of active and control SMAC mimetic
compounds, GT-T and GT-C, and observed similar results (Fig. 4A).
Analysis of apoptosis using Annexin V/propidium iodide staining
confirmed that NSAID-induced apoptosis is enhanced by the active
C3 or GT-T compound but not by the control C4 or GT-C
compound (Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, colony formation
assay results showed that combinations of NSAIDs with the
active compounds were much more effective in inhibiting longterm survival of HCT116 and HT29 cells compared with NSAIDs
alone or their combinations with the control compounds (Fig. 4B).
Over 50% of the cells that could not be killed by sulindac or
indomethacin alone were eliminated by the combination with C3
or GT-T (Fig. 4B). These results showed strong cooperative effects
of NSAIDs and SMAC mimetics in killing colon cancer cells.
SMAC mimetics overcome NSAID resistance in the SMACKO and BAX-KO cells. The majority of HCT116 cells surviving
from NSAID treatment contain BAX mutations and are defective in
SMAC release (25, 26). Acquired NSAID resistance was found to be
associated with overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins (33, 34). Because SMAC functions downstream of Bax
and other Bcl-2 family members, we asked whether manipulating
SMAC can restore NSAID sensitivity in NSAID-resistant colon
cancer cells that are deficient in Bax or SMAC. It was shown that
cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, SMAC can bypass the requirement of activating Bcl-2 family proteins to activate caspases
(17, 19). We therefore transiently transfected a cytosolic SMAC
expression construct into the BAX-KO cells (Fig. 5A), which are
completely resistant to NSAIDs even at very high concentrations

(26). To maximize the apoptotic effect so that molecular markers of
apoptosis could be analyzed, we used a higher concentration of
sulindac (200 Amol/L) or indomethacin (800 Amol/L) than those
used for other cell lines to treat the BAX-KO cells. We found that
sulindac-induced apoptosis was indeed restored by the cytosolic
SMAC in the BAX-KO cells (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, the active SMAC
mimetic compounds C3 and GT-T, but not the control compounds
C4 and GT-C, also restored apoptosis induced by sulindac or
indomethacin in both the BAX-KO and SMAC-KO cells (Fig. 5B).
These results were confirmed by analysis of apoptosis using
Annexin V/propidium iodide staining (Supplementary Fig. S2).
They suggest that activation of the apoptotic pathway by SMAC or
SMAC mimetics can overcome NSAID resistance in colon cancer
cells.
The effects of SMAC mimetics depend on caspase-3 and
involve cytochrome c release. We then investigated the
mechanisms by which SMAC mimetics potentiate NSAID-induced
apoptosis. We found that 100 Amol/L sulindac failed to induce
robust caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation in HCT116 cells
(Fig. 6A), consistent with the low level of apoptosis induced by
sulindac at this concentration (Fig. 4A). However, in combination
with SMAC mimetic compounds, 100 Amol/L sulindac strongly
induced accumulation of active caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Fig. 6A).
Although sulindac even at 200 Amol/L could not induce caspase
processing in the BAX-KO cells, SMAC mimetics rescued caspase-3
and caspase-9 activation in these cells (Fig. 6B). In agreement with
the regulation of cytochrome c release by SMAC, treatment of
HCT116 cells with sulindac combined with the active SMAC
mimetics markedly enhanced cytochrome c release in HCT116 cells
and also restored cytochrome c release in the BAX-KO cells (Fig. 6A
and B). To test whether these effects of SMAC mimetics require

Discussion

caspase-3 activation, caspase-3 siRNA was transfected into cells
before the combination treatment. Caspase-3 knockdown resulted
in a significant reduction of apoptosis in the cells treated with the
combinations of sulindac and SMAC mimetics, which was much
more pronounced than the reduction of apoptosis seen in the cells
treated with sulindac alone (Fig. 6C), indicating that the sensitizing
effects of the SMAC mimetics are at least in part mediated by
caspase-3. Furthermore, caspase-3 knockdown also led to attenuation of cytochrome c release induced by the combination of
sulindac and SMAC mimetics (Fig. 6D). These results suggested
that SMAC mimetics potentiate NSAID-induced apoptosis and
overcome NSAID resistance by promoting caspase-3 activation,
thereby enhancing cytochrome c release.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (1). January 1, 2008

In this study, we found that SMAC release and cytochrome c
release proceed through different time courses during NSAIDinduced apoptosis, with bulk of the SMAC release occurring much
earlier compared with that of cytochrome c release. The majority of
cytochrome c release was abolished in the SMAC-KO cells,
suggesting that SMAC plays an important role in promoting
cytochrome c release and full execution of NSAID-induced
apoptosis. Studies by other groups also showed that the release
of different mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins is coordinated and
occurs through different time courses (35). The IAP-interacting
activity of SMAC, which is mediated by the N-terminal AVPI
domain, is critical for its ability to promote caspase activation and

lower concentrations (120 Amol/L sulindac and 500 Amol/L
indomethacin), we also detected f10% apoptosis in BAX-KO cells
(data not shown). The mechanistic studies showed that SMAC
mimetics enhanced NSAID-induced caspase-3 activation and
cytochrome c release, thereby promoting the feedback loop for
full execution of NSAID-induced apoptosis. Importantly, the effects
of SMAC mimetics are caspase-3–dependent, suggesting that
caspases play a major role in mediating this feedback loop, also
reinforcing that the sensitizing effects are not due to off-target
activities of SMAC mimetics (21). It will be of interest to test
whether previously reported activities of SMAC mimetics also
operate through similar feedback mechanisms.
Extensive efforts have been made toward developing therapeutic
agents through manipulation of apoptotic pathways (43). For
example, ABT-737, a compound that mimics the BH3 domains of
Bcl-2 family proteins, has shown great promise in early preclinical
studies (44). However, manipulation of apoptotic pathways for
chemoprevention has not been extensively explored. Our results
suggest that SMAC mimetics are potentially useful as sensitizers for
NSAIDs and possibly for other chemopreventive agents by boosting
their proapoptotic activities and also by restoring apoptosis in
otherwise resistant neoplastic cells. It is worth noting that the
concentrations of SMAC mimetics were less than one of 1,000 of
those of NSAIDs used in our study. The side effects of NSAIDs,
presumably caused by high drug doses used in prevention studies,
have presented a significant challenge for using these agents for
cancer prevention (4). It is possible that combinations of NSAIDs
with SMAC mimetics will help to enhance chemopreventive efficacy,
while reducing dose and decreasing toxicity. This possibility can be
tested using animal models, such as Apc Min/+ mice.

cytochrome c release during NSAID-induced apoptosis. Because
IAP inhibition occurs in the cytoplasm whereas cytochrome c is
located in the mitochondria before its release, a feedback loop
involving protein translocation seems to drive the events leading to
cytochrome c release. Our previous study has described a similar
function of SMAC in DNA damage–induced apoptosis mediated by
the BH3-only protein PUMA (28). However, the requirement of
SMAC for full execution of apoptosis does not seem to be general,
as only few classes of agents among a number of stimuli tested,
including NSAIDs, PUMA, and TRAIL, were found to be dependent
on SMAC to induce apoptosis (25). Under different conditions, it is
possible that cytochrome c plays a major role in driving this
feedback amplification loop (36).
Using siRNA and inhibitor approaches, we showed that caspase3 activation is a critical event in this feedback loop. Several
previous studies have also shown the functions of other caspases,
including caspase-2 and caspase-7, in promoting mitochondrial
events during apoptosis (37–39). However, the link between
caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release remains to be
identified. We did not detect any mitochondrial accumulation of
caspase-3 in HCT116 cells undergoing sulindac-induced apoptosis
(data not shown), excluding the possibility that caspase-3 itself
directly induces cytochrome c release. Analysis of proapoptotic
caspase substrates ruled out the BH3-only proteins Bid and Bim as
the potential candidates, because their cleavage and translocation
were intact in the BAX-KO and SMAC-KO cells that are deficient in
NSAID-induced apoptosis. Several other proteins that can translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondria and promote
cytochrome c release remain to be examined. It is also possible
that more than one protein mediate the intermediate steps
between caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release. To identify
the mediators of this feedback loop, it might be useful to compare
the mitochondrial components in the wild-type and SMAC-KO cells
using an unbiased proteomic approach.
Our results obtained from two independent sets of compounds
showed for the first time that SMAC mimetics can greatly
potentiate the anticancer effects of NSAIDs in both short-term
apoptotic and long-term clonogenic survival assays. Other studies
have described similar effects of SMAC and SMAC mimetics on
chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation (17, 40–42). SMAC
mimetics not only greatly enhanced the apoptotic effects of
sulindac and indomethacin in colon cancer cells with different
genetic backgrounds but also restored apoptosis in the NSAIDresistant SMAC-KO and BAX-KO cells. Our data on BAX-KO cells
were obtained using higher concentrations of NSAIDs (200 Amol/L
