BACKGROUND: Clonal evolution is frequently detected in patients developing resistance to imatinib. The outcome of
patients with clonal evolution treated with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors is not known. METHODS: The
authors analyzed the outcome of 177 CML patients after second tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. RESULTS: Ninetyfive patients were in chronic phase, 30 had clonal evolution, 28 were in accelerated phase (AP), and 24 were in AP
plus clonal evolution. Major cytogenetic response rates were 58%, 54%, 28%, and 13%; 2-year overall survival (OS)
rates were 86%, 73%, 68%, and 33%; and 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 69%, 67%, 31%, and 8%, respectively. The hematologic and cytogenetic response rates, OS, and EFS were no different between patients in chronic
phase with clonal evolution and patients with chronic phase and no clonal evolution. However, clonal evolution had a
significant adverse impact when associated with other features of AP. On multivariate analysis, clonal evolution had
no independently significant effect on achieving major cytogenetic response on the second generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitors. The factors predicting increasing major cytogenetic response to second generation tyrosine kinase
inhibitors were prior achievement of major cytogenetic response with imatinib, higher hemoglobin levels, no splenomegaly, lower percentage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases, and no prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal evolution constitutes a heterogeneous entity with variable outcome with second generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, with trisomy 8, chromosome 17, and complex abnormalities having the worst outcome, regardless of
the number of metaphases involved. The molecular events behind these abnormalities and potential therapeutic

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder that typically evolves through 3 clinical
phases: chronic phase, accelerated phase (AP), and blastic phase. The hallmark of CML, the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, is an abnormally short chromosome 22 that results from a balanced translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11.2). The translocation leads to the formation of a hybrid gene BCR-ABL that encodes for the fusion protein Bcr-Abl with its characteristic
deregulated tyrosine kinase activity.1
Clonal evolution in CML denotes the presence of a variety of additional, nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities
besides the Ph chromosome. Clonal evolution occurs in approximately 30% of patients in AP and about 80% patients in
blastic phase.2,3 Although clonal evolution may involve any abnormality within any chromosome, the most commonly
reported abnormalities include double Ph, chromosome 17 abnormalities, and trisomy 8. Clonal evolution has been considered a criterion for AP of CML, particularly when it appears during the course of therapy. In this setting, clonal evolution is associated with a poor prognosis.3-11 The prognostic significance of clonal evolution may vary with different
therapeutic modalities. The outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplant may not be adversely affected by clonal

evolution, with a reported long-term survival rate of 60%
if clonal evolution was the only feature of AP.12,13 Interferon (IFN)-a therapy caused complete resolution of clonal evolution in 46% patients, with a better response rate
if clonal evolution was not associated with other features
of AP, although patients with abnormalities of chromosome 17 had a worse outcome compared with those with
other abnormalities.8 In patients treated with IFN-a and
low-dose Ara-C, 3-year survival rates of 67% were
observed if clonal evolution was the only feature of AP disease, compared with 22% if other features of AP were
present (P < .01).14 With imatinib, the outcome of
patients with clonal evolution is significantly inferior
compared with those without clonal evolution.7
Patients who develop resistance to imatinib frequently develop clonal evolution as a mechanism of resistance (or associated with resistance).15-17 The second
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib are effective in patients with CML after failure of imatinib.18,19 The significance of different chromosomal
abnormalities associated with clonal evolution for the outcome after therapy with second generation tyrosine kinase
inhibitors is unknown. Herein, we analyzed the response
to therapy and long-term outcome after second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with
CML with clonal evolution after imatinib failure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
All patients with Phþ CML in chronic phase or AP
treated with dasatinib or nilotinib at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between November 2003 and August 2007 were included in this analysis.
Criteria for AP included the presence of any of the following10: 1) 15% to 29% peripheral or bone marrow blasts,
2) 20% peripheral or marrow basophils, 3) 30%
peripheral or marrow blasts plus promyelocytes, 4) platelets <100  109/L unrelated to therapy, or 5) clonal evolution. Loss of chromosome Y, complex or variant Ph
abnormalities, or chromosomal changes in Ph cells were
not considered clonal evolution. All patients were treated
with either dasatinib or nilotinib after imatinib failure as
part of a series of phase 1 and phase 2 studies at various
doses as previously reported. These studies were approved
by the institutional review board (IRB), and all patients
signed IRB-approved informed consents.

2674

Evaluation of Patients
All patients had a history and physical exam, complete
blood counts, and blood chemistry before the start of therapy and every month for the first 3 months, then every
3 months until 12 months from the start of therapy, and
then every 6 months. Cytogenetic response was assessed
by G-banding assessed in the bone marrow with at least
20 metaphases counted. Molecular response was assessed
by real-time polymerase chain reaction as previously
reported.20 Both cytogenetic and molecular response
assessments were performed at baseline, every 3 months
for the first 12 months, and then every 6 months.
Response and relapse criteria were as previously
reported.21,22
Statistical Analysis
Overall survival (OS) was determined from the start of
therapy with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors
to death from any cause or last follow-up. Event-free survival (EFS) was measured from the start of each therapy
until loss of complete hematologic response or major
cytogenetic response, progression to the AP or blastic
phase, or death from any cause during treatment. Chisquare test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Spearman rank
correlation coefficient were used as appropriate to determine the inter-relationship of various parameters for this
study. Survival curves were built using the Kaplan and
Meier method, and differences in survival of subgroups
were assessed by the log-rank test.23 Multivariate analyses
were done to analyze the independent prognostic significance of various chromosomal abnormalities.

RESULTS
Among a total of 177 patients treated during this period,
54 (31%) had clonal evolution at the start of therapy with
second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Twenty-four
(44%) of the 54 had clonal evolution in addition to other
AP criteria, and 30 (56%) had clonal evolution as the only
feature of AP. Among the others, 95 were in chronic
phase, and 28 had other features of AP but no clonal evolution. All patients were previously treated with imatinib
unsuccessfully. The median CML duration at the start of
therapy of second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors
was 69 months (range, 4-241 months), and median
follow-up after start of second generation tyrosine kinase
inhibitors was 28.5 months (range, 5-53 months). Table
1 summarizes the characteristics of all patients.

In 30 of 54 (56%) patients with clonal evolution (22
of 30 with clonal evolution alone and 8 of 24 with clonal
evolution plus other AP features), there was a single additional chromosomal abnormality (besides the Ph chromosome) identified, with double Ph being the most common
finding (Tables 2 and 3). The other 24 (44%) patients
had >1 chromosomal abnormality besides the Ph chromosome, usually involving multiple abnormalities
(median 2 abnormalities; range, 2-17).
The absence or presence of clonal evolution in itself
was a significant factor for response to treatment and survival; with major cytogenetic response rates of 53% versus
35% (P ¼ .04), 2-year OS of 82% versus 56% (P <
.001), and 2-year EFS of 60% versus 40% (P ¼ .04),
respectively, for patients without clonal evolution and
with clonal evolution. Analyzing the outcome by individual groups, in the patients with active disease (ie, patients
not in complete hematologic response at start of therapy),
60 of the 73 (82%) patients in chronic phase, 21 of the 23
(91%) with clonal evolution alone, 21 of the 28 (75%) in

group comparison was done (Table 4). A major cytogenetic response was achieved in 55 of the 95 (58%)
patients in chronic phase, 16 of the 30 (54%) with clonal
evolution alone, 8 of the 28 (28%) in AP, and 3 of the 24
(13%) with clonal evolution plus other features of AP disease (P < .001), but the difference was not significant
when subgroup comparison was done, as shown in Table
4. When comparing patients in chronic phase versus
patients in chronic phase plus clonal evolution, the
complete hematologic response rates were 79% versus
87% (P ¼ .61), major cytogenetic response rates were
58% versus 54% (P ¼ .82), and complete cytogenetic
response rates were 53% versus 47% (P ¼ .71), respectively. Similarly, comparing patients in AP without clonal
evolution versus patients in AP with clonal evolution, the
complete hematologic response rates were 71% versus
46% (P ¼ .11), major cytogenetic response rates were
28% versus 13% (P ¼ .28), and complete cytogenetic
response rates were 21% versus 13% (P ¼ .63), respectively. When comparing patients with chronic phase to
those with clonal evolution alone, there was no significant
difference in the 2-year OS and EFS (Table 4). Similarly,
there was no difference in EFS between AP versus AP plus
clonal evolution (Fig. 1). However, patients with AP plus

clonal evolution had a significantly lower 2-year OS than
those with AP alone (P ¼ .004).
We then analyzed whether various features of clonal
evolution had different prognostic impact. The OS and
EFS were worse with increasing numbers of cells/metaphases showing Ph positivity (90% or more vs less). However, within the patients with clonal evolution, the
percentage of metaphases involved with clonal evolution
had no statistically significant impact on major cytogenetic response, OS, or EFS albeit with a trend for a worse
outcome for patients with >90% metaphases with clonal
evolution (Table 5). Regarding the different chromosomal abnormalities seen, when presenting as individual
abnormalities, the 2-year survival probability was 11% for
patients with chromosome 8 abnormalities, 35% for
chromosome 17 involvement, 57% for double Phþ cells,

52% for patients with other chromosomal translocations,
56% for other chromosomal abnormalities, 27% for complex chromosomal abnormalities, and 39% for 2 other
chromosomal abnormalities (Table 6).
BCR-ABL mutations were present in 67 (57%) of
the 117 patients in whom sequencing was done, and
mutations were almost equally distributed (33%-46%) in
all 4 groups (chronic phase or clonal evolution alone or
AP or clonal evolution þ AP, P ¼ .13, Table 1). The
mutations were varied, and the most common observed
were G250E mutation in 9 patients (6 in chronic phase
and 3 in AP alone); M351T mutation in 4 patients in
chronic phase; and T315I mutation in 3 patients in
chronic phase. There were 3 patients in chronic phase and
2 patients in the clonal evolution alone group who had 2
coexisting mutations: M351T þ F317L, T315I þ
M351T, and V299L þ F486S in chronic phase patients,
and F311L þ E453K, and G250E þ F359I in patients
with clonal evolution alone. Within the 54 patients with
clonal evolution (clonal evolution alone and clonal evolution plus other AP features), there was no statistically significant difference in major cytogenetic response (30% vs
37%, P ¼ .74), OS (43% vs 73%, P ¼ .21), or EFS (27%
vs 53%, P ¼ .51), respectively, between patients with and
without mutations, but there was a trend for inferior
survival for patients with mutations (Table 6).
On univariate analysis, other factors besides clonal
evolution that were associated with inferior OS or EFS
were presence of splenomegaly, hemoglobin <10 g/dL,

2678

platelet count <100  109/L), basophils >5% or blasts
5% in peripheral blood or bone marrow, stage of CML
(AP), and hematological resistance to imatinib therapy.
On multivariate analysis, clonal evolution did not show
an independently significant effect on achieving major
cytogenetic response on the second generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitors. The factors predicting increasing major
cytogenetic response to second generation tyrosine kinase
inhibitors were identified as prior achievement of major
cytogenetic response with imatinib, higher hemoglobin
levels, no splenomegaly, lower percentage of Phþ metaphases, and no prior chemotherapy (eg, cytarabine, decitabine). Prior achievement of major cytogenetic response
to imatinib and lower number of marrow blasts were significantly associated with better EFS. For OS, the positive
factors were higher hemoglobin, lower marrow blast percent, and no thrombocytopenia using a Cox proportional
hazard model. Clonal evolution was not independently
associated with an inferior EFS or OS.

DISCUSSION
The adverse prognosis conferred by the presence of clonal
evolution has been demonstrated in patients treated with
imatinib. O’Dwyer et al7 reported on 71 patients with
CML in AP treated with imatinib, of whom 15 had clonal
evolution alone, 32 had AP features without clonal evolution, and 24 had clonal evolution plus other features of
AP. Major cytogenetic response was achieved with

ease. The rates of major cytogenetic response were 66%,
54%, 40%, and 33%, (P ¼ .5), respectively. After a median follow-up of 30 months, 2-year survival rates were
92%, 77%, 71%, and 46%, respectively. In a multivariate
analysis, clonal evolution was not independently associated with the probability of achieving major cytogenetic
response or complete cytogenetic response, but it was an
independent poor prognostic factor for survival. In the

present analysis, the presence of clonal evolution did not
show similar prognostic impact for patients treated with
second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors mostly after
failure of imatinib therapy.
Our report represents the first systematic analysis of
the significance of clonal evolution in the outcome after
therapy with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Our results suggest that for CML patients with clonal
evolution but no other features of AP treated with a
second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor after imatinib failure, the hematologic and cytogenetic response
rates, OS, and EFS are no different than for patients
with chronic phase and no clonal evolution. Clonal
evolution, however, has a significant adverse impact
when associated with other features of AP. However,
in a multivariate analysis, clonal evolution does not
have an independent prognostic impact on the outcome of patients. This suggests that outcome after second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors is driven by
BCR-ABL inhibition, and the molecular events associated with clonal evolution have relatively little impact
on the outcome after therapy, at least in the chronic
phase. In contrast, in the AP, the presence of clonal
evolution adversely affects outcome, particularly OS.
Although the response rate and EFS are not statistically
significant in AP, the trends in cytogenetic response
rate and EFS suggest an adverse impact of clonal evolution. These are probably not statistically significant
because of the small sample size. The molecular mechanisms associated with clonal evolution remain to be
identified, and they are likely to be heterogeneous as a
variety of different chromosomal abnormalities are
associated with clonal evolution, frequently coexisting
in the same patient. Unraveling the different molecular
mechanisms involved in this process may help us better
understand the pathophysiology of CML progression.
We also found that trisomy 8, chromosome 17, or
complex chromosomal abnormalities had worse 2-year OS
and EFS, whereas double Ph chromosome, other translocations, other clonal abnormalities, or the percentage of cells
showing clonal evolution had no significant impact on
EFS/OS. This might be an oversimplification of the complicated process that is clonal evolution, as there were 44%
patients who had >1 chromosomal abnormality, and we
here are considering each chromosomal abnormality as if it
existed alone. Yet it gives us an idea that chromosome 8
abnormalities have worst outcome followed by complex
abnormalities, chromosome 17 abnormalities, and abnormalities involving >1 chromosome.

It has been previously reported that mutations may
occur more frequently among patients with clonal evolution.24 This association might represent further manifestation of the genomic instability that has been reported in
patients with CML.25 Interestingly, in our series the presence of kinase domain mutations had little prognostic
impact on the response to second generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, although there is a trend for inferior OS
and EFS.
In conclusion, clonal evolution in CML constitutes
a heterogeneous entity with variable outcome with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. As a
group, patients with clonal evolution have inferior outcome with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
and the presence of other features of AP further worsens
the outcome. However, other clinical features are mainly
responsible for the inferior outcome seen among patients
with clonal evolution. The molecular events behind the
different clonal evolution categories and the potential
therapeutic approaches directed at them need to be
defined.
