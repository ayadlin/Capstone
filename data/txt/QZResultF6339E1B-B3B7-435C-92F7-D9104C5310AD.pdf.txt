BACKGROUND. Single-agent gemcitabine and vinorelbine have activity in treatment of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The combination of gemcitabine plus
vinorelbine has activity against several forms of metastatic carcinoma with acceptable toxicity. This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of gemcitabine
plus vinorelbine in advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.

METHODS. A single academic center performed this phase II trial. Eligible patients
had unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas, Eastern Cooperative Group
performance status of 0–2, adequate organ function, and 1 prior regimen.
Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 was given over 90 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day
cycle after administration of vinorelbine 25 mg/m2. Dosing schedule was modified for toxicity (doses constant but administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day

RESULTS. The study accrued 40 patients, and 248 dosing cycles were administered (range, 1–32). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Of 9 episodes of grade
4 toxicities, 8 were hematologic. Of 38 episodes of grade 3 toxicity, 24 were hemaresponse (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at >4 months. There
has been 1 CR lasting >1 year in a patient with high-grade pleomorphic spindlecell sarcoma.

CONCLUSIONS. Gemcitabine given by a fixed-dose rate of infusion combined with
vinorelbine was associated with clinically meaningful rates of disease control in
patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. Toxicity was acceptable. This study
contributed to data that have supported the administration of fixed-dose rate
gemcitabine-based drug regimens in soft-tissue sarcomas. Cancer 2007;109:

balance disease control with acceptable tolerability
and minimal negative impact on patient performance status, are worthy of development for clinical
use.
Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine analog with activity
in a broad spectrum of solid tumors. Single-agent
response rates that use gemcitabine in advanced sarcoma have been reported from 4% to 18%.6–9
Response rates for gemcitabine specifically in leiomyosarcoma have been reported as high as 53%
alone or in combination with docetaxel.9–10
Clinical activity of gemcitabine depends on formation of the metabolite gemcitabine triphosphate and
data suggest that the rate of gemcitabine triphosphate
accumulation is saturated at plasma levels of 10–
20 lmol/L of gemcitabine.11–12 This concentration is
achieved when gemcitabine is administered at a fixeddose rate of 6–10 mg/m2 per minute.11,13 The optimal
infusion rate of gemcitabine in clinical practice has
yet to be clearly defined. An initial study of a fixeddose rate of infusion of gemcitabine demonstrated
improved outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer
when compared with standard 30-minute infusion.13
A more recent study that evaluated the role of a
gemcitabine fixed-dose rate of infusion in pancreatic
cancer showed equivalence with standard-rate infusion.14 Experience with single-agent gemcitabine administered at a fixed-dose rate of infusion suggests
benefit in treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma.9
Vinorelbine is a semisynthetic derivate of vinblastine, which is well tolerated and has shown activity in soft-tissue sarcoma.15 The combination of
gemcitabine with vinorelbine has known activity in
treatment of lung and breast carcinomas.16–20 The
primary toxicity observed has been myelosuppression, with febrile neutropenia reported infrequently.
To attempt to improve upon response rates of
single-agent gemcitabine, without altering the favorable toxicity profile, we have explored the use of
gemcitabine in combination with vinorelbine administered at a fixed-dose rate of infusion to patients
with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
The following eligibility criteria were required for
patient entry, histologically confirmed, unresectable,
or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma; an Eastern Cooperative Group Performance Status of 2; no more than
1 prior regimen of chemotherapy for advanced disease; adequate organ function defined as bilirubin
<1.8, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGOT/SGPT)

<2.5 3 upper limits of normal (ULN) (<5 3 ULN if hepatic disease involvement present); creatinine
<1.5 3 ULN; absolute neutrophil count >1.5 3 109/L;
platelets >100 3 109/L; absence of pregnancy or lactation; no other active primary malignancy; and no
other severe and/or life-threatening medical condition including classes III or IV cardiac dysfunction as
defined by the New York Heart Association.
The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center institutional review board approved this study. All patients
provided written informed consent in accordance
with federal and institutional guidelines.

Treatment Plan
Patients received vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 infused
intravenously over approximately 10 minutes and
gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 infused intravenously over
approximately 90 minutes on Day 1 and Day 8 of a
21-day cycle (or for selected patients, on Day 1 and
Day 15 of a 28-day cycle). All patients were assessed
within 14 days of enrollment and during treatment
by physical examination, by assessment of Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, by
laboratory tests (complete blood cell count with differential, liver function tests, electrolytes, and creatinine). Patients underwent imaging by computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) at baseline and after every 2 cycles to assess
their response to treatment. Chemotherapy continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Patients who required radiotherapy or
surgery for additional disease control were removed
from the study. Toxicity was graded according to the
National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria
(NCICTC).

Dose Modification for Nonhematologic Toxicity
If grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity occurred at any
point, treatment was held until the patient’s condition resolved to grade 1, and then treatment was
resumed at the same dose and schedule. If grade 3
toxicity recurred, then treatment was held until resolution to grade 1 and then restarted as follows: the
cycle length was changed to 28 days, and treatment
was given at the same doses on Day 1 and Day 15. If
grade 3 toxicity recurred on this new schedule,
then the dose of both gemcitabine and vinorelbine
was reduced by 25%, and treatment given on Day 1
and Day 15 of a 28-day cycle. If an additional grade
3 toxicity occurred, the patient was removed from
the study. No dose modification was implemented
for grade 1 or grade 2 nonhematologic toxicity.

Dose Modification for Hematologic Toxicity
If grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia was
present on the day of planned therapy, treatment
was held until the absolute neutrophil count recovered to at least 1000 and platelet count recovered to
at least 75,000. Treatment could be restarted as follows: the cycle length was changed to 28 days, and
treatment was given at the same doses on Day 1 and
Day 15. If grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia recurred, the dose of both gemcitabine and
vinorelbine was reduced by 25%, and treatment was
administered on Day 1 and Day 15 of a 28-day cycle.
If grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia
recurred despite this dose and schedule modification, the patient was removed from the study. Hematopoietic cytokine supportive care was allowed at the
discretion of the treating physician. No dose modification was required for grade 3 or grade 4 anemia.
Dose Modification for Elevation in Total Bilirubin
If bilirubin elevations were noted, the dose of gemcitabine remained the same, and the dose of vinorelbine was modified as follows: When total bilirubin
reached 2.1–3.0 mg/dL, then the vinorelbine dose
was decreased to 15 mg/m2, or when total bilirubin
reached >3.0 mg/dL, then the vinorelbine dose was
decreased to 7.5 mg/m2.
Response Criteria
Objective Response was defined as complete response
or partial response by Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumors (RECIST).21 Clinical Benefit was
defined either as objective response or RECISTdefined stable disease for a minimum of 4 months.
Progression-free survival at 6 months for first-line
therapy and at 3 months for second-line therapy
have been proposed as reasonable reference values
for clinical benefit in phase II trials in soft-tissue sarcomas.22 Because our patient population was mixed
with regard to number of prior therapies, stable disease for 4 months or longer was included in our definition of clinical benefit for this study.
Statistical Analysis
The study was structured with a 2-stage design, as
proposed by Simon, that would allow early study closure if the overall clinical benefit rate was unacceptably low.23 In the first stage, 16 patients would be
entered. If 3 or more clinical benefit responses
(CBRs) were seen, then an additional 24 patients
would be entered into the study for a total of 40. If
10 or more CBRs were observed among the 40 eligible patients, then the conclusion would be that the
CBR with combined gemcitabine and vinorelbine

1865

was consistent with a rate of 35%. In selecting this
design, we reasoned that if the true response rate
was 35%, the probability of stopping early and rejecting combined gemcitabine and vinorelbine as a promising regimen was 0.05, and the probability of
declaring it promising was 0.91. An exact 2-stage binomial confidence interval for the overall response
rate was determined according to the method of
Atkinson and Brown.24 Exact binomial confidence
intervals were provided for the overall hematological
and nonhematological toxicity rates. Progression-free
survival (PFS) was defined as the length of time from
the date when study treatment began to the date of
documented progression or date of death, whichever
occurred first. Overall survival (OS) was defined as
the length of time from the date when study treatment started to the date of death from any cause.
PFS and OS percentages and standard errors were
obtained by using the Kaplan-Meier method and
Greenwood formula, respectively.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Time of Reporting
This phase II study was activated on February 19,
2003 and closed to further accrual on April 13, 2005,
with a final accrual of 40 eligible patients. Details of
baseline characteristics, including number of prior
regimens, grade, and histology, with leiomyosarcoma
as the most common (47.5%), are shown in Table 1.
Results are reported at a median follow-up of 6.9
months for survivors.
Tolerability of Gemcitabine 1 Navelbine in This
Population
Treatment-related toxicities are summarized in Table
2. Twenty (50%; 90% CI, 36% to 64%) patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities. The most
common toxicity was grade 3 neutropenia. Febrile
neutropenia was uncommon, occurring in <5% of
cycles administered.
Nine (23%; 90% CI, 12% to 36%) patients experienced grade 3 to 4 nonhematological toxicities. Ten
(25%) patients had their treatment schedules changed from days 1, 8 to days 1, 15. Five of these 10
(50%) patients underwent schedule change because
of hematological toxicities. No treatment-related
deaths were seen.
Antitumor Efficacy
The rate of clinical benefit response was defined as the
proportion of patients with complete or partial objective responses or patients with stable disease for 4
months. All 40 patients were assessable for efficacy.

disease for at least 4 months (n ¼ 5). Of the 5
patients with objective response, 3 patients had metastatic leiomyosarcoma, 2 of these of uterine origin.
The other 2 responders were a 71-year-old female
with high-grade myxofibrosarcoma of the thigh with
pulmonary metastasis and a 25-year-old male with
metastatic small round blue cell malignancy, which
originated in the soft tissues around the knee and
spread to the lungs and pelvic lymph nodes. The latter patient had previously received ifosfamide and
Adriamycin-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting and developed pulmonary metastasis within
4 months of completing adjuvant therapy. Gemcitabine
with vinorelbine was first-line therapy for advanced
disease in all 5 of these patients.

histologic diagnoses as follows: unclassified highgrade spindle cell sarcoma, high-grade myxofibrosarcoma, high-grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma,
and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. One
of these 5 patients had received prior chemotherapy
for advanced disease. The median duration of clinical benefit for the 10 responding patients was
12.6 months (range, 4.1 months to 29.9 months). The
median duration of clinical benefit for the 5 patients
who achieved a complete or partial response was
16.1 months (range, 5.3 months to 29.9 months). The
median duration of clinical benefit for the 5 patients
who achieved stable disease sustained for at least
4 months was 9.6 months (range, 4.1 months to
20.9 months). The median time to progression for
the entire cohort was 3.4 months. The 6-month and

DISCUSSION
In the continuing challenge to find new effective
treatments for patients with advanced or metastatic
soft-tissue sarcomas, the combination of gemcitabine

and vinorelbine may have a role. In the current
study, this regimen has shown a clinical benefit rate
of 25% in a heterogeneous group of patients with
various histopathologic subtypes of metastatic softtissue sarcomas; importantly, this outpatient regimen
has been overall well tolerated. The high rates of
overall survival are particularly interesting, making
these results encouraging for this population of
patients with pretreated soft-tissue sarcomas.
Gemcitabine administered as a single agent has
been previously studied in patients with metastatic
soft-tissue sarcoma, with reported response rates
ranging from 4% to 18%.6–8 In these studies, gemcitabine was administered by means of a standard infusion rate of 30 minutes, independent of dose.
Pharmacokinetic data9 suggest that there may be a
pharmacologic advantage to dose-adjusted infusion
of 6 mg/m2 to 10 mg/m2. At this rate, the accumulation of the active metabolite, gemcitabine triphosphate, appears to be maximal, thus suggesting an
pharmacologic advantage to this regimen. When
used as a single agent administered at this dose rate,
gemcitabine has very encouraging rates of benefit
and objective response, particularly in leiomyosarcomas of uterine origin or those arising outside the
gastrointestinal tract.9 The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has shown promise in leiomyosarcomas and other histopathologic subtypes of softtissue sarcomas.10,25 In studies of the gemcitabine
and docetaxel combination reported to date, gemci-

tabine has been administered by a fixed-dose rate of
infusion. Response rates for leiomyosarcoma (LMS)
were reported to be 47% to 53% with a median duration of response of just over 5 months. When histologies other than LMS were included, response rates
were lower, (40% versus 10%), with a median duration of response for patients responding noted to be
7 months.26 An early report comparing gemcitabine
alone with gemcitabine plus docetaxel suggested
activity for both regimens, with patients experiencing a better overall response rate to the combination
regimen.27
Our current study adds to data that support the
activity of a fixed-dose rate of infusion for a gemcitabine-based regimen for patients with soft-tissue
sarcoma. The combination of gemcitabine plus vinorelbine was associated with an observed clinical benefit
rate of 25% when we included patients with durable
stable disease on treatment. This regimen was well tolerated and readily managed with adjustments to the
dose schedule without compromising the dose.
Although the observed response rate with the combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine is comparable
to that with single-agent gemcitabine, the median duration of response in this study of 12.6 months (range,
4.1 months to 29.9 months) for patients achieving clinical benefit is promising. This study was not statistically powered to draw any definitive conclusions on
the relative benefit of this treatment in specific histologic subtypes; however, responses were seen in a variety of high-grade tumors. The optimal regimen to
balance antitumor efficacy and toxicity in patients
with these incurable diseases will require additional
studies. It will also be important to identify subsets of
sarcomas that may be particularly sensitive to these
agents, given the fact that this regimen has induced
durable objective responses in a notable subset of
patients. Further molecular characterization of these
sensitive sarcomas will be required, as routine histopathology has not yielded any clues that would help
clinicians accurately prognosticate an outcome for
individual patients.
