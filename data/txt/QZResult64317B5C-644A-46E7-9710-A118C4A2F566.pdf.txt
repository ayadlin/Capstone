Abstract
mTOR activation is commonly caused by oncogenic mutations in RAS/RAF/
MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, and promotes cancer progression and therapeutic
resistance. However, mTOR inhibitors show limited single agent efficacy in patients.
mTOR inhibitors suppress tumor cell growth and angiogenesis, and have recently
been shown to induce death receptor/FADD-dependent apoptosis in colon cancers.
Using a panel of BRAF V600E and WT colorectal cancer cell lines and in vitro selected
resistant culture, and xenograft models, we demonstrate here that BRAFV600E confers
resistance to mTOR inhibitors. Everolimus treatment disrupts the S6K1-IRS-2/PI3K
negative feedback loop, leading to BRAF V600E-dependent activation of ERK and Mcl-1
stabilization in colon cancer cells, which in turn blocks the crosstalk from the death
receptor to mitochondria. Co-treatment with inhibitors to Mcl-1, PI3K, RAF or MEK
restores mTOR inhibitor-induced apoptosis by antagonizing Mcl-1 or abrogating ERK
activation in BRAFV600E cells. Our findings provide a rationale for genotype-guided
patient stratification and potential drug combinations to prevent or mitigate undesired
activation of survival pathways induced by mTOR inhibitors.

Introduction

mutations in mTOR or loss of function mutations in its
negative regulators TSC1/2 [4, 5]. The response to mTOR
inhibitor mono therapy is generally limited, and a number
of resistance mechanisms have been proposed [2, 6]. The
best known is the disruption of a negative feedback loop
upon mTORC1 inhibition which leads to AKT activation
through upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases or
substrates such as the IGF-1R/IRS-1 axis [7, 8]. However,
underlying genetic causes of differential response to
mTOR inhibitors remain largely undefined.
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK is another frequently
deregulated pathway in human cancer and coexists with
mTOR activation. Nearly half of all colon cancers contain
KRAS/BRAF mutations and the numbers are higher in
bigger or more advanced tumors. BRAFV600E is by far
the most common BRAF activating mutation in colorectal
cancers [9], and associated with several distinct clinicpathological parameters, such as proximal location,
mucinous histology, microsatellite instability (MSI),

The PI3K/AKT/ mTOR pathway is one of the most
deregulated pathways in human cancer. To date, only a
few PI3K-targeted drugs have emerged from clinical trials.
Allosteric mTOR inhibitors such as Rapamycin derivatives
or rapalogs are approved for clinical use in limited cancer
types, while a variety of less selective ATP-competitive
mTOR, PI3K or AKT or duel mTOR/PI3K multikinase
inhibitors are still in clinical development [1, 2].
Everolimus (RAD001) is an orally available derivative
of Rapamycin that binds to the mTOR cofactor FKBP12,
to inhibit mTORC1 complex as well as mTORC2
complex upon prolonged or high dose exposure [1].
Everolimus is FDA-approved for patients with advanced
renal cell carcinoma and currently in numerous clinical
trials for advanced solid tumors including colon cancer
[3]. Exceptional responses to Everolimus were reported
in a few patients whose cancers harbor rare activating

apoptosis in BRAF 600E/− cells were similar to parental
cells (600E/+) (data not shown). We also examined
apoptotic responses to Everolimus in isogenic CRC cell
lines with WT or mutant KRAS (G13D or G12V) [22, 23],
and mutant KRAS appears less well associated with
apoptosis resistance (Figure S1A).
We decided to focus on BRAF600E, and selected
a panel of ten colorectal cancer cell lines with either
WT or BRAF600E. These ten cell lines well represent
other driver mutations in colon cancer such as APC,
β-catenin, PIK3CA, p53, or SMAD4, but all have WT
KRAS (Table  S1). Remarkably, all five 600E cell lines
were found to be more resistant than any of the five BRAF
WT cells across a range of Everoliumus concentrations
in growth assays (Figure 1E). Everolimus (10–20 µM)
treatment induced 20–45% apoptosis and activation of
caspase-3 in BRAF WT cell lines within 48 hours, which
was strongly suppressed in 600E cell lines (Figure 1F).
Treatment of rapalogs activates ER stress and the
death receptor pathway in colon cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo [19]. Unexpectedly, induction of ER stress assessed
by p-eiF2a, or DR5, or inhibition of the prototypic
mTOR target S6K1 was similar in RKO, VACO432 cells
irrespective of BRAF status (Figures 1C, S1B). Consistent
with our previous findings [19], Everolimus at lower
doses (50 nM to 1 µM) induced a slight and reversible
growth inhibition in either BRAF WT or 600E cells, but
no apoptosis. These doses fully inhibited p-S6K1, but
unable to reduce p-4E-BP1, cap-dependent translation,
or induce ER stress and DR5 (Figures S1C and S1D).
These results demonstrate that BRAF600E is associated
with intrinsic resistance to Everolimus-induced apoptosis
in colon cancer cells without affecting the induction of ER
stress or DR5.

female gender, higher age and grade, and poor prognosis
after failure of standard chemotherapeutic regimens
[10, 11]. BRAFV600E selective inhibitors such as
Vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib (GSK2118436)
are FDA-approved for the treatment of unresectable
or metastatic melanoma. However, the response rate
in metastatic colorectal cancer harboring BRAFV600E
mutation is rather disappointing while the underlying
mechanisms are not well understood [11–13], and the
unresponsiveness might be caused by feedback activation
of EGFR signaling [14]. These findings demonstrate that
the efficacy of pharmacological targeting of an oncogenic
driver is strongly influenced by cancer- or cell typespecific signaling. The role of mutant BRAF in mTORi
response has not been determined.
Apoptosis induction is an important mechanism of
anticancer agents including targeted therapies [15, 16].
The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by DNA
damage or growth factor deprivation and regulated by
the Bcl-2 family of proteins and mitochondria [17]. The
extrinsic pathway is activated upon clustering of death
receptors such as DR5 and assembly of death-inducing
signaling complex (DISC) and caspase-8 processing.
In some cells, caspase-8-dependent cleavage of Bid
is required to amplify apoptotic signaling through the
mitochondria to induce apoptosis [18]. Anti-proliferation
and anti-angiogenesis activities of Rapalogs have been
well-established [1, 2], and our recent work demonstrated
that activation of ER stress and the DR5/FADD-dependent
apoptosis contributes significantly to their therapeutic
response in colon cancer cells and xenografts [19]. In
this study, we uncovered a BRAFV600E-dependent
mechanism underlying intrinsic and acquired resistance
to mTOR inhibitors. These findings provide potentially
useful biomarkers to help better design clinical trials and
rational drug combinations to circumvent resistance.

Mcl-1 upregulation in BRAF600E colon cancer
cells blocks apoptotic signaling from the death
receptor to mitochondria

Results
BRAF (V600E) colorectal cancer cells are
resistant to mTOR inhibitors

To investigate the mechanism of BRAF600Emediated apoptotic resistance, we analyzed Bcl-2 family
proteins including antiapoptotic members Bcl-2, Bcl-xL
and Mcl-1, and proapoptotic members Bax, Bak, PUMA,
NOXA, Bim and Bid. Everolimus treatment led to a
strong induction of Mcl-1 in BRAF600E (600E/+) RKO
and Vaco432 cells, associated with elevated p-ERK
(Thr202/Tyr204). In contrast, Mcl-1 and p-ERK was
reduced in BRAF WT cells (Figures 2A and S2A). Changes
in other Bcl-2 proteins did not differ significantly between
BRAF600E and WT RKO cells, while Bid cleavage was
consistent with activation of the death receptor pathway
(Figure S2A). Knockdown of Mcl-1 restored Everolimusinduced apoptosis in 600E cells (Figure 2B). In BRAF
WT (+/−) RKO cells, overexpression of Mcl-1 strongly
inhibited Everolimus-induced apoptosis (Figure 2C), as
well as knockdown of DR5 or Bid (Figure 2D). However,

Commonly used colon cancer cell lines frequently
contain mutations in KRAS/BRAF [20]. To study a
potential role of mutant KRAS/BRAF in Everolimus
response, we took the advantage of isogenic colon cancer
cell lines with targeted disruption of WT or mutant BRAF
alleles, or mutant KRAS knockin or knockout cells.
Using two pairs of isogenic colorectal cell lines RKO
and VACO432 with either WT (+/−) or mutant (600E/+)
BRAF [21], we found that WT cells (+/−) are more
sensitive to Everolimus-induced growth suppression.
(Figure 1A). Resistance of BRAF (600E/+) cells was
associated with a strong reduction in apoptosis, as
measured by nuclear fragmentation, flow cytometry and
caspase-3 activation (Figure 1C–1D). The sensitivity and

(Figure 2E). Compared to BRAF WT (+/−) RKO cells,
BRAF600E cells (600E/+, 600E/−) cells were both resistant
to apoptosis induced by the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor
Torin-1, and exhibited elevated p-ERK and Mcl-1 (Figure
S2D and S2E). These results suggest that Mcl-1 induction
by mTOR inhibitors is associated with ERK activation in
BRAF600E colon cancer cells, and blunts Bid-mediated
crosstalk between the death receptor and mitochondria.

knockdown of other BH3-only proteins PUMA or Bim
did not significantly affect Everolimus-induced apoptosis
(Figure S2B and S2C).
We extended the analysis to ten CRC cell lines, and
found Everolimus treatment-induced elevation in Mcl-1 and
p-ERK in all five BRAF600E cell lines. In contrast, Mcl-1
and p-ERK were either reduced or unchanged in all BRAF
WT cell lines. p-S6K1 was inhibited efficiently in all lines

BRAF600E-dependent activation of ERK leads
to increased Mcl-1 stability upon the disruption
of the S6K1-IRS-2/PI3K negative feedback by
Everolimus

mechanism for its elevation (Figure S3B). Mcl-1 is a fast
turn-over protein, and contains PEST (proline, glutamate,
serine, and threonine) motifs that are regulated by multiple
kinases, including ERK, and targeted by ubiquitylation
and proteasomal degradation [24–26]. The addition of
proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented Everolimusinduced decrease of Mcl-1 in BRAF WT cells, but
strongly elevated p-Mcl-1 (Ser159/Thr163) in BRAF600E
cells (Figure 3C), known ERK sites for inhibiting its
degradation [24–26]. We then directly analyzed the halflife of Mcl-1. In the presence of translation inhibitor
Cycloheximide (CHX), Mcl-1 levels sharply declined

We then examined if BRAF600E is responsible for
Everolimus resistance via Mcl-1 elevation. BRAF siRNA
knockdown restored apoptosis and caspase-3 activation,
and abrogated the elevation in p-ERK and Mcl-1
(Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). Everolimus treatment did
not increase, rather slightly decreased Mcl-1 mRNA
in BRAF600E cells, suggesting non-transcriptional

within 30 minutes in both WT and 600E RKO cells
(Figure 3D and 3E.). Mcl-1 decline was slowed down by
Everolimus treatment substantially more in 600E cells
than WT cells (Figure 3D), with a half-life extended from
20 minutes to over 100 minutes (Figure 3E).
Everolimus (RAD001) treatment inhibited S6KIRS-1 feedback, leading to PI3K-dependent ERK
activation in some cancer cells [27]. To test if BRAF600E
mediates ERK activation in colon cancer cells, we
overexpressed the mTOR-insensitive and constitutively
active form of S6K1 (HAS6K1 E389 delta CT) [28]

and mTOR-sensitive WT S6K1 in 600E cells. The
mTOR-insensitive S6K1 fully suppressed Everolimusinduced elevation in p-ERK and p-AKT, a PI3K target,
and partially recovered p-S6 (Figure 3F). The levels
of mRNA and protein of IRS-2, not IRS-1, increased
significantly more in BRAF600E cells after Everolimus
treatment (Figure S3C and S3D). IRS-2 siRNA abrogated
Everolimus-induced elevation in p-ERK or Mcl-1
(Figures 3G and S3A). Taken together, our results
demonstrate that Everolimus treatment disrupts the S6K1IRS-2/PI3K negative feedback in colon cancer cells and

Mcl-1 stabilization.

AS703026, also restored Everolimus-induced apoptosis
in BRAF600E RKO cells and prevented the induction
of p-ERK and/or Mcl-1 (Figure 4C–4F). These data
further confirm that PI3K/MEK/ERK-mediated Mcl-1
upregulation leads to Everolimus resistance in BRAF600E
cells, which can be pharmacologically reverted.

cells
The above findings demonstrate that BRAF600E
mediates ERK activation and Mcl-1 stabilization
downstream of PI3K, and predict that targeting any node in
this pathway sensitizes colon cancer cells to Everolimusinduced apoptosis. The Mcl-1 inhibitor TW-37 [29] alone
induced low levels of apoptosis in BRAF600E RKO
and VACO432 cells, and was additive or synergic with
Everolimus in apoptosis induction (Figure 4A and 4B).

a significant reduction in activated caspase-3 and TUNEL
staining in 600E tumors with elevated p-ERK (Figures 5C,
5D and S4A). Treatment-induced elevation in p-ERK and
Mcl-1 was confirmed in tumor lysates by western blotting
(Figure 5E). Consistent with cell culture data, inhibition
of p-S6K1 and p-4E-BP1 and induction of ER stress were
similar in WT and 600E tumors (Figures 5E, S4B and S4C).
These data establish that BRAF600E impairs Everolimusinduced apoptosis in vivo via the p-ERK/ Mcl-1 axis.

To determine a potential role of BRAF600E in acquired
resistance to mTOR inhibitors, we established Everolimusresistant (RR) cultures using three BRAF WT cell lines
(RKO BRAF+/−, VACO +/−, and Lim1215 +/+) through
repeated exposure to increasing doses of Everolimus. The
resulted cultures were referred as RKO-RR, VACO432-RR

and Lim1215-RR. Compared to parental (P) cell lines,
RR cultures were highly resistant to Everolimus-induced
apoptosis (Figure 6A), and showed strong elevation of Mcl-1
with fully inhibited p-S6K1, while p-ERK elevation was
only observed in RKO-RR culture (Figure 6B). Interestingly
BRAFV600E was only detected in RKO-RR culture
(Figure 6C) that was cross-resistant to Torin-1 (Figure S5C).
We further explored the publicly available drug
sensitivity data in cell lines from the Genomics of Drug
Sensitivity in Cancer Project (Sanger Institute, http://www.
cancerrxgene.org), and found that APC or RAS mutation
is an independently predictor of Temsirolimus resistance
in digestive cancer cells (Figure 6D), which induces

CHOP/DR5-dependent apoptosis in CRC cells similarly
as Everolimus as we have shown [19]. Taken together, our
data strongly suggest that Mcl-1 upregulation is likely a
key resistance mechanism to Everolimus in BRAF600E
cells (Figure 6E), while other CRC drivers including
the gatekeeper APC mutation might strongly influence
Everolimus sensitivity.

Discussion
Aberrant activation of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and

cancer such as increased cell proliferation, cell motility,

angiogenesis, and resistance to apoptosis [30]. Complex
compensatory mechanisms between these two pathways
and cancer driver mutations strongly influence therapeutic
responses of targeted agents [31, 32]. The antitumor
activities of rapalogs include inhibition of tumor cell growth,
metabolism and angiogenesis [1, 2] as well as induction of
apoptosis [19]. In the current study, we identified Mcl-1
upregulation and BRAF600E as resistance mechanisms of
mTOR inhibitors in colon cancer cells and in xenografts.
BRAF600E-dependent activation of MEK/ERK signaling
upon the disruption of S6K1-IRS2/PI3K negative feedback
stabilizes Mcl-1 to inhibit Bid-mediated crosstalk from the
death receptors to mitochondria and apoptosis.
A major challenge in the clinical use of mTOR
inhibitors and most targeted therapies is the lack of
biomarkers for patient stratification and response
monitoring [1, 3]. Resistance mechanisms to rapalogs are
complex [2, 6], ranging from compensatory activation
of mTORC2/PI3K/AKT [7, 8], ERK/MAPK [27], upregulation of the PIM family of oncogenic kinases
[33], oxidative stress [34], incomplete inhibition of
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 [35], and mTOR mutations
reducing drug-binding [4]. However, most of these
changes are biochemical in nature, and impractical to
assess prior to or during treatment. Our work demonstrates
BRAF600E as a cause of mTOR inhibitor resistance. This
finding is significant as DNA-based test coupled with
liquid biopsy might provide highly sensitive and specific
assays to follow therapeutic responses, where repeated
biopsy of solid tumors is impractical or complicated by
tumor heterogeneity 36].
Our findings suggest several strategies for
overcoming resistance to mTOR inhibitors, and support
that Mcl-1 inhibitors or BH3 mimetics [37], PI3K or
BRAF inhibitors [38] likely provide a strong synergy
to kill Mcl-1 addicted cells or those with KRAS/BRAF
mutations. Everolimus treatment also induced the
expression of several BH3-only proteins such as PUMA,
Bim, which likely potentiates apoptosis and Bid-mediated
crosstalk to the mitochondria, further supporting the use
of BH3 mimetics. However, strong activation of DISC
and caspase-8 kills BRAF600E cells bypassing Mcl-1
and the mitochondrial pathway, which is achieved by
transient exposure to high concentrations of rapalogs or
its combination with 5-FU or TRAIL as shown [19].
Using resistant models developed by in vitro
selection, we showed that Mcl-1 upregulation is likely
a key resistance mechanism to Everolimus and ATPcompetitive mTOR inhibitor Torin-1, while both
BRAF600E-dependent and-independent mechanisms
might be involved. The BRAF600E in RKO-RR culture
might rise de novo or through the expansion of rare cells
in the parental BRAF WT culture. It is possible that we
missed BRAF mutations outside of Exon 15 in the other
two cultures, but alternative mechanisms are more likely
as elevated p-ERK was not observed. Mcl-1 protein

turnover is highly regulated [24]. Alterations in E3 ligase
FBW7 [25], deubiquitinase USP9X [26], or upstream
regulators such as c-Met, EGFR or KRAS [22, 35] might
contribute to Mcl-l upregulation [9]. Though the response
of mutant KRAS CRC cells is likely to be more contextdependent [39].
Rapalogs induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor
models in vivo, however most solid tumors including CRC
cells are resistant to apoptosis induction or loss of p-4EBP1 in culture [1–3]. High levels of growth factors or
nutrients might lead to “cell culture” resistance, while APC
or RAS/RAF mutation can lead to intrinsic resistance. These
mechanisms likely work in concert to prevent activation of
destructive ER stress and CHOP/DR5-dependent apoptosis
[19]. Complex interactions of oncogenic pathways are
clearly influenced by the tissue type, driver mutation
and choice of agent [31]. The use of isogenic cell lines
and a collection of well characterized cell line models
are therefore invaluable in helping model drug actions in
preclinical models and guide future clinical testing [20].
In summary, our work identifies EKR-mediated
Mcl-1 stabilization via feedback activation of S6K1IRS-2/PI3K as a novel resistance mechanism to mTOR
inhibitors in BRAF600E colon cancer cells. Our findings
suggest that BRAF600E and some KRAS mutant colon
cancers are unlikely to respond to mono therapy targeting
mTOR, but might benefit from combination therapy
with BH3 mimetics, or inhibitors of PI3K, Raf or MEK.
Further study of these combinations in mouse models or
patient-derived xenograft models is warranted.

(Cambridge, MA, USA). Everolimus-resistant cell lines
were generated by treating parental BRAF WT cells with
increased concentrations of Everolimus from 15 µM to the
final 30 µM over a 5-month period with 2 days treatment
followed by 5 days of recovery. Exon 15 of BRAF was
amplified from cDNA and sequenced. Mycoplasma testing
was performed routinely by PCR. Cell lines were last
tested for the absence of Mycoplasma, genotype, drug
response and morphology in August 2015. We examined

mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were housed
in a sterile environment with micro isolator cages and
allowed access to water and chow ad libitum. Mice were
injected subcutaneously in both flanks with 4 × 106 WT
or BRAF600E RKO cells. After implantation, tumors
were allowed to grow to 50 mm3, approximately 7 days
BRAF 600E 13 days for BRAF WT before treatment
was initiated. Mice were randomized into two groups
to receive either vehicle or Everolimus (7.5 mg/kg/day)
in saline for ten days by oral gavage. Detailed methods
on tumor measurements and analysis are found in the
Supplementary Materials as described [43, 46]

loss of expression of targeted proteins by western blotting
routinely; no additional authentication was done by the
authors. Details on cell culture and primers are found in
the supplementary materials.

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Western blotting was performed as previously
described [40]. For immunoprecipitation, following cell
harvest from T-75 flasks, 5 mg of protein reconstituted in
1 ml RIPA buffer and 5 µg of antibody was used for each
experiment with Invitrogen Protein A and G Dynabead®
immunoprecipitation system according to manufacturer’s
instructions as previously described [41]. Resulting
immunocomplex was analyzed by western blotting. Details
on antibodies are found in the supplementary materials.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad
Prism IV software. P values were calculated by the
student’s t-test and were considered significant if p < 0.05.
The means ± one standard deviation (s.d.) are displayed
in the figures.

Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells using the Mini
RNA Isolation II Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One μg of total
RNA was used to generate cDNA using Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Real-time PCR was carried out as described [19, 42]
Details on primers are found in the supplementary
materials (Table S2).

Analysis of cell viability, apoptosis and cell death

Acknowledgments

Cell growth was measured by MTS, and apoptosis
was analyzed by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258
(Invitrogen), and Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)
(Invitrogen) followed by flow cytometry as described
[43, 44]. For crystal violet assays, the same number of cells
were treated for 48 hours in 12-well plates, and attached
cells were stained with crystal violet (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) [40]. Details are found in the supplementary materials.

Conflicts of Interest

Transfection and plasmids

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

The human V5-Mcl-1 expression construct has been
previously described [45], and HA-S6K1, HA-S6K1-E389
delta CT [28] expression constructs were obtained from
Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). Transfection was
performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Mcl-1, Bid, Bim, PUMA,
BRAF and IRS-2 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes
were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA).
Details for transfection, drug selection and siRNA sequence
are found in the supplementary materials (Table S3).
