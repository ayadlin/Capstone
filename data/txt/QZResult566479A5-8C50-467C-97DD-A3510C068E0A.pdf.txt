BACKGROUND: Men with high-risk prostate cancer are often thought to have very poor outcomes in terms of disease control and
survival even after definitive treatment. However, results after external beam radiotherapy have improved significantly through dose
escalation and the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This report describes long-term findings after low-dose (< 75.6 Gy) or
high-dose ( 75.6 Gy) external beam radiation, with or without ADT. METHODS: This analysis included 741 men with high-risk prostate
cancer (clinical classification  T3, Gleason score  8, or prostate-specific antigen level  20 ng/mL) treated with external beam radiotherapy at a single tertiary institution from 1987 through 2004. The radiation dose ranged from 60 to 79.3 Gy (median, 70 Gy); 295
men had received ADT for  2 years, and the median follow-up time was 8.3 years. RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year actuarial overall survival rates were significantly better for men treated with the higher radiation dose (no ADT plus  75.6 Gy, 87.3% and 72.0%, respectively; and ADT plus  75.6 Gy, 92.3% and 72%, respectively) (P 5.0035). The corresponding 5- and 10-year biochemical failure-free
survival rates were significantly better for patients treated with both ADT and higher radiation dose (82% and 77%, P <.0001). At 5
years, men who had not received ADT and had received radiation dose < 75.6 Gy had higher clinical local failure rates than those
given ADT and radiation dose  75.6 Gy (24.2% versus 0%, P <.0001). The 10-year symptomatic local failure rate was only 2% for all
patients. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to lingering historical perceptions, treatment of high-risk prostate cancer with modern, high-dose,
external beam radiotherapy and ADT can produce better biochemical, clinical, and survival outcomes over those from previous eras.
Specifically, symptomatic local failure is uncommon, and few men die of prostate cancer even 10 or more years after treatment.

INTRODUCTION
The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2011, approximately 240,890 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed
and 33,720 men will die of the disease.1 An estimated 13% to 21% of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases are localized and
considered at high risk of local and distant relapse after primary intervention.2 The management strategy for high-risk prostate
cancer (defined in terms of tumor size, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level) has been complicated by the
perception that long-term outcome in such cases, especially biochemical disease-free survival, is poor. Historically, disease-free
survival rates after external beam radiotherapy alone had been disappointing for men with locally advanced prostate cancer.3
Therefore, in the 1980s, attempts were made to improve the long-term outcome for men with high-risk disease by using
androgen suppression therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, and later intensity-modulated radiotherapy, to escalate the radiation dose. The use of prolonged androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and higher radiation doses have both led to
improved outcomes,4–6 leading to the hypothesis that this combination would likely produce additive improvements.
In addition to local and distant control, another long-term endpoint of particular interest to men with high-risk
prostate cancer is the development of symptomatic recurrences that affect their quality of life. High-risk and locally
advanced prostate cancer historically have been perceived as conferring a high risk of local recurrence after radiotherapy,
with clinical symptoms manifesting as bladder outlet obstruction, pelvic pain, and hematuria. Investigators from our institution previously reported a rate of symptomatic local recurrence of only 8.3% at 5 years after radiation, even when
patients were treated without ADT and much lower radiation doses than those used currently.7

Original Article

We report here significant improvements in longterm outcomes after the treatment of high-risk prostate
cancer with prolonged ADT and higher radiotherapy
doses. Contrary to previous assumptions, we found that
very few men developed disabling local recurrences that
affected their quality of life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics

This retrospective analysis, which was approved by the
appropriate institutional review board, involved 741 men
diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer who received
external beam radiotherapy at a single tertiary institution
from 1987 through 2004. Disease was characterized as
high risk if the clinical classification was  T3, the Gleason score was  8, or the PSA level was  20 ng/mL. The
staging work-up was standard thoughout the period of
study and included computed tomography scans of the
abdomen/pelvis and bone scans to rule out metastatic
disease.
The median patient age at diagnosis was 68.2 years
(range, 47-87 years), the median PSA level before treatment was 15.6 ng/mL (range, 1-323 ng/mL), and the median radiation dose received was 70 Gy (range, 60-79.3
Gy). The median follow-up time for all patients was 8.3
years (range, 0.13-20 years). Median follow-up times for
treatment groups were as follows: for the 375 men treated
without ADT and with low-dose radiation (< 75.6 Gy),
10.4 years; for the 122 men treated with ADT and < 75.6
Gy, 9.6 years; for the 71 men treated without ADT and
with high-dose radiation ( 75.6 Gy), 10.7 years; and for
the 173 patients treated with ADT and  75.6 Gy, 5.5
years. Patient and treatment characteristics are listed in
Table 1.
Treatment Techniques

Of the 741 men in this study, 295 (40%) received ADT
for  2 years (range, 2.0-18 years). The ADT involved either medical castration with intramuscular leuprolide acetate injections, with or without bicalutamide, or bilateral
orchiectomy. ADT was started 2 to 3 months before the
initiation of radiotherapy and continued for a median of
2.9 years (range, 2-18 years) after completion of the radiotherapy. All ADT was administered for at least 2 years; no
patient received less than 2 years of this therapy.
The radiotherapy techniques used were the standard
of care at our institution at the time. During the early portion of the study period, treatment involved a conventional 4-field technique; subsequent techniques included
3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and later,

when computed tomography simulation and modern
techniques became available, 8 coplanar-field intensitymodulated radiotherapy. The clinical target volume
(CTV) included the prostate and seminal vesicles only,
and did not include regional pelvic nodes. The planning
target volume (PTV) included the CTV with an additional 7- to 10-mm margin superiorly, inferiorly, and laterally and a 5- to 7-mm margin posteriorly. The dose
range was 60 to 79.3 Gy (median, 70 Gy) prescribed to
the isocenter in earlier years and more recently to
the PTV; all radiation was delivered as 1.8- to 2-Gy
fractions.
Statistical Analysis

Biochemical failure was defined as PSA levels exceeding
2 ng/mL over the nadir level,8 and local failure was
defined as clinically palpable disease or biopsy-proven
recurrence. Clinical failure included local, nodal, or distant failure or combinations thereof. Prostate cancer–
specific disease-free survival was defined as survival
without evidence of prostate cancer. Death from prostate
cancer was considered an event, and patients were censored at the time of last follow-up or death from another
cause. All endpoints were measured from the day of completion of the radiotherapy. Outcomes were analyzed

according to use of ADT (or not) and radiation dose
delivered (low or high).
All statistical analyses were performed with Stata statistical software, release 9 (StataCorp, College Station,
Tex). The log-rank test was used to analyze differences
between treatment groups. A Cox proportional hazards
model was used for multivariate analysis.
RESULTS
At the time of this analysis, the institutional standard for
treating high-risk prostate cancer was 2 years of ADT
combined with external beam radiotherapy to a dose of
at least 75.6 Gy. Therefore, we assigned patients to 1 of
4 treatment groups for the analysis: 1) No ADT with
< 75.6 Gy (low dose); 2) No ADT with  75.6 Gy
(high dose); 3) ADT with < 75.6 Gy; and 4) ADT with
 75.6 Gy. Our goal was to evaluate whether the addition of ADT and dose escalation improved long-term
outcome. Results are summarized in Table 2 and
described briefly below.
Biochemical (PSA-Based) Disease-Free Survival

The biochemical disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10
years after radiation were significantly different according
to the use of ADT or not and higher-dose versus lowerdose radiation: both rates were highest for those given
both ADT and high-dose radiation (Fig. 1A). Five-year
rates ranged from a low of 45.9% (for those with no ADT

and low-dose radiation) to 82.0% (for those with ADT
and high-dose radiation), and 10-year rates ranged from
30.1% (no ADT and low-dose radiation) to 61.4% (no
ADT and high-dose radiation) (P < .0001).
Clinical Failures

Use of ADT and high-dose radiation resulted in
decreased clinical failure rates at 5 years (P < .0001)
(Fig. 1B). Analyzing the specific type of failure revealed
statistically significant associations for local failure
(P < .0001) but not for nodal failure (P 5 .632) or distant metastasis (P 5 .081) (Table 2).
Among those patients who experienced local failure, subsequent related symptoms affecting their quality
of life (urinary obstruction/retention, hydronephrosis,
acute renal failure) occurred in 6.2% of patients at 10
years. The common symptomatic local failures were
reported as bladder/urinary retention (2.7%), urinary
frequency/obstructive symptoms (2.3%), incontinence/
increased nocturia (0.4%), and hydronephrosis (0.8%) at
long-term follow-up. No patient treated with ADT and
high-dose radiation developed symptomatic local recurrence (Fig. 1C).

treatment only 5.5% of patients treated even without
ADT and high-dose radiation had died of prostate cancer. However, after 5 years, there was a trend toward a
statistical difference between the ADT and high-dose
group and the low-dose groups (Fig. 2A). Although outcome for men in the no ADT and high-dose group
seemed to be at least as good as that in the ADT and
high-dose group, the former group was small (71
patients) and had elected to forego ADT largely because
of favorable tumor characteristics.

Use of ADT and high radiation dose had a considerable positive effect on overall survival (OS) as well
(Fig. 2B) at 5 years after treatment. Specifically, use of
ADT with high-dose radiation produced OS rates of 92%
at 5 years, compared with 82% for the low-dose and no
ADT group, and the projected 10-year difference would
be 72% versus 57% (Table 2).
Cause of Mortality

The causes of death for men with high-risk prostate cancer
according to treatment group are summarized in Table 3.
Even without the use of ADT in combination with highdose radiation, there was a trend toward fewer prostate
cancer deaths compared with that in the other treatment
arms.
DISCUSSION
The role of ADT in conjunction with external beam
radiotherapy for locally advanced and high-risk prostate
cancer has been investigated in several randomized trials.
Trials performed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG 85-31 and 86-10) showed that long-term
ADT and radiotherapy improved local control and biochemical relapse–free survival compared with radiotherapy alone for patients with unfavorable-prognosis prostate
cancer.9,10 The ensuing RTOG 92-02 trial showed that
for a subset of patients with tumors of Gleason score 8 to
10, receiving ADT for 2 years after radiotherapy led to
improved OS compared with radiotherapy followed by 4
months of ADT.6,11 Other prospective randomized studies reported by Bolla et al12 and D’Amico et al13 showed
that ADT in combination with radiotherapy led to not
only improved local control and decreased prostate canCancer

cer–specific mortality but also improved OS. These studies built the foundation supporting the use of long-term
ADT and radiotherapy as standard therapy for locally
advanced and high-risk prostate cancer.
In our experience, men with high-risk prostate cancer who received at least 2 years of ADT had significantly
better 10-year rates of freedom from biochemical failure,
freedom from clinical failure, and OS than did men who
received no ADT, similar to the results of these previously
reported randomized trials. We observed a trend toward
but not a significant difference in prostate cancer–specific
survival between the treatment arms. Few patients died of
prostate cancer at 5 years and 10 years after radiation; the
number of prostate cancer deaths were too few to likely
power a statistical difference between treatment arms.
Our series included a relatively small subset of patients
who were not given ADT because of small disease volumes, lower PSA levels, or lower Gleason scores but were
nonetheless treated with higher radiation doses. The 10year OS and clinical failure rates for these patients were
similar to those for men given ADT with radiation doses
> 75.6 Gy, and this similarity probably reflected the
favorable risk characteristics rather than the lack of ADT.
Because these patients generally had less bulky disease,
lower Gleason scores, and lower pretreatment PSA levels,
they probably would have had a more favorable outcome;
hence, these outcomes cannot be used as evidence to support omitting ADT for the average high-risk patient,
although it does speak to the benefit of dose escalation
when groups who did not receive ADT are compared.
Several randomized trials have demonstrated better
PSA relapse–free survival for patients treated with higher
radiation doses compared with those treated with lower
doses. In one such study, rates of freedom from distant
metastasis and freedom from failure were both better for
men treated with 78 Gy rather than 70 Gy, with the largest benefit seen for patients with PSA levels > 10 ng/mL.4
In that study, at 8 years of follow-up, the use of the higher
radiation dose led to superior freedom from biochemical
failure rates (78% for the 78-Gy group versus 59% for the
70-Gy group, P 5 .004). Moreover, rates of clinical failure were significantly reduced from 15% in the 70-Gy
group to 7% in the 78-Gy group (P 5 .014).5 In a more
recent follow-up report, significant differences in prostate
cancer–specific survival were also seen for patients with
PSA > 10 ng/mL or high-risk disease treated at the higher
dose level.14 In a nonrandomized study, Zelefsky et al15,16
also reported improvement in PSA relapse–free survival
with the use of doses of at least 75.6 Gy; at 8 years, the
PSA relapse–free survival rate among unfavorable-risk
3269

Original Article

groups was 72% after delivery of 81 Gy. Hence, several
trials of dose escalation have shown reductions in the
risk of biochemical failure, but none of these trials has
demonstrated improvement in OS or disease-specific
mortality.4,14–17
Evidence from other randomized trials shows clearly
that radiotherapy in combination with ADT yields significantly improved clinical outcomes. This realization led to
the hypothesis that use of both high-dose radiotherapy
and ADT would produce maximum improvement in outcome for men with high-risk prostate cancer. Zapatero
et al18 reported that freedom from biochemical failure
rates at 5 years after treatment were 84% for high-risk
patients treated with ADT and > 72 Gy versus 63% for
those treated with ADT and < 72 Gy (P 5 .003). In this
study, we found statistically significant benefits in OS,
PSA disease-free survival, freedom from clinical failure,
and fewer local failures when men with high-risk prostate
cancer who were treated with ADT in combination with
high-dose radiotherapy. The shorter median follow-up
time for this group (5.5 years) reflects the relatively recent
institutional practice of dose escalation for patients with
localized prostate cancer. This follow-up time was shorter
in the patients receiving ADT and high-dose radiation
therapy. Due to the inherent limitations in our comparison to the other 3 treatment groups, we only reported our
5-year outcome for this group. Our standard practice for
patients with high-risk prostate cancer is delivering ADT
in combination with high-dose radiotherapy; our intention is to report our long-term outcome in this group
when longer follow-up is available.
Our institutional practice does not include elective
irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes; rather, the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer has consisted of 2 years
of ADT in combination with external beam radiation
therapy delivered to only the prostate and seminal vesicles.
Indeed, the clinical failure–free survival rate without pelvic nodal irradiation at 10 years of follow-up was 81.9%
(Table 2). Moreover, no patients who received high-dose
radiation and ADT experienced local failure versus 12.9%
of those treated with higher doses but without ADT and
32.8% of those without ADT and lower radiotherapy
doses. Our local failure rate of 6.8% for patients treated
with ADT but with lower radiation doses was similar to
reported local failure rates for patients treated in a
randomized trial reported by Bolla et al.12,19 An update of
their 10-year results showed a local failure rate of 4% for
patients treated with long-term ADT and radiation dose
of 70 Gy, indicating that long-term ADT reduced local
failures even when lower radiation doses were given.
3270

Contrary to prior belief that men with high-risk
prostate cancer experience symptomatic local recurrences,
we found a low 3.7% rate of symptomatic local recurrence
even at 10 years among the entire cohort of patients, and
no local symptomatic recurrences when patients were
treated with modern radiation techniques with high radiation doses and androgen suppression therapy. At 10 years,
only 2.7% of the patients experienced urinary/bladder
obstructive symptoms, 0.5% of patients had hydronephrosis, 0.4% of patients had urinary frequency/urge incontinence, and 0.1% of patients reported hematuria. Thus,
in the modern era, treatment consisting of 2 years of ADT
in combination with high-dose radiotherapy can produce
excellent outcomes at long-term follow-up, and the fear of
high rates of symptomatic local recurrence is unfounded.
Conclusions

Our analyses indicate that long-term ADT in combination with high-dose external beam radiation therapy produces outcome results far superior to that of lingering
historical perceptions. Our experience demonstrated that
use of long-term ( 2 years) ADT in combination with
radiation doses in excess of 75.6 Gy produced significant
improvements in biochemical, clinical, and survival outcomes compared with previous eras; specifically, local failure rates were low and associated symptoms were
uncommon. Information such as this is critical for counseling patients on treatment options.
