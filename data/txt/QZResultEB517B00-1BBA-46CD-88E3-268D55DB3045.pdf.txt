Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) harbors an exceedingly poor prognosis,
and is generally considered a therapy-recalcitrant disease due to poor response to
conventional chemotherapy coupled with non-actionable genetic drivers (e.g. KRAS
mutations). However, PDA frequently loses p16ink4a, thereby leading to deregulation
of CDK4/6. Surprisingly, in established cell models and xenografts, CDK4/6 inhibition
has a modest effect on proliferation and resistance develops rapidly. To determine
if such weak response was an intrinsic feature of PDA, we developed primary
tumor explants that maintain the tumor environment and recapitulate feuture of
primary PDA. The CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 was highly efficient at suppressing
proliferation in 14 of the 15 explants. In the single resistant explant, we identified
the rare loss of the RB tumor suppressor as the basis for resistance. Patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs) were developed in parallel, and unlike the xenografts emerging
from established cell lines, the PDXs maintained the histoarchitecture of the primary
tumor. These PDXs were highly sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition, yielding a complete
suppression of PDA proliferation. Together, these data indicate that primary PDA
is sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition, that specific biomarkers can delineate intrinsic
resistance, and that established cell line models may not represent an adequate
means for evaluating therapeutic sensitivities.

INTRODUCTION

progress [5, 6]. The only approved targeted therapy,
erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine, has added
approximately 4 weeks to patient’s overall survival, while
other targeted agents including MEK, PI3K and mTOR
inhibitors, have failed to demonstrate any efficacy in
clinical studies [6-8]. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet
need to develop rational, targeted approaches for the
treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Genetic analysis of PDA has defined multiple
oncogenic events that drive the initiation and progression
of disease [9, 10]. Approximately 90% of pancreatic

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a poor
prognosis, with 5-year overall survival of approximately
6% [1-4]. PDA is often diagnosed at a late stage, at which
point a curative resection is no longer possible and the
approved systemic therapies have a relatively modest
impact on survival. Despite recent introduction of more
effective chemotherapy regimens including FOLFIRINOX
and combination of gemcitabine with Nab-paclitaxel,

cancers are driven by KRAS, while the loss of the TP53
and SMAD4 tumor suppressors occurs in a large fraction
of tumors. Unfortunately, these genetic events remain
largely non-actionable due to the lack of drugs that
selectively target these oncogenic events. An additional
signature genetic/epigenetic event in PDA is the loss or
silencing of the tumor suppressor CDKN2A [11]. Based
on genetic analysis, mutation or homozygous deletion
of CDKN2A occurs in ~50% of tumors, and epigenetic
silencing is also frequently observed. Thus, the vast
majority of PDA cases have functional loss of this tumor
suppressor [8, 12].
The CDKN2A gene encodes the p16ink4a protein,
which is a potent physiological inhibitor of CDK4/6
[13]. During cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 is activated
downstream of multiple signaling cascades, and is required
to initiate the phosphorylation of RB and subsequent
entry into S-phase [14, 15]. The levels of p16ink4a are
stimulated during specific stresses, leading to a blockade
of proliferation and inducing features of senescence [13].
In particular, p16ink4a serves as a critical mediator of
oncogene-induced senescence driven by KRAS mutation;
therefore, there is strong selective pressure for its loss in
PDA [16, 17]. Consequently, it is believed that the loss of
p16ink4a is a key hallmark of RAS driven tumors and is
frequently observed in a host of tumors with deregulation
of the KRAS/RAF oncogenic singnaling pathway
including non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and
colorectal cancer, in addition to PDA [18-20].
Since p16ink4a functions as an inhibitor of CDK4/6,
it would be anticipated that this cell cycle regulated
kinase family would be an important and actionable target
in PDA. Over the last several years, drugs specifically
targeting CDK4/6 have been developed [21, 22]. Presently,
three highly-specific agents are now amenable to clinical
use (PD-0332991, LEE-011, and LY2835219). These
agents induce cell cycle arrest and delay progression/
proliferation in tumor models [23-25]. This has been
observed across a host of models and disease indications,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

including leukemias, breast cancer, and pediatric tumor
types [21]. Surprisingly, in work published by several
groups, single agent CDK4/6 inhibition had a particularly
weak effect in models of pancreatic cancer [26-28]. Given
the genetics of the disease, we sought to use patientderived models to better delineate the significance of
CDK4/6 inhibition in the treatment of PDA.

RESULTS
Established models of PDA have a relatively weak
response to CDK4/6 inhibition
In order to evaluate the response to CDK4/6
inhibition, several well-established PDA cell lines were
employed. Treatment with 1 µM PD-0332991 resulted
in a modest suppression of proliferation, as measured
by 5-bromo-2deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, in
established pancreatic cancer cell lines at 24 hours of
treatment (Figure 1A). In these same cell lines, crystal
violet staining after 7 days of treatment demonstrated
variable inhibition of tumor cell growth amongst the
PDA established lines, with the PANC1 line appearing
relatively sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition and the MIAPACA2 line appearing relatively resistant (Figure 1B).
Interestingly, BrdU incorporation in cell lines treated
with PD-0332991 over a span of 2 weeks demonstrated
proliferation in the presence of the agent, suggesting
a durable response is not achieved in these models and
there is rapid progression to a resistance (Figure 1C).
To determine if this phenotype was selective to cells in
culture, PL-45 and PL-5 xenografts were developed. The
mice were treated with PD-0332991 via oral gavage. The
treatment with PD-0332991 did elicit suppression of tumor
growth in PL-5 xenografts, with tumor volume in the
treatment group significantly lower than that of controls
(p < 0.0001). However, the suppression of residual

tumor proliferation was relatively limited and even in the
presence of daily dosing, a proliferative index of 79.6%
in PL-5 xenografts and 40.6% in PL-45 xenografts was
observed (Figure 1D). Together, these data in established
models is consistent with recently published studies that
suggests that monotherapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors may
not be particularly effective in PDA [26-28].

Strong membranous EGFR expression (score 3+), which
stimulates downstream MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling
cascades to influence cell proliferation and metastasis
[33], was seen in 5 of 15 (33.3%) of primary tumors and
explants cultures. These findings demonstrate that ex
vivo explants maintain the overall biomarker phenotype
of the tumor. Given the theoretical possibility of high
intra-explant variability, we evaluated six explant cases
from duplicate and triplicate culture wells at 48 hours. As
shown in Supplemental Figure 2B, there was significant
concordance between multiple explants from a given
case. To determine if the explant cultures retained the
same proliferative nature of the primary tumor, Ki67
was evaluated in parallel. Among primary tumors, a
range from 21 to 89.5% of Ki67 positive tumor cells
was observed (Figure 2C). There was a strong positive
correlation in Ki67 index between the original tumor and
the corresponding explanted tissue in all cases (R2 = 0.97,
p < 0.001). These data indicate that the ex vivo explants
retained the proliferative potential similar to that of the
primary tumor.

Explants cultures recapitulate the diversity of
PDA
Many established cell lines have experienced
selection for growth in culture, which is known to
selectively perturb cell cycle regulatory mechanisms
[29]. Furthermore, the desmoplastic architecture of PDA
contributed by neighboring stromal cells is known to be
particularly important for its biology [30, 31]. Therefore,
we sought to develop a primary tumor explant model as a
means to accurately recapitulate key features of PDA. The
protocol used here was based on prior work with breast
cancer specimens [32]. Fresh surgical tissue, not required
for diagnosis, was dissected into approximately ~1 mm3
sections. These were cultured on a semi-solid support from
0-192 hours, during which time drugs could be applied.
Explant cultures where then removed, fixed, and stained
for relevant markers. After the establishment of this
methodology, 15 unselected, consecutive PDA specimens
were studied as explants (Figure 2A). The clinical and
histopathological data of the subjects are summarized
in Supplemental Figure 1. All explants retained tissue
architecture and degrees of cellularity comparable to
that observed in the tumor section obtained for clinical
pathologic evaluation (Figure 2B). Morphological and
architectural integrity of tissues was maintained in tumor
samples for up to 192 hours of culture (Supplemental
Figure 2A). The proliferative index was assessed by Ki67
immunostaining on day 1, 4, 6 and 8. The percentage
of proliferating cells was stable across all time points,
without a significant decrease up to 192 h (Supplemental
Figure 2A). The number of apoptotic cells, visualized
using cleaved caspase 3 staining also did not change
significantly over time (Supplemental Figure 2A). The
level of key molecular markers (p16ink4a, p53, EGFR)
in the pathogenesis of PDA were evaluated in both
primary tumor and explant, with representative staining
between the surgical specimen and the cultured explants
as shown (Figure 2B). P16ink4a loss or weak expression
was seen in 14 of 15 cases (93%); strong p16 expression
was seen in only one case (Case #5; Figure 2B). The
TP53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated
in PDA, with approximately 50% of these carcinomas
showing intragenic mutation. Strong nuclear labeling
for the p53 protein, which correlates with mutation
stabilizing p53 protein, was present in 67% of primary
tumors and corresponding explants cultures (Figure 2C).

CDK4/6 inhibition has potent activity in patient
explants
Preservation of tissue architecture, viability and
molecular phenotype suggested that treatment of explant
cultures with therapeutic agents could reveal sensitivities
that would be concordant with the primary tumor. In
PDA explants, treatment with PD-0332991 showed
profound suppression of Ki67 staining (Figure 3A and
3B). This effect was specific to the drug and was not
observed in tissues treated with DMSO (vehicle) for the
same period or with gemcitabine (Supplemental Figure
3A). Interestingly, there was some heterogeneity in the
response to PD-0332991. Specifically, 13 of the 15 cases
exhibited a greater than 5-fold suppression of Ki67 upon
exposure to PD-0332991, and post-treatment Ki67 index
below 7% (Figure 3B). In contrast, one case maintained a
Ki67 index of 16.5% post-treatment, in spite of a greater
than 5-fold reduction (case #7), and one case showed no
reduction in Ki67 staining (case #5). Of note, the response
to PD-0332991 did not depend on p53 status but was
specific to the tumor cells, since lymphocytes present
within the explants effectively responded as evidenced
by suppression of Ki67 (not shown). Thus, the failure to
respond to PD-0332991 appears to be a consequence of
tumor-specific genetic events, and not due to distinctions
in intrinsic drug sensitivity of a given individual. Since
preclinical data suggest that an intact RB pathway is
required for the cytostatic response to PD-0332991 [3437], we further investigated the activation status of the
RB pathway by immunohistochemical stains. Tumors
that are RB deficient expressed exceedingly high levels
of p16ink4a with high Ki67 proliferation index [13, 32].

Suppression of tumor growth in patient derived
xenografts

Both the primary tumors and explants were stained for
p16ink4a and RB. Within the cohort of evaluated cases,
only one case exhibited high levels of p16ink4a and low
RB (Case #5; Figure 3C). RB and p16ink4a expression
was conserved between the primary tumors and the
explants. These data indicate that the vast majority of PDA
is responsive to PD-0332991 and only the infrequent loss
of RB is associated with lack of response.

Though tumor explants provide a striking
recapitulation of the primary tumor, we sought to
complement this approach with patient-derived xenografts
to obtain in vivo data over a longer treatment period. In this
model, fragments of primary tumor are subcutaneously
implanted in NSG mice, allowing the tumors to grow and

of their ligands [41, 44, 45], and that there is a degree
of reciprocity involved in this communication, i.e.,
tumor stroma can influence tumor epithelial cells. The
mutual interaction between tumor cells and surrounding
environment appears particularly significant in PDA,
where stromal cell promote tumor development and
invasiveness but, in some cases, also limit rampant
tumor cell growth [30, 46-48]. Thus, it is of importance
to develop models that recapitulate these complex
interactions. We employed two models that allowed us to
study therapeutic efficacy from patient specimens: ex vivo
tissue explants cultures and patient-derived xenografts.
The histological features of both models are highly
distinct from the fairly uniform collection of cells seen in
xenografts established through injections of tumor lines
such as PL-45 and PL-5. However, each of these models
has intrinsic advantages/disadvantages. The explant model
provides a window into the intact tumor of the patient.
It fully retains human tumor-stroma interactions, which
allows for studying the activity of anticancer drugs and
small molecule inhibitors in the context of an individual
patient’s tumor biology-in some ways reproducing the
effect of performing serial biopsies to assess tissue
response to therapy. In spite of the desirable features of
the explant model, it does not recapitulate mechanisms
of drug delivery, metabolism, and in vivo physiology.
The PDX models employed accurately recapitulate the
histological features of the pancreatic cancer from which
they were derived and allow the study of tumor growth
and inhibition over time. In the era of personalized
medicine, these models could allow genetic alterations
in tumor cells to be targeted within the context of their
complex interactions with the stromal compartment.
Targeting cell cycle control is an attractive antitumor strategy, with the goal of preventing disease
progression. The vast majority of human tumors exhibit
some form of cell cycle deregulation, allowing tumors
to proliferate unabated. Multiple aberrations affect the
G1/S transition, including the amplification of D1 cyclin,
deletions and mutations of RB and/or downregulation of
CDK4/6 inhibitor p16ink4a [49, 50]. All these events lead
to loss of proliferative control, with p16ink4a inactivation
being exceedingly common in PDA [3, 13, 51]. Thus, it
was unexpected that multiple established pancreatic cancer
cell models would exhibit a relatively weak response to
pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibit. In contrast, all explants
that retained RB protein and showed low p16ink4A
staining exhibited decrease in Ki67 proliferation index
upon treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991.
While RB loss has not been previously reported in
pancreatic cancer cell models, the data here demonstrates
that in some PDA cases functional expression of RB is
lost. These data also indicate that the analyses of p16ink4a
and RB status can be used prospectively to evaluate the
response to CDK4/6 inhibitors in clinical specimens, and
suggests an approach for developing markers for targeted

subsequently passaged into other NSG mice for expansion
into treatment cohorts (Figure 4A). Unlike the PL-45 or
PL-5 xenografts that harbor little tissue architecture
reminiscent of PDA, the three patient-derived xenograft
exhibited histologic architecture remarkably similar
to their tumor of origin (Figure 4B). Treatment of the
cohort with PD-0332991 resulted in marked suppression
of tumor growth and in some cases a reduction in tumor
volume (Figure 4C). Analysis of the tissue treated with
PD-0332991 revealed complete suppression of Ki67
across all three PDX cohorts (Figure 4D). This profound
anti-proliferative effect on Ki67 was not seen in the PDX
cohort treated with gemcitabine similar to the observations
in explant culture (Supplemental Figure 3B). Each tumor
had a low baseline of apoptosis, as observed with cleaved
caspase 3, and PD-0332991 either had no effect or elicited
a slight increase in tumor cell turnover (Figure 4E).
Together, these data indicate that CDK4/6 suppression
is particularly effective in limiting the proliferation of
patient-derived models of resectable disease.

DISCUSSION
Treatment of PDA continues to present a significant
challenge and in spite of multiple preclinical studies there
has been only modest improvement in survival, with the
principle gains coming from cytotoxic chemotherapies [1].
The vast majority of preclinical studies supporting drug
development are carried out in established cell line models
grown in culture or as xenografts. While facilitating rapid
analysis, these models are not entirely representative of
PDA. Many of these models, as shown here, grow very
rapidly in cell culture and correspondingly produce
xenografts with higher Ki67 indices than those reported
in clinical PDA samples. The average Ki67 index in
primary PDA is ~30% and the tumor exhibits an organized
glandular architecture [38]. Additionally, the tumor is
dominated by desmoplastic stroma that has recently
emerged as a tumor suppressive feature of the disease
though it also inhibits drug uptake [30, 39-41]. Despite
the established models harboring genetic alterations that
would be expected to confer substantial sensitivity to
targeting CDK4/6, xenografts derived from established
cell lines rapidly progress. This may reflect decades of
selection for cell cycle deregulation in culture conditions.
As result, high proliferation index and possibly cell cycle
deregulation in these models can simply overwhelm
cytostatic/targeted therapies through mechanisms that may
not reflect primary tumor biology. While our study focused
on CDK4/6 inhibition, cell cycle responses influence the
activity of a range of targeted agents [42, 43], and this
observation could be relevant to many targeted drug
therapies.
It has become well accepted that tumors regulate
the development of surrounding stroma through the
induction of growth factor receptors and the production

tumor post chemotherapy and/or during progression to
metastatic disease. The work herein demonstrates that
our patient-derived models of PDA share remarkably
similar biology to their pancreatic tumor of origin, and
that in these models, CDK4/6 inhibition leads to potent
suppression of tumor growth. Despite limited efficacy
in established cell line models, this data suggests that
CDK4/6 inhibitors should be considered for inclusion into
emerging pancreatic cancer clinical trials.

therapies prior to clinical trials. Moreover, cytostatic
response to PD-0332991 was confirmed in PDX models,
lending further support to the possibility that CDK4/6
inhibitors may have potent activity in PDA.
A key question is whether the distinct response to
PD-0332991 between established and patient-derived
models reflects intrinsic PDA biology. While established
models were initially developed from PDA lesions,
some originated from metastatic disease, and most have
been serially cultured for long periods of time, wherein
mutations that enhance proliferation are progressively
selected. It remains unclear if changes acquired during

sterile scalpel and microdissection scissors, any apparent
fat tissue was removed from the surface of the specimen
and discarded. Samples were then cut into 1 mm3 pieces.
Upon complete hydration of gelatin sponges, each was
transferred to individual wells of a 12-well cell culture
dish, and 2.5 ml of complete explant media was added
to each well. One mm3 dissected specimen sections were
chosen at random and placed on top of each sponge using
sterile forceps. Tissues were placed near the edges of the
sponge to allow for media perfusion in between tissue
sections. Explant cultures were incubated at 37oC and 5%
CO2.
Each treatment condition was examined with three
pieces of tissue per sponge. Fifteen independent PDA
cases were evaluated. Only 12 explant cultures were
evaluated for response to gemcitabine due to limited
tissue. Following plating, explants were allowed to recover
in explant media for 24 hours. Explants were then treated
for 48 hours with vehicle control (DMSO), a selective
CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (1 μM), or gemcitabine
(20 nM). Explants were removed from culture, fixed and
processed for immunohistochemical analyses.

Cell culture, derivation and treatment
The established cell lines PL-45, MIA-PACA2,
PL-5, PANC1, and CAPAN2 were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, as previously published
[28]. Cells were treated with 1 µM CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991, with drug replenished every 72 hours. Acute and
durable responses to PD-0332991, measured at 24 hours
and 2 weeks respectively, were assessed by 5-bromo-2deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and measured by flow
cytometry. Following conclusion of treatment, PDA cell
models were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol (in PBS) for
2 hours at 4ºC. Fixed cells were incubated with 2 M HCl
and 0.3 mg/ml pepsin for 30 minutes at room temperature
and neutralized with 0.1 M sodium borate (pH 8.5) for
2 minutes. Following neutralization, cells were washed
with IFA buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 25 mM NaCl,
4% fetal calf serum) and then incubated in IFA containing
0.5% Tween for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were
pelleted and re-suspended in FITC-anti-BrdU diluted in
IFA buffer (1:10) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 1
hour at room temperature. After antibody incubation, cells
were washed once in IFA and incubated for 10 min on
ice in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 20 μg/ml PI and 40 μg/
ml RNase. Cells were then analyzed by FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences) instrument to determine PI (red) and
FITC (green) staining for nuclear DNA and BrdU content,
respectively.

Histology and immunohistochemical stains
The original tumor tissue and the explant of the
tumor tissue were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
and embedded in paraffin. Four microm sections were
stained with H&E for the histological evaluation. For
immunohistochemical analysis four micron paraffin
sections were prepared, deparaffinized in xylene, and
rehydrated with graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was
performed by microwave pretreatment. The following
antibodies were employed for the analysis: Ki67 (clone
30-9, dilution, Ventana Medical Systems), p53 (clone DO7, dilution 1:100, DAKO), p16ink4a (clone E6H4, dilution
1:50, MTM Laboratories), RB (clone 1F8, dilution 1:50,
Thermoscientific), EGFR (clone 5B7 prediluted, Ventana
Medical Systems) and cleaved caspase 3 (clone 5A1E,
dilution 1:300, Cell Signaling). All stains were performed
using the BenchMark XT Slide Preparation System
(Ventana Medical Systems).

Tissue preparation and explant cultures
PDA tumor tissue from resected surgical specimens,
which was not needed for diagnostic purposes, was used.
The collection of tissue was approved by the institutional
review board (IRB). Tissues collected for explants
culture were placed into 10 mL of complete explant
culture medium for transport to the laboratory. Explant
culture media consisted of RPMI 1640 base (Sigma)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Antibiotic/
antimycotic solution was added to a final concentration of
1 X (Sigma). Hydrocortisone (Sigma) was re-suspended
in 95% EtOH and supplemented at a concentration of
1mg/100ml media. Lastly, recombinant human insulin
was added at a final concentration of 1mg/100ml media
(Gibco). Tissues were maintained in this medium at 4ºC
until processing. All source tissues were plated as explants
within 12 hours. Under sterile conditions and one hour
prior to tissue dissection, 1 cm3 hemostatic gelatin dental
sponges (Vetspon, Novartis) were hydrated in explant
culture media at 37ºC. While the sponges were hydrating,
tissues were transferred to a 10 cm cell culture dish with
10 ml complete explant media for dissection. Using a

Automated image analyses and scoring
Immunohistochemically stained primary tumor
and explant slides were scanned using an Aperio
ScanScope®CS instrument at 20X, (Aperio Technologies,
Vista, CA, USA). Stains were quantified using analysis
tools developed by Aperio. Nuclear algorithms were
used to evaluate Ki67, p53 and RB stain; membranous
and cytoplasmic algorithms were applied for EGFR and
p16ink4a quantification, respectively. The mean staining
intensity and percentage of staining cells were recorded
for Ki67, p53, RB and p16ink4a stains. Immunolabeling

for p53 was interpreted as positive and predictive of
TP53 mutations if >75% tumors cell showed strong
positive staining. RB expression was scored as negative
(cancer cells showed no staining while normal cells were
positive), weak (mean staining intensity was less than
adjacent normal cells), or strong (staining intensity was
equal to adjacent normal cells). RB loss was defined as
a score of either negative, or weak. For p16ink4a the
staining was graded as 0 (no cells staining), 1+ (diffuse
weak cytoplasmic expression or < 25% cell showing
strong staining), 2+ (25% to 75% of cells with strong
staining), and 3+ (> 75% cells showing strong staining). A
3+ score was considered high expression. For EGFR the
score (range 0-3) was reported.

Approximately 3.0x106 PL-45 and PL-5 cell lines
were mixed with Matrigel® basement membrane matrix
(Corning Life Sciences, Bedford, MA). Cells were
injected subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD-SCID
IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice. Tumor progression was
measured by calipers twice weekly and tumor volume was
approximated using the formula: (length x (width2))/2.

Xenograft treatment
Treatment with PD-0332991 was performed on
cohorts of at least 8 mice with tumors measuring between
150 and 500 mm3. The mice were randomized to treatment
or control arms. The treated mice received palbociclib
via oral gavage at a dose of 125 mg/kg in pH 4 lactate
buffer (50 mM) daily. Gemcitabine was administered
by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 50 µg/kg in
phosphate buffered saline. The control mice received
lactate buffer via oral gavage once daily. Tumor sizes were
assessed daily using calipers to determine tumor volume
as described above. Treatment lasted for 5-8 days, after
which the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were fixed
in 10% formalin for histologic and immunohistological
analysis.

Patient-derived xenografts
NOD-SCID IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice were
maintained in a barrier facility under HEPA-filtered air
with food and water available as desired. Food, water
and cage bedding were sterilized prior to use. Mice were
manipulated under sterile conditions during surgery.
Animal experiments fulfilled National Institutes of
Health and UT Southwestern requirements for humane
animal care and were approved by the UT Southwestern
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tumor tissue acquisition was performed under an
Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol approved at
UT Southwestern Medical Center. Fresh tumor tissue was
stored in sterile specimen cups and transported in RPMI1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) on ice. The tumor
specimens were dissected in 3 mm x 3 mm fragments and
coated in Matrigel® basement membrane matrix (Corning
Life Sciences, Bedford, MA). NSG mice were anesthetized
with isoflurane and, once sedated, their flank was shaved
and cleansed with 70% alcohol and betadine. A 1 cm
incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous
tissue. A tumor fragment was then implanted into the flank
and the incision was closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture. Mice
were monitored daily for 2 consecutive days after surgery
with particular attention paid to animal distress, wound
dehiscence and signs of infections. Thereafter, they were
examined 2-3 times per week. Tumor size was assessed by
measurement with calipers once a week. Tumor volume
was approximated using measurements of tumor length
and width with the formula: (length x (width2))/2. The
mice were sacrificed and tumors were harvested once
they reached a diameter greater than 1.5 cm. The tissue
was frozen in liquid N2 as well as kept fresh in RPMI for
passaging into a larger cohort of mice. All three patientderived xenografts were successfully passaged twice in
order to develop a cohort large enough for treatment.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc). Student’s
t-test and Pearson correlation analyses were used and
results with p < 0.05 were considered significant.
