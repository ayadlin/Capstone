Abstract
Persistent androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity underlies resistance to AR-targeted therapy and
progression to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recent success in retargeting persistent AR
activity with next generation androgen/AR axis inhibitors such as enzalutamide (MDV3100) has validated AR as a
master regulator during all stages of disease progression. However, resistance to next generation AR inhibitors
limits therapeutic efﬁcacy for many patients. One emerging mechanism of CRPC progression is AR gene
rearrangement, promoting synthesis of constitutively active truncated AR splice variants (AR-V) that lack the AR
ligand-binding domain. In this study, we show that cells with AR gene rearrangements expressing both full-length
and AR-Vs are androgen independent and enzalutamide resistant. However, selective knock-down of AR-V
expression inhibited androgen-independent growth and restored responsiveness to androgens and antiandrogens. In heterogeneous cell populations, AR gene rearrangements marked individual AR-V–dependent cells that
were resistant to enzalutamide. Gene expression proﬁling following knock-down of full-length AR or AR-Vs
showed that AR-Vs drive resistance to AR-targeted therapy by functioning as constitutive and independent
effectors of the androgen/AR transcriptional program. Further, mitotic genes deemed previously to be unique ARV targets were found to be biphasic targets associated with a proliferative level of signaling output from either ARVs or androgen-stimulated AR. Overall, these studies highlight AR-Vs as key mediators of persistent AR signaling
and resistance to the current arsenal of conventional and next generation AR-directed therapies, advancing the
concept of AR-Vs as therapeutic targets in advanced disease. Cancer Res; 73(2); 483–9. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Androgen depletion therapy (ADT) achieves clinical regression or disease stabilization for men with advanced prostate
cancer (PCa). However, castration-resistant or -recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC) invariably develops due to aberrant reactivation of the androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis
(1). This has been conﬁrmed clinically through the recent
retargeting of persistent androgen/AR activity in CRPC
patients with next generation AR-axis inhibitors such as the
potent antiandrogen enzalutamide (2, 3). Despite an increase
in overall survival, de novo resistance to enzalutamide pre-

cludes responses for many patients, and resistance can develop
rapidly in initial responders (4). However, mechanisms that
could mediate resistance to enzalutamide are poorly
understood.
Altered AR mRNA splicing and synthesis of COOH-terminally truncated AR variant (AR-V) proteins lacking the AR
ligand-binding domain (LBD) is one mechanism that has
been postulated to drive an overall resistance to conventional
and next generation ADT (5). Indeed, the transcriptionally
active NH2-terminal domain (NTD) and central DNA binding
domain are sufﬁcient for AR-Vs to function as ligand-independent transcription factors (6). Moreover, AR-Vs are frequently expressed in CRPC metastases (7, 8), and high mRNA
and/or protein expression levels in PCa tissues predict disease progression and shorter survival (7, 9, 10). However,
despite being able to induce a CRPC growth phenotype,
ectopically expressed AR-Vs were shown to remain dependent on activity of endogenous full-length AR (11). Therefore,
it has been concluded that constitutive AR-V activity in CRPC
tissues could be overcome by targeting full-length AR with
antiandrogens.
Recent studies showing AR gene rearrangements in CRPC
that underlie functional AR-V expression and activity have
revealed scenarios where full-length AR activity may not be
required in CRPC cells (12, 13). Foremost, the LuCaP 86.2

xenograft derived from CRPC bladder metastasis harbors an
8.5-kb intragenic deletion of AR exons 5 to 7, which prevents
full-length AR synthesis but favors expression of a truncated
AR-V species encoded by mRNA lacking exons 5 to 7 (12). The
22Rv1 and CWR-R1 models of CRPC also harbor underlying AR
gene rearrangements, leading to coexpression of full-length AR
and AR-Vs (12, 13). The effects of targeting full-length AR on
AR-V function have not been evaluated in these rearrangement-driven models. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
to test the roles of full-length and AR-V species in supporting
the CRPC phenotype and mediating responsiveness to enzalutamide in the context of rearrangement-driven changes in AR
splicing.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The 22Rv1 (#CRL-2505) and LNCaP (#CRL-1740) cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and cultured according to the ATCC protocol. The
ATCC ensures authenticity of these human cell lines using
short tandem repeat (STR) analyses. All experiments with these
cells were conducted within 4 months of resuscitation of frozen
cell stocks prepared within 3 passages of receipt from the
ATCC. CWR-R1 cells (14) were a kind gift from Dr. Elizabeth
Wilson (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel
Hill, NC) and cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS. Authentication of the CWR-R1 cell line was conducted by sequencebased validation of 2 signature AR gene alterations: an AR
H874Y point mutation and a 50-kb intragenic deletion within
AR intron 1 (13). Sequence-based authentication of CWR-R1
was carried out every 5 to 10 passages, and cells were kept in
culture no longer than 3 months after authentication unless
otherwise indicated. Details of cell treatment with bicalutamide (AstraZeneca) or enzalutamide (a kind gift from Dr.
Michael Jung, University of California, Los Angeles, Los
Angeles, CA) are provided in the Supplementary Material.
Transient transfections
Cells were electroporated with siRNAs targeted to AR Exon
7 (15), AR Exon 1 (15), AR Exon 2b (15), AR Exon CE3 (10), or a
mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase (MMTV-LUC) reporter
as described previously (15). Growth of electroporated cells was
monitored by crystal violet staining as described earlier (12).
Luciferase activity was measured as previously described (15).
Lentiviral infections
LNCaP cells were infected with increasing titers of lentivirus
encoding AR 1/2/3/CE3 and AR D5/6/7 as described previously
(6). Infected cells were maintained in RPMI1640 with 10%
charcoal-stripped, steroid-depleted serum (CSS) for 48 hours
and then switched to serum-free medium for 24 hours before
lysis.
Western blot
Western blotting with AR NTD (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AR CTD (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ERK-2
(D-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies was carried out as
described previously (12).

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from 22Rv1, CWR-R1, and LNCaP
cells as described previously (16). Primers and quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) conditions for assessment of prostate speciﬁc antigen (PSA), hK2, and TMPRSS2
mRNA expression have been described previously (15). Androgen- and AR variant-responses of M–phase-speciﬁc genes were
assessed using speciﬁc primers with sequences provided in
Supplementary Material. Fold change in mRNA expression
levels was calculated by the comparative Ct method, using the
formula 2 (DDCt) and GAPDH as calibrator, as described previously (15).
Genomic PCR
Primers and PCR conditions for deletion-spanning PCR of
the AR intron 1 deletion in CWR-R1 cells have been described
previously (13).
Gene expression analysis with Illumina Beadchips
CWR-R1 cells that had been maintained in long-term culture
in RPMI1640 with 10% CSS were used for global gene expression proﬁling. These CWR-R1 cells were electroporated with
siRNAs targeting AR exon 1, 7, or CE3, and seeded in RPMI with
10% CSS. Following 48-hour recovery, cells were switched to
serum-free RPMI1640 and treated for 24 hours with 1 nmol/L
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 0.01% (v/v) vehicle control
(ethanol). Details of RNA isolation, Illumina Beadchip hybridization, and data analysis are provided as Supplementary
Material. Data are available through NCBI's Gene Expression
Omnibus (GSE41784).

Results and Discussion
AR-Vs are sufﬁcient for resistance to enzalutamide in
22Rv1 cells
The CRPC 22Rv1 cell line is characterized by a 35-kb tandem
duplication encompassing AR exon 3 (12). This rearrangement
is associated with enhanced mRNA and protein expression of
truncated AR-Vs AR 1/2/3/2b and AR 1/2/3/CE3 (also referred
to as AR-V7/AR3; refs. 6, 9, 10, 12). The 22Rv1 cells display
robust growth under castrated conditions, which was unaffected by the antiandrogens bicalutamide or enzalutamide
(Fig. 1A). However, both bicalutamide and enzalutamide were
able to antagonize androgen-mediated activation of the AR
target genes PSA and hK2 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) as well as
an AR-responsive MMTV-LUC reporter (Fig. 1B), showing that
these drugs can achieve on-target inhibition of full-length AR in
these cells. Similarly, androgen-induced MMTV activity was
blocked following selective knockdown of full-length AR (Fig.
1B). However, knockdown of AR-Vs resulted in robust inhibition of constitutive, androgen-independent MMTV-LUC activity. Similarly, constitutive, androgen-independent expression
of PSA and hK2 was blocked by AR-V knockdown, but not by
manipulations that block full-length AR (bicalutamide, enzalutamide, full-length AR knockdown, or AR knockdown combined with antiandrogens, Fig. 1C). Interestingly, constitutive
AR-V activity appeared to maintain TMPRSS2 expression at
a maximal AR-inducible level, as there was no response to

Truncated AR Splice Variants and Enzalutamide Resistance

Figure 1. AR-Vs support resistance to full-length AR targeting in 22Rv1 cells. A, 22Rv1 cells were cultured under castrate (CSS) conditions with

androgens (Supplementary Fig. S1B), but expression was inhibited by AR-V knockdown (Fig. 1C). Together, these data show
that AR-Vs are independent effectors of constitutive AR transcriptional activity in these cells. To test the biological implications of this, we assessed the effects of androgens and
antiandrogens on the growth of 22Rv1 cells under conditions
of full-length versus AR-V knockdown. Remarkably, knockdown of AR-Vs, but not full-length AR, reduced the androgenindependent growth rate of these cells and restored robust
growth-responsiveness to androgens (Fig. 1D). Perhaps more
importantly, AR-V knockdown restored the ability of antiandrogens to inhibit this newly acquired androgen-dependent
growth phenotype (Fig. 1D). On the basis of this ﬁnding, we
conclude that AR-Vs are sufﬁcient for resistance of 22Rv1 cells
to therapies targeting full-length AR, including enzalutamide.
AR gene rearrangements mark AR-V-driven,
enzalutamide-resistant cells in heterogenous PCa cell
populations
Recently, we discovered a 48-kb AR intron 1 deletion in a
subset of cells in the heterogeneous CWR-R1 cell line
(ref. 13; Fig. 2A). Single-cell cloning revealed that cells positive

for the 48-kb deletion displayed high-level expression of the AR
1/2/3/CE3 variant (Fig. 2B). Conversely, cells that were negative for the 48-kb deletion expressed predominantly full-length
AR (Fig. 2B). Sub-clones negative for the 48-kb AR intragenic
deletion displayed a basal level of androgen-independent
growth, which was enhanced by DHT (Fig. 2C). This basal
level of androgen-independent growth was reduced by treatment with bicalutamide or enzalutamide, indicating that fulllength AR was required (Fig. 2C). Conversely, sub-clones
positive for the 48-kb AR intragenic deletion displayed rapid
androgen-independent growth, which was unaffected by
androgens (Supplementary Fig. S2) or antiandrogens (Fig.
2D). However, selective knockdown of AR 1/2/3/CE3 inhibited
androgen-independent growth of these rearrangement-positive cells (Fig. 2D).
To verify that this property of enzalutamide resistance was
not restricted to a few rare cells, we tested the effects of
antiandrogens on a version of the CWR-R1 cell line that had
been propagated for the long term under castrated conditions.
We have previously shown that long-term castration enriches
for the AR intron 1 deletion-positive population (13), which AR
gene copy number analysis showed was approximately 97% of

the population (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Similar to 22Rv1
cells, androgen-independent growth of deletion-enriched
CWR-R1 cells was insensitive to bicalutamide and enzalutamide (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Nevertheless, antiandrogens
were able to achieve on-target activity and inhibit androgeninduced MMTV-LUC activation (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
However, only AR-V knockdown was able to inhibit constitutive, androgen-independent MMTV activity (Supplementary
Fig. S3C). This is in line with our previous work showing that
androgen-independent growth of deletion-enriched CWR-R1
cells is not affected by knockdown of full-length AR, but can
be blocked by knockdown of AR 1/2/3/CE3 (13). Therefore, we
conclude that the 48-kb AR intron 1 deletion can discriminate
between individual cells in the heterogeneous CWR-R1 cell line
that are enzalutamide-responsive and cells that are driven by
AR-V activity and resistant to inhibition of full-length AR.
AR-Vs are independent effectors of the androgen/AR
transcriptional program
AR-Vs have been reported to induce unique transcriptional
targets such as AKT1 (9), which may play a role in enzalutamide resistance (17). However, in AR intron 1 deletionenriched CWR-R1 cells, we did not observe any changes in
AKT1 expression following AR 1/2/3/CE3 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, to understand the mechanistic
basis for AR-V–mediated resistance to enzalutamide, we carried out gene expression proﬁling of deletion-enriched CWR-

R1 cells. Because constitutive activity of AR-Vs can mask
androgen/AR induction targets (and vice versa) we assessed
the androgen/AR transcriptional program following AR 1/2/3/
CE3 knockdown and assessed the AR-V transcriptional program following full-length AR knockdown (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S5). Many, but not all, of the genes responsive
to androgen/AR activity were similarly activated/repressed in
a constitutive manner by AR 1/2/3/CE3 in these cells (Fig. 3B).
This suggested that the AR-V transcriptional program represented a subset of the broader androgen/AR transcriptional
program. Indeed, when we focused on AR-V responsive genes,
nearly all were regulated in the exact same manner by androgen/AR activity (Fig. 3C). These data conﬁrm that AR-Vs are
constitutive and independent effectors of the AR transcriptional program, which explains why androgens and AR-Vs can
support maximal growth of the same cell line in an interchangeable fashion (Fig. 1D). In line with this idea, the only
knowledge-based multi-gene signaling networks identiﬁed as
being associated with androgen/AR and AR-V gene signatures
had AR as the prominent central hub (Supplementary Fig. S6).
These ﬁndings are in opposition to a recent study showing
that AR-Vs have gene signatures distinct from full-length AR,
including a set of genes involved in M-phase cell-cycle progression (18). To understand the basis for this discrepancy, we
used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 19) to test the
response of this AR-V-speciﬁc set of M-phase genes (18) in
CWR-R1 cells. This AR-V-responsive M-phase gene set was

positively enriched in both androgen/AR and AR-V gene
expression datasets derived from CWR-R1 cells (Fig. 3D).
Similarly, a gene set deemed to be full-length AR-speciﬁc
(18) was positively enriched in both of these CWR-R1–derived
gene expression datasets (Fig. 3D). Therefore, these signatures
could not discriminate between AR-V and androgen/AR activity in CWR-R1 cells.
AR-Vs have been shown to drive biphasic AR signaling in a
manner similar to androgens (6). Therefore, we hypothesized
that differences previously noted between AR-V and full-length
AR transcriptional programs could have risen from comparing
different strengths of AR transcriptional output from AR-Vs
compared with androgens. To test this, we carried out GSEA
with gene expression datasets derived from LNCaP cells treated with 1 nmol/L DHT (a pro-proliferative dose) or 100 nmol/L
DHT (an antiproliferative dose). As expected, the full-length AR
signature displayed positive enrichment in both the 1 nmol/L
DHT and 100 nmol/L DHT gene expression datasets (Supplementary Fig. S7). Conversely, the AR-V-speciﬁc signature displayed positive enrichment in the 1 nmol/L DHT dataset, but
strong negative enrichment in the 100 nmol/L DHT dataset
(Fig. 4A). Therefore, these data indicate that the AR-V-speciﬁc
signature does not discriminate between AR-V and full-length

AR signaling, but rather reﬂects proliferative versus growthsuppressive levels of AR signaling output. To test this further,
we treated LNCaP cells with androgens at concentrations
that cover the range of proliferative and growth suppressive
doses (0.1–100 nmol/L DHT) and assessed expression of Mphase genes UBE2C, CDCA5, ZWINT, and CCNA2. Whereas
PSA expression increased concomitant with increasing
androgen concentration, all of the M–phase-speciﬁc genes
displayed a biphasic response: induction at low androgen
concentrations and/or repression at higher doses (Fig. 4B).
Similarly, when increasing titers of lentivirus encoding the
AR 1/2/3/CE3 (AR-V7/AR3) variant (Fig. 4C) or the AR D5/6/
7 (ARv567es) variant (Fig. 4D) were used for infection, similar
biphasic responses were observed for M–phase-speciﬁc
genes, but not PSA. Therefore, these data challenge the
notion that AR-Vs have acquired unique transcriptional
targets and provide strong support for the concept that
AR-Vs are independent effectors of the androgen/AR transcriptional program.
In summary, these data provide the ﬁrst demonstration that
AR-V expression driven by AR gene rearrangements can mediate resistance to therapies targeting full-length AR, including
the next generation antiandrogen enzalutamide/MDV3100.

These studies are signiﬁcant because resistance, either de novo
or acquired during therapy, is a major clinical limitation for
new AR-axis inhibitors (4, 20). Importantly, the majority of
patients that display disease progression on enzalutamide also
display rising PSA, indicating that enzalutamide-resistant
tumors remain driven by persistent AR activity (3). AR-Vs are
