ABSTRACT
Alterations in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and in PTEN (phosphatase
and tensin homolog), the negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, are found in
nearly half of human tumors. As PI3Kβ, the main isoform activated in PTEN-mutant
tumors, has kinase-dependent and -independent activities, we compared the effects
of depleting vs. drug-inhibiting PI3Kβ kinase activity in a collection of diverse tumor
types and in a set of bladder carcinoma cell lines grown as xenografts in mice. PI3Kβ
depletion (by intratumor injection of PIK3CB siRNA) induced apoptosis and triggered
regression of PTEN-mutant tumors more efficiently than PI3Kβ inhibition. A small
proportion of these tumors was resistant to PI3Kβ downregulation; we analyzed
what determined resistance in these cases. Using add-back experiments, we show
that both PTEN mutation and low E-cadherin expression are necessary for PI3Kβ
dependence. In bladder carcinoma, loss of E-cadherin expression coincides with
N‑cadherin upregulation. We found that PI3Kβ associated with N-cadherin and that
PIK3CB depletion selectively disrupted N‑cadherin cell adhesions in PTEN-mutant
bladder carcinoma. These results support the use of PIK3CB interfering RNA as a
therapeutic approach for high-risk bladder cancers that show E‑cadherin loss and
express mutant PTEN.

INTRODUCTION

but enhanced PI3Kβ expression is sufficient to induce
transformation [12]. PI3Kβ levels are increased in colon,
ovarian, endometrial, breast and bladder carcinoma [3, 5,
9, 10].
In the mouse, expression of active PI3Kβ leads
to intraepithelial prostate neoplasia and Pik3cb deletion
inhibits prostate cancer in Pten+/- mice [13, 14]. These
observations led to studies in xenograft models, which
showed that PI3Kβ inhibitors decelerate tumor growth in
PTEN-mutant tumors [15-17]. The correlation between
PTEN loss of function and PI3Kβ inhibitor-mediated
cytostatic effect is not universal, and the mechanism
underlying PTEN and PI3Kβ cooperation is unclear [5,
18-20]. PI3K is considered a key target for cancer therapy,
but only enzymatic inhibitors have been tested clinically
[21-23]. Some of these studies are promising, but others

Enhanced activity of the class IA phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequent in cancer [1-6].
PI3K are lipid kinases encoded by PIK3 genes, of which
PIK3CA and CB are ubiquitous [1-6]. After activation by
growth factors, PI3K generate phosphoinositide (PI)(3,4,5)
P3 at the plasma membrane; this stimulates downstream
targets such as PKB and mTOR, which trigger cell
survival, division, and migration. The phosphatase PTEN
reduces PI(3,4,5)P3 levels [6]. PIK3CA mutations appear
at early stages in cancer progression, whereas PTEN
inactivation is a later event [3-10]. The role of PI3Kβ in
cancer is less understood; PIK3CB mutations in cancer
appear at lower frequency than those of PIK3CA [5, 11],

have failed due to blockade of feedback mechanisms or
acquisition of resistance [5, 21-23]. Since PI3Kβ generates
PI(3,4,5)P3 but also has kinase-independent functions
[24-26], we tested the effect of depleting PI3Kβ using
interfering RNA (siRNA) on a collection of diverse tumor
types and in a set of urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC)
lines.
UBC is the fifth most frequent tumor in developed
countries; although the majority of these tumors (75%) are
non muscle-invasive (NMI) and treatable by transurethral
resection, many recur (70%) and up to 10-15% progress
to muscle-invasive (MI) metastatic carcinoma, with
poor prognosis [1, 2, 5. The molecular mechanisms that
underlie UBC invasiveness must thus be identified, as well
as new therapeutic strategies for MI-UBC.
We tested the effect of depleting PI3Kβ in these
tumors, since UBC tumors show enhanced PI3Kβ
expression, loss of PTEN function at advanced stages,
and accessibility for local administration of siRNA [4, 7,
10]. We show that PI3Kβ depletion is cytotoxic for most
tumors with mutant PTEN. Treatment of PTEN-mutant
tumor xenografts by intratumor (i.t.) injection of PIK3CB
siRNA (siPIK3CB) or by expression of doxycycline
(doxy)-inducible PIK3CB shRNA was markedly more
potent than PI3Kβ inhibition. Some PTEN-mutant tumor
cells were resistant to siPIK3CB; we took advantage of
this phenotype to study what determines resistance. We
show that PTEN inactivation and E-cadherin (E-cad) loss
are necessary for sensitivity. These observations support
development of PIK3CB-interfering approaches for
treatment of advanced UBC with E‑cad loss and PTEN
mutations.

(12.5, 50, 120 pmol/mm3 tumor) on days 1, 3 and 5,
and effects were tested on day 7. The 50pmol/mm3 dose
of siPIK3CB1optimally reduced PI3Kβ levels in PC3
xenografts and the PI3Kβ -dependent [25] PCNA binding
to chromatin (Supplementary Figure S1b).
To study the effect of PI3K depletion on PC3
tumor growth, we divided a set of mice bearing ~75
mm3 tumors into random groups, which we treated with
PBS, liposomes, or liposomes plus control or siPIK3CB1
(50pmol/mm3). Treatment was administered three times a
week for two weeks. Repeated injection with liposomes
decelerated tumor growth; nonetheless, siPIK3CB delivery
triggered tumor regression (Supplementary Figure S1c).
siRNA delivery at the end of treatment might have been
suboptimal due to the small tumor size; optimal PIK3CB
depletion might have yielded additional effects. Using
representative PC3 tumor extracts, we showed that PI3Kβ
knockdown reduced pPKB levels and PCNA binding to
chromatin (Supplementary Figure S1d). Histopathology
analysis of representative samples showed that whereas
necrotic areas in vehicle and control siRNA-treated tumors
did not exceed 10% of the tumor, the cell death index in
siPIK3CB1-treated tumors reached 90-100% of cells in
60% of samples; all liposome-treated samples showed an
inflammatory neutrophil infiltration, which might explain
the tumor growth deceleration in the presence of vehicle
(Supplementary Figure S1e). TUNEL staining of tumor
sections showed that those treated with control siRNA
had few positive cells, and that siPIK3CB1 treatment
significantly increased TUNEL+ cells (Supplementary
Figure S1f).
We extended the analysis to a collection of cell
lines representative of distinct tumor types that expressed
wild-type (WT) PTEN (HT-29, SW480, NCI-H226,
HT1080), mutant PTEN (U87MG, MDA-MB468, BLM,
H520), or showed PTEN promoter methylation (CaLu1) [27]. We performed two transfections (days 1 and 3)
using siPIK3CB1 (0.2 nmol/0.5x106 cells) and tested
the consequences on day 5. PIK3CB silencing did not
affect WT PTEN lines but reduced viability of the cells
with PTEN loss of function, with the exception of MDAMB468 and H520 cells, which were resistant (Figure 1a1c). This shows that PTEN inactivation is necessary but
insufficient for PI3Kβ dependence.
To define which pathways could synergize with
PTEN inactivation to render the cells PI3Kβ-dependent,
we examined features frequently altered in cancer,
including E-cad levels, TP53 mutation and ERK activation
[28, 29]. All cells were pre-checked for TP53 mutations
(cansar.icr.uk/cansar/cell lines); we used Western blot
(WB) to evaluate pERK and E-cad levels (Figure 1d). The
siPIK3CB-responsive cells shared PTEN mutation and
low E-cad levels but presented variable pERK and TP53
status; accordingly, the two PTEN mutant resistant cells
(MDA-MB468 and H520) expressed high E-cad levels
(Figure 1d, 1e).

RESULTS
PTEN mutation is not sufficient for tumor PI3Kβ
dependence
PI3Kβ enzymatic inhibition retards the growth
of most PTEN-mutant tumor xenografts, but does not
trigger cell death [16, 18-20]. Since PI3Kβ has enzymatic
and non-enzymatic activities [24-26], we evaluated the
effect of depleting PIK3CB in xenografts. We optimized
PI3Kβ depletion using siRNA in PTEN-mutant prostate
cancer PC3 cells. Transfection of 0.5x106 cells with 6
to 12 pmol of siRNA1 or siRNA2 was sufficient for
efficient silencing and for reduction of cell viability
(Supplementary Figure S1a). We also grew PC3 cellderived xenografts in immunodeficient mice; when tumors
reached ~75 mm3, mice were treated with siRNA. As
systemic siRNA administration by intraperitoneal injection
(i.p.) did not deplete PI3Kβ efficiently in tumors (not
shown), we optimized administration by direct injection
into the tumor center of PIK3CB siRNA1 (siPIK3CB1)

PTEN mutation is not sufficient for PI3Kβ
dependence in bladder cancer

PI3Kβ depletion induces tumor regression in a
PTEN-mutant UBC

Previous studies using a few cell lines suggest that
PI3Kβ expression increases in UBC [9]; we examined a
large UBC collection from reported DNA microarrays
[30-32]. Samples were grouped as “normal tissue”, “lowgrade NMI” (G1-2, Ta-T1), and “high-grade tumors”
including NMI (G3, Ta-T2) and MI tumors (T3-T4).
“Low-grade tumors” had higher PIK3CB mRNA levels
than normal bladder tissue, and “high-grade tumors” had
the highest levels (Figure 2a). Data were confirmed in
two independent datasets; PIK3CB gene expression levels
were higher in “high-grade” than in “low-grade” tumors
[31, 32] (Figure 2a). These results show that increased
PIK3CB expression is frequent at advanced stages UBC.
We next studied 11 well-characterized UBC lines
[33]. We optimized siPIK3CB treatment in 639V UBC
cells (Supplementary Figure S2a-S2f); transfection
(0.5x106 cells) on day 1 and 3 with 0.2 nmol siPIK3CB1
efficiently depleted PI3Kβ by day 5 and reduced cell
viability (Figure 2b-2d), expression of PIK3CB shRNA
had a similar effect (Supplementary Figure S2a-S2f).
WT PTEN lines were resistant to PIK3CB silencing; of
the six PTEN-mutant or -low-expression lines, four were
sensitive, but UMUC-9 and -7 cells were resistant to
PI3Kβ depletion (Figure 2b-2d) confirming that PTEN loss
is insufficient for PI3Kβ dependency.
We also analyzed the sensitivity of the UBC lines to
a PI3Kβ inhibitor, AZD8186 [20]. 639V cells responded
to AZD8186 in a dose-dependent manner (72 h), but
cell death was lower than that detected upon siPIK3CB
transfection, examined in parallel; both siPIK3CB and
AZD8186 moderately reduced pPKB levels (Figure 3a3c). Analysis of the remaining lines (Supplementary
Figure S3a-S3c) showed that AZD8186 did not impair the
growth of WT PTEN cells; in mutant-PTEN lines (UMUC3, T24, J82), AZD8186 was less potent than siPIK3CB in
reducing cell numbers; the siPIK3CB-resistant UMUC9 and -7 lines were also resistant to PI3Kβ inhibitors;
responsive cells showed moderate reduction of pPKB
levels.
To confirm that a PI3Kβ scaffold function is more
important than its kinase activity for UBC cell survival,
we prepared an inactive siPIK3CB-resistant mutant
KR-PI3Kβ (KR‑PI3Kβ-si-res) that was not depleted by
siPIK3CB (Figure 3d-3f). Although KR-PI3Kβ expression
reduced pPKB more than siPIK3CB; KR- and KR-PI3Kβsi-res reduced viability moderately while PI3Kβ depletion
had a greater effect that was corrected by KR-PI3K-sires expression (Figure 3d-3f). Thus, a PI3Kβ kinaseindependent action contributes to cell survival in PTENmutant UBC.

To determine whether UBC also require PI3Kβ for
tumor growth in vivo, we treated 639V xenografts with
siPIK3CB. Tumors grew exponentially and when they
reached ~75 mm3, they were treated by i.t. injection of
PBS, liposomes, or liposomes plus control or siPIK3CB
(50pmol/mm3). Although liposomes decelerated tumor
growth, siPIK3CB was able to induce a partial tumor
regression (Figure 4a). Considering that liposomes
decelerated tumor growth, to confirm the effect of
depleting PIK3CB in an alternative method, we generated
tumors using 639V cells that expressed doxy-inducible
shPIK3CB. When tumors were ~75 mm3, mice were
treated by addition of doxy in the drinking water (4 mg/
ml) for two weeks. PI3Kβ depletion was partial (see
below); nonetheless, tumors from untreated mice grew
exponentially, while tumors from doxy-treated mice
failed to grow or reduced its size (~50%) (Figure 4b). We
also treated the tumors by i.p. injection with the PI3Kβ
inhibitor AZD8186 [20] (40 mg/kg, every 12 h, 16 days).
Pharmacological inhibition only moderately decelerated
tumor growth (Figure 4c) and was associated with greater
toxicity as 20% of treated mice had to be sacrificed
prematurely due to weight loss.
PI3Kβ depletion in the tumors induced caspase 3
cleavage, reduced PI3Kβ expression and decreased PCNA
levels in chromatin; it also slightly lowered pPKB levels;
AZD8186 treatment reduced pPKB and PCNA chromatin
binding and had a low effect on caspase 3 (Figure 4d).
PIK3CB shRNA only partially depleted PI3Kβ; optimal
PIK3CB depletion might have yielded additional effects.
Histopathology analysis showed a moderate inflammatory
infiltration in liposome-treated samples, few necrotic
cells in controls and a large percentage of dead cells in
siPIK3CB-treated tumors (50‑100%) (Figure 4e). This
analysis shows that PI3Kβ depletion reduced UBC tumor
growth more markedly than PI3Kβ inhibition.

E-cad/N-cad expression determines PTEN-mutant
UBC dependence on PI3Kβ
PI3Kβ depletion in UBC showed that PTEN loss
of function is necessary but not sufficient for PI3Kβ
dependence. We compared the TP53 mutation status
[33] and E‑cad levels in the UBC lines. Of the six lines
exhibiting PTEN loss of function, the four PI3Kβdependent cells had little or no E-cad, and expressed
90 or 130 kDa N-cad forms; in contrast, the siPIK3CBresistant cells (UMUC-9 and -7) expressed high E-cad
levels (Figure 5a), suggesting that also in UBC low E-cad
expression is needed for PI3Kβ dependence.
Pten loss of function cooperates with Lkb1 or
Tp53 mutations to initiate EMT, which is associated

showed that PTEN loss of function was frequently linked
with N-cad increase in UBC. Since E-cad loss and the
accompanying increase in N-cad levels are needed for
PI3Kβ dependence in UCB, we postulated that PI3Kβ
might regulate N-cad adhesions. We treated PI3Kβdependent (639V or J82) or PI3Kβ-independent UBC cells
(SW780 or RT112) (0.5x106) with AZD8186 for three
days, or transfected them with siPIK3CB1 (as above) and
we examined cell-cell adhesions by immunofluorescence
(IF).
E-cad adhesions in SW780 cells were virtually
unaffected by PI3Kβ depletion or inhibition. E-cad and
β-catenin (β-cat) colocalized at cell-cell interaction
regions similarly in controls than in cells treated with
AZD8186 or with siPIK3CB1, as examined by E-cad/β-cat
signal quantitation at cell membranes (Figure 7a). We also
detected N-cad/β-cat colocalization at plasma membranes
of 639V and J82 cells treated with control siRNA or
AZD8186; in contrast, PI3Kβ depletion severely disrupted
N-cad localization at cell-cell adhesions (Figure 7a).
Examination of the percentage of cells exhibiting N-cad
(or E-cad) colocalization with β-cat at cell-cell adhesions
confirmed that PI3Kβ did not affect E-cad adhesions but
impaired N-cad localization in ~75% of 639V and J82
cells (Figure 7b).
To test whether interference of N-cad adhesions
could promote cell death, we used interfering peptides
for N-cad and E-cad in 639V and J82 cells; incubation
with specific peptides for N-cad reduced cell viability in
639V and J82 cells (Supplementary Figure S6). PTEN
alterations in UBC associate with N-cad upregulation; our
findings suggest that PI3Kβ controls cell survival in these
UBC by regulating N-cad adhesion integrity.

with E-cad loss and N-cad expression [29, 34]. Using
the Cancer Genome Atlas UBC tumor collection, we
evaluated whether PTEN loss of function was linked
to E-cad (CDH1) downregulation or N-cad (CDH2)
expression. PTEN alterations in UBC were associated
with CDH2 upregulation (P = 0.01, www.cbioportal.org)
(Supplementary Figure S4). Of the samples with altered
PTEN and CDH1, 75% showed parallel gain or loss of
function in both genes; in contrast, 75% of samples with
alterations in PTEN and CDH2 showed an inverse pattern
of alterations in both genes (Figure 5b). This suggests
that PTEN loss of function is associated to E-cad loss and
N-cad upregulation in UBC.
The association of PTEN loss of function with CDH2
upregulation made difficult to find mutant PTEN UBC
lines that expressed E-cad (two in the UBC collection; two
in the diverse tumor set). To explore the hypothesis that
low E-cad levels and PTEN mutation are both necessary
for UBC dependence on PI3Kβ, we used a genetic
approach and examined the effect of E-cad reconstitution
in a responsive cell line lacking E-cad expression (639V)
or its depletion in an E-cad-expressing resistant cell line
(UMUC-9). E-cad reconstitution rendered 639V cells
resistant to PIK3CB shRNA, whereas E-cad reduction
yielded UMUC-9 cells sensitive to PIK3CB depletion
(Figure 5c-5e). pPKB levels were moderately reduced by
PI3Kβ depletion in E-cad-low 639V cells, but pPKB was
unaffected by PI3Kβ depletion in WT or E‑cad-depleted
UMUC-9 cells (Figure 5c). We confirmed that PIK3CB
depletion induced apoptosis in E-cad-depleted but not in
control UMUC-9 cells (Supplementary Figure S5).

E-cadherin depletion sensitizes PTEN-mutant
UBC tumors to PIK3CB silencing in vivo

PI3Kβ associates with N-cadherin

To confirm the sensitivity of control and E-cadlow UMUC-9 cells to PIK3CB silencing in vivo, we used
UMUC-9 cells stably expressing CDH1 shRNA and doxyinducible PIK3CB shRNA. When xenografts reached ~75
mm3, we administered doxycycline. PIK3CB-depletion
moderately affected UMUC-9 xenografts growth;
moreover, PIK3CB-depletion induced regression of E-cadlow UMUC-9 tumors (Figure 6a). Histopathology analysis
of representative tumors at assay termination showed that,
at difference from controls, tumor vestiges from E-cad-low
PIK3CB shRNA-treated UMUC-9 cells were composed
essentially of dying or dead cells; TUNEL analysis of
these samples confirmed apoptosis in PIK3CB shRNAtreated tumors from E-cad-low UMUC-9 cells (Figure 6b,
6c).

PI3Kβ expression is needed for N-cad adhesions
integrity; we tested whether PI3Kβ could bind to N-cad
and thereby exert a scaffold function for N-cad membrane
localization. We first examined PI3Kα and PI3Kβ
levels in E-cad+ SW780 cells and N-cad+ 639V cells.
To determine the PI3Kα / PI3Kβ ratios in the cells, we
immunoprecipitated PI3Kα and PI3Kβ from extracts of
SW780 and 639V cells (900 µg). As PI3K associates 1:1
with p85, we compared the amount of p85/PI3Kα and p85/
PI3Kβ complexes by examining in WB the associated
p85 subunit. To check that the immunoprecipitation (IP)
was efficient we confirmed that the supernatants of the IP
were depleted of the PI3Kα or β; both cell lines showed
moderately higher levels of p85/PI3Kβ than p85/PI3Kα
(Figure 8a). E-cad IP from SW780 cell extracts followed
by WB with PI3Kα or PI3Kβ Ab showed that E-cad
preferentially associates PI3Kα (Figure 8b). A similar
analysis after N-cad IP from 639V extracts showed that
N-cad preferentially associates PI3Kβ (Figure 8b). For
quantitation, we referred the amount of PI3Kα or β

depletion abolished this signal (Figure 8c).

two weeks; intravesical infusion with a defective virus
encoding PIK3CB shRNA or the use of novel non-toxic
vehicles, currently under development [45], might be
suitable reagents for PIK3CB depletion. Several siRNA
targets are currently in clinical trials, and the large
number of successful phase II and III trials for human
disease predicts the incorporation of these therapies for
medical applications [46, 28]. Development of antisense
oligonucleotides [47] or application of the successful
CRISPR-Cas approach [48] for PIK3CB deletion might
also be useful for local treatment of advanced UBC (T2b
and beyond) bearing PTEN mutations.
PI3Kβ depletion was more effective than its
inhibition in reducing UBC tumor growth; whereas
the inhibitor AZD8186 decelerated tumor expansion,
PI3Kβ depletion induced caspase 3 cleavage and tumor
regression. The observation that PI3Kβ has both enzymatic
and non-enzymatic functions [24-26] might explain the
effectiveness of siPIK3CB in the PTEN-mutant tumors.
We tested the contribution of the PI3Kβ scaffold function
in several ways. We compared the effect of depleting or
inhibiting PI3Kβ in the growth of UBC lines in culture.
PTEN loss of function was necessary for sensitivity to
PI3Kβ inhibition or depletion, however, cell numbers were
moderately reduced by inhibitor and markedly reduced by
PI3Kβ depletion. pPKB levels were unchanged or only
modestly diminished by PI3Kβ depletion. Moreover,
whereas expression of an inactive KR-PI3Kβ reduced
639V cell viability moderately, PI3Kβ depletion had a
greater effect on cell death induction, which was reduced
by co-expression of a siPIK3CB-resistant inactive PI3Kβ
mutant. We also found that PI3Kβ depletion has a more
potent effect than its inhibition on disruption of N-cad
adhesions. These observations support a PI3Kβ scaffold
function in UBC survival.
A small proportion of PTEN-defective cells were
resistant to PIK3CB silencing; we evaluated the molecular
characteristics of these cell lines. The all four siPIK3CBresistant PTEN-mutant cells (two UBC and two from
the diverse tumor set) exhibited had high E‑cad levels.
Invasive UBC show PTEN defects (58% of tumors) [9, 10,
39], PIK3CB upregulation, and mesenchymal phenotypes
[35, 49-51]. In the mouse, Pten loss of function cooperates
with Lkb1 or Tp53 mutation to initiate EMT, which
induces E-cad downregulation and N-cad expression
[29, 34-36]. We examined the Cancer Genome Atlas
bladder cancer collection (www.cancergenome.nih.gov)
to evaluate the possible linkage of PTEN mutation and
E-cad or N-cad expression in UBC. Simultaneous TP53
and PTEN mutation did not correlate with changes in
E-cad or N-cad expression, nonetheless, PTEN alterations
in UBC were associated with CDH2 upregulation (P =
0.01, www.cbioportal.org) supporting a link between
PTEN and E-cad/N-cad expression changes. Moreover,
using a genetic approach, we found that E‑cad‑expression
in 639V-PI3Kβ-dependent cells made them resistant

DISCUSSION
There is increasing evidence that inhibition of
oncogenic kinases activities does not equate to the
reduction of their expression. This is the case of PI3Kβ,
whose expression, rather than its activity, is necessary
from the onset of embryonic development [24‑26]. We
explored the therapeutic potential of local PIK3CB siRNA
delivery on PTEN-mutant tumors, since PI3Kβ is the main
isoform activated in these tumors [15]. After examining a
set of 10 unrelated cancer cell lines, we focused on a panel
of 11 bladder carcinoma cells (UBC), as these tumors
have PTEN mutations and increased PI3Kβ expression.
In most PTEN-mutant UBC cells, PIK3CB knockdown
induced apoptosis and effectively led to tumor regression;
PI3Kβ depletion was markedly more efficient than PI3Kβ
inhibition. The apoptotic response was absent in a few
samples, which provided an opportunity to determine
the molecular requirements for PI3Kβ dependence. Our
results suggest that PTEN mutation and concomitant
E-cad loss (found in invasive UBC) are needed for PI3Kβ
dependence. In parallel to E-cad loss, UBC express N-cad
[35], which controls cell survival [38]. We show that
PI3Kβ associates with and regulates N-cad adhesion.
Approximately half of human cancers have
mutations in PI3K or in its negative regulator PTEN; the
latter are more frequent at advanced tumor phases [3, 4,
39]. PI3K inhibitors have been tested clinically; some
of these studies hold promise, but others have failed
due to blockade of PI3K feedback pathway regulation
or generation of resistance [21-23, 40-42], making
necessary the development of additional therapeutic
approaches. As proof of concept for siRNA-based local
treatment of UBC, we optimized i.t. injection of siRNA
in UBC xenografts. Local siRNA delivery is anticipated
to reduce dose requirements and minimize toxicity [43,
44]. i.t. siRNA delivery reduced xenograft size, triggered
apoptosis, and was more effective than PI3Kβ inhibition,
which supports siRNA injection as a feasible approach.
The vehicle used, however, showed partial toxicity,
been necessary development of optimal siRNA vehicles.
Since all vehicle- (liposome) treated samples showed an
inflammatory neutrophil infiltration, it is possible that
an action of PIK3CB siRNA in the tumor environment
contributes to tumor growth deceleration.
Local delivery appears to be suitable for tumors
with increased PIK3CB expression that are accessible
to local administration, such as bladder cancer. Indeed,
high-risk non-MI UBC is currently treated by intravesical
therapy with Bacille-Calmette Guerin [7], and siPIK3CB
treatment can be reduced to two injections a week for

to PI3Kβ depletion while E-cad silencing sensitized
UMUC-9 cells to PIK3CB depletion. This suggests that
siPIK3CB resistance in PTEN mutant UBC is due to E-cad
expression.
siPIK3CB-sensitive and insensitive lines can be
distinguished by E-cad/N-cad levels; we studied the
consequences of depleting or inhibiting PI3Kβ on cell-cell
adhesions. We used two E-cad-high (PI3Kβ-insensitive)
and two E-cad-low/N-cad-positive (PI3Kβ-sensitive) UBC
lines. In insensitive lines, cell adhesions were unaffected
by PI3Kβ depletion or inhibition; in sensitive lines, PI3Kβ
inhibition moderately reduced, but PI3Kβ depletion
abrogated, N-cad-adhesions in more than 75% of the
cells. PI3Kβ expression thus regulates N-cad adhesions
in UBC. We show that E-cad bound preferentially PI3Kα
in PTEN-WT SW780 cells; in PTEN-mutant 639V cells,
N-cad bound to preferentially PI3Kβ. As cell adhesions
are needed for UBC cell survival (Figure S6), these results
suggest that PI3Kβ exhibits a scaffold function for N-cad
adhesions stabilization, which regulate UBC survival.
Acquisition of resistance in 639V cells after E-cad
expression can be explained by considering that PI3Kβ
depletion does not affect E-cad adhesions. We also show
that E-cad reduction in UMUC‑9 cells renders them
sensitive to PI3Kβ depletion although these cells do not
express N-cad. The reduction in E-cad levels and an
additional survival effect mediated by PI3Kβ (such as Bim
regulation, data not shown) might explain their sensitivity
to PIK3CB depletion.
PTEN alterations in UBC are associated with
CDH2 upregulation. In these cells, PI3Kβ associates
with and is needed to maintain N-cad cell adhesions. As
these adhesions regulate cell survival in UBC, disruption
of N-cad adhesions is at least part of the mechanism for
the greater cytotoxic effect of PI3Kβ depletion compared
to PI3Kβ inhibition in PTEN mutant UBC. There is
increasing evidence that high-risk non-MI bladder tumors
are precursors of MI cancers, with whom they share
genomic features [7]. High-risk tumors confined to the
bladder are generally treated by intravesical therapy,
but up to 30% progress to muscle-invasive UBC, which
have poor prognosis and often develop metastases. Our
results support the use of strategies that decrease PIK3CB
expression as a treatment for high-risk non-muscleinvasive bladder cancer with PTEN mutation and low
E-cad levels, a frequent phenotype in advanced urothelial
carcinoma.

Cell lines
We used the cell lines PC3 (ATCC-CRL-1435),
U87MG (ATCC-HTB-14), BLM (lung metastasis of
BRO melanoma cells, confirmed by typing the short
tandem repeat DNA profiles at Genomics Service,
Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas Alberto Sols,

10mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100µg/ml
streptomycin (37ºC, 5%CO2). We prepared UMUC-9
cell clones expressing shRNA for CDH1 using lentiviral
particles containing the pLKO-Puro-CDH1 shRNA.
Clones were selected in medium with puromycin (1-2µg/
mL). We similarly generated 693V lines overexpressing
E-cad using lentiviral particles containing the Dexinducible pLK-pac-CDH1 cDNA. Stable clones were
selected with puromycin (5µg/mL); E-cad expression
was induced in medium with 10 nM Dex (48 h). Clones
expressing pLKO-tet-PIK3CB-shRNA vector (doxyinducible) were prepared similarly and were selected in
medium containing G418 (0.8 mg/ml, 10 days).

Mice wearing xenografts treatment

Analysis of PIK3CB expression levels and of
PTEN, CDH1 and CDH2 changes in UBC

All procedures using mice were approved by
the Ethics Committee of the CNB/CSIC in accordance
with EU/Spanish legislation (RD53/2013). To generate
xenografts, cells (2.5-to-5x106) were suspended in
100 µl PBS containing 25% (639V and PC3 cells)
or 50% Matrigel (UMUC-9 cells) and were injected
subcutaneously (s.c.) into both flanks of 2-to-3-monthold immunodeficient CB17/lcrHsd-Prkdcscid/Lys bg-j
mice (Harlan). When tumors reached a mean size of
75 mm3, mice were treated by direct central intratumor
injection (Hamilton syringe 702N, 25 µl, 22-g bevel
tip needle) with vehicle, PBS alone, or either control
or siPIK3CB in Invivofectamine. siPIK3CB was
dissolved in PBS, followed by Invivofectamine (0.8:1
Invivofectamine:siRNA in PBS). siRNA doses were
12.5, 50 or 125 pmol/mm3 of tumor volume. For optimal
PIK3CB depletion, 50 pmol per mm3 of tumor volume
and dose siPIK3CB1 was sufficient and was used for
subsequent experiments. Mice were treated three times
weekly for two weeks, although two injections in two
weeks were similarly efficient.
When tumors of cells that expressed inducible
shPIK3CB reached ~75 mm3, silencing was induced
by doxy (4 mg/ml in H2O with 5% glucose) to drinking
water. Tumor-bearing mice also were treated by i.p.
injection with the PI3Kβ inhibitor AZD8186 (40 mg/kg)
in 0.5% methylcellulose, 0.2% Tween-20. Tumor size was
measured with a caliper and volume was calculated as (V)
= (smaller side length2 x larger side length)/2.

We evaluated PIK3CB mRNA levels based on
previously reported DNA microarray data. The first dataset
(94 samples), includes 9 normal bladder biopsies, 56 NMI
tumors and 29 MI tumors [30, 31] (GEO:GSE5287). The
second dataset (44 tumor samples, includes 34 NMI and
8 MI tumors [32] (GEO:GSE71576). These analyses
were performed using Affymetrix U133A:212688 and
Affymetrix 1.0 ST 8091009 probe hybridization data.
The third dataset was from ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/
arrayexpress/) with accession numbers E-MTAB-1803
for MI-UBC and E-MTAB-1940 for non-MI-UBC. RMA
software (v1.20) from Bioconductor was used to normalize
gene expression with express function and parameters by
default. We used the Cancer Genome Atlas [42] (TCGA)
bladder cancer collection (cancergenome.nih.gov) and the
software at http://www.cbioportal.org/index.do to examine
the relationship between PTEN, CDH1 and CDH2.

Statistical analyses
Gel band intensity was quantitated with ImageJ
software (NIH). Significance was calculated (GraphPad
Prism 5.0 Software) using one-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey’s multiple comparison test, Kruskal-Wallis, one- or
two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests, and Student’s t-tests.
