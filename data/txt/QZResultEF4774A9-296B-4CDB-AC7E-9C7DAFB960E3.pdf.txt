Determining the Optimal Dose and Schedule
of Sunitinib
Some Answers, More Questions
Cristina Suarez, MD1 and Brian I. Rini, MD2

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is characterized by genetic alterations in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
gene, which subsequently leads to activation of various proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).1 Sunitinib malate (Sutent; Pfizer, Inc, New York, NY) is an oral
multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3) among a
family of kinase targets. Animal studies have revealed that total drug plasma concentration (sunitinib plus its active metabolite) in the range of 50 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL was capable of inhibiting VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-b phosphorylation. Toxicological evaluation of animal models revealed bone marrow depletion and toxic effects in rats and monkeys, as well as
adrenal microhemorrhages in rats.2 To minimize potential bone marrow and adrenal toxicities in clinical evaluation,
health authorities requested an intermittent dosing schedule. Sunitinib was thus studied in cancer patients using various
schedules, including a 3-week cycle comprised of treatment for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period (schedule 2/1), a
4-week cycle comprising treatment for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period (schedule 2/2), or a 6-week cycle comprised of a 4-week treatment followed by a 2-week rest period (schedule 4/2). Phase 1 trials3,4 recommended an oral dose
of sunitinib of 50 mg using the 4/2 schedule. Dose-limiting toxicities included fatigue, hypertension, and bullous skin
toxicity.
Two open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trials5,6 were sequentially conducted with sunitinib (schedule 4/2) in patients
with mRCC and disease progression while receiving first-line cytokine therapy. Both studies demonstrated similar results,
with a progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 8.7 months in the first study and 8.3 months in the second and overall
response rates(ORRs) of 40% and 34%, respectively. Toxicities were similar to those observed in phase 1 studies. Subsequently, a phase 3 study7,8 enrolled 750 previously untreated patients with mRCC to receive either sunitinib (50 mg using
schedule 4/2) or interferon-a-2a (IFN) (9 MIU administered subcutaneously 3 times weekly). Results demonstrated a significant increase in PFS in the sunitinib arm (11 months vs 5 months; P < .001) and established this sunitinib dose and
schedule as a standard initial therapy in patients with mRCC.
Although the 4/2 interrupted schedule is accepted based on the data presented above, several considerations have led
to the investigation of continuous dosing schedules. The initial reasons for an interrupted schedule (bone marrow toxicity
and adrenal hemorrhage) have not become dose-limiting or quality-of-life–altering toxicities for the majority of patients.
Further, in one of the phase 2 trials,9 the concentration of sunitinib and its active metabolite declined to predose levels
during the 14-day resting period, indicating a potential lack of drug exposure during which tumors could potentially progress. Furthermore, circulating soluble VEGFR-2 and VEGF levels revealed a significant decrease in the concentration of
soluble VEGFR-2 and an increase in VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PIGF ) by the end of the 4-week dosing schedule, followed by a recovery to approximately baseline values by the end of the 2-week resting period. These observations
support a reversal of the desired pharmacodynamic effect during the 2 weeks the patients were off the drug.

Editorial/Suarez and Rini

In the study by Barrios et al published in this issue of
Cancer, 120 treatment-naive patients with mRCC were
enrolled in a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial of continuous once-daily sunitinib at a dose of 37.5 mg.10 The
primary endpoint was objective response and secondary
endpoints included duration of response, PFS, overall
survival (OS) at 1 year, total concentration of active drug
in the plasma (sunitinib plus the active metabolite,
SU12662), safety, pharmacokinetic measurements, identification of biomarkers of response, and patient-reported
outcomes. A partial response was achieved in 41 (34.7%)
of the 118 evaluable patients. The median PFS was 9
months, which is slightly shorter than the median PFS
observed in the phase 3 trial. The authors suggest that
these values might be the result of censoring the disease
progression data of 54 patients after only 1 year of assessment in this trial. The median duration of response was
10.4 months and the 1-year survival rate was 67.8%.
Analysis of the safety profile reveals a higher incidence of
hand-foot syndrome (43% of all grades and 13% grade
3-4 vs 20% and 5%, respectively) and mucosal inflammation (31% vs 20%) when compared with the phase 3 trial.
Despite the differences in the adverse events profile, the
percentage of dose reductions (32% vs 33%) was similar
in this and the phase 3 study. A continuous dosing schedule of sunitinib has been previously reported by Escudier
et al11 in an open-label phase 2 study. Sunitinib at a dose
of 37.5 mg was administered in a continuous once-daily
dosing regimen to 127 patients with cytokine-refractory
mRCC. An ORR of 20% and a median PFS of 8.9
months were observed. The safety profile of sunitinib
administered continuously at a dose of 37.5 mg/day was
found to be similar to previous RCC studies of schedule
4/2. Although prone to the significant limitations of
cross-trial comparisons, these studies suggested similar efficacy outcomes between the continuous and intermittent
dosing schedules and comparable toxicity.
A major consideration with the optimal sunitinib
dosing schedule concerns the drug levels achieved with
each regimen. In a retrospective study9 involving more
than 600 patients with advanced solid tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or RCC who were receiving
sunitinib, a direct relation between the steady-state concentration of total active drug in the plasma and time to
disease progression (TTP) and OS was identified. Patients
with mRCC with the highest exposure to sunitinib demonstrated a longer TTP and OS, a higher probability of
response, and greater decreases in tumor size. In addition,
pharmacokinetic analysis of data from studies in healthy

Cancer

volunteers and patients with cancer demonstrated high
interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics with a coefficient of variation in the range of 40% to 60%.12 Thus,
these data highlight the importance of maintaining sunitinib drug levels, but do not address which dose/schedule
achieves this more optimally in a given patient or for a
cohort of patients with RCC.
To the best of our knowledge, the recently reported
EFFECT trial offers the most definitive comparison of
these regimens. In this trial,13 first-line patients with
mRCC (n ¼ 292) were randomized 1:1 to receive sunitinib either at 50 mg using schedule 4/2 or 37.5 mg using
continuous dosing. This study revealed superior clinical
outcomes for schedule 4/2 (although not all comparisons
were significantly different). Schedule 4/2 also resulted in
higher steady-state trough sunitinib concentrations,
which is consistent with the retrospective data noted
above associating higher drug concentrations with better
clinical outcome. There were no significant differences
noted with regard to the adverse event profile. These data
highlight the extreme limitations of previous cross-trial
comparisons. As noted earlier, individual phase 2 data
suggested comparable efficacy and toxicity for the 2 different sunitinib dosing schemas, yet a more definitive
randomized comparison supports clear advantages for the
50-mg dose using the 4/2 schedule.
In conclusion, pharmacokinetic analyses and the
outcome of clinical trials have suggested that treating
patients at a lower dose intensity may result in reduced
efficacy. In addition, continuous dosing regimes of sunitinib at 37.5 mg have not demonstrated an improved
toxicological profile. Furthermore, patients receiving
continuous dosing who require a dose reduction because
of adverse events may be at risk of not achieving the target plasma concentrations. Therefore, the standard of
care for initial sunitinib administration remains 50 mg
daily on a 4/2 schedule. Adjustment for toxicity should
be to 37.5 mg, maintaining the 4/2 schedule. Of course,
individual patient tolerance can lead to other adjustments (eg, scheduling with 2 weeks on and 1 week off
for patients with poor tolerance confined to weeks 3 and
4 of dosing), but the data indicate that maintaining
daily dose intensity is more important than giving a
minimal dose each day. Unfortunately, because of the
large interindividual pharmacokinetic variation in previous studies, it is not possible to predetermine in which
patients a dose reduction will result in maintenance of
plasma drug levels or in suboptimal therapeutic dosing.
Ideally, individual patient dosing, as is performed for

certain antibiotics and immunosuppressive medications,
would allow for optimization of drug levels and thus efficacy while minimizing toxic effects. Such real-time
drug level data are not yet available, although investigative efforts currently are underway. For now, patient tolerance and clinical response must be used to guide
adequate sunitinib dosing while minimizing toxicity.
