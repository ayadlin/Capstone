BACKGROUND: The addition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors to radiotherapy has
produced increased locoregional control and has reduced mortality from various solid tumors with few
additional toxicities. Although anecdotal reports have suggested increased radiation dermatitis, the overall
effect of these regimens on dermatologic toxicities has not been ascertained. METHODS: Dermatologic
toxicity data were analyzed from abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, Cochrane Collaboration,
MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases. Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials that reported on radiation dermatitis, rash, and
mucositis were included. Collaborative group, phase 3, randomized radiotherapy and chemoradiation trials
served as controls. The summary incidence rate and relative risk were calculated using a random-effects or
fixed-effects model, depending on the heterogeneity of included studies. RESULTS: The summary incidence
of high-grade radiation dermatitis in patients who received radiation plus EGFR inhibitors was 31.3% (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 17.7%-49.1%), rash in 16.1% (95% CI, 12.8%-20.1%), and mucositis occurred in
52.7% (95% CI, 38.1%-66.9%). When the combination of radiotherapy plus EGFR inhibitors was compared
with radiation alone, the risk ratio for radiation dermatitis was 2.38 (95% CI, 1.8-3.2; P < .001), rash was 3.01
(95% CI, 2.0-4.6; P < .001), for mucositis it was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.5-2.0; P < .001), suggesting that there was an
increased risk of dermatologic toxicities with the combined regimen. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR inhibitors combined with radiation were associated with a significant increase in the risk for high-grade radiation dermatitis, rash, and mucositis. Although increased rash is expected with EGFR inhibitors, in-field dermatitis and
mucositis represent new safety concerns. Improved reporting and management strategies are critical for
quality of life and the optimization of radiation plus EGFR inhibitor protocols. Cancer 2009;115:1286–99.

Dermatologic Toxicity With RT and EGFR/Tejwani et al

The improved utility of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted anticancer therapies rests on
decreased systemic toxicities compared with cytotoxic
chemotherapy while achieving a positive antitumor
response. Similarly, novel radiotherapy regimens have
demonstrated the ability to deliver highly conformal doses
of radiation with limited dose delivered to normal tissue,
all of which has enhanced their integration into solid tumor protocols. Because aberrant EGFR signaling is associated not only with a poor prognosis and decreased
survival but also with the ability to confer cellular radioresistance, blockade of the EGFR resulting in radiosensitivity represents a key step in the optimization of targeted
anticancer therapies. In humans, the implementation of
this combined regimen has validated preclinical observations,1 and better tumor control and overall survival have
been achieved in cancers, including those of the head and
neck, rectum, lung, esophagus, cervix, and pancreas.
Combined protocols are investigating the use of radiation
plus EGFR inhibitors (EGFRIs), such as the chimeric immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody cetuximab (ImClone Systems, New York, NY; Bristol-Myers
Squibb, New York, NY), the human IgG2k antibody panitumumab (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif), and the
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib (OSI
Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY; Genentech, South San
Francisco, Calif) and gefitinib (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del). Currently, cetuximab is the only EGFRI
approved in combination with radiotherapy for the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer.2
Although the pivotal trial2 did not result in
increased high-grade dermatologic toxicities, widespread
use has yielded anecdotal reports suggesting a greater incidence and severity of these untoward events.3-8 The
inability to demonstrate increased toxicity in the randomized trial can be attributed to a study design that was not
powered adequately to determine the effect on toxicities
of adding cetuximab to radiation; because radiation dermatitis occurred in 90% of control patients; the use of a
grading system that has not been standardized for the
novel combination of EGFRIs with radiotherapy; and
confounding factors, such as the coexisting papulopustular rash, which may have been more significant clinically
because of its high frequency (87% of patients) and the
involvement of both radiated and neighboring sites (ie,
face, neck, and upper trunk). Knowledge of the dermatoCancer

logic toxicities and treatment of these reactions is critical
for the ability to maintain the dose intensity of these regimens. In this article, we explore high-grade dermatologic
toxicities in patients with malignancies who were treated
with EGFRIs and radiotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analyzed Studies
Clinical trials were screened from the PubMed MEDLINE database (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda,
Md), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane
Controlled Trials Register, and abstracts from the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology
(available at: http://www.astro.org) and the American
Society of Clinical Oncology (available at: http://www.
asco.org) websites; information was obtained on or before
January 30, 2008. By using these predefined limits, 75 trials were screened, and 24 met the criteria of investigating
combined radiation with an EGFRI with or without cytotoxic chemotherapy, comprising 933 patients (221 study
control patients did not receive an EGFRI). These trials
are summarized in Table 1. Of these, 16 phase 2/3 clinical
trials were included in the pooled analysis, because they
included data on high-grade (grades 3-4 according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.
version 2.0 or the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events, version 3.0)30 radiation dermatitis, papulopustular rash, or mucositis. Some studies used the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system. In
addition, 8 phase 1 trials were included in which the
EGFRI was administered at or below the doses indicated
in other malignancies for which they have been registered
(cetuximab, 400 mg/m2 loading dose and 250 mg/m2
thereafter; erlotinib, 150 mg daily; gefitnib, 250 mg
daily; panitumumab, 2.5 mg/kg weekly). Full descriptions of the inclusion criteria, drug schedules, and relevant
endpoints for each study have been described previously
in referenced publications. The majority of patients had
cancer of the head and neck, comprising 14 of 24 clinical
trials analyzed. Other trials investigated rectal cancer (3
trials), esophageal cancer (1 trial), cervical cancer (1 trial),
pancreatic cancer (2 trials), and nonsmall cell lung cancer
(3 trials). The EGFRIs that were used in combination

with radiation included cetuximab (16 trials), erlotinib (6
trials), panitumumab (1 trial), and gefitinib (1 trial).
The reporting of high-grade dermatologic toxicities
varied. Of 14 head and neck cancer trials, 6 trials reported
on high-grade dermatitis because of radiation (n ¼ 316
patients). Seven of the 14 trials also reported on highgrade skin toxicities other than radiation (hereafter
referred to as rash), and these were reported as ‘dermatitis,’ ‘skin rash,’ and ‘acneform rash’ (n ¼ 207 patients).
Only 1 of the 10 nonhead and neck cancer trials reported
radiation dermatitis (n ¼ 9 patients), and 4 trials
accounted for rash (n ¼ 69 patients). High-grade mucositis was reported in 9 head and neck cancer trials (n ¼ 488
patients) and in 1 nonhead and neck cancer trial (n ¼ 40
patients). For controls, multi-institutional, phase 3 radiation and chemoradiation trials and control arms from
EGFRI trials that reported high-grade radiation dermatitis (n ¼ 711 patients), rash (n ¼ 1238 patients), or mucositis (n ¼ 1736 patients) were included in the analysis.

Statistical Analysis
Analysis was performed using version 2 of the Comprehensive MetaAnalysis program (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). The
number of patients with high-grade dermatologic toxicities
and the number of those patients receiving EGFRIs were
extracted from the selected clinical trials. For each study, the
proportion of patients with dermatologic toxicities was calculated, and the exact 95% confidence interval (95% CI)
was derived. For studies that did not use EGFRIs, the incidence of dermatologic toxicities also was calculated and compared. In addition, relative risk of radiotherapy plus EGFRI
versus radiation alone also was determined to assess the effect
of EGFRIs on dermatologic toxicities.
For meta-analyses, both a fixed-effects model
(weighted with inverse variance) and a random-effects
model were considered. For each meta-analysis, the Cochran Q statistic was calculated first to assess the heterogeneity among the proportions of the included trials.31,32 If P
values for the Cochran Q statistic were <.1, then the
assumption of homogeneity was deemed invalid, and the
random-effects model was reported after exploring
the causes of heterogeneity. Otherwise, results from both
the fixed-effects model and the random-effects model
were reported. A 2-tailed P value <.05 was considered
statistically significant.

receiving cetuximab either combined with paclitaxel and
cisplatin (incidence, 18%; 95% CI, 7%-38.9%)10 or as
single agent (n ¼ 27 patients; incidence, 11%; 95% CI,
3.6%-29.2%).13
Rash (acneform rash, skin rash, and dermatitis)

The incidence of high-grade (grade 3-4) rash ranged
between 0.8% and 41.1%, and the summary incidence
was 16.1% (95% CI, 12.8%-20.1%) (Fig. 1A). All
patients were treated for HNSCC (n ¼ 818). The highest
incidence was observed in patients (n ¼ 25) who were
receiving erlotinib plus cisplatin (incidence, 28%; 95%

in patients (n ¼ 16) who were receiving cetuximab with
docetaxel/cisplatin (incidence, 6%; 95% CI, 0.8%33.4%).9
Mucositis

The incidence of high-grade (grade 3-4) mucositis
ranged between 1.9% and 94.2%, and the summary incidence was 47.4% (95% CI, 34%-61.2%) (Fig. 1A). All

Phase 3 trials that included 1 arm of daily standard
fractionation radiation were included for comparison (Table 2). Radiation-induced dermatitis was reported in 1
trial36 of radiotherapy alone (n ¼ 171 patients), concurrently with cisplatin (n ¼ 171 patients), or preceded by 5flurouracil/cisplatin (n ¼ 156 patients). In addition, the
radiotherapy arm (n ¼ 212 patients) of the phase 3 cetuximab plus radiation trial was included for a total of 383
radiotherapy patients and 327 chemoradiotherapy
patients.
The incidence of high-grade (grade 3-4) radiation
dermatitis ranged between 5.5% and 23.8%, and the
summary incidence was 13.1% (95% CI, 6.5%-24.8%)
(Fig. 1B). All patients were treated for HNSCC
(n ¼ 383). The highest incidence was observed in the radiation only arm of the trial (n ¼ 212 patients) that used
cetuximab plus radiation (incidence, 18%; 95% CI,

in the chemoradiation trial in the radiation alone arm
(incidence, 9%; 95% CI, 5.5%-14.3%).
Rash (acneform rash, skin rash, and dermatitis)

The incidence of high-grade (grade 3-4) rash ranged
between 0.3% and 27%, and the summary incidence was
5.2% (95% CI, 1.5%-16.8%) (Fig. 1B). All patients were
treated for HNSCC (n ¼ 683). The highest incidence was
observed in the radiation arm (n ¼ 210) of a phase 3 trial
(incidence, 21%; (95% CI, 16%-27.0%),34 and the lowest incidence was observed in the control arm of the cetuximab plus radiation trial (n ¼ 208; incidence, 1%; 95%
CI, 0.3%-3.8%).
Mucositis

The incidence of high-grade (grade 3-4) mucositis
ranged between 0.2% and 58.6%, and the summary incidence was 26.9% (95% CI, 15.9%-41.8%) (Fig. 1B). All
patients were treated for HNSCC (n ¼ 858). The highest
incidence was observed in patients of the cetuximab plus
radiation trial (n ¼ 212; incidence, 52%; 95% CI,
45.3%-58.6%),2 and the lowest incidence was observed
in the radiation arm of the trial reported by Bernier et al
(incidence, 1%; 95% CI, 0.2%-4.4%).35

The Relative Risk of Developing
Dermatologic Toxicities to Radiation
Plus Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor Inhibitors
The contribution of an EGFRIs to the development of
dermatologic toxicities in patients who receive radiotherapy can be determined by the calculation of relative risk
(RR). The RR was determined by comparing to clinical
trials that reported high-grade radiation dermatitis (2 trials), rash (5 trials), and mucositis (5 trials) in patients who
received radiation alone. The RR of high-grade radiation
dermatitis for radiation plus EGFRI versus control was
2.39 (95% CI, 1.8-3.2; P < .001), the RR for high-grade
rash with an EGFRI was 3.1 (95% CI, 2.1-4.6; P < .001),
and the RR of high-grade mucositis with the addition of
an EGFRI was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.5-2; P < .001). In summary, EGFRIs were associated with an increased risk for
developing radiation dermatitis, rash, and mucositis
(Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
There is abundant clinical data demonstrating that EGFRIs without radiotherapy result in various dermatologic
toxicities, most notably a papulopustular rash in 75% to
90% of patients. Similarly, there is long-standing evidence
of the toxic effects of radiotherapy in skin, manifested
clinically by radiation dermatitis and necrosis with various
levels of severity. Although they may be expected given
the radiosensitizing properties of EGFRIs, there has been
no clear demonstration of increased dermatologic toxicities when these agents are administered concurrently with
radiation. Although a significant increase in the incidence
of high-grade toxicity was not demonstrated in the phase
3 trial (23% in the cetuximab plus radiotherapy arm vs
18% in the radiotherapy-alone arm), a slight increase in
the median duration of radiation dermatitis in the cetuximab arm (11.1 weeks) was noted compared with the
radiotherapy-alone arm (9.4 weeks).39 Our data indicate
that, compared with radiotherapy, the addition of an
EGFRI leads to an increased risk of dermatologic toxicities, including radiation dermatitis, rash, and mucositis.
Our findings are limited by the retrospective nature
of the analysis and the low attention to dermatologic toxicities, exemplified by the absence of their reporting in
76% of EGFRI plus radiotherapy trials. These

observations underscore the need for prospective evaluation of patients on combined regimens with greater attention to dermatologic adverse events. Similar to trials in
patients with colorectal cancer who received EGFRIs, in
which prospective evaluation40 has demonstrated differences in the rates of nonrash dermatologic toxicities compared with retrospective analyses in oncology trials, it is
likely that dermatologic toxicity rates will vary in this
patient population. Therefore, studies that prospectively
evaluate dermatologic toxicities in patients who receive
EGFRIs plus radiation are critical for the estimation of
true incidence and correlative factors that may affect their
development. Moreover, despite the heterogeneity of
included trials, meta-analyses using fixed-effects models
reported summary incidence rates in a large group of
patients who received EGFRIs/radiotherapy (n ¼ 1156)
versus radiotherapy alone (n ¼ 3685) that, when compared, indicated a significantly increased risk of highgrade radiation dermatitis (RR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.8-3.2; P
< .001), rash (RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.1-4.6; P < .001), and
mucositis (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2; P < .001). Taken as a
whole, the calculation of RR may minimize confounding
factors and suggests a specific contribution by EGFRIs to
the development of high-grade dermatologic toxicities in
combined radiotherapy regimens.
Although a greater therapeutic index is the objective
of EGFRI plus radiotherapy regimens, recent anecdotal
reports suggest an increased severity of radiation dermatitis in patients who receive EFGRIs with radiotherapy.4
The first 2 cases that highlighted greater dermatologic toxicity included 2 of 5 patients with head and neck cancer at
a single institution who were treated with 3-dimensional
1296

conformal radiotherapy in 2-gray (Gy) daily fractions
with concurrent cetuximab. After the administration of
58 Gy and 5 cetuximab infusions, both patients developed
a grade 4 necrotic skin reaction. A skin biopsy revealed
complete epidermal loss with subepidermal blistering and
a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.4 It is noteworthy that
these 2 patients had received prior radiotherapy that did
not lead to high-grade toxicities. An additional case series
of 14 patients with head and neck cancer reported that 5
patients (36%) developed high-grade radiation dermatitis,
and 1 patient developed high-grade mucositis. Moreover,
10 of those patients (71%) developed staphylococcal
infections, which complicated the radiation dermatitis.5
Details of a more confluent appearance of the EGFRIinduced papulopustular rash also have been reported
within the radiation field with the use of cetuximab37 and
erlotinib,6 demonstrating the synergistic effect of EGFR
inhibition and radiotherapy on toxicity.
The mechanisms underlying increased dermatotoxic
effects of ionizing radiation with EGFRIs can be attributed to events similar to those leading to radiosensitization in tumors.1 As with malignant cells, the exposure of
keratinocytes to ionizing radiation results in EGFR upregulation, which enhances cellular DNA-damage repair
capability, mitigating the toxicity of radiation. Radiation
also will lead to EGFR translocation into the nucleus and
increased DNA-protein kinase activity. Blockade of the
EGFR in keratinocytes leads to decreased receptor import,
DNA repair, cell survival, and cell migration, all of which
have deleterious effects on normal cell functioning.38 In
summary, it is likely that EGFRI-induced radiosensitization, with decreased repopulation and cell survival, occurs
in both malignant and benign tissues, explaining the
greater toxicity in EGFR-bearing tissues.
An increased risk of rash and mucositis also was
demonstrated in trials that used EGFRIs with radiotherapy. Mucositis is infrequent with the use of EGFRIs
alone (range, 8%-10% of treated patients) but is common
with radiation (range, 24%-52%).38,39 Despite the low
toxicity of EGFRIs on mucosae, this added effect must be
taken into consideration in future trials and in patient
care given the high rates of mucositis with radiotherapy
alone.
Dermatologic toxicities to EGFRIs have a significant effect on quality of life.41 Although quality of life was
maintained in patients who received cetuximab plus
Cancer

radiotherapy, it must be noted that the questionnaires
used for assessment in these patients did not specifically
address dermatologic events to EGFRIs.42
Our data suggest that there is an urgent need for
improved detection and management strategies of dermatologic toxicities in patients who are treated with EGFRIs
plus radiotherapy. Randomized trials have demonstrated
benefit with the prophylactic use of minocycline and tetracycline for EGFRI-induced rash.43,44 The novel resulting effects of radiation and EGFR inhibition dictate
specificity with regard to grading systems, reporting, and
supportive care regimens. Until a better understanding of
these events emerges, it is critical for caregivers to provide
adequate counseling, observation, and early intervention
in patients who are treated with EGFRIs and radiotherapy
to maintain their quality of life and to maximize their clinical outcome.
