BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term survival and late toxicities of concurrent-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III through IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) from endemic regions of China. METHODS: Patients
with stage III to IVB NPC were assigned randomly to receive radiotherapy (RT) alone (the RT group) or RT plus concurrent adjuvant
chemotherapy (the CRT group). CRT patients received concurrent cisplatin (40 mg/m2) weekly during RT followed by cisplatin (80
mg/m2) and fluorouracil (800 mg/m2 daily for 5 days) every 4 weeks for 3 cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival.
RESULTS: In total, 316 patients underwent randomization, with 158 to each group. At a median follow-up of 70 months, the 5-year
overall survival rate was 72% for the CRT group and 62% for the RT group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.99;
P 5.043). Failure-free survival was significantly higher in the CRT group (P 5.020). Most late toxicities were similar (33% vs 26%;
P 5.089), except for cranial neuropathy (P 5.042), peripheral neuropathy (P 5.041), and ear damage (P 5.048), which were significantly increased in the CRT group. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy to RT provides survival benefits to patients with stage III through IVB NPC in endemic regions of China, and it does not increase most late toxicities apart from

INTRODUCTION
Radiotherapy (RT) is the primary treatment approach for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and the outcome for patients
with early stage disease is usually favorable; however, the response of locoregionally advanced NPC is unsatisfactory.1
Since 1998, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has recommended RT with concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy for locoregionally advanced NPC based on the landmark Intergroup 00-99 Study (IGS), which was the first randomized trial to achieve a 31% improvement in the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate by adding concurrent cisplatin followed
by adjuvant cisplatin and fluorouracil to RT.2,3
Although those results were impressive, there were controversies regarding the applicability of the results to the
endemic form of NPC. The survival rate of the IGS RT-alone group was worse than the survival rates routinely achieved
in other comparable cancer centers (5-year OS rates, 37% vs 58%).3,4 Approximately 25% of IGS patients had keratinizing NPC, whereas >95% of patients in endemic areas have nonkeratinizing NPC, and the prognosis for each histologic

subtype is different.5 Surprisingly, 2 randomized trials
that were conducted to verify the IGS regimen in endemic
NPC patients resulted in opposite outcomes: results from
the SQNP01 trial in Singapore indicated that the modified IGS regimen significantly improved 5-year OS compared with RT (67% vs 49%; P 5 .008),6,7 whereas the
HK99-01 trial in Hong Kong did not (68% vs 64%;
P 5 .22).8,9
Therefore, we carried out a randomized trial to verify
a modified IGS regimen in patients with stage III to IVB
NPC from endemic regions of China. The preliminary
results have been published and demonstrate that concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy increases 2-year OS by 10%
(P 5 .003).10 The purpose of this report is to verify the
long-term survival and late toxicities and to further evaluate
the ultimate therapeutic benefit of a modified IGS regimen
in patients with advanced NPC from endemic regions.

using sealed envelopes through the Clinical Trials Center,
Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, to receive either
concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy (CRT) or RT alone. The randomization code was
developed using a computerized random number generator. The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints
included failure-free survival (FFS), distant failure-free
survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS), actuarial rates of death from disease progression and
death from treatment-related toxicities or incidental
causes, and crude incidence rates of toxicities. We also
added progression-free survival (PFS) as an ad hoc secondary endpoint. The investigators who assessed treatment
outcome were blinded to the patient’s group assignment.
Treatment

The initial examination included a medical history,
physical examination, complete blood cell count, full biochemical profile, and electrocardiogram. All patients
underwent nasopharyngeal fiber optic endoscopy and
biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or intensive computed tomography (CT) scan of the nasopharynx
and the neck. Metastatic workup included a chest x-ray
and liver ultrasound; bone scans were obtained from
patients with bone pain, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, or N2/N3 disease.

All enrolled patients received a 2-gray (Gy) fraction 5
times weekly as conventional, 2-dimensional RT (2DRT). The cumulative doses were >66 Gy to the gross
tumor, 60 to 66 Gy to the involved areas of the neck, and
>50 Gy to uninvolved areas. Details of the RT technique
have been reported previously.10,12
For the CRT group, concurrent chemotherapy with
weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2 on day 1) was received intravenously for 7 weeks during RT. Three subsequent adjuvant
chemotherapy cycles, consisting of cisplatin (80 mg/m2
intravenously) on day 1 and fluorouracil (800 mg/m2 daily
as an intravenous, 120-hour infusion) on days 1 through 5,
were administered on days 29 through 33, 57 through 61,
and days 85 through 89 after the completion of RT.
Dose modifications were not permitted during concurrent chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy dose modifications were based on nadir blood counts and interim toxicities
of the preceding cycle. If the absolute neutrophil count was
from >1000 to <1500/lL, the platelet count was from
>50,000 to <75,000/lL, or the creatinine clearance was
from >40 to <60 mL per minute, then the cisplatin dose
was decreased to 60 mg/m2. If the absolute neutrophil count
was <1000/lL, the platelet count was <50,000/lL, or the
creatinine clearance was <40 mL per minute, then chemotherapy was withheld. The dose of fluorouracil was decreased
by 200 mg/m2 for grade 2 mucositis and by 400 mg/m2 for
grade 3 mucositis. Whenever possible, patients received salvage treatments, including reirradiation, chemotherapy, and
surgery, after a documented relapse or persistent disease
developed, according to institutional guidelines.

eligible. Key inclusion criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group system (ECOG) performance
status between 0 and 2 and adequate bone marrow, liver,
and renal function. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy
or lactation, a history of renal disease, unstable cardiac disease requiring treatment, any previous chemotherapy or
radiotherapy, and prior malignancy. The protocol was
reviewed and approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all patients were required to provide written
informed consent before participation.

6 months thereafter. All local recurrences were diagnosed
by fiber optic endoscopy and biopsy or on MRI/intensive
CT studies of the nasopharynx and the skull base. Regional recurrences were diagnosed by clinical examination
of the neck; irresolute cases were confirmed by fine-needle
aspiration or MRI/intensive CT scans. Distant metastases
were diagnosed by clinical symptoms, physical examinations, and imaging methods, including chest x-ray, bone
scan, MRI, CT, and abdominal sonography.
Chemotherapy-related toxicities were graded using
the World Health Organization grading scale.13 Acute
and late RT-related toxicities were graded according to
the Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria of the Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group.14 Late toxicities were defined
as symptoms that occurred or persisted beyond 90 days
from the commencement of RT.
Statistical Analysis

Our study had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR)
of 0.56 for OS (2-sided log-rank test; P 5 .05), assuming
a 5-year OS rate of 75% in the CRT group and 60% in
the RT group.12,15 We anticipated that 127 events would
be required from 272 patients (136 per treatment group);
therefore, a maximum of 143 patients per group (total
286) were to be recruited assuming a 5% rate of early
dropout or loss to follow-up.
We had 1 protocol-specified interim analysis of OS
when approximately 50% of events had been observed
(63 deaths occurred; December 2006), and the results
have been published.10 The boundaries were computed
using the Lan-DeMets alpha and beta spending function
approach to an O’Brien-Fleming type boundary to preserve an overall 0.05 type I error rate. Using this method,
P < .003 was the significance threshold for stopping the
trial early at the interim analysis, and P < .049 was the significance threshold for the final analysis.
OS was calculated from the date of random assignment to the date of death from any cause; FFS was calculated to the date of first failure at any site; PFS was
calculated to the date of failure or death from any cause,
whichever occurred first; and LR-FFS and D-FFS were
calculated to the date of first locoregional or remote failure, respectively. Time-to-event data were described using
Kaplan-Meier curves, time-to-event intervals were compared between groups using the log-rank test, and HRs
were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model.
Multivariate analyses with the Cox proportional hazards
model were used to test the independent significance of
different factors. The following parameters were included
in the model as the covariates for each analysis: sex, age

(<50 years vs 50 years), TNM stage (III vs IVA-IVB),
staging method (MRI vs CT), RT period interruption, (0
day vs 1 day), boosting, (no vs yes), and treatment arm
(RT vs CRT). The initial response rates, toxicity rates,
and other categorical variables were compared using the
chi-square test (or the Fisher exact test, if indicated). A 2sided level of significance of .05 was applied to all tests.
Efficacy analyses were conducted in the intentionto-treat population. Only patients who received their randomly assigned treatment were included in the analyses of
adverse events.
RESULTS
PATIENT POPULATION
Between July 2002 and September 2005, 316 eligible
patients were randomly assigned, with 158 patients in
each group. In total, 95% of patients received regular follow-up until death or the latest scheduled assessment (Fig.
1). The last follow-up was February 25, 2011, and the median follow-up for the entire cohort was 70 months
(range, 1-102 months). The 2 treatment groups were well
balanced with respect to patient characteristics and tumor
factors (Table 1).
Treatment Exposure

In total, 99.4% CRT patients and 98.1% RT patients
completed all scheduled RT doses (P 5 .623). During the
concurrent phase, 68% patients in the CRT group completed all 7 cycles (mean, 6.5 6 1.3 cycles). Reduced concurrent chemotherapy cycles were mostly because of
leukopenia (75%; 38 of 51 patients). During the adjuvant
phase, 61% completed all 3 cycles (mean, 2.0 6 1.3
cycles). Patient refusal accounted for the primary cause of
uncompleted adjuvant chemotherapy (33 of 61 patients;
54%). The mean total cisplatin and fluorouracil doses
were 420 mg/m2 and 8000 mg/m2, respectively (81% and
67% of scheduled doses, respectively). Details of the
patients who completed the assigned treatment and the
major protocol violations are provided in Figure 1.
Efficacy

Within the median follow-up of 70 months, 110 patients
experienced treatment failure, including 47 of 158
patients (30%) in the CRT group and 63 of 158 patients
(40%) in the RT group. In total, 117 patients died,
including 52 of 158 patients (33%) in the CRT group
and 65 of 158 patients (41%) in the RT group (Fig. 1).
Most first failures occurred at distant sites, with distant
failures observed in 33 of 158 patients (21%) in the CRT

Locoregional failures occurred in 15 of 158 patients

4 of 77 patients (5%) had concomitant locoregional
relapse.

The 5-year OS rates of 72% in the CRT group and
62% in the RT group were significantly different (HR,
0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.99; P 5 .043)
(Table 2, Fig. 2A). The 5-year FFS and PFS rates also differed significantly (72% vs 62%; P 5 .020 [Table 2, Fig.

respectively); however, the 5-year D-FFS and LR-FFS
rates did not differ significantly (Table 2, Fig. 2D,E).
The CRT group had a significant reduction in the
5-year actuarial rate of death from disease progression
compared with the RT group (24% vs 34%; HR, 0.67;
95% CI, 0.45-0.99; P 5 .043); whereas the 5-year
actuarial rates of death from treatment-related toxicities
or incidental causes were similar in both groups (5% vs
3%, respectively; HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.39-3.21;

patients (2%) died from chronic lung disease, 3 (1%)
died from cardiovascular disease, 2 (1%) died from cerebral vascular incidents, 2 (1%) died from secondary
malignancies, and 1 died (0.3%) from suicide. In the
multivariate analysis (Table 3), treatment arm was a significant predictive factor for OS (P 5 .045), FFS
(P 5 .012), PFS (P 5 .014), and D-FFS (P 5 .047), but

Adverse Events

In total, 150 of 315 patients (48%) developed 1 or more
acute grade 3 or greater toxicities, including 99 of 157
patients (63%) in the CRT group and 51 of 158 patients
(32%) in the RT group (P < .001) (Table 4). There was 1
treatment-related death in the CRT group because of epilepsy. The incidence of RT-related mucositis, vomiting,
leukopenia, and depleted platelet counts was significantly
greater in the CRT group (Table 4).
Overall, 93 of 315 patients (30%) developed 1 or
more late grade 3 or 4 toxicities, including 52 of 157
patients (33%) in the CRT group and 41 of 158 patients
(26%) in the RT group (P 5 .089) (Table 4). No deaths
caused by late toxicities were observed in either group.
The incidence of cranial neuropathy (10% vs 4%;
P 5 .042), peripheral neuropathy (2% vs 0%; P 5 .041),
and ear damage (28% vs 17% P 5 .048), including deafness and otitis, was significantly greater in the CRT group;
other late toxicities were not significantly different.

DISCUSSION
In this trial, CRT significantly improved 5-year OS, similar
to the SQNP01 trial6,7 and in contrast to the HK99-01
trial.8,9 Both the SQNP01 trial and the current trial enrolled patients who had stage III to IVB patients according

to the 5th edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual,
whereas the HK99-01 trial focused on patients with N2
or N3 disease. Patients who have regionally advanced
NPC have a higher distant tumor burden and, thus,
poorer OS compared with patients who have locally
advanced disease.1 Almost all patients in the SQNP01
trial and in the current trial received 2-DRT, whereas 50%
patients in the HK99-01 trial opted for either 3-dimensional
conformal radiation therapy or intensity-modulated radioCancer

therapy. These conformal techniques may provide better
local control, thus reducing the additional advantages of
chemotherapy.16 Finally, in the current trial, we observed no
differences in the actuarial rates of noncancer death in the
CRT and RT groups, whereas results from HK99-01 trial
indicated that the combined regimen lead to significantly
more noncancer deaths, thereby narrowing any resultant
gain in OS because of increased incidental or chemotherapyrelated toxicity deaths.

Only results of treatment arm (RT vs CRT) and other statistically significant
variables are presented.

The differences in deaths from incidental causes
between the current trial and the HK99-01 trial may be
because, for this trial, we adopted a modified IGS regimen.
Instead of high-dose cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks
during RT, we used concurrent, weekly (40 mg/m2) cisplatin chemotherapy. High doses every 3 weeks were the most
favorable treatment option for distant metastases but
resulted in acute, severe toxicity.8 Chan et al compared RT
alone with chemotherapy (40 mg/m2) weekly during the
RT phase, and their results indicated that the regimen of
concurrent weekly chemotherapy was a promising standard
treatment strategy for patients with locoregionally
advanced NPC.17,18 The scheduled adjuvant chemotherapy dose intensity also was moderately reduced (cisplatin
80 mg/m2 plus fluorouracil 800 mg/m2 daily), because
many Asian patients cannot tolerate the full chemotherapy
dose of the IGS regimen. The mean total doses of cisplatin
and fluorouracil delivered in this trial were 420 mg/m2 and
8000 mg/m2, respectively, which were comparatively less
aggressive than the respective 444 mg/m2 and 9099 mg/m2
doses in the HK99-01 trial.
The current trial demonstrated improved 5-year
FFS and PFS rates in the CRT group, similar to the
HK99-01 cohort, related to the eradication of micrometastases and the enhanced local effects of RT from using
concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy. We observed an 8%
improvement in the 5-year D-FFS rate, which was almost
statistically significant (P 5 .058), similar to the reduced
distant metastasis observed in the SQNP01 trial (17% vs
37%; P 5 .001). Conversely, this trial demonstrated that
concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve LRFFS, which may be explained in part by the good locoregional control provided by RT in our center, as also demonstrated in other studies.1,16 In this progress report, the
results for LR-FFS and, to a lesser degree, for D-FFS did

not confirm our preliminary results; in our first report,
the P value for LR-FFS was .007 (it is now .11), and the P
value for D-FFS was .024 (it is now .058).10 The LR-FFS
rates improved significantly during the first 2 years and
then were almost identical in both groups. However, the
CIs for 2 HRs for LR-FFS from preliminary and longterm results overlap (LR-FFS: preliminary results: HR,
0.25 [95% CI, 0.08-0.75]; long-term results: HR, 0.59
[95% CI, 0.31-1.14]), indicating that there are no significant differences between preliminary and long-term
results. A similar situation was observed in the results for
D-FFS. Otherwise, a hypothesis that accounts for the difference is that the addition of chemotherapy was probably
not effective enough in eradicating residual tumor cells
and micrometastases over RT, but it may prolong the latency for relapse.
No significant differences in late toxicities of grade 3
or 4 were observed between the 2 groups, and there were
no deaths from late toxicity in either group. The rate of
peripheral neuropathy in our study was significantly
increased in the CRT group (P 5 .041), which was consistent with the HK99-01 study; however, cranial neuropathy also was significantly increased (P 5 .042), which
differed from the HK99-01 results.9 This difference may

be attributed to the accumulation of cisplatin in the nervous system, particularly the dorsal root ganglia, which can
result in neurotoxicity.19 Furthermore, ear damage,
including deafness and otitis, was increased in the CRT
group (P 5 .048), which may have been caused by the cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Concurrent chemotherapy
can further reduce the radiation tolerance of cochlea,
which have received high radiation dose after 2-DRT,
thereby leading to sensorineural hearing loss.20 Moreover,
large doses of cisplatin can induce hearing damage.21
In recent years, 3 phase 3 randomized trials comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy with RT alone have
confirmed that the addition of concurrent chemotherapy
to RT enhances the survival of patients with advanced
NPC.17,18,22,23 Furthermore, meta-analyses have demonstrated that chemotherapy administered concomitantly
with RT provides a survival benefit.24,25 Unfortunately,
the role of adjuvant chemotherapy was not specifically
addressed in those analyses. It is unclear whether the survival benefits of the modified IGS regimen in the current
were because of concurrent chemotherapy or adjuvant
chemotherapy. Therefore, our team conducted a multicenter randomized trial to assess the contribution of adjuvant chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy
versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00677118). The immediate
results of that study indicate that adjuvant cisplatin and
fluorouracil chemotherapy may add little survival benefit
to concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.26 Building on these data, it
seems that most of the benefit of the modified IGS regimen was derived from concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
However, the modest dose of cisplatin received during
RT may not be adequate to maximize the benefit of
chemotherapy in patients with NPC who have a high risk
of disease recurrence, and the rate of distant and local failure may be further reduced by adding new and more intensive combinations of neoadjuvant or adjuvant
chemotherapy.
In conclusion, concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus
adjuvant chemotherapy provides significant survival benefits over RT alone in patients with stage III to IVB NPC
from endemic regions of China. Combined treatment
induces more acute toxicities but does not increase late
toxicities, apart from cranial neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and ear damage.
