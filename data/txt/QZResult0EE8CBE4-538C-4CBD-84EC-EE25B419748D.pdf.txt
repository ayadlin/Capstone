ABSTRACT
Despite increasingly successful treatment of pediatric ALL, up to 20% of patients
encounter relapse. By current biomarkers, the majority of relapse patients is initially
not identified indicating the need for prognostic and therapeutic targets reflecting
leukemia biology. We previously described that rapid engraftment of patient ALL cells
transplanted onto NOD/SCID mice (short time to leukemia, TTLshort) is indicative of
early patient relapse. Gene expression profiling identified genes coding for molecules
involved in mTOR signaling to be associated with TTLshort/early relapse leukemia.
Here, we now functionally address mTOR signaling activity in primograft ALL
samples and evaluate mTOR pathway inhibition as novel treatment strategy for highrisk ALL ex vivo and in vivo. By analysis of S6-phosphorylation downstream of mTOR,
increased mTOR activation was found in TTLshort/high-risk ALL, which was effectively
abrogated by mTOR inhibitors resulting in decreased leukemia proliferation and
growth. In a preclinical setting treating individual patient-derived ALL in vivo, mTOR
inhibition alone, and even more pronounced together with conventional remission
induction therapy, significantly delayed post-treatment leukemia reoccurrence in
TTLshort/high-risk ALL.
Thus, the TTLshort phenotype is functionally characterized by hyperactivated
mTOR signaling and can effectively be targeted ex vivo and in vivo providing a novel
therapeutic strategy for high-risk ALL.

INTRODUCTION

in about 20% of patients resulting in relapse associated
with inferior prognosis, especially if the disease reoccurs
at early time points [2]. However, the majority of patients
encountering relapse are not identified by currently
established prognostic markers including detection of
minimal residual disease (MRD), but are initially stratified
into standard- or intermediate risk groups [3, 4]. These
limitations clearly highlight the need for additional
treatment modalities including improved risk stratification
and novel therapies directed against identified targets.
Analysis of primary ALL cells is restricted since
they are of limited availability and cannot be sufficiently

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most
frequently diagnosed malignancy among children and
adolescents. Over the last decades, treatment has become
increasingly successful leading to five-year event-free
survival rates of more than 80%. This success is based
on the use of risk adapted multi-agent chemotherapy
protocols in which patients are assigned to therapy
regimens with different intensities according to the
individual probability to relapse [1]. Despite these major
achievements in treatment of pediatric ALL, therapy fails

cultured in vitro. Xenotransplantation of human leukemia
cells onto immunodeficient mice leads to disease
manifestation recapitulating the human leukemia in the
recipient animals thereby allowing functional analysis of
primary leukemia cells but also preclinical evaluation of
novel therapies in vivo [5].
Previously, we investigated engraftment properties
in a series of primary patient ALL samples transplanted
onto NOD/SCID mice and described that a short time
to leukemia manifestation in the recipient animals (time
to leukemia short, TTLshort) is associated with poor
patient outcome and of strong impact for early relapse
prognostication. Importantly, this engraftment phenotype
is characterized by a specific gene expression profile
including genes coding for regulators of cellular growth
and proliferation. In particular, this signature shows low
gene expression of molecules inhibiting mTOR and high
transcript levels of mTOR activators suggesting increased
mTOR signaling activity in this high-risk ALL subgroup
[6].
In this study we now investigate the functional
activity of this key survival pathway and evaluate mTOR
as a molecular target for directed therapy in high-risk
leukemia ex vivo and in a preclinical model setting in vivo.

The TTL signature is associated with mTOR
signaling and inhibition
We re-interrogated our previously obtained gene
expression data set [6] and employed analysis tools
assessing similarities of the TTL profile with gene sets
annotated to different pathways or treatment-specific
expression profiles (gene set enrichment and connectivity
map analysis). By gene set enrichment analysis we
investigated associations of the TTL profile with pathwayannotated gene sets (189 gene sets, Molecular Signature
Database, C6: oncogenic signatures; http://www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb). Interestingly, a significant
association (FDR q-value ≤ .01) was identified for two
mTOR-annotated gene sets, highlighting the impact of
mTOR signaling on NOD/SCID/huALL engraftment
and patient outcome (FIGURE 1A, SUPPLEMENTARY
TABLE ST1). In addition, we used a chemical genomics
approach and analyzed similarities of the TTL signature
with genome wide expression profiles obtained
from human cancer cells lines treated with different
bioactive molecules (connectivity map analysis). Most
interestingly, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (sirolimus)
and LY294002, an early synthetic PI3K inhibitor which is
also active against mTOR, were identified with a negative
connectivity score indicating their potential to revert the
TTLshort phenotype (FIGURE 1B, SUPPLEMENTARY

Thus, these findings emphasize that mTOR signaling

a gene coding for the thymic stromal lymphopoetin
receptor (TSLPR), which regulates proliferation of
hematopoietic cells by signaling via JAK/STAT and
PI3K/mTOR pathways [7]. Alterations in CRLF2, i.e.
P2RY8/CRLF2 or IGH@/CRLF2 gene fusions, point
mutations (CRLF2F232C) and Janus kinase 2 mutations
(JAK2R683G) are frequently associated with CRLF2
overexpression, an expression profile similar to Ph+-ALL
(“Ph- or BCR/ABL-like”), and involve aberrant PI3K/
mTOR signaling [8-13]. Importantly, all 14 samples
analyzed in this study did not harbor CRLF2 or JAK2
gene alterations and did not show high CRLF2 transcript
or TSLPR protein expression. In addition, we investigated
alterations of IKZF1, a gene coding for the lymphoid
transcription factor IKAROS and identified two TTLshort
samples with IKFZ1 deletions (TABLE 1).

Fourteen B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL xenograft

associated with inferior patient outcome in contrast to
relapse-free survival of leukemias with a long engraftment
phenotype also in this patient sample group, as previously
observed (SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE SF1). TTL
phenotypes were not associated with prognostic leukemia
characteristics and subgroups, all samples were BCR/ABL
negative, one TTLshort leukemia carried a MLL/AF4 and
one TTLlong an ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion. Additionally,

PI3K/mTOR signaling in TTLshort and TTLlong
ALL

mTOR hyperactivity in TTLshort ALL is effectively
inhibited ex vivo

Based on our data pointing to critical involvement
of mTOR signaling in TTLshort/high-risk leukemia, we
addressed mTOR pathway activity by investigating
phosphorylation of key signaling molecules: ribosomal
protein S6 (S6), a downstream molecule which is
phosphorylated by the ribosomal protein S6 kinase
(p70S6K1) upon mTOR activation; and AKT, an upstream
signaling kinase that is activated by phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) also mediating mTOR activation.
Phosphorylated S6 (pS6) and AKT (pAKT) were assessed
by phosphoflow cytometry in primary leukemia cells
isolated from ALL bearing recipients. Interestingly,
different levels of constitutive pS6 were detected with
higher S6 activation in TTLshort compared to lower activity
in TTLlong leukemias (FIGURE 2 A, B). To validate our
results obtained by flow cytometry, phosphorylation of
signaling molecules was also assessed by western blot
analysis showing significant stronger pS6 signals in
TTLshort leukemias (SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE SF2A,
B). However, no differences in pAKT were observed
in TTL subgroups as analyzed by flow cytometry
(FIGURE 2C, D), concordant with no constitutive AKT
phosphorylation (T308 and S473) analyzed by western
blot in both TTLshort and TTLlong leukemia samples
(SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE SF2A). With this, the
cytometry results are confirmed by western blot analysis
validating this method for further analysis of pS6 and
pAKT.
In addition to constitutive pathway activation, we
assessed signaling after ex vivo culture in serum containing
medium providing a general growth stimulus. Most
interestingly, high S6 phosphorylation was maintained
in TTLshort primografts in contrast to low pS6 in TTLlong
leukemias upon culture (FIGURE 2E, F). Corresponding
to similar low constitutive AKT activation, no differences
in pAKT were detected after culture in all samples
(FIGURE 2G, H).
Moreover, we also analyzed STAT5 phosphorylation
and detected similar pSTAT5 levels with no significant
differences between TTLshort and TTLlong leukemias
(SUPPLEMENATRY FIGURE SF3).
Taken together, TTLshort/high-risk leukemias are
characterized by highly activated constitutive mTOR
signaling maintained upon ex vivo culture, in contrast
to low and decreasing mTOR activity in TTLlong ALL.
Interestingly, no differential AKT activation was detected,
suggesting that mTOR activation of TTLshort ALL is not
regulated by upstream PI3K/AKT signaling.

Given our results of hyperactivated mTOR signaling
in TTLshort leukemia, mTOR and PI3K signaling activities
were addressed in response to pathway inhibition using
the prototypic allosteric mTOR inhibitor rapamaycin
and the dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. Both
inhibitors clearly reduced pS6 in TTLshort leukemias while
pS6 levels in TTLlong remained unaffected. Interestingly,
concurrent PI3K/mTOR inhibition (NVP-BEZ235) led
to similar repression of pS6 as inhibition of mTOR by
rapamycin alone (FIGURE 2I, J; SUPPLEMENTARY
FIGURE 4). Rapamycin or NVP-BEZ235 did not affect
pAKT in both TTL phenotype groups (FIGURE 2K, L;
SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE 4), corresponding to similar
levels of low upstream PI3K/AKT signaling activity and
no induction of a positive feedback mechanism.
Thus, our data indicate that hyperactivated mTOR
signaling in TTLshort/high-risk ALL can be effectively
targeted. In line with low upstream AKT activity, mTOR
inhibition alone was equally effective as dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibition.

Effects of mTOR pathway inhibition in high-risk
ALL
Given our findings of hyperactivated mTOR
signaling and susceptibility for pathway inhibition in
TTLshort ALL, we next analyzed effects and mechanisms
of mTOR inhibition in TTLshort leukemia. Primary ALL
cells are not able to expand and proliferate if cultured ex
vivo in contrast to cell lines showing in vitro growth. To
address effects on cell proliferation in vitro, two BCPALL cell lines (Nalm-6, KOPN-8) were used. Consistent
with our findings in primary ALL samples, rapamycin and
NVP-BEZ235 reduced pS6 in both cell lines while pAKT
remained unaffected (FIGURE 3A).
However, Jurkat T-ALL cells with a phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutation showed constitutive
AKT-phosphorylation on both residues T308 and S473
which was inhibited by the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
NVP-BEZ235, while no pAKT was detected in the BCPALL cell lines (FIGURE 3A). Proliferation and cell cycle
progression were suppressed by both inhibitors to a similar
extent indicated by decreased cell numbers upon culture,
reduction of Ki67-positive cells, and lower proportions
of cells in S-phase upon drug exposure (FIGURE 3B, C,
D). In primary TTLshort ALL cells, both inhibitors showed
no increase in cell death, Annexin-V positivity, caspase
3 cleavage or LC3 conversion at different time points,
indicating no induction of overall cell death, apoptosis or
autophagy (FIGURE 3E, F, G, H).
Both inhibitors showed anti-proliferative in vitro
activity. However, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition was not

superior to mTOR inhibition alone, a finding that is in line
with our observation of low upstream PI3K/AKT activity.
Therefore, we focused our further analyses on mTOR
inhibition by rapamycin and investigated the effects upon
in vivo treatment. Recipients carrying a TTLshort/high-risk
leukemia (S7) were treated with rapamycin or vehicle for

5 days and sacrificed. A significant pS6 reduction was
identified upon in vivo rapamycin treatment (FIGURE

found in both treatment groups (FIGURE 4C, D, E)
indicating no feedback activation of PI3K/AKT signaling

led to reduced proliferative activity of leukemia cells
infiltrated into the recipient’s bone marrow (FIGURE 4F)
and spleen (FIGURE 4G, H). No Annexin-V positivity,
caspase 3 cleavage or LC3 conversion was detected
indicating neither induction of apoptotic nor autophagic
cell death upon in vivo treatment (FIGURE 4I, J, K;
SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE 5), in line with our results
on primary and cell line BCP-ALL.
Taken together, rapamycin inhibits highly activated
mTOR signaling in TTLshort/high-risk ALL resulting in
blocked proliferation of leukemia cells upon ex vivo
exposure and, most importantly, after in vivo treatment of
mice with manifest leukemia.

In summary, TTLshort ALL can successfully be treated
by rapamycin showing preclinical effectivity of single
treatment but more importantly also in combination with
established chemotherapy elements, clearly emphasizing
that inhibition of mTOR signaling is a potent therapeutic
approach for patients suffering from high-risk ALL.

DISCUSSION
Previously, we identified that in vivo proliferation of
patient leukemia cells transplanted onto NOD/SCID mice
is indicative of poor patient outcome and characterized
by a specific transcript profile including genes coding for
molecules regulating cell survival [6]. In this study, we
now addressed signaling activity in leukemia cells on a

Preclinical in vivo evaluation of mTOR inhibition
Next, we evaluated mTOR inhibition as therapeutic
approach to target hyperactivated mTOR/high risk/TTLshort
ALL. Three prototypic TTLshort primografts showing
characteristic high mTOR activity (S5, S6, S7) and two
TTLlong leukemias (L6, L7) with low mTOR signaling were
re-transplanted onto recipients. Upon ALL manifestation,
vehicle (V) or rapamycin (R) was administered for a given
time of two weeks and time until leukemia reoccurrence
(time to reoccurrence, TTR) was quantified for each
recipient. In all three TTLshort leukemias, a significant
delay of post-treatment leukemia growth was observed
upon rapamycin treatment (FIGURE 5A: S5, S6, S7). In
contrast, rapamycin did not prolong leukemia free survival
in TTLlong primografts or only to a small extent (FIGURE
5A: L6, L7).
In addition to single rapamycin treatment, we also
evaluated rapamycin in combination with multi-agent
remission induction chemotherapy used in pediatric
protocols (vincristine, dexamethasone and asparaginase,
VDA). Importantly, in TTLshort/high-risk ALL combination
of chemotherapy with rapamycin induced a clear superior
survival compared to chemotherapy alone, in contrast
to a minimal delay of few days in the TTLlong leukemia
(FIGURE 5B; SUPPLEMENTARY TABLE ST3).

functional level including preclinical in vivo evaluation of
targeted pathway inhibition.
Re-investigating our gene expression data set
employing gene set enrichment analysis, we identified
enrichment of the TTL profile in mTOR-annotated gene
sets further supporting that mTOR signaling is involved
in driving rapid leukemia engraftment and early patient
relapse. Moreover, using connectivity map analysis, we
also found a significant overlap of the TTL profile with
gene profiles induced by mTOR pathway inhibitors,
again pointing to involvement of activated mTOR
and to potential effectivity of its inhibition in TTLshort
ALL. Intriguingly, on the functional level we found
a clear difference in activity of mTOR signaling with
hyperactivation in leukemia cells derived from TTLshort/
high-risk patients, which could be effectively targeted by
rapamycin resulting in decreased growth, proliferation and
successful in vivo treatment.
The serine/threonine kinase mTOR is a central
downstream regulator shared by different pathways
controlling cellular growth and survival [14]. Aberrant
mTOR pathway activation has been reported in different
cancers including hematologic malignancies by different
mechanisms [15]. Mutational or functional loss of
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a molecule
negatively modulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling,
results in resistance and promotion of T-ALL [16, 17]. In
Philadelphia-chromosome positive (Ph+) B-lineage ALL,
constitutive BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity directly
drives PI3K/mTOR signaling and leukemogenesis [1820]. Recently, a subtype of BCP-ALL has been described
which, despite Ph-negativity, is characterized by a gene
expression profile similar to the profile of Ph+-ALL and
associated with poor outcome (“Ph- or BCR/ABL-like”)
[21, 22]. Leukemias of this Ph-like subgroup frequently
show gene alterations and dysregulated expression of
cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) and activating
Janus kinase (JAK) mutations [13]. Thymic stromalderived lymphopoietin (TSLP), the ligand binding to
CRLF2, induces leukemia proliferation involving mTOR
signaling [7] and cases of Ph-like ALL with aberrant
CRLF2 expression displayed increased mTOR signaling
activity [8, 23]. In contrast to these reports, none of the
ALL samples included in our study carried BCR/ABL
gene fusions, JAK mutations, CRLF2 gene alterations
or dysregulated CRLF2-transcript or surface receptor
expression. Thus, mTOR hyperactivation in TTLshort BCPALL described in this study is not due to aberrant CRLF2,
JAK or BCR/ABL activity. Alterations of the gene IKZF1
are associated with inferior outcome and are frequently
present in ALL with a Ph-like expression profile [22],
however a direct association of IKZF1 alterations and
mTOR signaling has not been described. Two samples
included into this study showed IKZF1 deletions and
exhibited a TTLshort/poor prognosis phenotype, in line
with the adverse outcome reported for patients with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IKZF1 alterations. Recently, genomic profiling of Ph-like
ALL revealed different kinase-activating gene alterations
associated with STAT5 activation [24]. Interestingly,
we detected no different STAT5 signaling activities in
leukemia samples of both TTL phenotypes suggesting that
TTLshort/high mTOR activity ALL is not associated with
these gene alterations and corresponding upstream kinase
activations.
No increased AKT-phosphorylation was observed
in any of the patient-derived xenografts corresponding
to absent PI3K/AKT signaling activity in our sample
cohort. Similar to our findings, low or absent constitutive
AKT activation was observed in CRLF2 wildtype and a
majority of Ph-negative BCP-ALL patient samples [8,
25]. Furthermore, specific in vivo AKT inhibition did
not affect BCP-ALL growth in contrast to solid tumor
xenografts [26], suggesting that leukemia survival is
not controlled by the PI3K/AKT axis in these cases.
Along this line, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition in TTLshort
ALL in our study was equally effective as mTOR
inhibition alone, a finding which is consistent with low
PI3K/AKT activity observed in our samples. Moreover,
inhibition of mTOR, both ex vivo and in vivo, did not
induce upstream AKT-phosphorylation, indicating that
a positive feedback mechanism, leading to activation of
upstream PI3K/AKT signaling after mTOR inhibition
described for malignancies with constitutive PI3K/AKT
signaling including acute myeloid leukemia [27, 28], is not
operative in TTLshort ALL. Accordingly, we also observed
absent PI3K/AKT signaling and no positive feedback loop
in two BCP-ALL cell lines. Importantly, in contrast to our
findings in BCP-ALL, active PI3K/AKT signaling was
seen in the PTEN mutated Jurkat T-ALL cell line.
With this, we identified mTOR hyperactivation
as potential driver for TTLshort/high-risk ALL. However,
unlike to other ALL subtypes as described above,
increased mTOR signaling in TTLshort ALL is activated
independently of upstream PI3K/AKT signaling. In our
previous study characterizing TTLshort engraftment by
expression profiling, genes coding for mTOR modulating
molecules have been identified to be highly de-regulated in
line with the molecules’ functions inhibiting or activating
mTOR (DDIT4Llow/RHEBhigh/FRAP1high) [6]. Most
importantly, the regulators identified interact directly with
mTOR not involving signaling through PI3K/AKT: RHEB
(Ras homolog enrichend in brain) binds specifically to
mTOR complex 1 thereby leading to its activation [29],
FRAP1 codes for mTOR itself, and DDIT4L (DNAdamage-inducible-transcript-4-like) inhibits mTOR acting
downstream of AKT [30], suggesting direct modulation of
mTOR signaling independently of PI3K/AKT.
We showed that hyperactivated mTOR signaling
can be efficiently repressed, identifying a therapeutic
target in these high-risk leukemias. Given the central
function of mTOR in regulation of cellular growth and
proliferation, its inhibition is approached by different
1390

Oncotarget

substances including rapamycin-derivatives and dual
mTOR/PI3K inhibitors [31]. However, based on our
results of inapparent PI3K/AKT signaling with no superior
effectivity of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition, we focused our
further investigations on principle effects and the impact
of mTOR inhibition including its pre-clinical effectivity
in TTLshort/high-risk ALL per se, using rapamycin as a
prototypic mTOR inhibitor.
Inhibition of mTOR signaling resulted in decreased
cellular proliferation in vitro, and importantly also in
patient-derived leukemias upon in vivo therapy. In line
with these findings in our study, repression of proliferation
and cell growth by rapamycin or derivatives was reported
for BCP-ALL cell lines and primary patient or xenograft
samples [23, 32-35]. Despite this potent anti-proliferative
effect of rapamycin on ALL, diverging findings on
induction of apoptosis or autophagy by mTOR inhibition
were described. Consistent with our results showing no
apoptotic or autophagic cell death ex vivo and upon in
vivo treatment, no apoptosis was induced upon exposure
of primary (non-Ph+) BCP-ALL cells to rapamycin [36],
or only in a subset of patient BCP-ALL samples while
no apoptosis was detected in the remaining specimens
[37]. Along this line, the rapalogue everolimus induced
apoptosis only to a limited extend but induced autophagy
in single BCP-ALL samples [33, 34]. However,
growth delay of different xenografted B-lineage ALL
samples sensitive to mTOR inhibition was observed
demonstrating anti-proliferative in vivo activity [23, 33,
35, 38]. In line, we observed significantly postponed
leukemia reoccurrence upon rapamycin treatment in
animals engrafted with TTLshort leukemias indicating in
vivo effectivity on mTOR driven TTLshort/high-risk ALL.
However, no such effect was observed in recipients
carrying TTLlong ALL, pointing to mTOR-independent
growth in this favorable subtype.
In a clinical situation, novel compounds will not be
applied as single agents but along with established therapy
regimens. Particularly, in order to efficiently incorporate
mTOR inhibition into clinical treatment strategies,
combination with cell death inducing drugs such as
conventional chemotherapeutics will be required. We
extended our preclinical analyses and included multi-agent
chemotherapy resembling remission induction treatment
and observed clearly increased activity of rapamycin
together with chemotherapy in high-risk/TTLshort ALL.
Similarly, synergism of mTOR inhibition and single
cyotostatic drugs was reported in two B-lineage ALL
xenografts (temsirolimus/methotrexate) and solid tumor
samples (rapamycin/vincristine or cyclophosphamide) [39,
40]. In TTLlong phenotype ALL however, no clear superior
survival upon combination treatment was observed.
Inhibition of mTOR is currently evaluated in
relapsed/high-risk ALL in different clinical studies.
However,
TTLshort/hyperactivated
mTOR
ALL
characterized in this study is not associated with classical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

high-risk criteria [6], and signaling hyperactivity and
susceptibility to mTOR inhibition might be heterogeneous
among different individual leukemias. This clearly
emphasizes the need for upfront identification of
patients who would benefit from directed mTOR
inhibition. Detection of aberrant signaling and pretreatment evaluation of different inhibitors by cytometric
phosphosignaling analysis of patient ALL specimens
assessing individual pathway activity would be a feasible
strategy and might be implemented into the routine
diagnostic immunophenotypic work-up.
Taken together, we provide functional evidence that
the TTLshort/early relapse ALL is characterized by highly
activated mTOR signaling driving in vivo leukemia
growth. Hyperactivated mTOR signaling in TTLshort
ALL was successfully targeted leading to significant
superior leukemia free survival upon mTOR inhibition by
rapamycin, and even more efficiently in combination with
remission induction multi-agent chemotherapy pointing
to potential benefit from combined mTOR inhibition
and cytotoxic therapy for these high-risk patients.
Most importantly, these poor prognosis patients are not
defined by classical high-risk characteristics or recently
described aberrations but could be identified by analysis
of functional pathway activity.

METHODS
Ethics Statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the author’s
institutional review board.

Xenograft ALL
Xenograft ALL samples derived from BCPALL patients at diagnosis were established using our
NOD/SCID/huALL xenotransplant mouse model
and time to leukemia (TTL) was estimated as weeks
from transplantation until disease onset as previously
described [6, 41]. Seven TTLshort (S1-7) and 7 TTLlong
(L1-7) leukemias (median TTL 8.6 and 22.0 weeks,
respectively) were investigated. Patient samples
were obtained after informed consent in accordance
with the institution’s ethical review board. Animal
experiments were approved by the respective authority
(Regierungspräsidium Tübingen, Versuch-Nr. 980).
Patients were diagnosed and treated according to ALLBFM 2000 or AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 protocols (http://
clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00430118; NCT01117441).
Immunophenotyping was carried out following standard
1391

Oncotarget

procedures [42]. CRLF2 over-expression (20-fold above
median expression in a cohort of 464 BCP-ALL cases)
and P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion were analyzed as previously
described [43]. IKZF1 deletions were investigated by
Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification
(MLPA; SALSA MLPA P335-A3 ALL-IKZF1 probemix,
MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) according
to the instructions of the manufacturer. Samples of
pediatric ALL patients in complete remission were used
as wild type controls. The fragments were separated on
an ABI-3130 Genetic Analyzer instrument (Applied
Biosystems, Monza, Italy) and data were analyzed
using Coffalyser.Net software (MRC-Holland). Surface
TSLPR was stained (allophycocyanin-conjugated antiTSLPR; Biolegend, Fell, Germany) and assessed on
a LSRII cytometer (BD, Heidelberg, Germany) with
the corresponding isotype control. IGH@CRLF2 gene
fusions were analyzed by PCR (primer first exon IGH:
5´-AATACTTCCAGCACT-3´; primer third exon
CRLF2: 5´-GTCCCATTCCTGATGGAGAA-3´; 94°C, 2
minutes; 30 cycles: 94°C, 30 seconds; 59°C, 30 seconds;
72°C, 1 minute; and 72°C, 10 minutes. CRLF2 (F232C)
and JAK2 (R683G) mutations were analyzed on a GSJunior-454 instrument (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT,
USA) as previously described [44]. Patient and xenograft
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Germany) and stocks were frozen. Cells were thawed,
passaged and authenticated by single tandem repeat
profiling and subsequently used for experiments. Patientderived cultured glioblastoma cells (G40) used as positive
controls for mTOR inhibition induced LC3 conversion
were kindly provided by Dr. A. Westhoff, Ulm. Cells
were kept in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% L-glutamine (Gibco Life
Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37°C in humidified
air with 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were incubated with
rapamycin or NVP-BEZ235 (LC Laboratories, Woburn,
MA, USA) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO;
Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) or solvent.
Primograft cells (L5) incubated with the phosphatase
inhibitor pervanadate (20 µM, 3 hrs.) inducing maximum
tyrosine-phosporylation were used as positive controls as
previously described [8, 23].
S6-, AKT-, and STAT5- phosphorylation was
assessed by phosphoflow cytometry as previously
described [47] (Alexa-Fluor 647-conjugated anti-p-S6,
Ser235/236; Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated anti-p-AKT,
Thr308; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA; and Alexa
Fluor 647-conjugated anti-p-STAT5, Tyr 694, BD). For
cell cycle analysis methanol-fixed cells incubated with
RNase (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) were
stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; EMD
Chemicals San Diego, CA, USA) [48]. Ki67 staining was
carried out on paraformaldehyde-fixed (Polysciences,
Eppelheim, Germany), saponin-permeabilized cells using
Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated anti-Ki67 (BD). Cell death
was assessed by flow cytometry according to forward
and side scatter criteria. Apoptotic cells were stained
with Annexin-V-FLUOS (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
following the manufacturers instructions. Cells were
assessed on a LSRII cytometer (BD) and data were
analyzed using FlowJo 8.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA)
or Cytobank (http://www.cytobank.org) [49] software.
Western blot analysis and protein extraction were
performed as previously described [41] using anti- p-S6
(S235/236), S6, p-AKT (T308), p-AKT (S473), caspase
3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), LC3 (Thermo
Scientific, Braunschweig, Germnay), AKT (BD),
ß-ACTIN (Sigma-Aldrich), secondary horseradishperoxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
and enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific).
Specificity of bands was identified by molecular weight
markers. Densitometric quantification was performed
using ImageJ 1.45s software [50].
Anti-Ki67 and -CD19 immunohistology staining
was performed using the Dako Real Detection system
based on alkaline phosphatase and permanent red
chromogen for detection of bound antibody (Dako, CA,
USA) as previously described [51]. Anti-active caspase 3
immunostaining (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was performed
as previously described [52].

Analysis of gene expression data
Based on our previously generated data set [6]
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; GSE13576), gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA, v2.0.14; http://www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea) [45] was performed analyzing
enrichment of a given gene set with 189 gene sets
annotated in the Molecular Signature Database, C6:
oncogenic signatures (http://www.broadinstitute.org/
gsea/msigdb). The ‘gene_set’ permutation configuration
was used, gene sets with NOM p-value ≤ .05 and FDR
q-value ≤ .01 were considered significant. Connectivity
map analysis (cmap build 02, http://www.broadinstitute.
org/cmap) [46] was performed using the top differentially
regulated probe sets (q-value ≤ .25; n=398) of our
previously obtained TTL signature [6].

Ex vivo analysis of leukemia cells
Xenograft leukemia cells were isolated from spleens
of leukemia bearing mice transplanted with primary
patient cells or already established xenografts and directly
(without interim cryopreservation) subjected to analyses.
Cell suspensions were prepared from infiltrated spleens
and contained more than 90% of BCP-ALL cells as
measured by flow cytometry. Cell lines (Nalm-6, KOPN8 and Jurkat) were obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig,
