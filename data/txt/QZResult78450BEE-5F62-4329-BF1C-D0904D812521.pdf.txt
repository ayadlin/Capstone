ABSTRACT
Anti-microtubule drugs, such as paclitaxel (PTX), are extensively used for the
treatment of numerous cancers. However, growing evidence has shown that PTX
resistance, either intrinsic or acquired, frequently occurs in patients and results in
the failure of treatment, contributing to the high cancer mortality rate. Therefore,
it is necessary to identify the genes or pathways involved in anti-microtubule drug
resistance for future successful treatment of cancers. Pygopus2 (Pygo2), which contains
a Zn-coordinated plant homeodomain (PHD) finger domain, is critical for β-catenindependent transcriptional switches in normal and malignant tissues and is overexpressed in various cancers, including human brain glioma. In this study, we report
that over-expression of Pygo2 inhibited the efficacy of PTX and contributed to cell
multidrug resistance in two different ways. First, over-expression of Pygo2 inhibited the
PTX-induced phosphorylation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), suppressing the proteolytic
cleavage of procaspase-8/9 and further inhibiting the activation of caspase-3, which also
inhibits the activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway, ultimately inhibiting cell apoptosis.
Second, over-expression of Pygo2 facilitated the expression of P-glycoprotein, which
acts as a drug efflux pump, by promoting the transcription of Multi-drug resistance 1
(MDR1) at the MDR1 promoter loci, resulting in acceleration of the efflux of PTX.

INTRODUCTION

and ultimately apoptosis [3]. Many types of solid tumors,
including human brain glioma, are treated with PTX alone or
in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Previous
studies have demonstrated that PTX can be delivered by
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and kill glioblastoma cells
[4, 5] when MSCs loaded with PTX are in close proximity [6].
In addition, conjugated linoleic acid-paclitaxel (CLA-PTX),
which can access the brain tissue and target brain tumors,
was synthesized and showed great potential to become a new
prodrug of PTX [7]. However, despite being one of the most
widely used chemotherapeutics for solid tumors, the exact
mechanisms and the factors that govern the anticancer function

Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most effective anticancer
agents available clinically, and it has a wide spectrum of
activity against solid tumors [1]. It functions as an inhibitor
of the dynamic instability of microtubules, which is crucial
during mitosis because the polymerization dynamics of
the mitotic spindle accomplishes the proper alignment and
segregation of the chromosomes to form daughter cells [2].
Preventing the requisite dynamics leads to arrest of mitosis

potential, phosphorylation of Bcl-2, activation of caspases

of PTX are not completely understood [8]. Growing evidence
has shown that PTX resistance has become more frequent,
and it is known that drug resistance is a multifactorial process
that likely develops through a series of genetic and/or protein
modifications. However, the mechanism responsible for
chemo-resistance in glioma remains poorly understood [9–11].
Resistance to PTX has been confirmed to be associated with
over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [10], encoded by
the multidrug resistance gene MDR1, which functions as a
drug efflux pump [12, 13]. The transcription of MDR1 can be
regulated by several pathways due to the complex pattern of
the promoter [14]. Moreover, epigenetic regulation, including
histone modification and DNA methylation, adds more
complexity and has been extensively studied over the past
several years [15, 16].
Dysregulation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway is associated with the development
and progression of many malignancies. A growing body
of evidence indicates that Pygopus2 (Pygo2) acts as an
important coactivator of the Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional
complex, and functions as an enhancer of β-catenin
activity in the classical Wnt pathway [17]. There is a
highly conserved structure called the PHD domain with
a Zn2+ coordinating finger at the C terminus of Pygo2
[18]; previous studies have shown that PHD-containing
proteins can act as protein code readers to link the
chromatin remodeling complex to specific changes in
gene transcription, as demonstrated for Wnt/β-catenin
target genes. For example, Pygo2 was found to possess
the ability to directly bind to histone H3 trimethylated at
lysine 4 (H3K4me3) [19], associate with histone-modifying
enzymes and recruits them to recruit chromatin to facilitate
H3K4 trimethylation and histone acetylation in breast
cancer cells [20]. Pygo2 has been reported to be overexpressed in several malignant tumors, including those of
epithelial ovarian cancer, breast cancer and human glioma,
and appears to play an important role in the growth of these
tumors. [21–23]. Moreover, our previous study found that
Pygo2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly
higher in glioma tissues and cells, and abnormally high
expression of Pygo2 protein in glioma patients was
correlated with a poor prognosis. In addition, knockdown
of Pygo2 inhibits glioma cell proliferation, migration and
invasion [24]. However, the relationship between Pygo2
and multidrug resistance has been rarely studied. The
present work aims to investigate the molecular mechanism
of Pygo2-mediated inhibition of the efficacy of PTXinduced apoptosis and its role in multidrug resistance.

microtubule dynamics. We previously reported that
Pygo2 was up-regulated in human brain glioma tissues
and cell lines [24]. To investigate the effect of Pygo2
expression on PTX-induced cell growth arrest in human
brain glioma U-87MG and U251 cell lines, several
groups of stably transfected cell lines were constructed by
transfecting cells with recombinant expression plasmids
encoding pHM6, pHM6-Pygo2, pHM6-Pygo2 shRNA
and pHM6-scr shRNA. The relative Pygo2 mRNA
expression was detected by qRT-PCR in human glioma
U-87MG (Figure 1C) and U251 (Figure 1F) cell lines
after treatment with 30 nM PTX for 48 h. MTT and trypan
blue dye exclusion assays were performed to examine
the effects of exogenous Pygo2 on the proliferation and
viability, respectively, of the human glioma cell line
U-87MG (Figure 1A and 1D). As expected, the viability
of cells treated with PTX was more depressed than that of
untreated cells (control). However, over-expression of
Pygo2 (PTX+pHM6 Pygo2) promoted cell viability
and resulted in an increased cell proliferation rate in a
time-dependent manner. In contrast, silencing of Pygo2
enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of PTX. Consistent
results were observed in U251 cells (Figure 1B and 1E).
Overall, our results indicate that Pygo2 enhances the
proliferation of glioma cell lines treated with PTX and
promotes PTX multidrug resistance in human brain glioma
U-87MG and U251 cells.

Pygo2 promotes metastasis in glioma cells
treated with PTX
Cell migration and invasion were further evaluated
in glioma U-87MG cells treated with PTX by examining
the effects of exogenous Pygo2. Transwell assays were
used to demonstrate the effect of Pygo2 on cell migration.
Compared with PTX-treated cells, cells transfected with
exogenous Pygo2 exhibited a significantly increased
migratory ability (Figure 2A). To examine the effect of
Pygo2 on cell invasion, U-87MG cells were cultured
in Transwell chambers pre-coated with matrigel for 8 h
prior to measurements. We found that increased Pygo2
expression significantly increased the ability of the cells
to cross the matrigel-coated inserts (Figure 2B). Taken
together, our results demonstrated that high Pygo2 levels
enhance the invasion and migration capacity of human
glioma U-87MG cells treated with PTX.

cells

RESULTS

It is generally accepted that anti-microtubule agents
such as vincristine and PTX can induce apoptosis [25, 26].
To further understand how enforced expression of Pygo2
inhibits the efficacy of PTX in inducing cell proliferation
arrest, we evaluated the apoptosis rate in the six different
stably transfected cell lines using flow cytometry after

staining the cells with annexin V-FITC and propidium
iodide (PI). We found that the percentage of apoptotic cells
increased to 58.2% after treatment with PTX, and cells
transfected with pHM6 and pHM6-scr shRNA vector were
not significantly different. We noticed that the percentage
of apoptotic cells was much lower in the cells expressing
exogenous Pygo2 protein (PTX+pHM6-Pygo2) compared
with cells treated with PTX alone. In contrast, silencing
of Pygo2 (PTX+Pygo2 shRNA) enhanced PTX-induced
apoptosis (Figure 3A–3B).

this decrease was accompanied by an increase in the
percentage of sub-G1 phase cells (Figure 3C–3D). The
result in U-87MG and U251 cells was similar. These
results indicate that Pygo2 silencing enhances the druginduced apoptosis partly via accumulation of cells in
subG1 phase.

Pygo2 inhibits the activation of the JNK/SAPK
pathway
It is well known that the JNK/SAPK cascade has
an apoptosis-promoting role, specifically in apoptotic
processes resulting from microtubular dysfunction
[27, 28], and activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway can
be induced by PTX [29]. We also detected activation of
the JNK/SAPK pathway following treatment with PTX
(Figure 4A–4B). To investigate the relationship between
the expression level of Pygo2 and the contribution of the
JNK/SAPK pathway to PTX-induced apoptosis, we first
examined the JNK protein levels in the stably transfected
cell lines treated with PTX. Western blot analysis

Pygo2 inhibits PTX-induced cell cycle arrest
Cell cycle profiles of PTX-treated human glioma
cells were evaluated using flow cytometry. A clear
G2/M arrest was observed in the cells that were stably
transfected with either pHM6 or pHM6-scr shRNA vector.
A decreased percentage of G2/M cells were found in the
cells expressing exogenous Pygo2 protein. In contrast,
in the cells expressing low levels of Pygo2 there was
also a decreased percentage of G2/M cells found, but

30 nM PTX for 48 h; normal cells were used as a control. (A–B) An MTT assay revealed that Pygo2 counteracted the effect of PTX-induced

demonstrated that the level of JNK was significantly
reduced in the cells expressing exogenous Pygo2 protein
compared with normal U251 or U-87MG cells. In contrast,
there was an increased level of JNK in the cells expressing
low levels of Pygo2 (Figure 4A–4B). The results of a
western blot analysis of c-Jun, a substrate of JNK, were
similar to those of JNK.

We also tested the effect of Pygo2 on the
transcriptional activity of AP-1, which is regulated
by the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway, using an AP-1
reporter plasmid (pAP-1-luci) (Figure 4C, 4E). Decreased
activity was detected in the cells expressing exogenous
Pygo2. The results of experiments with the transcription

demonstrate that Pygo2 inhibits the apoptotic efficiency

and inducing a decrease in AP-1 activity.

expression of exogenous Pygo2. In addition, the mobility
shift of the 30  kDa band appeared much earlier when
endogenous Pygo2 was knocked down. This indicates that
PTX induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation, as evidenced by the
presence of several immunoreactive bands, was inhibited
by over-expression of exogenous Pygo2. In contrast, the
phosphorylation of Bcl-2 induced by PTX was more
sensitive when endogenous Pygo2 was knocked down.
To investigate the effects of Pygo2 on PTX-induced
activation of caspase proteins and other apoptosisrelated proteins, Caspase-Glo® 3/7, Caspase-Glo® 8
and Caspase-Glo® 9 assays were performed. The stably
transfected cell lines were treated with 30 nM PTX for
48 h, and then, a proluminescent caspase substrate and
a proprietary thermostable luciferase was added. The
substrate underwent cleavage and generated a “glow-type”
luminescent signal that was proportional to the activities
of caspase-3/8/9. We found that the cells that overexpressed exogenous Pygo2 had less caspase-3, -8 and
-9 activity compared to the control cells. In contrast, low
Pygo2 expression showed more effect on the activation of
caspase-3, -8 and -9 (Figure 5C–5H). Together, these data
demonstrate that Pygo2 inhibits the apoptotic efficiency

Pygo2 inhibits the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and
the activation of caspases
Because the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 induced
by PTX also plays a critical role in apoptotic decisions
[30], we also studied the relationship between the Pygo2
expression level and the phosphorylation level of Bcl-2
in human brain glioma U-87MG and U251 cell lines.
To investigate the effect of Pygo2 on PTX-induced
phosphorylation of Bcl-2, the stably transfected cell lines
were treated with 30 nM PTX in a time-dependent manner.
Bcl-2 phosphorylation was examined by western blot.
As shown in Figure 5A–5B, immunoblotting with antiBcl-2 antibody revealed two bands of 30 and 28 kDa in
extracts from the control cells at the 24 h and 48 h time
points. However, the 30 kDa band disappeared 72 h later.
We discovered the same PTX-induced mobility shift of
the 30 kDa band, but at a later time point, with over-

compared to the cells with low levels of Pygo2, and the sub-G1 index was increased in the Pygo2-knockdown cells. Data are presented as

how human brain glioma cells may develop multidrug
resistance to PTX through MDR1, the stably transfected
U-87MG and U251 cells were induced by PTX in a
time course experiment, and the MDR1 expression was
evaluated. The selected concentrations of PTX were 1,
5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 nM. A concentration of 30 nM was
chosen for the next experiment because it had the highest
MDR1-inducing effect (Figure 6A–6B). It was revealed
that P-gp was induced after treatment with PTX, and

the induction reached a maximum at the 8 h time point
(Figure 6C–6D) and was down-regulated following a more
prolonged exposure time, indicating that P-gp induction
was an early event. In addition, we discovered that the
MDR1 expression level was much higher in the cells
expressing exogenous Pygo2 compared with control cells,
and in contrast, there was a decreased level of MDR1 in
the cells expressing low levels of Pygo2.
We further investigated P-gp transport activity
using the fluorescent substrate Rho-123. The activity

of P-gp was measured by examining the intracellular
accumulation of Rho-123 [31]. The activity of P-gp also
reached a maximum at the same concentration and time
points determined in the qRT-PCR assay (Figure 6E–6L).
Together, these data demonstrate that Pygo2 inhibits the
apoptotic efficiency of PTX, in part by facilitating the
expression of P-gp, which functions as a drug efflux pump
that pumps intracellular PTX out of the cell.

Pygo2 functions as a transcriptional co-regulator
of P-gp

been shown to play important roles in the apoptotic response
[37]. Bcl-2, specifically, was found to be phosphorylated
after treatment with PTX [30]. Therefore, we set out to
examine the relationship between the Pygo2 expression
level and the phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Specifically, we
found that the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 induced by PTX
was inhibited by over-expression of exogenous Pygo2. In
contrast, the band of phosphorylated Bcl-2 appeared earlier
when Pygo2 was knocked down (Figure 4). In addition,
a decreased percentage of G2/M cells was found in both
Pygo2 over-expressing and Pygo2-silenced cells, but
an increase in the percentage of sub-G1 phase cells was
observed in the Pygo2-silenced cells (Figure 2), which was
similar to the results of an earlier study [38].
We further examined how Pygo2 knockdown or
Pygo2 expression impacted the activation of the JNK
pathway. A low expression level of JNK was detected in
cells over-expressing Pygo2 (Figure 3). The anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins have been reported to be phosphorylated
and inactivated by JNK, which is induced by microtubuleinteracting agents, including PTX [39–41], although
this conclusion is controversial because some studies
indicate that phosphorylation may enhance the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 [42] and may stabilize Bcl-2
by preventing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation, which
increases prosurvival signaling [43]. An earlier study
also discovered that PTX-induced phosphorylation of
Bcl-2 can occur in the absence of JNK activation [44].
Therefore, these data indicate that the JNK pathway may
not be the physiologically relevant kinase pathway that
induces Bcl-2 phosphorylation in vivo. Consistent with
this hypothesis, the results of our study indicated that
Pygo2 may function as an intermediary that regulates
another kinase or a phosphatase that induces increased
Bcl-2 phosphorylation, also possibility play a crucial role
in regulating the activation of JNK though the upstream
element. However, further investigation is necessary to
delineate the mechanistic route of the apoptosis pathway
induced by PTX or other anti-microtubule agents.
Apoptosis is initiated through two fundamental
pathways: the extrinsic (death receptor-mediated)
pathway, which is initiated through the activation of
caspase-8 by death receptors, followed by the caspase8-induced activation of an effector caspase (caspase-3);
and the intrinsic (mitochondrial-mediated) pathway,
which is initiated by the activation of caspase-9 following
cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, which in turn
activates caspase-3. As shown in Figure 7, we also revealed
that silencing Pygo2 significantly enhances the activation
of caspases 9, 8 and 3 in human U-87MG and U251 cells.
Therefore, it seems that Pygo2 not only inhibits PTXinduced apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway but also
through the intrinsic pathway. It is most likely that Pygo2
inhibits the disintegration of mitochondria induced by
PTX, resulting in cytochrome c escape to the cytoplasm.
Then, cytochrome c interacts with procaspase-9, leading

Previous studies have indicated that the PHD
domain can act as a transcriptional co-activator in the
presence of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and this
activity is dependent on binding of the PHD finger to
H3K4me3 [32, 33]. To investigate the possible molecular
mechanism of Pygo2 up-regulation of the expression of Pgp, a CHIP assay was performed using specific polyclonal
antibodies against Pygo2 and H3K4me3. Binding of the
MDR1 DNA promoter-specific fragment was detected. We
found that the two transcriptional factors were both present
on MDR1 promoter loci, and the relative MDR1 mRNA
promoter enrichment was reduced after endogenous Pygo2
was knocked down, accompanied by the down-regulation
of H3K4me3. In contrast, there were increased levels of
H3K4me3 on the MDR1 promoter loci after exogenous
Pygo2 expression (Figure 7A–7B). These data indicated
that Pygo2 functions as a transcriptional co-regulator when
MDR1 expression is induced by treatment with PTX.

DISCUSSION
PTX, which is used to treat human brain glioma,
acts via a distinct mechanism [34]. It binds to tubulin,
promoting microtubule assembly and stabilizing
microtubules by bundle formation. However, the efficacy
of PTX-based chemotherapy for cancer treatment has
been impeded by drug resistance [35]. The mechanisms
of acquired resistance have been extensively studied by
generating cell models in the laboratory and examining
cellular processes such as decreased drug uptake into cells,
activation of detoxifying enzymes, increased drug efflux
and inhibition of apoptotic signaling pathways [36]. In
this work, we aimed to determine the role of Pygo2 in the
drug resistance of human glioma cells after treatment with
PTX. As a result, we found that Pygo2 inhibits the efficacy
of PTX-induced apoptosis. The molecular mechanism may
involve accumulation of cells in sub-G1 phase, modulation
of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway, decreased AP-1
and ATF2 activity, modulation of Bcl-2 phosphorylation,
reduced caspase activity and facilitation of the expression
of P-gp, which pumps intracellular PTX out of the cell.
According to the results of cell proliferation and
cell viability assays, exposure of human U-87MG and
U251 cells to moderate cytotoxic concentrations of PTX
can induce cell growth arrest and cell apoptosis (Figure 1),
and we noticed that silencing Pygo2 decreased the
proliferation ratio of cells; it also enhanced the apoptotic
efficiency of PTX in U-87MG and U251 cells. In contrast,
over-expression of exogenous Pygo2 promoted cell
proliferation and inhibited the PTX-induced apoptotic
efficiency (Figure  2). Because the Bcl-2 family plays a
critical decision-making role in cell survival and apoptosis,
especially the subfamilies of the Bcl-2 protein, which have

to the activation of procaspase-9 through proteolytic
cleavage [45, 46]. Cleaved caspase-9 in turn cleaves and
activates procaspase-3 [47], with the effect of increasing
the activation of the JNK pathway. The human glioma
cells were led to apoptosis by cleaved caspase-3, which
finally executed apoptosis by cleaving a number of protein
substrates that are essential for DNA repair [47].
Growing evidence suggests that JNK is closely
related to the expression of MDR [48, 49]. Here, using a
CHIP assay, we demonstrated that Pygo2 was preloaded
at the MDR1 promoter before stimulation. It is possible
that the JNK pathway regulates the expression of Pygo2
in a peculiar manner, which was not been revealed so far.
Combined with the above results, Pygo2 protein appears
to provide regulatory feedback to the JNK pathway
through the phosphorylation of JNK, but this hypothesis
requires further validation. In addition, we noticed that
the expression of MDR1 was increased in the cells that
had a normal Pygo2 expression level following exposure
to PTX. This indicates that there are other transcription
activation factors that can regulate the expression of
MDR1. We discovered that c-Jun was reduced when
Pygo2 was highly expressed. c-Jun is a protein that forms
the activator protein 1 (AP-1) early response transcription
factor. It is well known that c-Jun can be activated
through double phosphorylation on serine 63 and 73 that
is mediated by the JNK pathway [50]. The data presented
here suggest that c-Jun may play an important role in upregulation of MDR1 and P-gp expression.
In addition, the occupancy of H3K4me3 at the
promoter was moderately increased in cells expressing

exogenous Pygo2, and the transcription product of
P-gp was clearly increased (Figure 8). In contrast, the
enrichment of H3K4me3 was reduced when endogenous
Pygo2 was silenced, similar to the results of an earlier
study [51], which demonstrated that Pygo2 promotes
Wnt target gene transcription by recruiting the mediator
complex via interactions with Med12 and Med13
through the N-terminal domain of Pygo2. Pygo2 is
generally considered to be an activating transcription
factor of the Wnt pathway, but in a previous study, we
also proposed that it plays an important role in activating
the transcription of another gene. Here, we verified this
assumption that Pygo2 could activate the transcription of
other genes in addition to Wnt pathway target genes.
In conclusion, these results demonstrated that
the molecular mechanism by which Pygo2 inhibits the
efficacy of PTX-induced apoptosis in human glioma
U-87MG and U251 cells involves two relevant activities.
In the cytoplasm, over-expression of exogenous Pygo2
inhibited PTX-induced activation of the apoptosis pathway
components. In the nucleus, elevated Pygo2 expression
functioned as a transcription activation factor that promoted
the expression of MDR1, facilitating the expression of
P-gp, which pumps PTX granules out of the cells.

Cell apoptosis and cycle assays

of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
USA), 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin
at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.
Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen,
USA) was used to transfect the U251 and U-87MG cell
lines according to the manufacturer’s instructions. U251
and U-87MG cells were treated with Lipofectamine 2000
followed by transfection with recombinant pHM6-Pygo2
and pHM6-Pygo2 shRNA expression plasmids and scrshRNA; pHM6 vector plasmid was used as a negative
control.

Cells were collected after treatment with PTX for
48  h. Cells were washed with 1 × PBS, centrifuged at
1500 rpm for 5 min and incubated with annexin V-FITC
(Cat# V13241, Invitrogen) for 10 min. Cells were then
stained with 10 μl of 40 μg/μl propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma,
USA). The apoptosis level of cells was determined with a
BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA)
and analyzed with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences).

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described
previously [24]. Briefly, the total protein from lysates of
U-87MG and U251 cells was extracted by re-suspending
the cell pellets in RIPA buffer. Western blot analyses were
performed with polyclonal antibodies against Pygo2,
JNK, c-Jun and Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA);
monoclonal β-actin antibody was used as a control
(Sigma, USA).

Survival (trypan blue dye exclusion) assay
Cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well
plates, treated with 30 nM PTX and incubated at 37°C
in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 48 h. Cells
were counted after staining with 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue
dye using a dual-chamber counting slide under a light
microscope. Non-viable cells were observed as bluestained, while viable cells excluded the stain.

Figure 8: Schematic illustration showing how Pygo2 inhibits the efficacy of PTX-induced apoptosis in human glioma
cells. PTX treatment of cells causes a series of apoptotic responses, including phosphorylation of Bcl-2, activation of caspase-8/9, and

activation of the JNK pathway, which were inhibited by over-expression of exogenous Pygo2 (Left). Cells also exhibited an increased
expression level of MDR1. P-gp acts as an efflux pump that pumps the PTX granules out of cells, and up-regulated expression of P-gp
further mediates PTX resistance. Over-expression of exogenous Pygo2, which occupies the promoter of MDR1, enhances the expression of
P-gp to strengthen the multidrug resistance (Right).

Luciferase reporter gene assay

RNA extraction and reverse-transcription
quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)

The transcription activity of AP-1 was tested using
a PathDetect Signal Transduction Pathway AP-1 cisReporting system (Cat# 219073, Agilent Technologies,
USA). Cells were transfected with 1 μg/μl pAP-1-Luc
plasmid that contained the luciferase reporter gene driven
by a basic promoter element plus a defined inducible cisenhancer element. The transcriptional activity of ATF2
was assessed using a PathDetect Signal Transduction
Pathway ATF2 trans-Reporting system (Cat# 219026,
Agilent Technologies). Cells were transfected with
1 mg/ml pFA-ATF2 fusion plasmid fused with the yeast
GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD), residues 1-147.
The fusion trans-activator plasmid contained the human
cytomegalovirus promoter to drive constitutive expression
of the trans-activator protein. Analyses were performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

RNA extraction
and
reverse-transcription
quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed as described
previously [24]. The following primers were used for
MDR1 mRNA, 5ʹ-GGAGGAGCAAAGAAGAAG-3ʹ and
5ʹ-AATGTAAGCAGCAACCAG-3ʹ; for Pygo2, 5ʹ-AGAA
AAGAAGCGAAGGAAGTCAAA-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GGTGAT
CCACCATGGGAGTT-3ʹ; and for β-actin, 5ʹ-CCAAGCA
GCATGAAGATCAA-3ʹ and 5ʹ-TCTGCTGGAAGGTG
CTGAG-3ʹ. β-actin was used as an internal control

Cell migration and invasion assays
Cell migration and invasion assays were performed
as described previously [52].

MTT assay

Determination of caspases activity

MTT assays were performed as described
previously [52].

The activity of caspase-3, -8 and -9 were measured
using a Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay (Cat# G8090, Promega,
USA), Caspase-Glo® 8 Assay (Cat# G8200, Promega,
USA) and Caspase-Glo® 9 Assay (Cat# G8210, Promega,
USA). Cells were collected after treatment with PTX
for 48 h, and then, reaction mixtures (100 mM HEPES,
10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 7.4) containing appropriate dilutions of enzyme,
proluminescent
caspase-3
DEVD-aminoluciferin
substrate (Ac-DEVD-AFC) or proluminogenic caspase-8
substrate (Ac-IETD-AFC) or proluminogenic caspase-9
substrate (Ac-LEHD-AFC) in a total volume of 100 μl
were added to the cells. Related caspase activity was
quantified by detection of the fluorescence of free AFC
after cleavage from the peptide substrate, with Ex. = 400
nm and Em. = 505 nm, using a fluorometer. Analyses
were performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (CHIP) was
performed as described previously [24]. The primers
used were 5ʹ-GGAGCAGTCATCTGTGGTGA-3ʹ and
5ʹ-CTCGAATGAGCTCAGGCTTC-3ʹ.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0
software for Windows. Differences in characteristics or
values were examined by χ2 and Fisher’s exact tests.
Statistical significance was based on a P-value of < 0.05.

Measurement of rhodamine-123 efflux

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

P-gp activity in U-87MG and U251 cells was
assessed based on rhodamine-123 (Rho-123) efflux. Cells
were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Rho-123 for 30 min at
37°C in DMEM w/o phenol-red, washed twice in icecold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended
in medium. Samples were then incubated at 37°C for
15 min. Rho-123 fluorescence in cells was measured at
530 nm on a FACScan flow cytometer supplied with a
488 nm argon laser by measuring median fluorescence
intensity (MFI).
