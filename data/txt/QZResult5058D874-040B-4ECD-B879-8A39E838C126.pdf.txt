Abstract
Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) characterize a subset of non–small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC) with extraordinary sensitivity to targeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI). A single secondary EGFR mutation,
T790M, arising in cis with the primary activating mutation,
confers acquired resistance to these drugs. However, the T790M
mutation is also detected in the absence of drug selection,
suggesting that it may provide a growth advantage. We show
here that although T790M alone has only a modest effect
on EGFR function, when combined with the characteristic
activating mutations L858R or del746–750, it results in a
dramatic enhancement of EGFR activity. The double mutants
show potent ligand-independent receptor autophosphorylation associated with altered cellular phenotypes, soft agar
colony formation, and tumorigenesis in nude mice. The significant gain-of-function properties of these double mutants may
explain their initial presence before drug selection and their
rapid selection as the single drug resistance mutation during
therapy with gefitinib/erlotinib, and suggests that they may
contribute to the adverse clinical course of TKI-resistant
NSCLC. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7319–26]

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in the United States. A subset of NSCLC,
primarily adenocarcinomas arising in nonsmokers, is defined by
the presence of mutations within the kinase domain of epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR; refs. 1–3). These somatic
mutations, which seem to arise more frequently in women and
in Asians, are correlated with dramatic clinical responses to
treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as gefitinib
and erlotinib. These mutations comprise a small number of
recurrent, gain-of-function changes clustered around the ATPbinding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain, of which the most
common are in-frame deletions (typically encompassing residues
746–750) and the missense mutation L858R (1–3). The EGFR kinase
mutants have increased ligand-activated signaling activity compared with their wild-type counterparts, particularly with respect
to downstream effectors involved in cell survival, such as AKT and

signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5; ref. 4).
Treatment of NSCLC cell lines harboring these mutations with
either gefitinib/erlotinib or transfection with small interfering RNA
targeting EGFR results in massive apoptosis, suggesting that these
cells are dependent on mutant EGFR-driven signals for survival.
This is consistent with the paradigm of ‘‘oncogene addiction’’ (5),
which has been similarly implicated in explaining the unique
sensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells to imatinib
dependent on expression of the BCR-ABL fusion protein (6).
Despite a rapid and profound response to TKI therapy, EGFRmutant NSCLC often recurs rapidly, limiting the effect on overall
survival of treated patients (7, 8). A single secondary mutation,
T790M, has been observed in approximately half of cases with
acquired resistance to gefitinib/erlotinib (9, 10). This mutation
arises at a critical ‘‘gatekeeper’’ threonine 790 residue within EGFR
(11), analogous to the threonine 315 residue that is mutated
(T315I) in Gleevec-resistant BCR-ABL (12). In vitro signaling and
modeling studies have suggested that both mutations in these
gatekeeper residues restrict binding of the drug within the ATP
cleft (9, 11, 12).
Acquired resistance to imatinib in CML may result from a
number of different somatic mutations in BCR-ABL in addition to
T315I (13–19). This mutation, however, is notorious in that it is
equally resistant to dasatinib and nilotinib, second-generation
TKIs that are effective against most imatinib-resistant mutations
(20, 21), and it has also been shown to mediate increased BCRABL tyrosine kinase activity in vitro (22). Moreover, it has recently
been shown that T315I and T315A BCR-ABL mutants have altered
P-loop phosphorylation signatures compared with wild-type,
thereby affecting their kinase function (23). In contrast, the
analogous EGFR T790M mutant does not seem to have increased
kinase activity in standard in vitro assays (9–11, 24). In addition
to being the only secondary acquired EGFR mutation identified
in gefitinib/erlotinib–resistant NSCLC, T790M is unique for a
number of reasons: First, it has been detected in some NSCLC
specimens in the absence of drug selection, including both
primary tumors (25–27) and the NSCLC-derived cell line NCIH1975 (10), where it is present in cis with a characteristic
activating EGFR mutation (7). Second, we have recently identified
a family with inherited susceptibility to the bronchoalveolar
subtype of NSCLC that is associated with transmission of a
germline T790M allele (7). In this family, T790M seems to be an
initiating genetic event, followed in the tumors by a characteristic
somatic-activating EGFR mutation, which is in cis with the
T790M mutation. Despite these data suggesting that the T790M
mutation might confer growth advantage as well as drug
resistance, studies to date have not revealed altered signaling by
T790M-EGFR compared with the wild-type receptor.

Here, we analyzed the oncogenic properties of T790M-EGFR,
either alone or in cis with characteristic activating mutations, using
stable retrovirally directed expression in untransformed NIH3T3
cells and immortalized tracheobronchial epithelial cells. T790M
alone confers a modest increase in ligand-dependent EGFR activity;
in this context, however, double mutants with T790M in cis with
either L858R or del746–750–EGFR exhibit dramatically enhanced
ligand-independent signaling and transforming phenotypes. These
observations have important implications for our understanding of
acquired resistance to TKIs in EGFR mutant NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and ectopic expression. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/
streptomycin. EGF (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 100 ng/mL
unless indicated. Gefitinib was provided by AstraZeneca, and HKI-272
was provided by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Using standard techniques, the
entire wild-type human EGFR coding sequence was subcloned into the
recombinant retroviral expression vector pRV-HygR (28). An identical
strategy was used for PCR-generated mutant constructs (EGFR T790M,
EGFR L858R, EGFR del747–753, EGFR T790M/L858R, and EGFR T790M/
del746–750). Additionally, EGFR constructs (EGFR wild-type, EGFR
T790M, EGFR L858R, EGFR del746–750, EGFR T790M/L858R, and EGFR
T790M/del746–750) were subcloned into pBABE puro for infection of
human tracheobronchial epithelial cells immortalized with the early
region of SV40 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTBE cells;
ref. 29). Retroviral infection was used to generate cells with stable ectopic
expression of EGFR, whereas lentiviral vectors were used for short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) knockdown. For retroviral infection studies, EGFR pRVHygR constructs were transfected into the 293T-derived BOSC-23
packaging cell lines (30) and EGFR pBABE puro were transfected into
the 293T-derived Phoenix packaging cell lines using LipofectAMINE 2000
(Invitrogen). NIH3T3 and hTBE cells were infected with the retroviral
supernatant twice in the presence of polybrene. Infected cells were
selected using hygromycin (700 Ag/mL for NIH3T3; Roche) or puromycin
(2.5 Ag/mL for NIH3T3 or 1 Ag/mL for hTBE; Sigma). hTBE cells were
maintained in serum-free defined medium as described (29). For lentiviral
production, HEK293 cells were transfected with the D8.2 lentiviral
construct (encoding gag, pol, rev), VSVG, and either empty pLKO.1puro
vector or the pLKO.1puro vector containing the following sequence transcribing shRNAs specific to EGFR: 5¶-GCTGGATGATAGACGCAGATA-3¶.
Virus-containing medium was then used to infect the NIH3T3 T790M/Del
stable cell line. For all experiments, uncloned drug selected pools of
infected cells were used, so as to avoid potential clonal selection bias.
Overall expression of ectopic EGFR constructs was comparable with the
level of the endogenous protein in hTBE cells, and infection efficiency was
close to 95% (NIH3T3) or 75% (hTBE) of cells.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed with ice-cold buffer [150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmol/L EDTA]
containing 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate and 1 protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche). Debris was removed by centrifugation. Clarified lysates
were boiled in gel loading buffer and separated by 10% or 4% to 15%
gradient SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose and
detected with specific antibodies. The phosphorylated EGFR Y845, Y1045,
Y1068, and Y1148 antibodies as well as the phosphorylated Src, total
Src, phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), total MAPK,
total Akt, phosphorylated STAT3 and total STAT3 antibodies were obtained
from Cell Signaling. The Ras antibody was obtained from BD Transduction
Laboratories, total EGFR antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and
both phosphorylated Akt and phospho EGFR Y992 antibodies from
Biosource. This was followed by a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibody. The bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer) followed by autoradiography.
Transformation assays. For focus formation assays, NIH3T3 cells were
transfected with 4 Ag of the pRV-HygR/EGFR or 1 Ag of the pBABE/H-

RasV12 per 6-cm dish. Two days after transfection, cells were seeded in a
10-cm dish and grown for 20 days in DMEM 5% serum. Cells were then fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. To test for colony
formation in soft agar, NIH3T3 cells were infected with pRV-HygR/EGFR
constructs or pBABEpuro/H-RasV12, and 1  104 selected cells were
suspended in DMEM containing 0.5% agarose with or without 100 ng/mL
EGF. Cells were then seeded onto a 0.5% agar base. Two to 6 weeks after the
initial seed, colony growth was assayed by counting colonies using a grid.
Experiments were done in triplicates in six-well plates. DMEM 10% serum
(0.5 mL) was supplemented to the wells twice weekly, with 100 ng/mL EGF,
1 Amol/L HKI-272, or 1 Amol/L gefitinib where indicated. hTBE cells
infected with pBABE puro/EGFR constructs were seeded at 1  105 per well
in 0.4% agarose. For tumorigenicity assays, immunodeficient mice were
housed under specific pathogen-free conditions, anesthetized with Avertin
(0.017 mL of 2.5% stock solution per gram of body weight), and then
injected s.c. with 1  106 NIH3T3 cells stably expressing EGFR or H-RasV12.
Tumor growth was measured every 2 to 3 days.

Results
Morphologic phenotype induced by T790M/L858R and
T790M/del746–750 EGFR double mutants. To assess the effect
of expressing mutant EGFRs in nontransformed cells, we infected
early-passage NIH3T3 cells with retrovirally driven constructs
encoding wild-type EGFR; EGFR with the characteristic activating
missense mutations L858R or a frequently detected deletion
mutant Del (del747–753); the drug resistance mutation T790M
alone; and double mutants with T790M in cis with L858R (T790M/
L858R) or with the deletion mutant del746–750 (T790M/Del). To
circumvent any potential clonal selection effects, hygromycin drug
selection was followed by analysis of uncloned pools of infected
cells, which had comparable expression of all constructs (Fig. 1A).
The retrovirally driven EGFR was expressed in NIH3T3 cells,
which normally express low levels of endogenous EGFR and
ErbB2 and have no detectable levels of ErbB3 and ErbB4 (31–34).
Unexpectedly, NIH3T3 cells expressing either of the T790M/L858R
or T790M/Del double mutants exhibit a striking alteration in
appearance, displaying a small, round, and light-refracting
morphology that is characteristic of Ras-transformed fibroblasts
(Fig. 1B). No such morphologic change was apparent in cells
infected with wild-type EGFR or any of the single mutations
T790M, L858R, or Del.
Cells were treated with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors
gefitinib and HKI-272. Gefitinib is a reversible EGFR inhibitor that
inhibits the activity of wild-type as well as most classic EGFR
mutants other than T790M, whereas HKI-272 binds EGFR
irreversibly and can also inhibit EGFR T790M (9, 10, 24). As
expected, gefitinib effectively inactivates the L858R and Del mutant
EGFR but is ineffective against the T790M mutation, whereas the
irreversible inhibitor HKI-272 inhibits all EGFR mutants, including
T790M (Fig. 2A). To verify that the observed morphologic
alterations were directly attributable to the expression of EGFR
double mutants, cells were treated with 1 Amol/L HKI-272. Indeed,
treatment with HKI-272 reverses the transformed morphology in
cells expressing the EGFR double mutants (Fig. 2B). As a control,
HKI-272 has no effect on the transformed morphology induced by
oncogenic H-RasV12. To further test the dependence of morphologic changes on expression of EGFR double mutants, we infected
cells with lentiviral constructs encoding shRNA targeting the EGFR
mRNA. Effective EGFR knockdown was achieved, and, again,
reversion of morphologic transformation was evident in cells
expressing the EGFR T790M/Del double mutant (Fig. 2C and D).
Thus, expression of EGFR double mutants (T790M/L858R and

T790M/Del) in NIH3T3 cells is sufficient to induce a transformed
morphology.
Modulation of EGFR kinase activity by the T790M mutation
alone and in cis with characteristic activating mutations.
Under normal growth condition, cells infected with EGFR T790M
show a significantly higher level of receptor autophosphorylation at
tyrosines 845, 992, and 1068, compared with cells infected with
wild-type EGFR (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Quantitative analysis
normalized for total EGFR levels revealed a 50% increase in
receptor autophosphorylation (P = 0.015, t test). Under comparable
conditions, the classic EGFR-activating mutation L858R mediates a
2-fold increase in basal EGFR autophosphorylation relative to wildtype (P = 0.009, t test). When present in cis within double mutant
constructs, T790M is synergistic with these classic mutations,
further increasing EGFR autophosphorylation (Fig. 3B). The effect
of both single and double mutants on EGFR autophosphorylation
was tested using a panel of phosphospecific antibodies against
various tyrosine phosphorylation sites, all showing a consistent
pattern of increased activity.
To further characterize the activity of the double-mutant EGFR,
we examined the ability of these mutants to engage downstream
signaling pathways. As previously reported, we observe that Akt
and STAT3 activity are enhanced by the classic EGFR mutants,
L858R and Del, whereas MAPK activity is not stimulated by these
mutants (Fig. 3C; ref. 4). Unexpectedly, however, the T790M double
mutants do not show significantly enhanced activation of Akt or
STAT3 compared with the single classic activating mutants despite

www.aacrjournals.org

their substantial increase in autophosphorylation. This led us to
speculate that the double mutants might have preferences for
different substrates. This is consistent with the recently published
paper by Skaggs et al. (23), which elegantly showed that the Bcr-Abl
T315I–resistant mutant, analogous to EGFR T790M, has a unique
phosphosubstrate signature compared with wild-type Bcr-Abl.
Indeed, we find that the Src kinase, a known EGFR substrate,
exhibits significantly elevated phosphorylation in cells expressing
the double mutants compared with the single-mutant alleles,
suggesting the involvement of alternative downstream signaling
pathways for these kinases harboring gatekeeper mutations.
To test whether T790M-containing EGFR double mutants exhibit
altered ligand responsiveness, we repeated these phosphorylation
studies in serum-starved cells and after administration of EGF
(Fig. 3D). As expected, cells expressing wild-type EGFR have low
levels of receptor autophosphorylation at baseline, which was
detectable only after a long exposure of the autoradiograms and
is abolished after 24 h of serum starvation. Addition of EGF to
the culture transiently induces receptor autophosphorylation.
Cells expressing the EGFR T790M mutation display higher levels
of receptor autophosphorylation under serum-starved conditions,
suggesting some degree of ligand-independent activity. Liganddependent activation of T790M-EGFR is comparable with that of
wild-type EGFR. The classic EGFR mutations, L858R and Del, show
a further increase in ligand-independent and ligand-stimulated
kinase activity. Remarkably, cells with the T790M/L858R or T790M/
Del double mutants exhibit high levels of receptor autophosphorylation despite serum starvation, and this is not further enhanced
by treatment with EGF. The ligand-independent autophosphorylation of EGFR double mutants is considerably higher than that of
maximally ligand induced wild-type EGFR or the single mutants
L858R and Del.
To further characterize the ligand dependency of the various
EGFR mutants, we did a dose response assay. As expected, EGFR
wild-type is stimulated by low concentrations of EGF and its
stimulation is enhanced at increasing concentration of ligand
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This pattern is reproduced with EGFR
T790M but with a higher level of activation than EGFR wild-type
for the same dose of ligand. The classic EGFR Del mutant showed
low levels of stimulation in the absence of ligand, and was
significantly stimulated by low concentrations of ligand. EGFR Del/
T790M mutant, however, retained high levels of autophosphorylation in the absence of ligand and this was not further increased
after EGF stimulation, reminiscent of the data shown in Fig. 3D.
Hence, T790M confers increased activity to EGFR wild-type and
cooperates with the classic activating mutations in both baseline
and serum-starved conditions to promote ligand-independent
kinase activation.
Induction of oncogenic transformation by EGFR double
mutants. The transformed morphology and ligand-independent
activity mediated by T790M/L858R and T790M/Del raise the
possibility that these EGFR double mutants also have altered
transforming properties. We first tested the effect of these mutants
on focus formation in culture. NIH3T3 cells maintained at
confluence in low serum concentrations for prolonged periods
form very few foci, as do those infected with either wild-type EGFR,
the T790M mutant, or the L858R mutant (average of 14/plate). Cells
expressing EGFR Del give rise to a slightly increased number of foci
(29 per plate). Moreover, both the T790M/L858R and T790M/Del
EGFR double mutants cause a marked increase in foci (40 and 94
per plate, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S2).

We also tested anchorage-independent growth in soft agar.
NIH3T3 cells expressing EGFR T790M/L858R or T790M/Del plated
in soft agar in the absence of exogenous EGF give rise to an average
of 28 and 69 colonies per well, respectively (Fig. 4A). Cells
expressing the single mutants L858R, Del, and T790M form very
few colonies in soft agar (<6 per well), whereas those infected with
wild-type EGFR or control vector do not grow under these
conditions. Of interest, addition of exogenous EGF yields
anchorage-independent colonies in NIH3T3 cells infected with
any of the EGFR constructs, including wild-type and single-mutant
constructs. Therefore, ligand-independent activation of the EGFR
double-mutant receptors may be a particularly important distinguishing factor as it relates to oncogenic transformation.
To test whether EGFR double mutants are transforming in a
more physiologically relevant model, EGFR mutant constructs
were stably infected in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells
immortalized with the early region of SV40 and human telomerase
reverse transcriptase (29). Similar to our results in NIH3T3 cells,
hTBE cells expressing EGFR T790M/L858R or T790M/Del plated in
soft agar give rise to a significant number of colonies, whereas cells
expressing the single activating mutants are only weakly transforming (Fig. 4B). Analysis of EGFR expression level in these stable
cells shows low levels of ectopic expression comparable with levels
of endogenous EGFR expressed by the parental cell line. Thus, our
observations are consistent with the physiologic effect of
heterozygous EGFR mutants present in NSCLC.
We have shown that the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor HKI272 can inhibit EGFR double-mutant activity, as measured by
autophosphorylation and cell morphology (Fig. 2). We therefore
wanted to confirm that the transforming activity of EGFR double
mutants could be reversed by HKI-272. Indeed, HKI-272 treatment of

NIH3T3 cells expressing EGFR T790M/L858R or T790M/Del
prevents anchorage-independent growth (Supplementary Fig. S3).
As expected, gefinitib treatment of these EGFR double mutant–
expressing cells does not have any significant effect on soft-agar
colony formation because the T790M double mutants are resistant
to this drug.
To test whether EGFR double mutants exhibit increased
oncogenic activity in vivo, NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the
various EGFR constructs were injected s.c. into nude mice. As
controls, we established that vector-infected cells are not tumorigenic, whereas cells infected with H-RasV12 form tumors within
1 week after injection. NIH3T3 cells expressing T790M/Del and
T790M/L858R give rise to large tumors within 2 weeks (six of six
inoculations for each construct), whereas cells expressing the
L858R or Del mutations leads to comparable tumors only after
3 weeks (six of six and four of four inoculations for each construct,
respectively). Cells expressing the T790M mutation alone form
small tumors in only two of six inoculations; cells infected with
wild-type EGFR do not give rise to tumors (Fig. 4C and D).
Sequencing of EGFR coding regions from tumor tissue showed no
acquired mutations during the process of tumor formation (data
not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the EGFR
double mutants T790M/L858R and T790M/Del have increased
oncogenic activity in vitro and in vivo relative to wild-type EGFR
and EGFR single mutants.

Discussion
We have shown potent transforming activity by EGFR
harboring two mutations in cis, including the only reported

classic drug-sensitizing mutations L858R or del746–750. The double
EGFR mutants mediate significantly increased ligand-independent
activation of the receptor, compared with any of the single mutations. Taken together, these observations suggest that T790M might
be particularly advantageous to tumor cells after drug selection as
it confers both drug resistance and gain of transforming activity.
The modest increase in EGFR signaling mediated by T790M
alone may explain the observation that this drug resistance
mutation has been reported as a germ line mutation in a family
with inherited susceptibility to lung cancer (7). The relatively weak
increase in signaling associated with T790M-EGFR may explain
why it is ‘‘tolerated’’ in the germ line. Our tumorigenesis studies in
mice further point to a modest oncogenic effect of T790M alone.
These results are consistent with T790M mediating susceptibility to
NSCLC in humans only at late onset. Of note, previous studies
using transient overexpression have not succeeded in demonstrating clear functional distinctions between wild-type EGFR and the
T790M mutation (9–11) either in terms of receptor signaling or
tumorigenesis, pointing to the potential advantage of using stable
retrovirally driven expression in nontumorigenic cells.
The development of tumors in patients with a germ line T790M
mutation is typically accompanied by somatic acquisition of a
second, classic activating EGFR mutation in cis (7). Similarly, the
acquisition of gefitinib/erlotinib resistance in NSCLC patients
whose tumor harbors an initial drug-sensitizing EGFR mutation is

www.aacrjournals.org

associated with the T790M mutation arising in cis with the initial
mutation. In rare cases, such double mutants in EGFR have also
been observed in untreated NSCLC, although use of allele-specific
PCR is increasingly revealing the presence of the T790M mutation
at low frequency in primary tumors before treatment (10, 25, 26).
Thus, genetic evidence strongly points to specific functional
properties of these double mutants, in addition to their reported
role in gefitinib/erlotinib resistance.
The presence of T790M in cis with either of the classic activating
mutations L858R or del746–750 has a profound effect on receptor
activity. Most significant is the appearance of potent ligandindependent receptor activation. Under conditions tested here,
ligand-independent activation is modest with single classic kinase
mutations of EGFR. This difference is consistent with the
observation that activating EGFR mutations are transforming in
the presence of ligand, whereas the double mutants give rise to soft
agar colonies in the absence of exogenous EGF. The degree of
ligand dependence of the classic activating mutants L858R and Del
may vary under experimental conditions (35–38). Indeed, we have
found that the classic activating EGFR single mutants show varying
degrees of transformation depending on expression levels (data not
shown). Our approach appears particularly valuable in distinguishing between EGFR double mutants and EGFR single mutants.
Additional work is needed to determine the mechanism by which
T790M can confer ligand-independent activity to EGFR. Increased

affinity of the mutant EGFR tyrosine kinase domain for the sites of
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (reduced K m) or increased catalytic
activity of the mutant EGFR kinase domain (increased k cat) are
possible explanations that should be pursued further. Additionally,
further structural studies will be required to determine how the
combination of mutations within the ATP pocket may modulate
catalytic activity of the receptor. In this respect, it is of interest
that the EGFR T790M/Del mutant consistently shows increased
activity compared with the T790M/L858R mutant, as measured by
morphologic transformation, soft agar colony formation, and
tumorigenicity assays. Accumulating clinical findings are pointing
to distinct biological properties for the common activating
mutations of EGFR, L858R, and in-frame deletion variants, which
may well also have different properties when combined with
T790M. Of note, EGFR double mutants appear to signal via
alternative downstream pathways compared with wild-type and
classic mutant EGFR. Similarly, a recent report from Skaggs et al.

(23) has shown that Bcr-Abl T315I, the analogous mutation to
EGFR T790M, has a unique phosphosubstrate signature compared
with wild-type Bcr-Abl.
The potent transforming properties of EGFR double mutants
raise an interesting paradox. Their apparent oncogenic effect
readily explains why these mutations are detectable in cases that
have not been treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib. The
presence of some tumor cells expressing these double mutants
even before treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may explain
the relatively rapid emergence of drug resistance, and also the fact
that T790M is the sole mutation associated with acquired drug
resistance. This is reminiscent of cases of imatinib-resistant BcrAbl mutants present in untreated patients (18), suggesting a global
mechanism of resistance by clonal selection of preexisting kinase
domain mutations. On the other hand, such a potent proliferative
advantage to cells expressing the T790M double mutants would
suggest that these cells should have become prevalent in untreated

EGFR T790M Oncogenic Activity

Figure 5. Model for T790M selection in
EGFR mutant-expressing lung cancer.
A somatic activating mutation at EGFR
(e.g., L858R) is sufficient to initiate the
formation of NSCLC (40, 41). A small
proportion of cells acquire ligandindependent oncogenic potential by the
secondary mutation T790M in cis with the
primary mutation. Treatment with the
TKIs gefitinib or erlotinib results in killing of
cells expressing EGFR L858R, but has no
effect on those expressing EGFR T790M/
L858R. Drug treatment thus enriches for
preexisting NSCLC cell populations
expressing the highly transforming EGFR
double mutant, resulting in a more
aggressive tumor.

NSCLC, rather than constituting a small subset of the tumor
population. It is possible that the frequency of T790M mutations in
NSCLC is underestimated by virtue of ‘‘allelic dilution.’’ In the
subset of tumors with amplified mutant EGFR, a single doublemutant allele may be below a level of detectability for standard
sequencing assays. This hypothesis is strengthened by a recent
publication that shows that a T790M mutation present in only a
small fraction of amplified EGFR alleles, which goes undetected in
sequencing assays, is sufficient to confer resistance to gefitinib
in vitro (39). Alternatively, because most EGFR mutant NSCLC do
not have amplification of the mutant allele, the frequency of T790M
double mutants may be driven by its signaling properties.
Considering the weak ligand-independent signaling mediated by
the classic EGFR kinase mutations, versus the strong ligandindependent effect of the T790M double mutants, we speculate
that the former may be sufficient to drive cellular proliferation in
tissues where ligand is abundant, whereas the T790M mutation
may provide a selective growth advantage in tissues where such
ligands are not present. Tissue context may therefore regulate the
relative abundance of single versus double mutants in the absence
of drug selection. Following such selection, however, the emergence
of T790M double mutants may have important implications
not only for drug sensitivity but also for tumor aggressiveness
(see model in Fig. 5).

Most cases of NSCLC with activating EGFR kinase mutations
have a dramatic initial response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
followed by relatively rapid tumor regrowth. The data presented
here suggest that these recurrent, T790M double-mutant, EGFRdriven tumors might be more aggressive than the primary, singlemutant tumors, thereby contributing to the modest survival benefit
in these patients (7, 8). This hypothesis suggests that secondgeneration EGFR kinase inhibitors that retain activity against the
T790M double-mutant receptors, such as irreversible inhibitors,
may prove to have clinical utility.
