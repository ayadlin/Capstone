ABSTRACT:
Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is incurable for most patients. Since
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been suggested as a crucial modulator
of tumor biology, we aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of mTOR targeting for
CRC therapy. To this purpose, we analyzed mTOR expression and the effect of mTOR
inhibition in cancer stem-like cells isolated from three human metastatic CRCs
(CoCSCs).
CoCSCs exhibited a strong mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) expression, and a rare
expression of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This latter correlated with differentiation,
being expressed in CoCSC-derived xenografts. We indicate Serum/glucocorticoidregulated kinase 1 (SGK1) as the possible main mTORC2 effector in CoCSCs, as
highlighted by the negative effect on cancer properties following its knockdown.
mTOR inhibitors affected CoCSCs differently, resulting in proliferation, autophagy as
well as apoptosis induction. The apoptosis-inducing mTOR inhibitor Torin-1 hindered
growth, motility, invasion, and survival of CoCSCs in vitro, and suppressed tumor
growth in vivo with a concomitant reduction in vessel formation. Torin-1 also affected
the expression of markers for cell proliferation, angio-/lympho-genesis, and stemness
in vivo, including Ki67, DLL1, DLL4, Notch, Lgr5, and CD44. Importantly, Torin-1 did
not affect the survival of normal colon stem cells in vivo, suggesting its selectivity
towards cancer cells. Thus, we propose Torin-1 as a powerful drug candidate for
metastatic CRC therapy.

INTRODUCTION

course of mTOR-oriented drug discovery. First, the fact
that mTOR exists in two distinct complexes: mTORC1
containing Raptor, and mTORC2 containing Rictor [3].
Second, the discovery that Rapamycin (the first mTOR
inhibitor identified) exerts an incomplete inhibition of
mTORC1 and is inactive against mTORC2 under shortterm conditions [4]. Third, the existence of negative
feedback loops linking mTOR to other pathways. Akt can
phosphorylate mTOR in mTORC1, consequently leading
to phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1
(S6K1) and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), mediators
of protein translation and cell growth [5]. mTORC1activated S6K1 phosphorylates Rictor and/or Insulin
receptor substrate (IRS)-1, thus inhibiting mTORC2 and
phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling,

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading
cause of cancer death in the United States [1]. Despite
new treatment options developed in the last decade, the
prognosis for patients with advanced or recurrent CRC
remains poor.
The serine/threonine kinase mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) has been suggested as a crucial
modulator of tumor cell growth and proliferation, and
therefore a potential target for anticancer therapy [2].
Unfortunately, drug development against mTOR started
when knowledge of its function was very preliminary,
resulting in contradictory data and unsuccessful clinical
trials. Several breakthroughs have recently changed the

respectively [6, 7]. More recent findings indicate that
mTORC1 also phosphorylates Growth Factor Receptor
Bound Protein 10 (Grb10), leading to accumulation of
Grb10 and negative feedback inhibition of PI3K and
Microtubule-associated protein kinase/Extracellularsignal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway [8].
mTORC2 plays an important role in cell survival,
metabolism, proliferation and cytoskeleton organization,
as it phosphorylates Protein Kinase Cα (PKCα), SGK1,
as well as Akt, allowing for its complete activation [3,
9-11]. Documented pro-survival rather than anticancer
effects of Rapamycin likely resulted from disruption of the
mTORC1-dependent negative feedback loop to mTORC2
and IRS-1/PI3K. This awareness pushed for development
of a new generation of inhibitors, which compete with ATP
in the catalytic site of mTOR, and inhibit both complexes
[12]. Unfortunately, the effects of the so-called mTOR
kinase inhibitors (mTorKIs) have been poorly investigated.
Studies in Apc∆716 mice, a mouse model of familial
adenomatous polyposis, sustained the basis of mTORC1targeted drug development for therapy and prevention of
colon polyps and cancers [13, 14]. However, blocking
a specific pathway may disrupt the balance between
signaling pathways and enhance oncogenic signals. In that
regard, in parallel with its cytostatic effect, Rapamycin
strongly increased MAPK kinase (MEK)/ERK activity,
resulting in the appearance of a spindle morphology
and higher invasiveness of K-Ras-transformed intestinal
epithelial cells (IECs) [15]. This indicated the need for new
drugs able to overcome the relief of feedback inhibition of
pro-survival, pro-invasive and pro-metastatic pathways.
Besides mTORC1, mTORC2 is overexpressed in CRC
and plays an important role in cancer biology [16]. Recent
studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the dual kinase
inhibitors NVP-BEZ235 and pp242 in CRC cell linederived xenografts [17, 18]. Nevertheless, a remarkable
intrinsic resistance of a large proportion of CRC cell lines
to mTorKIs, including the above-mentioned compounds,
was also described, warranting further studies [19].
With the formulation of the cancer stem cell (CSC)
hypothesis in tumors including CRC, it has become
clear that successful tumor eradication requires the
depletion of a population of precursor/progenitor cells
with indefinite self-renewal capacity, chemotherapy
resistance, and metastatic ability [20, 21]. Despite this, to
our knowledge, only one study investigated the effects of
mTOR inhibitors in cancer stem-like cells so far. mTOR
signaling was shown to be activated in colorectal cell linederived spheres in serum-free medium [22]. Treatment
with Rapamycin and pp242 diminished sphere-forming
capacity as well as ALDH1 activity. However, only pp242
suppressed the enrichment of ALDH+ cells induced by
chemotherapy, thus highlighting an essential role of the
mTORC2 signaling in the maintenance of the CRC stemlike phenotype. Although this study further confirmed the
importance of mTOR signaling in CRC, the authors did
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

not perform sufficient functional experiments to assess
the effect of mTOR inhibition on biological properties
and tumorigenic potentials of CRC stem-like cells.
Moreover, the existence of a controversy in the literature
as to whether ALDH+ cells isolated from cancer cell
lines can serve as in vitro model for CSC study, further
indicates the need to study the effect of mTOR inhibition
using alternative methods to identify and characterize
CSCs. Multiple cell-surface proteins have been proposed
as potential candidate markers for colon stem-like cells
(CoCSCs), and our in vitro system efficiently enriches
for these cells [23]. Here, we first analyzed CoCSCs for
expression of major mTORC1/2 pathway components.
We then tested different mTOR inhibitors, either alone
or in combination with standard chemotherapy. Through
these studies, we identified Torin-1 as the most powerful
inhibitor among those examined for CRC therapy.

RESULTS
mTORC2 likely regulates physiology of both
colon cancer progenitor and mature cells,
while mTORC1 likely contributes to CoCSC
differentiation.
Although several mTOR pathway components
have been investigated in a number of cancers including
those of the colon [24], to our knowledge, no study
investigating their expression in patient-derived CoCSCs
has been reported so far. By immunofluorescence, we
therefore analyzed the expression of Akt Ser473, mTOR
Ser2448, mTOR Ser2481, SGK1 Ser422, and PKCα
Ser657, in CoCSCs derived from three human metastatic
CRCs (Tu12, Tu21, and Tu22 cells) [23]. Since these cells
were grown on a rodent feeder layer, co-staining with an
anti-HLA antibody was necessary to discriminate human
(CRC) versus non-human (stroma) cells. Comparable
results were obtained in all three cell lines tested. CoCSCs
exhibited unexpectedly low Akt signaling but mTORC2
activation, as revealed by strong phosphorylation in
all the cells of mTOR at Ser2481 and of its effectors
SGK1 and PKCα, at residues previously reported to be
modified following mTORC2 activation (Figure 1A)
[2]. A rare positivity for mTOR Ser2448 (indicative of
mTORC1 activation status [2]) and infrequency of Thr389
phosphorylation of the p70S6K1 mTORC1 effector
(data not shown) were also observed, indicating that as
compared to mTORC1, mTORC2 might play a much more
important role in regulating CoCSC physiology. Moreover,
mTOR Ser2481 and Rictor co-localized, further indicating
mTORC2 activation in our system. Interestingly, mTOR
Ser2481 co-localized with γ-tubulin in centrosomes, thus
suggesting a potential role for mTORC2 in the control
of CoCSC proliferation (Figure 1B). While mTOR

we hypothesized that this could also have been the case
with CoCSCs. To prove this hypothesis, we investigated
whether SGK1 knockdown could affect cancer
properties. Tu12, Tu21 and Tu22 cells were purified from
contaminating feeder cells, grown on plastic, and infected
with copGFP control, control shRNA or SGK1 shRNA
lentiviral particles (Figure 2A). RT-PCR analysis revealed
a significant decrease in SGK1 mRNA levels 72h after
transfection (Figure 2B, left), while immunofluorescence
analysis highlighted a strong decrease of SGK1
phosphorylation following puromycin selection (Figure
2B, right). Decreased clonogenicity (Figure 2C), invasive
ability (p=0.0006) (Figure 2D), and a 2-5fold increased
Oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis (Figure 2E-F), were also
observed following SGK1 knockdown. Thus, rather
than Akt, SGK1 could be the main mTORC2 effector in
CoCSCs.

Ser2448 and p70S6K1 Thr389 were barely detectable in
vitro, they were clearly expressed in vivo, together with
mTOR Ser2481 and SGK1 Ser422 (Figure 1C). Because
CoCSC differentiation has been previously observed
after transplantation in immunodeficient mice [23], our
immunostaining suggests a possible regulatory role of
mTORC1 in CoCSC differentiation and of mTORC2 in
the physiology of both stem/progenitor and mature tumor
cells.

SGK1 facilitates CoCSC growth and drug
resistance.
The finding that CoCSCs expressed low levels of
activated Akt might be explained in light of the recent
observation that activated Akt in CRC correlates with
low stage and good prognosis, [25] and this was not our
case, since we were analyzing cells isolated from CRC
metastases to the liver [23]. The fact that despite low
Akt activation, CoCSCs showed mTORC2 activation,
led us to hypothesize that Akt could not have been a
major mTORC2 effector in our system. SGK1 is the
main mTORC2 effector in yeast and worms [26]; thus,

mTOR inhibitors differently affect CoCSC
viability.
Since mTORC2 activation characterized CoCSCs
in vitro, we compared the effects of various mTorKIs

first-generation mTOR inhibitors (Rapamycin and
Temsirolimus) on the three CoCSC lines previously
examined. Feeder cell-depleted CoCSCs were treated
with vehicle or a serial dilution (0.001-10µM) of the
above-mentioned compounds for 72h. Even high drug
concentrations were often not sufficient to affect cell
viability (Figure 3A, left). Interestingly, mTOR inhibitors
sometimes induced cell proliferation. Only Torin-1

the accumulation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles inside

that pp242 induced autophagy, as indicated by acidic
vesicular organelle (AVO) formation, changes in the

diffuse cytosolic to a punctate distribution (Supplementary

(Supplementary Figure 1B). A late-stage inhibitor
of autophagolysosome formation, Bafilomycin A1,
effectively blocked the accumulation of pp242-induced
AVOs, but did not further sensitize cells to the effects of
mTOR inhibition (Supplementary Figure 1C). In contrast,
autophagy inhibition alleviated pp242 cytostatic effects,
as proliferative rates of treated cells returned to basal
levels (data not shown). Moreover, a transient and weak
S phase cell cycle arrest accompanied pp242-induced
autophagy (Supplementary Figure 1D), further indicating
that autophagy was not delaying apoptotic cell death, but
effectively rescuing cells from death.
As expected, both Rapamycin and Temsirolimus
did not affect mTOR Ser2481 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure 2A) and low Rapamycin doses
(10nM) induced Akt feedback activation (Supplementary
Figure 2B). p70S6K1 Thr389 levels were very low in
CoCSCs and not altered by Rapamycin exposure up to
1µM. Conversely, Rapamycin markedly decreased Grb10

protein abundance (Supplementary Figure 2C), suggesting
that the relief of Grb10-mediated negative feedback
inhibition of PI3K may have sometimes induced CoCSCs
to activate Akt and proliferate.
We then aimed at testing mTOR inhibitors in
combination with standard chemotherapy. Tu12, Tu21
and Tu22 cells were treated with 5µM Oxaliplatin or
100µM 5-Fluorouracil alone or in combination with
10µM Rapamycin, Temsirolimus or WYE-354 for 72h.
The mTOR inhibitors tested did not show additive or
synergistic effects in combination with chemotherapeutics
(Figure 3B). Rather, Temsirolimus rescued Oxaliplatintreated Tu22 cells (p=0.0075), while WYE-354 rescued
Oxaliplatin-treated Tu12 (p=0.04) and Tu22 cells
(p=0.008), as well as 5-Fluorouracil-treated Tu12 cells
(p=0.03). Thus, mTOR inhibitors may have a beneficial
role by protecting cells against pro-apoptotic insults.
There was no observed benefit of combining Ku-0063794,
Torin-1 or pp242 with chemotherapeutics (data not

(Figure 4C). Following 72h of treatment, all the cells were
apoptotic (Figure 4D). Importantly, 5µM Torin-1 treatment
for 15h resulted in sub-G1 cell accumulation (Figure 4E),
and appearance of single Annexin V+ cells (Figure 4F),
both indicative of apoptosis induction.
Emergence of resistant clones represents a main
problem of current therapies. To understand whether
CoCSCs could develop Torin-1 resistance, Torin-1
resistant Tu12, Tu21, and Tu22 cells were generated, as
depicted in Supplementary Figure 3A. Cells could now
survive 5µM Torin-1, but they were no longer able to
extensively proliferate in vitro (Supplementary Figure 3B).
S.c. injection of Torin-1 resistant cells into mice (n=7) did
not generate palpable tumors during a 7-wk observation

shown). Taken together, Torin-1 as a single agent, is the
most powerful inhibitor among those examined for CRC
therapy, as it efficiently suppresses tumor growth in vitro.

Torin-1 triggers CoCSC apoptosis.
Various techniques were used to determine whether
Torin-1 induced apoptosis. 5µM Torin-1 treatment for
15h suppressed mTOR Ser2481 phosphorylation (Figure
4A) and induced apoptosis, as indicated by caspase-3
activation, monitored by both immunofluorescence and
flow cytometry analysis (Figure 4B), and appearance of
TUNEL-positive half moon shaped and fragmented nuclei

examination of skinned mice revealed two mice had
formed very small tumors. Thus, CoCSC cultures that
have been subjected to a prolonged, continuous, multistep
selection with Torin-1 contain a strikingly reduced tumorinitiating cell population, thus encouraging Torin-1
potential use for CRC therapy.

Despite the first wave of enthusiasm surrounding
the CSC field, no consensus has emerged so far about

described as a unique marker for immature intestinal
cells, CD133 was later subject of huge controversy [27].
Conversely, the combined expression of CD326high/CD44+/
CD166+ was suggested as being more robust for CoCSC
isolation [28]. Both CD24+/CD29+ and CD24+/CD49f+
signature have been suggested to characterize putative
mammary stem/progenitor cells [29]. Interestingly,
we found colony-forming unit (CFU) frequencies of
CD326+/CD24+/CD49f+/CD29+ and CD326+/CD44+/
CD166+ CRC subpopulations to be very similar. For this
reason, we chose these two subpopulations within Tu12
cells to further confirm Torin-1 anti-CoCSC activity.
Particularly, we performed limiting dilution analysis,
migration, and invasion assays, in the presence or absence
of 1µM Rapamycin, WYE-354, or Torin-1. While CFU
frequencies among Control, Rapamycin-, and WYE-354treated cells were similar, CFU frequencies following
Torin-1 treatment were significantly decreased (Figure 5A,
upper right panel). However, cells exposed to Rapamycin
or WYE-354 were less confluent than control cells, and

Torin-1-treated cells generated very small colonies (Figure
5A, lower right panel). Compared to control cells, more
cells migrated through the gap at 48h and invaded the
Matrigel layer at 72h under Rapamycin exposure (p=0.035
for CD326+/CD24+/CD49f+/CD29+, and 0.0056 for
CD326+/CD44+/CD166+ cells) (Figure 5B-C). Moreover,
Rapamycin caused some cells to cross the porous
membrane and adhere to the bottom chamber (Figure 5C,
right). In contrast, control cell were completely unable
to cross the membrane under experimental conditions.
Although 72h WYE-354 treatment did not affect Tu12 cell
viability (Figure 3A, left), it slightly reduced migration,
but not invasion of both subpopulations (p=0.37 and
p=0.36, respectively) (Figure 5B-C). Conversely, Torin-1
strongly inhibited both migration and invasion of the
selected subpopulations (p=0.024 and 0.009, respectively),
and activated apoptosis as evidenced by increased caspase
3/7 activity and morphological changes (Figure 5B-D),
confirming its anti-CSC activity.

marker Ki67, the Notch pathway members involved
in angiogenesis DLL4 and Notch1 [30], and the CSC
surface marker CD44 were significantly reduced in both
Tu12 and Tu22 treated tumors. No changes in the mRNA
levels of the goblet cell differentiation marker Muc2, the
Notch effector Hes1, and the Polycomb member Bmi1
were observed. The enterocyte differentiation marker
Villin, the Notch pathway component DLL1, and the crypt
stem cell marker Lgr5 were decreased in Tu22, but not
in Tu12 tumors, following treatment. Anti-CSC therapy
is expected to promote differentiation; the reduction in
Villin levels may therefore seem paradoxical. However,
a previously unrecognized function of Villin in IEC
survival was reported [31], indicating that Torin-1 might
favor apoptosis by reducing Villin levels. A decrease in
mTOR Ser2481, and an increase in CC3 and fibrotic tissue
(Azan Mallory, A.M.) were observed in treated versus
control tumors (Figure 7B). In accordance with molecular
analysis, no changes in goblet cell numbers were found,
as investigated by Muc2 and Alcian Blue (A.B.) stainings
(Figure 7B). Importantly, treated tumors contained fewer
blood vessels, as examined through CD31 staining (Figure
7B). Interestingly, Podoplanin expression characterized
H&E

both lymphatic vessels and tumor cells at the invasive
front of control tumors, while no positivity was observed
in treated tumors (Figure 7C). Podoplanin+ vessels were
CD31-. Podoplanin+ cells located outside vessels were
human in origin, although HLA expression was dispersed
throughout their cytoplasm. This is not surprising since
tumor cells often down-regulate HLA antigens surface
expression to escape immunological attack. Podoplanin+
cells exhibited round morphology typical of amoeboid
motility and were CD44-. Loss of CD44 expression in
invaded area is a good indicator of lymph-node metastasis
in CRC [32]. Thus, while control tumors comprised cells
with high metastatic potential, cells in treated tumors were
less prone to migrate to distant sites.
Since in vitro cultured tumor cells might not
maintain the exact properties of the primary tumor, by
acquisition of additional gene alterations, we aimed at
assessing Torin-1 effects on xenografts obtained from
injection of freshly isolated metastatic CRC cells. After
5 months from injection, 6 out of 10 tumors had formed.
Mice were therefore divided in two groups, and treated
with 20mg/Kg Torin-1 or vehicle every day up to 12
days (parental tumor was confirmed for mTOR pathway

cancers without great success. Of the huge list of mTOR
inhibitors developed, only Temsirolimus and Everolimus
have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
advanced renal cell carcinoma [37]. Nevertheless, the
role of mTOR inhibitors in cancer therapy continues to
evolve, as new compounds are synthetized. Despite this,
data comparing the effects of distinct mTOR inhibitors on
CSCs are incomplete.
Here, we first analyzed metastatic CRC cells with
the properties of intestinal stem cells as well as tumorinitiating cells for mTOR activation. We found mTOR
complexes to be differently expressed in these cells,
concluding that mTORC2 might be involved in the
maintenance of the cancer stem-like phenotype, while
mTORC1 might be involved in CoCSC maturation. This
is in agreement with previous studies showing a role for
mTORC1 in driving the differentiation of normal and
cancer stem/progenitor cells [38-41].
CoCSCs expressed low levels of Akt Ser473,
indicating that this kinase could not have been a major
mTORC2 effector in our system. We indicated SGK1
as the possible main mTORC2 effector in CoCSCs, as
highlighted by the negative effect on cancer properties
following its knockdown. Akt hypophosphorylation and
dependence of SGK family members for viability are
known to occur most frequently in the context of wildtype Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and helical
PI3K alpha catalytic subunit kinase domain (PIK3CA)
mutations [42]. Future studies will be conducted to confirm
whether this genetic signature can predict resistance
or sensitivity of CoCSCs to the different mTorKIs here
studied. Unfortunately, the prognostic and predictive value
of common mutations in patients with colon cancer is
controversial, due to bias in research settings [43]. In our
opinion, mTorKI resistance might also occur through less
well-studied but equally important epigenetic mechanisms
[44].
We therefore analyzed the effects of six mTOR
inhibitors, including Torin-1, a highly potent and selective
mTorKI [45]. Of the examined compounds, Torin-1
proved the most powerful inhibitor, suppressing CoCSC
growth both in vitro and in vivo.
mTOR inhibitors can relieve negative feedbacks,
resulting in strengthened oncogenic signals. This
happened under Rapamycin exposure, which drove cells
towards a pro-metastatic phenotype, confirming the notion
that Rapamycin can have pro-tumor effects. Nevertheless,
despite its role in activating oncogenetic pathways,
Rapamycin has also been considered a tumor-preventive
agent since it delays carcinogenesis in tumor-prone p53+/and p53-/-mice, most likely by slowing down the process
of aging [46, 47]. mTOR inhibitors can have a doubleedged sword by activating autophagy, and autophagy itself
has a double-edged sword in cancer by the promotion of
metabolically stressed tumor cell survival. Indeed, pp242
protected CoCSCs from the effects of mTOR inhibition

activation before beginning Torin-1 treatment, data not
shown). Torin-1-treated tumors grew slower than control
tumors (data not shown). Importantly, CD326 expression
was reduced after treatment, as assessed by flow cytometry
analysis on freshly isolated cells (data not shown). CD326
is one of the first and prominent immunotherapeutic
targets in cancer therapy due to its frequent and high-level
expression on most carcinomas of various origins. It can
abrogate E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion thereby
promoting metastasis [33], and can support proliferation
by enhancing Wnt signaling [34]. CD326+ cells from both
groups were sorted and plated on stroma feeder layer.
CD326+ cells isolated from vehicle-treated xenografts
generated a higher number of colonies than CD326+ cells
isolated from Torin-1-treated xenografts, and colonies
were significantly bigger (Figure 7D). All these data
support the potential of further development of Torin-1 as
therapeutic for the treatment of CRC.

Torin-1 does not affect the survival of normal
colon stem cells in vivo.
Because normal stem cells and CSCs share many
traits, it seems reasonable to think that any therapy
targeting CSCs may also destroy healthy tissues [35].
Given our recent finding that the mouse lymph node can
be used as an in vivo organ factory to build up complex
organ structures [36], we aimed at assessing the in vivo
toxicity of Torin-1 against normal colon stem cells by
recapitulating colon organ inside the mouse lymph
node. To this purpose, we used human fetal intestinal
epithelial cells, thought to be enriched in normal stem
cells (Figure 8, upper panel). Following 3 weeks from cell
transplantation, mice were treated with vehicle or 20mg/
Kg Torin-1 once a day for 12 days. Tridimensional crypts
could be observed in lymph nodes of both untreated and
treated mice, to the same extent (Figure 8, lower panel).
Thus, Torin-1 did not affect the survival of normal colon
stem cells in vivo, suggesting its selectivity towards cancer
cells.

DISCUSSION
Although during the last decades in vivo preclinical
studies revealed the antitumor effect of several drugs
against CRC, most patients experience a tumor recurrence.
The main explanation for such a dismal prognosis is that
common drugs leave behind CoCSCs, whose drug-induced
positive selection renders tumors more aggressive. As
cancer’s Achilles’ heel, CSCs have been intensively studied
to develop more effective therapies. Because it plays such
a crucial role in cancer biology, mTOR has emerged as
a potential target for drug development. Several mTOR
inhibitors, including Rapamycin, have already gone
through clinical trials as single agents for treating various

through autophagy activation, warranting considerable
attention on newly developed inhibitors. The goal of
any therapeutic strategy is to trigger CSC apoptosis, and
Torin-1 successfully achieved this aim both in vitro and in
vivo. It is possible that higher Torin-1 concentrations could
increase antitumor response in vivo. However, 20mg/
Kg Torin-1 was sufficient to hinder CoCSC expansion,
angio-/lympho-genesis, and invasion in vivo. Importantly,
Torin-1-resistant CoCSCs exhibited much reduced
tumorigenicity or were even non-tumorigenic. Moreover,
Torin-1 did not affect the survival of normal colon stem/
progenitor cells in vivo, thus encouraging its potential
use for metastatic CRC therapy. Recently, Torin-2, which
has better pharmacokinetic properties and an improved
synthetic route than Torin-1 has been synthetized [48].
Although to our knowledge no studies have been reported
so far to elucidate its effectiveness in cancer, we do not
exclude it could also be used to successfully treat CRC.
Inappropriate activation of PI3K signaling is one of the
most common features of CRC. Several studies have
shown that inhibition at multiple levels of the PI3K
pathway results in FOXO-dependent feedback reactivation
of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which, in
turn, limit the sustained inhibition of this pathway [49].
This suggests that if used as single agents, PI3K pathway
inhibitors may have limited clinical activity. Conversely,
dual inhibition of PI3K and mTORC1/2 signaling induced
tumor regression in several in vivo human tumor xenograft
models, and might show greater efficacy than mTorKIs at
depleting CoCSCs [50].

Tumor tissues were minced into small fragments
with scalpels and then digested using a two-step
collagenase method. Freshly isolated cells from
primary tumors or CoCSCs (5 x 105) were suspended in
HBSS:Matrigel (1:1) and injected s.c. into both flanks
of 5-week-old BALB/c nude mice (Charles River, n=5

N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone/40% PEG400/40% water [45],
or vehicle was delivered by i.p. injection once daily for
12 days after the tumor was established. Tumors were
measured every day using a caliper and tumor volumes
calculated according to the formula V=π/6×(larger
diameter)×(smaller diameter)2. At the end of the treatment
mice were killed by CO2 euthanasia. Xenografted tumors
were excised, weighed, photographed, fixed in buffered
formalin, and embedded in paraffin for histological and
immunohistochemical examination, or stored in RNA later
(Qiagen) prior to RNA isolation, or subjected to flowcytometric analysis.

For lymph node transplantation, recipient mice
(BALB/c nude, n=12) were anesthetized with 1–3%
isoflurane. A small incision was made in the abdomen to
expose jejunal lymph nodes. A 25μL gas-tight removable

to seal the opening. The wound was then closed with
surgical sutures. Ketoprofen (2 mg/kg, IM) treatment for
postoperative pain relief was initiated right after surgery
and continued for 2 additional consecutive days. Three
weeks later, mice were divided in two groups; one group
received i.p. injection of 20mg/Kg Torin-1 once a day for
12 days (n=7); the other group received vehicle (n=5). At
the end of Torin-1 treatment, all mice were euthanized,
their lymph nodes were collected, fixed 2 hours in 4%
PFA, and embedded in paraffin for analysis. Sections
were stained with H&E or Muc2 antibody (antibody used
