ABSTRACT:
Tumor development not only destroys the homeostasis of local tissues but also
the whole body, and thus the tumor cells have to face the body’s defense system, a
shortage of nutrition and oxygen, and chemotherapeutic drug treatment. In response
to these stresses, tumor cells often alter gene expression and microRNA levels to
facilitate survival. We have demonstrated that glioblastoma cells deprived of nutrition
or treated with chemotherapeutics drugs expressed increased levels of miR-17.
Ectopic transfection of miR-17 prolonged glioblastoma cell survival when the cells
were deprived with nutrition or treated with chemotherapeutic drugs. Expression
of miR-17 also promoted cell motility, invasion, and tube-like structure formation.
We found that these phenotypes were the results of miR-17 targeting PTEN. As a
consequence, HIF1α and VEGF were up-regulated. Ectopic expression of miR-17
was found to facilitate enrichment of stem-like tumor cells, since the cells became
drug-resistant, showed increased capacity to form colonies and neurospheres, and
expressed higher levels of CD133, a phenotype similar to ectopic expression of HIF1α.
To further confirm the phenotypic property of stem cells, we demonstrated that
glioblastoma cells transfected with miR-17 proliferated slower in different nutritional
conditions by facilitating more cells staying in the G1 phase than the control cells.
Finally, we demonstrated that miR-17 could repress MDM2 levels, resulting in
decreased cell proliferation and drug-resistance. Our results added a new layer of
functional mechanism for the well-studied miRNA miR-17.

INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs are a group of small non-coding RNAs
that are transcribed in the nuclei and transported to the
cytoplasm, each precursor miRNA can be processed
to produce a mature miRNA and a passenger strand
[4]. Usually, the mature miRNA is the guide strand for
regulation of gene expression, while the passenger strand
is believed to be degraded and inactivated [5, 6]. The
mature miRNAs regulate gene expression by targeting
mRNAs post-transcriptionally A great deal of evidence has
indicated that microRNAs play a crucial role in regulating
tumor proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis
[7-19]. They also play important roles in development
of glioblastoma [20-22]. Through the down-regulation
of target proteins, microRNAs can function as oncomirs
or tumor suppressors in a cell-specific context. MiR-17-

Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain
tumor, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all central
nervous system malignancies [1]. It is characterized by an
aggressive growth pattern and a resistance to conventional
therapy. Despite extensive efforts, the prognosis is still
very poor, with a median survival of approximately 14
months [1]. Although some advanced cancer patients can
benefit from chemotherapy, residual tumors often recur
soon after treatment. It is believed that a sub-population
of tumor cells is not sensitive to treatment, and might be
the cause of tumor relapse [2, 3]. The characteristics of
these cells, however, remain largely unknown.

RESULTS

92 is one of the most extensively studied clusters. This
cluster and its paralogs have been shown to be associated
with many malignancies such as breast cancer, liver
cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and lymphoma [23-25].
The miR-17-92 cluster has six components which share
common characteristics in structure but differ in functions
[26, 27]. Since each member in this cluster can mediate
multiple pathways and act diversely, there is a pressing
need to explore the precise role of each component. There
are documented evidences that dysfunctions of microRNA
are associated with the development of glioblastoma [28].
Elevated levels of miR-17 were found in glioblastoma
samples and was negatively related to patients’ survival
[29]. MiR-17 is also increased in glioblastoma spheroids,
which are enriched in tumor initiating cells (TICs) or
stem-like cells (TSCs) [30]. Thus, miR-17 has emerged
as a critical regulator in mediating the cellular function of
glioblastoma.
Emerging studies suggest that many stress signals
are responsible for altered microRNA expression and
functions [31-33]. Some microRNAs can modify gene
expression by cross-talking with the tumor microenvironment, and their expression can be altered in turn
by distinct stress conditions such as hypoxia, oxidative
stimulation or radiation [34-42]. In response to stress,
tumor cells often change gene expression to facilitate
their survival [43]. For example, the up-regulation
of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to adapt to
oxygen and nutritional shortage is essential for inducing
tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. HIF-1α is generally
subjected to the negative regulation of tumor suppressors
such as Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN). Notably, HIF-1α is often
found overexpressed in glioblastoma [44]. Our findings
identified that, due to suppression of PTEN by miR17, HIF-1α was stabilized when tumor cells were under
starvation or chemotherapy, and its elevation promoted
survival, motility and angiogenesis. Furthermore, HIF1α overexpression contributed to the generation of
tumor stem-like cells. Interestingly, such effects could
be only achieved in stressed conditions such as serum
deprivation or chemotherapeutic drug treatment, yet
miR-17 reduced tumor growth by targeting murine
double minute 2 (MDM2) under normal circumstances.
Because the retarded proliferation rate often decreases
chemo-sensitivity, miR-17-transfected cells develop
resistance to chemotherapy. Hereby we show miR-17 has
a dual function in glioblastoma: it suppresses tumor cell
growth in normal conditions, and it also promotes tumor
cell survival in unfavorable conditions. This highlights
a potential mechanism in the response of tumor cells to
stress and chemotherapy.

MiR-17 prolongs glioblastoma cell survival and
increases cell motility
To test how glioblastoma cells responded to nutrition
deprivation, we cultured U87 and U343 cells in serumfree medium or medium containing 10% FBS, followed by
analysis of miR-17 levels. We found that cells expressed
higher levels of miR-17-5p when nutrition was deprived
than that cultured in medium containing serum (Fig 1a).
The cells were also treated with the chemotherapeutic
Temozolomide, followed by analysis of miR-17-5p levels.
Treatment with Temozolomide promoted expression of
miR-17-5p (Fig 1a).
To determine the role of miR-17 in glioblastoma
cells, U87 and U343 cells were stably transfected with
miR-17 expressing plasmid. Control cell lines were
also established by using a plasmid without the miR-17
precursor sequence. The levels of miR-17 were detected
by real-time PCR, which confirmed that the expression of
miR-17-5p in the transfected cells was higher than that in
the control cells (Fig 1b).
We then tested the roles of miR-17 in regulating cell
survival. When U87 (Fig 1c) and U343 (Fig 1d) cells were
starved in serum-free medium, there was an increased
amount of survived miR-17-transfected cells compared to
the control.
The abilities of survival and metastasis to large
distance are often complied with tumors that are resistant
to chemotherapeutic drug treatment. In order to evaluate
metastasis potential, cell migration and invasiveness were
measured by wound scratch assay and transwell test. In
cell migration assay, miR-17-transfected cells migrated
faster than the control cells (Fig 1e). Transwell test was
also performed in different serum combination inside
and outside of chambers. The experiments showed that
more cells in the miR-17 group invaded through the
membrane pores, which confirmed that over-expression
of miR-17 could increase cell invasiveness (Fig 1f). In
addition, our findings suggested that miR-17 conferred
survival advantage to glioblastoma cells in an unfavorable
condition and increased cell motility accordingly.

MiR-17 regulates distinct response to starvation
and chemotherapy
Tumor expansions rely on sufficient supply of
oxygen and other essential nutrients. By inducing
angiogenesis, tumor cells avoid being starved and escape
chemotherapy. Emerging data suggest that angiogenesis of
glioblastoma involves the interactions between endothelial
cells and tumor cells [45]. Tube-like structure formation is
an assay widely used to study angiogenesis in vitro. When

co-cultured with endothelial cell line, YPEN, in low serum
medium, the miR-17-transfected cells induced formation
of more tube-like structures than the control cells, but there
was no significant difference when the cells were cultured
in medium containing 10% FBS (Fig 2a). This led us to
explore the expression of HIF-1α and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), which are the major driving forces
of vascularization. Interestingly, HIF-1α was suppressed
in cells cultured in medium containing 10% FBS, but
was highly expressed in the miR-17-transfected cells
cultured in serum-free medium (Fig 2b). These findings
suggest that HIF-1α could only be activated in starved
cells expressing miR-17. HIF-1α is a downstream factor

subjected to the regulation of PTEN, which highlights the
possibility that miR-17 might dominate the PTEN-HIF1α-VEGF pathway. Once PTEN was down-regulated in
cells overexpressing miR-17, HIF-1α was activated in
response to serum deprivation stress. HIF-1α was also
reported to be negatively regulated by VHL, but we did
not detect any change of VHL expression levels in either
10% FBS or serum-free conditions (Supplementary Fig
S1). Given that VHL is specifically sensitive to oxygen
concentration changes, PTEN-HIF-1α-VEGF pathway was
shown to mainly mediate glioblastoma cells’ response to
starved conditions [46]. HIF-1α activation also facilitated
up-regulation of VEGF, which was elevated in miR-17-

transfected cells during serum deprivation (Fig 2b).
We further found that miR-17 regulated cell
response under chemotherapy. When glioblastoma cells
were treated with Docetaxel, miR-17 over-expressed
cells survived better than the control cells (Fig 2c).
Herein, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
was calculated and applied to long-term chemotherapy.
Notably, HIF-1α was induced within 1 day in the miR17-transfected cells, which was similar to what we found
during serum deprivation. However, activation of HIF-1α
could not be maintained after 4 days, which might be due
to reduced cell viability after prolonged treatment (Fig 2d).

Since HIF-1α is involved in response to drug treatment in
glioblastoma [44], our data suggested that miR-17 could
confer drug resistance to the cells by regulating the PTEN/
HIF-1α pathway.

MiR-17 induces HIF-1α activation in response to
stress by targeting PTEN
PTEN is a tumor suppressor which dominates the
PTEN/HIF-1α pathway. Inactivation of PTEN often
allows for the over-expression of HIF-1α, leading to
cascade reactions in angiogenesis and migration. It has

been reported that PTEN is a target of the miR-17-92
cluster, and indeed we detected two potential binding
sites for miR-17 in PTEN 3’UTR (Fig 3a). Western blot
was employed to analyze PTEN levels in the miR-17transfected cells. Compared with the control cells, PTEN
was down-regulated in cells over-expressing miR-17 (Fig
3b). The luciferase assay was then employed to determine
whether miR-17 could target PTEN directly. Fragments
in PTEN 3’UTR containing the binding sites of miR17 were cloned into the pMir-report vector. Constructs
with mutated binding sites were also generated to serve
as controls (Fig 3c). U87 cells were co-transfected with
miR-17 plasmid and one of the luciferase constructs.

The experiments showed that luciferase activities
were repressed when the luciferase constructs were cotransfected with miR-17 plasmid, and the inhibitory effect
of miR-17 was abolished when the binding sites were
mutated (Fig 3d). We then transfected U87 cells with
siRNA targeting PTEN, which confirmed silencing of
PTEN expression (Fig 3e, left). Down-regulation of PTEN
led to increased expression of HIF-1α (Fig 3e, right), and
thus prolonged the survival of the cells (Fig 3e, lower).
To confirm that PTEN played an important role in
mediating miR-17 function, we transfected the miR-17expressing cells with PTEN expression construct or a
vector control. After confirming expression of the ectopic

of neurospheres formed in cells overexpressing miR17 were much larger than those formed in control cells
(Fig 4a, left panel). To confirm that these spheres were
alive, we continued to maintain the spheres in serum-free
medium or serum-containing medium. When serum was
included in the cultures, the spheres adhered to the culture
plates, and this is an indication of cell survival (Fig 4a,
right panel). Another prominent character of GSCs is
that they can undergo self-renewal and differentiate. We
thus tested the self-renewal ability of glioblastoma cells
in SFM and found that the number of secondary spheres
formed in cells over-expressing miR-17 was significantly
higher than those formed in the control cells (Fig 4b). We
then examined the tumorigenesis of glioblastoma spheroid
using the colony formation assay. After the cells have been
grown on agarose-containing plates for three weeks, more
colonies could be seen in miR-17-transfected cells (Fig

It is generally thought that TSCs play a major role
in tumor re-vascularization and re-aggregation, eventually
leading to tumor relapse. Although the definition of TSCs is
still controversial, CD133, a cell surface glycoprotein, has
been used extensively as a marker of glioblastoma stemlike cells (GSC). GSCs significantly increase their number
in neurospheres when cultivated in SFM containing EGF
and FGF. In order to get the neurospheres, U87 and U343
cells were cultured in SFM for two weeks, and the sizes

that in the control cells (Fig 5a). Moreover, when plated
in serum, these floating neurospheres could differentiate
to adherent cells again. The miR-17-transfected adhesive
cells still expressed higher levels of CD133 than the
control cells (Fig S2).
Since we have shown that HIF-1α was up-regulated
by miR-17 expression, we explored its involvement in the
generation of GSCs. U87 cells were stably transfected
with HIF-1α construct and plated into serum-free medium.
Similar to what we observed in miR-17-transfected cells,
HIF-1α over-expression increased the number of survival
cells compared with the control (Fig 5b). Moreover,
CD133+ ratio also increased in HIF-1α transfected cells
(Fig 5c).

GSCs are thought to play an important role in
drug resistance. Therefore, we investigated the effects
of chemotherapeutic agents on glioblastoma cells. As
expected, overexpression of miR-17 facilitated cell
survival after treating the U343 cells with Docetaxel (Fig
4d). We also treated the miR-17- and vector-transfected
U87 cells with Docetaxel, Carmustine and Temozolomide,
followed by analysis of sensitivities of the cells to these
drugs. We confirmed that the cells transfected with miR-17
displayed resistance to all of these drugs (Fig 4e).
Additionally, we examined the expression of CD133
using flow cytometry. The percentage of CD133 positive
in the miR-17-transfected cells was much higher than

DISCUSSION

MiR-17 reduces glioblastoma cell proliferation

Given the fact that tumors often develop as a result
of an aberrant response to a stress signal, it is important to
determine the molecular biological mechanism involved.
The theory of “tumor-starving therapy” suggests that
tumor vascularization is critical to its survival. Therefore,
bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, has
been approved to treat glioblastoma. It is believed to be
able to starve tumors by blocking their blood supply.
Nevertheless, highly penetrant tumor growth patterns
in bevacizumab-treated patients have been repeatedly
documented [49]. It is believed that a subpopulation of
cells is resistant to “starving” treatment. Here we identify
that miR-17-transfected glioblastoma cells survived longer
under starved stress, with the potential to develop the tubelike structures of endothelial cells and to enrich GSCs.
These may facilitate angiogenesis and increase the number
of TSCs.
Our results revealed the unique response of HIF1α to stimuli, suggesting a role of HIF-1α in mediating
miR-17 functions. As a key transcription factor evoked
upon exposure to hypoxia, HIF-1α can be observed best
at a distance from blood vessels in tissue, but is absent
immediately when oxygenated. In general, HIF-1α is
ubiquitinated and degraded by VHL under normoxia but
activated under hypoxia. In addition to that, it can be
regulated by other suppressors such as PTEN and MDM2
[50]. PTEN’s loss of function results in HIF-1α activation
by dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, especially in
glioblastoma cells [51]. The PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway
has been experimentally shown to be associated with
stress adaptation, such as serum deprivation [52]. We
showed that PTEN was one of the targets of miR-17 in
glioblastoma cells. miR-17 could respond to stress signals
by targeting PTEN, suggesting our findings might be
of clinical implication. Firstly, because glioblastoma is
characterized by its uncontrolled vascularization and high
expression of miR-17 in tumor samples, miR-17 may
take part in the process of glioblastoma angiogenesis by
activating HIF-1α and VEGF indirectly. Secondly, since
miR-17 endows cells with the ability to escape “tumorstarving therapy” by increasing survival and motility,
cautions should be taken when treating patients with
anti-angiogenesis therapy, especially for those who have
tumors that are over-expressing miR-17.
We also demonstrated that miR-17 has dual roles
in cell growth: it reduces the tumor proliferation rate,
but protects cells from cytotoxic agents’ treatment. This
is consistent with our previous data that elucidated that
slower growing cells are more resistant to chemotherapyinduced cell death [53]. Currently, chemotherapeutic
agents that are commonly used in treating glioblastoma act
by interfering with DNA replication, such as temozolimide
and carmustine. It is conceivable that fast growing tumor
cells are more easily suffered from cytotoxic agents

In order to examine the effect of miR-17 on
glioblastoma cell growth, a cell proliferation assay was
performed and miR-17-overexpressing cells were found to
have a significantly reduced growth rate (Fig 6a). This was
in line with cell cycle analysis, in which the percentage
of cells in G1 phase was much higher in miR-17overexpressed cells as compared with the control (Fig 6b).
Our findings indicated that miR-17 inhibited glioblastoma
cell proliferation, which is in agreement with other studies
revealing similar results on breast cancer cells [47]. Taken
together, these results suggest that miR-17 suppresses
glioblastoma cell growth under normal circumstances.

MiR-17-3p targets MDM2 in glioblastoma cells
We then sought to identify the targets that mediated
miR-17 suppressing glioblastoma cell growth. Taking
advantage of the online databases and computational
algorithms, we screened a series of genes that could
promote cell proliferation. In silico analysis, MDM2
revealed three potential binding sites for miR-17-3p in its
3’UTR (Fig 7a). MDM2 is an oncogene which is highly
expressed in glioblastoma and it widely participates in
tumorigenesis and progression. It is thought to inhibit
the activation of p53, but it can also regulate tumor cell
proliferation independently [48]. We found a decreased
level of MDM2 in miR-17-overexpressed cells (Fig 7b),
but there was no change in p53 expression (Fig S3), which
suggests that miR-17 may function in a p53-independent
pathway. To confirm whether miR-17-3p targeted MDM2
directly, we generated three reporter constructs, each
containing a fragment of wild-type or mutated MDM2
3’UTR sequence downstream of a luciferase coding
sequence (Fig 7c). U87 cells were co-transfected with
miR-17 plasmid and one of the constructs. There was a
decrease in luciferase activities in the cells transfected
with the MDM2 3’UTR construct, but the inhibitory effect
was abolished when the miR-17-3p binding sites were
mutated (Fig 7d).
We then validated whether MDM2 played an
essential role in modulating U87 cell activities. The cells
were transfected with siRNA complementary to MDM2.
Silencing of MDM2 was confirmed using Western
blotting (Fig 8a), and knockdown of MDM2 reduced
cell proliferation (Fig 8b). To corroborate this result, we
performed rescue experiments by transfecting U87 cells
with MDM2 expression construct. After confirming upregulation of MDM2 (Fig 8c), the effect of MDM2 on
cell proliferation was tested, and we found that overexpression of MDM2 in the miR-17-transfected cells
resulted in enhanced cell growth (Fig 8d).

compared with slower growing cells. MiR-17 therefore
can induce chemo-resistance on glioblastoma cells by
slowing down their proliferation. In addition, a reduced
cell proliferation rate also benefits cells under starved
conditions because a slower metabolic rate requires limited
nutritional supply. Thus, by targeting both MDM2 and
PTEN simultaneously, miR-17 could act through several
modes to regulate stress response. Very recently, similar
finding were reported on other microRNAs (miR-141
and miR-200a) which potentially modulate the oxidative
stress response in ovarian carcinogenesis [54]. It was
concluded that miR-141 and miR-200a promoted tumor
growth but sensitized tumors to chemotherapy, which was
in agreement with our perspectives. These data support
the emerging model of microRNA: a buffering function.
This refers to a microRNA’s ability to target several
pathways as both a positive and a negative regulator [55].
Documented examples have shown that the buffering
function of microRNA is critical to maintain homeostasis
in the systemic network [33, 42]. It has been proposed that
MDM2 can also ubiquitinate and degrade HIF-1α through
the proteasome pathway, which raises the possibility that
miR-17 mediates cellular response to diverse stimuli by
targeting closely related signaling pathways [56].
The ability of miR-17 to induce generation of
glioblastoma stem-like cells is another interesting finding
of our work. Although the role of microRNAs in the
development of TSC has been studied extensively, there
is still no general agreement on the definitions of TSCs in
vitro [57, 58]. It is known that TSCs can both undergo selfrenewal and differentiate into a spectrum of mature cells.
Moreover, recent discoveries indicate that they are widely
involved in tumor progression, therapy resistance and
distant metastasis. In glioblastoma, serum-free medium
is a well-established method to enrich GSCs which
can be detected by CD133 expression [59, 60]. Serum
contains essential nutrition factors for tumor cell growth.
During tumor progression to an advanced stage, it could
be deprived of serum, under the stress of growth factor
deficiency. In this study we reported that miR-17 not only
increased CD133 positive cells when cultured in SFM,
but also increased capacities of self-renewal and colony
formation ability. This may be due to the activation of
HIF-1α, which was documented to promote neurosphere
formation in SFM [61]. To support this, we over-expressed
HIF-1α in glioblastoma cells and measured the changes
of GSCs. Not surprisingly, there was increased number
of GSCs in HIF-1α-transfected cells compared with that
of the control cells. Our findings confirm the critical role
of HIF-1α in GSCs development and maintenance. More
importantly, GSCs are often thought to be responsible
for drug resistance, which may be another potential
mechanism accounting for chemo-resistance in tumor cells
over-expressing miR-17. At last, we found that miR-17
increased tumor cell migration and invasiveness, which
can also be found in neural stem cells [60]. Taken together,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miR-17 induced the generation of GSCs which display
stem-like behaviors in multiple ways.
In summary, our findings reveal a novel mechanism
of stress response in glioblastoma cells. During serum
deprivation, miR-17 prolonged tumor cell survival,
induced angiogenesis and promoted stem-like cell
aggregation by repressing expression of MDM2 and
PTEN and modulating HIF-1α levels. We thus proposed
a signal pathway delineating miR-17 activities (Fig
8d). This adds new insights to our knowledge about
microRNAs as mediators in tumor development. It has
practical implications on clinical diagnosis and treatment.
In glioblastoma patients, miR-17 could be used as a
predictive marker of response to chemotherapy and
anti-angiogenesis treatment. Although further studies
are needed on the prognostic value of miR-17, our data
suggests surgery and not drug treatment as a better option
for patients who show over-expression of miR-17.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures
Human glioblastoma cell lines U87 (HTB-14) and
U343 were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL) and
streptomycin (100 U/mL). Serum-free medium (SFM) was
prepared by using DMEM-F12 medium supplemented
with glucose (4.5 g/L), epidermal growth factor (EGF)
(20 ng/mL) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (10 ng/
mL) [62]. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator
containing 5% CO2 at 37℃ and passed every 3-4 days as
described [63].

Construct generation
A cDNA sequence, containing two human premiR-17 units, a CMV promoter driving expression
of GFP and an H1 promoter, was inserted into a
mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 between the
restriction enzyme sites BglII and HindIII [27, 64]. Green
fluorescence was used to monitor transfected cells.
The primers’ sequences which were used in
luciferase activity assay are listed in Supplementary
Information Fig S5. The 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR)
of MDM2 contains four potential binding sites for miR-17
while the 3’UTR of PTEN contains two. For each binding
site, two pairs of primers were used to clone the fragments
of 3’UTR and mutant controls. The PCR products were
digested with SacI and MluI, followed by insertion into a
SacI- and MluI-digested pMir-Report vector (Ambion) to
obtain a luciferase construct or a mutant counterpart [65].
The PTEN cDNA with coding region was purchased
from Origene and the HIF-1α is a generous gift from

Tube formation assay

Dr. Peng at York University. The MDM2 cDNA was
amplified by using two primers: MDM2-Kozak-BamHI
(5’cccggatccgccaccatgtgcaataccaacatgtctgtacc)
and
MDM2-CMyc-Xbal(5’ctatctagacaggtcctcctcggagatcagc
ttctgctccatggggaaataagttagcacaatcatttg). Then the PCR
product was cloned into pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen),
and the identity of the insert was confirmed by DNA
sequencing.

YPEN cells were mixed with miR-17-transfected
cells or control cells and cultivated with BD MatrigelTM
in 48-well plates. As described previously, the tube-like
structures were observed and recorded by microscopic
examination after 24 hours [67, 68].

Western blot analysis

RNA analysis
Total cell RNA was extracted using mirVanaTM
miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). RT-PCR was performed as
described previously [66]. The primers specific for mature
miR-17 were purchased from Qiagen. Human U6 RNA
was used as control.

[69].

Flow cytometry
For cell cycle analysis, cells in the logarithmic phase
were harvested and washed twice in PBS. Following
adjustment of cell concentration to 2 x 106 cells/mL in 50
µL PBS/HBSS with 2% calf serum, 1 mL 80% ice cold
ethanol was added and incubated for 30 minutes. The cells
were re-suspended in 500 µL HBSS containing 0.1 mg/
mL of Propidium Iodide (Sigma) and 0.6% of NP-40. The
DNA content was measured by flow cytometry (Beckman
Coulter).
For antibody staining, 1 x 106 cells were washed
twice in PBS before re-suspension in 50 µL HBSS with
2% calf serum. Anti-CD133 antibody (Abcam, 1:20
dilution) was added and stained on ice for 30 minutes.
The cells were pellet, and 1 µL of cy5-conjugated goatanti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added into
each tube. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted after
30 minutes and CD133 ratio was detected by FL4. The
data was analyzed using FlowJo 9.1 software.

Cell function test
In proliferation assay, transfected U87 and U343
cells were plated onto 100 mm tissue culture plates at a
density of 1 x 105 cells/well in DMEM containing 2.5%,
5% or 10% FBS and maintained for 5 days. Similarly, a
survival assay was performed by starving the cells (1 x
106 cells/well) in serum-free medium for up to 2 weeks.
The cells were harvested and cell numbers were counted
in different time points.
To test drug sensitivity, Docetaxel (Sanofi-aventis),
Temozolomide (Merck) and Carmustine (Bristol-Myers
Squibb) were applied to adhered cultures. All of the
drugs were purchased from the Pharmacy Department at
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. The cell number was
counted every other day after Trypan Blue staining.

Cell migration assay

Colony formation and self-renewal assay

Migration studies were performed by wound
scratch tests and transwell invasion tests respectively. In
the scratch test, different serum concentration (0%, 2.5%,
5%, 10%) were applied in culture medium. The monolayer
of cells was scraped linearly with pipette tips, washed
to remove cell debris and replenished with fresh media.
Microscope images of the scratch test were captured at the
beginning and at different intervals later. In the transwell
invasion assay, 24-transwell (Coster) was coated with
100 µl BD MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences) at a density of
1 mg/mL. 1 x 106 of cells were suspended in DMEM
containing 1% FBS and 100μL were transferred into the
upper chamber of the transwell. The lower chamber was
filled with 600 µL DMEM containing 10% FBS. After
incubation for 24 hours, MatrigelTM was removed with
a cotton swab and invaded cells were stained with DiffQuick solution (Fisher Scientific).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blot was performed as previously described

Colony formation was assessed by mixing 1000 cells
with 0.33% low-melting agarose in DMEM supplemented
with 5% FBS and plated on 0.66% agarose-coated 6-well
tissue culture plates. After four weeks, colonies were
stained by Coomassie blue (Bio-Rad) and photographed.
For cell self-renewal assay, cells were cultured in serumfree medium for two weeks before spheroid formed.
Individual spheroids were plated at clonal density in nonadherent culture. Secondary spheroids were counted 5
days later.

MTT assay
Ten thousand cells in 200 µL media per well were
seeded and cultured in a 96-well plate for 24 hours. Two
micro liters of drug in sequential diluted concentrations
were added to each well and incubated overnight.
1665

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 1653-1668

Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was diluted
to 5 mg/mL in PBS and 20 µL were added to each well.
After 3 hours, the cells were re-suspended in 200 µL of
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and shaken for 15 minutes.
The absorbance value was recorded at 570 nm using a
microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).

seeded onto 12-well tissue culture dishes at a density of
1 x 105 cells/well and co-transfected with the luciferase
reporter constructs and miR-17 plasmid or positive control
sequences with Lipofectamine 2000. After 12 hours, cell
lysate was prepared by employing Dual-Luciferase®
