Abstract
Recent clinical trials showed that targeting of inhibitory receptors on T cells induces durable
responses in a subset of cancer patients, despite advanced disease. However, the regulatory
switches controlling T cell function in immunosuppressive tumors are not well understood. Here
we show that such inhibitory mechanisms can be systematically discovered in the tumor
microenvironment. We devised an in vivo pooled shRNA screen in which shRNAs targeting
negative regulators became highly enriched in tumors by releasing a block on T cell proliferation
upon tumor antigen recognition. Such shRNAs were identified by deep sequencing of the shRNA
cassette from T cells infiltrating tumor or control tissues. One of the target genes was Ppp2r2d, a
regulatory subunit of the PP2A phosphatase family: In tumors, Ppp2r2d knockdown inhibited T

cell apoptosis and enhanced T cell proliferation as well as cytokine production. Key regulators of
immune function can thus be discovered in relevant tissue microenvironments.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Recent work has shown that cytotoxic T cells play a central role in immune-mediated
control of cancer1–7. T cells are able to specifically detect and eliminate cancer cells
following T cell receptor (TCR) mediated recognition of tumor-derived peptides bound to
MHC proteins8. A series of studies have convincingly demonstrated that the extent of tumor
infiltration by cytotoxic T cells is a critical factor determining the natural progression of
diverse types of cancers1–4,9–11. A landmark study showed that the type, density, and
location of cytotoxic T cells within tumors enabled better prediction of patient survival than
histopathological methods used for staging of cancers. Strong infiltration of both the tumor
center and the invasive tumor margin by cytotoxic T cells (which express the CD8 surface
marker) was shown to correlate with a favorable prognosis, regardless of the local extent of
tumor invasion and spread to local lymph nodes. Conversely, weak in situ expansion of CD8
T cells correlated with a poor prognosis even in patients with minimal tumor invasion1.
However, in the majority of patients this natural defense mechanism is severely blunted by
immunosuppressive cell populations recruited to the tumor microenvironment, including
regulatory T cells, immature myeloid cell populations and tumor-associated
macrophages4,12–14. Highly complex interactions among a variety of different cell types –
including tumor cells, immune cells and stromal cells – in the tumor microenvironment thus
contribute to clinical outcome.

Author Manuscript

The critical role of T cells in immune-mediated control of cancers is further underscored by
therapeutic benefit following administration of monoclonal antibodies targeting inhibitory
receptors on T cells, CTLA-4 and PD-1 15–18. Clinical benefit is enhanced by coadministration of antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-119,20. Particularly exciting is the
finding that such antibodies can induce durable responses in a subset of patients with
advanced disease. However, many of the regulatory pathways in T cells that result in loss of
function within immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments remain unknown.

Immune cells perform complex surveillance functions throughout the body and interact with
many different types of cells in distinct tissue microenvironments. Therapeutic targets for
modulating immune responses are typically identified in vitro and tested in animal models at
a late stage of the process. We postulated that the complex interactions of immune cells
within tissues - many of which do not occur in vitro - offer untapped opportunities for
therapeutic intervention. Here we have addressed the challenge of how targets for immune
modulation can be systematically discovered in vivo.

Design of in vivo discovery approach
Pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) libraries have been shown to be powerful discovery
tools21–23. We reasoned that shRNAs capable of restoring CD8 T cell function can be
systematically discovered in vivo by taking advantage of the extensive proliferative capacity
of T cells following triggering of the TCR by a tumor-associated antigen. When introduced

into T cells, only a small subset of shRNAs from a pool will restore T cell proliferation,
resulting in their enrichment within tumors. Over-representation of active shRNAs within a
pool can be quantified by deep sequencing of the shRNA cassette from tumors and
secondary lymphoid organs (Fig. 1a).

Author Manuscript

We chose B16 melanoma, an aggressive tumor that is difficult to treat24. Melanoma cells
expressed the surrogate tumor antigen ovalbumin (Ova), which is recognized by CD8 T cells
from OT-I T cell receptor transgenic mice25,26. Initial experiments showed that such a
screen could also be performed with pmel-1 T cells that recognize gp100, an endogenous
melanoma antigen27, but the signal/noise ratio was lower for pmel-1 T cells due to smaller T
cell populations in tumors. Naïve T cells are difficult to infect with lentiviral vectors, and we
therefore pretreated T cells for two days with the homeostatic cytokines IL-7 and IL-15 prior
to spin infection with shRNA pools in a lentiviral vector. Successful transduction was
monitored by surface expression of the Thy1.1 reporter (Extended Data Fig. 1a). T cells
were injected into B6 mice bearing day 14 B16-Ova tumors. Seven days later, T cells were
purified from tumors and secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, tumor-draining and irrelevant
lymph nodes) for isolation of genomic DNA, followed by PCR amplification of the shRNA
cassette (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The representation of shRNAs was then quantified in
different tissues by Illumina sequencing.

In vivo shRNA pool screens

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Two large screens were performed, with the first focusing on genes over-expressed in
dysfunctional T cells (T cell anergy or exhaustion; 255 genes, 1,275 shRNAs divided into
two pools), and the second on kinases/phosphatases (1,307 genes, 6,535 shRNAs divided
into seven pools) (Table 1a). In these primary screens, each gene was represented by ~5
shRNAs (it is common that only one or two of such shRNAs have sufficient activity in
pooled screens). We observed multiple distinct in vivo phenotypes. For certain genes,
shRNAs were over-represented in all tested tissues compared to the starting T cell
population (e.g. SHP-1), indicative of enhanced proliferation independent of TCR
recognition of a tumor antigen. For other genes, there was a selective loss of shRNAs within
tumors (e.g. ZAP-70, a critical kinase in the T cell activation pathway). We focused our
analysis on genes whose shRNAs showed substantial over-representation in tumor but not
spleen, a secondary lymphoid organ. Substantial T cell accumulation in tumors was
observed for a number of shRNAs, despite the immunosuppressive environment. For
secondary screens, we created focused pools in which each candidate gene was represented
by ~15 shRNAs. Primary data from this analysis are shown for three genes in Fig. 1b: LacZ
(negative control), Cblb (an E3 ubiquitin ligase that induces T cell receptor
internalization)28 and Ppp2r2d (not previously studied in T cells). For both Ppp2r2d and
Cblb, five shRNAs were substantially increased in tumors (red) compared to spleen, while
no enrichment was observed for LacZ shRNAs. Overall, 43 genes met the following criteria:
≥4-fold enrichment for 3 or more shRNAs in tumors compared to spleen (Table 1a,
Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). The set included gene products previously identified as inhibitors
of T cell receptor signaling (including Cblb, Dgka, Dgkz, Ptpn2) as well as other wellknown inhibitors of T cell function (e.g. Smad2, Socs1, Socs3, Egr2), validating our
approach (Table 1b, Extended Data Table 1).29–31

We next confirmed at a cellular level that these shRNAs induce T cell accumulation in
tumors. OT-I T cells were infected with lentiviral vectors driving expression of a single
shRNA and a reporter protein (Thy1.1 or one of four different fluorescent proteins), and
after seven days the frequency of shRNA-transduced T cells was quantified in tumors,
spleens and lymph nodes by flow cytometry. When the control LacZ shRNA was expressed
in CD8 T cells, the frequency of shRNA-expressing CD8 T cells was lower in tumors
compared to spleen (~2-fold). In contrast, experimental shRNAs induced accumulation of
CD8 T cells in tumors but not the spleen (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a). T cell
accumulation in tumors was >10-fold relative to spleen for seven of these genes. The
strongest phenotype was observed with shRNAs targeting Ppp2r2d, a regulatory subunit of
the family of PP2A phosphatases32. A Ppp2r2d shRNA not only induced accumulation of
OT-I CD8 T cells, but also CD4 T cells (from TRP-1 TCR transgenic mice)33, with T cell
numbers in tumors being significantly higher when Ppp2r2d rather than LacZ shRNA was
expressed (36.3-fold for CD8; 16.2-fold for CD4 T cells) (Fig. 2b). CD8 T cell accumulation
correlated with the degree of Ppp2r2d knock-down, and two Ppp2r2d shRNAs with the
highest in vivo activity induced the lowest levels of Ppp2r2d mRNA (Extended Data Fig.
2b). Ppp2r2d knockdown was also confirmed at the protein level using a quantitative mass
spectrometry approach (Fig. 2e). Ppp2r2d shRNA activity was specific because the
phenotype was reversed when a Ppp2r2d cDNA (with wild-type protein sequence, but
mutated DNA sequence at the shRNA binding site) was co-introduced with the Ppp2r2d
shRNA (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 3). Furthermore, OT-I CD8 T cells over-expressed
Ppp2r2d in tumors compared to spleen (in the absence of any shRNA expression),
suggesting that it is an intrinsic component of the signaling network inhibiting T cell
function in tumors (Fig. 2d). Microarray analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells expressing
different shRNAs showed that each shRNA induced a largely distinct set of gene expression
changes, indicating that improved T cell function in tumors can be mediated through a
number of different intracellular pathways (Extended Data Fig. 4).

Cellular mechanisms for Ppp2r2d

Author Manuscript

We next examined the cellular mechanisms driving T cell accumulation by a Ppp2r2d
shRNA in tumors - specifically T cell infiltration, proliferation and apoptosis. T cell
infiltration into tumors was assessed by transfer of OT-I CD8 T cells labeled with a
cytosolic dye (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester, CFSE). No differences were observed
in the frequency of Ppp2r2d or LacZ shRNA-transduced CD8 T cells in tumors on day 1,
arguing against a substantial effect on T cell infiltration (Fig. 3a). However, analysis of later
time points (days 3–7) demonstrated a higher degree of proliferation (based on CFSE
dilution) by Ppp2r2d compared to LacZ shRNA-transduced T cells (Fig. 3b, Extended Data
Fig. 5a). The action of Ppp2r2d was downstream of T cell receptor activation because T cell
proliferation was enhanced in tumors and to a lesser extent in tumor-draining lymph nodes
(Extended Data Fig. 5a). In contrast, no proliferation was observed in irrelevant lymph
nodes or the spleen where the relevant antigen was not presented to T cells (data not shown).
Substantial T cell proliferation was even observed for LacZ shRNA-transduced T cells
(complete dilution of CFSE dye by day 7), despite the presence of small numbers of such

cells in tumors. This suggested that LacZ shRNA-transduced T cells were lost by apoptosis.
Indeed, a larger percentage of tumor-infiltrating T cells were labeled with an antibody
specific for active caspase-3 when the LacZ control shRNA (rather than Ppp2r2d shRNA)
was expressed (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 5b). Furthermore, co-culture of CD8 T cells with
B16-Ova tumor cells showed that the majority of LacZ shRNA expressing T cells became
apoptotic (65.7%) while most Ppp2r2d shRNA-transduced T cells were viable (89.5%, Fig.
3d).

Author Manuscript

These results suggested the possibility that Ppp2r2d shRNA-transduced CD8 T cells may be
able to proliferate and survive even when they recognize their antigen directly presented by
B16-Ova tumor cells. This idea was tested by implantation of tumor cells into b2m−/− mice
which are deficient in expression of MHC class I proteins34. In such mice, only tumor cells
but not professional antigen presenting cells of the host could present tumor antigens to T
cells. Indeed, Ppp2r2d shRNA-transduced OT-I CD8 T cells showed massive accumulation
within B16-Ova tumors in b2m−/− mice (Fig. 3e) while very small numbers of T cells were
present in contralateral B16 tumors that lacked expression of the Ova antigen. Ppp2r2dsilenced T cells could thus effectively proliferate and survive in response to tumor cells,
despite a lack of suitable co-stimulatory signals and an inhibitory microenvironment.

Author Manuscript

Ex vivo analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells at a single-cell level using a nanowell
device35,36 also demonstrated that Ppp2r2d silencing increased cytokine production by T
cells (Fig. 4a–c). T cells were activated for 3 hours by CD3/CD28 antibodies on lipid
bilayers, followed by 1 hour cytokine capture on antibody-coated slides. CD8 T cells
showed a higher secretion rate for IFNγ, IL-2 and GM-CSF, and a larger fraction of T cells
more than one cytokine (Fig. 4b,c). The presence of larger numbers of IFNγ-producing T
cells was confirmed by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 5c).
PP2A represents a family of phosphatase complexes composed of catalytic, scaffolding and
regulatory subunits. Cellular localization and substrate specificity are determined by one of
many regulatory subunits of which Ppp2r2d is a member32. Ppp2r2d directs PP2A to Cdk1
substrates during interphase and anaphase; it thereby inhibits entry into mitosis and induces
exit from mitosis37. PP2A also plays a gatekeeper role for BAD-mediated apoptosis.
Phosphorylated BAD is sequestered in its inactive form in the cytosol by 14-3-3, while
dephosphorylated BAD is targeted to mitochondria where it causes cell death by binding
Bcl-XL and Bcl-238. PP2A phosphatases have also been shown to interact with the
cytoplasmic domains of CD28 and CTLA-4 as well as Carma1 (upstream of the NF-κB
pathway)39,40, but it is not known which regulatory subunits are required for these activities;
Ppp2r2d antibodies suitable for the required biochemical studies are currently not available.

Enhanced anti-tumor immunity
Finally, we assessed the ability of a Ppp2r2d shRNA to enhance the efficacy of adoptive T
cell therapy. B16-Ova tumor cells (2×105) were injected subcutaneously into B6 mice. On
day 12, mice bearing tumors of similar size were divided into seven groups, either receiving
no T cells, 2×106 shRNA-transduced TRP-1 CD4 T cells, 2H-2K106 shRNA infected OT-I
CD8 T cells, or both CD4 and CD8 T cells (days 12 and day 17). The modest anti-tumor

activity of OT-I CD8 T cells (expressing the control LacZ shRNA) is consistent with
published data41. Ppp2r2d-silencing improved the therapeutic activity of both CD4 and CD8
T cells (Fig. 5a,b). A Ppp2r2d shRNA also enhanced anti-tumor responses when introduced
into T cells specific for the endogenous melanoma antigens gp100 (pmel-1 CD8 T cells) and
TRP-1 (TRP-1 CD4 T cells) (Fig. 5c). Gp100 is a relevant antigen in human melanoma, and
a clinical trial in which a gp100-specific TCR (isolated from HLA-A2 transgenic mice) was
introduced into peripheral blood T cells demonstrated therapeutic benefit in a subset of
patients42.

Author Manuscript

Ppp2r2d-silenced T cells acquired an effector phenotype in tumors (Extended Data Fig. 6a)
and >30% of the cells expressed granzyme B (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Consistent with
greatly increased numbers of such effector T cells in tumors (Extended Data Fig. 7b),
TUNEL staining demonstrated increased apoptosis in tumors when Ppp2r2d rather than
LacZ shRNA expressing T cells were present (Extended Data Fig. 7c). B16 melanomas are
highly aggressive tumors in part because MHC class I expression is very low. Interestingly,
Ppp2r2d but not LacZ shRNA-expressing T cells significantly increased MHC class I
expression (H-2Kb) by tumor cells (Extended Data Fig. 7d), possibly due to the observed
increase in IFNγ secretion by T cells (Fig. 4b–d). A Ppp2r2d shRNA did not reduce
expression of inhibitory PD-1 or LAG-3 receptors on tumor-infiltrating T cells,
demonstrating that its mechanism of action is distinct from these known negative regulators
of T cell function (Extended Data Fig. 6b). This finding suggests combination approaches
targeting these intracellular and cell surface molecules.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

These results establish the feasibility of in vivo discovery of novel targets for
immunotherapy in complex tissue microenvironments. We show that it is possible to
discover genes with differential action across tissues, as exemplified by T cell accumulation
in tumors compared to secondary lymphoid organs. For genes with tissue-selective action, T
cell proliferation and survival are likely to be under the control of the T cell receptor and
therefore do not occur in tissues lacking presentation of a relevant antigen. Many variations
of the approach presented here can be envisioned to investigate control of particular immune
cell functions in vivo. For example, fluorescent reporters for expression of cytokines or
cytotoxic molecules (granzyme B, perforin) could be integrated into our approach to
discover genes that control critical T cell effector functions in tumors.

Author Manuscript

Targeting of key regulatory switches may offer new approaches to modify the activity of T
cells in cancer and other pathologies. For example, recent clinical trials have shown that
transfer of genetically modified T cells can result in substantial anti-tumor activity43–46. The
efficacy of such T cell-based therapies could be enhanced by shRNA-mediated silencing of
genes that inhibit T cell function in the tumor microenvironment.

Methods Summary
In vivo shRNA screening

Author Manuscript

Nine shRNA pools (~5 shRNAs per gene) were created and subcloned into the pLKOThy1.1 lentiviral vector. Each pool also included 85 negative-control shRNAs. OT-I T cells
were cultured with IL-7 (5ng/mL) and IL-15 (100ng/mL); on day 2 cells were spin-infected
with lentiviral pools supplemented with protamine sulfate (5µg/mL) in retronectin-coated
24-well plates (5µg/mL) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 15. Following infection,
OT-1 cells were cultured with IL-7 (2.5ng/mL), IL-15 (50ng/mL) and IL-2 (2ng/mL). On
day 5, shRNA-transduced T cells were enriched by positive selection using the Thy1.1
surface reporter (Stemcell Technologies). T cells (5×106) were injected i.v. into C57BL/6
mice bearing day 14 B16-Ova tumors (15 mice per shRNA pool). Seven days later, shRNAexpressing T cells (CD8+Vα2+Vβ5+Thy1.1+) were isolated by flow cytometry from tumors,
spleens, tumor-draining lymph nodes and irrelevant lymph nodes. Genomic DNA was
purified (Qiagen) and deep-sequencing templates were generated by PCR amplification of
the shRNA cassette. Representation of shRNAs in each pool was analyzed by deep
sequencing using an Illumina Genome Analyzer47.

Author Manuscript

Secondary screens were performed using focused pools containing ~15 shRNAs/gene as
well as 85 negative controls. Cut-off in the secondary screen was defined as >3 shRNAs
with >4 fold enrichment in tumor relative to spleen. Screening results were validated at a
cellular level by introducing individual shRNAs into T cells, along with a reporter protein
(GFP, TFP, RFP or Ametrine fluorescent proteins, Thy1.1). This approach enabled
simultaneous testing of five shRNAs in an animal (three mice per group). Proliferation of
shRNA-transduced T cells was visualized based on CFSE dilution after 24 hours as well as
3, 5 and 7 days.

Methods
In vivo shRNA screening

Author Manuscript

The study design was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee
(IACUC). shRNAs targeting 255 genes over-expressed in dysfunctional T cells (anergic or
exhausted state) and 1,307 kinase/phosphatase genes (~5 shRNAs per gene) were obtained
from The RNAi Consortium (TRC; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA,
USA). Nine pools were created and shRNAs subcloned into the pLKO-Thy1.1 lentiviral
vector. Each pool also contained 85 negative-control shRNAs (number of shRNAs: GFP,
24; LacZ, 20; luciferase 25; RFP 16). OT-I T cells isolated by negative selection (Stemcell
Technologies) were cultured with IL-7 (5ng/mL, Peprotech) and IL-15 (100ng/mL,
Peprotech) in complete RPMI media (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 20mM HEPES, 1mM sodium
pyruvate, 0.05mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2mM L-glutamine, 100µg/ml streptomycin and
100µg/ml penicillin). On day 2, OT-I T cells (2×106/well) were spin-infected with lentiviral
pools supplemented with protamine sulfate (5 µg/mL) in 24-well plates coated with
retronectin (5µg/mL) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 15. Typically ~50×106 OT-1 T
cells were infected for each pool. Following infection, OT-I cells were cultured with IL-7
(2.5ng/mL), IL-15 (50ng/mL) and IL-2 (2ng/mL, BioLegend) in complete RPMI media. On

day 5, live cells were enriched using a dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi), and infected cells
(20–25% Thy1.1+) were positively selected based on the Thy1.1 marker (Stemcell
Technologies) to 50–60% Thy1.1 positivity. T cells (5×106) were injected i.v. into C57BL/6
mice bearing day 14 B16-Ova tumors (2×105 tumor cells injected on day 0), 15 mice per
shRNA pool (number of animals chosen to provide sufficient cells for T cell isolation and
PCR). Genomic DNA was isolated from 5×106 enriched OT-I cells as the start population
for deep sequencing. Seven days later, shRNA-expressing T cells (CD8+Vα2+Vβ5+Thy1.1+)
were isolated by flow cytometry from tumors, spleens, tumor-draining lymph nodes and
irrelevant lymph nodes. Genomic DNA was isolated (Qiagen) and deep-sequencing
templates were generated by PCR of the shRNA cassette. Representation of shRNAs in each
pool was analyzed by deep sequencing using an Illumina Genome Analyzer47. Data were
normalized using the average reads of control shRNAs in each pool. Kinase/phosphatase
genes were selected for the secondary screen based on expression levels in T cells
(Immunological Genome Project, http://www.immgen.org/). For the secondary screen, ~10
additional shRNAs were synthesized for each gene (IDT) for a total of ~15 shRNAs per
gene. These focused pools contained 85 negative-control shRNAs. Two control shRNAs
(one for RFP, one for luciferase) showed some enrichment in tumors relative to spleen (4.0
and 5.1-fold, respectively). Cut-off in the secondary screen was defined as >3 shRNA, with
>4 fold enrichment in tumors relative to spleen. Data from primary and secondary screens
are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
T cell isolation from tumors

Author Manuscript

B16-Ova melanomas were cut into small pieces in petri dishes containing 5mL of PBS, 2%
FBS and washed with PBS. Tumors were resuspended in 15 mL RPMI supplemented with
2% FBS, 50U/mL Collagenase Type IV (Invitrogen), 20U/mL DNase (Roche); samples
were incubated at 37° C for 2 hours, and tissue was further dissociated using a gentleMACS
Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech). Suspensions were washed three times with PBS and passed
through a 70 µM strainer. Lymphocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and
then either analyzed or sorted by flow cytometry using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences).
Quantification of T cell enrichment in tumors by flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Individual shRNAs were cloned into lentiviral vectors encoding five different reporter
proteins (GFP, TFP, RFP or Ametrine fluorescent proteins, Thy1.1). Cytokine-pretreated
OT-I T cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors driving expression of a single shRNA/
reporter; 1×106 T cells of each population were mixed and co-injected i.v. into C57BL/6
mice bearing day 14 B16-Ova tumors. Seven days later, T cell populations were identified
by flow cytometry based on co-introduced reporters. Fold-enrichment in tumors compared
to spleen was calculated based on the percentage of OT-I T cells in each organ expressing a
particular reporter. In other experiments, 2×106 OT-I CD8 or TRP-1 CD4 T cells were
transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding Ppp2r2d or LacZ shRNAs (Thy1.1 reporter) and
injected into mice bearing day 14 B16-Ova (for OT-I T cells) or B16 (for TRP-1 T cells)
tumors. On day 7, absolute numbers of shRNA-expressing T cells were determined in
tumors and spleens.

T cell migration, proliferation and cytokine secretion

Author Manuscript

OT-I T cells expressing LacZ or Ppp2r2d shRNAs were purified using the Thy1.1 reporter
and cultured in complete RPMI media without added cytokines for 24 hours. Live cells
isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Sigma) were labeled with CFSE
(carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester, Invitrogen), and 2×106 labeled cells were
injected into mice bearing day 14 B16-Ova tumors. CFSE dilution was quantified by flow
cytometry at 24 hours as well as days 3, 5 and 7 following transfer. In addition, intracellular
staining was performed on days 3, 5 and 7 for IFNγ, TNFα and isotype controls (BD).
T cell apoptosis

Author Manuscript

Cytokine pre-treated OT-I cells were transduced with LacZ or Ppp2r2d shRNAs and
injected into mice bearing day 14 B16-Ova tumors. After 7 days, intracellular staining was
performed using an activated caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling) and CD8/Thy1.1 doublepositive T cells were gated in the FACS analysis.
Treatment of tumors by adoptive T cell transfer
B16-Ova cells (2×105) were injected s.c. into female C57BL/6 mice (10 weeks of age). On
day 12, mice bearing tumors of similar size were divided into 7 groups (7–9 mice/group).
Anti-CD3/CD28 bead activated CD4 TRP-1 or/and CD8 OT-I T cells infected with Ppp2r2d
or LacZ shRNA vectors (2×106 T cells each) were injected i.v. on days 12 and day 17. For
the treatment of B16 tumors, mice were treated at day 10 with anti-CD3/CD28 bead
activated CD4 TRP-1 and CD8 pmel-1 T cells expressing Ppp2r2d or LacZ shRNAs (3×106
T cells each). Tumor size was measured every three days following transfer and calculated
as length × width. Mice with tumors ≥20 mm on the longest axis were sacrificed.

Quantification of Ppp2r2d protein levels by mass spectrometry

Author Manuscript

A previously reported approach for absolute quantification (AQUA) of proteins from cell
lysates by mass spectrometry was used to measure the effect of Ppp2r2d shRNA expression
at the protein level48. This strategy is based on a ‘selective reaction monitoring’ approach in
which a synthetic peptide with incorporated stable isotopes is used as an internal standard
for mass spectrometry analysis. OT-I cells expressing LacZ or Ppp2r2d shRNAs were sorted
to purity using FACS. Cells (1×106) were lysed in 1ml of MPER extraction reagent (Pierce)
containing a Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma), 1mM EDTA and 1mM PMSF for 15
minutes on ice with occasional vortexing. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the
protein supernatant was filtered (0.2µm SpinX centrifuge filter, Costar). Protein
concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Biorad) and UV280 nm analysis
(Nanodrop instrument); 0.1 mg of cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained
with Coomassie blue reagent (Pierce). Gel bands corresponding to a MW range of 45–
60kDa were excised followed by in-gel digestion of proteins with trypsin. Eluted peptides
were spiked with 300 fmol of isotopically labeled Ppp2r2d (FFEEPEDPSS[13C-15N-R]OH) and Actin B (GYSFTTTAE[13C-15N-R]-OH) peptides (21st Century Biochemicals)
for quantification by LC-MS/MS (LTQ XL Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific). The Ppp2r2d
peptide was chosen from a region of the protein that differs from other regulatory subunits
of PP2A. Initially, a LC-MS/MS run of a LacZ shRNA sample was analyzed to localize the

Ppp2r2d and Actin B peptides that were being monitored. The AQUA peptides co-eluted
with the corresponding endogenous peptides from the reverse-phase column, yet their higher
MW (10 Da) enabled the ratio of peak intensity for endogenous and AQUA peptides to be
determined using abundant peptide fragment ions. Triplicate samples were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE - LC-MS/MS and statistical significance was determined using Graphpad Prism
6.0 software using a two-sided Student t-test (F test, * p=0.0062).

Figure 1. In vivo RNAi discovery of immunotherapy targets

a In vivo discovery approach for negative regulators of T cell function in tumors. T cells
infected with shRNA libraries were injected into tumor-bearing mice; shRNAs that enabled
T cell accumulation in tumors were identified by deep sequencing of the shRNA cassette
from purified T cells. b, Deep sequencing data: shRNA sequence reads from tumors,
irrelevant (irLN) and draining lymph nodes (dLN) versus spleen. Upper row: sequence reads
for all genes in a pool, lower row: individual genes (LacZ, negative control). Dashed lines
indicate a deviation by log2 from diagonal.
