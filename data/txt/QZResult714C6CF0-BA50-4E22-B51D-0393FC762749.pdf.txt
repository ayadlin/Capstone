ABSTRACT
The recent research shows that the inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
pathway is a promising therapeutic option for patients who progress after treatment
with the novel mutant-selective EGFR-TKIs. For propose to find a nontoxic drug to
reverse the acquired gefitinib resistance, we examined whether the Liver X Receptors
agonist GW3965 affect gefitinib resistance of HCC827/GR-8-2 cells. Cell viability
was measured by CCK-8 assay. Levels of NF-κB, p-AKT and caspases were detected
by Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemical analysis was used to detect the
expression of NF-κB, p-AKT intracellularly. Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest
was measured by Flow cytometry assay. And results revealed that more than 90%
of HCC827/GR-8-2 cells lived upon treatment with gefitinib at a dose of 5μM for 48h.
However, when under the combine treatment of GW3965 (5μM) & gefitinib(5μM),
cell death rate was increased observably. Co-administration of gefitinib & GW3965
induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Additionally, we observed a dosedependent- down-regulation of NF-κB in HCC827/GR-8-2 cells treated with gefitinib
& GW3965. GW3965 and gefitinib synergistically decreased cell proliferation and
induced apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway in gefitinib resistant cells.
These findings support our hypothesis that GW3965 could act as a useful drug to
reverse the gefitinib resistance.

kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib [3]. Gefitinib,
as the first generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(EGFR-TKIs), has been developed to be the recommended
treatment to those NSCLC patients which harbor activating
EGFR mutation [4]. The clinical use of EGFR-TKIs for
advanced-stage NSCLC patients has revolutionized the
treatment of the disease (disease control can be achieved
in about 80% of the patient) [5]. Nonetheless, most
patients who initially sensitive to gefitinib will develop
acquire resistance within 6-12 months of therapy [6]. Drug
resistance is a major obstacle in the NSCLC therapy. The

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer and gefitinib
resistance
Lung cancer now is the leading cause in cancerrelated mortality worldwide [1]. Among the several
different pathologic types, non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) has been the most common lung cancer type
[2]. About 10% of NSCLC patients can be identified the
mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Those patients have
a rapid and generally clinical response to EGFR tyrosine

[7]. Until today, there is no effective strategy that has been
found to overcome gefitinib resistance.

RESULTS

LXR

HCC827/GR-8-2 cell line remains gefitinib
resistance but did not have T790M mutation

LXRs are nuclear receptors with mounting
evidence pointing to functional roles in a variety of
malignancies recently. And LXRs are members of the
nuclear receptor family. LXRα (also known as NR1H3)
is expressed in metabolically active tissue. And LXRβ
(also known as NR1H2) is expressed ubiquitously
[8]. Targeting LXRs is a promising strategy for
cancer therapy. LXRs agonist will effect on the tumor
environment and the receptor status [9]. An earlier study
demonstrated that the synergy between the activated
LXR and EGFR antagonists act as a critical target
regulating the growth of cancer cells [10]. And previous
research had shown that the LXR agonist GW3965
could inhibit the NF-κB transcriptional activity [11].
Based on the close relationship of LXR and downstream
of EGFR signaling pathway, and furtherly considering
our preliminary results, we hypothesis that LXR agonist
GW3965 can reverse the acquired gefitinib resistance
by inhibiting NF-κB expression, and the research would
provide a useful option for clinical treatment of acquired
gefitinib resistant lung cancer.

We already established the EGFR-TKI-resistant
cell lines [12]. While HCC827 cell line was still sensitive
to gefitinib, HCC827/GR-8-2 was highly resistance to
gefitinib (Figure 1A). From the results, the gefitinib IC50
values of HCC827 cell line and the HCC827/GR-8-2
cell line were (72.32±1.98)×10-3 μM and 34.324±1.36
μM respectively (Figure 1B). Gefitinib significantly
suppressed cell growth in HCC827 cell line. Compare
with the parental HCC827 cell line, the HCC827/GR-8-2
cell line were 474.6 folds more resistance to gefitinib.
We conducted direct DNA sequencing of EGFR at
exons 18-22 on the HCC827/GR-8-2 cell line to examine
the common mechanisms of acquired gefitinib resistance,
the T790M mutation. But the T790M mutation was not
observed in our HCC827/GR-8-2 cell line (Figure 1C).
The EGFR expression was not significantly different
between HCC827 cells and HCC827/GR-8-2 cells. And
the expression of EGFR in HCC827/GR-8-2 cell line
was almost the same (Figure 1D). We found that NFκB expression was not significantly different between
HCC827 cells and HCC827/GR-8-2 cells. Also did the

the high concentration, we can find the crystal of gefitinib), the cells turned round. B. The IC50 value of HCC827/GR-8-2 was 34.324±1.36

was observed.

shown in (Figure 2B), GW3965 significantly increased
the expression of LXRβ mRNA, while the LXRα mRNA
expression did not change a lot.

Effects of GW3965 and the combination of
gefitinib with GW3965 on HCC827/GR-8-2 cell
viability

Next, we investigated whether GW3965 could
inhibit the cell viability or not. Different concentrations
of GW3965 (1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μM) were added in the
HCC827/GR-8-2 cells for 48h.The results show that
GW3965 have little effect on the cell viability in HCC827/
GR-8-2 cells (Figure 2A). To further investigate the
mechanisms of GW3965’s effect and its modulation on
the LXRα and LXRβ mRNA, RT-PCR were conducted.
Previous study already revealed that GW3965 can upregulate the expression level of LXRβ mRNA [12].
Similarly, we find that the up-regulation of the expression

Herein, we co-conducted GW3965 (1, 5, 10μM)
and gefitinib (5μM) on HCC827/GR-8-2 cells for further
analysis whether GW3965 could overcome the gefitinib
resistance or not. These CCK-8 assay results suggested
GW3965 plus gefitinib significantly suppressed cell
viability (Figure 3A). GW3965 had synergistic effects
on reversing the gefitinib-resistance (p<0.0001). And the
colony forming assays further proved that GW3965 (5μM)

The total RNA was harvested from these cells to examine the LXRα mRNA and LXRβ mRNA expression. GW3965 could activate LXRβ

combination of GW3965 and gefitinib could markedly decrease the HCC827/GR-8-2 cells growth.

suppressing NF-κB expression in HCC827/GR-82 cell line in vitro

could decrease the drug-resistance cell proliferation. Same
results were observed in gefitinib (5μM) treated group. But
the combination of GW3965 (5μM) and gefitinib (5μM)
could markedly (p<0.01) decrease the gefitinib-resistant
cell growth (Figure 3B).

Evidence indicates that the NF-κB pathway
plays an important role in the development of chemoresistance [13]. Also, NF-κB plays an important role in
the induction of apoptosis and drug resistance in cancer
cells [14]. The inhibition of NF-κB can alter a number
of downstream signals including the suppression of antiapoptotic proteins and induction of apoptosis [15]. To
determine whether GW3965 reversed gefitinib-resistance
via apoptosis, we next explore the effect of GW3965
and/or gefitinib on NF-κB and caspases level in cells.
We detected the apoptosis-related protein expression.
Western blot analysis showed that PARP, bax, caspase-3
and C-caspase-9 was up-regulated significantly in
GW3965 plus gefitinib-treated group compared with
GW3965 or gefitinib-treated groups (Figure 5A). On the
contrary, the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 intracellularly
was decreased markedly upon the combination treatment
of GW3965 with gefitinib compared with GW3965
or gefitinib alone. NF-κB expression was decreased
obviously among GW3965 plus gefitinib-treated groups
compared to control or gefitinib-treated groups (Figure
5B). We treated HCC827/GR-8-2 cells with GW3965
(5μM). And NF-κB expression was markedly deceased
in GW3965-treated cells in a time depending manner.
And the drug treatment seemed have little effect on
the MET expression (Figure 5C). The combination of

GW3965 increases gefitinib-induced apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest in HCC827/GR-8-2 cell line
We used flow cytometry to prove that GW3965
could increase cytotoxicity of gefitinib. As shown
in (Figure 4A), when treated with 5 μM gefitinib, the
cell apoptosis rate was not increased compared with
the control group. And the apoptosis cells in GW3965
(5 μM) –treated group was not increased, either.
The differences in the proliferation rates between the
GW3965 (5 μM) group and the GW3965 (5 μM) with
gefitinib (5 μM) group were significant (both P<0.001)
(Figure 4A). The inhibition rate was increased (P <
0.001). The results demonstrated that GW3965 could
significantly increase the apoptosis which induced by
gefitinib in drug-resistant cells. And also, as shown in
(Figure 4B), GW3965 could induce the increasing in
the G1 phase population in HCC827/GR-8-2 cell line.
S phase arrest along with a significant decrease in the
number of cells was observed after treatment with the
GW3965 (5 μM) and gefitinib(5 μM) for 48h. The
percentages in the S phase were decreased. The results
revealed that GW3965 could enhance cell cycle arrest
when co-treated with gefitinib.

Figure 4: Flowcytometry revealed GW3965 induced apoptosis and G1/S cell cycle arrest. A. When treated with 5 μM
gefitinib or 5 μM GW3965, the cell apoptosis rate was not significantly different from control group. But cell apoptosis rate was higher in
cells treated with gefitinib 5μM &GW3965 5μM compared with the single drug groups. And the p value <0.001(gefitinib 5μM verse the
gefitinib 5μM &GW3965 5μM). B. The combine treatment of GW3965 and gefitinb induced the G1/S cell cycle arrest in HCC827/GR-8-2

GW3965 with gefitinib could significantly inhibit the
NF-κB expression compared to the gefitinib-treated
cells. Moreover, the immunocytochemical proved that
GW3965 inhibited NF-κB expression in a time (Figure
5D) and dose depending manner (Figure 5E) in HCC827/
GR-8-2 cell line. Recent research showed that the NFκB could be activated following AKT phosphorylation
[16]. Moreover, p-AKT expression was significantly
up-regulated when cells were treated with gefitinib. As
shown in Figure 5D, 5E, in combination with GW3965,
the expression of p-AKT was down regulated compared

with gefitinib-treated group. Above results indicated
that GW3965 combined with gefitinib has a synersgistic
effect. Our in vitro studies investigating that the NF-κB
expression and consequent tumor cell survival can be
suppressed by LXR ligands GW3965.

The specific inhibition of NF-κB down-regulate
the gefitinib resistance
PDTC can specific decrease intracellular expression
level of NF-κB in dose dependent manner [17]. Indeed,

Figure 5: GW3965 sensitizes gefitinib by inhibiting NF-κB activation. A. In combination of gefitinib, GW3965 enhances

apoptosis of HCC827/GR-8-2 cells. The expression of caspase 3 and C-caspase 9 were detected as well as the Bcl-2, Bax and PARP.
The IOD analysis show the fold changes of the PARP, Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 and C-caspase 9. B. GW3965 sensitizes gefitinib by AKT
and NF-κB expression. When treated with gefitinib, AKT and NF-κB were activated. And GW3965 could inhibit the activation of them
when the existence of gefitinib. And GW3965 could not influence the expression of EGFR and Met. C. The HCC827/GR-8-2 cells were
treated with GW3965 (5μM) for 0h, 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h. The activation of NF-κB intracellular was inhibited significantly by GW3965.
But the expression of Met was not change a lot. D. The immunohistochemistry were performed to detect the expression of NF-κB and
p-AKT intracellular. E. The HCC827/GR-8-2 cells were treated with negative control, GW3965 (5μM), gefitinib (5μM), gefitinib (5μM)
& GW3965 (5μM), gefitinib (5μM) & GW3965 (10μM), gefitinib (5μM) & GW3965 (20μM) for 72h. As the doses of GW3965 grew, the
inhibition of the NF-κB and p-AKT expression became more significantly.

the expression levels of NF-κB were investigated in
PDTC-treated NSCLC cell lines. For this purpose
HCC827/GR-8-2 cells were treated with different
concentrations of gefitinib, and with combined treatment
of PDTC (25 μM). Indeed, we observed that in our
experimental conditions PDTC and gefitinib decreased
the drug resistance significantly (Figure 6A). As shown
in Figure 6B, in comparison to control, a significantly
decrease in the expression level of NF-κB was observed
in the cells after treatment with 25 μM PDTC for 72h.
While the single agent gefitinib could not decrease the
expression of NF-κB, the combination of PDTC (25 μM)
with gefitinib significantly decreased the concentrations of
intracellular NF-κB respectively (Figure 6B). We further
aimed to determine the influence of PDTC on the gefitinib
sensitivity by identification of IC50 values under the drug
treatments. CCK-8 assay (Figure 6C) results showed the
gefitinib IC50 values in the control group, and the PDTC
(25 μM) group were 14.84 μM, 11.18 μM, respectively.
The colony formation assay showed the inhibition of
NF-κB can markedly attenuate the cell proliferation
(Figure 6D). Flow cytometry analysis showed remarkable

increase of early apoptotic cells upon the inhibition of
NF-κB. Figure 6E show the treatment of PDTC induced
the apoptosis. The inhibition rate was significantly higher
in cells treated with PDTC group than in cells that were
only treated with gefitnib. With the co-treating of PDTC
and gefitinib, the percentage of apoptosis was increased
remarkable (Figure 6E). While both agents decreased the
cells viability in dose dependent manner, caspases changes
clearly indicated synergy action of gefitinib and PDTC
(Figure 6F). As treated with PDTC, the expression levels
of caspases were increased compared with the control
group. And the apoptotic proteins in PDTC–gefitinbtreated group were increased, too. The results suggested
the inhibition of NF-κB had significantly effects on
reversing the gefitinib-resistance.

able to increase the protein levels of NF-κB. We further
aimed to determine the influence of LPS on the GW3965induced reversing of gefitinib resistance by identification
the important role of NF-κB in gefitinib resistance. For
this purpose gefitinib resistance cells were treated with
LPS(2μg/ml), gefitinib(5 μM), and with combined
treatment of LPS & gefitinib in concentrations selected.
A strong LPS induced activation of NF-κB was observed
in cells (Figure 7A). Data are summarized in Figure 7B
clearly showing that NF-κB was markedly higher in
LPS-treated (2μg/ml) groups as compared to control
group. The IC50 values of gefitinib in the gefitinib(5
μM) group, the GW3965 (5 μM) with gefitinib(5 μM)
group, and the LPS(2μg/ml) and GW3965 (5 μM) with
gefitinib(5 μM) group were 8.26 μM, 3.99 μM, and 6.36
μM, respectively (Figure 7C). These CCK-8 assay results
suggested cellular resistance to gefitinib was restored
after the treatment of the LPS(2μg/ml). Interestingly,
LPS treatment did not result in decreased cell apoptosis.
After optimization of the LPS dose (2μg/ml) and time

course (72 h), the GW3965 with gefitinib-induced cell
apoptosis rate was decreased (Figure 7D). On the other
hand, LPS alone or concomitantly to gefitinib activated
the NF-κB activity indicating that apoptosis was a result
of NF-κB inhibition. The colony formation assay showed
the restored expression of NF-κB could up-regulate cell
proliferation. When combined treatment of gefitinib and
LPS and GW3965 was applied in mentioned dose, the
percentage of cell colonies were significantly decreased
(Figure 7E). And, LPS induced increase expression of
NF-κB can further decrease caspases proteins. The NF-κB
overexpression clearly showing that the expression levels
of caspase 3, caspase 9 and bax, were markedly lower in
cells compared with the gefitinib and LPS and GW3965
group (Figure 7F).

therapeutic approaches to solve the EGFR-TKIs

resistance. Surprisingly, with the using of GW3965 could
not only re-sensitize the treatments of EGFR-TKIs but
also might overcome the acquired resistance as the dose
rise [12]. Evidences have emerged that activation of LXR
inhibits various types of cancer cells’ proliferation [19].
More importantly, recent researches have been proved the
LXR agonist could significantly inhibit the activation of
EGFR downstream pathways, which indicates that LXR
agonist is a potential drug that could reverse the acquired
resistance to gefitinib [20]. Our preliminary study also
demonstrated that addition of LXR agonist could inhibit
lung cancer cells (resistance to gefitinib) proliferation,
induce cancer cells’ apoptosis and significantly increase
cancer cells’ sensitivity to gefitinib by the inhibition of
AKT phosphorylation [12]. The activation of the LXR in
different types of cancer cells resulted in significant cell
apoptosis [21]. The results emerged from these studies
raise the possibility that the nuclear receptor LXR may
be a potential drug target in multiple cancers especially
in NSCLC.
LXR could be activated by the agonist GW3965
[22]. And LXR agonist could reverse the increase of
NF-κB-p65 protein expression [23]. Recent research
demonstrated that GW3965 can suppress the activation
of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. The p65 subunit
of NF-κB binding to the NF-κB consensus site could be
greatly inhibited when pretreated with GW3965 [24].
NF-κB family can activate a series of gene transcription
and control cell signaling pathways and affect cellular
functions in a wide range of biological process [25].

As a transcription factor complex, NF-κB could be
activated by cellular stresses, such as chemotherapeutic
agents; upon induction, NF-κB translocate to the nucleus
where it binds to specific DNA sequences in target genes
involved in carcinogenesis, cell survival, and growth
regulation [26]. NF-κB promote the tumor development
and progression [27]. NF-κB activation will drive tumor
cell survival [28]. Previous research also suggest that
the NF-κB pathway correlates with the development of
chemo-resistance, at least in part by the inhibition of NFκB [29]. NSCLC containing EGFR mutation show the
elevated NF-κB activity [30]. NF-κB activation could
replace the oncogenic EGFR signaling pathway in the
effective and persistent inhibition of target gene when
EGFR harboring mutation [31]. Current studies reveal that
NF-κB activation promoted resistance to EGFR-TKIs and
might be a therapeutic strategy for EGFR-TKI resistance
[32]. The NF-κB signaling pathway activation is a critical
adaptive survival mechanism engaged by EGFR oncogene
inhibitors [28]. Also, NF-κB is implicated in the induction
of apoptosis in cancers, especially acquired drug resistance
cancer cells [33]. NF-κB activation confers the generating
of gefitinib resistance in lung cancer [34]. The inhibition
of NF-κB is sufficient to reduce the viability of cells that
acquired EGFR-TKI resistance. Also the inhibition of NFκB can activate a number of downstream events including
suppression of anti-apoptotic genes and induction of
apoptosis [35].
The study we conducted showed the forced
activation of the LXR with highly synthetic agonists

GW3965 could inhibit the expression of NF-κB (p65)
in a time dependent manner. NF-κB in HCC827/GR-82 cells was down-regulate markedly when treated with
combination of GW3965 & gefitinib. Therefore, the
down-regulation of NF-κB can also negatively regulate
the expression of apoptosis proteins such as Bax,
Caspase-3 and C-Caspase-9. The induction of apoptosis
related proteins further regulated the resistant cells. This
study demonstrates that NF-κB plays a significant role in
acquired gefitinib resistance and the GW3965-induced
inhibition of NF-κB will activate the downstream
apoptosis gene products (Figure 8). For confirm the
hypothesis that the GW3965-induced-reversing of
resistance was the result of NF-κB inhibition, we
furtherly conducted the NF-κB inhibition assays.
Since the PDTC has been described to induce NF-κB
inhibition and cell death in different types of cancer
cells [36], intracellular NF-kB levels were evaluated
after treatment with 25 μM of PDTC for 72 h. The
expression level of NF-κB can be inhibited by PDTC,
which is logically consistent with the previous findings
[37]. However, our results revealed that the inhibition of
NF-κB at the same time down-regulate the IC50 value
of PDTC-treated cells to gefitinib. On the contrary, a
strong LPS induced increased expression of NF-κB was

observed in gefitinib resistant cells. Interestingly, LPS
treatment did not result in increased cell proliferation
in HCC827/GR-8-2 cells. Nevertheless, treatment with
LPS can restore the gefitinib resistance.
However, our findings do not entirely explain the
mechanisms of that the liver X receptors agonist GW3965
re-sensitizes gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines harboring
EGFR mutant to gefitinib treatment. Future study will be
needed to assess the efficacy and clinical utility of the
LXR agonists such as GW3965 as a potential clinical
candidate as they are becoming useful and available for
clinical testing. The frequently adverse effects seen in TKI
treatment require further investigation. A well-adjusted
balance between efficacy and adverse effects is desirable.
No effects on overall survival were reported. Therefore,
further studies are required.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and generation of gefitinib-resistance
HCC827 cells
GW3965 and DMSO were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Cell counting kit-8 was
purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). RPMI
15810

Oncotarget

1640 (Gibco) were supplemented with 10% fetal bovin
serum (FBS) (Wisent, Canada). Gefitinib (Iressa, Gef)
was purchased from AstraZeneca. Penicillin-Streptomycin
Solution was purchased from Gibco. PDTC and LPS were
purchased from Beyotime, Beijing. The antibodies against
caspases, NF-κB, β-actin, AKT, p-AKT, PTEN, EGFR
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA). HCC827 cell line is a non-small cell lung
cancer cell line harboring the EGFR exon 19 deletion (Del
E746-A750), and the cell line was purchased from Cell
Bank, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese
Academy of Sciences. And HCC827/GR cell lines were
cultured in the Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. HCC827/GR cell
line has been used as a gefitinib-resistance cell model. We
exposed the HCC827 cells to increasing the concentration
of gefitinib according to previously described method
[38]. Finally, the HCC827 cells generated stable gefitinib
resistance. HCC827/GR-8-2 cell line was isolated and it
was confirmed resistance to gefitinib independently. The
resistant cell lines were passed more than 25 times in the
presence of gefitinib and maintained the resistance which
was confirmed by CCK-8 assays. HCC827 cell lines were
maintained concomitantly without gefitinib. So the parental
cells HCC827 was still sensitive to gefitinib and we
examined it every 5 passages. HCC827 cells and HCC827/
GR cells were maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented
with 10% heating-inactivated FBS and 1% PenicillinStreptomycin Solution. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
