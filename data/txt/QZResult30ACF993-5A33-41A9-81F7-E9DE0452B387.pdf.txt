ABSTRACT
Background: We have previously shown that an intensified preoperative regimen
including oxaliplatin plus raltitrexed and 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (OXATOM/
FUFA) during preoperative pelvic radiotherapy produced promising results in locally
advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Preclinical evidence suggests that the scheduling of
bevacizumab may be crucial to optimize its combination with chemo-radiotherapy.
Patients and methods: This non-randomized, non-comparative, phase II study was
conducted in MRI-defined high-risk LARC. Patients received three biweekly cycles of
OXATOM/FUFA during RT. Bevacizumab was given 2 weeks before the start of chemoradiotherapy, and on the same day of chemotherapy for 3 cycles (concomitant-schedule
A) or 4 days prior to the first and second cycle of chemotherapy (sequential-schedule
B). Primary end point was pathological complete tumor regression (TRG1) rate.
Results: The accrual for the concomitant-schedule was early terminated
because the number of TRG1 (2 out of 16 patients) was statistically inconsistent
with the hypothesis of activity (30%) to be tested. Conversely, the endpoint was
reached with the sequential-schedule and the final TRG1 rate among 46 enrolled
patients was 50% (95% CI 35%–65%). Neutropenia was the most common grade

≥3 toxicity with both schedules, but it was less pronounced with the sequential
than concomitant-schedule (30% vs. 44%). Postoperative complications occurred in
8/15 (53%) and 13/46 (28%) patients in schedule A and B, respectively. At 5 year
follow-up the probability of PFS and OS was 80% (95%CI, 66%–89%) and 85%
(95%CI, 69%–93%), respectively, for the sequential-schedule.
Conclusions: These results highlights the relevance of bevacizumab scheduling to
optimize its combination with preoperative chemo-radiotherapy in the management
of LARC.

A concomitant schedule, in which bevacizumab was
administered concurrentlyy to CT, was initially evaluated.
Thereafter, a sequential schedule, in which bevacizumab
was given 4 days before CT, was also evaluated in order
to explore the clinical relevance of “vessel normalization”.
The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of
TRG1. However, considering the controversial prognostic
value of short term pathological end points and the paucity
of data on long-term outcomes of LARC patients, we also
report on these findings with a prolonged follow-up.

INTRODUCTION
The evolution of preoperative multimodality
treatment has improved the local control of locally
advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Distant metastases,
however, remain a clinical challenge and more effective
systemic approaches are needed [1]. LARC comprises a
heterogeneous group of tumors in which outcomes vary
significantly depending on prognostic factors, namely T
and N stage, involvement of the circumferential resection
margin (CRM) and low-lying location [2]. The highresolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows
the preoperative identification of high-risk features,
enabling patient selection for risk-adapted treatment
[2]. In such high-risk LARC patients we have recently
reported promising results from a phase-2 trial based
on an original intensified preoperative chemotherapy
(CT) regimen including oxaliplatin plus raltitrexed and
5-fluorouracil modulated by folinic acid (OXATOM/
FUFA) at full systemic doses, during preoperative pelvic
radiotherapy (RT). High rates of complete (40%) and
near-complete (25%) pathologic tumor regression were
observed, with a 5-year freedom from recurrence of
80% and a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 87% [3]. On
the basis of preclinical and clinical data the integration
of bevacizumab into fluoropyrimidines-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been extensively investigated
in phase II studies [4, 5]. However, results overall have
been modest and concerns regarding increased surgical
morbidity have been raised [6]. Several evidences suggest
that the chemo-sensitizing activity exerted by anti-VEGF
agents depends on the so-called “vessel to normalization,
in which a reduction of tumor vessel abnormalities results
in more efficient delivery of drugs and oxygen to cancer
cells [7]. Although genetic studies have shown prolonged
maintenance of vascular normalization [8], in preclinical
models pharmacological VEGF inhibitors induced a
transient vessel normalization, occurring a few days after
anti-VEGF administration [9, 10]. Therefore, rescheduling
of bevacizumab relative to CT and RT could be of critical
importance to optimize the efficacy of the combination
treatment. On these basis we conducted a phase-2 study in
MRI-defined high-risk LARC patients, in order to evaluate
the addition of bevacizumab to OXATOM/FUFA during
preoperative RT.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics and treatment
Between December 2006 and July 2011 16 patients
were enrolled in schedule A (concomitant) and 46 in
schedule B (sequential). Demographic and baseline
disease characteristics by treatment schedule are shown
in Table 1. Most patients had more than one high-risk
factor. Among patients with radial margin ≤5 mm from
the mesorectal fascia (MRF), evaluated by MRI and
considered to have potentially positive CRM, 4/13 (31%)
in schedule A and 29/35 (83%) in schedule B showed
tumor location within 2 mm of the MRF. All T3N0-1
tumors had a potentially positive CRM and/or extramural
extension ≥5 mm.
All patients in schedule A and all but 1 patient
in schedule B received the planned dose of RT. The
radiation treatment was completed in a median of 39
(range, 35–45) and 36 (range, 33–49) days in schedule
A and B, respectively. One patient in each group did not
receive the third cycle of chemotherapy due to severe and
persistent neutropenia and diarrhea. Overall, the median
relative dose intensities of cytotoxic drugs were: 87%
and 97% for oxaliplatin, 87% and 97% for raltitrexed,
83% and 92% for 5-FU, 94% and 100% for bevacizumab,
in schedule A and B, respectively. The only patient with
metastatic disease enrolled in schedule A and 4 out of 7
metastatic patients in schedule B received two additional
cycles of chemotherapy after the end of RT. One patient
in schedule A with a complete clinical response refused
surgery. The median interval between the end of RT and
TME was 9 weeks for both schedule A (range, 7–14) and
B (range, 7–15).

Outcome

A median of 32 (range, 19–62) and 27 (range, 12–108)
lymph nodes per patient were harvested in schedule A and
B, respectively. Pathological nodal downstaging occurred
in 32/43 (74%) patients (Table 3). In schedule B, 4 patients
with TRG1 (2 with baseline metastatic disease) revealed
pathological nodal involvement. Overall pCR rate was 41%
and 30/46 (65%) patients had a ypT0–2N0 status (Table 2).
As provided by the selective adjuvant policy
adopted in the study, 5 patients in schedule A and 13/16
patients in schedule B (3 patients with baseline metastatic
disease and R0/R1 resection refused further treatment),
received post-operative FOLFOX4 after a median of 7
weeks (schedule A, range: 7–9; schedule B, range: 4–15)
from surgery. In schedule A, with a median follow-up
at the time of analysis of 91 (range, 84–96) months, 2
patients had distant recurrence, 3 patients had both local
and distant recurrence and 5 patients died.

Surgical outcome and pathological tumor responses
are summarized in Table 2. Notably, the incomplete
resection in schedule B pertained only to metastatic
disease. There were no instances of disease progression
during treatment.
According to the preplanned first-stage analysis, the
accrual for schedule A was terminated since only 2 TRG1
responses were identified. Conversely, in schedule B, 8/15
patients showed a TRG1 in the first stage and 23/46 (50%;
95% CI, 35%–65%) in the second stage. Importantly, TRG1
status was achieved independently of the pre-treatment
clinical stage (Table 3). In addition, 15 patients (33%; 95%
CI, 21%–47%) obtained a near complete tumor regression
with schedule B (TRG2, Table 2). Pathological tumor
downstaging occurred in 39/46 (85%) patients (Table 3).

In schedule B after a median follow up of 54 (range,
41–83) months, 37/46 (80%) patients continued to be
disease-free. One patient (ypN+) had a local recurrence,
3 patients (including 1 with early interruption of CRT
and 1 ypN+) had both local and distant recurrences and
2 patients (both ypN+) had distant recurrence. Of note,
4 patients with baseline metastatic disease (3 achieving a
TRG1 response) were still disease-free. Six patients died
of rectal cancer specific causes. At 5-years follow-up the
probability of Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS was
80% (95%CI, 66%-89%) and, 85% (95%CI, 69%-93%),
respectively, for schedule B (Figure 1).

B, as opposed to 1/7 (14%) in schedule A, occurred only
after the end of CRT, thus not causing treatment delays or
dose modifications. No cardiac or thromboembolic events,
hemorrhages or perforations were observed.
Postoperative complications occurred in 8/15 (53%)
and 13/46 (28%) patients in schedule A and B, respectively
(Table 5). Re-operation was necessary in 3 patients (19%)
in schedule A and in 4 patients (9%) in schedule B. One
patient per schedule required a permanent colostomy.
There were no deaths correlated with CRT or surgery in
either treatment schedules.
Moderate or severe late toxicities were reported in
6/15 (40%) and 19/46 (41%) patients in schedule A and B,
respectively (Table 5).

Safety
Treatment induced side effects are summarized
in Table 4. Toxicity profiles were similar between the
two schedules and neutropenia was the most common
grade ≥3 adverse event, but it was short lasting and
easily managed. Notably, severe neutropenia was less
pronounced in schedule B (30% vs. 44%). Furthermore,

bevacizumab with the OXATOM/FUFA regimen during
RT did not meet the primary endpoint.
With the sequential schedule, on the other hand,
the endpoint was reached in both stages of Simon’s
statistical design and the final TRG1 rate was 50% (95%
CI, 35%–65%), slightly better compared to our previous
experience with the same regimen without bevacizumab
(40%) [3]. In addition, a near complete tumor regression
was observed in 15 further patients, with an overall rate
of TRG1/TRG2 responses of 83% (95% CI, 69%–91%),
which was higher compared to our previous experience
without bevacizumab (65%) [3]. Moreover, we should
also point out that most patients enrolled in the current
study had more than one high-risk factor, including 15%
of patients with metastatic disease, who were not included
in our previous experience.
Although four patients with TRG1 had pathological
nodal involvement, the 41% pCR rate is still impressive.
Notably, these results were observed regardless of
pretreatment clinical stage and were reported through a
robust pathological analysis, as proven by the elevated
median number of lymph nodes retrieved. Additional
remarkable findings were the 93% R0 resection rate, the
65% ypT0-2N0 rate, the 80% sphincter-sparing surgery
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

rate and the clinical or pathological complete response
of metastatic sites in 3/7 patients. All this data endorses
the efficacy of the sequential bevacizumab schedule with
OXATOM/FUFA during RT. The consistency of these
findings was corroborated by the long-term outcome of
patients.
Indeed, the 80% 5-year PFS and 85% 5-year OS
indicates a good and durable distant control. These results
are particularly relevant considering the poor prognostic
features of the enrolled patients.
The selective adjuvant policy adopted in our trial
strengthens the value of these findings, minimizing the
influence of the adjuvant therapy on long-term outcome.
Indeed, postoperative FOLFOX4 was delivered only in a
small subgroup of patients. Although there is no general
agreement on the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy
after preoperative CRT [11], there is recent compelling
evidence supporting the use of a risk-adapted strategy
based on pathological findings to select candidates for
CT after surgery [12, 13]. Moreover, recent results of the
randomized phase-2 ADORE study in LARC patients
suggest that those less responsive to fluoropyrimidinebased CRT may benefit from four months of adjuvant
FOLFOX chemotherapy [14].

bevacizumab concomitant to preoperative RT. However,
patient selection in this study, as with most studies
assessing bevacizumab, was not based on MRI criteria
(Table 6 [16–28]). Furthermore, PFS (with a shorter
follow-up) was markedly lower than in our series [18]. A
slightly higher pCR rate of 34% and an additional nearypCR rate of 36% were observed in a phase-2 study, in
which patients received induction chemotherapy with 4
cycles of bevacizumab plus XELOX, followed by CRT
with concurrent capecitabine and bevacizumab. In this
study, MRI selection criteria were used but, unlike in our
study, patients with metastatic disease were not included,
dose of RT was higher and long-term outcome was not
reported [19].
With respect to safety, the combination of
bevacizumab with RT and OXATOM/FUFA was well
tolerated. Toxicities were manageable and similar to those
previously reported with the same CRT regimen without
bevacizumab [3]. Neutropenia was the most common
toxicity but did not decrease the treatment compliance.
Interestingly the incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia
reported for schedule B was lower compared to the
same CRT regimen without or with bevacizumab in the
concomitant schedule. In line with these results, recent
preclinical data shows that the sequential delivery of
antiangiogenic drugs followed by chemotherapy yields a

lower bone marrow toxicity compared to the concomitant
administration [29].
In agreement with some trials evaluating the
integration of bevacizumab in preoperative treatment
(Table 5), we observed high a rate of surgical
complications and re-operation under schedule A, while
postoperative complications in schedule B were relatively
low (Table 5). We hypothesize that the administration of
only two cycles of bevacizumab, and the resulting longer
interval between its last administration and surgery,
may have helped to reduce the occurrence of surgical
complications. However, compared to the 2% rate of
re-operation reported in larger phase III trial in patients
treated with preoperative fluoropyrimidine alone during
RT [30], the 9% rate observed with the sequential schedule
is higher. Nevertheless, this rate is similar to that reported
with other intensified treatment approaches, including our
previous experience without bevacizumab [3, 31]. Notably
when an intensified approach was used in combination
with bevacizumab as preoperative treatment, an even
higher re-operation rate was reported [19].
Our study has some potential limitations that deserve
special consideration. Its major weakness is that it was a
single center, non-randomized phase-2 trial, with a relatively
small sample size. Furthermore, evidence is emerging that a
margin of ≤1 mm from the MRF by MRI may be adequate

to identify patients at risk of CRM involvement [32], as
opposed to the 5 mm threshold previously accepted [33].
A recent multicenter study showed that a cut-off of 2 mm
from the MRF may help select patients in whom an intensive
preoperative treatment is needed [34]. In our study, the tumor
was located within 2 mm of MRF in 83% of patients and
most patients had additional high-risk factors. Moreover,
93% of patients showed clinical lymph node involvement
and 15% had metastatic disease. Therefore, it seems unlikely
that our results were influenced by favorable patient selection.
In conclusion, taking into account the few doses
of bevacizumab associated with preoperative CRT,
its scheduling seems to be crucial to potentiate the
combination. We may hypothesize that, in this setting,
bevacizumab might improve the delivery of cytotoxic
drugs and oxygen to cancer cells through a reduction
of the interstitial fluid pressure (“vessel normalization
effect”), that has been proven to occur few days after a
single drug administration [5], rather than through the
reduction of vessel density (“tumor-starving effect”).

If so, the sequential administration of bevacizumab and
CRT, as opposed to concurrent, exploits this synergism at
best. Of course, further studies are needed to validate this
approach and better understand its underlying molecular
mechanisms. Therefore, we are currently conducting
a phase-3 randomized study comparing the two
bevacizumab schedules in combination with FOLFOX/
OXXEL regimens in metastatic colorectal cancer patients
(OBELICS study, NCT01718873).

Materials and METHODS
The BRANCH (Bevacizumab, RAdiotherapy
aNd CHemotherapy) trial was an open label, nonrandomized, single center, phase-2 clinical study (Eudract
number: 2008-003989-26; Clinicaltrials.gov number:
NCT01481545), approved by the local ethical committee
and conducted in accordance to the Declaration of
Helsinki. Signed written informed consent was obtained
from each patient before accrual.

lower third of the rectum and/or whose radial margin was
≤5 mm from MRF. Tumors with radial margin ≤5 mm from
MRF, defined by MRI, were considered to have potentially
positive CRM. Other main eligibility criteria were: age ≥18
years; ECOG performance status ≤2; adequate bone marrow,
renal, and liver function; absence of concurrent uncontrolled
medical condition; no previous malignant disease.

The study enrolled patients with pathologically
confirmed untreated high-risk rectal adenocarcinoma within 15
cm from the anal margin. High-risk was defined a tumor with
concomitant resectable metastases and/or any of the following
MRI features: T4; anyTN1-2; T3N0 tumors located in the

Figure 2: Treatment schedules.
Baseline work-up was completed within 6
weeks before the registration and included: clinical
examination, laboratory tests, recto-colonoscopy and
endorectal ultrasound; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
serum level; whole body contrast enhanced computed
tomography (CT); MRI of the pelvis. Imaging studies
were blindly reviewed by two radiologists (AP and VG)
and in case of discrepancy the worse TNM was assigned.
Biomarker studies on tumor and blood samples
and [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission
tomography (18FDG-PET) evaluation were also performed
at baseline, during treatment and before surgery. Results of
these studies will be described in separate reports.

mg/m2 followed by raltitrexed, 2.5 mg/m2 on day 1,
and levo-folinic acid, 250 mg/m2 followed by bolus of
5-fluorouracil, 800 mg/m2 on day 2.
Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg was administered 2
weeks before the start of CRT, and on the same day of
oxaliplatin and raltitrexed for 3 cycles (treatment days:
-14, 1, 15 and 29; concomitant schedule A) or 4 days
prior to the first and second cycle of chemotherapy
(treatment days: -4, and 11; sequential schedule B)
(Figure 2). Two additional cycles of chemotherapy
with one bevacizumab infusion, using the previously
employed timing schedule, were allowed after the end of
CRT in patients with metastatic disease.
CRT had to be temporarily stopped in case of
grade ≥3 toxicity. Dose adjustments for adverse events
were reported previously [35]. Total mesorectal excision
(TME) was planned 8 weeks (±1) after the last day
of RT. The choice of surgical procedure for primary
tumor, anterior or abdominal–peritoneal resection, and
metastases was based on restaging. Fecal diversion
to protect the anastomosis was performed by means
of a loop ileostomy, which was later reversed after
endoscopic assessment of anastomotic integrity. All
patients underwent clinical tumor response assessment
before surgery with the same imaging modalities that
were used for the inclusion into the study.

Study Procedures
Treatment plan
The total dose of RT was 45 Gy delivered in 25
fractions of 1.8 Gy, 5 days/week. The clinical target
volume (CTV) included the tumor, with margins of
2–3 cm depending on tumor direction, mesorectum and
regional lymph nodes. The planning target volume was
defined as CTV + 1 cm margin.
Chemotherapy given during RT consisted of
three biweekly cycles of infusional oxaliplatin, 100

Pathology
Tumor regression grade (TRG) was blindly
measured according to the Mandard scale [36] by two
pathologists (GB and FT). In case of discrepancy between
the two the worse TRG score was assigned.
A complete pathologic response (ypCR,) was
defined as the absence of viable tumor cells in the primary
tumor and lymph nodes (ypT0N0). Radical resection (R0)
was defined as macroscopic and microscopic tumor-free
resection for both primary tumor (CRM > 1 mm) and
metastatic disease (margins > 1 mm from tumor).

We are grateful to Dr. Valeria Vicario and Dr.
Alessandra Trocino from the National Cancer Institute of
Naples for providing excellent bibliographic service and
assistance.

FUNDING
The study was a no-profit trial partially supported
by research grants from the Italian Ministry of Health to
A. Avallone (RF-2009-1539464) and to A. Budillon (RF2011-02346914). Bevacizumab was kindly provided by
Hoffmann-La Roche, Italy.

Adjuvant treatment and follow up
Four months of post-operative FOLFOX4 regimen,
no earlier than 4 weeks after surgery, was planned only
in patients with ypN+ or CRM ≤ 1 mm at pathology
examination, or for those with baseline metastatic disease
eventually resected with an R0/R1 status.
Clinical examination, CEA serum level, whole body
CT and pelvic MRI, were performed every 4 months for
the first 2 years of follow up, every 6 months for the next
3 years, and annually thereafter.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Antonio Avallone: honoraria from Roche for
participation in conferences as speaker and in advisory
board meetings. All other authors have declared no conflict
interest.

Statistical design and analysis
The primary end point of this study was the rate of
TRG1. To establish the sample size, the Simon’s two-stage
design was applied [37]. Setting α and β errors at 0.05 and
0.20, respectively, and defining as the minimum activity
of interest (p0) a TRG1 rate of 30%, in order to accept
the alternative hypothesis (p1) of a TRG1 rate ≥ 50%, at
least 6 TRG1 in the first 15 patients and at least 19 TRG1
among a total of 46 patients would need to be reported in
the first and second stage, respectively.
The study protocol provided that the sequential
schedule of bevacizumab would be evaluated only if
the required number of TRG1 was not reached with the
concomitant schedule. Other endpoints included toxicity,
surgical morbidity, and long-term outcome.
Toxicities, were graded according to the National
Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (NCI CTCVersion 3). Postoperative complications were included in
this report when occurring within 90 days from surgery.
Late toxicity was assessed using the SOMA-LENT scale
[38]. Proportions were calculated with their exact 95%
confidence interval (CI).
PFS was calculated from the date of initial treatment
until tumor progression or relapse, death for any cause or
last follow-up. OS was calculated from the date of initial
treatment to the date of death for any cause or last followup. PFS and OS rates were estimated with their 95% CI
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis was based on the
intention-to-treat, and was performed using SPSS statistical
analysis software (version 12.0; SPSS Inc.). No comparison
between the two cohorts of patients was planned. The end
point database was updated in December 2014.
