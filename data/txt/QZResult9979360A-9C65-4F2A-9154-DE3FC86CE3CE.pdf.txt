ABSTRACT
The Notch signaling pathway plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation.
Emerging data have revealed aberrant Notch3 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). However, whether Notch3 plays a role in tumorigenesis or tumor progression
is unclear. In this study, we found that over 71.8% of the cases studied had high
Notch3 expression levels (n = 32); Notch3 expression positively correlated with alphafetoprotein (AFP) levels (p = 0.0311) and negatively correlated with the differentiation
grade (p = 0.042). We demonstrated that the patients with higher levels of Notch3
expression commonly had a poor prognosis. We discovered that Notch3 expression
is inversely correlated with β-catenin content but positively associated with the
protein level of Nanog. In parallel, we found that Notch3 attenuation resulted in the
upregulation of β-catenin and the downregulation of Nanog in the hepatoma cell
lines QGY7701 and HepG2. The downregulation of Notch3 enhanced the sensitivity
to cisplatin in the QGY7701 and HepG2 cells and inhibited the ability of QGY7701
cells to form tumors. The Notch3-positive cells had higher levels of aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, and a tendency to differentiate into Notch3-negative
cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Notch3 plays a role in modulating
the stemness of tumor cells via the inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

including chemotherapeutic resistance, metastasis and
recurrence [2, 3]. Recent evidence suggests that the
presence and metastasis of CSCs results in unsatisfactory
chemotherapeutic outcomes and poor prognoses [4, 5].
The Notch pathway is a critical signaling pathway
that is associated with several physiological processes [6–8].
However, emerging evidence has demonstrated that abnormal
Notch signal transduction is implicated in tumorigenesis
and progression. The discovery of aberrant Notch gene
translocation in human pre-T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (T-ALL) was one of the first indications that the
Notch pathway is linked to human cancer pathogenesis
[9, 10]. Since then, many studies have demonstrated

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most
common cancer worldwide, and over fifty percent of
the cases are found in Asia [1]. More than 80% of HCC
patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, by which
time, the tumors cannot be surgically removed. However,
even when surgical resection is combined with the
chemotherapeutic management of HCC, this treatment can
still be unsatisfactory due to the recurrence and metastasis
of malignant cancer cells. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or
tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) are the initial cancer cells
that possess the properties of tumor progenitor cells,

dysfunctional Notch activity in numerous cancers [11, 12].
The Notch pathway plays a key physiological role in tissue
and cell development by regulating the expression of target
genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation [6, 13].
Many studies have proposed that Notch signaling is involved
in maintaining the stemness of CSCs. However, other
previous studies indicated that the Notch pathway functions
as a tumor suppressor in carcinogenesis [11, 14, 15].
Given the uncertainty of whether Notch activity has a
positive or negative effect on tumorigenesis and progression,
it is important to analyze the function of Notch in specific
cancer types and in both clinical and experimental settings.
Recently, several studies have proven that the Notch
pathway is involved in the progression of HCC, but the
mechanism of carcinogenesis underlying HCC initiation
is still obscure. Therefore, in this study, we assessed
whether the Notch pathway plays a role in the pathological
progression of HCC and formulated a hypothesis that Notch
participates in the regulation of the CSC population.

maintaining HCC progenitor cells. Furthermore, the
survival analysis indicated that Notch3 is a poor prognostic
marker in HCC (Figure 2D), which suggests that aberrant
Notch3 expression is involved in the progression of the
tumor. Based on the results above, it is likely that Notch3
participates in the regulation of the population of CSCs.

Notch3 activation negatively correlates with the
β-catenin signaling pathway
β-catenin is implicated in cell-cell adhesion as well
as gene transcription. Deregulated β-catenin has been
discovered in many types of tumors. The activation of
β-catenin promotes tumor proliferation. We questioned
whether Notch3 regulates the β-catenin signaling pathway.
We determined the Notch3 and β-catenin protein content in
the tumor specimens and found Notch3 protein accumulation
in the tumor tissues (Figure 3A, 3B); this accumulation was
inversely associated with the level of β-catenin (Figure 3C,
3D, 3E). These results suggest that Notch3 might inhibit
β-catenin accumulation to modulate tumor cell proliferation.
However, previous results have shown that Notch3
expression indicates a poor outcome according to survival
analyses. Therefore, we supposed that Notch3 might inhibit
β-catenin and result in maintaining the stemness of the tumor
cell. We thus detected several stemness-related proteins,
including Myc, Oct4 and Nanog. We found that Myc and
Oct4 were rarely expressed in the tumor samples. However, a
significant amount of Nanog expression was detected in these
specimens, which was consistent with the Notch3 expression
profile (Figure 3E, 3F). Nanog determines the capacity for
cellular self-renewal and proliferation. These data indicated
that Notch3 might inhibit β-catenin and increase Nanog to
modulate tumor cell differentiation and thereby regulate the
CSC population in the pathogenesis of HCC.

RESULTS
Notch3 expression is activated in HCC tumor
tissues
We assayed the expression profiles of the Notchrelated genes (Notch1–4, Jagged2, Hes1) in HCC and normal
liver tissues with Q-RT-PCR assays (Figure 1A–1F). The
Notch3 and Hes1 gene expression levels were significantly
increased in the tumor tissue compared with the normal liver
tissue from the same patient (Figure 1C, 1F). For 71.8% of all
the cases tested (n = 32), Notch3 mRNA levels in the tumor
were higher than those in the normal liver tissue. In addition,
the level of Hes1 gene expression was increased in tumor
tissues over that in normal liver tissues in more than 78.1%
of the cases (n = 32) (Figure 1G). This positive correlation
of Notch3 and Hes1 expression (R2 = 0.78, p < 0.001,
n = 32) suggests that higher expression levels of Notch3
in the tumor may result in an upregulation of Hes1 gene
expression (Figure 1H).

Notch3 plays a crucial role in HCC progression
by interacting with the β-catenin pathway and
regulating Nanog expression
We also screened the Notch3 protein expression
profiles in several hepatoma cell lines. Notch3 exhibited
higher expression levels in hepatoma cells compared with
the immortalized normal liver cell line HL7702 (Figure 4A).
Among the hepatoma cell lines, we found that QGY7701
cells highly express Notch3. Therefore, we silenced Notch3
mRNA expression by siRNA transfection in the QGY7701
cells. We designed 4 pairs of siRNAs for the depletion of
Notch3 mRNA, and pairs 1 and 4 were chosen because of
their excellent performance regarding Notch3 knockdown
(Figure 4B). β-catenin was upregulated and Nanog was
downregulated after the depletion of Notch3 via siRNA
interference in the QGY7701 and HepG2 cells (Figure 4C,
4D). We further established that Notch3 downregulation
negatively regulated β-catenin expression (Figure 4G)
and enhanced the activation of β-catenin mediated by

Notch3 expression reflects differentiation
properties and correlates with a poor prognosis
in HCC
To determine how Notch3 expression affected the
tumor properties, we analyzed the AFP concentration
and differentiation grade as a function of notch3 levels.
The AFP levels negatively correlated with the degree of
differentiation, which suggests that AFP is more highly
expressed in undifferentiated cells (Figure 2A). We also
found that Notch3 expression negatively correlated with
the degree of differentiation but positively correlated
with AFP concentration (Figure 2B, 2C). The similar
correlation of AFP and Notch3 with the differentiation
state implies that both AFP and Notch3 play roles in

in the QGY7701 cells, and we found that the Nanogpositive cell population was reduced after the Notch3
depletion (Figure 5A). Notch3-positive cells were sorted
via FACS, and we found that the Notch3-positive cells
gradually lose Notch3 expression after 7 days in culture
(Figure 5B). We asked whether Notch3-positive cells
definitely have stemness by measuring the level of ALDH
activity, which is a property of stem cells. We demonstrated
that the QGY7701 cells have a high level of ALDH activity,
but this activity was decreased with the knockdown of
Notch3 via the interference of a lenti-shRNA (Figure
5C, 5D). The chemosensitivity to cisplatin treatment was
assayed with an MTT assay when Notch3 was inhibited by
a siRNA in the HepG2 and QGY7701 cells (Figure 5E, 5F).

role in HCC progression. Hyperactive Notch3 could
inhibit the expression of β-catenin and the upregulation
of Nanog. β-catenin is a well-known oncogene present in
many cancers. The mutation of adenomatous polyposis
coli(APC) gene, a negative regulator of β-catenin, induces
β-catenin activation and the transcription of important
target proteins and usually results in cell proliferation
and differentiation [23, 24]. According to the expression
profiles of Notch3 and β-catenin, it appears that Notch3
plays a paradoxical role in the progression of tumors.
However, because Nanog expression is positively
correlated with Notch3, it is likely Notch3 functions as
a governor to balance tumor cell proliferation and the
maintenance of the CSC population by regulating the
β-catenin pathway.
We silenced the expression of Notch3 via a siRNA
and demonstrated that the downregulation of Notch3
acutely promoted β-catenin expression and enhanced the
sensitivity to cisplatin. The downregulation of Notch3 in
the QGY7701 cells resulted in the poor survival of tumor
cells. The Notch3-knockdown cells had reduced ALDH
activity, while the Notch3-positive cells, which were
sorted by FACS, were likely to lose Notch3 expression
and tended to become similar to the parental cells from
which they were selected. We confirmed in this study
that Notch3 is potentially a specific marker of HCC and
plays a role in the regulation of the CSCs in a hepatoma
by interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The
development of new drugs targeting Notch3 would induce
the specific inhibition of the CSC population and promote
the regression of HCC.

DISCUSSION
CSCs, also called T-ICs, are a highly heterogeneous
tumor progenitor cell population that in several carcinomas
is involved in the processes of disease progression, including
tumor initiation, invasion, metastasis, chemotherapeutic
resistance and tumor recurrence [16]. Recently, emerging
studies have focused on identifying and characterizing
the CSC properties that could be useful targets for tumor
prevention [17, 18]. The Notch signaling pathway is
a conserved signaling pathway that plays a role in the
development of the mammalian body by managing cell
fate decisions and proliferation [18]. Previous studies have
demonstrated that Notch signaling participates in CSC
self-renewal and the maintenance of cancer stemness, as
well as tumorigenesis [11, 12]. Our study attempted to
explain whether Notch plays a key role in the regulation of
hepatocellular CSCs.
Tumor specimens from HCC patients were collected
to measure Notch pathway-related genes with Q-RTPCR assays, which indicated that the levels of Notch3, a
Notch receptor family subtype, were increased in tumor
tissues. Hes1, a Notch pathway target gene [19, 20], was
also found to be upregulated in the HCC tumor tissues.
We confirmed that Notch3 gene expression was higher
in tumor tissues compared with normal liver tissues in
over 70% of all the HCC patients tested. Nearly 80% of
the HCC patients also exhibited higher expression levels
of Hes1 in the tumor tissues. These results indicate that
Notch3-induced Notch pathway activation is a significant
feature of HCC. Our results further confirmed that AFP, a
clinical diagnostic marker of HCC, negatively correlates
with the degree of differentiation, which was also the case
for Notch3 expression. In addition, Notch3 expression
positively correlated with the AFP levels. However,
Notch3 and AFP co-existed in only a subset of the tumor
cell population. Previous studies documented that AFPpositive tumor cells have some properties of HCC CSCs
[21, 22]. Therefore, we speculated that the Notch3-positive
cells are a subpopulation of CSCs. These results indicate
that Notch3 is expressed in cells that are maintaining in
differentiation state. Experienced clinicians frequently
find that tumors with higher growth activity seem to be
more susceptible to chemotherapeutic treatment. However,
HCC cells arrested in the Go phase maintain some CSC
properties, such as self-renewal, differentiation capability,
tumor recurrence and chemotherapeutic resistance. Thus,
Notch3 is likely a distinctive biomarker of CSCs that is
relevant to HCC progression.
In this study, we discovered that Notch3 expression
is aberrant and confirmed that Notch3 plays an essential

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical specimens
HCC patients participating in this study were
diagnosed by an oncologist, and HCC was confirmed by
a pathologist. This study was approved by the Medical
Ethics committee at the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong
Medical College (Ethics Committee protocol number:
PJ2013105). All the participants were informed of
how their tissue samples would be used and how the
experimental results might be presented. We ensured that
all the patients understood this information and signed the
written informed consent form. After surgical resection,
tumor and normal liver tissues (adjacent non-tumor tissue)
were collected immediately and frozen in liquid nitrogen
before use.

hepatoma cell line QGY7701 because of the increased
expression of Notch3 in these cells. An siRNANotch3 gene knockdown kit was purchased from JIMA
Biotechnology Company (Shanghai, China). There
were four pairs of oligos designed to target Notch3 in
this kit. First, we screened the efficacy of the Notch3
knockdown and selected two excellent pairs (1# and 4#)
for the following experiments. We used Lipfectamine
RNAiMAX (Lifetechnology, USA) to carry the siRNA
in and 20pmol siRNA were transfected to each 24well plate. This experiment was carried out according
the manufactory’s protocol. For stable knockdown of
Notch3, 4# siRNA and control si-RNA were respectively
constructed into a lenti-shRNA vector system and
stable-depleted Notch3 cells were obtained after 7days
puromycin selecting.
We used Lipofectamine 3000 reagent to transfect 20
pmol of siRNA for each 24-well plate. This experiment
was carried out according the manufacturer’s protocol
(Life Technology, USA).

Cell culture and treatment
Several hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Smmc7721,
HeP3B, QGY7701, QGY7703, MHCC97L, MHCC97H,
SK-HEP-1), one immortalized liver cell line (HL7702)
were used in this study. HepG2, Smmc7721, HeP3B,
QGY7701, QY7703, MHCC97L, MHCC97H and SKHEP-1 cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of
Shanghai (China). The HepG2 and Smmc7721 cells were
both cultured in RPMI 1640 basic medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, cat:10100–147, Gibco,
Australia). The Hep3B, QGY7701, QY7703, MHCC97L,
MHCC97H, and SK-HEP-1 cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS. The HL7702 cells were
kindly provided by Dr. Yi Cao (Laboratory of Molecular
and Experimental Pathology, Kunming Institute of
Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were collected and washed twice with PBS
and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room
temperature. The fixing solution was removed by
centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in 90%
methanol for permeabilization. The cells were washed
twice in washing buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS). The cells
were then resuspended in 100 μl of primary antibody
at a dilution of 1:100 in washing buffer and incubated
for 1 hr. After washing, the cells were resuspended in
an Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated secondary antibody at a
dilution of 1:200 in washing buffer for 30 min at room
temperature. After centrifugation, the cells were washed
once, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and analyzed with a
flow cytometer.

Western blot analysis
Protein samples were prepared with Fastprep-24
Sample Preparation equipment (MP, USA). Primary
antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology
and diluted 1:1,000 in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA).
Secondary antibodies were purchased from Earthox
(Cat: E030120–01) and used at a 1:3,000 dilution. The
membranes containing protein blots were incubated
in blocking buffer (5% non-fat milk) for 1 hr at room
temperature before the primary antibody addition.
TBS (tris buffered saline) supplemented with 0.5% Triton
X-100 (TBST) was used as the washing buffer.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

The antibodies used for the FACS analysis (APCconjugated Notch3 antibody: FAB6870A; Isotype
antibody: IC002A) were obtained from R&D Systems,
Inc. Cells were collected by adding 0.25% trypsin
supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA. Aliquots of cells
(1 × 106 cells/100 μl) were placed into FACS tubes, and
10 μl of the APC-conjugated antibody was added to each
tube; the tubes were then incubated for 30 minutes at
room temperature in the dark. The negative control was
incubated with the APC-conjugated isotype antibody.
Notch3-high A total of 3 tubes of cells were sorted into two
groups, Notch3-high and Notch3-low, which were cultured
for the following experiment. The two groups of Notch3positive cells were analyzed via flow cytometry at days 7
after sorting. The details of the FACS experiment can be
found in the protocol provided by R&D Systems, Inc on
the company’s web site.

Tissue specimens were dissected from the patients,
rinsed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to clear the
blood and fixed in 10% neutralized buffered formalin (NBF)
overnight. The tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut
into 4-μm-thick sections. Primary antibodies specific to
Notch3 and β-catenin were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology, and the secondary antibody was purchased
from Earthox (Cat: E030120–01). The sections were
processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining and IHC. The
detailed protocols for the IHC procedures were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology and were strictly followed.
