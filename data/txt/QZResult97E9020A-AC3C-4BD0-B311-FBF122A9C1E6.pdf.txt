Abstract
Progesterone, an agonist for the progesterone receptor (PR), can be an efﬁcacious and well-tolerated treatment
in endometrial cancer. The clinical use of progesterone is limited because of the lack of biomarkers that predict
hormone sensitivity. Despite its efﬁcacy in cancer therapy, mechanisms and site of action for progesterone remain
unknown. Using an in vivo endometrial cancer mouse model driven by clinically relevant genetic changes but
dichotomous responses to hormonal therapy, we show that signaling through stromal PR is necessary and
sufﬁcient for progesterone antitumor effects. Endometrial cancers resulting from epithelial loss of PTEN
(PTENKO) were hormone sensitive and had abundant expression of stromal PR. Stromal deletion of PR as a
single genetic change in these tumors induced progesterone resistance indicating that paracrine signaling
through the stroma is essential for the progesterone therapeutic effects. A hormone-refractory endometrial tumor
with low levels of stromal PR developed when activation of KRAS was coupled with PTEN-loss (PTENKO/Kras).
The innate progesterone resistance in PTENKO/Kras tumors stemmed from methylation of PR in the tumor
microenvironment. Add-back of stromal PR expressed from a constitutively active promoter sensitized these
tumors to progesterone therapy. Results show that signaling through stromal PR is sufﬁcient for inducing
hormone responsiveness. Our ﬁndings suggest that epigenetic derepression of stromal PR could be a potential
therapeutic target for sensitizing hormone-refractory endometrial tumors to progesterone therapy. On the basis
of these results, stromal expression of PR may emerge as a reliable biomarker in predicting response to hormonal
therapy. Cancer Res; 73(15); 4697–710. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Typically, antagonists of steroid receptors are exploited in
the therapy for hormonally regulated carcinomas (1–3). Endometrial cancer is unique in that agonistic actions of progesterone exert antitumor effects. Uterine cancers are the most
prevalent gynecologic malignancy in the western world with a
rising incidence in the United States (4). Most uterine tumors
arise from the endometrium, a hormonally regulated cell layer
composed of epithelium and stroma. Endometrioid carcino-

mas, characterized by crowded disorganized epithelial glands
with few intervening stroma, are the most common subtype of
these tumors (5). Some of these cancers originate from excess
proliferation induced by imbalances in estrogen and progesterone. Activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressors
initiates other tumors that are fueled by hormonal imbalances
(6). Although hormonal therapy is successfully used in treatment and chemoprevention of breast (1, 2) and prostate
adenocarcinomas (3), it is less widely embraced in therapy
for endometrial cancers.
In the normal endometrium, prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen can cause endometrial hyperplasia and cancer
(7–9). Administration of high-dose progesterone induces thinning of the normal endometrial lining (10). Given that progesterone causes atrophy of the normal endometrium, it is administered clinically as a single agent in the therapy for endometrial
cancer. Despite ﬁve decades of clinical use, the antitumor
mechanisms and site of action for progesterone therapy remain
unknown. Molecular mechanisms underlying progesterone
resistance or sensitivity are also poorly understood.
Progesterone is well tolerated, easily administered, and has
minimal side effects. Subsets of patients respond to progesterone, whereas others have progression of disease while on
hormonal therapy (11). Response rates to progesterone range
from 11% to 50% in primary and recurrent disease (12).

Despite its efﬁcacy, hormonal therapy is not commonly
administered in treatment of endometrial cancer primarily
because patients with hormone-sensitive or -resistant disease
cannot be prospectively identiﬁed. Standard therapy for
endometrial cancer involves removal of reproductive organs,
at times coupled with adjuvant radio- or chemotherapy (13).
Although this approach may be curative, it causes loss of
fertility and can induce life-long side effects. Patients with
metastatic disease often succumb to the cancer despite
aggressive treatments (14). Discovery of reliable biomarkers
that predict responsiveness to progesterone therapy and
molecular mechanisms that dictate hormone sensitivity or
resistance could broaden the application of hormonal therapy to patients with endometrial cancer.
A challenge in endometrial cancer research is the perception of the endometrium as a homogeneous tissue. The
endometrium is composed of epithelium and stroma, two
distinct cell types with unique functions and responsiveness
to steroid hormones (15, 16). To study contributions of each
cell type in tumor initiation and progression, we established
an in vivo endometrial regeneration model from dissociated
epithelial and stromal populations (17). This model provides
a unique tool for induction of concomitant but separate
genetic changes in these two compartments (17) an experimental approach not achievable with existing endometrial
cancer models. Here, we used our dual compartment regeneration system as an in vivo preclinical platform for testing
responsiveness to hormonal therapy in endometrial tumors
generated from clinically relevant genetic changes. Tumors
resulting from epithelial loss of PTEN were exquisitely
progesterone sensitive, whereas tumors resulting from activation of KRAS concomitant with PTEN-loss were completely progesterone resistant. Using these endometrial cancer
models with dichotomous responses to hormonal therapy,
we show that signaling through stromal progesterone receptor (Pgr or PR) is necessary and sufﬁcient for antitumor
effects of progesterone therapy.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6, PtenloxP/loxP (C;129S4-Ptentm1Hwu/J),
KrasLSL-G12D/þ (B6.129S4-Krastm4Tyj/J) and CB17Scid/Scid
mice were from The Jackson Laboratory. PRloxP/loxP (PRCE) mice
were from Dr. Luisa Iruela-Arispe (University of California, Los
Angeles, Los Angeles, CA). PtenloxP/loxP KrasLSL-G12D/þ mice
were generated by crossing the KrasLSL-G12D allele into the
PtenloxP/loxP background. Mice were maintained in accordance
with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA; Los Angeles,
CA), Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine (DLAM) guidelines. All animal experiments were approved by the UCLA
Animal Research Committee.
Lentivirus constructs and preparation
The Cre-RFP (17), Cre-GFP (18), and GFP (19) lentiviral
constructs have been previously described. Generation of
the hPR-GFP and inducible Cre-shPTEN-GFP constructs is
outlined in Supplementary Methods. Lentivirus production,

titering, and infection of cells were conducted as previously
described (20).
Preparation of endometrial stroma and epithelia
Mouse neonatal uterine stroma and adult endometrial
epithelial were prepared as previously described (17). Endometrial epithelial were isolated to purity by ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) sorting as reported previously
(21). To obtain adult endometrial epithelia, mouse uteri were
dissected, cut into fragments, and incubated in 1% trypsin for
45 minutes at 4 C. Luminal epithelia were separated from
underlying stroma with a ﬁne forceps and digested with 0.8
mg/mL collagenase in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM)/10% FBS with 5 mg/mL insulin and 0.5 mg/mL DNase
for 1.5 hours at 37 C. Digested fractions were passed through
22-gauge syringes and ﬁltered through 40-mm cell strainers to
yield single-cell suspensions. Cells were stained on ice with
shaking for 15 minutes for FACS. Endometrial epithelia marked
by Trop1þCD90CD45CD31Ter119 were FACS isolated
using a BD FACSAria II ﬂow cytometer. Antibodies used for
FACS are listed in Supplementary Tables.
Tumor generation
Endometrial tumor generation was conducted as previously
described (17). In some experiments endometrial epithelium or
stroma were infected with lentivirus as described in Supplementary Methods. For all experiments, approximately 125,000
prepared epithelial and 200,000 stromal cells were mixed,
resuspended in collagen (BD Biosciences; 354236), and dispensed into grafts. Endometrial grafts were implanted under
the kidney capsule of oophorectomized CB17Scid/Scid mice
and regenerated for 6 to 8 weeks with an estrogen pellet (60-day
time release, 0.72-mg b-estradiol/pellet; SE-121 Innovative
Research of America). Tumors generated with 100% efﬁciency
using this 1:1 to 1:2 epithelial to stromal cell ratio.
Hormone therapy
An 8-week course of progesterone therapy was administered
by subcutaneous implantation of a time release pellet (60-day
time release, 100 mg progesterone/pellet; SP-131 Innovative
Research of America). Placebo treatment in control mice was
achieved by implantation of placebo pellets (60-day time
release, 100 mg progesterone placebo/pellet; SC-111 Innovative Research of America). Estrogen pellets (60-day time
release, 0.72-mg b-estradiol/pellet; SE-121 Innovative Research
of America) were replenished at the start of progesterone
therapy, unless otherwise noted. All surgical procedures were
carried out under the UCLA DLAM regulations. Serum hormone levels in mice were veriﬁed using estradiol EIA and
progesterone EIA kits (Cayman Chemical).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was conducted as previously
described (17) using antibodies listed in Supplementary Tables.
To quantify expression of Ki67, terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and
cleaved caspase-3, 5 to 10 high-power ﬁelds of view were scored
per sample and averaged.

Progesterone Antitumor Effects Are Mediated by Tumor Stroma

Isolation of epithelia and stroma from regenerated
tumors
PTENKO or PTENKO/Kras color-marked tumors were
minced and digested in 1 mg/mL each of collagenase and
dispase in DMEM/10% FBS with 5 mg/mL insulin and 0.5
mg/mL DNase for 2 hours at 37 C. Resulting cells were passed
through a 22-gauge syringe to yield a single-cell suspension that
was visualized and sorted using the BD FACSAria II.
Quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted as previously
described (21). RNA for qPCR was extracted from isolated
tumor cell fractions using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit
(Qiagen). Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene
Gapdh. Primers are outlined in Supplementary Tables.
Western blot analysis
Western blotting of isolated cell fractions was conducted as
previously described (21) using antibodies outlined in Supplementary Tables.
Methylation-speciﬁc PCR and bisulﬁte sequencing
DNA extracted from isolated tumor cell fractions was analyzed by methylation-speciﬁc PCR and bisulfate sequencing
using previously reported protocols (22) with minor modiﬁcations. Detailed descriptions and a list of the primers used are
presented in Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean  SD. To determine significance, comparisons were conducted using a two-tailed t test
for groups of two- or one-way ANOVA with Tukey honestly
signiﬁcant difference test for three or more groups.

Results
Progesterone therapy effectively treated endometrial
tumors resulting from cell autonomous loss of PTEN
Mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene are reported
in up to 79% of endometrioid endometrial cancers (23) where
PTEN expression is lost predominantly in the tumor epithelium (24). Given the prevalence of this genetic change, deﬁning
whether PTEN status is a biomarker of response to hormonal
therapy could be a valuable clinical tool. Results of retrospective clinical studies on this subject vary widely, with some
studies reporting PTEN-loss as a positive predictor (25, 26),
whereas others report loss of PTEN as a negative predictor
of response to progesterone (27, 28). A problem in these studies
is that tumors examined may contain other genetic alterations in addition to PTEN-loss. We hypothesized that tumors
resulting from epithelial loss of PTEN, as a single genetic
change, would be sensitive to hormonal therapy.
To address this hypothesis, the effects of progesterone
therapy on PTEN-null tumors were examined using an in vivo
model system (Fig. 1A). This model (17) mimics epithelialspeciﬁc loss of PTEN seen in human endometrial cancers (24)
unlike existing eutopic mouse models where Pten is deleted in
both the epithelium and stroma (29–31). Endometrial epithelia

were FACS isolated from uteri of PtenloxP/loxP mice and infected
with lentivirus expressing red ﬂuorescent protein (RFP) and
Cre recombinase (17), resulting in deletion of Pten (Fig. 1A).
These epithelia were combined with WT stroma and regenerated in the subrenal space of oophorectomized mice supplemented with estrogen via implantation of an 8-week timerelease 17b-estradiol pellet (Fig. 1A; ref. 17). At 8 weeks, one
mouse was sacriﬁced to conﬁrm establishment of PTEN-null
endometrioid endometrial tumors (PTENKO) that had a high
proliferation index (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). Given
that endometrial cancer commonly occurs in patients with
high estrogen levels (32), tumor-bearing mice were reimplanted
with new estradiol pellets to maintain a hyper-estrogenic state.
Simultaneously, half of these mice were implanted with progesterone pellets, whereas the other half were treated with
placebo for 8 weeks (Fig. 1A). Measurement of serum hormone
levels conﬁrmed high circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone in progesterone-treated mice but only high levels of
estrogen in the placebo group (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Large
tumors were attached to the kidneys of placebo-treated mice
(Fig. 1B, a and b), whereas only small cysts were found on
kidneys of progesterone-treated animals (Fig. 1B, c and d). The
histology of placebo-treated PTENKO tumors was endometrioid with epithelial-speciﬁc loss of PTEN (Fig. 1C, a and b
and Supplementary Fig. S1D). Progesterone-treated PTENKO
endometrial tumors resolved and remaining tissue was primarily a simple cyst lined with normal appearing PTEN-null
epithelium (Fig. 1C, e and f and Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Abundant expression of epithelial and stromal estrogen receptor-a (Esr1 or ER-a), and PR was detected in both progesterone- and placebo-treated tissue (Fig. 1C, c, d, g, and h).
Progesterone therapy signiﬁcantly diminished proliferation of
PTEN-null epithelium as measured by Ki67 (Mki67) expression
(Fig. 1D).
Our ﬁndings show that endometrial tumors resulting from
epithelial loss of PTEN are exquisitely sensitive to progesterone
hormonal therapy. Observations in this mouse model suggest
that loss of Pten as a single genetic change in the tumor
epithelia should be investigated as a potential biomarker of
response to progesterone therapy in patients with endometrial
cancer.
Hormone-mediated resolution of PTEN-null
endometrial tumors is time-dependent but occurs
efﬁciently in a short period
The time required for resolution of endometrial cancers
treated with progesterone therapy varies widely (33). In some
patients, tumors resolve within a few weeks of therapy, whereas others require more than 6 months of progesterone administration to show a clinical response (33). Many factors could
contribute to this variation: dose and mode of drug administration, genetic heterogeneity in endometrial cancers, and
variations in the patient's endogenous hormonal milieu. An
advantage in our model is the homogenous genetic background of tumors and the host mice bearing tumors. Also, we
are able to pharmacologically control the experimental hormonal milieu. This model enables us to systematically investigate the response of PTENKO tumors to hormonal therapy.

Effective tumor therapy requires a shift in the balance
between cellular proliferation and cell death. We observed a
biphasic response to progesterone in this kinetic experiment.
In the ﬁrst therapeutic phase cell proliferation ceased, whereas
in the second phase cell death ensued, resulting in resolution of
the remaining tumor cells. Findings here show that progesterone antitumor effects in PTENKO tumors are quick but
kinetic resulting from a combination of decreased proliferation
and increased cell death.

estrogen pellets were removed but new estrogen and progesterone pellets were implanted (estrogen and progesterone
cotherapy; Fig. 3A). Before initiating treatment, establishment
of pretherapy tumors was conﬁrmed (Fig. 3B, a–c). Cotherapy
with estrogen and progesterone resolved PTENKO endometrial
tumors shown by development of cysts (Fig. 3B, e–g) with
decreased epithelial proliferation compared with pretherapy

state resulting from a variety of causes (32). Thus far, we
administered continuous estrogen during progesterone therapy
to mimic a hyper-estrogenic state. Estrogen alone promotes
progression of endometrial cancer; therefore, in clinical practice
progesterone is administered without estrogen. To replicate
standard practice, we tested the efﬁcacy of progesterone without estrogen in therapy for PTENKO tumors.
Mice bearing PTENKO tumors were divided into two cohorts

tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Surprisingly, PTENKO
tumors treated with progesterone alone persisted (Fig. 3B,
i–k) and had a proliferation index comparable with pretherapy
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3A). ER-a was expressed in the
epithelia and stroma of all PTENKO tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Notably, PTENKO tumors treated with progesterone
alone had signiﬁcantly diminished stromal PR (Fig. 3C, c)
compared with estrogen and progesterone cotreated (Fig.
3C, b) and pretherapy counterparts (Fig. 3C, a). Abundant
expression of epithelial PR was detected in all conditions (Fig.
3B (d, h, and l) and C).
Findings here show that coadministration of estrogen with
progesterone is required in hormonal therapy for PTENKO
tumors. Although in clinical practice progesterone is administered without estrogen, in fact many patients with endometrial
carcinomas are often obese and have elevated levels of endogenous estrogen due to the activity of aromatase in adipocytes
(32, 34). Thus, in many patients progesterone is acting in a high
estrogenic hormonal milieu similar to that used in our experiments. Differences in the hormonal milieu of patients with
endometrial cancer may account for the wide variation in time
required to achieve therapeutic responses (33).
Stromal deletion of PR is sufﬁcient to convert a
hormone-sensitive tumor to a hormone-refractory
cancer
Despite its efﬁcacy, the mechanisms of progesterone action
and signaling in endometrial tumors have not been systematically investigated. Progesterone is the agonist for the PR (35).
PR is expressed in the normal endometrial epithelium and
stroma. With progression to cancer, expression of PR can
become deregulated and lost in either cellular compartment
(36). Given that PR is the primary target for progesterone, its
expression has been examined as a predictor of response to
hormonal therapy in endometrial cancer. In most studies,
expression of PR correlated with better response to hormonal
therapy, but some PR-negative tumors also respond to progesterone (37, 38). A problem in these studies is that PR was
examined in tumor lysates or histologic sections without
carefully assessing its epithelial and stromal expression (37,
38). It is unclear whether epithelial or stromal PR signaling
mediates effects of progesterone therapy. We observed that
PTENKO tumors became progesterone resistant with diminution of stromal PR (Fig. 3B (l) and C (c)). We hypothesized that
progesterone therapeutic effects in endometrial cancer are
mediated through PR signaling in the stroma of the tumor
microenvironment.
To address this question, PR was selectively deleted in the
stroma of PTENKO endometrial tumors. Neonatal PRloxP/loxP
(39) endometrial stromal cells were infected with Cre-expressing or control lentivirus marked with GFP and cultured for
short term (Fig. 4A). Expression of Cre in these cells resulted in
loss of PR-A and PR-B (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Combinations
of FACS-isolated PR-deleted (Cre-GFP) or PR WT (GFP) stroma
with PTENKO epithelia were implanted in mice supplemented
with estrogen throughout the course of this experiment
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4B). After tumors were

(Fig. 4A). In tumors with stroma expressing WT PR (GFP
infected stroma), resolution of tumor was detected after
progesterone treatment (Fig. 4B, a and b), whereas tumors
persisted in placebo-treated controls (Fig. 4B, d and e). A
signiﬁcant drop in proliferation index was noted concomitant
with tumor resolution with progesterone therapy (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Abundant expression of stromal PR was detected
in this cohort (Fig. 4B, c and f). When PR was deleted in the
stroma of PTENKO tumors (Cre-GFP–infected stroma), progesterone-treated tumors persisted and resembled placebotreated counterparts (Fig. 4B, g and h vs. j and k). The
proliferation index of epithelia in progesterone- and placebo-treated PTENKO PR-deleted tumors was equivalent (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Loss of PR in the stroma of these tumors
was conﬁrmed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4B, i and l). Our
results show that one genetic change, deletion of stromal PR,
was sufﬁcient to convert hormone-sensitive PTENKO tumors
to hormone-refractory endometrial cancers (Fig. 4B). Conversely, epithelial-speciﬁc deletion of PR in PTENKO tumors
did not impact their response to progesterone therapy (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
These results show that signaling through stromal PR is
essential for mediating antitumor effects of hormonal therapy
in endometrial cancer. In developmental tissue recombination
studies, stromal PR signaling decreased estrogen-mediated
DNA synthesis in endometrial epithelia (40). During pregnancy,
signaling through stromal PR inhibits endometrial epithelial
proliferation to support fetal implantation (41). Our results
show that signaling through stromal PR decreases epithelial
tumor proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death in endometrial tumor tissue. We suspect that mediators of the antitumor effects of progesterone signaling from stroma are
paracrine-secreted growth factors.
Endometrial tumors driven by concomitant loss of PTEN
and Kras activation are refractory to progesterone
therapy
Epithelial Pten loss as a single genetic change was a positive
predictor of response to hormonal therapy in our model.
Activation of KRAS is a common mutation coexisting with
PTEN-loss in 21% of endometrial cancers (23). We asked if the
addition of KRAS activation to PTENKO tumors would alter the
susceptibility of resulting endometrial cancers to hormonal
therapy.
Endometrial epithelia from PtenloxP/loxPKrasLSL-G12D/þ mice
were infected with Cre-RFP resulting in loss of PTEN with
activation of KRAS (PTENKO/Kras; Fig. 5A). These cells were
combined with WT stroma and placed in the in vivo regeneration model (Fig. 5A). Within 6 weeks, combinations of
PTENKO/Kras epithelium and WT stroma gave rise to endometrioid endometrial tumors that invaded into the renal
parenchyma (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Mice harboring endometrial tumors were treated with progesterone or
placebo (Fig. 5A). Unlike progesterone-sensitive PTENKO
tumors, no response to hormonal therapy was observed in
PTENKO/Kras tumors (Fig. 5B vs. Fig. 1B). These tumors
persisted on the kidney, did not resolve despite coadministration of progesterone and estrogen and appeared similar to

endometrial cancer as potential biomarkers for assessing
response to progesterone therapy.

Our data show that stromal PR signaling is essential in

tumors (Fig. 4). Activation of KRAS in conjunction with
PTEN-loss resulted in hormone-refractory cancers containing predominantly PR-negative stroma (Fig. 5C, g and h). We
hypothesized that stromal PR protein levels would be
decreased in PTENKO/Kras tumors as a result of epigenetic
modiﬁcation.
PR expression in the epithelium and stroma of PTENKO
and PTENKO/Kras tumors was examined. On the basis of
immunohistochemistry, much lower levels of PR were
detected in the stroma but not epithelia of PTENKO/
Kras compared with PTENKO tumors (Fig. 6A). Next, differences in epithelial and stromal PR protein and transcript
were quantiﬁed in these carcinomas. Tumor stroma was

Figure 6. Stromal PR is diminished in PTENKO/Kras progesterone-resistant tumors by methylation. A, abundant PR was detected in the epithelium
and stroma of PTENKO tumors (a). Diminution in stromal PR was detected in PTENKO/Kras tumors (b). B, Western blot analysis conﬁrmed a decrease in
stromal PR of PTENKO/Kras tumors. Extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) was a loading control. C, qPCR revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in
PR-Aþ PR-B transcript in tumor stroma of PTENKO/Kras compared with PTENKO tumors (a). A nonsigniﬁcant decrease in levels of PR-B transcript was
detected (b). D, schematic of the PR-A promoter with CpG islands is shown. On the basis of bisulﬁte sequencing, a higher percentage of the PR-A promoter
CpG islands was methylated in tumor stroma of PTENKO/Kras compared with PTENKO tumors. Three independent tumors for each group were analyzed.
Scale bars, 50 mm.

A potential mechanism for regulation of PR expression is
epigenetic and through DNA methylation (42). Methylation of
the PR gene (Pgr) has been reported in human endometrial
cancer but was not speciﬁcally examined in stromal or epithelial
compartments (43). Given these previous ﬁndings, we ﬁrst
examined PR transcript levels in the stroma of PTENKO/Kras
compared with PTENKO tumors. There are two PR isoforms,

4706

PR-A and PR-B (44). PR-A is the dominant form of PR in the
endometrium (45). Both transcripts overlap such that all
nucleotides in PR-A are shared with PR-B (Supplementary Fig.
S6C; ref. 44), consequently PR-A transcripts cannot be measured directly. Message levels of PR-AþPR-B or PR-B alone were
determined in stroma and epithelia isolated from progesteronesensitive and -refractory tumors (Fig. 6C and Supplementary

Fig. S6C). Decreased transcript levels of PR-AþPR-B were
detected in stroma but not the epithelium of PTENKO/Kras
tumors compared with their hormone-sensitive PTENKO counterparts (Fig. 6C, a and Supplementary Fig. S6C). Decreased PRB transcript levels were also observed in PTENKO/Kras tumor
stroma, but this was not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 6C, b).
Results suggest that transcriptional modulation of PR primarily
occurred through repression of PR-A. Methylation-speciﬁc PCR
was conducted to examine DNA methylation in the PR-A
promoter (Supplementary Fig. S6D). A greater proportion of
methylated PR-A DNA was detected in the stroma of PTENKO/
Kras tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6E). Bisulﬁte sequencing
conﬁrmed methylation of DNA at the PR-A promoter. Minimal
methylation of the PR-A promoter was detected in PTENKO
tumor stroma, whereas the majority of PR-A promoter CpG
islands were methylated in the stroma of PTENKO/Kras tumors
(Fig. 6D). These ﬁndings conﬁrm that DNA methylation of PR-A
decreases transcription and thus expression of PR in the stroma
of progesterone refractory PTENKO/Kras tumors.
In this model, activation of KRAS with PTEN-loss in tumor
epithelium may lead to the secretion of paracrine factors that
modulate the epigenetic landscape of surrounding tumor
stroma. This signaling cascade from epithelium to stroma
could trigger a series of events ultimately resulting in methylation of the PR gene. Methylation of PR in hormone-refractory endometrial tumors may be among one of the mechanisms causing repression of PR transcription and expression in
tumor stroma.
Overexpression of exogenous PR in tumor stroma
sensitized PTENKO/Kras tumors to hormonal therapy
Progesterone-resistant PTENKO/Kras tumors had decreased
expression of stromal PR due to silencing of the PR gene in the
tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that loss of stromal
PR is a key mechanism leading to hormone resistance in
endometrial tumors. If this hypothesis is correct, reexpression
of PR in the tumor stroma would be sufﬁcient to sensitize
PTENKO/Kras tumors to hormonal therapy.
To address this question, the human PR (hPR) was cloned
into a GFP-expressing lentiviral vector (Supplementary Fig.
S7Aa). WT neonatal stroma was infected with hPR-GFP or GFP
control lentivirus (Fig. 7A). Overexpression of PR-A and PR-B
was conﬁrmed (Supplementary Fig. S7Ab and S7Ac). Stroma
expressing GFP or hPR-GFP was FACS isolated, combined
with Cre-RFP–infected PtenloxP/loxPKrasLSL-G12D/þ epithelia
and regenerated in vivo (Fig. 7A). This resulted in activation
of KRAS and PTEN-loss in tumor epithelium with or without
overexpression of human PR in the stroma. After 6 weeks,
tumor histology was similar in pretherapy PTENKO/Kras cancers regardless of PR overexpression in the stroma (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Mice were treated with estrogen plus
progesterone cotherapy (progesterone) or estrogen plus placebo (placebo; Fig. 7A). Tumors with WT GFP stroma were
large and persisted in both progesterone- and placebo-treated
cohorts (Fig. 7B, a and b vs. d and e). Stromal PR was significantly diminished in these tumors (Fig. 7B, c and f). In contrast,
when exogenous hPR was expressed in tumor stroma the
majority of PTENKO/Kras tumor tissue resolved with proges-

terone administration (Fig. 7B, g and h and Supplementary Fig.
S7Da and S7Db). This effect was mediated by progesterone
signaling as placebo-treated tumors expressing stromal hPR
persisted (Fig. 7B, j and k and Supplementary Fig. S7Dc and
S7Dd). Unlike PTENKO/Kras with WT-GFP stroma, tumors
with hPR-GFP stroma had abundant expression of PR in the
tumor microenvironment (Fig. 7B, c and f vs. i and l). Deletion of
PTEN and RAS pathway activation was conﬁrmed in tumor
epithelia (Supplementary Fig. S7C).
In PTENKO tumors, we showed that expression of stromal
PR was essential for progesterone-mediated resolution of the
carcinoma (Fig. 4). Here, we show that reexpression of PR in the
tumor stroma is sufﬁcient to sensitize the hormone-refractory
PTENKO/Kras endometrial tumors to progesterone therapy
(Fig. 7). Collectively, our ﬁndings show that signaling through
stromal PR is sufﬁcient and necessary for mediating antitumor
effects of progesterone therapy in endometrial cancer.

Discussion
The prevailing dogma in clinical practice assumes that
progesterone exerts its therapeutic effects through tumor
epithelia, which are the more abundant cell type in endometrial carcinomas. Studies have attempted to assess PR expression as a predicative biomarker for response to progesterone
therapy with limited success (37, 38). Here, we show that
progesterone hormonal therapy works by paracrine signaling
through PR in the endometrial tumor microenvironment. Loss
of stromal PR in PTENKO hormone-sensitive tumors induced
progesterone resistance. Activation of KRAS concomitant with
PTEN-loss initiated progesterone-resistant endometrial
tumors that had measurable loss of stromal PR. Add-back of
exogenous PR in the stroma of hormone-refractory tumors was
sufﬁcient to induce sensitivity to progesterone therapy. For the
ﬁrst time, we show that signaling through the stromal PR axis is
sufﬁcient and necessary for successful resolution of endometrial tumors with progesterone.
Cross-talk between epithelium and stroma is essential for
neoplastic transformation in many hormonally regulated tissues (18, 20, 46, 47). One way this cross-talk occurs is through
reciprocal signals regulating hormone receptor expression or
activity in each cellular compartment. Previously, we showed
that cancer-initiating ﬁbroblast growth factor signals originating from stroma increased androgen receptor levels in prostate
tumor epithelia, resulting in androgen-independent growth
(20). Here, we show that oncogenic insults in endometrial
tumor epithelia decreased levels of PR in tumor stroma inducing de novo progesterone resistance. Epigenetic modiﬁcation of
the tumor microenvironment has emerged as a potential
regulator of tumor initiation and propagation in breast (48)
and prostate (18) cancers. Our results show that epigenetic
regulation of tumor stroma can induce drug resistance. Deﬁning mechanisms and site of origin for innate or acquired
resistance to hormonal therapy in human endometrial cancer
trials will have immense translational application.
We ﬁnd that endometrial tumors resulting solely from
epithelial PTEN-loss are highly sensitive to progesterone antitumor effects. These results contradict ﬁndings from a Ptenþ/

in our study, estrogen is coadministered with progesterone
resulting in successful hormonal therapy for PTEN-null
tumors. The discrepancy in progesterone sensitivity in these
two models could be explained by stromal Pten status and the
absence or presence of estrogen during treatment.
Although loss of PTEN function is the most common genetic
change in endometrial cancer, in 21% of cases it occurs in
conjunction with KRAS activation (23). Despite the prevalence
of this coexisting genetic alteration, previous studies have not
assessed the sensitivity of endometrial tumors resulting from
PTEN-loss and KRAS activation to hormonal therapy. When
epithelial activation of KRAS was coupled with PTEN-loss,
stromal PR expression was drastically reduced resulting in
progesterone resistance. In another Pten/Kras transgenic
endometrial cancer model (30), decreased expression of PR
was reported. However, this study did not assess sensitivity of
these tumors to progesterone or examine PR distribution in
tumor epithelium or stroma. The lack of response to progesterone therapy in PTENKO/Kras tumors in our model may
explain why many PTEN-null endometrial cancers in clinical
series are refractory to progesterone therapy (27, 28). Coexistence of other genetic changes, such as activation of KRAS, in
these tumors may induce progesterone resistance. In a mouse
pancreatic tumor model, epithelial-speciﬁc activation of KRAS
could alter the tumor microenvironment by non–cell autonomous mechanisms (49). Similarly, we suspect that activation
of KRAS in PTEN-null tumor epithelia results in secretion of
paracrine factors that can modulate the endometrial tumor
microenvironment ultimately silencing PR expression.
This study reveals three imminently testable biomarkers for
progesterone sensitivity to be assessed in future clinical trials.
These biomarkers include PTEN and KRAS status in the tumor
epithelia and expression of PR in tumor stroma. Molecular
analysis of tumors with reliable biomarkers of response to
hormonal therapy can individualize treatment options for the
49,000 U.S. women diagnosed with endometrial cancer annu-

ally (4). Stromal loss of PR through epigenetic silencing was a
key mechanism inducing progesterone resistance in our model. Importantly, stromal reexpression of PR in hormone-refractory cancers sensitized these tumors to progesterone therapeutic effects. This ﬁnding may have critical clinical implications as it shows that modulation of the tumor microenvironment can reverse hormone resistance in endometrial tumors.
In future work, we will test if stromal-speciﬁc delivery of DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors may be an effective way to resensitize hormone-refractory endometrial cancers to progesterone therapy.
