activated or inhibited through oxidation of thiols, hemes, Fe-S
clusters, or other non-heme iron prosthetic groups of macromolecules (4, 5). The apparent outcome of NO signaling is
dependent on the level of NO production, which is dictated by
the isoforms of NO synthase (NOS)/endothelial (eNOS), neuronal
(nNOS), or inducible (iNOS) NO synthases (6). Physiologic, low
(nanomolar, nmol/L) concentrations of NO have been shown to
increase tumorigenesis (7–9), whereas pathophysiologic high
(micromolar, Amol/L) concentrations of NO, as produced by
activated macrophages, induce tumoricidal effects (10). We have
found that micromolar concentrations of NO, partially dependent
on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1)
induction, can either induce prolonged cytostasis or cytostasis
followed by apoptosis in a number of human breast cancer cell
lines. We have previously reported that micromolar concentrations
of NO up-regulates MKP-1 and induces apoptosis in breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-468 by mitochondria-regulated pathway (11).
In another study using the MDA-MB-231 cell line, we observed
that NO (micromolar concentrations) was unable to up-regulate
MKP-1, and apoptosis was not induced; however, cells underwent
prolonged cytostasis by down-regulating cyclin D1 protein and
hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (11, 12).
Recent studies have implicated low physiologic concentrations
of NO (nmol/L) in regulating different processes of tumorigenesis.
Clinical and experimental studies support a positive relationship
between tumor malignancy and NOS activity in certain tumors
(13–15). Solid tumors have been found to produce sustained levels
of NO, which is produced by tumor cells themselves or macrophages that infiltrate these tumors (16). NO production is
stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a strong
angiogenic factor that is up-regulated in tumor tissues (17).
Cytokines and chemokines in tumor microenvironment may
provide appropriate signals for recruitment and activation of
macrophages that are capable of NO production (18). Although NO
is an important component of tumor microenvironment, its role in
tumor biology remains to be elucidated. Detailed investigation is
required to understand cellular targets of NO, which could facilitate
elucidation of signaling pathways involved in tumor growth,
invasion, and metastasis. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases
(ERK1/2), which play a vital role in VEGF induced endothelial cell
proliferation, is the most well studied downstream target of NO
(19). The purpose of this study was to determine the key signaling
cascades targeted by physiologic (nanomolar) concentrations of
NO in malignant breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231
and MCF-7, which could give us an insight into the possible
mechanisms by which NO increases proliferation of tumor cells.

Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) in nanomolar (nmol/L) concentrations is
consistently detected in tumor microenvironment and has
been found to promote tumorigenesis. The mechanism by
which NO enhances tumor progression is largely unknown. In
this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms and
identified cellular targets by which NO increases proliferation
of human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7.
DETA-NONOate, a long acting NO donor, with a half-life of
20 h, was used. We found that NO (nmol/L) dramatically
increased total protein synthesis in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
and also increased cell proliferation. NO specifically increased
the translation of cyclin D1 and ornithine decarboxylase
(ODC) without altering their mRNA levels or half-lives. Critical
components in the translational machinery, such as phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its
downstream targets, phosphorylated eukaryotic translation
initiation factor and p70 S6 kinase, were up-regulated
following NO treatment, and inhibition of mTOR with
rapamycin attenuated NO induced increase of cyclin D1 and
ODC. Activation of translational machinery was mediated by
NO-induced up-regulation of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase/ERK
(Raf/MEK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase)/Akt signaling pathways. Up-regulation of the Raf/MEK/
ERK and PI-3 kinase/Akt pathways by NO was found to be
mediated by activation of Ras, which was cyclic guanosine
3¶,5¶-monophosphate independent. Furthermore, inactivation
of Ras by farnesyl transferase inhibitor or K-Ras small
interfering RNA attenuated NO-induced increase in proliferation signaling and cyclin D1 and ODC translation, further
confirming the involvement of Ras activation during NOinduced cell proliferation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):289–99]

Measurement of rate of NO release by DETA-NONOate. The rate of
NO released from 10 to 0 Amol/L DETA-NONOate in DMEM was assessed
over time using Sievers chemiluminescent NO analyzer (21).
Measurement of total protein synthesis. Cells (2  106) were plated
overnight in media containing DMEM and 5% FBS. The cells were kept
starved for 3 h in methionine/cysteine–free media (Life Technologies), after
which they were labeled for further 3 h with 100 ACi/mL of a mixture of
[35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. After removal of the radioactive media,
the cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, and lysed on ice for 30 min
in 1 mL of lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100] containing
0.2 mmol/L PMSF, 1 Amol/L pepstatin A, and 1 Amol/L leupeptin. Cell
lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 2,200  g for 5 min, and the protein
concentrations of the supernatant were determined using Protein Assay
Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA). Equal
amounts of lysates were spotted on Whatman No. 3MM and washed with
TCA, and incorporation of labeled [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine in protein
was measured in a scintillation counter.
Cell viability. Cells seeded in six-well plate (7.5  105 per well) were
allowed to grow overnight. The cells treated with various concentrations of
DETA-NONOate for 24 h were collected, and viability was determined by
trypan blue exclusion method. The number of viable cells at each concentration and time point was determined in triplicate with a hemacytometer.
Western analysis. Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer containing
50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L DTT, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 10 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate,
1 mmol/L NaF, 0.1 mmol/L orthovanadate, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL
aprotinin, and 0.1 mmol/L PMSF. Western blot was done as previously
described (11).
Determination of ODC activity. MDA-MB-231 cells (5  106 per plate)
were treated with DETA-NONOate (0–60 Amol/L) for 24 h, washed twice with
homogenization buffer [0.1 mmol/L pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 0.1 mmol/L
EDTA, 2.5 mmol/L DTT, and 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate pH (7.2)],
followed by homogenization in 1 mL of homogenization buffer and
centrifugation at 13,000  g for 15 min at 4jC. The supernatant, free from
mitochondria, was used for ODC assay (22).
Immunoprecipitation of labeled cyclin D1 and ODC. [35S]methionineand [35S]cysteine-labeled cyclin D1 was immunoprecipitated from the total
cell lysates, which was prepared for measuring total protein synthesis.
Radiolabeled total cell lysate (500 Ag) was incubated overnight with 1 Ag of
monoclonal anti-cyclin D1 and anti-ODC antibodies in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1% NP40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). The immune complex was
precipitated with 30 AL of Protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
washed four times with lysis buffer, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE.
Northern analysis. Cells were treated with DETA-NONOate for various
time points, and total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy (Qiagen,
Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Equal
amounts (15 Ag per lane) of RNA were resolved by electrophoresis on a
1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotted onto nylon membrane, and probed
using standard protocol (12).
Immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer
containing 50 mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 8), 300 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.5% Igepal Ca-630 (Sigma), 1 mmol/L EDTA, and antiprotease
cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN); 500 Ag of supernatant were precleared by
incubation (4 h at 4jC) once with Protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and once with Protein A/G-agarose preincubated with
preimmune serum. The precleared lysate was adjusted to 150 mmol/L NaCl
and 0.25% Igepal Ca-630 and subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation
on a rotating wheel at 4jC using rabbit antiserum or anti-Akt antibody. The
mixtures were incubated further for 4 h at 4jC with 50 AL of Protein A/Gagarose. After five washes in 50 mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 8), 0.25% Igepal Ca630, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 150 mmol/L NaCl, the immunoprecipitates were
analyzed by kinase assay using myelin basic protein as the substrate.
Inhibition of K-Ras by small interfering RNA. Synthetic small
interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting activated K-Ras (GGAGCUGUUGGCGUAGGCAA) present in MDA-MB-231 cells, and random oligo VIII as a

In this study, we have used human breast cancer cell lines
MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 to study the mechanism
by which DETA-NONOate, an NO donor, increases cell proliferation at physiologic concentrations. These human breast cancer
cell lines with undetectable to low endogenous NOS levels (20)
were exposed to various concentrations of DETA-NONOate, a long
acting NO donor with a half-life of 20 h. We found that nanomolar
concentrations of NO released by 30 to 60 Amol/L DETANONOate significantly increased proliferation in all these breast
cancer cells. Due to comparable % increase in proliferation with
NO treatment, we used MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 to study the
mechanism for increased proliferation. Nanomolar NO treatment
increased the rate of synthesis of some proliferation-related
proteins like cyclin D1 and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)
without altering the mRNA levels or half-lives. Nanomolar
concentrations of NO, as released by 30 to 60 Amol/L DETANONOate, increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase)/
Akt signaling to activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
and its downstream effectors p70 S6 kinase (p70s6k) and
eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF-4E), which are critical
components in the translational machinery. Pharmacologic
inhibition of PI-3 kinase/Akt or Raf/MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)/
ERK1/2 signaling reduced the levels of phosphorylated eIF4E
(peIF4E) and cyclin D1. NO-induced up-regulation of PI-3 kinase/
Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling was found to be mediated by Ras
as inactivation of Ras by farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTase
inhibitor 111) or K-Ras si RNA attenuated the effect of NO on
these signaling cascades. The effects of NO on cell proliferation
were not attenuated in the presence of 1H-[1,2,3]oxadiazolo[4,3a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor. Our
studies therefore suggest that NO induced proliferation in these
breast cancer cells was due to cyclic guanosine 3¶,5¶-monophosphate (cGMP)–independent up-regulation of PI-3 kinase/Akt
and Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling cascades.

(1.5 F 0.4-fold at 30 Amol/L, P < 0.05 and 2.6 F 0.3-fold at 60 Amol/L,
P < 0.05) after exposure to DETA-NONOate (Fig. 1C and D). We also
found a significant increase in ODC protein in MDA-MB-231
(1.7 F 0.3-fold at 30 Amol/L, P < 0.05 and 1.9 F 0.2-fold at 60 Amol/L,
P < 0.05) and in MCF7 (1.6 F 0.3-fold at 30 Amol/L, P < 0.05 and 2.1
F 0.3-fold at 60 Amol/L, P < 0.05) after DETA-NONOate exposure
(Fig. 1C and D). We further assessed the enzymatic activity of ODC
in MDA-MB-231 cell lysates after treatment with DETA-NONOate
(0–60 Amol/L) for 24 h. We observed a significant increase in
enzymatic activity of ODC following treatment of these cells with
DETA-NONOate (0.98 F 0.06 nmol/mg protein at 10 Amol/L,
P < 0.05; 1.1 F 0.05 nmol/mg protein at 30 Amol/L, P < 0.05; and
0.99 F 0.08 nmol/mg protein at 60 Amol/L, P < 0.05) compared with
control (0.76 F 0.04 nmol/mg protein; Fig. 1E).
Nanomolar NO increased the rate of synthesis of cyclin D1
and ODC. To determine whether increased levels of cyclin D1 and
ODC proteins were due to up-regulation of their transcription,
Northern blot analysis was done. Nanomolar NO treatment of
MDA-MB-231 cells did not alter the mRNA levels of cyclin D1 or
ODC when compared with control cells (Fig. 2A). In addition,
blocking cellular transcription with actinomycin D (1 Ag/mL)
did not attenuate NO-induced increase in cyclin D1 (Fig. 2B) and
ODC (data not shown) proteins, suggesting the involvement of
posttranscriptional mechanisms in the process.
Changes in steady-state protein levels can be accomplished by
alterations in either the rate of synthesis or by change in protein
half-life. To determine the effect of NO on the rate of synthesis of
cyclin D1 and ODC, the MDA-MB-231 cells after various treatments
were starved in methionine/cysteine–free growth media and
further pulse labeled for 3 h with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine.
Total cyclin D1 or ODC was immunoprecipitated from the labeled
cell lysates using anti-cyclin D1 or anti-ODC antibodies and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells exposed to
nanomolar NO had increased labeled cyclin D1 (3.1 F 0.3-fold,
P < 0.001) and ODC (3.6 F 0.4-fold, P < 0.001) proteins at 60 Amol/L
DETA-NONOate compared with control cells, suggesting an
increased rate of translation of their mRNAs (Fig. 2C). To ascertain
the potential mechanisms by which nanomolar NO increased
translation of cell cycle proteins, we decided to focus on cyclin D1
as the downstream target of NO for further experiments. To assess
whether NO affected protein stability of cyclin D1, we analyzed
cyclin D1 turnover before and after NO treatment by Western
analysis. Protein degradation was monitored by blocking the
de novo protein synthesis in the cells with cycloheximide
(100 Ag/mL). The half-life of cyclin D1 (f30 min with or without
NO) was unaltered under these conditions, whereas overall cyclin
D1 protein levels were significantly increased with NO treatment
(Fig. 2D). These results indicate that nanomolar NO did not affect
the stability of cyclin D but increased its rate of synthesis.
Nanomolar NO up-regulates PI-3 kinase/pAkt activation in
MDA-MB-231 cells. Increased rate of synthesis of cyclin D1 and
ODC could reflect a direct effect of nanomolar NO on the
translational machinery or result from activation of signaling
pathways, such as those initiated by tyrosine kinase activation. The
PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway plays an important role in human cancer
and has been found to modulate the activity of key translation
factors in the translational machinery (25). To analyze whether
nanomolar NO–induced increase in rate of synthesis of cyclin D1
and ODC was through the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway, we examined
the levels of total and pAkt by immunoblot analysis using total
and phospho-specific antibodies that detected phospho- groups on

control for nonspecific siRNA effects were purchased from Dharmacon
Research (Lafayette, CO) as described (23). Amaxa nucleofecter was used for
the transfection (f85% efficiency) for 24 h, after which the cells were
treated with and without DETA-NONOate for another 24 h, and cell
proliferation was measured.
cGMP assay. cGMP was measured using Enzyme Immunoassay kit from
Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI).
Statistics. Data are presented as mean F SE. Differences between the
groups were analyzed by ANOVA. If overall ANOVA revealed significant
differences, then pairwise comparisons between groups were done using
Student’s t test. Ps < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The
experiments were repeated three to five times, and data from representative
experiments are shown.

Results
Nanomolar NO increased proliferation of breast cancer
cells. In this study, we used lower, physiologic concentrations of
NO (nanomolar; DETA-NONOate at 10–60 Amol/L) to elucidate
the cellular targets and the possible mechanisms by which it
promotes tumor growth. We have determined that 10, 30, and
60 Amol/L DETA-NONOate releases 2, 33, and 52 nmol/L NO in
the culture media as described in Materials and Methods. We
initially assessed the effect of different concentrations of NO on
cell proliferation in human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231,
MCF7, and MDA-MB-468 (data not shown). A significant increase
in viable cells after exposure to 30 Amol/L (26 F 2% for MDA-MB231, P < 0.05 and 27 F 2% for MCF7, P < 0.05) and 60 Amol/L
(53 F 3% for MDA-MB-231, P < 0.01 and 63 F 4% for MCF7,
P < 0.01) of DETA-NONOate was observed compared with control
cells (Fig. 1A). Because the NO-induced % increase in cell
proliferation of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 was very
comparable, we have used MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 for further
experiments. To assess whether the increased proliferation was
due to NO released from DETA-NONOate, MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 cells were coincubated with DETA-NONOate and cPTIO
(50 Amol/L), a well-known NO quencher (24). Coincubation with
cPTIO attenuated NO-induced increase in proliferation of these
cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the increase with DETA-NONOate
(30–60 Amol/L) was due to the NO released from the chemical
compound. To examine whether nanomolar NO affected the rate
of total protein synthesis in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines,
DETA-NONOate–treated cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine for 6 h. Equal amounts of lysates were spotted
on Whatman No. 3MM and washed with TCA, and incorporation
of labeled [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine in protein was measured
in a scintillation counter. We observed a significant increase in
[35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine–labeled proteins in cells exposed
to 30 Amol/L (57 F 3% for MDA-MB-231, P < 0.05 and 46 F 16%
for MCF7, P < 0.05) and 60 Amol/L (118 F 6 for MDA-MB-231,
P < 0.01 and 146 F 8 for MCF7, P < 0.01) of DETA-NONOate,
compared with the control cells (Fig. 1B).
To investigate the mechanism by which nanomolar NO increased
proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, we examined some
of the cell cycle proteins involved in G1-S progression. ODC, which
is strongly implicated in G1 progression, was also assessed in
nanomolar NO–treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. We
observed that nanomolar NO treatment increased the levels of
cyclin D1 and ODC in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1C) and MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 1D). Densitometric scans showed a significant increase in
cyclin D1 protein in MDA-MB-231 (1.6 F 0.3-fold at 30 Amol/L,
P < 0.05 and 2.2 F 0.3-fold at 60 Amol/L, P < 0.05) and in MCF7

(30 Amol/L), a PI-3 kinase inhibitor, decreased the basal levels of
pAkt (50 F 6%, P < 0.05) and cyclin D1 (60 F 7%, P < 0.02) and
attenuated DETA-NONOate (60 Amol/L)–induced increase of pAkt
(60 F 8-fold, P < 0.001) and cyclin D1 (54 F 11-fold, P < 0.02;
Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained when wortmannin, another
PI-3 kinase inhibitor, was used to inhibit pAkt (data not shown).
These results indicated that nanomolar NO–induced increased
cyclin D1 synthesis was possibly via up-regulation of pAkt in MDAMB-231 cells. Activated PI-3 kinase enhances the synthesis of
phosphatidylinositol 3¶-phosphates, which binds to pleckstrin
homology domain of Akt and increases its activation by targeting
it to the cell membrane (26). To assess whether nanomolar NO–
induced activation of Akt was due to increased activity of upstream
PI-3 kinase, lysates from control and nanomolar NO–treated cells
were immunoprecipitated with antibody against regulatory p85

both Ser473 and Thr308 in Akt. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with
60 Amol/L DETA-NONOate increased the levels of pAkt by 1.8 F
0.2-fold (P < 0.01) compared with untreated control cells, whereas
total Akt level remained unchanged (Fig. 3A). To further confirm
whether nanomolar NO–treated cells had increased pAkt activity, a
kinase assay was done, where total Akt was immunoprecipitated
from cell lysates, and the pellets were subjected to kinase assay
using myelin basic protein as substrate. We observed a 3.1 F 0.3fold (P < 0.001) increased phosphorylation of myelin basic protein
(Fig. 3B) in cells treated with 60 Amol/L DETA-NONOate compared

phospho-specific antibody to Ser209 whose phosphorylation was
important to eIF4E activation. There were increased phosphorylation levels of eIF4E by 1.7 F 0.3-fold (P < 0.05) in MDA-MB-231
(Fig. 4A) and 1.8 F 0.2-fold (P < 0.05) in MCF-7 cells after 60 Amol/L
DETA-NONOate treatment. This was also accompanied by a
significant increase in pp70s6k (1.7 F 0.2-fold, P < 0.05 in MDAMB-231 and 1.6 F 0.2-fold, P < 0.05 in MCF-7) at a similar
concentration of the NO donor (Fig. 4B). To elucidate whether
NO-induced activation of mTOR was involved in the increase
of cyclin D1 in MDA-MB-231 cells, we further inhibited mTOR
with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR kinase. A reduction
(53 F 8%) in cyclin D1 levels in rapamycin-treated cells was
observed compared with control, suggesting the involvement of
the pAkt/mTOR pathway in nanomolar NO–induced increase in
cyclin D1 synthesis (Fig. 4C).
FTase inhibitor 111 inhibits nanomolar NO–induced activation of PI-3 kinase/Akt and pERK1/2. Farnesylation of Ras is
required to anchor it to the cell membrane and trigger signaling
through the PI-3 kinase/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways (29). To
explore the possible role of Ras in nanomolar NO–mediated
activation of membrane-bound PI-3 kinase/Akt, Ras was rendered
inactive in MDA-MB-231 cells by FTI (FTase inhibitor 111). FTI
(25 Amol/L) treatment alone was sufficient to reduce the levels of
pAkt in these cells. FTI treatment also attenuated NO-induced
increase in pAkt, suggesting requirement of activated Ras in NOmediated increase in PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling (Fig. 5A). A decline
in the level of cyclin D1 in FTI and NO plus FTI–treated MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 5A) further emphasizes the role of Ras/PI-3

subunit of PI-3 kinase and Western blotted with antibody against
its catalytic p110 subunit. We found that nanomolar NO treatment
increased the association of p110 subunit and p85 subunits of PI-3
kinase (3.2 F 0.3-fold at 60 Amol/L DETA-NONOate, P < 0.001)
compared with control cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting a possible
mechanism for increase in its activity. In addition, for loading
control, we immunoprecipitated p85 from the same treated lysates,
which was blotted with anti-p85 antibody (Fig. 3D).
Nanomolar NO increased the activity of mTOR and its
downstream targets eIF4E and p70s6k. The mTOR is a downstream effector of PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway, which
mediates crucial aspects of Akt-induced oncogenesis (27). To
determine the effect of NO on mTOR activity, Western blot analysis
was done using phospho-specific antibody to Ser2448, which has
been shown to be important in the control of mTOR activity. We
observed that nanomolar NO treatment increased the levels of
phosphorylated mTOR (pmTOR) by 1.8 F 0.3-fold (P < 0.05) in
MDA-MB-231 and 2.1 F 0.4-fold (P < 0.05) in MCF-7 compared
with control cells (Fig. 4A and B). Two translational components,
ribosomal p70s6k and eIF4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP-1), are the
best-characterized downstream effectors of mTOR. 4E-BP-1 binds
to and represses the function of eIF4E, and phosphorylation of
4E-BP-1 dissociates it from eIF4E complex, enhancing a capdependent translation (28). Effect of nanomolar NO treatment on
the phosphorylation state of p70s6k was assessed using phosphospecific antibody to Thr389 and Thr229, sites whose phosphorylation
are vital to p70s6k activation. Effect of NO on the phosphorylation
state of eIF4E was assessed by Western blot analysis using a

examined. Lysates from nanomolar NO–treated and control
cells were Western blotted with phospho-specific antibodies to
Ser259 for pRaf and Ser217/221 for pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2. We
observed that DETA-NONOate (60 Amol/L)–treated cells had
increased levels of pRaf (1.6 F 0.1, P < 0.02), pMEK (1.9 F 0.1,
P < 0.001), and pERK1/2 (2.1 F 0.2, P < 0.001) compared with
control group, whereas the levels of ERK1/2 remained unchanged
(Fig. 5D), suggesting increased Raf/MEK/pERK1/2 signaling in
MDA-MB-231 cells.
To examine whether Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling was involved
in nanomolar NO–induced increase in cyclin D1 levels, PD 98059,
an inhibitor of MEK1/2, was used to inhibit ERK1/2 activity in
MDA-MB-231 cells. After treatment with PD 98059 (30 Amol/L)
inhibitor for 48 h, cells were further exposed to nanomolar NO for
24 h. We observed that DETA-NONOate (60 Amol/L) increased
cyclin D1 (2.1 F 0.7-fold, P < 0.02) expression compared with
control cells, whereas simultaneous treatment of cells with PD
98059 (30 Amol/L) led to a significant inhibition of DETANONOate–induced increase in cyclin D1, suggesting involvement
of Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling in cyclin D1 synthesis (Fig. 5E).
Because pERK1/2 is known to increase the activity of cap-binding
translation factor eIF4E, we assessed the levels of peIF4E and in
the presence of PD 98059. DETA-NONOate (30 Amol/L) induced
increase in peIF4E (1.8 F 0.12, P < 0.02) compared with control
(1.08 F 0.2) and was abolished in cells simultaneously treated
with PD 98059 (Fig. 5F).

kinase/Akt signaling in cyclin D1 synthesis. Because it is reported
that Ras also increases the signaling through the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway, we examined the levels of pERK1/2 in FTI and NO plus
FTI–treated cells. To examine the effect of nanomolar NO on
pERK1/2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, Western blot using a phosphospecific antibody against Thr202/Tyr204 of pERK1/2 was done.
Whereas DETA-NONOate (60 Amol/L) increased the levels of pAkt
(2.15 F 0.07-fold, P < 0.001), pERK1/2 (1.6 F 0.2-fold, P < 0.02), and
cyclin D1 (1.82 F 0.12-fold, P < 0.05) compared with control cells.
In DETA-NONOate–treated cells after simultaneous treatment with
FTI (25 Amol/L), the respective increases in pAkt (P < 0.001) and
cyclin D1 (P < 0.001) were abolished (Fig. 5A). We also observed
that DETA-NONOate (60 Amol/L)–induced increase in cell
proliferation was abolished when the cells were simultaneously
treated with FTI (Fig. 5B). It is reported that K-Ras is highly
activated in MDA-MB-231 cells (30). To further assess the
involvement of K-Ras in NO-induced proliferation, we treated the
cells with K-Ras siRNA, which reduced the level of K-Ras by 65% to
70%. We observed that K-Ras siRNA significantly attenuated NOinduced increase in cell proliferation (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C) in these
cells. The above data suggest that nanomolar NO–mediated
increase of PI-3 kinase/Akt and pERK1/2 was most likely at least
in part mediated through activation of Ras.
To examine the mechanism by which nanomolar NO increased
the levels of pERK1/2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, the levels of pMEK1/
2 and pRaf, which are kinases upstream to ERK1/2, were

Pretreatment of DETA-NONOate (60 Amol/L)–treated cells with
ODQ did not attenuate nanomolar NO–induced increase in the
levels of pERK1/2 (1.6 F 0.2-fold versus 1.9 F 0.3-fold), cyclin D1
(1.8 F 0.3-fold versus 1.7 F 0.2-fold), or pAkt (2.1 F 0.3-fold versus
2.0 F 0.3-fold) compared with control group, suggesting that
cGMP-independent mechanisms were operative in MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 6C). These experiments suggest that nanomolar NO–
mediated Ras activation in MDA-MB-231 cells seems to be cGMP
independent.

Because nanomolar NO has been found to increase Raf/MEK/
ERK1/2 and PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells, we
assessed the possibility of a cross-talk between these pathways
after nanomolar NO treatment. In presence of PD 98059 inhibitors
when the levels of pERK1/2 was lowered at 48 h, nanomolar NO
induced increase in the levels of pAkt was not attenuated,
suggesting the increased signaling through these pathways
occurred independent of each other (data not shown).
Nanomolar NO–induced increase in PI-3 kinase/Akt and
Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is cGMP independent in MDA-MB-231
cells. Because cGMP influences a number of crucial NO-regulated
signaling events, we assessed whether low concentrations of
nanomolar NO–mediated increase in cell proliferation of MDAMB-231 was cGMP dependent. To determine the role of cGMP in
nanomolar NO–induced increase in Raf/MEK/ERK and PI-3
kinase/Akt signaling, cells after various treatments were analyzed
for cGMP levels as described in Materials and Methods.
Pharmacologic inhibitor of guanylate cyclase ODQ (30 Amol/L;
ref. 31) was used to block the production of cGMP in NO-treated
cells. The level of cGMP was found to peak at 3 h of NO treatment
in MDA-MB-231 cells, after which the levels of cGMP declined
(Fig. 6A). In our study, DETA-NONOate (60 Amol/L) treatment
significantly increased cGMP (14.4 F 1.3, P < 0.003 after 3 h and
10.1 F 1.1, P < 0.003 after 6 h) compared with control, whereas
simultaneous treatment of DETA-NONOate treated cells with ODQ
(30 Amol/L) led to a significant decrease (0.8 F 0.2, P < 0.001 at
3 h and 0.7 F 0.18, P < 0.001 at 6 h) in cGMP levels (Fig. 6A). Higher
concentrations of NO (Amol/L), which is associated with cytostasis
and apoptosis, led to an increase in cGMP levels to 40 to 50 pmol/
mL at 3 h (data not shown). Even in the presence of ODQ, when
NO-induced increase in cGMP was abrogated, nanomolar NO
increased the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
Tumor-associated NO, depending on its local concentration and
duration of exposure, can affect tumor growth positively or
negatively by regulating specific signal transduction pathways
(32, 33). Although controversies still persist regarding concentrations of NO, there are substantial experimental evidences that
support a positive association between nanomolar concentrations
of NO and tumor progression (7–9). In this study, we observed that
low concentrations (nanomolar) of NO target the translational
machinery to increase the rate of synthesis of cyclin D1 and ODC
(Fig. 2C), without altering their mRNA levels or half-lives.
Translational control has been predicted for many proliferationrelated proteins after sequence comparison of their 5¶ untranslated
regions (UTR) with other mRNA species (34). Although malignant
cells harbor potentially perturbed translational machinery, there
are also evidences that manipulation of this machinery leads to
cancer development and progression (33, 34). Studies have
identified cyclin D1 and ODC as two integral cell cycle transit
proteins whose cap-dependent transcripts are subject to strong
translational control (33, 34). Recent studies show that posttranscriptional events play a critical role in maintaining high protein

activation of guanylyl cyclase and production of cGMP (38). In our
study, cells pretreated with ODQ, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase,
did not attenuate nanomolar NO–induced increase in pERK, pAkt,
and cyclin D1, which was assessed at 24 h. In addition, nanomolar
NO–induced increase in cell proliferation was also not attenuated
in presence of ODQ, suggesting that NO initiated cGMPindependent mechanisms, which were operative in this malignant
breast cancer cell line. In our study, we observed that NO increased
cell proliferation by up-regulating PI-3 kinase/Akt activity by a
cGMP-independent mechanism. Our results are contrary to the
study where NO promotes endothelial cell migration and neovascularization by increasing PI-3 kinase/Akt activity in a cGMPdependent mechanism (42). Our results are also inconsistent with
the study where NO in low concentrations increases survival of
neurons and endothelial cells by increasing the activity of PI-3
kinase/Akt in a cGMP-mediated manner (43). Inconsistency with
our results could be due to utilization of other NO donors (GSNO
and SNAP) with shorter half-life in other studies, which is in
contrast to our study, where DETA-NONOate, with the longest
half-life of the entire known NO donors, was used. The inconsistency could also be due to other studies using normal cell types
(endothelial and neuronal cells), which have very different
biological settings than the malignant human breast cancer
cells used in our study. In our studies, we were also analyzing

levels of cyclin D1, a potential oncogenic element in tumors (35).
Considerable increase in ODC activity due to up-regulation in the
translation of the ODC mRNA into protein has been found in Rasoverexpressed cells (36). ODC, a key regulatory enzyme in the
biosynthesis of polyamines, is associated with carcinogenesis, and
breast tumor tissues have been found to have 2- to 3-fold higher
polyamine levels than surrounding normal tissues (36). Both cyclin
D1 and ODC mRNA contain highly structured 5¶ UTRs, rendering
them to be less efficiently translated in normal cells (37). In our
study, NO treatment of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells increased
the activity of key components in the translational machinery.
eIF4E is an important regulatory component of the translation
initiation complex that controls the activation of proto-oncogenes
and is present in limiting concentration in the cells. We observed
increased levels of peIF4E in nanomolar NO–treated cells, which
could explain the increased translation of cyclin D1 and ODC, both
of which have lengthy highly structured 5¶ UTR. To our knowledge,
this is the first report where NO, at least, partially up-regulates the
rate of synthesis of cyclin D1 and ODC through the mTOR/eIF4E
pathway.
Biological activities of NO can be mediated by either cGMPdependent (38) or cGMP-independent pathways (39–41). The most
important physiologic effects of NO are mediated by binding to
guanylyl cyclase–coupled specialized heme group, which results in

Spermine/NO), whereas we used DETA-NONOate, which has a
much longer half-life.
Recent studies show that NO regulates a wide range of biological
functions via posttranslational modifications, leading to nitrosylation of critical cysteine residues of proteins in signaling cascade
(40, 41). The reversible regulation of proteins by nitrosothiols has
been established as critical signaling mechanism by nNOS (40).
Nanomolar NO has been reported to activate Ras posttranslationally, due to S-nitrosylation of critical Cys118 residue, which
stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange (44). Ras, a membranebound proto-oncogene, plays a key role as a molecular switch that
links the activation of cell surface receptors with signaling cascades
that control proliferation. Data from our study suggest that
nanomolar NO treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells led to Ras-mediated
increase in PI-3 kinase/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction
pathways. Posttranslational modification of Ras protein, by farnesyl
transferase, is critical for its attachment to the cell membrane for
proper functioning. FTase inhibitor 111 alone decreased the basal
levels of pERK1/2, pAkt, and cyclin D1 and induced cytostasis
(Fig. 5A and B), which suggests the dependence of these cells on
functional Ras for proliferation. Pretreatment with FTase inhibitor
111 also attenuated nanomolar NO–induced increase in pERK1/2,
pAkt, or cyclin D1 and cell proliferation (Fig. 5A and B).

longer-lasting perturbations in the signaling pathways that lead to
proliferation, a sharp contrast to the transient changes detected in
most studies. However, to our knowledge, this is the first report
where NO increases PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling in a cGMPindependent manner by activation of membrane-bound Ras. This
increase in the levels of pAkt is only with lower concentrations of
NO, whereas higher concentrations (micromolar) decrease the
levels of pAkt-inducing apoptosis (11).
In this study, we observed that NO up-regulates ERK1/2
signaling at least in part by activating Ras in a cGMP-independent
manner. Our results are inconsistent with report where NO
mediates cGMP-dependent activation of ERK1/2 to promote
migration of mouse mammary tumor cells (19). There is
probability that in these NOS-overexpressing mouse mammary
tumors, Ras or its associated adaptor proteins involved in
amplification of Ras signaling were not adequately expressed,
thereby preventing the effects of NO on Ras modifications to be
manifested. Our results are also inconsistent with those of another
study conducted in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, where
NO-mediated cGMP-dependent ERK1/2 activation was very
transient (1 h) in nature (33). The inconsistency with our results
where we get persistent ERK1/2 activation is probably because
other studies used short half-life NO donors (DEA/NO and

Furthermore, K-Ras siRNA attenuated NO-induced cell proliferation
(Fig. 5C), indicating a critical role of Ras in nanomolar NO–
mediated cell proliferation signaling. MDA-MB-231 is one of the
most malignant breast cancer cell lines, which contains numerous
genetic mutations leading to overexpression of potential oncogenes.
Growth factor receptor binding protein 2, which complexes with
adaptor proteins involved in Ras signaling and HER-2, which
increases the sensitivity of Ras signaling, are overexpressed in breast
cancer cells (44–47). In this biological setting, low concentration of
NO could amplify Ras signaling by inducing conformational changes
of the membrane-bound Ras protein. Because NO has been shown
to promote guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras to promote RasGTP levels, there is also a possibility that NO might be modulating
Rheb/mTOR activity. The major difference between mode of action
of Ras and that of Rheb is that in case of Ras, GTP charging is
necessary for ability of Ras to bind and activate its effectors, whereas
Rheb GTP charging is necessary only for effector function (48).
In summary, our data show that low concentrations of NO
increases the rate of synthesis of cyclin D1 and ODC in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cell lines by activating mTOR, eIF4E, and p70s6k in
the translational machinery via PI-3 kinase/Akt and RAF/MEK/
ERK1/2 signaling cascades. The up-regulation of Akt and ERK1/2
activity was due to NO-induced cGMP-independent Ras activation.
Results from our studies may have important clinical implications.
Most authors have found increased expression of iNOS (18, 49) and
eNOS expression (50) compared with weak to undetectable
expression seen in benign breast epithelium. Although iNOS is
expressed in breast cancer, the activity is at least one to two orders
of magnitude lower than the enzyme activity associated with
cytotoxicity and apoptosis (51). Furthermore, epithelial and
stromal expression of eNOS has been shown in phyllodes tumor,
and there is a positive correlation between eNOS expression and
tumor grade (50). On this basis, it has been suggested that NO may
provide a positive growth signal within the tumor. Our studies have
elucidated the potential molecular mechanisms by which this may
occur. Further studies are being planned to confirm these in vitro
findings in an animal model in vivo.

Figure 6. A, DETA NONOate increases cGMP levels in MDA-MB-231 cells,
which were abrogated by ODQ. Cells treated with DETA-NONOate (60 Amol/L)
or DETA-NONOate plus ODQ for 3 or 6 h were utilized to measure cGMP as
described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of four experiments;
bars, SE. **, P V 0.003; ***, P V 0.001. B, DETA-NONOate–induced increase
in cell proliferation was not attenuated by ODQ. Cells were treated with
DETA-NONOate or DETA-NONOate plus ODQ for 24 h, after which they were
harvested and subjected to cell counting by trypan blue exclusion method.
Columns, mean of four experiments; bars, SE. C, DETA-NONOate–induced
increase in pERK1/2, pAkt, and cyclin D1 was not abrogated by ODQ. Cells were
treated with DETA-NONOate or DETA-NONOate plus ODQ for 24 h, after which
they were prepared for Western blot analysis for pERK1/2, pAkt, and cyclin
D1 using the respective antibodies. Representative autoradiograph of four
independent experiments.
