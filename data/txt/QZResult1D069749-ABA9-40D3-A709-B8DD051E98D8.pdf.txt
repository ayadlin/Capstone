ABSTRACT
A chromosomal translocation results in production of an oncogenic PAX8-PPARG
fusion protein (PPFP) in thyroid carcinomas. PAX8 is a thyroid transcription factor,
and PPARG is a transcription factor that plays important roles in adipocytes and
macrophages. PPFP retains the DNA binding domains of both proteins; however, the
genomic binding sites of PPFP have not been identified, and only limited data exist to
characterize gene expression in PPFP thyroid carcinomas. Therefore, the oncogenic
function of PPFP is poorly understood. We expressed PPFP in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells
and used ChIP-seq to identify PPFP genomic binding sites (PPFP peaks) and RNAseq to characterize PPFP-dependent gene expression. PPFP peaks (~20,000) include
known PAX8 and PPARG binding sites and are enriched with both motifs, indicating
that both DNA binding domains are functional. PPFP binds to and regulates many
genes involved in cancer-related processes. In PCCL3 thyroid cells, PPFP binds to
adipocyte PPARG target genes in preference to macrophage PPARG target genes,
consistent with the pro-adipogenic nature of PPFP and its ligand pioglitazone in
thyroid cells. PPFP induces oxidative stress in thyroid cells, and pioglitazone increases
susceptibility to further oxidative stress. Our data highlight the complexity of PPFP as
a transcription factor and the numerous ways that it regulates thyroid oncogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

be capable of binding to PAX8 and PPARG response
elements and potentially regulating target genes of both
transcription factors. However, no data exist to define
the genomic binding sites of PPFP, and the largest study
characterizing global gene expression patterns in human
PPFP carcinomas consisted of only 7 cases [5]. Given
these limited data, the mechanism of oncogenesis is poorly
understood (reviewed in [6]).
PAX8 is a member of the paired box family of
transcription factors and is essential for thyroid gland
development [7, 8]. In the mature thyroid, PAX8 drives
the expression of numerous thyroid-specific genes [8].
PPARG is a member of the nuclear receptor family of
transcription factors. It has no identified role in the normal
thyroid and is expressed at extremely low levels in that
organ. PPARG is the master regulator of adipogenesis
[9], and also plays an important role in macrophage

Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine
malignancy, and its incidence has increased nearly 3-fold
since 1990 [1, 2]. The majority of thyroid carcinomas
contain one of a small number of driver mutations, such
as BRAF or RAS mutations, gene fusions involving RET,
or gene fusions between PAX8 and PPARG (reviewed
in [3]). The PAX8- peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma (PPARG) gene fusion is a consequence
of a translocation between chromosomes 2 and 3, and
is found in ~30% of follicular thyroid carcinomas and
~5% of follicular variant papillary carcinomas. The
resulting PAX8-PPARG fusion protein (PPFP) is unusual
in that it is the fusion of two transcription factors and it
retains the DNA binding domains (DBDs) of both parent
proteins [4]. Thus, at least in principle, PPFP should

development, where it promotes an anti-inflammatory
phenotype [10]. Synthetic agonist ligands for PPARG
such as pioglitazone are insulin sensitizers and hence
are used to treat type 2 diabetes. PPARG ligands also
are ligands for PPFP. In a mouse model of PPFP thyroid
carcinoma, pioglitazone was highly therapeutic, greatly
shrinking thyroid size and preventing metastatic disease
[11]. Pioglitazone was strongly pro-adipogenic in these
murine thyroid tumors, converting the thyroid cells into
lipid-laden adipocyte-like cells. Although this indicates
that PPFP is strongly PPARG-like in the presence of
pioglitazone, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic
efficacy of pioglitazone in this mouse model of PPFP
thyroid carcinoma is not known.
There are no existing cell lines from PPFP thyroid
carcinomas. However, PPFP has been stably expressed
in the PCCL3 rat thyroid cell line at a level comparable
to that in human thyroid cancers, herein denoted PPFP
cells [12]. PPFP expression confers upon PCCL3 cells an
increased ability to invade through Matrigel and to form
colonies in soft agar, both signs of cellular transformation
[12]. Thus, PPFP cells are a useful cell culture model to
study PPFP-dependent oncogenesis, and potentially, the
response to pioglitazone. PCCL3 cells also have been used
to create cell culture models of thyroid carcinomas caused
by oncogenic driver mutations in BRAF [13] and RAS
[14], and RET gene fusions [15].
Here, we have used RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq) to study the gene expression of PPFP cells versus
control empty vector (EV) cells, cultured with and
without pioglitazone. We also performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation-deep
sequencing
(ChIP-seq)
to identify the PPFP binding sites within the PCCL3
cell genome, and integrated the results with the gene
expression data and publicly-available PAX8 and PPARG
ChIP-seq data. The results provide novel insights into the
transcriptional regulatory activity of PPFP, its oncogenic
actions, and the response to pioglitazone.

down). The differentially expressed genes in all of these
comparisons are highly overlapping (Figure 1). In contrast,
there were no differentially expressed genes in EV cells
cultured with versus without pioglitazone, consistent with
the very low expression level of endogenous PPARG in
thyroid cells and the specificity of pioglitazone. Figure 1
shows that 156 of the 250 genes differentially expressed
in PPFP cells cultured with versus without pioglitazone
also are differentially expressed in PPFP cells versus
EV cells cultured without pioglitazone. The PPFP and
pioglitazone-induced changes are in the same direction for
130 (83%) of these 156 genes (48 up, 82 down), indicating
that pioglitazone reinforces most of the PPFP-induced
changes. However, for 26 genes (17%), the changes were
in opposite directions such that pioglitazone partially or
completely reversed the effects of PPFP.

PPFP regulates processes related to oncogenesis
Gene expression changes in PPFP cells versus
EV cells in the absence of pioglitazone potentially are
relevant to the oncogenic actions of PPFP. We subjected
this comparison to a functional enrichment analysis using
Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways [16,
17]. We identified 162 enriched gene sets (FDR<0.05),
55 of which were induced by PPFP and 107 repressed.
The 15 induced and 15 repressed gene sets with the lowest
q-values are shown in Table 1, and the full list is provided
in Supplemental Table S1. Many of the induced gene sets
involve processes directly related to cancer biology. For
example, gene sets related to the cell cycle include MCM
complex, deoxyribonucleotide biosynthetic process, DNA
replication, and others. Three cell cycle-related genes
within these gene sets (Ccnb1, Cdk1 and Plk3) were
investigated further and were also found to be induced at
the protein level by PPFP (Figure 2). Consistent with the
enrichment of cell cycle-related gene sets, cellular DNA

RESULTS
Overview of genes regulated by PPFP in the
absence and presence of pioglitazone
An RNA-seq analysis was performed on RNA
from PPFP cells versus EV cells treated with or without
pioglitazone. PPFP regulated the expression of 1541
genes (628 up, 913 down) in the comparison of PPFP
cells versus EV cells without pioglitazone (FDR <0.05
and fold change >2). When both cell lines were cultured
with pioglitazone, slightly more genes were differentially
expressed (2078; 877 up, 1201 down). In a comparison
of PPFP cells cultured with versus without pioglitazone,
250 genes were differentially expressed (95 up, 155

PPFP can induce or repress PAX8-regulated genes

content analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that a
greater fraction of PPFP cells than EV cells are in the S
and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and a lesser fraction
are in G1 (Figure 3).
Other highly significant cancer-related processes
were related to proteasome/protein folding, immune
function and oxidative stress (Table 1 and Supplemental
Table S1). Gene sets related to mitochondria/lipids also
were enriched, consistent with PPARG-like activity of
PPFP. We confirmed the induction by PPFP of two such
PPARG target genes, Acaa2 and Plin1, at the protein level
(Figure 2).
Twenty-two of the 107 repressed gene sets contain
the word morphogenesis, differentiation or development
(Tables 1 and S1), consistent with the expectation that,
as an oncogene, PPFP enforces a less differentiated
state. The repressed genes include several involved in
thyroid differentiation, including Fgfr2 [18], Hhex [19],
Foxe1 [20], Hes1 [21] and Notch1 [22], the latter three
of which were confirmed at the protein level (Figure
2). The repressed gene sets also include cell adhesion,
extracellular matrix, and several related terms. Repressing
these gene sets could facilitate invasion and metastases.
We confirmed PPFP-dependent repression of the cell
adhesion protein Icam5 at the protein level (Figure 2).

PAX8 induces thyroid-specific genes such as Tg,
but only limited data exist to define PAX8-responsive
genes more broadly. In a previous publication [23],
siRNA knockdown of PAX8 in PCCL3 cells yielded 601
differentially expressed genes that also were tested in our
data set. In general the magnitude of change was modest
in the siRNA experiment, with 296 genes showing a fold
change >1.2 (siPAX8 induced 175 genes and repressed
121). We determined what fraction of these siPAX8responsive genes was differentially expressed in PPFP
cells versus EV cells cultured without pioglitazone (using
FDR<0.05 and fold change >1.5 as cut-offs). As shown in
Table 2, slightly more than half of siPAX8-regulated genes
are regulated by PPFP, and the direction of regulation
is discordant about 2/3 of the time (p = 0.00015 for
observing this level of discordance by chance; Fisher’s
exact test). Since induction by siPAX8 implies repression
by PAX8 and vice versa, the data indicate that PAX8 and
PPFP regulate gene expression in the same direction for
~2/3 of the genes, and in opposite directions for ~1/3.

and with pioglitazone. RNA-seq data are normalized relative to EV cells cultured without pioglitazone. The genes are organized by
concepts related to the gene set names with which they are associated, as described in Results. Although grouped together in one figure, the
expression of these proteins without and with pioglitazone is presented at several different places within Results.

PPFP regulates genes related to fatty acid
metabolism and mitochondrial function,
especially in the presence of pioglitazone

that 117 gene sets are enriched in the comparison of
PPFP cells cultured with versus without pioglitazone (52
induced, 65 repressed) (Supplemental Table S2). The 10
most significant gene sets are all induced by pioglitazone,
and all relate to fatty acid metabolism and PPAR activity
(Table 3). Among the PPARG target genes in these gene
sets, we confirmed the inductions of Acaa2 and Plin1 at
the protein level, as noted previously (Figure 2).

The 55 induced gene sets in the comparison of PPFP
cells versus EV cells in the absence of pioglitazone include
several related to mitochondria, fatty acids and lipids, such
as mitochondrial envelope, lipid particle, and cellular
response to fatty acid (Tables 1 and S1). The induced
genes in these gene sets include adipocyte PPARG target
genes such as Acaa2 and Plin1, demonstrating that PPFP is
PPARG-like on a subset of target genes. This is consistent
with the fact that several PPARG target genes have been
shown to be induced in human PPFP thyroid carcinomas
[5]. However, the PPARG-like activity of PPFP is much
more striking in the presence of pioglitazone. We found

Overview of the PPFP cistrome
We performed ChIP-seq analysis on PPFP to begin
to understand the DNA binding properties of PPFP and the
genes it is likely to regulate through direct interactions.
Using an FDR<.05, we identified 20,277 PPFP peaks in
the PCCL3 cell genome. As has been found previously

for PAX8 [23] and PPARG [24], most PPFP peaks are
intergenic. However, we observed an enrichment of PPFP
peaks in genic regions, and most strikingly within 1 kb
of transcription start sites (TSS’s) (2.9-fold enriched)
(Figure 4). PPFP peaks also are enriched 2-fold from -5 to
-1 kb of TSS’s and 1.7-fold in first introns, and are underrepresented (0.8-fold) in intergenic regions.
Since PPFP contains DBDs from both PAX8 and
PPARG, in principle it could bind to the DNA motifs
recognized by both transcription factors. This is what
was observed, as we identified the PPARG and PAX8
motifs de novo as the top two most overrepresented
sequences within the peak regions using HOMER [25].
Overall, 65% of PPFP peaks contain a PPARG motif
and/or a PAX8 motif, and these partially overlap (Figure
5A). An unexpected finding was that 50% of the peaks
with a PAX8 motif also contain a PPARG motif. This is
interesting because a much lower rate of PPARG motifs
would be expected near PAX8 motifs if PPFP uses only
one of the two DBDs for every binding site. To investigate
if the co-localizations of the two motifs were due to falsepositive matches of the motif position weight matrices to
the sequences, we examined the motif locations relative
to the peak centers. The results show that both the PAX8
and PPARG motifs are centered within these PPFP peaks,
as would be expected if both are functionally relevant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to DNA binding (Figure 5B). This suggests that PPFP
prefers to bind to the subset of PAX8 motifs that have
nearby PPARG motifs. To evaluate this further, we took
advantage of the fact that a ChIP-seq analysis has been
published for PAX8 in PCCL3 cells [23]. We first filtered
the PAX8 peaks by whether they contained at least one
PAX8 motif, to remove potential false positive peaks
that could confound the analysis. We then asked what
fraction of the PAX8 peaks that contain a PAX8 motif and
do or do not overlap with our PPFP peaks also contain
a PPARG motif. As shown in Figure 5C, PPARG motifs
are enriched in the PAX8 peaks to which PPFP also binds
(odds ratio=1.9, p-value<2.2e-16, Fisher’s exact test),
confirming that PPFP preferentially binds to the subset of
PAX8 peaks that also contain a PPARG motif.

Overview of genes and gene sets containing PPFP
peaks
PPFP peaks were found to encompass a number
of known functional response elements in classic PAX8
and PPARG responsive genes. For example, PPFP peaks
encompass the PAX8 response element in the Tg promoter
[26] and the PPARG response element in the Aqp7
promoter [27].

All 4 gene sets are induced by PPFP.
One hundred sixty eight GO terms were identified as
enriched with PPFP peaks (FDR<0.05), after associating
peaks with the gene having the nearest TSS (Supplemental
Table S3). Nine of the 15 GO terms with the lowest
q-values are related to immune function, development/
differentiation, or lipid metabolism, and the GO terms
in the full list include additional cancer-related concepts
such as negative regulation of programmed cell death,
regulation of cell migration, G1/S transition of mitotic cell
cycle, and Wnt receptor signaling pathway.
In subsequent analyses, we focused on gene sets that
are both enriched in the ChIP-seq analysis and enriched
among the differentially expressed genes by RNA-seq
analysis. Eight such gene sets were induced in PPFP cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

versus EV cells cultured without pioglitazone, and 13
were repressed (Table 4). Seven of the 8 induced gene sets
relate to mitochondria, and include direct PPARG target
genes such as Plin1. The one additional induced gene set,
G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, includes genes such
as Plk3 that promote progression through the cell cycle
and cell division. The inductions of Plin1 and Plk3 were
confirmed at the protein level, as noted previously (Figure
2).
In contrast, the 13 repressed gene sets relate
mostly to protein signaling (4 gene sets), morphogenesis/
development/differentiation (4 gene sets), and cell
communication/extracellular matrix/adhesion (4 gene
sets). The repressed genes in these gene sets include the

However, 16 gene sets were enriched and repressed by
PPFP, encompassing 59 unique genes. This suggests that,
when regulating gene sets through PAX8 motifs distant
from the TSS, PPFP tends to act in a repressive manner.
Furthermore, 11 of these 16 gene sets contain the words
morphogenesis, development or organ formation (Table
5A), implying that the effects of PAX8 binding at a
distance >10kb upstream from TSS’s are primarily antidifferentiation effects of PPFP.
In contrast, analysis of PPFP peaks with PAX8
motifs ≤10kb from TSS’s yielded 4 gene sets that were
enriched in the ChIP and induced by PPFP, and no gene
sets that were enriched and repressed. Thus, at the gene set
level, there is a complete separation of PPFP as a repressor
when the target genes have peaks with PAX8 motifs
>10kb upstream from the TSS, versus an activator when
the PAX8 peaks are ≤10kb. The 4 induced gene sets all
relate to mitochondria and lipids (Table 5B), and contain
24 unique genes. In contrast to the analysis of PPFP peaks
with PAX8 motifs, analysis of peaks with PPARG motifs
did not identify differences in gene set activation versus
repression based on distance from the TSS (data not
shown).

PPFP functions through its PAX8 DBD to
repress gene sets when bound at a distance from
transcription start sites, but to induce gene sets
when bound close to transcriptional start sites
We classified PPFP peaks as to whether they contain
a PAX8 motif or a PPARG motif, and whether they are
≤10kb from a TSS or >10kb upstream from a TSS. We
then performed gene set enrichment analyses on these
4 groups of PPFP peaks using ChIP-Enrich [28] and
compared the results with the RNA-seq analysis of PPFP
cells versus EV cells without pioglitazone.
Analysis of PPFP peaks with PAX8 motifs >10kb
upstream from TSS’s yielded no gene sets that were
enriched with ChIP-seq peaks and induced by PPFP.

Why is pioglitazone adipogenic in PPFPexpressing cells?
When mice with PPFP thyroid carcinomas are
treated with pioglitazone, metastatic disease is prevented
and the primary thyroid tumors shrink markedly [11].
The most striking part of the response is that pioglitazone
is highly adipogenic, causing large accumulations
of intracellular lipid and the induction of numerous
adipocyte PPARG target genes in the thyroids. In contrast,
pioglitazone has no effect on the thyroid glands of control
mice. The induction of adipocyte genes is a hallmark
of the pioglitazone response in cultured PPFP cells as
shown here, too (Tables 3 and S2). Since PPARG is the
master regulator of adipogenesis, the data indicate that
pioglitazone turns PPFP into a strongly PPARG-like
transcription factor. However, PPARG also is expressed
in macrophages, where it plays an important role in
promoting an anti-inflammatory “M2” phenotype [10].
Why does PPFP favor the induction of an adipocyte
phenotype over a macrophage phenotype in the thyroid?
To begin to understand this, we took advantage of the
fact that a PPARG ChIP-seq analysis has been published
comparing a mouse adipocyte cell line with mouse
macrophages [29]. This study thus identified genes with
PPARG peaks in mouse adipocytes but not macrophages,
and vice versa. Using HomoloGene, we assessed the
overlap between mouse genes with a nearby (≤10kb
from TSS) PPARG peak and rat genes with at least one
nearby PPFP peak. We found that PPFP binds near 34%
of homologs with an adipocyte PPARG peak versus
only 25% of homologs with a macrophage PPARG peak

(Supplemental Table S4, p = 0.0022). The fact that PPFP
in the thyroid preferentially binds to adipocyte PPARG
target genes likely underlies the observation that the
pioglitazone response is adipocyte-like.

PPFP cells with pioglitazone versus PPFP cells without
pioglitazone. Only three gene sets qualified, and all were
induced by PPFP without pioglitazone and repressed by
pioglitazone. The 3 gene sets relate to oxidative stress:
Glutathione metabolism (KEGG), peroxidase activity
(GO) and arachidonic acid metabolism (KEGG). There
are 49 unique, differentially expressed genes within these
gene sets, including multiple glutathione peroxidases,
glutathione reductase, glutathione synthase, glutathione
S-transferases, and peroxiredoxins (Supplemental Table
S5). Based on these data, we hypothesized that PPFP
induces oxidative stress and that pioglitazone impairs
the ability of the cell to mount an appropriate antioxidant
response.
To assess this, we evaluated oxidative stress in PPFP

Why is pioglitazone therapeutic in the mouse
model of PPFP thyroid carcinoma?
We reasoned that genes or pathways regulated
in opposite directions by PPFP without pioglitazone
versus PPFP with pioglitazone may be involved in the
therapeutic efficacy of this drug. We therefore identified
GO or KEGG terms in our RNA-seq data that are both
induced (or repressed) in PPFP cells versus EV cells
without pioglitazone, and repressed (or induced) in

with PPFP peaks, p < 2.2e-16, Fisher’s exact test.

and EV cells by flow cytometry after treatment with the
reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive dye CellROX
Deep Red. PPFP cells had greater ROS than EV cells,
cultured in the absence of pioglitazone (Figure 6A).
Analysis of PPFP cells cultured ± a low dose (50 μM) of
the reactive peroxide tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)
and pioglitazone showed that pioglitazone increased ROS
in the presence of TBHP (Figure 6B) but not in its absence
(Figure 6C). In contrast, in EV cells, pioglitazone did not
increase ROS regardless of the presence or absence of
TBHP (Figure 6D, 6E). These data support the hypothesis
that PPFP induces oxidative stress, and that pioglitazone
increases the susceptibility of PPFP cells to further
oxidative stress. The data suggest that the therapeutic
efficacy of pioglitazone in PPFP thyroid cancer may at
least in part relate to synergism with cellular stressors to
induce oxidative stress, cytotoxicity and ultimately, cell
death.

Gene expression data in PPFP thyroid carcinomas also
are very limited - the largest study included only 7 PPFP
carcinomas [5], and given patient heterogeneity, only
limited conclusions can be drawn.
Here, we identified ~20,000 putative PPFP binding
sites in the rat PCCL3 cell line genome, and found
that these binding sites are enriched within -5 kb of
transcription start sites and in first introns. PPFP peaks
encompass known PAX8 and PPARG binding sites,
indicating that both DBDs within PPFP are functional.
Interestingly, PPFP preferentially binds to the subset of
PAX8 peaks that also contain PPARG motifs, implying
that the PPARG portion of PPFP is particularly important
in directing PPFP to its target genes. The fact that many
PAX8 binding sites have a nearby PPARG motif also
suggests PPARG may play a role in normal thyroid
biology. Thyroid-specific deletion of murine Pparg has
not been reported, but would provide a means to address
this question.
RNA-seq analysis shows that PPFP regulates the
expression of ~1500 genes in the absence of pioglitazone
and ~2000 genes in its presence. In general, pioglitazone
reinforces PPFP-dependent gene expression, but in
17% of cases it reverses the effects of PPFP. PPFP
regulates many genes known to be regulated by PAX8
in thyrocytes or PPARG in adipocytes. For the latter, the
gene regulation by PPFP is particularly striking in the
presence of pioglitazone. Although gene expression data
in human PPFP thyroid carcinomas are very limited, there
is excellent overlap between the human data and our data,
including the induction of PPARG target genes.
We identified an unusual dichotomy in the function
of PPFP for genes with peaks containing PAX8 motifs.
When such motifs are located >10kb upstream from the
TSS, the functional consequence tends to be gene set
repression, including processes related to morphogenesis
and development. In contrast, when such peaks are close
to the TSS, the consequence tends to be gene set induction.
This dichotomy likely reflects the summed activity of
transcriptional activators and repressors brought to the
target gene, but the factors that determine these differences
are unknown.
The data are relevant to the biology of PPFP in
human thyroid cancer. For example, PPFP induces gene
sets related to the cell cycle, and represses gene sets
related to differentiation. In a transgenic mouse model
of PPFP thyroid carcinoma, pioglitazone was highly
therapeutic [11], and this has led to a clinical trial in
patients (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01655719). A
remarkable aspect of this response is that the drug transdifferentiated the surviving thyroid cancer cells into
adipocyte-like cells. Our ChIP-seq data show that, in
PCCL3 thyroid cells, PPFP binds to adipocyte PPARG
target genes in preference to macrophage PPARG target
genes, likely explaining why pioglitazone is specifically
pro-adipogenic.

Similarity of gene regulation by PPFP in PCCL3
cells and human thyroid carcinomas
To judge the clinical relevance of the PPFP cell
ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses, it would be ideal to
compare these data to similar data from human PPFP
carcinomas. However, human ChIP-seq data would be
difficult if not impossible to obtain due to the fact that
antibodies to endogenous PPFP also bind to PAX8 or
PPARG (our PPFP is epitope-tagged), as well as the
fact that PPFP thyroid carcinomas are uncommon.
Furthermore, the largest gene expression profiling study
of human PPFP thyroid carcinomas included only 7 cases
[5]. This study identified 275 genes that were differentially
expressed in 7 PPFP follicular carcinomas versus 82 nonPPFP thyroid tumors and 4 normal thyroids. Of those
275 genes, 264 have rat homologs, and we found a 31%
overlap with differential expression in our RNA-seq data
and 22% overlap with our ChIP-seq data (Supplemental
Table S6). This overlap includes numerous PPARG target
genes, including ANGPTL4 and AQP7, which were two
of the six most highly induced genes in the human PPFP
carcinomas. We also found that the set of 49 ROS-related
genes described above is induced in the 7 PPFP follicular
carcinomas versus the non-PPFP follicular carcinomas
(p = 0.0007, Fisher’s exact test, Supplemental Table S7),
suggesting that PPFP also causes increased ROS in human
thyroid carcinomas.

DISCUSSION
PPFP is an unusual oncoprotein in that it is the
fusion of two transcription factors, PAX8 and PPARG,
and it retains the DBDs of both parent proteins. However,
until now there were no studies to determine whether
PPFP actively bound both PAX8 and PPARG target genes.

ChIP-seq assay

It is plausible that the therapeutic efficacy of
pioglitazone is at least in part due to its adipogenic prodifferentiation effects. However, our data uncovered
another potential contributing factor. We found that PPFP
cells have higher expression of ROS-related genes than
EV cells, and this reflects higher levels of oxidative
stress. Pioglitazone caused the PPFP cells to develop even
greater levels of ROS when exposed to a low dose of
the reactive peroxide TBHP, indicating that pioglitazone
sensitizes PPFP cells to potential oxidant stressors.
These data suggest pioglitazone might sensitize PPFP
thyroid cancers in vivo to oxidative stressors, leading to
increased cytotoxicity and cell death. Substantiation of this
hypothesis could lead to approaches to further enhance the
efficacy of this drug.

PPFP cells were cultured with pioglitazone
for 16 hours, crosslinked with formaldehyde,
sonicated to an average DNA size of 300 to 500 bp,
and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody at
1:500 overnight at 4C using the protocol of Upstate
Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), except that
immunoprecipitation was performed with Dynabeads G
(Life Technologies). ChIP and input DNA were used for
next generation library construction and DNA sequencing
on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 per the manufacturer’s protocol
using 50 nt single-end reads, performed by the University
of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. Four samples were
barcoded and run on one lane, obtaining an average of 31
million reads per sample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RNA-seq assay
Cell culture

PPFP and EV cells were treated with 1 μM
pioglitazone or vehicle for 16 hours. Total RNA was
prepared using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Three
independent experiments were performed. Library
construction (Illumina TruSeq RNA) and sequencing
on an Illumina HiSeq2000 using 50 nt paired end reads
were per the manufacturer’s protocols, performed by
the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. The
samples were barcoded and loaded onto the same run, with
all samples from each experiment run on the same two
lanes; an average of 88 million reads were obtained per
sample.
PPFP ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data were deposited
in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession
ID GSE70354.

PCCL3-PPFP cells stably express human PPFP with
a 3xMyc tag at the amino terminus, and PCCL3-EV cells
have been stably transfected with the empty vector [12].
PPFP and EV cells were cultured as previously described
[12]. In some experiments, the cells were treated with 1
μM pioglitazone (from a 1 mM stock solution in DMSO)
or vehicle for the times indicated prior to harvest.

Antibodies
Antibodies were obtained from the following
sources as indicated: Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA) - beta actin #8457, Ccnb1 #12231, Hes1
#11988, Myc tag #2276, Notch1 #3608 and Plk3 #4896;
Proteintech (Chicago, IL) - Acaa2 #11111-1-AP and
Icam5 #12759-1-AP; Sigma (St. Louis, MO) - Foxe1
#SAB2100840; and Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY)
- Cdk1 #MA5-11472 and Plin1 #PA1-1051.

ChIP-seq data analysis
The quality of reads were assessed using FastQC
[30]. There were 29.3 and 33.5 million reads sequenced
for PPFP ChIP and input samples, respectively. ChIP-seq
and input reads were aligned to the rat reference genome
(rn4) using BWA (version 0.5.9-r16) with default options.
MACS2 (2.0.10.20131216beta) was used to call peaks
using a q-value < 0.05 cutoff [31]. Peaks were then filtered
by PePr (1.0.5) [32] to remove artifacts due to high PCR
duplications. Peak boundaries were re-defined as 150 bp
from the peak mode, and over-represented motifs were
identified from the peaks by MEME(4.9.1), searching
for the top 10 motifs with minimal width of 10bp and
maximal width of 18bp. The most over-represented motif
(shown in Figure 5A) was very close to the PPARG motif
previously reported [24, 29, 33] and was used as the
position weight matrix (PWM) for the PPARG motif in all
following analyses. Motif occurrences in the peaks were

Flow cytometry
DNA content was analyzed by propidium iodide
staining and oxidative stress was analyzed with CellROX
Deep Red per the vendor’s protocols (Life Technologies).
For the oxidative stress experiments, the cells were
cultured ±1 μM pioglitazone for 2 days and ±50 μM
TBHP for the final hour. Approximately 10,000 cells per
condition were analyzed in the University of Michigan
Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core on
a MACSQuant cytometer.

detected by FIMO(4.9.1) using default parameters and the
PWM output from MEME. The presence of PPARG and
PAX8 motifs in PPFP peaks was detected with the MEME/
FIMO suite, and was also independently discovered using
another motif discovery tool, HOMER [25], as the top
2 known enriched motifs. Of the top 35 motifs found
by HOMER, none were related to Myc, assuring that
potential nonspecific binding caused by using a Myc tag
antibody should be negligible.
Peaks were annotated to the genome with respect to
gene features using an adapted HOMER script. If a peak
had two or more annotations, a priority was assigned based
on the order from left to right in Figure 4, as follows: -1 to
+1kb (relative to the TSS), -1 to -5kb, -5 to -10kb, exon,
UTR, intron, and intergenic. We define “intergenic” as
outside of the region between 10kb upstream from a TSS
and its 3’UTR.
PAX8 ChIP-seq raw read data (GSE26871) were
downloaded and analyzed as described above. The PAX8
motif (shown in Figure 5A) was found as the top hit by
MEME searching for the top 10 overrepresented motifs
with minimal width of 10bp and maximal width of 15bp.
The PAX8 motif identified here closely matches that
previously published [23].
PPARG ChIP-seq peaks from mouse adipocyte
and macrophage cells were downloaded from GEO
(GSE21314).

was performed with ChIP-Enrich, a logistic-regressionbased method that uses a smoothing spline to empirically
adjust for gene locus length and mappability [28]. Gene
set enrichment results were corrected for multiple testing
using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction. Only gene
sets with ≤500 genes were reported, as gene sets with
larger numbers of genes are more general and provide
limited biological insight.
