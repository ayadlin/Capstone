BACKGROUND: Cystectomy is the standard treatment for patients with infiltrating bladder cancer, but conservative
treatment with cystoscopic resection followed by radiochemotherapy may be an alternative for highly selected
patients. The addition of gemcitabine to cisplatin and radiotherapy may enhance disease control. METHODS: The
long-term clinical outcomes of 26 patients enrolled in a previously published dose-finding study and a prematurely
discontinued phase 2 trial were evaluated. All the patients underwent transurethral tumor resection followed by a
radical dose of external radiotherapy administered at the same time as cisplatin and weekly gemcitabine therapy.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 74 months, the projected 5-year clinical outcomes were a 70.1% overall survival
rate, a 78.9% disease-specific survival rate, and a 73.8% bladder-intact survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term
follow-up data from the current study confirmed that the addition of gemcitabine to radiotherapy and cisplatin is
safe and leads to good local and distant disease control. The concomitant administration of cisplatin may explain
the good long-term organ preservation that was observed. Conducting confirmatory and comparative trials could
satisfy an unmet need but requires the multidisciplinary cooperation of urologists in selecting the right patients for a

Radical cystectomy remains the gold standard of treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer,1 with a 5-year local

control rate of 80% to 90% and 5-year overall survival rate of 40% to 60%.2-5 However, despite advances in surgical techniques such as nerve-sparing and orthotopic bladder construction, this major surgical technique has a considerable impact
on the patient’s quality of life. Furthermore, many patients refuse surgery or are considered unsuitable candidates because
of their age or comorbidities.
Bladder preservation has been proposed as an alternative approach in highly selected patients. The use of a trimodal
strategy that combines the possibility of controlling the disease locally by means of an organ-preserving transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) followed by external beam radiotherapy (XRT), with systemic chemotherapy theoretically
eradicating any micrometastases that may already be present at the time of initial diagnosis, has led to local control and
survival rates that are equivalent to those obtained with cystectomy,6-8 and has the quality-of-life advantage of leaving
patients with their own functioning bladder.
Several chemotherapeutic strategies have been used in an attempt to improve the outcomes of conservative
approaches. No significant benefit has been gained by administering neoadjuvant treatments before radiotherapy,9 and
therefore they are no longer routinely proposed, but some latest-generation drugs have more recently been administered

concomitantly with external irradiation because of their
radiosensitizing activity. Gemcitabine appears to be a
particularly promising radiosensitizing agent because it is
also active against advanced bladder cancer10 and acts
synergistically with cisplatin.
We published the results of what to our knowledge
was the first (dose-finding) study of gemcitabine administered with XRT and cisplatin in the context of a bladderconserving strategy in 200311 and, given the promising
local response rate, started to test the activity of the
schedule in a prospective phase 2 trial, which was prematurely closed because of the low accrual rate. In the
current study, we describe the long-term outcomes of the
patients enrolled in the 2 trials.

Study Designs
Dose-finding study

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Timelines
Our single-institution dose-finding study, which was
initiated in March 1999 and ended in July 2002 after the
enrolment of 16 patients, allowed us to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine administered
with XRT and cisplatin. The subsequent phase 2 trial was
planned as a multicenter trial involving another 9 Italian
hospitals, but these institutions enrolled only 1 patient;
we enrolled 9 patients but in December 2004 the policy
of the Urology Department was changed and radical
cystectomy was considered the only proposable treatment
for invasive bladder cancer. The trial was therefore
terminated after recruiting a total of 10 patients, but
herein we describe only the 9 patients enrolled by us.
Patient Selection
The patient selection criteria were the same for both studies. After the studies had been approved by the local Ethics
Committees of the participating hospitals, all patients
underwent cystoscopy and macroscopically complete
TURB. They all had a histological diagnosis of pT2 or
higher transitional bladder carcinoma without any physical or radiographic signs of metastatic disease. Before
treatment, all patients underwent a physical examination,
routine laboratory tests (including complete blood cell
counts and electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,
and glucose levels), liver function studies, abdominal
computed tomography (CT) scan, and a chest x-ray. The
inclusion criteria were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of at least 1, and
an adequate bone marrow reserve (defined as a pretreatment white blood cell count of 3000/lL, hemoglobin

The study protocol involved the delivery of 54 grays
(Gy) of fractionated XRT (1.8 Gy/fraction  30 fractions) over 6 weeks in combination with 6 weekly injections of gemcitabine plus cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2
given on Days 1 and 22. There were 4 gemcitabine dose
levels (from 200 to 500 mg & sold;m2/week, escalating by
100 mg/m2/week from 1 level to the next), and a minimum of 3 patients had to be treated at each dose level in
the absence of dose-limiting toxicities. If any dose-limiting toxicity occurred in 1 of these 3 patients, a minimum
of 3 additional patients were to be studied at the same
dose level. The MTD of gemcitabine was defined as the
dose associated with febrile neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 or 4 enteric toxicity, or grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity in 33% of the patients treated at that
dose level. XRT-related toxicities were assessed on using
the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria, and
chemotherapy-related toxicities were assessed using the
World Health Organization criteria.
Phase 2 study

On the basis of the results of the dose-finding study,
gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 400 mg/m2 on
Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 together with cisplatin at a dose of
100 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 22, and XRT was administered
in the same way as in the previous study.11
XRT
XRT was initiated within 6 weeks of complete TURB.
During the first 4 weeks of XRT, a fractionated dose of
36 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction  20 fractions) was administered
to the small pelvis (from S1 to the obturator foramen)
using a 4-field box, 3-dimensional conformal technique;
the clinical target volume included the bladder and pelvic

1191

lymphatics. During the fifth and sixth weeks, the clinical
target volume included only the initial tumor volume,
with the use of reduced-box or opposed lateral
or anteroposterior fields. The patients were treated in a
supine position with an empty bladder. Treatment was
planned using a CT scan made in the treatment position,
with a 1.5-cm margin being added to the clinical target
volume to allow for geometric uncertainties (planning
target volume). XRT was delivered using 15-megaelectron
volt beams of a linear accelerator. The XRT modalities
were the same in the dose-finding study and the phase
2 trial.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy was initiated on the first day of XRT. Cisplatin was given at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 22.
Gemcitabine was administered intravenously at the previously described doses on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 (in
the dose-finding study) or on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 (in the
phase 2 trial) during the hour preceding XRT (except for
Days 1 and 22, when it was given before cisplatin). No
additional doses were given after Day 36 if any doses had
been withheld during the planned course of treatment.
No dose modification was planned if neutrophil
counts were 1500/lL and/or platelet counts were
100,000/lL. If the neutrophil counts were between
1000 and 1500/lL, the drugs were administered at full
doses with 2 subcutaneous doses of granulocyte–colonystimulating factor (5 lg/kg/day) being administered
3 days after treatment; in the case of lower neutrophil
counts, this treatment was omitted. Dose reductions of
75% for gemcitabine and 50% for cisplatin were planned
if platelet levels were between 75,000/lL and 99,000/lL,
and a week’s rest was planned if these levels were
<75,000/lL. In the case of increased creatinine levels, the
treatment was stopped until forced intravenous hydration
had returned them to normal values.
Evaluations During Therapy
Routine laboratory tests (complete blood counts with
differential, electrolytes, glucose, and renal and hepatic
function) were performed weekly during therapy. The
patients were clinically assessed each week by medical
oncologists and radiotherapists in a multidisciplinary
setting. Any decision to reduce the dose, withhold
therapy, or proceed on schedule was made on the basis of
the patient’s clinical status and a review of the laboratory
results.

1192

Post-Treatment Evaluations
Six to 8 weeks after completing the concomitant radiochemotherapy, the patients underwent a cystoscopic reevaluation with multiple biopsies of the initial tumor site.
No further treatment was planned for patients who were
free of tumor, whereas those with noninvasive and welldifferentiated superficial tumors were to be treated
conservatively by means of TURB plus intravesical
chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The patients with
deeply infiltrating or poorly differentiated residual tumors
underwent cystectomy, unless major surgery was contraindicated or there were progressive distant metastases. All
the patients also underwent abdominal CT scans and a
chest x-ray. The follow-up procedures for local disease
control assessment in all of the patients who were tumor
free was comprised of alternating urinary cytology and
cystoscopy every 3 months for the first 3 years, and every
6 months from the fourth year onward. In the case of local
(invasive or noninvasive) disease recurrence, the proposed
treatment was the same as that described earlier. The
patients underwent abdominal CT scans and a chest x-ray
every 6 months for the first 3 years, and yearly thereafter.
Statistical Analysis
Actuarial survival probabilities were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method12 and the following definitions.
Overall survival

For overall survival (OS), events were defined
as death because of any cause. The time to OS was the
interval between treatment initiation and death, or the
most recent follow-up if no event occurred.
Disease-specific survival

For disease-specific survival (DSS), events were
defined as death attributable to bladder cancer. The time
to DSS was the interval between treatment initiation and
death because of bladder cancer, or the most recent
follow-up if no event occurred.
Bladder-intact survival

For bladder-intact survival (BIS), events were defined
as cystectomy for any reason or death because of any cause.
The time to BIS was the interval between treatment initiation and cystectomy or death (whichever was shorter), or
the most recent follow-up if no event occurred.
Local disease-free survival

For local disease-free survival (lDFS), events were
defined as any recurrence of superficial or infiltrating

bladder cancer. The time to lDFS was the interval
between treatment initiation and the first bladder failure,
or the most recent follow-up if no event occurred.

Table 1. Long-Term Clinical Outcomes

Current Study

Distant disease-free survival

For distant disease-free survival, events were defined
as distant failure (ie, metastases). The time to dDFS was
the interval between treatment initiation and the occurrence of distant metastases, or the most recent follow-up if
no event occurred.
Event-free survival

For event-free survival (EFS), events were defined as
any failure, death because of any cause, or cystectomy.
The time to EFS was the interval between treatment
initiation and the first failure, death, or cystectomy
(whichever was shortest), or the most recent follow-up if
no event occurred.

bowel toxicity). There was no case of radiotherapy being
discontinued because of toxicity; chemotherapy was
delayed in 2 cases because of hematological toxicity.
Late Toxicities
No relevant toxicities were observed during the follow-up
period. The treatment did not produce any relevant late
urinary or rectal toxicity in the patients who retained their
bladder: only transient grade 1 to 2 irritative urinary
symptoms were observed in the 6 months after the end of
XRT. All these patients were still alive without cystectomy
at the time of last follow-up, and retained their own bladder with normal organ function. The urologists did not
encounter any relevant technical problems during surgery
in the patients who underwent salvage radical cystectomy.

Dose-finding study

The weekly gemcitabine administration was generally well tolerated and was associated with manageable
toxicity up to the dose of 500 mg/m2, at which time 1
intestinal perforation (favorably treated surgically) was
observed 2 weeks after the end of treatment, as was 1 death
because of untreated diarrhea appearing on treatment
Day 30 and not reported by the patient. The major
toxicities at the lower dose levels were hematological and
usually occurred on Days 15 and 36.
These toxicities led to the schedule proposed in the
phase 2 trial, with the gemcitabine MTD being defined as
400 mg/m2 and doses on Days 15 and 36 being omitted.
A more detailed description of the acute toxicities
observed during the dose-finding study has been published elsewhere.11

During radiochemotherapy, the toxicities were
manageable because there were only 2 cases of grade 3
neutropenia. Local toxicity was mild (grade 2 urinary and

Clinical Outcomes
Fifteen patients in the dose-finding study (1 died during
treatment) and all 9 in the phase 2 trial were evaluable for
response; none experienced rapid disease progression
before the completion of the treatment. All the evaluable
patients were disease free at the time of the cystoscopic reevaluation, and the macroscopic absence of visible lesions
was confirmed by biopsies obtained at the site of the
primary tumors (a response rate of 100%). Post-treatment
CT scans did not reveal the appearance of any distant
metastases (Table 1).
After a median follow-up of 74 months (range, 13124 months), 4 patients had developed an infiltrating
bladder disease recurrence after 5 months to 13 months
(median, 7.5 months). Salvage surgery was not proposed
in 1 case because of a concomitant extravesical pelvic
recurrence. Cystectomy was performed in 2 cases; the
remaining patient refused surgery and died of causes
unrelated to cancer 23 months after the completion of
treatment. An additional 4 patients developed non-

infiltrating tumors: 1 was managed with intravesical
therapy and 2 underwent cystectomy; the fourth patient
refused any further treatment or disease re-evaluation and
remained asymptomatic and in good health after 113
months. Four patients developed distant metastases after a
median of 13.5 months (range, 10 months-80 months).
The projected 5-year clinical outcomes are an OS
rate of 70.1%, a DSS rate of 78.9%, a BIS rate of 73.8%,
an lDFS rate of 65%, a dDFS rate of 87.5%, and an EFS
rate of 53.6%. In the case of the 12 patients treated at the

rate of 73.3%, a DSS rate of 82.5%, a BIS rate of 80.2%,
an lDFS rate of 72.9%, a dDFS rate of 91.7%; and an
EFS rate of 56%.

DISCUSSION
The long-term outcomes described in the current study
confirm that the addition of gemcitabine to concomitant
cisplatin and XRT leads to good disease control in
patients with infiltrating bladder cancer.
Gemcitabine is a multitarget antifolate drug whose
characteristics make it the drug of choice in the context of
a multidisciplinary clinical strategy aimed at sparing the
bladder in patients with transitional infiltrating cancer. It
synergistically acts with cisplatin, something that reportedly led to good results in the treatment of non-small cell
lung cancer, for which this combination is reportedly one
of the most active therapies for patients with advanced
disease.13 It is active against bladder cancer,10 and has
radiosensitizing activity.14
Our group first reported the feasibility of adding
gemcitabine to XRT after TURB in 2003, and other subsequently published studies have confirmed our findings
(Table 2).11,15,16 However, our MTD findings were quite
different from those of the other studies in that we
observed manageable toxicities requiring only the omis-

1194

sion of some drug doses (usually in the third week) in all
of our patients who received the MTD or less (the dose
recommended by us was 400 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8
every 3 weeks), but the other studies recommended much
lower doses, ranging from 27 mg/m2 twice a week15 to
150 mg/m2 weekly.16 This clear contrast most likely
reflected some differences in terms of treatment (XRT
technique) and study design (the definition of dose-limiting toxicity).
Another significant difference was the therapeutic
strategy adopted in the different trials. The other groups
evaluated gemcitabine alone as a radiosensitizer and
avoided the use of cisplatin during XRT, whereas we
added gemcitabine into one of the most widely used
radiochemotherapy schemes for the conservative management of patients with infiltrating bladder cancer, with
cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 being given at the same
time as XRT. Obviously, this raises the question of the
role of cisplatin and its true usefulness in disease control.
All 3 dose-finding studies reported interesting
response rates, with the post-treatment complete remission rate ranging from 87.5%16 to 100%.11 Given the
dose-finding nature of the studies and their consequently
small study populations, these results need to be considered cautiously. However, the availability of data concerning the long-term clinical outcomes of the patients
enrolled in dose-finding trials may help. The University
of Michigan group recently updated its findings after a
median follow-up of 67 months,17 and comparison of
time-dependent clinical outcomes (Table 1) indicated
quite similar results. The only major difference appeared
to be with regard to the projected 5-year BIS rate, which
was reported as 62% in the study by Oh et al and 73.8%
in ours. This is even more evident in the subsequent time
interval, with survival in the US study falling to 0 after
8 years, but remaining at 60.6% for 10 years in ours
(Fig. 1).

long-term functional results, and the concomitant administration of cisplatin may explain the good rate of longterm organ preservation. Conducting confirmatory and
comparative trials could satisfy an unmet need but
requires the multidisciplinary cooperation of urologists in
selecting the right patients for a bladder-sparing strategy.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
The authors made no disclosures.

Figure 1. Bladder-intact survival is shown.

Once again, the small number of patients does not
allow any definite conclusions to be drawn, but the difference suggests that the addition of cisplatin may have
offered some advantage. Furthermore, the data from the
current study cannot support the addition of both cisplatin and gemcitabine to XRT as being superior compared
with cisplatin alone. These problems may be clarified only
by formal comparative studies aimed at establishing
whether XRT should to combined with cisplatin alone,
gemcitabine alone, or both drugs.
However, the difficulties we experienced when
enrolling patients for our phase 2 trial suggest that such
studies may never be completed and highlight the cooperation of urologists as the main limitation. From a urologist’s point of view, a bladder-sparing strategy should be
restricted to patients at high surgical risk, with cystectomy
being the only truly life-sparing therapy in the other
patients. Nevertheless, the discouraging long-term survival data of a large series of patients treated surgically2-5
or radiochemotherapeutically6-8 clearly indicate that
patients are the only losers in this battle for therapeutic
supremacy. We strongly believe that cystectomy is the
treatment of choice of patients with infiltrating bladder
cancer, but also that conservative multimodal TURB,
XRT, and CT management should be offered to highly
selected patients because it has a clear physiological and
psychological advantage that cannot be reduced by new
bladder-removing surgical techniques.
In conclusion, our long-term follow-up data concerning a series of patients participating in 2 prospective
trials confirm that the addition of gemcitabine to XRT
and cisplatin after TURB is safe and provides good local
and distant disease control. The relatively low XRT dose
used in our multimodal experience may explain the good
