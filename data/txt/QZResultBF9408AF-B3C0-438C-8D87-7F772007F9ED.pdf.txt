ABSTRACT
Combination therapy has a higher success rate for many cancers compared to
mono-therapy. The treatment of Topotecan (TPT) on gastric cancer (GC) is limited by
its toxicity and the potential drug resistance. We found that the combination of the
saponin monomer 13 from the dwarf lilyturf tuber (DT-13), performing anti-metastasis
and anti-angiogenesis effects, with TPT synergistically induced apoptotic cytotoxicity in
GCs with high EGF receptor (EGFR) expression, which was dependent on DT-13-induced
endocytosis of EGFR. With TPT, DT-13 promoted EGFR ubiquitin--mediated degradation
through myosin IIA-induced and Src/ caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-induced endocytosis of
EGFR; inhibited EGFR downstream signalling and then increased the pro-apoptotic
effects. Moreover, the synergistic pro-apoptotic efficacy of DT-13 and TPT in GCs with
high EGFR expression was eliminated by both the NM II inhibitor (-)-blebbistatin and
MYH-9 shRNA. The combination therapy of DT-13 with TPT showed stronger antitumour effects in vivo compared with their individual effects. Moreover, the results of
combination therapy revealed selective upregulation of pro-apoptotic activity in TUNEL
assays and cleaved caspase-3 and NM IIA in immunohischemical analysis; while specific
downregulation of p-extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), EGFR and Cav-1

implications for patients with tumours harbouring high EGFR expression due to the
possible high sensitivity of this regimen.

low five-year survival rate. Recently, an increasing number
of GC targets have been found, including EGFR, HER2
and VEGF [2]; several studies have demonstrated that the
high expression of EGFR in GC has a close relationship
with its occurrence, development and biological behaviour
[3]. Moreover, Aichler M et al. reported that high EGFR
expression induced chemoresistance and was correlated
with a poor prognosis in the clinic [4, 5].

which is a semi-synthetic analogue of the new Topoinhibitor camptothecin, has been licensed as an anti-cancer
agent for small cell lung cancer [6] and ovarian cancer [7].
DT-13, a saponin of the dwarf lilyturf tuber Ophiopogon
japonicus wall (Family: Convallariaceae), possesses
anticancer activities against various types of cancers [8]
and anti-angiogenesis activity [9] on multiple targets, such
as Egr-1, VEGF, CCR-5, Hif-1α and MMP2/9 [10–12]. In
a recent study research, DT-13 attenuated tumour necrosis
factor-α-induced vascular inflammation that was associated
with Src/NF-кB/MAPK pathway modulation [13]. Using
column chromatography, we have verified that NM IIA
was the specific target of DT-13. We have found TPT
downregulated the expression of NM IIA, which would
attenuate the effectiveness of the TPT therapy. As taking
the advantage of combination therapies (i.e., avoiding
the risk of the development of resistance, increasing the
effectiveness of the therapy, and the effectiveness of clinical
combination therapies with TPT), we designed DT-13
combined with TPT, to increase the expression of NM IIA
and increase the effectiveness of TPT therapy for GCs.
NM II is an ATP-driven molecular motor that plays
diverse roles in cell physiology. Through crosslinking and
translocation of actin filaments by utilizing energy from
ATP hydrolysis, NM II can inhibit cellular reshaping
and movement and consequently depress cell migration,
adhesion, polarity, and cytokinesis [14–16]. NM II is a
hexamer composed of two pairs of light chains (20 kDa
and 17 kDa) [17] and distinct heavy chain (II-A, II-B, or
II-C) along with three prominent genes (MYH-9, MYH10 and MYH-14) that encode the NMHC (non-muscle
myosin heavy chain; 230 kDa) proteins [18]. NM IIA
has the highest rate of ATP hydrolysis of the three NM
II isoforms and propels actin filaments more rapidly than
NM IIB and NM IIC [14, 19]. The different enzymatic and
motor activities of the NM IIs reside in their N-terminal
domain, while the C-terminal rod and non-helical tail
determine the assembly of myosin filaments and the
intracellular localization of the NM II isoforms [20].
Kim JH et al. reported that NM II was required for
the endocytosis of EGFR and the modulation of the EGFRdependent activation of downstream signals, including
ERK1/2 and Akt [21]. Based on these findings, we developed
the hypothesis that DT-13 might be able to correlate to
NM II and synergistically combine with TPT to inhibit the
high EGFR expression GCs through increasing NM IIA
modulation of EGFR endocytosis and downstream signalling.

the inhibitory effect of DT-13 combined with TPT on the
survival of GCs with different EGFR expression levels,
such as: BGC-823 (high expression), SGC-7901 (high
expression), and HGC-27 (low expression) cell lines (the
EGFR level data were shown in Supplementary Figures
S1A, S1B). After 72 h treatment, DT-13 combined with
TPT exhibited a synergistic inhibitory effect on the
survival of GCs with high EGFR expression (BGC-823
and SGC-7901) compared with TPT treatment alone. In
contrast, no synergistic effect was observed in HGC-27
cells (Figure 1A). Moreover, the combined treatment
changed the morphology of the high EGFR-expressing
cells (Supplementary Figure S1C). These results indicated
that DT-13 combined with TPT exerted a synergistic
inhibitory effect on cell survival only in GCs with high
EGFR expression.

DT-13 combined with TPT promoted proapoptotic activity in BGC-823 cells
To investigate the mechanism of the combined
treatment on the survival of the high EGFR-expressing
GCs, we measured the effect of the combined treatment on
pro-apoptotic activity. As shown, a stronger pro-apoptotic
activity was observed in the combination treatment groups
after 48 h of treatment compared with the single drug
treatment groups (Figures 1B, 1C, Supplementary Figure
S2A and Supplementary Figure S2B). A change in the
nuclei was also observed after the combination treatment
(Supplementary Figure S1D). In contrast, the combination
treatment didn’t exert pro-apoptotic activity in HGC-27
cells (low EGFR expression) (Figures 1D, 1E).
Mitochondria release caspase-activating proteins
into the cytosol, thereby forming the apoptosome where
caspases bind and become activated [23]. To confirm
the pro-apoptotic effect of the combination treatment,
we measured the ΔΨm in the cells via JC-1 staining
and flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figures 1F
and Supplementary Figure S2C, the proportion of cells
emitting green fluorescence (apoptosis) in the combination
group was significantly higher compared to the single-drug
groups. We also measured the levels of proteins involved
in the apoptosis pathway. The combination treatment
increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved
caspase-9, cleaved PARP, and Bax and reduced the
expression of Bcl-2, ongoing induce apoptosis in the high
EGFR-expressing GCs (Figures 1G, Supplementary Figure
S2D). These findings clearly showed the mitochondria
mediated apoptosis in GCs following treatment with the
combination of DT-13 and TPT.

combination treatment on the EGFR pathway. In BGC823 and SGC-7901 cells, the combination treatment not
only reduced the p-EGFR level but also reduced total
EGFR expression (Figures 2A, Supplementary Figure
S2E). To confirm the regulation of the combination
treatment on the EGFR pathway, we measured the
downstream events of EGFR. The combination treatment
exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK1/2 pathway and PI3K level than TPT or DT-13
alone in BGC-823 (Figure 2B) and SGC-7901 cells
(Supplementary Figure S2G). In previous studies, the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K signalling cascades
were shown to play critical roles in the transmission of

signals from growth factor receptors to regulate gene
expression and prevent apoptosis [24, 25]. Our findings
indicate that the combined effect of DT-13 and TPT
leads to GC apoptosis via EGFR and its downstream
signalling.
Moreover, the combination treatment decreased
not only EGFR expression but also EGFR distribution
on cell plasm membrane. In the BGC-823 and SGC-7901
combination treatment group, we observed a significant
decrease in the fluorescence intensity of EGFR both in
throughout the cells and on the plasma membrane (Figures
2C, Supplementary Figure S3A). This result indicated that
DT-13 combined with TPT exerts a pro-apoptotic activity
via depressing EGFR and its downstream signalling.

DT-13 promoted the degradation of EGFR
through the induction of EGFR endocytosis by
myosin IIA

Kim JH et al. reported that NM II was required
for the endocytosis of EGFR [21]. Therefore, we
focused on the potential relationship between EGFR
and NM II in GCs after DT-13 treatment. Using column
chromatography, we confirmed the affinity of DT-13
for NM IIA based on specific binding (data not shown).
To reconfirm these findings for both drugs individually,
we examined the effects of DT-13 and TPT alone or
combination treatment on NM IIA. We found that the
expression of NM IIA was increased by DT-13, whereas
TPT suppressed the expression of NM IIA in BGC-823
(Figure 3C) and SGC-7901 cells (Supplementary Figure
S3D). The combination treatment increased the NM IIA
protein level in both cell lines (Figures 3D, Supplementary
Figure S3E); the NM IIA mRNA level exhibited a same
trend (Figures 3B, Supplementary Figure S3C).
The fluorescence intensity of NM IIA in BGC823 and SGC-7901 cells was significantly increased in
the combined group (Figures 3E, Supplementary Figure
S4A); however, NM IIA distribution was not changed by
the DT-13 single or combination treatment. To investigate
a potential role for NM IIA in EGFR degradation, we

The combination treatment reduced total and
phosphorylated EGFR. However, it is not clear which
drug (or both) owns that function. Thus, we measured
the effect of DT-13 and TPT separately on EGFR and
p-EGFR in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells. As shown in
Figures 3A and Supplementary Figure S3B, a decrease in
the expression of EGFR and p-EGFR was observed after
the GCs were treated with DT-13 for 48 h; moreover,
the reduction of EGFR was greater than the reduction of
p-EGFR. Similarly, the expression of EGFR and p-EGFR
was significantly increased after treatment of the GCs
with TPT alone for 48 h. This result indicates that DT-13
may reduce p-EGFR via down-regulating the EGFR level.
However, the EGFR mRNA level was not reduced after
solo treatment with DT-13 (Figures 3B, Supplementary
Figure S3C). Our findings indicated that DT-13 downregulated the EGFR protein level via degradation of EGFR
but not via regulating of the EGFR mRNA level.

measured the distribution of both NM IIA and EGFR after
treatment. In the immunofluorescence analysis, DT-13
(alone or combination) not only decreased the fluorescence
intensity of EGFR and increased NM IIA expression but
also induced the colocalization of EGFR and NM IIA in
the cells based on fluorescence intensity analysis by Image
J (Figures 3F, Supplementary Figure S4B). However, the
DT-13 alone and combination treatments did not change
the distribution of NM IIA and EGFR in HGC-27 GCs
(Supplementary Figure S4C). To confirm these results, we
used the co-immunoprecipitation assay to determine the
relationship between EGFR and NM IIA in the cytoplasm.
The results showed that the EGFR protein level in the
cytoplasm was increased by DT-13; the level of NM IIA
binding with EGFR was also increased by DT-13 (Figures
3G, Supplementary Figure S4D). These data supported the
hypothesis that DT-13 had the ability to promote EGFR
degradation through myosin IIA-induced endocytosis of
EGFR.
To verify whether the expression of EGFR
protein was decreased due to ubiquitin-triggered protein
degradation, we pre-treated GCs with the proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 for 2 h and then treated cells with
DT-13 for 48 h. MG-132 significantly reversed the
effect of DT-13 (alone or combination) on the EGFR
protein reducing 48 h after DT-13 treatment (Figures 4A,
Supplementary Figure S4E). Next, to examine whether
the degradation of EGFR protein was correlated to NM
IIA, we pre-treated the GCs with the NM II inhibitor
(-)-blebbistatin or knocked down NM IIA. We found that
both (-)-blebbistatin treatment and NM IIA knock-down
reversed the effect of DT-13 (alone or combination) on
the EGFR protein reducing (Figures 4B, Supplementary
Figure S4F); indeed, the EGFR protein and mRNA levels
were increased after NM IIA knock down (Figures 4C,
Supplementary Figure S4G). There was no significant
change observed on the mRNA levels of NM IIB and NM
IIC (Supplementary Figure S4H). These findings showed
that DT-13 promoted EGFR degradation through myosin
IIA-induced endocytosis of EGFR.

that DT-13 induced the endocytosis of EGFR via the upregulation NM IIA, thereby resulting in GC apoptosis.

Combinational pro-apoptotic effect was
promoted by NM IIA
The above data showed that DT-13 combined
with TPT had a stronger effect on GC inhibition and
the induction of GC apoptosis (Figures 1B, 1E and 1F)
compared with DT-13 or TPT single treatment. Moreover,
our data showed that NM IIA was an important target
of the induction of apoptosis in GCs with high EGFR
expression by DT-13. Therefore, we focused on whether
NM IIA was also a crucial target of the combination
treatment. NM IIA knocking down and (-)-Blebbistatin can
both reversed the apoptosis induced by the combination
treatment (Figures 4D, Supplementary Figure S5C and
4E). Moreover, the level of cleaved PARP induced by the
combination treatment was reduced by NM IIA knock
down and (-)-blebbistatin, with the NM IIA knock down
nearly eliminating all of the cleaved PARP in GCs treated
with the combination treatment (Figures 5F, 5G, S5A and
S5B). The data indicated that the effect of the combination
treatment on GC apoptosis depended on the function of
NM IIA in GCs with high EGFR expression.
To confirm the role of NM IIA in cells administered
the combination treatment, we determined the effect
of TPT on the EGFR pathway. The western blot results
showed that TPT reduced NM IIA expression (Figure
3C) and increased EGFR expression (Figure 3A). Similar
results were observed in the immunofluorescence analysis
(Figures 3E, 2C). However, when TPT was combined with
DT-13, the effect of TPT on NM IIA/EGFR was reversed
by DT-13 (Figures 3D, 2A).
To confirm the effect of the combination treatment
on the EGFR pathway, we determined the effect of the
combination treatment on the apoptosis of HGC-27 cells
transfected with the EGFR wild-type plasmid. The above
data showed that DT-13-TPT combination did not exert
a synergistic effect in HGC-27 cells with the low level
of EGFR expression. However, when HGC-27 cells were
transfected with the EGFR WT plasmid (Supplementary
Figure S5D) or treated with EGF or TGF-α to up-regulate
EGFR expression (Supplementary Figure S5E), the
proportion of cells undergoing early apoptosis in DT13-TPT combination treatment group was increased and
the cleaved PARP protein level was up-regulated (Figure
5A). Similarly, when BGC-823 cells with higher EGFR
expression were pre-treated with 10 μM MEK inhibitor
(U0126) or 10 μM PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) for 2 h
before treatment with DT-13-TPT combination, the effect
of DT-13-TPT combination on pro-apoptotic activity was
inhibited (Figure 5B). We also found EGFR depletion
using siRNA or EGFR inhibitor (Erlotinib) exhibit similar
effect in combined with TPT (Supplementary Figure S6A,
S6B, S6C, S6D), but the ability of both in increasing the

DT-13 increased NM IIA to contribute to the
pro-apoptotic effect
Because EGFR was correlated to the pro-apoptotic
effect, we investigated whether NM IIA was involved in
the induction of apoptosis by DT-13. After NM IIA knock
down, the effect of DT-13 (alone or combination) on
proportion of early apoptosis was significantly reduced.
Moreover, cleaved PARP was reduced by the NM IIA
knock down when GCs (BGC-823 and SGC-7901) were
treated with DT-13 (Figures 4D, 4F, Supplementary Figure
S5A and Supplementary Figure S5C). Similar to NM IIA
knock down, (-)-Blebbistatin also induced the reversal of
early apoptosis and cleaved PARP level (Figures 4E, 4G
and Supplementary Figure S5B). These data confirmed

pathway, which was consistent with the in vitro data.

Effect of DT-13 combined with TPT on Src/
Cav-1

Combination treatments are frequently used to
treat different cancers to increase the curative effect and
avoid high doses and toxic side effects; combination
therapy may also help to avoid the development of drug
resistance. Therefore, the development of a reasonable
and efficient combination strategy for the effective
chemotherapy of tumours is of great significance.
Combining different agents can be more effective
(additive or synergistic), because multiple pathways can
be targeted [33, 34]. However, previous studies have
suggested that the benefits of combination treatment
are selective and that only specific subcategories of
cancers are exceptionally sensitive. Okabe T et al.
demonstrated that the synergistic effects of gefitinib and
5-fluorouracil combined treatment was only observed in
EGFR mutant (exon 19 deletion) NSCLC cell lines with
MET amplification but not in cell lines with an additional
EGFR T790M mutation [35]. According to these
observations, it is likely that specific drug combinations
are mostly effective against a specific phenotypic and
genotypic subcategory of cancer.
In this study, we observed that BGC-823 and
SGC-7901 cells (with higher EGFR levels) responded
best to low dose DT-13-TPT combination treatment.
In contrast, HGC-27 cells (with lower EGFR levels)
treated with DT-13-TPT combination showed minimal
cell apoptosis. When HGC-27 cells were induced to
overexpress EGFR, the proportion of cells in early
apoptosis following DT-13-TPT combination treatment
was increased and the cleaved PARP protein level was
upregulated. These findings led us to conclude that
EGFR signalling axis plays a key role in sensitizing
GCs with high EGFR expression to low dose DT-13TPT combination treatment. Compelling evidence
indicated that the downstream signalling molecules
and pathways, B-Raf and C-Raf, which is activated
by forming heterodimer in physiological progression.
Additionally, the specific inhibitor of B-Raf could
activate C-Raf and it regulated signalling, in a
B-Raf independent manner [36], suggesting that the
downstream signalling pathway activities is inhibited on
the condition that completely inhibiting the activation
of formed heterodimer [37]. In our observation, the
TPT mono-therapy sufficiently reduced the B-Raf level
but not C-Raf (Figures 2B, S2F, S2G), which results
in partial downregulation on MEK/ERK signalling;
while the TPT and DT-13 comb-therapy significantly
decreased both B-Raf and C-Raf to markedly depress
the MEK/ERK signalling, eventually promoted the proapoptotic activity more efficiency compared with TPT
or DT-13 mono-therapy.

DISCUSSION

Various receptor and non-receptor kinases such as
the EGFR are localized in the Caveolae. Cav-1 binds to
EGFR and activates multiple signalling networks [26–
28]. Peculiar Src expression and kinase activity have
been found in a number of different tumours, including
GCs; these changes in expression could upregulate
tyrosine phosphorylation of Cav-1 [29, 30] and inhibit
the effects of the cell membrane on EGFR endocytosis
[31]. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated that Src
kinase activity may activate EGFR activity [32]. Cav-1
and p-Cav-1(Y14) were reduced when BGC-823 cells
were treated with DT-13; however, the TPT-treated group
had the opposite result (Figure 5C). When DT-13 was
combined with TPT, the increased p-Cav-1(Y14) level
was reduced (Figure 5D). Using immunofluorescence, we
determined that the fluorescence intensity of Cav-1 was
faded in the combination group (Figure 5E). Furthermore,
DT-13 inhibited Tyr527 dephosphorylation and Tyr416
phosphorylation and downregulated Src activity;
TPT up-regulated Src activity via promoting Tyr527
dephosphorylation and Tyr416 phosphorylation (Figure
5F). These results suggested that DT-13 could accelerate
the endocytosis of EGFR through the down-regulation of
Src activity, thereby reducing the level of p-Cav-1(Y14).
When DT-13 was combined with TPT, DT-13 could
eliminate the side effects of TPT.

Combination treatment and inhibition of tumour
growth in BGC-823-xenografted nude mice
DT-13 combined with TPT was not only effective
in vitro but also acted as an effective anti-cancer
regimen in vivo. We evaluated the effect of DT-13TPT combination in vivo using an established BGC823 cell xenograft model. As shown in Figures 6A and
6B, 1.25 mg/kg DT-13 combined with 0.5 mg/kg TPT
exerted a significant synergistic inhibitory effect on
BGC-823 xenografts. In tumour tissues from the BGC823-xenografted nude mice treated with DT-13-TPT
combination, the positive areas for TUNEL, cleaved
caspase-3 and NM IIA were increased, while the positive
areas for p-ERK1/2, EGFR and Cav-1 were reduced
(Figures 6D, 6E). Additionally, more EGFR appeared
in the cytoplasm in cells from DT-13-TPT combinationtreated group; the protein levels of cleaved PARP and
p-ERK1/2 were increased in DT-13-TPT combinationtreated group (Figure 6C). These results showed that
DT-13 combined with TPT boosted the pro-apoptotic

This study described the use of DT-13-TPT
combination to induce pro-apoptotic effect and killing
cancer cells. We found that the addition of DT-13 with
TPT in BGC-823 cells reduced the IC50 50-fold as TPT.
Upon further investigation, we found two ways by which
DT-13 might expedite EGFR endocytosis and hinder its
key role in the initiation of signalling response. First,
DT-13 had the ability to increase NM IIA expression

and might promote NM IIA binding to EGFR, thereby
expediting the endocytosis of EGFR as described in
previous studies [21]. Second, DT-13 was involved
in the promotion of the endocytosis of EGFR through
the down-regulation of Src protein activity, leading to
the suppression of p-Cav-1 (Y14) and the enhanced
endocytosis ability of Caveolae for EGFR [26, 38, 39]
(Figure 7).

Figure 7: A schematic representation of a hypothesized mechanism of the synergistic combination of DT-13 and TPT
inhibits human gastric cancer via myosin IIA-induced endocytosis of EGFR.
Ligand-induced endocytosis of EGFR is
an important process for the regulation of signal
transduction, cellular dynamics, and cell-cell
communication. Caveolae is a raft-like structure that
belongs to the route of endocytosis of EGFR doesn’t
depend on the clathrin pathway, which was characterized
by its insensitivity to the functional ablation of clathrin,
a fact that led to its rather non-descriptive definition
of non-clathrin endocytosis (NCE) [40–42]. The
requirement of NM IIA for EGFR endocytosis was
first reported by Kim JH.et al [21] and wasn’t further
explored in depth until now. We are the first to report that
the degradation of EGFR is induced by NM IIA, causing
EGFR endocytosis. Despite the importance of EGFR in
GC development in the clinic [43], the binding of NM
IIA and EGFR had not been applied to drug research.
Our present study verified the interaction of NM II with
EGFR and indicated that this novel mechanism was a
target for combination drugs; this is a novel aspect of our
findings that has not been previously reported.
NM IIA has been reported to regulate cell migration,
adhesion, polarity, and cytokinesis [14–16]; however,
the correlation between NM IIA and cell apoptosis has
not been reported previously. Our findings highlight
for the first time this correlation of NM IIA with cancer
cell apoptosis by using the NM II inhibitor and MYH-9
shRNA. These findings showed that the percentage of GCs
in early apoptosis was reduced when NM IIA was blocked
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or the activity of NM IIA was inhibited; we also postulated
that the NM IIA mediated EGFR degradation process is
related to the expression level of EGFR. For instance, the
NM IIA mediated EGFR degradation process was only
activated when EGFR expression reached a threshold, or
conversely. In this research, DT-13 monotherapy increased
the activation of NM IIA but fail to activate the NM IIA
mediated EGFR degradation process due the expression
of EGFR is below the threshold; however, Our research
group will be investigating the whole picture of the
contextual pathways between the NM IIA mediated EGFR
degradation process and EGFR expression level, and these
findings may need to be explored in depth to evaluate the
relevancy of EGFR expression and the effects of DT-13 on
the NM IIA promoter regions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and plasmids
Human gastric cancer (BGC-823, SGC-7901, HGC27, NCI-N87 and MGC-803) cells and embryonic kidney
293T cells were purchased from The Shanghai Institute
of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. BGC823 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and antibiotics (100 units/ml
penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin). 293T cells were
cultured in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS and antibiotics
33000

Western blot analysis

(100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin).
Other cells were grown in RMPI-1640 with 10% FBS
and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin). The cells were incubated in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C. The MYH-9 lentivirus
shRNA was purchased from Shanghai GenePharma
Co., Ltd. The EGFR plasmid was obtained from Beijing
Zhongyuan Ltd. Cell transfection and plasmid construction
are described in the Supplementary Methods.

After treatment 48 h, cellular proteins were extracted
and Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described [9]. All primary antibodies were purchased
from Cell Signalling Technology, Inc (Cell Signaling
Technology). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antimouse immunoglobulin G (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin G (Cell Signaling Technology) were used as
the secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using
enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Millipore).

Cell growth inhibition assay

Quantitative real-time PCR

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates in 180 μL
of medium and incubated for 12 h. Then, the cells were
cultured in the presence of DT-13 and TPT alone or in
combination for 72 h. Afterwards, 5 mg/mL of MTT
solution (20 μL/well) was added and the cells were
cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 4 h; then, the
supernatant was discarded and DMSO was added (150 μL/
well). The suspension was placed on a micro-vibrator for 5
min, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a
Universal Microplate Reader (EL800; Bio-tek Instruments
Inc.). The experiments were performed in triplicate in a
parallel manner for each concentration, and the results
are presented as the mean ± SD. The inhibitory ratio
was calculated by the following formula: inhibitory ratio
(%) = (1–average absorbance of treated group/average
absorbance of control group) × 100.

Total cellular RNA was isolated with the TRIzol®
Reagent (Vazyme) and reverse transcribed with the
RevertAidTM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara).
The mRNA level was measured with the SYBR Green
master mix (Vazyme). The amount of mRNA for each
gene was standardized with the internal control (18s
mRNA). Each treatment group was compared with the
control group to show the relative mRNA level. The
primer sequences for quantitative RT-PCR are provided in
Supplementary Table S1.

In vivo tumorigenicity
Female athymic BALB/c nude mice (5–6 weeks old)
with body masses ranging from 18 to 22 g were supplied
by the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese
Academy of Sciences. For subcutaneous (S.C) injection
of gastric cancer cells, sub-confluent BGC-823 cells were
collected in serum-free medium (106 cells/100 μL). Then,
the cell suspension was injected subcutaneously into mice
in one flank (n= 6). All assays were repeated at least three
times. Animal care and surgery protocols were approved
by the Animal Care Committee of China Pharmaceutical
University. All animals were treated appropriately and
used in a scientifically valid and ethical manner.

Annexin V/PI double staining
After treatment 48 h, apoptotic cells were identified
by the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (BD
Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. Flow cytometric analysis was performed
immediately after supravital staining. Data acquisition and
analysis were performed in a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer using the Cell Quest software
(Franklin Lakes).

Immunohistochemical analysis

Detection of changes in mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm) by JC-1

Immunohistochemical analysis for apoptosis,
cleaved-caspase 3, and p-ERK, Cav-1, EGFR and NM IIA
in tumor tissues are described in Supplementary Methods.

Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was
evaluated using JC-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) staining
and flow cytometry analysis. BGC-823 and SGC-7901
cells were treated with 10 μM DT-13 with or without
various concentrations of TPT for 48 h. JC-1 detection
was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Statistical analysis
All of the results were presented as the mean ±
SD from triplicate experiments performed in a parallel
manner unless otherwise indicated. Statistically significant
differences (One-way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni’s
Multiple Comparison Test) were determined using
GraphPad Prism 6 software. A value of P< 0.05 was
considered significant, and values of P< 0.01 and P< 0.001
were considered highly significant.

Co-immunoprecipitation and
immunofluorescence assay
Co-immunoprecipitation of EGFR with NM
IIA and their co-localization in GCs are described in
Supplementary Methods.
