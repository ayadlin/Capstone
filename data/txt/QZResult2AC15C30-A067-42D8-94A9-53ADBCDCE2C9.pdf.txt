ABSTRACT
To date there has not been any report on catan-ionic hybrid lipidic nano-carriers,
let alone a report on applying them to deliver insoluble anti-tumor drugs. Catanionic hybrid lipidic nano-carriers containing curcumin (CUR-C-HLN) inherit the merits
of catan-ionic systems, hybrid lipidic systems and nano-structured carriers (the
second-generation substitute of solid lipidic nano-systems). Catan-ionic surfactants
increased microvesicle stabilization by producing unordered isometric clusters,
enhanced absorptive amount as an inhibitor of enzyme and protein, improved
tumor accumulation by cellular endocytosis and membranous fusion; hybrid lipids
helped to obtain high drug content and low leakage by forming a less-organized
matrix arrangement. CUR-C-HLN favorably changed absorptive and pharmacokinetic
properties after oral and/or intravenous administrations; improved cell growth
inhibition, apoptotic inducing and anti-invasion effects; enhanced antitumor efficiency
and reduced cancerous growth. Catan-ionic hybrid lipidic nano-carriers provide an
alternative good choice for effective delivery of anticancerous chemodrugs.

INTRODUCTION

generation substitute of solid lipidic nano-particles, have
been developed in the last decade and able to compensate
the drawbacks of solid lipidic nano-particles. HLNs
have a higher drug loading capacity and element drug
stacking [14] and less incorporation of drug expulsion
from the vesicles compared to first-generation nanosystems because HLNs conceive a less-organized matrix
arrangement by blending fluid lipids with solid lipids [15].
HLNs have shown the potential for drug deliveries, such
as gene delivery [16], chemical drug delivery [17] and
herbal drug delivery [18]. In the case of antitumor drugs,
HLNs have been investigated for nasal delivery of CUR to
increase its cytotoxicity against astrocytoma-glioblastoma
cells [19], lung delivery of anticancerous chemicals and
siRNA to suppress lung tumor growth and prevent adverse
side effects [20], intravenous delivery of tributyrin to
improve anti-breast cancer activity [21], oral delivery
of tamoxifen to enhance in vivo antitumor efficacy with
reduced adverse drug effects [22], etc. The catan-ionic
nano-systems consist of positive and negative charged

The most frequently used chemotherapy drugs
for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [1], such as
cisplatin and vinblastine, have high anti-tumor activity and
severe toxic effects [2, 3]. It is necessary to create novel,
efficacious and harmless treatment methods. Curcumin
(CUR), a polyphenol extracted from the herb turmeric,
shows cytotoxicity in three main kinds of NSCLCs:
adenocarcinoma [4], squamous [5] and large-cell cancers
[6]. Furthermore, CUR shows no effects on normal cells
or animal models tested at a high dose of up to 10 g per
day [7]. But, like other chemodrugs, further application
of CUR has been seriously obstructed by unsatisfactory
pharmcokinetic properties and poor tumor cell targeting.
Lipidic nano-systems [8, 9], including the early
emerging systems (nano-emulsions and nano-liposomes)
[10–12] and the later emerging ones (solid lipidic nanoparticles) [13], are already used in clinical practice.

surfactants. They have raised great interests lately, since
they possess increased stability [23], absorptive amount
[10, 24] and cellular accumulation [25]. It is reasonable
to assume that the catan-ionic HLNs (C-HLN) inherit the
merits of HLNs and catan-ionic systems and act as a new
generation of versatile therapeutic delivery platforms.
Obviously, laboratory experiments and animal trials are
crucial to judge this hypothesis. However, to date there has
not been any report on C-HLN in general or on applying
C-HLN to deliver insoluble chemodrugs.
Herein, catan-ionic hybrid lipidic nano-carriers
containing CUR (CUR-C-HLN) are design and fabricated
to effectively deliver CUR for the first time. Compared with
the catan-ionic solid lipidic nano-systems [23] recently
reported by us, CUR-C-HLN might be served as the second
generation catan-ionic lipidic nano-systems integrating the
merits of catan-ionic systems, hybrid lipidic systems and
nano-structured carriers (the second-generation of lipidic
nano-systems). CUR-C-HLN significantly improves
bioavailability and greatly increases anti-lung cancerous
effects of CUR. CUR-C-HLN was fabricated according
to the optimized formula and characterized by Fouriertransformed infrared (FTIR) and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). The features of CUR-C-HLN as
nano-carriers of chemodrugs were investigated according
to micro-morphology, drug content, encapsulation ratio,
release amount, and in vitro cytotoxicity. Additionally, the
bioavailability and pharmacokinetic characteristics were
evaluated via two administration routes. The antitumor
efficacies in cancerous mice were evaluated.

The optimal formula was obtained by a four-factor
and five-level central composite design-response surface
methodology (CCD-RSM) (Figure 1A). The encapsulation
ratio (between ~12% and ~96%) and drug content
(between ~1% and ~7%) of 30 lots changed significantly
(Supplementary Table 2). The fitting models are listed as
follows:	
Y1 = 88.90 – 12.09 X1+ 8.23 X2+3.15 X3 + 2.60
X4 – 5.89 X1 X2 + 5.66 X1 X3 + 1.36 X1 X4 + 4.90

(r = 0.9739)
Y2 = 5.05 – 0.84 X1 – 0.39 X2+ 0.70 X3 + 0.86

(r = 0.9543)
As shown in the above equations and past research
[27, 28], the optimal values for X1, X2, X3 and X4 should
be 70.24 mg, 54.07 mg, 117.35 mg and 168.77 μmol,
respectively. The predicted values and the experimental
results of CUR-C-HLN prepared under the optimal
protocol were fairly consistent (Supplementary Table 3).

Elementary properties of CUR-C-HLN
As depicted in Figure 1E, CUR-C-HLN could
obviously increase the in vitro release amounts of CUR in
the simulated human digestive fluids. The Weibull models
were used for fitting the release data (Table 1). Statistically
differences existed between release data of CUR-C-HLN
and CUR (Supplementary Table 4). As shown in Figure 1F,
the peaks or the intensities of 1508 and 1604 cm-1
(benzene ring: stretching vibration), 1629 (unsaturated
ketone: stretching vibration) in the IR spectro-scopy of
the physically mixing compound reduced or disappeared
in the CUR-C-HLN curve. As depicted in Figure 1G, the
calorimetric curve of CUR presented a peak at 177°C
(melting point). The endothermic peaks of 20°C, 70°C
and 121°C in the curve of the mixing compound changed
to peaks of 17°C, 47°C and 99°C with lower intensities
in the CUR-C-HLN spectrum, which suggested that CUR
had been enclosed in the C-HLNs. It was noted that the
peak at 177°C of CUR in the thermogram disappeared in
the physical mixture, which might be explained by the
theory of preparation by melt-out method [27]; i.e., when
the temperature rose, C-HLN melt and CUR dissolved in
the C-HLN, partially forming the complex.

RESULTS
Fabrication of CUR-C-HLN
The CUR-C-HLNs were formulated and fabricated.
The CUR-C-HLNs, with a size of 235.9 ± 9.6 nm,
were evenly dispersed. The encapsulation ratio and
drug content were 93.23 ± 1.23 % and 6.75 ± 2.62 %
(n = 3), respectively (Figure 1A). The yellow CUR-CHLN suspensions (Figure 1B) tended to be circular and
dispersed separately (Figure 1C). Their electric potentials
were negative (–28.40 ± 0.35 mV, n = 3), which might
help keep these nano-particles stable [26]. The pH
and conductivities of CUR-C-HLN were 5.83 ± 0.01
and 613.33 ± 3.21 µs/cm (n = 3, 25°C), respectively
(Supplementary Table 1). As shown in Figure 1D, CURC-HLNs basically consisted of a binary lipid matrix of
solid lipidic (glycerin monostearate) and liquid lipidic
substances (isopropyl palmitate), the zwitter-ionic
surfactant and emulsifying agent (phospholipid), positivecharged surfactant (glycerin monostearate, cetyltrimethyl
ammonium bromide, CTAB) and negative-charged
surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS). The above two
surfactants comprised the catan-ionic surfactants.

Perfusion of CUR-C-HLN to improve the
absorptive behavior
The duodenum was the major site for CUR
absorption, which were markedly enhanced by entrapping
CUR inside the C-HLN vesicles (Figure 2A). CUR-CHLN also enhanced the absorptive amount of CUR in
other gastro-intestinal segments. The absorptive rate and

Improved pharmacokinetic properties of CURC-HLN via intravenous administration

permeability of CUR-C-HLNs in the stomach, duodenum,
colon, ileum and jejunum were separately 1.54-fold, 2.01fold (or 2.04-fold), 1.85-fold (or 2.29-fold), 1.74-fold (or
1.84-fold) and 1.35-fold (or 1.69-fold) those of CUR.

After the rats were intravenously given with CURC-HLN and free CUR, their pharmacokinetic behaviors
were presented in Figure 2C. The CUR concentrations
of CUR-C-HLNs decreased sharply in the first ten min
(from ~530 ng/mL at 5 min to ~200 ng/mL at 15 min) and
decreased slowly for the following 75 min (undetectable in
90 min). By comparing the AUC values, the bioavailability
of CUR-C-HLN to CUR was 618.20%. After intravenous
injection, bioequivalence of CUR-C-HLN and CUR was
considered not to be established (Table 2), and it had
higher AUC, MRT, Cmax and lower Cl values (6.18, 1.21,
5.91 and 0.16 times that of CUR).

Improved pharmacokinetic properties of CURC-HLN via oral administration
As shown in Figure 2B, the pharmacokinetic
behavior of CUR-C-HLN was more desirable compared
to free CUR. The CUR contents of CUR-C-HLN were
much larger than those of CUR. The maximal contents
came up at 10 min and 40 min for CUR-C-HLN or 15 min
for CUR, respectively.
Compared to free CUR, CUR-C-HLN possessed
favorable pharmacokinetic behavior. For example,
the values of CUR-C-HLN, such as the area under
concentration versus time profile (AUC), maximal
concentration (Cmax) and mean residence time (MRT) were
5.51-fold, 2.54-fold, 2.03-fold higher while the clearance
rate (Cl) were much slower (only one fifth). The relative
bioavailability of CUR-C-HLN versus CUR was 551.08%.
Furthermore, by computating the confident levels of AUC
and Cmax, and testing the Tmax values using the Wilcoxon
rank sum (Table 1), bioequivalence of CUR-C-HLN and
CUR was considered not to be established.

Cell growth inhibition, apoptotic inducing and
anti-invasion effects of CUR-C-HLN
CUR-C-HLN and free CUR inhibited the cancerous
cell growth in a dose dependent way (Figure 3A). The
50% inhibitive concentrations of CUR-C-HLN and CUR
at 24 h were 8.81 and 39.70 μmol/L, respectively. The
quantity of cells dealt with CUR-C-HLN were arrested
in the S phase of cell cycle (~92%) much more than
that with CUR (~82%), C-HLN (~66%) and the control
30924

(~41%) (Figure 3B). Similarly, as shown in Figure 3C, the
CUR-C-HLN-inducing apoptosis ratio (~68%) was much
higher than that of CUR (~7%). The apoptosis induction of
C-HLN and the negative control in cancerous cells were
ignorable.
The membranous potential of mitochondria in
LLC cells dealt with 20 μmol/L CUR-C-HLN and CUR
decreased a lot than that without treatment (the negative
control), but these two were significantly different
(Figure 3D). The calcium ion content measured in tumor
cells treated with CUR-C-HLN was 2-fold that of CUR
and 3-fold that of C-HLN and the control (Figure 3E).
Similarly, the active oxygen content in cells dealt
with CUR-C-HLN was much higher than that without
treatment or dealt with C-HLN (Figure 3F). As presented
in Figure 3G, the nuclei was appropriately stained and the

characteristics of apoptosis was readily visible in cells
dealt with CUR-C-HLNs and CUR for 1 d.
The anti-invasion effects of CUR-C-HLN were
observed by Transwell method. The invasive capabilities
of the tumor cells without treatment were 4.0 times and
1.8 times that of the cells dealt with CUR-C-HLN and
CUR (Figure 3H), respectively.

Antitumor efficiency of CUR-C-HLN
As shown in the Figure 4, the tumor volumes and
weights of cancerous mice administered with CUR-C-HLN
had the slowest increasing rate, compared with that of mice
in other three groups. The tumor inhibitory rate (~70%) in
mice given with CUR-C-HLN was the highest, while the
rate (~40%) in mice given with free CUR was much lower.

DISCUSSION

nanotechnologies have been introduced to overcome the
application limitations of CUR such as low bioavailability
and anticancerous effects. For examples, PLGA nanoparticles [31] and diblock copolymer micelles [32] were
fabricated to improve the anti-breast cancer activity of CUR;
lipidic nano-particles containing CUR and doxorubicin were
prepared to enhance the treatment effects of hepatocellular
carcinoma [33]; and polyethylene glycol derivatives
of vitamin E succinate self-assembled nano-particles
containing CUR and sorafenib were prepared to enhance
the curative effects on hepatocellular carcinoma [34].

According to a report from World Health
Organization, the mortality and incidence of lung cancer
in 2014 were unexpectedly high [29]. Chemotherapy is an
effective method for inoperatable patients or patients with
more advanced cancer, or is applied before surgery as a
neoadjuvant therapy or after surgery as an adjuvant therapy
[1]. CUR continues to attract more and more attention
owing to its high safety and anticancerous activities against
many cancerous cells [30]. In the last several decades,

Here, we first reported on a class of nanocarriers,
i.e., catan-ionic hybrid lipidic nano-particles. These
nano-carriers could efficiently deliver CUR to achieve
enhancement of bioavailability via oral and intravenous
routes and improve anti-lung cancerous effects. Unlike
common lipidic nano-particles, CUR-C-HLNs had catanionic surfactants and binary lipids (Figure 1D). The positive
and negative charged surfactants (catan-ionic surfactants),
the zwitter-ionic surfactant and emulsifying agent existed in
the interfacial region of nano-carriers and the external water
by means of self-shaping into a stable shell that surrounded
the nano-particles. The catan-ionic surfactants were also
able to enhance CUR accumulation in cancerous cells
following endocytosis or membranous fusion [25]. Hybrid
lipidic substances (a blended lipidic matrix of a solid
lipidic glycerin monostearate and a fluid lipidic isopropyl
palmitate) made up the core of the nano-particles, held
the insoluble CUR as much as possible, and avoided drug
expulsion by conceiving a less-organized matrix alignment
[35]. The preparation process of CUR-C-HLN was easily
manipulated and suitable for large-scale production.
The optimal recipe for CUR-C-HLN was obtained
using a four-factor and five-level CCD-RSM method
[27, 28]. Our tests helped to understand the complex
relationship between the variables (vesicular components)
and the response (CUR content and encapsulation ratio).
The encapsulation ratio of CUR-C-HLN was higher
than that of the other core-shell delivery systems (such
as mPEG-PCL micelles) [36] or lung-targeted delivery
systems (such as gelatin microspheres) (88 ± 3.32% or
75.5  ±  3.82%) [37]. The infrared and calorimetric data
of CUR-C-HLN suggested that CUR was successfully
entrapped in the nano-particles.
Compared to free CUR, CUR-C-HLN obviously
enhanced the in situ absorptive rate and permeability
of CUR which undoubtedly contribute to the gastrointestinal absorptive amount. However, although it was
reported that the concentration-independent intestinal

absorption of CUR in one lipidic nanosystem (i.e., selfmicroemulsifying systems) was passively transferred [38],
greater efforts were still needed before we determine the
transfer method of CUR in other lipidic nano-systems
(i.e., CUR-C-HLN). Increased absorptive amount of
CUR-C-HLN might be explained by the solubilization
of CUR by solid and fluid liquidic matrixes; protection
from elimination by incorporating CUR inside the nanoparticles which contained surfactant inhibitor of enzyme
CYP3A and protein P-gp [10, 24] (CUR was an enzymatic
and proteinic substrate) [39]; a high dispersibility of CUR
in binary lipids, surfactant-induced membrane fluidity; etc.
CUR-C-HLN displayed superior pharmacokinetic
curves than free CUR after oral administration. The
explanations for the maximal concentration peaks in the
CUR-C-HLN curves are listed as follows: the first one was
due to the presence of cationic, anionic and zwitter-ionic
surfactants; the second one was because of a slow release
of CUR incorporated in solid and fluid lipidic matrixes.
Compared to free CUR, CUR-C-HLN had higher in vivo
absorption, which was consistent with the outcome of
in situ absorptive tests and in vitro release tests; CUR-CHLN stayed longer time in plasma and cleared at a slower
rate, which extended action time as well as effectiveness.
The bioavailability of CUR-C-HLN to CUR was ~550%.
Other systems (self-nano phospholipid dispersion or
imprinted-like biopolymeric micelles) were documented
to increase the CUR bioavailability whether or not they
containing lipids [41]. After intravenous administration,
the bioavailability of CUR solid lipidic nano-particles
was lower as compared to that of CUR-C-HLN (125%
versus 618%) [42].
CUR-C-HLN markedly enhanced the cell growth
inhibition, apoptotic inducing and anti-invasion effects
of CUR in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The IC50 value of
CUR-C-HLN was only around one-fifth that of free CUR,
indicating the much higher anticancerous effects of CURC-HLN. In recent decades, a few CUR delivery systems

exhibited stronger cytotoxicities against cancerous
cells compared to CUR. For example, PNIPAAm-MAA
nanoparticles [43] inhibited the growth of breast cancer
MCF-7 cells more efficiently, and PEG2000-oleoyl chloride
diblock copolymer micelles suppressed proliferation of
mammary and hepatocellular carcinoma 4T1 and HuH7 cells more intensively [32]. Compared to free CUR,
CUR-C-HLN induced a higher degree of S phase arrest
and apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis might be
involved with the decreased membranous potential and
increased calcium-ion and active oxygen. CUR caused
cell-cycle arrest with subsequent apoptosis in A549 cells
[7, 44] and the apoptosis in NSCLC cells (H1299 and
A549) in calcium-dependent ways [45]. CUR-C-HLN
displayed better suppression of invasion compared to
CUR. CUR inhibited cell growth and invasive ability in
lung cancerous cells by modifying Wnt/β-catenin or Racdependent pathways [46, 47]. The anticancer activities
of CUR were improved to various extent by most nanocarriers, and the action mechanisms varied according to
the type of cancer [48].
Investigation on pharmacodynamics of CUR-CHLN in cancerous mice showed that CUR-C-HLN had
superior anti-lung tumor effects to that of free CUR. The
reasons might be ascribed to the following characteristics:
encapsulation of CUR inside C-HLN made it feasible
for CUR to circulate in the blood system at relative high
concentrations for much longer time, and then have much
higher in vivo bioavailability; high-dispersity of CUR in
hybrid lipids and catan-ionic surfactants were beneficial to
increase the tumor uptake of CUR following endocytosis
and membranous fusion [25]; CUR-C-HLN showed higher
antitumor activity against cancerous cells via combinative
mechanisms such as cell growth inhibition, apoptotic
inducing and anti-invasion effects. Previously, it was
reported that CUR suppressed lung cancer progression in
C57BL/6 mice bearing xenografted cells via increase of
the HIF1α/mTOR/VEGF/VEGFR cascade [49] and was
effective in treating lung cancer by regulating oncogenes
such as p53, enzymes such as LOX, transcription factors
such as STAT-3 and protein kinases such as MAPK [50].

Fabrication of CUR-C-HLN
CUR-C-HLNs were prepared by a thin film
dispersion-sonication method. Glycerin monostearate,
isopropyl palmitate, phospholipid and CUR were put in
ethanol and subjected to sonication for 120 sec to obtain
a yellowish solution. Then, the ethanol was evaporated
at 30°C under hypobaric conditions until a light yellow
film appeared. The film was then added to distilled water
containing CTAB and SDS (1 mol : 2 mol) and sonicated
for 10 min to obtain a yellow suspension. The optimal
formula of CUR-C-HLNs was obtained by CCD-RSM
method (Supplementary Table 2). The experimental
results revealed that factors such as isopropyl palmitate
and canta-ionic surfactant exerted strong influences on the
encapsulate ratio and CUR content.

Elementary characteristics of C-C-HLN
The features of CUR-C-HLNs in particulate
diameter and charge were measured by Malven ZetaSizer
(Nano-ZS90). The micromorphology was assessed by
TEM method. The release amounts of CUR-C-HLNs in
pH 1.2 or pH 6.8 aqueous media were measured by dialysis
technique and calculated by model-fitting method [51]. The
IR spectroscopic and calorimetric methods were applied to
evaluate the entrapment of CUR in CUR-C-HLNs.

Absorptive behavior in gastric and intestinal
tracts
In situ gastro-intestinal perfusion methods [10, 28]
were used to determine the absorptive behavior of CURC-HLN. In the gastric absorptive tests, the stomachs of
anesthetized rats were perfused with CUR-C-HLNs,
which remained there for 2 h before being drawn out and
determined by HPLC. In the intestinal absorptive study,
each duodenal, jejunal, ileal and colonic segment was
attached to the perfusion assembly, which consisted of a
BT100-1L peristaltic pump and equilibrated with KrebsRinger solution at 24 mL/h for a quarter. Intestinal segments
were perfused with CUR-C-HLN at 12 mL/h for 1 h. The
remaining perfusion was then determined by HPLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials and animals
CUR was purchased from Sciphar Biotechnology
Co. Ltd (Xi’an, China). Lipoid-S 75 was provided from
Phospholipid GmbH. (Koeln, Germany). CTAB and SDS
were purchased from Kelong Chemical Co. (China).
Isopropyl palmitate was bought from Kingboc Co.
(Jiaxing, China). The Sprague Dawley rats (230 ± 20 g)
and C57BL/6J mice (20 ± 2 g) were supplied by the
Laboratory Animal Center of Chongqing Medical
University and Third Military Medical University (China).
All animal experiments were performed in accordance

Pharmacokinetic properties
CUR and CUR-C-HLN were administered to the
rats via oral or intravenous routes. Blood taken from eyes
were centrifuged and mixed with nitrendipine (0.1 mL)
and ethyl acetate (1 mL). After centrifugation, the lower
layer was dried and resolved with a mixed solution of
acetonitrile and 5% acetic acid (55 mL:45 mL) for a
HPLC analysis [7, 23]. The pharmacokinetic profiles were
calculated by a DAS 2.1.1 software.

Cell growth inhibition, apoptotic inducing and
anti-invasion effects of CUR-C-HLN

The authors declare that no competing financial
interests exist.

The tumor cells were cultivated at a concentration
of 5000 cells in each well. The media was substituted with
different media containing different amounts of CUR-CHLN in 2 d and 20 µL of MTT solution in another 2 d. The
absorptive values were detected at 490 nm.
The tumor cells were added with CUR-C-HLN for
1 d and harvested by trypsinization. After centrifugation,
they were fixed and then suspended in a PI/RNase
solution for 0.5 h. The cellular cycle was evaluated by a
FACSVantage flow cytometer [7]. The cellular apoptosis
was investigated by an Annexin V-FITC-PI kit. The
tumor cells were added with CUR-C-HLN for 1 d and
stained with Rhodamine, Fluo 3 and DCFH for 0.5 h and
determined using flowcytometer FACS Vantage.
The tumor cells added with CUR-C-HLN for 1 d
were placed in the Matrigel-coated Transwell upper
chamber and incubated for another 1 d. The invaded cells
in the lower chamber were observed [52].

Antitumor efficiency of CUR-C-HLN
C-HLN, 0.9% NaCl, CUR or CUR-C-HLN (50 µg
per mouse) was given to tumor-bearing mice (C57BL-6J)
one time every 48 h for 14 days via intraperitoneal
route, respectively. Each group had 6 mice. The tumor
volume and weight were recorded 48 h later after the last
administration [53, 54].

CONCLUSIONS
A new kind of catan-ionic hybrid lipidic nanocarriers (C-HLN) was devised to deliver CUR and
overcome its defects. Compared to CUR, CUR-C-HLN
improved absorptive and pharmacokinetic behaviors,
increased the tumor cell growth inhibition, apoptotic
inducing and anti-invasion effects, enhanced the antitumor
efficiency. This work was the first to report on fabricating
catan-ionic hybrid lipidic nano-particles to deliver
insoluble antitumor drugs to treat tumor. The CUR-CHLN provides a useful option for efficient delivery of
anti-tumor chemodrugs.
