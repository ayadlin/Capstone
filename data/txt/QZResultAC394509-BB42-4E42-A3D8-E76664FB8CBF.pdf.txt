Abstract

Author Manuscript

Infectious agents develop intricate mechanisms to interact with host cell pathways and hijack the
genetic and epigenetic machinery to change phenotypic states. Amongst the Apicomplexa phylum
of obligate intracellular parasites which cause veterinary and human diseases, Theileria is the only
genus which transforms its mammalian host cells1. Theileria infection of bovine leukocytes
induces proliferative and invasive phenotypes associated with activated signalling pathways,
notably JNK and AP-12. The transformed phenotypes are reversed by treatment with the
theilericidal drug Buparvaquone3. We used comparative genomics to identify a homologue of the
Peptidyl Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 (designated TaPin1) in T. annulata which is secreted into the host

cell and modulates oncogenic signalling pathways. Here we show that TaPin1 is a bona fide prolyl
isomerase and that it interacts with the host ubiquitin ligase FBW7 leading to its degradation and
subsequent stabilization of c-Jun which promotes transformation. We performed in vitro analysis
and in vivo zebrafish xenograft experiments to demonstrate that TaPin1 is directly inhibited by the
anti-parasite drug Buparvaquone (and other known Pin1 inhibitors) and is mutated in a drugresistant strain. Prolyl isomerisation is thus a conserved mechanism which is important in cancer
and is used by Theileria parasites to manipulate host oncogenic signaling.

To identify proteins secreted by Theileria into the host cell which could contribute to
transformation4–6, we conducted an in silico screen of parasite genomes; we identified 689
proteins in the T. annulata genome with a predicted signal peptide. Comparison with T.
gondii (a non-transforming apicomplexan parasite) proteome, narrowed the candidate list to
33 proteins with a Theileria-specific signal peptide (Extended Data Fig. 1a). We focused on
the TA18945 gene encoding a homologue of the human parvulin Pin1 (hPin1) Peptidyl
Prolyl Isomerase (PPIase) as mammalian Pin1 regulates cell proliferation, pluripotency and
survival7,8 and contributes to tumorigenesis9,10. hPin1 catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization
of peptidyl-prolyl bonds in phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs inducing conformational
changes that affect substrate stability and activity11,12 and there are several small-molecule
inhibitors of hPin113–15. The TA18945-encoded protein has a signal peptide and a highly
conserved PPIase domain (Extended Data Fig. 1b–c), but lacks the WW domain important
for substrate recognition of mammalian Pin111. A gene in the T. parva genome, also
associated with transformation, encodes a conserved TpPin1 predicted protein, whereas the
signal peptide is not conserved in the related T. orientalis genome which does not transform
host cells16 (Extended Data Fig. 2a–b). We detected Theileria Pin1 transcripts in B cells
infected with T. annulata or T. parva and they decreased upon Buparvaquone treatment
(Fig. 1a). The levels of host bovine BtPin1 transcripts were unaffected by Theileria infection
or Buparvaquone treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3). An antibody generated against a
TaPin1-specific peptide (NPVNRNTGMAVTR) recognized parasite Pin1 protein or
transfected TaPin1 in mouse fibroblasts, but not mammalian Pin1 (Fig. 1b, Extended Data
Fig. 4a–e). Confocal microscopy and immunoblot analysis located the parasite Pin1 protein
to both the host cell cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1b–c, Extended Data Fig. 4c–d). The host
nuclear signal in the confocal images was 10-fold over background in parasitized cells
(205.0 ± 15.48 nuclear fluorescence intensity/pixel compared to 21.45 ± 8.50 in controls
p<0.0001, n=31). Thus, comparative parasite genomics identified TaPin1 which is secreted
into the host cytoplasm and nucleus.

To explore the functional PPIase activity of the secreted TaPin1 protein, we developed a
chymotrypsin-coupled in vitro assay and found that TaPin1 and hPin1 catalytic activities
were comparable (Fig. 2a). TaPin1 and hPin1 were also equivalent in activation of the
cyclinD1-Luciferase reporter in bovine B cells (Fig. 2b), an established readout for Pin1
activity9. We mutated key C92 and K38 residues in TaPin1 and showed loss of the PPIase
activity (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, TaPin1 rescued cyclinD1 promoter activity and cell
spreading defects in pin1-/- mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 5a). Mammalian
Pin1 overexpression disrupts cell cycle regulation causing centrosome amplification and cell
transformation17. TaPin1 also induced centrosome duplication when overexpressed in

mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 5b). Furthermore, TaPin1 functionally
replaced mammalian Pin1 and rescued colony formation as effectively as hPin1 in human
breast cancer cells with knocked-down Pin1 (Fig. 2f). These combined results show that
Theileria secretes a bona fide phosphorylation-dependent PPIase which could contribute to
host cell transformation.

In a search for potential inhibitors, we noted that the chemical structure of Buparvaquone is
similar to Juglone, a well-characterized inhibitor of mammalian Pin113. The TaPin1
sequence exhibits over 47% identity with hPin1 in the PPIase domain (Extended Data Fig.
6a). Our homology models of TaPin1 protein based on published hPin1 experimental data
suggest a similar structure with a conserved catalytic pocket (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig.
6b). Notably, several Pin1 homologues also lack the WW domain, including Arabidopsis
thaliana Pin1At18–20, MdPin1 in Malus domestica and the parasite Trypanosoma brucei
TbPin1 homologue20–22, and the predicted TaPin1 model closely resembles these structures
(Extended Data Fig. 6d). We investigated the hPin1 experimental structure and the TaPin1
predicted model with the binding pocket and hot-spot detection algorithm FTMap, using the
server FTFlex. Notably, we found key hot-spot regions in the catalytic site area, matching
the substrate binding region of hPin1 (Extended Data Fig. 6). Juglone and Buparvaquone
molecules could be docked into the active site of both TaPin1 and hPin1 by in silico analysis
(Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 6c). We predicted that Buparvaquone might target TaPin1
directly and that Juglone (or other Pin1 inhibitors) could functionally replace Buparvaquone
to block parasite transformation. Both Buparvaquone and Juglone inhibited TaPin1 PPIase
activity in vitro, as did the unrelated non-quinone inhibitor DTM14, albeit to a lesser degree
(Fig. 3b). Buparvaquone-resistant Theileria strains are an emerging clinical concern for
cattle in infected areas23 and mutations in the cytochrome B gene were recently reported24.
But mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial pathways might cooperate in transformation and
participate in drug resistance. We sequenced the TaPin1 gene in genomic DNA from a drugresistant isolate and identified a mutation (A53>P substitution) in the catalytic loop of
TaPin1 (Extended Data Fig. 7). Structural modeling suggested that this mutation could
affect the nearby catalytic region and disturb ligand binding; computational docking
indicated that the small Juglone molecule could react with the thiolate group of C113 or C92
in hPin1, TaPin1 or mutant TaPin1-A53P. However, the A53P mutation might impede
interaction with the bulky, hydrophobic moiety of the larger Buparvaquone compound
(MW=326, cf. Juglone MW=176), creating steric clashes between the inhibitor and residues
in the modified structure (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 6c). Mutant TaPin1-A53P was
catalytically active on the Pin1 substrate and was inhibited by Juglone and DTM, but not by
Buparvaquone (Fig. 3b). The Pin1 inhibitors (Buparvaquone, Juglone and DTM) all reduced
parasite load and viability of host cells infected with T. annulata or T. parva (Fig. 3c–d,
Extended Data Fig. 8a) and blocked colony growth of parasitized cells in soft-agar assays in
vitro (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 8b). In contrast, knocking down the endogenous bovine
BtPin1 did not affect colony formation (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Transfection with mutant
TaPin1-A53P rendered TBL3 cells resistant to Buparvaquone, but not Juglone, treatment
(Extended Data Fig. 8d). Similarly, Juglone inhibited both WT and mutant TaPin1 activity
in the cyclinD1-luciferase assay, but only the mutant was resistant to Buparvaquone
(Extended Data Fig. 8e). Fish xenograft models are effective for monitoring in vivo tumor

formation and for drug testing25 and are emerging as important experimental models to
study cancer26. We used a zebrafish xenograft experimental system to test drug effects on
tumor growth in vivo and observed a two-fold increase in tumor growth of infected cells
which was efficiently inhibited by the anti-Pin1 drugs (Fig. 3f–g). Thus, our modelling
predictions, biochemical analysis in vitro, transformation assays and tumor growth in vivo
all support the targeting of TaPin1 by Buparvaquone and the role of TaPin1 in Theileriainduced cell transformation.

To investigate how TaPin1 affects host signaling pathways, we studied relevant substrates
targeted by TaPin1. hPin1 targets many proteins, including the ubiquitin ligase FBW727,
which exerts anti-tumor function by degrading oncoproteins required for cellular
proliferation, such as c-Jun28,29. Since c-Jun is induced (and critical) during Theileriainduced transformation2, we examined whether TaPin1 targets the conserved bovine FBW7
protein. We found that TaPin1 interacts with host FBW7 in Theileria-infected cells or
murine fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 9a–b). Conversely, FBW7α in particular, but not
other isoforms, co-immunoprecipitated TaPin1 from parasitized cells (Fig. 4a). FBW7α
protein levels were reduced in parasitized cells compared with uninfected cells and
correlated with elevated c-Jun levels (Fig. 4b). Pharmacological TaPin1 inhibition restored
FBW7 protein expression and reduced c-Jun levels, without affecting mRNA expression
(Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9c–d). But knocking-down bovine Pin1 did not affect FBW7 or
c-Jun protein levels (Extended Data Fig. 9e). siRNA FBW7 knockdown caused
accumulation of c-Jun protein, whereas exogenous FBW7α transfection decreased c-Jun
protein levels (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, knocking-down FBW7 increased AP-1 activity,
measured by a Luciferase reporter assay, and rescued the inhibition of AP-1 by
Buparvaquone or Juglone (Fig. 4d–e). TaPin1 inhibition caused increased c-Jun
ubiquitination in TBL3 cells and decreased FBW7 (auto)-ubiquitination (Extended Data Fig.
9f). c-Jun ubiquitination was FBW7-dependent, as this effect was abolished by siRNA
targeting bovine FBW7 (Fig. 4f). Half-life analysis using cycloheximide showed that
siFBW7 increased c-Jun stability and rescued c-Jun levels following TaPin1 inhibition (Fig.
4g). In addition, the TaPin1-A53P mutant rescued the effect of Buparvaquone, but not
Juglone, on c-Jun ubiquitination and transcriptional activity (reflected by the MMP-9 AP-1
target gene) (Extended Data Fig. 8f, Fig. 9g). As mammalian FBW7 targets many protein
substrates, we examined the effects of Buparvaquone treatment or FBW7α transfection, but
noted no changes in levels of endogenous c-Myc or activated Notch 1 proteins, while there
was a modest effect on the KLF5 transcription factor (Extended Data Fig. 9h, i). These
combined results suggest that c-Jun is the major target of TaPin1-FBW7α in our cells.
Finally, FBW7α overexpression or c-Jun knockdown both caused significant reduction of
colony growth in soft-agar proliferation assays of parasitized TBL3 cells (Fig. 4h).
c-Jun is critical for Theileria transformation and host cell proliferation2, but it was
previously unknown how the parasite initiated this effect. In TBL3 cells, c-Jun seems to be
activated by reduced FBW7 degradation rather than phosphorylation by JNK signaling2.
Subsequent activation of a feedback loop, involving c-Jun control of the miR-155 oncomiR,
could create a epigenetic switch to maintain transformation and proliferation30. We studied

(TBL3) and are currently investigating Theileria-transformed T lymphocytes and
macrophages. Our discovery of mutation in the TaPin1 gene, suggests that new anti-Pin1
compounds might be effective clinical reagents to treat drug-resistant theileriosis. Finally,
the evolution of a Pin1 homolog with an acquired signal peptide only in T. annulata and T.
parva genomes, provides fascinating insight into how apicomplexan species have hijacked
oncogenic pathways to maintain host cell transformation.

All infected bovine cell lines used in this study were previously described: TBL3 cells were
derived from in vitro infection of the spontaneous bovine-B lymphosarcoma cell line, BL3,
with Hissar stock of T.annulata. The TpMD409 lymphocyte cell line is infected with T.
parva. The culture conditions of these cell lines were described previously31. All parasiteinfected cell lines were provided by the Langsley laboratory. Cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 (Gibco-BRL), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal calf serum, 4mM LGlutamine, 25mM HEPES, 10μM β-mercaptoethanol and 100μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin
in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. NIH3T3 and Murine Immortalized Fibroblasts
cells were kindly provided by C. Francastel (UMR7216 Epigenetics and Cell Fates, Paris,
France) and G. Del Sal (LNCIB - Laboratorio Nazionale CIB, Trieste, Italy), respectively.
MCF10A Ras/Neu – shPin1 were previously described 17. Murine and human cell lines were
cultured in DMEM (Gibco-BRL, Paisley, UK), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
Fetal calf serum, 4mM L-Glutamine and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Cell numbers, as judged by Trypan Blue exclusion test, were
determined by counting cells using a Countess automated cell counter (Invitrogen). All cell
lines were mycoplasma negatives. The anti-parasite drug Buparvaquone (BW720c)3 was
used at 200ng/ml for 72 hours (Chemos GmbH, Ref: 88426-33-9). BW720c has no effect on
growth of uninfected cells (Hudson, 1985). Cells were treated with Juglone at 5μM
resuspended in Ethanol (Sigma, Ref: H47003), DTM at 1μM resuspended in DMSO (DTM

Total proteins were extracted with Laemmli lysis buffer, sonicated: 30 secs ON/30 secs OFF
for 5min, resolved on 10.5% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) in transfer buffer. Protein
transfer was assessed by Ponceau-red staining. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered
saline pH7.4 containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature.
Incubations with primary antibodies were carried out at 4°C overnight using antibody

Parasite Quantification

Author Manuscript

After indicated treatments, parasite-infected cells were plated on slides using CytoSpin
centrifugation at 2000rpm for 10min. Cells were fixed in PBS 3.7% Formaldehyde for
15min at room temperature. Slides were mounted and coverslipped with ProLong Gold
Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen, Ref: P-36931). Images of immunofluoresence
staining were photographed with a fluorescent microscope (Leica Inverted 6000) and the
number of parasites per cells was counted. Staining was repeated for three independent
biological replicates.
PPIase Assay
The PPIase activity of GST constructs: GST-Control, GST-hPin1, GST-TaPin1 WT and
GST-TaPin1 A53P were determined using the protease-free PPIase activity assay11. The
sample buffer was 35 mM Hepes (pH 7.5). We prepared stock solutions of the substrates

This study was approuved by the Institutional Comitee for animal Welfare of the University
of Burgundy. Zebrafish and embryos were raised, staged and maintained according to
standard procedures in compliance with the local animal welfare regulations (University of
Burgundy). Dechorionized 2 old zebrafish embryos were anaesthetized with 0.003% tricain
(Sigma) and positioned on a 10 cm Petridish before inplantation, TBL3 or BL3 cells were
treated for 24h with DTM, Buparvaquone or Juglone, rinsed with PBS, labeled with the
fluorescent cell tracker CM-DiI (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspensions were loaded into borosilicate glass capillary
needles and the injections were performed using a microinjector (Femtojet, Eppendorf). 20–
100 cells, manually counted in injection droplets, were injected in the yolk within 3-4 hours
after labelling. Around 30-100 embryos were implanted per cell line. After implantation,
zebrafish embryos (including non-implanted controls) were maintained at 34 °C in egg
water containing 0.003% Phenylthiourea (PTU). For individual tumor development analysis,
each xenografted embryo was grown in separate well in 12 well plates. Tumor growth was
monitored at day1 and and day 4 after injection by imaging the zebrafish embryos with a
Zeiss AxioZoom V16 Macroscope. Images were acquired using 2.3x objective and analyzed
with Zen software. For the estimation of tumor foci size, red fluorescent aerea was mesured
with Zen software and data were transfered to excel for further calculations. No method of
randomization was used to determine how animals were allocated to experimental groups.

BL3 and TBL3 cells were plated on Fibronectin coated slides (Sigma; Ref: F1141).
NIH/3T3 cells and Mouse Immortalized Fibroblasts cells-transfected by indicated constructs
were plated on slides. All cells were then fixed in PBS 3.7% Formaldehyde for 15min at
room temperature. Slides with bovines cells or NIH/3T3 cells were rinsed in PBS and
permeabilized with PBS 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5min and then blocked for 30min with PBS
1% SVF and 1% BSA to prevent non-specific staining. These slides were incubated with
rabbit anti-TaPin1 (1/250) and/or mouse anti-HA (1/1000, Roche, Ref: 11583816001) in
PBS 1% SVF and 1% BSA at room temperature for 40min. After washing in PBS 0.2%
Tween, the slides were incubated with Texas Red dye-conjugated AffinyPure Donkey antirabbit IgG and/or Cy2 AffinyPure Donkey anti-mouse IgG (1/5000, Jackson Immunology,
Ref: 711-075-152 or Ref: 715-225-150) for 30min. Slides with Murine Immortalized
Fibroblasts cells were incubated for 15min with Phalloïdin-TRITC (Life Technologies, Ref:

Confocal microscopy analysis
Acquisitions were made on a ZEISS LSM710 laser scanning confocal. Texas Red was
acquired using a 561nm DPSS laser diode, emission captured between 587 and 690 nm.
DAPI was acquired using a 405nm laser diode, emission captured between 410 and 506nm.
Images were taken with a 60x/NA 1.4 objective, with a 2.5 zoom factor so that image pixel

nucleus fluorescence intensity/pixel quantifications were performed using the software
Imaris 6.7.5 (Bitplane). Quantifications were done on the whole nucleus of n=31 bovine
infected or non-infected cells after 3D construction and normalized to the background signal
obtained after staining with the anti-Rabbit secondary antibody alone.

Analysis of centrosome duplication during S-phase
Centrosome duplication assays in NIH3T3 cells were conducted, as described previously17.
Cells were arrested in G1/S phase by adding Aphidicolin (Sigma, Ref: A0781) at final
concentration of 10μg/ml for 24h. Cells were fixed with cold-Methanol for 10min at −20°C,
then stained for centrosome with anti-Gamma-Tubulin antibody (Sigma, Ref: Clone
GTU-88, T5326), and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy, as described in the
“ Immunofluorescence” section.
Luciferase Assay

Author Manuscript

Non-treated or treated bovine cells were transfected with the cyclinD1 or BIC Luciferase
reporters, using electroporation (Neon kit, Invitrogen, Ref: MPK1096). Mouse cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Ref: 11668019). Transfection efficiencies
were normalized to Renilla activity by co-transfection of a pRL-TK Renilla reporter plasmid
(Promega, Ref: E6241). Luciferase assays were performed 36h post-transfection using the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Ref: E1980) in a microplate
luminometer. Relative luminescence was represented as the ratio Firefly/Renilla
luminescence, compared with the corresponding empty vector control.

Data and statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

The GraphPad PRISM 6 program (GraphPad Software Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for
statistics. The results presented in all the figures represent the average ± sd of at least three
independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the One-way ANOVA
test – multiple comparisons test. The p-values were corrected for the multiple comparisons
using the Bonferroni correction based on the total overall number of pairwise comparisons
for the Figure 1b. The p-values were calculated using the approach of Dunnett for multiple
comparisons with the TaPin1WT for Figure 2c. For Figures 2b / 2d / 2e / 2f / 3c / 3d / 3e: the
p-values were corrected using the Dunnett multiple comparisons with the control. The pvalues with the Bonferroni method based on the number of pairwise comparisons were
calculated for Figure 4e. The statistics in Figure 4h used the Dunnett procedure. Finally an
unpaired Mann-Whitney test was performed for the zebrafish experiments to analyze the
significant difference between the control and treatment groups. The SPSS 19.0 program
(SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistics in all Extended Data Figures. The
results presented in these Extended Data Figures represent the average ± sd of at least three
independent experiments. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant and are
indicated with asterisks *,p<0.05; **,p<0.01; ***,p<0.001.
Bioinformatic screen

On 9-10-2011 search strategies at EuPathDB32 were used to search for all T. annulata
protein-encoding genes with predicted signal peptides (SignalP 2.0). 689 genes were
returned. 138 of these were found to have a predicted SP only in T. annulata and not in their
T. gondii orthologs. Among these proteins, we excluded (i) hypothetical proteins, (ii)
proteins which are not expressed at the macroschizont stage, and (iii) proteins which are
predicted to be targeted to the apicoplast of the parasite. We obtained 33 proteins in
Extended Data Table 1. This search strategy was repeated on 4/22/2013 to ensure that results
were consistent with any EuPathDB updates. All 33 proteins from Extended Data Table 1
were returned in the updated search.

Homology models of TaPin1 WT and Mutant A53P were built with the online server
EsyPred33. The experimental structure of human Pin134 co-crystallized with a dipeptide
Ala-Pro (resolution 1.35 Å) was used as a template. In order to check the protonation state
of the protein titratable groups, we used our online server PCE35. The most likely binding
pocket areas for TaPin1 WT were predicted with FTMap and investigation of side chain
flexibility (if any) in the area of the predicted binding cavities was carried out with the
server FTFlex36. The 2D structures of Juglone, Buparvaquone and DTM were obtained from
PubChem and the 3D structures were generated with our package DG-AMMOS37. Three
docking tools, Surflex38, Molegro Virtual Docker39 and our tool MS-DOCK40 were used to
search for possible poses of these compounds in hPin1, for TaPin1 WT and Mutant A53P.
Calibration of our docking tools was performed on the thiol-stress sensing regulator cocrystallized with a quinone molecule, which in this structure is covalently attached to a Cys
residue (PDB file 4HQM)41. Visualization and figures were prepared with PyMol.

Extended Data Figure 6. The PPIase domain of Pin1 is well conserved

Author Manuscript

a. Sequence alignment of pin1 genes in H. sapiens, A. thaliana, T. brucei and T. annulata
revealed the presence or the absence of a conserved WW domain. Percentages of identity are
indicated. The magenta box indicates the predicted signal peptide of TaPin1.
b. Homology models for TaPin1 WT and Mutant A53P based on sequence identity/
similarity with hPin1. The mutation Ala>Pro in TaPin1 appears to induce a conformational
change within and nearby the catalytic loop.
c. The Buparvaquone molecule can be docked in the active site of hPin1 or in the active site
of WT TaPin1 predicted structure. Here, the second lowest docked energy pose is shown
(the best predicted energy pose is shown Fig. 3a). These two predicted binding poses are
fully consistent with the different binding modes of some inhibitors co-crystallized with
hPin1. Yet, considering computations shown below in Extended Data Fig. 6e, we suggest
that the most likely pose for Buparvaquone corresponds to the pose 1 reported in Fig 3a.

However, independently of the selected poses, we expect that Buparvaquone would not fit
well in the catalytic pocket due to structural changes induced by the A53P mutation.
d. 3D structure of the experimental hPin1 structure and the predicted TaPin1 WT, A53P
mutant, alongside Trypanosome TbPin1, Arabidopsis Pin1At models (ribbon diagram). The
3D structures are well conserved among these proteins with some differences, for instance,
in the catalytic loops. The TaPin1, TbPin1 and PinAt enzymes lack the WW domain present
in hPin1 yet the overall fold in the catalytic area is well-conserved suggesting that accurate
homology models for TaPin1 can be built using the approach used in the present study.
e. The experimental structure of hPin1 is represented as a solid surface with a view down the
active site, showing a small co-crystallized ligand next to the catalytic site residue Cys113.
In the same orientation, small chemical fragments are predicted to bind in the catalytic site
region with FTmap. Using this information, we propose that the most likely binding pose for
Buparvaquone is the one shown in Fig. 3.

Author Manuscript

a. Expression of Pin1 RNA in T. annulata-infected TBL3 cells, uninfected BL3 cells or T.
parva-infected TpMD409 cells, treated with Buparvaquone (Bup) or control (Con). Bovine
Pin1 expression was used as loading control.
b. TaPin1 protein was detected in the host cytoplasm and nucleus, in contrast Apicomplexan
actin (TaActin). Bovine Histone H3 (nuclear) and Tubulin (cytoplasmic) proteins were
controls. Relative quantification showing TaPin1/Tubulin or TaPin1/Histone H3 ratios
calculated with Image J software (average ± sd, n=3). The p-values were corrected for the
multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction based on the total overall number of
pairwise comparisons. *p<0.05, **p<0.01.
c. TaPin1 was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of infected cells by confocal
microscopy using an affinity-purified antibody specific for TaPin1, counterstaining with
DAPI (white arrows indicate parasites).
Results are representative of 3 independent experiments.

Fig. 3. Inhibition of TaPin1 activity blocks transformation in vitro and in vivo

Author Manuscript

a. Homology prediction models for TaPin1 and TaPin1-A53P Mutant based on similarity
with hPin1. The TaPin1-A53P mutation induces a conformational change near the catalytic
loop (green arrow). Computational analysis predicted docking of Juglone, Buparvaquone or
DTM molecules in the Pin1 active sites (see Extended Data Fig. 6c for alternative). Bup/Jug:
red=polar and negatively-charged residues; blue=polar and positively charged residues;
yellow= S atoms; white=remaining residues. DTM: blue = N atoms; amber = S atoms.
Colours in small molecule: O atoms in red; other atoms in yellow.
b. TaPin1 and TaPin1 A53P catalytic PPIase activity, measured in vitro chymotrypsincoupled assay, upon treatment with Buparvaquone (Bup), Juglone (Jug) or DTM. “Con”
indicates Control solutions.
c. Drug treatment (72h) eliminated Theileria parasites in infected cells (parasite nuclei
counted following DAPI staining).
d. Pin1 inhibitors decreased the viability of infected TBL3 cells (XTT assay 72h).
e. Drug treatment decreased colony formation of parasitized cells in soft-agar (72h treatment
with Buparvaquone (Bup), Juglone (Jug) or DTM): macroscopic colonies/plate after 10
days.

Fig. 4. TaPin1 activates the oncogenic c-Jun pathway via FBW7 ubiquitination

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

a. Endogenous TaPin1 interacts with FBW7α isoform. Protein extracts from TBL3
expressing Flag-hFBW7 isoforms or Flag-Control “Con” were immunoprecipitated and
immunoblotted with TaPin1 or Flag antibodies.
b. Inhibition of TaPin1 by Bup, Jug or DTM increased FBW7α protein levels and decreased
c-Jun expression in TBL3 cells. Actin/Tubulin were loading controls.
c. Inhibition of FBW7 increases c-Jun protein levels in TBL3 cells, whereas ectopic FBW7α
expression reduced c-Jun protein levels. Bovine actin/Tubulin were loading controls. Con =
empty vector.
d. Inhibition of Jun reporter activity (BIC promoter-Luciferase, an AP-1 target gene) in
TBL3 cells transfected with siRNA against FBW7 or siControl (siCon).
e. Jun reporter activity (BIC promoter-Luciferase) in TBL3 cells treated with Buparvaquone
(Bup) or Juglone (Jug) was rescued by siRNA against FBW7 but not siControl.
f. siFBW7 inhibition rescued drug effects on c-Jun ubiquitination in parasitized TBL3 cells,
incubated with MG132, followed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous c-Jun and
immunoblotting with c-Jun and ubiquitin antibodies. “Ig” = non-specific control
immunoglobulin.
g. siFBW7 depletion increased the half-life of endogenous c-Jun protein. TBL3 cells treated
with Buparvaquone (Bup) or Juglone (Jug) were incubated with cycloheximide, followed by
immunoblotting with c-Jun or Tubulin antibodies. Relative c-Jun protein levels at T0 were
set at 1.
