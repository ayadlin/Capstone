Abstract
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are necessary but insufficient causes of cervical cancers. Other risk
factors for cervical cancer (e.g., pregnancy, smoking, infections causing inflammation) can lead to high and sustained
nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in the cervix, and high NO
levels are related to carcinogenesis through DNA damage and
mutation. However, the effects of NO exposure in HPV-infected
cells have not been investigated. In this study, we used the NO
donor DETA-NO to model NO exposure to cervical epithelium.
In cell culture media, 24-hour exposure to 0.25 to 0.5 mmol/L
DETA-NO yielded a pathologically relevant NO concentration.
Exposure of cells maintaining episomal high-risk HPV
genomes to NO increased HPV early transcript levels 2- to
4-fold but did not increase viral DNA replication. Accompanying increased E6 and E7 mRNA levels were significant
decreases in p53 and pRb protein levels, lower apoptotic
indices, increased DNA double-strand breaks, and higher
mutation frequencies when compared with HPV-negative
cells. We propose that NO is a molecular cofactor with HPV
infection in cervical carcinogenesis, and that modifying
local NO cervical concentrations may constitute a strategy
whereby HPV-related cancer can be reduced. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women
worldwide, killing >200,000 women annually (1). Infections with
15 types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause virtually all
cases of cervical and other anogenital cancers (2). These
carcinogenic or ‘‘high-risk’’ HPVs include types 16, 18, 31, 33, and
51 (reviewed in ref. 3). HPVs are small DNA viruses with circular
genomes and have a strict tropism for squamous epithelial cells
(i.e., human keratinocytes). High-risk HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 are
main contributors to HPV-related cervical cancer, exerting their
functions, in part, by functionally inactivating tumor suppressor
proteins p53 and pRb, respectively. Yet, HPV infection in cervical
epithelium is an insufficient cause of cervical cancer, and
epidemiologic studies have revealed a number of risk factors.

These include tobacco smoking, multiparity, long-term use of oral
contraceptives, chronic inflammation, and other sexually transmitted infections [e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis and herpes simplex
virus type 2 (HSV-2); ref. 3]. Interestingly, these cofactors have the
common activity of increasing nitric oxide (NO) levels in the
cervical microenvironment (4–6), and increased NO levels and
markers of NO-mediated mutagenesis have recently been observed
in the cervixes of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN; refs. 7, 8).
NO is a free radical generated from L-arginine by various
NADPH-dependent enzymes called NO synthases (NOS; ref. 9). As a
free radical, NO gives rise to various reactive nitrogen species that
are important to its bioreactivity. High levels of NO and reactive
nitrogen species produced at infectious or inflammatory sites can
modify DNA bases in several ways, causing single- and doublestrand breaks (DSB) and DNA cross-linking (10). Reactive nitrogen
species can mediate G:C to T:A transversion by formation of 8nitroguanine, a potential mutagen (11). NO-dependent DNA
damage, mutagenic effects, and increased tumorigenesis have also
been reported in vivo in inflammatory and infectious models
wherein inducible NOS (iNOS) is induced or overexpressed (12–14).
In normal cells, high-level free radical damage can be genotoxic
leading to cell death through apoptosis or necrosis (15). Consistent
with this, high levels of NO are reported to activate the p53
pathway by inhibiting p53 nuclear export, hindering p53 degradation, and activating p53 by phosphorylation (16–18). In response to
DNA damage from genotoxic insults, p53 plays an important role in
maintaining genomic stability by initiating appropriate cell cycle
arrest, DNA repair, senescence, or apoptosis (19). Although high NO
concentrations can lead to apoptosis in cancer cell lines containing
wild-type p53, cells with mutant p53 or lacking p53 are resistant to
apoptosis on NO exposure (20). The majority of HPV-positive
cervical cancer cells have wild-type p53, yet they show very low p53
activity due to E6-mediated degradation (21). The ability of p53 to
maintain genomic stability in high-risk HPV–infected cells exposed
to NO is unknown. NO has various effects on virus infections
(reviewed in refs. 22, 23). It acts as an endogenous mutagen for
RNA viruses. NO inhibits the replication of certain DNA and RNA
viruses, yet others seem unaffected. However, the effect of NO on
the HPV life cycle has not been described.
In this report, we investigated the effects of physiologically high
NO doses on HPV-infected cells that normally maintain episomal
viral genomes. We found that HPV early gene transcription, but not
viral genome replication, increased in a NO-dose dependent
manner. The NO-related up-regulation of early oncogene E6
resulted in decreased p53 protein levels and activity. Similarly,
pRb levels were decreased coincident with HPV E7 transcript
induction. As expected from the loss of p53 activity in NO-exposed

HPV-infected cells, we detected significant DNA DSBs compared
with HPV-negative cells. Apoptosis levels were increased in HPVnegative cells but not in HPV-infected cells. Furthermore, mutation
frequencies were higher in surviving HPV-positive cells. These
results strongly suggest that physiologic doses of NO could
promote malignant progression of HPV-infected cells in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, NO exposure, survival, and toxicity. W12E and CIN-612
9E cell lines were established from human CIN-1 biopsies. W12E cells
express wild-type p53 and contain episomal HPV16 DNA (24). CIN-612 9E
cells maintain episomal HPV31 genomes (25). W12E and CIN-612 9E cells
were investigated at <20 passages (1:5 split) after cloning. C-33A is an HPVnegative human cervical carcinoma cell line that expresses mutant p53 (26).
Primary human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK) and NIKS cells (Stratatech), a
spontaneously immortalized HFK line, harbor wild-type p53 (27). W12E,
CIN-612 9E, HFK, and NIKS cells were cocultivated with mitomycin C–
treated J2/3T3 fibroblast feeders maintained in E medium containing 10%

fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/mL Nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich; ref. 28);
HFK and NIKS cells also required 10 ng/mL epithelial growth factor (SigmaAldrich). HaCaT, a spontaneously immortalized human epithelial cell line
established from normal adult skin, expresses mutant p53 (29). HaCaT cells
were maintained in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing
10% FBS, 4 amino acids, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 1 Ag/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). For NO donor treatment, cells
were seeded without fibroblast feeder cells to be 50% to 70% confluent after
16 to 20 h and then were incubated in fresh medium containing the NO
donor (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium1,2-diolate (DETA-NO) or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; Cayman
Chemicals). Cell culture supernatants were collected at indicated posttreatment time points. NO concentrations in supernatants were measured by
two independent methods. Electrochemical analysis was accomplished with
InNO Nitric Oxide Measuring System (Innovative Instruments, Inc.); the
Griess method (Promega) assayed stable NO metabolites NO2 and NO3 .
Trypan blue exclusion staining assessed cell numbers following 0, 12, and
24 h of DETA-NO donor treatment. Toxicity was measured as directed by
assay of lactate dehydogenase (LDH) in cell-free supernatants following
DETA-NO donor treatment (Sigma-Aldrich).
Nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative
PCR. Total cellular DNA was harvested as described (30). Total RNAs were
extracted from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and processed with the
TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion) to remove copurifying viral and cellular
DNA. Reverse transcription of total RNAs (0.2–0.5 Ag) was done as reported
(31). For quantitative PCR, 2 AL of each cDNA or total DNA were analyzed
in triplicate using the SYBR Green I kit on the iCycler (Bio-Rad). The
thermocycling profile was 1 min at 95jC, 40 cycles at 95jC for 30 s and
60jC for 30 s, 5 min at 72jC. Threshold cycle (C T) numbers were
determined using the iCycler IQ optical software (version 3.0a). PCR
primers, product length, and amplification efficiency are presented in
Supplementary Table S1. The efficiency of each amplification assay, using
10-fold serial pooled templates, was determined from respective templates
versus C T efficiency plots in Q-Gene software (32). Triplicate quantitative
PCR results from cDNA reactions were normalized to quantities of TATAbox binding protein (TBP) cDNA; DNA amplifications were normalized to
GADPH gene copies using Q-Gene software (32). Final results are averages
of three independent experiments, with Q test <0.94 and error bars
representing SE.
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in standard radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Proteins were quantified by Bradford assay, separated by
10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore). Membranes were probed with primary monoclonal antibodies
to p53 (Calbiochem) or pRb (Abcam), followed by secondary goat antimouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), and
developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce). To control protein loading,
membranes were stripped [62.5 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 6.8) 2% SDS, 100 mmol/
L 2-mercaptoethanol] at 50jC for 20 min and reprobed with anti–h-tubulin
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).
p53 activity. Cells were transfected with p53-luc, a p53 responsive
reporter (Stratagene), using the Keratinocyte Nucleofector Kit H (Amaxa).
p53-luc contains 13 copies of the p53 consensus sequence driving
expression of luciferase. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were refed with
fresh medium containing various DETA-NO concentrations for another
24 h; cells were harvested and luciferase activity was detected using the
Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
Neutral single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Neutral comet
assays were done according to Trevigen, Inc. instructions to assess NOinduced DNA DSBs. Briefly, cells were combined with molten agarose and
lysed. Electrophoresis was done in 1 Tris-borate EDTA for 10 min at 1 V/
cm and stained with SYBR Green I. Photography was done using a Zeiss
fluorescence microscope and analyzed with Comet Assay Software Project
(CASP). Olive tail moment (OTM), defined as the product of distance (in x
direction) between the comet head center of gravity (CGH) and the tail
center of gravity (CGT), accounting for the percent tail DNA (DNAT)
wherein OTM = (CGTx
CGHx) / %DNAT, was determined for at least
80 cells per sample (33).

Apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with
Annexin V-phycoerythrin kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. By fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, Annexin
V-phycoerythrin fluorescence was recorded in FL-2 and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) in FL-3. Apoptotic cells were labeled with only Annexin V,
necrotic cells with both Annexin V and 7-AAD, and living cells were negative
for both.
Mutagenesis. NO-treated cells (24 h) were grown with feeder cells for
6 to 10 d without NO exposure to allow phenotypic expression and then
plated in selective medium without feeder cells for 6-thioguanineR (6-TGR)
selection to indicate mutation in the HPRT locus. Cells from each treatment
were also plated in the absence of selective drug to determine plating
efficiency (PE). Triplicates were investigated for each experimental group.
After 2 wk, colonies were counted and the mutation frequency was
calculated [mutation frequency = number of colonies / (number of seeded
cells  PE)  106 cells]. Parallel control experiments assayed cellular
mutation response to 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO; 140 ng/mL for
1.5 h), a well-characterized mutagen.
Statistics. Statistical significance of differences in response was
evaluated using the nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Tests of
linear trend were conducted using the Wald statistic by linear regression
modeling the ordered DETA-NO concentrations as a continuous variable.
Correlation between HPV E6 expression and p53 activity was calculated
using Pearson’s correlation. P V 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical
analyses for E6/E7 gene expression and p53 activity, as well as the respective
correlations, were done using Stata version 10. All other statistical analyses
were done using SigmaStat.

Results
Physiologically relevant, high concentrations of NO are
nontoxic to cervical epithelial cells. To study the effects of
physiologically relevant cervical NO concentrations on HPVinfected cells, we quantified NO production from different
concentrations of NO donors SNAP or DETA-NO in cell culture
media after 24-hour exposure. NO production correlated with NO
donor concentrations; dose-dependent increases in nitrite were
detected from each donor and are consistent with other reports (4).
At equivalent concentrations, DETA-NO generated more NO than
did SNAP (Fig. 1A). Measurements of actual NO concentrations
from 0.125 and 0.5 mmol/L of DETA-NO using an NO-specific
electrode indicated relatively constant NO concentrations of 150
and 400 nmol/L (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous reports (34, 35).
NO concentrations produced from 0.125 and 0.5 mmol/L of DETANO were comparable to those produced in vivo at sites of colonic
crypt inflammation and airway inflammation (34, 36) and detected
in cervical samplings during pregnancy (37).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

On decomposition, DETA-NO releases NO and a parent amine,
diethylenetriamine (DETA). Therefore, to control for potential
biological effects in our assays, we tested the consequences of
different DETA-NO concentrations as well as 1 mmol/L DETA on
cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. DETA exposure did not affect
cell proliferation, whereas DETA-NO treatment (0.25–1.0 mmol/L)
resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 1C).
Neither DETA-NO nor DETA was cytotoxic to CIN-612 9E cells
except at the highest DETA-NO dose (1 mmol/L; Fig. 1D). W12E, C33A, and HFK cells responded similarly in cell proliferation assays
to 0.125 to 0.5 mmol/L of DETA-NO, and no cytotoxicity was
associated with these exposure doses (not shown).
NO exposure increases HPV early viral transcription but has
no effect on viral genome levels. NO has inhibitory effects on
replication of the DNA viruses HSV-2 (4) and hepatitis B virus
(HBV; ref. 38). In high-risk HPVs, the E1, E2, E6, and E7 gene
products have roles in viral genome replication and maintenance
(30, 39, 40). Because NO also stimulates p53 accumulation (16),
which could affect E6 protein functions, we hypothesized that NO
exposure might inhibit HPV replication. We designed quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR assays
to assess the effect of elevated NO levels on viral transcription and
replication in HPV-infected cells. HPV16-positive W12E and
HPV31-positive CIN-612 9E cell lines maintain episomal viral
genomes, and we used direct automated sequencing from cDNA to
verify wild-type p53 coding regions in both cell lines (not shown).
Cells were exposed to 0 to 0.5 mmol/L of DETA-NO or 0.5 mmol/L
of DETA alone as a control. After 24 hours of NO exposure, total
RNA and DNA were harvested for quantification of HPV early viral
transcripts and genome copies. TBP cDNA and the GADPH gene
were targeted as internal controls in quantitative RT-PCR and
quantitative PCR assays, respectively. Exposure to increasing NO
concentrations resulted in dose-dependent increases in E6, E7,
E1^E4, and E6* RNAs in both HPV16- and HPV31-infected cells
(Fig. 2). Compared with the unexposed control group, the increase
in E1^E4 transcript levels was statistically significant as DETA-NO
dose reached 0.25 mmol/L; at 0.5 mmol/L, HPV16 E1^E4 increased
2.9-fold and HPV31 E1^E4 increased 3.2-fold. The E6*, E6, and E7
transcript increases were statistically significant at 0.5 mmol/L
DETA-NO exposure: HPV16 E6, 1.9-fold; E7, 2.4-fol; and E6*,
2.6-fold, respectively, and HPV31 E6, 2.2-fold; E7, 2.3-fold; and E6*,
2.6-fold, respectively. The E7 coding region is contained in all early
transcripts, including those with the unspliced E6 open reading
frame and RNAs with the spliced E6* form (see Supplementary
Fig. S1). Therefore, the levels of E7 transcripts should generally

represent the sum of E6 and E6* RNAs, and our results are
consistent with this (Fig. 2). The DETA control had no effect on
viral mRNA transcription. The increase in viral early transcription
was not due to increased viral genome copy number because none
of the treatments altered HPV genome levels in the cells (Fig. 2).
These data show that exposure of HPV-infected cervical cells to
physiologic levels of NO results in increased HPV early viral
transcription without affecting viral genome replication.
Early viral transcription increases coincide with p53 and
pRb degradation. Low expression levels and lack of effective
antibodies to HPV early proteins prompted us to evaluate
downstream effects of increased viral early protein expression.
High-risk HPV E6 oncoprotein induces proteasomal degradation of
p53 (41). The E7 oncoprotein binds and degrades pRb and related
family members p107 and p130 (42). Therefore, to investigate
whether the increase in HPV E6 and E7 RNAs induced by NO
exposure resulted in higher levels of viral oncoproteins, we assayed
for p53 and pRb protein levels in treated HPV-infected cells by
immunoblot. Results showed dose-dependent decreases in wildtype p53 levels in HPV-positive W12E and CIN-612 9E cells after
DETA-NO treatment (Fig. 3A). However, consistent with previous
reports, in low-passage HFK cells that carry wild-type p53 genes,
DETA-NO treatment caused increased p53 levels. No obvious
change in p53 levels was observed in HPV-negative cells expressing
mutant p53 (C-33A and HaCaT cells; Fig. 3A). Similarly, pRb levels
were reduced in HPV-infected cells, but were unaffected in
keratinocytes lacking HPV (Fig. 3C).
Because p53 protein levels do not always correlate with p53
activity, we assayed for p53 transcriptional activity by transfecting
a p53-reponsive reporter into cells before NO exposure. Wild-type
p53 activity was reduced in HPV-infected cells following NO

exposure in a manner consistent with increased HPV E6 expression
and the corresponding decrease in p53 levels (Fig. 3B). A significant
negative correlation was observed between HPV E6 transcript level
and p53 activity in both W12E (P = 0.02) and CIN-612 9E cells
(P = 0.005). In HPV-negative HFKs harboring wild-type p53, NO
exposure increased p53 transcriptional activity concomitant with
increased p53 protein levels as expected. The activity of mutant p53
was unaffected in NO-exposed C-33A and HaCaT cells.
NO induces DNA DSBs in HPV-infected cells. NO exposure
causes DNA DSBs, the most cytotoxic lesions, in mammalian cells
(43, 44). Given that p53 functions are inactivated in HPV-infected
cells exposed to NO, we hypothesized that DSBs would be more
pronounced in HPV-positive cells compared with uninfected
normal HFK after NO exposure. DNA DSBs were evaluated in
W12E, CIN-612 9E, HFK, and C-33A cells using the neutral comet
assay after 24-hour exposure to increasing concentrations of DETANO. DNA tail moments were greater in each of the four groups of
cells after NO exposure; however, NO-induced tail moments in
W12E and CIN-612 9E cells were significantly higher than those in
normal HFK cells (Fig. 4 A and B). As expected, the tail moments
were the greatest in C-33A cells, expressing mutant p53, with even
the untreated cells showing comet tail moments longer than those
in other untreated cells.
In normal mammalian cells, extreme cellular stress and
genotoxicity induce p53 expression to trigger either DNA repair
or apoptotic cell death as a protective mechanism. To determine
whether apoptosis was involved in the NO-related DNA damage in
HPV-infected cells, Annexin V and 7-AAD staining was used. There
were significant increases in the percentage of apoptotic HFK cells
in response to DNA DSB induced after treatment with 0.25 mmol/L
(P < 0.05) and 0.5 mmol/L (P < 0.01) of DETA-NO (Fig. 4C). Although

there was slightly higher cell death in HPV-infected cells after
DETA-NO treatment, the increase was not statistically significant.
Likewise, NO-induced DSBs were not associated with greater cell
death in C-33A cancer cells containing mutant p53. Therefore, NO
exposure caused more DSBs in HPV-infected cells; yet, the
suppressed p53 activity was unable to trigger the normal apoptotic
cell death response pathways.
DNA mutations accumulate in HPV-infected cells exposed
to NO. DSB-DNA damage repair is error-prone and increases the
likelihood of DNA mutations. Because p53 is thought to be involved
in the repair process and our data show decreased normal apoptosis
functions, we assayed mutation accumulation in NO-exposed HPVinfected cells. Because it is difficult to sustain low-passage HFK cells
for more than 10 passages, we used a spontaneously immortalized
clone of HFKs, NIKS cells, as our uninfected cell line. NIKS cells
displayed similar characteristics as HFKs in p53 activity and DNA
damage following NO exposure (data not shown). The cell lines were
differentially sensitive to 6-TG: Whereas spontaneous (0 mmol/L
DETA-NO) 6-TGR mutation frequencies in W12E and CIN-612 9E
were similar to those in NIKS cells, the C-33A carcinoma cells

showed 2.4-fold higher (P < 0.01) spontaneous mutation frequency
than NIKS cells (Table 1). After 24-hour treatment with 0.25 and
0.5 mmol/L of DETA-NO, we detected 2.6-fold (P < 0.01) and 8.8-fold
(P < 0.01) increases of 6-TGR mutation frequencies in W12E cells
and 2.2-fold (P < 0.05) and 7.0-fold (P < 0.01) increases in CIN-612 9E
cells as compared with their untreated (0 mmol/L) control groups.
However, HPV-negative NIKS cells treated with 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/L
of DETA-NO had smaller increases in mutation frequencies
(1.8-fold, P > 0.05 and 2.4-fold, P < 0.05). C-33A carcinoma cells
had significantly higher mutation frequencies at 3.3-fold (P < 0.01)
and 9.5-fold (P < 0.01), respectively. As a positive control, mutagen
4-NQO induced 6-TGR mutations at frequencies significantly higher
in W12E, CIN-612 9E, and C-33A cells than in NIKS cells when
compared at the same dose levels. Therefore, NO exposure results
in higher DNA mutation frequencies in HPV-infected cells, a
phenotype related to the lower p53 activity in these cells.

Natural history studies indicate that nearly every sexually active
woman will acquire at least one cervical high-risk HPV infection
over the course of their lives, yet relatively few will progress to
cancer. Expression of high-risk HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes predispose infected cells to cancer, in part, by functional inactivation of two critical tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and pRb,
respectively. Whereas E6/E7 expression is sufficient for immortalization, it is insufficient for transformation in vitro, suggesting that
exogenous factors are required for further progression toward
tumorigenesis (reviewed in ref. 3).
Many putative cofactors for HPV-induced cervical cancer have
been identified through epidemiologic case-control studies, including tobacco smoke, high parity, inflammation, and coinfection with
Chlamydia or HSV-2. We noted that all of these exposures could
lead to increased cervical NO levels either directly (e.g., tobacco
smoke metabolites) or indirectly through the local induction of

Nitric Oxide Mutagenesis in HPV-Infected Cells

iNOS in the cervical epithelium or resident macrophages and other
innate immune cells. We reasoned that sustained NO in the
microenvironment of high-risk HPV-infected cells could promote
tumorigenesis resulting from E6-mediated loss of p53 response to
NO-induced genotoxic stress. Whereas there is some evidence for
increased NO levels or NO-associated mutagenesis (e.g., formation
of 8-nitroguanine) in the cervixes of women with CIN relative to
controls (7, 8), the in vitro effect of physiologically relevant doses of
NO on HPV-infected cells maintaining episomal viral genomes has
not been determined.
We did not observe any NO effect on HPV episomal genome
replication; however, we did see a statistically significant dosedependent increase in HPV early E6, E7, E6*, and E1^E4 mRNA
expression in both HPV16- and HPV31-containing cells. This
contrasts with antiviral NO effects on other DNA viruses, such as
HSV-2 and HBV, and some RNA viruses (22, 23). The mechanism
underlying stimulation of HPV gene expression in response to NO
exposures is under investigation. NO can affect the activities of
activator protein 1, Sp-1, and nuclear factor-nB transcription
factors (45) known to regulate HPV gene expression (46, 47).
Interestingly, HPV16 E6/E7–expressing keratinocytes show substantial iNOS down-regulation (48). Although this may have evolved
primarily as a means of immune escape, it supports the notion that
a microenvironment enriched in diffusible NO could be detrimental to a normal, nonpathogenic HPV life cycle.
Regardless of the mechanism by which NO affects HPV gene
expression, the functional consequence of up-regulation of HPV E6
and E7 oncoproteins is decreased levels of p53 and pRb. Although
cells infected with HPV16 and HPV31 show residual p53 activity
and detectable p53 and pRb proteins under basal conditions,
increased E6 and E7 expression following NO exposure positively
correlated with significant reductions in pRb levels and both p53
protein levels and activity. Conversely, uninfected HFKs expressing
wild-type p53 showed marked p53 protein accumulation and
increased p53 activity following NO exposure, consistent with a
normal NO-induced genotoxic stress response.
We directly examined the effect of NO on genome integrity in
HPV-infected and uninfected cells because many studies have found

increases in DSBs and mutation in response to NO exposure in cells
lacking functional tumor suppressor pathways (17, 18). As expected,
we observed a dose-dependent increase in DNA DSBs and mutation
frequency in HPV-positive cells exhibiting decreased p53 levels and
activity after NO exposure. More importantly, we saw minimal
apoptosis in response to the NO-induced genotoxicity in the HPVinfected cells, in contrast to the NO dose–dependent increase in
apoptosis observed in the uninfected HFKs. Together, our observations suggest that physiologically relevant, high NO exposure results
in survival of HPV-infected cells harboring serious DNA damage.
Cervical cancer and its precursors are characterized by
significant genetic damage (3). However, this is a rare outcome of
typical HPV infections, and mechanisms leading to accumulated
genomic instability in HPV-infected cells have remained elusive.
Our approach to identify possible sources of genomic instability
was to look for pathways common to epidemiologically identified
cervical cancer cofactors. One such common pathway is increased
NO exposure in the cervix. Whereas there are no reports describing
cervical NO measurements over serial times or extended periods in
patients, except during pregnancy and delivery (49), NO levels are
high at various time points in vivo, as discussed above. NO levels
modeled here are primarily produced in vivo by iNOS, whose
expression is tightly regulated under normal conditions. Toxicity is
related to NO concentration and exposure dosages as a function of
time in vitro (50, 51). Effects are insignificant if neither or only one
threshold is exceeded; when both are exceeded, toxicity directly
correlates with dosage increase. In studying physiologically
relevant, high NO concentrations (150–400 nmol/L), we found
significant toxicity with 24-hour exposure to z200 nmol/L NO,
suggesting that the concentration and exposure time exceeded
both thresholds. Presumably, longer NO exposures in vivo would
increase toxicity risk (DNA damage and mutation), possibly due
to dysregulated iNOS expression. Yet, it is unknown whether
procarcinogenic responses in vivo result from transiently high NO
concentrations or constitutive iNOS activation.
We confirm that cells infected with carcinogenic HPV types
respond to high NO exposures with decreased p53 and pRb levels,
DNA damage and mutation, and inappropriate survival, suggesting

Figure 5. Model for HPV and NO
interaction in cervical cancer progression.
Infection with high-risk (HR ) HPVs is a
necessary but insufficient cause of
cervical cancer (right ). Epidemiologically
defined cofactors (boxed ), including
C. trachomatis and HSV-2 infections,
chronic inflammation, long-term oral
contraceptive (OC ) use, multiparity, and
tobacco smoking, increase NO levels in
the cervical microenvironment. Most of
these factors cause increased iNOS
expression in cervical epithelium or
tissue macrophages, whereas some
(e.g., tobacco smoke) contain NO.
Similar to the work of others, we find
that in normal cells, NO induces high
p53 levels leading to DNA repair or
apoptosis wherein mutant cells generally
fail to survive. However, in high-risk
HPV–infected cells, NO causes increased
early mRNA expression, decreased pRb
and p53 levels, low p53 activity and
apoptotic indices, and increased survival
of mutant cells. These data are consistent
with NO as a molecular cofactor with
HPV infection in cervical carcinogenesis.

that NO exposure is a biologically plausible molecular cofactor in
HPV-mediated carcinogenesis. Thus, we propose a cervical cancer
model (Fig. 5) wherein cofactor exposure can result in increases
in cervical NO levels precipitating a chain of procarcinogenic
events. This experimental model provides the impetus for
expanded epidemiologic studies of cervical NO expression to
better understand the in vivo exposure variability as it relates to
HPV infection and risk of CIN. Support for this model by future
studies would advocate potential therapeutic effects of pharmacologic decreases in cervical NO levels.
