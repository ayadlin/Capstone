Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is an integral membrane, scaffolding protein found in plasma membrane invaginations (caveolae). Cav1 regulates
multiple cancer-associated processes. In breast cancer, a tumor suppressive role for Cav1 has been suggested; however, Cav1 is
frequently overexpressed in aggressive breast cancer subtypes, suggesting an oncogenic function in advanced-stage disease. To
further delineate Cav1 function in breast cancer progression, we evaluated its expression levels among a panel of cell lines
representing a spectrum of breast cancer phenotypes. In basal-like (the most aggressive BC subtype) breast cancer cells, Cav1 was
consistently upregulated, and positively correlated with increased cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and migration
and invasion. To identify mechanisms of Cav1 gene regulation, we compared DNA methylation levels within promoter ‘CpG islands’
(CGIs) with ‘CGI shores’, recently described regions that ﬂank CGIs with less CG-density. Integration of genome-wide DNA
methylation proﬁles (‘methylomes’) with Cav1 expression in 30 breast cancer cell lines showed that differential methylation of CGI
shores, but not CGIs, signiﬁcantly regulated Cav1 expression. In breast cancer cell lines having low Cav1 expression (despite
promoter CGI hypomethylation), we found that treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor induced Cav1 expression via CGI
shore demethylation. In addition, further methylome assessments revealed that breast cancer aggressiveness associated with Cav1
CGI shore methylation levels, with shore hypermethylation in minimally aggressive, luminal breast cancer cells and shore
hypomethylation in highly aggressive, basal-like cells. Cav1 CGI shore methylation was also observed in human breast tumors, and
overall survival rates of breast cancer patients lacking estrogen receptor a (ERa) negatively correlated with Cav1 expression. Based
on this ﬁrst study of Cav1 (a potential oncogene) CGI shore methylation, we suggest this phenomenon may represent a new
prognostic marker for ERa-negative, basal-like breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is a ubiquitous scaffolding protein that coats
plasma membrane invaginations termed caveolae in various cell
types.1 A variety of proteins have been identiﬁed to interact with
Cav1,2 suggesting that Cav1 functions as a ‘molecular hub’ to
integrate the activity of multiple signaling molecules, including
Src-family tyrosine kinases, growth factor receptors (epidermal
growth factor receptor), G protein and G-protein-coupled
receptors, and H-Ras.3–6 Interactions with the Cav1-scaffolding
domain anchor these proteins in a restrained conformation,
negatively regulating their activities.7 In addition, locus D7S522 of
human chromosome 7q31.1, the location of the Cav1 gene, is
frequently deleted in human cancers,8 further implicating Cav1 as
a tumor suppressor. However, Cav1 upregulation has been

observed in a variety of human cancers,9 and Cav1 expression is
a predictive marker of poor prognosis in cancer patients.10
Furthermore, Cav1 upregulation has been correlated with
metastatic potential11–13 and multidrug resistance.14,15 Thus,
depending on the cellular context, Cav1 may also function as an
oncogene.10
In breast cancer, Cav1 downregulation (compared with normal
tissue) was observed, demonstrating an inverse correlation between
Cav1 expression and tumor size,16,17 and loss of Cav1 expression was
associated with tamoxifen resistance.18 Conversely, Cav1 was
overexpressed in a subset of aggressive breast carcinomas,19
including subsets of basal-like and metaplastic tumors and
inﬂammatory breast cancers.20 In breast cancer cell culture
models, Cav1 downregulation was characteristic of luminal breast

cancer cells; in contrast, basal-like cells displayed overexpression of
Cav1.21–23 Despite these numerous observations, the role of Cav1 in
breast cancer, and the mechanism(s) that regulates its diverse
patterns of expression, remain to be fully established. To identify
Cav1 gene regulatory mechanisms, we examined epigenetic
changes associated with Cav1 expression in breast cancer.
Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, histone
modiﬁcations and nucleosome remodeling, are now considered
hallmarks of all stages of cancer development.24 DNA methylation,
in the context of CpG dinucleotides, has profound effects on gene
expression by inﬂuencing the accessibility of transcription factors
to DNA, altering genetic stability and modifying genomic
structure.25,26 Speciﬁcally, DNA methylation of promoter CpG
islands (CGIs) results in transcriptional silencing, and its
dysregulation has an important role in oncogenesis and tumor
progression.24 However, as only about 70% of human genes
contain a promoter CGI27 and only 6.8% of CpGs reside within
CGIs,28 many potentially informative CpG sites remain to be
examined. Recent work has shown that DNA methylation can
directly silence genes with non-CGI promoters and contribute to
the establishment of tissue-speciﬁc methylation patterns.29
Furthermore, tissue- and cancer-speciﬁc differentially methylated
regions occur more frequently within CGI shores, regions of
relatively low CpG density that ﬂank traditional CGIs (upto 2 kb
distant), than within CGIs themselves,30,31 suggesting the
involvement of CGI shore methylation in tissue differentiation,
epigenetic reprogramming and cancer.
In this study, using a panel of cell lines representing a spectrum
of breast cancer phenotypes, we demonstrated dramatic upregulation and an oncogenic role for Cav1 in estrogen receptor a
(ERa)-negative, basal-like cells, in which Cav1 supported cell
proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration and
invasion. To identify gene regulatory mechanism for Cav1, we
investigated DNA methylation levels within the Cav1 promoter
CGI and CGI shores. Differential CGI shore methylation strongly
associated with Cav1 expression, a ﬁnding further conﬁrmed in a
panel of 30 breast cancer cell lines using methyl-CpG binding
domain protein sequencing.32 The methylome analysis further
indicated an association between more aggressive breast cancer
subtypes and Cav1 CGI shore hypermethylation. In addition,
variable Cav1 CGI shore methylation was also observed in human
breast tumors and overall survival rates of breast cancer patients
lacking ERa negatively correlated with Cav1 expression. Based on
this ﬁrst report of CGI shore methylation of a potential oncogene,
we suggest that Cav1 CGI shore methylation may represent a new
prognostic marker for ERa-negative, basal-like breast cancer.

RESULTS
Oncogenic role of Cav1 in ERa-negative, basal-like breast cancer cells
Cav1 expression levels were examined in a panel of breast cancer
cell lines representing several disease subtypes (Figure 1a),
including luminal antiestrogen-sensitive MCF7 and BT-474, basallike antiestrogen-resistant MDA-MB-231 and two antiestrogenresistant MCF7-sublines, MCF7-F and MCF7-T.33 MCF7-F, derived
from MCF7, is resistant to both fulvestrant (a selective estrogen
receptor downregulator) and tamoxifen (a selective estrogen
receptor modulator) and have an ERa-negative and basal-like
phenotype. MCF7-T is resistant to tamoxifen, but not to
fulvestrant, and maintains an ERa-positive and luminal
phenotype. Consistent with a previous report,21 Cav1 mRNA
levels were higher (Po0.01) in MDA-MB-231 cells than in MCF7
and BT-474 (Figure 1a). MCF7-T cells displayed decreased (2.5-fold,
Po0.01) Cav1 expression, relative to its MCF7 parental cells,
agreeing with a previous report.18 However, Cav1 expression in
MCF7-F cells was increased 4-fold (Po0.01) as compared with its
parental MCF7 cells. Analysis of whole transcriptome RNA-seq data
Oncogene (2013) 4519 – 4528

of MCF7, MCF7-T and MCF7-F cells conﬁrmed this pattern of Cav1
expression (Supplementary Figure S1). Cav1 protein expression
patterns, assessed by immunoﬂuorescence staining, were similar
to the mRNA expression patterns of Cav1 in these cell lines
(Figure 1b).
To examine whether the distinct expression patterns of Cav1 in
MCF7-T and MCF7-F were due to drug treatment, we investigated
the effect of these drugs on endogenous Cav1 expression. The
parental MCF7 cells were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen or
fulvestrant for 8 days and Cav1 mRNA level was examined at the
indicated time points. 4-hydroxytamoxifen repressed Cav1 expression (Po0.01, after day 2); however, no effect of fulvestrant on
Cav1 levels was observed (Figure 1c). These results suggest that
tamoxifen treatment may initially induce loss of Cav1 expression
during the development of tamoxifen resistance, however,
elevated Cav1 levels in fulvestrant resistant MCF7-F cells may
result from long-term genetic and epigenetic alterations during
the drug treatment and cell subtype transition (from luminal to
basal).
To examine whether Cav1 expression directly associates with
fulvestrant resistance, we ectopically overexpressed Cav1 in
fulvestrant-sensitive MCF7 and MCF7-T cells, followed by fulvestrant treatment for 7 days. As expected, fulvestrant inhibited the
growth of control MCF7 and MCF7-T cells (vector, empty vectortransfected) (Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure S2). Although
the growth rate of Cav1-overexpressing cells was slightly reduced,
compared with control cells when treated with DMSO, these cells
were similarly growth-inhibited by fulvestrant, indicating that
Cav1 alone could not confer resistance to this selective estrogen
receptor downregulator (Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure S2).
Furthermore, we examined cell response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen
and concluded that Cav1 overexpression did not change cell
sensitivity to the selective estrogen receptor modulator either
(Supplementary Figure S3).
As MCF7-F cells showed increased clonogenicity,33 and
migration/invasion activity (Supplementary Figure S4) as compared with MCF7 and MCF7-T, we next assessed whether Cav1
expression contributed to the more aggressive basal-like phenotype. Ectopic Cav1 overexpression did not enhance clonogenic
activity of MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure S5a) and in fact
decreased clonogenicity of MCF7-T cells (Supplementary Figure
S5b). Elevated Cav1 expression signiﬁcantly inhibited migration
and invasion activity of MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure S6a),
while slightly increased invasiveness of MCF7-T cells
(Supplementary Figure S6b). Therefore, overexpression of Cav1
was not sufﬁcient to drive the more aggressive phenotype.
However small interfering-mediated knockdown of Cav1 in
MCF7-F cells signiﬁcantly decreased cell proliferation (Figure 1e)
and clonogenic activity (Figure 1f), as well as cell migration and
invasion (Figure 1g). Similar results were also observed in MDAMB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure S7). These results suggest
that Cav1 expression is associated with breast cancer subtype and
that this scaffolding protein has an oncogenic role in ERanegative, basal-like breast cancer cells.
Direct role for CGI shore methylation in Cav1 gene expression
Although Cav1 has been reported to be upregulated by the DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-CdR in prostate, lung and
ovarian cancers,34–36 hypermethylation of the Cav1 promoter
CGI in human cancer appears to be rare, at only 6% of cervical37
and 3.8% of colorectal cancers,38 and entirely absent in primary
ovarian tumors.39 To further investigate the role of DNA
methylation in Cav1 expression, we treated breast cancer cell
lines displaying low Cav1 expression (MCF7, MCF7-T and BT-474)
with 5-aza-CdR for 6 days. Although Cav1 mRNA levels increased
(Po0.01) in all three cell lines (Figure 2a), that increase was not
due to altered methylation of the Cav1 promoter CGI, which is

constitutively hypomethylated, determined by both methylationspeciﬁc PCR and bisulﬁte sequencing (Figures 2b and c) Only
sporadic methylation was observed in BT-474 cells, which had the
lowest Cav1 expression. In contrast, methylation of the CpG sites
located upstream of the Cav1 CGI (a ‘50 -CGI shore’),30 was
apparent (Figures 2b and d). Moreover, after 5-aza-CdR treatment,
decreased Cav1 CGI shore methylation was observed (Figure 2d),
indicating an association between shore methylation and
expression.
To further investigate the relationship between Cav1 methylation and expression, we quantiﬁed Cav1 CGI and CGI shore DNA
methylation levels by pyrosequencing, a fully quantitative
methylation assessment, in the panel of antiestrogen-sensitive
and -resistant cell lines displaying differential Cav1 expression
levels (Figure 1a). Seven pairs of primers were designed to amplify
different regions of Cav1, covering 10 and 18 CpG sites in the CGI
shore and CGI, respectively (Supplementary Figure S8 and
Supplementary Table S1). The analysis of individual CpG sites
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

conﬁrmed that the Cav1 CGI was hypomethylated in all cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S9; summarized in Figure 3a). However,
50 -CGI shore methylation was decreased in the aggressive MDAMB-231 and MCF7-F cells (median 2.7%, Po0.05 and median 9.6%,
Po0.01, respectively), but not in less aggressive MCF7, MCF7-T
and BT-474 (median 21.1%, 38.6% and 54.6%, respectively).
Furthermore, 30 -CGI shore methylation inversely correlated with
Cav1 expression in all these cell lines, with the lowest methylation
level observed in MDA-MB-231 cells (median 2.9%, Po0.01
compared with all other cell lines), decreased (Po0.01) 30 -CGI
shore methylation in MCF7-F cell (median 24.3%) and increased
(Po0.01) 30 -CGI shore methylation in MCF7-T cells (median 64.2%)
compared with MCF7 (median 42.1%). The highest (Po0.01) level
of 30 -CGI shore methylation was observed in BT-474 cells (median
69.5% vs other cell lines except MCF7-T).

inﬂuenced Cav1 gene expression, Cav1-low expressing cell lines

subjected to pyrosequencing analysis. 5-aza-CdR decreased
50 - and 30 -CGI shore methylation levels in MCF7-T cells by an
average of 56% (change from 39% to 17.1%) and 45% (change
from 63 to 35%) (Po0.01), respectively (Supplementary Figure
S10; summarized in Figure 3b). Similar results were observed in
MCF7 and BT-474 cells (Supplementary Figure S11). However,
when MCF7-F cells, which have low Cav1 CGI shore methylation,
were treated with 5-aza-CdR, Cav1 expression was only slightly
increased (B1.8-fold, Supplementary Figure S12), compared with
Cav1-low expressing cell lines (Figure 2a). Taken together, these
results support a direct regulatory role of CGI shore methylation in
Cav1 expression in breast cancer cells.
In addition, according to our bisulﬁte sequencing and
pyrosequencing results, we did not observe any mutations in
the Cav1 promoter CGI and CGI shores. Together with a recent
study reporting lack of Cav1 gene mutations in human breast
cancer,40 the differential Cav1 expression and CGI shore
methylation seems unlikely to be associated with DNA mutation.
Subtype-speciﬁc, Cav1 CpG island shore methylation patterns in
breast cancer cell lines
To investigate whether CGI shore methylation is a common
mechanism that regulates Cav1 expression, we performed
Oncogene (2013) 4519 – 4528

genome-wide proﬁling of DNA methylation using methyl-CpG
binding domain protein sequencing (see methods) on 30 breast
cancer cell lines. The breast cancer cell lines were divided into two
groups, ‘Cav1-low’ (12 luminal subtype and 3 basal A subtype) and
‘Cav1-high’ (15 basal subtype), based on our previous ﬁndings.21
The DNA methylation landscapes of these cell lines indicated that
Cav1 promoter CGI was hypomethylated in almost all cell lines,
regardless of Cav1-expression level. However, hypermethylation of
Cav1 CGI shores was observed mostly in Cav1-low lines (Figure 4).
A summary of DNA methylation around the Cav1 promoter CGI
for luminal and basal subtype cells is shown in Figure 5a. DNA
methylation in luminal/Cav1-low cells demonstrated two major
peaks at the CGI shore regions and a sub-peak at the CGI; in
contrast, the two major DNA methylation peaks at the CGI shore
were dramatically lower in basal/Cav1-high lines. By integrating
the methylome data with Cav1 mRNA expression proﬁles, we
found that CGI shore methylation within 500 bp of CGI showed a
strong negative correlation with Cav1 expression (ro  0.7), while
a weak negative correlation (r4  0.6) was seen for CGI
methylation or CGI shore methylation within 2 kb of the CGI
(Figure 5b). These ﬁndings indicate that Cav1 CGI shore
hypermethylation is a common event in luminal breast cancer
and strongly associates with Cav1 gene repression. As Cav1
expression strongly associates with the basal-like subtype, we

Cav1 methylation and expression in breast tumors from breast
cancer patients
To investigate whether Cav1 CGI shore methylation also occurs in
human breast tumors, we performed genome-wide proﬁling of

DNA methylation on 77 breast tumors (50 ERa-positive and
27 ERa-negative, Supplementary Table S2) and 10 normal breast
tissues. In normal breast tissues, hypomethylation of both Cav1
CGI and CGI shores was observed (Figure 7), consistent with
previously reported high Cav1 expression in normal breast
tissues.16,17 The majority of ERa-positive tumors displayed
hypermethylation of the Cav1 30 CGI shore, varied methylation
of 50 -CGI shore, and sporadic hypermethylation of Cav1 CGI

between Cav1 expression and methylation on CGI, CGI shore within 500 bp, and CGI shore within 2 kb. All three correlations were significantly
negative (Po0.05), but only methylation of CGI shore within 500 bp showed a strong negative association with Cav1 expression (ro  0.7).

(Figure 6). In the ERa-negative tumors, Cav1 promoter CGI
hypomethylation was apparent, but shore methylation varied
among the individual samples (Figure 6). Statistical analysis
conﬁrmed hypomethylation of Cav1 CGI in both ERa-positive
and -negative breast tumors, although ERa-positive tumors had
signiﬁcantly higher methylation levels (median 0.1 vs 0, P ¼ 0.009,
Figure 7). Cav1 50 -CGI shore methylation levels were variable, with
no difference between ERa-positive and -negative tumors
(P ¼ 0.64, Figure 7). However, Cav1 30 -CGI shore was heavily
methylated and the methylation levels were signiﬁcantly higher in
ERa-positive tumors (P ¼ 0.045, Figure 7). Owing to lack of gene
expression data, we were not able to associate Cav1 CGI shore
methylation with Cav1 expression in this cohort of patients.
However, using the Kaplan–Meier Plotter tool,41 we found that
Cav1 expression was associated with overall survival rates for
breast cancer patients with ERa-negative tumors (total patient
number ¼ 63, P-value ¼ 0.028) (Figure 8a). This association was
also observed in ERa-negative, grade 3 patients (total patient
number ¼ 47, P-value ¼ 0.037) (Figure 8b).
DISCUSSION
Cav1 expression has been associated with basal-like breast
cancer.22 In the current study, we demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time,
alteration of Cav1 expression when a breast cancer cell line
changes from luminal subtype (MCF7) to basal-like (MCF7-F), using
a previously established breast cancer model.33 We further
demonstrate an oncogenic role for Cav1 in basal-like cell lines,
Oncogene (2013) 4519 – 4528

by enhancing cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth,
migration and invasion (Figure 1). In agreement with a new
understanding of the role of CGI shore methylation in cancer,30
previously considered a mere extension of CGI methylation, we
report, for the ﬁrst time, a strong association between CGI shore
methylation and Cav1 expression in breast cancer and conﬁrm this
unique methylation pattern in a panel of 30 breast cancer cell lines
(Figures 2–5). We further show that Cav1 CGI shores are
hypomethylated in the basal subtype of breast cancer cell lines
(Figure 5), supporting its association with tumor progression. In
human breast tumors, Cav1 30 -CGI shore is more often hypermethylated in ERa-positive tumors than in ERa-negative tumors
(Figures 6 and 7). The correlation of Cav1 expression and clinical
outcome (Figure 8) suggests that Cav1 may represent a novel
prognostic factor for ERa-negative, basal-like breast cancer.
The function of Cav1 in cancer is cell context dependent.10 In
ERa-positive breast cancer cells, Cav1 has a tumor-suppressive
role. Estradiol treatment reduces Cav1 expression to promote
cell proliferation,18,42 and MCF7 cells stably overexpressing
Cav1 exhibit reduced cell growth, colony formation and
invasiveness.43 However, in ERa-negative basal-like breast cancer
cells, Cav1 switches to an oncogenic role. It can elevate insulin
growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor transcription44 to promote cell
proliferation or become phosphorylated at tyrosine 14 to enhance
anchorage-independent growth and promotes tumor cell
migration.45 Here, we illustrated that the switch of the role of
Cav1 is accompanied with Cav1 upregulation, as well as Cav1 CGI
shore demethylation.

Figure 7. Dot plots of Cav1 promoter methylation in human breast tumors. As Cav1 CGI shore methylation extends into part of the CpG island
(CGI), the 50 -CGI shore analyzed here covers 500 bp upstream of CGI and 250 bp in the 50 CGI. The 30 -CGI shore covers 500 bp downstream of

(two ends). Two-sided Mann–Whitney test was used to analyze statistic significance and P-values are as indicated.

Our conclusion that Cav1 expression is not strongly regulated
by promoter CGI methylation is further conﬁrmed by a recently
reported breast cancer methylome study,46 which used the
Inﬁnium platform covering CpG sites only in the Cav1 promoter
CGI. As shown in Supplementary Table S3 ﬁve of the six CpG sites
were hypomethylated and no association of methylation with
Cav1 expression or clinical outcome was observed. Our observation of Cav1 CGI shore methylation is also consistent with several
previous studies. Engelman et al.47 reported Cav1 CGI methylation
in breast cancer cell lines. However, the interrogated region in that
study (  359 to  330 bp) was actually upstream of the currently
deﬁned Cav1 CGI. Methylation of seven CpG sites, located from
 404 to  149 bp upstream of the CGI, within the 50 -CGI shore of
Cav1 we studied, were sufﬁcient to abolish Cav1 expression.35,36,48
Cav1 30 -CGI shore methylation has not been reported previously,
perhaps because this region surrounds the second exon of Cav1,
while previous studies examined whether promoter/ﬁrst exon
methylation correlated with Cav1 transcriptional silencing.
However, because of alternative splicing, Cav1 has four
transcript variants encoding a and b isoforms, transcribed from
the 50 UTR (variant 1, isoform a) or upstream of the second exon
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

(variant 2/3/4, isoform b). We are currently investigating whether
the 30 -CGI shore methylation may also regulate isoform
expression.
To examine whether the Cav1 CGI chromatin environment (and
shore regions) associates with Cav1 expression, we performed
ChIP-seq analysis for histone tail modiﬁcations in MCF7 and MCF7T (both Cav1-low cell lines; Figure 1). In MCF7, high level of
H3K4me2 enrichment was observed at the Cav1 CGI region, with
minimal enrichment of this active mark in the CGI shore
(Supplementary Figure S13). Enrichment of H3K9me2 was only
observed at Cav1 30 -CGI shore, while H3K27me3 occupied both
Cav1 50 - and 30 -CGI shores. Similar enrichment of H3K4me2 at the
Cav1 CGI region in MCF7-T cells was seen; however, H3K9me2 and
H3K27me3 repressive marks accrued at the center of the CGI
region and 30 -CGI shore (Supplementary Figure S13). Combined
with the above results, H3K4me2 enrichment in the Cav1 CGI does
not appear sufﬁcient to activate Cav1 transcription in MCF7 and
MCF7-T cells, thus suggesting a need for other factors. On the
other hand, H3K4me2 occupancy on Cav1 CGI may contribute to
the CGI hypomethylation, as H3K4 methylation inhibits de novo
DNA methylation.49

Figure 8. Relationship of Cav1 expression and overall survival of breast cancer patients. (a) Survival analysis indicating significantly worse
overall survival of patients with ERa-negative tumors expressing higher level of Cav1 (total patient number ¼ 63, P-value ¼ 0.028). (b) Survival
analysis indicating significantly worse overall survival of ERa-negative, grade 3 patients (total patient number ¼ 47, P-value ¼ 0.037).

In breast cancer, Cav1 expression is strongly negatively
correlated with ERa expression,50 and ERa has been reported to
silence Cav1.48 It has been reported that treatment with
estradiol18,42 decreases Cav1 expression. We also observed that
tamoxifen (Figure 1c), which stabilizes ERa protein level,51 reduced
Cav1 expression in MCF7 cells. ERa protein levels are increased
in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines,33,52 and Cav1
expression is further repressed in MCF7-T compared with MCF7
(Figure 1a), along with an increase in CGI shore methylation
(Figure 3a). Taken together, these observations indicate that ERa
may be the primary factor contributing to Cav1 CGI shore
methylation and repressed Cav1 expression in ERa-positive breast
cancer. However, CGI shore methylation appears to permanently
silence Cav1, as short-term treatment of MCF7 cells with
fulvestrant, which induces rapid ERa degradation,51 has no
effect on Cav1 levels48 (Figure 1c). During the development of
stable fulvestrant resistance and the ERa-negative, basal-like
phenotype, Cav1 CGI shore hypomethylation appears to be
induced by an unknown mechanism(s) that may warrant further
investigation.
No association between Cav1 expression and overall survival
was observed when the entire breast cancer cohort was used in
the analysis (Supplementary Figure S14), consistent with a
previous report50 and the fact that over 70% of breast cancer in
the cohort are ERa positive and display low Cav1 expression.
However, our subgroup analysis revealed that elevated Cav1 levels
in more aggressive ERa-negative patients associated with shorter
overall survival (Figure 7a). Further subgrouping of the cohort to
grade 3 breast cancer resulted in a similar negative association
(Figure 7b). These results imply that Cav1 expression may serve as
a prognostic factor for ERa-negative and high-grade breast cancer
patients. However, it should be noted that the number of patients
with ERa-negative breast cancer and Cav1 expression was limited.
In addition, cohort differences may affect the results, as a recent
study identiﬁed Cav1 as an independent prognostic factor for
invasive breast carcinoma.53
In this the ﬁrst report of an oncogenic role for Cav1 in basal-like
breast cancer, and ﬁrst comprehensive analysis of Cav1 methylation, we reveal a negative relationship between Cav1 CGI shore
methylation and Cav1 expression in breast cancer. Our ﬁndings
support a previously described role for CGI shore methylation in
cancer,30 demonstrating the importance of including CGI shores in
future DNA methylome analyses. We speciﬁcally demonstrate an
association between Cav1 CGI shore methylation and breast
tumor progression. The correlation of Cav1 level and clinical
outcome further suggests that Cav1 expression and Cav1 CGI
shore methylation may represent novel prognostic factors for ERanegative, basal-like breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Breast cancer cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured according to the protocols
provided by the company. MCF7, MCF7-T, and MCF7-F cells were cultured
as previously described.33 5-Aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) was
purchsed from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC (St Louis, MO, USA). Small
interfering RNAs that target Cav1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). pCMV6-XL5 (vector) and pCav1 (plasmid that
overexpresses Cav1) were purchased from OriGene Technologies Inc.
(Rockville, MD, USA). Anti-Cav1 (clone 2297) antibody was from BD
Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA).

Transfection, cell viability assay and clonogenicity assays
Plasmids were transfected with Eugene HD Transfection Reagent (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for small interfering RNA transfections.
Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) assay, as described
previously.33 To examine clonogenic activity, cells were seeded (300 er
well) in six-well plates, cultured for 10–14 days, and then stained with 0.5%
methylene blue in 50% methanol. Colonies containing X50 cells were
scored.

Migration/invasion assays
Migration/invasion assays were performed according to previous description.54 Transwell chambers (24-well; BD BioCoat Control Inserts from BD
Biosciences) with 8.0-mm pore size polycarbonate membrane were used for
migration assay, and BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (BD
Biosciences) was used for invasion assays. Migrated and invaded cells
were stained and observed under the optical microscope at a
magniﬁcation of  100. Cells were counted in 5 ﬁelds of triplicate
membranes. See Supplementary Materials for details.

DNA extraction and bisulphite conversion
Genomic DNA was isolated using QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA), as described previously.55 Sodium bisulﬁte conversion
and cleanup were performed using EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo
Research, Orange, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Methylation speciﬁc PCR and bisulﬁte genomic DNA sequencing
DNA methylation on the Cav1 CGI and 50 -CGI shore was determined using
methylation-speciﬁc PCR according to previous description.35,38
Methylated and unmethylated control DNAs were purchased from
Qiagen. Bisulﬁte genomic DNA sequencing was used to determine
methylation of Cav1 CGI, as described previously.35 See Supplementary
Materials for details.

DNA methylation analysis by pyrosequencing
The Pyro Mark Assay Design program (Qiagen) was used to design primers
for ampliﬁcation of speciﬁc regions of Cav1 CGI and CGI shores from
bisulﬁte-converted genomic DNA (Supplementary Table S1). The methylation level of individual CpG sites in each amplicon was detected using
Pyrosequencing system56 and analyzed by the Pyro Q-CpG software.
Box-and-whisker plots, generated in GraphPad Prism version 4.0
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using default settings, were
used to display the methylation results. The boxes show the interquartile
range (IQR) around the median; the whiskers extend from the minimum
value to the maximum value.

Methyl-CpG binding domain-based capture coupled with
massively parallel sequencing and identiﬁcation of differentially
methylated regions
Methyl-CpG binding domain protein sequencing was performed for 30
breast cancer cell lines, 77 breast tumors (Supplementary Table S2) and 10
normal breast tissues as previously described.32,57,58 The genome-wide
methylation data were processed using mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS (Chae et al.
unpublished). MACS59 was used to identify differentially methylated regions
in breast cancer cell lines. The bi-asymmetric-Lapilace model58 was used to
identify differentially methylated regions in breast tumors. See Supplementary Materials for details. The methylome data set is available at ‘‘The Cancer
Methylome System’’ website: http://cbbiweb.uthscsa.edu/KMethylomes/.

Correlation analysis
A Pearson correlation one-tailed t-test was performed to measure
the association between the gene expression and methylation.
A P-valueo0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. Correlation coefﬁcients
(r values) from  1.0 to  0.7 represented a strong negative association,
with r value from  0.7 to  0.3 considered weak negative associations
and r values from  0.3 to þ 0.3 indicating little or no association.

RNA-seq
For whole transcriptome analysis, RNA-seq libraries were generated
utilizing a modiﬁed version of the Illumina directional mRNA-seq library
protocol with duplex speciﬁc nuclease (DSN; Evrogen, Moscow, Russia)
normalization (Nephew and co-workers, manuscript in preparation). Next
generation sequencing was performed with the Illumina GAII analyzer.
Sequence reads (51 bp) were mapped to the human genome (NCBI36/
hg18) using the Solexa Analysis Pipeline with BFAST alignments and a
TopHat-like strategy to determine splicing junctions followed by expression level (RPKM) analyses with Cufﬂinks.60 See Supplementary Materials
for details.

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
The association of Cav1 expression and overall survival rate in breast
cancer patients was analyzed using an online survival analysis tool,
Kaplan–Meier Plotter (http://kmplot.com/backup/breast). It assesses the
effect of gene expression on breast cancer prognosis using microarray data
from 1809 patients.41 The patient data are from GEO, with available raw
data and clinical survival information),

Statistical analysis
For MTT cell viability, clonogenicity, quantitative reverse transcription–PCR,
and migration/invasion assays, statistical signiﬁcance was analyzed by
unpaired Student’s t-test. For the methylation results (box-and-whisker
plots), paired Student’s t-test was performed. P-valueso0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant. For Cav1 promoter methylation in
breast tumors, statistical signiﬁcance was analyzed by two-sided Mann–
Whitney test.
