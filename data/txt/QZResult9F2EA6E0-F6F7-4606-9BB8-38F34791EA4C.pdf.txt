Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of colorectal cancer (CRC) are often
inconsistent among different studies. To determine candidate miRNA biomarkers for
CRC, we performed an integrative analysis of miRNA expression profiling compared
CRC tissues and paired neighboring noncancerous colorectal tissues. Using robust
rank aggregation method, we identified a miRNA set of 10 integrated-signature
miRNAs. In addition, the qRT-PCR validation demonstrated that 9 miRNAs were
consistent dysregulated with the integrative analysis in CRC tissues, 4 miRNAs (miR21-5p, miR-183-5p, miR-17-5p and miR-20a-5p) were up-regulated expression, and
5 miRNAs (miR-145-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-139-5p, miR-378a-5p and miR-143-3p)
were down-regulated expression (all p < 0.05). Consistent with the initial analysis, 7
miRNAs were found to be significantly dysregulated in CRC tissues in TCGA data base,
4 miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-183-5p, miR-17-5p and miR-20a-5p) were significantly
up-regulated expression, and 3 miRNAs (miR-145-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-378a5p) were significantly down-regulated expression in CRC tissues (all p < 0.001).
Furthermore, miR-17-5p (p = 0.011) and miR-20a-5p (p = 0.003) were up-regulated
expression in the III/IV tumor stage, miR-145-5p (p = 0.028) and miR-195-5p (p =
0.001) were significantly increased expression with microscopic vascular invasion in
CRC tissues, miR-17-5p (p = 0.037) and miR-145-5p (p = 0.023) were significantly
increased expression with lymphovascular invasion. Moreover, Cox regression analysis
of CRC patients in TCGA data base showed miR-20a-5p was correlated with survival
(hazard ratio: 1.875, 95%CI: 1.088–3.232, p = 0.024). Hence, the finding of current
study provides a basic implication of these miRNAs for further clinical application in
CRC.

Introduction

[2]. The survival of the patients relies on early detection
significantly, and the prognosis mainly depends on tumornode-metastasis (TNM) classification [3, 4]. Most of
the patients are in poor prognosis while they are often
diagnosed at an advanced stage[3]. Although there are
various methods to screen biomarkers in CRC, they are

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most
commonly cancer worldwide. The incidence of CRC is
4.4% in developed areas and 1.4% in developing areas [1],
and the five year survival rate ranges from 40% to 60%

often lack of sensitivity or specificity [5-7].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to a class of small
noncoding RNAs that can regulate the expression level
of target genes at the post-transcription phase. Growing
evidences indicate that miRNAs can serve as ideal
biomarkers for cancer detection and accurate predictions
of prognosis, as well as targets for treatment [8, 9]. The
number of miRNAs has increased largely from 2002 to
2014, and the latest miRBase version (Release 21, 2014)
contains 2588 mature human miRNA entries. There are
some studies to search biomarkers by analyzing miRNA
expression profiling between CRC tissues and paired
neighboring noncancerous colorectal tissues, but the
results of identification significantly expressed miRNAs
are inconsistent or discrepant among each study. There
are several reasons to be responsible for the inconsistent
results, such as different technological detection platforms,
various methods for data processing, constant discovery
of new miRNAs and samples from different backgrounds.
To overcome these limitations, we need to
integrate their results in an unbiased manner. Robust
rank aggregation (RRA) approach has been specifically
designed for comparison of several ranked gene lists
[10]. The tool looks at how each item is positioned in
the ranked lists and compares this to the baseline case
where all the preference lists are randomly shuffled. As a
result, a p-value would be assigned for all items, showing
how much better it was positioned in the ranked lists
than expected by chance. This p-value is used both for
reranking the items and deciding their significance. RRA
is a suitable and effective solution for identification of
statistically significant miRNA integrated-signature and is
particularly useful when input experiments are performed
by different technological platforms cover different sets
of genes and full rankings of miRNAs are not available.

Hence, we executed integrated analysis approach by
using RRA method to identify the consistently significant
miRNAs in different expression profiling datasets.
Moreover, we further validated the consistent up-regulated
and down-regulated miRNAs in fresh CRC tissues and
TCGA datasets in a clinical setting.

Results
Characteristics of the studies and datasets
According to selection criteria, 27 CRC miRNA
expression profiling datasets from 24 studies were
retrieved from publication. A brief description of the
studies is provided in Supplementary Table 1. All studies
were reported by the peer-reviewed publications. The
studies were published between 2006 and 2014, and 9
studies (more than one third) were published in 2012.
Among the 24 studies, 11 studies (PZ [11], RE [12], PP
[13], HF [14], GD [15], FK [16], CL [17], CH [18], WA
[19], MZ [20], BD [21]) conducted in Europe population,
8 studies (XU [22], LA [23], ZH [24], LX [25], FU [26],
CW [27], MY [28], CX [29]) conducted in Asia population
and 5 studies (LE [30], SL [31], AR [32], ST [33], CM
[34]) conducted in North America population. Distribution
of CRC-specific miRNA alterations as reported by primary
studies was shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
The number of research samples ranged from 3 to
84 (median 27) across the studies. The average number of
miRNAs assayed was 772 (ranging from 156 to 2090) and
most of the studies applied various microarray platforms
(either commercial or custom). Five studies were focused
only on colon cancer and two studies included only

integrated-signature miRNAs is consistent across all
studies. The majority of the integrated-signature miRNAs
belong to the broadly conserved seed families (conserved
across most vertebrates).
The 10 integrated-signature miRNA genes are
scattered on different chromosome regions and 6
integrated-signature miRNAs belong to the cluster of
two or more miRNAs. A cluster is defined as follows:
miRNA genes locate at a distance of less than 10 kb and
not separated by a transcription unit. MiR-17-5p and miR20a-5p are all in the chromosomal location of 13q31.3 and
belong to the same cluster. MiR-145-5p, miR-378a-5p and
miR-143-3p are all in the chromosomal location of 5q32,
but miR-378a-5p doesn’t belong to the cluster of miR143/145.
Analysis of studies which consisted of colon or
rectum samples only, showed that in colon cancer, there
are three up-regulated (miR-21-5p, miR-20a-5p and miR17-5p) and two down-regulated (miR-145-5p and miR195-5p) integrated-signature miRNAs reached statistical
significance (Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.0003, 0.0013,
0.0031, 0.0002 and 0.0254, respectively). In the case of
rectal cancer, exception of miR-183-5p and miR-139-5p,
the other integrated-signature miRNAs were all reached
statistical significance.

rectal cancer. One study (CL) listed the results from
different microarray platforms separately and these data
were treated as four different input datasets. The pooled
datasets included a total of 588 CRC samples and 505
noncancerous tissues samples.
In total, there are 228 significantly up-regulated
miRNAs and 230 significantly down-regulated miRNAs
reported at least in one study. Additionally, 77 miRNAs
were reported as inconsistent alteration. Each study
reported with up-regulated miRNAs and down-regulated
miRNAs except one study (MY), which reported with
only up-regulated miRNAs and no down-regulated ones.
The number of significantly dysregulated miRNAs varies
across the studies and the top list of miRNAs differs
greatly from study to study (Figure 1). Additionally,
none of the miRNAs altered consistently across all of the
studies.

Identification integrated-signature miRNAs
A list of statistically significant integrated-signature
miRNAs included 5 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated
miRNAs were identified in CRC samples compared
to noncancerous colorectal tissues using RRA method
(Table 1). All of the 10 integrated-signature miRNAs
that reached statistical significance after Bonferroni
correction were reported by at least 1/2 datasets. The
full list of statistically significant miRNAs is provided
in Supplementary Table 2. The most significantly upregulated (miR-21-5p) and down-regulated (miR145-5p) miRNAs were reported by 19 and 21 datasets,
respectively. The direction of expression alteration of

for CRC, the expression levels of these miRNAs were
compared using qRT-PCR analysis between 11 CRC
tissues and the neighboring noncancerous colorectal
tissues. The results showed that expression alteration of
the miRNAs is consistent with the integrated analysis
except miR-31-5p. The expression level of miR-21-5p,
miR-183-5p, miR-17-5p and miR-20a-5p were increased
more than 2 folds (all p < 0.05), whereas miR-145-5p,
miR-195-5p, miR-139-5p, miR-378a-5p and miR-143-3p
were decreased more than 2 folds in CRC tissues (all p <
0.05) (Figure 2). The most up-regulated expressed miRNA
was miR-17-5p with a 4.95 fold change (p = 0.003) and
the most down-regulated expressed miRNA was miR378a-5p with a 0.09 fold change in CRC tissues compared
to noncancerous tissues (p < 0.001).
Consistent with our initial analysis, 7 miRNAs were

found to be significantly dysregulated in CRC tissues in
Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data base, except
miR-143-3p, miR-195-5p and miR-31-5p (Figure 3A,
Figure 3B). However, the expression changed more than
2-fold was found in miR-21-5p, miR-183-5p, miR-17-5p,
miR-20a-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-378a-5p
(all p < 0.001). The TCGA results showed miR-17-5p (p
= 0.011) and miR-20a-5p (p = 0.003) were significantly
increased in the III/IV tumor stage comparing to I/II
tumor stage (Supplementary Figure 2A, 2B). Patients with
lymphovascular invasion had a significantly increased
expression of miR-17-5p (p = 0.037) and miR-145-5p (p
= 0.023), while a decreased expression of miR-143-3p
(p = 0.006) comparing to ones without lymphovascular
invasion (Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B). In addition,
miR-145-5p (p = 0.028) and miR-195-5p (p = 0.001) were

Furthermore, we used Cox regression analysis of
CRC patients in TCGA data base to build a prognostic
classifier, by which only miR-20a-5p was selected: miR20a-5p (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.875, 95%CI: 1.088-3.232, p
= 0.024). X-tile and K-M survival analysis also showed
the miR-20a-5p could predict the clinical outcome of CRC

enrichment analyses were performed to elucidate the
biological function of consensus target genes. Finally,
139 KEGG pathways, 78 Panther pathways and 978 GO
processes were enriched with the miRNAs targets.
Enriched KEGG pathways and Panther pathways
were most frequently associated with cell signaling
(MAPK signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway,
EGF receptor signaling pathway, Apoptosis signaling
pathway) and tumorigenesis (Pathways in cancer,
Angiogenesis, Ras Pathway, p53 pathway), but also
with cell mobility and community (regulation of actin
cytoskeleton, Focal adhesion) (Table 2). The most
enriched GO processes regulated by the miRNAs include
regulation of transcription, cell cycle, signal transduction,
and apoptotic process. The heatmaps of enriched KEGG
pathways and Panther pathways are shown in Figure 5 and
Supplementary Figure 6, respectively.
Furthermore, to evaluate association between these
pathways and CRC, the publications which described CRC
related constituent objects in the pathways were searched
in PubMed. The pathways in which the constituent
objects supported were considered to be CRC-related.
After text mining, 42 KEGG pathways and 28 Panther

Discussion
The most common drawback of miRNA expression
profiling studies is inconsistency among different studies.
A reasonable solution to the problem is to determine
the miRNAs which were consistently reported among
the different miRNA expression profiling studies and
expressed in a consistent orientation. Systematic review
or meta-analysis has been done previously to determine
differentially expressed genes in cancer at the gene level
[35, 36]. However, such rigorous approach is often not
possible due to the lack of cross-platform standardization
of miRNA profiling technologies or the unavailability
of raw data. In this study, we analyzed CRC-specific
miRNAs derived from independent expression profiling
experiments using RRA method. The miRNAs would be

re-ranked and their significance would be re-decided. We
identified an integrated-signature of 5 up-regulated and
5 down-regulated miRNAs from 27 expression profiling
datasets included more than 1000 CRC tissue and
noncancerous tissue samples.
To determine whether the 10 integrated-signature
miRNAs have clinical values as biomarkers in CRC,
we also performed a validation experiment. Our data
confirmed the expression changes of 9 miRNAs were
consistent with our integrated analysis. These results of our
validation experiment have further supported the findings
obtained in the present integrated analysis. Consistent with
our initial analysis, 7 miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-183-5p,
miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-139-5p and
miR-378a-5p) were found to be significantly dysregulated
in TCGA data base. In this study, as was validated by qRTPCR and TCGA datasets, the expression changes of the
7 miRNAs were all consistent with integrated analysis.
Therefore, this miRNA panel might be novel potential
biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC.
The integrated-signature miRNAs are key regulatory
factors of the oncogenic process. This is supported by
KEGG and Panther pathways enrichment analyses of
targets of miRNAs, which indicate very strong impact on
pathways such as: Pathways in cancer, MAPK signaling
pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, EGF receptor signaling
pathway, Apoptosis signaling pathway (Table 2). In
addition, the association between these pathways and
CRC are highly related by publication analysis. Therefore,
these miRNAs may be good candidate therapeutic targets
in CRC. Further studies could be performed to evaluate
the clinical values of the miRNA expression signature in
CRC.
The most consistently reported miRNA of upregulation in our integrated analysis is miR-21-5p, which
is an oncogenic factor and often alters expression in
cancers. It is shown that miR-21-5p directly target the
tumor-suppressor PTEN, chemokine gene CCL20 and
PDCD4 [37-39]. High level of miR-21-5p is associated
with worse survival and poor response to chemotherapy
in CRC patients [40]. Furthermore, miRNA-21-5p can

induce resistance to 5-f﻿﻿luorouracil by down-regulating
human DNA MutS homolog 2 (hMSH2), which was
a core mismatch repair recognition protein complex
[41]. Additionally, miR-21-5p expression level showed
significant association with depth of invasion, lymphatic
and venous invasion, liver metastasis and Dukes’ stage
[42]. The most consistently reported down-regulated
miRNA is miR-145-5p which was shown to possess antitumorigenic activity, including involvement in various
cancer-related processes such as proliferation, invasion and
migration. It is showed that miR-145-5p directly targeted
catenin δ-1, contributing to the aberrant translocation
of β-catenin in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
to suppress human colon cancer cells [43]. Moreover,
several genes have been shown to be direct target by miR145-5p in CRC [44-48], and majority of these genes are
oncosuppression. Additionally, patients with a low miR145-5p expression level had significantly more often
a worse response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
compared to patients with a high expression level of miR145-5p [49].
It is showed that miR-183-5p, miR-17-5p and
miR-20a-5p are all oncogenic miRNAs that regulates
tumorigenesis and progression. MiR-17-5p and miR-20a5p are located in a cluster in the 13q31.3 chromosomal
region, which combine with 8q24 could convert colorectal
adenoma to adenocarcinoma [50]. Previous publications
have demonstrated that up-regulated miR-17-5p and
miR-20a-5p could promoted cell proliferation, tumour
growth and cell cycle progression by targeting the RND3
and BIM tumour suppressor gene, respectively [51, 52].
Additionally, miR-183-5p functions as an oncogene by
targeting the transcription factor EGR1 and promoting
colon cancer cells migration [53]. MiR-139-5p and miR378a-5p are all anti-tumor miRNAs that exert tumor
suppressor function in CRC. MiR-139-5p promotes cell

and validation between tumor and noncancerous tissue
only, the significantly and consistently reported miRNAs
could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers. In a
clinical setting, sufficient sensitivity and specificity of the
panel of miRNAs should be determined in the further well
designed clinical studies. Furthermore, targets prediction
and functional enrichment analysis may provide a clue for
elucidating the role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis of CRC
and the precise underlying mechanisms. Taken together,
the findings of the current study may have substantial
clinical significance or implications.
In conclusion, a CRC associated miRNA expression
signature, consisting of 7 highly significant and
consistently dysregulated miRNAs, were identified in
our integrated analysis and validation study, which may
be potential candidate biomarkers for CRC. The rigorous
evaluation of integrated-miRNA signature and functional
enrichment analysis of their targets were promising
them as candidates for diagnostic biomarkers of CRC.
Further clinical and mechanistic studies focusing on these
miRNAs are required for their clinical significance and the
underlying mechanisms in tumorigenesis of CRC.

probes were excluded from integrated analysis.
To identify miRNAs that are ranked consistently
better than expected by chance, we used RRA method
implemented as a RobustRankAggreg package in R
software (version 3.1.3). Analysis was repeated 10,000
times to assess the stability of acquired p-values by one
random miRNA list removed from the analysis each time.
Acquired p-values from each round were finally averaged
for each miRNA.

Validation of the integrated-signature miRNAs
To validate the expression of integrated-signature
miRNAs, fresh CRC tissues and paired neighboring
noncancerous colorectal tissues were obtained from
11 patients by experienced surgeons and examined by
experienced pathologists at the First Affiliated Hospital
of Wenzhou Medical University (the detailed information
of patients is provided in Table 3). Informed consents
were obtained from all the patients and the study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board. The samples
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen in 10 minutes
after surgical resection and were then stored at −80°C
temperature until RNA extraction.
Total RNA was extracted and isolated using
miRNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. SYBR-Green qRT-PCR
assay was used for miRNA quantification. In brief, 40 ng
of total RNA containing miRNA was polyadenylated by
poly (A) polymerase and then reverse transcribed to cDNA
using miScript Reverse Transcription kit (QIAGEN)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time
qPCR was performed using miScript SYBR-Green PCR
kit (QIAGEN) containing universal primer in ABI 7500
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The primers of each
dysregulated miRNAs were listed in Supplementary Table
4. Each reaction volume contains 4 μl of cDNA, 0.5 mM
of each primer and SYBR-Green PCR Master mix in a
final 20 μl volume. The amplification program was: 95˚C
for 2 min for one cycle, then 94˚C for 20 sec with 60˚C
for 35 sec for 45 cycles, and melting curve analyses were
performed at the end of the cycles. The expression levels
of miRNAs were normalized to RNU6B. The relative
expression of each miRNA was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt
method. Student’s t-test was used to compare miRNA
expression values of CRC and noncancerous colorectal
tissues, and p < 0.05 indicated significant difference.
The results of qRT-PCR were validated in the TCGA
datasets. The miRNA expression data and corresponding
clinical information for CRC datasets were downloaded
from TCGA data portal in June 2015(Supplementary
Table 5). TCGA data are classified by data type (clinical,
mutations, gene expression) and data level, to allow
structured access to this resource with appropriate
patient privacy protection. This study meets the
publication guidelines provided by TCGA. The miRNA

Materials and Methods
Studies selection and analysis
CRC miRNA expression profiling studies were
identified through Web of Science (www.isiknowledge.
com) and PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) using
search term: ((mirna OR microrna or mirnas or micrornas)
AND (profile or profiles or profiling or pattern) AND
(colorectal OR colon OR rectal) AND (cancer OR tumor
OR adenocarcinoma OR neoplasia)). The last search was
performed in December 15 2014. To ensure that relevant
studies were not missed, search was also performed in
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gds) and ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress).
Full texts of studies published in English language
were involved in our analysis, and only original
experimental studies that screened different miRNAs
between CRC and paired adjacent noncancerous tissue
in human were included for further evaluation. Studies
analyzing the individual preselected candidate miRNAs
or using only cell lines as the research samples were
excluded. Studies that profiled different expression
miRNAs only in histological subtypes but did not include
noncancerous tissue were also excluded.
The lists of miRNAs that had statistically significant
changes in expression level were accurate extracted from
each eligible study. In case the miRNA lists was not
available from the publications, the authors were contacted
directly. All miRNA names were standardized according to
miRBase version 21, and viral miRNAs and non-miRNA

expression profiling was performed using the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 miRNA sequencing platforms (Illumina
Inc, San Diego, CA). The miRNA expression level was
demonstrated as reads per million miRNA mapped data.
The miRNA expression analyses were performed using
BRB-ArrayTools (version 4.4). In brief, the miRNAs
with missing data exceeded 10% of all subjects were
excluded from the datasets and the expression level of
each individual miRNA was log2-transformed for further
analysis.
The prognosis of CRC strongly depends upon
tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion and microscopic
vascular invasion (MVI). Therefore, the differences
of miRNAs expression level were also tested with or
without lymphovascular invasion, presence of MVI or
not, and different tumor stages in the TCGA datasets.
The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
18.0 (SPSS Inc.). Statistical significance was defined
as p < 0.05. For survival analysis, we used the KaplanMeier method to analysis the correlation between overall
survival and the miRNAs, and the log-rank test was used
to compare survival curves. The optimum cut-off value for
the miRNAs using X-tile plots based on the association
with mortality of the patients. X-tile plots provide a
single and intuitive method to assess the association
between variables and survival. The X-tile program can
automatically select the optimum data cut point according
to the highest χ2 value (minimum p-value) defined by
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test [56].
We did the X-tile plots using the X-tile software version
3.6.1 (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,
CT, USA).

Enrichment analyses for KEGG, Panther pathways
and GO processes were performed with GeneCodis web
tool (http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es/). Consensus target
genes for each integrated-signature miRNA were used as
input data and then acquired false discovery rate (FDR)corrected p-values of each pathway. Clustering of the
heatmap was acquired by applying a pheatmap package
in R software (version 3.1.3) based on Pearson correlation
and average linkage. Furthermore, the association between
the pathways affected by altered expression of miRNAs
and CRC was evaluated.

Target prediction

References

The potential targets of integrated-signature
miRNAs were predicted by five different target prediction
algorithms: TargetScan v6.2 (http://www.targetscan.
org/vert_61/), DIANA-microT-CDS v5.0 (http://diana.
imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools/index. php?r =
microT_CDS/index), miRanda (http://www.microrna.
org/microrna/getMirna- Form.do), miRDB (http://mirdb.
org/miRDB/) and PicTar (http://pictar.mdc-berlin. de/
cgi-bin/PicTar_vertebrate.cgi). Only genes with target
sites in 3’ UTR were selected. Validated target genes were
obtained from starBase v2.0 database (http://starbase.sysu.
edu.cn/mirMrna.php) based on CLIP-Seq and TarBase
v7.0 database (http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/
DianaTools/index.php?r = tarbase/ index). Consensus
targets were defined as genes predicted by at least three
algorithms plus validated targets.
