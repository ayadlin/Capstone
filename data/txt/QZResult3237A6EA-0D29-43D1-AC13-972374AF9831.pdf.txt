BACKGROUND: Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a member of polycomb group proteins, is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and has been implicated in various human malignancies, including breast cancer, and
also has been associated with aggressive tumor behavior. However, the clinical significance of EZH2 expression in
inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a rare but aggressive type of breast carcinoma, has not been explored. In this retrospective study, the authors examined EZH2 expression in IBC tumors and evaluated the relation between EZH2
expression and patient survival. METHODS: Tissue microarrays of 88 surgically resected IBC tumors were stained
immunohistochemically for EZH2, and the authors evaluated the association of EZH2 expression status with clinicopathologic factors and clinical outcome. RESULTS: The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 45.7 months, and
the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 45%. EZH2 was expressed frequently in IBC tumors (75.7%) and was associated significantly with unfavorable prognostic factors, such as higher tumor grade, negative estrogen receptor status,
and triple-negative status (ie, negative for the estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptors). Univariate survival analysis indicated that patients who had EZH2-positive IBC had a significantly lower 5-year
OS rate than patients who had EZH2-negative IBC (P ¼ .01). In multivariate analysis, only positive EZH2 status
remained an independent predictor of worse OS. CONCLUSIONS: EZH2 was expressed frequently in IBC tumors. The
current results indicated that EZH2 expression status may be used to identify a subset of patients with IBC who have
a relatively worse prognosis. Targeting EZH2 also may provide a novel strategy for improving the clinical outcome of

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare, accounting for approximately 2.5% of all breast cancers in the United

States,1 and it is the most aggressive type of breast cancer. Characterized by diffuse dermal lymphatic plugging by tumor
emboli, patients with IBC typically present with rapid onset and progression of breast enlargement with overlying skin
changes, such as diffuse erythema, edema or peau d’orange, induration, tenderness, and warmth, mimicking the inflammatory process. At the time of diagnosis, approximately two-thirds of patients with IBC have locoregional lymph node
metastasis, and up to one-third have distant metastasis.1 Despite improvement in the overall survival (OS) rate for IBC
patients with current multimodality treatment,1,2 the clinical outcome of these patients remains poor. In 1 study, the 5year OS rate for patients with IBC was 40.5% compared with 63.2% for patients with locally advance non-IBC, although
the patients had received similar multimodal treatment.3 Understanding biologic insights that underlie the aggressive

behavior of IBC and identifying novel therapeutic strategies are highly desirable for improving the clinical outcome of patients with IBC.
The polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic
chromatin modifiers that regulate transcription through
nucleosome modification, chromatin remodeling, and
interaction with other transcription factors, and these proteins are involved in the maintenance of embryonic and
adult stem cells, cell cycle regulation, and cell division.4-11
Deregulation of PcG proteins can lead to cancer, and targeting PcG proteins has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy.12 Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)
is a key member of the PcG proteins. Aberrant expression
of EZH2 has been linked significantly to cell cycle progression and increased tumor cell proliferation (as estimated by Ki-67 expression and mitotic counts) in various
types of cancer.13-17 EZH2 reportedly is implicated in
cancer initiation and in the progression of a variety of
human malignancies, including lymphoma,18,19 gastric
cancer,20 hepatocellular carcinoma,21 prostate cancer,17,22-24 melanoma,17,25 bladder cancer,26 endometrial
cancer,17 and breast cancer.13,14,16,17,27-30 In studies with
breast carcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), Kleer et
al reported that high EZH2 levels were associated significantly with increased tumor size, high disease stage,
younger age at diagnosis, and negative hormone receptor
status. Moreover, those authors observed that EZH2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were significantly
higher in invasive carcinomas that metastasized within 5
years of primary diagnosis compared with invasive carcinomas that did not metastasize.14 Collett et al demonstrated a significant correlation between EZH2 positivity
(assessed by immunochemistry) and locally advanced
breast cancer or metastatic spread at diagnosis.13 Raaphorst et al compared EZH2 expression in benign breast
tissue, invasive breast carcinomas, and their precursors
and observed a positive association between EZH2 expression and histologic grade of breast carcinoma, indicating
that deregulation of EZH2 is related to loss of differentiation.16 Therefore, EZH2 has been proposed as a marker
of aggressive breast cancer associated with poor clinical
outcome. However, to our knowledge, the expression of
EZH2 and its clinical importance in IBC has not been
evaluated previously. In this retrospective study, we examined EZH2 expression in IBC tumors and evaluated the
relation between EZH2 expression and patient survival.
We demonstrated a high frequency (75.7%) of EZH2
expression in IBC tumors and observed that positive
EZH2 status was associated with worse clinical outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study included patients with primary IBC who
were treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center from September 1994 to August 2004
and who had tumor tissue available for analysis and
clinical follow-up information. In all patients, the initial
histologic diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma had
been established on pretreated tumor tissues that were
obtained by core-needle biopsy. Estrogen receptor (ER)
status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status had
been established on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
invasive tumor tissues. All patients then received multimodal treatment, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
surgery, and radiation therapy.
The neoadjuvant chemotherapy included 4 to 6
cycles of an anthracycline-based, intravenous chemotherapy regimen of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2), and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2)
given every 21 days. Most patients (89%) also received
paclitaxel (225 mg/m2) for 3 weeks. At the completion
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all patients underwent
mastectomy; most patients also underwent axillary
lymph node dissection. All patients received postmastectomy radiation to the chest wall and draining lymphatics, 31 patients (35.2%) received adjuvant endocrine
therapy, and all patients with HER2-positive tumors
received adjuvant trastuzumab. We included 88 patients
who had a residual tumor at surgery and whose residual
tumors had enough volume for constructing a tissue
microarray (TMA). Patients who achieved a pathologic
complete response were not eligible. Pathologic characteristics of the 88 tumors and prognostic and predictive
biomarker status were reviewed and recorded retrospectively. This study was approved by The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review
Board.

Tumor Samples and TMAs
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary IBC tumors
obtained from mastectomy were selected for constructing
TMAs. Samples with minimal residual tumor burden or
dispersed tumor cells were excluded to ensure a good quality of the TMAs. We used a manual tissue puncher/array
(Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, Wis) to construct
TMAs. Three cores, each 1.0 mm in greatest dimension,
were obtained from each tumor.

Immunohistochemistry Staining and
Evaluation
Immunohistochemical staining for EZH2 was performed
on TMA slides. Briefly, 4-lm-thick paraffin sections were
dewaxed and treated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30
minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen
retrieval was conducted by steaming the slides in 10 mM
citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 45 minutes. The sections were
incubated for 30 minutes with normal nonimmune serum
to eliminate nonspecific staining and then incubated with
monoclonal antibody against EZH2 (clone 6A10; dilution, 1:200; Leica Novocastra, Bannockburn, Ill) for 1
hour at room temperature. The antigen was detected with
biotin-labeled secondary antibody by the avidin-biotinperoxidase technique using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine as the
chromogen. The tissues were then counterstained with
Mayer hematoxylin solution and were visualized under a
lightfield microscope.
EZH2 staining was interpreted and recorded independently by 2 pathologists (Y.G. and L.H.) in a blinded
manner. Positive EZH2 status was defined as nuclear
staining in at least 10% of invasive cancer cells. Any discrepancies between the findings of the 2 pathologists were
resolved by discussion at a multihead microscope.
ER and PR status had been determined by immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies
against ER (6F11; Novocastra Laboratories, Burlingame,
Calif) and against PR (1A6; Novocastra Laboratories) as
part of the initial routine pathology evaluation. Positive
hormone receptor status was defined as nuclear staining in
at least 10% of invasive cancer cells. HER2 status had
been tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization using the
PathVysion kit (Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill) or by immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody
(AB8; NeoMarkers, Fremont, Calif).
Statistical Analysis
The chi-square test or the Fisher exact test was used to
evaluate associations between EZH2 status and clinicopathologic variables. We used the Kaplan-Meier method
to estimate OS and disease-specific survival (DSS). OS
was calculated from the date of initial pathologic diagnosis
of the primary tumor to the date of death from any cause
or the date of last follow-up. For the DSS analysis, only
disease-related death was considered an event. The
patients who survived or who died from other causes were
censored at the date of last follow-up or death, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was
then used to test the statistical significance of several

5478

potential prognostic factors for OS and DSS. The factors
analyzed included EZH2 expression; age; race; lymph
node status; histologic type; tumor grade; lymphovascular
invasion; ER, PR, and HER-2 status; and triple-negative
(ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2 negative) status.
This modeling was done in a univariate fashion. From
this model, we estimated the hazard ratio for each potential prognostic factor with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
Then, all potential prognostic factors with a P value < .10
from the univariate analysis were included in a saturated
model, and backward elimination was used to remove factors from the model based on the likelihood ratio test in
the multiple regression analysis. The analysis was performed using SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC). All reported P values were 2-sided, and P < .05 was
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Of the 88 patients who were included in this study, 74
(84.1%) were whites, 10 (11.4%) were Hispanics, and 4
(4.5%) were blacks and Asians. Age at the time of initial
diagnosis ranged from 23 years to 75 years (median age,
49.5 years). Sixty-seven patients had stage IIIB disease, 13
had stage IIIC disease, and 8 had stage IVdisease. The median follow-up was 45.7 months (range, 0.2-164.1
months). Lymph node involvement was observed in 67 of
80 patients (83.8%). Histologically, 78 of 88 tumors
(88.6%) were ductal type, 60 of 86 (68.9%) were high
grade tumors, and 65 of 74 (87.8%) demonstrated lymphovascular invasion.
Positive ER expression was observed in 37 of 86 of
tumors (43%), positive PR status was observed in 30 of
86 tumors (34.9%), and HER2 overexpression and/or
amplification was observed in 33 of 85 tumors (38.8%).
Triple-negative status was observed in 21 of 88 tumors
(23.9%). Results of EZH2 staining were available for 74
tumors, of which 56 (75.7%) were EZH2-positive with
mostly moderate-to-strong staining intensity; in the
remaining tumors, the tissue cores either were missing
during staining or contained too few tumor cells to be
interpreted properly. Figure 1 provides images of positive
and negative staining results in representative tumors.
EZH2 Expression and Clinicopathologic
Variables
To determine whether EZH2 expression was associated
significantly with other clinicopathologic variables that
have known potential prognostic value, EZH2 was

EZH2 expression was associated significantly with higher

and triple-negative status (P ¼ .004), and all triple-negative tumors were EZH2-positive.

EZH2 Expression and Patient Outcome
Of the 85 patients who had follow-up information available, 52 patients had died (46 died of IBC, 1 died of
another cause, and 5 died of unknown causes), and 33

5479

Original Article

patients remained alive. The median OS duration was
4.04 years (95% CI, 2.85-8.79 years). The 5-year and 10year OS rates for the entire cohort of patients were 45%
and 37%, respectively. The median DSS duration was
4.56 years (95% CI, 3.17-10.17 years). The 5-year and
10-year DSS rates for the entire cohort of patients were
49% and 40%, respectively.
In univariate analysis, positive EZH2 expression was
associated significantly with a lower OS rate (P ¼ .01)
and a lower DSS rate (P ¼ .03) (Fig. 2). The 5-year OS
rate for patients who had EZH2-positive tumors was 32%
compared with 64% for patients who had EZH2-negative
tumors, and the corresponding 5-year DSS rates were
36% and 65%, respectively (Table 2).
Univariate analyses were performed to determine
whether any other clinicopathologic factors were associated with the clinical outcome of patients with IBC. We
observed that lower OS and DSS rates were associated significantly with negative ER status (P ¼ .007 and P ¼ .02,
respectively) and with triple-negative status (P ¼ .01 and
P ¼ .02, respectively) (Table 2). There was no significant
association between OS and DSS rates and histologic
type, tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node
status, PR status, or HER2 status. In multivariate analysis,
we observed that only EZH2 status remained an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio, 2.74; 95% CI,
1.22-6.15; P ¼ .01), and DSS (hazard ratio, 2.44; 95%
CI, 1.08-5.54; P ¼ .03)

DISCUSSION
Despite advances in the management of IBC over the past
3 decades, the survival of patients with IBC remains much
lower than that of patients with non-IBC. The identification of novel molecular markers that constitute the basis
for target therapy is highly desirable.
Previous experiments demonstrated that the EZH2
expression level increases as breast cancer develops and
progresses14,16,27,31 and that EZH2 is a marker of the
aggressiveness of breast carcinoma-NOS. In the current
study of IBC, an ‘‘intrinsically’’ aggressive form of breast
cancer associated with advanced stage and frequent metastasis, we observed that positive EZH2 status remained
predictive of a relatively worse clinical outcome in patients
with IBC. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
explore the clinical significance of EZH2 expression in
IBC. It is noteworthy that the tumors included in this
study represented refractory or residual IBC tumors after
neoadjuvant systemic therapy.

association between EZH2 expression and positive lymph
node status at surgery. To our knowledge, the association
between EZH2 expression and triple-negative status has

surgical treatment, a lower OS rate, and a higher probability of disease-specific death and that EZH2 status was an
independent predictor of survival.14 Collett et al observed
a significant association between EZH2 expression and
reduced survival in univariate (but not multivariate) analysis.13 Raaphorst et al failed to identify a prognostic value
of EZH2 in a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of 172
patients.16 In a cohort of 688 patients with lymph nodenegative breast cancer who did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy, Reijm et al reported that EZH2 was not
associated significantly with metastasis-free survival; however, those authors observed that higher EZH2 expression
was associated significantly with shorter progression-free
survival in 278 patients who received first-line tamoxifen
monotherapy for recurrent disease.15
In the current study with IBC, we observed that positive EZH2 status was associated significantly with a worse
OS and DSS in both univariate and multivariate analyses,
indicating that EZH2 positivity can be used to identify a
subset of patients with IBC who have relatively worse clinical outcomes. Other factors that were predictive of a poor
clinical outcome in univariate analysis were negative ER
status and triple-negative status. It is interesting that tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node status did not predict worse survival. This probably is
attributable to the fact that IBC, unlike non-IBC, is characterized ‘‘intrinsically’’ by a high frequency of high tumor
grade, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node
involvement.
In agreement with findings by others,13,14 we
observed that EZH2 status was correlated inversely with
ER status. The ER-positive rate in the current study
(43%) was lower than the rate in breast carcinoma-NOS.
This low ER-positive rate may have resulted from the
high frequency of EZH2 expression in IBC tumors. Functional interactions between EZH2 and ER were investigated in previous studies. Reijm et al reported that EZH2
mRNA expression levels were associated inversely with
ER protein levels in 1318 breast cancer specimens; those
authors also observed that the down-regulation of EZH2
mRNA expression in the ER-positive human breast cancer
cell line MCF7 using small interfering RNA was associated significantly with the up-regulation of ER.15 On the
other hand, EZH2 and ER may function independently.
For example, a combination of EZH2 silencing and antiestrogen ICI 164384 treatment caused 67% inhibition of
MCF7 cell growth compared with controls; this reflected
an adding-up effect of EZH2 silencing alone (38% inhibi-

5482

tion) and ICI 164384 treatment alone (25% inhibition),
thus indicating that the effect of EZH2 silencing on
MCF7 growth is independent of the effect of ER inhibition by ICI 164384.15 Clinically, an association of EZH2
with outcome was observed both in patients with ER-positive cancer and in patients with ER-negative breast cancer.14 Recently, a study demonstrated a critical role of
EZH2 in the proliferation and growth of ER-negative
breast cancer both in an animal model and in vitro: EZH2
knockdown decreased the volume of tumors and
improved survival in mice and delayed the transition from
G2 phase to mitosis.28
The mechanisms underlying EZH2 biology in
breast cancer remain to be elucidated. EZH2 exerts its
biologic role mainly as a transcriptional repressor by forming a polycomb-repressive complex with other PcG proteins and regulating a variety of genes involved in cell fate,
differentiation, and proliferation.31-33 EZH2 has histone
lysine methyltransferase activity and trimehylates lysine
residue 27 in histone 3 (H3K27), a mechanism of epigenetic silencing. In addition, EZH2 can transactivate genes
that are commonly targeted by estrogen and Wnt signaling pathways; EZH2 interacts with components of the
estrogen and Wnt pathways (ERa and b-catenin) and
connects the estrogen and Wnt signaling circuitries.34
EZH2 also appears to regulate a broad cohort of genes
implicated in immunity and inflammation network,35
DNA repair mechanisms,30,36 and p53-regulated cell
cycle control;37 and EZH2 is linked functionally with
breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) expression.28
In view of the biologic role of EZH2 and the high
frequency of EZH2 expression in IBC tumors, blockade
of EZH2 may offer a promising therapeutic approach for
these patients. One anti-EZH2 strategy may be to manipulate microRNAs (miRNAs) that are involved in EZH2
regulation. For example, miRNA-101 reportedly
decreased the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells,38 and
diminished miRNA-101 expression led to increased
EZH2 expression and dysregulation of epigenetic pathways.39 Furthermore, miRNA-26a, which targets EZH2,
reportedly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and induced
tumor-specific apoptosis in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma.40,41
In conclusion, the current results indicated that
EZH2 is expressed frequently in IBC tumors and is associated not only with unfavorable prognostic variables but
also with significantly decreased survival. These findings
indicate that the clinical outcome of patients with IBC
can be stratified further on the basis of EZH2 status. Our

results extend previous studies in patients with breast carcinoma-NOS. Given the high frequency of expression of
EZH2 in IBC tumors, targeting EZH2 may provide a
novel way to improve the clinical outcome of patients
with IBC. A further study that includes patients with pretreated IBC tumors is warranted to further refine these
findings.
