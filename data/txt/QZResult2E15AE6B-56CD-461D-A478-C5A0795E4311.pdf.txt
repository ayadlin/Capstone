ABSTRACT
ASPP2 can bind to p53 and enhance the apoptotic capabilities of p53 by guiding
it to the promoters of pro-apoptotic genes. Here, ASPP2 overexpression for 24 hours
transiently induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells by enhancing the transactivation of
p53 on pro-apoptotic gene promoters. However, long-term ASPP2 overexpression
(more than 48 hours) failed to induce apoptosis because p53 was released from the
pro-apoptotic gene promoters. In non-apoptotic cells, nuclear EGFR induced SOS1
expression by directly binding to the SOS1 promoter. SOS1 activated the HRAS/
PI3K/AKT pathway and resulted in nuclear translocation of p-AKT and Bcl-2. The
interaction between p-AKT and ASPP2 facilitates Bcl-2 binding to p53, which releases
p53 from the pro-apoptotic gene promoters. The in vivo assay demonstrated that
EGFR/SOS1-promoted growth of nuclear p-AKT+, Bcl-2+ cells results in the resistance
of hepatoma cells to ASPP2-p53 complex-induced apoptosis and that blocking nuclear
translocation of EGFR dramatically improves and enhances the pro-apoptotic function
of ASPP2. Finally, the activation of the HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway by EGFR-induced
SOS1 also inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting a common apoptosisevasion mechanism in hepatoma cells. Because evasion of apoptosis contributes to
treatment resistance in hepatoma, our results also support further investigation of
combined therapeutic blockade of EGFR and SOS1.

region, an SH3 domain, and ankyrin repeats [5, 6] and
has previously been identified as an interacting partner
for Bcl-2 and p53 [7]. ASPP2 binds to p53 through its
C-terminus to stimulate the transactivation function of
p53 on the promoters of pro-apoptotic genes, e.g., PUMA
(p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis). ASPP2 is a
haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, and ASPP2+/- mice
are prone to developing cancer [8]. Our previous study
suggests a potential role of ASPP2 in inhibiting HCC by
promoting C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP)-mediated
autophagic apoptosis [9].
A clear link has been established between the PI3K/
AKT pathway and the pathogenesis of HCC [10]. AKT
is a key player in the PI3K pathway [11]. Activation of
AKT might predict poor prognosis in HCC [12]. Activated
HRAS can activate p110 PI3K in a p85 PI3K-dependent

INTRODUCTION
Apoptosis is involved in the regulation of
many physiological and pathological processes in
cells [1]. Insufficient apoptotic cell death promotes
tumorigenesis [2]. Moreover, evasion of apoptosis is
one of the hallmarks of tumors that result in treatment
resistance [2]. The discovery of apoptosis escape
mechanisms has great potential to help guide the design
of novel therapeutic strategies for human cancer [2].
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents one of
the most difficult cancers to treat [3], and the current
therapeutic strategies designed to induce apoptosis are still
not effective enough to completely cure HCC [4].

and -independent manner [13]. Constitutive activation of
the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway often enables cells to
proliferate in an uncontrolled manner.
The tumor suppressor p53 was proposed to activate
a cell cycle check and to induce apoptosis, whereas the
proto-oncogene Bcl-2 functions as an inhibitor of cell
death [14]. p53 inhibits Bcl-2 via promoting its antagonists
or via repressing Bcl-2 transcription in some settings [14].
In mitochondria, p53 directly binds to Bcl-2 via its DNAbinding domain and then induces apoptosis [15–17].
To our knowledge, this is the first report
demonstrating that nuclear EGFR can induce Son of
Sevenless 1 (SOS1) expression by directly binding to
the SOS1 promoter; SOS1 then impairs ASPP2-induced
apoptosis in hepatoma cells. We believe that our data
can explain some of the cases where p53 is normal but
apoptosis cannot be successfully induced in cancer cells.

overexpression-induced apoptosis could be detected at
16 and 24 hours but not at 48 and 72 hours (Figure 1A,
1B, 1C and 1D). ASPP2 overexpression also induced
apoptosis at 24 hours in PHCs but not at 48 and 72 hours
(Supplementary Figures 1). However, ASPP2 levels at
48 or 72 hours were higher than that at 24 hours in HepG2
and PHCs cells (Figures 1D and S1). Recombinant
adenovirus-Vector (rAd-Vector) had no effect on apoptosis
(Figures 1B, 1C and 1D).
PCR array and immunoblot assays showed that the
mRNA and protein levels of seven p53-regulated proapoptotic genes (DR5, APAF1, BAX, Caspase 9, El24,
TRAIL, and PUMA) were increased at 16 and 24 hours
(Figure S2A and S2B). Knockdown of the seven genes
via siRNAs revealed that the expressions of PUMA,
BAX and caspase 9 were mainly involved in ASPP2induced apoptosis at 24 hours (Figure S2C). Although
the ASPP2-p53 complex could be detected up to 72 hours
by a CO-IP assay, a luciferase assay showed that ASPP2
promoted PUMA expression only at 24 hours but not
at 48 and 72 hours (Figures 1E and 1F). Thus, ASPP2
overexpression for 24 hours transiently induces apoptosis
by enhancing the transactivation activation of p53.
However, the effect of long-term ASPP2 overexpression
(more than 48 hours) on inducing apoptosis is impaired in
hepatoma cells.

rAd-ASPP2 for 48 and 72 hours, as the levels of HRASGTP, p-PI3K and p-AKT were increased (Figure 2A).
siRNA knockdown of HRAS, PI3K, and AKT was able to
recover ASPP2-induced apoptosis at 48 hours (Figure 2B).
Here, nuclear translocation of Bcl-2 and p-AKT increased
after rAd-ASPP2 infection for 48 hours (Figure 2C).
Bcl-2 knockdown led to the recovery of ASPP2-induced
apoptosis at 48 and 72 hours (Figure 2D). A CO-IP assay
showed that nuclear Bcl-2, p-AKT, ASPP2 and p53 were
in a larger complex (Figure 2E). ChIP and luciferase
assays showed that knockdown of AKT or Bcl-2 recovered

interacted with ASPP2 and Bcl-2, but not AKT
(Figure  3A). Simultaneous culture of the recombinant
ASPP2 fragment (Re-ASPP2), Bcl-2 (Re-Bcl-2) and
GST-p53 showed that Bcl-2 competitively bound to
p53, which suppressed the formation of the ASPP2-p53
complex (Figure 3B). Interestingly, after co-culture of
Re-ASPP2, Re-Bcl-2, recombinant AKT (Re-AKT) and
GST-p53, the ASPP2-p53 complex could not be detected,
but the amount of p53-Bcl-2 complex was increased,

Bcl-2 and p53 (Figure 3B). Moreover, AKT directly
bound to ASPP2 and Bcl-2 and decreased the formation
of the ASPP2-Bcl-2 complex (Figures 3C and 3D). The
overexpressed mutant form of AKT (K179A, T308A,
S473A), which lacks the phosphorylation site, failed to be
translocated to nucleus, and nuclear AKT-ASPP2 complex
could not be detected, suggesting that phosphorylation of
AKT is critical for its nuclear translocation (Figure 3E).
The p53 DNA binding domain (p53DBD) is the binding
site for Bcl-2 [16, 19]. Our data suggest that nuclear p-AKT
facilitates the binding of Bcl-2 to p53DBD, which releases
p53 from the promoter region of PUMA (Figure 3F).

SOS1, RasGRP3, Ect2, and Collybistin were increased
in HepG2 cells after rAd-ASPP2 infection for 48 and
72 hours (Figure S3A). The protein levels of SOS1 and
Ect2 were also increased (Figure S3B). TUNEL assay
showed that only siRNA knockdown of SOS1 was able
to recover ASPP2-induced apoptosis at 48 and 72 hours
(Figures S3C). Flow cytometry and immunoblot assays
further showed that SOS1 knockdown recovered ASPP2induced apoptosis by inactivating the HRAS/PI3K/AKT
pathway (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C). SOS1 knockdown
also inhibited nuclear translocation of p-AKT and Bcl-2
(Figure 4D and 4E) and recovered PUMA expression at
72 hours (Figure 4F), suggesting that SOS1 inhibits the
binding of ASPP2-p53 complex to the promoter of PUMA
by inducing nuclear translocation of p-AKT and Bcl-2.

SOS1 activates the HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway
and is critical for nuclear translocation of p-AKT
and Bcl-2

ASPP2 overexpression increased activated-HRAS
levels (Figure 2A). HRAS is inactivated and activated
by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), respectively [20, 21].
We employed real-time PCR to detect 40 GAP and
GEF genes and determined that the mRNA levels of

ASPP2 overexpression enhanced EGF and EGFR
expression at 48 and 72 hours (Figure S2A and S2B), and
knockdown of EGF or EGFR recovered ASPP2-induced

also activates HRAS [21]. Erlotinib-induced inhibition of
EGFR tyrosine kinase activity did not inactivate the HRAS/
PI3K/AKT pathway and did not change SOS1 expression
(Figure 5A, 5B and 5E). The binding of EGF to EGFR can
induce nuclear translocation of EGFR [22]. An ne-EGFR was
used to block the interaction between EGF and EGFR.­
ne-EGFR treatment inactivated the HRAS/PI3K/AKT
pathway and decreased SOS1 expression (Figure 5C, 5D
and 5F), indicating that nuclear EGFR might be required to
induce SOS1 expression. Immunoblot and IF assays showed
that nuclear translocation of EGFR was truly increased at 48
and 72 hours (Figure 6A and 6B), and ne-EGFR treatment
decreased nuclear EGFR (Figure S4A). Real-time PCR, IF
and immunoblot assays further showed that siRNA-mediated
EGFR knockdown decreased SOS1 mRNA and protein
levels (Figures 6C, 6D and S4B). EGFR overexpression
increased SOS1 luciferase activity (Figure 6E). Finally, a
ChIP assay demonstrated that nuclear EGFR bound to the
SOS1 promoter at 48 and 72 hours (Figure 6F). Thus, nuclear
EGFR promotes SOS1 expression by directly binding to the
promoter region of SOS1, which leads to SOS1-mediated
activation of the HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway.

with ne-EGFR, but not erlotinib, effectively induced
apoptotic cell death in HepG2 in vitro (Figure S5A, S5B,
7A and  7B). Nude mice were injected subcutaneously
with HepG2 cells. EGFR levels were increased in the
transplanted tumor treated with rAd-ASPP2 (Figure S5C).
rAd-ASPP2 treatment significantly inhibited tumor
growth, but treatment with rAd-ASPP2 combined with
ne-EGFR was a more powerful inhibitor of transplanted
tumor growth than rAd-ASPP2 treatment alone or rAdASPP2 combined with erlotinib (Figure 7C) because neEGFR extended and amplified ASPP2-induced apoptosis
(Figure S5D).
It has been shown that ASPP2 overexpression
reduces Bcl-2 levels, but the remaining Bcl-2 translocates
to the nucleus [9]. p-AKTHIGH, Bcl-2LOW cells (representing
nuclear p-AKT+, Bcl-2+ cells) were isolated and used
for subcutaneous injection for 2 weeks. p-AKTHIGH,
Bcl-2LOW cells grew faster than wild-type HepG2 cells
(Figure  7D). EGFR and SOS1 levels were found to be
higher in the p-AKTHIGH, Bcl-2LOW HepG2-transplanted
tumor than in the wild type HepG2 tumor (Figure 7D).
rAd-ASPP2 combined with ne-EGFR, but not rAd-ASPP2
treatment alone, inhibited the growth of p-AKTHIGH,
Bcl-2LOW cells (Figure 7D). EGFR (EGFR kd), SOS1

almost completely  inhibited their growth (Figure  7E).

overexpression induces apoptotic cell death in HepG2 and
PHCs by enhancing p53 activity. Two principle apoptosis
signaling pathways have been delineated: extrinsic
(death receptor) pathway and intrinsic (mitochondrial)
pathway [1]. In this study, DR5 (representing the extrinsic
pathway) had little effect on ASPP2-induced apoptosis,
but PUMA, BAX and caspase 9 (representing the intrinsic
pathway) were the main pro-apoptotic factors involved in
ASPP2-induced apoptosis.
However, long-term ASPP2 overexpression (more
than 48 hours) fails to induce apoptosis in HepG2 and
PHCs, suggesting that hepatoma cells can also prevent
long-term apoptotic stimuli. We believe that the plausible
molecular mechanism in our setting is as follows: after
long-term ASPP2 overexpression, the expression of EGF
and EGFR is induced and EGFR is translocated to the
nucleus by interaction with EGF. In the nucleus, EGFR
induces SOS1 expression by directly binding to the SOS1
promoter. SOS1 then activates the HRAS/PI3K/AKT
pathway, which results in the nuclear translocation of
p-AKT and Bcl-2. In the nucleus, the interaction between
p-AKT and ASPP2 facilitates the direct interaction of Bcl-2
and p53, which impairs the formation of the ASPP2-p53
complex and then releases p53 from the pro-apoptotic
gene promoters. Because p53 cannot bind to pro-apoptotic
gene promoters, ASPP2 overexpression-induced apoptosis
is blocked (Figure 7F). In addition, we also observed the
same mechanism by which HepG2 cells are resistant to
cisplatin treatment, suggesting that this new mechanism
might be a common mechanism by which hepatoma cells
produce an anti-apoptotic response when faced with proapoptotic signals.
Previous studies have reported that mitochondrial
Bcl-2 plays an anti-apoptotic role by inhibiting p53induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer
membrane through direct binding with p53 [23]. We have
previously demonstrated that ASPP2 overexpression
reduces Bcl-2 levels by an unknown mechanism [9]. Here,
we further determine that the presence of nuclear p-AKT is
critical for nuclear Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis by blocking
the interaction between p53 and the pro-apoptotic gene
promoters via the Bcl-2-p53 interaction. The p53 DNA
binding domain is the binding interface for Bcl-2 [16], and
therefore, Bcl-2 can block p53 transactivation activity. Our
data are consistent with the conclusion that the ratio of
anti-apoptotic versus pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, rather
than the expression levels of one particular molecular of
the Bcl-2 family, regulates apoptosis sensitivity [2].
The nuclear translocation of p-AKT and Bcl-2 is
directly responsible for the inhibition of ASPP2-induced
apoptosis. Recombinant ASPP2 contains ankyrin repeats
and SH3 domains, which are required for its specific
interaction with p53 [5]. The proline-rich region in
the C-terminus of AKT binds SH3 domain-containing
proteins, explaining why AKT directly binds ASPP2 [24].
Moreover, the ankyrin repeats and SH3 domains in the

Activation of the HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway
by nuclear EGFR-induced SOS1 also impairs
the pro-apoptotic function of cisplatin in
HepG2 cells
To detect whether the activation of the SOS1/
HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway could impair other proapoptotic signals, we treated HepG2 cells with cisplatin.
Apoptosis was detected at 24 and 48 hours using
TUNEL assay, but the level of apoptosis at 48 hours was
significantly decreased compared to that observed at
24 hours (Supplementary Figure 6A). Cisplatin treatment
also increased the expression of EGF, EGFR and SOS1
and activated the HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway at 48 hours,
while knockdown of HRAS, PI3K or AKT enhanced
cisplatin-induced apoptosis at 48 hours (Supplementary
Figure 6A, 6B). The CO-IP assay showed that the level
of ASPP2-p53 complex at 48 hours was the same as that
at 24 hours (Supplementary Figure 6C). However, there
was less p53 binding to the PUMA promoter and less
PUMA expression at 48 hours compared to 24 hours,
and knocking down HRAS, PI3K or AKT promoted
the interaction between p53 and the PUMA promoter
and increased PUMA expression, suggesting that p53 is
released from the PUMA promoter at 48 hours in a HRAS/
PI3K/AKT pathway-dependent manner (Supplementary
Figure 6D).
Cisplatin treatment also induced nuclear
translocation of EGFR, p-AKT and Bcl-2 at 48 hours
(Supplementary Figure 7A). siRNA knockdown of EGFR,
SOS1 or Bcl-2 enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis,
PUMA expression and the binding of p53 to the PUMA
promoter at 48 hours (Supplementary Figure 7B).
Cisplatin treatment also induced the binding of EGFR to
SOS1 promoter at 48 hours (Supplementary Figure 7C).
SOS1 mRNA and protein levels significantly increased at
48 hours, and EGFR knockdown reduced SOS1 mRNA
levels, suggesting that EGFR directly induces SOS1
expression at 48 hours in cisplatin-treated HepG2 cells
(Supplementary Figure 6B and 7D). Thus, activation of
the HRAS/PI3K/AKT pathway by nuclear EGFR-induced
SOS1 might be a general apoptosis-evasion mechanism in
HCC in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli.

DISCUSSION
Induction of p53-mediated apoptosis can be used to
treat tumors (including HCC). Because ASPP2 has been
reported to enhance the transactivation activity of p53
and subsequently the expression of pro-apoptotic genes,

C-terminus of ASPP2 not only bind p53 but are also
required to bind Bcl-2 [25]. Our data show that although
Bcl-2 cannot completely block the interaction between
ASPP2 and p53, in the presence of AKT, Bcl-2 almost
completely blocks the interaction between ASPP2 and
p53. We believe that the presence of AKT facilitates the
interaction between Bcl-2 and p53.
In our setting, EGFR-induced SOS1 expression
is critical for activating the HRA/PI3K/AKT pathway
and maintaining nuclear translocation of p-AKT and
Bcl-2. EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is not critical
for the survival of non-apoptotic cells, but the nuclear
translocation of EGFR is required for producing the antiapoptotic response. Nuclear EGFR binds to the promoter
of SOS1 and induces SOS1 expression. SOS1 activates
HRAS and then activates the PI3K/AKT pathway. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to identify that EGFR is
involved in directly regulating SOS1 expression.
Although sorafenib has been demonstrated to
significantly improve the overall survival of patients
with advanced HCC, alternative and more active agents
targeting novel signaling pathways are still necessary
for improving systemic therapy in HCC [26]. One of
the hallmarks of tumors is the intrinsic or acquired
resistance to apoptosis. Evasion of apoptosis may
contribute to carcinogenesis, tumor progression and
treatment resistance [2]. Some apoptosis mediators help
determine whether cells undergo successful apoptosis or
an unsuccessful one, and they sometimes act as targets
for drug discovery [27]. Although EGFR blockage can
enhance apoptosis susceptibility in tumor cells [28], our
data demonstrate that blocking EGFR tyrosine kinase by
erlotinib fails to recover ASPP2 overexpression-induced
apoptosis in HCC. A previous study also reported that
adding erlotinib to sorafenib does not improve survival in
patients with advanced HCC [29], suggesting that EGFR
signaling is not the right pathway to target [26]. However,
our data that nuclear translocation of EGFR plays an
anti-apoptotic role in HCC suggest that blocking nuclear
translocation of EGFR might be an alternative way to treat
HCC. To our knowledge, SOS1 has rarely been the focus
in HCC research. In our study, SOS1 expression appears to
be involved in nuclear EGFR-mediated apoptosis evasion.
Recently, EGFR has been reported to use SOS1 to drive
constitutive activation of Nuclear Factor κB (NFκB) in
cancer cells [30]. NFκB is abnormally constitutively
activated in most cancers (including HCC) and it always
plays a role for promoting resistance to apoptosis and
contributing to tumorigenesis [30, 31]. Thus, SOS1 is an
important downstream protein of EGFR, and it is rational
to develop a SOS1 inhibitor for HCC treatment. This is
supported by the fact that our in vivo and in vitro results
demonstrate that blocking nuclear translocation of EGFR
dramatically improves the pro-apoptotic function of
ASPP2 by reducing SOS1 expression.

Taken together, we believe that our data could
explain some of the cases where p53 is normal but
apoptosis cannot be successfully induced. Furthermore,
our data suggest that rAd-ASPP2 combined with ne-EGFR
might be used to treat HCC effectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture of HepG2 and human primary hepatoma
cells (PHCs), transfection of plasmids and siRNAs,
cisplatin treatment, immunoblotting, real-time PCR and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were
performed as previously described [9, 18], The effects
of recombinant adenovirus-ASPP2 (rAd-ASPP2), rAdASPP2 combined with anti-EGFR neutralizing antibody
(ne-EGFR) or erlotinib on inhibiting tumor growth were
detected in HepG2-transplanted xenograft tumors. For
more detailed methods, see Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
