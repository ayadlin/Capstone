ABSTRACT
Treatment with EGFR kinase inhibitors improves progression-free survival of
patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. However, all patients with initial response
will eventually acquire resistance and die from tumor recurrence. We found that
intermittent high-dose treatment with erlotinib induced apoptosis more potently
and improved tumor shrinkage significantly than the established low doses. In mice
carrying EGFR-mutant xenografts intermittent high-dose treatment (200 mg/kg every
other day) was tolerable and prolonged progression-free survival and reduced the
frequency of acquired resistance. Intermittent EGFR-targeted high-dose schedules
induce more profound as well as sustained target inhibition and may afford enhanced
therapeutic efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

15] that activate phosphatidyl-inositide-3 kinase (PI3K)
signaling, or by processes changing cellular differentiation
[16]. Both the T790M mutation and MET amplification
may exist in a subclone present at the time of therapy;
thus, a proportion of cases of resistance are likely to occur
due to clonal selection of such resistant subclones under
therapy [17, 18].
It was recently proposed that high-dose pulses of
kinase inhibitors lead to enhanced target suppression and
eradication of tumor cells more effectively by more potent

EGFR kinase inhibitors have become routine
treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer [14]. However, resistance will ultimately emerge, thereby
limiting the overall efficacy of such treatment. Resistance
may emerge due to EGFR second site mutations, mainly
the T790M-gatekeeper mutation, which prevents binding
of the typical quinazoline-based compounds [5-8], due
to genome alterations such as amplification of MET [9www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induction of apoptosis [19]. As a consequence, intermittent
high-dose schedules were shown to enhance efficacy in
ERBB2-amplified breast cancer [20] as well as in BRAFmutant melanomas [21]. In a cancer evolution modeling
approach an intermittent scheduling of erlotinib could
prevent the appearance of resistance despite the presence
of EGFRT790M positive subclones ab initio [22, 23].
Since the duration of target suppression is likely
to affect the efficacy of a given compound in addition
to the magnitude of target inhibition [24, 25] we sought
to determine, whether enhanced trough levels or peak
plasma levels might be more relevant to offer enhanced
therapeutic efficacy.

although this effect was more pronounced in PC9
xenografts (Figure S3). Again, H1975 was unresponsive
to therapy using any of these schedules (Figure 1C and
Figure S3, right panels).

Toxicity as well as pharmacokinetic aspects of
high-dose pulse treatment
Alignment of murine and human EGFR revealed
only one different amino acid in the kinase domain
(Y > F at 771), which is unlikely to affect binding of
erlotinib (Figure S4A). Thus, erlotinib is expected to
inhibit EGFR signaling in all murine tissues, in which
EGFR is expressed. We found that mice treated with
100mg/kg erlotinib daily lost about 20% of weight. The
intermittent_2day schedule led to an initial weight loss of
10%, too, but mice typically recovered within 20 days.
Mice treated with 50mg/kg daily and the intermittent_4day
schedule initially showed a slight reduction of weight of
about 5%, but recovered within 10 days. Mice treated
with 15mg/kg or 30mg/kg daily and the control group
did not exhibit significant weight loss (Figure 2A).
Both the 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg daily schedules were
highly toxic: severe diarrhea occurred in 88% and 73%
of mice, respectively. By contrast, diarrhea occurred in
49% of the mice in the intermittend_2day and 20% of the
intermittend_4day groups (Figure S4B). In the 100mg/kg
daily group significantly more mice died during therapy
than in the other groups (Figure S4C). Rash occurred
in 38% of mice in the 100mg/kg daily cohort, whereas
rash was rare in the mice treated with the other schedules
(Figure S4D). There was no case of diarrhea or rash in
the control group. Thus, intermittent high-dose treatment
of EGFR-mutant tumors with erlotinib enhanced tumor
control with limited toxicity.
Estimates for erlotinib peak plasma concentrations
after a single dose of 30mg/kg or 200mg/kg of erlotinib
were 6.5µmol/l and 11.7µmol/l, respectively. The area
under the curve (AUC) showed linear increase with the
dose (3.84µmol*h vs. 24.45µmol*h (p < 0.001)). Thus,
erlotinib clearance was independent on the dose (2.72l/h
vs. 3.05l/h (p = 0.45)); however, the apparent absorption
rate constant was much higher for the low dose (0.36/h
vs. 0.08/h (p < 0.001)), suggesting some saturation of
absorbtion of erlotinib in the intestine (Figure 2B). The
concentrations of erlotinib in tumor lysates of HCC827,
PC9 and H1975 xenografts peaked after 6 hours. In mice
treated with 30mg/kg of erlotinib the peak concentrations
reached about 100ng of erlotinib/µg of protein and
declined after 12 hours. Treatment with 200mg/kg led
to peak tumor tissue concentrations of 200-250ng/µg.
In muscle tissue concentrations were lower, suggesting
enrichment in tumor tissue (Figure 2C). The peak
tumor concentrations of the active metabolite OSI-420
were about 10ng/µg for 30mg/kg erlotinib and declined

RESULTS
High dose pulses of erlotinib potently inhibit
tumorcell growth of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell
lines in vivo and in vitro
In line with a recent report [19] 20 minutes of
treatment with 10µM of erlotinib potently suppressed
tumor cell growth of the erlotinib sensitive cell lines
HCC827 and PC9 (both carry EGFR exon 19 deletion
mutations) as effectively as a continuous 72 hours
exposure with 0.1µM. As expected, any such treatment
had minor effect on the resistant cell lines H1975 (EGFR
L858R and T790M) and HCC827GR (EGFR exon 19
deletion, MET-amplified) (Figure S1), thus confirming that
efficacy was due to on-target activity of the compound.
A pulse of 10µM of erlotinib reduced pAkt and pErk1/2
levels in the sensitive cell lines, despite re-establishment
of pEGFR signaling (Figure 1A, upper panels).
Continuous exposure to erlotinib inhibited pEGFR, pAkt
and pErk1/2 levels at a concentration of 0.1µM. Again,
downstream signaling was only slightly reduced in the
two resistant control cell lines (Figure 1A, lower panels).
Phosphorylated levels of MET were reduced in HCC827,
PC9 and H1975 cells by high concentrations of erlotinib,
but not in the MET-amplified cell line HCC827GR (Figure
S2). Induction of apoptosis (Figure 1A, 1B) was also
similar in the sensitive cells treated with a high-dose pulse
of 10µM for 20 minutes and those treated with 0.1µM, but
not in the resistant ones.
Given the high efficacy of high-dose treatment of
erlotinib in EGFR-mutant tumor cells in vitro, we tested
whether pulsatile high doses of erlotinib enhanced tumor
control in vivo. Tumor shrinkage occurred more rapidly
and was of greater magnitude in tumor xenografts of PC9
and HCC827 cells treated with intermittent high doses of
erlotinib (200mg/kg every other day, “intermittent_2day”)
than in those treated daily with 30mg/kg (Figure 1C).
Treatment with either 15mg/kg daily or 200mg/kg every
fourth day (“intermittent_4day”) were less effective,

completely within 24 hours, and reached 30 to 50ng/
µg in tumor tissue and about 20ng/µg in muscle tissue
for the 200mg/kg dose (Figure S5). We finally assessed
the pharmacodynamic effects of high-dose treatment
in tumors explanted from treated mice by pEGFRimmunohistochemistry. In the sensitive HCC827- and
PC9-xenografts both 30mg/kg and 200mg/kg of erlotinib
reduced pEGFR compared to untreated controls and the
resistant H1975-xenografts. However single dosing of
200mg/kg of erlotinib reduced pEGFR much stronger than
30mg/kg (Figure 2D).

are individually shown in Figure 4A. After initial response
several tumors restarted to grow. However, in the case of
HCC827 xenografts treated with 200mg/kg every second
day no resistance emerged, whereas 40% of the tumors
treated with 30mg/kg daily became resistant (p < 0.05).
PC9-xenografts showed acquired resistance in both
therapy groups; however, recurrence occurred later (Figure
4A, right) and progression-free survival was longer in the
group receiving intermittent high-dose treatment (p <
0.05) (Figure 4B).
Sequencing of tumors explanted at the time of
resistance revealed the T790M resistance mutation in PC9
xenografts (Figure S10). These results show that more
pronounced target suppression not only leads to higher
magnitude, but also greater duration of response.

In vivo pharmacodynamic assessments by
18F-FLT-PET
We have recently shown in mice and in patients that
erlotinib induces early cell cycle arrest in EGFR-mutant
tumors that precedes induction of apoptosis and that can
be monitored in vivo using 18F-FLT-PET [26, 27]. We
therefore determined, whether the dynamics of induction
of cell cycle arrest and tumor shrinkage might also be
similar in the 30mg/kg daily and the intermittend_2day
schedules. While in H1975 xenografts uptake of 18F-FLT
was not reduced by erlotinib treatment (Figure 3A, lower
panel, Figure 3B, right panel, Figure S6 and S7), the
decrease in relative FLT-uptake was similar in both the
continuous 30mg/kg and the intermittent_2day schedules
in HCC827 and PC9 xenografts (Figure 3A, upper panel,
Figure 3B left panel, Figure 3C and Figure S6 and S7).
In PC9 tumors the intermittent_4day showed a similar
decline in FLT-uptake at days 1, 6 and 8; however 18F-FLTuptake increased again at days 20 and 27, but not in the
continuous_30mg/kg and intermittent_2day group (p
< 0.05) (Figure 3C). This observation corroborates the
notion that both high trough and peak levels of erlotinib
are relevant for cell cycle arrest [28, 29] and tumor
shrinkage.

DISCUSSION
Here we present a strategy for improving therapeutic
efficacy in a xenograft model of EGFR-mutant lung cancer
by intermittent high-dose scheduling of erlotinib. This
schedule was tolerable, but enhanced both the magnitude
and the duration of response. Despite the high dose,
efficacy was due to on-target effects of erlotinib as the
treatment effects were not observed in cells bearing the
T790M resistance mutation.
We could show that plasma peak levels of erlotinib
after a dose of 200mg/kg were only two fold higher than
after 30mg/kg indicating saturation of absorption. By
contrast, the AUC was about 6-fold higher suggesting that
the duration of target suppression was increased severalfold. As a consequence we found for pulsatile high-dose
treatment of erlotinib stronger and more durable target
suppression by pEGFR-staining, and could show sufficient
cell-cycle-arrest in-vivo by 18F-FLT-PET.
Consequently, intermittent high-dose treatment
improved the progression-free survival in two EGFRmutant xenografts in a long-term treatment study. While
emergence of resistance was completely abolished in
HCC827 xenografts, resistance occurred less frequently
and at a later time in PC9 xenografts. The latter are known
to become resistant to erlotinib over time due to emergence
of the T790M resistance mutation; thus, the efficacy of
reversible quinazoline EGFR inhibitors will always be
limited in these tumors. In line with these findings we
could detect the T790M mutation in resistant PC9 tumors,
but not in HCC827 tumors. However, the observation that
PFS could still be improved in PC9 tumors may arguably
be due to the possibility that high doses of erlotinib are
still capable of inhibiting T790M-mutant EGFR to some
extent (note that the biochemical IC50 of erlotinib for
EGFRT790M is still in the nanomolar range).
In a first study in humans treated with an intermittent
high-dose schedule of erlotinib, patient suffered only
moderate side-effects [30]. The limited efficacy in this
study is likely due to the lack of patient selection based on

Intermittent high-dose erlotinib treatment
improves progression-free survival of mice
bearing EGFR-mutant xenografts.
High doses of erlotinib improved tumor shrinkage
by enhanced target signaling suppression. Efficacy of
EGFR inhibitors is ultimately limited by the emergence
of resistance. We therefore tested the hypothesis that
intermittent high dose treatment of EGFR-mutant tumors
might also enhance the duration of response. Mice
engrafted with HCC827 or PC9 cells were therefore
treated with the most effective, but still tolerable schedules
for up to 400 days: 30mg/kg erlotinib daily or 200mg/
kg erlotinib every other day. Median follow-up time
for HCC827 was 280 (continuous_30mg/kg) and 400
(intermittent_2day) days and for PC9 102 and 160 days,
respectively (Figure S9). All tumor volumes of these mice

EGFR mutations. Thus, patients with EGFR-mutant lung
cancer may benefit from high-dose treatment with EGFR
inhibitors at reasonable toxicity. In line with this notion,
Riely and colleagues showed in a recent phase II study,

that OS of patients can be prolonged by a high-dose pulse
of erlotinib before chemotherapy, without increasing toxic
side effects [31]. Patients on this trial were not selected
based on EGFR mutations either. Thus, patients with

EGFR-mutant lung cancer may derive further benefit from
such intermittent high-dose schedule. However, in these
studies no pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated
with high-dose erlotinib were performed. Further studies
are required to determine peak and AUC levels during
high dose erlotinib treatment and to evaluate whether these
high dose erlotinib levels in mice are tolerable in humans.
Finally, these high doses of erlotinib may penetrate the
blood-brain barrier and induce tumor shrinkage in EGFRmutant brain metastases, which are usually not tractable
by standard dosing of erlotinib [32].
In summary, we provide evidence that intermittent
high-dose treatment of EGFR-mutant tumors with
erlotinib enables enhanced tumor shrinkage and prolonged
PFS, while limiting toxicity in a mouse xenograft
study. This effect is associated with high trough and
peak levels, which induced more durable shutdown of
EGFR-associated oncogenic signaling. While treatment
is increasingly tailored to each patient based on tumor
genotyping, the established 150mg once daily dose of
erlotinib may simply not be the ideal schedule for optimal
target shutdown and tumor control. Thus, protocols testing
such intermittent high dose pulses of erlotinib specifically
in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer warrant clinical
exploration.

Flow cytometryofHCC827, PC9, H1975 and
HCC827GR cells treated with erlotinib (0.1µM, 1µM
or 10µM) or DMSO for either 20 minutes or 24 hours,
was performed using the AnnexinV-FITC Apoptosis
Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, Germany) according
to the manufactures protocol and measured by Gallios
Flow Cytometer (Beckmann Coulter), detecting at least
100,000 events per probe. Data was evaluated by setting
appropriate gates in Kaluza analysis software (Beckman
Coulter) and apoptosis was calculated as the difference
between sample and DMSO control.

In vivo experiments
All animal procedures were approved by the local
animal protection committee and the local authorities.
All experiments were performed in 10 to 15 week
old male athymic NMRI-nude-mice (Janvier, Europe) as
described recently [26, 33]. For creation of xenografts
tumor cells (HCC827, PC9 and H1975) were implanted
subcutaneously. Therapy was started when tumors reached
a size of approx. 100mm³. Mice were treated by oral
gavage of erlotinib in these schedules: 15mg/kg daily,
30mg/kg daily, 200mg/kg every 2nd day or 200mg/kg
every 4th day or 100µl vehicle detergent daily.
Tumor size was monitored every 2nd day by
calimetric measurement. Tumor volumes were calculated
by the modified ellipsoid formula [V = 0.5 x (long
diameter) x (short diameter)²]. All absolute tumor volumes
were set relative to day 0.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell-culture and reagents
The human NSCLC celllines PC9, HCC827
and H1975 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), HCC827GR were kindly
provided by the laboratory of Jeff Engelman. Cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FCS and 1%
Penicillin+Streptomycin.
Erlotinib was purchased from LC Labs, USA. For
in-vitro studies erlotinib was prepared in stock solution of
10mM in DMSO (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) and stored
at -20°C. For in-vivo studies erlotinib was dissolved in
6% Captisol® (CyDex Inc., USA) in concentrations of
10mg/ml (continuous schedules) or 30mg/ml (intermittent
schedules) and stored in a rotating device at 4°C.

Toxicity of erlotinib in mice
Human and murine EGFR were aligned using the
ClustalW-alignment (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/
clustalw2) and performed an analysis of erlotinib binding
to the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR. To assess the
tolerable therapy schedules of erlotinib we treated nontumor harboring mice with these schedules of erlotinib:
15mg/kg, 30mg/kg, 50mg/kg or 100mg/kg daily, or with
200mg/kg every 2nd or 4th day, as well as with vehicle
detergent alone daily. Weight was measured every 2nd
day and toxic side effects (diarrhea, rash and death) in all
treated mice were monitored.

Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed using the following
antibodies: pEGFR (Y1068), EGFR, pAkt (S473), AKT,
pErk 44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204), ERK 44/42, Caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technologies, USA), ß-actin (clone C4)
(MP Biomedicals LLC, USA), anti-rabbit-HRP- and antimouse-HRP-antibody (Millipore, Germany).

For pharmacokinetic analyses mice were treated
with a single dose of either 30mg/kg or 200mg/kg
erlotinib. Blood samples were taken from the tail-vein
and erlotinib plasma concentrations were quantified using
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with a

Statistical analysis

6.	

For statistical analyses we used Sigma Plot
11.0 (Systat Software, USA). We used student’s t-test
(unpaired, 2-sided), χ2-test and log-rank-test. p < 0.05 was
considered statistical significant.
For further details we refer to Supplementary
Methods.
