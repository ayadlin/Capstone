Fructose Induces Transketolase Flux to Promote
Pancreatic Cancer Growth

Abstract
Carbohydrate metabolism via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is pivotal for cancer growth, and
increased refined carbohydrate consumption adversely affects cancer survival. Traditionally, glucose and fructose have been considered as interchangeable monosaccharide substrates that are similarly metabolized, and
little attention has been given to sugars other than glucose. However, fructose intake has increased dramatically in recent decades and cellular uptake of glucose and fructose uses distinct transporters. Here, we report
that fructose provides an alternative substrate to induce pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. Importantly,
fructose and glucose metabolism are quite different; in comparison with glucose, fructose induces thiaminedependent transketolase flux and is preferentially metabolized via the nonoxidative pentose phosphate
pathway to synthesize nucleic acids and increase uric acid production. These findings show that cancer cells
can readily metabolize fructose to increase proliferation. They have major significance for cancer patients
given dietary refined fructose consumption, and indicate that efforts to reduce refined fructose intake or inhibit fructose-mediated actions may disrupt cancer growth. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6368–76. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Cell immortalization and malignant transformation are
predominantly determined by altered or aberrant gene
expression that in turn modifies cellular metabolic pathways
to support tumor growth, viability, and spread. Consequently,
cancer cells typically have abnormal metabolism and consume glucose avidly to produce high quantities of lactic acid
even in the presence of adequate oxygen, a process first
noted by Warburg and colleagues (1). The nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which allows six-carbon
glucose conversion to five-carbon ribose for DNA or RNA
synthesis, is of utmost importance for the proliferation process and produces >85% of the ribose recovered from tumor
nucleic acids (2). The nonoxidative PPP, controlled by transketolase (TK) enzyme reactions, is encoded by three human
TK genes: TKT, TKTL1, and TKTL2 (3, 4). Clinically, patients
with extensive cancer burden have a tendency to develop
thiamine depletion, which is a cofactor for TK-mediated

reactions, emphasizing the importance of the nonoxidative
PPP for tumor growth. Increased obesity due to increased
total energy consumption and reduced activity now contributes to 15% of U.S. cancer deaths (5, 6). In addition to higher
fat intake, a large increase in refined carbohydrate intake
has occurred, which itself has been hypothesized to be a
risk factor for several cancers (7, 8). Eighty percent of this
carbohydrate derives from added sweeteners, in which the
disaccharide sucrose (50% glucose and 50% fructose) and
high-fructose corn syrup (45% glucose and 55% fructose)
are the main sugars (9, 10). Increased refined fructose consumption, in particular, has been highlighted as conferring
greater pancreatic cancer risk than other sugars in several
recent large epidemiologic studies (11, 12). Normal physiologic glucose concentration, a key substrate for cancer
metabolism through glycolysis in the cytosol and through
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria, is tightly
controlled between 5 and 7 mmol/L by several hormones,
including insulin and glucagon, but little is known about
human circulating serum fructose levels (13). We recently
observed that mean circulating fasting fructose levels were
2.5 times higher in pancreatic cancer patients in comparison
with fasting serum fructose levels in healthy subjects who
were in the 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/L range (14). The role, if any,
of fructose as a substrate in cancer is poorly understood.
The present study shows that pancreatic cancer cells grow
in a range of fructose concentrations that are attainable with
the current Western diet and at equivalent rates to glucose.
Of major importance, we show that pancreatic cancer
metabolism of fructose and glucose is very different, as fructose is a potent inducer of TKT and is preferentially used in
the nonoxidative PPP to generate increased nucleic acids in
comparison with glucose.

Fructose Induces Pancreatic Cancer Growth

Materials and Methods
Cells
Human pancreatic cancer (CaPan-I, CaPan-II, HPAF2,
Aspc1, Panc-1, and MiaPaCa-2) and hepatoblastoma (HepG2)
cell lines were purchased in 2009 and 2010 from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and used in the described
experiments within 6 months after purchase. Authentication
testing was performed by ATCC and includes (a) certification
that each cell line is negative for Mycoplasma, bacteria, and
fungi contamination; (b) confirmation of species identity and
detection of possible cellular contamination or misidentification using Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I (COI) for interspecies identification and short tandem repeat (STR) analysis
(DNA profiling) for intraspecies identification; and (c) conducting of additional test methods, such as cytogenetic analysis (G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization), flow
cytometry, and immunocytochemistry as well as consistent
refinement of cell growth conditions as well as documentation systems, ensuring traceability.
The immortalized pancreatic epithelial cell line HPDE6
was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Pandol (Veteran's Administration Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA), and all experiments were performed within five passages (15). For primary
cultures, freshly resected pancreatic tumors or adjacent normal pancreas tissues were mechanically and enzymatically
(trypsin and DNase) disaggregated, and aliquots of tumor
cells were seeded in six-well plates. Cell viability was confirmed using a viability kit (Molecular Probes), and keratin
staining was used to confirm that >98% of the isolated pancreatic cancer cells were of epithelial origin. Cell aliquots
were then incubated in standard DMEM in a range of fetal
bovine serum (FBS) concentrations (1–10%) and in a range
of glucose or fructose concentrations for 24 to 72 hours.
In vitro proliferation assays
For CellTiter-Glo (CTG; Promega), fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS), and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) proliferation assays, 1 × 104 cells were preincubated in standard
medium containing 10% FBS (which contains ∼0.4 mmol/L
glucose) overnight and then plated in a range of glucose- or
fructose-containing standard media in 96-well plates for 12
to 96 hours. For CTG assays, proliferation rates were measured
according to the manufacturer's instructions. For FACS analysis, treated cells were trypsinized, centrifuged (1,500 rpm ×
2 minutes), washed with PBS, and treated with 20 g/mL RNase
A (Calbiochem). DNA was stained with 100 μg/mL propidium
iodide for 30 minutes at 4°C and protected from light before
analysis with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). For BrdUrd
uptake assays, BrdUrd (10 μmol/L) was added in the final
12 hours of incubation in the sugars, following which BrdUrd
uptake was quantified.
Metabolomic studies
Confluent cultures (75%) of pancreatic cancer (Panc-1 and
MiaPaCa-2), hepatoblastoma (HepG2), and normal pancreatic ductal (HPDE6) cells (3 × 106) were incubated for 24
and 72 hours in 5 mmol/L [1,2-13C2]D-glucose–containing or

www.aacrjournals.org

5 mmol/L [1,2-13C2]D-fructose–containing (>99% purity and
99% isotope enrichment for each carbon position; Cambridge
Isotope Labs) media (half unlabeled glucose/fructose, half labeled with the 13C tracer) in T75 culture flasks. Where possible, these studies were also performed in primary
pancreatic tumor and normal pancreas cultures. Briefly, following glucose or fructose treatment, culture medium was
collected and cells were washed twice in PBS, after which
cell pellets were harvested, specific extractions were performed as described below, and mass spectral data were
obtained on a HP5975 inert XL mass selective detector
connected to an HP6890N gas chromatograph. A HP-5 capillary column was used for the glucose, ribose, and lactate
analyses. Lactate was extracted from cell culture media
(0.2 mL) by ethylene chloride after acidification with HCl, derivatized to its propylamine-heptafluorobutyrate ester form,
and applied to the column. The m/z 328 (carbons 1–3 of lactate; chemical ionization) were monitored for the detection
of m1 (recycled lactate through the PC) and m2 (lactate produced by the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway) for the
estimation of pentose cycle activity. For analysis of fatty acid
synthesis, palmitate, stearate, cholesterol, and oleate were
extracted after saponification of cell pellets in 30% KOH
and 100% ethanol using petroleum ether. Fatty acids were
then converted to their methylated derivative using 0.5 N
methanolic-HCl, and palmitate, stearate, and oleate were
monitored at m/z 270, m/z 298, and m/z 264, respectively,
with the enrichment of 13C-labeled acetyl units to reflect synthesis, elongation, and desaturation of the new lipid fraction
as determined by mass isotopomer distribution analysis
(MIDA). To compare ribose and deoxyribose synthesis,
RNA ribose was isolated by acid hydrolysis of cellular RNA
after Trizol purification of cell extracts. Total RNA was first
quantified by spectrophotometric determination in triplicate
cultures, and ribose was then derivatized to its aldonitrile
acetate form using hydroxylamine in pyridine with acetic anhydride (Supelco) before mass spectral analyses. The ion cluster was monitored around the m/z 256 (carbons 1–5 of ribose;
chemical ionization), m/z 217 (carbons 3–5 of ribose), and m/z
242 (carbons 1–4 of ribose; electron impact ionization) to determine molar enrichment and the positional distribution of
13
C in ribose. Ribose molecules labeled with a single 13C atom
on the first carbon position (m1) recovered from RNA were
used to gauge the ribose fraction produced by direct oxidation of glucose or fructose through the glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) pathway. Ribose molecules labeled
with 13C on the first two carbon positions (m2) were used
to measure the fraction produced by TK. Doubly labeled ribose molecules (m2 and m4) on the fourth and fifth carbon
positions were used to measure molar fraction produced by
triose phosphate isomerase and TK.
TK expression
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used
to measure TKT, TKTL1, and TKTL2 mRNA levels. Briefly,
RNA was extracted from pancreatic cancer cells (CaPan-I,
CaPan-II, HPAF2, Aspc1, Panc-1, and MiaPaCa-2) using
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed

with oligo(dT) primers at 50°C for 50 minutes using the
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen).
Real-time PCR was carried out using the SYBR Green qPCR
master mix (SABiosciences) in a Bio-Rad MyiQ Single-Color
Real-Time PCR Detection System. The primers used for each
amplified sequence were designed and purchased from
OriGene Technologies, Inc. The cycling parameters for PCR
amplification were as follows: activation for 10 minutes at
95°C, then denaturation for 15 seconds at 95°C, and annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 minute (40 cycles). Triplicate CT
values were analyzed with Microsoft Excel using the comparative CT (ΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer
(SABiosciences). The amount of amplified sequence (2−ΔΔCT)
was obtained by normalizing to an endogenous reference
(18S rRNA) relative to a calibrator (one experimental sample).
For immunoblotting, protein from total cell lysates was
extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and resolved by the SDS-PAGE by standard methods using antibodies to TK (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and β-actin
(1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
TK and uricase activity
Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells were incubated as before
in glucose or fructose for 24 to 120 hours, following which
we used an ELISA-based fluorimetric assay (Amplex Red
Uric Acid/Uricase Assay kit, Invitrogen) to measure uricase
activity in conditioned medium derived from the pancreatic
cancer cells. Uricase activity correlates highly with uric
acid production, a purine by-product of nucleic acid synthesis. Briefly, in the assay, uricase catalyzes the conversion
of uric acid to allantoin, hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), and
carbon dioxide. The H2O2 then, in the presence of horseradish peroxidase, reacts stoichiometrically with Amplex
Red reagent to generate the red fluorescent oxidation product resorufin, which is measured using excitation at
530 nm and detection at 590 nm. The assay can detect levels
as low as 100 nmol/L uric acid. To measure TKT activity,
we used a validated method that calculates TKT enzyme
activity based on the catalysis of the oxidation of NADH.
Briefly, following treatment with glucose or fructose as
before, pancreatic cancer cells were lysed in Tris-based
protein lysis buffer, sonicated, and spun, and supernatants
were collected. One hundred microliters of the latter
supernatant fractions were added to a mixture containing
15 mmol/L ribose 5-phosphate, 50 μmol/L NADH,
0.1 mmol/L Tris-HCl, and 200 units/mL glycerol-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase. After gentle mixing, the absorbance of the
mixture was measured at 10-minute intervals for 2 hours
at 340 nm. TK activity was then derived from the difference
in absorbance at 10 and 80 minutes and expressed as nmol/
min/million cells.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM except for Fig. 2, where
mean ± SD and 25% to 75% interquartile ranges are depicted.
Student's t test (two-tailed) was used to compare two groups,
and ANOVA was used for larger group comparisons (P < 0.05
was considered significant).

Results
Pancreatic cancer cell proliferative rates are similar
in fructose and glucose
Typically, pancreatic cancer cells are maintained in highglucose DMEM that contains ∼18 mmol/L glucose, which
exceeds normal physiologic (5 mmol/L) or even diabetic
(11 mmol/L) glycemic conditions. Little is known about
circulating serum fructose levels, and reported concentrations have varied depending on the assay methodology
used (16–18). To determine the potential significance of
the circulating fructose concentrations we have recently
reported in pancreatic cancer patients (14), we measured
in vitro proliferation rates of several pancreatic cancer cell
lines, including Panc-1, MiaPaCa-2, CaPan-I, CaPan-II, and
HPAF1, in a range of fructose and glucose concentrations
(5–5,500 μmol/L) and compared these to cells cultured in
10% FBS alone (which contains 0.4 mmol/L glucose) and
standard high-glucose DMEM (normal medium, 18 mmol/L
glucose). We also compared glucose- and fructose-induced
proliferative rates in immortalized normal pancreatic ductal
cells (HPDE6). As expected, the pancreatic cancer cells grew
in 55 to 5,500 μmol/L glucose (Fig. 1A–D). However, as
depicted, the pancreatic cancer cells also grew readily in
55 to 5,500 μmol/L fructose (Fig. 1A–D), concentrations that
we and others have shown in the human circulation, and
proliferative rates were similar in fructose- or glucose-treated
cells. The immortalized “normal” pancreatic ductal (HPDE6)
cells also grew in both glucose and fructose (Fig. 1E).
As we were examining carbohydrate-mediated effects, we
considered that the change we had observed in proliferative
rates, as measured by the CTG assay, simply reflected changes
in mitochondrial oxidation. Therefore, we used two additional methods to examine proliferative rates following fructose treatment. We also compared BrdUrd uptake in the
pancreatic cancer cells following treatment with a range of
glucose and fructose concentrations and in a range of FBS
concentrations (1%, 5%, and 10%). In agreement with the
CTG and FACS studies, similar BrdUrd uptake was observed
in glucose-treated in comparison with fructose-treated pancreatic cancer cells (MiaPaCa-2 depicted in Fig. 1F), and
the proliferation seemed unaffected by altered FBS levels,
showing that fructose serves as an alternate substrate for
pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. FACS showed a similar
percentage of cells in S phase in Panc-1 pancreatic cancer
cells cultured in 5.5 mmol/L glucose in comparison with
cells cultured in 5.5 mmol/L fructose, in keeping with equivalent proliferative rates in the two sugars (Fig. 1G; Panc-1:
5.5 mmol/L glucose, 38%; 5.5 mmol/L fructose, 41%; P <
0.01). In conjunction with increased S-phase population, a
concordant reduction in cells in the resting G0-G1 (Panc-1:
5.5 mmol/L glucose, 26%; 5.5 mmol/L fructose, 23%; P <
0.05) was noted, supporting the CTG proliferation assay findings and indicating that the pancreatic cancer cells exhibited
similar proliferative rates when cultured in equivalent fructose and glucose concentrations.
We also examined proliferative rates in glucose- or fructosetreated primary cultures of freshly resected pancreatic cancers

Fructose Induces Pancreatic Cancer Growth

for 48 h measured using a CTG assay. Selected pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2) were also plated in 5.5 mmol/L glucose or 5.5 mmol/L
fructose for 48 to 72 h, cells were fixed in methanol, and nuclei were stained with propidium iodide for FACS analyses (F), or BrdUrd (10 μmol/L) was
added in the final 12 h of incubation in the sugars, following which BrdUrd uptake was quantified (G). H, mechanically and enzymatically dispersed freshly
resected pancreatic cancers were plated in glucose or fructose for 48 h, after which proliferative rates were measured by CTG assay. Proliferative
rates (expressed as the percentage difference between the sugars) were measured using a CTG assay. P = not significant, fructose versus glucose or
normal medium (NM).

(n = 5). As depicted in a representative cancer (Fig. 1H), proliferation rates were similar in the pancreatic cancer cells treated
with either glucose or fructose. These results confirm that although glucose is the preferred substrate for cancer cell proliferation, pancreatic cancer cells can also uptake and use
fructose for growth.
Cancer cells metabolize fructose and glucose
differently
To gain further insight into mechanism(s) by which cancer
cells might use fructose versus glucose, leading to cell proliferation, we examined the metabolic profiles of the two
sugars in the cancer cells. To do this, we incubated the cells
in 5 mmol/L [U-13C6]D-glucose or [U-13C6]D-fructose (half
unlabeled glucose or fructose, half labeled with the 13 C
tracer) and analyzed medium and cell pellets by mass spectroscopy to map the metabolic pathways of the two sugars
(19, 20). The results derived from the Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells are presented, and as expected, a large proportion
of the 13C-labeled glucose administered to the pancreatic

www.aacrjournals.org

cancer cells entered glycolysis and was metabolized to
generate lactate (Fig. 2A) and CO2 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a
comparatively small fraction of 13C-labeled fructose was
metabolized to generate lactate and CO2, resulting in 800%
lower lactate and 350% lower CO2 production for fructose
in comparison with glucose. Likewise, a significant proportion of glucose metabolism contributed to fatty acid synthesis as evidenced by glucose-derived 13C-labeled behenic acid
(Fig. 2C, light bar) and palmitate (Fig. 2D, light bar), but 150%
lower levels of behenic acid (Fig. 2C, dark bar) and palmitate
levels (Fig. 2D, dark bar) were derived from 13C-labeled fructose (similar results were seen for all C16 to C26 fatty acids).
Fructose is preferentially used for nucleic
acid synthesis
The pentose phosphate shunt comprises an oxidative
branch regulated by the enzyme G6PDH and a nonoxidative
branch regulated by TKT (21). Metabolomic studies showed
that both sugars were similarly used via the G6PDH-regulated
oxidative pathway of the PPP (Fig. 2E). However, in contrast

to the relatively low contribution of fructose to glycolysis
and fatty acid synthesis in comparison with glucose, metabolomic studies showed that 13C-labeled fructose was preferentially metabolized at 250% higher rates than glucose via the
TK-regulated, nonoxidative pathway of the PPP to synthesize
nucleic acids (Fig. 2F). In support of the effects observed
in pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells, addition of fructose
(5 mmol/L) to other solid cancers including pancreatic cancer
MiaPaCa, hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells, and immortalized
normal pancreatic ductal cells (HPDE6) incubated in glucose
(5.5 mmol/L) resulted in increased ribose synthesis via
the TK-regulated nonoxidative pathway (Fig. 2G). We also
carried out metabolomic studies in freshly resected pancreatic carcinoma cultures using the [U- 13 C 6 ] D -glucose or
[U-13C6]D-fructose tracers. Results derived from the freshly
resected cancers concurred with the findings in the pancreatic cancer cell lines and showed that glucose was oxidized
in pancreatic cancers at 460% higher rates in comparison
with fructose (Fig. 2H). However, in normal pancreas tissues,
oxidative use of glucose and fructose to generate CO2 was

similar (Fig. 2I), suggesting that differential use of fructose
versus glucose is restricted to transformed pancreatic cells.
Fructose induces TK-dependent purine synthesis
The enzyme TKT drives nucleic acid synthesis by generation of xylulose-5-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate and
glycerol (21). Recent studies have shown increased TKT gene
expression in several cancers, and TKT levels correlate with
reduced survival rates (3, 4). As depicted (Fig. 3A and B), all
the pancreatic cancer cell lines tested expressed TKT,
TKTL1, and TKTL2, although TKT mRNA (Fig. 3A) levels
were significantly (∼300- to 800-fold) higher than TKTL1
and TKTL2 (Fig. 3B). Additionally, as depicted in Fig. 3A,
a trend toward higher baseline TKT mRNA levels was seen
in moderately and well-differentiated pancreatic cancer cell
lines, although low-level TKT was also seen in normal pancreatic ductal HPDE6 cells. To explore the potential mechanism by which fructose might be preferentially used in the
nonoxidative pathway in comparison with glucose, we then
asked if fructose treatment could modify TKT expression

and/or action. Following Panc-1 cell fructose treatment, TKT
protein expression increased 200 ± 3% in comparison with
glucose-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, in addition to
increased TKT levels, TKT activity increased 280 ± 5% following fructose treatment (Fig. 3D) in comparison with TKT
activity in the glucose-treated Panc-1 cells. The enzyme
TKT requires thiamine-derived mitochondrial NAD+ as a
cofactor, and NAD synthesis can be disrupted with the thiamine analogue oxythiamine. In keeping with our finding that
fructose-induced pancreatic cancer proliferation involved
TKT, oxythiamine treatment abolished the fructose-induced
increased pancreatic cancer cell proliferation rates (Fig. 4A).
We reasoned that if fructose was preferentially used for
nucleic acid synthesis, that levels of uric acid, the purine
synthesis waste by-product, might also alter following fructose treatment. Consistent with the metabolomic studies
that showed increased fructose-derived nucleic acid synthesis, uricase activity in conditioned medium harvested at
96 and 120 hours from the fructose-treated Panc-1 cells
was ∼120% and ∼150% higher than levels measured in conditioned medium derived from the glucose-treated Panc-1
cells at the same time points (P < 0.01; Fig. 4B). These results
showed increased pancreatic cancer cell uric acid production
after fructose treatment, and as uric acid is a by-product
of purine metabolism, this observation further supported
our metabolomic studies that showed that fructose was
metabolized to a greater extent than glucose to generate
nucleic acids.

Discussion
Conventionally, fructose and glucose have been considered
as interchangeable monosaccharides that are both metabolized equivalently in aerobic glycolysis and in the TCA cycle,
contributing equally to fatty acid and nucleic acid synthesis
as required by cell demands (22, 23). However, our data
show that metabolism of fructose and glucose by cancer cells
is importantly different in ways that do not simply involve
fructose-glucose isomerization. Indeed, our data indicate
that the contribution of fructose to nucleic acid synthesis
is considerably greater than glucose and that cancer cells
preferentially use fructose via TKT-mediated metabolism to
synthesize additional nucleic acids to facilitate increased
proliferative capacity. Synthesis of nucleic acids and nucleotides is of utmost importance for proliferating tissues and
especially cancers. Central reactions of this process include
ribose 5-phosphate formation through phosphoribosyl PPi,
and prior studies in pancreatic cancer cells have shown that
pentose cycle reactions contribute to >85% of de novo ribose
synthesis in RNA with the majority derived from the nonoxidative (TKT-regulated) pathway (21). This is the first report of TKT gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells and
shows expression of TKT, TKTL1, and TKTL2 in all the pancreatic cancer cell lines tested. TKT mRNA levels were significantly higher in all pancreatic cancer cell lines, and a trend
toward higher baseline TKT mRNA levels was seen in moderately and well-differentiated pancreatic cancer cell lines.

Figure 4. Inhibition of fructose-induced pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cell proliferation by (A) incubation with the TK inhibitor oxythiamine (0.5–2 mmol/L) for
72 h. Proliferative rates were measured using the MTS proliferation assay. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. B, uric acid production was measured after glucose
or fructose treatment by uricase-mediated catalytic conversion of uric acid to allantoin, carbon dioxide, and H2O2, which in the presence of horseradish
peroxidase reacts stoichiometrically with Amplex Red reagent to generate the red fluorescent oxidation product resorufin.

However, low-level TKT was also seen in normal pancreatic
ductal HPDE6 cells, and therefore, the significance of this
heterogeneous TKT mRNA expression is uncertain. Studies
in other tumor types, including cervical, colorectal, thyroid,
glioma, and renal cancers, showed that tumor TKTL1 mRNA
was overexpressed in comparison with normal tissues, and
TKTL1 mRNA levels correlated with reduced survival rates
(4). Furthermore, experimental suppression of TKTL1 action
by small interfering RNA (siRNA), short hairpin RNA
(shRNA), or specific TK inhibitors reduced cancer cell proliferation, and activation of TK by thiamine addition stimulated tumor growth (2, 3). Our results are similar in that
higher TKTL1 levels were seen in pancreatic cancers than

in normal pancreatic ductal cells. However, our results clearly illustrate that TKT is the predominantly expressed gene
encoding TK in pancreatic cancer and normal pancreatic
ductal cells. Suppression of TK action by siRNA or shRNA
or by pharmacologic inhibition results in reduced cancer cell
proliferative rates due to reduced glucose consumption, lower lactate production, and ultimately impaired supply of ATP
for cancer cell growth. In this study, we show that fructose
potently induces TKT expression and activity to aid metabolism of fructose in the PPP. Although the PPP is inefficient at
ATP generation, it functions to provide C5 sugars (pentoses)
from C6 sugars (hexoses), simultaneously generating NADPH
redox equivalents. These pentoses are urgently needed for

Fructose Induces Pancreatic Cancer Growth

DNA and RNA synthesis and allow access to NADPH redox
equivalents, which may be essential to counter endogeneous
(from dysfunctional mitochondria) and exogenous (from immune cells) reactive oxygen species that are increased in
cancers. The role of fructose to generate nucleic acids is supported by our demonstration of increased production of uric
acid, as a by-product of purine metabolism, and provides important mechanistic insight into a recent report of increased
serum uric acid levels in patients with high-fructose consumption (24). Thus, we propose an alternative model for
glucose (Fig. 5A) and fructose (Fig. 5B) metabolism in cancer
cells, where fructose is preferentially used to generate nucleic
acids in comparison with its contribution to glycolysis and
fatty acid synthesis. In addition to our in vitro findings in cancer cells, previous studies have shown that chronic fructose
feeding in animals leads to insulin resistance and promotes
in vivo growth, as evidenced by increased organ weights (25,
26). Additionally, in humans, increased fructose consumption
has been linked to obesity, diabetes, and elevated uric acid
levels, the latter in keeping with our in vitro metabolomic
studies showing increased fructose-directed nucleic acid synthesis (26, 27). We have recently shown 2.5-fold higher serum
fructose levels in pancreatic cancer patients compared with
healthy subjects (14). Furthermore, in healthy volunteers, serum fructose level rose rapidly following ingestion of a liquid
fructose and glucose load, and in contrast to glucose that
quickly returned to fasting levels, serum fructose remained
elevated for >2 hours, suggesting that circulating human
fructose levels are unregulated in comparison with the exquisite regulation of blood glucose (14).
In summary, fructose, either in the hepatic portal or systemic human circulation, provides cancer cells a plentiful direct
source of donor keto-groups for the pentose-synthesizing TK
enzyme (2, 13). Our results are extremely important for pancreatic cancer growth for two reasons (28). First, they show
that fructose itself is preferentially used via the nonoxidative
PPP to provide five-carbon pentose for RNA synthesis. Second,

fructose induces TK expression, an activity that enables
more rapid use of both glucose and fructose in the nonoxidative PPP. We established this using the highest precision
scoring metabolic tracer [1,2-13C2]D-glucose as recently reported from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (29).
Together, these fructose-mediated actions enable pancreatic
cancers to more rapidly generate increased nucleic acids
and proliferate more efficiently. The findings should also
heighten awareness about the independent contribution of
other sugars, in this case fructose, to cancer metabolism and
the cancer phenotype.
Therefore, fructose is a particularly significant dietary sugar component with important implications for patients with
cancer, particularly given the significant dietary change that
has occurred in human fructose consumption since the mid20th century. Our findings provide important insights into
recent epidemiologic studies that have identified refined
fructose as an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer,
and identify fructose-mediated actions as a novel therapeutic
cancer target.
