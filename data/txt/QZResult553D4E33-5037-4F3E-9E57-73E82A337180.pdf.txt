Abstract
The EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase is frequently overexpressed and functionally altered in malignant cells and thus
provides opportunities for selective targeting of tumor cells.
We describe here the development of a novel, bispecific singlechain antibody (bscAb) referred to as bscEphA2xCD3. This
molecule simultaneously targets EphA2 on tumor cells and
the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex on T cells and possesses
structural and functional characteristics of the recently
developed BiTE technology. An EphA2-specific single-chain
antibody was selected for recognition of an epitope that is
preferentially exposed on malignant cells based on the
concept of epitope exclusion; this was fused to a CD3-specific
single-chain antibody to generate bscEphA2xCD3. The resultant bscAb redirected unstimulated human T cells to lyse
EphA2-expressing tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo.
In separate experiments, efficient tumor cell lysis was
achieved in vitro at drug concentrations V1 Mg/mL, at a
low T-cell effector-to-tumor target cell ratio (1:1), and with
tumor cells that possess few available binding sites (2,400 per
cell) for bscEphA2xCD3. Time-lapsed microscopy revealed
potent cytotoxic activity of bscEphA2xCD3-activated T cells
against monolayers of malignant cells but not against
monolayers of nontransformed EphA2-positive cells except
at the edges of the monolayer where the target epitope was
exposed. BscEphA2xCD3 was also efficacious in human
xenograft mouse models modified to show human T-cell
killing of tumors. Together, our results reveal opportunities
for redirecting the potent activity of cytotoxic T cells towards
tumor cells that express selectively accessible epitopes and
establish EphA2-specific bscAb molecules as novel and potent
therapeutics with selectivity for tumor cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase is selectively overexpressed
on many different cancers, and high levels of EphA2 have been
observed on tumors of multiple lineages, including metastatic
melanomas and on carcinomas of the breast, cervix, colon,
esophagus, lung, ovary, prostate, and kidney (1). Retrospective

analyses indicate that the highest levels of EphA2 expression are
consistently found on the most aggressive cancers, and that EphA2
overexpression conveys an independent prognostic value for
metastasis and patient survival (2–9). Consistent with this, ectopic
overexpression of EphA2 is sufficient to confer tumorigenic and
metastatic potential upon nontransformed epithelial cells (10).
EphA2 binds ligands, known as ephrins, which are anchored to
the membrane of neighboring cells (11). Benign epithelial cells
normally form stable linkages with adjacent cells, and the low
levels of EphA2 that are present on benign epithelial cells are
enriched within intercellular junctions (12). This localization
favors stable ligand binding, and indeed, EphA2 on benign cells
is autophosphorylated (12, 13). Malignant cells generally show
unstable cell-cell contacts (14–16), and a consequence of this
change is that the high levels of EphA2 on malignant cells fail to
bind ligand and thus become diffusely distributed over the cell
surface (12). Thus, EphA2 function is altered on malignant cells
(17). Our earlier studies suggested that differential ligand binding
might provide opportunities to identify specific residues that are
uniquely exposed on malignant cells, and a subset of EphA2specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were subsequently identified
as binding selectively to epitopes on malignant cells (18).
mAbs have provided important new breakthroughs for cancer
treatment. The high specificity of antibodies can enhance the
targeting of diseased cells while minimizing the unwanted adverse
effects on normal tissues. Receptor tyrosine kinases, including
epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2, have been validated as
particularly good targets for antibody-based therapy (19). Although
mAbs have proven to be highly effective, there remain opportunities for further improvements (20). For example, relatively large
amounts (mg/kg) of antibodies are generally necessary for therapy
(21–23). Moreover, individuals who have certain polymorphisms in
their Fcg receptors seem to be less responsive to antibody-based
therapies (24–26). In light of such potential limitations, we have
sought to expand upon the principles validated by mAbs. To this
end, we report herein the development and utilization of EphA2/
CD3 bispecific single-chain antibodies (bscAb).
BscAbs of the BiTE class consist of two flexibly linked singlechain antibody fragments (scFv) that have the potential to redirect
tumor resident and circulating T cells to lyse tumor cells (27). One
scFv interacts with epitopes on tumor cells, whereas the other scFv
binds an epitope on the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex of
T cells. This dual specificity seeds the formation of transient lytic
synapses between T lymphocytes and malignant cells, which causes
subsequent lysis of the malignant cells (28). Thus, BiTE molecules
can redirect both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to kill tumor cells in a
serial fashion that is independent of the TCR-defined specificity
and expression of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) on malignant
cells (28–30). The concepts underlying the BiTE technology have

been successfully validated in preclinical studies with two different
target antigens: CD19 (29–33) and EpCAM (34–37). A CD19/CD3directed bscAb (referred to as MEDI-538, MT103, or bscCD19xCD3)
is currently being investigated in the clinic as a potential therapy
for B-cell malignancies. Herein, we report the construction of an
EphA2-specific bscAb that was designed to target epitopes that are
uniquely exposed on malignant cells. We also show the specificity
and potent efficacy to redirect T-cell lysis of the EphA2-specific
bscAb in both cell culture and animal models and provide evidence
that the epitope exclusion properties of the anti-EphA2 scFv are
retained in the context of the EphA2-specific bscAb.

Materials and Methods
Selection, expression, and purification of bscEphA2xCD3. EphA2specific bscAb molecules were constructed from the VH and VL domains that
were cloned from the mouse hybridoma EA2 (18) into the expression vector
pEF-DHFR using the methods described previously (29). EA2 binds to a
unique human EphA2 epitope that is selectively available on malignant cells
but not accessible on normal cells; the mAb blocks tumor growth in vivo (18).
EphA2-specific bscAb molecules of the BiTE class consist of a CD3qspecific single-chain antibody derived from a ‘‘deimmunized’’ version of the
mouse mAb L2K (30). The deimmunization process altered L2K amino
acids using a procedure to maintain specificity of antibody binding and
reduce the number of human T helper cell epitopes by elimination of MHC
class II anchor amino acids within potential immunoreactive epitopes (38).
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO dhfr; American Type Culture Collection,
McLean, VA) cells were transfected with the expression vectors encoding
EA2-based bscAb constructs that contained a COOH terminus hexahistidine
tag, and stable cell lines were selected (29). CHO cell supernatants that
contained secreted protein were clarified by centrifugation and enriched
for bscAb molecules by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as
described (36) and purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex
S200 HiPrep column (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in PBS.
Coomassie blue (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)–stained SDS-PAGE and detection by Western blot confirmed the size, identity, and purity (>95%) of the
isolated protein. Protein concentrations were estimated using a MicroBCA
assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) calibrated with an IgG (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
protein standard.
Cell lines and culture. CHO dhfr and the human cell lines SW480
(colorectal adenocarcinoma), A375 (melanoma), PC3 (prostate adenocarcinoma), A549 (non–small cell lung alveolar adenocarcinoma), MDA-MB-231
(breast adenocarcinoma), MCF10A (breast epithelial), MDA-MB-468 (breast
adenocarcinoma), and SK-MEL-28 (malignant melanoma) cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in the
recommended media. M14 (melanoma) was acquired from the National
Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis cell line
repository and cultured using the recommended media and conditions.
The HeyA8 (ovarian carcinoma) cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Anil Sood,
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (39).
Immunohistochemical microscopy. Frozen human tissue sections
were stained as described (40) with the human EphA2-reactive mAb, EA2, to
determine if the antibody specifically binds to normal tissue. Tissue sections
were dehydrated, coverslipped, and imaged.
Surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis. All studies were done
using a Sensor Chip CM5 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) that contains a
carboxymethyl dextran matrix and a Biacore3000 surface plasmon
resonance biosensor (Biacore). Soluble CD3qg was covalently attached
to the carboxymethyl dextran matrix using amine-coupling chemistry. A
reference surface was created by omission of the CD3qg coupling step.
EphA2-Fc was captured via a high-affinity interaction between the Fc
portion of EphA2-Fc and a goat anti-human IgG (Fc) (KPL, Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD). Goat anti-human IgG (Fc) was covalently attached to
the carboxymethyl dextran matrix using amine-coupling chemistry. Two
anti-human IgG (Fc)–specific surfaces were created. One of these surfaces
was used as a reference surface, whereas the other surface was used to

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

create an EphA2-Fc–specific surface. Different concentrations of bscEphA2xCD3 were prepared by serial dilution in HBS-EP [0.01 mol/L HEPES
(pH 7.4), 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 3 mmol/L EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20].
BscEphA2xCD3 was injected in a serial-flow manner across the CD3qgspecific or EphA2-specific surface and its corresponding reference surface.
Dissociation of bound bscEphA2xCD3 was monitored in the presence of
HBS-EP. Remaining bound material was removed with 10 mmol/L disodium
tetraborate (pH 8.5), 1 mol/L NaCl ( for CD3qg-specific surface), or 10
mmol/L glycine (pH 1.7; for EphA2-Fc–specific surface).
Cell surface antigen density. The number of EphA2 surface binding
sites on HeyA8, SW480, and A549 human carcinoma lines and M14 and
A375 melanoma lines was estimated using Qifikit (DakoCytomation,
Carpinteria, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions using the anti-human
EphA2 antibody B233 (18). The number of surface bindings sites was
estimated by nonlinear regression analysis from the bead calibration curve.
Trypsin cleaves 10% to 20% of EphA2 from the surface of cells compared
with using EDTA to remove adherent cells from tissue culture flasks (data
not shown). Surface levels of EphA2 on trypsinized cells were equivalent
if measured immediately after treatment with trypsin or after a
42-h incubation period at 37jC in non–tissue culture–treated 96-well plates.
Cytotoxicity assays. BscAb-mediated cytotoxicity was measured using
either a standard chromium release assay or a flow cytometry–based assay.
The chromium release assay and calculations were conducted as described
(29). Flow cytometry–based redirected cellular cytotoxicity assays were
carried out as described (30) except using CD3+ T cells enriched from
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as effector cells and
various EphA2-positive human carcinoma cell lines, melanoma cell lines, or
transfected CHO cells as a source of target cells. Target cells were labeled
with 3,3¶-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine [DiOC18(3) or ‘‘DiO’’; Invitrogen] green
fluorescent membrane dye to distinguish them from PBMCs by flow
cytometry after addition of propidium iodide. EC50 values (estimated bscAb
concentration at which half-maximal lysis of target cells occurred) were
calculated using a four-variable nonlinear fit model.
Time-lapsed microscopy. Transformed A549 or MDA-MB-231 cells, or
nontransformed MCF10A cells were seeded into a tissue culture–treated
48-well plate (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 24 h to establish an adherent
cell monolayer. Directly before recording images, some monolayers were
disrupted by scraping the wells with a pipette tip. Each well received
effector cells in 400 AL of medium alone or mixed with bscAb molecules to a
final concentration of 100 ng/mL. Stimulated human CD8+ T cells were used
as the effector cells and added to an effector-to-target (E/T) ratio of 1:1
(intact monolayer panels) or 1:3 (disrupted Monolayer panels) with a
negative control bscAb, positive control bscAb specific for a pancarcinoma
antigen (EpCAM), or bscEphA2xCD3, in media containing 20 mmol/L
HEPES to stabilize pH. Each plate was sealed with a transparent film
(Fasson S695) to prevent evaporation and placed into a 37jC climate
chamber on the stage of a Nikon microscope with an attached digital
camera. Transmission light micrographs were recorded for a duration of
20 h (f1 picture per minute) and converted to an AVI video movie.
The stimulated human CD8+ T cells were produced as described (33)
from human PBMC that was isolated from healthy donors.
SW480 human colon carcinoma xenograft model. Two strains of mice
permissive for human xenograft studies were used: nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice (The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) that are characterized by their T-cell, B-cell,
and natural killer (NK) cell deficiencies and lack of macrophage function
(41) and SCID mice characterized by their T- and B-cell deficiencies (42).
SCID mice received a weekly i.p. administration of a polyclonal rabbit antiasialo GM1 antibody (Wako, Richmond, VA) starting the day before the
study began to eliminate mouse NK cells (43). Animal studies were done at
two locations: at MedImmune in an Association for Animal and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited and U.S. Department
of Agriculture–licensed facility and at Experimental Pharmacology and
Toxicology in Berlin-Buch, Germany according to the German Animal
Protection Law with permission from the responsible local authorities.
In vivo efficacy of bscEphA2xCD3 was evaluated a xenograft mouse
model that consisted of NOD/SCID mice that received a s.c. engraftment of

SW480 cells and unstimulated human CD3-positive T cells that has been
previously described (34, 35). Tumor growth was measured at the indicated
days with calipers in two perpendicular dimensions: tumor volume (cm3)
was calculated using the formula (width2  length) / 2 and reported as the
arithmetic mean for each group and was used as a surrogate marker for
treatment efficacy. Error bars in each graph represent the SE for the
reported tumor volumes. The results are presented from one experiment
and are representative of two separate studies.
At various time intervals after i.v. engraftment, mouse spleens were
evaluated for the presence of viable human CD3+ T cells. Briefly, anti-asialo
GM1 antibody–treated SCID mice were administered 107 human CD3+ T
cells by i.v. injection; the spleens of designated mice were collected, stained
with APC-conjugated anti-human CD3 and propidium iodide, and analyzed
by flow cytometry.

Results
Generation of a bscAb with selectivity for EphA2+ tumors.
For bscAb construction, the anti-human EphA2 mAb EA2 was
selected based on its ability to bind an epitope on EphA2 that is
accessible on transformed cells and not on nontransformed cells
(18). In light of the shown potency of other bscAb molecules of the
BiTE class, we rationalized that epitope exclusion, in combination
with EphA2 overexpression on tumor cells, should minimize
potential binding and toxicity to benign tissues. To test for
selective binding to tumors, the binding of EA2 to a panel of
normal human tissues and cell lines was assessed by immunohistochemical analyses (Fig. 1). EA2 did not stain any of the 15 normal
frozen human tissue sections, including tissues obtained from
normal human heart, liver, lung, or spleen as shown in Fig. 1B. As
controls, we verified that EA2 retained the ability to stain human

EphA2-expressing PC3 prostate tumor cells, but not EphA2negative breast adenocarcinoma–negative cells (Fig. 1A). An
isotype-matched mAb (1A7) provided a negative control (data
not shown). Surface plasmon resonance determined that the
equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) of the EA2 mAb for EphA2
was f6 nmol/L.
A deimmunized derivative of the human CD3q-specific murine
mAb L2K called diL2K (30) provided the effector scFv for the
EphA2-specific bscAb molecules. This antibody had deimmunized
variable domains, which minimized a potential inactivation
of resulting bscAb molecules by a neutralizing antibody response
of the host. K D of mAb diL2K for CD3qg was f87 nmol/L as
determined by surface plasmon resonance.
BscEphA2xCD3, the resultant bscAb constructed from EA2 and
diL2K scFvs, redirected T cells to lyse MDA-MB-231 cells at a halfmaximal concentration (EC50) of 6 to 8 ng/mL. As additional
evaluation criteria, stability in human sera, expression levels in cell
culture supernatant, and binding affinities of the different bscAb
molecules were analyzed. BscEphA2xCD3 was found to have stable
biological activity in human plasma (100% active after 24 h as
determined by an 18-h cytotoxicity assay and compared with
untreated material), was produced at high yields, and showed an
imbalance in affinities for EphA2 and CD3. BscEphA2xCD3 bound
EphA2 with an apparent affinity of K D equal to 113 nmol/L,
whereas CD3qg was bound with an estimated K D of 400 nmol/L.
Potent redirected lysis of EphA2-expressing cell lines by
bscEphA2xCD3-activated T cells. The biological activity of
bscEphA2xCD3 was measured by an ex vivo cytotoxic assay in
which SW480 human colon carcinoma cells provided targets for

human tissue sections of heart, liver, lung, and spleen.

human peripheral CD3+ T cells. In the presence of bscEphA2xCD3,
previously unstimulated T cells were redirected to lyse SW480
tumor cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A–C), but
as shown with SK-MEL-28 cells, bscEphA2xCD3 did not initiate
redirected lysis of EphA2-deficient cells by T cells (Fig. 2A). We also
examined the need for TCR/CD3 engagement by adding excess
amounts of anti-CD3 IgG (DiL2K) to the cytotoxicity assay.
The resulting decrease in potency confirmed the need of
bscEphA2xCD3 to engage CD3 to stimulate T-cell lysis of target
cells (Fig. 2B). Likewise, additional excess EphA2 antibody (EA2)
decreased bscEphA2xCD3-mediated killing of target cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2C), and showed that T cell–mediated
tumor cell lysis by bscEphA2xCD3 was dependent on the
recognition of the EphA2 target. Finally, incubation of T cells and
SW480 tumor cells in the presence of a bscAb that recognizes
CD19, which is not expressed by SW480 tumor cells, did not
promote killing of the SW480 cells despite having a CD3-binding
arm similar to that of bscEphA2xCD3 (Fig. 2A).
To explore the kinetics and potency of bscEphA2xCD3, several
variables of redirected tumor cell lysis were evaluated. An analysis
of the time course of target cell killing revealed that in the presence
of bscEphA2xCD3, there was limited lysis by unstimulated CD3+ T
cells after 18 h, and that maximal killing (>80% lysis) occurred by
42 h (Fig. 3A). In most experiments, the magnitude of redirected
T-cell lysis exceeded 80% of target cells. As an additional measure
of potency, E/T cell ratio was investigated. E/T ratios of 1:1 to 20:1
gave similarly high lytic activity, whereas E/T ratios of 1:2 and 1:5
still led to redirected lysis of SW480 tumor cells albeit at a reduced
percentage (Fig. 3B). Notably, the estimated EC50 values remained
largely constant despite variations in incubation time (Fig. 3A; 1–9
ng/mL) or E/T ratio (Fig. 3B; 2–7 ng/mL).
Finally, tumor cell targets, which expressed different levels of
EphA2 on the surface, were evaluated to determine whether there
was a threshold of surface target density required for the activity of
bscEphA2xCD3. Efficient redirected T-cell lysis was observed for all
EphA2-expressing cell lines (Fig. 3C), including M14 cells, which
expressed as few as 2,400 molecules of EphA2 per cell (Fig. 3D). The
magnitude of lysis mediated by bscEphA2xCD3 was similar for
target cells irrespective of their surface target density (Fig. 3D).
However, the surface density of EphA2 on target cells did have an
effect on the efficiency of redirected lysis. We observed a trend in
which the potency of bscEphA2xCD3 increased as the number of
EphA2 binding sites on the tumor cells increased (Fig. 3C).
Together, these findings suggested that bscEphA2xCD3 can
potently and specifically redirect unstimulated human T cells to
lyse EphA2-expressing tumor cells, even when there are low levels
of available binding sites on the tumor.
bscEphA2xCD3 selectively lyses malignant cells and spares
nontransformed epithelial cells when the EphA2 epitope is
occluded at cell-cell junctions. The EphA2-specific mAb EA2,
from which bscEphA2xCD3 was derived, showed selective binding
to tumor cells (i.e., epitope exclusion; ref. 18). Here, we investigated
whether bscEphA2xCD3-mediated cytotoxic T-cell activity could
differentiate between transformed (lacks contact inhibition; EphA2
expression over the entire surface of the cell) and nontransformed
(maintains contact inhibition; EphA2 expression primarily within
tight junctions) cells and thus determine if the epitope exclusion
characteristic of EA2 mAb had been conserved in the generation of
bscEphA2xCD3. A time-lapsed video microscopy study was undertaken to compare the reactivity of T cells in the presence of
bscEphA2xCD3 against EphA2-positive, nontransformed epithelial

cells (MCF10A) and against EphA2-positive malignant A549 or
MDA-MB-231 cells. As expected from the cell lysis assays presented
in Figs. 2 and 3, bscEphA2xCD3-activated T cells lysed A549 and
MDA-MB-231 tumor cells all across the tumor cell monolayers that
lead to clusters of highly activated T cells at sites where the
monolayer was cleared (Fig. 4D). Cell lysis was further confirmed
by positive immunofluorescence staining with propidium iodide
only at the sites of T-cell attack (data not shown). Disruption of the
monolayer did not alter the distribution or pattern of cytotoxic
activity of T cells across the monolayer (Fig. 4A–D, disrupted
monolayers). The specificity of tumor cell killing seen by timelapsed microscopy was confirmed by the use of a control bscAb
that did not bind to EphA2-positive cells (Fig. 4A) and in the
absence of either bscEphA2xCD3 or of T cells (data not shown).
Analogous experiments were then done with bscEphA2xCD3 and
the nontransformed epithelial cell line MCF10A, which expresses

levels of cell surface EphA2 receptors that are similar to MDA-MB231 cells (18). Subconfluent monolayers of MCF10A cells were used
since the concept of epitope exclusion predicts that unobstructed
EphA2 epitopes on the exposed (outer) edge of the monolayer
should be available to bind bscEphA2xCD3, whereas cells in
contact with each other should not. Cytotoxic T-cell activity against
the MCF10A monolayer was only noted at the exposed edge of the
monolayer; central parts of the MCF10A monolayer were largely
unaffected by T cells except where stable linkages with adjacent
cells failed and exposed previously inaccessible EphA2 binding
sites (Fig. 4C). Over time, this front of cytotoxic T-cell activity
(see arrows) eventually moved all across the monolayer suggesting
sequential lysis at the exposed edge.
To determine if newly exposed EphA2 epitopes could bind
bscEphA2xCD3, we disrupted a small portion of an intact MCF10A
monolayer. Redirected T-cell lysis was largely confined to the outer

(B), or 100 ng/mL of bscEphA2xCD3 (C and D ). Immediately before addition of the T cells, the indicated monolayers were scraped with a pipette. Time-lapsed
microscopy was recorded for 20 h with approximately one picture exposed per minute (see Supplementary Data). Images represent specific time intervals as indicated
after the addition of T cells. ‘‘Intact monolayer’’ and ‘‘disrupted monolayer’’ represent two separate experiments. C, white arrows, edge of the MCF10A monolayer

edges of the disrupted monolayer where EphA2 previously
occluded by intercellular junctions were now available to bind
bscEphA2xCD3 (Fig. 4C, disrupted monolayer). Our observation
that redirected T-cell lysis of the MCF10A cells located at the
disrupted edges of the monolayer provided initial evidence against
the idea that central cells may be more resistant to bscEphA2xCD3mediated killing than those growing at the edge. To further explore
this possibility, we used a bscAb that targets CD3 and a different
molecule (EpCAM) on MCF10A cells by an epitope that is not
subject to exclusion. When exposed to this particular EpCAM/
CD3–specific bscAb, T cells were able to lyse MCF10A cells across
the entire monolayer (Fig. 4B). Cytotoxic activity of the T cells was
further increased where the monolayer was intentionally disrupted
(Fig. 4B, disrupted monolayer), thus showing that even the central
cells were sensitive to redirected lysis. To confirm the specificity of
the cytotoxicity reactions, we used a control bscAb molecule that
could associate with T cells but not MCF10A cells. This control
bscAb did not affect the cell monolayer (Fig. 4A and B), and the

T cells moved over the monolayer and remained randomly
distributed on top of the MCF10A cells during the period of
observation. Together, these studies provide further evidence that
bscEphA2xCD3 exhibits the property of epitope exclusion and may
provide a means for the selective targeting of malignant cells that
express these EphA2 epitopes.
BscEphA2xCD3 is efficacious in vivo. To determine if the
potent ex vivo activity of bscEphA2xCD3 would translate to
inhibition of tumor growth in vivo, an adoptive transfer model was
used. Immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice were engrafted with a
s.c. mix of EphA2-positive human colorectal cancer SW480 cells
and unstimulated human CD3+ T cells from healthy donors. At the
beginning of the experiment, animals were then treated with five
daily i.v. doses of bscEphA2xCD3. A bscAb that binds CD3 and
another human-specific target (CD19) that is not expressed on
the SW480 tumor cells was used as the control. Treatment
with bscEphA2xCD3 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), whereas the human CD19/

CD3–specific bscAb (nonrelevant control) had no such effect on
SW480 tumor outgrowth. The control bscAb had no effect on
tumor growth; similarly, the PBS vehicle or five 20-Ag doses of
bscEphA2xCD3 administered in the absence of T cells did not alter
growth of tumor (Fig. 5B). Tumors grew equally well after
engraftment of SW480 cells alone or after engraftment of SW480
cells mixed with T cells. Thus, in the absence of bscEphA2xCD3
treatment, T cells alone had no effect on tumor growth.
To determine if the presence of peripheral and lymphoid
human T cells might absorb bscEphA2xCD3 and potentially reduce
its antitumor efficacy, we used the xenograft model of SW480
cells combined with human T cells and added additional peripheral human T cells by i.v. administration. NOD/SCID mice were
engrafted s.c. with a mix of SW480 tumor cells and human T cells
as done above. In parallel and before the first bscAb treatment,
mice were injected i.v. with unstimulated human CD3+ T cells,

which in a separate experiment were shown to remain viable and
circulating in the animals for at least 3 days (Fig. 5D). Notably,
injection with excess human T cells in the periphery did not alter
the antitumor efficacy of bscEphA2xCD3 (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
In this study, we report the development of a novel EphA2/CD3–
targeting bscAb that stimulates T cells to selectively kill tumor cells
that express accessible EphA2 epitopes. BscEphA2xCD3 is active
in vitro and in vivo and thus provides a potent means of killing
tumor cells. Different criteria reveal the high potency and
selectivity of bscEphA2xCD3 to lyse targets cells at relatively low
concentrations (picomolar, ng/mL) and against tumor cells that
express a wide range of antigen densities. Additionally, tumor lysis
can approach 100% and occur at low (1:1) E/T ratios. Given the

flow cytometry at the indicated time points after engraftment for the presence of viable, human CD3+ T cells that excluded propidium iodide. Percentage of viable
human CD3+ T cells was compared with the total number of live and dead cells contained within the mouse spleen. The half-life (s 1/2) of human T cells in the mice was
estimated using a one-phase exponential decay, nonlinear regression analysis. Note: Previous studies suggest that after s.c. administration, human T cells are
viable for at least 8 d when combined with human tumor cells (32, 34, 37).

highly potent tumoricidal effects of diverse bscAbs of the BiTE
class (27), we designed a new EphA2/CD3–specific bscAb from an
EphA2-specific antibody, which recognizes an epitope that is
preferentially exposed on transformed cells (18). Altogether, the
potency and selectivity of bscEphA2xCD3 suggest that there is an
opportunity to develop a highly potent, but well-tolerated, new
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of the many cancers that
overexpress EphA2.
The past decade has shown that chimeric and humanized mAbs
provide a means of selectively targeting malignant cells while
sparing toxicities to normal tissues (20). A growing number of these
mAb-based cancer therapeutics is available and efficacious (20)
However, the efficacy of mAb therapy for cancer treatment remains
limited (20), which prompted the search for and development of
new antibody-based technologies with improved antitumor efficacy
(44, 45), including bscAbs of the BiTE class (27). Our present study
illustrates certain potential advantages that BiTE molecules may
convey relative to conventional antibody therapies. One possible
advantage is that bscEphA2xCD3 and another BiTE (MT103/MEDI538) show potent tumor cell killing in vitro and in the clinical
setting (46), respectively, at concentrations that are magnitudes
lower than have been associated with standard biologics-based
therapies (21–23). Likewise, recent clinical information suggests
that mAb therapies may encounter certain limitations that should
not affect BiTE antitumor efficacy. For example, single nucleotide
polymorphisms of FcRgIIIa may limit antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxic activity of naked mAbs (24–26); BiTE activity
does not depend on Fcg receptors for its activity (27). The relatively
small size of bscAbs (55–60 kDa) may also facilitate better
penetration into solid tumors (47). Although these features are
promising, further analyses will be necessary to fully understand
the differences in functional properties of BiTE molecules
compared with other active or passive immune strategies.
EphA2/CD3–specific bscAbs may also have advantages relative
to active immunotherapy for EphA2-expressing cancer. For
example, innate tolerance to certain antigens has limited the

usefulness of tumor vaccine approaches (48). In contrast, BiTE
molecules may be insensitive to disease-associated desensitization
of T cells that recognize tumor (27, 49). Tumors often display
alterations in HLA expression or antigen processing and presentation, which can limit the effectiveness of active immunotherapy
(50). BiTE molecules are unlikely to be affected by such tumor
resistance mechanisms (28).
Tumor vaccines may need to mount a robust immune response
to overcome tolerance. However, a potent tumor vaccine may also
elicit autoimmune or inflammatory responses to normal tissues
that express the antigen, or which are subject to epitope
spreading, which could limit the clinical application of active
immunotherapy (48). BiTE molecules are unlikely to show such
effects, and, indeed, they may provide opportunities to combine
the specificity of antibody-based therapies with the potent killing
power of T lymphocytes. A further potential advantage of the
BiTE approach is that it could make use of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes that frequently are observed within the solid tumor
microenvironment (35, 49). EphA2/CD3–specific bscAbs are
designed to recruit these T cells and redirect their activity in a
tumoricidal manner.
In summary, our present findings suggest opportunities for using
an EphA2/CD3–directed bscAb of the BiTE class in cancer therapy.
The overexpression of EphA2 in certain types of solid tumors and
its relatively low expression in normal tissue may be exploited to
develop therapies that maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity
to normal tissues.
