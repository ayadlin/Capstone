therapeutic hyperthermia is a consequence of heat shock
simultaneously affecting protein dynamics in multiple pathways,
including the response to radiation-induced DNA double-strand
breaks (2). Clinical trials have shown that when therapeutic
hyperthermia is used as an adjuvant with ionizing radiation,
significant improvement in local-regional control can be achieved
(3, 4). Phase III clinical studies established that radiation therapy
combined with adjuvant therapeutic hyperthermia can produce
significant local control in disease refractory to ionizing radiation
(4, 5). However, for many cancers, suboptimal thermal doses limit
radiosensitization (6). Thus, small molecules designed to enhance
hyperthermia have the potential to improve radiotherapy outcomes.
Consideration of the mechanisms by which heat shock induces
radiosensitization offers an opportunity for innovative chemistrydriven drug discovery of small molecules that convert subtherapeutic hyperthermic exposures into efficacious thermal doses
that yield robust radiosensitization. The foremost molecular event
governing thermal radiosensitization is the unfolding and aggregation of a subset of cellular proteins (2). Heat shock–mediated
alterations of the biophysical properties of irradiated chromatin,
temperature-dependent inhibition of DNA double-strand break
ligation (1), and the usurping of signal transduction pathways are
mainly a consequence of protein unfolding and aggregation (7).
Thus, thermal destabilization of protein conformation represents
an underlying biophysical process that can be exploited.

Abstract
Radiation therapy combined with adjuvant hyperthermia has
the potential to provide outstanding local-regional control for
refractory disease. However, achieving therapeutic thermal
dose can be problematic. In the current investigation, we used
a chemistry-driven approach with the goal of designing and
synthesizing novel small molecules that could function as
thermal radiosensitizers. (Z)-(F)-2-(1-Benzenesulfonylindol3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol was identified
as a compound that could lower the threshold for Hsf1
activation and thermal sensitivity. Enhanced thermal sensitivity was associated with significant thermal radiosensitization. We established the structural requirements for activity:
the presence of an N-benzenesulfonylindole or N-benzylindole
moiety linked at the indolic 3-position to a 2-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol) or 2-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one)
moiety. These small molecules functioned by exploiting the
underlying biophysical events responsible for thermal sensitization. Thermal radiosensitization was characterized biochemically and found to include loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, followed by mitotic catastrophe. These
studies identified a novel series of small molecules that
represent a promising tool for the treatment of recurrent
tumors by ionizing radiation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):695–701]

Introduction
The use of ionizing radiation is essential for the management of
many human cancers. Technological advancements allow achievement of outstanding physical targeting of ionizing radiations to
tumor tissue, sparing normal tissue and providing the potential
for definitive local-regional control. Local-regional control is the
primary requirement for preventing progression to devastating
invasive disease. Unfortunately, local-regional control is not always
obtained in many cases of aggressive disease. Thus, there is an
urgent need for development of radiation sensitizers.
Therapeutic hyperthermia is one of the most potent radiation
sensitizers identified to date (1). Radiosensitization produced by

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of indole-N-substituted (Z)-(F)-2-(indol-3-ylmethylene)1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ols. Indole-N-substituted (Z )-(F)-2-(indol3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ols and related non-indolic
compounds were prepared by aldol condensation of the appropriate
N-substituted indole-3-carboxaldehydes/arylcarboxaldehyde with 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one to afford the corresponding N-substituted indol3-ylmethylene/arylmethylene-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one. The 3-keto
analogue could be reduced to the corresponding indole-N-substituted
(Z )-(F)-2-(indol-3-ylmethylene/arylmethylene)-1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octan3-ol with sodium borohydride in methanol.
Assays. Hyperthermia was done in temperature-controlled water baths.
A Pantak orthovoltage X-ray machine was used to irradiate cells at 2.05
Gy/min (300 kVp). Colony formation was used to quantitate cell survival.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The nuclear mobility of
Mre11-GFP in a stably transfected HCT116-Mre11-GFP fusion protein cell
line was measured by a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
methodology (FRAP), using a Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal fluorescence
microscope. Please see Supplementary Methods for a detailed description.

Gel mobility shift assays, determination of mitochondrial membrane
potential, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and 53BP1
immunofluorescence. Gel mobility shift assays were done as described
in (8). Mitochondrial membrane potentials were determined by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis using the fluorescent dye JC-1 (Molecular
Probes/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 53BP1 immunofluorescence was determined in MCF7 cells using a monoclonal antibody against 53BP1 that was
a gift from Dr. J. Chen (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT).

HT29 colon carcinoma cells, which are intrinsically resistant to
heat shock (12), were used as a model in a comparative structureactivity analysis. In the initial experiments, cells were exposed to
150 Amol/L of compounds I to V (Fig. 1) for 2 to 4 h at either 37jC
or 41jC. At 37jC, compounds I to V were nontoxic: the plating
efficiency (13) was not statistically significant from control
(P > 0.05, Student’s t test; data not shown). These initial experiments identified (Z)-(F)-2-(1-benzenesulfonyl-indol-3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol (compound V) as a potent
enhancer of thermal dose. Whereas a 2-h/41jC thermal treatment
was nontoxic, as measured by colony formation (Supplementary
Fig. S1A; P > 0.05 Student’s t test), incubation in the presence of
compound V at this temperature significantly increased thermal
sensitivity (P < 0.05, Student’s t test).
Hyperthermic radiosensitization is directly related to thermal
sensitization. Thus, the thermal-sensitizing properties of compound V produced significant thermal radiosensitization, yielding
a thermal enhancement ratio of f3, calculated at a survival level
of 50% (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S1B; P < 0.05, Student’s t test).
In contrast, radiation sensitivity was not affected by noncytotoxic
treatments consisting of a 41jC exposure in the absence of
enhancer, exposure to compound I or IV during thermal treatment,
or exposure to enhancer at 37jC before x-irradiation (Supplementary Fig. S1B; P > 0.05, Student’s t test). Similar results were
obtained in MCF-7 and H460 cells (data not shown).
Hyperthermic doses capable of producing radiosensitization
induce a fraction of nuclear Mre11, a component of the Mre11Nbs1-Rad50 DNA double-strand break sensing complex, to
translocate to the cytosol (14, 15). Using FRAP, we have further
observed that the fraction of Mre11 that remains in the nucleus
during therapeutic hyperthermia undergoes a progressive heatdependent loss of mobility. This was shown using HCT116 cells

Results and Discussion
(Z)-(F)-2-(indol-3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan3-ols (IMZO-3-ol) function as enhancers of thermal dose.
Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug shown to
lower the temperature required for initiation of the heat shock
response (9, 10) and the threshold temperature for hyperthermic
radiosensitization (10). Thus, the N-benzoylindole moiety of the
indomethacin molecule represented a structural platform upon
which a chemistry-driven synthesis approach could be initiated.
A series of novel indole-N-substituted IMZO-3-ols, their corresponding 3-keto analogues, and other structurally related nonindolic compounds were synthesized (Fig. 1) and were structurally
characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis, and
elemental combustion analysis. X-ray analysis was used to identify
the molecular geometry, conformation, stereochemistry, and
atom connectivity of two representative analogues (see Fig. 1, V
and VI; ref. 11). The indole rings in these two compounds are
planar, and the benzene ring of the benzenesulfonyl group makes
a dihedral angle of 90.2 degrees (compound V) or 94 degrees
(compound VI) with the mean plane of the indole ring. In both
analogues, the double bond connecting the azabicyclic and indole
moieties has the Z geometry.

Chemical Enhancement of Thermal Radiosensitization

radiosensitization. A, HT-29 cells were incubated at either 37jC (curves A and B) or 41jC (curves C and D ) for 4 h in the absence (curves A and C ) or presence
(curves B and D ) of 150 Amol/L (Z )-(F)-2-(1-benzenesulfonyl-indol-3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol (curves B and D) incubated for 10 min at room
temperature and then x-irradiated with the indicated doses at room temperature. Cells were immediately washed, and survival was determined by measuring
colony-forming ability 10 to 15 days later. Cells designated as control were exposed to DMSO as a vehicle control. A thermal enhancement ratio was calculated
at a survival value of 50%. B, normalized FRAP curves of nuclear Mre11-GFP were obtained at 37jC, 41jC, and at 43jC. Fluorescence intensity measurements.

function as an enhancer of a 2-h/41jC thermal treatment was
compared with molecules containing an N-benzylindole moiety
(XVI). Substitution of the N-benzenesulfonyl group in compound V
for an N-benzyl moiety (XVI) increased enhancer activity by 50%
(P < 0.05, Student’s t test; data not shown). The N-benzylindole
thermal sensitizing analogue (XVI) was also an effective thermal
radiosensitizer (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Thermal destabilization of protein is enhanced in the
presence of an indole-N-substituted IMZO-3-ol. Thermalmediated destabilization of protein conformation represents a
common underlying biophysical mechanism for hyperthermicinduced cell killing and thermal radiosensitization (2, 7, 16, 17).
Protein destabilization and unfolding also initiates the acquisition
of Hsf1 DNA-binding activity (18). Senisterra et al. (19) found that
the minimum temperature required for Hsf1 activation was
quantitatively the same as the minimum temperature that caused
cellular proteins with intrinsically low conformational stability
to unfold and denature. Hsf1 resides as a repressed monomer
due to its association with Hsp90. In the presence of unfolded
protein, Hsp90 disassociates from Hsf1, initiating Hsf1 trimerization and acquisition of DNA-binding activity (18). We therefore
used Hsf1 activation as a surrogate for measurement of (Z)-(F)-2(1-benzenesulfonylindol-3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan3-ol–mediated global protein denaturation. The data presented in
Fig. 3A and B illustrate significant enhancement of Hsf1 DNAbinding activity upon addition of compound V to cells incubated at
41jC for 2 or 4 h. Note that addition of an Hsf1 antibody retarded
DNA-binding activity, whereas addition of excess unlabeled HSE
oligonucleotides competed away DNA-binding activity (Fig. 3A).
Increased expression of Hsp70 mRNA was observed only upon
addition of compound V or the structurally related compound XVI
to a 4-h/41jC heat shock (Fig. 3C). Similarly, addition of compound
V increased translation of Hsc/Hsp70 (Fig. 3D).
The relationship between conformational stability of a protein
and the temperature of its environment are integrally related.

stably expressing a Mre11-GFP fusion protein. This Mre11-GFP
chimera functions similar to endogenous Mre11 in terms of
subcellular localization and response to irradiation (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and B). Thus, heat-mediated immobilization of nuclear
Mre11 can be used as a molecular signature of thermal radiosensitization.
Compound V enhanced heat-mediated Mre11-GFP chimera
immobilization in HCT-116 cells. Whereas, a 41jC thermal
pretreatment yielded a Mre11-GFP FRAP mobility curve that was
indistinguishable from the 37jC control curve (Supplementary
Fig. S3), a significant decrease in mobility was observed following
a 43jC thermal treatment (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Addition of compound V (0.25 mmol/L) to HCT116 Mre11-GFP
fusion cells incubated at 41jC significantly decreased Mre11-GFP
mobility, to a similar degree as was observed in the samples treated
at 43jC alone. The relationship between the immobile Mre11-GFP
fraction and time at hyperthermic temperatures is illustrated in
Fig. 2B. We conclude that the addition of an indole-N-substituted
IMZO-3-ol to a 41jC thermal treatment converted a thermal dose
that was subeffective in altering Mre11 mobility into one that
was capable of inhibiting Mre11 mobility. Taken altogether, the
data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that compound V can function
as a small-molecule enhancer of thermal radiosensitization and
is significantly more effective than indomethacin in that it
produces enhancement at a lower temperature and at lower
concentration (10).
Systematic structural modification of the 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]
octan-3-ol moiety was undertaken (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Oxidation of the hydroxyl group to a 3-keto group improved
enhancer activity (VI versus V: P < 0.05, Student’s t test), whereas
other structural modifications resulted in loss of enhancer activity
(compounds VII–X). Introduction of a methyl substituent into
the aromatic ring of the N-benzenesulfonyl moiety (compounds
XI–XV) also caused a loss of activity. The ability of molecules
containing an indole N-benzenesulfonyl moiety (compound V) to

database revealed a potential binding motif that is present in
numerous proteins.6
Pathway identification. Heat shock–mediated denaturation of
key proteins in critical pathways affects many cellular functions.
We surveyed several pathways known to be affected by heat shock
and irradiation (23–29). Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
(Dw m), an important initiator of cell death signaling (30, 31), can be
a consequence of heat shocks capable of denaturing protein and
activating Hsf1 (23). HT29 cells were incubated for 4 h at either
37jC or 41jC in the presence or absence of compound V. Cells
were then subjected to a flow cytometric bivariate analysis of JC-1
fluorescence, which is presented as the change in red fluorescent,
indicative of polarized mitochondrial membranes, versus green
fluorescent, representing depolarized mitochondria (Fig. 4). The
red to green emission fluorescence intensities yielded values of 1.4
and 1.1 in cells held at 37jC in the absence and presence of
enhancer, respectively. In cells incubated at 41jC, the values were
1.4 in the absence of enhancer and 0.2 in the presence of enhancer.
The shift to green fluorescence, observed in the entire population
of cells heated in the presence of compound V, indicates that a
significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Dw m)
occurred in these cells. Taken altogether, the data are consistent
with the hypothesis that drug-mediated thermal sensitization and

At physiologic temperatures, a protein resides in a spectrum of
natively folded states that exhibit varying degrees of stability and
that are only slightly more stable than unfolded conformations
(20). As temperature is increased, random thermal fluctuations
away from the most compact conformations (21) increase the
probability of transition to an unfolded state or states. This can
be measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a
procedure that detects heat absorbed as proteins unfold. In
living cells, this technique provides a direct physical measurement of protein destabilization and unfolding, yielding scans of
excess specific heat (C p) versus temperature (2). Analysis of DSC
profiles provides support the hypothesis that 2-(indol-3-ylmethylene)quinuclidines can function as small molecules that
enhance thermally mediated protein denaturation (Supplementary Fig. S6).
The conformational stability of a protein can be decreased by
the binding of small molecules (22). The demonstration of a
stringent structural requirement for thermal enhancement of cell
killing, the observation that indole-N-substituted (Z)-(F)-2-(indol3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ols function to lower
the temperature required for Hsf1 activation, coupled with the
DSC analysis suggest the hypothesis that these small molecules
recognize and associate with amino acid motifs present in many
cellular proteins, thereby decreasing the conformational stability
of a subset of cellular proteins and initiating thermal sensitivity.
To this end, we used compound XVI as bait in a peptide library
screen. Screening of the peptides against the Prosite Motif

not cytotoxic to cells held at 37jC (data not shown). The
frequency of multinucleation was not significantly affected if cells
were incubated at 41jC in the absence of enhancer or at 37jC
in the presence of enhancer (P > 0.05). Similar results were
observed in MCF7 cells (data not shown). Multinuclear events
increased 40% compared with irradiation alone, when cells were
exposed to a 2-h/41jC thermal treatment in the presence of
compound XVI 10 min before administration of 6 Gy (P < 0.05
Student’s t test). Neither the thermal treatment given alone nor
exposure to compound XVI at 37jC significantly increased
multinuclear events following irradiation (P > 0.05 Student’s
t test; Table 1A).
Multinucleated cells that undergo mitotic catastrophe contain
significant levels of sub-G1 DNA (36). We found that the
presence of an indole-N-substituted IMZO-ol-3-one (e.g., compound VI) increased the frequency of sub-G1 DNA in cells
exposed to a 4-h/41jC heat shock and in cells exposed to this
heat shock plus 6 Gy (2.5- to 3-fold compared with control;
P < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test; Table 1B). However, Annexin VFITC/propidium iodide staining of HT29 cells incubated at 41jC
for 4 h in the presence of enhancer was not significantly
different from that observed in control cells held at 37jC in the

hyperthermic radiosensitization are directly related to the ability of
compound V to initiate a loss of Dw m during heat shock.
The clonogenic survival assays shown in Fig. 2 yield little
mechanistic information concerning cell death pathways (32).
Apoptosis, necrosis, mitotic catastrophe, post-mitotic cell death,
and senescence can all contribute to a loss of clonogenicity in
heated and irradiated cells (32, 33). Mitotic catastrophe events,
defined as cell death occurring as a result of a deregulated or failed
mitosis (34), can follow loss of Dw m (29). Mitotic catastrophe can
be distinguished by formation of multinucleated and/or giant cells
(34, 35) that contain sub-G1 DNA (36). Examples of the
morphologic criteria used in this investigation are shown in
Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8. We found that neither a 4-h/41jC
thermal exposure by itself nor exposure to the small-molecule
enhancer at 37jC for 4 h induced multinuclei or giant cell
formation, whereas both were observed in cells incubated at 41jC
in the presence of enhancers V, VI, and XVI. Representative results
are illustrated below.
A 10-fold increase in multinucleated cells was observed
48 h following a 4-h/41jC exposure to compound VI (Table 1A;

absence of enhancer, measured 4 or 48 h after heat shock (data
not shown). The observations that mitotic catastrophe occurred
in cells lacking phosphatidylserine exposure is consistent with
the work of Zhang et al. (32). Taken altogether, these results
support the hypothesis that indole-N-substituted IMZO-ols and
IMZO-3-ones function as small-molecule enhancers of thermal
sensitivity and thermal radiosensitization by shifting cells into a
mitotic catastrophe pathway.
The loss of 53BP1 function is associated with both mitotic
catastrophe and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (37, 38).
Therefore, irradiation-induced 53BP1 containing foci formation
was used to interrogate 53BP1 function in cells incubated at
41jC for 4 h and then exposed to 2 Gy. Foci formation was moni
tored 0.5 to 8 h after irradiation in MCF 7 cells, as their optical
qualities are superior to HT29 cells. As stated above, compound
V enhanced the thermal sensitivity of MCF7 cells (data not
shown).
We observed a 10-fold increase in radiation-induced 53BP1
foci 30 min after cells received 2 Gy (Supplementary Fig. S9).
This increase takes into account foci present in unirradiated cells.
This level of radiation-induced foci was sustained for an additional
5.5 h, returning to control values 8 h after irradiation (data not
shown). A 4-h/41jC heat shock did not affect radiation-induced
53BP1 foci formation (Supplementary Fig. S9). Cells exposed to
compound V during a 4-h/41jC heat shock before administering
2 Gy exhibited a significant alteration in the appearance of 53BP1
foci (Fig. 5). Two morphologies were observed: a majority of the
cells exhibited a dim fluorescent pattern with lack of discrete
radiation induced foci. A few cells exhibited an intense 53BP1mediated congealed fluorescent signal. These changes were not
observed in cells exposed to compound V at 37jC, where normal

(C and D ). Some of the cells were then irradiated at room temperature with 2 Gy
(B and D ). One hour after irradiation, the cells were fixed and stained with
53BP1 antibody.

radiation-induced 53BP1 foci were observed. Thus, radiation
induced 53BP1 foci formation represents an additional pathway
affected by a (Z)-(F)-2-(1-benzenesulfonylindol-3-ylmethylene)-1azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol, consistent with a progressive increase
in mitotic catastrophe and increased radiation sensitivity observed
in this cell population.
In summary, we have exploited a chemistry-driven drug
discovery program for the purpose of developing small molecules
that could enhance the underlying biophysical and biochemical
pathways affected by heat shock that contribute to thermal
sensitivity and thermal radiosensitivity. This approach identified
(Z )-(F)-2-(1-benzenesulfonyl-indol-3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo
[2.2.2]octan-3-ol (compound V) as a small molecule that could
function as a thermal enhancer and established the structural
requirement for the presence of an N-benzenesulfonyl-indole or
N-benzyl-indole moiety linked at the indolic 3-position to a 2(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol) or 2-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan3-one) moiety. The synthesis of these small molecules represents
a promising tool for the clinical application of therapeutic
hyperthermia as a radiation sensitizer for the treatment of
recurrent tumors. As these molecules enhance multiple thermal
effects, it may be hypothesized that these agents have the
potential to enhance additional cancer therapies augmented by
hyperthermia, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy (39).
