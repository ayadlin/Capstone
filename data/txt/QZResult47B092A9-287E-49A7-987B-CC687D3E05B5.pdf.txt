ABSTRACT
Rap2b is a novel p53 target we have identified recently. Knockdown of Rap2b
sensitizes HCT116 cells to adriamycin-induced apoptosis, indicating that Rap2b
promotes adriamycin resistance in cancer cells. In the present study, we designed
a nanostructure-based drug/gene delivery system to evaluate the potential of
Rap2b siRNA as a therapeutic agent against human cancers. Specifically, after coincubated with HCT116 cells, adriamycin- and Rap2b siRNA-loaded gold nanoshells
were internalized. Subsequent laser irradiation promoted release of adriamycin
and Rap2b siRNA from the nanoparticles. The laser-induced release of Rap2b siRNA
decreased cellular expression of Rap2b and significantly enhanced the anticancer
therapeutic efficacy of adriamycin in vitro and in vivo. In addition, laser irradiation of
the nanoparticles might exert an additional thermal killing effect on cancer cells and
further improved the anticancer efficacy of adriamycin. In summary, Rap2b siRNA is
a potential enhancing agent for adriamycin-based anticancer therapeutics and the
gold nanoshell-based drug/gene delivery system carrying both adriamycin and Rap2b
siRNA provides a promising anticancer therapeutic strategy.

INTRODUCTION

of Rap2b sensitizes HCT116 colorectal cancer cells to
apoptosis induced by adriamycin (Adr), indicating that
Rap2b promotes Adr resistance in cancer cells [4]. These
data encourages us to establish a dual drug/gene delivery
system and co-deliver both Rap2b siRNA (siRap2b) and
Adr into cancer cells to enhance the anticancer therapeutic
efficacy of Adr.
As we know, nanoscale particles show numerous
advantages over conventional formulations in anticancer
therapeutics because of its unique outstanding magnetic,
photoelectric, and photothermal properties [7, 8]. To our
best knowledge, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are mostly
adapted to biomedical applications among numerous
nanoscale materials [9–11]. You, et al. have reported

Tumor suppressor p53 is identified as a DNA
sequence-specific transcription factor and a stress sensor
[1]. Upon various stresses, such as DNA damage, p53
is activated and then activates or represses numerous
downstream genes. These genes elicit various cellular
outcomes, such as cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and
apoptosis, which lead to tumor inhibition [1–4]. However,
p53 also activates certain target genes which in turn help
cancer cells survive, such as Hzf and IRF2BP2 [5, 6].
Rap2b, a novel p53 target we have identified recently, is
also such a gene [4]. Rap2b predominantly upregulates in
many types of human tumors (~80%). Down-regulation

that Adr-loaded hollow GNPs shows enhanced cytotoxic
effects in vitro and in vivo [12]. Moreover, Huschka,
et al. have confirmed that gold nanoshells and nanorods
are excellent nucleic acid carriers for gene therapy [13].
In addition, spherical nucleic acid nanoparticle conjugates
(SNAs) consist of densely packed siRNA oligonucleotides
surrounding an inorganic GNP core [14–18] and form a
platform for gene silencing. SNAs act as single-entity
agents capable of simultaneous transfection and regulation
of genes with no need for auxiliary carriers or cationic
transfection agents. Furthermore, SNAs are remarkably
stable in physiological environments and resistant to
nuclease degradation. Compared to conventional RNA
interference (RNAi) delivery platforms, SNAs provide
a more efficient and long-standing in vivo knockdown of
genes without triggering a significant immune response
and off-target effect [19–21].
Due to the superior features of GNPs, we designed a
drug/gene co-delivery system for oncotherapy in this study
using a gold nanoshell (GN), a member of GNP family
with a hollow structure [12, 22–24]. The chemically inert
and non-toxic GNs [9] enable a drug/gene accumulation in
tumors via an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
effect [25]. After PEGylation, the GNs possess an enhanced
circulation half-life in vivo [26, 27]. Moreover, GN
particles strongly absorb near infrared ray (NIR), which
induces photothermal energy conversion. The converted
energy can locally heat nanoscale volumes instead of
the bulk of solution volume [28]. This phenomenon is
commonly referred to as photothermal heating [23, 29]
and can be used to induce drug release from GNs [30] and
localized hyperthermia to kill cancer cells [31].
As shown in Figure 1, in this study, we synthesized
PEGylated GNs, to which Adr and siRap2b molecules
were conjugated, respectively. The conjugates were then
co-cultured with cancer cells or injected into tumorbearing mice. As expected, regardless of conjugation to
GNs, siRap2b significantly down-regulated the expression
of Rap2b in cancer cells. The most notable observation
in this study is that siRap2b greatly enhanced the
anticancer efficacy of Adr. Specifically, when irradiated
with a NIR laser, the GN complex released more Adr and
siRap2b molecules and leaded to an increased anticancer
therapeutic efficacy. In addition, laser irradiation might
also exert an additional thermal killing effect on cancer
cells. Taken together, our results revealed that siRap2b
significantly enhanced the anticancer therapeutic efficacy
of Adr and GN-based co-delivery of siRap2b and Adr
generated a promising anticancer therapeutic strategy.

in Figure 2A, the PEGylated GNs were characteristic of a
hollow structure with an average diameter of ~28 nm and
an absorption peak at 786 nm (Figure 2B).
Subsequently, we successfully conjugated Adr and
siRap2b molecules to the PEGylated GNs (Adr-GNs,
siRap2b-GNs), as shown in Figure 2B. The absorption
peak at 500 nm demonstrated that Adr molecules were
conjugated to the GNs. However, due to high background
absorption of GNs at 240–300 nm, the absorption peak
for siRap2b could not be clearly identified from the
UV spectrum of siRap2b-GNs. Therefore, we labeled
siRap2b with Rhodamine 123 (Rh123: excitation,
507 nm; emission, 529 nm), a green-fluorescent dye, at
the 3′ end of the sense chain. As shown in Figure 2B, the
absorption peak at 522 nm indirectly exhibited a successful
conjugation of siRap2b to GNs. On average, each GN
particle was loaded with 6 × 104 Adr or 200 siRap2b
molecules.

Laser-induced thermal effect and drug release
Laser irradiation can induce photothermal energy
conversion and thus heat a GN solution. As shown in
Figure 3A, upon exposure to an 808 nm laser (2 W•cm-2),
the temperature of the GN solution (pre-warmed in a 37°C
water bath) gradually increased to 44.7°C and 62.2°C at
1 min and 5 min post irradiation, respectively. Moreover,
upon laser irradiation, the temperature of the GN solution
increased much faster than that of a GN-free McCoy’s 5A
medium (P < 0.01).
To evaluate laser-induced drug release of GN
particles, we exposed the cells under an 808 nm laser
(2 W•cm-2) for 1 min to control the temperature under
45°C according to the results in Figure 3A. Then, we
measured drug release efficiency in a 37°C water bath. As
shown in Figure 3B, 3C, without laser irradiation, the GN
complex released Adr or siRap2b slowly to the solution.
Upon laser exposure, the release efficiency increased
sharply (P < 0.01). These data provide us a guideline for
the in vivo study on laser-induced drug release.

Cellular uptake of Adr-GNs and siRap2b-GNs

RESULTS

To measure the maximum cellular accumulation
time of GNs, uptake of Adr-GNs and siRap2b-GNs
were carried out in HCT116 cells. As shown in Figure 4,
fluorescence intensity showed a similar dynamics in the
cells incubated with Adr-GNs or Rh123-labeled siRap2bGNs (Rh123-siRap2b-GNs). The fluorescence intensity
increased in the beginning, reached a maximum at 4 h,
and then gradually decreased to an undetectable level.

Preparation of GNs, Adr-GNs and siRap2b-GNs

Rap2b knockdown

To prepare the GNs, we employed a common
approach by reducing HAuCl4 onto silver nanoparticles [12]
and then PEGylated the freshly prepared GNs. As shown

To evaluate the knockdown efficiency of Rap2b
caused by siRap2b-GNs, we performed quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western

drug-loaded GNs were treated with an 808 nm laser. The laser treatment generated a photothermal effect, which greatly accelerated drug
release. The released Adr killed cancer cells directly. Moreover, the released siRap2b significantly decreased the expression of Rap2b and
thus leaded to an enhanced anticancer therapeutic efficacy. In addition, laser-induced thermal effect exerted a direct thermal killing effect
on cancer cells/tissues.

blot analyses. The mixture of siRap2b and Lipofectamine®
2000 (siRap2b-lip2000) was used as an active control. The
results demonstrated that when compared with untreated
controls, siRap2b-GNs successfully down-regulated
the mRNA (Figure 5A and 5B) and protein (Figure 5C
and 5D) levels of Rap2b in both HCT116 and MCF-7
cells. Moreover, the knockdown efficiency caused by
siRap2b-GNs was similar to that by siRap2b-lip2000. In
addition, down-regulation of Rap2b expression was also
evaluated using the cells treated with Adr (1 μM, 8 h),
a genotoxic chemical that results in an increase in the
expression of Rap2b [4]. When treated with siRap2bGNs+Adr, both HCT116 and MCF-7 cells successfully
maintained significantly low levels of Rap2b mRNA
(Figure 5A, 5B) and protein (Figure 5C, 5D), which
was similar to that in the siRap2b-lip2000+Adr controls.
Collectively, siRap2b-GNs treatment successfully downregulated the expression of Rap2b in the absence and
presence of Adr, indicating the applicability of GNs for
siRNA delivery in this study.

To evaluate the efficacy of siRap2b in killing
cancer cells by Adr in vitro in a GN-based platform
for drug delivery, we first performed an MTT
(methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay.
As shown in Figure 6A, Free Adr treatment resulted in a
reduction in the cell viability in a concentration-dependent
manner, which was similar to the results reported by
Li et al. [32]. However, combination of Free Adr and
siRap2b-lip2000 resulted in a significant decrease in cell
viability in a lower concentration of Adr (≤ 0.32 μg/mL)
(P < 0.05). Similarly, when we conjugated Adr and
siRap2b molecules to GNs, Adr-GNs+siRap2b-GNs
treatment showed a stronger killing effect than AdrGNs treatment. Moreover, when we further exposed
Adr-GNs and Adr-GNs+siRap2b-GNs treated HCT116
cells to an 808 nm laser (2 W•cm-2) for 1 min, we
observed an enhanced reduction in cell viability

(P < 0.01). Specifically, Adr-GNs+Laser treatment
displayed a capability to kill cancer cells similar to that
caused by Free Adr+siRap2b-lip2000 treatment, and
superior to that caused by Free Adr or Free Adr+Free
siRap2b treatments (P < 0.05). Furthermore, additional
siRap2b-GNs enhanced the capability of Adr-GNs+Laser
to reduce cancer cell viability in lower concentrations
of Adr (0.02 and 0.04 μg/mL) (P < 0.01), indicating the
highest killing effect on HCT116 cells in this study.
Next, we analyzed the cellular killing effect based
on the concentration of GNs. As shown in Figure 6B, Free
GNs didn’t show significant cytotoxicity to HCT116 cells
in all GN concentrations we tested. This is consistent with
the common view that in general, Au-based nanoparticles
are well tolerated [12]. Moreover, loading of Adr endowed
the GNs with a cellular killing effect when the GN
concentration ranged from 0.00278 nM to 0.0188 nM
(P < 0.05), whereas loading of both Adr and siRap2b onto
GNs showed a better killing effect with a broader GN
concentration ranging from 0.00164 nM to 0.0188 nM
(P < 0.05). Furthermore, upon laser illumination, GNs
showed an obvious killing effect on HCT116 cells with
concentrations ranging from 0.00164 nM to 0.0188 nM

(P < 0.05). Loading of Adr enhanced the cellular killing
effect of GNs+Laser with GN concentrations ranging from
0.001071 nM to 0.0188 nM (P < 0.01), whereas loading
of both Adr and siRap2b further enhanced the killing
effect of Adr-GNs+Laser treatment even with a lower GN
concentration ranging from 0.001071 nM to 0.00164 nM
(P < 0.01).
Taken together, our in vitro results indicated that
siRap2b enhanced the killing effect of Adr on HCT116
cells and the most efficient strategy was a combination
of Adr-GNs and siRap2b-GNs coupling with laser
irradiation.

Enhanced role of siRap2b in treating HCT116
tumors with Adr in vivo
To explore the potential of siRap2b for anticancer
therapeutics, we evaluated the enhanced role of siRap2b
in the Adr treatment of HCT116 tumors in a nude mouse
model. In this study, a GN-based platform was used for
drug delivery. As shown in Figure 7A, 7C, the tumors in
the saline treated mice grew faster than those of the mice
in any other treatment (P < 0.05). The tumor volume was

reduced by 43% at 15 days post administration of AdrGNs, which was similar to that in the Free Adr group
(~42%). However, after laser irradiation, the tumors in
the Adr-GNs+Laser group was reduced by 82% in mean
volume, exhibiting a more significant decrease than that
in the non-irradiation group (P < 0.01). As expected, the
mean tumor volume in the Adr-GNs+siRap2b-GNs treated
mice was reduced by 78%, demonstrating a significant
improvement in the therapeutic efficacy over the AdrGNs group (P < 0.01). Laser treatment further enhanced
the tumor inhibition effect  of Adr-GNs+siRap2b-GNs
with a 93% reduction in the tumor volume, indicating the
highest inhibition efficiency among all treatment groups
(P < 0.01).
Furthermore, the mean body weight of mice
bearing HCT116 tumors continually increased in the AdrGNs+siRap2b-GNs+Laser group during the 15 d treatment
period (Figure 7B), whereas a significant decrease was
observed in the mean body weight (20 g to 14 g) of the
saline treated group (P < 0.05) (Figure 7B). For other
groups of mice, the mean body weight only slightly
increased or decreased during the whole treatment period
(P > 0.05). All animals survived through the whole 15 d
treatment period and no significant toxic side effect was
observed in the in vivo therapeutic study.
Together, our in vivo results demonstrated that
siRap2b enhanced the anticancer therapeutic efficacy
of Adr in a nude mouse model and Adr-GNs+siRap2bGNs+Laser treatment was the most efficient therapeutic
strategy compared with others in this study.

these problems via tumor targeting and MDR circumvention
[33–35]. Basically, MDR falls into two distinct categories,
pump and nonpump resistances [34, 36]. The major
mechanism of nonpump resistance development is via
activation of cellular anti-apoptotic defense, which is mainly
mediated by oncogenes, such as bcl-2. Currently, targeting
nonpump resistance is one of the important strategies in
anticancer therapeutics. As reported by Alex, et al. [37],
co-delivery of Adr and bcl-2 siRNA by nanoparticles
successfully enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy against
multidrug-resistant cancer cells. Recently, we have reported
that Rap2b possesses a pro-survival function in cancer cells
[4], indicating that Rap2b is a nonpump resistance gene and
a promising anticancer target.
As we know, RNAi-based gene silencing
has emerged as a promising approach in anticancer
therapeutics. However, many factors limit RNAi-based
therapeutics in the clinical practice. These factors include
lack of efficient drug delivery, various enzymes promoting
RNA degradation in the systemic circulation, limited
biological activity, and unfavorable safety profile [38].
Nanotechnology has provided feasible solutions for these
problems. Recently, tumor targeting capability of GNs
has been confirmed in numerous studies [31, 39, 40]. It
has been reported that SNAs can form a unique microenvironment that inhibits enzymatic degradation of nucleic
acids and thus results in an increased stability of siRNAs
[14, 15, 20] and potentially longer therapeutic lifetimes.
Moreover, scientists have used SNAs as an effective RNAibased therapeutic agent for glioblastoma [16, 19, 21]. In
this study, we designed a nanoparticle-based drug/gene
co-delivery system to evaluate the potential of siRap2b as
an anticancer therapeutic agent.
In the current study, the GNs were coated with PEG
via thiol-Au bonds, and then Adr and siRap2b molecules
were conjugated to GNs via amino-Au and thiol-Au bonds,

DISCUSSION
There are two major problems in cancer
chemotherapy, toxic side effect and multidrug resistance
(MDR). Nanoparticle-based drug delivery can overcome

the in vitro study, the killing effect of Adr-GNs was lower
than that of Free Adr (P < 0.05). This discrepancy mainly
results from the tumor targeting capability of GNs caused
by an EPR effect [31, 39, 40], which allows nanoparticles
to passively accumulate in tumors [26]. Specifically, The
GN particles directionally delivered and slowly released
Adr molecules to the tumor sites. Upon laser treatment,
more Adr molecules were released from the nanoparticles,
resulting in a higher Adr concentration in the tumor tissues
than that by administration of free Adr. As a result, the
Adr-GNs+Laser and Adr-GNs+siRap2b-GNs+Laser
treatments exhibited a higher tumor killing effect than
others. Furthermore, in contrast to Adr-GNs and AdrGNs+Laser treated mice, additional siRap2b-GNs resulted
in a significant reduction in the tumor growth, indicating an
enhancing role of siRap2b in the anticancer therapeutics.
In the current research, we studied the role of
siRap2b in the improvement of anticancer capability
of Adr in a GN-based drug/gene co-delivery system.
However, additional studies are needed before
potential clinical trials, such as on immunogenicity and
pharmacokinetics parameters, both of which are important
indexes to estimate the applicability of nanoparticles
for clinical practice. Moreover, our data indicated that
without laser exposure, the loaded Adr and siRNA also
showed a slow release from the GNs. Before we translate
this nanoformulation into clinical practice, we should
reduce this off-target background release. Besides
intrinsic and passive targeting of nanoparticles via an
EPR effect, a critical way is via fast and active tumor
targeting. Therefore, in the future, we will modify and
conjugate some tumor antigen specific ligands, such
as EGFR antibody and RGD peptide, to the surface of
GNs for an enhanced active targeting [41, 42]. Due to
the ligand-driven active targeting, the modified GNs will
accumulate in tumors faster than that passively driven by
an EPR effect [27] and thus lead to a less off-target drug
release. Besides, many other technologies and methods
can be adapted for drug loading or modification of GNs
to optimize the nanoformulation for an appropriate
administration and delivery [43].

respectively. Since an amino-Au bond is weaker than a thiolAu one, excessive PEGylation will competitively inhibit
abundant Adr from bonding to GNs. Therefore, we slightly
modified the reported protocol to achieve a reasonable
drug loading rate. Our data demonstrated that GN particles
could be functionalized to deliver both Adr and siRap2b
into cancer cells. The internalized siRap2b successfully
decreased the expression of Rap2b and enhanced the
anticancer therapeutic efficacy of Adr. Moreover, laser
irradiation leaded to a local increase in temperature
(Figure 3A) and thus greatly accelerated cellular release of
Adr (Figure 3B) and siRap2b (Figure 3C), which further
improved the therapeutic efficacy. In addition, we optimized
the laser treatment condition and exposed the cells to an
808 nm laser irradiation (2 W•cm−2) for 1 min in order to
control the temperature under 45°C. Under such a condition,
thermal killing effect may not be apparent. Therefore, we
can reasonably evaluate the role of siRap2b in enhancing
the anticancer therapeutic efficacy of Adr. Furthermore, as
shown in Figure 5, there is space to improve the knockdown
efficiency of Rap2b. Predictably, if we can further modify
the protocol to conjugate more siRap2b molecules to GNs,
we will obtain a better knockdown efficiency and thus a
better anticancer therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, one future
direction is to optimize the conjugation protocol so as to
improve the loading efficiency of siRap2b. Furthermore, as
shown in Figure 6, there was no obvious difference in cell
viability inhibition between Adr-GNs+siRap2b-GNs+laser
and Adr-GNs+laser when the concentration of Adr was
≥ 0.08 μg/mL. It might be that the higher concentrations
of Adr are sufficient to kill cancer cells. Thus, another
future direction is whether siRap2b can also enhance
the therapeutic efficacy of Adr against Adr resistant
cancer cells.
Encouraged by the exciting in vitro killing effect of
Adr- and siRap2b-loaded GNs on cancer cells, we further
performed an animal study to evaluate the therapeutic
efficacy in vivo. Overall, the in vivo and in vitro results
showed a similar trend of anticancer therapeutic efficacy.
Interestingly, in the in vivo study, the anticancer efficacy
of Adr-GNs was similar to that of Free Adr, whereas in

Preparation of GNs
GNs were prepared by reducing HAuCl4 onto silver
nanoparticle templates [12]. In brief, silver nanoparticles
were prepared by adding 2 mM NaBH4 into a well stirred
solution of 4 μM AgNO3 and 10 μM sodium citrate. The
reaction produced a characteristic yellow color and was
allowed to stir at 60°C for ≥ 2 h, followed by cooling to
room temperature. Then, silver particle growth was initiated
by adding 4 mM NH2OH•HCl to the resulting silver sol
and continued to stir for 5 min. Next, 0.1 M AgNO3 was
added to the sol and turned it dark yellow or orange. After
stirring for ≥ 2 h (often overnight), the sol was heated
to 60°C. Then, 0.5 mM HAuCl4 was added into the sol,
followed by stirring for 1 h. GNs started to form in the sol
via replacement chemistry. Once the reaction was complete,
the sol was cooled down and silver chloride was allowed
to precipitate. Next, the supernatant containing GNs was
transferred to another vessel and stored at 4°C until use. GN
concentration was calculated as 5 × 1010 mL−1, based on the
method by Prevo, et al. [23].
Subsequently, the GNs were modified with MPEGSH-2000 via thiol-Au bonds [44] for steric stabilization
and in vivo circulation half-life enhancement [26, 27].
PEGylation were performed according to the published
protocol with slight modifications [12]. In brief, the GNs
(6 × 1012 mL−1) were added into an aqueous solution
containing 3 × 10−10 M MPEG-SH-2000. The reaction
proceeded overnight at room temperature. PEGylated GNs
were purified by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 20 min
and the pellet was resuspended in deionized water. The
process was repeated twice to remove unreacted MPEGSH-2000 molecules.

Adr and siRap2b loading onto GNs
Adr-GNs and siRap2b-GNs were prepared according
to the reported methods with slight modifications
[12, 45, 46]. In brief, Adr molecules were conjugated to GNs
via amino-Au bonds formed between its active amino groups
and gold nanoparticles. An aliquot of free Adr in water
(0.35 mg, 0.1 mL) was added into an aqueous solution of
PEGylated GNs (6 × 1012 particles, 1 mL), and the mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. After centrifugation

Knockdown of Rap2b

(14000 rpm for 20 min), the precipitate was washed with
PBS and centrifuged. All supernatants were collected and
pooled together. The amount of free Adr in the supernatant
was determined by spectrophotometry at 480  nm. The
loading efficiency (LE) of Adr was estimated using two
methods. The first one indirectly measures attached Adr by
determining the amount of unbound Adr in the supernatant
according to equation 1: LEindirect = (total amount of Adr used
– amount of free Adr in the supernatant)/total amount of
GNs. The second one directly quantifies attached Adr after
extraction of Adr from dried GNs with DMSO according
to equation 2: LEdirect = total amount of Adr extracted from
GNs/total amount of GNs. Both calculations showed that,
on average, 6 × 104 Adr molecules were conjugated to the
surface of each GN particle.
Similar to generation of Adr-GNs, siRap2b-GNs
were produced by conjugating SH-5′-siRap2b-3′-Rh123 to
GNs via thiol-Au bonds with a slight difference in reaction
condition, that is, 40 μg of SH-5′-siRap2b-3′-Rh123 was
added into 1 mL of a PEGylated GN solution containing
6 × 1012 particles in DEPC-treated water. The LE of
siRap2b was quantified indirectly according to the equation:
LE = (total amount of siRap2b used – amount of siRap2b
in the supernatant)/total amount of GNs. In the end, about
200 siRNA molecules were loaded onto each GN particle.

Cancer cells (5 × 104 per well) were seeded in a
12-well plate. One day later, the cells were incubated
for 48 h with siRap2b-GNs (0.5 nM) carrying
100 nM siRap2b or siRap2b-lip2000 mixture containing
100 nM siRap2b. Untreated cells were used as a control.
For further analysis of Rap2b knockdown in the presence
of Adr, cancer cells were incubated with siRap2b-GNs
or siRap2b-lip2000 for 40 h, followed by an additional
incubation with 1 μM Adr for 8h. The cells treated with
1 μM Adr were used as a control in this context. Knockdown
efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR and western blotting.

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the cells using Trizol
reagent and dissolved in DEPC-treated water. Reverse
transcription was performed with a HiFiScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit. Real-time PCR was carried out in duplicates
with a total volume of 10 μL using EvaGreen 2 × qPCR
MasterMix. Reactions were run in a LightCycler® 480
Real-time PCR system (Roche). The results were analyzed
using the built-in software LightCycler® 480 version 1.5.
Rap2b mRNA levels were normalized to that of 28S.
The relative Rap2b mRNA levels were calculated by
comparing the normalized values to that of untreated cells,
the value of which was set to 1.

Measurement of laser-induced thermal effect
1012 GN particles were resuspended in 2 mL of
McCoy’s 5A medium in a centrifuge tube. The tube was
placed in a 37°C water bath and then exposed to an 808
nm laser (2 W•cm−2). Solution temperature was monitored
at different time point post irradiation. In the meanwhile,
a same volume of GN-free McCoy’s 5A medium was used
as a negative control.

Western blotting
The cells were lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer containing
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and 1 U/ml DNase I on ice
for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 12000 g for
10 min at 4°C. The lysate concentration was determined
by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Fifty micrograms of
total protein was separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBST
(1 × PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for
1 h, and incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight
and secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h.
Subsequently, the membrane was developed in an UltraECL
solution (YuanPinHao Bio, Beijing, China). Images were
obtained from a Tanon-5200 Chemiluminescence Apparatus.
For multiple detections, the membrane was stripped
with Stripping Buffer (CWBiotech, China). The primary
antibodies used in this study were against Rap2b and β-actin.
The secondary antibody was HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG.

Adr and siRap2b release from GNs
Two milliliters of Adr-GNs or siRap2b-GNs
(1012 particles/mL) in each tube was placed in a 37°C
water bath. The samples were divided into 2 groups: one
was for irradiation, the other not. At predetermined time
intervals, the samples were irradiated with an 808 nm
laser (2 W•cm−2) for 1 min. The nanoparticle solution was
centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min and Adr or siRap2b in
the supernatant was determined for analysis of the amount.

Cellular uptake of Adr-GNs and siRap2b-GNs
HCT116 cells were seeded in confocal dishes
(Φ35 mm) and incubated for 24 hours, then replaced with
1 mL of culture medium containing 3 × 1011 nanoparticles.
After incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h, the cells were
washed with PBS and then imaged under a laser confocal
microscope. The cellular fluorescent intensity was analyzed
using the built-in image analysis software LAS X and the
mean value was calculated based on the data from 10 cells.

In vitro killing of cancer cells
Cell viability assay was carried out to evaluate the
killing effect of drug-loaded GNs on HCT116 cells with
or without irradiation. HCT116 cells (3000 per well) were
seeded into a 96-well plate and cultured for 24 h prior to
the following 7 groups of treatments:

Group 1: siRap2b-GNs+Adr-GNs+Laser. Adr-GNs
(0.0183, 0.00914, 0.00457, 0.00228, 0.00114, 0.000571
nM) carrying corresponding concentrations of Adr (0.64,
0.32, 0.16, 0.08, 0.04, and 0.02 μg/mL, respectively)
were added into the wells in quadruplicates. In addition,
all wells were added with siRap2b-GNs (5 × 10-4 nM)
carrying an average of 200 siRap2b/GN. Four hours later,
GN accumulation reached a maximum in cancer cells
(Figure 4). Then, the cells were exposed to an 808 nm laser
(2 W•cm−2) for 1 min and cultured for an additional 44 h.
Group 2: siRap2b-GNs+Adr-GNs. Cells were
treated according to the protocol described in Group  1
except without laser irradiation. Both Adr-GNs and
siRap2b-GNs were co-cultured with the cells for a
continuous 48 h.
Group 3: Adr-GNs+Laser. Cells were co-incubated
with different concentrations of Adr-GNs which were
consistent with those in Group 1. Free GNs (5 × 10−4 nM)
were added into the wells to make total amount of GN
particles consistent with those in Groups 1 and 2. Laser
irradiation was performed according to the protocol in
Group 1.
Group 4: Adr-GNs. Cells were treated with Adr-GNs
for 48h using the protocol described in Group 3 except
without a laser irradiation.
Group 5: Free Adr. Cells were treated for 48 h with
different concentrations of free Adr (0.64, 0.32, 0.16, 0.08,
0.04, and 0.02 μg/mL).
Group 6: Free Adr+Free siRap2b. Cells were
treated for 48h with 0.1 nM free siRap2b plus various
concentrations of Adr described in Group 5.
Group 7: Free Adr+siRap2b-lip2000. The protocol
was similar to that carried out in Group 6 except that the
siRap2b was premixed with 2 volumes of lip2000.
Group 8: Free GNs+Laser. In compliance with
the final GN dosages in Groups 1–4, Free GNs (0.0188,
0.00964, 0.00507, 0.00278, 0.00164, 0.001071 nM) were
added into the wells followed by a 48 h co-incubation.
Laser irradiation was performed according to the protocol
in Group1.
Group 9: Free GNs. Cells were treated with Free
GNs for 48 h using the protocol described in Group 8
except without a laser irradiation.
The concentrations of Adr were consistent in Groups
1–7, and those of GNs were consistent in Groups 1–4, 8,
and 9. Upon treatment, MTT solution was added into each
well. After an additional 4 h incubation, the absorbance
of each well was measured at 490 nm with a microplate
reader.

free GNs (1.25 nmol/kg); (Group D) Same to Group C;
(Group E) Adr-GNs (0.0857 nmol/kg) plus siRap2b-GNs
(1.25 nmol/kg) carrying siRap2b of 0.25 μmol/kg;
and (Group F) Same to Group E. The total amount of
GN particles was identical in Groups C, D, E, and F. In
addition, at 6 h post injection [25], all tumor sites in Groups
D and F were exposed to an 808 nm laser (2 W•cm−2) for 1
min. Therapeutic efficacy of each drug/laser treatment was
evaluated by measuring tumor volume and body weight of
each mouse every three days. At the end of 15 d treatment
period, all mice were sacrificed and tumors were resected
for photography.
