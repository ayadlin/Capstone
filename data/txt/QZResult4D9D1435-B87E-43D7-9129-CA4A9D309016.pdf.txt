Abstract
Docetaxel chemotherapy improves symptoms and survival in
men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer
(HRPC). However, f50% of patients do not respond to
Docetaxel and are exposed to significant toxicity without
direct benefit. This study aimed to identify novel therapeutic
targets and predictive biomarkers of Docetaxel resistance in
HRPC. We used iTRAQ-mass spectrometry analysis to identify
proteins associated with the development of Docetaxel
resistance using Docetaxel-sensitive PC3 cells and Docetaxelresistant PC3-Rx cells developed by Docetaxel dose escalation.
Functional validation experiments were performed using
recombinant protein treatment and siRNA knockdown experiments. Serum/plasma levels of the targets in patient samples
were measured by ELISA. The IC50 for Docetaxel in the PC3-Rx
cells was 13-fold greater than the parent PC-3 cell line (P =
0.004). Protein profiling identified MIC-1 and AGR2 as
respectively up-regulated and down-regulated in Docetaxelresistant cells. PC-3 cells treated with recombinant MIC-1 also
became resistant to Docetaxel (P = 0.03). Conversely, treating
PC3-Rx cells with MIC-1 siRNA restored sensitivity to Docetaxel
(P = 0.02). Knockdown of AGR2 expression in PC3 cells resulted
in Docetaxel resistance (P = 0.007). Furthermore, increased
serum/plasma levels of MIC-1 after cycle one of chemotherapy
were associated with progression of the cancer (P = 0.006) and
shorter survival after treatment (P = 0.002). These results
suggest that both AGR2 and MIC-1 play a role in Docetaxel
resistance in HRPC. In addition, an increase in serum/plasma
MIC-1 level after cycle one of Docetaxel may be an indication to
abandon further treatment. Further investigation of MIC-1 as a
biomarker and therapeutic target for Docetaxel resistance in
HRPC is warranted. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7696–703]

Introduction
Prostate cancer remains the third most common cause of cancer
death in men in the developed world (1). As prostate cancer
progresses it becomes refractory to hormone manipulation.
Docetaxel chemotherapy offers both symptomatic and survival
benefits in men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate

cancer (HRPC; refs. 2, 3); however, only 48% to 50% of men treated
with Docetaxel have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response
with a >50% decrease in their serum PSA. A high proportion of
patients experience significant toxicity with 42% experiencing
nausea, vomiting, or both, 30% any grade of sensory neuropathy
and 26% z1 serious adverse event (2). Clearly, it would be ideal to
know before or early in the treatment schedule which patients will
respond to Docetaxel to avoid use of a toxic drug in an elderly
population. Furthermore, identifying new pathways of resistance to
Docetaxel may result in new therapeutic options.
Several pathways have been implicated in Docetaxel resistance
including the Clusterin (4), Bcl-2 (5), Stat1 (6), sphingosine kinase-1
(7), PIM1 kinase (8), IL-6 (9), and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt pathways (10). Anti-sense oligonucleotide inhibition of
Bcl-2 (11), inhibition of PI3K signaling with CCI-779, mammalian
target of rapamycin inhibitor (10), and sphingosine kinase-1
inhibition with B-5354c (7) have all resulted in improved tumor
kill in HRPC xenograft models. However, a phase II trial of
Oblimersen Sodium, an antisense inhibitor of Bcl-2, and Docetaxel
in HRPC resulted in response rates comparable with, but not better
than, those seen in the landmark Docetaxel randomized control
trials (2, 3, 5). As yet no drug has made a clinical impact on
Docetaxel resistance.
Identifying predictive biomarkers in men with HRPC is complex.
The evolution to metastatic HRPC is the result of many changes in
the biology of the cancer (12) and may develop 10 years or more
after the original diagnosis. Therefore, tissue from the original
cancer many years earlier does not reflect what the cancer becomes
in its more advanced stage. Men with HRPC do not have tumor
tissue that is easily accessible for rebiopsy as 80% have bone
metastases only. Plasma/serum biomarkers are the practical
alternative for this patient group and the strategy most likely to
result in direct translation to the clinical setting. Serum IL-6 levels
have been associated with Docetaxel response (9) but there are no
plasma/serum biomarkers used in clinical practice. The aim of this
study was to identify potential plasma/serum biomarkers that
might predict response to Docetaxel and assess the functional role
of these molecules in Docetaxel resistance in vitro.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and selection of Docetaxel-resistant clones. The human
androgen–independent prostate carcinoma cell line, PC3, was obtained
from American Type Culture Collection and was maintained in RPMI 1640
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 mg/mL streptomycin. Cells were initially cultured in 1 ng/mL Docetaxel
and maintained until the Docetaxel-sensitive clones died. The surviving PC3
cells repopulated the flask and continued to divide through four passages.
This process was repeated using a Docetaxel concentration of 5 ng/mL and

subsequently 10 ng/mL. Once PC3 cells were freely dividing in 10 ng/mL
Docetaxel medium, they were considered resistant and labeled PC3-Rx.
Trypan blue cell viability assay. To establish cytotoxicity profiles of
Docetaxel, the number of cells surviving the drug treatment was determined
by the trypan blue exclusion assay (13). Cells were plated into T25 flasks at
1  105 cells/flask. Twenty-four hours later, spent medium was replaced
with fresh medium containing Docetaxel at different concentrations (0, 1.6,
8, 40, 200, 1,000, and 5,000 ng/mL). Treated cells were harvested with
trypsin/EDTA at 48 h, stained with trypan blue, and counted using a
hemocytometer. Cell counts were performed in triplicate for each time
point and drug concentration. The cell survival curve was presented as the
percentage of surviving cells versus the concentration of Docetaxel. IC50
values were defined as the concentration of drug required for 50% cell
survival. This was calculated by analysis of the data in Excel using a logistic
equation with data fitted using the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm. This
experiment was repeated on three separate occasions and the results are
expressed as the means F SEM.
Clonogenic assays. The cells were plated into six-well plates for 48 h,
before the addition of Docetaxel (1.6, 8, 40 ng/mL). After 1 h of incubation,
the drug-containing medium was removed and replaced with normal
medium. Medium was changed every 3 d for 7 to 10 d until visible colonies
formed. Colonies were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in
methanol. Individual stained colonies in each well were visualized by the
Bio-Rad Chemidoc system and counted by QuantityOne (Bio-Rad).
Rhodamine accumulation assay. PC3 and PC3-Rx cells were plated at
5  105 cells per well into 24-well plates for 24 h. The medium was then
replaced with medium containing either vehicle, Cyclosporin A (1 mmol/L),
or PSC833 (1 mmol/L; Novartis) and allowed to incubate for 10 min at 37jC
before the addition of Rh123 (1 mmol/L; Invitrogen Australia). A final
concentration of 0.15% (v/v) ethanol was used for all experiments and
controls. Cells were incubated in the dark for 60 min at 37jC, then
transferred to ice and maintained at 0jC while they were harvested using

trypsin-EDTA, and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer with a 488-nm
argon laser using CellQuestTM software (BD). Rh123 fluorescence was
measured by a 530-nm band-pass filter and propidium iodide fluorescence
measured with a 585-nm band-pass filter. Gates were set to exclude
propidium iodide–positive cells and clumps and debris on the basis of
forward and side scatter.
iTRAQ-mass spectrometry analysis. Sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and peptide identification were performed as described in (14).
Cells were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.15% SDS, 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail 1 tablet; Roche] to a
final concentration of 2 mg/mL. One hundred micrograms of protein for
each sample was reduced, alkylated, and enzymatically cleaved using trypsin,
then derivatized using iTRAQ 4-plex reagent kit (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (14). The iTRAQ-labeled samples
were mixed and separated by strong cation exchange chromatography,
followed by nanoLC/MS/MS using a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (Applied
Biosystems). Peptides were identified and quantitated from MS/MS data
using ProteinPilot V1.0 (Applied Biosystems). All reported data were based on
95% confidence for protein identification as determined by ProteinPilot
(ProtScore > 1.3). A further requirement was for a protein P value, which
ensured that protein identification and quantitation was based on more
than a single peptide hit.
Data analysis. To identify secreted proteins, all data in the July 2006
version of the Secreted Protein Databank (SPD) were downloaded and the
associated SwissProt IDs for peptides identified by mass spectrometry
were matched to the same University of California at Santa Cruz Table
Browser file (Human Assembly March 2006). For all matches, the SPD ranks
(0–3) were recorded. These data were then combined in an Excel
spreadsheet for analysis of candidate proteins based on SPD rank and
proteomic fold-change.

Western blotting analysis. Primary antibodies used were anti–MIC-1
(R&D Systems) and anti-AGR2 (Abnova Corporation). Secondary antibodies
were protein G-HRP (Zymed) or antimouse IgG (GE Healthcare UK).
The cells were lysed with a radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer
with protease inhibitors (1.0 mmol/L Sodium orthonavadate, 1.0 mmol/L
NaF, 1.0 mmol/L PMSF, 0.1 Amol/L Aprotinin, and 10 Amol/L Leupeptin).
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm 4jC for 6 min and the protein
concentration of the soluble extracts determined using the Bio-Rad
(Bradford) protein assay (Bio-Rad). For collection of conditioned media,
PC3 and PC3-Rx cells were seeded at a density of 1  106 cells in T-75 flasks
in RPMI with 10% FBS for 24 h. The media were replaced, the cells
incubated for 72 h, and media then collected, centrifuged, and stored at
80jC. Separation of 30 Ag of total protein was performed on 12%
acrylamide gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane before
immunoblotting with the relevant primary antibodies. The equal loading of
protein sample was verified with h-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase–specific antibodies (Sigma).
Recombinant MIC-1 experiments. PC3 cells were treated with
human recombinant MIC-1 at 0.01 ng/mL (rMIC-1; R&D Systems) for
72 h, before the exposure to Docetaxel. A dose response curve was
established using increasing concentrations of Docetaxel (0, 1.6, 8, 40, 200,
1,000, and 5,000 ng/mL) as described earlier. A clonogenic assay was also
performed by treating the cells with 5 ng/mL Docetaxel for 1 h then
replacing the medium with fresh nondrug containing medium and allowing
colonies to grow over 7 to 10 d as described earlier.
Small interfering RNA transfection. siGenome SMARTpool small
interfering RNA (siRNA) against MIC-1 or AGR2, and siCONTROL
NonTargeting siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon Research, Inc. The
nonsilencing control siRNA, which has no sequence homology to any
known human gene sequence, was used as a control for nonsequencespecific effects in all experiments. Cells were transfected with siRNA by
electroporation using Nucleofector Technology (Amaxa Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The optimal amount of siRNA used for
transfection was determined empirically for each cell line and the lowest
siRNA concentration that gave effective silencing of the targeted protein
and caused minimal stress to the cells was used in all subsequent
experiments. Control experiments were done in parallel by transfecting
the cells with the control siRNA at equivalent concentrations as the

target siRNA. The efficacy of the siRNA knockdown was assessed by
immunoblotting. The effect of MIC-1 and AGR2 knockdown on the
Docetaxel sensitivity of PC3-Rx and PC3 cells, respectively, was assessed
using increasing concentrations of Docetaxel (0, 1.6, 8, 40, 200, 1,000, and
5,000 ng/mL) as described earlier to produce a dose response curve. Given a
small inhibitory effect from the control siRNA and the transfection
technique, all analyzes were performed comparing the control siRNA to
the targeted siRNA conditions.
To assess the synergy between the different pathways that enhance
Docetaxel resistance, PC3 cells were treated with (a) siRNA control, (b) rhMIC-1
at 0.01 ng/mL, (c) siRNA targeted to AGR2, or (d) rhMIC-1 0.01 ng/mL + AGR2
siRNA. The cells were then treated with Docetaxel at 40 ng/mL for 48 h at
which time cell viability was assessed by the Trypan Blue assay.
Patient samples. Blood samples for biomarker analysis were obtained
from 43 men with metastatic HRPC precycle and postcycle one of
chemotherapy. Serum samples were obtained from 28 patients treated
with Docetaxel and PI-88, an heparanase inhibitor, on a clinical trial (15).
Plasma samples were obtained from 15 patients receiving single agent
chemotherapy (13 Docetaxel, 2 Mitoxantrone). The serum/plasma concentrations of MIC-1 (pg/mL) were analyzed using a previously described
sensitive immunoassay (16). Serum PSA levels were recorded before each
cycle of treatment. Patients had a baseline PSA level of z10 ng/mL. PSA
response (partial response, PR) was defined as a 50% or greater decrease in
serum PSA compared with the last value assessed before initiation of
chemotherapy (2, 3). PSA progression (progressive disease, PD) was defined
as an increase in PSA value by 25% over the baseline, and stable disease
(SD) was defined as any change in PSA of z50% decrease or V25% increase
over baseline (2). Confirmatory PSA levels were not required to define a
response. Overall survival was defined as the time from commencement of
chemotherapy to the time of death or last follow-up. Prospective Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status assessment was available
on 28 patients all of whom were performance status of 0 or 1 (17).
Statistical analysis. An unpaired Student’s t test was used for statistical
analysis of comparative in vitro data that were expressed as means of at
least three independent experiments F SEM. The dose response curves
were compared using a multiple regression of the percentage of viable cells
according to the cell line/cell treatment adjusted for the Docetaxel
concentration. As serum MIC-1 levels were not normally distributed,
nonparametric methods (Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis) were used
to determine the relationship between the serum/plasma levels of MIC-1
and PSA response to chemotherapy. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank

statistic were used to assess the association between increased MIC-1 levels
and overall survival. A Cox Proportional Hazards model was used for
bivariate analyses assessing the relationship between change in MIC-1
levels, age, and performance status. A P value of <0.05 was required for
significance. All reported P values are two sided. All statistical analyses were
performed using Statview 4.5 software (Abacus Systems).

Results
Identification of novel proteins associated with Docetaxel
resistance. The Docetaxel-resistant cell line, PC3-Rx, was developed from the Docetaxel-sensitive, androgen-independent prostate
cancer cell line, PC3. The IC50 for Docetaxel in the PC3-Rx cells was
13-fold higher than that in parental PC-3 cells (P = 0.004; Fig. 1A).
Clonogenic assays also showed significant Docetaxel resistance in
the PC3-Rx compared with PC3 cells (Fig. 1B). Despite changes in
Docetaxel sensitivity, the morphology (Fig. 1C) and growth rate of
the PC3 and PC3-Rx cells were similar (Supplementary Fig. S1).
There was no difference in Rh123 accumulation between PC3 and
PC3-Rx cells, with/without P-glycoprotein inhibitor, Cyclosporin A,
or PSC833 (Fig. 1D). This showed that Docetaxel resistance was not
due to drug efflux.
Proteomic profiling was used in the discovery phase to identify
potential targets involved in Docetaxel resistance. A single lysate
sample of each of the PC3-Rx and PC3 cells were profiled using
iTRAQ mass spectrometry. This process identified and quantitated
f1,100 proteins (Supplementary Table S1). Data mining identified
secreted proteins with a fold change >1.5, as these proteins would
be the most likely to be found in plasma. Based on the fold change
criteria, 50 proteins were up-regulated and 35 proteins down-

regulated in PC3-Rx cells compared with PC3 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2), but only 7 of these proteins were secreted (Table 1). MIC-1
and AGR2 were the top ranked secreted protein targets (Table 1).
Validation of protein expression. To verify that the candidate
proteins were selectively up-regulated or down-regulated in drugresistant cells, we analyzed protein levels in cell lysates and
conditioned media. This confirmed that MIC-1 was expressed at
low levels in PC-3 cells and markedly overexpressed in resistant
PC3-Rx cell lysates and conditioned media (Fig. 2A). Furthermore,
AGR2 was expressed at lower levels in PC3-Rx cells compared with
PC-3 cells (Fig. 2B).
MIC-1 and Docetaxel resistance. To delineate a potential
functional role of MIC-1 in chemoresistance, Docetaxel-sensitive
PC-3 cells were treated with recombinant human MIC-1 (rhMIC-1)
at 0.01 ng/mL for 72 hours. This resulted in the PC-3 cells
becoming relatively resistant to Docetaxel with an 8-fold increase
in the IC50 (P = 0.03; Fig. 3A). Clonogenic assays also showed a
significant increase in Docetaxel resistance when PC3 cells were
treated with MIC-1 (P = 0.001; Fig. 3B). Moreover, in the clonogenic
assays, there was increased Docetaxel resistance with increasing
concentrations of the MIC-1. These results suggest that exogenous
MIC-1 promotes Docetaxel-resistance in PC3 cells. MIC-1–targeted
siRNA were used to knockdown MIC-1 expression in PC3-Rx cells
by 15-fold (Fig. 3C). Cell viability assays showed that MIC-1 siRNA–
treated, PC3-Rx cells were significantly more sensitive to Docetaxel
treatment than control siRNA–treated PC3-Rx cells with an 8-fold
decrease in the IC50 (P = 0.02; Fig. 3D).
AGR2 and Docetaxel resistance. The role of AGR2 in Docetaxel
resistance was assessed using siRNA targeted to AGR2. AGR2-targeted

siRNA knocked down AGR2 expression in PC3 cells by 10-fold
(Fig. 4A). Cell viability assays showed that AGR2 siRNA–treated,
Docetaxel-sensitive PC3 cells developed resistance to Docetaxel
compared with PC3 cells treated with control-siRNA with a 5-fold
increase in the IC50 (P = 0.007; Fig. 4B).
To assess for synergy between AGR2 and MIC-1, PC3 cells were
treated with either AGR2-siRNA or rhMIC-1 or both and Docetaxel
sensitivity assessed. All three conditions resulted in relative
Docetaxel resistance compared with parental PC3 cells (Fig. 5C).
There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased Docetaxel

resistance in the AGR2-siRNA, rhMIC-1–treated PC3 compared
with either of the treatments alone (P > 0.05; Fig. 4C).
Serum/plasma MIC-1 levels predict for Docetaxel resistance.
Plasma/serum samples were collected from a cohort of 43 men with
metastatic HRPC treated with chemotherapy (13 Docetaxel alone,
28 Docetaxel/PI-88, 2 Mitoxantrone). Docetaxel/PI-88 treatment
was part of a phase II clinical trial in which this combination was
found to be comparable with Docetaxel alone (15). Given a previous
study implicating MIC-1 in Mitoxantrone resistance (18), patients
treated with this drug were also included. Of the 43 patients, 26
(60%) had PR, 10 (23%) had SD, and 7 (17%) had PD as best response
to treatment. The median follow-up was 52 weeks (range, 7–123
weeks) with 32 of 43 (74%) dead of prostate cancer.
The median pretreatment MIC-1 level was 5,525 pg/mL (range,
730–65,305 pg/mL). Men with a performance status of 0 had a
significantly lower pretreatment MIC-1 level compared with men
with performance status 1 (mean pretreatment MIC-1 level, 2,855
versus 9,214; P = 0.01). This is consistent with data demonstrating
that weight loss is associated with elevated MIC-1 levels (19), a
factor often associated with poorer performance status. There was
no relationship between the pretreatment MIC-1 level and
response to treatment (P = 0.6).
Of the original cohort, 38 patients (28 Docetaxel/PI-88,
8 Docetaxel alone, 2 Mitoxantrone) had paired samples prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy. The mean change in serum/
plasma MIC-1 after the first dose of chemotherapy was associated
with response to treatment (P = 0.02; Fig. 5A) with a correlation
between elevated MIC-1 levels after initial treatment and resistance
to therapy (P = 0.006; Fischer’s Exact test). All men who had PD
despite treatment had elevated MIC-1 levels after cycle one of treatment (Fig. 5B). Exclusion of the two men treated with Mitoxantrone
did not alter the results (data not shown). An increase of z140%
in MIC-1 levels after cycle 1 of chemotherapy was associated with a
shorter overall survival (Fig. 5C). Bivariate analysis showed that
serum/plasma MIC-1 levels (P = 0.005) could predict poorer survival
independent of performance status (P = 0.2) and age (P = 0.4).

In this study, protein profiling has successfully identified two
secreted molecules that potentially mediate Docetaxel resistance
and one serum/plasma protein biomarker that may predict for
Docetaxel resistance in the clinical setting. This is the first article to
show that down-regulation of AGR2 induces Docetaxel resistance
in HRPC cells. Furthermore, it shows that elevated plasma/serum
MIC-1 levels after initial Docetaxel treatment can predict for
Docetaxel resistance in men with HRPC, indicating that further
chemotherapy is not warranted and may be harmful.
AGR2, the human homologue of the Xenopus laevis cement
gland protein, has been implicated in the progression and
metastasis of numerous cancers. AGR2 was originally identified
in a screening of genes differentially associated with estrogen
receptor status in breast cancer cell lines (20). Subsequently, AGR2
was identified as an androgen-inducible secretory protein overexpressed in prostate cancer epithelium (21). Increased AGR2 is also
associated with decreased survival in men with localized prostate
cancer (22). Functionally, AGR2 expression promotes tumor growth,
cell migration, and transformation in vitro (23, 24) and an increased
rate of metastasis in vivo across a range of cancers (25), although no
mechanism has yet been identified. Silencing of AGR2 in a
pancreatic cell line improved sensitivity to the cytotoxic drug,

AGR2 and MIC-1 in Docetaxel Resistance

Figure 5. Serum/plasma MIC-1 levels in men with HRPC treated with
chemotherapy. The relationship between the change in MIC-1 levels after
chemotherapy and the response to chemotherapy is shown in A by Kruskall Wallis
analysis comparing PD, SD, and PR as measured by PSA levels and in B by
Waterfall plot assessing the differences between responders (PR ) and
nonresponders (PD/SD ). C, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrating the
effect increased MIC-1 levels after cycle one of chemotherapy on overall survival.

Gemcitabine (24). In contrast, our study found that decreased levels
of AGR2 were associated with Docetaxel resistance.
The cytokine MIC-1, a member of the transforming growth
factor (TGF)h family, has been implicated widely in prostate
carcinogenesis and progression. MIC-1 expression is increased in
precancerous prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, with low MIC-1
expression in localized prostatic cancer predicting for increasing
stage of disease (26). Furthermore, low levels of stromal expression
of the unprocessed propeptide form of MIC-1 predict for
biochemical relapse in localized cancer especially in tumors with
Gleason scores of V6 (27). In the context of therapy, MIC-1 is
overexpressed in colon cancer cells that become senescent after
chemotherapy (28) and MIC-1 expression is elevated in localized
breast and prostate cancer tissue after neoadjuvant Docetaxel
(18, 29). Although these data imply that MIC-1 is being produced by
the tumor cells in response to cytotoxic treatment, there is also
data for a functional role for MIC-1 in drug resistance. Increased
MIC-1 is associated with 5-fluorouracil resistance in colon cancer
cell lines (30) and overexpression of MIC-1 conferred resistance to
Docetaxel and Mitoxantrone in advanced prostate cancer (18). Our
results are consistent with this but we also found that knock down
of MIC-1 confers Docetaxel sensitivity. Furthermore, this is the first
time that serum/plasma levels of MIC-1 have been associated with
Docetaxel resistance in HRPC. If the changes in serum/plasma
MIC-1 reflected tumor cell senescence, then one would expect that
patients with a high level would have a better outcome; however,
elevated levels of MIC-1 predict for both PD and shorter survival in
this study.
The precise mechanism by which MIC-1 exerts its biological
effects is still unclear. The activation of the p53 pathway induces
MIC-1 expression that corresponds to activating p53 mutations in
many cancers (31). High MIC-1 levels in vitro and in vivo are
associated with apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and antiangiogenic

activity consistent with antitumor activity (31). Conversely, MIC-1
treatment of prostate cancer cells also results in loss of cellular
adhesion (32), and increased MIC-1 has been associated with the
progression to androgen independence (33) and the formation of
lytic bone metastases in vivo (34). Furthermore, higher MIC-1
expression in gastric cancer cell lines is associated with a more
invasive phenotype suggesting MIC-1 may also have a protumorigenic role (35). These apparently contradictory effects are typical of
the TGFh superfamily reflecting factors in the cancer and its
environment and the concept that these molecules may have
divergent effects at different stages of the disease. Our data are
consistent with the more protumorigenic effect described in the
advanced stages of metastatic prostate cancer. MIC-1–treated
breast and gastric cancer cell lines activate Akt and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 via transactivation of ErbB2 (36). PI3K/
Akt signaling has also been implicated in Docetaxel resistance (37)
and is one potential explanation for how MIC-1 modulates
Docetaxel resistance.
Although our data suggest that the functional and biomarker
aspects of MIC-1 are linked, one could hypothesize that plasma
MIC-1 levels increase in PD due to increased tumor burden. Serum
MIC-1 levels have been linked to tumor burden in other studies
(31, 38); however, in prostate cancer, serum levels of MIC-1 are an
independent marker of higher-grade (Gleason sum 7) tumors
(16, 39), not stage and lymph node spread, suggesting that these
findings are not solely due to tumor burden (39). Furthermore,
elevated serum MIC-1 levels predict for bone metastases (16) and
cachexia due to prostate cancer (19) with in vitro and in vivo
studies demonstrating the functional role of MIC-1 in these
processes (19, 34). Given that the median survival of men with
HRPC is 16 months without Docetaxel treatment (2), it is also
inconsistent with the tumor growth characteristics that the tumor
burden would increase z40% in the 3 weeks between the

pretreatment and postcycle 1 blood sampling. There is significant
evidence that serum MIC-1 reflects biological aspects of prostate
cancer rather than simply tumor burden, which is consistent with
our data suggesting it predicts, and also plays a biological role, in
Docetaxel resistance.
Serum/plasma biomarkers that can predict for chemosensitivity
early in treatment will significantly improve patient care for
men with HRPC. This group of men is generally over 60 years of
age, often with multiple medical comorbidities, and Docetaxel
treatment has significant side effects while benefiting only f50%
of the patient group. There was considerable variance in the
pretreatment MIC-1 levels most likely due to a number of factors
such as tumor volume, bone metastases, and cachexia, which also
affect serum MIC-1 level in HRPC. The finding in this study that the
change in MIC-1 levels after the first cycle of treatment correlates
with PSA response offers new hope for a predictive biomarker. The
median time to PSA response in the TAX327 study was 44 days
(range, 26–68 days), so most patients had two or more cycles of
treatment before response status could be ascertained (40).
Identifying response after one cycle of treatment (21 days) would
prevent cumulative toxicity in those patients unlikely to benefit
from treatment. Although a larger, more homogenous study
population will be needed to validate these findings, these data
provide new evidence for MIC-1 as a predictive biomarker.

In conclusion, AGR2 and MIC-1 both mediate Docetaxel
resistance in HRPC cells in vitro and the correlative human data
suggest MIC-1 may be a predictive serum/plasma biomarker for
Docetaxel response in these patients. This offers the opportunity
for therapeutic intervention against Docetaxel resistance by an
anti–MIC-1 neutralizing antibody and/or pegylated peptide
treatment with AGR2. The MIC-1 data provide the biological
principles for the development of a plasma biomarker that could
predict for early Docetaxel resistance and direct the appropriate
therapeutic intervention.
