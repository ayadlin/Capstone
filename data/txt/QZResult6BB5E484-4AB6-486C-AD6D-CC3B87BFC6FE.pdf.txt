Drugs that inhibit estrogen receptor-α (ER) activity have been highly successful in treating and reducing breast cancer progression
in ER-positive disease. However, resistance to these therapies presents a major clinical problem. Recent genetic studies have shown
that mutations in the ER gene are found in 420% of tumours that progress on endocrine therapies. Remarkably, the great majority
of these mutations localize to just a few amino acids within or near the critical helix 12 region of the ER hormone binding domain,
where they are likely to be single allele mutations. Understanding how these mutations impact on ER function is a prerequisite for
identifying methods to treat breast cancer patients featuring such mutations. Towards this end, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome
editing to make a single allele knock-in of the most commonly mutated amino acid residue, tyrosine 537, in the estrogenresponsive MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Genomic analyses using RNA-seq and ER ChIP-seq demonstrated that the Y537S mutation
promotes constitutive ER activity globally, resulting in estrogen-independent growth. MCF7-Y537S cells were resistant to the antiestrogen tamoxifen and fulvestrant. Further, we show that the basal transcription factor TFIIH is constitutively recruited by ERY537S, resulting in ligand-independent phosphorylation of Serine 118 (Ser118) by the TFIIH kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)7.
The CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1 prevented Ser118 phosphorylation and inhibited growth of MCF7-Y537S cells. These studies conﬁrm the
functional importance of ER mutations in endocrine resistance, demonstrate the utility of knock-in mutational models for
investigating alternative therapeutic approaches and highlight CDK7 inhibition as a potential therapy for endocrine-resistant breast
cancer mediated by ER mutations.

INTRODUCTION
As the major driver of breast cancer development and progression, estrogen receptor-α (ER) is the pre-eminent target in 80% of
breast cancers. Inhibition of ER activity with anti-estrogens or
aromatase inhibitors (AI) for preventing estrogen biosynthesis,
reduces relapse and improves patient survival.1,2 However, in
many patients tumours progress on these therapies, where
resistant tumours are mostly ER-positive and frequently responsive to changes in endocrine agent,3–6 although typically with
shorter periods of response to second and third line endocrine
treatments. Efforts to identify changes in ER that functionally act in
resistance have shown that mutations in the ER gene are rare in
primary breast cancer.7–9 However, new ﬁndings conclusively
demonstrate that the ER gene (ESR1) is frequently mutated in
advanced breast cancer; combining data from different reports
indicates that ESR1 coding region mutations feature in about 20%
of AI-resistant breast cancer.10–14 The rarity of ESR1 mutations in
primary breast cancer, as well as the lack of ESR1 mutations in
matched primary samples from patients in which ESR1 mutations
are evident after progression on endocrine therapies, indicates
that treatment-selective pressures are likely to drive the acquisition of ESR1 mutations. Recent analyses of circulating tumour
DNA further supports treatment-selective acquisition of ESR1
mutations,15,16 and droplet digital PCR has identiﬁed ESR1

mutations in a proportion of primary tumours at very low mutant
allele frequencies,17 suggesting that endocrine treatments may
lead to selection of cancer cells with pre-existing ESR1 mutations.
The great majority of the mutations identiﬁed in advanced
breast cancer occur in the ER ligand binding domain (LBD), with a
‘hotspot’ at the consecutive amino acids L536, Y537 and D538,
which map to the loop connecting α-helices 11 and 12. Structural
analyses indicate that these residues control the agonist state of
the LBD and that their mutation stabilizes the receptor in the
agonist state, to promote co-activator recruitment18,19 and thus
aid transcription of ER target genes. Functional studies following
ectopic expression of ER in which L536 or Y537 were substituted
by other amino acids showed ligand-independent activation of
estrogen-responsive reporter genes and interaction with coactivator proteins.13,20–25 Although ER mutated at these residues
is inhibited by anti-estrogens, there is evidence for an attenuated
response to anti-estrogens, at least for some substitutions.10,14,26
However, it is possible that the observed resistance is reﬂective of
the fact that studies to date have employed ectopic overexpression of the mutant proteins.
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing provides a highly
speciﬁc method for gene deletion and knock-in mutagenesis in
mammalian cells,27 potentially allowing more faithful evaluation of
the functional importance of gene mutations in model systems.

ESR1 Y537S knock-in in breast cancer cells

2287
Thus, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated introduction of mutations in the
genomically encoded ESR1 gene would facilitate direct comparison of isogenic wild-type and mutant breast cancer cells towards
developing a better understanding of the consequences of these
mutations on response to endocrine therapies, and importantly,
would enable evaluation of therapeutic approaches to target
breast cancers featuring ESR1 mutations. Towards this end, we
have targeted Y537, the most frequently mutated ER residue, in
the estrogen-responsive and anti-estrogen-sensitive MCF7 cells. In
MCF7 cells with a genomically encoded ER-Y537S mutation, we
show ligand-independent recruitment of ER and regulation of
gene expression in the absence of estrogen. Moreover, these cells
grow in the absence of estrogen and show evidence of resistance
to anti-estrogens.
Transcription regulation by ER requires cyclical association and
dissociation from regulatory regions of target genes, in a process
that is intimately linked with proteasomal degradation.28,29
Phosphorylation of ER at Ser118 in the N-terminal transactivation
function-1 (AF-1) plays a key role in ER recycling, by promoting
interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP.30 The importance of
Ser118 phosphorylation is underscored by an association between
Ser118 phosphorylation and response to endocrine therapy.31
Moreover, P-Ser118 levels are elevated in tamoxifen-resistant
breast cancer,32 implicating Ser118 phosphorylation in endocrine
resistance. Estrogen binding results in recruitment of the basal
transcription factor TFIIH through a direct interaction with the ER
LBD to promote Ser118 phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK)7 kinase of TFIIH.33,34 We show that CDK7 inhibition is
effective in blocking growth of MCF7 ER-Y537S cells, demonstrating the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 generated breast cancer models of
ER mutations for evaluating new therapeutic approaches for
endocrine resistant breast cancer.
RESULTS
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated generation of MCF7 cells with a
genomically encoded Y537S mutation in the ESR1 gene
Searching a human exon CRISPR database35 identiﬁed four
potential CRISPR sequences that target exon 8 of the ESR1 gene
proximal to the Y537 codon. To identify the most appropriate
CRISPR sequence, we assessed the activities of each CRISPR in the
HCT116 cell line, which has been widely used for creating gene
knockouts. Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA prepared 96 h
after co-transfection of HCT116 cells showed that all four CRISPRs
promoted indels, with CRISPR058819 being apparently the most
efﬁcient (Supplementary Figure 1). This screening approach
provides a rapid method for evaluating CRISPR activity and on
this basis CRISPR058819 was used for generating the Y537S
mutation in MCF7 cells.
Donor DNA for gene targeting consisted of a cloned 1.8 kb
fragment of the ESR1 gene, ﬂanking the Exon 8 coding region.
This was mutated to generate the Y537S mutation (TAT4TCT),
together with a silent, single base change in the L536 codon
(CTG4CTC) and several silent changes to destroy the
CRISPR058819 PAM recognition sequence (Supplementary
Figures 2A and B). The latter substitutions prevent CRISPR targeted
cleavage of the donor template DNA by Cas9, provide a ‘tag’ that
distinguishes targeted from any endogenously generated ESR1
exon 8 mutations and assist with speciﬁc PCR screening for the
MCF7-Y537S mutation.
Following co-transfection of MCF7 cells with the donor
template, CRISPR058819 and hCas9 plasmids, single colony
cloning and PCR screening were used to isolate MCF7 cells with
the ER-Y537S mutation. PCR of genomic DNA prepared from
expanded clones with CRISPR058819 target site mutant-speciﬁc
PCR primers identiﬁed positive clones, which were conﬁrmed with
DNA sequencing. Interestingly, of six clones with successful knock-

in mutations, all but one clone (MCF7-Y537S [NF2-A4]) featured
indels that caused frameshift mutations in the second allele.
Clones with indels were excluded from further analysis because of
the potential for truncated ER proteins. DNA sequencing of the
MCF7-Y537S [NF2-A4] (hereafter referred to as MCF7-Y537S)
genomic DNA was consistent with a heterozygous line with one
mutant allele (Supplementary Figure 2C). Reverse transcriptase
(RT)-PCR of exons 5-8 with a primer that speciﬁcally ampliﬁes the
mutant allele (primer 2) gave a product only for MCF7-Y537S cells
(Figure 1b). The RT-PCR products for primers 1/3 were similar for
both wild-type and MCF7-Y537S RNA. Sanger sequencing of the
latter PCR product showed expression only of wild-type and Y537S
mutant ER in MCF7-Y537S cells (Figure 1c). Note that the smaller
PCR product, which is consistent in size with an alternatively
spliced ER mRNA lacking exon 7 sequences, has been described
previously.7 The exon-7 deleted mRNA is present at similar levels
in both lines, suggesting that introduction of the Y537S mutation
does not alter ER gene expression patterns. Quantiﬁcation of RNAseq reads conﬁrmed that the MCF7-Y537S line expresses only
wild-type and Y537S mutant ER mRNA (Figure 1d). To demonstrate that MCF7-Y537S cells express the mutant protein, ER was
immunoprecipitated and immunoprecipitates were analysed by
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry following tryptic
digestion. A tryptic peptide corresponding to wild-type, but not
mutant ER, was detected in MCF7 cells (Figure 1e, Supplementary
Figure 2D). In MCF7-Y537S cells, both peptides were detected,
with levels of wild-type and mutant peptides being similar in each
replicate. This further conﬁrms similar levels of expression for both
ER proteins in MCF7-Y537S cells.
MCF7-Y537S cells grow in the absence of estrogen and are
partially resistant to anti-estrogens
Whereas MCF7-WT growth was estrogen-dependent, growth of
MCF7-Y537S cells was similar in the presence or absence
of estrogen and comparable to that of estrogen-treated
MCF7-WT cells (Figure 2a). In the absence of estrogen,
4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) inhibited growth of MCF7-Y537S cells in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2b), but complete growth
inhibition was only achieved for 1 μM OHT (3.7-fold). To investigate
the effects of OHT in the presence of estrogen, the cells were treated
with increasing doses of OHT in the presence of 10 nM estrogen.
MCF7 cell growth was inhibited 2.8-fold at 1 μM OHT, this being
comparable to the minimal growth seen in estrogen-depleted
medium. By contrast, even with 1 μM OHT, growth of MCF7-Y537S
growth was only modestly repressed (1.4-fold inhibition).
Faslodex (FAS) was a more effective inhibitor of MCF7-Y537S
growth (Figure 2c). As can be seen, only 1 μM FAS was effective at
inhibiting MCF7-WT cell growth in the presence of 10 nM estrogen,
where it led to a 4.3-fold inhibition of estrogen stimulated growth,
this being comparable to growth for this line in estrogen deprived
medium. MCF7-Y537S cells were similarly growth inhibited by
1 μM FAS in the presence of 10 nM estrogen, this causing a 4.1-fold
inhibition of the growth seen in 10 nM estrogen alone. For MCF7Y537S cells, all concentrations of FAS tested inhibited the potent
growth of this line in the absence of estrogen, with 10 nM-1 μM FAS
leading to a 5.5-6.5-fold inhibition.
In full medium conditions (Figure 2d), MCF7-WT cells showed a
titratable response to OHT, with growth in 1 μM OHT being
inhibited by 1.5-fold over the untreated cells. In contrast, growth
of the MCF7-Y537S line was unaffected by OHT. Under full
medium conditions, MCF7-WT cells also showed potent growth
inhibition by FAS over the range 1 nM-1 μM, with 10 nM–1 μM FAS
resulting in 43-fold inhibition over untreated cells. The response
to FAS by the MCF7-Y537S line under the same conditions was
less pronounced, with 10 nM FAS showing only a 1.2-fold
inhibition, but growth was inhibited fully with 1 μM FAS (2.6-fold
over vehicle-treated cells; Figure 2d).

of the ESR1 gene, exons 5-8, annotated for the positions of PCR primers used for RT-PCR analysis. (b) RT-PCR of MCF7 (WT) and MCF7-Y537S
cell lines using primers in a. Expression of wild-type and mutant ER alleles was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR, using primers in ESR1 Exon 5 (Primer 1,
5′-CCAGGGAAGCTACTGTTTGC-3′) and Exon 8 (Primer 3, 5′-GATGCATGCCGGAGTGTATG-3′), which generate a 700 bp product. The ESR1
transcript arising from the Y537S mutant allele was ampliﬁed as a 466 bp product using the exon 5 primer and the knock-in-speciﬁc primer.
(Primer 2, 5′-TAGTGGGCGCGTGAAGTCTA-3′). (c) Sequencing chromatogram of the RT-PCR products for the exon 8 coding region for MCF7Y537 S cells, showing expression of both mutant and wild-type alleles. (d) Frequency of RNA-seq reads for the Y537 and 537S codons in MCF7
and MCF7-Y537S cells. (e) Normalized intensity of ER tryptic peptide containing amino acid 537 from liquid chromatography mass

obtained for the mutant peptide in MCF7 cells. For the MCF7-Y537S samples, the normalized intensity for each replicate sample is shown by
circles of the same colour, demonstrating similar amounts of the two peptides in MCF7-Y537S cells.

Taken together, these ﬁndings provide evidence that breast
cancer cells harbouring single allele ER-Y537S mutations acquire
both a resistance to anti-estrogens and a capacity to grow
efﬁciently under estrogen-depleted conditions.
ER-Y537S is recruited to ER binding regions in an
estrogen-independent manner to promote co-activator
recruitment and histone modiﬁcation
The above ﬁndings suggest that the ER-Y537S mutation promotes
estrogen-independent expression of ER target genes. Towards
addressing this directly, we performed ER ChIP-seq
(Supplementary Figure 3). Peak calling identiﬁed 5930 and
22 088 ER binding sites in MCF7 cells in the absence and presence
of estrogen, respectively. By contrast, there were 11 092 ER
binding regions in vehicle-treated MCF7-Y537S cells, most of
which were shared with estrogen-treated MCF7-Y537S (88%
(9743/11 092) and MCF7-WT (77% (8510/11 092) cells (Figure 3a).
Additional peaks were called for estrogen-treated MCF7-Y537S
cells, which were also present in estrogen-treated MCF7 cells. A
heat map comparison of ER binding events between the lines
showed that the binding proﬁles in unstimulated Y537S cells are
similar to that seen in estrogen-induced MCF7 cells (Figure 3b), as
demonstrated in plots of average peak proﬁles, which showed a
considerably greater magnitude of ER binding in the absence of
estrogen in MCF7-Y537S, than in WT cells (Figure 3c), as
exempliﬁed for the TFF1 and XBP1 genes (Figure 3c). Motif
enrichment analysis did not suggest that the Y537S mutation
Oncogene (2017) 2286 – 2296

causes ER binding to new sites (Figure 3e; Supplementary Table 2).
In all conditions, the most enriched binding motifs were the ER
binding site (ERE), followed by FOXA1, AP-1 and GATA3
binding sites.
ChIP-qPCR conﬁrmed ER recruitment in an estrogenindependent manner in MCF7-Y537S cells (Figure 3f). Recruitment
of the transcriptional co-activators AIB1 and p300 was also
estrogen-independent (Figures 3g and h). Histone H3 acetylation
and RNA polymerase II (PolII) were also elevated at ER binding
regions in MCF7-Y537S cells in the absence of estrogen (Figures 3i
and j), suggestive of estrogen-independent transcription in this
line. FOXA1 recruitment was unaffected by the Y537S mutation
(Figure 3k), which is in keeping with its described role as a pioneer
factor that pre-exists at ER binding regions and which acts to
direct ER recruitment to chromatin.36
ER target gene expression is ligand-independent and is frequently
enhanced in MCF7-Y537S cells
To determine the consequence of the Y537S mutation on ER
target gene expression, we performed RNA-seq for MCF7 and
MCF7-Y537S cells. Treatment of cells with estrogen for 8 h was
chosen following evaluation of the expression of well-known ER
target genes in a time course of estrogen treatment
(Supplementary Figure 4A). This time point showed robust
stimulation of ER target gene expression in MCF7 cells, but would
be expected to show limited estrogen stimulation of indirect
targets. For each condition, three independent replicate samples

were analysed by RNA-seq. Analysis with the RNASeqPower
package in R for our data showed that three replicates gave a
power 40.8 for a fold change of 1.5. As the sequencing data for
one of the three replicates for MCF7-Y537S cells treated with
estrogen failed quality control, two data sets were available for
analysis. In MCF7 cells, 4873 genes were differentially regulated by
treatment with estrogen (padj o0.05; Figure 4a). Comparison of
vehicle-treated MCF7 and MCF7-Y537S cells showed that the
majority (75%; 3657/4873) of genes that are estrogen-regulated in
MCF7 cells are differentially regulated in MCF7-Y537S cells. Of
these genes, only 31% (1141/3657) are estrogen regulated in
MCF7-Y537S cells (see also supplementary Figure 4B), suggesting
that most estrogen-responsive genes are ligand-independent in
MCF7-Y537S cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identiﬁed
pathways including early and late estrogen responsive targets
(Figure 4b; Supplementary Table 3). Also enriched were pathways
associated with cell proliferation, including E2F and Myc targets
and the G2M checkpoint. Interestingly, several GSEA pathways
enriched with estrogen treatment of MCF7 cells remained
estrogen-regulated in MCF7-Y537S cells. For the most part, these
were pathways that were downregulated in estrogen-treated
MCF7 cells and included protein secretion, heme metabolism and
apoptosis. There was also the suggestion of further augmentation
of ER regulated gene expression in the presence, compared with
the absence of estrogen in MCF7-Y537S cells, which is in
agreement with the estrogen-stimulated ER recruitment observed
for the MCF7-Y537S ER ChIP-seq.
Analysis of the differentially regulated genes using RNASeqPower indicated a fold change cut-off 41.5 was required for
power 40.8. In all, 5407 genes were differentially regulated with
FC41.5 and padj o0.05. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the
differentially regulated genes showed segregation in two large
clusters; genes that showed estrogen stimulation in MCF7 cells
and the expression of which was elevated in MCF7-Y537S cells
and a second group comprising genes whose expression was
reduced in estrogen-treated MCF7 cells and which were further
repressed in MCF7-Y537S cells (Supplementary Figure 4C).

To examine regulation of direct ER target genes, we integrated
the ER ChIP-seq data with the estrogen responsive genes in MCF7
cells (padj o0.05 from RNA-seq, above), using the Binding and
Expression Target Analysis package.37 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq
integration identiﬁed 1559 genes with an ER peak within 100 kb of
transcription start sites. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the RNA-seq
data for these genes identiﬁed four main groups (Figure 4c;
Supplementary Table 4). Cluster 1 comprised genes whose
expression is stimulated by estrogen in MCF7 cells. Expression of
genes in this cluster was elevated in vehicle-treated MCF7-Y537S
cells and was further increased with estrogen treatment. Genes in
this cluster include well-characterized ER target genes, such as
PGR, TFF1, CTSD, GREB1, NRIP1, XBP1, EGR3, CA12, PDZK1, IGFR,
AREG and H19. As many genes are repressed by estrogen in breast
cancer cells, as are stimulated38 and cluster 4 incorporates genes
that are repressed by estrogen in MCF7 cells. Expression of cluster
4 genes was generally lower in MCF7-Y537S cells than in vehicletreated MCF7 cells and was further reduced in estrogen-treated
MCF7-Y537S cells. This is exempliﬁed by ERBB2,39 the expression
of which was 0.8-fold in estrogen treated, compared with vehicletreated MCF7 cells and was reduced to 0.7- and 0.6-fold in vehicleand estrogen-treated MCF7-Y537S (Supplementary Table 4). The
other two clusters include genes whose expression is estrogenstimulated and -repressed in MCF7 cells. Genes in these two
clusters exhibited reduced estrogen responsiveness in MCF7Y537S cells; expression in the absence of estrogen was similar to
expression levels in vehicle-treated MCF7 cells.
Forty per cent of the genes that were differentially regulated
between MCF7 and MCF7-Y537S cells were estrogen regulated in
MCF7 cells and, as described above, are likely to mainly constitute
direct ER target genes. The remaining differential genes may be
involved in signalling pathways downstream of direct ER targets.
To assess this, we analysed RNA-seq data for MCF7 that were
cultured long-term in full medium.40 Most of the genes whose
expression was altered following 8 h estrogen treatment in MCF7
cells were identiﬁed in vehicle-treated MCF7-Y537S and in MCF7
cells cultured in full medium (2884 genes; Supplementary

Figure 4. The Y537S mutation promotes estrogen-independent expression of ER target genes in breast cancer cells. (a) RNA-seq was
performed using three replicate samples of hormone-depleted MCF7 and MCF7-Y537S cells, following addition of vehicle or estrogen for 8 h.
Shown is a Venn diagram comparing differentially regulated genes (padj o0.05) identiﬁed from RNA-seq data. (b) The bar chart shows the
normalized enrichment scores (NES) from Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for ‘Hallmark’ signalling pathways that are signiﬁcantly up- or
downregulated (qo 0.00001) in pair-wise comparisons of the differentially regulated gene sets. (c) Hierarchical cluster analysis of genes that
are differentially regulated in MCF7 cells ± E2 (padjo 0.05) and for which an ER binding site is observed within 100 kb of the transcription
start site. Bar charts show average normalized counts for all genes in the clusters. (d) E2 (1 nM), OHT (10 nM) or FAS (10 nM) were added to
hormone-depleted MCF7 and MCF7-Y537S cells. Shown is RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression using RNA prepared 16 h following addition of
ligands, relative to the vehicle-treated MCF7 cells (n = 3). (e) Immunoblotting was performed using cell lysates prepared 24 h following
addition of ligands.

Figure 5A). Indeed, ‘estrogen response early’ was the most
signiﬁcantly enriched GSEA pathway in this gene set
(Supplementary Figure 5B). Of the remaining genes identiﬁed in
MCF7-Y537S cells, the majority (~70%), are also observed for the
full medium conditions. This set of genes were enriched in

signalling pathways associated with the G2M checkpoint and
mitotic spindle, as well as metabolic pathways including fatty
acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis
(Supplementary Figure 5C). Analysis of an independent RNA-seq
study where MCF7 cells were cultured in estrogen-depleted

medium and treated with estrogen for 24 h41 gave very similar
results (Supplementary Figures 5D-F). Together, these analyses
show that estrogen regulated gene expression is a dominant
feature that deﬁnes the MCF7-Y537S transcriptome.
To validate the RNA-seq ﬁndings, we focused on genes in
cluster 1, as these include many of the best characterized ER
target genes in breast cancer. In hormone-depleted MCF7-Y537S
cells, mRNA levels of these genes were high in the absence of
estrogen, at levels similar to those observed for estrogen-treated
WT cells (Figure 4d). As observed for RNA-seq, expression of most
genes was further stimulated by estrogen in MCF7-Y537S cells, to
levels considerably higher than those achieved in estrogentreated WT cells. Particularly striking is PGR, mRNA levels of which
were 3.3- and 7.6-fold higher in the absence and presence of
estrogen, respectively, compared with PGR expression in
estrogen-treated MCF7 cells. This was reﬂected in the remarkably
elevated levels of both PGR isoforms, PGR-A and PGR-B, in MCF7Y537S cells, compared with WT cells (Figure 4e). In full medium
conditions, expression of these ER targets was also elevated
in MCF7-Y537S mutant, compared with WT MCF7 cells
(Supplementary Figure 6A).
Treatment with 10 nM OHT or FAS inhibited expression of these
genes; nevertheless, expression of most genes was higher than
that in anti-estrogen-treated WT cells. Indeed, whereas expression
of PGR, TFF1 and CTSD was inhibited by as little as 1 nM OHT,
levels of these proteins remained high even in the presence of
1 μM OHT (Supplementary Figure 6B). ER target gene expression
was more responsive to FAS, but as for OHT, levels of all proteins
were higher in the FAS-treated MCF7-Y537S cells than in parental
MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure 6C).
Finally, our results show that ER mRNA levels were similar in
MCF7-WT and MCF7-Y537S cells (Figure 4d). Previous studies have
shown that ER protein levels are reduced upon treatment of MCF7
cells with estrogen, OHT stabilizes ER and FAS promotes ER
degradation (for example, see Wittmann et al.42). In agreement,
ER protein levels were elevated with OHT treatment and
were reduced by FAS treatment in MCF7 cells (Figure 4e,
Supplementary Figures 6B and C). ER levels showed similar ligand
regulation in MCF7-Y537S cells, which suggests that ER binding to
ligands and its stability are not substantially affected by the Y537S
mutation.
CDK7 directed Ser-118 phosphorylation is ligand-independent in
MCF7-Y537S cells
Estrogen binding promotes an interaction between the TFIIH
complex that is mediated by the ER LBD and α-helical LXXLL
motifs in the XPD and p62 subunits of TFIIH, resulting in
Ser118 phosphorylation by the TFIIH kinase CDK7.33 TFIIH coimmunoprecipitated with ER in the presence, but not the absence
of estrogen, as shown by immunoblotting for the XPD subunit of
TFIIH (Figure 5a). In MCF7-Y537S cells, ER interacted with XPD in an
estrogen-independent manner. Moreover, Ser118 phosphorylation
was ligand-dependent in MCF7 cells, but was constitutive in
MCF7-Y537S cells (Figure 4e).
THZ1 is a selective inhibitor of CDK7 that has demonstrable
anti-tumour activities for a wide range of cancer types,43 acting to
inhibit transcription by preventing phosphorylation of the RNA
polymerase II (PolII) C-terminal domain heptapeptide repeats, and
affecting cell cycle progression by inhibiting CDK7-mediated
phosphorylation of CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6.44 THZ1 inhibited
MCF7 cell growth (GI50 = 188 nM) (Figure 5b). MCF7-Y537S cells
were slightly more sensitive to THZ1 (GI50 = 162 nM), albeit with a
difference that was not statistically signiﬁcant. Inhibition of growth
was accompanied by dose-dependent inhibition of PolII CTD
phosphorylation (Figure 5c).
Reasoning that since (a) ER is a transcriptional driver in breast
cancer cells, (b) CDK7 activity is required for transcription and
Oncogene (2017) 2286 – 2296

(c) CDK7 phosphorylates ER at Ser118, we determined if cotreatment with THZ1 and anti-estrogens would provide additional
growth inhibition. THZ1 augmented MCF7-Y537S inhibition by
10 nM FAS (Figure 5d). For 100 nM FAS, MCF7-Y537S growth was
completely suppressed when combined with 75 nM THZ1. PolII
phosphorylation was unaffected by FAS, being inhibited entirely
by THZ1 (Figure 5e). RB phosphorylation was inhibited in a dosedependent manner by FAS and was further inhibited by THZ1 cotreatment (Figure 5f). There was also a dose-dependent inhibition
of Ser118 phosphorylation by FAS and strong inhibition by THZ1
(Figure 5g). Moreover, repression of ER target genes, PGR and
RARA was greatest for the FAS/THZ1 combination. An important
part of the response to THZ1 appears to derive from the special
sensitivity of cancer cells to transcriptional inhibition of key driver
genes, as exempliﬁed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
cells.43 RUNX1, TAL1 and GATA3, which together constitute a
critical transcriptional circuit in T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia cells, were among the genes that were most sensitive
to THZ1. Interestingly, GATA3 was strongly inhibited by THZ1 in
MCF7 and MCF7-Y537S cells. As a pioneer factor for ER in breast
cancer cells,45 the potent inhibition of GATA3 expression by CDK7
inhibitors provides further evidence for its potential utility in the
treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.
DISCUSSION
Mutations in the ER gene have recently been found to be common
in advanced breast cancer and are likely to represent an important
mechanism of endocrine resistance. Understanding the impact of
these mutations on ER signalling in breast cancer cells is a crucial
step towards identifying therapeutic interventions following
emergence of ER mutations. Although tumour explants and
patient-derived xenografts will be important for testing alternative
therapies, modelling them in established, well-characterized
breast cancer cell lines should facilitate rapid and intensive
evaluation. By facilitating the generation of isogenic lines with
mutations of interest encoded within endogenous genes, the
application of CRISPR-Cas9 methodologies for gene replacement
promises a powerful new tool for bypassing problems inherent in
over-expression studies. With this in mind, we replaced tyrosine
537 in the endogenous ER gene of MCF7 estrogen responsive
breast cancer cells, to make serine 537, one of the most common
ER mutations in advanced, metastatic breast cancer.
Sequencing of genomic DNA, RNA-seq and quantitative massspectrometry demonstrated that MCF7-Y537S cells encode one
copy of the mutant allele and express wild-type and Y537S ER
proteins at equivalent levels, as is likely in metastatic breast
cancer. This was sufﬁcient to drive estrogen-independent growth,
indicating that the Y537S mutation is dominant. Recently, Fanning
et al.19 have reported detailed ligand binding properties of the
Y537S LBD. Using a radioligand binding assay, they found that the
afﬁnity of E2 for the wild-type LBD is ﬁve-fold greater than that
seen for the Y537S LBD. Further, while X-ray crystallography
analysis of the apo- and agonist-bound states of the Y537S LBD
show near identical helix 12 conformations, equating to a stable
agonist state in the absence of E2, time-resolved Forster
Resonance Energy Transfer (tr-FRET) measurements of coactivator binding show that E2 results in an increase in
co-activator afﬁnity in the Y537S LBD. Indeed, this behaviour is
likely to be an important factor in both the E2 response of
MCF7-Y537S cells, when comparing the expression of estrogen
regulated genes between mutant and wild-type cells, and the
mechanisms underlying the resistance to antiestrogens exhibited
by MCF7-Y537S cells.
MCF7-Y537S cells were found to be resistant to both tamoxifen
and the ER downregulator faslodex, although resistance to
faslodex was less pronounced. In estrogen-free conditions,
MCF7-Y537S cells were strongly inhibited by 1 and 10 nM FAS.

Figure 5. Inhibition of MCF7-Y537S growth by the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 in combination with anti-estrogens. (a) TFIIH interacts in an estrogenindependent manner with ER in MCF7-Y537S cells. Protein lysates from hormone-depleted MCF7 and MCF7-Y537S cells treated with estrogen
(10 nM) for 3 h were immunoprecipitated with an antibody for ER, or with mouse immunoglobulins (IgG; control). Immunoprecipitates were
immunoblotted with antibodies for the XPD subunit of TFIIH, the ER co-activator AIB1 and a control protein (Lamin A/C). (b) Cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of THZ1 for 48 h. Mean growth is shown relative to that for vehicle (dimethylsulphoxide-treated cells) (n = 6).
GI50 = concentration of THZ1 at which cell growth is inhibited by 50%. (c) Protein lysates prepared from cells treated with increasing
concentrations of THZ1 for 4 h were immunoblotted for PolII and for phosphorylation of Ser2, Ser5 and Ser7 in the PolII C-terminal domain
heptapeptide repeat. (d) Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS over a 12-day period in the presence of 10 or 100 nM FAS, together
with 20, 50, 75 or 100 nM THZ1. Growth was assessed using the SRB assay and is shown relative to SRB values at day 0. The bars represent
mean values ± s.e.m. for six replicates. (e–g) Immunoblotting was performed with protein lysates prepared 24 h after addition of
FAS ± 75 nM THZ1.

However, if estrogen was present, potent growth inhibition
required 100 nM FAS. It should be noted that peak (Cmax) plasma
concentrations in patients following high dose administration of
faslodex (500 mg), average at about 20 ng/ml (approximately
30 nM),46,47 suggesting that only partial inhibition of ER signalling
may be achievable with faslodex in patients with the Y537S
mutation.
Using a competitive radioligand-binding assay to determine the
relative binding afﬁnities of OHT for WT and Y537S mutant LBDs,
Fanning et al19 found that binding to the mutant LBD was 8-10fold weaker than to the WT. Further, expression of Y537S mutated
ER in the ER-positive T47D breast cancer cell line has shown that
FAS can downregulate endogenous WT and transfected mutant
ER protein, and could partially suppress growth of the mutantexpressing cells. Both the greatly reduced binding afﬁnity of ERY537S to OHT, and the continued sensitivity of the mutant
receptor to FAS, are consistent with the response that our MCF7-

Y537S cells exhibit to anti-estrogens. It is possible that new
selective ER modulators, such as the orally bioavailable AZD9496,
GDC-0810 and RAD1901, could improve on patient responses,
since they may not be subject to the dose limitations due to the
poor pharmaceutical properties of faslodex.48–50 Additionally, we
have now shown that it may be possible to achieve CDK7 inhibitor
promoted growth inhibition using clinically achievable
faslodex doses.
Of the group of ER LBD coding mutations featured in breast
cancer, mutations of tyrosine 537 are among the most prevalent,
with the Y537S mutation being the most frequent of these. It is
well established that tyrosine 537 is the major tyrosine
phosphorylation site in ER, where it is involved in receptor
dimerization and DNA binding.51,52 Furthermore, it has been
shown that the Y537S mutated receptor also dimerizes
effectively.53 Intriguingly, recent studies employing a chemical
semi-synthesis strategy to prepare site speciﬁc in vitro
Oncogene (2017) 2286 – 2296

ESR1 Y537S knock-in in breast cancer cells
A Harrod et al

2294
phosphorylated ER LBDs have shown that tyrosine 537 phosphorylation results in a ligand-independent increase in coactivator
binding.54 The activity of the Y537S ER mutation in this context
similarly needs to be studied in detail, so that a better
understanding of this mutation in metastatic breast cancer can
be achieved. Clearly, the genome engineered MCF7-Y537S line
described in our study provides an appropriate cellular model in
which the ﬁndings from such studies can be evaluated and,
perhaps more importantly, could be further used to develop new
therapeutic strategies for metastatic breast cancer featuring Y537S
ER mutations.
Mapping global ER binding showed that the Y537S mutation
promotes estrogen-independent ER recruitment. Furthermore,
recruitment of co-activators including AIB1 and p300, as well as
PolII, was increased in the absence of estrogen. ER, co-activator
and PolII recruitment were stimulated by estrogen, presumably
due to co-expression with wild-type ER and/or estrogen stimulation of ER-Y537S activity. The majority (63%) of genes whose
expression was stimulated by estrogen in MCF7 cells were
upregulated in MCF7-Y537S cells in the absence of estrogen.
Expression of these genes was stimulated further by estrogen.
Estrogen treatment of MCF7 cells represses expression of as many,
or more, genes than are stimulated.38 Integration of ER ChIP-seq
and RNA-seq data identiﬁed 1559 estrogen-regulated genes in
MCF7 cells, of which 52% were repressed by estrogen. Interestingly, the majority (65%) of these genes were repressed in MCF7Y537S cells in the absence of estrogen and were further repressed
by estrogen. These analyses indicate that the Y537S mutation
does not reprogramme ER by causing genomic redistribution of
ER or expression of new target genes, conﬁrmed by the fact that
GSEA analysis did not provide evidence for new signalling
pathways.
The considerable over-expression, or ‘super-induction’ of the
majority of estrogen-induced genes, is extremely interesting and
deserves further investigation. As expression of many transcription
factors that co-operate with ER, such as RARA, PGR, LRH-1 and
c-myc, as well as many transcriptional co-regulators, including
AIB1, NRIP1, is stimulated by ER activation, estrogen-independent
expression of these factors might be important for promoting
chromatin remodelling and enhanced transcription at ER target
genes. Gene expression at ER target genes requires the coordinated and cyclical recruitment and dissociation of ER and coregulators at ER target genes.28 Ligand-independent recruitment
of ER, and upregulation of ER-regulated transcription factors and
co-regulators might alter the kinetics of chromatin remodelling,
towards greater gene transcription. Also unexpected was the
ﬁnding that the expression of many ER target genes was not
ligand-independent, and indeed expression of many ER target
genes, as evidenced by genes in clusters 2 and 3, was blunted in
MCF7-Y537S cells. At present we can only speculate that these
classes of genes involve co-operativity of ER with additional/
alternative factors that are themselves estrogen regulated.
Determination of ER and co-factor recruitment and chromatin
modiﬁcation/remodelling in time course studies of genes
representative of the different categories, as well as proteomic
approaches for identifying factors recruited to ER binding regions
in MCF7 and MCF7-Y537S cells would help to more clearly deﬁne
the mechanisms at work.
Notwithstanding, our results raise the possibility that tumours
with ER mutations might be especially sensitive to drugs that
target the activities of super-induced genes. Examples of strongly
over-expressed genes identiﬁed by our analyses include RARA and
PGR, for which agonists/antagonist drugs are available and both of
which are key regulators of ER action in breast cancer.55–57 MCF7Y537S cells provide an important vehicle for testing these and
other therapeutic strategies, for example with genome-wide or
targeted siRNA screening, or screening of drug libraries. Our
results for the CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 exemplify such approaches for

evaluation of new therapies that could be used singly, or in
combination with endocrine therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and growth assays
MCF7-luc and MCF7-Y537S cells were authenticated by LGC Standards
(Bury, UK) as being MCF7 derived and were routinely checked, and found
to be negative, for mycoplasma infection. Cell lines were routinely cultured
in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS). For estrogen depletion experiments, the cells were transferred
to DMEM lacking phenol red and containing 5% dextran-coated charcoalstripped FCS (DSS) for 72 h. 17ß-estradiol (E2), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT)
and Faslodex (FAS) (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) were prepared in ethanol.
THZ1 (ApexBio, Houston, TX, USA) was dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide.
Cell growth was assessed using the sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay.58
Brieﬂy, 4000 cells per well were seeded as six well technical replicates in
96-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% DSS. Sixteen hours later,
the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with E2, antiestrogens, or an equivalent volume of the vehicle (ethanol). Medium was
changed every 3 days and growth statistically analysed, so as to show
average growth, with error bars for the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.).
Each growth experiment was independently conﬁrmed using three
biological replicates.

CRISPR-Cas9-mediated generation of the MCF7-Y537S cell line
The ESR1 Y537S mutation was generated in MCF7-luc cells (Cell Biolabs Inc,
San Diego, CA, USA) using CRISPR058819 (5′-GGCTAGTGGGCGCATGTAGG
-3′), identiﬁed from the Human exon speciﬁc CRISPR database (http://arep.
med.harvard.edu/human_crispr) and cloned into a guide-RNA expression
plasmid (a gift from George Church; Addgene #41824), as described.35 For
homologous recombination, a 1803 bp fragment of the ESR1 gene ﬂanking
the Exon 8 coding region was ampliﬁed using the primers
5′-GGAAGAGCTTGGAGACATGG-3′ and 5′-AGGGCTAAATGCAACACCAG-3′,
from MCF7-luc genomic DNA and cloned into pJET1.2/blunt (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Loughborough, UK). This ESR1 gene targeting template was
modiﬁed by site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate a coding change for
the Y537S mutation (TAT4TCT) and a silent ‘tagging’ change at the codon
for residue L536 (CTG4CTC). Site-directed mutagenesis generated
additional silent mutations spanning the codons for residues 547-550, to
prevent CRISPR058819-Cas9-mediated cleavage of the donor DNA. These
changes also enable speciﬁc detection of Exon 8 targeted DNA by PCR with
the mutation speciﬁc primer 5′-TAGTGGGCGCGTGAAGTCTA-3′ and a
second primer, 5′-AAAATCAGTGTGGCTCCGGA-3′, so as to generate a
712 bp knock-in-speciﬁc PCR product, originating in genomic DNA 42nt
upstream of the 5′ end of the donor DNA.
ESR1 Exon 8 gene targeting plasmid, CRISPR058819 expression plasmid
and the hCas9 expression plasmid (a gift from George Church; Addgene
plasmid #41815) were co-transfected into MCF7-luc cells using an Amaxa
Type II nucleofector (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). Following nucleofection,
cells were allowed to grow in hormone-depleted culture medium, and
established colonies subsequently expanded in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Colonies were screened with the knock-inspeciﬁc PCR and subsequently further characterized by DNA sequencing
of a 462 bp PCR product generated using primers with the sequences
5′-CCAGCTCCCATCCTAAAGTG-3′ and 5′-TTGGCTAAAGTGGTGCATGA-3′, which
amplify the coding region of Exon 8.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations
Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich),
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche,
West Sussex, UK), as described.59 Immunoblotting was performed for two
biological replicates, using 20 μg protein lysate. Immunoprecipitations for
two biological replicates were carried out as described.60 Antibodies are
detailed in Supplementary Table 1.

Liquid chromatography Mass Spectrometry
Following immunoprecipitation of ER from MCF7 and MCF7-Y537S cells, ER
on the beads was incubated overnight at 37 °C with trypsin in 1 M urea, in a
total volume of 20 μl. After addition of 5 μl of 20% formic acid, spectra
were generated by collision-induced dissociation of tryptic digests in the
linear ion trap of the LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument.

RNA preparation, quantitative RT-PCR and RNA-seq
Total RNA from three biological replicate cultures for each condition was
extracted as previously described,61 with DNase treatment to remove
genomic DNA. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out using three
technical replicates for each sample for Taqman Gene Expression Assays
(Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA), as listed in Supplementary Table
1 and presented as mean fold difference to the control, with error bars for
s.e.m. RNA-seq was performed as described.40

Chromatin immunoprecipitations and Solexa sequencing
(ChIP-seq)
MCF7 and Y537S cells were cultured in hormone-depleted medium for
72 h. Chromatin was prepared from two biological replicates 45 min
after addition of 10 nM estrogen and ChIP assays were performed as
described60 using three technical replicates and the results compared
using the unpaired t-test method. ChIP-seq was carried out on a
single replicate for each treatment, using methods that have been
described.60

Bioinformatic analyses
ChIP-seq analysis was as described.60 RNA-seq data were analysed as
described.40 In brief, paired-end 100 bp reads, generated on an Illumina
Hiseq 2500, were aligned using TopHat 2.0.14 and aligned reads were
counted by HTSeq 0.6.1. The R package ‘DESeq2’ was used to normalize
counts using a regularized log transformation (rlog).62 Shrunken log2 fold
changes were also calculated to determine differentially expressed genes
between conditions, while minimizing the fold change variation of low
expression genes. Heat maps were generated in R using ‘gplots’ with rlog
transformed read counts of differentially expressed genes. GSEA analysis
was performed with the Molecular Signatures Database ‘Hallmarks’ gene
set collection.63
The Binding and Expression Target Analysis package37 was used for
integrating Chip-seq and RNA-seq data. To identify direct ER target genes,
the Binding and Expression Target Analysis basic was run with a modiﬁed
setting (look for peak within 100 kb from gene transcription start site).
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data have been deposited with the NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession
number GSE78286.
