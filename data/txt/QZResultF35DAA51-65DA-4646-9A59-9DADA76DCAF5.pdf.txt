Summary

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

After DNA replication, chromosomal processes including DNA repair and transcription take place
in the context of sister chromatids. While cell cycle regulation can guide these processes globally,
mechanisms to distinguish pre- and post-replicative states locally remain unknown. Here, we
reveal that new histones incorporated during DNA replication provide a signature of postreplicative chromatin, read by the TONSL–MMS22L1–4 homologous recombination (HR)
complex. We identify the TONSL Ankyrin Repeat Domain (ARD) as a reader of histone H4 tails
unmethylated at K20 (H4K20me0), which are specific to new histones incorporated during DNA
replication and mark post-replicative chromatin until G2/M. Accordingly, TONSL–MMS22L
binds new histones H3–H4 both prior to and after incorporation into nucleosomes, remaining on
replicated chromatin until late G2/M. H4K20me0 recognition is required for TONSL–MMS22L
binding to chromatin and accumulation at challenged replication forks and DNA lesions.
Consequently, TONSL ARD mutants are toxic, compromising genome stability, cell viability and

The TONSL–MMS22L complex is an obligate heterodimer required for replication fork
stability and repair of replication-associated DNA damage by aiding Rad51 loading1–4.
TONSL–MMS22L associates with soluble non-nucleosomal histones H3–H41,5, the histone
chaperone ASF11–4 and MCM2/4/6/71–5 in a manner that depends on the TONSL ankyrin
repeat domain (ARD)1. We have found that histones H3–H4 bridge the interactions between
TONSL–MMS22L and ASF11, between ASF1 and MCM26,7, and between TONSL–
MMS22L and MCM2 (Extended Data Fig. 1a), suggesting simultaneous binding of these
proteins to histones H3–H4 in a large pre-deposition complex. In addition, TONSL–
MMS22L interacts with nucleosomal histones in chromatin (Extended Data Fig. 1b). This
suggests that TONSL–MMS22L functions as an H3–H4 histone chaperone whilst also
acting as a histone reader in chromatin. Consistent with the first, TONSL was recently
shown to have histone chaperone activity in vitro5. We therefore set out to explore the
mechanism of action of TONSL–MMS22L by a structure-function approach.

Full length TONSL and the ARD alone bound directly to histones H3–H4 but not H2A–H2B
in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 1c-f). As our attempts to crystallize the ARD with H3–H4 were
not successful, we linked the ARD to the MCM2 histone-binding domain (HBD), because a
similar design previously enabled us to solve the structure of an H3–H4 dimer in complex
with MCM2 and ASF17. We obtained crystals of covalently linked MCM2 HBD–G4–
TONSL ARD in complex with H3 (57–135) and H4 that diffracted to 2.43 Å resolution, and
solved the structure by molecular replacement based on our structure of MCM2 HBD in
complex with an H3–H4 tetramer7 (Fig. 1a, b; X-ray statistics in Extended Data Table 1).
The structure shows a pair of MCM2 HBDs wrapped around the lateral surface of the H3–
H4 tetramer similar to the MCM2 HBD–H3–H4 complex alone7,8, while two TONSL
ARDs interact with each of the H4 tails (Fig. 1a, b). The G4-linker along with flanking
residues formed a 19-residues long disordered segment that could reach a distance of up to
70 Å. The distance from the observed C-terminus of MCM2 HBD to the observed Nterminus of TONSL ARD is only 10 Å, arguing that the covalent linkage within the MCM2
HBD–G4–TONSL ARD cassette does not impact on the structural integrity of the complex.
TONSL ARD forms no intermolecular interactions with the MCM2 HBD, consistent with
H3–H4 bridging the interaction of TONSL and MCM2 in cells (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and
it shows only minimal contacts with the core of the H3–H4 tetramer (Fig. 1a, b). However,
the TONSL ARD forms extensive contacts with a segment of the H4 tail (Fig. 1b, c,
Extended Data Fig. 1g) and, consistently, it binds the GST-H4 tail, but not the GST-H3 tail,
in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In addition to defining TONSL binding to soluble histone
H3–H4 in complex with MCM2 (Fig. 1a, b), this binding-mode is also compatible with
TONSL binding histone H3–H4 dimers in a co-chaperone complex with MCM2 and ASF17
as well as recognizing H4 tails in a nucleosome (see models in Extended Data Fig. 2b, c).
The TONSL ARD consists of four ankyrin repeats, three of which adopt the canonical fold
(ANK1-3), while the remaining one is an atypical and capping repeat (ANK4) (Extended

Data Fig. 1g). The TONSL ARD uses its elongated concave surface to form extensive
contacts with the H4 tail in an extended β-strand like conformation (Extended Data Fig. 1g,
Fig. 1c). Notably, 15 out of 18 residues that constitute the H4 tail-binding surface of TONSL
ARD are highly conserved (Extended Data Fig. 2d). The TONSL ARD targets the H4 tail
spanning residues Lys12 to Arg23 (Fig. 1c-g, Extended Data Fig. 3a, b) with three
consecutive binding channels accommodating Arg17, His18 and Lys20 (Fig. 1d). These H4
residues are part of a basic region, which can interact with the acidic patch on neighbor
nucleosomes9 in compact chromatin. H4 Arg17 forms two hydrogen bonds with ARD
Asn571 and stacks with Tyr572 and Cys608 (Fig. 1c, e), while H4 His18 penetrates into a
pocket lined by four strictly conserved residues (Trp563, Glu568, Asn571 and Asp604) (Fig.
1c, f). Substitution of H4 His18 with the larger Trp residue (mutant H18W) disrupts binding
with ARD (Fig. 2a), underscoring the importance of fitting His18 in the pocket. The H4
Lys20 residue is bound within an acidic surface channel on ARD (Fig. 1c, d). The side-chain
of H4 Lys20 interacts with Met528 and contacts the edge of Trp563 of ARD, while the
main-chain atoms of H4 Lys20 packs against Cys561 of ARD (Fig. 1g). The Nζ atom of H4
Lys20 forms three strong hydrogen bonds (distance < 3 Å) with the side-chains of strictly
conserved residues Glu530, Asp559 and Glu568 of ARD, which engage H4 Lys20 in a
triangular arrangement (Fig. 1g). Consistent with the structural data, histone H4 mutations
R17A, H18A, and K20A disrupted binding to TONSL in cells (Fig. 1h). Likewise, mutation
of 6 conserved TONSL residues lining the H4 Arg17, His18 and Lys20 binding channels
disrupted binding to H4 peptides and recombinant histone H3–H4 (Fig. 1i, Extended Data
Fig. 3c). In vivo, these mutants abrogated binding to soluble histone H3–H4 and,
consequentially, also association with ASF1 (a and b) and MCM2 without affecting
MMS22L binding to TONSL1,2 (Fig. 1j; Extended Data Fig. 3d). These mutations did not
affect ARD structure, as indicated by Circular Dichroism (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Together,
this defines TONSL ARD as a recognition module for histone H4 tails, distinct from the
GLP/G9A ARDs that binds histone H3 tails mono or dimethylated at K910 (Extended Data
Fig. 4a, b).
The structure predicts that methylation on H4K20 should break critical hydrogen bonds with
the TONSL ARD. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and H4 tail peptide pull-downs
confirmed that H4K20me1/2 is incompatible with TONSL binding (Fig. 2a-c). Further,
H4K20me2 significantly reduced binding of full-length recombinant TONSL–MMS22L to
reconstituted mono-nucleosomes (Fig. 2d). Recently, TONSL ARD with its neighboring
acidic stretch was proposed to bind H3K9me15, but we were unable to detect an interaction
between TONSL ARD (with or without the acidic stretch) and H3K9me1 peptides
(Extended Data Fig. 4c, d). Together, our data show that TONSL binds to both free histones
and nucleosomes via ARD recognition of H4 tails unmodified at K20 (Fig. 1a-j, Fig. 2a-e,
Extended Data Fig. 1b, 2a-c, 3a-d). In line with this, H4K20me2 was not detected on
TONSL-bound nucleosomal histones (Fig. 2f), while H4K16ac was present (Extended Data
Fig. 5a). H4K16ac stimulated TONSL binding in peptide pull-downs (Fig. 2b, c, Extended
Data Fig. 5b) and slightly enhanced ARD binding in ITC (Fig. 2a), but it did not overturn
the inhibitory effect of H4K20me2 (Fig. 2e). However, H4K16ac is not essential for TONSL
binding in vivo, as soluble histone H4 does not carry H4K16ac11 and depletion of MOF, the
major H4K16 acetyltransferase12, did not significantly affect TONSL binding to chromatin

(Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). In contrast, depletion of the H4K20 methyltransferase PR-SET7/
SET8 significantly enhanced TONSL binding to chromatin in G1 cells where H4K20me2
peaks13–16 (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 5e, f). We conclude that TONSL ARD is a histone
reader domain specific for H4 tails unmethylated at K20.

Given that TONSL–MMS22L binds new histones (devoid of H4K20me11,17) in a predeposition complex with ASF1 and MCM21 (Fig. 1j, Extended Data Fig. 1a), TONSL–
MMS22L could be loaded onto replicating DNA together with new histones. To test how
long after deposition new histones remain unmethylated at H4K20 with the potential to bind
TONSL, we extracted H4K20 data from our recent large-scale proteomic study18 tracking
modifications on new and old recycled histones by Nascent Chromatin Capture (NCC)19
(Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). In nascent chromatin, new histones were exclusively
unmethylated at H4K20 (98% H4K20me0), while old recycled histones were almost fully
methylated at H4K20 (me1, 7%; me2, 88%; me3, 2%). Consistent with previous work13–
16, our analysis of primary cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c) and degradation of PR-SET7/SET8
in S phase15,16, new histones became methylated in late G2/M, rendering G1 chromatin
devoid of H4K20me0 (Fig. 3a). This identifies H4K20me0 on new histones as a signature of
post-replicative chromatin, implying that TONSL–MMS22L can bind H4 tails on new
histones at replication forks and sister chromatids until late G2/M. Confirming this
prediction, TONSL accumulated on chromatin in S phase, remained chromatin-bound in a
population of G2 cells and was excluded from chromatin in G1 (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig.
6d-f). To discriminate pre- and post-replicative chromatin, we labeled replicating DNA with
EdU (pulse to mark ongoing replication, continuous labeling to identify post-replicative
chromatin) and stained pre-replicative chromatin with MCM220,21, and analyzed colocalization with TONSL. TONSL staining was mutually exclusive with MCM2 (Fig. 3c,
Extended Data Fig. 7a), but co-localized with EdU pulse labeling in very early S phase and
with replicated DNA (continuous EdU labeling) throughout S phase (Fig. 3d, Extended Data
Fig. 7b, c). TONSL was present at sites of ongoing DNA replication throughout S phase, but
the degree of co-localization declined in mid/late S (Fig. 3d, left panel), consistent with
TONSL binding to post-replicative chromatin also after fork passage (Fig. 3d, right panel).
Mutation of the TONSL ARD abrogated recruitment of TONSL to chromatin, including
DNA replication sites (Fig. 3e, f, Extended Data Fig. 7d-g). Together, this demonstrates that
TONSL is recruited to replication forks and post-replicative chromatin via ARD recognition
of H4K20me0 on new histones.
Mutation of TONSL ARD also abrogated chromatin binding and recruitment to replication
forks in the presence of replication poisons like camptothecin (CPT) and hydroxyurea (HU)
(Fig. 4a-c). Furthermore, ARD mutation prevented accumulation of TONSL at site-specific
DSBs (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 8a) and microlaser-generated DNA damage (Fig. 4e,
Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). Co-staining with cell cycle markers confirmed that TONSL is
recruited to DNA repair sites only in S and G2 cells as expected2 (Fig. 4e, Extended Data
Fig. 8d, e). We conclude that H4K20me0 binding is required for TONSL accumulation at
damaged forks and DNA lesions in post-replicative chromatin. However, this was not due to
increased H4K20me0 (Extended Data Fig. 8f), suggesting that unmasking of H4 tails upon
chromatin decompaction9,22 and/or interaction with repair factors contribute to TONSL–
MMS22L accumulation at repair sites. Consistent with the latter, MMS22L interaction with

Rad51 can stabilize the complex at challenged forks (P. Cejka and M. Peter, personal
communication). Our data argue that this is subsequent to H4K20me0 binding (Fig. 4a-e),
and we thus next addressed the contribution of H4K20me0 recognition to TONSL–
MMS22L function. In complementation analysis, TONSL WT partially rescued viability of
TONSL depleted cells in the presence and absence of CPT (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 8g,
h), whereas TONSL ARD mutants were highly toxic (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 8g, h). In
control cells, TONSL ARD mutants also reduced viability, causing G2/M arrest
accompanied by replication-associated DNA damage (Fig. 4g, h). Further, TONSL ARD
mutants titrated MMS22L away from chromatin (Fig. 4i, Extended Data Fig. 8i), explaining
the dominant negative phenotype that mimics TONSL–MMS22L depletion1–4. Collectively,
this indicates that recognition of H4K20me0 is central to TONSL-MMS22L function in
safeguarding genome stability.

This study reveals that post-replicative chromatin has a distinct histone modification
signature, read by the TONSL–MMS22L effector protein (Fig. 4j). This opens a new avenue
to understand how DNA repair and other chromosomal transactions can be directly linked to
the replication state of a genomic locus. Intriguingly, it is the new histones that make postreplicative chromatin distinct, and in this way H4K20me0 resembles the behavior of
H3K56ac23 in yeast. Our data argues that TONSL–MMS22L is delivered to nascent
chromatin with new histones via the pre-deposition complex with MCM2 and ASF1 (Fig.
4j). We favor the idea that TONSL has a dual function as a histone chaperone5 and histone
reader. Our structural work proposes that TONSL acts in a histone chaperone-like capacity
by sequestering the H4 tail to prevent spurious contacts with DNA during H3-H4 deposition.
Further, TONSL ARD may counteract chromatin compaction by preventing association of
the H4 tail with the H2A–H2B acidic patch on neighboring nucleosomes. Thus, TONSL
changes our perception of a histone chaperone by binding both soluble and nucleosomal
histones. In its function as a histone reader, TONSL localizes MMS22L to post-replicative
chromatin via H4K20me0 and allows TONSL–MMS22L to accumulate at damaged forks
and DNA lesions. We envision that H4K20me0 works as an affinity trap, making TONSL–
MMS22L readily available to support Rad51 loading during HR. This provides a new
approach and opportunity to understand the role of H4K20 in DNA repair, complementing
the well-described role of H4K20me1/2 in recruiting 53BP124 to promote NHEJ in
competition with BRCA1-BARD125. In post-replicative chromatin, H4K20me1/2 on old
histones will support 53BP1 recruitment. Whether H4K20me0 on new histones also
influences DNA repair pathway choice will be of interest to future investigations. It is
notable that the structure of the TONSL ARD, including the histone-binding surface, is
highly similar to the ARD of BARD126 (Extended Data Fig. 9a), required for BRCA1
tumor suppressor function and HR27. Multiple mutations in the TONSL ARD are reported
in cancer (C608G, COSM4879909; P557S, COSM4565032; E597K, COSM3382163) and
the N571 residue, key to histone H4 binding, corresponds to the BARD1 N470S cancer
mutation26,28. This underscores that the tumor suppressor function of H4K20me0
recognition and the possibilities it brings for targeted cancer therapy should be explored in
the future.

All proteins used in this study, unless otherwise indicated, were expressed in BL21(DE3)RIL cell strain (Stratagene). The human TONSL Ankyrin Repeat Domain (ARD, residues
512–692) and MCM2 Histone-binding Domain (HBD, fragments 61–130) were covalently
linked through a four-Glycine linker (G4 linker) into one expression cassette. The MCM2
HBD–G4–TONSL ARD expression cassette was cloned into a modified RSFDuet-1 vector
(Novagen), with an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag. The resulting plasmid was coexpressed
with plasmid harbouring histone genes H3.3(Δ56) and H4. The expressed protein complex
was first purified on Ni-NTA affinity column. After removing the His6-SUMO tag by using
Ulp1 (SUMO protease), the protein complex was further purified on HiLoad 16/600
Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare).
The GST-tagged TONSL ARD and its mutants including E530A, D559A, W563A, E568A,
N571A and D604A were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare). The expressed
proteins were first purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B, then further purified by gelfiltration step. In some case, the GST-tag was removed with 3C protease before gel-filtration
step. For purification of GST-H3 tail and GST-H4 tail proteins, the human histones H3
fragment 1–59 and H4 fragment 1–31 were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector respectively. The
proteins were expressed and purified in the same way.

For production of recombinant full-length TONSL-MMS22L heterodimer, the sequence
coding for full-length MMS22L was fused with a MBP tag at the 5’ end and 10×His tag at
the 3’ end. The sequence coding for full-length TONSL was fused with GST tag at the 5’
end. Both MMS22L and TONSL constructs were cloned into a pFastBac1 vector. The
complex was expressed in Sf9 cells by co-infection with both recombinant baculoviruses
according to manufacturer’s recommendation (Invitrogen). The proteins were extracted from
Sf9 cells and purified similarly as described previously for Sgs130. Briefly, the complex was
purified on amylose resin, and MBP and GST tags were subsequently cleaved with
PreScission protease. The heterodimer was then further purified using a Ni-NTA affinity
resin. Washes were performed with 300 mM NaCl buffer.
Crystallization
At first, we tried to crystallize TONSL ARD in complex with a H4 tail or H3–H4 tetramer,
but failed even with extensive screening. Additional binding protein may help to stabilize the
whole complex and help for crystallization. Then we tried to crystallize TONSL ARD in
complex with the MCM2 HBD and H3–H4 tetramer. We just got very tiny crystals for this
complex, but failed to get big and well diffracted crystals. We realized that the whole
complex of TONSL ARD with MCM2 HBD and H3–H4 tetramer might be destabilized by
the harsh crystallization conditions and form subcomplex, thus hindered the optimization of
the crystals. Then we tried to covalently link TONSL ARD and MCM2 HBD into one
cassette through different length of Glycine linker (Gx linker). The G12, G11, G10, G9, G8,
G7, G6, G5 and G4 linkers had been tried and all these cassettes could be crystallized. One of
the constructs with a G4 linker gave well-diffracted crystals.

Recombinant human histone proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL cells from
pET21b(+) (Novagen) vectors and purified by denaturing gel filtration and ion exchange
chromatography essentially as described34. All histone proteins were dialysed into water
containing 1mM DTT, lyophilised and stored dry at -80°C. Modified H4 proteins were
generated by native chemical ligation essentially as described for H335. Briefly, tail-less H4
Δ1-28 I29C protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL cells from pET24b(+)

using a ResourceRPC column (GE Healthcare). Purified H4 Δ1-28 I29C was then ligated to
N-terminally acetylated H4 1-28 thioester peptides (Almac) and full length ligated H4 was
separated from unligated H4 Δ1-28 I29C by reversed phase chromatography via a C18
column (Aquapore RP-300/Perkin Elmer) using a gradient from 35% B to 45% B over 20
column volumes (A: 0.1%TFA in water, B: 90% acetonitrile; 0.1% TFA). Ligated H4 was
directly lyophilised and stored dry at -80°C. Ligated H4 was refolded into octamers together
with purified histones H2A, H2B and H3.1 and then assembled into nucleosomes with
biotinylated 601-DNA as described34,35.
GST pull-downs
For pull-downs of GST-ARD and its mutants including E530A, D559A, W563A, E568A,
N571A and D604A with H3–H4, first 25 μL of Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads were
suspended with 200 μL of binding buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 0.5 M NaCl), and 1 nmol
of GST-ARD proteins were added and incubated at 23 °C for 10 minutes (min); then 0.5
nmol of pre-purified H3/H4 tetramers were added and incubated for another 1 hour; then the
beads were washed quickly with five times 1 mL of washing buffer (binding buffer, 1%
Triton X-100) before adding 50 µL of sample loading buffer. An aliquot of 20 μL of each
sample was analysed with SDS-PAGE. The GST pull-downs of histone tails of GST-H31-59

Lys16), H18W (with His18 mutated to Trp18), H4K20me1 (mono-methylation on Lys20)
and H4K20me2 (di-methylation on Lys20), and peptide of H3(1-21)K9me1 (monomethylation on Lys9) were all synthesized at Tufts University Core Facility The exothermic
heat of the reaction was measured by 17 sequential 2.2 μl injections of the peptides (1.41
mM in buffer 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 0.5 M NaCl) into 200 μl of the TONSL ARD solution
(145 μM in the same buffer), spaced at intervals of 150 s or 180s. The data were processed
with Microcal Origin software and the curves were fit to a single site binding model.
Peptide pull-downs assays
Purified recombinant TONSL ARD (residues 512-692) was stored at 400 µM in 1 M NaCl,
20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 at -80 °C. For each pull-down, 400 pmol of the ARD stock (1 μl,
400 μM) was diluted with 99 μl of binding buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5,
5 % Glycerol, 0.25 % NP-40, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 mM
Leupeptin, 1 mM Pepstatin). ARD input material was scaled to the number of pull-downs
performed. For each pull-down, a H4 peptide (JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH) spanning
residues 14-33 (2.5 μl, 250 μM) with a C-terminal biotinoyl-lysine residue or, as control,
biotin (2.5 μl, 400 μM) was added to 1.1 ml of binding buffer in addition to 100 μl of the
ARD input material and the mixture incubated overnight rotating at 4 °C. The next day 25 μl
of MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads (Life Technologies) was washed in binding buffer (3 × 500

biotin mixture was added to an aliquot of pre-washed MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads and
incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 3 hours. Finally the beads were washed (2 × 300 μl and 1
× 200 μl of 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 5 % Glycerol, 0.25 % NP-40, 0.2 mM

material visualized by coomassie staining after SDS PAGE separation of proteins on a
NuPAGE 4–12 % gel.
For pull-downs from cell extracts, MyOne T1 beads were incubated O/N with 1 μg of
biotinylated peptides in High Salt (HS; 300mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, Tris HCl, EDTA, 5%
glycerol) buffer and subsequently washed 2 times with PBS. 1 mg of NP40/NaCl extract
from HeLa S3 or GFP-TONSL U-2-OS cells was added to the beads and incubated for 2
hours rotating at 4°C. The beads were then washed 5 times with HS buffer, 2 min rotating at
4°C. After washing, the beads were resuspended in 1 × LSB and boiled for 10 min. The
eluted proteins were loaded on a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPage gel (LifeTechnologies). Proteins
were then transferred to a 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane by O/N wet transfer at 20V and
detected by western blotting.

Modified nucleosomes of H4K20me0 or H4K20me2 were prepared by peptide ligation and
stored at 0.1 μg/μl (by histone octamer) in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 at 4 °C.
Full-length TONSL-MMS22L complex was stored at 746 nM in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris
HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% Glycerol, 0.5 mM PMSF at -80 °C. Nucleosome
pull-downs were performed across two sets of conditions (n=3 for each condition) in the
presence of Herring Sperm competitor DNA. Condition #1: Nucleosomes (1 μg by histone
octamer) or Biotin (0.5 μg) were mixed with TONSL-MMS22L (1.9 pmoles) and made up to
30 μl with binding buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 20 % Glycerol, 0.1 %
NP-40, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors and 10 μg/ml Herring Sperm DNA (Sigma)). Inputs
of 10 μl were taken before diluting each sample with binding buffer to a final volume of 300
μl and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Pull-downs were performed by adding 20 μl of MyOne
Streptavidin C1 beads prewashed and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer to each pulldown reaction, incubating at 4 °C for 2 hours, washing with 5 × 500 μl binding buffer 2 min

U-2-OS (kind gift of Dr. Bartek, the Danish Cancer Society, Denmark), HeLa S3 (kind gift
of Dr. Nakatami, Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, US) and TIG-3 (kind gift of Dr. Hansen,
BRIC, University of Copenhagen, Denmark) cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) containing
10% FBS (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and drugs for selection. The construct
for siRNA resistant GFP-TONSL was described2 and ARD mutation were introduced in this
construct by site-directed mutagenesis. The construct for pBABE-SNAP-HA-H4 plasmid
was described36 and H4 tail mutations were introduced in this construct by site-directed
mutagenesis. Cells inducible for GFP-TONSL WT and ARD mutants were generated in FlpIn T-Rex U-2-OS cells (Invitrogen) by transfection of pcDNA5/FRT/TO-GFP-TONSL
plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and selection
with hygromycin (200 µg/ml). Previously described inducible GFP-TONSL U-2-OS cells1
were used for Fig. 1h and Fig. 2c,e. U-2-OS Flag-HA-MCM2 WT and Y81A, Y90A were
previously described7. pBABE-AsiSI–ER–HA29 was introduced into inducible GFPTONSL cell lines by lentiviral infection and puromycin selection. All cell lines were
authenticated by western blotting and/or immunofluorescence. All cell lines used in this
study tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. Expression of GFP-TONSL was
induced by addition of 1 μg/ml of tetracycline for 24 hours. U-2-OS and TIG3 cells were
synchronized by a single thymidine block (2mM) and released into S phase in the presence
of 24 μM dCTP. For transient expression of GFP-TONSL or SNAP-HA-H4 (Fig. 1h, j),
expression plasmids were introduced by transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and cells harvested 24 hours after transfection.
siRNA transfection was performed with RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. All siRNAs were used to a final concentration of 50 nM.

Solubilized chromatin was then collected by centrifugation at 16.000 g for 10 mins.
Immunoprecipitation from cell extracts
Immunoprecipitation was performed with agarose magnetic GFP-Trap beads (Chromotek),
anti-FLAG magnetic beads (Sigma) and anti-HA magnetic beads (Life Technologies). Cell
extracts were incubated with beads for 2 hours at 4°C rotating. The beads were subsequently
washed 5 times with HS buffer and resuspended in 1 × LSB prior to boiling and SDS PAGE
separation of proteins on a NuPAGE 4–12 % gel.

Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and analysis
For analysis of cell cycle progression, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with
propidum iodide/RNase for 30 minutes in the dark, before analysis on a FACS Calibur
machine. FACS profiles were analyzed by FlowJo 10.0.8 software.
Mass spectrometry
Histones from TIG3 fibroblasts were extracted from chromatin as previously described18.
Protein was resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB,
Sigma), pH adjusted with 2 µl of 1.5 M Tris pH 8 and digested for 16 hours at 37°C with 3
µl of 20 ng/μl Asp-N (Wako) in 100 mM TEAB. After 15 min centrifugation at 10.000 g at
25°C, the SN was placed in a new tube and digestion was repeated for the pellet during 4
hours at the conditions described above. The digested peptides of both digestions were
merged, acidified with 10 µl of 1 % TFA and purified using sequential Stagetip C18 and
Carbon Toptip (Glygen). Purified peptides were evaporated, resuspended in 15 µl of 0.1 %

Immunofluorescence, microscopy and laser microirradiation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

U-2-OS cells conditional for GFP-TONSL were grown on glass coverslips or 96-well plates
and either directly fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 mins or washed in CSK, preextracted 5 min with cold CSK/0.5% Triton X-100 and rinsed with CSK and PBS before
fixation in 4% PFA for 10 mins. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol
mounting medium (Sigma Aldrich) containing DAPI. Fluorescence images were collected
on a DeltaVision system with a 40X or 60X oil immersion objective. For co-localization
analysis by deconvolution microscopy, z-stacks were acquired (step of 0.2 μm), deconvolved
and analysed by SoftWoRX 5.0.0. Pearson coefficient correlation analysis was performed on
single cells using SoftWoRX 5.0.0. Brightness and contrast were adjusted using Adobe
Photoshop CS6. For high content quantitative analysis, fluorescence images were acquired
using an Olympus ScanR high-content microscope and processed on the ScanR analysis
software. More than 5000 cells per sample were analysed. Cell cycle phases were gated on
DAPI and EdU intensity. Graphs were generated with TIBCO Spotfire software. For
microirradiation experiments, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4%
formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilised with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min
and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in DMEM for 1 hour at room temperature.
Following staining with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 568 and 647; Life
Technologies) for 30 min, coverslips were mounted on glass slides in Vectashield mounting
medium (Vector Laboratories) containing the nuclear stain DAPI. For detection of
nucleotide incorporation during DNA replication, an EdU-Plus labeling kit (Life
Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Confocal images were
acquired on an LSM-780 (Carl Zeiss) mounted on a Zeiss-AxioObserver Z1 equipped with a
Plan-Neofluar 40X/1.3 oil immersion objective. Image acquisition and analysis was carried
out with LSM-ZEN software. Laser microirradiation of cells was performed essentially as
described38.
ChIP
GFP-TONSL WT and N571A U-2-OS harbouring the inducible ER-HA-AsiSI
endonuclease29 were treated with 4-OHT and 10μM DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 (Millipore)
for 4 hours to increase HR efficiency39. Cells were cross-linked for 10 min in 1%
formaldehyde and chromatin was fragmented by sonication using Bioruptor Sonicator
(Diagenode). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described40
with the following modifications: 30 μg of chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of
anti-GFP (Abcam, ab290) and rabbit-IgG. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analysed in
duplicate by RT-qPCR. In all cases, γH2A.X induction was verified by immunofluorescence
and a sample without 4-OHT was included as a ‘no cut’ control. Primer pairs for the analysis
of DSB-3, DSB-I and DSB-II are described41. Primer sequences used for the amplification

The NCC protocol19 was adjusted for adherent U-2-OS cells. CPT (1μM) was added 5
minutes prior to b-dUTP labelling and was included in all steps until fixation. Cells were
incubated for 5 minutes in a hypotonic buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes) containing
biotin-dUTP and resuspended into fresh cell culture medium for an additional 15 minutes.
Cells were fixed 15 minutes in 1% formaldehyde, rinsed twice in PBS and collected by
scraping in cold room. Nuclei were mechanically isolated in sucrose buffer (0.3 M sucrose,
10 mM HEPES-NaOH at pH 7.9, 1% Triton X-100 and 2mM MgOAc). Chromatin was
solubilized by 28 cycles 30 sec ON, 90 sec OFF in sonication buffer (10 mM HEPES-NaOH
at pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA at pH 8, 1 mM EGTA at pH 8, 0.2% SDS, 0.1%
sodium sarkosyl and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride) using a Bioruptor at 4° C.
Solubilized chromatin was pre-cleared using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (MyC1
Streptavidin beads) pre-incubated with biotin. b-dUTP labelled chromatin was next purified
over night at 4° C using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Beads were washed 5 times for
2 minutes in wash buffer (10 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.9; 200 mM NaCl; 2 mM EDTA pH 8;
1 mM EGTA pH 8; 0.1% SDS; 1 mM PMSF). Total chromatin (input) and isolated nascent
chromatin were boiled 40 min on beads in LSB 1 X (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 100 mM
DTT, 2% SDS, 8% Glycerol, Bromophenol blue) and separated by SDS-PAGE for western

contacts spanning the Lys12-Gly13-Gly14-Ala15 segment of H4 include hydrophobic
interactions between residues Gly13, Gly14 and Ala15 of H4 and residues Asn507, Cys508,
Trp641, Tyr645 and Leu649 of ARD, as well as hydrogen bonds between the main-chain O
of H4 Gly14 and Nε1 of ARD Trp641, and between the main-chain N of H4 Ala15 and Oη
of ARD Tyr645 (a; Fig. 1c). The main-chain O of H4 Lys16 hydrogen bonds with the Nδ2 of
ARD Asn571, while the side-chain of H4 Lys16 forms contacts with ARD Asn607 and
electrostatic interactions with the side-chain of ARD Glu597 (Fig. 1c). The side-chain of H4
Arg17 stacks over the side-chains of ARD Tyr572 and Cys608, while its Nη1 atom forms
two hydrogen bonds with main-chain O and Oδ1 of ARD Asn571 (Fig. 1c,e). The side-chain
of H4 H18 penetrates into a pocket lined by four strictly conserved residues (Trp563,

a, Superposition of the structures of TONSL ARD and BARD1 ARD (PDB 3C5R, Fox D.
3rd et al. JBC 2008). The main residues involved in TONSL ARD interactions with the H4
tail are compared to the corresponding residues of BARD1 ARD. The two ARDs show
highly similar topology and conservation of the histone-binding surface. b, Input material of
the experiment in Fig. 1h. c, Input material of the experiment in Fig. 1j. d, Spot assay with
biotinylated H4 tail (aa. 14-33) peptides confirming equal input into pull down reactions. e,
Input material of the experiment in Fig. 4b. f, Input material of the NCC experiment in Fig.
4c. Note that because ARD mutation disrupts chromatin binding in the presence and absence
of CPT (Fig. 3e-f, 4a), GFP-TONSL N517 levels are low in the input chromatin. The NCC
experiment in Fig. 4c supports our microscopy-based data (Fig. 4a) and further shows that
there is no local accumulation of the GFP-TONSL ARD mutant at damaged forks that could
have been missed in our microscopy-based quantification of total TONSL on chromatin.
