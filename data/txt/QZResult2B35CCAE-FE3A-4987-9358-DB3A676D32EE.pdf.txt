BACKGROUND: Maintenance treatment with the oral poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib
(Lynparza) in Study 19 (study number, D0810C00019; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00753545) significantly improved progressionfree survival in comparison with a placebo for patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed serous ovarian cancer with a BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCAm), but an interim analysis revealed no statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit. However, 23% of the patients
receiving the placebo switched to a PARP inhibitor after progression. To investigate whether this had a confounding effect on OS, this
article reports an exploratory post hoc analysis that excluded all patients from sites where 1 or more placebo patients received postprogression PARP inhibitor treatment. METHODS: In Study 19, 136 of the 265 patients receiving olaparib or a placebo had a BRCAm.
Sixteen patients treated at 11 of the 82 investigational sites received a PARP inhibitor after progression; these sites were excluded
from this analysis, and 97 BRCAm patients at 50 sites were included. OS was assessed with a Cox proportional hazards model analogous to the primary study analysis. A supporting rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) model analysis was undertaken for
all 136 BRCAm patients. RESULTS: The OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.97) for the 97 BRCAm
patients, whereas for the interim OS analysis with all 136 BRCAm patients, it was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.45-1.17). The supportive RPSFT analysis HR was approximately 0.66. CONCLUSIONS: The numerical improvement in the OS HR suggests that in Study 19, postprogression
PARP inhibitor treatment had a confounding influence on the interim OS analysis for BRCAm patients. There is a degree of uncerC 2016 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer mortality in women in the United States, and patients typically
present with advanced stage III or IV disease.1 Although the majority of patients will experience an initial response to platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy, most will develop a recurrence of their cancer within 12 to 18 months.2
The Cancer Genome Atlas Project has reported that up to 50% of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer
may have homologous recombination repair deficiencies such as a BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCAm).3 Therapies directed toward DNA damage repair pathways in tumor cells with a BRCAm have shown effectiveness in ovarian cancer. The

inhibitor class blocks base-excision repair of single-strand
DNA breaks and impairs high-fidelity repair of doublestrand DNA breaks via other mechanisms.4 In DNA replication in tumor cells with homologous recombination
repair deficiencies, impaired DNA repair leads to irreparable double-strand breaks being formed; these induce tumor cell death by synthetic lethality.4
In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration
granted accelerated approval of olaparib for the treatment
of patients with relapsed germline BRCA1/2 mutation
(gBRCAm) ovarian cancer who have received 3 or more
lines of chemotherapy; the lack of a significant overall survival (OS) benefit in the maintenance setting after
platinum-based chemotherapy in platinum-sensitive
patients was a concern of the Oncologic Drug Advisory
Committee.5 The European Medicines Agency granted
approval of olaparib as monotherapy for the maintenance
treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive,
relapsed BRCAm (germline and/or somatic) serous ovarian cancer who have responded to platinum-based chemotherapy on the basis of data from Study 19 (study
number, D0810C00019; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier,
NCT00753545).6
Study 19 was a randomized phase 2 clinical trial that
assessed the efficacy of olaparib versus a placebo for the
treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive serous ovarian cancer after treatment with 2 or more platinumcontaining regimens. The study demonstrated that maintenance monotherapy with olaparib at 400 mg twice daily
(capsule formulation) led to a significant improvement in
progression-free survival (PFS) in comparison with the placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.25-0.49; P < .001),7 most notably in patients with
a BRCAm (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10-0.31, P < .0001).8
However, no statistically significant benefit in interim
(58% maturity) OS was observed in either the overall (HR,
0.88; 95% CI, 0.64-1.21; P 5 .44) or BRCAm populations
(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.45-1.17; P 5 .19).8
The degradation of the OS benefit from olaparib
maintenance therapy, especially in BRCAm patients, was
hypothesized to have occurred because of subsequent therapies received by patients (in particular, patients randomized
to the placebo who received a PARP inhibitor in a subsequent trial); thus, the treatment effect on OS may have
been confounded. Switching from the placebo to olaparib
was not permitted within the design of Study 19, but once
patients receiving olaparib or the placebo had discontinued
the study medication, other treatment options, including
Cancer

PARP inhibitors, were at the discretion of the investigator;
patients continued to be followed for survival.
To investigate whether the OS results of Study 19
may have been confounded by patients who had initially
received the placebo and then switched to active PARP inhibitor treatment after progression or after discontinuation, we report a post hoc exploratory analysis of interim
OS data that excluded all patients from the sites where at
least 1 patient received postprogression treatment with a
PARP inhibitor. We also report an alternative supporting
analysis, the rank-preserving structural failure time
(RPSFT) model approach,9 which uses the full data set
and applies statistical methodology to adjust for treatment
switching and allows for the estimation of the crossovercorrected treatment effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

Study 19 was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial undertaken at 82 sites in 16 countries. The
study design, patient population, and statistical analyses
have previously been published in detail.7,8 In brief, the
primary endpoint of Study 19 was PFS determined with
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST;
version 1.0), and OS was a secondary endpoint. Eligible
patients were aged 18 years or older and had relapsed serous (grade 2 or 3) ovarian cancer that was platinumsensitive. Sensitivity was defined as no disease progression
in the first 6 months after the last dose of the penultimate
line of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients entering
the study were required to have received 2 or more previous courses of platinum-based chemotherapy and to have
had an objective response (complete or partial) according
to RECIST or Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup criteria.
Patients were randomly assigned to olaparib (400mg capsules twice daily) or a matching placebo in a 1:1
ratio, and randomization was stratified by the time from
the completion of the penultimate platinum-based regimen to disease progression (6-12 months vs >12
months), the objective response to platinum therapy
before randomization (complete response vs partial
response), and ethnic descent (Jewish vs non-Jewish). The
classification of BRCA variants for the exploratory analysis
reported here was performed in a blinded fashion and retrospectively, and was based on the recommendations of
the American College of Medical Genetics.10 Patients
were included in the BRCAm group if they harbored or
were suspected to harbor a deleterious gBRCAm or tumor

(somatic) DNA mutation (somatic BRCA1/2 mutation
[sBRCAm]).
Tumor assessments were performed every 12 weeks
until week 60 and every 24 weeks thereafter until objective
disease progression or the withdrawal of patient consent.
Adverse events were graded with the National Cancer
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0). The study was blinded, and all participants, clinicians, and those assessing outcomes were
masked to treatment assignment. All patients provided
written informed consent, and the trial protocol was
approved by all relevant institutional ethical committees
or review bodies. The study was performed in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki, good clinical practice
(International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use), and the AstraZeneca policy on bioethics.11
Study Objectives for the Post Hoc Exploratory
Analysis

To investigate whether the OS results from Study 19 may
have been confounded by the postprogression use of
PARP inhibitors, we conducted an exploratory post hoc
analysis of OS that, to control for treatment switching,
excluded all patients from the sites where at least 1 patient
received postprogression treatment with a PARP inhibitor
with the RPSFT approach.9 RPSFT models were developed originally to correct statistical analyses for observed
noncompliance in clinical trials. The method reduces the
weighting of the information contributed by crossover
patients and, therefore, reduces their impact on the
observed effect. The key assumption underpinning the
method is that the effect of the treatment is constant and
does not depend on when it is received (ie, before or after).
Excluding only the patients who had received postprogression PARP inhibitor treatment instead of excluding
all patients from the sites where at least 1 patient received
postprogression PARP inhibitor treatment was not considered statistically feasible, because patients who went on
to receive a PARP inhibitor in a subsequent study were
patients that we hypothesized would have had a comparably good prognosis, which would likely have been an entry
criterion to the study in which the additional PARP inhibitor treatment was received. Excluding patients with a
potentially good prognosis from just the placebo treatment arm would, therefore, have resulted in a biased statistical analysis. Thus, to retain a balanced cohort after the
removal of patients who switched treatment, all patients
from the sites where at least 1 patient received postprogression treatment with a PARP inhibitor were removed
1846

from the analysis. This also included patients who may
have died. The reasons for patients switching treatments
were not known, but the switching was likely attributable
to access to other clinical trials of PARP inhibitors because
these agents were available only in a clinical study. An alternative supporting RPSFT analysis, which included all
sites and all patients, was also conducted.
Statistical Analyses

In Study 19, PFS and OS (defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause) were
assessed with a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted
for treatment, ethnic descent (Jewish vs non-Jewish), the
time to progression on penultimate platinum therapy
(6-12 vs >12 months), and the response to platinum therapy before randomization (complete response vs partial
response).
The post hoc exploratory OS analysis reported here
analyzed interim data (52% maturity in the BRCAm population of Study 19). The same definition of OS was used
for the exploratory analysis, as was used in the primary
analysis. The exploratory analysis was also consistent with
the methodology for the primary OS analysis, in that a
Cox proportional hazards model with factors for treatment, ethnic descent, platinum sensitivity, and response
to final platinum therapy was applied.7 The RPSFT
model used in this analysis reduces the treatment switching bias and allows treatment effects to be assessed more
accurately by reconstructing data for the placebo arm to
mimic a setting, as though switching had not occurred.9,12
The RPSFT approach assumes that the effect of the investigational treatment starts at the first dose and ends when
the investigational treatment stops and that the treatment
effect is equal, regardless of whether the treatment is initiated at the start of the study before disease progression or
after disease progression has occurred.
To help understand whether placebo patients benefited from subsequent PARP inhibitors, in the absence of
RECIST scans, the duration of treatment (ie, the time
that the patient was receiving the placebo vs the time that
the patient was receiving a subsequent PARP inhibitor)
was used as a proxy for PFS, which was not collected past
the primary analysis. This is considered appropriate
because the protocol specified that patients were to continue with the study treatment until RECIST progression,
and thus in Study 19, the median PFS and duration of
treatment were very similar at 11 months. In addition, to
further characterize the placebo patients who received a
subsequent PARP inhibitor, individual patient profiles of
subsequent PARP inhibitor therapy, progression, time to

therapy were created.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Demographics

In Study 19, 265 patients met the eligibility criteria; 136
of these patients were randomly assigned to receive olaparib, and 129 were assigned a placebo. In total, 74 of
the 136 patients (54%) who received olaparib and 62 of
the 129 (48%) who received the placebo were identified
as having BRCAm ovarian cancer (on the basis of germline and/or tumor testing). The majority of the investigational sites (71 of 82) reported no patients who had
received a PARP inhibitor after disease progression.
Once all patients from the sites where at least 1 patient
had received postprogression treatment with a PARP
inhibitor were removed, the resulting patient population
consisted of 97 patients from 50 sites out of 136 BRCAm
patients (71%) from 61 sites. Fourteen of the 62 BRCAm
placebo patients (23%) were known to have received a
PARP inhibitor after the study treatment period
(13 with a gBRCAm and 1 with a sBRCAm). In addition,
2 further patients known to have received a PARP
inhibitor, after the study treatment period had a BRCAm
variant of unknown significance (Fig. 1).
Before progression, no placebo patients were
reported to have received a PARP inhibitor, and no olaparib patients received any other PARP inhibitor therapy.
The demographic characteristics of the BRCAm patients
(n 5 97) included in the post hoc analysis were similar to
those of the BRCAm patients (n 5 136; Table 1).8 In
addition, the demographic characteristics of the patients
receiving the placebo who also subsequently received a
PARP inhibitor were further compared with those of the
patients receiving the placebo who did not receive a PARP
inhibitor (Table 2).
Although only a small number of patients (n 5 16;
13 with a gBRCAm, 1 with an sBRCAm, and 2 with a
BRCAm variant of unknown significance) received a subsequent PARP inhibitor, the 14 BRCAm patients represented nearly a quarter (23%) of the 62 placebo patients
identified as having BRCAm ovarian cancer. Table 2 highlights that there was a greater proportion of younger
patients (<50 years old), patients of Jewish descent, and
patients with a BRCAm in the group that received a subsequent PARP inhibitor in comparison with the patients
who did not.
These 16 patients had a longer treatment duration
with their subsequent PARP inhibitor than the original

Study 19 randomized placebo therapy (Fig. 2). This
observation, in conjunction with the study observation
that the duration of treatment was a reasonable proxy for
PFS, suggests that despite its later use, patients still
derived a benefit from the PARP inhibitor. This analysis
was conducted for all placebo patients who received a subsequent PARP inhibitor (n 5 16); however, an analysis of
the 14 BRCAm placebo patients showed similar results.
To further characterize the 14 BRCAm placebo
patients who received a subsequent PARP inhibitor, individual patient profiles were plotted that showed the time
to first subsequent therapy and the time to second subsequent therapy (Fig. 3). Figure 3 shows that patients did
not generally receive a PARP inhibitor as part of immediate further therapy because the mean gap between progression and treatment switching was 12 months (range,
0.5-36 months).
OS Results: Effect on OS

OS outcomes for olaparib-treated populations were similar whether sites at which post-trial PARP inhibitor treatment was received were excluded or not (median in both
cases, 34.9 months; Fig. 4). OS outcomes for placebo1847

treated patients were different; the median was 26.6
months at sites without post-trial PARP inhibitor access,
but 31.9 months when sites with a post-trial PARP inhibitor were included. The OS analysis for the BRCAm subgroup (n 5 97) resulted in a HR of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.280.97; Fig. 4). The supportive RPSFT approach resulted in
HRs of 0.654 and 0.664 (CI not estimated) with corresponding acceleration factors of 0.20 and 0.31, respectively. Both analyses suggest that the OS results for the
overall BRCAm population (n 5 136) unadjusted for

DISCUSSION
In this post hoc exploratory OS analysis from Study 19,
all patients from the sites that had any placeborandomized BRCAm patients who received a PARP inhibitor treatment after progression (n 5 39) were removed.
This resulted in an OS HR result from the Cox proportional hazards model of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.28-0.97),

suggests that there was an underestimation of the OS

and the patients receiving olaparib in the BRCAm population of Study 19. Thus, switching to PARP inhibitor therapy after disease progression may have diminished the

apparent beneficial impact of olaparib on OS within the
context of the study because the patients in the control
arm who switched gained an OS benefit from receiving a
PARP inhibitor after progression. Although switching to
olaparib or another PARP inhibitor from the initial placebo was not allowed in Study 19 and there were no
approved PARP inhibitors available, patients who
switched treatments received a PARP inhibitor as part of a
different clinical study. The demographics (Table 1) for
the reduced population (n 5 97) were not dissimilar to
those of the total Study 19 BRCAm population (n 5
136), and this suggested no obvious demographic bias.
Furthermore, the RPSFT analysis approach also
corroborated the suggestion of an underestimation of OS
differences introduced by the 14 placebo-randomized
patients who switched treatment to a PARP inhibitor.
Patients Receiving Active Treatment After the
Study

In Study 19, patients went into long-term follow-up after
disease progression or the data cutoff for the primary PFS
analysis (June 30, 2010) with no further scans; therefore,
limited information was available for patients at the time
of the initiation of PARP inhibitor therapy. Additional
understanding of the circumstances of the subsequent
1850

PARP inhibitor treatment was gained from the individual
patient profiles (Fig. 3), which indicated that patients did
not generally receive a PARP inhibitor as part of their
immediate further therapy.
It is a common occurrence and is largely unpreventable in oncology trials for patients assigned to receive a
placebo to later switch to active therapy after the primary
endpoint has been reached.13 This is particularly the case
when the investigational therapy has demonstrated beneficial activity. In placebo-controlled trials, switching to
active therapy could be in the best interest of patients and
may be mandated by investigators and ethics committees.14 However, switching treatments has the potential to
confound key efficacy endpoints such as OS if standard
statistical methods (eg, intention-to-treat analysis) are
used. To minimize the impact of patients switching treatment, the most common approach is to adjust for switching effects in the statistical analysis instead of making
changes in the initial study design, which are suggested to
be seldom feasible or rarely implemented in practice.13
In the ongoing phase 3 olaparib trials for ovarian
cancer, SOLO-1 (NCT01844986) and SOLO-2
(NCT01874353), there is an expectation that placebo
patients will similarly gain access to PARP inhibitors after
progression, either in clinical trials or through licensed
Cancer

Olaparib Therapy: Adjusted OS/Matulonis et al

prescription. This is expected to similarly affect the ability
to demonstrate an OS benefit. To mitigate the impact of
switching, statistical analyses that compensate for switching (eg, RPSFT,9 inverse-probability-of-censoring
weighting,15 and other methods in development) should
be prespecified in the study protocol, and comprehensive
data collection, including the reasons for switching,
should be conducted for postprogression treatments.
Statistical Methodology

In Study 19, RECIST scans were not performed after the
primary analysis of PFS; consequently, an assessment of
PFS with subsequent PARP inhibitor treatment was not
possible. It is, therefore, difficult to quantify the magnitude of the benefit afforded to the switched patients.
However, patients were treated until progression, and
accordingly, data from the intention-to-treat population
in Study 19 demonstrated that the duration of randomized therapy could serve as a substitute for PFS. This has
enabled us to conclude that the switched patients did
receive a benefit from treatment with olaparib (or another
PARP inhibitor), and this biased the analysis of OS
against olaparib.
Because it is not possible to know what the treatment effect would have been if no patients had switched
treatment, we attempted to adjust the analysis to explore
this bias. Here we have investigated 2 approaches. The
first method adjusted the population by removing all
patients from a site where any patient received a PARP inhibitor and thus maintained the benefits of randomization
and reduced the impact of selective exclusion; the evaluation was made with Cox proportional hazards analysis,
and it was consistent with the PFS and OS analysis.7 The
second method adjusted the switched patients and used
the RPSFT model, which enabled additional evidence
supporting the hypothesis that the true treatment effect
had been confounded. Health technology assessment
bodies, such as the United Kingdom’s National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence, have accepted the RPSFT
methodology as valuable supporting evidence.16 Further
details behind the reasoning for the use of the statistical
methodology and its advantages and disadvantages are
described in the online supporting information.
In conclusion, the post hoc exploratory analysis
reported here, which excluded all patients from the sites
where at least 1 patient received postprogression treatment with a PARP inhibitor, resulted in a change in the
OS HR that may suggest that a confounding influence
had the effect of masking the beneficial impact of olaparib
on OS for patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent,

mature data would allow further profiling and a more precise estimate of the nonconfounded effect.
