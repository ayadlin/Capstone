BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) cell lines frequently express both insulin-like growth factor (IGF) ligand and the
cognate IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and, as such, potentially depend on the activation of IGF-1R and its downstream effectors for growth
and survival. Preclinical studies suggest that somatostatin analogs and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors exhibit
antitumor activity against NETs through inhibition of IGF-1-dependent signaling, suggesting that IGF-1R inhibition may be a promising
therapeutic approach to NETs. Therefore, the authors of this report evaluated the safety and efficacy of MK-0646, a fully
human monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that binds to the IGF-1R, as monotherapy in patients with metastatic, well-differentiated NETs.
METHODS: A phase 2 study was performed in which patients received intravenous MK-0646 10 mg/kg once weekly over 1 hour.
Archived pretreatment tumor tissue was obtained and genotyped for v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS),
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA); and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF)
mutations, and immunohistochemistry was performed to measure the expression IGF-1R. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients received
treatment (40% women; median age, 61 years; age range, 37-83 years), including 15 patients with carcinoid tumors and 10 patients
with pancreatic NETs. No partial or complete responses were observed. The median progression-free survival was 4.2 months in the
pancreatic NET cohort (range, 0.7-6.7 months) and 2.7 months in the carcinoid cohort (range, 2-3 months). Serious adverse events
that were potentially related to MK-0646 included grade 3/4 hyperglycemia in 8 of 25 patients (32%), grade 2 hypersensitivity reaction in 1 of 24 patients (4%), and grade 3 lipase elevation in 1 of 25 patients (4%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a compelling preclinical
rationale, MK-0646 was inactive as a single agent in well-differentiated NETs. Further studies of MK-0646 as a monotherapy in unseC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) is a member of a family of transmembrane tyrosine kinases that
includes the insulin receptor and the orphan insulin receptor-related receptor.1 Many preclinical and clinical studies have
implicated the IGF-1R and its ligands, IGF-1 and IGF-2, in the development and progression of cancer.2-4 The principal
pathways for transduction of the IGF signal are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (PI3K/Akt) pathways.2 MK-0646 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa antibody that targets IGF-1R. Signaling through IGF-1R mediates cell growth and proliferation as well as resistance to apoptosis in many solid tumors.5 There are 2 possible mechanisms of action of MK-0646: 1)
inhibition of IGF-1–mediated cell signaling and 2) antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
Preclinical in vitro studies suggest that somatostatin analogs and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors exhibit antitumor activity against neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) through the inhibition of IGF-1-dependent signaling.6,7 The antitumor activity of the latter, however, may be attenuated by the induction of AKT activity upon CREBregulated transcription coactivator 1 (TORC1) inhibition through the relief of feedback inhibition of upstream receptor
tyrosine kinases like IGF-1R. NETs and NET cell lines frequently express both IGFs and the IGF-1R receptor and, as
such, potentially depend on autocrine or paracrine stimulation by this pathway for growth and survival.8-11 In a carcinoid
tumor cell line (BON), it has been demonstrated that exogenous IGF activates mTOR, increases cellular proliferation,
and increases secretion of chromogranin-A, which is a marker protein of neuroendocrine progression.9 Thus, we hypothesized that upstream inhibition at the level of the IGF-1R receptor may have greater antitumor activity than rapalogues in

patients with advanced NETs. Therefore, we conducted a
phase 2 trial of the anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody
(MoAb) MK-0646 in patients with advanced NETs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a single-institution, investigator-initiated phase
2 trial in patients with metastatic NETs. The trial was
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and
was conducted in accordance with US Department of
Health and Human Services guidelines. Written informed
consent was obtained from each patient The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as National Clinical Trial
NCT00610129.
Patient Selection

Eligible patients were required to have histologic or cytologic confirmation of well-differentiated NET with measurable, metastatic disease according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.
There was no limit on the number of prior treatment regimens. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, they
had to be aged 18 years, and they had to have a life expectancy >3 months. Adequate bone marrow and kidney
function were required, as was a bilirubin level <1.5 times
the upper limit of normal. Patients were excluded if they
had received any prior IGF-R–directed agents or if they
had inadequately controlled diabetes mellitus, defined as a
fasting blood glucose level >120 mg/dL or a hemoglobin
A1c level >8%. Patients were allowed to continue on
somatostatin analog therapy. The decision to stop the somatostatin analog before initiating MK-0646 was at the
discretion of the treating physician. All patients who
had hormone symptoms (ie, functional) continued on
octreotide therapy.
Therapy

Patients received MK-0646 as an intravenous, 1-hour
infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Treatment was continued
weekly until patients developed disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity, as defined below, or until the
patient withdrew consent. The National Cancer Institute
Common Adverse Event Criteria (NCI-CTCAE) version
3.0 was used to grade adverse effects. For all grade 3 or 4
toxicities that were possibly or probably related to MK0646, treatment was withheld until symptoms returned to
baseline or to grade 2 with treatment; then, the patient
was restarted with the dose reduced by 7.5 mg/kg and 6
mg/kg for grade 3 or 4 toxicity, respectively.
For the assessment of hyperglycemia (diabetes),
NCI-CTCAE version 3.0 endocrine terminology was
4796

used. For grade 3 hyperglycemia (‘‘symptoms interfering
with activities of daily living’’ or ‘‘insulin indicated’’),
MK-0646 was withheld if symptoms were present or if
the serum glucose level was 300 mg/dL; MK-0646 was
resumed when the patient was asymptomatic, glucose was
consistently <220 mg/dL, and the patient was on a stable
insulin regimen. In such cases, the MK-0646 dose was
reduced to 7.5 mg/kg. For grade 4 hyperglycemia, MK0646 therapy was withheld until the patient was asymptomatic, glucose was consistently <220 mg/dL, and the
patient was on a stable insulin regimen. When treatment
resumed, the MK-0646 dose was reduced to 6 mg/kg.
Evaluation Criteria

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis with liver triphasic imaging
were obtained at baseline and every 12 weeks. Responses
were categorized according to standard RECIST (version
1.0) criteria. Response and progression were determined
by a single reference radiologist. The primary objective of
the study was to evaluate the effect of MK-0646 on the
objective response rate. The secondary objective was evaluation of progression-free and overall survival.
Correlative Laboratory Analysis of Tissue
Samples
Immunohistochemical analysis

Pretreatment archival tissue was collected and
assayed for IGF-1R expression by immunohistochemistry
(IHC). IHC for IGF-1R was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to IGF-1R (Ventana Medical Systems,
Inc., Tucson, Ariz). The staining was scored based on the
intensity (from 0 to 3þ) and the percentage of stained
tumor cells.
Genotyping

For genotyping studies, hematoxylin and eosinstained slides were reviewed to ensure adequate tumor
content by a reference pathologist before DNA extraction.
Sections (5 to 6 lm thick) cut from paraffin-embedded
tumor samples were available for 10 of 25 patients and
were evaluated for v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), and phosphatidylinositol3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA)
mutations using a chip-based, matrix-assisted, laser
desorption-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry-based assay (Sequenom, San Diego, Calif) and
confirmed with Sanger sequencing, the details of which
have been published previously.12-14 An additional 15

genetic analysis after IRB waiver of approval was provided.
Statistical Considerations

The initial planned sample size for the first stage of a Simon
2-stage design was a total of 36 patients (18 carcinoid and
18 pancreatic NETs). Because of poor accrual, the study
statistics were modified so that, if 2 or more (of the first 15
patients) in each stratum had an objective response in an
Cancer

October 1, 2012

arm, then enrollment would be extended to 18 patients. If
3 or more confirmed major responses were observed of 18
patients in a stratum, then enrollment would be extended
to a total of 44 patients in each stratum. On the basis of a
Simon 2-stage design with a null response rate of 13% and
an alternative of 30% and with type I and type II error rates
of 10%, at the end of the stage 2, a regimen was to be considered promising if 9 of 44 treated patients in that arm
experienced an objective response. Overall and progression-free survival curves were estimated using the KaplanMeier method. Because of poor accrual in the pancreatic
NET cohort, that arm was closed after enrolling 10
patients. This was done because the probability of observing no responses in 10 patients was 0.03 assuming an objective response rate of 30%, which made it very unlikely that
promising activity in the first stage would have been
observed had the study accrued to the prespecified enrollment of 15 patients in the first stage.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

patients (72%) had received prior somatostatin analog
therapy. All patients had documented disease progression
within 6 months of starting therapy with MK-0646. The
median number of systemic treatments before initiating
therapy was 1, and approximately 75% of the patients had
received 1 or 2 systemic regimens before enrollment.

Toxicity

All 25 patients were assessable for toxicity. Table 2 lists
the toxicities of MK-0646 that were possibly, probably, or
definitely attributable to the drug. The most common
adverse event that potentially was related to MK-0646
was hyperglycemia (8 of 25 patients [32%]; grade 3-4).
Cancer

October 1, 2012

MK-0646 in Well-Differentiated NETs/Reidy-Lagunes et al

Twenty-four of 25 patients who had data available had
laboratory glucose elevations at least 1 NCI-CTCAE
grade above baseline at some point during the study.
None of the hyperglycemia events had associated clinical
symptoms. Other severe adverse events included 1 of 25
patients (4%) patient with grade 3 lipase elevation and 1
of 25 patients (4%) with grade 2 hypersensitivity reaction;
the latter patient was given diphenhydramine and received
subsequent treatments without complication.
Efficacy

Twenty-eight patients were registered, although 3 were
deemed ineligible and were never treated. Of the 25
patients who were eligible for the study, all received at
least 1 dose of therapy and were assessable for response
and toxicity. The median number of treatment cycles was
2.76 (range 1-7 cycles; median, 4 cycles). No patient had
an objective response. The median progression-free survival was 4.2 months in the pancreatic NET cohort
(range, 0.7-6.7 months) and 2.7 months (range, 2-3
months) in the carcinoid cohort. Kaplan-Meier curves
illustrating progression-free and overall survival curves are
provided in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. At a median follow-up of 18 months, the median overall survival in the
carcinoid study arm was 10.5 months, and the median
overall survival was not yet reached in the pancreatic NET
cohort.
Correlative Assessments
Immunohistochemistry testing

Fourteen pretreatment formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples were assayed for IGF-1R expression
by IHC. Three of 9 carcinoid tumors demonstrated 1þ
IGF-1R expression, whereas the other 6 carcinoid tumors
were negative for IGF-1R by IHC. One of 4 pancreatic
NETs was 1þ positive for IGF-1R expression.
Genotyping

We used a chip-based MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay (Sequenom) to genotype 25 samples for
hotspot mutations in KRAS, BRAF, neuroblastoma v-ras
oncogene homolog (NRAS), and PIK3CA. A single pancreatic NET harbored a glutamic acid to lysine mutation
of codon 542 (E542K) in the helical domain of PIK3CA.
Because PIK3CA mutations had not been reported previously in patients with pancreatic NET at the time of our
analysis, we further assayed an additional 15 NETs from
our tissue bank for PIK3CA mutations. A second tumor (a
presumed small bowel carcinoid) also was identified that
harbored an identical E542K PIK3CA mutation for a total
frequency of 8%. No kinase domain mutations in
Cancer

PIK3CA were noted. All tumors were also wild-type for
KRAS, BRAF, and NRAS.
DISCUSSION
Given the promising preclinical data on IGF-1R–
directed therapies and its unequivocal activity with
mTOR inhibition, why was there no evidence of antitumor activity? In other solid tumors, mutations
downstream of the directed therapy confer resistance
to the upstream targeted therapy; antiepidermal
growth factor receptor-directed therapies, for example,
are restricted to patients with KRAS wild-type
tumors.15,16 Nevertheless, in all of our patients, the
tumors were wild-type KRAS and BRAF tumors;
therefore, we cannot explain this lack of activity. It is
noteworthy that 2 of the 25 tumors tumors (8%)
were identified with PIK3CA mutations (E542K in
both tumors). This mutation rate is higher than the
1.4% rate recently reported last month by Jiao
et al.17 In vitro studies have indicated that tumor cells
may be even more sensitive to mTOR inhibitors in
the presence of PIK3CA mutations. The presence of
these mutations, however, failed to produce a response
to MK-0646 in our patients.18
A second possible explanation for the lack of efficacy
of MK-0646 observed in this trial is that IGF-1R may not
have been highly activated in the patients enrolled. To
address this possibility, we determined IGF-1R expression
levels using IHC. In that analysis, we observed modest
staining (1þ) for IGF-1R in only 4 of 17 tumors. It
should be highlighted that total IGF-1R IHC expression
may be a poor indicator of the degree of IGF-1R activation. A review of these patients suggested that they did not
fare better than those who did not express IGF-1R.
A third explanation may be that we did not hit the
target. Phase 1 data, however, demonstrate evidence of
IGF-1R signal blockade in tumors. In that study, tumor
biopsies before and after treatment were obtained for
pharmacodynamic analyses. Thirteen patients had a
decrease in IGF-1R expression and inhibition of IGF-1R
signaling (decreases in phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated MAPK, and phosphorylated S6 protein), and a
decrease in Ki-67 was observed at doses >5 mg/kg.19 In
addition, many of our patients developed hyperglycemia,
which we believe indirectly indicates that the target is
being hit. A fourth explanation is that these were heavily
treated patients who were exposed to other targeted
agents, leading to the treatment of more resistant tumors
with MK-0646. However, as noted above, the median
number of treatments received before enrollment was 1,
4799

Original Article

and no patients were exposed to mTOR or vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. In addition, 80% of our
patients went on to receive additional therapy after disease
progression, and 50% of patients underwent elective hepatic embolization.
In summary, despite uncommonly compelling preclinical data, our study failed to demonstrate that targeting a pathway upstream of mTOR by binding to the IGF1R with MK-0646 was clinically helpful. Further studies
evaluating combinations of, perhaps, dual mTOR and
anti-IGF-1R inhibition as well as other combinations of
targeted therapies, including antiangiogenic agents, may
be warranted to further explore for possible uses of anti
IGF-1R strategies in advanced NETs.
A lesson reiterated by this clinical trial is the
large heterogeneity of the disease. To compensate for
this, we only included patients who had progressive
disease, and we believe the short progression-free survival reflects the natural history of this later phase of
the disease. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, however, and 80% went on to receive additional therapy
after progressing on this trial: All of this suggests that
their disease was not so far advanced that we could
have missed a signal. Consistent eligibility and clearly
defined patient populations like the population in the
current trial are critical for future studies. We also
believe that pretreatment and post-treatment biopsies
should be obtained in future trials whenever possible.
To date, the paucity of correlative studies in NET
clinical trials has limited our ability to develop a basic
scientific understanding of the relevant tumor signaling mechanisms. This negative trial also highlights the
need for multisite studies to continue efforts that
explore new targets in the treatment of this disease.
