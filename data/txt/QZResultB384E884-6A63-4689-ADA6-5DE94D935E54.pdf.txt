Abstract
Cancer is a disease consisting of both genetic and epigenetic changes. While increasing evidence
demonstrates that tumour progression entails chromatin-mediated changes such as DNA
methylation, the role of histone variants in cancer initiation and progression currently remains
unclear. Here, we report that the histone variant macroH2A (mH2A) suppresses tumour

progression of malignant melanoma. Loss of mH2A isoforms, histone variants generally
associated with condensed chromatin and fine-tuning of developmental gene expression
programs1-4, is positively correlated with increasing malignant phenotype of melanoma cells in
culture and human tissue samples. Knockdown of mH2A isoforms in melanoma cells of low
malignancy results in significantly increased proliferation and migration in vitro and growth and
metastasis in vivo. Restored expression of mH2A isoforms rescues these malignant phenotypes in
vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that the tumour promoting function of mH2A loss is mediated,
at least in part, through direct transcriptional up-regulation of CDK8. Suppression of CDK8, a
colorectal cancer oncogene5, 6, inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells, and knockdown of CDK8
in cells depleted of mH2A suppresses the proliferative advantage induced by mH2A loss.
Moreover, a significant inverse correlation between mH2A and CDK8 expression levels exists in
melanoma patient samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate that mH2A is a critical
component of chromatin that suppresses the development of malignant melanoma, a highly
intractable cutaneous neoplasm.
Histone variants replace conventional histones within the nucleosome and confer unique
biological functions to chromatin1, 7, 8. The H2A family is the most diverse and includes
vertebrate-specific mH2A1 (splice variants mH2A1.1 and 1.2) and mH2A21, 8-11, which
are generally associated with transcriptionally repressed chromatin12, 13. However, mH2A
is widely distributed throughout chromatin2-4 and exists in post-translationally modified
forms8, 14, suggesting additional unidentified functions for this variant.

Given increasing evidence for variant-mediated transcriptional control1, 8 and recent reports
describing variants as prognostic markers in cancer15, 16, we hypothesized that global
alteration of variants could contribute to malignant melanoma - the most lethal form of skin
cancer with rising incidence17, 18. Its radial growth phase (RGP) is characterized by lateral
melanocyte growth and vertical growth phase (VGP) by spread of melanoma cells into the
dermis and subcutis, upon which, metastasis can occur19.

Using well characterised, paired series of murine and human melanoma cells lines, we
probed the H2A variant profile. The murine B16 series represents cells of increasing
metastatic potential20 and the human series of a primary melanoma (WM115) and two
subsequent skin metastases derived from this same patient (WM266-4 and WM165-1)21. In
highly malignant cells of the murine and human series, a global decrease of mH2A1 and
mH2A2 protein and mRNA was observed (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. S1, S2). Analysis of
histones from both series using multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry (Q-MS)22
confirmed these findings (Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, mH2A1 and mH2A2 loss
was observed in a panel of primary and metastatic melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Interestingly, a 1.5 to 3-fold increase in H2A.Z levels (often associated with promoters of
active genes)1, 8 was also observed (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. S3), implicating possible
H2A variant exchange during melanoma progression. Consistent with a global loss of
mH2A and increased H2A.Z levels, we observed highly decondensed chromatin in B16-F10
cells by micrococcal nuclease digestion (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on ~115 human tissues ranging from
benign nevi to metastatic melanoma (Tissue set 1, Supplementary Fig. S4). mH2A2

antibody was used for IHC, as it produced clear nuclear staining, and tissues were
independently scored (0-3) by two blinded dermatopathologists with excellent inter-observer
consistency (Kappa = 0.80). IHC demonstrated that while mH2A2 is abundant in
melanocytes of benign nevi and RGP lesions, its expression is dramatically lost in >80% of
VGP and metastatic melanomas (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. S4). This suggests
mH2A loss occurs during the critical RGP-VGP transition. IHC was also performed on 25
melanomas with known BRAF status (D.P. unpublished data)23. An activating mutation of
BRAF, V600E, is present in approximately 65% of melanomas24. While this data set did
not reveal a significant correlation between mH2A2 loss and V600E mutation, it produced
similar mH2A2 results as the first cohort, as did a tissue microarray (Supplementary Fig.
S4). Using fresh tissues, we observed significantly reduced levels of mH2A1 and mH2A2
mRNA in metastatic melanoma specimens as compared to nevi and primary melanocytes
(Fig. 1c).

Author Manuscript

Due to the transcriptional downregulation of mH2A in human melanoma, combined with its
re-expression in metastatic melanoma cells upon 5-Aza-2′-Deoxycytidine treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S5), we hypothesized that DNA methylation may enable silencing of
mH2A. Indeed, through extensive bisulfite sequencing analysis, we identified a region of the
mH2A2 promoter that is significantly methylated in metastatic melanoma tissues and cell
lines, but not in primary melanocytes, WM115 cells, or benign nevi (Fig. 1d; Supplementary
Fig. S5).

Author Manuscript

Collectively, these findings prompted us to examine the functional consequences of mH2A
loss. We established multiple stable shRNA lines in murine B16-F0 and F1 and human
WM115 melanoma cells, targeting mH2A1, mH2A2, and control GFP (Supplementary Fig.
S6, 7). Two shRNA-transduced cell lines from mouse and human were utilized for in-depth
analysis: B16-F1 mH2A1_91 and mH2A2_25 and WM115 mH2A1_90 and mH2A2_05
(Supplementary Fig. S6, 7 for additional shRNA lines and isoform-specific knockdown).
Proliferation was examined in shRNA-expressing cells by colony formation and MTS cell
viability assays. The loss of mH2A increases proliferation of murine and human melanoma
cells (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. S6, 7), as well as anchorage-independent growth of
WM115 cells (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. S6). In order to examine growth potential in
vivo, B16-F1 shRNA cell lines were injected subcutaneously into mice; mH2A-deficient
cells exhibited significantly enhanced tumour growth compared to controls (Fig. 2c). mH2A
knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting lysates from tumours (Supplementary Fig.
S8).

Author Manuscript

Because cell motility contributes to metastasis and melanocytes originate from migratory
neural crest cells, shRNA lines were analyzed for migratory behaviour. Loss of mH2A in
murine and human cells enhanced migration through an 8μ trans-well and the ability to close
an artificial wound, as compared to control cells (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. S6, 7). Next,
shRNA cell lines were injected into the lateral tail veins of mice to assay metastatic
potential. Fourteen days post-injection, mice were sacrificed and lungs dissected for macroand microscopic histology (Fig. 2e). Lungs of mice injected with mH2A1_91 and
mH2A2_25 cells showed a five- and thirty-fold increase, respectively, in the number of

macroscopic metastases as lungs from control mice (Fig. 2e). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
and Ki-67 staining revealed metastatic disease with proliferation, respectively, in mH2A
shRNA-expressing tumours; mH2A knockdown in lungs was confirmed by IHC
(Supplementary Fig. S8).

Author Manuscript

Next, mH2A expression was stably restored in malignant B16-F10 and human WM266-4
and A375 cells. The core histone H2A, mH2A1 (1.2) and mH2A2 were fused to mCherry
and functional stable lines generated (Supplementary Fig. S9, 11, 13). Ectopic expression of
mH2A1.2 and mH2A2, but not H2A or mCherry alone, resulted in reduced proliferation
(without evidence of apoptosis) and migration (Supplementary Fig. S10, 12, 14). Human
A375 cells expressing the mCherry series were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of
immunocompromised mice; expression of mH2A1.2 and mH2A2 suppressed growth
(Supplementary Fig. S14). Furthermore, B16-F10 cells expressing mCherry fusions were
injected into tail veins of mice; mH2A1.2 and mH2A2 significantly suppressed metastasis to
the lungs (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. S10).

Author Manuscript

Given the striking phenotypes of mH2A manipulation in melanoma cells, we hypothesized
that loss of mH2A may alter the transcriptional state of proliferation- and metastasis-related
genes. We performed gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays with B16-F1
cells (mH2A1_91, mH2A2_25 and sh_GFP). As expected for mH2A’s role in fine-tuning of
gene expression2, many genes showed < 2-fold change, (Supplementary Fig. S15, 16 and 17
for Venn diagrams, heatmaps, and Gene Ontology). Fifteen genes showed ≥ 2-fold change,
common to both shRNA lines in two independent experiments, including Integrin alpha 4
(Itga4), transcriptional regulators CDK8 (Mediator complex component) and Cited1 (CBP/
p300 transactivator) (Fig. 3a). In concordance with our data, Itga4 expression is inversely
correlated with invasive potential of B16 cells25 and expression profiling of human
melanoma cells identified Cited1 loss in metastatic cells26. CDK8, however, is a new player
in melanoma malignancy.
In concordance, CDK8 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in both murine and human
cells depleted of mH2A (Fig. 3a-c), as well as subcutaneous tumours and lung metastases
derived from mH2A-deficient lines (Supplementary Fig. S18). Next we stably expressed
RNAi-resistant mH2A2 and H2A in the B16-F1 mH2A2_24 shRNA line, which targets the
3′UTR of mH2A2. While CDK8 levels remained high in mH2A2_24 cells expressing H2AmCherry, addition of mH2A-mCherry rescued CDK8 expression to B16-F1 levels (Fig. 3d).
Moreover, CDK8 was downregulated in subcutaneous tumours derived from A375 cells
expressing mH2A1- and mH2A2-mCherry (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. S14).

Author Manuscript

Intrigued by transcriptional up-regulation of CDK8, a colorectal cancer oncogene5,6, we
enquired if CDK8 is a direct target of mH2A. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
analysis demonstrated that the CDK8 promoter is enriched in mH2A1-containing
nucleosomes in B16-F1, but absent in B16-F10 cells and a control shRNA line (Fig. 3f,
Supplementary Fig. S18). ChIP analysis of additional mH2A target genes (but not an
intergenic locus or GAPDH) also revealed enrichment, and demonstrated that CDK8 is a
highly enriched mH2A target gene (Fig. 3f).

By examining a panel of human cell lines, we observed high CDK8 protein levels in
metastatic melanoma cells, comparable to that of colon cancer cells (Fig. 4a). We utilized
shRNAs to deplete CDK8 from B16-F10 and human A375 and WM165-1 cells, which
contain high levels of CDK8 (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. S19, 20). The loss of CDK8
significantly reduced proliferation (Fig. 4b) mediated by G2/M arrest in human cells
(Supplementary Fig. S20). Conversely, ectopic expression of CDK8 (and a kinase-defective
mutant, D173A)5 in B16-F1 cells resulted in significantly increased proliferation
(Supplementary Fig. S21). While proliferation in murine melanoma cells appears
independent of CDK8’s kinase activity, it may be consistent with recent studies
demonstrating a kinase-independent role of CDK827.

Author Manuscript

To dissect the relationship between mH2A and CDK8, we first depleted CDK8 in mH2A
shRNA-expressing cells (B16-F1 and WM115 lines). Knockdown of CDK8 was able to
suppress the enhanced proliferation induced by mH2A loss in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 4c, d;
Supplementary Fig. S21, S22). Knockdown of Med12, a subunit of the CDK8 submodule of
Mediator 27, showed a similar effect (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Fig. S22), suggesting that
CDK8 functions within the Mediator subcomplex in melanoma.

Author Manuscript

Next, we performed qRT-PCR of mH2A and CDK8 in 36 melanoma specimens. This
analysis demonstrated a statistically significant inverse correlation of mH2A2 and CDK8 at
the mRNA level (Pearson’s r= −0.406; p = 0.014; Fig. 4e). We performed IHC for CDK8 in
human tissues previously scored for mH2A2 (Kappa = 0.58), and observed strong CDK8
staining (scored 2-3) in a large fraction of mH2A2 negative (scored 0) melanomas (29/38=
76%; Supplementary Fig. S23). A similar trend was observed in a panel of human
melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S23). Finally, by probing fresh benign nevus
tissues, we observed high mH2A and low CDK8 protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S23).
Collectively, these results strongly suggest that CDK8 is a major effector of mH2Amediated melanoma progression.
Here, we demonstrate that mH2A is globally lost during melanoma progression. Similar
findings have recently been described in lung cancer; mH2A1.1 is enriched in pre-cancerous
senescent cells, but lost upon bypass of senescence16. However, the mechanism by which
this occurs and its biological consequences remain unclear. Our study suggests mH2A loss
in melanoma, mediated in part by DNA methylation, occurs after a potential senescence
bypass (i.e. in a nevus), but rather during the critical RGP to VGP transition. Nevertheless,
mH2A isoforms may serve as important biomarkers for melanoma, and/or other cancers.

Author Manuscript

The data presented here point towards a novel mechanism whereby CDK8 is regulated by
the unique histone variant mH2A. We look forward to future studies focused on CDK8
function and its inhibition in melanoma. Our findings support emerging links between
chromatin structure and cancer, and for the first time, demonstrate a direct role of mH2A in
this process.

Specimens were obtained from MSSM’s Division of Dermatopathology via Institutional
Review Board approval (Project # HSD08-00565) and NYU (IRB#10362). Primary RGP
melanoma (Breslow thickness <1.0mm) and VGP melanoma (Breslow thickness >1.0mm)
were examined. IHC was also performed on BRAF-genotyped melanoma (NYU) and
melanoma Tissue Microarray (Imgenex IMH-369). IHC performed as per manufacturer
instructions (Vector Laboratories, USA). In brief, five micron sections from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens were deparaffinized, incubated for antigen retrieval
with Vector Citrate-Based Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories H-3300) in
microwave for 10 min, exposed to 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase
activity, blocked with Vector Normal Horse Serum (2.5%) x 20 minutes, incubated with
mH2A211 (1:350-1:500) prepared in 0.1% BSA and incubated at 4°C overnight. Slides were
subsequently developed using Vector imPRESS Universal Kits Anti-Mouse/Rabbit Ig or
Anti-Goat Ig (Vector Laboratories MP-7500 or MP-7405), Vector DAB Peroxidase
Substrate Kit as the chromagen (Vector Laboratories SK-4100) and Harris Hematoxylin
(Sigma HHS32) for counterstaining. Slides then sealed and mounted with Permount (Sigma
SP15) and randomized for subsequent blinded review. Two independent
dermatopathologists (P.O.E. and C.I.V.) scored specimens for extent of melanocyte nuclear
staining (0- 3). Slides were compared with H&E sections and all slides stained with H3
(Abcam ab1791 or Millipore 05-928; both at 1:200) for tissue quality control. For CDK8
staining, mH2A negative melanomas were stained (Santa Cruz sc-1521; 1:200 and
sc-13155; 1:15), followed by randomization and scoring. All statistical analyses were
conducted using SPSS 14 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago). Average staining score was used
for analyses and inter-observer consistency between dermatopathologists assessed with
Kappa-Coefficient. Statistical significance of mH2A2 scores first assessed using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test, followed by two-sided MannWhitney U-tests.

(stably transduced with sh_GFP, mH2A1_91 and mH2A2_25 shRNA) and 1.5 ×105 B16F10 cells (stably transduced with mCherry, H2A-mCherry, mH2A1.2- and mH2A2mCherry) were injected intravenously in BALB/c mice. Mice injected with B16-F1 cells
were sacrificed 14 or 21 days post-infection (performed in duplicate with similar results; 6-8
mice per group). Mice injected with B16-F10 cells were sacrificed 10 days post-injection

(n= 6-9 per group). Lungs were removed and fixed, isolated and discrete pigmented lung
surface lesions were counted. For subcutaneous injections, 2.5×105 of B16-F1 cells stably
infected with shRNAs were injected in the flanks of 6-week old C57BL/6J mice (Jackson
Laboratories). Mice were injected (6-9 per group) and measurements taken over 12-14 days.
2×106 A375 cells expressing mCherry series were injected into NOG mice (NOD/Shi-scid/
IL-2Rγnull, Jackson Laboratories), and measurements taken over 21 days. Tumour volume
estimated by V = (a2 × b)/2 where a is the short axis and b is the long axis of the tumour.
Tissues from all assays were paraffin-embedded and 5μm sections H&E stained.
Experiments were conducted under protocol #080901-01 approved by NYU Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis

Microarray samples were processed in the Microarray Shared Research Facility at MSSM
and performed on two biological replicates. Total RNA was isolated from cells using
RNeasy column purification per manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). The quality of the RNA
was evaluated using the Agilent BioAnalyzer RNA nano assay. Briefly, 150ng of total RNA
was reverse transcribed using T7-poly(dT) primer and converted into double-stranded
cDNA. The cDNA was used as a template for subsequent in vitro transcription with biotinlabeled UTP at 37°C for 16 h using Genechip 3′ IVT express kit (Affymetrix). The resulting
biotin-labeled cDNA was chemically fragmented, made into hybridization cocktail and
hybridized to the Mouse Genome 430 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) according to the
Affymetrix GeneChip protocol. The array images were generated through a high-resolution
GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix), then converted to digitized data based on MAS
5.0 within the GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS). Spike-in controls and percentage of
present (‘P’) call generated were used for data quality control. Data analysis was performed
as follows: Normalization – All chip data was scaled to have an average signal intensity of
150. Comparison analysis- Comparison analysis based on MAS 5 was performed for each
pair (sh_GFP compared to mH2A1_91 and sh_GFP compared to mH2A2_25) on both data
sets. The compared data was subjected to the following arbitrary filters to improve data
reliability: 1) Detection call – only probes that had at least one ‘P’ call in the pair were
retained. 2) Signal intensity – only probes that showed signal intensity ≥ 100 in at least one
of the pair were retained. 3) Fold change – probes that showed log fold-change ≥ 2 in at least
one data set were retained for further analysis. 4) Concordance analysis was performed to
reduce false positive selection between shRNA lines and the two independent microarray
experiments: direction and fold-change in gene regulation had to be 100% match to qualify
as altered genes. Gene list was annotated by submission to Netaffx annotation center within
Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com), which periodically updates the integrated
information for each gene across multiple public genome databases.
Hierarchical clustering, generation of heat maps and GO analysis
A portion of the filtered subset of data was used for additional analysis. Cluster Analysis
was performed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the log-transformed data with
Gene Cluster 3.0 (http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/index.html) by
using the correlation (uncentered) similarity metric and centeroid linkage clustering method.

The resulting tree-images were visualized using Java TreeView. GO analysis was performed
using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources30 (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp).
Quantitative PCR and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription performed with
SuperScript II (Invitrogen) using oligo dT. qPCR reactions performed in triplicate on
Stratagene Opticon 2 using Fast start SYBR Green Mix (Roche). Expression levels
normalized to TATA Binding Protein (TBP) in mouse cells and GAPDH in human cells; or
relative to B16-F1 sh_GFP for gene target expression. Each qPCR performed using two
independent biological replicates. Primer sets used for qRT-PCR listed in Supplementary
Table 2. ChIP assays performed using Magna ChIP™ Kit (Protein G; Millipore) as per
manufacturer’s instructions. IPs performed with antibodies against mH2A1 (Millipore
07-219), H3 (Abcam ab1791), and control IgG (Millipore 12-370). ChIP signal represented
as percentage of H3; calculated by 100 × 2^(CtH3-CtAntibody). Primers used for ChIP-qPCR
are listed in Supplementary Table 3.
