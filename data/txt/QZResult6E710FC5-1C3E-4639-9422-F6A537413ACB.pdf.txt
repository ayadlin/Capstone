ABSTRACT
Treating pancreatic cancer is extremely challenging due to multiple factors,
including chemoresistance and poor disease prognosis. Chemoresistance can be
explained by: the presence of a dense stromal barrier leading to a lower vascularized
condition, therefore limiting drug delivery; the huge intra-tumoral heterogeneity;
and the status of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These factors are highly
variable between patients making it difficult to predict responses to chemotherapy.
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) is the main enzyme responsible
for recycling cytosolic NAD+ in hypoxic conditions. FK866 is a noncompetitive
specific inhibitor of NAMPT, which has proven anti-tumoral effects, although a
clinical advantage has still not been demonstrated. Here, we tested the effect of
FK866 on pancreatic cancer-derived primary cell cultures (PCCs), both alone and in
combination with three different drugs typically used against this cancer: gemcitabine,
5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin. The aims of this study were to evaluate the
benefit of drug combinations, define groups of sensitivity, and identify a potential
biomarker for predicting treatment sensitivity. We performed cell viability tests in the
presence of either FK866 alone or in combination with the drugs above-mentioned.
We confirmed both inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Interestingly, only the in
vitro effect of gemcitabine was influenced by the addition of FK866. We also found
that NAMPT mRNA expression levels can predict the sensitivity of cells to FK866.
Overall, our results suggest that patients with tumors sensitive to FK866 can be
identified using NAMPT mRNA levels as a biomarker and could therefore benefit from
a co-treatment of gemcitabine plus FK866.

INTRODUCTION

inhibits growth of various kinds of cancer cells, with
no effect on normal cells [8]. It causes cellular death
by apoptosis [11] and induces autophagy. Its effects on
autophagy are potentiated by chloroquine and antagonized
by 3-methyladenine or by down-regulating autophagyrelated proteins [12, 13]. Interestingly, NAMPT inhibition
sensitizes pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells to tumorselective, PAR-independent metabolic catastrophe and
cell death induced by β-lapachone [14] and FK866 led to
either tumor regression or stabilization in a preclinical trial
[11]. However, in five clinical trials testing three specific
NAMPT inhibitors (FK866, CHS828 and GMZ1777), no
significant tumor remission was observed in a total of 104
patients. Clinical studies on FK866 have revealed that due
to its short half-life in circulation, prolonged treatment
regimens are required, inducing toxicity to proliferating
hematopoietic cells. Therefore, the efficiency of NAD+
depleting drugs, such as NAMPT inhibitors, when used
alone are expected to be low due to insufficient tumorselectivity [15-17]. For this reason, FK866 has also
been tested as an additive drug to other well-known
chemotherapies. It increased the chemosensitivity
of gastric cancer cells to 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) [18],
potentiated the effects of cisplatin and etoposide in
neuroblastoma cell lines [13] and massively reduced the
overall metabolic activity in xenografts, impairing PDAC
growth [19].
Combining drugs to treat chemoresistant cancers,
such as PDAC, subsequently became a promising
alternative. The best example in PDAC was the advent of
Folfirinox (5FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) that produced
the longest improvement in survival ever seen in a phase
III clinical trial of patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer [20, 21]. This drug combination led to increased
cell death, a reduction of drug resistance, while allowing
the use of lower doses and therefore fewer side effects.
Here, we sought to increase the efficiency of killing
pancreatic cancer cells via an association of drugs which
target two different cellular processes (i.e.: metabolism
and genomic stability). We investigated the effect of the
NAMPT inhibitor, FK866, on PDAC-derived primary cell
cultures (PCCs) and determined whether it can potentiate
the effects of three frequently used chemotherapeutical
agents: gemcitabine, 5FU and oxaliplatin. We also
attempted to determine groups of sensitivity to these
drug combinations and identify a screening biomarker
(companion test) capable of predicting this sensitivity.

Treating patients with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a challenge due to the
poor prognosis of this disease and its resistance to
chemotherapies. This can be partially attributed to a dense
stroma barrier surrounding the tumor and the lack of
vessels, which decrease drug delivery to the tumor site,
also limiting access to oxygen and nutrients [1]. PDACs
also present epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the
presence of cancer stem cells is a sign of aggressiveness
and chemoresistance [2]. Chemoresistance is particularly
difficult to overcome due to genetic heterogeneity both
between pancreatic tumors, and within each tumor. These
factors can render patients completely unresponsive to a
given chemotherapy and in those cases that do respond
the selection of resistant clones within the tumor can
cause cancer relapse. Hypoxic conditions and limited
access to nutrients induce cancerous cells to adapt
their metabolism to survive and grow in this hostile
environment [3]. One of the mechanisms activated is the
Warburg’s effect, characterized by increased glycolysis
and lactate overproduction. This process, is also known
as aerobic glycolysis and promotes tumor growth [4]. The
high rates of aerobic glycolysis perturb NAD+ metabolism,
altering the NADH/NAD+ redox ratio. Indeed, instead
of eventually transferring electrons from NADH to the
mitochondrial respiratory chain, a large proportion of
cytosolic NAD+ is regenerated by reducing pyruvate
to lactate. NAD+ is an essential coenzyme involved in
numerous metabolic pathways and energy transduction
of nearly every cell. It mediates signaling events and
participates in the regulation of many biological processes,
including transcription, cell cycle progression, apoptosis,
DNA repair and metabolic regulation [5]. Cellular
NAD+ levels have been recognized as a homeostatic
process with immediate effects on cellular metabolism. A
stable level is maintained by a finely regulated balance
between NAD+ degradation, NAD+ synthesis and NAD+
recycled through a salvage pathway. Pancreatic cancer
cells rely heavily on the NAD+ salvage pathway for their
metabolism. Two enzymes which play major roles in this
pathway are nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase
(NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl
transferase (NMNAT1) [6, 7]. NAMPT is the most active
enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step of nicotinamide
condensation with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate
to yield nicotinamide mononucleotide, then NMNAT1,
leading to NAD+ from nicotinamide mononucleotide and
ATP. NAMPT is up-regulated in a number of solid tumors
and is involved in angiogenesis by inducing vascular
endothelial growth factor [8, 9].
FK866 is a noncompetitive highly specific
inhibitor of NAMPT and clinically interesting as it is
a potent antitumor drug both in vitro and in vivo [10].
Many recent studies provide evidence that it selectively

number of operated patients was observed due to the
fact that xenografts from surgical specimens grow better
than biopsies. PCCs were obtained from patient-derived
xenografts in nude mice. These cells were submitted to
increasing concentrations of FK866 (from 0 to 1000 nM)
to determine their sensitivity by plotting dose-response
curves. We established a chemogram (i.e.: determination
of the cell viability as a function of the chemotherapeutic
drug concentration) for each patient-derived PCC. Using
this approach we were able to estimate their relative
chemosensitivity by comparing their half maximal
inhibitory concentrations (IC50s). Notably, the three
PCCs most sensitive to FK866 were: HN-01 (IC50 = 0.41
nM), 01.030 (IC50 = 0.30 nM) and C-NOR (IC50 = 0.85
nM), whereas 02.058, HN-03 and AD-IPC were the three
most resistant, all with IC50s > 1000 nM (Figure 1a). This
manner of analyzing data could not determine scores for
those PCCs that did not achieve an IC50, even at very high
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

FK866 concentrations. We observed maximal variability
in the sensitivity of PCCs to FK866 at a concentration of
3.9 nM. We next decided to score the PCCs sensitivity
based on cell viability following treatment with 3.9 nM
FK866 (Figure 1b). HN-01, 01.030 and C-NOR remained
the most sensitive PCCs, however the most resistant
were: L-NOR, AR-IPC and E-NOR. We used this scoring
method for the next experiments in this study. Overall,
our data reveals that each PDAC-derived PCC has its own
sensitivity to FK866 with a huge range of IC50s (from
0.30 to >1000 nM), suggesting a very high response
variability among patients. Importantly, the dose-response
curves depict a cell viability plateau for almost every
PCC, even with high doses of FK866, indicating intratumoral heterogeneity in terms of sensitivity to the FK866
treatment (Figure 1). As sensitivity to FK866 could be
associated with PCC replication time, this was calculated
and analyzed. Doubling times varied between 16.46±5.33h
53785

for L-IPC and 44.63±6.07h for 02.087p (Supplementary
Figure 1). All PCCs actively replicate during the time of
chemosensitivity determination and no correlation was
observed between doubling time and FK866 sensitivity
and between doubling time and NAMPT expression level
(data not shown). We also analyzed clinical characteristics
of FK866 sensitive and resistant patients and we did not
find any correlation.

using the 4 most sensitive PCCs to FK866 (01.030,
C-NOR, L-IPC and HN-01). A combination of 0.06 nM
FK866 with different gemcitabine concentrations had no
significant effect on cell viability (Figure 2a). However,
3.9 nM FK866 significantly decreased cell viability in
all 4 sensitive PCCs tested. We therefore concluded that
treatment with 3.9 nM FK866 can enhance the effect
of gemcitabine, which was not observed at the lower
concentration (0.06 nM). The PrestoBlue method we
used to measure cell viability is based on mitochondrial
activity (see Material and Methods). As FK866 could
influence mitochondrial activity, potentially inducing
misinterpretation of data, we decided to compare results
obtained with PrestoBlue™ with another method that
measures living cells by their protease activity (CellTiterFluor™). As shown in Figure 2b, the 6 PCCs tested (HN03, J-IPC, 01.030, C-NOR, Foie 8B and AD-IPC) using
two concentrations of FK866 (1 and 3.9 nM), confirmed
that results obtained with PrestoBlue™ and CellTiterFluor™ are not significantly different. Therefore all
measurements of cell viability were subsequently carried
out using the PrestoBlue™ method. We next analyzed

FK866 increases sensitivity to gemcitabine, but
not 5FU or oxaliplatin, in a group of PCCs from
PDAC patients
In order to study FK866 in combination with other
drugs, we tested two different FK866 concentrations
(0.06 and 3.9 nM) with a series of 11 increasing
concentrations of three genotoxic drugs (5FU, oxaliplatin
and gemcitabine). We selected a concentration of 0.06
nM FK866 as this was the maximal dose that caused a
minimal effect in all cells tested. Conversely, the dose of
3.9 nM caused the most variable effect between the 23
PCCs (see Figure 1). We decided to continue the study

the effect of combining FK866 with gemcitabine on 7
PCCs that show different degrees of resistance to FK866
(01.001, 01.033, J-IPC, Foie 8B, AR-IPC, 02.058 and
02.087) and observed an important heterogeneity (Figure
3). For PCCs 01.001, 01.033 and J-IPC, there was a clear
synergistic effect of combining the drugs, which was not
apparent for the PCCs AR-IPC, 02.058, 02.087 and Foie
8B. Most of the PCCs tested (8 out of 11 PCCs) were more
sensitive to this co-treatment.
In another set of experiments, 5FU and oxaliplatin
were both combined with FK866 at either 0.06 or 3.9 nM.
Figure 4 shows results obtained using the PCCs Foie 8B,
01.030, J-IPC and HN-03. Curiously, a combination of
NAMPT inhibitor with either 5FU or oxaliplatin resulted
in no significant effect, with the exception of 01.030,
although only at high concentrations of oxaliplatin
(15.6 and 62.5 nM). Interestingly, neither 5FU nor
oxaliplatin are clinically used as a monotherapy since
they have proven to be almost non-effective, contrary to
gemcitabine. Therefore, addition of FK866 could be more

advantageous in combination with gemcitabine treatment
instead of 5FU or oxaliplatin.

NAMPT transcriptional level predicts FK866
sensitivity
Next, we hypothesized that NAMPT, as a specific
target of FK866, could predict drug sensitivity. We
therefore quantified NAMPT at the transcriptional level
in PCCs by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). We
plotted the mRNA expression level in arbitrary units from
0 to 15 (Figure 5a) and used IC50 values to reflect and
compare the global sensitivity of PCCs. As shown in
Figure 5a, all PCCs expressing over 2 arbitrary units of
NAMPT presented IC50s > 3.9nM. On the contrary, only
53% of PCCs (8 out of 15) showed IC50s > 3.9 nM with
an NAMPT expression level of less than 2 arbitrary units.
Therefore, our results indicate that resistance to FK866
positively correlates with the expression level of NAMPT
transcript. In Figure 5b we plotted results obtained by a

regression analysis between NAMPT mRNA expression
and FK866 IC50 in PCCs. We observed a positive
correlation, indicating that PCCs which express higher
levels of NAMPT have an increased resistance to FK866
treatment. These results strongly suggest that the primary
culture of pancreatic epithelial cells does not significantly
modify NAMPT transcriptional expression. In some
cases we observed PCCs (especially E-NOR or AD-IPC)
with low NAMPT mRNA expression and high resistance
to FK866, we have no clear explanation for that but we
observed that in all cases highly NAMPT expressing cells
have IC50>3.9. We also analyzed the putative association
between patient survival Vs NAMPT expression and Vs
FK866 sensitivity and we did not find any correlation.
We analyzed other clinical characteristics in particular

differentiation status of xenograft and we did not find any
association.

Metabolic status of PDAC-derived cells does not
correlate with NAMPT expression level
NAD+ is a coenzyme which plays an essential
role in metabolism within tumoral cells. Its synthesis is
accomplished by a salvage pathway implicating NAMPT.
Since NAMPT expression level and sensitivity to FK866
correlate, we hypothesized that tumoral cells with a
high metabolism, i.e consuming or producing more
metabolites with higher levels of NAMPT, would die at
a faster rate than metabolically neutral cells. We therefore
analyzed the relationships between either NAMPT
expression or FK866 sensitivity with glucose/glutamine

However, we observed no correlation between this benefit
of combined treatment and NAMPT expression levels.
We then analyzed the effect of FK866 alone or combined
with gemcitabine on the intracellular levels of NAD+ (see
Material and Methods). As shown in Figure 7C, 02.058
and AR-IPC cells which are resistant to FK866 and do
not show any decrease in their viability after gemcitabine
+ FK866 treatment present high NAD+ levels in all
conditions (treated or not with FK866 or with FK866 +
gemcitabine). Differently, cells resistant to FK866 and
with a decrease in their viability after combined treatment
FK866+gemcitabine (J-IPC, 01.033) as well as FK866
sensitive cells (HN-01 and C-NOR) show low levels of
NAD+ in all conditions. We finally examined clinical
characteristics of patients that could take advantage of
a combined treatment against the others and we did not
find any common characteristic between them. Overall,
these results suggest that most PDAC patients could take

treatments with gemcitabine alone versus gemcitabine
plus FK866 in all 23 PCCs. Gemcitabine was used at a
concentration of 62.5 μM, demonstrated to be efficient in
the chemograms, and FK866 at 3.9 nM (Figure 7a). As
shown in Figure 7b, the combined treatment (gemcitabine

addition, quantification of NAMPT mRNA expression
could be used as a potential biomarker for determining
the sensitivity of tumors to FK866, despite NAMPT
levels not predicting a benefit of a combined treatment of
gemcitabine-FK866. Interestingly high NAD+ levels seem
to designate cells that will not present a decrease in cell

patients by characterizing tumors at the molecular level.
The results presented in this paper have revealed a
group of tumors that appear more sensitive to FK866,
a specific inhibitor of NAMPT. An interesting aspect of
this work is the efficient strategy we employed to include
23 consecutive patients with PDAC tumors in the study
by collecting samples from both surgical specimens and
EUS-FNA biopsies and preserving them as xenografts in
immunosuppressed mice. We studied NAMPT mRNA
expression profiles of these patient-derived PCCs using
RT-qPCR and found a correlation between NAMPT
expression and sensitivity to FK866. Finally, and most
importantly, we discovered that FK866 improves the
effect of gemcitabine in vitro, although not 5FU or
oxaliplatin.

DISCUSSION
The main aims of this study were to define
whether there are differences in sensitivity of PDACs
to a metabolic drug either alone or in combination; and
if so, to determine a way to identify the most sensitive

NAMPT is a fascinating target for the
chemotherapeutic treatment of PDAC for a number of
reasons Firstly, the recycling of NAD+ is vital for cancer
cells due to a high need of ADP ribosylation to repair
DNA, preserve genome stability, and maintain telomeres
[22]. This is why NAD+ dependence renders cancer cells
more sensitive to NAMPT inhibition than normal cells.
Secondly, NAMPT allows NAD+ synthesis by a salvage
pathway in a dose dependent manner, and NAMPT is
known to be increased in several cancers [23]. Finally,
NAD+ synthesis is increased by DNA damage in primary
culture cells [24].
FK866 is an interesting compound since its
mechanism of action is well established and several
clinical trials have been performed in patients with
different cancers, including several solid tumors. Previous
studies indicate that metabolic reprogramming is not only
the consequence of cancer cells proliferation and growth;
it is a direct function of oncogenesis and consequently
an oncogenesis motor [25, 26]. Cancer cells are also
NAD-dependent as NAD+ is an important cofactor in the
oxidative phosphorylation chain as well as a substrate for
enzymes involved in genomic stability, apoptosis, cell
signaling, stress tolerance and metabolism. NAMPT is the
main enzyme responsible for maintaining NAD+ levels in
tumors and may be the “Achilles’ heel” to study for future
chemotherapy.
An important point to note from our study is that
the IC50 for FK866 in patient-derived PCCs varied
greatly from 0.295 nM to >1000 nM. A group of patients
expressing high levels of NAMPT mRNA were relatively
resistant to the treatment with FK866 suggesting that
its expression was not completely inhibited by FK866,
perhaps for a stoichiometric reason. Accordingly, we
found that PCCs expressing intermediary or lower levels
of NAMPT mRNA were frequently associated with
higher levels of sensitivity to the treatment with FK866.
We hypothesize that this group with higher sensitivity is
dependent on NAMPT levels and the amount expressed
by the cell can be inhibited by FK866. Altogether, our data
suggest that levels of NAMPT in human tumors can be
used to predict sensitivity to FK866 treatment. Consistent
with this, it has been previously suggested that NAMPT
expression could play a role in the response to FK866
[5, 19]. For example, on fibrosarcoma cells NAMPT
overexpression has been shown to protect cells against
FK866 treatment [27]. Furthermore, NAMPT inhibition
using a siRNA in the presence of GMX1778, another
NAMPT inhibitor, increased apoptosis of different cancer
cells. In addition, NAMPT expression showed an inverse
correlation to GMX1778 toxicity [28].
It is unlikely that NAMPT inhibition would be
solely used as a therapeutic approach for treating patients
with a PDAC since FK866 at high concentrations is very
toxic, as anticipated from its mechanism of action which
affects basic functions of both cancerous and normal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells. Therefore, the only possibility is to use FK866 in
combination with cytotoxic drugs to potentiate their
effect. Accordingly, the second point to be noted from this
work is the significant potentiation of gemcitabine on cell
viability by co-treatment with FK866, yet surprisingly, this
added benefit was almost negligible when combined with
5FU or oxaliplatin. This was unexpected since previous
studies have shown a potentiation of the effects of 5FU by
FK866 on gastric cancer cells and of cisplatin by FK866
on neuroblastoma cells [13, 18]. These results suggest
that the enhancement of the effects of cytotoxic drugs
by FK866 is most likely dependent on cancer cell type.
Moreover intracellular NAD+ depletion after cell treatment
with FK866 induces autophagy [12, 29]. VMP1-Mediated
Autophagy is also induced by gemcitabine promoting
apoptosis [30]. Both effects could be additive increasing
cell death and explaining the synergistic effect of FK866
and gemcitabine. Another putative explanation could be
that gemcitabine induces the DNA damage response and in
consequence PARP-1 activity [31]. PARP-1 needs NAD+
as a substrate for auto poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation)
and activation. PARPs are highly responsive proteins; their
enzymatic activity can increase up to 500-fold after DNA
consuming up to 80–90% of the intracellular NAD+ stores
[32]. As NAD+ in depleted by FK866 treatment, PARP1 could become inactive and thus increase the effect of
gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer cells. On another hand
differently to gemcitabine, autophagy induction protects
cancer cells against oxaliplatin and 5FU-induced cell death
[33, 34]. This could explain the absence of synergistic
effect combining Oxaliplatin and 5FU with FK866 on
pancreatic cancer primary cultures.
FK866 has been shown to exert strong effects
on cancer cell metabolism, such as glycolysis,
pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle,
serine biosynthesis and attenuating glycolysis at the
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step due to
reduced availability of NAD+ for the enzyme [35]. We
therefore hypothesized that FK866 could be more efficient
in tumors with increased glycolysis or glutaminolysis.
However, contrary to this we were unable to demonstrate a
correlation between either glucose/glutamine consumption
or lactate/glutamate production and sensitivity levels of
PCCs to FK866 treatment. This suggests that pancreatic
cancer cell metabolism is not mandatory to the sensitivity
to FK866 treatment. Nevertheless some particular points
are worth discussing, in particular the one observed for the
L-IPC tumor that presents the highest lactate production.
This patient was diagnosed with an anaplastic carcinoma
of the pancreas, one of the most aggressive forms of
pancreatic cancer and his survival time after diagnosis was
of only 5.28 month. On the other hand J-IPC presents one
of the highest survival times in this cohort (25.74 months).
These two cases represent interesting but only isolated
observations and more of these uncommon patients would
be necessary to include in the study in order to draw solid

conclusions about pancreatic cancer aggressiveness and
metabolism.
Finally, we tested the efficiency of NAMPT in
depleting NAD+ (Figure 7c). Cells presenting higher
basal levels of NAD+, also presented elevated levels of
NAD+ after FK866 and FK866 + gemcitabine treatments.
Interestingly FK866 sensitive and resistant cells showing
a decreased viability after gemcitabine treatment also
showed lower levels of NAD+ before and after the
different treatments, suggesting that basal levels of
NAD+ in pancreatic tumoral cells could predict if the
patient will take advantage of a combined FK866 and
gemcitabine treatement. Tumoral cells with high NAD+
basal levels should be resistant to FK866 and did not
show any decrease in viability with a combination FK866
+ gemcitabine in contrast to FK866 alone.
In addition, our results present a clinical interest
since RT-qPCR for measuring NAMPT mRNA expression
can be routinely performed either on systematic echoendoscopy-guided biopsies at diagnosis or on specimens
after surgery. A simple and reproducible test to predict
the sensitivity of a tumor to FK866 would greatly aid
clinicians in their daily decisions of treatment. With lower
doses of combined drugs, patients would be partly spared
from side effects while receiving an appropriate and
personalized treatment. Patients needing gemcitabine to
treat a metastatic or an operated PDAC could therefore
benefit from a co-treatment of FK866-gemcitabine.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that: the IC50 of
FK866 to kill PCCs varied more than 4000 fold between
sensitive and resistant cells; sensitivity to FK866 is
dependent on an optimal cellular level of NAMPT mRNA
expression which could be exploited as a companion test
to select suitable patients for treatment; and finally, FK866
potentiates the effect of gemcitabine on PDAC-derived
PCCs.

To obtain primary cell cultures of these tumors,
xenografts were split into several small pieces and
processed in a biosafety chamber: after a fine mincing,
they were treated with collagenase type V (ref C9263;
Sigma) and trypsin/EDTA (ref 25200-056; Gibco, Life
Technologies) and suspended in DMEM supplemented
with 1% w/w penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Life
Technologies) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonza).
After centrifugation, cells were re-suspended in serum
free ductal media (SFDM) adapted from Schreiber et al.
[36] without antibiotic and incubated at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 incubator. Primary cultured cells were splitted many
times until obtaining 4x107 cells (representing 20 vials
with 2x106 cells each). This was considered passage zero.
At this stage only human cancerous epithelial cells were
present in the culture. Cells were then splitted a maximum
of 6 more times to avoid other alterations associated with
passages. Mouse contaminant cells do not replicate any
more after a few passages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Viability assays

Chemograms
Cells were screened for their chemosensitivity to
FK866 (Sigma-Aldrich, France). They were grown in
SFDM without nicotinamide for 72 h. Five thousand cells
per well were plated in 96-well plates in SFDM medium
without nicotinamide. Twenty-four hours later the media
was supplemented with increasing concentrations of
FK866 and incubated for an additional 72 h period. Each
experiment was done in triplicate and repeated at least two
times. These cells were treated for 72 h with increasing
concentrations of FK866 ranging from 0 to 1000 nM
(in a progression by a factor4). FK866 was next tested
at a given concentration in association with increasing
concentrations of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin or 5FU (0 to
1000 μM).

Cell viability was estimated after addition of
PrestoBlue™ reagent (Life Technologies) for 3 h,
following the PrestoBlue™ cell viability reagent protocol
provided by the supplier. Live-cell protease activity
was also measured using CellTiter-fluor™ (Promega,
France). For both techniques cell viability was measured
by fluorescence. FK866 sensitivity was close for each
primary cell culture if cell viability was estimated with
either PrestoBlue™ or CellTiter-Fluor™. PrestoBlue™
monitors mitochondrial function alteration as an indicator
of cellular necrosis and apoptosis. Cells with an active
metabolism reduce resazurin to resorufin due to NADPH,
FADH and NADH electrons. It causes a color change
detected by fluorometry. Following the strategy published
in 2013, cell viability was measured using CellTiterFluor™ as an alternative and unrelated method [37]. Since

PDAC samples and cell culture
Consent forms of informed patients were collected
and registered in a central database. The tumor tissues
used for xenograft development were deemed excess to
that required for the patient’s diagnosis. Two types of
samples were obtained: endoscopic ultrasound-guided
fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsies from patients
with unresectable tumors; and tumor tissues from
patients undergoing surgery. A total of 23 patients were
included, all without treatment before biopsy or surgery.
PDAC samples were mixed with 100 μl of matrigel (BD
Biosciences) and implanted with a trocar (10 Gauge,
Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) into the
subcutaneous right upper flank of an anesthetized and
disinfected mouse. When tumors reached 1 cm3, mice
were sacrificed and tumors removed.

NAD+ was measured using the NAD+/
NADH™ bioluminescent Assay (Promega). Cells
were chosen according to their response to FK866 and
FK866+Gemcitabine treatments. 3 groups: 1-cells resistant
to FK866 that do not present any differences in viability
when treated additionally with gemcitabine (02.058; ARIPC); 2-Cells that are resistant to FK866 and that present a
decrease in viability when treated with gemcitabine (J-IPC;
01.033) and 3-cells that are sensitive to FK866 and that
show a decreased viability when treated with gemcitabine
(HN-01; C-NOR) see Figures 2 and 3. Five thousand
cells were seeded in each well of 96 well-plates, culture
medium used was Nicotinamide-free SFDM. Twenty-four
hours after plating, culture media was supplemented with
3.9nM FK866 or a combination of 3.9nM FK866 and
62.5μM Gemcitabine. NAD+ was measured twenty-four
hours later. NAD+ values were normalized according to
viable cell number after treatment.
