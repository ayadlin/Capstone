BACKGROUND: Germ cell tumors (GCTs) primarily affect adolescent and young adult men. Detailed clinical and treatment characteristics in older men are lacking. METHODS: Patients with GCT seen over a 20-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
were identified. Primary tumor site and histology were compared for patients aged  50 years at diagnosis versus younger men. For
patients aged  50, individual chart review was performed and treatment delays, changes, and toxicities were recorded for those
treated with first-line chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of 4235 diagnoses of GCT, 3999 (94.4%) were made at age < 50 versus 236 (5.6%) at
age  50. Compared with patients diagnosed before age 50, older men more frequently had seminoma (62.7% versus 36.7%) and less
frequently, nonseminoma (34.7% versus 63.2%) (P <.0001). Predominant histology switched from nonseminoma to seminoma around
age 35. Distribution of primary sites also differed for older versus younger men (testis: 89.4% versus 92.9%; retroperitoneal: 3.8% versus 0.7%; CNS 0% versus 1.7%) except for mediastinal primary tumors, which remained constant across age groups. Fifty patients
age  50 received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy; 30 experienced complications leading to treatment discontinuation,
delay  7 days, or regimen change. Twenty-two (44%) patients experienced neutropenic fever, 6 despite prophylactic growth factor
support. Estimated 5-year survival for chemotherapy-treated patients was 84.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Men aged  50 years comprise less
than 10% of GCT diagnoses and have distinct clinical and histological characteristics as compared with younger patients. Although
complications from chemotherapy occur frequently in older men, prognosis remains excellent when risk-directed treatment is adminC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Germ cell tumors (GCTs) primarily affect adolescent and young adult men, with diagnoses in older patients, children,
and women occurring much less commonly. In men, most GCTs arise in the testis but extragonadal primary tumor sites
comprise up to 10% of cases, typically in midline locations such as the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, or pineal gland.
The World Health Organization classification of tumors1 categorizes GCTs in adolescents and adults into 3 histologic
groups: classic seminoma with pure histology; nonseminomatous GCT (NSGCT), comprising embryonal carcinoma,
yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, teratoma, and mixed histologies (which can include seminoma); and spermatocytic
seminoma.2 In most epidemiological studies, rates of seminoma slightly exceed those of NSGCT,3,4 with spermatocytic
seminoma comprising < 1% of cases. The incidence of seminoma and NSGCT differs across age groups, peaking between
ages 35 and 39 years for seminoma compared with 25 to 29 years for NSGCT.4 Nevertheless, both histologic types are
rare in older men with fewer than 10% and 2% of cases diagnosed at age  50 and  65, respectively.4
Because of the infrequency of GCT in men aged  50 years, few studies have focused on this population. As such,
detailed clinical characteristics, treatment tolerability, and outcome data for older GCT patients are lacking. This study
sought to characterize the distribution of histology, primary site, and stage among GCT patients diagnosed at age  50

Features and Outcome of Older Men With GCT/Feldman et al

compared to younger patients and to investigate outcome
and safety in older patients receiving first-line cisplatinbased chemotherapy for advanced disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Using our institutional tumor registry, we identified all
men with a GCT diagnosis seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between January 1, 1990,
and December 31, 2010. Patients who had pathology-only
consultations were not included. For each case, we reviewed
age (at diagnosis and initial evaluation), primary tumor
site, and histology, as per the International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) code in our tumor registry. ICD-O coding was based on pathologic review of tumor specimens at MSKCC. ICD-O versions 1, 2, and 3
were used to code patients during years 1990 to 1991,
1992 to 2000, and 2001 to 2010, respectively. Histologies
were regrouped into categories of seminoma, nonseminoma, spermatocytic seminoma, or “GCT, not otherwise
specified” where histologic differentiation between seminoma and nonseminoma was not possible. Follow-up and
survival data were determined using electronic records as
well as the US Social Security Death Index. This study was
approved by the MSKCC Institutional Review Board.
Our analysis consisted of 3 components. First, we
investigated whether the distribution of GCT histology
and primary tumor sites differed by age of diagnosis
(eg, < 50 years versus  50 years) using the Pearson’s chisquare test. Second, we performed individual chart review
on patients seen for initial management at MSKCC at
age  50 years (regardless of age at diagnosis), documenting American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)5 stage
and initial postorchiectomy or (for extragonadal primary
tumors) postdiagnosis management approach (chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, or surveillance). Third,
patients  50 years of age at the time of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy at MSKCC were risk-classified
according to International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG)6 criteria. Each patient’s first-line
chemotherapy course was reviewed to identify: 1) treatment delays, defined as postponement  7 days for complication(s) caused by the prior cycle; 2) early treatment
discontinuation or changes in regimen prompted by toxicity; and 3) episodes of neutropenic fever.
We examined survival (time from initial diagnosis to
death or last follow-up) for the overall population and for
each patient subset defined above, using the Kaplan-Meier
method.7 Forty men had bilateral testicular GCT.
Because contralateral testicular GCT is considered a second primary malignancy, we performed our analyses on a

There were 4235 diagnoses in 4195 patients because 40 patients had 2
separate diagnoses (bilateral testicular GCT), including 38 with both diagnoses at <50 years, 1 with both diagnoses at 50 years, and 1 first diagnosed at <50 years then again at 50 years.

diagnosis level. However, when calculating overall survival (OS), we only included data from the first diagnosis.
RESULTS
Between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2010, 4235
GCT diagnoses (median age, 32 years; range, birth to 82
years) were documented among 4195 men. Of 40 men
with bilateral testicular GCT pathologically confirmed at
MSKCC, 38 had both tumors diagnosed before age 50
years, one had both diagnosed after 50 years, and one had
the first diagnosis at age 36 years and the second at 51
years. Both diagnoses were included for all patients (Table
1). Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 3.7 years
(< 50: 3.8 years;  50: 2.7 years).
Comparison of Patient Characteristics Based on
Age at Diagnosis < 50 Years Versus  50 Years

There were 3999 (94.4%) GCT diagnoses in men < 50
years (median age, 31 years) compared with 236 (5.6%)
diagnoses in men  50 years (median age, 54 years). Of
4235 diagnoses, 2608 (61.6%) were NSGCT, 1615
(38.1%) were seminoma, and 10 (0.2%) were spermatocytic seminoma. In 2 cases, differentiation between

seminoma and nonseminoma was not possible, resulting
in classification as “GCT, not otherwise specified” (Table
1). Among 40 men with bilateral GCT confirmed at
MSKCC, 12 were synchronous and 28 were metachronous; 16 had bilateral seminoma, 8 had bilateral nonseminoma, and 16 had discordant histologies (seminoma on
one side, nonseminoma on the other).
Median ages for nonseminoma, seminoma, and
spermatocytic seminoma were 29 years (range, birth to 73
years), 35 years (range, 5-77 years), and 46 years (range,
33-82 years), respectively. Compared with younger men,
patients diagnosed at age  50 years were more likely to
have seminoma (62.7% versus 36.7%) and less likely to
have nonseminoma (34.7% versus 63.2%) (P < .0001;
Table 1). Spermatocytic seminoma was proportionately
more frequent among patients diagnosed at age  50 years
(1.7% versus 0.2%) but roughly equal numbers of absolute cases were diagnosed in older (n 5 4) and younger
(n 5 6) men. All patients with spermatocytic seminoma
were alive and disease-free at last follow-up except one
who died at age 95 years.
The distribution of primary tumor sites also differed
significantly by age at diagnosis. Testis was the most frequent primary tumor site for both age groups but was statistically less common in older (89.4%) versus younger
patients (92.9%), mostly attributable to a higher proportion of retroperitoneal (3.8% versus 0.7%) and other/
unknown (2.1% versus 0.4%) primary sites in older men
(Table 1). Primary central nervous system (CNS) GCT
occurred exclusively in patients aged < 50 years with pineal gland comprising the most common CNS location.
Mediastinal primary tumor proportion was similar across
age groups. However, as with testicular tumors, most
(100 of 166, 60%) mediastinal tumors diagnosed at
age < 50 years were NSGCT, whereas 8 (73%) of 11 diagnosed  50 years were seminoma.
Overall, 431 (10.3%) patients have died, including
38 men diagnosed at  50 years (Fig. 1A). The 5-year
actuarial OS rate for men diagnosed at < 50 years was
0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5 0.87-0.90) compared with 0.82 (95% CI 5 0.74-0.88) for men  50
years. Causes of death for men diagnosed at  50 years
included GCT in 23 (61%), secondary non-GCT malignancy in 5 (13%), and causes other than cancer in 10
(26%). Causes of death were not available for review for
all younger patients.
Comparisons Across Smaller Age Ranges

Cases were further divided into smaller age strata (Table
2) and compared for primary site and histology. The pre2576

dominant histology switched from NSGCT to seminoma
around age 35 (ages 30-35 years: 57.8% NSGCT versus
age > 35-40 years: 51.4% seminoma). NSGCT frequency
peaked at 85.0% among 15- to 19-year-olds. For seminoma, peak frequency was 63.4% in 50- to 59-year-olds.
For primary site, mediastinal tumor frequency
remained relatively constant across age groups (range,
3.7%-6.0%). Retroperitoneal primary tumors comprised
7.6% of diagnoses made before age 15 but then declined
to only 0.4%-1.0% of diagnoses between ages 15 to 49,
before rising again to 3.2% and 6.0% for ages 50-59 years
and  60 respectively. For patients with retroperitoneal

AJCC Stage Distribution, Management, and
Outcome for Patients Aged  50

Of 166 patients who presented to MSKCC for initial
management at age  50 years, 113 (68%) had seminoma
and 53 (32%) had NSGCT. Most men with seminoma
had stage I disease (66 men, 58%). The initial management strategy for all patients with seminoma, including
those with more advanced disease, is provided in Table 3.
Notably, one patient with stage IIIB (T2N1M0S2) seminoma was treated with radiation but qualified as IIIB only
because of a moderately elevated lactate dehydrogenase
level. Six patients had primary mediastinal seminoma,
most often managed with primary chemotherapy. Of 53
patients with NSGCT, 18, 18, and 14 were diagnosed
with stage I, II, and III, respectively. Three patients had
primary mediastinal NSGCT. Stage and initial treatment
strategy for all 53 NSGCT patients are listed in Table 4.
Tolerance to Chemotherapy in GCT Patients
Aged  50 Years

Of 50 patients aged  50 years (median, 54 years; range,
50-76 years) who received first-line platinum-based
chemotherapy, 30 had NSGCT and 20 had seminoma.
Initial regimens are summarized in Table 5 and included
etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) in 78%, bleomycin plus EP
(BEP) in 14%, etoposide plus carboplatin (EC) in 6% (as
part of a clinical trial8 or due to renal insufficiency), and
etoposide plus ifosfamide plus cisplatin (VIP) in 2%.
Treatment-related complications were frequent across all
regimens (Table 6). In 30 (60%) patients, complications
led to treatment discontinuation, change in regimen, or
significant delay ( 7 days). For BEP, 5 of 7 (72%)
patients required change to an alternate regimen, 4 for

worsening pulmonary function and 1 for thromboembolic complications (4 were changed to EP and 1 to
BEC). Thirty-eight (97%) of 39 patients receiving EP
completed all planned cycles, as did all patients starting
VIP (n 5 1) and EC (n 5 3). The 1 EP patient who did
not complete the full 4 cycles was switched to EC due to
renal failure. Twenty-two (44%) patients experienced  1 episode of neutropenic fever, 6 of these despite
initiation of prophylactic growth factor support at cycle
one. By regimen, rates of neutropenic fever per cycle
were 14%, 24%, 25%, and 36% for EP, BEP, VIP, and
EC, respectively (Table 6). Of 41 patients with goodrisk disease, 22 achieved a complete response (CR), 18
achieved partial response with negative markers (PR2),
and 1 an incomplete response (IR). Of 6 intermediaterisk patients, 3 achieved a CR, 2 a PR2, and 1 an IR
whereas among 3 poor-risk patients, there was 1 CR and
2 IRs. Ten of 50 patients have died (7 from GCT, 1
from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 2 from nonmalignant causes); with a median follow-up of 5 years
(range, 0.81-19.6 years), estimated 5-year OS is 84.9%
(95% CI 5 69.1%-93.0%) (Fig. 1B). Notably, 3 of 7

DISCUSSION
Of the approximately 9000 cases of GCT diagnosed
annually in the United States, more than 90% occur in
men under age 50 years.4,9,10 According to SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) data from
1975 to 2009, the age-adjusted incidence of testicular cancer was 6.3 per 100,000 for men < 50 years versus only
2.0 per 100,000 for men  50 years.11 Because of the rarity of GCT in older men, data on their clinical characteristics and outcome are lacking. Furthermore, prior
epidemiologic reports on GCT have primarily consisted
of population-based studies, which while instructive, suffer from a lack of detailed clinical information. For example, SEER provides limited information on histologic
subtypes, stage distribution, and treatment administered.
We addressed some of these issues through retrospective analysis of our large single-institution database.
Our findings confirm the rarity of GCT diagnoses in
men  50 years, comprising only 5.6% of > 4200 cases.
The lower rate observed here compared with the 8.8%
incidence estimated from SEER data9 is not explained by
our inclusion of GCT patients with extragonadal primary
sites (among testicular GCT patients, 5.4% were diagnosed in men  50 years) but could reflect a decreased
tendency toward referral of older GCT patients to tertiary
care centers.
As expected, distribution of histologic subtypes differed significantly with age. Seminoma constituted most
(62.7%) diagnoses at age  50 years whereas NSGCT
constituted the dominant (63.2%) histology for
men < 50 years. The ratio of NSGCT to seminoma

Features and Outcome of Older Men With GCT/Feldman et al

gradually decreased with advancing age, with switch to
seminoma predominance at approximately age 35. This
novel finding suggests an age cutoff of 35 to 40 years may
better distinguish between older and younger groups.
Distribution of primary tumor sites also varied by
age at diagnosis. Retroperitoneal primary GCT was > 5
times more frequent among older men. The existence of
retroperitoneal primary GCT is considered controversial,
often attributed to lack of thorough evaluation for an
occult testicular tumor. For all 9 older men diagnosed
with retroperitoneal primary tumors, scrotal ultrasound
(in 8 of the 9) and orchiectomy reports (in 1 of the 9)
were reviewed, confirming the absence of testicular
masses, including “burnt-out” lesions. To our knowledge,
an association between retroperitoneal primary tumors
and age has not been previously identified. In agreement
with SEER data,12 mediastinal tumors constituted the
most common extragonadal primary tumor site among
both age groups in our cohort with comparable incidence.
Also consistent with prior reports,13,14 CNS primary
tumors in our cohort occurred exclusively among
patients < 50 years old (range 5 2-41 years).
Some prior studies have reported older age to correlate with more advanced disease at GCT diagnosis and inferior outcome to treatment. In a SEER-based study,
diagnosis of testicular cancer at  50 years was associated
with inferior survival, even when correcting for stage and
histology.9 Similarly, a histopathologic study of 50 men
with GCT diagnosed at age  60 years found larger primary tumor size and more frequent lymphovascular invasion and rete testis involvement compared with historical
controls of all ages.15 In contrast, a recent retrospective series found 77% of 60 patients diagnosed at  60 years
presented with stage I disease,16 comparable with rates in
younger patients.17,18
Although our study does not allow direct comparison of stage distribution for older versus younger men,
stage and initial treatment are provided for 166 GCT
patients who presented to MSKCC at  50 years. Of 113
seminoma patients, 58%, 27%, and 10% had stage I, II,
and III disease, respectively, compared with 34%, 34%,
and 26% of 53 NSGCT patients. In contrast, stage distribution (I, II, and III) in SEER for adult men with testicular GCT was 85.8%, 7.2%, and 5.5%, respectively for
seminoma and 61.5%, 19.0%, and 17.8% for NSGCT.18
Although this suggests higher stage distribution for older
patients, referral bias (higher stage distribution for all
GCT patients at our center) represents another possible
explanation because stage was not reviewed for younger
patients in our cohort.

Data on systemic chemotherapy in older patients
with advanced GCT is very limited.16,19 We found
advanced age significantly affected tolerability of first-line
platinum-based chemotherapy. Complications were frequent in men  50 years, exceeding historical rates from
phase 3 studies, which were conducted primarily in
younger patients. Thirty (60%) patients had significant
dose delays or could not complete their planned chemotherapy course, most requiring change to an alternate regimen. Similarly, among 15 patients with GCT treated
with EP or BEP at  60 years in the study by Wheater and
colleagues, 30% could not complete their planned treatment, despite prophylactic dose attenuations.16 Although
our study is limited by lack of direct comparison of complication rates among older and younger men receiving
chemotherapy at our institution, many of our younger
patients were included in one of the historical control
studies,8 indicating applicability to our population.
Although elderly patients are thought to derive similar benefit from chemotherapy as younger subjects,20,21 it
is also recognized that older age, through functional disability and comorbidities, can adversely affect outcome.22
Such studies have mostly focused on the geriatric population in other malignancies.23-25 Although the median age
of our chemotherapy cohort was only 54 years, the
increased complication rate observed compared to reports
of younger men is not entirely surprising. Even among
patients without significant comorbidities, age-related
decline in organ function can impact chemotherapy pharmacokinetics, increasing drug exposure and toxicity. Such
changes are not limited to geriatric patients, but occur
steadily throughout adult life.26,27
Age-related changes in organ function also influence
class-specific toxicity. Hematopoietic reserve, a primary
determinant of myelosuppression with cytotoxic therapy,
is thought to decrease with age.28 Febrile neutropenia
occurred in 44% of patients aged  50 years who received
first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, including 6 who
received prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. This rate is significantly higher than that reported
with BEP and EP in randomized trials (5%-23%).8,29-32
Wheater and colleagues found a slightly lower (33%) incidence of febrile neutropenia among patients with GCT
who were treated at  60 years,16 possibly due to their use
of prophylactic dose attenuations. Based on the high incidence of neutropenic fever that we observed, we recommend routine use of prophylactic granulocyte colonystimulating factor for patients  50 years.
Older age also affects the risk of bleomycin pulmonary toxicity. In a series of 800 GCT patients treated with
2579

Original Article

bleomycin-containing regimens, age > 40 years was independently associated with the likelihood of pulmonary
toxicity on multivariate analysis.33 Potential explanations
for this association include age-related changes in pulmonary physiology34 and effects of declining organ function
on bleomycin pharmacokinetics. Bleomycin is primarily
renally excreted,35 and impaired glomerular filtration, as
occurs with older age,26 independently predicts for bleomycin pulmonary toxicity.33
Despite an increased incidence of toxicity, it is important to emphasize that outcome for older men treated
with chemotherapy remained comparable with historical
results in younger men with median 5-year OS of 85%.
Therefore, clinicians should still recommend full-dose curative treatment to these patients but escalate supportive
measures, including prophylactic growth factor support
to offset the potential for greater toxicity.
In summary, this study describes the rare incidence
and distinct clinical features of men diagnosed with GCT
at age  50 years. Chemotherapy complications such as
neutropenic fever occur frequently in these patients,
requiring increased supportive care measures and careful
observation. Nevertheless, overall prognosis remains
excellent when risk-directed chemotherapy is administered with curative intent.
