Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) is abnormally
expressed in many cancers. In this study, we showed that TRAP1 is aberrantly
upregulated in breast tumors compared to control tissues. TRAP1 knockdown
downregulates mitochondrial aerobic respiratory, sensitizes cells to lethal stimuli, and
inhibited tumor growth in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vivo. TRAP1
overexpression, however, enhances the capacity to cope with stress conditions. These
evidences suggested that TRAP1 is required for tumorigenesis. We also found that
TRAP1 regulates the mitochondrial morphology. Relatively lower TRAP1 levels are
associated with the rod-shaped mitochondrial phenotype in invasive and metastatic
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; on the contrary, higher TRAP1 levels are associated
with the tubular network-shaped mitochondrial phenotype in non-invasive MCF-7
cells. Interestingly, the expression of TRAP1 in human breast cancer specimens
inversely correlates with tumor grade. Overexpression of TRAP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells
causes mitochondrial fusion, triggers mitochondria to form tubular networks, and
suppresses cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. These data link TRAP1regulated mitochondrial dynamics and function with tumorigenesis of breast cancer
and suggested that TRAP1 may therefore be a potential target for breast cancer drug
development.

INTRODUCTION

cancer is determined by its classification. While targeted
therapies such as tamoxifen and trastuzumab benefit
patients with ER+ and HER2+ breast cancers [2, 3], the
basal phenotype, characterized by the lack of expression
of ERα, PR and HER2 (referred to as triple-negative
breast cancer), is more difficult to treat and often has a
poor prognosis. ER+ and HER+ phenotypes also suffer
as targeted therapies eventually fail, due to the intrinsic
or acquired resistance derived from tumor heterogeneity
or genomic instability. This instability includes mutations
and alterations in drug transporter proteins, suppression
of apoptotic pathways, and altered signal transduction [4].

Breast cancer is one of the most frequently
diagnosed cancers in women, comprising 23% of new
cancer cases and 14% of all cancer deaths [1]. Breast
cancer is also a complex and heterogeneous disease. Based
on histological type, tumor grade, lymph node status and
the presence of predictive markers (including estrogen
receptor (ER); progesterone receptor (PR); and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)), breast cancer
could be classified into at least five subtypes: luminal A,
luminal B, HER2, basal and normal. Treatment of breast

RESULTS

Therefore, new drug targets are needed to improve therapy
and prolong the survival of patients with breast cancer.
Mitochondria are the energy center and signaling
hubs within cells. They are essential for maintaining
aspects of physiology such as cellular energy balance,
metabolism, modulation of calcium signaling and the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway; it also defines cellular redox
balance and regulates important biosynthetic pathways.
Dysregulation of mitochondria impairs mitochondrial
function, leading to disease or tumor development [5].
Since mitochondrial function is also crucial for certain
types of cancer cells, particularly under low glucose
conditions commonly observed in solid tumors [6, 7],
targeting cancer cell mitochondria might be a novel
strategy for the treatment of cancer [8]. Anticancer agents
that specifically target the cancer cell mitochondria are
denoted as “mitocans”. This group of drugs is represented
by redox-silent vitamin analogs [9, 10] that disrupt
the normal functioning of mitochondrial complex II.
This disruption causes inhibition of ATP generation
that eventually leads to apoptosis in cancer cells. In
addition, inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I (NADH
dehydrogenase), such as metformin [11] and phenformin
[6], also show anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo.
Mitochondrial Hsp90 chaperone tumor necrosis
factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1; also termed
as Hsp75) is abnormally expressed in many cancers; it
is also suggested to be a potential therapeutic target for
cancer [12, 13]. TRAP1was initially identified as an Hsp90
homolog interacting with the TNF receptor [14], which is
localized mainly to the mitochondria and its ATP-binding
site is sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors [15-17]. Recent reports
revealed aberrant up-regulation of TRAP1 in pancreas,
colon, lung, prostate and colorectal cancers [18-21],
whereas significant loss of TRAP1 expression was also
observed in non-Hodgkin lymphomas and pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors [22]. TRAP1 overexpression
creates a resistance to stress stimuli and protects human
cancer cells from apoptosis [13, 21, 23-29]; it is also
associated with chemotherapy response and overall
survival in ovarian and colorectal cancers [20, 30], human
esophageal squamous cell cancer [31] and non–small cell
lung cancer [32]. However, the role of TRAP1 in breast
cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis remains elusive.
In this study, we analyzed the expression of TRAP1
in breast tumor specimens and established breast cancer
cell lines by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. We
also manipulated TRAP1 levels in different types of breast
cancer cells and measured its effect on tumorigenesis and
metastasis in vitro and in vivo. To address the possible
mechanisms, the impact of TRAP1 on mitochondrial
morphology and function was investigated. Based on
the results, we propose that TRAP1 exhibits essential
roles in tumorigenesis of breast cancer via modulation of
mitochondrial homeostasis.

TRAP1 is aberrantly upregulated in breast cancer
and is required for tumorigenesis
We first analyzed TRAP1 expression in human
breast cancer samples. Western blot analysis showed
that TRAP1 was up-regulated in the majority of tested
specimens (9 out of 10) compared to patient-matched
adjacent normal breast tissues (Figure 1A). To investigate
the involvement of TRAP1 in tumorigenesis, breast
cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436,
MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468) were transfected with
non-silencing control (NC) or TRAP1-specific shRNA
(shTRAP1) vectors (Figure 1B). The impact of TRAP1
knockdown on the anchorage-independent growth was
estimated by a soft-agar colony formation assay. We found
that knockdown of TRAP1 inhibited colony formation
in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and MDAMB-453 cells (Figure 1C), and induced cell death in
MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure S1).
To further determine the importance of TRAP1
in tumorigenesis, we investigated the effect of TRAP1
knockdown on tumor growth in vivo. MDA-MB-231 and
MCF-7 cells stably expressing NC or shTRAP1 were
injected subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of
nude mice, respectively. TRAP1 knockdown substantially
inhibited in vivo tumor growth derived from MDAMB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells (Figure 1D and 1E). It
should be noted that inhibition of the tumorigenic capacity
of breast cancer cells by TRAP1 is not due to inhibition
of cell proliferation because there was no difference in
growth of control breast cancer cells expressing NC and
cells expressing shTRAP1 (Figure S2).

TRAP1 mediates the cellular responses to stress
stimuli
The above data suggested that TRAP1, a member
of the mitochondrial Hsp90 family, is required for
tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells. Since Hsp90
family members can protect cancer cells against proapoptotic stimuli, we investigated whether TRAP1 also
modulates cellular responses to stress stimuli. We either
overexpressed or down-regulated TRAP1 in MDAMB-231 cells, and then treated cells with different
lethal stimuli and measured their viability. Results
shown in Figure 2A indicate that knockdown of TRAP1
significantly potentiated Taxol-induced cell death whereas
overexpression of TRAP1 attenuated Taxol-induced cell
death (Figure 2B). Considering that elevated levels of
reactive oxygen species are often observed in tumors,
we further characterized TRAP1-overexpressing cells for
their response to oxidative stress. As shown in Figure 2C

and 2D, overexpression of TRAP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells
significantly increased their resistance to oxidative stress
induced by glucose oxidase and H2O2.

significant difference in TRAP1 status was observed in
tumors with different stage (P = 0.699), age (P = 0.23),
or histochemical markers (Her2, ER, and PR) (Table
1). Since late-grade tumors (Grade 3 and 4) often have
a higher metastatic capacity, we next analyzed TRAP1
levels in breast cancer cell lines with different invasive
and metastatic abilities. Results shown in Figure 3B and
3C indicate that both protein and mRNA levels of TRAP1
are much lower in invasive cell lines (MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-436) than in non- and less
invasive cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453). These
data suggest an inverse correlation between TRAP1
expression levels and metastatic capacity of breast cancer
cells.

TRAP1 expression is inversely correlated
with tumor grade and overexpression inhibits
metastasis
Given the fact that TRAP1 is overexpressed
in breast cancer and is crucial for tumorigenesis, we
examined TRAP1 protein levels in different human breast
cancer specimens by immunohistochemical staining.
Surprisingly, TRAP1 levels inversely correlate with breast
cancer tumor grade (P = 0.042) (Figure 3A; Table 1). No

TRAP1 modulates mitochondrial morphology

To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed TRAP1 in
invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells. As compared
to vector control and ∆1-59 TRAP1 (lacking mitochondrial
signal recognition peptide), overexpression of TRAP1
inhibited the invasive activity of MDA-MB-231 cells
in vitro (Figure 3D and 3E). We further investigated the
impact of TRAP1 overexpression on metastasis in vivo.
TRAP1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3F)
were injected into the tail vein of immunodeficient nude
mice. Six weeks later, we sacrificed the mice, removed
the lungs, and counted metastatic nodules. As shown in
Figure 3G, nodules of TRAP1-overexpressing cells were
less than that of control MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting
that TRAP1 overexpression inhibits cancer cell metastasis
in vivo.

The migration of cancer cells is a highly orchestrated
multistep process that needs abundant ATP. Drp1 and Mfn
proteins control mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and
fission) and modulate mitochondrial function, which plays
a critical role in breast cancer cell migration and invasion
[33]. Since TRAP1 overexpression inhibits metastasis of
breast cancer cells, we then examined whether TRAP1
impacts cell motility by regulating mitochondrial
dynamics. Invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells
express relatively low levels of endogenous TRAP1 (see
Figure 3) and have a rod-shaped mitochondrial phenotype.
Further knockdown of TRAP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells had
little impact on mitochondrial morphology (Figure 4B). In
contrast, overexpression of recombinant TRAP1 in MDAMB-231 cells induced the formation of mitochondria
tubular networks (Figure 4A), suggesting an induction of
mitochondrial fusion.

We also investigated the influence of TRAP1 on
mitochondrial morphology in non-invasive MCF-7 cells.
Unlike invasive MDA-MB-231 cells with rod-shaped
mitochondria, mitochondria in MCF-7 cells show a tubular
network-shaped morphology. MCF-7 cells express very
high level of endogenous TRAP1 (see Figure 3). Further
overexpression of recombinant TRAP1 in MCF-7 cells
had no apparent effect on mitochondrial morphology
(Figure 4C). In contrast, knockdown of TRAP1 in MCF-7
cells induced the formation of rod-shaped mitochondria,

suggesting an induction of mitochondrial fission (Figure
4D).
We next examined the expression of fusion- and
fission-related proteins (Drp1, Mfn1, and Mfn2) in
breast cancer cells. Overexpression of TRAP1 decreased
the phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616 site, suggesting a
reduction of active Drp1. In addition, an increase in Mfn1
expression was observed in TRAP1-overexpressed MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 4E). These changes are consistent
with the transformation of mitochondrial morphology to

the tubular phenotype. Similarly, knockdown of TRAP1
in MCF-7 cells led to down-regulation of Mfn1 (Figure
4F), which could be responsible for the transformation of
mitochondrial morphology to the rod-shaped phenotype.

Several groups have suggested TRAP1 as a
predictive marker for prognosis in colorectal cancer [20],
ovarian cancer [30], esophageal squamous cell cancer
[31], non-small cell lung cancer [32], and ulcerative
colitis-associated colorectal cancer [35]. We reported here
that breast cancer samples express high levels of TRAP1
compared with adjacent normal breast tissues, while
knockdown of TRAP1 attenuated the tumorigenicity of
both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells in nude mice,
suggesting the requirement of TRAP1 in breast cancer
tumorigenesis and progression, which was consistent with
previous findings [25].
TRAP1 is generally crucial for colony formation
and tumor growth of the breast cancer cells we tested;
however, the cellular responses after TRAP1 knockdown
were different. Knockdown of TRAP1 in MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-453 cells inhibited colony
formation; however, TRAP1-knockdown MCF-7 cells
still formed colonies, although the sizes were much
smaller (Figure S3). We also found that transfection of
MCF-7 cells with one single shRNA construct, which
downregulated TRAP1 levels moderately, showed
no apparent effect on tumor growth in vivo (Figure
S4A); however, transfection of MCF-7 cells with two
independent shRNA constructs, which downregulated
TRAP1 levels significantly, inhibited tumor growth
in vivo. We speculate that mitochondrial Hsp90 might
compensate for the partial loss of TRAP1. Indeed, Hsp90
was highly expressed in the xenograft tumor samples
and in mitochondrial fractions of breast cancer cells
(Figure S4B, S4C and S4D). The compensatory increased
recruitment of Hsp90 to mitochondria was also observed
in TRAP1-knockout mice as well as in TRAP-1-silencing
prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells [53]. Human Hsp90
proteins are molecular chaperones that include Hsp90α,
Hsp90β, Grp94, and TRAP1 [54]. They form a chaperone
network in mitochondria and other organelles and have
been linked to an adaptation to unfavorable environments.
Considering that Hsp90 that has been recruited to the
mitochondria might compensate for TRAP1, drugs that
target to the mitochondria and inhibit the Hsp90 family
members will be more efficient in the prevention of
TRAP1-related tumorigenesis.
Some of the mechanisms underlying TRAP1dependent tumorigenesis have been suggested.
TRAP1 interacts with cyclophilin D and regulates the
mitochondrial permeability transition [18]; TRAP1
interacts with PINK1 and protects cells against oxidative
stress-induced cell death [36]; TRAP1 interacts with
the Ca2+-binding protein Sorcin and maintains its
mitochondrial localization and stability [28]. TRAP1overexpressing cells are more resistant to 5-fluorouracil
and cisplatin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis [23,
29, 37, 38]. Our data presented here also indicate that
knockdown of TRAP1 sensitized cells to different lethal
stimuli. Thus, TRAP1, as well as other Hsp90 family

oxidative

The data shown above indicate that TRAP1
controls mitochondrial morphology. To further investigate
the impact of TRAP1 on mitochondrial function, we
monitored mitochondrial aerobic respiration in MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 cells using the XF24 extracellular
flux analyzer under normal cell culture conditions (XFDMEM with 25 mM glucose and 2 mM pyruvate).
As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, knockdown of TRAP1
in MDA-MB-231 cells caused a rapid decrease in the
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) levels. Knockdown
of TRAP1 also significantly altered cellular responses to
typical mitochondrial complexes inhibitors (including
OM, an ATP synthase inhibitor; FCCP, a mitochondrial
uncoupler; AA, a complex III inhibitor; rot, a complex
I inhibitor), suggesting that the basal, coupled, leaked,
and maximal mitochondrial OXPHOS capacities were
inhibited. Similar inhibitory effects were observed in
TRAP1-knockdown MCF-7 cells (Figure 5C and 5D).
Cancer cells divide and grow uncontrollably,
and therefore face a considerable metabolic challenge.
Low amino acid and glucose conditions are commonly
observed in solid tumors. We next examined whether
TRAP1 modulates mitochondrial aerobic respiration of
breast cancer cells under stress conditions. When MCF-7
cells were cultured in EBSS supplemented with 1% FBS,
an amino acid-free and growth factor-insufficient solution
mimicking a nutrient-deprived condition [34], knockdown
of TRAP1 decreased the basal, coupled, leaked, and
maximal mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity more
significantly (Figure 5E and 5F). Under another glucosedepleting condition (glucose was replaced with pyruvate),
knockdown of TRAP1 also decreased the mitochondrial
OXPHOS (Figure 5G and 5H). These data clearly indicate
that TRAP1 is crucial for the mitochondrial aerobic
respiration under normal or stressed conditions.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that TRAP1 is
overexpressed in breast cancer. We also provided direct
evidence that TRAP1 links mitochondrial morphology
and function with tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells.
TRAP1 knockdown downregulates mitochondrial aerobic
respiratory, sensitizes cells to lethal stimuli, and inhibits
tumorigenesis; TRAP1 overexpression, however, enhances
the capacity to cope with stress conditions, and is required
for the tumorigenesis of breast cancer.

were transformed into tubular networks, the subcellular
distribution of mitochondria to the lamellipodia was
blocked, and, as a result, the ability of cells to invade
and metastasize were inhibited. On the contrary, nonmetastatic MCF-7 breast cancer cells express high level
of TRAP1, and their mitochondria were tubular networkshaped. Based on these evidences, we hypothesized that
the inversely correlation between metastatic abilities and
TRAP1 levels might be due to the impact of TRAP1 on
mitochondrial dynamics.
In conclusion, the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1
is overexpressed in breast cancer and is required for
tumorigenesis and progression, and contributes to the
adaptation to unfavorable stress conditions by regulating
mitochondrial homeostasis. The results of our study and
future work may offer a feasible therapeutic target for
cancer therapy.

members, is involved in stress protection and apoptosis in
mitochondrial and extramitochondrial compartments.
An impact on mitochondrial metabolism is
also suggested to be involved in TRAP1-dependent
tumorigenesis. Mitochondrial metabolic pathways
produce energy, precursors for macromolecular synthesis,
and substrates for other essential cellular functions [39].
Cancer cells face a considerable metabolic challenge as
they divide and grow uncontrollably, thus resulting in a
drastic adjustment of many metabolic pathways. Cancer
cells often exhibit an increased rate of glycolysis, known as
the Warburg effect [40], which is regarded as an important
hallmark of cancer [41]. TRAP1 regulates a metabolic
switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic
glycolysis [42], probably by binding to the succinate
dehydrogenase of the complex II of the respiratory
chain [13]. The respiratory downregulation elicited by
TRAP1 primes the succinate-dependent stabilization of
the transcription factor HIF1α, and promotes neoplastic
growth and tumorigenesis [43]. However, the function of
TRAP1 in mitochondrial metabolism is more complex,
as a large body of literature shows that pharmacologic
or genetic targeting of TRAP1 inhibited mitochondrial
respiration [44, 45], impaired mitochondrial quality
control [46], and suppressed ATP production [32]. By
monitoring mitochondrial aerobic respiratory in real time,
we provide direct evidences here that TRAP1 is required
for the oxidative phosphorylation of breast cancer cells,
under both normal and nutrient-deficient conditions. Thus,
we suggest that TRAP1 is of crucial importance for cancer
cells, particularly under low glucose conditions commonly
observed in solid tumors.
We also hypothesized that TRAP1 negatively
regulate metastasis by modulating mitochondrial
dynamics. TRAP1 expression inversely correlates
with tumor grade in breast cancers; moreover, levels
of TRAP1 were lower in invasive breast cancer cell
lines than in non-invasive cell lines. These data were
consistent with previous reports that down-regulation of
TRAP1 dramatically enhances invasion in mouse and
human cell lines [42, 47, 48]. Metastasis of cancer cells
requires an abundance of ATP [49-51]. Our recent report
links mitochondrial morphology with the migration and
invasion of breast cancer cells [33]. When mitochondrial
morphology was manipulated, the subcellular distribution
of mitochondria was altered, and breast cancer cell
migration and invasion was decreased. Metastatic MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells express relatively low level
of TRAP1, and their mitochondria were more fragmented
(rod-shaped). Upon chemoattractant exposure, the rodshaped mitochondria were recruited to lamellipodial
regions, where they generate ATP and contributed to
the assembly of F-actin filaments. However, when
we overexpressed TRAP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells,
phosphorylated Drp1 at Ser616 site [52] was downregulated and Mfn1 was up-regulated, the mitochondria

unless otherwise indicated.

Cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.

Patient samples
All tumor samples were obtained with written
informed consent from patients at the Cancer Hospital,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
Ten pair of tumor and adjacent normal breast tissues
were collected immediately after surgical resection and
stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. For western blot
assay, tissue specimens were ground in liquid nitrogencooled mortar, tissue powder was suspended in lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1%
triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM

Soft agar colony formation assay

PMSF, complete protease inhibitor cocktail) and cleared
by centrifugation.
A total of 42 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
breast cancer tissue specimens (5 μm) were included in
Table 1. Immunohistochemical assay was performed using
an anti-TRAP1 antibody. TRAP1 immunopositivity was
graded in one to three tumor scores for each patient based
on the intensity of the immunoreactivity in the cancer
cells, that is, 3 (+++) was strong, 2 (++) moderate, 1 weak
(+), and 0 negative. The scoring of immunoreactivity was
performed as described [55].

After transfection of vectors for 48 h, a soft agar
colony assay was performed. To this end, trypsinized
cells were suspended in DMEM medium containing 10%
FBS and low-melting-point 0.3% agarose (Amresco) and
subsequently overlaid onto a solidified layer of DMEM
medium containing 10% FBS and 0.6% agarose in 35 mm
plate (10,000 cells/plate) in triplicate. After 1 week, the
colonies were fixed in 90% ethanol and imaged with light
microscope. The average areas of colonies are calculated
by ImageJ software.

Construction of vectors and transfection

Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation assays

The full-sequence TRAP1 and a derivative
lacking the mitochondrial signal sequence (1–177) were
amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ and pEGFP-N1,
then transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). For knockdown of TRAP1 expression,
scramble shControl and shTRAP1 were constructed with
core sequence 5’-AAACATGAGTTCCAGGCCGAG-3’
(shTRAP1 1#) and 5’-TTCTGTGTCCTCGGAGGAC-3’
(shTRAP1 2#) [56]. Cells were transfected with the
lentivirus system (Genepharm). Transfection efficiency
was assessed by western blotting and cell sorting, which
was also used to select stably transfected cells.

The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
function of cells was measured by determining the
oxygen consumption rate (OCR) with a Seahorse XF24
extracellular flux analyzer. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
cells were seeded at 40000/well overnight before running
the Seahorse experiment. For measuring OCR, experiment
was performed in medium consist of DMEM or EBSS,
pH 7.4, at 37°C. Oligomycin A (OM; an ATP synthase
inhibitor; final concentration, 1 μM), carbonylcyanide
m-chlorophenylhydrazone (FCCP; a mitochondrial
uncoupler; final concentration, 500 nM), antimycin A
(AA; complex III inhibitor; final concentration, 1 μM)
and rotenone (rot; complex I inhibitor; final concentration,
1 μM) were added into different ports of the Seahorse
cartridge. OCR was measured with a standard cycling
program of 8-min mix (3 min), wait (2 min), and measure
(3 min).

Western blot assay
Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% triton X-100, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1
mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, complete protease inhibitor
cocktail) and cleared by centrifugation to obtain wholecell lysates. Equal amounts of samples were separated
by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes, and immunoblotted with proper
antibodies.

Murine models
Mice were bred and maintained in a specific
pathogen-free environment, and all experiments were
performed according to the guidelines for experimental
animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese
Academy of Sciences (IACUC-IBP).
For xenograft assays, MCF-7 cells (1 × 106 cells/
mice) or MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 106 cells/mice) stably
transfected with shTRAP1 or NC vectors were injected
subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of 6–8-week
old female Balb/c nude mice (Vital River; n = 9–10 for
each group) in 100 μL PBS. Tumors were measured with
a caliper and the volume calculated as follows: volume
(mm3) = (width2 × length)/2. After 22 days (MCF-7) or
38 days (MDA-MB-231), the mice were euthanized
by cervical dislocation and tumor tissues were excised,
imaged, and lysed for western blot analysis.
For experimental metastasis assays, MDA-MB-231
cells were injected into the tail vein of 6–8-week old

RNA preparation and real time-PCR
Total RNA was isolated by using TRIZOL reagent
(Invitrogen) and the phenol-chloroform extraction
method according to manufacturer protocols. The
cDNA was synthesized using a First-Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time
PCR was performed on an ABI 7300 instrument with
UltraSYBR Mixture (CoWin Biosciences) according to
manufacturer instructions with the following primers:
GAPDH, forward: 5’-AGGCTGAGAACGGGAAGC-3’,
reverse: 5’-CCATGGTGGTGAAGACGC-3’; TRAP1,
forward: 5’-CGCAGCATCTTCTACGTGC-3’; reverse:
5’-CTGATGAGTGCGCTCTCC-3’.

Transwell invasion assay
Matrigel invasion assays were performed at 37°C
using 24-well Transwell inserts (Corning) coated with 30
μg Matrigel (BD Biosciences). TRAP1-overexpressing or
control cells (50,000/well) suspended in 200 μL serumfree medium were seeded in the upper chamber, and 600
μL migration inducer was placed in the lower chamber.
Invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells was induced with NIH3T3 conditioned medium. Cells that invaded through the
membrane were quantified, and the data were normalized
to the controls.
