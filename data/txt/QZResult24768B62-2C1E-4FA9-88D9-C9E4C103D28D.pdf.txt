ABSTRACT:

Caspase-2 is ubiquitously expressed and the most evolutionarily conserved
mammalian caspase. It can be activated by a range of death stimuli prior to Bax
activation and the occurrence of apoptotic mitochondrial dysfunctions. Caspase-2
has also been reported to exert tumour suppressor function in vivo. The full length
TAp73alpha isoform is found up-regulated in various tumour types, and is reported
in a cell-type specific manner to repress drug-induced apoptosis. Here, we report
that TAp73alpha represses caspase-2 enzymatic activity and by this means reduce
caspase-2 induced Bax activation, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential
and resulting apoptosis. The inhibitory effect on caspase-2 requires the presence of
the DNA binding domain and SAM domain region of TAp73alpha. In conclusion, the
ability of TAp73alpha to act as an inhibitor of caspase-2-induced cell death together
with its up-regulation in certain tumour types strengthen the potential oncogenic
activities for this protein.

INTRODUCTION

TAp73beta is a shorter isoform, and lacks the extreme
COOH-terminal region and SAM domain [8]. p73 and its
family member p53 share both structural and functional
properties [9-11]. Nevertheless, some key differences
between the two proteins do exist, for example, the
novel structural protein NSP 5a3a can induce apoptosis
via p73, independent of p53 [12]. Moreover, P73 gene
mutations are seldom noticed in tumours as compared
with P53 gene mutations [13]. However, mice selectively
devoid of the TAp73 isoforms (TAp73 null mice) do show
increased incidence of spontaneous tumors [14]. On the
other hand, increased TAp73alpha expression levels
has been noticed in certain cancers like, cervical cancer
[7], medulloblastoma [15], B-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia [16], ovarian carcinomas [17], gastric
adenocarcinoma [18], bladder cancer [19] and thyroid
cancer [20]. In some tumour cell lines, increased levels of
TAp73alpha were detected after various drug treatments,
e.g. etoposide (VP16; Vepesid®), and camptothecin
[21]. We previously reported that TAp73alpha inhibits
drug (i.e. VP16, cisplatin and staurosporine)-induced
apoptosis in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells. The
anti-apoptotic effect is exerted upstream of mitochondrial

The transcription factor p73 is a multi-functional
protein that belongs to the p53 family of proteins. Indeed,
p73 is able to regulate cell cycle arrest [1], apoptosis [2],
differentiation [3] and development [4]. The p73 protein
contains a NH2-terminal transactivation (TA) domain, a
highly conserved core DNA-binding domain (DBD), and
a COOH-terminal oligomerization domain [5-6]. The P73
gene has two alternative promoters (p1 and p2) and gives
rise to a vast number of isoforms due to the use of these
promoters and from alternative splicing at the COOHterminal region. The two alternative promoters located at
the NH2-terminal region generate either transactivation
(TA) competent or TA deficient (deltaN) primary
transcripts of p73. Alternative splicing of each of these
primary p73 transcripts can theoretically generate nine
different COOH-terminal isoform variants (alpha, beta,
gamma, delta, epsilon, theta, zeta, eta and eta1) [7]. Among
these isoforms, TAp73alpha and TAp73beta are the two
main expressed isoforms in human cells. TAp73alpha
is the longest isoform, comprise an extended COOHterminus including a sterile alpha motif (SAM) region.

outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), at the level
of Bax activation [22].
Interestingly, caspase-2, one of the ubiquitously
expressed and the most evolutionarily conserved
mammalian caspase, can be activated before the MOMP that
occurs during apoptosis induced by a range of death stimuli
[23-33]. In fact, caspase-2 has long been recognized as an
important protein in the regulation of apoptosis [30, 34].
Caspase-2 contains a caspase activation and recruitment
domain (CARD), and biochemical studies indicate that
the primary event required for caspase-2 activation is
CARD-dependent dimerization. Recruitment of caspase-2
to activation complexes, such as the PIDDosome, induce
caspase-2 proximity and hence, its activation [35-36].
Worth to notice is that caspase-2 over-expression per se
leads to CARD-mediated dimerization, enzyme activation
and induction of apoptotic cell death [35, 37]. Active
caspase-2 was found to engage mitochondria by directly

Bax translocation to the mitochondria [27, 30, 38].
Caspases-3, -7 and -9 have been shown to be
susceptible to inhibition by members of the inhibitors
of apoptosis (IAP) family [39]. Despite the fact that
caspase-2 was the second caspase to be cloned in 1992,
to date no natural caspase-2 inhibitors have been reported
(with the exception of some baculoviral proteins, e.g.
p35 and p49) [37]. Since TAp73alpha has been reported
to exert its anti-apoptotic effects in SCLC cells upstream
of Bax activation, this inspired us to investigate whether
TAp73alpha could modulate cell death mediated by
caspase-2. In the present study we reveal that TAp73alpha
is able to repress caspase-2 induced apoptosis in SCLC
NCI-H82 cells, through inhibition of caspase-2 enzymatic
activity. Upon TAp73alpha expression, caspase-2 induced
Bax activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
and consequent cell death were found reduced. Moreover,
we report that both the DBD and the SAM domain of

to a significant decrease in the percentage of apoptotic
cells as compared to cells transfected with caspase-2 alone
(Fig. 1A, 1C and D). On the other hand, co-expression
with TAp73beta significantly promoted caspase-2 induced
apoptosis (Fig. 1B). Increasing the ratio of TAp73alpha
to caspase-2 expression decreased caspase-2 induced
apoptosis in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Hence,
caspase-2 over-expression per se can induce apoptosis
in SCLC NCI-H82 cells, an event that can be prevented
by the simultaneous co-expression of anti-apoptotic
TAp73alpha.

RESULTS
TAp73alpha inhibits apoptosis induced by
caspase-2 over-expression in SCLC NCI-H82 cells
Caspase-2 processing and activation occurs rapidly
in response to both intrinsic and extrinsic cell death
signalling [40-42]. In turn, active caspase-2 promotes
Bax translocation to the mitochondria [27]. Moreover, the
ability of over-expressed caspase-2 to promote apoptosis
is established [34, 43]. We have previously shown that
full-length TAp73alpha represses drug-induced apoptosis
in SCLC cells, upstream of the mitochondria at the level
of Bax activation [22, 44]. To test whether caspase-2 overexpression induces apoptosis in SCLC NCI-H82 cells
and whether TAp73alpha can exert a repressive effect
on caspase-2 induced cell death, apoptosis assays were
performed. NCI-H82 SCLC cells were co-transfected
with EGFP together with either an empty (control) vector
or plasmids encoding TAp73alpha, TAp73beta and/or
caspase-2. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells
were fixed with 4% PFA, stained with Hoechst and scored
under a fluorescence microscope as percentage of EGFP
expressing cells displaying apoptotic nuclei. In NCI-H82
cells, caspase-2 expression induced a robust apoptotic
cell death (Fig. 1A, 1B and 1D), whereas TAp73alpha
expression only caused small increase in apoptosis as
compared to the basal level (Fig. 1A and D). Remarkably,
co-expression of TAp73alpha together with caspase-2 led

TAp73alpha expression inhibits caspase-2 activity
Thereafter, we investigated whether the protective
effect of TAp73alpha on caspase-2 induced apoptosis
could be mediated by direct physical protein-protein
interaction. Hence, co-immunoprecipitation experiments
were performed, but no physical interaction between
these two proteins could be detected. Despite the apparent
lack of protein-protein interaction, we speculated that
TAp73alpha might affect the actual enzymatic activity
of caspase-2. NCI-H82 cells were transfected with
TAp73alpha, caspase-2 and/or empty expression vectors,
and caspase-2 activity was monitored. The enzyme activity
of caspase-2 (VDVADase activity) was evaluated as the
release of AMC from the substrate Ac-VDVAD-AMC
(Ac-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin)
[28]. As previously reported in other cell types, caspase-2
over-expression lead to increased VDVADase activity
in NCI-H82 cells (Fig. 2). TAp73alpha over-expression
caused a small increase in caspase-2 activity, compared
to the mock vector transfected cells. Interestingly, coexpression of TAp73alpha with caspase-2 significantly
prevented caspase-2 induced VDVADase activity in
NCI-H82 cells (Fig. 2). Altogether these data indicate
that TAp73alpha is able to inhibit the enzyme activity of
caspase-2 in SCLC NCI-H82 cells.

Fully processed and active caspase-2 can permeabilize
the outer mitochondrial membrane and cause cytochrome c
release [33, 45], which activates the apoptotic cascade
[28]. We have shown that TAp73alpha is able to prevent
VP16-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
in SCLC cells [22, 44]. To explore whether the protective
effect of TAp73alpha over-expression on caspase-2
induced apoptosis involve repression of mitochondrial
dysfunction, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential
was investigated.

encoding TAp73alpha, and/or caspase-2. Twenty-four
hours post-transfection, cells were stained with TMRE and
then assessed for the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane
potential (TMRE-negative cells) by scoring EGFP
expressing cells by FACS analysis. In NCI-H82 cells,
caspase-2 over-expression provoked a noteworthy
loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (37.8%
cells with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential),
whereas TAp73alpha expression showed limited effect
as compared to control (15% vs. 12.3% cells with loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential) (Fig. 3). Interestingly,
caspase-2 induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane
potential was reduced when cells were co-transfected
with TAp73alpha (from 37.8% to 23.7% cells with loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential) (Fig. 3). Altogether
these data indicate that TAp73alpha inhibits the caspase-2
induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in
SCLC NCI-H82 cells.

over-expression on caspase-2 induced apoptosis is due
to repression of Bax activation. To investigate how
caspase-2 and TAp73alpha regulate Bax activation, we
took advantage of the 6A7 anti-Bax antibody, which
recognizes the membrane-bound active form of Bax
[47]. NCI-H82 cells were co-transfected with EGFP and
plasmids encoding TAp73alpha, caspase-2 and/or empty
expression vectors. Twenty-four hours post-transfection,
NCI-H82 cells were collected and probed with the 6A7
anti-Bax antibody and subsequently incubated with Alexa
Fluor 635-conjugated secondary antibody. The samples
were analyzed for increased fluorescence by FACS
to assess Bax activation. As shown in figure 4, overexpression of caspase-2 in NCI-H82 cells leads to Bax
conformational changes (Fig. 4, middle, right histogram).
Co-expression of TAp73alpha resulted in a decrease of
caspase-2-induced Bax activation (Fig. 4, bottom, right
histogram). Taken together, in SCLC NCI-H82 cells,
TAp73alpha seems to counteract the effect of caspase-2 on
Bax, and consequently inhibit the mitochondrial cell death
pathway activated upon Bax conformational changes.

TAp73alpha DBD and SAM domain are required
for inhibition of caspase-2 induced apoptosis

It has previously been shown that caspase-2 is
essential for the integration of cytosolic Bax into the outer
mitochondrial membrane, an event that is important for
subsequent activation of Bax [46]. We have previously
shown that TAp73alpha is able to prevent Bax activation
upon VP16 treatment [22, 44]. Thus, we decided to
explore whether the protective effect of TAp73alpha

We previously characterized which domains of
TAp73alpha are essential for the repression of VP16induced apoptosis in SCLC NCI-H82 cells. The DBD and
the unique carboxyl terminus SAM domain of p73alpha
were both found to be required for its anti-apoptotic
function [22]. To detect the domains that were required
for TAp73alpha inhibitory effect on caspase-2 induced
apoptosis, NCI-H82 cells were co-transfected with
EGFP together with either an empty (control) vector or
plasmids encoding different mutant forms of TAp73alpha
and/or caspase-2 and apoptosis assay was performed.
In the context of caspase-2 induced cell death, the
TAp73alphaDBD mutant construct with a double point
mutation in the DNA binding domain [48] was not able to
modulate apoptosis induced by caspase-2 over-expression
(Fig. 5). The deletion construct of TAp73alpha lacking
the SAM domain was also unable to inhibit caspase-2
induced apoptosis (Fig. 5). In fact, over-expression of
the TAp73alphaSAMdel mutant potentiated caspase-2
induced apoptosis in NCI-H82 SCLC cells, in a manner
similar to that of TAp73beta. These data suggest that
both the DBD and the SAM domain of TAp73alpha are
involved in the inhibition of caspase-2 induced cell death.

Although both TAp73alpha and TAp73beta
can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis upon drug
treatment, TAp73alpha expression is increased in a range
of tumours and has been shown to confer resistance of

some tumour cells towards drug-treatment [22, 44, 49].
Previously, we have shown that TAp73alpha can repress
drug-induced apoptosis in a cell-type specific manner.
We demonstrated this effect to be exerted upstream of
the mitochondria, at the level of Bax activation [22, 44].
Here, we provide an additional mechanism in support
of the anti-apoptotic effect of TAp73alpha. Caspase-2
activation occurs rapidly in response to a wide range of
death stimuli and is associated with Bax activation and
mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that it may have a
general role in apoptosis [40-42]. In this study we show
that the TAp73alpha, but not the TAp73beta isoform, is
able to repress caspase-2 induced cell death in SCLC
NCI-H82 cells. In these cells, we found that TAp73alpha
inhibit caspase-2 enzymatic activity and thereby prevent
caspase-2 induced Bax activation and subsequent loss of
mitochondrial transmembrane potential.
Some of the functional differences between TAp73
isoforms, e.g. TAp73alpha and TAp73beta, are likely to
be explained by the specific interactions of TAp73alpha

unique domains, i.e. SAM domain and extreme carboxyterminus, with other proteins. Specific p63-regulated
micro-RNAs have been shown to regulate TAp73 levels
in general [50], but the receptor for activated kinase
1 (RACK1) only interacts with TAp73alpha carboxyterminus, ultimately resulting in reduced transcriptional
activity and inhibition of TAp73alpha-induced apoptosis
[51]. Due to its extended carboxy-terminus, TAp73alpha,
but not TAp73beta, can be covalently modified by
SUMO-1. Sumoylation at the COOH-terminal lysine 627
leads to a more rapid degradation of TAp73alpha by the
proteasome [52]. Here, we characterized the structure
requirement for the repressive effect of TAp73alpha on
caspase-2 induced cell death in SCLC NCI-H82 cells
and found that the DNA binding domain as well as the
unique SAM domain of TAp73alpha are required for the
suppression of caspase-2 induced cell death.
Recent investigations suggests that caspase-2 may
have additional roles in DNA damage response and cell
cycle regulation [23]. Indeed, several recent publications

provide evidences that caspase-2 can function as a
regulator of cell cycle checkpoints, and in DNA repair
[53-54].
Furthermore, in an E mu-Myc mouse model of
lymphomagenesis, loss of caspase-2 results in an increased
ability of cells to acquire a transformed phenotype and
become malignant, indicating that caspase-2 functions as
a tumour suppressor [55]. Whether TAp73alpha can also
alter these additional caspase-2 functions remain to be
established. Nevertheless, considering that TAp73alpha
overexpression is associated with resistance to treatment
with DNA-damaging agents in human ovarian cancer
and SCLC cell lines [22, 49], this possibility cannot be
excluded.
As mentioned earlier, caspases-3, -7 and -9 are
susceptible to inhibition by members of the inhibitors
of apoptosis (IAP) family, and with the exception of
some baculoviral proteins (e.g. p35 and p49), no natural
caspase-2 inhibitors have been reported. Here we report
that TAp73alpha, a member of p53 family of proteins,
inhibits caspase-2 enzymatic activity and protects SCLC
NCI-H82 cells from caspase-2 mediated mitochondrial
cell death. Moreover, we conclude that the anti-apoptotic
effect of TAp73alpha requires the presence of a functional
DNA binding domain and SAM domain, and operates
at the initiation phase of apoptosis, upstream of Bax
activation and loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane
potential. Caspase-2 activation occurs rapidly in response
to a range of death stimuli and is associated with both
Bax activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting
that it may have a general role in apoptosis [40-42]. Thus,

exhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic characters [57],
was suggested to have a Jekyll and Hyde behaviour in a
cell context dependent manner [58]. This behaviour also
seems to apply to TAp73alpha, a behaviour we obviously
need to understand to make the most use of drugs and
cancer treatments in general.

Cells were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640
medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/
ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Twenty-four hours
after setting in culture dishes with fresh medium, cells
were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. If not stated
otherwise, the co-transfection ratio of TAp73alpha to
caspase-2 was always kept at 2:1. When indicated, H82
cells were treated with 10 uM etoposide (VP16; BristolMyers) for 24 hours. The cell density was kept at levels
allowing exponential growth.

H82 cells were co-transfected with EGFP and
plasmids encoding TAp73 isoforms/mutants, caspase-2
and/or empty (control) vector. One day after transfections,
cells were fixed with 4% PFA, and nuclei were
counterstained using Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes/
Invitrogen). Number of apoptotic cells was scored under
a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging
microscope system) by assessing the percentage of EGFPpositive cells displaying apoptotic nuclear morphology
(fragmented or condensed nuclei).

Measurement of caspase-2 activity

Flow cytometric analysis of Bax activation

H82 cells were transfected with TAp73alpha,
caspase-2 and/or empty expression vectors. After 24
hours of transfection, cells were collected, washed in PBS
and pellets frozen in eppendorf tubes on liquid nitrogen.
After thawing on ice, pellets were re-suspended in 50 ul
PBS, and 25 ul of cell lysate transferred to a microtiter
plate together with 50 uL of caspase-2 assay buffer (0.1M
MES pH 6.5, 0.0001% NP40, 10% PEG, 0.1% CHAPS,
5 mM DTT, 50 uM Ac-VDVAD-AMC). Cleavage of
the fluorogenic peptide substrate, Ac-VDVAD-AMC
(Ac-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin)
was monitored by liberation of AMC in a Fluoroscan
II plate reader (Thermo Electron Co., Waltham, MA,
USA) by using 355 nM excitation and 460 nM emission
wavelengths. Data from triplicate samples were used in
each experiment.

Bax-associated conformational changes were
assessed as previously described [44]. Briefly, one day
after co-transfection of EGFP and plasmids encoding
TAp73alpha, caspase-2 and/or empty (control) vector,
H82 cells were harvested, fixed in 4% PFA and blocked/
permeabilized in PBS with 10 mM HEPES, 0.3% Triton
X-100 and 3% BSA. Subsequently, cells were incubated
with an antibody recognizing N-terminal epitopes of Bax
(clone 6A7; BD Biosciences) at 4°C, overnight, followed
by secondary Alexa Fluor 635-conjugated antibody
(Invitrogen) at room temperature, for 30 minutes. Cells
were re-suspended in PBS. For each sample 10,000 cells
were sorted for green (EGFP) fluorescence using BD
LSR II flow cytometer, and assessed for intensity of Bax
staining using FlowJo software version 9.4.3 (Tree Star,
Ashland, OR).

Statistical analyses were performed using twotailed, paired students t-test, where ***p-value <0.001,
**p-value <0.01 and *p-value <0.05.

Cytofluorometric analysis of mitochondrial
membrane depolarization was assessed by uptake of
tetramethylrhodamine ethyl esters (TMRE; Molecular
Probes/Invitrogen), a lipophilic, cationic fluorochrome
dye that is only taken up by mitochondria having an intact
electrochemical gradient. H82 cells were co-transfected
with EGFP and plasmids encoding TAp73alpha, caspase-2
and/or empty (control) vector. Following TMRE exposure
(added 30 min before harvesting to a final concentration
of 25 nM), cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in
TMRE- containing PBS. Analysis was carried out on
10,000 gated EGFP-expressing cells using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer equipped with CellQuest software (BD
Biosciences).
