Abstract

Author Manuscript

Inappropriate expression or activation of transcription factors can drive patterns of gene
expression leading to the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells. We have found that the
transcriptional repressor BCL6 is highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines, and its locus is
amplified in about half of primary breast cancers. To understand how BCL6 regulates gene
expression in breast cancer cells, we utilized ChIP-seq to identify the BCL6 binding sites on a
genomic scale. This revealed that BCL6 regulates a unique cohort of genes in breast cancer cell
lines compared to B cell lymphomas. Furthermore, BCL6 expression promotes the survival of
breast cancer cells, and targeting BCL6 with a peptidomimetic inhibitor leads to apoptosis of these
cells. Finally, combining a BCL6 inhibitor and a STAT3 inhibitor provided enhanced cell killing
in triple negative breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that combination therapy may be particularly
useful. Thus, targeting BCL6 alone or in conjunction with other signaling pathways may be a
useful therapeutic strategy for treating breast cancer.

Inappropriate expression or activation of transcription factors drives these gene expression
patterns, and cancer cells are often dependent on their continued activation. Understanding
how these oncogenic transcription factors regulate gene expression and phenotypic
characteristics of cancer cells can shed light on tumor pathogenesis, and provide insight into
strategies for rationally designed targeted therapies.

Several lines of evidence suggest that BCL6, a transcriptional repressor that is oncogenic in
B cell lymphomas, may play a role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. In addition to
maintaining the survival and blocking the terminal differentiation of lymphoma cells, BCL6
has been shown to prevent differentiation of mammary cells [1]. Through its effects on gene
regulation, BCL6 controls cellular processes including cell cycle progression, DNA damage
sensing, and protein ubiquitination [2, 3]. BCL6 is directly regulated by oncogenic STAT
transcription factors, and its expression is enhanced by inappropriately activated STAT3,
which occurs in a majority of breast cancers [4, 5]. While BCL6 is rarely detected by
immunohistochemistry in normal mammary epithelium, it is commonly expressed in breast
cancers, and has been found in 68% of high grade ductal carcinomas [1, 6]. Whether BCL6
regulates gene expression and contributes to the survival and biological properties of breast
cancer cells remains unknown.

Author Manuscript

BCL6 binds to canonical DNA sequences in the regulatory region of target genes. Once
bound, it recruits corepressor complexes that introduce repressive chromatin marks, thereby
repressing transcription [7]. For example BCL6 can recruit SMRT, NCOR, and BCOR
through its BTB domain. These repressor complexes are then able to repress a subset of
BCL6 target genes involved in cellular proliferation and survival [8–12]. BCL6 can also
interact with MTA3 through its second repression domain (RD2). Through MTA3 BCL6
represses genes involved in terminal differentiation [13, 14]. Finally, BCL6 also recruits
CtBP, through which it can repress its own expression [15, 16]. Thus, BCL6 can mediate
complex and diverse effects on gene expression.
Given these distinct interactions, the activity of BCL6 can be inhibited in specific ways. A
peptidomimetic inhibitor, RI-BPI, can prevent the recruitment of SMRT, NCoR, and BCoR
by binding to the BTB domain of BCL6 [9, 17]. Following treatment with RI-BPI, BCL6 is
still able to bind to DNA, but it can no longer repress expression of genes normally
regulated by those complexes. Importantly, RI-BPI kills diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell
lines and patient samples [9, 17], demonstrating that genes derepressed by RI-BPI are
important for the survival of DLBCL cells. In addition, RI-BPI treatment is effective in B
cell lymphoma models in vivo, while having no apparent toxicity in mice [17]. These
findings suggest that BCL6 is an appealing therapeutic target.

Given the potential role of BCL6 in the biology of breast cancer cells, we analyzed the
genomic binding patterns of BCL6 in breast cancer cell lines. We also determined the role of
BCL6 on gene expression and survival of breast cancer cells, and assessed its potential as a
therapeutic target in breast cancer.

Given the suggestion that BCL6 might play a role in breast cancer pathogenesis, we wanted
to determine if the BCL6 locus was amplified in primary human breast tumors. Using data
derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found that 51% of the 790 breast
tumors analyzed showed amplification of the BCL6 locus, while only a small subset (11%)
showed a reduction of this locus (Figure 1a). The skewing towards increased copy number
showed a nominal p value of .056 compared to 1,000 randomly chosen sites. This finding
raised the possibility that overexpression of BCL6 may be important in breast cancer
pathogenesis. Next, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [18] to analyze
BCL6 copy number and mRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines. We found that the
majority of breast cancer cell lines also displayed amplification of this locus (p=0.01)
(Figure 1b), and this was evident in lines derived from all three subtypes of breast cancer
(Supplementary Figure 1a). In addition, greater than 75% of the cell lines showed enhanced
expression of BCL6. Of the small number of cell lines showing a loss at this locus, most
were from triple negative breast tumors. Interestingly, however, even among this group, the
majority of lines showed increased BCL6 mRNA expression, suggesting that there is a
strong selective pressure for expression of this gene (Supplementary Figure 1a). To better
understand the role BCL6 plays in breast cancer, we chose a panel of breast cancer cells
containing both amplifications and deletions of this locus, and which represented the three
major classes of breast cancer: hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+), Her2/ErbB2
amplified (Her2+), and ER−/PR−/Her2− (triple negative) (Figure 1c). We then analyzed the
expression of BCL6 mRNA (Figure 1d) and protein (supplementary figure 1b) in these lines,
compared to non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial lines. We found that BCL6 was
expressed to varying degrees in 10 of the 11 breast cancer cells lines analyzed and there was
generally less expression of BCL6 in non-tumorigenic breast lines compared to the breast
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1b). Expression levels did not correlate with a
specific breast cancer subtype. We further analyzed levels of nuclear BCL6 expression and
found that BCL6 was present to varying degrees in the nucleus of all ten breast cancer cell
lines tested (Figure 1e). BCL6 becomes post-translationally modified [19] and runs across a
range of molecular weights. To ensure analysis of the correct band from protein extracts, we
treated cells with siRNA to BCL6 or control and performed immunoblots to BCL6 on
nuclear extracts. This confirmed that BCL6 is expressed in all eight of the breast cancer cell
lines analyzed (Figure 1f). Thus, BCL6 is expressed in nearly all breast cancer cell lines
tested, and the locus is amplified in approximated half of primary human breast tumors and
the majority of breast cancer cell lines. We chose to focus on T-47D, SK-BR-3, and MDAMB-468 cells for further study as they represent the three different subtypes of breast cancer
and also reflect three different levels of BCL6 expression.
BCL6 binds to unique genomic sites in breast cancer cells
To determine the function of BCL6 in breast cancer cells, we next sought to identify its
target genes in this tumor type. Although binding sites for BCL6 have been identified in B
cell lymphoma cells [2, 3], it was not known whether BCL6 binding sites would be similar
in breast cancer cells. We performed ChIP in SK-BR-3, T-47D, and MDA-MB-468 breast

cancer cell lines, and first analyzed previously characterized BCL6 binding sites. We found
that BCL6 binds to the well-characterized BCL6 binding site within the BCL6 gene itself,
the so-called region B [20] as well as the promoter of the CIS gene (Figure 2a and data not
shown). Having confirmed BCL6 localization to these sites, we then analyzed 12 BCL6
binding sites that had been defined in lymphoma cells [2, 3]. We found that only two of
these sites were bound by BCL6 in only one of three breast cancer cell lines tested (Figure
2a and data not shown). This suggested that while some of the BCL6 binding sites in breast
cancer cells overlap with those identified in lymphoma cells, there was likely to be a unique
pattern of binding of BCL6 in breast cancer.

To analyze BCL6 binding in breast cancer on a genomic scale, we performed ChIP followed
by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). Given that we had validated strong binding of BCL6 to four
sites in SK-BR-3 cells, we chose to perform ChIP-seq in this cell line. Using a p value of
10−6 as a cutoff, we identified 4118 BCL6 binding sites. Analysis of the sequences within
the peaks using a de novo motif search identified the BCL6 motif (Figure 2b). In addition,
analysis of known motifs through the TRANSFAC database also identified the BCL6
binding site as one of the top binding sites found within these sequences (p value = 9.33 ×
10−18). Together this suggests that this approach identified bona fide BCL6 binding sites.
Analysis of BCL6 localization revealed that 42% of the binding sites are within introns of
genes and 47% of the sites are located in regions that are greater than 3,000 base pairs from
the transcription start site. Only 7% of the sites are within the first 3,000 base pairs 5’ from
the start site of genes, the traditional promoter regions (Figure 2c). Similar distribution of
binding has been described for other transcriptional modulators [21, 22]. Quantitative ChIP
analysis was performed on 20 of the most highly bound sites identified by ChIP-seq (with a
false discovery rate of 0). All 20 of these sites (18 new sites and two known sites) were
bound by BCL6 in SK-BR-3 cells with at least 2 fold binding over background (i.e.,
genomic regions known not to be bound by BCL6) (Figure 2d). In addition, comparison of
binding of these sites in cell lines representing the three major classes of breast cancer types
determined that most, but not all of the sites, were bound by BCL6 in all three cell lines,
though to varying levels (Figure 2d). This suggests that some differences in BCL6 function
may occur in the different subtypes of breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether BCL6 target genes in breast cancer cells were distinct from those in
B-cell lymphomas we performed ChIP-seq for BCL6 in the OCI-LY1 diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma cell line. We then compared the genes containing at least one peak in each cell
line. From this analysis, we determined that one sixth of the genes bound by BCL6 in
lymphoma cells also show BCL6 binding in breast cancer cells (Figure 2e). Conversely,
about half of the potential BCL6 target genes in breast cancer cells are bound by BCL6 in
lymphoma cells, and half are unique to the breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that
BCL6 has both similar and distinct functions in breast cancer and lymphoma.
To validate that these sites are bona fide functional BCL6 binding sites important for gene
regulation, we knocked down BCL6 with siRNA (Figure 3a). Focusing initially on the
BCL6 binding site within the BCL6 locus (region B), we determined that siRNA to BCL6
reduced BCL6 binding to this site by approximately 75% (Figure 3a). In addition, knocking
down BCL6 also resulted in an increase of RNA polymerase II binding and an increase in

acetylated histone H4, consistent with the loss of a repressive effect of BCL6 on
transcription at this site. Similar results were seen in MDA-MB-468 cells, and there was a
more modest increase in RNA polymerase II binding in T-47D cells (Supplementary Figure
2a). Analysis of the newly identified BCL6 binding sites demonstrated that binding of BCL6
was reduced at 17 of the 18 sites upon introduction of siRNA to BCL6 (Figure 3b). In
addition, RNA polymerase was recruited to most but not all of the sites with depletion of
BCL6. These findings provide additional evidence that the sites identified by ChIP-seq in
breast cancer cells are likely to be functional BCL6 binding sites.
BCL6 binding is associated with modulation of gene expression

Author Manuscript

To directly measure the effect of BCL6 binding on gene expression in breast cancer cells,
we first transfected a BCL6 responsive luciferase reporter into SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468,
and T-47D breast cancer cells (Figure 3c and supplementary figure 2b). Ectopic expression
of BCL6 reduced expression of luciferase, demonstrating that this reporter is repressed by
BCL6. Conversely, knocking down BCL6 with siRNA resulted in increased luciferase
expression. Finally, forced re-expression of BCL6 in the presence of siRNA to BCL6 again
led to repression of luciferase activity. Additionally, the small molecule BCL6 inhibitor 79-6
[23] also resulted in increased luciferase activity in all three cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 2c), further demonstrating that BCL6 is active in these cells and that inhibiting BCL6
results in derepression of this reporter construct.

Author Manuscript

Having determined that BCL6 represses expression of a BCL6 responsive reporter in breast
cancer cells, we next determined the effects of BCL6 on endogenous genes. We utilized
siRNA to deplete cells of BCL6, then analyzed the expression of target genes identified by
ChIP-seq. PRDM1, a well-described BCL6 target gene, served as a control (Figure 3d).
Analysis of four of the newly identified BCL6 target genes demonstrated that three of the
genes are repressed by BCL6 (HERC5, KLF6, and SH3PXD2B), while the fourth, MED24,
is upregulated by BCL6 in SK-BR-3 cells (Figure 3d), confirming these as bona fide BCL6
regulated genes in breast cancer cells. While BCL6 is generally thought to be a
transcriptional repressor, BCL6 may also be involved in upregulating a subset of genes such
as MED24. In eight additional diverse breast cancer cell lines, depletion of BCL6 led to
decreased expression of MED24 in all, and generally increased expression of the other three
newly identified target genes (Supplementary Figure 3).
BCL6 is required for survival of breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Having found that BCL6 has unique effects on gene expression in breast cancer cells, we
wanted to determine the biological effects of BCL6 in these cells. We found that reducing
the levels of BCL6 by RNA interference caused a distinct morphologic change in MCF-7
and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, compared to control (Supplementary Figure 4a). The
cells appeared to be more vacuolated, and displayed less cell-cell adhesion. We next
examined viable cell number over time in culture. Depletion of BCL6 by RNAi led to a
lower population doubling rate and a lower plateau density compared to cells treated with
control siRNA (Figure 4a). Analysis of a variety of breast cancer cell lines upon BCL6
depletion demonstrated reduced cell number compared to control cells (Figure 4b). To
further evaluate the role of BCL6 on breast cancer cell survival and proliferation, we

performed replating assays. Cells in which BCL6 had been depleted displayed a significant
reduction in plating efficiency (Supplementary Figure 4b), providing further evidence for
the important role of this protein.

Author Manuscript

BCL6 has a cognate binding site that overlaps with that of the STAT family of transcription
factors including STAT3, a transcription factor also known to play an oncogenic role in
breast cancer. We have found that STAT3 is activated in the majority of triple negative
breast cancer cell lines but not in lines derived from the other subtypes [24]. Therefore, we
considered the possibility that BCL6 and STAT3 played complementary roles in triple
negative breast cancer cellular function. In MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, which contain
activated STAT3 (Supplementary Figure 5), we knocked down BCL6 or STAT3 by RNAi
and measured cell viability. Knockdown of either BCL6 or STAT3 led to a reduction in
relative viability in these cells compared to cells treated with a control siRNA (Figure 4c).
Forced over-expression of BCL6 rescued most of the loss of viability caused by knocking
down BCL6 (Figure 4d). By contrast, ectopic expression of STAT3 had no effect on the
viability of cells in which BCL6 had been knocked down. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate that BCL6 plays a unique role in promoting breast cancer cell survival.
Pharmacological targeting of BCL6 decreases viability of breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Since BCL6 promotes breast cancer cell survival, we wanted to determine if targeting BCL6
using the peptidomimetic inhibitor RI-BPI would have therapeutic benefit [17]. To
determine if this molecule was exerting a mechanism-specific effect, we first analyzed the
expression of BCL6 target genes after RI-BPI treatment. Since RI-BPI disrupts the
interaction of corepressors that bind the BTB domain of BCL6, only genes that are repressed
through this mechanism should be affected by this compound. Therefore, we treated MDAMB-468 cells with RI-BPI, and analyzed gene expression. We found that RI-BPI, but not a
control peptide, increased expression of PRDM1, KLF6, and SH3PXD2B, (Figure 5a).
Furthermore, MED24, which is upregulated by BCL6, showed decreased expression
following RI-BPI treatment. Similar results were seen in T-47D and SK-BR-3 cells
(Supplementary Figure 6a). These findings demonstrate that, as expected, RI-BPI inhibits
some but not all BCL6 transcriptional function in breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

We next treated cells derived from each major subtype of breast cancer with RI-BPI and
measured cell viability. All of the lines showed a similar dose dependent loss of viability in
response to RI-BPI with an IC50 of approximately 10 µM, whereas treatment with a control
peptide had no effect (Figure 5b). In addition, treatment of breast cancer cells with RI-BPI
led to apoptosis as measured by PARP cleavage (Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure 6b)
and annexin V/PI positivity (Figure 5d). Importantly, after knocking down BCL6 by siRNA,
RI-BPI caused no additional loss of viability. This supports the hypothesis that the effect of
RI-BPI is mediated solely through BCL6 (Figure 5e). Treatment of additional triple negative
breast cancer cells demonstrated that they were all sensitive to RI-BPI to varying degrees
(Supplementary Figure 6c). The degree of sensitivity to RI-BPI did not always correlate
with levels of nuclear BCL6 expression (Figure 1e), and may relate to other cell-specific
factors such as such as the binding of BCL6 to specific binding sites, differences in
intracellular accumulation of the inhibitors, or disparate distributions of BCL6 among the

cells in a given cell line. The small molecule BCL6 inhibitor 79-6 also reduced the cell
viability of a variety of breast cancer cell lines, indicating that this is a mechanism-specific
effect (Supplementary Figure 7).

Author Manuscript

About 70% of breast tumors contain activated STAT3, which is known to promote survival,
proliferation, and self-renewal of breast cancer cells [4, 24, 25]. Therefore, we determined if
combinations of a STAT3 inhibitor and the BCL6 inhibitor RI-BPI showed enhanced effects
in killing breast cancer cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells with the
STAT3 inhibitor nifuroxazide [26] resulted in a decrease in STAT3 target gene expression
(Supplementary Figure 8a) and a decrease in cell viability (Supplementary Figure 8b).
Combining nifuroxazide with RI-BPI resulted in an additive loss of cell viability
(Supplementary Figure 8b). In addition, reducing the levels of BCL6 with siRNA also
sensitized breast cancer cells to nifuroxazide, providing further evidence that inhibiting
STAT3 and BCL6 may be an effective combination for breast cancer therapy, particularly in
triple negative tumors (Supplementary Figure 8c). Importantly, this effect was seen for the
triple negative cell line MDA-MB-468, but there was no effect for the ER/PR positive cell
line T-47D and only a slight enhancement for Her2 positive SK-BR-3 cells, which parallels
the STAT3 phosphorylation status of these cells [24].

Author Manuscript

The activation of STAT3 in breast cancer cells is commonly dependent on Jak2, which is
also a potential target in breast cancer therapy. Thus, we determined if depleting Jak2 also
had an effect on cell viability in combination with BCL6 inhibition. We found that reducing
the levels of Jak2 in MDA-MB-468 cells with siRNA inhibited STAT3 target gene
expression (Supplementary Figure 8d) and led to an approximately 50% decrease in viable
cell number (Figure 5f). Dual knockdown of BCL6 and Jak2 lead to enhanced loss of
viability compared to either knockdown alone (Figure 5f). In addition, combining
knockdown of Jak2 with the BCL6 inhibitor RI-BPI led to approximately an 80% reduction
in viable cell number (Figure 5g). Next, we assessed the effects of the Jak2 inhibitor
TG101348 [27, 28] with BCL6 inhibition. As expected, TG101348 inhibited STAT3 target
gene expression in MDA-MB-468 cells (Supplementary Figure 9a). Treatment of breast
cancer cells transfected with siRNA to BCL6 with TG101348 resulted in enhanced loss of
cell viability of MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 5h) and SK-BR-3 cells (Supplementary Figure
9b). Similarly, combining TG101348 with RI-BPI resulted in significant loss of viability
compared to either treatment alone (Figure 5i). As expected, the Jak inhibitor TG101348 had
little effect on T-47D cells, which lack constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation (Supplementary
Figure 9b). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that BCL6 is important for breast
cancer cell survival, and that inhibition of BCL6 with RI-BPI, alone or in combination with
other therapies, may be an important therapeutic approach for breast cancer.

Discussion
We have demonstrated that BCL6 is expressed in most breast cancer cells lines and that its
genetic locus is amplified in approximately 50% of breast tumor samples and the majority of
breast cancer cell lines. In addition, BCL6 is important for breast cancer cell survival.
Targeting BCL6 with peptidomimetic or small molecule inhibitors kills breast cancer cells
alone and in combination with STAT3 or Jak2 inhibitors.

Performing whole genome ChIP-seq allowed us to identify BCL6 binding sites in breast
cancer cells. When the genes associated with these sites were compared to the genes bound
by BCL6 in B cell lymphomas, there was only limited overlap between the two groups
(Figure 2e). This suggests that BCL6 has both overlapping and distinct roles in these two
cell types. Why BCL6 does not bind to the same sites in the two different cell types raises
several interesting hypotheses, and clearly indicates that DNA sequence alone is not
sufficient to specify transcription factor binding in the context of chromatin. Other sources
of tissue specific differences may include alterations in DNA itself, such as methylation, or
modifications of histones by methylation or acetylation. Further analysis of these factors
may provide important information about the mechanism by which BCL6 regulates gene
expression differently in distinct tissues.

Author Manuscript

The interaction of BCL6 with corepressors may also be distinct in breast cancer compared to
other tissue types. The well characterized BCL6 target gene PRDM1 has been shown to be
repressed by BCL6 interaction with MTA3 in lymphoma cells [13]. MTA3 is also expressed
in breast cancer cells and is important for regulating invasiveness [29]. However, in breast
cancer cells, we have found that the BCL6 inhibitor RI-BPI, which prevents the interaction
with SMRT, leads to upregulation of PRDM1 (Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure 6a).
This suggests that SMRT is involved in regulation of PRDM1 in breast cancer cells. Blimp1,
the protein encoded by the PRDM1 gene, has been shown to be involved in breast cancer
and represses ERα [30], whereas in B cells Blimp1 promotes plasma cell differentiation
[13]. The reason for difference in the regulation of PRDM1 between these two cell types is
unclear and warrants further study.

Author Manuscript

We have found that BCL6 is expressed in 10 of 11 breast cancer cell lines tested
(Supplementary Figure 1b). Interestingly, expression of BCL6 was not restricted to any one
breast cancer cell type. Therefore, we analyzed BCL6 binding in all three types of breast
cancer cells and determined that while many of the sites are shared between the three major
classes of breast cancer, there are also distinct differences between the cells. Additionally,
the responses to siRNA and drug treatment also had some distinct differences, with the triple
negative MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells responding more than the other cell types. This
raises the possibility that triple negative breast tumors may be more sensitive to targeting
BCL6, and therefore, may benefit more strongly from treatment with a BCL6 inhibitor. This
may be particularly important as these tumors often become resistant to chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

Treating breast cancer cells with RI-BPI leads to loss of cell viability and induction of
apoptosis (Figure 5c and d, and Supplementary Figure 6b). This suggests that targeting
BCL6 may be an important new strategy for cancer therapy. In addition, the combination of
RI-BPI with inhibition of another transcription factor, STAT3, also showed promise
(Supplementary Figure 8b). Over 70% of breast tumors have activation of STAT3 [4, 25],
and STAT3 activation is highly associated with triple negative breast tumors [24].
Therefore, triple negative breast tumors may particularly benefit from the combination of
STAT3 and BCL6 inhibitors. STAT3 can also directly increase expression of BCL6 in
breast cancer cells [4]. Thus, this combination may not only show efficacy by inhibiting the
function of each transcription factor alone, but inhibiting STAT3 may also reduce the levels
of BCL6 expression, providing a further level of inhibition of BCL6 in these triple negative

breast cancer cells. Additionally, Jak inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials for triple
negative breast cancer. We have found that the combination of the Jak2 inhibitor TG101348
with BCL6 inhibition reduces viability of breast cancer cells more than either approach
alone (Figure 5h and i). Therefore, combinations of Jak inhibitors and RI-BPI or other BCL6
inhibitors may also be an effective treatment strategy for breast cancer. Ultimately, it will be
important to confirm these findings in in vivo systems.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that BCL6 is an important transcriptional regulator in
breast cancer, and that targeting BCL6 induces apoptosis in these cells. About half of the
genes to which BCL6 binds in breast cancer cells are unique when compared to lymphoma
cells, indicating that BCL6 likely mediates some unique effects in breast cancer. As BCL6 is
expressed in all three major classes of breast cancer, developing targeted therapies to BCL6
may be an important new avenue for breast cancer therapy.

RNA interference

Author Manuscript

Breast cancer cells were reverse transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMax
(Invitrogen) at 10 nM unless otherwise indicated for the indicated times. RNAi included
siControl (D-001210-03, Dharmacon), siBCL6#1 (HSS100968, Invitrogen), siBCL6#2
(HSS100966, Invitrogen), siSTAT3 (M-003544-02, Dharmacon), and siJak2
(M-003146-02-0005, Dharmacon). Rescue experiments were performed with the
combination transfection of siRNA and expression plasmids for pRcCMV STAT3 or
pCDNA3 BCL6.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

ChIP was performed essentially as described [35]. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for
10 minutes, sonicated, and lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with 2 µg of
antibodies to BCL6 (sc-858) and RNA polymerase II (sc-9001) from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology or acetyl H4 from Cell Signaling Technology. ChIP product was measured
using Quant-iT™ dsDNA HS Assay (Invitrogen), and equal amounts of product and input
were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Data are expressed as fold binding over background
(using both input and genomic regions known not to be bound by BCL6, including the
rhodopsin gene and a previously defined control region found within the BCL6 gene [20]).
For siRNA ChIPs, 7.5×106 SK-BR-3, T-47D, or MDA-MB-468 cells were plated and ChIP
was performed 72 hours after reverse transfection. ChIP product was analyzed by qPCR
using the indicate primers (Supplementary Table 1 or as described [3]). OCI-Ly1 ChIP was
performed essentially as above except cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1%
v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% w/v deoxycholate, 0.1% w/v SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 8, and 5 mM
EDTA).
ChIP-seq

Author Manuscript

Libraries for ChIP-seq were created from 10 ng of BCL6 ChIP and 10 ng of corresponding
input in SK-BR-3 cells according to the manufacture’s protocol (Illumina), with size
selection of 250–400 base pairs. ChIP-seq was performed with a SR36bp run. Sequences
were aligned to the human genome (UCSC hg18) using ELAND. Peaks were defined using
MACS [36]. Motifs were identified using both the de novo motifs search and the
TRANSFAC database using the SeqPos motif tool [37]. Binding site analysis and annotation
was performed using CEAS [38]. Analysis tools were from the Galaxy/Cistrome website
(http://cistrome.org). ChIP-seq was performed essentially as above for the OCI-LY1 cells.
For comparisons between BCL6 binding in breast cancer and lymphoma cells, only
sequences mapping uniquely to the genome with not more than two mismatches were used,
and peaks were assigned using ChIPseeqer [39] for both datasets. Each dataset was
compared to its own input control.

Luciferase reporter analysis

Author Manuscript

Breast cancer cells were reverse transfected with siRNA. The following day, (BCL6)4-TKLuc was transfected into breast cancer cells in combination with renilla luciferase using
Lipofectamine 2000. These were alone or with vector or pCDNA3-BCL6. Luciferase was
analyzed as described [20]. For cells treated with 79-6, breast cancer cells were transfected
with BCL6-Luc for 6 hours and then treated with 300 µM 79-6 for 16 hours.
RT-PCR
RT-PCR was performed as described [4]. mRNA primer sequences are as indicated
(Supplementary Table 2).
Immunoblots and nuclear extracts

Author Manuscript

Immunoblotting was performed as described [26] using the following antibodies: PARP
(9542, Cell Signaling); tubulin (T-5168; Sigma); BCL6 (sc-858; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
HSP90 (sc-13119, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), P-STAT3 (9131, Cell Signaling
Technology), STAT3 (sc- 482, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and actin (Sigma). Nuclear
extracts were generated using the Nuclear Extract Kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Viable cell number quantitation and clonogenic assays

Author Manuscript

Breast cancer cells were plated in 384 or 96 well plates for viability in duplicate or
quadruplicate. Cells were treated with drug for the indicated time and viable cell number
was measured using an ATP dependent luciferase assay (CellTiterGlo, Promega), and
expressed relative to control or vehicle treated cells. For siRNA knockdown, breast cancer
cells were reverse transfected and then analyzed on the indicated day. For growth assays,
cell number was measured daily by CellTiterGlo and normalized to day one values. For
clonogenic assays, cells were reverse transfected with siRNA. The following day, 500 cells
were seeded in 6 well dishes. After 10–14 days, colonies were visualized by staining with a
6% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% crystal violet solution.
Apoptosis assay
Breast cancer cells were treated with vehicle or 15 µM BPI for 48 hours and analyzed for
annexin/PI staining (BD Biosciences) by flow cytometry.
