Abstract
Cancer cells can undergo a metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis that allows
them to adapt to nutrient-poor microenvironments, thereby imposing a selection for aggressive variants.
However, the mechanisms underlying this reprogramming are not fully understood. Using complementary
approaches in validated cell lines and freshly obtained human specimens, we report here that mitochondrial
respiration and oxidative phosphorylation are slowed in metastatic melanomas, even under normoxic conditions
due to the persistence of a high nuclear expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a). Pharmacologic or
genetic blockades of the HIF-1a pathway decreased glycolysis and promoted mitochondrial respiration via
speciﬁc reduction in the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3 (PDK3). Inhibiting PDK3 activity by
dichloroacetate (DCA) or siRNA-mediated attenuation was sufﬁcient to increase pyruvate dehydrogenase
activity, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. Notably, DCA
potentiated the antitumor effects of elesclomol, a pro-oxidative drug currently in clinical development, both
by limiting cell proliferation and promoting cell death. Interestingly, this combination was also effective against
BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma cells that were resistant to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Cotreatment of
melanomas with DCA and elesclomol in vivo achieved a more durable response than single agent alone. Our
ﬁndings offer a preclinical validation of the HIF-1/PDK3 bioenergetic pathway as a new target for therapeutic
intervention in metastatic melanoma, opening the door to innovative combinations that might eradicate this
disease. Cancer Res; 72(19); 5035–47. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Over the last decades, huge efforts devoted to comprehend
melanoma biology led to the identiﬁcation of new targets for
antimelanoma therapy (1). Apart from targeting the oncogenic
mutations present in many (but certainly not all) melamomas,
another promising strategy is to exploit biochemical particularities of melanoma cells. One biochemical hallmark of melanoma is the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species

(ROS; refs. 2, 3). It is generally postulated that the cellular
effects of ROS depend on the level at which ROS are produced.
Controlled production of ROS participates in the promotion
and progression of melanoma (3), whereas higher ROS generation displays cell-damaging effects (4). Constitutive production of the ROS weakens melanoma cells that are closer to the
point where cell death can occur. Hence, melanoma cells show
increased sensitivity to ROS-induced death as compared with
melanocytes and to other tumors (5). According to this view,
elesclomol, a pro-oxidant molecule that targets the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC; ref. 6), has been evaluated
in clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic melanomas and
has shown encouraging clinical responses. Intriguingly, clinical
favorable responses occurred in a subset of patients distinguished by low serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; ref. 7).
Thus, serum LDH can be considered as the predictor of
response to elesclomol. At a cellular level, elesclomol requires
a functioning ETC to induce ROS-mediated melanoma cell
death (6). In this context, unraveling the regulatory mechanisms essential for enhancing ROS production is fundamental
for improving the efﬁciency of pro-oxidants in melanoma.
Approximately, 60% to 90% of cancers display a metabolic
proﬁle, the so-called Warburg phenotype, characterized by

their dependence upon glycolysis as the major source of
energy, irrespective of the oxygen level (8). According to the
Warburg effect, pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, is
mainly converted into lactate by LDH-A that is upregulated
in transformed cells, rather than oxidized in mitochondria.
It seems conceivable that melanoma cells mainly rely on
glycolysis for energetic needs based on the following reasons:
(i) the glycolytic phenotype of melanoma cell lines has been
recently identiﬁed by metabolic proﬁling (9); (ii) metastatic
melanomas are characterized by their particularly high avidity
for 2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) clinically detectable on positron emission tomography (PET; ref. 10); (iii) the
isoenzyme LDH-5, the more effective in the conversion of
pyruvate to lactate, is detected on histologic sections and in
blood sera from patients with highly metastatic melanoma (for
review; ref. 11); and (iv) hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), a
master regulator of metabolism required for the active adaptation of cancer cells to hypoxic conditions, is overexpressed in
human melanoma (12, 13). In addition to hypoxia, HIF-1a has
also been found stabilized in normoxic conditions in melanoma cells. For instance, melanoma antigen-11 regulates HIF-1
accumulation by inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity (14).
Endothelin or the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, induces HIF-1a
accumulation (15, 16). Genetic alterations, such as Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor (MITF) germline
mutation (17) or the oncogenic V600E BRAF mutation (18)
overexpress HIF-1a and enhance transcriptional activity of
downstream genes.
However, recent studies indicate that melanomas do not
adopt a bona ﬁde Warburg phenotype, as glutamine stimulates
mitochondrial metabolism to favor melanoma growth (9, 19). It
is well established that, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1a
activates the expression of glycolytic enzymes and glucose
transporters and downregulates mitochondrial activity and
ROS production through several distinct mechanisms in a
context-speciﬁc manner (20). HIF-1a has also been involved
in the "glutamine addiction" of cancer cells (21).
Our objective was to investigate the inﬂuence of metabolic
pathways on mitochondrial ROS production, particularly in
melanoma under normoxic conditions. We hypothesized that
HIF-1a can also prevent the onset of oxidative stress via
downregulation of mitochondrial respiration, and therefore
can itself represent a factor of resistance to pro-oxidative drugs
in melanomas.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich except
CM-H2DCFDA from Life Technologies and YC-1) from Cayman
Chemical Company (Interchim). Elesclomol, provided by Synta
Pharmaceuticals Corp., was prepared as described (6). The
combined effect of dichloroacetate (DCA) and elesclomol was
analyzed by the combination index isobologram (22).
Patients and tissue samples
Cutaneous metastases were obtained from 4 melanoma
patients (see Supplementary Table S1) at the Clinique de
Dermatologie, CHRU (Lille, France). Ethical approval for this

5036

Cancer Res; 72(19) October 1, 2012

study was obtained from the local Person's Protection Committee, and all patients provided informed consent. The samples came from patients who had to be treated surgically for
cutaneous melanoma metastases.
Cell lines
HL60, A375, and SKMel-28 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection over the past 2 years. The human
melanoma cell lines HBL, LND, MM074, and MM079 were
established in the Laboratory of Oncology and Experimental
Surgery (Institut Bordet, Universite libre de Bruxelles, Brussels,
Belgium) from lymph node metastases of patients with melanoma and were kindly provided by G. Ghanem in 2009. Mel4M was established in the laboratory by Dr. Polakowska in
2009. All cells were passaged within 6 months of thawing. The
identity of cell lines was regularly examined by morphologic
criteria and the presence of differentiation markers (last test in
March 2012). They were expressing at least one of the melanocyte differentiation markers (TYR, TYRP1, TYRP2/DCT,
Melan-A/MART-1, gp100/pmel17, S100B) as routinely assessed
by Western blotting/immunoﬂuorescence. The identity of
HBL, LND, and Mel-4M was also conﬁrmed by karyotyping
and array comparative genomic hybridization testing (IRCL
and Laboratoire de genetique, CHRU, Lille, France).
All cell lines were cultured at 37 C under 5% CO2 in RPMI
medium (Gibco-BRL, Life Technologies) supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (Gibco-BRL), antibiotics, and 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate (Gibco-BRL). Cells were transfected with
siRNA targeting PDK-3 (sc-39029, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
or a nontargeting control siRNA (sc-37707) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). PDK3 overexpression in melanoma cell lines was obtained by transfection with pJP1520PDK3 vector [provided through central repository DNASU
(http://dnasu.asu.edu; ref. 23)] DCA, and/or elesclomol were
added 48 hours after transfection. HBL cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (HBL r0) were generated as published (24). The A375
cell line, which harbors the BRAFV600E mutation, was treated
with vemurafenib to obtain the resistant subline (A375-R) as
described in the Supplementary material.
HIF-1a shRNA
Three HIF-1a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones (see Supplementary material for sequences) were obtained by limiting
dilution. Activation of HIF-1a was quantiﬁed by a DNA-binding ELISA kit (TransAM Active Motif).
Determination of glucose, lactate, and ATP
Extracellular glucose and lactate levels were measured on
a SYNCHRON LX20 Clinical system (Beckman Coulter). For
assessment of intracellular ATP, the Celltiter Glow Assay Kit
(Promega) was used.
Cytoﬂuorometric analysis
Cell viability and cell cycle were assessed after staining with
propidium iodide (PI). The detection of ROS was determined
using the CM-H2DCFDA or hydroethidium probe following
current protocols (25) and conducted on a FACS Canto II
cytoﬂuorometer (Beckton Dickinson).

Targeting PDK to Enhance Oxidative Stress in Melanoma

PCR analysis
The mRNA was quantiﬁed by quantitative real-time PCR
using a protocol optimized for Lightcycler 480 detector (Roche
Applied Science; ref. 25). The primer sequences are available
upon request. The transcript level in each sample was normalized to that of 18S rRNA. The relative expression of target
mRNAs was analyzed using the Pfaﬂl method (25).
Metabolite proﬁles
Metabolites were extracted (26), and proﬁles were obtained
using the 1H-NMR method as previously described (25).
Immunoblot analysis
Immunoblotting was conducted as indicated (25). To detect
ETC proteins, monoclonal antibodies (OXPHOS complexes kit,
MitoSciences; 1:1,000) were used. Otherwise, the primary antibodies used are described in Supplementary materials.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 8 minutes
and processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assay using the HIF-1a ExactaChIP Chromatin IP Kit (R&D
Systems). Capture of the DNA fragments was tested by PCR
using PDK3 primers previously reported (27).
Measurement of oxygen consumption
Oxygen consumption was monitored with Oxygraph oxygen
electrodes (Hansatech Instruments Ltd.; ref. 25). Cell viability
was checked by PI staining. For melanoma specimens, oxygen
consumption assays were conducted using the respirometry
system Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros Instruments). Data were normalized to the dry weight of the specimens.
PDH activity and phosphoPDH detection
The determination of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and phosphorylation of PDH were conducted using the PDH
Assay Kit (MSP18, Mitosciences) and the PhosphoPDH In-Cell
ELISA Kit Colorimetric (MSP48, Mitosciences), respectively.
Transmission electron microscopy
Cells were prepared for transmission electron microscopy as
described (25).

Histology
Tumor specimens were stained with H&E. For in situ
determination of cell proliferation or apoptosis, sections were
analyzed with an antibody to Ki-67 or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL; In
Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche). As a marker of ROSmediated protein oxidation, protein carbonyls were detected
by the dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNPH) method using Oxyblot
Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (Millipore).
In vivo study
All procedures with animals were conducted according to
the Institutional guidelines. Immunodeﬁcient female severe
combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice, 6- to 8-week-old,
under isoﬂurane anesthesia were injected with 2  106 HBL
cells, mixed (1:1 volume) with BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix. When tumors reached 400 mL, the mice were
divided into 4 groups: control group (n ¼ 4): mice were treated
with saline with the same schedule as the treated animals;
elesclomol group (n ¼ 6): mice were treated with elesclomol (20
mg/kg, i.v. injection for 5 d/wk); DCA group (n ¼ 6): mice were
treated with DCA (75 mg/L added to the drinking water); DCA/
elesclomol group (n ¼ 6) mice were treated with the combination of DCA and elesclomol. For patients' tumors implanted
in mice, fresh tumor samples were minced into small pieces,
mixed (1:1 volume) with Matrigel, and then injected into the
ﬂank of SCID mice as described earlier.
Imaging microPET scan analysis
The PET experiments (authorization N 14–55) were carried
out under anesthesia. Images were acquired on a microPET
Siemens Inveon Preclinical system. The emission scan lasting 1
hour was initiated after injection of 18FDG (370 MBq/kg)
through the tail vein. To quantify the 18F-FDG uptake on the
last frame (corresponding to 40–60 min), the measured tissue
activity concentration [counts (kBq)/mL] was divided by the
injected activity in kBq per gram of body weight (kBq/g) to give
a standardized uptake value (SUV).
Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.00
(GraphPad Software). The Student t test was used to compare
data sets. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05.

Targeting PDK to Enhance Oxidative Stress in Melanoma

Results
Metabolic signature of metastatic melanoma cells
We ﬁrst examined the effects of glucose and glutamine
shortage on cell growth. In low glucose medium, HBL cells
dramatically reduced their ability to proliferate. The absence of
glutamine also limited HBL cell growth (Fig. 1A). Moreover,
melanoma cells were partially resistant to cell death induced
by the mitochondrial inhibitors (rotenone or oligomycin),
whereas maximum cell death was achieved when cells were
incubated with bromopyruvate to inhibit glycolysis. Conversely, the promyelocytic cell line, HL60, was critically dependent
on OXPHOS for survival [Fig. 1B and (28, 29)]. All melanoma
cell lines studied had a cell death proﬁle similar to that of
mitochondrial DNA–depleted melanoma cells (HBL r0), which
lack functional ETC (24). Inhibition of ATP synthase with
oligomycin had almost no impact on ATP in melanoma cells,
whereas in HL60, ATP level was highly sensitive to inhibition by
oligomycin (Fig. 1C). Thus, metastatic melanoma cells, such as
respiratory deﬁcient r0 cells, generate almost all ATP via
glycolysis despite abundant oxygen, a situation known as the
Warburg effect (30). Conﬁrming this phenotype, a high glycolytic activity as measured by glucose consumption and lactate
production characterized melanoma cells (Fig. 1D). Melanoma
cell lines also exhibited a signiﬁcantly lower oxygen consumption rate than HL60 (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the proportion of
melanoma respiration used to produce ATP (ATP turnover)
was far less important than that of HL60 (Fig. 1F). These results
were conﬁrmed in metastatic melanoma specimens from
patients (see Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig.
S1A) compared with the surrounding tissues (Fig. 1G and H).
Finally, we evaluated oxygen consumption in melanoma cells
isolated from cutaneous metastasis (patient 2) according to
the intensity of 18FDG uptake, expressed as SUVs (Fig. 1I).
Specimen taken from high-SUV area (inner zone) showed weak
respiration rate and low ATP turnover as compared with
peripheral specimen from low SUV area (Fig. 1I). Thus, the
metabolic phenotype of human melanoma is characterized by
high rates of aerobic glycolysis, dependence on glutamine, and
low mitochondrial activity.

data (12, 32), HIF-1a was expressed under normoxia in nuclei
of melanoma cells (Fig 2A and B and Supplementary Fig. S1B)
and of metastatic melanomas from patients (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). The inﬂuence of hypoxia on selective HIF-1a expression was moderate [Fig. 2A and ref. (32)]. We then used shRNA
targeting HIF-1a mRNA for knockdown of gene expression
(Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D and Fig. 2B) in the HBL cell
line selected for its elevated level of HIF-1a (Fig. 2A and B). HIF1a knockdown cells resulted in signiﬁcant decreased expression of key glycolytic genes and corresponding proteins, such
as hexokinase II, the ﬁrst step rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis and LDH-A, which converts pyruvate into lactate, the ﬁnal
product of glycolysis (Fig. 2C and D). In addition, a prominent
decrease in lactate release was observed in shRNA cells
(Fig. 2E), and HIF-1a knockdown cells were relatively resistant
to death induced by the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-DG (Fig. 2F).
Comparison of 18FDG accumulation in tumor xenografts
showed a sharply higher activity in control cells compared
with HIF-1a knockdown cells supporting the crucial role of
HIF-1a in the glucose addiction of melanoma (Fig. 2G). Moreover, HIF-1a knockdown cells were resistant to the antiproliferative effect of glutamine shortage (Fig. 2H) suggesting that
HIF-1a also contributes to the dependence of melanoma cells
on glutamine. In comparison with control cells, HBL cells
lacking HIF-1a showed a 2-fold increase in mitochondrial
oxygen consumption (Fig. 2I and Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Similar mitochondrial effects were observed when cells were
incubated with YC-1 (Fig. 2I), an established HIF-1a inhibitor
(ref. 33 and Fig. 2B). Relative to HBL scrambled cells, HIF-1a
shRNA cells presented signiﬁcantly higher levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates, accumulation of glutamine, and
lower contents of intracellular lactate as quantiﬁed by 1H-NMR
(Table 1). Derepression of mitochondrial respiration in cells
lacking HIF-1a signiﬁcantly enhanced the fraction of respiration that is used for ATP synthesis, and therefore they produced more ATP than scrambled shRNA cells (Fig. 2J). By
accomplishing these major effects on glycolysis, glutamine
metabolism, and mitochondrial respiration, HIF-1a drives the
main metabolic changes observed in melanoma.

HIF-1a is critical for the metabolic phenotype of
metastatic melanoma
As HIF-1 is a critical regulator of metabolism in cells under
hypoxic conditions (31), we studied the role of HIF-1a in
melanoma cells maintained in normoxia. Conﬁrming previous

A HIF-1a–dependent PDK3 pathway controls

We then evaluated the mechanisms by which HIF-1a downregulates mitochondrial OXPHOS. We found no change in the
shape and number of mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. S2B–

complex IV and the expression of ETC proteins were not
affected by HIF-1a expression (Supplementary Fig. S2E and
S2F). Four different PDH kinases (PDK1–4) are known to
phosphorylate the E1 moiety of the PDH complex (PDH) at
3 serine sites, thereby decreasing PDH activity and preventing
pyruvate from undergoing mitochondrial oxidation [Fig. 3A
and ref. (35)]. HIF-1a knockdown correlated with the reduced
expression of PDK3 mRNA without signiﬁcantly affecting the
related isoforms (Fig. 3B). Results were conﬁrmed at the
protein level (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S1B). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay showed the direct binding of HIF1a to the PDK3 promoter in living cells (Fig. 3D). In agreement
with the aforementioned data on PDK3 downregulation, PDH
activity was enhanced in HIF-1a knockdown cells or in melanoma cells incubated in the presence of YC-1 (Fig. 3E and
Supplementary Fig. S3). Increased PDH activity was also
observed in cells transfected with siRNA directed against PDK3
or in the presence of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)
inhibitor, DCA (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S3). Dephosphorylation of PDH in HIF-1a knockdown cells or in HBL cells
treated with DCA (Fig. 3F) correlated with the activation of
PDH.
Accordingly, exposure of HBL cells (Fig. 3G), HBL tumors
from SCID mice (Fig. 3H), or freshly resected cutaneous
metastases (Fig. 3I) to DCA resulted in a dose-dependent
increase of mitochondrial respiration regardless of the presence or absence of glutamine (Fig. 3G). No such effects were
observed in HBL r0 cells or in the OXPHOS-dependent cell line
HL60 (Fig. 3G, top left). DCA-induced increase in respiration
was abolished by overexpression of PDK3 (Fig. 3G, bottom)
suggesting that PDK3 is an important target for DCA. Moreover, DCA decreased the nuclear level of HIF-1a as well as its
target LDH-A (Fig. 3K). There was a similar trend toward
increased mitochondrial respiration in melanoma cells transfected with PDK3 siRNA (Fig. 3G, top right), comparable with
that observed for cells lacking HIF-1a (Fig. 2I). We noted a
signiﬁcant elevation in several TCA cycle intermediates, glutamine, and a low lactate content in DCA-treated cells (Fig. 3J)
mirroring the phenotype observed in HIF-1a kd cells (Table 1).
Thus, a HIF-1a/PDK3 axis contributes to the control of mitochondrial respiration observed in melanoma.
Inhibition of the HIF-1a–dependent PDK3 pathway
enhances mitochondrial ROS generation
We next decided to investigate whether the enhanced
mitochondrial respiration would lead to increased mitochondrial ROS generation. We observed a signiﬁcant increase in the
ROS levels when PDK3 activity was inhibited by siRNA or DCA
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4). Incubating PDK3 siRNAor DCA-treated HBL cells with distinct ROS inducers further
increased ROS levels. The pro-oxidative effect of DCA was
maintained after glutamine withdrawal (Fig. 4A). Remarkably,
DCA had no additional effect on ROS production in PDK3
siRNA knockdown cells, and PDK3 overexpression impeded
DCA-induced increase in ROS generation conﬁrming PDK3 as
a potential target for DCA (Fig. 4B). Consistently, exposure of
cells lacking HIF-1a to the ROS inducers also generated more
ROS than cells expressing HIF-1a (Fig. 4C and Supplementary

5042

Fig. S4). In the r0 clone, due to its lack of basal (Fig. 1E) and
DCA-induced respiration (Fig. 3G), the pro-oxidant capacities
of DCA were markedly diminished compared with HBL parental cells (Fig. 4D). The complex I inhibitor, rotenone, dramatically decreased DCA-induced ROS generation in the same
manner as the classic antioxidants, vitamin C and N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC; Fig. 4E). It must be noted that apocynin, a
classic inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, which has also predominant antioxidant capacities (36), reduced DCA-stimulated
ROS production with about 40% ROS inhibition. The inhibitor
of complex III, antimycin A, also reduced ROS production when
combined with DCA, whereas the complex IV and V inhibitors
had no noticeable effects (Fig. 4E). This would indicate that
mitochondrial ROS promoted by DCA originated from complex I and/or III. Altogether, our results suggest that the HIF1a/PDK3 axis protects melanoma from mitochondrial ROS
production.
Inhibition of the PDK3-dependent HIF-1a pathway
promotes antimelanoma activity of elesclomol
Finally, we investigated whether mitochondrial ROS generation promoted by DCA and elesclomol had potent antimelanoma activities. The combination of DCA and elesclomol
inhibited cell viability more than each treatment did alone
(Fig. 5A–C and Supplementary Fig. S5). In congruence with
these ﬁndings, PDK3 inhibition rendered HBL cells highly
sensitive to elesclomol-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Selected concentration curves indicate a synergistic effect
for HBL cells when DCA was combined with elesclomol (Fig.
5A). Interestingly, combination of DCA and elesclomol was
sufﬁcient to induce oxidative cell death in A375 melanoma cells
with acquired resistance to vemurafenib (Fig. 5D).
To explore the therapeutic usefulness of pharmacologic
combination, we sought to determine whether DCA treatment
sensitized HBL xenografts to elesclomol in vivo. DCA or elesclomol alone reduced growth of HBL xenografts (Fig. 5E). In
comparison, the combination of DCA and elesclomol was more
effective in delaying tumor growth than single agent alone.
Very similar results were obtained in a preclinical model
consisting to evaluate the response of human tumor fragments
grafted into SCID mice to drug combination (Fig. 5F). Treatment of mice with the combination of DCA and elesclomol was
more effective in accumulating oxidatively modiﬁed proteins,
reducing cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis of HBL
xenografts than single agent alone (Fig. 5G). Altogether, these
data suggest that the antimelanoma activity of elesclomol,
although effective alone, can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by DCA.

Discussion
Our results show that melanoma cells use mainly glycolysis,
and not mitochondria, for energy production and cell proliferation. In agreement with other reports (9, 19), we observed
that glutamine also supports melanoma cell growth. Glucose
and glutamine metabolic pathways are able to compensate
from one another to promote cancer cell survival (37, 38).
However, unlike the model originally stipulated by Warburg
(39), melanoma cells maintain functional mitochondria. Thus,

Targeting PDK to Enhance Oxidative Stress in Melanoma

we showed that inhibition of the HIF-1a/PDK3 axis is able to
restore respiration in mitochondria of melanoma cells. These
ﬁndings conﬁrm that cancer cells possess a highly adaptable
metabolism. Reduction in LDH-A activity (40) causes derepression of mitochondrial respiration (25). Inhibition of PDK
favors mitochondrial oxidation and ROS production in lung
carcinoma (41). Forced oxidative metabolism interferes with
tumor cells proliferation and survival (25, 40, 41). Thereby, the
metabolic ﬂexibility of cancer cells creates a new perspective
for the development of therapeutic approaches.
HIF-1a has been found highly expressed in melanoma cells
kept under normoxic conditions (12, 32). The elevated expression of HIF-1a is correlated with the advanced stage of
melanoma (12). Our results are consistent with the view that
melanoma progression is associated with the apparition of
changes in mitochondrial metabolism in a HIF-1a dependent
manner. Conversely, nonmetastatic primary melanomas upregulate genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (42).
Our study deﬁnes the HIF-1a/PDK3 axis as a sensor for
metabolic stress that regulates mitochondrial ROS level under
normoxia. Overexpression of HIF-1a reduces the basal level of
ROS in hypoxic cancer cells (43). The isoenzyme PDK3 is
expressed in several cancer cells, such as neuroblastoma, colon
cancer (27), or leukemia (25). Hypoxic activation of the PDK3dependent HIF-1a pathway has been previously involved in
tumor progression and drug resistance (27). In agreement with
our ﬁndings, the transcription proﬁling of human cancer cell
lines conﬁrmed the high expression of PDK3 in melanomas
(deposited in Array Express database, accession number EMTAB-37). PDK3 is the only isoform reported to be not
inhibited by a high concentration of pyruvate (44). Interestingly, high pyruvate and lactate concentrations result in
nonhypoxic HIF-1a stabilization (45). Thus, as suggested
(45), HIF-1a-mediated PDK3 expression may favor HIF-1a
stabilization independently of hypoxia in a self-amplifying loop
that contributes to locking the melanoma cell metabolism into
aerobic glycolysis.
Our ﬁndings provide an attractive explanation for the predictive value of LDH in patients treated with elesclomol (7).
Because LDH-A is transcriptionally regulated by HIF-1a (Fig.
2C and D), serum LDH may be considered as an indirect
marker of the HIF-1a–mediated defective mitochondrial activity. In that way, we propose that tumors from patients with
high LDH levels have also inactive mitochondria, a situation
that we found associated with resistance to elesclomolinduced cell death in vitro (6). Under such conditions, inhibition of HIF-1a and LDH expression by DCA (Fig. 3K) can
contribute to restore sensitivity to elesclomol. Finally, we have
shown that combined inhibitors of the HIF-1a/PDK3 axis
along with pro-oxidant drugs have potential antimelanoma
capacities. The hypoxia-independent activation of HIF-1a,
found in certain metastatic melanomas (such as those with
activation of the MITF pathway or harboring BRAF mutation),
would confer particular sensitivity to this drug combination.
Thus, in line with our results, this new therapeutic approach
would be likely beneﬁcial to patients progressing on BRAF
inhibitors.

To best translate in vitro results into clinical application,
we have chosen the combination of existing drugs (DCA
and elesclomol) that are already in the clinic. Elesclomol is
one of the ﬁrst mitochondrial-targeted drugs that has
recently entered the clinical trials (7). Elesclomol does not
act by speciﬁc targeting of mitochondrial proteins but most
likely by interfering with the electron ﬂow to promote
mitochondrial ROS production (6). Thus, we have shown
that the DCA-dependent enhancement of the electron ﬂow
impaired by elesclomol results in huge production of ROS.
DCA, previously used to treat mitochondrial diseases without major toxicity, is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for cancer (46). DCA irreversibly inhibits all PDK
isoenzymes (47). We have shown that knocking down
HIF-1a markedly reduced PDK3 expression but not other
isoenzymes under normoxic conditions (Fig. 3B). However,
both PDK1 and PDK3 were upregulated under hypoxic
conditions (not shown), and it has been proven that PDK1
prevents the overproduction of mitochondrial ROS in
response to hypoxia (48, 49). Because solid tumors consist
of both normoxic and hypoxic regions, the use of a broadspectrum inhibitor of all 4 PDK isoenzymes, such as DCA, is
of particular interest in vivo to fully reactivate mitochondria. However, the main disadvantage of DCA, when used
alone, is that its in vivo antitumor activity is only apparent
at high concentrations (46). Our results suggest that DCA
can be also used in combination regimen to boost the
mitochondrial electron ﬂux and then potentiate the antitumor activity of pro-oxidant drugs, such as elesclomol.
Thus, our results offer proof-of-concept for using elesclomol
combined with DCA against metastatic melanoma including those who have become resistant to BRAF inhibitors.
In conclusion, inactivation of the HIF-1a/PDK3 axis presents new therapeutic opportunities against metastatic
melanoma.
