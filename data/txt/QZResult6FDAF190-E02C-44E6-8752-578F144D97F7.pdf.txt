ABSTRACT
The major regulators of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell growth
and survival mediate their effects through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K)/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We have shown that the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus extended survival in a non-obese diabetic/severe combined
immune-deficient (NOD/SCID) mouse xenograft model of human ALL. Since PI-3K
has mTOR dependent and independent functions we examined the effect of the dual
PI-3K/mTOR inhibitors BEZ235 and BGT226. These agents inhibited the proliferation
of ALL cell lines with a three log greater potency than everolimus. However, the
induction of cell death differed, with BGT226 being cytotoxic in the low micromolar
range while a two log higher concentration of BEZ235 was required to produce the
same effect. While all three agents extended the survival of NOD/SCID mice engrafted
with human ALL, the responses of individual xenografts varied. Although differential
phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473 and Thr308 in response to everolimus exposure was
observed, this did not entirely explain the different in vivo responses to the drugs.
Our data suggests that while dual PI-3K/mTOR inhibitors may improve therapeutic
outcomes for a subset of ALL patients, patient selection will be important, with some
patients likely to respond better to single mTOR inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

ALL cells are highly dependent on bone marrow
stromal support for in vitro proliferation and survival [5],
and bone marrow stroma can provide protection from
the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents [6],
an effect at least partly mediated by chemokine (C-X-C
motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) [7]. We have demonstrated
that signaling through PI-3K/AKT/mTOR is crucial
for proliferative responses of ALL cells to CXCL12,
interleukin (IL)-7 and unknown stroma-derived mediators
[8]. In addition, constitutive activation of the PI-3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway has been observed in hematological
malignancies including ALL [9], making the PI-3K/mTOR
pathway a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of
this disease.
We and others have shown that the mTOR inhibitors
everolimus, rapamycin, CCI-779 or AZD8055, suppress
proliferation, induce cell death and extend survival of
NOD/SCID mice engrafted with human ALL [10-13].

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most
common childhood cancer and a major cause of death in
children. Although pediatric ALL is highly responsive to
chemotherapy, relapse occurs in approximately 25% of
children with ALL [1]. The majority of adults diagnosed
with ALL relapse following treatment and their outlook
is bleak, with further treatment including hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation producing less than 10% overall
survival at 5 years [2, 3]. In addition, the relatively
non-specific actions of anti-cancer drugs often result in
unacceptable toxicities that can occasionally prove fatal,
or produce life long consequences for survivors [4]. The
inability to further intensify current treatments in highrisk patients due to dose limiting toxicities means that
new agents are required for further significant increases
in overall survival.

However, signaling events elicited by PI-3K and mTOR
are complex and although overlapping, have non-identical
functions that regulate cell growth and survival [14-18].
Inhibitors of mTOR disrupt mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1),
inhibiting phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase
(S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E
binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), while PI-3K signals through
a range of other factors that regulate proliferation and
survival independent of mTOR [19, 20]. We therefore
hypothesized that dual inhibition of PI-3K and mTOR
would provide a superior outcome in ALL as compared
to inhibition of mTOR alone. Since such inhibitors
are entering clinical trial for a range of advanced solid
malignancies, including endometrial and breast cancer,
if effective, rapid translation of these agents into clinical
practice could be anticipated. While a recent study
demonstrated superior in vitro activity of the dual PI-3K/
mTOR inhibitors over mTOR inhibition alone in ALL in
vitro [21], we extended these findings to the in vivo setting
using a human ALL xenograft model in NOD/SCID mice.
While we confirmed this increased in vitro activity of

dual inhibitors, this did not fully translate into improved
survival times in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with human
ALL.

RESULTS
The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors show greater
anti-proliferative effects than mTOR inhibitors
in pre-B-ALL cell lines in vitro
We have previously reported that the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus reduces ALL cell proliferation
and induces cell death [10, 11]. Considering that PI3K is upstream of mTOR, and is activated by many
microenvironmental cues important for ALL proliferation
and survival [8, 22], we considered that inhibition of PI3K in addition to mTOR would be a superior strategy to
inhibition of mTOR alone. We compared the effects of
the dual PI-3K/mTOR inhibitors BEZ235 and BGT226

with that of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. BEZ235 and
BGT226 inhibited the proliferation of three ALL cell lines
(NALM6, REH and LK63) with a similar IC50 of between
13 and 26 nM, 2 logs lower that of everolimus (1.5 - 10
µM) (Figure 1A). Using stromal-dependent patient derived
cell lines we found BGT226 had similar IC50 values of
between 13 and 30 nM but BEZ235 was slightly less
effective in this setting with IC50s of 33, 40 and 80 nM for
2070, 1786 and 2032 cell lines respectively. Despite this
the dual PI-3K/mTOR inhibitors were still dramatically
more effective than everolimus (IC50 1.5-6 µM) (Figure
1B). Dual PI-3K/mTOR inhibitors are clearly more potent
at inhibiting ALL cell proliferation than mTOR inhibitors.

which was not affected by time (Table 1).
While BEZ235 induced caspase-3 activation at
concentrations associated with the induction of cell
death, caspase-3 cleavage was less pronounced following
exposure to cytotoxic concentrations of BGT226 (Figure
2A). Consistent with these findings BEZ235-mediated
cell death was significantly inhibited by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD, although the effect was more
pronounced in REH than in NALM6 cells. Z-VAD had a
similar effect on the viability of BGT226 treated NALM6
cells but was completely ineffective in REH cells where
little caspase-3 cleavage had been observed (Figure 2B).
This suggests that the death mechanism differs between
the 2 agents and that apoptosis is less prominent with the
more potent inhibitor. Both inhibitors induced autophagy
as evidenced by the development of acid vacuoles (Figure
3A and B), increased LC3 processing (Figure 3C) and
the detection of autophagosomes by electron microscopy
(Figure 3D), however pre-treatment with 3MA did not
significantly affect cell death (Figure 3E) although
autophagy was attenuated (Figure 3F).

The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors show variable
cytotoxic potency and death mechanisms in preB-ALL cell lines in vitro
The effect of dual kinase inhibitors on ALL cell
viability was assessed using annexin V/propidium iodide
(PI) staining by flow cytometry and representative dot
plots are shown in Figure 1E. In contrast to effects on
proliferation, the dual PI-3K/mTOR inhibitors had a more
varied effect on cell viability. Over a 24-hour period,
BGT226 induced ALL cell death at low micromolar
concentrations (IC50s of 0.6-1.3 µM) in ALL cell lines
(Figure 1C and D and Table 1). In contrast BEZ235 was
considerably less potent, requiring between 30 µM and
128 µM concentrations to induce cell death. Everolimus
had an intermediate efficacy with IC50s of 10 – 13 µM
(Figure 1C and D and Table 1) consistent with our
previous reports [11]. Extending the assay time revealed
increased efficacy of BEZ235 and BGT226 at later time
points (p<0.001 for both). IC50s for BGT226 fell by 15, 45
and 80% in REH, LK63 and NALM6 cells respectively,
and by almost a log for BEZ235 in LK63 and NALM6
over 3 days. This differed from the effect of everolimus,

BEZ235 and BGT226 show efficacy in a NOD/
SCID mouse model of pre-B-ALL but are not
always superior to everolimus
In order to examine the potential efficacy of dual
kinase inhibitors in vivo we used a NOD/SCID mouse
xenograft model of human ALL. Mice were engrafted
with ALL and treatment commenced when 1% ALL
was detected in the peripheral blood. Mice were
treated continuously until they succumbed to disease.
BGT226 and BEZ235 were used at 40 and 10 mg/kg/
daily respectively, the maximum tolerated dose in our
model (data not shown). Both BGT226 and BEZ235
increased the overall survival of mice from a median of
37.75 (range 34.5-52, n=6 xenografts with 6 animals/

group) days for control treated groups to 71.5 (range 52105, n=6, p=0.004) days for BEZ235 treated groups and
76.75 (range 67.5-140.5, n=6, p=0.006) days for BGT226
treated groups. As previously reported everolimus treated
groups also had an extended survival with a median
survival of 78.75 (range 59-97.5, n=6, p=0.003) days.
Using a pairwise comparison by performing a Log Rank
(Mantel-Cox) test across all 6 xenografts, it was revealed
that the dual kinase inhibitors and everolimus resulted
in significantly increased survival compared to control,
however, the dual kinase inhibitors were not superior
to everolimus alone (p=0.23 and 0.36 for BEZ235
and BGT226 respectively), nor were there any overall

difference between BEZ235 and BGT226 (p=0.108).
However when individual xenografts were
considered, significant differences between treatments
were apparent (Table 2). Each treatment significantly
extended survival regardless of the xenograft tested with
the exception of BEZ235 in xenograft 1809 (Figure 4).
BEZ235 and BGT226 were clearly superior to everolimus
in xenografts 0407 and 2032 (p=0.0483 and p=0.0005
respectively for 0407, and p=0.0152 and p=0.003
respectively for 2032). In contrast, everolimus was clearly
superior to both BEZ235 and BGT226 in xenograft 1345
(p=0.0012 and p=0.0008), to BGT226 in xenograft 0398
(p=0.0011) and to BEZ235 in xenograft 1809 (p=0.0005).

Everolimus also showed significantly improved survival
over BEZ235 in xenograft 1196 (p=0.0182). BGT226
tended to perform better than BEZ235, with animals
receiving BGT226 surviving longer than those receiving
BEZ235 in xenografts 1809 (p=0.0005), 0407 (p=0.0018)
and 1196 (p=0.0182), while BEZ235 treated mice survived
longer than mice treated with BGT226 in xenograft 0398
(p=0.0011).
Overall xenografts 2032 and 0407 had better
responses to the dual inhibitors than to everolimus, while
xenograft 1345 had a better response to everolimus than
the dual inhibitors. The remaining xenografts had more
mixed responses with everolimus performing similarly
to one of the dual inhibitors but better than the other. In
two of these 3 xenografts BGT226 outperformed BEZ235.
To determine whether these differential responses were
reflected by differing in vitro sensitivities to the agents we
repeated the in vitro survival studies on the xenograft cells.
The order of sensitivity was the same as that observed in
the cell lines, with the exception of 1809, which was very
sensitive to everolimus in vitro, although this was not
reflected in the in vivo responses of this xenograft (Figure
4C, xenograft 2032 is shown in Figure 1).

Figure 5B) but mixed responses to BEZ235 were seen
(Figure S1). By 24 hours, neither agent had an overall
significant effect on the phosphorylation of S6RP with
only xenograft 2032 remaining significantly inhibited
by both agents. Overall, there was no clear association
between the extent of inhibition of mTOR signaling
and the response of the xenograft to treatment with the
dual inhibitors (Figure 4 and 5). Where phosphorylation
of AKT on Ser473 could be detected it was reduced by
BEZ235 and BGT226 at 2 hours and somewhat less so at
24 hours. In the case of Thr308 the effect was generally less
marked but highly variable between xenografts (Figure
5A).

BEZ235 and BGT226 effectively inhibit mTOR
signaling in vivo
In an attempt to explain the varied responses of
the individual xenografts to dual kinase inhibitors we
studied the effect of the various inhibitors on signaling
events downstream of PI-3K. We have previously reported
that everolimus robustly inhibits mTORC1 signaling in
our ALL model.[10] Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was
significantly inhibited by BEZ235 and BGT226 in vivo
2 hours after administration (p<0.01 for both agents)
but increased by 24 hours, remaining significantly lower
than controls for BGT226 only (p=0.02, Figure 5B).
Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (S6RP) was
consistently inhibited by BGT226 at 2 hours (p=0.01,

than total AKT then 0398 had comparable levels as the
remaining xenografts but xenograft 0407 remained
lower than the others (Figure S2B). Again there was no
correlation between phosphorylation of AKT on either
site and the survival of mice treated with any of the
compounds.
The effect of the inhibitors on the phosphorylation
of AKT on Ser473 and Thr308 was also examined in in
vitro cultures. As expected, everolimus did not inhibit
but increased phosphorylation on Ser437 in four of the six
xenografts (2032, 0407, 1809 and 1196) (densitometry
shown in Figure S3), presumably due to activation of
mTORC2 resulting from inhibition of S6K. Furthermore,
everolimus also increased phosphorylation of AKT
on Thr308 in xenografts 2032, 0407 and 1809, two of
which responded better to the dual inhibitors. Increased
phosphorylation of AKT was not observed when the dual

phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473 was associated with

not reach statistical significance (Figure 6A & B). If

although these mutations are not common in leukemias
[26]. Loss of expression and/or function of phosphatases,
most notably PTEN, that regulate this pathway have also
been reported, including T-ALL [27, 28]. We, and others,
have demonstrated that inhibition of signaling through
mTORC1 kills ALL cells [11, 29, 30]. The rapalogue
everolimus induced a caspase-independent cell death in
vitro and prolonged the survival of immune-compromised
mice engrafted with human ALL [10, 11]. Although
everolimus extended recipient mouse survival for each
xenograft tested, in some instances the effects were
relatively modest and in all but one xenograft the mice

ultimately died of ALL.
Signaling through PI-3K can promote cell survival
and proliferation through mTORC1 independent
mechanisms [14-18]. Furthermore, inhibition of mTORC1
can result in phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473 by
mTORC2 [31] or on Thr308 due to loss of the negative
feedback loop through S6K and further activation of
PI-3K [32]. Therefore, we considered that dual mTOR/
PI-3K inhibitors might provide a superior effect to
mTORC1 inhibition alone. In this study we compared
the efficacy of two dual specificity ATP-competitive PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, BEZ235 and BGT226 with the
rapalogue everolimus, which is a rapamycin analogue
that specifically inhibits mTORC1 [33]. In addition to
mTORC1, BEZ235 and BGT226 inhibit all isoforms
of PI-3K and mTORC2 [34, 35]. As a result of their
additional targets, BEZ235 and BGT226 can block
mTORC1 independent PI-3K functions and prevent the
two major feedback loops that potentially undermine
the efficacy of mTORC1 inhibition. Indeed BEZ235 and
BGT226 did not produce feedback activation of AKT and
as anticipated BEZ235 and BGT226 had a significantly

greater cytostatic effect on ALL cells than everolimus.
However, only BGT226 had greater cytotoxic effects, with
BEZ235 being less cytotoxic in vitro than everolimus. The
lower cytotoxicity of BEZ235 as compared to BGT226
identified here is consistent with findings in ALL cells
by Badura et al [21]. There was no evidence to suggest
that efficacy of any of the agents was dependent on the
underlying genetic drivers of the disease as the samples
tested had a range of genetic lesions (Table S1) but were
equally affected in vitro. We have previously shown that
everolimus kills cells in a caspase-independent manner
[11] but BEZ235 consistently induced caspase-dependent
apoptosis as reported by others [36]. The more potent
BGT226 had a mixed effect with apoptosis being induced
in some cell lines but was not detected in others.
Consistent with superior in vitro cytotoxic
effects, BGT226 outperformed BEZ235 in three of the
six xenografts tested. Surprisingly, neither BEZ235
nor BGT226 proved to be superior to everolimus in
extending the survival of xenografted animals when all
the xenografts were analyzed. However, it was clear that
some xenografts responded better to the dual PI-3K/

the dual kinase inhibitors did not necessarily result in in
vitro cell killing or extended survival times in leukemia
bearing mice. Levy et al demonstrated activity of the
selective AKT inhibitor GSK690693 in a proportion of
ALL cell lines [45], but the failure to affect all cell lines,
including those of the B lineage, suggest that AKT is not
essential for ALL cell proliferation and survival.
Overall our study shows superior activity of
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in suppressing in vitro
ALL cell proliferation than single mTORC1 inhibition
by everolimus. Perhaps surprisingly only BEZ235
consistently induced apoptosis, although this was only
achieved at very high concentrations. These effects
were consistent across all leukemic cell lines tested,
regardless of the underlying genetic changes. While the
dual kinases inhibitors significantly extended the survival
of ALL bearing mice these effects were variable between
xenografts and were not always superior to those achieved
with everolimus. The reason for the variable responses is
not clear but is not explained by higher basal or feedback
induced AKT activation.

mTOR inhibitors while others had superior responses to
everolimus. We considered that the xenografts that had
better responses to dual kinase inhibition might have had
higher basal AKT activation or stronger feedback AKT
phosphorylation in response to mTORC1 inhibition.
However, these factors did not provided a mechanism to
identify the xenografts would respond better to dual kinase
inhibition. Further exploration of the underlying biology
of the xenografts may provide answers. Genome-wide
sequencing and gene expression analysis may provide
insights into which pathways are driving the individual
leukemias, thereby providing insights into likely responses
to agents. In addition, the assessment of effect of drug
treatment on gene expression and the phosphoproteome
of samples may provide insights. However, it is possible
that multiple factors/features contribute to the response
making it difficult to prospectively identify patients that
will respond better to dual kinase inhibitors and those for
whom everolimus will produce a superior outcome.
The somewhat disappointing in vivo response to
dual kinase inhibitors such as BEZ235 has important
implications regarding to translation of these agents into
clinical practice. The current clinical trial of the rapalogue,
everolimus in combination with chemotherapy for adult
ALL (NCT00968253) is currently providing promising
results [37]. However, the hoped for improvement using
dual kinase inhibitors now appears less certain. The lack
of any sustained responses suggests that these inhibitors
will not be useful as single agents, even in minimal
residual disease setting, as resistance is likely to develop.
Nevertheless, the dual kinase inhibitors have yet to be
tested in combination with standard chemotherapy agents
in leukemias, and it is possible that such combinations
may provide superior results. The potential for synergistic
interactions with DNA damaging agents is suggested by
the ability of BEZ235 to inhibit the PI-3K related enzymes

[39] and ATR [40] that are important for responses to
DNA damage [41]. Indeed the recent study by Shortt et al
demonstrated that inhibition of these enzymes, along with
mTORC1, was responsible for the induction of apoptosis
in lymphoma cells [36]. In solid tumors BEZ235 enhanced
the effects of cisplatin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
[42] and a range of cytotoxic agents in hepatocellular
carcinoma [43]. Whether BGT226 also inhibits these
enzymes is current not known and may provide an
explanation for the differing cell death mechanisms
observed with the two agents, but BGT226 and BEZ235
similarly sensitized endothelial cells to ionizing radiation
[44].
Overall the strong responses to everolimus and
limited improvement in the presence of dual kinase
inhibition suggests that in B lineage ALL signaling
through mTORC1 may be the most important arm of the
PI-3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in mediating cell survival and
proliferation. Indeed the prevention of AKT activation by

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
Human precursor-B ALL cell lines were obtained
as follows: NALM-6 from Deutsche Sammlung Von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen Gmbh (DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany); Reh from American Type
Culture Collection ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA); and LK63 was a gift from Professor Andrew Boyd (Queensland
Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, QLD, Australia).
Cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS) (complete media) as previously
described [46]. Stromal dependent ALL cell lines were
developed in this laboratory by culturing patient samples
on stromal layers as previously described [47]. Patientderived xenografts have been previously reported [10, 48,
49]. A summary of the clinical information relating to the
in house cell lines and xenografts has been provided in
Table S1 for ease of reference.

Antibodies and Reagents
Everolimus, BGT226 AND BEZ235 were kindly
provided by Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). Vincristine
sulfate was purchased from Millennium Pharmaceuticals
(Cambridge, MA), Doxorubicin from Pfizer (Melrose
Park, NSW, Australia). Ionizing radiation was delivered
using an X-ray irradiator (XRAD320, Precision X-Ray,
Inc. East Haven, CT) at a dose rate of 0.91 Gy/minute. The
following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technologies (Danvers, MA, USA): rabbit anti-phospho10468

Oncotarget

4E-BP1, rabbit anti-4E-BP1, rabbit anti-phospho-S6RP,
mouse anti-S6RP, rabbit anti-phospho-AKT (Ser475),
rabbit anti-phospho-AKT (Thr308), rabbit anti-mouse AKT
and rabbit anti-LC3B. Rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 was
purchased from BD Pharmingen, (San Diego, CA, USA).

and total proteins were detected sequentially on the same
membrane using specific primary antibodies, appropriate
secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP and enhanced
chemiluminescence (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). Bands
were quantitated by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics)
using ImageQuant software.

Proliferation Assays

Mouse models

Proliferation assays were performed by
H-thymidine (Perkin Elmer, Glen Waverley VIC
Australia) incorporation as previously described [7].
Briefly, 3H-thymidine (37 000 Bq) was added after the
indicated period of culture and cells harvested onto glass
fiber filters (Perkin Elmer) after another 16 h of culture.
Radioactivity was measured using a Topcount NXT
scintillation counter after addition of 30 µL of Microscint
40 per well.

Cells were treated as described and labeled with
10 µM Lysosensor Blue DND-167 (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) as previously described [10]. Cells were
resuspended in fresh medium prior to examination using
an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope
system, based on an Olympus IX-81 ZDC microscope,
with BP 330-385 nm excitation and BA 420nm emission
filters. Images were captured using FV10-ASW 1.7
software and the number of acidic vacuoles in cells
quantitated using ImageJ software.

NOD/SCID mice were housed in sterile microisolator cages in ventilated racks. Protocols were approved
by the Westmead Animal Ethics Committee. Everolimus
was formulated at 2% (w/v) in a microemulsion vehicle,
BEZ235 at 80 mg/mL and BGT226 at 20 mg/mL
(Novartis Pharma AG). 100 µl of freshly thawed drugs
were administered by gavage. Everolimus (5 mg/kg) was
given thrice weekly, BEZ235 (40 mg/kg), BGT226 (10
mg/kg) and vehicle were administered daily. Six to 8
week old female NOD/SCID mice received 3 Gy of total
body irradiation from an X-ray source delivered by a self
contained cabinet (model X-RAY 320, Precision X-ray
Inc, CMS Alphatech Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia), equipped
with a Pantak Seifert ISOVOLT 320 HS x-ray tube, 24
h before administration of 3-5x106 human leukemic cells
via tail vein injection. Mice were bled weekly and the
percentage of human cells determined by flow cytometry
using antibodies to human CD19 and murine CD45.
In survival assays, treatment commenced once
≥1% leukemic cells were detected in the peripheral blood
(PB). Groups of 6 mice received vehicle only, BEZ235,
BGT226 or everolimus until sacrifice was required due to
deterioration of health scores. Mouse welfare was assessed
daily using standardized score sheets for signs of leukemia
including paralysis, loss of weight, ruffled coat, hunched
posture, altered respiration and inactivity.
In functional assays, treatment was delayed until
the mice had an expected survival time of less than
2 weeks. Mice were sacrificed 2 hours or 1 day after
starting treatment. PB and spleens were analyzed for the
presence of leukemic cells by flow cytometry. Spleen
cells were collected for flow cytometry and Western blot
analysis. Vertebral bodies and sternums were analyzed
for ultra-structural changes affecting leukemic cells by
light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Livers and femurs were collected for histological
examination.

Western blotting

Electron Microscopy

A single cell suspension was obtained from spleens
and red cells lysed with 0.155 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3
and 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5). Cell lysates were prepared
and equal amounts of protein loaded in each lane of 7.5 or
15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes as previously described [22]. Phosphorylated

Electron microscopy was performed as previously
described [10]. Briefly, cells were fixed in modified
Karnofsky fixative (2.5% formaldehyde prepared freshly
from paraformaldehyde, 2% EM grade glutaraldehyde in
0.1 M 3-[N-morpholino] propane sulphonic acid buffer,
pH 7.4) for 2 hours. Cell blocks were post-fixed in

3

Flow Cytometry
Intracellular staining was performed on cells fixed
in ice cold 70% ethanol and blocked in perm/wash buffer
(BD Biosciences, 554722) containing 10% human AB
serum for 1 h. Cells were labeled for 1 h with appropriate
primary antibodies, or isotype control antibody, at room
temperature in the dark. Cells were subsequently washed
and resuspended in 100 µL PBS for analysis by flow
cytometry. To assess viability cells were labeled with
annexin V (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA)
and propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
analyzed using a FACSCanto flow cytometer.

Statistical Analysis
Comparisons between 2 groups were performed
using Student’s t-tests and between multiple groups using
ANOVA analysis. Where appropriate log transformation
was made prior to analysis to stabilize to variance.
Pairwise comparisons between groups were adjusted
for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s method.
Survival was measured from the onset of disease until
death and analyzed using SPSS, Version 15.0. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival
curves, and results were compared using the log-rank
test of survival distribution by treatment stratified by
xenograft. The number of cells containing acidic vacuoles
was compared between groups using Student T tests and
comparison of the number of acidic vacuoles/cell analyzed
using the Kruskal-Wallis test, to determine differences
between treatments, and the Jonckheere-Terpstra test to
demonstrate association between increasing numbers of
acidic vacuoles/cell with drug treatment.
