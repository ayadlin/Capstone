Abstract
EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors, including geﬁtinib and erlotinib, exert potent therapeutic efﬁcacy in
non–small cell lung cancers harboring EGFR-activating mutations. However, most patients ultimately develop
resistance to these drugs. Here, we report a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors and the reversal of which could improve clinical outcomes. In erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells
harboring activating EGFR mutations that we established, there was increased expression of Src, integrin b1, a2,
and a5 along with enhanced cell adhesion activity. Interestingly, RNAi-mediated silencing of integrin b1 restored
erlotinib sensitivity and reduced activation of Src and Akt after erlotinib treatment. Furthermore, Src silencing
inhibited Akt phosphorylation and cell growth, with this inhibitory effect further augmented by erlotinib
treatment. Increased expression of integrin b1, a5, and/or a2 was also observed in refractory tumor samples
from patients with lung cancer treated with erlotinib and/or geﬁtinib. Together, our ﬁndings identify the integrin
b1/Src/Akt signaling pathway as a key mediator of acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted anticancer drugs. Cancer

Introduction
Patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring
activating somatic mutations in the EGF receptor (EGFR) gene
show dramatic clinical responses. Of the somatic mutations,
in-frame deletions in exon 19 (del E746-A750) and the L858Rpoint mutation are most commonly observed in NSCLC (1).
These EGFR mutations are closely associated with sensitivity
to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib and geﬁtinib. Both geﬁtinib and erlotinib have shown to improve
progression-free survival as compared with chemotherapy
alone when given as ﬁrst-line treatment for patients with
NSCLCs harboring activating EGFR mutations (2–6).
However, one of the serious problems encountered during
clinical treatment with EGFR-TKI is the appearance of drugresistant tumors (7). Well-characterized mechanisms for the

acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs include the T790M mutation
in exon 20 of the EGFR-TKI domain (8, 9) and Met ampliﬁcation (10). Furthermore, the loss of PTEN and increased expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ABCG2,
insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR), and TGF-b have
also been reported (7, 11, 12). In addition to these wellcharacterized mechanisms, further elucidation of novel
mechanisms for acquired drug resistance is essential for the
development of personalized therapeutics and strategies to
circumvent drug resistance.
In our laboratory, we have established various drug-resistant
cell lines from human lung cancer cell lines harboring activating EGFR mutations by selecting for resistance to EGFRTKIs (13). Previously, we have reported the loss of PTEN
expression with the loss of nuclear translocation of EGR-1, a
transcription factor responsible for PTEN gene expression, in
geﬁtinib-resistant clones (14–16). We also reported that either
the complete or partial loss of the activated EGFR gene allele
could also result in the acquisition of erlotinib resistance (17).
In this present study, we further established erlotinib-resistant
clones by step-wise selection following exposure to erlotinib
and observed enhanced expression and activation of integrin
b1 and Src. Herein, we present a novel bypass mechanism
through which the integrin b1/Src/Akt signaling may play a
pivotal role in the acquisition of erlotinib resistance in lung
cancer cells.

Kinki University (Osaka, Japan). These cells and the resistant
clones were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10%
FBS in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 (14, 18). Cells were routinely
conﬁrmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination using
mycosensor QPCR Assay Kits (Agilent Technologies). Cells
were transiently transfected with cDNA using Lipofectamine
LTX, PLUS reagent, and Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Cells were
transfected with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturers' recommendations. Reagents are described in
Supplementary Material and Methods.
Cytotoxicity assays
Exponentially growing cell suspensions were seeded into
each well and the following day the indicated concentration of
drugs was added. After incubation for 72 hours, cytotoxicity
was determined as described previously (17, 18). Each value
represents the average from triplicate wells  SD.
For colony formation assay, 5  102 cells were plated in 35
mm dishes and following day, cells were transfected with
integrin b1 siRNA. After 48 hours, various concentrations of
erlotinib were added, followed by incubation for 7 days at 37 C.
Colonies of more than 10 cells were counted after Giemsa
staining as described previously (19). Each value represents
the average of duplicate dishes.
Western blot analysis
Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Triton X-100
buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L NaF,
1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol containing 5 mmol/L EDTA,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 10 mg/mL aprotinin,
10 mg/mL leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate)
and cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.). For detection of
active integrin b1, cells were plated on ﬁbronectin- or collagencoated dishes and incubated with antiactive integrin b1 antibody (HUTS-4) for 30 minutes at 37 C. Cells were then rinsed
with PBS, lysed in SDS sample buffer, and bound antibody was
detected by Western blotting (20). Immunoprecipitation was
described in Supplementary Material and Methods.
Cell adhesion assay
For cell adhesion assay, 96-well plates were coated with
collagen (10 mg/well, Trevigen) or ﬁbronectin (5 mg/well,
Trevigen) and cancer cells were seeded onto the extracellular
matrix components, allowed to adhere for 30 minutes at 37 C.
Each value represents the average from triplicate trials  SD.
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was reverse transcribed from random hexamers using
avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). In
brief, 20 mL of PCR ampliﬁcation reaction mixtures contained
cDNA, primer pairs (Applied Biosystems), a dual-labeled
ﬂuorogenic probe (Applied Biosystems), and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycle
conditions included maintaining the reactions at 50 C for 2
minutes and 95 C for 10 minutes and then 40 cycles alter-

The relative gene expression for each sample was determined

using the formula 2ðDCt Þ ¼ 2½Ct ðGAPDHÞ  Ct target ,
which reﬂected the target gene expression normalized to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels.
Each value represents the average from triplicate trials  SD.
Flow cytometry (FACS)
Cell suspension (106 cells/100 mL) in incubation buffer [0.5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS] was stained with antiintegrin b1 mAb or puriﬁed PE-Mouse IgG2a Control (BectonDickinson) for 1 hour at 4 C. Flow cytometry was conducted
using the FACSCalibur System (Becton-Dickinson).
Tumor samples
Informed consent for the use of tumor tissue specimens was
obtained from patients according to the legal guidance (21, 22).
Tumor samples, case 4 and case 10, are collected from University Hospital, University of Occupational and Environmental Health (Kitakyushu, Japan). Tumor samples, case RB4 and
case RB11, are from EURTAC Study in Spain. The EURTAC was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating center and written informed consent was obtained
from all patients. Mutation status of EGFR (delE746-A750
and L858R) and T790M was examined by direct sequencing
analysis. K-Ras mutations were investigated by PCR analysis
(21–23).
Immunohistochemical analysis
Expression of integrins and Src was examined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining as previously described (23). Antiintegrin b1 mAb was purchased from Abcam Inc., anti-integrin
a2 mAb was from Epitomics, anti-integrin a5 mAb was from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-Src was from Cell Signaling
Technology. The intensity of staining was scored using the
following scale: no staining, 0; weak staining, þ1; moderate
staining, þ2; and strong staining, þ3, in more than 10% of
cancer cells.

Results
Establishment of the erlotinib-resistant subclones from
PC9 cells and 11-18 cells
To isolate erlotinib-resistant subclones from PC9 cells harboring the activating EGFR delE746-A750 mutation and 11-18
cells harboring activating EGFR L858R mutation, we cultured
PC9 cells and 11-18 cells in increasing, step-wise doses of
erlotinib up to 15 mmol/L for approximately 6 months as
described previously (14, 17). We isolated drug-resistant cell
lines, PC9/ER2 and 11-18/ER2, and further established drugresistant subclones, PC9/ER2-2 and PC9/ER2-3 from PC9/ER2
and 11-18/ER2-1 from 11-18/ER2 (Fig. 1A; Table 1). Growth
rates between each parental cell line and resistant subclones
are similar (Table 1). Resistant subclones also manifested
increased resistance to geﬁtinib as compared with the
parental cell lines (Table 1). In contrast, these 3 resistant
subclones exhibited similar sensitivities to picropodophyllin
(an inhibitor of IGF-IR), SU11274 (an inhibitor of Met), and
cisplatin as compared with the parental cell lines (Table 1).

Neither alteration for secondary EGFR mutations (T790M,
T854A, L747S, and D761Y) nor hot spot activating mutation
of PIK3CA was detected in resistant subclones (data not
shown).
As compared with parental cell lines, all resistant subclones
expressed relatively lower levels of phospho-HER2 (pHER2; Fig.
1B). In addition, 2 resistant subclones from PC9 expressed
lower levels of HER2, HER3, and pHER3. In contrast, the
expression of phospho-Akt (pAkt) was moderately higher in
the resistant subclones, although that of PTEN, c-Met, IGF1R,
Axl, and FGFR1-4 was also similar among cell lines (Fig. 1B,
data not shown). DelE746-A750 EGFR was similarly expressed
among both of the resistant subclones and the PC9 cell line
(data not shown). However, L858R EGFR expression was less in
11-18/ER2-1 cells because of the partial loss of mutated EGFR
gene allele, as described previously (17). The phosphorylation
of EGFR (pEGFR) and Erk1/2 was similarly inhibited by erlotinib in a dose-dependent manner in parental cell lines as well
as the resistant subclones. In contrast, the phosphorylation of
Akt was observed even in the presence of erlotinib in the
resistant subclones (Fig. 1C).
Increased expression of b1, a2, and a5 integrins in the
erlotinib-resistant subclones
We further examined the expression levels of integrins in
the resistant subclones by Western blot analysis. Surprisingly, all resistant subclones manifested higher levels of b1,
a2, and a5 integrins than the parental cell lines. However,
there were similar expression levels of av and b4 integrins
between parental cell lines and the resistant subclones (Fig.
2A). PC9/ER2-2 and PC9/ER2-3 also exhibited higher expression levels of integrin b1 mRNA than the PC9 cells, but 1118/ER2-1 exhibited similar expression levels of integrin b1
mRNA (Fig. 2B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis also revealed higher expression levels of membranous integrin b1 in PC9/ER2-2 and 11-18/ER2-1 as compared
with parental cell lines (Fig. 2C). Integrin b1 is known to be
dimerized with a integrin family proteins a2 and a5 (24),
and immunoprecipitation Western blot analysis revealed
that a2 or a5 integrins were coimmunoprecipitated with
integrin b1 in PC9/ER2-2 and PC9/ER2-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A).

Integrins induce the activation of downstream regulatory
signaling pathways by adopting a high-afﬁnity state to interact
with extracellular matrices (25). Ligands of integrin a2b1 and
integrin a5b1 are collagen and ﬁbronectin, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 2D, increased activation of integrin b1 in PC9/
ER2-2 and 11–18/ER2-1 cells as compared with parental cell
lines was observed in the presence of ﬁbronectin or collagen
when a speciﬁc antibody (HUTS-4) recognizing ligand-occupied integrin b1 was used. Furthermore, the adhesion of cells to
collagen- or ﬁbronectin-coated plates in the resistant subclones was signiﬁcantly higher than that observed in parental
cell lines (Fig. 2E).
Integrin b1 knockdown overcomes erlotinib resistance
in resistant subclones
We next examined whether integrin b1 expression was
correlated with erlotinib resistance or constitutive Akt phosphorylation. Treatment with integrin b1 siRNA almost
completely suppressed the expression of integrin b1 protein
and mRNA (Fig. 3A and B) and there were no apparent changes
in the growth rates between each parental cell line and their
resistant subclones upon exposure to integrin b1 siRNA for 5
days (data not shown). In resistant subclones, integrin b1
siRNA-treatment restored sensitivity to erlotinib (Fig. 3C) and
erlotinib treatment almost completely blocked the constitutive
phosphorylation of Akt when integrin b1 was silenced (Fig. 3D).
We further examined whether integrins a2 and a5 were also
involved in the constitutive Akt phosphorylation in PC9/ER2-2
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The phosphorylation of Akt was
moderately inhibited by erlotinib when integrin a2 or integrin
a5 was silenced in PC9/ER2-2 cells. Integrin b1 knockdown
was also accompanied by the downregulation of integrin a5,
suggesting a close regulatory link between integrin b1 and
integrin a5. These results suggest that integrin b1, in concert
with integrin a2 and/or integrin a5, seems to play a key role in
the acquisition of erlotinib resistance.
We further established the stable cell lines PC9/ITG2 and
PC9/ITG11 by transfecting PC9 cells with integrin b1 cDNA
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). There was no concomitant enhancement of the expression of integrin a2 or integrin a5 in either
cell line and no apparent changes in the growth rates of PC9/
Mock, PC9/ITG2, and PC9/ITG11 cells over the 5-day culture

period (data not shown). These 2 stable cell lines exhibited
slightly increased resistance to erlotinib (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Akt was not suppressed by erlotinib in either the PC9/ITG2 or PC9/ITG11 cell
lines while Akt phosphorylation was suppressed in PC9/Mock
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). The pEGFR and Erk1/2 was
similarly suppressed by erlotinib in the PC9/Mock cells and the
corresponding integrin b1-overexpressing cell lines. Thus, the
overexpression of integrin b1 with integrin a2 and integrin a5
seems to be one of the mechanisms underlying acquired
erlotinib resistance.
Src knockdown and dasatinib treatment suppress Akt
phosphorylation and cell survival in the resistant
subclones
Src protein, which interacts with PI3K, is often activated by
EGFR or integrin b1 in association with extracellular matrices
(26). Thus, we next examined whether integrin b1 could directly
induce the activation of the Src/Akt pathway and whether this

pathway could be responsible for erlotinib resistance. Relatively
higher expression levels of Src and pSrc (Y416) were observed in
PC9/ER2-2 and 11-18/ER2-1 cells as compared with each parental cell line (Fig. 4A). In each resistant subclone from PC9 or 1118 cells, the phosphorylation of Src was blocked by integrin b1
knockdown and this reduction was augmented by erlotinib
(Fig. 4B), suggesting a close correlation between integrin b1
and EGFR with the activation of the Src/Akt pathway.
We next examined how Src activation could be involved in
the integrin b1-driven activation of Akt and acquired erlotinib
resistance using Src siRNA and dasatinib—a Src kinase inhibitor. Treatment with Src siRNA almost completely suppressed
the expression of Src (Fig. 4C). Src siRNA treatment suppressed
expression of Src and markedly suppressed Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4D) and cell growth (Fig. 4E) in PC9/ER2-2 and 11-18/
ER2-1 cells. This suppression of Akt phosphorylation was
augmented by erlotinib. We further examined whether Akt
phosphorylation was inhibited by erlotinib in PC9/ER2-2 cells
treated with an inhibitor of Src, dasatinib. Dasatinib treatment

Figure 6. Our hypothetical model shows how erlotinib resistance is acquired in lung cancer cells. In erlotinib-sensitive cell lines, the proliferation and survival of
human lung cancer cells harboring activating EGFR mutation depend upon the EGFR-driven PI3K/Akt pathway and this cell proliferation and survival is
highly susceptible to erlotinib and other EGFR-TKIs. Erlotinib-resistant subclones express elevated levels of b1 and a2/a5 integrins together with Src, resulting
in Akt activation. In erlotinib-resistant cell lines, activated integrin b1, a2 or a5, and Src bypass pathway contributes to Akt signaling pathway.

T790M secondary mutation of EGFR, shows higher expression of integrin b1, a2, and Src in post-geﬁtinib treatment. In
this case, integrin overexpression might not be directly
correlated with acquired resistance (Fig. 5D). Expression of
integrins and Src in 4 clinical samples was summarized in
Supplementary Table S1.

Discussion
In our present study, we established erlotinib-resistant subclones from PC9 cells harboring the activating del E746-A750
EGFR mutation and 11-18 cells harboring the activating L858R
EGFR mutation. We observed the following characteristics in
these resistant subclones: (i) Akt was constitutively activated
and the phosphorylation of Akt was not suppressed by erlotinib
in resistant subclones; (ii) the expression of b1, a2, and a5
integrins was upregulated along with Src activation; (iii) the
knockdown of integrin b1 restored cellular sensitivity to erlotinib and reduced Akt phosphorylation; (iv) Src knockdown or
dasatinib treatment effectively inhibited cell survival and
reduced Akt phosphorylation in the presence or absence of
erlotinib; and (v) enhanced expression of integrin b1, a2, and/
or a5 was also observed in refractory tumor samples from
patients with lung cancer treated with geﬁtinib and/or erlotinib. Together, these novel ﬁndings indicate that the acquisition
of erlotinib resistance is mediated by the activation of the
integrin b1/Src/Akt signaling pathway (Fig. 6).
Three major mechanisms including the alteration of oncogenic targets, the activation of downstream regulatory molecules, and the activation of bypass effectors, are known to
contribute to acquired resistance to molecularly targeted
drugs in cancer cells (7). This study suggests that the acquisition of erlotinib resistance is attributable to the activation of
an integrin b1-driven bypass signaling pathway. Furthermore,
the study by Ju and colleagues (27) previously reported that
transfection with integrin b1 cDNA protected PC9 cells from
apoptosis in response to geﬁtinib treatment. However, this
study did not evaluate how integrin b1 overexpression renders

www.aacrjournals.org

lung cancer cells resistant to EGFR-TKIs. Our study showed
that transfection with integrin b1 slightly induced erlotinib
resistance in PC9 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) and in these
integrin b1-overexpressing cell lines, there was no enhanced
expression of integrin a2 or a5, suggesting that the coactivation of b1/a2 and/or b1/a5 integrins is required for the
acquisition of increased erlotinib resistance via the integrin
b1 signaling pathway.
The interactions between cancer cells and the extracellular
matrices often reduce the sensitivity to anticancer agents,
including geﬁtinib (28–31) and the expression of integrin
family proteins plays an important role in the malignant
progression of cancers (32–34). The cell proliferation rates
were similar between parental cell lines and the resistant
subclones, but the adhesion to collagen or ﬁbronectin was
much higher in the resistant subclones. Integrin b1 thus seems
to be responsible for not only the acquisition of erlotinib
resistance but also for cell adhesion activity.
In this study, we observed constitutive phosphorylation of
Akt even in the presence of erlotinib in resistant subclones.
This phosphorylation was markedly suppressed by erlotinib
upon integrin b1 knockdown and cell sensitivity to erlotinib
was restored by integrin b1 knockdown. These data strongly
suggest an essential role for integrin b1/a2 and/or integrin b1/
a5 in the constitutive activation of Akt and in the drug
resistance in the resistant subclones. Our study also sought
to understand how integrin b1 promotes Akt phosphorylation
and the acquisition of drug resistance. Of the potentially
relevant molecules, Src is known to be a downstream regulator
of EGFR and/or integrins and it plays an essential role in the
survival of lung cancer cells (35, 36). Src is also responsible for
the acquisition of resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs (37, 38).
Consistent with these studies, we observed marked activation
of Src in PC9/ER2-2 and 11-18/ER2-1 cells as compared with
the parental counterparts. The blockade of Src signaling by Src
siRNA resulted in the marked suppression of Akt phosphorylation, suggesting a close link between Src and Akt activation,

as shown in a previous study (26). Furthermore, Src knockdown also dramatically suppressed cell growth in PC9/ER2-2
and 11-18/ER2-1 cells, even in the absence of erlotinib. Furthemore, treatment with Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib also suppressed Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, these data
suggest that the activation of the integrin b1/Src/Akt signaling pathway may undergo compensatory activation during the acquisition of drug resistance (Fig. 6). On the other
hand, clinical trials of Src inhibitor dasatinib in combination
with erlotinib, was studied in lung cancer (39). We suggest
that Src is one of the effective targets for lung cancer
therapeutics.
We also examined whether integrin b1, together with integrin a2 or integrin a5, was expressed in lung cancer refractory
to geﬁtinib and/or erlotinib. These results showed increased
expression of b1, a2, and/or a5 integrins in 4 refractory tumors
following treatment with geﬁtinib and/or erlotinib (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Fig. S1). Enhanced expression of integrin b1
and a2 were also observed in case RB4-harbored T790M
secondary EGFR mutation (Fig. 5D). It remains to be further
studied whether the enhanced expression of integrin b1, a2,
and Src is closely correlated with T790M mutation. Recently,
integrin family targeted drugs are focused on cancer therapeutics. For example, anti-integrin a5b1 antibody (volociximab) is conducted on phase II clinical trials for several cancers
including NSCLC (40, 41). Further study should be also
required whether these integrin-targeted drugs could be useful
to overcome drug resistance in patients with NSCLC.
In conclusion, the acquisition of erlotinib resistance in our
erlotinib-resistant subclones was attributable to the overex-

pression of integrin b1/a2/a5, which resulted in the activation
of an integrin/Src/Akt pathway. This relationship between
integrin expression and Src activity may be useful for the
development of both personalized therapeutics involving
EGFR-TKIs and for circumventing drug resistance in patients
with NSCLC.
