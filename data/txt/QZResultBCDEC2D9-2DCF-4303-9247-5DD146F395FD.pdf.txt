ABSTRACT:
BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) proteins regulate gene expression
through their ability to bind to acetylated chromatin and subsequently activate RNA
PolII-driven transcriptional elongation. Small molecule BET inhibitors prevent binding
of BET proteins to acetylated histones and inhibit transcriptional activation of BET
target genes. BET inhibitors attenuate cell growth and survival in several hematologic
cancer models, partially through the down-regulation of the critical oncogene, MYC.
We hypothesized that BET inhibitors will regulate MYC expression in solid tumors that
frequently over-express MYC. Here we describe the effects of the highly specific BET
inhibitor, I-BET762, on MYC expression in prostate cancer models. I-BET762 potently
reduced MYC expression in prostate cancer cell lines and a patient-derived tumor
model with subsequent inhibition of cell growth and reduction of tumor burden in vivo.
Our data suggests that I-BET762 effects are partially driven by MYC down-regulation
and underlines the critical importance of additional mechanisms of I-BET762 induced
phenotypes.

INTRODUCTION

histones [5,6]. BET inhibitors are efficacious in models of
NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), a rare epithelial tumor
type driven by the fusions of NUT protein with either
BRD3 or BRD4 genes [7]. Additionally, BET inhibitors
have shown therapeutic potential in preclinical models of
multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia through
multiple mechanisms including down-regulation of MYC
expression [8-13].
Amplification of the MYC locus is frequent in
prostate cancer (30%) and is associated with disease
progression and Gleason score [14]. c-Myc protein levels
are also elevated in prostate tumors compared to normal
prostate epithelium [15], with a stepwise increase from
low-grade to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PIN). MYC overexpression is sufficient to transform
benign human prostate epithelium in vitro [16] and
MYC transgenic mice develop PIN [17], suggesting that
MYC plays a role in prostate cancer initiation. MYC is
a promising target in prostate cancer as demonstrated in

Cancer epigenetics is a rapidly progressing field
of oncology that has recently demonstrated the use of
epigenetic drugs as targeted treatments in preclinical
models of several cancer types, such as EZH2 inhibitors
in B-cell lymphomas and rhabdoid tumors and DOT1L
inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia [1-3]. Recent studies
demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors of BET
proteins attenuate cellular proliferation and survival in
several preclinical tumor models, including hematological
and solid cancers. The BET protein family includes
four members: BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT. These
proteins function as readers of acetylated chromatin that
translate chromatin status into activated transcription
through RNA PolII regulation. BET proteins play a role in
the cellular proliferation through cell cycle and apoptosis
regulation [4]. GSK525762A (I-BET762) is a specific
and potent inhibitor of BET protein binding to acetylated

the preclinical models of prostate cancer with antisense
nucleotides [18].
We have sought to explore MYC regulation in
prostate carcinoma models in the response to I-BET762
treatment. We observed that I-BET762 treatment inhibits
MYC expression accompanied by the growth inhibition
and decreased survival in prostate cancer cells that overexpress MYC. Importantly, BET inhibition reduces tumor
burden in a primary model of castration resistant prostate
cancer that expresses high levels of MYC. Our data suggest
that BET inhibitors offer new therapeutic approach to treat
prostate tumors driven by MYC.

some level of growth inhibition was observed in all cell
lines, a subset of the cell line panel was particularly
sensitive to I-BET762, with growth IC50 (gIC50) values
ranging from 25 nM to 150 nM (Figure 1A). Cell
cycle analysis in a subset of cell lines revealed a range
of responses to I-BET762 treatment. Concentrationdependent G1 arrest was observed in the LNCaP cell
line, whereas sub-G1 accumulation was detected in
VCaP cells (Figure 1B, C; Supplemental Table S1). PC3
cells exhibited minimal growth inhibition in response to
I-BET762; however cell cycle analysis revealed a slight
increase in the sub-G1 fraction suggesting low-level cell
death in response to compound treatment.
PARP cleavage confirmed induction of apoptosis in
VCaP cells (Figure 1E). In contrast, we detected minimal
cleaved PARP in cell lines that were either less sensitive
to I-BET762 (PC3), or exhibited G1 arrest in response
to the compound (LNCaP). Our data therefore suggest
that growth inhibition and apoptosis are independently
triggered in a subset of prostate cancer cell lines in
response to BET inhibitor treatment.

contributions of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 to the growth
inhibitory effects observed upon treatment with I-BET762,
we transfected LNCaP cells with siRNAs specific for the
individual BET proteins and measured effects on cell
growth after 6 days (Supplemental Figure S1). While the
most consistent and pronounced effects were observed
following BRD4 knockdown, loss of BRD2 and BRD3
also inhibited LNCaP cell growth, suggesting that all
three BET family proteins contribute to the potent growth
responses to BET inhibitors observed in prostate cancer
cell lines.

to I-BET762 (Supplemental Figure S2), c-Myc protein
expression appeared to qualitatively track with sensitivity,
with the highest levels of c-Myc protein occurring in the
cell lines with the lowest gIC50. Despite the high level of
c-Myc expression we did not detect copy number gains
at the MYC locus in any cell lines (Figure 2C). Similarly,
we observe no significant correlation between RNA
expression of AR or BET family genes and sensitivity
(Supplemental Figure S2); however, protein expression,
particularly for AR and BRD3, appear to be higher in cell
lines exhibiting greater sensitivity to I-BET762 (Figure
2B).

To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms
through which BET inhibitors regulate cell growth and
death in prostate cancer cell lines, we analyzed basal
expression of BET proteins and several oncogenes that
are known drivers in prostate cancer, including ERG,
MYC, and AR (Figure 2). ERG and TMPRSS2-ERG
RNA expression was observed in the VCaP and H660
cell lines (Figure 2A), which possess a translocation
resulting in a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcript [19,20].
High c-Myc expression was observed in several cell lines
(Figure 2A, B). While we did not observe a significant
correlation between MYC RNA expression and sensitivity

To gain a better understanding of the pathways
regulated by I-BET762 treatment in prostate cancer,
we profiled gene expression changes in four cell lines
(LNCaP, VCaP, NCI-H660, and PC3) following 24 hours
of treatment with I-BET762 via Affymetrix microarrays.
Significant down-regulation of genes associated with
cell cycle and DNA replication were observed in LNCaP
and VCaP (Table 1, Supplemental Table S2), which is
consistent with the potent growth inhibition observed in

these cell lines. Despite high level expression in VCaP
and LNCaP, we observe no change in AR expression
upon I-BET762 treatment in any of the cell lines profiled
(Supplemental Table S3). Consistent with sustained
expression of AR, we observe minimal effects on
androgen-dependent gene expression or growth in LNCaP
cells treated with I-BET762 (Supplemental Figure S3),

suggesting that the potent growth inhibition observed
in LNCaP cells with I-BET762 is due to perturbation of
other pathways. Similarly, despite high level expression of

MYC Silencing Contributes to I-BET762
Sensitivity in a Subset of Prostate Cancer Cell
Lines

Among the genes down-regulated in our data set
was MYC, which was previously shown to be silenced by
BET inhibitors in a number of tumor types [8-11]. GSEA
analysis identified MYC signatures among the top 10 most
significantly down-regulated signatures in the LNCaP
cell line following treatment with 0.5 µM I-BET762
(Figure 3A). Additional analysis revealed significant
down-regulation of MYC signatures in 3 out of the 4
cell lines profiled (Supplemental Figure S5), as well as
concentration-dependent suppression of c-Myc expression
in these same cell lines (Figure 3B). Suppression of c-Myc
and its downstream targets was most pronounced in cells
lines exhibiting the greatest sensitivity to I-BET762,
suggesting that perturbations in MYC pathways may
contribute to the growth effects observed in prostate
cancer cell lines.

We next examined the consequences of MYC downregulation in the LNCaP cell line using siRNA to knock
down MYC expression. c-Myc protein expression in the
siRNA treated sample was reduced to a similar degree as
treatment with 1µM I-BET762 (Figure 3C), and siRNA
or compound treatment resulted in similar effects on cell
growth (Figure 3D). Targeted inhibition of any single BET
protein via siRNA treatment produced minimal effects on
c-Myc expression (Supplemental Figure S1), suggesting
multiple BET proteins contribute to the silencing of c-Myc
expression observed upon treatment with I-BET762.
To further examine the contribution of MYC
silencing to the effects observed upon I-BET762 treatment,
we ectopically overexpressed GFP or MYC in LNCaP
and VCaP cells using lentiviral expression constructs.

Overall levels of c-Myc expression were relatively similar
between GFP and MYC overexpressing cells; however,
exogenous c-Myc expression was not down-regulated
by I-BET762 treatment in either cell line (Figure 4A).
Analysis of growth effects in GFP of MYC overexpressing
LNCaP cells following I-BET762 treatment revealed a
statistically significant 15-fold shift in gIC50 when MYC

expression could not be silenced (Figure 4B). Consistent
with the shift in gIC50, we observed a reduction in G1
arrest in the MYC overexpressing cells as determined by
cell cycle analysis (Figure 4C). In contrast, ectopic MYC
expression in VCaP cells produced minimal effects on
growth inhibition (Figure 4B, C) or induction of apoptosis
in response to the drug treatment (Supplemental Figure

response to I-BET762 is due, at least in part, to silencing
of c-Myc and its downstream pathways in a subset of
prostate cancer cell lines.

and decreases the tumor burden in androgen-refractory
primary patient-derived prostate carcinoma (Figure 5),
suggesting that I-BET762 might be a treatment option in
advanced prostate cancer.
Prostate carcinogenesis is a stepwise process that
starts with the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)
and progresses to the invasive carcinoma and androgen
refractory disease. MYC activation is thought to be an
early event in prostate cancer [23]. However, targeting
MYC expression still represents an intervention option
in prostate cancer, as demonstrated by the antisensenucleotide approach in models of prostate cancer, where
targeting MYC results in the suppression of proliferation
and the reduction of prostasphere formation [24].
Our observation that a BET inhibitor silences
c-Myc expression and downstream pathways in prostate
cancer cell lines is consistent with a previous report [25].
We further show that prostate cancer cell lines with high
c-Myc protein expression are more sensitive to I-BET762
(LNCaP and VCaP, Figure 1A) compared to cell lines with
low c-Myc protein expression (NCI-H660 and DU145,
Figure 1A). In the LNCaP cell line, MYC overexpression
partially rescued the I-BET762 induced anti-growth
phenotype (Figure 4), suggesting that MYC significantly
contributes to the response to I-BET762. Previously, it
has been reported that regulation of MYC expression
by BET inhibitors in solid tumors is somewhat cancertype dependent. In glioblastomas (GBM), BET inhibitor
treatment decreases MYC expression only in a subset of
patient-derived models and exogenous MYC expression
partially rescues BET driven anti-proliferative effects [26].
These results are consistent with observations that MYC
is critical for self-renewal and differentiation in GBM
[27]. Similarly, in neuroblastoma models BET inhibitors
down-regulate MYCN expression and the regulation of
cellular growth by BET is partially MYCN-dependent
[28,29]. In contrast to these studies, in lung carcinomas,
BET inhibition rarely down-regulates MYC and the
effect of BET inhibitors on proliferation of lung cancer
cells is MYC-independent [30]. Further understanding of
molecular mechanisms that determine the role of BET
proteins in MYC regulation will help to guide the selection
of MYC-driven tumor types that might benefit from BET
inhibition therapy.
MYC overexpression only partially rescued
I-BET762 phenotype in LNCaP cells and had minimal
effects in VCaP cells, underscoring that additional
mechanisms contribute to I-BET762 induced antiproliferative effects. In cell lines with potent inhibition
of cellular growth (LNCaP and VCaP) we observed
attenuation of cell cycle pathways, including the downregulation of MCM genes and genes important for G1/S
transition (Table 1, Supplemental Table S2). BRD4 is a
known regulator of G1/S transition in mouse fibroblasts,
where it activates transcription of Cyclin D, MCM2,
ORC2 and other genes that are involved in the cell cycle

I-BET762 Inhibits Growth of Primary Prostate
Cancer Xenografts
We next sought to determine if I-BET762 inhibits
prostate tumor growth in vivo. We characterized AR, MYC,
and TMRPSS2-ERG expression in two established primary
prostate cancer xenograft models: the castration-resistant
LuCaP 35CR model (formerly named LuCaP 35V; [21])
and the neuroendocrine prostate cancer model LuCaP
145.2. While the levels of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4
are comparable between the two models, LuCaP 35CR
expresses high levels of AR, MYC, and TMPRSS2-ERG,
whereas expression of these genes are low or undetectable
in LuCaP 145.2 (Figure 5A, B). Repeated dosing of mice
bearing LuCaP 35CR xenografts with I-BET762 resulted
in significant down-regulation of MYC as well as MLKL
(Figure 5C), a gene that was down-regulated in several cell
lines upon I-BET762 treatment in culture (Supplemental
Table S4). In contrast, we observe no significant change
in the low-level expression of MYC in the LUCaP 145.2
model; although significant changes in MLKL and the
BET target gene BCL2 were detected (Figure 5D; [22]).
Consistent with our in vitro data, I-BET762 produced
little to no effect on ERG, or TMPRSS2-ERG expression
in either xenograft model (Figure 5C, 5D). AR expression
was undetectable in LUCaP 145.2, and we observed only
small, variable effects on AR expression in LuCaP 35CR.
I-BET762 treatment resulted in dose-dependent
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in the LuCaP 35CR model
(Figure 5E). The 25 mg/kg treatment group reached a
statistically-significant TGI of 57% (n=10, p=0.006). The
8 mg/kg group exhibited a 27% reduction in tumor growth;
however, this effect did not reach statistical significance.
In contrast, we observe no significant TGI in the LuCaP
145.2 model (Figure 5F). I-BET762 was well-tolerated in
both models at all doses tested (Supplemental Figure S7).
Our primary prostate xenograft studies therefore confirm
the activity we observed for I-BET762 in prostate cancer
cell lines, and highlight the potential of BET inhibitors
as therapeutic agents in prostate tumors with high MYC
expression.

DISCUSSION
In these studies, we demonstrate that BET proteins
regulate MYC levels in prostate cancer models and the
BET inhibitor, I-BET762, potently decreases MYC
expression in cell lines and a patient-derived model with
high MYC expression. Our experiments also show that
I-BET762 potently inhibits growth in a subset of cell lines

progression [31]. It is important to note that LNCaP and
VCaP cells express higher levels of BRD4 protein and may
be dependent on BRD4 to potentiate the G1/S transition.
Future studies will be aimed at determining the molecular
mechanisms of I-BET762 anti-growth phenotype in the
prostate tumor models to identify additional prostate
cancer patient populations that might benefit from BET
inhibitor treatment.
I-BET762 treatment had minimal effects on
expression of AR or its downstream target genes in
the LNCaP cell line under non-stimulating conditions
(Supplemental Table S3, Supplemental Figure S3). It
was previously reported that BRD2 is recruited to the
promoters of AR target genes upon androgen stimulation,
and that BRD2 recruitment and expression of AR targets
are diminished upon treatment with the BET inhibitor
JQ1 [25,32]. While we cannot rule out a potential role
of BET proteins in regulating expression of androgenstimulated gene expression programs, our data suggest
that perturbation of AR-driven pathways plays a minimal
role in cellular response to I-BET762 under normal growth
conditions.
In addition to the regulation of cellular growth in
prostate cancer models, BET inhibition results in the
induction of cell death in some cell lines (VCaP, Figure
1). Surprisingly, our microarray analyses suggest that
BET inhibition did not attenuate the expression of genes
involved in cell death pathways in the VCaP cell line,
but had an effect on the expression of cell death pathway
genes in a cell line with a weak, cytostatic response to
I-BET762, PC3 (Supplemental Table S2). Therefore, the
induction of cell death by I-BET762 in prostate models
may be context-dependent and will be investigated in
future studies.

of growth. T0 measurements were taken the following
day using Cell Titer-Glo (Promega) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were read on a Safire
2 (Tecan) plate reader. Remaining plates were treated
with DMSO or a titration of I-BET762 for 6 days and
developed as described above. Results were plotted as
a percent of the T0 value, (normalized to 100%) versus
compound concentration, and a 4-parameter equation was
used to generate concentration response curves. Growth
IC50 (gIC50) values correspond to the mid-point of the
growth window (between DMSO and T0 values).

Caspase 3/7 Assay
Caspase 3/7 assays were performed as described
previously [29]. Caspase-Glo 3/7 readings were
normalized to Cell Titer-Glo readings from the same
treatment group to correct for differences in cell number.
Results were plotted as fold-induction relative to DMSOtreated samples from the corresponding time point.

siRNA Transfections
Reverse siRNA transfections were performed using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) and 25nM siRNA. All siRNA were from
Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA). Catalog numbers
for individual siRNAs are listed in Supplemental Methods.
Western blot analysis
Lysates were generated in RIPA buffer (Sigma
Aldrich) containing 1x protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology), following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Protein concentration was
determined via BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA), using BSA as a standard. Equivalent
amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies
were diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) containing 0.05%
Tween-20 at the manufacturer’s recommended dilutions.
Images were obtained on an Odyssey infrared imaging
system (LI-COR Biosciences).

METHODS
Cell lines and Reagents
Cell lines were obtained from ATCC and
authenticated via STR profiling. All cell lines were
grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 2
mM GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), and 1 mM sodium
pyruvate. For androgen-dependent growth assays, LNCaP
cells were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI-1640
containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, and 10nM DHT.
Antibodies and qPCR primers are listed in Supplemental
Methods.

Cell Cycle analysis
Propidium iodide staining was performed using
the Cycletest Plus DNA reagent kit (BD Biosciences)
following the manufacturer’s instructions, and samples
were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). Histograms were generated and cell cycle
analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star,
Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

Cell Line Growth Assay
Cell line growth assays were performed as
previously described [29]. Briefly, cells were seeded into
96 or 384-well plates at a density optimized for 6 days

puromycin, cells were trypsinized, counted and plated
for growth-death analysis, cell cycle analysis, or Western

Two independent biological replicates of LNCaP,
VCaP, PC3, or NCI-H660 cells treated with DMSO, 0.5
µM, or 10 µM of I-BET762 for 24 hours were collected
and submitted to Expression Analysis (Durham, NC) for

individual samples, were processed by the Micro Array
Suite 5.0 (MAS5) algorithm (http://www.affymetrix.com/

target intensity of 500 and log2 transformed. Differentially
expressed probe sets were determined by fitting the data
to a linear model and carrying out pair-wise contrasts
of treatment versus control. Significant probe sets were
filtered for detection based on present/absent calling, an
average fold-change >2 or <−2, and P-values adjusted for
multiple testing correction by false discovery rate (FDR)
(Benjamin–Hochberg) < 0.1. Statistical analyses were
performed using the limma package from Bioconductor.
Significant probes for all treatments and cell lines are
provided in Supplemental Table S4.
(http://www.bioconductor.org/).
Functional analyses of gene lists in terms of
Gene Ontology Biology Process (GO BP) or pathway
enrichment were performed at the gene-level using DAVID
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) was performed using GenePattern
(18, 19). Gene set permutations were used to identify
significantly enriched gene sets from the c2 (curated gene
sets) and c3 (motif gene sets) MSigDB collections using
the signal-to-noise metric for vehicle versus I-BET762treated samples.

In vivo Studies
All studies were conducted after review by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at GSK and
in accordance with the GSK Policy on the Care, Welfare
and Treatment of Laboratory Animals. The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at GSK specifically
approved these studies. The LuCaP series of prostate
cancer xenograft lines was developed by co-author RV at
the University of Washington. LuCaP 35CR and LUCaP
145.2 models were passaged and grown in castrated male
beige SCID mice (CB17.B6-Prkdc<scid>Lyst<bg>,
Charles River Labs). Tumors were measured with calipers
and randomized using stratified sampling according to
tumor size into treatment groups of 10 mice. I-BET762
was prepared as a solution in 1% methylcellulose vehicle
containing 0.2% SDS. I-BET762 in vehicle or vehicle
alone was administered orally by individual body weight at
10 ml/kg. Mice were weighed and tumors were measured
with calipers twice weekly, and mice were observed
daily for any adverse treatment affects. All groups of
mice were supplemented with Diet Gel (ClearH2O)
throughout the study. Mice were euthanized using CO2
inhalation according to AVMA guidelines after two
consecutive tumor measurements greater than 2500 mm3,
or if body weight loss greater than 20% was observed.
For pharmacodynamic studies, mice were euthanized as
described above. Tumors were harvested from euthanized
mice and placed in RNAlater (Life Technologies) for RNA
isolation as described above.

qRT-PCR Analysis
RNA was purified using the RNEasy Mini kit
(Qiagen) and cDNA was generated using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life
Technologies), following the manufacturers’ instructions.
TaqMan analysis was performed on an Applied
Biosystems ViiA7 real-time PCR machine, using GAPDH
as an internal control. Relative expression compared to
DMSO was calculated using the Comparative Ct (Ct)
method following the manufacturer’s protocol (Life
Technologies).

We thank members of the Cancer Epigenetics DPU,
Molecular Medicines Unit, and Platform Technology and
Science group at GlaxoSmithKline for their support in
these studies. In particular, we thank Karen KennedyWilson, Lydia Sanchez, Gopinath Ganji, and Carolyn
Buser-Doepner for technical assistance, reagents, and
comments on the manuscript.

Lentiviral Transduction Experiments

REFERENCES

Infections were carried out in serum-free RPMI1640 media at an M.O.I. of 3 over a period of 24 hours.
Media containing virus was then removed and replaced
with normal growth media. The following day, transduced
cells were selected by the addition of 1 µg/ml puromycin
