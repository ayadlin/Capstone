Abstract
K-Ras mutations are frequently found in various cancers and
are associated with resistance to treatment or poor prognosis.
Similarly, poor outcomes have recently been observed in
cancer patients with overexpression of protein kinase C iota
(PKCI), an atypical protein kinase C that is activated by
oncogenic Ras protein and is required for K-Ras–induced
transformation and colonic carcinogenesis in vivo. Thus far,
there is no effective agent for treatment of cancers with K-Ras
mutations or PKCI overexpression. By synthetic lethality
screening, we identified a small compound (designated
oncrasin-1) that effectively kills various human lung cancer
cells with K-Ras mutations at low or submicromolar concentrations. The cytotoxic effects correlated with apoptosis
induction, as was evidenced by increase of apoptotic cells
and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 upon the treatment
of oncrasin-1 in sensitive cells. Treatment with oncrasin-1 also
led to abnormal aggregation of PKCI in the nucleus of sensitive cells but not in resistant cells. Furthermore, oncrasin-1–
induced apoptosis was blocked by siRNA of K-Ras or PKCI,
suggesting that oncrasin-1 is targeted to a novel K-Ras/PKCI
pathway. The in vivo administration of oncrasin-1 suppressed
the growth of K-ras mutant human lung tumor xenografts by
>70% and prolonged the survival of nude mice bearing these
tumors, without causing detectable toxicity. Our results
indicate that oncrasin-1 or its active analogues could be a
novel class of anticancer agents, which effectively kill K-Ras
mutant cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7403–8]

Introduction
Activating mutations of three oncogenic Ras genes—H-Ras,
K-Ras, and N-Ras—play important roles in tumorigenesis and the
maintenance of malignant phenotypes (1). Among them, K-Ras
mutations are the most frequently found in tumors, especially
adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, colon, and lung (1, 2). K-Ras
mutations are also associated with resistance to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy and, thus, a poor prognosis (3). Therefore, mutant Ras
proteins are important targets for anticancer therapy.
As a subfamily of small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins,
Ras proteins cycle between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form (4). Binding of Ras with GTP is facilitated
by guanine nucleotide exchange factors through catalyzing the
release of GDP and is required for the interaction of Ras with
target proteins (5). Ras mutations that diminish the GTPase activity

or decrease the GDP binding capacity render Ras constitutively
active and GTP bound. Ras protein can also be activated by other
mechanisms. In the absence of a Ras mutation, increased Ras
activity is frequently detected in human cancer because of gene
amplification (6), overexpression, and an increase in upstream
signals from tyrosine-kinase growth factor receptors such as
Her2 (7).
Because Ras proteins must be translocated to the inner leaflet of
the plasma membrane to be activated, agents were developed that
interrupt the posttranslational modifications required for Ras
trafficking to the plasma membrane as a means of suppressing Ras
function. One group of such agents is the farnesyltransferase
inhibitors (FTI), which have now been intensively investigated in
preclinical and clinical trials as a cancer therapy (8). This approach,
however, may be effective in preventing the membrane translocation of H-Ras, but not K-Ras and N-Ras, because in the presence of
FTIs, N-Ras and K-Ras proteins are geranylgeranylated and
transferred to the membrane (9, 10). Several phase II and phase
III clinical trials also showed that FTIs did not have significant
single-agent activity in lung, pancreatic, colorectal, bladder, and
prostate cancers (8). Thus, compounds with novel mechanisms of
action and high specificity for cancer cells with hyperactive Ras will
be valuable for anticancer therapy.
Synthetic lethality screening has recently emerged as a new
approach to identify cytotoxic agents targeted to cancer cells with
mutations in a particular gene (11). Using genetically defined cell
lines to screen compounds that kill cells with a particular mutant
gene only but not the normal counterparts will allow us to identify
compounds that target to a protein whose functional change is
synthetic lethal to an inactivated tumor suppressor gene or an
activated oncogene. Using this approach, we identified a small
molecule that can effectively kill K-Ras mutant cancer cells but not
normal isogenic cells or H-Ras or N-Ras mutant cancer cells. The
mechanistic studies revealed that apoptosis induction by this
compound is blocked by knockdown of K-Ras or protein kinase C
iota (PKCL), suggesting that oncrasin-1 is synthetic lethal to active
K-Ras and PKCL.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The human non–small cell lung carcinoma H1299, H322,
H460, H358, H2887, H2087, and A549 cell lines were routinely propagated in
a monolayer culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. The establishing of T29, T29Kt1, and T29Ht1 cells and in vitro and in vivo biological
characterization of those cell lines have been reported previously (12).
In vitro cell growth and/or cell cycle progression of those three cell lines
were similar. The cells were maintained in DMEM with the same
supplements. All cells were maintained in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37jC.
Chemicals and antibodies. A chemical library with 10,000 compounds,
including oncrasin-1, was obtained from Chembridge Corporation. The
chemicals in the library are provided at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in

DMSO. Antibodies to the following proteins were used for the Western blot
analysis: PKCL, PKC~, Raf-1, and caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
caspase-8 (PharMingen); and h-actin (Sigma).
Cell viability assay. The inhibitory effects of oncrasin-1 and other
agents on cell growth were determined by using the sulforhodamine B
(SRB) assay, as described previously (13). Each experiment was performed in
quadruplicate and repeated at least thrice. The IC50 value, a dose that
causes a 50% reduction in surviving cells compared with the number of
control cells, was determined by using the CurveExpert Version 1.3
program.
Flow cytometry assay. Cells were seeded at a density of 1  106 cells per
dish in 100-mm dishes and allowed to grow overnight. After the treatment,
cells were harvested with trypsin and washed twice with PBS. Cells were
fixed with 75% ethanol at the cell density of 1  106 cells/mL overnight.
Next, the cell pellets were harvested and resuspended with propidium
iodide (PharMingen) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. The cells
were analyzed using an EPICS Profile II flow cytometer (Coulter Corp.) with
the Multicycle Phoenix Flow Systems program (Phoenix Flow Systems).
All experiments were repeated thrice.
Western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Western blot analysis
was performed as we have previous described (14). For immunofluorescent
staining, cells were seeded at a density of 1  105 cells per well in 6-well
plates containing a 1% gelatin–treated cover slide. Cells were allowed to
grow overnight. Cells were treated with different compounds or radiation
as indicated. After the treatment, cells were washed with PBS twice, then
fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeablized with 0.1%
Triton-100 for 20 min, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h.
The slides were incubated with primary antibodies followed by FITC or
Rhodamine-linked secondary antibodies. After PBS wash thrice, the slides
were taken out and mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent
(Molecular Probes). The slides were read under Olympus fluorescence
microscope (Olympus).
Animal experiments. Animal experiments were carried out in
accordance with Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(NIH publication number 85–23) and the institutional guidelines of M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center. S.c. tumors were established in 4- to 6-wk-old
female nude mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc.) by inoculation of

1.5  106 H460 cells into the dorsal flank of each mouse. After the tumors
grew to 2 to 3 mm in diameter, the mice were treated with i.p.
administration of oncrasin-1 at a dose of 100 mg/kg/d (dissolved in
0.5 mL solvent containing 10% DMSO, 10% Cremophore EL, and 10%
ethanol) or solvent alone. Tumor volumes were calculated by using the
formula a  b 2  0.5, where a and b represented the larger and smaller
diameters, respectively. Mice were killed when the tumors grew to 15 mm
in diameter. To evaluate the toxicity of treatment, blood samples were
collected from the tail vein before treatment, and 2 d after the last
treatment, and serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase,
blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels were determined as described
elsewhere (15).
Statistical analysis. Differences between the treatment groups were
assessed by ANOVA using statistical software (StatSoft). Differences
between the results of the in vivo tumor growth experiment were assessed
using ANOVA with a repeated measurement module. P values of <0.05 were
regarded as significant.

Results
Library screening for oncogenic Ras-targeted compounds.
We used human ovarian surface epithelial cells immortalized with
the catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
and the SV40 early genomic region (designated T29), and its
tumorigenic derivatives transformed with either mutant H-Ras
(T29Ht1) or mutant K-Ras (T29Kt1; ref. 12), to screen a chemical
library from Chembridge Corporation for compounds that showed
an ability to selectively kill tumor cells. Cells seeded in a 96-well
plate were treated with each compound at a final concentration of
f5 Ag/mL (f20–30 Amol/L). Cells treated with solvent (DMSO)
were used as controls. A lethal effect was determined in a SRB

A Synthetic Lethal Compound for K-Ras/PKCi

assay 4 days after treatment (13). Compounds found to kill >50% of
cells were then subjected to two additional dose-response tests to
confirm the SRB assay finding. Among 10,000 compounds screened,
we identified a compound, 1-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-1H-indole3-carboxaldehyde, designated oncrasin-1 (oncogenic Ras tumor–
inhibiting compound 1), that was highly selective for T29Kt1 cells
at a wide range of doses (Fig. 1A and B). Oncrasin-1 induced dosedependent cytotoxicity in T29Kt1 cells, with a IC50 of 4.81 Amol/L.
In contrast, no cytotoxicity was detectable in T29 or T29Ht1 cells
with concentrations of 33 Amol/L, the highest we tested.
Testing of oncrasin-1 on native human cancer cell lines showed
that it effectively killed K-Ras-mutant H460, H2122, H2887, and
A549 cells with an IC50 of V3 Amol/L (Fig. 1C). However, oncrasin-1
had minimal effects on normal human bronchial epithelial cells. It
also had minimal effects on H322 and H1395 lung cancer cells,
which have wild-type Ras genes, and on H1299 and H2087 lung
cancer cells, which harbor mutant N-Ras genes. Those results
suggested that oncrasin-1 is effective against various lung cancer
cells with K-Ras mutations.
Induction of apoptosis by oncrasin-1. Chemically, this
compound has the same core structure as indole-3-carbinol, a
naturally occurring constituent of many plant food that has been
tested for the prevention and treatment of cancer (16). It has also
structural similarity to lonidamine (17), which have been evaluated
preclinically and clinically for treatment of cancers. However, both
indole-3-carbinol and lonidamine did not have any cytotoxic effects
in T29, T29Kt1, T29Ht1, and H460 cells at any of the concentrations
tested (up to 100 Amol/L; data not shown), suggesting that
oncrasin-1 may have different anticancer mechanisms from those
two agents.
To determine whether the antitumor activity of oncrasin-1 is due
to the suppression of cell proliferation or to cell killing, we
performed flow cytometric analysis after treatment with oncrasin-1
at 10 Amol/L ( for T29 or T29Kt1 cells) or 1 Amol/L ( for H460 cells),
the doses of fIC80 for T29Kt1 and H460, respectively. At 12 hours
after the treatment with oncrasin-1, apoptotic cells account for
47.2% in H460 and 33.2% in T29Kt1 cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast,
apoptotic cells in H460 and T29Kt1 cells, which were treated with
DMSO, and in the T29 cells treated with oncrasin-1 were <3.1%.
This result indicated that oncrasin-1 can effectively induce cell
killing in T29Kt1 and H460 cells and that apoptosis induction is a
major mechanism of oncrasin-1–induced cell killing. Western blot
analysis showed further that the treatment of H460 cells with
1 Amol/L oncrasin-1 effectively activated caspases 3 and 8 (Fig. 2B),
whereas treatment with DMSO or indole-3-carbinol at 30 Amol/L
did not induce detectable cleavages of the caspases, indicating that

its cytotoxic effect in cancer cells is due to its induction of
apoptosis.
K-Ras is required for effective apoptosis induction by
oncrasin-1. Because oncrasin-1 was identified by synthetic
lethality screening of K-Ras-mutant cells, we investigated the role
of the K-Ras gene in oncrasin-induced cell death. We treated H460
cells with 200 pmol/L K-Ras–specific siRNA or control siRNA for
24 hours. The cells were then treated with DMSO or 1 Amol/L
oncrasin-1. After another 12 hours, the cells were harvested for
apoptosis detection using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis. The cell lysate was also used to detect K-Ras gene
expression. The results showed that treatment with K-Ras–specific
siRNA but not with control siRNA suppressed K-Ras expression in
H460 cells. Cells transfected with either K-Ras siRNA or control
siRNA alone had a background apoptosis level of f9% to 11%.
Nevertheless, in cells treated with control siRNA, oncrasin-1
resulted in an increase of f17% of apoptotic cells, compared with
that of DMSO + siRNA–treated cells. In contrast, in K-Ras siRNA–
treated cells, treatment with oncrasin-1 yielded only f3% increase
in apoptotic cells when compared with DMSO + siRNA–treated
cells (Fig. 3). This result showed that K-Ras activity is required for
oncrasin-1 to induce apoptosis in H460 cells.
Oncrasin-1 induced abnormal aggregation of PKCI in
nucleus. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis
induction by oncrasin-1, we determined the levels and/or phosphorylation status of several proteins that are involved in apoptosis
and/or Ras signaling pathways, including Bax, Bik, Bcl2, and Bcl-XL
in apoptosis pathway, and Raf-1, B-Raf, Akt, Mst1, and the atypical
PKC (aPKC), PKC~, and PKCL in Ras signaling pathway. Western
blot analysis of those molecules produced little elucidative information about mechanisms of oncrasin-1–induced apoptosis (data
not shown).
Because Ras proteins execute their biological functions mainly in
cell membranes, through interacting with a diversity of membrane
receptors and modulating signal transduction of a variety signaling
pathways that govern cell growth, proliferation, differentiation,
and death, we then tested the subcellular localization of several
molecules involved in the Ras signaling pathway. Treatment with
oncrasin-1 induced no obvious changes in the subcellular
localization of Raf-1, B-Raf, Akt, PKC~, PKCy, and p53. However,
a substantial change in the subcellular localization of PKCL was
detected after oncrasin-1 treatment (Fig. 4). In both H460 and
T29Kt1 cells, both PKCL and PKC~ were diffusely distributed, with
high concentrations or tiny dots on some area, especially in the
nucleus and on the cell membrane, findings that are consistent
with previous ones that aPKCs contain both nuclear localization

signals and nuclear export signals and can shuttle between the
cytoplasm and the nucleus (18). Whereas treatment with oncrasin1 resulted in no obvious changes in the subcellular localization of
PKC~, the same treatment resulted in formation of large foci of
PKCL in nuclei of both T29Kt1 and H460 cells (Fig. 4) but not in
oncrasin-1–resistant T29 and H1299 cells. We then tested whether
aggregation of PKCL into large nuclear foci is inducible by other
chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel. The
results showed that treatment of T29Kt1 cells with the chemotherapeutic agents 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, or with radiation at
doses that resulted in cell killing similar to that caused by oncrasin1 did not induce aggregation of PKCL in the nuclei, suggesting that
such aggregation is not a general phenomenon occurring in dying
cells (data not shown).
Roles of PKCI in oncrasin-induced apoptosis. To investigate
the possible role of PKCL in oncrasin-1–mediated cytotoxicity, we

knocked down PKCL in T29Kt1 cells by using plasmids encoding
shRNA for PKCL or PKC~ provided by the Origene Corporation. The
plasmids were transfected to T29Kt1 cells by using FuGENE 6
(Roche Diagnostics Corp.) as instructed by the manufacturer. Cells
were pooled together after a brief selection with puromycin and
tested for levels of PKCL expression. Cell viability analysis showed
that stable knockdown of PKCL f50% in T29Kt1 cells by siRNA
constructs resulted in almost complete resistance to oncrasin-1
(Fig. 5A). The IC50 in PKCL-knockdown T29Kt1 cells was 100 times
higher than it was in parental T29Kt1 cells. This value was comparable with that of oncrasin-resistant T29 cells. In contrast, transfection with PKC~ shRNA encoded by the same vector system did
not change the susceptibility of T29Kt1 cells to oncrasin-1. Immunofluorescent analysis showed that knockdown of PKCL in T29Kt1
cells abolished the abnormal aggregation of nuclear PKCL (Fig. 5B),
consisting with the results observed in T29 cells. Together, those
results indicated that oncrasin-1 has synthetic lethality for PKCL.
Antitumor activity in vivo. We also investigated the in vivo
antitumor activity of oncrasin-1. For this purpose, 1.5  106 H460
cells were inoculated into the dorsal flank of each nude mouse.
After the tumors grew to 2 to 3 mm in diameter, the mice were
treated with i.p. injections of oncrasin-1 for 10 days at a dose of
100 mg/kg/injection daily, or they were given i.p. injections of
solvent alone. The tumor volumes were monitored every other day.
Blood samples were collected from the tail vein before treatment
and 2 days after the last treatment for testing of serum liver
enzymes. The results showed that, in comparison with solvent,
oncrasin-1 suppressed tumor growth by 75.4% (Fig. 6A). Treatment
with oncrasin-1 also prolonged survival (Fig. 6B): the mean survival
times for mice treated with solvent and oncrasin-1 were 24 and 32,
respectively. No differences were observed in the body weights of
mice treated with solvent or oncrasin-1. In addition, the serum
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine levels were within the reference ranges in all mice tested,
regardless of the treatment received, suggesting that in vivo
antitumor activity can be achieved without observable toxicity.

oncrasin-1 for 12 h, and then immunofluorescent staining was performed to test for intracellular localization of PKCL. Nuclear PKCL aggregated into large foci after
oncrasin-1 treatment in sensitive T29Kt1 and H460 cells but not in the resistant T29 cells.

A Synthetic Lethal Compound for K-Ras/PKCi

induced cytotoxicity. A, susceptibility to
oncrasin-1 after PKCL knockdown. Six
plasmids encoding PKCL-specific shRNA
were divided into two groups (PKCL i-1 and
PKCL i-2) and were used in the experiment.
PKC~ shRNA plasmids (a mixture of four)
were used as a control. Cell viability was
determined as described in Fig. 1. Western
blot analysis of PKCL in T29Kt1 cells
after plasmid transfection and a brief
selection was also shown. B, knockdown
of PKCL abolished abnormal nuclear
PKCL aggregation. The experiment was
performed as described in Figure 4.

Those data showed that oncrasin-1 might be useful for the
treatment of cancers with K-Ras mutations.

Discussion
Synthetic lethality was originally called a lethal phenotype
caused by mutations of two genes (19); i.e., mutations of the two
genes are viable if they occur separately, but if they occur together,
the combination is lethal. A synthetic lethal phenotype often
indicates that the two genes or two related pathways affect a
common essential biological function. Assume that the biological
event E, which is critical for the cell to survive, is affected by signals
A and B. Signal A is transduced via proteins A1, A2, and A3,
whereas signal B is transduced via B1, B2, and B3 and then to E. An
abnormality occurring in either signal pathway is insufficient to
cause dysfunction of E; therefore, cell is viable. However,
abnormalities in both signal pathways lead to the disorder of E
and thus to cell death. In this case, A1 is synthetic lethal with B1,
B2, or B3 but not with A2 or A3, and vice versa. Nevertheless, our
current knowledge of molecular networks in normal or cancer cells
is not adequate for us to predict what genes are synthetic lethal to
an oncogene. The advantage of synthetic lethality screening is that
a compound targeting to a protein that is synthetic lethal to an
oncogenic protein can be identified, without prior knowledge of

such a protein target. The disadvantage of this approach is that
identifying targets of such a compound remains challenging. On
the basis of our results, we hypothesize that oncrasin-1 affect some
cellular targets that share an essential biological function with the
K-Ras/PKCL pathway. Oncrasin-1 may not function by inhibition of
K-Ras or PKCL activities but require K-Ras or PKCL activity for its
apoptosis induction in cancer cells because it did not inhibit PKCL
activity in an in vitro enzyme assay with recombinant PKCL protein
nor inhibit S35-GTPg binding to K-Ras (data not shown), and
because the siRNAs of K-Ras and PKCL induced an antagonistic but
not an additive effect with oncrasin-1. Although the direct target
or targets of the oncrasin-1 remain to be characterized, our results
led us to hypothesize that it affects some cellular targets whose
reduced or enhanced activity is lethal for cancer cells with increased
K-Ras and/or PKCL activity. In fact, oncogenic Ras can induce either
cell transformation or apoptosis, depending on cell types and
contexts (20, 21). Expression of oncogenic Ras in primary human or
rodent cells often results in apoptosis or senescence, whereas
expression of oncogenic Ras in immortal cells or cells with inactivation of p53, p16, or the transcriptional activator IFN regulatory
factor 1 leads to transformation and tumorigenesis (20, 21). It is
possible that, in comparison with cancer cells, the cellular targets
of oncrasin-1 in primary cells are at hypostatus or hyperstatus that
is not viably compatible with increased K-Ras/PKCL activity.

Cancer Research

K-Ras mutations are frequently found in various types of human
cancer and often associated with resistance to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy, including novel anticancer agents such as cetuximab and erlotinib (22). As a result, the outcome for cancer
patients with K-Ras mutations is frequently poor (23). Similarly,
poor outcomes have recently been observed in cancer patients
with overexpression of PKCL (24, 25). Unlike other protein
kinase C, PKC~ and PKCL are insensitive to regulation by
diacylglycerol, Ca2+, or phorbol esters but are activated by
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its lipid product phosphotidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3; ref. 26). Phosphorylation of
Thr410 (PKC~)/Thr403 (PKCL) in aPKCs by 3-phosphoinositide–
dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is PI3K dependent and
serves as a direct on-off switch for the aPKCs (27). PDK1 is a
constitutively active kinase, although its access to substrates is
regulated by phosphoinositides (28). Ras directly interacts in
a GTP-dependent manner with the catalytic subunit of the
PI3Ks and activates them (29, 30), leading to the generation of a
short-lived second-messenger product such as PIP3 and to the
activation of many PI3K/PDK1-dependent kinases, including
aPKCs (27) and Akt (31). Moreover, Ras proteins can directly
interact with aPKCs in vitro and in vivo, regulating the activities
of the aPKCs (32). Thus, the aPKCs might function as Ras
downstream effectors, mediating signal transduction in certain
important Ras signaling pathways (33). A recent study showed
that PKCL is required for K-Ras–induced transformation and
colonic carcinogenesis in vivo (34). Nevertheless, how K-Ras and

PKCL interact and what signal transduction they mediate remain
to be characterized. Our study showed that treatment with
oncrasin-1 led to aggregation of nuclear PKCL into large foci.
Whether this abnormal PKCL aggregation is related to oncrasin-1–
induced apoptosis is not yet clear, although this phonotype is only
observed in sensitive cells. Because of the critical roles of
increased K-Ras/PKCL activity in oncogenesis and in the poor
outcome of cancer patients (23, 25), oncrasin-1 or its analogues
that can induce synthetic lethality with oncogenic K-Ras and PKCL
can be useful agents for cancer treatment or useful tools for
characterizing biological functions of oncogenic K-Ras and PKCL,
although the direct targets of oncrasin-1 are not yet clear.
