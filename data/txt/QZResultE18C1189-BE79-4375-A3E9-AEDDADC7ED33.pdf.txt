ABSTRACT
Loss of polarity and quiescence along with increased cellular invasiveness
are associated with breast tumor progression. ROCK plays a central role in actincytoskeletal rearrangement. We used physiologically relevant 3D cultures of
nonmalignant and cancer cells in gels made of laminin-rich extracellular matrix, to
investigate ROCK function. Whereas expression levels of ROCK1 and ROCK2 were
elevated in cancer cells compared to nonmalignant cells, this was not observed in 2D
cultures. Malignant cells showed increased phosphorylation of MLC, corresponding
to disorganized F-actin. Inhibition of ROCK signaling restored polarity, decreased
disorganization of F-actin, and led to reduction of proliferation. Inhibition of ROCK
also decreased EGFR and Integrinβ1 levels, and consequently suppressed activation
of Akt, MAPK and FAK as well as GLUT3 and LDHA levels. Again, ROCK inhibition
did not inhibit these molecules in 2D. A triple negative breast cancer cell line,
which lacks E-cadherin, had high levels of ROCK but was less sensitive to ROCK
inhibitors. Exogenous overexpression of E-cadherin, however, rendered these cells
strikingly sensitive to ROCK inhibition. Our results add to the growing literature that
demonstrate the importance of context and tissue architecture in determining not
only regulation of normal and malignant phenotypes but also drug response.

INTRODUCTION

Activation of ROCK leads to direct phosphorylation of
myosin light chain (MLC) and indirect phosphorylation
of MLC through inhibition of myosin phosphatase, these
events result in actin-myosin contraction. ROCK also
phosphorylates LIM kinase (LIMK) causing activation of
LIMK, which inhibits cofilin, an actin-depolymerization
factor, ultimately reducing depolymerization of actin
filaments [5-7].
Breast cancer is the most common cancer
among women. Both maintenance of architecture and
function of glandular epithelia depend on the tissue
microenvironment, which includes growth factors,
extracellular matrix and neighboring stromal cells [8].
During breast cancer progression, tissue polarity is lost
and regulation of cell proliferation is abrogated [8].
Acquisition of invasive properties and degradation of the
extracellular matrix allow cancer cells to invade into the
neighboring tissues, lymphatics, and blood vessels [8].

Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) is an
evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, which
interacts with RhoA-GTP [1-4]. In humans, ROCK has
two homologs: ROCK1 and ROCK2, the genes of which
are located on the 18q11 and 2p24 chromosomal regions,
respectively. ROCK1 and ROCK2 share 65% overall
identity and 92% in their kinase domain at the amino acid
sequence level [1, 5]. Both ROCK1 and ROCK2 play
key roles in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, controlling cell
shape, cell migration, cell motility, cell proliferation and
apoptosis [5, 6]. The RhoA/ROCK pathway is activated
by several growth factors, adhesion molecules, integrins,
and other biologically active substances when bound to
their cognate receptors [5-7]. A number of downstream
targets of ROCK regulate the assembly of filamentous
actin (F-actin) and actin-myosin contractility [5 6].

These alterations eventually enable cancer cells to spread
into distant organs and metastasize [8]. mRNA and protein
expression of ROCK1, ROCK2 and RhoA are increased
in the tissue of breast cancer patients; however, only the
increased levels of ROCK1 and RhoA correlate with poor
patient prognosis [9-13]. Overexpression of RhoA induces
pre-neoplastic transformation in mammary epithelial cells
[14]. It has also been reported using breast cancer cell
lines that ROCK is involved in cancer cell invasion [15,
16].
Observations made using 2D cultures often miss
or contradict physiological or clinical findings, whereas
observations from 3D cultures are of clinical relevance
[17, 18] thus we chose to study the function of ROCK
in breast cell lines using physiologically relevant 3D
cultures. In order to analyze ROCK function in epithelial
homeostasis, we cultured the cell lines of the HMT3522
breast cancer progression series (nonmalignant S1 and
their isogenic malignant counterpart T4-2) within 3D
laminin-rich ECM (lrECM) gels [19, 20]. Laminin-111
(Ln1) is one of the principal constituents of basement
membrane that plays a central role in maintenance of the
differentiation status and morphogenesis in breast tissue
[21]. In 3D lrECM, nonmalignant S1 cells form polarized,
multi-cellular growth-arrested and luminal-like colonies in
response to the Ln-1 in the basement membrane; the S1
colonies resemble the alveolar structures of normal human
mammary tissue, referred to as acini. In contrast, under the
same conditions, malignant T4-2 cells form disorganized
and non-polar colonies that grow continuously [19, 20].
EGF receptor (EGFR), integrin, and aerobic glycolysis
-signaling pathways are hyperactivated in malignant T4-2
cells [22-24], and reciprocal interactions among these
pathways occur in T4-2 cells when grown in 3D lrECM
[22-24]. Importantly, we have demonstrated inhibition
of various signaling pathways enables T4-2 cells to form
polarized and growth-arrested colonies (without any
change in their genotype), and they look similar to the
colonies formed by nonmalignant S1 cells [22-25] in a
process called ‘‘phenotypic reversion.” This 3D lrECM
culture system has been applied to many breast epithelial
cell lines [26, 27] including MCF10A and MDA-MB-231
cells. The resulting 3D morphology of the colonies
is used to phenotypically distinguish malignant from
nonmalignant cell lines [26, 27].
We previously demonstrated that T4-2 cells in 3D
IrECM show disorganized cytoskeletal F-actin [22, 23]
and increased expression of genes involved in cytoskeleton
organization [25]. Thus, we postulated that cytoskeletal
rearrangement induced by deregulation of RhoA/ROCK
pathway is a critical step in breast cancer progression. We
found that RhoA, ROCK1, ROCK2 and phosphorylated
MLC, which is downstream of the RhoA/ROCK signaling
pathway, were increased in T4-2 cells compared with S1
cells. Inhibition of ROCK considerably improved polarity,
and suppressed proliferation and invasion in T4-2 cells,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

while only slightly affecting S1 cells. Inhibition of ROCK
caused coordinated down-regulation of the EGFR and
integrinβ1 signaling pathways. This down-regulation was
evident in 3D cultures, but not observed in 2D cultures,
highlighting the importance of studying these pathways
under physiologically relevant conditions. Inhibition of
ROCK also converted aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells
lacking E-cadherin into a less malignant phenotype.
The combination of overexpression of E-cadherin
and inhibition of ROCK induced apoptosis in MDAMB-231 cells. These observations are consistent with
our hypothesis that RhoA/ROCK signaling contributes to
breast cancer progression. Furthermore, these results may
provide information in order to develop novel therapeutic
targets and strategies for treatment of breast cancer.

RESULTS
Expression of ROCK in cultures of 3D lrECM is
elevated in malignant T4-2 cells as compared to
nonmalignant S1 cells
To understand the role of ROCK signaling in breast
cancer, we utilized cell lines from our well-characterized
human breast cancer progression series, the HMT 3522
nonmalignant S1 cells and the malignant T4-2 cells [2225]. Previous work uncovered many aspects of signal
integration that allow for the nonmalignant S1 cells to
form organized and polar growth arrested colonies when
grown in 3D gels of lrECM [22-25]. These signaling
pathways have gone awry in the T4-2 cells and in other
breast cancer cell lines we have examined [22-27].
Although we know a great deal about how signals from
the microenvironment are transduced via intracellular
signaling, there are still signaling nodes that remain to be
investigated in order to completely ‘close the loop’ on how
an acinus is formed and maintained within breast tissue.
ROCK and RhoA are within a signaling pathway
that is often misregulated in breast cancer progression
[9-16]. Thus, we examined the expression of ROCK and
RhoA in nonmalignant S1 cells and their counterpart
malignant T4-2 cells using monolayer plastic (2D) culture
and 3D lrECM gel culture. Immunoblot showed that T4-2
cells produce higher amounts of Integrinβ1 and EGFR as
compared to S1 cells, irrespective of whether cultured in
2D or 3D lrECM culture (Figure 1B). These observations
were consistent with previous results from our laboratory
[22-25]. Expressions of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 in 2D
culture were barely detectable and were similar between
S1 and T4-2 cells but levels of ROCK1 and ROCK2
were substantially elevated in T4-2 cells grown in 3D
lrECM. Expression pattern of RhoA, which is an upstream
effector of ROCK, was similar to that of Integrinβ1 and
EGFR in S1 and T4-2 cells, in that the levels of RhoA

were higher in T4-2 cells regardless of whether cells
were cultured in 2D or 3D (Figure 1B). Quantification
of ROCK1 and ROCK2 mRNAs corroborated results
from the immunoblot (Figure 1A). ROCK directly and
indirectly phosphorylates myosin light chain (MLC),
leading to actin-myosin contraction [1, 5-7] and we found
phosphorylated MLC was especially enhanced in T4-2
cells in 3D lrECM (Figure 1B), suggesting that RhoA/
ROCK signaling is indeed activated in T4-2 cells grown
in 3D lrECM. Our observations using our physiologically
relevant 3D culture system are consistent with several
studies using clinical samples of breast cancer, which have
shown expression of RhoA and ROCK1 are upregulated
in the tumor tissue [9-13], thus, supporting the use of this
culture system for the investigation of ROCK signaling in

breast cancer progression.

RhoA/ROCK activity correlates with disrupted
acinar architecture of breast cancer cells grown
in 3D lrECM
We previously utilized this 3D lrECM gel
culture assay to identify the involvement of several
signaling pathways, such as EGFR, integrin and glucose
metabolism, among others [22-25]. Moreover, inhibition
or normalization of signaling pathways leads to phenotypic
reversion of breast tumor cells, where T4-2 cells are able
to form acinar-like structures which are similar to the
nonmalignant S1 cells [22-25]. To evaluate functional

involvement of ROCK in the malignant phenotype of T4-2
cells, we applied two different ROCK inhibitors Y-27632
[28] and Fasudil [29], which are well-characterized
specific ROCK inhibitors with differing chemical
structure [1, 5, 6]. Both inhibitors suppress the function of
ROCK1 and ROCK2 by inhibition of kinase activity in a
competitive manner with ATP [1, 5, 6, 30, 31]. We found
that these two ROCK inhibitors reduced the disorganized
phenotype of T4-2 cells in 3D lrECM in a concentrationdependent manner (3~100 µM) (Figure 2A). To determine
if the ROCK inhibitors decreased proliferation, cells were

extracted from the lrECM gel culture and the protein
concentration of the cells was used as a surrogate marker
for proliferation. We found the protein concentration of
T4-2 cells treated with ROCK inhibitors was decreased
(data not shown). Both ROCK inhibitors suppressed cell
proliferation of T4-2 cells in a manner comparable to the
EGFR inhibitor (AG1478, 0.1 µM), Integrinβ1 blocking
antibody (AIIB, 100 µg/mL), EGFR blocking antibody
(mAB225, 4 µg/mL) or the MEK inhibitor (PD98059, 10
µM) (Figure 2B), all of which were shown to revert the
malignant phenotype of T4-2 cells [22, 23]. The higher

concentration of ROCK inhibitors was required to suppress
cell proliferation in comparison with the concentration
of EGFR inhibitor and MEK inhibitor (Figure 2B). The
ROCK inhibitor (Y-26732) decreased phosphorylation
of MLC, which is a downstream target of ROCK (Figure
2C). In the same concentration range where the reduction
of MLC phosphorylation was observed, we found downmodulation of the levels of EGFR and Integrinβ1 (Figure
2C), which we previously showed are hallmarks for T4-2
cells phenotypic reversion [23]. We recently reported that
levels of GLUT3 (the facilitative glucose transporter 3
encoded by SLC2A3), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)
and other aerobic glycolysis-related proteins, are increased
in T4-2 cells and that the high levels of GLUT3 contribute
to the malignant phenotype [24]. Inhibition of ROCK
also reduced the amount of GLUT3 and LDHA proteins
(Figure 2C). Interestingly, we found that inhibition of
ROCK showed a decrease in ROCK1 protein itself (Figure
2C). The reverted morphological phenotype of T4-2
cells resulting from ROCK inhibition was similar to the
phenotype observed by inhibition of EGFR, Integrinβ1
or MEK in T4-2 cells and similar to the phenotype of
nonmalignant S1 cells (Figure 3A). S1 cells in 3D lrECM
form polarized colonies, as indicated by the basal location
of integrinα6, localized β-catenin at the lateral cell-cell
junction and well-organized F-actin (Figure 3B, 3C and
3D). Inhibition of ROCK exhibited improvement of basal
polarity and β-catenin localization, and the decrease in
disorganized F-actin in T4-2 cells (Figure 3B, 3C and
3D). We also observed that another ROCK inhibitor
(GSK-429286, [32]) induced the reversion of phenotype
of T4-2 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that an
overactive ROCK pathway leads to an impairment in the
ability of breast cells to form and maintain an organized,
polar and quiescent acinar structure, and contributes to the
malignant phenotype of breast epithelial cells.

26732), MEK inhibitor (PD98059) or EGFR inhibitor
(AG1478) (Figure 4B).
Based on this information, we hypothesized that the
other signaling pathways integrate or modulate RhoA/
ROCK signaling in T4-2 cells and vice versa. To test this,
we investigated protein expression and phosphorylation
of key molecules. Protein expression of RhoA, ROCK1
and ROCK2 was decreased by treatment with EGFR
inhibitor (AG1478, 0.1 µM), MEK inhibitor (PD98059,
10 µM), Integrinβ1 function blocking antibody (AIIB,
100 µg/mL) and EGFR function blocking antibody
(mAB225, 4 µg/mL) (Figure 5A), and consequently
reduced phosphorylation level of MLC in T4-2 cells
(Figure 5B). Two ROCK inhibitors (Y-27632 and Fasudil,
30 µM) caused a decrease in both EGFR and Integrinβ1
protein levels (Figure 5A), also as demonstrated above
(Figure 2D). In accordance with the decrease in these
receptor proteins, phosphorylation levels of AKT,
ERK1/2 and FAK, which are downstream molecules
of EGFR and Integrinβ1, were reduced when ROCK
was inhibited (Figure 5B). Furthermore, these reversion
agents, including the ROCK inhibitor Y-26735, reduced
the levels of GLUT3 and LDHA proteins in T4-2 cells
(Figure 5A). These observations suggest that the ROCK
signaling pathways are integrated with other signaling
pathways previously investigated in the laboratory and
found to be essential signaling nodes for correct acinar
formation. Disruption of these pathways leads to a
malignant phenotype observed in the T4-2 cells and other
breast cancer cells.
Inhibition of ROCK reduced actin-stress fibers, and
induced morphological changes in T4-2 cells grown in
2D (Figure S1A). In spite of phenotypic changes, EGFR,
Integrinβ1, GLUT3, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and LDHA
were not down-modulated by ROCK inhibitor in the 2D
cultures (Figure S1B). This contrasts with observation
that these proteins were down-regulated by inhibition
of ROCK in 3D (Figure 2C, Figure 5A and Figure 5B),
indicating that the events causing the morphological
changes observed in 2D culture are insufficient or not
integrated correctly in order to down-regulate crosssignaling among these pathways that we have previously
identified as critical for acinar formation. These results
also support our hypothesis that cell-ECM interaction and/
or 3D structure is crucial for reciprocal interaction among
these signaling pathways.

The RhoA/ROCK pathway integrates with other
signaling pathways disrupted in T4-2 cells and
gives rise to the malignant phenotype
We previously compared gene expression profiles of
S1 cells, T4-2 cells and T4-2 cells phenotypically reverted
by a number of inhibitors and blocking antibodies [25]. We
identified an increase in expression of genes involved in
actin organization in T4-2 cells using gene set enrichment
analysis [25]. Here, we revisited the microarray data and
found that ROCK1 mRNA was increased in T4-2 cells
compared with S1 cells (Figure 4A). In addition, ROCK1
mRNA expression was commonly down-regulated in
the reverted T4-2 cells just as we observed the downregulation of the mRNA for EGFR, GLUT3, LDHA
and c-MYC (Figure 4A). Using quantitative PCR, we
confirmed that mRNA of ROCK1 and ROCK2 were
decreased in T4-2 cells treated with ROCK inhibitor (Ywww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Increased ROCK activity disrupts the
nonmalignant phenotype of breast epithelial cells
We further examined effects of ROCK function
in nonmalignant S1 cells since these cells express less
RhoA and ROCK proteins than T4-2 cells (Figure 1A).

β-catenin, respectively, exhibited organized F-actin and
formed acinus-like structure (Figure S2A). In contrast to
T4-2 cells, two ROCK inhibitors (Y-27632 and Fasudil,
30 µM) had no apparent effects on these phenotypic
parameters in S1 cells (Figure S2A). Inhibition of ROCK
only moderately affected cell proliferation (Figure S2B).

These inhibitors did not induce down-regulation of protein
expression of EGFR, Integrinβ1, GLUT3, phosphorylated
ERK1/2 and LDHA (Figure S2C). These moderate effects
of ROCK inhibition are most likely attributed to a less
activated RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in S1 cells as
compared to T4-2 cells, as described above (Figure 1).

We also investigated effects of increased ROCK
activity on nonmalignant breast cells using the MCF10A
cell line. Like S1 cells, MCF10A cells form polarized
luminal structures (Figure 6). Transfection of MCF10A
cells with ROCKΔ3, which is known as a constitutively
active ROCK mutant [33], significantly increased the
number of disorganized colonies compared with vector
control when cultured in 3D lrECM gels (Figure 6A).
The number of disorganized colonies of MCF10A cells

transfected with ROCKΔ3 was reasonable in the sense that
the transfection efficiency was 20-30 percent using EGFPexpressing plasmid (data not shown). In addition, the
disorganized colonies of MCF10A cells transfected with
ROCKΔ3 showed no lumen and loss of polarity (Figure
6B and 6C), suggesting that hyperactivation of ROCK
activity disrupts the ability of the epithelial cells to form
correct structural organization.

3D culture conditions. According to their morphologies,
those cell lines were classified into four groups [27].
Of these four groups, stellate types, including MDAMB-231, are more invasive and proliferative in 3D
culture [27]. Based on the fact that MDA-MB-231, a
well-characterized triple negative breast cancer cell
line, is invasive, metastatic and lacks E-cadherin [26],
MDA-MB-231 cells were chosen for further analysis. In
agreement with previous findings [26, 27], MDA-MB-231
cells showed more disruptive phenotypes (morphology
and F-actin) than T4-2 cells in 3D (Figure 8A). We
determined expression of ROCK in MDA-MB-231 cells
grown in 2D or 3D cultures. MDA-MB-231 cells grown
in 2D culture had high levels of both ROCK1 and ROCK2
proteins, which were comparable to those were observed
when T4-2 cells were grown in 3D lrECM (Figure 8B).
Next, we examined effects of ROCK inhibition on MDAMB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells treated with ROCK
inhibitor (Y-27632 and Fasudil, 30 µM) formed clusters
that phenotypically appeared less aggressive (Figure 9A)
[27]. Both ROCK inhibitors also decreased proliferation of
MDA-MB-231 cells in 3D IrECM (Figure 9B). However,
the inhibition of proliferation was less potent in MDAMB-231 cells compared to T4-2 cells. Inhibition of ROCK
in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced the phosphorylation level
of MLC as well as the expression of Integrinβ1, GLUT3,
ROCK and RhoA proteins (Figure 9C). Inhibition of

If breast cancer cells dissolve ECM components and
spread into distant tissues such as lung and bone marrow,
they manage to survive and grow under microenvironment
containing fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells and other
type of cells [8]. We implemented co-culture of T4-2 cells
with fibroblasts using IrECM, and examined effects of
ROCK inhibition on T4-2 cells in this co-culture system.
Whereas the starved medium without fibroblasts was not
enough for growth of T4-2 cells, T4-2 cells were able to
grow in the presence of cultured lung fibroblasts (Figure
7A). Inhibition of ROCK (Y-27632, 30 µM) and EGFR
inhibitor (AG1478, 0.1 µM) reduced proliferation in
co-cultured T4-2 cells (Figure 7B) while these reagents
did not kill lung fibroblasts (data not shown).These
observations suggested that ROCK inhibitor may be
beneficial for prevention of metastasis.

Elevated levels of ROCK correlate with the
disorganized phenotype in triple negative MDAMB-231

reduction of disorganized actin-stress fibers, and restored
basal polarity (Figure 9D).
We further addressed whether inhibition of
ROCK downstream molecule involved in actomyosin
contractibility could alter properties of both T4-2
and MDA-MB-231 cells to be less aggressive. The
morphological changes induced by Blebbistatin (20 µM),
a Myosin II ATPase inhibitor, were similar to those by
ROCK inhibitor (Figure S3A). Blebbistatin also inhibited
the proliferation (data not shown), restored the basal
polarity, and reduced the disorganized actin-stress fibers
in both cell lines (Figure S3B). These results suggest
increased actomyosin contractibility through activation of

cells. Together, our results suggest that increased ROCK
signaling plays a critical role in breast cancer progression.
Understanding the role of the ROCK signaling node will
be beneficial for the design of new and complementary
treatment strategies for breast cancer.

DISCUSSION
Several studies have shown that elevated expression
of RhoA and ROCK1 in breast cancer tissues is associated
with poor prognosis [9-13]. Similarly, higher expression
of RhoA, ROCK1 and ROCK2 has been found in other
types of cancer [36-40]. There are additional reports of
somatic mutations of ROCK1 which lead to uninterrupted
kinase activity due to the absence of auto-inhibition,
resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements in a number of
cancers including breast cancer [41, 42]. In this study, we
used physiologically relevant 3D cell culture to assess
the mechanism by which ROCK activity participates in
malignant progression. We show here that expression of
RhoA, ROCK1 and ROCK2 were higher in malignant
T4-2 cells compared to the counterpart nonmalignant S1
cells (Figure 1). These results are similar to observations
in clinical tissue samples [9-13], indicating that culture
of HMT-3522 breast cancer progression series in 3D
lrECM gels is a good model for studying the more
detailed mechanism(s) of how these pathways may
disrupt normal function. We show that phosphorylation of
MLC, a substrate of ROCK, was increased in T4-2 cells
(Figure 1). We previously showed that the cytoskeleton
is disorganized, and that there is high mRNA expression
of actin cytoskeleton genes in T4-2 cells in 3D lrECM
[22-25]. These results suggested activation of RhoA/
ROCK pathway in T4-2 cells. Inhibition of ROCK by
two different ROCK inhibitors improved the basal and
basolateral polarity (Figure 3B and 3C), and inhibited
proliferation (Figure 2B) of T4-2 cells. Moreover,
inhibition of ROCK led to down-regulation of EGFR
and Integrinβ1 signaling pathways [22, 23], and reduced
expression of GLUT3 and LDHA (Figure 2C and
Figure 5A), which are involved in aerobic glycolysis
[24]. Moreover, inhibition of ROCK suppressed the
proliferation in T4-2 cells co-cultured with lung fibroblasts
in IrECM (Figure 7). ROCK inhibition partially restored
basal polarity, inhibited cell proliferation and downregulated Integrinβ1 and GLUT3 in metastatic MDAMB-231 cells grown in 3D cultures of lrECM (Figure
9). These observations are consistent with those reported
where inhibition of ROCK suppresses tumor formation in
an orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model [16].
In contrast, nonmalignant cells were only slightly affected
by treatment with ROCK inhibitors (Figure S2) [43].
However, forced expression of active ROCK disrupted
polarity in nonmalignant cells (Figure 6). Hence, our
results indicate that improper regulation of RhoA/ROCK
signaling leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement plays an

Expression of E-cadherin renders MDA-MB-231
cells sensitive to ROCK inhibitors
MDA-MB-231 cells are different from T-4 cells in
that they lack E-cadherin (Figure 8B). We have previously
observed that presence and correct function of E-cadherin
is essential for the formation and maintenance of acinar
structures as the function-blocking antibody disrupts
polarity of S1 cells in 3D culture [34]. Furthermore, we
showed that exogenous expression of E-cadherin in MDAMB-231 cells allows the formation of compact clusters
and enhances responsiveness to several reverting agents
[26]. These results reinforce the evidence that E-cadherin
plays a critical role in epithelial architecture. We used
E-cadherin-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells to investigate
effects of ROCK inhibition on the phenotype of MDAMB-231 cells. Expression of ROCK protein was not
changed by overexpression of E-cadherin (Figure S4).
MDA-MB-231 infected with an empty vector showed
the stellate morphology (Figure 10A), and inhibition of
ROCK led to less disorganized phenotype (Figure 10A,
10C and 10D), which was similar to the results of parent
cells (Figure 9). In contrast, E-cadherin-expressing
(E-cad) MDA-MB-231 cells showed less stellate clusters
(Figure 10A). Inhibition of ROCK strongly decreased
proliferation of E-cad-MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 10B).
On the other hand, EGFR inhibitor (AG1478) barely
affected the proliferation of control-and E-cad-MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 10B), which is consistent with
previous observations of MDA-MB-231 cells lacking
proliferative response to EGF [35]. We found that E-cadMDA-MB-231 cells treated with ROCK inhibitor no
longer stained with phalloidin (Figure 10C), and appeared
to be dead (Figure 10A). Furthermore, a TUNEL assay
showed that fragmented DNA was increased by inhibition
of ROCK in E-cad-MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in vectorcontrol cells (Figure 10D), suggesting that inhibition of
ROCK induced apoptosis in the E-cad-MDA-MB-231

important role in regulation of growth and polarity in
cancer cells in 3D.
Culture of cells under physiologically relevant
3D conditions distinguishes the morphology between
nonmalignant (normal) cells and cancer cells, [1921]. Using this culture system, we found expression of
ROCK1 and ROCK2 were high in malignant T4-2 cells
in 3D lrECM, but not in 2D cultures (Figure 1). We also
observed reciprocal interactions among ROCK, EGFR,
Integrinβ1 and aerobic glycolysis pathways (Figure 2C
and Figure 5). Importantly, the interaction was dependent
on the 3D context. Although ROCK inhibitors reduced
actin-stress fibers in T4-2 cells cultured in 2D, they
failed to down-regulate expression of EGFR, Integrinβ1
and GLUT3 proteins (Figure S1). This is consistent with
previous results from the laboratory where we found
that cross-modulation between EGFR and Integrinβ1
signaling pathways occurred only in 3D culture, but not
in 2D culture [23]. Moreover, a mouse skin tumor model
where cells expressed 4-hydroxytamoxifen-regulated
ROCK, which consists of ROCK kinase domain and
estrogen receptor under control of cytokeratin 14 promoter
[44], revealed a relationship between ROCK-induced
cytoskeletal rearrangement and tumor progression [44].
Phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated FAK and β-catenin
mislocalization were elevated in the ROCK-activated skin
tissues while ROCK inhibitor blocked the phosorylation.
Additionally, these studies showed that activation of
ROCK increased the tissue stiffness, accompanied by
ECM decomposition [44]. Similarity, our 3D culture
model showed that phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated
FAK (Figure 5B) and disorganized β-catenin localization
(Figure 3C) were increased in malignant T4-2 cells
compared to nonmalignant S1 cells. Inhibition of ROCK
reduced levels of phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated
FAK and disorganized β-catenin in T4-2 cells in 3D
lrECM (Figure 3C and 5B). Our studies further support
the use of physiological 3D culture as a platform to
understand the integrated signaling required to form
correct tissue polarity and what goes wrong during cancer
progression. Another group has developed 3D cultures for
glioblastoma using polyethylene-glycol-based hydrogel
to modulate matrix stiffness, and found that increasing
matrix stiffness induced upregulation of ROCK1 [45].
Therefore, it is worth investigating using other type of
cancer cells in 3D culture.
The detail mechanism of upregulation of ROCK
expression has not been fully elucidated in breast cancer.
ROCK1 and ROCK2 are ubiquitously expressed during
embryogenesis and in adult tissues [5, 6]. Comparatively,
ROCK1 is highly expressed in the lung, liver, spleen,
kidney and testis while ROCK2 is abundant in the brain
and heart [5, 6]. However, regulation of expression
of ROCK1 and ROCK2 is often abrogated in several
diseases [5, 6, 46], including several cancers [9, 11, 12,
36-40]. More recently, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has been shown to transcriptionally up-regulate RhoA
and ROCK1, not but ROCK2, in breast cancer cell lines
in response to hypoxia in 2D culture. In previous work
from the laboratory, it was observed that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of HIF-1α, HIF-2α or their combination
neither down-regulated EGFR and Integrinβ1 nor revert
the disorganized phenotype of T4-2 cells [24]. In the
current study, both ROCK1 and ROCK2 were increased
in 3D lrECM of T4-2 cells (Figure 1), despite the fact
that HIF is not involved. Thus, there is little possibility
of involvement of HIF in regulation of ROCK expression
in the 3D culture system and most probably even in vivo.
There are several reports to illustrate the decrease
in tumor suppressive microRNAs which directly regulate
expression of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in other type of cancers
[47-53]. We are now finding that several microRNAs were
decreased in T4-2 cells and MDA-MB-231 compared with
S1 cells, and their microRNAs were also decreased in
breast tumor tissues (submitted manuscript). It is likely
that microRNAs directly or indirectly regulate ROCK
mRNA expression in breast cancer in the similar fashion
as other types of cancers.
To confirm the commonality of ROCK inhibition in
attenuating the breast cancer phenotype, we show here that
inhibition of ROCK restored polarity, and down-regulated
the expression of Integrinβ1 and GLUT3 proteins in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9) as well as T4-2 cells. On
the other hand, ROCK inhibition had a much less effect
on MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231
as compared to T4-2 cells (Figure 9B). MDA-MB-231
cells have lower levels of EGFR in comparison to some
breast cancer cell lines (Figure 8B) which leads to the
ineffectiveness of EGFR inhibitors (Figure 8B) and EGFR
function blocking antibody as shown previously [26].
This is because cell growth of MDA-MB-231 is driven
by mutated K-RAS (G13D) rather than by EGFR [5456]. MDA-MB-231 cells have a large amount of ROCK1
and ROCK2, regardless of 2D or 3D culture condition
(Figure 8B). Furthermore, a major difference between
MDA-MB-231 and T4-2 cells is that MDA-MB-231 lacks
E-cadherin (Figure 8B). Thus, these differences most
likely account for the modest inhibition in proliferation by
the ROCK inhibitor on MDA-MB-231 cells.
Another faulty signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231
cells is the lack of functional E-cadherin and the loss
of E-cadherin in cells is associated with epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), accompanied by the
potential of drug resistance in cancer treatment [57, 58].
ROCK inhibition decreased proliferation, and enhanced
apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing
E-cadherin (Figure 10D). Thus, one explanation is that
inhibition of EMT by overexpression of E-cadherin
might contribute to enhancement of responsiveness to
ROCK inhibitor. It has recently been shown that ROCK1
is associated with E-cadherin complexes through p120catenin [59]. Our above observations also indicate
31616

Oncotarget

that there is a close relationship between ROCK and
E-cadherin.
Inhibition of ROCK leading to apoptosis is unclear
and there have been reports that ROCK positively
or negatively regulates apoptosis. Capase-2/3 and
granzyme B cleave ROCK1 and ROCK2, respectively,
at C-terminal region of the protein during apoptosis [6062]. In consequence, each ROCK is activated, leading to
apoptotic membrane blebbing [60-62]. The other apoptotic
biochemical reactions such as condensation of chromatin
and inactivation of mitochondrial enzymes are independent
of membrane blebbing via ROCK [63]. On the other hand,
inhibition of ROCK induces apoptosis in several types of
cancer cell lines [64, 65], and enhances cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in lung cancer line [66]. Combined therapy of
both inhibition of ROCK by Fasudil and the proteasome
complex by bortezomib induces apoptosis, and drastically
reduces lung tumor burden in a genetic engineered mouse
model harboring KRAS mutation without adverse side
effects [67]. We observed here that induction of apoptosis
by inhibition of ROCK took place in MDA-MB-231 cells
overexpressing E-cadherin, not but in T4-2 cells, S1 cells
or MDA-MB-231 vector control cells. Therefore, the role
of ROCK in a pro-apoptotic process might depend on a
cell type or intracellular context. The precise mechanism
of inhibition of ROCK leading to apoptosis requires
further investigation. .
In conclusion, our findings indicate that
RhoA/ROCK signaling, which leads to cytoskeletal
rearrangement, plays an important role in the phenotype
of breast cancer cells and the disrupted tissue architecture
in breast cancer. Therapy based on targeting the ROCK
signaling cascade or combinational therapy with
inhibitors/blocking antibodies against other pathways
might provide a therapeutic opportunity for breast cancer.
