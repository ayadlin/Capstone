Abstract:

The recent observation that targeted elimination of a minor subpopulation of
melanoma cells can lastingly eradicate the tumor lesion provides strong evidence
that an established melanoma lesion is hierarchically organized and maintained by
definite subset of cells but not by every random cancer cell. This review discusses
the concepts of discrete cancer stem cells and of a cellular hierarchy in melanomas,
the rationale for shifting therapies from broad tumor cell cytotoxicity into selective
cancer cell elimination strategies and the challenges for future therapeutic concepts.

Introduction

based on xeno-transplantation combined with clinical
observations fueled the cancer stem cell (CSC) model with
the central paradigm that tumor initiation and progression
is driven by a minor subset of discrete CSCs which have
the capacity to renew themselves and to establish tumors
upon transplantation, to stay quiescent (“dormant”)
for long time, to be more resistant to chemotherapy
and radiation, and to drift to distant sites of the body to
initiate metastases. In this context, the CSC paradigm
describes several phenomena in tumor biology which
have been clinically observed but are poorly understood.
For instance, metastatic relapse of melanoma can occur
more than a decade after curative surgical treatment of
the primary lesion; this phenomenon is thought to be due
to the same cancer-originating cell, which drives cancer
progression and relapse [3].
Recent data from our group [4] provide strong
evidence that a minor subset of melanoma cells drives
melanoma progression. Targeting CD20-positive
melanoma cells, which constitute as little as 0.1 - 2% of
the cancer cell population, can completely and lastingly
eradicate the disease in mice without the need to target
the tumor cell mass. In this review we discuss some
consequences and challenges for the understanding of
melanoma biology and for the future design of therapeutic
regimes.

Current regimens in cancer therapy attempt to
eradicate all the malignant cells in a tumor lesion; this is
based on the assumption that each cancer cell has equal
malignant capacities. However, it has long been known
that tumor lesions display an enormous histological
heterogeneity; the tumor cell mass of most malignant
lesions consists of a variety of cancer cells with different
proliferative capacities, some of which are still present
in a postmitotic stage. Genetic differences and increasing
genetic instabilities are thought to drive such phenotypic
heterogeneity; this results in a variety of different
cell clones, which populate the tumor cell mass. The
accumulation of oncogenic and tumor repressor gene
mutations in an increasing number of cancer cells during
tumor progression points toward a multi-hit process
which drives the clonal evolution of malignant cell clones
by stepwise acquisition of mutations, as formulated by
Fearon and Vogelstein (1990) [1] for colon cancer. An
overwhelming body of evidence, which was collected in
the following years, strongly supports the clonal evolution
model in tumor progression. Recent advances in global
genome sequencing confirmed the presence of genetic
heterogeneity in primary tumors and identified driver
mutations in metastasis in addition to common mutations
[2].
A variable but low number of cells isolated from
solid tumor lesions can initiate tumors of the same
histological heterogeneity as the parental tumor. Data

8]. Subsequently, tumor-inducing cells were identified
in solid tumors including the mammary carcinoma. Cells
with CD44+ CD24-/low phenotype induced tumors upon
transplantation, whereas the majority of cancer cells
from the same lesion did not [9]. The induced tumors
displayed the same histology as the parental tumor and
harbored tumorigenic cells, which again induced tumors
upon serial transplantation. Since no clear morphological
or phenotypical genotype can be attributed to them,
CSCs are functionally identified by their ability to induce
tumors upon transplantation into mice with different
grades in immune deficiency by limiting dilution, most
rigorously by transplantation of a single cell (for review
[10, 11]). The induction of progressively growing tumors
which recapitulates the parental tumor in its cellular
heterogeneity reflects self-renewal of CSCs and their
ability to differentiate. Long-term self-renewal has been
confirmed by serial transplantation of re-isolated CSCs,
which gives rise to secondary tumors. However, the
conclusions drawn thereon are based on some premises
which led to controversial conclusions in the definition of
CSCs in general and in melanomas in particular [12-16].
One reason for the controversial discussion is
the existence of major differences in the experimental
context. At least the assay duration, the degree of immune
deficiency, and the environment into which melanoma
cells are transplanted are critical parameters, which
substantially impact on the outcome of the assay. A recent
study by Weissman and colleagues calculated a frequency
of tumorigenic cells in any melanoma of about 1/2000
cells [17]. Although this study indicates that tumorinitiating potential is rare in melanomas, testing under
modified conditions revealed that approximately 1 out
of 6 (1/2 – 1/15) melanoma cells is capable of inducing
tumors [18]. In line with that, a high incidence of tumor
formation upon transplantation of single cells from BRAF
mutated, PTEN- melanomas was reported [19].
The use of the transplantation assay to identify
cancer stem cells has substantial limitations. First, human
cells have to overcome species barriers upon transfer
into the murine environment. At least for some solid
cancers, mouse tumor cells accordingly showed improved
engraftment when transplanted into fully compatible
hosts [20-23], whereas this was not the case for murine
leukemias [24-26]. Second, transplanted cells have to
reconstruct their own niche, which will be different
from the particular environment in an existing tumor
from which they were isolated. As a consequence, the
transplanted cell is more highly challenged for functional
flexibility upon transplantation than the same cell resident
in the tumor tissue. Therefore, the transplantation assay
does not address whether or not an established melanoma
is organized in a functional hierarchy with different cancer
cell subsets. Not every cell exhibiting tumorigenic potential
in the transplantation assay will contribute to melanoma
progression. Once the tumor tissue is established, the

Observations by Pierce and co-workers that
teratomas contain pluripotent stem cells led to the early
definition of CSCs [5, 6]. The concept was subsequently
sustained by deciphering the hierarchical organization
in hematological malignancies. In their landmark paper
Bonnet and Dick (1997) identified CSCs in most types
of acute myeloid leukemia by xeno-transplantation and
calculated their frequency to be approximately 10-6 [7,

Figure 1: The hierarchical and the transplantation
model may reflect different stages in melanoma
development. Transplantation assays indicate that isolated

melanoma cells with different phenotypes can initiate by
asymmetric cell divisions new tumor lesions when transplanted
under appropriate conditions. This provides evidence for a
variable, potentially high number of cancer cells with tumororiginating capabilities. Once established, targeted elimination of
a definite, non-random minor subset of melanoma cells results in
melanoma eradication, which provides evidence for a functional
hierarchy with a “master cell” required for maintaining the
melanoma lesion. Both models may reflect different stages in
melanoma development. Although the mass of cancer cells in an
established tumor lesion does not provide melanoma-maintaining
functions, functional plasticity enables individual cells to exhibit
melanoma-originating capabilities when isolated from the tumor
tissue and seeded under limiting dilution conditions. Once the
tumor tissue has become re-established, a few “master cells” take
over to maintain tumor integrity and to fuel progression.

tumor-initiating potential may be repressed by intrinsic
cellular mechanisms due to clonal evolution processes
or epigenetic changes; extrinsic mechanisms such as
metabolic insufficiencies or low oxygen may additionally
contribute to this. Recent data from our group support the
assumption that, once established, melanoma maintenance
depends on only a minority of melanoma cells. The latter
has to be eliminated in order to eradicate an established
tumor lesion [4].

cells were identified without isolation from tumor tissues
and transplantation into a xeno-environment. The effect
is specifically associated with the CD20+ melanoma cell
subset since elimination of any random 10% cancer cells
from the established tumor lesion is not effective. A caveat
is that obviously some melanomas, in our cohort 1 out
of 5 patients, do not harbor CD20+ melanoma cells. In
those melanoma lesions the cancer cell subset may not
exist or may lack CD20. However, CD20 itself does not
seem to be causally involved in the induction of tumorsustaining capacities since transgenic expression of CD20
in a random, CD20-negative melanoma cell population
and subsequent targeted elimination of those cells from an
established melanoma did not eradicate the tumor lesion.
Taken together the data provide the first direct evidence
that an established melanoma lesion is hierarchically
organized, i.e. harboring a minor subset of cancer
cells which is crucial in maintaining malignant tumor
growth. However, this observation raises the following
implications with substantial impact for the understanding
of melanoma biology.

A minor subset of melanoma
cells sustains tumor persistence
and growth
To date no direct evidence is available to show whether
maintenance and long-term progression of established
solid tumors is driven by all cancer cells or by a subset of
them. Using in vivo targeting of defined tumor cell subsets,
we recently demonstrated that selective elimination of a
definite, minor cancer cell subpopulation is particularly
effective in eradicating established melanoma lesions
irrespective of the tumor cell mass [4]. Human melanoma
lesions which recapitulate the histological heterogeneity
of the parental tumor were established in immunodeficient
mice by means of transplantation of unsorted biopsy cells.
Once the tumor was established, i.e. growing progressively
and connected to the host vasculature, pre-defined cancer
cell subsets in the tumor tissue were specifically targeted
by adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T cells, which were
redirected in an antigen-restricted manner by a chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR is composed of an
extracellular, antibody-derived binding domain and an
intracellular signaling domain derived from the T cell
receptor complex [27]. CAR-engineered T cells are thus
antibody-redirected and MHC-independently activated
to target cells which express the cognate antigen on
the cell surface. Engineering with a CAR specific for
high-molecular weight, melanoma-associated antigen
(HMW-MAA), also known as melanoma chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP), redirects cytolytic T cells
to selectively eliminate HMW-MAA+ cells; T cells with
a melanotransferrin (mtf) specific CAR eliminate mtf+
cells. Targeted elimination of melanoma cells with mtf
expression, which constitute nearly all malignant cells in
a melanoma lesion, eradicates the tumor lesion in immune
deficient mice. However, the same effect was induced by
targeted eradication of HMW-MAA+ cells, which make
up about 40% of the malignant cells in the lesion. It is
noteworthy that Melanoma lesions, were also eradicated
by targeted elimination of a 0.1 - 2% subset of cancer cells
which co-express CD20 together with HMW-MAA; no
relapse occurred in more than 36 weeks. The unexpected
observation is that elimination of the minor population of
CD20+ cancer cells is as effective in tumor eradication as
targeting the entirety of the cancer cells. In this context,
it is of substantial relevance that melanoma-sustaining

1. Do CD20+ melanoma cells exhibit capacities of
cancer stem cells?
The observation that continuous melanoma growth
requires the presence of a definite minor subset of cells
implies that those cells are capable of initiating new
melanoma lesions when transplanted into an immunedeficient host. Transplantation of enriched HMWMAA+ CD20+ melanoma cells into the immunodeficient
mouse confirmed their tumor-inducing capabilities.
Induced melanomas exhibited the same histological
morphology with low numbers of CD20+ cells as the
parental tumor; this is conserved in serial transplantation.
CD20+ melanoma cells thereby exhibit cancer stem cell
capabilitis. Similarly, Herlyn’s group previously reported
a tumorigenic potential in isolated CD20+ melanoma cells
which were grown in spheroids in vitro [28]. These cells
express melanoma-associated markers chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan (CSPG), β3 integrin and MCAM as well
as stem cell markers including CD133. These cells can
differentiate under appropriate conditions in vitro into
multiple cell lineages and exhibit self-renewal capacities
upon serial transplantation in vivo recapitulating the
cellular heterogeneity of the parental tumor. The data
are insufficient to determine whether these cells are the
only cells capable for renewal and tumor induction in
melanoma; other subsets of cells with the same stem cell
capability might possibly exist simultaneously in the same
tumor lesion.

2. Do CD20+ melanoma cells represent a stable
melanoma cell lineage or a transient phenotype
associated with cancer-maintaining capabilities?

3. How frequent are cells which maintain tumor
progression?
Based on the transplantation assay, the estimated
frequency of CSCs is commonly believed to be rare.
However, this may be greatly underestimated; this became
obvious when one out of ten murine leukemia cells
induced leukemia in compatible hosts [43] and one out
of four melanoma cells induced melanomas [18]. While
transplantation assays score for self-renewal and tumor
re-formation in a heterologous host, melanoma-sustaining
cells were identified by targeted elimination of defined
subsets of cancer cells [4]. The frequency of targeted
CD20+ melanoma cells in tumor tissues was about 2%
or less, whereas approximately 104 enriched HMWMAA+ CD20+ cells were required to induce melanomas
upon xeno-transplantation. However, CD20-negative
melanoma and other cancer types may harbor cancermaintaining cells in different frequencies. In concurrence
with others [11], we assume that the calculated frequency
of tumor inducing cells as estimated by the limiting
dilution transplantation assay is less relevant in the
context of melanoma-maintaining cells in an established
tumor lesion.

Markers, and combinations of markers, which are
used to isolate CSCs are currently chosen with respect to
their heterogeneous expression in tumor tissues and not
due to insight into a functional hierarchy of stem cells, for
instance, CD24 and CD44 in breast cancer [9] and pancreas
carcinoma [29], CD90 on hepatocellular carcinoma [30],
CD133 in colon, lung, brain tumors [31-35], and EpCam
in colorectal and pancreatic cancer [29, 36]. Expression
of CD271 [17], ABCB5 [37], CD133 [38], and CD20
[28] by melanoma CSCs has been reported. However, the
value of these and other markers in identifying CSCs has
been a matter of controversy since Quintana et al. (2010)
[39] showed a remarkable phenotypical plasticity of those
cells, i.e. sorted marker-positive and marker-negative cells
are similarly able to reconstitute a tumor with the same
pattern of marker expression as the parental tumor. In
particular, tumors which were initiated either by isolated
CD133+ or CD133- melanoma cells displayed the same
heterogenous pattern in CD133 expression as the parental
tumor [16, 18]. Moreover, melanoma cells expressing
the H3K4 demethylase JARID1B, which are more
tumorigenic than cells lacking JARID1B, can produce
cells which lack JARID1B; the latter, however, can also
produce JARID1B+ cells [40]. Similar observations were
reported by Sharma et al. (2010) [41], i.e. that individual
cells can transiently acquire or loose drug resistance
mediated by JARID1A. In this context, the expression
of certain markers by melanoma inducing cells may not
be heritably fixed but rather determined as a result of a
number of parameters provided by the environment.
Similarly, the CD20+ phenotype of an individual
melanoma cell in an established tumor lesion may not be
stable. Evidence for this is provided by tumors induced
by transplantation of isolated CD20+ melanoma cells.
Such tumors display a heterogeneous phenotype with
the majority of CD20- and a small subset of CD20+
melanoma cells [4, 28]. The underlying mechanism may
be phenotype-switching associated with asymmetric cell
division. The ability to switch phenotypes implies that
most cells in the tumor tissue will have the potential
to adopt a stem cell-like phenotype, independently of
whether cells exhibit a more differentiated postmitotic
or a more proliferative phenotype at a given moment
(for review [42]). Assuming that melanoma-maintaining
cells display their phenotype and functional capabilities
in a reversible fashion, eliminating cells in the functional
stage of tumor maintenance would only be sufficient to
eradicate the established melanoma lesion if reversion to
the stage of maintenance does not occur frequently.

4. Are CD20+ melanoma cells good targets for
therapy?
The data strongly imply that CD20+ melanoma cells
are appropriate targets for therapy. However, therapeutic
strategies have to deal with the particular properties of
those cells and of cancer stem cells in general. Depending
on their position in a functional hierarchy, targeting cancer
cell subsets will have different therapeutic effects. When
targeting a small subset of cancer cells, therapy may
initially be accompanied by a slow increase in tumor
progression until a decrease in tumor cell mass becomes
obvious. Mathematical modeling revealed that strategies
which eliminate tumor repopulating cells will be more
successful than increasing the death rate or decreasing
the production of mature tumor cells; the latter will not
succeed in eradicating progressing tumor lesions [44].
Based on these models, debulking tumor mass combined
with targeted elimination of CD20+ cells is assumed to
eradicate tumor lesions more rapidly while avoiding the
risk of relapse.
To specifically eliminate CD20+ melanoma cells,
Schmidt and colleagues (2011) [4] made use of genetically
engineered cytotoxic T cells, which are redirected by a
chimeric antigen receptor recognizing defined tumor cell
subsets in a MHC-independent fashion. Alternatively,
redirecting T cells by a recombinant T cell receptor in a
MHC-dependent manner will be feasible as soon as tumor
cells properly present the target antigen. Compared to
therapeutic drugs, redirected T cells have the advantage
316

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 313 - 320

that they actively penetrate tissues and scan cells for
specific ligands. Once activated, T cells lyse the cognate
cell, secrete a spectrum of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
proliferate, which in total results in a forced and prolonged
anti-tumor attack. Without contact to the antigen the T cell
response ceases, and the majority of T cells undergoes
apoptosis. Although some T cells are assumed to persist
in the long-term, thus providing CAR-defined antigenspecific memory, definite proof is still lacking.
Adoptive immunotherapy by engineered T cell is
still being explored in phase I trials, whereas therapeutic
antibodies have been in clinical use for the treatment of
malignant diseases for nearly a decade. In contrast to
chemotherapy, antibody treatment has the advantage that
it is not neutralized by a drug transporter or the dormant
stage of the target cell. However, successful treatment of
melanomas with anti-CD20 antibodies such as Rituxan
rituximab or Arzerra ofatumumab depends on several prerequisites: sensitivity of CD20+ melanoma cells to those
antibodies, which is assumed on the basis of B lymphoma
cell killing but not yet been demonstrated, efficient
penetration into solid tumor tissues to target the few
melanoma cells, and therapeutic antibody levels over time,
in particular when phenotype shifting plays a major role.
When systemically applied, the concomitant elimination
of B lymphocytes and the drop in immunoglobulin levels
has to be clinically addressed. An explorative phase I
melanoma study applying anti-CD20 antibody rituximab
as adjuvant for low-dose IL-2 has been reported [45];
however, the study did not determine any benefit in antitumor response. Currently, a phase I/II trial using antiCD20 antibody in the treatment of metastatic melanoma
is in planning [46]. As alternative to the therapeutic antiCD20 antibody, anti-CD20 radio-immunoconjugates
including ibritumomab, tiuxetan and tositumomab are also
worth testing. Recombinant single-chain antibodies may
be advantageous since they penetrate solid tissues more
efficiently than full length antibodies. When combined
with a T-cell-engaging domain, those recombinant bispecific antibodies are extremely effective in inducing an
anti-tumor cell response in circulation and solid tissues
[47].
CSCs in long-term proliferative quiescence
(“dormancy”) escape anti-proliferative chemotherapy,
which allows tumor relapse even after decades. This was
observed in the treatment of CML with imatinib; even
complete responses to treatment frequently relapse after
discontinuation of treatment. Successful therapy by antiproliferative drugs therefore has to induce cell cycle entry
of CSCs thus making them more sensitive, as recently
shown for AML [48]. Moreover, the therapeutic effect
of anti-proliferative drugs will be counteracted by the
pronounced expression of the chemo-resistance mediator
ABCB5 in melanoma CSCs [37]. In general, CSCs
are thought to be more resistant to chemotherapy and
radiation than the bulk of the tumor cells. This observation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is supported by pre-clinical data on CD44+CD24low
mammary carcinoma CSCs and clinical observations that
CSCs remained present and increased in relative numbers
in neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas cells without
CSC markers regressed [49, 50]. In the context of CD20+
melanoma maintaining cells, it will be of particular
interest to determine whether the frequency of those
cells during chemotherapy correlates with the clinical
outcome irrespective of the tumor cell mass. Furthermore,
long-term proliferative quiescence of CD20+ melanoma
cells may counteract clonal evolution of genetic and
epigenetic modifications, which continuously occurs and
affects different tumor cell subsets in established lesions
[51]. Genetic changes may drive resistance to therapy
and counteract long-term success; this becomes obvious
when mutant BRAF cells change from sensitive to more
malignant cells upon treatment with BRAF inhibitors
[52]. However, the question of whether or not CD20+
melanoma cells undergo substantial clonal evolution
during tumor progression needs to be addressed.
If functional and phenotypic plasticity occurs in
substantial frequencies in CD20+ melanoma cells, the
therapeutic targeting of those cells will require an ongoing
process and will only be successful in small tumor lesions
where the stochastic frequency of newly reverted cells
is low. If, after initial treatment, tumor growth relapses
in any surviving melanoma cell due to its functional
plasticity, eradication of tumor lesions will require the
elimination of all melanoma cells and in the long-term will
not be possible by targeting of any tumor cell subset at a
given time. Conversely, if melanoma growth depends on a
fixed tumor cell subpopulation, their specific elimination
will effectively eradicate tumor lesions without targeting
the bulk of the tumor cells. In their therapeutic approach
Schmidt et al. (2011) [4] treated melanoma lesions
of about 15  -  20 mm3 in volume, which are fairly well
established, have their own stroma and are vascularized,
but which represent smaller tumor volumes than human
bulk metastases. Moreover, Schmidt and colleagues took
advantage of the particular capability of cytolytic T cells
to patrol as a guardian through tissues and to eliminate
those cells whenever they occur. Targeting the same cells
by therapeutic antibodies would require maintenance
of therapeutic levels in the long-term; however, this is
clinically feasible.

Conclusions
Strong evidence for a functional hierarchy in a
melanoma lesion is provided by tumor eradication by
means of targeted elimination of the minor subset of
CD20+ melanoma cells. Although isolated individual
cancer cells can exhibit “stem-like” capacities under
limiting dilution conditions, rare melanoma cells seem
to trigger a hierarchy in an established melanoma lesion
by maintaining tumor integrity and progression via
317

processes which are currently unknown. Functional and
phenotypic plasticity as well as accumulating genetic
lesions may result in the situation that the melanomamaintaining property is not genetically fixed to a certain
cell; other master cells which fuel melanoma integrity and
progression may exist, in particular in those cases which
lack CD20+ melanoma cells.
At least three substantial consequences for prognosis
and therapy need to be addressed:
First, whether functional plasticity counteracts the
therapeutic efficacy of targeted elimination of CD20+
melanoma cells in the clinical situation.
Second, whether the frequency of CD20+ melanoma
cells serves as a surrogate for therapeutic efficacy and is
of prognostic value.
Third, whether “dormant” CD20+ melanoma cells
initiate melanoma relapse even after decades.
