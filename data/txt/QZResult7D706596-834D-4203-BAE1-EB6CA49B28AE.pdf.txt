Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an anti-apoptotic
member of the Bcl-2 family that is elevated in a variety of
tumour types including breast cancer. In breast tumours,
increased Mcl-1 expression correlates with high tumour
grade and poor patient survival. We have previously
demonstrated that Her-2 levels correspond to increased
Mcl-1 expression in breast tumours. Epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor signalling is frequently deregulated
in breast cancer and leads to increased proliferation and
survival. Herein, we determined the critical downstream
signals responsible for the EGF mediated increase of
Mcl-1 and their role in cell survival. We found that both
Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels are rapidly induced upon
stimulation with EGF. Promoter analysis revealed that an
Elk-1 transcription factor-binding site is critical for EGF
activation of the Mcl-1 promoter. Furthermore, we found
that knockdown of Elk-1or inhibition of the Erk signalling
pathway was sufﬁcient to block EGF upregulation of
Mcl-1 and EGF mediated cell survival. Using chromatin
immunoprecipitation and biotin labelled probes of the
Mcl-1 promoter, we found that Elk-1 and serum response
factor are bound to the promoter after EGF stimulation.
To determine whether Mcl-1 confers a survival advantage,
we found that knockdown of Mcl-1 expression increased
apoptosis whereas overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited drug
induced cell death. In human breast tumours, we found a
correlation between phosphorylated Elk-1 and Mcl-1
protein levels. These results indicate that the EGF induced
activation of Elk-1 is an important mediator of Mcl-1
expression and cell survival and therefore a potential
therapeutic target in breast cancer.

Introduction
Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an anti-apoptotic
member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that has a critical
role in regulating the balance between survival and
death signals (Yip and Reed, 2008). Anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members are frequently deregulated in human
cancers and Mcl-1 is elevated in a variety of tumour
types (Backus et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2002; Song et al.,
2005) including breast cancer, where it has been found
to correlate with poor prognosis (Ding et al., 2007).
Small molecule inhibitors targeting pro-survival Bcl-2
family members are currently in clinical trials (Vogler
et al., 2009); however, due to inherent low afﬁnities for
Mcl-1, Mcl-1 overexpression was frequently found to
mediate resistance (Oltersdorf et al., 2005; van Delft
et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2007; Tse et al., 2008). More
recently developed small molecule inhibitors that have a
higher ability to disrupt Mcl-1 function have overcome
resistance to other pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitors (Nguyen
et al., 2007). This demonstrates the importance of Mcl-1
in the regulation of apoptosis.
The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family is
composed of four key membrane spanning receptors
referred to as ErbB1-4 (Her-1-4). Of these receptors,
ErbB1 (Her-1) and ErbB2 (Her-2) are most frequently
overexpressed in human cancers (Klapper et al., 2000).
In breast cancer, ErbB2 (Her-2) is overexpressed in
roughly 20% of cases and correlates with poor prognosis (Singleton and Strickler 1992; Nanda 2007). Mcl-1
has previously been described in the literature as a
downstream target of the EGF signalling pathway in
oesophageal (Leu et al., 2000), colorectal (SchulzeBergkamen et al., 2008) and lung (Song et al., 2005)
cancer cell lines. We have evidence that suggests a
similar response is seen in breast cancer and have found
a correlation between Her-2 positive breast cancers and
high levels of Mcl-1 expression (Henson et al., 2006).
Although one report has demonstrated a correlation
between phosphorylated Stat-3 and elevated Mcl-1 in
breast tumours (Hsieh et al., 2005), the transcriptional
mechanisms governing Mcl-1 expression in breast
cancer have not been thoroughly investigated.
A number of studies exist describing the transcriptional regulation of the Mcl-1 gene in a diverse set of cell
types. The Mek/Erk pathway has been implicated to

govern Mcl-1 transcription in several cell line models
(Boucher et al., 2000; Leu et al., 2000; Schubert and
Duronio 2001). Two independent studies have demonstrated that Elk-1 and serum response factor (SRF),
downstream of Erk activation, contribute to basal Mcl-1
expression levels as well as induction of transcription by
treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in
HEK 293, HeLa and Ml-1 cell lines (Townsend et al.,
1999; Vickers et al., 2004). In other cell types, the PI3K/
AKT pathway has been described as critical for Mcl-1
regulation (Wang et al., 1999; Kuo et al., 2001; Longo
et al., 2008). Additionally, the transcription factor Stat-3
has been tied to Mcl-1 expression in cells of hematopoietic origin (Puthier et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2003). The
precise signalling and transcriptional mechanisms regulating Mcl-1 in breast cancer cells remains unclear.
Herein, we determined that Erk activation of the
transcription factor Elk-1 is critical for transcriptional
regulation of Mcl-1 following EGF treatment and also
has a signiﬁcant role in EGF mediated cell survival in
breast cancer.

Figure 1a, both MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells demonstrated a marked elevation of Mcl-1 protein levels within
2 h of treatment and protein levels remained elevated
after 8 h of treatment. As Mcl-1 has a short half-life
(Akgul et al., 2000), rapid ﬂuctuations in protein levels
can occur in the absence of a change in relative
transcription of the Mcl-1 gene. Therefore it was
necessary to determine whether the observed changes
were a result of elevated transcription or modiﬁcation of
protein stability. Mcl-1 mRNA levels were detected over
a 120 min time course following stimulation with EGF
by semi-quantitative real-time PCR. After 30 min of
EGF treatment, the Mcl-1 mRNA level was increased
by fourfold in MCF-7 cells and at 60 min EGF
treatment in SK-BR-3 cells the mRNA level had
increased nearly threefold. The mRNA levels peaked
after 90 min of EGF stimulation at a 12-fold increase in
MCF-7 cells and fourfold increase in SK-BR-3 cells.
Control treated cells failed to demonstrate an increase in
Mcl-1 mRNA levels over the same time course (dashed
line, Figure 1b). This strongly suggests that EGF
signalling elevates transcription of the Mcl-1 gene in
breast cancer cells.

Results
Stimulation of the EGF signalling pathway upregulates
Mcl-1 protein and mRNA levels
Several studies have suggested that EGF signalling
regulates transcription of Mcl-1 (Leu et al., 2000; Cetin
et al., 2010). We have previously found a correlation
between elevated Her-2 and Mcl-1 levels in breast
tumours (Henson et al., 2006). To further assess whether
Mcl-1 expression is modiﬁed by EGF receptor activation in breast cancer, we studied Mcl-1 protein and
mRNA levels in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer
cell lines following treatment with EGF. As shown in

A small region of the Mcl-1 promoter containing a serum
response element is necessary for EGF induced
transcription
We set out to identify the key regulatory elements
necessary for EGF induced transcription of Mcl-1 in a
breast cancer cell line model. To determine the critical
region of the Mcl-1 promoter, a 3974 bp fragment
upstream of the translation start site was ampliﬁed by
PCR and cloned into the PGL-3 luciferase reporter
vector. A series of deletion mutants were generated to
narrow down the region of interest. A small segment of

the promoter, B300 bp upstream of the translation start
site, was found to be sufﬁcient for both basal and EGF
induced expression of the luciferase reporter in MCF-7
cells (Figure 2a). Sequence alignment of the human and
mouse Mcl-1 promoters showed a region of high
identity within this fragment (Figure 2b). A series of
7 bp deletions were created within the 4 kb promoter
reporter construct to identify potentially important cisacting DNA elements. Speciﬁcally, high scoring putative
transcription factor binding sites and the region of high
identity with the mouse Mcl-1 promoter were targeted
for deletion (Figure 2b). Transcription factor binding
sites were identiﬁed using the TFSearch software
(Heinemeyer et al., 1998). We found that deletion of
two regions corresponding to a potential Elk-1 binding
site (Del. 3) and SRF CarG box (Del. 6 and Del. 7)
reduced EGF activation of the Mcl-1 promoter
(Figure 2c). Both of these sites were within the region
of high identity between the human and mouse
promoters (Figure 2b). Additional transcription factor
binding sites including an ATF2 consensus site (Del. 1)

2369

and putative nuclear factor (NF)-kB binding sites (data
not shown) were deleted, but failed to signiﬁcantly alter
Mcl-1 promoter activity. The full-length Mcl-1 promoter (3974) was used as a positive control. Similar
results were obtained with SK-BR-3 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A and B).
Elk-1 is activated by stimulation with EGF and is essential
for control of Mcl-1 protein levels
The Mek/Erk pathway is activated by EGF and has
been shown to activate the transcription factor Elk-1
(Yordy and Muise-Helmericks, 2000). To determine
whether EGF stimulation resulted in activation of Erk1/
2 and Elk-1, MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells were treated
with EGF over a 60 min time course. As shown in
Figure 3a, Erk1/2 were phosphorylated within 5 min and
phosphorylation decreased after 60 min of EGF treatment. Following similar kinetics, phosphorylation of
Elk-1 at Ser383 was detected at 5 min following EGF
treatment and decreased by 60 min. After 60 min, an

increase in Mcl-1 protein was detected in MCF-7 cells.
Control treatment failed to induce phosphorylation of
these proteins over the same time course. Similar results
were observed in SK-BR-3 cells (Figure 3a). Pretreatment with U0126, a highly speciﬁc inhibitor of
Mek1/2 (Favata et al., 1998) prevented both Erk1/2 and
Elk-1 phosphorylation in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells.
This inhibition also prevented the elevation of Mcl-1
protein levels following EGF treatment (Figure 3b).
The Erk inhibitor 3-(2-aminoethyl)-5-((4-ethoxyphenyl)methylene)-2,4-thiazolidinedione, previously published
to prevent Elk-1 phosphorylation at Ser383 (Chen et al.,
2006), also produced similar results (Figure 6c).
Targeted knockdown of Elk-1 expression by transfection of a speciﬁc small interfering (si)RNA reduced
both basal and EGF induced Mcl-1 levels substantially
in both cell lines (Figure 3c). Knockdown of two
other transcription factors, Stat-3 and NF-kB, failed
to have an effect on basal or EGF induced levels of
Mcl-1 (Supplementary Figure 2A). Unexpectedly,
knockdown of SRF had no impact on basal or EGF
induced Mcl-1 protein or mRNA levels (Supplementary
Figure 2A/B). This data conﬁrms the importance of

Elk-1in transcriptional regulation of Mcl-1 in breast
cancer cells.
Elk-1 and SRF bind to the Mcl-1 promoter
To assess whether the transcription factors Elk-1 and
SRF bind to the Mcl-1 promoter, a chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment was performed
with MCF-7 cells using primers that amplify a 163 bp
region containing the putative Elk-1 and SRF binding
sites identiﬁed in Figure 2c. ChIP was performed with
Elk-1 and SRF antibodies along with two negative
antibody controls and a no antibody control (beads
alone). Elk-1 was detectable on the Mcl-1 promoter by
ChIP before stimulation with EGF (Figures 4a and b).
Under unstimulated conditions, SRF was only marginally detectable on the Mcl-1 promoter; however, within
10 min of adding EGF there was a signiﬁcant elevation
(85-fold enrichment) of SRF at the promoter, which was
maintained after 30 min of stimulation (Figures 4a
and b). This was followed by an elevation of Elk-1 at
the 20 and 30 min time points. Isotype controls (ctrl 1 is
an antibody against NF-kB, ctrl 2 is an antibody against

Figure 3 Elk-1 is activated by stimulation with EGF and is essential for control of Mcl-1 protein levels. (a) Cells were serum starved
for 24 h and then EGF was added to the cell culture media at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for a 60 min time course. An equal volume of
the EGF solvent was used as a control. Erk1/2 activation was assessed by antibodies speciﬁc for Erk1/2 only when dually
phosphorylated at Thr202 and Tyr204. Activation of Elk-1 was detected with an antibody speciﬁc to Elk-1 only when phosphorylated
at Ser383. Blots were re-probed for total Erk1/2 and Elk-1 to control for loading. Increase in Mcl-1 is shown for MCF-7 cells. (b) Cells
were pre-treated with the Mek inhibitor U0126 or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide for 20 min before stimulation with EGF.
Lysates were taken at 15 and 20 min post stimulation and blots were probed with the same antibodies as in (a). (c) In all 30 pmol
siRNA speciﬁc for Elk-1 or a scrambled control was transfected into SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells by nucleofection. Twenty-four hour
after transfection, the cells were starved for a subsequent 24 h followed by stimulation with EGF or control for 2 h.

Figure 4 The transcription factors Elk-1 and SRF bind to the Mcl-1 promoter in MCF-7 cells. (a) Chromatin immunoprecipitation
using antibodies speciﬁc to Elk-1 and SRF was performed as described in Material and methods section. Controls shown are two
negative antibody controls as well as a no antibody control (protein G beads alone). Ctrl1 is an antibody against Stat-3 and Ctrl 2 is an
antibody against NF-kB. Fold enrichment values were obtained by comparing the cT values for each ChIP sample to an equal amount
of input DNA. Primers were designed in the last exon of the Mcl-1 gene to demonstrate speciﬁcity (RT–PCR data not shown, PCR
products shown in (b)). Data represents the mean of three independent experiments±standard error. (b) PCR products were run on an
agarose gel following each ChIP experiment to assess reaction speciﬁcity. (c) Streptavidin pull-down assay to detect transcription factor
binding to a 50 bp double-stranded biotin labelled probe speciﬁc to the Mcl-1 promoter region of interest. Cells were stimulated with
EGF for different time periods and nuclear extracts incubated with the Mcl-1 probe. Following pull down with streptavidin beads, the
bound proteins were detected by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. To control for speciﬁcity, a biotinlabelled scrambled probe was used along with competition with an unlabelled speciﬁc probe. Blots were probed with antibodies to the
transcription factors Stat-3 and NF-kB to demonstrate binding speciﬁcity. (d) Schematic representation of the Mcl-1 gene showing

Stat-3) failed to immunoprecipitate Mcl-1 promoter
fragments and demonstrated fold enrichment values
close to zero (Figures 4a and b). All of the antibodies
failed to enrich a region of the third exon of the Mcl-1
gene (Figure 4b).
Further validation that Elk-1 and SRF bind to the
region of interest was obtained by performing a
streptavidin pull-down assay using a biotin-labelled
50 bp probe complementary to the region of interest
(155–205 bp upstream of translation start). The Mcl-1
promoter speciﬁc probe was able to pull down both Elk1 and SRF from EGF treated nuclear lysates
(Figure 4c). The scrambled probe did not demonstrate
observable binding and the presence of an excess of
unlabelled probe successfully competed away the signal
for both Elk-1 and SRF. Binding speciﬁcity was
determined by using antibodies against two other
transcription factors, NF-kB and Stat-3 (Figure 4c).
The decrease in SRF binding observed following
stimulation in the pull-down assay may be due to

increased recruitment of SRF to the chromatin and
therefore reduced availability of the protein in the assay.
Both EGF treatment and modulation of Mcl-1 expression
impact the survival of SK-BR-3 cells
It has been established that EGF receptor activation
elevates survival and resistance to apoptosis (Klapper
et al., 2000). In Figure 5a, we conﬁrmed that treatment
of SK-BR-3 cells with EGF signiﬁcantly reduced the
levels of apoptosis induced by both etoposide and
doxorubicin treatment. Protection was most evident at
low drug concentrations wherein EGF reduced 5 mM
etoposide induced cell death from 42 to 21% and 0.5 mM
doxorubicin induced cell death from 32 to 12%. To
assess the contribution of Mcl-1 to the survival of breast
cancer cells we performed a targeted knockdown
experiment with Mcl-1 speciﬁc small interfering (si)RNA. Twenty-four hours following siRNA transfection
there was a substantially higher number of apoptotic

control cells, * indicates Po0.05 comparing etoposide treated cells.) Please note the Mcl-1 expression levels following overexpression

cells (38%) with Mcl-1 knockdown as compared with
untreated cells (9%) or transfection with a scrambled
control siRNA (12%, Figure 5b). This implies that a
minimal level of Mcl-1 expression is critical for cell
survival in breast cancer cell lines. Overexpression of
Mcl-1 by transfection of the Mcl-1 complementary
DNA resulted in resistance to transfection toxicity
(25%) and etoposide (45%) induced cell death as
compared with the empty vector (40 and 55%,
respectively, Figure 4c). These results demonstrate that
Mcl-1 has an important role in cell survival.
EGF protects breast cancer cells from apoptosis through
a mechanism that relies on signalling via the Mek/Erk
pathway
As Mcl-1 knockdown alone was sufﬁcient to induce
apoptosis, we determined whether prevention of Mcl-1
upregulation would reverse the protective effects conferred by EGF pre-treatment. The Mek inhibitor U0126
completely prevents EGF induced upregulation of
Mcl-1 protein levels (Figure 6a) and also results in a
signiﬁcant reduction of the protective effect of EGF
(Figure 6b). In both the control and U0126 treated cells,
etoposide induced nearly identical levels of apoptosis
(39.4% in control and 41.4% in the U0126 pre-treated
cells). Pre-treatment with EGF resulted in a reduction in
the amount of apoptosis induced by etoposide from 39
Oncogene

to 19%. When the cells were also pre-treated with
U0126 the EGF treatment only resulted in a reduction
from 41 to 31% (Figure 6b).
To verify the result with U0126, the experiment was
repeated using an Erk1/2 inhibitor (Figures 6c and d).
The Erk1/2 inhibitor alone displayed slight toxicity that
appeared to be enhanced in the presence of EGF.
Despite the toxicity of the inhibitor, levels of apoptosis
induced by etoposide were only 5% higher with the
inhibitor as compared with that of the control (28.7
and 33.6%). Although EGF protection in the control
samples was similar to that observed in Figure 6b
(reduction from 28.7 to 12.8%), Erk inhibition completely reversed the protective effect conferred by EGF
pre-treatment. In stark contrast to the control samples,
co-treatment of etoposide with EGF in the presence of
the Erk inhibitor showed higher levels of apoptosis
compare with etoposide alone. These results indicate
that Mek/Erk signalling leads to increased Mcl-1
expression and has a critical role in the EGF survival
response in breast cancer cells.

relevant breast tumours the signiﬁcance of these results
will be diminished. To that end, we sought to determine
if the signalling pathways regulating Mcl-1 expression in
the MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cell lines are correlated to
Mcl-1 expression in human breast tumour samples.
Before proceeding to a large-scale analysis, a pilot study
was performed with 26 breast tumour samples from the
Manitoba Breast Tumour Bank. Tumour sections were
stained for immunoﬂuorescence with antibodies directed
against Mcl-1 and phosphorylated Elk-1. Antibodies
were pre-validated for immunoﬂuorescence on tumour
sections by overexpression and knockdown experiments
in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure 3A and B). A
panel of 26 breast tumour sections were stained with
antibodies against Mcl-1 and phospho-Elk-1 and scored
using a 0–3 point scoring system. In Supplementary
Figure 4A, the data was analysed by plotting the scores
as an XY scatter and performing a Spearman correlation test. We found a statistically signiﬁcant positive
correlation between phosphorylation of Elk-1 and Mcl-1
expression (rS ¼ 0.4303, P ¼ 0.0282) in the tested breast
tumours. Representative images from the sampled
tumours shown in Supplementary Figure 4b demonstrate that regions within an individual tissue section
having high phospho-Elk-1 (green signal), also demonstrate strong staining for Mcl-1 (red signal). Conversely,
regions with low phospho-Elk-1 levels tended to have
corresponding low levels of Mcl-1.
Based upon the pilot study, we further investigated
the relationship between activated Elk-1 and the
expression level of Mcl-1 in a tissue microarray
(TMA) provided by the Manitoba Breast Tumour
Bank. The TMA consisted of 255 tumours that were

previously assessed as ERa negative by a ligand binding
assay. Each tumour was represented by two separate
spots on the TMA. TMAs were immunostained with the
Mcl-1 and phospho-Elk-1 antibodies previously demonstrated to be effective for immunoﬂuorescence as well as
antibodies directed against phospho-Erk1/2, ErbB1 and
ErbB2. In Figures 7a and b, the tumours were separated
into two groups based on the median Mcl-1 H-score of
120. Tumours with a Mcl-1 score of 120 or less were
classiﬁed as ‘low Mcl-1’ and those with a score above the
median were classiﬁed as ‘high Mcl-1’. A Mann–
Whitney test was performed to determine if the median
phospho-Elk-1 and phospho-Erk1/2 scores (indicated
by the solid horizontal line) were signiﬁcantly different
between the two groups. The median phospho-Elk-1
score for the low-Mcl-1 category was 75.0 and the
median score for the high Mcl-1 score was 140, a
difference that was statistically signiﬁcant (Po0.005).
The median phospho-Erk1/2 scores were also signiﬁcantly different with a score of 50.0 in the low-Mcl-1
subset and a score of 100.0 in the high subset. The
phospho-Erk1/2 scores were also separated into two
groups based on the median phospho-Elk-1 score. As
Elk-1 is a substrate for Erk1/2 it was hypothesized that
elevated levels of phospho-Erk1/2 would correlate with
elevated levels of phospho-Elk-1. A signiﬁcantly higher
phospho-Erk1/2 score (150.0) was observed in tumours
that demonstrated high levels of phospho-Elk-1 as
compared with those that did not (50.0). In a similar
manner the tumours were divided based on the median
scores for ErbB1 and ErbB2. Increased expression of

Tumours were assessed using the H-score method. An intensity score of 0–3 was multiplied by the percentage of tumour cells stained.
Bars for all graphs represent median scores for each category. P-values were calculated by Mann–Whitney test. (a) H-scores for
phospho-Elk-1 were separated into two groups based on the median Mcl-1 H-score of 120. (b) H-scores for phospho-Erk1/2 were
separated into two groups based on the median Mcl-1 H-score of 120. (c) H-scores for phospho-Erk1/2 were separated into two groups
based on the median phospho-Elk-1 H-score of 100. (d) H-scores for Mcl-1 were separated into two groups based on the median ErbB1
H-score of 85. (e) H-scores for Mcl-1 were separated into two groups based on the median ErbB2 H-score of 50.

regulation of Mcl-1 protein expression by EGF receptors through the Mek/Erk pathways mediated by Elk-1
activation within breast tumours.

Discussion
Mcl-1 is unique amongst the pro-survival Bcl-2 family
members in the degree to which its expression is tightly
regulated and the multiple levels at which this occurs
(Akgul 2009). Besides having its expression being
regulated at the transcriptional level, Mcl-1 also
contains a PEST domain that confers a very short
protein half-life due to degradation via the proteasome
pathway (Akgul et al., 2000). This property allows for
tight regulation of Mcl-1 and protein levels ﬂuctuate
rapidly in response to the changing extracellular
environment. Another degree of regulation exists via
alternative splicing to generate a smaller protein that is
Oncogene

an activator of apoptosis (Bingle et al., 2000). Mcl-1 is
also subjected to multiple post-translational modiﬁcations that include cleavage by caspases or enhancement
of stability through phosphorylation (Le Gouill et al.,
2004). Mcl-1 is further regulated by the mir-29b
microRNA (Mott et al., 2007). These studies indicate
that Mcl-1 is a dynamically regulated protein, and our
results demonstrate that transcriptional control is an
important aspect of Mcl-1 expression in breast cancer.
Overexpression or mutation of the EGF receptors is
seen in a variety of tumour types (Klapper et al., 2000).
In breast cancer, the EGF receptor ErbB2/Her-2 is
overexpressed in B20% of cases (Nanda 2007; Singleton and Strickler 1992). The ErbB1 receptor is also
increased in breast cancer but increased gene transcription rather than gene ampliﬁcation appears to be the
primary reason for overexpression (Chrysogelos and
Dickson, 1994). In contrast to normal tissue the
expression level of ErbB1 in breast cancer can be
increased by as much as 20-fold (Herbst, 2004).

Epidermal growth factor regulates Mcl-1 expression
EP Booy et al

2375

Although less studied, ErbB3 is also found to be
increased in 19–29% of breast cancer cases and this
increase, like that of ErbB1, is not primarily due to a
change in gene copy number (Sithanandam and
Anderson, 2008). Although the prognostic signiﬁcance
of ErbB3 in breast cancer is not as straightforward as
for Her-2, a general trend towards disease progression
and poorer outcome is reported (Sithanandam and
Anderson, 2008).
Therapeutics that target the EGF receptors ErbB1
and ErbB2 such as Herceptin and Lapatinib have
successful clinical applications in breast cancer (Johnston et al., 2006). Despite these advances, resistance to
treatments has been a recurring theme (Nahta and
Esteva, 2006). We have previously shown a correlation
between Her-2 overexpression and elevated Mcl-1
protein expression. We have also demonstrated that
Mcl-1 can contribute to cell survival and resistance
against Herceptin (Henson et al., 2006). In this study we
conﬁrmed the relationship between EGF signalling and
upregulation of Mcl-1 and identiﬁed that the Mek/Erk
signalling pathway, acting ultimately through activation
of Elk-1, is critical in regulating Mcl-1 expression in
breast cancer cells. We have also taken the results
obtained in breast cancer cell lines and used them to
make accurate predictions in breast tumour samples,
supporting the clinical relevance of the study. Furthermore, we have determined that Mek/Erk signalling is
essential for the survival advantage conferred by EGF in
our cell line models. Over activation of any of the
downstream components of this pathway could contribute to resistance to EGF receptor targeted therapies
through an upregulation of Mcl-1.
It has previously been established that Mcl-1 is
overexpressed in breast tumours and correlates with
poor prognosis (Ding et al., 2007). In this study, we have
demonstrated that Mcl-1 is a downstream target of
activated EGF receptor signalling and that overexpression of Mcl-1 confers resistance to drug induced
apoptosis. We have also demonstrated that a minimal
expression level of Mcl-1 is critical for survival of the
SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell line. This data indicate that
Mcl-1 may be an important target for breast cancer
treatment. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated
effectiveness of Bcl-2 family inhibitors against breast
cancer (Martin et al., 2009; Witters et al., 2007). The
Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 has shown effectiveness in
breast cancer cells alone or in combination with EGF
receptor inhibitors (Witters et al., 2007). ABT-737
resistant cells show increased Mcl-1 expression indicating that targeted Mcl-1 expression could be an effective
treatment (Nguyen et al., 2007; Vogler et al., 2009).
We have shown that the transcription factor Elk-1 is
an important regulator of Mcl-1 expression. This
supports studies describing Mcl-1 transcriptional regulation by tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in HEK
293, HeLa and Ml-1 cell lines (Boros et al., 2009;
Townsend et al., 1999; Vickers et al., 2004). Although
we were able to validate the importance of Elk-1 in
controlling Mcl-1 expression we found that knockdown
of SRF had little or no effect on basal or induced Mcl-1

expression (Supplementary Figure 2) Whether this is due
to insufﬁcient knockdown, recruitment of other coactivators in the absence of SRF or Elk-1 acting
independently is yet to be determined. Although many
additional transcription factor binding sites were found
within the Mcl-1 promoter such as Stat-3 and NF-kB,
two transcription factors that may have a role in Mcl-1
regulation in other cell types, it appears that these sites
are not critical for the EGF induced regulation of Mcl-1
in these breast cancer cell lines (Boucher et al., 2000;
Henson et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2003; Tsutsui et al., 2009).
Furthermore, knockdown of both Stat-3 and NF-kB
had no observable effect on basal or EGF induced Mcl1 protein levels (Supplementary Figure 2A). Taken
together, this suggests that activation of Elk-1 is critical
for upregulation of Mcl-1 expression at least in breast
cancer cells.
The Mek/Erk signalling pathway has an important
role in breast cancer progression (Sivaraman et al., 1997;
Mueller et al., 2000). Although Ras mutations are
infrequently observed in breast cancer, elevated activation of the protein is observed in a substantial
proportion of tumours (Sivaraman et al., 1997; von
Lintig et al., 2000). The basal-like subset of breast
tumours has been identiﬁed as particularly susceptible to
Mek inhibition (Mirzoeva et al., 2009). Furthermore,
the Mek inhibitor PD0325901 has been found to be
effective as a single agent as well as in combination with
inhibitors of PI3K in murine xenograft models of basallike breast cancer (Hoeﬂich et al., 2009). Recently, the
use of Mek inhibitors has demonstrated success in
overcoming resistance to the EGF receptor inhibitor
lapatinib (Sambade et al., 2009; Zoppoli et al., 2010).
Our results point to the possibility that inhibitors of the
Mek/Erk signalling cascade can be effective at blocking
the expression of Mcl-1 in breast cancer. Our data also
suggest that Mcl-1 is an important downstream mediator of the survival beneﬁts conferred by overactivation
of this signalling network. Inhibition of the transcription
factor Elk-1 could be a further approach to block the
overexpression of Mcl-1; however, small molecule
inhibitors to Elk-1 are currently unavailable. Nevertheless, alterations in the Mcl-1 transcriptional regulation could be a viable strategy to sensitize breast cancer
cells to EGF receptor inhibitors and Bcl-2 inhibitors.

Materials and methods

Western blotting
All whole-cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer (50 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% nonident P-40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with
protease inhibitors (Complete mini, Roche, Laval, QC,
Canada) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail 1 and 2, Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of protein
were resolved by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to polyvinyl diﬂuoride membranes. Membranes
were blocked in Tris buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20
(Tris-buffered saline Tween-20) and 5% skim milk powder.
Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 1C in 5%
milk Tris-buffered saline tween-20. Following incubation,
membranes were washed threefold in Tris-buffered saline
tween-20 and then incubated with the appropriate secondary
antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidise for 1 hour at
room temperature in 5% milk tris-buffered saline tween-20.
Proteins were visualized on Hyperﬁlm ECL by enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Piscataway NJ, USA).
RNA isolation and real-time (RT)–PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus mini
kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and RNA
concentrations were quantiﬁed by measurement of absorbance
at 260 nm with a spectraphotometer (SpectraMax M5,
Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, CA, USA). In all 100 ng total
RNA was used as template for the real-time PCR. One-step
RT–PCR was performed using the iScript One-step RT–PCR
kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and cycling and data
collection were performed on an iCycler thermal cycler
(Bio-Rad) using the supplied software (iCycler IQ ver 3.1,
Bio-Rad). The following primers speciﬁc to the Mcl-1 mRNA
were used: forward: 50 -GCCAAGGACACAAAGCCA
AT-30 , reverse: 50 -AACTCCACAAACCCATCCCA-30 . The
following primers speciﬁc to the housekeeping gene cyclophilin
were used to standardize results: forward: 50 -GCTGCGT
TCATTCCTTTG-30 , reverse: 50 -CTCCTGGGTCTCTGCT
TTG-30 . The following cycling conditions were used: 50 1C
for 10 min followed by 95 1C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 95 1C
for 10 s followed by 55 1C for 30 s (data collection step). Primer

speciﬁcity was conﬁrmed by visualizing DNA on an agarose
gel following PCR.
Mcl-1 promoter constructs and luciferase assays
The Mcl-1 promoter was ampliﬁed by PCR from a BAC clone
containing the appropriate region of chromosome 1 (RP1154A4, Invitrogen). Primers were designed to amplify the
50 promoter region (3974 bp downstream of the translation
start site), as well as to generate seven large deletions from the
50 end. Promoter fragments were cloned into the PGL3
luciferase reporter vector (Promega). A 7-bp deletions were
introduced into the 3974 bp fragment of the Mcl-1 promoter
using the Quikchange II site directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Stratagene, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). The reporter constructs were transfected into
MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells using GenePorter 2 transfection
reagent (Genlantis, San Diego, CA, USA) along with a
plasmid containing the b-galactosidase complementary DNA
to standardize results. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
the cells were serum starved for an additional 24 h and then
treated with EGF or vehicle control. After 6 h treatment, cells
were lysed in 200 ml reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and
luciferase activity was measured in 20 ml lysate on an LMAX
luminometer (Molecular devices) with 100 ml luciferase assay
substrate (Promega). The b-galactosidase activity was assessed
by combining 50 ml lysate with 50 ml 2X b-gal buffer (200 mM
sodium phosphate pH 7.3, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/ml ONPG) and measuring the absorbance
at 450 nm.
ChIP
ChIP was performed following EGF stimulation according a
previously published protocol (Spencer et al., 2003). Following
immunoprecipitation, and RNAse/proteinase K digestion of
samples, ChIP DNA was isolated using the QiaQuick PCR
puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and DNA
concentration was determined using the PicoGreen dsDNA
quantitation assay (Invitrogen). In all 0.1 ng ChIP DNA was
ampliﬁed by RT-PCR using primers speciﬁc to the Mcl-1
promoter (forward: 50 -TAGGTGCCGTGCGCAACCCT-30 ,
reverse: 50 -ACTGGAAGGAAGCGGAAGTGAGAA-30 ) or
the last exon of the Mcl-1 gene (forward: 50 -TGTTGCTGGA
GTAGGAGCTGGTTT-30 , reverse: 50 -GCCATAATCCTC
TTGCCACTTGCT-30 ). To obtain fold enrichment values,
the cT value of each ChIP sample was compared with the
cT value of 0.1 ng input DNA.
Streptavidin pull-down assay
To assess transcription factor binding to an Mcl-1 promoter
speciﬁc probe, a streptavidin pull-down assay was performed
with biotin labelled probes speciﬁc to the Mcl-1 speciﬁc
promoter. The probe sequence is as follows: 50 -CAACC
CTCCGGAAGCTGCCGCCCCTTTCCCCTTTTATGGGA
ATACTTTTT-30 . Following treatment with EGF for the
indicated times, nuclear extraction was performed on 20  106
cells per time point. Nuclear extracts were pre-cleared with
50 ml streptavidin agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 1C
with rotation. Following pre-clearance, a binding reaction was
prepared that contained 500 mg nuclear extract, 50 ng/ml poly
dI-dC, 1/5 volume 5  binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5,
250 mM KCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol) and 100 nM biotin labelled
probe. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room
temperature at which point 50 ml streptavidin-agarose beads
were added. Following a 30 min incubation, beads were spun
down at 3000 r.p.m. for 1 min and washed 3  5 min in
phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, beads were resuspended in 50 ml 2X SDS loading dye, boiled for 5 min and the

isolated proteins were separated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and western blot was performed to assess
transcription factor binding.
siRNA transfections
The siRNA transfections were carried out using the Nucleofector
(Amaxa, Walkersville, MD, USA) electroporation device according to the cell line speciﬁc protocols provided by the manufacturer. In all 30 pmol total siRNA was transfected per sample and
all experiments were performed 48 h following transfection. Prevalidated siRNA duplexes were obtained from Invitrogen. The
following siRNAs were used: Mcl-1—50 -GAAAGUAUCACA
GACGUUCUCGUAA-30 , Elk-1—50 -GCGGCCAGAAGUUC
GUCUACAAGUU-30 , SRF—50 GCUACACGACCUUCAGC

UAUCUU-30 , NF-kB—sequence unavailable: product #29410
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Assessment of apoptosis
Analysis of apoptosis was performed by quantiﬁcation of
the sub-G1 peak by ﬂow cytometry using a BD FACScalibur
ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada)
according to a previously published protocol (Riccardi and
Nicoletti, 2006).
Immunostaining of parafﬁn embedded tissue sections and tumour
microarrays
Tumour tissue sections were acquired from the Manitoba
Breast Tumour Bank. Immunoﬂuorescence was performed as

previously published (Henson et al., 2006). Antibodies were
validated by immunoﬂuorescence performed on cells grown on
coverslips with and without knockdown of the protein of
interest by siRNA. TMAs were acquired from the Manitoba
Breast Tumour Bank, operating under the approval of the
Faculty of Medicine, University of Manitoba, Research Ethics
Board (Watson et al., 1996). The details regarding TMA
preparation and the protocol for immunohistochemistry
staining and development has been described previously
(Skliris et al., 2008). TMAs were scored using the H-score
method by two blinded independent observers under the
supervision of a pathologist at CancerCare Manitoba.
