ABSTRACT:
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths
worldwide with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. One approach to improving
survival is the identification of biomarkers to detect early stage disease. In this study,
we investigated the potential of the stem cell and progenitor cell marker, Musashi1
(Msi1), as a diagnostic marker and potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.
Functional studies in A549 bronchioalveolar carcinoma and NCI-H520 squamous cell
carcinoma cells revealed that Msi1 was enriched in spheroid cultures of tumor cells
and in the CD133+ cell population. Downregulation of Msi1 by lentivirus-mediated
expression of an Msi1 shRNA reduced spheroid colony proliferation. Growth inhibition
was associated with reduced nuclear localization of β-catenin and inhibition of the
processing of intracellular Notch. In primary lung cancer, Msi1 protein expression was
elevated in 86% of 202 tissue microarray specimens, and Msi1 mRNA was increased
in 80% of 118 bronchoscopic biopsies, including metastatic disease, but was rarely
detected in adjacent normal lung tissue and in non-malignant diseased tissue. Msi1
was expressed in a diffuse pattern in most tumor subtypes, except in squamous cell
carcinomas, where it appeared in a focal pattern in 50% of specimens. Thus, Msi1 is
a sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for all lung cancer subtypes.

INTRODUCTION

be effectively treated due to the prevalence of rapidly
metastatic disease [2], and therefore, a key aspect of
improving survival is the diagnosis of early disease. Lung
cancer is often diagnosed by bronchoscopic biopsy, and
bronchial brushing and bronchial lavage have been used
as adjuncts to bronchoscopy for histological, cytological
[3] and molecular [4] analysis. With the advent of
genomics and personalized medicine, the diagnosis and

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide [1], and despite modern
diagnostic and therapeutic advances, the 5-year survival
rate following resection has improved only in patients
diagnosed with early stage disease. At present, only one
out of eight patients diagnosed with lung cancer can

treatment of lung cancer is expected to improve [5, 6].
Musashi1 (Msi1) is an RNA-binding protein that
was initially identified in Drosophila melanogaster by
its ability to regulate sensory organ development and
asymmetric cell division [7, 8]. In mammalian cells,
Msi1 regulates translation in stem and progenitor cell
populations of several tissues [8-10]. Msi1 is a member
of a family of more than 800 RNA-binding proteins that
regulate a multitude of processes associated with the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, and when
aberrantly expressed can lead to diseases such as cancer
[11]. Among the documented targets of Msi1-mediated
translational repression are Numb, a negative regulator
of Notch [12], p21Waf1, a negative regulator of cyclindependent kinases [13], poly(A) binding protein [14],
Doublecortin, a factor involved in neuronal migration
[15], Robo3, a protein that controls neural guidance [16]
and Apc, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling [17].

A genome-wide analysis of Msi1 targets revealed >60
additional mRNA targets, many of which were related
to cancer progression [18]. In malignant tissues, Msi1
is highly expressed in gastric [19], gallbladder [20],
colorectal [21], endometrial [22] and lung [23] cancer. In
breast cancer [24], increased Msi1 expression correlated
with metastatic disease and poor survival.
In addition to its usefulness as a cancer biomarker,
Msi1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target. This has
been suggested by lentivirus-mediated ‘knockdown’ (KD)
of Msi1 in breast cancer [24, 25] and medulloblastoma
cells [26], resulting in inhibition of proliferation and tumor
xenograft growth.
In the present study, we report that Msi1 KD in A549
and H520 lung cancer cells inhibited the proliferation of
the stem-like spheroid tumor cells that was associated with
inhibition of Notch and Wnt signaling. Analyses of lung
cancers indicated that Msi1 protein or RNA expression
served as a highly sensitive diagnostic marker in >80%
of >300 lung cancers irrespective of histological subtype.

RESULTS

[27-29], monolayer and spheroid cultures of A549 and
H520 cells were sorted for CD133 and Msi1 mRNA levels
determined. A representative CD133 profile for A549 cells
indicated that CD133+ cells comprised 2.4% of the cells
grown spheroids and 1% of the cell grown as monolayers
(Figure 1E). Analysis of Msi1 RNA levels in CD133+ and
CD133- A549 and H520 spheroid cultures indicated that
CD133+ cells were enriched for Msi1 mRNA (Figure 1F).

Msi1 is enriched in spheroid cultures of lung
cancer cells.
Msi1 expression was evaluated by western blotting
in 14 lung cancer cell lines and one immortalized airway
epithelial cell line (Figure 1A). Msi1 was expressed in
12/14 lung cancer cell lines, with high levels in about half
of them, as well as in the epithelial cell line. To determine
if Msi1 was enriched in stem-like cells, A549 and H520
cells were grown as spheroid cultures in defined medium
in ultra-low attachment plates or under standard conditions
as monolayers. Spheroid cultures contained about a twofold enrichment of Msi1in comparison to monolayers
(Figure 1B), and detection of Msi1 by immunofluorescence
revealed a similar finding (Figure 1C,D). Since CD133
has been widely used as a lung cancer ‘stem cell’ marker

formation was evident in both cell lines (Figure 2B).
Interestingly, H520 cells, which resembled a squamous
cell morphology, were inhibited to a greater extent than
A549 cells, which resembled differentiated glandular
cells (Figure 2B, H&E stained panels). Proliferation of
dissociated spheroid cells expressing the Msi1 shRNA
continued to grow at a reduced rate when grown in
monolayer culture (Figure 2C). Determination of the coexpression of the proliferation marker PCNA and Msi1
following Msi1 KD revealed that Msi1 and PCNA
expression were reduced by 50% and 31%, and by 69%
and 72%, in A549 and H520 cells, respectively (Figure
2D).

and mammary epithelial cells [25]. Following Msi1
KD, there were significant differences in the regulation
of these pathways between A549 and H520 cells. A549
and H520 cells responded differently to Msi1 KD with
respect to Notch and Wnt signaling. Numb was markedly
increased in A549 cells, but was undetectable in H520
cells, whereas, intracellular Notch1 was inhibited in H520
cells and was undetectable in A549 cells (Figure 3A). This
suggests that Notch regulation may be more relevant to
the growth of H520 cells than A549 cells. Since Numb
is a cofactor for Notch ubiquitination [31], it is likely
involved in the regulation of another yet to be identified
target associated with proliferation. To assess the effects of
Msi1 KD on canonical Wnt signaling, cells were analyzed
for the nuclear translocation of β-catenin [32]. Msi1 KD
inhibited β-catenin translocation by >85% in Msi1+ A549
cells (Figure 3B), whereas in H520 cells, localization was
unaffected (Figure 3C), despite both cells lines having a
relatively high percentage of nuclear β-catenin.

Msi1 KD reduces Notch and Wnt signaling
Msi1 was previously reported to inhibit Wnt
pathway activation, as well as Notch activation through
the negative regulator Numb [12, 30] in breast cancer

consistent with the suppression of Numb translation by
Msi1 [12] as previously observed in mammary epithelial
and breast cancer cells [24, 25]. Although Numb
was markedly increased by Msi1 KD in A549 cells,
intracellular Notch was below detection in both control
and Msi1 KD cells, making the association between
Numb and Notch inconclusive. The increase in Numb
in the presence of reduced Wnt signaling also suggests
it is not a TCF/LEF target gene as previously noted [42].
Mechanistically, this could have resulted from a proliferinmediated endocrine pathway as shown in mammary
epithelial cells [25] or from blocking the translation of
Apc, a negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling
[17]. Thus, Wnt pathway activation due to the nuclear
translocation of β-catenin appears to play a dominant role
in the proliferation of Msi1-expressing cells [24, 25, 41].
The majority of primary lung cancer biopsies
exhibited varying patterns of Msi1 expression as
previously noted in lung cancer specimens [23]. Lung
cancer analyzed by tissue microarray or bronchoscopic
biopsy expressed Msi1 protein or RNA in ≥80% of
tumor specimens regardless of histological subtype.
These findings are in general agreement with the report
by Moreira et al. [23], although they found little or no
Msi1 expression in large cell lung cancer and 40%
Msi1+ adenocarcinomas. Other than patient variability
and a smaller sample size, the reasons for disparity are
not obvious. When Msi1 detection was combined with
histopathological examination, the percentage of positive
diagnoses was increased from 81% to 100% (results not
shown), and the higher expression of Msi1 in metastatic
disease may further increase its value as a diagnostic
marker. The association between Msi1 expression in less
differentiated lung cancer cells and proliferation also
suggests that it may serve as a readily accessible marker
of progression or response to therapy if it is present in
sputum and bronchial washings from lung cancer patients.
Overall, our study shows that Msi1 regulates the
proliferation of stem-like spheroid lung tumor cells in
associated with Notch and Wnt signaling. Analyses of lung
cancers indicated that Msi1 protein or RNA expression
can serve as a highly sensitive diagnostic marker for lung
cancer irrespective of the histological subtype.

To evaluate the usefulness of Msi1 as a lung
cancer biomarker, Msi1 localization was examined in
nonmalignant and lung cancer tissue microarrays by
IHC (Figure 4, Table 1). Msi1 was weakly expressed
in scattered cells in airway epithelium (Figure 4A) and
was not present in the normal alveolus (Figure 4B).
Lung tumors expressed Msi1 in a focal (Figure 4D),
scattered (Figure 4E) or diffuse (Figure 4F) pattern in
86% of 202 lung cancer specimens irrespective of age,
gender, histology and stage of disease (Table 1). With
the exception of squamous cell carcinomas, ≥50% of
tumors expressed Msi1 in a diffuse pattern (Figure 4F,
Supplementary Table 1). Msi1 was often expressed at
higher levels in lung tumor metastases than in the primary
tumor, but did not reach statistical significance (P=0.159,
N=15) (Figure 4G-I). Msi1 expression was also assessed
by qRT-PCR in 102 lung cancers and 16 non-malignant
lung tissues collected by bronchoscopic biopsy (Table 2).
Similar to the tissue microarray findings (Table 1), 80%
of lung cancers were Msi1+, irrespective of age, gender,
histology, degree of differentiation or stage of disease, but
was detectable in only 2 of 16 non-malignant specimens
(Supplementary Table 2).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we evaluated the role of Msi1
in the proliferation of lung cancer cells and its utility as a
diagnostic marker for lung cancers of varying histological
subtypes. Msi1 expression was enriched in A549 and
H520 lung cancer cells under cell culture conditions that
promoted the formation of less differentiated spheroid
colonies shown to be enriched for stem-like cells [33].
Similarly, cells sorted for CD133, a cell population
enriched in tumor initiating cells [27-29], were further
enriched for Msi1, in agreement with Msi1 as a stem cell
or early progenitor cell marker , and consistent with its
enrichment in CD133+ breast cancer “mammospheres”
[24], and poorly differentiated oral squamous cell
carcinomas [34]. Silencing Msi1 by RNA interference
reduced spheroid colony proliferation, implicating Msi1
as a regulator of less differentiated stem-like cells.
Thus, Msi1 expression in lung cancer cells has similar
characteristics and function as previously noted for breast
cancer [24], medulloblastoma [35], glioblastoma [36, 37]
and colon cancer [38, 39] cells, and is consistent with the
original observation of Msi1 being a marker for neural
stem and progenitor cells [10, 40].
Msi1 is a positive regulator of Wnt and Notch
signaling [25, 41] and several other pathways that remain
to be explored [18]. A549, but not H520 cells exhibited
a marked upregulation of Numb following Msi1 KD,

virus by incubation with 5 μg/ml puromycin (SigmaAldrich Corp. St. Louis, MO) for 10 days. The efficiency
of integration was monitored by green fluorescent protein
(GFP) co-expressed by the lentivirus.

Spheroid Cell Culture

Cells dissociated as a single cell suspension from
first generation spheroid colonies were seeded in 96-well
plates at 3,000 cells/well in 200 μl medium, and growth
was determined after 24 to 96 hr by sulforhodamine B
staining [25].

Growth Assay

Spheroid cell culture was carried out in ultra-low
attachment plates (Costar, Corning, NY) as described [24].
Briefly, A549 and NCI-H520 cells growing as monolayer
cultures were trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin-0.5 mM
EDTA (Invitrogen), washed twice with PBS, counted and
seeded into a 6-well plate at a density of 3,000 viable cells/
ml or into a 96-well plate at serial dilutions of 1000 to 63
cells per 200 μl. Cells were grown in serum-free DMEM
medium supplemented with 1X B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/
ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma) and 20 ng/
ml basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) (Invitrogen) at
37°C under 5% CO2. Spheroid clusters were counted and
collected by gravity or gentle centrifugation (800 g, 10
sec) after 10 days, and dissociated in 0.05% trypsin-0.5
mM EDTA for 10-15 min by gentle pipetting. Cells were
filtered through a 40-μm nylon mesh sieve (Falcon),
analyzed microscopically for single cellularity and
counted. Successive passages were plated at 1,000 cells/
ml in 6-well plates. Generation 1 (G1) spheres, grown for
10 days, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for
2 hours, washed once. Spheres were collected, embedded
in 4% agarose gel, and placed on ice for 10 minutes. The
spheres were subsequently fixed with 4% PFA overnight
prior to standard histological processing, sectioning,
and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (American
Histolabs Inc., Gaithersburg, MD).

Western Blotting
Western blotting was performed as described [25].
Primary antibodies included rat anti-Msi1 (1:1000)
[45] (14H-1, Dr. Hideyuki Okano, Keio University,
Tokyo, Japan), rabbit anti-Numb (1:1000, Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit anti-Cleaved Notch1
(Val1744) (D3B8) (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology)
and mouse anti-β-actin (1:3000, Sigma).

Flow Cytometry
For CD133 detection, A549 and NCI-H520 cells
were suspended at a concentration of 0.5-1.0×106 cells/
ml in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing
3% fetal bovine serum (PBS/FBS). Cells were sorted with
a Becton Dickinson FACSort system for CD133+ and
CD133- cell populations and analyzed with FCS Express
V3 software (De Novo Software, Ontario, Canada) as
described [24]. Cells were washed twice with PBS. CD133
and Msi1 mRNA expression were detected by RT-PCR in
sorted cells [24].

Lentivirus-mediated shRNA Expression

Msi1 expression was ‘knocked down’ (KD) using
an shRNAmir GIPZ lentiviral vector targeting the
sequence, 5’-CGT CCT GTA TCA TAT GTA AAT-3’ in
the 3’-UTR of Msi1 mRNA (Oligo ID #V2HS_280120;
Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) [24]. TLA-HEK293T
cells (Open Biosystems) were transfected with the TransLentiviral Packaging Mix and pGIPZ transfer vector at
50% confluence using Arrest-In transfection reagent (Open
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
After incubation for 48-72 hr, the virus-containing
supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm
for 20 min at 4°C, mixed 50:50 with fresh cell culture
media, and used to transduce A549 and NCI-H520 cells.

with Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated secondary antibody
(Invitrogen). All incubations were at room temperature
and sections were washed three times for 5 min each in
PBS between each step. Sections were mounted in an

Tissue Microarrays

This study is a prospective analysis of 102 patients
with histologically proven lung cancer and 16 non-cancer
patients treated at Guilin Medical University Hospital and
Affiliated Nan Xi Shan Hospital in China from March,
2011 to December, 2011. All cases were newly diagnosed
and had not received anti-cancer therapy. The study was
approved by the Guilin Medical University Review Board,
and informed consent was obtained from all patients
undergoing the procedures prescribed by the university
ethics committee.

Lung cancer tissue microarray slides were obtained
from Imgenex (San Diego, CA, Cat# IMH-358 and IMH305), US Biomax (Rockville, MD, Cat# LC951) and
Cybrdi (Rockville, MD, cat# CC04-01). There were a
total of 202 cases of primary lung cancer, 16 metastatic
carcinomas and 34 normal or non-tumor adjacent lung
tissues. Patients included 160 males and 42 females
between 26 and 81 years of age, with a median age of
59. The histology subtypes included 53 adenocarcinomas
(Ad), 20 bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (BAC), 4
adenosquamous carcinomas (Ad-Sq), 81 squamous
cell carcinomas (Sq), 15 large cell carcinomas (LCLC),
25 small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) and 4 of other
subtypes (3 mucoepidermoid carcinoma and 1 malignant
mesothelioma). One hundred twenty four contained TNM
stage data (Table S1).

Lung cancer patients
There were a total of 102 lung cancer patients
comprising 84 males and 18 females ranging from 29 to
80 years of age (median = 59.5). Seventy-seven cases
were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 25 cases
small cell lung cancer (SCLC); 60 patients were smokers.
After a clinical examination, patients underwent CT
scans for staging of the tumor. On the basis of clinical
and radiological findings, 89 cases had staging data, and
consisted of 27 cases of stage IV, 51 cases of stage III, 4
cases of stage II and 7 cases of stage I cancer (Table 2).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Tissue microarray slides were baked at 62°C for 1
hr, deparaffinized in xylene for 15 min, and rehydrated
in 100%, 95% and 70% ethanol for 5 min each. Antigen
retrieval was achieved by steaming slides for 10 min in
10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Slides were washed three
times in PBS and blocked for 1 hr in a buffer containing
10% goat serum in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4°C
with a 1:1,000 dilution of rat anti-Msi1 antibody 14H-1
conjugated with biotin [45]. Slides were washed three
times in PBS and antigen visualized with ABC Vectastain
and DAB as substrate (Vector Labs, Burlingame,
CA). Slides were counterstained with Harris-modified
hematoxylin (Thermo-Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) and mounted
in Permount.
The Msi1 expression pattern criteria determined by
IHC included: 1) ‘diffuse’ when almost all cells expressed
the antigen, 2) ‘focal’ when isolated groups of Msi1+ cells
were seen within a histological section and 3) ‘scattered
staining’ when single cells were Msi1+. The level of
Msi1 expression in lung cancer tissue was categorized
by diffusion scores and intensity scores. The criteria of
Msi1 diffusion expression scores were: 0, negative; 1,
1-30% positive cells, 2, 31-60% positive cells, and 3,
>60% positive cells. Intensity scores were: 0, negative,

Non-cancer control group
The control group consisting of 16 patients
undergoing biopsy by fiberoptic bronchoscopy included
6 cases of tuberculosis, 6 cases with a diagnosis of
bronchitis, 2 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of tuberculous
pleurisy and 1 case of brochiectasis (Supplementary Table
2).

Biopsy
All patients underwent bronchoscopy and at
least 5 biopsy specimens were obtained. One to two
specimens were snap frozen and stored at -800 C for
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analysis. The remaining specimens were immersed in
buffered formalin for histopathological evaluation. RTPCR was conducted after confirmation of the diagnosis.

REFERENCES

Total RNA was isolated from the biopsy tissue using
Trizol reagent (TakaRa Bio Inc., Dalian, China) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. One microgram of
template RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using
PrimeScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TakaRa).
PCR was carried out on 1 µl of the cDNA template, 1
µl (10 µM) forward/reverse primers using 2X GoldStar
Taq MasterMix (CoWin Bioscience, Bejing, China) in
final volume of 25 µl. The DNA thermal cycler conditions
used were 940C for 5 min (pre-denature), and 35 cycles of
940C for 1 min, 56.20C (for Msi1) or 620C (for beta-actin)
for 30s and 720C for 45s, followed by a final extension
of 720C for 2 min. Six µl of each of Msi1 and β-actin
PCR-amplified product was mixed and fractionated on a
2% agarose gel, which was then visualized by ethidium
bromide staining using a JS-780 Gel Image Analysis
System (Peiqing Sci Tech., Ltd, Shanghai, China). The
primer pairs yield PCR products of 306 bp for Msi1 and
417 bp for β-actin, respectively. Primers for Msi1 were:
5’-GCT CGA CTC CAA AAC AAT TGA CC-3’ (forward)
and 5’-GGC TGA GCT TTC TTA CAT TCC AC-3’
(reverse). Primer sequences for β-actin were: 5’-ACA
GAG CCT CGC CTT TGC CGA TC-3’(forward) and 5’TGG GTC ATC TTC TCG CGG TTG G-3’(reverse).
For quantitation of RT-PCR products, the integrated
density of the PCR bands in the agarose gel was measured
by a JS-780 Gel Image Analysis System. The relative
level of Msi1 expression = Msi1 integrated density/βactin integrated density. mRNA was obtained from cells
in exponential growth and the PCR cycle numbers of Msi1
and β-actin during were based on the integrated density
from 20 to 40 cycles.
