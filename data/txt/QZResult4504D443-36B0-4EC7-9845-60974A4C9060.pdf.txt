Abstract
The RAS pathway is one of the most frequently deregulated
pathways in cancer. RAS signals through multiple effector
pathways, including the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK)/ERK MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)-AKT signaling cascades. The oncogenic potential of
these effector pathways is illustrated by the frequent occurrence of activating mutations in BRAF and PIK3CA as well as
loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN, a
negative regulator of PI3K. Previous studies have found that
whereas BRAF mutant cancers are highly sensitive to MEK
inhibition, RAS mutant cancers exhibit a more variable response. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneous response remain unclear. In this study, we show
that PI3K pathway activation strongly influences the sensitivity of RAS mutant cells to MEK inhibitors. Activating
mutations in PIK3CA reduce the sensitivity to MEK inhibition,
whereas PTEN mutations seem to cause complete resistance.
We further show that down-regulation of PIK3CA resensitizes
cells with co-occurring KRAS and PIK3CA mutations to MEK
inhibition. At the molecular level, the dual inhibition of both
pathways seems to be required for complete inhibition of the
downstream mammalian target of rapamycin effector pathway and results in the induction of cell death. Finally, we
show that whereas inactivation of either the MEK or PI3K
pathway leads to partial tumor growth inhibition, targeted
inhibition of both pathways is required to achieve tumor
stasis. Our study provides molecular insights that help explain the heterogeneous response of KRAS mutant cancers
to MEK pathway inhibition and presents a strong rationale
for the clinical testing of combination MEK and PI3K targeted therapies. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4286–93]

Introduction
RAS is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human
cancer (1). Oncogenic mutations in RAS lead to deregulation of
several effector pathways that control cell proliferation, survival,
and migration and thus promote malignant transformation. The
best-characterized RAS effector pathway is the RAF-mitogenNote: Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research Online

activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) MAPK cascade. RAF becomes activated,
in part, through RAS-mediated recruitment to the plasma
membrane, where RAF activates MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn
activate ERK1 and ERK2. ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylate several
cytosolic and nuclear proteins, including transcription factors that
control the G1-S cell cycle transition (1). Approximately 30% of all
human tumors exhibit signs of MAPK pathway activation based on
high phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 (2). Whereas many growth
signaling pathways regulate MAPK activation, deregulation of this
pathway in cancers occurs most frequently through activating
mutations in KRAS or BRAF. Given the strong genetic evidence
implicating the RAS pathway in the etiology of human cancer,
much effort has focused on the development of therapeutic agents
that inhibit critical downstream pathway components, such as RAF
and MEK kinases (3, 4).
KRAS also stimulates signaling through the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (5). The PI3K family encompasses lipid
kinases that convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which in turn initiates a
signaling cascade that promotes cell growth and survival (6). In
addition to activation by oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases,
deregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway in cancers can also
occur through activating mutations in PIK3CA, which encodes the
catalytic p110a kinase subunit, or through loss-of-function
mutations in the lipid phosphatase PTEN (7, 8). Extensive crosstalk has been observed between the PI3K and RAS-RAF-MEK
signaling pathways. In addition to RAS activating both RAF-MEK
and PI3K signaling, both pathways can modulate the activity of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase through the
negative regulation of the TSC1/2 complex (9–13).
Most cancers exhibit a myriad of genetic and epigenetic changes,
and ‘‘driver’’ oncogenic lesions are selected during the clonal
expansion of cancers if they provide a growth or survival benefit.
Hence, mutations in components of the same signaling pathway
often exhibit a pattern of mutual exclusivity when there is no or
little selective advantage gained from the acquisition of multiple
pathway lesions. For example, activating mutations in both RAS
and BRAF are rarely found to coexist in the same tumor (14–16).
Similarly, mutations in PI3K and PTEN are rarely concurrent (17).
In the case of RAS and PI3K pathway mutations, however, the
situation seems to be more complex. Whereas RAS and PI3K
pathway mutations are found to be mutually exclusive in breast
cancers, a significant fraction (22%) of colorectal cancers have
genetic lesions in both pathways (18, 19). The molecular
significance and therapeutic implications, however, of co-occurring
mutations in the PI3K and RAS pathway are presently unclear.
A recent study found that the proliferation of BRAF mutant
cancers is strongly affected by pharmacologic MEK pathway
inhibition, whereas RAS mutant cell lines exhibited a more varied

response and were generally found to be less sensitive to a MEK1/2
inhibitor (20). The molecular mechanism responsible for this
variable response of RAS mutant cancers is currently not known. In
this study, we found that activation of the PI3K pathway strongly
influences the response of KRAS mutant cancers to MEK inhibitors.
Activating mutations in PIK3CA significantly decrease the response
to MEK pathway inhibition, reflected by a more than 10-fold shift
in IC50 required to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly,
loss of PTEN function leads to even more pronounced resistance to
MEK pathway inhibition. We further show that p110a downregulation is able to resensitize tumors with coexisting KRAS and
PIK3CA mutations to MEK pathway inhibition both in vitro and
in vivo. Together, these findings provide a strong rationale for
combination therapies of PI3K and MEK inhibitors for cancers that
harbor concurrent mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Reagents
LS513 and SW620 were generous gifts from Neal Rosen (Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). All other cell lines were obtained

from the American Type Culture Collection. All untransduced cells were
cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). All short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–transduced
cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% Tet-approved FBS
(Clontech) in the presence of appropriate antibiotic selection. Expression of
shRNA was induced by growing cells in the presence of 10 to 100 ng/mL of
doxycycline (Sigma).

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1% NP40, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L
NaF, 40 mmol/L h-glycerol phosphate, and 1 Halt protease inhibitor
cocktail (Pierce). All primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology, unless otherwise noted: anti-p110a, phospho-AKT, total AKT,
total PTEN, phospho-S6, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho–glycogen synthase
kinase 3h (GSK3h), total ERK, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and
cleaved caspase-7. Anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) was purchased from Imgenex, anti-PRAS40 from Invitrogen,
and anti-KRAS from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked in Odyssey
blocking buffer followed by immunodetection with the indicated primary
antibodies. Secondary antibody IRDye800 anti-rabbit and IRDye680 antimouse were purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals.

cells were stably transduced with either control or PTEN inducible shRNA. Lysates from cells grown in the presence or absence of doxycycline (DOX ) for 96 h were
harvested for immunoblot analysis. D, the IC50 value of SW620 cells containing either control or PTEN inducible shRNA in response to PD0325901 treatment is
graphed. Effect on cell growth was determined 72 h after inhibitor treatment by CellTiter-Glo. PTEN depletion renders KRAS mutant cell lines insensitive to MEK
inhibition.

dependent. A, BxPC3, SW480, and HCT116 cells transduced
with control or KRAS inducible shRNA were cultured in the
presence or absence of doxycycline (10 ng/mL) for 72 h and
harvested for immunoblot analysis. Knockdown of KRAS and
its effect on downstream signaling, through changes in
phospho-473AKT (pAKT ), phospho-PRAS40 (pPRAS40 ), and
phospho-S6 (pS6) status, were determined. B, BxPC3 and
SW480 cells seeded at 2,500 per well and HCT116 cells
seeded at 500 per well were plated in a 96-well dish and grown
in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Cell viability was
determined by Alamar Blue.

Apoptosis and Proliferation Analysis

Lentiviral RNA Interference

Apoptosis. Cells were grown in 10 cm2 dish for 48 h in the presence or
absence of 10 ng/mL doxycycline followed by treatment with 50 nmol/L
PD0325901 for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in PBS
containing 10% NP40, 37% formaldehyde, and 1 mg/mL Hoechst 33342.
Apoptotic or fragmented nuclei were visualized and counted under a UV
microscope.
Soft agar assay. Cells were plated at 2,000 to 4,000 per well in a 96-well
plate (Costar). An equal volume of 0.6% agarose (FMC Bioproducts) was
added to each well to a final volume of 100 AL/well. After an hour at room
temperature, the cells were kept in a 37jC and 5% CO2 incubator for 2 wk.
Doxycycline, at a final concentration of 100 ng/mL, was replenished every
72 h. Colonies were then stained with the fluorophore Alamar Blue
(Biosource International) and read 5 h afterwards in a fluorescence
spectrophotometer equipped with a 540 excitation filter and 590 emission
filter. Proliferation and colony formation assays were carried out as
described previously (6).

Compound Treatment
The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901 and etoposide were dissolved in DMSO
to a final concentration of 10 mmol/L and stored at 20jC. Cells were plated
in triplicate 96-well plates at 2,000 to 5,000 per well. After overnight attachment, cells were treated with serial dilutions of the indicated compound.
Cells were incubated in the presence of compound for 72 h and viable cells
were measured by CellTiter-Glo (Promega). The IC50 was calculated using
Excel XLFit program using the one-site dose-response model 205.

Tumor Xenografts
Female athymic nude mice (Harlan) were acclimated in Novartis
Institutes for BioMedical Research animal facility with ad libitum access
to food and water for 3 d before manipulation. Animals were handled in
accordance with Novartis Animal Care and Use Committee protocols and
regulations. HCT116 cells engineered with Tet-inducible shRNA against
PIK3CA were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% Tet-approved FBS.
Mice (6–8 wk old, n = 8) were inoculated s.c. with 1  106 cells in the right
dorsal axillary region. Tumor volume was measured by calipering in two
dimensions and calculated as (length  width2) / 2. Drug treatment started
11 d after implant when average tumor volume was 110 mm3. Animals
received vehicle (5% dextrose, 10 mL/kg, orally, four times daily),
doxycycline hyclate (25 mg/kg, orally, four times daily), or PD0325901
(6 mg/kg, orally, four times daily) for the duration of the study (17 d).
Doxycycline was dissolved in 5% dextrose, whereas PD0325901 was
formulated in 10% ethanol, 10% propylene glycol, and 16% Captisol.
A separate set of animals (n = 3) was dosed for 5 d with vehicle control,

doxycycline, and/or PD0325901 for biomarker analyses only. At termination
of the study, tumor tissue was excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for
immunoblot analyses of biomarkers.

Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR
mRNA levels were measured using Taqman Gene Expression Assays on
an ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System supplied by Applied
Biosystems. RNA isolation was performed using the Qiagen TurboCapture
mRNA kit and followed by cDNA synthesis (iScript; Bio-Rad). The PIK3CA
probe was purchased from Applied Biosystems. VIC-MGB B-Actin primers
were used in each reaction to coamplify the actin transcript. All experiments
were performed in triplicate and normalized to h-actin levels. Relative mRNA
expression was calculated using the formula 2 (C T of sample C T of h-actin),
where C T (cycle count) is the threshold cycle value.

Results
PI3K pathway activation in KRAS mutant cancer cells
confers resistance to MEK inhibitors. To identify molecular
modifiers that influence the sensitivity of KRAS mutant cancers to
MEK pathway inhibition, we profiled a panel of cancer cell lines to
determine their response to the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901,
which inhibits ERK phosphorylation with an IC50 of 10 to 20 nmol/L
(Fig. 1B; ref. 22). Given the frequent co-occurrence of KRAS and
PI3K pathway lesions, many of these cell lines harbored both KRAS
and PI3K pathway mutations (Fig. 1A). As expected, cell lines that
are wild-type for KRAS were generally insensitive to PD0325901
(Fig. 1A, black columns). However, the sensitivity of the 11 KRAS
mutant cell lines to the MEK1/2 inhibitor varied drastically. We
noted that the sensitivity to MEK inhibitors seemed to strongly
correlate with the PI3K pathway mutation status. For example, four

of five cell lines that harbor KRAS mutations but have a wild-type
PI3K pathway are very sensitive to MEK inhibitor treatment (Fig. 1A,
light gray columns), with IC50 values similar to those required for
complete phospho-ERK suppression (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cell lines
harboring activating mutations in PIK3CA were significantly less
sensitive to MEK pathway inhibition. It is important to note that the
antiproliferative effect in HCT116 cells (IC50 of 400 nmol/L), for
example, occurred at concentration of PD0325901 that was much
higher than that required for the complete suppression of phosphoERK (20 nmol/L). Strikingly, cancer cells with loss of PTEN
function were far more resistant to MEK1/2 inhibitors, as their
proliferation was not affected even at micromolar concentrations.
The MEK1/2 inhibitor blocked MEK-ERK signaling with similar
efficiency in sensitive and resistant cells, excluding the possibility
that incomplete target modulation accounts for the varying
responses.
These findings provide strong correlative evidence that activation of the PI3K pathway renders KRAS mutant cancer cells less
sensitive to MEK pathway inhibition. To test this hypothesis
directly, we engineered a KRAS mutant cell line to inducibly
activate the PI3K pathway. We introduced an inducible shRNA
targeting PTEN into the SW620 cell line, which harbors a KRAS
mutation but has an intact PI3K pathway. PTEN depletion strongly
increased the phosphorylation of AKT, a downstream marker of
PI3K pathway activation (Fig. 1C). In addition, PTEN depletion
strongly reduced the sensitivity of SW620 cells to the MEK1/2
inhibitor (Fig. 1D), providing direct evidence that PI3K pathway
activation in KRAS mutant cells is sufficient to confer resistance to
MEK-ERK inhibition.

Cells with coexisting mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA still
exhibit KRAS dependency. The observation that KRAS mutant
cells with PI3K pathway activation were less sensitive to MEK
inhibition raised the question as to whether these cells more
generally lost dependence on KRAS signaling or only the MEK
effector pathway. To specifically address this question, BxPC3,
SW480, and HCT116 cell lines were engineered to inducibly express
shRNAs targeting KRAS. The induction of KRAS shRNAs resulted
in a significant reduction of KRAS mRNA levels (Supplementary
Fig. S1A–C) and KRAS protein (Fig. 2A). KRAS depletion in the
KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell line SW480 strongly impaired
proliferation (Fig. 2B) and efficiently suppressed downstream
pathway signaling, as measured by the phosphorylation of ERK,
AKT, and the AKT substrates S6 and PRAS40 (Fig. 2A). In contrast,
the proliferation of BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cell line, which is
wild-type for both KRAS and the PI3K pathway, was not affected by
KRAS depletion. When we tested HCT116 cells, which harbor
mutations in both KRAS and PIK3CA, we found that KRAS
depletion strongly affected proliferation and downstream MAPK
signaling. These results indicate that HCT116 cells remain
dependent on KRAS signaling, consistent with previously published
data (23). Interestingly, KRAS knockdown had a stronger effect on
reducing phospho-ERK levels compared with phospho-AKT in
HCT116 cells presumably because mutational activation of p110a
at least partially bypasses the need for KRAS signaling for the
activation of the AKT pathway. Taken together, our results show
that cells harboring mutations in both the PI3K and KRAS
pathways are still dependent on KRAS function despite their
reduced sensitivity to MEK pathway inhibition.
Inhibition of p110A sensitizes HCT116 cells to MEK pathway
inhibition. We and others have previously shown that cell lines
with PIK3CA activating mutations, such as HCT116, are dependent
on PIK3CA activity for proliferation and AKT pathway signaling
(6, 7). However, blocking PI3K activity only reduced but did not
completely prevent cell growth or in vivo tumor formation,
indicating that additional pathways contribute to the transformed
phenotype (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2A–D). Based on our
previous finding that KRAS depletion also caused a strong
antiproliferative effect in HCT116 cells, we wanted to directly
compare the effects of p110a and KRAS depletion. Whereas
PIK3CA knockdown caused a marked reduction in PI3K pathway
signaling (phospho-AKT and phospho-S6 in Fig. 3A), cell proliferation (Fig. 3B), and colony formation (Supplementary Fig. S2A), we
found that KRAS depletion resulted in a significantly greater
antiproliferative effect (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2A and C). We
reasoned that this more pronounced dependency may stem from
the ability of KRAS to activate both PI3K and MEK-ERK pathways.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that whereas PIK3CA
depletion only affected AKT pathway activation, KRAS depletion
strongly reduced both phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT downstream signaling (Fig. 3A).
These findings suggested that inhibition of both downstream
effector pathways may be required to achieve maximal antiproliferative effects. We therefore tested the effects of combined
inhibition of p110a and MEK using two independent inducible
shRNAs targeting PIK3CA and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901.
Indeed, blocking both pathways resulted in stronger antiproliferative effects compared with blocking either pathway alone (Fig. 3C
and D; Supplementary Fig. S3A and C). Notably, whereas both MEK
and PI3K pathway inhibition alone reduced phospho-S6 and
phospho-GSK3 levels, only the combined inhibition of MEK and

doxycycline. A, lysate was harvested from cells treated with 10 nmol/L

of cells in sub-G1 in the presence or absence of PIK3CA knockdown was

with PD0325901 for 48 h. Cells were subsequently fixed with formaldehyde
and stained with Hoechst 33342 to visualize fragmented nuclei. For each
treatment condition, 1,500 cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope.

p110a resulted in complete suppression of phosphorylation of both
proteins (Fig. 3C, lane 8). Together, these findings show that the
combined inhibition of the PI3K and MEK-ERK pathways leads to
more pronounced growth inhibition in HCT116 cells.
Combined inhibition of the MEK and PI3K pathways
induces cell death. We next wanted to explore the molecular
mechanism responsible for the increased antiproliferative effect in
response to combined inhibition of the MEK and PI3K pathways.
We have previously shown that PIK3CA knockdown in HCT116
cells results in a prolonged G1-phase arrest with little effect on cell
survival (6). We therefore wanted to investigate whether the more
potent growth-inhibitory effect elicited by the combination

treatment may be a result of increased cell death. Depletion of
either PIK3CA or MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment alone did not induce
a significant apoptotic response (Fig. 4). However, combining the
depletion of PIK3CA with MEK inhibitor treatment induced several
markers of apoptosis, including cleavage of PARP and caspase-7
(Fig. 4A), sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 4B), and apoptotic nuclei
(Fig. 4C). These findings indicate that the growth-inhibitory effects
in response to simultaneous disruption of MEK-ERK and PI3K
pathway signaling are at least in part mediated by an increase in
apoptotic cell death.
Combined inhibition of p110A and MEK is most effective in
cancer cells with coexisting mutations in PIK3CA and KRAS.
Given the promising response of HCT116 cells to combined
inhibition of p110a and MEK1/2, we wanted to further investigate
which cancer cells are most responsive to this combination
strategy. We therefore tested whether PIK3CA depletion increases
the sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 across a panel of
cancer cell lines that differ in their KRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN status.
Each cell line was stably transduced with an inducible shRNA
targeting PIK3CA, and effective knockdown of PIK3CA in response
to doxycycline treatment was verified by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; Fig. 5A). The IC50 for PD0325901 was
measured in cells expressing PIK3CA ( DOX) and cells depleted
for PIK3CA (+DOX). An IC50 ratio ( DOX/+DOX) of >1 indicates
that the cell line is more sensitive to PD0325901 treatment when
the PI3K pathway is inhibited (Fig. 5B). Strikingly, all cell lines with
concurrent activating mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA (HCT116,

NCI-H460, and DLD1) exhibited a markedly increased sensitivity to
PD0325901 when PIK3CA expression was down-regulated. In
contrast, the two cell lines with coexisting mutations in KRAS
and PTEN, DU145 and PC3, were not sensitized by PIK3CA
depletion. Whereas recent studies indicate that PIK3CB rather than
PIK3CA is the major PI3K isoform driving the proliferation of PTEN
mutant cancer cell lines (6, 24), we surprisingly found that
knockdown of PIK3CB in PC3 cells did not increase its sensitivity
to PD0325901 (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). We confirmed that
PIK3CA down-regulation did not cause a general sensitization to
compound treatment, as PIK3CA depletion did not influence the
sensitivity to the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (Fig. 5B).
Together, these findings indicate that inhibition of p110a sensitizes
KRAS mutant cancer cells with PIK3CA, but not PTEN mutations,
to MEK pathway inhibition.
Combined inhibition of the MEK and PI3K pathways
potently inhibits tumor growth of HCT116 in vivo. We next
wanted to examine whether the synergistic antiproliferative effect
of combined MEK and PI3K pathway inhibition can be recapitulated in vivo. To test this, HCT116 xenografts stably expressing
inducible PIK3CA shRNA were implanted into nude mice.
Doxycycline treatment (+DOX) strongly reduced the levels of
p110a and decreased the phosphorylation of downstream pathway
components, including AKT and PRAS40, whereas treatment with
PD0325901 strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 6B).
In concordance with the results from our in vitro studies, we found
that whereas either PIK3CA knockdown or PD0325901 alone

reduced phospho-S6 levels, only the combined treatment led to
complete ablation of S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). In the tumor
growth studies, we found that whereas inhibition of either pathway
alone via PIK3CA depletion or PD0325901 treatment reduced
tumor growth (70% and 28% growth compared with vehicle
controls, respectively), tumor stasis was observed only with
combination treatment (2% residual tumor growth compared with
controls; Fig. 6A). In addition, significant tumor regression during
the first 21 days was only observed in response to the combination
treatment. These findings further support the notion that complete
inhibition of downstream mTOR signaling may be required to
achieve maximal antitumor effects. Collectively, our study shows
that cancer cells harboring concurrent mutations in KRAS and
PIK3CA rely on both signaling pathways for growth and survival
and suggests a clear rationale for combination therapies for
cancers harboring these genetic lesions.

Discussion
Due to its prevalent deregulation in cancer, the RAS/RAF/MEK/
ERK pathway has been an attractive target for therapeutic
intervention, resulting in the development of several potent MEK
inhibitors (3). A previous study found that whereas BRAF mutant
cancers are very sensitive to pharmacologic MEK inhibitors, RAS
mutant cancers exhibit a more variable response to these
compounds (20). The molecular underpinnings of this heterogeneous response, however, remain largely unexplored. In this study,
we profiled a larger panel of KRAS mutant cancer cell lines for their
response to the allosteric MEK inhibitor PD0325901. In agreement
with the study of Solit and colleagues, we observed that the
sensitivity of KRAS mutant cancer cells to MEK inhibitor varied
extensively despite efficient MEK pathway inhibition in resistant
and sensitive settings. We noted that the majority of MEK inhibitor–
insensitive cell lines harbored activating mutations in the PI3K
pathway as a result of either activating mutations in PIK3CA or lossof-function mutations in PTEN. In contrast, four of five KRAS
mutant cancers with an intact PI3K pathway exhibited exquisite
sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor. In addition to this correlative
evidence, we directly show that depletion of PTEN renders a
previously MEK inhibitor–sensitive KRAS mutant cell line resistant
to MEK pathway inhibition. Collectively, these findings show that
PI3K pathway activation is a major resistance mechanism that
impairs the efficacy of MEK inhibitors in KRAS mutated cancers.
This observation parallels the clinical finding that PI3K pathway
mutations confer resistance to trastuzumab therapy in HER2overexpressing breast cancers (25).
Although our study clearly shows that PI3K pathway activation
renders KRAS mutant cancers less sensitive to MEK inhibitors,
we noted that the extent of resistance conferred by PIK3CA and
PTEN mutations seems to differ significantly. Activating mutations in PIK3CA caused a 5- to 10-fold shift in IC50, whereas loss
of PTEN function apparently conferred complete resistance. It
is important to note that the more modest increase in IC50
in the presence of PIK3CA mutations is likely to be clinically
relevant, as increased dosing of MEK inhibitors may not be an
option due to dose-limiting toxicities. Moreover, these findings
further support the notion that mutational activation of PIK3CA
is not functionally equivalent to loss of PTEN. It is currently not
clear, however, whether this phenotypic difference is due to more
potent activation of downstream PI3K pathway by PTEN loss or
due to PI3K pathway–independent functions of PTEN (26–28).

Figure 6. Combined inhibition of the PI3K and MEK-ERK pathways results in
tumor stasis in vivo. A, stable HCT116 cells containing PIK3CA inducible
shRNA were implanted into nude mice and administered vehicle control or
doxycycline in combination with PD0325901 (6 mg/kg). Tumor size was
measured using calipers. Points, mean; bars, SE. B, tumors harvested from
vehicle-, doxycycline-, and/or PD0325901-treated mice for 5 d were analyzed by
immunoblot with the respective antibodies.

The observation that co-occurring PI3K pathway mutations
render KRAS mutant cancer cells less sensitive to MEK inhibitors
prompted us to investigate whether we could use these insights to
design rational combination strategies. We focused our studies on
down-regulation of PIK3CA, as this is the most frequently
deregulated PI3K isoform in human cancers. Indeed, we found
that PIK3CA depletion in cancer cell lines with concurrent PIK3CA
and KRAS mutations sensitized those cells to MEK inhibitors.
However, in cancer cell lines with coexisting PTEN and KRAS
mutations, neither PIK3CA nor PIK3CB depletion was sufficient to
sensitize these cells to MEK inhibitors. This finding suggests that in
the background of a KRAS mutation, PTEN mutant cells may rely
on multiple p110 isoforms for growth and survival signaling. Thus,
it will be important to test in future studies if pan-PI3K inhibitors
will synergize with MEK inhibitors in cancers with coexisting PTEN
and KRAS lesions.
We previously found that inhibition of p110a in HCT116 cells,
which harbor PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, causes cells to arrest in
G1 but not cell death (6). In this study, we show that combined
inhibition of the MEK and PI3K pathways is required to induce an
apoptotic response. This enhanced apoptotic response translates

into augmented antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. At the
molecular level, we noted that the phosphorylation status of the
ribosomal protein S6 correlates much better with antiproliferative
response compared with more upstream pathway markers such as
phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK. Whereas the inhibition of MEK
and p110a reduced phospho-S6 levels, only the combined pathway
inhibition led to a complete suppression of S6 phosphorylation in
both in vitro and in vivo studies. Given that the MEK-ERK and
PI3K-AKT pathways converge on the regulation of mTOR through
their regulation of TSC1/2, pharmacodynamic response markers
downstream of mTOR may serve as an integrating signal of both
upstream pathways.
In summary, our study provides a molecular explanation for the
heterogeneous response of KRAS mutant cancer cells to MEK
inhibitors and further underscores the need to tailor cancer
therapies to match the genetic context of the cancers to achieve
optimal treatment response. Our findings and other recent studies
(17, 29, 30) provide a strong rationale for the combination of PI3K
and MEK inhibitors in cancers with coexisting PIK3CA and KRAS

PI3K pathway lesions are likely to present a major mechanism of
acquired resistance in clinical settings with MEK inhibitors. In this
light, it will be important in future studies to explore whether
combination therapy with PI3K and MEK inhibitors will be able to
prevent the emergence of such resistance.
