ABSTRACT
Purpose: Pregnane x receptor (PXR) - activated overexpression of the multidrug
resistance 1 (MDR1) gene is an important way for tumor cells to acquire drug
resistance. However, the detailed mechanism still remains unclear. In the present
study, we aimed to investigate whether protein arginine methyl transferase 1(PRMT1)
is involved in PXR - activated overexpression of MDR1 during acquired multidrug
resistant.
Experimental Design: Arginine methyltransferase inhibitor 1 (AMI-1) was used
to pharmacologically block PRMT1 in resistant breast cancer cells (MCF7/adr). The
mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 were detected by real-time PCR and western
blotting analysis. Immunofluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation
were used to investigate the physical interaction between PXR and PRMT1. Then,
136 candidate compounds were screened for PRMT1 inhibitors. Lastly, luciferase
reporter gene and nude mice bearing resistant breast cancer xenografts were
adopted to investigate the anti-tumor effect of PRMT1 inhibitors when combined
with adriamycin.
Results: AMI-1 significantly suppressed the expression of MDR1 in MCF7/adr
cells and increased cells sensitivity of MCF7/adr to adriamycin. Physical interaction
between PRMT1 and PXR exists in MCF7/adr cells, which could be disrupted by AMI-1.
Those results suggest that PRMT1 may be involved in PXR-activated overexpression
of MDR1 in resistant breast cancer cells, and AMI-1 may suppress MDR1 by disrupting
the interaction between PRMT1 and PXR. Then, five compounds including rutin,
isoquercitrin, salvianolic acid A, naproxen, and felodipline were identified to be PRMT1
inhibitors. Finally, those PRMT1 inhibitors were observed to significantly decrease
MDR1 promoter activity in vitro and enhance the antitumor effect of adriamycin in
nude mice that bearing resistant breast cancer xenografts.
Conclusions: PRMT1 may be an important co-activator of PXR in activating MDR1
gene during acquired resistance, and PRMT1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy
drugs may be a new strategy for overcoming tumor MDR.

INTRODUCTION

and co-immunoprecipitation. Next, we built a highthroughput drug-screening platform based on fluorescence
polarization signal analysis to screen for PRMT1
inhibitors, and 136 candidates were screened. Finally, we
used dual luciferase reporter gene systems and nude mice
bearing resistant breast cancer cells to identify the antitumor effect of PRMT1 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major limiting
factor to successful chemotherapy in a variety of
cancers [1, 2]. Currently, the acquired high expression
of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the human
multidrug resistance gene (MDR1 /ABCB1), is the
primary mechanism of tumor MDR [3, 4]. However, the
mechanisms by which tumor cells acquire overexpressed
P-gp have not been clearly characterized.
Pregnane x receptor (PXR) is an orphan nuclear
receptor that have been proven to play an essential role in
the development of MDR [5–7]. In vitro, tumor cells can
be induced to acquire MDR by incubating with anticancer
drugs either at low concentrations with persistent exposure
or at high concentrations with intermittent exposure
[8]. However, pharmacological inhibition or genetic
knockdown of PXR attenuates drug-stimulated MDR1
overexpression and reverses drug resistance [9–10]. It
is likely that chemotherapeutic agents stimulate MDR1
overexpression in a PXR-activation pathway. According
to previous studies [11, 12], the activation of PXR requires
a ligand and several co-activators. After the ligand binds
to PXR, the co-activators are recruited to PXR to form a
PXR-co-activator complex and start the transcription of
MDR1. A large number of traditional chemotherapy drugs,
such as adriamycin, paclitaxel, microtubule-stabilizing
agents, and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
are exogenous ligands of PXR [13, 14]. It is possible that
the binding of these chemotherapy agents and PXR is the
initial step for acquired resistance in tumors.
Moreover, epigenetic modifications may affect the
activity of PXR [15]. Protein arginine methyltransferase
1 (PRMT1) is an epigenetic modifier that methylates
arginine 3 of histone H4 (H4R3) [16]. H4R3 methylation
is an early promoter event during gene activation, which is
essential for many subsequent histone modifications [17,
18]. Studies suggest that H4R3 methylation facilitates
the transcriptional activation of nuclear receptors [19].
PRMT1 functions as a co-activator of the farnesyl X
receptor (FXR) and stimulate the transcription of FXR
responsive genes through histone H4R3 methylation
[20]. Also, PRMT1 have been reported to be a major
histone methyltransferase associated with PXR [21, 22].
Hence, PRMT1 may be an important co-activator of PXR
in activating MDR1 gene during acquired multidrug
resistant.
Arginine methyltransferase inhibitor 1 (AMI-1) is a
selective PRMT1 inhibitor [23], which could significantly
inhibit the activity of PRMT1. In current study, AMI1 was used to pharmacologically block PRMT1 in
adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF7/adr.
The mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 were detected
by real-time PCR and western blotting analysis. Then,
we studied the mechanism by which AMI-1 decrease
the expression of MDR1 using immunofluorescence

RESULTS
P-gp, PXR, and PRMT1 were highly expressed
in resistant breast cancer cells
Results from reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
indicated that MDR1 (699 bp), PXR (489 bp), and
PRMT1 (535 bp) mRNA were more highly expressed in
MCF7/adr cells than in MCF7 cells (Figure 1a), which
were further confirmed by real-time PCR (qPCR) (Figure
1b). Consistently, the protein expression levels of P-gp
(170 kDa), PXR (50 kDa), and PRMT1 (41 kDa) were
significantly higher in MCF7/adr cells than in MCF7 cells
(Figure 1c).

AMI-1 suppressed the expression of P-gp
Based on the possibility that PRMT1 may be an
important co-activator of PXR and PXR serves as a pivotal
activator of P-gp, we supposed that PRMT1 inhibitor
may decrease the expression of P-gp in resistant breast
cancer cells. The mRNA and protein levels of P-gp, PXR,
and PRMT1 were measured in MCF7/adr and MCF7
cells after incubation with 4.5 μg/mL of AMI-1 [30]
for 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. RT-PCR and qPCR results
indicated that MDR1 mRNA decreased in MCF7/adr
cells after incubation with AMI-1 for 6 h, while MDR1
mRNA in MCF7 cells did not change (Fig. 2a and 2b).
Western blotting analysis indicated that P-gp expression
declined in a time-dependent manner in MCF7/adr cells
after incubation with AMI-1 for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h
(Figure 2c). Moreover, AMI-1 had no significant effect on
mRNA expression of PXR and PRMT1 (Fig. 2a and 2b).
Likewise, the protein levels of PXR and PRMT1 in MCF7/
adr cells were not significantly decreased (Figure 2c).
Interestingly, despite being known as a PRMT1 inhibitor,
AMI-1 did not significantly decrease the expression of
PRMT1. This suggests that the mechanism of AMI-1 may
refer to functional inhibition. The subcellular localization
of PXR and PRMT1 were highly consistent in MCF7/adr
cells, which changed after incubating with 4.5 μg/mL of
AMI-1 for 24 h (Figure 2d). This suggests that protein
interaction may exist between PXR and PRMT1 within
MCF7/adr cells. Next, co-immunoprecipitation was used
to test the physical interactions between the two proteins.
As shown in Figure 2e, physical interaction between PXR
and PRMT1 was detected in MCF7/adr cells, and this
interaction could be disrupted by treating the cells with

drug resistance by the induction of antitumor agents in
vitro, and they maintain this resistance for weeks after the
inducing drugs are removed [31, 32]. It has been proposed
that there are internal MDR1- activating mechanisms in
tumor cells that are activated by antitumor agents and
continue to act after the agents are removed.
To determine whether PRMT1 is involved in the
maintenance of P-gp overexpression after removal of
inducing drugs, the expression of P-gp in MCF7/adr cells
were monitored for 14 days after removing adriamycin.
Since adriamycin was removed from medium 2 weeks
before the assay, the first day of experiment was actually
the 15th day after removal of adriamycin. As shown
in Figs. 3a, 3b and 3c, the mRNA and protein levels of
P-gp did not decrease significantly within the 14 days
during the experiment, but did appear to decrease after
treating with AMI-1 (Figs. 3a, 3b and 3d). The subcellular
localization of PRMT1 was still in consistence with
PXR on the 14th day of the experiment, and interaction
between the two proteins was verified by co-IP (Figures
3e and f). After treatment with 4.5 μg/mL of AMI1 for 24 h, PXR and PRMT1 partly migrated from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm (Figure 3e) and the binding
between the two proteins was destroyed (Figure 3f).

4.5 μg/mL of AMI-1 for 24 h. These results suggested that
the binding of PRMT1 and PXR may be a prerequisite
for overexpression of P-gp in resistant cells. Inhibition of
PRMT1 suppresses P-gp expression and the mechanism
may refer to the disruption of the interaction between
PRMT1 and PXR.
It is possible that the sensitivity of resistant cells to
antitumor agents increase after incubating with AMI-1 due
to the decreased expression of P-gp. To test this possibility,
the cytotoxicity of adriamycin (between 0.001 and 100 μg/
mL) in MCF7, MCF7/adr, and AMI-1 pretreated MCF7/
adr cells were measured. The results showed that IC50
decreased approximately 8.6 fold in MCF7/adr cells that
were pretreated with 4.5 µg/mL of AMI-1 for 72 h (Figure
2f). This result suggested that inhibition of PRMT1 may
increase the sensitivity of resistant cells to antitumor
agents and reverse the tumor resistance.

PRMT1 is required for maintenance of P-gp
overexpression
In clinical, once multidrug resistance occurs,
resistance continues for a long period of time even if the
inducing drugs are removed. Likewise, tumor cells acquire

incubation time, PRMT1 enzyme concentration, and SAM
concentration, respectively (Figs. 4a, 4b and 4c). Next, the
136 candidates were tested using the screening system.
Five compounds were found to inhibit PRMT1 activity,
including rutin, isoquercitrin, salvianolic acid A (SAA),
naproxen, and felodipline. The suppression multiples of
the five compounds were shown in Figure 4d, and the
result of rescreening is shown in Fig. 4e. Moreover, AMI-1
significantly inhibited the activity of PRMT1 as expected.

Screening of PRMT1 inhibitors
Previous studies have shown that AMI-1 decreased
P-gp expression in resistant cells and increased their
sensitivity to adriamycin. Hence, PRMT1 seemed to be an
effective target for overcoming tumor MDR. In order to
identify additional PRMT1 inhibitors, a high-throughput
drug-screening platform was developed to screen 136
candidates, including 63 traditional Chinese medicine
monomers and 73 chemical drugs.
Preliminary experiments were carried out to
determine the optimal reaction condition, and the results
indicated that 6 h, 3.87 ng/μL and 6 μM were the suitable

The MTT assay [33] in HEK 293T cells indicated
that cell viabilities were above 90% when exposed to 5 to

A significantly suppressed tumor growth (Figures 6a and

20 to 100 μM) of rutin, isoquercitrin, and felodipline (data
not given). The cell viabilities ranged from 90% to 120%
when the concentration was reduced to between 1 and 12
μM (Figure 5b). To improve consistency, 10 μM of AMI1 and the five compounds were used to test the effect on
MDR1 promoter activity. As showed in Figure 5c, a 50:1
ratio of pLG3-P-gp to PRL-TK vector seemes to be optimal.
The results of luciferase assay indicated that naproxen,
SAA, rutin, isoquercitrin, and felodipline all inhibited the
promoter activity to different degrees (Figure 5d).

DISCUSSION

PRMT1 inhibitors enhanced the antitumor effect
of adriamycin in nude mice bearing resistant
breast cancer

As a ligand-dependent nuclear receptor, PXR
stimulate gene transcription by directly binding to the
DNA after being activated by the appropriate ligand.
However, it is difficult for PXR to get the target regions
in DNA due to the specific and dense structure of

chromosomes. The methylation of histone H4R3, which
is catalyzed by PRMT1, is an early promoter event and
the beginning of a series of epigenetic modifications
during the activation of genes [17]. Previous studies
suggest that PRMT1 increases the transcription of PXR
responsive gene CYP3A4, and small interfering RNA
(siRNA) knockdown or gene deletion of PRMT1 greatly
diminishes CYP3A4 expression [34–36]. It is likely that
the epigenetic modifications make the dense chromosome
structure loose, which helps PXR to arrive at the target
regions and facilitates the initiation of transcription. Thus,
we hypothesized that PRMT1 acts as a transcriptional
co-activator of PXR and plays a role in acquired
overexpression of MDR1 in resistant cells. We propose
that acquired MDR1 overexpression in tumor cells may
be activated by PXR through a tripartite mechanism.
First, antineoplastic agents, which serve as exogenous
PXR ligands, bind to the PXR and result in allostery of

PXR. Then, the PRMT1 binding site on PXR is exposed.
Second, PRMT1 is recruited to bind with PXR. PRMT1
methylate histone H4R3 of MDR1 gene, which start
the epigenetic modifications and make the chromosome
structure loose. Third, PXR-co-activator complex binds
to the target region on MDR1 promoter and initiates
transcription of MDR1gene.
In the present study, AMI-1 was used to
pharmacologically block PRMT1. Our data showed
that inhibition of PRMT1 significantly decreased the
expression of P-gp in MCF7/adr cells and increased
their sensitivity to antitumor agents. The subcellular
localization of PRMT1 is highly consistent with PXR in
resistant breast cancer cells, and the physical interaction
exists between the two proteins. After pharmacologically
block PRMT1 by AMI-1, the interaction between PXR
and PRMT1 were disrupted, and the expression of P-gp
decreased. Hence, we speculate that AMI-1 decrease

MATERIALS AND METHODS

P-gp expression by disrupting the interaction between
PXR and PRMT1. Remarkably, we found that MDR1
overexpression was maintained for at least four weeks
after removing adriamycin. Consistently, physical
interactions between PXR and PRMT1 still exist on
the 28th day after removing adriamycin. Therefore, it
is likly that PRMT1 acts as an endogenous agonist of
PXR, which maintains transcriptional activity of PXR on
MDR1 gene after removing the exogenous PXR ligands.
Then, we investigated the effect of PRMT1 inhibitors on
P-gp promoter activity in vitro, and the result showed
P-gp promoter activity were greatly diminished. Also, in
vivo study indicated that AMI-1, naproxen, and SAA all
enhanced the antitumor effect of adriamycin in nude mice
bearing resistant breast cancer.
Moreover, we first identified rutin, isoquercitrin,
salvianolic acid A, naproxen and felodipline as PRMT1
inhibitors by screening 136 candidates. The result
of MTT assay showed that all the five compounds
increased the sensitivity of MCF7/adr cells to adriamycin
to some extent (supplementary material 4). Among
those candidates, 16 traditional Chinese medicine
monomers (including glycyrrhetinic acid, tetrandrine,
tetramethylpyrazine
hydrochloride,
ginsenoside
Re, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb, panaxadiol,
panaxatriol, isoquercitrin, capsaicin, baicalein, quercetin,
baicalin, curcumin, piperine and citronella ) and 10
chemical drugs (cyclosporine, amiodarone, reserpine,
7-hydroxycoumarin, 7-methyl-coumarin, felodipine,
nimodipine, propafenone, verapamil and hymecromone)
were previously reported to be P-gp inhibitors [37–45].
However, except for isoquercitrin and felodipine, none
of those compounds inhibited PRMT1, which suggests
that those 24 compounds may inhibit P-gp though other
mechanisms. Both isoquercitrin and rutin are flavonoids
and have the same aglycone (supplementary material 5).
Interestingly, quercetin, which also has the same aglycone
but not glycosylated, did not inhibit PRMT1. In addition,
previous studies [46, 47] reported that in vitro exposure to
salvianolic acid A and naproxen decreased the expression
and the efflux function of P-gp though the underling
mechanism still unclear. Another study [48] reported that
exposure to felodipline decrease the expression of BCRP,
which is another PXR responsive gene. It is possible that
those drugs suppress the expression of P-gp and BCRP via
inhibition of PRMT1.
In conclusion, we have proposed a possibility
that PRMT1 may be an important co-activator of PXR
in activating MDR1 gene during acquired resistance.
Antitumor agents combined with a PRMT1 inhibitor may
be an effective strategy for overcoming tumor MDR.
However, risks may exist when using PRMT1 inhibitors,
since PRMT1 play a crucial role in a wide range of
physiological and pathological processes [49–50], and
further investigations are needed.

Cell lines and drugs
The human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, and the
adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cell line, MCF7/adr,
were obtained from Shanghai Institutes for Biological
Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SIBS, CAS,
Shanghai, China) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
(Gibco, New York, NY, USA) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK293T cells were supplied by
the same institute and were cultured in DMEM medium.
RPMI 1640 and DMEM medium were supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT,
USA), 1% nonessential amino acid, 1% glutamine, 1%
penicillin and streptomycin. The medium for MCF7/adr
cells was additionally supplemented with adriamycin
to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL to maintain their
resistance. MCF7/adr cells were cultured in drug-free
medium for 2 weeks before the assay. Adriamycin was
purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Sigma, Louis, MO,
USA), and AMI-1 was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,
USA).

Reverse transcription PCR and real-time
PCR analyses
Total RNA was extracted from cells and tissue
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY,
USA). Reverse transcription was performed with 2 μg
of total RNA using the RevertAidTM First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The resulting cDNA was subsequently amplified using
the TakaRa PCR amplification Kit (TakaRa, Kyoto,
Japan). The parameters for PCR were as follows: one
denaturing cycle at 94°C for 3 min, 35 amplification
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 20 s and 72°C for 30 s,
one extension cycle of 72°C for 10 min. All products were
electrophoresed on 1.5% standard agarose gels that were
subsequently stained with ethidium bromide and images
were obtained with a gel imaging system (Lingcheng
Biological Science and Technology Co Ltd, Shanghai,
China).
For real-time PCR, Bestar® SybrGreen qPCR
Mastermix (DBI® Bioscience, Ludwigshafen, Germany)
was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequences of real-time PCR primers were designed by
Primer Express software v 3.0 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) and were analyzed with BLAST in
GenBank database to exclude homology with other genes.
The mRNA level was normalized to GAPDH mRNA
expression in each sample individually. All primers for
reverse transcription PCR and real-time PCR are shown
in supplementary material 1.

Western blotting analysis

for 15 min at 4°C, supernatant fractions were collected and
transferred into three tubes prepared as IP sample, negative
control, and input control. The supernatant prepared for
IP sample was incubated with anti-PRMT1 antibodies
(Cell Signaling Technology Inc, Beverly, MA, USA)
overnight at 4°C, and then with Protein A + G agarose
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) for 2 h at 4°C on a
rotary shaker. Corresponding isotype IgG was used instead
of anti-PRMT1 antibodies to prepare the supernatant for
the negative control. The beads were washed three times
and boiled for 10 min with the indicated percentage of
loading buffer (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), and
the supernatant for the input control was also boiled under
the same condition. The precipitated protein complexes
and the input sample were then analyzed by western blot
with anti-PRMT1 and anti-PXR antibodies (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA).

Total proteins were extracted from cells and tissue
using RIPA Lysis Buffer (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) supplemented with 1% PMSF (Sigma). The
concentration of the protein samples was determined
and standardized using the BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Thirty micrograms of each
lysate was electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE on 10% SDS
gels, and then were transferred onto a PVDF membrane.
After over 1 h of blocking in 5% milk with TBST buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCL, 137 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, pH
7.6), the membrane was incubated with the appropriate
primary antibodies of P-gp (Cell Signaling Technology
Inc, Beverly, MA, USA), PXR (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA) and PRMT1 (Cell Signaling Technology
Inc, Beverly, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight. Then, the
membrane was washed with TBST buffer for 3 times (10
min each time), and incubated with the corresponding
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000) for
1 h at 37°C. The membrane was washed again, 3 times
with TBST and twice with TBS (10 min each time), and
then was exposed to Immobilon Western Chemilum Hrp
Substrate (Millipore, Boston, MA, USA). Finally, protein
concentration was estimated relative to β-actin (for PXR
and P-gp) or tubulin (for PRMT1) using WCIF Image J
Software [24].

Cytotoxicity assay
A modified MTT assay [25] was used to detect the
cytotoxicity of adriamycin in MCF7, MCF7/adr, and
AMI-1 pretreated MCF7/adr cells. Cells were seeded
in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY,
USA) at a density of 1×104 cells per well and incubated
first for 24 h in RPMI 1640 complete medium (Gibco,
New York, NY, USA), then in medium containing 100
– 0.001 μM of adriamycin for another 48 h. Untreated
control cells were included. Subsequently, 10 μL of 5
mg/mL of MTT (Sigma, Louis, MO, USA) was added
to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for
4 h. Then, the media in each well was discarded and
100 μL of DMSO (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA) was
added to solubilize the purple blue formazan. After the
incubation at 37°C for10 min, absorbance at 570 nm of
the dissolved solutions was measured using a Multiskan
MK 3 Microplate Reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). All tests and analyses were performed
in triplicate. Cell viability was calculated as the
percentage of the control value. A graph of percentage
of cell viability versus concentrations of adriamycin was
plotted and used to calculate the IC50.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100 (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA) for 10 min on ice.
After over 3 h of blocking in 10% donkey serum (EY
laboratories, San Mateo, CA, USA) with phosphate buffer
saline (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China), anti-PXR (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-Prmt1 (Cell Signaling
Technology Inc, Beverly, MA, USA) antibodies were
added to the blocking solution at a dilution of 1:50 and
1:100, respectively, and incubated overnight at 4°C.
Subsequently, cells were incubated with TRITC and FITC
tagged secondary antibodies (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China)
for 1 h at 25°C. After being washed three times (10 min
each time), 1mg/mL of DAPI (Sigma, Louis, MO, USA)
was used to stain the nuclear DNA. Finally, cells were
analyzed and images were obtained using an inverted
fluorescence microscope (Leica, Hessen, Germany).

Screening of PRMT1 inhibitors
The Transzyme HMT PRMT1 Assay Kit (catalog
# 9014, Bellbrook labs, Madison, WI, USA) was
used to screen for PRMT1 inhibitors according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In black 384-well microplates,
15 μL of the reaction mixture, which consisted of the
indicated percentage of HMT PRMT1 enzyme, H4
Peptide (1-20), S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), HMT
enzyme buffer, and DEPC-treated H2O, plus 2.5 μL of
the candidate drug solution (100 μM in DMSO) was
added to each well. Then, fluorescence polarization was

Co-immunoprecipitation
Cells were washed twice with PBS and homogenized
in the cell lysis buffer for western and IP (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA). PMSF was added immediately
before to the lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 12,000 g

detected using a Synergy H1 Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek,
Winooski, VT, USA). The filters and dichroic mirror used
were Ex 620/40 nm, Em 680/30 nm and 660 nm mirror.
The reaction system was optimized in a preliminary
experiment to determine the optimal concentrations of the
PRMT1 enzyme and SAM, and the optimal incubation
time. An equal volume of DEPC-treated H2O and DMSO
were used to replace the candidate drug solution and
served as the no inhibitor and vehicle control, respectively.
AMI-1 was used as the positive control. The fluorescence
polarization produced by the o inhibitor control + 3
standard deviations (SD) was set as screening criteria. The
sources of 136 candidates are shown in the supplementary
material 2. The suppression multiples were calculated
using the fluorescence polarization produced by test drugs
divided by the fluorescence polarization produced by the
no inhibitor control.

Female BALB/c nude mice (4 weeks of age)
were purchased from the Shuo Da Animal Center
(Shuo Da, Chengdu, China) and fed in the Laboratory
Animal Center of the West China University of Medical
Science (Chengdu, China). All animal experiments were
performed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan
University.
The resistant breast cancer model was established
by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 mL of MCF7/adr cells
at a density of 1×107 /mL into the right upper flanks of
BALB/c nude mice. Antitumor activities of naproxen
or Salvianolic acid A, combined with adriamycin, were
determined in mice bearing the resistant breast cancer.
Mice bearing nonresistant breast cancer were obtained by
injection of MCF7 cells and served as the control group.
The mice were divided into nine groups and subjected to
antitumor treatment when the tumor diameter reached 0.5
cm (about 15 days after inoculation). MCF7-bearing mice
were treated with saline (0.2 mL, intraperitoneal injection,
once every four days). Eight groups of MCF7/adr-bearing
mice (n=6 per group) were respectively treated with saline
(0.2 mL, intraperitoneal injection, once every four days),
adriamycin (8 mg/ kg, intraperitoneal injection, once every
four days), adriamycin (as mentioned above) + 0.5%
CMC-Na (0.2 mL, intraperitoneal injection, once a day),
adriamycin (as mentioned above) + AMI-1 (1.575 mg/kg
[26], intraperitoneal injection, once a day), adriamycin
(as mentioned above) + naproxen (20 or 5 mg/kg [27],
intraperitoneal injection, once a day) or adriamycin (as
mentioned above) + Salvianolic acid A (30 or 10 mg/
kg [28, 29], intraperitoneal injection, once a day) for 21
consecutive days. Tumor size and mice body weights were
measured on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, and 21
after treatment. The tumor volume was estimated using
the formula:
Volume (V) = 0.5×a×b2
where a, b are the shorter and longer diameters of
the tumors, respectively.
Twenty-four hours after the last administration, mice
were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the tumors
were stripped. Tumor tissues were collected and stored in
liquid nitrogen for future detection of P-gp expression.

Plasmid construction and luciferase
reporter assay
The MDR1 promoter fragment was amplified by
PCR using the following primers: 5’-CCGCTCGAGTA
TGTTAAAGAATTACTTCATCCCCA-3’ (Forward) and
5’- CCCAAGCTTCTTACCTTTTATCTGGTTGCTTCC
TGA-3’ (Reverse). Then, the PCR product was analyzed
by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the target product
(1278 bp) was extracted and cloned into the pGL3-Basic
vector (4818 bp) between the XhoI and Hind III sites. The
sequence of the inserted gene fragment can be found at
the supplementary material 3. The cloned products were
confirmed by final sequencing.
HEK293T cells (SIBS, CAS, Shanghai, China) were
simultaneously transfected with pGL3-PGP-Basic plasmid
and PRL-TK vector, which contains a gene encoding the
Renilla luciferase and served as the control. Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) was used
to transfect the cells according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Five hours after transfection, cells were replaced
with new medium and treated with 10 mM of AMI-1,
naproxen, SAA, rutin, isoquercitrin, or felodipline for 24
h respectively. Cells were then collected and lysed, and
luciferase activity was measured and analyzed using the
Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Beyotime,
Shanghai, China) with the SynergyTM HT Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The
luminescence of cell lysates was used as the blank control.
The relative light unit (RLU) was calculated to reflect
the activity of the MDR1 promoter using the following
formula:

Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± SD.
Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using the
software SPSS (version 10.0, Chicago, IL, USA). Means
were compared using one-way analysis of variance

RLU = (LpGL3-PGP-Basic –LBlank) / (LPRL-TK-LBlank)
where L is the luminescence that was detected in
each group.
