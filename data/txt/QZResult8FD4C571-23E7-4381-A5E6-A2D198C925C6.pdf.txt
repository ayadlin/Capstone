ABSTRACT
Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, has
demonstrated clinical benefits for women with HER2-positive breast cancer; however,
trastuzumab resistance remains the biggest clinical challenge. In this study, results
showed that tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, synergistically enhanced
the antitumor activity of trastuzumab against HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Combined treatment of
tunicamycin with trastuzumab dramatically decreased the expression of EGFR family
and its down signaling pathway in SKBR3 and MCF-7/HER2 cells. Tunicamycin
dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in both of SKBR3 xenografts and MCF7/HER2 xenografts. Optimal tunicamycin without inducing ER stress in liver tissue
significantly increased the antitumor effect of trastuzumab in MCF-7/HER2 xenografts.
Combinations of trastuzumab with N-glycosylation inhibitors tunicamycin may be a
promising approach for improving clinical efficacy of trastuzumab.

mechanisms of the antitumor activity of trastuzumab
mainly include prevention of HER2-receptor dimerization,
increased endocytotic destruction of the receptor, inhibi­
tion of shedding of the extracellular domain, and activa­
tion of immune response through antibody-dependent
cellularcytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC) [6, 7].
Trastuzumab has significantly improved outcomes
for patients with HER2- overexpressing breast cancer;
however, innate and acquired trastuzumab resistance has
increasingly occurred and remains the biggest clinical
challenge. Many patients with HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer either do not respond to initial therapy
or develop acquired resistance to trastuzumab within
one year. Because the HER2 signaling pathway is a
complex biological network, inhibition of the HER2
oncogenic pathway with trastuzumab may result in
compensatory crosstalk and activation of alternative
signaling pathways, which contribute to the trastuzumab
resistance. EGFR and HER3 overexpression might be
responsible for acquired resistance to trastuzumab [8].
EGFR and HER3 expression is substantially increased

INTRODUCTION
HER2 (also named as ErbB2) is a member of the
EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, which also
include EGFR, HER3, and HER4. HER2 is activated
by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with
other EGFR receptors. HER2 is generally regarded as
the preferred heterodimerization partner for each of the
ligand-bound EGFR receptors [1]. Two key signaling
pathways activated by the EGFR family dimers are the
MAPK pathway, which stimulates proliferation, and the
PI3K/Akt pathway, which promotes tumour cell survival.
The PI3K/Akt pathway is the predominant oncogenic
pathway downstream of HER2 [2]. HER2 plays important
roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation in a
complex manner. HER2 is overexpressed in 25–30% of
human breast cancers and its overexpression is associated
with more aggressive disease behavior and poor response
to chemotherapy [3–5].
Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets
the HER2 extracellular domain, induces uncoupling
of heterodimers, and inhibits downstream signaling. The

after long-term trastuzumab exposure of breast cancer
cell lines to trastuzumab [8]. Trastuzumab has been
found to abrogate ligand-induced EGFR-HER2 binding
and ligand-independent HER2-HER3 association;
however, trastuzumab treatment has only a minor
effect on ligand-induced HER2-HER3 dimerization [9,
10]. Activated PI3K/Akt pathway also induces strong
trastuzumab resistance [11]. The knowledge of these
mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance has driven
the development of new drugs or drug combinations.
Trastuzumab has widely been used clinically in
combination with docetaxel, carboplatin or capecitabine
in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and
gastric cancer [12–14]. Combining trastuzumab with one
or two chemotherapy drugs yields better response rate
than single agent probably due to their complementary
mechanisms of action. Therefore, a therapeutic strategy
that disrupts signaling from multiple RTKs may have the
potential advantage of blocking both the primary and
the compensatory signaling mechanisms that have been
shown to contribute to trastuzumab resistance.
N-linked glycosylation (NLG) is a highly
regulated and critical step in the maturation of
transmembrane RTK glycoproteins. Tunicamycin,
a nucleoside antibiotic, inhibits the first step in the
biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides in cells.
Consequently, the glycoproteins are not folded
and cause an accumulation of mis- or unfolded
glycoproteins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER),
resulting in the ER stress induction and apoptotic
cell death [15, 16]. Previous reports have shown that
disruption of N-linked glycosylation could reduce
protein levels of RTK and downstream signaling
pathway, suggesting that inhibition of NLG with
tunicamycin is an alternative mechanistic approach to
reduce both oncogenic signaling and the mechanisms
of therapeutic resistance [17]. NLG inhibition produced
marked radiosensitization in cancer cell lines but did not
radiosensitize nontransformed cells [18]. Tunicamycin
has been shown to enhance the susceptibility of
lung cancer cells and sensitize resistant cell lines to
Erlotinib [19]. Tunicamycin sensitizes human prostate
cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by increased
expression of DR5 protein [20]. Tunicamycin also
potentiate cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in human
cell lines [21]. Tunicamycin inhibits angiogenesis in
nude mice by decreasing VEGF expression [22]. All
these reports have confirmed that tunicamycin-induced
disruption of NLG has a considerable advantage by
both targeting multiple receptor types and sensitizing
cancer cells to antitumor drugs.
Trastuzumab resistance pathways are multiple,
interconnected and autonomous. Tunicamycin can
inhibit N-glycosylated receptors and downstream
signaling pathways. In this report, we test the antitumor
activity of tunicamycin alone and in combination with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

trastuzumab on breast cancer cells with low or high
HER2 expression. We also found out the optimal dose
of tunicamycin which can inhibit N-glycosylation and
decrease RTK expression without causing toxicity. We
proposed that inhibition of the N-glycan biosynthesis
by tunicamycin may be a promising therapeutic
strategy for enhancing the sensitivity of cancer cells to
trastuzumab.

RESULTS
Effect of tunicamycin and trastuzumab
combination on the proliferation of breast
cancer cells
In order to investigate whether tunicamycin
inhibit growth against tumor cell lines as the same
manner as in normal cell lines, SRB assay was
performed in several breast cancer cell lines as well
as in some normal cell lines such as MCF-10A,
HL7702, HEK293T, HMLE and HUVEC. As shown in
Figure 1, exposure to tunicamycin for 96 h at various
concentrations ranging from 0.125 μg/ml to 4 μg/ml
resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth
in all tested cell lines. Tunicamycin-induced growth
inhibition was not dependent on HER2 expression
levels in breast cancer cells. The cytotoxicity produced
by tunicamycin in breast cancer cells was similar to
that in normal cells. Normal breast cells MCF-10A
was most sensitive to tunicamycin; however, normal
hepatocyte cells HL7702 was more resistant to it
(Figure 1A). To investigate the effects of combined
treatment of tunicamycin with trastuzumab on cell
growth, we used low HER2-expressing breast cancer
cells MCF-7 and HER2-overexpressing cells such as
MCF-7/HER2, SKBR3, MDA-MB-453 and BT-474.
The expression levels of EGFR family in these cell
lines were shown in Figure 1B. In agreement with
previous reports, trastuzumab inhibited proliferation of
HER2-overexpressing MCF-7/HER2, SKBR3, MDAMB-453 and BT-474 cells. In HER2-overexpressing
cells, treatment with this drug combination resulted in
a significant growth inhibitory effect when compared
with the drug being added alone (Figure 1C). In
MCF-7 cells, that were resistant to trastuzumab,
combination treatments did not dramatically enhance
the effect of the individual drug treatments (Figure
1C). In order to determine the enhanced effects are
additive or synergistic, drug interaction was analyzed
by the CalcuSyn Software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK)
and expressed as combination index (CI). As shown
in Figure 1C and Table 1, the results indicated that
tunicamycin and trastuzumab synergistically inhibited
cell growth in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cell lines.

combination on cell cycle

Effect of tunicamycin and trastuzumab
combination on cell signaling pathways

Flow cytometry analysis was performed after
cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of
individual or combination drugs for 24 h. Results showed
that tunicamycin alone induced G0/G1 arrest with a dosedependent manner in MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3
cells (Figure 2A). As reported previously, trastuzumab also
increased the population of cells at G0/G1 phase in MCF7/HER2 and SKBR3 cells; however, trastuzumab did not
induce cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells. Compared with
individual treatment, the combined treatment of 1.0 μg/
ml tunicamycin with 10 μg/ml trastuzumab dramatically
enhanced the G0/G1 arrest in MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3
cells, but not in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2B). Above results
demonstrated that enhanced growth inhibitory effect of
combined treatment in HER2-overexpressing cancer cells
was partly due to the increased G0/G1 arrest.

To investigate the mechanism responsible for the
enhanced growth inhibition of the combination treatment
of tunicamycin with trastuzumab, we investigated the
signal transduction pathways correlated to EGFR family,
ER stress, cell cycle and apoptosis.
Tunicamycin disrupted the protein expression
and phosphorylation levels of EGFR, HER2 and HER3
in a dose-dependent manner in MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2
and SKBR3 cells. Tunicamycin treatment produced full
sized EGFR and smaller molecular EGFR in three breast
cancer cell lines. Similarly, full sized HER2 and smaller
molecular HER2 were also observed after tunicamycin
treatment with varying concentrations in breast cancer
cells, indicating that tunicamycin induced unglycosylated
EGFR and HER2. Tunicamycin-induced disruption of
Erk1/2 and Akt were also accompanied with a decrease
of their phosphorylation levels (Figure 4A). As previous
reports, trastuzumab inhibited the HER2, Erk1/2 and Akt
phosphorylation in MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3 cells, not in
MCF-7 cells (Figure 4B). As shown in Figure 4B, the fixed
dose of tunicamycin at 1.0 μg/ml significantly enhanced
trastuzumab-induced decreases of EGFR, HER2, HER3,
Erk1/2 and Akt, as well as their phosphorylation levels in
MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3 cells, suggesting that MAPK
and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were greatly inhibited
by the combination of tunicamycin and trastuzumab in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.
We next examined the expression of cell-cycle
regulators, such as cyclin D1 and cyclin dependent
kinase inhibitor p27, which are essential for G1/S phase
progression, in breast cancer cells treated with trastuzumab.
Tunicamycin treatment resulted in concentrationdependent increase of p27 and decrease of cyclin D1 in

Effect of tunicamycin and trastuzumab
combination on apoptosis
Annexin V-FITC/PI analysis was used to examine
the percentage of apoptosis in MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2
and SKBR3 cells following treatment with tunicamycin,
trastuzumab, or their combination for 24 h. Tunicamycin
treatment alone induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent
manner (data not shown). Trastuzumab treatment
alone slightly improved apoptotic cells in MCF-7/
HER2 and SKBR3 cells. As shown in Figure 3, the
combination of tunicamycin (1.0 μg/ml) with trastuzumab
(10 μg/ml) resulted in significant increases in the
percentage of apoptotic cells as compared with either
tunicamycin or trastuzumab treatment alone in MCF-7/
HER2 and SKBR3 cells (Figure 3).

all three breast cancer cells (Figure 4A). Trastuzumab
alone also enhanced p27 expression with no affection on
cyclin D1 expression in MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3 cells.
The protein level of p27 was significantly increased in
response to the combination treatment of tunicamycin and
trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. The
same changes were not found in MCF-7 cells with lower
HER2-expression (Figure 4B). We examined whether low
doses of tunicamycin with a little cytotoxicity would cause
ER stress. As shown in Figure 4A, tunicamycin treatment
alone obviously enhanced the expressions of CHOP and
GRP78 in MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3 cells. Above
results showed that ER stress induced by tunicamycin may
contribute to the growth inhibitory effects of tunicamycin.
Tunicamycin dose-dependently increased the expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of activated caspase 3 and inactivated PARP in three cell
lines; however, combined treatment obviously enhanced
the expression of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP
as compared with the treatment of either drug alone in
MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3 cells (Figure 4A and 4B).

Effect of tunicamycin and trastuzumab
combination on tumor growth in vivo
Tunicamycin has broad, non-specific effects on
all N-linked glycoproteins, so tunicamycin-induced
N-glycosylation inhibition may produce systemic side
effects. In order to explore a suitable dose of tunicamycin
for treatment of tumor in vivo, we determined the antitumor
activity of tunicamycin alone in nude mice bearing SKBR3

and MCF-7/HER2 cancer cells xenografts, respectively.
Firstly, tunicamycin was injected intravenously twice a
week for 3 weeks at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg and
1.2 mg/kg in SKBR3 xenografts, respectively. However,
all nude mice treated with tunicamycin died on days 17 for
0.3 mg/kg group, on days 15 for 0.6 mg/kg group and on
days 11 for 1.2 mg/kg group, respectively. Tunicamycininduced toxicity was dose-dependent; indicating that high
dose of tunicamycin would cause systemic side effects. So
we decreased the dose of tunicamycin to treat nude mice
bearing SKBR3 xenografts again. Result showed that
tunicamycin treatment at the dose of 0.005 mg/kg, 0.02
mg/kg and 0.08 mg/kg decreased tumor growth by 12.9%,
29.1% and 41.6% in SKBR3 xenografts, respectively
(Figure 5A). We then repeated the effect of tunicamycin
with the same doses on tumor growth in MCF-7/HER2
xenograft-bearing nude mice. As shown in Figure 5C,
tunicamycin inhibited tumor growth by 21.9%, 32.5%
and 50.4% in MCF-7/HER2 xenograft at the dose of
0.005 mg/kg, 0.02 mg/kg and 0.08 mg/kg, respectively.

Tunicamycin treatment at the dose of 0.02 mg/kg and
0.005 mg/kg did not lead to any signs of abnormal behavior
and significant weight loses in both xenograft mice
bearing SKBR3 and MCF-7/HER2 cells (Figure 5B, 5D).
However, the dose of 0.08 mg/kg tunicamycin caused
dramatically weight loses in both xenograft mice.
Histological analysis was also used to examine whether
tunicamycin produced hepatocyte death. The results
showed that the treatment of 0.08 mg/kg tunicamycin for
3 weeks resulted in lobular and portal inflammation in
liver; however, hepatocytes were similar to normal when
mice bearing MCF-7/HER2 were treated with tunicamycin
at the dose of 0.005 and 0.02 mg/kg (Figure 5E),
suggesting tunicamycin at 0.02 mg/kg was the optimal
dose which did not result in significant side effects in mice.
We then tested whether 0.02 mg/kg tunicamycin
treatment could decrease the expression of EGFR
family and induce ER stress in tumor and in liver
tissues. Tumor and liver tissues were dissected from
the MCF-7/HER2 xenograft treated with or without

0.02 mg/kg tunicamycin. Four samples from each group
were selected for western blot analysis. Compared
with control group, tunicamycin apparently disrupted
the expression of EGFR, HER2 and HER3, as well as
the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways in tumor samples
(Figure 6A). GRP78 and CHOP, the hallmark of ER
stress, were examined by western blot analysis. 0.02 mg/
kg tunicamycin significantly increased GRP78 expression
level in tumor; however, CHOP expression was not
affected by tunicamycin treatment (Figure 6A). Notably,
tunicamycin did not dramatically alter the expression
of EGFR family and its downstream signaling pathway,
as well as the GRP78 and CHOP level in liver tissue,
demonstrating that tunicamycin at the dose of 0.02
mg/kg would not produce N-glycosylation inhibition and
ER stress in normal tissue (Figure 6B).

We then chose the dose of 0.02 mg/kg for next
combined treatment in nude mice, because this dose can
decrease the expression of EGFR family without causing
any side effects on mice. Compared with the control
group, the group of 0.02 mg/kg tunicamycin, 10 mg/kg
trastuzumab and the combination treatment inhibited tumor
growth by 24.6%, 50.7% and 77.2% in MCF-7/HER2
xenograft, respectively (Figure 7A). The combined therapy
of tunicamycin with trastuzumab resulted in a significant
reduction of tumor volume when compared with either
tunicamycin or trastuzumab alone in nude mice bearing
MCF-7/HER2 xenograft. The average weight of mice
among the four groups was similar, demonstrating that all
treatment were safe without producing toxicity (Figure 7B).

apoptosis in vivo. Apoptotic cells were found in all tumor

human cells. The results of SRB assay indicated that
tunicamycin inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent
manner in breast cancer cells, as well as in normal
human cells. No significant difference with IC50 values
was found among breast cancer cells with low HER2expressing cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and with
high HER2-expressing cells MCF-7/HER2, SKBR3,
MDA-MB-453 and BT-474 cells, demonstrating that
the growth inhibitory effect of tunicamycin was not
depended on HER2 expression levels. Similar growth
inhibitory effects were observed in normal human cells
as that in breast cancer cells, indicating that side-effects
produced by tunicamycin should be considered when
tunicamycin is used to treat cancer in vivo. The effects
of combined treatment of tunicamycin with trastuzumab
on cell growth were tested in breast cells with low
or high HER2 expression. The results demonstrated
that tunicamycin synergistically potentiated growth
inhibition of trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells.
In agreement with previous reports, we also con­
firmed that tunicamycin or trastuzumab alone induced
cells at G0/G1 arrest in HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells. Compared with individual drug, the combined
treatment of tunicamycin with trastuzumab enhanced
G0/G1 arrest in MCF-7/HER2 cells and SKBR3 cells,
but not in MCF-7 cells. Preclinical studies suggest that
trastuzamab increases cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase via

DISCUSSION
Trastuzumab has significantly improved outcome
and remains the standard treatment in patients with
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer; however, primary or
acquired resistance to trastuzumab has been increasingly
recognized as a major obstacle in the clinical management
of this disease. Multiple and cross-talk pathways are
involved in trastuzumab resistance which limit the clinical
outcome. Multiple mechanisms may act simultaneously to
confer resistance to the drug, so it is clinically unfeasible to
extensively combine various therapeutic targets. However,
it is a strategy to find out a multiple RTK inhibitor to
increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to trastuzumab.
Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation, has
been reported to abrogate RTK expression including EGFR
family. In this study, we investigated whether tunicamycin
could enhance the antitumor effects of trastuzumab against
breast cancer in vitro and in vivo.

increasing the protein levels of p27, a cyclin dependent
kinase inhibitor. Exogenous addition of p27 increased
trastuzumab sensitivity [23]. Decreased p27 protein level
has been associated with trastuzumab resistance and with
poor prognosis in breast cancer cells [23]. In this study,
tunicamycin or trastuzumab alone increased p27 protein
level; however, the combined treatment of both drugs
dramatically increased p27 expression as compared with
individual treatment in HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells. Cyclin D1 promotes the transition from G1
to S phase by binding to Cdk4. In this report, tunicamycin
decreased cyclin D1 dose-dependently and trastuzumab did
not resulted any changes of cyclin D1 expression; however,
cyclin D1 expression levels were decreased obviously with
the increasing concentrations of trastuzumab after combined
treatment of trastuzumab with 1.0 μg/ml tunicamycin in
HER2-overexpressing cells. These results demonstrated that
tunicamycin increased trastuzumab-induced G0/G1 arrest
through an increase of p27 expression and a decrease of
cyclin D1 expression in MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3 cells.
The most well-known effect of trastuzumab is the
inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, which
lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression
of cell proliferation. The alternative elevations of other
tyrosine kinase receptors and the activation of MAPK
and PI3K/Akt pathways have been associated with
trastuzumab resistance [11]. HER2-HER3 heterodimers is
considered the most active EGFR family signalling dimer
[24, 25]. However, trastuzumab has only a minor effect
on ligand-induced HER2-HER3 dimerization [9, 10].
Previous reports have demonstrated that tuncamycin
decreased EGFR expression through blocking EGFR
maturation and its transportation from the ER to the
cell membrane [17, 19]. In this study, the combined
treatment of tunicamycin with trastuzumab significantly
decreased EGFR, HER2 and HER3 protein and their
phosphorylation levels compared with individual treatment
in HER2-overexpressing cells MCF-7/HER2 and SKBR3.
Tunicamycin also decreased the protein levels of Akt,
Erk1/2 and their phosphorylation levels. The combination
treatment greatly enhanced the decrease of phosphorylated
Akt and phosphorylated Erk1/2, as well as Akt and Erk1/2
protein levels. These results indicated that combined
treatment elevated the disruption of EGFR receptor family
and its downstream pathways such as MAPK and PI3K/
Akt, which improved the sensitivity of breast cancer cells
to trastuzumab.
Tunicamycin inhibited biosynthetic process of
protein N-glycosylation, which may cause ER stress
and toxicity in normal tissues. In this report, in order to
answer a fundamental question of whether a low dose of
tunicamycin can disrupt N-glycosylation without toxicity
to normal cells, the ER stress induced by tunicamycin
was examined in vitro and in vivo. ER stress is modulated
mainly by the ER chaperone GRP78, also known as
binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), which is involved
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in protein folding and in protein translocation [26]. CHOP,
also called GADD153, is primarily pro-apoptotic and
is one of the highly inducible genes during ER stress.
Pro-survival GRP78 and pro-apoptotic CHOP are key
opposing representatives of ER stress response [26]. In
this report, both of GRP78 and CHOP protein levels were
increased after treatment with tunicamycin in all tested
cells including breast cancer cell lines and human normal
cell lines (data not shown), indicating that tunicamycininduced ER stress was not cell-type specific.
Many studies have reported the toxicity of
tunicamycin in vivo. Cattle, sheep and pigs displayed clinical
sensitivity to tunicamycin in the oral dose range of 0.5 to
1.0 mg/kg body weight; furthermore, a total cumulative
oral dose of only 1 mg/kg was potentially lethal [27].
When mice were administered as a single intraperitoneal
injection, the LD50 and LD100 of tunicamycin were 2.0 mg/
kg and 3.5 mg/kg, respectively [28]. Some rats survived
with daily subcutaneous injections of 50 μg/kg tunicamycin
for up to 31 days [29]. Tunicamycin administered as a
single subcutaneous dose of 200 μg/kg caused permanent
destruction of seminiferous tubules in adult male rats [30].
Based on above data, nude mice involved in this study
were firstly treated with tunicamycin at the doses of 0.3,
0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg body weight, respectively. However, all
tunicamycin-treated mice died around two weeks. We then
decreased the doses of tunicamycin in the following animal
experiments. Nude mice bearing SKBR3 and MCF-7/HER2
xenograft were then treated with tunicamycin at the doses
of 0.005 mg/kg, 0.02 mg/kg and 0.08 mg/kg, respectively.
All doses inhibited tumor growth dose-dependently in
both xenograft models; however, 0.08 mg/kg tunicamycin
showed apparent totoxicity along with decreased weights.
Compared with control group, 0.02 mg/kg tunicamycin
inhibited tumor growth by 29.1% in SKBR3 xenograft and
by 32.5% in MCF-7/HER2 xenograft without any signs of
totoxicity. The mice treated with 0.005 mg/kg tunicamycin
also showed no sign of abnormal behavior. A lots of papers
indicated that tunicamycin induced ER stress in the liver
in mouse [31–33]. Especially, Morin et al revealed that
the major pathological manifestations of tunicamycin
toxicity occurred first and foremost in the liver [28]. The
results of histological analysis in this study showed that the
treatment of 0.08 mg/kg tunicamycin resulted in lymphocyte
accumulation in lobular and portal of liver; however,
tunicamycin treatment at the dose of 0.005 and 0.02 mg/
kg did not cause any changes in liver tissues. Above results
indicated that 0.02 mg/kg tunicamycin was safe for treating
mice bearing tumor xenograft.
We then examined the effects of 0.02 mg/kg
tunicamycin on protein expressions such as GRP78,
CHOP and EGFR family. Treatment with 0.02 mg/kg
tunicamycin for 21 days resulted in significant decrease
of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 in tumor samples from
MCF-7/HER2 xenograft, demonstrating that the dose of
0.02 mg/kg tunicamycin abrogated the N-glycosylation

process in tumor. Tunicamycin treatment dramatically
elevated GRP78 protein; however, no alterations of
CHOP protein levels were found in tumor tissues between
treatment group and control group, indicating that
tunicamycin induced ER stress in tumor tissues and that
the ER stress was under the moderate levels since severe
ER stress will lead to cell death through enhanced CHOP
expression. By compared with control group, tunicamycin
treatment at the dose of 0.02 mg/kg did not produce any
changes of EGFR family and its downstream pathways,
as well as GRP78 and CHOP protein levels in liver
samples. This result indicated that the dose of 0.02 mg/kg
tunicamycin was not enough to reach the point to inhibit
N-glycosylation in liver tissue which proliferate slower
greatly then tumor tissue.
Previous report showed tunicamycin at tolerable
doses can reduce N-glycosylation in xenograft tumor and
the activity of inhibiting N-glycosylation can sustain for up
to 96 h after tunicamycin was intraperitoneally injected into
nude mice bearing glioma cancer cells D54. Furthermore,
D54 and U87MG glioma xenograft tumor experiments
showed significant reductions in tumor growth following
N-glycosylation inhibition and radiation therapy, consistent
with an enhancement in tumor radiosensitivity [17]. Another
study demonstrated that tunicamycin inhibits angiogenesis
in vivo and reduces a double and a triple negative breast
tumor growth in nude mice [21]. Due to disruption of EGFR
family and no toxicity with the tunicamycin treatment at
the dose 0.02 mg/kg, combined treatment of 0.02 mg/kg
tunicamycin with trastuzumab was used to evaluate the
antitumor growth effect in MCF-7/HER2 xenograft in
this study. The result showed that 0.02 mg/kg tunicamycin
was tolerable for nude mice and it enhanced the antitumor
activity of trastuzumab by enhancing apoptosis. Above
studies have provided evidence that low and tolerable dose
of tunicamycin can be used to inhibit tumor growth and to
sensitize tumor to trastuzumab treatment.
In this study, we confirmed that tunicamycin enhanced
the antitumor activity of trastuzumab against HER2overexpressing breast cancer through cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis by increasing p21 expression and decreasing the
EGFR family signaling pathways. We also proved that a
tolerable dose of tunicamycin inhibited N-glycosylation
and induced ER stress in tumor but not in liver tissues in
xenograft-bearing nude mice. Our results raised the possibility
that combinations of trastuzumab with tunicamycin or other
N-glycosylation inhibitors may be a promising approach for
improving the clinical activity of trastuzumab.

China). All cell lines were maintained in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C in different
media supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. An immortalized human
mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A was purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml
of epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/ml of hydrocortisone,
100 ng/ml of cholera toxin, 10 μg/ml of insulin, and
penicillin/streptomycin. Breast cancer cell lines included
MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MDAMB-453 and BT-474. MCF-7/HER2 was transfected
MCF-7 cells stably overexpressing HER2 protein. MCF-7
cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/HER2 plasmid and
grew in media supplemented with G418 for several weeks.
A single clone of stably transfected MCF-7/HER2 cell was
selected as measured by western blot. Normal human cell
lines included human embryonic kidney cells HEK-293T,
immortalized human mammary epithelial cells HMLE,
human umbilical vein endothelial cell HUVEC, and
human hepatocyte-derived cells HL7702. All the cell lines
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium or DMEM medium.

Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
Growth inhibition was determined using the SRB
assay which estimates cell number indirectly by measuring
total basic amino acids. Briefly, the cells were incubated in
96-well microtiter plates for 24 h. Following the addition
of test drugs, the plates were incubated at 37°C for an
additional 96 h in a 5% CO2 incubator. The culture medium
was then discarded and the cells were fixed in situ by the
gentle addition of 100 μl of cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic
acid and incubated for 60 min at 4°C. The supernatant was
discarded and the plates were washed five times with tap
water and air dried. SRB solution (100 μl) at 0.4% (w/v)
in 1% acetic acid was added and plates were incubated for
20 min at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye
was removed by washing five times with 1% acetic acid
and the plates were air dried. Bound stain was subsequently
solubilised with 10 mM Tris (pH 10.5) and the absorbance
was read at 515 nm on a Bio-Rad 550 ELISA microplate
reader. Trastuzumab was obtained from Genentech/Roche,
USA. Tunicamyicn was pursed from Sigma, USA.

Drug interaction analysis
Drug interaction was determined by the isobologram
and combination-index methods, derived from the median
effect principle of Chou and Talalay using the CalcuSyn
software [34]. Using data from the growth inhibitory
experiments and computerized software, a combination
index (CI) value is generated over a range of Fa levels
from 0.05–0.95 (5%-95% growth inhibition). CI < 1,
CI = 1, and CI > 1 indicate synergism, additive and
antagonism, respectively.

Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry

Inhibition of tumor growth in vivo

The cells were trypsinized, washed in ice-cold 70%
ethanol, and then stored at −20°C. Prior to analysis, the
samples were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and resuspended in a solution of propidium iodide
(50 mg/ml) and RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS for 30 min
in the dark. Data collected from each 10,000-cell sample
was analyzed by Flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson Co.,
USA).

Annexin V-FITC/Propidium iodide (PI) binding
assay was employed to determine the viable, early
apoptotic cells. Following the recommended protocols
of the Annexin V-FITC kit (BD Pharmingen, USA), the
cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells/ml per well in 6-well
plates. After treatment with tunicamycin, trastuzumab
alone, or both, the cells were harvested and washed twice
with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of binding
buffer. A total of 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 10 μl of PI
were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min
in the dark. Finally, 400 μl of binding buffer was added
to the cells, and the mixture was analyzed with a flow
cytometer.

The research protocol was inaccordance with
the institutional guidelines of the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Shandong University. The animals were
housed under pathogen-free conditions. Female BALB/c
(nu/nu) mice (20 ± 2 g, 4–6 weeks old) were purchased
from the Animal Center of the China Academy of Medical
Sciences (Beijing, China). The breast cancer SKBR3
or MCF-7/HER2 cells, 5.0 × 106, suspended in 100 μl
PBS, were subcutaneously inoculated into the lower
right flank of the nude mice. Nude mice bearing MCF-7/
HER2 xenograft were also implanted with 17β-estradiol
tablets. When the tumors were 100–150 mm3, the mice
were divided randomly into different groups (n = 6 in
each group). The control group received PBS only. The
mice receiving individual treatment of tunicamycin or
the combined treatment of tunicamycin with 10 mg/kg
trastuzumab were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μl
drugs twice a week. The mice were treated for 3 weeks.
The diameter of the tumor was measured twice a week
with a caliper. Tumor volume was calculated with the
following formula: v = ab2/2, where a and b are the long
diameter and the perpendicular short diameter of the
tumor, respectively. The body weights were measured
once a week.

Western blot analysis

Histological examination of liver tissues

The cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS,
and then lysed with buffer containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM
EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1%
SDS, protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 5 mg/ml
aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin and 5 mg/ml pepstatin),
and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mM β-glycerophosphate,
50 mM NaF, and 1 mM Na3VO4). The tumor and liver
tissue were washed with PBS and then were ground with
the same lysis buffer. The lysates were incubated at 4°C
for 20 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Equal
amounts of lysate (20 μg or 30 μg) were resolved by
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Millipore, USA). The membranes were
blocked in 5% non-fat skim milk/TBST [20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20] at room
temperature for 2 h and detected with primary antibodies
at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were then
blotted for 1 h at room temperature with an appropriate
horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody,
followed by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot
detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, USA).
The primary antibody cyclin D1, p21, cleaved PARP-1,
GRP78 (N-20), actin, and the secondary antibody were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA); all
the other primary antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology.

Liver tissues obtained from nude mice were fixed
with 10% formalin and then embedded in paraffin. Then
5  μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylineosin (HE) staining.

Annexin V-FITC/Propidium iodide assay

TUNEL staining
The apoptosis of paraffin-embedded tumor sections
was detected using a TUNEL assay kit according to the
manufacturer’s manual (Roche). In brief, fixed and paraffinembedded sections were dewaxed then permeabilized with
proteinase K for 15 min at room temperature. Sections were
treated with 3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidases
and then incubated with equilibration buffer and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme. Finally,
sections were incubated with antidigoxigenin-peroxidase
conjugate. Tissue peroxidase activity was evaluated
through DAB application. Sections were examined under
a light microscope.

Statistical analysis
All quantitative data were subject to ANOVA to
determine if there were significant differences between
groups. For data groups satisfying the ANOVA criteria
(P < 0.05), individual comparisons were conducted
using the Student’s t-test; P < 0.05 was considered
significant.
