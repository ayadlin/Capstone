ABSTRACT
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO) is an immunosuppressive molecule
expressed by most human tumors. IDO levels correlate with poor prognosis in
cancer patients and IDO inhibitors are under investigation to enhance endogenous
anticancer immunosurveillance. Little is known of immune-independent functions of
IDO relevant to cancer therapy. We show, for the first time, that IDO mediates human
tumor cell resistance to a PARP inhibitor (olaparib), gamma radiation, cisplatin, and
combined treatment with olaparib and radiation, in the absence of immune cells.
Antisense-mediated reduction of IDO, alone and (in a synthetic lethal approach) in
combination with antisense to the DNA repair protein BRCA2 sensitizes human lung
cancer cells to olaparib and cisplatin. Antisense reduction of IDO decreased NAD+ in
human tumor cells. NAD+ is essential for PARP activity and these data suggest that
IDO mediates treatment resistance independent of immunity and at least partially
due to a previously unrecognized role for IDO in DNA repair. Furthermore, IDO levels
correlated with accumulation of tumor cells in G1 and depletion of cells in G2/M of
the cell cycle, suggesting that IDO effects on cell cycle may also modulate sensitivity
to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. IDO is a potentially valuable therapeutic
target in cancer treatment, independent of immune function and in combination with
other therapies.

INTRODUCTION

clinical resistance to treatment [4]. The immunoregulatory
molecule indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is essential
for oxidative catabolism of tryptophan in the kynurenine
pathway [5]. Depletion of tryptophan and production of
kynurenine compounds suppresses T cell activation and
proliferation [5]. IDO in human tumors can facilitate
immune evasion and tumor metastasis and lead to poor
patient outcome [6-8]. In addition, other cells that reside
in the tumor microenvironment, including dendritic cells
and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), often
express IDO and help to create tumor tolerance to tumor-

Chemo- and radiation-resistance are major obstacles
to treatment of most human tumors, regardless of their
tissue of origin [1]. Identifying molecules underlying
treatment resistance and targeting them therapeutically
may sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. Multiple mechanisms confer drug resistance
on cancer cells, including alterations in drug metabolism,
modifications to drug targets, dysregulation of apoptotic
proteins, and enhanced DNA repair [2, 3] that can lead to

infiltrating cytotoxic T cells [9, 10]. Notably, IDO induces
Treg cells to further suppress tumor-reactive T cells [11].
IDO appears to have additional, non-enzymatic
functions, including a role in TGF beta-induced tolerance
in plasmacytoid dendritic cells [12]. Moreover, the
therapeutic activity of the BCR-Abl inhibitor imatinib
has been attributed to IDO suppression and its consequent
effect on Treg cell function [13]. In contrast, it has been
speculated that IDO can directly affect tumor cells,
independent of effects on Treg cells and other cells of the
immune system. Such effects include blocking mTOR
activity, inducing autophagy, and increasing NAD+ levels
[14, 15]. Regardless of that, the relationship between IDO
and non-immune related resistance to cytotoxic drugs or
radiation in human tumors has not been studied.
Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) proteins
are involved in cellular responses to DNA damage,
including DNA repair and damage-induced cell death [16].
Therefore, limiting DNA repair by treating cancer cells
with PARP inhibitors results in increased DNA damage.
Hence these agents are being investigated as cancer
treatment strategies [16]. Olaparib (AZD2281) is among
the best-studied PARP inhibitors in both pre-clinical
studies and human clinical trials [17, 18]. BRCA1/2
mutations in ovarian tumor cells may induce sensitivity
to olaparib and reversion of BRCA gene mutations can
reduce that sensitivity [19], but mechanisms underlying
development of olaparib resistance to a greater degree than
that mediated by functional BRCA is poorly understood.
Furthermore, phase III trials of olaparib in ovarian
cancer were terminated due to lack of increased overall
survival in spite of evidence of olaparib-induced increase
in progression-free survival [20]. Because most human
tumors express IDO in vivo [21, 22] we investigated
whether IDO in human tumor cells affected their response
to olaparib treatment in the absence of immune cells.
Radiation is a common component of lung cancer
treatment strategies, often combined with surgery,
chemotherapy, or both. Inhibition of PARP1 enhances
sensitivity to radiation in various tumor types including
those of lung, ovary, and prostate; PARP inhibition in
conjunction with radiation treatment could be effective in
these cancers [20, 23, 24]. We investigated the capacity
of tumor cell IDO to inhibit the combined therapeutic
effects of olaparib and radiation. We report that increased
IDO in human lung and cervical adenocarcinoma tumor
cells conferred resistance to combined treatment with
these agents, and antisense-mediated reduction in IDO
sensitized cells to these treatments.
Radiation-induced DNA breaks in mammalian cells
are normally accompanied by depletion of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a consequence that can
affect the capacity of cancer cells to repair those breaks
[25]. However, the effect of IDO-mediated NAD+
production on cancer cell sensitivity to radiation is not
known. We show, for the first time, that IDO expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in cancer cells, independent of the immune system,
conferred resistance to both olaparib and gamma radiation,
alone and in combination with each other. Both gamma
radiation and cisplatin can induce DNA double strand
breaks (DDSBs) in cancer cells. Therefore, we examined
the role of IDO in sensitivity to cisplatin. Inhibiting DNA
repair by targeting BRCA2 is an attractive approach to
sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy [26]. We therefore
combined IDO and BRCA2 downregulation is the context
of cisplatin treatment. We report that antisense-mediated
reduction of IDO in cancer cells sensitized those cells to
cisplatin, alone and in combination with BRCA2 siRNA
downregulation.

RESULTS
Generation of A549, HeLa and H441 clonal
populations with high and low IDO expression
We stably transfected human adenocarcinoma A549,
HeLa, and H441 cells with plasmids directing production
of anti-IDO shRNA or control non-targeting shRNA.
Although most human tumors express IDO in vivo [27],
IDO protein is undetectable in A549 and HeLa cells until
induced by IFN gamma in vitro. Therefore, we used IFN
gamma to induce IDO in both A549 and HeLa cells in
these studies. However, H441 cells express IDO mRNA
and protein without IFN gamma treatment in vitro (data
not shown). Multiple A549, HeLa, and H441 clonal
populations, with and without anti-IDO shRNA and with
different basal levels of IDO mRNA and protein, were
obtained (Figure 1, A-C, and Supplementary Figure 1).
Upon IFN gamma stimulation, IDO-expressing clones
(i.e., those expressing control non-targeting shRNA)
proliferated more slowly than IDO-downregulated clones
(i.e, those expressing anti-IDO shRNA)(Figure 1, D-E).
Because IDO expression is correlated with decreased
proliferation [27] and the presence of anti-IDO shRNA
attenuated IFN gamma-induced reduction in proliferation,
these data suggest that IFN gamma-induced IDO protein is
functional in these cells and that anti-IDO shRNA reduces
IDO function.

IDO in tumor cells affects cell cycle
IDO slows proliferation in tumor cells [28] and IDOmediated depletion of tryptophan induces cell cycle arrest
in T cells at G1 [29]. We therefore determined whether
IDO-induced reduction in growth of cancer cells was
associated with altered cell cycle. IFN gamma induction
of IDO increased the number of cells in G1 and decreased
the numbers in G2/M in cells expressing scrambled control
shRNA. The presence of anti-IDO shRNA in cells treated
with IFN gamma abolished the increase and decrease,

(required by PARP) in human tumor cells after antisensemediated reduction in IDO. We therefore hypothesized
that IDO knockdown increases olaparib sensitivity. We
induced IDO in A549 and HeLa clonal cell lines, with
and without anti-IDO shRNA, by treatment with IFN
gamma and then treated the cells with olaparib for 72
h. IDO downregulation in A549 cells increased tumor
cell sensitivity to low dose (1 microM)(data not shown)
and high dose (5 microM) olaparib by 18% (P=1X10-3)
(Figure 3A and B and Supplementary Figure 2A). IDO
downregulation sensitized HeLa cells to olaparib, but
to a lesser degree than in A549 cells (Figure 3C and D
and Supplementary Figure 2A and B). A549 and HeLa
cells with unimpeded IDO expression after IFN gamma
induction had increased resistance to olaparib, the
effectiveness of the administered dose of the drug was
reduced significantly, while antisense-downregulation
of IDO during and after IFN gamma induction resulted
in sensitivity to olaparib equal to that of cells untreated
with IFN gamma (Figure 3E and F). These results show
that IDO expression in tumor cells confers resistance to

IDO downregulation decreases intracellular NAD+
Because NAD+ is necessary for PARP activity [15],
intracellular levels of NAD+ were compared in IDOexpressing and non-expressing cells. After IFN gamma
stimulation, two independently-derived A549 clones
expressing anti-IDO shRNA had lower amounts of NAD+
than two similarly-generated clones expressing scrambled
control shRNA (Figure 2B). These data indicate that
shRNA-mediated suppression of IFN gamma-induced
IDO decreases intracellular NAD+ levels and has the
potential to modulate PARP function.

IDO in tumor cells mediates resistance to olaparib
Several PARP inhibitors are undergoing clinical
testing, alone and in combination with other treatments
[20, 30]. We observed decreased levels of NAD+

olaparib and, since all clonal populations were treated
with IFN gamma identically, the observed resistance to
olaparib was due solely to the presence of shRNA (and, by
extension, IDO knockdown) and not effects of IFN gamma
unrelated to IDO.

siRNA and then treated with olaparib. Concurrent
downregulation of IDO and BRCA2 sensitized tumor
cells to olaparib (1 microM) to a greater degree than after
knockdown of either target alone (Figure 4), possibly by
reducing the capacity of these cells to repair DNA lesions
result of their genomic instability.

Concurrent downregulation of IDO and BRCA2

IDO mediates resistance to gamma radiation in
cancer cells

BRCA2 is important in homologous recombination
repair (HRR). Tumor cells lacking BRCA1 and BRCA2
are sensitive to PARP inhibitors [31-33]. In view of
the involvement of IDO in PARP-mediated DNA
repair in cancer cells we hypothesized that concurrent
downregulation of IDO and BRCA2 in cells would reduce
PARP-mediated DNA repair and HRR, respectively,
and sensitize cancer cells to olaparib more effectively
than knockdown of either target alone. We transiently
transfected A549 clonal populations (with and without
stably-incorporated anti-IDO shRNA) with BRCA2

Radiation remains an important treatment modality
for many solid tumors. Cancer cell capacity to repair DNA
damage plays an important role in conferring resistance
to radiation therapy, which exerts its effects by inducing
DNA damage [34]. In view of the potential for IDO to
modulate PARP activity, we hypothesized that human
tumor cell IDO mediates resistance to gamma radiation.
We induced IDO expression in A549 and HeLa clonal
cell lines (with and without anti-IDO shRNA) with IFN
gamma and treated with gamma radiation 48 h later. IDO

downregulation sensitized cancer cells to radiation by
approximately 20% (P=2.6x10-7)(Fig. 5A-D). Reduction
in colony-forming capacity induced by gamma radiation
was similarly enhanced by antisense reduction of IDO
(data not shown). A549 and HeLa clones untreated with
IFN gamma (i.e., lacking IDO) were equally sensitive to
radiation regardless of whether or not they harbored antiIDO shRNA (Figure 5, A and C; Supplementary Figure
3). In addition, IDO induced by IFN gamma treatment
of A549 clones lacking anti-IDO shRNA (i.e., stably
expressing only control scrambled shRNA) increased
resistance to gamma radiation by approximately 15%,
compared with no change in clones harboring anti-IDO
shRNA (Figure 5E). HeLa cells showed a similar trend
toward increased resistance after IFN gamma treatment,
but not to a degree that achieved statistical significance
(Figure 5F). These data reveal a previously unidentified
role for IDO in mediating resistance to cancer therapy,
independent of immune function but highly relevant to
cancer treatment.

and subsequently inhibiting DNA repair through the use
of gamma radiation and PARP inhibitors, respectively,
it was of interest to determine the effect of IDO on cell
sensitivity to the combination of these treatments. We
tested this hypothesis by inducing IDO in A549 and
HeLa clones with IFN gamma and treating 48 h later with
gamma radiation (4 Gy). Immediately after irradiation,
cells were exposed to medium containing olaparib (5
microM) and assessed for proliferative capacity. Prior to
treatment with IFN gamma, all clonal A549 and HeLa
populations (harboring either anti-IDO shRNA or control
scrambled shRNA) were equally sensitive to combined
treatment (Figure 6A and C; Supplementary figure 4).
After IDO induction with IFN gamma, A549 and HeLa
clones harboring anti-IDO shRNA were approximately
56% and 20% more sensitive to combined treatment with
gamma radiation and olaparib, respectively, than similarlytreated clones harboring control scrambled shRNA
(p≤0.05)(Figure 6B and D; Supplementary Figure 4). In
addition, IFN gamma induced IDO-mediated resistance
to the antiproliferative effects of combined olaparib and
gamma radiation, but anti-IDO shRNA abolished that
resistance (Figure 6E and F). These data suggest that IDO
counteracts combined treatment with gamma radiation and
olaparib, and that antisense-mediated reduction of IDO in
conjunction with combined treatments to induce DNA

beneficial independent of the role of IDO in immunity.

siRNA to inhibit DNA repair, treated with IFN gamma
to induce IDO, and then exposed to cisplatin for 72
h to assess the effect on proliferation. Simultaneous
knockdown of both IDO and BRCA2 sensitized A549
cells to cisplatin to a greater degree (70%) than either
IDO knockdown alone (47%) or BRCA2 knockdown
alone (20%)(Figure 8A-B). These data further suggest that
blocking IDO in cancer cells in combination with cisplatin
(and, potentially, other DNA-damaging cytotoxics), alone
or in combination with drugs that target DNA repair
(including potential antisense drugs) improve the efficacy
of chemotherapy.

IDO knockdown, alone or in combination with
BRCA2 knockdown, sensitizes cancer cells to
cisplatin
Since IDO downregulation sensitized cancer cells to
gamma radiation, we determined whether IDO knockdown
sensitizes A549, HeLa, and H441 cells to the DNA crosslinking agent cisplatin. We induced IDO in A549 and
HeLa cells by treatment with IFN gamma but not H441
cells (natural IDO expressers) and then exposed cells to
cisplatin to determine the effect on proliferation. IDO
downregulation sensitized both A549 and HeLa cells to
cisplatin treatment by 18% compared to cells without
IDO reduction (p≤0.05)(Figure 7A-D). H441 cells stably
transfected with anti-IDO shRNA were more sensitive to
cisplatin than IDO-expressing H441 cells transfected with
scrambled control shRNA (Supplementary Figure 5).
In addition, A549 clonal populations (with and
without anti-IDO shRNA) were transfected with BRCA2

DISCUSSION
IDO is expressed by most solid tumors (27),
mediates tryptophan degradation, and plays a role in
inhibiting immune cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells.
Blocking the enzymatic function of IDO has been shown
to sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapeutic anticancer
drugs, but only in the context of an active immune system
[35]. The data shown here reveal a new function for IDO,
exclusive of immune activity, in mediating human tumor

cell resistance to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, gamma
radiation, and cisplatin. PARP proteins are essential for
repair of single-strand DNA breaks (SSB), mainly through
base excision repair (BER) but also in homologous
recombination repair (HRR) and non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ)[16]. Unrepaired SSBs can generate double
strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication that can be
fatal to cells. PARP inhibition is preferentially cytotoxic
to cancer cells with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations
[36], but that effectiveness is reduced in cells with
intact BRCA function. The reduction in effectiveness is
evident in the failure of olaparib to increase the overall
survival of ovarian patients [19], suggesting that PARP
inhibition alone requires improvement to confer sufficient
therapeutic benefit. We found that IDO induced by
IFN gamma decreased the effectiveness of olaparib in
BRCA-normal lung adenocarcinoma A549 and cervical
adenocarcinoma HeLa cells (Fig. 3E-F). Furthermore,
antisense-mediated reduction in the amount of IDO
induced by IFN gamma reduced cellular NAD+ in A549
human tumor cell line by approximately 60% (Fig. 2D),
similar to the reduction observed in vitro after treatment
with FK866 (a pharmacological inhibitor of NAD+)
[37]. IDO catalyzes the rate-limiting step in tryptophan
catabolism in the kynurenine pathway, which is a source
of NAD+ in cells. Depletion of NAD+ by FK866 sensitizes
cancer cells to apoptosis [38], and FK866 has been tested
in a phase II clinical trial for treatment of chronic B-cell
lymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
[15]. IDO-mediated increase in NAD+ has the potential
to counter the therapeutic effect of agents such as FK866
(unpublished data), particularly in combination with
cytotoxic agents that induce genotoxic events (gamma
radiation and cisplatin, for example). Increased NAD+
concomitant with IDO induction in human tumor cells
may enhances PARP activity and resistance to PARP
inhibitors (among multiple NAD+ roles [39] including
NAD+-mediated resistance to reactive oxygen stress [40]).
The capacity of IDO inhibition to concomitantly reduce
the amount of NAD+ and enhance the effectiveness of
PARP inhibitors suggests a causative link. Moreover, IDO
inhibition by treatment with antisense or small molecule
drugs including 1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT)[14], alone or
in combination with FK866, could increase the therapeutic
impact of NAD+ inhibition in tumor cells. We showed, for
the first time, that IDO in cancer cells can diminish the
therapeutic effect of a PARP inhibitor and that blocking
IDO can increase the effectiveness of PARP inhibition.
We have recently reported that concurrent targeting
of BRCA2 and thymidylate synthase in A549 and Hela
cells with antisense molecules sensitizes these human
tumor cells to cisplatin and melphalan in a fashion
consistent with complementary lethality [26]. Combined
antisense-mediated knockdown of IDO (with stablyincorporated shRNA) and BRCA2 (with transientlytransfected siRNA) increased sensitivity to either olaparib
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or cisplatin in an additive fashion (Figs. 4 and 8). These
observations provide, for the first time, a rational basis
for targeting IDO in the context of treatments that inhibit
DNA repair and/or induce DNA damage in human tumor
cells. Tumors harboring BRCA2 mutations are more
responsive to treatment with alkylating agents such as
cisplatin [41]. Most solid tumors, including ovarian and
breast tumors, express IDO [27], suggesting that IDO
inhibition (using either 1-MT or therapeutic antisense
agents) in combination with DNA-damaging and/or DNA
repair-inhibiting drugs will be of value.
Gamma radiation is commonly used to treat
lung tumors, often in combination with chemotherapy
[42]. However, cancer cell PARP activity is of utmost
importance in supporting survival in response to radiationinduced DNA damage [34]. PARP1 inhibition enhances
the sensitivity of lung tumor cells to radiation [43], and
combined radiation and PARP inhibition is therefore an
attractive treatment possibility. Yet most solid tumors
express IDO, especially at the relatively advanced stages
when therapeutic gamma radiation is used. The capacity
of IDO to mediate resistance to gamma radiation (Fig.
5) could undermine the effectiveness of radiation alone
or combined with PARP inhibition. Specific reduction of
IDO increased the effectiveness of combined treatment
with radiation and olaparib in an additive fashion (Fig.
6), suggesting that therapeutic IDO knockdown will be of
value in enhancing combined treatments.
We have previously shown that IDO expressed
by mouse tumors reduces the capacity of endogenous
immune cells to recognize and kill tumor cells [8, 44].
IDO blockade in combination with passive or active
immunotherapy has been proposed as a strategy to
enhance immunotherapy effectiveness [45]. Furthermore,
combining an IDO inhibitor (to enhance endogenous antitumor immune activity) with chemotherapy (to directly
target tumors) has been demonstrated to be effective
both in vitro and in vivo and dependent on a functioning
immune system [35]. Our data similarly support the
concept of blocking IDO in combination with gamma
radiation or olaparib (alone and in together, and potentially
with additional targeting of BRCA2 in an induced lethality
strategy) or cisplatin, with the critical new information that
IDO can potentiate the action of these treatment modalities
independent of immune function and regardless of the
capacity of endogenous immune cells to recognize and kill
tumor cells. Moreover, most effector immune cells secrete
IFN gamma as part of their anti-tumor cytotoxic function
[6]. As we show in this study, IFN gamma-induced IDO in
cancer cells can mediate tumor cell resistance to anticancer
cytotoxic drugs and gamma radiation. Therefore, reducing
IDO production and/or function using small molecule
drugs or antisense molecules may be particularly valuable
in to enhance combined treatment with cytotoxic drugs
and active and passive immunotherapy approaches that
depend on endogenous immune cell function.

IDO induction decreased tumor cell proliferation,
increasing accumulation of cells in G1 and decreasing
accumulation in G2/M. Antisense knockdown of IDO
reduced accumulation of cells in G1 and partially restored
proliferation (Fig. 2A). Increased time in G1 is important
to increase the ability of tumor cells to undergo complete,
error-free DNA repair capable of removing basal and
therapy-induced DNA damage (30). The increase in the
number of cells in G1 seen exclusively in IDO-expressing
cell lines suggests a possible broader role for this protein
in cell-cycle checkpoint control, allowing for repair of
DNA damage during G1 phase of the cell cycle (18, 30).
However, increased tumor cell proliferation in response
to IDO targeting has the potential to be counterproductive
due to the resulting increase in tumor growth [27].
However, IDO knockdown-mediated sensitization to
olaparib, radiation, or BRCA2 knockdown (alone and
in combination), and cisplatin, all abolished the proproliferative effect of IDO targeting and increased the
anti-proliferative effect of those therapies. Regardless
of IDO-mediated reduction in growth rate, tumor cells
could benefit from IDO-mediated G1 arrest in the
context of cytotoxic therapy; slowed cell cycle transit
time can increase the amount and fidelity of DNA repair
contributing to treatment resistance [46]. Tumor cells
commonly have reduced G1 checkpoint function and
depend preferentially on S and G2 checkpoints to avoid
DNA damage-induced death [18]. IDO targeting as a
strategy to enhance currently approved and novel induced
lethality approaches can be valuable regardless of potential
limitations associated with targeting IDO in the absence of
concurrent therapies.
In summary, we show for the first time that IDO
mediates immune-independent, tumor cell-autonomous
resistance to the PARP inhibitor olaparib and gamma
radiation (as single treatments and in combination) and
cisplatin. Antisense knockdown of IDO increased human
tumor cell sensitivity to olaparib, gamma radiation, and
cisplatin. Therapeutic targeting of IDO appears to be
of value, not only in increasing endogenous antitumor
immunity, but also in enhancing tumor sensitivity to
therapy independent of immunity.

fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and
100 µg streptomycin (pen/strep), hereafter referred to as
growth medium.

IDO downregulation
Human A549, HeLa, and H441 cells were stably
transfected with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) antisense
to human IDO1 (SuperArray, Mississauga, ON; using
Lipofectamine 2000 (LFA2K) (Invitrogen, Burlington,
ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(see Supplementary Material, Supplementary Figure 1,
and Supplementary Table 1).

IDO mRNA quantitation
Stably-transfected A549 and H441 clonally-selected
populations were collected 24 h after treatment with or
without interferon gamma (IFN gamma)(25 ng/ml, R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Cells were
lysed (Trizol reagent, Invitrogen) and total RNA isolated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA
was synthesized by reverse transcription (MMLV-RT,
Invitrogen) using 1 µg of purified RNA. IDO and 18s
rRNA levels were measured simultaneously by multiplex
real-time PCR amplification using a TaqMan IDO1 gene
expression assay kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).

IDO protein detection and measurement
Cell extracts were prepared from A549 and HeLa
cells cultured in 75 cm2 flasks and treated with IFN gamma
(25 ng/ml). Cells were incubated for 48 h, washed twice
with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and sonicated. Lysed cells
were centrifuged at 15000 x RPM for 15 min at 4°C and
the supernatant collected and stored at -80°C for future
use. Protein extracts (20 microg) were quantified by
BioRad protein assay, separated by electrophoresis through
a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and then electro-transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane. Monoclonal antibodies
against IDO (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and actin (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) were used to detect and quantify these
proteins on the membrane and were visualized using a
Storm scanner (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

NAD+ quantification

Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, cervical
adenocarcinoma HeLa, and lung papillary adenocarcinoma
H441 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), and maintained in minimal essential
medium alpha (MEM alpha), Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) or RPMI-1640, respectively,
supplemented with 10% (A549 and HeLa) or 20% (H441)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NAD+ levels were measured in A549 clonal
populations stably transfected with plasmids directing
expression of anti-IDO shRNA or scrambled shRNA,
using a NAD+/NADH quantification Kit (BioVision,
Milpitas, CA; Catalog#K337-100). Briefly, 2 x 105 cells
were seeded into 25 cm2 flasks and grown overnight.
Medium was replaced 16-24 h later with 3 ml of fresh
2787

Oncotarget

gamma radiation treatment

growth medium containing IFN gamma (25 ng/ml). Cells
were washed 48 h later with ice-cold PBS, pelleted by
centrifugation, and extracted using 2 freeze/thaw cycles
and NADH/NAD extraction buffer (400 microl). NADt
(total NAD including NADH and NAD) was detected in
50 µl of extracted samples after addition of NAD cycling
buffer and NAD cycling enzyme mix to a total volume of
100 µl. NADH levels were measured in a similar fashion
in aliquots where NAD+ was degraded beforehand by
heating the samples to 60 °C for 30 minutes. NAD+ levels
were calculated by subtracting NADH levels from NADt
levels. Samples were read at OD450 nm using a Wallac
Victor2 plate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Waltham,
MA).

A549 and HeLa cells (5x104) were seeded into 25
cm2 flasks in 2 ml of growth medium. Culture media
was replaced with medium with or without IFN gamma
(25 ng/ml) 16-24 h later. Cells were exposed to gamma
radiation (4 Gy) using a 60Co irradiator (London, Ontario,
Canada) or a Varian Clinical 21EX Linear accelerator
(Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA) using a 6 MV
X ray beam (40 x 40 cm with 1.5 cm water equivalent
buildup material) 48 h after addition of IFN gamma.
After irradiation, medium was replaced with fresh growth
medium without IFN gamma, and cells were allowed to
proliferate for 72 h. Cells were then trypsinized and live
cells were enumerated using a Coulter counter.

Cell cycle analysis

Combined treatment with radiation and olaparib

A549 cells (2x105) were cultured overnight and then
treated with or without IFN gamma (25 ng/ml). Forty-eight
h after IFN gamma addition, cells were washed with PBS,
trypsinized and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. Cells were
washed with PBS 24 h after fixation and resuspended in
1 ml of propidium iodide (20 microg/ml)(Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (BDH Chemicals,
Poole, UK) staining solution with RNAse A (Bioshop,
Burlington, ON,Canada) for 15 minutes at 37oC. Cells
were analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

A549 and HeLa cells (5x104) were grown and
irradiated as described above. Immediately after
irradiation, medium was replaced with fresh medium
containing olaparib (5 microM) and cells were allowed to
proliferate in culture for 72 h. Cells were then trypsinized
and live cells were enumerated using a Coulter counter.

siRNA transfection
SiRNA transfection was performed as described
previously [26]. Briefly, concentrations of siRNAs
targeting human BRCA2 [OnTarget Plus SMARTPool
BRCA2 (Dharmacon RNAi Technologies)] that reduced
target mRNAs by approximately 70% by 24 h after
transfection were determined (10 nM). BRCA2 siRNA
(10 nM) and control non-targeting siRNA (2.5 nM) in
serum-free MEM alpha and LFA2K (2.5 µg/ml) were
incubated together for 20 min. The siRNA:LFA2K mix
was then added to A549 cells that had been seeded, in
triplicate, at 2×105 cells per 25-cm2 flask 24 h beforehand.
At 4 h after addition of siRNA:LFA2K, media was
exchanged for fresh growth medium containing IFN
gamma (25 ng/ml). Medium was replaced with fresh
medium containing olaparib 16-24 h later. Tumor cell
proliferation was enumerated 72 h later using a Coulter
counter.

Olaparib and cisplatin treatment
A549 and HeLa cells (5x104) were seeded into
25 cm2 flasks in 2 ml of growth medium, Medium was
replaced with fresh growth medium with or without
IFN gamma (25 ng/ml) 16-24 h after seeding. Twentyfour or 48 h after addition of IFN gamma, medium was
replaced with fresh medium containing olaparib (1, 1.5
or 5 microM)(AZD2281, Selleckchem, Houston, TX) or
cisplatin (2.3, 4, or 8 microM)(Sigma-Aldrich). Three days
after addition of olaparib or cisplatin, cells were washed
to remove the dead cells and particles and adherent cells
were trypsinized and enumerated using a Coulter counter
(Beckman, Mississauga, ON). Viability of the counted
cells was confirmed by Trypan blue exclusion. H441
cells (5x104) were seeded into 6-well plates in 3 ml of
growth medium. Medium was replaced with fresh growth
medium containing cisplatin (5 or 10 microM) 16-24 h
after seeding. Seven days after addition of cisplatin, cells
were washed to remove the dead cells and particles and
adherent cells were trypsinized and enumerated by Coulter
counting.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test (2-tailed) was used to determine
differences between two means. One-way ANOVA was
used to assess differences among multiple means. A P
value of 0.05 was selected a priori to indicate a significant
difference.
	 In some analyses, data were pooled from A549
clonal populations that expressed anti-IDO shRNA and
