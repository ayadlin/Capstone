ABSTRACT
Despite the wide use of 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, development
of severe toxicity that follow the treatment is not a rare event. The efforts to
establish pretreatment tools for toxicity prediction, led to the development of
various pharmacogenetic and biochemical assays, mainly targeted to assess the
activity level of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the main metabolizing
enzyme for 5-fluorouracil. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we developed
a biochemical assay, that is not limited to the evaluation of DPD activity, but
determines the net result of all the enzymatic transformation of 5FU, in terms of
the amount of drug consumed by the cells in a time unit. This parameter, named
5-fluorauracil degradation rate, presents a normal distribution inside the population
and highlight the presence of an ultra-rapid metabolizers class of subjects, besides
the expected poor metabolizers class. Here we will show that, in a colorectal cancer
patient cohort, both poor and ultra-rapid metabolizers have significantly increased
the risk of developing severe toxicity (grade3–4). Patient stratification depending
on the individual 5-fluorouracil degradation rate allows to identify a 10% of the
overall population at high risk of developing severe toxicity, compared to the 1.3%
(as assessed in the Italian population) identified by the most commonly employed
pharmacogenetic test, including the DPD polymorphism IVS14+1G>A.

INTRODUCTION

France or Italy [7]. Moreover, a higher number of patients
suffer from unduly toxic effects, with avoidable suffering
and reducible costs for the Health Systems.
Pre-emptive identification of patients who develop
5-FU severe toxicity is still an open issue in cancer
management, hence the available methods identify only a
small fraction of such patients.
The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase enzyme
(DPD, encoded by the DPYD gene) transforms about
80% of the administrated 5-FU in the inactive metabolite
5, 6-dihydro-5-fluorouracil. The remaining 20% of the
drug is catabolized by activating enzymes (Figure 1), with

Fluorouracil, in combination with oxaliplatin,
irinotecan, and biological agents, is the most common
first line chemotherapy to treat colorectal cancer (CRC),
both in the adjuvant and palliative setting, [1–3]. Despite
efficacy, severe toxicity represents a major cause of
reduced dosage, delayed drug administration and therapy
discontinuation. Grade 3–4 toxicity is reported in about
30% of patients, with a 0.5% of toxic deaths [4, 5]. This
figure means that every year the 5-FU toxicity determines
approximately 1,300 deaths in the USA [6] and 200 in

the production of metabolites accounting for inhibition of
thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and for RNA/DNA damage
[8]. An impaired activity of DPD leads to an increased
production of cytotoxic metabolites and has been clearly
associated with 5-FU induced severe toxicities [9–11].
The most used pharmacogenetic assay to predict
DPD activity evaluates the presence of the splice site
IVS14+1G>A polymorphism in the DPYD gene, which
leads to production of a truncated, inactive protein and is
associated with severe toxicity in about one half of carriers
[12]. However, the IVS14+1G>A polymorphism has low
frequency and it is not present in the majority of the
patients with high 5-FU toxicity. Recently, we described
a that DPYD haplotype is associated with a decreased
value of 5FUDR and it could be related to toxicity
development [13]. The functional effect of additional
DPYD polymorphisms has been evaluated, but for the
moment their prediction power results inadequate [14].
Association with toxicity of polymorphisms in the
5-FU target TYMS and in the methylenetetrahydrofolate
reductase (MTHFR) has been widely studied and these
variants are frequently tested in pharmacogenetic assays,
but there is not a general consensus about their clinical
impact [15–18].
Along with pharmacogenetics, biochemical assays
for pretreatment evaluation of 5-FU metabolism have been
developed, including DPD deficiency testing in cell lysates
from peripheral blood and the plasma measurement of
uracil (U) and dihydrouracil/uracil ratio (UH2/U) [19–22].
The last two methods are based on the estimation of
DPD activity by the level of its endogenous substrate U
and the resulting metabolite, UH2, in plasma. This test
is characterized by good sensibility of 82,4% but low
specificity of 78.4%.
We previously described a pretreatment ex-vivo
assay to determine the rate of peripheral blood

mononuclear cells (PBMC) metabolizing 5-FU [23]. This
parameter (individual 5-FU degradation rate, 5-FUDR)
differs by others pretreatment assays, as it is not limited to
the evaluation of DPD activity, but determines the net result
of all the enzymatic transformation of 5-FU (Figure 1),
in terms of the amount (nmol) of drug consumed by cells
in a time unit. We also showed that the 5-FUDR value
is consistently lower in patients who develop grade 3–4
toxicity [23].
The present study was aimed to evaluate the
performance of 5-FUDR as a pretreatment predictor of
grade 3–4 toxicity and to compare it with currently used
pharmacogenetic markers. The distribution of allelic
variants of the genes DPYD, TYMS and MTHFR and the
pretreatment 5-FUDR was analyzed in 1010 mixed cancer
patients, and the association with 5-FU toxicity was
analyzed on 433 CRC patients.

RESULTS
All analyzed polymorphisms were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium [24]. In the overall population of
1010 mixed cancer patients (51.29% females, 48.71%
males, median age 66 years, age range 27–87), the mean
pretreatment 5-FUDR value (± standard deviation, SD) was
1.54 ± 0.41 ng/ml/106 cells/min, the median 1.55 ng/ml/106
cells/min and the interquartile range 1.25–1.84 ng/ml/
106 cells/min (range 0.03–3.01 ng/ml/106 cells/min). The
departure from a normal distribution was not statistically
significant (p = 0.82) at all, and this result was consistent
with the visual inspection of the histogram and the Kernel
density curve (Figure 2). The 5-FUDR parameter is not
significantly affected by age, gender, cancer type, or
polymorphisms in the MTHFR and TYMS genes (Table 1).
Only a small difference between mean values, at the edge
of significance (p = 0.072), appeared for the MTHFR

A1298C genotype: the homozygous carriers of the mutant
C allele have a slight decrease in mean 5-FUDR compared
to AA and AC genotypes (p = 0.072). In contrast, and as
expected, the presence of the DPYD IVS14+1G>A splice
variant affects significantly (p < 0.001) the 5-FUDR, with
the heterozygous carriers showing a marked decrease
in the mean 5-FUDR value compared to non-carriers
(0.81 ± 0.29 ng/ml/106 cells/min vs 1.54 ± 0.41 ng/
ml/106 cells/min) (Table 1). The DPYD IVS14+1G>A
polymorphisms was detected only as heterozygous with a
frequency of 1.28%.
Due to variability in chemotherapeutic regimens
among different cancer types and to statistical
considerations, we proceeded to study the association of
5-FUDR and gene polymorphisms with toxicity in the most
numerous cancer group, that was a subset of 433 CRC
patients treated with fluorouracil based regimens. Counts
and frequencies of 5-FU toxicities by demographics,
specific chemotherapy regimens, genetics and pre-treatment
5-FUDR (categorized by centiles) in this subgroup are
reported in Table 2. We detect a total of 92 (21.2%) cases of
severe toxicity (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria, version 3 [25], CTC3, grade 3 and grade 4, G3-G4).
The DPYD IVS 14+1G>A splice variant was present as
heterozygous with a frequency of 1.39%, comparable to the
frequency in the overall population. Of the six heterozygous
carriers patients in the CRC cohort, three (50.0%)
developed severe toxicity, whereas 89 (20.8%) out of the
427 non-carriers developed severe toxicity. The difference
in number of severe toxicity events between mutated DPYD
and wild-type DPYD did not reach statistical significance
(p = 0.113). In contrast, severe toxicity was found to be
significantly associated with an age above the median
(p = 0.007) and with a 5-FUDR below the 5th centile
(called poor metabolism - PM) or above the 95th centile
(called ultra-rapid metabolism - UM) (p = 0.002). In
particular, the PM and UM are associated with a 3.47 and
3.34 increased OR, respectively, compared to the normal
metabolizers (NM; 5-FUDR: 0.85–2.2 ng/ml/106 cells/min).

Using the 5-FUDR value as a stratification factor
to identify patients at higher risk of 5-FU G3-G4 toxicity
(e.g. PM or UM subjects), 40 patients (9.24% of total
population) potentially at risk can be recognized, of
whom 17 (42.5%) really developed G3-4 toxicity. Using
the presence of the DPYD IVS 14+1G>A splice variant
as a risk predictive factor, we could detect only 6 patients
(1.39% of total population) carriers of the marker, of
whom 3 (50.0%) really developed G3-G4 toxicity.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
values (PPV and NPV) of the DPYD IVS 14+1G>A
polymorphisms and of the 5-FUDR metabolic classes
(PM, UM, and PM plus UM) are reported in Table 3.

DISCUSSION
In recent years, pharmacogenetics has been
regarded as the most promising tool for preemptive risk
stratification, but recent results from large studies spread
some doubts about the actual usefulness of this approach.
[26–28].
This is the reason why alternative roads should be
walked to overcome the limits of 5-FU pharmacogenetics.
5-FU represents an elective drug to attempt biochemical
approaches in predicting drug metabolism. In fact,
unlike many drugs, the main metabolizing enzymes are
expressed in peripheral blood cells, allowing to evaluate
the efficiency of the individual drug metabolism by
non-invasive procedures such as using a peripheral
blood sample. Pre-treatment determination of DPD
enzymatic activity in cell lysates from peripheral
lymphocytes and the plasma assessment of UH2/U
ratio are well established assays [7]. Previously, we
developed a related biochemical assay aimed to evaluate
the 5FU-metabolism preemptively, but with a significant
functional difference. Whereas the above mentioned
tests are targeted to determine the activity level of the
DPD enzyme, the 5-FUDR assesses the combinatorial
effects produced by all the 5-FU metabolizing enzymes,

both activating (i.e.: orotate phosphoribosyltransferase,
OPRT; thymidylate phosphorylase, TP) and inactivating
(i.e.: dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, DPD) (Figure 1).
Hence, the 5-FUDR parameter translates the effects of
known and unknown genetic determinants, affecting 5-FU
metabolizing enzymes, into a measurable phenotype. In
this study, we have evaluated the general characteristics
of the pretreatment 5-FUDR value on more than 1000
subjects, showing that it is a continuous parameter with
a normal distribution in the population. This observation
is consistent with the known existence of a fraction of
persons with a very low rate of 5-FU metabolism (PM),
but also highlights the existence of a class of subjects with
an extremely rapid 5-FU metabolism (UM).
The effect of the individual 5-FUDR on 5-FU
toxicity was analyzed in a subgroup of 433 CRC patients.
The total number of severe toxicities observed in this
group (n = 92, 21.2%), as well as the higher frequency in
older patients, are consistent with the data reported in the
literature [12, 13].
Strikingly, we have found that both the PM
subjects, defined by a 5-FUDR <= 5th centile, and the
UM subjects, defined by a 5-FUDR > 95th centile, are
at higher risk of developing G3-4 toxicity, with an OR
of 3.47 and 3.34, respectively, compared to the class of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

normal metabolizers (5th < 5-FUDR < =95th centiles).
While a higher percentage of toxicity in PM was expected,
the association of 5-FU UM with severe toxicity was
more surprising. Indeed, to our knowledge, no similar
relationship between toxicity and a fast drug metabolism
has been reported, probably due to the lack of analytical
tests able to identify this kind of ultra-metabolizers. The
potential clinical consequences of a 5-FU ultra-rapid
metabolism are intriguing and deserve further studies.
In fact, the mechanism underlying a faster rate of 5-FU
consumption (that is, a higher 5-FUDR value) may involve
an increased activity of DPD or an increased activity of the
enzymes producing the active drug metabolites (Figure 1).
This hypothesis is consistent with data showing that the
5-FU sensitivity is correlated with polymorphisms in the
OPRT gene as well as in cancer tissues with the level of
activity of the OPRT enzyme and with the OPRT/DPD
activity ratio [29–32]. Thus, it could be speculated that
the individual 5-FUDR may be related to progression
free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), due to
an increased fraction of cytotoxic metabolites in ultrametabolizers.
As reported in Table 3, in the analyzed CRC patients
cohort, the 5-FUDR test allows risk stratification with a
specificity and a NPV similar to that obtained using the

DPYD IVS 14+1G>A genotyping and with a PPV ranging
from slightly to moderately lower than the DPYD IVS
14+1G>A PPV (47.37% for 5-FUDR PM and 38.10% for
5-FUDR UM compared to 50% of genotyping). In contrast,
the sensitivity of the 5-FUDR test is much higher than the
DPYD genotyping (18.48% vs 3.26%).). Even though it
still is far from the ideal preemptive assay, this increase in
sensitivity means that we would have had the opportunity
to avoid14 more cases of severe (potentially lethal) toxicity
compared to the 3 cases correctly predicted by the DPYD
genotyping (Table 2). The advantage of the 5-FUDR test
consists in the higher prevalence of the markers used to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

identify patients with poor and ultrarapid metabolism, which
by definition consist of a 10% of the population (5-FUDR
< 5th centile and > 95th centile) compared to the 1.28%
frequency of the DPYD IVS 14+1G>A polymorphisms
(frequency in the 1010 Italian patients sample).
However, proposal for novel preemptive tests must
consider cost-effectiveness. In the case of 5-FUDR, the
cost of the assay per sample is quite low (estimated at
around $10), since it does not required commercial kit
but it is based on the chromatographic separation of the
analyte, which is also a method easily transferrable into
clinical laboratories. Considering that the cost derived
20616

Genotyping

by inpatient care of each G3-G4 toxicity is generally
calculated in hundreds of dollars [33], the 5-FUDR
assessment is supposed to be cost-effective. Further, the
test result is available within one working day, so the test
can easily be scheduled during the pre-treatment phase of
patient evaluation and therapy selection.
A limitation for this study is that the
pharmacogenetics assay for prediction of 5-FU toxicity
includes only the main DPYD splice site polymorphisms,
while additional functional polymorphisms have recently
been proposed as important markers.
The future direction in the field of preemptive
identification of severe toxicity during 5-FU treatment
should point to the combination of genetic and phenotypic
markers to improve the sensitivity for detection of patients
at risk. The individual 5-FUDR appears as a suitable
marker for this scope. Besides, the 5-FUDR test gives the
opportunity to evaluate the potential clinical implications
of the 5-FU ultra rapid metabolism and, in our opinion, it
deserve further investigation as a prognostic markers of
5-FU treatment.
Finally, the significant number of severe toxicity
currently undetectable by preemptive assays, highlights
the need for a deeper understanding of the fluorouracil
metabolism. Estimating the ratio between active and
inactive drug metabolites probably will be the key to
uncover multiple mechanisms mediating 5-FU efficacy
and toxicities.

Germinal polymorphisms were analyzed as follows:
genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using
the X-tractor Gene system (Corbett Life Science,
Australia). The splice-site polymorphism, IVS14+1G>A
in the DPYD gene, C677T and A1298C SNPs in MTHFR
gene were analyzed using the commercial kit for
fluoropyrimidine response (Diatech, Jesi, Italy) according
to manufacturer’s protocol; briefly, region covering the
SNP of interest was amplified by PCR using specific
primers, and then sequenced using the Pyrosequencer
PyroMark ID system (Biotage AB and Biosystems,
Uppsala, Sweden). The variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTR; 2R or 3R) in the TYMS enhancer region (TSER)
was determined by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
according to manufacturer’s protocol (fluoropyrimidine
response - Diatech, Jesi, Italy) and visualized onto 2.2%
agarose gel.

Determination of the individual 5-FU
degradation rate
The test was performed as previously reported [23],
using a HPLC-MS/MS instrument (high performance
liquid
chromatography-mass
spectrometry/mass
spectrometry) including an Agilent 1100 chromatographic
system coupled to an API 3200 triple quadrupole
(ABSCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA).
Briefly,
freshly prepared peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(2.5–3.5 × 106 cells) are incubate at 37°C, with shaking,
with a known amount of 5-FU. Cells aliquots are drawn
at time 0, 1 h and 2 h, lysed and centrifuged and the
concentration of 5-FU in the supernatants is quantified
by HPLC-MS/MS. The 5-FUDR is expressed as ng
5-FU/ml/106 cells/min.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Data collected from 1010 cancer patients
followed at the Sant’Andrea Hospital of Rome, Italy,
between April 2009 and April 2013, was analyzed in
this retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were: age >
18 years; histologically documented cancer; Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2 or less;
cancer therapy toxicity absent; written informed consent.
Exclusion criteria: relevant diseases within 6 months
(i.e.: myocardial infarction, lung fibrosis, etc); 5-FU based
chemotherapy in the past. Chemotherapy-related toxicity
in the first six cycles of treatment was recorded according
to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria,
version 3 (CTC3) [25].
To study associations between DNA polymorphisms,
5-FUDR and 5-FU-related toxicity, we have selected a
subset of 433 CRC patients out of 1010 whose therapy
was based essentially on fluorouracil, e.i.: mFOLFOX6,
mFOLFIRI, XELOX with or without bevacizumab or
cetuximab, and capecitabine.
The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by
the institutional (Sapienza University) ethical committee
(Rif. 3762_2015/23.07.2015, Prot. 2377/2015).

Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA,
version 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex).
Shapiro-Wilk test was used as formal test for
departure from a normal distribution, and histogram with
a normal curve and a kernel density curve overlaid was
also performed for visual inspection of 5-FUDR and age
data distribution.
To remove some variability in outcome -at all
covariate values-, while maintaining structure of the
relationship between outcome and independent variables,
the independent variables were categorized as follow.
Subjects were subdivided into two groups with respect
to median age. The 5-FUDR parameter was divided
into 6 groups according with the value of the 5th, 25th,
50th, 75th, and 95th centile (≤ 0.85; > 0.85 ≤ 1.25; > 1.25
≤ 1.55; > 1.55 ≤ 1.84; > 1.84≤2.2; > 2.2 ng/ml/106 cells/
min, respectively). For further analysis on the CRC
20617

Oncotarget

patients subset, the data between 0.86 and 2.2 ng/ml/106
cells/min (5th–95th centiles) were taken together to create
a reference group (NM, normal metabolisms). Dummy
code was applied to sex, female = 1 and male = 0 in
regression analysis.
Data about symptoms’ severity were dichotomized
as no/mild toxicities (CTC3 grade 0, 1 and 2) versus
severe toxicity (CTC3 G3-4).
Data, presented as proportions and differences
between groups, were tested with Chi-squared or Fisher
exact test. Univariate and multivariate odds ratios
(ORs), and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for potential variables associated with severe toxicities
were estimated using logistic regression models. We used
the following model-building process: first we assessed
bivariate associations between the dependent variable
and each of the potential covariates; covariates not
significantly associated (p > 0.10) with the outcome were
dropped from further consideration in modeling outcome.
The remaining candidate covariates were entered into
a multiple regression model and subjected to backward
selection until all remaining covariates had p-value < 0.05,
adjusted for the other remaining covariates. Gender, age,
and gene polymorphisms were treated as confounding
variables. Akaike’s information criteria and the likelihood
ratio test were used to define the multivariable model.
Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were
assessed using the online HWE test calculator at http://
www.oege.org/software/hwe-mr-calc.shtml [24].
