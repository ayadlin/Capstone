BACKGROUND: Practice guidelines recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for bladder cancer. However, the evidence in support of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) is less robust. Here we describe whether the evidence of efficacy for NACT/ACT was sufficient to
change clinical practice and whether the efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials was translated into effectiveness in the general population. METHODS: Electronic records of treatment were linked to the population-based Ontario Cancer Registry to identify all patients
with bladder cancer treated with cystectomy in Ontario 1994-2008. Utilization of NACT/ACT was compared across 1994-1998, 19992003, and 2004-2008. Logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with NACT/ACT. Cox model and propensity score
analyses were used to explore the association between ACT and survival. RESULTS: Two thousand forty-four patients underwent cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Use of NACT remained stable (mean, 4%), whereas utilization of ACT increased
over time (16%, 18%, 22%; P 5.001). Advanced stage (T3/T4; OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.38-2.46) and node-positive disease (OR, 8.10; 95% CI,
6.20-10.7) were associated with greater utilization of ACT. Five-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for all
patients was 29% (95% CI, 28%-31%) and 33% (95% CI, 31%-35%), respectively. Utilization of ACT was associated with improved OS
(HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62-0.81) and CSS (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64-0.84). Results were consistent in propensity score analyses. CONCLUSIONS: NACT remains substantially underutilized in routine clinical practice. Our results suggest that perioperative chemotherapy is
associated with a substantial survival benefit in the general population. Patients who are planning to undergo cystectomy for bladder

INTRODUCTION
Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) may be locally controlled by cystectomy or radiotherapy (RT), but approximately
50% of patients ultimately die of distant metastases.
Randomized controlled trials and subsequent meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of neoadjuvant
(NACT)1-3 and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT)4,5 for bladder cancer. However, the evidence in support of ACT is less robust than that for NACT, and therefore its use is more controversial.6 Despite this controversy, the level of evidence showing efficacy has proved sufficient to prevent accrual to 3 contemporary RCTs of ACT, which include an observation-only
control arm.7-9
It is well known that efficacy may not translate into effectiveness in the general population.10 This may relate to the
finding that patients, practitioners, and health delivery systems in routine practice are very different from those in clinical
trials.11 Furthermore, when the evidence showing efficacy is controversial, its interpretation and subsequent adoption by
practitioners may be suboptimal.
Population-based outcome studies may be useful in evaluating the external validity of the results of clinical trials.12
We undertook a population-based study to describe adoption and outcomes of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy
for bladder cancer in the general population of Ontario. The study objectives were: 1) to explore whether the evidence of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Population

This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study to
describe management and outcome of MIBC in the
Canadian province of Ontario. Ontario has a population
of approximately 13.5 million people and a single-payer
universal health insurance program. All incident cases of
bladder cancer in Ontario with transitional cell, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell histology who underwent
cystectomy or radical RT in 1994-2008 were identified
using the Ontario Cancer Registry and linked treatment
records. Stage of disease was not routinely available in the
existing data sources; for this reason we obtained surgical
pathology reports for all cystectomy cases. Patients with
muscle-invasive urothelial cancer as per the cystectomy
pathology report were included. The primary study
objective was to describe practice patterns and outcomes
associated with perioperative chemotherapy for MIBC in
the general population. The study was approved by the
Research Ethics Board of Queen’s University.
Data Sources

The Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR) is a passive,
population-based cancer registry that captures diagnostic
and demographic information on at least 98% of all incident cases of cancer diagnosed in the province of Ontario.13 The OCR provides information regarding cancer
site/histology, date of diagnosis, demographics, and vital
status. Complete information about vital status was available to December 31, 2010, and cause of death was available to December 31, 2008. The OCR does not compile
information about extent of disease or treatment. Indicators of the socioeconomic status (SES) of the community
in which patients resided at time of diagnosis were linked
to the OCR as described previously to create SES quintiles.14 Q1 represents the communities where the poorest
20% of the Ontario population resides.
A variety of electronic administrative health databases are linked to the OCR. Records of hospitalization
from the Canadian Institute for Health Information provided information about surgical interventions and hospital care; collection of these records is known to be
consistent and complete throughout Ontario.15 Provincial physician billing records and treatment records from
Ontario’s regional cancer centers were used to identify utiCancer

Comorbidity was classified using the modified Charlson
Index based on all noncancer diagnoses recorded during
any hospital admission within 5 years prior to surgery.16
NACT was defined as any chemotherapy administered
within 16 weeks prior to surgery. ACT was defined as any
chemotherapy administered within 16 weeks after
surgery.
Statistical Analysis

Comparisons of proportions between study groups were
made using the chi-square test. Survival was determined
from date of surgery using the Kaplan-Meier technique,
and comparisons between groups were made using the
log-rank test. Factors associated with treatment practices
were evaluated by logistic regression. The association
between patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors
with overall/cancer-specific survival was evaluated using
the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The survival analyses related to ACT were restricted to patients
who did not receive NACT or preoperative radiotherapy
because information about pathologic stage for these
patients would not be reliable. To control for confounding variables when exploring the association between
ACT and survival, we also employed the propensity score
technique in the Cox proportional hazards model. The
propensity score is the probability that a patient receives
ACT, and it was modeled with observed confounding variables using the logistic regression model. The propensity
scores allowed us to create 5 propensity strata with balanced confounding variables between ACT patients and
non-ACT patients. Survival of patients treated with ACT
was compared with those without ACT within each stratum using a Cox proportional hazards model; a summary
HR combining the results across quintiles was calculated
on the basis of the stratified Cox’s PH model.17,18 Results
were considered statistically significant at P < .05. All
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Study Population

During 1994-2008, 3879 patients in Ontario underwent
cystectomy for bladder cancer, of whom 2944 patients
had muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (Supplemental

Among the 2944 muscle-invasive patients, 2273 did not receive perioperative chemotherapy. Six of these cases received preoperative radiotherapy. These
6 cases were removed from subsequent analyses because pathologic stage would not reflect true stage of disease.
b
Five hundred seventy-two patients were treated with ACT. Thirty of these were also treated with NACT. These 30 cases were removed from the ACT analyses
because pathologic stage would not reflect true stage of disease.
c
Quintile 1 includes patients who reside in neighborhoods with the lowest socioeconomic status (SES). SES data are missing for 2 patients.

Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table
1. Most patients (60%) were older than age 70, and 75%
were male. Locally advanced (T3/T4) tumors were present in 71% of patients, and 26% of patients had positive
lymph nodes. No lymph nodes were removed in 31% of
patients. Only 4% of patients (129 of 2944) received
NACT; 19% of patients (572 of 2944) were treated with
ACT. Thirty patients (1%) were treated with NACT and
ACT.

Trends in the Use of Chemotherapy

Although use of NACT remained relatively static over
time—1994-1998, 5%; 1999-2003, 3%; 2004-2008, 6%
(P 5 .004)—use of ACT increased over the study period
from 16% to 18% to 22% (P 5 .001); see Figure 1. The
chemotherapy regimen used was identifiable for 308 of
671 patients (46%) treated with NACT/ACT. Chemotherapy included cisplatin or carboplatin in 82% (253 of
308) and 14% (43 of 308) of patients, respectively.

Figure 1. Proportion of muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients treated with surgery in Ontario 1994-2008 (n 5 2944) treated

Factors associated with use of perioperative chemotherapy are shown in Table 2. In adjusted analyses,
younger age was associated with greater utilization of
NACT and ACT. Patients residing in more affluent
communities were more likely to have ACT than those
residing in lower SES communities. Pathologic characteristics were also strongly associated with use of ACT:
T3/T4 tumors (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.38-2.46), nodepositive disease (OR, 8.10; 95% CI, 6.20-10.7), and
presence of lymphovascular invasion (OR, 1.53; 95%
CI, 1.11-2.15) were all associated with greater utilization
of ACT. There was greater utilization of NACT (OR,
1.73; 95% CI, 1.18-2.55) and ACT (OR, 1.43; 95% CI,
1.12-1.83) among patients whose surgery took place at a
hospital associated with a regional cancer center.

Outcomes

Among the full study population (n 5 2944), 5-year OS
and CSS were 29% (95% CI, 28%-31%) and 33% (95%
CI, 31%-35%), respectively (Supplemental eFigure; see
online supporting information). Among NACT patients
5-year OS was 25% (95% CI, 17%-34%) and CSS was
28% (95% CI, 18%-39%); corresponding figures for

ACT patients were 29% (95% CI, 25%-33%) and 28%
(95% CI, 24%-33%), respectively.
Factors associated with OS and CSS among the
2809 ACT-eligible patients (ie, those not treated with
NACT or preoperative RT) are shown in Table 3. In
adjusted analyses greater comorbidity and advanced age
were associated with reduced OS and CSS. Higher stage
was strongly associated with inferior OS and CSS: T3/4
tumors (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.52-1.88; and HR, 1.84;
95% CI, 1.62-2.08, respectively), node-positive disease
(HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.58-1.98; and HR, 1.82; 95% CI,
1.60-2.07, respectively) or NX (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.231.58; and HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.23-1.58, respectively),
and presence of lymphovascular invasion (HR, 1.80; 95%
CI, 1.59-2.03; and HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.77-2.37,
respectively).
After controlling for relevant patient- and diseaserelated characteristics, utilization of ACT was associated
with decreased risk of death from any cause (HR, 0.71;
95% CI, 0.62-0.81) and decreased risk of death from cancer (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64-0.84). This result was consistent in the propensity score analysis in which the combined
HR across quintiles was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.62-0.80) for OS
and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.85) for CSS (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
In this large population-based study we have explored utilization of perioperative chemotherapy and outcomes among
patients with MIBC in the general population. Several important findings have emerged. First, contrary to existing
evidence and published guidelines, utilization of NACT in
routine clinical practice remains very low, whereas use of
ACT is increasing over time. Despite the increased use of
ACT, during the most recent study period (2004-2008),
only 23% of patients with resected MIBC received any
Cancer

form of perioperative chemotherapy. Second, utilization of
NACT/ACT was substantially lower among older patients,
and utilization of ACT was strongly associated with poor
prognostic pathologic findings. Third, 5-year overall survival of all NACT (25%) and ACT (29%) patients was
substantially lower than outcomes reported in the relevant
clinical trials. Finally, in adjusted analyses utilization of
ACT was associated with substantial improvement in overall survival and cancer-specific survival in the general
population.

Notes: Quintile 1 reflects the 20% of patients with the lowest propensity to have ACT.
Four of 2809 cases (0.2%) were not included in the propensity score analysis because of missing data.

The relative utilization of NACT and ACT in the
general population of Ontario is not consistent with current evidence or treatment guidelines. The MRC/
EORTC clinical trial (n 5 976) evaluated 3 cycles of
NACT or observation alone followed by each institution’s
choice of local management. The investigators recently
reported updated results showing an absolute improvement in 5-year overall survival of 6% (P 5 .037).1 A US
Intergroup trial (n 5 317) found that 3 cycles of NACT
were associated with a 14% improvement in overall survival at 5 years with borderline significance compared
with surgery alone (P 5 .06).2 A meta-analysis reported a
significant survival benefit associated with the use of
NACT (5% improvement in OS).3 On the basis of these
data, multiple guidelines (including Cancer Care Ontario) have endorsed NACT.19,20
The evidence in support of ACT for bladder cancer
is less robust, with many of the RCTs plagued by small
sample sizes and methodologic limitations. Two metaanalyses suggested improved outcomes with ACT. Using
individual patient data from 6 RCTs (491 patients), the
ABC Meta-Analysis Collaboration reported that ACT
was associated with a 25% reduction in the risk of death
(HR, 0.75; P 5 .019), translating into an absolute
improvement in overall survival of 9% at 3 years.4 Ruggeri
et al performed a literature-based pooled analysis of 350
patients from RCTs and found improved OS and diseasefree survival with ACT (RR, 0.74; P 5 .001; and RR,
0.65; P < 0.001, respectively).5 Despite the more limited
evidence and the lack of strong endorsement in published
guidelines,20,21 the clinical community appears to have
accepted the efficacy of ACT. This dichotomy is nowhere
more apparent than in Ontario, where the provincial clinical practice guideline21 and a commentary published
from Ontario’s preeminent cancer center22 within
1636

1 month of each other have diametrically opposed
recommendations. Furthermore, all 3 large contemporary
RCTs initiated to address the survival impact of ACT in
MIBC have closed prematurely because of poor accrual.79
It is very unlikely that any future RCT evaluating ACT
in bladder cancer will have an observation-only treatment
arm. The use of carboplatin in 14% of ACT-treated
patients in our current study likely relates to postoperative
renal dysfunction. It is worth noting that there are no data
to support the use of carboplatin-based ACT in this
population.
Although the observed practice patterns in Ontario
are not congruent with treatment guidelines, they are consistent with other retrospective studies. Three reports have
evaluated use of perioperative chemotherapy in patients
with bladder cancer in large population-based samples.
David et al used records from the National Cancer Data
Base in the United States to describe treatment patterns
for 7161 patients with stage III bladder cancer diagnosed
between 1998 and 2003.23 They found that 10% of
patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas only
1% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a modest
increase in use of perioperative chemotherapy over time,
from 11% in 1998 to 17% in 2003. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare
database, Schrag and colleagues identified 4664 patients
aged 65 years and older with MIBC diagnosed between
1991 and 199924; 11% of patients with stage III disease
had perioperative chemotherapy. In a related study by
Porter and colleagues using SEER-Medicare data (19922002), perioperative chemotherapy was delivered in 18%
and 23% of patients with stage II and III bladder cancer,
respectively.25 Although these studies provide insights
into the use of chemotherapy for MIBC in the elderly
population, our study is the first to evaluate use of
Cancer

perioperative chemotherapy for bladder cancer in a contemporary population-based sample. Svatek et al reported
a retrospective series of 3497 patients treated with radical
cystectomy at 11 academic centers during 1979-2008.26
ACT was used in 24% of patients and was associated with
improved OS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.97). However,
this study was limited by the lack of information regarding patient comorbidity and also by referral and selection
biases inherent to institution-based case series.
In adjusted analyses we found a substantial and
significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.71) and CSS
(HR, 0.73) associated with ACT. These results were
consistent in the Cox model as well as the propensity
score analysis. Given the very high risk of death in this
patient population, a HR of 0.71 translates to a very
large absolute improvement in survival, as demonstrated
for the following hypothetical patients. The 5-year OS
of a 54-year-old man with no comorbidity and a pT3,
node-positive tumor with surgery alone is 15% (95%
CI, 10%-23%). His predicted survival increases to 26%
(95% CI, 20%-34%) if treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. A 68-year-old woman with moderate comorbidity and a pT2, NX tumor has a 5-year OS of 49%
(95% CI, 42%-58%) with surgery alone; this increases
to 61% (95% CI, 54%-69%) with ACT. This magnitude of effect is comparable to the benefits associated
with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast, colorectal, and
non–small cell lung cancers which are accepted standards of care. The effect size of ACT on OS observed in
our study (HR, 0.70) is comparable to the results
reported in a meta-analysis,4 a pooled report of RCTs,5
and the institutional series reported by Svatek.26
The 5-year OS of NACT patients (26%) in Ontario
is much lower than the survival reported from the pivotal
RCTs of NACT (49% and 57%).1,2 Likewise, OS at 5
years among our ACT patients was 29% but was closer to
50% in the updated ABC meta-analysis.4 Several potential factors may explain the inferior outcomes observed in
our population-based series compared with the results of
clinical trial cohorts, including selection and referral
biases, differences in surgical technique, and the known
association between greater cystectomy case volumes and
improved outcomes.27 Ongoing analyses will explore the
quality of lymph node dissection in this study population
and how it might explain the observed outcomes.
Although our study provides detailed data regarding
the use of perioperative chemotherapy for bladder cancer
in a contemporary population-based cohort, several methodologic limitations merit comment. Although the electronic data sources used in this study describe general
Cancer

aspects of disease, treatment, and outcome for all patients
in the province, detailed information related to chemotherapy dose/cycles, treatment toxicity, performance status, and renal function is not available and limits our
ability to evaluate the appropriateness of case selection for
NACT/ACT. It is possible that other unmeasured confounders may have contributed to the observed survival
benefit with ACT. When there is marked change in practice over a short period, it is possible to measure effectiveness by looking at population-level outcomes among all
patients before and after the change in practice.28,29 However, this was not the case in the current study, as there
was no pivotal shift in practice at a specific point. Accordingly, in addition to traditional Cox analyses, we used a
propensity score analysis to adjust for potential confounders. A potential example of residual confounding relates to
the possibility of misclassification and stage migration of
NX patients. However, our results remained robust in
Cox analyses stratified for surgical hospital and surgical
case volume (data not shown). Despite these potential
limitations our results are internally consistent (ie, Cox
analysis and propensity score analysis) and are also consistent with the effect size reported in 2 studies pooling
RCT data4,5 and an institution-based retrospective cohort
study.26 Finally, because our study population was identified on the basis of the presence of MIBC in cystectomy
pathology reports, we would not have captured outcomes
for the small proportion of patients whose only evidence
of MIBC was at the time of transurethral resection.
In summary, our study demonstrates low utilization
of perioperative chemotherapy for bladder cancer in the
general population. Our results suggest that ACT is associated with a substantial survival benefit in the general
population. Given the potential for perioperative chemotherapy to improve patient outcomes, further efforts are
needed to understand reasons for underutilization. Efforts
in knowledge translation are required to better understand
possible barriers to care. Finally, the comparatively poor
outcomes of patients in routine practice compared with
survival reported in clinical trials suggest a substantial efficacy–effectiveness gap that requires further attention to
improve the outcomes of patients with MIBC in the
general population.
