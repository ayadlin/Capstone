BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in the growth and metastatic progression of melanoma. Exposure of melanoma cells to chemotherapy induces VEGF overproduction, which in turn may allow melanoma cells to evade cell death and become chemotherapy resistant.
Therefore, in patients with metastatic melanoma, the combination of chemotherapy with an agent that specifically targets VEGF might be able to control tumor growth and progression more effectively than chemotherapy alone. METHODS: A 2-stage phase 2 clinical trial was conducted in patients with unresectable
stage IV (metastatic) melanoma to assess antitumor activity and the toxicity profile of the combination of
carboplatin (area under the curve 6 iv on Day 1 of a 28-day cycle), paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 iv on Days 1, 8,
and 15), and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg iv on Days 1 and 15). Treatment was continued until progression or
intolerable toxicity. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (62.3% male) were enrolled. Nine (17%) patients achieved
partial remission, and another 30 (57%) achieved stable disease for at least 8 weeks. Median progressionfree survival and median overall survival were 6 months and 12 months, respectively. One patient died after
8 treatment cycles from intracranial hemorrhage into undiagnosed brain metastases. The most common
severe (grade 3) toxicities were neutropenia (53%), thrombocytopenia (11%), hypertension (9%), and anemia (8%). CONCLUSIONS: This combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab appears to be
moderately well tolerated and clinically beneficial in patients with metastatic melanoma. Further study of

Original Article

The growth of solid tumors depends to a large extent on
1

angiogenesis. After a tumor grows beyond 100 to 200
lm in size, diffusion alone is insufficient to maintain tumor oxygenation, and the development of new blood vessels becomes necessary for continued tumor growth.
Angiogenesis involves the recruitment of sprouting vessels
from existing blood vessels and incorporation of endothelial progenitors into the growing vascular bed.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell-specific mitogen, is the most potent, specific, and well-defined soluble mediator of angiogenesis.2
VEGF appears to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis,
growth, and metastatic progression of melanoma.3-8 AntiVEGF therapy has been shown to inhibit growth in
human melanoma xenografts.9 In addition, exposure of
melanoma cells with a nonaggressive phenotype to dacarbazine (DTIC) results in the acquisition of a much more
tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype,10 at least in part
through overproduction of VEGF, which may render
both endothelial and cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy through a variety of mechanisms: 1) enhancement of
tumor growth through induction of angiogenesis; 2)
impairment of delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor
through increase in interstitial fluid pressure11; 3) protection of tumor-associated endothelial cells against cytotoxicity12; and 4) initiation of autocrine survival signals in
cancer cells.13,14
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds
VEGF-A (the most common VEGF isoform) and blocks
binding to its receptors.15 In comparison with conventional chemotherapy, the antiangiogenic effects of bevacizumab are indirect (through inhibition of VEGF) and
not necessarily lethal, and this is probably why as a single agent, bevacizumab is not very active in patients with
metastatic melanoma (and other malignancies).16 However, the addition of bevacizumab to conventional
chemotherapy has been shown to control tumor growth
and progression more effectively than chemotherapy
alone in patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)17 and colon cancer.18,19 This is probably
explained by bevacizumab’s ability to dampen (or even
block) the effects of VEGF up-regulation induced by
chemotherapy.
Because of the role that VEGF appears to play in the
resistance of malignant melanoma to chemotherapy and
120

the proven synergy between chemotherapy and bevacizumab in other malignancies, we decided to explore the
safety and efficacy of a combination of carboplatin and
paclitaxel with bevacizumab in patients with metastatic
melanoma. Although the combination of paclitaxel and
carboplatin is not commonplace in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, we selected this chemotherapy regimen
because its use in combination with bevacizumab had already been shown to be clinically beneficial in patients
with metastatic NSCLC,17 and data from prospective
studies20-23 as well as our own experience with this combination24 suggested that its efficacy in patients with metastatic melanoma was at least comparable to that of DTIC
or temozolomide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic melanoma. Additional eligibility criteria included bidimensionally measurable
disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST), Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0-2, life expectancy 4 months, and adequate hematologic, hepatic,
and renal function (including urinary excretion of <1g of
protein per day if urine protein to creatinine [UPC] ratio
>0.5). Exclusion criteria included: prior chemotherapy
with carboplatin, paclitaxel or agents known to disrupt
VEGF activity; known central nervous system metastases;
radiographic evidence of tumor invasion of major blood
vessels or a hollow viscus; grade 2 peripheral neuropathy;
ongoing need for full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulation; active bleeding or bleeding diathesis; serious, nonhealing wound; poorly controlled high blood pressure
despite appropriate treatment; and major surgical procedure, significant traumatic injury, abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess 4
weeks before registration. All patients provided written
informed consent in accordance with institutional review
board requirements. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating centers and conducted in accordance with the US Food and Drug
Administration’s Good Clinical Practice requirements.

Study Design and Treatment
Patients were treated with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg iv on
Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 iv
on Days 1, 8 and 15, and carboplatin area under the curve
(AUC) 6 iv on Day 1. Paclitaxel was administered over 1
hour after completion of bevacizumab infusion. Carboplatin was administered over 15 to 30 minutes after completion of the paclitaxel infusion. On Day 1 of the cycle,
dose reductions were permitted based on interval toxicity,
including febrile neutropenia, absolute neutrophil count
<1000/mm3, platelet count <75,000/mm3, grade 3 of 4
nausea or vomiting not controlled by antiemetics, and
grade 2 motor or sensory neuropathy. Paclitaxel and carboplatin were held on Day 1 if absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) was <1500/mm3, platelet count was <100,000/
mm3, or there were any grade 3 or 4 toxicities until counts
recovered or toxicity returned to baseline or grade 1. If
ANC was <1000/mm3 or platelet count was <50,000/
mm3 on Days 8 or 15, paclitaxel was omitted. If platelet
count was between 50,000 and 75,000/mm3 on Days 8 or
15, the dose of paclitaxel was reduced. A maximum of 2
dose reductions were allowed for both carboplatin and
paclitaxel. The first dose reduction resulted in a target
AUC of 5 for carboplatin and a dose of 65 mg/m2 for
paclitaxel; the second dose reduction resulted in a target
AUC of 4 for carboplatin and a dose of 50 mg/m2 for
paclitaxel. Bevacizumab was administered by intravenous
infusion over 90 minutes. If the first infusion was well tolerated, subsequent infusions were shortened to a minimum of 30 minutes. The dose of bevacizumab was not
modified during this study. All patients received standard
supportive care, including antiemetics, antibiotics, and
blood and platelet transfusions, as appropriate. Granulocyte colony-stimulating and recombinant erythropoietin
were administered at the discretion of the treating
physician.

Study Parameters
Within 14 days of registration, patients underwent a complete physical exam, assessment of ECOG PS, complete
blood cell count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel
including lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), measurement of
UPC ratio, and baseline radiographic tumor assessment.
All patients underwent a brain imaging to rule out brain

metastases. Blood was also drawn to measure baseline
VEGF levels. After initiation of treatment, physical
exams, toxicity evaluations, and serum chemistries were
repeated every 4 weeks. CBC was measured weekly during
treatment. UPC ratio was measured 48 hours before
each bevacizumab infusion. Additional blood was drawn
for correlative studies (VEGF levels) on Day 1 of cycles 2,
3, 4, and every even cycle thereafter during treatment and
at discontinuation of treatment. Tumor status was
assessed every 8 weeks during treatment using RECIST
criteria.

Quantification of Plasma VEGF-A
Blood samples for analysis of plasma VEGF-A levels were
collected before initiation of therapy and before every subsequent cycle of therapy (every 4 weeks). Platelet-poor
plasma was collected from heparinized Vacutainer tubes
(Becton Dickinson, East Rutherford, NJ) and immediately frozen for storage at 80 C until analysis. To minimize interassay variability, all samples were analyzed in
the same assay using a commercial human VEGF-A
enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay kit, following manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis,
Minn).

Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint of this trial was the 8-week eventfree survival rate, which is defined as the percentage of eligible patients who remain progression-free and on study
treatment for at least 56 days postregistration divided by
the number of eligible patients who began treatment. A
Simon 2-stage phase 2 clinical trial design enrolling a
minimum of 20 and a maximum of 47 eligible patients
was chosen to test whether the true 8-week event-free rate
was at most 35% against the alternative hypothesis that
the true 8-week event-free rate was at least 55%.25 If at
most 720 of the first 20 eligible patients remained progression-free and on treatment for at least 8 weeks, the regimen would not be recommended for further testing in
this patient population. If at least 21 of the 47 eligible
patients remained progression-free and on treatment for
at least 8 weeks without excessive toxicity, the regimen
would be recommended for further investigation in this
patient population. With the significance level set at 0.10,
121

Original Article

the power to detect that the 8-week event-free rate was
greater than 35% when it was at least 55% was 90%.
The trial was designed with a stopping rule for excessive toxicity, which required that enrollment be suspended, adverse event data examined, and a trial
recommendation formulated for consideration by the
data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) and cancer therapy evaluation program (CTEP). Excessive toxicity was considered to be when 3 or more of the first 10
study patients or 30% or more of study patients at any
point after 11 patients have been enrolled develop a grade
3þ nonhematologic toxicity or grade 4þ hematologic
toxicity considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely
related to treatment.
A 90% confidence interval for the 8-week event-free
rate was constructed using the Duffy-Santner approach.26
Tumor response rate was defined as the number of
patients whose disease status met the RECIST criteria for
complete or partial response on 2 consecutive evaluations
8 weeks apart (as determined by patient’s institution) divided by the number of eligible patients who started study
treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) time was
defined as the time elapsed from registration to progression of disease or death without prior documentation of
progressive disease. Survival time was defined as the time
elapsed from registration to death due to any cause. Time
to event distributions was estimated using the KaplanMeier method.27 Toxicities were graded and attribution
assigned by treating physicians using the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events version 3.0. A Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to examine the association between tumor
burden and pretreatment VEGF levels.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Fifty-three patients (62.3% male) were enrolled into the
study between December 30, 2005 and November 3,
2006. None of the patients was found to be ineligible or
canceled participation before the start of treatment after
signing the consent form. The characteristics of these
patients are presented in Table 1. The median age at
enrollment was 55 years (range, 30-84 years). Prior therapies included immunotherapy (52.8%), radiation therapy

patients (62.2%). Nineteen patients (36%) received GCSF support. The most common reason for dose reduction/omission was severe hematology toxicity. The most
common severe (grade 3) toxicities (possibly, probably,
or definitely related to treatment) were neutropenia
(53%), leukopenia (38%), thrombocytopenia (11%),
anemia (8%), hypertension (9%), nausea (6%), hypersensitivity (6%), and fatigue (6%) (Table 2). There were 40
instances of hemorrhaging reported among 31 patients.

Clinical Efficacy
Patients were followed for a minimum of 8.5 months or
until death. Among the 53 patients enrolled, 9 (17%)
achieved a partial remission, and an additional 30 (57%)
completed 2 cycles of treatment with stable disease. No
complete remissions were observed. Thus, the 8-week
event-free rate among these 53 patients was 74% (90%
confidence interval, 62%-83%). Of the 13 patients who
had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant or metastatic
setting, 3 achieved a partial remission, and an additional 7
patients completed 2 cycles of treatment with stable
disease.
At last follow-up, 4 patients are alive without disease
progression, 9 are alive with disease progression, and 40
have died of disease. The estimated median PFS was 181
days (6 months) (Fig. 1) and median overall survival (OS)
was 366 days (12 months) (Fig. 2).

Tumor Response by M Stage
Tumor response among the 10 patients with M1 or M2
disease was such that 1 patient had a partial remission and
4 completed 2 cycles of treatment with stable disease. Tumor response among the 42 patients with M3 disease (29
with LDH > upper limit of normal [ULN]) was such that
8 patients (2 with LDH > ULN) had a partial remission
and 26 (14 with LDH > ULN) completed 2 cycles of
treatment with stable disease.

Changes in Plasma VEGF Levels
Thirty-one patients had pretreatment VEGF-A levels
measured. The median pretreatment VEGF-A level was
181.1 pg/mL (range,1.3-1938.6). There was weak positive correlation between tumor burden (estimated by the
sum of the greatest diameters of the target lesions) and
pretreatment VEGF-A levels (rho ¼ 0.33) (Fig. 3). Of the
29 patients who had pretreatment and week 4 VEGF-A
measurements, 80% had VEGF-A levels below 85 pg/mL
at week 4 (Fig. 4). All of these 29 patients have had progression of disease. The percent change in VEGF-A levels
after 4 weeks of treatment was not found to be associated
with the amount of time the patient remained progression-free (Spearman rho ¼ 0.090).

DISCUSSION
The results of the present study suggest that the combination of carboplatin, weekly paclitaxel, and biweekly bevaci124

zumab has therapeutic activity in patients with metastatic
melanoma. Treatment was moderately well tolerated with
the incidence and severity of nausea/vomiting, neuropathy,
and renal toxicity at levels comparable to those observed
with chemotherapy alone. The percentage of patients who
developed severe (grade 3þ) bleeding events with this regimen was 2%. This percentage is similar to the 3.7% (36 of
963) found by Scappaticci et al in a pooled analysis of 5
randomized trials of chemotherapy in combination with
bevacizumab.28 The PFS and OS observed in our study
compare favorably with those seen with single-agent temozolomide or dacarbazine (Table 3) as well as in other phase
2 studies conducted by the cooperative cancer groups in
the United States.29 Obviously, without a well-designed
randomized clinical trial of carboplatin and paclitaxel with
or without bevacizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma, it is impossible to know the relative value of adding
bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel in this patient
population. However, because the PFS and OS observed
in our study also compare favorably to those seen in other
prospective studies of the combination of carboplatin and
bevacizumab (Table 3), and the addition of bevacizumab
to carboplatin and paclitaxel has already been shown to
increase the efficacy of this combination in patients with
NSCLC, we believe that further study in the form of a
randomized clinical trial is justified.

Siegel et al reported that the serum VEGF-A levels
of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
receiving bevacizumab significantly decreased after 8
weeks of treatment and then increased to near pretreatment levels at the time of progression.30 This study also
found decreases in serum VEGF-A levels with 4 weeks of
chemotherapy and bevacizumab, but serum VEGF-A
levels remained at these low levels at disease progression.
The results of phase 2 studies of different schedules
of the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel in
patients with metastatic melanoma vary widely (Table 3).
In the absence of data from randomized clinical trials, it is
unclear which carboplatin/paclitaxel schedule is better or
even best suited for combination with bevacizumab. In
patients with metastatic NSCLC, carboplatin, paclitaxel,
and bevacizumab are given every 3 weeks.17 Clearly, paclitaxel/carboplatin administered every 3 weeks appears to
have clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma.23 For our study, we chose to deliver paclitaxel on a
weekly schedule in an attempt to increase the therapeutic
index of the study regimen and enhance the intrinsic antiangiogenic properties of paclitaxel.31 To accomplish these
goals, we considered delivering both carboplatin and
paclitaxel on a weekly schedule. However, the poor results
obtained by Zimpfer-Rechner et al with weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel made this schedule less appealing.22 In addition, at the time of designing our study, data from a
randomized phase 2 trial in patients with advanced
NSCLC suggested that a ‘‘hybrid’’ schedule similar to the
1 used in our study had a better therapeutic index relative
to weekly therapy.32

In our study, we used the paclitaxel (Taxol) formulation of paclitaxel. However, it is not entirely clear that this
is the best formulation of paclitaxel, particularly when
used in combination with antiangiogenic agents. There
has been concern about the possibility that clinically relevant concentrations of the formulation vehicle Cremophor-EL in paclitaxel (Taxol) could impair the
antiangiogenic effects of paclitaxel.33 To explore this
hypothesis, Ng et al compared the antitumor effects of
metronomic and maximum tolerated dose ABI-007, the
albumin-bound, Cremofor-EL-free formulation of paclitaxel, and paclitaxel (Taxol) in 2 cancer xenograft models.34 Metronomic ABI-007, but not paclitaxel (Taxol),
significantly suppressed tumor growth in their animal
models. Moreover, the antitumor effect of minimally
toxic metronomic ABI-007 approximated that of the
maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel (Taxol). Weekly
ABI-007 has already been shown to be well tolerated and
able to produce long-term disease control in patients with
metastatic melanoma who have experienced rapid progression on other treatments.35 The clinical utility of the
combination of ABI-007 and carboplatin in patients with
metastatic melanoma is currently being evaluated by the
North Central Cancer Treatment Group (protocol
N057E).
In summary, the results of our study suggest that the
combination of chemotherapy with an agent that specifically targets VEGF might be a valid therapeutic strategy
for patients with metastatic melanoma. Further study is
necessary to determine the relative value of bevacizumab
in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, the best
