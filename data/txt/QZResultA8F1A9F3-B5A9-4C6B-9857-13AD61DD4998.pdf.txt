Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Many tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are silenced through synergistic layers of epigenetic
regulation including abnormal DNA hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands, repressive
chromatin modifications and enhanced nucleosome deposition over transcription start sites. The
protein complexes responsible for silencing of many of such TSGs remain to be identified. Our
previous work demonstrated that multiple silenced TSGs in colorectal cancer cells can be partially
reactivated by DNA demethylation in cells disrupted for the DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3B
(DNMT1 and 3B) or by DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi). Herein, we used proteomic and functional
genetic approaches to identify additional proteins that cooperate with DNMTs in silencing these
key silenced TSGs in colon cancer cells. We discovered that DNMTs and the core components of
the NuRD (Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) nucleosome remodeling complex,
chromo domain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)
occupy the promoters of several of these hypermethylated TSGs and physically and functionally
interact to maintain their silencing. Consistent with this, we find an inverse relationship between
expression of HDAC1 and 2 and these TSGs in a large panel of primary colorectal tumors. We
demonstrate that DNMTs and NuRD cooperate to maintain the silencing of several negative
regulators of the WNT and other signaling pathways. We find that depletion of CHD4 is
synergistic with DNMT inhibition in reducing the viability of colon cancer cells in correlation

treatment of colon cancer. Since CHD4 has ATPase activity, our data identify CHD4 as a
potentially novel drug target in cancer.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancer often results from a combination of activation of oncogenes and loss of function of
tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). In many cases, the activity of TSGs is not lost by mutation,
but rather these genes are silenced through epigenetic mechanisms which include DNA
methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome remodeling, that often act in concert to
provide transcriptional repression.1-3 The resultant chromatin landscape can include histone
hypoacetylation and methylation of H3K9, H3K27 and H4K20.2 Hypermethylation of
promoter CpG islands often occurs in conjunction with this repressive chromatin
environment and frequently coincides with nucleosome deposition over transcription start
sites, leading to occlusion of transcription factor binding sites and impedance of
transcription initiation.4-6

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The mechanism of transcriptional repression mediated by the DNA methylation machinery
involves with both methylated DNA and the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) proteins.7
Methylated DNA is recognized by methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs) such as
MBD2 and MeCP2, which guide protein complexes with chromatin remodeling and/or
histone modifying activity, including the SIN3A, CoREST, SWI-SNF and NuRD (Mi-2/
nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex, to specific sequences in the genome.8-11
The subunits of the NuRD complex include the helicase-like ATPases CHD3/4 (chromo
domain helicase DNA-binding protein 3/4), histone deacetylases HDAC1/2, the metastasisassociated proteins MTA1/2/3 and histone chaperone proteins RBBP4/7 and GATAD2A/B,
and methyl-DNA binding proteins MBD2/3, of which MBD2 recruits NuRD to
hypermethylated sequences to reposition nucleosomes.11-13 In addition to its own
transcriptional repression activity, the DNMTs can also function as scaffolds to recruit other
repressor proteins. For example, DNMTs can cooperate with the ATP-dependent chromatin
remodeler LSH in transcriptional repression.14 Conversely, proteins that interact with or
modify histones may recruit the DNA methylation machinery to aid in transcriptional
regulation. Several Polycomb Group complex constituents, such as EZH2 and CBX7, may
recruit DNMTs to cooperate in stable silencing of Polycomb Group-target genes.15,16 DNAbinding transcriptional factors such as the oncogenic fusion protein PML-RARα can recruit
DNMTs, Polycomb Group proteins and the NuRD complex to induce transcriptional
repression of the TSG RARβ.17,18
Given that TSGs are often inactivated by synergistic layers of epigenetic regulation,
effective reactivation of silenced TSGs may require inhibition of multiple epigenetic
processes. Many silenced TSGs that control critical regulatory pathways in colorectal

tumors, including the secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) family, which encode for
potent inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway, and the tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), which inhibits metastasis, are partially reactivated in the
colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 cells that are hypomorphic for the maintenance DNA
methyltransferase DNMT1 (~10% expression) and deleted for the de novo methyltransferase
DNMT3B (DKO) or by drugs that both inhibit and deplete DNMTs such as 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine (DAC), in association with promoter demethylation.19 All these results
suggest that DNMTs have a major role in the maintenance of TSG silencing. Our earlier
work demonstrated that HDACi trichostatin A (TSA) and DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi)
synergistically reactivate many of the above-mentioned TSGs when combined.20,21 We
previously found that TSGs, which are only partially DNA methylated and not fully
silenced, but expressed at low levels, are induced by TSA treatment alone, whereas more
fully DNA methylated and silenced genes cannot be reactivated by TSA alone.20,21
However, all of these TSGs can be partially reactivated by DNMTi and fully reactivated by
combining DNMTi and HDACi, suggesting that DNMTs and yet to be identified HDAC(s)
cooperate in the maintenance of TSG silencing.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the present study, we have used two independent approaches to identify the protein
complexes that cooperate with DNMTs in repression of above-mentioned TSGs in colorectal
cancer (CRC) cell lines. We demonstrate a novel cooperation between DNMTs and the
chromatin remodeling complex NuRD, which maintains the aberrant silencing of key TSGs
including SFRPs and TIMP3. As such, our findings demonstrate that these TSGs are
silenced by three synergistic layers of epigenetic regulation. Our work also identifies
HDAC1 and 2 as the relevant drug targets among the larger HDAC family and identifies
CHD4 as a potentially novel therapeutic target.

RESULTS
DNMT inhibition and knockdown of HDAC1 and 2 synergize in reactivating TSGs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We previously conducted a genomic screen for genes upregulated by DAC and TSA in the
human CRC cell line RKO.21 The genes upregulated by the combined DAC and TSA
treatment include TIMP2, TIMP3 and SFRP1. Further work revealed that three other
members of the SFRP gene family (SFRP2, SFRP4 and SFRP5) are also methylated and
silenced in RKO and HCT116 cells.22 Interestingly, the expression of TIMP3 and
SFRP1/2/4/5 is restored in HCT116 DKO cells in which two DNMTs (DNMT1 and
DNMT3B) are genetically disrupted and DNA methylation is almost depleted. This result
suggested that the epigenetic silencing of these TSGs largely relies on the DNMTs and/or
DNA methylation.22
In the present study, to further characterize the molecular mechanism of the cooperation
between DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation in TSG silencing, we selected
SFRPs and TIMPs as our guide genes as they are defined DNA hypermethylated genes in
RKO and HCT116 cells. According to their different responses to TSA, we divided these
genes into two groups. Group 1 genes (SFRP1 and TIMP2) could be partially reactivated by
treatment with TSA alone, whereas group 2 genes (TIMP3, SFRP2 and SFRP5) could not be
activated by TSA alone (Figure 1a). Both groups could be reactivated in a synergistic

fashion by the combined treatment (Figure 1a). We set out to identify the TSA-sensitive
HDAC(s) responsible for this epigenetic silencing. RKO cells were transfected with siRNA
pools targeting 11 class I and II HDACs and cultured in the absence or presence of DAC.
We gathered data for TSG reactivation for those siRNA pools that induced >70%
knockdown of the target HDACs (Figure 1a; Supplementary Figure S1A). Based on our
cutoff, there was some basal expression of group 1 genes SFRP1 and TIMP2. Concordantly,
group 1 but not group 2 TSGs could be partially reactivated by TSA treatment alone but also
by depletion of HDAC1, which was enhanced further by concomitant knockdown of HDAC2
(Figure 1a: group 1). DAC treatment in combination with depletion of HDAC1 resulted in a
strongly increased reactivation of both group 1 and group 2 TSGs tested, and this was
enhanced even further when HDAC2 was simultaneously knocked down, indicating a major
role for these two HDACs in the silencing of our selected TSGs (Figure 1a: group 2;
Supplementary Figure S1B). All siRNAs targeting HDAC1 and HDAC2 potently knocked
down their target mRNA, and each HDAC1 siRNA reactivated TSGs, arguing against offtarget effects (Supplementary Figures S1C and D). However, as 70% knockdown of some
HDACs may be insufficient to result in a loss-of-function phenotype, we cannot exclude the
possibility that other HDACs may also cooperate with DNMTs to mediate epigenetic TSG
silencing.
We also examined the same panel of TSGs in HCT116 cells, except TIMP2, which is not
DNA hypermethylated and is basally expressed.21 Similarly to RKO cells, the depletion of
both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in HCT116 cells acted in synergy with DAC in the reactivation of
the four TSGs tested (Figure 1b). We note that, although their combined depletion also
enhanced DAC-induced TSG reactivation, knockdown of HDAC1 or HDAC2 alone was not
sufficient to reactivate TSGs in HCT116 cells (Figure 1b). In this regard, and consistent with
previous studies23 this may be explained, in part, by our finding of a reciprocal
compensatory mechanism linking HDAC1 and HDAC2. Thus, knockdown of HDAC1 leads
to induction of HDAC2 protein levels and vice versa (Figures 1b and c).23,24 Alternatively,
the threshold of HDAC1/2 proteins to maintain TSG silencing may be different across
different cancer cell lines. We conclude that depletion of HDAC1 and 2 acts in a synergistic
fashion with DAC to reactivate our selected TSGs in CRC cells.
An inverse relationship between HDAC1 and 2 expression and TSGs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we studied expression of HDAC1 and 2 and our panel of TSGs in 396 early stage
primary CRCs.25 Among the seven TSGs we examined, we found a statistically significant
inverse relationship between HDAC1 expression and five TSGs and a similar inverse
relationship between HDAC2 expression and three TSGs (Table 1; Figures 1d and e). These
data demonstrate a strong inverse relationship between HDAC1 and to lesser extent HDAC2
and expression of key TSGs, in concordance with our finding that HDAC1 has a significant
role in TSG silencing in RKO cells. Interestingly, HDAC1 is overexpressed in many cancers
and this increased expression was associated with poor clinical outcome.26,27 We
hypothesize that HDAC1 overexpression may contribute to tumorigenesis by repression of
key TSGs.

HDAC1 requires the NuRD complex for silencing a subset of TSGs HDACs lack substrate
specificity for their targets as they do not discriminate between individual lysine residues.28
However, the specificity of HDACs can be guided by association with other proteins.
HDAC1 and 2 are core subunits of the repressor complexes such as CoREST and NuRD,
which, as discussed previously, can be targeted to methylated DNA. We investigated the
involvement of these complexes in TSG silencing by knocking down their essential
components. All siRNA pools induced >60% knockdown of their targets (Figure 2a, left).
Knockdown of CHD3 or RCOR1 failed to enhance DAC-induced re-expression of three
TSGs (Figure 2a, right). However, the CHD4 siRNA pool potently reactivated these silenced
TSGs in combination with DAC treatment (Figure 2a; Supplementary Figure S2A). We
found three individual CHD4 siRNAs, each of which depleted CHD4 mRNA, but not
HDAC1 mRNA, that were able to reactivate TSGs (Supplementary Figures S2B–D). Thus,
NuRD is a major suppressor of these three TSGs. Next, we determined whether
overexpression of mouse Hdac1, which is not targeted by the human-specific HDAC1#1
siRNA, was able to reconstitute TSG repression in RKO cells depleted for HDAC1 or
CHD4. RKO cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA, human HDAC1#1 siRNA or
CHD4 siRNA pool, split, treated with DAC and transduced with plasmids overexpressing
GFP or mouse Hdac1. Indeed, overexpression of mouse Hdac1 restores the repression of
three selected TSGs in RKO cells depleted for human HDAC1 (Figure 2b). Importantly,
HDAC1 appears to require the NuRD complex for silencing of these three TSGs, since
overexpression of mouse Hdac1 could not restore TSG suppression in cells depleted for
CHD4 and treated with DAC (Figure 2b). In summary, these data show that HDAC1/2
functionally cooperate with DNMTs in the silencing of a subset of TSGs, a process in which
the NuRD complex plays a major role.
DNMTs physically interact with the NuRD complex

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to our siRNA screen, we took a biochemical approach to identify novel protein
complexes that cooperate with DNMTs in TSG silencing. Endogenous DNMT1-containing
protein complexes were isolated from HCT116 cells by immunoprecipitation and DNMT1interacting partners were identified by mass spectrometry. Besides known DNMT1
interactors including PCNA, PARP1 and G9a, we detected many components of the NuRD
complex: CHD4, MBD3, MTA1/2, GATAD2A/B, suggesting that DNMT1 interacts with
NuRD (Figure 3a; Supplementary Table S1).29-31 We confirmed these interactions in
reciprocal endogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The NuRD subunits CHD4,
HDAC1/2 and MTA1/2 co-immunoprecipitated with DNMT1 (Figure 3b, left). Conversely,
DNMT1 co-immunoprecipitated with these NuRD subunits (Figure 3b, right). We also
tested whether DNMT3B can associate with NuRD. Because HCT116 cells express very
low levels of DNMT3B, we transiently expressed a FLAG-tagged DNMT3B construct in
HCT116 DNMT3B KO cells and found that seven NuRD subunits co-immunoprecipitated
with exogenous DNMT3B (Figure 3c). Finally, we were also able to find physical
interactions between DNMT1 and NuRD in RKO cells (Supplementary Figure S3).
Together, these data demonstrate the existence of two novel DNMT–NuRD interactions:
DNMT1–NuRD and DNMT3B–NuRD.

Differential cooperation between NuRD and DNMTs in the maintenance of TSG silencing

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As discussed above, the SFRP family members and TIMP3 are partially reactivated in
HCT116 DKO cells.22,32 Because both methylated DNA and DNMT proteins are largely
depleted in DKO cells, one important question is whether NuRD can functionally cooperate
with DNMT proteins in addition to methylated DNA. To address this question, we took
advantage of the HCT116 DNMT1 hypomorphic cells (DNMT1 KO) or DNMT3B KO cells
in which one of these two DNMT proteins is largely depleted but the DNA methylation
pattern and the silencing status of TSGs are well maintained.19 We then tested whether
disruption of the NuRD complex in these two DNMT mutant cell lines can abolish the
silencing of our selected TSGs. We analyzed the expression of these TSGs in CHD4
knockdown of the three isogenic HCT116 cell lines (Figures 3d and e). Although we did not
observe the synergy of CHD4 KD and DNMT depletion in the reactivation of SFRP1/5
(Supplementary Figure S4), SFRP2 and SFRP4 were strongly enhanced in reactivation by
CHD4 depletion in DNMT3B KO but not in DNMT1 KO cells. In contrast, TIMP3 was
strongly enhanced in reactivation by CHD4 knockdown in DNMT1 KO cells but not in
DNMT3B KO cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that in addition to its role as a
methylated DNA reader, the NuRD complex can cooperate with DNMT1 or DNMT3B
protein to maintain the silencing of different subset of TSGs.
DNMTs and NuRD occupy promoters of TSGs
We subsequently investigated whether the NuRD complex and DNMT proteins directly
associates with promoters of TSGs by analyzing their occupancy at TSG promoters with
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We found that DNMT1, DNMT3B, HDAC1 and
CHD4 occupy the promoters of all six TSGs tested in both HCT116 and RKO cells (Figures
4a and b). As the ChIP signal of CHD4 is much stronger than the ChIP signals of other
proteins, the occupancy of DNMTs to these TSGs is more evident in Supplementary Figure
S5 which is the expanded view of Figures 4a and b.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next used re-ChIP to examine whether DNMT–NuRD interactions occur directly on
chromatin surrounding the promoters of our selected TSGs. In the attempt to establish the
DNMT re-ChIP assay, we noticed that the elution efficiency of traditional re-ChIP elution
buffer (10 mM DTT) is extremely low. Therefore, for the DNMT re-ChIP, we developed a
new protocol using immunogen peptide to elute the chromatin complex. We note that this
re-ChIP protocol is not sensitive enough to detect all DNMT–NuRD complexes sitting on
their target promoters as the elution efficiency of antigen peptide competition is only about
10% compared with the standard SDS elution buffer (data not shown). Even so, we are able
to detect the existence of the DNMT1–NuRD complex on the TIMP3 promoter and the
existence of the DNMT3B–NuRD complex on the SFRP4 promoter, as shown in Figures 4c
and d. Given the fact that the sensitivity of this re-ChIP assay is low and the amount of reChIPed DNA is generally extremely low, we cannot rule out the possibility that DNMT–
NuRD complexes also associate with other TSGs. Taken together, our data not only
demonstrate that DNMTs and NuRD physically interact and occupy promoters of TSGs to
maintain stable gene silencing, but also support the idea that these two DNMT–NuRD
complexes possibly have different specificities in the epigenetic silencing of TSGs.

Cooperation of DNMTs and NuRD maintains the silencing of genes encoding for WNT
antagonists

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we set out to identify genes that are epigenetically silenced by the cooperation
between NuRD and DNMTs by analyzing the transcriptomes of cells depleted for CHD4 or
HDAC1 and treated with DAC. Using RNA-seq, we found a population of silenced
transcripts including SFRP1 and 2, TIMP2 and 3 that were reactivated by DNMT inhibition
and knockdown of HDAC1 or CHD4 (Figures 5a–d). We used the reactivation dynamics of
these positive control TSGs as cutoff criteria and found that knockdown of HDAC1
enhanced 407 transcripts in DAC-induced reactivation and knockdown of CHD4 enhanced
1674 transcripts in DAC-induced reactivation (Supplementary Dataset S1A and B).
Importantly, 40% of genes reactivated by both HDAC1 siRNAs and DAC treatment were
also reactivated by both CHD4 siRNAs and DAC, suggesting that NuRD and DNMTs
cooperate to maintain the silencing of these genes (Supplementary Dataset S1C). Using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we found that genes reactivated by DAC treatment and CHD4
or HDAC1 depletion are strongly linked to development, in agreement with NuRD being a
key determinant in cellular differentiation and development (Table 2).12 In addition, these
target genes were linked to genetic disorders, gastrointestinal disease and cancer with the
WNT/β-catenin pathway being significantly enriched among the HDAC1 target genes
(Table 2). Indeed, in both data sets, we found, besides the SFRPs, many other WNT
inhibitors, including WNT inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), Dickkopf 1 and 3 (DKK1 and 3),
VANG-like 2 (VANGL2) and SRY-box 9 and 17 (SOX 9 and 17), which are all commonly
silenced by promoter hypermethylation in CRC33-35 (Supplementary Dataset S1). We tested
a few of these genes (DKK1, DKK3 and VANGL2) by QRT-PCR and confirmed their
reactivation in CHD4 or HDAC1 knockdown cells simultaneously treated with DAC
(Figures 5e and f). Collectively, these data suggest that DNMTs and NuRD cooperate to
maintain silencing of several hundred of genes including multiple negative regulators of the
WNT pathway.
Knockdown of the NuRD components CHD4 and HDAC1 in combination with DNMT
inhibition leads to synthetic sickness, in correlation with reactivation of TSGs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Two genes have a synthetic sickness interaction if their combined inactivation leads to a
lower than expected fitness.36 It is known that tumor cells can tolerate the incomplete
depletion of DNMT1 protein by DAC and that overexpression of SFRPs leads to
apoptosis.22 Given that NuRD and DNMTs cooperate to target many WNT pathway
inhibitors, we tested whether knockdown of the NuRD catalytic subunit CHD4 could
sensitize cells to DAC treatment. To test this, CHD4 knockdown RKO cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of DAC and incubated with a pro-fluorescent peptide,
containing a caspase 3 and 7 DEVD recognition motif, which releases a DNA dye upon
cleavage by caspases 3 and 7, resulting in green fluorescent staining of nuclear DNA. Cells
were followed for 6 days with time-lapse imaging and TSG reactivation was analyzed in
parallel. Depletion of CHD4 strongly potentiated DAC-induced cell death, in association
with reactivation of five TSGs (Figure 6). We found similar results in CHD4-depleted and
DAC-treated RKO and HCT116 cells in long-term proliferation assays. RKO cells with
CHD4 knockdown proliferated slower, even in the absence of DAC treatment, and

sensitized cells to DAC treatment, with induced reactivation of four TSGs (Supplementary
Figures S6A–C). In HCT116 cells, CHD4 depletion only marginally affected cell growth in
the absence of DAC but synergistically inhibited proliferation when combined with DAC, in
association with TSG reactivation (Supplementary Figures S6D–F). Collectively, these
findings demonstrate that depletion of the NuRD component CHD4 sensitizes CRC cells to
DAC treatment and that this occurs temporally with reactivation of silenced TSGs.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is well known that the combined treatment of DNMTi and HDACi in cancer cells
reactivates completely silenced TSGs more effectively than each of these drugs
alone.20,21,37 One potential complication in the use of HDACi and DNMTi in cancer therapy
is their limited target selectivity and off-target effects.38,39 As such, effective epigenetic
therapy with these agents may benefit from identifying the relevant drug targets within these
larger enzyme families to allow the development of more selective inhibitors. Through a
genetic screen, we discovered that HDAC1/2 are the major TSA-sensitive HDACs, which
cooperate with DNMTs to maintain the epigenetic silencing of multiple TSGs in colon
cancer cells. We also find an inverse relationship between HDAC1 and to lesser extent
HDAC2 mRNA levels and expression of two key TSG families in colorectal tumors. These
data have potential clinical relevance as they provide evidence for HDAC1/2 as the relevant
drug targets within the larger HDAC family. Our data thus make the case for the
development of selective HDAC1/2 inhibitors, which may be useful in colon cancer
treatment when combined with DNMTi.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

How does HDAC1/2 cooperate with DNMTs/DNA methylation to maintain TSG silencing?
To answer this question, we took both genetic and biochemical approaches specifically
looking for HDAC1/2 containing complexes that are necessary for the maintenance of TSG
silencing. Interestingly, both approaches identified the same target, the NuRD complex
which is a known reader for methylated DNA. Our finding that NuRD can interact with not
only methylated DNA but also DNMT proteins expands our understanding of the
cooperation between NuRD and the DNA methylation machinery. In line with this, we
demonstrate that DNMTs and NuRD not only physically co-occupy the promoters of a
subset of TSGs but also functionally cooperate to maintain their silencing, suggesting that
DNA hypermethylation works in conjunction with nucleosome remodeling and histone
deacetylation to orchestrate epigenetic gene silencing. Interestingly, our genetic interaction
experiment in HCT116 DNMT mutant cell lines showed that depletion of one DNMT or
CHD4 is not sufficient to reactivate TSGs such as TIMP3 and SFRP2/4, which can be
reactivated only when both CHD4 and DNMTs are depleted. This result suggested that
DNMTs and NuRD can cooperate in both a complex-dependent model and a complexindependent model.
Previously, inhibition of the NuRD complex alone has been suggested as an option for
cancer treatment.12 Deficiency of Mbd2 suppressed intestinal tumorigenesis in a mouse
model of colon cancer.40 Interestingly, a follow-up study proposed that Mbd2 loss may lead
to attenuation of Wnt signaling by upregulation of a Wnt antagonist, Lect241 which is in
support of our finding that multiple WNT inhibitor genes are silenced by the cooperation

between NuRD and DNMTs. Furthermore, we show that depletion of the NuRD complex
subunit CHD4 leads to synthetic sickness when combined with DAC treatment. Thus, one
potential mechanism for the observed synthetic sickness interaction between DNMT and
NuRD inhibition might be inhibition of the WNT pathway by the activation of WNT
inhibitor genes, leading to cell death. This is supported by our previous findings that in
colon cancer cells with hypermethylated SFRPs, restoration of SFRPs attenuates WNT
signaling and induces cell apoptosis.22 It must be noted, however, that at present, we cannot
exclude alternative mechanisms for the synthetic sickness lethality. For example, DNMTs
and NuRD have been shown to be involved in the DNA damage response, G1/S cell-cycle
transition and assembly of heterochromatin formation, which can also affect cell viability
when inhibited.42-45 As such, our study identifies combined inhibition of DNMTs and the
NuRD complex as a potential novel therapeutic strategy. We note that CHD4 has ATPase
activity, which is required for nucleosome sliding and remodeling. As inhibitors of specific
ATPases have been successfully developed, CHD4 is a potentially drug-able target for
cancer therapy.46 Moreover, corresponding to enhanced tumor cell death, our synthetic
sickness lethality experiments suggest that combined inhibition of all these epigenetic
mechanisms induces more efficient reactivation of TSGs than inhibition of each of these
mechanisms alone.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While our studies have uncovered important new roles for components of the NURD
complex in cancer-specific gene silencing with promoter DNA hypermethylation, many
important future extensions of the work are needed. First, our work suggested that increased
expression level of HDAC1/2 has a negative correlation with the expression of TSGs
suppressed by the NuRD complex. As both HDAC1 and HDAC2 are also components of
other repressor complexes, it would be interesting to examine the expression level of
multiple NuRD-specific subunits such as CHD4 in human CRC and whether HDAC1/2 can
mediate TSG silencing in the context of other complexes. Second, HDAC1 and HDAC2 can
be redundant for some biological processes but they can also have specific roles in other
contexts. Although our results suggest that HDAC1 seems to have a more dominant role
than HDAC2 in the silencing of five TSGs, we cannot rule out that HDAC2 may also have
an important role in the maintenance of TSG silencing. Future investigation of genes
specifically silenced by HDAC1 or HDAC2 would provide valuable information for the
application of more specific HDAC inhibitors in cancer therapy.

Germany) or TC10 Cell Counter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). In all, 2.0 × 105 of RKO
cells or 0.75 × 105 HCT116 cells were plated in 6-well dishes. In the case of cell depletion,
all cells remaining were re-plated.
Time-lapse imaging and apoptosis assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RKO cells (1500 per well) were reverse transfected in 384-well plates. DAC (15–1000 nM)
and 1:1000 CellPlayer 5 mM NucView Caspase-3/7 Apoptosis reagent (Essen BioScience,
Ann Arbor, MI, USA) were added every subsequent day when medium was refreshed. Four
wells per condition were imaged (phase-contrast and fluorescence) with a 4-h interval for 6
days using the IncuCyte FLR (Essen BioScience). Apoptosis was quantified by dividing the
confluence of fluorescent apoptotic cells by total confluence as determined by the IncuCyte
software (build 2011A rev2, Essen BioScience).
siRNA transfections

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5 × 105/well RKO or 2 × 105/well HCT 116 cells were reverse transfected with 50 nM
siRNAs (Dharmacon/Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in 6-well format with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For TSG
reactivation assays, transfected cells were split at day 3 and either untreated or treated with
100 nM DAC (HCT116) or 1 μM DAC (RKO) for 2 days. For reconstitution experiments with
siRNAs targeting HDAC1 and CHD4, transfected RKO cells were washed next day with
MEM containing 1 μM DAC. Cells were split in MEM with 1 μM DAC at day 3, transduced
on 2 consecutive days with pQXCIP vectors overexpressing GFP, wild-type or Y303F
mutant Hdac1 and stringently selected with 4 μg puromycin o/n. Cells were processed at day
5 or 6 for TSG expression analysis.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and converted to cDNA using Superscript II
(Invitrogen). QRT-PCRs were run on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master mix
(Roche, Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). mRNA levels were normalized by using at
least two housekeeping genes: GAPDH, PGK, RPL4 or ACTIN. QRT values measured
above cycle 35 were considered as 0. For RKO cells, the data were Log10 transformed and
standardized using the lowest Ct value measured. Primer Sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table S2.

RNA-seq

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNA was extracted with TRIzol and processed using the TruSeq protocol (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA) on an Ilumina Hiseq2000 according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA-seq
reads (18 × 107 to 27 × 107 50bps single-end reads per sample) were mapped to the human
reference genome (build 37) using TopHat (v.1.3.0, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
MD, USA / University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA).48 HTSeq-count (v.
0.5.3p3, EMBL Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to generate a list of total
number of uniquely mapped reads (12 to 18 × 107 pairs of reads per sample) for each gene
present in the Gene Transfer Format (GTF) file (Ensembl release 64). Sequence counts were
normalized for sequence efficiency and 1 was added to all values to avoid negative values
after Log2 transformation.
ChIP experiments
ChIP protocol was described previously49 and the details are provided in Supplementary
materials. The ChIP primer sequences are in Supplementary Table S2.
Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation were described previously.49 Antibody
information and conditions are provided in Supplementary Table S3.
Endogenous DNMT1 immunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometry analysis
Endogenous DNMT1 was immunoprecipitated as described previously.49 The gel was
stained with SimplyBlue (Invitrogen). In-gel digestion of protein bands, mass spectrometry
analysis of peptides, and protein identification were performed as described earlier50,51
except trypsin was used for digestion and a human IPI proteome database was used for
protein identification.
Statistical analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The relationship between HDAC1 and 2 expression levels and indicated TSGs was
determined in gene expression data sets of previously published 396 primary colorectal
tumor samples.25 Expression levels are indicated as Log2 ratios against a colon cancer
reference pool. Expression levels of indicated TSGs were correlated (Pearson correlation)
with levels of HDAC1 and 2.

reads of RKO cells transfected with HDAC1#1 (a) or HDAC1#2 siRNA (b) and treated with DAC in comparison with untreated
scrambled (CONT2) siRNA-transfected cells from a single experiment. The stripes are caused by the addition of 1 to all values
to avoid negative Log2 values. Genes synergistically reactivated by HDAC1 KD and DAC treatment were selected by these
criteria: (1) transcripts that could only be reactivated by both HDAC1#1 and HDAC1#2 siRNA and DAC treatment but not by
scrambled siRNA and DAC treatment and (2) transcripts that were >2-fold induced by scrambled siRNA and DAC treatment
and >2-fold further enhanced by both HDAC1#1 and HDAC1#2 siRNAs. Transcripts enhanced in reactivation by HDAC1

DAC and knockdown of CHD4 synergize in cell death induction, in correlation with reactivation of TSGs. (a) CHD4 siRNAs
induce depletion of CHD4. RKO cells were transduced with scrambled (CONT1-2) or CHD4 siRNAs. CHD4 knockdown was
verified by examining CHD4 protein levels, α-tubulin serves as a loading control. (b) Knockdown of CHD4 sensitizes RKO
cells to DAC treatment. RKO cells from (a) were untreated or treated with indicated concentrations of DAC. Kinetic measures
of the number of caspase-3/7-positive cells, recorded over time and plotted as fluorescent objects, divided by confluence are
shown. n = 3 wells per data point shown, error bars denote s.d. (c, d) Knockdown of CHD4 induces synthetic sickness lethality
with DNMTi in association with TSG reactivation. RKO cells from (a, b) were untreated or treated with 250 nM DAC and
analyzed for caspase 3 and 7 activation by time-lapse microscopy after 140 h (c) and analyzed for TSG reactivation by QRTPCR (d). Error bars denote s.d.
