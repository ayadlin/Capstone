ABSTRACT
Maspin suppresses tumor progression by promoting cell adhesion and apoptosis
and by inhibiting cell motility. However, its role in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The gene regulation of maspin and its relationship
with HCC patient prognosis were investigated in this study. Maspin expression
was specifically reduced in HBV-associated patients and correlated with their poor
prognosis. Maspin downregulation in HCC cells was induced by HBx to promote their
motility and resistance to anoikis and chemotherapy. HBx-dependent induction
of microRNA-7, -107, and -21 was further demonstrated to directly target maspin
mRNA, leading to its protein downregulation. Higher expressions of these microRNAs
also correlated with maspin downregulation in HBV-associated patients, and were
associated with their poor overall survival. These data not only provided new insights
into the molecular mechanisms of maspin deficiency by HBx, but also indicated that
downregulation of maspin by microRNAs confers HBx-mediated aggressiveness and
chemoresistance in HCC.

INTRODUCTION

remain poorly understood. Our previous study showed an
abolishment of maspin expression in HBx-overexpressing
HCC cell lines [23]. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether
and how HBV or HCV infection contributes to HCC
progression through regulating maspin expression.
In this study, we revealed that downregulation of
maspin was specifically observed in HBV-associated HCC
patients and correlated with their poor prognosis. HBx is
the critical regulator for suppressing maspin expression
to enhance the motility and chemoresistance of HCC
cells. Our data further explored that HBx induces gene
expressions of microRNA-7, -21, and -107 to target the
3′-untranslational region (3′-UTR) of maspin mRNA.
These results provide new insights into the molecular
mechanisms of maspin deficiency in response to HBx,
and suggest a positive maspin expression and low maspintargeting microRNAs serving as biomarkers for better
prognosis of HBV-associated HCC patients.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a complex and
heterogeneous disease implicated by diverse risk factors,
shows high invasion/metastasis and postsurgical recurrence,
and low response rate to chemotherapy, leading to its
poor prognosis and low survival [1, 2]. Many risk factors
account for HCC, including aflatoxin, cirrhosis and
hepatitis, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis
C virus (HCV) infections, alcoholic liver diseases, and
nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases [3]. Approximately 75%
of all HCC cases are due to chronic infection with HBV
or HCV viruses [4]. Chronic inflammation resulted from
these viral infections disrupts the balance of damage versus
regeneration in the liver, predisposing to liver cancer through
fibrosis and cirrhosis stages [5]. Viral eradication of HBV
and HCV has been found to efficiently reduce the risk of
HCC development [6], supporting their causal role in HCC
tumorigenesis. However, current curative treatment options
for HCC patients are limited, and a better understanding of
molecular mechanisms underlying the virus-related HCC
development is important for the development of novel
therapeutic approaches.
Both HBV and HCV display a strong hepatotropism,
but they belong to two different viral families. HBV
belongs to the family of hepadnaviridae, and contains a
partially double stranded genomic DNA. The carcinogenic
activities of HBV include insertional activation of cellular
oncogene, induction of genetic instability, and modulation
of host immune response [7]. HBV X protein (HBx), the
smallest one of four overlapping open reading frames of
HBV genome, plays pivotal roles in the tumorigenesis
of HBV-associated HCC via regulating cell cycle
progression, DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, signal
transduction, apoptosis, and cellular adhesion [8–11].
HCV belongs to the family of flaviviridae, and is a single
stranded RNA virus. HCV predisposes to HCC by altering
cell signaling and metabolism as well as by modulating
immune responses [12]. Although both chronic HBV and
HCV infections are major causes of cirrhosis and HCC
tumorigenesis [13], different gene expression profiles
in the liver lesions of chronic hepatitis suggested that
distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms may be responsible
for the hepatocarcinogenesis between HBV and HCV
infections [14, 15].
Mammary serine protease inhibitor (Maspin, also
named serpin B5) which is a member belonging to the
serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily [16] has been
shown to reduce tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis
[17–19]. It increases cellular adherence to fibronectin via
inducing integrin expressions, leading to a reduction of
invasion [20]. Epigenetic loss of maspin expression was
observed in the advanced and chemo-refractory cancers
[21, 22], supporting the anti-metastatic and pro-apoptotic
properties of maspin against tumor progression and
chemoresistance. However, the roles of maspin in HCC

RESULTS
Downregulation of maspin by HBx correlates
inversely with disease-free survival of HBVassociated HCC patients
The clinical relevance of maspin expression in
HCC patients was first assessed. In comparison to their
adjacent normal tissues, 69 of 88 HBV-associated HCC
tumors (78.4%) express lower maspin mRNA level
(Figure 1A) and 24 of 32 cases (75.0%) showed lower
maspin protein level (Supplemental Figure S1A). The
ratio of maspin mRNA and protein expression in these
tumors to their adjacent normal tissue is 0.725 and 0.79,
respectively. However, that was not significantly lower
in HCV-associated or non-HBV and non-HCV (NBNC)associated HCC patients (Figure 1A). The maspin
expression in non-HCC liver tissue was not significantly
different among groups (Supplemental Figure S1B).
Importantly, disease-free survival of HBV-associated HCC
patients was inversely associated with maspin expression
(Figure 1B), suggesting the contribution of maspin
suppression to HBV-induced HCC tumor progression.
Furthermore, HBV-associated HCC patients with lower
maspin expression showed a poor overall survival rate in a
clear tendency to significance ( p = 0.0602) (Supplemental
Figure S1C). The borderline significant trend is probably
due to the reason that different treatments were given
when HCC tumors were recurrent.
To determine the role of HBV in maspin
expression, the protein and mRNA levels of maspin were
examined in the stable HBV genome-transfected HepG2
(HepG2.2.15) cells, and loss of maspin protein and very
low level of maspin mRNA were observed (Figure 1C).
Silencing of HBx by siRNA restored the protein (left
panel) and mRNA level (right panel) of maspin in
HepG2.2.15 cells (Figure 1D). Consistently, transient

HBx-mediated suppression of maspin
contributes to metastasis, anoikis resistance, and
chemoresistance

transfection of Hep3B cells with HBV genome (HBV
WT) also reduced maspin protein level, and this effect
was abolished by HBx deletion (HBV/HBx*; Figure 1E).
To further confirm the downregulation of maspin by
HBx, HBx-overexpressing stable clones were utilized
to examine its protein and mRNA levels. Maspin was
diminished in HBx-overexpressing Hep3B (Hep3Bx)
and HepG2 (HepG2x) cells (Figure 1F) as well as in
HBx-transfected Hep3B cells (Figure 1G). Western
blot analysis further showed an inverse correlation
between HBx and maspin expression in a clear tendency
to significance in HBV-associated HCC tumor tissues
(Supplemental Figure S1D). These data indicated that
HBx can downregulate maspin gene expression.

To examine whether HBx-induced maspin
suppression plays a role in migratory capability,
transwell cell migration assays were carried out in HBxoverexpressing Hep3Bx, HepG2x, and HepG2.2.15
cells and increased cell motility was observed
(Figure 2A). Silence of maspin in Hep3B cells enhanced
(Figure 2B, left) but lenti-viral maspin expression in
Hep3Bx cells reduced (Figure 2B, right) the cell migration,
supporting that HBx increased cell migration through
suppression of maspin. In addition, the enhancement of

by transwell migration assay (n = 3). C and D. HepG2, HepG2.2.15, Hep3B, Hep3Bx, and maspin-expressing Hep3Bx, HepG2, and
HepG2.2.15 cells were cultured on Ultra-low attachment plates followed by cell number counting assays (n > 4). E and F. Hep3B, Hep3Bx,
HepG2, HepG2x, maspin-modulated Hep3B, HepG2 cells, and Hep3Bx cells were treated with indicated concentrations or 1 μg/ml of
doxorubicin for 24 hours and then were subjected to MTT assay (n > 3). The difference was calculated by a Student’s t-test (*p < 0.05;
**p < 0.01)

invasive ability by HBx was also observed in HBx or HBV
genome-transfected HCC cells (Supplemental Figure S2A
and S2B). Conversely, silence of HBx reduced the invasion
ability of HepG2x cells (Supplemental Figure S2C).
These results indicated that HBx also possesses the proinvasion activity in HCC cells. Furthermore, the invasion
ability was enhanced by the silence of maspin expression
by siRNA, and suppressed by maspin overexpression
(Supplemental Figure S2D and S2E). These findings
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

indicated the involvement of maspin suppression in
HBx-induced invasion of HCC cells.
During the process of metastasis, cancer cells
detaching from extracellular matrix (ECM) evade the
anoikis-induced cell death to acquire the ability to survive
in circulation [25]. Therefore, the role of HBx in this event
was also examined. In ultra-low attached anoikis plates,
HepG2.2.15 cells bearing HBV genome showed higher
viability compared to their parental cells (Figure 2C).
25965

Similarly, Hep3Bx cells and transiently HBx-transfected
Hep3B and HepG2 cells were also more resistant to the
anoikis-induced cell death (Figure 2C and Supplemental
Figure S2F). After silencing maspin expression by shRNA
or siRNA, Hep3B cells were rescued from anoikis-induced
cell death (Supplemental Figures S2G). In contrast, lentiviral overexpression of maspin increased the sensitivity of
HBx-expressing HCC cells to anoikis (Figure 2D). These
results support that maspin downregulation conferred
HBx-mediated anoikis resistance in HCC cells.
Both HBx expression and anoikis resistance were
observed to confer cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy
[25–27]. The findings that Hep3Bx and HepG2x cells
were more resistant to all tested chemotherapeutic agents
including doxorubicin (Figure 2E), fluorouracil (5-FU),
methotrexate (MTX), and paclitaxel (Supplemental
Figure S3A) support the role of maspin suppression in
HBx-mediated chemoresistance in HCC cells. Hep3Bx
cells also showed more resistant to doxorubicin as
evidenced by reduction of protein cleavages of poly ADPribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 (Supplemental
Figure S3B). Furthermore, silence of maspin by shRNA
increased HCC resistance to doxorubicin (Figure 2F,
left and middle) and other chemotherapeutic agents
(Supplemental Figure S3C). Silence of maspin in Hep3B
cells also reduced the doxorubicin-induced sub-G1
population (Supplemental Figure S3D). Conversely,
overexpression of maspin can sensitize Hep3Bx cells to
doxorubicin (Figure 2F, right). These results indicated that
the downregulation of maspin is crucial for HBx-induced
migration, anoikis resistance, and chemoresistance.

The stable HBx-expressing Hep3Bx and HepG2x cells and
stable HBV-transfected HepG2.2.15 cells (Figures 4A-4C)
indeed expressed higher levels of miR-7, miR-103,
miR-107, and miR-21. Consistently, liver tumor of HBxtransgenic mice also express lower level of maspin protein
and mRNA (Figures 4D) but higher level of these miRNAs
(Figure 4E) However, the transient HBx-transfection only
induced miR-7, miR-103, and miR107 but not miR-21 in
Hep3B cells (Figure 4F and data not shown), implying that
HBx may immediately induce the expressions of miR-7,
miR-103, and miR-107 but increase miR-21 expression
after long-term expression in Hep3Bx cells.
To further support the role of these miRNAs in
dowrengulating maspin, mimics of miRNA-7, -103, -107,
and -21 were utilized and were observed to remarkably
reduce the protein and mRNA expressions of maspin
(Figure 5A) as well as the luciferase activity of mapsin3′UTR (Figure 5B). The putative binding sequences
on maspin 3′UTR were mutated to identify the target
sites of these microRNAs as illustrated in Figure 3D.
As predicted, specific mutations of individual miRNA
targeting sequences prevent the inhibition on maspin
3′UTR activity (Figures 5B). Argonaute (Ago) proteins are
the catalytic components of the RNA-induced silencing
complex (RISC) responsible for miRNA-mediated gene
silencing [30]. The maspin mRNA detected in anti-Ago2
immunoprecipitates was higher in Hep3Bx cells than in
Hep3B cells, and the Ago2-associated miR-7, miR-103,
miR-107, and miR-21 were also increased in response
to HBx overexpression (Figure 5C). The antisense
oligonuecleotide against miR103, miR7, and miR21
reduced the Ago2-associated maspin mRNA in Hep3Bx
cells (Figure 5D), supporting the direct targeting of maspin
3′-UTR by these microRNAs. Importantly, the inversed
correlation of maspin expression with miR-7, miR-107,
and miR-21 levels reached statistical significance and
also showed clear tendency to significance with miR-103
level (Figure 6A). In comparison to non-tumor parts, the
expressions of these microRNAs were higher in HBVassociated but not in HCV-associated or non-HBV/HCV
HCC tumors, and the increase in miR-21 expression
reached the statistical significance (Figure 6B and
Supplemental Figure S4, respectively). The expression of
miR-21 was also significantly higher in HBV-associated
HCC tumors than in HCV-associated or non-HBV/HCV
HCC tumors (Supplemental Figure S5), suggesting that
these microRNAs mediate maspin suppression and miR21 is the most critical regulator in HBV-associated HCC
tumors. Moreover, the higher levels of miR-7, -107, and
-21 were significantly associated with a poor diseasefree survival of HBV-associated patients. However, the
association of higher expression of miR-103 with the
survival rate only showed a clear tendency to significance
(p = 0.059 in Kaplan-Meier survival test and p = 0.06
in Cox proportional hazards model analysis) (Figure 6C
and Supplemental Table S3). These data suggested that

HBx induces microRNA-7, -103, -107, and -21 to
suppress maspin expression
Although DNA hypermethylation has been
reported to lead to maspin silence in breast cancer cells
[28], transient transfection of HBx slightly reduced the
maspin promoter activity (Figure 3A) but obviously
inhibited the maspin 3′-UTR activity (Figure 3B). These
findings suggested that HBx might downregulate maspin
mRNA level through affecting its stability. Therefore, the
involvement of miRNAs in maspin downregulation in
response to HBx was examined by microRNA microarray
analysis. There are 22 microRNAs elevated at least
2-fold in both Hep3Bx and HepG2x cells (Figure 3C and
Supplemental Table S1). Among them, miR-103, -107,
and -21 targeting maspin 3′UTR sequence were predicted
by 3 target prediction algorithms (miRanda, Targetscan,
and PITA) (Figure 3C and Supplemental Table S2). In
addition, miR-7, which was observed to mediate HBxdependent EGFR attenuation in our previous study [29],
was also predicted as a maspin-targeting microRNA.
Therefore, miR-7, miR-103, miR-107, and miR-21 were
further investigated. The putative targeting sites of these
microRNAs on maspin 3′UTR are illustrated in Figure 3D.

HBx-induced miR-7, miR-107, and miR-21 suppress
maspin expression by directly targeting its mRNA 3′UTR
and thereby confer the poor prognosis in HBV-associated
HCC patients.

HCC cell lines compared with normal hepatocytes has
been reported [32], the role of maspin in HCC tumor
progression remains unclear. In this study, our data showed
that lower expression of maspin is associated with poor
prognosis of HBV-associated HCC patients, suggesting
that maspin is a favorable prognostic biomarker for such
patients. We further demonstrated that HBx-mediated
maspin downregulation contributed to tumor metastasis,
anoikis resistance, and chemoresistance in HCC cells.
Although HBV and HCV infections are both major

causes of HCC, the distinct expression patterns suggest
the different molecular mechanisms in HCC development
[14, 15]. Maspin downregulation was mainly observed in
HBV-associated but not in HCV- or non-HBV/non-HCVassociated HCC patients (Figure 1A), and transfection of
HBV genome but not its HBx-deletion mutant suppressed
maspin expression (Figure 1E), implying the involvement
maspin suppression specifically in HBx-mediated HCC
tumorigenesis.
Although loss of maspin expression was also
frequently occurred in advanced and chemo-refractory
cancers [22, 28, 33], doxorubicin resistance led by
overexpression of maspin via inducing collagen-enriched
microenvironment was observed in breast and ovarian
cancer cells [34], revealing the opposing functions of
maspin in different cancer types. Our data showed that the
HBx-mediated maspin downregulation not only increases
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the migration and invasion abilities but also confers anoikis
resistance and chemoresistance of HCC cells. Our data
further showed that expression of claudin-1, a regulator
of tight junction for inducing EMT, and BCRP, an ABC
transporter mediating chemoresistance, were inversely
correlated with maspin expression in HBx- or HBVstable clones of Hep3B or HepG2 cells (Supplemental
Figure S6A). Restoration of maspin suppressed the
expressions of caludin-1 and BCRP (Supplemental
Figure S6B), suggesting that HBx-induced maspin
loss may contribute to migration and chemoresistance
through regulating these membrane proteins. In addition,
expression of maspin reduces metastasis of breast cancer
cells via repressing urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/
urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) complex,
which enhances the cleavage of a number of extracellular
matrix proteins through activating plasminogen [35].

indicated microRNA primers (n > 3). The difference was calculated by a Student’s t-test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01).

HBx-positive HCC cells were frequently observed to
express urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) [36],
suggesting that HBx-induced maspin repression may
promote metastasis through elevation of uPA. HBx protein
has also been indicated to induce the expression of histone
deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in HCC cells [37]. Interestingly,
the inhibition of HDAC1 by maspin has been proposed to
abrogate the epigenetic silence of Bax and p21WAF1/CIP1 gene
expressions [38]. Maspin was also reported to increase the
acetylation of DNA repair protein Ku70, which causes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

its dissociation from Bax and leads to apoptosis [39].
These observations suggest that HBx-induced maspin
suppression might render cancer cells more insensitive to
chemotherapy through inhibition of pro-apoptotic gene
expressions or leasing Bax protein from mitochondria by
Ku70 protein via increasing HDAC1 function. However,
the detailed mechanisms await further investigations.
Aberrant cytosine methylation and chromatin
condensation of maspin promoter have been reported to
cause the transcriptional silence of maspin expression

tissues was determined using the Kaplan–Meier methods (C) (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001)

[21, 28]. However, our study provided further evidences
that HBx reduced maspin expression through microRNAdependent downregulation rather than transcriptional
suppression. Among them, miR-21 showed the most
inhibition efficacy and substitution of its putative binding
site on maspin 3′UTR also showed the most inhibition on the
3′UTR luciferase activity (Figure 5A and 5B). Consistently,
the expression of miR-21 is higher in HBV-associated
HCC tumors even compared with HCV- or NBNC- tumors
patients and revealed the most significant correlation to
maspin expression and disease-free survival rate. These data
suggested that miR-21 showed a higher targeting efficiency
to mediate maspin suppression and might be a more reliable
marker to predict HCC patients’ prognosis.
Nuclear IKKα-mediated histone H3 Ser10
phosphorylation has been proposed to suppress maspin
transcription in prostate cancer cells [22]. Nevertheless,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation is demonstrated to promote
gene transcription by increasing subsequent histone
acetylations [40], suggesting that H3 Ser10 phosphorylation
by nuclear IKKα may also downregulate maspin expression
indirectly through induction of its negative regulators, such
as microRNAs. Our previous study has demonstrated that
HBx induced nuclear IKKα translocation through Aktdependent Thr-23 phosphorylation to promote motility of
hepatocarcinoma cells [23]. Moreover, our unpublished
data further found that overexpression of IKKα can
increase the expressions of microRNA-7, -103, and -107.
These observations imply the critical regulatory role of
nuclear IKKα in HBx-mediated microRNA induction and
maspin suppression. However, the detailed mechanisms
await further investigations.

time from surgery to the first occurrence of either local
or distant recurrence. Disease-specific survival (DSS)
was defined as time from surgery to HCC-related death.
Subjects were censored at the last follow-up appointment
or at death without recurrence. The patient profiles of the
88 HCC patients were shown in Supplemental Table S3.
The patients included 52 (59.1%) males and 36 (40.9%)
females with age range of 42 to 78 years (mean age 59.7
years). The median follow-up time was 28 months (range,
3 to 46.5 months). At the end of the follow-up, thirty-eight
patients (46.6%) had recurrent HCC (median duration until
recurrence, 9 months; range, 2.5–38.6 months), including
local recurrence in 28 patients, metastasis in 6 patients,
and both local recurrence and metastasis in 4 patients. The
1-year disease specific survival rate was 91.4% and 3-year
disease specific survival rate was 65.6%. Informed consent
in writing was obtained from each patient and the study
protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975
Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell
line and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells Hep3B,
Hep3Bx, HepG2, and HepG2x were obtained from
Mien-Chie Hung, Ph.D. (The University of Texas,
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston). The HBxoverexpressed stable clones, Hep3Bx and HepG2x,
were established from Hep3B and HepG2, respectively,
and selected with G418 antibiotic agent. HepG2 and
HepG2.2.15 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were
kindly provided by Wen-Ling Shih, Ph.D. (Department
of Biological Science and Technology, National Pingtung
University of Science and Technology, Taiwan). The
HepG2.2.15 cells was established by transfecting the
HBV genome into HepG2 cells and selecting with G418.
All cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 U/mL penicillin G, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin
sulfate, at 37°C humidified incubator under an atmosphere
of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were daily checked by morphology
and tested to be Mycoplasma free by DAPI staining within
the last 6 months.

Microarray analysis
Microarray procedures were performed as
previously described (Fukuda et al., 2007). Briefly, total
RNAs from Hep3B, Hep3Bx, HepG2, and HepG2x
cells were isolated using the mirVanaTM RNA Isolation
kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
A flashPAGETM fractionator System (Ambion) was used to
enrich miRNA from total RNA. One hundred micrograms
of total RNA was enriched for small RNA species, tailed
with the mirVanaTM miRNA Labeling Kit (Ambion), and
fluorescently labeled through use of the CyDye MonoReactive Dye Pack (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp).
Unincorporated dyes were removed with a second glass
fiber filter-based cleaning procedure. Hybridization was
carried out on DNA oligonucleotide probes from the
mirVanaTM miRNA Bioarray V9.2 (Ambion). Following
hybridization, the miRNA arrays were scanned using a
GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Raw data

Cheng Kung University Hospital in Tainan, Taiwan. The
diagnosis of HBV and HCV-associated HCC subtype
was made on the basis of presence of HBV or HCV
surface antigen. The characteristics of these patients were
described in Supplemental tables S3 and S4. Expressions
of Maspin mRNA (Figure 1A) and microRNAs (Figure 6)
normalized respectively to GAPDH and U48 were
determined in RT-qPCR analysis. Their differences in
various HCC tumor tissues compared to the normal tissues
was determined in the paired two-tailed Student’s t-test
and p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.

of cumulative survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier
survival test. The univariate and multivariate analyses
were used in Cox proportional hazards models. All these
statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Plot 10.0.
A p-value < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.
Other experimental procedures were described in
Supplemental Materials and Methods.

Authors’ contributions

Briefly, cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde
for 15 min and then treated with Glycine for 5 min.
After wash with cold PBS, cells were lysed in 1 ml of
lysis buffer followed by vortex. The lysates were cleared
by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were
assessed by BCA kit (Thermo, Lafayette, CO, USA). For
immunoprecipitation, lysate was incubated with anti-Ago2
antibody-coated Sepharose beads overnight at 4°C. After
wash with cold NT2 buffer and incubation with proteinase
K (10 mg/ml) at 55°C for 30 min, co-immunoprecipitated
RNA was extracted with Tripure isolation reagent, and
then subjected to RT-qPCR.
