Abstract

Author Manuscript

Despite the initial effectiveness of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib against HER2 geneamplified breast cancers, most patients eventually relapse after treatment, implying that tumors
acquire mechanisms of drug resistance. To discover these mechanisms, we generated six lapatinibresistant HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines. In cells that grew in the presence of
lapatinib, HER2 autophosphorylation was undetectable whereas active PI3K-Akt and MAPK were
maintained. To identify networks maintaining these signaling pathways, we profiled the tyrosine
phosphoproteome of sensitive and resistant cells using an immunoaffinity-enriched mass
spectrometry method. We found increased phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFK) and

putative Src substrates in several resistant cell lines. Treatment of these resistant cells with Src
kinase inhibitors partially blocked PI3K-Akt signaling and restored lapatinib sensitivity. Further,
SFK mRNA expression was upregulated in primary HER2+ tumors treated with lapatinib. Finally,
the combination of lapatinib and the Src inhibitor AZD0530 was more effective than lapatinib
alone at inhibiting pAkt and growth of established HER2-positive BT-474 xenografts in athymic
mice. These data suggest that increased Src kinase activity is a mechanism of lapatinib resistance
and support the combination of HER2 antagonists with Src inhibitors early in the treatment of
HER2+ breast cancers in order to prevent or overcome resistance to HER2 inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

HER2 (ErbB2) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that includes the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER1), HER3, and HER4. Dimerization of HER2
with ligand-activated EGFR or HER3 activates signaling for growth, differentiation, and
survival through multiple downstream effectors including the phosphoinositide-3 kinase
(PI3K)-Akt pathway (Yarden and Sliwkowski 2001). Amplification of the HER2 oncogene
occurs in approximately 25% of human breast cancers and confers a poor prognosis but also
renders tumors susceptible to HER2-targeted therapies (Moasser 2007). Lapatinib, a smallmolecule, ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of HER2 (Rusnak et al 2001), is
an effective therapy for patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (Geyer
et al 2006). However, most patients treated with lapatinib eventually relapse after treatment,
suggesting that tumors acquire or intrinsically possess mechanisms for escape from HER2
inhibition.

Author Manuscript

In HER2-overexpressing cells, the major mechanism of PI3K activation is
heterodimerization with kinase-deficient HER3, which when phosphorylated couples to the
p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (Lee-Hoeflich et al 2008, Yakes et al 2002). Treatment of
HER2-overexpressing cells with lapatinib blocks HER3 phosphorylation and uncouples p85
from HER3, thus inhibiting PI3K-Akt (Junttila et al 2009, Ritter et al 2007). Sustained
inhibition of HER2/HER3 output to PI3K-Akt has been proposed to be essential for the
antitumor effect of HER2 inhibitors. Recently, inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation by the
EGFR TKI gefitinib in HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells was shown to be
followed by feedback upregulation of activated HER3 and Akt, thus limiting the inhibitory
effect of gefitinib (Sergina et al 2007). Therapeutic doses of lapatinib are also followed by
feedback upregulation of phosphorylated HER3 in HER2-dependent breast cancer cells that
is only abrogated by pulsed supra-pharmacological doses (Amin et al 2010). Furthermore,
aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway has been associated with resistance to the HER2
inhibitors trastuzumab and lapatinib (Berns et al 2007, Eichhorn et al 2008, Nagata et al
2004, Serra et al 2008, Yakes et al 2002).

Src family kinases are intracellular tyrosine kinases implicated in signal transduction
downstream of multiple signaling networks including the ErbB receptors. Src association
with HER2 has been shown in human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors (BelschesJablonski et al 2001, Sheffield 1998). The interaction is specific for the HER2 kinase
domain (Kim et al 2005, Marcotte et al 2009) and results in enhanced Src kinase activity and
protein stability (Luttrell et al 1994, Tan et al 2005, Vadlamudi et al 2003). Interestingly,
inhibition of a Src-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of PTEN has been suggested as part
of the antitumor mechanism of trastuzumab (Nagata et al 2004). Because of its involvement
in multiple signaling cascades, Src has become an attractive therapeutic target with several
Src inhibitors in clinical development (Finn 2008).

Author Manuscript

We generated lapatinib-resistant derivatives of HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer
cell lines. All these lines exhibit HER2 amplification and sensitivity to lapatinib with
submicromolar IC50s (Konecny et al 2006). Lapatinib-resistant cells exhibited recovery of
PI3K-Akt signaling despite continued inhibition of the HER2 tyrosine kinase. Using a mass
spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic approach in BT474 cells, we found upregulation of
Src family kinase activity in the resistant cells. This upregulation was observed in 3 of 6
lapatinib resistant cell lines. Treatment of these cells with Src inhibitors arrested cell
proliferation, partially blocked PI3K-Akt signaling, and reversed lapatinib resistance in
these cells. Treatment of HER2-positive xenografts with the combination of lapatinib and a
small molecule inhibitor of Src was more effective than either drug alone. Together these
data support Src activation as a mechanism of lapatinib resistance, and suggest the
combination of HER2 and Src inhibition as a rational therapeutic strategy to prevent and/or
overcome lapatinib resistance in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

RESULTS
Lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cell lines show reactivation of PI3K-Akt and MAPK
signaling

Author Manuscript

HER2-amplified breast cancer cells (BT-474, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-361, HCC1954,
SUM190PT, and UACC-893) were made drug-resistant by maintenance in gradually
increasing concentrations of lapatinib (up 2 µM). Parental cells are highly sensitive with
submicromolar IC50 values (Konecny et al 2006), whereas resistant derivatives were
maintained at 1 or 2 µM (Figure 1A; 1 µM: SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-361, UACC-893; 2 µM:
BT-474, HCC1954, SUM190PT). This concentration is readily achieved in the serum of
patients treated with lapatinib (Burris et al 2005). We next investigated activation of HER2
and the downstream PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways in sensitive and resistant cells by
immunoblot. In lapatinib-resistant cells, HER2 Y1248 phosphorylation remained suppressed
to levels comparable to lapatinib-treated parental cells. However, despite pHER2 inhibition
in resistant cells, PI3K-Akt activity, indicated by S473 pAkt, and Erk activity, indicated by
T202/Y204 pErk, were maintained (Figure 1B). The reactivation of these downstream
pathways despite continued HER2 inactivation by lapatinib suggested the engagement of
alternative compensatory signaling networks to mediate drug resistance.
Lapatinib-resistant cells showed levels of HER2 amplification by fluorescence in-situ
hybridization comparable to parental lines (Supplementary Figure 1). Reactivation of PI3KOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 April 06.

Akt signaling appears causal to lapatinib resistance as all resistant derivatives were sensitive
to the PI3K inhibitor BEZ235 (Maira et al 2008) but not to the MEK1/2 inhibitor CI-1040
(Supplementary Figure 2). To identify pathways that could maintain PI3K-Akt signaling, we
used reverse-phase protein microarray analysis (RPPA), an approach analogous to highthroughput dot blotting (Tibes et al 2006). We found upregulation of pS6, p70S6K, pmTor,
and pGSK3α/β, transducers of PI3K-Akt signaling, in the resistant cells despite continued
inhibition of pHER2 (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 3).
Global phosphotyrosine profiling identifies upregulation of Src family kinases in lapatinibresistant cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To identify upregulated signaling pathways in resistant cells, we used shotgun mass
spectrometry (MS) coupled with immunoaffinity enrichment of phosphotyrosine (pTyr)containing peptides. Mass spectra of phosphopeptides were generated from pTyr pulldowns
of tryptic digests of parental ± lapatinib and resistant BT-474 cells. In total, 684 tyrosine
phosphopeptide spectra were identified in all three sets of samples. These spectra
corresponded to 137 phosphopeptides containing 137 unique phosphotyrosine sites. We
focused on pTyr peptides that were more abundant in drug resistant than sensitive cells by
filtering for peptides whose spectral counts from resistant cells comprised more than 33% of
the total spectral counts recovered from all three sets of samples combined, and for spectra
that were obtained more than once from any of the sets of samples. Spectral counting has
been shown to correlate with abundance of a peptide species in shotgun proteomics (Old et
al 2005, Zhang et al 2006). We found 85 spectra (Table 1, Res column) corresponding to 19
peptides encompassing 20 unique pTyr sites in the resistant cells (Table 1, pTyr site
column). These phosphopeptides were mapped to 22 proteins using IDPicker software.
Representative spectra for pY877 HER2, pY426 Yes, and pY222 Yes peptides are shown in
Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 4.
In untreated parental cells, we identified pTyr peptides for several known phosphorylation
sites in HER2, EGFR, HER3, and MAPK1/3 (Table 2, Par/Con column). All of these except
Y877 HER2 were not recovered or recovered at lower frequency from parental cells treated
with lapatinib (Table 2, Par/Lap column), suggesting that Y877 phosphorylation is
independent of HER2 tyrosine kinase catalytic activity. Notably, except for the Y877 HER2
peptide, no spectra for HER2 pTyr peptides were recovered from resistant cells (Table 2,
Res column), suggesting that HER2 remained inactivated in the resistant cells, consistent
with the Y1248 pHER2 immunoblot (Figure 1B).

Author Manuscript

The Src family kinase (SFK) Yes was the protein for which phosphopeptide spectra were
most frequently obtained in resistant cells. Seventeen spectra corresponding to three
phosphopeptides in Yes (Y426, Y222, and Y537) were observed in resistant cells, more than
any other protein (Table 1, rows 2, 7, 15, and Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly,
phosphorylation of Y222 in Yes was found predominantly in drug-resistant cells. The
homologous site Y216 in Src has been shown to be selectively activated by heregulin and
HER2 signaling (Vadlamudi et al 2003). Phosphorylation of Y216 is a potent enhancer of
Src kinase activity and can overcome the inhibitory effects of Y527 phosphorylation

(Roskoski 2005). These analyses suggested that SFK signaling is associated with acquired
resistance to lapatinib.
To identify other signaling pathways associated with escape from lapatinib action, we
applied Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA) to the 22 phosphoproteins identified in the
resistant cells (from Table 1). This approach identifies kinase-substrate interactions by
comparing the distribution of kinase substrates occurring in the 22-protein input list to the
expected distribution of substrates in databases of known kinase-substrate interactions
(Lachmann and Ma'ayan 2009) (amp.pharm.mssm.edu/lib/kea.jsp). KEA ranked the SFKs
Lyn and Src as most significantly associated with the 22 phosphoproteins found more
abundantly in lapatinib-resistant cells in the initial global phosphoproteomic profiles
(p=0.000001, Supplementary Table 2). Notably, four other SFKs, Lck, Fyn, Frk, and Fgr,
were also significantly associated with the substrate input list.

Src family kinase expression and phosphorylation is increased in lapatinib-resistant cells

Author Manuscript

To validate the results of the MS profiling, we analyzed parental, treated, and resistant cell
lysates by immunoblot with site-specific phosphoantibodies. Lapatinib treatment largely
abolished Y877 pHER2 staining when whole-cell lysates were assayed by immunoblot
(Figure 2B). However, after immunoprecipitation with a pTyr antibody, the same ratio of
Y877 pHER2/total HER2 was observed in parental cells treated with lapatinib and in
resistant cells compared to untreated cells (compare lanes 2 and 3 vs. 1 in Figure 2C, top
panels), supporting persistent phosphorylation at this site in cells where the HER2 kinase
has been inactivated. Conversely, phosphorylation at Y1248 in the C-terminus, a marker of
HER2 kinase-dependent receptor autophosphorylation, was present at baseline but was
undetectable in the pTyr pulldowns from lapatinib-treated and drug-resistant cells (Figure
2C, bottom panels). This is consistent with the increase of pY877 HER2 spectral counts
(Table 2) using the more sensitive and selective immunoaffinity coupled MS approach.

Author Manuscript

To validate the increase in SFK activity suggested by the kinase enrichment analysis of
phosphoproteins in the drug-resistant cells, we immunoblotted cell lysates with an antibody
that recognizes Y416 in the activation loop of Src and related SFKs. In three of the
lapatinib-resistant cell lines (BT-474, HCC1954, and UACC893), we found increased levels
of Y416 pSFK (Figure 2B). One cell line (MDA-MB-361) showed a baseline level of SFK
phosphorylation that was modestly increased upon lapatinib treatment, but not further
increased in resistant cells. In SKBR3 cells, SFK phosphorylation was present at baseline
and did not appear to be affected by lapatinib. In BT-474 cells, global MS pTyr profiling
suggested that the upregulated SFK in these cells was Yes (Table 1). However, the most
abundant phosphopeptide isolated was LIEDNEpYTAR, which is conserved among Src,
Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, and Hck. Using quantitative RT-PCR with primers specific for each
kinase, we found that Yes was the predominant SFK in BT-474 and UACC-893 cells while
Lyn was most abundant in HCC1954 resistant cells (Supplementary Figure 5). Yes
expression was confirmed by immunoblot in BT-474 cells with protein level increased in
resistant cells compared to parental cells (Figure 3A). Low levels of Yes were also found in
MDA-MB-361, HCC1954, and UACC-893 cells. Src was more ubiquitously expressed in
most cell lines tested. Lyn expression was noted only in HCC1954 cells. Interestingly, Yes

expression and phosphorylation was increased in resistant vs. parental cells (BT-474 and
UACC893), and this was accompanied by a decrease in mRNA level. However, Lyn showed
an increased in message level as well as protein expression and phosphorlyation
(HCC1954). This highlights the complex regulation of SFK expression and activation that
also includes interaction with substrates, phosphatases, and subcellular localization (Finn
2008, Yeatman 2004).
To link a particular SFK to the Y416 pSFK band identified by immunoblot, siRNA
oligonucleotides for each of the SFKs were transfected into BT-474 and UACC-893
resistant cells and Y416 pSFK assessed by immunoblot. Knockdown of Yes had the more
significant inhibitory effect on Y416 pSrc levels in these cells (Figure 3B), further
suggesting that Yes the active SFK in lapatinib resistant BT-474 and UACC-893 cells.

Expression of SFKs is increased in primary tumors after treatment with lapatinib

Author Manuscript

To determine whether lapatinib treatment affected SFK expression in HER2+ cancers, we
examined primary tumors from patients with newly diagnosed HER2+ breast cancer treated
with lapatinib. Lapatinib was given alone for 6 weeks, before patients were treated with
trastuzumab and chemotherapy for 12 weeks prior to surgery (Figure 3C). During the first 6
weeks of lapatinib therapy, tumor volumes overall were decreased (Migliaccio et al 2009).
Matched pre- and post-lapatinib treatment biopsies with sufficient tumor material were
available from 8 patients for RNA isolation and microarray hybridization to Affymetrix
GeneChips. We compared the intensity of expression for probesets corresponding to Src,
Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, and Hck before and after lapatinib. We found statistically significant
increases in expression of approximately 2-fold (p<0.04) for 7 probesets corresponding to
Lyn, Lck, and Fyn (Figure 3D, Supplementary Table 3). Unfortunately, the Y416 pSrc
antibody in our hands was inadequate for reliable quantitation of immunohistochemistry in
these samples.
Inhibition of SFKs inhibits growth and PI3K-Akt in lapatinib-resistant cells

Author Manuscript

To determine whether SFK inhibition in drug-resistant cells would restore lapatinib
sensitivity, we utilized two small-molecule inhibitors of Src and related kinases: dasatinib
and AZD0530. Dasatinib inhibits Src, Lck, and Yes kinases with IC50 of 0.4–0.5 nM
(Lombardo et al 2004). AZD0530 inhibits Src, Lck, Yes, Lyn, and Fyn kinases with an IC50
of 2.5–10 nM (Green et al 2009, Hennequin et al 2006). Treatment of lapatinib-resistant
cells with either Src inhibitor reduced Y416 pSFK and paxillin phosphorylation (Figure 3E),
a downstream target of SFKs that has been evaluated as a biomarker for Src inhibition
(Jones et al 2009). Interestingly, there was some cell-line specificity to the relative potency
of inhibition of SFKs and downstream targets, with dasatinib being more effective in
HCC1954 cells and AZD0530 more effective in UACC-893 cells. Treatment with the Src
inhibitors abolished Y877 phosphorylation in the resistant cells, and partially inhibited
HER3 phosphorylation. Finally, in four resistant lines, Akt S473 phosphorylation was at
least partially inhibited by one of the Src inhibitors in combination with lapatinib. This result
suggests that SFK activation at least in part maintains PI3K-Akt in lapatinib-resistant cells.

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 April 06.

Rexer et al.

Page 7

Author Manuscript

We also tested whether AZD0530 combined with lapatinib would overcome lapatinib
resistance in 3D Matrigel growth assays. In the three resistant cell lines with increased SFK
activation (BT-474, HCC1954, UACC-893), AZD0530 inhibited 3D acini formation and
restored lapatinib sensitivity (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 6). In the other lapatinibresistant cell lines (MDA-MB-361, SK-BR-3 and SUM190PT) where SFKs were not
hyperactive compared to drug-sensitive parental cells, the addition of AZD0530 did not
enhance lapatinib action. In 2D proliferation assays, Src inhibitors in combination with
lapatinib blocked the growth of primarily the lapatinib-resistant cells that exhibited
increased SFK activity though in this assay there was moderate inhibition of MDA-MB-361
resistant cell growth (Supplementary Figure 7).
Lapatinib and the Src inhibitor AZD0530 synergize against HER2-overexpressing
xenografts

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We found that upregulation of SFK activity was acquired as the cells developed resistance to
lapatinib. Thus, we hypothesized that the addition of a Src inhibitor to lapatinib would
prevent or delay the development of drug resistance and might further suppress tumor
growth compared to lapatinib alone. To test this, mice bearing BT-474 xenografts were
randomized to therapy with vehicle (controls), lapatinib, AZD0530, or the combination of
both drugs for 30 days. Lapatinib inhibited growth of established BT-474 xenografts, while
AZD0530 alone had no activity compared to control mice. Tumors treated with the
combination exhibited a statistical reduction in tumor volume compared to both lapatinib
and control arms starting at 1 week of therapy (Student’s t-test, p<0.05, Figure 5A). The
combination was without significant observed toxicity and the weight of mice in the
combination arm was maintained throughout the experiment (Figure 5B).
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections showed significant inhibition of SFK
phosphorylation by AZD0530, alone or in combination with lapatinib. Activation of Akt in
situ, as evaluated by nuclear staining for S473 pAkt, was markedly reduced by lapatinib
alone or in combination with AZD0530. However, treatment with both lapatinib and
AZD0530 inhibited cytoplasmic pAkt more significantly than lapatinib alone (Figure 5C,
D). Overall, this immunohistochemical analysis suggested that the combination of lapatinib
and AZD0530 more potently inhibited PI3K-Akt in vivo.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

In this study, we generated lapatinib-resistant HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer
cells in order to discover preferential mechanisms of escape from drug-induced inhibition of
the HER2 tyrosine kinase. In all resistant cells, HER2 amplification was present and active
PI3K-Akt and MAPK were maintained yet HER2 C-terminal autophosphorylation was
undetectable. Reactivation of the PI3K-Akt pathway appeared to be causal to lapatinib
resistance, as all resistant lines were exquisitely sensitive to PI3K but not MEK inhibition.
To identify signaling pathways conferring resistance to lapatinib, we profiled the tyrosine
phosphoproteome of resistant cells using an immunoaffinity mass spectrometry approach.
The phosphopeptides identified by spectral counts to be more abundant in resistant cells
were those corresponding to the Src family kinase Yes (Y222 and Y426) and to HER2 (at
the non-autophosphorylation site Y877), suggesting a role for SFKs in mediating resistance.

Author Manuscript

The Y877 phosphorylation site in the activation loop of the HER2 kinase is analogous to
Y426 Yes and Y416 in the activation loop of Src. In other kinases, phosphorylation of this
residue allows the activation loop to assume a catalytically competent confirmation and
increases kinase activity (Hubbard and Till 2000). Some evidence suggests that Y877
phosphorylation increases the kinase activity of HER2, as mutation of Y877 to
phenylalanine in both human HER2 and its rat homolog Neu decreases the kinase’s catalytic
activity and transforming activity (Xu et al 2007, Zhang et al 1998). In contrast, mutation of
the corresponding Y845 in EGFR, also identified as a Src substrate, disrupts EGFR function
but does not decrease the catalytic activity of the kinase (Biscardi et al 1999, Tice et al
1999). Since C-terminal autophosphorylation depends on the catalytic activity of HER2, the
lack of phosphorylation in Y1248 in the C-terminus of HER2 in drug-resistant cells (Figure
2C) suggests that maintenance of Y877 phosphorylation does not overcome lapatinibinduced inhibition of the receptor’s kinase activity. Another possible role for Y877
phosphorylation in enhancing HER2/HER3 heterodimer formation has been proposed
(Ishizawar et al 2007). Maintenance of HER2/HER3 heterodimers would be a mechanism
for partial maintenance of PI3K activity in light of the six p85 binding sites in HER3. This
would support a role for persistent Y877 phosphorylation in engaging the HER3-PI3K-Akt
axis in order to circumvent drug action.

Author Manuscript

We also identified increased phosphorylation of the corresponding activation loop residue of
Yes, Y426, in resistant cells. In addition, we found phosphorylation at Y222 Yes (Y216 Src)
exclusively in lapatinib-resistant cells. Phosphorylation at Y216 Src can significantly
increase the kinase activity of Src and can overcome the inhibitory effects of
phosphorylation at the regulatory Y527 site (Roskoski 2005). Of note, heregulin, a HER3
ligand that activates HER2/HER3 signaling, has been shown to induce phosphorylation of
Y216 in Src in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Further, higher levels of phosphorylation at Y216
correlates with increased HER2 expression in breast tumors (Vadlamudi et al 2003). As with
Y877 HER2, the phosphorylation at Y222 in Yes was limited to lapatinib-resistant cells
where the catalytic activity of HER2 remained inhibited, suggesting that the HER2 kinase is
not involved in phosphorylation of Y216 Yes.

Author Manuscript

The correlation of increased Yes activity indicated by Y222 and Y426 phosphorylation with
persistent Y877 HER2 phosphorylation in resistant cells suggested that Y877 in HER2 is a
Src kinase substrate. This is supported by our observation that Src inhibitors decreased Y877
pHER2 (Figure 3E), and by other observations where treatment with PP1 or PP2 (Ishizawar
et al 2007, Xu et al 2007) or expression of kinase-dead or dominant-negative Src (Marcotte
et al 2009) abrogated phosphorylation at this site. Fyn and Yes can also mediate Y877
HER2 phosphorylation (Xu et al 2007). In contrast, an earlier report found that Y877
phosphorylation was decreased by treatment with PD168393, a HER2 TKI, leading to the
conclusion that Y877 was an autophosphorylation site (Bose et al 2006). While we observed
a similar result in immunoblots of whole cell lysates after lapatinib treatment, these
observations contrast with the level of phosphorylation at this site detected with
immunoaffinity enrichment for pTyr prior to analysis by immunoblot (Figure 2C) or by MS
(Table 2). Using the more sensitive and specific MS-based approach, we found that the
relative level of phosphorylation of Y877 HER2 is not decreased whatsoever by lapatinib.

This implies that HER2 is not the kinase that phosphorylates Y877 HER2, and further
underscores the importance of persistent Y877 phosphorylation in lapatinib-resistant cells.
While Yes was the predominant SFK in two of the cell lines we tested, Lyn was also
overexpressed and phosphorylated in lapatinib-resistant HCC1954 cells. This is in
agreement with the findings of Hochgrafe et al., who employed a phosphoproteomic
approach to identify signaling networks in basal-like breast cancer (Hochgrafe et al 2010).
In their study, they found higher levels of total and phosphorylated Lyn in breast cancer
cells with a basal-like gene expression signature, including HCC1954. They further noted
that combining a Src inhibitor to block Lyn with the inhibitor of EGFR/HER2 AG1478
(Lenferink et al 2001) was more effective than either alone in inhibiting proliferation of
HCC1954 cells. We have extended this previous report and show herein that dasatinib
inhibited the proliferation of lapatinib-resistant HCC1954 cells.

Finally, we showed that the combination of HER2 and SFK inhibitors is more effective than
either agent alone at preventing and/or overcoming escape from lapatinib. There is the
potential to use this combination clinically; recently the combination of lapatinib and
dasatinib was found to be well-tolerated in a phase I trial (Erlichman et al 2009). However,
it will be important to identify predictors of sensitivity to Src inhibition or biomarkers of Src
activation for appropriate patient selection. In this study, we observed increased Src activity
only after the development of resistance to lapatinib and, second, Src inhibitors inhibited cell
growth only in combination with lapatinib. These results should be contrasted from data in
two prior reports (Finn et al 2007, Huang et al 2007), where the three cell lines exhibiting
upregulated SFK activity upon development of resistance to lapatinib in our study were
classified as modestly sensitive or resistant to dasatinib alone. Taken together, these data
imply that biomarkers predictive of sensitivity to Src inhibitors may be different for tumors
prior to vs. after the onset of resistance to HER2 inhibitors. This also implies the need to
rebiopsy tumors at the time of progression following primary anti-HER2 therapy to assess
the status of Src activation. Finally, these results suggest that, at least for HER2+ tumors,
Src antagonists will only be effective as part of combinations with anti-HER2 therapy.

All cells were from the American Type Culture Collection except SUM190PT (Asterand).
The following inhibitors were used at the indicated concentrations: lapatinib ditosylate
(GW-572016, LC Laboratories), 1 µM; BEZ235 (Novartis), 0.25 µM; AZD0530
(AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals), 1 µM; and dasatinib (Bristol-Myers Squibb), 1 µM; CI-1040
(Pfizer), 1 µM.
Cell proliferation and 3D culture assays
Cell proliferation was measured with the WST-1 reagent after drug treatment for the
indicated times. For 3D assays, cells were grown in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) with
inhibitors for 10–14 days.

Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer and quantitated by BCA assay (Pierce). Lysates were
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF-FL (Millipore), and blotted with the
indicated antibodies.
Reverse phase protein lysate microarray (RPPA)
RPPA was performed as described (Tibes et al 2006) using lysates from untreated parental
cells, cells treated with lapatinib for 1 or 24 h, or lapatinib-treated resistant cells. Lysates
were analyzed with the indicated antibodies.
Immunoaffinity mass-spectrometry phosphotyrosine profiling

Author Manuscript

pTyr peptides were enriched from tryptic digests of cell lysates as described (Rush et al
2005) except that lysates were subjected to brief PAGE and in-gel trypsin digestion. LCMS-MS analysis of immunoaffinity-purified peptides was performed as described (Luo et al
2008) with modifications described in Supplementary Methods. MS/MS peptide spectra
were acquired using data-dependent scanning in which one full MS spectrum was followed
by 5 MS/MS spectra. A data-dependent scan for the neutral loss of phosphoric acid or
phosphate resulted in acquisition of an MS/MS/MS of the neutral loss ion. Proteins were
identified from mass spectra using the Myrimatch algorithm and the human IPI database (v.
3.56) (Tabb et al 2007). Data were filtered using a 2% FDR for all peptides using the
IDPicker algorithm (Zhang et al 2007) allowing for a single peptide/spectrum match.
Real-time quantitative PCR

Author Manuscript

RNA isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was converted to cDNA and used as template
for SYBR Green qPCR (SABiosciences). Fold-change in gene expression was calculated
using the ΔΔCt (threshold cycle) method with normalization to levels of actin expression in
each template.
siRNA-mediated SFK knockdown
Lapatinib-resistant cells were transiently transfected with siRNA oligos for Src, Yes, Fyn, or
Lyn (Qiagen) for 72h before lysis and analysis by immunoblot.
Human tumor biopsies and microarray analyses

Author Manuscript

After informed consent, patients with newly diagnosed HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
were enrolled in an IRB-approved trial at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX).
Lapatinib was administered at 1,500 mg/day p.o. for 6 weeks. Core biopsies were obtained
at baseline before treatment and after 42 days of therapy. There were 8 paired samples with
sufficient material for RNA isolation and microarray hybridization. Microarray analysis was
performed as described in Supplementary Methods. Expression levels of probes for Src
family kinases were analyzed with dCHIP and expression levels displayed in a heatmap.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

Author Manuscript

HER2 gene copy number was determined by FISH as described (Ritter et al 2007). HER2
and CEP17 signals were quantified from 50 consecutive cells, and ratios of HER2 to CEP17
for each cell line were calculated.
Studies with xenografts
Animal studies were approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. BT-474 cells were injected into female athymic nude
mice bearing slow-release estrogen pellets (Innovative Research of America) as described
(Wang et al 2006). After tumors reached 250 mm3, treatment was begun with lapatinib (100
mg/kg) and/or AZD0530 (50 mg/kg) daily by oral gavage.

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Tumor sections were analyzed by IHC with the indicated antibodies. Staining was evaluated
by a pathologist blinded to treatment groups (N.M.G-I.) and an H-score was calculated as
described in Supplementary Methods. H-scores and percent of positive nuclear staining were
compared between sections from different treatment groups with the Student’s t-test.
