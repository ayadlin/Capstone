Vascular Endothelial Growth
Factor-targeted Therapy in Metastatic
Renal Cell Carcinoma*
Brian I. Rini, MD

Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene in most sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
tumors leads to a fundamental reliance on elements of this pathway, namely, the potent proangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Thus, VEGF-targeted therapeutics have undergone extensive
clinical testing in RCC. Approaches to bind circulating VEGF protein (eg, bevacizumab) and small molecule
inhibitors of the receptor on which the VEGF ligand binds (eg, sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, and pazopanib)
have been tested. Robust clinical effects have been observed, including high objective response rates, prolonged progression-free survival, and evidence of long overall survival for patients with metastatic RCC
patients who are treated with these agents. Future directions include investigation of combination and
sequenced therapy, elucidation of mechanisms of response and resistance, and exploration of the effect of

A growing understanding of the underlying molecular biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has established the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway as a relevant therapeutic target. The pathogenesis of RCC was elucidated by the discovery of the VHL gene from study of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
syndrome families.1 VHL is a tumor suppressor gene in which 1 allele is inactivated through a deletion
(also known as loss of heterozygosity) observed in >90% of noninherited (sporadic) clear cell RCC.2
The remaining VHL allele is inactivated either through gene mutation (approximately 50% of clear cell
RCC3-5) or through gene silencing by methylation (approximately 5%-10% of cases1,6). This biallelic
gene inactivation promotes a tumor phenotype. VHL encodes the VHL protein, which is a component of
an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets a transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for
ubiquitinization and proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. 1). If VHL is inactivated, then a defective
VHL protein is produced, and HIF is not degraded. The VHL protein also is unable to bind HIF in

VEGF-targeted Therapy in RCC/Rini

FIGURE 1. Normal and aberrant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway in renal cell carcinoma. In conditions of normoxia and normal von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene function, VHL protein is the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex that targets hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) a for proteolysis. In cellular hypoxia or with an inactivated VHL gene,
the VHL protein-HIF interaction is disrupted, leading to stabilization and accumulation of HIF transcription factors. Activated HIF
translocates into the nucleus and leads to transcription of a large repertoire of hypoxia-inducible genes, including VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These ligands bind to their cognate receptors, which are present on the surface of endothelial cells, leading to cell migration, proliferation, and permeability. Sites of action of VEGF-targeted therapies are illustrated.
Bevacizumab is a VEGF ligand-binding antibody. Sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, and pazopanib are small molecule inhibitors of the
VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and PDGF receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases. Pro indicates proline; Ub, ubiquitin; OH, hydroxy group.

conditions of hypoxia, as occurs in RCC and other solid
tumors. Activated HIF then translocates into the nucleus
and leads to the transcription of VEGF and of a variety of
genes that play a central role in tumor progression.7
Sunitinib
Sunitinib (Sutent; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) is a small
molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase portion of the
VEGF family of receptors.8 Initial phase 2 trials of sunitinib given at a dose of 50 mg orally every day for 4 weeks

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0, a time from diagnosis to metastases 1 year, and a
corrected serum calcium level 10 mg/dL.11 Overall survival (OS) data also were reported recently.12 Sunitinibtreated patients had a median OS of 26.4 months versus
21.8 months for interferon-treated patients (P ¼ .051). It
is noteworthy that several patients who were randomized
to receive interferon received sunitinib and other active,
targeted therapy on progression, likely under powering
this trial to detect a difference in OS. Clearly, the very
high median OS numbers compared with historic controls support the finding that targeted therapy has meaningfully extended the lives of patients with metastatic
RCC. On the basis of these data, sunitinib has emerged as
a front-line standard of care in metastatic RCC. This drug
is notable for a superior objective response rate compared
with the other agents balanced against toxic effects,
including fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.13 Cardiac toxicity also has
2308

been described with sunitinib as well as sorafenib. These
events largely comprise declines in ejection fraction/
congestive heart failure as well as cardiac ischemia.14,15
Descriptions of cardiotoxicity have come largely from retrospective, single-institution reviews. Thus, more thorough, prospective investigation of these potentially
relevant toxicities is needed to define appropriate monitoring and intervention and to properly equate the risk/
benefit of these agents.
Sorafenib
Sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer Pharmaceuticals [West Haven,
Conn] and Onyx Pharmaceuticals [Richmond, Calif]) is a
small molecule inhibitor of VEGF and related receptors
and also inhibits an intracellular signaling enzyme, raf
kinase.16 A phase 3 trial of sorafenib randomized 905
patients with treatment-refractory, metastatic RCC to

months versus 2.8 months was observed (P < .000001)
(Table 1).17 The hazard ratio for disease progression in
the sorafenib group was 0.44 (P < .01). The median OS
was 17.8 months for patients in the sorafenib group and
15.2 months for patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.88; P ¼ .146). However, there was a suggestion of
improved survival with sorafenib after the censoring of
placebo patients who crossed over to the sorafenib arm
(17.8 months vs 14.3 months; P ¼ .03) with similar concerns of on-study and off-study crossover, as noted above
with sunitinib.18 These phase 3 data are somewhat in contrast to the results from a smaller, randomized phase 2
study of sorafenib versus interferon in 189 patients with
previously untreated, metastatic RCC. The median PFS
in that trial was 5.7 months with sorafenib versus 5.6
months with interferon.19 Currently, the reason for the
lack of a significant effect compared with interferon in the
front-line setting is not entirely clear but may result from
weaker inhibition of the VEGF receptor compared with
sunitinib.16 Toxic effects with sorafenib generally are the
same type as those with sunitinib but may be somewhat
less in severity. Although, in some patients, sorafenib is a
preferred initial agent because of the toxicity profile or
other considerations, the use of sorafenib has moved
toward second-line and later therapy. Studies are needed
to identify the phenotype of patients in whom sorafenib is
the preferred initial treatment.
Axitinib
Axitinib (AG-013736; Pfizer Inc.) is a substituted imidazole derivative that inhibits the tyrosine kinase portion of
all VEGF receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-b at notably low nanomolar concentrations. Oral, twice daily axitinib dosing results in
significant tumor growth inhibition in several human xenograft and murine models through an antiangiogenic
mechanism. A phase 2 trial of axitinib at a dose of 5 mg
orally twice daily (continuous dosing) was conducted in
52 patients with RCC, all of whom had failed on prior
cytokine therapy.20 In an intention-to-treat analysis, 2
complete responses and 21 partial responses were noted
for an objective response rate of 44.2%, and most patients
displayed some tumor shrinkage. The median response
duration was 23 months, and the median time to progression was 15.7 months. The median time to progression,
Cancer

the objective response rate, and the response duration in
that study compare favorably with available data for other
drugs, although such comparisons are limited given the
investigator-assessed response and separate conduct of the
trials. A hypothesis can be generated that the high picomolar potency of axitinib against VEGF receptors 1, 2,
and 3 accounts for the high level of antitumor activity.
Treatment-related adverse events included diarrhea,
hypertension, proteinuria, fatigue, nausea, and hoarseness. Treatment-related hypertension occurred in 30
patients and resolved with antihypertensive treatment in
all but 8 patients, including 7 patients who had a history
of hypertension at baseline. The notable toxic effects of
hypertension and proteinuria likely reflect potent inhibition of the VEGF receptor.
Patients with sorafenib-refractory RCC were enrolled in a subsequent multicenter, open-label, phase 2
study.21 Axitinib was administered at 5 mg orally twice
daily, with dose escalation up to 10 mg twice daily allowed
if tolerable. Patients in that study were treatment refractory and had received a median of 2 prior therapies (range,
1-8 prior therapies); all patients had received prior sorafenib, and 14 patients also had received prior sunitinib. A
partial response was observed in 13 of 62 evaluable
patients (23%), whereas 55% experienced some degree of
tumor regression. One of 14 patients who received both
prior sorafenib and sunitinib exhibited a partial response.
With a median follow-up of 8.1 months, the overall median PFS was 7.4 months. A phase 3 trial of axitinib versus
sorafenib currently is underway in patients with metastatic
RCC who failed front-line therapy.
Pazopanib
Pazopanib (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park,
NC) is an oral multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3; PDGFR; and c-kit that
has a significant inhibitory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and inhibition of VEGF-induced VEGF receptor-2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs and cornea in a
dose-dependent manner.22 A randomized, discontinuation design, phase 2 study recently was conducted in
patients who had received either no systemic therapy or
1 prior systemic therapy.23 Two hundred twenty-five
patients with metastatic RCC were treated (69% previously untreated patients and 84% patients with good or
2309

intermediate risk). The independently reviewed objective
response rate was 34.7%, and the median PFS was 11.9
months. The PFS in the randomized comparison (n ¼ 55)
was 11.9 months for pazopanib versus 6.2 months for placebo (P ¼ .0128). Toxic effects included those typical of
this class of VEGF receptor inhibitors, including fatigue,
diarrhea, and hypertension, with a notably low incidence
(12% any grade) of hand-foot syndrome. A phase 3 trial versus placebo in patients with RCC who either received no
prior therapy or failed on prior therapy with cytokines or
bevacizumab has completed accrual, and those results are
expected in 2009. In addition, a phase 3 trial versus sunitinib in patients with treatment-naive RCC is underway.
Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San Francisco,
Calif) is a monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes
circulating VEGF protein.24 The activity of this agent in
RCC was identified initially in small randomized trials.18,25 More recently, multicenter international studies
have established bevacizumab-based therapy as robust in
the front-line setting.26,27 A phase 3 trial randomized 649
untreated patients with metastatic RCC to receive treatment either with interferon (Roferon; Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) plus placebo infusion or interferon plus bevacizumab infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.26
A significant advantage was observed for bevacizumab
plus interferon (objective response rate, 31% vs 13%; P <
.0001; PFS, 10.2 months vs 5.4 months; P < .0001) (Table 1). The hazard ratio for progression in the bevacizumab plus interferon arm was 0.63 (P ¼ .0001). A second
multicenter phase 3 trial, which was conducted in the
United States and Canada through the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, was nearly identical in design with the
exception that it lacked a placebo infusion and did not
require prior nephrectomy.27 In that trial, the median
PFS was 8.5 months in patients who received bevacizumab plus interferon versus 5.2 months for patients who
received interferon monotherapy (P < .0001). The hazard
ratio for progression in patients who received bevacizumab plus interferon after adjusting for stratification factors was 0.71 (P < .0001). In addition, among patients
with measurable disease, the objective response rate was
higher in patients who received with bevacizumab plus
interferon (25.5%) than for patients who received inter2310

feron monotherapy (13.1%; P < .0001). The contribution of interferon to the antitumor effect of this regimen
currently is unclear, although preliminary results indicate
a longer PFS and a higher response rate than expected
with bevacizumab monotherapy.25 In addition, a subset
analysis revealed a similar benefit with the combination in
patients who had an interferon dose reduction because of
toxic effects.28 Given the lack of dose response for interferon, it is possible that lower interferon doses in this combination can reduce toxic effects and preserve efficacy.
Such a hypothesis requires prospective testing. Combination interferon and bevacizumab therapy is more toxic
than either agent as monotherapy, notably for fatigue,
anorexia, hypertension, and proteinuria. Thus, the use of
interferon with bevacizumab requires evaluation of the
risk-benefit ratio for each patient. On the basis of these
findings, regulatory approval of bevacizumab plus interferon in patients with advanced RCC has occurred in
Europe and is expected in the United States. Given the
presence of high-level evidence consisting of 2 positive
phase 3 trials of this combination, it is likely that bevacizumab plus interferon will join sunitinib as a front-line
standard of care.
Future Directions
Because VEGF-targeting agents have established themselves as active monotherapies in metastatic RCC, several
questions have emerged. Sequencing of monotherapies
has become the empiric standard, with retrospective and
emerging prospective data supporting this treatment paradigm. Whether a specific sequence is preferred requires
additional testing. In addition, combinations of these
agents to maximize VEGF pathway inhibition and potentially augment the antitumor effect have begun initial
assessment for safety and efficacy. Large trials of high-risk,
resected, localized RCC have begun to delineate the value
of this approach in the adjuvant setting. Further, additional work is needed to identify the clinical and molecular phenotype of response and resistance to this approach
in an effort to more appropriately individualize therapy.
Conclusions
Multiple approaches to block the action of VEGF have
emerged as therapeutically viable strategies in metastatic

RCC. VEGF-targeted agents have revolutionized the
management of this disease and are now the standard of
care. Additional clinical and translational research is
needed now to optimize the use of these agents. The relative risks and benefits to each approach for an individual
patient require further study.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral
presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on
Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not
correspond directly to the written article, which is a more general review.
Discussion after Brian I. Rini’s presentation.
Michael Atkins: With regard to the thyroid problems that happened with sunitinib, it seems to happen in
patients who continue taking the drug for a long period.
Do you think this effect is anything more than just a toxic
effect on the thyroid? Is there any evidence that it might
be immune mediated?
Dr. Rini: I am not aware of any evidence that it is
immune mediated.
Dr. Atkins: So patients on the drug longer are more
likely to develop thyroid dysfunction?
Dr. Rini: I think so.
Robert Figlin: Is it a chemical or clinical effect?
Dr. Rini: First it is biochemical, then clinical.
Marston Linehan: Does this reverse?
Dr. Rini: It reverses with discontinuation of the
drug.
Bernard Escudier: I have patients in complete
remission with sunitinib. I have stopped the drug, and
they remain in complete remission. I know that most of
you would probably continue with the drug, but while
they were in complete remission they had no reason to
continue. The longest duration is 6 months.
Dr. Rini: I think there will be a tail of the curve. To
say there are no complete remissions or no durability is
not known yet.
Ronald Bukowski: There is a tail with interferon,
too.
Dr. Atkins: It is fair to say that those data are based
on patients treated in 1988. A lot more has been done
since then in terms of selecting patients who get therapy.
Cancer

May 15, 2009

In 2000, the response rates to high-dose IL-2 were in the
20% to 25% range, and 10% of people had durable complete remissions. It is possible that there may be ways to
select even further using various markers.
Dr. Rini: More people have not embraced this
because it is such a highly selective procedure applied
to a highly selective population, but IL-2 still has some
role.
Dr. Atkins: What do you think explains the difference in activity between sorafenib and sunitinib? Do you
think it has to do with how effectively they block VEGF
receptor signaling, or are there other targets of these agents
that may be critical in explaining their different response
rates?
Dr. Rini: It could be both. My bias is that it is
potency and selectivity against the VEGF receptor.
Dr. Atkins: It seems like the data with sunitinib,
which has less off-target effect, probably support that.
