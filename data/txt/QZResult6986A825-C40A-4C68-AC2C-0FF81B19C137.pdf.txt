ABSTRACT
Cyclin dependent kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases
that are traditionally activated upon association with a regulatory subunit. For most
CDKs, activation by a cyclin occurs through association and phosphorylation of the
CDK’s T-loop. CDK5 is unusual because it is not typically activated upon binding with
a cyclin and does not require T-loop phosphorylation for activation, even though it
has high amino acid sequence homology with other CDKs. While it was previously
thought that CDK5 only interacted with p35 or p39 and their cleaved counterparts,
Recent evidence suggests that CDK5 can interact with certain cylins, amongst other
proteins, which modulate CDK5 activity levels. This review discusses recent findings
of molecular interactions that regulate CDK5 activity and CDK5 associated pathways
that are implicated in various diseases. Also covered herein is the growing body of
evidence for CDK5 in contributing to the onset and progression of tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION

the missing 32 amino acids are encoded by exon 6 [9].
Although these two groups reported conflicting data, it has
been suggested that the identified isoforms are in fact the
same protein and the variances in their data are due to
different methodologies [10].
CDK5 can be mapped to chromosome 7q36 and its
expression is upregulated by the transcription factors Fos
and CREB through the MEK/ERK pathway and by δFosB
[11, 12]. CDK5 plays a vital role in the central nervous
system but has functions in other cell types. Outside of the
nervous system, active CDK5 has been found in pancreatic
β cells [13], corneal epithelial cells [14] and monocytes
[15] amongst various other cell types [10, 16]. In the
nervous system, CDK5 is involved in neuron migration,
neurite outgrowth and support, and synaptogenesis.
CDK5’s function in cells other than neurons includes
the induction of cell motility, apoptosis, and cell cycle
progression as well as functions involved with the immune
system, lymphatic system, vascularization, and insulin
secretion. A summary of CDK5 functions as discussed
herein can be found in Table I. CDK5 has recently been
implicated in diseases, including the development and
progression of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
For this reason, the regulation of CDK5 activity is now
emerging as a candidate therapeutic target.

Cyclin dependent kinases are proline-directed
serine/threonine protein kinases that are traditionally
activated upon association with a regulatory subunit.
CDKs are a part of a kinase family that has been
conserved throughout evolution and can be found in
species from Saccharomyces cerevisia to humans. In
humans there are 13 different CDKs (CDK1 - CDK13)
that are highly expressed in mitotic cells [1]. For most
CDKs, activation by a cyclin occurs through association
and phosphorylation of the CDK’s T-loop. Despite having
high amino acid sequence homology with other CDKs,
CDK5 is unusual because it is not typically activated
upon binding with a cyclin and does not require T-loop
phosphorylation for activation. Additionally, CDK5
has functions in both terminally differentiated and
proliferating cells [2]. CDK5 was first identified in 1992
by multiple groups and was given a different name by
each, including tau kinase II [3], neuronal Cdc2 like
kinase [4], brain proline-directed kinase [5], PSSALRE
[6], and CDK5 [7]. An isoform of CDK5, termed either
CDK5-SV or CDK5-V1, was recently discovered [8, 9].
One study reported that this splice variant lacks 32 amino
acids encoded by exon 7 [8], while another study stated

CDK5 ACTIVATORS AND REGULATORS

can phosphorylate p35 at Ser8 and Thr138. In the
brain, phosphorylation of S8 is constant throughout
development, but phosphorylation of T138 is found more
abundantly in fetal brain tissue [23]. The phosphorylation
at S8 leads to a more diffuse localization throughout the
cytoplasm. This could be due to increased p35 mobility
on membranes due to an altered interaction between the
protein and phospholipids that constitute cell membranes
[24]. p35 phosphorylation at T138 prevents its cleavage to
p25 by calpain [23]. Because CDK5 has various regulatory
functions in neuron development and migration, it is likely
that the phosphorylation of p35 at T138 protects against
aberrant CDK5 activation through formation of p25 in
the fetal stage of brain development when CDK5 activity
is also high [1]. Additionally, in vitro, under conditions
of oxidative stress, p35 has been found conjugated to
SUMO2 at Lys246 and Lys290, which led to increased
p35/CDK5 activity [25].

Unlike other CDKs, CDK5 is not primarily
activated by cyclins. Instead it is through specific binding
with the proteins p35 or p39, or their respective cleaved
counterparts p25 and p29, that CDK5 becomes active
[1, 17, 18]. It was found that p35 knockout mice have
defective cortical lamination and adults suffered from
sporadic lethality and seizures [19], which is a less severe
phenotype than that exhibited by Cdk5 knockout mice
[20]. p39-/- mice did not display any obvious abnormalities,
however p35/p39 compound knockout mice displayed
a phenotype identical to that of the Cdk5-/- mice [21],
suggesting that while p39 may not play a pivotal role in
Cdk5 activation, it becomes necessary for nervous system
development in the absence of p35.
p35 has a myristolation sequence that localizes
it to phospholipid membranes [22]. Active CDK5

As previously mentioned, the CDK5 activator p25 is
formed through cleavage of p35 by calpain. This produces
both the p25 product as well as a p10 product. Cleavage
of p35 occurs under stress conditions such as amyloidβ
presence, excitotoxicity, or oxidative stress [22, 26]. This
cleavage allows p25 to localize to nuclear and perinuclear
regions by removing the p10 myristolation sequence
[22]. Compared with p35, p25 has a longer half-life, and
therefore prolongs the activation period of CDK5, leading
to increased phosphorylation of CDK5’s target proteins
[22, 27].
The functions of CDK5 activators p39 and p29
largely overlap with those of p35 and p25, respectively,
however their expression throughout brain regions vary.
p39 and p29 are mainly expressed in postnatal cerebral
cortex and the hindbrain while p35 and p25 are largely
expressed in the cerebral cortex of developing brains
[27]. The localization of p39 to membranes is similar to
that of p35 due to its conserved myristolation sequence
[22]. Likewise, p39 also shows a more diffuse localization
upon phosphorylation of Ser8 by CDK5 [24]. p39 can
be phosphorylated by CDK5 at Ser173, a site equivalent
to T138 in p35, and Thr84, however the effect of these
phosphorylations on controlling protein stability have not
yet been explored [1, 24].

In addition to p35 and p39, cyclin I has also been
shown to activate CDK5. Cyclin I-CDK5 binding targets
CDK5 to the nucleus [28] and increases levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bcl2l1 via the MEK/ERK
pathway [29]. This upregulation of Bcl2 and Bcl211 is
observed only through cyclin I activation of CDK5, not
activation via p35 [29, 30]. CDK5 has been found to bind
cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 in human fibroblasts, however
this interaction had no influence on the activation and
kinase activity of CDK5 [7, 31].
While CDK5 is only activated by p35/p25, p39/p29,
or cyclin I, the activity of CDK5 can be modulated by
a variety of other proteins, as depicted in Figure 1. For
instance, cyclin D1 can attenuate CDK5 kinase activity
by competing with p35 for binding with CDK5, thereby
forming an inactive complex of cyclin D1 and CDK5 (Fig.
1). CDK5 and cyclin D1 can be found in the rat cerebellum
during the first 24 days of postnatal development, albeit at
varying abundances. CDK5 abundance increased while
cyclin D1 decreased from day 9 on to adulthood [32]. In
post-mitotic neurons, cyclin D1/CDK5 association was
found to lead to cell cycle related neuronal apoptosis
through sustained MEK/ERK signaling [33].
Cyclin E can directly interact with Cdk5 to reduce
its activity. Cyclin E was found to sequester mouse

Cdk5 away from other protein activators along with
p27KIP1. The formation of this complex, and consequent
attenuation of Cdk5 activity was found to promote
synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and dendritic
growth, as cyclin E-/- mice, that had increased Cdk5
activity, were deficient in these processes [34]. While
this result may seem counterintuitive due to active
CDK5’s function with supporting neurite outgrowths, this
observation could be explained by an overabundance of
active CDK5 detrimentally effecting neurite outgrowth
and subsequently synaptic plasticity. This theory would
be consistent with findings that CDK5 expression levels
are increased in certain neurodegenerative diseases, and
that it is the aberrant CDK5 activity that leads to neurite
collapse and death [35-37].
Glutathione-S-transferase (GSTP1) is another
regulator of CDK5 activity that functions by competing
with p35 for CDK5 binding. GSTP1 also reduces aberrant
CDK5 activity by scavenging for molecules associated
with oxidative stress and thereby decreasing the likelihood
of p35/p39 cleavage to p25/p29 [38] (Figure 1).
TP53 induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase
(TIGAR) has been shown to upregulate CDK5 expression
levels in the presence of induced DNA damage (Figure 1).
Knockdown of TIGAR led to decreased CDK5 expression,

decreased phosphorylated ATM, and consequently
increased levels of induced DNA damage. This suggests
that DNA damage repair is mediated via TIGAR activation
of the CDK5-ATM pathway [39].

CDK5 IN CELL CYCLE AND OTHER
PATHWAYS
Previously, CDK5 was thought to function in
a cell cycle independent manner; however, recently
the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) was discovered as a
downstream target of CDK5. Expression of CDK5
leads to the phosphorylation of Rb, ultimately leading
to the expression of cyclins and other cdks [40]. The
protein kinase CK1 is phosphorylated by CDK5, and is
involved in a wide array of signaling pathways including
cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis [41]. When CDK5
phosphorylates CK1, its kinase activity is subsequently
reduced [42]. The functional affect of CDK5-mediated
phosphorylation of CK1 on cell cycle, DNA repair, or
apoptosis has yet to be explored.
In pancreatic β cells, CDK5 activity reduces insulin
secretion in response to glucose abundance (Figure 2).
This was demonstrated using CDK5 inhibitors, as well

as inhibition of CDK5’s activator p35. When CDK5 is
active, it phosphorylates the L-type voltage-dependent
Ca+2 channel (L-VDCC) at Ser783, which prevents the
association of L-VDCC with syntaxin and SNAP-25,
thereby preventing exocytosis of insulin from the cell [13].
Within the immune system, CDK5 has been
implicated in IFNγ-induced programmed death ligand
1 (PD-L1) upregulation, which allows certain cells
to evade detection by the immune system. Decreased
CDK5 expression led to increased expression of the
PD-L1 transcriptional repressors IRF2 and IRF2BP and
consequent decreased PD-L1 expression (Figure 2) [43].
PD-L1 is a ligand that binds with PD-1, which is found
on various immune cells. The binding of PD-L1 and
PD-1 decreases an immune response by inhibiting T-cell
activation and cytokine production. In normal tissues this
is vital for maintaining homeostasis [44]. However tumor
cells can also express PD-L1, which allows them to avoid
detection and elimination by T-cells [45, 46].
CDK5 promotes the formation of lymphatic vessels.
CDK5 phosphorylates Foxc2, a protein that regulates the
expression of connexin 37, which is critical for lymphatic
valve formation (Figure 2). Moreover, knockout of CDK5
in the endothelium leads to lymphedema formation and
embryonic lethality in mice [47].
CDK5 has previously been implicated in the
migration of neurons. CDK5 knockout mice have
abnormal cortical lamination, and more than 60% of
CDK5-/- mice died in utero [20]. Various studies have
since implicated CDK5 in cell migration as it governs
cancer metastasis. In prostate cancer cells, inhibition of
CDK5 by the drug roscovitine prevented cell migration.
The roscovitine treated cells did not project lamellopodia,
and had reduced tubulin structures compared to untreated
cells. This suggests that CDK5 inhibition prevented the
establishment of cell polarity required for movement [48].
Additionally, knockdown of CDK5 in melanoma cell
lines decreased cell motility and cell spreading in vitro,
and decreased formation of lung and liver metastases in
vivo in a mouse model of human melanoma. The decrease
in CDK5 expression led to decreased phosphorylation
of caldesmon, which decreased its binding affinity with
actin and calmodulin (Figure 2) [49]. Another mechanism
by which CDK5 may promote cell migration is by
enhancing pro-migratory P13K/AKT signaling. CDK5
phosphorylates the Gα –interacting vesicle associated
protein (GIV), which promotes GIV interaction with Gαi,
thereby enhancing P13K/AKT signaling (Figure 2) [50].
Together, these studies demonstrate the importance of
CDK5 in cell motility, a naturally occurring and necessary
process. However, CDK5 mediated movement could also
be an underlying driver of cancer metastasis and could be
targeted in treatments to halt cancer metastasis.

An important function of CDK5, especially in
neurons, is the organization of the cytoskeleton and
support of cellular outgrowths (Figure 2). Expression of
p35 or p39 in vitro stimulates neurite outgrowths, and a
dominant negative mutant of CDK5 was found to abolish
the formation of these outgrowths [51]. CDK5 supports
axon and neurite outgrowth is through phosphorylation of
the neurofilament heavy chain, resulting in the assembly
of neurofilaments [52].
CDK5 has been shown to both prevent and promote
growth cone collapse under different circumstances.
CDK5 phosphorylates the protein CRMP2A at Ser27,
which can be stabilized by Pin1 to support the growth of
growth cones in the presence of semaphorin3A stimulation
[53, 54]. Additionally, CDK5 can promote axonal growth
through indirect activation of CRMP2 by phosphorylating
the protein Axin. Phosphorylated Axin inhibits GSK3β
activity, leading to an increase in active, unphosphorylated
CRMP2 [55] (Figure 2).
Conversely, CDK5 promotes the collapse of growth
cones through association with CRMP2 and α2-chimerin,
an adaptor protein between CRMP2 and CDK5-p35. This
association of CRMP2, α2-chimerin, and CDK5-p35
promotes the phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Ser522 by
CDK5. In turn, this allows for CRMP2 to associate with
and be phosphorylated at T514 by GSK3β, resulting in
CRMP2 inactivation, microtubule disassembly, and
ultimately growth cone collapse [56]. In this manner,
CDK5 activity can both prevent and promote collapse of
growth cones.
CDK5 can also reduce cellular outgrowth
by regulating cytoskeletal organization through
phosphorylation of p35 at T138, which prevents the
polymerization of microtubules. This phosphorylation at
T138 is found primarily in fetal brain tissues as opposed
to adult brain [23].

ROLE OF CDK5 IN NEUROLOGICAL
DISEASE
Due to the many roles of CDK5 in the development
of the nervous system, as well as the effects of cellular
stress on CDK5 activation, CDK5 has been implicated
in the progression of various neurological diseases and
as a potential therapeutic target in disease treatment. For
instance, while CDK5 normally phosphorylates collapsin
response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) to stimulate
axon growth, it was found that hyperphosphorylation of
CRMP2, as well as Tau, were implicated in the generation
of neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer’s
disease [53]. Cell stress, including the presence of
amyloid beta, is known to aberrantly activate CDK5 due
to the formation of p25, which has been shown to cause
the hyperphosphorylation of Tau, leading to atypical cell
17378

cycling, synaptotoxicity, and neuronal apoptosis [57].
Additionally, increased CDK5 activity caused by the
sumoylation of p35 under oxidative stress, also contributes
to neurodegeneration [25].
While CDK5 overexpression and aberrant activation
are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, a loss
or reduction in CDK5 activity is implicated in certain
intellectual disabilities and neurodevelopmental disorders.
Decreased CDK5 activity has been associated with
intellectual disability in NF1 microdeletion syndrome
patients [58] and schizophrenia [59]. Additionally,
transgenic mice with decreased Cdk5 activity exhibited
spontaneous seizures [60] as well as behaviors similar to
ADHD [61].

tumors [64].

CDK5 AS A TARGET FOR DISEASE
TREATMENT
Due to the biological and clinically relevant
importance of CDK5’s function in multiple cell types,
CDK5 presents an attractive therapeutic target for
treating a variety of conditions such as diabetes, cancer,
and neurodegeneration. Additionally, the upregulation
of CDK5 associated with various cancers and
neurodegenerative diseases further implicates its role in
the development and progression of disease. Recently,
tamoxifen (TMX), a drug currently used in breast cancer
treatment, was found to decrease CDK5 activation by
competitively binding with p35 and p25, and preventing
their activation of CDK5. While the TMX inhibition of
CDK5 activity could contribute to the anti-tumor effects of
the drug, TMX treatment was also found to decrease Tau
phosphorylation, suggesting a use for tamoxifen in treating
Alzheimer’s disease [66]. However, because of the broad
functions of CDK5 in different cell and tissue types and
the pan CDK inhibitory effect on other family members,
the off target affects of a CDK5 inhibitory drug may create
undesirable side effects. Nonetheless, CDK inhibitors
are an intriguing clinical therapy for the treatment of
various cancers. A list of current cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors, including inhibitors of CDK5, and their
associated clinical trials for the treatment of cancer can be
seen in Table II.
One of the most well studied CDK inhibitors
being used in cancer clinical trials is flavopiridol, a drug
developed by Tolero pharmaceuticals under the name
Alvocidib. Flavopiridol was found to competivively bind
to the ATP-binding pocket of CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and
CDK9, consequently inducing apoptosis in both dividing
and quiescent cells. Early clinical trials with flavopiridol
as a monotherapy proved ineffective in that there was a
narrow window between no clinical response and severe,
lethal tumor lysis. Ongoing trials involve combination
therapies with other novel chemotherapy agents to
overcome the limitations of flavorpiridol [67].
Another relatively well studied CDK inhibitor,
Dinaciclib, was found to be more efficacious than
flavopiridol, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range
(1-4 nM – in various models flavopiridol’s IC50 values
range from 50-350 nM) [67, 68]. Dinaciclib selectively
inhibits CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, and CDK9 [67].
Preclinical studies and early clinical trials demonstrated
the cytotoxicity of Dinaciclib in solid tumors and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, while not affecting T-cell function
or number [69].
Roscovitine, marketed under the name Seliciclib, is
an inhibitor of CDK5 and CDK2. Many of the clinical
trials for Seliciclib were intiated determine dose-limiting
toxicities of the drug alone or in combination with other

CDK5 EXPRESSION IN CANCER
Elevated levels of CDK5 have been found in
various mouse tumors and human malignant tumors
[40] [53, 62-65]. The mechanisms involve effects on
angiogenesis, cell proliferation and the immune system.
As noted above, CDK5 enhances pRb phosphorylation
and thereby cell-cycle progression [40]. Furthermore, CK1
is phosphorylated by CDK5, which in turn governs cell
cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis [41]. Increased levels
of CDK5 target proteins are being considered as possible
biomarkers of specific cancers. For example, an increase
in CRMP2 phosphorylation could be a potential biomarker
for certain lung cancers, as phosphorylated CRMP2 was
found in the nuclei of biopsied lung cancer cells, but not
cells in the surrounding epithelium [53].
In a transgenic mouse model of sporadic medullary
thyroid carcinoma (MTC), p25 overexpression led to
the development of bilateral malignant thyroid tumors,
and was fatal after 30 weeks. However, arresting p25
expression at 5, 11, or 16 weeks led to 100 percent survival
in all mice analyzed after 30 weeks. Similar results were
discovered in vitro, in which reducing p25 expression or
knocking down Cdk5 expression prevented further cell
proliferation. This suggests that it is the aberrant activation
of Cdk5 by p25 that leads to the progression of sporadic
MTC [40].
CDK5 expression in medulloblastoma allows tumor
cells to evade detection by T-cells in vivo. Conversely,
decreased CDK5 expression enhanced the recruitment of
CD4+ T-cells to the tumor site in mice, and increased the
tumor-free survival rate of the mice. CDK5 regulates the
evasion of tumors from the immune system by decreasing
expression of transcriptional repressors of PD-L1
expression, thus increasing the abundance of PD-L1 [45].
Inhibiting CDK5 activity in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cells prevented angiogenesis in vivo
by decreasing the abundance of HIF-1α. Because HCC is
a highly vascularized tumor type, inhibiting CDK5 and
therefore angiogenesis, could prove a promising treatment
for this tumor subtype and other highly vascularized

chemotherapeutics. While roscovitine is used widely
experimentally to inhibit CDK5 activity, it is not being
intensively examined as a clinical cancer therapeutic [67].
To potentially reduce broad undesirable off
target effects of pan-CDK inhibitors, CDK5 inhibitory
peptide (CIP) has been studied as a potential therapeutic
for neurodegeneration. CIP specifically targets the
hyperactivated state of CDK5 as mediated by p25/p29,
while allowing normal activation of CDK5 by p35/p39.
CDK5 inhibitory peptide (CIP) was found to inhibit
the hyperactivation of CDK5 by p25 overexpression in
vivo, which reduced neurodegeneration and improved
cognitive function of transgenic mice, without affecting
neurodevelopment [70]. In the future, CIP could possibly
be adapted to treat certain cancers caused by aberrant
CDK5 activation.
