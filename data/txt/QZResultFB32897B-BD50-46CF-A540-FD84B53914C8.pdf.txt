Abstract
The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met is an attractive target for therapeutic blockade in cancer. Here, we
describe MK-2461, a novel ATP-competitive multitargeted inhibitor of activated c-Met. MK-2461 inhibited
in vitro phosphorylation of a peptide substrate recognized by wild-type or oncogenic c-Met kinases
(N1100Y, Y1230C, Y1230H, Y1235D, and M1250T) with IC50 values of 0.4 to 2.5 nmol/L. In contrast, MK2461 was several hundredfold less potent as an inhibitor of c-Met autophosphorylation at the kinase activation
loop. In tumor cells, MK-2461 effectively suppressed constitutive or ligand-induced phosphorylation of the
juxtamembrane domain and COOH-terminal docking site of c-Met, and its downstream signaling to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase–AKT and Ras–extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, without inhibiting auto‐
phosphorylation of the c-Met activation loop. BIAcore studies indicated 6-fold tighter binding to c-Met when it
was phosphorylated, suggesting that MK-2461 binds preferentially to activated c-Met. MK-2461 displayed significant inhibitory activities against fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor
receptor, and other receptor tyrosine kinases. In cell culture, MK-2461 inhibited hepatocyte growth factor/
c-Met–dependent mitogenesis, migration, cell scatter, and tubulogenesis. Seven of 10 MK-2461–sensitive tumor cell lines identified from a large panel harbored genomic amplification of MET or FGFR2. In a murine
xenograft model of c-Met–dependent gastric cancer, a well-tolerated oral regimen of MK-2461 administered at
100 mg/kg twice daily effectively suppressed c-Met signaling and tumor growth. Similarly, MK-2461 inhibited
the growth of tumors formed by s.c. injection of mouse NIH-3T3 cells expressing oncogenic c-Met mutants.
Taken together, our findings support further preclinical development of MK-2461 for cancer therapy. Cancer

Introduction
c-Met, a member of a receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily
that also includes Ron, is a transmembrane protein composed of an extracellular α chain disulfide-bonded to a membrane-spanning β chain. The tyrosine kinase resides in the
cytosolic portion of the β chain. Binding of hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), the physiologic ligand, to c-Met induces
c-Met dimerization and trans-phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues (Y1234 and Y1235) within the activation loop
of the c-Met kinase domain, triggering conformational
changes that upregulate its catalytic activity (1, 2). Subsequent

phosphorylation of Y1349, Y1356, and Y1365 in the c-Met
COOH terminus creates a docking site that interacts with scaffold and signaling molecules. The resulting signaling complex
activates pathways such as PI3K-PDK1-AKT-mTor, Ras-RacPak, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, and PLC-γ (2–4). In addition to proliferative and antiapoptotic activities, HGF elicits motogenic
and morphogenic cellular phenotypes (2, 5). HGF is also
known to be an angiogenic factor (6).
c-Met was first identified as oncogenic fusion Tpr-Met (7).
Hereditary human papillary renal carcinoma is causally related to germline mutations in the c-Met kinase domain (8, 9).
Aberrant c-Met signaling, resulting from MET genomic amplification, c-Met or HGF overexpression, or c-Met mutations, is
found in a variety of human cancers and often correlated with
poor clinical outcomes (2, 10). Recently, constitutive c-Met activation due to MET amplification was found to be a driver of
proliferation and survival of several gastric and lung cancer
cell lines (11, 12) and has been linked to acquired resistance
of lung cancers to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors (13, 14).
c-Met is an attractive cancer drug target. Small-molecule
c-Met kinase inhibitors and antibodies targeting c-Met or
HGF have exhibited antitumor activities in preclinical models (15–23). Some of these agents are undergoing clinical

development (22, 23). Here, we describe a novel multitargeted kinase inhibitor that preferentially inhibits the activated c-Met.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant kinases. The cytosolic domains of human
c-Met, c-Met mutants, Ron, TrkA, insulin-like growth factor
I receptor (IGF-IR), and Mer were expressed as NH2-terminal
glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions using Baculogold Baculovirus Expression System (BD Bioscience). GST-tagged
KDR and EGFR kinase were from Keith Rickert of Merck Research Labs. His6-tagged Jak2, Flt1, Flt3, Flt4, fibroblast
growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), FGFR2, FGFR3, and TrkB
kinases were from Upstate Biotechnology (Millipore). His6tagged platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)
and the c-Met cytosolic domain were from Invitrogen.
Cell lines. The GTL-16 gastric cancer cell line was from
S. Giordano and P.M. Comoglio (University of Torino Medical

www.aacrjournals.org

School, Turin, Italy); OCUM-1 gastric cancer and EBC-1
lung carcinoma cell lines were from Health Science
Research Resources Bank (Japan); Sum-52 breast cancer
line was from Asterand, Inc.; NIH 3T3 cell lines harboring
c-Met mutations T3936C and T3997C were from L. Schmidt
(National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD); and MadinDarby canine kidney (MDCK) type II cell line was from
Clontech. All other cell lines were from the American Type
Culture Collection.
Murine myeloid 32D cells harboring Tpr-Met fusions.
Tpr-Met and Tpr-Met (Y362) mutant were cloned into pLenti6/
V5-DEST (Invitrogen) and transfected into 293FT packaging
cells (Invitrogen) to produce lentiviruses. The lentiviruses
were used to infect 32D cells, which were then passaged in interleukin 3 (IL-3)–free medium under blasticidin selection to
achieve stable expression of the fusion proteins.
Antibodies. The antibodies used included anti–phosphoc-Met (Y1365), anti–phospho-c-Met (Y1003), and anti–phosphoc-Met (Y1230/Y1234/Y1235) from Biosource; anti–phospho-c-Met

(Y1234/Y1235), anti–phospho-c-Met (Y1349), anti–phosphoFGFR (Y653/Y654), anti–phospho-PDGFR (Y857), anti–phosphoAKT (S473), anti-phospho–extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1/2 (ERK1/2) (T202/Y204), anti–c-Met, anti-PDGFR, anti-AKT,
and anti-ERK1/2 from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-FGFR2
and anti-EGFR from R&D Systems; and anti–phospho-tyrosine
antibody 4G10 from Millipore.
In vitro kinase assays. c-Met–catalyzed phosphorylation
of N-biotinylated peptide (EQEDEPEGDYFEWLE-CONH2)
was measured using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance
energy transfer assay adapted from Park and colleagues (24).
To evaluate kinase selectivity, a single concentration
(1 μmol/L) of MK-2461 was tested using 216 kinases by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Millipore), which also determined
the MK-2461 IC50 for DRAK1, DYRK2, IRAK1, IRAK4, MELK,
and MLK1. The MK-2461 IC50 for Ron, Mer, Flt1, Flt3, Flt4,
KDR, PDGFRβ, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, TrkA, and TrkB were
determined using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy
transfer assays similar to the c-Met kinase assay.
c-Met autophosphorylation assay. The c-Met cytosolic
domain was preincubated with MK-2461. The autophosphorylation was initiated by addition of 50 μmol/L ATP and run for
30 min at 25°C. The reactions were stopped by a denaturing
buffer and by boiling, and then the samples were subjected
to Western blotting with antibodies targeting various phosphotyrosine residues of c-Met.
Analysis of phosphorylation status of c-Met, FGFR2,
PDGFR, EGFR, AKT, and ERK in cells. Tumor cells were
treated for 2 h with MK-2461 or vehicle in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mmol/L
HEPES. When called for, the cells were stimulated with
HGF or EGF during the last 10 min of the 2-h incubation.
The cells were lysed with a denaturing or nondenaturing
buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors and
subjected to Western blot or immunoprecipitation–Western
blot analysis.
Direct binding assay. The His6-tagged c-Met cytosolic
domain (Invitrogen) was immobilized on two detection spots
of a CM5 sensor chip in a BIAcore 51 instrument through an
anti-His antibody and mild cross-linking. The c-Met on one
spot was autophosphorylated by perfusion with MgATP.
Binding kinetics of MK-2461 to the phosphorylated and
unphosphorylated c-Met was then measured simultaneously
using a protocol similar to that described by Nordin and
colleagues (25).
SILAC phosphoproteomic analysis of c-Met in GTL-16
cells. The cells were cultured for six passages in DMEM containing heavy arginine and heavy lysine (13C6-Arg and 13C6-Lys)
or DMEM containing light (12C6) arginine and lysine. Heavylabeled cells were treated for 2 h with 1 μmol/L MK-2461,
whereas the light-labeled cells were treated with the vehicle.
c-Met was immunoprecipitated from a 1:1 mixture of the
heavy- and light-labeled cell lysates, gel-purified, tryptic digested, and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis as previously described
(26, 27). As a “self-to-self” control, a 1:1 mixture of lysates of
vehicle-treated, heavy-labeled and vehicle-treated, light-labeled cells was subjected to the same procedures. The effect of

MK-2461 on the abundance of a phosphotyrosine residue(s) of
interest was gauged from ion-intensity ratio of the heavy (MK2461–treated)– and light (vehicle-treated)–labeled tryptic peptide containing the phosphotyrosine(s). The ratio was normalized using the heavy/light ratio of the self-to-self control.
Assessment of motogenic and morphogenic cellular phenotypes. HGF-induced migration of HPAF II pancreatic cancer cells was measured by a modified Boyden chamber method
using a FluoroBlock 96-Multiwell Insert System (BD Biosciences). The cells in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum were
plated into the upper chamber semisubmerged in the lower
chamber containing the same medium. MK-2461 was added
to both chambers and the plate was incubated for 2 h. HGF
was then added to the lower chamber and the plate was incubated for an additional 20 h. Viable cells on the underside of

Figure 2. Representative BIAcore data showing that MK-2461 binds
more strongly to phosphorylated c-Met than to unphosphorylated c-Met.
The His6-tagged c-Met cytosolic domain was immobilized on two
detection spots of a sensor chip. One spot was perfused with ATP to
induce c-Met autophosphorylation. Both spots were then perfused with a
MK-2461–containing buffer and then with a MK-2461–free buffer.
A 2-fold dilution series of MK-2461 was tested. The surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) signals recorded from the spot with unphosphorylated
c-Met (A) and the spot with phosphorylated c-Met (B) are shown. The rate
constants kon and koff were obtained from fitting each data set globally
with a 1:1 interaction model. The smooth lines represent the best fits. The
equilibrium constant Kd was calculated as koff/kon.

the membrane were stained using Calcein AM (Invitrogen)
and quantified using a fluorescence reader. HGF-induced
scatter of HPAF II cells was measured as described previously
(28). HGF-induced tubulogenesis of MDCK cells was monitored as described by Yamaguchi and colleagues (29).
Proliferation and mitogenic assays. Proliferation and
viability of tumor cells was measured using the ViaLight
PLUS kit (Cambrex). HGF-dependent mitogenic activity of
4MBr monkey lung cells was measured by monitoring bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation into genomic DNA
using the Roche Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdUrd (chemiluminescence) kit.
Tumor xenograft models. GTL-16 cells or c-Met mutanttransformed NIH3T3 cells were inoculated s.c. into the flank
of female nude CD-1 nu/nu mice. When mean tumor size
reached a predetermined range, the mice were randomized
and given vehicle or MK-2461 by p.o. gavage once or twice
daily. Tumor volumes were determined using calipers. The
percentage increase in the volume of a xenograft tumor on
day n versus day 0 (the day when dosing of MK-2461 began)
was calculated as (tumor volume on day n − tumor volume
on day 0) / tumor volume on day 0 × 100. The mean percentage
of tumor growth inhibition in each MK-2461–treated group
relative to the vehicle-treated group was calculated as
(1 − mean percent increase of tumor volume in the MK2461–treated group/mean percent increase of the tumor
volume in the vehicle-treated group) × 100.
Measurement of c-Met (Y1349) phosphorylation in
xenograft tumors. Mice bearing GTL-16 tumors were euthanized 1 h after p.o. administration of MK-2461. The tumors
were excised, snap-frozen, and dispersed using a Qiagen TissueLyser in a nondenaturing lysis buffer containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors. The homogenate was lysed at 4°C
for 1 h, clarified by centrifugation, and then analyzed by quantitative Western blotting for phospho–c-Met (Y1349) and total
c-Met. The pMet (Y1349) signal of each c-Met band was normalized with its total c-Met signal. To combine or compare
data from several gels, the pY1349/total Met ratio for each
c-Met band was further normalized to the average pY1349/
total c-Met ratio of the vehicle-treated tumor samples on
the same gel.

Results
MK-2461 is a potent ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor
that preferentially binds the activated c-Met. MK-2461
(Supplementary Fig. S1) inhibited the kinase activity of
human c-Met with a mean IC50 of 2.5 nmol/L in the presence
of 50 μmol/L ATP. Steady-state kinetics experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2) showed that MK-2461 is competitive
with ATP and noncompetitive with respect to the peptide
substrate.
The effect of MK-2461 on ATP-induced autophosphorylation of recombinant c-Met cytosolic domain was determined
by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, MK-2461 was substantially more potent against the autophosphorylation of
Y1349 (IC50 ≈100 nmol/L) and Y1365 (IC50 ≈26 nmol/L) in

or vehicle, stimulated with EGF for 10 min, and then lysed. EGFR
was immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blotting with an

the COOH-terminal docking site than the autophosphorylation of the activation loop [IC50 was ∼900 nmol/L as determined using an anti-pMet (Y1234/Y1235) antibody and was
>2 μmol/L as determined using an anti-pMet (Y1230/1234/
1235) antibody].
We next used GTL-16 gastric cancer cells, which harbor
MET genomic amplification and overexpress constitutively
activated c-Met protein, to assess the cellular activities of
MK-2461 against phosphorylation of c-Met and its downstream signaling. MK-2461 potently inhibited the phosphorylation of three nonactivation loop tyrosine residues of c-Met,
Y1003 in the juxtamembrane domain and Y1349 and Y1365
in the COOH-terminal docking site (IC50 ≈50 nmol/L). This
was accompanied by a concentration-dependent inhibition
of phosphorylation of two key downstream signaling molecules, AKT (S473) and ERK1/2 (T202/Y204; Fig. 1B). In contrast, MK-2461 had little effect on c-Met activation loop
(Y1234/Y1235) phosphorylation, even at concentrations up
to 2.5 μmol/L (Fig. 1B). Very similar results were obtained from
A549 lung cancer cells, which were used to assess the effects of
MK-2461 on HGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, AKT, and
ERK1/2 (Fig. 1C).
The effects of MK-2461 on c-Met phosphorylation in GTL16 cells were further quantified using SILAC mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1D, treatment of GTL-16 cells with
1 μmol/L MK-2461 caused a 98% decrease in the abundance

of a c-Met COOH-terminal peptide dually phosphorylated
at Y1349 and Y1356, and 83% decrease in the abundance of
the same peptide singly phosphorylated at either Y1349 or
Y1356. This was accompanied by a 64% decrease in the abundance of a peptide containing phosphorylated Y1003 of the
juxtamembrane domain and a 47% reduction in the abundance of an activation loop–derived peptide singly phosphorylated at Y1234. In contrast MK-2461 caused a moderate

increase (25%) in the abundance of the activation loop peptide dually phosphorylated at Y1234 and Y1235.
The ability of MK-2461 to inhibit autophosphorylation of
the juxtamembrane domain and COOH-terminal docking site
of c-Met while remaining essentially inactive against dual tyrosine (Y1234 and Y1235) phosphorylation of the c-Met activation loop is consistent with MK-2461 binding preferentially
to the activation loop–phosphorylated c-Met. To test this

MK-2461, a Novel Multitargeted Kinase Inhibitor

model, the binding of MK-2461 to phosphorylated and
unphosphorylated c-Met cytosolic domain was directly
measured using BIAcore (Fig. 2). Two independent experiments showed that the average equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of MK-2461 for phosphorylated c-Met (4.0 nmol/L)
is 6-fold lower than that for unphosphorylated c-Met (25.1
nmol/L). The higher affinity of MK-2461 for phosphorylated
c-Met resulted from faster association rate constant (kon)
and slower dissociation rate constant (koff). These findings
provided direct evidence that MK-2461 preferentially binds
the activated conformations of c-Met.
In vitro activity of MK-2461 against c-Met mutants.
Several oncogenic c-Met mutations reportedly confer resistance to certain c-Met kinase inhibitors (15, 16, 30, 31).
We thus compared in vitro potencies of MK-2461 against
wild-type c-Met and five c-Met mutants, including three
activation loop mutants (Y1230C, Y1230H, and Y1235D), a
P + 1 loop mutant M1250T, and N1100Y, which is near the
ATP binding site. In the presence of 50 μmol/L ATP, MK2461 is equally or more potent against the five mutants (mean
IC50 ranging from 0.4 to 1.5 nmol/L) compared with the wildtype c-Met (mean IC50 = 2.5 nmol/L; Supplementary Table S1).
Kinase selectivity of MK-2461. In vitro kinase assays revealed that Ron (IC50 = 7 nmol/L) and Flt1 (IC50 = 10 nmol/L)
were inhibited by MK-2461 with similar potencies to c-Met
(IC50 = 2.5 nmol/L), whereas nine other kinases, including
FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, PDGFRβ, KDR, Flt3, Flt4, TrkA, and
TrkB, were found to be 8- to 30-fold less sensitive to MK-2461
than c-Met (Supplementary Table S1). We further evaluated the
effect of MK-2461 on autophosphorylation of FGFR2 and
PDGFR-α, respectively, in KATO III cells, which overexpress
constitutively activated FGFR2 (32), and H1703 cells, which
overexpress constitutively activated PDGFR-α (33). MK-2461
potently inhibited phosphorylation of the activation loop of
FGFR2 (Y653/Y654) and PDGFR-α (Y849) in the cells with
IC50 <300 nmol/L (Fig. 3A and B). These observations contrast
with the inability of MK-2461 to inhibit activation loop phosphorylation in c-Met. Consistent with its lack of inhibitory
activity against recombinant EGFR kinase, MK-2461 did not
inhibit ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR in A549 lung
cancer cells (Fig. 3C).
Inhibition by MK-2461 of HGF/c-Met–dependent cellular
phenotypes. MK-2461 inhibited HGF-induced mitogenesis
(measured as BrdUrd incorporation) of 4MBr-5 monkey lung
epithelial cells (34) with an IC50 of 204 ± 44 nmol/L (mean ± SE,
n = 5). (The result of a representative experiment is shown
in Supplementary Fig. S3.) The compound inhibited HGFinduced scattering of HPAF II human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (35) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), with
a mean IC50 of 416 ± 26 nmol/L (SE, n = 23) as determined by an
automated imaging assay (28). Using a modified multiwell
Boyden chamber system, we found that MK-2461 inhibited
HGF-induced migration of HPAF II cells with a mean IC50 of
404 ± 47 nmol/L (SE, n = 11). (A representative experiment is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.) MK-2461 inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the HGF-induced branching
tubulogenesis of MDCK cells in a three-dimensional collagen
gel matrix (Fig. 4B).

Figure 5. In vitro antiproliferative potencies of MK-2461 against a tumor
cell line panel. The cells were treated in triplicate for 72 h with various
concentrations of MK-2461. The numbers of viable cells were measured
using Vialight Plus assay. The data were fitted with a four-parameter
dose-response equation and the inflection point of the least-square fit
curve was reported as IC50. Cells harboring MET gene amplification,
FGFR2 amplification, and constitutively activated PDGFR are labeled
with a single (*), double (**), and triple asterisks (***), respectively.

To assess the cellular activity of MK-2461 against oncogenic c-Met activation loop mutants, we tested the effect of
MK-2461 on proliferation of 32D murine myeloid leukemia
cells transformed by Tpr-Met or Tpr-Met (Y362C) mutant,
which is equivalent to the c-Met activation loop mutant
Y1230C. The 32D/Tpr-Met and 32D/Tpr-Met (Y362C) cells
acquired the ability to proliferate in the absence of IL-3,
which was needed to support proliferation and survival of
the parental 32D cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, MK-2461 potently
inhibited IL-3–independent growth of 32D/Tpr-Met and
32D/Tpr-Met (Y362C) cells (IC50 ≈100 nmol/L). Importantly,
MK-2461 was ∼100-fold less potent in inhibiting IL-3–dependent
proliferation of the parental 32D cells, indicating that the
potent antiproliferative effects of MK-2461 on the TprMet–expressing cells resulted from specific inhibition of
Tpr-Met signaling.
Genomic amplification and constitutive activation of
c-Met, FGFR2, or PDGFR are predictors of in vitro tumor
response to MK-2461. The potency of MK-2461 for inhibiting in vitro proliferation and viability of tumor cells was

quantitative Western blotting.

IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to >30 μmol/L (Fig. 5). The cell
lines were classified into three groups, described as being
sensitive (IC50 ≤1 μmol/L), moderately sensitive (1 μmol/L <
IC50 ≤ 5 μmol/L), and insensitive (IC50 >5 μmol/L) to MK2461. Among the 10 MK-2461–sensitive cell lines, GTL-16
and SNU5 gastric cancer cell lines and EBC-1 and H1993
non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines were previously
reported to overexpress constitutively activated c-Met protein due to MET genomic amplification (11, 12, 36). In
addition, KATO III, SNU16 gastric cancer cell lines, and
SUM-52 breast cancer cell line were previously shown to overexpress constitutively activated FGFR2 protein due to FGFR2
genomic amplification (32, 37). The H1703 non–small cell lung
carcinoma cell line was confirmed, by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3B), to harbor a high level of constitutively activated
PDGFR as previously reported (33). Neither overexpression
nor constitutive activation of MET, FGFR, or PDGFR was detected (data not shown) in the two remaining MK-2461–senstive
cell lines, KM12 colon cancer cell line and H1048 small-cell lung
carcinoma cell line. With the exception of the MKN-45 gastric
cancer line (IC 50 = 1.2 μmol/L), known to harbor MET
genomic amplification (36), all tumor cell lines classified
as moderately sensitive or insensitive to MK-2461 did not
show MET or FGFR2 amplification and express only low
levels of functional c-Met protein, which was not phosphorylated under the condition of the proliferation assay (data
not shown). These results show that c-Met or FGFR2

are predictive biomarkers of in vitro tumor response to

MK-2461 inhibited c-Met signaling and tumor growth in
tumor xenograft models in mice. To assess the in vivo potency of MK-2461 for inhibiting c-Met, the extent of c-Met
Y1349 phosphorylation in GTL-16 tumors was measured
1 hour after the tumor-bearing mice were given an oral bolus
of MK-2461 at several dose levels. Plasma samples were
analyzed for total concentration of MK-2461. Dose-dependent
inhibition of phosphorylation of tumor c-Met (Y1349) was
observed and found to be correlated with the concentration
of MK-2461 in the plasma. From the relationship between the
plasma MK-2461 concentration and tumor phospho–c-Met
(Y1349), the in vivo IC50 of MK-2461 for c-Met inhibition
was estimated to be 1.0 μmol/L (Fig. 6A).
Two independent efficacy studies were conducted to assess the in vivo antitumor activity of MK-2461 in nude mice
bearing established subcutaneous GTL-16 tumors. In the first
experiment (Fig. 6B), mice were treated with vehicle or one of
four 21-day p.o. regimens of MK-2461 [10, 50, and 100 mg/kg
twice daily (bid) and 200 mg/kg once daily], which inhibited
tumor growth by 62%, 77%, 75%, and 90%, respectively. The
mean terminal tumor weights of the four MK-2461 cohorts
were 427 ± 91 mg (SE, n = 10), 358 ± 81 mg (n = 12), 340 ±
46 mg (n = 13), and 232 ± 52 mg (n = 13), compared with the
mean tumor weight of 1,129 ± 231 mg (n = 9) for the vehicle

MK-2461, a Novel Multitargeted Kinase Inhibitor

cohort. Statistical analyses showed that each of the four
MK-2461 regimens had significant growth-inhibitory effect
compared with the vehicle. In the second efficacy study,
which evaluated five 21-day p.o. MK-2461 regimens (1, 3,
10, 30, and 100 mg/kg bid), the 100 mg/kg bid regimen caused
essentially complete (99%) tumor growth inhibition, whereas
the other four MK-2461 regimens did not result in statistically
significant tumor growth inhibition (Supplemental Fig. S5).
All MK-2461 regimens tested in the two studies were well
tolerated, causing neither statistically significant loss in mean
body weight nor treatment-related death.
We also tested a MK-2461 p.o. regimen (134 mg/kg bid) in
two mouse xenograft models derived from NIH3T3 cells
transformed by c-Met single nucleotide mutants T3936C
and T3997C, respectively. The mutations are equivalent to
Y1230H and M1250T mutations of human c-Met. Based on
the tumor growth curves from day 0 to day 16, MK-2461 inhibited
growth of T3936C and T3997C tumors by 78% (Fig. 6C) and
62% (Fig. 6D), respectively, and the growth-inhibitory effects of MK-2461 in both models were statistically significant.
These results showed the capacity of MK-2461 to inhibit c-Met
mutation–driven tumors in vivo.

Discussion
Here, we have identified MK-2461, a novel ATP-competitive
multitargeted kinase inhibitor. Several lines of findings
strongly suggest that MK-2461 preferentially binds to the
activated c-Met with dual-phosphorylated activation loop
and inhibits c-Met signaling by suppressing phosphorylation
of tyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane domain and
COOH-terminal docking site of c-Met. These properties
distinguish MK-2461 from other known ATP-competitive
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which either bind to the unactivated and active kinase with similar affinity or preferentially
bind the unactivated kinase (38, 39). Additional studies will be
needed to decipher the molecular mechanism that allows the
activation loop in MK-2461–bound c-Met molecules to remain fully phosphorylated in the face of a cytosolic environment rich in protein phosphatases.
Significantly, we found that MK-2461 effectively inhibited
autophosphorylation of the activation loop of FGFR2 and
PDGFR in cells (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that
MK-2461 is capable of preventing activation of FGFR2 and
PDGFR, presumably by binding to the unactivated conformation of these kinases. The differences between the binding
modes of MK-2461 to c-Met and to FGFR2 may contribute
to the observation that MK-2461 exhibits more potent antiproliferative activity in FGFR2-driven cells than in c-Met–
driven cells, despite in vitro kinase assays showing that
MK-2461 is more potent against c-Met than against FGFR2.
Structural studies of several unactivated tyrosine kinases revealed that parts of the activation loop and/or other structural elements assume configurations that border or block
the ATP binding site (40–43). Therefore, the unactivated conformation may have significantly lower affinity for ATP than
does the active conformation (38, 39). Compared with inhibi-

tors preferentially binding to the unactivated conformation,
inhibitors preferentially binding to the active conformation
face stronger competition from cellular ATP and are thus
likely to show a larger potency reduction in cell-based assays
relative to cell-free assays. Imatinib, which preferentially
binds an unactivated conformation of BCR-Abl, is known
to bind an active, DFG-in conformation of spleen tyrosine kinase, providing a precedent that a tyrosine kinase inhibitor
adopts different binding modes in different kinase contexts (44).
In a majority of receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Met,
the phosphotyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane domain
and in the region COOH-terminal to the conserved kinase
domain seem to be primarily responsible for recruiting adaptor proteins and signaling molecules. However, the phosphorylated activation loop of insulin receptor tyrosine
kinase has been shown to bind and signal through adaptor
proteins APS and Grb10/14 (45, 46). MK-2461 does not block
activation loop phosphorylation of c-Met and would be ineffective in inhibiting signaling events that emanate from the
signaling or adaptor proteins that interact with the activation loop of c-Met. Comparative studies using MK-2461
and c-Met inhibitors capable of inhibiting c-Met activation
loop phosphorylation may allow identification of signaling
molecules and pathways that are differentially modulated
by c-Met inhibitors of different modes of action.
MK-2461 was equally or slightly more potent against five
naturally occurring oncogenic human c-Met mutants
(N1100Y, Y1230C, Y1230H, Y1235D, and M1250T) compared
with wild-type c-Met and inhibited the growth of NIH3T3
tumors harboring murine equivalents of human c-Met
Y1230H and M1250T mutants. To date, about 15 c-Met kinase domain missense mutations have been detected in papillary renal carcinomas, with the tyrosine residues Y1230 and
Y1235 in the c-Met activation loop being “hotspots” for
mutations (2). The missense mutations of Y1230 and
Y1235 confer absolute or partial resistance to several
known c-Met inhibitors, including PF-04217903, a c-Met inhibitor currently undergoing clinical development (15, 16,
30, 31). A novel class of c-Met inhibitors represented by
AM7 (16) exhibits uncompromised inhibitory activities
against these c-Met mutants. MK-2461, which is structurally distinct from AM7, represents a new pharmacophore
with this desirable biological property. The c-Met inhibitors potent against a broad spectrum of activating c-Met
mutants may hold promise for treatment of papillary renal
cell carcinoma.
Genomic amplification of c-Met or FGFR2 occurs at higher
frequencies in gastric cancers (47, 48) and is believed to be a
major driver of malignancy (11, 12, 32). A dual c-Met/FGFR2
inhibitor such as MK-2461 is, potentially, a promising therapeutic for the subset of gastric cancers that display either
Met or FGFR2 amplification.
In summary, MK-2461 is a novel orally available multitargeted kinase inhibitor, which inhibits c-Met signaling
and HGF/c-Met–dependent cellular phenotypes by selectively targeting the active conformation of c-Met. It also
exhibits significant activities toward several other oncology
kinase targets, including FGFR and PDGFR. It has signifi-
