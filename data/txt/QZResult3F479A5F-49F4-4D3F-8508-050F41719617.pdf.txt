p53 is essential for the cellular responses to DNA damage that help to maintain genomic stability.
However, the great majority of human cancers undergo disruption of the p53-network.
Identification and characterization of molecular components important in both p53-dependent and
-independent apoptosis might be useful in developing novel therapies for cancers. In the complete
absence of p53, cells treated with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) continue to synthesize
DNA slowly and eventually progress through S phase, suffering severe DNA damage that in turn
triggers apoptosis, whereas cells with functional p53 undergo growth arrest. In the present study,
we investigated apoptotic signaling in response to PALA and the role of p53 expression in this
pathway. We found that treatment of cells lacking p53 with PALA induced TAp73, Noxa, and
Bim and inactivation of these proteins with dominant negative plasmids or siRNAs significantly
inhibited apoptosis, suggesting that PALA-induced apoptosis was mediated via TAp73-dependent
expression of Noxa and Bim. However, PALA treatment inhibited the expression of ΔNp73 only
in cells lacking p53 but not in cells expressing p53. In addition, PALA treatment inhibited Bcl-2,
and overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly inhibited PALA-induced apoptosis. Moreover,
expression of p53 in these cells protected them from PALA-induced apoptosis by activating p21,
sustaining the expression of ΔNp73 and inhibiting the induction of Noxa and Bim. Taken together,
our study identifies novel but opposing roles for the p53 and TAp73 in the induction of Noxa and
Bim and regulation of apoptosis. Our data will help to develop strategies to eliminate cancer cells
lacking p53 while protecting normal cells with wild-type p53.

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

p53 plays a pivotal role in the pathways that prevent the development of cancer by inducing
apoptosis, DNA repair and cell-cycle arrest in response to different types of cellular stress
(1–3). p53 is also critical for the action of many chemotherapy and chemopreventive drugs
(4–7). Unfortunately, the majority of tumors harbor mutations affecting the p53 gene, and
those tumors that have wild-type p53 protein most probably lack a functional p53 response
as a result of mutations affecting other genes that function in the same pathways as p53 (8,
9). In addition to p53, mammalian cells contain two closely related proteins, p63 and p73,
which share overlapping functions with p53 and regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (10–
14). However, some of the genes transcribed by p73 are specific for p73 (15). Because of the
presence of an alternative promoter in the third intron and due to alternative splicing at the
C-terminal end, p73 protein has multiple isoforms with distinct functions (14). Usage of the
most upstream P1 promoter generates the transactivating (TA) isoforms, whereas that of the
downstream P2 promoter yields amino-terminal truncated proteins (ΔNp73) that lack the TA
domain. At least 7 different transcripts (α, β, γ, ζ, δ, ε, η) are known to be generated due to
alternative splicing at the C-terminus. Another group of ΔNp73 isoforms, known as
ΔTAp73, were generated from alternative splicing targeting the N-terminus of the transcript
generated from the P1 promoter (14). Studies suggest that p73 plays essential roles in
determining cellular sensitivity to many anticancer drugs, particularly in tumors lacking
functional p53 (12, 13, 16–18). However, TAp73 and ΔNp73 have opposing roles. Although
TAp73 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, ΔNp73 functions as a dominant negative for
TAp73 and promotes survival and has an oncogenic function.

Unlike p53, mutations in p73 are extremely rare in human cancers (14, 16, 19–21).
However, the expression of p73 is frequently dysregulated in human tumors (14).
Overexpression of p73 mRNA and/or protein was observed in breast (22, 23), ovarian (24),
hepatocellular (25), neuroblastoma (26), bladder (27), prostate (28) and colorectal (29)
cancers. On the other hand, frequent loss of p73 was observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(30). Isoform-specific differences in the expression of p73 were also observed between
normal and malignant tissues; α and β are the predominant isoforms in normal tissues
whereas other C-terminal splice variants were expressed in tumor tissues. Silencing of p73
due to the loss of allele 1 at 1p36 and promoter methylation or mutation was found in
neuroblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Burkitt’s and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
In most thyroid carcinomas (31) and B-cell chronic leukemias (32), both TA and δN
isoforms are overexpressed. In contrast, expression of γ, δ, ε, and θ isoforms is also strongly
upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (33). Expression of
ΔNp73 isoforms were also increased in head and neck cancers (34).

N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) is a potent and reversible inhibitor of pyrimidine
nucleotide synthesis in cells (35). Upon treatment with PALA, cells containing wild-type
p53 undergo p53-dependent protective arrest either at G1 and G2 checkpoints or in S-phase,
depending on the levels of p53 in the cells (36–39). In contrast, cells lacking p53 continue
through the cell cycle and incur severe DNA damage, followed by apoptosis (40). Since
most cancer cells lack p53, PALA holds strong promise as a chemotherapeutic agent
targeting cancer cells lacking p53 while protecting normal cells with wild-type p53.
Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that restoration of wild-type p53 in cells
lacking it restored the normal response to PALA (36, 37, 39). However, the signaling
pathways that execute cell death in response to PALA remain to be elucidated.

Activation of caspases is a prerequisite for most apoptosis. Caspases can be activated by
either of two major pathways: the extrinsic pathway, triggered by death receptors such as
Fas, DR5, DR4, and the intrinsic pathway, triggered by cellular stresses (cytokine
deprivation, DNA damage) (41, 42). The Bcl2 family of proteins, which can be subdivided
into two major classes, plays a critical role in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (43–46).
The first group consists of the anti-apoptotic members (Bcl2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Mcl-1),
overexpression of which can prevent apoptosis (43). The second group, or the proapoptotic
Bcl2 members, is divided into effector proteins and the BH3-only proteins. The effector
group consists of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members, Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax)
and Bcl2 antagonist/killer (Bak), deletion of which renders cells highly resistant to
apoptosis. The BH3-only pro-apoptotic subgroup includes Bim, Bad, Puma and Noxa, all of
which contain a BH3 domain (45, 46). Members of this group promote apoptosis when
overexpressed, by inhibiting anti-apoptotic members and/or directly activating Bax/Bak (45,
46). Bim is one of the most potent proapoptotic BH3-only proteins and binds to all
prosurvival Bcl2 family members with high affinity (47). Bim has three isoforms generated
through alternative splicing. All three Bim isoforms namely BimEL, BimL and BimS induce
apoptosis. However, the shorter isoforms are more potent inducers of apoptosis than the
longer isoforms (48) and the basal expression of different Bim isoforms varies among cancer
cell types (49). It was reported previously that Bim is a direct transcriptional target of p73
(50, 51) although p53 negatively regulates the expression of Bim (52, 53).

Author Manuscript

In the current study, we showed for the first time that the p53 family member p73 plays an
essential role in PALA-induced apoptosis by transcriptionally upregulating the proapoptotic
BH3-only proteins Bim and Noxa and downregulating Bcl-2 in cells lacking p53. Rescue of
p53 functions in these cells negatively regulates the expression of Bim and Noxa and has a
cytoprotective effect.

Results
p53 and TAp73 play opposing roles in PALA-induced apoptosis
It was previously established that in the complete absence of p53, PALA-treated cells
continue to synthesize DNA slowly and eventually progress through S phase, suffering
severe DNA damage that in turn triggers apoptosis (40). In contrast, PALA-treated cells
expressing p53 underwent growth arrest without apoptosis (36–39). In order to study the
signaling pathways that trigger apoptosis in response to imbalance in DNA precursors, we

have employed several cell lines expressing wild-type p53, mutant p53 or no p53 and their
isogenic pairs with reconstituted p53 or expressing dominant negative p73 (Materials and
Methods). Expression of dominant negative p73 in 041 and SKOV3 cells was confirmed by
Western blotting using T7 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 1A and B). All the cells were
treated with 250 µM PALA for different time periods, fixed in 70% ethanol, and labeled
with fluorescein-tagged bromodeoxy-uridine triphosphate (Br-dUTP) and propidium iodide
for apoptosis assay (TUNEL). As expected, all cells lacking p53 underwent time-dependent
massive apoptosis in response to PALA and those with wild-type p53 were protected (Fig. 1,
A–C). Interestingly, cells expressing dominant negative p73 were also protected
significantly (p values <0.05) from PALA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and B). Cells
expressing mutant p53 were also sensitive to PALA-induced apoptosis, but to a lesser extent
as compared to cells lacking p53 (Fig. 1D), most probably due to inhibition of TAp73 by
mutant p53 (54). To further confirm the protective role of p53 in PALA-induced apoptosis,
we knocked down p53 in A549 cells which express wild-type p53 using lentivirus-mediated
shRNA (55). A549 cells transduced with control and p53 shRNA were treated with PALA
and apoptosis was measured (Fig. 1E). A549 cells transduced with shGFP were almost
resistant to PALA, whereas ablation of p53 drastically increased apoptosis, further
confirming the protective role of p53. We also confirmed the proapoptotic role of TAp73 by
ablating TAp73 expression in SKOV3 cells using siRNA (supplementary Fig. S1C).
Ablation of p73 significantly inhibited apoptosis (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results
suggest that the family members p53 and TAp73 play opposing roles in response to PALA;
p53 protects cells, whereas TAp73 mediates cells death. Since cells expressing dominant
negative p73 do not undergo apoptosis, we examined whether PALA treatment induces
growth inhibition or cell cycle arrest of these cells. Although cells expressing dominant
negative p73 initially accumulated at G1, this was transient and cells started to grow again
(supplementary Fig. S2). However, the growth rate is little slower than the parental cells.
In order to further confirm the flow cytometry results, we treated cells with PALA and total
cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-PARP and anti-caspase-3 using antibodies
specific for their cleaved forms. As shown in Fig. 2A–2E, PALA induced PARP and
caspase-3 degradation in cells lacking p53 or expressing mutant p53, and this process was
strongly inhibited in cells expressing dominant negative p73 or wild-type p53. Moreover,
ablation of p53 in cells expressing wild-type p53 rescued PALA-induced PARP and
caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 2D). These results also suggest that PALA-induced apoptosis is
mediated by TAp73 and that p53 protects cells from PALA-induced apoptosis.

We next examined whether PALA induced mitochondria-dependent or -independent
apoptosis by checking the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytoplasm.
Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions were separated as described previously (55). As
shown in Fig. 3A–C, treatment with PALA efficiently released cytochrome c into the
cytoplasm in cells lacking p53. In contrast, the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm
was inhibited in cells expressing dominant negative p73 or wild-type p53. The efficiency of
fractionation was confirmed by the lack of expression of COX4, a mitochondrial protein, in
the cytoplasmic fractions. This result suggests that PALA-induced apoptosis is mediated via
mitochondrial membrane depolarization and further confirms that p53 and TAp73 play

opposing roles in PALA-induced apoptosis: TAp73-mediates apoptosis, whereas p53
protects from apoptosis.
Activation of p53 and TAp73 by PALA

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since cells expressing dominant negative p73 or wild-type p53 are resistant to PALAinduced apoptosis, we next examined the expression of TAp73 using an antibody that
specifically detects all TA isoforms but not the ΔN isoforms (Materials and Methods) in
041, PC3, SKOV3 and their derivative cell lines. As shown in Fig. 4A–C, treatment with
PALA efficiently induced the expression of TAp73 protein. Expression of p53 had little
effect on TAp73 expression. In 041 and PC3 cells, PALA increased the TAp73 protein,
which has a molecular weight ~42kDa (corresponds to the molecular weight of TAp73δ). In
SKOV3 cells, the molecular weight of TAp73 induced by PALA was ~68kDa (corresponds
to the molecular weight of β-isoform). We next confirmed that the isoform induced in
SKOV3 cells was indeed TAp73β using an antibody that specifically detects the β-isoform
(Fig. 4C). We also examined the expression of ΔNp73 using an antibody that does not crossreact with TAp73 isoforms. All cells expressed ΔNp73, which was decreased after PALA
treatment in cells lacking p53; however, in cells expressing wild-type p53, the expression of
ΔNp73 was sustained (Fig. 4A–C). Moreover, PALA treatment efficiently induced the
expression of p53 (Fig. 4A, B and F). To confirm transcriptional activation of TAp73 and
p53, we measured p21 mRNA, a known transcriptional target of p53 family proteins by realtime PCR in 041, SKOV3 cells and their derivatives expressing p53 and dominant negative
p73. As shown in Fig. 4D, expression of p53 significantly increased the basal and PALAinduced level of p21. In contrast, expression of dominant negative p73 had an insignificant
effect on the basal level of p21. PALA treatment significantly increased the expression of
p21 in parental cells which was significantly inhibited after inactivation of p73 (Fig. 4D).
TAp73-dependent p21 expression was also confirmed in SKOV3 cells (Fig. 4E). We also
measured p21 expression in A549 cells transduced with shGFP and shp53 which suggested
that PALA induced p53-dependent expression of p21. Taken together, the results presented
in Fig. 4 thus suggest that PALA treatment activates both p53 and TAp73.
Differential regulation of PALA-induced Bim and Noxa expression by p53 and TAp73

Author Manuscript

The pro-apoptotic members of Bcl2 family that contain a BH3 domain play essential roles in
the regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in response to various forms of stress.
We have previously reported that Concanavalin A induced Bim in a p73-dependent manner
and that this process was inhibited after rescue of p53 function (12, 52). In order to
investigate the downstream target of TAp73 responsible for mediating PALA-induced
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, we next examined the expression of Bim and Noxa after
PALA treatment. As shown in Fig. 5A–C, PALA treatment efficiently induced the
expression of Bim and Noxa in all three cell lines lacking p53 and undergoing apoptosis. In
041 and SKOV3 cell lines, induction of the BimEL (23 kDa) isoform by PALA was more
pronounced than that of the BimL isoform. On the other hand, PC3 cells expressed a high
basal level of the BimEL isoform, which was slightly increased after PALA treatment (Fig.
5C). Increase in expression of the BimL (19 kDa) isoform by PALA was more predominant
in this cell line. The expression of BimS was very low in these cell lines and a long exposure
was required to detect it (data not shown). This result is consistent with a previous report

that the basal expression of different Bim isoforms varies with cell lines and that induction
of the BimL isoform is more predominant when the basal level of BimEL is high (49).
Moreover, it was previously shown that the BimL isoform is more potent in inducing
apoptosis, suggesting that induction of BimL in PC3 cells might induce apoptosis in this cell
line (48). Interestingly, expression of p53 in all three cell lines drastically inhibited the
expression of Bim and Noxa, suggesting a p53-dependent suppression of PALA-induced
Bim and Noxa expression. PALA also failed to increase Bim and Noxa in A549 cells which
is p53 wild-type (Figure 5C). Moreover, inactivation of TAp73 also inhibited the expression
of Bim and Noxa. To investigate whether the induction of Bim and Noxa by PALA occurred
at the transcriptional level, we measured the expression of Bim and Noxa mRNA after
PALA treatment in 041 and SKOV3 derivative cell lines by real time PCR (Fig. 5D–G). The
primer set used for Bim can detect all three isoforms of Bim. Treatment with PALA strongly
increased the level of Bim and Noxa mRNA in parental cells (more than 10-fold at 72 h). In
contrast, expression of p53 or inhibition of TAp73 significantly inhibited the induction of
Bim transcripts (Fig. 5D and E). PALA treatment also increased the level of Noxa
transcripts in parental cells, which was significantly inhibited by inactivation of TAp73 or
expression of p53 (Fig. 5F and G). These results suggest that, as for apoptosis, p53 and
TAp73 differentially regulate PALA-induced Bim and Noxa expression.
Role of Bim and Noxa in PALA-induced apoptosis

Author Manuscript

To investigate the role of Bim in PALA-induced apoptosis, we used shRNA to suppress Bim
expression in 041 and SKOV3 cells (Fig. 6A and D) and measured apoptosis in these cells.
Knockdown of Bim expression significantly inhibited PALA-induced apoptosis in both the
cell lines (Fig. 6B and E). Inhibition of PALA-induced apoptosis after ablation of Bim was
also supported by inhibition of PARP and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 6C and F). We also
knocked down the expression of Noxa in SKOV3 cells using an shNoxa plasmid
(SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, Frederick, MD) and two stable clones with ablated
Noxa expression were established by puromycin selection (Fig. 7A). Cells expressing
control siRNA or shNoxa were treated with PALA and apoptosis and release of cytochrome
c were examined. Treatment with PALA induced efficient apoptosis in cells transfected with
control siRNA, which was significantly decreased after knock down of Noxa expression
(Fig. 7B). Ablation of Noxa also inhibited the release of cytochrome c (Fig. 7C). These
results suggest that Noxa is also required for PALA-induced apoptosis.
Role of inhibition of Bcl-2 in PALA-induced apoptosis

Author Manuscript

Since it is the ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 that is critical for apoptosis, we
examined the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and mRNA and found that PALA
also inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 protein and transcripts in the parental cells lacking p53
(Fig. 8A and B). The inhibition of Bcl-2 was less prevalent in cells expressing p53 or
dominant negative p73. To assess the role of inhibition of Bcl-2 in PALA-induced apoptosis,
we overexpressed Bcl-2 in 041 cells, and measured apoptosis after treatment with PALA. As
shown in Fig. 8C, overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly inhibited PALA-induced apoptosis.
Cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 also demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited
PALA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8D). Taken together, our findings from Figs. 6–8 thus

suggest that PALA induces apoptosis of cells lacking functional p53 by modulating multiple
pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.
Discussion

Author Manuscript

PALA, a potent and reversible inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase, blocks de novo
pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, induces growth arrest of cells with p53, but kills cells
lacking p53 (35–40). Treatment of cells with PALA depletes the pyrimidine nucleotide pool
and thus exerts replicative stress, which rapidly activates p53, leading to reversible cellcycle arrest (56). In contrast, in the absence of p53, PALA treatment leads to DNA damage
(40) without cell-cycle arrest, cells continue DNA synthesis and are very likely to incur
more DNA damage. In cells where the degree of DNA damage is beyond the capacity for
repair, a signal (not known yet) is generated that leads to apoptosis. The properties of PALA
are ideal for an anti-tumor drug, because virtually all cancer cells have some disruption of
p53 function. Studies in cell culture and animal models revealed PALA to be highly
promising as an anti-tumor drug, and it has been tested in many clinical trials (57–59).
However, several important questions still remain unanswered: How is a halt in replication
linked to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis? What are the initiators of mitochondrial
depolarization? What happens to this signaling pathway in the presence of p53? The
findings presented in this manuscript have addressed these questions.

For the first time, we have shown that PALA-induced apoptosis is mediated by TAp73dependent expression of Noxa and Bim. We found that treatment of cells lacking functional
p53 with PALA activates TAp73, as evidenced by an increase in TAp73 expression, and
inhibition of PALA-induced p21 expression after inactivation of TAp73 using a dominant
negative construct. Moreover, inactivation of TAp73 significantly inhibited PALA-induced
apoptosis, suggesting that activation of TAp73 is required for PALA-induced apoptosis. We
also found that treatment of cancer cells lacking p53 with PALA increased the expression of
several pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bim and Noxa, and decreased the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. We also established that the expression of Bim and Noxa is
dependent on TAp73. The ratio of pro-apoptotic to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is highly
critical for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Our results also showed that PALA induced
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, ablation of the expression of Bim and Noxa or
overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly inhibited PALA-induced apoptosis. Taken together,
these data suggest that PALA-induced apoptosis is mediated by TAp73-dependent
expression of Bim and Noxa and involves the mitochondria-mediated pathway. Although
most cancers lack functional p53, they still respond to DNA damaging agents or
chemotherapy that induces DNA damage. An increasing body of evidence suggests that
activation of TAp73 plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis in these circumstances (60–
63). Moreover several studies suggest that Bim and Noxa cooperate to induce apoptosis (64–
66). Our findings are consistent with these observations that TAp73 mediates PALAinduced apoptosis by upregulating Bim and Noxa.
Interestingly, expression of p53 in cells lacking p53 inhibited the expression of both Noxa
and Bim, although the expression of p21 was increased. It was previously established that
the expression of p21 in these cells is dependent on p53 and is responsible for G1 cell cycle

arrest (36–39). However, in the absence of p21, PALA-induced p53-dependent S-phase
arrest without significant apoptosis (36, 37, 67). We have also reported that macrophage
inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1) mediates p53-dependent S phase arrest in response to PALA
(37). Although it was not clear how p53 inhibited the expression of Noxa and Bim after
PALA treatment, this might be due to rapid activation of p21 or other cell cycle regulatory
protein such as (MIC-1) and growth arrest in these cells. Since treatment of cells with PALA
induced limited DNA damage (68), sufficient to activate p53-dependent growth arrest, the
synthesis of other DNA is halted. On the other hand, since cells lacking p53 do not undergo
arrest, DNA damage accumulates through cell cycle progression, which later activates
TAp73 as reported previously for other DNA damaging agents (69, 70). Although it is not
clear from our study how PALA-induced p73 expression, it might be via a similar
mechanism (c-abl-dependent posttranslational modification) like other DNA-damaging
agents since PALA also induced DNA-damage (40, 68). It was also reported that
transcriptional repression of certain genes by p53 can also occur indirectly, through the
ability of p53 to transactivate p21 (71–73). Thus, p53-dependent p21 expression may also be
responsible for inhibition of Noxa and Bim in cells expressing p53. Studies also suggest that
upon DNA damage, ΔNp73 is rapidly degraded which facilitates apoptosis (74). Knock out
of ΔNp73 also increased the expression of p53 target genes and increased DNA damageinduced apoptosis (75). Since PALA induced severe DNA damage and degraded ΔNp73 in
cells lacking p53, but only minimal DNA damage in the presence of p53 where the
expression of ΔNp73 was also sustained, these events might also be responsible for the
inhibition of apoptosis and expression of Bim and Noxa in the presence of p53. However,
further studies are warranted to confirm how p53 suppresses the expression of Bim and
Noxa. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which PALA induces
the apoptosis of cancer cells lacking functional p53, which may be valuable for the further
development of PALA for cancer treatment.

Characteristics of the cell lines used in the study are presented in Table 1. MDAH041 (041)
is a Li-Fraumeni Syndrome cell line with no p53 (76). 041-p53 (C11) was derived from 041,
which expresses wild-type p53 and is arrested in S-phase upon PALA-treatment (36). 041ddp73 (C17) from 041, expresses T7-tagged dominant negative p73 (12). Expression of T7
was confirmed (supplementary Fig. S1A). PC3 (from ATCC; Bethesda, MD) is a prostate
cancer cell line lacking expression of p53. PC3-p53 was derived from PC3 expressing wildtype p53 (77). SKOV3 (from ATCC; Bethesda, MD), which lacks p53, is an ovarian cancer
cell line. SKp53 which express wild-type p53 were derived from SKOV3 and undergo Sphase arrest (37). C3 and C5 are two independent clones derived from SKOV3 expressing
dominant negative p73. SKOV3 cells were transfected with dominant negative p73 plasmid
which inactivates all the TAp73 isoforms (78). Expression of exogenous plasmid was
confirmed by immunoblotting with T7 (supplementary Fig. S1B). PCI-13, a head and neck

Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX), anti-Bim (which detects all Bim isoforms), antip73β (ab33131) and anti-ΔNp73 (ab11997) from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and anti-Noxa
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies that recognize cleaved PARP (Asp214,
catalog #9541) and caspase-3 (Asp175, catalog #9661) were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA). p73 siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA) and transfected into SKOV3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection
reagent.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay

Author Manuscript

For the apoptosis assay, cells were treated with PALA for the indicated times, fixed in 70%
ethanol and labeled with fluorescein-tagged bromo-dUTP and propidium iodide per the
manufacturer's protocol using the apoptosis kit (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA).
RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Amplification of the corresponding gene was performed using
primer sets supplied by Applied Biosystems, Inc. The data were analyzed for fold induction
of each gene compared with the untreated sample after normalization with β-actin
expression.
Western blotting analyses

Author Manuscript

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described elsewhere (12). Briefly, total
cellular proteins were isolated by lysing the cells in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% (w/v)
SDS, 2 mmol/L benzamidine, and 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein
concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Proteins were resolved on
SDS-10–12% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat skimmed milk and incubated with
the respective antibody, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody. Immunostained
protein bands were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Scientific).
