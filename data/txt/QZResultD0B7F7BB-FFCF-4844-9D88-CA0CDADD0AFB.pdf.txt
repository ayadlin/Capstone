BACKGROUND: FLT3–internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations are found in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). FLT3 inhibitors have shown clinical activity in AML with FLT3-ITD, but responses are usually short-lived. METHODS:
This study examined 69 FLT3-mutated patients with AML, who were treated with different FLT3 inhibitors to analyze emergence of
new mutations. RESULTS: At baseline, 87% of patients had an ITD mutation, 7% had a D835/I836 mutation, and 6% had combined
ITD and D835/I836 mutations. Responses occurred in 32% of patients, all with FLT3-ITD; none of the patients with D835/I836 or
ITD1D835/I836 responded. Mutational assessment at the time of FLT3 inhibitor discontinuation showed that 68% of patients were
unchanged, 10% had become undetectable, and 22% of patients progressed from a single ITD to have combined ITD1D835/I836
mutations. In those patients with unchanged FLT3 mutation at progression, the median survival was 5 months, whereas in those with
undetectable and with combined ITD1D835/I836 mutations, the median survival was 7 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These
data confirm in vitro observations that a secondary tyrosine kinase domain mutation may arise after the use of FLT3 inhibitors in
patients with single FLT3-ITD mutated AML, a phenomenon that is associated with resistance and a poor prognosis. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common acute leukemia in the United States,1 is a heterogeneous disease that
carries a variable prognosis based on pretreatment characteristics such as age, performance status, comorbid conditions,
prior cancer treatments, antecedent hematologic disorders, and cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities.2-5 The FLT3
gene is located on chromosome 13q12 and encodes the FLT3 tyrosine kinase receptor. FLT3 is 993 amino acids in length
and contains 5 extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, and 2
intracellular tyrosine kinase domains (TKDs) linked by a kinase-insert domain.6-9 Under normal circumstances, cytoplasmic FLT3 undergoes glycosylation, which promotes localization of the receptor to the membrane. Binding to
FLT3-ligand promotes receptor conformational changes and receptor homodimerization, which in turn promotes phosphorylation of the TKDs and activation of downstream effectors such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT),
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) and signal transducer and activator
of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathways.8 Activating mutations of FLT3 have been identified in patients with AML including internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the juxtamembrane region (head-to-tail duplication of 3-400 base pairs in
exons 14 or 15), TKD1, and mutations involving the D835/I836 residues and others of the TKD.8,10-12 They occur in
approximately 30% and 7% of patients with AML, respectively, and lead to constitutive activation of the TKD.10,11,13,14
Patients with AML with FLT3-ITD mutation typically present with a normal karyotype, elevated white blood cell
count, and higher percentages of blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The presence of FLT3 mutations has been
associated with a poor outcome, with a greater probability of relapse and shorter overall survival (OS).15-19 Several FLT3
inhibitors have been developed in an attempt to overcome this aggressive outcome of FLT3-ITD AML.20 Clinical

FLT3 Inhibitor Treatment in Mutated AML/Alvarado et al

responses have been observed with agents such as sorafenib,21 quizartinib,22 midostaurin,23 and others.
Responses are frequently characterized by a rapid reduction in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow blasts, but
they are usually transient with most patients eventually
progressing. Recently, it has been reported that point
mutations may confer in vitro resistance to FLT3
inhibitors.24,25
The frequency with which these mutations occur in
the clinic among patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors
and their clinical significance has not been fully described.
We thus analyzed our experience among patients with
AML with FLT3 mutations treated with various FLT3
inhibitors to define the frequency and clinical significance
of this phenomenon.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

We analyzed the records of 69 consecutive patients with
AML with FLT3 mutations treated at our institution in
clinical trials with different FLT3 inhibitors used as a
single agent from October 2002 to August 2011 and in
whom we obtained mutational assessment before and
after treatment. Patients were enrolled in studies 20090560 and 2006-0850 (AC220, quizartinib), 2004-0702
(sorafenib), 2003-0719 and ID02-274 (lestaurtinib,
CEP-701), and 2006-0275 (KW-2449). Studies were
approved by the institutional review board and conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients provided written informed consent before study
entry. Patients were also included in a retrospective chart
review approved by the institutional review board.
Patient Monitoring and Response Criteria

Patients were followed with complete blood counts at
least weekly during the first 4 weeks of therapy, then every
other week during the next 4 to 8 weeks, and then every 1
to 3 months based on response or clinical status. AML
response criteria followed the recommendations of the
International Working Group.26,27 Briefly, complete
remission (CR) was defined by the presence of < 5%
blasts in the bone marrow (BM) with > 1 3 109/L neutrophils and > 100 3 109/L platelets in the peripheral
blood. Morphologic complete remission with incomplete
platelet recovery (CRp), was defined in patients with CR
but persistent platelet count < 100 3 109/L. Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), was defined in patients with persistent
neutrophil count < 1 3 109/L, or without platelet recovery. Patients who showed a significant decrease (> 50%)

in bone marrow blast reduction (BMBR), without peripheral blood counts recovery are described separately. A
relapse was defined by > 5% blasts in a BM aspirate or by
the presence of extramedullary disease. Induction death
was defined as death that occurred within 6 weeks from
start of therapy.
Molecular Analysis for FLT3 Mutations

Genomic DNA extracted from fresh BM aspiration specimens using the Autopure extractor (QIAGEN/Gentra, Valencia, Calif) was used for mutation analysis. FLT3 (ITD
and D835) mutations were screened using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) followed by capillary electrophoresis on an
ABI-Prism 3100 or 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif), as described.28,29 To facilitate the
detection of PCR products by capillary electrophoresis, forward primers for ITD and D835 were labeled with a fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM). The presence of any
PCR fragment larger than the wild-type (WT) allele was
considered positive for ITD. For FLT3 codon 835 point
mutation analysis, PCR products were digested with EcoRV
before capillary electrophoresis. The WT allele cut by this
enzyme resulted in 2 fragments of 64 and 48 base pairs.29 In
contrast, mutations at D835 alter the EcoRV recognition site
and result in one 112 base-pair fragment. The sensitivity of
these assays is approximately 2%, that is, 1 mutated cell in
50 total cells, as established by dilution studies.
Statistical Methods

Patient characteristics are summarized using median
(range) for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. Categorical and continuous
variables were compared by using the Fisher exact test and
the Wilcoxon test, respectively.30 Event-free survival
(EFS) was calculated from the beginning of treatment
until an event, defined as relapse, resistance to induction
therapy, or death. Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated from the moment of CR until relapse or death in
CR. OS was calculated from the start of treatment until
death. Patients who remained alive at the last follow-up
were censored. The probabilities of OS and EFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method,31 and were compared among subgroups of patients using the log-rank
test.32 All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS,
version 9.0, software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

4 (6%) had a D835/I836 kinase domain mutation, and 5
(7%) had combined ITD and D835/I836 mutations
(Table 1). The median age for the 69 patients was 54 years
(range, 18-87 years), and the median number of prior leukemia treatments was 2 (range, 1-6), including 16 (23%)
patients with prior stem cell transplantation (SCT).
Karyotype was diploid in 24 (35%) patients; complex in
12 (17%) patients; 5 (7%) patients had either 27, 11q, or
18, miscellaneous in 11 (16%); and an additional
17 (25%) patients had either insufficient metaphases or
cytogenetics were not done at the time FLT3 inhibitor
therapy was started. Concomitant NPM1, RAS, and
CEBPA mutations were observed in 22%, 13%, and 4%
of the patients, respectively.
Survival Outcomes

Patients received therapy for a median of 78 days (range,
19-838 days). Forty-three (62%) patients did not achieve
response to therapy, and 4 (6%) patients died within 42
days after the start of therapy. Four (6%) patients achieved
CR, 9 (13%) patients achieved CRp, and 9 (13%) had a
significant BMBR from a median of 66% (range, 20-92)
blasts to a median of 5% (range, 2-26); notably, 3 of them
had documented BM blasts < 5% (ie, morphologic
leukemia-free state) but did not reach hematologic parameters for CR, CRp, or CRi. All responders had FLT3-ITD
alone. None of the patients with D835/I836, whether
alone or concomitant with FLT3-ITD achieved a response.
All patients eventually discontinued therapy. Among responders, 9 patients received stem cell transplantation
(CR 5 1, CRp 5 3, and BMBR 5 5), and 7 of them
relapsed with a median time to relapse after transplant of 4
months. Of note, only 2 patients (1 in CR and 1 in CRp)
had a negative FLT3-ITD by PCR prior to transplant.
Two patients who underwent transplantation in CRp
achieved CR after SCT and are the only 2 survivors,
2144

without relapse at the time of this analysis (3.5 and 5 years
after transplantation, respectively). Ten (14%) patients in
the nonresponse group received SCT, 6 immediately after
FLT3 inhibitor (median BM blast percentage at the time of
SCT 5 38%) and 4 after another salvage combination
chemotherapy (IA-sorafenib, FA-sorafenib, decitabine 1
gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and MEC, respectively). The
median time to progression after transplantation for these
10 patients was 2.3 months (range, 0-24 months). Among
patients who did not undergo transplantation, 4 (1 in CR,
1 in CRp, and 2 with BMBR) discontinued FLT3 inhibitor
due to toxicity and eventually progressed. All other patients
discontinued therapy because of progressive disease, and all
patients (except those 2 still alive) eventually progressed
with same malignant clone at presentation.
All patients had assessment of their FLT3 mutation
status at the time FLT3 inhibitor was discontinued. In 15
(22%) patients where a single FLT3-ITD mutation had
been identified at baseline, both FLT3-ITD and D835/
I836 mutations were identified at the end of therapy. In 7
(10%) patients (6 with FLT3-ITD at baseline and 1 with
D835/I836) no FLT3 mutation was identified at the time
treatment was discontinued. In all other 47 (68%)
patients, the mutation status was unchanged.
Patient characteristics of 15 patients developing a secondary FLT3 mutation are summarized in Table 2. Their
median age was 43 years, and median number of prior
treatments was 2, including 4 patients with prior SCT (one
of them with 2 prior transplants). The median duration of
treatment with FLT3 inhibitors was 126 days (range, 77570 days). Best response to therapy included no response in
7, significant BMBR in 3, CRp in 3, and CR in 2. We
include 2 patients in this group who received an SCT after
FLT3 inhibitor: one with no response but having lowburden disease (patient #9) and the other (patient #12) in
whom BM blast had decreased to 4%. In these 2 cases, the
D835/I836 mutation was detected at disease progression 2
and 3 months after transplantation, respectively.
Second-line FLT3 inhibitor treatment was
attempted in 7 of 15 patients with both FLT3-ITD and
D835/I836 mutations. None of the patients responded to
further therapy. In patients in whom FLT3 mutation was
unchanged or became negative, the median white blood
cell count (WBC), peripheral blood blasts (PBB), and
bone marrow blasts (BMB) at baseline were 5.5 3 109/L,
27%, 68.5%, and at the time of disease progression
2.6 3 109/L, 7.8%, 70%, respectively. In those who
developed both mutations, they were 7.8 3 109/L, 51%,
66% at baseline, and 20.5 3 109/L, 80%, and 74% at disease progression, respectively.

Figure 1. Survival curves are shown. (A) Overall survival from
beginning of treatment (median 5 6 months), (B) overall survival from FLT3 inhibitor treatment discontinuation (median 5
3 months), (C) survival of patients who underwent transplantation (median 5 7 months), (D) survival of patients with
undetectable mutation after treatment (median 5 7 months),
(E) survival of patients with unchanged mutation status
(median 5 5 months), and (F) survival of patients developing
both mutations (median 5 7 months).

At the time of this analysis, 67 (97%) patients had
died. The median survival in the entire group from the
time the FLT3 inhibitor was started was 6 months. In the
subgroup analysis, those patients in whom the FLT3
mutation became negative had median survival of 7
months, compared to 5 months for those with no change
in mutation status and 7 months in those with ITDD835/I836 mutations. The median survival for patients
who underwent transplantation was 7 months and the
median survival from time of treatment discontinuation
in the entire group was 3 months (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
It has been established that FLT3-ITD–mutated, normal
karyotype AML carries a poor prognosis. Although several
2146

multivariate analyses have failed to establish a direct
impact in the ability to achieve a complete remission, they
have proved a strong correlation with an increased risk of
relapsed and poor OS.10,11,13-17,19,33 Therefore, it is generally accepted that these patients should undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first remission if
feasible. However, the outcome of these patients is also inferior after allogeneic stem cell transplantation compared
to comparable patients with no FLT3 mutation. In one
recent report of patients who underwent transplantation
in first remission, the 2-year relapse rate was 30% versus
16% for those with no FLT3-ITD, and the leukemia-free
survival probability was lower (58% versus 71%).34 Thus,
there is a need to investigate new treatment options for
these patients. Among them, FLT3 inhibitors have
emerged in recent years as promising additions to the
treatment armamentarium that may improve the outcome
of these patients.20
Several inhibitors of FLT3 kinase activity have
entered the clinical development arena. Sorafenib has
shown inhibition of the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in ITD mutants in vitro using primary human
AML cells and in an animal model.35 A phase 1 study
conducted in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) and relapsed or refractory AML showed CR or
CRp in 10% of patients; significant reduction in BM
and/or peripheral blood blasts was seen in an additional
34% patients (all responses in patients with FLT3-ITD
mutation).21 Activity of midostaurin (PKC412) was
reported in a phase 2B trial with 95 patients with AML
or MDS, with either wild-type (n 5 60) or mutated
(n 5 35) FLT3; one patient achieved partial response
(PR), and reduction in peripheral blood or BM blasts of
at least 50% was observed in 71% of patients with FLT3mutant and 42% of patients with FLT3 wild-type.23
Quizartinib (AC220) is a second-generation FLT3 inhibitor with greater kinase selectivity.36 In a phase 1
study, 76 patients with relapsed refractory AML, regardless of FLT3-ITD mutation status, received quizartinib
at escalating doses. Of 17 patients with FLT3-ITD
mutation, 53% responded, and among 37 patients without the mutation, 14% responded. There were 22
patients with FLT3-ITD status of indeterminate or not
tested, and among them, 41% responded. The median
duration of response was 13 weeks; median survival was
14 weeks.37 Earlier inhibitors such as lestaurtinib inhibited multiple kinases and produced mostly partial
responses.38 Despite this promising clinical activity,
responses are usually transient and insufficient to induce
a durable response.39,40

FLT3 Inhibitor Treatment in Mutated AML/Alvarado et al

The current cohort of patients, treated with a variety
of inhibitors, followed the same pattern as reported in
these studies; several patients achieved responses, with
many of them able to be bridged to transplantation, but
in all instances (except occasionally when patients underwent transplantation) the responses were eventually lost.
Many of these patients were treated during a time when
the allelic burden was not routinely measured, but it has
been suggested that patients with relapsed disease carry a
greater allelic burden than untreated patients and their
disease depends more on the aberrant FLT3 signaling, a
phenomena that could explain the greater cytotoxicity
observed with more specific FLT3 inhibitors.41 Interestingly, in a subset of patients, the mutated clone was no
longer detectable upon progression. This subset of
patients carried a similar median survival when compared
with the group developing the second mutation, but disease burden and proliferation seem to be increased in the
later. Undoubtedly, this is a small cohort and a retrospective analysis, making these observations only preliminary,
but if these observations can be confirmed in larger, prospective series, this might identify a subset of patients
whose biology is changed by the introduction of FLT3
inhibitors, perhaps favoring the emergence of clones that
are more proliferative and no longer inhibited by FLT3
inhibitors that have lesser (eg, quizartinib) or no (eg, sorafenib) activity against unmutated FLT3. It is also entirely
possible that the FLT3 mutated clone is present, only
below the level of detection of our assay. Still, this would
suggest that another clone has become more prominent.
Ongoing studies are testing these hypotheses.
Resistance to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibition occurs
eventually in virtually all patients and has been attributed
to compensatory activation of downstream effectors such
as STAT5 or MAPK despite complete inhibition of FLT3
tyrosine phosphorylation.42-44 Other mechanisms of resistance include upregulation of FLT3 ligand and FLT3
receptor or upregulation of antiapoptotic genes and
downregulation of proapoptotic signals, or compensatory
activation of secondary signaling pathways such as Ras or
PI3K.45-49 Recently, a novel FLT3-ITD mutation located
in the nonjuxtamembrane domains of FLT3
(FLT3_ITD627E) mediated constitutive phosphorylation of FLT3 and of STAT5, and induced transformation
of hematopoietic 32D cells, leading to a lethal myeloproliferative disease in a syngeneic mouse model.12 Upon further characterization, authors also suggested that
(FLT3_ITD627E) induces dramatic upregulation of the
antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 protein (MCL-1),
an effect that appeared to be due to an enhanced and
Cancer

July 15, 2014

sustained binding of the adaptor protein GRB-2 to the
FLT3_ITD627E receptor, which was independent from
the inhibitor midostaurin-induced inhibition of the receptor kinase.44 Sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors seems to be
variable in different mutants,35,50,51 and in vitro exposure
to different FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been associated with development of secondary FLT3-resistant
mutations, which interestingly were not overlapping, as
was the case of Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib).52 More recently, Smith et al24 reported
the emergence of resistance mutations in cells from 8
patients treated with AC220 (quizartinib). D835Y (an
activation loop mutation) and F691L (a gatekeeper mutation) were each detected in 3 instances, with 2 others
showing D835V.
Our results confirm the emergence of secondary
TKD mutations—in our series specifically, D835/I836—
as a common mechanism of resistance after treatment
with FLT3 inhibitors in patients with FLT3-ITD AML
occurring in approximately 20% of patients. To our
knowledge, this is the first report to analyze the development of these mutations while on therapy with FLT3
inhibitors. De novo FLT3-TKD mutations are also associated with normal karyotype AML and higher blast percentage, but whereas several groups have noted a strong
association with worse DFS and OS,14,15,53 others noted
no significant prognostic impact.11,54,55 Recently, Bacher
et al56 characterized the mutational status of 3082 patients
with newly diagnosed AML; unlike FLT3-ITD, FLT3TKD did not influence prognosis, however, authors
found an unfavorable prognosis in patients harboring
double mutations, including those with both FLT3-ITD
and TKD. In our series, none of the patients expressing
TKD mutations, whether alone or in combination with
ITD, responded to FLT3 inhibitors. The emergence of resistant clones with this or other mutations that are resistant to agents being used to treat the patient would likely
alter the patient outcome. New agents such as crenolanib57 and PLX339758 are being developed that may overcome these resistant mutations.
Our series represents a retrospective analysis of
patients treated with a variety of inhibitors. It is possible
that the rate and type of mutations will vary clinically
depending on the inhibitor being used, as has been
described in the laboratory.52 Importantly, we did not
look for other mutations that have been described as
mechanisms of resistance of FLT3 inhibitors, eg, N676K
mutation as reported by Heidel et al.25 Thus, it is likely
that the incidence of resistant mutations is higher than
that reported here.

Original Article

We conclude that emergence of resistant mutations
is a common mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors
used clinically, with such mutations emerging in at least
20% of patients. This shows that in these cases, survival of
AML blasts depends to a great extent on FLT3 signaling.
Patients treated with these agents need to be assessed for
emergence of these mutations, and new agents that may
overcome or, ideally, prevent the emergence of such mutations need to be developed.
