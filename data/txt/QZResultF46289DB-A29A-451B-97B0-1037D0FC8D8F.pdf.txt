Abstract

Author Manuscript

Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate (MARCKS), a substrate of protein kinase C, is a
key regulatory molecule controlling mucus granule secretion by airway epithelial cells as well as
directed migration of leukocytes, stem cells and fibroblasts. Phosphorylation of MARKCS may be
involved in these responses. However, the functionality of MARCKS and its related
phosphorylation in lung cancer malignancy have not been characterized. This study demonstrated
elevated levels of MARCKS and phospho-MARCKS in highly invasive lung cancer cell lines and
lung cancer specimens from non-small-cell lung cancer patients. siRNA knockdown of MARCKS
expression in these highly invasive lung cancer cell lines reduced cell migration and suppressed
PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase)/Akt phosphorylation and Slug level. Interestingly, treatment
with a peptide identical to the MARCKS N-terminus sequence (the MANS peptide) impaired cell
migration in vitro and also the metastatic potential of invasive lung cancer cells in vivo.
Mechanistically, MANS peptide treatment resulted in a coordination of increase of E-cadherin
expression, suppression of MARCKS phosphorylation and AKT/Slug signalling pathway but not
the expression of total MARCKS. These results indicate a crucial role for MARCKS, specifically
its phosphorylated form, in potentiating lung cancer cell migration/metastasis and suggest a
potential use of MARCKS-related peptides in the treatment of lung cancer metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Metastasis is the characteristic that distinguishes benign from malignant tumors. Metastatic
spread of solid tumors makes many cancers incurable from surgical resection and in many
cases resistant to treatment from radiation and/or chemotherapy. To ultimately improve
cancer treatment and survival, inhibition of the metastatic process must be a major part of
any drug development and targeting.1 For many years, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition
was considered a strong molecular candidate for targeting in cancer therapy due to its
increased activation in many cancers.2 However, the diverse signalling effects of PKCs
along with their large number of isoforms has made drug development difficult for these
enzymes.3 Accordingly, one consideration is to narrow the inhibition to downstream
mediators of PKCs that have more focused mechanisms of action and differential activation
in cancers vs normal tissues. One substrate of PKCs, Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase
Substrate (MARCKS), could be an intriguing target for inhibition in cancer therapy.

MARCKS, originally identified as a major target of PKC phosphorylation, is tethered to the
plasma membrane through its myristyl group along with ionic interactions between the
membrane phospholipids and the MARCKS effector domain.4 Phosphorylation of
MARCKS by PKCs leads to its shuttling from the plasma membrane to the cytosol where it
has roles in cell migration through actin cytoskeletal remodelling and regulation of exocytic
vesicle release in secretory cells, such as neurons and airway goblet cells.5–7 In addition to
PKCs, phosphorylation of MARCKS in certain tissues is regulated by other kinases such as
rho or mitogen-activated protein kinases.8–10 Particularly, serine 159 in MARCKS may be
an important phosphorylation site, because it can be phosphorylated by both PKCs and Rho
kinases (ROCK).9,10 Activation of ROCK have been linked to metastasis and their
inhibition by ROCK inhibitors has shown promise in cancer therapy.11–13 However, whether
ROCK inhibitors alter metastasis through MARCKS phosphorylation is unclear.

Author Manuscript

There have been limited studies on MARCKS in cancer metastasis, but the results have been
conflicting. In cholangiocarcinoma and leukemia cells, MARCKS has been associated with
invasion.14,15 In contrast, MARCKS phosphorylation seems to inhibit bladder cancer
invasiveness.16 Inactivating mutations of MARCKS is known to be implicated with
intestinal adenocarcinoma formation.17 Interestingly, MARCKS has been reported to be not
only pro-metastatic18,19 but also a growth suppressor20,21 in glioma and melanoma cells. In
particular, there have thus far been no studies on MARCKS in lung cancer. In the lungs,
MARCKs has been extensively studied because of its role in regulating mucous granule
exocytosis. A pharmacological inhibitor of MARCKS signalling, termed MANS peptide,
has been developed and tested in asthma models.22 Inhibition of MARCKS with MANS
peptide can reduce airway mucus hypersecretion both in vitro and in vivo.7,22 Inflammatory
leukocyte migration and degranulation have more recently also been found to be capable of
being inhibited by MANS peptide.23,24 Despite these findings showing the feasibility of
physiological inhibition of MARCKS, MANS peptide has not been studied on lung cancer
cells to determine whether MARCKS can be a therapeutic target for inhibiting metastasis.
In this report, three aims were defined: (1) to determine whether invasive lung cancer cell’s
migratory properties are due to MARCKS and its associated phosphorylation; (2) to test

whether pharmacological inhibition of MARCKS by the MANS peptide can be used to
inhibit metastatic properties in highly invasive lung cancer cells; and (3) to determine
whether MARCKS signalling may demonstrate some crosstalk with other pathways that
affect cancer cell metastasis, such as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Collectively, our studies point to a promoting role of MARCKS, especially phosphoMARCKS, in lung cancer metastasis, and also identify MANS peptide as a novel
pharmacological inhibitor of MARCKS function in lung cancer.

RESULTS
MARCKS expression and phosphorylation are associated with lung cancer cell migration

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To identify novel genes associated with metastasis, we performed RNA-seq on two cell lines
derived from the same patient: the non-metastatic CL1-0 parent line and the highly invasive
and metastatic CL1-5 subpopulation.25 MARCKS mRNA expression appeared to be highly
elevated in the CL1-5 cells vs the CL1-0 cells. To confirm this, we performed quantitative
real-time reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR) on MARCKS mRNA expression in CL1-0,
CL1-5 and three other invasive (CL1-0/F3, A549, PC9) and one non-invasive (NCI-H292)
cell lines (Figure 1a, top). The relative invasive and migratory potential of these cells were
confirmed by matrigel invasion and transwell migration assays, respectively (Figure 1b, top
and bottom). MARCKS expression is low in CL1-0 and NCI-H292 (Figure 1a), which also
shows low invasive and migratory potential (Figure 1b). In contrast, cells with high
migratory and invasive potential, such as A549, PC9, CL1-0/F3 and CL1-5, also showed
higher MARCKS expression. However, activated MARCKS requires phosphorylation at
serine 159/163 for its translocation to the cytosol to interact with and remodel the actin
cytoskeleton, so we also looked at the levels of phospho-MARCKS. Consistent with the
above data, phospho-MARCKS levels also correlated with the cell’s invasive and migratory
potential (Figure 1a, bottom). Similarly, higher levels of MARCKS phosphorylation were
found in an H441/F3 motile subpopulation compared with the less-motile H441 parental
cells (Supplementary Figure S1). These data strongly suggest that increased MARCKS
signalling events are important determinants of increased invasive and migratory ability of
cancer cell populations.

MARCKS is known to be a major substrate of PKCs. To confirm whether MARCKS
phosphorylation is regulated by PKCs in our cell lines, we examined the level of MARCKS
phosphorylation in cells treated with the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13acetate (TPA). As shown in Figure 1c, Ser159/163 phosphorylation of MARCKS is
increased upon TPA stimulation in numerous lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. However,
ROCK have also been shown to phosphorylate MARCKS at serine 159, and TPA has been
reported to also stimulate ROCK.25 To determine whether the high levels of basal
MARCKS phosphorylation noted in the invasive cancer cell lines CL1-5, A549 and PC9,
were due to PKC or ROCK activation, Calphostin C, a potent PKC inhibitor, at 250 nM, and
Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor, at 10 µM, were used to treat these cells for 2 h. Western blot
analysis demonstrated that both inhibitors decreased basal phosphorylation of Ser159/163 of
MARCKS in all of these cells, and there was an additive inhibition when both inhibitors
were used (Figure 1d). These results suggest that the high basal Ser159/163 phosphorylation

of MARCKS in invasive lung cancer cell lines is due to combined contributions from both
PKC and ROCK activation. Thus, activated MARCKS may be a key mediator of the
increased motility and metastatic potential of cancer cells attributed to the activation of
PKCs and ROCK.2,11–13,26–28
Elevated phospho-MARCKS in lung cancer specimens

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the clinical significance of MARCKS phosphorylation, 18 primary cancer
specimens of histologically confirmed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were studied.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of MARCKS phosphorylation showed that
significantly higher intensity and number of cells stained in the tumor vs adjacent non-tumor
tissue sections in 14/18 patients. Figure 2a shows representative pictures in 3 of the 14
patients demonstrating this differential IHC staining. In addition, we also found that higher
levels of MARCKS phosphorylation occurred in adenocarcinoma vs other histological types
of NSCLC at 50% vs 33%, respectively (Figures 2b and c). MARCKS phosphorylation was
expressed much higher in NSCLCs with a poorly differentiated histotype (67%) and
significantly correlated with differentiated status (P = 0.021; Fisher’s exact test). These
observations in primary lung cancer specimens support an association between MARCKS
phosphorylation and a more aggressive lung cancer histological grade.
MARCKS is a potential oncogene in lung cancer

We next investigated potential mechanisms by which MARCKS could affect migration of
NSCLC cells. We used the pooling of four different siRNA sequences to silence endogenous
MARCKS expression in the highly MARCKS-expressing cell lines, CL1-0/F3, CL1-5 and
PC9. Wound-healing assays demonstrated a 70% reduction in migration of MARCKS
knockdown cells compared with native control (Figures 3a–c). Consistently, transwell
migration ability of PC9 cells was also decreased after silencing MARCKS expression
(Figure 3d, top). To observe whether this also reduced invasive potential, we further tested
PC9 cells in matrigel invasion assays, and this also showed that MARCKS knockdown
could reduce its invasion (Figure 3d, bottom). One of MARCKS’ functions is to sequester
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and PIP2 is a component of
phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. Moreover, it has been reported that
MARCKS expression is associated with the PI3K/AKT pathway in glioma cells.20 In
addition, the EMT transcriptional repressor Slug is known to be an important metastasis
enhancer in lung cancer29 and acts downstream of AKT signalling.30,31 Therefore, we
hypothesized that there could be a relationship between MARCKS and the AKT/Slug
pathway. Our results showed that PI3K and AKT phosphorylation, as well as Slug
expression levels, were reduced by siRNA silencing of MARCKS expression (Figure 3e).
This indicates that MARCKS functions in PI3K/AKT signaling to alter expression of prometastatic genes, such as Slug.
The MANS peptide inhibits migration and invasion of lung cancer cells in vitro
Previously, an N-terminal fragment of MARCKS termed MANS peptide has been shown to
inhibit MARCKS signaling and mucin secretion in normal humn bronchial epithelial
(NHBE) cells without causing cytotoxicity.7,22 We confirmed this lack of toxicity by

treating lung cancer cells with the MANS peptide at concentrations up to 100 µM and noted
similar viability to that observed in untreated or the control, RNS peptide-treated cells
(Supplementary Figure S2). Treatment of the invasive cell lines CL1-0/F3, CL1-5 and PC9
with MANS at 100 µM impaired cell motility, as observed in wound-healing assays at 12 and
24 h post scratch (Figures 4a and b), as well as in transwell migration assays (Figure 4c). A
similar suppression on cell invasive ability in matrigel-coated transwell was seen in these
cells after MANS peptide treatment, whereas no suppression was seen with the control RNS
peptide treatment (Figure 4d). These results demonstrate that MANS peptide has antimotility and anti-invasive effects on lung cancer cells without causing toxicity to normal
cells.
The MANS peptide inhibits lung cancer metastasis in vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine whether the MANS peptide inhibits metastatic activities in vivo, a
subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografts model were used. In the first model, subcutaneously
grown tumors from PC9 cells were assessed for lung micrometastasis at day 32. These mice
were split into three groups that received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; control), PBS
with 50 nmol RNS or MANS peptide every 2 days. As shown in Figure 5a, Hematoxylin
and eosin staining revealed that the lungs of mice receiving PBS or RNS peptide treatment
contained significantly more micrometastatic lesions than those treated with MANS peptide.
To strengthen this finding, we used another metastasis model more specific for lung cancer
by using orthotopic lung injections. In this model, after pretreatment with PBS, RNS or
MANS peptide for 4 h, PC9 cells were injected percutaneously into the left lung of NOD/
SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice. After 7 days, these mice were given
additional treatment with PBS, RNS and MANS at 50 nmol per intraperitoneal injection
every 3 days. At day 25 (six injections), mice were killed, and the number of metastasized
tumor nodules in the contralateral lung and other organs was counted. The MANS-treated
group showed no difference in average size of the tumor at the site of injection, suggesting
that MANS treatment does not affect tumorigenesis. However, a significant decrease of
metastastic nodules was noted in the contralateral lung and other organs compared with the
PBS- or RNS-treated groups (Figures 5b and c); in fact, treatment with the MANS peptide
essentially blocked totally all metastasis from the tumor to other lung sites as well as to
other organs. Similarly, we also found an inhibitory effect of MANS peptide on CL1-5 cell’s
metastasis (Supplementary Figure S3). These in vivo results are consistent with the above in
vitro findings and support the notion that inhibition of MARCKS function by the MANS
peptide can reduce the metastatic spread of lung cancer in vivo.

MANS peptide suppresses cell spreading and increases epithelial cell–cell contacts with
upregulation of E-cadherin
To further elucidate the MANS peptide effects, we noticed a change of fibroblastic
morphology to a more epithelial cobblestone-like appearance at the edge of scratch in these
lung cancer cultures after MANS peptide treatment, while no change in the appearance was
observed after the control RNS peptide treatment (Figure 6a, top). To evaluate F-actin at the
cell edges of the scratch, phalloidin staining was carried out. We noticed that the extent of
cell spreading and surface protrusions was reduced in MANS peptide-treated cultures,
suggesting an inhibition of filopodia and lamellopodia formation (Figure 6a, bottom). To

determine effects on cell spreading, a cell-scattering assay was performed. Cell colonies
incubated with the MANS peptide were more compact and exhibited more cell-to-cell
adhesion than control or RNS peptide-treated colonies (Figure 6b). Consistent with the
morphological observation, immunofluorescent staining has shown an increase of Ecadherin’s presence in the periphery of MANS-treated cells (Figure 6c). Western blot
analyses of expression of E-cadherin, a major adhesion molecule in epithelial cell junctions,
revealed elevated E-cadherin levels in cultures treated with the MANS peptide but not in
cultures treated with the control RNS peptide, and this increase appeared to be concentration
dependent (Figure 6d). Interestingly, un-parallel with this elevation, Slug level was
suppressed in cells treated with MANS peptide.
The MANS peptide suppresses MARCKS phosphorylation and PI3K/AKT signalling

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Although the MANS peptide has been shown before to inhibit MARCKS function, it is not
clear whether it alters MARCKS phosphorylation in cells. To explore this possibility, lung
cancer cell lines CL1-0/F3, CL1-5, PC9 and A549 with high phospho-MARCKS expression
(see Figure 1) were treated with MANS or the control RNS peptide. As shown in Figure 7a,
treatment with the MANS peptide suppressed levels of phospho-MARCKS (but not the total
MARCKS) in these cell lines. To our surprise, a similar inhibition was seen in primary
normal NHBE cells after TPA treatment, which induced phospho-MARCKS formation from
a low basal level, but the enhancement was suppressed by the MANS peptide (Figure 7b).
Again, there was no effect of the MANS peptide on total MARCKS levels. As PI3K/AKT
signalling is involved in EMT and Slug level, we carried out western blot analyses of
PI3K/AKT phosphorylation and Slug expression in these cells after treatment with MANS.
As shown in Figure 7c and Supplementary Figure S4, the MANS peptide was able to
suppress phosphorylation of these signalling molecules as well as decrease levels of Slug in
these invasive cells. These results suggest that MARCKS, especially its phosphorylated
form, has a coordinating role upstream of signaling events associated with the AKT/Slug
pathway, which may, in turn, affect cell migration and lung cancer invasiveness.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

The results of this study have identified a novel mechanism to inhibit lung cancer cell
migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Initially, we found an elevation in expression of
MARCKS protein and its phosphorylation in several lung cancer cell lines with high
metastatic potential, compared with less invasive lung cancer cell lines and normal NHBE
cells. Significantly elevated phospho-MARCKS was also demonstrated IHC in tissue
sections from lung cancer patients but not in adjacent non-cancer areas. Using the MANS
peptide to pharmacologically inhibit MARCKS phosphorylation and function, lung cancer
cell lines showed reduced migration and in vivo metastasis. This effect could be further
verified to be due to MARCKS, as siRNA knockdown of MARCKS also reduced migration
characteristics of lung cancer cells. In addition, we have identified a potential additional
mechanism for MARCKS signalling where it is associated with PI3 kinase/AKT pathways
to alter epithelial characteristics in invasive lung cancer cells. Collectively, these findings
suggest that the MANS peptide inhibits MARCKS phosphorylation, which then results in

reduced signalling to the AKT/Slug axis, which, in turn, ultimately reduces migration,
invasiveness and metastasis of lung cancer cells (Figure 7d).

Author Manuscript

MARCKS has been reported to have an important role in several lung diseases.7,22–24 Here,
we reveal a novel function for MARCKS in possibly potentiating human lung cancer cell
malignancy. First, inhibitor studies demonstrated that PKC and/or ROCK activation
contribute to an increase of MARCKS phosphorylation in invasive lung cancer cells,
suggesting that at least Ser159 phosphorylation of MARCKS could be a convergence
between PKC and ROCK signalling in lung cancer. The other phosphorylation site on
MARCKS at Ser163, which is phosphorylated only by PKC, may not be involved here as it
would not be phosphorylated by ROCK.9–10 Indeed, studies of lung cancer specimens from
NSCLC patients confirmed the clinical significance of MARCKS phosphorylation
(phospho-Ser159), and, importantly, we showed that reduced invasiveness of lung cancer
cells appeared due to the MANS peptide’s ability to block phosphorylation of the MARCKS
at the Ser159 site. Phosphorylation at this site is necessary for MARCKS to shift from its
location on the inner face of the plasma membrane into the cytosol, where it can alter F-actin
crosslinking that ultimately can affect cell spreading and migration.5 This loss of
phosphorylation of MARCKS induced by the MANS peptide was correlated with increased
cell-to-cell contact along with increased expression of E-cadherin and reduced expression of
Slug. This suggests that inhibiting MARCKS phosphorylation can prevent the loss of cellto-cell adhesion and decrease in migratory potential seen in many invasive cancers that
ultimately lead to less metastasis. In addition, MANS peptide also reduced PI3K and AKT
phosphorylation, suggesting that MARCKS is functioned in this pathway that may
ultimately lead to downstream changes in Slug and E-cadherin expression levels to alter
EMT characteristics of cancer cells. One study in glioma cells shows that MARCKS inhibits
AKT activation,20 but this is likely due to intrinsic differences in the tissue origin and
phenotype of the cancer cells. For instance, AKT has been reported to be highly expressed in
the lung but less expressed in the brain.32 Basing on the findings that loss of phosphatase
and tensin homolog and overexpression of AKT frequently occur in lung cancer cells,32,33
we considered that PIP3 pool may be favorable to bind to AKT and then promotes AKT
activation in lung cancer after sequestration of PIP2 by MARCKS. Conversely, the binding
of PIP3 to phosphatase and tensin homolog may be increased to produce PIP2 in glioma
cells, leading to inactivation of AKT. Further experiments are needed to discern the
difference.

Author Manuscript

As MARCKS localized to the plasma membrane is able to sequester PIP2 via electrostatic
interactions,34 it is possible that MARCKS may be a potential regulator of the switch
between PIP2 and PIP3, depending on MARCKS associations within or outside of the
membrane. MARCKS tethers to the plasma membrane via its N-terminal myristyl group and
also affects lipid rafts in the membrane.35–37 Based on the theory proposed by Kalwa and
Michel,37 it is reasonable that MARCKS recruits PIP2 and facilitates accumulation of PIP2
levels in lipid raft. Following phosphorylation, MARCKS detaches from the membrane and
releases PIP2 pool, which becomes available to PI3K to produce PIP3. Such a two-step
contribution of MARCKS may explain why the availability of PIP2 is adversely affected
both by siRNA knockdown of MARCKS (Figure 3) and by MANS-mediated inhibition of
MARCKS phosphorylation (Figure 7). Though MANS peptide has been reported to inhibit

MARCKS membrane targeting,24 there is a theoretical possibility that MANS may act not
just by excluding MARCKS from certain protein complexes but also by sequestering the
proteins that naturally interact with MARCKS. Consequently, loss of the functions of these
proteins may contribute to suppression of cancer metastasis. Using MANS peptide to
interfere protein complex formations or to antagonize the functions of MARCKS-associated
proteins may provide new insights into anticancer therapy.

Cancer metastasis is a complex process, and many steps are involved in the spreading of the
cells from the primary tumor to distant sites. This multiple-step process is, for the most part,
associated with increased cell spreading and motility, which depend critically on dynamic
reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.1,38,39 MARCKS has long been known to participate
in cell migration and regulate actin cytoskeleton remodelling.24,36,40,41 Recently, the role of
MARCKS in promoting colon cancer metastasis has been confirmed by Rombouts et al.,42
so it is logical that its inhibition may alter cancer cell migration and metastasis. Indeed, our
results here show that MANS peptide could not only repress cancer cell migration/
metastasis but also suppress the expression of the EMT regulator, Slug, which is known to
be a downstream target of AKT30,31,43 and an important prognostic indicator in lung
cancer.44 Correspondingly, increase in the epithelial marker E-cadherin occurs during
MARCKS inhibition. These correlated results may suggest an interactively direct or a
parallel consequence of MARCKS inhibition by MANS peptide on migration/invasion and
PI3K/AKT pathway. Altogether, these results suggest that MANS’ effects may be more
complicated than direct actin cytoskeletal remodelling and may include regulating other
signalling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and EMT, which also have roles in cancer
metastasis. In addition to invasion and migration, metastasis is known to be influenced by
complex number of factors, including angiogenesis, inflammatory microenvironment,
immune evasion, survival in the circulation and metastatic colonization. It is not clear
whether these factors could also be affected by MANS peptide, and future studies should be
able to delineate if MANS peptide can alter any of these other properties of cancer
metastasis.

Although MANS peptide has been used before pharmacologically to inhibit MARCKS in
the airways to reduce mucous hypersecretion in animal models of inflammatory lung
disease,22 this is, to our knowledge, the first report where this peptide could be used as an
effective treatment in lung cancer by preventing cancer cell migration and metastasis.
Previously, the MANS peptide was reported to be efficacious in its inhibition of mucus
secretion via its inhibition of MARCKS’ association with membranes of intracellular mucus
granules.24 We show here that another novel pharmacological function of MANS peptide is
its ability to reduce the phosphorylation of MARCKS at serine 159. Although further studies
will be needed to determine the mechanism(s) of how the MANS peptide can inhibit serine
159 phosphorylation, we hypothesize that the MANS peptide, which may act as a
competitive inhibitor, may repress the binding of endogenous PKC and/or ROCK with
MARCKS and prevent its phosphorylation. Consistent with this notion, we have shown that
MANS peptide can also suppress TPA-induced phospho-MARCKS expression in primary
NHBE cells (Figure 7b). These observations indicate that the MANS peptide could

specifically target cells with high level of MARCKS phosphorylation, including malignant
lung cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

Cancer treatments from conventional chemotherapy drugs have always been problematic
because of their toxicity to normal cells. Because our results show significant differences in
MARCKS phosphorylation between normal vs cancer cells, the fact that the MANS peptide
can inhibit MARCKS phosphorylation suggest that it may have a more selective action on
cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Indeed, the narrower spectrum of its inhibitory
activity on cellular migration, rather than activating apoptotic pathways, suggest it will have
reduced cytotoxicity compared with PKC inhibitors or conventional chemotherapeutic
drugs.45,46 The relatively good safety profile demonstrated here in our in vitro NHBE cells
as well as in our in vivo mouse studies suggests that MANS or a similar peptide that blocks
MARCKS phosphorylation could be further tested in clinical trials as an adjuvant to surgery,
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for lung cancer.
In summary, our studies here show a novel role for MARCKS, specifically its
phosphorylation (Ser159), in potentiating lung cancer cell migration and malignancy.
Importantly, we also reveal that a truncated N-terminal portion of MARCKS, termed the
MANS peptide, antagonizes the functions of MARCKS, apparently via reducing
phosphorylation of MARCKS and of the AKT/Slug axis. The results here form the basis for
future studies that can elucidate in more detail exactly how MARCKS is involved in cancer
cell migration and whether its inhibition by MANS and MANS-related peptides can be used
in clinical settings to treat lung cancer.

All reagents and antibodies used in this study are described in the Supplementary
Information and Supplementary Methods.
Cell culture and transfection

Author Manuscript

The CL1-0 and CL1-5 were established as previously described.47 The CL1-0/F3 and
H441/F3, respectively, are derived from CL1-0 and H441 through progressive isolation and
expansion of cells that pass through an 8-µM Transwell membrane (without overlay of
matrigel) similar to previous methods.25 The cell lines PC9, A549, and NCI-H292 cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillinstreptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For siRNAs transfection,
ON-TARGETplus MARCKS siRNA and scrambled siRNA sequences (Thermo Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA) were transfected using DharmaFECT (Thermo Scientific Inc.)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

as the reference gene in real-time RT-PCR assay. The relative expression level of MARCKS
compared with that of ACTB was defined as −ΔCT = −(CTtarget − CTACTB). The target/
ACTB mRNA ratio was calculated as 2−ΔCT × K, where K is a constant.
Patient tumor specimens and IHC staining

Author Manuscript

Lung tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue specimens were obtained from patients with
histologically confirmed NSCLC who underwent surgical resection at the UC Davis Medical
Center. None of the patients had received pre-operative adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation
therapy. This investigation was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the UC Davis
Health System. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. The postsurgical pathological stage of each tumor was classified according to the International TNM
(Tumor, Node, Metastasis) Classification.48 Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
specimens were used, and the level of phospho-MARCKS was analyzed by IHC staining as
described previously.49 Detailed information on staining scoring is included in the
Supplementary Methods. These results were also reviewed and scored independently by two
pathologists.
Scratch wound-healing assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded to six-well tissue culture dishes and grown to confluence. Each confluent
monolayer was then wounded linearly using a pipette tip and washed three times with PBS.
Thereafter, cell morphology and migration were observed and photographed at regular
intervals for 12 h. The distance of cells migrating into the cell-free zone was acquired under
a light microscope and analyzed by Image-Pro Plus software (version 5.1; Media
Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA). The distances of cell migration were calculated by
subtracting the distance between the lesions’ edges at indicated time from the distance
measured at 0 h.
Transwell migration and invasion assays

Author Manuscript

An in vitro cell migration assay was performed as previously described25 using transwell
chambers (8-µm pore size; Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA). Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were
seeded on top of the polycarbonate filters, and 0.5 ml of growth medium at a RNS or MANS
peptide (100 µM) was added to both the upper and lower wells. After incubation for 12 h,
filters were swabbed with a cotton swab, fixed with methanol and then stained with Giemsa
solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). For the invasion assays, filters were coated
with matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and 2 × 104 cells were seeded
onto the matrigel and incubated for 20 h. The cells attached to the lower surface of the filter

Immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining
Western blot analyses and the preparations of whole-cell lysates have been previously
described.18 For whole-cell lysates, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM

phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride and 20 µg/ml aprotinin) and separated by SDS–PAGE
(sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Immunoblotting was
conducted with appropriate antibodies followed by chemiluminescent detection. For
immunofluorescent staining, cells cultured on 12-mm glass coverslips were fixed for 15 min
in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose and then permeabilized in PBS
containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Coverslips were reacted with primary antibody
against E-cadherin and FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-labeled anti-mouse secondary
antibody. F-actin was stained with TRITC (tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate)conjugated phalloidin, and nuclei were demarcated with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole) staining. The cells were mounted onto slides and visualized using
fluorescence microscopy (model Axiovert 100; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) or a
Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope image system.

In vivo subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation
Six-week-old nude mice and NOD SCID mice (supplied by Charles River Laboratories, San
Diego, CA, USA) were housed (four mice per cage) and fed autoclaved food ad libitum.
Detailed information on subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation of tumors is included in
the Supplementary Methods. Mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of UC Davis.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Data are presented as the mean ± s.d. for at least three independent experiments. The
quantitative in vitro and in vivo data were analyzed using the Student’s t-test. The difference
in patient characteristics between the high-expression and the low-expression groups was
analyzed using the Fisher’s exact test. All analyses were performed using the SPSS software
(v10.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided, and P values <
0.05 were considered statistically significant.
