Abstract
OX40 is a potent costimulatory receptor that can potentiate T-cell receptor signaling on the surface of T
lymphocytes, leading to their activation by a speciﬁcally recognized antigen. In particular, OX40 engagement
by ligands present on dendritic cells dramatically increases the proliferation, effector function, and survival of
T cells. Preclinical studies have shown that OX40 agonists increase antitumor immunity and improve tumorfree survival. In this study, we performed a phase I clinical trial using a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb)
that agonizes human OX40 signaling in patients with advanced cancer. Patients treated with one course of
the anti-OX40 mAb showed an acceptable toxicity proﬁle and regression of at least one metastatic lesion in 12
of 30 patients. Mechanistically, this treatment increased T and B cell responses to reporter antigen
immunizations, led to preferential upregulation of OX40 on CD4þ FoxP3þ regulatory T cells in tumorinﬁltrating lymphocytes, and increased the antitumor reactivity of T and B cells in patients with melanoma.
Our ﬁndings clinically validate OX40 as a potent immune-stimulating target for treatment in patients with
cancer, providing a generalizable tool to favorably inﬂuence the antitumor properties of circulating T cells, B
cells, and intratumoral regulatory T cells. Cancer Res; 73(24); 7189–98. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Antibodies, which target T-cell surface proteins, have
been shown to restore and enhance the function of
tumor-reactive T cells in vivo in tumor-bearing hosts (1–
5). The antagonists, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1, block negative signals to the T cells, whereas the agonists, anti-4-1BB
and anti-OX40, enhance T-cell function by increasing costimulation (6). A phase III clinical trial in patients with
metastatic melanoma demonstrated enhanced survival in
patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 and these results led to the
recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of
this antibody (7). Antibodies directed to PD-1 or PD-1 ligand
have produced complete and partial responses as well as
durable stable disease in patients with cancer (8, 9). The

strategy of blocking inhibitory T-cell pathways has shown
clinical activity and there is ample preclinical evidence that
T-cell costimulation via 4-1BB (10, 11) or OX40 can induce
antitumor effects (12–15).
We completed a translational research study to determine
the potential value of immunostimulatory antibody against
OX40. OX40 is a TNF-receptor family member that is
expressed primarily on activated CD4þ and CD8þ T cells
(16–18). Preclinical cancer models have shown that antiOX40 has potent antitumor activity against multiple tumor
types, which is dependent on both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells
(12–15). Immunization models have shown that anti-OX40
increased T-cell proliferation, effector cytokine production,
cytotoxicity, and decreased activation-induced cell death
leading to an increase in memory T cells (19–23). This report
describes the clinical, immunological, and antitumor effects
of an agonist antibody to OX40 in patients with advanced
cancer.

ELISA assays for tetanus and KLH
Recombinant tetanus toxoid C fragment (Roche), at 2
mg/mL, or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; Biosyn Corp.),
at 10 mg/mL, was absorbed on the surface of 96-well plates
(Fisher). Serum samples were then incubated for 1 hour,
followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab). TMB substrate solution (SureBlue TMB, KPL Inc.) was added, followed
by a stopping solution (85% O-Phosphoric Acid; Fisher). Spectrophotometry measurements were made at 450 nm (Wallac
Victor2 spectrophotometer; PerkinElmer).
ELISA assay for measurement of anti-OX40 (CD134) in
human serum
Titers in human serum were measured as indicated in
Supplementary Material and Methods.
Flow cytometry
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained
from patients and cryopreserved samples were used for ﬂow
cytometry studies. The ﬂuorochrome-labeled antibodies to
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD95, HLA-DR, CD45RA, CCR7, and Ki-67
were purchased from BD Pharmingen, Foxp3 and CXCR5 from
eBioscience, CD28 from Beckman Coulter, CD25 from Miltenyi
Biotech, CD38 and OX40 from BioLegend, and Streptavidin AF700 from Invitrogen. Intracellular staining was performed
using the Fix/Perm kit from eBioscience according to the
manufacturer's instructions. To prevent the interference of
human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) with staining, cells were
preincubated with the mAb anti-OX40 (9B12). Detection of
anti-OX40 binding was performed on fresh PBMCs using an
anti-mouse IgG and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rat
IgG (Invitrogen). Stained cells were analyzed on an LSRII or
the ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Aria (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using either Winlist
(Verity Software House) or FACSDiva (Becton Dickinson)
software.
Tumor-speciﬁc T-cell assays
Tumor-speciﬁc reactivity before and after anti-OX40 administration was assessed in PBMCs from 3 patients with melanoma. Autologous or HLA-matched melanoma cells were
cocultured with PBMCs at a PBMC:tumor ratio of 8:1 for 5
days. IFN-g in the supernatant was quantiﬁed using an IFN-g
ELISA kit (BD Biosciences). For Western blot analysis, FEMX
[American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] or HEK 293
(ATCC) cell lysates were heated to 100 C in gel sample buffer
with SDS for 5 minutes and 15 mg of protein were separated by
electrophoresis on a 10% SDS–PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The blocked membrane was incubated
with patient sera, then with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and exposed with enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) Western Blotting substrate (Pierce).
T-cell proliferation assay
Cryopreserved PBMCs (12 arm A samples and 11 arm
B samples), 1  105 PBMCs per well, were stimulated with
0.5 mg/mL of anti-CD28/anti-CD49d (BD Biosciences) and with

tetanus toxoid antigen (EMD Calbiochem) at 1 mg/mL for 4
days. Cells were then labeled with [3H]Thymidine (MP Biomedicals) for 18 hours, then harvested and counted on a Wallac
Trilux Microbeta scintillation counter. Tetanus-speciﬁc proliferation was measured by subtracting proliferation in the
absence of antigen from the tetanus toxoid-stimulated cultures. Fold increases were calculated by dividing the proliferation measured on day 43 (arm A) or day 15 (arm B) from the
proliferation observed before anti-OX40 administration.
Statistical analyses
Ki-67 analyses. For each cell population, the mean differences between treatment cohorts at study days 8 and 15 were
compared using one-way ANOVA on the log10 fold change from
baseline. The log10 transformation was performed to satisfy
statistical model assumptions. Comparisons between cohorts
were not adjusted for multiple comparisons due to the exploratory nature of the analyses. Mean differences in fold change
between responders and nonresponders at each study day
were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Analyses were performed using JMP version 9 (SAS Institute).
Tetanus and KLH-speciﬁc ELISA. For all statistical tests
of serum antibody response to KLH and tetanus, a cutoff
optical density value was established that would determine
the dilution at which the sera would be considered negative
(endpoint dilution). A best-ﬁt curve generated by a 1-phase
decay model was used to determine the optical density values
for the bottom plateau for each ELISA plate. The mean for all of
the plateaus on the plate þ4 SDs was used as the cutoff optical
density. The dilution at which each curve intersected the cutoff
is the endpoint dilution (titer) for that curve. The two arms
from all three cohorts were compared using a two-tailed
Mann–Whitney (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) analysis to determine whether the mean fold change increased signiﬁcantly
from baseline between the two arms.
T-cell proliferation assay. A two-tailed Mann–Whitney
(Wilcoxon rank-sum test) was used to determine whether the
mean thymidine incorporation was signiﬁcantly increased
when comparing the pretreatment levels with either day 43
for arm A or day 15 for arm B.
Tumor-speciﬁcity assay. IFN-g secretion from supernatants containing either pretreatment or posttreatment PBMCs
cocultured with either autologous, HLA-mismatched cell line,
or ﬂu, were compared using a one-tailed unpaired t test to
determine statistical signiﬁcance.

Results
Clinical results
Patients with metastatic solid malignancies refractory to
conventional therapy were enrolled in a phase I dose-escalation study using the 9B12 murine agonistic anti-human OX40
mAb, Trial ID#NCT01644968 (see Supplementary Fig. S1 and
Supplementary Materials and Methods). Consenting participants received a single cycle of anti-OX40 given intravenously
on days 1, 3, and 5. The study was designed with three cohorts
of 10 patients each. Patients in cohort 1 received one cycle of 0.1
mg/kg, cohort 2, 0.4 mg/kg, and cohort 3, 2 mg/kg of the mAb.
The main objectives of the clinical trial were to determine the

maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, immunologic activity, and
potential clinical activity following one cycle of anti-OX40.
Demographics. Supplementary Table S1 provides the
clinical characteristics and details of prior treatments. Prior
therapy included surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted
therapy, and immunotherapy. The median number of prior
cancer treatments was 2 (range, 0–8) and all had progression of
their cancer at the time of enrollment. All patients had performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
0 or 1.
Toxicity assessment. Twenty-eight of 30 patients received
all three planned anti-OX40 doses at the assigned dose
level. Table 1 summarizes the toxicities related to anti-OX40.
Most toxicity was grade 1 or 2, with the exception of lymphopenia in which grade 3 and 4 events were observed. Lymphopenia, fatigue, rash, and ﬂu-like symptoms with fever and chills
were the most common toxicities; they usually started after the
last anti-OX40 dose and generally resolved 72 hours later.
Lymphopenia was transient (Supplementary Fig. S2), and
resolved by day 15 in cohort 1 and day 28 in cohort 2. AntiOX40 was well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose was
not reached.
Pharmacokinetics and HAMA production. There was a
dose-dependent increase in peak serum anti-OX40 levels after
the ﬁrst and third doses (serum was not assessed following the
second dose), and a decrease thereafter (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Peak anti-OX40 levels were observed 2 hours after the third
dose. Anti-OX40 antibody was detected on the surface of
PBMCs when examined ex vivo by ﬂow cytometry, using an
anti-mouse–speciﬁc antibody. Between 9.9% and 26.9% of CD4
T cells and 0.6% and 7.8% of CD8 T cells were positive using this
technique (Supplementary Fig. S4). All but one patient tested
had high serum HAMA levels on day 28 (data not shown). There
was no increased toxicity or HAMA titers as the anti-OX40 dose
increased.

Tumor regression. Figure 1A shows a waterfall plot for
best response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) after anti-OX40. No patient achieved a
partial response by RECIST (>30% overall tumor shrinkage).
However, at least one tumor nodule regressed in 12 patients
and no change in the measurement of target lesions was
observed in 6 additional individuals during the 57-day observation period. Regression and SD were observed in patients
with melanoma, renal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the
urethra, prostate cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma. The longest
interval of stable disease lasted 470 days in a patient with renal
cancer, who received no other therapy during that time. Some
individuals had a decrease in measurable lesions at day 29, but
had progression by day 57. Figure 1B–E and Supplementary Fig.
S5A–S5H show examples of tumor regression in 3 patients
following anti-OX40. Mixed responses (e.g., simultaneous
regression of at least one tumor deposit and progression at
other sites) were observed in 2 patients with melanoma and 2
patients with renal cancer.
Immunologic results
Anti-OX40 increases proliferation of CD4 FoxP3neg and
CD8 T lymphocytes. To determine the effects of anti-OX40
on T cells, we performed multicolor ﬂow cytometry with
antibodies that recognized CD3, CD4, CD8, CD95, CD25, FoxP3,
CD28, and Ki-67. Changes in T-cell subpopulation frequencies
were determined using FCOM analysis tool in Winlist (24) and
statistically signiﬁcant changes were assessed using exhaustive
expansion analysis (25). Ki-67 expression, which is present only
within proliferating cells, was measured as OX40 agonists are
known to increase T-cell proliferation and this was the only
marker that was associated with signiﬁcant changes in the
exhaustive expansion analysis referenced above. Changes in
Ki-67 expression for both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells after antiOX40 administration and from a normal individual immunized
with tetanus were analyzed (Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S6A and S6B). PBMCs were gated on CD3, CD95, and CD4;
these markers are reported to identify antigen-experienced/
memory T cells (26), and further analyzed for FoxP3 [regulatory
T cell (Treg)] and Ki-67 (Fig. 2A). PBMCs from the same
patients were also gated on CD3, CD95, and CD8 and analyzed
for CD28 and Ki-67 (Fig. 2B). At baseline, the percentage of
proliferating/Ki-67þ CD4þ and CD8þ T cells ranged between
0.5% and 6.0% in patients and normal controls (Fig. 2 and data
not shown). The percentage of Ki-67þ CD4þ T cells started to
increase early (day 8) and the Ki-67þ CD8þ T cells later (day 15)
after anti-OX40 (summarized in Fig. 2C–F); the percentage of
proliferating cells in both populations usually returned to
pretreatment percentages by day 57. Typically, proliferating
CD8þ T cells were observed in both the CD28-positive and
-negative populations on day 15; however, the majority of
proliferating CD8þ T cells on day 29 were CD28þ. No significant changes in the percentage of Ki-67þ peripheral blood
lymphocytes (PBL) were detected among the normal donors
that were immunized with tetanus toxoid for any of these
populations at any time points (Fig. 2C–F). There was a
signiﬁcant increase in Ki-67þ lymphocytes in anti-OX40–treated patients compared with controls. Signiﬁcant increases

were observed for CD4þ/FoxP3 T cells, CD8þ T cells, and
CD3/NK cells (Fig. 2C, E, and F). The proliferation of CD4þ
FoxP3þ Treg was unaffected in anti-OX40–treated patients at
any dose when compared with controls (Fig. 2D). At day 15, the
proliferation of CD4þ FoxP3 cells showed a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in cohorts 1 and 2 compared with the
control group (P < 0.02). The augmentation of CD4þ FoxP3 Tcell proliferation in patients within the third cohort peaked on
day 8 and declined thereafter, which was a different pattern of
expression than the ﬁrst two cohorts. The increase in proliferation of CD8þ T cells peaked on day 15 for all three cohorts;
however, a signiﬁcant increase in proliferation was only
observed in the second cohort when compared with the
control group (P ¼ 0.001). A sustained increase in Ki-67þ
CD8þ T cells was found predominantly in patients from the
second cohort (through day 29). The average increase in
proliferation of the CD8þ T cells in cohort 3 was less than
that observed in cohort 2, despite the fact that patients
received a 5-fold higher dose of anti-OX40. The increase in
Ki-67 expression within the CD3/CD56þ cells was statistically
signiﬁcant in all cohorts compared with normal donors and
peaked 15 days after mAb treatment. The largest average fold
increase in the percentage of cycling cells for all three cell
populations (CD4þ/FoxP3, CD8þ, and NK cells) was observed

in cohort 2 (Fig. 2C, E, and F). In a post hoc analysis, patients
were designated as "nonprogressors" (initial decrease or stabilization of the disease) and "progressors" (tumor progression). Ki-67þ T cells among the CD4þ/FoxP3 population in
nonprogressors on day 8 and among CD8þ T lymphocytes on
days 5, 8, and 15 were signiﬁcantly greater than progressors
(Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). No signiﬁcant differences
were observed in Ki-67 expression in CD4þ FoxP3þ T cells or
CD3 lymphocytes (Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7D).
The generation of HAMA in all patients led us to consider
the possibility that the increase in Ki-67þ cells could be
attributed to an anti-mouse–speciﬁc immune response or
tetanus immunization rather than enhancing the endogenous T-cell repertoire. Because this could not be directly
tested in humans, we performed a study in non-human
primates to determine whether the infusion of a control
mouse IgG with tetanus vaccination would elicit a similar
increase in Ki-67þ expression by CD4þ and CD8þ T cells as
was observed in the clinical trial. Two groups of monkeys
received tetanus on day 1 and an intravenous injection of
either 1 mg/kg of anti-OX40 mAb or mouse IgG on days 1, 3,
and 5. PBMCs were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry with a panel
similar to the one described for human PBL. The mouse antihuman OX40 antibody increased Ki-67 expression in both

CD4þ and CD8þ T cells (Supplementary Fig.S8A and S8B).
However, no signiﬁcant increases in Ki-67 expression were
observed in either CD4þ or CD8þ lymphocytes isolated from
monkeys that had received tetanus and mouse IgG. These
data show that increased Ki-67 expression was induced by
anti-OX40 and not by a de novo immune response elicited to
a foreign mouse protein or tetanus immunization. To deﬁnitively establish that the increased proliferation of CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells was induced by the engagement of OX40, we
injected 4 monkeys with an agonistic monkey OX40L:Ig
fusion protein, which increased the mean percentage of
Ki-67þ CD4þ and CD8þ T cells with kinetics similar to the
anti-OX40 mAb (Supplementary Fig. S8C and S8D).
CD4þ T-cell analysis. We sought to explain why proliferation of Treg in PBL was less than other T-cell subsets.
Therefore, we examined OX40 expression on Treg and
CD4þ/FoxP3 T cells in tumors (Fig. 3A). We also compared
surface OX40 expression on Treg and CD4þ/FoxP3 T cells
in PBL and tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in 3 patients
with melanoma enrolled in this study and 2 patients with
untreated ovarian cancer. OX40 surface expression on nonTreg and Treg in the PBL was less than 20%, whereas more than
50% of Treg from TIL expressed OX40 (Fig. 3B and C). More-

over, the mean ﬂuorescence intensity for OX40 was up to 16fold higher in TIL compared with PBL Treg, suggesting that the
anti-OX40 may modulate Treg function in the tumor.
Anti-OX40 induces a transient decrease of follicular helper CD4þ T cells in the PBL. Anti-OX40 increased anti-TT and
anti-KLH antibodies, suggesting enhanced activity in T follicular helper cells. We analyzed the percentage of CD4þ
CD45RA CCR7þ CXCR5þ follicular helper T cells (27) in PBL
from patients and controls before and after anti-OX40
antibody. Figure 3D shows that there is signiﬁcant decrease
of this cell subset at day 8 in study patients compared with
controls, who have received the TT vaccine on day 1, but have

Anti-OX40 administration induces qualitative changes in
cycling CD8þT cells. The effect of anti-OX40 on the activation phenotype of cycling CD8þ T cells was examined by
assessing coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR, which is a
hallmark of proliferating, viral-speciﬁc human CD8þ T cells
following vaccination (28). The expression of CD38 and
HLA-DR on CD8þKi-67þ T cells after anti-OX40 was
analyzed. Figure 4A shows an individual patient, in whom
1.3% of the CD8þ T cells were Ki-67þ and 64.2% of them
coexpressed CD38 and HLA-DR before treatment. The

percentage of Ki-67þCD8þ T cells increased to 16.3% and
20.3% on days 15 and 29, respectively. On day 29, more than
95% of cycling cells expressed both CD38 and HLA-DR (Fig.
4A). A higher percentage of cycling CD8þ T cells expressed
both activation markers 56 days after anti-OX40 even
though the percentage of CD8þ/Ki-67þ cells had returned
to baseline. The mean percentage of CD38þ/HLA-DRþ/Ki67þ CD8þ T cells in 11 anti-OX40–treated patients was
compared with nine normal donors immunized with tetanus (Fig. 4B). At days 29 and 57, there was a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of HLA-DRþCD38þKi67þ CD8þ T cells compared with controls, suggesting that
engagement of OX40 increased proliferation and activation
of CD8þ T cells.

patients received tetanus on day 1 and KLH on day 29. Peak
antibody levels to KLH and tetanus were assessed 15 days after
immunization, which was either on day 15 or 43 (arm A vs. arm
B, respectively) after anti-OX40. Tetanus antibody titers were

calculated both pre- and post–anti-OX40 and fold increases
were calculated for all patients. A signiﬁcant fold increase in
antibody response was found in patients who were immunized
with tetanus or KLH on the same day as anti-OX40 compared
with patients immunized 28 days later (Fig. 5A–C and Supplementary Fig. 9). Tetanus-speciﬁc T-cell proliferation was
assessed from PBMCs obtained before and 15 days after
immunization. There was a signiﬁcant fold increase in proliferation when the post–anti-OX40 samples from arm B were
compared with arm A, P ¼ 0.0127 (Fig. 5B). Patients in arm A
who had increases in their anti-KLH antibody response also
had a signiﬁcantly higher increase of Ki-67þ CD8þ T cells on
day 15 as compared with low antibody responders (P ¼ 0.017,

were found in the PBMCs/tumor supernatants after anti-OX40

Discussion
Antibodies that enhance T-cell proliferation, survival, and
effector function are currently being assessed in clinical
trials for patients with cancer. Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA4 mAb, was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment
of advanced melanoma (7). Preclinical studies indicate
that anti-OX40 and anti-CTLA-4 have similar abilities to

increased in response to autologous tumor in 2 patients, but
not to HLA-mismatched tumor lines. The increase in tumorspeciﬁc IFN-g, following anti-OX40 was primarily elicited by
CD8þ T cells, as the increase in IFN-g production was blocked
by anti-HLA-ABC antibody, but not by anti-HLA-DR antibody
and it was selectively detected in CD8þ T cells by ﬂow
cytometry (data not shown). There were no signiﬁcant differences in inﬂuenza-induced IFN-g production by PBMCs collected before or after anti-OX40 (Fig. 6A and B).

stimulate T cells in both basic and tumor immunology
models (4, 13, 29, 30); anti-OX40 by costimulation and
anti-CTLA-4 by blocking inhibition. Here, we report the ﬁrst
clinical and immunologic assessment of anti-OX40 in
patients with cancer. Anti-OX40 was well tolerated; mild to
moderate side effects included a brief period of lymphopenia, fatigue, fever/chills, and mild rashes. The MTD was not
reached within the dose levels tested. There was tumor
shrinkage in 12 of 30 patients following just one cycle,
although there were no responses using RECIST. The major
limitation of this mouse mAb was the induction of HAMA,
which precluded the administration of multiple cycles.
Despite this limitation, much was learned about the immunomodulatory effects of OX40. The results of this proof-ofprinciple study will help in the design and monitoring of
future clinical trials using humanized OX40 agonists that we
anticipate will lead to increased immunologic activation and
greater clinical activity.
The immune stimulatory effects of anti-OX40 observed in
humans are similar to those described in mice and monkeys
(31, 32). A signiﬁcant increase in proliferation of both CD4þ
and CD8þ T cells was observed starting seven days after the
initial infusion and lasting for at least 15 days, and sometimes up to a month. There was a dose-dependent increase
in CD4þ and CD8þ T-cell proliferation when the dose was
increased from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg. However, at 2 mg/kg, a

different kinetic pattern of CD4þ T-cell proliferation and a
reduced increase in CD8þ T-cell proliferation was observed.
We do not know the biologic reason for the difference
observed at the highest anti-OX40 dose. Anti-OX40 did not
seem to increase CD4þ/FoxP3þ Treg proliferation possibly
due to the differences in OX40 expression between PBL and
TIL. Ki-67 expression by T cells has also recently been
assessed in prostate cancer patients treated with antiCTLA-4 (33). Anti-CTLA-4 increased proliferation of both
FoxP3þ and FoxP3 CD4þ T cells in a dose-dependent
manner (33). The pattern of immunologic response seen
with anti-OX40 could be of beneﬁt to patients with cancer,
because Treg are known to dampen immunity to tumor (34).
Our observation that TIL Treg express more OX40 than PBL
Treg suggests that tumor biopsy studies will be important in
understanding OX40 biology and antitumor effects.
Anti-OX40 induced proliferation of CD8þ T cells, including CD8þ T cells expressing the activation markers CD38
and HLA-DR, increasing the immunologic potency of these
cells. We speculate that a percentage of the Ki-67þ T cells in
these patients with cancer are tumor-speciﬁc. Although the
antigens recognized by the proliferating T cells have not
been identiﬁed, we have evidence that anti-OX40 increased
CD8þ T cell IFN-g production in 2 of 3 patients with
melanoma, in which autologous tumor lines were used to
assess tumor reactivity. Similar enhanced antitumor effects

have been recently described in patients with prostate
cancer receiving anti-CTLA-4 (35).
Anti-OX40 signiﬁcantly increased antibody titers and
T-cell recall responses to tetanus immunization. Although
similar effects have been observed in mouse models with
anti-OX40 and other immune stimulating antibodies (36), to
our knowledge this is the ﬁrst veriﬁcation of these activities
in humans. This effect might be mediated by follicular helper
T cells that were transiently decreased in the PBL in OX40treated patients compared with normal controls. This
decrease might suggest that these cells trafﬁcked to lymph
nodes, in which they inﬂuenced B-cell–mediated antibody
production. This observation provides a rationale for testing
anti-OX40 in conjunction with vaccination to increase Tand B-cell responses to immunizing Ags in future clinical
studies. Anti-OX40 could also serve as adjuvant after disruption of a tumor by radio- or chemotherapy to release
tumor Ags.
In summary, administration of anti-OX40 mAb was well
tolerated and enhanced both humoral and cellular immunity
in patients with cancer. Anti-OX40 increased proliferation
of peripheral blood CD4þ and CD8þ T cells, increased
responses to recall and na€ve reporter Ags, and increased
endogenous tumor-speciﬁc immune responses. We anticipate that multiple doses of a humanized anti-OX40 agonist
will lead to stronger immunologic activation and greater
tumor regression (37).
