ABSTRACT
Objective To analyze the efficacy of gemcitabine with or without erlotinib for
pancreatic cancer, and to determine the predictive role of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and KRAS mutations in these patients.
Methods This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, prospective trial.
Eighty-eight chemotherapy-naïve metastatic pancreatic cancer patients were
randomized for treatment with gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus erlotinib. EGFR and
KRAS mutations were analyzed, respectively. The primary endpoint was the disease
control rate.
Results Disease control rate (64% vs. 25%; P < 0.001), progression-free survival
(median 3.8 vs. 2.4 months; P < 0.001), and overall survival (median 7.2 vs. 4.4
months; P < 0.001) were better in the gemcitabine plus erlotinib group than in the
gemcitabine alone group. In the gemcitabine plus erlotinib group, disease control
(85% vs. 33%; P = 0.001), progression-free survival (median 5.9 vs. 2.4 months; P
= 0.004), and overall survival (median 8.7 vs. 6.0 months; P = 0.044) were better in
patients with EGFR mutations than in those without EGFR mutations. KRAS mutation
was not associated with treatment response or survival.
Conclusions Gemcitabine plus erlotinib is more effective than gemcitabine
alone for treating metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, especially those with EGFR
mutations. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01608841.

INTRODUCTION

Pancreatic cancer shows the highest frequency of
KRAS gene mutations among human cancers [16]. Ras
signaling pathways are commonly activated in tumors
and are involved in mediating the downstream effects of
EGFR activation. Greater than 95% of these mutations
involve codon 12 or 13 (exon 2), and a few involve codon
61 (exon 3) [16]. Whether KRAS mutations are associated
with less efficient EGFR-directed targeted therapy in
pancreatic cancer patients remains controversial and
requires further investigation [17, 18].
To clarify the effects of adding erlotinib to
gemcitabine and the roles of EGFR and KRAS mutations as
predictive biomarkers in patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer who receive these regimens, we performed this
open-label, randomized, prospective study.

Pancreatic cancer is a rapidly progressive
malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of <10% [1].
Gemcitabine is the standard chemotherapy for metastatic
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but shows an objective
response rate of only 5–10% and a median survival of 5.7–
6.8 months [2-5]. During the last decade, many trials have
been conducted on combined treatment with gemcitabine
and targeted agents in an attempt to improve treatment
outcome [6-8]. Unfortunately, most trials have failed to
demonstrate any survival benefit compared to gemcitabine
alone.
The mutation status of the EGFR tyrosine kinase
(TK) domain is a predictive factor for EGFR inhibitor
therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially
among the Chinese people [9-14]. Whether this result
applies to pancreatic cancer remains unclear. Erlotinib,
a selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is an orally active agent
for advanced NSCLC and pancreatic cancer [3, 15]. The
phase III NCIC CTG PA.3 trial comparing gemcitabine
plus erlotinib and gemcitabine alone in advanced
pancreatic cancer is the only trial of a targeted agent in
pancreatic cancer that has shown a statistically significant
improvement in survival [3]. However, the survival was
only slightly longer for the gemcitabine plus erlotinib arm
versus the gemcitabine plus placebo arm (median 6.24 vs.
5.91 months, P = 0.038). Considering cost effectiveness
and the survival benefit, it is important to be able to
accurately select the subgroup of patients who could
benefit from this therapeutic regimen.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between July 2005 and June 2012, 88 patients were
randomly assigned (44 gemcitabine plus erlotinib and 44
gemcitabine alone) (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics
(Table 1) were well matched between the gemcitabine plus
erlotinib arm and the gemcitabine alone arm. The median
follow-up time was 7.2 months (range, 0.1–30.5 months)
for the gemcitabine plus erlotinib group and 4.5 months
(range, 0.4–16.9 months) for the gemcitabine alone group.

Forty-nine (56%) patients had 62 mutations in
EGFR exons 18–21 that caused substantial downstream
amino acid changes (activating mutations, Supplementary
Table 2). All mutations were heterozygous (Supplementary
Figure 1) and confirmed by next-generation sequencing.

Exon 20 was the most commonly mutated exon (50%
of the mutations), followed by exon 19 (37%), exon 21
(10%), and exon 18 (3%). L778P in exon 20 was the most
common mutation site (24% of all mutations), followed by
K728R (19%) and W731X (13%) in exon 19, and I821T
(15%) in exon 20. Patients with an L778P mutation who
received gemcitabine plus erlotinib had a significantly
higher disease control rate than those who received
gemcitabine alone (71%, N = 7 vs. 0%, N = 8; P = 0.007,
Supplementary Table 2).
Silent mutations were found in 18/88 patients. Six
patients had a Q787Q mutation in exon 20, and two of
these had additional missense mutations. Four had an
F795F mutation, and two of these had other missense
mutations. Two had a D800D mutation together with other
missense mutations. One had a Q812Q mutation in exon
20 with a simultaneous missense mutation (I821T). Five
had a D830D mutation in exon 21, and of these, one had
a D830D mutation only. In both the gemcitabine alone
and the gemcitabine plus erlotinib groups, response rates,
disease control rates, PFS, and OS were not different
between patients with silent EGFR mutations and patients
without mutations. Patients with silent EGFR mutations
were counted as patients without EGFR mutations in this
study.
No activating EGFR mutation was found in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

buffy coat of all patients, indicating that the mutations
occurred somatically during carcinogenesis.

EGFR mutations and tumor response
In the gemcitabine alone group, response rate,
disease control rate, and CA19-9 response rate were
comparable between patients with and without EGFR
mutations (Table 2). In the gemcitabine plus erlotinib
group, patients with EGFR mutations had a significantly
higher disease control rate (85% vs. 33%; P = 0.001) and a
significantly higher rate of a >50% CA19-9 decline (58%
vs. 22%; P = 0.020).

EGFR mutations and survival
Patients receiving gemcitabine alone had similar
PFS and OS regardless of the presence of EGFR mutations
(Figures 3A and 4A). In the gemcitabine plus erlotinib
group, patients with EGFR mutations had a significantly
longer PFS (5.9 months; 95% CI, 4.5 to 7.3 months vs. 2.4
months; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.3 months; P = 0.004, Figure 3B)
and a significantly longer OS (8.7 months; 95% CI, 6.2 to
11.1 months vs. 6.0 months; 95% CI, 3.0 to 8.9 months; P
= 0.044, Figure 4B) than those without EGFR mutations.

for assessment of toxicity. Adverse events are summarized
in Table 3.
Treatment was generally well tolerated in both arms.
Patients receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib experienced
a significantly higher frequency of rash (64% vs. 2%,
P < 0.001), but these were generally grade 1 or 2. The
incidence of other adverse events, including hematologic
toxicity and elevations in alanine aminotransferase, were
similar between groups. There were no protocol-related
deaths. One patient in the gemcitabine plus erlotinib group
had interstitial lung disease (ILD)-like syndrome possibly
related to therapy.
The gemcitabine dose intensity was similar in the
gemcitabine alone and gemcitabine plus erlotinib groups
(905 ± 182 mg•m-2•dose-1 x 8.2 ± 5.5 doses vs. 881 ± 236
mg•m-2dose-1 x 17.1 ± 13.4 doses). Four (9%) patients
receiving erlotinib and gemcitabine had at least one dose
reduction of their oral agent. The erlotinib dose intensity
was 96.8 ± 12.6 mg•m-2day-1 x 17.9 ± 13.7 weeks.

Tumor specimens from 83/88 pancreatic
adenocarcinomas (94.3%) had a point mutation of
KRAS in exon 2 or 3. There were 74 mutations in exon
2 (codon 12 or 13), two mutations in exon 3 (codon 61),
and seven mutations in both exon 2 and exon 3. KRAS
mutations were not associated with clinical and pathologic
parameters including age, sex, ECOG performance status,
tumor location, histologic differentiation, levels of CA199, response to chemotherapy, PFS, and OS. Patients with
KRAS mutations did not have a statistically different rate
of EGFR mutations (58% vs. 20%, P = 0.166) compared
to patients without KRAS mutations.

Toxicity and dosage modifications
Forty-four patients treated with gemcitabine and
erlotinib and 44 treated with gemcitabine alone received

erlotinib group

pancreatic cancer has not been investigated until now. The
EGFR mutation profile in the Chinese population analyzed
in this study can be used to predict treatment response
and survival in pancreatic cancer patients receiving
gemcitabine plus erlotinib.
The NCIC CTG PA.3 trial demonstrated the
beneficial effects of erlotinib in the treatment of pancreatic
cancer [3]. However, no Chinese patients were included
in that study and the prolongation of median OS with
erlotinib was only slightly longer, at 0.33 months. Neither
EGFR protein expression status nor gene copy number
was identified as a marker predictive of survival benefit
following combination treatment with erlotinib and
gemcitabine [3, 17]. In the present study, we used direct
sequencing to detect EGFR mutations and confirmed by
next-generation sequencing, which accurately predicted
treatment response and survival in Chinese pancreatic
cancer patients.
The median OS of patients treated with gemcitabine
plus erlotinib (regardless of EGFR mutations) was 7.2
months. The NCIC CTG PA.3 trial, which included
both locally advanced pancreatic cancer and metastatic
pancreatic cancer patients, showed that the median OS

Of the 44 patients receiving gemcitabine plus
erlotinib, 16 had no rash, 17 had grade 1 rash, 7 had grade
2 rash, 3 had grade 3 rash, and 1 had grade 4 rash. Patients
with EGFR mutations did not have a significantly different
rate of skin rash than patients without EGFR mutations
(73% vs. 50%; P = 0.118). The presence of rash was
associated with significantly higher rates of disease control
(75% vs. 44%; P = 0.038) and treatment response (29% vs.
0%; P = 0.036). Patients with skin rash had significantly
longer PFS (6.4 months; 95% CI, 4.1 to 8.7 months vs. 2.4
months; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.0 months; P = 0.006, Figure 5A)
and OS (8.6 months; 95% CI, 6.1 to 11.0 months vs. 5.8
months; 95% CI, 3.1 to 8.6 months; P = 0.043, Figure 5B).

DISCUSSION
EGFR mutations are known to be the most important
determinants of NSCLC patient response to EGFR-TKIs
[9-14]. However, the importance of EGFR mutations in

with gemcitabine plus erlotinib was 6.24 months [3]. The
more favorable outcome is likely because of the higher
rate of EGFR mutations in this study [19, 20], which
enhanced treatment efficacy [9, 10, 12, 13]. These results
are encouraging, especially because all patients were
already in the metastatic stage.
The median survival with gemcitabine alone in this
trial (4.4 months) is lower than that found by Burris et al.
(5.65 months) [2], Moore et al. (5.91 months) [3], Conroy
et al. (FOLFIRINOX, 6.8 months) [4], and the Metastatic
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial (MPACT, 6.6
months) [5]. In this trial, the disease control rate with
gemcitabine alone (25%) is also lower than that in the
gemcitabine arms of the above trials (Burris et al., 44.4%;
Moore et al., 49.2%; FOLFIRINOX, 50.9%; MPACT,
33%) [2-5]. Our results are similar to another study of
patients of Chinese descent (median survival 4 months)
[21]. Other than ethnic differences, advanced age (median
age 70 years in this study vs. 61-64 years in other studies)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and advanced stage (all stage IV) may also account for the
relatively poor survival and lower disease control rate in
the gemcitabine alone group in this study.
In NSCLC and breast cancer, the prevalence of
EGFR mutations between Caucasian and Asian patients
is different [10, 22]. For NSCLC, there are variations
between Chinese and other Asian populations [23,
24]. Lynch et al. did not detect any mutations in EGFR
exons 19 and 21 in 40 pancreatic cancer primary tumors
in Caucasian patients [9]. Tzeng et al. reported that
6/9 pancreatic cancer cell lines and 25/31 Caucasian
pancreatic cancer patients had EGFR mutations, but all
were silent mutations [20]. Oh et al. and Lee et al. showed
a rate of 1.5–2.5% EGFR mutations in Korean pancreatic
cancer cohorts [16, 25]. However, none of these patients
was Chinese. Our study was conducted in Taiwan, where
the majority of the population is of Chinese descent, and
the pancreatic cancer EGFR mutation rate was 56%.
Improvement in OS for pancreatic cancer patients treated

with erlotinib was apparent in our study because of the
high proportion of cases with EGFR mutations compared
to other studies. Currently, pancreatic cancer is the 7th
leading cause of cancer death among the Chinese, making
EGFR mutation detection an important issue in the
treatment of pancreatic cancer [26].
The mutation sites in Chinese pancreatic cancer
patients are also different from those reported in other
populations [16, 25]. The presence of EGFR-activating
mutations in Chinese patients emphasizes ethnic,
geographic, and environmental variations in pancreatic
cancer mutation profiles that could result in different
responses to erlotinib treatment. Similar to reports by
Tzeng et al. and Lee et al., we found Q787Q to be the most
common silent mutation [16, 20]. In addition, we found
four silent mutations that have not yet been reported,
suggesting that EGFR silent mutations may vary among
ethnicities.
The pattern of EGFR mutations varies among
different solid tumors. In NSCLC, missense L858R and
in-frame deletion E746_A750del constitute 78.2% of
mutations [27]. All mutations in exon 19 (7.3%) were
in-frame deletions (E746_A750del) in the squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck [28], whereas two types of
deletions, K745_E749del and E746_A750del, were found
in exon 19 in cholangiocarcinomas [29]. Substitutions
in exons 19 (E749K) and 20 (E762G and A767T) were
predominant in 12% of colorectal carcinomas [30]. All
of these mutations are different from those found in our
work. Owing to these differences in the mutation profiles
of EGFR for pancreatic cancer, compared with other
cancers, commercially available EGFR mutation detection
kits cannot replace direct sequencing [31].
Erlotinib-mediated disease control in EGFRmutated pancreatic cancer patients is modest, with many
patients achieving stable disease (85%). This is similar
to the observations of Kwak et al. [19] who showed that
both pancreatic cancer patients with EGFR mutations
exhibited disease stabilization in response to therapy with
erlotinib and capecitabine; however, this result does not
fall within the same category of dramatic responses seen
in NSCLC [9-14]. Further investigation is required to
determine whether the site of primary cancer accounts for
the disparate effects of TKI.
The gemcitabine plus erlotinib group had a higher
disease control rate than the gemcitabine alone group for
patients with an L778P mutation. Other mutation sites
failed to demonstrate a significant difference in response
and disease control rates. Because of their rarity, it is
difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the true
relationship between uncommon EGFR mutations and
sensitivity to erlotinib. Further studies with larger patient
numbers and functional analysis of the EGFR mutations
are warranted to elucidate the impact of the individual
mutation sites on the efficacy of erlotinib use.
There was no correlation between KRAS and EGFR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutations in our study, unlike the case in lung cancer,
where these are generally mutually exclusive [32].
Furthermore, KRAS mutation status did not predict how
patients would respond to erlotinib in our study, which
is in line with the pivotal PA.3 study [17]. The small
numbers of patients in our study (5.7%) who had wildtype KRAS make comparisons difficult with data from
other randomized trials.
Most adverse events associated with erlotinib
plus gemcitabine treatment in this study were mild-tomoderate, consistent with previous studies [2-5]. Rash
was more frequent with erlotinib plus gemcitabine than
with gemcitabine alone, and we observed the association
between rash and a better outcome that has been seen in
other pancreatic cancer studies of EGFR inhibitors [3, 33,
34]. One patient in the gemcitabine plus erlotinib arm had
ILD-like syndrome. Gemcitabine and EGFR TKIs are both
known to cause ILD-like syndrome, and it is possible that
there is a more-than-additive effect when these agents are
combined [35]. The incidence seen in this study (2.3%) is
similar to that in other trials with combined gemcitabine
and erlotinib [3].
FOLFIRINOX (a multidrug regimen of fluorouracil,
leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) showed an
increased median survival of 4.3 months but a worse
safety profile compared to treatment with gemcitabine
[4]. In another phase III multinational MPACT study,
the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel was
shown to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy, with
a 1.8-month increase in median survival [5]. Combination
therapy with gemcitabine plus erlotinib, gemcitabine plus
nab-paclitaxel, or leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and
oxaliplatin is now considered first-line chemotherapy for
metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic cancer tends to be relatively resistant
to chemotherapy and targeted therapy [6-8], and only
a few regimens have proven efficacious [2-5, 36]. Our
study first found that EGFR mutations are common in
Chinese pancreatic cancer patients. In addition, this study
showed that EGFR mutations can predict gemcitabine plus
erlotinib treatment response and survival. However, this
study did have some limitations. First, the sample size
of 88 participants is relatively small. However, a strong
association was still detected between EGFR mutations
and the efficacy of erlotinib in pancreatic cancer. Second,
all enrollees were Chinese, and these results might not
apply to other ethnicities. These issues require further
investigation in additional larger clinical studies.
In conclusion, this is the first study to show a
significant association between EGFR mutations and
survival benefit in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients
receiving erlotinib combined with gemcitabine. Detection
of EGFR mutations can be used to identify the subgroup
of patients with pancreatic cancer in whom EGFR may
be essential for tumor growth and who would thus benefit
from treatment with erlotinib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

computed tomography-guided biopsy (15 patients),
endoscopic biopsy (4 patients), open biopsy (9 patients),
or pancreatectomy (20 patients). Tumor samples were
obtained from primary pancreatic tumor (n = 44) or
metastatic tissue (n = 44). All tissue sections were cut
from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor blocks, and
histological examination was performed by a pathologist
(YCY) blinded to clinical information. All tumor regions
were confirmed prior to DNA isolation. The buffy coat,
representing the normal tissue and separated using
Histopaque solution (Histopaque-1119; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA), was obtained from all patients at
enrollment. DNA was extracted from sections and the
buffy coat using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany).

Patient selection
This study was a single-center, randomized, openlabel, prospective phase II trial. Inclusion criteria were
metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, presence of
at least one measureable lesion, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2, absolute
neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3, platelet count ≥ 100,000/
mm3, serum creatinine level ≤ 1.5× upper normal limit,
aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase
level ≤ 5× upper normal limit, adequate samples for
histological and mutational analyses, and absence of any
other malignancy or serious medical or psychological
illness that would preclude informed consent.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing
of the EGFR gene

Ethics statement

Eight pairs of oligonucleotide primers were used
to amplify exons 18–21 of the EGFR gene using PCR as
described previously (Supplementary Table 1) [9]. The
PCR products were extracted and purified from a 1.5%
agarose gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen)
and sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and the ABI
PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). PCR amplicon sequences were
compared with the EGFR cDNA sequence obtained from
Genbank (accession no. GI:22022643) by using Mutation
Surveyor™ 3.0 (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA)
and manual review. All sequence variants were verified by
reverse sequencing.

Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital,
conforms to CONSORT guidelines, and was registered as
ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01608841.

Randomization
Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio
to receive either gemcitabine (Gemzar ®; Eli Lilly and
Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) plus erlotinib (Tarceva;
OSI Pharmaceuticals, Farmingdale, NY, USA) or
gemcitabine alone using a computerized random number
function in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA,
USA). A block randomization procedure was employed to
ensure equal group allocation.

Ion torrent deep-amplicon sequencing
To eliminate PCR artifacts and false positives, the
GeneRead DNA FFPE kit was used to extract DNA. The
DNA extracted from FFPE was used for multiplex PCR of
a panel covering 18–21 exons in the EGFR gene. Fragment
libraries were constructed using DNA fragmentation,
barcode and adaptor ligation, and library amplification,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as stipulated
in the Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Size distribution
of the DNA fragments was analyzed using the Agilent
Bioanalyzer with the High Sensitivity Kit (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). Template preparation, emulsion
PCR, and Ion Sphere Particle (ISP) enrichment was
performed using the Ion PGM Template OT2 200 Kit (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The ISPs were loaded onto
a 314 chip and sequenced using an Ion PGM Sequencing
200 Kit v2 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA).

Treatment
Gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 was infused over 30
minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 followed by
a 1-week rest in cycle 1, and on days 1, 8, and 15 in all
subsequent 4-week cycles. Erlotinib was taken orally at
100 mg once a day. Treatment continued until disease
progression or intolerable toxicity.

disease progression or death as a result of any cause. For
patients alive without documented disease progression at
the time of the analysis, PFS was censored at the time of
the last tumor assessment. If no post-baseline assessment
was performed, the date of random assignment plus 1
day was used as the censor date. OS was defined as the
time from random assignment until death as a result of
any cause, and patients alive at the time of the analysis
were censored at the date of last contact. In the response
rate analysis, patients without a post-baseline assessment
were not assessed. PFS and OS were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests. The Student’s t
test or one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze
continuous variables between groups. The association
between skin rash, EGFR mutations, response rate, and
disease control rate were compared using the Chi-square
test or Fisher’s exact test. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS software (SPSS 21.0, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

After a successful sequencing reaction, the raw
signal data were analyzed using Torrent Suite v4.0.2.
The pipeline includes signaling processing, base calling,
quality score assignment, adapter trimming, PCR duplicate
removal, read alignment to human genome19 reference,
mapping quality QC, coverage analysis, and variant
calling. After completion of the primary data analysis,
lists of detected sequence variants (SNVs and INDELs)
were compiled in the VCF (Variant call file) format. For
downstream analysis, variants with a minimum coverage
of 500 reads were selected.

PCR and sequencing of the KRAS gene
The cobas® KRAS Mutation Test (Roche
Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) was used according to
the manufacturer’s protocol [37]. Samples (50 ng of DNA)
were aliquoted in 96-well plates, and negative and positive
controls from the kit were added. Data were automatically
processed by cobas® software.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The study was assisted in part by the Division of
Experimental Surgery of the Department of Surgery,
Taipei Veterans General Hospital to CPL. We thank Miss
I-Hsuan Tsai at the Research and Development, TVGH
Lihpao Lab of Cancer Genomic Medicine, Lihpao Life
Science. Co., Ltd. for assisting with the next-generation
sequencing.

Evaluation of treatment response and safety
Objective tumor response was evaluated every 8
weeks or earlier for patients with suspected progression
according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST 1.0)[38]; responses were confirmed at
least 28 days after the first documentation of a complete
or partial response or stable disease. Images were blindly
reviewed by a protocol-trained radiologist (RCL). Serial
measurements of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)
were performed at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter.
Safety was monitored by assessing treatment-related
adverse events and serious adverse events according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (v3.0).

COMPETING INTERESTS
We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.

FUNDING
The study was funded by Taipei Veterans General
Hospital (V103C-201), the National Science Council
(NSC 98-2314-B-075-029), the Research Foundation of
Digestive Medicine, R.O.C. (10311), and the National
Research Program for Biopharmaceutics of Taiwan
(100CT202). The funders had no role in study design, data
collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation
of the manuscript.

Statistical analysis
A superiority test was conducted with the
assumption that gemcitabine plus erlotinib would have a
higher disease control rate [3], defined as the best overall
response for complete or partial response or stable disease,
than gemcitabine alone. The disease control rate was
estimated as 30% in the gemcitabine alone group, and
60% in the gemcitabine plus erlotinib group [5, 39]. A
sample size of 44 for each group was required for 80%
power with 5% error (two-tailed) and 5% loss to followup [40]. Secondary outcome measures were response rate,
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),
relation to EGFR and KRAS mutation status, and safety.
PFS was defined as the time from random assignment to
