BACKGROUND: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have activity in
solid tumors. The authors evaluated an oral EGFR TKI, erlotinib, in patients with previously treated esophageal cancer.
METHODS: Thirty patients with measurable, metastatic cancer of the esophageal and gastroesophageal junction
received 150 mg erlotinib daily. EGFR-negative tumors (6 patients; 20%) and EGFR-over expressing tumors (24
patients; 80%) were treated. Most patients were men (70%) with adenocarcinoma (57%) and had received previous
chemotherapy (97%). RESULTS: Two partial responses were observe d in the EGFR-positive cohort (2 of 24 patients;
8%), and no responses were observed in the EGFR-negative cohort (0 of 6 patients). Reponses were limited to
patients who had squamous cell carcinoma (2 of 13 patients; 15%; response duration, 5.5-7 months). The time to tumor progression was longer in patients who had squamous cell carcinoma (3.3 months; range, 1-24 months) compared with patients who had adenocarcinoma (1.6 months; range, 1-6 months; P ¼ .026). Therapy was tolerable with
the expected toxicity of skin rash (grade 1-2, 67%; grade 3, 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib had limited activity in
patients with esophageal cancer, and responses and some protracted stable disease were observed in those with
squamous cell carcinoma. Efficacy according to EGFR status could not be assessed given the rarity of EGFR-negative
tumors. The current results indicated that further evaluation of this agent in squamous cell carcinoma is warranted.

KEYWORDS: esophageal cancer, squamous cancer, erlotinib, response evaluation.

Esophageal cancer is a leading worldwide cause of cancer mortality and accounts for the eighth most common
cause of cancer-related death.1 Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction is increasing at an alarming rate in Western countries and is now the most common histology reported in Western Europe and the United States.2
Squamous cell carcinoma remains the predominant histology worldwide, although, in the United States, squamous cancer
is decreasing in all populations, including African Americans.3 Despite modest improvements in survival with either preoperative chemotherapy or combined chemoradiotherapy in conjunction with surgery,4 the majority of patients with
localized disease will develop metastatic disease. Systemic chemotherapy in metastatic esophageal cancer has limited effectiveness, with responses observed in 20% to 40% of patients, resulting in a median survival of 8 months to 10 months.5
After disease progression on first-line chemotherapy, there is no standard second-line treatment. The low activity and brief
duration of benefit for chemotherapy to palliate metastatic disease and the limited impact of systemic therapy in the preoperative setting make clear the need to identify new active agents.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is an important transmembrane signal-transduction pathway for many solid tumors, including esophageal cancer.6 Over expression of EGFR is common in both esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. EGFR expression correlates with a more advanced tumor stage and a reduction
in overall survival for patients with esophageal cancer.7,8 Activation of the EGFR pathway results in downstream activation of other growth-promoting pathways, including the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3Corresponding author: David H.

kinase/serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT), Janus kinanse/signal transducers and activators of transcription
(JAK/STAT), and protein kinase C.6 Oral agents that inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase (TKIs), including erlotinib, reportedly have antitumor activity in patients with
nonsmall cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer with
acceptable toxicity.9,10
In this report, we relate the results from a phase 2
trial of the EGFR TKI erlotinib in patients with esophageal cancer who had received previous chemotherapy.
Our primary study endpoint was the antitumor response
rate. Patients who had EGFR-negative and EGFR-over
expressing tumors with adenocarcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma histology were enrolled.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This single-center, single-arm phase 2 study was conducted at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
The protocol and the consent form were approved by the
Memorial Hospital Institutional Review Board, and all
patients provided signed informed consent.
Eligibility
Patients had a histologic diagnosis of metastatic or surgically unresectable adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction
confirmed at Memorial Hospital. Tumors that extended
into the stomach had to have at least 50% involvement of
the distal esophagus (Siewert types I and II). Prior radiotherapy was permitted. Up to 1 previous chemotherapy
regimen was allowed for metastatic disease, and up to 2
were allowed if 1 was administered as adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. Measurable disease was required and
was defined as at least 1 lesion measurable in 1 dimension
that measured either 20 mm with conventional techniques or 10 mm on a spiral computed tomography (CT)
scan. Eligibility also included a Karnofsky performance
status 70% and organ function defined by an absolute
neutrophil count >1500/lL, platelet count 100,000/
lL, bilirubin level <2 times the upper limit of normal,
aspartate aminotransferase level <2 times the upper limit
of normal, serum calcium 12 mg/dL, and creatinine
level 1.5 mg/dL. Tumor tissue samples from each
patient were tested for EGFR expression before the start
of therapy. Exclusion criteria included known brain or
central nervous system metastases and uncontrolled, intercurrent illness, including active infection, symptomatic
congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, and ven-

1410

tricular arrhythmia. Pregnant women were excluded. No
concurrent malignancy was allowed except for treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, superficial transitional cell
carcinoma of the bladder, or basal/squamous cell skin
cancer.
Study Assessments
Before treatment, patients underwent a complete history
and physical examination; a complete blood count; serum
and liver chemistries, including phosphorus and magnesium; prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time; and
urinalysis. Patient tumor biopsies were tested for EGFR
over expression by immunohistochemistry (as described
below). Baseline imaging included either magnetic resonance images or CT scans of the chest and abdomen.
Patients attended once-weekly visits for the first 5 weeks
of therapy and once every 2 weeks thereafter. A complete
blood count was obtained at each physician clinic visit,
and serum and liver chemistries were obtained once every
4 weeks. Repeat imaging was performed at 4 weeks and
once every 8 weeks thereafter. Response was defined
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors.11 Partial responses had to be confirmed with at
least 1 follow-up imaging study or on physical examination at 4 weeks. Stable disease had to be maintained for a
minimum of 8 weeks from the initiation of protocol therapy. Toxicity was evaluated using the Cancer Therapy
Evaluation Program’ Common Toxicity Criteria (version
3.0).
Treatment
Erlotinib (OSI-774; NSC-71871) was supplied by the
National Cancer Institute (Division of Cancer Treatment
and Diagnosis, Bethesda, Md) in 25-mg, 100-mg, and
150-mg tablets. Patients self-administered 150 mg erlotinib orally once daily, 1 hour before a meal, or 2 hours after
a meal. Patients also could dissolve the tablets in 100 mL
of distilled water and administer the drug orally or
through a feeding tube. Patients were required to take either an H2-receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor for ulcer prophylaxis. Patients continued therapy until
they developed either disease progression or unacceptable
toxicity. Dose reductions for toxicity or therapy delay
because of toxicity were permitted to 100 mg, 50 mg, or
25 mg. Therapy was held for grade 3 or 4 toxicity, including skin rash, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, or
neutropenia/thrombocytopenia. Therapy was held until
toxicity resolved to grade 1, and treatment was resumed
at a 1 dose-level reduction. Patients could continue

therapy for up to grade 2 diarrhea or skin rash if the toxicity was manageable with supportive medications; if therapy was held for grade 2 skin rash or diarrhea, then
treatment could be resumed at the same dose level. For
treatment delay because of recurrent grade 2 skin rash or
diarrhea, a 1 dose-level reduction was made. Therapy
delay beyond 2 weeks for toxicity mandated withdrawal
from the study unless a clinical benefit from therapy
(response or stable disease) could be demonstrated.
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
Expression Analysis
Immunohistochemistry for EGFR was performed using
the Dako EGFR Immunohistochemistry Detection System (EGFR PharmDx test; Dako, Carpinteria, Calif) and
standard immunohistochemical techniques, as reported
previously.12 Immunoexpression was graded based on the
percentage of tumor cells that had strong membranous
staining as 0 (<10% of tumor cells stained), 1þ (10%35% of tumor cells stained), 2þ (35%-65% of tumor cells
stained), or 3þ (>65% of tumor cells stained). For the
purposes of data analysis, tumors that had from 1þ to
3þ staining were classified as positive.
Evaluation of Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor Mutation
With the publication of results from a study in nonsmall
cell lung cancer indicating the potential impact of EGFR
mutation on the effectiveness of EGFR TKIs,13 during
the course of the current study, we attempted to retrieve
additional tissue specimens to determine EGFR mutation
status. This was possible for only 5 of 30 the patients in
our study, because patients had died, were lost to followup, or no longer had tissue specimens available. Formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were obtained
from institutional repositories. Routinely stained tissue
sections were used to determine the area of highest tumor
cellularity for DNA preparation. Then, tumor tissue was
microdissected, and genomic DNA was isolated from
these tissues using standard techniques. By using previously specified polymerase chain reaction primers, exons
18, 19, and 21 of EGFR were sequenced directly using the
BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) and an ABI 3730 automated
capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems).13
Study Design and Statistical Analysis
The primary study endpoint was the response rate (partial
or complete response) to treatment with erlotinib.

Cancer

April 1, 2011

Patients were divided into 2 cohorts that were studied separately: those who had EGFR-negative immunohistochemistry results and those who had EGFR-positive
immunohistochemistry results. Twelve patients per
cohort entered at the first stage, and accrual to a cohort
was stopped if no responses were observed. If 1 response
was observed, then accrual of an additional 12 patients to
a total of 24 patients per cohort was permitted. Further
study was to be recommended if 2 of 24 patients
responded per cohort. If the true response rate for erlotinib was 20%, then there was a 90% chance that this trial
design would lead to a recommendation of erlotinib for
further study.
Secondary endpoints were to evaluate the response
rate by tumor histology (adenocarcinoma vs squamous
cell carcinoma), toxicity, time to progression, and overall
survival. Overall survival and progression-free survival
probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and survival curves were compared using the logrank test. The Fisher exact test was used to assess associations between EGFR expression, histology, and response.

RESULTS
Patients
From July 2002 through September 2005, 40 patients
were screened for protocol therapy and had testing for
EGFR over expression: Thirty of those patients tested
positive for over expression (75%), including 17 of 26
patients with adenocarcinoma (65%) and 13 of 14
patients with squamous cell carcinoma (93%). Ten
patients never initiated protocol therapy because of either
ineligibility or rapid clinical decline before protocol entry.
In total, 30 patients were accrued on study, and all were
evaluable for toxicity and response. Because 1 response
was observed in the EGFR over expressing cohort, the
sample was expanded to a total of 24 patients. Accrual to
the EGFR-negative cohort was slow given the rarity of
EGFR-negative patients, and accrual to the cohort was
terminated after no responses were observed in 6 patients
who received treatment.
Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1.
The majority of patients were men (70%) with adenocarcinoma (57%), and most adenocarcinomas were located
in the gastroesophageal junction (59%). Over expression
of EGFR was observed in 24 patients (80%), including 12
patients with adenocarcinoma (71%) and 12 patients
with squamous cancer (92%). The majority of patients
had lymph node metastases (87%), and the second and

third most common sites of metastases were the liver
(27%) and the lungs (23%). All but 1 patient previously
had received chemotherapy either in the adjuvant setting
(70%), or for advanced disease (40%), or both (13%).
The majority of patients previously had received combined chemoradiotherapy (67%), and 50% previously
had undergone esophagectomy. The median Karnofsky
performance status was 80%. Most patients (90%) were
current or former smokers.
Treatment Outcome
Two responses were observed in the EGFR over expressing cohort (8%), and no responses were observed among
the 6 patients in the EGFR-negative cohort (P ¼ .6). The

1412

2 responses were observed among the 13 patients who had
squamous cell carcinoma (15%; 95% confidence interval,
0%-34%), and no responses were observed among the 17
patients who had with adenocarcinoma (P ¼ .20). The
durations of the 2 responses were 7 months and 5.5
months. The responses were observed in patients with
lymph node disease that involved the neck and the mediastinum. The responses occurred in 1 patient who had
received prior preoperative chemoradiotherapy, surgery,
and chemotherapy for recurrent disease and in 1 patient
who had received prior chemoradiotherapy for unresectable disease. Both responders were former smokers, 1 man
and 1 woman, although, in 1 patient, the smoking history
was remote. Although an equal number of patients who
had squamous cancer had stable disease (7 of 13 patients;
54%) compared with patients who had adenocarcinoma
(8 of 17 patients; 47%), the duration of stable disease in
the patients who had squamous cancer (median, 5
months; range, 2-24 months) was longer compared with
that of patients who had adenocarcinoma (median, 3.5
months; range, 2-6 months).
The time to disease progression was greater in
patients with squamous cancer (median, 3.3 months)
than in patients with adenocarcinoma (median, 1.6 months;
P ¼ .026). Five patients had protracted stable disease,
including 1 patient with adenocarcinoma (6 months) and
4 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (8 months, 9
months, 12 months, and 24 months). There was no correlation with skin toxicity and the achievement of either stable
disease or partial response, and the 2 partial responses were
observed in patients who had grade 1 rash. There also was no
correlation between the degree of EGFR expression (negative
vs positive or 1 vs 2 vs 3þ) and achieving either a response or
stable disease (data not shown), although the 2 responders
were in the EGFR-positive cohort. The median survival was
10.3 months for all patients, 8.2 months for patients with
squamous cell cancer, and 11.2 months for patients with adenocarcinoma (P ¼ .75).
Toxicity
Most toxicities were grade 1 or 2 with the exception of
dermatologic toxicity or skin rash, which was grade 3 in
10% of patients and grade 1 or 2 in 67% of patients. The
worst diarrhea was grade 2 in 13% of patients. Six patients
(20%) required a dose reduction to 100 mg daily, including 5 reductions for skin rash and 1 reduction for diarrhea. No patients were taken off therapy because of drug
toxicity: Therapy was stopped only if patients experienced
disease progression.

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
Mutation Analysis
No mutations in exons 18, 19, or 21 of the EGFR were
observed in the 5 patient tumor samples that were tested,
including 1 patient with squamous cell carcinoma who
had a partial response.

DISCUSSION
In the current trial, we observed partial responses to the
oral EGFR TKI erlotinib in patients with metastatic
esophageal cancer who had EGFR over expression.
Responses were observed in 15% of patients with squamous cancers of the esophagus, and we observed that
nearly 33% of patients with squamous cancers had protracted stable disease that was sustained for between 8
months and 24 months. However, no clear conclusion
can be made about the impact of EGFR expression from
the current results, because only 6 patients with EGFRnegative tumors were treated on study. No responses were
observed among 17 patients with adenocarcinoma, and
nearly 50% of those patients had progressed at the time of
their first CT scan. EGFR over expression occurred to a
lesser degree in adenocarcinomas (70%) compared with
squamous cancers (92%). In the limited analysis of 5
patients for mutation of the EGFR, no mutations were
observed, including 1 patient with squamous cancer who
achieved a partial response. No correlation of either
response or stable disease with skin rash was observed.
How do these results compare with other recent trials of EGFR TKIs in esophageal cancer? Our results are in
close agreement with the study reported by Janmaat
et al.14 In that study, gefitinib 500 mg daily was given to
36 patients, all of whom had received prior chemotherapy, including 26 patients with adenocarcinoma and 9
patients with squamous cancer. A response was observed
only in patients who had squamous cancer; and higher
rates of response and stable disease were observed among
women, among patients with squamous cancers, and
among patients with higher EGFR expression (3þ). K-ras
mutation, which recently was identified as a potential
marker of EGFR therapy resistance,15 was identified in
only 2 of 23 patients who were tested (9%), both of
whom had early progressive disease on therapy. No EGFR
mutations were identified in 26 patients who were tested.
High EGFR copy numbers were observed in 2 patients,
including 1 responder and 1 nonresponder.
In contrast to our study, Dragovich et al16 observed
significant responses in 43 patients with adenocarcinoma
Cancer

of the gastroesophageal junction who received erlotinib
150 mg daily. Patients on that trial had no received prior
treatment for metastatic disease; in contrast, 53% of
patients on our study had received prior chemotherapy for
advanced disease. Dragovich et al reported 4 responses
(9%), and stable disease was observed in 5 patients (12%).
However, the median time on that study was only 2
months, indicating that the majority of patients had rapid
disease progression. The authors did not comment on the
characteristics of the responding patients. Potential predictive molecular markers of response were assessed,
including EGFR mutation (none found) and amplification of EGFR (none found). Positive immunohistochemical staining for EGFR, phosphorylated AKT, and
transforming growth factor-a was observed in the majority of samples that they tested, and there were no correlations with response. In another positive trial, Ferry et al17
evaluated gefitinib 500 mg daily in 26 patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction and observed 3 responses (12%), including 1 patient
who received no previous therapy, 1 patient who received
previous adjuvant chemotherapy, and 1 patient who
received previous chemotherapy for advanced disease.
Most patients, however, also had rapid disease progression
(median time to progression, 1.9 months). In a separate
report,18 the same authors reported the evaluation EGFR
mutations in a cohort of 17 patients with adenocarcinoma
and identified 2 patients who had mutations (12%); both
of these patients were treated with gefitinib and failed to
respond. One patient with EGFR amplification who was
treated on that study responded to treatment.
Collectively, the data for EGFR TKIs suggest limited single-agent activity in esophageal cancer, and most
patients experienced early disease progression. The median survival of 11.2 months for the patients with adenocarcinoma on our trial, despite rapid progression of
disease on erlotinib, indicates a benefit from salvage treatment with further chemotherapy, and our patient survival
exceeded reports from other trials, in which the median
survival was only 4.5 months to 6.7 months. Although
data on EGFR TKIs for adenocarcinoma of the distal
esophagus and gastroesophageal junction appear to be
conflicting, the data from our trial and others suggest a
consistent signal of activity for EGFR TKIs in esophageal
squamous cancer. Our observation not only of responses
but also of protracted stable disease extending from 1 or 2
years supports the study of erlotinib as a potential adjuvant therapy in squamous cancer. However, to date, combining erlotinib with chemotherapeutic agents has failed

1413

Original Article

to improve outcomes compared with chemotherapy alone
in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer.19,20 Currently,
some investigators are evaluating alternative dosing and
scheduling of these agents with chemotherapy in nonsmall
cell lung cancer.
From the trials of TKIs in esophageal cancer, no
clear molecular marker has been identified that is predictive of response to therapy, including K-ras or EGFR
mutation, with the possible exception of either EGFR
gene amplification or increased copy numbers of the
EGFR gene, which were observed in 2 responding
patients. In our series, tissue study was limited to EGFR
expression, and the majority of patients with squamous
cell and adenocarcinoma were over expressers; the limited
number of EGFR-negative patients accrued on our trial
limited any conclusions about the efficacy of erlotinib in
this patient subset. In other series, both K-ras mutations
and EGFR mutations were observed rarely, if ever, in
esophageal cancer; thus, it is unlikely that these markers
will have any significant application in this disease. This
contrasts with the important role of K-ras mutation in
identifying resistance to EGFR-targeted agents in colorectal and nonsmall cell lung cancers and EGFR mutation
in determining benefit for treatment with EGFR TKIs in
nonsmall cell lung cancer. More promise in targeting the
EGFR pathway in esophageal cancer may come from
monoclonal antibodies that can block the binding of
ligands to the receptor. Encouraging response rates and
time to tumor progression have been reported from phase
2 trials in esophageal cancer that combined antibodies like
cetuximab with combination chemotherapy.21
