BACKGROUND. Assessing the outcome of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by using conventional criteria is difficult, particularly when clinical and
radiologic worsening coincides with neutrophil recovery. Usually, it is assumed
that this deterioration is related to progressive aspergillosis, prompting changes
in patient management. However, its temporal relation with neutrophil recovery
suggests that it may be caused by an immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS).
Galactomannan is an Aspergillus-specific polysaccharide that is released during
aspergillosis and is detected by the serum galactomannan test, which has been
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis of

RESULTS. Nineteen neutropenic patients with aspergillosis developed clinical and
radiologic pulmonary deterioration during neutrophil recovery. Deterioration
coincided with microbiologic response, as documented by rapid normalization of
serum galactomannan, and, in 16 patients, was followed by complete clinical
response and survival at 3 months, although there were no changes in antifungal
therapy. The 3 patients who died during the first month had no evidence of
aspergillosis at autopsy examination.

CONCLUSIONS. The authors propose that IRIS was responsible for the current findings and provide a definition for the syndrome. They also recommend serial galactomannan testing to guide aspergillosis management. Declining galactomannan
values imply IRIS with an aspergillus response and obviate the need for invasive
procedures and alternative antifungal therapies, whereas persistent galactomannan
elevation indicates progressive aspergillosis and requires prompt treatment modification. Cancer 2007;110:112–20.  2007 American Cancer Society.

nvasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a life-threatening infection in
patients with hematologic malignancies who are undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy.1 Phagocytic cells (neutrophils and the
macrophage/monocyte system) are the key immune defenses against
aspergillosis, as demonstrated previously by experimental studies,2
which showed the increased susceptibility of neutropenic patients to

aspergillosis and a strong relation between aspergillosis outcome and the resolution of neutropenia.3 Two
studies reported on 11 patients who had worsening
clinical and radiologic pulmonary findings after neutrophil recovery.4,5 Typically, this deterioration is considered progressive aspergillosis6 and prompts
invasive diagnostic procedures and treatment modifications, such as the use of cytokines, granulocyte
transfusions and/or surgery, and the addition of new
antifungal agents.6,7 For example, Caillot et al.
described a 4-fold increase in infiltrate size coinciding
with neutrophil recovery among 25 patients who had
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. On the assumption
that they had refractory aspergillosis, patients underwent modification of antifungal therapy and surgery.7
Similar patients usually are enrolled in salvage trials
of antifungal therapy in which refractory aspergillosis
is defined as progression of clinical or radiographic
signs despite 7 days of standard antifungal therapy.6
Pivotal trials continue to use this enrollment strategy8
despite its major pitfalls, as reported by Almyroudis
et al.6 We propose that the temporal association of
pulmonary deterioration with neutrophil recovery, in
fact, may be caused by the restored ability to mount
an inflammatory response, in a manner reminiscent
of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
(IRIS) in patients with the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) who respond to highly active antiretroviral
therapy (HAART).9,10 In the latter population, the diagnosis of IRIS is supported by new symptoms consistent with an infectious/inflammatory condition
that is related temporally to the initiation of HAART
and a robust decrease in the HIV-RNA level, which is
a pathogen-specific, reproducible, and quantitative
test.9,10 In contrast, the assessment of aspergillosis
response still relies on unvalidated, complex, composite endpoints (clinical, radiologic, and rarely histologic
or microbiologic), which mostly are nonpathogenspecific, qualitative, and observer-dependent.11 The
United States Food and Drug Administrationapproved diagnostic test for aspergillosis is based on
galactomannan, an Aspergillus-specific polysaccharide that is released during invasive infection. The test
is reported as a galactomannan index, is quantitative
and reproducible,12 and appears to correlate with
aspergillosis burden and outcome.13,14
Herein, we report the development of IRIS in cancer patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
who were recovering from neutropenia and offer a
galactomannan-based strategy to distinguish responding pulmonary aspergillosis with IRIS from progressive aspergillosis. We also describe the incidence,
clinical and radiologic findings, and favorable outcome of patients with aspergillosis-related IRIS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences from November 2003 to
September 2006 and was approved by the Institutional Review Board. The medical records of 67
patients with 2 consecutive positive galactomannan
indices (optical density 0.5) were reviewed; 22
patients were excluded, including 14 patients who
were receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and 8 patients
who did not undergo optimal radiologic testing and/
or follow-up. In addition, 13 cancer patients with
pulmonary aspergillosis who were cared for at the
University Hospital Gasthuisberg (Leuven, Belgium)
from April 2001 to December 2006 and who met our
inclusion criteria were identified, and their medical
records were reviewed.
Galactomannan testing was performed and
reported according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Platelia Aspergillus EIA; Bio-Rad, Redmond, WA).
Sera with an index 0.5 were retested the next day
and were considered positive if the galactomannan
index was 0.5.
Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000 cells/lL. Invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis was defined according to European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/
Mycoses Study Group criteria.15 Successful outcome
was defined as a persistently negative galactomannan
index with survival at 3 months in the absence of
new extrapulmonary lesions of aspergillosis (eg, a
culture-positive skin lesion and/or a skin lesion with
hyphal tissue invasion consistent with aspergillosis)
or a negative autopsy for aspergillosis in the event of
death. Failure was defined as a persistently positive
galactomannan index and/or death, unless autopsy
examination failed to reveal aspergillosis.
Pulmonary IRIS was defined as a new onset of or
worsening clinical and radiologic pulmonary findings
consistent with an infectious/inflammatory pulmonary condition temporally related to neutrophil
recovery with evidence of microbiologic response (a
decrease 50% in serum galactomannan index titers
on 2 consecutive tests within 4 days of each other)
despite no change in antifungal therapy. The definition also required absence of new extrapulmonary
lesions of aspergillosis (eg, new skin lesions as
described above) and/or other processes, such as
newly acquired infection, failure of treatment of a
known infection, or medication side effects.

RESULTS
Nineteen neutropenic patients with proven/probable
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis fulfilled the IRIS criteria, including 11 patients with acute leukemia (58%), 6

patients with myeloma (32%), and 1 patient each with
non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic myelogenous
leukemia. The median patient age was 56 years (range,
18–73 years), and there were 12 men and 7 women
(Table 1). Aspergillosis developed after stem cell transplantation (autologous in 4 patients and allogeneic in
3 patients) or after conventional chemotherapy (12
patients). The mean days to clinical and radiologic
findings of IRIS after an ANC >100/lL and an ANC
>500/lL was 3.5 days (median, 3 days; range, from 7
days to 18 days) and 2 days (median, 1 day; range,
from 8 days to 115 days), respectively. Clinical deterioration included worsening or new onset of hypoxia
requiring oxygen therapy (12 patients), including mechanical ventilation in 4 patients, cough (8 patients),
chest pain (6 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), and
hemoptysis (3 patients). Radiologic findings consisted
of increasing and/or new onset pulmonary infiltrates
in 14 patients, pleural effusions in 10 patients, nodular
lesions in 9 patients, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy
in 3 patients, and cavitation in 1 patient. At diagnosis,
all 19 patients had 2 consecutive positive serum
galactomannan tests, prompting the initiation of antimould therapy. Declining titers of sequential serum
galactomannan were observed during clinical and
radiologic deterioration.
Three patients died during the first month of follow-up (Patients 12, 14, and 16); autopsies on those
3 patients failed to demonstrate invasive aspergillosis. At 1-month follow-up, the remaining 16 patients
improved without changes in antifungal therapy or
additional therapies, such as cytokines or surgery; at
3 months, all 16 patients were alive without clinical,
radiologic, or microbiologic evidence of aspergillosis.
The serum Aspergillus galactomannan index was also
negative. It is noteworthy that 2 patients with myeloma (Patients 1 and 5) received intravenous
methylprednisone for impending respiratory failure.

DISCUSSION
Several new findings emerge from this study. First, we
provide a proof of principle for pulmonary IRIS among
patients with hematologic cancer and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis who are recovering from neutropenia. The immune-related nature of the pulmonary
deterioration is supported by 1) the temporal association with neutrophil recovery, 2) the robust microbiologic response (decrease in galactomannan index
titers), 3) the absence of new lesions from aspergillosis
or other processes, 4) the subsequent resolution of
aspergillosis without treatment modifications (confirming that the deterioration was not related to progressive aspergillosis), and 5) the improved outcome

after methylprednisone in 2 patients with impending
respiratory failure (providing further support for the
immune-related nature of this syndrome).
Worsening of pulmonary findings of aspergillosis
during neutrophil recovery has been reported among
patients with hematologic cancer4,7 but almost always
was considered evidence of progressive infection.
However, because of the absence of microbiologic
documentation in those reports, it remains unclear
whether patients had resolving aspergillosis with IRIS
or progressive infection. In another report, 3 patients
with pulmonary aspergillosis developed respiratory
failure during neutrophil recovery; 2 of those patients
responded to methylprednisone without changes in
antifungal therapy, suggesting that deterioration was
related to the resolution of neutropenia.4 Our data
support the latter findings and now provide evidence,
for the first time, that pulmonary deterioration can be
immune-related with infection response and not refractory aspergillosis.11 Indeed, patients who have worsening clinical and radiologic findings always are
considered to have progressive infection, prompting
changes in their management. Then, the subsequent
clinical and radiologic improvements are considered
proof of efficacy of this agent (often leading to regulatory approval), without any consideration for the possibility that deterioration leading to enrollment, in
fact, may be aspergillosis-related IRIS with response
occurring prior to investigational therapy.
The incidence of HIV-associated IRIS is from 10%
to 25%,9 and pulmonary IRIS has been associated with
various pathogens, including Aspergillus spp.16 HIVassociated IRIS appears to develop later (mean,  33
days; range, 8–150 days after HAART)9 than among
our patients (mean, 2 days; range, from 8 days to
115 days after the resolution of neutropenia). It
remains to be determined whether IRIS in our patients
was caused by neutrophil recovery only or by the
combined effect of recovery and antifungal therapy.
Second, we provide a definition of pulmonary IRIS
among cancer patients that was adapted from the definition proposed for patients with HIV10 (Table 2).
Similar to the definition of HIV-IRIS, our definition is
clinical, includes a microbiologic marker of response
(serum galactomannan index), but also requires measuring the key immune parameter in aspergillosis
among neutropenic patients, ie, the neutrophil count.
Third, we describe the clinical and radiologic
spectrum of IRIS in 19 cancer patients with pulmonary
aspergillosis who were recovering from neutropenia
and report that IRIS may not be uncommon among
such patients. Fourth, our data suggest that cancer
patients with pulmonary aspergillosis and IRIS may
have a good prognosis, similar to that for HIV-infected

* Patients 12, 14, and 16 died during the first month of follow-up; in those 3 patients, autopsies failed to demonstrate invasive aspergillosis. At 1 month of follow-up, the remaining 16 patients improved without changes in antifungal therapy; at 3 months, all patients were alive without
clinical, radiologic, or microbiologic evidence of aspergillosis. The serum Aspergillus galactomannan index also was negative.
y
Pulmonary IRIS was defined as new onset or worsening of clinical and radiologic pulmonary findings consistent with an infectious/inflammatory pulmonary condition temporally related to neutrophil recovery and a decrease 50% in serum GMI titers (2 consecutive tests within 4
days) in the absence of new extrapulmonary lesions of aspergillosis (eg, the aforementioned new skin lesions) and after excluding other causes, such as newly acquired infection, failure of treatment of a known infection, or medication side effects.

patients in whom IRIS was associated with successful
immune reconstitution, decreasing HIV viral load, and
a trend toward increased survival.17 Additional experience will be needed to confirm our findings, because
it is likely that some patients with invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis and IRIS may not survive in face of overwhelming respiratory deterioration.
Our findings imply that pulmonary deterioration
among cancer patients with invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis who are recovering from neutropenia
does not necessarily indicate progressive aspergillosis, particularly when such deterioration coincides
with a robust decrease in aspergillus antigenemia.
Such patients should be continued on the same therapy with consideration for a 3- to 7-day course of
corticosteroids (eg, 2 mg/kg methylprednisone per
day) for the occasional patient with impending respiratory failure (Table 1). Corticosteroids have been
used successfully in HIV-positive patients who had
IRIS associated with various opportunistic infections.17,18 In contrast, persistently elevated galactomannan titers suggest progressive aspergillosis and
should prompt treatment modification. Hence, we
recommend serial serum galactomannan testing in
patients with pulmonary deterioration. Work-up to
exclude other infections may be needed, although
breakthrough infections are least likely during neutrophil recovery. The current findings also imply that
clinical trials of progressive aspergillosis should rely
on serial galactomannan testing and should exclude

patients who have resolving antigenemia and no
other evidence of progressive aspergillosis.
Our study should be confirmed by others and
broadened to include other populations at risk.1,3 A
prospective validation of our definition also is needed.
We conclude that pulmonary IRIS may develop
among patients with invasive aspergillosis and hematologic cancers who are recovering from neutropenia.
Serial galactomannan testing is critical to distinguish
this syndrome from progressive aspergillosis. This
strategy is likely to improve patient outcomes and to
enhance the precision of trials that investigate treatment strategies for aspergillosis.
