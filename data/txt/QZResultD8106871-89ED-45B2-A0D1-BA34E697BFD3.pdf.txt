Abstract
Patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) experience
significant morbidity such as complete hearing loss. We have recently shown that treatment with bevacizumab provided tumor stabilization and hearing recovery in a subset of NF2 patients with progressive disease. In
the current study, we used two animal models to identify the mechanism of action of anti–vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) therapy in schwannomas. The human HEI193 and murine Nf 2−/− cell lines were implanted between the pia and arachnoid meninges as well as in the sciatic nerve to mimic central and peripheral schwannomas. Mice were treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg/wk i.v.) or vandetanib (50 mg/kg/d orally)
to block the VEGF pathway. Using intravital and confocal microscopy, together with whole-body imaging, we
measured tumor growth delay, survival rate, as well as blood vessel structure and function at regular intervals.
In both models, tumor vessel diameter, length/surface area density, and permeability were significantly reduced after treatment. After 2 weeks of treatment, necrosis in HEI193 tumors and apoptosis in Nf 2−/− tumors
were significantly increased, and the tumor growth rate decreased by an average of 50%. The survival of mice
bearing intracranial schwannomas was extended by at least 50%. This study shows that anti-VEGF therapy
normalizes the vasculature of schwannoma xenografts in nude mice and successfully controls the tumor
growth, probably by reestablishing a natural balance between VEGF and semaphorin 3 signaling. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant
inherited disorder characterized by the development of multiple schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas (1). Although most patients with sporadic schwannomas benefit
from surgery and radiation therapy (2), NF2 patients have
limited options due to the multiplicity and bilateral location
of their tumors (3). Vestibular schwannomas are particularly
challenging surgically due to the potential for brainstem or
cranial nerve damage. Currently, there are no curative treatments and bilateral hearing loss is unfortunately common in
patients affected by NF2.

Schwannomas, like other tumors, recruit blood vessels to
sustain their growth. Indeed, a number of small studies
have previously reported expression of the main angiogenic
factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in
schwannomas (4–7), a finding confirmed by our own analysis of a series of NF2-related and sporadic schwannomas
at the Massachusetts General Hospital (8). The activity of
VEGF is mostly mediated via two classes of receptors:
the tyrosine kinases VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 and the neuropilins NRP1 and NRP2 (9, 10). The activity of VEGF in the
peripheral nervous system is modulated by semaphorins,
which are negative regulators that act through the neuropilin receptors (9–11).
Targeting the ligand, VEGF itself (12, 13), or blocking
VEGF receptor activity (14–17) has led to some success
in treating various cancers, including malignant gliomas.
Antiangiogenic therapy has only recently been used to
treat benign tumors that are generally thought to be resistant to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. But in a recent
study of 10 consecutive patients with bilateral vestibular
schwannoma, we showed that anti-VEGF therapy results
in improvement of hearing and stabilization of tumor
growth (8). However, the retrospective nature of this study
did not allow determination of the mechanism of action.
We therefore developed two animal models of schwannoma to perform longitudinal studies of tumor growth. By

using two therapeutic approaches, we show that targeting
the VEGF pathway by blocking either VEGF or its main
receptor (VEGFR2) can lead to tumor control and improved overall survival by decreasing permeability and
inducing tumor cell death. Furthermore, we present evidence that loss of semaphorin by the Nf 2−/− Schwann cell
is responsible for shifting the balance between semaphorin
and VEGF, leading ultimately to a proangiogenic state.

Materials and Methods
Chemical reagents and antibodies
Vandetanib [a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of
VEGFR2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a
generous gift from AstraZeneca; ref. 18] was dissolved in
DMSO for in vitro studies and in 1% Tween 80 (5 mg/mL)
for in vivo studies. Bevacizumab (a humanized antibody to
VEGF, obtained from Massachusetts General Hospital Pharmacy)
was diluted with PBS (10 mg/mL) before use in animals.
The following antibodies were used: phosphorylated EGFR
(P-EGFR; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated
AKR mouse T-cell lymphoma oncogene (P-AKT; 1:1,000; Cell
Signaling Technology), phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase (P-ERK; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology),
EGFR (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), AKT (1:1,000; Cell
Signaling Technology), ERK1 (clone MK12, 1:1,000; BD
Transduction Laboratories), and merlin (1:1,000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Recombinant mouse VEGF was obtained
from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) via a materials
transfer agreement and recombinant human EGF was
obtained from R&D Systems.
Cell lines
Human HEI193 (a gift from Dr. Xandra Breakefield
[Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA]; refs. 19, 20)
schwannoma cells were maintained in DMEM (Cellgro
Mediatech) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 1× N2 (Invitrogen),
14 ng/mL glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor, and
2 μmol/L forskolin (20). Murine Nf 2−/− tumor Schwann cells
were generated along the following guide lines: pure populations of embryonic Schwann cells were isolated from
Nf 2loxP/loxP− mice at embryonic day 13.5. The cells were
then infected in vitro with an adenovirus expressing Cre
recombinase to allow excision of exon 2 and thereby disruption of the Nf 2 locus. The cells were injected in nude mice in
the subcutaneous space in the flank, and the resulting tumor
was harvested and dissociated. The resulting single-cell
suspension was placed in culture to generate the first “line”
used for all experiments in this study. Nf 2−/− cells were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 100 ng/mL recombinant human neuregulin-β1 (PeproTech) and 5 μmol/L
forskolin (Invitrogen).
Animal models
To recapitulate as closely as possible the microenvironment of vestibular schwannomas (intracranial but arising
from a cranial nerve), we modified the previously published

3484

Cancer Res; 70(9) May 1, 2010

model for gliomas (21). In brief, Nf 2−/− or HEI193 cells were
implanted between the pia and arachnoid meninges in
nude mice (8 weeks old) bearing transparent cranial windows and allowed to reach 2-mm diameter (approximately
6 and 11 days for Nf 2−/− and HEI193 cells, respectively) before initiation of treatment. In the second model, we reproduced the nerve microenvironment using the mouse sciatic
nerve. This environment had previously been shown to be
suitable for schwannoma growth (22). To mimic the clinical
situation where treatment would be initiated when tumor
volume is already significant (between 2 and 20 cm3), we
started treating the sciatic nerve tumors after they were
macroscopically visible (7 days for Nf 2−/− and 4–5 weeks
for HEI193 following implantation). In both models, approximately a million cells were injected with a 28.5-gauge
needle to generate schwannomas.
To capitalize on the advantages of each model, we used
the cranial window models to study kinetic changes in vessel
(diameter and permeability) and overall survival, whereas the
peripheral implantation was used to study growth kinetics
and vessel morphology (number and maturation state of vessels, and apoptosis and proliferation of endothelial cells).
Due to the species specificity of bevacizumab, the Nf 2 murine model was treated with the TKI vandetanib, whereas the
human HEI193 model was treated with bevacizumab. In the
peripheral model, HEI193 was treated with both regimens.
Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy angiography
and vessel morphometry quantification
Intracranially implanted tumors were allowed to grow for
6 days (Nf2−/− cells) or 11 days (HEI193 cells) before treatment
with vandetanib at 50 mg/kg/d orally or bevacizumab at
10 mg/kg/wk i.v., respectively. At time points of interest, mice
were anesthetized with 0.3 mL ketamine/xylazine, and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) angiography of
blood vessels was performed following i.v. injection of
0.1 mL FITC-dextran (2 million molecular weight; Sigma)
at 10 mg/mL. Three-dimensional profiles (200-μm stacks)
of the tumor vasculature were collected before as well as 1
and 6 days after treatment. A vessel-tracing algorithm was
used to quantify vessel diameter, length density, and surface
area density of each angiograph (23).
Blood vessel permeability measurement
Changes in vessel permeability during anti-VEGF therapy
were measured in tumors grown in the cranium. Nf 2−/− or
HEI193 cells were infected with green fluorescent protein
(GFP) retroviruses for visual tracking of tumor volume within
the cranial window. Measurement of the effective vascular
permeability was performed as described previously (24). In
brief, GFP-expressing tumor cells were first located, and the
fluorescence intensity of rhodamine within the tumor tissue
was measured every 2 minutes for 24 minutes after injection
of 0.1 mL tetramethylrhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin (rho-BSA; 10 mg/mL). Permeability of the vessels to albumin was calculated as P = (1 − HT) V/S [1/(I0 − Ib)*dI/dt + 1/K],
where I is the average fluorescence intensity of the whole image, I0 is the value of I immediately after the filling of all vessels

by rho-BSA, and Ib is the background fluorescence intensity.
The average hematocrit (HT) of tumor vessels was estimated
to be 19%. V and S are the total volume and surface area of
vessels within the tissue volume covered by the surface image,
respectively. The time constant of BSA plasma clearance (K) is
9.1 × 103 seconds (24).
Whole-body imaging
Longitudinal studies to investigate the effect of anti-VEGF
therapies on modulating size of Nf 2−/− and HEI193 schwannomas within the sciatic nerve were performed using the
whole-body imaging system from Xenogen (IVIS Lumina
II). Tumor cells were first infected with lentiviruses expressing firefly luciferase (mCherry; provided by Dr. Xandra
Breakefield). Tumor cells (∼1 million cells) stably expressing
luciferase were implanted into the sciatic nerve of 8-weekold nude mice. Bioluminescence intensity was first measured
2 and 30 days after implantation of Nf 2−/− and HEI193, and
bioluminescence was then measured every 2 days for the
next 2 weeks to follow tumor growth. To image tumors,
D-luciferin at 33 mg/mL was injected i.p. Five minutes after
injection, bioluminescence images were collected for a
length of 20 minutes. Data were analyzed with Living Image
software version 3.0.4, retaining the same region of interest
for all tumors within a given experiment. The total photon
flux per second was compared for each tumor accordingly.
Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from Nf 2−/− or HEI193 cells
using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was digested using
the RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) to ensure the complete
removal of DNA contamination. The amount of total
RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm (NanoDrop).
Five hundred nanograms of RNA from each sample were
transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript III RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed in a thermal cycler (Dyad). PCR products were then resolved in a 2% agarose gel by electrophoresis, and DNA images were captured with the U.V.
transilluminator (Bio-Rad). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (Gapdh) gene was amplified in each PCR
experiment as an internal loading control.
Western blot analysis
Cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed in an appropriate
volume of lysis buffer. Protein concentration was measured
with bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Appropriate volumes of
protein lysates were then mixed with 4× SDS gel-loading buffer, boiled at 100°C for 5 minutes, and resolved in 4% to 12%
gradient polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45 μm; Thermo Scientific), and the membrane
was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS with Tween 20 for
1 hour. Blots were then incubated with appropriately diluted
primary and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies, each for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, blots

www.aacrjournals.org

were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence solutions
and exposed onto HyBlot CL (Denville Scientific).
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfusion fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS
(25). Perfused tumors were extracted, postfixed in formaldehyde at 4°C for 4 to 5 hours, and incubated with 30% sucrose
overnight at 4°C with constant rocking. Brain or sciatic nerve
tumors were then embedded in OCT freezing medium and
frozen for sectioning. Sections (10 μm thick) were first air
dried for 30 minutes at room temperature and postfixed with
acetone for 5 minutes at −20°C. Individual stains were performed using the following antibodies: CD31 (1:150; Chemicon), platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ;
1:100; eBioscience), desmin (1:300; DAKO), and collagen IV
(1:2,000; Chemicon). Detection was carried out using secondary antibodies (or streptavidin) labeled with fluorophores
with different wavelengths (FITC, Cy3, and Cy5). For apoptosis, the ApopTag kit (Invitrogen) was used according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. Confocal images were acquired using a FluoView 500 confocal microscope (Olympus).
A constant surface area (0.4 mm2) was imaged in all cases.
Quantification of perivascular cells and basement
membrane coverage
Quantification of the stained area was performed using an
in-house segmentation algorithm (26). Analysis of basement
membrane thickness was performed by fitting the fraction
of collagen IV–stained area at a range of distances (1–15 μm)
from the vessel wall (determined by CD31 staining segmentation). The profile away from the vessel wall was fit to an exponential decay function (F = Ae−x/L + C), where F = fraction
of collagen IV–positive area at distance x from the vessels,
x = distance from vessels (1–10 μm), A = constant related
to the extent of pericyte/basement membrane coverage, and
L = characteristic length related to the distance between pericyte and the vessel wall when applied to desmin-stained tissue
and to basement membrane thickness when applied to collagen IV–stained tissue.
Statistical analysis
We used the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test for comparison between two samples. One-way ANOVA Fisher's test
followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference test was
used for multiple comparisons with a 95% confidence level.
For survival rate, we plotted the survival distribution curve
with the Kaplan-Meier method followed by log-rank testing
(XLSTAT software). We considered the difference between
comparisons to be significant when P < 0.05 for all the
statistical analysis.

models to study the effect of antiangiogenic therapy on
schwannoma tumor vessels. We used a newly established

2.5 × 106 cells were starved overnight for 12 hours with DMEM and incubated with full medium, recombinant mouse VEGF (10 ng/mL), or human EGF
(100 ng/mL) with various concentration of vandetanib or bevacizumab for 15 minutes at 37°C as indicated in the diagram. Vandetanib decreased P-EGFR,
P-AKT, and P-ERK in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas bevacizumab did not affect HEI193 signaling unless at very high concentration.
C, expression pattern for SEMA3, its receptors, and the VEGF receptors in murine wt Schwann cells and their Nf 2−/− counterpart (top) and human
Schwann cells compared with HEI193 (bottom). Loss of the Nf 2 gene is concurrent with a loss of SEMA3 (b, d, f, and g in murine, all in human), NRP1,
and VEGFR1 expression, whereas NRP2 and plexins retain their initial expression. VEGF receptors are not typically expressed by Schwann cells, and
oncogenic transformation did not seem to change this feature in vitro. D, reintroduction of the Nf 2 gene is accompanied by a reexpression of SEMA3,
NRP1, and VEGFR1, supporting the hypothesis of a link between loss of merlin and a change in balance within the angiogenic pathway.

murine cell line (Nf 2−/− Schwann cells) to recapitulate the genetic abnormality found in NF2-related vestibular schwannomas and the human cell line (HEI193 cells), which was
cultured from a schwannoma resected from a NF2 patient.
Although of different origin, both cell lines showed similarities in that they lacked wild-type (wt) merlin expression
(Fig. 1A), did not express VEGFR1 or VEGFR2, but did express
EGFR that could be phosphorylated on stimulation with recombinant EGF (Fig. 1B). In addition, both cell lines secreted
VEGF in vitro (data not shown). Furthermore, analysis of expression levels of semaphorin 3 (SEMA3A to SEMA3G) and
neuropilins (NRP1 and NRP2) in murine Schwann cells revealed a downregulation of SEMA3D, SEMA3F, SEMA3G,
and NRP1 on loss of the Nf 2 gene (Fig. 1C). Downregulation
of SEMA3A, SEMA3F, and NRP1 was also observed in HEI193
cells compared with normal human Schwann cells (Fig. 1C).

3488

Cancer Res; 70(9) May 1, 2010

Furthermore, reintroduction of Nf 2 gene in the Nf 2 −/−
Schwann cells induced reexpression not only of merlin but
also of SEMA3 and NRP1 (Fig. 1D). This combination of receptors and ligands provided a system, particularly relevant
to the peripheral nervous system, with an overall proangiogenic balance by loss of the naturally secreted inhibitor
induced by loss of Nf2 gene.
Due to the species specificity of bevacizumab to human
VEGF, the murine NF2−/− model could not be treated with
the VEGF inhibitor. However, we believe that the NF2 −/−
Schwann cells are more representative of the molecular evolution of vestibular schwannoma than HEI193 cells. For example, the NF2−/− cells lose expression of the semaphorin and
NRP1, precisely recapitulating the pattern seen in patients.
On the other hand, bevacizumab is the agent currently used
in the clinic (8, 27). We therefore took two parallel approaches

to extract an overall picture of “VEGF withdrawal” mechanisms based on the respective strengths of the two distinct
but biologically related models: administration of bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody against human VEGF, as a single
agent) or administration of vandetanib (a TKI specific to
EGFR and VEGF), which is safe in patients in phase I/II trials
(28) and efficacious in a murine model. Furthermore, EGFR
has been reported to play a critical role in Schwann cell proliferation (29–31), and treatment with an inhibitor has shown
efficacy in patients (27).
We then characterized the antitumor and antivascular effects of vandetanib and bevacizumab in vitro by stimulating
Nf 2−/− cells with recombinant EGF before adding vandetanib
or bevacizumab. There was a concentration-dependent inhibition of P-EGFR, P-AKT, and P-ERK by vandetanib but no notable pharmacologic effect by bevacizumab (Fig. 1B). These
results suggest that vandetanib likely targets both tumor cells
and host endothelium, whereas bevacizumab targets only the
endothelium in our in vivo experimental settings.
Schwannomas are vascularized; anti-VEGF therapies
decrease vessel size and number
By 10 days to 2 weeks following subdural injection of 105
tumor cells, 2-mm-diameter tumors with established vasculature were visible (Fig. 2A and B, D0 panels). Treatment of intracranial schwannomas with vandetanib (50 mg/kg/d) or
bevacizumab (10 mg/kg/wk) induced vascular changes as
early as 24 hours after the first dose (Fig. 2A and B, D1 panels).
By 6 days of treatment, both vandetanib and bevacizumab
decreased the vessel surface area (S/V) compared with

controls (34% and 33%, respectively, graphs SA density).
However, the biological pathways responsible for the decrease
were different between the two treatments. Vandetanib
resulted in a 32% decrease of the number of vessels (length density) without affecting the vessel diameter, whereas bevacizumab decreased vessel diameter by 22% as early as 24 hours
following the first injection but did not change the number
of vessels. In both cases, total vascular volume in the tumor
was significantly decreased by the 6th day of treatment.
Tumors implanted in the sciatic nerve showed similar
changes in overall microvascular density (with an initial average of 53 and 250 vessels per mm2 for HEI193 and Nf 2−/−,
respectively; see Supplementary Fig. S1) with a decrease of
50% in HEI193 (36 vessels per mm2; Fig. 2C; Supplementary
Fig. S1B) and 62% in Nf 2−/− (average of 98 vessels per mm2;
Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S1A) after treatment with bevacizumab and vandetanib, respectively. To distinguish the
response of tumor cells from that of the host endothelium,
we also treated HEI193 with vandetanib. After 6 days of treatment with vandetanib, a 50% decrease in total number of
vessels was also seen (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Blocking tumor-derived VEGF or VEGFR2 in host endothelium produced virtually the same antiangiogenic outcome.

(Fig. 3B). To determine how anti-VEGF therapy affects growth
rate, we transfected tumor cells with luciferase and followed tumor growth with a whole-body imager. Although tumors had to
be measured at a much earlier stage (due to saturation of the
signal), by day 6, vandetanib and bevacizumab resulted in 2.5and 4-fold decreases in tumor volume, respectively (Fig. 3C and
D). To further investigate the mechanism by which anti-VEGF
therapies delay schwannoma growth, we assessed tumor tissue
viability. We found that vandetanib increased apoptosis in
Nf2−/− by 6-fold (Fig. 4A), whereas necrosis was not noticeable
at the measured time points. Interestingly, instead of inducing
apoptosis, both bevacizumab and vandetanib treatment
increased the necrotic fraction in HEI193 by 3- to 4-fold
(Fig. 4B). From these data, we conclude that anti-VEGF treatment delays tumor progression by causing tumor cell death
primarily through the antivascular effect.
Overall survival. Human vestibular schwannomas can be
life threatening if they compress vital structures such as the
brain stem. Indeed, the ability of the brain to absorb increases in volume is much more limited than other organs.
In a similar fashion, tumors implanted within the cranium
of nude mice have a strong effect on their survival. KaplanMeier curves showed that inhibiting the VEGF pathway in
both schwannoma cell lines had a significant effect on
overall survival. Bevacizumab extended survival by 95% in nude
mice bearing HEI193 tumors, whereas vandetanib increased
survival by 48% in mice bearing Nf 2−/− tumors (Fig. 5).
Improved function and morphology contribute to
slower tumor growth
We recently showed that vascular permeability can play a
role in overall survival in mice bearing tumors growing within the cranium (32). Treatment of Nf 2−/− tumors with vandetanib decreased vessel permeability to BSA by 69.3% at
24 hours and by 74.9% after 6 days (Fig. 6A). Similarly, bevacizumab reduced HEI193 vessel permeability by 43%

24 hours after the first injection. Again, the effect was sustained, with permeability reduced by 51.7% 6 days after
treatment (Fig. 6B). The stronger effect seen in the murine
Nf 2−/− tumors treated with vandetanib is most likely due to
a more complete inhibition because bevacizumab is unable
to block the host-derived VEGF. In addition, EGFR can be
expressed by tumor endothelium (33) and the dual blockade
induced by vandetanib might be beneficial. These functional
changes were accompanied by morphologic changes of the
vessels. Analysis of the tumor vessels in the sciatic nerve
(the slower-growing model) showed a 40% increase in
perivascular coverage (defined as PDGFRβ-positive perivascular cells) in HEI193 tumors treated with either bevacizumab or vandetanib (Fig. 6C) and a 60% increase in
pericyte coverage in Nf 2−/− tumors that were treated with
vandetanib (Fig. 6D).
Interestingly, we did not observe changes in basement
membrane thickness (defined as collagen IV thickness)
in either cranial or sciatic nerve schwannomas (data not
shown). This is very different from the “classic” normalization seen in brain tumors treated with anti-VEGF therapies
(34). Whether the normalization mechanism (35) is different
in benign tumors or whether this observation is specific to
Schwann cells warrants further study.

Discussion
Although most cancer patients treated with anti-VEGF
monotherapy have derived some benefit in progression-free
survival, it generally has had little effect on the overall survival in malignant diseases (36). In a retrospective series of
10 patients with benign vestibular schwannomas treated
with bevacizumab, 6 of 10 patients had a radiographic response and 4 of 10 had a sustained response (at least a
20% decrease in tumor volume and/or significant improvement in word recognition; ref. 8). Six of the patients have
been on treatment for >12 months (longest treatment period: 18 months) and no grade 3 or 4 adverse events have
been reported. These promising results suggest that antiVEGF therapy might be more effective in treating benign
NF2-related tumors than for malignant disease. Thus, it is
essential to understand the biological mechanisms of
response to guide treatment properly. To this end, we
established two animal models with relevance to the
microenvironment of human tumors.
Here, we showed that inhibition of VEGF or its receptor
modified the vascular network in a sustained fashion. Independent of the tumor type or the site of tumor implantation,
the number of vessels was significantly decreased by 6 days
of treatment and the remaining vessels normalized morphologically (decreased in diameter) and functionally (increased
pericyte coverage and reduced permeability), ultimately leading to decreased tumor growth rate and increased survival.
One potential explanation for the profound response of benign tumors to anti-VEGF therapy lies in their inability to
invade the surrounding tissue. Cancer cells that cannot
migrate to co-opt host vessels are completely dependent on

vessel recruitment and, thus, more sensitive to antiangiogenic therapy.
Schwannomas typically progress slowly and are not considered to be angiogenic tumors. However, a recent review
of surgical archival specimen revealed a proangiogenic profile defined by number and size of vessels combined with
quantification of VEGF expression and SEMA3F loss (8). In
this study, we found that loss of the Nf 2 gene was accompanied by the loss of SEMA3 and that treatment with antiVEGF therapies resulted in a sustained decreased growth
rate and vessel permeability. This suggests that VEGF might
have a different effect or mechanism of action in the context
of peripheral nerve tumors.
Although permeability in schwannomas is supposed to
be of minor importance, because the eighth cranial nerve
is not within the blood-brain barrier, a blood-nerve barrier
has been shown (37). Indeed, the permeability coefficient

of various electrolytes, nonelectrolytes, perm selectivity,
and transporters between cerebral and endoneurial capillaries is very similar (38), implying that anti-VEGF therapies are very likely modulating the permeability in the
nerve as well. Therefore, controlling the extent of permeability and subsequent edema might still contribute to the
overall clinical benefits. Indeed, nerve edema is an important component of Wallerian degeneration (39). One of the
most important forms of nerve edema is induced by external compression, similar to the one that can be induced by
tumor growth (40). Control of permeability has been beneficial in improving the condition of patients with diabetic
polyneuropathy (41). It is therefore logical to hypothesize
that anti-VEGF might have a dual effect by (a) decreasing
the induction of angiogenesis, thereby slowing rate of
growth, and (b) decreasing the nerve edema, ultimately
slowing down nerve degeneration and restoring normal

physiology. These factors may explain the benefit seen in
hearing ability in patients (8).
In conclusion, Nf 2 loss increases the proliferation rate of
Schwann cells but with slow, more gradual progression
compared with malignant tumors. Schwannomas are not typically necrotic and are therefore less likely to trigger hypoxiadriven overexpression of VEGF. Instead, we propose that the
loss of merlin may result in loss of semaphorin, tipping the
angiogenic balance toward angiogenesis. The loss of neurofibromin in NF1-derived tumors has also been linked to
increased angiogenesis, but there is still relatively little information on the role of angiogenesis in NF2-derived tumors
and the putative relationship between merlin and angiogenic
pathways.
Our study supports the hypothesis that decreasing vascular supply and normalizing the remaining vessels can induce a growth delay and extend survival. The preclinical
models validated in this study could now be used to
screen potential new class of inhibitors, chosen based on
our understanding of the molecular evolution of these
tumors. We found in these benign tumors that anti-VEGF
therapy seems to follow the original hypothesis proposed
by Folkman that stopping vessel recruitment significantly
slows tumor growth. However, there is still a lack of
understanding of the angiogenesis process in these NF2
tumors. Clinically, they can be stable for long intervals
before entering periods of growth; identification and

characterization of the hypothetical “angiogenic switch”
responsible for their progression may help improve patient
monitoring and lead to new treatments.

Correction: Anti–Vascular Endothelial Growth
Factor Therapies as a Novel Therapeutic
Approach to Treating NeurofibromatosisRelated Tumors
After publication of this article (Cancer Res 2010;70:3483–93) in the May 1, 2010 issue
of Cancer Research (1), the authors discovered that the HEI193 cell line used in this
study did not contain the previously published G to A mutation at Nf2 exon 15. This
suggests an alternate mechanism for the loss of wild-type merlin in this cell line.
