Abstract
Cisplatin-derived anticancer therapy has been used for three
decades despite its side effects. Other types of organometallic
complexes, namely, some ruthenium-derived compounds
(RDC), which would display cytotoxicity through different
modes of action, might represent alternative therapeutic
agents. We have studied both in vitro and in vivo the
biological properties of RDC11, one of the most active
compounds of a new class of RDCs that contain a covalent
bond between the ruthenium atom and a carbon. We showed
that RDC11 inhibited the growth of various tumors
implanted in mice more efficiently than cisplatin. Importantly, in striking contrast with cisplatin, RDC11 did not
cause severe side effects on the liver, kidneys, or the
neuronal sensory system. We analyzed the mode of action
of RDC11 and showed that RDC11 interacted poorly with
DNA and induced only limited DNA damages compared with
cisplatin, suggesting alternative transduction pathways.
Indeed, we found that target genes of the endoplasmic
reticulum stress pathway, such as Bip, XBP1, PDI, and CHOP,
were activated in RDC11-treated cells. Induction of the
transcription factor CHOP, a crucial mediator of endoplasmic
reticulum stress apoptosis, was also confirmed in tumors
treated with RDC11. Activation of CHOP led to the expression
of several of its target genes, including proapoptotic genes.
In addition, the silencing of CHOP by RNA interference
significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of RDC11. Altogether,
our results led us to conclude that RDC11 acts by an atypical
pathway involving CHOP and endoplasmic reticulum stress,
and thus might provide an interesting alternative for
anticancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5458–66]

Introduction
Various metal complexes have been tested in anticancer therapy
(1–3). In particular, cisplatin has become one of the most widely
used drugs and is highly effective in treating several cancers such

as ovarian and testicular cancers (4). However, cisplatin displays,
along with other kinds of anticancer drugs, two major drawbacks:
(a) severe toxicities (neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, etc.) and (b)
limited applicability to a narrow range of tumors, as several of
them exhibit natural or induced resistance (4–6).
In the search of new therapies avoiding these drawbacks, other
metals have been considered as alternatives to platinum. Special
attention has been paid to ruthenium compounds because they
exhibit cytotoxicity against cancer cells, analogous ligandexchange abilities to platinum complexes, no cross-resistance
with cisplatin, and may display reduced toxicity against healthy
tissues by using iron transport (1–3, 7). One of the first ruthenium
compounds described to have anticancer activity was ruthenium
red (8), and further work showed the anticancer potential of
ruthenium-containing drugs (9, 10). Since then, several teams
have synthesized and characterized new compounds containing
ruthenium (II) or ruthenium (III) (11–16). Two of these
compounds, NAMI-A and KP109, have entered preclinical and/
or clinical trials (17, 18).
Based on the similarities with platinum compounds (19), studies
on the mode of action of ruthenium-containing compounds
focused on their interaction with DNA (20–22). Indeed, several
ruthenium-containing drugs interact with DNA and modify its
structure, suggesting that they might induce DNA damages.
Activation of p53 or p73 by some of these drugs partly
corroborated this hypothesis (23–25). Alternative modes of action
have also been described, including production of reactive oxygen
species (26), inhibition of kinases (27), modification of enzymatic
activities (28), or redox reactions (29). Obviously, the variety of
these effects might be linked to the structural diversity of the
ruthenium complexes.
Most of the ruthenium-containing compounds described have
ligands that are relatively weakly bound to the metal via a
heteroatom (N, O, S). In contrast, we have synthesized several
ruthenium-based complexes in which the ligand is bound to the
metal via strong covalent bonds such as a C-M ó bond (23, 30).
The stability of this bond ensures the attachment of the ligand to
the metal and enhances the biological activity of the complex.
Besides, the electronic behavior of the ruthenium and thus its
reactivity might be slightly different. We have called these molecules
ruthenium-derived compounds (RDC) and previously showed that
several RDCs are cytotoxic in vitro for several cancer cell lines that
are sensitive or resistant to cisplatin (23). In the present study, we
further characterized RDC11, one of the most active RDCs, by
showing its in vivo properties and by investigating its mode of
action independently of p53 proteins and DNA damages.

were started when tumors were palpable (10 d after injection) and were done twice a week. Graph shows tumor volumes; representative of three independent
experiments (n = 8). D, nude mice (Swiss nu/nu, Charles River; 8 wk old) were injected s.c. with 5  105 U87 cells. When tumors were palpable, injections of molar
equivalent doses of RDC11 or cisplatin were done twice a week during 24 d. Graph represents tumor volumes; representative of three independent experiments
(n = 8). *, P < 0.01, compared with control, as calculated by a one-way ANOVA test followed by a Newman-Keuls test over three independent experiments.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide test, and flow cytometry analysis. B16F10, U87, and TK6 cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. NH32 cells were
provided by Dr. H. Liber (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of
Washington, Seattle, WA). Cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal
bovine serum and incubated in the presence of 5% CO2/95% air at 37jC. 3(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) tests
were done with cells cultured in 96-well culture dishes (Costar) as previously
described (31). Hypodiploid DNA was measured as described (32) using
propidium iodide. The fluorescence of 10,000 cells was analyzed using a
FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
Western blot. Cells were treated in triplicates, lysed, and Western blots
were done as described (31). Equal loading was verified with an actin
antibody (1/200; Dr. Aunis, Physiopathologic du Systeme nerveux, INSERM
U575, Strasbourg, France). Immunoprobing was done with anti-Bip (1/250;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-XBP1 (1/250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti–phospho-H2AX antibody (1/3,000; Millipore), anti-CHOP (1/1,000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p53 (421, supernatant 1/3) antibodies.
Membranes were probed with a secondary horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated antibody (antirabbit, antigoat, or antimouse) diluted at 1/2,000.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was
extracted using RNAII Nucleospin (Macherey-Nagel). Reverse transcription
was done with 1 Ag RNA using Bio-Rad iScript kit. Quantitative PCR was
done in Bio-Rad iCycler thermal cycler using iQ SYBR Green supermix (BioRad Laboratories). Starting quantities of genes of interest were reported to
those of a housekeeping gene (18S). Specificity of the amplification was
controlled by a melting curve (31). Primer sequences are shown in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
siRNA silencing. CHOP siRNAs against human CHOP were
purchased form Dharmacon (DDIT smart pool siRNA). SiRNAs were
transfected in cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described
previously (33).
Blood biochemistry measures. C57BL/6 mice were treated chronically
by i.p. injection twice a week (13.3 Amol/kg, solution PBS/Cremophore) over
3 wk. Animals were subjected to anesthesia and blood samples were taken.
Biochemistry measurements were done at the Institut Clinique de la Souris
(Strasbourg, France).
Luciferase assay. Luciferase assays were done as described (31).
Luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer (Berthold systems).
Normalization of luciferase activity was done by replacing the reporter gene
of interest by a cytomegalovirus luciferase reporter vector. CHOP and TRB3
reporter plasmids were previously described (34–37).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cells were fixed with 1% (v/v)
formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and quenched with 0.125
mol/L glycine for 5 min. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
were carried out using the EZ-Magna ChIP Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore). Sheared cross-linked chromatin from f106 cells
was incubated overnight at 4jC with 3 Ag of mouse anti-CHOP (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) or normal mouse IgG (Millipore). Input corresponds to nonimmunoprecipitated sheared cross-linked chromatin from
f105 cells (1%). PCR analysis was done with 1/25th of immunoprecipitated DNA as template and primers of the mouse Trb3 proximal
promoter ( forward, GGGCGTGTGGCCCCGAAG; reverse,

Results
RDC11 inhibits the growth of various tumors implanted in
mice. To test the efficiency of RDC11 in vivo, we chose to implant
B16F10 mouse melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice and to use the
organometallic compound cisplatin as reference. We verified that
RDC11 reduced B16F10 cell number in vitro with an IC50 of
5 Amol/L, which was similar to the IC50 of cisplatin (Fig. 1A). As
previously shown for other RDCs (23), RDC11 favored the
apparition of a sub-G1 fraction in cell cycle profiles (Fig. 1B) and
induced nuclear condensation, as well as caspase-3 activation
(Supplementary Data 1A), showing that RDC11 induced cell death

in B16F10. Next, B16F10 cells were implanted s.c. in mice. When
tumors were palpable, mice were injected i.p. twice a week for 2
weeks with equivalent molar doses of RDC11 or cisplatin (Fig. 1C).
RDC11 reduced the volume (Fig. 1B) and weight of the tumors
by 40% compared with the control (Supplementary Data #1B). Of
note, the activity of RDC11 was better than that of cisplatin.
To further evaluate the activity of RDCs in vivo, we also used
human glioblastoma cells. MTT tests showed that RDC11 reduced
the number of glioblastoma cells with an IC50 between 1 and 5
Amol/L, except for U87 cells (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Data #1C).
Cell cycle profile analyses showed that RDC11 also induced the
sub-G1 phase in glioblastoma cells (Supplementary Data #1D). U87
cells were selected for in vivo studies in nude mice (Fig. 1D).
Twenty-four days after implantation, RDC11- and cisplatin-injected
mice had a tumor volume 45% smaller compared with control
mice. A similar reduction of tumor size after RDC11 treatment was
also observed on a model of xenografted A2780 ovarian cancer cells
in nude mice (Supplementary Data #2A).
These results indicated that RDC11 was able to significantly
decrease the growth of mouse and human tumors in vivo.
RDC11 leads to reduced chronic toxicity compared with
cisplatin. One of the major drawbacks of chemotherapies is the
lack of selectivity toward cancer cells, leading to side effects on
several tissues, such as the kidneys or the sensory nervous

system (5, 6). Therefore, we checked the deleterious effects
induced by RDC11 in mice. In a single dose experiment, the
LD50 was similar to cisplatin (f57 Amol/kg; Supplementary
Data #2B). To evaluate the chronic toxicity of RDC11, C57BL/6
mice were periodically injected with equivalent doses of RDC11
or cisplatin following the protocol described in Fig. 1C. After 3
weeks, cisplatin reduced body weights by about 25%, in contrast
to RDC11, which had no significant effect (Fig. 2A). Biomedical
analysis of blood markers showed that cisplatin induced variations
in uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,
a-amylase, glucose, bicarbonate, and iron, corresponding to
alterations in hepatic and renal functions (Fig. 2B). No significant
changes were observed for these blood markers in RDC11-treated
mice.
To analyze the toxicity on sensory nerves, we recorded their
conduction using electromyography on C57BL/6 mice periodically
injected as described above. Three weeks after the first injection,
cisplatin significantly reduced the speed of sensory nerve
conduction, whereas RDC11 affected it only modestly (Fig. 2C). A
gene expression analysis in sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia
revealed that the proapoptotic gene Noxa was up-regulated by
cisplatin, whereas the antiapoptotic gene Bi-1 was inhibited
(Fig. 2D; ref. 38). Interestingly, both genes were not significantly
affected by RDC11 treatments. This reduced toxicity of RDC11 on
healthy tissues can be correlated to the diminished cytotoxicity of

RDC11 interacts with DNA and induces DNA damage in vivo.
It is important to understand the mode of action of anticancer
drugs to improve their design and their use in combinatory or
tumor-selective treatments. Numerous studies indicated that
ruthenium-derived compounds interact with DNA (20–22), which
is consistent with our previous finding that RDCs induce p53 (23).
RDC11 can also induce p53 protein levels (Fig. 3A) and p53 target
genes (p21, GADD45, and PUMA; ref. 39; Supplementary Data #3A).
However, we had previously shown that p53 was not absolutely
necessary for RDC cytotoxicity (23), which is also the case for
RDC11 (Supplementary Data #3B). Therefore, there was an
unresolved question about whether RDCs interact with DNA and
induce DNA damages.
We first verified that RDC11 entered the cells (Fig. 3B). Then, we
followed the induction of DNA damages using as a marker the
phosphorylation of histone H2AX at serine 137 (40). Treatment
with cisplatin induced phosphorylation after 12 hours, whereas 24
hours were required for RDC11 (Fig. 3C). To evaluate whether
RDC11 interacted with DNA, Förster resonance energy transfer
(FRET) experiments were done using a double-stranded oligonucleotide labeled by two fluorophores at each end of one of the
oligonucleotides (Fig. 3D). The ability of cisplatin and RDC11 to
interact with the oligonucleotides was measured as a decrease of

the FRET efficiency, which is proportional to the separation of the
fluorophores. The efficiency of the transfer decreased very rapidly
at a critical drug concentration, corresponding at a molar ratio
with DNA of 0.1 to 1 in the case of cisplatin and 10 to 1 in the case
of RDC11. Calculations indicated that, at equilibrium, the length of
the DNA increases by 15%, from 4.6 to 5 nm, when cisplatin is
added, whereas it increases by 41%, up to 7.1 nm, when RDC11 is
added. Therefore, both RDC11 and cisplatin induced a different
structural change of the DNA double strand, and the affinity of
cisplatin for DNA is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of
RDC11. The direct interaction and the lower affinity of RDC11 for
DNA compared with cisplatin were confirmed by testing the ability
of these drugs to relax a circular, double-stranded DNA using
increasing ratios between the base pairs and the number of
molecules of drug (Fig. 3D, inset).
The reduced ability of RDC11 to interact with DNA and the
p53-independent activity of RDC suggested that alternative

pathways might be involved in addition to the induction of
DNA damages.
RDC11 induces the activity of components of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. As an alternative mode of action
for RDC11, we investigated the endoplasmic reticulum stress
pathway, given that cisplatin was reported to regulate it (41). We
examined the expression of typical endoplasmic reticulum stress–
inducible genes (Bip, XBP1, and PDI; refs. 42, 43). As positive
control, we treated the cells with tunicamycin. Interestingly, we
found that RDC11 clearly stimulated these endoplasmic reticulum
genes, which was not the case for cisplatin. We also confirmed the
induction of Bip and XBP1 by Western blot (Fig. 4B).
To further characterize the role of the endoplasmic reticulum
stress pathway in RDC11 activity, we followed the expression of the
transcription factor CHOP, which has been described as a critical
mediator of endoplasmic reticulum stress apoptosis (44–46). We
found that RDC11 significantly induced CHOP mRNA levels and

Anticancer Action of RDC via CHOP

blot. D, Western blot analysis of CHOP

promoter activity (Fig. 4C and D; ref. 37). This induction was
confirmed at the protein level in vivo (B16F10-derived tumors
in C57BL/6 mice; Fig. 5C; Supplementary Data #4) and in vitro
(B16F10 and U87 cells; Fig. 5A–D; Supplementary Data #3C).
In vitro, the intensity of CHOP induction by RDC11 was similar to
the one observed with tunicamycin, indicating that this induction
was physiologically relevant. In all cases, cisplatin only marginally
induced CHOP expression. RDC11 induced CHOP expression in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Data #3C). Note
that the weak induction of CHOP expression at 1 Amol/L correlates
with a limited action of RDC11 on cell viability, whereas a more
robust induction of CHOP correlated with a more stringent effect
of RDC11 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, comparison of CHOP induction
and phosphorylation of histone H2AX by different doses of RDC11
and cisplatin showed striking opposite effects: Cisplatin was more
potent on H2AX phosphorylation, whereas RDC11 more significantly induced CHOP (Fig. 5A and B).
To assess whether the induction of CHOP was dependent of p53,
we used the NH32 p53-knockdown cell line and its parental
counterpart (TK6; Fig. 5D): The absence of p53 did not significantly
affect the ability of RDC11 to induce CHOP, suggesting that the two
mechanisms were independently activated.
We also verified the functionality of the induced CHOP. We first
followed the expression of two proapoptotic CHOP target genes,
TRB3 (34, 35) and CHAC1 (47). RDC11 induced the mRNA levels
of both genes (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, using reporter gene assays,
we found that RDC11 activated the TRB3 promoter dependently
on the CHOP responsive element (Fig. 6B). Finally, using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we showed that RDC11
stimulated the binding of CHOP to the TRB3 promoter (Fig. 6C;
ref. 35).

www.aacrjournals.org

To assess the importance of CHOP induction in RDC11 activity,
we used validated siRNA directed against CHOP and analyzed if it
would affect RDC11 activity in U87 cells. The siRNA directed against
CHOP significantly reduced the expression of CHOP, whereas
control and mutated siRNAs had no effect (Fig. 6C, inset). The
silencing of CHOP expression significantly improved the viability
of cells treated with various concentrations of RDC11, strongly
suggesting that CHOP is necessary for RDC11 cytotoxicity (Fig. 6D).
To further confirm the proapoptotic role of CHOP, we showed that
overexpression of CHOP induced cell death and favored the biological activity of RDC11 (Supplementary Data #3D).

Discussion
Platinum-based therapies have been used for decades in
anticancer protocols despite their limitations, such as resistance
of certain types of cancers or secondary effects. To fill these gaps,
we have recently characterized the biological activities of a new
class of organometallic drugs containing a ruthenium atom. The
stability of these compounds is increased, and we have previously
shown that they exhibited a strong cytotoxicity in vitro (23, 30). In
this new study, we further characterized the properties of RDC11,
one of our most efficient RDCs.
RDC11 reduces tumor growth in vivo with less toxicity. In
this study, we have established, using three different in vivo models
(B16F10, melanomas; U87, glioblastomas; A2780, ovarian cancer),
that RDC11 has interesting anticancer activity (Fig. 1C and D;
Supplementary Data #2A). Indeed, the comparison of RDC11 with
cisplatin indicated that RDC11 has a slightly better activity on
tumor growth but, more importantly, does not induce as much
deleterious side effects such as weight loss, neurotoxicity,

nephrotoxicity, or liver toxicity (Fig. 2A–D). Nevertheless, as
expected for cytotoxic compounds, overdose of RDC11 caused
lethality at doses similar to cisplatin (Supplementary Data #2B).
Similarly to other RDCs (23), the anticancer activity of RDC11
can be explained by its ability to trigger cell death because it
induced a sub-G1 phase, the condensation of nuclei, and the
activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Data #1A and D),
as we previously showed for other RDCs (23). However, cell cycle
arrest can also be a part of the RDC11-driven effect, depending on
the cell line and the concentration applied (23).
The lower toxicity of RDC11 chronic treatment was also
supported by the reduced cytotoxicity of RDC11 on primary
culture of glial cells compared with transformed cells (Supplementary Data #2C), which correlated with a reduced induction of CHOP
protein levels in nonmalignant glial cells (Supplementary Data
#3C). As proposed for other ruthenium-derived compounds, the
lower toxicity of RDC11 might be attributed to its ability to mimic
iron and the use of iron detoxification routes in the body or the
differential cellular intake of iron between normal and cancer cells
(1–3, 7).
RDC11 induces DNA damages. To understand more thoroughly the anticancer properties of RDC11, we have investigated
its mode of action. We have shown in this study that RDC11 can
enter the cell, interact with DNA, and provoke DNA damages
(Fig. 3B–D). These properties explain the activation of p53 and its
target genes (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Data #3A; ref. 23). However,
our study also showed that RDC11 induces less DNA damages
than cisplatin, which correlates with its lower affinity to DNA
(Fig. 3C and D). These observations suggest that the contribution
of DNA damage–activated pathways might not be critical for

RDC11 cytotoxicity, which is supported by the fact that the
absence of p53 does not significantly impede RDC activity
(Supplementary Data #3B; ref. 23).
However, even if this mode of action through DNA interaction
seems less important compared with cisplatin, it has to be taken
into account and is likely involved in RDC11 cytotoxicity. Indeed,
the relative insensibility toward p53 deletion does not necessary
mean that RDC11-induced DNA damages are not a significant part
of the RDC11 proapoptotic mechanisms. For instance, RDC11
might induce DNA damage–dependent mechanisms through p53
homologues (p73; ref. 48) or other factors such as promyelocytic
leukemia protein (49). The fact that overexpression of the
dominant-negative isoform DNp73h reduced RDC11-induced cell
death supports the possibility that p53 family members are
involved in RDC11-induced cell death (Supplementary Data #3D;
ref. 23). The induction by RDC11 of proapoptotic p53 target genes,
such as GADD45 and Noxa, can account for RDC11-induced cell
death (39). Furthermore, we also observed an induction of genes
involved in DNA damage repairs, such as MDC1, HUS1, and RAD9
(data not shown; ref. 50).
RDC11 has multiple cellular targets, implicating the
endoplasmic reticulum stress effector CHOP. The lack of strict
correlation between the dramatic deleterious effect of RDC11 and
its weak induction of DNA damages when compared with cisplatin
(Figs. 1 and 3) suggested that RDC11 might have other cellular
targets. We have now shown that RDC11 induced the expression of
several genes of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway (Bip,
XBP1, PDI, and CHOP; refs. 42, 43, 45, 46; Fig. 4), which represents
the first report of a regulation of this pathway by a rutheniumcontaining compound. Among these genes, we identified CHOP as

Fig. 6. CHOP activity is induced by RDC11 and is
important for RDC11 effect. A, RDC11 induced the
mRNA levels of Trb3 and CHAC1 . Cells were treated
with cisplatin or RDC11 (5 Amol/L). RT-qPCR was
done using primers for Trb3, CHAC1, and 18S . Data
are represented as fold inductions relative to untreated
cells (Ct ) and were normalized with 18S levels.
B, RDC11 induced TRB3 promoter through the CHOP
responsive element. Cells were cotransfected with a
luciferase reporter gene containing either the Trb3
promoter ( 262/+173) or a variant mutated in the
CHOP binding site (CHOPmut-Luc). Cells were then
treated with RDC11 (2.5 and 5 Amol/L) for 24 h before
the luciferase assay. C, chromatin immunoprecipitation

Anticancer Action of RDC via CHOP

functionally important for RDC11 cytotoxicity. First, we showed
that RDC11 induced CHOP expression at the promoter level,
leading to increased CHOP mRNA and protein levels in vitro and
in vivo (Figs. 4C and D and 5A–D; Supplementary Data #4). Second,
we showed that the elevated CHOP protein levels led to an increase
in CHOP-dependent transcriptional activity, as (a) RDC11 treatment stimulated the expression of two CHOP proapoptotic target
genes, TRB3 and CHAC1 (Fig. 6A), and (b) RDC11 induced the
TRB3 promoter activity through the binding of CHOP to this
promoter (Fig. 6B and C). Finally, the silencing of CHOP
significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of RDC11 (Fig. 6C), whereas
on the contrary, CHOP overexpression facilitated RDC11-induced
cell death (Supplementary Data #3D). This proapoptotic role of
CHOP is in accord with the literature (43, 45, 46).
Altogether, our data suggest that RDCs activity involves at least
two pathways: the DNA damage/p53 and the endoplasmic
reticulum stress/CHOP pathways. It is rather difficult to precisely
understand to what extent they are independently activated by
RDC11 and if they act synergistically. However, three observations
suggest that RDC11 might induce them independently. First, there
was a clear discrimination between the induction of DNA damages
and CHOP depending on the drugs used. RDC11 is less efficient in
inducing DNA damage signaling (H2AX phosphorylation) but can
strongly up-regulate CHOP expression (Figs. 3–5), whereas
cisplatin, which induces much more important DNA damages,
does not significantly regulate CHOP expression. The second
argument is that the knockdown of p53 does not inhibit the
expression of CHOP. Finally, a variant of RDC11 (RDC34), which
displays a stronger affinity for DNA in vitro, does not exhibit a
significant increase in its ability to induce CHOP expression (data

not shown). Because both pathways are activated by RDC11, it is
likely that they both participate and might cooperate to allow a full
cellular response to RDC11 treatment. The fact that both the
silencing of CHOP and the inactivation of p53-like activity by
DNp73h overexpression can reduce RDC11 activity supports this
hypothesis. However, we do not exclude that other pathways might
be also involved.
The ability of RDC11 to induce multiple and independent stress
response pathways represents an interesting property for anticancer drugs that might allow a broader spectrum of action. It might
also partly explain why RDCs are less sensitive toward cisplatin
resistance mechanisms (23). In this aspect, the utilization and/or
the targeting of this endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in the
future might enhance the spectrum of action and the efficiency of
anticancer chemotherapy, as well as create new possibilities for
effective combinatory treatments.
