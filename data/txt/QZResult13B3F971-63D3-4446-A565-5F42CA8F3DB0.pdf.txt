ABSTRACT
Chronic metabolic inflammation in adipose tissue plays an important role in the
development of obesity-associated diseases. Our previous study indicated that total
saponins of Panax japonicus (SPJ) rhizoma and Chikusetsu saponin V, one main
component of SPJ, could exert the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The
present study aimed to investigate the in vivo and Ex vivo anti-inflammatory activities
of another main component of SPJ, namely Chikusetsu saponin IVa (CS). CS could
significantly inhibited HFD-induced lipid homeostasis, and inhibited inflammation in
adipose tissue, as reflected by the decreased mRNA expression levels of inflammationrelated genes and secretion of the chemokines/cytokines, inhibited the accumulation
of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and shifted their polarization from M1 to M2,
suppressed HFD-induced expression of NLRP3 inflammasome component genes and
decreased IL-1β and Caspase-1 production in mice. Moreover, CS treatment also inhibited
the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs).
Meanwhile, CS treatment inhibited an NLRP3-induced ASC pyroptosome formation and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pyroptosis. Furthermore, CS treatment suppressed
HFD-induced NF-κB signaling in vivo and LPS-induced NF-κB activation as reflected by
the fact that their phosphorylated forms and the ratios of pNF-κB/NF-κB, pIKK/IKK, and
pIκB/IκB were all decreased in EAT from HFD-fed mice treated with CS as compared
with those of HFD mice. Taking together, this study has revealed that CS effectively
inhibits HFD-induced inflammation in adipose tissue of mice through inhibiting both
NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NF-κB signaling. Thus, CS can serve as a potential
therapeutic drug in the prevention and treatment of inflammation-associated diseases.

INTRODUCTION

Adipocytes can secret inflammation-associated adipokines
besides acting as the storage pool of excessive fat [4].
During the development of inflammation-associated
diseases, several the pathological events take place,
which include (a) the infiltration of bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) in adipose tissue, (b) accumulation
of “crown like structures(CLS)”, (c) increased expression
of pro-inflammatory genes and (d) secretion of
inflammation-associated cytokines/chemokines, such as

Obesity is the worldwide health problem, which
can increase the risk of many other chronic diseases,
such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipemia, and cardiovascular disease [1]. Obesity
is also closely related with the metabolic inflammation,
especially in adipose tissue [2, 3], an important organ
that regulates the energy homeostasis of the whole-body.

TNF-α, IL-1β, SAA3, MCP-1, IL-6, CCL-5, CXCL-1, and
caspase-1 [5]. Chronic metabolic inflammation in adipose
tissue plays an important role in the development of
obesity-related diseases. Therefore, to ameliorate metabolic
inflammation in adipose tissue can be an important way for
the prevention and cure of obesity-related diseases.
The important pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
as interleukine-1β (IL-1β), are involved in several kinds
of inflammatory diseases [6]. Generally, for IL-1β, its
production needs two steps: the first step is an NF-κBdependent priming step, in which the transcription of
pro-IL-1β and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-richcontaining family, pyrin domain-containing-3 and/or Nodlike receptor protein 3 (NLPR3) are induced; the second
step is an activation step that induces the activation of
caspase-1, which can proteolytically process pro-IL-1β
into biologically active IL-1β[6].
NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of several
proteins, including NLRP3, caspase-1, and transient
receptor potential vanilloid 4(TRPV4), which is
important for the production of caspase-1 and IL-1β
[7, 8]. NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by
nigericin, ATP, and monosodium urate (MSU) [7].
However, excessive activation can lead to the development
of several inflammatory diseases [9]. On the other hand,
the genetic ablation of NLRP3 or caspase-1 and the other
components of NLRP3 inflammasome has been found
to decrease IL-1β level in adipose tissue and protect
against the inflammation induced by obesity [10–12].
All of these studies have indicated that the abnormal
activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is tightly correlated
with inflammatory diseases, although normal NLRP3
inflammasome activation can contribute to the defense of
the body [9]. Therefore, to find out the agents that can
selectively inhibit activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
will be highly significant for prevention and treatment of
inflammation-related diseases.
A number of studies have reported that some
medicinal plants and their extracts, such as genistein
[13], kaempferol and daidzein [14], quercetin [15] and
green tea [16], possess the anti-inflammatory effects.
Panax japonicas (PJ) is a plant belonging to family
Araliaceae Panax, and grows in Japan and southwest
of China. PJ rhizoma has been known as “the king of
herbal medicine” in traditional Tujia and Hmong people
in China, and used as the substitute for Ginseng roots in
minority ethnic group. Recent studies have revealed that
saponins, polysaccharides, volatile oil and amine acids
are the main components of PJ rhizoma, and proven
that they have extensive pharmacological effects [17].
Saponins of Panax japonicus rhizoma (SPJR), the most
abundant components of PJ rhizoma, mainly contain
Chikusetsu saponin V, Chikusetsu saponin IV, Chikusetsu
saponin IVa (CS), Panax saponin Re, and Pjs-2 etc.
[17]. In our previous studies, we had demonstrated that
SPJ exerted the potent inhibitory effects on oxidation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and inflammation [17, 18]. Our recent study also has
revealed that Chikusetsu saponin V, one main component
of SPJ, exerts the anti-inflammatory effects on acute
liver injury in mice [19]. However, whether Chikusetsu
saponin IVa (CS), another main component of SPJ, can
have anti-inflammatory activities or can inhibit NLRP3
inflammasome remains to be determined.
Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate
whether CS possesses anti-inflammatory activities or
inhibitory activities on NLRP3 inflammasome. Our
results demonstrated that CS could potentially improve
HFD-induced lipid homeostasis and inhibit inflammation
in adipose tissue of mice. Ex vivo and in vivo analyses
revealed that CS could inhibit HFD-induced caspase-1 and
IL-1β production from epididymal adipose tissue (EAT);
CS could also inhibit the accumulation of adipose tissue
macrophages (ATMs) and alter their polarization from
M1 to M2. CS was capable of inhibiting both NLRP3
inflammasome activation and NF-κB signaling. This study
has revealed that CS can be potentially used to prevent or
cure inflammation-related diseases.

RESULTS
CS treatment improved HFD-induced lipid
homeostasis in mice
To determine the influence of CS on HFD-induced
inflammation in adipose tissue, 5-week old male mice
were fed with ND, HFD, HFD+CS-L or HFD+CS-H
for 16 weeks, respectively. No significant difference
in food intake was seen among mice in all four groups
(Supplementary Figure 1). The levels of cholesterol and
triglyceride in serum and liver were increased significantly
in HFD group as compared to those in ND group, whereas
treatment with CS-L (50 mg/kg) and CS-H (100 mg/kg)
significantly reduced HFD-induced increases in levels
of both cholesterol and triglyceride (Figure 1C and 1D).
These data indicate that CS can improve HFD-induced
lipid homeostasis in serum and liver of mice.

CS treatment ameliorated HFD-induced
inflammation in adipose tissue
Based on the aforementioned purpose, we
determined the mRNA expression levels of several
inflammation-related genes, including TNF-a, IL-6,
MCP-1, CCL-5, CXCL-1 and SAA3, in epididymal
adipose tissue (EAT). As shown in Figure 2A, compared
with those of ND group, HFD could result in significant
increases in mRNA expression levels of TNF-a, CCL-5,
IL-6, CXCL-1, MCP-1 and SAA3 in EATs (p < 0.01);
Treatment with Chikusetsu saponin IVa (CS-L and CS-H)
caused significant inhibitions on the increased expression
levels of these genes in EATs induced by HFD (p < 0.05)
in a dose-dependent manner. However, while the fat

weight of EAT was significantly higher in HFD than in ND
group, the CS-L and CS-H treatments caused only slight
but not significant reduction of the increased fat weights of
EAT induced by HFD (Supplementary Figure 2).
To further determine whether these effects on
mRNA expression levels of these genes could result in the
corresponding alterations in the secretion of chemokines
and cytokines, we isolated the EAT from mice fed with
ND, HFD, HFD+CS-L or HFD+CS-H for 16 weeks,
minced the EAT (0.8 g/mouse) and cultured them in
DMEM medium without serum for 24 h. After culture for
24 h, their supernatants were harvested and the protein
levels of TNF-a, MCP-1, IL-1β and Caspase-1 were
measured with ELISA kits. Similar to what were observed
at the mRNA expression levels, the concentrations of
these proteins in the culture medium were significantly

induced by HFD, which were all significantly decreased
by CS-L and CS-H treatments in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2B). Collectively, these data indicate that CS
potently inhibits HFD-induced inflammation in adipose
tissue.

CS treatment inhibited the accumulation of
adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and altered
their polarization
ATMs have been known to play important roles in
the formation of inflammation [3]. Based on the above
described observations, we attempted to determine
whether CS affects the infiltration of macrophages into
adipose tissue. We examined the effects of CS on the
mRNA expression levels of three macrophage markers,

including CD11b, CD68, and F4/80. As shown in
Figure 3A, the mRNA expression levels of CD11b, CD68,
and F4/80 were increased significantly in EATs of HFDfed mice, as compared with those of ND group, indicating
that macrophages are actively recruited into adipose tissue
by HFD. Consistent with its reduction of HFD-induced
increases in mRNA expression levels of cytokines and
chemokines, CS treatment significantly reduced the
expression of these macrophage markers after 16 weeks
of HFD (Figure 3A). We also observed a significant
increase in the number of stromal vascular fraction (SVF)
cells induced by HFD and the significant reductions in
the number of SVF cells in EAT of mice treated with
CS in a dose-dependent manner, as compared with those
in HFD mice (Figure 3B). Furthermore, histological
analysis also revealed much higher number of “crownlike structures” around adipocytes in HFD-fed mice than
in ND mice, whereas numbers of “crown-like structures”
were significantly reduced in CS-L and CS-H treated-HFD
mice in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C), which
were shown to represent the macrophages in fat tissues
[20]. To further investigate the subset contents of these
macrophages, we measured the mRNA expression levels
of macrophage subtype-specific markers in EAT. The

mRNA expression levels of two M1 macrophage markers,
i.e. CD11c and iNOS, were increased significantly in HFD
mice, as compared to those in ND mice. However, CS-L
and CS-H treatments significantly decreased the mRNA
expression levels of CD11c and iNOS in HFD mice
(Figure 3D). In addition, the mRNA expression levels
of two M2 macrophage markers, i.e. CD206 and Mgl2,
were significantly reduced in HFD-fed mice as compared
to those in ND mice while their mRNA expression levels
were significantly increased in CS-L and CS-H treated
HFD mice, as compared to those of HFD mice in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3E). Collectively, these
results indicate that CS treatment decreases the number
of M1 macrophages but increases the number of M2
macrophages, therefore, decreasing the ratio of M1/M2
in EAT.

CS treatment inhibited HFD-induced expression
of NLRP3 inflammasome component genes and
reduced NF-κB signaling in EAT
As shown in Figure 2B, CS treatment reduced
HFD-induced secretion of both IL-1β and Caspase-1 in
EAT culture supernatant. This observation prompted us to

the relative mRNA expression levels of TNF-a, MCP-1, IL-6, CCL-5, CXCL-1 and SAA3 in EAT from mice fed with ND, HFD, HFD plus

determine whether CS treatment affects the expression of
NLRP3 inflammasome component genes, including IL-1,
Caspase-1, Nlrp3, and Asc (Pycard) in EAT. Consistent
with those reported previously [21], the mRNA expression
levels of IL-1β, Caspase-1, Nlrp3, and Asc were all
elevated in HFD-fed mice, as compared to those of ND
mice (Figure 4A). CS-L and CS-H treatments significantly
decreased the increased mRNA expression levels of these
genes induced by HFD in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4A). We also measured their protein expression
levels in mice of these groups. Similar to the results of
the mRNA expression levels of these genes, the protein
expression levels of IL-1β, Caspase-1, Nlrp3, and Asc
were also significantly increased in mice of HFD-fed

groups, which were significantly reduced in mice of
both CS-L and CS-H groups (Figure 4B). These data
suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of CS are likely
mediated by inhibiting HFD-induced activation of NLRP3
inflammasome.
In our previous study, we demonstrated that
total saponin extracts from Panax japonicus (SPJ) and
Chikusetsu saponin V, one main component of SPJ,
could inhibit NF-κB signaling [18, 19]. Therefore, we
determined whether CS could also have the inhibitory
effects on NF-κB signaling by examining the levels
of several important components of NF-κB signaling,
including NF-κB, IKK, and IκB and their corresponding
phosphorylated forms via Western blot analysis. As shown

Figure 3: CS treatment inhibits the accumulation of ATMs and alters their polarization. (A) Relative mRNA expression

levels of macrophage markers in EAT from mice fed with ND, HFD, HFD plus CS-L or HFD plus CS-H for 16 weeks were determined

in Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure 3, while the total
protein expression levels of NF-κB, IKK, and IκB were
unchanged, their phosphorylated forms and the ratios
of pNF-κB/NF-κB, pIKK/IKK, and pIκB/IκB were all
decreased in EAT from HFD-fed mice treated with CS as
compared with those of HFD mice. These results suggest
that CS is also likely involved in inhibiting the HFDinduced activation of NF-κB signaling.

LPS nor ATP alone caused much increased amounts of
IL-1β, whereas their combination significantly induced
IL-1β production. CS treatment could significantly inhibit
IL-1β production induced by LPS plus ATP in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5A). Meanwhile, CS treatment
did not significantly affect the viability of BMDMs at
the indicated concentrations (Supplementary Figure 4).
Latz, E., et al. have reported that pro-IL-1β induction
and caspase-1 activation are the important steps for IL-1β
production induced by NLRP3[6]. To explore whether
CS-mediated inhibition of LPS+ATP-induced IL-1β
production is involved in these steps, we measured IL-1β
protein level with western blot analyses. Consistent with
the ELISA results (Figure 5A), LPS plus ATP induced IL1β production and caspase-1 activation in BMDMs and
increased extracellular secretion of IL-1β and caspase-1
(Figure 5B). As mentioned above, IL-1β production
requires both priming and activating steps. We examined
the effects of CS treatment on both steps. CS treatment

CS potently inhibited ATP-induced activation of
NLRP3 inflammasome in BMDMs
To further confirm whether CS-mediated
inhibition of inflammation is via inhibition of NLRP3
inflammasome, BMDMs were treated with CS at the
indicated concentrations for 24 h, stimulated with 1 μg/mL
LPS for 4 h, and then exposed to 2 mM ATP for 1 h.
The contents of IL-1β in culture supernatants were
determined by ELISA. As shown in Figure 5A, neither

pictures are shown as the representative of at least three independent experiments.

CS inhibited an NLRP3-induced formation
of ASC pyroptosome and suppressesed the
pyroptosis induced by LPS

significantly inhibited IL-1β production and caspase-1
activation induced by LPS plus ATP in BMDMs when
CS was added at both priming and activating steps in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 5C). Pro-IL-1β expression
was also decreased when BMDMs were treated with CS
(Figure 5C). To further determine the effect of CS
on inhibiting ATP-induced activation of NLRP3
inflammasome, we treated BMDMs with CS at either the
priming or the activating step, respectively. As shown in
Figure 5D, CS could inhibit pro-IL-1β expression induced
by LPS when it was added at only the priming step but
not at the activation step. Activation of caspase-1 was also
inhibited by CS treatment, whereas IL-1β production was
almost not inhibited (Figure 5D). However, caspase-1
expression and IL-1β production were remarkably reduced
when CS was added at only the activating step (Figure 5E).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that CS can inhibit
ATP-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
Parthenolide derived from a plant has been reported
to be a natural inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome
[22]. Thus, we compared the inhibitory effects of CS
on inflammasome activation with those of parthenolide.
Treatment of BMDMs with parthenolide remarkably
decreased the expression levels of IL-1β and caspase-1
induced by ATP (Figure 5F). The inhibitory effects of CS
were quite similar to those of parthenolide (Figure 5F).

The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the
formation of ASC pyroptosome, which is a supramolecular
assembly of ASC dimers involved in mediating
inflammatory cell death via caspase-1 activation and is
composed of ASC dimers [24]. As shown in Figure 6A,
LPS plus ATP stimulation caused the formation of ASC
dimers. However, parthenolide inhibited the formation of
ASC pyroptosome induced by LPS plus ATP (Figure 6A).
Similar to parthenolide, treatment of BMDMs with CS
at 20 or 40 μM remarkably inhibited ASC pyroptosome
formation induced by LPS plus ATP (Figure 6A). These
data indicate that inhibition of activation of NLRP3
inflammasome may contribute to the inhibition of ASC
pyroptosome.
Pyroptosis, a inflammatory form of programmed
cell death, is dependent on caspase-1 and can be caused
by inflammasome activation [25]. Pyroptotic cells destroy
their structures and release lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
and also make macrophages easy to release IL-1β. To
further confirm the effects of CS on the activation of
NLRP3 inflammasome, we measured the LDH levels
in BMDMs. As shown in Figure 6B, either LPS or ATP
alone did not cause much release of LDH, LPS plus ATP
stimulation caused an increasing release of LDH at 1, 2,
4 and 8 h in a time-dependent manner. CS significantly
inhibited LDH release from BMDMs at 1, 2 and 4 h,
but the inhibitory effects were not significant at 8 h
after stimulation with LPS plus ATP. These suggest that
CS can inhibit the pyroptosis. CS significantly inhibited
LPS+ATP-induced expression of IL-1b from BMDMs
at 1, 2, 4 and 8h (Figure 6C). However, the reduction
of IL-1β release at 8 h after stimulation with LPS plus
ATP was not mainly due to the suppression of pyroptosis
(Figure 6C). Collectively, all of these data indicate that
CS can inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via
inhibiting the pyroptosis.

CS potently inhibited monosodium urate (MSU)induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in
BMDMs
MSU also engaged the NLRP3 inflammasome
activation [23]. Thus, we attempted to determine whether
CS can inhibit MSU-induced activation of NLRP3
inflammasome. As shown in Supplementary Figure 5A
and 5B, LPS-induced slight increase in IL-1β but not
caspase-1. MSU alone did not induce expression levels
of IL-1β and caspase-1. LPS plus MSU substantially
induced the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β. CS potently
inhibited caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production in
BMDMs induced by MSU plus LPS.
On the other hand, in order to test the inhibitory
effects of CS on IL-1β production in human cells, THP-1
cells, a human monocytic cell line, were firstly treated
with 500 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 3 h, and
continuously cultured overnight without PMA to allow them to
differentiate into macrophagic cells. As expected, CS inhibited
LPS plus ATP- or LPS plus MSU-induced IL-1β production in
these differentiated macrophages in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure 5C), suggesting that the inhibitory
effects of CS on activation of NLRP3 inflammasome are not
limited to mouse macrophages but also to human-derived
cells such as THP-1 cells. Taken together, these results clearly
demonstrate that CS is capable of inhibiting the activation of
NLRP3 inflammasome induced by different stimuli.

CS treatment inhibited the activation of NF-κB
pathway in BMDMs induced by LPS
As mentioned above, we have found that CS can
inhibit NF-κB activation in EAT of mice (Figure 4C and
Supplementary Figure 3). To further confirm the inhibitory
effect of CS on the NF-κB signaling, we treated BMDMs
with CS at the indicated concentrations. As shown in
Figure 7A, treatment of BMDMs with CS did not change
the total protein levels of NF-κB p65 and IκB, but resulted
in the significant decreases in levels of the phosphorylated
forms of NF-κB p65 and IκB induced by LPS. Moreover,
CS treatment significantly inhibited the nuclear DNAbinding ability of NF-κB (Figure 7B), strongly indicating

respectively. (C–E) BMDMs were stimulated with 0.2 μg/ml LPS for 4 h, and followed by incubating with 2 mM ATP for 1 h. After being

the possibility that CS can inhibit the nuclear translocation
of NF-κB. As expected, pretreatment of BMDMs with CS
dose-dependently decreased the nuclear translocation of
NF-κB p65 induced by LPS (Figure 7C). Furthermore, the
LPS-induced mRNA expression levels of prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase 2 (ptgs2) (Figure 7D) and nitrite
oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) (Figure 7F) were significantly
inhibited by CS in BMDMs in a dose-dependent manner.
Ptgs2 and NOS2 were the target genes of NF-κB [30]. CS
significantly inhibited the TNF-α secretion stimulated by
LPS in BMDMs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7F).
Taken together, these data indicate that CS inhibits LPSinduced activation of NF-κB pathway and the expression
of its target genes in BMDMs.

the hypertrophic adipocytes, which play important roles in
causing energy imbalance and dysregulation of metabolic
pathways, and then adipocytes recruit macrophages into
adipose tissues and secrete inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, thus, leading to formation of metabolic
inflammation. There is a need of finding out medicines
that can effectively ameliorate HFD-induced obesity.
In the present study, we demonstrated that CS
could effectively ameliorate HFD-induced inflammation
in adipose tissue, inhibit ATM accumulation and shift
the polarization from M1 to M2. We also demonstrated
an important role of CS in reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, by suppressing the
activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-kB pathway
induced by LPS, indicating that NLRP3 inflammasome
and NF-kB pathway may be the important targets for CS
anti-inflammatory activity.
Many pathological events, such as viral and
bacterial infection and metabolic imbalance, can activate
inflammasome. Among various inflammasomes, NLRP3
inflammasome has been associated with a number of

NLRP3 inflammasome activation can finally result in
chronic inflammation-associated diseases, such as insulin
resistance, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer etc.
NLRP3 inflammasome may be a potentially important
target for anti-inflammatory therapies [27]. Therefore,
finding and identification of natural molecules capable
of inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome is of significance to
develop effective therapeutics for inflammation-associated
diseases.
Saponins from Panax japonicus (SPJ), the most
abundant and active components in rhizoma of Panax
japonicus, mainly include Panax saponins Re, Chikusetsu
saponin V, Pjs-2, Chikusetsu saponin IV and Chikusetsu
saponin IVa (CS) etc. [17]. We have demonstrated that
SPJ and Chikusetsu saponin V, one component of SPJ,
had anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities
[17–19, 28]. Herein, we demonstrated that CS, another
major component of SPJ, also significantly improved HFDinduced lipid homeostasis and attenuated HFD-induced
inflammation in adipose tissue of mice (Figure 1C–1D
and Figure 2) as reflected by its inhibition of HFD-induced
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6)
and chemokines, including MCP-1, CCL-5, CXCL-1 and
SAA3. It is worth noting that the same CS treatments did
not significantly reduce the food intake and fat weight of
EAT in mice (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). The body
weights of mice of HFD + CS-L and HFD + CS-H groups
were slightly but not significantly decreased as compared
with those in mice of HFD (data not shown), suggesting
that treatments of mice with CS at the doses used and the
intervention duration do not causes severe toxicity on
the growth and development of EAT and body weight of
mice. However, Li et al. [29] reported that CS treatment
significantly decreased the body weight of rats. This is not
consistent with our data, suggesting that the effects of CS
on HFD-induced body weight in mice should be debated.
This disparity may be related to differences in sources of
CS, experimental animal strains (mice versus rats), drug
doses and especially the intervention durations. Thus, the
effects of CS on body weight in different animal strains,
appropriate drug doses, the intervention duration and the
toxicity in vivo need to be further investigated in more detail
in our subsequent work for ensuring whether CS treatments
at broader dose range and the entire duration during and
after treatment can cause any significant toxicity.
Although white adipose tissues include visceral
and subcutaneous adipose tissues, the former has greater
capacity of macrophage recruitment and secrete more proinflammatory mediators than does the latter in responding
to HFD [3]. Altintas et al. reported that macrophage
infiltration into EAT was the most severe event in
visceral adipose tissues [30]. Thus, we mainly focused on
macrophages in EAT. The infiltration of ATM has been
regarded as the important events during inflammation in
adipose tissue [3]. We have proven that CS can ameliorate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the HFD-induced inflammation in adipose tissue
(Figure 2). Based this, we hypothesized that CS could
suppress macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. Our
next experiments confirmed this hypothesis. As shown
in Figure 3A–3C, CS attenuated macrophage infiltration
into adipose tissues, decreased the number of M1
macrophages, increased the number of M2 macrophages,
and shifted the ratio of M1/M2 in EATs as indicated by the
decreased levels of M1-macrophage-specific markers and
the increased levels of M2-macrophage-specific markers
(Figure 3D–3E). CS can ameliorate obesity-associated
inflammation in adipose tissue through potently inhibiting
macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. Macrophages
are the important inflammatory cells and include
2 subtypes, namely M1 and M2 subtype. M1 subtype is
mainly responsible for pro-inflammatory response while
M2 subtype is mainly responsible for anti-inflammatory
response. CS-induced reduction of M1 macrophages and
the increase of M2 macrophages, and the reducted M1/M2
ratio further demonstrated that anti-inflammatory activity
of CS is achieved, at least in part, through decreasing
recruitment of M1 subpopulation and increasing
recruitment of M2 subpopulation of macrophages.
M1 macrophages are the major sources of
inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-1b. They
release cytokines via a series of orchestrated pathways,
which are coordinated by multi-protein complexes.
When being exposed to inflammatory stimuli, they
secrete cytokines/chemokines e.g. TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-12, as well as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and
complement. Together, these molecules enhance vascular
permeability and recruitment of inflammatory cells and
produce systemic effects such as the production of acute
inflammatory response proteins and fever [31]. TNF-a
stimulates the acute phase of the immune response and also
exerts its effects in other organs [32]. For instance, it can
stimulate the release of corticotropic releasing hormone,
suppresses appetite, induces fever and stimulates the
acute inflammatory response by enhancing the synthesis
of C-reactive protein and other mediators in liver. It also
induces vasodilation and loss of vascular permeability,
which is propitious for lymphocyte, neutrophil, and
monocyte infiltration and helps recruit these cells to the
inflammation site by regulating chemokine release. In
concord with IL-17, TNF-a can trigger the expression of
neutrophil-attracting chemokine, e.g. CXCL-1, CXCL2, and CXCL-5 [33] and augments the expression of cell
adhesion molecules [34]. This, in turn, increases CXCL2-dependent neutrophil migration to the inflammation
site. Similarly to TNF-a, IL-1β is produced and released
at the early stages of the immune response to infections,
lesions, and stress. During inflammation, it stimulates
the production of acute phase proteins from liver and
acts on the central nervous system to induce fever and
prostaglandin secretion. It also acts as a chemoattractant
for granulocytes, enhances the differentiation of CD4 T

cells [35], and increases the expression of cell adhesion
molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells. The
inflammatory response is beneficial for the host when these
cytokines are produced in appropriate amounts. However,
they become toxic when being produced in a deregulated
fashion. For instance, excess amounts of TNF-a play
pathological roles in inflammatory-related diseases such as
psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cancer, infectious
diseases, and other auto-immune pathologies. TNF-a and
IL-1β released from activated (M1) macrophages might
also contribute to NF-κB activation and form a vicious
circle in promotion of inflammation (Figure 8).
M2 macrophages are further subdivided into
M2a, M2b and M2c categories. M2a macrophages
are involved in the Th2 type immune response. M2b
macrophages are induced by IL-1, LPS and immune
complexes and are involved in regulating immunity. They
produce IL-10, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a. M2c macrophages
are induced by IL-10 and TGF-b and regarded as
deactivated or anti-inflammatory and participate in tissue
repair and remodeling. They produce large amounts of
IL-10 and TGF-b and express multiple receptors [36].
Thus, decreasing M1 macrophages and increasing M2
macrophages, and thus, significantly decreasing the
ratio of M1/M2 in EAT by CS might disrupt and stop the
vicious circle in promotion of inflammation. Base on the
differentiation of macrophages, we will use BMDMs, the
typical models for the studies on inflammation, to perform
subsequent experiments for further elucidation of underlying
mechanisms. In this study, we focused on macrophages. In
the subsequent study, we need to investigate whether other
types of immune/inflammatory cells are also involved in the
anti-inflammatory effects of CS.
In this study, we clearly demonstrated that CS
treatment inhibited HFD-induced expression of several
key components (IL-1b, Caspase-1, Nlrp3 and Asc) of
NLRP3 inflammasome at mRNA and protein level in EAT
(Figure 4A and 4B). Moreover, CS treatment markedly

inhibited HFD-induced caspase-1 and IL-1β production
in EAT (Figure 2). Furthermore, we also found that CS
inhibited ATP plus LPS- or MSU plus LPS-induced
activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in BMDMs of mice
or human THP-1 cells (Figure 5 and Supplementary
Figure 5). Therefore, we propose that NLRP3
inflammasome is one of the important targets of CS for
improving HFD-induced inflammation in adipose tissue.
It is well accepted that priming signal is needed for the
transcriptional regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In the
present study, BMDMs were stimulated with LPS for 4 h
at the priming step. It is a long duration of LPS stimulation.
However, it has been suggested that fast stimulation of
LPS (only 10 min) can prime the NLRP3 inflammasome
[37, 38], which is regulated by mitochondria-derived
reactive oxygen species (ROS). It was reported that
ATP or MSU, which activated NLRP3 inflammasome,
promoted ROS production, whereas scavengers of ROS
blocked activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [39, 40].
Therefore, ROS has been inferred to act on the upstream
of NLRP3 inflammasome. In future work, we will use
fast LPS stimulation to determine whether CS can affect
mitochondrial ROS production. NLRP3 inflammasome
was recruited into mitochondria when it was activated [41].
Thus, future work is also required to investigate whether
CS can affect the mitochondrial localization of NLRP3 in
BMDMs when they are stimulated with LPS and/or ATP.
ASC forms large aggregates known as pyroptosome or
“specks” when inflammasomes are activated [30]. Formation
of ASC pyroptosome is involved in the activation of
caspase-1 and processing of IL-1β. In this study, CS treatment
inhibited the formation of ASC pyroptosome induced by
LPS plus ATP in BMDMs (Figure 6A). Pyroptosis, a type
of programmed cell death, can destroy cell structure and
release LDH. We observed that CS treatment significantly
inhibited LDH release from BMDMs induced by LPS plus
ATP (Figure 6B). These are consistent with the reduction of
ASC pyroptosome formation and IL-1β production.

NF-κB pathway is a prototypical proinflammatory
signaling pathway, because NF-κB pathways are
involved in regulating the expression of a large number of
proinflammatory genes, such as cytokines, chemokines, and
adhesion molecules [42]. In this study, we also found that
CS treatment did not alter the protein levels of several key
components of NF-κB pathway, including NF-κB, IKK,
and IκB, but decreased the levels of their phosphorylated
forms, and thus, the ratios of pNF-κB/NF-κB, pIKK/IKK,
and pIκB/IκB in EAT of HFD-treated mice (Figure 4C and
Figure 3). Our results indicated that CS could inhibit the
NF-κB signaling, which is consistent with our previous
results [18, 19]. It was reported that circulating LPS was
increased in type-2 diabetic patients after a high fat meal
[43, 44]. The experiments with animals also demonstrated
that HFD increased circulating LPS [44]. Thus, it is
likely that HFD could activate NF-κB signaling via LPS
stimulation and that CS attenuated HFD-induced NFκB activation might be involved in the inhibition of LPS
stimulation. To confirm this possibility, we further used
BMDMs to repeat these experiments, and found that
CS inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation, nuclear
translocation and expression of its target genes such as
ptgs2, NOS2 and TNF-a (Figure 7).
We have shown that feeding mice with HFD
significant increased the expression levels of inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines including TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6,
CXCL-1, CCL-5, MCP-1 and SAA3 in EATs; Treatment
with CS-L and CS-H significantly inhibited HFD-induced
levels of these genes in EATs of HFD-fed mice in a dosedependent manner. CS treatment reduced NF-κB signaling
by significantly decreasing the phosphorylated forms and
the ratios of pNF-κB/NF-κB, pIKK/IKK, and pIκB/IκB in
EAT from HFD-fed mice as compared with those of HFD
mice. These results suggest that CS is involved in reducing
the activation of NF-κB signaling induced by HFD. In
the resting state, inactive NF-κB dimer complexes are
sequestered in cytoplasm due to the binding of inhibitory
IκB proteins. Upon being stimulated by physiological
and/or environmental stimulus, the IκB kinase (IKK)
complex consisting of two catalytically active kinases
(IKKα and IKKβ), is phosphorylated, which are then
targeted for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation,
leading to the releases of the bound NF-κB dimers. The
activated NF-κB dimers can translocate to the nucleus
where they mediate transcriptional activation of a large
number of down-stream genes [45]. NF-κB pathway
is generally devised into the classical canonical and
non-canonical NF-κB pathways [45]. In the canonical
activation pathway, excitatory signaling is mediated via
TNF receptor (TNFR), IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), Toll-like
receptors (TLRs), and antigen receptors. TNFα, IL-1β,
and LPS are typical stimulating signaling molecules
[46, 47]. Stimulation via these receptors results in
activation of IKK complex, which, in turn, phosphorylates
IκBα primarily by IKK2. Thus, inhibition of NF-kB
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathways by CS may be attributed to its suppression
of HFD-induced expression of TNFα, IL-1β and other
cytokines/chemokines. Thus, it is likely that the inhibition
of NF-kB pathway by CS is mediated by down-regulation
of TNF-a and IL-1b via the canonical NF-kB pathway.
Non-canonical NF-κB activation requires coordinated
assembly of a regulatory complex of the adaptors,
including cIAP1, cIAP2, TRAF2 and TRAF3 and the
kinase NIK [48] and is induced by TNF family cytokines,
involves IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of p100
associated with RelB, leading to partial processing of p100
and the formation of transcriptionally active p52-RelB
complexes. IKKα activation and phosphorylation of p100
depends on NIK, which is subject to complex regulation
by TRAF3, TRAF2 and ubiquitin ligases. In this study,
we did not investigate the effects of CS treatment on the
expression levels of these adaptors and factors. Whether
the inhibition of NF-kB pathways by CS is also mediated
through non-canonical NF-kB pathway by inhibiting the
expression and activities of these adaptors/factors remains
to be determined.
Based on the findings made in this study, we
concluded that CS could inhibit the adipose tissue
inflammation via the mechanisms, which might be
involved in suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome
activation and NF-κB signaling (Figure 8). It will also
be inferred that CS can provide protective effects on
many inflammatory diseases. NLRP3 inflammasome
activation needs two steps which are involved in different
mechanisms. The first step is the priming step in which
NLRP3 transcription is induced; and the second step is
posttranscriptional activation. NF-κB, the important
mediator of inflammation, plays a critical role for the
priming of NLRP3 inflammasome [49]. Thus, CS inhibits
the NLRP3 priming through inhibiting NF-κB signaling,
also via inhibiting the production of inflammatory
cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-1b.
While this study was mainly focused on examining
the effects of CS on inhibition of HFD-induced
inflammation in adipose tissue, we also found that CS
conferred similar inhibitory effects on inflammation in
human THP-1 cells and on inflammations induced by LPS
plus ATP- and MSU plus ATP-induced formation of NLRP3
inflammasome. These findings suggest that CS can confer
anti-inflammatory effects in other organs/tissues and other
diseases including cancer. It has been reported that activation
of NLRP3 inflammasome enhanced the proliferation and
migration of A549 lung cancer cells [50] and that obesityassociated NLRC4 inflammasome activation/IL-1 signaling
promoted breast cancer progression [51]. Obesity has been
linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer
and worse clinical prognosis [52] and is a risk factor for
TNBC [26]. Within the tumor microenvironment in the
context of obesity, an increase in tumor-infiltrating myeloid
cells is induced with an activated NLRC4 inflammasome,
which, in turn, activates IL-1β, driving disease progression
31035

Oncotarget

through enhancing the expression of adipocyte-mediated
vascular endothelial growth factor A and angiogenesis.
In mice treated with metformin, obesity-associated tumor
progression was inhibited and associated with a marked
decrease in angiogenesis [51], suggesting a useful basis
for treatment of patients with obese-related cancer by
blocking NLRC4 inflammasome activation and/or
IL-1β signaling transduction. Thus, CS and other main
components of SPJR, including Chikusetsu saponin V,
Chikusetsu saponin IV, Panax saponins Re, and Pjs-2, can
be explored to block activation of NLRC4 inflammasome
and/or IL-1β signaling transduction in patients with obeserelated cancer and TNBC. This possibility merits further
exploration.

The experimental protocols with mice were
schematically illustrated in Figure 1B. The mice were
randomly divided into four groups with 10 mice per group, fed
and treated as follows: normal diet (ND) containing 10% fat;
HFD containing 60% fat; HFD + CS-L (50 mg/kg of CS) and
HFD + CS-H (100 mg/kg of CS). CS was given by gavage.
For control, the mice in ND and HFD groups were given 0.9%
sodium chloride by gavage. The treatments were maintained
for 16 weeks (Figure 1B). During this period, the water
intake and food consumption were measured and recorded
daily while body weight was monitored weekly. At the end
of treatment, the mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation,
and their serum and liver samples were collected. The levels
of total cholesterol and triglyceride in serum and liver were
measured by the commercial kits according to the protocols
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The epididymal
adipose tissue (EAT) was isolated, weighted and stored at
−80°C for further analysis.

IKKα, phospho-NFκB p65(Ser536) and NFκB p65 were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA). Antibodies for IL-1β and NLRP3 were
purchased from abcam (Cambridge, UK). The food for
the mice was purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience
CO. LTD(Beijing, China). Other reagents were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich.

The EATs isolated from the experimental mice were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution for at least 24 h, and
embedded in paraffin. 5-μm serial sections were cut, and
then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE).

Ex vivo culture of EATs
The EATs isolated from the experimental mice
were minced into small pieces and seeded into 24-well
plates (0.8g/mouse) with serum-free DMEM medium,
supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/mL
penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. After culture
at 37°C under 5% CO2 for 24 h, the supernatants were
harvested. The levels of TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β and
caspase-1 in the supernatants were determined using
corresponding commercial ELISA kits.

Culture and stimulation of mouse bone marrow
derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human
THP-1 cells
BMDMs were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and
seeded in 10-cm dishes with DMEM medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 ng/ml colony
stimulating factor (CSF) at 37°C under 5% CO2. After
culture for 6 days, the adherent cells were collected and
served as BMDMs. They were stimulated with LPS at 0.2
μg/mL or 1 μg/mL as described previously [11, 53].
Human THP-1 cell line was initially obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA,

Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

The extraction of total RNA and cDNA synthesis
were performed as described in our previous studies
[54,  55]. SYBR Green Master Mix kit (Qiagen,
Netherlands) was used to perform real time PCR. The
amplification program was performed as follows: preincubation at 50°C, 2 min; denaturation at 95°C, 10
min; followed by subsequently by 40 cycles of 95°C,
15 sec; and 60°C, 60 sec. The mRNA expression level
was calculated by 2−ΔΔCt method, using GAPDH as the
endogenous control. The PCR primers were listed in
Supplementary Table 1 in the Supplementary materials.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
The extraction of nuclear protein was performed
following the commercial nuclear protein extraction kit
(Bayotime, Shanghai, China), and the protein level was
measured by Bradford method. The interaction between
CS and NF-κB was determined using Chemiluminescent
EMSA Kit (Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly, 32P-labeled
NF-κB oligonucleotide (5ʹ-GTTCGACAGAGGGGACTT
TCCGAGAGGCAAC-3ʹ) was incubated with equal
nuclear extract for 20 min. Each binding reaction system
was separated in 4% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred
onto the pre-soaked nylon membranes. The cross-linking
between the transferred DNA and membranes was
performed using a UV light cross-linker instrument. The
membranes were then blocked with blocking buffer for
15 min and finally analyzed by autoradiography.

Western blot analysis
Protein extraction from the tissues of mice or the
treated cells and its concentration measurement were
performed as described in previous studies [55, 56].
Denatured protein samples (50 μg/lane) were fractionated
in 4–15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The
membrane was blocked with 5% milk for 1 h, then
incubated with the indicated primary antibodies specific
to the target proteins overnight, and finally incubated with
one of the corresponding specific secondary antibodies
for 1 hr. Antibody for β-actin was served as the control.
The proteins bound by the specific antibody were detected
using ECL Super Signal reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA) and exposed to the X-ray film for autoradiography.

Statistical analysis
The data obtained from three independently repeated
experiments were presented as mean ± SD. Statistical
analyses were performed using Student’s t-test or oneway ANOVA analysis following Bonferroni post hoc
with SPSS 18.0 software. P < 0.05 was set for statistical
significance.
