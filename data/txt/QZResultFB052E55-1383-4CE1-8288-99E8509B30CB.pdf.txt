Abstract
Because the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
is commonly deregulated in human cancer, mTOR inhibitors,
rapamycin and its derivatives, are being actively tested in
cancer clinical trials. Clinical updates indicate that the
anticancer effect of these drugs is limited, perhaps due to
rapamycin-dependent induction of oncogenic cascades by an
as yet unclear mechanism. As such, we investigated rapamycin-dependent phosphoproteomics and discovered that 250
phosphosites in 161 cellular proteins were sensitive to
rapamycin. Among these, rapamycin regulated four kinases
and four phosphatases. A siRNA-dependent screen of these
proteins showed that AKT induction by rapamycin was
attenuated by depleting cellular CDC25B phosphatase. Rapamycin induces the phosphorylation of CDC25B at Serine375,
and mutating this site to Alanine substantially reduced
CDC25B phosphatase activity. Additionally, expression of
CDC25B (S375A) inhibited the AKT activation by rapamycin,
indicating that phosphorylation of CDC25B is critical for
CDC25B activity and its ability to transduce rapamycininduced oncogenic AKT activity. Importantly, we also found
that CDC25B depletion in various cancer cell lines enhanced
the anticancer effect of rapamycin. Together, using rapamycin
phosphoproteomics, we not only advance the global mechanistic understanding of the action of rapamycin but also show
that CDC25B may serve as a drug target for improving mTORtargeted cancer therapies. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2663–8]

Introduction
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a cellular 289 kDa
protein mediating signals derived from both growth factors and
nutrients and is known to regulate cell growth, proliferation, and
survival through controlling mRNA translation, metabolism,
ribosome biogenesis, and autophagy (1–3). The mTOR pathway
is commonly deregulated in human cancer. For example, in human
breast cancer, mTOR is commonly deregulated by loss of PTEN
(30% of human breast tumor; ref. 4), by mutation of PI3KCA
(18–26%; ref. 4), and by overexpression of Her2 (15–30%; ref. 5): all
of which are associated with a poor prognosis for breast cancer
patients (5–7). Similarly, in human prostate cancer, mTOR is
commonly deregulated by genetic aberrations such as low

expression of PTEN, increased PI3K activity, and increased
expression or activation of AKT in advanced prostate cancer
(8–10). These aberrations also are indicators of a poor prognosis
for prostate cancer patients (11, 12). More importantly, long-term
androgen deprivation treatment for prostate cancer patients that
reinforces the PI3K/AKT pathway also up-regulates mTOR
activation in prostate tumor (9, 10). These abovementioned
experimental and clinical data lead to the supposition that mTOR
inhibitors (rapamycin and its derivatives) should be effective in
treating human cancer. Unfortunately, recent clinical data indicates
that rapamycin shows therapeutic potential in only few types of
human cancer: endometrial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and
mantle cell lymphoma (13). These results could be explained by
recent findings that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin phosphorylates
and activates the oncogenic AKT and elF4E pathways while still
suppressing the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 (14) in
cancer cells. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms
regulating this rapamycin-dependent activation of oncogenic
cascades are not clear. Progress toward understanding the
underlying mechanisms is hindered by the limited number of
known cellular targets for rapamycin. We recently improved the
methodology for profiling the cellular phosphoproteome (15) and,
using this technology, simultaneously profiled 6,179 phosphosites
in cancer cells and identified 161 cellular proteins sensitive to
rapamycin. Within these proteins, there are four kinases and four
phosphatases, key mediators for cell signaling. We screened these
proteins and found that depletion of cellular CDC25B blocked
oncogenic AKT activation by rapamycin and enhanced the
anticancer effect of rapamycin. Interestingly, we also discovered
that a large percentage of the rapamycin-regulated proteins are
involved in regulation of cellular transcription. These results show
that rapamycin phosphoproteomics enables us to improve mTORtargeted therapies, as well as advance the general mechanistic
comprehension of rapamycin treatment in cancer.

(Invitrogen) containing 2 mmol/L L-Glutamine, 10% dialyzed FBS
(Invitrogen), and 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin was supplemented
with 100 mg/L L-Lysine and 20 mg/L L-Arginine, or 100 mg/L [U-13C6]-LLysine and 20 mg/L [U-13C6, 15N4]-L-Arginine (Invitrogen) to make the
‘‘Light’’ SILAC or ‘‘Heavy’’ SILAC culture medium respectively. HeLa cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were propagated
in SILAC medium for >9 generations to ensure nearly 100% incorporation of
labeled amino acids before the experiment was performed. Before cell
treatment, both heavy- and light-labeled cells were cultured overnight in the
corresponding SILAC medium without FBS. ‘‘Heavy’’ cells were treated for
15 min with epidermal growth factor (EGF; R&D Systems). ‘‘Light’’ cells were
pretreated with rapamycin for 1 h followed by addition of EGF. After being
washed with cold PBS buffer, HeLa cells were harvested and lysed in an
Extraction/Loading buffer from the TALON PMAC Phosphoprotein
Enrichment kit (Clontech) supplemented with 10 mmol/L sodium fluoride
and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche). Light cell lysate and Heavy
lysates were mixed at 1:1 ratio, and 16 mg of the mixed lysate was loaded
equally onto two phosphoprotein affinity columns (Talon PMAC; Clontech)
following the manual. The eluate was reduced with DTT and then alkylated
with iodoacetamide. The resulting solution was dialyzed against 1 mol/L
urea/100 mmol/L NH4HCO3 at 4jC overnight. The samples were digested
with trypsin (Promega). The digestion was subjected to solid phase
extraction by Extract-clean SPE C18 column (Alltech Associates) and later
lyophilized. The lyophilized peptide sample was loaded onto four IMAC
spin columns (Pierce Biotechnology). The IMAC-retained peptides were
then washed and eluted as recommended by the manufacturer’s manual.
Formic acid was added to the phosphopeptide-enriched eluate to a final
concentration of 4%, and the eluate was subsequently centrifuged to
remove any particulate matter before analysis by MudPIT(16).
Purified phosphopeptide samples were centrifuged to remove any
particulate matter before being analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) using an online high performance liquid chromatography system
(Nano LC-2D; Eksigent) coupled with a hybrid LTQ Orbitrap mass
spectrometer (Thermo Electron). The LC/LC and MS/MS were performed
as previously described (15).
Acquired MS/MS and MS/MS/MS spectra were subjected to SEQUEST
searches against the EBI-IPI human database (version 3.17 released

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

05-09-2006) attached with common contaminants (e.g., proteases and
keratins) with its reverse decoy for the assessment of false positive rates.
Phosphorylation searches were performed where serine, threonine, and
tyrosine were allowed to be differentially modified as previous described
(15). The SEQUEST identifications were additionally filtered using a false
positive cutoff by the DTASelect program based on XCorr and DeltaCN
scores using a reversed database approach (17). All identified phosphopeptides were subjected to relative quantification analysis using the program
Census (18). The Census program quantifies relative abundances of light
and heavy versions of precursor peptides identified by MS/MS and/or MS/
MS/MS spectra. The R-square statistics were calculated by regression
analysis of the profile of the heavy-peptide and the profile of the lightpeptide using the Census program. A P value for each phosphopeptide ratio
was calculated according to the distribution of peptide ratio measurements
of the 1:1 heavy/light mixed lysates.
siRNA-dependent function screen. Eighteen rapamycin-sensitive
kinases and phosphatases were screened for their ability to mediate AKT
activation by rapamycin. HeLa cells were individually transfected with
siRNAs (Dharmacon) of these kinases and phosphatases. After 72 h, these
cells were treated with 100 nmol/L rapamycin for 3 h. Western blot was
used to detect phosphorylation changes in AKT at Ser-473.
Phosphatase assays. Expression plasmid encoding Myc-tagged CDC25B
(a gift from Dr. Brian Gabrielli, University of Queensland, Queensland,
Australia) was transfected into HEK293 cells. After 48 h, CDC25B protein
was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody. These immunoprecipitates were incubated with 300 Amol/L 3-O-methyl fluorescein phosphate
(Sigma) in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 50 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L DTT,
and 20% glycerol for 15 min at 30jC. Hydrolysis of 3-O-methyl fluorescein
phosphate to OMF was monitored at 477 nm.
Dual luciferase assay. HeLa cells were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM
containing 2 mmol/L L-Glutamine and 10% FBS. Cells were cotransfected
with various promoter-firefly luciferase reporters (200 ng DNA per well) and
pRL-TK reporter (20 ng DNA per well) using GeneJet DNA In Vitro
Transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. After 24 h, cells were changed to serum-free medium and treated
with indicated reagents. The resultant cells were lysed and analyzed for
luciferase activity using the dual luciferase assay (Promega) according

Rapamycin Activates AKT through CDC25B
to the manufacturer’s instruction. All experiments were repeated at least
thrice with similar results.

Results
Rapamycin phosphoproteome generation and results.
Rapamycin inhibits the ability of mTOR protein kinase to
phosphorylate cellular proteins, thereby blocking the cancerous
signals derived from mTOR. Therefore, to profile rapamycinmodulated cellular proteins, we compare the phosphoproteome of
two growth factor induced–cell cultures pretreated with or without
rapamycin. Briefly, cells in normal medium (light culture) were
treated with rapamycin, and cells grown in medium containing
stable isotopes (heavy culture) were treated with vehicle. These
two populations of cells were stimulated with growth factor for
15 minutes, after which the 2 populations of cells were harvested,
mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and subjected to double IMAC purifications
followed by MudPIT LC/MS/MS analysis (15). Peptide sequences
were obtained from the MS/MS and MS/MS/MS spectra by
SEQUEST software. Phosphopeptides were obtained by filtering
total peptides by DTASelect 2.0 using the default settings, followed
by quantifying the abundance (peak area) of the light and heavy
phosphopeptides by CENSUS 1.05 using the default filter setting.
We detected 6,179 phosphosites derived from 1,751 phosphoproteins (Fig. 1A). As an example that this phosphoproteomic
profiling succeeded, the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6
(RPS6) at S235 and S236 is controlled by mTOR and inhibited by

rapamycin (19). Our rapamycin phosphoproteome data showed
that a phosphopeptide from RPS6 was phosphorylated at S235,
S236, and S240 and the phosphorylation was inhibited 8.33-fold by
rapamycin (Fig. 1B). This was verified by Western blotting using an
antiphospho RPS6 antibody (Fig. 1C).
To quantify the phosphorylation change for each phosphopeptide, we used the Census software to calculate area ratio, defined
as the ratio of the ‘‘light’’ peak area over the ‘‘heavy’’ peak area in
the chromatogram (Fig. 1B). An R-square statistic was provided to
indicate the accuracy of each area ratio measurement (Supplementary Table S1). The 1:1 mixed unenriched lysates were
analyzed by LC/LC-MS/MS to measure ratios of heavy and light
peptides. The distribution of the log ratios of base 2 of this 1:1
mixture was studied. The mean of the log 2 ratios is 0.0892, and
SD is 0.2546. Based on this distribution, the 2-j cutoffs are log 2
ratio > 0.4200 or log 2 ratio < 0.5984, corresponding to ratios of
>1.34 and <0.66, respectively. Because we believe that phosphopeptides more differentially expressed would also be more
biologically interesting, we chose to use a more stringent 2-fold
cutoff. Using >2 or <0.5 as the threshold for area ratio, we found
that the phosphorylation of 250 sites (161 proteins) of 6,179 sites
(1,751 proteins) was significantly modulated by rapamycin (Fig. 2A
and B). In other words, only f4% of the total phosphosites
detected showed significant alteration after rapamycin treatment.
Among these 250 rapamycin-sensitive phosphosites, only 3 have
been reported previously as downstream targets of mTOR (Fig. 2B;
ref. 19).

Figure 3. CDC25B mediates activation
of the oncogenic AKT pathway by
rapamycin. A, effect of CDC25B depletion
on AKT activation by rapamycin in cancer
cell lines. Cells were transfected with
CDC25B-specific smartpool siRNA (SP ),
duplex siRNAs (DP ), or control siRNAs for
60 h. Cells were then treated with
100 nmol/L rapamycin for 3 h. The
phosphorylation of AKT(S473), eIF4E
(S209), S6K1(T389), and expression of
CDC25B and GAPDH proteins were
detected by immunoblotting. B, HEK293
cells were transfected with empty vector
(EV ) or expression plasmids encoding
Myc-tagged WT or mutant CDC25B with
its Serine 375 mutated to Ala (S375A ).
Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells
were collected and phosphatase activities
of empty vector, WT, and S375A were
assessed as described in Materials and
Methods. Relative phosphatase activity
in these cells was normalized using
WT-transfected cells whose value was
taken as 100%. C, empty vector or
expression plasmids encoding WT or
mutant CDC25B, CDC25B (S375A), were
transfected into cells, followed by
100 nmol/L rapamycin stimulation. The
phosphorylation of AKT(S473),
S6K1(T389), and expression of CDC25B
and GAPDH proteins were detected by
immunoblotting.

Categorizing rapamycin-regulated proteins by their
activities and functions. To perceive the scope of rapamycin
action in cancer cells, we used the human protein reference
database to classify the 161 rapamycin-sensitive proteins by their
cellular activities and functions (Fig. 2C and D). Previous studies
indicated that rapamycin exerts its anticancer function by
inhibiting protein translation in cancer cells (20). Interestingly,
in our screen, the largest percentage (35%) of the rapamycinregulated proteins was involved in regulation of transcription and
not translation (6%; Fig. 2C). Additional examination showed that
32 of 345 (9.3%) transcription-related proteins and 6 of 112 (5.4%)
translation-related proteins detected in phosphoproteomic analysis
with their phosphorylation significantly altered by rapamycin
(Supplementary Table S1). Thus, rapamcyin has significant effect
on 9.3% of transcription regulators detected versus 5.4% of
translational regulators detected. These data suggested that the
cancer-inhibitory effect of rapamycin may also rely on its
regulatory role in mRNA transcription.
CDC25B mediates the activation by rapamycin of the
oncogenic Akt pathway. Kinases and phosphatases are critical
signal mediators and, thus, excellent cancer drug targets. We found
that rapamycin modulates four kinases and four phosphatases
(Fig. 2C) and suspected that these kinases/phosphatases may
transduce the oncogenic signal induced by rapamycin. We
screened these kinases/phosphatases for their ability to mediate
rapamycin-induced AKT and elF4E activation. We found that
silencing CDC25B phosphatase blocked the activation of AKT and
eIF4E by rapamycin in various human tumor cell lines (Fig. 3A).
Rapamycin induced phosphorylation of CDC25B at Serine 375
(Supplementary Table S1). To examine the effect of this
phosphorylation on the phosphatase activity of CDC25B, we
expressed either wild-type (WT) or a mutant form of CDC25B

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

[CDC25B (S375A)] in cells and subsequently analyzed their
phosphatase activity. We found that mutation of Serine 375 to
Alanine in CDC25B significantly attenuate its phosphatase activity
(Fig. 3B). We next expressed this CDC25B mutant in cells followed
by rapamycin treatment and found that CDC25B (S375A)
effectively blocked AKT activation by rapamycin, whereas WT
CDC25B did not (Fig. 3C). In UV-induced DNA damage, p38 is the
upstream regulatory kinase for CDC25B (21). However, silencing of
p38 did not affect the activation of AKT by rapamycin (Fig. 4A).
Instead, surprisingly, CDC25B knockdown blocked p38 activation
by rapamycin (Fig. 4B), indicating that p38 is downstream of
CDC25B in the activation of AKT. As blocking CDC25B inhibits
the activation of the oncogenic pathways, AKT and elF4E, by

Figure 4. CDC25B mediates activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase by rapamycin. A, depletion of cellular p38 has no effect in AKT activation

or control siRNAs as indicated, before being treated with 100 nmol/L rapamycin
for 15 min. Phosphorylation of AKT, S6K1, p38, and CDC25B was detected by
immunoblotting. GAPDH protein was used as loading control. B, CDC25B
depletion attenuated p38 activation by rapamycin. Cells were transfected with
CDC25B-specific siRNA or control siRNA for 60 h before treatment with 100 nmol/L
rapamycin for 15 min. Phosphorylation of p38 (T180/Y182), S6K1 (T389), and
expression of CDC25B were detected by immunoblotting.

Rapamycin Activates AKT through CDC25B

Figure 5. Cellular depletion of CDC25B enhances
the anticancer effect of rapamycin. CDC25B depletion
enhanced the growth-inhibitory effect of rapamycin in
different cancer cell lines. Cells were transfected with
CDC25B-specific siRNAs or control siRNAs for 24 h
followed by treatment with 100 nmol/L rapamycin for
another 48 h as indicated. Viable cell count was estimated

rapamycin, we hypothesized that CDC25B knockdown in tumor
cells should enhance the anticancer effects of rapamycin. To test
this, in the presence or absence of rapamycin, we knocked down
CDC25B in various types of cancer cells containing genetic
mutations (Supplementary Table S2) that augment or deregulate
the mTOR pathway. Moreover, as anti-mTOR treatment is only
effective in few types of human cancer (e.g., kidney cancer and
mantle B cell; ref. 13), we want to test whether our finding may
help enhancing the anti-mTOR treatment of some other kinds of
cancers such as prostate (Du145), breast (MCF7), non–small cell
lung (H157), and cervical (HeLa) cancers. We found that CDC25B
knockdown enhanced the antiproliferative effect of rapamycin on
cancer cells by 0.5- to 2.5-fold (Fig. 5). Furthermore, CDC25B
silencing only additively but not synergistically enhanced cell cycle
effect by rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data suggest
that CDC25B mediates the rapamycin-induced activation of AKT,
elF4E, and p38 cascades, and CDC25B knockdown significantly
promotes the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on the growth of
cancer cells not only through blocking cell cycle progression but
also by inhibiting oncogenic pathways activation by rapamycin.

Discussion
The CDC25 family of proteins is comprised of dual specificity
phosphatases that regulate cell cycle transitions, and are key
targets of the checkpoint machinery to maintain genome stability
(22) during DNA damage. Three isoforms of CDC25 have been
identified in mammalian cells: CDC25A, CDC25B, and CDC25C.
CDC25A and CDC25B overexpression has been reported in many
types of human cancers (22, 23) but is insufficient to cause cancer
(22), and the mechanism responsible for CDC25 overexpression
is unclear. Nevertheless, CDC25A and CDC25B overexpression
correlates with aggressive, high-grade, and late-stage tumors (22),
as well as with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (22, 24, 25),
possibly resulting from genome instability caused by the checkpoint-abrogating effect of their overexpression. However, CDC25
may contribute to tumorigenesis by other mechanism(s). Herein,
we discovered that the anticancer drug, rapamycin, induced the
phosphorylation of CDC25B at Serine 375, which is critical for its
phosphatase activity, and depletion of cellular CDC25B inhibited
the rapamycin-dependent activation of the survival/oncogenic
AKT, elF4E, and p38 pathways, suggesting that CDC25B phosphatase activity is required for the activation of Akt and/or p38. It is
possible that CDC25B might dephosphorylate and subsequently
activate the upstream regulator(s) of AKT and/or p38 but the exact
mechanism for this needs further investigation. Moreover, the
depletion of cellular CDC25B resulted in the augmentation of
anticancer effect of rapamycin on various types of tumor cells. This
result indicates that CDC25B is the key mediator for supplying

www.aacrjournals.org

survival/oncogenic signals to tumor cells during mTOR-targeted
cancer treatment and provide us with a potential drug target to
improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs rapamycin and its
derivatives.
It is well-known that the mTOR/Raptor (rapamycin-sensitive)
pathway is critical in modulating cellular translational machineries
thereby regulating physiologic and pathologic responses in cell.
However, the role of this pathway in altering cellular transcription
apparatuses has been emphasized much less. Interestingly, 35% of
the mTOR/Raptor-regulated cellular proteins identified herein are
transcriptional factors/transcription regulators and only 6% are
proteins controlling cellular translation processes (Fig. 2C). Further
analysis showed that 32 of 345 (9.3%) transcription-related proteins
and 6 of 112 (5.4%) translation-related proteins detected in
phosphoproteomic profiling have their phosphorylation levels
significantly altered by rapamycin (Supplementary Table S1). It
seems that the effect of the mTOR/Rapamycin pathway in altering
mRNA transcription and the consequent effect on gene expression,
biological function, and disease progression may has been underestimated. Further studies to clarify molecular mechanisms and
identify key cellular mediator(s) for these rapamycin-induced
phosphorylation alterations of transcription regulators should
facilitate the development of approaches to improve the efficacy
or reduce unwanted side effects during the mTOR-targeted cancer
therapies.
In conclusion, using rapamycin phosphoproteomics, we identified hundreds of novel rapamycin-targeted cellular proteins and
their phosphorylation sites. This information enabled us to identify
CDC25B as the key enzyme in mediating rapamycin induced
oncogenic AKT activation. Importantly, we show that phosphoproteomic profiling of a certain therapeutic agent cannot only
identify potential drug target(s) to improve the efficacy of that
therapeutic approach in disease treatment but also provide cellular
information of possible beneficial and adverse side effects of a
certain disease therapy when treating patients.
