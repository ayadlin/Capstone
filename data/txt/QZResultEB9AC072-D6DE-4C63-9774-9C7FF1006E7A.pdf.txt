ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is characterized by an increase in cellular energy metabolism,
which is predominantly satisfied by glucose and glutamine. Targeting metabolic
pathways is an attractive approach to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness and to
potentially overcome drug resistance in ovarian cancer. In platinum-sensitive ovarian
cancer cell lines the metabolism of both, glucose and glutamine was initially upregulated in response to platinum treatment. In contrast, platinum-resistant cells
revealed a significant dependency on the presence of glutamine, with an upregulated
expression of glutamine transporter ASCT2 and glutaminase. This resulted in a higher
oxygen consumption rate compared to platinum-sensitive cell lines reflecting the
increased dependency of glutamine utilization through the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
The important role of glutamine metabolism was confirmed by stable overexpression
of glutaminase, which conferred platinum resistance. Conversely, shRNA knockdown
of glutaminase in platinum resistant cells resulted in re-sensitization to platinum
treatment. Importantly, combining the glutaminase inhibitor BPTES with platinum
synergistically inhibited platinum sensitive and resistant ovarian cancers in vitro.
Apoptotic induction was significantly increased using platinum together with BPTES
compared to either treatment alone. Our findings suggest that targeting glutamine
metabolism together with platinum based chemotherapy offers a potential treatment
strategy particularly in drug resistant ovarian cancer.

development of drug resistance, in order to identify new
therapeutic approaches.
Like most cancers, ovarian cancer is dependent on
the increased utilization of energy sources to maintain
ATP levels and intermediates required for enhanced
cellular metabolism, cell growth and proliferation [5].
Glucose and glutamine are two main energy sources for
cancer cells [6]. Glucose is metabolized via increased
aerobic glycolysis, and the increased glycolytic flux to
lactate results in decreased pyruvate availability for the
mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Recent
evidence demonstrates that a number of malignant
tumors are glutamine dependent to maintain their

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type
of ovarian malignancy and often diagnosed in advanced
stages of disease. The standard treatment includes cytoreductive surgery followed by systemic platinum and
taxane-based chemotherapy [1]. The majority of women
who initially respond to chemotherapy relapse after firstline treatment and will ultimately develop resistance to
platinum based chemotherapy [2]. The development of
drug resistance contributes to a poor outcome of patients
with advanced stage ovarian cancer [3, 4]. Therefore, it is
important to understand the mechanisms involved with the

energy requirements [7]. A critical step in the utilization
of glutamine is its conversion to glutamate by the
mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase (GLS). Glutamate and
glutamate-derived metabolites can serve as intermediates
to supply the TCA cycle, generate glutathione and
contribute to fatty acid production [8, 9].
The MYC oncogene encodes the transcription factor
c-Myc which controls the expression of multiple key genes
involved in the regulation of metabolic pathways including
glycolysis and glutaminolysis [10]. Given the central role of
c-Myc in regulating metabolic pathways as well as cellular
growth it is a commonly amplified oncogene in many
hematologic and solid malignancies, including epithelial
ovarian cancer [11, 12]. However, the precise regulation of
glutamine metabolic pathways in cancers and its association
with c-Myc is not fully understood and little is known on the
role of glutamine metabolism in the development of drug
resistance in ovarian cancer. Recent studies have highlighted
the role of glutamine metabolic pathways in ovarian cancer
progression and high glutaminase (GLS) expression in
human tissue samples has been shown to be associated with
poor survival [13-15].
Much emphasis has been directed to the development
of glutaminase (GLS) inhibitors [16]. In pre-clinical studies,
inhibition of glutaminase (GLS) by either siRNA or via
the allosteric inhibitor, bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) delayed the growth of
various hematologic and solid tumors in vitro [17-21] and in
vivo [16, 17, 22, 23]. However, single agent treatments with
metabolic pathway inhibitors are unlikely to be curative, due
to adaptive mechanisms involving a switch in energy sources
in cancer cells.
In the present study, we further explored the
role of glutamine metabolism during platinum based
treatment of drug sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer.
We identified c-Myc as the upstream regulator increasing
the dependency of platinum resistant ovarian cancer cell
lines on glutamine metabolism via the TCA cycle and in
the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore,
we discovered that glutaminase (GLS) overexpression
confers platinum resistance and its inhibition via
BPTES re-sensitized platinum resistant cells. Our study
demonstrates that glutamine utilization is a critical step
in the development of platinum resistance in ovarian
cancer and that adding inhibitors of glutamine metabolic
pathway may be beneficial in the treatment of ovarian
cancer patients.

([H-3]GLN) during cisplatin treatment. We evaluated
two paired cell lines: the cisplatin sensitive A2780 cell
line and its cisplatin resistant derivative CP70, together
with the cisplatin sensitive OV81.2 cell line, which is a
primary cell line derived from a high grade serous ovarian
cancer patient. The cisplatin resistant derivative OV81.2CP10 (referred to as CP10 henceforth) was derived by
propagating OV81.2 cells in the presence of cisplatin for
10 passages thus selecting for resistant clones [24].
The baseline uptake of [C-14]deoxyglucose showed
little difference between the paired cisplatin sensitive
and resistant cell lines (Figure 1A), whereas the baseline
uptake of [H-3]glutamine was increased 2-fold in cisplatin
resistant CP70 cells compared to sensitive A2780 cells
and 3-fold in cisplatin resistant CP10 cells compared to
sensitive OV81.2 cells (p<0.01, Figure 1B). Interestingly,
both A2780 and OV81.2 showed a 1.5 – 2-fold increase in
radiolabeled [C-14]DG and [H-3]GLN uptake 48hr after
start of cisplatin treatment (p<0.01; Figure 1A, 1B). In
contrast, no change in glucose or glutamine uptake was
observed in the cisplatin resistant cell lines CP70 and
CP10 upon exposure to cisplatin (Figure 1A, 1B).
To better understand the mechanism regulating
the dependence on glutamine utilization in the cisplatin
resistant cell lines, we analyzed the expression of the high
affinity glutamine transporter (ASCT2) and glutaminase
(GLS), which converts glutamine to glutamate. Western
blot analysis showed increased expression of the
glutamine transporter ASCT2 and glutaminase (GLS)
in cisplatin resistant cell lines compared to the sensitive
cell lines (p< 0.01; Figure 1C), confirming the increased
utilization of exogenous glutamine in cisplatin resistant
cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed
increased ASCT2 and GLS expression in A2780 and
OV81.2 cells early during cisplatin treatment (p<0.01,
Figure 1D), which was maintained in cisplatin treated cells
at 48hr (Figure 1D). The expression of ASCT2 and GLS
was unaffected by cisplatin treatment in the resistant CP70
and CP10 cells, consistent with the lack of increased [H-3]
GLN uptake upon cisplatin treatment (Figure 1E). These
results suggest that cisplatin resistant cells have increased
glutamine requirements and upon cisplatin treatment,
glucose and glutamine utilization is increased in cisplatin
sensitive cells as well.

RESULTS

In order to determine the level of glutamine
dependency in cisplatin resistant cells we assessed the
effects of glutamine deprivation on cellular viability.
We found that cisplatin resistant CP70 cells were more
sensitive to glutamine deprivation showing a 40%
decrease in cell viability compared to 11% in the cisplatin
sensitive A2780 cell line after culture in glutamine free
media over 6hr (Figure 2A). Similarly, in the human

primary cell line OV81.2 cell viability was unaffected by
glutamine deprivation whereas the cisplatin resistant CP10
cells showed a 21% decrease in cell viability (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, the addition of glutamine after culturing
in glutamine free media for 6hr reversed the effects on
cell viability in the cisplatin resistant CP70 and CP10
cells but not in the cisplatin sensitive A2780 and OV81.2
cell lines (p<0.01, Figure 2B). These results suggest
that the cisplatin resistant CP70 and CP10 cells have a
higher glutamine dependency and rely more on glutamine
metabolism for survival. α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) is the
glutamine metabolite that enters the mitochondrial TCA
cycle. Addition of dimethyl α-KG, a membrane permeable
alpha-ketoglutarate analogue, reduced the cell death
observed in the CP70 and CP10 cell lines upon glutamine
deprivation (p<0.01, Figure 2A), suggesting that the
cisplatin resistant cell lines depend on glutamine to feed
the TCA cycle for subsequent cell survival.
The TCA cycle is directly linked to mitochondrial
respiration, which we measured by assessing the oxygen
consumption rate (OCR). We observed a 2-fold higher
OCR in cisplatin resistant CP70 cells compared to A2780
and a 3-fold higher OCR in cisplatin resistant CP10
cells compared to OV81.2 (p<0.01, Figure 2C, 2D). The
increased OCR is glutamine dependent, as blocking the
glutamine metabolism using the glutaminase inhibitor
BPTES (50 uM) reduced the OCR in the CP70 and CP10
cells to the level found in the corresponding platinum
sensitive cell lines (Figure 2C, 2D). Furthermore, the level

of OCR in the A2780 and OV81.2 cells was not reduced
when blocking glutaminase via BPTES (Figure 2C, 2D)
suggesting that the main energy source for mitochondrial
respiration in cisplatin sensitive cell lines is via glucose
derived pyruvate or fatty acids entering the TCA cycle. We
confirmed a direct role of GLS and glutamine metabolism
in driving mitochondrial respiration in cisplatin resistant
cells by over-expressing glutaminase in OV81.2 cells
(Figure 4A) or down regulating GLS expression in CP10
cells (Figure 5A) using lentivirus transfection. We found
a 2-fold increase in OCR in the OV81.2 cells overexpressing glutaminase compared to control, whereas
shGLS knockdown in the CP10 cells resulted in reduction
of OCR compared to the control shRNA cells (p=0.01,
Figure 2E).

C-Myc regulates glutamine metabolism in
cisplatin resistant cells
C-Myc has been shown to regulate metabolic
pathways and increase the expression of glutamine
transporters (ASCT2) and glutaminase (GLS) [8, 25, 26].
Western blot analysis showed increased c-Myc protein
expression in cisplatin resistant CP10 and CP70 cell
lines compared to the sensitive OV81.2 and A2780 cell
lines, respectively (Figure 3A). In addition, we found an
increasing c-Myc expression in both sensitive cell lines
after 24 and 48hr cisplatin treatment (2uM) (p< 0.01,
Figure 3A). To assess the direct effect of blocking c-Myc

A2780 and OV81.2 cells after 48 hr which was not observed in the cisplatin resistant CP70 and CP10 cell lines. No further increase in

on glutamine metabolism we used the c-Myc inhibitor
10058-F4, which inhibits the c-Myc-Max interaction and
prevents transactivation of c-Myc target gene expression.
As c-Myc is downregulating its own expression in a
feedback loop, we assessed the efficiency of 10058-F4
by reduction of c-Myc expression, which was abolished
after 24hr treatment with 50uM 10058-F4 in all cell
lines (P<0.01, Figure 3B). The expression of ASCT2
and glutaminase were also reduced with 50uM 10058F4 treatment after 24hr (P<0.01, Figure 3B), indicating
a functional role of c-Myc in regulating glutamine uptake
and utilization. Furthermore, inhibiting c-Myc in both,
CP10 and CP70 cell lines had a greater effect on reducing
glutamine uptake compared to the cisplatin sensitive
OV81.2 and A2780 cell lines (P<0.01, Figure 3C). Our
results suggest that the increased glutamine uptake in
platinum resistant cell lines is at least in part mediated by
the increased expression of c-Myc in these cell lines.

a significantly higher glutaminase expression in the
GLS transfected cells compared to empty vector control
(Figure 4A), and this over-expression is comparable to that
found in the corresponding cisplatin resistant cell lines.
Assessment of cell viability in the presence of increasing
concentrations of cisplatin showed that a higher expression
of glutaminase resulted in an increasing resistance to
cisplatin compared to the control transfected cells (Figure
4B and 4C). This resulted in a significantly higher IC50
value for cisplatin in the glutaminase over-expressing
cells compared to the transfected controls (A2780-control,
0.54uM+/-0.1; A2780-GLS, 1.18+/-0.04 (p<0.001) and
OV81.2-control, 1.5+/-0.15; OV81.2-GLS 2.2+/-0.2
(p<0.001)). To determine if the increased resistance to
cisplatin in the glutaminase over-expressing cell lines was
mediated by reduced apoptosis we assessed the percentage
of annexin V positive apoptotic cells. Glutaminase overexpressing cells had significantly reduced apoptosis in the
presence of cisplatin treatment compared to the control
cells (60% and 73% in A2780-control and OV81.2control compared to 35% and 36% in the A2780-GLS
and OV81.2-GLS, respectively) (Figure 4D and 4E).
The reduced apoptosis upon cisplatin treatment in the
glutaminase over-expressing cells was similar to the level
of apoptosis seen in the corresponding resistant cell lines
(Figure 4D and 4E).

Expression of glutaminase contributes to
cisplatin resistance

glutaminase (GLS) expression on cisplatin resistance

The role of glutaminase in cisplatin resistance
was further investigated by suppressing the expression
of GLS using shRNA. CP10 cells were transduced with
a lentivirus containing shRNA against GLS (shGLS) or
a lentivirus containing a control shRNA. Immunoblot
analysis confirmed that the GLS shRNA effectively
reduced glutaminase protein expression in resistant
cells, which was comparable to the level in the cisplatin
sensitive cell lines (Figure 5A). This level of reduction
lead to a statistically significant increase in cisplatin
sensitivity compared to the control shRNA cells (p<0.001,
Figure 5B). We further assessed if the increased sensitivity
to cisplatin in the glutaminase knockdown cells was due to
increased apoptosis. This was confirmed by the increased
annexin V positive cells in the CP10 shGLS cells in the
presence of cisplatin treatment compared to the control
cells (20% in CP10 shGLS compared to 10% in the CP10
shRNA control (Figure 5C).

with BPTES improves the therapeutic effectiveness of
cisplatin treatment and is re-sensitizing drug resistant
cells to the toxic effects of cisplatin. BPTES is a potent
and selective allosteric inhibitor against both splice
variants of the GLS gene, GAG and KGA, but not the
hepatic form of glutaminase encoded by the GLS2 gene
[23, 27]. In our paired cisplatin sensitive and resistant cell
lines, isobologram and combination index (CI) analysis
of BPTES and cisplatin combination revealed that these
drugs work in a synergistic manner in all cell lines tested
(CI range from 0.2-0.5, p<0.01 vs. either alone, Figure
6A-6D). This synergistic interaction resulted in increased
apoptosis in the BPTES and cisplatin combination
compared to single treatments (p<0.01, Figure 6E and
6F). These results support the approach of targeting the
glutamine metabolism in addition to cisplatin treatment to
improve therapeutic effectiveness in ovarian cancer.

To validate the clinical relevance of our findings,
we analyzed the relationship between glutaminase and

outcome of ovarian cancer patients using the PrognoScan
database [28]. In three independent publicly available
microarray datasets of ovarian cancer patients [13-15], we
found a significant correlation between higher levels of

differential expression of microRNAs such as miR-181a
[30]. More recently several studies have highlighted the
importance of altered glucose or fatty acid metabolism in
mediating resistance to chemotherapy or targeted therapies
[31-38]. Despite increased knowledge about the biology of
platinum resistance, improved therapy in ovarian cancer
has been lacking due to the complexity of the mechanisms
involved and cross-talk and redundancy of governing
signaling pathways [39, 40].
Within cell signaling pathways, the c-Myc transcription
factor is a main regulator of energy metabolism and is
often amplified or overexpressed in many types of cancers
including ovarian cancer [8, 41]. Studies have demonstrated
that c-Myc triggers cellular dependency on glutamine to feed

DISCUSSION
Current platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian
cancer falls short due to the common development of
drug resistance. This is often related to reduced platinum
accumulation in ovarian cancer cells, linked to increased
expression of multidrug resistance associated transporters
[29]. In ovarian cancer, platinum resistance has also
been associated with an increase in stem-like properties
mediated by upregulated Wnt signaling [24] and

the TCA cycle and increases anabolic pathways [8, 17, 25].
c-Myc expression has also been associated with platinum
resistance in various cancer types [42-45] for example via
repression of c-MYC inhibitor bridging integrator 1 [44]
or increased platinum accumulation in cells [43]. ReyesGonzalez et al. recently reported shorter disease-free and
overall survival in ovarian cancer patients with higher levels
of c-Myc gene expression [45]. The group demonstrated that
therapeutic siRNA-mediated silencing of c-Myc resulted in
a significant reduction in tumor growth and induction of
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell lines
and murine xenograft models [45]. Our results suggest a
potential additional mechanism of c-Myc induced platinum
resistance in ovarian cancer through increased cellular
utilization of glutamine. We have shown that the c-Myc
expression is upregulated in platinum resistant compared to
sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines. In addition, we found an
upregulation of c-Myc in platinum sensitive cell lines during
platinum treatment. c-Myc has been shown to regulate
glutaminolysis by directly activating the expression of genes
involved in glutamine metabolism such as the amino-acid
transporter ASCT-2 and glutaminase (GLS) [7, 8] as well as
regulating GLS through post-transcriptional mechanisms by
repressing the transcription of miR-23a/b [26]. Consistent
with this, we demonstrated that the effective inhibition of
c-Myc with 10058-F4 in human ovarian cancer cell lines
correlated with reduced glutaminase and ASCT-2 protein
levels and subsequently reduced radiolabeled glutamine
uptake.
A key finding of our study is the glutamine
dependency of platinum resistant ovarian cancer cell
lines. Platinum resistant cells were approximately 4-times
more sensitive to glutamine deprivation compared to
sensitive cells. In addition, platinum resistant cells were
characterized by upregulated expression of important
proteins in the glutamine metabolic pathway including
glutamine transporter ASCT2 and glutaminase (GLS)
(Figure 1C). We also found increased glutamine uptake
and glutamine dependent TCA oxidative phosphorylation
in platinum resistant compared to sensitive ovarian cancer
cells. Underscoring the clinical significance of these
findings, high glutaminase gene expression correlated
with poor patient outcome in three independent publicly
available microarray datasets of ovarian patients which we
analyzed through the PrognoScan database (Figure 7) [1315, 28]. Furthermore, both GLS and ASCT2 expression
were increased in platinum sensitive cell lines treated with
platinum, showing upregulated glutamine metabolism as
an early event in response to platinum treatment.
To further evaluate the effect of different levels of
glutaminase (GLS) expression on resistance to platinum
we suppressed the expression of GLS using shRNA
in platinum resistant cells and over-expressed GLS in
platinum sensitive cell lines. Targeted inhibition of GLS
resulted in a significant increase in platinum sensitivity
compared to the control shRNA cells. Conversely,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

enhanced expression of GLS resulted in increased
platinum resistance compared to the control transfected
cells and significantly reduced apoptosis in the presence of
platinum. Intriguingly, an increased glutamine dependency
was recently linked to enhanced in vitro migratory and
invasive capabilities in a panel of eight ovarian cancer cell
lines [46]. Using transwell invasion and wound-healing
assays, the authors showed that glutamine independent cell
lines OVCAR3, IGROV1 and OVCA429 had low invasive
capacities, whereas highly glutamine dependent SKOV3,
SKOV3ip and Hey8 ovarian cancer cell lines had highest
invasive capacities. In line with their levels of glutamine
dependence, SKOV3 had a 4-fold higher expression of
glutaminase (GLS1) compared to OVCAR3. Using in-vivo
xenograft tumor models, GLS1 gene silencing by siRNA
significantly reduced both tumor weight and tumor volume
in Gln-dependent SKOV3ip1 tumor-bearing animals,
whereas it did not affect the volume of Gln-independent
IGROV1 tumors. In addition, when analyzing tissues of
139 ovarian cancer patients by immunohistochemistry,
the group found an association between higher protein
expression of GLS1 and reduced overall survival [46].
In this present study we uncover that the therapeutic
inhibition of glutamine metabolism using glutaminase
(GLS) inhibitors reversed platinum resistance and
demonstrated synergistic efficacy in combination with
cisplatin chemotherapy. BPTES (bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide) is a potent and selective
allosteric inhibitor against both splice variants of the
GLS gene, GAG and KGA, but not the hepatic form of
glutaminase encoded by the GLS2 gene, thus avoiding
hepatic toxicity [23, 27]. The combination of platinum and
the GLS inhibitor BPTES was markedly more effective
than either agent alone in cisplatin sensitive or resistant
human ovarian cancer cell lines (Figure 6A-6D). Of note,
for the synergistic interaction, BPTES was required to
be added several hours prior to platinum treatment and
the clinical implications of this observation are not yet
known. The combination treatment had a profound effect
on cell survival, inducing apoptotic death and overcoming
platinum resistance. A similar glutaminase inhibitor, CB839 (Calithera Biosciences, Inc., South San Francisco,
CA) was recently shown to display significant antitumor
activity in two xenograft models of triple negative and
basal-like HER2-positive breast cancer as a single agent and
in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy [16]. Further
studies are needed to determine whether the observed
synergistic effect of glutaminase inhibition in ovarian
cancer is specific to platinum chemotherapy. Our novel
finding that targeting glutamine metabolism can reduce or
reverse platinum resistance has a high potential for clinical
translation, since oral glutaminase inhibitors such as CB839 are currently being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials
in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT02071862;
ClinicalTrials.gov) and hematological malignancies
(NCT02071888; ClinicalTrials.gov).

Cell lines

An important strength of our work is the utilization
of two complementary ovarian cancer cell lines. We used
the A2780/CP70 paired platinum sensitive and resistant
cell line and also assessed a human primary cell line
isolated from a patient with newly diagnosed high grade
serous ovarian cancer (OV81.2). From this cell line we
generated in vitro a platinum resistant cell line (CP10).
These cell lines combine the advantages of I) utilizing a
more artificial but long established and well-characterized
model system of platinum resistant ovarian cancer (A2780/
CP70) with the advantages of II) using a novel primary
patient-derived cell line. Furthermore, these two cell lines
represent the two most common histologic subtypes of
human ovarian cancer, high-grade serous (OV81.2) and
endometrioid (A2780; [47, 48]) which together account
for more than 90% of human ovarian cancer cases, thereby
making our results highly clinically relevant.
In conclusion our work provides the first evidence
for increased glutamine dependency of platinum
resistant ovarian cancer cells and demonstrates that
targeting glutamine metabolism together with platinum
based treatment offers a potential therapeutic strategy
particularly in platinum resistant ovarian cancer.
Nevertheless, cancer cells can readily switch energy
sources [17] and utilize compensatory pathways.
Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target
different metabolic pathways together with platinum
chemotherapy may provide a more effective cytotoxic
combination while reducing the development of
resistance. Changes in tumor metabolic activity can
be non-invasively assessed via positron emission
tomography (PET). PET biomarkers for both, glucose and
glutamine metabolism are either in routine clinical use
or currently being evaluated in clinical trials [49-51, 5256]. In future clinical trials, non-invasive PET imaging of
glucose and glutamine metabolic pathways could be used
to visualize net changes in a tumor’s energy consumption
and detect a potential switch in tumor metabolic activity
early during therapy. A molecular imaging guided
approach to metabolic pathway inhibition could provide
a rationale for individualized combinations of metabolic
pathway inhibitors and chemotherapy and potentially
improve the outcome of ovarian cancer patients.
Further in vivo studies of targeting glutamine
metabolism in combination with platinum chemotherapy
are warranted and may set the stage for subsequent clinical
trials to exploit the glutamine dependency of platinum
resistant ovarian cancer.

Human ovarian cancer paired platinum sensitive
and resistant cell lines A2780 (cisplatin sensitive)
and CP70 (isogenic cisplatin resistant to A2780), and
OV81.2 (cisplatin sensitive) and CP10 (isogenic cisplatin
resistant to OV81.2) were provided by Dr. A. DiFeo. The
OV81.2 cell line was previously generated by Dr. DiFeo
from the ascites of a patient diagnosed with high grade
serous ovarian cancer who was platinum sensitive. The
platinum resistant derivative of OV81.2, namely, CP10,
was generated by propagating OV81.2 in the presence
of 2.5μM cisplatin for 10 passages in vitro as previously
described [24]. After selection for acquired platinum
resistance CP10 cells are grown in the absence of cisplatin.
Cell lines were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco’s
modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. Glucose and glutamine free
medium supplemented with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine
serum was used in the in vitro uptake assays.

Lentiviral transduction
GLS over expression was achieved by stable
transduction with Lentivirus, using the vector containing
the sequence of GLS1 in the pEZ-Lv105 vector (EXH0487-Lv105-10; GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA).
Control plasmid consisted of pEX-NEG-Lv105. Gene
knockdown was achieved by stable transduction with
Lentivirus, using the vector psi-LVRH1GP containing
a GLS specific short hairpin RNA or control sequence
(HSH007722-LVRH1GP; GeneCopoeia, Rockville,
MD, USA). The transduced cells were enriched by
puromycin (3ug/ml) selection as well as GFP in the case
of knockdown. Protein over expression or knockdown was
confirmed by Western blot.

Cell viability assay

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The growth inhibitory effects of cisplatin, BPTES
and 10058-F4 were measured using the Vi-CELL trypan
blue exclusion counter (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis,
IN, USA). Cells were plated out in 6 well plates (Corning,
NY, USA) at 1 x 105 cells per well the night before drug
treatment. Cells were then incubated with different drug
concentrations or combinations as stated for 48 hr. Viable
cell numbers from triplicate wells were determined using
the Vi-CELL counter, and IC50 values were calculated
using GraphPad Prism Software Version 5 (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and plotted in dose
response curves.

Reagents

Annexin V staining

Cisplatin, glutaminase inhibitor BPTES, and c-Myc
inhibitor 10058-F4 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA).

Cells (1 x 105) were seeded in 6 well plates and
allowed to adhere overnight before incubation in the
presence or absence of cisplatin, BPTES or combinations

for 48 or 72 hr. Cells were detached using versene, washed
in PBS and resuspended in 1X annexin buffer. FITC
annexin V and PI (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
were added and incubated for 15 minutes in the dark.
Annexin V Alexa Fluor 647 was used for GFP expressing
cell lines. The cells were analyzed using the BD LSR II
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

The rate of change of dissolved O2 (oxygen
consumption rate, OCR) was determined using the XF24
Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, MA, USA). Drug-treated
cells were harvested and 100,000 cells were plated out
on the cellTak (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
treated microplates. The rate of change of dissolved O2
in the medium immediately surrounding the cells was
measured using the XF24 Analyzer. The contribution
of glutamine in oxidative phosphorylation was assessed
using specific inhibitors to glutamine metabolism or stable
over expression or knockdown of GLS.

Protein expression
Protein was isolated from cells using lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 μm EDTA pH 8
0.5% Np40 and 10% glycerol). Lysates were standardized
for protein content and 20 μg of total protein was
separated by a gradient 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel (Mini-PROTEAN TGX, Bio-Rad, CA, USA)
electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes
using the iBlot system (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher
Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA). The membranes
were blocked and primary antibody was diluted 1:1000
in 3% BSA in TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (TBST)
and incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, blots
were washed in TBST buffer and incubated with goat
anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 1 hr at room
temperature. After washing in TBST buffer (three times,
10 min per wash) the immunoreactive proteins were
visualized using ECL detection reagent (Amersham,
GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
The antibodies used were anti-ASCT2 (V501, Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) and anti-c-Myc (D84C12,
Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-glutaminase
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-β-tubulin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA).

PrognoScan analysis
Using the PrognoScan database (http://www.
prognoscan.org/) and publicly available Gene Expression
Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) datasets with
the accession numbers GSE 9891, GSE 26712, and GSE
17260, the relationship between GLS expression levels and
overall or progression free survival rates was evaluated in
ovarian cancer patients [13-15, 28]. Patients were stratified
into two groups according to their intratumoral GLS
expression at various cutoffs, and the cutoff point yielding
the most significant survival difference by log-rank test is
presented in the Kaplan Meier analysis.

Statistical analysis
Quantitative parameters are reported as mean
values and standard deviation (SD). Differences between
treatment groups or experimental factors were assessed
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using GraphPad Prism
Software Version 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla,
CA, USA) at a two-sided 5% significance level.

In vitro tracer uptake assays

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Cells were plated at 1 x 105 cells per well the
evening before the experiment. The next day cells
were incubated with drug for 24hr (c-Myc inhibition)
or 48hr (cisplatin). On the day of the assay, the drugcontaining media was removed and cells incubated
in glucose/glutamine free media supplemented with
2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum containing [C-14]DG
and [H-3]GLN at 1 μCi/ml to each well and incubated
for 20 mins. Cells were then washed twice in ice cold
PBS, harvested with trypsin, and viable cell numbers
determined using the Vi-CELL counter. The cell lysates
were collected and added to tubes containing 2 ml of
scintillation fluid and the cell associated [C-14] and [H3] radioactivity was measured using the β scintillation
counter (LKB Instruments, Mount Waverly, Victoria,
AU). Radioactivity uptake is expressed as nanomoles
uptake of tracer per 10 000 live cells and expressed
relative to untreated controls. All experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated 3 times.
