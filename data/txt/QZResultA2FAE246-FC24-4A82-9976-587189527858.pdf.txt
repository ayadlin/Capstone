BACKGROUND: Indolent nonfollicular non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (INFLs) are clonal mature B-cell proliferations
for which treatment has not been defined to date. METHODS: In this phase 2 study of patients with advanced INFL,
the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide (FCR) as
induction immunochemotherapy (rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 of each cycle and on days 1 and 14 of
cycles 4 and 5; fludarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2-4, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2 intravenously on
Days 2-4) every 28 days for 6 cycles followed by a maintenance phase with 4 infusions of rituximab (375 mg/m2
intravenously on day 1) every 2 months for responders. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled. Among 46
evaluable patients (28 men; median age, 59 years), 19 were diagnosed with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, 21 were
diagnosed with small lymphocytic lymphoma, and 6 were diagnosed with nodal marginal zone lymphoma. The overall
response rate after maintenance was 89.1% with a 67.4% complete remission (CR) rate (CR/unconfirmed CR) and a
21.7% partial response rate. After a median follow-up of 40.9 months, the failure-free survival and progression-free
survival rates both were 90.1%, and the overall survival rate was 97.4%. The main toxicity was hematologic, and
related grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed in 55.3% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: FCR induction therapy followed by a short maintenance phase is a highly effective regimen with acceptable toxicity. Cancer 2012;118:3954-61.

INTRODUCTION
Indolent nonfollicular non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (INFL) are clonal mature B-cell proliferations that include a
heterogenous group of diseases, such as small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytic (LPC) lymphoma, and
marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).1 Their treatment traditionally has been derived from that for chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL), and only retrospective studies or prospective trials involving limited numbers of patients have been
published to date.2-9
Alkylating drugs, in particular chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide, long have been the mainstay of therapeutic
strategies in INFL.10 Subsequent studies evaluating their combination with other classes of drugs, for example, vinca

alkaloids (vincristine) and/or anthracyclines (doxorubicin), did not produce any improvement in outcomes.11
From the 1990s, several studies demonstrated that the purine analog fludarabine was superior to chlorambucil12
and to alkylating-containing regimens (with or without
anthracyclines)13,14 in terms of the number of complete
remissions and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients
with treated and untreated CLL. On the basis of the synergistic activity demonstrated in vitro, the combination of
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) has been studied
extensively in CLL, resulting in an improvement in the
rates of clinical response, complete response (CR), and
PFS.15-17 Nevertheless, there is a paucity of information
on the efficacy of FC therapy in other indolent subtypes
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).18-21
Recently, the Italian Lymphoma Study Group
(GISL) published results from their LL02 trial22 in which
treatment-naive patients with advanced INFL were treated
with the FC combination, reflecting the results described
above for CLL, despite some degree of hematologic toxicity. Moreover, fludarabine combinations with cyclophosphamide and/or mitoxantrone reportedly were highly
effective as first-line treatment for advanced follicular lymphomas.23,24 These findings suggested that fludarabinecontaining regimens may be suitable for combination with
rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the
CD20 antigen that has dramatically changed the therapeutic strategy for patients affected by B-cell malignancies.25
Indeed, the combination of rituximab with FC (FCR) has
greatly improved response rates in patients with treated and
untreated CLL.26-30 In particular, it has been demonstrated
that FCR as first-line treatment increases overall survival
(OS), thus establishing a new treatment paradigm that may
improve the natural course of the disease.30
A few studies have analyzed the use of FCR in
patients with indolent NHL and have demonstrated that
this combination is highly active as initial or salvage therapy.31-34 The role of rituximab also has been established
in maintenance treatment for indolent NHL; Hainsworth
et al35 concluded that 4 doses of rituximab at 6-month
intervals after up-front induction therapy using a standard, 4-week course increased the overall response rate
(ORR), the CR rate, and PFS compared with the rates
reported with standard, 4-week treatment alone. Likewise,
Ghielmini et al36 demonstrated an event-free survival
advantage for patients with follicular NHL who were
received 4 additional doses of rituximab compared with
those who received no further treatment after the initial
standard 4 doses.

On the basis of these findings, the GISL and the Italian Lymphoma Intergroup (now the Italian Lymphoma
Foundation) conducted the ML18324 trial. Begun in
2005, the objective of this single-arm, multicenter, openlabel, phase 2 trial was to evaluate the activity of induction
FCR immunochemotherapy followed by 4 maintenance
doses of rituximab every 2 months for a total of 8 months
in patients with advanced INFL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial
aimed to evaluate the activity of induction immunochemotherapy with FCR (6 cycles of FC and 8 doses of rituximab) followed by 4 maintenance doses of rituximab every
2 months in patients with advanced and untreated INFL
(Clinical trial registration number 2004-002733-39).
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of this treatment regimen in terms of the percentage
of failure-free patients after 2 years from the start of treatment. Secondary objectives were to evaluate this regimen
in terms of tumor response (CR, unconfirmed CR [CRu],
and partial response [PR]), failure-free survival (FFS),
OS, PFS, disease-free survival (DFS) in patients who
achieved CR/CRu after induction therapy, and duration
of response in patients who achieved at least a PR after
induction therapy; to evaluate the activity of the induction
immunochemotherapy in terms of tumor response (CR,
CRu, and PR); to assess the safety of induction immunochemotherapy; and to assess the safety of maintenance
therapy with rituximab.
The study was conducted at 10 centers in Italy. The
study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of
each institution. All patients provided written informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
This study was funded by Roche S.p.A (Monza, Italy).
Eligibility Criteria
Patients ages 18 to 65 years who were diagnosed with
INFL (including SLL, LPC/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and nodal MZL) according to the World Health
Organization classification of tumors of hematopoietic
and lymphoid tissues,1 demonstrated by histopathology
and/or bone marrow biopsy, were included. Additional
inclusion criteria were the following: no previous treatment received, stage III or IV disease or stage II disease
with >3 involved sites, and fulfilling at least 1 criterion
for the definition of active disease (including systemic

symptoms, hemoglobin <10 g/dL because of lymphoma,
platelets <100  109/L because of lymphoma, diffuse
bone marrow infiltrate, lymphocyte doubling time <12
months in leukemic patients, bulky disease >7 cm, or a
doubling of the greatest dimension of at least 3 measurable sites in <12 months). Patients had to have adequate
hepatic function (total bilirubin 2 times the upper limit
of normal [ULN]; higher values were admitted if related
to localization of the disease; alkaline phosphatase 2
times the ULN; and transaminase levels 3 times the
ULN), renal function (creatinine 2.0 times the ULN),
and cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction
45%); an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 2, and a life expectancy
>6 months. Fertile patients had to use contraception. Key
exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of MZL of splenic
or mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue origin and CLL.
Study Treatment
Enrolled patients began the induction phase and received
1 cycle of FCR immunochemotherapy (consisting of rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 of each cycle
and on days 1 and 14 of Cycles 4 and 5; fludarabine 25
mg/m2 intravenously on days 2-4; and cyclophosphamide
250 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2-4) every 28 days, for
a total of 6 treatment cycles (months 1-6 of the study). In
Cycle 1, to avoid cytokine release syndrome, rituximab
was given on day 8; and, consequently, fludarabine and
cyclophosphamide were given on days 1, 2, and 3. Before
rituximab infusion, patients were pretreated with paracetamol and either chlorpheniramine, chlorphenamine, or
similar drugs according to the standard practice of each
center. At the end of the third cycle of FCR (month 4 of
the study), patients were evaluated for tumor response
(clinical assessment; ie, physical examination, laboratory
tests, and ultrasonography or chest x-ray of involved sites).
Patients who had stable disease (SD) or progressive disease
(PD) were withdrawn from the study. One month after
administration of the final course of FCR (month 7 of the
study), patients were evaluated for tumor response (complete assessment; ie, physical examination, laboratory
tests, chest and abdominal computer tomography studies,
bone marrow biopsy), and patients who had SD or PD
were withdrawn from the study. Patients in CR/CRu or
PR began the maintenance phase (months 8-16 of the
study) and received 4 infusions of rituximab (375 mg/m2
intravenously) on day 1 every 2 months for a total of 8
months (months 8, 10, 12, and 14 of the study). One
month after administration of the second maintenance

3956

dose of rituximab (month 11 of the study), patients were
evaluated for tumor response (clinical assessment). Two
months after the administration of the last dose of rituximab (month 16 of the study), patients were evaluated
for tumor response (complete assessment). During the
follow-up phase, patients again were evaluated for tumor
response (complete assessment) at months 28 and 40. At
month 22, 34 patients were evaluated for tumor response
with clinical assessment only.
Patients received prophylactic antibiotic treatment
with cotrimoxazole (2 tablets 3 times weekly) from the beginning of chemotherapy (FC) to 3 months after chemotherapy; additional prophylaxis with levofloxacine or
ciprofloxacine and itraconazole were administered in
patients who had neutropenia <1.0  109/L. In addition,
patients received supportive care as needed, including
antibiotics, blood transfusion, drugs to prevent tumor
lysis syndrome, immunoglobulin replacement, erythropoietin, and hematopoietic growth factors.
Efficacy Assessments
CR, PR, SD, and PD were evaluated according to the first
version of the criteria published by Cheson et al.37 In
patients who had initial bone marrow involvement, clearance of bone marrow from lymphoma had to be documented with bone marrow biopsy, normalization of
blood counts with granulocytes >1.500/lL, hemoglobin
>12 g/dL, and platelets >100,000/l L.
Statistical Analysis
This was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 2
study. According to previous findings on the treatment of
INFL,11 this trial was planned assuming 45% failure-free
patients using standard treatment after 2 years from inclusion in the study. An advantage of approximately 25%,
which corresponds to a 55% risk reduction, was expected
with FCR induction followed by rituximab maintenance
based on previous phase 2 studies that used the FC combination in patients with INFL22 and the FCR combination
in patients with CLL. Considering a 2-tailed statistical
test with an alpha error of .05 and a statistical power of
90%, the requirement for the study was 40 analyzed
patients, and there were 47 patients enrolled. The safety
population consisted of all enrolled patients who received
at least 1 dose of study treatment. The efficacy analysis
was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population,
which was defined as those patients who completed at
least 2 cycles of treatment. FFS was measured from the
date treatment was started to the date of documented

disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause. OS
was calculated from the date treatment was started to the
date of death from any cause. PFS was measured from the
date treatment started to the date of documented PD.
DFS was defined for all patients who achieved a CR (CR/
CRu) 1 month after completion of the induction phase of
treatment (month 7 of the study) and was measured from
the time of CR to the date of relapse. Response duration
was defined for all patients who achieved a response (CR,
CRu, and PR) 1 month after completion of the induction
phase of treatment (month 7 of the study) and was measured from the time of response until the date of progression or relapse. Time to event data (FFS, OS, PFS, DFS,
and response duration) were estimated using the KaplanMeier method. The ORR and the rates of CR, CRu, and
PR were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
The most severe grading according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0; dated December 12, 2003) among the individual adverse events (AEs)
was used.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between July 2005 and May 2007, 47 adult patients with
INFL were enrolled consecutively at 10 institutions. One
patient was excluded from the ITT analysis because he did
not complete 2 cycles of treatment, according to study
protocol. The main clinical and hematologic characteristics of the 46 remaining patients (28 men and 18 women;
ratio of men to women, 1.6; median age, 59 years; age
range, 31-65 years) are summarized in Table 1; among
them, 19 patients were diagnosed with LPC, 21 were
diagnosed with SLL, and 6 were diagnosed with nodal
MZL. The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) was used as a model considering the
heterogeneity of histotypes included and the absence of a
specific prognostic system. During the study, 3 of 47
enrolled patients dropped out during the induction phase,
2 because of AEs (1 for pneumonia and the other for progressive neuropathy), and 1 patient withdrew consent. Of
the 44 remaining patients, 3 patients dropped out during
the maintenance phase, 2 because of AEs (1 with systemic
amyloid disease and 1 with persistent pancytopenia) and 1
for other reasons (treatment delay from the previous therapy). Of the 41 remaining patients, 4 patients dropped
out during follow-up, 1 because of AEs (bladder cancer),
2 because of disease progression, and 1 for relapse (Fig. 1).
Thirty-seven patients completed the follow-up period.

median relative dose intensity during the induction and
maintenance phases were 90.7% and 88.14%, respectively. With respect to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, 91.5% of patients received the 18 planned doses,
and the median relative dose intensity was 93.9%; the fludarabine dose was reduced and/or was not administered
in 5.8% of the patients and in 3.6 of the cycles.
After the induction phase, 44 of 46 patients (95.7%)
had an objective response: The CR rate was 41.4%, the
CRu rate was 21.7%, and the PR rate was 32.6%. After
the maintenance phase, 41 of 46 patients (89.1%) had an
objective response: the CR rate was 47.8%, the CRu rate
was 19.6%, and the PR rate was 21.7% (Table 2). After a
median follow-up of 40.9 months, 1 patient (2.1%) had
died of disease progression. On the basis of an ITT analysis, at a median follow-up of 40.9 months, the FFS rate
was 90.1% (95% CI, 75.5%-96.2%), the PFS rate was
90.12% (95% CI, 75.5%-96.2%), the DFS rate was
87.70% (95% CI, 65.8%-96%) (Fig. 2), the OS rate was
97.4% (95% CI, 83.2%-99.6%), and response duration
rate was 90.7% (95% CI, 75.4%-96.2%).
Toxicity
In general, FCR was tolerated relatively well in the study
population. Fourteen patients (29.8%) required dose

modifications because of AEs that began at or after the first
administration of study treatment (treatment-emergent
AEs [TEAEs]). Thirty-six patients (76.6%) had at least 1
grade 3 or 4 TEAE: Their distribution throughout each
treatment cycle is listed in Table 3. The main toxicity was
hematologic and was observed in 30 patients (63.8%) (Table 4); in particular, related grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was
observed in 26 patients (55.3%). Table 4 also lists the nonhematologic toxicities that occurred in >20% of patients;
these were mainly grade 1 or 2 in severity. Considering the
total number of infections, we observed 17 related grade 1
or 2 TEAEs (including 7 episodes of herpes zoster and 4 episodes of pneumonia) and 2 grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (1 episode
of pneumonia and 1 staphylococcal infection).
Two episodes of febrile neutropenia were documented. No fatal AEs were reported. Two patients developed bladder cancer: 1 at the end of induction therapy
and the other 2 years after the end of therapy.

trials of FCR in patients with previously treated CLL27,29
and in patients with newly diagnosed disease26,28,30 have
indicated that this treatment scheme results in the longest
PFS of any regimen previously tested in these subsets of
patients. For the first time, the recently published phase 3
study by the German CLL Study Group comparing FCR
versus FC in patients with untreated CLL demonstrated
an improvement in OS, establishing a new treatment
model that can alter the natural history of CLL.30 With
respect to low-grade NHL, however, the application of
this effective immunochemotherapy regimen has been
poorly investigated, and the results generally are based on
subgroup analyses of mixed histologic series in both

treated and untreated patients,34 rendering it difficult to
make a direct comparison.
The ML18324 trial is the first study reported to date
to analyze the activity of FCR immunochemotherapy in
untreated INFL, excluding CLL and follicular lymphoma.
The schedule was designed to include 6 cycles of FC and
12 courses of rituximab (with 8 courses as a dose-dense
approach in the induction phase and 4 courses in an
extended maintenance phase). The results of our trial confirm the remarkable efficacy of FCR especially with
respect to the CR rate; similar percentages have been
described in patients with untreated CLL and have varied
from 44% (ORR, 90%)30 to 72% (ORR, 95%).28 In a
mixed population of patients with indolent NHL, Tam et
al34 reported an ORR of 83% with a CR rate of 42%. By
comparison, our results are better than those reported by
Tam et al in untreated patients with CLL/SLL (ORR,
100%; CR rate, 67%), MZL (ORR, 67%; CR rate,
67%), and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (ORR,
75%; CR rate, 0%). Our high percentages of remission
resulted in impressive rates of survival, particularly in
terms of FFS, PFS, and OS, that are superior to those
observed in patients with untreated CLL28,30 and in
patients with indolent lymphoma.34 To our knowledge,
our results are the first reported to date demonstrating the
best response rate compared with the previously tested
treatment regimens: FC and chlorambucil-epirubicin11,22; we demonstrated a consistent improvement in
outcome, and FCR conferred benefits with respect to the

quality of response (CR rate, 40.7% vs 67.4%), and particularly with regard to survival parameters (FFS, PFS,
and OS). Furthermore, we observed an improvement in
the quality of response after the maintenance phase, suggesting the role played by rituximab against residual tumor burden in this subset of patients with indolent
lymphoma and corroborating recently published findings
from the Primary Rituximab and Maintenance (PRIMA)
trial in follicular lymphoma.38,39 The dose-dense immunochemotherapy followed by a short maintenance treatment phase seems to offer the best treatment option in
this subset of patients with indolent NHL.
The administration of rituximab in combination
with FC chemotherapy was well tolerated, facilitating
compliance with the planned dose intensity. The incidence of grade 2 through 4 TEAEs increased throughout
the last 3 treatment cycles. The main toxicity, as in previously published findings, was hematologic; in particular,
related grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed in 55.3%
of patients without an increase in severe infections. In this
study, we did not observe the consistent rate of fatal infectious events that was reported in the LL02 trial,22 in which
such infections occurred mainly in patients aged >65
years who had splenic MZL; for this reason, we excluded
these 2 categories of patients from our study. A previous
phase 2 study by Brown et al40 indicated that the combination of rituximab and fludarabine in MZL, although it
had high efficacy, was associated with significant hematologic and infectious toxicity both during and after therapy. The excellent efficacy/safety ratio in our study may
be explained in part by our exclusion of older patients
from the study population. We observed 2 cases of bladder cancer, only 1 of which could be related to study therapy. It is known that, in patients with indolent NHL
patients who receive chemotherapy, the risk of a secondary malignancy (excluding myelodysplastic syndromes) is
only slightly higher than the risk of malignancy observed
in the general population, and treatment with fludarabine-containing regimens is considered a risk factor.41
Future improvements in our treatment regimen will
focus on reducing the toxicity observed in the last treatment cycles and minimizing the risk of secondary tumors
associated with the use of purine analogues.41-43 To this
end, a shorter induction phase (4 cycles of FCR) to reduce
exposure to fludarabine could be followed by a longer
maintenance phase with rituximab. This truncated induction phase may be feasible, because a PR rate of 60.9%
was observed after 3 FCR cycles (data not shown). This
approach may allow clinicians to capitalize on the elevated

3960

rates of response with FCR while reducing AEs, also making this regimen feasible in older patients.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FCR
immunochemotherapy followed by a maintenance phase
with rituximab is the best treatment option for patients
with INFL reported to date, producing higher remission
and survival rates compared with previous treatment regimens tested in this subset of patients. Furthermore, rituximab maintenance plays an important role in reducing
residual tumor burden, thereby improving the quality and
duration of response.
