BACKGROUND: Combined long-term androgen deprivation (LTAD) and radiation conveys a prostate cancer-specific
survival advantage over combined short-term androgen deprivation (STAD) and radiation. The seminal question is
whether or not the gains are worth the adverse effects of LTAD with respect to patient preferences. METHODS: Preferences for LTAD compared with STAD were elicited by direct patient interview using the probability trade-off
method. ‘‘Time trade-off utilities’’ (TTOu) for erectile dysfunction and osteoporosis were elicited using the time tradeoff method. Participants’ current prostate cancer-specific health state was assessed using the Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale-Psychometric. Participants’ current sexual function was assessed using the International Index of
Erectile Function (IIEF). RESULTS: All participants were willing to trade survival rather than undergo LTAD compared
with STAD. The mean minimally required increment in prostate cancer-specific survival (MRIS) was 8.2%. The mean
TTOu for impotence was 0.78, and the mean TTOu for osteoporosis was 0.71. The MRIS was correlated with the Sexual Desire domain score of the IIEF (Spearman rank-correlation coefficient, r ¼ 0.50; P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS:
Patients desired more prostate cancer-specific survival than what was afforded by LTAD and radiotherapy compared

KEYWORDS: prostate cancer, patient preferences, probability trade-off, androgen deprivation.

Despite the shift to earlier prostate cancer stage at diagnosis that has been observed in the prostate-specific antigen

(PSA) era,1 significant numbers of men still present with locally advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Recommended
treatment for these patients includes some combination of androgen deprivation (usually luteinizing-hormone releasing
hormone agonist [LHRHa] monotherapy) and external-beam radiotherapy.2 An important area of controversy is the optimal duration of androgen-deprivation therapy.
Long-term androgen deprivation (LTAD) for durations 28 months, improves prostate cancer-specific survival
compared with short-term androgen deprivation (STAD) or radiotherapy alone.3-6 However, compared with STAD, to
date, randomized studies of LTAD have not demonstrated an improvement in overall survival, except in a subgroup of
patients who have Gleason scores between 8 and 10.4,5 However, LTAD does result in a significant decrease in quality of
life7-9 and can produce anemia,10,11 osteoporosis,12,13 weight gain, fatigue,14 and profound lack of sexual desire and erectile function.15 Faced with this situation, some patients may be willing to accept a shorter life expectancy in exchange for a
good health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
In the study by Singer et al,16 who used the probability trade-off technique (PTO), 68% of study participants (older
men without prostate cancer) were willing to trade an improvement 10% in 5-year survival to maintain potency when
they were presented with a hypothetical situation comparing radical prostatectomy versus radiotherapy for localized

prostate cancer. Recent studies in patients with prostate
cancer have revealed the same qualitative result: Patients
with prostate cancer are willing to accept an increased risk
of death to achieve better quality of life.17
For the current study, our working hypothesis was
that those patients who attribute a high personal importance to their sexual activity, compared with patients who
attribute relatively less importance to their sexual activity,
would require a higher minimally required increment in
prostate cancer-specific survival (MRIS) from LTAD
before they would consider LTAD acceptable. The underlying rationale for this working hypothesis is that, for
these individuals, the personal importance they attribute
to maintaining sexual activity persistently outweighs the
personal importance they attribute to an increased chance
for survival. Therefore, these individuals not only initially
would reject LTAD (with its apparent better chance for
survival) and favor STAD, but they also would continue
to reject LTAD even if its apparent better chance for survival steadily (albeit hypothetically) increased.
If this hypothesis is supported, then the pragmatic
conclusions could be 1) that patients who face this decision should be assessed for the personal importance that
they attribute to maintaining sexual activity, for example,
using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF);
and 2) that the IIEF (or other predictors of patients who
require a higher MRIS) then could be used as a valuesclarification tool to screen for patients whose preference
structure precludes the recommendation of LTAD.

date of PSA nadir, and the 3 last PSA values with the dates
they were collected.
Clinical Characteristics
The inclusion criteria were previous external-beam radiotherapy for curative treatment of localized prostate cancer
within 6 months of study entry and no previous or current
androgen-deprivation therapy. Exclusion criteria included
clinical signs of disease recurrence (although biochemical
recurrence was allowed), previous radical prostatectomy,
and inability to provide informed consent.
Importance of Sexual Activity Rating
The importance of sexual activity was assessed by 1 nonvalidated question that was added to the end of the IIEF that
assessed the importance of sexual activity using a Likert
rating scale. The possible answers to this question were no
importance, very unimportant, moderately unimportant,
somewhat unimportant, somewhat important, moderately important, and very important. The question was
included to repeat the assessment that was done in the
study by Singer et al.16
International Index of Erectile Function

The erectile function of participants also was measured using the IIEF,18 which has demonstrated good performance as a discriminative tool and is able to detect the
difference between men who are healthy volunteers and
men with known erectile dysfunction.19

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility
Scale-Psychometric

Sociodemographic Characteristics
One hundred men who were followed in radiation oncology clinics in a large cancer center in Nova Scotia, Canada, were approached to participate in the study from
October 22, 2001 to January 28, 2003. Seventy-three
patients agreed to participate. The following data were
obtained by direct patient interview: age; Karnofsky performance status; education; current employment status;
marital status; number of children; number of individuals
in the home; the presence or absence of diabetes, angina,
previous myocardial infarct, claudication, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, bypass, or angioplasty; their preferred style of medical decision making; and current erectile function. The following data were collected by chart
review: date of radiation therapy initiation and completion, TNM staging tumor (T) classification category,
Gleason score, pretreatment PSA value, nadir PSA value,

Participants’ current prostate cancer-specific health
state was assessed by using the Patient-Oriented Prostate
Utility Scale-Psychometric (PORPUS-P),20 an instrument that has 10 items, each of which describes a specific
domain related to quality of life for men with prostate
cancer: fatigue/energy level, pain/disturbing body sensations, emotional well being, support from family/friends,
communication with physician, erectile function, sexual
interest/drive, urinary urgency or frequency, leaking/bladder control, and bowel symptoms. Each item uses a Likert
response scale with 4 to 6 choices per item. The PORPUS-P has demonstrated content validity, discriminative
validity, and excellent responsiveness.21,22 It also has the
advantage of being relatively brief compared with other
indices, because it consists of only 10 items. Both the IIEF
and the PORPUS-P were administered to patients in our
study as a prompt before the preference elicitation tasks to

ensure that patients considered all relevant aspects of their
current prostate cancer-specific quality of life.
Study Measures
The MRIS was measured using the PTO technique, as
proposed by Llewellyn-Thomas et al.23 All patients were
interviewed by 1 interviewer (D.R.W.). First, patients
were read a script that explained the purpose of the study;
then, they were shown an example of the PTO task on a
laminated card that described a patient aged 55 years who
had developed a pulmonary embolus after minor surgery
that required thrombolysis; he was experiencing shortness
of breath and mild chest pain, and he required oxygen.
The example further illustrated 2 columns of information,
side by side: Medication A, in the first column, had no
side effects and an 80% thrombolysis success rate; and,
Medication B, in the second column, had a 1% risk of
fatal intracerebral hemorrhage and an 80% thrombolysis
success rate. The patients were given the information and
then asked to chose which treatment they would prefer
(all patients chose Medication A). Then, the exercise was
repeated with the thrombolysis success rate for Medication B being increased by increments of 1% in separate
iterations as an illustration that, at some increased probability level, their choice potentially would switch from
Medication A to Medication B. The patients then performed the PTO task for the study.
Patients were given a laminated page with instructions at the top and with 2 columns of information below
the instructions. All information on the page was read to
the patients. The instructions asked participants to pretend that they were a man aged 65 years with locally
advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) who had to choose
between 2 treatment options. The first column, which
illustrated STAD, provided the duration of androgen deprivation (4 months) to be given with 7 weeks of radiation
therapy and informed patients that it would be accompanied by a total of 10 months of hot flashes, complete loss
of sexual drive, complete loss of sexual potency, and fatigue. It also stated that there would be a 55% probability
of recovering potency, an 87% chance of remaining alive
(worded as ‘‘87 of 100 men alive’’) at 5 years, and a 13%
chance that they would die from prostate cancer. The second column, which illustrated LTAD, was identical to
STAD except that the duration of androgen deprivation
was 2.5 years, and the duration of sexual side effects and
fatigue was 3 years; in addition, there was a 13% risk of
osteoporosis causing fractures and 5% probability of
recovering potency. The initial chance of survival with

Cancer

LTAD was the same as that with STAD (87% dead, 13%
alive). The probabilities in the scenario were based on literature that was available just after the initial reporting of
Radiation Oncology Group (RTOG) 92-02 in abstract
form but before the availability of published information
regarding the recovery of sexual function after LTAD,24
the risk of osteoporosis,13 and the first article that
reported the results of RTOG 92-02.5
We anticipated that all patients initially would
choose STAD; and, in subsequent iterations, the probability of success with LTAD was increased in 1% increments,
the probability of death simultaneously was decreased by
1%, and patients were asked to choose again. The MRIS
was calculated as the numerical difference between the
starting percentage in the scenario and the percentage at
which the participants’ choice switched from STAD to
LTAD.
Time Trade-Off Technique
We also used a separate technique to evaluate patients’
preferences, or utilities, for health outcomes relevant to
the LTAD versus STAD treatment decision. The ‘‘time
trade-off utility’’ (TTOu) for impotence and osteoporosis
associated with LTAD and radiotherapy was measured
using the time trade-off (TTO) technique. A utility is a
numerical measure of a preference for a health state and
ranges in score from zero to 1.25 The TTO, as originally
proposed by Torrance et al,26 asks the participant to compare 2 prospects: the health state of interest, which lasts
for X years, and perfect health, which lasts for a shorter period (Y years). The TTO is a comparison between X years
in a health state and Y<X years in ‘‘perfect health.’’ The
time point, Z, at which the participant is indifferent
between staying in the health state of interest and the
shorter time period in perfect health can be translated into
a TTOu for that health state by computing the fraction of
the original time period X represented by the switch
point. The TTOu for the health state being evaluated is
equal to the quantity Z/X.
In our investigation, first, patients were read a script
that explained the purpose of the study. Then, the patients
were shown an example of the TTO task on a laminated
card: The scenario described a man aged 65 years who
develops a brain tumor, but the treatment causes permanent blindness, and he is given a life expectancy of 16
years. Next, they were asked to choose between 2 scenarios
to determine whether, if they could avoid blindness but at
the price of having to give up some life, they would choose
1) living for 16 years with blindness or 2) living for 1 year

without blindness, giving up 15 years of life to avoid
blindness. After their initial choice, the second scenario
was changed so that the duration of life without blindness
was increased to 2 years, which meant giving up 14 years
of life to avoid blindness, and the patient was asked to
choose again. This was repeated in 1-year increments to
illustrate the task to the patient. The patient then performed the TTO task for the study.
Patients were given 2 TTO scenarios, 1 for impotence and 1 for osteoporosis. For both scenarios, a laminated page with instructions at the top was given to the
participants, and they were asked to pretend that they
were a man aged 65 years with LAPC. They were told
that they could expect to live for an additional 16 years
or more, to age 81 years, and that they had 2 choices.

The impotence scenario described loss of sexual drive
and erectile function along with fatigue and hot flashes.
The osteoporosis scenario described asymptomatic
osteoporosis and informed them that they had to take
pills to treat it and that they must always be careful not
to accidentally fall. In both scenarios, they were asked
to choose between impotence or osteoporosis either for
16 years or for 1 year of life without the disease state,
thus giving up 15 years of life. In each iteration, the duration of survival was increased in 1-year increments,
and patients were asked to repeat the scenario they preferred. The order of the administration of the IIEF, the
PORPUS-P, and the PTO and TTO tasks was randomized to determine whether there were any effects of that
order on the study results.

Study Procedures

the study criteria were approached to participate in the
study during their follow-up appointments. Baseline data
from all eligible patients who declined participation were

Cancer

collected to ensure that participants did not differ systematically from nonparticipants. Data were entered and
stored in a secure, electronic database.
Statistical Analyses
We calculated a sample size of 66 patients for this study to
detect a mean MRIS of 5% using a 1-sample t test with a
type I error of 0.05 and power of 90%. In our calculations, we assumed that the standard deviation of the
MRIS was 12.5%. We compared baseline continuous variables of participants and nonparticipants using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and categorical variables with the
Fisher exact test. Associations between MRIS scores, utilities, IIEF domain scores, and scores on the PORPUS-P
were measured with the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient. Multivariate analysis of predictors of the MRIS was
performed using least-squares linear regression with backward selection of variables.

RESULTS
Seventy-three patients agreed to participate in the current
study. Sixty-seven patients completed all questionnaires,
the interview, and the PTO and TTO tasks. The remaining 6 patients who agreed to participate withdrew consent,
failed to attend their interview, or did not complete the
questionnaires or the trade-off tasks.
The overall study participation rate was 67%. Table
1 lists the characteristics of participants and nonparticipants. In the variables that we examined, there were no
statistically significant differences between the 2 groups.
Additional baseline demographic data are given for participants in Table 2. Most participants were retired, had at
least a high school education, currently were married, and
had a Karnofsky performance status 90. The median
time from completion of radiotherapy to the date of interview was 2.3 years (range, 0.5-5.6 years). Assessment of
erectile function from direct questioning during the interview indicated that 63% were unable to obtain an erection
that was sufficient for penetration.
Figure 1 reports patients’ evaluations of the importance of sexual activity. Fifty-eight percent of participants
rated the importance of sexual activity from ‘‘somewhat
important’’ to ‘‘very important.’’
Probability Trade-Off
All patients reported that they would require some gain
in cancer-specific survival from LTAD before they
would consider it worthwhile compared with STAD.

1913

Accordingly, we were able to derive an MRIS value for
each respondent. The distribution of these MRIS values
appeared to be bimodal with responses clustered at either
end of the spectrum of possible answers. Responses in the
probability trade-off task extended from 0.5% (willing to
undergo LTAD if it produced a gain of only 0.5% in cancer-specific survival) to 13% (not willing to undergo
LTAD, even if it produced 100% cancer-specific survival). The lower modal value was 1.5%, and the upper
modal value was 13%, which was the maximum possible
increment in trade-off probability in the scenario. The
median MRIS was 9.5% (mean, 8.2%; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 7.1%-9.3%). It is noteworthy that 30% of
participants did not want LTAD even if they were offered
a 100% prostate cancer-specific survival. The current evidence4 suggests that LTAD offers a 3.4% cause specificsurvival gain over STAD. In our study, only 28.4% of participants would accept LTAD if the gain were 3.5%.
Greater than 71% of participants would not accept
LTAD over STAD when they were given a hypothetical
scenario.

Figure 1. This chart illustrates how patients evaluated the importance of sexual activity.

Time Trade-Off
In the TTO task, relatively few patients (7 of 67; 10.5%)
were unwilling to trade off any time at all to avoid impotence associated with LTAD and radiotherapy. For impotence associated with LTAD and radiotherapy, the
median TTOu was 0.84, the mean TTOu was 0.78 (95%
CI, 0.73-0.83), and the modal TTOu was 0.97.
Regarding osteoporosis, 6 of 67 patients (9%) were
not willing to trade off any time at all to avoid osteoporosis associated with LTAD and radiotherapy. For osteoporosis associated with LTAD and radiotherapy, the median
TTOu was 0.72, the mean TTOu was 0.71 (95% CI,
0.65-0.77), and the modal TTOu was 0.97. In an analysis
using the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient, no statistically significant correlation was observed between any of
the PTO scores and the TTO or TTOu scores for an individual participant.
Regarding the primary hypothesis of the study, the
IIEF erectile function domain score was correlated positively with the MRIS (Spearman rank-correlation coefficient [r] ¼ 0.35; P ¼ .01). The variable that had the
highest correlation to the MRIS was the IIEF sexual desire
domain score (r ¼ 0.50; P<.0001). The MRIS scores for
each tertile of the IIEF domain score and the PORPUS-P
score are provided in Table 3. After the removal of statistically nonsignificant variables through backward regression, the final multivariate linear regression model
contained the following variables: 1) the IIEF sexual desire
domain score, 2) age, and 3) previous coronary bypass
procedure. This combination resulted in the highest R2
value (0.35), a minimized Mallows Cp value (1.45), and
the lowest predicted residual sum of squares. When we
examined the standardized regression coefficients, the
IIEF sexual desire domain score had the greatest value,
because it had the greatest influence on the MRIS.

Patient Preferences for LTAD vs STAD/Wilke et al

DISCUSSION
Randomized trials indicate that there is a prostate cancerspecific survival advantage to LTAD and radiotherapy;
however, our current results study indicate that patients
want a longer prostate cancer-specific survival than what
is afforded by LTAD and radiotherapy compared with
STAD and radiotherapy. In our hypothetical scenarios,
recently treated patients with localized prostate cancer
demanded an increased prostate cancer-specific survival to
avoid the side effects of LTAD compared with STAD.
The median demanded increment in survival (MRIS) was
9.5%, indicating that 50% of patients would accept
LTAD if it provided a 9.5% better chance of prostate cancer-specific survival than STAD.
The willingness to trade survival for better HRQOL
is consistent with the findings of Singer et al,16 Helgason
et al,27 Mazur and Hickam,28 and Saigal et al.29 In the
study by Singer et al, who used the PTO and TTO techniques, 68% of patients were willing to trade an improvement 10% in 5-year survival to maintain potency, and
the median percentage survival trade-off was 10% (range,
0%-80%). The median time traded off to maintain potency was 6 months (range, 0-4 years) using the TTO
technique. In addition, 74% of participants reported that
sexual activity was a ‘‘very important or somewhat important’’ factor in their lives.
Data from the literature are sparse with regard to
quantifying the magnitude of gain from LTAD versus
STAD. The RTOG 92-02 study revealed that, for all
patients with LAPC, there was an average 3.4% absolute gain in prostate cancer-specific survival for those
who received LTAD versus STAD and radiotherapy.5
In our study, only 28.4% of participants would accept
LTAD if the gain were 3.5%, indicating that >71% of
participants would not accept LTAD over STAD given
a hypothetical scenario. In a subset analysis of the
randomized study, among patients who had high-grade
tumors (Gleason score, 8-10), the reported benefit in
prostate cancer-specific survival was 11.4% (93.4% vs
82%; P ¼ .0078). In that instance, 65.7% of participants in the study would accept LTAD over STAD.
Clearly, in this scenario, recommendations for LTAD
are in keeping with patient preferences. Additional data
have been presented from the European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) study
of 6 months of androgen deprivation and radiotherapy
versus radiotherapy and 3 years of androgen deprivation (EORTC 22961).5 That study failed to prove the
noninferiority of STAD compared with LTAD. The
Cancer

April 15, 2010

overall survival gain at 5 years, which was observed at a
median follow-up of 5.2 years, was 4.7% (85.3% with
LTAD and 80.6% with STAD). According to our
study, 31.3% of participants would accept LTAD if the
gain were 4.7%. The results from both RTOG 9202
and EORTC 22961 highlight the need for a frank discussion of the benefits and risks of LTAD compared
with STAD between the patient and the oncologist.
The limitations of the scenarios that we used include
1) within 5 to 10 years after STAD and radiotherapy for
LAPC, a high proportion of patients are back on androgen deprivation for biochemical failure; and 2) even with
STAD, a small proportion of patients can have a prolonged period of subnormal testosterone levels30-33 so
that, although they may choose STAD, they end up with
LTAD. Both of these factors also can be considered in decision making, but they are very hard to predict in individual patients. However, in designing the kinds of scenarios
that were included in our study, the complexity of the scenarios must be balanced with the cognitive strain on the
patient. A scenario that is too difficult or too complex
could make the experiment too difficult to complete, and
the participant simply may render the task easier by disregarding information in the scenario and make a decision
that does not incorporate all of the information.
Like any study based on hypothetical scenarios, the
generalizability of our study results can be questioned. If
this study were repeated in an actual patient population at
the decision-making point, then the results could be quite
different. It is possible that, if patients were actually at the
decision-making point, then they would require a benefit
of less magnitude because of the stress of the situation and
a subsequent re-evaluation of their values under a situation of duress. A real patient may be very driven at the
time by the desire to maximize survival and may cast aside
HRQOL at the perceived cost of a better chance of survival. This ‘‘scorched-earth’’ policy of survival (ie, survival
at any cost) may give the patient hope that, if he pays a
price, then fate may smile on his chaste choice and willingness to suffer and grant him a cure against the odds.
Therefore, it is incumbent on physicians to inform
patients properly regarding the magnitude of risk and
benefits, to assess their preferences, and to help them
make rational decisions that are consistent with the
patient’s values and beliefs.
We believe that, academically, it is noteworthy to
observe that there are discrepancies between patient preferences and treatment policies (among which LTAD is a
standard treatment policy for ‘‘high-risk’’ prostate cancer),

but these discrepancies will be discounted or ignored by
treating physicians unless there are pragmatic approaches
to screening for them in individual patients in an abbreviated and time-efficient manner. Our multivariate analysis
revealed that the dominant factor influencing the MRIS
was the sexual desire domain score of the IIEF. One of our
secondary hypotheses—that the erectile function domain
score of the IIEF would predict willingness to trade survival—proved only to be weakly correlated. Finding predictors that preclude a preference toward LTAD is
important to help aid oncologists assess this issue and help
guide discussion and decision making in this area. This is
a complex task for oncologists in a busy clinical environment; therefore, robust values-clarification tools are
required to direct these discussions in an expeditious manner and address the issue of STAD versus LTAD. Our
current results suggest that the IIEF could be used as a values-clarification tool to screen for patients whose preference structure precludes the recommendation of LTAD.
However, before it could be implemented for this purpose, the IIEF would have to be validated in this setting.
