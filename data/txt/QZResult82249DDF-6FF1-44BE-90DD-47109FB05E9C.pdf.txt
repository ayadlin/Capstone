ABSTRACT
Imatinib is the first-line drug for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), as
mutated KIT is closely associated with the occurrence of GIST. However, Imatinib
resistance (IMA-resistance) occurs inevitably in most GIST patients. Although the
over-expression of KIT in GIST is one of the major factors contributing to IMAresistance, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate
that p55PIK, an isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), increases KIT
expression, leading to IMA-resistance in GISTs by activating NF-κB signaling pathway.
Furthermore, down-regulation of p55PIK significantly decreases KIT expression and
re-sensitizes IMA-resistance-GIST cells to Imatinib in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly,
the expression of both p55PIK and KIT proteins is significantly increased in tumor
samples from IMA-resistance-GIST patients, suggesting that p55PIK up-regulation
may be important for IMA-resistance in the clinical setting. Altogether, our data
provide evidence that p55PIK-PI3K signaling can contribute to IMA-resistance in
GIST by increasing KIT expression. Moreover, p55PIK may be a novel potential drug
target for treating tumors that develop IMA-resistance.

almost all GIST patients during treatment. Currently, the
mechanism(s) of Imatinib resistance (IMA-resistance)
in GIST patients is still not well understood. Acquisition
of new mutations in KIT often is observed in IMAresistance-GIST patients [8, 9]; however, some reports
also have shown that patients with IMA-resistance-GISTs
do not have secondary KIT mutations [10, 11]. Several
mechanisms of IMA-resistance have been proposed
[11, 12], and it is likely that other, more complex,
mechanisms are involved.
p55PIK is a regulatory subunit of Class IA PI3K
encoded by PIK3R3. It has no enzymatic activity, but
is needed to recruit p110 subunits of PI3K to specific
cellular targets and thus regulates the catalytic activity of
PI3K [13, 14]. Recent reports have shown that p55PIK
is over-expressed in many cancers, and has important

INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most
common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract.
Gain-of-function mutations in KIT (a type III receptor
tyrosine kinase operating in cell signal transduction
in several cell types) or platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR) are found in most GISTs and these
mutations typically are due to early events in GIST
oncogenesis [1–3]. Imatinib (Glivec) is a selective smallmolecule protein kinase inhibitor that is the standard
therapy for GISTs [3–5]. Initial clinical responses to
Imatinib are observed in about 80% of patients with
metastatic GIST [1, 6, 7]. Although primary resistance
to Imatinib only occurs in a minority of GIST patients,
acquired resistance to Imatinib eventually occurs in

roles in several oncogenic processes such as cell cycle
regulation, cell growth, differentiation, metastasis, and
angiogenesis [15–20]. Imatinib is widely-used in treating
various leukemia patients, and can target Bcr-Abl, a fusion
protein with enhanced protein kinese activity that plays a
primary role in leukemia, particularly chronic myelogeous
leukemia. We previously showed that blocking p55PIKmediated signaling can improve Imatinib response in
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [19], suggesting that
p55PIK may play an important role in IMA-resistance.
In the present study, we showed that p55PIK is overexpressed in IMA-resistance-cell lines, GIST xenograft
tumors, and clinical GIST specimens. Over-expression of
p55PIK promoted IMA-resistance in Imatinib-sensitive
GIST cells and xenograft tumors. Imatinib sensitivity
was restored in IMA-resistance cells when p55PIK was
knocked down using specific siRNAs. Importantly,
p55PIK over-expression in Imatinib-sensitive GIST
cells led to NF-κB pathway activation and induction of
KIT expression. Additionally, when we used a p55PIK
specific inhibitor, TAT-N24, IMA-resistance xenograft
tumors were restored to Imatinib-sensitivity in vivo and in
vitro. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that p55PIK
plays an important role in IMA-resistance in GIST cells.
Furthermore, p55PIK may be a useful prognostic marker
for IMA-resistance in GIST and a potential therapeutic
target for IMA-resistance-GIST.

To better understand the mechanism of IMAresistance, the expression level of KIT and mutations
within the coding sequence of the KIT gene were
examined in GIST882 and GIST882IR cells. Sequencing
data confirmed that the KIT mutation, K642E, was present
in GIST882IR and parental GIST882 cells [12]. However,
no other KIT mutations were detected, suggesting that
there were no secondary KIT mutations in GIST882IR
cells (data not shown). Interestingly, Western blots
showed increased KIT protein expression in GIST882IR
cells compared to GIST882 cells (Supplementary Figure
S2A). Additionally, RT-PCR showed that KIT mRNA
was significantly up-regulated (Supplementary Figure
S2B). To determine whether the transcription of KIT was
enhanced in GIST882IR cells, a reporter plasmid (pGL-3)
expressing luciferase under the control of a confirmed
major promoter region in the KIT gene was constructed
[24]. The vector was then transfected into GIST882 and
GIST882IR cells and the luciferase activity of cell lysates
was measured. GIST882IR cells displayed significantly
increased luciferase activity compared to that in GIST882,
suggesting that KIT transcription was increased in
IMA-resistance-GIST cells (Supplementary Figure S2C).
These data also suggested that the increase in KIT protein
level in GIST882IR cells was due to increased KIT gene
expression.

RESULTS
Establishment of IMA-resistance-GIST cell line

Over-expression of p55PIK in GIST882IR cells
and increased expression of p55PIK led to the
IMA-resistance in GIST882 cells

To generate IMA-resistance-GIST cell lines, female
nude mice were inoculated with GIST882 cells (2 × 106
cells/0.1 ml saline), and 7 days after inoculation, were treated
with Imatinib (100 mg/kg) administered by oral gavage daily
for 3 weeks. Mice then were sacrificed and tumors (P1)
removed, cut into small pieces, and re-implanted in new
female nude mice. Mice bearing tumors (P1) were treated
again with Imatinib (100 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. This procedure
was repeated 6 times and tumors (P6) were removed from
mice (Supplementary Figure S1A). The cells derived from
these tumors were cultured, collected, and assessed for their
sensitivity to Imatinib in comparison to the parental GIST882
cells by inoculating both cell lines in female nude mice that
were then treated with Imatinib as described before. Parental
GIST882 cells remained sensitive to Imatinib since the
tumors in Imatinib-treated mice were smaller than tumors
in control mice treated with vehicle alone (Supplementary
Figure S1B). In contrast, cells derived from P6 tumors were
relatively IMA-resistance since the size of tumors in mice
treated with Imatinib was not significantly different than
those in control mice (Supplementary Figure S1C). Also,
cultured cells derived from P6 tumors were IMA-resistance
when compared to parental GIST882 cells, and were named
GIST882IR (Supplementary Figure S1D).

To elucidate the mechanism of IMA-resistance
in GIST cells, gene expression profiles were examined
in GIST882 and GIST882IR cells as well as primary
and recurrent tumor samples from three IMA-resistance
patients undergone two surgical operations for GIST.
These patients were treated with Imatinib after initial
surgery until they developed IMA-resistance and required
a second operation. Gene expression profiles of GIST
tissues obtained from primary and secondary surgical
resections were compared to those of GIST882IR and
GIST882 cells. 143 genes were identified that were
differentially up-regulated by greater than 2-fold in the
IMA-resistance-patient tumors and GIST882IR cells
(Figure 1A and data not shown). Of note, the KIT mRNA
expression was increased in GIST882IR cells and the three
IMA-resistance-GIST samples. Interestingly, PIK3R3,
the gene that encodes p55PIK, was among the genes
that were significantly up-regulated and thus was further
characterized. Consistent with these data, p55PIK mRNA
and protein expression were increased in GIST882IR cells
(Figure 1B, 1C).
To identify the role of p55PIK in IMA-resistance, we
over-expressed p55PIK in GIST882 cells and examined its
effects on sensitivity to Imatinib as well as KIT mRNA

with a lentivirus construct expressing p55PIK (Lentip55PIK) or lentivirus control (Lenti-con) overnight.
Cells were then collected 72 h after infection, and the
protein expression level of p55PIK was determined. We
observed that there was significantly increased p55PIK
in GIST882 cells infected with Lenti-p55PIK compared
to control cells infected with Lenti-con (Figure 1D). We
then assessed Imatinib sensitivity in these cells, and found
that GIST882 cells over-expressing p55PIK were more
IMA-resistance than cells infected with control Lenticon constructs (Figure 1E). KIT protein level and KIT
promoter activity were significantly increased in GIST882

a pathway mediated by p55PIK could potentially confer
IMA-resistance by inducing KIT expression.

p55PIK enhanced the expression of KIT by
activating NF-κB signaling in GIST882IR cells
NF-κB signaling occupies a central position within
the regulatory network that controls KIT expression
[25]. Previously, we found that p55PIK activated the
NF-κB pathway in several cancer lines [20], so we
examined whether p55PIK regulated KIT expression
in GIST via the NF-κB signaling pathway. For this
purpose, we constructed a luciferase reporter under the
control of the major NF-κB transcription element [26]

on NF-κB-mediated transcription in GIST cells. NF-κB
promoter activity was significantly increased and phos­

GIST882IR cells compared to GIST882 cells (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, over-expression of p55PIK in GIST882
cells increased both the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65

(Ser536) and NF-κB promoter activity (Figure 2B),
whereas knockdown of p55PIK in GIST882IR cells
decreased the phosphorylation of p65 (Ser536) and
NF-κB promoter activity (Figure 2C). Next, we used a
NF-κB pathway inhibitor, BAY11–7082, to examine
the role of NF-κB-mediated pathways on KIT expres­

p65 (Ser536) and the expression of KIT in GIST882
cells, indicating that NF-κB regulated the expression of
KIT (Figure 2D). Furthermore, Bay11–7082 prevented
the increase in KIT expression due to p55PIK overexpression in GIST882 cells, suggesting that regulation of
KIT expression by p55PIK likely depended on activation
of the NF-κB pathway (Figure 2D). We next examined
the effects of inhibiting NF-κB on Imatinib sensitivity
in GIST882 cells, and found the addition of Bay11–
7082 could potentiate the Imatinib inhibitory effects on
proliferation in GIST882 cells with or without the overexpression of p55PIK, indicating that the inhibition of NFκB restored the sensitivity of IMA-resistance-GIST cells
to Imatinib (Figure 2E).

signaling in another GIST cell line, GIST-T1 [21].
Similar to the results seen in GIST882 cells, overexpression of p55PIK led to phosphorylation of NF-κB
p65 (Ser536) and increased KIT expression in GIST-T1
cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). Increased p55PIK
expression also led to IMA-resistance in GIST-T1 cells
(Supplementary Figure S3B).
To further confirm the effects of p55PIK overexpression on Imatinib sensitivity and downstream
signaling in GIST, we overexpressed p55PIK in primary
cultured GIST cells GIST002, which was established
from an Imatinib sensitive GIST. Similar to the results
seen in GIST882 and GIST-T1 cells, over-expression
of p55PIK led to increased phosphorylation of NF-κB
p65 (Ser536) and increased KIT expression in GIST002
cells (Supplementary Figure S3C). Increased p55PIK
expression also led to IMA-resistance in GIST002 cells
(Supplementary Figure S3D). Collectively, all these data
suggesting that co-occurrence of p55PIK and KIT overexpression may be a feature of IMA-resistance in GIST.

Down-regulation of p55PIK or blocking NF-κB
signaling led to decreased KIT and re-sensitized
GIST882IR cells to imatinib
Next, we knocked down p55PIK expression
in GIST882IR cells by using a lentivirus construct
expressing shRNA against p55PIK (Lenti-shRNAp55PIK)
and a lentivirus expressing scrambled shRNA (Lenti-sc)
as vector control. p55PIK protein expression was sign­
ificantly less in GIST882IR cells infected with LentishRNAp55PIK than cells infected with Lenti-sc (Figure 3A).
We then assessed Imatinib sensitivity in these cells and
found that knockdown of p55PIK in GIST882IR cells resensitized them to Imatinib (Figure 3B). Moreover, KIT
protein and KIT promoter transcriptional activity were
decreased when p55PIK was knocked down in GIST882IR
cells (Figure 3C).
To further confirm down-regulation of p55PIK
led to decreased KIT and re-sensitized GIST882IR
cells to Imatinib, we knocked down p55PIK in primary
cultured GIST cells GIST005, which was established
from a secondary Imatinib-resistance GIST patient.
BrdU incorporation assay showed that down-regulation
of p55PIK re-sensitized GIST005 cells to Imatinib
(Figure 3D). Moreover, similar to the results seen in
GIST882IR cells, down-regulation of p55PIK led to
decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 (Ser536) and
decreased KIT expression in GIST005 cells (Figure 3E).
Knockdown of p55PIK expression or using NF-κB
inhibitorBay11–7082 also led to Imatinib re-sensitized
in GIST005 cells (Figure 3F). These findings suggested
that p55PIK modulated KIT expression and inhibition of
p55PIK-mediated signaling re-sensitized IMA-resistanceGIST cells to Imatinib.

Down-regulation of p55PIK re-sensitized the
IMA-resistance-GIST to imatinib in vivo
Next, we examined the effects of down-regulation
of p55PIK on re-sensitization of IMA-resistance-GIST
to Imatinib in vivo. GIST882IR cells were inoculated
in nude mice. At day 7 after inoculation, Imatinib was
administered by oral gavage daily and either lentivirus
expressing shRNA against p55PIK (Lenti-shRNAp55PIK) or
control lentivirus (Lenti-sc) (1010 tu/20 μl) was directly
injected into tumors every 3 days [23]. Tumor volumes
were measured every two days and mice then were
sacrificed after 17 days, and their tumors were collected
and weighed. The tumors that received Lenti-shRNAp55PIK
injection were smaller than control tumors that received
Lenti-sc (0.28 ± 0.07cm3 vs. 0.58 ± 0.1cm3 at day 17,
Figure 4A) and weighed significantly less than the control
tumors (0.27 ± 0.16g vs. 0.60 ± 0.19g, Figure 4B). As
lentivirus vector contained the cDNA sequence encoding
GFP and the percentage of GFP-positive cells was used
as an indicator to determine the lentivirus transfection
efficiency from intratumoral injection. Results from
Immuno-histochemical analysis showed that the
transfection efficiency in tumor samples was 94% and
92% in Lenti-sc and Lenti-shRNAp55PIK-treated tumors,
respectively (Figure 4C, 4D, upper panels). Furthermore,
the expression of p55PIK was significantly decreased in
tumors receiving Lenti-shRNAp55PIK injections (Figure 4C,
4D, lower panels). The expression of p55PIK, p65, KIT
and p65 phosphorylation (pp65(Ser536)) in the tumors
were examined by Western blotting. Results showed that
expression of p55PIK and KIT protein as well as NF-κB
p65 phosphorylation (pp65(Ser536)) were decreased in
tumors receiving Lenti-shRNAp55PIK , indicating that downregulation of p55PIK not only led to the re-sensitization of

Next, we examined whether the results obtained from
these in vitro and in vivo studies were clinically relevant
in GIST patients. We analyzed mutations of the KIT gene,
expression of p55PIK and KIT, and phosphorylation of
NF-κB p65 (Ser536) in surgically-dissected tumor samples
before and after Imatinib treatment from 8 GIST patients

Figure 5: Pharmacologic inhibition of p55PIK by TAT-N24 restored Imatinib sensitivity in IMA-resistance-GIST
tumors. GIST882IR cells were injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. At day 7 after inoculation Imatinib (100 mg/kg) was

given by intragastric administration. Additionally, mice were given TAT-N24 or TAT-N24M via tail vein as described previously20.
A. TAT-N24 increased the inhibitory effects of Imatinib on the IMA-resistance-GIST growth in vivo. Tumor volume was measured every
2 days. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. B. TAT-N24 potentiated the inhibitory effects of Imatinib on the IMA-resistance-GIST growth in vivo.
Tumors collected from mice receiving TAT-N24 or control TAT-N24M were weighed and analyzed. C. TAT-N24 inhibited the expression
of KIT and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 (pp65(Ser536)) in IMA-resistance-GIST xenografts. The expression of p55PIK, p65, KIT and
the phosphorylation of p65 (pp65(Ser536)) in tumor xenografts were determined by Western blotting.

(the initial Imatinib treatment of these patients are positive
response, detailed information about the patients are
shown in Supplementary Table S1). All patients received
Imatinib treatment after their first surgery and developed
IMA-resistance and recurrence of GIST prior to their
second surgery. Among the 8 patients, second mutations
were observed in IMA-resistance-GIST samples in two
patients (No. 3 and 5) whereas no new mutations were
found in the other IMA-resistance samples. Significantly,
over-expression of p55PIK and KIT was observed in all
IMA-resistance samples (a patient tumor sample, pre- and
post-treatment) (Figure 6A). The histochemical staining
of p55PIK and KIT proteins in tumor samples was
quantitatively determined and showed that the expression
of both p55PIK and KIT were strongly increased in
IMA-resistance tumor samples (Figure 6B). p55PIK
and KIT protein expression, and NF-κB p65 (Ser536)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylation were also strongly increased, even
in IMA-resistance tumor samples from GIST patients
with secondary mutations (No. 3 and 5, marked with #)
(Figure 6C). These data confirmed our earlier in vitro and
in vivo studies, and strongly suggest that over-expression
of p55PIK likely contributes to IMA-resistance in GIST
patients

DISCUSSION
GIST is the most common human sarcoma and has
been a primary model for targeted molecular therapy.
GIST growth critically depends on oncogenic KIT
signaling so tumors often respond initially to the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, imatinib. However, it now is clear that
GISTs in patients who initially respond to Imatinib
eventually develop IMA-resistance. It has been speculated

that IMA-resistance may develop due to multiple factors,
including drug bioavailability, treatment compliance,
other KIT–independent genetic changes, and secondary
KIT mutations [8, 9, 12, 27, 28]; however, currently the
mechanism(s) for IMA-resistance in GIST is not fully
understood. In this study, we examined the expression
of inter-related proteins and signaling pathways in an
established IMA-resistance variant from GIST882 cells
and collected primary Imatinib-sensitive and IMAresistance tumors from GIST patients to elucidate the
mechanism of IMA-resistance in GIST. Here, we present
evidence for a novel mechanism for IMA-resistance
in GIST that involves increased KIT expression that is
mediated by p55PIK-PI3K activation of NF-κB, a major
regulator of KIT expression.
It currently is believed that the most common
mechanism of acquired IMA-resistance in GIST patients
is through secondary KIT mutations that disrupt Imatinib
binding to KIT. Our results suggest that over-expression
of KIT protein also is an important mechanism for IMAresistance in GIST. Evidence supporting this notion are:
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

First, recurrent tumor samples from all 8 IMA-resistanceGIST patients showed significantly increased KIT protein
expression, even in the two patients with secondary
mutations detected in their KIT gene; Secondly, downregulation of KIT re-sensitized IMA-resistance-GISTs
to Imatinib; Thirdly, KIT up-regulation likely increased
overall KIT tyrosine kinase activity and stimulated growth
of GISTs in the presence of Imatinib. These data suggest
that the over-expression of KIT may play a major role
in IMA-resistance and decreasing KIT expression or
inhibiting the signaling pathways that regulate KIT may
lead to significant clinical benefit for GIST patients with
IMA-resistance [10, 11].
NF-κB is an ubiquitous transcription factor that
is commonly activated in human malignancies [29, 30].
Previous studies have shown that the NF-κB signaling
pathway plays a significant role in the regulation of KIT
expression [25]. We showed that over-expression of
p55PIK activated the NF-κB pathway, and led to increased
KIT gene expression whereas p55PIK knockdown or
blockade of p55PIK signaling with p55PIK inhibitor,
1375

Oncotarget

TAT-N24, had the opposite effect on KIT protein
expression. Pharmacological blockade of NF-κB by
BAY11–7082 and the resultant decrease in KIT expression
also led to Imatinib sensitivity in IMA-resistance-GIST.
Our findings strongly suggest that NF-κB and/or its
upstream p55PIK signaling pathway may be promising
new therapeutic targets for the treatment of IMAresistance-GIST patients. In this regard, NF-κB inhibitors
may be effective in the treatment of IMA-resistanceGIST patients despite potential broader effects on other
signaling pathways. It also should be pointed out that
there likely are other signaling pathways that regulate the
expression of KIT in GIST and these signaling pathways
may contribute to the formation of IMA-resistance. Thus,
it will be interesting to study the effects of targeting the
p55PIK-NF-κB pathway as well as other pathways that
regulate KIT expression as potential novel treatments for
IMA-resistance in GIST patients.
The PI3K pathway is a major contributor to
proliferation and survival in imatinib-sensitive and
imatinib-resistant GIST [12, 31]. Recent studies showed
that the combination of PI3K inhibitor and Imatinib
treatment was more effective than PI3K inhibitor or
Imatinib alone in GIST xenograft animal models [32].
The significant side effects and toxicity associated with
currently available PI3K inhibitors and those in the drug
development pipeline limit their clinical application. Thus,
inhibiting specific PI3K isoform (isoform-specific PI3K
inhibitors), including those of regulatory PI3K subunits,
becomes an attractive alternative method to disrupt
PI3K signaling. Recently, p55PIK-PI3K has emerged
as a potential therapeutic target in cancer therapy [18,
19, 33]. p55PIK is one of the Class IA PI3K regulatory
subunits, and has significant sequence homology with
PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 regulatory subunits in a prolinerich region and two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains [13].
However, it has an unique amino-terminus (N24) [15, 34]
that enables PI3K to activate specific signaling pathways
such as those involving Rb, PCNA, and NF-κB [18, 20,
35]. p55PIK protein expression is increased in several
types of tumors and p55PIK-mediated signaling pathways
play critical roles in cell cycle progression [15, 17, 19].
Furthermore, down-regulation of p55PIK by siRNA or
its specific inhibitor (TAT-N24) inhibit tumor growth and
progression by decreasing cell proliferation, inducing
differentiation, and blocking angiogenesis [19, 20]. Here,
we showed that increased p55PIK expression confers
IMA-resistance in GIST cell lines, xenografts and GIST
clinical specimens. The critical role of p55PIK in IMAresistance was established by showing that a p55PIKspecific inhibitor, TAT-N24 as well as Lenti-shRNAp55PIK
restored Imatinib sensitivity in IMA-resistance-GIST cell
lines and xenograft tumors. Our findings demonstrating
the importance of p55PIK in IMA-resistance-GIST
by its induction of KIT expression, raise the issue of
how p55PIK expression is up-regulated in GIST during
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Imatinib treatment. Future research on the mechanism of
p55PIK over-expression in IMA-resistance-GIST may
help identify new strategies to prevent the development
of IMA-resistance.
In summary, we have shown that p55PIK-PI3K
activates NF-κB to increase the expression of KIT in
IMA-resistance-GIST. Moreover, the p55PIK-NF-κBKIT axis is an important pathway that is involved in IMAresistance-GIST in clinical specimens. These findings
strongly suggest that p55PIK and NF-κB might be
effective therapeutic targets, in combination with Imatinib,
for treating IMA-resistance-GIST and other malignancies
associated with IMA-resistance. The over-expression of
p55PIK and KIT as well as NF-κB phosphorylation also
may be predictive biomarkers to detect GIST patients that
likely have IMA-resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
GIST882 cells, a kind gift of Jonathan Fletcher
(Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), derived
from a GIST patient with a homozygous missense
mutation in KIT exon 13 (K642E) [12]. GIST-T1 cells,
obtained from Biowit Technologies (Shenzhen, China),
derived from a GIST patient with an in-frame deletion
of 57 nucleotides in KIT exon 11 (V560Y579del) [21].
GIST882 and other cell lines used in this study were
cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS).
The primary culture GIST002 cells were established
from an Imatinib-sensitive GIST patient and GIST005 cells
from an Imatinib-resistant GIST patient (tumors reoccured
2 years after taking Imatinib). Fresh surgical GIST tissues
were disaggregated with scalpels and incubated overnight
at 37°C in a solution containing DNase and Collagenase B.
Then the specimens were treated and cells were cultured
as reported [22]. DNA sequencing of the successfully
isolated GIST002 cells revealed a deletion in KIT exon 11
(del559), while in GIST005 cells there were mutations in
KIT exon 11 (V559D) and KIT exon 13 (K642E).

Establishment of IMA-resistance cell line,
GIST882IR
GIST882 cells were inoculated in female nude
mice. At day 7 after inoculation, mice were treated by
oral gavage with Imatinib (100 mg/kg) daily for 3 weeks.
Then, the tumors (named P1) were removed from mice,
cut into small pieces and replanted to new female mice.
Mice bearing tumors were treated with Imatinib (100 mg/
kg) for 3 weeks. This procedure was repeated 6 times
and tumors removed from the last passage (P6) were cut
into small pieces and cultured in 6-well plates. The cells
attached to the plates were expanded and examined for

their response to Imatinib. The cells obtained were named
as GIST882IR, as these cells were significantly resistance
to Imatinib, in comparison to the parental GIST882 cells.

Union Hospital for GIST. All patients were informed and
provided written consent.

Cell viability measurements

Microarray analysis

Cell viability studies were performed using a kit
from Promega following manufacturer’s instruction. All
experimental points were measured in triplicates and were
repeated at least three times.

RNA was extracted from cultured cells and tumor
samples, the RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent
2100 Bio-analyzer. RNA samples were used as templates
to make cDNA and analyzed for gene expression with
Illumina Human HT12 v3 Expression Bead-Chips. The
intensity of signal was quantified by using an Illumina
Bead-Station 500GX Genetic Analysis Systems scanner.

Mutation analysis
For mutation analysis, genomic DNA was isolated
from tumor samples. Prior to collecting DNA, the tumor
tissues were determined to contain more than 70%
neoplastic cells by a pathologist.
The DNA region of full KIT coding sequences
and intron–exon boundaries of the KIT exons 9,
exons 11, exon 13, and exons 17, were screened for
mutations. Primer sequences were used as below:
exon 9: Forward: 5′-ggtcaccaaagtgcttattctt-3′; Reverse:
5′-gtgagtttgatgacagtatggtg-3′; exon 11 and exon 13:
Forward: 5′-tgttctctctccagagtgctctaa-3′; Reverse: 5′-ctgggc
tgttctaccccata-3′; exon 17: Forward: 5′- tgaacatcattcaagg
cgta-3′; Reverse: 5′- tgttcagcataccatgcaaa-3′.

Construction of lentiviral systems expressing
p55PIK and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
targeting p55PIK
A cDNA encoding human p55PIK (NCBI,
NM_003629.3) was cloned into the lentivirus vector
plasmid pCDF1 (System Biosciences, SBI). Lentivirus
expressing p55PIK (Lenti-p55PIK) and control lentivirus
(Lenti-con) were constructed and packaged following the
manufacturer’s instructions (System Biosciences, Wuhan).
Primers coding shRNA targeting p55PIK
(5′-ggacuugcuuuaugggaaa-3′) and scramble primers
coding a non-targeting RNA sequence were cloned
into a lentivirus vector, GV115, derived from pENTR/
U6 entry vector (Invitrogen). GV115 lentivirus vector
also contained the cDNA sequence encoding GFP under
the control of CMV promoter. Lentivirus expressing
shRNA against p55PIK (Lenti-shRNAp55PIK) and control
lentivirus (Lenti-sc) was then constructed and packaged,
virus particles were titered using 293FT cells following
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).

Establishment of tumor xenograft model in mice
All animal experiments were conducted by
following the Animal Study Guidelines of Huazhong
University of Science and Technology. Cultured cells
were resuspended in culture medium and 2 × 106 cells
(100 μl) were injected subcutaneously into athymic nude
mice. At day 7 after inoculation, Imatinib was given by
intragastric administration (100 mg/kg) as well as Lentisc or Lenti-shRNAp55PIK (1010 tu/20 μl) was injected into
tumors every 3 days [23]. As lentivirus vector contained
the cDNA encoding GFP under the control of CMV
promoter, the percentage of cells detecting GFP signals
in tumor samples was measured by immunostaining using
anti-GFP antibody and used as an indicator to show the
lentivirus transfection efficiency of intratumoral injection.
For this purpose, the number of GFP+ cells in 300 total
cells was determined and the percentage of GFP+ cells was
calculated.
In some experiments, at day 7 after inoculation
Imatinib (100 mg/kg) was given by intragastric
administration. In addition, TAT-N24 or control TATN24M fusion proteins (80 mg/kg) were injected into mice
bearing tumors via tail vein every 2 days as described [19].

Construction of NF-κB reporter plasmid
For reconstruction of the pGL3-NF-κB element
reporter system, the primers of NF-κB promoter element
(sequence: 5′-gggactttccgggactttccgggactttcc-3′) were
synthesized and cloned into the pGL-3 vector.

Chemical compounds and biologic reagents
Imatinib (Glivec), obtained from Novartis,
was dissolved in DMSO, and diluted to appropriate
concentrations. BAY11–7082, obtained from Sigma, was
dissolved in DMSO and stored at –20°C.

Tumor samples from GIST patients

RT-PCR and western blot

Primary and recurrent tumor specimens were
obtained from GIST patients receiving surgeries and
treated with Imatinib (400 mg/day) in in 3 hospitals
