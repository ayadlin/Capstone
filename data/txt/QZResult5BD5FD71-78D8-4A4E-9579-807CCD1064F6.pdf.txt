ABSTRACT
Targeted therapies are considered to be the future of cancer treatment. However,
the mechanism through which intracellular signaling pathways coordinate to modulate
oncogenesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we describe a novel crosstalk
among ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP pathways, with CD44 as an upstream regulator. High
cell density leads to activation of ERK and AKT but inactivation of YAP in cancer cells.
CD44 modulates cell proliferation and cell cycle but not apoptosis. The expression and
activity of cell cycle genes were cooperatively regulated by ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP
signaling pathways through CD44-mediated mechanisms. In addition, CD44 depletion
abrogates cancer stem cell properties of tumor initiating cells. Taken together, we
described a paradigm where CD44 functions as an upstream regulator sensing the
extracellular environment to modulate ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP pathways which
cooperatively control downstream gene expression to modulate cell contact inhibition
of proliferation, cell cycle progression and maintenance of tumor initiating cells. Our
current study provides valuable information to design targeted therapeutic strategies
in cancers.

INTRODUCTION

important roles in oncogenesis. These include the wellcharacterized extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
and AKT pathways and the newly emerging Hippo-YAP
pathway.
In ERK pathway, ERK is a downstream target
of ERK kinase (MEK) which can be activated by
Raf serine/threonine kinases[4]. The ERK signaling
pathway is often up-regulated in human tumors and is
a major determinant in the control of diverse cellular
processes such as proliferation, survival, differentiation
and motility[5]. In AKT pathway, AKT, also known

Cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in humans. Usually viewed as an evolutionary
process, cancer results from the accumulation of somatic
mutations in the progeny of a normal cell, leading to a
selective growth advantage in the mutated cells and
ultimately, uncontrolled proliferation[1, 2]. In recent
decades, research has characterized the cellular and
molecular events that enable the malignant transformation
of cells[3] and several pathways are implicated to play

as protein kinase B (PKB), is a downstream target of
phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3) which
is generated by activation of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) and dephosphorylated by phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN)[6]. Phosphorylation of AKT
promotes tumorigenesis via several oncogenic events,
including apoptosis and cell proliferation[7]. In HippoYAP pathway, YAP is a downstream target of a core
kinase cassette that consists of mammalian STE20-like
protein kinase 1/2 (MST1/2), large tumour suppressor
1/2 (LATS1/2), Salvador homologue 1 (SAV1) and MOB
kinase activator 1A/B (MOB1A/B)[8].The Hippo-YAP
pathway, an evolutionarily conserved pathway, plays
fundamental roles in the control of different tissues
during development and regeneration as well as in cancer
development[8, 9]. The Hippo-YAP pathway primarily
acts by inhibiting the nuclear function of YAP to control
downstream gene expression[10, 11]. During development
and regeneration, YAP is reported to be a critical
modulator during epidermal cell proliferation[10, 12]. In
cancers, the abnormal activation of YAP causes ectopic
cell proliferation[8] and was reported to be associated with
many cancer types[8, 9, 11, 13, 14].
Signaling by the AKT and ERK pathways can
collaborate to maintain cell viability[15]. AKT can
phosphorylate YAP and lead to the nuclear export of
YAP via its interaction with 14-3-3 which belongs to a
highly conserved acidic protein family and functions
as a adaptor and scaffolding protein to regulate many
cellular processes including apoptosis and cell-cycle
control [16, 17]. Recently, cooperation between AKT
and the Hippo-YAP signaling pathways was proposed to
control cell proliferation in response to extracellular cues
via PTEN[18], and YAP is able to induce ERK and AKT
phosphorylation[19, 20]. However, whether and how
ERK, AKT and the Hippo-YAP pathways do cooperatively
contribute to oncogenesis has not been addressed.
The cessation of proliferation due to contact
inhibition at high cell density, a fundamental property of
normal cells, is defective in cancer cells[21]. Abrogation
of contact inhibition can be achieved by activating
oncogenic pathways and/or inactivating tumor suppressive
pathways. However, what pathways and how these
pathways cooperatively contribute to the failure of contact
inhibition in cancer cells is not clear.
CD44 is a ubiquitously expressed cell-surface
proteoglycan that mediates cell-cell and cell-ECM
interactions[22]. CD44 is highly expressed in tumor
initiating cells and regarded as a cancer stem cell maker
of almost all solid cancers, such as breast cancer[23],
colon cancer[24], pancreatic cancer[25], non-small celllung carcinoma[26], head and neck cancer[27], bladder
cancer[28], ovarian cancer[29], prostate cancer[30],
cervical cancer[31], gastric cancer[32], hepatocellular
carcinoma[33], human nasopharyngeal carcinoma[34]
and melanoma[35]. Thus, it is not surprising that CD44
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has surfaced as a potential therapeutic target[36].
However, the molecular mechanism of its involvement in
these cancers is unclear. Previous studies have provided
evidence to suggest that CD44 is an important regulator in
signal transduction processes controlling cell proliferation,
survival and differentiation[37]. Indeed, studies show that
CD44 can activate AKT[7, 38-42], ERK [43, 44] and
attenuate Hippo signaling to lead to YAP activation[45].
Although these studies have raised the exciting possibility
that CD44 might be a common upstream regulator of
the AKT, ERK and Hippo-YAP pathways, each of these
findings was made by applying different treatments on
different cell types. The oncogenic function of CD44 has
yet to be fully established, since CD44 can also act as a
tumor suppressor[46] .
In this study, we define an ERK/AKT/Hippo-YAP
regulatory network with novel intersects that integrate
these key pathways in oncogenesis. This study further
supports the complexity of these signaling networks
in oncogenesis and provides valuable indications for
developing targeted therapies.

RESULTS
Signaling network crosstalk among the ERK,
AKT and Hippo pathways
ERK and AKT pathways can collaborate to maintain
cell viability[15]. However, the exact intersects between
the ERK and AKT pathways are not fully understood.
Here, we unexpectedly found that MDA-MB-435s cells
treated with the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD0325901, showed
an increase in p-AKT, whereas treatment with the AKT
inhibitor, MK-2206, did not significantly affect p-ERK1/2
levels (Figure 1A &C). Consistently, silencing ERK1/2
led to an increase in p-AKT levels (Figure 2B &D).
Furthermore, treatment with LY294002, an inhibitor of
PI3K—a well-characterized, major regulator of AKT
activation—decreased p-ERK1/2 but increased p-AKT
(Figure 1A & C). Studies have reported that YAP can
induce ERK and AKT phosphorylation[19, 20] and
that AKT can phosphorylate YAP[16]. However, it
remains unknown whether ERK can modulate this YAP
phosphorylation. Thus, we sought to test this again
using ERK1/2 inhibition. We found a decrease in p-YAP
upon treatment with PD0325901 (Figure 1A & C) and,
consistently, found that silencing ERK1/2 with siRNAs
also decreased p-YAP (Figure 1B & D). Likewise,
treatment with LY294002 caused a decrease in p-YAP
levels (Figure 1A &C), whereas treatment with the AKT
inhibitor, MK-2206, which reduced both AKT and p-AKT
levels, did not affect p-YAP (Figure 1A &C). Collectively,
these finding suggest that ERK likely modulates both AKT
and YAP activity, whereas AKT is unlikely to modulate the

435s. We found that high cell density increased p-ERK1/2
without affecting total ERK1/2 levels (Figure 2A),
indicating the activation of ERK pathway can be induced
by high cell density. p-AKT levels were also increased
but this was concomitant with decreased total AKT levels
(Figure 2B), which suggests that high cell density can
also induce the AKT pathway activation. Previous studies
have shown that activation of Hippo-YAP pathway to
phosphorylate and inactivate YAP was also linked with
contact inhibition in MCF10A cultures[14]. We found that
YAP expression decreased in high cell density conditions,
with p-YAP remaining unchanged. Quantification of

Involvement of ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP
pathways in cell contact inhibition
Cell contact inhibition is a fundamental property of
a normal cell so that it ceases proliferating upon reaching
confluence[21]. Failure in cell contact inhibition in cancer
cells is known to contribute to tumorigenesis[47]; yet, the
precise molecular mechanism is not clear. We therefore
tested the expression and activity of these signaling
molecules under high cell density conditions in MDA-MB-

the ratio between p-YAP/total YAP showed an overall
increase in p-YAP, thus indicating inactivation of YAP
in the Hippo-YAP pathway (Figure 2C). Consistently,
immunofluorescence staining showed that high cell
density leads to the nuclear-to-cytoplasm translocation
of YAP and its inactivation (Figure 2D). Taken together,
these findings suggest that the ERK,AKT and Hippo-YAP
pathways are involved in mediating contact inhibition,
and that activation of oncogenic ERK and AKT pathways
likely plays a major role in overcoming contact inhibition
in cancer cells.

target genes that are upregulated upon the suppression
of AKT signaling[49-52]—were upregulated upon CD44
silencing (Figure 4A). YAP target genes, ankyrin repeat
domain 1 (Ankrd1), connective tissue growth factor(Crgf),
cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61) and inhibin
beta-a (Inhba)[19], by contrast, were downregulated upon
CD44 silencing (Figure 4B). Taken together, these results
suggest that CD44 functions as an upstream regulator of
ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP pathways and contributes to
the failure of cell contact inhibition in cancer cells.
Neurofibromin 2 (NF2), also known as Merlin,
was reported to mediate contact inhibition through
interaction with CD44 [53, 54]. We found that CD44
depletion leads to decrease of p-NF2 and p-NF2/NF2,

CD44 modulates ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP
pathways in high cell density
CD44 is involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix
adhesion[48]. Previous findings that CD44 can activate
ERK [43, 44] and AKT [7, 38-42] and attenuate Hippo
signaling[45] collectively suggest that CD44 may function
as a common upstream regulator of these three pathways
to favor cellular avoidance of contact inhibition in cancer
cells. To address whether this is indeed the case, we
investigated the activity and expression of ERK, AKT
and Hippo-YAP in conditions of high cell density with
CD44 silencing in MDA-MB-435s and BT549. CD44
was successfully knocked-down by siRNA at both the
mRNA and protein levels (Figure 3A & Figure S1A). We
found that CD44 silencing led to a decrease in p-ERK1/2
and the proportion of p-ERK1/2 relative to total ERK1/2
protein (Figure 3B & Figure S1A-B). In addition, CD44
silencing led to a significant decrease in p-AKT and in
the proportion of p-AKT relative to total AKT (Figure 3C
& Figure S1A-B). CD44 silencing did not decrease AKT
mRNA levels (Data not shown). These results indicate
that CD44 senses the high cell density environment to
activate AKT and ERK1/2, overall, suggests that depleted
CD44 attenuates high cell density-induced activation of
oncogenic ERK and AKT signaling pathways.
CD44 silencing also resulted in a decrease in total
YAP protein, an increase in the proportion of p-YAP
relative to total YAP (Figure 3D & Figure S1A-B), and
a nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of YAP in high
cell density conditions (Figure 3E). Although high cell
density still led to YAP inactivation in these cells (Figure
2D), the consistent effects on YAP with CD44 silencing
and high cell density suggest that CD44 alleviates contact
inhibition-induced inactivation of YAP to some extent;
this occurs even though CD44 silencing could not reverse
the high cell density-induced nuclear-to-cytoplasmic
translocation of YAP.
To further confirm the upstream regulatory
roles of CD44, we investigated the well-characterized
downstream effector genes of the AKT and HippoYAP pathways in MDA-MB-435s. Consistent with our
previous findings, Fas ligand (Faslg) and superoxide
dismutase 2(Sod2)—both of which are AKT pathway

indicating the activation of the tumor suppressor function
of NF2 (Figure 3F). CD44 depletion leads to increase of
p-LATS1/2 but not p-MST1/2 (Figure 3G). These results
together indicated that attenuation of high cell densityinduced activation of ERK and AKT together with YAP
inactivation by CD44 depletion might involved NF2 and
LATS1/2 not MST1/2.

Indeed, following CD44 knockdown in MDA-MB-435s,
we found that cancer cells tended to accumulate in the
S- and G2/M-phases of the cell cycle and decreased the
proportion of cells in the G1-phase (Figure 5C), alluding
to a role for CD44 in cell cycle control. In particular,
we found that the expression of key cell cycle genes,
Cyclin E2 and Cyclin D1, were increased, whereas Cdk1
decreased at the mRNA level following CD44 inhibition
(Figure 5D). Inhibition of PI3K and AKT also decreased
CDK1 and p-CDK1, whereas ERK inhibition had little
effect on the expression and of the phosphorylated
protein (Figure 5E) but increased total CDK1 levels
(Figure 5F). Our data support that proliferation and cell
cycle progression are stimulated by CD44 and modulated
through the cooperative activities of the downstream
signaling networks.

Silencing CD44 inhibits proliferation and cell
cycle progression
CD44 is a transmembrane receptor associated with
aggressive tumor growth, proliferation, and metastasis[55].
Although conflicting data implicate CD44 in both tumor
suppression and tumor promotion[36], we found that
silencing CD44 decreased the proliferation of cancer cells
(Figure 5A & Figure S2). Consistently, the expression
of proliferating marker genes, Pcna and Ki67, which are
positively correlated with cell proliferation, was decreased
upon CD44 silencing (Figure 5B). This may indicate that
CD44 can promote cancer cell proliferation.
On the other hand, disruption of CD44 function was
reported to induce apoptosis [56]. However, we found that
CD44 silencing had little effect on apoptosis in cultured
MDA-MB-435s cells with sufficient nutrition (Figure
S3). Thus, we hypothesized that CD44 may contribute to
cell cycle regulation to promote cancer cell proliferation.

CD44 depletion abrogates cancer stem cell
properties of tumor initiating cells
Although no marker can be used universally to
identify cancer stem cells, CD44 and CD24 are used
extensively as potential surface markers with which to
identify and isolate tumor initiating cells (cancer stem
cells) in different cancers[57]. We found that more than
99% of MDA-MB-435s were gated as CD44+ or CD44+/
CD24Low (Figure S4 and Figure 6A), indicating that MDAMB-435s cells are enriched of tumor initiating cells.
Sphere-forming assays are widely used to identify stem
cells and to evaluate the self-renewal and differentiation
of tumor initiating cells[58]. In our sphere-forming assays,
we show that CD44 silencing decreases the number and
the size of tumorspheres (Figure 6B-C& Figure S5).
Consistently, colony forming assay shows that the number
of colonies was deceased upon CD44 silencing (Figure
6D &E). Tumor initiating cells are characterized by
their ability to yield new tumors when xenografted into
immunodeficient mice[59]. We found that silencing CD44
significantly reduced the tumourigenic potential of MDAMB-435s in mouse model (Figure 6F &G).
Finally, KLF4, Nanog, OCT4, and Sox2 are known
to be key regulators in maintaining the stemness of stem
cells[60-62]. In MDA-MB-435s, we found that silencing
CD44 caused a decrease in KLF4 expression (Figure
6H-I), which is required for the maintenance of the stem
cell-like features of tumor initiating cells[63-65]. CD44
depletion leads to decrease of the expression of Cdkn1a
(coding p21) (Figure 6H), a downstream target gene of
KLF4 [66].
Thus, our findings may help to provide insight
into the molecular mechanism of maintenance of tumor
initiating cells.

DISCUSSION

to promote tumorigenesis is still unclear.
In current study, we describe here a novel crosstalk mechanism amongst ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP
pathways, which employs CD44 as a common upstream
regulator to modulate signaling. AKT can inhibit ERK
signaling and cause a shift in cancer cellular responses
from cell cycle arrest to proliferation[69]. A recent study
shows that PI3K inhibition—not AKT inhibition—causes
the rapid inhibition of wild-type RAS and ERK pathway
signaling[70]. Furthermore, it has been found that AKT reactivation is MAPK-ERK2-dependent[71]. Unexpectedly,
AKT was activated upon inhibition of PI3K or ERK,
whereas ERK was inactivated upon the inhibtion of PI3K
rather than AKT (Figure 1). PI3K inhibition was found

Over the past decades, there have been enormous
efforts to study the molecular mechanisms controlling
oncogenesis in order to identify targets to facilitate the
development of directed therapies, an effort that is still
regarded as the future of cancer treatment[67]. These
efforts have led to the identification of many signaling
pathways that play important roles in oncogenesis.
ERK[5], AKT[5, 68] and the Hippo-YAP[8] pathways
have all been found to play important roles in cancer
development. However, how these pathways intersect and
cooperate to contribute to oncogenesis and what common
upstream regulator is involved in engaging this crosstalk

to down-regulates both the AKT and ERK pathways
and AKT inhibition failed to block ERK pathway[72].
Inhibition of ERK pathway was reported to markedly
enhanced phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT)[73]. Taken
together, the unexpected increase of p-AKT upon PI3K
inhibition could be synergistic effects of PI3K and ERK.
In addition, we found that ERK, AKT and the Hippo-YAP
signaling pathways intersect to regulate each other and coregulate downstream functions; this is in contrast to how
they were originally modeled as linear signaling conduits
(Figure 7).
Inhibition of the AKT pathway[74] and ERK
pathway[75] greatly suppressed the expression of
CD44. Silencing CD44 decreased p-ERK and p-AKT,
indicating a decrease in ERK and AKT activation (Figure
3).These results suggest that CD44 and its downstream
targets AKT and ERK might form the positive feedback
loop. The Hippo-YAP pathway mediates the control of
cell proliferation by contact inhibition[76]. Although
the related mechanism is not fully understood, several
upstream modules of the Hippo-YAP pathway, for
example, adherens junctions, are claimed to sense the
spatial and physical organization of cells in contact[76].
Our study implicates CD44 is one of these upstream

modules of the Hippo-YAP pathway that senses cells
in contact. The nuclear accumulation of YAP was
reported as a novel downstream effect of PI3K, largely
independent of AKT signaling[77]. Our finding that
ERK inhibition/silencing not AKT inhibition decreases
YAP phosphorylation led us to propose this new HippoYAP pathway sensing mechanism for contact inhibition
involving CD44, PI3K and ERK but not AKT.
CD44 was reported to interact with NF2 to mediate
contact inhibition[53, 54]. NF2, known as a tumor
suppressor, is inactivated via phosphorylation [78-80]. It
has been reported that that NF2 inhibits the activation of
ERK and AKT pathways [81] and functions as upstream
of Hippo-YAP pathway to activate Hippo-YAP pathway
to inactivate YAP[54]. We found that CD44 depletion
leads to decrease of p-NF2 and p-NF2/NF2, indicating
the activation the tumor suppressor function of NF2
(Figure 3). Taken together, the inactivation of ERK, AKT
and YAP upon CD44 silencing in high cell density might
involve NF2. In the typical Hippo pathway, YAP was
phosphorylated to be inactivated via Hippo core kinase
cassette consisting of MST1/2 and LATS1/2 [14, 82-84].
Recently, AKT phosphorylation of MST2 and a feedback
phosphorylation of Raf-1 by LATS1 was found to enable
Raf-1 to suppress both MST2 and ERK signaling [85]. We
found that CD44 depletion leads to increase of p-LATS1/2
but not p-MST1/2 (Figure 3). These results together
indicated that LATS1/2 not MST1/2 were involved in
attenuation of high cell density-induced activation of
ERK and AKT together with YAP inactivation by CD44
depletion.
CD44 is critical in regulating cell adhesion,
proliferation, growth, survival, motility, migration,
angiogenesis, and differentiation[86]. We found that
silencing CD44 inhibited cancer cell proliferation (Figure
5 & Figure S2). In addition, we found that CD44 was
involved in cell cycle regulation and CD44 silencing
increased the expression of Cyclin D1 and -E2 while
decreasing the expression of Cdk1 (Figure 5). Inactivation
of AKT signaling inhibits proliferation and mediates G2/M
phase arrest by downregulating Cdk1 expression[87, 88].
Consistently, we found that inhibition of PI3K or AKT
led to a decrease in CDK1 and p-CDK1 (Figure 5). Chiu
and colleagues showed that ERK activation increased cell
proliferation and caused an upregulation of CDK1[89].
Interestingly, we found that inhibiting ERK activity using
the inhibitor did not significantly change CDK and p-CDK,
whereas silencing ERK led to a strong upregulation
of CDK1 but not of p-CDK1 (Figure 5). YAP can be
phosphorylated by CDK1 to promote mitotic defects, cell
motility and neoplastic transformation[90]. These results
together indicate that signaling pathways using CD44 as
an upstream regulator function cooperatively to control
downstream gene expression for cancer cell proliferation
and cell cycle progression.

properties of tumor initiating cells from decreased the
number and size of tumorspheres and the number of
colonies to tumourigenic potential (Figure 6). KLF4
is a key regulator of stemness [60-62] and stem celllike features[63-65]. CD44 depletion decreased the
expression of KLF4, Cdkn1a (coding p21) and Cyclin
D1 (Figure 5-6). It was reported that Klf4-deficient
mice express lower levels of p21, indicating that KLF4
positively regulates p21 gene expression [66]. P21 was
found to suppress the expression of Cyclin D1 [91].
Taken these observations together, CD44-singaling
networks-KLF4-p21-Cyclin D1 could explain, at least
in part, the molecular events behind the involvement of
CD44 in maintenance of tumor initiating cells. ERK1/2
signaling has been linked to regulating cell proliferation
and cancer stem cell properties[92], and activation of the
AKT pathway is deemed critical for the maintenance of
EMT-associated cancer stem cell-like characterstics[74].
The Hippo-YAP pathway plays a critical role in stem
cell[93] and cancer stem cells[94, 95]. Taken together,
the paradigm described in current study is also valuable
for understanding the molecular basis of maintenance of
tumor initiating cells. We thus propose a signaling network
with novel intersects (Figure 7), where CD44 senses of
the degree of confluence to modulate a signaling network
consisting of ERK, AKT and Hippo-YAP pathways,
whereby it promotes the phosphorylation of AKT and
ERK but inhibits the phosphorylation of YAP to activate
oncogenic YAP activity. In conclusion, we described a
paradigm in which through CD44, the signaling network
consisting of AKT, ERK and Hippo-YAP pathways
controls the expression of downstream genes that mediate
contact inhibition, proliferation, cell cycle progression
and maintenance of tumor initiating cells. The paradigm
described in the current study deciphered the molecular
mechanism underpinning oncogenesis at a signaling
network perspective, and may suggest new targetable
therapies for a directed therapeutic approach to cancer
treatment.

Real-time RT-PCR

Sphere formation and plate colony formation
assay

Extraction of RNA from cell lysates was performed
using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)followed
by cDNA synthesis using PrimeScript RT reagent kit
(TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The synthesized cDNA
was analyzed by quantitative PCR using SYBR Premix
Ex Taq (TaKaRa) in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-time PCR
system (Hercules, CA). GAPDH was used as an internal
control. The real-time PCR primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.

MDA-MB-435s were transfected with either
ON-TARGET CD44 siRNA or NON-TARGET control
siRNA, separately, as previously described above. In
sphere formation assay, cells seeded into the wells of a
96-well, ultra-low attachment plate (Corning, New York,
NY).To each well, 100 cells were added inserum-free
DMEM/F12 containing 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF, PeproTech; St.Louis, MO), 20 ng/ml
epidermal growth factor (EGF, PeproTech), ITS (insulintransferrin-selenium;Sigma-Aldrich) with B27 (Gibco,
Life Technologies)and cultured for 6 days. The size of the
tumorspheres was measured and those with size over 50
µm were counted and analyzed.
In plate colony formation assay, cells were seeded
into 6-well plate (500 cells/well) with DMEM containing
10% FBS (HyClone) and 1% PS (HyClone) and cultured
for 8 days. The colonies were rinsed with PBS, fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and stained with
Giemsa stain (Leagene) for 30 min. The number of the
colonies were counted and analyzed.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was measured using the CCK-8 kit
(Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Approximately
5×103cells were seeded into the wells of 96-well plates.
After treatment with siRNA, cells were grown for 24h,
48h, 72h or 96h. To each well, 10μl CCK-8 solution was
added and the cells incubated at 37°C for 2h. Absorbance
was read at 450nm using a Bio-Rad iMark plate reader.

Cell apoptosis assay and cell cycle assay

In vivo mouse model

Cell apoptosis assay was performed using
Annexin-V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen) and
analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For the cell cycle assay,
cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed with
70% ethanol at 4°C overnight. Cells were then stained
with propidium iodide and the cell cycle distribution was
analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).

Female athymic STOCK-Foxn1nu/Nju 4-weekold mice were obtained from Model Animal Research
Center of Nanjing University. Control siRNA and CD44
siRNA transfected MDA-MB-435s cells (2×106cells)
were subcutaneously injected into the left and right
armpit of mice respectively. After 2 weeks of tumor
growth, the tumor size was measured using a caliper and
tumor volume was calculated by the following formula:
Volume=0.5×Length×Wideth2. All of the experiments
were conducted in accordance with the instructional
standard guideline of Southeast University for animal
experiments.

Flowcytometric analysis
PE mouse anti-human CD24, APC mouse antihuman CD44,PE mouse IgG2a κ Isotypecontrol and APC
mouse IgG2b κ Isotype Control were purchased from BD
Pharmingen (San Diego, CA),.Cells were resuspended at
1×106cells per 100 μl of sorting buffer (1×PBS containing
0.5% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with preconjugated CD44-APC and CD24-PE primary antibodies
for 10 min at 4°C. Three control groups were established
for the first sorting: (1) cells labeled with the isotype
antibodies of the above two antibodies, (2) cells labeled
with the anti-CD44-APC antibody and the isotype control
antibody for CD24, and (3) cells labeled with the antiCD24-PE antibody and the isotype control antibody for
CD44. The cells were washed in 1×PBS and centrifuged
at 800g for 2 min. For flow cytometric analysis, cells were
resuspended in sorting buffer after incubation with the
primary antibodies.
