Abstract
Mutations in the von Hippel–Lindau gene upregulate expression of the central angiogenic factor VEGF, which
drives abnormal angiogenesis in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). However, the overexpression of VEGF in
these tumors was not found to correlate with overall survival. Here, we show that the proangiogenic, proinﬂammatory cytokine CXCL7 is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in this setting. CXCL7
antibodies strongly reduced the growth of ccRCC tumors in nude mice. Conversely, conditional overexpression of
CXCL7 accelerated ccRCC development. CXCL7 promoted cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro, in which
expression of CXCL7 was induced by the central proinﬂammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1b. ccRCC cells
normally secrete low amounts of CXCL7; it was more highly expressed in tumors due to high levels of IL-1b there.
We found that a pharmacological inhibitor of the CXCL7 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 (SB225002) was sufﬁcient
to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and ccRCC growth. Because CXCR1 and CXCR2 are present on both
endothelial and ccRCC cells, their inhibition affected both the tumor vasculature and the proliferation of tumor
cells. Our results highlight the CXCL7/CXCR1/CXCR2 axis as a pertinent target for the treatment of ccRCC. Cancer

Introduction
Mutations in the von Hippel–Lindau gene cause overexpression of VEGF, resulting in clear cell renal cell carcinomas
(ccRCC) to be one of the most vascularized tumors. Theoretically, ccRCC should be highly responsive to anti-VEGF therapy. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, in association with IFN-a, has obtained approval
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment (1).
Despite the increased time to progression, the pivotal AVOREN
study that compared the efﬁcacy of IFN-a with IFN-a plus
bevacizumab (2) showed that bevacizumab did not improve
overall survival. However, a more detailed analysis of the
results showed that some patients were high responders to
treatment with prolonged survival, whereas the treatment was
inefﬁcient in other patients in which metastatic dissemination was observed (3, 4). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis

showed that bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy
induced fatal adverse events (5). Our recent study also
highlighted unexpected ccRCC-enhanced growth in mice treated with bevacizumab (6). We and others have also demonstrated a very important role for CXCL cytokines in the
development of ccRCC progression, in particular CXCL8 (7).
This suggested that ccRCC expresses a high amount of VEGF
and others proangiogenic cytokines that play a key role when
the VEGF/VEGFR axis is inhibited by either antibodies targeting VEGF or inhibitors targeting their tyrosine kinase
receptors.
Cytokines of the CXCL family have angiogenic or antiangiogenic potency depending on the presence or absence of the
amino acid triplet ELR in their protein sequence; ELRþCXCL
(1–3, 5–8) have proangiogenic properties whereas ELRCXCL
(4, 9, 10) have antiangiogenic properties (8, 9). ELRþCXCL
mediate their effect through their G-protein–coupled receptors CXCR-1 and CXCR-2, which leads to activation of the
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (8). The proinﬂammatory chemokine, CXCL8 also called interleukin (IL)-8, promotes angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and metastasis, and it is overexpressed
in many tumors, including ccRCC (10). Moreover, Ras-dependent secretion of CXCL8 enhanced tumor progression by
promoting neovascularization (11). The CXCR2/CXCL8 axis
was also described as a survival pathway for prostate (12),
ovarian (13), brain (14), and skin cancers (15). Moreover,
CXCR1 blockade inhibited the growth of human breast cancer
stem cells (16). CXCL8 is not the only ELRþCXCL cytokine
implicated in cancer progression as CXCL1 was shown to be
important for the proliferation of esophageal (17) and

melanoma cancer cells (18). CXCL7 is also implicated in the
development of the lymphatic network through the regulation
of VEGF-C and VEGF-D, two major growth factors for lymphatic endothelial cells (19). The role of CXCL cytokines is not
restricted to solid tumors because CXCL4 and CXCL7 are
markers of advanced disease for myelodysplasic syndromes
(20). Hence, the ELRþCXCL/CXCR1/CXCR2 axis is a key component implicated in tumor development. However, the meaning of coexpression in the same cell of CXCR and CXCL is
controversial because this autocrine pathway can drive both
senescence (21) and tumor development (16). This discrepancy
can be explained by differential expression during tumor
progression. CXCR expression may be beneﬁcial during tumorigenesis because it drives senescence. However, its expression
during the late stages accelerates tumor growth because
stimulation of CXCR induces activation of ERKs, a major
signaling pathway implicated in cell proliferation (22). The
goal of our study was to identify within the family of CXCL
cytokines the one that is the most pertinent as a prognostic
marker for survival of patients with ccRCC and to determine if
targeting this cytokine or its receptors inhibits growth of an
experimental model of RCC.

Materials and Methods
Human kidney samples
The clinical characteristics of the patients and angiogenic
proﬁle of the normal and tumor tissues were described previously (6).
Cell lines and molecular biology
786-O (CRL 1932), Caki-2 (HTB-47), and ACHN (CRL 1611)
cells were from American Type Culture Collection. RCC10 were
a kind gift from W.H. Kaelin (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, MA). 786-OLUCþ, RCC-10LUCþ, and ACHNLUCþ cells
were obtained by lentiviral transduction (pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO;
Invitrogen) and blasticidin selection (10 mg/mL; ref. 6). Tumor
1 was a nonmetastatic pT3b, Fuhrman grade 2 tumor, tumor 2
was a nonmetastatic pT3a, Fuhrman grade 4 tumor, and tumor
3 was a metastatic pT3a, Fuhrman grade 4 tumor. Tumor
fragments following surgery were treated with collagenase
overnight at 37 C and/or mechanically disaggregated with
scalpels. Tumor cells were suspended in cell culture medium
speciﬁc for renal cells (PromoCell). Further experiments were
performed after passage ten when the cell line was established.
Reverse transcription reactions were performed as described
(23). PCR analysis of CXCR2 expression was performed with the
following oligonucleotides: forward primer 50 -ATGGAAGATTTTAACATGGAG-30 ; reverse primer 50 -GAGAGTAGTGGAAGTGTGCC-30 .
Antibodies
The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting or
immunohistochemistry respectively: antiphospho ERK1/2
antibody (pERK; Sigma), antiphospho AKT (pAKT), anti-AKT,
anti-ERKs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PARP (Cell Signaling), and anti-CAIX (Bayer Health Care). The CD31 antibodies
were a rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD31 (clone MEC 13.3,

874

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

1:1000, BD Pharmingen) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse
CD31 (ab124432; Abcam).
Drugs
The anti-human CXCL7 antibodies (Peprotech) were diluted
in PBS and injected intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg), as described
previously (11). PBS was injected into the control group.
SB225002 was synthesized by Dr. Rachid Benhida, the Chemistry Department of the University of Nice, Nice, France, as
previously described (24).
Tumor xenograft formation and size evaluation
786-OLUCþ, RCC-10LUCþ, or ACHNLUCþ cells (3  106 to
10  106) were injected subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of
5-week-old nude (nu/nu) female mice (Janvier). Bioluminescence was quantiﬁed using the In Vivo Imaging System (Perkin
Elmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tumor
volume [(v ¼ L  l2  0.52 (25)] was determined in parallel
using a caliper. There was a linear relationship between values
for bioluminescence and the tumor volume.
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
experiments
Tumor sections were handled as described previously (26)
for immunoﬂuorescence experiments. Sections were incubated with rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD31 (clone MEC 13.3; BD
Pharmingen). For immunohistochemisry, a rabbit polyclonal
anti-mouse CD31 (ab124432; Abcam) was used. Vessel density
was evaluated using the ImageJ program. Three double-blind
counts were performed.
Measurement of hemoglobin and cytokines
Frozen tumor tissues were lysed in cell extraction buffer
(Biosource). The intratumor hemoglobin content was measured using a Drabkin reagent kit 525 (Sigma). CXCL cytokines,
ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF), human and mouse VEGF were
measured using PeproTech ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations (PeproTech). VEGF-C was measured using the Human DuoSet ELISA kits, and VEGF-D using
the Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were two-sided and were performed
using R-2.12.2 for Windows. Statistical comparisons were
performed using the c2 test or the Fisher exact test for
qualitative data, the Student t test or Wilcoxon test for quantitative data, and the log-rank test for censored data.

Results
CXCL7 is an independent prognostic factor for overall
survival of patients with ccRCC
Previously, we used immunoassay to determine cytokines
that regulate the angiogenic balance in 51 ccRCC patient
samples and their normal tissue counterpart (6). To investigate
whether these cytokines were associated with patient outcome, we measured the correlation between the overall patient
survival and the intratumoral levels of the different cytokines.

regression model on overall survival (Supplementary Table S2).
CXCL7 expression was identiﬁed as an independent prognostic
parameter for overall survival (P ¼ 0.014). Similar results were
obtained for metastasis at diagnosis and the Fuhrman grade
with respect to overall survival (P ¼ 0.0005 and 0.007; Supplementary Table S2).

In total, 22 patients (43%) died during the follow-up period. It is
noteworthy that patients who exhibited CXCL7 levels superior
to the ﬁrst quartile (1,152 pg/mg) had a signiﬁcantly higher
death rate (Fig. 1A). Univariate analysis showed that CXCL7
expression was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival
(P ¼ 0.0015; Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, metastasis
at diagnosis and the Fuhrman grade, which are both known to
be poor prognostic factors for patient's outcome, also correlated signiﬁcantly with overall survival (P  103 and 0.001).
Unexpectedly, the levels of the proangiogenic forms of VEGF
[levels of total VEGF (V) minus the levels of the antiangiogenic
form of VEGF (Vb; ref. 27)] did not signiﬁcantly correlated with
survival (P ¼ 0.26 and 0.49; Supplementary Table S1). These
prognostic factors (level of CXCL7, metastasis at diagnosis, and
the Fuhrman grade) were then analyzed in a multivariate Cox

Hippel–Lindau protein, which lead to constitutive expression
of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 a or 2 a (HIF-1a or 2a; ref. 28).
These cell lines only produced levels of CXCL7, which are at the
lower limit of the detection threshold. However, human CXCL7
(ELISA tests speciﬁc of human CXCL7 were used) was present
in tumors generated from 786-O cells in nude mice in a range
comparable with what was detected in human samples (mean,
2,000 pg/mg protein; ref. 6), suggesting that "factors" produced
in the tumor's microenvironment stimulate the production of
CXCL7 by tumor cells. This result was in agreement with the
data of Pillai and colleagues, who described that stromalderived "activities" were required for optimal expression of
CXCL7 by monocytes (29). These results provided the rationale
for testing the impact of blocking human CXCL7 on the
development of ccRCC xenografted tumors. Thus, 786-OLUCþ
cells were monitored by luminescence to evaluate the growth
of tumors in vivo following treatment. Mice developed tumors
seven days after cell injections and tumors remained latent for
40 days before developing exponentially. In contrast, when
anti-CXCL7 antibodies were administered 40 days after the
injection of 786-O cells, tumors remained latent for as long as
70 days (Fig. 1C and D). The effect of anti-CXCL7 antibodies
was also tested on ccRCC generated with two others independent ccRCC cell lines (RCC-10 and ACHN) with equivalent
results (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Anti-CXCL7 antibodies do not alter the angiogenic
proﬁle of ccRCC tumors in nude mice but modify their
growth
CXCL7 stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis via activation of two G-protein–coupled receptors,
CXCR1 and CXCR2 (8). However, as tumor cells may express
abnormal levels of CXCR1 and CXCR2, we hypothesized that
anti-CXCL7 antibodies may have antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties. First, we evaluated the production of
angiogenic cytokines in tumors of placebo or anti-CXCL7–
treated mice. As expected, anti-CXCL7 antibodies decreased
CXCL7 levels within the tumors. However, they did not affect
the production of other major angiogenic cytokines, including
VEGF and CXCL8 (Fig. 2A). Tumor vascularization, assessed by
measuring intratumor hemoglobin levels, was not affected by
the anti-CXCL7 treatment (Fig. 2B). To gain a more precise
evaluation of vascularization, we also analyzed the network of
blood and lymphatic vessels. Again, no clear differences were
noted for the anti-CXCL7 treatment on the number of CD31labeled cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) and no positive cells for
Lyve-1 were observed in the center of tumors in contrast to
what we previously observed following treatment with bevacizumab (6). Hence, we hypothesized that the anti-CXCL7
treatment might affect the proliferation of tumor cells. To test
this hypothesis, we ﬁrst evaluated two major signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation, the mitogen-activated
protein kinase/ERK and PI3K pathways. ERK and AKT activities were signiﬁcantly downregulated in mice treated with
anti-CXCL7 antibodies (Fig. 2C). The tumors also showed a
decreased number of Ki67-labeled cells (Fig. 2D) and an
increased number of necrotic zones (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S3). No major signs of apoptosis (assessed by PARP

876

cleavage) were detected in tumor samples. Carbonic anhydrase
9 (CAIX) is a major target of the HIF and has been extensively
studied as a marker of hypoxia (30). A signiﬁcant decrease in
CAIX protein levels was observed in tumors of anti-CXCL7–
treated mice (Fig. 2F), suggesting that the anti-CXCL7 treatment decreases cell proliferation and therefore limits the
development of hypoxic zones that have been correlated with
the selection of more aggressive cells (31).
Overexpression of CXCL7 accelerates the growth of
ccRCC xenograft tumors in nude mice
To deﬁnitively demonstrate the protumor growth effect of
CXCL7, we generated 786-O cells overexpressing CXCL7. Control 786-O cells produced levels of CXCL7 at the limit of the
detection threshold of ELISA tests (50 pg/mL/24 hours/106
cells; Fig. 3A). The level of CXCL7 in the media of 786-O cells
transduced with a CXCL7-expressing lentivirus was superior to
1 ng/mL/24 hours/106 cells. Overexpression resulted in accelerated cell proliferation, reinforcing the concept of an autocrine proliferation loop driven by CXCL7 (Fig. 3B and C).
Overexpression of CXCL7 resulted in accelerated tumor
growth in xenografts onto the ﬂanks of nude mice (Fig. 3D).
Because tumors obtained with CXCL7 overexpressing cells
were too big, mice were sacriﬁced for ethical purposes. Therefore, extensive comparison of control and "CXCL7" tumors by
immunohistochemistry was impossible because of the small
size of control tumors. Only ELISA tests and Western blotting
were possible. High levels of CXCL7 were detected in the
plasma and the tumors (Fig. 3E). No modiﬁcations of other
potent angiogenic factors—VEGF and CXCL8—were detected.
The presence of equal hemoglobin content also suggests that
the difference in tumor growth was not dependent on angiogenesis (Fig. 3F). Increased proliferating capabilities were
noted by testing ERK and AKT activity (signiﬁcant increase
for ERK and a tendency to increase AKT activity), which almost
mirrored the results obtained by blocking CXCL7, strongly
suggesting that CXCL7 accelerates tumor cell proliferation in
vivo (Fig. 3G).
Regulation of expression of CXCL7 by tumor cells in vitro
and in vivo
We analyzed the discrepancy between CXCL7 production in
cell lines and in tumor xenografts. CXCL7 is produced as a
precursor protein platelet basic protein (PBP), which is then
cleaved to give the connective tissue-activating peptide III
(CTAP-III) and the b-thromboglobulin-antigen (bTG-Ag).
bTG-Ag maturates to generate active neutrophil-activated
peptide 2 (NAP-2)/CXCL7 (32). PBP expression could be stimulated by IL-1b in colon carcinoma cell lines (32). IL-1b induces
PBP/CXCL7 mRNA expression in 786-O cells (Fig. 4A). ELISA
tests speciﬁc for the mature CXCL7 form show that IL-1b also
stimulates the production of the mature protein (Fig. 4B). The
discrepant results between in vitro and in vivo experiments
were explained by the fact that tumors generated in nude mice
produced IL-1b (mean, 550 pg/mL/mg; protein range, 50–
2,000; n ¼ 15). Equivalent amounts of IL-1b were detected in
the samples of the cohort of patients (mean, 500 pg/mL/mg
protein). In both experimental and human tumors, CXCL7

levels correlate with IL-1b levels. Moreover, cathepsin G and
matrix metalloproteases (MMP), the proteases described as
PBP-maturating proteins (32, 33), are active in 786-O cells and
probably participate in PBP maturation. Anti-CXCL7 antibodies alone inhibit cell proliferation in the absence of IL-1b,
suggesting that even if CXCL7 is produced at low level it
participates in an autocrine proliferation loop in 786-O cells.
Even in conditions of exponential proliferation in the presence
of serum, IL-1b stimulates 786-O cell proliferation (Fig. 4C).
Whereas control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) had no effect,
CXCL7-directed shRNA inhibits cell proliferation of 786-O cells
stimulated or not with IL-1b. These experiments demonstrate
by a different approach the involvement of CXCL7 produced by
the 786-O cells in an autocrine proliferation loop (Fig. 4D).
Aberrant expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 by ccRCC cells
The experiments described above suggested that CXCL7
exerts an autocrine proliferation loop via its receptors CXCR1
and CXCR2 (8). To verify our hypothesis, we determined by
quantitative real-time PCR the expression of CXCR1 and
CXCR2 in different ccRCC cell lines. CXCR1 and CXCR2 were
expressed in cell lines and in cells derived from independent
fresh human ccRCC tumor samples in comparison with human
microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) as a positive control
(34; Fig. 5A). The functionality and the role of CXCR1 and
CXCR2 expressed by ccRCC cells on proliferation was deter-

mined through the use of SB225002, a competitive inhibitor of
CXCR1 and CXCR2, which has been described in the context of
inﬂammatory pathologies and tumor development (16, 35).
SB225002 reduced 786-O cells accumulation in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). SB225002 also signiﬁcantly
inhibited accumulation of ccRCC cells derived from fresh
human ccRCC tumors (Fig. 5C) and accumulation of HMVEC
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). SB225002 inhibited ERK and AKT
activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D) and induced
PARP cleavage (Fig. 5E) in 786-O cells and HMVEC (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C), suggesting a combined inhibition of
proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, SB225002
inhibited the production of proangiogenic cytokines, including
VEGF, CXCL1, and CXCL8, in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S5). These results strongly suggest that
CXCR1/CXCR2 inhibitors could have potent antitumor growth
effects in ccRCC because they concomitantly inhibit cell
proliferation, induce apoptosis of tumor, and inhibit endothelial cells and expression of proangiogenic factors by tumor
cells.
Inhibition of CXCR1 and CXCR2 prevents ccRCC tumor
growth in nude mice
The results presented above suggest that CXCR1 and CXCR2
play a central role in ccRCC development. Hence, we predicted
that inhibition of abnormally expressed CXCRs in tumor cells

slowed down tumor growth in nude mice (Fig. 6A), suggesting
that CXCR1 and CXCR2 may represent therapeutic targets for
ccRCC. SB225002 effect inhibited ERK and AKT activity, indicating that, at least part of the SB225002 on tumor growth was
the result of decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 6B). Ki67 labeling
conﬁrmed the inhibitory effect of SB225002 on tumor cell
proliferation (Fig. 6C). An increase in the size of the necrotic
zones, which is likely due to the SB225002-dependent induction of apoptosis observed in vitro, was also detected (Fig. 6D).
We then evaluated the angiogenic proﬁle of the tumors of

periphery of tumors of SB225002-treated mice (Supplementary
Fig. S6). These results further conﬁrmed the decrease in vessel
density, which is probably correlated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of endothelial cells. Hence, our
results strongly suggest that CXCR1/CXCR2 inhibitors simultaneously decrease angiogenesis and the proliferation of
ccRCC and thus they might be considered as potent therapeutic agents for such cancers.

Discussion
Anti-inﬂammatory drugs like aspirin reduce the incidence of
cancers (36–38). This feature reﬂects the fact that inﬂammation drives different mechanisms involved in tumor growth
and dissemination, including proliferation of tumor cells,
angiogenesis, and metastasis (39). These mechanisms are, in
part, driven by secreted molecules such as ELRþCXCL cytokines, which play a key role in tumor development and
invasion. Although they were ﬁrst described to be produced

www.aacrjournals.org

by inﬂammatory cells notably neutrophils, they are also secreted by other cell types, including tumor cells of different origin
and endothelial cells (8). Their receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2
are also not restricted to neutrophils with expression in both
endothelial and tumor cells (16, 17, 21, 40).
Three questions arise from our ﬁnding: (i) Are the levels of
ELRþCXCL cytokines easily assayed on samples obtained from
patients in a minimally invasive way? (ii) If yes, can they
represent new therapeutic targets? (iii) If this latter hypothesis
is true, is it better to target speciﬁcally ELRþCXCL or their
receptors? Our study begins to answer these questions
although we have to be cautious because some of our experiments constitute a preclinical approach. Analysis of patient
samples has clearly shown that CXCL7 represents a strong
independent prognostic marker of tumor aggressiveness. The
quantiﬁcation of its intrinsic level allowed determination of a
speciﬁc threshold for pejorative outcome. This quantitative
parameter is of interest to clinicians who need reproducible
methods that can be included in clinical practice. The fact that

it is an independent prognostic marker may orientate clinicians' treatment strategies for patients with a priori good
prognosis according to clinical parameters. CXCL7 is probably
the least investigated cytokine of the ELRþCXCL family in the
context of cancer development. Only a few articles describe its
role as a marker of advanced disease in myelodysplastic
syndromes (20), in malignant pancreatic diseases (41), and in
breast cancers (42). In breast cancers, CXCL7 also promoted
tumor cell dissemination because it induced expression of
VEGF-C and VEGF-D, two mediators in the development of
lymphatic vessels (19). We and others have recently published
that targeting CXCL8, another member of the ELRþCXCL
family, inhibits the growth of 786-O xenografts (6, 7). However,
anti-CXCL7 antibodies block tumor growth whereas antiCXCL8 antibodies only slow down tumor growth highlighting
CXCL7 as a more relevant target. Moreover, CXCL8 does not
seem as a prognostic marker of survival in uni- or multivariate
analysis in the cohort of patients that we analyzed (P ¼ 0.49).
Among all the other ELRþCXCL cytokines we analyzed in our
cohort of patients, only CXCL1 seems as a marker of poor
prognosis in univariate analysis but fails to reach statistical
signiﬁcance in multivariate analysis (P ¼ 0.017 and 0.06,
respectively). Like for anti-CXCL8 antibodies, anti-CXCL1 antibodies alone only slow down tumor growth. Anti-CXCL1 (not

880

shown) or anti-CXCL8 (6) antibodies did not decrease the
intratumoral levels of CXCL7. These results probably explain
their weaker effects on tumor growth.
Discrepancies between basal production of CXCL7 by ccRCC
cells in vitro and secretion in vivo were intriguing. Although
active factors produced by stromal cells have already been
suspected to stimulate CXCL7 production (29), the role of IL-1b
suggests the contribution of cytokines produced by inﬂammatory cells in the tumor context to favor CXCL7 production
by cancer cells. Maturation toward the active NAP-2/CXCL7 is
then mediated by MMPs like in colon tumor cells or epithelial
cells from patients with colitis (32) or by cathepsin G present at
the surface of neutrophils (33). Hence, our results strongly
suggest that in addition to hematopoietic cells, epithelial cells
have the ability to produce mature cytokines, which serve as
chemoattractants for neutrophils or macrophages to maintain
the inﬂammatory context within the tumors. Moreover, IL-1b
was shown to be produced by ccRCC cells with a high malignancy potential and to participate in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (43). Our experiments suggest that IL-1b
promotes tumor cell proliferation via CXCL7 production and
enhances tumor aggressiveness.
Before the development of antiangiogenic therapies, the
prognosis of metastatic ccRCC was poor. Although they have

agents. These points are essential to reduce the health cost but
more importantly to limit the number of patients developing
adverse events (5, 6). Beyond the role as prognostic markers
CXCL cytokines could also be considered as predictive markers
of response to antiangiogenic therapies, not only in ccRCC but
also in other cancer types, as we suggested recently (6, 23). A
clinical assay aimed at correlating the plasma level of CXCL
cytokines and the response to sunitinib in metastatic ccRCC
patients is currently ongoing.
Our study questions the use of speciﬁc antibodies against
CXCL7 or of CXCR1/CXCR2 inhibitors. When taking into
consideration the development of inﬂammatory zones during
the ﬁrst phases of tumor development, we hypothesized that
targeting speciﬁcally CXCL7 could be a good choice and would
probably be a less aggressive treatment with limited side
effects. Moreover, expression of CXCR1/CXCR2 might represent a "protective barrier" for cancer development through
induction of senescence (21). However, the most aggressive
forms of ccRCC apparently use the CXCR1/CXCR2 pathway to
drive an autocrine proliferation loop. This more aggressive
tumor is characterized by an active inﬂammatory component
and angiogenesis dependent on cytokines secreted by tumor
and inﬂammatory cells. CXCL7 is involved in this autocrine
loop, but other members of the family of ELR þ CXCL
cytokines, including CXCL1 and CXCL8, which are expressed
by ccRCC, as we have previously shown (6) and whose role in
tumor development has been widely described (48–50). Then,
an inhibitor of CXCR1/CXCR2 might target at the same time
tumor, endothelial, and inﬂammatory cells thereby limiting
tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inﬂammation. However, in tumor treated by SB225002, we did not observe a
decrease of CXCL7 levels probably because SB225002 enhances
IL-1b–dependent CXCL7 expression by an as yet unknown
mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S7). In conclusion, our study
provides the framework for new therapeutic approaches tar-

geting ccRCC subsequent to the failure of the "gold standard"
antiangiogenic treatment sunitinib (51). Validation of CXCL7
as a relevant prognostic/predictive marker of response to
standard therapy in a larger, independent cohort of patients
must now be performed to extend our results.
