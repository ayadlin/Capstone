Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable clonal plasma cell malignancy. Because
of a high rate of immunoglobulin synthesis, the endoplasmic reticulum of MM cells
is subjected to elevated basal levels of stress. Consequently, proteasome inhibitors,
which exacerbate this stress by inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein
degradation, are an important new class of chemotherapeutic agents being used
to combat this disease. However, MM cells still develop resistance to proteasome
inhibitors such as carfilzomib. Toward this end, we have established carfilzomibresistant derivatives of MM cell lines. We found that resistance to carfilzomib was
associated with elevated levels of prosurvival autophagy, and Kruppel-like factor 4
(KLF4) was identified as a contributing factor. Expression levels as well as nuclear
localization of KLF4 protein were elevated in MM cells with acquired carfilzomib
resistance. Chromatin immunoprecipitations indicated that endogenous KLF4 bound
to the promoter regions of the SQSTM1 gene encoding the ubiquitin-binding adaptor
protein sequestosome/p62 that links the proteasomal and autophagic protein
degradation pathways. Ectopic expression of KLF4 induced upregulation of SQSTM1.
On the other hand, inhibitors of autophagy sensitized MM cells to carfilzomib, even
in carfilzomib-resistant derivatives having increased expression of the multidrug
resistance protein P-glycoprotein. Thus, we report here a novel function for KLF4,
one of the Yamanaka reprogramming factors, as being a contributor to autophagy
gene expression which moderates preclinical proteasome inhibitor efficacy in MM.

INTRODUCTION

of relapsed/refractory MM patients who have received
at least two prior therapies including bortezomib and
an immunomodulatory drug [9]. While encouraging,
the overall response rates to carfilzomib monotherapy
in pivotal phase II studies were <25% (17.1% in the
PX‑171‑004 study and 23.7% in the PX‑171‑003‑A1
study, respectively) [10, 11], indicating that the majority
of the MM cells that became resistant to bortezomib also
exhibited resistance to carfilzomib. Thus, it is important
to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of proteasome
inhibitor resistance in MM and identify novel agents that
will enhance therapeutic efficacy of this class of anti-MM
drugs.
MM exhibits considerable genetic heterogeneity,
with particular cytogenetic abnormalities such as

Multiple myeloma (MM), the second most
common hematologic malignancy in the United States,
is characterized by the accumulation of clonal plasma
cells in the bone marrow [1]. Although MM patients
initially respond to therapy, they inevitably relapse due
to the development of treatment resistance [2]. The
introduction of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has
improved clinical outcome of MM patients [3]. However,
MM cells acquire resistance to bortezomib by diverse
mechanisms [4-8]. Carfilzomib is a second generation
proteasome inhibitor that was approved in 2012 by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment

the t(4;14) chromosomal translocation consistently
associated with poor outcome [12]. In previous work, we
identified upregulated expression of the ABCB1-encoded
P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance efflux pump in
t(4;14)-positive KMS-34 MM cells following short-term
exposure to carfilzomib [13]. To gain further insight into
the various mechanisms of carfilzomib resistance, we
subjected another t(4;14)-positive MM cell line, KMS11, together with KMS-34 to long-term selection in
increasingly higher concentrations of the drug, deriving
carfilzomib-resistant KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells,
respectively. Of note, overexpression of ABCB1 was
not observed in KMS-11/Cfz cells. Gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) [14] of microarray gene expression
profiling data implicated increased expression of the
pluripotency reprogramming factor Kruppel-like factor 4
(KLF4) [15] as contributing to carfilzomib resistance in
both cases.
Depending on the type of cancer and genetic context,
KLF4 can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene
[16]. Notably, high levels of KLF4 expression often occur
in MM patients carrying the t(4;14) translocation [17,
18]. Moreover, it was previously reported that exogenous
expression of KLF4 partially protected some MM cell
lines from cytotoxicity induced by the alkylating agent
melphalan, and the partial protection was attributed to a
proliferation block [19]. In the current study, we found
that acquisition of carfilzomib resistance in both t(4;14)positive MM cell line models was associated with reduced
cell proliferation, decreased plasma cell maturation, and
activation of prosurvival autophagy. Specifically, we show
that KLF4 plays a role in prosurvival autophagy by binding
to the promoter regions and increasing the expression of
SQSTM1 encoding the ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein
sequestosome (SQSTM1/p62) that links the proteasomal
and selective autophagic protein degradation pathways
[20, 21]. Furthermore, resensitization of KMS-11/Cfz and
KMS-34/Cfz cells to carfilzomib could be achieved by
cotreatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine [22].

approximately 8 weeks. In the current study, KMS-11/Cfz
and KMS-34/Cfz cells were profiled for gene expression
after 1 week of growth in the absence of carfilzomib
together with parental KMS-11 and KMS-34 cells which
had not been selected in the drug.
We employed GSEA to query gene sets in the
Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) to uncover
processes or pathways shared between KMS-11/Cfz
and KMS-34/Cfz cells that potentially contributed to
carfilzomib resistance [14]. We first applied GSEA to
examine gene sets from the canonical pathways (C2:CP)
collection of MSigDB (1,330 gene sets). The most
significantly enriched set of upregulated genes in the
carfilzomib-resistant derivatives was the proteasome
pathway (Kegg: hsa03050), with PSMB5 encoding the
β5 proteasome subunit targeted by carfilzomib as the topranked gene (normalized enrichment score, NES = 2.62,
false discovery rate, FDR < 0.001; Figure S1A) [23]. The
strength of the GSEA method is its utility in identifying
modest changes in expression of groups of genes
distributed across entire networks or pathways [14]. Realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) analysis validated the microarray expression data
that PSMB5 mRNA levels were only slightly increased
(Table 1). Likewise, no marked increase was observed
in mRNA for the immunoproteasome β5i/LMP7 subunit
(encoded by PSMB8) that is also specifically targeted by
carfilzomib [23]. Based on prior findings that bortezomibresistant cell lines with 2- to 4-fold increased PSMB5
mRNA levels retained sensitivity to carfilzomib [24],
these results suggested that additional mechanisms may
contribute to carfilzomib resistance in KMS-11/Cfz and
KMS-34/Cfz cells.
It was recently demonstrated that MM cells can
acquire resistance to bortezomib via de-commitment to
plasma cell differentiation [7]. Notably, among 1,910 gene
sets in the immunologic signatures (C7) collection, three
of those that were highly scored reflected a partial reversal
of plasma cell maturation in the carfilzomib-resistant MM
derivatives. The most significantly enriched gene set in
KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells corresponded to
genes with increased expression in IgM-memory B cells
versus plasma cells (NES = 1.75, FDR = 0.005; Figure
1A). A set containing genes more highly expressed in
naive B cells than in plasma cells (NES = 1.49, FDR =
0.06; Figure 1B) and one containing genes with higher
levels of expression in Ig isotype-switched memory B
cells relative to plasma cells (NES = 1.46, FDR = 0.06;
Figure 1C) were also significantly enriched. We observed
that KLF4 was included within the leading edge subset
of upregulated genes in all three gene sets, in line with
its higher expression in naive and memory B cells than
in plasma cells [25-27]. Furthermore, using GeneSpring
analysis software, we found overrepresentation of KLF4
target genes previously characterized by genome-wide
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in embryonic stem

RESULTS
KLF4 contributes to molecular phenotype of
carfilzomib-resistant MM cells
KMS-11 and KMS-34 cells were exposed to
stepwise increasing concentrations of carfilzomib over
a period of 18 weeks: cells adapted to growth in 4 nM
carfilzomib by 4 weeks, in 6 nM in another 6 weeks and in
12 nM after a further 8 weeks, albeit proliferating slower
than parental cells not exposed to the drug. The resulting
MM cell cultures, denoted KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/
Cfz, respectively, retained resistance to carfilzomib
even when tested after removal of selective pressure for

PCR analysis (Figure 2A), which was paralleled by a
corresponding increase in KLF4 protein levels (~3.0
± 0.7-fold, n = 4, P < 0.009 by paired Student’s t test)
detected by western blotting (Figure 2B). Consistent with
its function as a transcriptional regulator and potential
role in the carfilzomib-resistant phenotype [29, 30],
immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed more
prominent nuclear localization of KLF4 in the carfilzomibresistant MM derivatives (Figure 2C).
We tested the hypothesis that KLF4 might contribute
to the molecular phenotype of carfilzomib-resistant
MM cells by short-term expression of a KLF4 cDNA in
KMS-11 cells (denoted KMS-11/KLF4). Fourteen genes
showing differential expression in KMS-11/Cfz (FC
≥ 1.4) and/or KMS-34/Cfz (FC ≥ 1.5) versus parental
MM cells were selected, and their expression levels
compared to those in KMS-11/KLF4 cells by qRT-PCR
analysis (Table 1). A substantial degree of correlation
was found between the expression changes associated
with the introduction of exogenous KLF4 and acquisition
of carfilzomib resistance in KMS-11/Cfz (r = 0.77) and
KMS-34/Cfz cells (r = 0.59) for the selected set of genes
(Table 1). Of note, several of the genes that exhibited
KLF4-induced changes in expression — CYP1A1,
NQO1, HOXB7 and ID1 — were previously identified as
direct KLF4 targets by genome-wide ChIP analysis [28].
Another of the genes, SLAMF7 encodes CD319, a cell
surface marker specifically upregulated at the plasma cell
stage during B cell differentiation [27, 31]. We verified
that SLAMF7 mRNA levels were downregulated in the
carfilzomib-resistant MM derivatives in accord with

the less differentiated plasma cell phenotype revealed
by GSEA analysis above. Moreover, SLAMF7 mRNA
levels were also reduced following ectopic expression
of KLF4 in KMS-11 cells. Together, the accumulated
data supported the notion that carfilzomib-resistant MM
cells had increased KLF4 transcriptional activity which
was associated with the partial reversal of plasma cell
maturation during acquisition of drug resistance.

GSEA identifies altered expression of KLF4 target
genes associated with autophagy and metabolic
pathways in carfilzomib-resistant MM cells
We next used GSEA to examine gene sets from
the C2:CGP chemical and genetic perturbations (3,395
gene sets) and C6 oncogenic signatures (189 gene sets)
collections of MSigDB. A highly enriched C2:CGP gene
set in KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells (NES = 2.02,
FDR < 0.007; Figure 3A) represented molecular targets
that were upregulated during inhibition of MM cell growth
following treatment with adaphostin [32]. Bortezomib
reportedly triggered similar effects, and a recent study
identifying c-Abl as a regulator of proteasome homeostasis
provides some insight into the cross-talk between the
pathways involved [33]. Interestingly, included in the
leading edge subset were several genes associated with
autophagy (highlighted in Figure 3). Among them were
MAP1LC3B encoding the autophagic effector protein
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain Cβ, and
SQSTM1 encoding the selective autophagy receptor

sequestosome 1/p62 [34, 35]. During autophagy, a soluble
form of LC3B (LC3B-I) is converted to a form (LC3BII) that specifically associates with autophagosomes
and is recognized by SQSTM1/p62 [36]. Also included
was GADD45A, a growth arrest and DNA repair gene
previously shown to be a KLF4-inducible gene in
Hodgkin lymphoma cells and a stimulator of autophagy
during skeletal muscle atrophy [37, 38]. Moreover, the
most highly enriched gene set in the C6 collection (NES =
1.70, FDR = 0.05) corresponded to genes in MCF-7 breast
cancer cells adapted for estrogen-independent growth in
culture that were upregulated in the carfilzomib-resistant
MM cells; KLF4 and GADD45A were included in the
leading edge subset (Figure 3B). A further association
with autophagy-related processes was suggested by a
recent study reporting that one of the genes in the leading
edge subset, LAMP3 encoding lysosome-associated
membrane protein 3, is involved in resistance to the antiestrogen tamoxifen in breast cancer cells by promoting
prosurvival autophagy [39]. Another gene, ISG15,
encoding an ubiquitin-like protein, was recently shown
to interact with SQSTM1/p62, augmenting association
with LC3B-II and facilitating autophagic degradation of
aggresomes, in response to various types of cellular stress
including proteasome inhibition [40]. Considered together,
the genes represented in the leading edge subsets of the
gene sets presented in Figure 3A, 3B suggested potential
upregulation of autophagy pathways in the carfilzomib-

resistant MM derivatives.
Conversely, among the downregulated sets of
genes that were enriched in KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/
Cfz cells, one of the most highly scored in the C2:CGP
collection corresponded to genes belonging to an IRF4
regulatory network that are expressed at higher levels
during B cell differentiation (NES = -1.98, FDR =
0.01; Figure 3C) [41]. SLAMF7 was included in the
leading edge subset of downregulated genes. We noted
that many of the other downregulated genes in the
leading edge subset are involved in lipid metabolism
(e.g., INSIG1, HMGCR, SCD, PAM, LDLR, SQLE,
CYP51A1, MVK), and complementary analysis of the
C2:CP canonical pathways collection (1,330 gene sets)
by GSEA indicated downregulation of genes involved in
cholesterol biosynthesis (Reactome: REACT_9405.3) in
the carfilzomib-resistant MM cells as being statistically
significant (NES = -2.41, FDR = 0.001; Figure S1B).
Consistent with the inverse correlation observed between
KLF4 levels and expression levels of these genes, several
were previously demonstrated to be negatively regulated
by ectopic KLF4 expression [42]. Examples included
three genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis: HMGCR
encoding HMG-CoA reductase and MVK encoding
mevalonate kinase, early enzymes in the mevalonate
pathway; and CYP51A1 encoding a cytochrome P450
family member involved in the conversion of lanosterol
to cholesterol. Additionally, although no significant

enrichment of glycolysis-related gene sets was revealed
by GSEA, LDHA, which encodes a subunit of lactate
dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the glycolytic phenotype
of cancer cells (known as the Warburg effect) [43]
previously identified as a KLF4-repressed gene [44]
was downregulated in the carfilzomib-resistant MM
derivatives (Figure 3C). In view of increasing evidence
that enhanced lipid catabolism and low glycolytic activity
in slowly proliferating tumor cells is associated with
autophagy induction and treatment resistance [45], the
above observations raised the possibility that activation
of prosurvival autophagy could be a mechanism adopted
by the carfilzomib-resistant MM cells to counteract the
deficiency of proteasome function and metabolic stress
induced by carfilzomib treatment.

colocalization of the two factors correlated with
acquisition of carfilzomib resistance (P < 0.003; Figure
4D). To further characterize autophagic activity, we used
the fluorescent autophagosome-specific reporter construct
encoding a GFP-LC3 fusion protein [50], and examined
GFP-LC3 signals by fluorescence confocal microscopy in
KMS-11 and KMS-11/Cfz cells treated with or without
carfilzomib. An increased number of GFP-LC3-II puncta
was observed in KMS-11/Cfz cells (Figure 5A). To
determine whether this was associated with increased
autophagic flux, cells were treated with carfilzomib in
the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors and the
levels of endogenous LC3B-I and LC3B-II measured by
western blotting. As shown in Figure 5B, the degree of
LC3B-II stabilization as reflected by the relative increase
in the LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio was greater in carfilzomibresistant versus parental MM cells (P < 0.0001). Similar
results were obtained when the cells were cotreated
with chloroquine which, by increasing lysosomal pH,
inhibits autophagic protein degradation and blocks
autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Figure 5B) [51].
The above results are consistent with the view
that increased autophagic flux was occurring in the
carfilzomib-resistant MM cells. Inhibition of autophagy by
chloroquine treatment was previously reported to enhance
carfilzomib-induced cell death of head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma cell lines [52]. To test whether concomitant
inhibition of autophagy would sensitize KMS-11/Cfz and
KMS-34/Cfz to carfilzomib, the cells were treated with
carfilzomib in the presence or absence of chloroquine,
and cell growth was measured by alamarBlue assay.
Importantly, cotreatment with chloroquine diminished
carfilzomib resistance in both KMS-11/Cfz and KMS34/Cfz cell lines, indicating that prosurvival autophagy
contributes to acquired drug resistance in these MM cell
line models (Figure 5C).

with

We first examined whether autophagic activity was
increased in carfilzomib-resistant KMS-11/Cfz and KMS34/Cfz cells by flow cytometry using the fluorescent dye
Cyto-ID Green [46, 47]. Fluorescence signals reflect
steady state levels of autophagosomes as a result of two
offsetting processes: formation of autophagosomes and
dissolution of autophagosomes upon lysosomal fusion.
We found higher steady state levels of autophagosomes
in resistant cells versus their parental counterparts in both
MM cell line models (relative increase in autophagic
activity based on Cyto-ID mean fluorescence intensity
values = 16.6 ± 1.3, P < 0.05, paired Student’s t test; see
Materials and Methods for details) (Figure 4A).
Second, we investigated autophagic flux by
measuring the processing of LC3B, an ubiquitin-like
protein that is converted during autophagy to a lipidated
form (LC3B-II) associated with autophagosome
membranes [34]. To distinguish between synthesis,
modification and degradation rates of LC3B, the ratio
of the LC3B-II faster migrating form to the nonlipidated
precursor (LC3B-I) is determined in the absence or
presence of inhibitors of lysosome-mediated proteolysis
[48]. Both carfilzomib-resistant MM derivatives exhibited
higher levels of synthesis and modification of LC3B (as
measured by LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio) in comparison to
parental cells in the presence of a mixture of the lysosomal
protease inhibitors E64d, pepstatin A and leupeptin (Figure
4B). Increased levels of the ubiquitin cargo receptor and
autophagy substrate SQSTM1/p62 in KMS-11/Cfz cells in
the presence of the lysosomal protease inhibitors was also
consistent with more active autophagy (Figure 4C).
Next, since SQSTM1/p62 is recruited into
autophagosomes by lipidated LC3B-II [49], we assessed
the subcellular localization of LC3B and SQSTM1/p62
proteins by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy.
In both KMS-11 and KMS-34 cell line models increased

KLF4 regulates the autophagy receptor gene
SQSTM1
The SQSTM1/p62 protein is of particular interest
given its role as an adaptor for both proteasomal and
autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins [20,
21]. As shown in Figure 6A, we confirmed that SQSTM1
mRNA levels were higher in the carfilzomib-resistant MM
derivatives and we demonstrated that the levels increased
upon ectopic expression of KLF4 in KMS-11 cells by
qRT-PCR analysis. A review of the literature revealed that
SQSTM1 was included in a list of direct KLF4 binding
targets detected by genome-wide ChIP analysis [53].
We therefore analyzed the genomic regions upstream
of the SQSTM1 transcription start sites, and identified
evolutionally conserved KLF4-binding motifs (Figure 6B;
Figure S2). We performed qPCR-based ChIP analysis in
KMS-11 and KMS-11/Cfz cells and confirmed binding to

experiments, the KLF4 promoter region was included
as a positive control [55], whereas GATA6 genomic

regions were used as negative controls [28, 53]. These
observations support the proposal that KLF4 contributes
to carfilzomib resistance by upregulating SQSTM1

(designated PR) based on expression of certain cell
cycle and proliferation-associated genes [58]. The PR
subgroup signature was present in approximately 18%
of newly diagnosed MM and increased during disease
progression to 45% of relapsed cases; strikingly, many
of the WHSC1-defined t(4;14)-positive samples were
found to cluster in this subgroup [58]. We used the
recently published PROGgeneV2 prognostic biomarker
identification tool [59] to study the implications of
WHSC1, KLF4 and SQSTM1 gene expression on
overall survival of 47 MM patients in the PR subgroup
(GEO accession number GSE2658). Using median gene
expression values as bifurcation points, Cox proportional
hazards analyses showed that elevated expression of
these genes was associated with inferior 3-year survival
outcomes (Figure 7). Kaplan-Meier plots indicated
significant segregation in survival outcomes for patients
with high versus low WHSC1 expression (hazard ratio,
HR = 1.95; 95% confidence interval/CI, 1.16-3.28; P =
0.01), with increasingly worse prognosis when high level
coexpression of KLF4 (HR = 4.33; 95% CI, 2.04-9.18; P
= 1.0 x 10-4) (Figure 7B), and KLF4 plus SQSTM1 (HR =
8.40; 95% CI, 2.80-25.17; P = 1.0 x 10-4) (Figure 7C) were
also considered. When high levels of coexpression of the

expression in these MM cell line models.
To further investigate the potential relevance of
a KLF4-associated autophagy component in MM, we
identified KLF4 profile neighbors across 304 MM patient
samples in the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium
reference collection dataset (GEO accession number
GSE26760). In agreement with earlier work [17, 18],
the two genes dysregulated by the t(4;14) translocation,
WHSC1 and FGFR3 [56], were among the top KLF4
neighbors (1,470 out of 54,675 total on the array).
Moreover, the set was enriched for genes associated
with the annotation term “autophagy” in the NCBI Gene
database (P = 2.34 x 10-4). Importantly, the list included
SQSTM1 (Table S2). These results, demonstrating
similarity in expression pattern and shared function [57],
suggest that contribution to prosurvival autophagy is a
clinically relevant aspect of KLF4 expression as regards
MM pathobiology.

is postulated to contribute to prosurvival autophagy
by facilitating delivery of aggregated substrates to
autophagosomes via LC3B-II for subsequent destruction
[65]. The relevance of this process in the MM therapeutic
response to proteasome inhibition is supported by the
recent finding that short hairpin RNA knockdown of
SQSTM1 mRNA resulted in failure of autophagosomes
to trap ubiquitinated cargo in MM cells, converting
prosurvival autophagy to apoptosis [66].
KLF4 expression is consistently associated with
MM patients carrying the t(4;14) translocation [17, 18].
Two genes are aberrantly expressed as a consequence
of the translocation: WHSC1, encoding a histone
methyltransferase (also referred to as MMSET or NSD2),
and FGFR3 encoding a transmembrane tyrosine kinase
[56]. Gain- and loss-of function studies in MM cell lines
have demonstrated that WHSC1 histone methyltransferase
activity is involved in the epigenetic upregulation of KLF4
[67, 68]. Notably, there is highly significant overlap (P
< 1 x 10-33) between the WHSC1 target genes identified
and the differentially expressed genes in KMS-11/Cfz
(86 out of 887; FC ≥ 1.4) and KMS-34/Cfz (69 out of
888 genes, FC ≥ 1.5). Therefore, inhibition of WHSC1
enzymatic function or its ability to interact with chromatin
may represent a promising future combination therapy for
this subgroup of MM patients [67, 68].
Although the upstream pathways remain undefined,
it is worth noting that induction of KLF4 transcription
was previously observed in endothelial cells treated with
bortezomib or epoxomicin (the natural epoxyketone from
which carfilzomib was derived) [69]. Increased levels
of KLF4 have also been observed following inhibition
of translation by depletion of the translation initiation
factor eIF4GI [70]. As eIF4GI depletion was reported to
phenocopy mTOR inhibition and promote autophagy [70],
and inhibition of mTOR activity by rapamycin induced
KLF4 expression in other cells [71], mechanisms linking
protein turnover and protein synthesis are implicated in
KLF4 upregulation in the context of acquired proteasome
inhibitor resistance [72].
Overexpression of KLF4 in MM cells was
previously reported to result in cell cycle arrest [19]. We
also observed that very high levels of exogenous KLF4
expression reduced proliferation rates in KMS-11 and
KMS-34 cells, with diminished transgene expression in
cell populations that exhibited a growth advantage after
1 month of culture (Figure S3). In this regard, KLF4 has
been reported to exert growth suppressive effects in B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma [37], yet a recent study found
that high nuclear expression of KLF4 in Burkitt pediatric
lymphoma was indicative of inferior overall survival
[73]. Thus, as in other systems [16], KLF4 regulation of
B cell proliferation is complex and likely dependent on
multiple factors. Along these lines, KLF4 was originally
characterized as an epithelial oncogene by Rupert’s group
imparting a slow growth phenotype to the transformed

were also taken into account, significantly inferior overall
survival outcomes were observed (HR = 51.21; 95%
CI, 7.36-356.61; P = 1.0 x 10-4) (Figure 7D). Moreover,
reduced tumor cell metabolism (e.g., as exemplified by
low HMGCR or LDHA expression) was also associated
with adverse outcomes, with high expression ratios of
KLF4 to HMGCR (HR = 3.47; 95% CI, 1.61-7.48; P =
0.02) (Figure 7E) and KLF4 to LDHA (HR = 3.74; 95%
CI, 1.66-8.43; P = 0.001) (Figure 7F) prognostic of poor
3-year survival rates.

DISCUSSION
The molecular mechanisms associated with
the development of clinical resistance to proteasome
inhibitors remain to be fully elucidated [4-8]. Toward
this end, we have endeavored to establish clinicallyrelevant carfilzomib-resistant MM cell lines [60]. In a
previously published study, we found that upregulation
of the ABCB1-encoded multidrug resistance efflux
transporter P-glycoprotein contributed to increased
carfilzomib resistance in KMS-34 MM cells cultured
in low concentrations (6 nM) of the drug [13]. Notably,
our analysis of microarray data acquired for a MM
patient treated with carfilzomib revealed increased
ABCB1 expression during disease progression [61],
suggesting that the mechanism could be relevant to
carfilzomib resistance observed in the clinic [62]. To
further elaborate mechanisms of carfilzomib resistance
in MM, we adapted KMS-34/Cfz to growth in 12 nM
carfilzomib and likewise established KMS-11/Cfz
cells resistant to 12 nM carfilzomib by exposure to
stepwise increasing concentrations of the drug. Unlike
KMS-34/Cfz, KMS-11/Cfz did not exhibit increased
expression of ABCB1. Instead, we found that a common
mechanism of carfilzomib resistance was elevated levels
of prosurvival autophagy, and that the pluripotencyassociated transcription factor KLF4 [15] contributed
to the carfilzomib-resistant phenotype. Our findings are
in accord with those of two publications that appeared
during revision of this manuscript reporting that KLF4
participates in autophagic pathways activated during stress
responses in other settings [63, 64].
Substrates destined for selective autophagic
destruction are recognized by receptor proteins which
anchor the material to the expanding phagophore
membrane via co-binding to lipidated LC3B-II [35, 36].
In recent years, the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagylysosome systems, once considered independent processes
for protein degradation, are now regarded as being
interconnected. Impairment of either pathway has been
reported to impact the other. Ubiquitination of proteins
targeted for destruction serves as the mechanism of
crosstalk and ubiquitin-binding cargo protein SQSTM1/
p62 is a critical link [20, 21]. By upregulating SQSTM1/
p62 levels in carfilzomib-resistant MM cells, KLF4

factor that KLF4 target genes in embryonic stem cells
were enriched in the differentially expressed genes in
KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells [28]. These results
suggest potential parallels with putative cancer stem-like
cells [13, 85]. In line with this notion, it has been reported
that overexpression of KLF4 in breast cancer cells led to
an increase of the cancer stem cell-like population [86].
In that work, KLF4-mediated maintenance of stem celllike characteristics was accompanied by increased cell
migration and invasion of the malignant cells. Our future
studies will further examine the mechanistic ramifications
of KLF4 expression as regards relapse and treatment
resistance in MM, and the utility of the KMS-11/Cfz and
KMS-34/Cfz MM models for the development of novel
autophagy-targeting combination therapies.

cells [74]. In follow-up studies of breast cancer cases,
these investigators found that small primary tumors having
preferential nuclear localization of KLF4 correlated with
an increased risk of death [30]. The relative proliferative
activity of WHSC1-positive KLF4-expressing MM cells
with respect to other MM samples in the PR subgroup
defined by Shaughnessy and colleagues [58] is not
known. However, the fact that the hazard ratio increased
significantly for these MM patients upon consideration of
autophagy-associated gene expression levels (Figure 7D),
implicates activation of autophagy as a contributing factor
to relapsed/refractory disease.
Beyond its function as a direct cell cycle regulator,
KLF4 exerts inhibitory effects on metabolic pathways
and macromolecular synthesis [75], which include
repression of genes encoding key enzymes involved in
glycolysis and cholesterol biosynthesis (i.e., HMGCR,
HMGCS1, MVK, LDHA) [42, 44]. Recent studies have
shown that autophagy plays important roles in glucose
homeostasis and lipid metabolism [76, 77], and the
inverse relationship between autophagy and cell growth
is becoming increasingly appreciated [78]. Although the
KLF4 metabolic target genes in Figure 3C, including
HMGCR and LDHA were only modestly downregulated
upon acquisition of carfilzomib resistance, inhibition of
HMGCR or LDHA enzymatic activity has resulted in
autophagy induction in cancer cells [79, 80]. Furthermore,
high gene expression ratios of KLF4 to HMGCR and
KLF4 to LDHA were associated with adverse outcomes of
certain MM patients (Figure 7E, 7F). Collectively, these
results may raise a cautionary note regarding potential
anti-MM therapeutic strategies that target these metabolic
enzymes [81, 82].
KLF4 levels decrease during B cell activation
and differentiation into plasma cells [25-27]. Increased
expression of KLF4 in the carfilzomib-resistant
KMS-11/Cfz and KMS-34/Cfz cells was indicative
of “dedifferentiation” to an earlier maturation stage
(Figure 1). Negative regulation of SLAMF7 encoding
plasma cell-specific CD319 [27, 31] by ectopic KLF4
expression in KMS-11 cells (Table 1) suggests a potential
role in the process. That this MM cell line phenomenon
is biologically relevant is supported by work from
Yaccoby who first described the ability of primary MM
cells to dedifferentiate into an immature plasmablastic
phenotype upon long-term co-culture on osteoclasts [83].
More recently, Karadimitris and colleagues reported
epigenetic plasticity in MM patient samples and xenograft
assays, where clinical drug resistance was attributed
to bidirectional transitions between MM plasma cells
and more quiescent pre-plasma cells [84]. Our results
also complement the recent findings of Tiedemann and
colleagues implicating less mature pre-plasma cells
as contributing to therapeutic proteasome inhibitor
resistance in MM [7]. Considered from this perspective,
it is notable in view of its activity as a reprogramming

Confocal microscopy
Cells (2.5 x 105) were centrifuged onto a microscope
slide at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes using a Shandon Cytospin
4 instrument. The cells were then immediately fixed in
3.7% formaldehyde for 5 minutes at room temperature
and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Following permeabilization, the cells were rinsed with
PBS and blocked in PBS containing 10% goat serum and
0.01% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room temperature. The
cells were then incubated with anti-KLF4 and anti-eIF4E
antibodies diluted to final concentrations of 0.4 µg/ml,
in PBS containing 1% goat and 0.01% Triton X-100 for
1 hour at room temperature. The cells were rinsed with
PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) diluted
1:500 in PBS containing 1% goat serum and 0.01%
Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells
were rinsed with PBS and mounted with Fluoromount
G (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Cells expressing
the GFP-LC3 reporter were fixed in 1% methanol free
paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in
PBS overnight at 4oC then centrifuged onto a microscope
