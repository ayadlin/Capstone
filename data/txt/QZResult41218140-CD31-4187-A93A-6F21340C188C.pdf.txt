Abstract
Activation of the PI3K pathway occurs commonly in a wide
variety of cancers. Experience with other successful targeted
agents suggests that clinical resistance is likely to arise and may
reduce the durability of clinical beneﬁt. Here, we sought to
understand mechanisms underlying resistance to PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deﬁcient cancers. We generated cell lines resistant
to the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 from parental PTEN-null
breast cancer cell lines and identiﬁed a novel PIK3CB D1067Y
mutation in both cell lines that was recurrent in cancer patients.
Stable expression of mutant PIK3CB variants conferred resistance to PI3K inhibition that could be overcome by downstream AKT or mTORC1/2 inhibitors. Furthermore, we show

that the p110b D1067Y mutant was highly activated and
induced PIP3 levels at the cell membrane, subsequently promoting the localization and activation of AKT and PDK1 at the
membrane and driving PI3K signaling to a level that could
withstand treatment with proximal inhibitors. Finally, we
demonstrate that the PIK3CB D1067Y mutant behaved as an
oncogene and transformed normal cells, an activity that was
enhanced by PTEN depletion. Collectively, these novel preclinical and clinical ﬁndings implicate the acquisition of activating
PIK3CB D1067 mutations as an important event underlying
the resistance of cancer cells to selective PI3K inhibitors.

Introduction

PI3K inhibitor resistance through preclinical modeling is likely to
help guide clinical hypothesis testing. Ultimately, understanding
clinical mechanisms of resistance can provide a rationale for
therapeutic combinations, sequencing, or alternative therapies
that can overcome resistance mechanisms. For example, preclinical modeling of acquired resistance to B-Raf proto-oncogene,
serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), and MEK inhibitors has provided
the rationale for clinical testing of combination therapy involving
BRAF and MEK inhibitors (9).
Previous preclinical studies of acquired resistance to PI3K
inhibitors have mostly been conducted in the background of
PIK3CA-activating mutations, particularly the hotspot H1047R or
E545K alleles. Those studies identiﬁed several mechanisms of
resistance involving both PI3K pathway reactivation as well as
activation of parallel pathways. In the case of downstream PI3K
activation, studies in a mouse mammary tumor model engineered
to express an activated PIK3CA allele (H1047R) demonstrated
that activation of the Myc oncogene rendered these tumors resistant to selective PI3K inhibitors (10, 11). Gene ampliﬁcation of
the downstream effector, eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E (eIF4E), and overexpression of the ribosomal protein S6
kinase, 90kDa, polypeptides 3 and 4 (RSK3 and RSK4) have also
been shown to confer resistance to PI3K inhibitors (11, 12).
Mechanisms acting upstream of PI3K have also been described,
including dysregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and
c-MET, and overexpression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin
(AREG) in the background of PTEN loss (10, 13, 14). In terms
of mechanisms acting at the level of the target itself, previous work
from our laboratory showed that PIK3CA H1047R gene ampliﬁcation causes resistance to pan-PI3K inhibition by hyperactivating PI3K signaling (15). In short-term experiments, p110b kinase
can be adaptively activated and can restore PI3K signaling when

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is pathologically activated in
many tumor types. In particular, the phosphatidylinositol-4,5bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) is frequently mutated and activates the pathway (1). The regulatory
subunits of PI3K, PIK3R1, and PIK3R2 (2), and the downstream
effector AKT1 (3) can also be mutated and hyperactivate the
pathway. Activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN is frequently
lost in diverse cancer types by mutation or gene deletion, and
PTEN-deﬁcient cancers show dramatically elevated PI3K signaling
(4). Inhibitors designed to target p110a, mTOR, or AKT, as well as
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, are in various stages of clinical
development (5), and mTOR is a clinically validated target in
renal cell carcinoma (6) and hormone receptor–positive breast
cancer (7). However, experience with other successful targeted
agents suggests that clinical resistance is likely to arise and may
reduce the durability of clinical beneﬁt (8). As with other targeted
agents, understanding the diversity of mechanisms that give rise to

p110a is selectively inhibited in cancer cells harboring a PIK3CA
mutation (16). In addition, convergent loss of PTEN has been
shown to arise in multiple metastatic lesions in a breast cancer
patient harboring a PIK3CA mutation treated with a p110aselective inhibitor (17).
To date, relatively little is known about PI3K inhibitor resistance in PTEN-deﬁcient cancers. In this type of cancer, p110b and
mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are critical for cancer progression
(18, 19). One study has shown that p110b-selective inhibition in
PTEN-mutated tumors relieves feedback suppression of several
receptor tyrosine kinases and activates p110a, conferring resistance to p110b-selective inhibition (20). However, the diversity of
resistance mechanisms in PTEN-deﬁcient cancer is relatively
unclear. Here, we sought to understand mechanisms of acquired
resistance to PI3K inhibition in PTEN-mutant EVSA-T and ZR75-1
cells by selecting resistant derivatives that were able to grow in the
presence of high concentrations (>1 mmol/L) of the pan-PI3K
inhibitor, GDC-0941. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a
PIK3CB mutation at the D1067 position in EVSA-T cells, and
digital PCR identiﬁed the same mutation in ZR75-1 cells. Analysis
of TCGA datasets revealed recurrent mutations at this amino acid
in PIK3CB in diverse cancers. Functional studies showed that
knockdown of PIK3CB in resistant clones suppressed cell proliferation, and overexpression of mutant PIK3CB conferred crossresistance to PI3K inhibitors but not downstream inhibition at the
level of AKT or below. Detailed characterization of D1067Y/A/Vmutant proteins suggested that they are all functionally activating
and can increase levels of membrane bound PIP3, leading to
higher levels of phospho-AKT and overall PI3K signaling, and are
transforming in nontumorigenic Rat-2 cells. These results suggest
an oncogenic role for PIK3CB-activating mutations, and implicate
p110b activation as a novel resistance factor for selective PI3K
inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Reagents, cell lines, and tumor samples
Inhibitors for GDC-0941, GDC-0032, GDC-0980, GDC0068, GDC-0349, PD0325901, crizotinib, lapatinib, erlotinib,
docetaxel, paclitaxel, and SAHA were produced and supplied by
the Genentech Medicinal Chemistry group (21–27). Other
compounds are described in Supplementary Table S1. The
HEK293, Rat-2, A-498, ZR-75-1, and HCC-1569 cell lines were
from the ATCC; the EVSA-T cell line from Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH; the SUM-52PE
cell line from Asterand. The identity of the isolate used here was
veriﬁed by genotyping with a Multiplex STR assay (Genetica).
EVSA-T parental, resistant clones, and A-498 cells were cultured
in RPMI1640 medium, HEK293 cells in Eagle's Minimum
Essential Medium, and Rat-2 cells in DMEM. All medium
contained 10% FBS and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. PI3K inhibitor–resistant cells were generated as previously described (15).
All lines were obtained between 2000 and 2010. DNA was
isolated from archival FFPE tumor tissue from 72 advanced or
metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients as previously described
(28). Patient tumor samples were from patients enrolled in
study PIM4973g (NCT01442090), which was conducted in
accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the
Declaration of Helsinki (29). Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients in agreement with approved protocols from ethics committees at each study site.

Cell viability assay, apoptosis assay, and small RNAi assay
Compound screening was performed and cell viability was
assessed using CellTiter Glo ATP Luminescence assay (Promega)
as described previously (22) and apoptosis induction was measured using Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega). PIK3CA, PIK3CB,
and PTEN individual siRNAs and nontargeting control siRNAs
were from Dharmacon (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Reverse transfections
were conducted with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). Four days after transfection, cell viability was assessed or cell
lysates were collected.
Western blot analysis
Cells were treated with inhibitors or a solvent control (0.1%
DMSO) for 4 hours and lysed in T-PER cell extraction reagent
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Protein concentrations were
determined by BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Cell lysates
were resolved by electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF or
nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis was performed
as described previously (30). Antibodies to phospho-Ser473-AKT,
phospho-Thr308-AKT, AKT, phospho-Ser240/Ser244-S6, phospho-Ser235/Ser236-S6, S6, p110alpha, p110beta, PDK1,
GAPDH, Myc-tag, E-cadherin, PTEN, and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit IgG were
from Cell Signaling Technology.
PCR, Sanger sequencing, cloning, and exome sequencing
PCR (42 cycles of 10 seconds at 94 C, 15 seconds at 55 C, and 1
minute at 68 C) was performed with Platinum PCR supermix (Life
Technologies) and the primers 50 -GACTCTCTTGCATTAGGG-30
and 50 -TGCAAAGTCAGCAGGAAATG-30 . PCR products were
sequenced with the following primers: 50 -GGGAAGAGTGAAGAAGAAG-30 and 50 -CATCGGGGATTGTTCAGATT-30 . The pReceiverM43 plasmid encoding wild-type (WT) PIK3CB (NP_006210.1)
was from GeneCopoeia. The D1067Y, D1067A, D1067V, and
K805R mutants were generated by the GeneArt Site-Directed Mutagenesis PLUS System (Life Technologies). For generation of Rat-2–
stable cell lines, the sequence corresponding to PIK3CB WT or
D1067Y was inserted into pEF1/Myc-His vector by GenScript.
Exome sequencing of parental and resistant cell lines was done as
described previously, and the prevalence of PIK3CB mutations was
determined using exome sequencing data from a panel of cancers
downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and processed as described previously (31, 32). Sequencing data were
ﬁltered for nonsynonymous coding variants not present in dbSNP
and present at >20% allele frequency in the resistant pool only.
Gene copy number analysis
Relative gene copy number for a panel of cancer-related genes
was determined using quantitative PCR. Threshold cycles (Ct)
were measured using cell line genomic DNAs and gene-speciﬁc
TaqMan Copy Number Assays (Life Technologies) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Two assays for each gene were
used. Relative copy numbers were calculated by DDCt method as
previously described (28) using RNaseP (Life Technologies) as a
reference and pooled human blood genomic DNA (Roche) as a
calibrator sample.
Transient transfection and generation of stable transfectants
Cells were seeded at 1–3  105 cells per well to a 12-well plate
and were transfected with expression constructs on the next day,

PIK3CB Mutations Confer Resistance to PI3K Inhibitors

using Lipofectamine3000 reagent (Life Technologies). At 2 days
after transfection, cells were lysed for Western blot analysis.
Stable transfectants were generated separately using geneticin or
puromycin.
Droplet digital PCR
Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) probe assays were designed to
detect the following single nucleotide variations in the PIK3CB
gene: D1067A, D1067V, and D1067Y Assay sequences were:
forward, TTAGGAGCGAAGGCTG; reverse, GTGAACTGGATGGCCC; WT probe, ACAGTTCGGAAAGACTACA; D1067A probe,
ACAGTTCGGAAAGCCTACAGA; D1067V Probe, ACAGTTCGGAAAGTCTACAGA; D1067Y Probe, ACAGTTCGGAAATACTACA. All assays were performed on the QX200 Droplet Digital
PCR System (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Samples were assessed for the presence of PIK3CB mutations
using 20 ng input DNA to achieve a sensitivity of approximately
0.01%, and, where evaluable, mutant allele frequencies were
calculated using QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad).
PIP3/PI(4,5)P2 quantiﬁcation and membrane/cytosol
fractionation
Cells were seeded at 3  106 cells to 10-cm dish and cultured
until they reached approximately 80% conﬂuence. For PIP3/PI
(4,5)P2 quantiﬁcation, phospholipids were isolated and PIP3
and PI(4,5)P2 levels were measured using ELISA kits (Echelon).
For membrane/cytosol fractionation, cells were lysed and membrane or cytosol proteins were fractionated using a Cell Fractionation Kit (Cell Signaling Technology).
ATP competition assay
The ability of GDC-0941 to compete with ATP for binding to
kinases was measured using the Pierce Kinase Enrichment Kit
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Cell lysates were incubated with GDC-0941
at the desired concentration and desthiobiotin-ATP probe. Then,
biotinylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with avidin agarose beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted
using standard procedures.
Focus formation, colony formation, and spheroid formation
assays
Stably transfected Rat-2 cells were seeded to 6-well plates, and
after 20 days incubation, focus formation was observed. Colony
formation activity of stably transfected Rat-2 cells was measured
with a CytoSelect 96-Well Cell Transformation assay kit (Cell
Biolabs, Inc.) after 15 days of culture. For the spheroid formation
assay, stably transfected Rat-2 cells were seeded to Nunclon
Sphera Microplates (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and incubated for 7 or
21 days. Cell morphologies and cell viabilities were measured as
previously described (33).

Results
PTEN-mutated EVSA-T breast cancer cells show broad
cross-resistance to PI3K inhibitors but maintain p110b
signal dependency
To understand the resistance mechanisms underlying PI3K
inhibition in PTEN-deﬁcient cancer, we generated a model resistance to a pan-PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941, using the PTEN-mutated luminal breast cancer cell line, EVSA-T. This cell line has
previously been shown to be sensitive to GDC-0941 (22).

www.aacrjournals.org

PI3K-resistant EVSA-T cells were selected by culturing in gradually
increasing concentrations of GDC-0941 until a pool of cells was
able to stably grow at a concentration of 1 mmol/L drug, at which
point ﬁve single cell clones were isolated. Resistance of the selected
EVSA-T clones to GDC-0941 was evaluated in an ATP-based cell
viability assay as well as a caspase-based apoptosis induction assay
(Fig. 1A). The IC50 for cell viability in each of the clones was 10- to
15-fold higher than that of parental cells, and apoptosis seen in
the parental line was not apparent in any of the resistant clones.
Consistent with these observations, phosphorylation of AKT and
S6 was maintained in the presence of 1 mmol/L GDC-0941 for 4
hours in resistant clones but not parental cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1). To further characterize pathway effects of PI3K inhibition
in resistant cells, parental and resistant cells were treated for 4
hours with a serial dilution of GDC-0941 and the level of
phospho-AKT was analyzed (Fig. 1B). GDC-0941 was less effective at suppressing these phospho-epitopes in resistant clones,
resulting in at least a 10- to 30-fold increase in IC50 in both clones
analyzed, suggesting that EVSA-T PI3K-resistant clones show
resistance to the effects of GDC-0941 on signal transduction. To
identify the pathway dependencies in EVSA-T–resistant cells, we
determined sensitivity of parental and resistant lines to an array of
20 compounds that inhibit diverse signaling pathways. First, to
assess whether EVSA-T–resistant clones maintain any dependency
on the PI3K pathway, we evaluated the effects of the AKT inhibitor,
GDC-0068 and the TORC1/2 inhibitor, GDC-0349 PI3K signal
modulation activity and on cell growth inhibitory activity. Parental and resistant clones also showed similar modulation of phospho-AKT and phospho-S6 in response to GDC-0068 or GDC0349 (Fig. 1B). The cell growth–inhibitory activity of GDC-0068
or GDC-0349 was also similar in parental cells and resistant clones
(Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2). Resistant clones were less
sensitive than parental cells to the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
GDC-0980 in terms of cell growth–inhibitory effects and phospho-AKT and phospho-S6 modulation, perhaps due to a difference in potency between GDC-0980 and GDC-0349 on mTOR
inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3). EVSA-T–resistant clones displayed cross-resistance to a wide array of PI3K inhibitors, including another pan-PI3K inhibitor, CH5132799 (34), the PI3Kb
sparing inhibitor, GDC-0032, the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, GDC0980, and PI3Kb-selective inhibitors, TGX-221 (35), AZD6482
(36), and GSK2636771 (37) in cell viability assays (Supplementary Fig. S4). Consistently, phospho-AKT and phospho-S6 were
not suppressed in EVSA-T–resistant clone cells by GDC-0032 or
TGX-221 (Supplementary Fig. S5). In general, the parental cell and
resistant clones showed similar response to other targeted therapies and chemotherapeutic agents (Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Figs. S5 and S6). To determine whether resistant clones still
depend on PI3K itself or have developed a bypass resistance
mechanism, we knocked down PIK3CA and PIK3CB with siRNA
treatment. Although PIK3CB siRNA treatment suppressed cell
proliferation and phospho-AKT (Fig. 1D) in both EVSA-T parental
cells and clones, PIK3CA siRNA treatment showed no effect. Thus,
EVSA-T single clones show broad resistance to PI3K inhibition but
maintained dependency on p110b expression and signaling.
The recurrent PIK3CB mutations D1067Y/A/V are sufﬁcient to
confer resistance to PI3K inhibitors
To identify possible mechanisms underlying resistance, we ran
a comprehensive panel of assays including whole-exome sequencing and a quantitative copy number variation assay for 35 genes,

PIK3CB Mutations Confer Resistance to PI3K Inhibitors

using DNA derived from both EVSA-T parental cells and resistant
derivatives. Whole-exome sequencing identiﬁed a mutation in
PIK3CB predicted to result in a D1067Y substitution in the
C-terminal region of p110b in EVSA-T–resistant pool cells (Supplementary Fig. S7; Supplementary Table S2). Filtering of the
sequencing data for variants present at >20% allele frequency in
the resistant pool resulted in a total of 43 sequence variants. We
focused on the PIK3CB-predicted variant D1067Y, present at 32%
allele frequency, due to the known functional role of PIK3CB in
PI3K pathway activity. The mutation was conﬁrmed by Sanger
sequencing and ddPCR in all ﬁve resistant clones but not parental
EVSA-T cells (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S8). Although a
mutant allele frequency of 50% might have been expected in these
single cell clones if EVSA-T were diploid for the PIK3CB gene,
EVSA-T parental cells carry more than two copies of the PIK3CB
gene (data not shown). We did not ﬁnd any other copy number
alterations or mutations in PI3K pathway related genes or known
genes associated with resistance to PI3K inhibition, such as Myc or
c-Met, in EVSA-T–resistant clones (Supplementary Fig. S9; ref. 31).
To determine whether this putative mechanism of resistance via
PIK3CB mutation was generalizable beyond EVSA-T, we selected
for GDC-0941 resistance in three other PTEN-deﬁcient breast
cancer cell lines, ZR-75-1, HCC-1569, and SUM-52PE (Supplementary Fig. S10) and screened resistant pools for PIK3CB mutation using ddPCR. We found the same alteration, D1067Y, at an
allele frequency of 1.5% in a resistant pool of the luminal PTENdeﬁcient breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-1 (Fig. 2A). As with EVSA-T,
we did not detect the PIK3CB mutation in parental ZR-75-1 cells
using ddPCR. If the mutation was present as a pre-existing clone in
parental cell lines, it would have occurred at a frequency of less
than 1 in 10,000 cells based on the 0.01% sensitivity of the ddPCR
assay. To determine whether amino acid substitutions at this
position occur more broadly in tumor specimens, we searched
TCGA data (38, 39) and found recurrent PIK3CB mutations at
position D1067 in cancer patients, with D1067Y, D1067A, and
D1067V mutations in PIK3CB all annotated. Also, we found one
of 72 patients had the PIK3CB D1067V mutation in a collection of
metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma samples (Table 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S11). To functionally characterize these recurrent mutations and their role in resistance and transformation, we
established stable derivatives of EVSA-T cells expressing wild-type
(WT), D1067Y, D1067A, or D1067V variants. In cell viability
experiments, mutant expressing cells were less sensitive to GDC0941 than WT-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, basal phospho-AKT levels were elevated in D1067Y/A/V–stable cell lines
compared with WT lines, and 4-hour GDC-0941 treatment did
not suppress phospho-AKT in mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 2B).
Consistent with the previous data in the selected resistant clones,
the EVSA-T expressing PIK3CB mutant showed cross-resistance to
GDC-0032 and TGX-221, but maintained sensitivity to GDC0068 and GDC-0349 (Fig. 2C). Consistent with cross-resistance to
GDC-0032 and TGX-221 of both stably and transiently expressing
mutants (Supplementary Fig. S12), these inhibitors could only
partially suppress PI3K signaling at the level of phospho-AKT and

could not suppress phospho-S6 in stably expressing mutants
(Supplementary Fig. S13). To additionally test whether an endogenously occurring PIK3CB mutation results in intrinsic resistance
to PI3K inhibition, we characterized a renal cancer cell line, A498,
harboring a PIK3CB D1067V mutation. Although A498, like
EVSA-T, depends on p110b signaling (Supplementary Fig.
S14), A498 was substantially less sensitive to GDC-0941 than
EVSA-T in a cell viability assay (A498: IC50 1.1 mmol/L, EVSA-T:
IC50 0.037 mmol/L) and required higher concentrations to suppress phospho-AKT (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that the recurrent PIK3CB mutations, D1067Y, D1067A, and
D1067V are sufﬁcient to confer intrinsic and acquired resistance
to upstream PI3K inhibition.
Mechanistic characterization of PIK3CB mutation mediated
PI3K resistance
To establish that resistance to GDC-0941 was not due to differential binding, we conﬁrmed that the binding afﬁnity of GDC-0941
to p110b kinase in EVSA-T parental cells and resistant clones was
comparable by using an ATP competition assay (Supplementary
Fig. S15). Then, to clarify how PIK3CB mutants can confer resistance to PI3K inhibitors, we characterized the effect of these
mutations on downstream PI3K pathway signaling. Because resistant clones of EVSA-T harboring the PIK3CB D1067Y mutation
showed higher phospho-AKT levels than EVSA-T parental cells at
baseline (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S16), we expressed
PIK3CB WT or D1067Y mutant transiently in EVSA-T to evaluate
whether PIK3CB mutants can further potentiate phospho-AKT
levels. p110b WT or D1067Y-mutant protein levels increased in
proportion to the amount of input DNA, while phospho-AKT
levels, especially at threonine 308, showed a proportional increase
in PIK3CB D1067Y-mutant cells but not WT-overexpressing cells
(Fig. 3B). Similarly, PIK3CB D1067A or D1067V mutant transiently
expressing HEK293 cells showed higher phospho-AKT levels than
PIK3CB WT-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C). As AKT activation
may also occur via a kinase activity–independent mechanism, we
expressed a kinase-dead (KD)-mutant PIK3CB (K805R) in HEK293
and conﬁrmed that neither PIK3CB WT nor PIK3CB D1067Y/A/V
KD mutants could potentiate AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3D).
These results suggest that the PIK3CB D1067Y/A/V mutants have
increased catalytic activity and required kinase activity, and potently activate downstream PI3K signaling.
Because measurement of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PI(4,5)P2) levels provide a direct assay for PI3K catalytic activity
(16), we evaluated PIP3 and PI(4,5)P2 levels in resistant clones
of EVSA-T harboring the PIK3CB D1067Y mutation. The resistant
clones showed approximately 8-fold higher PIP3/PI(4,5)P2 ratio
than EVSA-T parental cells at baseline (Fig. 4A). To investigate the
biologic consequences of elevated PIP3 levels, we fractionated
membrane and cytosolic proteins from EVSA-T parental cells and
resistant clone cells, and determined the localization of downstream molecules that are recruited to the membrane by PIP3
binding. Consistent with the higher amount of PIP3 at the

(Fig. 4B). We fractionated membrane and cytosolic proteins from
EVSA-T PIK3CB mutant stably expressing cells (D1067Y, D1067A,

with GDC-0941 at 1 mmol/L for 4 hours and measuring the PIP3/
PIP(4,5)2 ratio. Baseline levels of PIP3 in resistant clones were
signiﬁcantly higher than that in parental cells, and while GDC0941 treatment suppressed PIP3 in resistant cells, remaining PIP3
levels were substantially higher than in parental cells treated with
similar doses of GDC-0941 (Fig. 4D). These results are consistent

PIK3CB D1067Y formed more colonies in soft agar and constructed larger spheroids than Rat-2 cells expressing PIK3CB WT
(Fig. 5A). Cell viability in the colony formation assay and the
spheroid formation assay was measured by an ATP-based cell
viability assay and was found to be enhanced in D1067Y cells
compared with WT (Fig. 5B). Finally, to determine whether PTEN
loss can potentiate transforming activity of the PIK3CB mutation,
we performed PTEN siRNA in Rat-2–stable cell lines and showed
that spheroid forming activity of Rat-2 cells expressing PIK3CB
D1067Y was enhanced by PTEN knockdown (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
In this study, we sought to deﬁne resistance mechanisms for
PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deﬁcient breast cancer. Previous studies
have shown that PTEN-deﬁcient cancers tend to signal through
p110b rather than p110a (18). Consistent with this, our siRNA
experiments indicated that EVSA-T PTEN-deﬁcient breast cancer
cells depend on p110b signaling rather than p110a. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing of derived GDC-0941–resistant
EVSA-T cells identiﬁed a novel PIK3CB D1067Y mutation. This
phenomenon was not unique to EVSA-T cells, as we found the
identical mutation in a GDC-0941–resistant derivative pool of
another PTEN-deﬁcient breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-1. Although
present at a low frequency of 1.5% in ZR-75-1 cells, the mutation
could be contributing to one of multiple resistance mechanisms
in this heterogeneous-resistant pool, and its occurrence in two

independent PTEN-deﬁcient lines treated with GDC-0941 supports the notion that PIK3CB is a common target for PI3K
inhibitor escape in the PTEN-null setting. These ﬁndings suggest
that PTEN-deﬁcient cancers are intrinsically dependent on p110b
signaling and may acquire the mutation to maintain the p110b
signaling in the presence of a PI3K inhibitor. This observation is
reminiscent of our observation that PIK3CA-mutant KPL-4 cells
develop resistance by amplifying the mutant allele of PIK3CA and
hyperactivating signaling to maintain pathway activation in the
presence of PI3K inhibitors (15).
Surprisingly, PIK3CB mutations at the identical position were
also found recurrently in non-treated cancer patients and the
A498 renal cell cancer cell line. As we observed in EVSA-T and
ZR-75-1 cells expressing mutant PIK3CB, A498 cells harboring a
PIK3CB D1067V mutation showed resistance to GDC-0941.
Although the frequency of PIK3CB mutations in non-treated
cancer patients is relatively low, it nevertheless comprises a
potential innate resistance mechanism for PI3K inhibitors. The
situation may be akin to other cases where a mutation that is
found infrequently in the pretreated patients is also found after
the treatment and can be a prevalent mechanism of resistance.
Such is the case with EGFR, where it is well known that the
acquired gatekeeper mutation, T790M, in EGFR impairs EGFR
inhibitor binding with EGFR and confers resistance (40).
Although it is not common, the same mutation T790M in EGFR
has been found in EGFR inhibitor–na€ve non–small cell lung
cancer (41). Likewise, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations are

rare in endocrine therapy–na€ve breast cancer patients, but are
found at a higher prevalence in metastatic breast cancers following
therapy with aromatase inhibitors. Some of these mutations lead
to ligand-independent estrogen receptor (ER) activation and
others attenuate binding afﬁnity with ER antagonists (42, 43).
Our results suggests a model wherein PTEN-deﬁcient cancers
either acquire the mutation in PIK3CB or select for rare preexisting clones in the presence of PI3K inhibition, suggesting that
screening for PIK3CB D1067Y/A/V mutations patients who have
progressed on PI3K inhibitor treatment may be warranted.
There are several possible mechanisms by which D1067 alterations cause p110b activation. Class I PI3K consists of heterodimers composed of a catalytic (p110) and a regulatory subunit
(p85). p110 kinase activity is associated with the nSH2, iSH2, and
cSH2 domains of p85. Therefore, dysregulation of the interaction
of p110 with p85 can activate p110 kinase activity. For instance,
the nSH2 domain of p85 interacts with the helical domain of
p110 and suppresses p110 kinase activity. In certain cancers,
PIK3CA is mutated at the E545 position in the helical domain.
The p110a E545K mutant no longer interacts with the p85 nSH2
domain and is highly activated (44). The p85 cSH2 domain

www.aacrjournals.org

associates with the C-terminus of p110b but not that of p110a
and inhibits basal p110b kinase activity in the absence of
upstream signaling (45). The D1067 residue is located in the
12th a-helix of p110b, and a mutationally induced conformational change of this helix could theoretically regulate the kinase
activity of p110b by attenuating the binding afﬁnity for the p85
cSH2 domain (46), thereby relieving the inhibitory effect of the
p85 cSH2 domain and increasing basal p110b kinase activity. In
addition, the C-terminus of p110b plays a critical role in phosphorylation of lipid substrate. Although the C-terminal–truncated p110b has higher ATPase activity than WT p110b due to lack of
inhibitory effect by the 12th a-helix, the p110b kinase activity
against lipid substrates is decreased and C-terminal–truncated
p110b cannot induce AKT phosphorylation in cells (46). In this
study, we showed that the increase of AKT phosphorylation by
p110b D1067Y/A/V mutants was dependent on p110b kinase
activity and the phosphorylation of the direct substrate, PI(4,5)
P2, was enhanced in cells expressing the mutant kinase. Our
results are consistent with a model where p110b D1067Y/A/V
mutants might have higher afﬁnity to lipid substrates than p110b
WT, resulting in enhanced signaling compared with WT.

Nakanishi et al.

During the preparation of this manuscript, the PIK3CB D1067V
mutation was reported as a resistance mechanism for erlotinib in
lung cancer and was shown to have oncogenic activity and
sensitize cells to PI3K inhibition (47). In this study, Pazarentzos
and colleagues showed that speciﬁc expression of PIK3CB
D1067V in both NIH-3T3 cells and H3255 NSCLC cells conferred
increased sensitivity of these cells to the p110b isoform–selective
inhibitor TGX-221, suggesting that therapeutic treatment with
p110b-selective inhibitors may be effective in cancers harboring
PIK3CB-activating mutations. We also demonstrated oncogenic
activity of PIK3CB D1067Y mutation in Rat-2 normal cells,
though our results are more consistent with PIK3CB mutations
conferring resistance to PI3K inhibition, based on the nature of
the resistant mutations and the fact that A498 cells harboring a
naturally occurring PIK3CB D1067V mutation were relatively
resistant to GDC-0941 in terms of growth inhibition and phospho-AKT–inhibitory activity. Interestingly, we observed crossresistance of EVSA-T clones to p110b-selective inhibitors TGX221, AZD-6482, and GSK2636771. Furthermore, we found that
EVSA-T cells genetically engineered to stably express PIK3CB
D1067Y/A/V mutations were resistant to TGX-221 as compared
with EVSA-T–expressing PIK3CB WT cells. Although PIK3CBmutant cells may have been expected to respond to p110bselective inhibitors, one important difference between the previous study and our study is PTEN status of the PIK3CB-mutant
models evaluated. Although PIK3CB D1067V mutation confers
sensitivity to a p110b-selective inhibitor in a PTEN WT background in NIH-3T3 and H3255 cells, it appears to confer resistance to this same inhibitor in PTEN deﬁcient EVSA-T and ZR-75-1
cells. These observations support the hypothesis that loss of
negative regulation of PI3K activity by PTEN combined with
increased kinase activity by PIK3CB mutation results in hyperactivation of PI3K signaling to a level that enables escape from
p110b-selective inhibitors. In a PTEN-deﬁcient setting, treatment
with inhibitors targeting nodes downstream of p110b may therefore be required. The notion that efﬁcacy of p110b-selective
inhibition is context-dependent is consistent with previous work
showing an effect of TGX-221 on cell viability in PTEN-negative
but not PTEN-positive cells (48). Indeed, Pazarentzos and colleagues also emphasize that the effects of PIK3CB mutation on
therapeutic efﬁcacy of PI3K inhibitors are likely to be contextspeciﬁc. We also propose treatment with AKT or TORC1/2 inhibitors as a therapeutic option for PIK3CB-mutant cancers based
on our ﬁndings that PIK3CB-mutant cells still maintain sensitivity
and pathway modulation in response to these inhibitors, and by
analogy to the situation in K-ras–mutant tumors, where inhibi-

tion of the downstream node ERK resistance to MEK inhibitors
mediated by upstream activating events (49). Inhibiting PI3K
pathway activity downstream of p110b by using AKT or TORC1/2
inhibitors may also be desirable in PTEN-deﬁcient settings given
the role of p110b in insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis
and the need to spare its activity in normal tissues.
In summary, we demonstrate here for the ﬁrst time that novel
activating PIK3CB D1067Y/A/V mutations confer resistance to
PI3K inhibitors due to hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway and
deﬁning a role for PIK3CB as an activated oncogene. Our results
have implications for the management of patients receiving
targeted PI3K therapies, and suggest that additional therapeutic
options targeted at AKT or mTORC1/2 may be a treatment option
in PI3K therapy–resistant patients.
