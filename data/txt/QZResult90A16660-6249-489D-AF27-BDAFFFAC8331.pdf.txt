Abstract
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not amenable to surgical resection has a high mortality rate, due to
the ineffectiveness and toxicity of chemotherapy. Thus, there remains an urgent need of efﬁcacious drugs that
can combat this disease. In this study, we show that targeting the formation of proangiogenic epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) by the cytochrome P450 arachidonic acid epoxygenases (Cyp2c) represents a new and
safe mechanism to treat NSCLC growth and progression. In the transgenic murine K-Ras model and human
orthotopic models of NSCLC, we found that Cyp2c44 could be downregulated by activating the transcription
factor PPARa with the ligands bezaﬁbrate and Wyeth-14,643. Notably, both treatments reduced primary and
metastatic NSCLC growth, tumor angiogenesis, endothelial Cyp2c44 expression, and circulating EET levels.
These beneﬁcial effects were independent of the time of administration, whether before or after the onset of
primary NSCLC, and they persisted after drug withdrawal, suggesting the beneﬁts were durable. Our ﬁndings
suggest that strategies to downregulate Cyp2c expression and/or its enzymatic activity may provide a safer
and effective strategy to treat NSCLC. Moreover, as bezaﬁbrate is a well-tolerated clinically approved drug
used for managing lipidemia, our ﬁndings provide an immediate cue for clinical studies to evaluate the utility
of PPARa ligands as safe agents for the treatment of lung cancer in humans. Cancer Res; 74(2); 621–31. 2013

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases and has a 5-year survival
rate of only 15% (1). Early-stage NSCLC is potentially curable by
surgery, but its long-term survival after resection is limited by
local or distal recurrences. The best therapy available for
inoperable and/or late-stage NSCLC is radiation with or without chemotherapy (2, 3). In addition, antiangiogenic therapy
targeting VEGF prolongs survival in patients with lung cancer
(4). However, the outcomes of targeting VEGF are dependent
on cancer type and stage, and often result in the development
of resistance (5), hypertension and proteinuria (6, 7), and death
associated with primary or metastatic disease. Thus, there is
the need for new, more effective, and safer antitumorigenic
and/or antiangiogenic therapies.

The cytochrome P450 arachidonic acid epoxygenases
(CYP2C) oxidize arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids
(EET). EETs stimulate hormonal signaling (8–10) and have
antihypertensive and vasodilatory actions (11, 12). In addition,
we and others characterized the EETs as proangiogenic lipids
both in vitro and in vivo (13–15) and identiﬁed the murine
Cyp2c44 as a proangiogenic epoxygenase (16). Disruption of
the Cyp2c44 gene, or downregulation of its expression via
activation of the PPARa, reduces endothelial cell function in
vitro and primary tumor growth in vivo (17).
Like Cyp2c44, its functional homolog human CYP2C9 is
expressed in endothelial cells and its downregulation reduces
EET biosynthesis and endothelial cell function (17). Interestingly, CYP2C9 is upregulated in the vasculature of human
NSCLC (17), making this epoxygenase an attractive target for
antiangiogenic therapy.
PPARs regulate the transcription of genes involved in lipid
and glucose homeostasis (18). Upon ligand binding, the three
PPAR isotypes PPARa, -b/d, and -g form heterodimers with the
retinoic acid receptor and, in the presence of speciﬁc coactivators, bind to response elements in the promoter region of
their target genes. The PPARa ligands derivatives of ﬁbric acid
are used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and their safety,
tolerance, and minimal side effects are well documented (19,
20). In addition, the PPARa ligands bezaﬁbrate and Wyeth14,643 decrease in vivo hepatic Cyp2c expression and hepatic
and plasma EET levels (16). Wyeth-14,643 decreases Cyp2c44
and CYP2C9 expression and EET biosynthesis in mouse and
human endothelial cells (16, 17). PPARa ligands also exhibit

pro- and antitumorigenic effects. In rodents, extended exposure to ﬁbrates causes PPARa-mediated hepatocarcinoma
(21–23), which is not observed in humans even after extended
exposure to PPARa ligands (24). In contrast, PPARa ligands
decrease intestinal polyp formation in ApcMin/þ mice, inhibit
vascular smooth muscle hyperplasia, induce apoptosis, and
prevent tumor cell invasion (25–27). We showed that Wyeth14,643 inhibits primary growth of human NSCLC cells, its
effects require a functional host PPARa gene, and are associated with PPARa-mediated reduction in endothelial Cyp2c
expression and EET levels (16). Thus, PPARa acts as an
antiangiogenic and antitumorigenic receptor.
A limitation of the primary model of human NSCLC cells
showing beneﬁcial effects of PPARa activation is that the
tumors do not metastasize and do not recapitulate the
steps of tumor progression in human NSCLC (16). In this
study, we used the KRasLA2 mouse model of spontaneous
NSCLC to analyze tumor initiation and growth (28), and a
human orthotopic model of NSCLC to analyze tumor progression and metastasis (29). We show that treatment with
selective PPARa ligands inhibits NSCLC primary and metastatic growth and that their beneﬁcial effects are associated with downregulation of Cyp2c expression in tumorassociated vasculature and EET biosynthesis. This study,
together with the fact that PPARa ligands are in clinical use
as hypolipidemic drugs, suggests that they should be also
safe and well-tolerated drugs for the prevention and treatment of NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
EET analogs
The EET analogs 2-(13-(3-pentylureido)tridec-8(Z)-enamido)succinic acid (EET analog 1) and N-isopropyl-N-(5((2-pivalamidobenzo[d]thiazol-4-yl)oxy)pentyl)heptanamide
(EET analog 2) were generated based on 14,15-EET. The labile
epoxide characteristic of EETs was replaced by urea and amide
bioisosteres, respectively (30). The carboxylate was replaced by
bioisosteres and most of the oleﬁns were removed to minimize
auto-oxidation. EET analogs with these types of modiﬁcations
have been described (31). These two EET analogs can ameliorate cisplatin nephrotoxicity and hypertension-mediated kidney injury in vivo (32, 33).
Cell culture and assays
Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were freshly
isolated from wild type (WT) and Cyp2c44-null (Cyp2c44KO)
mice and cultured as described (17). The large T antigen/ras/
Myc–transformed mouse ﬁbroblast p60.5 cells, lung tumor
cells from KrasLA2 mice, and the human NSCLC A549 cells
transfected with pEGFP-N1 (GFP-A549) were previously generated (16, 28, 29). Cells were authenticated before use by
CD31-positive staining, ability to form tumors in vivo, or GFP
intensity. Cells were cultured for one month from freshly
isolated organs or low-passage frozen stocks. For proliferation, cells were plated (5  103/well; 96-well plate) in
serum-free media with or without EETs (1 mmol/L), or the
EET analogs 1 and 2 (0.125–1 mmol/L; ref. 34). In some
experiments, cells were cultured in 2.5% fetal calf serum with

622

or without different concentrations of Wyeth-14,643. Two
days after, the medium was replaced with medium containing [3H]thymidine (1 mCi/well), the cells incubated for 48
hours, and proliferation was determined as described (16,
17). Two to three independent experiments were performed
in quadruplicate.
In vivo treatment with EET analogs
Animal protocols were approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 129SvJ male
(12 weeks old; n ¼ 9) WT and Cyp2c44KO mice (generated as
described in 17) were given two dorsal subcutaneous injections
of syngeneic p60.5 cells (2  105 in 200 mL PBS; ref. 17).
Cyp2c44KO mice were left untreated or administered the EET
analog 1 or 2 (10 mg/kg in drinking water) four days before
tumor injection and throughout the duration of the experiment. The animals were sacriﬁced 2 weeks after cell injection
and tumor volume and weight were evaluated. Tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula: tumor volume (mm3) ¼
[length (mm)  width (mm)2]/2 (35). The dose of EET analogs
selected was chosen as it did not signiﬁcantly enhance tumor
volume in p60.5 tumor-bearing WT mice after 18 days of
treatment.
The KrasLA2 mouse model of lung cancer
Age- and gender-matched 129SvJ KrasLA2 heterozygotes
(described in 36 and here referred to as KrasLA2) mice were
divided into water-treated [and sacriﬁced at 1 month (group 1),
3 months (group 2), and 5 months (group 4) of age)] or Wyeth14,643–treated (0.02% in drinking water; refs. 16, 17). Among
the Wyeth-14,643–treated mice, one group received treatment
from 1 to 3 months of age and then immediately sacriﬁced
(group 3, early treatment). Another group received treatment
from 3 to 5 months of age and then immediately sacriﬁced
(group 5, late treatment), whereas a third group received
treatment from 1 to 3 months of age and sacriﬁced at 5 months
of age (group 6, treatment withdrawal). At sacriﬁce, the number of tumors visible on the lung surface was counted. Tumors
were divided into three groups: 0 to 2 mm, 2 to 5 mm, and >5
mm tumor diameter. Lungs containing tumors were ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde or frozen in ornithine optimum cutting
temperature and processed for histology or immunoﬂuorescence. Livers and plasma were collected at sacriﬁce for evaluation of liver/body weight ratio and analysis of circulating
levels of EETs.
Orthotopic model of NSCLC
Human GFP-A549 cells (1  106 in 20 mL PBS containing 20
mL Matrigel; BD Pharmingen) were injected into the left lung
parenchyma of 12 weeks old athymic nude mice as described
(29). Mice were then divided into groups of water-treated and
sacriﬁced 5 weeks after injection (group a) or Wyeth-14,643–
treated (0.02% in the drinking water) or bezaﬁbrate (0.3% in
drinking water). Treated mice were divided into 3 groups. One
group was treated immediately after cell injection for 5 weeks
and then sacriﬁced (group b, prevention group). Another group
was treated immediately after cell injection for 2 weeks and
then sacriﬁced 3 weeks later (group c, treatment withdraw). A

Analysis and quantiﬁcation of plasma epoxygenase
metabolites
Mouse plasma was obtained from blood collected in EDTA.
Plasma EETs and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHET) were
extracted in the presence of equimolar mixtures of 2H3-labeled
EETs and 2H8-labeled DHETs (5 ng each). After saponiﬁcation
and puriﬁcation (37), EETs and DHETS were quantiﬁed by
ultra high pressure liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and the isotope ratio method (38).
Western blot analysis
Microsomal fractions from livers or A549 cells were isolated
by differential centrifugation as described (39). Microsomal
proteins (20 mg/well) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and the membranes were incubated with anti-Cyp2c44 (17) or rabbit antihuman CYP2C9 (Abcam) antibodies. Proteins were visualized
using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and an
ECL kit (Pierce). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S
Stain to verify equal loading.

third group received treatment for 3 weeks starting 2 weeks
after injection and then immediately sacriﬁced (group d, late
treatment). Two weeks after tumor cell injection was chosen as
at this time point GFP-A549 cells form only visible primary (left
lung) but not metastatic (right lung and liver) tumors. All mice
were sacriﬁced 5 weeks after tumor cell injection as at this time
point GFP-A549 cells generate both primary and metastatic
tumors (29).
At sacriﬁce, organs (left and right lungs, liver) were removed,
placed under a ﬂuorescence microscope, and the number of
tumors on the surface and within the organs was counted.
Images of GFP-positive tumors were recorded and processed
with the Scion Image software as described (29). Tumor area
was expressed as a percentage of the area occupied by GFPpositive structures per microscopic ﬁeld. Organs containing
tumors were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for
histology or immunohistochemistry. Liver and plasma were
collected for evaluation of liver/body weight ratio and analysis
of circulating levels of EETs.

Statistical analysis
The Student t test was used for comparisons between two
groups (unpaired, 2-tailed), and analysis of variance using
Sigma-Stat software was used to analyze statistical differences
between multiple groups. P  0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
EET analogs promote tumorigenesis and angiogenesis
Disruption of Cyp2c44, the gene that codes for the murine
Cyp2c44 and the major EET generating epoxygenase, leads to
decreased endothelial EET biosynthesis and primary tumor
growth and vascularization (17). To determine whether the
decreased tumorigenesis in the Cyp2c44KO mice was mainly
due to reduced production and levels of EETs, we tested two
synthetic EET functional analogs, namely EET analogs 1 and
2 (see Methods for details). Cyp2c44KO mice received water
or one of the two EET analogs. Four days later, mice were
subcutaneously injected with p60.5 cells and the EET analog
treatment continued for 2 weeks. Mice were then sacriﬁced
and tumor number, weight, and volume were evaluated. As
reported (17), tumors in Cyp2c44KO mice were smaller and
paler compared with those in untreated WT mice (Fig. 1A–
C). In contrast, EET analog–treated Cyp2c44KO mice grew
bigger and more vascularized tumors when compared with
untreated Cyp2c44KO mice, and their size and weight were
similar to those in untreated WT mice (Fig. 1A–C). In
contrast to treated Cyp2c44KO mice, EET analog–treated
WT mice did not grow signiﬁcantly bigger p60.5-derived
tumors when compared with untreated WT mice (not
shown).

As Cyp2c44KO mice show decreased tumor vascularization (17), tumor sections were stained with anti-CD31 antibody. Tumors in Cyp2c44KO mice were signiﬁcantly less
vascularized than those in WT mice, whereas tumors from
EET analog–treated Cyp2c44KO mice showed similar levels
of vascularization as tumors from untreated WT mice (Fig.
1D and E).
We next determined whether the increased tumorigenesis
and angiogenesis in EET analog–treated mice was because
the analogs stimulated proliferation of endothelial and/or
p60.5 cells. At baseline, Cyp2c44KO endothelial cells grew
signiﬁcantly less than WT cells, and their growth was
signiﬁcantly stimulated by the two EET analogs in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1F). In contrast, both EET analogs
failed to promote p60.5 cell proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. S1A).
Thus, EET analogs 1 and 2, at a dose that does not significantly affect tumor growth in WT mice, potentiate primary

Activation of PPARa decreases primary lung cancer
growth
The PPARa ligand Wyeth-14,643 downregulates endothelial Cyp2c44 expression and EET biosynthesis in a mouse
model of subcutaneously injected NSCLC A549 tumor cells,
which leads to reduced primary tumor growth and vascularization (16). As this mouse model is based on the subcutaneous injection of tumor cells, it fails to recapitulate the
steps of NSCLC development seen in humans. To deﬁne the
role of EETs and the effects of PPARa ligands to NSCLC
initiation and growth, we used the KRasLA2 mouse model of
spontaneous primary NSCLC (36). As described in Fig. 2A,
three groups of mice received vehicle (water) and were
sacriﬁced at 1 month (group 1), 3 months (group 2), and
5 months (group 4) of age. Three other groups received
Wyeth-14,643. Group 3 (early treatment) received treatment
from 1 to 3 months of age and then sacriﬁced; group 5 (late
treatment) received treatment from 3 to 5 months of age and
then sacriﬁced; and group 6 (treatment withdrawal) received
treatment from 1 to 3 months of age and sacriﬁced at 5
months of age.
As PPARa activation leads to liver hypertrophy in rodents
(16), we analyzed liver weight of untreated and Wyeth14,643–treated mice. Signiﬁcant liver hypertrophy was
observed in mice in groups 3 and 5. Interestingly, mice in
group 6 (treatment withdrawal) showed a liver/body weight
ratio comparable with that of mice receiving water (Fig. 2B).
As Wyeth-16,463 reduces hepatic Cyp2c44 expression
and plasma EETs (16), we analyzed these parameters in
KrasLA2 mice. Both early and late Wyeth-14,643 administration (groups 3 and 5) resulted in marked reductions in
plasma EET levels and hepatic Cyp2c44 expression (Fig. 2C
and D). Interestingly, mice in the Wyeth-14,643 withdrawal
protocol (group 6) showed similar levels of plasma EETs
and hepatic Cyp2c44 to those of untreated mice (Fig. 2C
and D). Thus, the effects of Wyeth-14,643 on liver hypertrophy, hepatic Cyp2c44 expression, and plasma EET levels
are reversible.
We next analyzed whether early Wyeth-14,643 treatment
reduced the number and size of lung tumors. One-month-old
untreated mice (group 1) presented with a few small tumors
on their lung surface (Fig. 3A–D). The number and size of
lung tumors increased signiﬁcantly when mice reached 3
months of age (group 2) (Fig. 3A–D). By contrast, 3-monthold mice treated with Wyeth-14,643 for 2 months starting at
1 month of age (group 3) showed lung tumor lesions and
numbers comparable with those of group 1 (Fig. 3A–C).
Wyeth-14,643 treatment also decreased tumor size in this
group (Fig. 3D).

We next evaluated the beneﬁcial effects of late treatment
and/or the long-lasting effects of Wyeth-14,643. Five-monthold untreated mice (group 4) were presented with the highest
number and biggest tumors on their lung surface (Fig. 3A–D).
Tumors in groups 5 and 6 were signiﬁcantly fewer and smaller
when compared with those of group 4 (Fig. 3A–D). Thus,
Wyeth-14,643 reduces the number and size of primary lung
tumors, and its beneﬁcial antitumorigenic effects are long
lasting and independent of treatment time.
Activation of PPARa decreases primary lung cancer
vascularization
Activation of PPARa decreases endothelial cell function by
downregulating Cyp2c expression and EET biosynthesis (16).
Therefore, we evaluated vascularization in lung tumors from
the various groups of KrasLA2 mice. A signiﬁcant decrease in
vascularization was evident in tumors of KrasLA2-treated mice
compared with untreated mice and this effect was independent of the length of treatment (Fig. 4A and B). Double
immunostaining with anti-CD31 and anti-Cyp2c44 antibodies
revealed that in the untreated mice, Cyp2c44 was expressed in
the endothelium and tumor tissue, whereas in the tumors
grown in Wyeth-14,643–treated mice, Cyp2c44 expression was
restricted mostly to tumor cells (Fig. 4C and D). Because
Wyeth-14,643 does not affect the in vitro proliferation of lung
tumor cells from KrasLA2 mice (Supplementary Fig. S1B), we
concluded that Wyeth-14,643 only affects endothelial Cyp2c44
expression with no measurable effects on the proliferation of
KrasLA2 lung tumor cells.

Activation of PPARa reduces lung cancer metastasis
Tumors in the KRasLA2 mice rarely metastasize, thus making the analysis of interventional therapy in lung cancer
progression impossible to perform. To determine whether
activation of PPARa is beneﬁcial in cancer progression, we
used a lung orthotopic model in which human NSCLC A549
cells are injected directly into the lung parenchyma of immunodeﬁcient mice (29). Upon injection into the primary site (left
lung), primary tumors form and metastasize to secondary sites
(right lung and liver; ref. 29). We used NSCLC A549 transfected
with GFP (GFP-A549 cells) because (i) they metastasize within
5 weeks of injection (29); (ii) they express PPARa, but lack
CYP2C9, the functional homolog of Cyp2c44 (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and S2B); (iii) they do not produce EETs (Supplementary Fig. S2C); and (iv) their growth is not affected by Wyeth14,643 (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Thus, in contrast to endothelial cells, PPARa ligands do not affect A549 cell growth.
As described in Fig. 5A, injected mice were divided into one
control group (water) and sacriﬁced 5 weeks after tumor cell
injection (group a), or three Wyeth-14,643–treated groups.
Group b (prevention group) was treated for 5 weeks immediately after tumor cell injection and then sacriﬁced; group c
(treatment withdraw) was treated for 2 weeks immediately
after tumor cell injection and sacriﬁced after 5 weeks; and
group d (late treatment) was treated for 3 weeks starting 2
weeks after tumor cell injection and then sacriﬁced.
Analysis of liver hypertrophy revealed that although Wyeth14,643 increased liver/body weight ratio in groups b and d, its
effects were no longer evident when the ligand was withdrawn

after 2 weeks treatment (group c; Fig. 5B). In contrast, plasma
EET levels in Wyeth-14,643–treated mice remained signiﬁcantly
lower compared with untreated mice regardless of the length
and time of treatment (Fig. 5C). The number and size of primary
(left lung) and metastatic (right lung and liver) GFP-A549–
derived tumors were signiﬁcantly reduced in Wyeth-14,643–
treated mice and these effects were independent of the time of
treatment initiation or its duration (Figs. 6 and 7). Thus,
activation of the host PPARa with Wyeth-14,643 reduces both
primary and metastatic growth of human tumor cells.
To explore the generality and potential clinical relevance of
the above results, we performed orthotopic models of NSCLC
using bezaﬁbrate, a PPARa ligand used clinically as a hypolipidemic drug with limited toxicity and excellent tolerance (40).
Early and late treatment with bezaﬁbrate decreased the numbers of primary and metastatic GFP-A549-derived lung tumors
and, as with Wyeth-14,643, these effects were accompanied by
liver hypertrophy and decreased plasma EET levels (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3F). Thus, bezaﬁbrate inhibits lung tumor
progression irrespective of whether it is administered at early
and/or late stages of cancer progression.

Discussion
The goal of this study was to determine whether activation
of PPARa plays a beneﬁcial role in NSCLC progression, based
on the ﬁndings that PPARa ligands reduce primary growth of

www.aacrjournals.org

subcutaneously injected human NSCLC (16) and are safely
used clinically for the treatment of dyslipidemia (40). We show
using two models of NSCLC that PPARa ligands inhibit both
primary and metastatic lung cancer growth, and these effects
are independent of the time of treatment (before or after onset
of primary lesions) or whether the drug is withdrawn. We
further show that the antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic
activity of PPARa ligands reside in their ability to downregulate endothelial cell Cyp2c expression and EET biosynthesis.
Taken together, these results suggest the PPARa/Cyp2c axis is
an attractive target for treating NSCLC.
PPARs regulate different cellular functions including proliferation, thus making PPAR agonists promising drugs for the
treatment of cancer (41). Published data suggest a beneﬁcial
role for PPARg ligands in lung cancer (42). PPARg is upregulated in human lung cancer (43) and activation of PPARg by
troglitazone inhibits lung cancer cell growth (44). Thiazolidinediones, a group of PPARg activating drugs, are associated
with a lower risk of developing lung cancer (45), prevent
smoke-induced lung cancer in mice, and together with glucocorticoids prevent carcinogen-induced lung cancer in rodents
(46, 47). In contrast to these ﬁndings, expression of PPARg in
multidrug-resistant NSCLC cells protects them from cytokinemediated mitoinhibition (48) and the PPARg ligand pioglitazone increases the rate of lung cancer metastasis by promoting
recruitment of anti-inﬂammatory macrophages in mice (49).
Finally, the observation that some of the effects of PPARg
ligands do not require the expression of this nuclear receptor
(50) makes PPARg an ambiguous target for the treatment of
NSCLC.
Unlike PPARg, the signiﬁcance of PPARa ligands to lung
cancer development and progression has received less attention. Fenoﬁbrate and Wyeth-14,643 inhibit A549 cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting that PPARa has antitumorigenic
activity (51). However, these effects were evident only when
the ligands were used at high concentration questioning
PPARa-dependent versus cytotoxic effects. The in vivo antitumorigenic properties of Wyeth-14,643 and fenoﬁbrate have
been reported (16, 52), and we showed that they are PPARa
dependent and are the result of reduced endothelial cell
proliferation and tumor vascularization (16). The beneﬁcial
effects of PPARa ligands seem to reside in their ability to
promote the generation of antiangiogenic factors (52), or to
decrease endothelial Cyp2c44 expression and EET biosynthesis
(16). The ﬁnding that Cyp2c44KO mice show decreased tumor
growth and vascularization, which are no further reduced by
Wyeth-14,643 treatment (17), points to the Cyp2c44 as a
protumorigenic gene and suggests that reduction in Cyp2c44
expression is a major mechanism responsible for the beneﬁcial
antitumorigenic effects of PPARa ligands. Finally, the present
ﬁnding that when used at concentrations known to inhibit
endothelial cell growth, Wyeth-14,643 failed to alter the growth
of human and mouse tumor cells, indicates that its antitumorigenic properties are primarily endothelial and not tumor
cell mediated.
The ﬁnding that synthetic EET functional analogs promote
tumor growth in Cyp2c44KO mice and stimulate tumor angiogenesis and growth to levels comparable with WT mice

supports a central role for epoxygenases and their EET metabolites in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the proangiogenic action of EETs
(53), including potentiation of the VEGF-activated signal
transduction cascade. In this context, EETs induce VEGF
synthesis (54); VEGF promotes CYP2C expression and EET
biosynthesis (55); and disruption of the Cyp2c44 gene (17) and/
or chemical inhibition of epoxygenase activity (56) prevent
VEGF-mediated endothelial cell function.
Tumor metastasis is a serious clinical challenge due to
limited treatment strategies, severe treatment-associated
side effects, and negative outcomes. The two models of
NSCLC used in this study show that PPARa-mediated down-

regulation of endothelial Cyp2c epoxygenase expression and
EET biosynthesis might be viewed as a beneﬁcial and safe
strategy for the prevention and treatment of NSCLC. Consistent with a role for the endothelial Cyp2c/EET axis in
tumor growth and metastasis, mice expressing the human
CYP2C8 in the endothelium develop faster and bigger primary and metastatic tumors compared with WT mice (57).
Moreover, EET administration promotes exit from tumor
dormancy and stimulates metastasis by enhancing tumorassociated angiogenesis (57).

clearly identiﬁes new avenues for cancer treatment and management. The potential clinical usefulness of these results is
further highlighted by the demonstration that bezaﬁbrate, a
safe and well-tolerated drug for the treatment of dyslipidemia
(40), inhibits primary and metastatic NSCLC tumor growth
whether it is administered at early and/or late stages of lung
cancer development. In addition to PPARa, bezaﬁbrate can
also target PPARb/d and PPARg. Interestingly, activation of
PPARb/d and PPARg in lung cancer cells inhibits their proliferation (44, 58). Thus, bezaﬁbrate may be beneﬁcial for the
treatment of lung cancer because it can target both tumor and
endothelial cells and it does not have the severe side effects
often associated with classic antitumorigenic and/or antiangiogenic therapies (5–7).

In conclusion, in this study we identiﬁed two different, yet
interlinked participants to the biology of lung tumor progression, namely Cyp2c epoxygenases and PPARa. We propose
that, in addition to its well-documented role in the metabolism
of carcinogens and anticancer drugs (59), cytochrome P450 is a
key participant in the development and progression of lung
cancer and a potentially valuable target for anticancer drug
development. Furthermore, as PPARa ligands are used clinically as effective and safe hypolipidemic drugs (19, 20), our
study could set the basis for future studies designed to validate
in patients the usefulness of PPARa ligands as new, safer, and
well-tolerated antiangiogenic and antitumorigenic agents.
Targeting PPARa, endothelial Cyp2c epoxygenase, and EETs
with new drugs, designed to interact with these targets either
individually or in combination, could provide new, potent, and
