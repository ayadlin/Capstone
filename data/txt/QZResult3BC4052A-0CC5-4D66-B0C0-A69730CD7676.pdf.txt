Abstract
Most cancers rely on aerobic glycolysis to generate energy and metabolic
intermediates. To maintain a high glycolytic rate, cells must efficiently export lactic
acid through the proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1/4). These
transporters require a chaperone, CD147/BASIGIN (BSG) for trafficking to the plasma
membrane and function.
To validate the key role of these transporters in lung cancer, we first analysed
the expression of MCT1/4 and BSG in 50 non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. These
proteins were specifically upregulated in tumour tissues. We then disrupted BSG in
three NSCLC cell lines (A549, H1975 and H292) via ‘Zinc-Finger Nucleases’. The three
homozygous BSG-/- cell lines displayed a low MCT activity (10- to 5-fold reduction, for
MCT1 and MCT4, respectively) compared to wild-type cells. Consequently, the rate of
glycolysis, compared to the wild-type counterpart, was reduced by 2.0- to 3.5-fold,
whereas the rate of respiration was stimulated in BSG-/- cell lines. Both wild-type and
BSG-null cells were extremely sensitive to the mitochondria inhibitor metformin/
phenformin in normoxia. However, only BSG-null cells, independently of their LKB1
status, remained sensitive to biguanides in hypoxia in vitro and tumour growth in
nude mice. Our results demonstrate that inhibiting glycolysis by targeting lactic acid
export sensitizes NSCLC to phenformin.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the

female cancer deaths, respectively [34]. The overall 5-year

adenocarcinomas (n=29) and other types (n=13). All the
cases had available adjacent non-tumour tissue that was
also studied. We observed that MCT1, MCT4 and BSG
were significantly overexpressed in tumour samples when
compared to adjacent non-tumour tissue (Fig. 1, Table 1).
According to the IARC, the most common histological
types are squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas
[36]. The levels of the three components of the lactate
transport complex differed between the two histological
types. MCT1 and MCT4 were expressed in all squamous
cell carcinoma type cases, and BSG was expressed in 60%
of the cases. MCT1, MCT4 and BSG were expressed in
20%, 30% and 40% of the cases of adenocarcinomas,
respectively (Table 1).

production of lactate is a constant feature of most cancers,
therefore high expression of glucose transporters and
glycolytic enzymes is widely observed [2, 3, 8, 14, 24].
In addition, it is necessary to extrude the lactate produced
to avoid lactic acidosis, which may act as a negative
feedback mechanism to inhibit glycolysis [24, 35].
Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) constitute a family
of 14 proton-linked plasma membrane transporters. Only
MCT1 and MCT4 have been consistently shown to be
upregulated in several human cancers [25] and to play an
important role in maintaining glycolysis. For localization
in the plasma membrane and for activity, these isoforms
require a chaperone named CD147/BASIGIN (BSG) [15,
30, 38]
BSG, also known as EMMPRIN (Extracellular
Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer), is an evolutionary
conserved protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin
(Ig) superfamily. It is a widely distributed heavily
glycosylated type I transmembrane glycoprotein [14, 15]
and is expressed at high levels mainly in metabolically
active cells such as lymphoblasts and malignant tumour
cells [9, 37, 40]. BSG has been proposed to effect
metalloproteinases (MMP) that degrade the extracellular
matrix [37], tumour growth, chemoresistance [12, 13, 41,
42] and metastasis [22, 37]. However, the role of MCTs/
BSG in lung cancer is controversial and poorly elucidated
[16, 20, 27]. Therefore, we aimed to understand the role of
MCTs/BSG in lactic acid extrusion, pH homeostasis and
lung tumour growth. In this study we first observed that
MCT1, MCT4 and BSG were overexpressed in human
lung cancers when compared to adjacent non-tumour
tissue. Therefore, we chose three NSCLC cell lines
(A549, H1975 and H292) one of which was defective
in LKB1 (A549) to analyse the impact of targeting the
MCT activity on energy metabolism, on in vitro cell
proliferation, and on in vivo tumour growth. We exploited
RNA interference knockdown or Zinc Finger Nucleases
knockout of a single gene, BSG, to reduce the activity of
both MCT1 and MCT4. We report that the disruption of
BSG decreased the expression and activity of MCT1 and
MCT4, decreased the rate of glycolysis, increased the
rate of respiration and sensitized the three BSG-/- tumour
cell lines to the inhibition of OXPHOS by metformin/
phenformin (mitochondrial complex I inhibitors) in vitro
and in vivo.

Downregulation of BSG and MCT4 sensitizes
A549 cells to oligomycin in normoxia
After confirming the expression of these biomarkers
in lung tumours and taking into account the overlapping
activity of both MCT1 and MCT4, we decided to
evaluate the effect on growth of MCT4 and BSG
silencing in A549 cells or of MCT1 pharmacological
inhibition (AstraZeneca, iMCT1/2; AR-C155858). The
silencing of MCT4, by shRNA, decreased MCT4 and
BSG expression in hypoxia (Fig. 2A). Moreover, as
expected, BSG silencing induced a parallel decrease in
the expression of MCT1 and MCT4 in both normoxia
and hypoxia (Fig. 2A). Silencing of MCT4 or BSG had
only very modest effect on clonal growth in normoxia
and hypoxia even in the presence of iMCT1/2 (Fig. 2B).
Blockade of OXPHOS by oligomycin did not impact on
the growth rate when the cells were cultured in hypoxia
(1% O2) (Fig. 2B, right panel). By contrast, cell growth
was severely affected in normoxia by oligomycin, which
was magnified in the presence of iMCT1/2 (Fig. 2B).
This experiment demonstrated that hypoxic cells, in spite
of appreciable silencing of MCT4 and MCT1 inhibition,
remained resilient to growth inhibition by targeting
glycolysis. Indeed, shRNA targeting of MCT4 did not
totally abolish the activity of this transporter, and the
residual expression might explain this hypoxic resistance
to MCT1 and OXPHOS blockade. In the absence of a
specific pharmacological inhibitor of MCT4, and taking
into account the interdependency between MCTs and
their chaperone, we decided to develop BSG-null cells to
further explore the role of MCTs in targeting glycolysis
and tumour growth.

identified and selected for further characterization. The site
that was cut was amplified by PCR and the sequence and
mutational independent status of the clones was confirmed
by sequencing. Next, we analysed the expression of the
MCT1 and MCT4 isoforms in normoxia and hypoxia 1%
O2 in these cells Immunoblotting showed that the MCT1
protein was not detectable in BSG-/- A549 cells compared
to wild-type (wt) cells, while MCT4 expression was highly
reduced. We also observed that the non-detectable MCT4
expression in normoxia in BSG-/- cells remained inducible
in hypoxia (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained for the
H1975 (Fig. 4A) and H292 cell lines (data not shown).
Knockout (KO) of the BSG gene in these cells induced a

huge decrease in the protein level of MCT1 and MCT4 in
both normoxia and hypoxia.
Moreover, we demonstrated by qPCR a low level
of transcript expression of BSG, but no evidence of
changes in mRNA expression of MCT1, while MCT4
expression increased by 2-fold in both A549 BSG-/- clones
(Fig. 3B). This stability or even increase in MCT4 mRNA
contrasted with the virtual loss of the corresponding gene
product. We further assessed the impact of BSG disruption
on the in vitro growth rates of the A549- (Fig. 3C, 3D)
and H1975-derived cell lines (Fig. 4B) in normoxia. All
BSG-null cells, excepting the BSG-/- A549 clone (C153),
displayed a normal growth rate compare to the parental
cells (reduction of less than 5% for BSG-/- cells).

BSG gene disruption inhibits the MCT activity
and increases the intracellular lactate pool

the MCT transport activity, BSG-/- A549 cells accumulated
a much higher level of intracellular lactic acid than
parental cells. From 2-3mM lactate in parental cells to
11-12mM in BSG-/- cells (Fig. 3F). Treatment of the cells
with iMCT1/2 further increased the intracellular lactate
pool of the BSG-null cells (20mM) whereas parental cells
remained less sensitive.
In the highly glycolytic H1975 cell line, our results
showed that the BSG disrupted cells accumulated higher
levels of intracellular lactic acid (33mM), than the wildtype cells (3mM) (Fig. 4C) and the BSG-/- A549 cells (Fig.
3F). However, these cells remained less sensitive to MCT1
inhibition due to the high decrease in MCT1 expression of
BSG KO (Fig. 4A).
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that BSG
plays a central role in controlling lactic acid export and
therefore the rate of glycolysis of non-small lung cancer
cells.

We quantified the membrane activity of both MCT1
and MCT4 by a direct measure of the initial rates of
lactic acid transport in hypoxic A549 parental and BSG/cells. The uptake of 14C-lactic acid was measured at a
low external pH (6.0) to favour its entry in the absence
or presence of the specific iMCT1/2 (Fig. 3E). Thus, we
demonstrated that the ability of MCT1 to transport lactate
was severely suppressed (>90%) in BSG-/- cells, while
that of the hypoxia-induced MCT4 is only decreased by
60% compared to parental cells. The transport activity of
MCT1/4 was also evaluated by measuring the intracellular
lactic acid pools (Fig. 3F). After 1h of glucose starvation,
A549-derived cells rapidly accumulated intracellular lactic
acid on addition of glucose to reach an equilibrium state
within 3h. In accordance with the above experiments on

cell lines

were further reduced (1.8-fold) in A549- and H1975derived cell lines in the presence of iMCT1/2, reflecting
inhibition of glycolysis by limiting lactic acid export (Fig.
5A, B). Addition of oligomycin or phenformin stimulated
by 3- to 4-fold ECAR, respectively in wt and BSG-/- A549
cells. However, the ECAR of wt and BSG-/- H1975 cells
was only increased by 1.3- to 1.4-fold, respectively (Fig.
5A, B). These results indicate that, in contrast to the
H1975 cell line, A549 cells were moderately glycolytic
as they only used one third of their glycolytic potential.
By contrast, the OCR values were high in both A549
and H1975 cell lines. These values were even increased in
BSG-null cells compared to wt cells and further increased
in response to MCT1 inhibition (Fig. 5C, D). Respiration
was dramatically reduced in response to the mitochondrial
complex I inhibitor phenformin (Fig. 5C, D).

To further investigate the interplay between
glycolysis and OXPHOS, under the conditions where
lactic acid export was pharmacologically or genetically
reduced, we used the Seahorse XF24 Analyser to measure
the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) of our wt and BSG-/- cell lines.
In the presence of glutamine (2mM) and glucose (10mM),
BSG-null A549 cells showed a 2-fold reduction in
ECAR compared to wt cells (Fig. 5A), whereas the more
glycolytic cell line H1975 (ECAR=40 in H1975 and 10 in
A549) showed a 3.4-fold reduction in ECAR upon BSG
KO compared to parental cells (Fig. 5B). EACR values

MCT inhibition sensitizes lung cancer cells to
phenformin in hypoxia

enzymes through stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF). In sharp contrast to wt cells, BSG-null cells
A549 and H1975 retained a high level of sensitivity to
phenformin/metformin alone or in combination with
iMCT1/2 (Fig. 6A, B). This striking difference between wt
and BSG-null cells in hypoxia could easily be explained
by the failure of BSG-/- cells to express sufficient hypoxiainducible MCT4 to sustain glycolysis (Figs. 3A, 4A).
These results were confirmed in another glycolytic
non-small lung carcinoma cell line, H292, disrupted for
the BSG gene (data not shown), highlighting the fact that
targeting lactic acid export sensitizes lung carcinoma cell
lines to biguanides and thus suppresses their growth in
both normoxia and hypoxia.

Deletion of BSG did not affect in vitro clonal growth
of either A549 or H1975 cells, even in the presence of
iMCT1/2 (Fig. 6A, B). However, only wt A549 cells
displayed an extremely high sensitivity to metformin/
phenformin or oligomycin (not shown), while the more
glycolytic H1975 cells remain insensitive (Fig. 6B). This
is in agreement with the high oxidative/low glycolytic
activity of A549 cells and perhaps also with the loss of
LKB1 (see discussion) (Fig. 6A). However, in hypoxia,
parental A549 cells lost sensitivity to OXPHOS inhibitors,
which is consistent with optimal induction of glycolytic

Combination of inhibition of glycolysis and
OXPHOS decreases tumour growth in vivo

greatly reduced the tumour burden in BSG-/- cells than in
wt cells (Fig. 7A, B). To confirm the expression levels
of BSG and MCTs, tumours were collected at the end of
the experiment and tested by immunohistochemistry. As
expected, BSG and MCT1 expression was not detected in
BSG-/- tumors while MCT4 was present, although with a
weaker expression. Moreover, treatment with phenformin
did not alter the expression of BSG, MCT1 or MCT4.
(Fig. 7C).

To assess the effect of BSG disruption in vivo, we
compared the tumourigenicity of wt and BSG-/- A549 cells.
Nude mice were s.c. injected with both cell populations.
Surprisingly, BSG-/- cells generated bigger tumours than
wt cells (Fig. 7A, B-black lines). However, phenformin

Discussion

decreased expression as detected by immunoblotting (Fig.
3A) and reduced activity in lactic acid transport (Fig. 3E).
Nevertheless, BSG gene disruption did not totally suppress
the activity of MCT4 in these cells.
These results support the idea that MCTs may use
an alternative chaperone for processing to the plasma
membrane, as already suggested previously by our group
[25, 27], or that MCTs alone could reach the plasma
membrane but with a very low efficiency.
Targeting a metabolic pathway can be tricky
due to the high plasticity of the metabolic networks of
cancer cells. Thus, we decided to analyze the impact of
disrupting BSG and OXPHOS on in vitro growth and
tumourigenicity.
The anti-diabetic biguanide drugs metformin
and phenformin used in the clinic have been shown to
inhibit mitochondria complex I [6, 23], with no toxicity
for metformin and little toxicity for phenformin. More
recently, these biguanides have shown interesting new
potential applications in oncology [5, 18, 19, 29, 32]. In
this context, we report here that the three NSCLC parental
cell lines (A549, H292, H1975) or their BSG-/- derivatives
were highly sensitive to metformin or phenformin for in
vitro growth in normoxia as the cells derived their energy
mainly from respiration (Fig. 6A, B and data not shown).
These findings are in good agreement with the report of
Wu and co-workers stating that A549 cells rely more on
OXPHOS than on glycolysis [39]. However, phenformin,
which induced substantially glycolysis (ECAR, Fig. 5A,
B), did not rescue in vitro growth in normoxia (Fig. 6A).
We believe that the low expression of MCT1 and MCT4,
even in parental cells, precluded efficient glycolysis and
therefore proliferation in normoxia. Another explanation
could be related to the toxicity generated by an increase
in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as recently
proposed by Shackelford and co-workers [32]. However,
in hypoxia the three parental cell lines became insensitive
to metformin/phenformin alone or in the presence of
MCT1 inhibitor because MCT4 was highly expressed,
thereby restoring glycolysis. By contrast, the BSG-null
cells, and particularly in the presence of iMCT1, showed a
high level of sensitivity to phenformin, which is consistent
with ATP crisis or “metabolic catastrophe”, as discussed
recently [8] and reported for colon adenocarcinoma and
glioblastoma cells [19] (Fig. 6 A,B).
Only the BSG-null tumours were sensitive to
phenformin (Fig. 7). The fact that parental cells were
totally insensitive to phenformin, which contrasted
with the in vitro data, may suggest that the tumour cells
were exposed to a hypoxic microenvironment favouring
glycolysis and /or production of a low level of ROS.
Another explanation for the attenuated sensitivity to
phenformin in vivo in both parental and BSG-null cells is
that the concentration of phenformin delivered in vivo was
lower than the concentration of 50μM used in vitro.
Moreover, Shackelford and co-workers showed

Upregulation of glycolysis and adaptation to
acidosis are key events in the transition from in situ to
invasive cancer [11].MCTs may play an important role
through their involvement in exporting lactic acid [10].
MCTs have been described to be upregulated in several
cancers [25]. However, expression in lung cancer is
still controversial [16, 20, 27]. In the present study,
we showed that MCTs are upregulated in lung tumour
tissue when compared to adjacent non-tumour tissue.
Moreover, we detected MCT1 and MCT4 in the plasma
membrane of all the histological types studied. These
results were in accordance with those of Koukourakis
and co-workers [16]. However, they did not describe the
cellular localization and histological type of the samples
stained for MCT. Interestingly, we found that MCT1
and MCT4 were overexpressed in the squamous cell
carcinoma subtype and MCT4 was overexpressed in all
cases of adenocarcinoma subtypes, suggesting a different
expression pattern of the histological types. However,
due to the small number of cases, this study should be
extended and replicated to obtain more solid statistically
relevant data.
To understand the biological role of MCTs, we
developed a strategy to inhibit their activity in a lung
carcinoma cell line. For MCT1, we used the specific
MCT1/2 inhibitor (AR-C155858; AstraZeneca) and found
that it did not affect in vitro cell growth in either normoxia
or hypoxia. In normoxia, A549 cells relied mainly on
OXPHOS rather than on glycolysis [39], thus inhibiting
MCT1, even with low expression of MCT4, did not
affect cell clonogenicity. In hypoxia, in which OXPHOS
was reduced and glycolysis enhanced, cells were able
to survive and proliferate due to the presence of HIF-1induced MCT4. Although, regulation of MCT expression
is still not fully understood, one of the best characterized
mechanisms of MCT regulation occurs through coexpression with BSG. As no pharmacological inhibitor of
MCT4 is yet available and as previous published results
[17] showed that the major pro-tumour action of BSG is
mediated through bioenergetics, namely by controlling
lactate transport, we decided to knockdown both MCT4
and BSG. As shRNA targeting of MCT4 and BSG failed
to completely stop the growth of A549 cells in hypoxia,
we decided to disrupt the BSG gene. We observed that
KO of BSG resulted in a decrease in MCT1 and MCT4
expression. We observed that the mRNA level remained
unchanged for MCT1 but increased 2-fold for MCT4
in the absence of BSG. As we previously reported for
the LS174 colon cell line [17], BSG KO did not affect
expression of MCTs at the transcriptional/translational
levels but severely reduced the trafficking of MCTs from
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane
[15]. In the absence of the chaperone (BSG), MCT1 and
MCT4 were very unstable in the ER, which explained their

that inactivation of the suppressor gene LKB1 dictated a
therapeutic response of NSCLC to phenformin [6, 32]. In
this context, they showed that cells with mutated LKB1
(as in A549 cells) were more sensitive to phenformin
and that this effect was dependent on AMPK activation.
They hypothesized that without phosphorylation of
AMPK through LKB1, these cells lacked the mitophagy
induced by the protein ULK1, a downstream target of
AMPK. Thus cells accumulated defective mitochondria
and did not neutralize ROS that induced apoptosis.
This is an interesting explanation, however our studies
contradict this explanation since we found a high
sensitivity to phenformin independently of the LKB1
status. We propose instead that the level of sensitivity to
phenformin is dictated by the glycolytic rate. In normoxia,
the cell line with the lowest glycolytic rate (A549) was
the most sensitive. A decrease in glycolysis by BSG
disruption rendered the three cell lines equally sensitive to
phenformin in normoxia and hypoxia.
In vitro studies of cells cultured in monolayers have
given information about cell-autonomous metabolism,
however they do not reflect the real physiological
microenvironment in tumours. In vivo studies showed that
BSG disruption did not reduce tumour growth as shown
by other groups [4, 33]. In fact, tumour growth increased
approximately 4-fold for BSG-/- cells compared to wt
cells. These results could reflect a clonal growth effect.
However, in vitro studies showed that these KO cells had
the same proliferation rate as wt cells. In addition we
observed that phenformin drastically inhibited tumour
growth, with a stronger impact on BSG-/- cells compared
to wt cells.

of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Incubation in hypoxia was carried out
at 1% oxygen.

Immunohistochemistry
Sections
of
3-μm
were
used
for
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. IHC for MCT1
and CD147/BASIGIN was performed according to the
avidin-biotin-peroxidase methodology (R.T.U. Vectastin
Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories Inc.), as previously
described by our group [26]. MCT4 IHC was performed
with the Ultravision Detection System Anti-polyvalent,
HRP (Lab Vision Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
as previously described [21, 28]. In brief, paraffin
embedded sections were deparaffinized in xylene and
hydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions. For
antigen retrieval, slides were incubated either with 1mM
EDTA buffered solution, pH 8.0 (CD147) or citrate
buffer, pH=6.0 (MCT1, MCT4) for 20 min in a water
bath at 98°C. After endogenous peroxidase inactivation,
incubation with the primary antibody was performed
overnight for MCT1 and CD147 and for 2 h for MCT4 at
room temperature. Tissues were stained with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB+ Substrate System, DakoCytomation,
Dako, Agilent Technologies Company) and counterstained
with haematoxylin. Colon carcinoma tissue was used as a
positive control for MCT1, MCT4 and CD147. Stained
slides were evaluated and then photographed under a
bright field microscope. Sections were scored for plasma
membrane expression following a semi-quantitative
criterion. The score used was the sum of the percentage of
positive cells (0, negative; 1, less than 5% positive cells; 2,
25% to 50% positive cells; and 3, more than 50% positive
cells) and the staining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2,
moderate; 3, strong). Scores between 0 to 3 were classified
as negative and 4 to 6 as positive [26].

Conclusion
The results obtained by inhibiting the MCTs/
BSG complex are promising. Nevertheless, we do not
yet assume that MCTs are effective targets for cancer
therapy. More effort is needed to prove that inhibition of
metabolism, more specifically lactate transport, may be an
alternative therapeutic strategy to use in the treatment of
certain types of cancer. Therefore, the present work is an
attempt to provide new data supporting the exploitation of
MCTs/BSG as targets in lung cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Tissue samples
Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
samples from primary lung tumour tissues were retrieved
from the archives of the Department of Pathology of
Hospital S. João, Porto, Portugal. The tumours were
classified according to the WHO criteria [36]. This

Nucleases (ZFNs)

50329, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and for MCT1 (1:
3000; rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal
last 15 residues, prepared in the laboratory). The
polyclonal antibody to arrest-defective-1 protein (ARD1)
was used as loading control (1:30000). Bands were
detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences)
after incubation of blots with secondary anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit antibodies (Promega) coupled to horseradish
peroxidase.

To generate A549, H1975 and H292 KO cells for
BASIGIN, two ZFN plasmids (designed by Sigma-Aldrich
CKOZFN1227-1KT, CompoZr Custom ZFN) targeting
BASIGIN exon 2 were transfected using JetPRIME®
Transfection Reagent (Polyplus-transfection SA),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected
cells were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), with a CD147 (MAB972, R&D Systems) primary
antibody and with a PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (115115-164, Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibody.
Negative cells for BSG were selected, sorted and cloned
by dilution in 96 wells. The absence of BSG expression
was confirmed by immunoblotting and only clones lacking
the two alleles of BSG were analysed.

Clonogenicity assay
A549 and H1975 wt and BSG-/- cells (2x103) were
seeded in 60-mm dishes and incubated for 24h to adhere.
Medium was replaced with DMEM 10% FCS with and
without iMCT1/2 AR-C155858 (300nM) or Phenformin
(50M) or both for 10 days in normoxia and 15 days in
hypoxia (1% O2). Dishes were stained with 5% Giemsa
(Fluka) for 45min to visualize colonies.

[14C]-lactate uptake

Metabolic analysis

[14C]-lactate uptake was measured to determine
lactate transport in A549 cells, as previously published
[17]. The protein concentration was determined to
normalize the radioactivity to the protein content of the
cells in each dish. [14C]-L-lactate uptake was expressed as
counts per million per mg of protein.

The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and
the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were measured
with a Seahorse XF analyser (Seahorse Bioscience, MA,
USA). A549 cells (8x104) and H1975 cells (1x105) were
seeded on seahorse plates and allowed to grow for 24h in
normoxia. Prior to measurement, Plates were incubated
for 45min in a non-CO2 incubator at 37°C with seahorse
medium without glucose, pyruvate, serum or bicarbonate.
10mM of glucose (Sigma), 300nM of iMCT1/2
(AstraZeneca, UK), 50μM of phenformin (Sigma) and
1μM of oligomycin (Sigma) were injected. After each
addition, three data points of 3min were undertaken to
determine the oxygen and proton concentrations in the
medium. The protein concentration was determined to
normalize OCR and ECAR values.

Intracellular lactate assay
A549 and H1975 cells (3x105) were seeded in
12-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. After
incubation in hypoxia (1% O2) for 24h, cells were washed
twice and maintained in DMEM without glucose, pyruvate
and serum for 1h with either DMSO or iMCT1/2 (300nM).
DMEM 5% FCS with either DMSO or iMCT1/2 was
added and cells were collected at the indicated times (0,
1, 3 and 6h). For determination of the intracellular lactate
concentration, cells were washed once with cold PBS1x
and cold water and lysed with 200μL cold water. 50μL
of cell lysate was assayed in 96-well plates in triplicate
to measure the lactate concentration using a lactate
colorimetric assay kit (K607-100, Biovision Incorporated).

Tumour xenografts
Immunodeficient female nude mice with
approximately 22g body weight were housed in groups
of five, under specific pathogen-free, controlled ambient
conditions. Animal studies were conducted according to
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique institutional
guidelines (Ciepal n° NCE/-165). A549 wt and BSG-/- cells
(2x106/mouse) suspended in 300μL of serum-free DMEM
supplemented with insulin-transferrin-selenium (Gibco,
Life Technologies Corporation) were sub-cutaneously
injected into the backs of the mice. Water containing 5%
sucrose with and without 200mg/Kg phenformin (Sigma
Aldrich) was added to the drinking water, and the daily
intake fluids were monitored. Sucrose was added to
make the drinking water palatable (MVCL Appleyard

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in 1.5x SDS sample buffer and
incubated for 15min at 95°C. Protein concentrations were
determined using the BCA Assay. 40μg of protein was
separated on 8% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore).
Blots were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TN buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and incubated
overnight with the primary antibodies for CD147/BSG
(1:500; MAB972, R&D Systems), MCT4 (1:1000; SCwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

et al. 2012). Fresh phenformin was administered every
two days. Tumours were measured every 2–3 days using
a calliper and the volume was determined by using the
formula: (4π/3) × L/2 × W/2 × H/2, where L represents
length, W the width, and H the height. Tumours were
harvested at approximately 1 cm3, fixed and paraffinembedded.
