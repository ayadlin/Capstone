Abstract
Recent clinical trials in cancer therapy have demonstrated unprecedented responses through
blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 immune checkpoint pathways. In a provocative recent paper in
Science Translational Medicine, Hatfield and colleagues demonstrate the ability of supplemental
oxygen to act as a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor by disrupting the hypoxia-adenosine-A2aR
pathway.

Recent clinical successes of immunotherapy for cancer support a model whereby T cell
responses are generated against tumor antigens only to be thwarted by negative regulatory
mechanisms that comprise the tumor microenvironment (Postow et al., 2015). Indeed, it is
clear that, for some patients, checkpoint blockade directed against PD-1 and CTLA-4 is able
to unleash T cells capable of promoting durable tumor regression. Recently, Hatfield et al.
(2015) presented data accentuating the role of the hypoxia-adenosine-A2aR axis as a
checkpoint in thwarting anti-tumor immune responses. For checkpoint blockade, they
employ oxygen.

Over the past two decades, a multitude of studies have demonstrated the critical role of
extracellular adenosine as an immunoregulatory agent to prevent the development of overexuberant immune responses (Young et al., 2014). As an immune response develops, against
pathogenic invasion for example, increased cellular turnover and hypoxia promote the
production and release of large amounts of adenosine into the local microenvironment
(Figure 1). Signaling through the A2a and A2b adenosine receptors (receptors that are
broadly expressed on immune cells), adenosine triggers a pleiotropic cascade of
immunosuppressive effects, dampening the inflammatory response and protecting
surrounding tissues from immune-mediated damage. Increasing hypoxia in inflamed tissues
triggers the accumulation of adenosine by depleting intracellular ATP, increasing
intracellular AMP, increasing expression of 5′-nucleotidase, and, through hypoxia-inducible
factor-1α (HIF-1α) activity, inhibiting adenosine kinase activity (Decking et al., 1997;
Sitkovsky, 2009). The increased activity of HIF-1α in hypoxic conditions also drives the

expression of the CD73 and CD39 transmembrane ectonucleotidases that work in tandem to
degrade extracellular ATP to adenosine (Young et al., 2014). As the adenosine concentration
increases in the extracellular environment, increased signaling through Gs-protein-coupled
receptors (A2a and A2b) produces an elevation in intracellular cAMP, ultimately
suppressing the release of inflammatory mediators and enhancing the expression of
immunosuppressive factors.

In their article recently published in Science Translational Medicine, Hatfield et al. (2015)
not only hypothesized that the hypoxia-adenosine-A2aR axis was acting as a “checkpoint”
to inhibit anti-tumor immunity, but, more provocatively, that they could overcome this
inhibition by using supplemental oxygen to produce hyperoxia in mice. To this end, multiple
pulmonary tumors were established by the intravenous injection of B16 melanoma or
MCA205 fibrosarcoma tumor cells. By simply allowing mice to breath 60% oxygen, they
were able to demonstrate a marked decrease in tumor size as well as a marked increase in
overall survival when compared to mice breathing ambient air. Notably, the anti-tumor
responses were completely abrogated in γc/Rag-2−/− mice that are deficient in T and NK
cells, thus demonstrating the requirement of immune effector cells to enact the antitumor
response. With the use of monoclonal antibodies to deplete CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells, they
demonstrated further that, while the effect of hyperoxic breathing on tumor regression was
greatly attenuated in the absence of CD4+ and CD8 T+ cells, the effect was completely
abrogated after the depletion of the NK cell population. Importantly, the authors also
showed that, in contrast to wild-type mice, hyperoxia had no detectable effect on enhancing
anti-tumor immunity further in A2aR null mice. This latter finding implicates a role for the
A2aR in mediating the hypoxia-induced immunosuppression. Lastly, administration of a
reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger had no effect on the tumor response, indicating
that ROS and related cytotoxicity did not play a meaningful role in the observed tumor
response.

Interestingly, altering the oxygen tension of the tumor microenvironment also had an effect
on T cell trafficking. First, through immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue sections,
the authors were able to demonstrate that CD8+ T cells preferentially localized to nonhypoxic regions within a particular tumor. Second, by using an in vivo marker of hypoxia,
they demonstrated that hyperoxic respiration decreases CD8+ and CD4+ T cell exposure to
hypoxic microenvironments. Third, the authors observed a dramatic increase in recruitment
of CD8+ T cells to established MCA205 tumors in the setting of hyperoxic breathing.
Importantly, when evaluated for CD69 and CD44 expression by flow cytometry, these CD8+
T cells were significantly more highly activated than those isolated from mice exposed only
to ambient O2. The increased CD8+ T cell trafficking was supported by the change in
expression of over 50 cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors. These findings were
extended by showing that the number of adoptively transferred, CFSE-labeled T cells that
traffic to established tumors was 3-fold higher per unit area in mice undergoing hyperoxic
respiration than control mice. Furthermore, hyperoxia resulted in a decrease in the
percentage of T regulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment, decrease in Foxp3
expression, decrease in CD39 and CD73 expression on the T regulatory cells, as well as a
decrease in the expression of CTLA-4 on the T regulatory cells. While it is thought that

tumor infiltrating T regulatory cells easily adapt to the tumor microenvironment, it appeared
as though altering the oxygen tension in the tumor disrupted this adaptive process.

Overall, these studies have potentially important implications for the further development of
immunotherapy for cancer. First, they confirm and provide insightful details concerning the
role of hypoxia, adenosine, and the A2aR in inhibiting anti-tumor immune responses. To
this end, these findings support the development of A2aR antagonists and CD73 inhibitors
as novel agents to enhance immunotherapy. Second, these observations immediately lend
themselves to devising novel and synergistic clinical approaches. The simplicity of oxygen
therapy as a means of enhancing immunotherapy is appealing. Yes, persistent hyperoxia can
lead to tissue damage both in the lungs and liver (Kallet and Matthay, 2013; Zangl et al.,
2014). Thus, reproducing these findings in humans in a way that limits hyperoxia-induced
injury will be challenging. However, one can imagine sequencing oxygen therapy with antiPD-1, anti-CTLA-4, or even A2aR blockade as a means of making the tumor
microenvironment more hospitable for immune-mediated tumor destruction. As higher
populations of intratumoral CD8+ cells have been correlated to better clinical responses to
PD-1 checkpoint blockade (Tumeh et al., 2014), the observation that hyperoxia can increase
CD8+ T cells and decrease Foxp3+ T regulatory T cells within the tumor portends well for
combining oxygen and other modalities. Along these lines, given the pivotal role of oxygen
in regulating both tumor and immune cell metabolism and function (Palazon et al., 2014;
Zeng et al., 2015), increasing the oxygen tension within the tumor microenvironment might
prove to be a simple means of simultaneously dampening multiple immune regulatory
checkpoints.

Figure 1. The Hypoxia-Adenosinergic Pathway in Immune Regulation

Partially through stabilization of HIF-1α, hypoxia in inflamed and cancerous tissues drives
the intracellular accumulation of adenosine by causing decreased ATP and adenosine kinase
(AK) activity as well as increasing intracellular AMP and 5′-nucleotidase activity (5′N).
Additionally, HIF-1α activity drives increased expression of the 5′-ectonucleotidases CD39
and CD73, which are transmembrane proteins that catalyze the enzymatic breakdown of
ATP to adenosine. Both of these mechanisms lead to significant elevation of extracellular
adenosine concentrations in the microenvironment. Signaling through two Gs-protein-

coupled adenosine receptors (A2aR and A2bR), adenosine triggers an increase in the
intracellular signaling molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP). Within immune effector cells such as
cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, cAMP causes a buildup of a range of immunosuppressive
factors (TGF-β, IL-10, CTLA-4, PD-1, Galectin-1, FoxP3), as well as the down-regulation
of key effector molecules (IL-2, INF-γ, TNF-α, perforin, IL-12, MIP1α) involved in an
