Abstract
Next generation sequencing has shown the frequent occurrence of point
mutations in the ubiquitin E3 ligase c-Cbl in myeloid malignancies. Mouse models
revealed a causal contribution of c-Cbl for the onset of such neoplasms. The point
mutations typically cluster in the linker region and RING finger domain and affect both
alleles by acquired uniparental disomy. The fast progress in the detection of c-Cbl
mutations is contrasted by our scarce knowledge on their functional consequences.
The c-Cbl protein displays several enzymatic functions by promoting the attachment
of differentially composed ubiquitin chains and of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to
its target proteins. In addition, c-Cbl functions as an adapter protein and undergoes
phosphorylation-dependent inducible conformation changes. Studies on the impact
of c-Cbl mutations on its functions as a dynamic and versatile adapter protein, its
interactomes and on its various enzymatic activities are now important to allow the
identification of druggable targets within the c-Cbl signaling network.

Introduction

which have lost the ability to self-renew, but still maintain
full-lineage differentiation potential [3]. MPPs can
differentiate into common myeloid progenitors (CMPs),
leading eventually to the generation of the myeloid lineage
[2, 4-8].
Some myeloid malignancies are characterized by
prominent and characteristic disease-causing mutations.
For example, the vast majority of Polycythemia vera
patients carry gain-of function mutations in Janus
kinase 2 (JAK2 V617F) [9], while a hallmark of chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) is the generation of BCRABL fusion proteins [10]. On the other hand, two thirds
of patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative
neoplasms (MDS/MPN) have a normal karyotype, but
have several oncogenic mutations in a variety of genes
encoding proteins involved in RNA splicing, chromatin
modification, transcription or signaling [11]. A substantial
fraction of MDS/MPN and their subtypes is characterized
by the frequent occurrence of mutations in the gene
encoding c-Cbl (Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma), a protein
whose various enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions are
now beginning to emerge.

Myeloid malignancies comprise three broad
categories: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
characterized by accumulation of immature myeloid cells
in the bone marrow, myelodypastic syndromes (MDS)
associated with ineffective hematopoiesis and chronic
myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), usually associated
with an increased production of terminally differentiated
myeloid cells. Despite this heterogeneity, all myeloid
malignancies originate from progenitors that normally
give rise to terminally differentiated cells of the myeloid
series. Genetic and epigenetic events occurring early in
hematopoietic stem cell maturation can lead to myeloid
malignancies. Mutations can disrupt the normal course
of hematopoiesis, resulting in a wide range of defects
affecting the myeloid lineages [1].
Normal hematopoiesis involves a strict hierarchy
of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The single primary
source for the entire mammalian blood system is the
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), which is both multipotent
and self-renewing in the absence of differentiation [2].
HSCs initially give rise to multipotent progenitors (MPPs),

Architecture and function of c-Cbl proteins

23]. The dual function of c-Cbl as an enzyme and as an
adapter protein is schematically displayed in Figure 2.
Given the multiplicity of interaction partners and its
various enzymatic functions it is not surprising that Cbl
proteins affect signaling pathways involved in a wide
range of processes, including the immune response,
endocytic sorting, apoptosis and autophagy [24-26].
Single nucleotide polymorphism screens and sequencing
showed that myeloproliferative neoplasms frequently
show mutations in c-Cbl, but not in the other members
of the Cbl family [27-29]. While mutations of c-Cbl are
frequently discovered in myeloid neoplasms, mutations of
the other Cbl family members, Cbl-b and Cbl-c, are hardly
detected [30]. So far only five mutations within the RING
finger domain of Cbl-b were reported, which likely disrupt
its function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase [31, 32].

The attachment of ubiquitin to its client proteins
regulates many different biological processes and occurs
by a complex enzymatic cascade [12]. This process is
critically dependent on ubiquitin activation by the E1
enzymes, followed by transfer of the activated ubiquitin
to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and finally,
conjugation of ubiquitin to the target protein by an
ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). The E3 family of ubiquitinprotein ligases has a crucial role in substrate recognition
and is of great importance in the (patho)physiology of
intracellular signaling networks [13, 14]. Among E3
ligases, the small family of Cbl ubiquitin E3 ligases
consists of the ubiquitously expressed proteins c-Cbl and
Cbl-b as well as Cbl-c, which occur primarily in epithelial
cells. All Cbl proteins share an N-terminal tyrosine-kinasebinding (TKB) domain that is followed by a RING (really
interesting new gene) finger and a proline-rich domain
[15]. The TKB domain is a modified SH2 (Src homology
2) domain that allows binding to phosphorylated tyrosines
typically found in Cbl-interacting proteins. Cbl proteins
are activated by phosphorylation at Y371 located in a
linker region between the RING finger and the TKB
domain [16]. This phosphorylation releases Cbl from its
autoinhibited structure by triggering a conformational
change that results in increased binding of the ubiquitin
conjugating protein (or E2) to the RING finger of Cbl.
This in turn leads to an enhanced transfer of ubiquitin
from the E2 enzyme to the substrate proteins [17, 18]. The
C-termini of Cbl-b and c-Cbl harbor extended proline-rich
sequences and also a domain involved in ubiquitin binding
and dimerization [19]. These domains allow for regulated
protein/protein interactions via inducible association
with SH2 and SH3 (Src homology 3) domain-containing
proteins, as schematically displayed in Figure 1.
Cbl proteins can exert multiple enzymatic functions.
They can attach K48-branched polyubiquitin chains,
resulting in proteasomal degradation of the decorated
client proteins [20]. Cbl E3 ligases can also mediate the
attachment of either K63-conjugated ubiquitin chains or
single ubiquitin molecules to their substrate proteins to
mediate non-proteolytic regulatory functions [21]. Recent
evidence shows that c-Cbl also has the ability to mediate
attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (neural
precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated
8) to substrate proteins. It was shown that c-Cbl-mediated
neddylation of the TGF-Î² type II receptor antagonizes
its ubiquitination and degradation [22]. Currently, it
is not clear what molecular events guide Cbl proteins
to distinguish between these four distinct enzymatic
functions.
In addition to these enzymatic activities, the various
domains in Cbl proteins enable its function as an adapter
by allowing constitutive or phososphorylation-dependent
association with a plethora of different proteins [15,

c-Cbl mutations in myelodysplastic
myeloproliferative neoplasms

and

Although approximately 10% of myeloid neoplasms
show c-Cbl mutations, their frequency varies considerably
between the subtypes. For example, while de novo AML
has a relatively low frequency of such mutations at around
1-3%, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)
and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) have
the highest frequencies of c-Cbl mutations of around
13-15% [33-35]. Mutations in c-Cbl are typically
nucleotide substitutions or small insertions/deletions
that are heavily enriched in exons 8 and 9 and occur in
the linker or RING finger domain of c-Cbl [27, 28, 36,
37]. Approximately 85% of the mutations are point
mutations and approximately 15% are small deletions of
the linker and RING finger regions. Approximately 10%
of patients with MDS/MPN show c-Cbl mutations and
frequently display clinical features such as splenomegaly,
monocytosis and anemia [38]. Of the point mutations,
about 70% are homozygous due to acquired uniparental
disomy (aUPD), where both copies of a chromosome
pair or parts of chromosomes have originated from one
parent. Thus aUPD is a mechanism by which pathogenetic
mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity.
Thus, an allelic conversion of the 11q arms leads to
duplication of the mutated parental copy of 11q and loss
of the remaining wild-type allele, resulting in homozygous
c-Cbl mutations [36]. These mutations frequently result
in the loss of ubiquitin E3 ligase activity [36], thus
prohibiting lysosomal or ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated
degradation of tyrosine kinases and thereby unleashing
tyrosine kinase signaling. Therefore, although these
mutations cause biochemical loss-of-function of c-Cbl,
their functional consequences resemble classical gain-offunction mutations.

Mechanisms of c-Cbl mediated oncogenic
transformation

secondary driver mutations is recapitulated in an animal
model where transgenic mice expressing the oncogenic
fusion protein NHD13 (NUP98-HOXD13) develop a
myelodysplastic syndrome, which proceeds to acute
leukemia. These animals pick up several secondary driver
mutations in several genes including c-Cbl [44]. A deep
sequencing study performed with a cell colony derived
from a single cell detected ten mutations, compatible with
the concept of a linear evolution of a dominant clone [34].
Recent advances in single cell genomics will now enable
a detailed view into the stepwise acquisition of primary
and secondary driver mutations [45]. It was suggested that
c-Cbl mutations might indicate a poor clinical prognosis
[38], but this is not consistently seen in other studies
[46, 47]. It will be therefore important to consider also
the prognostic value of these co-occurring secondary
mutations in the future.
The importance of c-Cbl to myeloid differentiation
and cancer is likely due to its involvement in numerous
signaling pathways and biological functions. Mutation of
c-Cbl can lead to aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT
and PI3K-AKT pathways to transmit mitogenic and/or
survival signals [48-50]. The mutant c-Cbl protein can
also affect cytoskeleton organization via activation of
Rac1 or Cdc42, and R-RAS [51] and affects integrinmediated cell adhesion, spreading, and migration [52,
53]. Cbl proteins are important for the control of signaling
thresholds in immune cells, and point mutations of c-Cbl
consistently lead to enhanced granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-triggered signaling
via STAT5 and JAK2 [54, 55].
Cbl also contributes to myeloid differentiation by
regulating the activity of colony stimulating factor-1
(CSF-1) receptor (CSF-1R). In the hematopoietic
system, CSF-1 is believed to act specifically on myeloid
progenitors, starting from the CMP stage, and to favour the
differentiation of CMPs into the monocyte/macrophage
lineage [56]. Indeed, transgenic mice engineered to
secrete human CSF-1 show augmented frequencies and
functions of human myeloid cells [57]. CSF-1 can directly
induce the myeloid master regulator PU.1 and thus instruct
myeloid cell-fate change in mouse HSCs both in vitro and
in vivo [58]. Furthermore, intra-hepatic transfer of human
fetal liver derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
(CD34+) in humanized CSF-1 newborn mice resulted in
more efficient differentiation and enhanced frequencies
of human monocytes/macrophages in the bone marrow,
spleens, peripheral blood, lungs, liver and peritoneal
cavity, pointing to its potential role in myeloid cell fate
[57]. The magnitude and duration of signaling through
activated CSF-1R is tightly regulated by its c-Cbl mediated
ubiquitination-dependent down-regulation [59-61]. These
c-Cbl-mediated effects on soluble factors such as CSF-1
raise the intriguing possibility that an oncogenic mutation
in one tumor cell might affect neighbouring wildtype cells
by paracrine mechanisms.

The causal contribution of c-Cbl to the onset of
myeloid malignancies was revealed in mouse models.
c-Cbl-deficient mice are viable but show lymphoid
hyperplasia, enhanced T-cell signaling and primary
splenic extramedullary hemopoiesis [39]. In contrast,
mice lacking Cbl-b do not share phenotypes with c-Cblnull mice and are characterized by a reduced T-cell
activation threshold. Mice with combined deletion of
c-Cbl and Cbl-b in hematopoietic stem cells develop an
early-onset lethal myeloproliferative disease within the
first months after birth [40]. Mice engineered to express
a c-Cbl RING domain point mutation (C379A) develop
a myeloproliferative disease that progresses to leukemia
[41], thus classifying c-Cbl mutations as driver mutations.
This phenotype is even more severe than that of c-Cbldeficient mice, suggesting that c-Cbl mutations act in
a dominant negative manner and also affect the other
endogenous members of the Cbl family. In addition
to its function as a dominant negative protein mutant
c-Cbl may also act as a positive signaling protein via its
adaptor function. While a single c-Cbl point mutation
can cause myeloid malignancies in mice, the situation is
markedly different in humans. This difference is unlikely
to be attributable to differences in expression levels or
other experimental settings, as in humans over 10%
of the tumors carry c-Cbl mutations together with 2-4
additional characteristic mutations [11, 37]. Furthermore,
mutations at amino-acid residue C381 in human c-Cbl
(equivalent to amino-acid residue C379 in mouse c-Cbl)
amounts to ~0.8% of the mutations identified. The relative
contribution of c-Cbl to development of MDS/MPN might
be underestimated because some other genes known to be
mutated or amplified in MDS/MPN, such as the duplicated
gene encoding the SH3KBP1 (SH3-domain kinase binding
protein) adapter protein, are part of the c-Cbl-regulated
signaling network and may have the same effect as a c-Cbl
mutation [42]. In addition, inactivation of c-Cbl may be
mediated by events that do not affect the c-Cbl sequence.
Phosphatases may keep c-Cbl in an inactivated state
and increased auto-ubiquitination can limit the available
protein amounts of the E3 ligase in tumor cells. Novel
proteogenomic approaches for characterization of tumor
cells will enable completely new insights in the relative
protein abundance of c-Cbl and its client proteins [43]. In
humans, c-Cbl mutations are not typical founding driver
mutations allowing the first step in the leukemogenic
process, but rather occur as subclonal secondary driver
mutations, ensuring the further progress of the disease.
Support for this model comes from the analysis of a
patient with essential thrombocythemia, who had an intact
c-Cbl gene at the early stage of disease, but acquired a
c-Cbl R420Q mutation during disease progression to
myelofibrosis [29]. The concept of c-Cbl mutations as

Accumulating clinical evidence shows that
progression mutations in c-Cbl and other key regulators
occur during further clonal development of myeloid
malignancies. Unlike the classical gain-of-function
mutations exemplified by constitutive active JAK2
(V617F) or BCR-ABL [62], mutant c-Cbl has lost its
enzymatic activity which renders it not an obvious
drug target. This raises the need to identify druggable
downstream components of the c-Cbl signaling pathways.
Therefore, the downstream effectors of c-Cbl such as the
JAK/STAT, PI3K, and ERK signaling pathways have been
suggested as potential therapeutic targets. However, drugs
acting on these signaling endpoints will not be specific
for myeloid malignancies. As mutant c-Cbl proteins
could display residual enzymatic activities as E3 ligases it
may also be feasible to inhibit deubiquitinating enzymes
that counteract c-Cbl. In order to develop drugs that are
specifically tailored for the treatment of myeloid tumors
with c-Cbl mutations we need a better understanding
of the functional consequences of these mutations.
The importance of this concept has been demonstrated
by the use of mice with a c-Cbl RING finger mutation
that develop a myeloproliferative disease progressing
to leukemia. These mice exhibit augmented FLT3 (fmsrelated tyrosine kinase 3) signaling and inhibition of
FLT3 kinase activity by quizartinib (AC220) effectively
suppresses MPD development [41]. Deciphering how
individual c-Cbl mutations affect its different enzymatic
functions (neddylation, monoubiquitination, regulatory or
proteolytic polyubiquitination) will provide therapeutic
clues. As the activity of c-Cbl proteins is regulated by
conformational changes [17, 18], it will be important
to determine changes in the interactomes between
wildtype and oncogenically mutated proteins. Also
the intracellular localization of mutant c-Cbl and its
posttranslational modifications need to be investigated,
as phosphorylation of Y700 enables the interaction
with further signal transmitting enzymes such as Vav1
[63], while phosphorylation at Y731 and Y774 allows
binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K and the Crk-family
of adapter proteins, respectively [48, 64]. Along this
line, a comparative analysis of phosphoproteomes in
cells expressing wildtype or mutant c-Cbl would help
in the exploration of deregulated signaling pathways.
New genetic tools such as inducibly expressed shRNAs
or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing will
enable synthetic lethality screens to identify druggable
interactions between mutant c-Cbl and further components
of the signaling network.
