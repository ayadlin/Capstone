BACKGROUND: 3-Bromopyruvate is an alkylating agent with antitumor activity. It is currently believed that
blockade of adenosine triphosphate production from glycolysis and mitochondria is the primary
mechanism responsible for this antitumor effect. The current studies uncovered a new and novel
mechanism for the antitumor activity of 3-bromopyruvate. METHODS: The transport of 3-bromopyruvate
by sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SMCT1 (SLC5A8), a tumor suppressor and a sodium
(Naþ)-coupled, electrogenic transporter for short-chain monocarboxylates, was studied using a mammalian
cell expression and the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression systems. The effect of 3-bromopyruvate on
histone deacetylases (HDACs) was monitored using the lysate of the human breast cancer cell line MCF7
and human recombinant HDAC isoforms as the enzyme sources. Cell viability was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis and colony-formation assay. The acetylation status of histone H4 was
evaluated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: 3-Bromopyruvate is a transportable substrate for SLC5A8,
and that transport process is Naþ-coupled and electrogenic. MCF7 cells did not express SLC5A8 and were
not affected by 3-bromopyruvate. However, when transfected with SLC5A8 or treated with inhibitors of
DNA methylation, these cells underwent apoptosis in the presence of 3-bromopyruvate. This cell death was
associated with the inhibition of HDAC1/HDAC3. Studies with different isoforms of human recombinant
HDACs identified HDAC1 and HDAC3 as the targets for 3-bromopyruvate. CONCLUSIONS: 3-Bromopyruvate was transported into cells actively through the tumor suppressor SLC5A8, and the process was
energized by an electrochemical Naþ gradient. Ectopic expression of the transporter in MCF7 cells led to
apoptosis, and the mechanism involved the inhibition of HDAC1/HDAC3. Cancer 2009;115:4655–66.

Tumor cells are unique in that they derive most of
their metabolic energy from glycolysis rather than from
oxidative phosphorylation.1-6 Because glycolysis itself
generates only 2 mol of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per
glucose, whereas oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria generates 30 mol of ATP per glucose, tumor
cells have to up-regulate glycolysis 20-fold to 30-fold to
meet their energy requirements. This is achieved by several means. Glucose entry into tumor cells is enhanced,
expression of most of the enzymes involved in glycolysis is
up-regulated, and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes are
expressed differentially such that pyruvate effectively is
converted into lactate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is regenerated to maintain the optimal activity of
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.7 In normal
cells, the conversion of pyruvate into lactate is facilitated
only when the oxygen supply becomes limited; whereas,
in tumor cells, this process occurs in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation
to glycolysis in tumor cells as the primary source of ATP
underlies the Warburg hypothesis, which states that tumor cells exhibit elevated levels of glycolysis in the presence of oxygen.8
Because tumor cells rely heavily on glycolysis for
ATP production, inhibition of this metabolic pathway
provides a logical target for cancer treatment. With this rationale, 3-bromopyruvate was developed as a potential
antitumor agent.9,10 Because it is a potent alkylating
agent, 3-bromopyruvate has several molecular targets.
The most important among them that is relevant to tumor
cell metabolism is hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. Hexokinase II, 1 of the 4 isoforms of the
enzyme, is expressed at very low levels in most normal cells
but is up-regulated several-fold in tumor cells.11 This
enzyme is inactivated by 3-bromopyruvate, resulting in
the blockade of the first step in glycolysis. 3-Bromopyruvate also inhibits pyruvate kinase, which catalyzes the
conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate.12 In
addition, 3-bromopyruvate enters the mitochondria,
inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, and prevents mitochondrial ATP production.11 Currently, it is believed that
the blockade of energy production is the primary mechanism for the antitumor activity of 3-bromopyruvate.5,10,11

The antitumor activity of 3-bromopyruvate has been
demonstrated in several models of cancer.13-17
Recently, a plasma membrane transporter known as
sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)
SMCT1 (SLC5A8), has been identified as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer.18,19 The transporter is expressed in normal colon but is silenced in colon cancer through DNA
methylation. It is a sodium (Naþ)-coupled, electrogenic
transporter for short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate; for other monocarboxylates, such as lactate and pyruvate20-22; and for the B-complex vitamin
nicotinate.23,24 The ability of SLC5A8 to transport butyrate,
a bacterial fermentation product and an inhibitor of histone
deacetylases (HDACs), underlies its tumor-suppressive effect
in the colon.25,26 Surprisingly, the transporter is silenced not
only in colon cancer but also in tumors of a variety of noncolonic tisues.19 Butyrate is not relevant to any of these tissues. Therefore, it was puzzling why the transporter is
silenced in these tumors. Our recent studies have provided a
likely mechanism for this phenomenon.27,28 Pyruvate, a
ubiquitous metabolite, is a substrate for SLC5A8 and is as
potent as butyrate as an HDAC inhibitor. Pyruvate and butyrate specifically inhibit HDAC1 and HDAC3, 2 isoenzymes that are up-regulated in cancer. The ability of
SLC5A8 to transport pyruvate actively into cells with resultant intracellular inhibition of HDAC1/HDAC3 underlies
the tumor-suppressive effect of the transporter in noncolonic
tissues. 3-Bromopyruvate is related structurally to pyruvate.
Therefore, we asked whether SLC5A8 and HDAC1/
HDAC3 play any role in the tumor-suppressive effect of 3bromopyruvate. In the current study, we demonstrate that
3-bromopyruvate indeed is a transportable substrate for
SLC5A8 and that it is a potent inhibitor of HDAC1 and
HDAC3. Ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in breast cancer
cells leads to the accumulation of 3-bromopyruvate inside
the cells with subsequent inhibition of HDAC1/HDAC3,
resulting in cell death. These findings uncover a new and
novel molecular mechanism for the tumor-suppressive activity of 3-bromopyruvate.

bromopyruvate were obtained from Sigma Chemical
Company (St. Louis, Mo). Human SLC5A8 and mouse
Slc5a8 originally were cloned from human intestine and
mouse kidney, respectively.20,22 Rat Slc5a8 was cloned
by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR) using liver messenger RNA as the
template.

Functional Expression of SLC5A8
Combinational DNAs in Human Retinal
Pigment Epithelial Cells
Human, mouse, and rat SLC5A8 combinational DNAs
(DNAs) were expressed in human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cells using the vaccinia virus expression technique.20,22 Uptake of (14C)-nicotinate (15 lM) was
measured with a 15-minute incubation. HRPE cells that
were transfected with empty vector were used to measure
background transport activity. Uptake measurements in
vector-transfected cells and cDNA-transfected cells were
made in parallel, and the SLC5A8-specific transport was
determined by subtracting the transport values measured
in vector-transfected cells from the transport values measured in cDNA-transfected cells. The uptake buffer was
25 mM N-(2-hydroxethyl) piperazine-NA-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)/Tris, pH 7.5, that contained 140
mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM
MgSO4, and 5 mM glucose. Dose-response studies were
done to determine the concentration necessary to cause
50% inhibition (IC50) value for the inhibition of nicotinate uptake by pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate. Experiments were repeated 3 times; and, in each experiment,
measurements were made in duplicate or triplicate.
Results are given as means  standard errors.
Functional Expression of Human SLC5A8 in
Xenopus laevis Oocytes
Capped cRNA from human SLC5A8 cDNA (cloned in
pGH19, a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression vector) was
synthesized using the mMESSAGE-mMACHINE kit
(Ambion, Austin, Tex). Mature oocytes from X. laevis
were injected with 50 ng cRNA. Water-injected oocytes
served as controls. Electrophysiological studies were performed by using the 2-microelectrode voltage-clamp
method.20 Oocytes were perifused with a NaCl-containCancer

ing buffer (100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2,
1 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) followed by
the same buffer containing pyruvate or 3-bromopyruvate.
The membrane potential was clamped at 50 mV. The
differences between the steady-state currents measured in
the presence and absence of substrates were considered as
the substrate-induced currents. In the analysis of the saturation kinetics, K0.5 (ie, the substrate concentration necessary for the induction of half-maximal current) was
calculated by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to
the values of the substrate-induced currents. The Naþactivation kinetics were analyzed by measuring the substrate-specific currents in the presence of increasing concentrations of Naþ. The data for the Naþ-dependent
currents were analyzed according to the Hill equation to
determine the Hill coefficient (h; the number of Naþ ions
involved in the activation process) and K0.5 for Naþ (ie,
the concentration of Naþ necessary for half-maximal activation). Because expression levels varied significantly
from oocyte to oocyte, kinetic analyses were done by normalizing the expression levels. This was done by taking
the maximally induced SLC5A8-specific current in each
kinetic experiment in individual oocytes as 1. To investigate the current-voltage (I-V) relationship, step changes in
membrane potential were applied, each for 100 msec in
20-mV increments. Each experiment was repeated with
4 different oocytes.

Ectopic Expression of SLC5A8 in the
Mammary Cancer Cell Line MCF7
Cells were seeded either in 10-cm (for protein) or in
35-mm (for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
[FACS]) culture dishes and cultured in the absence of
pyruvate. Cells were transfected with pcDNA or
human SLC5A8 cDNA using Fugene 6 (Roche, Nutley, NJ) and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif).
pEGFP-N1 was used for cotransfection to determine
transfection efficiency. After 24 hours, cells were
treated with or without pyruvate or 3-bromopyruvate
(1 mM) for 24 hours. Cells were collected, centrifuged, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline PBS for preparation of protein lysates. For
FACS analysis, cells were fixed in 50% ethanol;

MCF7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured in
Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM). After 24
hours, cells were transfected with HDAC1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), HDAC2 siRNA, or HDAC3 siRNA
(catalog numbers sc-29343 for HDAC1 siRNA, sc-29345

MCF7 cells were plated (50,000 cells per dish) in 10cm dishes. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were
treated with 50 -azacytidine or 50 -aza-deoxycytidine
(2 lg/mL) for 72 hours. Medium was changed every
24 hours with the DNA methylation inhibitors added
fresh each time. After 72 hours, the cells were treated
with 3-bromopyruvate (1 mM) for 48 hours. Then, the

For analysis of the expression of HDAC isoforms
HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 in MCF7 cells, RNA

Western Blot Analysis
Fifty micrograms of protein were fractionated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
(Schleicher & Schull Bioscience Inc., Keene, NH).
Membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and then hybridized with antihistone H4 and antiacetylated histone H4-Lys16 antibody (both from Upstate
Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 4 C overnight,
followed by treatment with appropriate secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour. Proteins were
observed by ECL Super Signal Western System (GE
Healthcare, Madison, Wis).
Colony-Formation Assay
MCF7 cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes with
pcDNA3.1 or SLC5A8 expression construct along with
pEGFP-N1 to check the transfection efficiency. The next
day, cells were trypsinized and seeded into 6-well plates
(10,000 cells per well) in DMEM without pyruvate. After
24 hours, cells were exposed to 750 lg/mL G418 and different concentrations of pyruvate or 3-bromopyruvate for
2 weeks, and the medium was changed every 3 days. Cells
were washed with PBS and fixed in 100% methanol for
30 minutes followed by staining with KaryoMax Giemsa
stain for 1 hour. The wells were washed with water and
dried overnight at room temperature. Finally, the contents in the wells were dissolved with 1% SDS in 0.2 N
NaOH for 1 hour, and the optical density of the released
dye was measured at 630 nm.
Measurement of Histone

A commercially available kit (BioVision, Mountain View,
Calif) was used to determine HDAC activity. MCF7 cells
were transfected with pcDNA or SLC5A8 cDNA followed by treatment with or without pyruvate or 3-bromopyruvate (1 mM) for 24 hours. Cells were lysed, and
100 lg of protein in the lysate were used for the enzyme
assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
activity of recombinant human HDAC isoforms also was
measured using the same kit. The recombinant HDAC
isoforms were purchased from Cayman Chemical
Company (Ann Arbor, Mich).

and (C) human was expressed in human retinal pigment epithelial cells, and the transport function was monitored by the
uptake of nicotinate (15 lM) in the presence of Naþ. Uptake

RESULTS
Interaction of 3-Bromopyruvate With
SLC5A8 in a Mammalian Cell
Expression System
We compared the abilities of pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate to compete with nicotinate for uptake by mouse, rat,
and human SLC5A8 in a mammalian cell expression
system using HRPE cells (Fig. 1A-C). The transport function of the heterologously expressed transporter
was monitored by the uptake of (14C)nicotinate (15 lM;
15-minute incubation) in the presence of NaCl. Under
control conditions, nicotinate uptake in cDNA-transfected cells was 7-fold to 15-fold greater than the uptake
in vector-transfected cells. With rat Slc5a8, the uptake
was inhibited 60% with 1 mM pyruvate and 97% with
1 mM 3-bromopyruvate. The corresponding values for
Cancer

inhibition were 75% (1 mM pyruvate) and 98% (1 mM
3-bromopyruvate) with mouse Slc5a8 and 55% (1 mM
pyruvate) and 96% (1 mM 3-bromopyruvate) with
human SLC5A8. The IC50 value for the inhibition of
human SLC5A8 was 652  139 lM for pyruvate and 32
 9 lM for 3-bromopyruvate (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that 3-bromopyruvate interacts with the transporter
in all 3 species with high affinity. However, these data do
not indicate whether or not 3-bromopyruvate is a transportable substrate for SLC5A8. 3-Bromopyruvate may be
a transportable substrate that competes with nicotinate for
the transport process. Alternatively, 3-bromopyruvate
may function as a blocker of the transporter by interacting
with the substrate-binding site without itself being translocated across the membrane. In both cases, 3-bromopyruvate can cause inhibition of nicotinate uptake. The
approach used here with the mammalian expression system cannot differentiate between these 2 possibilities.

Direct Evidence for the Transport of
3-Bromopyruvate by SLC5A8
SLC5A8 from rat, mouse, and human tissues is an Naþcoupled, electrogenic transporter. Transport of substrates
through the transporter is associated with membrane
depolarization, which can be detected by electrophysiologic means. If a compound is a blocker and not a transportable substrate, then it will not cause membrane
depolarization. The X. laevis oocyte expression system is
useful to differentiate between a transportable substrate
and a blocker for any electrogenic transporter.29,30 To
determine whether 3-bromopyruvate is a transportable
substrate or a blocker of SLC5A8, we expressed human
SLC5A8 in X. laevis oocytes by injection of SLC5A8
cRNA and monitored its transport function electrophysiologically using the 2-microelectrode voltage-clamp
technique. Because the SLC5A8-mediated transport process is associated electrogenically with membrane depolarization, it can be detected with this technique in the form
of inward currents. First, we used pyruvate as a positive
control. Perifusion of SLC5A8-expressing oocytes with
1 mM pyruvate induced inward currents in the presence
of NaCl. The currents were not detectable in the absence
of Naþ (Fig. 2A), indicating the obligatory nature of
Naþ for the process. Perifusion of the oocytes with 1 mM
3-bromopyruvate also induced inward currents in an
4659

Original Article

(depolarization). This is an expected feature of an electrogenic transport process through a solute carrier. This suggests that the transport process is energized not only by
the transmembrane concentration gradient of Naþ but
also by the membrane potential. The currents induced by
pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate were saturable with
increasing concentrations of these compounds (Fig.
3B,C). The K0.5 value was 312  16 lM for pyruvate and
495  25 lM for 3-bromopyruvate. The Naþ-activation
kinetics of 3-bromopyruvate–induced currents was sigmoidal, indicating that more than 1 Naþ was involved in
the activation process (Fig. 3D). The Hill coefficient for
the activation of transport by Naþ was 1.4  0.2, suggesting that 3-bromopyruvate is transported by SLC5A8 with
an Naþ:3-bromopyruvate stoichiometry of 2:1. The K0.5
value for Naþ to activate the transport process was 32  4
mM. Because 3-bromopyruvate is a monocarboxylate
with a single negative charge, simultaneous transport of 2
Naþ with 1 3-bromopyruvate will result in the transfer of
1 net positive charge into the oocyte. This provides the
molecular basis for membrane depolarization associated
with the transport process.

that this compound is a transportable substrate for

50% of the current induced by pyruvate (Fig. 2B).
Next, we characterized the kinetic features of
SLC5A8-mediated 3-bromopyruvate transport. Similar
to pyruvate, transport of 3-bromopyruvate also was influenced by membrane potential (Fig. 3A). The inward current induced by 3-bromopyruvate increased as the
membrane potential was increased (hyperpolarization)
and decreased as the membrane potential was decreased

Relevance of SLC5A8-Mediated Transport
and Subsequent Inhibition of Histone
Deacetylases to the Tumor-Suppressive
Function of 3-Bromopyruvate
MCF7 cells (a human breast cancer cell line) were not
affected when they were cultured in the presence of pyruvate (1 mM) or 3-bromopyruvate (1 mM). This is evident
from the lack of any change in apoptosis under these
conditions compared with control (ie, in the absence of
pyruvate or 3-bromopyruvate) in vector-transfected cells
(Fig. 4A). SLC5A8 is a tumor suppressor that is silenced
in cancer. Like in most tumor cells, the transporter is not
expressed in MCF7 cells.27 When SLC5A8 was expressed
ectopically in these cells, pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate
induced marked apoptosis, demonstrating that SLC5A8
is necessary for the tumor-suppressive effect of 3-bromopyruvate in these cells. We used an alternative approach to
confirm these findings. Instead of the ectopic expression
of SLC5A8, we induced the expression of endogenous
SLC5A8 by treating the cells with the DNA methylation
inhibitors 50 -azacytidine or 50 -azadeoxycytidine, followed
by treatment with pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate. Again,

pyruvate (data not shown) and 3-bromopyruvate induced
apoptosis only when the cells were treated with the DNA
methylation inhibitors (Fig. 4B). We then used the colony-formation assay to determine the IC50 values for pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate to interfere with cell viability
in MCF7 cells (Fig. 4C). Vector-transfected cells were
affected only minimally in the presence of increasing concentrations of these 2 compounds. In contrast, when
SLC5A8 was expressed ectopically, the cells failed to form
colonies in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of pyruvate (IC50 value, 65  12 lM) and 3bromopyruvate (IC50 value, 45  5 lM). The induction
of cell death in MCF7 cells by pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate was associated with inhibition of HDACs (Fig.
4D). When vector-transfected MCF7 cells were cultured
in the presence of 1 mM pyruvate or 3-bromopyruvate,
there was no change in HDAC activity. However, when
cells that were transfected with SLC5A8 cDNA were cultured in the presence of 1 mM pyruvate or 3-bromopyruvate, the activity of HDACs was reduced by 70% to 80%.
This corroborated with changes in the acetylation status

of histone H4-Lys16 (Fig. 4E). The acetylation status of
this lysine residue increased in SLC5A8-expressing MCF7
cells when they were cultured in the presence of pyruvate
or 3-bromopyruvate. Dose-response studies with a cellfree system using MCF7 cell lysate as the source of
HDAC activity demonstrated that pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate inhibited HDACs in these cells with
comparable IC50 values (69  12 lM for pyruvate and
56  11 lM for 3-bromopyruvate) (Fig. 4F).

HDAC3 and then exposed the cells to 3-bromopyruate.
We confirmed the silencing of the siRNA targets by
RT-PCR (Fig. 6A). A scrambled siRNA was used as a
negative control. The silencing of either HDAC1 or
HDAC3 itself induced significant apoptosis in MCF7
cells (Fig. 6B); subsequent treatment with 3-bromopyruvate did not have any added effect. In contrast, silencing of HDAC2 did not cause apoptosis in the presence
or absence of 3-bromopyruvate. These results suggest
that 3-bromopyruvate–induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells
is most likely mediated through inhibition of HDAC1/
HDAC3.

DISCUSSION
The current studies delineate a novel mechanism for the
antitumor activity of 3-bromopyruvate. Here, we demonstrated that 3-bromopyruvate is a transportable substrate
for SLC5A8, a plasma membrane transporter with tumorsuppressive function. The transport process is electrogenic
and is obligatorily dependent on Naþ. The Naþ:3-broCancer

mopyruvate stoichiometry of 2:1 suggests that the transport process is associated with the transfer of 1 net positive
charge into cells. This provides the basis for the electrogenic nature of the transport process, which is supported
by the inward currents induced by 3-bromopyruvate in
SLC5A8-expressing oocytes in the presence of Naþ under
voltage-clamp conditions. Thus, SLC5A8 is able to mediate the concentrative entry of 3-bromopyruvate into cells.
We also demonstrated that 3-bromopyruvate is a potent
inhibitor of HDACs. HDAC1 and HDAC3 are the specific targets. It is important to note that these are the 2 isoforms that are up-regulated in cancer. We have provided
evidence for increased expression of these 2 isoforms in
colon cancer28 and in breast cancer (data not shown). The
transport of 3-bromopyruvate through SLC5A8 in
MCF7 cells and the subsequent intracellular inhibition of
HDAC1/HDAC3 underlies the ability of this compound
to cause cell death in these cells. The findings that siRNAmediated silencing of HDAC1 or HDAC3 also induces
apoptosis in breast cancer cells are consistent with these
conclusions.

FIGURE 6. This figure illustrates the relevance of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) inhibition and HDAC3 inhibition to 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP)-induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells. MCF7 cells were transfected with HDAC1-specific, HDAC2-specific, and HDAC3specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and then incubated with or without 3-BP (1 mM) for 48 hours. Scrambled siRNA was
used as a negative control. (A) RNA was extracted from these cells, and the expression of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 was monitored by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis using isoform-specific primers. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control. (B) Cells were treated as described in A and then used for fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis to monitor apoptosis. Data shown are means  standard errors (n ¼ 3).

Currently, it is believed that 3-bromopyruvate
exerts its antitumor effect by depleting ATP specifically
in tumor cells.5,10,11 The targets responsible for energy
depletion are the metabolic pathways associated with glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Because these
pathways operate in both normal cells and tumor cells,
the question arises regarding the mechanism responsible
for the tumor cell-specific effect of 3-bromopyruvate. It
has been speculated that, because it is a structurally
related analog of pyruvate, 3-bromopyruvate may enter
cells through MCTs.5,10,11 Tumor cell metabolism yields
large amounts of lactate; therefore, tumor cells up-regulate some isoforms of MCTs as a means of exporting lactate, thereby protecting themselves from undue
intracellular acidification.7 MCT-mediated entry of 3bromopyruvate may explain the tumor cell-specific effect
of this compound. It is noteworthy that we did not
observe any significant cell death in vector-transfected
MCF7 cells when the cells were cultured in the presence
of 3-bromopyruvate. These cells do not express SLC5A8
because of silencing of the gene by DNA methylation27;
4664

therefore, the entry of 3-bromopyruvate into these cells
must depend on MCTs. However, the expression levels
of MCTs in this cell line are very low, although it is a
malignant cell line.31 This could be the reason why these
cells are resistant to 3-bromopyruvate. The same cells
become highly susceptible to cell death induced by 3-bromopyruvate when SLC5A8 is expressed ectopically,
because this provides an active mechanism for the entry
of the compound into cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the antitumor activity of 3-bromopyruvate in
liver and pancreatic cancer cell lines; however, to our
knowledge, there is no information available on the levels
of expression of MCTs or SLC5A8 in these cells.14,16,17
Obviously, these cells must have a mechanism for 3bromopyruvate entry, but the identity of the transporter
responsible for the process is not known.
The current studies also demonstrate that 3-bromopyruvate is a potent HDAC inhibitor with selectivity
toward HDAC1 and HDAC3. HDAC inhibitors have
been recognized as potential antitumor agents; several
such compounds have shown potential in clinical

trials.32,33 The finding that 3-bromopyruvate is an
HDAC inhibitor is not all that surprising based on our
previous finding that pyruvate is a potent inhibitor of
HDAC1 and HDAC3.27,28 However, there may be significant differences in the mechanism of inhibition
between pyruvate and 3-bromopyruvate. 3-Bromopyruvate is an alkylating agent, whereas pyruvate is not. Therefore, it is possible that 3-bromopyruvate causes
irreversible inhibition of HDAC1/HDAC3 by covalently
modifying the enzyme. This may not be the case with pyruvate. Irrespective of the mechanism, inhibition of
HDACs is likely to contribute to the antitumor activity of
3-bromopyruvate.
Tumor cells will be susceptible to 3-bromopyruvate
only if a transport mechanism exists for the entry of this
compound. SLC5A8 is not expressed in most tumor cells.
We speculate that tumor cells silence SLC5A8 to prevent
cell death caused by pyruvate-induced inhibition of
HDACs. SLC5A8 is an influx transporter because of
its coupling to a transmembrane electrochemical Naþ
gradient, whereas MCTs are facilitative. MCTs are upregulated in tumor cells to facilitate the elimination of lactate from the cells. It is the MCT4 isoform that is induced
in cancer.31,34 The in vitro efficacy of 3-bromopyruvate as
an anticancer agent in tumor cell lines, thus, will depend
on the level of expression of MCT4. The silencing of
SLC5A8 in tumor cells and in primary tumors occurs by
an epigenetic mechanism that involves DNA methylation.
Treatment of tumor cells with DNA methylation inhibitors reactivates the expression of the gene.18,26,27 Several
DNA methylation inhibitors have shown promise for the
treatment of solid tumors and lymphoma.35 If inhibition
of DNA methylation in vivo induces re-expression of
SLC5A8 in tumors, then 3-bromopyruvate and DNA
methylation inhibitors may synergize to improve efficacy
in cancer treatment.
