Abstract
NOTCH signaling is deregulated in the majority of T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) as a result of activating
mutations in NOTCH1. Gamma secretase inhibitors (GSI)
block proteolytic activation of NOTCH receptors and may
provide a targeted therapy for T-ALL. We have investigated the
mechanisms of GSI sensitivity across a panel of T-ALL cell
lines, yielding an approach for patient stratification based on
pathway activity and also providing a rational combination
strategy for enhanced response to GSI. Whereas the NOTCH1
mutation status does not serve as a predictor of GSI
sensitivity, a gene expression signature of NOTCH pathway
activity does correlate with response, and may be useful in the
selection of patients more likely to respond to GSI. Furthermore, inhibition of the NOTCH pathway activity signature
correlates with the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors CDKN2D (p19INK4d) and CDKN1B (p27Kip1), leading
to derepression of RB and subsequent exit from the cell cycle.
Consistent with this evidence of cell cycle exit, short-term
exposure of GSI resulted in sustained molecular and phenotypic effects after withdrawal of the compound. Combination
treatment with GSI and a small molecule inhibitor of CDK4
produced synergistic growth inhibition, providing evidence
that GSI engagement of the CDK4/RB pathway is an important
mechanism of GSI action and supports further investigation
of this combination for improved efficacy in treating T-ALL.

Introduction
The NOTCH signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved
regulator of cell fate, differentiation, and growth (1, 2). In the
hematopoietic system, NOTCH functions at multiple binary
decision points. During lymphopoiesis, NOTCH1 activity drives
uncommitted progenitor cells toward a T-cell fate, rather than
B-cell commitment (3). Deregulated NOTCH1 is oncogenic,
promoting the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia

(T-ALL). Somatic activating mutations in NOTCH1 are present in
>50% of patients with T-ALL (4, 5). NOTCH1 is also the target of a
recurrent, albeit rare translocation (t7;9)(q34;q34.3), that results in
the expression of constitutively active cytoplasmic fragments of
the receptor (6, 7). Expression of the active cytoplasmic domain
of NOTCH1 (NICD) in murine bone marrow cells is sufficient to
induce T-cell leukemia with high penetrance in mice (8).
In mammals, NOTCH signaling is mediated by four NOTCH
receptors (NOTCH1–4) and five ligands related to the invertebrate
orthologues Delta, Serrate, and Lag-2. Physiologic NOTCH signaling
is activated by a series of proteolytic cleavage events, culminating
in the release of the intracellular domain (NICD) via liganddependent cleavage mediated by the gamma secretase (GS)
complex. Upon GS cleavage, NICD translocates to the nucleus in
which it binds to the transcription factor CSL and other proteins,
and activates the transcription of NOTCH target genes. The best
characterized NOTCH target genes are bHLH transcription factors
of the hairy enhancer of split (HES) gene family, including HES1,
HES5, HEY1, HEY2, and HEYL (3).
The prevalence of NOTCH1 activating mutations in T-ALL
patient samples suggests that NOTCH is a core oncogenic pathway
in this disease and therefore a prime therapeutic target. Gamma
secretase inhibitors (GSI) hold promise as targeted therapy for
malignancies that are driven by aberrant NOTCH activity, such
as T-ALL. Although the presence of activating mutations within
NOTCH1 suggests that the cells are dependent on the receptor, not
all NOTCH mutated cell lines are sensitive to GSI (4). These results
indicate that mutational status may not be an effective predictive
marker for response to GSI in the clinic. A detailed understanding
of the downstream signaling network that is engaged by NOTCH
in T-ALL cells would shed light on such mechanisms, revealing
markers that may help predict patients that would respond to GSIs.
A better understanding of the NOTCH signaling pathway would
also provide a rational basis for choosing therapeutics that could
be combined with GSIs to improve therapeutic benefit. Recent
studies have begun to reveal some of the pathways engaged by
NOTCH in T-ALL cells. NOTCH directly induces MYC transcription
and overexpression of MYC confers GSI resistance to T-ALL cells
in vitro (9–11). The nuclear factor nB and mTOR pathways have
recently been shown to be activated by NOTCH, providing a
rationale for combination therapies with bortezomib and rapamycin analogues, respectively (12, 13).

and CDK6, is inactivated either through deletion, mutation, or
silencing in f90% of T-ALL patient samples (14–17). Evidence that
cyclin D–dependent kinase signaling is essential in NOTCH-driven
T-ALL comes from analysis of the cyclin D3 knockout mouse.
Expression of NOTCH1 NICD in wild-type bone marrow cells gives
rise to T-ALL in recipient mice with 100% penetrance, whereas no
leukemia develops when NICD is expressed in cyclin D3 / bone
marrow cells (18).
This study shows that baseline NOTCH pathway activity
measured using a NOTCH target gene signature is predictive of
sensitivity to a GSI, and hence, may provide a tool for patient
stratification to enrich for response. Second, investigation of the
molecular mechanisms of GSI response in T-ALL cells revealed that
inhibition of NOTCH signaling induces the expression of CDK
inhibitors, CDKN2D (p19INK4d) and CDKN1B (p27Kip1), thereby
engaging RB-mediated arrest, and importantly, leading to cell cycle
exit. Consistent with this mechanism of action, combined
treatment of T-ALL cells with GSI and a small molecule inhibitor
of CDK4 sensitizes T-ALL cells to GSI action.

Materials and Methods
Compounds. MRK-003 (active GSI) and MRK-006 (275-fold less active
enantiomer control) were previously described (19). Stocks in DMSO were
used for dilutions (10 mmol/L) described in this study. DMSO stocks
(2.5 mmol/L) were used for dilutions of the CDK4 inhibitor, a 6-substituted
indolocarbazole, 2-bromo-12,13-dihydro-5H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]
carbazole-5,7(6H)-dione (Calbiochem, Inc). Selectivity of this CDK4 inhibitor
is as follows: IC50s in enzymatic assays are 76 nmol/L, 520 nmol/L, and
2.1 Amol/L for CDK4/cyclin D1, CDK2/cyclin E, and CDK1/cyclin B,
respectively.
Cell culture and cell viability. Human T-ALL cell lines were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection or Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen. Cell lines were maintained in RPMI
supplemented with 10% to 15% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L of
glutamine. For GI50 (growth inhibition as measured by an ATP-based
viability assay) analyses, T-ALL cell lines were plated in 96-well plates at
5,000 cells/well, except for T-ALL-1 cells which were plated at 10,000 cells/
well. Cells were re-fed and resuspended with compound and medium on
day 4. Viability assays were performed using the CellTiter-Glo kit (Promega)
7 days after compound addition. For larger scale compound treatments,
T-ALL cell lines were plated in T-150 flasks at 200,000 cells/mL and treated
with 5 Amol/L of GSI (MRK-003). Washout studies were performed using
10 Amol/L of GSI. T-150 cultures were also re-fed on day 4. The CDK4
inhibitor was used at 500 nmol/L in combination studies. mRNA was
isolated from cells following treatment with DMSO, 0.1 or 1 Amol/L of
GSI (MRK-003) for 3 days and microarray gene expression analysis was
conducted as previously described (20).
Western blot. Standard Western blotting procedures were used. Blots
were scanned using a Gel Doc (Bio-Rad) and quantitated using Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad). RB underphosphorylated signal was quantitated as
a ratio to total RB after actin normalization. Antibodies used as follows:
RB-underphosphorylated (BD Biosciences) RB-Total, CDKN1B (Cell
Signaling Technologies), CDKN2D (Zymed Laboratories), NOTCH1-NICD
(Cell Signaling Technologies), and beta-actin (Abcam, Inc.). For NICD
Western blot detection, refer to ref. (20). Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham)
were used for chemiluminescent detection.
Flow cytometry. DNA content analysis was performed using propidium
iodide/RNase buffer (BD Biosciences) or Draq5. Briefly, 1  106 cells were
harvested and fixed with 70% ethanol for 20 min on ice, washed and then
resuspended in 500 AL of propidium iodide buffer for 15 min at room
temperature followed by analysis on flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD
Biosciences). Draq5 staining was performed by incubating 200,000 live
cells with 10 Amol/L of Draq5 for 5 min followed by flow cytometric analysis

(488 nm excitation). Mini-chromosome maintenance complex component
6 (MCM6) staining was performed by harvesting 3  105 cells, fixing in
2% paraformaldehyde (BD Biosciences) for 20 min on ice, followed by
permeabilization using Intra-Cyte wash buffer (Orion BioSolutions) for
45 min. Cells were washed twice and stained with MCM6-FITC antibody
(BD Biosciences) at 1:200 dilution for 1 h on ice.
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR analysis. T-ALL cell lines were
treated with DMSO or MRK-003 (active GSI) for 48 h and then harvested.
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was
synthesized using the High Capacity Archive kit (Applied Biosystems).
Quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI 7900 using the DDCT protocol
using their inventoried TaqMan probes/primers for human CDKN2D,
CDKN1B, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (as internal
control). Analysis was performed using the SDS 2.2.2 software (Applied
Biosystems).
Expression profiling analysis. Global expression profiling of the T-ALL
cell lines was performed on MRK-003 and DMSO treated cells as previously
reported (20). Genes which correlated with GSI sensitivity, GI50, were
determined by the transcriptional response (treated versus DMSO at log10
scale) of 15 T-ALL cell lines treated with GSI (0.1 and 1 Amol/L) for 3 days.
To establish a threshold for selecting the genes whose expression
significantly anticorrelated with the GI50, a Monte Carlo simulation was
conducted. Based on 100 simulations, genes which showed a correlation
coefficient lower than 0.4 were selected as genes significantly (P < 0.05)
anticorrelated with GI50 among the GSI-treated cell lines.
These genes were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity
Systems)6. Microarray data have been deposited in the GEO database under
accession number GSE8416.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. KOPTK1 cells treated with
DMSO or 5 Amol/L of GSI (MRK-003) for 24 h were used for chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (EZ-chip kit; Millipore). Cells (2  107)
were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde. Chromatin was sheared to an
average DNA size of 500 bp, then incubated overnight with 5 Ag of anti–
c-Myc (N262; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG antibodies.
Immunoprecipitated DNA was washed, de–cross-linked and purified, then
used in TaqMan PCR (Applied Biosystems) and PCR (GC-Rich PCR system;
Roche).
The primers used for PCR of BSII are 5¶-CCCTCTAGGAGGTGCTAAGTAAATATTT-3¶ and 5¶-ACTGAGCCAGCAGGAAAGGA-3¶. The primers and
probes used for TaqMan PCR are listed in Supplemental Table S1.
Analysis of combined drug effects. Drug synergy was determined by
the combination index method (non–constant ratio) using the CalcuSyn
software.7 Using the data obtained from the growth inhibition assays
(Fig. 5C), combination index values were generated over a range of
fractional growth inhibition. A combination index of 1 indicates an additive
effect, a combination index <1 indicates synergy, and a combination index
>1 indicates antagonism.
Virus production and T-ALL cell line infection. HEK293T cells were
transfected with either the empty vector (MigR1) or a vector encoding the
intracellular form of NOTCH1 (MigR1 NICD) along with pKatAmpho and
pCMV-VSV-G using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants
were removed 60 h later, filtered, and used to infect T-ALL-1 cells in the
presence of polybrene. Infected cells were collected by flow sorting of
GFP+ cells.
NOTCH1 sequencing. Status of exon 26, exon 27, and exon 34 of
NOTCH1 in the T-ALL cell lines is indicated as previously described (4).

Results
Identification of a NOTCH pathway gene signature that
predicts sensitivity to GSI. In a subset of human T-ALL cell lines
with activating mutations in NOTCH1, treatment with GSIs leads to
cell cycle arrest and cell death (4, 19). We have previously shown

that several T-ALL cell lines with detectable levels of NICD are
resistant to GSI treatment, suggesting that other measures of GSI
sensitivity are needed (20). We measured GSI sensitivity by
determining GI50 values (growth inhibition as measured by an
ATP-based viability assay) for 15 T-ALL cell lines, after exposure to
GSI (MRK-003) for 7 days. A comparison of this data to NOTCH1

mutation status (t test; P = 0.19) and NICD levels (t test, 0 versus
1–3; P = 0.35) shows that neither mutation status nor NICD protein
levels effectively identify T-ALL cell lines sensitive to GSI (Table 1).
We used transcriptional profiling to determine if a gene
signature could be identified that predicts sensitivity to GSI in
T-ALL. The 15 T-ALL cell lines described in Table 1 were profiled

and 10 NOTCH target genes (HES-1, HES-4, HES-5, HEY-L, HEY-2,
DTX1, C-MYC, NRARP, PTCRA, and SHQ1; refs. 3, 9) were used to
assess NOTCH pathway activity. A composite expression score for
NOTCH pathway activity was determined by calculating the
average expression value of 10 NOTCH target genes (NOTCH-10)
for each of the 15 cell lines. This score was then compared with the
GI50 of each cell line, which showed that the basal NOTCH pathway
activity correlates with sensitivity to GSI (Fig. 1A). The presence
of mutations in genes that modulate NOTCH signaling may
explain why some resistant cell lines (JURKAT and MOLT-4) display
a high signature score (see Discussion). Change in expression of
the NOTCH-10 gene set in response to GSI treatment was also
assessed. The 10-gene pathway signature was down-regulated in
the GSI-sensitive cells, exhibiting a positive correlation to GSI
sensitivity (Fig. 1B).
NOTCH inhibition by GSI and the induction of a G1-S
checkpoint gene set in T-ALL cells. In order to better understand
the biological processes that are related to GSI efficacy downstream of NOTCH inhibition, we utilized Ingenuity Pathway

Analysis to identify gene sets that were enriched in a manner
which correlated with GSI sensitivity across the T-ALL cell line
panel. Genes involved in the G1-S checkpoint were found to be
overrepresented among sensitivity-related, GSI-modulated genes
(P = 0.0016). This is consistent with observations that GSI
treatment leads to a slow accumulation of cells in the G1-G0 phase
of the cell cycle (4, 9, 19). Among the G1-S genes regulated by GSI
were CDKN2D and CDKN1B, which act as inhibitors of the G1-S
transition by blocking the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases
CDK4, CDK6, and CDK2. The induction of CDKN2D and CDKN1B
by GSI correlated with the change in NOTCH signaling across
the cell line panel, as measured by the 10-gene NOTCH signature
(Fig. 1C). The induction of these CDK inhibitors together or alone
correlated with the sensitivity to NOTCH inhibition among the
T-ALL cell line panel (CDKN1B correlation coefficient = 0.677,
P = 0.0056; CDKN2D correlation coefficient = 0.529, P = 0.035;
Fig. 2A). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of
T-ALL-1, DND-41, and RPMI-8402 cells treated for 48 hours with
GSI compared with DMSO control showed between a 2.5-fold and

3.5-fold up-regulation of CDKN2D and between a 1.3-fold and

Western blot kinetic analysis confirmed that CDKN2D was
induced 3-fold at the protein level within 24 hours of exposure
to the active MRK-003 but not by the DMSO control (Fig. 2B).
Importantly, CDKN2D up-regulation was observed prior to the
onset of the earliest stage of cell cycle arrest. MYC is a direct
target gene of NOTCH1 and effector of NOTCH signaling
(9, 11, 21). A previous study suggested that the CDKN2D gene is
bound and repressed by MYC (22), providing a possible
mechanism by which GSI-mediated inhibition of NOTCH results
in the induction of CDKN2D. Treatment of T-ALL cells with GSI
leads to a reduction of MYC protein and a 4-fold decrease in the

transcriptional start site, as measured by ChIP/reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Fig. 2B and C). CDKN1B protein was induced
1.5-fold by day 3, reaching 6-fold by day 5 of GSI treatment
(Fig. 2B). This is consistent with data indicating that CDKN1B is
regulated by NOTCH via transcriptional and posttranslational
mechanisms (23–26).
GSI inhibits RB phosphorylation prior to cell cycle arrest.
Treatment of T-ALL-1 cells with MRK-003 led to a reduction in the
percentage of actively cycling cells (Fig. 3A). This effect became
detectable after 72 hours of treatment. An enantiomer of MRK-003,
MRK-006, that lacks GSI activity had no such effect on the cell
cycle.

Gamma Secretase Inhibitor, RB Pathway, and Cell Cycle Exit

We find that GSI treatment resulted in the elevation of the active
hypophosphorylated form of RB, following the induction of the
CDKN2D (Fig. 3B). The active, hypophosphorylated form of RB was
detected within the first 2 days of GSI exposure in T-ALL cells and
increased steadily to day 5, whereas the inhibition of the cell cycle
was detectable by day 3 (Fig. 3B). The inactive enantiomer, MRK006, did not affect RB phosphorylation or cell cycle progression and
GSI-insensitive SKW-3 cells showed no significant increase in
the active RB species (Fig. 3C). Expression of NOTCH1 NICD in
T-ALL-1 cells abrogated the inhibition of RB phosphorylation
caused by GSI (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the cell cycle
arrest caused by inhibition of the NOTCH signaling pathway in
T-ALL cells is mediated by derepression of RB activity. Following
the onset of cell cycle arrest, after 3 days of GSI treatment, a sub-G1
cell population became detectable, indicative of cell death (Fig. 3A).

Continuous GSI exposure is unnecessary to induce phenotypic effects. DNA content alone cannot distinguish cells that are
arrested in G1 from cells that have exited the cell cycle (G0). In
order to distinguish between these two possibilities, cells were
stained with a fluorescently conjugated antibody to MCM6. MCM6,
a core component of the DNA replication preinitiation complex, is
expressed during all phases of the cell cycle but is undetectable
when cells have exited the cell cycle (27, 28). We assessed MCM6
protein expression in T-ALL-1 cells by flow cytometry after 5 days
of GSI treatment (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S2). Down-regulation
of MCM6 was observed as compared with untreated and MRK-006
controls. In control samples (treated with inactive MRK-006), 97%
of cells with 2N DNA content express high levels of MCM6 protein,
whereas this percentage dropped to only 4% in samples treated

data shows multiple components of the DNA synthesis preinitiation complex (MCM4, MCM6, and CDC6) are also repressed in
GSI-sensitive T-ALL cell lines (Fig. 4B). Further evidence that
MRK-003 induces cell cycle withdrawal is provided by high
CDKN1B levels observed by day 5 of treatment (Figs. 2B and 4D;
ref. 23). Additionally, the pocket protein family member, RBL2/
p130, has also been shown to increase when cells exit the cell cycle
into the G0 quiescent state (Fig. 4B; refs. 29–31). We hypothesized
that if GSI treatment of T-ALL-1 cells results in cell cycle exit, then
continuous treatment with GSI may not be required. We compared
the cell cycle profiles of cells after continuous GSI treatment for

8 days with those treated for 24, 48, or 72 hours, followed by
compound removal with response measured on day 8. Interestingly,
48 hours of GSI treatment was sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest
(7.5-fold reduction in the S, G2-M cell population) and cell death
(10.5-fold increase in the sub-G1 population) similar to continuous
treatment for 8 days (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore,
sustained inhibition of RB phosphorylation and up-regulation of
CDKN1B are observed 6 days after compound removal (Fig. 4D),
suggesting these cells have truly exited from the cell cycle. Similar
effects of pulsetile treatment (48-hour washout) on cell cycle arrest
was observed using DND-41 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). NICD,

which could be measured in DND-41 but not T-ALL-1 cells,
recovers within 48 hours following compound washout (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Therefore, sustained inhibition of the S, G2-M
population and persistent induction of CDKN1B are observed
despite rapid recovery of NICD levels (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and C). These results show that 48-hour exposure to GSI is equally
effective as continuous treatment, over an 8-day period, and
provides additional support for GSI-mediated cell cycle exit in
NOTCH pathway–dependent T-ALL cells.
Combination of GSI with a CDK4 inhibitor results in potent
cell cycle arrest and death. The induction of CDKN2D and
inhibition of CDK-mediated RB-phosphorylation by GSI suggested
that treatment with a synthetic CDK4 inhibitor could sensitize
T-ALL cells to GSI. Therefore, T-ALL-1 cells were treated with
a combination of MRK-003 and cyclin D1-CDK4 inhibitor
(6-substituted indolocarbazole) and assessed for effects on RB
phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest, and cell viability. We observed a
more potent induction of hypophosphorylated RB within the first
3 days of treatment as compared with GSI or CDK4 inhibitor
treatment alone (Fig. 5A). DNA content analysis showed a 3-fold
reduction in the S, G2-M populations and a 4-fold up-regulation of
the nonviable sub-G1 population by day 5 of combination treatment
as compared with GSI alone (Fig. 5B). GSI effects on cell viability
were enhanced considerably by combination treatment, reducing
GI50 values by 6-fold to 8-fold in three different GSI-sensitive T-ALL
cell lines (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Table S2). Synergistic growth
inhibition was observed in these cell lines at multiple drug
concentrations, yielding combination index values of <1 (Supplementary Fig. S5A–C). The CDK4 inhibitor did not enhance GSI
effects in GSI-insensitive T-ALL cells, consistent with a lack of
NOTCH pathway dependence in these lines. These results indicate
that a combination treatment of GSI and a CDK4 inhibitor potently
enhance and accelerate cell cycle arrest and death in NOTCHdependent T-ALL cell lines. They further strengthen the role of the
RB pathway in the GSI response and suggest a possible combination
therapy for cancer patients with activated NOTCH signaling.

Discussion
Understanding the mechanism of GSI-induced cell death and
the ability to accurately identify patients most likely to respond
to GSI is critical to the successful clinical development of this
novel therapy. It is apparent from the treatment of T-ALL cell
lines with GSIs that the presence of an activating mutation in
NOTCH1 or constitutive expression of NICD does not effectively
predict response. We find that a gene signature composed of 10
NOTCH target genes is an effective reporter of pathway activity
and that this metric correlates with cellular sensitivity to GSI.
Hence, this signature may be useful as a patient stratification
tool for T-ALL as well as other NOTCH-activated tumor types
being considered for GSI therapy or other therapeutics that
target the NOTCH pathway. Although levels of NOTCH target
genes will aid in the identification of patients more likely to
respond to GSI, additional mechanisms of resistance may exist.
Such mechanisms seem to be present in two cell lines, JURKAT
and MOLT-4, which display elevated NOTCH target gene
expression and whose expression is modulated by GSI, however,
remain insensitive to treatment. Both of these cell lines are
deficient in the expression of PTEN (data not shown; ref. 32). In
addition, JURKAT cells express a mutated form of FBW7 (20). The
mutation of both PTEN and FBW7 are known to confer resistance
to GSI (20, 33, 34).

Previous studies have linked activated NOTCH signaling to
aberrant cell cycle progression and show that GSIs induce cell cycle
arrest in a subset of T-ALL cell lines. This study shows the
molecular events leading to growth arrest upon GSI treatment in
GSI-sensitive T-ALL cell lines. We show that prior to the onset of
cell cycle arrest, GSI induces CDKN2D, which coincides with the
inhibition of MYC. Genomic analysis of MYC binding and gene
regulation indicated that MYC functions as a transcriptional
repressor of CDKN2D (22), which is supported by our findings
that MYC binds to the CDKN2D promoter in T-ALL cells in a GSIsensitive manner. GSI treatment also led to the induction of
CDKN1B as previously observed (24).
The inductions of CDKN2D and CDKN1B (inhibitors of CDK4/6
and CDK2, respectively) are associated with the inhibition of RB
phosphorylation, and hence, RB activation. Previous genetic studies
indicate that deregulation of RB-mediated cell cycle control
through loss of the CDK inhibitor gene CDKN2A (p16) is a critical,
if not essential mechanism, during T-ALL leukemogenesis (35).
Moreover, deletion of cyclin D3, which promotes CDK4 and CDK6
activity, prevents the development of leukemia in the context of
activated NOTCH1 in mice (18). We propose that GSI-induced
expression of CDKN2D and CDKN1B restores RB-mediated
growth control in T-ALL cells that depend on deregulated cyclin
D–dependent kinase activity.
Critical decisions regarding growth versus quiescence are made
in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is governed by the
phosphorylation state of RB (36). Although CDKN2D induction
occurs prior to the onset of cell cycle arrest, the elevation of
CDKN1B occurs later. Hence, CDKN1B may not be a primary event
in driving the initial accumulation in G1-G0, but may play an
important role in the transition to a durable cell cycle exit in
cooperation with CDKN2D (37). Hypophosphorylated RB as well as
other RB family members, RBL1/p107 and RBL2/p130, are necessary
to efficiently halt the proliferation of cells to facilitate their exit
from cell cycle into G0 and promote differentiation (29, 30). The RB
family proteins have unique and overlapping functions in
tumorigenesis, and both RBL1/p107 and RBL2/p130 can compensate for RB inactivation or loss (30). We show that in addition to
the G1 cell cycle arrest previously reported, T-ALL cells exit the cell
cycle upon GSI treatment. Consequently, short-term exposure with
GSI (48 hours) is sufficient to induce similar phenotypic effects
as continuous exposure, indicating that a finite period of NOTCH
inhibition can lead to a long-term, apparently irreversible, state
change characterized by cell cycle exit. This has important clinical
implications as it suggests that intermittent dosing may be
sufficient to provide antitumor activity, and would be expected to
alleviate toxicities associated with continuous exposure to GSI.
Based on the data presented here and in other recent reports, we
propose a model by which GSI inhibition of NOTCH signaling in
T-ALL cells leads to arrest in G1 followed by cell cycle exit (Fig. 5D).
NOTCH inhibition simultaneously represses MYC and HES1
expression. Blockade of MYC expression leads to derepression of
CDKN2D whereas HES1 inhibition leads to the induction of
CDKN1B (25), resulting in combined inhibition CDK4/6 and CDK2,
elevated levels of hypophosphorylated, active RB, and G1 arrest.
A recent report has shown that HES1 is required to prevent
irreversible cell cycle exit of quiescent cells (38). Hence, we suggest
that GSI inhibition of HES1 has an additional role in allowing
G1-arrested cells to exit the cell cycle.
Finally, we show that a small molecule CDK4 inhibitor sensitizes
T-ALL cells to GSI. This underscores that the CDK4/6-RB pathway is

an important downstream mechanism through which GSI inhibits
the proliferation of T-ALL cells. These results suggest a rational
combination strategy to increase the therapeutic response to GSI in
treating T-ALL and other cancers with activated NOTCH signaling.
