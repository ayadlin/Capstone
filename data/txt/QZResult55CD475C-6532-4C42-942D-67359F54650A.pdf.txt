Abstract
Poor oral bioavailability limits the use of curcumin and other dietary polyphenols in the prevention and
treatment of cancer. Minimally invasive strategies that can provide effective and sustained tissue concentrations
of these agents will be highly valuable tools in the fight against cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of an injectable sustained release microparticle formulation of curcumin as a novel approach to
breast cancer chemoprevention. A biodegradable and biocompatible polymer, poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), was
used to fabricate curcumin microparticles. When injected s.c. in mice, a single dose of microparticles sustained
curcumin levels in the blood and other tissues for nearly a month. Curcumin levels in the lungs and brain, frequent sites of breast cancer metastases, were 10- to 30-fold higher than that in the blood. Further, curcumin
microparticles showed marked anticancer efficacy in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts compared
with other controls. Repeated systemic injections of curcumin were not effective in inhibiting tumor growth.
Treatment with curcumin microparticles resulted in diminished vascular endothelial growth factor expression
and poorly developed tumor microvessels, indicating a significant effect on tumor angiogenesis. These results
suggest that sustained delivery of chemopreventives such as curcumin using polymeric microparticles is a
promising new approach to cancer chemoprevention and therapy. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4443–52. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Curcumin, a dietary polyphenol derived from the root of
Curcuma longa Linn., has shown significant potential as a
chemopreventive, with beneficial effects in all the three
stages of carcinogenesis (1). Curcumin exerts its antitumor
effect by modulating the expression of multiple genes involved in tumor proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis (2). Despite its efficacy and safety, the clinical
usefulness of curcumin is diminished by its poor oral absorption and extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism, resulting in
low oral bioavailability (<1%; ref. 3). Several studies suggest
that oral consumption may not furnish adequate tissue levels
of curcumin necessary for effective cancer prevention and
treatment (4–8).
Previous preclinical studies have used repeated systemic
injections of curcumin to overcome poor oral bioavailability
(9, 10). However, this is not a clinically feasible approach to
chemoprevention. The current study is the first to report the

use of an injectable, sustained release formulation, which,
after a single dose, results in near-constant systemic concentrations of curcumin for several weeks and a significant inhibition of tumor growth in an orthotopic mammary tumor
model. Further, the results of the study show that sustained
low levels of curcumin achieved with microparticles may
elicit certain antitumor effects not observed after repeated
systemic injections.

Cell lines
MDA-MB-231 cells, stably transfected with luciferase, were
purchased from Caliper Life Sciences. 4T1, MCF-7, and EMT6 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection.
Formulation of curcumin-loaded PLGA microparticles
Curcumin microparticles were prepared using a modification of emulsion solvent evaporation technique (11, 12).
Curcumin (20 mg) and PLGA (20 mg) were solubilized in
chloroform (1.5 mL) and methanol (0.15 mL). This solution
was emulsified into 2% (w/v) aqueous PVA solution (6 mL)
by vortex mixing (Digital Vortex Mixer, VWR) at 1,000 rpm
for 2 minutes. The emulsion formed was subjected to high
vacuum (710 mm Hg) at 4°C using a rotary evaporator
(Laborta 4001 Efficient Rotaevaporator), which resulted in
rapid removal of the organic solvents. Microparticles were
recovered by centrifugation (5810R, Eppendorf) at 1,000
rpm for 10 minutes, washed twice with 10% (w/v) Tween
80 in endotoxin-free water (50 mL) and then twice with
endotoxin-free water (50 mL), and lyophilized (Freezone
4.5, Labconco).
Microparticle characterization
Mean diameter of microparticles was determined using
optical microscopy. Microparticles (∼1 mg) were dispersed
in 0.5 mL distilled water by sonication (model 3000, Misonix)
at 3 W for 60 seconds. A drop of this dispersion was placed
on a glass slide and observed under a microscope (Eclipse
TS100, Nikon Instruments) at ×400 magnification. Diameters
of 500 particles in several different fields were measured using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems), and the number average particle diameter was calculated. The morphology of
microparticles was examined using field emission scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). Microparticles were placed
on a double-stick carbon tape over aluminum stubs and carbon
coated. The coated samples were observed under an electron
microscope (JSM 6500F, JEOL) at ×1,500 magnification. To determine drug loading, microparticles (2 mg) were extracted
with 2 mL methanol for 18 hours (Labquake Shaker, Barnstead
Thermolyne). The methanolic extract was centrifuged at
13,500 rpm for 15 minutes, and curcumin concentration in
the supernatant was quantified by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC; System Gold 126 Solvent Module
and 508 Autosampler, Beckman Coulter) using a C-18 column
(Ultrasphere ODS, 250 mm ×4.6 mm internal diameter, 5-μm
particle size; Beckman). A 60:40 mixture of acetonitrile and
ammonium acetate (10 mmol/L, pH 4) was used as mobile
phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Curcumin was detected
using a PDA detector (System Gold 168 Detector) at a wavelength
of 430 nm. The retention time of curcumin under these
conditions was 5.8 minutes. Drug loading in microparticles
(%, w/w) was defined as the amount of curcumin in 100 mg
of microparticles.
In vitro release of curcumin from microparticles
The release study was done in a six-well plate containing
Transwell inserts with a pore size of 400 nm. PBS (0.15 mol/L,

4444

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

pH 7.4) containing 10% (w/v) Tween 80, 0.1% (w/v)
N-acetylcysteine, and 0.01% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene
was used as the release buffer. Curcumin-loaded microparticles (equivalent to 2 μg curcumin), suspended in 1 mL of
the release buffer, were placed on top of the Transwell
insert, and 3 mL of the release buffer were added to
the bottom of the well. The six-well plates with the inserts
were sealed with parafilm and placed in an incubator
shaker (C24 Incubator Shaker, New Brunswick Scientific)
set at 100 rpm and 37°C. At various time intervals, the
entire release buffer in the bottom chamber was removed
and replaced with fresh release buffer. Curcumin concentration in the release buffer was quantified by HPLC.
The composition of the release buffer was optimized to
ensure that curcumin released from microparticles was
soluble and stable in the buffer. A control experiment performed with curcumin solution (instead of microparticles)
confirmed rapid (<8 h) equilibration of curcumin between
the two chambers.
Inflammatory response to microparticles in mice
All animal experiments were carried out in compliance
with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees at Wayne State University and the University of Minnesota. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice
(Charles River Laboratories) were injected s.c. with a single
dose of curcumin-loaded microparticles or blank microparticles. Untreated animals were used as negative controls.
Subcutaneous tissue from the vicinity of the injection site
was collected after 48 hours, fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered
formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. After deparaffinization, sections were stained with H&E. For each
sample, large, darkly stained nuclei, indicating the presence
of inflammatory cells (13), were counted from 10 different
fields under an optical microscope at ×400 magnification.
Results were expressed as the average number of inflammatory cells per field.
Curcumin pharmacokinetics in mice
For evaluating curcumin kinetics following a single i.p. injection, mice were injected with curcumin (2.2 mg) dissolved
in 0.05 mL of a 50:50 mixture of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400
and 95% ethanol. Animals were euthanized at various time
points (n = 6 per time point), and blood samples were collected and analyzed for curcumin concentration. To determine
curcumin kinetics following multiple i.p. injections, mice
were injected with curcumin (2.2 mg) on days 0, 2, and 5.
Animals were euthanized, and tissue samples were collected
at 30 minutes (day 0) and 24, 48, 72, and 144 hours after injection (n = 6–9 per time point). To determine curcumin kinetics
following microparticle administration, mice were injected
with a single dose of curcumin-loaded microparticles in the
subcutaneous space near the neck. Microparticles (equivalent
to 29.1 mg curcumin) were dispersed in 0.5 mL PBS before
injection. Animals were euthanized at various time points
(n = 6–7 per time point), and tissue samples were analyzed
for curcumin concentration. For drug analysis, tissue samples
were homogenized in 2 mL distilled water, lyophilized, and

extracted with 2 mL diethyl ether. Blood samples were extracted with 2 mL diethyl ether without prior processing.
The ether extracts were evaporated in a water bath at 37°C
and reconstituted with 0.3 mL mobile phase. Hydroxybenzophenone was used as the internal standard. Drug concentration in the extracts was determined by liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS;
Agilent 1100, Agilent Technologies, coupled to Finnigan
TSQ Quantum Discovery Max triple quadrupole detector,
Thermo Electron). Separation was achieved on a C-18 column (Zorbax SB-18, 150 mm × 0.5 mm internal diameter,
5-μm particle size; Agilent) using a 60:40 mixture of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate (10 mmol/L, pH 4) as the
mobile phase (flow rate, 10 μL/min). Samples were analyzed in positive ion mode. Curcumin and hydroxybenzophenone were monitored using single reaction monitoring
of the 369.2 to 285.1 and 199.2 to 121.1 transitions, respectively. Retention times of hydroxybenzophenone and curcumin under these conditions were 3.8 and 4.8 minutes,
respectively. The chromatographic data were acquired
and analyzed using Xcaliber software (Thermo Scientific).
Curcumin concentrations were normalized to wet tissue
weights. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from
the blood concentration-time data based on a noncompartmental model using WinNonlin (Pharsight Corp.).
Cytotoxicity studies
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a seeding density of
5,000 per well/0.1 mL medium. Following attachment, cells
were treated with 0.1 to 50 μmol/L curcumin dissolved in
the growth medium (using 0.1% DMSO) for 72 hours. Fresh
medium containing curcumin was added every day. Cell
viability was measured using MTS assay. The formazan
product formed was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a microplate reader (ELx800, BioTek
Instruments). The mean absorbance for each treatment was
determined and then expressed as percent viability relative
to control (0.1% DMSO-treated group).
In vivo anticancer efficacy of curcumin formulations
Female BALB/c nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories)
were used in the study. Mice were randomized into four
groups of six animals each. In the first group of animals, a
single dose of curcumin-loaded microparticles (equivalent
to 58.2 mg curcumin) was injected in the subcutaneous space
near the neck a day before the injection of tumor cells. MDAMB-231 cells were suspended in HBSS (2 × 106/0.1 mL/mouse)
and injected into the fourth mammary fat pad of the mice.
The second group of animals received an equivalent dose
of blank microparticles a day before the injection of tumor
cells. In the third group of animals, the first i.p. dose of
curcumin (4.4 mg) was given a day before the injection
of tumor cells. Subsequent doses were administered thrice
a week until the end of the study. In the fourth group,
animals were injected i.p. with the vehicle thrice a week.
Tumor size was measured on alternate days throughout
the study. Length (L) and width (W) of the tumor were
measured using Vernier calipers, and the tumor volume

www.aacrjournals.org

(V) was calculated using the formula V = L × W 2/2, where
L and W are the longest and shortest diameters, respectively. Animals were euthanized at the end of the study,
and tumors were collected and frozen at −80°C.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor samples from the above study were fixed in 10%
phosphate-buffered formalin for 24 hours and subsequently
transferred to 70% ethanol before being embedded in paraffin and sectioned. After deparaffinization, sections were
stained with antibodies against CD31, Ki-67, and cleaved
caspase-3. CD31 and Ki-67 positive staining was detected with
appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody, followed by incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Vector
Laboratories) and development with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
(DAB; Dako). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's
hematoxylin (Dako). Presence of cleaved caspase-3 was detected with EnVision system (Dako), followed by development
with DAB and counterstaining with Mayer's hematoxylin.
Stained slides were evaluated under an optical microscope
at ×400 magnification. For Ki-67 and cleaved caspase-3 staining, the percent of DAB-positive cells was counted in at least
10 different fields per sample, and the results were presented
as % proliferating and % apoptotic cells, respectively. Cells in
the central necrotic region of the tumors were excluded from
analysis. For CD31 staining, DAB-positive microvessels were
counted in at least 10 different fields per sample, and the results were presented as the average number of CD31-positive
microvessels per field.
Western blotting
Tumors were cut into small pieces and incubated with
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Scientific)
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma) for 1 hour on ice. Samples were
sonicated at 3 W for 30 seconds on ice, further incubated
for 1 hour on ice, and finally centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
10 minutes at 4°C. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were analyzed by bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo
Scientific), with bovine serum albumin as the standard.
Protein samples (35–45 μg) were loaded onto 4% to 16%
SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and, after electrophoresis, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman)
using a Criterion blotter (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween
20 (TBST) for 1 hour and incubated with primary antibodies against cyclin D1, COX-2, MMP-9, VEGF, or β-tubulin,
diluted in either 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST or 5% bovine
serum albumin in TBST overnight at 4°C. After three
5-minute washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated
with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling) in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for
1 hour and then washed thrice with TBST. The transferred
proteins were then visualized using SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). For densitometric quantification, immunoblots were digitized on a
flat bed scanner and the signal intensities of the visualized
bands were quantified using Adobe Photoshop. Relative

expression was calculated by dividing the signal intensity of
each band by the signal intensity of β-tubulin band in the
corresponding lane.
Statistical analysis
Differences in tissue concentrations and cytotoxicities
were analyzed using Student's t test. Generalized linear
mixed-effect ANOVA following natural log transformation
of tumor volumes was used to analyze the tumor growth
inhibition data. The differences in the slopes of the tumor
growth curves were tested by Bonferroni adjustment. Differences in inflammatory cell populations, percent proliferating and apoptotic cells, and microvessel density were
determined using ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett's
multicomparison test. A P value of <0.05 was considered
significant.

without the presence of curcumin crystals on the surface
(Fig. 1A). Curcumin was loaded efficiently in microparticles
[38% (w/w) loading; 75% encapsulation efficiency]. In vitro,
microparticles sustained the release of curcumin over a
6-week period (Fig. 1B). A small burst release was observed in
the initial 24 hours (∼10%), followed by a relatively constant release over the remainder of the study (100% over 6 weeks).

Results

Inflammatory response to curcumin microparticles
Inflammatory cells were recognized in the H&E-stained
sections by the presence of purple-stained, distinctively
shaped nuclei (Fig. 1C). The average number of inflammatory
cells in the negative control (untreated) was 68 ± 31 per field.
Blank microparticles induced a significant inflammatory
response (208 ± 24 cells per field; P < 0.05); however, the
inflammatory response was significantly less in the presence
of curcumin microparticles (124 ± 26 cells per field; P < 0.05
versus blank microparticles).

Microparticle characterization and in vitro release of
curcumin
Optical microscopy studies indicated that microparticles
had an average diameter of 22 ± 9 μm. SEM studies indicated
that microparticles had a smooth, spherical morphology

tion (Fig. 2B). With either treatment, curcumin concentrations
in the lungs and brain were 10- to 30-fold higher than in the
blood and were sustained through 4 weeks (Fig. 2C; data not
shown for multiple i.p. dosing). Visual inspection of the injection site at the time of sacrifice indicated that microparticles
were well localized at the site of injection (data not shown).
Gross necropsy revealed no signs of acute toxicity with any
of the treatments.
Curcumin cytotoxicity
To determine a suitable in vivo tumor model for evaluating
the anticancer efficacy of curcumin microparticles, an in vitro
cytotoxicity study was conducted in different breast cancer
cell lines. As shown in Fig. 3A, curcumin did not have a significant effect on MCF-7 cells at doses <20 μmol/L and on
4T1 and EMT-6 cells at doses <10 μmol/L. Curcumin induced
significant cytotoxicity (P < 0.05) in MDA-MB-231 cells at
doses ≥0.1 μmol/L in a dose-dependent manner. Based on
these results, MDA-MB-231 cells were chosen for in vivo
tumor growth inhibition studies.

In vivo anticancer efficacy of curcumin formulations
The anticancer efficacy of curcumin treatments was evaluated in nude mice bearing orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenografts. In this tumor model, a single dose of curcumin
microparticles significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with other treatments (Fig. 3B; P < 0.05). At the end
of the study, the mean tumor volume in the curcumin microparticle–treated group was 49% lower than that in the blank
microparticle–treated group. Repeated i.p. administration of
curcumin solution had no effect on tumor growth compared
with vehicle treatment.
Curcumin downregulates markers of angiogenesis,
metastasis, and proliferation and induces apoptosis
To understand the mechanisms underlying the enhanced
anticancer efficacy of curcumin microparticles, tumors were
analyzed for biomarkers of angiogenesis (CD31 and VEGF;
refs. 14–17), metastasis (MMP-9; refs. 14, 15, 18, 19), proliferation (Ki-67 and cyclin D1; refs. 14, 15, 20), and apoptosis
(cleaved caspase-3 and COX-2; refs. 14, 15, 21). The average
microvessel density in tumors from the curcumin microparticle–
treated group (16.93 ± 2.45; Fig. 4) was significantly lower
(P < 0.05) than that in tumors from the blank microparticle–
treated group (27.73 ± 1.73). There was no significant difference in the microvessel density in tumors that received
repeated curcumin solution (24.33 ± 1.31) or the vehicle
(21.93 ± 1.19). The CD31-positive microvessels were much
smaller and less well developed in the curcumin microparticle
group than those in the other groups. Treatment with curcumin microparticles and curcumin solution decreased the

relative VEGF expression in tumors by 78% and 48%, respectively, compared with controls (Fig. 5). There were 57% and
11% reductions in the relative MMP-9 expression in tumors
from curcumin microparticle– and curcumin solution–
treated groups, respectively, compared with controls (Fig. 5).
Curcumin microparticle treatment reduced the number of
proliferating cells by 45% (Fig. 4; P < 0.05) and the relative
cyclin D1 expression by 52% (Fig. 5) compared with blank
microsphere treatment. Curcumin microparticle treatment
also resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells relative to that with blank microparticle treatment
(Fig. 4). Repeated curcumin dosing had no effect on tumor
cell proliferation, apoptosis, or the relative cyclin D1 expression compared with vehicle treatment (Figs. 4 and 5).
There was a 1.5-fold decrease in the relative COX-2 expression in tumors from curcumin microparticle– and curcumin
solution–treated groups compared with the respective controls (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Poor oral bioavailability of curcumin and other naturally
occurring chemopreventive agents often limits their usefulness as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents
(3, 22, 23). In a phase I clinical trial, oral consumption of 3.6
g curcumin daily resulted in a low nanomolar (11.1 nmol/L)
plasma concentration (7). Other clinical studies confirm the
low bioavailability of orally administered curcumin (6, 8).
Minimally invasive strategies that can provide effective and

sustained tissue concentrations of curcumin will help translate the preclinical efficacy of curcumin to the clinic. The
goal of this study was to investigate the use of a sustained
release microparticle formulation of curcumin as a novel approach to chemoprevention.
PLGA polymer was selected for the fabrication of curcumin microparticles because of its safety profile, biodegradability, and sustained release properties. PLGA microparticles
are currently approved for use in other indications. Microparticles entrapping a synthetic peptide analogue of luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone, Zoladex (AstraZeneca), have
been approved for the palliative treatment of prostate and
breast cancer (24). Similarly, microparticles containing a synthetic decapeptide analogue of luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone, Trelstar Depot (Watson), are used for the palliative
treatment of advanced prostate cancer (25). An important
feature of PLGA microparticles is that the duration of drug
release can be varied from a few days to several months
(26–28). This allows for infrequent, patient-friendly dosing regimens. The current study showed that PLGA microparticles
can efficiently encapsulate curcumin and sustain its release
for several weeks.
An important concern with PLGA microparticles is the inflammatory response often observed at the site of injection
(13, 29). Degradation products of PLGA are lactic and glycolic
acids and their soluble oligomers (30). These byproducts
cause local acidity and inflammation, which can affect drug
absorption from the injection site (31). In the current studies,
blank PLGA microparticles caused a significant inflammatory
response as expected. However, the response was significantly
diminished by the presence of curcumin in microparticles.
Curcumin has been shown to reduce inflammation by inhibiting a number of inflammatory mediators (32). Curcumin can
modulate arachidonic acid metabolism at several targets, including inhibition of phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, inhibition of COX-2 protein expression and catalytic
activity (although weakly), and inhibition of lipooxygenase

activity (33). Curcumin can bind to the active site of lipooxygenase, inhibit the enzyme activity competitively, and become
oxygenated (34). Similarly, curcumin is a weak scavenger of
nitric oxide (35). The current study evaluated the inflammatory response at a single time point (48 h) following microparticle administration. Although previous studies have
shown that peak response occurs over this time period
(13, 29), a more detailed study evaluating the response over
a longer duration is needed to further characterize the inflammatory response to curcumin microparticles.
Pharmacokinetic studies were done to establish the blood
concentrations achievable with the different formulations.
The doses used in this study were selected based on previously published reports. For example, Khor and colleagues
(36) investigated thrice a week i.p. administration of curcumin solution (6 μmol; equivalent to 2.2 mg curcumin per
dose), which was moderately effective in inhibiting the
growth of a prostate tumor xenograft. We used the same
dose and dosing schedule to evaluate curcumin blood concentrations after repeated i.p. administration. For microparticles, the relationship between clearance (CL), rate of drug
input (R0), and steady-state plasma concentration (Css = R0/CL)
was used to calculate the drug release rate required to achieve
a target plasma concentration of ∼1 μmol/L. The above relationship assumes a constant (zero-order) drug input. Although
the drug release rate from PLGA microparticles is usually
not zero-order (37), in vitro release studies show that constant
rate input is a reasonable assumption in this case. Clearance
was estimated using pharmacokinetic data from the single i.p.
dose study. Blood levels of curcumin were sustained for
4 weeks following a single dose of curcumin microparticles,
which confirmed that microparticles controlled curcumin release in vivo. However, the blood levels were lower than the
estimated 1 μmol/L concentration. It is possible that drug
release from PLGA microparticles was slower in vivo than
in vitro (38). Interestingly, curcumin concentrations in the
lungs and brain were significantly higher than the blood

concentrations. The lungs and brain are common sites of
metastases in breast cancer patients (39, 40). Curcumin microparticle treatment also reduced the expression of MMP-9, an
enzyme that degrades extracellular matrix and a marker for
metastasis (14, 18, 19). Although not investigated here, the
above observations suggest that curcumin microparticles
could be highly effective against breast cancer metastases. Tissue levels at time points beyond 4 weeks were not determined,
as curcumin concentrations (especially in the blood) were expected to be below the detection limit of the analytic technique.
Based on the magnitude of tissue concentrations achieved
with curcumin microparticles and the results of the cytotoxicity study in different cell lines, MDA-MB-231 cells were selected for the in vivo efficacy studies. The tumor growth inhibition
study showed the anticancer efficacy of curcumin microparticles. Antitumor effect of curcumin has been linked to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis
(36, 41). COX-2 plays an important role in promoting tumor
cell proliferation and in suppressing apoptosis (42). Curcumin
has been shown to reduce COX-2 expression through downregulation of NF-κB activation (43). Cyclin D1, a component
subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK6, is
rate-limiting factor in the progression of cells through the first
gap (G1) phase of the cell cycle (44). Curcumin suppresses
cyclin D1 expression through downregulation of NF-κB activation (45, 46). In addition, curcumin induces apoptosis through
downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, upregulation of Bax and
Bad, induction of cytochrome c release, activation of cleaved
caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(47, 48). Correlating with enhanced inhibition of tumor
growth, curcumin microparticle treatment resulted in downregulation of markers of cell proliferation and in greater
induction of apoptosis compared with other groups.
Treatment with curcumin microparticles had a significant
effect on tumor angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown
that curcumin suppresses NF-κB–induced VEGF expression,
resulting in decreased angiogenesis (49). Although there is
currently no evidence in the literature, it is possible that curcumin also interacts with VEGF physicochemically to inhibit
its binding to its receptor. CD31, an adhesion molecule expressed by microvascular endothelial cells, has been used as
a biomarker of tumor angiogenesis (16, 17). Treatment with curcumin microparticles resulted in fewer and less well-developed
CD31-positive microvessels compared with a large number of
darkly stained and intact vessels in other groups. VEGF expression in the curcumin microparticle–treated group was
also lower than that in the other groups, which correlates well
with diminished angiogenesis observed in this group.
It was surprising to note that, despite resulting in high tissue concentrations, repeated i.p. dosing was not effective in
inhibiting tumor growth. It is possible that continuous exposure to low concentrations of curcumin following microparticle

treatment may elicit certain pharmacologic effects, which
are not observed after repeated i.p. dosing of curcumin solution. Similar variability in therapeutic response, depending
on the dose and the kinetics of drug exposure, has been observed for curcumin and other drugs. Kang and colleagues
(50) reported a significant decrease in the cellular reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels in human hepatoma Hep3B cells
treated with low doses (10–20 μmol/L) of curcumin. At higher doses, however, curcumin induced a significant increase
in the ROS levels. Similarly, Kawai and colleagues (51) noted
that whereas prolonged exposure of vascular smooth muscle
cells to glucocorticoids resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, pulsatile exposure resulted in a proliferative effect.
Previous reports also describe the concept of “metronomic
chemotherapy,” in which regular, low-dose chemotherapy
results in tumor growth suppression through inhibition of
angiogenesis (52, 53). This is different from conventional
high-dose, cyclical chemotherapy, which results in direct killing of cancer cells. Based on the sustained, near-constant
blood levels of curcumin achieved with microparticles compared with the peaks and troughs observed with repeated i.p.
dosing and the significant inhibition of angiogenesis observed only with microparticles, a case could be made for
“metronomic chemoprevention” with microparticles. Further
studies are needed to test this possibility.
In conclusion, a single dose of curcumin microparticles resulted in sustained systemic availability of curcumin and inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts. Repeated i.p.
dosing resulted in peaks and troughs in curcumin blood concentrations and was not effective in inhibiting tumor growth.
Injectable sustained release formulations may provide a
novel, patient-friendly, and clinically translatable approach
to cancer chemoprevention.
