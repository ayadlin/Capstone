Abstract
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) expand in tumor-bearing hosts and play a central role in cancer
immune evasion by inhibiting adaptive and innate immunity. They therefore represent a major obstacle for
successful cancer immunotherapy. Different strategies have thus been explored to deplete and/or inactivate
MDSC in vivo. Using a murine mammary cancer model, we demonstrated that doxorubicin selectively eliminates
MDSC in the spleen, blood, and tumor beds. Furthermore, residual MDSC from doxorubicin-treated mice
exhibited impaired suppressive function. Importantly, the frequency of CD4þ and CD8þ T lymphocytes and
consequently the effector lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) to suppressive MDSC ratios were signiﬁcantly
increased following doxorubicin treatment of tumor-bearing mice. In addition, the proportion of NK and
cytotoxic T cell (CTL) expressing perforin and granzyme B and of CTL producing IFN-g was augmented by
doxorubicin administration. Of therapeutic relevance, this drug efﬁciently combined with Th1 or Th17 lymphocytes to suppress tumor development and metastatic disease. MDSC isolated from patients with different types of
cancer were also sensitive to doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. These results thus indicate that
doxorubicin may be used not only as a direct cytotoxic drug against tumor cells, but also as a potent
immunomodulatory agent that selectively impairs MDSC-induced immunosuppression, thereby fostering the
efﬁcacy of T-cell–based immunotherapy. Cancer Res; 74(1); 104–18. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have been
described as a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that, in different pathological conditions, are
impaired in their ability to terminally differentiate into
mature myeloid lineages such as macrophages, dendritic
cells, or granulocytes (1, 2). MDSC are functionally deﬁned
by their capability to inhibit both innate and adaptive immunity. They are potent suppressors of T-cell proliferation and
activation in humans and mice (1–4). Phenotypically, mouse
MDSC express the markers Gr-1 and CD11b. Two main
populations have been described in mice based on the
relative expression of 2 epitopes of Gr-1 (Ly6G and/or Ly6C):

granulocytic MDSC are CD11bþLy6GþLy6Clow, whereas
monocytic MDSC are CD11bþLy6GLy6Chigh (5, 6). In human,
MDSC are generally identiﬁed as CD14 CD33þCD11bþHLADRneg/low cells (6). The immunosuppressive function of
MDSC depends on multiple mechanisms, including the production of nitric oxide, peroxynitrites, reactive oxygen species
(ROS), and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and/or arginase-1
(5, 7, 8).
A substantial expansion of MDSC in the blood, lymph
nodes, bone marrow, and spleen has been detected in multiple mouse cancer models (5, 9). Similarly, accumulation of
MDSC has been reported in the blood, lymph nodes, and
tumors of patients with various types of cancers, including
breast, which correlates with tumor burden and disease stage
(10). Tumor-induced MDSC expansion signiﬁcantly contributes to the mechanisms of cancer-induced immune suppression, and therefore signiﬁcantly impedes the efﬁcacy of
immunotherapeutic approaches (1, 11, 12). Not surprisingly,
multiple reports in humans and animal models have indicated that MDSC elimination or inhibition promotes antitumor immunity and enhances the response to immunotherapy (11). Different approaches have thus been explored to
target these cells, which include the use of speciﬁc antibodies
(13), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; refs. 14–16), or chemotherapeutic molecules such as gemcitabine (17, 18), 5-ﬂuorouracile (5-FU; ref. 19), or docetaxel (20).

Doxorubicin Eliminates MDSC

Doxorubicin is an antineoplastic drug broadly used in the
treatment of hematological malignancies, soft tissue sarcomas,
and several types of carcinomas including breast cancer (21).
Extensive evidence has been provided that besides its direct
tumoricidal activity, doxorubicin also promotes antitumor
immunity (22–26). This drug has indeed been shown to
induce an "immunogenic type" of tumor cell death leading
to the stimulation of dendritic cell antigen-presenting function (23). Doxorubicin administration has also been reported
to enhance the proliferation of tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells
(27), and to increase the permeability of tumor cells to
granzyme B produced by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL;
ref. 28). However, whether this drug may impact tumorinduced immunosuppression, speciﬁcally by negatively targeting MDSC, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated
the effects of doxorubicin on MDSC in the murine breast
cancer model 4T1 and explored the possibility of combining
this chemotherapeutic drug with immunotherapy. We demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that doxorubicin eliminated
MDSC by triggering apoptosis of these cells. ROS may
contribute to doxorubicin-mediated elimination of MDSC.
In addition, residual MDSC from doxorubicin-treated mice
were impaired in their suppressive function. Of importance,
doxorubicin administration led to improved T- and natural
killer cell function. The proportion of T- and natural killer
(NK) cells expressing perforin and granzyme B was indeed
signiﬁcantly augmented following treatment of tumor-bearing mice with doxorubicin. In addition, doxorubicin
increased the proliferation status of T lymphocytes and
NK cells. Substantiating these observations, doxorubicin
exhibited selective cytotoxic effects on MDSC isolated
from patients with cancer. Furthermore, the combination
of doxorubicin with T helper (Th) 1 or with recently identiﬁed Th17 lymphocytes impaired tumor development and
metastatic spreading. These ﬁndings therefore highlight a
novel property of doxorubicin as a potent selective MDSCtargeting agent, which may be used to enhance the efﬁcacy
of immunotherapeutic regimens.

Patients and Methods
Patients
A total of n ¼ 10 patients with conﬁrmed solid cancers
(2 patients with lung, one patient with ovarian, one patient
with prostate, one patient with bladder, one patient with colon,
one patient with stomach, one patient with kidney, one patient
with pancreatic, and one patient with breast cancer) were
enrolled in the study before treatment after giving written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the
University Hospital of Dijon. None of the patients had received
chemotherapy or any other immunosuppressive treatment
during the previous 3 months.
Animals and tumor cell lines
Six- to eight-week-old Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice were
purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Six- to
eight-week-old gp91phox/ (C57Bl6-Cybbtm1Din) were pur-

www.aacrjournals.org

chased from Jackson Laboratory. The mice were housed and
cared for according to the University of Arizona Institutional
Animal and Care Guidelines and Use Committee (IACUC).
The 4T1 and EMT6 murine mammary tumor cell lines
(Balb/c origin) and the EL4 thymoma cell line (C57BL/6
origin) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. 4T1-luc was generated using luciferase reporter
plasmid (PGL4-51; InvivoGen). Brieﬂy, the transfection was
performed using Fugene6 reagent (Promega) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected cells were
clonally selected in presence of G418 (800 mg/mL) and
luciferase expression was conﬁrmed using the luciferase
reporter assay system and a luminometer (Femtomaster
FB12; Berthold Detection System), according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega).
Bioluminescence imaging
Tumor-bearing animals were injected (i.p.) with D-luciferin
(4.29 mg/mouse; Xenogen). Mice were anesthetized using
isoﬂurane (1.5 L/min oxygen, 4% isoﬂurane) and kept in an
induction chamber. Images were captured with an AMI1000
imager (Spectral Instruments Imaging). Light emission was
measured over an integration time of 1 minute, 10 minutes
after injection of luciferin. Luciferase activity was analyzed
using the AMI1000 Software (Spectral Instruments Imaging) to
quantify tumor region ﬂux (photons per second) and to assess
tumor growth.
Generation of Th1 and Th17
Naive CD4þCD25CD62Lþ T lymphocytes were isolated
from the spleen of 6- to 8-week-old Balb/c mice according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were
subsequently cultured at a concentration of 106 cells/mL in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL
penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate, 0.5  MEM nonessential amino acids, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Cells
were stimulated with anti-CD3– and anti-CD28–coated beads
(Invitrogen). Th1 cells were generated in the presence of
interleukin (IL)-12 (10 ng/mL), IL-2 (10 ng/mL), IL-7 (20
ng/mL), and blocking anti-IL-4 antibodies (5 mg/mL; 3-day
culture). For the generation of Th17 cells, naive T cells were
cultured with IL-6 (40 ng/mL), TGF-b (0.5 ng/mL), blocking
anti-IFN-g (5 mg/mL), and anti-IL-4 (5 mg/mL) antibodies for
3 days. Th17 cultures were then prolonged in fresh medium
containing IL-23 (40 ng/mL) for an additional 3 days. All
cytokines were purchased from R&D Systems or Peprotech.
Chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy
4T1 or 4T1-Luc cells were injected (1  106 cells) orthotopically (mammary fat pad). In some experiments, 7 and 12 days
posttumor injection, mice were administered with doxorubicin (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, i.v.), cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg, i.p.),
ﬂudarabine (50 mg/kg, i.p.), melphalan (5 mg/kg, i.p.), vincristine (1 mg/kg, i.v.), etoposide (5 mg/kg, i.p.), or control PBS.
Spleens, blood, and tumors were collected 14, 17, and 23 days
posttumor cell injection. For evaluating the effects of doxorubicin plus T helper lymphocyte combination therapy, mice
were injected with doxorubicin (5 mg/kg) on days 7 and 12 and

with Th1 or Th17 cells (1  106 i.v.; 2  106 intratumorally) on
days 9 and 14 posttumor cell injection. Mice were euthanized
for ethical reasons when they exhibited severe morbidity signs
because of overwhelming metastatic spreading (endpoint at 4–
4.5 weeks) in compliance with IACUC regulations.
MDSC isolation
Spleens were harvested, dissociated, and red blood cells
were lysed in lysis buffer (BD Biosciences). MDSC were puriﬁed
using a mouse MDSC isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). The puriﬁed cells were
used in other experiments.
Flow cytometry analysis
Cell suspensions from blood, spleens, or tumors were ﬁltered and red blood cells were lysed. For extracellular staining,
cells were incubated with the indicated combinations of antibodies (CD11b, Ly6C, Ly6G (Gr-1), CD8, CD49b, CD4, CD25, F4/
80, CD11c, CCR7, and CD206) or isotype controls (1 hour, 4 C).
For intracellular staining, cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized
immediately after cell surface staining according to the manufacturer's description (Affymetrix eBioscience). For IFN-g
staining, cells were incubated with a leukocyte stimulating kit
(BD Biosciences) for 4 hours. For perforin or granzyme B
staining, cells were incubated with anti-CD3– and antiCD28–coated beads (Invitrogen) and IL-2 (4 ng/mL) for 24
hours. The proliferation status of the cells was assessed by
staining with Ki67 according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Ki67 detection protocol; BD Biosciences). All antibodies and
isotype controls were purchased from BD Biosciences or
Affymetrix eBioscience. For the detection of apoptosis, spleen,
and blood samples from tumor-bearing mice, untreated or
treated with doxorubicin, were dissociated and processed as
described earlier. Cells were then stained with Annexin V and
propodium iodide (PI), according to the manufacturer's protocol (Apoptosis detection kit; Affymetrix eBioscience). Fluorescence data were collected on a FACSverse or LSRFortessa
(BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree star Inc.).
Suppression assays
Spleens from naive mice were collected, dissociated, and
cells were incubating on nylon wool columns (37 C, 45
minutes) after red blood cell lysis. More than 90% of the
eluted cells were T lymphocytes based on T-cell receptor
(TCR)ab expression. These T cells were labeled with 5
mmol/L CellTrace Violet according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Invitrogen) and were plated in 96-well plates
with anti-CD3– and anti-CD28–coated activation beads
(Invitrogen). Isolated MDSC from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice,
treated or not with doxorubicin, were then added to the
culture (MDSC-to-T-cell ratio ¼ 1:2). After 4 days, cells were
harvested, stained with anti-CD4, anti-CD8, and anti-CD25
(Affymetrix eBioscience). Cell proliferation was determined
by measuring the dilution of cell trace violet by ﬂow cytometry after gating on the CD4þ or CD8þ cell populations.
The proliferation index was determined using the Modﬁt
software (Verity Software House) and percent proliferation

106

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

was calculated as follows: proliferation (%) ¼ (Tþ  T) 
(S  T)/(Tþ  T)  100, with Tþ is the proliferation index of
the control stimulated T cells without MDSC; T is the
proliferation index of control nonstimulated T cells without
MDSC; and S is the proliferation index of stimulated T cells
in the presence of MDSC).
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and sonicated. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at
14,000 rpm and protein concentration was determined
with the Thermo Scientiﬁc BCA protein assay using bovine
serum albumin (BSA) as standard. Equal amounts of proteins (30 mg) were separated on 10% or 16% SDS-PAGE gels,
transferred onto a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) and probed with primary Abs speciﬁc for
P-STAT3, STAT3, Arginase-1, IDO, cleaved caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling Company), S100A9, S100A8 (R&D Systems), and
actin (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Reactive bands were visualized by
exposure to ﬁlm using Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
ROS detection
Splenocytes from untreated or doxorubicin-treated mice
were incubated for 30 minutes with the oxidation-sensitive
dye dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFDA; 5 mmol/L;
Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Samples were then labeled with
anti-Gr-1 and anti-CD11b antibodies. The level of ROS was
detected using ﬂow cytometry as described (29).
Real-time PCR
Cells were collected and total RNA was isolated using
TRIzol (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were set up in 96-well
plates containing 10 mL 2 IQ Supermix (Bio-Rad), 1 mL
TaqMan primer/probe set (ABI), 2 mL of the cDNA synthesis
reaction [10% of room temperature (RT) reaction] and 7 mL
of nuclease-free water. Reactions were run and analyzed on
a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System.
Primers for IFN-g and IL-17 were obtained from Applied
Biosystems (Invitrogen).
ELISA
IL-17 and IFN-g concentration was detected in Th1- and
Th17-cell culture supernatant using ELISA according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix eBioscience).
Immunoﬂuorescent staining
Tumors and spleens were harvested and frozen. Serial
sections (5 mm) were performed from each tissue and
mounted. Frozen slides were ﬁrst ﬁxed in 100% cold methanol
for 10 minutes. After blocking for 1 hour at RT [10% normal
chicken serum in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST)/1% BSA] slides were incubated (overnight, 4 C) with antiGr-1 (Affymetrix eBioscience; 0.02 mg/mL in TBS-T). Slides
were washed with TBS-T and incubated with a secondary
chicken anti-rat antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647
for 45 minutes at RT (1:200 in TBST; Invitrogen). Slides

were washed and incubated (2 hours, RT) with a rat antimouse CD11b antibody conjugated with FITC (Affymetrix
eBioscience; 0.02 mg/mL in TBS-T). Nuclear counterstaining
was performed using Sytox orange according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Slides were mounted with
ﬂuorescence mounting medium (Dako North America) and
visualized using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510-META
NLO).
Statistical analysis
Experiments were performed with 4 to 8 mice per groups as
indicated. Mice were individually processed and analyzed
separately unless speciﬁed otherwise. All analyses were carried
out using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software).
Analyses were performed by 1- or 2-way ANOVA with a
Bonferroni or Dunnett posttest, or a paired t test where
appropriate. Statistically signiﬁcant P values were labeled as
follows:  , P < 0.001;  , P < 0.01; and  , P < 0.05.

Results
Doxorubicin selectively eliminates tumor-induced MDSC
in mice bearing established 4T1 mammary tumors
The immunomodulatory effects of doxorubicin have been
extensively studied (23, 26). However, the possible impact of
this chemotherapeutic agent on suppressive MDSC remains
elusive. To address this question, Balb/c mice were injected
with 4T1 breast cancer cells and treated with doxorubicin
(2.5 and 5 mg/kg; noncurative doses), 7 and 12 days posttumor implantation (Fig. 1A). We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that 4T1
tumor growth is associated with substantial MDSC expansion and determined the basal proportion of MDSC in the
absence of doxorubicin therapy at different time points
following injection of tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S1;
refs. 30 and 31). Doxorubicin signiﬁcantly reduced the
proportion and absolute number of 4T1 tumor-induced
MDSC in the spleen (Fig. 1B and C) and blood (Fig. 1D) of
treated animals. It is noteworthy that although doxorubicinmediated elimination of MDSC was prominent on day 14
and 17 posttumor cell injection, these cells were reconstituted by day 23. These results were further conﬁrmed by
confocal microscopy analysis of spleen sections (Fig. 1E).
Furthermore, MDSC were also depleted within the tumor
beds in mice treated with doxorubicin (Supplementary Figs.
S2A–S2C). 4T1 tumor development is primarily associated
with the expansion of granulocytic MDSC (30, 32). Our
results indicate that doxorubicin did not signiﬁcantly affect
monocytic MDSC, which were low in frequency even in
untreated animals, but signiﬁcantly depleted granulocytic
MDSC (Supplementary Fig. S2D). These results thus demonstrate that doxorubicin induced elimination of tumorinduced MDSC.
Doxorubicin minimally affects effector immune cell
populations
To optimally promote antitumor immunity, immunomodulatory drugs should negatively target immunosuppressive
cells while sparing immune effectors. We therefore sought to

www.aacrjournals.org

investigate whether doxorubicin may affect other immune
cells, speciﬁcally antitumoral effector T lymphocytes and
natural killer cells. Interestingly, the proportion of CD4þ and
CD8þ T lymphocytes was signiﬁcantly increased in the
spleen and blood of doxorubicin-treated mice (Fig. 2A and
B). NK frequency increased in the blood and was not altered
in the spleen of the treated animals (Fig. 2C). Consistent
with these results, the proliferation status of CD4þ and CD8þ
T cells was augmented in doxorubicin-treated animals
(Fig. 2D). This preferential targeting of MDSC resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase in the ratios of effector CD8þ T, CD4þ T,
or NK cells to suppressive MDSC (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Importantly, the proportion of NK cells and CD8þ T lymphocytes expressing perforin and granzyme B was signiﬁcantly increased in doxorubicin-treated 4T1 tumor-bearing
mice (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S3B). In line with these
results, doxorubicin administration resulted in augmented
frequency of IFN-g–producing CD8þ T lymphocytes (Fig. 2F).
However, no change in the proportion of IFN-g–producing
CD4þ T cells was observed (Fig. 2F). It is noteworthy that
doxorubicin did not change immunosuppressive Treg frequency (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Together these results
indicate that doxorubicin-mediated MDSC depletion was
associated with augmented effector immune cell proliferation and function.
Importantly, we further determined that doxorubicin was
signiﬁcantly more potent at depleting MDSC than other
chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide, ﬂudarabine, melphalan (Supplementary Fig. S4A), vincristine, or
etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S4B), which exhibited limited
effects on these cells. Of note, these drugs promoted a
decrease in tumor volume similar to that induced by doxorubicin. Doxorubicin was also unique at substantially
increasing the effector lymphocytes (or NK) to suppressor
MDSC ratios, indicating that it is endowed with a higher
degree of selectivity compared with these other drugs (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). Furthermore, even in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin signiﬁcantly
triggered MDSC elimination and increased T lymphocyte
frequency (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
The observations that doxorubicin reduces MDSC frequency and absolute number and increases effector lymphocyte proportion, resulting in an increased effector T cells to
suppressor MDSC ratios, were further conﬁrmed in the EL4
(thymoma) and EMT6 (breast cancer) mouse models (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). In addition, residual MDSC
isolated from EL4 or EMT6 tumor-bearing mice treated with
doxorubicin exhibited reduced suppressive function (data
not shown).
Doxorubicin preferentially triggers MDSC apoptotic
program
We next investigated the mechanisms underlying doxorubicin-mediated elimination of MDSC and speciﬁcally
explored whether this drug may trigger the MDSC apoptotic
program. Flow cytometry analysis after staining of spleen
cells with anti-Gr-1, anti-CD11b antibodies, Annexin V and
PI, and gating on the Gr-1þCD11bþ population indicated

Doxorubicin impedes the suppressive activity of residual
MDSC isolated from tumor-bearing mice
A cardinal characteristic of MDSC is their ability to
suppress the activation and proliferation of T cells. MDSC
depletion by doxorubicin was not complete as 15%
of residual MDSC could still be detected 17 days after
doxorubicin administration. Therefore, it was important
to determine whether the suppressive function of these
remaining MDSC was affected by doxorubicin. As expected and previously reported (32), MDSC isolated from
untreated tumor-bearing mice signiﬁcantly inhibited T
lymphocyte (CD4þ and CD8þ) proliferation (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. S6) and activation (Fig. 4B). The
suppressive function of residual MDSC isolated from
doxorubicin-treated tumor-bearing animals was signiﬁcantly impaired (Fig. 4A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S6). Exposure of MDSC isolated from untreated 4T1
tumor-bearing mice to noncytotoxic concentration of

www.aacrjournals.org

doxorubicin in vitro impaired their immunosuppressive
function (Fig. 4C).
Various mechanisms have been implicated in MSDC suppressive function including the production of ROS or the
expression of arginase-1 or IDO involved in the catabolism of
arginine or tryptophan, respectively (1). Depletion of these
amino acids from the microenvironment results in the inhibition of T-cell proliferation, notably through the downregulation of the z-chain of the TCR complex (1, 11). Similarly,
ROS exhibit suppressive effects on T lymphocytes (1, 33).
Five days after doxorubicin treatment of 4T1 tumor-bearing
mice, the production of ROS (Fig. 5A) and the expression of
arginase-1 (Fig. 5B) and IDO (Fig. 5C) by residual MDSC
was impaired. Additional molecules reported for their role
in MDSC development and/or immunosuppressive function
such as CD73, CD39, S100A8/9, or STAT-3 were not significantly altered by doxorubicin treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S7A and S7B).

Previous reports have indicated that some chemotherapeutic drugs such as docetaxel can promote MDSC differentiation into macrophages (M1; ref. 20). To evaluate
this possibility, MDSC from doxorubicin-treated mice were
analyzed for the expression of markers expressed by M1
(CCR7) or M2 (CD206; Mannose Receptor) macrophages.
The expression of these 2 cell surface markers was not
detected on MDSC following doxorubicin treatment, indicating that this drug did not promote MDSC differentiation

into macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Finally, further
investigation indicated that the proliferation status (Ki67
expression) of residual 4T1 tumor-induced MDSC was
reduced by doxorubicin therapy (not shown).
Altogether, these results indicate that 5 days after doxorubicin administration, MDSC that have not been eliminated
by the drug exhibited reduced expression of arginase-1 and
IDO, decreased ROS level, and curtailed immunosuppressive
activity.

Doxorubicin Eliminates MDSC

Doxorubicin acts synergistically with Th1 or Th17 cell
therapy
Doxorubicin depleted tumor-induced MDSC and curtailed
the suppressive function of residual MDSC, thereby averting
one major mechanism of cancer-mediated immunosuppression. Moreover, the proliferation status and activation of
responder effector lymphocytes and NK were restored in
doxorubicin-treated mice. We therefore reasoned that this
drug may create a favorable environment that may allow for
successful combinatory immunotherapy. To address this
hypothesis, we evaluated a chemo-immunotherapy regimen
consisting of doxorubicin followed by infusion of T helper
lymphocytes.
Th17 lymphocytes represent a recently described subset
of T helper cells with controversial effects on tumor development. Recent reports have demonstrated that Th17 generated in vitro have the potential to promote the development of CD8þ T lymphocyte-dependent immune response
and to impair tumor growth (34). Th1 can also promote
antitumor immunity (35). In our current study, mice bearing established 4T1 tumors were treated with doxorubicin
and received either Th1 or Th17 lymphocytes generated
in vitro from naive CD4þ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A
and S8B) as depicted in Fig. 6A. The chemoimmunotherapeutic regimen signiﬁcantly reduced the number of 4T1
metastatic nodules in the lungs and impaired tumor growth
when compared with the monotherapies (Fig. 6B and
Supplementary Fig. S8C). Importantly, MDSC depletion
persisted in mice treated with doxorubicin plus Th1 or
Th17 cells, whereas these cells eventually re-expanded posttreatment in mice receiving doxorubicin alone (Fig. 6C
and D). Consistent with these results, the frequency of
CD8þ and CD4þ T lymphocytes was signiﬁcantly increased
in doxorubicin plus Th1- or Th17-treated animals (Fig. 6D),
but NK proportion remained unchanged (data not
shown). These data thus indicate that doxorubicin administration resulted in the promotion of a favorable environment fostering the antitumoral efﬁcacy of Th1 and Th17
lymphocytes.

Doxorubicin induces apoptosis of MDSC isolated from
patients with cancer
To determine whether similar effects of doxorubicin can be
observed on human MDSC, CD33þ cells were isolated from the
blood of patients with different types of cancer (n ¼ 10). CD33þ
cells exhibited a phenotype consistent with that reported for
human MDSC (Fig. 7A; ref. 36) and importantly were endowed
with signiﬁcant suppressive capabilities (Fig. 7B). Our results
indicate that these immunosuppressive cells were sensitive to
doxorubicin-induced cell death (Fig. 7C and E). Importantly,
CD33 depleted cells (CD33) from the same patients were
signiﬁcantly less sensitive to doxorubicin (Fig. 7D and E),
indicating that this chemotherapeutic molecule preferentially
targets MDSC. CD3þ T cells were also minimally affected by
doxorubicin (not shown). These results thus suggest that
doxorubicin exhibit effects on human MDSC comparable to
those observed on mouse MDSC, thus supporting the imple-

mentation of this drug in clinical chemoimmunotherapeutic
approaches.

Discussion
The development of malignant tumors is commonly associated with the occurrence and persistence of an immunosuppressive environment. The expansion of MDSC, a main
suppressive cell population (13), has been widely documented in many animal tumor models as well as in patients with
different types of cancers and represents a major obstacle
for efﬁcient cancer immunotherapy (5, 9, 10). Several strategies have been explored to either eliminate or curtail, the
immunosuppressive function of MDSC. Depletion of Gr-1þ
MDSC using anti-Gr-1 monoclonal antibody resulted in
restored T-cell antitumor activity. However, anti-Gr-1 also
led to the elimination of mature granulocytes and was
associated with severe immunosuppression (13). The promotion of MDSC differentiation using ATRA, a natural
metabolite of vitamin A, has also been considered. ATRA
administration enhanced T lymphocyte function and fostered the efﬁcacy of cancer vaccines (14). In recent years,
evidence has been provided that chemotherapeutic drugs
can not only kill tumor cells, but also enhance antitumor
immunity through different mechanisms (37). Chemotherapeutic agents can promote the function of antigen presenting cells, NK, and T lymphocytes (23, 26, 37) but may also
negatively target immunosuppressive cells such as Treg or
MDSC (17, 19, 20, 38, 39). For instance, gemcitabine has been
reported to deplete MDSC in tumor-bearing mice, resulting
in enhanced antitumor immunity (17–20). Additional
reports have demonstrated that 5-Fluorouracil (19), or docetaxel (20), can eliminate, impede the suppressive function,
or promote the differentiation of MDSC.
Doxorubicin has been a key chemotherapeutic agent used
against a variety of human cancers. More recently, this drug has
been widely studied for its ability to modulate anticancer
immunity (23–26, 28). Reports have demonstrated that doxorubicin induces an "immunogenic type" of tumor cell death
and promotes antitumor immune responses (23). In this study,
we highlight a novel property of doxorubicin: its ability to
avert a major mechanism of tumor-induced immunosuppression by eliminating and inactivating tumor-induced MDSC.
We established that doxorubicin administration reduced the
number of MDSC in the spleen, blood, and in the tumor beds of
animals bearing established 4T1 mammary tumors. Importantly, doxorubicin selectively eliminated MDSC while enhancing the proliferation status, activation, cytokine production of
effector T lymphocytes and/or NK cells. This primary targeting
of MDSC while effector T cells (and NK) were spared translated
into a substantial increase in effector lymphocytes to MDSC
ratios. Compared with the other chemotherapeutic drugs that
we evaluated, doxorubicin was endowed with the highest
degree of selectivity. Indeed, although associated with a reduction of tumor volume comparable to that observed after
doxorubicin treatment, most of these other agents had limited
effects on MDSC and some of them, such as cyclophosphamide,
even led to a slight increase in MDSC as they targeted T cells.

Of therapeutic relevance, the addition of doxorubicin to cyclophosphamide resulted in a signiﬁcant elimination of MDSC
similar to that observed when doxorubicin was administered
alone. This peculiar property of doxorubicin further highlights the interest and advantage of using this drug as a
potent immunomodulatory agent in chemoimmunotherapeutic approaches.
Further investigation indicated that doxorubicin selectively
triggered the apoptotic program of MDSC. No change in the
apoptosis rate of T or NK cells was detected post-doxorubicin
treatment compared with untreated groups. This selective
effect may be partly explained by the preferential targeting of
highly proliferative cells by doxorubicin. Indeed, MDSC in
untreated tumor-bearing mice expressed high level of Ki67,
a marker of cell proliferation (data not shown), whereas T
lymphocyte proliferation was low in untreated tumor-bearing
mice. The triggering of apoptosis by doxorubicin through the
induction of ROS production has been described in tumor and
normal cells such as cardiomyocytes (40). In vitro, the ROS
scavenger NAC impaired doxorubicin-mediated elimination of
MDSC, and MDSC isolated from gp91/ mice were less
sensitive to doxorubicin. The effects of doxorubicin on MDSC
were partially impaired in EL4 tumor-bearing gp91/ mice.
These results strongly suggest that, early after its administration, doxorubicin may induce ROS-dependent triggering of the
MDSC apoptotic program, resulting in the rapid elimination of
most of these cells. Of note, MDSC that were not eliminated
and that were found later (5 days) after doxorubicin treatment
exhibited an overall impaired suppressive activity, which, at
this time was associated with a reduction of ROS production.
A previous report has indicated that docetaxel reduced
MDSC number by promoting their differentiation into M1
macrophages (20). We did not detect any changes in the
expression of M1 or M2 macrophage markers on MDSC
following doxorubicin treatment. In addition, no change in
the frequency of macrophages or DC was detected in the
treated mice. However, as mentioned earlier, the suppressive
function of the limited number of residual MDSC that were not
depleted by doxorubicin was signiﬁcantly impaired.
Because doxorubicin administration induced MDSC depletion and was associated with restored T lymphocyte activity,
we reasoned that it may create a favorable environment for
efﬁcient immunotherapy. Infusion of in vitro generated Th1
cells has been reported to promote antitumor immunity (35).
Th17 lymphocytes have recently emerged as a new effector
CD4þ T helper cell subset (41) exhibiting effector functions
distinct from Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes (42). Th17 have been
identiﬁed as major contributors to the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune conditions in animals and humans (42).
However, the role of Th17 cells in cancer remains controversial.
Although some studies have documented the antitumoral
efﬁcacy of these cells (34, 43–45), others have reported on
their immunosuppressive properties (46). These conﬂicting

results related to the protumoral versus antitumoral properties
of Th17 may be explained by the high degree of plasticity of
these cells (47–49). Supporting the antitumoral role of in vitro
polarized Th17, Muranski and colleagues demonstrated that
adoptive Th17 cell therapy has the potential to eliminate
established tumors. The antitumoral efﬁcacy of Th17 lymphocytes depended on their ability to produce both IFN-g and IL17 (43, 44). Consistent with these studies, our own results
indicated that Th17 generated from OT-II mice exhibit antitumoral effects against B16-OVA melanoma (unpublished
data). In this study, we demonstrated that the therapeutic
efﬁcacy of adoptively transferred Th1 or Th17 lymphocytes was
signiﬁcantly enhanced by doxorubicin administration, resulting in impaired development of the highly metastatic 4T1
mammary carcinoma.
Doxorubicin is widely used in chemotherapeutic regimen
primarily for its conventional direct tumoricidal activity. Here
we highlight a new application for this drug as a selective
MDSC-targeting agent, which can be used to overcome a major
mechanism of tumor immune evasion. These results advocate
for the implementation of doxorubicin in combination strategies to enhance the efﬁcacy of immunotherapy.
