Summary

Author Manuscript

The regulation and stem cell origin of normal and neoplastic gastric glands are uncertain. Here, we
show that Mist1 expression marks quiescent stem cells in the gastric corpus isthmus. Mist1+ stem
cells serve as a cell-of-origin for intestinal-type cancer with the combination of Kras and Apc
mutation, and for diffuse-type cancer with the loss of E-cadherin. Diffuse-type cancer
development is dependent on inflammation mediated by Cxcl12+ endothelial cells and Cxcr4+
gastric innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). These cells form the perivascular gastric stem cell niche, and
Wnt5a produced from ILCs activates RhoA to inhibit anoikis in the E-cadherin-depleted cells.
Targeting Cxcr4, ILCs, or Wnt5a inhibits diffuse-type gastric carcinogenesis, providing targets
within the neoplastic gastric stem cell niche.

Introduction
Gastric cancer is the third most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide. In the gastric
corpus within the proximal stomach, the glands contain chief cells that are important for
digestion, and parietal cells that are vital for acid production, controlled in part by
enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. There are also intervening mucous neck cells, above
which are the superficial pits that are lined by pit cell epithelium. Despite abundant literature
on small intestinal stem cells (ISCs), an infrequent site of human cancer, there have been

relatively few studies addressing the stem cells that maintain the normal and neoplastic
gastric epithelium.

Author Manuscript

Tissue stem cells maintain the integrity of rapidly proliferating tissues such as the
gastrointestinal epithelium, residing within a stem cell niche. Replicative quiescence and a
relatively undifferentiated morphology have generally been considered cardinal properties of
adult stem cells (Malam and Cohn, 2014; Mills and Shivdasani, 2011). In the gastric corpus,
earlier radiolabeling and electron microscopy studies suggest a single undifferentiated,
“granule-free” cell as the putative stem cell in the isthmus of each gastric unit of the mouse
(Karam and Leblond, 1993; Mills and Shivdasani, 2011). Studies suggest that within the
corpus isthmus, Sox2+ cells may be long-lived stem cells, while Tff2+ cells are relatively
short-lived progenitors (Arnold et al., 2011; Quante et al., 2010). More recently, a “reserve
stem-like cell” population expressing Troy or Mist1 was postulated to reside at the base of
corpus gland (Stange et al., 2013).

Author Manuscript

Gastric cancer is classified into an intestinal-type and a diffuse-type, and carcinogenesis in
the stomach is strongly associated with chronic inflammation. Oncogenic mutations such as
Kras and Apc targeted to gastric stem/progenitor cells led to intestinal-type metaplasia or
dysplasia in mice (Barker et al., 2010; Okumura et al., 2010). By contrast, the E-cadherin
gene (CDH1) is frequently mutated or down-regulated in diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC)
(Guilford et al., 1998). In a rodent model, knockout of Cdh1 was insufficient to initiate
gastric tumors, but did predispose to the development of DGC with signet-ring cells
following additional genetic events (Shimada et al., 2012). Studies of prophylactic
gastrectomy specimens from germline carriers of CDH1 mutations have revealed that DGC
appears to arise in the proximal gastric isthmus (Humar et al., 2007), but the cellular origin
of all gastric cancers remains unknown.

Tissue stem cells and cancer development are maintained by their niche. The Wnt signaling
pathway plays a central role in the maintenance of ISCs, which are supported by the ISC
niche, including both Paneth cells (Sato et al., 2011) and the surrounding mesenchyme
(Farin et al., 2012). However, the gastric corpus does not normally depend on the Wnt
pathway (Mills and Shivdasani, 2011), and therefore the critical pathway regulating corpus
stem cell niche is largely unknown. In the gut mesenchyme, several cell types including
pericytes, nerves, or mesothelial cells (Miyoshi et al., 2012; Worthley et al., 2015; Zhao et
al., 2014) are reported to maintain tissue stem cells and contribute to cancer development. In
the bone marrow, perivascular stromal cells including endothelial cells, Cxcl12-abundant
reticular (CAR) cells, and nerves, promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and
neoplastic changes through the production of cytokines or chemokines such as Cxcl12 or
SCF (Hanoun et al., 2014; Mendelson and Frenette, 2014; Pitt et al., 2015). However,
whether such stromal factors play a role in the normal and neoplastic gut stem cell niche
remains unclear.

Results
Mist1 is a marker of quiescent stem cells in the gastric corpus isthmus

Author Manuscript

We utilized Mist1-CreERT2 knockin mice, where Cre recombinase is induced by tamoxifen
(TAM) in cells expressing a bHLH transcription factor Mist1, and investigated the
contribution of Mist1+ “reserve stem-like” chief cells to gastric carcinogenesis. To clarify
the expression pattern of Mist1 in the normal stomach, we crossed Mist1-CreERT2 mice
with R26-mTmG mice. This reporter features the dichotomous expression of red (without
recombination) or green fluorescence (with recombination). Most of the recombined Mist1+
cells were detected in mature chief cells in the lower third of the glands (position 1–14) 1
day after TAM induction, (Figure 1A). However, Mist1+ recombined cells were also evident
as rare single cells in the isthmus. Recombination in the isthmus was observed in either R26TdTomato or R26-LacZ mice, or with low dose TAM (1 mg) (Figure S1A). Endogenous
Mist1 expression in the isthmus was confirmed by in situ hybridization (Figure S1B). Their
electron microscopy appearance was similar to the “granule free” stem cells previously
reported (Karam and Leblond, 1993) (Figure 1B).

The GFP+ Mist1 lineage expanded gradually over 540 days (Figure 1C–1D). In contrast to a
previous report (Stange et al., 2013), our detailed time course revealed bi-directional
expansion from single Mist1+ cells at position 25–30 in the isthmus, both upward towards
the lumen and deeper into the gland, independent of the dose of TAM (Figure S1C). The
approximate doubling time of Mist1+ isthmus cells is 120 hours or 5 days (Figure S1D), and
these cells first divided into isthmus progenitors with small or spindle appearance (Figure
S1E), followed later by the differentiation into surface pit and neck cells, and subsequently
into parietal cells. Over time, the number of GFP+ cells in the chief cell region declines
whilst the isthmus clone expands (Figure 1D). Lineage tracing persisted beyond 18 months
post-induction with whole labeled corpus glands, proving that Mist1+ cells self-renew
(Figure 1E). Mist1-CreERT2;R26-Confetti mice show that single-color clonal expansion is
seen predominantly in the isthmus area, while chief cells show scattered multi-color labeling
(Figure 1F–1G). These data indicate that Mist1+ isthmus cell is the major source of lineage
tracing of corpus glands.

Author Manuscript

In this period, Mist1+ cells gave rise to mucus neck cells (GS-II), parietal cells (H/KATPase), surface pit cells (TFF1), tuft cells (Dclk1), and ECL cells (chromogranin A), while
initially Mist1+ cells were negative for these markers (Figure S1F–S1G). Mist1+ chief cells
at the base of glands are as expected positive for GIF at day 2 after TAM, while the Mist1+
isthmus cells are GIF-negative (Figure S1H). However, the early traced GIF+ chief cells at
the base of glands decreased over time with an increase of traced GIF− isthmus cells (Figure
S1I–S1J). Thus, Mist1+ basal chief cells are labeled by initial TAM induction, but that these
cells turn over and disappear, finally to be renewed from the isthmus-derived Mist1+ stem
cell.
Mist1+ isthmus cells are responsible for gastric lineage tracing
We confirmed no overlap between Mist1+ cells and reported gastric stem cell markers
Cckbr+ or Sox2+ (Arnold et al., 2011; Hayakawa et al., 2015) (Figure S1K–S1L). Since

chief cells have also been shown to be Lgr5+ (Stange et al., 2013), we generated Mist1CreERT2;Lgr5-DTR-GFP;R26-Tdtomato mice (Tian et al., 2011). Similar to GIF staining,
the vast majority of Mist1+ chief cells at the base are Lgr5+, whereas the Mist1+ isthmus
cells are Lgr5− (Figure 1H). Thus, we ablated Lgr5+ cells, which included Mist1+ chief
cells, by administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) (Figure S1M). After giving TAM and DT,
100% of labeled chief cells were ablated (Figure 1I–1J, S1N). The expression of Lgr5 or Gif
was markedly reduced by DT ablation (Figure S1O). However, the number of isthmus
Mist1+ cells was even increased, and lineage tracing occurred at same frequency as the
control (non-DT) group, accompanied with faster cell division (Figure 1I, 1K, S1P–S1S).
After 6 months, the isthmus Mist1+ cells gave rise to chief cells. Similarly, ablation of chief
cells by the elastase inhibitor DMP-777 (Nomura et al., 2005) did not affect the frequency of
lineage tracing (Figure S1T–S1W). In contrast, when we treated mice with 5-Fluorouracil
(5-FU) to kill isthmus stem/progenitor cells (Figure S1X–S1Y) (Stange et al., 2013), the
mice showed almost no lineage tracing events but maintained a similar number of labeled
chief cells at the gland base for 6 months (Figure 1L–1N). Thus, Mist1+ isthmus cells, and
not Mist1+ chief cells, are responsible for lineage tracing in the corpus.
Isthmus Mist1+ cells give rise to intestinal-type metaplasia and cancer

Author Manuscript

In the isthmus, 1.1% of the Mist1+ cells were Ki67+ (Figure 2A), thus, more than 98% of
Mist1+ isthmus stem cells are quiescent. KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated protooncogenes in a variety of cancers, including gastric cancer. To investigate the effect of Kras
mutation in gastric stem cells, we crossed Mist1-CreERT2 mice to LSL-KrasG12D mutant
mice. Kras mutation in Mist1+ isthmus cells resulted in an increased percentage of
Ki67+Mist1+ cells and overall faster cell division (Figure S2A–S2C). These cells formed
Ki67+ dysplastic foci in the isthmus, which contained Alcian blue positive metaplastic cells
(Figure 2B–2D). The metaplastic/dysplastic foci moved from the isthmus to the bottom of
glands with loss of parietal cells and chief cells, and eventually replaced the entire glands
with intestinal metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia (Figure S2D). We generated Mist1CreERT2;LSL-KrasG12D;Lgr5-DTR mice, and ablated isthmus cells and chief cells by
giving 5-FU and DT, accordingly, after TAM induction (Figure S2E). Strikingly, 5-FU
inhibited the metaplasia development, while DT ablation did not (Figure 2E–2F), indicating
that the Mist1+ isthmus cells, and not the Mist1+ chief cells, are an origin of Kras-induced
IM and dysplasia.

Author Manuscript

Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by inactivating Apc is a common initiating
event in many gastrointestinal tumors (Barker et al., 2010; Barker et al., 2009). Thus, we
established Mist1-CreERT2;Apcflox/flox mice. Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was
observed in the Mist1+ lineage (isthmus and chief cells). However, nuclear β-catenin+ cells
in corpus Mist1+ cells did not form dysplasia at later time points (up to 8 months) (Figure
2G–2H), which seems contrary to the phenotype of Apc loss in stem cells in the gastric
antrum, small intestine, and colon. In fact, whereas Wnt inhibition by Dickkopf-1 (DKK1)
overexpression leads to marked decrease in proliferation in the intestine and colon,
proliferation in the corpus was not inhibited (Figure S2F–S2G), suggesting that tumor
initiation or proliferation in the corpus is likely independent of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

IM in the stomach is a known risk factor or precursor lesion for IGC. Thus, we attempted to
induce Wnt/β-catenin activation in the presence of IM. We generated Mist1-CreERT2;LSLKrasG12D;Apcflox/flox mice, and this mouse developed intramucosal IGC with the expansion
of nuclear β-catenin+ cells in 4 months (Figure 2I). Thus, Mist1+ stem cells can give rise to
IGC with loss of Apc only when Kras-induced IM is also present. Notch signaling is another
important pathway regulating gastric proliferation (Kim and Shivdasani, 2011). The Notch
inhibitor dibenzazepine (DBZ) reduced the expansion of Mist1-lineage tracing as well as
proliferation in the isthmus (Figure S2H–S2K), and constitutive activation of Notch
signaling in Mist1+ stem cells by generating Mist1-CreERT2;Eef1a1-LSL-Notch1(IC) mice
(Buonamici et al., 2009) resulted in the development of IGC (Figure S2L). Although Mist1
protein expression is decreased in Kras/Apc-induced IGC, aberrant Notch activation
increased the number of Mist1+ cells in tumor (Figure S1Q, S2M). The dysplastic cells in
Notch-induced tumor did not display nuclear β-catenin accumulation, suggesting that in the
corpus, Notch signaling is a Wnt-independent oncogenic pathway through which Mist1+
stem cells can progress to IGC.
Mist1+ isthmus cells can form corpus organoids in a Lgr5-independent fashion

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the stem cell properties of Mist1+ cells in vitro, we isolated corpus glands from
Mist1-CreERT2;R26-mTmG mice 1 day following TAM induction. Mist1+ green cells were
observed in the 2 distinct positions, and Mist1+ isthmus cells expanded to form cystic
organoids in the reported culture method (Stange et al., 2013), while Mist1+ chief cells
remained as single cells and eventually disappeared (Figure 3A). The GFP+ Mist1-derived
cells survived in vitro for at least 2 months, confirming longevity. Even after ablation of
Lgr5+ chief cells in Mist1-CreERT2;Lgr5-DTR;R26-TdTomato mice by DT injection,
isthmus Mist1+ cells continued to lineage trace and give rise to chief cells in cultured
organoids (Figure 3B–3C). We next sorted Mist1+ cells after DT or 5-FU treatment to the
mice (lacking chief cells and isthmus cells, respectively) (Figure 3D–3F). Colony formation
efficiency increased in the DT-treated group and decreased in the 5-FU-treated group,
suggesting that isthmus Mist1+ cells are the true corpus stem cells, rather than Mist1+ chief
cells. We compared gene expression patterns between the total Mist1+ population (majority
of which were chief cells), DT-ablated isthmus Mist1+ population, and the differentiated
parietal cell population (Figure S3A). Lgr5 and Gif expression are markedly downregulated
in isthmus Mist1+ cells compared to total Mist1+ cells. Mist1 expression is upregulated in
both total and isthmus Mist1+ population. The expression of several stem/progenitor
markers, such as Cd44 and Sox9, or target genes of Wnt and Notch signaling, such as
Ccnd1, Notch1, and Hes1, remain at higher levels in the isthmus population, suggesting that
isthmus Mist1+ cells are Lgr5− but still exhibit stem cell characteristics.

The Wnt3a/R-spondin1 (W3a/Rspo1)-dependent culture system fails to produce corpusspecific cell lineage such as parietal cells and ECL cells (Stange et al., 2013). Instead,
W3aENR media (W3a, EGF, Noggin, and Rspo1) induces marked upregulation of Lgr5 (3times higher than gastric antrum organoids) (Figure 3G). Compared to standard W3aENR
media, culture of corpus glands in ENJ media (where Wnt3a/Rspo1 were replaced by Notch
ligand Jagged-1) led to decreased expression of Lgr5 or Gif, suggesting that Wnt3a/Rspo1
lead to expansion of chief cells. In contrast, in ENJ media, we observed greater amounts of

parietal cells and ECL cells than in W3aENR media both in RT-PCR and immunostaining
assays (Figure 3G and S3B), suggesting that the activation of Notch signaling is more
important for preserving mature corpus cell types in culture than canonical Wnt signaling.
Addition of a γ-secretase inhibitor blocked corpus organoid growth (Figure S3C–S3D), thus
Notch signaling is important for corpus stem cell maintenance and growth. When we
cultured Mist1-CreERT2;Lgr5-DTR;R26-TdTomato glands, antral and corpus organoids
cultured with W3aENR did not grow and died following DT treatment (Figure 3H–3I),
indicating that organoid growth is highly dependent on Lgr5+ cells in W3aENR media.
However, lineage-traced corpus organoids survived with ENJ plus DT media (Figure S3E),
proving that a non-Lgr5 stem cell population maintains organoid growth in Wnt3a/Rspo1independent culture conditions.

Cxcl12+ endothelium and Cxcr4+ ILCs contribute to the corpus stem cell niche through
Wnt5a production
Given our in vitro data suggesting that Wnt3a or canonical Wnt signaling is not a critical
niche factor in the corpus, we explored which Wnt ligands are indeed expressed in the
stomach and intestine (Figure 4A and S4A). Among known Wnt ligands, Wnt3a expression
was quite low in the corpus, in contrast to the intestine. Instead, an atypical Wnt ligand,
Wnt5a, was highly expressed in the corpus. In situ hybridization of Wnt5a revealed focal
expression in the isthmus stroma (Figure 4B) coincident with the known expression of
Cxcr4 (Shibata et al., 2013). In Cxcr4-EGFP mice, Cxcr4+ cells were found in the isthmus
area as rare single cells, showing almost identical distribution to Wnt5a expression (Figure
4C). Cxcr4+ cells and Mist1+ cells represent distinct populations, although they were located
in close proximity within the isthmus (Figure 4D).

Author Manuscript

Immunostaining revealed that Cxcr4+ cells in the corpus are negative for E-cadherin or
stromal markers, αSMA, NG2, and S100B, but positive for CD45, suggesting that they are
tissue-resident hematopoietic cells recruited to the isthmus (Figure 4E and S4B). About 60%
of gastric CD45+Cxcr4+ cells from the whole gastric corpus are CD11b+ myeloid lineages
(Figure S4C). CD3+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and NK1.1+ classical NK cells are Cxcr4−. The
remaining 40% of CD45+Cxcr4+ cells are Lineage-negative
(CD3−Gr1−CD11b−CD45R−Ter119−), and about half of the Lin−Cxcr4+ population is a
CD90.2+CD127+ lymphoid population (Figure 4F, S4C). The other half is predominantly ckit+FcεRIɑ+ mast cells. Immunostaining defined the isthmus Cxcr4+ cells as Lin−CD90.2+
intraepithelial gastric innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) (Figure 4E, S4D). Id2-GFP mice, which
mark all types of ILCs (Hoyler et al., 2012), show similar distribution pattern as Cxcr4+
cells (Figure S4E). The majority (90%) of gastric Cxcr4+ ILCs are NKp46−CD4−,
ScaI+ICOS+KLRG+ ILC2 cells, and a small population (5%) are Rorgt+NKp46− ILC3 cells
(Figure 4F, S4F). In fact, gastric Cxcr4+ ILC population is enriched with ILC2-specific
genes (Figure S4G).
In the sorted Mist1+ cells and Cxcr4+ cells, Wnt5a was expressed primarily in the Cxcr4+
cells (Figure S4H–S4I), confirming our in situ hybridization findings. When we treated
Cxcr4+ cells with Cxcl12 in vitro, Wnt5a expression was upregulated (Figure S4J). We
hypothesized that the Cxcr4+ cell might be a niche cell, supporting gastric stem cell

function. To test this possibility, we performed a co-culture experiment with “red” Mist1+
cells and “green” Cxcr4+ cells. Co-culture of Mist1+ cells with Cxcr4+ cells significantly
enhanced “red” colony formation ability (Figure 4G–4H). Treatment with Cxcl12
demonstrated an additive effect on Cxcr4+ cell co-culture, while it had no effect on Mist1+
cell culture alone, indicating that Cxcl12 acts through the Cxcr4+ ILCs. Furthermore, the
Cxcr4+ ILC population exhibits the highest expression of Wnt5a compared to CD45+Cxcr4−
cells or Cxcr4+ non-ILCs (Figure 4I). The colony formation ability of Mist1+ stem cells is
enhanced by Wnt5a or co-culture with Cxcr4+ ILC population. However, Wnt5a-deficient
ILCs which are sorted from Cag-CreERT2;Wnt5aflox/flox mouse stomach after TAM
induction failed to show the same effect (Figure 4J). Thus, Cxcr4+ILC-derived Wnt5a plays
a key role for promoting Mist1+ stem cell colony formation.

We explored the source of Cxcl12 in the stomach. In Cxcl12-dsRED mice (Ding and
Morrison, 2013), there were frequent dsRED+ cells in the stroma near the isthmus (Figure
4K). Indeed, Cxcr4+ ILCs and Cxcl12+ stromal cells in Cxcr4-EGFP;Cxcl12-dsRED mice
were frequently positioned in close proximity (Figure 4L–4M). We confirmed that Cxcl12+
cells are CD31+ and endomucin+ endothelial cells (Figure 4N and S4K). We compared RNA
expression between dsRED+CD31+ cells (35% of total CD31+ cells) and dsRED−CD31+
cells by qRT-PCR array (Figure S4L and Table S1). Among pathways potentially involved
in the regulation of Cxcl12 expression, we found that Cxcl12+ cells express BMP receptor 2,
and BMP2 treatment in vitro upregulates Cxcl12 expression (Figure S4M–S4N), consistent
with previous findings (Yang et al., 2008). Interestingly, Tie2-Cre;Cxcl12flox/flox;Cxcr4EGFP mice, with targeted knockout of Cxcl12 in endothelial cells, displayed a significant
reduction in the number of Cxcr4+ cells in the isthmus compared to control mice (Figure
4O–4P). Together, endothelial Cxcl12 is important for the recruitment of Wnt5a-producing
Cxcr4+ ILCs in the stomach.
E-cadherin loss in Mist1+ cells develops diffuse-type cancer dependent on chronic
inflammation

Author Manuscript

We sought to establish whether Mist1+ stem cells were also a cell of origin for the diffuse
gastric cancer (DGC) by knocking out Cdh1 gene in Mist1+ cells. Mist1CreERT2;Cdh1flox/flox mice (Cdh1ΔMist1) developed the pathognomonic, small mucousproducing atypical cell foci in the isthmus of Cdh1ΔMist1 mice 10 days after TAM, but not in
the chief cell region (Figure 5A–5B). E-cadherin was downregulated in these atypical
appearing isthmus cells, consistent with early signet-ring cell morphology, recapitulating the
earliest events in the pathogenesis of human signet-ring cell carcinoma. Ablation of chief
cells and isthmus cells by DT and 5-FU treatment with Mist1-CreERT2;Cdh1flox/flox; Lgr5DTR mice confirmed that the isthmus Mist1+ cells are an origin of signet-ring cells (Figure
S5A–S5B). Cxcl12/Cxcr4 niche cells were not affected by 5-FU treatment (not shown).
Nevertheless, the number of atypical cells gradually declined and disappeared (Figure 5C),
suggesting that E-cadherin loss leads to epithelial cell death and is on its own insufficient to
initiate DGC. Given that mild inflammation without gastric atrophy is a common feature of
DGC (Carneiro et al., 2004), we infected TAM-induced Cdh1ΔMist1 mice with Helicobacter
felis (Hf) to induce chronic inflammation. Surprisingly, in mice with Hf infection, atypical

foci were preserved and expanded even after 1 year TAM induction (Figure 5C). Lineagetraced DGC with numerous signet ring cells was detected at 18 months post Hf infection in
Cdh1ΔMist1 mice (Figure 5D, 7 of 9 mice (78%)), along with the increase of Mist1+ cells in
DGC (Figure S1Q, S5C). Addition of Trp53 mutation in this setting lead to invasive DGC
within 9 months (Figure S5D). Interestingly, administration of dexamethasone to Hfinfected Cdh1ΔMist1 mice reduced the number of signet-ring cell foci to the same level as
non-infected control mice (Figure 5E–5G). In contrast, another inflammation-associated
cancer model, H/K-ATPase-IL-1β transgenic mice (Tu et al., 2008), also showed a dramatic
expansion of lineage-traced signet-ring cells when crossed to Cdh1ΔMist1 mice, even without
Hf infection (Figure 5H–5J). Thus, DGC development derived from Mist1+ stem cells is
dependent on chronic inflammation, and that anti-inflammatory therapy may be useful for
preventing DGC.

Although Troy+ chief cells are reported to act as reserve stem cells (Stange et al., 2013), we
observed a rare Troy+ population in the isthmus that could lineage trace and give rise to
cancers by examining Troy-BAC-CreERT2 mice (Fafilek et al., 2013) (Figure S6A–S6G).
Also, while Troy+ chief cells are not proliferating and do not lineage trace in mice which
preserving intact Troy expression, loss of Troy expression significantly promoted chief cell
proliferation and lineage tracing after injury (Figure S6H–S6L), similar in most respects to
the previous report, reconciling our findings with those of earlier groups (Stange et al.,
2013).
Cxcl12/Cxcr4 perivascular niche regulates DGC progression through Wnt5a production

Author Manuscript

During DGC development under chronic inflammation, corpus stem cell niche factors Cxcl12+ endothelium and Cxcr4+ ILCs - are markedly expanded or upregulated in the
region surrounding the isthmus DGC lesion (Figure 6A–6E, suggesting that these niche
factors contribute to DGC development. We tested therapeutic intervention with AMD3100,
a specific inhibitor of CXCR4, and an anti-CD90.2 antibody (Ab) for specific depletion of
ILCs. Compared with vehicle-injected control mice, AMD3100 and the anti-CD90.2 Ab
significantly reduced the number of signet-ring cell foci (Figure 6F–6H). In contrast,
overexpression of Cxcl12 in Mist1-CreERT2;H/K-ATPase-Cxcl12;Cdh1flox/flox mice led to
persistence and growth of DGC lesions over 3 months even without Hf infection (Figure 6I–
6K). Hf infection further accelerated DGC progression in this mouse model, while antiCD90.2 Ab treatment significantly reduced the number of DGC foci in the setting of Cxcl12
overexpression (Figure S6M–S6N). Thus, upregulation of Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signaling through
activation of ILCs plays a central role in DGC development.

Author Manuscript

After Hf infection, Wnt5a is highly upregulated in the stroma surrounding signet-ring lesions
in the isthmus (Figure 6L). In addition, AMD3100 and anti-CD90.2 Ab treatment, or
knockout of Cxcl12 in Tie2-lineage, significantly decreased the number of Cxcr4+ cells in
the isthmus and the expression of Wnt5a, while Cxcl12-overexpression led to an increase in
Cxcr4+ cell number and upregulation of Wnt5a (Figure 6M and S6O). Thus we tested the
contribution of Wnt5a in DGC development by transplanting Cag-CreERT; Wnt5aflox/flox
mouse bone marrow cells into Cdh1ΔMist1 mice (Figure 6N). In these chimeric mice, Ecadherin is depleted in the Mist1+ lineage and Wnt5a is knocked out in bone-marrow

derived ILCs after TAM induction. Cdh1ΔMist1 mice with Cag-CreERT;Wnt5aflox/flox bone
marrow exhibited significantly fewer signet-ring cell foci compared to Cdh1ΔMist1 mice with
WT bone marrow cells (Figure 6O–6P), indicating that Wnt5a in the hematopoietic cells
promotes DGC progression. Although there was a significant increase in the number of
Cxcr4+ cells in Kras-induced IGC model, AMD3100 failed to block either Kras or Notchdependent IGC progression (Figure S6P–S6Q), suggesting the more predominant role of this
pathway in DGC development.
RhoA activation by Wnt5a plays a role in DGC development

Author Manuscript

Wnt5a is known to activate a small GTPase protein, RhoA, which has a prosurvival effect
by inhibiting anoikis in gastric and other cancer cells (Cai et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013).
Thus, we hypothesized that ILC-derived Wnt5a activates RhoA in E-cadherin-depleted cells
and prolongs cell survival. We confirmed that Wnt5a activates RhoA in a CDH1 mutant
AGS cells by immunoprecipitation (Figure 7A). In a soft-agar assay, treatment of AGS cells
with Wnt5a enhanced sphere formation, indicating that Wnt5a promotes anchorageindependent cell growth. Interestingly, blocking RhoA activation using a Rho inhibitor,
Rhosin, diminished Wnt5a-mediated effects (Figure 7B–7C). Similar results were observed
with another DGC cell line, KATO-III. Furthermore, we found that E-cadherin-deficient
Mist1+ stem cells, which are normally unable to survive in vitro upon Cdh1 deletion,
displayed prolonged survival in the presence of Wnt5a (Figure 7D–7E). This prosurvival
effect was blocked by Rhosin, suggesting that Wnt5a-mediated RhoA activation is a key
event for the survival of Cdh1-deleted organoids. However, Wnt5a did not affect the
expansion of Kras or Notch-induced IGC organoids (not shown).

Author Manuscript

We compared these murine DGC findings with human DGC samples. Histologically, the
DGC lesions in the Cdh1ΔMist1 mice appeared quite similar to early DGC with E-cadherin
loss in patient samples (Figure 7F). Importantly, Cxcl12+ cells were found in stromal cells
that appeared similar histologically to blood vessels, with KLRG1+ lymphocytes
surrounding the signet-ring cancer cells, consistent with a role for these cells in supporting
the DGC stem cell niche.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this study, we report 4 major discoveries regarding gastric stem cell and cancer biology:
(1) quiescent Mist1+ gastric stem cells located at the isthmus of the corpus gland are an
origin of all epithelial lineages, (2) they can serve as a cellular origin of all histological types
of gastric cancer, (3) the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 axis comprising endothelial cells and ILCs regulates
the normal and neoplastic gastric stem cell niche, and (4) Wnt5a from Cxcr4+ ILCs
promotes diffuse-type cancer growth by activating RhoA. Our data provide a focus for
gastric regeneration and cancer prevention and therapy.
In the gastric corpus, the isthmus is the major site of epithelial proliferation, and for many
years has been thought to contain the “granule free” stem cell population (Karam and
Leblond, 1993). We found that the isthmus Mist1+ cells are these granule-free bona fide
stem cells in the corpus, which are remarkably quiescent, dividing infrequently (every 5
days), consistent with the original expectations for mammalian adult stem cells (Malam and
Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 December 14.

Cohn, 2014). It has been hypothesized that corpus glands may possess 2 different stem cell
zones, isthmus and chief cells (Nam et al., 2010; Stange et al., 2013). Our ablation
experiments using 5-FU and Lgr5-DT system find that only isthmus cells, not chief cells,
play a predominant role in maintaining the gastric gland and are an origin of gastric cancer.
The gradient of BMP or Shh expression determines the localized expression of Lgr5 at the
gastrointestinal gland base (Shyer et al., 2015), and basal chief cells in the corpus express
Lgr5. Thus, our model suggests that Lgr5 expression may not always reflect actual
stemness, especially in a Wnt-independent organ.

Author Manuscript

Lineage-tracing studies have been based largely on TAM-induced Cre activation, but TAM
treatment may cause epithelial cell death and influence stem cell activity (Huh et al., 2012;
Zhu et al., 2013). Given that Troy is known to have an inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling,
the knockin Troy lineage tracing may be related to a reduction in Troy expression in the
knockin mice, secondary to haploinsufficiency, resulting in enhanced Wnt signaling activity
in those mice. Whilst knockin lines have many potential advantages, disruption of even one
copy of the endogenous gene can apparently alter certain phenotypes.

Author Manuscript

The Cxcl12/Cxcr4 perivascular niche in the bone marrow has previously been identified and
studied as a major regulator of HSC (Ding and Morrison, 2013; Sugiyama et al., 2006).
However, until now the role of the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 stem cell niche axis beyond the bone
marrow has been unclear. In addition, Cxcl12 and Cxcr4 modulate the tumor
microenvironment, and targeting this axis was an effective strategy in certain cancers (Pitt et
al., 2015; Quante et al., 2011; Roccaro et al., 2014). Given that human DGCs are in general
extremely resistant to current treatment regimens, anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids
or NSAIDs, as well as specific Cxcr4 antagonists, may be useful for chemoprevention of
DGC, particularly for hereditary-type DGC prior to gastrectomy, and/or for prevention of
recurrent disease.
E-cadherin is essential for epithelial cell survival under normal conditions (Schneider et al.,
2010) and loss of E-cadherin causes cell anoikis (Kantak and Kramer, 1998). Previous
studies suggest that Cxcr4 and Wnt5a are upregulated in human gastric cancer tissues (Iwasa
et al., 2009; Kanzawa et al., 2013). Recent genome-wide analyses revealed in human DGCs
the presence of gain-of-function RHOA mutations that can inhibit anoikis (Cancer Genome
Atlas Research, 2014; Kakiuchi et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Thus, the activation of
RhoA signaling, either by gene mutation or Wnt5a-mediated effect, may be essential for the
development of DGC.

Wnt5a is a representative ligand that activates noncanonical Wnt signaling by binding to
Ror2 to regulate cell migration, polarity, proliferation, or invasion. Wnt5a is expressed in
gut stroma, and contributes to intestinal elongation and colonic regeneration, however, the
precise source of stromal Wnt5a has been unclear (Cervantes et al., 2009; Gregorieff et al.,
2005; Miyoshi et al., 2012). We propose ILCs as a major source of Wnt5a, at least in the
stomach. The function of ILCs has been highlighted in the setting of inflammatory or
infectious states, although the possibility has been raised of a role for ILCs in stem cell niche
or cancer development (Bando et al., 2015; Hanash et al., 2012; Kirchberger et al., 2013).
Our findings would support this model, and given that ILCs are a heterogeneous population

of immune cells, further efforts at detailed profiling of the ILC population in stem cell niche
and cancer are needed.

Significance
We identified a quiescent stem cell in the corpus isthmus, which can give rise to gastric
cancer. We also discovered a Cxcl12/Cxcr4 perivascular niche in the stomach, which
supports normal and neoplastic stem cells through Wnt5a production.
