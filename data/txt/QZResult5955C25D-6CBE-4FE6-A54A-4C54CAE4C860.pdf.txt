BACKGROUND: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)-positive cells exhibit stem-like or progenitor ability and have been considered
a clinically important diagnostic and therapeutic target in patients with breast cancer. In this study, the authors evaluated responsiveness to chemotherapy of ALDH1-positive cells in primary and metastatic lesions and its relation to prognosis for patients with lymph
node-positive breast cancer. METHODS: In total, 115 patients who had breast cancer with cytologically confirmed lymph node metastases and who underwent surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were evaluated. By using ALDH1 immunohistochemistry in
core-needle biopsy specimens of the primary tumor, cytology samples of axillary lymph nodes before NAC, and pathologic samples
of each after NAC, the clinical significance of ALDH1-positive cell status was evaluated in primary and metastatic lesions before and
after NAC. RESULTS: The presence of ALDH1-positive cancer cells, but not ALDH1-negative cancer cells, in primary and metastatic
lesions after NAC was associated with a worse prognosis. In multivariate analysis, only ALDH1-positive cells in metastatic lesions
after NAC correlated with overall survival. The responsiveness of ALDH1-positive cells to chemotherapy differed between primary and
metastatic lesions, and the findings indicated that ALDH1-positive cells in metastatic lesions after NAC may clinically precede those in
the primary lesion. CONCLUSIONS: The responsiveness of ALDH1-positive cells to chemotherapy in primary and metastatic lesions
and its prognostic significance were clarified in patients with breast cancer. The authors concluded that ALDH1-positive status may

INTRODUCTION
The cancer stem cell theory that was established for hematopoietic neoplasms1 has significantly changed the concept of
cancer therapy.2-10 In solid tumors, small populations of cancer cells that demonstrate tumorigenic (tumor-initiating)
ability were identified first in cluster of differentiation 44 (Indian blood group) (CD44)-positive/heat stable antigen
(CD24)-negative breast cancer cells.11 This subpopulation of cells, which demonstrated the probability of stem-like
characteristics in cancer tissue, was called cancer stem cells, and cell populations with comparable ability were detected
subsequently in various other tumors.3,6,10,12-15 Today, these subpopulations with tumorigenic ability are considered
some of the most important diagnostic and therapeutic targets in treating cancer.15-18 Li et al provided clinical evidence of
the chemoresistance of CD44-positive/CD24-negative cells in patients with breast cancer.19
Recently, Ginestier et al demonstrated that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)-positive cells display stem-like or
progenitor abilities in both normal breast epithelium cells and breast cancer cells.20 At the same time, they demonstrated
the clinical significance of these cells, because patients who had breast cancer with ALDH1-positive cells had a worse prognosis than patients who had breast cancer without such cells.20 Tanei et al reported that tumors that had ALDH1-positive
cells from patients with breast cancer displayed higher rates of resistance to chemotherapy.21 Furthermore, because
ALDH1-positive cells exhibit tumorigenic ability and have prognostic significance, ALDH1-positive status may be
involved not only in proliferation of the primary tumor but also in the formation of metastases.20
Given these basic and clinical implications, it has been speculated that ALDH1-positive cells in primary tumors and
metastases represent some of the most clinically important diagnostic and therapeutic targets in patients with breast

cancer.20,22,23 However, the responsiveness of ALDH1positive cells to chemotherapy in primary and metastatic
lesions and how that responsiveness is correlated with the
prognosis of patients with breast cancer remain unclear.
In the current study, we used core-needle biopsies (CNBs)
from primary tumors and cytologic samples of axillary
lymph nodes before patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and we also used pathologic samples of
both primary tumors and axillary lymph nodes after
patients received NAC to evaluate the responsiveness to
chemotherapy of ALDH1-positive cells in primary and
metastatic lesions and the correlation of that responsiveness to prognosis in patients with lymph node-positive
breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

We examined paraffin blocks with tumor samples from
115 patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer who
had cytologically confirmed axillary lymph node metastases and who had undergone surgery after NAC at Chiba
University Hospital between November 2002 and February 2008. We selected patients with histologically proven,
clearly invasive breast carcinoma who had undergone axillary lymph node dissection and for whom all resected
materials were available for histologic examination.
Because the response of lymph node metastases after
NAC was not evaluated after level II or III lymph node
dissection in patients who had supraclavicular or parasternal metastases, these patients were excluded.
Primary tumors were pathologically confirmed
based on CNB, and positive axillary lymph node metastases were confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. No
patients had received preoperative radiation or hormone
therapy. Follow-up was available for all 115 patients; 29
patients developed distant metastasis, and 22 patients
died of breast cancer. Survival data were collected up to
May 1, 2011 (median follow-up, 71 months; range, 39102 months). Patient outcomes were defined as overall
survival (OS). The duration of OS was determined as the
time between the start of NAC and the date of death.
We histologically examined all CNB specimens and
resected primary tumors and axillary lymph node metastases. All carcinomas were classified according to the criteria
of the World Health Organization. The combined histologic grade (1, 2, or 3) of infiltrating ductal carcinoma was
obtained according to a modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson histologic grading system with guidelines as suggested
by Nottingham City Hospital pathologists. Nuclear grading was based on nuclear polymorphism. Staging at the
3900

time of diagnosis was based on the tumor-lymph nodemetastasis (TNM) classification. Tumor size and lymph
node status were evaluated separately. The study protocol
was approved by the ethics committee of our institute,
and written informed consent was obtained from all
patients before participation.
Local and Systemic Therapy

All axillary lymph node metastases, including infraclavicular lymph node metastases, were diagnosed by ultrasound-guided cytology at the initial visit. All patients
received neoadjuvant doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) plus cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) at 3-week intervals for 4
cycles; then, they received paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) at weekly
intervals for 12 cycles. Within 4 weeks after NAC, all
patients underwent breast surgery. Patients with infraclavicular metastases underwent level III lymph node dissection, and patients without infraclavicular metastases
underwent level II lymph node dissection. All patients
with residual axillary metastases received radiotherapy to
the chest wall and supraclavicular lymph nodes. For all
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients, tamoxifen
(tamoxifen citrate) or an aromatase inhibitor was prescribed as adjuvant treatment regardless of age or any
other prognostic factor.
Pathologic Examination and Assessment of
Dissected Primary Tumors and Lymph Nodes

Pathologic response of primary tumors and lymph nodes
to NAC was assessed for all patients. All lymph nodes
were sliced into multiple serial sections of approximately
2 mm thickness. These sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and evaluated by pathologists.
In each primary tumor and axillary lymph node, residual
cancer cells were evaluated. A pathologic complete
response (pCR) was defined as the absence of residual
cancer cells in both the primary lesion and axillary lymph
nodes.
Immunohistochemical Staining of ALDH1

For ALDH1 immunostaining, the paraffin-embedded
sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in
graded alcohol. Antigen enhancement was achieved by
incubating the sections in citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (DAKO
Japan, Kyoto, Japan), as recommended. ALDH1 antibody (monoclonal, immunoglobulin [Ig]G isotype; BD
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) was used at 1:200 dilution.
Staining was performed using the Envision Kit (DAKO
Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Paraffin
sections of normal liver tissue were used as a positive control for ALDH1 antibody staining (Fig. 1a). Immunohistochemical staining was evaluated independently by 3

the clinical outcomes. At the same time as the ALDH1
immunostaining, other serial sections were examined for
cytokeratin (AE1/AE3; Dako Cytomation, Kyoto, Japan)
using immunohistochemistry, and we excluded staining
of stroma and lymphocytes in primary tumors and lymph
nodes. The cytoplasmic staining of cancer cells was considered ALDH1-positive. By using the criteria described
by Ginestier et al,20 immunohistochemical staining of
ALDH1 was classified as 3þ (50% positive tumor cells),
2þ (<50% and 10% positive tumor cells), 1þ (<10%
and 5% positive tumor cells), or negative (<5% positive
tumor cells). For subsequent analyses, tumors that had
1þ, 2þ, or 3þ expression of ALDH1 were considered
ALDH1-positive. ALDH1 immunostaining was

Histologic Grade and Estrogen Receptor,
Progesterone Receptor, Human Epidermal
Growth Factor Receptor 2, and Ki-67 Status

Routine histologic examination was performed with
H&E staining. Histologic grade was determined using the
Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading system. ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status was defined as positive when
1% of tumor cells showed had immunohistochemical
staining (ER, clone 1D5; PR, clone PgR636; DAKO
Japan). Staining for human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)
was scored into 4 grades (0, 1, 2, or 3), and tumors with
scores of 3þ were considered HER2-positive. Tumors
with scores of 2þ were determined by fluorescence in situ
hybridization using PathVision HER2 DNA Probe kits

(SRL Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz). Tumors that contained >2
genes per cell also were considered HER2-positive. Ki-67
was defined as positive when 15% of tumor cells had
positive immunohistochemical staining (clone MIB-1,
IgG isotype; DAKO Japan).
Cell Transfer Technique

Coverslips from Papanicolaou-stained smears were removed
by soaking in xylene, and the smear was then covered with
Mount-Quick liquid medium (Newcomer Supply, Middleton, Wis). After microwaving for 5 minutes to polymerize
the liquid plastic, the slides were soaked in warm water, and
the plastic film containing smear-medium complex was
peeled and lifted from the original glass slide. After marking
by the cytopathologist, the plastic film was cut with scissors
and transferred onto several positively charged glass slides
with the original orientation of cells to the slide still intact.
Those glass slides, with the divided smear sections, were
placed in the microwave for 5 minutes to secure adhesion.
The Mount-Quick medium was then removed in 3 changes
of xylene for up to 30 minutes and rehydrated through a
series of ethanol to distilled water. Slides were then placed in
phosphate-buffered saline.
Immunocytochemical Staining of ALDH1

Smear sections were incubated at room temperature for
1 hour with ALDH1 antibody at 1:300 dilution. Staining
was achieved using the Envision Kit according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy
of liver tissue was used as a positive control for ALDH1
antibody staining (Fig. 1f). ALDH1 immunostaining was
performed for these smear sections (Fig. 1g,h).
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using software. The OS
duration was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method
and was compared using log-rank tests. Associations
between the prevalence of ALDH1-positive cells and
clinical parameters were assessed using the chi-square test.
A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for
univariate and multivariate analyses. P values < .05 were
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
ALDH1-Positive Cancer Cells, Not
ALDH1-Negative Cancer Cells, in Primary
Tumor After Chemotherapy Were a Prognostic
Factor in Patients With Lymph Node-Positive
Breast Cancer

In total, 115 patients with breast cancer who were diagnosed
preoperatively as lymph node positive by cytology underwent surgery after NAC. Of these, 16 patients (13.9%) had
3902

no residual primary tumor, and 99 patients (86.1%) had
residual primary tumor after NAC. No significant difference
in OS was observed between patients with and without residual tumor after NAC (P ¼ .056) (Fig. 2a). To evaluate
ALDH1-positive cells in primary tumor before NAC,
ALDH1 immunohistochemistry was performed in CNB
specimens from all patients. Of the 115 patients, the
ALDH1 staining grade in primary tumors before NAC was
negative in 70 patients (60.9%), 1þ in 32 patients (27.8%),
2þ in 9 patients (7.8%), and 3þ in 4 patients (3.5%).
Forty-five patients who had grade 1þ or greater ALDH1
staining were considered ALDH1-positive. Of all 115
patients, 45 patients (39.1%) had ALDH1-positive cells
in their primary tumor, and 70 patients (60.9%) did not.
Furthermore, to evaluate the prognostic significance of
ALDH1-positive cells in primary tumor after NAC,
ALDH1 immunohistochemistry was performed on surgical
specimens from all patients. Of 70 patients who had
ALDH1-positive cells () in CNB specimens before NAC,
only 1 patient had ALDH1-positive cells in residual primary
tumor after NAC. The other patients had ALDH1-positive
cells () or had no residual tumor. After NAC, 35 patients
(30.4%) had ALDH1-positive cells in residual primary
tumor, and 80 patients (69.6%) did not. OS was significantly shorter in patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ)
in residual primary tumor after NAC than in those with
ALDH1-positive cells () (P < .0001) (Fig. 2b). Finally, of
all 115 patients, 15 patients (13.1%) had no residual tumor,
65 patients (56.5%) had residual tumor with ALDH1positive cells (), and 35 patients (30.4%) had residual
tumor with ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (Table 1). OS was
significantly shorter in patients who had residual tumor with
ALDH1-positive cells (þ) than in patients who had no residual tumor (P ¼ .0036) (Fig. 2c). It is noteworthy that
the OS of patients who had residual tumor with ALDH1positive cells () was significantly longer than that in
patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (P < .0001),
and their OS did not differ significantly compared with
the OS of patients who had no residual tumor (P ¼ .314)
(Fig. 2c). These data indicate that, in residual primary tumor
after NAC, ALDH1-positive cancer cells, but not ALDH1negative cancer cells, represent a prognostic factor in patients
with lymph node-positive breast cancer.

Figure 2. The clinical significance of residual pathologic tumor and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)-positive cells was examined in primary lesions from patients with breast cancer after they received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). (a) In pathologic
analyses of primary lesions after NAC, overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between patients who had residual primary
tumor (orange line) and patients who had no residual primary tumor (blue line) (P ¼ .056). (b) In an ALDH1 immunohistochemical
analysis of primary lesions after NAC, the OS of patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (red line) was significantly shorter
than the OS of patients who had ALDH1-positive cells () (light blue line) (P < .0001). (c) In evaluations that considered both
pathologic residual tumor and ALDH1-positive cells in primary lesions after NAC, the OS of patients who had residual primary tumor with ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (red line) was significantly shorter than the OS of patients who had no residual primary tumor
(blue line) (P ¼ .0036). The OS of patients who had residual primary tumor with ALDH1-positive cells () (purple line) was significantly longer than the OS of patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (red line) (P < .0001), but there was no significant difference compared with the OS of patients who had no residual primary tumor (blue line) (P ¼ .314).

patients, we evaluated residual metastases after NAC.
There were 43 patients (37.4%) who had no residual
metastases after NAC and 72 patients (62.6%) who exhibited residual metastases. OS was significantly shorter in
patients with residual metastases after NAC than in those
with no residual metastases (P ¼ .0019) (Fig. 3a). To evaluate the prognostic significance of ALDH1-positive cells
in axillary lymph node metastases after NAC, ALDH1
immunohistochemistry was performed in surgical specimens of all axillary lymph nodes. Nineteen patients
(16.5%) had ALDH1-positive cells in residual axillary
metastases, and 96 patients (83.5%) did not. The OS of
patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in residual
axillary metastases after NAC was significantly shorter

than the OS of patients who had ALDH1-positive cells

patients (37.4%) had no residual axillary metastases, 53
patients (46.1%) had residual axillary metastases with
ALDH1-positive cells (), and 19 patients (16.5%) had
residual axillary metastases with ALDH1-positive cells
(þ) (Table 1). The OS of patients who had residual axillary metastases with ALDH1-positive cells (þ) was significantly shorter than the OS of patients who had no residual
axillary metastases (P < .0001) (Fig. 3c). It is noteworthy
that the OS of patients who had residual axillary metastases with ALDH1-positive cells () was significantly longer than the OS of patients who had ALDH1-positive
cells (þ) (P < .0001), and their OS did not differ

significantly compared with the OS of patients who had
no residual axillary metastases (P ¼ .188) (Fig. 3c). These
data indicate that, in residual axillary metastases after
NAC, ALDH1-positive cancer cells, and not ALDH1negative cancer cells, are a prognostic factor for patients
with lymph node-positive breast cancer.
ALDH1-Positive Cells in Axillary Metastases
After Chemotherapy Were an Independent
Prognostic Factor in Multivariate Analysis

Next, we evaluated the difference in prognostic significance between ALDH1-positive cancer cells in residual
primary tumor after NAC and that in residual axillary metastases. Of all 115 patients, 35 patients (30.4%) had
ALDH1-positive cells in residual primary tumor after
NAC, and 80 patients (69.6%) did not. The clinicopathologic status of these 2 groups is provided in Table 2.
Patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in residual
primary tumor after NAC had characteristics of younger
age (P ¼ .0412), pCR (P ¼ .0319), and ALDH1-positive
cells (þ) in residual axillary metastases (P < .0001) compared with patients who had ALDH1-positive cells ()
(Table 2). Of all 115 patients, 19 patients (26.4%) had
ALDH1-positive cells in residual axillary metastases after
NAC, and 96 patients (73.6%) did not. The clinicopathologic status of these 2 groups is provided in Table 3.
Patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in residual
axillary metastases after NAC had characteristics of
younger age (P ¼ .0319), lymphovascular space invasion
(LVSI) (P ¼ .0032), ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in the primary tumor before NAC (P < .0001), and ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in residual primary tumor (P < .0001)
3904

compared with patients who had ALDH1-positive cells
() (Table 3). To evaluate ALDH1-positive cells in residual primary tumor and residual axillary metastases as a
potential independent prognostic factor after NAC in
patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for correlations between OS and various clinical characteristics,
including age, tumor (T) classification, lymph node metastasis before NAC (level III vs level I-II), the number of
lymph node metastasis after NAC, LVSI, histologic grade,
ER status, PR status, HER status, Ki-67 status, pCR,
ALDH1-positive cells in primary tumor before NAC,
ALDH1-positive cells in residual primary tumor, and
ALDH1-positive cells in residual axillary metastases. In
univariate analyses, LVSI (P ¼ .006), pCR (P ¼ .0006),
ALDH1-positive cells in primary tumor before NAC (P
< .0001), ALDH1-positive cells in residual primary tumor (P < .0001) and ALDH1-positive cells in residual axillary metastases (P < .0001) were correlated significantly
with OS (Table 4). Furthermore, multivariate analyses
indicated only ALDH1-positive cells in residual axillary
metastases (P ¼ .006) correlated with OS (Table 4). These
data indicate that ALDH1-positive cells in residual axillary metastases represent an independent prognostic factor
after NAC in patients with lymph node-positive breast
cancer.
Even if ALDH1-Positive Cells Remain in the
Primary Lesion, Patients With Disappearance of
Metastatic ALDH1-Positive Cells After
Chemotherapy Have a Good Prognosis

It is noteworthy that, in multivariate analyses, ALDH1positive cells in residual axillary metastases after NAC
were correlated significantly with OS, whereas ALDH1positive cells in residual primary tumor did not (Table 4).
To examine why the dynamics of ALDH1-positive cells
are more important in metastases than in primary lesions,
we evaluated the difference in drug responsiveness
between ALDH1-positive cells from the primary lesion
and metastatic ALDH1-positive cells after NAC. First, we
confined the groups analyzed to 45 patients who were
diagnosed preoperatively as ALDH1-positive by immunohistochemistry in CNB specimens. Of these 45
patients, there have been 19 deaths and 21 relapses; these
45 patients included 11 patients (24.4%) with ALDH1positive cells () in primary lesions after NAC and 34
patients (75.6%) with ALDH1-positive cells (þ). In the
11 patients who had ALDH1-positive cells () in the primary lesion after NAC, only 1 patient (9.1%) had
ALDH1-positive cells in an axillary lesion, and the other
10 patients (90.9%) had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in

Figure 3. These charts illustrate the clinical significance of residual pathologic metastases and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1
(ALDH1)-positive cells in axillary lesions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with breast cancer. (a) In pathologic
analyses of axillary lesions after NAC, the overall survival (OS) of patients who had residual axillary metastases (orange line) was
significantly shorter than that of patients who had no residual axillary metastases (blue line) (P ¼ .0019). (b) In an ALDH1 immunohistochemical analysis of axillary lesions after NAC, the OS of patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (red line) was significantly shorter than the OS of patients who had ALDH1-positive cells () (light blue line) (P < .0001). (c) In evaluations that
considered both pathologic residual metastases and ALDH1-positive cells in axillary lesions after NAC, the OS of patients who
had residual axillary metastases with ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (red line) was significantly shorter than the OS of patients who
had no residual axillary metastases (blue line) (P < .0001). The OS of patients who had residual axillary metastases with ALDH1positive cells () (purple line) was significantly longer than that in patients with ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (red line) (P < .0001),
and was not significantly different from that in patients with no residual axillary metastases (blue line) (P ¼ .188).

ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in the primary lesion after
NAC, 16 (43.1%) had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in axillary lesions, and the other 18 patients (56.9%) had
ALDH1-positive cells () in axillary lesions. Next, to
evaluate metastatic ALDH1-positive cells in axillary
lesions before NAC, we attempted reimmunohistochemistry of ALDH1 in preoperative cytologic samples from
axillary metastases using the cell-transfer technique. Of
the 45 patients analyzed, we succeeded in cell transfer of
38 samples, but we could not transfer sufficient amounts
of cells from 7 patients. Of the 38 patients for whom we
could perform reimmunohistochemistry of ALDH1, 30

lesions before NAC. Of these 30 patients, there have been
11 deaths and 12 relapses. Because we performed reimmunohistochemistry of ALDH1 only for patients who
were diagnosed preoperatively as ALDH1-positive by
immunohistochemistry in CNB specimens, our data did
not address whether all patients with ALDH1-positive
lymph nodes also had ALDH1-positive primary tumors
before chemotherapy. Of these 30 patients who had both
ALDH1-positive cells in the primary lesion and metastatic ALDH1-positive cells in axillary lesions confirmed
before NAC, 5 patients had ALDH1-positive cells () in
the primary lesion after NAC, and 25 patients had
ALDH1-positive cells (þ). In the 5 patients who had

after NAC, 9 patients (36%) had ALDH1-positive cells
() in axillary lesions after NAC, and 16 patients (64%)
had ALDH1-positive cells (þ). In these 25 patients with
residual ALDH1-positive cells in the primary lesion, the
OS of patients who experienced the disappearance of
ALDH1-positive cells in axillary metastases was significantly longer than the OS of patients without such disappearance (P ¼ .0015) (Fig. 4). These data suggest that,
even if ALDH1-positive cells remain in the primary
lesion, patients who experience the disappearance of
ALDH1-positive cells in axillary metastases after chemotherapy can achieve good prognosis.
Figure 4. Even if aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)-positive
cells remained in the primary lesion, patients in whom metastatic, ALDH1-positive cells disappeared after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NAC) had a good prognosis. Of 115 patients, 25
patients displayed both ALDH1-positive cells in the primary
lesion and metastatic, ALDH1-positive cells in axillary lesions
before NAC, and they had residual ALDH1-positive cells in the
primary lesion after NAC. Among these patients, the overall
survival of those who had ALDH1-positive cells () in axillary
lesions after NAC was significantly longer than the overall
survival of those who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) (P ¼ .0015).

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the prognostic significance of residual
ALDH1-positive cells in primary lesions, and particularly
in metastatic lesions, after NAC in patients with lymph
node-positive breast cancer. A subpopulation of cancer
cells with tumorigenic ability has been revealed in solid
tumors.6,10-15 This subpopulation, which has stem-like
characteristics in cancer tissue, is called cancer stem cells
or tumor-initiating cells.6,10-15 Traditionally, in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, we treated whole cancer cells
in the same manner. Because of the discovery of this subpopulation, we may revise our understanding of the
3907

handling of cancer cells in solid tumors. To apply this subpopulation in clinical settings, clarification of relations between
this subpopulation and chemotherapy is important.
Recently, it was reported that ALDH1-positive cells
had stem-like or progenitor ability in either normal breast
epithelium cells or breast cancer cells.20 ALDH1-positive
cells can be considered as a subpopulation with high proliferative potency in breast cancer tissue and are regarded
as a new diagnostic and therapeutic target in breast cancer
patients.20,22 This study used pre-NAC and post-NAC
samples from primary and metastatic lesions to evaluate
responsiveness to chemotherapy of the ALDH1-positive
subpopulation and the influence on prognosis in breast
cancer patients.
In recent years, pathologic complete remission
(pCR) of primary tumors and axillary lymph node metastases after NAC has been considered 1 of the goals of treatment for patients with breast cancer.24-29 By comparison,
patients who do not achieve pCR have been treated prognostically in the same manner, and no suitable clinical
goals have been identified for these patients. In the current
study, we evaluated residual ALDH1-positive cells in
addition to pathologic cancer cells after NAC in both
primary and metastatic lesions. In primary lesions after
NAC, separating patient status after NAC into 3 groups
of ‘‘no residual tumor,’’ ‘‘residual tumor with ALDH1positive cells (),’’ and ‘‘residual tumor with ALDH1positive cells (þ),’’ only patients who had residual tumor
with ALDH1-positive cells (þ) after NAC had a worse
prognosis compared with the other 2 groups. Furthermore, using the same evaluation for metastatic lesions,
only patients who had ALDH1-positive cells (þ) in residual axillary metastases after NAC had a worse prognosis
compared with the other 2 groups. These data indicate
that only residual ALDH1-positive cells after NAC represent a prognostic factor in patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. Our data were derived from detailed
analyses of primary and metastatic lesions before and after
NAC in a single institution. One of the limitations in this
study was the small sample size. Patients with ALDH1positive cells (þ) in primary and metastatic lesions after
NAC clearly had a worse prognosis. In contrast, according
to our data, no prognostic difference was apparent
between patients who had no residual tumor and those
who had residual tumor with ALDH1-positive cells ().
This suggests the interesting notion that, if pathologic
tumor and metastases remain after NAC, then patients
with ALDH1-positive cells () are prognostically similar
to patients who attain pCR. However, this result may
have been attributable to our small sample size, and evalu3908

ation in a larger sample is required. The rate of ALDH1positve cells in the primary tumor before NAC (39.1%)
in this study was higher than that in a previous report
(19%).20 In our current study, we evaluated patients with
advanced breast cancer who had cytologically confirmed
axillary lymph node metastases. The reason for the high
rate of ALDH1-positve cells in primary tumor may be
because of differences in patient selection for this
study. In recent therapy for breast cancer, trastuzumab for
Her2-positive patients and antihormone therapy for
ER-positive and PR-positive patients are clinically important.30-32 Combined therapy with chemotherapy and trastuzumab for patients with Her2-positive breast cancer
reportedly raises the rate of pCR after NAC.33 No
patients in our study received trastuzumab; thus, we could
not evaluate the influence of trastuzumab on ALDH1positive cells. In addition, the length of observation in this
study was insufficient to evaluate the efficiency of hormone therapy. Therefore, our data mainly reflect the
influence of chemotherapy, and the therapeutic efficacy of
trastuzumab and hormone therapy on ALDH1-positive
cells remains to be clarified.
This study also demonstrated that only ALDH1positive cells in residual axillary metastases were correlated
with OS in multivariate analysis. Residual ALDH1-positive cells in metastatic lesions had superior prognostic
significance compared with ALDH1-positive cells in primary lesions. Furthermore, our analyses in selected
patients who had ALDH1-positive cells in both primary
and metastatic lesions before NAC produced 3 interesting
results. First, in some patients, ALDH1-positive cells disappeared after NAC in primary or axillary metastatic
lesions. Second, the rate of disappearance for ALDH1positive cells after NAC was higher in axillary metastatic
lesions than in primary lesions. Third, in patients who
had residual ALDH1-positive cells after NAC in primary
lesions, the OS for patients who experienced the disappearance of ALDH1-positive cells from axillary metastatic
lesions after NAC was longer than the OS for patients
who had residual ALDH1-positive cells. The finding that
ALDH1-positive cells, particularly in metastatic lesions,
had a complete response to chemotherapy is clinically
important. In patients with ALDH1-positive cells, the
pCR rate was low, as noted by Tanei et al.21 However,
in these patients who did not achieve pCR, those who
experienced the disappearance of ALDH1-positive cells
after NAC had a good prognosis. These findings suggest
that ALDH1-positive cells in axillary lesions offer a
surrogate marker for patients with lymph node-positive
breast cancer.

In addition, ALDH1-positive cells in residual metastases, but not residual primary tumor, were correlated
with OS in multivariate analysis. However, the hazard
ratio of ALDH1-positive cells in residual metastases
(11.575) and of ALDH1-positive cells in residual primary
tumor (10.044) was almost the same in univariate analysis. The presence of ALDH1-positive cells in residual primary tumor also was an important prognostic factor in
patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. These
data may be results from a small sample; and, as mentioned above, evaluation and confirmation in a larger
sample are needed. Moreover, in general, the drug responsiveness of lymph node metastases and distant organ
metastases are not similar in breast cancer patients.34,35
We should not equate lymph node metastases with distant
organ metastases as targets of chemotherapy. However,
given the substantially different environment from the
primary lesion, the finding that the prognostic significance of ALDH1-positive cells in axillary lesions was
superior to that in primary lesions is clinically important.
In conclusion, the responsiveness of ALDH1-positive cells to chemotherapy in primary and metastatic
lesions and its associated prognostic significance were
revealed in patients with breast cancer. ALDH1-positive
cells may represent a surrogate marker as a new concept in
patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. In the
future, ALDH1-positive cells may be used for diagnosis
and treatment, and these cell populations could be
targeted in the development of new chemotherapies. We
hope that our results will provide basic data for therapies
targeting cell subpopulations in tumors, rather than the
whole body, in patients with noncurable, metastatic breast
cancer.
