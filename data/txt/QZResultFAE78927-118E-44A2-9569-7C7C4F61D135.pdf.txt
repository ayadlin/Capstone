BACKGROUND. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a biologically heterogeneous subgroup of lymphomas with poor prognosis. In this study, the authors
analyzed the clinical behaviors of PTCLs and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL).

METHODS. The authors compared the characteristics and outcomes of 59 patients
with PTCLs, including 33 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas and 26 unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphomas, with the characteristics and outcomes of 193
patients with DLBCLs who were treated in the era before rituximab.

RESULTS. Based on the clinical characteristics, elevated lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), poor PS, advanced stage, higher International Prognostic Index score, and
B symptoms were more common in patients with PTCLs, and bulky mass was

patients with DLBCL (P ¼ .001, P < .001, and P ¼ .003, respectively). Although
multivariate analysis identified several risk factors that were significant in PTCLs,
but not in DLBCLs, for the CR/CRu, OS, PFS, and DFS rates, the immunophenotype was not identified as a risk factor.

CONCLUSIONS. The poor response and survival of patients who had PTCLs, compared with patients who had DLBCL, was caused by numerous initial risk factors.
T-cell phenotype itself did not appear to have a significant impact on either
response or survival. Cancer 2007;109:1146–51.  2007 American Cancer Society.

T

he collective term peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) is used
for mature T-cell neoplasms derived from post-thymic T-cells.
PTCLs are recognized as 1 of the subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that accounts for 20% to 25% of NHL in Japan,1
although their incidence varies geographically in the world.2
Because of the rarity of their incidence, the characteristics and outcomes of PTCLs have not been explored well. The acceptance of the
World Health Organization (WHO) classification3 of NHL, which
focused on the normal counterparts of lymphoma cells, helped focus
greater attention on these disorders. These include relatively frequent subtypes of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL),
peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (PTCLu), anaplastic large
cell lymphoma (ALCL), adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia, and other
rare subtypes. The former 3 subtypes are likely to be involved in

lymph node lesions and are called nodal PTCLs.
Because it is known that patients with ALCL have an
exceptionally favorable prognosis among patients
with PTCLs,4 they have been excluded from recent
studies that compared PTCLs with diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL),2,5 which is the most common and well studied subtype.
The outcome of patients with PTCLs usually is
reported as unfavorable compared with the outcome
of patients with DLBCL; however, few clinical studies
have investigated whether the immunophenotype
itself leads to the resistance to anticancer drugs. In
this study, we retrospectively analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of consecutive patients with
PTCLs compared with those of patients with DLBCL.
The analysis included elderly patients, who generally
have been precluded from such clinical studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The population for this study comprised 59 untreated
patients who were diagnosed with PTCLs between
1994 and 2005 and 193 untreated patients with
DLBCL who were diagnosed between 1998 and 2002
at Yokohama City University Hospital and affiliated
hospitals. These patients were registered consecutively in our hospitals. Histologic specimens from all
252 patients were reviewed by hematopathologists,
including 1 of the authors (K.T.) according to the
WHO classification.3 The PTCL group consisted of 33
patients with AITL and 26 patients with PTCLu.
Patients with ALCL were not included in the study.
The patients ranged in age from 34 years to 83 years
(median, 63 years) in patients with PTCLs and from
18 years to 87 years (median, 62 years) in patients
with DLBCL. The outcome of patients with DLBCL
aged < 80 years was reported previously.6 The median follow-up for survivors was 28 months in
patients with PTCLs and 56 months in patients with
DLBCL. Clinical staging was performed according to
the Ann Arbor system7 based on physical examination;
computed tomography scans of the cervix, chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and bone marrow aspiration and
biopsy. If necessary, endoscopic examination of the
upper and/or lower gastrointestinal tract, lumbar
puncture, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain,
gallium scintigram, and positron emission tomography
were added to the staging procedure.
Although the initial treatment strategy has undergone detailed revisions over the years, it was the
same for both patients with PTCLs and patients with
DLBCL at the time. For example, based on application of the International Prognostic Index (IPI)8 to patients aged <61 years, combined cyclophosphamide,

1147

doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy (CHOP) was administered to low-risk patients;
and ACOMP-B9 chemotherapy (a third-generation
regimen similar to combined methotrexate with
leucovorin rescue, CHOP, plus bleomycin) was administered to low/intermediate-risk patients. Up-front
autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was performed in high/intermediate- and highrisk patients. Rituximab was not used at least for the
initial treatment of DLBCL. The response was evaluated based on the International Workshop Criteria10
reported in 1999. In patients who were diagnosed
before 1999, the response was re-evaluated retrospectively by the attending physicians according to
the above-mentioned criteria. For patients who attained a complete response (CR) or an uncertain CR
(CRu) in the presence of an initial bulky mass
(defined as a greatest tumor dimension 10 cm or
33% of the greatest thoracic dimension in patients
with a mediastinal mass), the attending physician
then decided in a nonrandomized manner whether
40 grays of adjuvant, involved-field radiotherapy
should be administered locally. Overall survival (OS)
was measured as the interval between the date of
treatment initiation and the date of death or last
follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured as the interval between the date of treatment
initiation and the date of death from any cause or
disease progression. Disease-free survival (DFS)
applied only to patients who had a CR/CRu and was
defined as the interval between the date of the
evaluation of CR/CRu and the date of death from
any cause or the date of recurrence.
The clinical characteristics of the patients with
PTCLs and DLBCL were compared based on factors
such as sex, age (>60 years vs 60 years), serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration (greater
than the upper limit of normal vs normal), performance status (PS) (2–4 vs 0–1), clinical stage according
to the Ann Arbor classification (stage III or IV vs
stage I or II), number of sites of extranodal involvement (EN) (2 vs <2), IPI,8 bone marrow involvement (present vs absent), B symptoms (present vs
absent), and bulky mass (present vs absent). Data for
all of the above-mentioned factors were available
from all 252 patients.

Statistical Analysis
The Fisher exact-probability test and the chi-square
test were used to determine statistically significant
differences between the characteristics of the groups.
A survival curve was constructed using the KaplanMeier method, and the groups were compared using
the log-rank test. Logistic regression analysis and

Cox regression analysis were used to identify the risk
factors for CR/CRu and survival, respectively. P values
< .05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
The results of this analysis indicated that elevated
LDH (P < .001), poor PS (P ¼ .02), advanced stage
(P < .001), higher IPI (P < .001), and B symptoms
(P < .001) were observed more frequently in patients
with PTCLs than in patients with DLBCL (Table 1).
Bulky mass was observed more frequently in patients
with DLBCL than in patients with PTCLs (P ¼ .01).

The response to initial treatment was as follows:
Among the patients with PTCLs, 33 patients achieved
a CR/CRu (56%), 9 patients had a partial response
(15%), 5 patients had stable disease (9%), and 12
patients developed progressive disease (20%). Among
the patients with DLBCL, 138 patients achieved a
CR/CRu (72%), 26 patients had a partial response
(13%), 6 patients had stable disease (3%), and 23
patients developed progressive disease (12%).
The subgroup analysis of PTCLs yielded the following results. Compared with patients who had
PTCLu, patients with AITL showed the characteristic
advanced stage (P ¼ .001) and the absence of bulky
masses (P ¼ .008); however, the other characteristics
were similar for both subgroups of patients. The
CR/CRu rate did not differ significantly between
patients with AITL and patients with PTCLu (61% vs
50%, respectively). Furthermore, no differences were
observed in OS, PFS, and DFS rates between patients
with AITL and patients with PTCLu (data not shown).
In the 59 patients with PTCLs, 33 deaths were
recorded; the cause of death was lymphoma in 25
patients (76%), infection in 5 patients (15%), gastrointestinal perforation in 1 patient (3%), bleeding in 1
patient (3%), and other malignancy in 1 patient (3%).
A CR/CRu was observed more frequently in patients with DLBCL (72%) than in patients with PTCLs
(56%; P ¼ .03). The OS was significantly shorter
in patients with PTCLs than in patients with DLBCL
(5-year OS rate, 31% and 59%, respectively; P ¼ .001)
(Fig. 1A). The PFS was significantly shorter in patients
with PTCLs than in patients with DLBCL (5-year PFS
rate, 26% and 55%, respectively; P < .001) (Fig. 1B).
The PFS curve in patients with PTCLs appeared to
show a plateau after an observation period of 3 years.
The DFS in patients who achieved a CR/CRu also
was shorter in patients with PTCLs than in patients
with DLBCL (5-year DFS rate, 47% and 73%, respectively; P ¼ .003) (Fig. 1C). The DFS curve in patients
with PTCLs also showed a plateau after a CR/CRu
duration of 2 years.
Logistic regression analysis for CR/CRu identified
elevated LDH as the only independent factor that
was observed more frequently in patients with PTCLs
than in patients with DLBCL (Table 2). The immunophenotype was not a predictive factor for CR/CRu. A
Cox regression analysis of the risk factors for OS
identified age >60 years, elevated LDH, poor PS,
advanced stage, and multiple sites of EN as independent risk factors, which constitute the 5 risk
factors included in the IPI (Table 3). Among these
5 risk factors, elevated LDH, poor PS, and advanced
stage were observed more frequently in patients with
PTCLs than in patients with DLBCL (Table 1). The

>60 years and elevated LDH (Table 5). The immunophenotype was not predictive for OS, PFS, or DFS. In
contrast, elevated LDH, which was observed more
frequently in patients with PTCLs than in patients
with DLBCL, proved to be an unfavorable predictor
for all of response for OS, PFS, and DFS.

WHO classification,3 AITL and PTCLu were compared with DLBCL. These 2 histologic subtypes form
a major proportion of peripheral T-NHL in Japan,
excluding adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia.1 ALCL—
another common histologic subtype of T-NHL—was
not included in this study because of its relatively
favorable prognosis.4 In a subgroup analysis of patients with PTCLu, although patients with AITL had
more advanced disease and less bulky masses than
those observed in patients with PTCLu, the other
characteristics of these patients were similar. Furthermore, the rates of CR/CRu, OS, PFS, and DFS did not

DISCUSSION
In the current investigation, we tried to elucidate the
clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with
aggressive T-cell NHL (T-NHL) compared with those
of patients with aggressive B-cell NHL. Based on the

PTCLs vs DLBCL/Tomita et al.

differ significantly between patients with AITL and
patients with PTCLu (data not shown). Therefore, we
judged it reasonable to compare the 2 histologic
subtypes along with DLBCL. The histologic specimens from all 252 patients were reviewed by expert
hematopathologists. Because the current study was
retrospective in nature and included consecutive
patients with PTCLs and DLBCL, it included some
patients who were treated without curative intent
because of their poor general state. Therefore, the
current study included a high percentage of patients
aged 60 years in both the PTCLs group (64%) and
the DLBCL group (53%). We believe that our consecutive cohort reflects the clinical pictures of the 2 diseases more practically than what has been reflected
in clinical trials that excluded elderly patients.
Regarding the effect of immunophenotype on
patient outcomes, although some earlier studies that
were based on the older classification systems
reported similar prognoses between patients with Band T-cell lymphomas,11–14 most recent studies consistently have demonstrated a negative impact of the
T-cell phenotype on OS.5,15,16 This may be caused in
part by the inclusion of patients with ALCL in the
earlier studies. In a recent comparative study of 297
patients with PTCLu and 496 patients with DLBCL,
Morabito et al. reported that the immunophenotype
was associated independently with response, but not
with survival.5 Even in our study, although the rates
of CR/CRu, OS, PFS, and DFS were unfavorable for
patients who had PTCLs comprised of AITL and
PTCLu in univariate analysis, the immunophenotype
was not associated independently with the rates of
CR/CRu, OS, PFS, and DFS (P ¼ .48, P ¼ .77, P ¼ .80,
and P ¼ .91, respectively). In addition, a DFS of
2 years may be useful for predicting stable remission
of disease in patients with PTCLs.
In conclusion, in consecutive cohorts with the
same treatment strategy, patients with PTCLs had
unfavorable outcomes in terms of the CR/CRu rate
and survival compared with patients who had DLBCL.
This difference should be attributed mainly to the
numerous initial risk factors and not to the immunophenotype itself in the era before rituximab. Further
analysis will be required now that rituximab is
accepted widely for the treatment of DLBCL.
