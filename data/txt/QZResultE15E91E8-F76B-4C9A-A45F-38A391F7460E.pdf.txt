ABSTRACT
Proteases contribute to cancer in many ways, including tumor vascularization
and metastasis, and their pharmacological inhibition is a potential anticancer strategy.
We report that human endothelial cells (EC) express the trypsinogen 4 isoform
of the serine protease 3 (PRSS3), and lack both PRSS2 and PRSS1. Trypsinogen
4 expression was upregulated by the combined action of VEGF-A, FGF-2 and EGF,
angiogenic factors representative of the tumor microenvironment. Suppression of
trypsinogen 4 expression by siRNA inhibited the angiogenic milieu-induced migration
of EC from cancer specimens (tumor-EC), but did not affect EC from normal tissues.
We identified tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), a matrix associated inhibitor
of cell motility, as the functional target of trypsinogen 4, which cleaved TFPI-2 and
removed it from the matrix put down by tumor-EC. Silencing tumor-EC for trypsinogen
4 accumulated TFPI2 in the matrix.
Showing that angiogenic factors stimulate trypsinogen 4 expression, which
hydrolyses TFPI-2 favoring a pro-migratory situation, our study suggests a new
pathway linking tumor microenvironment signals to endothelial cell migration, which
is essential for angiogenesis and blood vessel remodeling. Abolishing trypsinogen 4
functions might be an exploitable strategy as anticancer, particularly anti-vascular,
therapy.

INTRODUCTION

proteases contributing to cancer are the serine proteases
[2]. An association between serine protease 3 (PRSS3)
expression and a worse prognosis in cancer patients have
been recently shown by microarray data [3-5], but its role
in the patho-physiology of tumors is mostly unknown.
PRSS3 is an atypical member of the trypsinogen family,
unaffected by the naturally occurring polypeptide trypsin
inhibitors and capable of degrading the Kunitz-type family
of serine protease inhibitors [6, 7]. The PRSS3 gene
encodes two proteins, mesotrypsinogen and trypsinogen
4 [7]. Mesotrypsinogen is the minor component of the
secreted pancreatic trypsinogens (approximately 0.5% of
the total proteins in human pancreatic juice). Trypsinogen

Endothelial cells (EC) line the blood vessels
and regulate important physiological and pathological
processes such as angiogenesis, metastasis and blood
coagulation. Proteases secreted by EC, and in particular
perivascular proteases, influence neo-vascularization
by activating growth factors and modifying membrane
receptors which can induce EC and mural cell migration
[1]. Understanding how protease activities regulate
EC response to microenvironment signals might help
to identify new way to inhibit neo-vascularization in
cancer and angiogenesis-related diseases. Among the

4 is required for the migration of tumor-EC promoted by
the tumor microenvironment, and exerts its pro-angiogenic
action through the inhibition of the tissue factor pathway
inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2).

4 is “extra-pancreatic” and is found in the brain, expressed
by a subset of neuronal and glial cells (mainly astrocytes).
It is also expressed at much lower levels in other tissues
and in some human epithelial cell lines [8-11]. To date, the
physiological role of trypsinogen 4 is unknown.
We had shown by in situ hybridization that the in
vivo expression of PRSS3 transcript is associated with the
tumor vasculature [12]. In the present study, we extend
our previous findings and report that trypsinogen 4 is the
trypsin family member expressed by the EC, and that a
pro-angiogenic environment enhances its expression.
It is known that proteases (secreted and membranebound) break down extracellular matrix and cellular
adhesion molecules, facilitating angiogenesis, invasion,
and metastasis [13, 14]. Here we used EC isolated from
cancer specimens (tumor-EC) and show that trypsinogen

RESULTS
Endothelial cells express the trypsinogen 4
isoform of serine protease-3 (PRSS3)
An earlier investigation suggested that human
endothelial cells (EC) from umbilical vein (HUVEC) and
derma (dMvEC) express serine protease-2 (PRSS2) [15].
Our microarray analyses have suggested that PRSS3 is

enzymes were separated by gel electrophoresis. The lower panels show the results for two representative EC populations, demonstrating
that only PvuII can cut, hence indicating that only PRSS3 is expressed. B: Endothelial cells express PRSS3, specifically the trypsinogen
4 isoform. The 5’ terminus alignment of PRSS3, trypsinogen 4 and mesotrypsinogen, is shown with the common (Df, Dr and Er) and the
specific (E1 and E2) primers for the different isoforms. The gel electrophoresis pictures show the PCR product of the expected length for
PRSS3 (170 bp; top panel) and for trypsinogen 4 (345 bp; middle panel) and the lack of mesotrypsinogen amplification (191 bp; bottom
panel) for a number of representative EC populations. (Positive control, HT29 colon cancer cells [10]; negative control, no template).

expressed by EC and from cancer specimens (tumor-EC)
[12]. This induced us to isolate tumor-EC (Supplementary
Figure 1) to be investigated.

Restriction enzyme digestion analyses indicated
that PRSS3 is expressed by tumor-EC while PRSS1
and PRSS2 are not. As shown in Figure 1A (middle

from human cancer and non-neoplastic tissues were exposed (+, black) or not (-, white) to the in vitro reconstituted “angiogenic milieu”
(i.e. human recombinant VEGF-A, FGF-2 and EGF) and trypsinogen 4 expression was assayed by RT-qPCR. A: The angiogenic milieu
up-regulates trypsinogen 4 expression by EC. The trypsinogen 4 relative expression was quantified for each biological sample according
to the comparative DDCt method by arbitrarily assuming as “the reference” calibrator the DCt mean value of the EC from non-neoplastic
tissue not exposed to the angiogenic milieu. Shown here are the results of 9 different tumor-EC (isolated from 8 ovarian and 1 kidney
carcinoma), and 5 normal tissue-EC (isolated from 3 adrenal gland, 1 skin and 1 lung specimens). B: Trypsinogen 4 is expressed more by
tumor than non-neoplastic EC. The box plot shows the DCt values of the tumor-EC (N = 9) and the normal tissues-EC (N = 5) and the
statistical analysis results (one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni Multiple Comparison Test). C: Trypsinogen 4 up-regulation is measurable
after 24 hours. Shown here is the expression of trypsinogen 4 by representative ovarian tumor-EC from carcinoma (HOC-EC) embedded or
not in the angiogenic milieu for different times. The grey column (time 0) represents the baseline trypsinogen 4 expression (before exposing
the cells to the experimental conditions). D: The matrix protein fibronectin does not affect trypsinogen 4 expression. Shown here is the
expression of trypsinogen 4 by a representative HOC-EC seeded on either CollagenI or CollagenI plus plasma fibronectin coated tissue

picture, HOC-EC) PvuII was able to cut the amplicon
while PstI, SacI and XhoI did not, a result fitting only
with the PRSS3 sequence. Accordingly, RT-qPCR using
PRSS1 or PRSS2 TaqMan specific assays did not result
in transcript amplification, while the use of PRSS3 assay
did (Supplementary Table 2). This finding was confirmed
using primers designed to specifically amplify PRSS3,
whereby gel electrophoresis revealed amplification of
a PCR product of the expected length (Figure 1B, top
picture, HOC-EC).
The PRSS3 gene gives rise to either
mesotrypsinogen or trypsinogen 4 mRNAs, which share
exons 2 through 5 but differ in exon 1. Gel electrophoresis
of PCR products obtained using specific primers for each
isoform, showed that tumor-EC expressed trypsinogen
4 but not mesotrypsinogen (Figure 1B, bottom pictures,
HOC-EC and HK-EC).
Similarly, EC from normal tissues, such as skin,
adrenal glands (HA-EC), derma and lung (D- and
L-HMVEC), expressed PRSS3/trypsinogen 4 but not
PRSS1 and PRSS2 (Figure 1A bottom picture and Figure
1B).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that
trypsinogen 4 is the trypsin isoform expressed by the
human endothelium.

test whether trypsinogen 4 had a role in the increased
migration of tumor-EC, we suppressed its transcription
using short-interfering RNA (siRNA). Trypsinogen
4-proficient HOC-EC (both wild type and transfected
with non silencing (NT) siRNA) closed the wound in
20 hours (Figure 3B), while trypsinogen 4-deficient
HOC-EC migrated much more slowly (the wound width
decreased by only 50% after 24 hours). In contrast, the
delay in wound closure by trypsinogen 4-deficient normalEC from derma (D-HMVEC) and lung (L-HMVEC)
was negligible (Figure 3C). Altogether these results
demonstrate that in presence of an angiogenic milieu,
the depletion of trypsinogen 4 profoundly impairs the
migratory capabilities of tumor-EC, while it does not
affect the migration of EC from normal tissues.
In the absence of the angiogenic milieu (Figure 3D),
trypsinogen 4-deficient and proficient HOC-EC migrated
equally poorly, suggesting that the microenvironment has
a profound influence on the level of trypsinogen 4 required
to boost tumor-EC migration.
To further demonstrate that the angiogenic milieu
was able to stimulate the migration of tumor-EC by
increasing trypsinogen 4 expression, HOC-EC were
transfected with trypsinogen 4 siRNA and seeded either
with or without the angiogenic milieu (VEGF-A, FGF2 and EGF), and their ability to repair the wound was
measured at two different time points. The migration of
HOC-EC wounded 16 h after transfection, when maximum
silencing was achieved (Figure 4C), was unaffected
by the angiogenic milieu (Figure 4A). In contrast, the
angiogenic milieu enhanced the migration of HOC-EC
wounded 48 h after transfection (Figure 4B), the time at
which the silencing effect was fading and the expression
of trypsinogen 4 was partially restored (Figure 4C).
These findings demonstrate that when the ability
of tumor-EC to up-regulate trypsinogen 4 is impaired,
they are no longer capable of migrating in response
to the angiogenic stimulus provided by the tumor
microenvironment.

Tumor-EC over-express trypsinogen4: effect of
the microenvironment
To assess the effect of the microenvironment on
the expression of trypsinogen 4, we examined EC in two
different culture conditions: either in presence of stimuli
mimicking the tumor microenvironment, or in their
absence to copy the non-neoplastic setting.
VEGF-A, FGF-2 and EGF, factors which
characterize the angiogenic milieu, were able to
significantly increase trypsinogen 4 expression by tumorEC (Figure 2A and 2B). The up-regulation was measurable
after 24h of exposure and was maintained at 72h (Figure
2C), regardless of fibronectin (Figure 2D). Similarly, EC
from normal tissues reacted to the angiogenic milieu upregulating trypsinogen 4, but the amount of the transcript
remained significantly lower in comparison to tumor-EC
(Figure 2A and 2B); indeed it was similar to that of tumorEC in absence of the angiogenic milieu.

Trypsinogen 4 enhances tumor-EC migration by
acting on tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI-2)
To clarify the mechanism by which trypsinogen
4 affects the migratory capacity of tumor-EC, we
investigated its relationship with TFPI-2. TFPI-2, a
Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, is expressed by EC
and has anti-angiogenic properties [16]; characteristics
that elected TFPI-2 as a possible substrate and effector of
trypsinogen 4.
We found that trypsinogen 4-deficient HOC-EC
had much more TFPI-2 protein than their trypsinogen
4-proficient counterpart (Figure 5A), although this was
not reflected by a difference in the amount of transcript
(Figure 5A). The protein was found in the total lysate but
it was undetectable in the cells, in line with a previous

report showing that most of the TFPI-2 was released
and remained in the extracellular matrix (ECM) [17].
Accordingly, much more TFPI-2 accumulated in the ECM
deposited by the slowly migrating HOC-EC silenced
for trypsinogen 4 (Figure 5A). In line with this, TFPI-2silenced HOC-EC migrated much faster and by 24h they
had completely closed the wound, while TFPI-2-proficient
HOC-EC only halved the wound width (Figure 5B). These
results suggest that trypsinogen 4 promotes tumor-EC
migration by displacing TFPI-2 from the matrix.
To substantiate this hypothesis, first we investigated
the proteolytic activity of trypsinogen 4 on TFPI-2.
Recombinant human TFPI-2 (rhTFPI-2) and active
trypsinogen 4 (rhPRSS3) proteins were incubated in a cellfree system and the proteolysis of TFPI-2 was monitored
by western blot. In a time course experiment, rhPRSS3
cleaved rhTFPI-2, and a number of proteolytic fragments
were visible after 5 minutes (Figure 5C, top and middle
panels). No spontaneous cleavage was detected in the
reaction containing only rhTFPI-2 (Figure 5C, bottom
panel), thus demonstrating the direct proteolytic activity
of trypsin 4 on TFPI-2.
Next we determined whether trypsinogen 4 could
cleave TFPI-2 in a complex biological sample, such as the
matrix of tumor-EC. HOC-EC were allowed to deposit
TFPI-2 rich ECM, which was then incubated for 1 hour
with active trypsinogen 4 (rhPRSS3). We observed a
concentration-dependent depletion of intact TFPI-2 from
the ECM, starting from rhPRSS3 concentrations as low as
1nM (Figure 5D).
Altogether these results indicated that trypsinogen
4 can reduce the extracellular availability of TFPI-2 to
favor the migration of tumor-EC mediated by the tumor

microenvironment.

DISCUSSION
The tumor milieu is a complex and highly dynamic
environment, providing important signals for tumor
development and progression. During tumor angiogenesis
and blood vessel remodeling, endothelial cells (EC) form
new vasculature in response to environmental cues. These
processes primarily require perivascular proteases, such
as proteinases/matrix metalloproteinases produced by the
EC [1].
The present study identifies the proteolytic cleavage
of extracellular TFPI-2 by trypsinogen 4 as a new pathway
regulating the response of tumor endothelial cell to the
factors VEGF-A, FGF-2 and EGF (which characterize
the angiogenic milieu), and hence tumor angiogenesis
(Figure 6). Our results demonstrate for the first time that i)
endothelial cells express the trypsinogen 4 isoform of the
serine protease PRSS3; ii) trypsinogen 4 cleaves TFPI-2,
and iii) displaces it from the extracellular matrix of tumorEC; iv) the angiogenic milieu dictates the up-regulation
of trypsinogen 4 which is essential for the migration of
tumor-EC.
Our findings clearly point to PRSS3 as the trypsin
family member expressed by the human endothelium.
A previous study [15] suggested that PRSS2 was the
main type of trypsin expressed by HUVEC and MvEC.
However, the PRSS3 sequence was not fully characterized
at that time, so PRSS2 could not be distinguished from
PRSS3. In light of the new knowledge we are providing,
those results are fully compatible with the expression of
PRSS3.

later (expression by NT siRNA HOC-EC was arbitrarily assumed as reference). Three different HOC-EC populations were investigated
(populations 23, 25 and 27); shown here are representative results. A: Trypsinogen 4-silenced tumor-EC have a much larger amount of
TFPI-2 protein. Protein lysates were prepared 24 hours after transfection. Western blot analysis was done to assess TFPI-2 protein in the
total lysate, in the cells and in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Tubulin was used as internal control. Migration was assessed by a wound
healing assay. B: TFPI-2-silenced tumor-EC close the wound faster. The wound healing assay was done 24h after transfection and wound
closure was monitored by Cell® Imaging Station. TFPI-2 protein was quantified by Western blot analysis. C: Active trypsinogen 4 cleaves
TFPI-2 in a cell-free system. Recombinant human TFPI-2 (500 nM) was incubated at 37°C with 20 nM of active recombinant human PRSS3
(rhPRSS3). The reaction was stopped at the times indicated and the TFPI-2 protein was analysed by western blot. The arrows indicate the
different TFPI-2 digestion products. Short and long membrane exposure time are shown to better illustrate how intact rhTFPI-2 fades (two
bands, top panel) and the appearance of a number of lower molecular weight products (middle panel). The same amount of TFPI-2 was
incubated at 37°C without trypsinogen 4 (bottom panel, long exposure). D: Active trypsinogen 4 displaces TFPI-2 from the extracellular
matrix of tumor-EC. The extracellular matrix deposited by HOC-EC was incubated for 1h at 37°C with different concentrations of rhPRSS3

The gene encoding PRSS3 gives rise to two main
variants, mesotrypsinogen and trypsinogen 4 [8, 18]. We
found that the endothelial cells express trypsinogen 4,
consistent with the notion that this isoform is expressed
by extra-pancreatic tissues [7]. The active forms of
mesotrypsinogen and trypsinogen 4 are identical [9,
18], and the variability present in the N-terminal regions
supposedly account for differences in tissue specificity,
cellular localization, and extracellular transport, although
the role and activity of trypsinogen 4 are mostly unknown.
To our knowledge, this is the first report directly
implicating trypsinogen 4 in endothelial functions, as
one of the proteases mediating signals initiated by the
tumor microenvironment. Trypsinogen 4 did not affect
proliferation, but its depletion markedly impaired the
migration of tumor-EC elicited by a pro-angiogenic
environment. In this study we investigated the events
that link trypsinogen 4 and endothelial cell migration,
demonstrating that trypsinogen 4 decreases the ECMassociated TFPI-2 availability. TFPI-2 is a member of

the Kunitz-type family of serine protease inhibitors that
is constitutively synthesized and secreted in the ECM by
human endothelial cells [17]. TFPI-2 has been shown to
inhibit tumor angiogenesis [19], most likely by directly
decreasing EC migration [20]. Our results not only
confirm previous finding, but also demonstrate for the
first time that TFPI-2 is a direct substrate of trypsinogen
4 which most likely hydrolyses TFPI-2 at the Kunitz-type
domains. The proteolytic cleavage leads to the inactivation
of TFPI-2, thus blocking its ability to inhibit the migration
of tumor-EC.
TFPI-2 has been described as a tumor suppressor
gene that can counteract the metastatic potential of tumor
cells [21]. Accordingly, its down-regulation in malignant
cells, by either histone deacetylation or promoter
hypermethylation, has been associated with disease
progression [22, 23]. Hence, the proteolytic inactivation
of TFPI-2 by trypsinogen 4 might represent an additional
“Loss of Function” mechanism favoring cancer by
increasing angiogenesis.

Figure 6: Tumor endothelium manages angiogenesis and blood vessel remodeling through the angiogenic factorsmediated trypsinogen 4 up-regulation and cleavage of extracellular TFPI-2. The cartoon shows the proposed scenario: the

tumor microenvironment (VEGF-A, FGF-2 and EGF provided by the cancer cells and stroma) triggers and sustains the expression of
trypsinogen 4 by the endothelium. Upon secretion and activation, trypsinogen 4 cleaves TFPI-2, particularly rich in the endothelial ECM.
The displacement of TPFI-2 permits EC migration and hence favors angiogenesis and blood vessel remodeling. The mechanism of release
and activation of trypsinogen 4 remains to be elucidated, although there is evidence indicating its activation by cathepsin B [7].

Active trypsin 4 has never been detected in cancer,
but few reports suggest the higher expression of PRSS3
(i.e. mRNA by microarray) associated with a worse
prognosis in NSCL, pancreatic, and prostate cancer [35]. Recent studies evaluating the consequences of PRSS3
over-expression or silencing in tumor cells indicated
that its activity favors tumor progression [4, 5, 24].
Trypsinogen 4 might therefore have more roles than our
current observations suggest and promote cancer through
multiple mechanisms, including enhancement of cancer
cells invasiveness necessary for metastasis, and endothelial
cell migration necessary for neovascularization.
Many proteolytic enzymes, are responsible for
reshaping the tumor microenvironment [1]. Their activity
is dictated by the formation of molecular and functional
networks occurring among proteases, their endogenous
inhibitors and substrata, as well as factors regulating
their expression and interaction including the crosstalk
with regulatory miRNA networks, as recently shown for
members of the trypsin-like kallikrein family [25]. Due
to this complexity, the contribution of each protease to
cancer-related biological processes is difficult to discern.
Our findings showing that depletion of trypsinogen 4
is sufficient to impair migration of tumor endothelial
cells suggest a major role for this protease in tumor
angiogenesis and blood vessel remodeling. Unfortunately,
the lack of trypsinogen 4 orthologues in mice and
zebrafish hinders the development of experimental models
to investigate its specific function in developmental and
pathologic angiogenesis.
We clearly demonstrated that both tumor- and
normal tissue- EC respond to the angiogenic milieu by
up-regulating trypsinogen 4, suggesting a gene expression
regulatory circuitry independent from the pathological
or anatomical origin of EC. Even so, trypsinogen 4
expression by tumor-EC is much higher than normal
tissue-EC and accordingly, it characterizes the cancer
vasculature in vivo [12]. EC must dynamically coordinate
changes concerning their crosstalk with the surroundings,
including when to start and stop moving [26]. Our
findings suggest that tumor-EC adapt to the persistent in
vivo stimulation of the tumor environment by modifying
their gene expression and phenotype, and at the same time
retain the ability to sense and respond to the changes in the
surroundings in a continuous process of vessel formation
and remodeling. Blocking the up-regulation of trypsinogen
4 hindered the migration of tumor-EC elicited by the
angiogenic milieu, whereas normal tissue-EC remain
unaffected. The specificity of this effect is important in
view of a selective therapy targeting the cancer vasculature
while sparing normal vascular districts to avoid adverse
effects.
The present study brings to light a previously
unrecognized pro-angiogenic role for trypsinogen 4
through the induction of tumor-EC migration, indicating
that this protease is a new, potential actionable target for

anti-vascular and anticancer treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation, culture and characterization of EC from
human tissues
EC were isolated from left-over neoplastic tissues
of patients undergoing therapeutic surgery, with their
full informed consent. Collection of tissue samples was
approved by the Local Scientific Ethical Committee (San
Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy) in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. EC isolation has been previously
described in detail [12, 27]. Briefly, tissue specimens were
digested by type I collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and the
suspension was plated onto Collagen I plus fibronectin
(BD Biosciences). Six to ten days later, EC were purified
using anti-CD31 antibody-coated magnetic beads (Life
Technologies) and cultured as described [12]. To confirm
their endothelial origin, cell cultures were analyzed for
the expression of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), plateletendothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31/PECAM-1),
and alpha-smooth muscle Actin (alpha-SMA) all by
immunohistochemistry, and also for the capability to
uptake low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The results are
reported in Supplementary Figure 1. Dermal and lung
human microvascular EC (D-HMVEC and L- HMVEC)
were purchased from Clonetics®.
For experimental purposes, EC were analyzed
in the presence or absence of an “angiogenic milieu”
reconstituted in vitro, namely human recombinant vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A; 10 ng/ml), fibroblast
growth factor-2 (FGF-2; 2 ng/ml) and epidermal growth
factor (EGF; 10 ng/ml) [12].

RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol® (Life
Technologies), potential genomic DNA contamination
was removed by DNAse (Ambion) treatment followed by
RNA CleanUp with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The purity and
integrity of the RNA were checked by gel electrophoresis
or by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies),
and the concentration was determined with NanoDrop
1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

RT-PCR and restriction digestion analysis
Primer sets for PCR amplification were designed
with Primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgibin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi) according to the target
sequences (Supplementary Table 1) and synthesized by

Sigma-Aldrich. One microgram of total RNA was reversetranscribed for 50 min at 42°C with SuperScriptTM
Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) and the reverse
primer. One or two μL were then PCR amplified in a 50
μL reaction mixture containing 200 nM primers, 200 µM
dNTPs, 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold and 1.5mM MgCl2. The
thermal condition was: denaturation at 94°C for 10 min,
amplification for 35 cycles (denaturation at 95°C for 30s,
annealing at 55°C for 30s, extension at 72°C for 30s), and
final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products
were separated by gel electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose
gel.
PCR products were gel-purified with Ultrafree DA
(Millipore), concentrated with Microcon YM-50 Device
(Millipore), and digested for 2h at 37°C with 10U of either
PstI, XhoI, PvuII or SacI (Roche Applied Science). The
digested fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis
in 1.2% agarose gel.

were plated and used for subsequent analyses. The
knockdown efficiency was assessed by RT-qPCR.

Wound-healing assays
Endothelial cells migration was assayed by the
wound healing assay [28], that is particularly suitable for
studies on the effects of EC interaction with extracellular
matrix (ECM). Briefly, EC (2.5x104 cells/insert well) were
seeded on fibronectin in Culture-Inserts (Ibidi) and let to
form a monolayer before removing the culture-insert to
obtain a cell-free gap of 500 µm. Each well was rinsed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fresh medium
(with or without the angiogenic milieu as indicated) was
added. The closure of the gap was monitored by Cell^R
- Imaging Station (Olympus) and pictures were acquired
every 30 min for 24-48h. Migration was quantified using
Image J software (imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)

TFPI-2 hydrolysis

One microgram of total RNA was reversetranscribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit and Random Hexamer primers (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. A
control RT reaction was set up for each sample without
the reverse transcriptase. Quantitative RT-PCR reactions
were done in duplicate on the 7900HT Fast Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Specific TaqMan®
Gene Expression Assays were purchased from Applied
Biosystems (Supplementary Table 2). PRSS1, PRSS2,
PRSS3 and TFPI-2 expression was normalized to the
human 18s rRNA for each EC population (DCt = Ct
- Ct 18s). The DCt were statistically analysed by
target gene
one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni Multiple
Comparison Test to compare EC isolated from neoplastic
and normal tissues. Fold differences were calculated by
the comparative DDCt method.

The direct hydrolysis of TFPI-2 by PRSS3 was
monitored in a time course experiment, incubating 500 nM
recombinant human TFPI-2 (rhTFPI-2, R&D Systems)
with 20 nM active recombinant human PRSS3 (rhPRSS3,
R&D Systems) at 37°C in assay buffer (50mM Tris, 0.15M
NaCl, 10mM CaCl2, 0.05% Brj-35, pH 7.5), following the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Samples were drawn at
intervals, mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, denatured
and stored at -20°C until Western blot analysis.
The PRSS3 depletion/displacement of TFPI-2 from
the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by EC was also
checked. The ECM was obtained according to a previously
established protocol [29]. Briefly, the monolayer of EC
was washed three times with PBS, then destroyed by 3
minutes incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100, 4mM NH4OH
in PBS at room temperature. Wells were repeatedly
washed with PBS to remove cell debris, and the remaining
ECM was then washed twice with assay buffer. Different
concentrations (0.1 nM to 100nM) of active rhPRSS3
diluted in assay buffer, were added and incubated for 1h at
37°C. The ECM was collected in Laemmli sample buffer,
denatured and stored at -20°C until Western blot analysis.
For total lysates (ECM plus cells), the EC monolayer was
lysed in 50mM TrisHCl pH8, 10mM EDTA, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.02% NaN3, and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Roche Applied Science) on ice.

Knockdown of trypsinogen 4 and TFPI-2 using
small interfering RNA (siRNA)
Trypsinogen 4 and TFPI-2 knockdown was achieved
using small interfering RNA. Predesigned siRNA for
trypsinogen 4 (Si00693791 and Si00693805), TFPI-2
(GS7980) and negative -non silencing- control siRNA
(1022076) were obtained from Qiagen and transfected
into EC. Briefly, the cells were detached with StemPro®
Accutase® (Life Technologies), gently mixed with the
nucleic acid (1.1×106 cells in 800 µl medium containing
10% FBS and 200 nM siRNA), and transferred into the
electroporation 4mm gap cuvette (VWR International).
Electroporation was performed with the following setting:
one pulse, pulse length 30 ms, voltage 200V using the
Gene Pulser® apparatus and capacitance (Biorad). Cells

Western blot analysis
Protein concentrations were measured using
the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. The proteins
were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, transferred to IMMOBILON PVDF

membranes (Millipore) and incubated overnight at 4°C in
blocking buffer containing 2% ECL blocking reagent (GE
Healthcare) and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. The membranes
were probed with either anti TFPI-2 (1:500, SantaCruz
Biotechnology) or anti α-tubulin (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich)
antibody for 1h at room temperature. Antibody binding
was detected with anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:10,000, Sigma
Aldrich) for 45min at room temperature. The signals were
detected with ECL Prime (GE-Healthcare). Densitometry
of protein bands was analysed with GelPro Analyzer
Software (Media Cybernetics).
