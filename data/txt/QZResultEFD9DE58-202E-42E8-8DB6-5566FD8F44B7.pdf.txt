ABSTRACT
Exportin-1 mediates nuclear export of multiple tumor suppressor and growth
regulatory proteins. Aberrant expression of exportin-1 is noted in human malignancies,
resulting in cytoplasmic mislocalization of its target proteins. We investigated the
efficacy of selinexor against liposarcoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Exportin-1
was highly expressed in liposarcoma samples and cell lines as determined by
immunohistochemistry, western blot, and immunofluorescence assay. Knockdown
of endogenous exportin-1 inhibited proliferation of liposarcoma cells. Selinexor also
significantly decreased cell proliferation as well as induced cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis of liposarcoma cells. The drug also significantly decreased tumor volumes
and weights of liposarcoma xenografts. Importantly, selinexor inhibited insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF1) activation of IGF-1R/AKT pathway through upregulation of
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5). Further, overexpression and
knockdown experiments showed that IGFBP5 acts as a tumor suppressor and its
expression was restored upon selinexor treatment of liposarcoma cells. Selinexor
decreased aurora kinase A and B levels in these cells and inhibitors of these kinases
suppressed the growth of the liposarcoma cells. Overall, our study showed that
selinexor treatment restored tumor suppressive function of IGFBP5 and inhibited
aurora kinase A and B in liposarcoma cells supporting the usefulness of selinexor as
a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this cancer.

INTRODUCTION

(4) pleomorphic; and (5) round/mixed [1–3]. Complete
surgical resection is the main regime for treatment
of localized liposarcoma, but metastatic disease is
incurable by surgery resulting in a poor overall survival
[1–5]. Radiation and chemotherapy have limited value
in treatment of metastatic liposarcoma [6, 7]. Therefore,
a compelling need exists for new therapeutic targets to
improve clinical care of these patients.

Liposarcoma is the most common type of softtissue tumor, accounting for 24% of extremity and 45%
retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas [1–3]. According to
the World Health Organisation and others, liposarcoma
is currently sub-classified into five subtypes including
(1) well-differentiated; (2) dedifferentiated; (3) myxoid;

Transport of specific proteins between the nucleus
and cytoplasm is a fundamental process for maintaining
cell proliferation and apoptosis of normal and tumor
tissues. Exportin-1 (XPO1) is a well-known nuclear
export receptor responsible for transporting more than 220
cargo proteins as well as several RNA molecules from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm [8–10]. XPO1 recognizes cargo
proteins through a hydrophobic, leucine-rich nuclear
export signal, which is dependent on the RanGTP/GDP
axis [8–10]. XPO1 is the sole nuclear exporter of many
tumor suppressive and growth-stimulatory proteins
including p21, p27, p53, p73, STAT3, BRCA1, FOXO,
CDKN1A, RB1, IkB, APC, NPM1 and Survivin [11–14].
XPO1 is up-regulated in different human malignancies
such as leukemia [15], lung cancer [16], hepatocellular
carcinoma [17], melanoma [18], as well as multiple
myeloma [19]; and its overexpression is correlated with
poor prognosis, resistance to chemotherapy and short
survival [12], [15], [19]. Leptomycin B was the first well
known natural XPO1 inhibitor that suppressed the growth
of several human cancer cell lines [20]. However, this drug
had significant toxicity and a narrow therapeutic window
in preclinical animal models, as well as in phase 1 human
clinical trial [21]. Recently, novel orally bioavailable
small molecules known as Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear
Export have been developed. These inhibitors specifically
and reversibly bind to residue Cys528 in the cargobinding groove of XPO1. Selinexor (KPT-330) is the most
advanced oral inhibitor of XPO1. Phase I/II human clinical
trials have indicated that selinexor is well-tolerated and
has a favorable outcome in patients with either relapsed
or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (NCT01607892)
and solid tumors (NCT01607905, NCT01896505) [22]
(www.clinicaltrials.gov). In this current study, therapeutic
potential of selinexor was examined against liposarcoma
both in cell culture and in a murine xenograft model.
Selinexor significantly inhibited cellular proliferation and
induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of liposarcoma
both in vitro and in vivo.

very weak or negative immunoreactivity of XPO1 was
observed in benign lipoma tissues (Figure 1A). Western
blot analysis showed XPO1 protein expression in
liposarcoma cell lines of different histological subtypes
(undifferentiated, SW872; well differentiated, T778;
dedifferentiated, LPS141, LP6; myxoid, MLS402;
poorly differentiated, LISA-2; SA4) (Figure 1B).
Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis revealed
strong nuclear membrane localization of XPO1 protein
in fixed, permeabilized LPS141, MLS402, SW872 and
SA4 cells (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1B).
In addition, XPO1 expression was examined in different
subtypes of liposarcoma, using microarray database
GSE21122 comprising 46 dedifferentiated liposarcoma,
23 pleomorphic liposarcoma, 20 myxoid liposarcoma
samples and 9 normal fat samples. We observed that
90% of liposarcoma samples showed significantly
(P < 0.01) higher expression of XPO1 compared to
normal fat (Figure 1D). These results demonstrated that
XPO1 is prominently expressed in different histological
subtypes of liposarcoma. To examine the biological role
of XPO1 in liposarcoma, the gene was first suppressed
using shRNA targeting to XPO1 resulted in 70–90%
silencing of XPO1 protein in liposarcoma cells (LPS141,
SW872, MLS402 and SA4) compared to scramble
shRNA as shown by western blot analysis (Figure 1E).
This led to significant inhibition of cellular proliferation
of these liposarcoma cells compared to scramble shRNA
(Figure 1F, Supplementary Figure S1C).

Inhibition of XPO1 decreased cellular growth of
human liposarcoma cells
Next, efficacy of selinexor to inhibit XPO1
expression of LPS141, SW872, MLS402 and SA4 cells
was examined after treating with increasing concentrations
of selinexor (0–2000 nM, 24 h). Selinexor inhibited
XPO1 protein levels in a dose-dependent fashion in all
four liposarcoma cell lines at 24 h (Figure 2A). However,
selinexor treatment did not decrease XPO1 mRNA levels
(data not shown) suggesting that the drug effected protein
levels of XPO1. Further, a panel of liposarcoma cell lines
representing different histological subtypes were treated
with selinexor also caused a dose-dependent decrease
in cell viability (IC50, ranged between 100–500 nM)
(Figure 2B) and also markedly inhibited the clonogenic
capacity of liposarcoma cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2C and 2D).

RESULTS
XPO1 expression in liposarcoma samples and cell
lines and XPO1 silencing in liposarcoma cells
To determine the expression of endogenous XPO1
protein in liposarcoma patient samples, we first performed
XPO1 staining on 20 well-differentiated liposarcoma,
13 dedifferentiated liposarcoma, 13 myxoid liposarcoma,
2 pleomorphic liposarcoma and benign lipoma tissue
sections (Figure 1A) and analyzed the staining levels
by H-score method. A total of 58% of liposarcoma
samples showed strong nuclear staining (H-score value
> 199), 29% had moderate nuclear staining (H-score
value > 99), and 13% had weak nuclear staining (H-score
value 0 – 99) (Supplementary Figure S1A). In contrast,

cells in the S and G2M phase (Figure 3A). Concomitantly,
selinexor (1000 nM, 24 h) prominently decreased protein
levels of cyclin B1, cyclin E, survivin and increased levels
of p21, p27 and p53 (Figure 3B). Flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the percentage
of apoptotic cells (PIhigh/AVhigh), and a parallel decrease in
viable liposarcoma cells (PIlow/AVlow) after culture with
selinexor (0–2000 nM, 24 h) (Figure 3C). Furthermore,
western blot analysis showed that selinexor (1000 nM,
24 h) increased cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as
well as increased BAX protein expression compared to
vehicle control (Figure 3B).

randomly divide into two groups, and systemic treatment
was begin with either selinexor (10 mg/kg dissolved in
100 μl of vehicle orally) or oral vehicle (100 µl) alone,
3 times per week for 4 weeks. Selinexor treatment resulted
in significant decreased in tumor volumes and weights
compared to the xenograft tumors in mice receiving
vehicle alone (Figure 4A and 4B). Western blot analysis
of lysates of tumor tissue showed that selinexor decreased
the protein levels of XPO1 and cyclin B1 and increased
the levels of p21 and cleaved caspase 3 in the mice
receiving selinexor compared with tumors in mice treated
with vehicle control (Figure 4C). Immunohistochemistry
of these tumors showed significantly decreased number
of Ki-67 (cell proliferation marker) and CD31 (blood
vessels) positive cells and an increase in TUNEL-positive
cells (increased apoptosis) in the selinexor treatment group
compared to vehicle control group (Figure 4D). Selinexor

versus control treated mice (Supplementary Table S2).

12 randomly selected genes through quantitative RT-PCR.
Congruently with the microarray data, mRNA expression
levels of cell cycle pathway genes (CCNB1, CCNB2,
AURKA, AURKB, CDC25, TPX2) were significantly
decreased, whereas mRNA levels of adipogenesis pathway
genes (CEBPA, LPL, PPARG2, RB1, KLF6, IGFBP5,
FBXW7, CEBPD, DDIT3) were significantly increased in
LPS141 cells treated with selinexor compared to vehicle
(Supplementary Figure S2F).

Gene expression profiling in selinexor treated
liposarcoma cells
To determine global transcriptional consequences
of XPO1 inhibition, gene expression profiling of LPS141
liposarcoma cells was performed after 12 hours treatment
with either vehicle (DMSO) or selinexor using microarray.
A total of 467 genes were down-regulated and 288 were
up-regulated (FDR < 0.05) upon selinexor treatment
of LPS141 cells as compared to vehicle treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2A). Gene set enrichment
analysis showed selinexor exposed cells had significant
negative enrichment in cell cycle and aurora kinase
pathways and positive enrichment in adipogenesis pathway
(Supplementary Figures S2B–S2E). The fidelity of the
microarray results was confirmed by further validation of

Inhibition of XPO1 induced cytotoxicity in
liposarcoma cells by inducing insulin-like growth
factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5)
Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)
is expressed in a wide range of tumors including
liposarcoma; and IGF1R signaling is crucial for tumor
formation and survival of malignant cells [23]. A recent
study showed that the combination of IGF1R and CDK4
inhibitors synergistically reduced the cell proliferation of
liposarcoma cells [24]. We found in our microarray data

that two IGF-1 binding proteins (IGFBP5 and IGFBP6)
were up-regulated in selinexor treated LPS141 cells
(Supplementary Figure S2A). Many previous reports
showed that IGFBP5 can act either as a tumor suppressor
or oncogene in a tissue-specific context but nothing is
known about the role of IGFBP5 in human liposarcoma
[25–27]. RNA-sequencing analysis confirmed downregulation of IGFBP5 mRNA in liposarcoma cell lines
compared to human adipose tissue (Supplementary
Figure S3A, manuscript in preparation). Further,
microarray data analysis (GSE21122) also showed downregulation of IGFBP5 compared to human normal fat
samples (Supplementary Figure S3B). The up-regulation
of IGFBP5 mRNA and protein upon treatment with
selinexor was further verified both at the mRNA and
protein levels in liposarcoma cell lines (Figures 5A and
Supplementary Figure S3C). Interestingly, treatment of
LPS141 and MLS402 cell lines with selinexor resulted in
attenuation of phosphorylation of both IGF-1R and AKT
after stimulation with IGF-1 (Figure 5B).
We generated stable clones of LPS141, SW872
and MLS402 cells expressing either an empty vector or
IGFBP5 expression vector (Figure 5C). Overexpression

of IGFBP5 in LPS141 and SW872 cells significantly
(P < 0.001) inhibited cell growth in liquid culture
(Figure 5D and 5E), as well as clonogenic growth in soft
agar (Supplementary Figure S3D and S3E) compared
with empty vector. Silencing of IGFBP5 resulted in
significant increase in the growth of LPS141 cells in liquid
culture (Figure 5F and 5G). Furthermore, knockdown of
IGFBP5 in LPS141 and SW872 cells partially rescued the
inhibitory effect of selinexor treatment (Figure 5H and 5I).

Role of aurora kinases in liposarcoma
Our microarray data showed that aurora kinase
pathway was one of the most significantly enriched
pathways in the down-regulated genes in liposarcoma cells
upon selinexor treatment compared to vehicle exposure
(Supplementary Figures S2A and S2C). Recently, several
aurora kinase inhibitors have entered Phase I and II
clinical trials against different types of cancers [28–30].
Analysis of our RNA-sequencing data displayed robust
expression of both aurora-A and aurora-B mRNA in
liposarcoma cell lines compared to normal human adipose
tissue (Supplementary Figures 4A and 4B, manuscript

in preparation). In silico analysis also confirmed that
aurora-A and aurora-B mRNAs were significantly
upregulated in human liposarcoma microarray data
(GSE21122) (Figure 6A). Expression of aurora-A
and aurora-B was silenced in liposarcoma cells using
siRNA which resulted in a significant decreased in cell
growth of LPS141 and MLS402 in liquid culture (Figure
6B–6D, Supplementary Figure S4C). Selective inhibitors
of aurora-A (MLN8237) and aurora-B (ZM447439)
inhibited auto-phosphorylation of aurora-A and aurora-B
and decreased growth in liquid (Supplementary Figure
S4D and S4E) as well as clonogenic growth (Figure 6E)
of LPS141 and MLS402 cells. Also, these drugs lowered
the level of cyclin B1 (Supplementary Figure S4F) and
markedly increased the protein expression of p53, p27 and
p21 in LPS141 and MLS402 cells (Figure 6F).

compounds have been developed [17, 22] and showing
anti-tumor activity against various human malignancies
in vitro and in murine human cancer xenograft models
with minimal toxicities [15–17, 34].
Present study shows prominent expression of XPO1
protein in different histological subtypes of liposarcoma
in patient samples and cell lines compared to benign
lipomas. Immunofluorescence experiment data confirmed
that XPO1 is localized at the nuclear pore in liposarcoma
cells. Also, microarray database GSE21122 indicated
significant increased XPO1 mRNA expression in different
subtypes of liposarcoma samples compared to normal fat.
These data suggest that robust expression of XPO1 may
have a potential role in the pathogenesis or progression of
liposarcoma. Silencing of XPO1 suppressed the growth of
several liposarcoma cell lines. Further, selinexor caused
growth inhibition, cell-cycle arrest with upregulation of
p21, p27, p53 and downregulation of cyclin B1, cyclin
E and survivin. The drug increased apoptosis as shown
by upregulation of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP
and BAX, as well as annexin V positive staining of
liposarcoma cells. Well-differentiated and dedifferentiated
liposarcomas have 12q13-15 amplification resulting
in MDM2 overexpression. MDM2 can inactivate p53.

DISCUSSION
Liposarcoma is one of the most common soft tissue
sarcoma causing substantial morbidity and mortality
[3, 31, 32]. Inhibition of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport by
natural and synthetic products is a therapeutic approach
[33]. Recently, Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export

We found that selinexor increased the expression p53
and its target genes (e.g., p21 and BAX) proteins in
LPS141 liposarcoma cells (MDM2 amplification)
without altering the expression of MDM2 (Figure 3B
and Supplementary Figure S5A). This observation is
consistent with a previously published study [35]. Of
note, selinexor exposure (≤ 2000 nM) did not affect p53,
MDM2, CDKN1A mRNA levels suggesting that the drug
post-transcriptionally increased the level of these proteins
(Supplementary Figure S5B). Of interest, a recent study
showed that selinexor induced cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis of liposarcoma cells irrespective of their p53
expression or mutational status [35].
Importantly, selinexor (10 mg/kg orally, three times
per week at a non-toxic dose) significantly inhibited
growth of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LPS141)
xenografts in NSG mice associated with reduced cellular
proliferation (Ki-67 staining) and an increase in apoptosis
(Tunel staining) in the tumors. Recently, a phase 1 clinical
trial of selinexor in patients with advanced solid tumors
including liposarcoma [36, 37] showed a favorable
anti-tumor effect of selinexor in 78% (14 of 18) of the

liposarcoma patients, with a well-tolerated dose of
35 mg/m2 (approximately 60 mg flat dose) [37]. Taken
together, these results strongly indicate that inhibition
of XPO1 might be a valuable treatment approach for
this disease.
Our microarray data analysis showed that IGFBP5
expression was markedly increased in liposarcoma
cells after treatment with selinexor. IGFBP5 is the
most conserved member of the IGFBPs family and is
frequently deregulated in human malignancies such
as neuroblastoma [25], osteosarcoma [27, 38], breast
[26, 39, 40] as well as head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma [41]. IGFBP5 modulates cellular functions
either in an IGF-dependent manner through IGF1R
signaling or in an IGF-independent manner [42]. Notably,
we found that selinexor increased expression of IGFBP5
both at the mRNA and protein levels in liposarcoma cells.
We provide evidence that IGFBP5 can acts as a tumor
suppressor in liposarcoma cells in an IGF-1 dependent
manner; and selinexor can markedly up-regulate the
expression of this tumor suppressor protein. In addition,
microarray data showed significant enrichment of the

aurora kinase pathway in liposarcoma cells. Overexpression
and gene amplification of aurora-A and aurora-B in
liposarcoma have been reported to correlate with tumor
grade and prognostic markers [43–46]. We showed that
selinexor can significantly decrease levels of aurora-A and
aurora-B mRNA. Also, inhibition of aurora kinases either
through siRNA or selective inhibitors of aurora-A and
aurora-B suppressed the cell growth of liposarcoma cells in
both liquid culture and soft agar associated with decreased
cyclin B1 and increased expression of tumor suppressor
proteins, p53, p27, and p21.
Taken together, our data demonstrated that in
preclinical studies, selinexor is a potent therapeutic agent
against liposarcoma. This activity is probably mediated
by a number of pathways as suggested by our studies.
Clinical trials of this novel agent in liposarcoma are
clearly warranted.

proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane (Immobilion, Millipore), blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with indicated antibodies overnight
in the cold room. Blots were washed and incubated with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr. SuperSignal West Pico and West Dura Chemiluminescent
substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA)
were used for protein detection. Antibodies against XPO1/
CRM1 (H300), C-Myc, p27 (C-19), Bax (N20), Cyclin D1
(A-12) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies
(Dallas, TX, USA). Antibodies against cyclin B1, p21,
cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3,
p-IGF1R, IGF1R, GAPDH and α-tubulin were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).
Antibody against β-actin and IGFBP5 were from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Anti-proliferative effect of selinexor against
liposarcoma cells was determined using colorimetric
assays as described [48]. Briefly, 4 × 103 liposarcoma
cells were seeded in quadruplets in 96-well plates either
in the presence or absence of selinexor at 37°C in a CO2
incubator. At the conclusion of the experiment, 20 μl of
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well
and incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 2hr and
then dissolved in 100 µl of stop solution (SDS-HCl).
Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate
reader (Infinite 200; Tecan, San Jose, CA, USA). Doseresponse curves were plotted to calculate half-maximal
inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for selinexor by GraphPad
Prism4 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego CA, USA).

RT-PCR analysis and quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR)

Colony formation assay
Liposarcoma cells (1 × 103) were seeded into 6-well
plates in triplicates in complete medium. After two days,
media were supplemented with varying concentrations
of selinexor. After 2 weeks, colonies were fixed with
5% glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal violet. For
quantitative measurement, colonies were dissolved in
200 ul of DMSO and absorbance was measured at 570 nm
using a microplate reader (Infinite 200; Tecan, San Jose,
CA, USA).

Total RNA was isolated from liposarcoma cell lines
(LPS141, SW872, MLS402 and SA4) with the RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according
to manufacturer’s protocol. 1 ug of total RNA was
used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using
one step cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA). For quantitative real-time PCR
amplification, KAPA SYBR Green was used. Real-time
PCR was performed using KAPA SYBR master mix
(KapaBiosystems, Woburn, MA, USA) on an ABI 7900
Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA)
following the supplier’s protocol. Thermal conditions
for real-time qRT-PCR were set at 950C for 10 min for
initial denaturation, followed by 40 cycles of PCR with
denaturation at 950C for 15 seconds and annealing/
extension at 600C for 1 min. Primers used for qRT-PCR
for selected genes are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

Cell cycle analysis
To determine the effect of selinexor on cell cycle,
liposarcoma cells were cultured with either diluent
control (DMSO) or various concentrations of selinexor
at indicated time points as described earlier [47]. Briefly,
cells were trypsinized, washed with ice-cold PBS and
fixed with 70% chilled ethanol. Cells were stained
with PI solution (50 µg/ml PI, Triton X-100 (1%),
20 ug/ml DNase-free RNase A in PBS) for 30 min at 37°C
in dark and analyzed by LSR-II flow cytometer (BectonDickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).

Indirect immunofluorescence assay
For immunofluorescence experiments, LPS141,
SW872, MLS402 AND SA4 cells were fixed with icecold methanol and incubated with the murine monoclonal
XPO1/CRM1 antibody (1:500 dilution) at room
temperature for 2 hr. Cells were washed and incubated
with secondary antibody [anti-murine IgG conjugated
with Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies, USA)]. 4′,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) was used to stain the nucleus of the cells.
Slides were finally washed and mounted in mounting
medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and images were
captured using Nikon Eclipse E 400 microscope (Nikon,
Fukok, Japan).

Annexin V and propidium iodide (Annexin V-PI)
apoptosis analysis
Annexin V-PI staining was performed using flow
cytometric analysis as previously described. Briefly,
1 × 106 cells were cultured with either diluents control
(DMSO) or varying concentrations of selinexor in
6 well plates for 72 h and staining was performed using
Apoptosis Detection Kit II (BD Biosciences, USA). Cells
were washed twice with 1X ice-cold phosphate-buffered

saline (PBS; Life technologies, USA), trypsinized and
centrifuged. Cells were again washed with 1X PBS,
resuspended in 1X binding buffer containing 5 ul of FITCI
conjugated Annexin V and 5 ul of PI for 20 min in dark.
The samples were analyzed using LSR-II flow cytometer
(BD, San Jose, CA, USA).

Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa
Clara, CA) was used to check integrity and quantity of RNA
samples. cDNA and cRNA was synthesized using Illumina
Total Prep RNA Amplification Kit (Illumina). Human gene
HT-12 v4 Expression beads chip kits (47,000 probe spotted
genes) from Illumina (Santa Clara, CA) were used.

Liposarcoma xenograft murine model

RNA interference

Six-week-old male NSG mice were injected with
LPS141 (2 × 106) cells suspensions mixed with matrigel
(BD Biosciences) (1:1) in 200 μl of total volume and
injected subcutaneously on the flank. Treatment was
initiated 2 weeks after cell implantation. The mice were
randomly divided into two groups (6 mice per group) to
receive either vehicle control (0.6% w/v aqueous Pluronic
F-68) or selinexor (10 mg/kg in 100 μl of the vehicle,
3 times per week). Tumor diameters were measured with a
caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated by the formula
(V = π/6 × Dl × Ds2), where V is volume, Dl is the largest
diameter, and Ds is the smallest diameter [49]. Mice were
fed with Nutri-Cal (Tomlyn) thrice a week during treatment
to provide good nutrition. All mice were sacrificed at the
end of the study. Tumors were dissected and weighed.
One-half of each tumor was fixed in 10% formaldehyde for
immunohistochemistry and the other half was immediately
kept in −800C for subsequent RNA and protein analysis. We
also analyzed peripheral blood for blood counts and serum
chemistry after the 28-days of treatment (Supplementary
Table S2). The animal studies were approved by the
National University of Singapore (NUS) Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

To obtained knockdown of XPO1 in liposarcoma
cell lines for in vitro studies, human XPO1 gene specific
shRNAs and a non-targeting shRNA were cloned into a
lentiviral vector. For stable knockdown, lentiviral particles
were generated according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Cells were infected with lentivirus particles at a MOI of
20 with 8 μg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h, and stable cells
were selected using puromycin for 1–2 weeks.
Human IGFBP5, aurora-A and aurora-B gene
specific siRNA oligos (siGENOME) including scramble
oligos were purchased from Dharmacon (Coralville,
USA). LPS141, MLS402 and SW872 cells were
transfected with 30 pmol siRNA using Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Life Technologies, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 hours of transfection,
cells were used for qRT-PCR; western blotting confirmed
knockdown. Each experiment was performed at least in
triplicate on three different occasions.

Statistical analysis
For in vitro and in vivo experiments, we evaluated the
statistical significance of the difference between two groups
using two-tailed Student t-test. Asterisks in the figures
represent significant differences between experimental
groups in comparison to controls ((*p < 0.01, **p < 0.001,
***p < 0.0001). Data points in figures represent the
means ± SD (standard deviation).

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue microarray slides were purchased from
Super Bio Chips. Tumor xenografts were fixed in 10%
formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and cut into 4 μm
thick sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed
as described [47, 49]. Briefly, endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide for
10 min and antigen retrieval was done using retrieval
buffer (pH 6). Slides were blocked with 10% goat serum.
Antibodies against XPO1, CD31, Ki-67 and Tunel
were used. Immunostaining was assessed by counting
> 500 cells from 5 random fields of each specimen under
×400 magnification in the best-stained tumor area of each
section as described previously [3, 47].
