a half-life of 5 hours (3). Conjugation to 20,000 mw polyethylene
glycol (ADI-PEG20) decreases antigenicity as well as dramatically
increases serum half-life, allowing weekly administration that
reduces plasma arginine to undetectable levels (4, 5). Various
tumor types (hepatocellular carcinomas, melanomas, mesotheliomas, renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic carcinomas) have been
shown to lack expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS;
refs. 4, 6–8), a ubiquitous enzyme involved in the two-step
synthesis of arginine from citrulline (9). Unable to synthesize their
own arginine, ASS-deficient cells depend on relatively inefficient
amino acid transporters (10). In the setting of ASS deficiency,
ADI-PEG20 depletes intracellular arginine by reducing extracellular
levels available for transmembrane uptake while unaffecting cells
with preserved ASS expression capable of endogenous arginine
biosynthesis (11). Previous in vitro studies show the growth of
prostate cancer PC3 cells is inhibited when arginine is eliminated
from cell culture medium (12), indicating ADI-PEG20 may be an
effective therapy for prostate cancers.
The antitumor effects of ADI-PEG20 elicit a G1 cell cycle arrest
with eventual apoptosis in a number of tumor cell lines (13). In
addition, ADI-PEG20 is antiangiogenic, inhibiting migration and
tube formation in HUVE cells (14) and neovascularization of
neuroblastomas in vivo (15). However, other cellular effects of
arginine starvation by ADI-PEG20 are still unknown.
Nutrient depletion triggers a process called macroautophagy
(hereafter called autophagy), an evolutionary conserved eukaryotic
process in which organelles and bulk proteins are turned over by
lysosomal activity. Autophagy serves to provide ATP and other
macromolecules as energy sources during metabolic stress (16, 17).
The most distinctive feature of autophagy is the formation of
the autophagosome, a double-membrane vesicle that fuses with
lysosomes for hydrolytic cleavage of engulfed proteins and
organelles. In mammalian cells, microtubule-associated protein
1 light chain 3 (LC3) is processed by lipid conjugation to
phosphatidylethanolamine for insertion into the autophagosome
membrane (18). Translocation and processing of an eGFP-LC3
fusion protein are often used as markers for autophagic activity.
Autophagy has recently gained much attention for its paradoxical roles in cell survival and cell death, particularly in the
pathogenesis as well as the treatment of cancer (19, 20). Regulation
of autophagy is highly complex with inputs from the cellular
environment through the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/
Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (21),
members of the Bcl2 family (22), p53 (23), and death-associated
protein kinases (24). Not surprisingly, there is an intricate
relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. Whether autophagy
enables cells to survive or enhances their death is context-driven,
depending on the type of stimuli, nutrient availability, organism

Abstract
Arginine deprivation as an anticancer therapy has historically
been met with limited success. The development of pegylated
arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) has renewed interest in
arginine deprivation for the treatment of some cancers. The
efficacy of ADI-PEG20 is directly correlated with argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) deficiency. CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer
cells do not express ASS, the rate-limiting enzyme in arginine
synthesis, and are susceptible to ADI-PEG20 in vitro. Interestingly, apoptosis by 0.3 Mg/mL ADI-PEG20 occurs 96 hours
posttreatment and is caspase independent. The effect of ADIPEG20 in vivo reveals reduced tumor activity by micropositron
emission tomography as well as reduced tumor growth as a
monotherapy and in combination with docetaxel against
CWR22Rv1 mouse xenografts. In addition, we show autophagy
is induced by single amino acid depletion by ADI-PEG20. Here,
autophagy is an early event that is detected within 1 to 4 hours
of 0.3 Mg/mL ADI-PEG20 treatment and is an initial protective
response to ADI-PEG20 in CWR22Rv1 cells. Significantly, the
inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine and Beclin1 siRNA
knockdown enhances and accelerates ADI-PEG20–induced
cell death. PC3 cells, which express reduced ASS, also undergo
autophagy and are responsive to autophagy inhibition and
ADI-PEG20 treatment. In contrast, LNCaP cells highly express
ASS and are therefore resistant to both ADI-PEG20 and
autophagic inhibition. These data point to an interrelationship among ASS deficiency, autophagy, and cell death by ADIPEG20. Finally, a tissue microarray of 88 prostate tumor
samples lacked expression of ASS, indicating ADI-PEG20 is a
potential novel therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Introduction
The initial observations that various tumor cells are susceptible
to arginine deprivation were made over 40 years ago, although
appropriate therapeutic methods have hindered further development of this approach until recently. Arginine deiminase (ADI), an
enzyme isolated from Mycoplasma (1, 2), degrades arginine into its
citrulline precursor. In its native form, it is strongly antigenic with

kinase (Thr389), phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), LC3, extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide cytotoxicity assay. RWPE-1, LNCaP, PC3, and CWR22Rv1
cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with serial dilutions
of ADI-PEG20. After 6 d, thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT;
Sigma) was added for a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. PC3 cells
were treated for 3 d in 2% FBS. Formazan crystals were solubilized
by 10% SDS. The IC50 is the drug concentration at which 50% of cell
growth is inhibited.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for sub-G1 DNA
fragmentation. CWR22Rv1 cells were treated with 0.3 Ag/mL
ADI-PEG20, 100 nmol/L paclitaxel (Sigma), or pretreated with
50 Amol/L z-VAD-fmk (MBL International). Cells were analyzed by
flow cytometry as described previously (8).
Active caspase-3 ELISA. CWR22Rv1 cells were seeded in 6-well
plates and treated with 100 nmol/L paclitaxel or 0.3 Ag/mL ADIPEG20 for 24 h. Treatment groups were compared with cells
pretreated with 50 Amol/L z-VAD-fmk for 2 h before assaying for
activated caspase-3 by ELISA (R&D Systems).
MicroPET imaging. Nude mice with CWR22Rv1 s.c. xenografts
were injected via tail vein with 120 mCi of 18F-FDG and imaged by
PET as described previously (26) before and after 5 IU ADI-PEG20
treatment of 4 or 24 h. Standard uptake values (SUV) were
computed by dividing the activity concentration in each voxel by
the injected dose and multiplying by animal weight. Absolute
uptake values of posttreatment images were normalized to
pretreatment images before analysis.
Xenograft efficacy studies. For tumorigenesis, 1  106
CWR22Rv1 cells were injected s.c. into the bilateral flanks of male
athymic BALB/c mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc). Mice received
weekly 0.5 mL i.p. injections of sterile PBS (n = 4), 10 mg/kg
docetaxel (n = 4), 5 IU (225 Ag/mL) ADI-PEG20 (n = 4), or both
10 mg/kg docetaxel and 5 IU ADI-PEG20 (1 mL total volume; n = 4).
Tumor dimensions were measured twice weekly. Tumor volumes
were calculated by V = 0.5236 (L  W 2), L = length, W = width.
Fluorescence microscopy for LC3. CWR22Rv1 and PC3 cells
overexpressing eGFP-LC3 were seeded on poly-lysine–coated
coverslips. Cells were treated with 0.3 Ag/mL ADI-PEG20 for 4 or
24 h or 2 Amol/L rapamycin for 4 h. Cells were fixed, mounted
using SlowFade with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen), and examined under a 60 lens on an Olympus BX61
motorized reflected fluorescence microscope with an AMCA filter
(excitation, 350 nm; emission, 460 nm) for DAPI and FITC filter
(excitation, 480 nm; emission, 535 nm) for eGFP-LC3 using
SlideBook4.1 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations).
For live cell imaging, CWR22Rv1 cells overexpressing eGFP-LC3
were plated on 35 mm #1 glass bottom dishes (WillCo Wells),
treated with 0.3 Ag/mL ADI-PEG20, and imaged with an IX-71
inverted microscope with a 100 1.40 NA oil objective (Olympus)
and ASI 400 air stream incubator (NEVTEK) set to 37jC. Images
were acquired using a spinning disc system.
Inhibition of autophagy. CWR22Rv1 cells were treated with
25 Amol/L chloroquine (Sigma), 0.1 Ag/mL ADI-PEG20, or both for
24, 48, 72, and 96 h. LNCaP cells were treated as above except
with 0.3 Ag/mL ADI-PEG20. Cells were analyzed by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis as described previously.
CWR22Rv1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates then transiently

development, and apoptotic status. We hypothesize prostate
cancer cells that are ASS deficient are sensitive to arginine
deprivation by ADI-PEG20 and consequently, undergo autophagy
as an initial survival response.
In this study, we show susceptibility of several prostate cancer
cell lines to ADI-PEG20 correlates with the absence of ASS
expression. Due to the lack of ASS, ADI-PEG20 induces a late
caspase-independent cell death in CWR22Rv1 in vitro. Metabolic
activity by micro positron emission tomography (microPET)
imaging of CWR22Rv1 xenografts in nude mice was reduced by
ADI-PEG20. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by ADIPEG20 alone as well as in combination with docetaxel. ADI-PEG20
also induces autophagy within hours of treatment. However,
inhibition of autophagy prematurely leads to cell death by ADIPEG20. With the success of ADI-PEG20 therapy for hepatocellular
carcinomas and melanomas and our findings that prostate cancer
specimens lack ASS expression, ADI-PEG20 can potentially be
extended to clinical trials for prostate cancer. Moreover, combination with standard chemotherapies or autophagy-targeting drugs
represents multipronged approaches to cancer therapy.

Materials and methods
Reagents. Recombinant ADI formulated with multiple linear
20,000 mw polyethylene glycol molecules (ADI-PEG20) was
generously provided by DesigneRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Specific
enzyme activity was 7.4 IU/mg. Internal calibration of enzyme IC50
was determined with each batch.
Cells and cell culture. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 [10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin, streptomycin,
glutamine]. LNCaP cells were cultured in serum-free, phenol-free
medium before 10 nmol/L 5a-Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma)
treatment for 4, 24, and 48 h. PC3 cells were transiently transfected
and CWR22Rv1 cells were stably transfected with eGFP-LC3
plasmid (JUJ) using Effectene (Qiagen).
Reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by
TRIzol (Invitrogen) homogenization and reverse transcribed using
Moloney murine leukemia virus (Invitrogen). One hundred nanograms of cDNA were PCR amplified as described previously (25).
Primers: ASS (F) 5¶-GACGCTATGTCCAGCAAAG-3¶ and (R) 5¶TTGCTTTGCGTACTCCATCAG-3¶; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; F) 5¶-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3¶ and
(R) 5¶-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3¶. Total RNA from primary
prostate tissues was reverse transcribed using SuperScriptIII
(Invitrogen). One hundred nanograms of cDNA were amplified by
iQ5 iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) and monitored by SYBRGreen
(Invitrogen) for real-time PCR. Threshold cycle values were
normalized against actin and analyzed using QGene software.
Primers were as follows: ASS (F) 5¶-TGAAATTTGCTGAGCTGGTG-3¶ and (R) 5¶-ATGTACACCTGGCCCTTGAG-3¶; Actin (F)
5¶-TCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTT-3¶ and (R) 5¶-GAGCGCGGCTACAGCTT-3¶.
Immunoblotting. Cellular lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE
and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody
followed by species-specific horseradish peroxidase secondary
antibody. Immunoreactive material was detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce Laboratories). Antibodies were as follows: actin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ASS (BD Biosciences), caspase-3
(Biosource), GAPDH (Chemicon), tubulin (Sigma), Beclin1, phos-

reagent (Dharmacon). Cells were treated with 0.3 Ag/mL
ADI-PEG20 for 24 or 48 h the following day and analyzed by FACS
analysis as described previously.
PC3 cells were treated with 0.3 Ag/mL ADI-PEG20, 5 Ag/mL
ADI-PEG20, 1 mmol/L 3-methyladenine (3-MA; Sigma), or both for
24, 48, and 72 h and analyzed by MTT as described previously.
ASS immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
archival material from 88 prostate tumors and 59 normal prostate
samples were obtained. Tumors represent a range of Gleason
grades (3+3 = 6 to 4+5 = 9). H&E-stained sections were made from

each block to define representative tumor regions, and a tumor
microarray (TMA) was constructed. TMA paraffin blocks were
sectioned at 4 Am and transferred to glass slides. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a-ASS monoclonal mouse antibody
(DesigneRx Pharmacologies) at 2.2 Ag/mL. Normal liver was
used as a positive control. Omission of primary antibody was used
as negative control. Sections were counterstained with Gill’s
hematoxylin and fixed. Slides were independently examined by a
board certified anatomic pathologist (RGE) thrice and scored by
percentage of cells stained.

Results
Sensitivity to ADI-PEG20 correlates with ASS expression.
ASS expression in three commonly cultured prostate carcinoma
cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, CWR22Rv1) was evaluated for mRNA and
protein levels. LNCaP is androgen dependent, whereas PC3 and
CWR22Rv1 are androgen independent. The normal immortalized
cell line RWPE-1 was used to evaluate ASS expression in
noncancerous prostate cells. All cell lines expressed ASS mRNA
determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) except
CWR22Rv1 (Fig. 1A). Quantitative real-time PCR of ASS mRNA in
the prostate cancer cell lines revealed that, relative to CWR22Rv1,
LNCaP and PC3 expressed ASS transcript 6.7 and 1.4 times greater,
respectively. Western blot analysis showed CWR22Rv1 did not
express ASS protein; in contrast, PC3 expressed moderate levels,
whereas LNCaP and RWPE-1 expressed high levels of ASS (Fig. 1B).
Disparity between ASS mRNA and protein levels is potentially
attributed to nonproductive, alternatively spliced transcripts or
pseudogenes.7 The relationship between androgen status and
ASS expression was further examined by treating LNCaP cells with
10 nmol/L DHT (Fig. 1C), revealing androgens do not regulate
ASS expression.
To evaluate the effect of ADI-PEG20 on prostate carcinoma, the
previously described cell lines were treated with ADI-PEG20 over
a broad dose range and assayed for cytotoxicity with MTT.
CWR22Rv1 was the most sensitive to ADI-PEG20 with an IC50 of
0.3 Ag/mL. PC3 was moderately sensitive to ADI-PEG20, whereas
LNCaP and RWPE-1 were not responsive to ADI-PEG20 (Fig. 1D).
Taken together, these data confirm that ASS protein levels inversely
correlate with sensitivity to ADI-PEG20. CWR22Rv1 was subsequently chosen as the model cell line for future experiments.
ADI-PEG20 induces caspase-independent apoptosis in
CWR22Rv1 in vitro. To study whether the reduced viability of
CWR22Rv1 upon ADI-PEG20 treatment is due to cell growth arrest,
apoptosis, or both, we subjected treated and untreated cells to
FACS analysis. The sub-G1 DNA content was used as an indicator
of apoptosis induced by ADI-PEG20. CWR22Rv1 cells were treated
with 0.3 Ag/mL ADI-PEG20 for 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Apoptosis
was not induced until 4 days posttreatment, when f30% of cells
had undergone apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Although DNA fragmentation is
considered the defining end point in apoptosis, caspase cleavage
is an early marker for classic apoptosis. Interestingly, cleavage of
caspase-3 into its activated 17 kDa fragment was undetected after
ADI-PEG20 (Fig. 2B).
Caspase-independent cell death was further investigated with
z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor. Caspase inhibition was confirmed with caspase-3 ELISA (Fig. 2C). z-VAD-fmk led to a 50%

contrast, 18F-FDG uptake was decreased after 24 hours of ADIPEG20. Tumor SUV decreased 30% after treatment (0.00086 versus
0.0006), indicating reduced metabolic activity (Fig. 3A).
ADI-PEG20 retards CWR22Rv1 tumor growth in vivo and
synergizes with taxane. To determine the long term effects of
ADI-PEG20 in vivo, nude athymic mice with s.c. CWR22Rv1
xenografts were injected i.p. with control PBS or 5 IU ADI-PEG20
weekly. Tumors from ADI-PEG20 mice were significantly smaller
than tumors from control mice (157.6 mm3 versus 1,108.99 mm3)
at 13 days after initiation of treatment when control mice were
euthanized. The effects of ADI-PEG20 were compared with the
current standard of care for hormone refractory prostate cancer
patients, docetaxel alone (27), and docetaxel in combination.
Docetaxel mice (10 mg/kg) had tumors that were smaller but
not statistically significant from control mice. However, the

reduction of activated caspase-3 levels in cells treated with
paclitaxel, a standard chemotherapy for advanced and metastatic
prostate cancer. However, ADI-PEG20 did not significantly alter
active caspase-3 levels. Although z-VAD-fmk attenuated apoptosis
in cells treated with paclitaxel by f50%, it did not affect the
fraction of apoptotic cells after ADI-PEG20 (Fig. 2D). These data
suggest that cell death mediated by ADI-PEG20 is independent of
caspase-mediated pathways.
ADI-PEG20 decreases global tumor metabolic activity. The
immediate effect of ADI-PEG20 in vivo was examined using PET.
Global tumor metabolism of glucose consumption was monitored
by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in CWR22Rv1 mouse xenografts. MicroPET scans were performed before and after ADIPEG20 treatment of 4 or 24 hours. 18F-FDG uptake in CWR22Rv1
tumors (arrows) did not change after 4 hours of treatment. In

(Fig. 4A). The LC3-II fragment appeared as early as 30 minutes of
ADI-PEG20 and persisted after 24 hours of arginine deprivation.
Increase in total autophagic flux was confirmed with chloroquine
(30), an autophagy inhibitor that disrupts lysosomal function
(Fig. 4B) and prevents completion of autophagy, resulting in an
accumulation of LC3-II. In addition, potential off-target effects of
chloroquine did not lead to caspase-3 cleavage.
Molecular pathways accompanying the induction of autophagy
were also investigated. A major nutrient-sensing pathway involves
AMPK/TSC/mTOR/S6K. During nutrient starvation, ATP level
decreases and AMP level increases, resulting in activation and
phosphorylation of AMPK. ADI-PEG20 immediately increased
phospho-AMPK levels (Fig. 4C). This should lead to inactivation
and decreased phosphorylation of mTOR kinase through the
inhibition of TSC complex by AMPK-induced phosphorylation.
Decreased phosphorylation of mTOR was evident soon after ADIPEG20 treatment (Fig. 4C). A downstream mTOR effector, S6K,
was inactivated at a later stage (>24 hours) as shown by its own
decreased phosphorylation and the decreased phosphorylation of
its substrate S6. Transient increase of S6K activity was observed at
early ADI-PEG20 time points. The exact mechanism of this
phenomenon is unclear but is likely due to feedback of this kinase
as reported by others (31). AMPK activation and mTOR downmodulation are compatible with their roles of major autophagy
regulators. We also surveyed other kinase pathways relevant to
autophagy. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was evident within 30 minutes
of ADI-PEG20 treatment, which increased in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 4C). ERK1/2 activation has been shown previously to
contribute to autophagy induced prosurvival function (32).
Autophagy delays and protects against ADI-PEG20–induced
cell death. The paradoxical relationship between autophagy and
apoptosis necessitates determination of the causal nature between
these two fundamental biological processes after arginine deprivation. Temporally, autophagy precedes apoptosis; thus, inhibition of
autophagy may modulate the onset of apoptosis.
Chemical inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine accelerated
and enhanced ADI-PEG20–induced cell death in CWR22Rv1
(Fig. 5A). By 48 hours, 27% of ADI-PEG20 + chloroquine cells were
apoptotic compared with 11% and 6% of cells undergoing
apoptosis by chloroquine alone and ADI-PEG20 alone, respectively.
Chloroquine further increased ADI-PEG20–induced cell death to
60% after 72 hours. By 96 hours, the effect of chloroquine was
abrogated, possibly due to its metabolism. Similarly, siRNA
knockdown of Beclin1, essential for autophagosome nucleation
(21), also increased the rate of cell death after ADI-PEG20
treatment (Fig. 5B). Almost 60% of cells had undergone apoptosis
if Beclin1 was knocked down before 48 hours of ADI-PEG20,
whereas ADI-PEG20 alone only led to apoptosis in 30% of cells. In
contrast, ADI-PEG20, chloroquine, and the combination of ADIPEG20 and chloroquine had no effect on apoptosis at all time
points in the ASS expressing LNCaP cells (Fig. 5C). To complete the
characterization of the relationship of ASS expression and
sensitivity to ADI-PEG20, we examined cellular response in
PC3, a cell line with low ASS levels. Higher doses of ADI-PEG20
(5 Ag/mL) were required to arrest cell growth completely compared
with CWR22Rv1, although lower doses (0.3 Ag/mL) induced
autophagy (Fig. 5D). Inhibiting autophagy with 3-MA greatly
reduced cell viability following treatment with low dose ADI-PEG20
(Fig. 5D). Therefore, ASS protein level correlates with cellular
response to ADI-PEG20, including the early induction of autophagy
before the late onset of apoptosis.

combination of ADI-PEG20 and docetaxel had a synergistic effect
on tumor growth inhibition. Tumors from ADI-PEG20 mice
reached an average of 910 mm3 at the end of the study, whereas
tumors from ADI-PEG20/docetaxel–treated mice were f75%
smaller (Fig. 3B).
ADI-PEG20 induces autophagy in prostate cancer cells.
Arginine degradation by ADI-PEG20 causes metabolic stress to
auxotrophic cells. Nutrient starvation such as complete amino acid
deprivation is a known inducer of autophagy (28). To determine
whether single amino acid deprivation is sufficient to trigger
autophagy, CWR22Rv1 cells stably expressing eGFP-LC3 were
examined under fluorescence microscopy. Under normal conditions, LC3-I is uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus and
cytoplasm. During autophagy, LC3-I is processed into LC-II and
translocates into autophagosome membranes, appearing as bright
punctae (29). LC3-II localization was seen in fixed CWR22Rv1 cells
after 4 and 24 hours of 0.3 Ag/mL ADI-PEG20 treatment.
Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, was used as a positive control
(Fig. 4A, top). Live cell imaging of CWR22Rv1 cells revealed rapid
and intense autophagosome formation after only 90 minutes of
ADI-PEG20 (Fig. 4A, bottom). Rapamycin or ADI-PEG20 significantly increased the number of cells undergoing autophagy to 15%

ASS expression in prostate cancer tissue. The above results
suggest arginine deprivation by ADI-PEG20 may offer a new
treatment strategy for prostate cancers in which ASS expression
is low. A key question that follows is whether the absence of ASS
expression is generalizable among diverse human prostate cancer
specimens. We therefore examined ASS expression by immunohistochemistry in our prostate tissue microarray. Of the 88 human
prostate tumors, none showed any detectable ASS staining. Strong
cytoplasmic ASS staining was observed, indicated by closed arrows,
in the luminal cells of benign prostate glands (Fig. 6A) and normal
prostate tissue (Fig. 6B, left). However, no ASS reactivity was
detected in prostate cancer glands (Fig. 6A, open arrows) or tissue
(Fig. 6B, right). Among 59 samples of normal prostate tissue, 27%
expressed ASS to some degree. Of the 16 samples showing ASS
expression, 2 were found to have ASS in >75% of the cells, whereas
the remaining 14 showed expression in <25% of the cells. In
addition, ASS mRNA expression was evaluated in six primary
prostate tumor tissues and two primary benign prostatic
hyperplasia tissues. ASS mRNA was almost absent in specimen

Discussion
In this report, we showed ADI-PEG20 can effectively induce cell
death in prostate cancer cells with low or absent ASS expression.
It also sensitizes cells to treatment with docetaxel, an accepted
chemotherapy in prostate cancer, or chloroquine, an inhibitor of
autophagy. These results are likely to be generally applicable to
other prostate cancer cells because virtually all prostate cancer
specimens examined in this report as well as that by Clark and
colleagues (12) expressed undetectable levels of ASS. By depletion
of arginine, ADI-PEG20 causes metabolic stress on auxotrophic
cells, complimenting conventional therapies largely based on
genotoxic stress. Although arginine deprivation therapy based on
bovine arginase has seen limited applications clinically, ADI-PEG20

There are various signaling cascades that regulate mTOR/S6K
including the PI3K (class I)/Akt pathway; inhibition of which has
been shown to induce autophagy in malignant gliomas (32, 37).
Although we did not specifically examine the activation of the PI3K
(class I)/Akt pathway, ADI-PEG20 inhibited mTOR events associated with a rapid activation of AMPK, suggesting this mechanism
in arginine deprivation-induced autophagy. Furthermore, we
observed ADI-PEG20–induced ERK1/2 activation, which has been
shown to regulate autophagy under a variety of stimuli (32, 38).
What is the biological function of ADI-PEG20 induced autophagy? Autophagy can be prosurvival or prodeath, depending on
cellular context and duration of treatment. To study whether
ADI-PEG20 induced autophagy contributes to or attenuates cell
death, we chose to block ADI-PEG20 induced autophagy with the
inhibitor chloroquine, which inhibits late stage autophagy by
alkalinizing lysosomes and disrupting the autophagolysosome (39).
Because chloroquine itself may have functions other than
inactivating lysosomes (40), we also used siRNA targeting an
essential component of autophagy, Beclin1, a component of the
class III PI3 kinase complex that nucleates autophagosomes (29).

has 1,000-fold greater affinity for arginine (33) with fewer side
effects. Our work described here thus offers a new treatment
option for prostate cancer. In addition, we uncover novel cellular
responses of arginine depletion, including autophagy and caspaseindependent cell death.
The delayed onset of apoptosis suggests the possibility of
compensation mechanisms after arginine depletion. Here, we
present evidence for the first time that single amino acid starvation
through arginine degradation by ADI-PEG20 is sufficient to trigger
autophagy in prostate cancer cells. LC3 translocation and cleavage
occur within hours of ADI-PEG20 treatment, indicating that
autophagy is an early response. AMPK senses cellular AMP/ATP
ratio, and in its phosphorylated form, signals the lack of nutrients
in the environment to the mTOR complex via TSC2 (34). Inhibition
of mTOR leads to suppression of S6K activity. Consistent with our
findings, Feun and colleagues (35) have reported the effects of
ADI-PEG20 on mTOR signaling, which include dephosphorylation
of mTOR downstream effectors S6K and 4E-BP and increased
phosphorylation of AMPK in ASS-negative melanoma cell lines.
This chain of events has been shown to promote autophagy (36).

inhibition by chloroquine enhanced the ability of alkylating agents
to suppress tumor growth (45). This underscores the importance
of autophagy to fundamental cell processes and its ability to
modulate the effect of chemotherapies across a wide variety of
cancers.
The absence of ASS as a biomarker for ADI-PEG20 efficacy has
previously been established in hepatoma and melanoma cell lines.
Phase I/II clinical trials with ADI-PEG20 led to a 47% response
rate in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas and
a 25% response rate in metastatic melanoma patients (46, 47). In
this study, we show ADI-PEG20 can be effective against prostate
cancer. ASS expression can be determined by immunohistochemistry and potentially be used as a clinical indicator for ADI-PEG20
use. The absence of ASS protein in all examined prostate tumor
samples makes ADI-PEG20 a promising therapeutic avenue to
follow. The combination of ADI-PEG20, which induces caspaseindependent apoptosis, and taxanes, which are caspase-dependent, is more effective than monotherapy. This concept of
synergistic interaction between cancer therapies is an active area
of research. In particular, combining therapies that target different
mechanisms of cell death may increase efficacy beyond either
agent alone. Furthermore, the increase of advanced imaging for
tumor assessment and staging may allow clinical monitoring of
tumor responsiveness to ADI-PEG20 by PET. Finally, arginine
deprivation by ADI-PEG20 induces autophagy as a protective
mechanism. Coadministration with an autophagic inhibitor such
as chloroquine can potentially enhance cell death in prostate
tumors. The intricate link between autophagy and apoptosis
points to autophagy as an additional target for anticancer
treatments. Thus, ADI-PEG20 is a novel prostate cancer therapy
whose mechanism of action can be complemented by other
chemotherapies to maximize cell death.

Our data show inhibition of early stage autophagy by chloroquine
or Beclin1 knockdown accelerates and enhances cell death after
ADI-PEG20, strongly suggesting ADI-PEG20–induced autophagy
triggers a protective response during early stages of treatment. At
present, we cannot rule out that prolonged ADI-PEG20 treatment
(>96 hours) may trigger autophagic cell death (programmed cell
death type II), which is usually caspase-independent. In our study,
we found chloroquine itself had little effect on the cell killing of
CWR22Rv1, unless ADI-PEG20 is present and autophagy is
induced. In addition, coadministration of chloroquine with ADIPEG20 did not activate caspase-3. This again suggests that the
major effect of chloroquine is to block autophagy, enhancing the
underlying mechanism of caspase-independent apoptosis. Consistent with this result, PC3 cells with reduced ASS levels also
underwent autophagy after ADI-PEG20 treatment. The inhibition
of autophagy with 3-MA significantly reduced cell proliferation in
the presence of ADI-PEG20. Both chloroquine and ADI-PEG20 have
no effect on LNCaP cells, which express ASS. Interestingly, ASSpositive hepatocellular carcinomas resistant to ADI-PEG20
responded to arginine deprivation by pegylated recombinant
arginase (41), providing a potential alternative to ADI-PEG20–
resistant tumors and cell lines such as LNCaP.
In cancer, an autophagy paradox has emerged in which survival
and death are context specific, particularly due to complex
interactions between autophagic and apoptotic pathways. Accordingly, cancer therapies have been reported to have opposing
effects on cell death. Photodynamic therapy promotes autophagic
cell death in apoptosis-deficient cancer cells (42), whereas
sulforaphane-induced autophagy in PC3 and LNCaP is protective
(43). Furthermore, manipulation of autophagy can sensitize tumor
cells to subsequent treatments. Induction of autophagy by an
mTOR inhibitor increased prostate cancer cell susceptibility to
irradiation (44). Conversely, chloroquine is a highly promising
autophagy inhibitor for clinical use. Although it is extensively used
to treat malaria (20), its uses against cancer are only recently
emerging. In a myc-induced lymphoma model, autophagic
