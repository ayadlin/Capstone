BACKGROUND: In limited institution phase 2 studies, thalidomide and temozolomide has yielded response rates (RRs)
up to 32% for advanced melanoma, leading to the use of this combination as ‘‘standard’’ by some. We conducted a multicenter phase 2 trial to better define the clinical efficacy of thalidomide and temozolomide and the immune modulatory
effects of thalidomide, when combined with temozolomide, in patients with metastatic melanoma. METHODS: Patients
must have had stage IV cutaneous melanoma, no active brain metastases, Zubrod PS 0-1, up to 1 prior systemic therapy
excluding thalidomide, temozolomide, or dacarbazine, adequate organ function, and given informed consent. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), RR,
toxicities, and assessment of relationships between biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Patients received thalidomide
(200 mg/d escalated to 400 mg/d for patients <70, or 100 mg/d escalated to 250 mg/d for patients 70) plus temozolomide (75 mg/m2/d  6 weeks, and then 2 weeks rest). RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled; 2 refused treatment. The 6-month PFS was 15% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6%-23%), the 1-year OS was 35% (95% CI, 24%-47%),
and the RR was 13% (95% CI, 5%-25%), all partial. One treatment-related death occurred from myocardial infarction; 3
other grade 4 events occurred, including pulmonary embolism, neutropenia, and central nervous system (CNS) ischemia. There was no significant correlation between biomarkers and PFS or OS. CONCLUSIONS: This combination
of thalidomide and temozolomide does not appear to have a clinical benefit that exceeds dacarbazine alone. We

Systemic treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma remains suboptimal. Response rates (RRs) have traditionally
been no better than 10% to 20%. This includes cytotoxic chemotherapy, whether in combination or with dacarbazine
alone, and biological agents such as interferon alfa and interleukin-2.1,2 High-dose bolus interleukin-2 systemic immunotherapy can induce durable remissions in a very small percentage of patients, but it is toxic and, thus, generally reserved for
patients with excellent performance status and organ function.2 Combinations of immunotherapy with systemic cytotoxic
chemotherapy (biochemotherapy) initially showed promise as superior to chemotherapy alone until randomized trials
revealed equivalent survival.3 Better tolerated, less toxic, and more efficacious treatments in this disease are needed.
It is estimated that up to 70% of patients who die of metastatic melanoma have either known or subclinical brain
metastases. Dacarbazine, other standard chemotherapy agents, and immunotherapeutic agents do not cross the blood-

brain barrier. Temozolomide, an agent approved for the
treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma, is an oral
alternative to dacarbazine that is orally bioavailable, has
higher cerebrospinal fluid levels (approximately 40% of
plasma concentrations), compared with dacarbazine, and
has clinical activity against melanoma equivalent to dacarbazine.4 Thalidomide is an orally bioavailable agent that
possesses sedative, antiemetic, antiangiogenic, and immunomodulatory activities and has clinical activity against
several cancers including malignant melanoma.5-8 In a
small dose-finding trial, the combination of temozolomide and thalidomide in the treatment of advanced melanoma was shown to be well tolerated and active.9 A
follow-up single institution phase 2 trial, reported by the
same investigators, using the combination of thalidomide
and temozolomide reported an overall RR of 32% with 1
durable complete remission in 38 patients.10 In a 181patient, 2-institution, randomized phase 2 trial reported
from England, the combination of temozolomide and
thalidomide produced a small yet not statistically significant improvement in response and survival duration over
temozolomide alone and a temozolomide plus interferona combination.11 Despite a lack of prospective confirmation, this oral combination regimen rapidly became a
community standard for patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma. Our intent was to expand on these
results to better define the tolerability and efficacy of a set
dose and schedule of the combination of temozolomide
with thalidomide9,10 in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma in the cooperative group setting.
The effectiveness of thalidomide historically has
been attributed to its ability to modulate tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNFa) production, though several studies
now indicate that thalidomide also costimulates differential subsets of T cells, resulting in regulation of additional cytokines involved in immune responses.12-15 In
an attempt to better understand the immune modulatory effects of thalidomide (in combination with temozolomide) in patients with metastatic malignant
melanoma, several laboratory immune correlates were
measured. CD4þ/CD25þ regulatory T cells are known
to be important modulators of immune response.16-20
Increased levels of these circulating CD4þ/CD25þ regulatory T cells have been described in patients with melanoma, reflecting a potentially immune suppressive
environment in vivo.21 With the patient’s consent,
blood samples were to be obtained at 4 time points
each: before and at 5 weeks, 9 weeks, and 13 weeks af-

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients must have had a biopsy-proven diagnosis
of unresectable stage IV melanoma of cutaneous origin,
and they must have been without active brain metastases
as documented by baseline computed tomography (CT)
scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.
Patients may have received up to 1 prior systemic therapy
for stage IV disease excluding prior thalidomide, temozolomide, or dacarbazine. Prior adjuvant alpha interferon
(IFN) was allowed. A Zubrod performance status of 0 or
1 was required and patients must have had adequate hepatic, hematologic, and renal function. Patients must
have been fully aware of the teratogenic potential of thalidomide and agree to fully comply with the FDA-mandated S.T.E.P.S. program. Women of childbearing
potential must have had a negative pregnancy test, with a
sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL, performed within 24
hours before the start of treatment with thalidomide.
Local institutional review board approval of the trial was
required at each participating institution and all patients
gave written informed consent.
Treatment
All patients were to receive both agents by oral dosing on a
daily basis using the same doses and schedule as described
by Hwu et al.9,10 Thalidomide was administered at bedtime 30-60 minutes before temozolomide. For patients
younger than 70 years of age, thalidomide was started at
200 mg/day and titrated up at 100 mg/day increments at
2-week intervals to a maximum of 400 mg/day during the
first cycle and maintained at that dose as long as therapy
was tolerated. For patients 70 years of age, the starting
dose of thalidomide was 100 mg/day and escalated in 50
mg/day increments at 2-week intervals to a maximum of
250 mg/day. Temozolomide was administered at a dose
of 75 mg/m2/day daily for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week
break with 8-week cycles repeated until progression or
unacceptable toxicity. No prophylactic anticoagulation
was required.
Dose modifications were performed using the NCI
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0. For grade 2 rash/desquamation or for grade 3
or 4 somnolence/depressed level of consciousness, sensory
neuropathy, or constipation, thalidomide was to be held

and restarted at the next lowest dose level previously tolerated by the patient (or at 50 mg or 100 mg if the initial
dose of 100 mg or 200 mg was not tolerated) when toxicity resolved to  grade 1 for at least 2 weeks. For all other
grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, temozolomide was
to be held until the toxicity resolved to  grade 1 and
restarted at a dose of 60 mg/m2/day. If the grade 3 or 4
toxicity recurred, temozolomide was again held until the
toxicity resolved to  grade 1 and restarted at a dose of 45
mg/m2/day. If grade 3 or 4 toxicity again recurred, the
patient was removed from protocol treatment. For grade
4 hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, temozolomide was withheld until the toxicity resolved to  grade 1, and then resumed at the same
dose. If grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia
recurred, temozolomide was again held until toxicity
resolved to  grade 1, and then resumed at a dose of 60
mg/m2/day. Again, if grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia recurred, temozolomide was again held until
toxicity resolved to  grade 1, and then resumed at a
dose of 45 mg/m2/day. If, again, grade 4 neutropenia or
thrombocytopenia recurred or if temozolomide was
withheld for 4 consecutive weeks because of toxicity,
then patients were removed from protocol treatment.
No dose reductions were to be performed for grade 3 or
4 anemia.
Tumor response was evaluated by physical examination, chest x-ray, CT scan, or other diagnostic tests, as
appropriate, after every 8-week cycle of therapy. Standard
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
were used for response.
Statistical Methods
The primary objective of this trial was to assess the 6month progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with
stage IV melanoma treated with the combination of oral
thalidomide and temozolomide. Secondary objectives
included assessment of objective tumor response, overall
survival (OS), qualitative and quantitative toxicities of
this combination, and a preliminary investigation of specific circulating biomarkers and the relationship of these
biomarkers with clinical outcomes. On the basis of data
from previous Southwest Oncology Group phase 2 trials
in stage IV melanoma, it was assumed that this regimen
would not be of interest if the true 6-month PFS probability was less than 10% and that a true 6-month PFS of
25% or more would be of considerable interest. The
accrual goal was 55 evaluable patients. If 10 or more of
the 55 patients survived at least 6 months with no evi-

426

dence of disease progression, then this would be considered sufficient evidence to warrant further study of this
regimen. This design had a significance level of 4% (probability of falsely declaring an agent with a 10% 6-month
PFS probability to warrant further study) and a power of
92%, (correctly declaring an agent with a 25% 6-month
PFS probability as warranting further study). Assuming
complete follow-up, 55 patients would be sufficient to
estimate the 6-month PFS probability, the 1-year OS
probability, and toxicity rates to within at least 13%
(95% confidence interval [CI]). Furthermore, with 55
patients, any toxicity occurring with at least 5% probability would likely be observed at least once (94% probability). Response was to be evaluated only among the subset
of patients with measurable disease at baseline. Assuming
80% of the 55 eligible patients would have measurable
disease, this would be sufficient to estimate the RR (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses)
to within at least  15% (95% CI).
PFS was defined as the time from study enrollment to the date of progression, symptomatic deterioration, or death. Patients last known to be alive and
progression-free were censored at the date of last contact. OS was defined as the time from study enrollment
to the date of death or last follow-up. Progression-free
and OS distributions were estimated by the KaplanMeier method.22
An exploratory analysis was performed to investigate
the relationship between clinical outcomes and immunologic biomarker values. The relationship between biomarker values and response was analyzed using logistic
regression methods or by a 2-sided Fisher exact test. Cox
proportional hazard models were fit to assess the relationship between the biomarkers and PFS and OS.23 In addition, the change in biomarker values from baseline to
Week 5, Week 9, and Week 13 were analyzed using a
paired 2-sided nonparametric sign test. Because of the
limited sample size, the objective of this analysis was limited to generating hypotheses to be further investigated in
larger cohorts, as there would only be sufficient power to
detect very strong relationships. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.
Biomarkers
Serum samples were obtained at baseline and at 5, 9, and
13 weeks after initiation of therapy. Unprocessed venipuncture tubes were shipped overnight at ambient temperature to a central processing lab where immunomonitoring protocols were carried out in standard,

(interleukin [IL-2], IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, and
IFNc) that were measured in serum using cytokine
immunoassays IFNc ELISPOT against peptides, which
comprised a pool of 32 8-12-mer peptides, representing
immunodominant CD8þ T cell epitopes from human
cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, and influenza virus
(CEF peptide pool) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) as a
polyclonal T cell activator.24,25 Flow cytometry was performed to enumerate natural killer (NK) (CD16þ/
CD56þ), CD4 (CD4þ/CD3þ), Treg (CD4þ/
CD25hi), CD8 (CD8þ/CD3þ), activated CD8 (CD8þ/
CD25þ), CD25- Treg (CD4þ/CD25-/FoxP3þ), and
FoxP3þ Treg (CD4þ/CD25hi/FoxP3 þ) cells.

RESULTS
Patients
A total of 64 patients were enrolled in this multi-institutional phase 2 trial from June 2005 to January 2007.
Two eligible patients who withdrew consent never
received any protocol treatment and, thus, are not
evaluable for any of the study endpoints. Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Two-thirds of the
patients were male. Three patients had a history of previously treated brain metastases. Over half the patients
had M1c disease. Of the 11 patients who received
prior systemic therapy, 7 had received cytotoxic chem-

otherapy and 5 patients received immunotherapy,
including 1 patient who received a combination biochemotherapy regimen.

Efficacy
All 62 patients had documented disease progression,
including 8 patients with new brain metastases. The 6month PFS estimate was 15% (95% CI, 6%-23%) and
the median PFS was 2 months (95% CI, 2-4 months)
(Fig. 1). The estimated 1-year OS was 35% (95% CI,
23%-47%) and the median OS was 8 months (95% CI,
6-12 months) (Fig. 2). For the 6 surviving patients, the
median follow-up is 21 months (range, 20-32 months).
Fifty-four patients had measurable disease at baseline and are included in the response analysis. There were
7 responses observed, all partial, for an estimated overall
RR of 13% (95% CI, 5%-25%).

Toxicity
There was 1 treatment-related death due to cardiac ischemia/infarction along with grade 4 thromboembolism in
the same patient, (Table 2). An additional 2 patients experienced grade 4 adverse events, including 1 case each of
neutropenia and central nervous system ischemia. Grade
3 fatigue was the most common significant toxicity,
occurring in 6 patients. Ninety percent of patients experienced some degree of toxicity.
Biomarker Analysis
Assay results were received representing 52 of the patients
enrolled. This included 2 patients with no assay results
from baseline specimens. Summary statistics for each of
the biomarkers at baseline and at Week 5, Week 9, and

428

Week 13 are displayed in Table 3. For this analysis, assay
values extrapolated beyond the normal range of the assay
and with questionable reproducibility were discarded.
The values for CEF and phytohemagglutinin represent
the number of spot-forming units per million minus the
background (spot-forming units for no peptide), plus 2
standard deviations.
The change in biomarker values from baseline to
Week 5, Week 9, and Week 13 were analyzed using a
paired 2-sided nonparametric sign test. Only those
patients with data at both time points were included (Table 4). Of these 42 comparisons, significant differences
were associated with the following: an increase in IL-10
from prestudy to Week 5 (median difference ¼ 3.17; P ¼
.001) and decreases in the %CD16þ/CD56þ from prestudy to Week 9 (median difference ¼ 2.85; P ¼ .03),
percentage of CD4þ/CD3þ from prestudy to Week 5
(median difference ¼ 4.4; P ¼ .01), and percentage of
CD4þ/CD25þ from prestudy to Week 13 (median difference ¼ 5; P ¼ .04).
The relation between clinical outcomes and baseline
biomarker values was then explored. Because of the highly
skewed distributions of the baseline data, the values for each
assay were dichotomized into 2 groups as follows. For the
serum cytokine assays, results were categorized as falling within
the normal range (as specified by 1 of the assay manufacturers)
versus above normal. For ELISPOT, results were categorized
as strong (>1000 spot-forming units/million) versus weak or
intermediate (1000 spot-forming units/million). The flow
cytometry results were split along the observed sample
medians. The relationship between each biomarker and
response (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial)
was analyzed using a 2-sided Fisher exact test.

DISCUSSION
When compared with a meta-analysis on systemic
therapy of advanced melanoma, this multicenter phase
2 trial of thalidomide plus temozolomide yielded
results no better than 70 negative phase 2 trials.26 On

the basis of the model presented in this meta-analysis,
the predicted 6-month PFS and 1-year survival rates
for the patients enrolled on this trial are 16% and
34%, respectively. The observed 6-month PFS of 15%
(95% CI, 6%-23%) and 1-year survival of 35% (95%
CI, 23%-47%) are virtually identical to what was predicted based on observations from 2001 stage IV melanoma patients treated on cooperative group phase 2
trials. The overall RR of 13% (5%-25%, 95% CI) for
this combination is also equivalent to what would be
expected from dacarbazine or temozolomide alone.4
On the basis of these results, use of this combination
regimen is not recommended nor is further evaluation
in a phase 3 trial appropriate.
The toxicity of thalidomide with temozolomide
was acceptable in this study, despite nearly all patients
experiencing some adverse event. No prophylactic anticoagulation was mandated, yet only 4 thromboembolic phenomena were observed, albeit 1 led to treatment-related
death from cardiac ischemia/infarction. Only 3 grade 4
events were observed. Expected toxicities of thalidomide
including constipation and fatigue were common. Myelosuppression and neuropathy were uncommon.
Immunomodulatory effects of thalidomide have
been well described.12-15,27 The effect on immunomodulation of this agent when combined with temozolomide,
an inhibitor of DNA replication, in the treatment of
advanced melanoma has not been previously reported.
We evaluated several circulating cytokines reported to be
modulated by thalidomide treatment either in vitro or in
vivo, frequency of immune suppressive regulatory T cells
and other immune cell types, and functional CD8 T cell
responses against a pool of recall antigens at various time
points throughout the course of therapy in an exploratory
attempt to correlate immune response biomarkers with
clinical outcome. CD8 þ T cell responses were evaluated
to assess the overall immune status of patients over the
course of treatment. The results of these efforts were inconclusive and reflect the difficulty in finding significant correlations that are biologically relevant given the relatively
small number of patients whose samples were evaluable.
That is, baseline biomarker samples were submitted or
results reproducible in often less than 50% of patients enrolled and in subsequent weeks of therapy, consistently less
than 30% of patients had all samples submitted for testing.
Given the large number of statistical comparisons necessary, the number of blood samples tested was far too small
to allow for any definitive conclusions. Despite this, the
most interesting of the biomarker analyses was the decrease

430

in percentage of CD4 þ CD25hi (Treg) cells over the treatment period, suggesting that the treatment regimen may
have a beneficial, though not clinically significant, effect on
decreasing immune suppressive T cells. This observation
may be related to the reported effects of thalidomide on the
preferential costimulation of CD8 þ T cells and type 1
helper T cells.12,13 Thalidomide-induced reduction of the
immune suppressive environment may improve natural
immunity against melanoma and consequently improve
the prospect of clinical responses, as is the goal of active
immunotherapy for melanoma.28
The treatment for stage IV melanoma remains
unsatisfactory, and despite the introduction of several different therapeutic agents in other areas of oncology, there
have been no new drugs approved for use in melanoma
for many years. Even approaches that appear to have definite activity against melanoma, such as temozolomide,
biochemotherapy, and anti-CTLA4 antibodies, have
failed in industry-sponsored or cooperative group phase 3
trials.3,4,29 It is increasingly apparent that efforts to identify
active agents in melanoma solely by objective RRs are inadequate. Better endpoints need to be selected, such as 6month PFS and 1-year OS. Equally important, the role of
patient selection in influencing results of metastatic melanoma trials has been under appreciated; promising results
of single-institution studies repeatedly fail to survive the
scrutiny of multi-institutional trials. Despite this, results of
single-institution trials with commercially available agents
frequently end up in widespread use in the community.
Identification of predictive markers for clinical benefit is
one avenue worth pursuit as is confirmation of limited
institution phase 2 results in larger multi-institutional studies before alterations in the standard of care are made. It is
clear that more innovative clinical trials in the treatment of
malignant melanoma are required, with enrollment of a
higher percentage of such patients because the standard of
care in this disease has such poor results.
