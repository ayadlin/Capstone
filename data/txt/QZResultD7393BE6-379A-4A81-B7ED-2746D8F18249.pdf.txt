ABSTRACT
Sensitive to apoptosis gene (SAG), also known as RBX2, ROC2, or RNF7, is a RING
component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases, which regulates cellular functions through
ubiquitylation and degradation of many protein substrates. Although our previous
studies showed that SAG is transcriptionally induced by redox, mitogen and hypoxia
via AP-1 and HIF-1, it is completely unknown whether and how SAG is ubiquitylated
and degraded. Here we report that NEDD4-1, a HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin
ligase, binds via its HECT domain directly with SAG’s C-terminal RING domain
and ubiquitylates SAG for proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistently, SAG
protein half-life is shortened or extended by NEDD4-1 overexpression or silencing,
respectively. We also found that SAG bridges NEDD4-1 via its C-terminus and CUL-5
via its N-terminus to form a NEDD4-1/SAG/CUL-5 tri-complex. Biologically, NEDD4-1
overexpression sensitizes cancer cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis by reducing
SAG levels through targeted degradation. Thus, SAG is added to a growing list of
NEDD4-1 substrates and mediates its biological function.

INTRODUCTION

first cloned in our laboratory as a redox-inducible protein
[5]. Our subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies showed
that SAG is an anti-apoptotic cellular survival protein
whose overexpression protects cells from apoptosis
induced by various stimuli [9, 10], whereas its silencing
by siRNA or deletion by gene knockout induces apoptosis
[11, 12]. SAG promotes the stage-dependent degradation
of c-Jun and IκBα, thus regulating skin carcinogenesis
induced by DMBA-TPA [9]. Our most recent results
showed that SAG is an onco-cooperating gene, required
for lung tumorigenesis induced by a mutant Kras [13].
Although our previous studies showed that SAG is
subjected to the regulation of AP-1 [14] and HIF-1 [15]
at the transcriptional level, it is unknown how SAG is
regulated at the post-translational level and by which E3
ligase.
Human NEDD4-1 is a HECT domain-containing
E3 ubiquitin ligase. The NEDD4 family consists of
nine members with NEDD4-1 (NEDD4) and NEDD42 (NEDD4L) being most closely related to each other
[2]. Despite ubiquitous expression of NEDD4-1 and

Protein ubiquitylation is carried out by a three-step
enzymatic cascade, involving an E1 ubiquitin-activating
enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an
E3 ubiquitin ligase [1]. HECT (Homologous to E6-AP
C-terminus) domain-containing E3s and RING (Really
Interesting New Gene) finger-containing E3s are the two
major classes of E3s [2]. The HECT catalytic domain
forms an E3-ubiquitin thioester intermediate prior to
directly transferring the ubiquitin to the bound substrate
[3], whereas the RING E3s use a RING finger domain
to recruit ubiquitin-loaded E2 and transfer the ubiquitin
from E2 to a lysine residue on a targeted substrate via an
isopeptide bond [4]. The multi-unit Cullin RING ligase
(CRL) is the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases with
its RING component being either RBX1 or RBX2 [5, 6].
Both family members contain an evolutionarily conserved
RING finger domain at the C-terminus, which is required
for the ubiquitin ligase activity of CRLs [7, 8].

NEDD4-2, it appears that the two proteins have distinct
functions by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitylation
[for review see ref. [16]]. Early studies showed that
NEDD4-1 promotes PTEN polyubiquitylation for targeted
degradation [17], and PTEN monoubiquitylation for
targeted nucleus localization [18]. However, the recent
mouse in vivo studies showed that Nedd4-1 knockout
neither changes the PTEN level, nor PTEN subcellular
localization [19, 20], raising the issue of whether PTEN
is a physiological substrate of NEDD4-1. Besides
controversial PTEN, other reported substrates of NEDD41 include growth factor receptors, such as IGF1R [21, 22]
and FGFR1 [23], AKT [24], the RING-finger E3, Cbl [25],
along with a few others [for review see ref. [26]].
A recent large scale proteomic study identified SAG
as a putative NEDD4-1 binding partner [27]. In this study,
we followed-up this lead and reported here that SAG

indeed binds to NEDD4-1 and is subjected to NEDD41 mediated ubiquitylation and degradation. Our study
demonstrates that SAG is a novel substrate of NEDD4-1.

RESULTS
The protein levels of SAG and NEDD4-1 are
inversely correlated and SAG binds to NEDD4-1
via its RING domain
In a recent large scale proteomic study, SAG was
identified as a binding partner of human NEDD4-1, but
not NEDD4-2 [27]. Since it is unknown how SAG is
ubiquitylated and degraded, and by which E3 ligase, we
hypothesized that NEDD4-1 may be an E3 ligase for SAG.

We first determined potential correlation in the protein
levels between SAG and NEDD4-1 in multiple human
lung cancer cell lines, and found that the level of SAG,
but not its family member RBX1, is largely correlated
in a inverse manner with NEDD4-1 (Figure 1A). We
next determined whether the two proteins would bind to
each other by an IP pull-down assay. Indeed, ectopically
expressed SAG, but to a lesser extent, ROC1, pulled down
endogenous NEDD4-1 in 293 cells (Figure 1B). We further
determined endogenous binding of two proteins and found
that SAG was detected in NEDD4-1 immunoprecipitates,
but not in the IgG control. Reciprocally, NEDD4-1 was
detected in SAG immunoprecipitates (Figure 1C&D).
Moreover, SAG-NEDD4-1 binding was significantly
enhanced when protein degradation was inhibited in the
presence of MG132 (Figure 1C&D). Thus, SAG binds to

NEDD4-1 under the physiological conditions.
The NEDD4 family contains an N-terminal
C2 domain for membrane targeting, a central region
containing WW domains for protein–protein interaction,
and a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain for ubiquitin
protein ligation [28] (Figure 2A). Substrate recruitment
by NEDD4 proteins is mediated via WW domains
that recognize the PY (LPxY or PPxY) motifs in
target proteins [29]. Although the majority of the top
substrates of NEDD4-1 harbored the expected PY motifs,
several potential substrates bound NEDD4-1 through
an unknown mechanism [27]. Given that SAG does
not contain such a PY motif, we defined the binding
domains on both proteins that mediate their binding. A
series of HA-tagged NEDD4-1 deletion mutants were
constructed (Figure 2A), along with the FLAG-tagged

SAG N-terminal (NT) fragment and the C-terminal (CT)
RING domain (Figure 2B). The two-way pull down assay
revealed that full length HA-NEDD4-1 and its deletion
mutant HA-NEDD4-1-N3 were detected in FLAG-SAG
immunoprecipitates by anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 2C),
whereas SAG was detected in immunoprecipitates of
wt and HA-NEDD4-1-N3 mutant by anti-HA antibody
(Figure S1A), indicating that NEDD4-1 interacts with
SAG via its HECT domain. Reciprocally, both wt FLAGSAG and FLAG-SAG RING domain were detected in
HA-NEDD4-1 immunoprecipitates by anti-HA antibody
(Figure 2D). Likewise, HA-NEDD4-1 was detected in
immunoprecipitates of wt FLAG-SAG and FLAG-SAG
RING domain by anti-FLAG antibody (Figure S1B).
Note that expression of the SAG N-terminal fragment
was undetectable (data not shown). Taken together, our
results indicate that SAG-NEDD4-1 binding is mediated
by the HECT domain on NEDD4-1 and the RING domain
on SAG. Interestingly, both domains are required for the
ligase activity of either protein.

1 and CUL-5 were detected in SAG immunoprecipitates
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, treatment with proteasome
inhibitor MG132 increased the SAG levels as well as the
binding among the three components (Figure 3A&B).
Taken together, our results indicated that SAG binds to
CUL-5 via its NTD [31, 32] and NEDD4-1 via its CTD
to form a NEDD4-1/SAG/CUL-5 tri-complex under
physiological conditions.

NEDD4-1 regulates SAG protein level by
promoting its poly-ubiquitylation
Having detected inversely correlated protein
levels and a physical interaction between NEDD4-1 and
SAG, we next determined whether SAG protein level is
regulated by NEDD4-1. In a co-transfection experiment
in 293 cells, when NEDD4-1 was co-transfected, the
level of ectopically expressed SAG was reduced in a dose
dependent manner (Figure 4A&B). We further transfected
NEDD4-1 into H358 lung cancer cells, which show a low
level of NEDD4-1 and a high level of SAG (Figure 1A),
and found a dose dependent reduction of endogenous
SAG (Figure 4C). Furthermore, ectopic expression of HANEDD4-1 had no effect on SAG mRNA level (Figure 4D).
Consistently, we performed a siRNA-based knockdown
experiment in SK-MES-1 lung cancer cells, where
NEDD4-1 levels are high, but SAG levels are moderate,
and found that the endogenous SAG level increased
when NEDD4-1 was knocked down by two independent
siRNAs in a manner dependent on the level of NEDD41 knockdown (Figure 4E). Again, NEDD4-1 knockdown
didn’t change the level of SAG mRNA (Figure 4F).

NEDD4-1/SAG/CUL-5 forms a tri-complex
It has been previously shown that a) under
physiological conditions, SAG preferentially binds
with CUL-5 [30], and b) SAG, through its N-terminal
domain (NTD) binds to the C-terminal domain (CTD)
of CUL-5 [31, 32]. We, therefore, tested our hypothesis
that NEDD4-1/SAG/CUL-5 might form a tri-complex
under physiological conditions by a pull-down assay.
Indeed, both SAG and CUL-5 were detected in NEDD4-1
immunoprecipitates (Figure 3A). Likewise, both NEDD4-

followed by Western blotting with indicated antibodies.

These data collectively indicate that NEDD4-1 negatively
regulates the SAG protein levels.
To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying
NEDD4-1-mediated negative regulation of SAG protein
level, we first determined whether SAG is subjected to
poly-ubiquitylation by ectopically expressed NEDD41. A cell-based ubiquitylation assay was performed
where ubiquitylated proteins were captured with nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography
from 293 cells transfected with pCDNA3.1 vector, FLAGSAG, His-ubiquitin and HA-NEDD4-1, followed by
detection of SAG ubiquitylation by anti-FLAG antibody
(for exogenous SAG) (Figure 5A) or anti-SAG antibody
(for both exogenous and endogenous SAG) (Figure 5B).

In both cases, NEDD4-1 promoted substantial polyubiquitylation of SAG (Figure 5A&B), indicating that
NEDD4-1 promotes the ubiquitylation of both exogenous
and endogenous SAG.
We further determined SAG poly-ubiquitylation,
using an in vitro purified system containing E1, E2, and E3
(HA-NEDD4-1), and found that HA-NEDD4-1 induced
SAG ubiquitylation in a manner dependent on both E1
and E2 (Figure 5C; lane 3). NEDD4-1-mediated polyubiqutination of SAG also leads to a significant reduction
of SAG protein, as measured by a direct Western blotting
analysis (Figure 5C; lane 3). Taken together, our data
indicate that NEDD4-1 mediates SAG poly-ubiquitylation
and subsequent degradation.

SAG protein half-life is shortened by NEDD41 overexpression and extended by NEDD4-1
knockdown

protein half-life shortened from longer than 24 hrs to ~8
hrs, after HA-NEDD4-1 transfection into SAG high but
NEDD4-1 low expressing H358 cells (Figure 6C&D,
lanes 7-12). Consistently, siRNA knockdown of NEDD4-1
caused the accumulation of SAG basal level and extended
the protein half-life of endogenous SAG from 8 hrs to
more than 24 hrs in SK-MES-1 cells, which express a
high level of NEDD4-1 (Figure 6E&F, lanes 7-12). Taken
together, our results support the notion that SAG is a new
substrate of NEDD4-1 E3 ligase, which ubiquitylates it for
targeted degradation.

We continued to determine whether NEDD41 shortened SAG protein half-life. In a cotransfection
experiment, HA-NEDD4-1 overexpression decreased the
basal level of exogenous SAG and markedly shortened
its protein half-life from more than 24 hrs to ~ 8 hrs
(Figure 6A&B, lanes 7-12). Likewise, the basal level of
endogenous SAG was also reduced significantly with its

Overexpression of HA-NEDD4-1 sensitizes lung
cancer cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis

Another novel observation made in this study
is that SAG binds to CUL-5 probably via its NTD [31,
32] and NEDD4-1 via its CTD, thus bridging NEDD41 and CUL-5 to form a NEDD4-1/SAG/CUL-5 tricomplex. It was reported that the C-terminal RING
domain of RBX1/ROC1 mediates the binding of RBX1/
ROC1 with ubiquitin-loaded E2 conjugation enzyme [8].
Although not determined, it is very likely that is the case
for SAG, since RBX1 and SAG two family members
shared the same ligase activity, as assayed by the in vitro
ubiquitylation assay [12, 36]. Thus, NEDD4-1 binding
of SAG not only promotes SAG ubiquitylation and
degradation, but also prevents its binding with ubiquitinloaded E2, leading to abrogation of SAG ligase activity.
It was also reported that SAG family member RBX1/
ROC1 has capacity to undergo self-ubiquitylation and
degradation, whereas its association with cullins stabilize
it by preventing degradation [37]. Again, although not
determined, it is most likely that SAG would also undergo
auto-ubiquitylation, which would be prevented when it

SAG has been shown to promote cell proliferation
and protect cancer cells from apoptosis induced by various
stimuli [for review see ref. [33]]. We therefore determined
whether NEDD4-1-mediated SAG degradation would
inhibit cancer cell growth and promote apoptosis. To this
end, we established H358 stable cell line overexpressing
HA-NEDD4-1 with corresponding reduction of SAG
(Figure 7A). ATPlite-based proliferation assay showed
that ectopic NEDD4-1 expression significantly sensitized
H358 cells to etoposide-induced growth suppression in
all three concentrations tested (Figure 7B). The nature
of growth suppression was found to be mediated by
apoptosis, as evidenced by increased levels of cleaved
PARP and caspase-3 (Figure 7C). Taken together, these
results indicated that by reducing endogenous SAG level,
NEDD4-1 overexpression sensitized lung cancer cells
to etoposide-induced growth suppression by enhancing
apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
Our previous studies have shown that SAG is
positively regulated by transcription factors AP-1 [14]
and HIF-1 [15] at the transcriptional levels. Herein,
we demonstrated that SAG is negatively regulated by
NEDD4-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase at the post-translational
level. The following lines of evidence support the notion
that SAG is a novel substrate of NEDD4-1. First, SAG
and NEDD4-1 bind together under the physiological
conditions via the RING and HECT domains, respectively.
This is an atypical and a non-canonical manner, since
NEDD4-1 contains several WW domains, which are the
protein interaction modules for the binding of NEDD41 to its target proteins containing the PY (LPxY or
PPxY) motifs [29]. SAG neither contains PY motif, nor
binds to the WW domains of NEDD4-1. Nevertheless,
the HECT domain of NEDD4-1 has also been shown to
interact with the N-terminal region of PTEN and mediate
its ubiquitylation [34]. A similar substrate recognition
mechanism is employed by Rsp5, the only ortholog of
NEDD4-1 in yeast [35]. Second, the protein levels of SAG
in multiple human lung cancer cell lines are inversely
correlated with the levels of NEDD4-1. NEDD4-1
overexpression reduces SAG levels in a dose dependent
manner, whereas NEDD4-1 knockdown via siRNA causes
SAG accumulation, also in a dose dependent manner.
Third, NEDD4-1 promotes SAG poly-ubiquitylation and
degradation, as demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo
ubiquitylation assays. Finally, the SAG protein half-life is
shortened by NEDD4-1 overexpression, but extended by
its knockdown. Thus, SAG is added to a growing list of
NEDD4-1 substrates.

forms a complex with cullins, particularly CUL-5. Given
the fact that NEDD4-1 promotes SAG ubiquitylation and
degradation even when SAG forms a stable complex with
CUL-5 (Figures 3&5), we conclude that SAG degradation
via NEDD4-1-mediated ubiquitylation, not by selfubiquitylation, contributes to chemosensitization (Figure
7).
As a redox-inducible antioxidant protein, SAG
protects cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli
[5], in a RING domain dependent manner. Importantly,
recent studies have begun to reveal that SAG might
function as an oncoprotein that is frequently overexpressed
in human carcinomas of lung, colon, stomach and liver (for
review see ref. [33]) and required for lung tumorigenesis,
triggered by a mutant Kras [13]. Consistent with our
previous observation that SAG silencing sensitized cancer
cells to etoposide-induced cell killing [38], NEDD4-1
overexpression, which reduces SAG level, also sensitized
lung cancer cells to etoposide-induced growth suppression
via apoptosis induction (Figure 7). Hence, inactivation of
SAG either by siRNA silencing of itself [11, 38], or by
overexpression of its upstream E3 ligase, NEDD4-1 (this
study), or by its small molecule inhibitor, MLN4924 [39],
all induces apoptosis, further supporting the notion that
SAG E3 ligase is an attractive anti-cancer target.

lysates were incubated with FLAG beads (Sigma) or with
HA antibody (Roche) for 3 hrs followed by incubation
with protein A&G beads (Santa Cruz) at 4°C overnight
with rotation. The beads were washed three times with
lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitation complexes were
subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to

The in vivo ubiquitylation
The 293 cells were cotransfected with FLAGSAG, HA-NEDD4-1 and His-HA-ubiquitin, along with
pCDNA3.1 vector control. In vivo ubiquitylation assays
were performed as previously described using Ni-beads
pull-down [14].

The in vitro ubiquitylation
HA-NEDD4-1 was precipitated from HA-NEDD4-1
transfected 293 cells and eluted with 3xHA peptide
(Sigma), serving as the source of E3. FLAG-tagged SAG
was pulled down by FLAG bead (Sigma) after transfection
into 293 cells, serving as substrate. The reaction was
carried out at 30 °C for 1 hr in 30 µL reaction buffer
(40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2) in
the presence of SAG (bound to FLAG beads), ubiquitin
(Boston Biochem), E1 (Boston Biochem), recombinant
UbcH5c/E2 (Boston Biochem), ATP, and HA-purified
NEDD4-1 E3. After the reaction, the beads were washed
three times with cell lysis buffer to remove non-SAGconjugated ubiquitin. The washed beads were then
resuspended in 25 μL 2xSDS-PAGE sample buffer for
SDS-PAGE and detected by IB with antibodies against
FLAG-tag or SAG.

METHODS
Plasmids, siRNA, and transfection
HA-NEDD4-1 plasmid was obtained from Dr.
Xuejun Jiang, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
[17]. FLAG-SAG plasmid was previously constructed in
our lab [5]. The NEDD4-1 deletion mutants (N2: 1–606;
N3: 605–1000; N4: 1–207) and SAG deletion mutants
(NT: 1-49; CT: 50-113) were subcloned into HA-tagged
or FLAG-tagged pCDNA3.1 plasmids, respectively.
The sequences of two siRNAs targeting NEDD4-1 were
selected based upon published literature: NEDD4-1
RNAi-A, UAGAGCCUGGCUGGGUUGUUU [40], and
NEDD4-1 RNAi-B, UUCCAUGAAUCUAGAAGAACA
[41]. The sequence for scrambled control siRNA is
AUUGUAUGCGAUCGCAGACUU.
Transfection
of the plasmids and siRNAs were carried out using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

ATPlite cell proliferation assay
Stable H358 cells expressing HA-NEDD4-1 were
established by transfection with HA-NEDD4-1, followed
by G418 selection for 2 weeks. The stable clones were
pooled and seeded into 96-well plates with 2,000 cells per
well in triplicate, along with the Vector control cells. Next
day, cells were treated with DMSO control or etoposide
(2.5, 5, 10 µM) for 48 hrs, and then subjected to ATPlite
cell proliferation assay (Perkin-Elmer).

Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
To immunoprecipitate endogenous proteins, whole
cell extracts were pre-cleared with normal IgG-AC (Santa
Cruz) followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with
antibody against NEDD4-1 (Santa Cruz; #sc-25508) and
SAG [11]. To immunoprecipitate exogenously expressed
FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged proteins, the pre-cleared cell
