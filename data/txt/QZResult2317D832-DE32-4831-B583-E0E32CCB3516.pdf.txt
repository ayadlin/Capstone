Abstract
A high percentage of patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanomas respond to the selective RAF inhibitor
vemurafenib (RG7204, PLX4032) but resistance eventually emerges. To better understand the mechanisms of
resistance, we used chronic selection to establish BRAFV600E melanoma clones with acquired resistance to
vemurafenib. These clones retained the V600E mutation and no second-site mutations were identiﬁed in the
BRAF coding sequence. Further characterization showed that vemurafenib was not able to inhibit extracellular
signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, suggesting pathway reactivation. Importantly, resistance also correlated
with increased levels of RAS-GTP, and sequencing of RAS genes revealed a rare activating mutation in KRAS,
resulting in a K117N change in the KRAS protein. Elevated levels of CRAF and phosphorylated AKT were also
observed. In addition, combination treatment with vemurafenib and either a MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor or
an AKT inhibitor synergistically inhibited proliferation of resistant cells. These ﬁndings suggest that resistance to
BRAFV600E inhibition could occur through several mechanisms, including elevated RAS-GTP levels and increased
levels of AKT phosphorylation. Together, our data implicate reactivation of the RAS/RAF pathway by upstream
signaling activation as a key mechanism of acquired resistance to vemurafenib, in support of clinical studies in
which combination therapy with other targeted agents are being strategized to combat resistance. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The BRAF oncogene is mutated in approximately 8% of all
human tumors; however, the prevalence is much higher in
melanoma, where a mutation is documented in more than 50%
of all melanoma (1). Other tumor types with a substantial
incidence of mutated BRAF include papillary thyroid (30%–
70%), ovarian (15%–30%), and colorectal cancers (5%–20%;
ref. 1). In more than 90% of cases, a single substitution of
glutamic acid for valine in the BRAF kinase domain (V600E) is
present and leads to RAS-independent constitutive activation
of BRAF and downstream signal transduction in the mitogen—
activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (1–3). In melanoma
cells BRAFV600E causes deregulated proliferation by overcom-

ing the G1 restriction point and causing cyclin D1 production in
mid-G1 (4). Notably, acquisition of the BRAFV600E mutation
seems to be an early event in melanoma development with a
high percentage of premalignant melanocytic nevi also found
to harbor the mutation (5).
Vemurafenib (RG7204, PLX4032) is an orally available, smallmolecule inhibitor designed to speciﬁcally inhibit signaling
from the BRAF oncogene (6). In in vivo and in vitro melanoma
models, vemurafenib inhibits phosphorylation of MAP/ERK
kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal—regulated kinase
(ERK), leading to G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
(7–12). Phase I clinical studies have shown that vemurafenib
treatment caused signiﬁcant tumor regressions in a majority of
metastatic melanoma patients with mutated BRAF (13).
Importantly, tumor regressions were highly dependent on
pathway blockade, with a high threshold required (6). For
example, 60% inhibition was insufﬁcient for tumor regression,
whereas 90% inhibition often correlated with robust regression. Therefore, near the threshold relatively modest differences in pathway blockade can have large consequences on
tumor response. Accordingly, tumor regrowth was frequently
observed following initial tumor regression, presumably due
to acquired resistance to vemurafenib. In the present study, we
elucidate potential mechanisms underlying acquired resistance. Melanoma cell lines with acquired resistance to vemurafenib were established to model disease relapse associated
with clinical resistance to vemurafenib in patients with

melanoma. This model system was used in vitro and in vivo to
understand molecular mechanisms of disease progression
after initial response to vemurafenib (acquired resistance
mechanisms) and subsequently to help identify potential
combination therapies to prevent or mitigate disease relapse.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, reagents, and transfection
A375 parental cell line was purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and authenticated by exome
sequencing (August 2010). All cell lines were maintained in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% of
heat-inactivated FBS (HI-FBS; GIBCO/BRL) and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine (GIBCO/BRL).
Melanoma cell lines with acquired resistance to vemurafenib were generated by propagating parental A375 cells in
increasing concentrations of vemurafenib (Hoffmann-La
Roche, Inc.) to achieve chronic selection. Six cell lines with
increased IC50 values measured by MTT assay were isolated for
further characterization. These cells were further propagated
in growth medium containing 2.5 mmol/L vemurafenib.
Vemurafenib and RO5068760 were synthesized in house.
MK-2206 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals.
A375 cell transfections were carried out 24 hours after
seeding cells on 100-mm plates (30%–40% conﬂuent). The
CRAF expression plasmid (OriGene Technologies, Inc.;
RC201983) and KRAS wild-type plasmid (Biomyx Technology;
p1025) were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics
Corporation) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Scrambled siRNA (ctrl siRNA), CRAF siRNA, and KRAS siRNA
(Dharmacon Inc.; ON-TARGET plus Nontargeting Pool
D-001810-10-05, ON-TARGET plus SMART pool L-003601-000005, NM_002880, and ON-TARGET plus SMART pool
L-005069-00-0005, NM_004985, respectively) were transfected
with DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Cellular proliferation and in vitro combination assays
Cellular proliferation assays were conducted as described
previously (11).
In vitro study of the combination of vemurafenib and the
MEK inhibitor RO5068760 or the AKT inhibitor was conducted
using the procedure outlined earlier, using drug concentrations based on the IC50 value of each drug as a single agent to
yield optimal growth inhibition ranging from approximately
10% to 90%. The combined drug treatment maintained constant ratios of the 2 agents which were added simultaneously.
Synergism, additive activity, or antagonism was determined by
median effect analysis using the combination index (CI) calculated by the CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).
For transfected cells, 500 transfected cells (100 mL volume)
were seeded in 96-well black-bottom plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Six or 16 hours after seeding of siRNA or
expression plasmid transfection, respectively, cells were treated with vemurafenib for 4 or 3 days, respectively, and cellular
viability was measured by the CellTiter-Glo Assay (Promega
Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Tumor xenografts and treatment
For the A375 xenografts (parental and vemurafenib-resistant cell lines), 10  106 cells were implanted subcutaneously
on the right lateral ﬂank of female SCID-beige mice and
treatment was initiated after approximately 7 days. The vemurafenib microprecipitated bulk powder formulation used in
clinical trials was described previously (11). Vehicle, vemurafenib, and RO5068760 were dosed orally once daily for 2
weeks.
Efﬁcacy and safety endpoints
As described previously in Yang and colleagues (11).
Western blot analysis and RAS activity assay
The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204;
#9101), anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221; #9121), antiMEK1/2 (#9122), anti-cyclin D (#2926), anti-p-AKT (Ser473;
#9171), and anticleaved PARP (#9541). Anti-ERK1/2 antibody
(06-182) was purchased from Millipore. Anti-b-actin antibody
(A5316) and anti-KRAS were purchased from Sigma. AntiCRAF (BD610152) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Western blot analysis was conducted as described previously (11).
RAS-GTP pull down was carried out according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Cytoskeleton Inc.).
Whole exome sequencing
Sequence capture was conducted with Nimblegen SeqCap
EZ Human Exome Library SR (V1.2) at Roche Nimblegen
according to the manufacturer's protocol. This assay enriches
for approximately 35 Mb of coding sequence as annotated
in the CCDS and MiRBase databases. SeqCap DNA from each of
the 6 resistant and the one parental line was sequenced using
the Illumina GAIIx. Each sample was sequenced with 2 lanes of
single-end (SE) 75 bp and one lane of paired-end (PE) 2  75 bp
sequence, by sequencing kits V.4 and generating approximately
10 Gbp of sequence per sample (range: 8.7–10.8 Gbp). Two
lanes of 75 bp SE sequence were also generated in parallel for
HapMap sample NA12752 to estimate accuracy of genotype
calls. Sequence analysis was conducted with Illumina software
(RTA base calling, Eland alignment, and CASAVA variant
calling), using default parameters; with the exception that for
CASAVA the SNP Max Ratio was set to 10 to allow for
substantial aneuploidy in the cell lines. To generate a priority
list of variants, we required each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to be present in both SE and PE sequences, to be
absent in the parental line but present in 2 or more resistant
lines, and to be predicted to be damaging using SIFT annotation or nonsense mutations (for detailed method, please see
Supplementary Material).

At the end of 3 months selection, 6 individual cell lines were
isolated from the pool of resistant cells and characterized. As
expected, each of these cell lines was highly resistant to the
growth inhibitory effects of vemurafenib with IC50 values
increased by 90- to 120-fold compared with the IC50 values
observed in the sensitive parental cells (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1). The vemurafenib-resistant cell lines are
relatively cross-resistant to the 2 MEK inhibitors tested but not
to other targeted agents tested including an AKT inhibitor, a
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, and a dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor (Supplementary Table S1). This acquired
resistance model system was then used to investigate molecular mechanisms of disease progression after initial response
to vemurafenib.
To further characterize the 6 resistant clones, signaling
through the RAS/RAF and RAS/PI3K pathways was evaluated.
In sharp contrast to the potent inhibition noted in the parental
A375 cells at low concentrations of vemurafenib, phospho-ERK
(p-ERK) levels in resistant cells were only modestly affected by
high concentrations of vemurafenib (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1). This observation recapitulates clinical ﬁndings,
namely that p-ERK was reduced in tumor samples biopsied
within 2 weeks of vemurafenib treatment; however, p-ERK was
commonly reactivated at disease relapse (6). Therefore, it
appears that the derived acquired resistant cell lines represent
a relevant model system for exploring mechanisms of acquired
resistance in patients.
CRAF protein levels and phospho-AKT (p-AKT) levels were
increased in the vemurafenib-resistant cells compared with
vemurafenib-sensitive cells (Fig. 1B). Thus reduced sensitivity
to inhibition of the RAF/MEK pathway may be, in part,
mediated by increased levels of CRAF protein, consistent with
a previous study using a different RAF inhibitor (14). This acute
increase in CRAF protein levels observed in the presence of
vemurafenib could result from allosteric stabilization of the
CRAF dimer (15, 16, 17). In addition, increased p-AKT levels
suggest that alternative pathways may be simultaneously
activated in the resistant setting. Importantly, V600E mutation
was preserved in all resistant cell lines, and sequencing of the
entire BRAF coding sequence revealed no additional mutations. Therefore, gatekeeper mutations do not account for ERK
reactivation in this model system. In addition, Western blot
analysis and quantitative PCR revealed an upregulation of
BRAF mRNA and protein levels in the acquired resistant cells
(Fig. 1C and Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Whether the
increased mutated BRAF protein plays a role in conferring
acquired resistance is being investigated. The absence of an
increase in the levels of P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance
(MDR) transporter (Supplementary Fig. S4) also indicates that
upregulation of MDR activity does not contribute to resistance.
CRAF helps mediate acquired vemurafenib resistance in
A375 melanoma cells
To further explore the role of elevated CRAF expression
levels in resistance to vemurafenib, CRAF was depleted in the
sensitive parental cells and in the 2 resistant cell lines using a
CRAF-directed siRNA construct. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of the siRNA construct downregulated CRAF protein

levels in both sensitive and resistant cells. Ablation of CRAF
protein did not change the antiproliferative effect of vemurafenib on parental A375 cells but did increase the sensitivity of
resistant cells to vemurafenib, by 7-fold (IC50 value shifted from
5.1 to 0.76 mmol/L) and 5-fold (IC50 value shifted from 8.7 to 1.3
mmol/L) for clones R1 and R6, respectively, as assessed by
reductions in the IC50 values (Fig. 2B). Conversely, overexpression of CRAF protein with a transfected plasmid in the sensitive
parental A375 cells (Fig. 2C) resulted in a more than 18-fold
(IC50 value shifted from 0.03 to 0.55 mmol/L) increase in
resistance to vemurafenib (Fig. 2D). This suggests that the
upregulation of CRAF found in the resistant cell lines participates in the acquisition of resistance.

A

RAS-GTP levels are elevated and an activating KRAS
mutation is acquired in vemurafenib-resistant cell lines
To further understand the role of increased RAS/RAF/MEK/
ERK pathway activity in resistance, we also interrogated the
pathway upstream of CRAF, directly measuring activated RAS
using an assay that exploits the known speciﬁcity of the
interaction between RAS-GTP and the RAS-binding domain
of RAF (18). Because RAS binds to RAF in a GTP-dependent
manner, determining the amount of RAS bound to RAF is a
direct measure of RAS-GTP levels. As shown in Fig. 3A, intrinsic
RAS-GTP levels in the resistant cell lines were substantially
elevated compared with levels in the sensitive parental A375
cells.

Acquired Resistant Mechanisms for Vemurafenib

One possible mechanism of increased RAS activity is acquisition or selection of activating mutations in RAS. We, therefore, conducted whole exome sequencing on the parental and

resistant lines, with particular interest in the sequencing result
of the NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS. We used NimbleGen sequence

genomic regions and sequenced these to greater than 130-fold
of median coverage on the Illumina GAII sequencer (detailed
exome sequencing methods and additional results are included in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We identiﬁed a
mutation in the KRAS gene resulting in a K117N substitution
in KRAS protein (Fig. 3B). This uncommon mutation has
been known for quite sometime to cause modest KRAS
activation in biologic studies (19–22). To further evaluate the
role of KRAS in the resistance to vemurafenib, genetic ablation
of KRAS was conducted. Downregulation of KRAS protein was
achieved using a KRAS-directed siRNA construct (Fig. 3C).
KRAS downregulation had no effect on the vemurafenib
sensitivity of the parental A375 cells assessed by inhibition of
p-ERK and cellular proliferation, but caused increased sensitivity of the resistant cells to vemurafenib-mediated p-ERK
inhibition (Fig. 3C) and decreased IC50 value for cellular
proliferation in resistant cells (from 16 mmol/L down to 0.26
mmol/L; Fig. 3D). Conversely, overexpression of the KRASK117N
protein with a transfected plasmid in the sensitive parental
A375 cells resulted in a 5-fold increase in resistance to vemurafenib (IC50 value shifted from 0.019 to 0.1 mmol/L; Fig. 3E).
When the KRASK117N protein was overexpressed in another
melanoma cell line, A2058, proliferation IC50 value was shifted
from 0.32 to 2.2 mmol/L, corresponding to an approximately
7-fold increased resistance to vemurafenib (Fig. 3F). The
potential of KRASK117N to elevate RAS activity was also
assessed by comparison to a hotspot mutant RAS, KRASG12V
in the activated RAS pull down assay. Both K117N and G12V
mutations result in high levels of RAS-GTP than wild-type and
vector-transfected controls. The hotspot G12V mutant shows
slightly higher levels of RAS-GTP than the K117N mutant
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, these data show that
the mutated KRASK117N found in the resistant cell lines does
play a role in the acquisition of resistance.
Identiﬁcation of the KRASK117N mutation in the resistant cell
lines was surprising for 2 reasons: KRAS mutations are rarely
found in melanomas and nucleotide-binding mutations are
exceedingly rare in all cancers. A plausible explanation may
derive from the recently discovered pharmacodynamic analysis in vemurafenib-treated patients: tumor responses are
exceptionally sensitive to small changes in pathway inhibition
(6). Therefore, the mutation reported here could have the
property of elevating pathway signaling just enough to overcome compound inhibition, perhaps reﬂecting the dynamics
observed in relapsing patients. We, therefore, reasoned that
additional pathway interference could restore sensitivity to
vemurafenib.
Coadministration of vemurafenib with a MEK inhibitor
shows synergistic effects in the vemurafenib-resistant
cells and xenograft models
The retention of the V600E mutation in resistant cell lines
suggests that continued suppression by vemurafenib may be
required to control cell proliferation; however, reactivation of
the RAS/RAF signaling pathway may warrant combination
with another agent that further inhibits ERK signaling to
optimally resuppress the pathway and consequently overcome
resistance. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of

974

Cancer Res; 72(4) February 15, 2012

combining vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor, RO5068760
(23), in vemurafenib-resistant A375R6 cells. As shown in Fig.
4A, single-agent treatment with either vemurafenib or
RO5068760 did not effectively inhibit ERK phosphorylation,
as expected, as the resistant cells were also cross-resistant to
MEK inhibitors (Supplementary Table S1). RO5068760 did
cause partial inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, and the
observation that this partial inhibition translated to minimal
tumor growth delay supports the hypothesis that substantial
pathway inhibition is required for efﬁcacy. However, in
combination, dual BRAF and MEK inhibition completely
abrogated the constitutive upregulation of ERK phosphorylation, inhibited cell-cycle progression as assessed by cyclin
D1 levels, and induced apoptosis evidenced by increased
levels of BimEL and cleaved PARP in the resistant cells (Fig.
4A). Consistent with these ﬁndings, the combination of
vemurafenib and RO5068760 resulted in more effective
inhibition of cellular proliferation than either agent alone.
The calculated CI values were less than 0.9 (range: 0.50–0.72)
indicating synergy between the 2 drugs in blocking proliferation of the resistant cell lines R1 and R6. In addition, RAF/
MEK inhibition shows greater synergy in the resistant cells
than in the parental sensitive cells with CI values ranging
from 0.79 to 0.96 (Fig. 4B). This synergism correlated to a
synergistic effect in induction of apoptosis with combined
RAF/MEK inhibition in resistant cells as compared with
sensitive cells. Together, these data suggest that in the
setting of vemurafenib resistance, addition of MEK inhibition to supplement ongoing inhibition of mutated BRAF is
needed to resuppress ERK signaling sufﬁciently to inhibit
tumor cell proliferation.
This in vitro synergy was conﬁrmed in vivo, using xenograft studies. Of the various resistant clones, the A375R1 cell
line showed growth kinetics that most closely matched the
parental line and was selected for further testing. In the
parental A375 tumor xenograft model, vemurafenib dosed at
12.5 mg/kg once daily produced 84% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and at 25 mg/kg once daily achieved tumor
regression (Supplementary Table S4). In contrast, in the
vemurafenib-resistant A375R1 melanoma xenograft model,
vemurafenib dosed at 50 mg/kg once daily achieved only
minimal (39%) TGI (Fig. 5). Similarly, MEK inhibitor monotherapy produced minimal TGI ranging from 11% to 44% at
doses up to 50 mg/kg daily (Fig. 5). This conﬁrmed the crossresistance between RAF and MEK inhibitors observed in the
cellular proliferation study. However, using doses that on
their own have minimal effects on tumor growth (50 mg/kg
once daily), combination treatment with vemurafenib and
the MEK inhibitor RO5068760 achieved substantially greater
(>98%) antitumor activity than either agent alone (Fig. 5),
suggesting that the MEK inhibitor restored sensitivity to
vemurafenib in the vemurafenib-resistant melanoma xenograft model. Furthermore, these in vivo results support the
importance of ongoing BRAF inhibition in combination with
MEK inhibition to overcome resistance resulting from reactivated MAPK signaling. These results provide a rationale for
combination clinical trials of vemurafenib with a MEK
inhibitor to inhibit the development or restore the

Combinations of vemurafenib with an AKT inhibitor
show synergistic effects in vemurafenib-resistant cells
As previously mentioned, p-AKT levels were increased in the
vemurafenib-resistant clones compared with vemurafenibsensitive cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that vemurafenib resistance
may also be partly mediated by activating phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K) signaling. Therefore, simultaneously targeting
both BRAF and PI3K pathways may achieve greater proliferation control and overcome resistance. Indeed, in vitro combination with vemurafenib and an AKT inhibitor showed
synergistic antiproliferative effects in the vemurafenib-resistant A375 R1 cells indicated by a CI value of 0.38 at ED90 dose
(Fig. 6A). We also monitored the pharmacodynamic effects of
this combination. As shown in Fig. 6B, simultaneously targeting ERK and AKT signaling resulted in completely abrogation
of the ERK and AKT phosphorylation, inhibition of cell-cycle
progression indicated by decreased cyclin D1 and increased
p27 levels and induction of apoptosis indicated by increased
level of BimEL in the resistant cells (Fig. 6B). Additional studies
are warranted to provide a rationale for clinical trials with
vemurafenib and an AKT or a PI3K inhibitor to prevent the

development of resistance to or to restore the sensitivity to
vemurafenib.

Discussion
Vemurafenib has shown extraordinary results in phase I
clinical evaluation, with 81% of patients with BRAF mutant
melanoma achieving a response (>30% tumor regression) to
treatment (13). However, as noted with previous targeted
anticancer therapies, despite remarkable initial response rates,
sustained clinical utility is often compromised by emergence of
acquired resistance. To develop effective therapeutic strategies
to overcome or prevent such resistance, it is important to
understand the underlying mechanisms of resistance.
In the current study, melanoma cell lines with acquired
resistance to vemurafenib were established by culturing sensitive parental cells under continuous vemurafenib selection to
model disease relapse associated with vemurafenib treatment
in patients with melanoma. This method simulates the chronic
selective pressure that occurs during drug treatment in the
clinic and has successfully identiﬁed clinically relevant
mechanisms of resistance to other agents (24, 25). In addition,
compared with newer, alternative methodologies to identify
targets responsible for drug resistance such as synthetic lethal
screens using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or siRNA libraries,
this method is faster and more economical. This system was,
therefore, used to understand molecular mechanisms of disease relapse after initial response to vemurafenib and subsequently to identify potential combination therapies to prevent
or mitigate emergence of progression.
Consistent with the ex vivo ﬁndings in tumor samples from
the phase I clinical trial of vemurafenib (6, 13), vemurafenib
exposure led to reduced ERK phosphorylation in the sensitive
parental A375 cell line. In contrast, p-ERK levels were elevated
in resistant cell lines and insensitive to vemurafenib inhibition,
consistent with early clinical observations of p-ERK reactivation at disease relapse. Therefore, continued dependence on

976

the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may be an important contributor to tumor cell growth in resistant BRAFV600E-positive
melanoma. Notably, the V600E mutation was retained and no
additional mutations were identiﬁed in the entire coding
region of BRAF gene. However, it was found that BRAF protein
levels were upregulated in the acquired resistant cells. Similar
observations with BCR-ABL-driven tumors were noted in
imatinib-resistant cell lines (26, 27) and relapsed patients
(28). Whether the upregulation of mutant BRAF protein plays
a role in conferring acquired resistance to clinical vemurafenib
treatment is a subject of further investigation.
Investigation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway upstream
of CRAF revealed that RAS-GTP levels were elevated in vemurafenib-acquired resistant cells. Whole exome sequencing
revealed a K117N mutation in KRAS. While this mutation is
uncommon in human tumors (19–22), it has been known for
quite sometime to cause RAS activation in biologic studies (19).
Discovery of this mutation provides a plausible mechanism for
acquired resistance, as it has recently been shown that oncogenic RAS confers resistance to RAF inhibitors (15, 16, 17).
Indeed, an oncogenic NRAS allele was identiﬁed in 2 of 16 (both
came from the same patient) tumor biopsies taken at disease
relapse from patients with melanoma who received vemurafenib therapy (29). Activation of RAS by mutations could,
therefore, explain the elevated levels of RAS-GTP observed in
our resistant cell lines, which subsequently could recruit CRAF
(or BRAF) to the membrane and potentially stabilize and
activate the RAF proteins. Sequencing the KRAS coding region
of 15 relapsing tumor samples revealed no mutations in the
KRAS gene, suggesting the KRAS mutation may happen much
less frequently than NRAS mutations in melanoma. Sequencing
additional relapsing tumors may help solidify the conclusion.
Nonetheless, perhaps the key point of the current discovery is
that modest upstream pathway activation is sufﬁcient for
vemurafenib resistance. This is consistent with the ﬁndings
in patient tumors (6): increasing signaling by less than 50%
could be sufﬁcient to bypass the inhibitor. It will be particularly

Acquired Resistant Mechanisms for Vemurafenib

interesting as more samples are analyzed to see whether
perturbations in proteins involved in RAS activation will be
found in relapsed tumors. This discovery provides optimism
that relapsed tumors can be resensitized to vemurafenib by
combining with a second inhibitor of the same pathway.
Accordingly, combining vemurafenib with the MEK inhibitor RO5068760 restored sensitivity to vemurafenib in the
vemurafenib-resistant cell lines. Notably, as single agents,
neither inhibitor effectively blocked ERK phosphorylation in
resistant cell lines; but in combination, these agents completely
abrogated the elevation of ERK phosphorylation, inhibited cellcycle progression, and induced apoptosis. Indeed, the synergistic induction of apoptosis was greater with combined RAF/
MEK inhibition in the resistant cells compared with the
sensitive cells. The potential downstream signaling change
that may result in this differential apoptosis induction is being
investigated. Importantly, synergistic antitumor activity was
also observed with this combination in the vemurafenib-resistant melanoma xenografts, whereas activity with either agent
alone was minimal. Therefore, addition of MEK inhibition to
tonic BRAF inhibition seems to be sufﬁcient to resuppress ERK
activity in the resistant setting. These ﬁndings, together with
preclinical evidence that combined inhibition of BRAF and
MEK abrogates the emergence of resistance (30), support the
clinical evaluation of combination therapy strategies incorporating MEK inhibition with BRAF inhibitors to combat emerging resistance.
In the course of preparation of this report, 3 reports were
published on vemurafenib resistance mechanisms, showing
that resistance to vemurafenib can be mediated by COT
(MAP3K8), an ERK upstream component, or receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor b
(PDGFRb) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R;
ref. 29, 31, 32). We, therefore, analyzed the expression levels of
COT, PDGFRb, and IGF1R in our resistant cell lines by Western
blotting and quantitative PCR. There were no changes in
protein expression or mRNA levels of IGF1R in our resistant
cell lines compared with the parental cells (Supplementary
Figs. S2 and S3). There were modest changes in the mRNA
levels of PDGFRb and COT; however, the changes did not show
a consistent trend of increased expression, and the protein
expression levels were too low for detection by Western

blotting in all cell lines. On the basis of these expression data,
it appears unlikely that upregulation of COT, PDGFRb, or
IGF1R are potential resistance mechanisms in our model
system. The upregulation of p-AKT levels in our vemurafenib-resistant cells appeared to result from the acquisition of
mutant KRASK117N. This was supported by data showing the
reduction of p-AKT with KRAS knocked down using siRNA in
the vemurafenib-resistant cells (Fig. 3C). In vitro combination
studies with vemurafenib and an AKT inhibitor showed synergistic antiproliferative effects in the vemurafenib-resistant
cell lines. Further investigation of combinations between
vemurafenib and PI3K pathway inhibitors in xenograft models
is warranted to provide a rationale for conducting combination
clinical trials with such agents in patients with BRAF mutant
tumors with deregulated PI3K signaling.
It is becoming apparent that the development achieving
sustainable remissions with molecularly targeted anticancer
therapies will require preemptive attention to potential escape
pathways. The results of this study further support this concept
and provide a rationale for clinical trials incorporating coadministration of vemurafenib with MEK or PI3K pathway
inhibitors to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance.
