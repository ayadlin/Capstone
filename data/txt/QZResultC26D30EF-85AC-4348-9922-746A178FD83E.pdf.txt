ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by limited response to current
drug therapies. Here, we report that SC66, a novel AKT inhibitor, reduced cell viability
in a dose- and time-dependent manner, inhibited colony formation and induced
apoptosis in HCC cells. SC66 treatment led to a reduction in total and phosphoAKT levels. This was associated with alterations in cytoskeleton organization, a
reduction in expression levels of E-cadherin, β-catenin and phospho-FAK, together
with up-regulation of Snail protein levels. All these alterations were coupled with
anoikis cell death induction. In addition, SC66 induced the production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. Pre-treatment with the ROS scavenger
N-Acetyl-cysteine (NAC) prevented SC66-induced cell growth inhibition and anoikis.
SC66 significantly potentiated the effects of both conventional chemotherapeutic and
targeted agents, doxorubicin and everolimus, respectively. In vivo, SC66 inhibited
tumor growth of Hep3B cells in xenograft models, with a similar mechanism observed
in the in vitro model. Taken together, these data indicate that the AKT inhibitor SC66
had antitumor effects on HCC cells. This was mediated by ROS production, induction
of anoikis-mediated cell death and inhibition of the AKT cell survival pathway. Our
results provide a rational basis for the use of SC66 in HCC treatment.

drugs such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil
have very limited efficacy [5].
Today, sorafenib, a Raf kinase inhibitor approved
by the FDA and EMEA for the treatment of patients with
advanced and unresectable HCC, is the only systemic
therapy which improves survival in HCC patients [6].
Although sorafenib improves prognosis in advanced HCC,
response to sorafenib remains low and the median overall
survival is only extended by a few months [6–10].
The development of new specific therapies is
necessary. However, recent knowledge of the oncogenic
processes and signaling pathways that regulate tumor cell

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common cancer worldwide, characterized by an increasing
incidence and a poor prognosis [1–5]. HCC is largely
asymptomatic until it is in the advanced state when the
treatments available are often unsuccessful. The standard
treatments are surgical resection and liver transplantation,
but they are indicated only in specific conditions, however
both are rarely successful. Other treatments, such as
chemoablation, focused ultrasound and radiation also
rarely lead to complete recovery [5]. Standard cancer

proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, invasion and
metastasis has led to the identification of several potential
molecular targets and to the development of specific
targeted molecular therapies.
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is involved
in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation,
migration, survival and angiogenesis. In PI3K/AKT/
mTOR signaling, activated receptors trigger the activation
of PI3K and the conversion (by its catalytic domain), of
phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP2) lipid to
phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). AKT
binds to PIP3 at the plasma membrane, allowing PDK1
to phosphorylate AKT to T308, leading to partial AKT
activation [11, 12]. Phosphorylation of AKT at S473, either
by mTOR [13] or by DNA-PK [14], stimulates full AKT
activity. Full activation of AKT leads to additional substratespecific phosphorylation events in both the cytoplasm and
nucleus [15]. Fully-active AKT mediates numerous cellular
functions including angiogenesis, metabolism, growth,
proliferation, survival, protein synthesis, transcription and
apoptosis.
Phosphorylation of AKT at S473 has been detected
in up to 71% of HCC samples and associated with the
invasion, metastasis, and vascularization of HCC [16].
Activated AKT positively modulates mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) function. mTOR phos­
phorylates components of the protein synthesis machinery,
such as the serine-threonine kinase p70S6 (40S ribosomal
protein kinase) and the translation repressor eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), both
regulating the translation of important factors involved in
cell proliferation (such as c-myc, cyclic D1 and pRb) and
angiogenesis (such as HIF1-α). Aberrant mTOR signaling
has also been detected in up to 48% of HCC cases, and a
correlation between poor outcome and mTOR signaling
activation has been shown [17, 18]. These results make
the AKT/mTOR signaling a promising target for new
therapies in HCC [19–22].
However, the clinical relevance of the AKT/mTOR
pathway as a key target in HCC and its therapeutic
potential as a target for therapy remain to be elucidated.
Recently, the novel AKT inhibitor SC66 has been
demonstrated to promote cell death in cervical cancer
through disruption of mTOR signaling [23]. SC66 is
an allosteric inhibitor which displays a dual-inhibitory
function toward AKT activity: i) deactivation by facilitated
ubiquitination, and ii) inhibition by directly interfering
with the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binding to
PIP3 [24].
In this study, we analyzed the antitumor activity of
SC66 in HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated
that treatment with SC66 induced cell growth inhibition,
inhibition of colony formation and anoikis through ROS
production. SC66 significantly inhibited cell viability in
combination with doxorubicin and everolimus. SC66 was
also effective in in vivo xenograft-bearing mice where
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

it displays significant tumor growth reduction. These
findings suggest that SC66 might represent a promising
new therapeutic drug for HCC treatment.

RESULTS
SC66 inhibits cell viability and colony forming
capacity of HCC cells
To investigate the effects of SC66 on HCC cell
viability, HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5 and
HA22T/VGH cell lines were incubated with increasing
concentrations of SC66 and cell viability was analyzed
after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Our results demonstrated that
treatment with SC66 reduced cell viability in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Figure 1A). Each cell line had a
different sensitivity to the drug, as evidenced by the IC50
values shown in Table 1. HepG2, HA22T/VGH and PLC/
PRF/5 cells had similar IC50 values of approximately 0.85
and 0.75 μg/ml at 48 and 72 hours, respectively. The most
resistant cell line was Huh7, which showed an IC50 of
3.1 and 2.8 μg/ml at 48 and 72 hours respectively, while
the Hep3B cell line was found to be the most sensitive,
with an IC50 of 0.75 and 0.5 μg/ml at 48 and 72 hours,
respectively. For example, at 24 hours the highest dose
tested (4 μg/ml) inhibited Huh7 cell viability by almost
30% and Hep3B cell viability by almost 90% (Figure 1A),
therefore we selected these two cell lines for all further
experiments.
Next, we performed a colony forming assay (Figure
1B), which mimics the clonogenic survival of tumor cells
in a solid tumor environment. SC66 displayed a strong
inhibition of colony forming capacity, and this type of
assay also confirmed that Hep3B cells have a higher
sensitivity to the drug than Huh7 cells (Figure 1B).

SC66 induces apoptosis
To determine whether the decrease in cell viability
was related to apoptosis induction, TUNEL assays were
performed in Hep3B and Huh7 cells treated with 1, 2
and 4 μg/ml of SC66 for 24 hours. As shown in Figure
2A, in Hep3B cells the number of TUNEL-positive cells
increased with increasing concentrations of SC66, whereas
in Huh7 cells very few light brown-colored cells were
observed only after treatment with 4 μg/ml SC66.
Apoptosis was also quantified by flow cytometry
analysis of DNA stained with propidium iodide and by
determining the percentage of events accumulating in
the subG1 position (Figure 2B). Treatment with 2 μg/
ml SC66 increased apoptotic Hep3B cells to 17.5% ±
0.3 compared to control, whereas the percentage of
apoptotic cells was only 4.5% ± 0.8 in the more resistant
Huh7 cells. Consistent with the apoptosis detected
in Hep3B cells, the kinetics of caspase-3/7 activity
measured by fluorometric caspase-3/7 assay showed

early activation of caspase-3/7 starting as little as 1 hour
after treatment (Figure 2C). Caspase activity after 1, 3
and 6 hours of SC66 exposure was significantly higher
in Hep3B cells treated with SC66 2 and 4 μg/ml than in
Hep3B cells treated with vehicle alone (p < 0.001). In
Huh7 cells, we observed a 1.3 fold increase in caspase
activity only at 24 hours and only with the highest drug
dose (data not shown).
Finally, Western blot analysis of protein extracted
from Hep3B cells after treatment for 24 hours with 2
and 4 μg/ml SC66 showed a dose-response cleavage of
PARP and a decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and
survivin (Figure 2D). In Huh7 cells after SC66 treatment
the same proteins maintained the baseline levels observed
in untreated cells (Figure 2D).
All these analyses highlight that the decrease in
cell viability observed after SC66 treatment was due to
apoptosis induction.

Silencing of AKT partially overlaps the effects
of SC66

SC66 affects AKT/mTOR signaling in HCC
cell lines

The above results prompted us to investigate whether
any additional mechanism(s) that could be responsible for
the effects of SC66 activity on cell viability. Microscopic
examination revealed that when exposed to increased
concentrations of the drug the more sensitive Hep3B cells
became rounded, slightly attached to each other, similar
to beads on a string, and detached from the substrate,
losing contact with extracellular matrix molecules (ECM)
(Figure 4A). No evident effects were visible in Huh7 cells
treated at the same drug doses and at the same treatment
times (Figure 4A). Following these observations we
hypothesized that in Hep3B cells SC66 might induce
anoikis, a form of programmed cell death resulting from
the loss of cell adhesion to the ECM [25–31]. Therefore,
certain markers of anoikis, such as cytoskeleton and
cell membrane-associated proteins, were analyzed. To
observe the distribution of cytoskeleton microfilaments
after treatment with SC66, Hep3B cells were stained with
both phalloidin, which specifically stains actin filament,
and with anti-vimentin antibody. As shown in Figure 4B,
changes in distribution of actin and vimentin occurred
after drug treatment, and in particular the latter seemed to
slightly increase and accumulate in the perinuclear zone
(Figure 4B). Western blot analysis also showed a reduction
in E-cadherin expression levels and an induction of Snail,
the negative regulator transcription factor of E-cadherin
(CDH1) gene (Figure 4C) [32].
We also evaluated β-catenin protein levels as it is a
component of adhesion complexes. As shown in Figure 4C
β-catenin levels decreased after SC66 treatment.

To evaluate how dependent the effects of SC66
were on target AKT expression, we silenced the AKT
gene with a specific small interference RNA (siRNA).
Although, after silencing of AKT by siRNA, AKT
protein expression was reduced by 80% after 72 hours,
AKT silencing reduced cell viability by almost 50% only
after 7 days (Figure 3B). At the morphological level, no
morphological features of apoptosis were observed in cells
transfected with AKT siRNA (not shown). Therefore, the
effect observed was less strong than the one observed
using the pharmacological approach with SC66. These
results suggest that the effects of SC66 are only partially
AKT-dependent.

SC66 induces anoikis

As SC66 is a novel allosteric AKT inhibitor
which directly interacts with AKT and facilitates its
ubiquitination and deactivation [24], we investigated
whether the cytotoxic effects of SC66 were related to
changes in AKT signaling. Western blot analysis was
performed after SC66 treatment. As observed in Figure 3,
the dose-response curve showed a slight increase in
phospho-AKT expression levels in the presence of SC66
at concentrations of 1 and 2 μg/ml, whereas phospho-AKT
expression levels dramatically decreased after treatment
with 4 μg/ml SC66 (Figure 3A). Analysis of total AKT
protein levels revealed a decrease in protein already at a
dose of 2 μg/ml SC66 in Hep3B cells. In Huh7 cells, we
observed a slight effect on AKT expression levels only
after treatment with 4 μg/ml SC66 (Figure 3).
We also examined phosphorylation levels of mTOR,
a well-established down-stream target of activated AKT.
SC66 treatment resulted in a significant fall in mTOR
phosphorylation in Hep3B cells (Figure 3A). To confirm
the modulation of mTOR signaling, we evaluated the
phosphorylation levels of 4E-BP1 protein, a mTOR
downstream target. Treatment with 4 μg/ml SC66
reduced phospho-4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1) and of total
4E-BP1 protein levels in Hep3B cells (Figure 3A). In
Huh7 cells, we observed a slight effect on both p-4E-BP1
and total 4E-BP1 expression levels after treatment with
SC66 (Figure 3).

SC66 induces ROS production in Hep3B cells

hypothesis we evaluated cell viability after SC66 treatment
with and without NAC. The histograms in Figure 6A
demonstrated that the presence of NAC reverted the effects
of SC66 on cell viability at low drug doses, whereas it
partially inhibited the effects at 4 μg/ml. At the molecular
level, Western blot analysis also showed an almost complete
recovery of phosphorylated and total AKT levels in Hep3B
cells treated with SC66 in the presence of NAC (Figure 6C),
as well as inhibition of PARP cleavage (Figure 6C).
As mentioned above, many drugs may sensitize
cancer cells to anoikis through ROS generation. In the
presence of NAC, a reduction in the number of rounded
and floating Hep3B cells was observed, with cells spread
on the plate surface even when treated with SC66,
suggesting that NAC also abrogates the phenotypic effects
of SC66 on cell morphology (Figure 6B).
In addition, Western blot analysis demonstrated that
after treatment with SC66 in the presence of NAC both
E-cadherin and FAK phosphorylation levels were almost
restored (Figure 6D), therefore we can assume that anoikis
was induced by SC66 via ROS production.
ROS are known to induce DNA damage, therefore
we evaluated the expression of the phosphorylated form
of H2AX (γ-H2AX), a well-known marker of double
strand DNA breaks (DSBs). γH2AX was strongly induced

Many compounds may sensitize cancer cells to anoikis
through ROS generation [33–36]. In addition, ROS have
also been reported to be important mediators of anoikis and
also to be related to caspase activation [34, 36]. Consequently,
we investigated whether SC66 antitumor activities in HCC
cells were initiated through ROS generation.
Using the cell-permeable fluorescent probe H2DCFDA,
we found that SC66 treatment induced intracellular ROS
production in Hep3B cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 5). Treatment with antioxidants, such as N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, should abrogate ROS
effects. For this purpose cells were pretreated with 2 mM
NAC for 2 hours before being treated with SC66. As shown
in Figure 5 the intensity of the fluorescence probe increased
in the presence of SC66, and decreased when cells were
treated with SC66 in the presence of NAC.

Treatment with NAC reverts the cytotoxic
effects of SC66 in Hep3B cells
We hypothesized that by inhibiting ROS effects
NAC might revert the effects of SC66 on cell viability, and
also inhibit SC66-induced anoikis. In order to validate this

SC66 significantly potentiates the effects of
doxorubicin and everolimus in Hep3B cells

after SC66 treatment and returned to the baseline levels
of untreated cells after treatment with NAC (Figure 6C).
These results suggested that ROS generation promotes
DNA damage in Hep3B cells treated with SC66 and
therefore contributes to cell death induction.

which is used in clinical protocols for HCC treatment, or
with new target specific drugs, such as the mTOR inhibitor
everolimus (also known as RAD001), currently under
clinical trials in different cancer types, including HCC. We
measured the cytotoxic effects after 24 hours of combination
of SC66 with doxorubicin and with everolimus in both
HCC cell lines using MTS assays (Figure 7). Hep3B and
Huh7 cells were treated with SC66 at a single concentration
(1 μg/ml) and two different concentrations of doxorubicin
(62.5 and 125 nM) (Figure 7A), or three concentrations of
everolimus (10-50-100 nM) (Figure 7B). In comparison
with single treatments, combination treatments significantly
reduced cell viability only in Hep3B cells.

of 6 animals each. The treated group received SC66 at 15
and 25 mg/Kg twice a week via i.p. injection, while the
untreated group received the vehicle alone. Treatment with
25 mg/Kg SC66 significantly reduced tumor volume to 37%
on day 17 when compared with tumors of the untreated
group (Figure 8A). Changes in animal body weight were
also monitored. As observed in Figure 8B, mice treated
with 25 mg/kg SC66 did not show a significant loss of body
weight when compared with mice treated with vehicle
alone, suggesting a satisfactory level of drug cytotoxicity.
Western blot analysis performed on homogenates
from tumor tissues of mice treated with SC66 showed
lower p-AKT levels (Figure 8C) than those of untreated
mice. Unexpectedly, we did not observe the reduction in
total AKT levels found in in vitro studies. Nevertheless,
immunohistochemical analysis showed an increase in the
number of apoptotic cells (TUNEL assays), and a lower
proliferation marker Ki-67 expression in tumor tissues
from animals treated with SC66, than in the tissues of the
untreated animals (Figure 8D).

on HCC, a mouse xenograft tumor model of Hep3B cells

DISCUSSION

its activation induces cell proliferation and increases
survival and therapy resistance, in the present study we
investigated the potential antitumor activity of SC66, a
novel allosteric inhibitor of AKT activity, on HCC cell
lines. SC66 affects AKT/mTOR signaling in HCC cells as
shown by a decrease in AKT phosphorylation levels and
in total protein levels. Following signaling inactivation we
also found a reduction in the levels of mTOR and 4E-BP1
phosphorylation, downstream targets of AKT signaling.

HCC is the predominant form of primary liver
cancer and the third cause of cancer-related death
worldwide. The survival rate for most HCC patients
is extremely low, due to the lack of appropriate and
effective therapy, therefore developing novel therapeutic
strategies is a high priority. Considering that the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway is a key pathway in HCC, as

SC66 decreased cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent
manner in all the HCC cell lines studied. However, each
cell line demonstrated a different sensitivity to the drug,
with Hep3B cells being the most sensitive cell line, and
Huh7 cells the least responsive. The reasons for the
different behavior remain elusive and the mechanism(s)
of resistance to SC66 has to be elucidated. One possibility
could be related to the different characteristics of
differentiation, biological behavior and genetic defects
of the different cell lines reflecting the heterogeneity
observed in primary HCC tissues.
Inhibition of cell viability in Hep3B cells was
associated with apoptosis induction, which correlated
with caspase-3/7 activation, PARP cleavage and downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and survivin.
However, the Hep3B cells did not display the
classical morphological features of apoptotic cells.
After treatment with SC66 in Hep3B cells, we observed
strong changes in morphology causing a loss of cell
contact with the extracellular matrix molecules. The cells
became rounded, slightly attached to each other, similar
to beads on a string, and were floating. The hypothesis
that the cell death observed might be anoikis, a form of
apoptosis resulting from the loss of cell adhesion to the
extracellular matrix molecules [26–31], was confirmed
by the following observations: first, a down-regulation
of E-cadherin levels and an up-regulation of Snail (the
negative regulator transcription factor of the E-cadherin
(CDH1) gene) [32], both considered to be markers of
anoikis [28–32]; second, changes in the distribution
of vimentin which slightly increased and accumulated
in the perinuclear zone; third, a redistribution of actin
cytoskeleton as observed after staining with phalloidin;
and finally, a clear reduction in the phosphorylated form
of FAK, a kinase that regulates cell adhesion and acts as
a signal transducer in response to integrins [37, 38]. It is
worth noting that cells which became non-adherent after
SC66 exposure were not able to re-adhere to the plate
after the inhibitor was removed, suggesting that the death
program was irreversible.
Many compounds may sensitize cancer cell to
anoikis through ROS generation [33–36]. ROS have
been reported to be important mediators of anoikis and
are related to caspase activation [33, 36]. Recent evidence
suggests that disruption of integrin contact with fibroblasts
can lead to cell detachment which is preceded by a rise in
intracellular ROS levels [31]. On the other hand, it has
been demonstrated that detachment of endothelial cells
resulted in a dramatic rise in ROS levels and, furthermore,
that this rise contributed to anoikis [34]. On the basis of
this evidence and our observations, we ascertained the
effects of SC66 on ROS production. Measurement of ROS
levels demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in ROS
after treatment with SC66, suggesting that anoikis might
be due to the presence of high levels of ROS, as confirmed
by the reversion of SC66 effects on cell morphology, cell

viability, E-cadherin and vimentin levels as well as on
FAK phosphorylation observed after treatment with the
antioxidant NAC. In cells co-treated with the antioxidant,
an almost complete recovery of phosphorylated and total
AKT was also observed, as well as inhibition of PARP
cleavage. Finally, levels of γH2AX, known to be a marker
of DNA damage, were strongly increased after SC66
treatment and levels in treated cells returned to baseline
after treatment with NAC.
Interestingly, SC66 significantly potentiates the
effects of both conventional chemotherapeutic drug
(doxorubicin) and molecularly targeted anticancer agent
(everolimus), offering new opportunity for treatment
of HCC.
In summary, our in vitro results demonstrated for
the first time that SC66 affects HCC cell growth and this
was due to the inhibition of AKT pathways and ROS
induction, and that both of these contributed to HCC
cell death. Furthermore, the antitumor effects of SC66
were confirmed in vivo. In the mouse xenograft tumor
model of Hep3B cells, SC66 treatment significantly
reduced tumor volume to 37% on day 17 of treatment
when compared with tumors in the untreated group. The
inhibition of cell growth correlated with a reduction in
phospho-AKT levels in the tumors of animals treated
with SC66. However, unexpectedly, we did not observe
the reduction in total AKT levels observed in vitro, and
the reason for this result is not understood. Nevertheless,
immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a reduction in
cell proliferation markers and a higher degree of apoptosis
in tumor tissues examined from xenograft mice treated
with SC66 than in controls.
Overall, our results for the first time highlight the
potential of the novel AKT inhibitor SC66 as a therapeutic
drug for HCC treatment, providing the rationale for future
experimental use in humans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, cell culture and reagents
The human hepatocarcinoma cell lines HepG2,
Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B and HA22T/VGH used in this
study had a low passage number and were maintained
in RPMI medium (SIGMA, Milan, Italy), containing
10% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (GIBCO, Life
Technologies, Monza MB, Italy). HepG2, Huh-7 and
HA22T/VGH cells used in this study were a gift from
Prof. M. Levrero (Department of Internal Medicine,
Sapienza University, Rome, Italy). Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5
cells used in this study were a gift from Prof. O. Bussolati
(Unit of General and Clinical Pathology, Department of
Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma,
Italy). The HCC cell lines have different characteristics
of differentiation, biological behavior and genetic defects
[39]. SC66 was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann

Arbor, MI, USA). Doxorubicin and everolimus (RAD001)
were purchased from SIGMA.

After 24 hours of SC66 treatment, 1 x 106 cells were
collected and stained with propidium iodide (PI)
(Invitrogen) and the percentage of apoptotic cells was
determined as previously described [39].

Cell viability assays
Cells (5 x 103/well) were distributed into each well
of 96-well microtiter plates and then incubated overnight.
At time 0, the medium was replaced with fresh complete
medium and different doses of SC66 were added. Cells
were cultured for 24, 48 and 72 hours. At the end of
treatment, MTS assays were performed using the CellTiter
Aqueous OneSolution kit (Promega Corporation, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the
absorbance measured in the control cells. Values were
expressed as means ± SD of three separate experiments,
each performed in triplicate. In recovery experiments, cells
were pre-treated with the antioxidant N-Acetyl-cysteine
(NAC) (SIGMA) for 2 hours and then the drug was added.

Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
The intracellular accumulation of ROS was determined
using the fluorescent probe 2’,7’-difluorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA) (Invitrogen). Cells (2 x 105) were
treated with various concentrations of SC66 for the indicated
time and then incubated with the probe (1 μM) in the dark
at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 15 min. Cells were observed with
fluorescence microscopy (Leica GmbH, Germany) and
photographed.

TUNEL assays
Cells (2 x 104/well) were cultured in 8-well
chamber slides overnight. After treatment for 24 hours
with various concentrations of SC66, cells were washed
twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
solution for 25 min at room temperature. Apoptotic cells
were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay using
the DeadEndTM Colorimetric TUNEL System Kit from
Promega, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells
were visualized with an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany).

Caspase activity assays
Cells (2 x 104/well) were treated with 2 and 4 μg/ml
SC66 and after 1, 3 and 6 hours the levels of caspase3/7
activities in the cells were measured by the Caspase-Glo®
3/7 Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Results were expressed as relative luminescence
units (RLU). Values were the mean ± SD of two separate
experiments, each performed in duplicate.

Western blot analysis

Colony formation assays

Whole cellular lysates from 0.5 x 106 cells were
obtained using RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies
Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) and Western blots were
performed using the methodology for the Odyssey®
infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, NE,
USA). After transfer nitrocellulose membranes were
placed in Odyssey® blocking buffer (OBB, LI-COR)
diluted in tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated for
1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies were
diluted in OBB. Secondary antibodies conjugated to
IRDye® 800CW (LI-COR) or Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular
Probes, Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA, USA) were diluted in
OBB. Membranes were scanned and analyzed with an
Odyssey IR scanner using Odyssey 3.0 imaging software.
Antibody signals were analyzed as integrated intensities
of regions defined around the bands of interest in either
channel, with primary antibodies raised against survivin
(Abcam Limited, Cambridge, UK), β-actin (SIGMA),
phospho-AKT, AKT, phospho-mTOR, mTOR, phospho4E-BP1, 4E-BP1, PARP and Bcl2 (Cell Signaling
Technologies), phospho-FAK, E-cadherin and β-catenin
(BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, USA),
Snail (Santa Cruz, Dallas, Texas, USA).

Cells (1.0 x 103/well) were plated in six-well plates
in growth medium, and after overnight attachment cells
were exposed either to SC66 or vehicle for 48 hours. The
cells were then washed and allowed to grow for 14 days
in drug-free conditions, after which the cell colonies were
fixed with 70% ethanol at 4°C for 20 min and stained with
crystal violet (0.1% in H2O) for 5 min. The plates were
rinsed with water, air-dried, photographed and evaluated
for colony estimation. Colonies containing more than
50 cells were counted. All experiments were performed in
duplicate and repeated twice.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection
Hep3B cells (3 x 105) were cultured in 6-well plates
in 2 ml of RPMI medium in 10% FBS. After 24 hours the
cells at 30–50% confluences were transfected in serumfree medium with pre-validated human AKT siRNA
(Qiagen, Germantown, MD, US) or control (scrambled)
siRNA (Qiagen) at a final concentration of 50 nM, using
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. 24 hours after transfection

in sodium citrate solution (pH 6.0) at 96°C for 20 min.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min. Then the slides
were treated with 1% BSA for 30 min and incubated for
1 hour at room temperature in the presence of 0.1% BSA
with a monoclonal rabbit antibody for nuclear antigen,
Ki-67 (1:100) (Biocare Medical, CRM325). At the end,
the sections were treated for 30 min with secondary
biotinylated immunoglobulin anti-rabbit antibody
(DAKO, LSAB Kit, K0690, Denmark). The sections
were then incubated with a streptavidin-horseradish
peroxidase conjugate for 1 hour, followed by chromogen
3-3′ diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for 1 min, and
counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. The specific
primary antibody was replaced with PBS in tissue sections
used as negative controls. All immunostained sections were
analyzed at a × 400 magnification (five fields). Images of
stained slides were captured using Leica DMR microscope
equipped with a Leica DFC 320 digital camera.
Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay
using the DeadEndTM Colorimetric TUNEL System Kit
from Promega, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were visualized with an Axioskop microscope
(Zeiss).

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells (2 x 105/well) were cultured in 8-well chamber
slides. After 24 hours cells were treated with SC66, after
which they were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for
15 minutes, and permealized using 0.25% Triton-X-100
for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then
incubated for 1 hour with monoclonal anti-vimentin
antibody (Santa Cruz) in 1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS at room temperature in a moist chamber.
Immunofluorescence staining was obtained by incubation
for 1 hour with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa
Fluor 555 (Invitrogen). Actin staining was performed
using phalloidin (SIGMA) and incubated with cells for 30
min at room temperature. Cells were counterstained with
DAPI, mounted on slides and examined with fluorescence
microscope (Zeiss).

In vivo studies
Male nude athymic mice (Fox1 nu/nu) aged 4
weeks were obtained from Harlan (Udine, Italy) and
allowed to acclimatize for 1 week. Suspensions of
10 × 106 Hep3B cells in 0.2 ml of PBS were inoculated into
the right flank of the animal. When tumors became palpable
(around 150 mm3), the mice were randomly divided into
three groups of 6 animals each, with the various tumor
volumes equally distributed among the three groups. Two
groups of mice were treated twice a week with 15 and 25
mg/Kg SC66 suspended in DMSO, further diluted in a
solution of 25% ethanol and administered via i.p. injection.
The control group received the vehicle alone. Tumor
volumes were determined twice a week using calipers.
Primary tumor volumes were calculated with the formula:
v = length × (width)2/2. Mice were euthanized by cervical
dislocation when the tumor burden exceeded 10% of animal
body weight, or when tumor ulcerated or other conditions of
morbidity were ascertained, in conformity with institutional
guidelines which are in compliance with national (D.L., 116
G.U., Suppl.40; 18 February 1992) and international laws
and policies (ECC Council Directive 86/609, OJ L358.1, 12
December 1987). This study was authorized by the Italian
Ministry of Health (D.M. n. 39/2014-B).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s
two-tailed t test. Statistical significance was p < 0.05.
