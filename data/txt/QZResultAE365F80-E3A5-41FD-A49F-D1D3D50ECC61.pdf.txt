other patients to be treated too conservatively, increasing diseaserelated mortality. One way to help improve the management of
breast cancer would be to use markers that can accurately predict
disease course.
Modifier genes may offer usefulness in this regard given their
effects on dormancy versus progression in the context of certain
oncogenic pathways that drive neoplasia (1, 2). Alterations in the
structure or regulation of a candidate modifier gene that correlates
with progression status can offer one line of evidence for a marker.
By evaluating alterations in an animal model, one can directly
determine whether they are coincidental or causal to disease. To
identify disease modifier genes, classic genetics can be used to
map genes by ‘‘top-down’’ designs or reverse genetics can be used
to assess candidates via ‘‘bottom-up’’ designs, with the understanding that a candidate will be phenotypically silent in the
absence of relevant oncogenic lesions. In the present study, we
used the latter approach to test the hypothesis that Bin1 acts as a
negative modifier of breast cancer progression.
Bin1 encodes a nucleocytosolic BAR adapter protein that can
interact with the c-Myc oncoprotein and inhibit its cell transforming activity (3–5). c-Myc is involved in the development of
many human breast cancers where its overexpression has been
associated with poor prognosis (6). At least 10 splice isoforms of
Bin1 exist, with differences in the pattern of tissue distribution,
subcellular localization, and protein interactions that indicate
diverse functional roles (7–10). BAR adapter proteins include a
signature fold termed the BAR domain that recognizes curved
vesicular membranes (11). Although BAR adapter proteins have a
canonical function in membrane dynamics (12), in certain family
members that localize to the nucleus (e.g., including Bin1 and
APPL proteins), a moonlighting function in transcriptional
regulation has been suggested (4, 5, 13). Notably, only those Bin1
isoforms that are capable of localizing to the nucleus are capable
of suppressing oncogenic transformation, facilitating cell suicide,
and promoting immune escape of transformed cells in various
model systems (3, 4, 14–20). Although attenuation of Bin1 by
silencing or missplicing is a frequent event in many human
cancers, including breast cancer (3, 16), the consequences of Bin1
loss on tumor progression have not been addressed directly in a
preclinical model of disease. Therefore, we tested whether such
losses were sufficient to drive initiation or progression of cancers
in mice harboring mammary gland–specific deletions of Bin1.

Abstract
Genes that modify oncogenesis may influence dormancy
versus progression in cancer, thereby affecting clinical outcomes. The Bin1 gene encodes a nucleocytosolic adapter
protein that interacts with and suppresses the cell transforming activity of Myc. Bin1 is often attenuated in breast
cancer but its ability to negatively modify oncogenesis or
progression in this context has not been gauged directly. In
this study, we investigated the effects of mammary gland–
specific deletion of Bin1 on initiation and progression of
breast cancer in mice. Bin1 loss delayed the outgrowth and
involution of the glandular ductal network during pregnancy
but had no effect on tumor susceptibility. In contrast, in mice
where tumors were initiated by the ras-activating carcinogen
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, Bin1 loss strongly accentuated the formation of poorly differentiated tumors characterized by increased proliferation, survival, and motility. This
effect was specific as Bin1 loss did not accentuate progression
of tumors initiated by an overexpressed mouse mammary
tumor virus-c-myc transgene, which on its own produced
poorly differentiated and aggressive tumors. These findings
suggest that Bin1 loss cooperates with ras activation to drive
progression, establishing a role for Bin1 as a negative
modifier of oncogenicity and progression in breast cancer.

Introduction
Breast cancer is currently the second leading cause of cancerrelated death among women. In recent years, medical advances
have improved detection at earlier stages, such that women with
small localized breast tumors will tend to have a good prognosis
after treatment. However, up to 20% of patients with ‘good
prognosis’ will nevertheless relapse within 5 years with advanced
disease. Conversely, patients considered to have a poorer prognosis
are not necessarily fated to relapse with disease. Thus, the limited
prognostic information available may cause some patients to be
treated too aggressively, increasing therapy-related morbidity, and

Bin1 flox allele were 5¶-TGGAGTCTGCCACCTTCTATCC-3¶ (loxP1) and
5¶GCTCATACACCTCCTGAAGACAC3¶ (loxP2; Integrated DNA Technologies,
Inc.) with expected sizes of 0.9, 1.07, and 0.31 kb for WT, flox, and
recombined flox ( floxD) alleles, respectively. Following a 4-min denaturation at 94jC, 35 cycles of PCR were done at 94jC for 20 s, 58jC for 1 min,
and 72jC for 1 min with the addition of a 10-min final elongation step at
72jC. The primers and PCR conditions used to monitor the Bin1 KO allele
have been described (22). The primers used to monitor the wap-cre gene
were 5¶-GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3¶ (Wap1) and 5¶-GTGAAACAGCATTGCTGTCACTT-3¶(Wap2) with allele-positive mice identified by a
single 100-bp agarose gel band. PCR conditions for the wap-cre gene were
as follows: after a 4-min denaturation at 94jC, 40 cycles of PCR were done
at 94jC for 30 s, 62jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 1 min with the addition of a
5-min final elongation step at 72jC. The primers used to monitor the
MMTV-c-myc gene were 5¶-CCCAAGGCTTAAGTAAGTTTTTGG-3¶ (Myc1)
and 5¶-GGGCATAAGCACAGATAAAACACT-3¶ (Myc2) with allele-positive
mice identified by a single 880-bp agarose gel band. PCR conditions for the
MMTV-c-myc gene were as follows: after a 3-min denaturation at 96jC, 39
cycles of PCR were done at 96jC for 30 s, 58jC for 1 min, and 72jC for
1 min with the addition of a 5-min final elongation step at 72jC.
Mammary gland carcinogenesis. After one round of pregnancy, female
mice received s.c. implants in the intrascapular area of two compressed
pellets of 20 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (Hormone Pellet Press).
Three weeks later, we gave the first of four weekly doses of 50 mg/kg 7,12dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), given p.o. in
cottonseed oil, with the three subsequent doses delivered 1, 3, and 4 weeks
after the first dose. On this regimen, we observed mammary tumors to
appear with a frequency of f100% with an average latency of 112 days,4
not significantly longer than the 99 days reported for CD2F1 (BALB/
CXDBA/2) mice (23).
Cell biology. Murine mammary epithelial cells (MMEC) explanted from
breast tumors were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; HyClone) and antibiotics. Cells were passaged multiple times at a 1:4
passage ratio to rid explanted tissue of contaminating fibroblasts and other
cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses with E-cadherin and
h-catenin antibodies (see below) were done to confirm the epithelial nature
of MMEC cultures established in this manner. Cell proliferation assays were
done by seeding 1  106 cells in 100-mm dishes and harvesting at various
times later for counting by trypan blue exclusion (24). For serum
deprivation, cells were treated the day after seeding them into culture for
24 h with DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. For anchorage-independent growth,
1  104 cells were seeded in soft agar, and colony formation was
documented as described previously (24). For flow cytometry, cells were
harvested, washed once with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with
propidium iodide, and analyzed on a FACScan device (Becton Dickinson).
For motility assays, 1  106 cells were seeded in a 100 AL droplet in
individual wells of a six-well plate and incubated for 16 h. When cells
reached confluency within the droplet, its center was scratched, 2 mL
DMEM plus 10% FBS was added to the well, and motility was documented
at 48 h by photomicrography.
Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested by washing thrice in PBS
before lysis in 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [1 PBS
containing 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 Ag/mL
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] with 10 AL/mL Protease Inhibitor Set II
and III (Calbiochem). Protein was quantitated by Bradford assay and
50 Ag protein per sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were processed by standard Western blotting methods using the Bin1 antibody
2F11 (ammonium sulfate supernatant, 1:200 dilution) and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2,000
dilution; Cell Signaling). For actin, a primary anti-actin goat polyclonal
antibody was used (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biochemicals) and HRPconjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution; Southern
Biotechnology Associates). For cell adhesion proteins, primary antibodies

Bin1 gene (21). Three ES cell lines with the desired homologous
recombination event were infected with a recombinant Cre adenovirus
and subcloned to identify cell colonies that had selectively lost the neo
marker, leaving intact the desired floxed exon 3 segment. These correctly
targeted ES cell lines were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and
chimeric animals with germ-line transmission of the floxed Bin1 allele were
generated. Bin1 is haplosufficient for viability (22). Therefore, to establish
the most efficient system for producing Bin1-expressing or nonexpressing
cells by a single Cre-mediated excision event, we crossed the ‘floxed’
allele ( flox) onto a strain with the ‘straight’ knockout (KO) allele (22). Cre
recombinase was introduced by interbreeding with B6129-Tg(wap-cre)11738
Mam/J(wap-cre mice) (The Jackson Laboratory). Activated c-myc was
introduced by interbreeding with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)c-myc. FVB-N mice (Charles River Laboratories) under a license from DuPont
Medical Products (Wilmington, DE).
Genotype analysis. PCR was used to genotype mice as follows. Mouse
tissue samples were digested overnight at 60jC in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1% SDS, 30 Ag/mL
proteinase K]. DNA-containing supernatant was diluted 1:50 in 10 mmol/L
Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 2 AL of diluted supernantant were used for PCR in a
final volume of 20 AL in a PTC-2000 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research).
Amplification products were separated by electroporation on 2% agarose
gels prestained with ethidium bromide, using HaeIII-digested BX174 phage
DNA (Fisher) as a molecular size marker. The primers used to monitor the

used included anti-E-cadherin (1:1,000 dilution; clone 36, Transduction
Laboratories), anti-h-catenin (1:1,000 dilution; clone 5H10, Zymed), antiN-cadherin (1:1,000 dilution; clone 3B9, Zymed), anti-vimentin (1:1,000

(1:1,000 dilution; Southern Biotechnology Associates). Detection was done
routinely using a commercial kit (enhanced chemiluminescence-Western
blot, Amersham).
Zymogram analysis. Gelatinase activity in protein extracts from
established MMEC tumor cell lines was monitored as described.5
Orthotopic tumor formation assay. Cells (1  107) were suspended in
200 AL DMEM and injected orthotopically into the mammary fat pads of
syngeneic F1 offspring from FVB-N and C57BL/6J breeders (The Jackson
Laboratory) or immunocompromised CD-1 nude (Crl:CD-1-nuBR) mice
(Charles River Laboratories). When tumors reached f20 mm in diameter,
mice were euthanized and tumor weight(s) and volume(s) were calculated
via caliper (volume = width2  length  0.52).

with regard to myocardial hypertrophy and perinatal lethality (22).
These experiments confirmed that the model system operated as
required to investigate the effect of Bin1 ablation on remodeling
and tumorigenesis in the mammary gland.
To evaluate whether Bin1 loss affected mammary gland
remodeling induced by pregnancy, female mice were set up for
timed pregnancies by monitoring for vaginal plugs. After
parturition, litter sizes were normalized to five pups and nursing
was continued 1 week to ensure full lactation before pups were
removed to induce mammary gland involution. Mammary gland
tissues were isolated for analysis from virgins (control) or at 18.5
days post coitum (dpc), 7.5 days post partum (dpp; full lactation),
10.5 dpp (early involution), 17.5 dpp (late involution), and 27.5 dpp
( full regression). A delay in the kinetics of ductolobular development was apparent at 18.5 dpc, at which time Bin1Dmam mice
showed significantly less glandular remodeling than Bin1+mam
mice (Fig. 2). However, during lactation at 7.5 dpp, this defect
had resolved, such that no deficiencies were apparent in nursing
and pups showed no signs of malnutrition. During glandular
involution, a delay in remodeling again became apparent, such
that ductolobular regression was achieved with somewhat slower
kinetics in Bin1Dmam mice. We concluded that Bin1 was nonessential for formation of a fully functional lactating mammary
gland but that it was needed to optimally support the rapid kinetics
of ductolobular remodeling in the gland during pregnancy and
weaning.
Bin1 attenuation drives progression of ras-dependent
mammary carcinomas. We evaluated Bin1 as a classic suppressor
or negative modifier gene in breast cancer by investigating whether
its deletion was sufficient (a) to increase the incidence of
mammary tumor formation, in the manner of an inactivated
suppressor, or (b) only to increase the progression of mammary
tumors initiated by primary oncogenic lesions, in the manner of an
inactivated negative modifier.
To evaluate Bin1 as a suppressor gene, we compared the effect of
tissue-specific ablation in three cohorts of Bin1+mam and
Bin1Dmam female mice carried out as nonparous animals (virgin),
uniparous animals (one round of pregnancy), or multiparous
animals (seven rounds of pregnancy). After birth, litters were
normalized to five pups, nursed 10 days, and then removed. By
2 years of age, both strains of mice developed mammary gland
tumors with the same low frequency (Table 1). No differences
were seen between uniparous and multiparous groups, which
were combined as parous. Although the tumors that arose in
the cohort of Bin1Dmam mice were relatively more poorly
differentiated, the similarly low incidence observed argued against
the notion that Bin1 functioned as a classic breast tumor
suppressor gene.
To evaluate Bin1 as a negative modifier gene, we compared the
effect of its tissue-specific ablation in tumors initiated by the
carcinogen DMBA, which acts through ras activation (23), a
MMTV-c-myc transgene, or both. We chose these well-established
models of mammary carcinoma based on the evidence that Bin1
can suppress neoplastic transformation of primary cells by
c-myc +ras (3, 4, 19). In the initial trials, Bin1+mam and
Bin1Dmam female mice were treated with DMBA and monitored
for tumor formation. Both cohorts displayed similar rates of
tumor latency, multiplicity, and lung metastasis (Table 1). However,
whereas Bin1+mam mice developed well-differentiated tumors,
characterized by high tubule formation, low mitotic indices, and
limited nuclear pleomorphism, Bin1Dmam mice developed poorly

Results
Targeted deletion of Bin1 delays remodeling and involution
of the mammary gland. To determine whether Bin1 attenuation
could directly affect initiation or progression of breast cancer, we
embarked on an investigation of the consequences of deleting Bin1
in the mammary gland of the mouse. Previous work established that
homozygous deletion causes perinatal lethality (22); therefore, for
this work, we generated a conditional mutant using Cre-lox
technology. The design is presented in Fig. 1 along with results
confirming the desired in vivo operation of the ‘floxed’ allele in the
mammary gland. In the ‘tri-lox’ scheme used, deletion of exon 3
leads to exon 2 to 4 splicing, producing an out-of-frame stop codon
in exon 4 that abolishes protein expression from all alternately
splice isoforms of Bin1 RNA. In one variation of the standard design,
a mutant loxP site incorporating a T!C mutation was included,
such that exon 3 was flanked on its 5¶ side by a WT loxP site and on
its 3¶ side by the mutated loxP site (Fig. 1A). This variation conferred
a selective advantage to Cre-mediated excision of the neo cassette in
vitro, without compromising the subsequent ability of Cre to delete
the floxed target sequence in vivo.4 Chimeric mice generated from
targeted ES cell transfectants were interbred with transgenic mice
to produce strains that included the WT Bin1 allele (+), floxed KO
allele ( flox), and ‘straight’ KO allele (22) along with a breast-specific
wap-cre transgene and, in some experiments, a MMTV-c-myc
transgene. In animals carrying the wap-cre gene, loxP-mediated
recombination in females was induced by parity because the whey
acidic protein (wap) promoter is activated in mammary epithelial
cells during pregnancy. Bin1 is haplosufficient for survival (22), so
the breeding scheme compared mice with +/flox or KO/flox
genotypes to compare the effects of functional ablation. As
expected, mice with a wap-cre;KO/flox genotype exhibited tissuespecific conversion of the floxed allele to the desired ‘floxD’ allele in
genomic DNA isolated from mammary gland from late pregnancy
through weaning (Fig. 1B and C). To simplify nomenclature, in the
text that follows, we refer to mice with a wap-cre;+/flox or wapcre;KO/flox genotype as Bin1+mam or Bin1Dmam mice, respectively, indicating the retention of one functional allele or the loss of
both alleles in the mammary gland. In work to be reported
elsewhere,6 we confirmed that the floxD allele is functionally
inactivated based on its ability to phenocopy a ‘straight’ KO allele

Bin1 Inhibits Breast Tumor Progression

Figure 2. Bin1 ablation delays mammary ductolobular remodeling during pregnancy. At the times indicated, mammary gland tissue sections were prepared and
processed from Bin1+mam and Bin1Dmam mice for histologic analysis.

An interesting feature of the mammary tumor-bearing Bin1Dmam
cohort was that it displayed a coincident elevation in uterine
endometritis and ovarian granulosa cell tumors, implying either
haploinsufficiency or a non–cell autonomous effect of Bin1 loss in
the uterus and ovary. DMBA treatment is known to cause such
lesions in addition to mammary tumors (e.g., ref. 25) but not at
the relatively higher penetrance observed in mice from the
Bin1Dmam cohort. The transcriptional activity of the wap
promoter is restricted to brain and the mammary gland during
the lactational stage of pregnancy (26), and consistent with this
pattern of expression, we did not detect recombination of the
Bin1 floxed allele in the ovary or uterus of Bin1Dmam mice.4

differentiated tumors, characterized by low tubule formation, high
mitotic indices, and high degrees of nuclear pleomorphism
(Table 1). Nuclear pleomorphism was particularly increased by
Bin1 loss (Fig. 3). Additionally, Bin1Dmam mice displayed a
relative increase in lymphocyte infiltration compared with
Bin1+mam mice (57% versus 20% of tumors; A.P.S., data not
shown). In parallel experiments done in a mosaic model, we saw a
similar pattern of development of more poorly differentiated
mammary tumors in Bin1Dmam mosaic mice.4 Together, these
observations suggested that Bin1 functioned as a negative modifier
to restrict the progression of tumors initiated by activation of the
ras pathway.

Bin1+mam mice. Bin1Dmam cell lines grew to higher densities
and displayed a spindle morphology consistent with the more
aggressive features displayed by the tumors from which they were
derived (Fig. 4A). The status of Bin1 in cell lines was confirmed by
PCR and Western blot analysis and the analysis of a representative
pair is presented below (Fig. 4B; data not shown). Western blot
analyses confirmed the expression of E-cadherin and h-catenin,
but not of vimentin, which is expressed strongly in mammary
myoepithelial cells and fibroblasts (Fig. 4C). Immunohistochemical
staining of primary tumors confirmed common expression of
E-cadherin and h-catenin (data not shown), consistent with the
likelihood that the established tumor cell populations are indeed
epithelial in character. N-cadherin was also expressed in these cell
lines; however, because there was no correlation to Bin1 status,
this mesenchymal marker was interpreted as a general feature of
DMBA-induced breast carcinogenesis in the mouse (Fig. 4C).
Bin1Dmam cells displayed a 3–4 times higher rate of in vitro
proliferation under anchorage-dependent conditions (Fig. 4D).
Under conditions of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar
culture, only Bin1Dmam cells displayed detectable colony formation activity in parallel with their more aggressive growth
character (data not shown). Bin1Dmam cells also exhibited
severalfold greater resistance to apoptosis elicited by serum
deprival (Fig. 4E), extending evidence of a proapoptotic role for
Bin1 in neoplastic cells (14–16, 18, 19). Lastly, Bin1Dmam cells
displayed an increased motility in monolayer culture associated
with increased gelatinase activity attributable to activated matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP-9; Fig. 4F and G). Taken together, these
results strengthened the evidence that Bin1 acts in the guise of a
negative modifier in cancer.
We compared the ability of Bin1Dmam and Bin1+mam MMECs
to form orthotopic tumors in syngeneic immunocompetent mice
and immunocompromised nude mice, based on an earlier
demonstration that Bin1 loss could promote immune escape of
myc+ras-transformed keratinocytes (20). Unfortunately, none of
the MMEC populations established from DMBA-induced mammary tumors could form tumors in syngeneic FVB/N  BL/6 F1
female mice, preventing us from exploring this issue further.
In contrast, after orthotopic injection of 107 cells into the fat pads
of immunocompromised female nude mice, Bin1Dmam cells
formed tumors efficiently, whereas Bin1+mam cells formed mainly
indolent nodules up to 5 months after seeding (Fig. 4H). The more
profound in vivo growth differences observed could not be fully
explained by the in vitro differences documented, suggesting
that Bin1 loss may provide an additional undefined benefit in vivo.
Nude mice retain natural killer (NK) cell and some B-cell immune
functions, but we observed a similar pattern of tumor growth in
severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and SCID/beige murine
hosts, which completely lack T/B and T/B/NK cell functions,
respectively (data not shown). In summary, we concluded that
Bin1 acts to limit the progression of DMBA mammary tumors at
several intrinsic levels, including by negatively modifying the
proliferation, survival, and motility of tumor cells.

Nevertheless, there was an increased incidence of DMBA-induced
ovarian granulosa cell tumors in Bin1Dmam mice (43%) relative to
Bin1+mam mice (13%), all of whom also had mammary tumors at
diagnosis (Supplementary Figure S1; Supplementary Table S1). In
the uterus, a similar incidence of cystic hyperplasia was observed
but only the Bin1Dmam cohort displayed endometritis (Supplementary Figure S2; Supplementary Table S1). These observations
corroborated the concept of Bin1 as a negative modifier of lesions
produced by DMBA treatment, due to either haploinsufficiency or
a non–cell autonomous mechanism of action in the ovary and
uterus.
In contrast to the above observations, we found that Bin1
deletion had little effect when tumor formation was initiated by a
c-myc transgene. In female MMTV-c-myc mice carried out under
multiparous conditions to activate transgene expression, mammary adenocarcinomas develop at a frequency approaching 100%
with a latency of 7 to 10 months (27). In multiparous cMyc;Bin1+mam and c-Myc;Bin1Dmam females, we observed the
development of similar moderate to poorly differentiated mammary adenocarcinomas, with similar latencies, high tumor grades,
and robust metastatic propensities (Supplementary Table S2).
These tumors were characterized by large round cells with
histologic evidence of an abundance of infiltrating macrophages
and apoptotic cells (data not shown). When these mice were
treated with DMBA, we observed the development of similar
poorly differentiated mammary carcinomas. However, c-Myc;Bin1Dmam mice also developed aggressive lymphomas that
appeared in some animals before mammary carcinomas had
formed (Supplementary Table S2). As above, this observation
suggested either haploinsufficiency or a cell nonautonomous
modifier effect on DMBA-induced tumors (28) in cooperation
with MMTV-c-myc (the expression of which is leaky in lymphoid
cells). Taken together, these findings argue that the effects of
Bin1 loss were selective insofar as cooperation was only observed
in the absence of c-Myc overexpression (which on its own was
sufficient to drive formation of poorly differentiated high-grade
mammary carcinomas). We concluded that Bin1 loss cooperated
specifically with DMBA-induced ras activation to drive breast
tumor progression.

progression, we compared the behavior of MMECs established
from several DMBA-induced tumors excised from Bin1Dmam and

This study provides evidence that Bin1 functions as a negative
modifier or antiprogression gene during breast tumorigenesis. In
the parous gland, Bin1 was dispensable for function, based on
normal patterns of nursing and development in newborn pups.
However, histologic analysis revealed a requirement for the rapidity

(IDO) in mediating immune escape (20). Unfortunately, we could
not evaluate effects of Bin1 loss on IDO-mediated immune escape
in the DMBA mammary carcinogenesis model because none of the
tumor MMEC populations had the ability to form grafts in
immunocompetent hosts. In any case, other evidence suggests that
in breast cancer, the mechanism of immune escape based on IDO
elevation may be more relevant in the peripheral immune cells in
tumor-draining lymph nodes than in the tumor cells themselves
(31), the latter of which do not tend to overexpress IDO like other
solid tumors (32). Therefore, breast models may not be especially
pathophysiologically germane to evaluate how Bin1 attenuation in
tumor cells affects immune escape. In assessing cell-intrinsic
qualities, differences in the effects of Bin1 on proliferation and

of the kinetics of ductolobular remodeling that occurs during
pregnancy. Given an involvement of the yeast homologues of Bin1
in stress signaling (25, 29), the significance of its role in remodeling
might depend on stresses in the natural environment that could
limit milk production. In DMBA-induced tumors, we observed
effects of Bin1 status on the activity of the MMP-9, which can
contribute to remodeling of the mammary gland during pregnancy
(30). However, because dysregulation of MMP-9 has significantly
more pronounced effects on the normal mammary gland than
that produced by Bin1 loss, we do not favor the interpretation
that the phenotype produced by Bin1 loss relates to MMP-9
dysregulation.
We observed no long-term effects of Bin1 deletion on cancer
incidence in virgin or parous animals, indicating that this gene
does not function as a classic tumor suppressor in the mammary
gland. In contrast, when mammary tumors were initiated by DMBA
in Bin1-deficient mice, we found that high-grade carcinomas
emerged that exhibited increased proliferation, survival, and
motility relative to tumors induced in control mice expressing
Bin1. Interestingly, we noted a coincident increase of ovarian
tumors or lymphomas in Bin1Dmam mice, which reflected either
haploinsufficiency or a non–cell autonomous mechanism of action
in these settings. Although the underlying mechanisms of these
effects were undefined, they provided further corroboration of the
concept of Bin1 as a negative modifier in breast cancer.
In previous work in transformed mouse keratinocyte and
fibroblast models, we observed that Bin1 loss strongly affected
the capacity for immune escape with less effect on proliferation
and survival (19, 20). In particular, in the transformed keratinocyte
model, we had identified a role for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase

Figure 5. Model. Maintaining Myc expression is sufficient to drive cell division
and tumorigenesis, yet in many human cancers, Myc is both deregulated and
overexpressed, implying the existence of a selection for high Myc levels to
provide a progression benefit. The model proposes that acquisition of this
progression benefit can be phenocopied by Bin1 loss in cooperation with ras
activation.

Cancer Research

Drosophila seem to relate vesicle trafficking processes to a facet of
Myc function that drives cell competition in tissues (37). Using the
imaginal disc as a model system, a function for myc in driving
cell competition was defined that could be fully phenocopied by
overexpression of the small GTPase Rab5 (37), a well-characterized
regulator of vesicle trafficking. Specifically, it was shown that highMyc cells and high-Rab cells could compete equally for internalization of limiting growth factors in a tissue (37, 38), surviving at
the cost of low-Myc or low-Rab cells that lost the competition
and perished (37). The genetic complementarity these findings
suggest that the cell competition function of Myc may rely on
trafficking events of the type that involve Rab5 and Bin1 (12), which
biochemically interact through Rin3, a Rab5 guanine nucleotide
exchange factor that binds Bin1 on early endosomes (39). In future
work, the conditional mutant mouse and pathologic footing
developed here will provide a solid foundation to address questions
about the precise mechanism(s) by which Bin1 loss facilitates
tumor progression.
One clinical implication of our findings is that losses of nuclear
Bin1 may predict poor prognosis of breast cancers when c-Myc is
not overexpressed but Ras signaling is deregulated, for example,
due to deregulation of an upstream growth factor receptor.
Although some fraction of breast carcinomas overexpress
c-Myc, signaling poor prognosis (40–44), and immunohistochemical losses of Bin1 that seem to occur more frequently (16, 45)
may be useful in the larger number of cases where c-Myc is
not overexpressed. The findings of this study prompt an examination of Bin1 in retrospective or prospective studies where its
potential usefulness as a progression marker can be further
evaluated (46).

survival in the keratinocyte and fibroblast models may reflect their
in vitro generation, where strong selections for survival and
proliferation are imposed (perhaps defeating the benefits of losing
a negative modifier). In contrast, the findings from the in vivo–
generated breast model reported here corroborate the findings of a
large number of reports showing the ability of Bin1 to limit cell
proliferation and survival (3, 4, 14–19, 33, 34). In this study, we also
observed increased motility and elevated MMP-9 activity in MMEC
tumor cell populations lacking Bin1, a finding that we have since
corroborated in the transformed keratinocyte and fibroblast
models characterized previously.7 Further assessment of the
mechanism of MMP-9 dysregulation as well as the effects of
Bin1 loss on proliferation and survival is currently being
conducted in a mosaic model where direct in vivo evaluations in
other tissues are possible.
It is apparent that the effects of Bin1 loss in the mammary gland
were selective because of the specific cooperation of Bin1 loss in
driving progression with ras activated by DMBA but not c-myc
overexpressed from the MMTV promoter. These data imply that
the functional effects of Bin1 loss and myc overexpression must
overlap to some extent because of the ability of either Bin1 loss or
myc activation to cooperate with ras activation to drive breast
tumor progression (present study; ref. 35). Bin1 loss obviously does
not fully phenocopy myc activation. Thus, along with evidence that
nuclear Bin1 proteins functionally interact with c-Myc protein
(3–5), a logical inference is that Bin1 acts to limit a subset of
myc functions that are selectively important to progression in
cooperation with ras. In this context, it is interesting to note that
although maintaining the expression of myc throughout the cell
cycle is sufficient to prevent cell cycle exit and to drive
tumorigenesis, many human cancers not only deregulate myc
but overexpress it (36). Following the implication that myc
overexpression may benefit tumor progression, our data support
a model where Bin1 loss partly or fully phenocopies such benefits
in cooperation with ras activation (Fig. 5).
In considering models that incorporate a relationship between
these genes, we note that recent genetic studies of myc in
