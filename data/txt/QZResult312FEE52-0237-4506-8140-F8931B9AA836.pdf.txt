ABSTRACT:
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been implicated in tumor growth via
interactions with its receptors (FGFRs) on the cell surface and therefore, bFGF/FGFRs
are considered essential targets for cancer therapy. Herein, a consensus heptapeptide
(LSPPRYP) was identified for the first time from a phage display heptapeptide library
after three sequential rounds of biopanning against FGFR-expressing cells with
competitive displacement of phage by bFGF, followed by subtraction of non-specific
binding by FGFR-deficient cells. Phage bearing LSPPRYP showed high levels of binding
to Balb/c 3T3 cells expressing high-affinity bFGF-binding FGFR (bFGFR), but not to the
cells that do not express bFGFR (Cos-7), or express a very low affinity bFGFR (HaCat).
The selected-phage-derived peptide synthesized by solid phase method using a rapid
and practical Fmoc strategy was found to specifically compete with bFGF for binding
to its receptors, inhibit bFGF-stimulated cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest,
and block bFGF-induced activation of Erk1 and Erk2 kinase in B16-F10 melanoma
cells. Importantly, treatment of melanoma-bearing mice with the synthetic peptide
significantly suppressed tumor growth. The results demonstrate a strong anticancer
activity of the isolated bFGFR-binding peptide (and its future derivatives), which may
have great potential for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Phage display technology has been used to identify
desirable peptides and is an important tool for drug
discovery. We have successfully applied the technique to
identify a high-affinity bFGF-binding peptide with strong
inhibitory activity against bFGF-induced cell proliferation
and angiogenesis [5]. Herein, the goal was to isolate a FGF
receptor (FGFR)-binding peptide with this technique. The
phage display library used consisted of phages bearing
random heptapeptides fused to the N-terminus of the coat
protein pIII of the M13 Phage. Using FGFR-deficient

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays essential
roles in both physiological and pathological processes by
interacting with specific receptors on the cell surface [1,
2]. Because overexpression of bFGF and/or its receptors
is commonly detected in tumors, the development of
antagonists to bFGF and its receptors has been considered
as a potential strategy for cancer therapy [3, 4].

Cos-7 cells as the subtractive cells, three consecutive
rounds of panning with the library against Balb/c 3T3
cells expressing exuberant FGF receptors were performed
to identify a binding peptide sequence (LSPPRYP), by
extrapolating from the corresponding DNA sequences of
5 positive phage clones eluted from the cells by bFGF.
The phage bearing LSPPRYP was evaluated for its cellbinding specificity. Moreover, because bFGF greatly
contributes to melanoma growth and progress [6, 7],
the synthetic peptide consisting of this sequence and a
spacer sequence GGGS was further tested for antitumor
activity using B16-F10 murine melanoma cells for in vitro
experiments, and introduced into C57BL/6 mice for in vivo
experiments. The results demonstrated that the identified
synthetic peptide could reverse the effects of bFGF on cell
proliferation, cell cycle progression, Erk1/Erk2 activation
of melanoma cells, and significantly inhibit tumor growth
in mice.

round of panning, low affinity phages eluted within 1 h
were discarded, and the phages further eluted with bFGF
for an additional 1 h were analyzed by ELISA to identify
high-affinity bFGF receptor-binding clones. Phage clones
that exhibited a binding affinity (i.e, OD value) to Balb/c
3T3 2-fold greater than observed for Cos-7 cells were
considered positive. As shown in Fig. 1, we identified 5
positive clones from a total of 13 phage clones.

Sequence analysis and property prediction of
positive phages
Total DNA of the positive phages was isolated
and sequenced using -96gⅢ primers. The amino acid
sequences of the peptides displayed on the corresponding
phages were deduced from the DNA sequences and
Bioedit and ProtParam programs were applied to analyze
the sequences and predict the peptide properties. As
shown in Table 1, 5 clones shared consensus sequences
(LSPPRYP). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of
the heptapeptide (P9) with that of bFGF revealed that the
P9 contained 6 amino acids identical to the adjacent amino
acids (L3, S9, P13, P14, R120, Y124) of the 3D structure
of bFGF, which are located within the motifs (P13~K18
and R120~K125), which are involved in receptor binding
and mitogenic activity of bFGF. Furthermore, similar to
bFGF, P9 also carried positive charges under physiological
conditions, suggesting that electrostatic interaction might
also be involved in their binding to FGF receptors.

RESULTS
Isolation of phages binding to bFGF receptors
Specific phages capable of binding to bFGF
receptors were selected by three rounds of biopanning
against positive cells expressing high-affinity bFGF
receptors on the cell surface. In order to diminish the
background of screening, bound phages were specifically
eluted with bFGF and subtractive panning was carried
out against cells that were deficient in bFGF receptors.
In the first round, a lower concentration of PBST (0.05%)
was applied to wash for higher eluate titers. In order to
enrich highly specific and affinity phages, nonspecifically
binding phages were absorbed by subtractive cells before
screening, and the concentration of PBST was then
increased to 0.1% from the second round. In the last

Specificity of selected phage clone for binding cells

Specificity of the synthetic peptide for bFGF
binding to its receptors

It has been shown that Balb/c 3T3 cells express
high-affinity bFGF receptors (e.g., FGFR1c and FGFR2c)
on the cell surface, while HaCat cells exclusively express
a specific isoform of FGFR2 (also known as FGFR2b or
KGFR) with a very low affinity to bFGF [8, 9]. To assess
the binding specificity of the selected phage clone, we
compared the ability of the phages to bind Balb/c 3T3,
HaCat and FGFR-deficient Cos-7 cells [10, 11]. As shown
in Figure 2, the affinity of the phage clone LSPPRYP to
Balb/c 3T3 cells was markedly stronger than to HaCaT
and Cos-7 cells. The Kd value for Balb/c 3T3 cells
was between 3.91×109 pfu and 1.56×1010 pfu, which is
approximately 16 times less than the Kd value (between
6.25×1010 pfu and 2.50×1011 pfu) for HaCaT and Cos7 cells (Fig. 2). The results revealed that the LSPPRYP
phage exhibits greater binding to the cells expressing highaffinity bFGF receptors than to the cells with low affinity
bFGF receptors or without bFGF receptors.

In a phage display heptapeptide library, the
C-terminus of the random peptide is fused to the phage
via a short spacer (GGGS), having no free negatively

charged carboxylate. Therefore, a spacer sequence
(GGGS) was added to the C-terminus and the C-terminal
carboxylate was amidated to block the negative charge
when synthesizing the peptide corresponding to the
selected sequence (LSPPRYP). The selected-phagederived peptide was synthesized on solid phase using a
rapid and practical Fmoc strategy. The crude compound
was subjected to RP-HPLC purification. As shown in Fig.
3, high purity grade (98%) was obtained after purification
and the synthetic peptide was characterized for its identity
by mass spectrometry analysis.
To characterize the effect of the synthesized P9
peptides (LSPPRYPGGGS) on bFGF binding to its
receptors, P9 peptides were compared to bFGF for their
ability to compete directly for 125I -bFGF binding on Balb/c
3T3 cells expressing exuberant bFGF receptors. As shown
in Fig. 4, P9 is highly efficient in specific competing for
125
I-bFGF binding to its receptors, in which about 2.5 nM
of P9 was able to displace 50% of 125I-bFGF. Scatchard
analysis of 125I-bFGF binding on Balb/c 3T3 revealed a
receptor population consisting of approximately 9,600

sites/cell with a dissociation constant (KD) of 100 pM.
These affinity and capacity values are within the range
of values previously published for the high affinity bFGF
receptors (KD = 10 - 200 pM, 0.2-10 ×104 sites/cell). In the
presence of P9 peptides, specific high affinity binding of
125
I-bFGF to Balb/c 3T3 cells decreased significantly with
a KD of 500 pM and a receptor population of about 27,000
sites/cell. These results indicate that P9 peptides are able
to block the binding of bFGF to its receptors, and may
have the potential to antagonize bFGF bioactivity.

Effect of the synthetic peptide on bFGFstimulated proliferation of melanoma cells
We next determined the efficacy of the synthetic
P9 peptides in blocking bFGF-stimulated tumor cell
proliferation. B16-F10 murine melanoma cells with high
levels of FGFR expression [12, 13] were incubated with 30
ng/mL bFGF alone or along with various concentrations of
the P9 peptides. As shown in Fig. 5, the synthetic peptides

inhibited B16-F10 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner and nearly 90% of inhibition was achieved at 10
nM.

Pretreatment of B16-Fl0 cells with the synthetic peptides
at a concentration of 10 nM or higher for 5 min prior to
bFGF stimulation completely suppressed bFGF-induced
Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7, lanes 3-6). The
levels of Erk1/Erk2 activation in the cells treated with
bFGF and P9 peptides at a concentration of 10 nM or
higher were significantly lower than those in the cells
treated with bGFG alone, and comparable to the untreated
control B16-Fl0 cells.

Effect of the synthetic peptides on bFGF-induced
cell cycle progression
The effect of the synthetic peptides on cell cycle
progression induced by bFGF was determined by flow
cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, treatment with
bFGF significantly increased the percentage of S phase
cells, and decreased the ratio of G0/G1 phase cells.
In contrast, cells treated with bFGF plus the synthetic
peptides had a higher G0/G1-phase population and lower
S-phase population than those treated with bFGF alone,
suggesting that the synthetic peptides reversed the S-phase
increase induced by bFGF, and arrested the cells at the G0/
G1 phase.

Effect of the synthetic peptides on bFGF-induced
MAP kinase activation
The effect of the synthetic P9 peptide on bFGF
signal transduction was determined by measuring its
capacity to inhibit the activation of two MAPKs (Erk1
and Erk2) in B16-Fl0 cells after stimulation by bFGF.

with PBS (n=10 mice for each group). (B) P9 inhibits Erk1/Erk2

The synthetic peptides suppressed tumor growth
in vivo

DNA synthesizing S-phase [22]. ERK activity plays a
pivotal role in cell proliferation via regulation of cyclin
D1 expression during mid-G1 and driving cells past the
G1-restriction point [23, 24]. In order to explore the
potential of the isolated bFGF receptor-binding peptide
P9 in cancer treatment, we investigated the effects of P9
on bFGF-induced proliferation, cell cycle distribution,
and MAKP signal transduction in B16-F10 cells. Our
results showed that P9 inhibited the proliferation of
B16-F10 cells stimulated by bFGF in a dose-dependent
manner. In accordance with the inhibitory effect of P9
on cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis showed that P9
arrested bFGF-stimulated cells at the G0/G1 phase, and
the MAP kinase activation assay revealed that P9 reduced
the levels of Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation in B16-F10
cells induced by bFGF. Downregulation of Erk1 and
Erk2 activation may contribute to more G0/G1 cells in
P9-treated cells than in the untreated control cells via
restriction of cyclin D1 expression during mid-G1 and
inhibition of cells passing the G1-restriction point. In a
small animal model system, P9 significantly suppressed
tumor growth and blocked Erk1/Erk2 activation in the
tumors. The synthetic peptide attenuates the mitogenic
activity of bFGF possibly via interfering with the
interaction between bFGF and its receptors.
As bFGF/FGFRs have been considered as a target
for cancer therapy, efforts have been made to develop the
antagonists targeting bFGF/FGFRs including antibodies
and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. When
compared to antibodies, small peptides may have several
advantages for therapy. First, the peptides are easy to
synthesize and modify according to their pharmacokinetic
requirements [25]. Second, they are small and easily
penetrate through the tissue [26]. Third and most
importantly, they have low immunogenicity [25, 27].
There are also disadvantages for utilizing small peptides
[27]. One disadvantage is their rapid proteolysis by
endogenous peptidases and proteases. There are several
ways to overcome this obstacle including the usage of
D-amino acids, and substitution of the peptide bonds.
Another disadvantage for small peptides is the loss of
binding affinity when conjugated to other therapeutic
molecules, which could be addressed by keeping the
conjugated molecules apart from the receptor-binding
sequence. Compared to chemical agents such as tyrosine
kinase inhibitors which are not tumor specific and bear the
risk of severe side effects [28], P9 has potential for high
selectivity because it targets interactions between bFGF
and its receptors, and may be safer to use from a clinical
point of view.
In summary, our results demonstrate that the
isolated bFGF receptor-binding peptide P9 provides an
effective bFGF/FGFR antagonist, and may have potential
application for the treatment of proliferative disorders,
including a variety of cancers with upregulation of bFGF/
FGFRs.

We further investigated the in vivo antitumor
efficacy of the synthetic peptides in a mouse model of
melanoma. Tumor was established by subcutaneously
implanting the C57BL/6-derived B16-Fl0 cells into
C57BL/6 mice. The synthetic peptides were administrated
at dose of 0.5 mg/kg or 2.5 mg/kg on alternate days
starting at day 7, and the growth of the tumors was
assessed for 9 days. Treatment with the synthetic peptides
resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume
compared to that observed as a result of PBS treatment
(P<0.01 vs PBS group). A dose-dependent inhibition of
tumor growth of 38% and 82% was observed on day 9 for
animals treated with the synthetic peptides at a dose of
0.5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively (Fig. 8A). All mice
were sacrificed at day 9, one day after the last injection
of the P9 peptides (16 days after tumor injection, and 9
days after first administration of the synthetic peptides).
Immunostaining with anti-phospho-Erk1/Erk2 (pErk1/
pErk2) antibody showed a dose-dependent inhibition
of Erk1/Erk2 activation. The numbers of pErk1/pErk2positive cells were markedly reduced in tumors from mice
treated with P9 peptides compared to tumors in control
animals (Fig. 8B). The data showed a potent inhibitory
effect of the P9 peptides on tumor growth in vivo, which
was associated with significant inhibition of Erk1/Erk2
activation in tumor cells.

DISCUSSION
Phage display technology provides an efficient tool
to identify the desirable sequences binding specifically to
targets, and is widely used in diagnostic and therapeutic
protein developments in recent years [14-16]. FGFRs
have been shown to act as driving oncogene in certain
cancers to maintain the malignant properties of tumor
cells via a cell autonomous manner [17]. In this study
herein, we developed a biopanning strategy using phage
display technology for identifying bFGF receptor-binding
peptides. The selected phage clone exhibits a remarkable
binding affinity to Balb/c 3T3 cells that express highaffinity bFGF receptors, while binding poorly to cells
that do not express bFGF receptors (Cos-7), or express
low affinity bFGF receptors. Furthermore, the identified
peptide specifically competed for bFGF binding to its
receptors, and was able to inhibit bFGF-stimulated cancer
proliferation in vitro and suppress tumor growth in vivo.
There is a growing body of evidence that bFGF
promotes cancer cell proliferation through the activation
of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway [18-21]. Cell
proliferation is regulated during the G0/G1 phase in
the cell cycle. CDK4 and CDK6 interacting with the
cyclin D family of proteins drive G0/G1 phase into the

Balb/c 3T3 cells and Cos-7 cells (negative control)
were plated at a density of 1 x 104 cells per well in a 96well plate and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. After
the plates were blocked with PBS-2% dry milk (PBSM) at
37°C for 1 h and washed 3 times with 0.05% PBST, phage
clones (~1010 pfu/well) serially diluted 4 times were added

incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature for
1 h. After 3 washes with 0.05 % PBST, 50 µl of freshlymade 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution was
added to each well and kept at room temperature in the
dark for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 50
µl of 2 M H2SO4 to each well. Absorbance was measured

Evaluation of cell-binding specificity of selected
phage clone

Biopanning of a heptapeptide phage display
library

Balb/c 3T3, HaCaT and Cos-7 were grown to
confluence in 96-well plates. After the plates were
blocked with PBSM at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h and washed
3 times with 0.05% PBST, phage clones (~1012 pfu/well)
serially diluted 4 times were added and incubated at room
temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation. PBS was used
as the blank control. The cells were washed briefly with
PBST before incubation with HRP-anti-M13 mAb (1:
5000) at room temperature for 1 h. After 3 washes with
PBST, freshly-made TMB solution was added to react at
room temperature in the dark for 20 min. The reaction
was terminated and the absorbance was measured in the
manner as described earlier.

Balb/c 3T3 cells grown to 90 % confluence in 25
cm2 tissue culture flask were washed 2 times and blocked
with DMEM-2% dry milk for 2 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. After
the cells were washed 5 times with 0.05% Tween-20
in PBS (0.05% PBST), the heptapeptide phage library
containing 2 × 1011 pfu diluted in 2 ml DMEM was added
and agitated gently at room temperature for 1 h. The cellbound phages were washed 10 times with 0.05 % PBST,
then eluted with 555 nM bFGF with gentle agitation at
room temperature for 2 h. The eluate was then amplified,
purified and titered for the second round of panning. The
phages containing 2 × 1011 pfu obtained from the first
round of panning were diluted in 2 ml DMEM-2% dry
milk, added to 25 cm2 flask with a 90 % confluency of
Cos-7 cells, and agitated gently at room temperature for
1 h. The supernatant was collected and added to the flask
cultured with Balb/c 3T3 cells. Steps were repeated similar
to the first round of panning except that the concentration
of Tween-20 in PBS used for washing was increased from
0.05% to 0.1%. For the last round of selection, low affinity
cell-bound phages were first eluted with bFGF for 1 h,
discarded, and high-affinity cell-bound phages were then
eluted with bFGF for an additional 1 h. The phage clones
obtained from the eluate were subsequently subjected to
ELISA analysis.

DNA sequencing and peptide synthesis
DNA sequences of the positive phage clones
were determined using an automated DNA sequencer at
Invitrogen Company (Shanghai, China), and analyzed
with Bioedit and ProtParam programs (http://au.expasy.
org/tools/protparam.html).
In order to mimic the structure of peptide displayed
on the phage, a spacer sequence Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser was
added to the C-terminus, and the C- terminal carboxylate
was amidated for blocking the negative charge when
the peptide corresponding to the selected sequence was
synthesized on a Liberty Microwave Peptide Synthesizer
(CEM Corp., Matthews, NC) by solid phase method
following the Fmoc chemistry protocols. Briefly, the first
amino acid derivative Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH was loaded
on the amide resin, and the peptide chain was elongated

Receptor binding assay

Starved cells were pretreated with serially-diluted
peptides for 5 min before 20 min of stimulation with
bFGF (30 ng/ml). Cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE loading
buffer after being washed with cold PBS. Cell lysates were
separated by 10% SDS–PAGE, then transferred to PVDF
membranes, and immunoblotted, respectively, with antipErk1/pErk2 mAb and anti-Erk1/Erk2 mAb followed by a
goat anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody. The blots were
visualized with the ECL detection system.

Cells were starved for 24 h, and treated with 30

peptides for 48 h. After fixing in 70% ice-cold ethanol for
30 min at 4 °C and washing with PBS for 3 times, cells
were stained with propidium iodide (PI) in the dark at
room temperature for 30 min. The ModFit DNA analysis
program was applied to analyze the percentages of cells at
various phases of the cell cycle.

MAP kinase activation assay

The recombinant bFGF was iodinated by the
modified chloramine-T method. Briefly, bFGF (5 μg/50
μ1 in 0.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was incubated
with chloramine-T (20 μg/10 μ1 of phosphate buffer) and
125
I-labeled sodium (1.12 mCi/10 μ1) at room temperature
for 55 sec. The reaction was immediately terminated by
the addition of sodium metabisulflte (250 μg/200 μl) and
1% potassium iodide (100 μl), and the mixture was applied
to a Sephadex G-50 column (1×20 cm) preequilibrated in
50 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.1% BSA to separate
125
I-labeled bFGF from free 125I.
Confluent Balb/c 3T3 cells (0.5×106/well) were
incubated with binding buffer (DMEM, 20mM HEPES,
pH7.4) containing 125I-bFGF (50000 cpm) and different
concentrations of unlabeled ligand (bFGF or the synthetic
peptide) for 2.5 h at 4oC. For nonspecific binding, cells
were incubated with 125I-bFGF (50000 cpm) and an excess
of unlabeled bFGF (200 nM). The cells were washed
with (3 × 1 ml) cold PBS (50 mM, PH7.4), and lysed
with 1% Triton X-100 (500 μl). The radioactivity of the
extracts was measured in a γ counter. Specific binding was
determined as the difference between total and nonspecific
binding, and data were analyzed by Scatchard analysis.

In vivo antitumor studies
B16-F10 murine melanoma cells were harvested,
and injected subcutaneously into the flanks (5 × 105
cells) of 7-week old female C57BL/6 mice. When tumors
were visible on all mice on day 7, treated mice were
intraperitoneally injected with the synthetic peptides on
alternate days for a total of 5 injections at a dosage of
0.5, or 2.5 mg/kg, whereas control mice were injected with
PBS. The tumor volumes were determined by measuring
length (l) and width (w) and calculating volume (V =
lw2/2) as described elsewhere [29]. On the next day after
the last injection, mice were sacrificed and the tumors were
extracted and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and
embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections cut from the paraffin
blocks were deparaffinized and processed to microwave
antigen retrieval before being subjected to stain with
a monoclonal rabbit anti-phospho-Erk1/2 at a dilution
of 1: 200 overnight at 4°C. Meanwhile, tissue sections
incubated with PBS instead of monoclonal anti-phosphoErk1/2 were used as the negative control. Visualization
of the antigen-antibody reaction was performed using
an UltraSensitiveTM S-P (Rabbit) kit according to the
manufacturer’s suggestions.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 x 103 cells/
well) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After incubation
at 37°C for 24 h, the culture medium was replaced
by DMEM containing 0.4% FBS to starve the cells
for 24 h. The medium was then replaced by DMEM
containing 30 ng/ml bFGF, or 30 ng/mL bFGF plus
peptide at various concentrations. After culturing for
48 h, the number of viable cells was determined by the
methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) method as previously
described [5].
