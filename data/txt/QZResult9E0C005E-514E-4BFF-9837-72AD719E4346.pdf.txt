ABSTRACT:
The autophagic process, which can facilitate breast cancer resistance to
endocrine, cytotoxic, and molecularly targeted agents, is mainly regulated at the posttranslational level. Although recent studies have suggested a possible transcriptome
regulation of the autophagic genes, little is known about either the analysis tools that
can be applied or the functional importance of putative candidate genes emerging
from autophagy-dedicated transcriptome studies. In this context, we evaluated
whether the constitutive activation of the autophagy machinery, as revealed by a
transcriptome analysis using an autophagy-focused polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
array, might allow for the identification of novel autophagy-specific biomarkers for
intrinsic (primary) resistance to HER2-targeted therapies. Quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR)-based profiling of 84 genes involved in autophagy revealed that, when
compared to trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3 cells, the positive regulator of autophagic
vesicle formation ATG12 (autophagy-related gene 12) was the most differentially upregulated gene in JIMT1 cells, a model of intrinsic cross-resistance to trastuzumab
and other HER1/2-targeting drugs. An analysis of the transcriptional status of ATG12
in > 50 breast cancer cell lines suggested that the ATG12 transcript is commonly
upregulated in trastuzumab-unresponsive HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.
A lentiviral-delivered small hairpin RNA stable knockdown of the ATG12 gene fully
suppressed the refractoriness of JIMT1 cells to trastuzumab, erlotinib, gefitinib, and
lapatinib in vitro. ATG12 silencing significantly reduced JIMT1 tumor growth induced
by subcutaneous injection in nude mice. Remarkably, the outgrowth of trastuzumabunresponsive tumors was prevented completely when trastuzumab treatment was
administered in an ATG12-silenced genetic background. We demonstrate for the first
time the usefulness of low-density, autophagy-dedicated qRT-PCR-based platforms
for monitoring primary resistance to HER2-targeted therapies by transcriptionally
screening the autophagy interactome. The degree of predictive accuracy warrants
further investigation in the clinical situation.

INTRODUCTION

to occur in response to extreme autophagic degradation
triggered upon exposure to several cancer therapies [4547], but it is not an obligatory outcome of trastuzumabactivated autophagy in a trastuzumab-responsive model
of HER2 gene-amplified breast carcinoma cells. Our
studies additionally confirmed that the hyperactivation of
basal autophagy was causally related to the acquisition
of secondary resistance to trastuzumab [27]. Thus,
“protective autophagy” causally enabled HER2 geneamplified breast carcinoma cells to optimally grow for
several months in the presence of clinically relevant
concentrations of trastuzumab. The exploration of the
cytoprotective effects of autophagy in breast cancer cells
subjected to the pharmacologically mediated depletion
of growth factor receptor signaling by mono-HER1 (i.e.,
gefitinib, cetuximab), mono-HER2 (i.e., trastuzumab), and
dual HER1/HER2 (i.e., lapatinib) inhibitors has confirmed
that enhanced autophagic activity can contribute to more
efficient maintenance of cancer cell resistance to HER
targeting drugs [48-51]. However, a crucial aspect of this
process that has remained unexplored is the possibility
that HER2 gene-amplified breast carcinoma cells might
also exploit the cytoprotective role of autophagy to escape
from HER2-targeted therapies ab initio.
It is well recognized that the autophagic process is
mainly regulated at the post-translational level. However,
a growing body of evidence has started to suggest that
autophagy might also be regulated at the transcriptional
level. We now have several methods and tools for the
analysis of the autophagic flux and post-translational
modifications of autophagy proteins [52]. Unfortunately,
little is known about the analysis tools that can be applied
to explore changes in the expression of autophagy genes
or about the functional importance of putative candidate
genes emerging from autophagy-dedicated transcriptome
studies. In this context, we first assessed the utility of an
autophagy-focused polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array
to identify novel autophagy-specific gene biomarkers for
intrinsic (primary) resistance to trastuzumab in HER2
gene-amplified breast cancer cells that naturally exhibit
bona fide primary resistance to HER-targeted therapies
[12, 13, 17, 53-55]. Second, using molecular biology
approaches we unambiguously validated whether the
autophagy genes differentially expressed in trastuzumabrefractory breast carcinoma cells functionally predicted the
primary response to the growth-inhibitory and anti-tumoral
effects of trastuzumab. When employing pre-clinical
models of trastuzumab-refractory HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cultures and xenografts, we were able to
confirm that the transcriptional screening of the autophagy
interactome can accurately identify autophagic pathway
genes that operate as a primary mechanism of trastuzumab
resistance in breast carcinoma cells.

Although molecular drugs that specifically target
one or several members of the HER signaling network
can affect the expression and/or activation status of the
HER2 oncoprotein, accumulating evidence suggests that
the actual repercussions of HER2-targeting drugs (e.g.,
the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab or the
dual HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib) for
tumor growth inhibition are closely related to the ability
of these drugs to efficiently impede specific signaling
pathways downstream of HER2 [1-8]. The identification
of these pathways and whether they are operative before,
during, and/or after treatment with HER2-inhibiting drugs
might enable individual therapeutic decisions to be based
on tumor biology rather than on basic histopathological
data alone [9-23]. Autophagy (from the Greek autos, itself,
and phagein, to eat) is a constitutive catabolic pathway
that mediates both non-specific and targeted sequestration
of cellular organelles and other macromolecules, which
permits the degradation of cellular components in
lysosomes and the recycling of bioenergetic metabolites
[24-26]. The activation of autophagy might constitute a
molecular mechanism that, beyond HER2 expression
status in breast carcinoma cells, may accurately reflect the
reliance of HER2 gene-amplified breast carcinomas on
HER2-driven signaling [27-29].
Previous studies have linked autophagy to both
tumor-suppressive (i.e., autophagy defects that predispose
individuals to tumor development) and tumor-promoting
functions (i.e., autophagy activation promotes survival
under stress, including cytotoxic chemotherapy) [3035]. Of note, HER2 signaling and responsiveness
to trastuzumab appear to dynamically interact with
both the tumor-suppressive and tumorigenic roles of
autophagy. The loss of ATG6/Beclin1, one of the earliest
characterized mammalian autophagy genes that suggested
a tumor suppression function for autophagy in certain
mouse models of mammary oncogenesis [36-39], has
been suggested to contribute to HER2 gene amplification
as well as to alterations in PI3K and PTEN, two crucial
downstream effectors of HER2 [40]. Because the main
predictors of trastuzumab activity in both pre-clinical
and clinical settings are HER2 gene amplification and
activation of the PI3K pathway, defined as PTEN loss
and/or PIK3CA mutation [41-44], the loss of ATG6/
Beclin1 might function as a positive predictor of the tumor
response to HER2-targeted therapies. Defective autophagy
can therefore lead to enhanced cell death of HER2-positive
cancer cells bearing competent apoptosis or senescence
pathways upon challenge with HER2 inhibiting drugs [28].
However, we have added trastuzumab to the growing list
of molecularly targeted therapeutics that activate the prosurvival function of autophagy as part of their mechanism
of action [27]. Autophagic cell death, also referred to
as active cell death II [APDC II], has been suggested

HER2 gene-amplified cell line established from a ductal
carcinoma pleural metastasis of a 62-year-old patient who
did not respond to trastuzumab treatment ab initio [53-55],
were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
to evaluate the expression of 84 key genes involved in
autophagy (Fig. 1). When we imposed a two-fold change
in mRNA expression level as the cut-off requirement to
determine significant regulatory effects on autophagyrelated genes, the autophagy suppressor BAK1 (BCL2antagonist/killer 1; ↓3-fold), the chaperone HSP90AA1
(Heat Shock Protein 90 kDa alpha [cytosolic], class A
member 1; ↓6-fold), the mTOR-related negative regulator
of autophagy AKT1 (↓6-fold), and the endosomal/
lysosomal membrane protein-coding gene CLN3 (CeroidLipofuscinosis, Neuronal 3; ↓6-fold) were identified as
down-regulated in trastuzumab-unresponsive JIMT1
cells compared to trastuzumab-responsive SKBR3 cells.
The metabolic master rheostat protein PRKAA2 (AMP-

activated Protein Kinase catalytic subunit alpha-2; ↑3fold), the retinoblastoma-related senescence/autophagy
marker CDKN2A/p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
2; ↑3-fold), the autophagy stimulator DAPK1 (DeathAssociated Protein Kinase 1; ↑6-fold), the multifunctional
cytokine TGFβ1 (Transforming Growth Factor-β1;
13-fold), and the essential autophagy gene ATG12
(Autophagy-related 12 homolog (S. cerevisiae); ↑11-fold)
were significantly up-regulated in trastuzumab-refractory
JIMT1 cells. Trastuzumab exposure, while incapable
of influencing the proliferation of JIMT1 cells, slightly
enhanced the differential overexpression of the autophagyrelated genes PRKAA2, CDKN2A/p16, DAPK1 and ATG12
(Fig. 1).
ATG12 is differentially up-regulated in HER2 geneamplified breast carcinoma cells that exhibit primary

differential overexpression of the ATG12 gene might
correlate with breast cancer cell phenotypes of primary
(inherent) resistance to trastuzumab, we took advantage
of the ROCK online interface, a publicly accessible
portal that enables the rapid integration of breast cancer
functional and molecular profiling datasets [58]. We
analyzed the transcriptional profile of the ATG12 gene
across the Adai (GSE1090) gene expression dataset, which
includes 56 breast cancer cell lines, and across the Neve’s
gene expression data set, which includes 54 widely used
breast cancer cell lines [59]. The HER2-positive breast
cancer cell lines were classified as trastuzumab-sensitive
or trastuzumab-refractory based on the data from the
literature. We then compared the normalized expression
data for ATG12 among trastuzumab-sensitive (blue dots
in Fig. 2) and trastuzumab-refractory (red dots in Fig.
2) cell lines. When the expression status of ATG12 was
interrogated in the Adai data set, an increasing trend in
mean ATG12 mRNA expression values was observed in
the trastuzumab-refractory group, which proved to be
almost statistically significant (P = 0.051; Fig. 2). This
trend reached statistical significance when analyzing
the differences in ATG12 gene expression between the
trastuzumab-refractory and the trastuzumab-sensitive
groups in the Neve’s data set (P=0.010; Fig. 2).
Small hairpin RNA-driven stable knockdown
of ATG12 sensitizes JIMT1 cells to trastuzumab and
eliminates cross-resistance to HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase
inhibitors in vitro. To molecularly establish a causal role
of ATG12-driven autophagy in the de novo resistance of
HER2 gene-amplified breast cancer cells to trastuzumab,
we employed a lentivirus-mediated stable knockdown of
the ATG12 gene. To control for any off-target effects of
short hairpin (sh)RNA transduction, control (negative)
lentiviral particles were also used strictly in parallel.
First, we determined if the expression of ATG12 was
significantly silenced in JIMT1 cells that were stably
transduced with ATG12-shRNAs. Lysates were produced
from JIMT1 cell cultures stably expressing shRNAs that
were designed to recognize and reduce the expression of
ATG12 as well as from JIMT1 cells stably transduced
with an empty vector (control shRNA). Immunoblotting
analyses confirmed that ATG12 protein expression was
reduced to almost undetectable levels (>95% reduction) in
JIMT1 cells that were lentivirally transduced with ATG12
shRNAs compared to parental cells transduced with empty
vector (see Ref. 60). All subsequent experiments were
performed with these stable cell lines, which were termed
control-shRNA/JIMT1 and ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1.
MTT-based cell viability assays were performed to
evaluate the ability to reduce cell growth in JIMT1 cells
before and after the stable knockdown of ATG12. Nontransduced JIMT1 parental cells, control-shRNA/JIMT1
cells, and ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1 cells were treated with
various concentrations of trastuzumab for five days. We
failed to obtain half-maximal inhibitory concentrations

(IC50) in both the parental and control-shRNA/JIMT1
cells, thus confirming the robust resistance of JIMT1
cells to trastuzumab-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 3).
ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1 cells, however, demonstrated
a significantly enhanced sensitivity to trastuzumab at
concentrations as low as 1 µg/mL. Thus, the insignificant
levels of cell viability loss induced by trastuzumab in both
the parental and control-shRNA/JIMT1 cells (i.e., 1%
reduction at 1 µg/mL trastuzumab and 8% reduction at
100 µg/mL trastuzumab, respectively) were augmented
by up to 25-fold (i.e., from 25% reduction at 1 µg/mL
trastuzumab to 33% reduction at 100 µg/mL trastuzumab,
respectively) in ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1 cells (Fig. 3).
Because we recently demonstrated that the IC50
values for the small molecule HER1/HER2 TKIs gefitinib,
erlotinib, and lapatinib were drastically higher (up to
40-fold) in trastuzumab-refractory JIMT1 cells than in
trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3 cells [17], we sought to
evaluate whether the specific knockdown of ATG12 was
sufficient to eliminate the inherent cross-resistance of
JIMT1 cells to HER targeting drugs. Remarkably, the
IC50 values for gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib were
drastically reduced as a result of ATG12 gene silencing
(Fig. 4). The gefitinib IC50 value decreased from 8.0±1.5
µmol/L and 7.8±1 µmol/L in parental and control-shRNA/
JIMT1 cells, respectively, to 1.85±0.7 µmol/L in ATG12shRNA/JIMT1 cells (i.e., ≈4-fold decrease). The erlotinib
IC50 value decreased from 5.0±1.0 µmol/L and 4.5±1.0
µmol/L in parental and control-shRNA/JIMT1 cells,
respectively, to 0.5±0.2 µmol/L in ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1
cells (i.e., ≈10-fold decrease). The lapatinib IC50 value
decreased from 7.0±1.0 µmol/L and 7.5±1.0 µmol/L in
parental and control-shRNA/JIMT1 cells, respectively, to
0.7±0.4 µmol/L in ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1 cells (i.e., ≈10fold decrease). Of note, the sensitizing effect of ATG12
knockdown was restricted to HER targeting drugs because
the growth inhibitory responses of ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1
cells to various cytotoxic molecules (i.e., doxorubicin,
5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, vinorelbine, and paclitaxel)
remained unaltered (data not shown).
ATG12 knockdown reduces tumor growth
and sensitizes trastuzumab-resistant xenografts to
trastuzumab. The effects of the specific ATG12 gene
knockdown on tumor growth were investigated in vivo
in a JIMT1 xenograft animal model (Fig. 4). Compared
to the untreated control group (2266±228 mm3), nine
weeks of treatment with trastuzumab (5 mg/kg/week)
failed to prevent tumor growth by the parental JIMT1
cells; the mean tumor size reached volumes as large as
1556±298 mm3 in the presence of trastuzumab. However,
compared to the mean xenograft tumor size in both the
shRNA-control and trastuzumab-treated groups, the
mean tumor size of the ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1 cells was
smaller (858±121 mm3). Remarkably, when the ATG12shRNA/JIMT1 xenografts were treated with trastuzumab
weekly, the mean tumor size was drastically reduced to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

46±21 mm3, thus demonstrating that the sensitivity of
trastuzumab-refractory JIMT1 xenografts to trastuzumab
increased dramatically when the cells were depleted of the
autophagy driver ATG12. Whereas trastuzumab treatment
reduced the tumor volume of ATG12-expressing JIMT1
xenografts 63 days post-injection by approximately 30%,

ATG12-silenced JIMT1 xenografts by an impressive 98%
over the same treatment time (Fig. 5).

trastuzumab in HER2 gene-amplified breast carcinoma
cells [27, 28]. However, whether HER2-positive breast
cancer cells might also exploit the cytoprotective role of
autophagy to escape from HER2-targeted therapies ab
initio was unexplored. Taking advantage of the HER2
gene-amplified JIMT1 cell line [17, 53-55], which
inherently exhibits cross-resistance to multiple HER1/2
inhibiting drugs, we have provided evidence for the first
time that one of the ubiquitin-like conjugation systems
that is requisite for the formation of autophagic vesicles
(i.e., ATG12) [61-66] is a novel determinant of primary
resistance to HER1/2-targeted therapeutics.
In this study, we first analyzed the correlation
between primary resistance to trastuzumab and the
expression status of several genes that regulate distinct
molecular events leading to autophagic vesicle formation
[61-63, 67-70], including its initiation (e.g., beclin1) and
maturation by the ATG12 (e.g., ATG12 and ATG5) and
LC3 (e.g., ATG4B) conjugation systems. We demonstrated
that DAPK1, TGFB1, and ATG12 are the three proautophagic genes with the highest differential up-

DISCUSSION
We have previously reported that HER2overexpressing breast cancer cells that have been
chronically exposed to the anti-HER2 monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab exhibit a bona fide up-regulation
of the basal autophagic activity that efficiently operates
to protect breast cancer cells from the growth-inhibitory
effects of trastuzumab [27]. Our working model
proposed that enhanced autophagosome formation and
the subsequent catabolic function of autophagy flux
actively contribute to the survival of HER2-dependent
breast cancer and facilitate the rapid development of
resistance to trastuzumab in cells that initially respond to
treatment. Consequently, the blockade of the autophagic
machinery should significantly help to prevent or retard
the appearance of acquired (secondary) resistance to

regulation (>5-fold) between trastuzumab-unresponsive
JIMT1 cells and trastuzumab-sensitive SKBR3 cells.
The death-associated protein kinase-1 (DAPK1)
induces autophagy and apoptosis through independent
mechanisms [71, 72]. Autophagy induced by DAPK1 overexpression can be attenuated by knocking down
expression of the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B
[72], suggesting that the interaction of DAPK-1 with
MAP1B, which in turn is capable of interacting with LC3,
might be responsible for the DAPK-1-driven induction of
autophagy. The extremely pleiotropic behavior of DAPK-1
[73] also suggests that transcriptional programs influenced
by DAPK-1 might also impact the propensity of cells to
undergo autophagy. TGFβ, the best-characterized inducer
of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), has
been shown to induce the accumulation of autophagosomes
and the autophagic conversion of LC3 while enhancing the
degradation of long-lived proteins [74, 75]. TGFβ-induced
autophagy appears to contribute to the growth inhibitory
and tumor suppressive effects of TGFβ, in conjunction
with other anti-proliferative pathways downstream of
TGFβ signaling. Of note, DAPK-1 is commonly silenced
in human cancers by methylation [73] and has tumor and
metastasis suppressor properties. DAPK-1- and TGFβdriven autophagy, therefore, can be viewed as dual-model
paradigms in which autophagy may contribute to tumor
suppression early in the development of a subset of HER2
gene-amplified breast carcinomas; however, when these
tumors somehow bypass the tumor suppressor activity
of DAPK-1 and TGFβ, autophagy would later allow the
selection of invasive, mesenchymal cells with an enhanced
expression of autophagic and stem cell markers. In breast
cancer, the undifferentiated CD44+CD24-/low antigenic state
commonly attributed to breast cancer subpopulations with
cancer stem cell (CSC) properties is highly enriched with
EMT transcriptional factors and mesenchymal markers
[76-82]. Of note, our group has recently confirmed that
a) CD44+CD24-/low mesenchymal subpopulations are
intrinsically unresponsive to trastuzumab [83]; b) the
absence or presence of the CD44+CD24-/low mesenchymal
immunophenotype is closely related to the inherent
sensitivity or refractoriness of HER2-gene amplified
breast carcinoma cells to trastuzumab [83], respectively;
and c) the impairment of the autophagic flux by genetic
means (i.e., ATG12 gene silencing) drastically decreases
the number of trastuzumab-unresponsive cells bearing
CD44+CD24-/low cell surface antigens and appears
to impede the ontogeny of generating the CSC-like
CD44+CD24-/low mesenchymal phenotype by preventing
the full acquisition of a post-EMT status [60]. These
findings, together with our current description that a)
ATG12 overexpression is a new molecular biomarker
for primary resistance to trastuzumab and b) inherent
unresponsiveness to trastuzumab can be switched to
sensitivity simply by depleting ATG12 notably delineates
a new scenario in which primary resistance to HER2www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

targeted drugs can be understood in terms of HER2 geneamplified breast carcinoma cells that are intrinsically
capable of generating highly autophagic, undifferentiated
CD44+CD24-/low antigenic states. Importantly, when
investigating the relationship between the biological roles
of autophagy in trastuzumab-mediated cancer therapy,
we concluded that ATG12-related autophagic flux
specifically functions as a protective cellular phenotype
against HER-targeting drugs. Whereas the IC50 values
for the small-molecule HER1/2 TKIs erlotinib, gefitinib,
and lapatinib were drastically reduced by up to 10-fold
in response to ATG12 gene silencing, the knockdown of
ATG12 failed to alter the sensitivity of JIMT1 cells to
multiple cytotoxics, including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil,
cisplatin, vinorelbine, and paclitaxel (data not shown).
Autophagy addiction underlying the primary resistance
of HER2 gene-amplified breast cancer cells to HER1/2
targeting therapies may depend, at least in part, on the
previously unrecognized ability of autophagy to regulate
a trastuzumab-unresponsive CD44+CD24-/low mesenchymal
cellular state.
Autophagy-addicted, trastuzumab-unresponsive
JIMT1 cells significantly upregulated the expression of
PRKAA2, the catalytic subunit of the master regulator of
cellular energy homeostasis AMPK [84-86]. Cancer cells
are largely unable to change their metabolic programming
as a result of their oncogenic alterations [87-91], which
may underlie the sensitivity of HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells to growth factor receptor inhibitors,
including trastuzumab and lapatinib. Indeed, the
lapatinib-induced activation of AMPK and the consequent
inhibitory effects on protein synthesis and de novo fatty
acid biogenesis are lethal to HER2 gene-amplified breast
carcinoma cells that are “addicted” to glycolysis [92, 93].
Lapatinib treatment seems to deprive cells of energy not
only via the down-regulation of glycolysis but also by
further triggering an entire cascade of metabolic events
mediated by the activation of AMPK. AMPK activation
ultimately results in downstream events that conserve
cellular energy by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis while
activating fatty acid oxidation as an alternative source of
energy. Intriguingly, the ability of AMPK to coordinate
the adaptive response of cellular bioenergetics to ATP
depletion may also be responsible, at least in part, for the
reduced sensitivity of HER2 gene-amplified breast cancer
cells to HER-targeting drugs. Given that AMPK modulates
the activity of crucial regulators of autophagy such as
mTOR, increased expression of AMPK accompanied
by the downregulation of key negative regulators of
mTOR (i.e., AKT1) may aid trastuzumab-refractory
breast cancer cells in mounting a protective autophagic
response from a molecular perspective. The chronic
elevation of AMPK and mTOR activities likely results in
a shift toward catabolism, which can inherently prepare
HER2-overexpressing cells to accommodate the acute
bioenergetic crisis imposed by HER-targeting drugs. This

AMPK-related metabolic scenario is likely associated
with the occurrence of autophagic, trastuzumab-refractory
CD44+CD24-/low mesenchymal immunophenotypes
because treatment with metformin, a partial inhibitor
of autophagy due its limited ability to strongly reduce
intracellular ATP [94-96], is sufficient to efficiently kill
EMT-related CD44+CD24-/low cells and restore trastuzumab
efficacy in HER2 gene-amplified breast cancer cells with
primary resistance to HER1/2-targeting therapies [18, 97101].
A priori autophagic flux is a crucial feature that
determines the efficacy of HER2-directed drugs ab
initio. Targeting autophagy addiction may be helpful in
circumventing the primary resistance to HER2 targeting
therapies and may potentiate the efficacy of HER2
targeting strategies currently in use in HER2-positive
breast cancer patients. While ATG12 is not currently a
druggable target, emerging autophagy inhibitors (e.g.,
Lys05, Spautin-1) that target other components of the
autophagic vesicle assembly [102-104] may prove to be
an effective means to circumvent primary resistance to
and potentiate the efficacy of HER2-targeting strategies
currently in use in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.
All human clinical trials currently exploring autophagy
inhibition as a therapeutic strategy employ chloroquine or
its derivative hydroxychloroquine due to the long track
record of safety in human patients [105-107]. However,
recent studies suggest that hydroxychloroquine is not a
potent autophagy inhibitor at clinically tolerable doses
and that chloroquine-mediated lysosomal dysfunction
sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy independent
of autophagy [108]. Despite this unfavorable scenario,
we are currently exploring whether chloroquine-induced
inhibition of the final step in the autophagic pathway
sensitizes autophagy-addicted [109], trastuzumabrefractory HER2-positive breast cancer cells to the growth
inhibitory activity of trastuzumab. Preliminary evidence
appears to support a valuable pre-clinical scenario
in which lysosomotropic autophagy inhibitors (e.g.,
chloroquine and its derivatives) [105] could prove to be
more effective and autophagy-specific when combined
with molecularly targeted drugs (e.g., trastuzumab) whose
mechanisms of action involve HER2 internalization and
recycling [110-113] via chloroquine-targeted lysosomal
pathway-dependent degradation.
Using very simple bioinformatics tools on wellestablished cell-based breast carcinoma models, we
demonstrated for the first time the usefulness of lowdensity, autophagy-dedicated qRT-PCR-based platforms
for monitoring primary trastuzumab resistance by
transcriptionally screening the autophagy interactome. The
autophagy qRT-PCR tool used on trastuzumab-refractory
breast cancer cells allowed for the rapid and accurate
identification of differentially expressed autophagy genes
(e.g., ATG12) that were causally associated with intrinsic
resistance to the anti-tumoral effects of the molecularly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

targeted anti-HER2 drugs. While our current ability to
accurately measure basal autophagic flux or determine
whether autophagy is activated or inhibited in patient
samples (i.e., immunohistochemical- or immunoblottingbased detection of autophagic markers, such as LC3 and
SQSTM1/p62) is very limited and of unproven utility in
human patients, the method of analysis described here or
other similar technologies involving human autophagydedicated cDNA microarrays [114], by allowing the
simultaneous monitoring of the expression level of
multiple autophagy genes, might provide a practical
method for analyzing the impact of the autophagy
interactome in the in vivo response of breast cancer
tissues to anti-cancer therapies. The degree of accuracy
that constitutive activation of autophagy, as revealed by a
transcriptome analysis using PCR arrays, can provide to
predict trastuzumab efficacy warrants further investigation
in the clinical situation.

METHODS
Drugs
The EGFR (HER1)-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
(TKI) gefitinib (ZD1839; Iressa) was kindly provided
by AstraZeneca (AstraZeneca PLC Headquarters, 15
Stanhope Gate, W1K 1LN, London, UK). The EGFR
(HER1) TKI erlotinib (Tarceva®) was a kind gift from
Roche Pharmaceuticals (Neuilly sur Seine, France). The
dual HER1/HER2-TKI1 lapatinib (GW572016; Tykerb)
was kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),
Corporate Environment, Health & Safety (Brentford,
Middlesex TW8 9GS, UK). Stock solutions of gefitinib,
erlotinib, and lapatinib (10 mmol/L) were prepared in
DMSO and stored in aliquots in the dark at -20°C until
use. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) was kindly provided
by Hospital Universitari de Girona Dr. Josep Trueta
Pharmacy (Girona, Spain). Trastuzumab was solubilized
in bacteriostatic water for injection containing 1.1%
benzyl alcohol (stock solution at 21 mg/mL), stored
at 4°C and used within 1 month. For experimental use,
all experimental agents were prepared fresh from stock
solutions and were diluted with cell growth medium.
Control cells were cultured in media containing identical
concentrations (v/v) as that used for test cells. The vehicle
solutions had no noticeable influence on the proliferation
of experimental cells.

Cell lines and culture conditions.
JIMT1 cells were obtained from the German
Collection of Microorganisms and were routinely grown
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco®
Cell Culture Systems) containing 10% heat-inactivated
1608

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 1600-1614

fetal bovine serum (FBS, Bio-Whittaker, Inc.), 1%
L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 50 U/mL penicillin,
and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. The cells were maintained at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. SKBR3
breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and were routinely grown
in Improved MEM (IMEM; Biosource International)
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine,
1% sodium pyruvate, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/
mL streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were
screened periodically for Mycoplasma contamination.

analysis tool.

Metabolic status assessment (MTT-based cell
viability assays).
Cell viability was determined using a standard
colorimetric
MTT
(3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,
5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) reduction assay.
Exponentially growing cells were harvested by
trypsinization, seeded at a concentration of ~2.5 x 103
cells/200 μL/well into 96-well plates, and allowed to
attach overnight. The medium was then removed, and
fresh medium along with various concentrations of
HER1/2 targeting drugs were added to the cultures as
specified. Control cells without drugs were cultured
in parallel using the same conditions with comparable
media changes. Drugs were not renewed during the entire
period of cell exposure. Following treatment (5 days), the
medium was removed and replaced with fresh drug-free
medium (100 μL/well), and MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) was
added to each well at a 1/10 volume. After incubation for
2–3 h at 37°C, the supernatants were carefully aspirated,
100 μL of DMSO were added to each well, and the plates
were agitated to dissolve the crystal product. The optical
density (OD) was measured at 570 nm in a multi-well
plate reader (Model Anthos Labtec 2010 1.7 reader). The
cell viability effects resulting from the exposure of cells
to HER1/2-targeting drugs were analyzed as percentages
of the control cell absorbances, which were obtained from
control wells treated with appropriate concentrations of the
agents’ vehicles, which were processed simultaneously.
For each treatment, cell viability was evaluated as a
percentage using the following equation: (OD570 of
treated sample/OD570 of untreated sample) x 100. Breast
cancer cell sensitivity to HER1/2-targeting drugs was
expressed in terms of the concentration of drug required
to decrease cell viability by 50% (IC50 value). Because
the percentage of control absorbance was considered
to be the surviving fraction of cells, the IC50 value was
defined as the concentration of HER1/2-targeting drug that
produced a 50% reduction in the control absorbance (by
interpolation), respectively. The degree of sensitization to
HER1/2-targeting drugs by shRNA-driven silencing of
ATG12 was evaluated by dividing the IC50 values of the
JIMT1 parental cells by those obtained in control-shRNA/
JIMT1 cells or ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1 cells.

Lentiviral transduction.
Pre-packaged lentiviral particles that either encoded
a non-targeting shRNA (negative shRNA, sc-108080)
or sequences specifically targeting the human ATG12
gene were purchased from a commercial provider (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). For viral infection of JIMT1
cells, the regular medium was replaced with culture
medium containing 5 µg/mL polybrene (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc-124220). JIMT1 cells were then
exposed to lentiviruses for 48 h. Because the lentiviral
shRNA particles also encode a puromycin resistance gene
for transduction selection, the cells were then washed and
grown in culture medium containing 10 μg/mL puromycin
dihydrochloride (Sigma, P9620) for an additional 72 h.
The JIMT1 cells were allowed to recover and proliferate
for at least 1 week before any experimental procedures
and were then analyzed. To monitor the lentiviral
transduction efficiency and transgene expression for
the duration of the experiment, we incubated additional
subsets of JIMT1 cells with lentiviral particles encoding
a green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter (sc-108084).
Transduction efficiency (> 90%) was obtained as the
ratio of the number of GFP-positive cells to the total
number of cells from five random visual fields from three
independent culture experiments.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR).
Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures using a
Qiagen RNeasy kit and Qiash redder columns according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. One microgram of
total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with a
Reaction ReadyTM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(SABiosciences) and applied to the Human Autophagy
RT² Profiler™ PCR Array (PAHS-084, 96-well format)
following the SABiosciences RT-PCR manual. Plates
were processed in an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast RealTime PCR System Applied Biosystems, using automated
baseline and threshold cycle detection. Data were
interpreted with SABiosciences’ web-based PCR array
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Xenograft studies.
To produce xenografts, approximately 5 x 106
JIMT1 parental cells, control-shRNA/JIMT1 cells or
ATG12-shRNA/JIMT1 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the dorsal flanks of female athymic nude mice (four to
five weeks old, 23 to 25 g; Harlan Laboratories, France).
The animals were randomized into two groups, with five
1609

animals in each group: control (vehicle) and trastuzumabtreated. Trastuzumab (5 mg/kg) was administered
intraperitoneally (i.p.) once per week. The mice were
weighed once per week after dosing, the tumor sizes were
measured daily with electronic calipers, and the tumor
volumes were calculated with the following formula:
volume (mm3) = length x width2 x 0.5. The experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) of the Institut d’Investigació
Biomèdica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL; Animal Use
Protocol #6302 authorized by the Animal Experimental
Commission of the Catalan Government, Barcelona,
