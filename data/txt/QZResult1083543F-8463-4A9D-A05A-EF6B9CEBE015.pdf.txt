BACKGROUND: Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major determinant of overall cancer mortality worldwide.
Despite progress in molecular research, current treatments offer limited benefits. Because NSCLC generates early
metastasis, and this behavior requires great cell motility, herein the authors assessed the potential value of CFL1 gene
(main member of the invasion/metastasis pathway) as a prognostic and predictive NSCLC biomarker. METHODS:
Metadata analysis of tumor tissue microarray was applied to examine expression of CFL1 in archival lung cancer samples from 111 patients, and its clinicopathologic significance was investigated. The robustness of the finding was validated using another independent data set. Finally, the authors assayed in vitro the role of CFL1 levels in tumor
invasiveness and drug resistance using 6 human NSCLC cell lines with different basal degrees of CFL1 gene expression. RESULTS: CFL1 levels in biopsies discriminate between good and bad prognosis at early tumor stages (IA, IB,
and IIA/B), where high CFL1 levels are correlated with lower overall survival rate (P < .0001). Biomarker performance
was further analyzed by immunohistochemistry, hazard ratio (P < .001), and receiver-operating characteristic curve
(area ¼ 0.787; P < .001). High CFL1 mRNA levels and protein content are positively correlated with cellular invasiveness (determined by Matrigel Invasion Chamber System) and resistance (2-fold increase in drug 50% growth inhibition dose) against a list of 22 alkylating agents. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the CFL1 gene network had the
same robustness for stratified NSCLC patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the CFL1 gene and its functional gene network can be used as prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC and could also guide chemotherapeutic interC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Lung cancer accounts for 1.3 million deaths annually (World Health Organization), of which 85% are of nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. These patients present an average survival rate of 10 months, and only 15% survive for 5
years.1 Currently, prognosis of NSCLC patients is done by considering patient performance status and tumor staging.2,3
However, accumulating data4 has shown that these have unsatisfactory power in predicting patient outcome or in guiding
physicians on the best course of action for each patient. A novel prognostic method for early stage NSCLC patients can
potentially increase survival rates by indicating those in need of more aggressive treatment.5
Lung cancers in particular show poor prognosis because of their ability to generate early metastasis within the lungs
and then in distant organs. This behavior requires great cell motility, which is performed by several proteins that act on
the actin cytoskeleton by regulating cycles of polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments, which in turn generates cell motion.
One of the main proteins in charge of cell motility is cofilin (CFL1, cofilin-1; nonmuscle isoform; gene ID, 1072),6
which is regulated by factors such as phosphorylation, pH, binding of phosphoinositides, and subcellular compartmentalization. In a recent study, we have found that cofilin mediates apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, which is a novel

regulatory activity described for this protein.7 The role of
the cofilin pathway in cell mobility has been shown extensively.8 Its activation occurs locally and in response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in
chemotaxis.9 High cofilin activity has been correlated
with breast cancer invasion and metastasis,10,11 where it is
essential for directional sensing,12 and with epithelialmesenchymal transition, a process that is involved in the
regulation of cell migration, adhesion, and invasion, suggesting the acquisition of a invasive phenotype.13 Thus,
we raised the hypothesis that cofilin amount in NSCLC
could provide relevant information about a tumor’s
aggressiveness and therefore be used as a prognostic
marker.
Herein, we assessed the potential prognostic value of
CFL1 as a NSCLC biomarker. To assay that, we used 3
different experimental approaches: the first based on the
correlation of gene expression levels and patient outcome
using meta-analysis of clinical data from a large, homogeneous, well-defined collection of samples from NSCLC
cohorts; the second based on the analysis of in vitro data
obtained with 6 different human NSCLC cell lines; and
the third in which we constructed a network-based model
of CFL1 gene and analyzed the role of each network component on the cellular resistance profile to different
chemotherapeutic drugs.

Survival data analysis

Standard Kaplan-Meier mortality curves and their
significance levels were generated for clusters of patients
using SPSS software (SPSS for Windows, release 14.0.0,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). The survival curves are compared
using the log-rank test, and patients are clustered according to either biomarker expression level or NCSLC stage
grouping.4,16
Cox multivariable regression analysis

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression
models were used to test the independent contribution of
each variable on mortality. Graphical assessment was used
to assess the Cox model’s proportional hazard assumption. Results of multivariate analysis were summarized by
calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).
Biomarker accuracy

The area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve was used to evaluate the biomarker’s ability
in discriminating patients who survived and those who
died. An optimal cutoff value was obtained considering
the combination of highest sensitivity and specificity.

Cohort Studies and Data Analysis
Patients, tumor samples, and microarray datasets

In Vitro Assays

For NSCLC cohort analysis, we accessed a large
well-defined collection of lung cancer samples with
expression data and relevant clinical and pathologic information on 111 patients (testing cohort), from core biopsies of patients’ tumors. The data were obtained from the
Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/; Series GSE3141) and the
Duke Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy website
(http://data.cgt.duke.edu/oncogene.php). Gene array
data are available on the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, Calif)
U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip.14 To test the reproducibility
of the data, we assessed a second, independent microarray data set (validation cohort), which is available on a
different microarray platform (Affymetrix HG_U95Av2
GeneChip).15 The validation cohort comprises microarray data from 86 tumor biopsies obtained from sequential
patients seen at the University of Michigan Hospital for
stage I or stage III lung adenocarcinomas. All gene array

Immunohistochemical staining

Paraffin-embedded sections of lung samples from
20 patients with NSCLC (classified according to World
Health Organization criteria) were obtained as archival
specimens from the Department of Pathology at the São
João Batista Hospital in Criciúma, Brazil. Hematoxylin
and eosin-stained slides of lung tissue were examined by a
national board-certified pathologist. Selected areas of lung
cancer and corresponding benign samples were sectioned
into 3-lm slices, and immunohistochemical staining was
performed according to the standard avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex technique. Rabbit polyclonal antihuman cofilin-1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass) (1
lg/mL) was used as the primary antibody. The brownish
color was considered to be evidence of a positive expression of cofilin-1 in the tumor cells. Unstained red blood
cells and labeled macrophages were considered, respectively, as negative and positive internal controls. The

Cell culture and Western blot immunoassay
The human NSCLC cell lines were obtained from the
National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Division of
Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis tumor/cell line repository, and grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine at 37 C in 5% CO2 in air. Exponentially growing
cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris,
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic
acid, 1% Triton, 1 mM Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors.
After sonication, 30 lg of protein was electrophoresed on
4% to 12% Bis-Tris NuPage gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Calif), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Billerica, Mass), and
blocked with 5% milk. The following antibodies were
used for Western blot immunoassay: rabbit polyclonal
anticofilin (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal antiactin (1:2000)
(Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo). Horseradish peroxidaselinked secondary antibody (1:10,000) was from DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, Calif). Bands were observed by
chemiluminescence using the ECL Detection kit from
Amersham Biosciences (Fairfield, Conn) and exposure of
x-ray film. Quantification of band was done with ImageJ
1.36b software (National Institutes of Health).

Cell migration and invasion assays

Drug cytotoxicity

Drug 50% growth inhibition dose (GI50) was determined as described elsewhere. Briefly, exponentially
growing NSCLC cell lines were treated with different
concentrations of drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and paclitaxel [Taxol]) (Sigma, St.
Louis, Mo). After 72 hours, the medium was removed,
and cells were fixed with cold 10% trichloracetic acid
(TCA) for 1 hour at 4 C. Plates were washed 5 with distilled water and left to dry at room temperature. Cells
were stained with 0.4% of sulforhodamine B (Sigma) (w/
v) in 1% acetic acid (v/v) at room temperature for 20
minutes. Sulforhodamine B was removed, and the plates
were washed 5 with 1% acetic acid before air-drying.
Bound dye was solubilized with 10 mM unbuffered Trisbase solution, and plates were left on a plate shaker for at
least 10 minutes. Absorbance was measured in a 96-well
plate reader (VERSAmax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
Calif) at 492 nm. GI50 was calculated according to the
concentration-response curve. The mean of 3 independ-

In vitro migration and invasion assays were performed using the BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber
System (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif). Briefly, Matrigel inserts were rehydrated in RPMI medium, and cells
(2.5  104 cells) were seeded at each 24-well chamber.
The chemoattractant (medium RPMI with 10% of FBS)
was added to the lower wells, and the movement of cells
through the 8.0-lm pore size Tran-swell cell culture
inserts, either uncoated (migration) or Matrigel coated
(invasion), was determined after 22 hours of incubation at
37 C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere. At the end of the assay, cells were removed from
the top side of the insert using a cotton swab. Cells that
penetrated to the underside surfaces of the inserts were
fixed and stained with a HEMA 3 staining kit (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass) and counted under the microscope. Data are expressed as the percentage invasion
through the Matrigel relative to the migration through
the uncoated membrane, and expressed as invasion index.
The mean of 3 high power fields for each condition run in
triplicates is plotted.
Bioinformatics Analysis
Microarray data from the NCI-60 cancer cell panel

Transcript expression profiles of the 6 human
NSCLC cell lines were obtained from the NCI-60 human
tumor cell line anticancer drug screen (http://discover.nci.
nih.gov/datasetsNature2000.jsp). To test the reproducibility of the data, we assessed a second, independent microarray data set available at http://discover.nci.nih.gov/
cellminer/home.do (Robust Multi-array Average [RMA]
normalized Affymetrix HG-U133A/B data set). This second microarray platform comprises the human transcriptome and consistently identifies gene probes (eg, it follows
approved gene IDs from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee, http://www. genenames.org/), allowing the
proper identification of CFL1 partners in the biological
network analysis.

For drug panel activity analysis, we considered those
compounds listed in the Mechanism of Action drug activity database of the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program (http://discover.nci.nih.

Clustering analysis and expression profile of
CFL1 gene network

The strategy to assess the functional status of tumor
samples based on gene expression network profiles has
been previously described.20,21 Two-way hierarchical
clustering analysis was performed with the Cluster 3.0
software package using the complete linkage clustering
option.22 For visualization purposes, the gene expression
values were median-centered and normalized. The results
were processed and observed in TreeView software.23 The
color intensity was set to the log2 ratio of the microarray
signal. Probes of all genes listed in the CFL1 gene network
could be retrieved from the microarray platform (ie, the
cohort study—its corresponding gene expression database—is provided on the Human Genome U133-Plus 2.0
Array).

Figure 3. Cofilin immunocontent correlates with tumor invasiveness in vitro. Six human nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cell lines composed of adenocarcinomas (H-23,
A549, EKVX), large cells (H-460, HOP-92), and squamouscell carcinomas (H-226) from the NCI-60 panel were selected
based on different levels of CFL1 gene expression (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/datasetsNature 2000.jsp) to establish the
role of CFL1 in tumor aggressiveness, evaluated by assays of
cell invasion and drug resistance. (A) Western blot analysis
shows that the pattern of CFL1 mRNA (symbols) matches the
level of cofilin immunocontent (bars). (B) Invasion index was
obtained by determining the movement of cells through an

RESULTS
Kaplan-Meier estimates of patient cumulative survival by
time (months) according to the expression level of CFL1
showed that when patients are grouped by CFL1 gene
expression (upper fifth vs lower fifth of transcript abundance levels), the expression levels can be used to discriminate patients in early disease stages (IA, IB, IIA, and IIB)
between good or bad outcome (Fig. 1A; based on metadata
analysis). Data on microarray gene expression and patient
information such as age, sex, cancer histological type, and
NSCLC staging were considered (cohort description can
be found in Table 1). Cox multivariate regression revealed
that lower CFL1 expression was significantly associated
with high overall survival (HR for high risk vs low risk, 2.7;
95% CI, 1.5-4.7; P ¼ .001) (Fig. 1B).
Analysis of 85 patients with disease stages I or II (the
testing cohort), revealed that patients with high CFL1
expression (n ¼ 42) had an overall survival rate shorter
than those with low CFL1 expression (n ¼ 43) (Fig. 2A).
To test the robustness of this finding, we analyzed a second, independent data set of 67 patients in early stages
(the validation cohort) (Fig. 2B). Our meta-analysis
showed that high CFL1 levels are associated with shorter
overall survival in both cohorts. ROC curve analysis
showed that CFL1 sensitivity/specificity is high enough to
indicate the outcome of patients with early disease stages
(area under ROC curve ¼ 0.787) (Fig. 2C). Immunohistochemical stains revealed an increased cofilin immunocontent within the neoplastic tissue (Fig. 2D). The data
presented in Figures 1 and 2 suggest that CFL1 levels can
be used to indicate patient outcome.

crossed against 50% growth inhibition dose (GI50) values of 118 standard chemotherapy agents (from the NCI-60 drug discovery
pipeline). P values have been color coded according to the scale shown; P < .05 indicates a significant negative correlation (resistance), whereas P > .95 indicates a significant positive correlation (sensitivity). The major mechanism of drug action is shown
(the term ‘‘alkylating agents’’ is used broadly to include platinating agents; Uk indicates unknown; P90, hsp90 binder; Pi, protein

an individual drug. (B) In vitro validation of the cytotoxicity for selected drugs assayed by the sulforhodamine B method is shown
(upper plots). The obtained drug GI50 values were correlated with cofilin immunocontent (lower plots). NSCLC indicates nonsmall
cell lung cancer.

We also investigated whether CFL1 levels could provide additional insights into the pathophysiology of
NSCLC, predicting tumor aggressiveness and/or chemotherapy response. To do that, we used NSCLC data from
the US National Cancer Institute in vitro anticancer drug
screen (NCI-60 cancer panel).19 Six human cell lines of
the 3 major histological types of NSCLC, namely adenocarcinomas cells (H-23, A549, EKVX), squamous cells
carcinomas (H-226), and large cells carcinomas (H-460,
HOP-92), were analyzed. Relative levels of CFL1 gene
expression obtained by microarray are presented in Figure
3A (symbols) and match the amount of cofilin protein
evaluated here (Fig. 3A; bars). Then, using the BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion System (to assess the tumor’s metastatic potential) (BD Biosciences), we found that

Cancer

different histological types expressing higher CFL1 levels
presented higher invasion indexes, which indicates a more
aggressive invasiveness behavior (Fig. 3B).
In addition to this higher invasiveness potential,
analysis of microarray data of the 6 cell lines and respective GI50 values of 118 standard chemotherapy agents
(from the NCI-60 drug discovery pipeline) revealed that
high levels of CFL1 mRNA are also correlated with resistance against different anticancer drugs—mainly alkylating agents (Fig. 4A; meta-analysis) (for a list of all
correlated alkylating drugs see Table 2). Exposure of the
cell lines to different concentrations of selected chemotherapy drugs (namely cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and paclitaxel) revealed significant
correlations between cofilin immunocontent and

resistance to cisplatin and carboplatin, the 2 alkylating
agents tested (Fig. 4B; in vitro analysis).
By using the same approach on drug resistance, we
evaluated the resistance profile against alkylating agents of
each gene product that interacts directly with CFL1. Four
of cofilin’s partners (CAP1, ACTB, SSH3, and YWHAZ
genes) show a resistance profile similar to cofilin, suggesting that a functional network is correlated with this tumor
phenotype. These results are presented as network-based
model of the cofilin biological pathway (Fig. 5A, red
nodes), where nodes represent gene products, and connecting lines indicate physical and/or functional associations according to experimental data (http://string.
embl.de/).
To further explore the role of this gene network in
NCSLC patient outcome, a cluster analysis was carried
out using the data bank from the testing cohort. As the
microarray data set from this cohort study was produced
on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 platform, all genes listed

3652

in our network could be retrieved. Complete linkage clustering of tumor samples is shown in TreeView format
(Fig. 5B). From the Heat Map, we identified 3 large tumor clusters, which were then used to restratify the
NSCLC patients according to the gene expression profile.
Kaplan-Meier estimates based on this new stratification
showed that the CFL1 gene network can also be used to
discriminate patients’ outcomes (Fig. 5C).

DISCUSSION
Although much progress has been made in reducing overall mortality rates, cancer is a major public health problem
worldwide, accounting for more deaths than heart disease.
Most recent epidemiological data show a notable trend in
stabilization of incidence rates for all cancer and a continued decrease in the cancer death rate.1 Whereas the
decrease in death rates for colorectal, breast, and prostate
cancer largely reflects improvements in early detection
and treatment, the decrease in lung cancer death rates
reflects manly the reduction in tobacco use.24,25
In this scenario, NSCLC is the leading cause of
deaths annually. Currently, prognosis of NSCLC patients
is still based almost exclusively on the anatomical extent of
disease, which may have reached its limit of usefulness for
predicting outcomes.4 Advances in molecular pathology
have led to the development of many candidate biomarkers with potential clinical value. However, according
to the TNM tumor staging system, few tumors are formally staged with the addition of molecular biomarker
information (eg, TNM þ S; where S ¼ serum levels of the
selected biomarker), which does not include lung
cancers.3
Herein we are proposing the use of CFL1 gene
expression levels as a prognostic and predictive NSCLC
biomarker based on the following findings: 1) CFL1
mRNA levels are highly sensitive and specific in discriminating between good and bad patient outcome in 2 independent cohorts—specially in early stage disease—where
tumors with low expression of the CFL1 gene are associated with high overall survival; 2) an association exists
between cofilin immunocontent and tumor invasion; 3)
cells with high cofilin mRNA and protein levels are resistant to alkylating drug treatment; and 4) 4 other genes that
interact in the CFL1 pathway (named SSH3, YWHZ,
CAP1, and ACTB) also demonstrate the same resistance
profile.
As previously shown, to be able to generate early metastasis, tumor cells require the activity of cofilin to

Figure 5. Prognostic and drug resistance markers of the CFL1 functional gene network are shown. (A) A graphic model represents the CFL1 functional gene network versus alkylating drug sensitivity/resistance profiles. Nodes represent gene products;
connecting lines indicate physical and/or functional associations according to experimental data (http://string.embl.de/). Gene
expression data (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/home.do) were crossed against 50% growth inhibition dose values of all alkylating agents identified in the resistance panel (Fig. 4A). Four CFL1 network partners follow the same resistance profile (red
nodes; n ¼ number of drugs for which gene expression showed correlation). The network drawn was built using a spring model
algorithm. Further detains are given in Materials Methods. (B) Two-way hierarchical clustering analysis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors is shown. This panel presents the NSCLC cohort data (referred to as Testing cohort in Table 1) arranged
according to the gene expression profile of all CFL1 network components. Complete linkage clustering of tumor samples is shown
in TreeView format. The color intensity is relative to the log2 ratio of the microarray signal (red, positive values; green, negative
values). For visualization purposes, the gene expression values were median centered and normalized using Cluster 3.0 software.
(C) A Kaplan-Meier plot of the entire NSCLC cohort data (n ¼ 111) is shown, where patients are stratified according to the hierarchical clustering analysis of the CFL1 functional gene network.

modulate actin cytoskeleton, generating cell mobility.9,10
Therefore, as cofilin is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor invasion, it stands to reason
that NSCLC patients with high tumor CFL1 expression
levels present low overall survival rates, even in early stage
disease. Our data obtained by in vitro experiments suggest
that cofilin levels also could be used to predict tumor resistance to alkylating agents. The correlation between
high levels of cofilin and alkylating drug resistance probably is the most important finding of this study, because
this class of drugs is among the most effective cytotoxic
agents for advanced cancer treatments and has long been

the cornerstone of NSCLC management.26,27 Although
this treatment improves patient survival, the benefit is
stage-dependent. Unfortunately, intrinsic or acquired resistance to alkylating agents is frequently encountered and
severely limits its therapeutic potential.28 Our findings
may have great impact on survival rates, as currently there
is no way to predict and identify potential responders.
Although we focused our analysis on the role of
CFL1 gene in alkylating drugs resistance, we also
expanded the potential biological relevance of our findings by testing the role of other cofilin partners on tumor
resistance. Doing so, we obtained a signature based on 5

biological related genes (members of the cofilin pathway).
These genes can be used in combination to characterize
the tumor resistance phenotype. This approach is consistent with other studies that have proposed the use of gene
combination to enhance biomarker robustness, which
may potentially deal better with intrinsic intra- and intersample heterogeneity.29-31 For instance, Chen et al32 have
described a biomarker cluster comprising the combination of DUSP6, MMD, STAT1, ERBB3, and LCK gene
expression to predict the clinical outcome of NSCLC
patients. This signature was obtained based on the statistical (not biological) combination of high-throughput
screening of cDNA microarray probes. Likewise, other
authors have used the same strategy to identify low/high
NSCLC risk phenotypes.14,15
In this sense, our 5-gene signature emerges from a
functional gene network comprising all described cofilin
partners. To further explore this finding using the
NSCLC cohort data, we assigned subsets of tumors (clusters) based on related expression patterns, represented in
the tree structure, or dendrograms. By using all CFL1
gene network components, the hierarchical clustering
analysis put together the similar network datasets, stratifying NSCLC patients in 3 large subgroups, whose outcomes differ to the same extent as observed for CFL1 gene
alone. The effect of this strategy of assessing tumors is the
distribution of biomarker task among related genes, as
opposed to focus on 1 or several nonrelated ones, which
can potentially reduce the effect of random fluctuations
on biomarker performance. Further investigation of the
molecular properties of this network should be helpful to
validate these genes as prognostic and predictive markers
in NSCLC, or even in other cancer types, given that the
CFL1 gene is widely expressed33 and more specifically in
some subtypes (eg, colorectal adenocarcinomas33,34).
Our findings have clear implications for NSCLC
management and therapy, as CFL1 expression levels can
be used to indicate which patients should receive a more
aggressive therapy in an attempt to reverse the poor prognosis. Because CFL1 expression levels also correlate with
drug resistance, our findings can also be used to decide the
best course of action for each patient, representing a contribution to translational medicine for treating NSCLC.
In the adjuvant setting, for example, cisplatin-based
chemotherapy constitutes the standard first-line treatment
for patients with early stage and good performance status.27 Because CFL1 expression appears to be a marker of
resistance to platinum agents, patients whose tumors harbor high levels of CFL1 would benefit from a different

3654

treatment modality. In these cases, possible trials to test alternative adjuvant regimens would be based on the combination of other drugs commonly used in NSCLC (eg,
gemcitabine, docetaxel, and vinorelbine) or EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies. The combination of EGFR
inhibitors with first-line chemotherapy is currently under
evaluation, and efforts have been made to identify subgroups of NSCLC patients who respond to these
agents.35-37 The refinement of patient stratification with
the use of CFL1 gene signature provides the opportunity
to design a prospective, large-scale, randomized clinical
trial that would evaluate these ideas.
