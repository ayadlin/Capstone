Abstract
The androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. In this
study, we found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, a well-established regulator of metabolic
signaling, was induced after androgen stimulation of AR-expressing prostate cancer cells. PTP1B induction by
androgen occurred at the mRNA and protein levels to increase PTP1B activity. High-resolution chromosome
mapping revealed AR recruitment to two response elements within the ﬁrst intron of the PTP1B encoding
gene PTPN1, correlating with an AR-mediated increase in RNA polymerase II recruitment to the PTPN1
transcriptional start site. We found that PTPN1 and AR genes were coampliﬁed in metastatic tumors and that
PTPN1 ampliﬁcation was associated with a subset of high-risk primary tumors. Functionally, PTP1B depletion
delayed the growth of androgen-dependent human prostate tumors and impaired androgen-induced cell
migration and invasion in vitro. However, PTP1B was also required for optimal cell migration of androgenindependent cells. Collectively, our results established the AR as a transcriptional regulator of PTPN1
transcription and implicated PTP1B in a tumor-promoting role in prostate cancer. Our ﬁndings support
the preclinical testing of PTP1B inhibitors for prostate cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 72(6); 1529–37.

Introduction
Despite early diagnosis and efﬁcient treatment of most
early-stage tumors, prostate cancer remains the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in North American
men (1). This discrepancy is the result of the lack of
biomarkers able to discriminate between indolent and
aggressive tumors, as well as the absence of curative options
for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRMPC;
ref. 2). The androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in the
development and progression of prostate cancer, and androgen deprivation therapy and/or AR blockade continues to be
the standard treatment for advanced or recurrent tumors,

even though the majority of patients eventually develop
CRMPC (3).
Remarkably, most castration-resistant tumors still depend
on the AR for their growth and survival, a feature that underscores the "addiction" of prostate cancer cells to AR signaling
(4, 5). In primary tumors, this concept is further supported
by the presence of common genetic alterations that directly
and/or indirectly affect AR-dependent transcription. For
instance, the loss of NKX3-1 and PTEN tumor suppressor genes
has been associated with Akt-mediated ligand-independent AR
activity (6, 7), although recent ﬁndings challenge this concept
and suggest that PI3K-Akt and AR signaling pathways regulate
each other through reciprocal feedback (8, 9). Besides, the
prostate-speciﬁc AR-induced TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein
has also been shown to regulate AR transcriptional activity
(10). The characterization of signaling pathways acting
upstream and downstream of the AR is therefore of paramount
importance to identify new therapeutic targets that could
interfere with AR signaling not only in CRMPC but also at
earlier stages of the disease.
One largely unexplored mechanism in prostate tumors is the
regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by classical protein
tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). Instead, the vast majority of
studies have addressed the contribution of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, as important mediators of tumorpromoting signals responsible for the induction and/or
enhancement of AR activity, as well as inducers of AR-independent survival mechanisms (11, 12). But abnormal regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation–dependent signaling in cancer cells can also be caused by altered PTP signaling. In fact,

mutations and/or aberrant expression of several PTPs have
been reported in different cancer types and shown not only to
counteract oncogenic tyrosine kinases but as well to directly
promote tumor development and progression (13). With
respect to prostate cancer, however, only a limited number
of classical PTPs have been investigated and their relationship
with AR-dependent signaling remains largely unknown (13).
To address this issue, we ﬁrst proﬁled the expression of
classical PTPs in the context of AR-dependent signaling.
Unexpectedly, we found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase
1B (PTP1B) gene PTPN1, previously reported as being induced
in androgen-deprived conditions (14), is actually induced after
androgen stimulation and is a direct transcriptional target of
the AR. In primary prostate tumors, we observed a positive
correlation between PTP1B expression, AR nuclear localization, and Ki-67 nuclear index. We also found that PTPN1 is
frequently ampliﬁed in metastatic tumors and a subset of highrisk primary tumors. Finally, we provide evidence that PTP1B
depletion decreases LNCaP tumor growth rates in vivo and
abrogates androgen-induced cell migration and invasion in
vitro. These ﬁndings support a tumor-promoting role for
PTP1B in prostate cancer and suggest that PTP1B inhibition
may be of use in the treatment of the disease.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
LNCaP, 22rv1, and DU145 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI-1640
medium (Wisent) supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine,
and 50 mg/mL gentamycin. C4-2 cells were obtained from MD
Anderson (Houston, TX) and maintained in the same conditions. The synthetic androgen analog R1881 was obtained from
Perkin Elmer. For androgenic stimulation assays, cells were
ﬁrst androgen deprived in phenol-free RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS, L-glutamine, and 50 mg/mL
gentamycin. After 48 hours, medium was refreshed and R1881
or ethanol (vehicle) was added for different time periods.
For short interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, cells were
incubated for 24 hours with 100 nmol/L siRNA or nontargeting
control before androgen deprivation.
Analysis of gene and protein expression
Total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were done as already described (15).
The primer sequences used can be found in Supplementary
Table S1. Threshold cycle numbers were calculated using the
second derivative maximum obtained with the LightCycler480
software version 3.5 (Roche). Data was normalized according
to both PPIB and ARBP levels (Supplementary Table S1).
Immunoblotting procedures were done as previously
described (15). Membranes were probed with the following
antibodies according to manufacturer's instructions: mouse
monoclonal anti-PTP1B (BD Transduction Laboratories),
mouse monoclonal anti-AR (Lab Vision), rabbit polyclonal
anti-calnexin (Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse monoclonal anti-PSA (Lab Vision). Densitometry analyses were done
with ImageJ (U.S. NIH, Bethesda, MD; http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

Phosphatase assay
Cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer supplemented with 3 mmol/L DTT and EDTAfree complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). PTP1B was
immunoprecipitated 2 hours at 4 C using 200 mg of protein
lysate, 1 mg of mouse monoclonal anti-PTP1B clone AE4-2J
(EMD4Biosciences), and 30 mL of Protein G agarose beads
(Fisher Canada). Beads were then washed 3 times in RIPA
buffer and once in assay buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES, 3 mmol/L
DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin). The phosphatase
assay was done as previously described (16) using DIFMUP
(Invitrogen) as the PTP1B substrate and, where indicated, 50
mmol/L of a PTP1B inhibitor (kind gift from Brian Kennedy,
Merck Frosst, Pointe-Claire, Qc).

Chromatin was prepared from LNCaP cells exposed to 1
nmol/L R1881 or vehicle for 4 hours following pretreatment
with 20 mmol/L bicalutamide (BIC) or vehicle for 30 minutes.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was done as described previously (17) using antibodies speciﬁc to AR (mouse
monoclonal anti-AR from Lab Vision and BD Biosciences)
or the activated RNA polymerase II [RNAPol II; rat monoclonal anti-RNAPol II subunit B1 (phospho CTD Ser-2) from
Millipore]. Quantiﬁcation of ChIP enrichment by qPCR was
carried out using the LightCycler480 instrument (Roche).
Ampliﬁcation and labeling of AR-bound ChIP fragments was
done as described previously (18). Hybridization was carried
out on custom designed chr.20 Agilent tiled arrays (150 bp
resolution) and analyzed using Feature Extraction 10 and
ChIP Analytics 3.1 (Agilent). The primers used for standard
ChIP quantiﬁcation and validation are listed in Supplementary
Table S1.

between ampliﬁcation of the PTPN1 locus or its increased RNA
expression and the indicated events (Fig. 4E and F) was
identiﬁed based on the 2-tailed Fisher exact test. For RNA
expression data, a z-score threshold of 1.5 SDs was used to
separate low ( 1.5) or high (1.5) from normal expression.

Results
Androgen treatment induces PTP1B expression in
AR-expressing prostate cancer cells
We screened for classical PTP transcripts that could be
modulated by androgen stimulation. Androgen-sensitive
LNCaP cells were maintained in steroid-depleted medium for
48 hours before stimulation with the synthetic androgen
analog R1881. We carried out gene expression proﬁling after
24 hours of treatment and detected changes in mRNA levels
for 11 classical PTPs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Surprisingly,
we noted an AR-dependent increase in the levels of the PTPN1
transcript, despite previous ﬁndings linking the induction of
PTPN1 expression to androgen deprivation (14). Using qPCR,
we conﬁrmed a time- and dose-dependent increase in PTPN1
mRNA levels in LNCaP cells treated with R1881 (Fig. 1A and B).
In AR-expressing androgen-independent C4-2 and 22rv1 cells,
the upregulation of PTPN1 mRNA was also signiﬁcant (Fig. 1C
and Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast, PTPN1 levels were
not affected by R1881 treatment in AR-depleted or AR-negative
cells (Fig. 1C and D and Supplementary Fig. S2B–D). Notably,
basal PTPN1 mRNA levels did not decrease in untreated ARdepleted cells (Fig. 1C and D) despite a PTPN1 mRNA half-life of
about 8 hours (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that other
transcription factors can also regulate basal PTPN1 expression.
Ultimately, the AR-mediated activation of PTPN1 led to an
increase in PTP1B protein levels (Fig. 2A and B), which
translated into a dose-dependent increase in total PTP1B
phosphatase activity (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, substrate-trapping experiments revealed differential binding of PTP1B to

Migration and invasion assays
LNCaP, C4-2, and DU145 cells were treated for siRNA
experiments as described in the cell culture section, except
for DU145 cells that were not androgen deprived before the
experiment. Details about the migration procedure are
reported in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Mouse experimental procedures
Six-week-old male severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(SCID) mice (Jackson Laboratories) were subcutaneously
injected with 2  106 shCTRL1a, shCTRL1b, shPTP1B1a, or
shPTP1B2 cells resuspended in a 200 mL 70% PBS/30% Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) solution. Ten mice per group were monitored
daily for their physical health and once a week for tumor
occurrence. Tumor volume was measured using the following
equation: length  width  depth  0.5236 (20). The animal
protocol followed the Canadian Council on Animal Care
ethical regulations and was approved by the McGill University
Research and Ethics Animal Committee.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were carried out with the Prism 5.0
GraphPad Software. The Mann–Whitney or the Kruskal–
Wallis tests were used to compare the distributions between
2 or more groups, respectively. The Spearman's rho correlation
test was used to measure correlation coefﬁcients between
clinicopathologic and molecular variables. Kaplan–Meier and

phosphotyrosine substrates in androgen-depleted and R1881treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Taken together, these
results supported a connection between AR-dependent signaling and PTP1B activity in prostate cancer cells.
The PTPN1 gene is a direct AR transcriptional target
We assessed whether the AR could regulate PTPN1 expression through direct recruitment on androgen-responsive elements (ARE) located in the vicinity of PTPN1. Because the
location of AREs is not restricted to gene promoter regions and
often contains degenerated motifs (21, 22), we designed a highresolution tiled microarray spanning the entire human 20q
chromosome enclosing PTPN1 to carry out location analysis of
AR by ChIP hybridized to the array (ChIP-on-chip) in R1881treated LNCaP cells. The AR-bound segments identiﬁed by
ChIP-on-chip were submitted to de novo binding site identiﬁcation. The most enriched sequence (P value 4.3  103;
Fig. 3A) was signiﬁcantly associated to the known glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE/ARE; P value 1.7  104). No
signiﬁcant AR recruitment was detected within the PTPN1

1532

promoter although 2 AR-associated segments were identiﬁed
in the ﬁrst intron of PTPN1 located at þ6.10 kb and þ28.22 kb
downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), respectively
(Fig. 3B). The AR-bound region located at þ28.22 kb harbors a
putative GRE/ARE binding site. To test whether the recruitment of AR at these sites was modulated by androgen, we
pretreated LNCaP cells with the AR antagonist bicalutamide
(BIC) for 30 minutes before R1881 stimulation. BIC treatment
prevented the R1881-dependent recruitment of AR at the þ6.10
kb and þ28.22 kb enhancer sites (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the
recruitment of AR at these enhancers is directed by androgen.
Interestingly, modest AR occupancy was also detected at the
PTPN1 TSS when cells were treated with R1881 (Fig. 3C),
concomitant with a signiﬁcant R1881-dependent increase in
the recruitment of transcriptionally active RNA polymerase II
(RNAPol II; Fig. 3D). BIC pretreatment also abrogated the
R1881-dependent AR and RNAPol II recruitment at the PTPN1
TSS (Fig. 3C and D), suggesting that activation of AR is
necessary to contribute to the recruitment of RNApol II for
transcriptional activation of the gene. Collectively, these ﬁndings validated AR as a transcriptional regulator of PTPN1
expression in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells.

Elevated PTP1B expression in prostate primary tumors
correlates with AR nuclear localization and the tumor
proliferative index
The AR-dependent regulation of PTP1B in androgen-dependent cells prompted us to characterize PTP1B expression in
androgen-dependent primary prostate tumors. We analyzed
PTP1B expression by immunohistochemistry on a tissue
microarray (TMA) regrouping more than 300 cores from 62
patients that had undergone radical prostatectomy. We
detected PTP1B expression in both normal adjacent and
cancerous luminal cells, as well as in prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia lesions (PIN). Most normal and PIN tissues displayed
weak cytoplasmic PTP1B levels, with occasional strong punctate staining of luminal cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, tumor cells
showed a marked increase in PTP1B expression (Fig. 4A and B).
The overexpression of PTP1B in primary tumors was not
related to the degree of histologic differentiation (Fig. 4C and
Supplementary Table S3) or to other clinicopathologic parameters, except for a negative correlation with the surgical
margin status (Supplementary Table S3). At the molecular
level, however, PTP1B expression positively correlated with AR
nuclear localization (Fig. 4D), thus providing in vivo evidence
for a link between AR activation and PTP1B expression.
Interestingly, both nuclear AR and PTP1B also correlated with
the tumor proliferative index, as determined by Ki-67 staining
(Fig. 4D). This suggested that PTP1B may not only be regulated
by the AR but may also exert tumor-promoting effects in
prostate tumors.
Ampliﬁcation of the PTPN1 gene is associated with
metastatic prostate cancer and a subgroup of high-risk
primary tumors
To gather additional evidence for a role of PTP1B in prostate
cancer pathogenesis, we examined the status of the PTPN1
gene in an independent cohort of 218 patients (19).

Figure 3. PTPN1 is a direct target of the AR. A, sequence logo depicting a GRE sequence enriched in AR-bound segments identiﬁed by ChIP-on-chip obtained
following a de novo motif discovery. B, binding proﬁle of AR from the ChIP-on-chip carried out with LNCaP cells on a high-resolution tiled array
covering PTPN1 and its vicinity (N ¼ 2). C and D, standard ChIP in LNCaP cells shows that AR is recruited to the 6 kb (Kruskal–Wallis test, P < 0.05)
and 28 kb enhancers (C; Kruskal–Wallis test, near to signiﬁcance, P ¼ 0.075) upon R1881 treatment. We also observed a slight but nonsigniﬁcant
increase in AR recruitment at the TSS (Kruskal–Wallis test, P ¼ 0.134). AR binding at these sites was abrogated when cells were pretreated with BIC
(representative experiment, N ¼ 2  SEM). D, RNAPol II occupancy at the TSS was increased after treatment with R1881 (Kruskal–Wallis test, P < 0.05) but
not when cells were pretreated with BIC (representative experiment, N ¼ 2  SEM).

Interestingly, PTPN1 ampliﬁcation was found in 6.6% (12 of
181) of primary tumors and enriched in 21.6% (8 of 37) of the
metastatic tumor samples (Fig. 4E). In addition, the PTPN1
ampliﬁcation in primary tumors was signiﬁcantly associated
with a previously identiﬁed pattern of copy number alterations
[cluster 5 as deﬁned by Taylor and colleagues (19)], found
predictive of early recurrence after radical prostatectomy.
PTPN1 ampliﬁcation and mRNA expression also signiﬁcantly
correlated with AR gene ampliﬁcation and transcript levels,
respectively (Fig. 4E and F). These ﬁndings complemented our
ChIP-on-chip and immunohistochemical results and are consistent with the AR-mediated induction of PTPN1 in human
prostate cancer. Moreover, given the special role of AR signaling in prostate cancer and its exclusive ampliﬁcation in latestage disease, our identiﬁcation of a positive correlation
between AR and PTPN1 ampliﬁcation and expression strongly
supports a role for PTP1B in prostate cancer progression.
PTP1B plays a tumor-promoting role in prostate cancer
cells
To address the role of PTP1B in vivo, stable LNCaP-derived
clones expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) against PTP1B
(shPTP1B), or a nontargeting control shRNA (shCTRL), were
injected in the right ﬂank of male SCID mice (Fig. 5A).
Subsequent weekly monitoring revealed that PTP1B depletion
signiﬁcantly delayed tumor occurrence, with a median time to
onset of 9 weeks for shPTP1B tumors, compared with 6 weeks
for shCTRL xenografts (Fig. 5B). On average, shPTP1B tumors
also grew more slowly at a rate of approximately 35 mm3 per
week, compared with approximately 175 mm3 a week for
shCTRL tumors (Fig. 5C). Importantly, analysis of PTP1B

expression in endpoint tumors showed no signiﬁcant difference between shPTP1B and shCTRL specimens (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that the restoration of endogenous
PTP1B levels was required for the growth of shPTP1B clones.
We next attempted to identify the mechanism(s) by which
PTP1B promotes tumor growth. Although PTP1B silencing did
not affect cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S6), it significantly impaired the migratory and invasive properties of
LNCaP cells (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S7 and S8).
Importantly, this was exclusively observed in androgen-stimulated conditions, which provides a functional link between
AR-induced PTP1B expression and PTP1B function. Combined
with our observations in primary tumors, these results clearly
supported an AR-dependent tumor-promoting role for PTP1B
in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells.
We also examined the role of PTP1B in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. In contrast to parental LNCaP cells,
PTP1B silencing in C4-2 cells affected migration both in the
presence and absence of androgen stimulation (Fig. 6B and
Supplementary Fig. S8). Importantly, the AR remains transcriptionally active in androgen-deprived C4-2 cells (23), which
suggests that the AR-dependent regulation of PTP1B activity is
maintained in AR-expressing androgen-independent cells.
Besides, AR depletion in C4-2 cells also triggered an R1881independent increase in PTP1B levels, an event that was not
observed for the PSA gene (Fig. 1C). This indicates that in the
context of AR downregulation, other transcription factors can
substitute for the AR to promote PTP1B expression and activity
in androgen-independent cells. In line with this, PTP1B is
highly expressed in AR-negative DU145 cells and PTP1B knockdown also impaired cell migration (Fig. 6C and Supplementary

Figure 4. PTP1B and AR are coexpressed and coampliﬁed in prostate tumors. A, immunohistochemical analyses of a prostate tumor TMA showed a strong
PTP1B expression in tumor tissue (top), a strong PTP1B expression in tumor cells (middle, red arrow), and weak expression in normal glands (middle, black
arrow). Punctate staining was often observed in normal gland (bottom). B and C, expression of PTP1B is elevated in cancer tissues compared with
normal or PIN glands (B; Mann–Whitney,   , P < 0.01; Median  SD), but does not vary according to the degree of histologic differentiation (C; Gleason score).
D, Spearman correlations between PTP1B expression and the nuclear localization of AR, Ki-67, and cyclin D1 (green boxes represent P < 0.01). E,
PTPN1 ampliﬁcation is signiﬁcantly associated with metastatic (N ¼ 37) but not primary prostate tumors (N ¼ 181). It signiﬁcantly correlates with AR
ampliﬁcation (N ¼ 217), an event exclusively observed in metastatic samples. PTPN1 ampliﬁcation is also associated with a subset of genomic alterations
(cluster 5), which displays early recurrence after radical prostatectomy (19). F, PTPN1 mRNA expression in prostate cancer tumors positively correlates with
AR mRNA expression (samples with available mRNA expression data: N ¼ 150).

Fig. S8). Overall, these results showed that PTP1B exerts tumorpromoting functions in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.

Discussion
PTP1B is a well-established regulator of metabolic signaling
and has become an attractive drug target for the treatment of
diabetes and obesity (24). In these diseases, PTP1B counteracts
the action of tyrosine kinases such as the insulin receptor and
Jak2, leading to insulin resistance and attenuation of leptin
signaling, respectively (25, 26). With regard to cancer, this
inhibitory function should intuitively suppress oncogenic signaling, yet accumulating evidence suggests that PTP1B can
exert the opposite effect (27). Our results corroborate this trend
and are in line with previous studies in breast (28–30), colon
(31), and gastric cancer (32) in which PTP1B ablation and/or
inhibition abrogated the tumorigenic properties of malignant
cells. More speciﬁcally, we show here that PTP1B promotes
prostate cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and is
associated with tumor growth and metastasis in vivo (Figs. 4–6
and Supplementary Fig. S7), which is not unexpected given the
number of PTP1B substrates that play a direct role in these
processes such as FAK, CrkII, p130Cas, cortactin, and p62dok
(27). We have yet to identify the prostate-speciﬁc PTP1B
substrate(s) responsible for the observed phenotype, but prote-

1534

Cancer Res; 72(6) March 15, 2012

omic analyses are underway to characterize the phosphotyrosine substrates that differentially interact with PTP1B in
androgen-deprived and androgen-supplemented conditions
(Supplementary Fig. S4), as well as speciﬁc substrates associated with cell migration, invasion, and/or in vivo tumor
growth.
The mechanisms that modulate PTP1B activity in tumor
cells are still largely undeﬁned, but the transcriptional upregulation of PTPN1 has long been suspected. Indeed, previous
characterization of the PTPN1 promoter has identiﬁed multiple binding sites for transcription factors that are aberrantly
regulated not only in metabolic disorders but also in malignant
disease. These include Egr-1, Sp1, Sp3 (33), YB-1 (34), NF-kB
(35), and HIF (36) that can be activated by a variety of stimuli
such as glucose, insulin, proinﬂammatory cytokines, oncoproteins, or tumor suppressor loss. In addition, an increase in
PTP1B levels and/or stability has been reported in breast
cancer cells expressing a constitutively active ErbB2 mutant
(28, 37), as well as in a subset of B-cell lymphoma cell lines
following IL-4 treatment (38). Here, we show that PTPN1
transcription can also be modulated by the AR signaling axis,
a vital pathway in prostate cancer biology. We also show that
PTPN1 and AR are coampliﬁed in metastatic tumors (Fig. 4E)
and that PTP1B expression positively correlates with both
AR expression (Fig. 4F) and nuclear localization (Fig 4D).
All together, these results clearly establish PTPN1 as an

median time of onset (TD50) of 9 weeks compared with 6 weeks for shCTRL clones (Log-rank test, P < 0.05). C, weekly monitoring of tumor growth
revealed that shPTP1B tumors grow signiﬁcantly slower than the shCTRL tumors (Mann–Whitney test;   , P < 0.01).

AR-regulated gene and corroborate ﬁndings of a previous study
that reported the coampliﬁcation of PTPN1 and AR in a human
prostate cancer xenograft model (39). Interestingly, PTPN1 is
located on chromosome 20q13, a region frequently ampliﬁed in
several tumor types (40). Despite conﬂicting results that question the relevance of this ampliﬁed region in hereditary prostate cancer (41), the fact that PTPN1 is frequently ampliﬁed in
metastatic tumors as well as in a subset of high-risk primary
tumors (Fig. 4E) supports a tumor-promoting role for this
region in sporadic prostate cancer development and/or
progression.

Our high-resolution analysis of AR binding to PTPN1 is the
ﬁrst to show that PTP1B expression is not solely regulated by
transcription factors binding to the classical PTPN1 promoter
region. In R1881-stimulated LNCaP cells, direct binding of the
AR to PTPN1 occurs through 2 enhancers embedded into the
large 50.77 kb ﬁrst intron. In fact, intronic AR binding is quite
common: Hu and colleagues recently reported in a genomewide study that 49% of the AR binding sites from mouse
epididymis were intronic, most of them located within the
ﬁrst intron (42), which is also consistent with other studies in
LNCaP (22, 43), HPr-1AR (44) and primary human muscle

cells (45). Our results also indicate that other transcription
factors regulate PTP1B expression in androgen-deprived
LNCaP cells, as well as in androgen-independent cells.
In fact, AR gene expression programs have been shown to
differ between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cells (46), thus raising the possibility that alternative
factors can activate a subset of critical tumor-promoting
genes no longer regulated by the AR. This is particularly
relevant given recent discoveries showing that frequent
prostate cancer alterations, that is, constitutive PI3K signaling and TMPRSS2-ERG expression, can downregulate AR
transcriptional activity (8–10). Among potential candidates,
the aforementioned NF-kB and YB-1 factors are particularly
attractive given their established roles in prostate cancer
progression. For instance, the regulation of PTP1B by NF-kB
(35) could reconcile our ﬁndings with a previous report
linking PTP1B expression to androgen withdrawal-induced
neuroendocrine differentiation (14), an aggressive tumor
phenotype that has been associated with NF-kB activation
(47, 48). Similarly, YB-1 has been shown to be activated in
LNCaP tumors following castration (49), and a strong correlation with elevated PTP1B expression has also been
reported in androgen-independent DU145 cells (34). Finally,
given the location of their respective response elements in
the classical PTPN1 promoter region, it is also conceivable
that these factors cooperate with the AR to regulate PTPN1
transcription in low androgen conditions. In line with this, a
signiﬁcant increase in PTPN1 mRNA levels was observed in
C4-2 cells stimulated with low androgen levels (0.1 nmol/L;
Fig. 1C), a phenomenon that was not observed in parental
LNCaP cells (Fig. 1D).
In summary, our study uncovers a previously unsuspected
regulation of PTP1B by the AR and provides direct evidence for
a tumor-promoting role of PTP1B in prostate cancer. The
combination of our cellular and in vivo ﬁndings advocates for
the future preclinical testing of existing antisense or small
molecules inhibitors of PTP1B for the treatment of the disease

(50). Moreover, our initial proﬁling of androgen-induced PTPs
(Supplementary Fig. S1) justiﬁes further investigation to
address the role and signiﬁcance of other classical PTPs in
prostate cancer.
