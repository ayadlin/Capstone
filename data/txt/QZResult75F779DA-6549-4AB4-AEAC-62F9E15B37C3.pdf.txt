Abstract
The importance of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter in the
nervous system is well established, but little is yet known
about its recently described role as an autocrine and paracrine
hormone in a wide variety of nonneuronal cells. Consistent
with the expression of acetylcholine in normal lung, small
cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) synthesize and secrete acetylcholine, which acts as an autocrine growth factor through both
nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to determine if interruption of autocrine
muscarinic cholinergic signaling has potential to inhibit SCLC
growth. Muscarinic receptor (mAChR) agonists caused concentration-dependent increases in intracellular calcium and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt phosphorylation in SCLC cell lines. The inhibitory potency of mAChR
subtype–selective antagonists and small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) on acetylcholine-increased intracellular calcium
and MAPK and Akt phosphorylation was consistent with
mediation by M3 mAChR (M3R). Consistent with autocrine
acetylcholine secretion stimulating MAPK and Akt phosphorylation, M3R antagonists and M3R siRNAs alone also caused a
decrease in basal levels of MAPK and Akt phosphorylation in
SCLC cell lines. Treatment of SCLC cells with M3R antagonists
inhibited cell growth both in vitro and in vivo and also
decreased MAPK phosphorylation in tumors in nude mice
in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining of SCLC and additional
cancer types showed frequent coexpression of acetylcholine
and M3R. These findings suggest that M3R antagonists may be
useful adjuvants for treatment of SCLC and, potentially, other
cancers. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3936–44]

Introduction
Annual global lung cancer deaths exceeded 1,000,000 in the year
2000 and are expected to exceed 2,000,000 by the year 2020 or 2030
(1). Lung cancers are classified as either small cell lung carcinoma
(SCLC) or non-SCLC (NSCLC; ref. 2), with SCLC accounting for 15%
to 20% of primary lung cancer (3, 4). NSCLC accounts for the
remaining cases, with squamous cell and adenocarcinoma as the
most common types of NSCLC (2). Current therapies for SCLC

rarely extend survival beyond 5 years (3, 4); thus, novel therapeutic
approaches for SCLC therapy are needed.
Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter in the central
and peripheral nervous systems and plays key roles in learning,
memory, autonomic control, and muscular contraction. Recently, it
has been established that acetylcholine is also widely synthesized
by a variety of nonneuronal cell types, including keratinocytes (5),
airway epithelial cells (6, 7), glia (8), vascular endothelium (9, 10),
placental trophoblasts (11), and ovarian follicular cells (12) among
others (13). Expression of acetylcholine has been unambiguously
shown in these cells and tissues as shown by the presence of
choline acetyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine, and by demonstration of acetylcholine synthesis in these cells
as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
The primary functions of nonneuronal acetylcholine have not yet
been elucidated, but the expression of acetylcholine in many
different cell types suggests that its roles will be fundamental and
will present novel therapeutic targets. Our laboratory observation
that pulmonary neuroendocrine cells synthesize acetylcholine led
to our previous report that SCLC secrete acetylcholine, which acts
as an autocrine growth factor for SCLC signaling through both
nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (14). This new role for
acetylcholine suggests a potential new pathway to target tumor
growth in patients with SCLC.
Acetylcholine can stimulate cell growth through either nicotinic
cholinergic or muscarinic cholinergic pathways. The muscarinic
receptors (mAChR) are G-protein–coupled receptors, and five
subtypes of mAChR (M1–M5) have been identified. The M1, M3,
and M5 subtypes have been linked to cell proliferation and are
coupled to Gq and upon activation lead to increased levels of
intracellular IP3, diacylglycerol, and calcium ([Ca2+]I; ref. 15). The
M2 and M4 receptors are coupled to Gi and inhibit adenylyl cyclase
formation (15). Muscarinic stimulation of cancer growth has been
reported for colon (16), lung (14), glial (17), and prostate cancers
(18), and in ovarian carcinomas, expression of muscarinic receptors
correlates with a poor prognosis (19). In colon and prostate
carcinomas, tumor growth has been associated with stimulation of
M3 receptors (16, 18).
The nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChR) are ligand-gated ion
channels, and binding of acetylcholine allows entry of sodium or
calcium into the cell. Nicotine is an exogenous ligand for nAChR,
and multiple investigators have shown that activation of nAChR by
nicotine stimulates lung cancer growth (20–24). Recently, West
et al. have shown that nicotine stimulates tumor growth in NSCLC
through AKT- and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–
dependent mechanisms (20), and that modulation of Akt signaling
pathways may provide a target for directed therapy (25). Schuller

M3 Antagonists Inhibit Acetylcholine-Induced SCLC Growth

et al. have also shown that the nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)I-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) that is present in tobacco smoke
similarly stimulates lung cancer growth through nicotinic receptors
and MAPK-dependent mechanisms (23, 26). Although treatment
with nicotinic receptor antagonists can have significant effects on
blood pressure (27), muscarinic receptor antagonists are better
tolerated and are widely used for treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD; ref. 28) and overactive bladder (29). This
suggests that muscarinic antagonists might serve as a useful
adjuvant to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens for SCLC,
which express the cholinergic autocrine loop.
Here, we show that the autocrine release of acetylcholine
stimulates SCLC cell growth via M3 muscarinic mechanisms that
involve increased [Ca2+]I and increased phosphorylation of MAPK.
We also show that selective M3 antagonists can inhibit SCLC
growth both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, because multiple
other cancer types both synthesize acetylcholine and express M3
receptors, M3 antagonists may be an efficacious adjuvant therapy
in many different oncologic protocols.

Materials and Methods
SCLC cell culture and tissue samples. The classic SCLC cell lines NCI
H69, H345, H592, and H1694 and the variant SCLC cell lines H82 and H417
were generously provided by A. Gazdar et al. (30) or obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained as
previously described (14). Archival, paraffin-embedded, surgical, and
bronchoscopic biopsies of lung and other cancers were obtained from the
Department of Pathology, Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), as
approved by the OHSU Institutional Review Board for human studies.
Small interfering RNA transfection and assay. ON-TARGETplus small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for the muscarinic receptor subtypes and
negative control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO).
The siRNAs were transfected at a concentration 100 nmol/L each with
DharmaFECT 1 according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Forty-eight
hours after transfection, the cells were harvested for [Ca2+]I assay, Western
blotting analysis, and preparation of total RNA. For cell proliferation assay,
half the media was changed every 3 days for fresh media also containing the
specific or negative control siRNAs and transfection reagent.
Western blot. Immunoblotting assay was used to detect M3 mAChR and
the phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1/2) and Akt elicited by exogenous and endogenous acetylcholine. For M3
mAChR, SCLC cells were lysed, and proteins were prepared as described
previously (31). For MAPK and Akt phosphorylation, H82 cells in fresh
media were treated by adding 3  10 5 mol/L acetylcholine for 5 to 120
min. For acetylcholine dose-response curves, 1  106 H82 cells in the fresh
media were treated by adding 10 7 to 10 3 mol/L concentrations of
acetylcholine. For the concentration-dependent effects of 4-DAMP on
MAPK and Akt phosphorylation induced by exogenous acetylcholine,
1  106 H82 cells were preincubated in fresh media with 10 10 to 10 7 mol/L
4-DAMP for 30 min and then treated with 3  10 5 mol/L acetylcholine for
1 h. For the concentration-dependent effects of 4-DAMP on MAPK and Akt
phosphorylation induced by endogenous acetylcholine, 2  106 H82 cells
were incubated in fresh media 2 h and then treated with 10 11 to 10 8 mol/L
4-DAMP for 1 h. Cell pellets were washed with cold PBS and lysed by the
addition of 50 to 100 AL SDS sample buffer [62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8),
2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue]. Samples
were sonicated for 10 s, and 15 AL were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels.
After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto 0.4-Am nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk
in 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8), and 150 mmol/L NaCl. Rabbit antibodies against p44/42 MAPK,
phosphorylated p44/p42 MAPK, Akt, phosphorylated Akt (Ser473; Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and M3 mAChR (Research and
Diagnostic Antibodies, North Las Vegas, NV) were diluted by 1,000- to

www.aacrjournals.org

2,000-fold in the blocking buffer and incubated overnight with membranes at
4jC. Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin labeled with horseradish peroxidase
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was diluted 1:2,000 in the
blocking buffer and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room
temperature. Membranes were developed using the ECL Plus chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).
Acetylcholine assay. Acetylcholine secreted into media by SCLC cell
lines was assayed by HPLC coupled to an enzyme-linked electrochemical
detector as described previously (14). Aliquots of media were centrifuged,
snap frozen, and stored at 80jC. For assay, 20-AL medium was injected
directly into the HPLC. All samples were measured at least in duplicate.
Calcium fluorometry. Changes in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]I concentration elicited by cholinergic ligands in H82 were assayed using the
FLEXstation Calcium Assay kit (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). In
brief, cell suspensions were centrifuged (200  g, 2 min), and cell pellets
were resuspended in fresh medium at a cell density of 0.8  106 per mL;
100 AL of cell suspension was added to each well of poly-L-lysine–pretreated
black wall plates, and an equal volume of the loading buffer from the
Calcium Assay kit was added to each well. Plates were centrifuged at 200  g
for 4 min then incubated for 1 h at 37jC in 5% CO2, 95% room air to load
cells with the dye. Fluorescent responses to ligand were measured using a
FLEXstation (Molecular Devices) with excitation wavelength at 485 nm,
emission wavelength at 525 nm, and emission cutoff of 515 nm. All drugs
used were diluted to desired concentrations with HBSS supplemented by
20 mmol/L HEPES and 2 mmol/L CaCl2. For cholinergic agonist doseresponse curves, acetylcholine and carbachol (10 7 to 10 4 mol/L) were
applied, and fluorescence was monitored for 60 s. For antagonist studies,
4-DAMP (10 9 to 10 6 mol/L), atropine, mecamylamine, pirenzepine,
darifenacin, and AFDX 116 (10 8 to 10 5 mol/L) were used. Antagonists
were added 2 min before the addition of acetylcholine. Changes in [Ca2+]I
were calculated as a percentage of the increased fluorescent signal produced
by 10 4 mol/L cholinergic agonists for acetylcholine or carbachol doseresponse curves, or by 3 Amol/L acetylcholine in the antagonist studies.
Cell proliferation assay. H82 and H1694 cells were used to determine
which mAChR subtype mediated SCLC growth responses to endogenous
acetylcholine secretion. The M3 mAChR–selective antagonists 4-DAMP and
p-F-HHSiD, the M1 mAChR–selective antagonist pirenzepine, and the
M2/M4 mAChR–selective antagonist AFDX-116 were used to identify the
responsible muscarinic subtype. Cells were plated as described previously
(14). Drugs at final concentrations of 10 9, 10 8, 10 7, 10 6, and 10 5 mol/L
were added immediately after cell plating, and half the volume of media
plus drugs were changed every 3 days. Cell density was monitored using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium assay as previously described (14) or by measuring the
reduction of resazurin to resorufin using the Cell Titer-Blue assay (Promega
Corp., Madison, WI). Cell growth is shown as relative to values at day 0.
Nude mice studies. For tumor xenograft growth studies, mice (nu/nu;
Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were injected with SCLC
tumor cells (NCI-H82 cells) and treated with the M3 receptor antagonist
darifenacin, and tumor growth was monitored. Darifenacin was generously
provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland). Six- to 7-week-old
nude mice were housed in a pathogen-free room in microisolators with
autoclaved bedding and fed autoclaved rodent chow and water. H82 cells
were grown as described above and resuspended in fresh RPMI 1640 +
insulin, transferrin, and selenium at a concentration of 5  106 per 0.25 mL.
Cell were then mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) to give a final concentration of 5  106 per 0.5 mL, and 0.5 mL of
this cell suspension was then injected s.c. into the right flank of each mouse.
Tumors were allowed to grow for 1 week, and then drug administration was
initiated and continued for the next 4 weeks. Darifenacin was dissolved in
50% DMSO/50% PBS and administered by s.c. implanted osmotic
minipumps (Alzet model no. 2004) at doses of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/d.
Control animals received minipumps filled with 50% DMSO/50% PBS.
Tumor volume was determined weekly by measuring with calipers (volume
= height  width  depth). The study was terminated after 4 weeks of drug
administration. Ten animals were used per group. At sacrifice, tumors were
removed and weighed, and blood was collected for measurement of plasma

darifenacin concentration (32). Tumors were fixed for histologic examination, and portions were frozen for acetylcholine, RNA, and protein analyses.
Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry. Paraffin-embedded sections (5 mm) of SCLC and other tumor types were cut from tissue
blocks and stained with H&E to confirm diagnosis and tissue integrity.
Serial sections were processed for immunohistochemistry as previously
described (14). Antibodies used were mouse anti–choline acetyltransferase
(mAb 305; Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA; 1:400) and rabbit
anti–M3 mAChR (H210; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; ref. 33). All analyses also
included non-immune serum controls. Intensity of immunohistochemical
staining was scored from 0 to 4+ (where 0, no staining; 1+, focal weak
staining; 2+, focal strong staining or diffuse weak staining; 3+, diffuse
medium staining; 4+, diffuse strong staining). Dual immunohistochemical
staining was done using the same primary antibodies and donkey antimouse Alexa 488– and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 594–labeled second
antibodies from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).
Statistical analysis. In vitro cell proliferation was analyzed by two-way
ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison test using
NCSS 2002 (Kaysville, UT) statistical software. Tumor growth in nude mice
was analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by
Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison tests. Final xenograft tumor weight was
analyzed by Student’s t test. Values for EC50 and IC50 in the Calcium
fluorometry were calculated with SOFTmax Pro 4.2 (Molecular Devices).

Results
SCLC cell lines express functional M3 muscarinic receptors
and secrete acetylcholine. For mAChR to provide a therapeutic
target to block autocrine cholinergic stimulation of SCLC growth,
SCLC must express functional muscarinic receptors and secrete
acetylcholine. SCLC cell lines H69, H82, H345, H417, H592, and
H1694 were screened for expression of mAChR by PCR, and all cell
lines expressed all five subtypes of mAChR (data not shown). Next,
fluorometry was used to identify the muscarinic receptor subtype
mediating acetylcholine-induced increases in intracellular calcium.
As shown in Fig. 1A, acetylcholine and carbachol caused a

concentration-dependent increase of [Ca2+]I in H82 cells, with
EC50 of 0.47 and 2.78 Amol/L, respectively. As low as 10 7 mol/L
acetylcholine induced 20% of maximal response in H82 cells; 10 7
mol/L of the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine completely blocked the response of H82 cells to 10 5.5 mol/L
acetylcholine, showing that the effect of acetylcholine on [Ca2+]I
was mediated by mAChR (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, 4-DAMP
(a selective M3 mAChR antagonist), pirenzepine (a selective M1
mAChR antagonist), and ADFX 116 (a selective M2/M4 mAChR
antagonist) each caused the concentration-dependent inhibition of
the [Ca2+]I increase elicited by acetylcholine in H82 cells. The
inhibitory potency order was 4-DAMP > pirenzepine > AFDX 116,
consistent with mediation of the effects of acetylcholine on [Ca2+]I
by the M3 mAChR. A second M3-selective mAChR antagonist
(darifenacin) also completely inhibited the acetylcholine-induced
increase in [Ca2+]I (data not shown). Similar results were obtained
in a second SCLC cell line (H1694; data not shown). The role of M3
receptors in mediating the effect of acetylcholine on [Ca2+]I was
confirmed by siRNA knockdown. Transfection of siRNAs against
the M1, M3, and M5 muscarinic receptors all knocked down their
target RNAs by >60% (data not shown), but only knockdown of the
M3 mAChR RNA blocked the acetylcholine induced increase in
[Ca2+]I (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of
M3 mAChR in H82 and H1694 cells showing a single band of
70 kDa as expected (ref. 31; data not shown).
Completing the cholinergic autocrine loop, as we have previously
reported, H82 cells synthesize and secrete acetylcholine (14). In
addition, four of five other SCLC cell lines examined (H69, H345,
H592, and H1694) synthesized acetylcholine with average secretion
of 41.5 F 1.5 pmol per 5  105 cells per 24 h. No acetylcholine
secretion was detectable from the H417 SCLC cell line.
M3-selective mAChR antagonists inhibit SCLC cell proliferation in vitro. Next, the ability of M3 muscarinic antagonists to

Figure 2. Regulation of H82 cell proliferation by mAChR subtype antagonists.
H82 cells were plated and treated as described in Materials and Methods.
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium assay was used to detect H82 cell growth after treatment with
4-DAMP, P-F-HHSiD (M3 mAChR antagonists), AFDX-116 (M2/M4 mAChR
antagonist), and pirenzepine (M1 mAChR antagonist). A, the M3 mAChR
antagonist 4-DAMP inhibited H82 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent
manner. B, the less potent M3 mAChR antagonist P-F-HHSiD only significantly
inhibited H82 cell proliferation at a concentration of 10 5 mol/L. C, the
M1-selective mAChR antagonist pirenzepine had no significant effect on cell

block growth of SCLC cell lines in vitro was determined. As shown
in Fig. 2A and B, the selective M3 mAChR antagonists 4-DAMP and
p-F-HHSiD both significantly inhibited H82 cell proliferation at
9 days, whereas the selective M1 antagonist pirenzepine and the
M2/M4–selective antagonist AFDX-116 had no effects on cell
proliferation (Fig. 2C and D). 4-DAMP showed a dose-dependent
inhibition of cell growth, and consistent with the lower potency of
p-F-HHSiD compared with 4-DAMP, p-F-HHSiD inhibited cell
growth only at the highest concentration tested. The M3-selective
antagonist darifenacin also showed significant inhibition of H82
cell growth at concentrations of 10 6 and 10 7 mol/L (data not
shown). Similar results were also obtained for the inhibition of
growth in the H1694 SCLC cell line by muscarinic antagonists (data
not shown). Because the only source of ligand for the M3 receptor
in these studies was endogenously released acetylcholine, this
suggests that in SCLC cell lines, endogenous acetylcholine
functions as an autocrine growth factor signaling in part through
activation of M3 mAChR.
Exogenous and endogenous acetylcholine stimulate phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt in SCLC cell lines. The potential
role of MAPK and Akt in mediating the effects of autocrine
acetylcholine secretion on growth of H82 cells was evaluated by
measuring acetylcholine-induced phosphorylation. As shown in
Fig. 3A, acetylcholine induced a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt. Phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK

www.aacrjournals.org

induced by acetylcholine was most potently blocked by the
selective M3 receptor antagonist 4-DAMP (Fig. 3B). M1 and M2/
M4 antagonists were less potent in blocking phosphorylation (data
not shown). Thus, acetylcholine-induced phosphorylation of MAPK
and Akt is mediated in part by M3 mAChR. However, if autocrine
acetylcholine secretion regulates basal phosphorylation of MAPK
and Akt, then addition of M3 antagonists alone should decrease
MAPK and Akt phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3C and D,
addition of 4-DAMP to H82 cells inhibited MAPK and Akt
phosphorylation in a dose-wise manner, indicating that autocrine
acetylcholine secretion regulates basal phosphorylation of MAPK
and Akt in SCLC. Effects were more pronounced on MAPK than
AKT. Similar results were also seen with H1649 cells (data not
shown). Specific knockdown of M3 mACh RNA with siRNAs
similarly blocked basal phosphorylation of MAPK and lead to
decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 3E), thus confirming the role of
M3 receptors.
The M3 receptor antagonist darifenacin inhibits SCLC
xenograft growth and MAPK phosphorylation in vivo in nude
mice. If autocrine acetylcholine secretion has a regulatory role on
tumor growth, then M3 antagonists should inhibit tumor growth in
nude mice xenografts. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, consistent with
the effects of M3 receptor antagonists in vitro, the M3-selective
receptor darifenacin significantly inhibited H82 tumor growth in a
dose-wise manner. Darifenacin was used because of its in vivo
stability and high degree of M3 selectivity. No significant effects of
darifenacin treatment on overall animal weight were observed. As
shown in Fig. 4C, significant inhibition of tumor growth were
achieved at a plasma concentration of 9.4 F 0.3 ng/mL (f2.5 
10 8 mol/L), which is a concentration achieved with clinical use of
darifenacin for overactive bladder (32).
Consistent with the in vitro effects of M3 antagonists, levels of
MAPK phosphorylation in the tumors removed from the
darifenacin treated mice were significantly decreased (Fig. 4D),
whereas no significant effects were seen on Akt phosphorylation
(Fig. 4D). Acetylcholine content of control tumor samples was
420 F 110 pmol/g, which corresponds to 4  10 7 mol/L, assuming
uniform distribution in the tumor. Based on the responses shown
in Fig. 3, these levels of acetylcholine are high enough to increase
MAPK phosphorylation. Histologically, cells in tumors from nude
mice treated with the highest dose of darifenacin were larger, with
increased cytoplasm and less nuclear molding compared with
controls consistent with slower proliferation.
Coexpression of choline acetyltransferase and M3 mAChR
subtype in SCLC and other cancers. The above data show that in
SCLC cell lines that both synthesize acetylcholine and express M3
receptors, M3 receptor antagonists and siRNA can inhibit cell
proliferation. To determine the frequency of SCLC that both
synthesize acetylcholine and express M3 receptors, a panel of
archival SCLC specimens was screened for coexpression of M3
mAChR and choline acetyltransferase, the enzyme necessary for
acetylcholine synthesis. In a series of 24 SCLC tumors, 17 of 24
(70%) tumors expressed M3 receptor immunoreactivity with an
average intensity of 1.2 of 4 as described in Materials and Methods
(Table 1). In addition, all 17 of the SCLC that expressed M3 also
expressed choline acetyltransferase, with average immunostaining
intensity of 1.4 of 4 (Table 1). Thus, 70% of the SCLC screened
expressed both choline acetyltransferase and M3R, suggesting that
M3 receptor antagonists could inhibit the growth of the majority of
SCLC. Representative staining of choline acetyltransferase and M3
in SCLC is shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5C, individual tumor

cells coexpress M3R and choline acetyltransferase. Specificity of
staining is shown in Fig. 5D, which shows an example of a SCLC
tumor that did not express choline acetyltransferase.
Previous studies from our laboratory and other laboratories have
shown that acetylcholine and M3 receptors are expressed in a wide
variety of normal endothelial and epithelial cell types (5–13). This
suggests that cancers derived from these diverse cell types will
similarly coexpress acetylcholine and M3 receptors. As shown in
Table 1, this is the case for NSCLC in which coexpression of choline
acetyltransferase and M3 receptors occurs in 70% of bronchoalveolar lung carcinoma and 45% of squamous cell carcinoma of the
lung. Coexpression of acetylcholine and M3 receptors is not limited
to lung cancers, as 50% of pancreatic carcinoma and 43% of
cervical carcinoma also show such coexpression (Table 1).

Discussion
Autocrine and paracrine secretion of acetylcholine by nonneuronal cells represents a new paradigm for the physiologic and
pathologic functions of acetylcholine. The role of acetylcholine as a
neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system is a
bedrock of neuroscience, but essentially nothing is known of the
role of nonneuronal acetylcholine and the therapeutic opportuni-

ties this new pathway may provide. Currently, there is intense
research on inhibition of proliferative tyrosine kinases in the
treatment of many cancers, and blocking autocrine cholinergic
signaling may provide a directed upstream approach to blocking
proliferative pathway phosphorylation. In this study, we have now
shown that autocrine secretion of acetylcholine by SCLC plays a
role in maintaining basal phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK, and
that widely prescribed M3 mAChR antagonists (28, 29) can
decrease Akt and MAPK phosphorylation and concomitantly
decrease tumor growth.
Evaluation by PCR showed that all five muscarinic receptor
subtypes are present in all SCLC cell lines we have examined to
date. Studies in diverse cell types have shown that muscarinic
receptor activation is associated with cell proliferation, and this
seems to be linked to increases in intracellular calcium mediated
by the M1, M3, and M5 receptors, which are linked to Gq. In SCLC,
Fucile et al. (34) and Beekman et al. (35) have shown the
importance of Gq- and calcium-linked signaling in stimulation of
tumor growth. Consistent with this, muscarinic agonists increased
[Ca2+]I in SCLC (Fig. 1). Antagonist studies suggested this increase
in [Ca2+]I was mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors, and this
finding was confirmed using three different M3 antagonists. In
addition, siRNA was used to confirm the role of the M3 receptor.

Sample size of each series as shown (N).

Knockdown of the M1 and M5 mAChR receptors had no effect on
the acetylcholine-induced increase in [Ca2+]I, whereas knockdown
of the M3 receptor almost completely blocked the calcium
response.
For the cholinergic autocrine loop to be present, cells must also
express acetylcholine, the ligand for the M3 mAChR. Five of six
SCLC cell lines examined here synthesized and secreted acetylcholine. This is consistent with the reports that acetylcholine is
synthesized and secreted by nonneuronal cell types, including
airway epithelial cells (7, 36), vessel endothelial cells (37),
lymphocytes (38), ovarian granulosa cells (39), and placenta (40).
During a 24-h incubation, >100 pmol of acetylcholine were secreted

by 5  105 H82 cells, and the acetylcholine concentration in the
medium reached 150 nmol/L, a concentration sufficient to trigger
[Ca2+]I increase in SCLC cells (Fig. 1). In the local environment of
tumors, concentrations of acetylcholine at surface receptors may
be even higher due to high cell densities in solid masses, proximity
of secretion events to receptor location, and variations in
cholinesterase levels. It has also been reported that levels of
circulating cholinesterase is reduced in cancer patients (41), and
decreased levels of cholinesterase in NSCLC has been reported by
Martinez-Moreno et al. (42), with the implication that cholinergic
signaling may be further increased in tumors due to decreased
cholinesterase activity.
If acetylcholine secreted by SCLC stimulates tumor growth
through M3 muscarinic mechanisms, the addition of M3 mAChR
antagonists should inhibit SCLC growth. As shown in Fig. 2, this is
so, and the M3-selective antagonists 4-DAMP, p-F-HHSiD, and
darifenacin significantly inhibited SCLC growth in vitro, whereas
the M1 antagonist pirenzepine and the M2/M4 antagonist AFDX116 had no significant effect. As shown in Fig. 3, the M3 mAChR
antagonists also inhibited acetylcholine-induced phosphorylation
of MAPK and Akt in H82 cells. As for inhibition of cell proliferation,
the rank order potency of mAChR antagonists to block MAPK
and Akt phosphorylation by acetylcholine in H82 cells was
4-DAMP > pirenzepine > AFDX 116. This suggests that M3
receptors may mediate the effects of autocrine acetylcholine on
cell proliferation through stimulation of phosphorylation of MAPK
and Akt. Knockdown of the M3 receptor with siRNAs confirmed
this, causing similar decreases in both basal phosphorylation of
MAPK and SCLC growth in vitro (Fig. 3E) as did the selective M3
antagonists.
These findings are consistent with studies of muscarinic stimulation of tumor growth in multiple cancer types. Fucile et al. (34)

have similarly reported muscarinic stimulation of SCLC cell
growth. M3 receptors have also been shown to mediate growth
in prostate carcinoma cell lines (18) and gastric carcinoma cell
lines (43). Frucht et al. (44), Cheng et al. (16), and Ukegawa et al.
(45) have all shown that acetylcholine stimulates proliferation of
colon carcinoma cell lines through M3-dependent phosphorylation
of MAPK pathways. In astrocytoma cells, M3 receptors also
stimulate growth through the Akt and MAPK pathways (46, 47),
and cholinergic stimulation stimulates proliferation of breast
cancer cells through MAPK (48). Acetylcholine expression has
been shown in the ovary (39), and the expression of muscarinic
receptors in ovarian cancer correlates with decreased survival (19).
Thus, these studies are in concordance with our finding that
acetylcholine stimulates lung cancer growth through M3 mAChR
linked to MAPK phosphorylation.
These findings raise the question whether autocrine acetylcholine secretion from lung cancer cells plays a role in maintaining
basal phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt in tumor cells. This
seems to be the case because as shown in Fig. 3C and D, the M3
antagonist 4-DAMP decreases basal phosphorylation of Akt and
MAPK in H82 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, West
et al. have shown that the interaction of nicotine with nicotinic
receptors also leads to increased Akt (20); thus, acetylcholine
secreted by lung tumors may also stimulate Akt and MAPK
phosphorylation through interaction with nicotinic receptors.
Other paracrine sources of acetylcholine, such as airway
epithelium (6, 7), may also be important especially in smaller

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

tumors. Indeed, Reinheimer et al. (6) has measured acetylcholine
content of human bronchi of 2,500 pmol/g, which assuming a
uniform distribution, would correspond to a concentration of
2.5  10 6 mol/L. Based on the data shown in Figs. 1 and 3, this
would be enough to increase intracellular calcium and stimulate
MAPK phosphorylation. The implication of this is that in smokers
with lung cancer, cholinergic-mediated proliferative pathways will
be stimulated both by exogenous nicotine and from endogenous
acetylcholine. Furthermore, as nicotine has been shown to upregulate levels of its receptor (49), the interaction between
exogenous and endogenous cholinergic stimulation is likely to be
synergistic with significant potential to lead to cellular hyperplasia/proliferation and phenotypic progression (20, 50). Finally,
Schuller et al. (23, 26) have shown that the carcinogen NNK
present in cigarette smoke also signals through nicotinic
pathways to activate MAPK in lung cancers to further synergize
with endogenous cholinergic signaling.
An important finding of this study is that M3 mAChR
antagonists inhibit SCLC growth in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4,
growth of the SCLC H82 cell line was inhibited by the M3
antagonist darifenacin in xenografts in nude mice. This confirms
that tumor secretion of acetylcholine in vivo stimulates SCLC
tumor growth, and that M3 receptor antagonists can block
autocrine cholinergic stimulation of tumor growth. As shown in
Fig. 4C, inhibition of tumor growth was achieved at plasma
darifenacin concentrations between 3 and 10 ng/mL, which are in
the range of plasma concentration obtained with clinical use of

M3 Antagonists Inhibit Acetylcholine-Induced SCLC Growth

darifenacin (32). Thus, inhibition of SCLC growth can be achieved
at clinically relevant doses of M3 receptor antagonists.
As shown in Fig. 4, inhibition of tumor growth in vivo was
associated with inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation within the
tumor, whereas Akt phosphorylation was not inhibited. This
suggests that in vivo, autocrine acetylcholine signals proliferation
primarily through the MAPK pathway, and that there are other
factors within serum or the tumor that stimulate Akt phosphorylation. This suggests that a combination regimen of Akt inhibitors
and M3 receptor antagonists may be effective in inhibiting tumor
growth, especially in smokers in whom nicotine has been shown to
activate Akt proliferative pathways (20, 50).
As discussed above, activation of M3 mAChR stimulates growth
in multiple tumor types. Thus, if the many tumors that express M3
receptors also synthesize acetylcholine, the cholinergic autocrine
loop may be wide spread in cancers. In our study, screening of
archival tumor samples showed that expression of the M3
muscarinic cholinergic autocrine loop is widespread in SCLC.
Seventeen of 24 SCLC examined expressed M3 receptors, and all
tumors that expressed M3 receptors also expressed choline
acetyltransferase. In addition, the widespread expression of
acetylcholine and M3 receptors in nonneuronal cells suggests the
autocrine cholinergic loop may occur in other tumor types besides
SCLC. This is supported by the data shown in Table 1, with
significant expression of choline acetyltransferase and M3 receptors in squamous cell lung carcinoma, bronchoalveolar lung
carcinoma, and in two non-lung carcinoma types as well. Although

we have not looked at the proliferative responses of cancer types
other than SCLC to acetylcholine, data on the effects of M3
activation on growth of a variety of cancers types (16, 18, 43–48)
suggest that M3 receptor antagonists will also inhibit growth of
other cancer types that similarly both synthesize acetylcholine and
express M3 receptors. Identification of which cancer types can be
inhibited by M3 receptor antagonists and what criteria are
necessary to identify the subset of tumors that will respond to
M3 antagonists remains to be determined.
M3 receptor antagonists are widely used for treatment of COPD
and overactive bladder. Thus, clinical trials to determine the
usefulness of M3 antagonists as adjuvants to existing cancer
therapy for SCLC and other cancer types may be warranted.
Although M3 mAChR antagonists are unlikely to be a primary
therapy, in combination with existing therapies they may have
potential to slow tumor growth with minimal side effects.
