Abstract
Cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) phosphatase controls entry
into mitosis and regulates recovery from G2-M checkpointinduced arrest. In the present study, we show that exposure of
diploid mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) to the ultimate
carcinogen anti-benzo(a)pyrene (BP)-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide
(anti-BPDE) resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent
increase in Cdc25B protein levels. Chronic exposure of wildtype (Cdc25B+/+) MEFs to anti-BPDE (0.1 Mmol/L) caused
neoplastic transformation characterized by colony formation
in culture and tumor production in nude mice. In contrast, the
Cdc25B null MEFs were resistant to anti-BPDE–induced
transformation. Furthermore, a carcinogenic dose of the
parent hydrocarbon (BP) increased Cdc25B protein levels in
the target organ, lung. The biological importance of elevated
Cdc25B levels was documented by the early reentry into
mitosis of cells overexpressing ectopic Cdc25B levels even in
the presence of DNA damage following anti-BPDE exposure,
whereas control cells resumed only after DNA damage was
repaired. We conclude that Cdc25B has an essential role in
anti-BPDE–induced neoplastic transformation, including
regulation of cell cycle resumption in the presence of DNA
damage. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9150–7]

Introduction
Benzo(a)pyrene (BP) is the prototype of the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon family of environmental pollutants that are tumorigenic in experimental animals and suspected human carcinogens
(1). The tumorigenic activity of BP has been attributed to its
metabolite BP-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (anti-BPDE), which is formed
via epoxidation and hydration reactions catalyzed by cytochrome
P450–dependent monooxygenases and epoxide hydrolase, respectively (2–5). Anti-BPDE is highly reactive toward cellular nucleophiles, including DNA and glutathione (6, 7). Covalent interaction
of the epoxide functional group of anti-BPDE with exocyclic amino
groups of the purine bases in DNA is considered a critical reaction
in the initiation of anti-BPDE–induced cancers (7).

Cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) is a dual-specificity phosphatase
that plays pivotal role in controlling cell cycle progression by
catalyzing removal of covalently attached contiguous phosphates
and the subsequent activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1;
ref. 8). Among the Cdc25 family members, Cdc25B has been
proposed to regulate reentry into mitosis after DNA damage (8–10).
Importantly, Cdc25B is oncogenic (11) and its overexpression has
been documented in a variety of human cancers, including head
and neck, colon, and non–small cell lung cancer (12–14). Cdc25B
also interacts with the steroid receptors (15), suggesting that some
Cdk-independent sites might contribute to the oncogenic potential
of Cdc25B. In addition, transgenic mice that overexpress Cdc25B
in mammary epithelium exhibit mammary gland hyperplasia and
increased susceptibility to 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene–
induced mammary tumorigenesis (16, 17).
We showed previously that anti-BPDE exposure of lung cancer
cells and terminal squamous differentiated human bronchial
epithelial cells, but not undifferentiated bronchial epithelial cells,
resulted in induction of Cdc25B protein expression (18). In
addition, the growth rate of lung cancer cells increased significantly
compared with untreated cells following chronic exposure to antiBPDE (18). In the present study, we markedly extended these
findings by showing that Cdc25B was essential for anti-BPDE–
induced neoplastic transformation using diploid mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEF) from wild-type (WT; Cdc25B+/+) and Cdc25B null
mice (Cdc25B / ). We also provide evidence that Cdc25B could
promote tumorigenesis by accelerating the kinetics of cell cycle
resumption even in the presence of DNA damage following
anti-BPDE treatment.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Diploid MEFs derived from WT and Cdc25B null mice were
generously provided by Dr. Peter J. Donovan (University of California, Irvine,
CA; ref. 19). Normal male diploid CCL-202 human lung fibroblasts were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. BP and its metabolites
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Chemical Carcinogen
Reference Standard Repository. Gö6976 was purchased from EMD
Biosciences. The antibody against Cdc25B, which has been extensively
validated by us (20), was from Transduction Laboratories. Other antibodies
used were as follows: anti–Tyr15 Cdk1 and anti–checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1;
Sigma-Aldrich Co.); anti-actin, p53, and p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
anti–histone H3 (Ser10; Upstate Biotechnology); and anti-Chk1 (Ser317), p53
(Ser15), and gH2AX (Cell Signaling Technology). Six- to 8-week-old female
athymic mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, whereas 6- to
8-week-old female A/J mice were procured from the National Cancer
Institute (Frederick, MD).
Cell culture and immunoblotting methods. WT diploid MEF and
Cdc25B null MEFs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and antibiotics at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. CCL-202 cells were

maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10%
FBS and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. The MEFs were exposed to the desired
concentration of anti-BPDE, BP, BP-7,8-diol, or BP-7,8,9,10-tetrol for the
indicated times. Stock solutions of BP and its metabolites were prepared
in DMSO, and an equal volume of DMSO was added to the controls.
Treated and control MEFs were harvested using EDTA-trypsin, washed
with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with a solution containing 50 mmol/L Tris,
1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, 2 mmol/L
EGTA, 12 mmol/L h-glycerol phosphate, 10 mmol/L NaF, 16 Ag/mL
benzamidine-HCl, 10 Ag/mL phenanthroline, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL
leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL pepstatin, and 1 nmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.
After a 30-min incubation on ice, the cell lysate was cleared by
centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Equal amounts of lysate proteins
were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described by
us previously (18).
Transformation assay. WT as well as Cdc25B null MEFs (f2  104)
were seeded in T25 flasks and allowed to attach overnight. The medium was
replaced with fresh complete medium containing 0.1 Amol/L anti-BPDE or
an equal volume of DMSO. Three separate cultures of both types of MEFs
were independently exposed to anti-BPDE or DMSO. After a 48-h incubation
at 37jC, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium without
anti-BPDE or DMSO and the fibroblasts were allowed to attain 70% to 80%
confluency. The MEFs were harvested by trypsin treatment, reseeded, and
exposed again to anti-BPDE or DMSO as described above. This treatment
protocol was repeated four times over a period of 4 weeks. After the fourth
exposure, a change in morphology was noticed for anti-BPDE–exposed WT
MEFs. At this stage, anti-BPDE and DMSO treatments were stopped.
Colony formation assay. The anchorage-independent growth of MEFs
was determined by colony formation efficiency in soft agar. Approximately
3,000 DMSO- or BPDE-treated MEFs were mixed at 37jC with 2 mL of 0.33%
(w/v) soft agar (Sigma-Aldrich) and then poured onto a layer of previously
set 2 mL of 0.9% soft agar (w/v) in six-well tissue culture plates. The soft
agar suspensions were prepared in the complete DMEM. Cells were
incubated for 2 weeks and then the growth of colonies was observed under
an inverted microscope (Zeiss Thornwood) at 10 magnification.
Cell cycle resumption and DNA damage studies. U2OS cells
expressing HA-Cdc25B3 under a tetracycline (Tet)–regulated promoter
(a gift from Prof. Bernard Ducommun, Université Paul Sabatier, Toulouse,
France) were maintained in DMEM constituted with 10% FBS, 100 Ag/mL
G418, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 Ag/mL Tet as described previously
(10). Cells were plated 24 h before inducing Cdc25B for 16 h by removing
Tet. Control cells were cultured in the presence of Tet to suppress ectopic
Cdc25B expression. We then examined mitotic reentry of asynchronous cell
populations treated with 100 nmol/L anti-BPDE. Cells were either harvested
0 to 24 h after anti-BPDE treatment in cold lysis buffer for immunoblotting,
as described above, or fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for flow cytometry.
Induction of DNA damage in the presence of elevated levels of Cdc25B was
examined by immunoblotting for phosphorylated gH2AX, p53, and Chk1.
For flow cytometry analysis, cells were fixed overnight, washed with PBS
containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and permeabilized with PBS
containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 8 min on ice. Following washing, cells
were then incubated for 2 h with 1 Ag anti–phospho-Ser10-histone H3, a
well-accepted marker of mitosis. Cells were washed an additional time
before incubating with antirabbit IgG-Alexa 488 (1:75) for 40 min in the
dark. Finally, cells were washed again and resuspended in 500 AL propidium
iodide for 15 min before flow cytometry analysis.
Animal experiments. For tumor xenograft assay, anti-BPDE– or DMSOexposed WT or Cdc25B null MEFs (106 cells) were s.c. injected into the right
flank of athymic mice ( four mice per group). Animals of each group were
monitored thrice weekly for the appearance of tumors. Single tumors were
formed and the tumor volume was calculated as described previously (21).
To determine in vivo effect of BP administration on pulmonary and hepatic
Cdc25B protein level, we fed female A/J mice an AIN-76 semipurified (ICN)
diet for 1 week before treatment. Mice were divided into two groups of
12 mice per group. The experimental group of mice was p.o. gavaged with
2 mg BP in 0.1 mL corn oil, whereas the control animals received an equal
volume of corn oil alone. Four mice from both groups were sacrificed at

6, 12, and or 24 h after BP or corn oil administration. Lung and liver tissues
were collected, washed with ice-cold PBS, and stored at 80jC until
processed for immunoblotting.

Results
Anti-BPDE increases Cdc25B protein levels. To determine
whether anti-BPDE altered Cdc25B levels in MEFs, we treated WT
MEFs with various concentrations of anti-BPDE. As shown in
Fig. 1A, we noted a concentration-dependent induction of Cdc25B
with a 4-fold increase at 5 and 10 Amol/L anti-BPDE. In time
course studies using 10 Amol/L anti-BPDE (Fig. 1B), the induction
of Cdc25B protein level was evident as early as 4 h after treatment
and persisted for the duration of the experiment (24 h after
treatment). We saw no significant cytotoxicity when MEFs were
treated for 24 h with 10 Amol/L anti-BPDE consistent with our
previous observations with 128-88T and A549 cells (18). In
agreement with the known function of Cdc25B in catalyzing
dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 of Cdk1 (8), anti-BPDE–
mediated induction of Cdc25B protein was accompanied by a
sharp decline in the level of Tyr15 Cdk1 (Fig. 1B) similar to terminal
squamous differentiated bronchial epithelial cells and lung cancer

mation. Using previously described MEFs from WT and Cdc25B
null mice (19), we observed that the WT MEFs began to form
colonies of rounded cells after repeated exposures to 0.1 Amol/L
anti-BPDE over a period of 4 weeks (Fig. 3A, III). Similar results
were seen in three separate cultures of the WT MEFs that were
exposed to anti-BPDE. In contrast, anti-BPDE treatment of Cdc25B
null MEFs did not cause a visible change in their morphology
(Fig. 3A, IV ). The fibroblast-like morphology was also maintained
when either the WT or the Cdc25B null MEFs were chronically

cells (18). Next, we addressed whether induction of Cdc25B protein
was unique to anti-BPDE by determining the effects of parent
hydrocarbon (BP), BP-7,8-diol (precursor of anti-BPDE), and
BP-7,8,9,10-tetrol (hydrolysis product of anti-BPDE) on Cdc25B
protein level by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Unlike anti-BPDE, Cdc25B
levels were marginally increased by treatment of MEFs with BP-7,8diol or seemed to be decreased by either BP or BP-7,8,9,10-tetrol
(Fig. 2). The decrease in Cdc25B was unexpected and requires
additional studies to explain. Nonetheless, these results suggested
that the epoxide functional group of anti-BPDE was required for
inducing Cdc25B protein levels.
Cdc25B is essential for anti-BPDE–induced tumorigenesis.
We next determined the potential functional significance of
Cdc25B induction after anti-BPDE treatment. We postulated that
if Cdc25B induction was important in anti-BPDE–induced
neoplasia, it might affect anti-BPDE–induced neoplastic transfor-

exposed to DMSO (Fig. 3A, compare I and II). To confirm the role
of Cdc25B in anti-BPDE–induced transformation, we plated
DMSO- or anti-BPDE–treated WT and Cdc25B null MEFs in soft
agar and observed colony formation 2 weeks later. As shown in the
Supplementary Fig. S1 (I–IV ), only anti-BPDE–treated WT MEFs
formed colonies. These results substantiate that Cdc25B has an
important role in anti-BPDE–induced transformation.
To confirm the transformed phenotype in vivo, we s.c. injected
athymic mice with the anti-BPDE–exposed WT MEFs. As seen in
Fig. 3B (II), the anti-BPDE–exposed WT MEFs produced tumors
after s.c. injection in nude mice. Tumors were observed in each of
the four mice that were injected with anti-BPDE–exposed WT
MEFs. Figure 3C depicts the growth curve for tumors resulting
from s.c. injection of anti-BPDE–exposed WT MEFs. In contrast,
the anti-BPDE–exposed Cdc25B null MEFs failed to produce
tumors in nude mice (compare IV of Fig. 3B for a representative
mouse of this group). The DMSO-exposed MEFs of both types
(WT and Cdc25B null) were also nontumorigenic in nude mice
(Fig. 3B, I and III, respectively).
BP administration increases pulmonary Cdc25B in vivo. To
further test the hypothesis that the anti-BPDE induction of Cdc25B
protein was biologically relevant, we examined the in vivo effect of
BP administration to mice on Cdc25B protein content in the lung,
which is a target organ for BP-induced cancer in mice. Female A/J
mice, a strain sensitive to BP-induced pulmonary tumorigenesis
(22), were p.o. treated with a carcinogenic dose of BP or an equal
volume of the corn oil (vehicle for BP). Four mice from both groups
were sacrificed at different time intervals, and the lungs and livers
were collected and processed for Cdc25B immunoblotting (Fig. 4).
Densitometric scanning of the Cdc25B immunoreactive bands
followed by normalization to loading control (actin) revealed that
24 h after BP administration, there was a significant increase in
pulmonary Cdc25B, which was accompanied by decrease in the
level of Tyr15 Cdk1 at 24 h after BP (Fig. 4A). In contrast, hepatic
Cdc25B protein level was unaffected by BP administration (data
not shown), as would be predicted by the lack of BP-induced
hepatocarcinogenesis in this mouse model. As shown in Fig. 4B,

www.aacrjournals.org

Cdc25B was also induced in normal diploid human lung fibroblasts
(CCL-202) when treated with anti-BPDE (10 Amol/L) in a timedependent manner.
Cdc25B induction involves the Chk1 pathway. Recently, we
have observed that UV irradiation increases Cdc25B protein levels
by activating ATR/Chk1 pathway potentially via post-transcriptional mechanism (20). Similarly, in recent studies, it was shown
that replication fork stalled by anti-BPDE–adducted DNA activates
ATR/Chk1 (23, 24). To test the hypothesis that anti-BPDE increases
Cdc25B by activating Chk1, we first confirmed Chk1 activation in
CCL-202 cells following anti-BPDE treatment (data not shown). To
block Chk1 activation, we pretreated cells with Gö6976 (1 Amol/L)
for 30 min followed by anti-BPDE treatment (1 Amol/L) for an
additional 1 h. As shown in Fig. 4B, pretreatment with Chk1
inhibitor Gö6976 (25) blocked the increase in Cdc25B protein
levels.
Cdc25B regulates recovery in the presence of DNA damage.
Cdc25B has been identified recently to have a crucial role in the
cell cycle resumption following DNA damage (9, 10) and this
process might enable cells to survive genotoxic stress. A disruption
in the presumptive protective pathway could contribute to tumor
development by permitting cell division without completion of
DNA repair. We therefore postulated that BPDE-induced transformation might be linked to Cdc25B induction and the subsequent
promotion of cell cycle resumption in the presence of DNA
damage. To test this hypothesis, we first examined mitotic reentry
in asynchronous cell populations with differing levels of Cdc25B
(22) after exposure to anti-BPDE (100 nmol/L). Tet was removed
from U2OS cells for 16 h to induce Cdc25B expression before antiBPDE treatment. Using histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation as a
marker of mitotic reentry, we found that both control and
Cdc25B-overexpressing U2OS cells initially activate a G2-M
checkpoint as shown by the reduction in the percentage of
mitotic cells at 2 h after treatment. The relative mitotic ratio of
anti-BPDE–treated control cells was 0.77 F 0.06%, which was
similar to the anti-BPDE–treated Cdc25B-overexpressing cells
(0.71 F 0.11%; Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, 12 h after anti-BPDE

treatment, there was a pronounced inhibition of mitotic reentry in
cells with suppressed ectopic Cdc25B (+Tet; 0.19 F 0.01%), whereas
Cdc25B-overexpressing U2SO cells ( Tet) had a higher mitotic
ratio (0.46 F 0.08%). Twenty-four hours after treatment, Cdc25Boverexpressing cells ( Tet) were fully recovered as indicated by
percentage of mitotic cells of 1.16 F 0.06%, whereas control cells
populations (+Tet) continued to restrict cellular entry into mitosis
(0.53 F 0.04%). Furthermore, based on the DNA profile of cells at
12 h compared with 0 and 2 h, DMSO-treated cell progressed
through cell cycle as indicated by increase in the number of cells in
G2 phase. Cell cycle progression of anti-BPDE–treated cells was
delayed with a majority of cells in S phase (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Additionally, 24 h after anti-BPDE treatment, 47.9 F 3.6% of
control cells and 40.5 F 1.8% of Cdc25B-overexpressing cells were
in G2-M phase, indicating cell progression from S phase at 12 h. In
contrast, DMSO-treated cells potentially divided between 12 and
24 h as indicated by increased percentage of cells in G1 (29.6 F
2.0% of control cells and 19.7 F 0.7% of Cdc25B-overexpressing
cells), suggesting that anti-BPDE–treated cells were delayed in cell
cycle compared with DMSO-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 5C,
treatment with anti-BPDE caused DNA damage within 2 h after
treatment indicated by gH2AX phosphorylation. The intensity of
gH2AX phosphorylation increased with time (4 and 8 h) in BPDEtreated samples. Cell populations that maintained high ectopic
Cdc25B levels displayed prolonged gH2AX irrespective of exposure
to anti-BPDE. It is noteworthy that Cdc25B-overexpressing cells
treated with anti-BPDE resumed cell cycle progression despite this
apparent DNA damage.
Cdc25B induction deregulates checkpoints. Recent studies
have shown that in early precursor lesions, activated oncogenes,
such as Cdc25A, cyclin E, Cdc6, and E2F, could aberrantly regulate
cell cycle progression, thus causing replication stress and DNA
damage, which potentially activates checkpoint response, including
phosphorylated ATM, Chk2, phosphorylated gH2AX, and p53
(26, 27). Activation of checkpoints thus leads to cell death or
senescence, thereby preventing tumor progression, but the
development of defects in the checkpoint response could lead to
genetic instability. The exact mechanism by which the defects in
the checkpoint response are accumulated is not completely
understood but one mechanism may be selection pressure induced
by activated oncogenes. Because overexpression of Cdc25B alone
caused phosphorylation of gH2AX (Fig. 5C), we tested whether
Cdc25B also functions similarly to Cdc25A where overexpression of
Cdc25A in U20S cells was shown to activate checkpoints. Thus, we
examined the phosphorylation status of gH2AX, Ser15 on p53, and
Ser317 on Chk1 after chronic treatment with BPDE. As shown in
Fig. 6A, hyperphosphorylation of these DNA damage–sensing
proteins was sustained for at least 5 days after elevation of ectopic
Cdc25B. UV-treated cell lysate was used as a positive control for the
phosphorylation of gH2AX, activation of checkpoints. These results
are consistent with the generation of a stressful environment after
elevation of Cdc25B, which could be ideal for selection of cells with
compromised checkpoints. Interestingly, Cdc25B overexpression
for 5 days did not affect the cell growth as was reported previously
(10). Cdc25B overexpression can reduce clonogenic survival,
however (10). Chronic treatment of WT MEF with anti-BPDE
resulted in the loss of p53 and p21, also consistent with
compromised checkpoints. This loss seemed to at least partially
require the presence of Cdc25B as loss of p53 was attenuated in the
Cdc25B null MEFs (Fig. 6B and C). Surprisingly, p21 levels
increased in Cdc25B null MEFs after anti-BPDE treatment.

Discussion
The Cdc25 phosphatases are vital controllers of cell entry and
progression into mitosis. Our understanding of the relative
importance of each of the family members in the regulation of
Cdk-cyclin complexes after DNA damage–induced cell cycle arrest
continues to evolve. Although initial studies using mice lacking
functional Cdc25B suggested a relatively normal phenotype, more
recent data from several groups indicate that Cdc25B is required

for an efficient exit from G2 arrest (9, 10, 20). Proteins, such as pololike kinase-1 (Plk1), which controls the half-life of the Cdc25inactivating kinase Wee1, are also required for this process (9).
These observations have led to the hypothesis that an increase in
endogenous Cdc25B could be part of the normal response to
recover from DNA damage. The data presented herein indicate that
induction of Cdc25B protein could be an important event in antiBPDE–induced neoplasia. Consistent with previous studies (16, 17),
treatment of WT MEFs with anti-BPDE resulted in a transformed
phenotype that was characterized by colony formation in culture,
soft agar, and tumor production in nude mice on s.c. injection. In
contrast, MEFs derived from Cdc25B null mice failed to form
colonies or to produce tumors in athymic mice (Fig. 3). Treatment
of WT MEFs with the parent hydrocarbon failed to increase
Cdc25B protein level, which was probably attributable to poor
bioactivation of BP in MEFs. In contrast to cells treated with antiBPDE, cells treated with either BP or BP-tetrol, which is a
nontumorigenic metabolite of anti-BPDE, seemed to have reduced
levels of Cdc25B (Fig. 2). We have no explanation at this time for
the apparent decrease seen with BP or BP-tetrol but this is worthy
of further study. Collectively, however, these data suggest that the
epoxide functional group, which is essential for DNA damage, has
an important role in anti-BPDE–mediated induction of Cdc25B
protein.
The induction of a Cdc25 family member after carcinogenmediated DNA damage would seem at first rather surprising as this
could facilitate Cdk activation and cell cycle progression rather
than checkpoint activation. Indeed, with most DNA-damaging
agents, Cdc25A is phosphorylated and rapidly degraded (28–31).
Recent studies indicate that anti-BPDE can induce Chk1- and
Chk1-dependent degradation of Cdc25A (24, 32). Our results
showing that cells activate G2-M checkpoint immediately following
anti-BPDE irrespective of Cdc25B levels (Fig. 5) is consistent with
the model that initial cell cycle arrest following DNA damage might
be more dependent on the loss of Cdc25A. If, however, there is an
increase in basal level of Cdc25B due to chronic exposure to DNAdamaging anti-BPDE, then resumption could occur in the presence
of DNA damage (Fig. 6). Such an event could explain why
transgenic mice overexpressing Cdc25B in mammary epithelium
have increased susceptibility to 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene–
induced mammary tumorigenesis (17). These results are analogous
to a recent study showing that Chk1 and Plk1 regulate checkpoint
adaptation/premature recovery in human cells following ionizing
radiation (33). These findings suggest that human cells, like their

yeast counterpart, can divide in the presence of DNA damage,
which could increase the risk in diploid cells for development of
genetically unstable cells that may progress toward cancer.
Interestingly, positive regulators (Plk1 and Cdc25B) of premature
recovery/checkpoint adaptation are overexpressed in many human
tumors and negative regulator (Chk1) is mutated in several
malignancies (30, 34–37). Taken together, these findings indicate
that Cdc25B could promote premature recovery from checkpoints
without completion of DNA repair.
It is interesting to note that the increased expression of Cdc25B
even in the absence of an overt DNA-damaging agent also resulted
in DNA damage and activation of checkpoints (Fig. 6). These
results are consistent with previous reports describing activation of
checkpoints in response to replication stress induced by overexpression of Cdc25A, cyclin E, and E2F (26, 27). Based on these
results, it was proposed that in precancerous lesions, oncogenic
stress could regulate selection of cells with compromised
checkpoint signaling, thus leading to genetic instability and tumor
progression. Hence, markedly reduced level of p53 in the chronically anti-BPDE–exposed WT MEFs with a transformed phenotype is consistent with a role for Cdc25B in checkpoint
deregulation. Surprisingly, p21 levels increased in anti-BPDE–
treated Cdc25B null MEFs. These results are very similar to Wani
et al. (38), who found increased p21 levels in response to anti-BPDE
treatment irrespective of p53 levels.
Finally, induction of Cdc25B may not be restricted to the
carcinogen anti-BPDE. Recently, Cdc25B was found to be elevated
in cells chronically exposed to ionizing radiation. Repeated
exposure to ionizing radiation leads to tumorigenic phenotype in
these cells. These results suggest that increase in Cdc25B levels
could potentially play an important role in tumorigenesis induced
by several different DNA-damaging agents (39).
