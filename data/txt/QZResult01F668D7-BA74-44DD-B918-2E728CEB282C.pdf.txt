ABSTRACT
The efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy depends on the selective delivery
of 10B to the target. Integrins αvβ3 are transmembrane receptors over-expressed in
both glioblastoma cells and its neovasculature. In this study, a novel approach to
dual-target glioblastoma vasculature and tumor cells was investigated. Liposomes
(124 nm) were conjugated with a αvβ3 ligand, cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acidtyrosine-cysteine peptide (c(RGDyC)-LP) (1% molar ratio) through thiol-maleimide
coupling. Expression of αvβ3 in glioblastoma cells (U87) and human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC), representing tumor angiogenesis, was determined using
Western Blotting with other cells as references. The results showed that both U87
and HUVEC had stronger expression of αvβ3 than other cell types, and the degree of
cellular uptake of c(RGDyC)-LP correlated with the αvβ3-expression levels of the cells. In
contrast, control liposomes without c(RGDyC) showed little cellular uptake, regardless
of cell type. In an in vitro boron neutron capture therapy study, the c(RGDyC)-LP
containing sodium borocaptate generated more rapid and significant lethal effects
to both U87 and HUVEC than the control liposomes and drug solution. Interestingly,
neutron irradiated U87 and HUVEC showed different types of subsequent cell death. In
conclusion, this study has demonstrated the potential of a new dual-targeting strategy
using c(RGDyC)-LP to improve boron neutron capture therapy for glioblastoma.

healthy tissues. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT)
has emerged as a promising approach to selectively target
glioblastoma [4].
BNCT is a binary treatment modality, combining
systemic administration of a boron compound with local
application of thermal neutrons [4]. Under low energy
thermal neutron irradiation, boron-10 (10B), a non-toxic
and non-radioactive constituent of the natural elemental
boron, captures neutrons and the resultant fission reaction
releases lethal and local radiant energy in the form of
alpha (α) particles and lithium-7 (7Li) nuclei. The resulting
α particles have an average high linear energy transfer

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma
multiforme, is the most aggressive brain cancer with
a short median survival of 15 months [1, 2]. Despite
improvements in conventional therapies, including surgery
techniques, chemotherapy developments and radiotherapy
technologies, glioblastoma remains an incurable disease
due to the poor specificity of current therapies and the
high filtration and resistance features of the tumor tissue
[3]. The ideal strategy for treatment is to selectively
destroy glioblastoma while sparing the neighboring

value of 307 keV/μm [5] which can induce complex DNA
double-strand breaks and consequent cell death [6]. These
particles dissipate their kinetic energy over a distance of
5–9 μm, slightly less than the diameter of a single cell,
therefore localizing the radiation damage to within, or
close to, cells that bind or internalize 10B at sufficient
concentrations [4, 7]. The minimum boron level, counted
as 10B, required to generate lethal damage is estimated to
be about 20 μg per gram of tissue or 109 atoms per cell
[8]. Therefore, the effectiveness and specificity of BNCT
is largely dependent on the selective delivery of 10B in the
tumor. By targeting the delivery of 10B to tumor cells, the
neutron beams selectively destroy the boron-bearing tumor
tissues leaving the surrounding normal tissues undamaged.
To date, two boron-containing agents, sodium
borocaptate (BSH), and boronophenylalanine (BPA)
have been clinically approved for the treatment of
glioblastoma in the United States, Japan and Europe [4, 7,
9]. BSH (Na2B12H11SH) is a hydrophilic boron compound
containing twelve 10B atoms per molecule, has low toxicity
and high stability in biological medium [10]. However, the
lack of tumor selectivity limited their clinical therapeutic
outcomes. In the case of human glioblastoma, a disrupted
and hyper-permeable blood–brain barrier (BBB) has
been observed [11], the inter-endothelial fenestrations
in tumors are reported to be up to 300 nm [12]. In this
context, targeted boron delivery using nanotechnology has
emerged as an attractive strategy to pass BBB and achieve
glioblastoma-selective intracellular accumulation of 10B
[13]. Through the attachment or encapsulation of boron
compounds with nano-sized carriers (100-200 nm), such
as liposomes [14, 15], nanotubes [16] and dendrimers
[17], specific accumulation can be achieved by exploiting
the leaky vasculature in the tumor and the resulting
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects [18].
In addition, the surface of these nanocarriers can be
modified with specific ligands, such as transferrin [19, 20]
or folate [21], to selectively bind receptors over-expressed
in glioblastomas. These approaches have reportedly
enhanced intracellular boron delivery and thus anti-tumor
effects in preclinical studies.
Among these nanocarriers, liposomes are an
attractive carrier for tumor targeting due to their
amphiphilic properties, biocompatibility and ease for
surface modification. These systems have no innate ability
to recognize the vascular endothelial cells in malignant
tumors and have limited transvascular transport [22].
Therefore, an approach is sought to increase the tumor
selectivity by targeting the tumor neo-vasculature followed
by enhanced tumor penetration.
It is well documented that integrins, such as αvβ3,
are over-expressed in endothelial cells undergoing rapid
angiogenesis as well as in some tumor cells but barely
detectable in normal brain cells [23]. Overexpression of
integrins αvβ3 have been observed in both tumor cells
[24] and the microvasculature of glioblastoma [25].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Notably, glioblastomas are rich in microvasculature and
characterized by rapid angiogenesis [26, 27]. Furthermore,
the expression level of integrins in tumor vasculature
correlates with the grade of malignancy of neuroblastoma
[28, 29], making their vasculature a clinically important
target. Peptides containing an arginine-glycine-aspartic
acid (RGD) sequence are found to specifically bind with
integrin αvβ3 [30]. Furthermore, compared to linear RGD
peptides, cyclic RGD peptides, such as cyclic arginineglycine-aspartic acid-tyrosine-cysteine (c(RGDyC)), are
more stable and have higher affinity to integrin αvβ3 [31].
Both linear and cyclic RGD have been used as ligands
for drug delivery to target tumors such as hepatoma and
melanoma [32, 33]. Taken together, it was envisaged that
cyclic RGD peptide-modified nano-sized boron delivery
systems would provide a dual targeting approach by
exploiting the overexpression of αvβ3 of both tumor
vasculature and tumor cells of glioblastoma lead to more
effective BNCT.
This study aimed to address the limited
glioblastoma-specific tissue accumulation as well as the
poor cellular penetration of the boron agent BSH, with a
liposomal delivery system modified with c(RGDyC). The
dual-targeting effect of c(RGDyC) modified liposomes to
tumor vasculature and glioblastoma cells was evaluated
on a representative tumor angiogenesis model, human
umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) [34]; and
a glioblastoma cell model, human glioblastoma cell line
(U87). Western Blotting was used to confirm the integrin
αvβ3 expression on these cell lines and to compare
with the human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MIA
PaCa-2, the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and
the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 to identify
integrin-negative controls. Finally the in vitro BNCT
efficacy of c(RGDyC) modified liposomes containing
BSH was assessed on these cell lines by thermal neutron
irradiation in comparison with liposomes without peptide
modification and a BSH solution.

RESULTS
Formation of c(RGDyC) modified liposomes
A c(RGDyC) (1%, molar ratio) modified liposomal
system (c(RGDyC)-LP) for the dual-targeting of tumor
vasculature and glioblastoma cells was developed. The
c(RGDyC) peptides were conjugated to the liposomal
surface through a thiol-maleimide coupling reaction
and a high attachment efficiency (>98%) was achieved
following 24 h incubation at 22 °C. A decrease in reaction
temperature to 4 °C resulted in no detectable attachment
while an increase in temperature to 37 °C resulted in
51.9% attachment efficiency. The successful conjugation
at 22 °C was confirmed by the observation that the zeta
potential of liposomes dropped by 10 mV (p < 0.01)
(Table 1).

fluorescence intensity and a positive correlation between
the fluorescence signal and degree of uptake.

The unmodified (LP) and c(RGDyC) modified
liposomes were around 124 nm in diameter. Except for
zeta potential there was no significant change in particle
physicochemical properties following conjugation with
1% (mol) c(RGDyC) (p > 0.05) (Table 1). Conjugation
decreased the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of BSH within
the liposomes from 5.5 ± 1.31% to 2.6 ± 0.04%, however
the release of BSH was significantly slowed down (53.2
± 1.3% versus 96.9 ± 7.4%) (Figure 1B). Cryo-TEM
micrographs (Figure 1A) showed that c(RGDyC)-LP and
LP were both unilamellar. The liposome concentration was
found to be similar in the two formulations with 6.5 × 1013
/ml in c(RGDyC)-LP and 5.6 × 1013/ml in LP. Stability
study demonstrated that the zeta potential, particle size
and PDI of c(RGDyC)-LP remained unchanged and no
drug leakage for at least 4 weeks, while drug leakage of
LP was observed in week 4 (Table 1).

Cellular uptake of liposomes
The degree of cellular uptake of c(RGDyC)-LP
strongly correlated with the expression of integrin αvβ3 on
the cell lines. In contrast to treatment with LP, treatment
with c(RGDyC)-LP resulted in significantly higher levels
of fluorescence in HUVEC and U87 cells (Figure 4A and
4B), but a similar level in MIA PaCa-2 (Figure 4C). The
strong cellular uptake of c(RGDyC)-LP by the HUVEC
and U87 cells was inhibited when pre-treated with free
c(RGDyC) (Figures 4 and 5). The cellular uptake increased
from 3 h to 16 h in all cases, the fluorescence intensity of
c(RGDyC)-LP treated U87 cells was double that of LP
treated cells at 3 h and maintained at the same ratio over
16 h. In HUVEC, the fluorescence intensity resulted from
c(RGDyC)-LP treatment for 3 h was 2.5 times higher
than the LP treatment, and the difference increased to >
4 times at 16 h (Figure 5). Notably, while the internalized
fluorescence was distributed throughout the cytoplasm
it was more prominent in the areas surrounding nuclei.
Moreover, cell aggregation was observed in HUVEC and
U87 cells (Figure 4D).

Integrin αvβ3 expression analyzed by
Western Blotting
Western Blotting analysis (Figure 2) indicated that
HUVEC had the strongest expression of integrin αvβ3
followed by U87, while MIA PaCa-2 and macrophage
cells did not display any detectable expression. Therefore,
MIA PaCa-2 was used to represent normal cells with low
expression of αvβ3 in the following studies. Interestingly,
despite the wide report [35], breast cancer cell line MCF-7
only expressed the integrin subunit, αv.

In vitro BNCT

alone on HUVEC and U87 cells, expressed as the relative

MIA PaCa-2 cell metabolic activity initially resulted in
a 150% relative cell viability at 24 h, however the cell
viability declined continuously from day 1 with a 13%
relative cell viability observed on the 7th day. In contrast,
neutron irradiation reduced the relative cell viability of
U87 to 50% on day 1 and the cell viability maintained the

same growth rate as the control cells up to day 3, however
doubled at day 5 before the second drop at day 7.

In both HUVEC and U87 cells with BNCT, the c(RGDyC)LP pretreatment for 3 h led to the most significant reduction
in cell viability compared with LP and BSH solutions.
Extending the treatment with formulations to 16 h resulted
in lower MTT cell viability close to 20% on HUVECs and
50% in U87 cells, regardless of the formulation (p>0.05).
Moreover, U87 cell mutation was observed at day 3 post
irradiation, some cells were giant shuttle-shaped and some
were longer branched.

The efficacy of BNCT on cell viability
Figure 7 shows the in vitro BNCT efficacy with the
cells pre-treated with formulations for either 3 h or 16 h
prior to 7 h irradiation. The cell viability measured on the 4th
day after irradiation was compared to non-irradiated control
cells cultured in medium to demonstrate the BNCT efficacy.

DISCUSSION

to increase the physical stability of liposomes through
electrostatic repulsion. Besides, this negative charge
would repel the ionized BSH species of the same
charge, decreasing its release rate by diffusion across
the liposomal membrane. This phenomenon has been
reported to the other peptide-modified liposomes, such
as asparagine-glycine-arginine (NGR) for doxorubicin
and cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-tyrosine-lysine
(c(RGDyk)) for cisplatin [38, 39].
Initially in this study, integrin αvβ3 expression
was determined in several representative cell lines with
both HUVEC and U87 showing strong expression of
αvβ3 (Figure 2) which is consistent with the literature.
Little or no expression was found in other cancer cell
lines tested, MIA PaCa-2 cells and MCF-7 cells. The
degree of cellular uptake of c(RGDyC)-LP strongly
correlated with the cellular expression of integrin αvβ3
(Figure 4). The MIA PaCa-2 cancer cell line, with no
integrin αvβ3 expression, showed no benefit to use
c(RGDyC)-LP. The study suggests that evaluation of
biomarker expression in the target tissues is necessary for
developing personalized targeted therapies. In integrinpositive HUVEC and U87 cells, c(RGDyC) significantly
enhanced the cellular uptake of c(RGDyC)-LP most
likely through integrin αvβ3-mediated pathways. This
is also supported by the finding that pretreatment with

In this study, we focused on a new approach by
dual-targeting tumor vasculature and glioblastoma cells to
enhance the efficiency of 10B delivery by exploiting the
overexpression of integrin αvβ3 in both cell types. Hereby,
a cyclic peptide c(RGDyC) modified liposomal delivery
system has been developed and demonstrated to have
dual-targeting potential.
With the optimised conditions, liposomes were
covalently conjugated with c(RGDyC) with a high
efficiency ( > 98%) and within the optimal size range for
exploiting the EPR effect (100-200 nm) [18]. The low
EE of BSH in the nano-sized liposomes (approximately
5%) is typical for a water-soluble drugs like BSH,
which predominately depends on the volume ratio of
BSH solution inside and outside liposomes (Vin/Vout)
during liposome formation [36, 37]. Therefore, EE can
be enhanced by reducing Vout or increasing the mass
of lipids (increasing Vin), whereas the loading capacity
could be further improved when a more concentrated
BSH solution is used. The EE of BSH in c(RGDyC)LP was reduced by 2% compared with LP, possible due
to the drug leakage during the 24 h conjugation with
the peptide. Conjugation with c(RGDyC) increased
the magnitude of the zeta potential which is expected

c(RGDyC) inhibited the cellular uptake of c(RGDyC)LP. However, αvβ3-mediated endocytosis is not the only
pathway for the internalization of c(RGDyC)-LP. Cao
et al. reported that other endocytic pathways including
macropinocytosis and clathrin-dependent endocytosis
were also involved in the cellular uptake of RGD
modified liposomes [40]. Interestingly, HUVEC and
U87 cells which have strong integrin αvβ3 expression
aggregated when treated with c(RGDyC)-LP, or following
pretreatment with free c(RGDyC) (Figure 4). Besides, the
aggregated cells tended to detach from the wells, resulting
in large variant in fluorescent intensities (Figure 5).
This could be explained as c(RGDyC) occupied the cell
surface integrins, therefore blocked integrin-mediated cell
adhesion and led to cell detachment and even apoptosis
[29, 41].
To understand in vitro BNCT, the effect of neutron
irradiation on cells without formulation pretreatment was
first investigated. Following irradiation different cells
appeared to have different response in the following 7 days
(Figure 6). Neutron radiation can induce cell deaths by
two pathways, apoptosis and necrosis [42]. Cell necrosis
may be reflected by MTT assay directly, while apoptotic
cells retain ability to reduce MTT salts in the early stage
after irradiation [43]. The cell growth curves may indicate
that HUVEC and MIA PaCa-2 cells underwent apoptosis
with an initially high metabolic activity (relative viability
~150% at day 1 for both); but as apoptosis further
programmed MTT absorbance dropped over time. On the
other hand, U87 cells may have experienced necrosis in
response to irradiation, and lost the viability (50%) rapidly
as observed at day 1. However, as a type of brain tumor
cells, U87 cells have higher capacity of DNA repair [44].
This may lead to rapid proliferation as observed on day 3
and day 5. The cells with unrepaired DNA break leads to
subsequent cell death which occurs after a variable number
of cell cycles [45], explaining the low MTT response on
day 7. On the other hand, the cells with misrepaired DNA
will lead to mutation [45]. Indeed, mutant U87 cells were
also observed under microscope from day 3 to day 7.
Based on the above understanding of the cell lines,
an MTT assay was carried out on day 4 in the in vitro
BNCT study, as on this time both necrosis and apoptosis
could be observed for all cells. The MTT assay which
assesses cell metabolic activity was used to quantify
BNCT effects in this study as it is prescribed as a
quantitative cytotoxicity technique in the latest revision
of ISO International Standards [46]. Furthermore, MTT
assay has been employed to determine cell survival after
irradiation [47, 48] with a reported similarity to clonogenic
assays [49].
In the in vitro BNCT study, pretreatments of
HUVEC with all formulations for only 3 h resulted in 7080% cell death, with c(RGDyC)-LP being more significant
than LP and BSH solution (Figure 7). The conventional
liposomes can be internalized through clathrin-mediated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

endocytosis. Cyclic RGD peptides are reported not
only able to bind to integrin αvβ3 as a ligand but also
recruit clathrin and thus promote clathrin-mediated
endocytosis [50, 51]. Hence, the superiority of the use of
c(RGDyC)-LP over LP and BSH was observed with 3 h
pretreatment. When incubation time extended to 16 h, all
the formulations could have delivered sufficient amount
of 10B to lead to complete cell death after irradiation. With
U87, 3 h pretreatment saw a significant reduction in MTT
viability measured at the day 4 with c(RGDyC)-LP than
LP or BSH solution treatment. The high variations of the
data at day 4 may be due to misrepaired or unrepaired
DNA as the result of irradiation, and these cells would
possibly undergo subsequent apoptosis, as shown in
Figure 6.
Other researches pre-incubated cells with 10B
formulations for up to 24 h prior to BNCT [47, 52].
This research suggests that even 3 h pretreatment with
c(RGDyC)-LP was sufficient to generate lethal effects
for both HUVEC and U87. Given the dynamic change of
liposomes in the bloodstream, 3 h pretreatment in the in
vitro study may be more clinically relevant.
In summary, the findings from this study has
highlighted the potential of a new dual-targeting approach
using c(RGDyC) modified liposomes for specific boron
delivery to glioblastoma, addressing the major limitation
of poor tumor accumulation of 10B in BNCT. Rather than
targeting the tumor cells alone, the distinctive features
of glioblastoma, rich microvascularture has also been
exploited. To confirm our novel dual-targeting strategy,
translational research with precise tracking of liposomal
boron uptake by tumor using animal model is of great
interest for future research.

modified from previous report with minimal modification
[55]. Briefly, the mobile phase at a constant flow rate of
1 mL/min consists of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water
(eluant A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile
(eluant B). The gradient elution was set from 10% to 50%
B in 50 min, and back to 10% B over 5 min. The detection
wavelength was set at 280 nm. The retention times of
free c(RGDyC) and its dimer were 10.3 and 14.9 min,
respectively.

Formation of c(RGDyC) modified liposomes

Characterization of liposomes

Plain liposomes were first prepared, PEGylation was
applied to liposomes to avoid being cleared from the blood
stream before reaching the tumor cells [53]. Liposomes
contain DSPE-PEG2000-MAL could then be conjugated
with c(RGDyC) to form c(RGDyC) modified liposomes.

The size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta
potential of the liposomes were measured before and after
c(RGDyC) attachment by dynamic light scattering using
a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments, UK). All
measurements performed in triplicate at 25 °C.
To determine the EE of BSH, free drugs and
liposomes were separated by ultra-centrifugation at 41,000
rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The liposomes were re-suspended
after centrifugation, and the encapsulated BSH was
extracted from liposomes using acetonitrile (1:4, v/v).
The concentrations of BSH were analysed by a validated
ion-pairing HPLC method using a Phenomenex C18
column (5 μm, 250 mm × 4.60 mm) with UV detection
at 230 nm. A ternary mobile phase system consisted of
methanol, acetonitrile and 10 mM tetrabutylammonium
hydrogensulfate buffer (pH 7) (30:30:40, v/v/v). The EE
was calculated as the amount of BSH encapsulated in
the liposomes versus the total quantity of BSH added for
preparation. The particle concentration was determined
using Nanosight nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight
NS300, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) at camera level of
10. Data was analyzed on the NTA software 3.0 (ATA
Scientific, Australia).
To investigate the drug release properties, pelletized
liposomes were suspended in isotonic phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, 0.01 M, pH7.4) and maintained at 37 °C with
gentle shaking to simulate the in vivo conditions. Samples
were taken at 1, 3, 8, 24 and 48 h. Released drug was
immediately isolated by centrifugation at 41,000 rpm for 1 h
at 4°C, and subjected to HPLC analysis. The amount of drug

Preparation of plain liposomes
Plain liposomes were prepared by the thin-filmhydration method. DPPG, cholesterol, DSPE-mPEG2000
and DSPE-PEG2000-MAL (molar ratios 6.5:3:0.4:0.1) were
dissolved in chloroform: methanol (3:1, v/v) in a roundbottom flask. The solvent was gently removed on a rotary
evaporator under reduced pressure to form a thin lipid
film on the flask wall which was then put under nitrogen
to completely remove traces of organic solvent. The thin
lipid film was hydrated at 45°C in 50 mM BSH, or calcein
dissolved in 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). Seven cycles
of freeze-thaw were applied after liposome formation
involving freezing in liquid nitrogen and then thawing in a
45°C water-bath [54]. The resulting liposomes were extruded
through 200 nm membranes to obtain a uniform size.
Control liposomes without c(RGDyC) modification
(LP) composed of DPPG, cholesterol, DSPE-mPEG2000
(molar ratios 6.5:3:0.5) were also prepare as described
above.
Attachment of c(RGDyC)
The c(RGDyC) was subsequently grafted to the
surface of liposomes through a thiol-maleimide coupling
reaction of c(RGDyC) with DSPE-PEG2000-MAL. Briefly,
c(RGDyC) (1%, molar ratio) was dissolved in 100 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with the liposomes

released at 4°C during the centrifugation was negligible. All
the samples were placed in closed Eppendorf tubes sealed
by Parafilm to avoid evaporation and kept in dark.
For stability tests, liposomes in pellet form were
stored in the dark at 4°C. Particle size, PDI, zeta potential
and drug leakage were monitored over 30 days.
The morphology liposomes were investigated
using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM). The liposomes were diluted ten times with isotonic
PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) and placed on a copper grid in the
climate chamber and blotted, leaving a thin film stretched
over the holes. The samples were frozen by submersion
in liquid ethane and cooled to 90 K by liquid nitrogen.
Samples were exposed to electrons and photographed at an
accelerating voltage of 120 kV in a Tecnai 12 transmission
electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, USA).

at high concentrations resulting in a nonlinear signalconcentration [58] necessitated the determination of an
optimised working concentration in liposomes. Briefly,
liposomes were prepared as described above, with calcein
solution being used to hydrate the lipid thin film. After
seeding cells in a 96-well plate at a density of 3,000/100
μL/well for 24 h, U87 cells were incubated with 200 μL
of liposomes containing different levels of calcein for 4 h
or 24 h at 37 °C. After washing the cells with isotonic icecold 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) three times, the fluorescence
intensity of remaining intracellular calcein was measured
in a microplate reader (λ ex/λ em: 495/515 nm, SpectraMax
M2, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The concentration
which provided maximal fluorescence intensity was
selected for the subsequent cellular uptake study.

Western blotting

The cellular uptake of calcein-encapsulated
liposomes with or without 1% c(RGDyC) on HUVEC
and U87 cells in comparison with MIA PaCa-2 cells was
observed by fluorescence microscopy and quantified by
measuring the fluorescence intensity, as described above,
following 3 h or 16 h incubation. In parallel, a competition
assay was performed by pre-incubating cells with excess
of c(RGDyC) (0.5 mM) for 15 min before cellular uptake
was observed.
For microscopy imaging, the cells were fixed by
adding 4% paraformaldehyde to each well. After rinsing
with PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4), 300 nM of DAPI (λ ex/λ em:
345/661 nm) staining solution was added to stain the
nucleus acids. Cells were visualized using a standard
fluorescence microscope (Leica DU IL LED, Danaher,
Wetzlar, Germany).

Cellular uptake of liposomes

Western Blotting was used to detect the expression
of integrin αvβ3 on the various cell lines, HUVEC, U87,
MIA PaCa-2, MCF-7 and RAW 264.7. Each cell line (106
cells) was washed 3 times with ice-cold isotonic PBS
(0.01M, pH 7.4) and protein extracts were prepared by
lysing in NP40 cell lysis buffer (Life Technologies, USA)
on ice. The lysates were then centrifuged at 13,400 rpm
for 10 min; the supernatant was collected and mixed
with loading dye. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for
5 min before loading into a 10% Mini-PROTEAN TGX
precast protein gel. Electrophoresis was performed in a
vertical electrophoresis system with Tris-glycine running
buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 0.1 % SDS, pH
8.3). The proteins were allowed to separate for 30-40 min
at 200 V and then transferred into a PVDF membrane
using the Transblot turbo™ transfer system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked with
5% skim milk (Select, New Zealand) in 0.01 M PBS
(pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed
with primary antibodies, integrin rabbit anti-human αv
antibody, rabbit anti-human integrin β3 antibody (both
at 1:1000, Cell Signaling, MA, USA) or a goat antihuman β-actin antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz, TX, USA),
overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter membranes were incubated
with an HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:5000/1: 10000, Cell Signaling, MA, USA) for 1
h at room temperature. Bolts were finally developed
with electrochemiluminescence prime substrate (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and imaged for
chemiluminescence using a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imager.

In vitro BNCT
The in vitro neutron irradiation experimental
procedures were modified from reported studies [59, 60]:
cells seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3,000/100
μL/well were cultured for 24 h, and 200 μL of each of the
formulations suspended in medium at a final equivalent
concentration of 20 μg/mL 10B. Following 3 h or 16 h
incubation, cells were washed three times and 450 μL
fresh medium was added to fully fill each well. Irradiation
was conducted by placing the sealed plates vertically
on the Dingo thermal neutron radiography/tomography/
imaging station sample stage and irradiating for 7 h
at room temperature to impart a total neutron fluence
of 1.2 × 1012 neutrons/cm2 in high-flux configuration
following the published neutron irradiation studies
[48, 61]. Meanwhile cells without irradiation were kept
under the same conditions acted as controls. The Dingo
instrument is located at the 20 MW OPAL research reactor,
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization
(Sydney, Australia). The actual thermal neutron and
photon dose at the sample position was measured from
the radioactivation of pure gold foils placed at multiple

spatial positions on the front side of each plate, and low
neutron sensitivity thermoluniscent (LiF;Mg,Ti) (TLD700) dosimeters placed on each side of the plate [62]. The
Cadmium Ratio Method was used to obtain the absolute
thermal flux values and doses delivered by BNCT to the
cells [63]. The thermal neutron flux and photon dose rate
imparted to the plates were 4.5 × 107 n cm-2 s-1 and 0.277
mGy s-1, respectively. A 6% decrease in neutron flux was
recorded across the well plate, corresponding to the radial
distribution of the collimated neutron beam at the sample
position (L/D = 500).
After irradiation, cell survival and growth were
monitored over 7 days using a MTT cell viability assay
[49]. The non-irradiated cells cultured in medium only
were used as control to obtain relative cell viabilities
for the treated cells. Cell growth curves over 7 days
after irradiation were created to demonstrate their
radiosensitivity to neutron irradiation alone. Histograms
of relative cell viability in the 4th day were generated to
illustrate the BNCT efficacy of different formulations.
