BACKGROUND: The addition of liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE) to
chemotherapy has been shown to improve overall survival in patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma
(OS). The authors report the results of addition of liposomal MTP-PE to chemotherapy for patients with
metastatic OS. METHODS: Intergroup-0133 was a prospective randomized phase 3 trial for the treatment
of newly diagnosed patients with OS. The authors compared 3-drug chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate (Regimen A) to the same 3 drugs with the addition of ifosfamide (Regimen B). The addition of liposomal MTP-PE to chemotherapy was evaluated. RESULTS: Five-year event-free
survival (EFS) for patients who received liposomal MTP-PE (n ¼ 46) was 42% versus 26% for those who
did not (n ¼ 45) (relative risk for liposomal MTP-PE, 0.72; P ¼ .23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-1.2).
The 5-year overall survival for patients who received MTP-PE versus no MTP-PE was 53% and 40%, respectively (relative risk for liposomal MTP-PE, 0.72; P ¼ 0.27; 95% CI, 0.40-1.3). The comparison of Regimen A
with Regimen B did not suggest a difference for EFS (35% vs 34%, respectively; relative risk for Regimen
B, 1.07; P ¼ .79; 95% CI, 0.62-1.8) or overall survival (52% vs 43%, respectively; relative risk for Regimen B,
1.1, P ¼ .75; 95% CI, 0.61-2.0). CONCLUSIONS: When the metastatic cohort was considered in isolation, the
addition of liposomal MTP-PE to chemotherapy did not achieve a statistically significant improvement in
outcome. However, the pattern of outcome is similar to the pattern in nonmetastatic patients. Cancer

The prognosis for patients with metastatic osteosarcoma
(OS) remains poor despite aggressive multimodality therapy. In contrast to those with nonmetastatic disease, who
have a 5-year survival of approximately 70% to 75%, survival for metastatic patients is significantly lower.1-8 Surgical resectability, the number of metastases at diagnosis,
and site(s) of metastases remain important determinants
of long-term survival.3,5,9 Several approaches using conventional cytotoxic therapies have been used in an effort
to enhance survival for patients who present with metastatic disease, but they have done little to improve the outcome of patients with metastatic OS in the last 30 years.
Most recently, an upfront window trial of topotecan in
newly diagnosed patients with metastatic OS reported
only 1 partial response and 1 clinical response (decreased
radiotracer uptake on bone scan and decrease in pain) in a
cohort of 27 evaluable patients.1 New approaches are
needed.
Muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine
(MTP-PE) is a nonspecific immune modulator that is a
synthetic analogue of a component of bacterial cell walls.
Incorporation of MTP-PE into liposomes has allowed targeted delivery of MTP-PE to monocytes and macrophages in areas such as the lungs.10 Liposomal MTP-PE is
able to activate these cells to become tumoricidal. Preclinical studies have already confirmed the antitumor effects of
liposomal MTP-PE in rodent and canine OS models.10-21
In addition, it has been shown that concurrent administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy does not interfere with
the antitumor effects of liposomal MTP-PE.17
From November 1993 through November 1997 the
Children’s Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology
Group carried out Intergroup Study 0133. This was a
prospective, randomized phase 3 trial of treatment of
newly diagnosed OS in patients 30 years old. The study
posed 2 questions in a 2-by-2 factorial design (Fig. 1).
First, there was a randomization to a 3-drug chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and high-dose methotrexate) or a 4-drug regimen using these agents with
ifosfamide. The second was a randomization to receive or
not to receive liposomal MTP-PE in addition to the randomly assigned chemotherapy. Outcome measures considered were event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival.
The results of this trial for patients with nonmetastatic OS
demonstrated a survival advantage (statistically significant
improvement in overall survival, and a trend toward

improved EFS) for patients receiving liposomal MTPPE.22 We report the results for patients with metastatic
disease enrolled in Intergroup Study 0133.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients enrolled in the study had histologically confirmed
high-grade intramedullary OS. Metastatic patients were
defined to be those patients in whom at least 1 site of metastasis had been reported at the time of enrollment and
before any therapeutic measures. Histologic confirmation
of metastasis was not required. Estimate of disease resectability was determined at study enrollment and was not
subsequently revised after induction chemotherapy.
Patients with clinically detectable metastatic disease were
eligible at Children’s Cancer Group institutions, but
ineligible at Pediatric Oncology Group institutions.
Detailed eligibility requirements have previously been
described.23

Treatment
Treatment details have also been previously described
(Fig. 1).23 Briefly, patients were assigned randomly to 1 of
4 regimens. There were 2 chemotherapy arms, Regimens
A (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate)
and B (ifosfamide, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate,
and cisplatin), and within those, patients were assigned
randomly to receive liposomal MTP-PE or not. Although
liposomal MTP-PE treatment did not begin until Week

12 of protocol therapy, randomization of treatment
assignment was done at entry. This resulted in 4 treatment
arms: A or B for chemotherapy, both with and without
liposomal MTP-PE.
Both regimens called for an initial period of chemotherapy, designated as induction, that lasted 10 weeks, followed by definitive resection of the primary tumor.
Maintenance was scheduled to begin at Week 12, but did
not begin until the surgeon determined that wound healing was adequate. Maintenance continued until Week 31
in Regimen A and Week 38 in Regimen B.
Half the patients were assigned randomly at entry to
receive liposomal MTP-PE beginning at Week 12 of protocol therapy. It was administered at a dose of 2 mg/m2.
Liposomal MTP-PE was administered twice weekly for
12 weeks beginning at Week 12, and weekly for an additional 24 weeks beginning at week 24. MTP-PE was not
interrupted for delays in chemotherapy.
Approval from the institutional review board (IRB)
was required at every institution before enrollment.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their
guardians, and the appropriate IRB-approved written
informed consent was signed.

Statistical Methods
Patient status current to August 31, 2005 was considered in the intent-to-treat analysis. EFS is defined to be
the time from study entry to progression of disease, diagnosis of second malignancy, death, or last follow-up,
whichever occurred first. Local progression at the end
of induction chemotherapy is specifically excluded as
an event, because we intended all patients in the study
to undergo surgery whenever possible. In prior Children’s Oncology Group studies, patients with apparent
radiographic tumor progression after induction therapy
often had significant necrosis observed in the primary
tumor after resection. For this reason, we did not consider apparent radiographic progression after induction
to be an event; such patients remained in the study.
Patients who experienced disease progression, diagnosis
of second malignancy, or death were considered to
have suffered an analytic event. Otherwise, the patient
was censored at last follow-up.
Overall survival is defined to be the time from study
entry to death or last follow-up, whichever occurred

first. Patients who died were considered to have
experienced an event. Otherwise, the patient was censored
at last follow-up.
The EFS and overall survival functions were estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier.24 The statistical significance of the comparisons of risk for adverse
event was assessed by means of the log-rank test,24 stratified by factors on which the randomization was balanced,
namely, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at study enrollment. Relative risks and associated confidence intervals
were estimated using a relative hazards model with the
characteristic of interest as the only variable in the
model.24
Interaction between assigned chemotherapy and
assigned biological agent was assessed using the relative
hazards regression. The hazard of an event (either analytic-event or death) was modeled as:
kðtjc; mÞ ¼ k0 ðtÞeb1 cþb2 mþb12 cm

The following terms were included in the
regression model: 1) c, chemotherapy, coded as 1 if
the patient was assigned Regimen B and 0 otherwise;
2) m, biological agent, coded as 1 if the patient was
assigned to receive liposomal MTP-PE and 0 otherwise; and 3) interaction, coded as the product of c
and m, that is, 1 if the patient received both Regimen B and liposomal MTP-PE and 0 otherwise. A P
value associated with the test of hypothesis b12 ¼ 0
of .10 or less was considered evidence of a significant
interaction. If there was no evidence of interaction,
the effect associated with liposomal MTP-PE was
estimated by performing a stratified log-rank test,
with chemotherapy randomization as the stratification
factor.24
The prognostic significance of selected patient characteristics determined at study enrollment was assessed
using a relative hazards model with the characteristic of
interest as the only variable in the model.24 To explore
the joint relationships between therapy assignment,
patient characteristics, and outcome, factors considered
significantly related to outcome as single characteristics
were incorporated into a relative risk regression model
along with the randomized therapeutic assignment. Backward stepwise regression was used to evaluate whether
therapeutic assignment was significantly related to

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of the 777 eligible patients enrolled on Intergroup Study
0133, 91 were found to have metastatic disease at initial
diagnosis and are the subjects for this report. Characteristics determined at enrollment for these patients are
described in Table 1. Median time of follow-up for
patients who had not experienced an adverse analytic
event was 89 months (range, 1-141 months).

Patient Outcomes: EFS
As of August 2005, the 5-year EFS for the entire cohort of
91 patients was 34% (95% confidence interval [CI],
24%-45%). When analyzed according to chemotherapy
regimen, the 5-year EFS for each of the regimens was as
follows: 1) Regimen A without MTP-PE ¼ 29% (95%
CI, 11%-51%); 2) Regimen A with MTP-PE ¼ 41%
(95% CI, 21%-60%); 3) Regimen B without MTP-PE ¼
23% (95% CI, 8%-43%); and 4) Regimen B with MTPPE ¼ 44% (95% CI, 23%-64%). There was no statistical
difference among the regimens (log-rank ¼ 0.55; Fig.
2A). By using the statistical test described above for risk
for adverse analytic event, there was no evidence of an
interaction between chemotherapy and liposomal MTPPE assignment (P ¼ .20).
The relative risk for adverse analytic event associated
with randomization to receive liposomal MTP-PE was
0.72 (P ¼ .23; 95% CI, 0.42-1.2; Table 2). The EFS at 5
years was 42% for those randomized to receive MTP-PE
versus 26% for those who were not (Fig. 2B). The relative
risk for adverse analytic event associated with randomization to receive chemotherapy Regimen B was 1.07 (P ¼
.79; 95% CI, 0.62-1.8; Table 2). The EFS at 5 years
was 34% for those randomized to 4-drug chemotherapy
versus 35% for those randomized to 3-drug chemotherapy
(Fig. 2C).
Local progression was specifically excluded as an
event for this analysis, as we intended all patients enrolled
on study to undergo surgery. Only 2 patients in this current cohort had radiographic evidence of local progression

There was no statistical difference among the regimens
(log-rank ¼ 0.60; Fig. 3A). By using the statistical test
described above for risk of adverse analytic event, there
was no evidence of an interaction between chemotherapy
and liposomal MTP-PE assignment (P ¼ .39).
The relative risk for death associated with randomization to receive liposomal MTP-PE was 0.72 (P ¼ .27;
95% CI, 0.40-1.3; Table 2). The survival at 5 years was
53% for those randomized to receive MTP-PE versus
40% for those who were not (Fig. 3B). The relative risk
for death associated with randomization to receive chemotherapy Regimen B was 1.1 (P ¼ .75; 95% CI, 0.61-2.0;
Table 2). The survival at 5-years was 43% for those
randomized to ifosfamide versus 52% for those who were
not (Fig. 3C).

To explore joint relationships between therapy assignment and these prognostic factors, we performed an analysis of a relative risk regression model including these
prognostic factors and therapy assignment. The relative
risk for EFS and survival in this backward stepwise regression analysis was not different from the univariate analysis
of the relative risks of therapy assignment alone (Table 3).
Several clinical factors correlated with worse EFS
and overall survival in this cohort of patients. Male

The poor prognosis of patients who present with metastatic OS highlights the need for new active agents to be
identified. We have learned that dose intensification of
conventional cytotoxic agents, although leading to greater
necrosis after preoperative chemotherapy, does not alter
the 20% long-term survival of patients with metastatic
OS.25,26 Addition of conventional cytotoxic agents that
appear to have activity in the preclinical setting, such as
topotecan, has also not led to improvement in patient
survival.1
As an immune modulator, liposomal MTP-PE has
been studied extensively and presents a novel avenue of
therapy for these patients. The initial analysis of the

nonmetastatic cohort of Intergroup Study 0133 detected
interaction between the 2 factors under study.23 This led
to a preliminary conclusion that the addition of liposomal
MTP-PE to traditional chemotherapy did not confer a
survival advantage to these patients.23 However, with longer follow-up of the same cohort, the test of the hypothesis
of interaction no longer met a conventional level of significance, allowing us to perform the factorial analyses originally designed for this study. We identified a trend toward
improved EFS and a statistically significant improvement
in overall survival for those who received liposomal MTPPE, independent of chemotherapy regimen.22 Specifi5346

cally, in the nonmetastatic cohort of patients (n ¼ 662),
the relative risk of death for patients randomized to
receive liposomal MTP-PE was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96;
P ¼ .03), and the hazard ratio for EFS for patients who
received liposomal MTP-PE was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.62-1.0;
P ¼ .08). Interestingly, the same pattern of survival
enhancement seen in the nonmetastatic, resectable group
of patients was also seen in the metastatic cohort reported
here: a trend toward improved EFS and overall survival
with addition of liposomal MTP-PE to chemotherapy. In
addition, there was no statistically significant difference
between the 2 chemotherapy regimens with respect to
EFS or overall survival in the metastatic cohort presented
here. The study was not powered to detect differences
between the 4 study arms. We cannot make firm conclusions about the apparent differences of survival between
the study arms. A larger, adequately powered study would
help to resolve potential differences between chemotherapy regimens.
Previous studies described clinical characteristics in
the population of metastatic patients that correlate with
outcome, including age, sites of metastases, number of
pulmonary nodules, and levels of biochemical markers
(AP, LDH).3,5,7,9 Many of these studies were performed
at single institutions or described a population of patients
who were treated with different protocols over a span of
decades. Although this study was not powered to detect
outcome differences in a subpopulation of patients with
metastatic disease, it does provide valuable clues as to
potentially prognostic clinical characteristics. Several clinical factors in this particular cohort of patients were
related to worse outcome, including sex (male), race (nonCaucasians), extent of disease involvement (bone metastases), and nonspecific biochemical markers of tumor burden (high AP and LDH). When incorporated into a
relative risk regression model, both sex and baseline alkaline phosphatase levels were related to overall survival and
EFS. In this study, female patients had better EFS and
overall survival. Although this recapitulates the findings of
published studies by some, but not all, investigators (most
notably, the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group recently published data supporting the better prognosis of female OS
patients),5,7,27 the reason for this consistent observation
remains unclear. In addition, these results reinforce the
notion that increased tumor burden (as suggested by
higher AP) leads to worse prognosis. Of interest is the lack

of impact the number and location of lung nodules had
on both EFS and overall survival. This is likely a reflection
of the small sample size of the study population. A larger
population would have provided an opportunity to detect
the impact of lung tumor burden in these patients. Also,
age at diagnosis did not correlate with outcome in this
group of patients. In addition to these 2 characteristics,
race was significantly related to risk of adverse analytic
event, with non-Caucasian patients having worse EFS and
overall survival.
Although the small number of patients in this cohort
preclude precise estimation of treatment effects, it is still
important to note that both EFS and overall survival
appear to be improved for the patients who received liposomal MTP-PE. In addition, the reductions in risk of
adverse analytic event and death are very similar to the
pattern in the much larger cohort of patients who presented without clinically detectable metastatic disease.
These data suggest that liposomal MTP-PE might provide
benefit when added to chemotherapy for the treatment of
