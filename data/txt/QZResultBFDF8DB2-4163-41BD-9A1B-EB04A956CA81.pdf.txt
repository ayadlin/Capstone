BACKGROUND: The current study was a multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study performed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy
of bevacizumab combined with docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (B-DOC) in patients with advanced human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, previously untreated, gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Tumor HER2 status was determined centrally. Patients received 6 cycles of bevacizumab at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, docetaxel at a dose of 50 mg/m2,
and oxaliplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 (all on day 1) combined with capecitabine at a dose of 850 mg/m2 twice daily (days 1-14) every 3 weeks followed by maintenance with capecitabine and bevacizumab in patients with disease control. The primary objective was
to demonstrate a progression-free survival (PFS) of >6.5 months, according to the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Secondary endpoints included safety, objective response rate, overall survival (OS), analyses of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and pharmacogenetic
analyses. RESULTS: Sixty eligible patients were enrolled. The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 7.2-10.9 months). The objective
response rate was 70% (95% CI, 55%-83%) and the disease control rate was 96% (95% CI, 85%-99%). The median OS was 12.0 months
(95% CI, 10.2-16.1 months). According to CTC-AE v4.0, the most common treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia
(20%), leukocytopenia (18%), diarrhea (15%), and nausea/vomiting (15%). The presence of CTCs at baseline was strongly predictive of
PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; P 5.007) and OS (HR, 3.4; P 5.014). The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T genotype
was strongly associated with PFS (HR, 4.7 for TT vs CC or CT; P 5.0007) and OS (HR, 5.9; P 5.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The B-DOC
regimen plus maintenance was feasible and active. CTCs were found to be prognostic in patients treated with B-DOC. Docetaxel-based

and platinum, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based combination chemotherapy has been shown to provide superior
overall survival (OS) and quality of life compared with
single-agent 5-FU.2
An important disadvantage of 5-FU-based and
cisplatin-based regimens is that prolonged hospitalization
is required for administration. Recent studies have
focused on the oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine and
newer platinum compounds such as oxaliplatin.3 The
Randomized ECF for Advanced and Locally Advanced
Esophagogastric Cancer 2 (REAL-2) study demonstrated
that 5-FU and cisplatin can be substituted by capecitabine
and oxaliplatin, which are at least noninferior and can be
administered on an outpatient basis.3
In recent years, attention has been focused on
taxane-containing triplet combinations.2,4 The addition
of docetaxel to cisplatin and 5-FU (DCF) improved time
to disease progression from 3.7 months to 5.6 months
(P<.001) and improved quality of life.4,5 However, an
important limitation of DCF was the high incidence of
severe treatment-related adverse events (AEs), with grade
3 neutropenia reported to occur in 82% of the patients.4
Therefore, reduced-dose (modified) DCF (mDCF) regimens have subsequently been investigated.6,7 We recently
reported the results of a phase IA/IB study of docetaxel at
a dose of 50 mg/m2, oxaliplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2,
and capecitabine at a dose of 850 mg/m2 twice daily
(DOC) every 3 weeks.7 At the established recommended
phase 2 dose, DOC was found to have a favorable safety
profile, with an incidence of severe neutropenia of 24%,
at therapeutic drug levels.7 DOC conferred a median
progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.5 months and an OS
of 11.0 months, which is in keeping with other studies
investigating DOC regimens.7 In addition, DOC could
be fully administered on an outpatient basis.
Bevacizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1
monoclonal antibody directed at the vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGF-A), which has been shown to
improve outcome in multiple solid tumors. In patients
with GC, bevacizumab improved PFS from 5.3 to 6.7
months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; P 5.004), but there was
no significant improvement in OS noted (from 10.1 to
12.1 months; HR, 0.87 [P 5.100]). Preplanned subgroup
analyses have demonstrated that non-Asian individuals
benefit more from bevacizumab than Asian individuals.8,9
In patients treated in Europe, bevacizumab was found to
improve PFS by 2.5 months, from 4.4 months to 6.9
months (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
0.54-0.93), and the objective response rate (ORR) was
also improved significantly (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI,

1.02-3.15).8 Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab
and capecitabine has been shown to be an effective strategy with which to delay disease progression in patients
with colorectal cancer without compromising quality of
life.10 In patients with GC, maintenance treatment could
similarly be beneficial, but to our knowledge only limited
data are available.11
Based on our experience with DOC and the potential to further improve patient outcomes through the
addition of bevacizumab and maintenance treatment, we
initiated a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study to
investigate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with
docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (B-DOC) plus
maintenance in patients with human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease. Patients
received 6 cycles of B-DOC followed by maintenance
with capecitabine and bevacizumab. The study was supported by pharmacogenetic analyses and measurements of
circulating tumor cells (CTCs).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Study Design

This prospective, multicenter, single-arm phase 2 study
was performed at 10 centers in the Netherlands (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01359397). Eligible patients
were aged 18 years; had histologically confirmed unresectable and/or metastatic (primary or recurrent) adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction;
measurable or evaluable disease according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version
1.1; hereafter referred to as RECIST 1.1)12; a World
Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 to
2; and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function
(including proteinuria 21). Patients were centrally
tested for tumor HER2 status before treatment (see online
Supporting Information), and patients with HER2negative disease (ie, those with immunohistochemistry
[IHC] 0 or 11 disease, regardless of silver in-situ hybridization [SISH] result; or IHC 21, SISH-negative disease)
were eligible. As per study protocol, patients with HER2positive disease could be included in a substudy to receive
B-DOC plus trastuzumab, the results of which are
reported separately.13 Major exclusion criteria were previous radiotherapy to the abdomen, active gastrointestinal
bleeding, arterial thrombosis or cerebrovascular accident
within 6 months before enrollment, therapeutic use of
anticoagulants or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,
and previous treatment for advanced disease (neoadjuvant
1435

Original Article

chemotherapy was permitted if administered >6 months
before enrollment).
The first 5 patients were treated at the primary study
center to monitor safety and recognize potential unexpected toxicities. An additional exclusion criterion was
added by protocol amendment to exclude patients at an
increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation in response to
treatment due to deep ulceration of the tumor as assessed
by endoscopy, when one of the first patients experienced
gastrointestinal perforation as a result of tumor response.
The study was approved by the medical ethics committees of the participating institutions and conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written
informed consent.

of quantification of the assay is 2 CTCs per 8 mL of
blood.13 Therefore, samples with <2 CTCs per 8 mL of
blood were considered CTC negative, and samples with
2 CTCs per 8 mL of blood were considered as CTC
positive. In view of stochastic sampling error at low numbers of CTCs, three 8-mL blood samples were drawn and
the average number of CTCs per 8 mL of blood was calculated to classify patients as CTC positive or negative.
Pharmacogenetics

Associations with PFS, OS, and toxicity were investigated
for polymorphisms in genes encoding pharmacokinetic and
dynamic enzymes related to fluoropyrimidine and platinum
pharmacology (see online Supporting Information).
Endpoints and Statistical Analysis

Treatment Plan and Assessments

Patients received outpatient treatment with bevacizumab
at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg (day 1), docetaxel at a dose of 50
mg/m2 (day 1), oxaliplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 (day
1), and capecitabine at a dose of 850 mg/m2 twice daily
(days 1-14) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Subsequently,
patients with stable disease or response continued to
receive maintenance treatment, with bevacizumab at a
dose of 7.5 mg/kg (day 1) and capecitabine at a dose of
1000 mg/m2 twice daily (days 1-14) every 3 weeks until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The
chemotherapy treatment plan was described in detail previously.7 Dose modifications for docetaxel, oxaliplatin,
and capecitabine were allowed as per protocol, and no
dose reductions of bevacizumab were performed. If individual study drugs had to be discontinued, patients could
continue on the remaining drugs if it was in the best interest of the patient. Prophylactic leukocyte growth factor
support was not allowed.
Screening assessments were performed within 14
days of treatment initiation. Tumor assessment and electrocardiogram were allowed 28 days before first drug
administration. During treatment, physical examination,
hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis were repeated
before each cycle. Tumor assessments (using computed
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) were performed before treatment and at the end of cycles 2, 4, and
6 followed by every 3 cycles.
Circulating Tumor Cells

Blood for the detection of CTCs was collected before
treatment for patients enrolled at the Netherlands Cancer
Institute. A fully validated fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay was used to enumerate CTCs.14 The lower limit
1436

The primary endpoint was PFS, and the secondary endpoints were safety, ORR, OS, disease control rate (DCR),
and translational research. PFS, OS, and safety analyses
were performed on the overall population of eligible
patients who had received at least 1 dose of all study
drugs.
A historical cohort of patients treated with DOC
between 2007 and 2010 in a phase IA/IB study performed
in 2 Dutch centers was found to have a PFS of 6.5
months.7 Therefore, a median PFS of 6.5 months was
considered insufficient to warrant further investigation of
B-DOC. A median PFS of 9.0 months was desired. A
total of 60 evaluable patients would have 67% power to
reject the null hypothesis of 6.5 months against 9.0
months at a 2-sided a of .05. The 95% CI was calculated
to determine whether it excluded 6.5 months.
Time-to-event endpoints were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method. PFS was defined as the time from
study registration to first documented disease progression
as per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever
came first. Patients who withdrew from or could not continue treatment due to AEs before documented disease
progression occurred were monitored for disease progression or, in case they were lost to follow-up, censored at
their date of last contact. OS was defined as the time from
study registration to death from any cause. Response was
evaluated according to RECIST 1.1.12 The ORR and
DCR were determined in the subset of patients with
measurable disease who had at least 1 on-treatment tumor
assessment. The 95% CIs for the ORR and DCR were
calculated using the exact method. The duration of
response was estimated in the subset of patients who
achieved a partial or complete response using the KaplanMeier method.

Bevacizumab in Advanced Gastric Cancer/Meulendijks

Multiple parameters related to drug exposure were
calculated for each drug, including the number of cycles
administered, the duration of treatment, the cumulative
dose administered, the percentage of patients with a dose
reduction, and the relative dose intensity (RDI) (methods
discussed in online Supporting Information).
For the CTC analysis, groups were compared with
regard to efficacy endpoints using log-rank tests and the
effects reported as HRs. For the pharmacogenetic analysis,
genotypes were compared using log-rank tests for efficacy
endpoints and the results reported as HRs. For associations with toxicity, groups were compared using chisquare tests. Multivariable analyses to investigate associations between CTCs and pharmacogenetic variants with
survival endpoints were performed using Cox regression,
with adjustment for age, sex, extent of disease, and WHO
performance status. An exploratory (multivariable) analysis to compare the outcomes of patients treated with BDOC in the current study with patients treated previously
with DOC was performed, adjusting for age, sex, extent
of disease, and WHO performance status. The threshold
for statistical significance was set at P <.05. No correction
for multiple comparisons was applied. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS statistical software (version
17.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and R statistical
software (version 3.1.1; R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
Patients

A total of 91 patients were screened for tumor HER2 status between March 2011 and September 2014, 63 of
whom (69%) were found to have HER2-negative disease.
Sixty patients were eligible and treated with B-DOC (Table 1). Two patients were ineligible due to an early decline
in WHO performance status and 1 patient was ineligible
due to elevated liver function tests. The median age of the
patients was 58 years (range, 27-75 years), and 43 of 60
patients (72%) were male. Approximately one-half of the
patients had a tumor localized in the stomach (48%),
whereas the remaining patients had a tumor at the gastroesophageal junction (52%).
Efficacy

The median follow-up was 19.0 months. At the clinical
data cutoff (April 20, 2015), a total of 43 patients (72%)
had reached the primary endpoint and 13 patients
remained on treatment. The remaining 4 patients were
censored for reasons other than remaining on treatment: 1
patient received a new treatment (chemoradiotherapy)
before documented disease progression on B-DOC, 1

by the reference dose intensity. If a patient had discontinued
a drug but remained on treatment with the remaining drugs,
the RDI for the drug in that cycle was considered to be 0%.
Open circles depict the median RDI among the patients

Safety

The reported treatment-related AEs that occurred as
grade 3 are listed in Table 2. All patients experienced at
least 1 treatment-related AE, 78% experienced a grade
3 treatment-related AE, and 18% of patients experienced a grade 4 AE. The most common grade 3 hematological toxicities were neutropenia (20%) and
leukocytopenia (18%). Febrile neutropenia occurred at
grade 3 in 1 patient (2%), and at grade 4 in 2 patients
(3%). The most prominent nonhematological grade 3
toxicities were diarrhea (15%), nausea/vomiting (15%),
fatigue (13%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy
(13%), all of which were limited to grade 3. A total of 35
treatment-related serious AEs were reported among 26
patients (43%).
Six patients (10%) discontinued treatment due to
treatment-related AEs. These cases were associated with
neuropathy (grade 2), dehydration (grade 3), esophageal
(tumor) perforation (grade 4), myocardial infarction
(grade 3), gastric hemorrhage (grade 5), and pneumosepsis (grade 5). All cases of treatment discontinuation due
to AEs occurred during the induction phase; no patients
discontinued due to treatment-related AEs during maintenance. Of the 2 cases with fatal toxicities (3%), one case
of sepsis occurred during cycle 5 (possibly related to
chemotherapy) and one case of gastric hemorrhage

84%-99%), the RDI for oxaliplatin was 89% (IQR, 83%97%), and the RDI for capecitabine was 73% (IQR,
59%-85%). The RDI over the course of treatment is
shown in Figure 2. Complete data regarding drug exposure are listed in Supporting Information Table S1. In
98% of all administered cycles, treatment could be
administered on an outpatient basis.
Circulating Tumor Cells

Twenty-two patients treated with the B-DOC regimen
were included in the CTC analysis. Two additional
patients who were screened as HER2 positive and were
treated with B-DOC plus trastuzumab participated in the
CTC investigations. Both patients were included in the
analysis (but were not included in any of the other analyses). In total, 16 of 24 patients (67%) were CTC positive
at baseline; the median number of CTCs per 8 mL of
blood was 36 (range, 2-428 CTCs) (Supporting Information Table S2). Clinical characteristics did not differ
between patients with and without detectable CTCs,
although CTC-positive patients more often tended to
have tumors located at the gastroesophageal junction.
Patients who were CTC positive had inferior PFS and OS
compared with patients who were CTC negative (Fig. 3).
The median PFS for patients who were CTC positive at
baseline was 7.9 months compared with 14.4 months for
patients who were CTC negative (HR, 3.8; 95% CI,
1.56-10.5 [P 5.007]). Similarly, the OS was 10.2 months
for CTC-positive patients and 21.5 months for CTCnegative patients (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.45-10.4 [P
5.014]). Multivariable analysis confirmed that CTCpositive status was associated with inferior PFS (HR, 6.7;
95% CI, 1.43-31.03 [P 5.016]) and a trend toward inferior OS (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 0.82-22.90 [P 5.084]).
Pharmacogenetic Analyses

A total of 56 of 60 patients (93%) participated in
the pharmacogenetic analysis. The TT genotype of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T was
strongly associated with inferior PFS (vs CC/CT: HR,
4.7; 95% CI, 1.75-12.8 [P 5.0007]) and OS (vs CC/CT:
HR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.12-16.5 [P 5.0001]) (Fig. 4). Multivariable analysis confirmed that PFS was inferior in
patients with the TT genotype (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.1313.7 [P 5.031]), as was OS (HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.37-16.8
[P 5.014]). None of the other polymorphisms were
found to be associated with PFS or OS. The MTHFR
677C>T polymorphism was also found to be associated
with gastrointestinal toxicity (Supporting Information

reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T genotypes and outcome. (A)
Progression-free survival (PFS) and (B) overall survival (OS)
of patients are shown according to MTHFR 677C>T genotype. Patients carrying a wild-type (CC) or heterozygous
(CT) genotype had a median PFS of 8.8 months versus 5.2
months for patients with a homozygous mutant (TT) genotype. Similarly, the OS was 15.2 months for patients with CC
or CT genotypes versus 5.8 months for those with a TT genotype. Multivariable analysis (with adjustment for age, sex,
extent of disease, and World Health Organization performance status) confirmed that PFS was inferior in patients with
the TT genotype (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval,
1.13-13.7 [P 5 .031]), as was OS (hazard ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-16.8 [P 5 .014]).

DISCUSSION
In this phase 2 study, treatment with B-DOC plus maintenance in patients with HER2-negative advanced GC
was associated with a PFS of 8.3 months (95% CI, 7.210.9 months), which was longer than the 6.5 months
observed in patients treated with DOC.7 The median OS
was 12.0 months (95% CI, 10.2-16.1 months), which is
close to the 11.0 months observed for DOC.7,8 Thus,
although the anticipated PFS of 9.0 months was not
achieved, there was a strong trend toward improvement in
PFS, and a lesser trend toward improved OS. The safety
profile of B-DOC was similar to that of DOC, which
compares favorably with the safety profile of DCF regimens.4,6 Neutropenia occurred as grade 3 in 20% of the
patients, which is a much lower incidence than the 82%
reported for DCF or the incidence of 61% reported for
mDCF.4,6 Febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of the
patients, which also is lower than the rate of 29% observed
for DCF and lower than the rate of 13% observed for
mDCF.4,6 The most important nonhematological grade
3 toxicities were diarrhea (15%), nausea/vomiting
(15%), fatigue (13%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy
(13%). These toxicities were all limited to grade 3, and
generally were well managed using standard supportive
measures. No new bevacizumab-related safety signals
were identified in the current study.
The results of the current study are in keeping with
the beneficial effect of bevacizumab on PFS demonstrated
in the AVAGAST study (from 5.3 to 6.7 months when
added to chemotherapy; P 5.004). Although the results
of the AVAGAST study demonstrated that bevacizumab
conferred a significant improvement in PFS, a similar
improvement in OS was not significant (from 10.1 to
12.1 months; P 5.100).8 We compared the outcome of
the patients treated with B-DOC plus maintenance in the
current study with patients treated previously with DOC
in an exploratory multivariable analysis (Supporting Information Table S4). The results of the analysis indicated
that patients treated with B-DOC were at a significantly
lower risk of disease progression compared with those
treated with DOC (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.32-0.87
[P 5.013]), but were not at a lower risk of death (HR,
1.0; 95% CI, 0.58-1.64 [P 5.924]) (Supporting Information Table S4). Although exploratory in nature, these
findings suggest that in an unselected population of
patients with GC treated with first-line therapy, bevacizumab provides a benefit with regard to PFS but not OS.
Whether this improvement in PFS translates into a meaningful clinical benefit and improved quality of life remains
to be further established.

Biomarker studies have shown that pretreatment
plasma concentrations of angiogenic factors are associated
with the response of patients with GC to treatment with
bevacizumab.15 In the AVAGAST population, non-Asian
patients with high plasma VEGF-A levels and/or low
neuropilin-1 levels were found to have a significant OS
benefit from treatment with bevacizumab (HR, 0.6 [95%
CI, 0.43-0.82] and HR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.41-0.86], respectively).15 Similar consistent findings have been demonstrated in patients with breast cancer,15,16 thereby
suggesting the validity of VEGF-A inhibition at least in
subsets of patients with GC and breast cancer.
The validity of VEGF inhibition as an anticancer
strategy in patients with GC is also demonstrated by the
efficacy of ramucirumab and apatinib, 2 other drugs that
inhibit the VEGF/VEGF receptor axis. Both drugs
improve OS in later lines of treatment.17,18 Of interest is
the finding that antiangiogenic drugs have demonstrated
a beneficial effect almost exclusively in later lines of treatment. The finding that VEGF-A levels in patients with
GC increase with progressing disease, and the indications
that VEGF-A levels are predictive of the effect of bevacizumab, might suggest that benefit from antiangiogenic
drugs is greater when used in patients with later stages of
the disease. Of note in this respect is the report of a
randomized phase 2 study of ramucirumab as the firstline treatment of GC in combination with FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin), which indicated that
ramucirumab did not improve PFS in this setting (HR,
0.98).19
Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab and capecitabine may have further contributed to the observed
improvement in PFS. Continuation of bevacizumab and
capecitabine after induction with B-DOC could theoretically result in a delay in tumor regrowth. In patients with
colorectal cancer, this theory is supported by data from
the CAIRO3 study (Treatment with Capecitabine and
Bevacizumab Versus Observation), which demonstrated
that maintenance significantly delayed PFS and was associated with a trend toward longer OS compared with observation after induction chemoimmunotherapy.10 In this
study, maintenance treatment was found to be feasible
and did not lead to excessive toxicity, a finding that is in
keeping with 2 previous studies.11,20 Feasibility of the
B-DOC regimen was further demonstrated by adequate
RDI for the administered drugs. The achieved RDI for
capecitabine during the first 6 cycles was somewhat lower
than expected (75%-80%), but is in keeping with a recent
study that demonstrated that the RDI was 74% in
patients treated with a similar DOC regimen.21

Original Article

Administering B-DOC on an outpatient basis was found
to be feasible in a majority of cycles (98%).
The results of translational studies indicated that
patients with detectable CTCs had significantly inferior
PFS (HR, 3.8; P 5.007) and OS (HR, 3.4; P 5.014)
compared with patients without detectable CTCs at baseline, thereby confirming the potential usefulness of CTCs
as a prognostic marker in patients with GC.22 The
MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism was found to be associated with outcome, with the TT genotype conferring inferior PFS and OS. The T allele is associated with a
reduction in MTHFR activity, which leads to higher concentrations of 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate and therefore would be expected to lead to a greater cytotoxic effect
of 5-FU as a result of stabilization of the ternary complex
between thymidylate synthase and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine
monophosphate.23,24 However, the T allele also has been
found to be associated with an increased risk of GC development, suggesting that MTHFR 677C>T might have
both a prognostic and a predictive effect on outcome.25
The findings in the current study therefore could be
explained by the fact that MTHFR has both a prognostic
and a predictive effect, which act in opposing directions
and could have a different magnitude depending on the
population studied.
A limitation of the current study is that we compared outcome with a historical cohort of patients.
Although an indirect comparison, the population treated
with DOC was highly similar (treated in the same country
only several years earlier, without any major changes in
clinical practice occurring during this period) and therefore we believe the risk of selection bias as a result of the
historical comparison is relatively low. The fact that we
selected HER2-negative patients for this study did introduce selection bias because the patients treated with DOC
were not selected based on HER2 status. However, the
risk of positively affecting outcome by enrichment with
HER2-negative tumors is most likely low because only a
percentage of the patients were HER2 positive and
because a recent meta-analysis indicated that HER2 status
was not associated with outcome in patients with GC
(HR, 0.97 [P 5.63] for OS).26
The results of the current study confirm that DOC
is a safe and efficacious treatment for patients with GC,
and can be combined with nonchemotherapeutic anticancer drugs such as bevacizumab. B-DOC chemotherapy
followed by maintenance treatment with bevacizumab
plus capecitabine was found to confer a modest improvement in PFS in comparison with DOC administered in a
historical cohort of patients. The therapeutic value of bev1442

acizumab and of maintenance treatment need to be confirmed in a randomized controlled study.
