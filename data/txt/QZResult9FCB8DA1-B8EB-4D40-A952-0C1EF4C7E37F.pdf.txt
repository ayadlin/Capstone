Abstract
DNA methylation is commonly thought of as a "molecular lock" that leads to permanent gene silencing. To
investigate this notion, we tested 24 different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on colon cancer cells that
harbor a GFP locus stably integrated and silenced by a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. We
found that HDACi efﬁciently reactivated expression of GFP and many other endogenous genes silenced by DNA
hypermethylation. After treatment, all promoters were marked with active chromatin, yet DNA hypermethylation
did not change. Thus, DNA methylation could not prevent gene reactivation by drug-induced resetting of the
chromatin state. In evaluating the relative contribution of DNA methylation and histone modiﬁcations to stable
gene silencing, we followed expression levels of GFP and other genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation over time
after treatment with HDACi or DNA-demethylating drugs. Reactivation of methylated loci by HDACi was
detectable for only 2 weeks, whereas DNA-demethylating drugs induced permanent epigenetic reprogramming.
Therefore, DNA methylation cannot be considered as a lock for gene expression but rather as a memory signal for
long-term maintenance of gene silencing. These ﬁndings deﬁne chromatin as an important druggable target for
cancer epigenetic therapy and suggest that removal of DNA methylation signals is required to achieve long-term
gene reactivation. Cancer Res; 72(5); 1170–81. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Epigenetic marks such as histone modiﬁcations and
DNA methylation are involved in cell memory expression
patterns which are transmitted through cell division (1).
Chromatin modiﬁcations are required in all organisms
whereas DNA methylation is not present in some lower
organisms such as worms and ﬂies, suggesting that chromatin has a broader epigenetic function in gene regulation
(1). Histone acetylation is associated with open chromatin
and gene expression whereas removal of acetyl groups by
histone deacetylases is observed in inactive chromatin.
In higher organisms, DNA methylation plays an important
role in several physiologic processes, including X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and silencing of
germ cell–speciﬁc genes and repetitive elements (2). In

cancer, tumor suppressor genes (TSG) are silenced by both
DNA hypermethylation and chromatin-repressive marks
(2, 3).
A common hypothesis is that DNA methylation serves as a
"molecular lock" that prevents reprogramming and is responsible for stable gene silencing (1, 4, 5). This concept was built on
indirect observations whereby hypermethylated genes in cancer cells could be reactivated only after removal of promoter
DNA hypermethylation using hypomethylating drugs such as
decitabine (5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine, 5-aza-CdR). In contrast,
chromatin acetylation induced by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as trichostatin A (TSA), could not reactivate
hypermethylated genes in cancer cells (6–8). However, more
recently, some reports have shown that HDACi, such as TSA
and depsipeptide, produce gene reactivation from hypermethylated promoters without any changes in DNA methylation at the promoter level (9–12). Because these reports were
against the current paradigm, a more detailed look at this issue
was needed.
One of the problems in studying DNA methylation–
associated silencing of TSG is that reactivation of these
genes can impair cellular growth and be difﬁcult to detect
and quantitate. A selectable system was recently described
to overcome this issue. YB5 cells are derived from the SW48
colon cancer cell line transfected with a GFP driven by a
hypermethylated cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter packaged into inactive chromatin. YB5 carries a single copy of
CMV/GFP stably integrated in chromosome 1. GFP can be

reactivated in YB5 cells by treatment with 5-aza-CdR when
its promoter region is demethylated and also marked by
active chromatin signals characterized by H3K9-acetylation, low level of H3K27 trimethylation, and low nucleosome density (13).
In this article, we use YB5 cells (and 5 other cancer cell lines)
to show that the vast majority of HDACi tested can reactivate
genes silenced by promoter hypermethylation without detectable changes in DNA methylation. We further show that while
DNA methylation cannot prevent gene activation by chromatin
reprogramming, it is essential for long-term gene silencing.

synthesis used the same amount of RNA after treatment with
different drugs. All primers, except GFP primers that were
described previously (13), are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
50 -Rapid ampliﬁcation of cDNA ends (50 -RACE) was done as
previously described (13).
DNA extraction and DNA methylation analysis
DNA extraction and bisulﬁte conversion, pyrosequencing,
and bisulﬁte cloning/sequencing were carried out as previously described (13). All primers are listed in Supplementary
Table S1, except for all GFP primers that were described
previously (13).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatments
All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. Cell lines were authenticated at MD Anderson
Cancer Center with short tandem repeat PCR method. YB5
cell line is a colon cancer cell line generated from SW48 as
previously described (13). YB5 cell line was cultured in L-15
medium, whereas MCF-7, K562, MDA-MD-231, and PC-3 cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640. Both cell culture media contained
10% FBS and 100 mg/mL penicillin/streptomycin solution.
Cells growing in log phase were treated with decitabine
(5-aza-CdR) at 50 nmol/L for 72 hours. Drug and medium
were replaced every day. Cells were cultured an additional
24 hours without drug prior to analysis. HDACi were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, or PBS according the manufacturers' recommendations. HDACi were added for 24 hours
at various concentrations prior to analysis.
Histone extraction and Western blot analyses
Total protein extracts were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer as described previously (14)
in the presence of sodium butyrate (5 mmol/L) to avoid in vitro
histone deacetylation and resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE. Antibodies used were H3K9-acetylation (07–352; Millipore),
H4K16-acetylation (39168; Active motif), and total H3 (ab1791
Abcam).
Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis and cell
sorting
YB5 cells were trypsinized and stained with propidium
iodide. GFP and propidium iodide ﬂuorescence were measured
by Gallios ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were
analyzed using Kaluza software. GFP cell sorting was conducted using BD FACSAriaII. GFP ﬂuorescence of samples was
analyzed post-sorting to assess the purity of the sorted cells.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, quantitative real-time
PCR
Total RNA (2 mg) was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen)
and cDNA was synthesized using High-Capacity cDNA Kit
(Applied Biosystems). Quantiﬁcation of cDNA was done by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the Universal PCR Master Mix
(Bio-Rad) using ABI Prism 7900HT. Results were obtained from
at least 3 independent experiments where each sample was
analyzed in duplicate. 18S was used as a reference gene. cDNA

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was conducted
as described previously (14). Antibodies used were anti–
histone H3 (ab1791; Abcam), anti–histone H3K9-acetylation
(07–352; Millipore), anti–histone H3K27 trimethylation (07–
449; Millipore), anti-histone H3K4 trimethylation (17–614;
Millipore), anti-histone H3K36 trimethylation (ab9050;
Abcam), and anti-IgG (ab46540; Abcam). Quantiﬁcation of
ChIP DNA was done by qPCR and primers/probes are listed
in Supplementary Table S1. Each ChIP assay was validated
using targets for the various modiﬁcations (ACTB for active
histone mark and LINE-1 for inactive histone mark). The
value of each histone modiﬁcation was determined by H3
and IgG normalization using the equation fold enrichment ¼
2[Ct(Ab)Ct(H3)]  2[Ct(IgG)Ct(H3)].
Gene expression and DNA methylation microarrays
Gene expression analysis was conducted using the Agilent
Whole Genome Array (G4112F) that was scanned using the
Agilent G2505B Scanner. Data represent the average expression level of 2 independent experiments. DNA methylation
analysis using high-throughput methylation proﬁling by MCA
coupled to CpG island microarray (MCAM) was conducted as
described previously (15). After analysis, genes with M values
more than 1.3 were considered methylated. Microarray data
sets were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database with the accession number GSE34429.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were assessed using the
Student t test. A 2-sided P value of 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
HDACi induce GFP reactivation from a DNA
hypermethylated promoter
To examine the effects of HDACi on gene silencing by DNA
methylation, YB5 cells were treated with 24 different HDACi
that belong to 8 different chemical classes in a wide range of
concentrations (Table 1) and 17 of them reactivated GFP.
Although GFP reactivation was detected in a wide range of
concentrations (even at high doses, Table 1), the subsequent
experiments were carried out at doses where the percentage of
dead cells after treatment was less than 30% and where GFP

reactivation was the highest as detected by ﬂuorescenceactivated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis. Following treatment
with depsipeptide (for 24 hours at 20 nmol/L), GFP expression
was detectable in about 50% of cells as seen by ﬂuorescent
microscopy (Fig. 1A), quantiﬁed by FACS analysis (Fig. 1B), and
associated with extensive global histone acetylation (Fig. 1C).
HDACi produced GFP mRNA and GFP ﬂuorescence as early as
12 hours after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
GFP reactivation was not speciﬁc to a molecular structure or
chemical class of these epigenetic drugs as the vast majority of
HDACi tested activated this hypermethylated locus (Fig. 1D
and Table 1). Moreover, GFP ﬂuorescence and mRNA levels
were stronger after a 24-hour treatment with HDACi than after
a 72-hour treatment with 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 1D and E). We
conﬁrmed by 50 -RACE experiments that GFP mRNA originated
from its own promoter and not from an alternative transcription start site (data not shown).
It has previously been suggested that HDACi can lead to
DNA demethylation (16–18). To test this, DNA methylation
levels were measured after treatment with 7 different HDACi
and 5-aza-CdR was used as a control for DNA hypomethylation.
Analyses were conducted by bisulﬁte pyrosequencing and
cloning/sequencing at the GFP promoter (Fig. 2A and B,

respectively). No changes were detected after treatment with
any of the HDACi tested after 24 hours of treatment. Similarly,
there were no effects on global DNA methylation assessed by
bisulﬁte pyrosequencing of LINE-1 methylation after 24 hours
of treatment (Fig. 2C) or 10 days following treatment (Fig. 2D).
Only treatment with 5-aza-CdR reduced DNA methylation
levels. These results and others (19) clearly show that HDACi
do not alter DNA methylation levels of cancer cells. Thus,
HDACi can induce gene reactivation through a DNA hypermethylated promoter without any change in DNA methylation
levels. These results do not support the lock hypothesis and are
in agreement with more recent ﬁndings showing that HDACi
can reactivate hypermethylated genes.
HDACi induce gene reactivation of endogenous genes
silenced by promoter DNA hypermethylation
Because these data are not in agreement with other studies
on gene reactivation induced by HDACi (6, 7), we asked
whether this effect was speciﬁc to the GFP locus or could be
observed in other methylated genes in various cancer cell lines.
First, we analyzed in YB5 cells gene reactivation of other
hypermethylated genes in response to depsipeptide (Fig. 3A)
and other HDACi (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). For this,

we selected 7 TSGs silenced by DNA hypermethylation in YB5
cells (85%–100% methylation as detected by bisulﬁte pyrosequencing). These play roles in mediating cell adhesion
(CDH13), metastasis (TIMP-3), cell cycle (P16), DNA mismatch
repair (MLH1), Wnt pathway signaling (WIF-1), mitogen—
activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling (DOK5), and cell
differentiation (RAR-b). Among these, all but one (RAR-b) are
driven by promoter CpG islands (CGI; ref. 20). These genes are
epigenetically inactivated in many cancers. Twenty-four hours
of treatment with depsipeptide and other HDACi reactivated
all these hypermethylated genes as detected by qPCR (Fig. 3A
and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), whereas DNA methylation levels did not change as compared with untreated cells
(Fig. 3B). These results were extended to 4 other cancer cell
lines [K562, a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line;

NPM2, RASSF1A, DOK5, and PDLIM4; Supplementary Fig. S3A–
S3D) whose promoter methylation levels vary between 65%
and 100% methylation as detected by pyrosequencing. Most of
them showed reactivation after HDACi treatment. The induction of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, by HDACi was
used as a positive control for HDACi activity as it is considered
as a hallmark of the effect of HDACi on gene expression.
Our data are in agreement with previous reports on single
genes that HDACi, such as TSA, phenylbutyrate, and LBH589
(9, 11, 12, 21, 22), or SIRT1 inhibition (10) can induce gene
reactivation of hypermethylated genes without alteration
in DNA methylation. Our ﬁndings on numerous genes and
in different cancer cell lines show that chromatin acetylation

induced by HDACi overcomes DNA hypermethylation silencing and induces gene reactivation. Altogether, these data show
that chromatin remodeling allows a subset of TSGs silenced by
DNA hypermethylation to be reactivated in response to HDACi.
Chromatin remodeling despite DNA hypermethylation
Because HDACi-induced gene reactivation was not associated with DNA demethylation, we investigated the effect of the
treatment on chromatin modiﬁcations at the promoter regions
of these hypermethylated genes. We conducted ChIP assays

regardless of DNA methylation status, gene reactivation is
associated with a promoter region marked by active chromatin
marks and low nucleosome density (13). Following depsipeptide treatment, all promoter regions of GFP, CDH13, MLH1, and
WIF-1 showed an increase in activating marks (1.5- to 24.5-fold)

such as H3K9-Ac (Fig. 4A), H3K4-me3 (Fig. 4B), and H3K36me3 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, H3K27-me3, a surrogate for
chromatin inactivated by polycomb, was reduced after
depsipeptide treatment by 1.4- to 4-fold (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, depsipeptide treatment did not seem to have
modiﬁed nucleosome density (measured by ChIP-PCR of
H3/input) on the promoter region of these genes (data not
shown). To rule out indirect effects through other chromatin regulators, we measured the expression of DNMT1,
DNMT3a, DNMT3b, DNMT3L, DROSHA, DICER, TET1, TET2,
and EZH2. We found that most did not change signiﬁcantly
after depsipeptide treatment (Fig. 3A). These data show
that HDACi directly induced chromatin remodeling and
this was associated with gene reactivation from DNA
hypermethylated promoters.

Genome-wide effects of depsipeptide on
hypermethylated genes
We next investigated on a genomic scale the effect of
depsipeptide on gene reactivation of hypermethylated genes.
We combined the data of 2 independent gene expression
microarrays of untreated and depsipeptide-treated YB5 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4A) with whole genome DNA methylation data using MCAM (Supplementary Fig. S4B; ref. 15). As
previously reported by other groups (23, 24), we found that
HDACi increased the expression of 11% of the genes with the
same amount of genes being repressed (11%; Supplementary
Fig. S4D). Whole genome methylation data showed that this
colon cancer cell line has more than 330 detectable hypermethylated promoter CGIs (i.e., 6% of the gene promoters on
the array; Supplementary Fig. S4B). When combining the data

of both gene expression and DNA methylation microarrays, we
could analyze gene expression and DNA methylation of more
than 4,300 genes (Supplementary Fig. S4C). In this gene list, 258
genes showed promoter DNA hypermethylation and 8% (21
genes) of these were reactivated following HDACi treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). Considering that 80% to 90%
of hypermethylated genes in cancer are not expressed in
normal tissues and thus lack the appropriate transcription
factor for activation, our data suggest that the majority of
"inducible" genes are actually induced by HDACi (25). In
contrast, 14% of the unmethylated genes could be reactivated
by treatment with depsipeptide.
DNA methylation is a long-term memory signal for gene
silencing
The data described so far show that rapid activation of a
DNA hypermethylated promoter is possible with strong druginduced chromatin acetylation. These results raise the question of the importance of DNA methylation in gene silencing.

To study the relative contribution of DNA methylation versus
chromatin modiﬁcations in gene silencing, we compared the
long-term effects of depsipeptide and 5-aza-CdR treatment on
gene expression and DNA methylation. YB5 cells were treated
with depsipeptide (24 hours) or 5-aza-CdR (72 hours) and were
then subjected to cell sorting to obtain enriched GFP-positive
cell populations (purity 70% of GFPþ cells for each treatment
conditions). GFP-positive cells were cultured post-sorting
without drugs and GFP expression was followed for more than
3 months by FACS analysis (Fig. 5A). During the ﬁrst week postsorting, the population of depsipeptide-treated YB5 cells was
mostly GFP-positive. Ten days post-sorting, approximately
60% of the cells treated with depsipeptide lost GFP expression
and 2 weeks posttreatment, GFP expression was rare among
these cells. These data were conﬁrmed with other HDACi such
as valproic acid (VPA), apicidin, Cay-10398, and TSA (data not
shown). GFP expression was undetectable 25 days following
depsipeptide treatment and was similar to untreated cells for
the rest of the experiment.

DNA Methylation Is Not a Lock for Gene Expression

cells were either treated for 24 hours
with depsipeptide (Depsi) at 20 nmol/
L or for 72 hours with 5-aza-CdR at
50 nmol/L. GFP-positive cells were
enriched by cell sorting (purity
70%). Time course of GFP
ﬂuorescence was measured by
FACS and expressed as a
percentage of GFP ﬂuorescence

expression levels were measured by
qPCR in YB5 untreated cells or

depsipeptide or 5-aza-CdR at the
time indicated on the graph (n ¼ 3).

Results obtained with YB5 cells treated with 5-aza-CdR
exhibited a different pattern (Fig. 5A). For the ﬁrst week, the
vast majority of the cells exhibited GFP ﬂuorescence. Then, the
percentage of cells showing GFP ﬂuorescence decreased to
50% and 35% after 10 days and 25 days posttreatment, respectively. The number of GFP-positive cells decreased slowly
thereafter, and after 3 months, 3% of YB5 cells treated with
5-aza-CdR still exhibited GFP ﬂuorescence (Fig. 5A). We similarly investigated the RNA expression of several hypermethylated genes including GFP (Fig. 5B), MLH1 (Fig. 5C), CDH13
(Supplementary Fig. S5A), WIF-1 (Supplementary Fig. S5B), and
TIMP-3 (Supplementary Fig. S5C) and found that gene expression was activated immediately by treatment with either

depsipeptide treatment whereas it was maintained following
treatment with 5-aza-CdR for up to 9 weeks. Interestingly,
other chromatin modiﬁers, such as histone methyltransferase
inhibitors, were previously shown to induce transient gene
activation which returned to the original state upon drug
removal (26). As previously mentioned, after depsipeptide
treatment, DNA methylation in the promoter regions of these
hypermethylated genes did not change. In contrast, after 5-azaCdR treatment, methylation levels decreased signiﬁcantly at
GFP (Fig. 5D), MLH1 (Fig. 5E), CDH13 (Supplementary Fig.
S5D), WIF-1 (Supplementary Fig. S5E), TIMP-3 (Supplementary
Fig. S5F), and LINE-1 (Supplementary Fig. S5G).
The gradual loss of GFP expression after 5-aza-CdR
withdrawal coincided with gradual remethylation of the

CMV promoter. Although it has been reported that the
p16CDKN2A/INK4 locus was remethylated after 5-aza-CdR removal, it has been suggested that the apparent remethylation was
due to clonal replacement by a subset of cancer cells that were
not affected by 5-aza-CdR (19, 27). Cells treated with hypomethylating agents tend to have a longer cell cycle because of
the reexpression of growth regulatory signals. Therefore, hypomethylated cell populations can be easily replaced by more
rapidly growing methylated populations, which can bias the
measurement of DNA methylation (19). To address this issue,
we carried out 2 series of cell-sorting experiments using YB5
cells cultured 9 weeks without drug following initial 5-aza-CdR
treatment (Fig. 6A). The purity of the sorted GFP-positive cells
exceeded 90% whereas the GFP-negative cells contained only
0.2% GFP-positive cells. Gene expression and DNA methylation
analysis of GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells at 9 weeks
posttreatment revealed that gene reactivation in GFP-positive
cells (Fig. 6B) was at this late time point associated with an
unmethylated promoter region with an average methylation of
15% (Fig. 6C). GFP-negative cells exhibited 1,000 times less GFP
mRNA and a promoter closer to the methylation level of
untreated cells with an average methylation of 66% (Fig. 6B
and C). This gene expression pattern was also observed for
other TSG such as TIMP-3, CDH13, and MLH1 whereas their
DNA methylation level was reduced in the GFP-positive and
GFP-negative cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6F). Global DNA
methylation measured by the LINE-1 assay did not change
signiﬁcantly between untreated cells, GFP-positive, and GFPnegative cells (Supplementary Fig. S6G).
To eliminate the effect of clonal replacement, we carried out
cell-sorting and single cloning experiments (Fig. 6D). After
clonal expansion of these single clones to obtain enough cells
(2 weeks), we monitored their GFP ﬂuorescence over time
(Fig. 6D, black bars) as compared with sorted cells obtained
after 5-aza-CdR treatment when the purity was about 70% (Fig.
6D, white bars) and 9 weeks after treatment when the purity
exceeded 90% (Fig. 6D, gray bars). Single-cell clones of these
GFP-positive YB5 cells obtained 9 weeks after 5-aza-CdR
without drugs revealed that 92% to 97% stably express GFP
for up to 6 months posttreatment showing stable epigenetic
reprogramming (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, the GFP promoter
region was completely demethylated in these GFP-positive
clones (Fig. 6C). These results clearly show that DNA methylation is the molecular mechanism responsible for long-term
gene silencing. Thus, full epigenetic reprogramming and
switching from the silent to the expressed state can be accomplished by complete promoter demethylation which is correlated with RNA pol II occupancy (28).

Discussion
Early studies have reported that TSG silenced by promoter
DNA hypermethylation could be reactivated only after the
removal of methylation marks. In these studies, treatment
with TSA, an HDACi, could not produce gene reactivation of
genes silenced by promoter DNA hypermethylation (6, 7). On
the basis of these indirect observations, the function of promoter DNA methylation, as a signal for gene silencing, has been

1178

Cancer Res; 72(5) March 1, 2012

considered as a "lock" for gene expression. However, other
studies have reported that hypermethylated genes can be
reactivated by TSA and other HDACi without any loss in
promoter DNA methylation (9–12). These reports put in jeopardy the lock hypothesis which has been the paradigm for more
than a decade. Hence, we chose to investigate this issue by
looking at the effects of more than 20 different HDACi on
reactivation of genes silenced by promoter DNA methylation.
Using the well-characterized YB5 system and other cancer
cell lines, we discovered that most of the HDACi tested could
reactivate hypermethylated genes in a dose-dependent pattern
regarding their chemical class and HDAC afﬁnity. DNA methylation analysis revealed that gene reactivation was generated
without any loss of promoter DNA methylation. Methylation
levels were carefully assessed before and after treatment by
pyrosequencing and bisulﬁte cloning sequencing as it was
reported that HDACi could potentially reduce DNA methylation levels by nonspeciﬁc mechanisms (16–18). However, our
study, as well as others (19), show that methylation levels did
not change 24 hours after HDACi exposure or several days
posttreatment. Therefore, these data conﬁrm that HDACi can
reactivate gene expression through hypermethylated promoters, which shows that DNA methylation does not lock gene
expression in that it does not prevent reactivation by chromatin remodeling. It is not clear why previous studies reported
that HDACi do not reactivate the expression of hypermethylated genes, although it may relate to the use of low doses of
HDACi for short periods of time and the use of insensitive
methods for gene expression analysis. Alternately, it is possible
that some genes/cell lines are resistant to this effect, although
we observed it for most genes and most cell lines tested.
The fact that DNA methylation does not lock gene expression raises the question of the relative contribution of DNA
methylation and chromatin modiﬁcations to gene silencing.
The YB5 system was particularly suitable to investigate this
issue as after treatment with either depsipeptide or with 5-azaCdR, we were able to sort the GFP-expressing cells and monitor
GFP ﬂuorescence for several months. We discovered that a
treatment with HDACi can transiently reactivate hypermethylated genes (GFP and other TSG) for up to 2 weeks without any
changes in DNA methylation level in their promoter regions.
On the other hand, treatment with 5-aza-CdR leads to gene
reactivation of GFP and other TSG for several months. Moreover, the decline in GFP-expressing cells after 5-aza-CdR,
thought largely to be due to remethylation, is in fact attributable, in part, to clonal replacement by YB5 cells that are
methylated and do not express GFP. Indeed, cell sorting and
single-cell cloning 9 weeks after drug removal led to clones
where the promoter region was completely demethylated and
expression permanently on. Thus, efﬁcient demethylation
leads to permanent gene reactivation, showing that DNA
methylation provides a memory signal for the silent state.
Our data show that the respective roles of DNA methylation
and chromatin remodeling can be completely separated using
the YB5 selectable system. The chromatin state determines the
immediate gene expression potential, whereas DNA methylation provides a long-term memory for gene silencing. Thus,
DNA methylation does not provide a "lock" function as

DNA Methylation Is Not a Lock for Gene Expression

Figure 6. DNA methylation serves
as a mechanism for gene expression
memory. Cell sorting of GFP-positive
cells was conducted 9 weeks
following 5-aza-CdR treatment. A,
YB5 cells were sorted twice for
maximum of purity. GFP-negative
cells (left; 0.2% of GFP-positive cells)
and GFP-positive cells (right; 90% of
GFP-positive cells) were expanded
prior to molecular analysis of gene
expression and DNA methylation. B,
GFP expression measured by qPCR
of YB5 cells untreated or sorted GFPpositive and GFP-negative, 9 weeks
after 5-aza-CdR treatment. C, DNA
methylation analysis was conducted
by pyrosequencing of the entire GFP
promoter region of these sorted YB5
cells. Interestingly, average DNA
methylation levels at this promoter
were 81% and 66% in untreated cells
and GFP-negative cells,
respectively. Average DNA
methylation level in this locus was
only 15% in GFP-positive cells.
Moreover, methylation level of single
clones isolated by cell sorting, 9
weeks following 5-aza-CdR
treatment, showed 5% methylation
levels which are similar to the
background of the assay. D, timedependent GFP expression
measured by FACS analysis on YB5
cells sorted immediately following 5aza-CdR treatment at 70% purity of
GFP-positive cells (left), 9 weeks
after 5-aza-CdR treatment after 2
additional rounds of cell sorting, at
90% purity of GFP-positive cells
(middle), and after single-cell cloning

weeks after the initial 5-aza-CdR
treatment (right). PI, propidium

previously thought because gene expression can be restored
by drug-induced chromatin modiﬁcations without any DNA
demethylation (i.e., without breaking the lock). Rather, DNA
methylation provides a "spring" function, which does not
suppress gene expression but brings back silencing, presumably through the previously deﬁned order of events: methyl-

binding protein recruitment, histone deacetylation, histone
methylation, HP1 binding, and so on (3). This explains why
physiologically, DNA methylation at promoter CGIs is only
involved when very long-term silencing is required and why it
provides such a selective advantage to cancer cells when
TSGs are silenced by this mechanism (3). Interestingly,

after treatment with HDACi, gene expression is not sufﬁcient
to lead to permanent expression and DNA demethylation. It is
possible that gene reactivation induced by HDACi may be
caused by either (i) bypassing transcription factors, whereby
histone acetylation will directly trigger RNA pol II activation
leading to reactivation or (ii) transient binding of transcription
factors to promoter regions, with gene silencing rapidly
restored by repressive signals arising from DNA methylation.
Restoring a silenced state is likely when histones are replaced
during cell divisions in the face of persistent DNA methylation.
Importantly, after the treatment with hypomethylating drugs,
it has been previously shown that removal of DNA methylation
marks will allow the binding of transcription factors leading to
permanent epigenetic resetting promoting the emergence of
stably reactivated clones. This was shown by 5-aza-CdR–
induced DNA demethylation in YB5 cells where the CREB
transcription factor bound only the CMV promoter only when
it was hypomethylated (13).
These data have implications for therapeutic intervention.
We show that genes silenced by DNA hypermethylation in
cancer can be signiﬁcantly but transiently reactivated
through chromatin remodeling without any changes in DNA
methylation and this may be part of the clinical mechanisms

of action of HDACi. Moreover, our results provide a molecular explanation for the synergy between decitabine and
HDACi (6, 29) in which the combination induces more
complete epigenetic reprogramming. Finally, while these
ﬁndings validate chromatin as a key target for therapeutic
intervention in cancer, they also suggest that stable reprogramming may require the removal of DNA methylation
signals.
