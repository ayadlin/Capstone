Summary

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Impediments to DNA replication are known to induce gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCR)
and copy number variations (CNV). GCRs/CNVs underlie human genomic disorders1 and are a
feature of cancer2. During cancer development environmental factors and oncogene-driven
proliferation promote replication stress. Resulting GCRs/CNVs are proposed to contribute to
cancer development and therapy resistance3. When stress arrests replication, the replisome
remains associated with the fork DNA (stalled fork) and is protected by the inter-S phase
checkpoint. Stalled forks efficiently resume when the stress is relieved. However, if the
polymerases dissociate from the fork (fork collapse) or the fork structure breaks (broken fork),
replication restart can proceed either by homologous recombination (HR) or microhomologyprimed re-initiation (FoSTeS/MMBIR)4,5. Here we ascertain the consequences of replication with
a fork restarted by HR. We identify a new mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement:
recombination-restarted forks have an exceptionally high propensity to execute a U-turn at small
inverted repeats (up to 1:40 replication events). We propose that the error-prone nature of restarted
forks contributes to the generation of GCRs and gene amplification in cancer and to non-recurrent
CNVs in genomic disorders.
In eukaryotes, multiple origins are licenced but only a subset fire. If one fork collapses,
replication is completed by a converging fork6. Alternatively, if both converging forks
collapse, dormant origins can fire to rescue the situation7. However, when converging forks
collapse without an intervening dormant origin, i.e. at a fragile site8,9, or if a single fork
collapses at a unidirectionally-replicated locus10 one replisome will likely be rebuilt by HR.
To study replication fork collapse and restart we use a programmed replication terminator
sequence (RTS1) to arrest the replisome at a defined genomic locus in fission yeast11,12.
Fork arrest at RTS1 is controlled by regulating rtf1+ transcription11. Rtf1, a Myb-like DNA
binding protein, is required for arrest at RTS1. Following induction >90% of forks arrest at
RTS1 and require HR proteins to restart13.
In S. pombe collapsed forks restart by an HR-dependent, but double strand breakindependent, mechanism12,13. Our model (Supp. Figure S1) suggests HR proteins associate
with the nascent strand behind the collapsed fork and subsequent strand invasion at the
collapse site facilitates accurate HR-dependent fork restart with the correct template.
However, if a DNA sequence homologous to the collapse site is nearby, an erroneous strand

invasion can occur such that replication reinitiates ectopically. This leads to non-allelic
homologous recombination (NAHR)11-13. When the homologous sequences are in an
inverted repeat (IR) orientation, NAHR associated with inaccurate restart results in acentric
and dicentric isochromosomes13. We also observed that, when the fork barrier sequence
formed the flanking regions of a small palindrome12, GCR rates increased ~10 fold (contrast
RuraR and RuiuR constructs, Suppl. Figure S2). The main distinction between the two
constructs is that RuiuR contains RTS1 in context of the 5.3kb palindrome as opposed to an
IR separated by 1.8kb (RuraR). We thus speculated that, upon NAHR, branch migration of
the invading strand (which is not possible in the IR construct) formed a single HJ at the
palindrome centre which drove the increased chromosome rearrangement.
To prevent the predicted half-crossover migrating in RuiuR to the palindrome centre we
replaced 550bp of the centromere-proximal ura4+ gene with 0.2 or 1.8kb of his3+ creating
Rpal1R and Rpal2R (Figure 1A). To prevent any possibility of rearrangement by NAHR we
created two further constructs in which the telomere-proximal RTS1 sequences of Rpal1R
and Rpal2R were replaced with three copies of rDNA fork barrier, Ter2/3, to create Tpal1R
and Tpal2R. Ter2/3 serves simply to pause the converging fork, allowing more time for the
RTS1-collapsed fork to restart. Ter2/3 differs from RTS1 in sequence and arrests forks in an
Rtf1-independent fashion14,15 (Suppl. Figure S3A,B). Unlike RTS1, where forks collapse
and require HR to rebuild the replisome for restart, forks pause transiently at Ter2/3, do not
require HR for resumption and the arrest site does not accumulate Rad52. GCRs are thus not
induced (Suppl. Figure S3C-F).
To assay for GCRs, fork arrest was induced at RTS1 by inducing Rtf1 (Ter2/3 arrest is
constitutive) and genomic DNA analysed by Southern blot. We predicted no GCRs in strains
with a single RTS1 (Tpal1R and Tpal2R) and were interested to establish if double RTS1
constructs (Rpal1R and Rpal2R) significantly reduced GCR levels (Figure 1A).
Surprisingly, all four constructs generated GCRs in an RTS1 fork arrest-dependent manner
(Figure 1B,C). Double RTS1 systems accumulated 25-30% GCRs, similar to that observed
in RuiuR, while single RTS1 strains showed ~5-15% rearrangement.

NAHR between RTS1 sequences occurring upon restart should produce dicentric
chromosomes with an expected BglII fragment of 15.2kb (Rpal1R) or 15.8kb (Rpal2R). The
observed fragment lengths were 14.8kb (Rpal1R) and 18kb (Rpal2R). These correspond to
double the size from the cen-proximal BglII site to the palindrome centre. Identical size
fragments are observed in the corresponding single RTS1 constructs. These data suggest a
novel mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement: the collapsed replication fork resumes
accurately with the correct template, but later reverses the orientation of DNA replication
(U-turn) as it replicates through the palindrome centre. This leads to isodicentric
chromosome formation.
To characterise the effect of palindrome size in promoting restarted fork-dependent GCRs, a
series of constructs werte made where the palindrome size [P(bp)] varied between P(74) and
P(2400), but its centre of symmetry remained a constant distance from the site of fork restart
(Figure 2A). All constructs contained the 14bp interrupting sequence at the palindrome
centre. To establish GCR levels, genomic DNA was analysed by Southern blot using two
flanking probes, pB or pA.
For P(2400), probe pB revealed ~10% of the DNA corresponded to the rearranged product,
migrating at 14.4kb (Figure 2B). This is twice 7.2kb, the distance from the palindrome
centre to the centromere-proximal BglII site. Probe pA revealed a similar proportion of a
5.4kb fragment (twice 2.7kb, the distance between the palindrome centre and the telomere
proximal BglII site, Figure S4).

These rearranged products correspond, respectively, to dicentric and acentric
isochromosomes (data not shown). As expected, P(0), which has no IRs, showed no
detectable rearrangement products confirming that the 14.4kb and 5.4kb signals do not
represent replication intermediates or broken forks. All induced rearrangements were
dependent on replication fork arrest at RTS1 and the %GCR was dependent on palindrome
size (Figure 2B, C and S4B,D). P(314) was the smallest palindrome allowing GCR detection
by Southern analysis.
Palindromes are prone to form secondary structures including cruciforms (dsDNA) and
hairpins (ssDNA). Secondary structure formation is influenced by interrupting sequence (IS)
size16,17. To establish if GCR formation was related to IS size, we used P(1214) as a base
construct and varied the IS (Figure 2D). A 7bp IS showed slightly higher GCR levels than a
14bp IS. A 28bp IS reduced levels ~3 fold to 2%. This did not reduce further when the IS
was increased to 250bp (Figure 2E,F). These results indicate that a potential for structured
DNA formation promotes restarted fork U-turn but is not essential.
The data from Figure 1B,C suggested that the distance of the palindrome centre from the site
of restart influences the U-turn frequency. To clarify this, a further series was constructed
where different sizes of heterologous sequence separated a 1.2kb palindrome and RTS1
(Figure 3A). A maximum GCR amount was observed when the palindrome directly abutted
RTS1 (~8%). As the distance between the palindrome and RTS1 was increased to ~1.5kb,
the GCR level decreased ~4 fold to 2%. Further extension of the distance did not result in
further decreases (Figure 3B,C). These data suggest that the restarted fork is initially highly
error-prone, but matures as it travels the first few kb. However, the constant rate of GCR
observed in constructs separating the palindrome from RTS1 by >1.5kb implies that such
“matured” forks are not canonical and remain significantly error-prone.

While it has not been possible to establish if recombination-restarted forks become errorfree over greater distances due to the limitations of our system, it is notable that break
induced replication (BIR) forks analysed in S. cerevisiae18 remain prone to replication
slippage19 and template exchange with homologous chromosomes20 over 10’s and 100’s of
kb. BIR initiates from a DSB and occurs outside of S phase in G2 arrested cells. Our
recombination-restarted forks restart without a DSB intermediate during S phase. It is thus
unclear how closely the two systems equate and if similar replisome configurations underlie
restarted replication in both systems.
NAHR occurring during the restart event generates acentric and dicentric isochromosomes
containing the intervening sequence originally present between the inverted RTS1 repeats.
Conversely, the isochromosomes generated by recombination-restarted forks executing a Uturn at the palindrome centre contain either two cen-proximal or two tel-proximal sequences
(defined from the centre of the IR/palindrome). Thus, we can establish the relative
contribution of these two distinct mechanisms in generating isochromosomes from the
double RTS1 palindrome construct, Rpal1R.
Double RTS1 constructs (Figure 1A) potentially cause isochromosome formation by either
NAHR or by recombination-restarted fork U-turn. The derivatives with a single RTS1
sequence cannot undergo NAHR and only generate isochromosomes by recombinationrestarted fork U-turn. We used Southern blot to distinguish these products (Figure 4A). The
major mechanism for the rearrangement for inverted RTS1 constructs is recombinationrestarted fork U-turn, with a minor contribution from NAHR. Therefore, the original
palindromic RuiuR construct, which showed a much higher level of isochromosome
formation compared with the original RuraR construct12, does so because of an additional
defect associated with forks restarted by HR can be visualised.

The junction consists of two sister chromatids fused at the repeat centre, suggesting that the
recombination-restarted replisome performs a U-turn by exchanging template strands
between the repeats. This would be consistent with the nascent strand frequently dissociating
transiently from, and then re-annealing to, its template. Synthesis continuing on an incorrect
inverted template would result in a “closed Y” structure at the repeat centre. Intriguingly,
large interrupting sequences reduce, but do not eliminate, the rearrangement, suggesting
homology either with or without structured DNA can drive a U-turn.
The genome rearrangement profiles in cancer are complex, including simple CNVs,
chromothripsis (multiple linked rearrangements)21, translocations and gene amplifications
that often initiate from isochromosomes3. Similarly, rearrangements in genomic disorders
include simple recurrent CNV caused by NAHR during meiosis (or occasionally in mitotic
cells), inverted duplication deletions22, non-recurrent CNVs typified by microhomology (or
no homology) at the junction23, and complex multi-junction events which, in some cases,
suggest multiple contiguous replication errors4,24,25.
Our data show recombination-restarted forks are error-prone, with an unexpectedly high
propensity (up to 1:40 events) to U-turn between short IRs which can be separated by many
kilobases. Likewise, recombination-restarted forks cause increased microhomologydependent insertions and deletions26. Current models for the generation of replicationassociated rearrangements almost invariably assume a double strand break (DSB) as the
initiating event, which subsequently undergoes an incorrect choice of restart site based on
homology or microhomology. We propose that inaccurate replication from forks correctly
restarted without a DSB intermediate also makes a significant contribution to genome
rearrangement. Once a fork is restarted at the correct sequence it is particularly prone to Uturn between IRs. While our physical assay can detect these events at IRs of ~150bp, the
relationship between repeat size and frequency (Figure 2C) suggests shorter repeats will still
generate a significant rate.

While we cannot directly establish if recombination-restarted forks are responsible for
genome rearrangements in human cells, our data predicts that isochromosome formation in
cancer cells will be elevated at fragile sites, where replication forks are prone to collapse and
low origin density necessitates fork restart. Interestingly, isodicentric chromosome
formation and subsequent Breakage-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) cycle-dependent rearrangements
initiate gene amplification27 and fragile sites have been associated with amplification
boundaries as well as other cancer-related GCRs28. Similarly, slippage at microhomology by
recombination-restarted forks likely contributes to the frequent CNVs associated with
cancer19,26.
Equally, several classes of genomic disorders are compatible with a contribution from
recombination-restarted forks: one well characterised rearrangement involves a triplicated
segment embedded within a duplication29 mediated by small inverted low copy repeats.
DUP-TRP/INV-DUP involves two “breakpoint” junctions, one within the repeats and a
second showing microhomology. Such a rearrangement can be explained by two distinct
events associated with a single fork restart. Likewise, several other genomic disorders result
from inverted duplication deletions22, which are predicted to be the stabilised events of
breakage of an isodicentric chromosome during BFB cycles.
