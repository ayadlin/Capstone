ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Several key
genes and pathways have been proven to correlate with breast cancer pathology. This
study sought to explore the differences in key transcription factors (TFs), transcriptional
regulation networks and dysregulated pathways in different tissues in breast cancer.
We employed 14 breast cancer datasets from NCBI-GEO and performed an integrated
analysis in three different tissues including breast, blood and saliva. The results showed
that there were eight genes (CEBPD, EGR1, EGR2, EGR3, FOS, FOSB, ID1 and NFIL3)
down-regulated in breast tissue but up-regulated in blood tissue. Furthermore, we
identified several unreported tissue-specific TFs that may contribute to breast cancer,
including ATOH8, DMRT2, TBX15 and ZNF367. The dysregulation of these TFs damaged
lipid metabolism, development, cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and metastasis
processes. Among these pathways, the breast tissue showed the most serious impairment
and the blood tissue showed a relatively moderate damage, whereas the saliva tissue
was almost unaffected. This study could be helpful for future biomarker discovery, drug
design, and therapeutic and predictive applications in breast cancers.

annum between 1980 and 2010 [1]. Based on incidence
data from the Globocan 2008 database extrapolated to the
projected world population in 2030, the World Economic
Forum estimates that nearly 2.2 million new cases of
breast cancer will be diagnosed worldwide in 2030 [2].
Furthermore, despite the high treatment success rate, it

remains the number one cause of cancer death in women
[3]. Approximately 522,000 women worldwide died of
breast cancer in 2012, including 324,000 women in less
developed countries where the malignancy is currently
the leading cause of female cancer deaths, accounting for
14.3% of all cancer fatalities [4].
Several key transcription factors (TFs) play critical
roles in the proliferation, invasion and migration of breast
cancer cells [5, 6]. A recent study identified 8 TFs that are
critical for basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cell growth,
and SOX11 was the only TF required for BLBC growth
but not for the growth of non-BLBC cells [7]. PITX2,
a paired-like Homeobox transcription factor, contributes
to the invasiveness of breast cancer cells, which is an
activity that appears to be mediated by the Wnt/betaCatenin pathway [8]. In addition, another study identified
Tbx3 as a novel target of tumor suppressor miR-206
and characterized the miR-206/Tbx3 signaling pathway,
which is involved in the proliferation, invasion and
maintenance of the cancer stem cell population in breast
cancer cells [9].
A cross-tissue gene expression comparison in
disease will help us to understand the global molecular
landscape and reveal new candidate genes that may serve
as suitable drug targets. A recent study reconstructed gene
regulatory networks in coronary artery disease from seven
tissues (atherosclerotic arterial wall, internal mammary
artery, liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, subcutaneous fat
and whole blood) and identified key drivers including AIP,
DRAP1, POLR2I and PQBP1 [10]. Another study revealed
several early warning signal genes in liver, muscle and
adipose tissues in type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats based
on a dynamic network method [11]. Furthermore, a
recent clinical study showed that DNA methylation and
the gene expression of HIF3A were associated with BMI
and insulin resistance by cross-tissue validation (blood,
subcutaneous adipose and skeletal muscle) [12].
Several abnormal metabolic pathways, potential
biomarkers and drug target genes have already been
identified in breast cancer [13–15]. However, to our
knowledge, no study has conducted a cross-tissue
comparison via the integration of multiple sets of breast
cancer gene expression data. Therefore, in the present
study, we integrated 14 breast cancer gene expression
datasets containing breast, blood and saliva tissues in order
to explore the differences in the transcriptional regulation
relationships between TFs and TF-target genes as well as
impaired pathways in breast cancer and mine the diverse
gene signatures among these three tissues.

the three subgroups are shown in Table 2 . In the breast
group, we obtained 1,300 up-regulated and 1,201 downregulated genes. Furthermore, there were 64 up-regulated
and 15 down-regulated genes in the blood group. However,
we found no differential expression genes in the saliva
group. Commonly and tissue-specific dysregulated genes
in the breast and blood group are shown in Supplementary
Table 1. We obtained 16 commonly up-regulated genes
and 2 commonly down-regulated genes. In addition, 2
genes were up-regulated in the breast and down-regulated
in blood. However, 15 genes were down-regulated in
the breast but up-regulated in blood. Among these 35
genes, the effect of NCEH1, THOC4, UBE2M, EPB42 or
SNORD104 on breast cancer still has yet to be reported.

Tissue-specific dysregulated pathways in breast
cancer
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results
showed that there were 22 up-regulated and 25 downregulated pathways in the breast group, and 77 upregulated and 3 down-regulated pathways in the blood
group. Only 1 up-regulated pathway was enriched in
the saliva group. The Venn diagram of these enriched
pathways is shown in Figure 1. There were 17 commonly
up-regulated pathways and 3 commonly down-regulated
pathways between breast and blood. Table 3 shows
the top 10 significantly enriched pathways in the three
groups. The cell cycle, DNA replication, spliceosome,
proteasomes, mismatch repair, p53 signaling pathway,
nucleotide excision repair and other 10 pathways were
up-regulated in the breast and blood groups. Additionally,
the down-regulated pathways in the blood group were
all enriched in the breast group (olfactory transduction,
renin angiotensin system and neuroactive ligand receptor
interaction). However, three pathways (fatty acid
metabolism, adipocytokine signaling pathway and valine,
leucine and isoleucine degradation) were down-regulated
in the breast group but up-regulated in the blood group.

Expression profiles of TFs and TF-target genes
The expression profiles of 1,469 mapped TFs in
three tissues are shown in Figure 2. We obtained 145
and 13 differentially expressed TFs in breast and blood,
respectively (Supplementary Table 2). No dysregulated
TF was found in the saliva group. There were eight TFs
(CEBPD, EGR1, EGR2, EGR3, FOS, FOSB, ID1 and
NFIL3) that were down-regulated in the breast group
but up-regulated in the blood group. We used TRRUST
web server and mapped 11, 87, 5, 3, 55, 3, 1 and 10
target genes of these TFs to our datasets, respectively.
Next, we filtered the TFs that have more than 15 target
genes and showed their expression profiles. Figure 3
shows the expression profiles of EGR1 and its target
genes in the three groups. There were several target
genes that were activated by EGR1, such as FAP, FN1,

zinc finger proteins (ZNF528, ZNF479, DMRT2, ZNF583,
TBX15, ATOH8, ZNF367 and YBX2).

The tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory
networks (TRNs) of breast, blood and saliva are shown in
Supplementary Figure 3-5. The TRN properties of three
tissues were listed in Supplementary Table 3. We found
that breast TRN had the highest clustering coefficient
of 0.083; this value in blood TRN is 0.038 and 0.000
in saliva TRN. Furthermore, breast TRN showed the
highest connected component of 153, followed by blood
TRN (116) and saliva TRN (28). In addition, breast TRN
had the most multi-edge node pairs of 95, followed by
blood TRN (55) and saliva TRN (9). The betweenness
centrality of three TRNs were displayed in Supplementary
Figure 6. In breast TRN, we found several TFs had high
betweenness centralities, suggesting that this network
could be divided into multiple modules (Supplementary
Figure 3 and 6A). However, TFs in blood and saliva TRNs
had low betweenness centralities (Supplementary Figure
6B and 6C). We listed TFs ≥ 100 degrees in these TRNs
in Supplementary Table 4. There were 23 TFs in breast
TRN and 8 TFs in blood TRN; no TF ≥ 100 degrees were
found in saliva TRN. In breast TRN, we also found 5 TFs
≥ 200 degrees; these TFs were NR1H4, HNF4A, POU4F2,
PPARG and ZNF528. In addition, 8 TFs ≥ 100 degrees in
breast and blood TRNs still have no data; most of them are

Regulation type of TF-target genes in enriched
pathways
Numerous studies have demonstrated that
the PPAR signaling pathway and complement and
coagulation cascades are correlated with breast
cancer pathology [16–21]. Therefore, we showed the
regulation types and expression profiles of genes in
these two pathways in breast (Figure 5 and 6). We also
showed these pathways in the blood and saliva groups
(Supplementary Figure 7-10). In Figure 5, the results
showed that down-regulated PPARG suppresses many
downstream genes in the PPAR signaling pathway.
These genes were mainly involved in lipid metabolism,
adipocyte differentiation, gluconeogenesis and other
intracellular processes. In Figure 6, down-regulated F3
suppressed the expression of several downstream genes.
Furthermore, up-regulated PALU and PALUR activated
the cell adhesion, migration and proliferation functions.
However, in the blood group, some genes in these two
pathways showed opposite expression (Supplementary
Figure 7 and 9). These two pathways were almost
unaffected in the saliva group (Supplementary Figure
8 and 10).

DISCUSSION

serious stromal genome heterogeneity between breast and
prostate tumors and found that several metabolism- and
cellular process-related pathways were affected in breast
cancer, such as the tryptophan metabolism pathway and
ABC transporters pathway [23]. In this study, we found
17 common up-regulated pathways (e.g., cell cycle,
DNA replication, and p53 signaling pathway) both in
breast and blood tissue. However, the 3 pathways showed
contrary regulation between breast and blood. Only the
ribosome pathway was up-regulated in the saliva group
(Table 3). Furthermore, we performed GSEA using
curated canonical pathways gene sets (http://software.
broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb) to verify the above
results. Our results showed that most of the enriched
KEGG pathways are included in the enriched canonical
pathways in both breast and blood tissues, no enriched
canonical pathway in saliva (Supplementary Figure 11).
These findings suggested that it had diversity in the
impairment of pathways and biological functions in breast
cancer for different tissues.

The present study showed a huge discrepancy in
the global gene expression profiles, influenced pathways,
transcription factor signatures and their transcriptional
regulatory networks in breast, blood and saliva tissues
in breast cancer. Among these three tissues, the most
seriously impaired was the breast tissue. The blood tissue
showed a relatively moderate damage, whereas the saliva
tissue showed an almost undetectable difference.
Previous studies have identified numerous affected
pathways and biological functions in breast cancer. Clarke
et al. found a severe immune response dysfunction in
breast cancer by a weighted gene coexpression network
method [22]. A recent study identified several affected
pathways such as cell cycle, cell adhesion and DNA
replication in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and the
impairment pathways and dysregulated genes in IDC
were different between the low-genetic-grade and highgenetic-grade groups [15]. Our previous study revealed a

We identified 8 TFs with contrasting expression in
breast and blood tissues based on differentially expressed
gene analysis (CEBPD, EGR1, EGR2, EGR3, FOS,
FOSB, ID1 and NFIL3). We also performed GSEA using
transcription factor targets (TFT) gene set in three tissues.
The gene sets contain genes that share a transcription
factor binding site defined in the TRANSFAC (version
7.4, http://www.gene-regulation.com/) database. The
identified TFs in breast and blood tissues are shown in
Supplementary Table 5. However, we found only 17
dysregulated TFs in 90 TFT enriched TFs in breast

tissue, and 2 up-regulated TFs in 22 TFT enriched TFs in
blood tissue. FOSB is a member of the Fos gene family.
These Fos genes encode leucine zipper proteins that
can dimerize with proteins of the JUN family, thereby
forming the transcription factor complex AP-1. The
encoded FOS proteins have been shown to be involved
in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation
[24]. Early growth response proteins are a family of
zinc finger transcription factors. The following are the
four members of this family: EGR1, EGR2, EGR3 and
EGR4. All of these TFs have been proven to correlate

groups are displayed. The horizontal dashed lines indicate the cutoff values of log2(FC). The up- and down-regulated TFs are represented

with breast cancer pathogenesis and prognosis [25–28].
In addition, this study found the following tissue specific
TFs that were not reported in breast cancer: ATOH8,
DMRT2, TBX15 and ZNF367. Down-regulated ATOH8
has been proven to contribute to the malignant phenotype
of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [29] and increases the stem
cell features of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [30]. Tun
et al. reported that DMRT2 and other developmental TFs
were significantly down-regulated in clear cell renal cell
carcinoma [31]. Recently, genome-wide DNA methylation
analysis suggested that TBX15 was hyper-methylated and
down-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma datasets
[32]. However, contrary to these three TFs, ZNF367 was
over-expressed in adrenocortical carcinoma, malignant
pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma and thyroid cancer
[33]. Interestingly, the expression patterns of these four
TFs in our breast datasets were the same as those in
previous reports. No expression change of these TFs was
found in blood or saliva tissues.
The present study showed tissue-specific expressed
TFs and target genes caused different impairment of
biological functions in different tissues. We displayed
these transcriptional regulation relationships in the
PPAR signaling pathway and the complement and

coagulation cascades pathway. EGR1 is necessary and
sufficient to activate human peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-γ1 (PPARG) gene expression, which
has been verified in human aortic smooth muscle cells
[34]. PPARG is a key regulator of lipogenic genes,
and a previous mouse study demonstrated that PPARG
plays a crucial role in hepatic lipid metabolism [35].
The present study showed that low-expressed EGR1
suppressed PPARG, and then low-expressed PPARG
suppressed a series of downstream genes associated
with lipogenesis, cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid
transport and oxidation functions, thus resulting in
abnormal lipid metabolism in breast tissue (Figure
3 and 5). Coagulation factor III, also known as tissue
factor (F3, also known as TF), has been reported to be
regulated by EGR1, is responsible for the initiation of
the coagulation protease cascades by specific limited
proteolysis [36, 37]. In breast tissue, down-regulated
EGR1 suppressed F3 expression, caused the lowexpression of several downstream genes and activated
PLAU and PLAUR, eventually disturbing cell adhesion,
proliferation and metastasis functions (Figure 5 and 6).
Furthermore, low-expressed FOS suppressed CLU and
inhibited cell lysis function in breast tissue. However,

green colors represent the log2(FC) of the corresponding genes.

EGR1 and FOS were all up-regulated in blood tissue,
and some downstream genes showed high-expression.
No expression change was observed in saliva tissue
(Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 7 and 8). It is worth
noting that these functions were correlated with breast
cancer pathological processes, and the extent of damage
in these pathways varied largely in different tissues. Our
study also found a series of unreported tissue-specific
TFs that may correlate with breast cancer. However, no
TF-target data were provided. Therefore, future studies
need to verify these correlations.
In conclusion, our study identified a series of tissuespecific TFs that correlated with breast cancer. Some
of them are novel, such as ATOH8, DMRT2, TBX15
and ZNF367. These TFs may be used as biomarkers
for accurate diagnosis and prognosis or as predictive
markers for treatment efficiency. Furthermore, we found
these dysregulated TFs and their target genes impaired
lipid metabolism, the coagulation cascade, cell adhesion,
proliferation, differentiation and metastasis processes.
The extent of damage in these functions varied widely in
breast, blood and saliva tissues. These results suggest that
the tissue-specific gene expression in breast cancer would
require careful consideration in future clinical practice and
theoretical research.

and 10 controls). Thus, we divided these datasets into
3 subgroups based on the sample collection source
including breast, blood and saliva.
R v3.2.2 was used to perform data preprocessing.
We used the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm
in oligo package [38] to normalize the raw expression
data and generate normalized gene expression intensity.
Gene annotation, integration and renormalization of
the 14 datasets were carried out using a custom written
Python code. We have removed probes with no gene
annotation or that matched multiple gene symbols. Next,
we calculated the average expression value of multiple
probe IDs that matched to an official gene symbol and
took this value to represent the expression intensity of
the corresponding gene symbol. The renormalization
method and scripts are described in our previous
publications [39, 40]. The distributions of RMA
processed and global renormalized gene expression
values across all studies are shown in Supplementary
Figure 1 and 2. After the global expression was
renormalized, the distribution of gene expression values
across all studies had a consistent range.

Differential expression genes analysis
Differential expression gene analysis was performed
using R v3.2.2 and the Bioconductor Library. The
empirical Bayes algorithm (function “eBayes”) in the
limma package [41] was used to detect differentially
expressed genes between breast cancer patients and
controls. Significantly up-regulated genes were defined
by as a logarithmic transformed fold-change (log2(FC))
≥ log2(1.5) and a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P
value ≤ 0.05. Significantly down-regulated genes were
defined by a log2(FC) ≤ -log2(1.5) and an FDR-P value
≤ 0.05. We carried out the differential expression analysis
in three tissues.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microarray data collection and preprocessing
Human breast cancer microarray datasets were
searched and downloaded from the NCBI-GEO
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) in March
2016. We used the keywords of “breast cancer”, “breast
adenocarcinoma” and “breast tumor” to perform accurate
searching. The data selection criteria were as follows:
(1) all datasets were genome-wide; (2) the samples of
each data set must include breast cancer patients and
controls; (3) the number of cases and controls in each
dataset must be ≥ 3; (4) all samples were non-cell-line
samples; and (5) complete microarray raw or normalized
data were available. Based on the above criteria, we
have finally chosen 14 datasets for our integrated
analysis (GSE8977, GSE10810, GSE16391, GSE20266,
GSE26910, GSE27562, GSE29431, GSE31192,
GSE35925, GSE36765, GSE42568, GSE45827,
GSE50567, and GSE61304). The integrated datasets
included 621 breast cancer patients and 208 controls.
Details of all datasets could be seen in Table 1 . All the
datasets were tested using the platform of Affymetrix
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Among them,
11 datasets were tested using breast tissue (including
470 patients and 163 controls), 2 datasets were tested
using blood (including 141 patients 35 controls) and 1
dataset was tested using saliva (including 10 patients

Gene set enrichment analysis
We used javaGSEA Desktop Application v2.2.2
to perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of
breast cancer datasets. We chose KEGG pathway
enrichment analysis to compare the impaired pathways
in breast, blood and saliva tissues and tried to find the
correlations between TFs and impaired pathways. The
curated KEGG gene sets v5.1 (including 186 gene sets)
(http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/genesets.
jsp?collection=CP:KEGG) were chosen to perform KEGG
pathway enrichment analysis among the three groups.
Additionally, the gene sets less than 15 genes or more
than 500 genes were excluded. The phenotype label was
set as breast cancer vs. control. The t-statistic mean of
the genes was computed in each KEGG pathway using a
permutation test with 1000 replications. The up-regulated
pathways were defined by a normalized enrichment score

(NES) > 0 and the down-regulated pathways were defined
by an NES < 0. Pathways with an FDR-P value ≤ 0.05
were chosen as significantly enriched. We used Venn
diagram in InteractiVenn (http://www.interactivenn.net/)
[42] to show the enriched KEGG pathways among these
groups.

Transcription factor analysis
We downloaded 1,544 human transcription factors
(TFs) from the Animal Transcription Factor Database
(AnimalTFDB, http://www.bioguo.org/AnimalTFDB/
index.php) [43] and mapped 1,469 TFs to our integrated
datasets. We filtered TFs that were differentially expressed
in two and more groups and used the TRRUST web server
(http://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/) [44] to find the target
genes of the commonly dysregulated TFs. TRRUST could
provide the information of the regulation type (such as
activation and repression) between the queried TFs and
target genes. We used heatmap in the “pheatmap” package
to show the expression profiles of TFs and TF-target genes
in the three groups.
Reconstruction of tissue-specific transcriptional
regulatory networks (including breast, blood and saliva)
were used GENIE3 software [45]. We used the gene
expression matrix of the three tissues and transcriptional
regulation relationship list in TRRUST as the input
data and ran GENIE3 with its default parameters. The
original output contained 4.12E8 TF-target interactions
and we extracted the top 10,000 interactions. Next, we
used Cytoscape v3.2.1 to visualize the output results. We
used the NetworkAnalyzer tool in Cytoscape to perform
network analysis of the three networks.
Based on previous reports, the PPAR signaling
pathway and complement and coagulation cascades
were critical in breast cancer pathology [16–21].
Therefore, we chose these two pathways and showed the
expression profiles of the corresponding genes. We used
the “pathview” package [46] to display these results.
This package could provide the links between genes and
pathways based on the KEGG pathway. We showed the
gene expression profiles, their interactions and regulations,
and related functions in the selected pathways in each
group (breast, blood and saliva).
