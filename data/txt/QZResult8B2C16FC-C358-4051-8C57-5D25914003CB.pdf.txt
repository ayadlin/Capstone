Abstract

Introduction

Vascular disrupting agents (VDA) cause acute shutdown of
abnormal established tumor vasculature, followed by massive
intratumoral hypoxia and necrosis. However, a viable rim of
tumor tissue invariably remains from which tumor regrowth
rapidly resumes. We have recently shown that an acute systemic mobilization and homing of bone marrow–derived circulating endothelial precursor (CEP) cells could promote tumor
regrowth following treatment with either a VDA or certain
chemotherapy drugs. The molecular mediators of this systemic
reactive host process are unknown. Here, we show that following treatment of mice with OXi-4503, a second-generation potent prodrug derivative of combretastatin-A4 phosphate, rapid
increases in circulating plasma vascular endothelial growth
factor, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) levels are detected. With the aim of
determining whether G-CSF is involved in VDA-induced CEP
mobilization, mutant G-CSF-R / mice were treated with OXi4503. We found that as opposed to wild-type controls, G-CSFR / mice failed to mobilize CEPs or show induction of SDF-1
plasma levels. Furthermore, Lewis lung carcinomas grown in
such mice treated with OXi-4503 showed greater levels of
necrosis compared with tumors treated in wild-type mice. Evidence for rapid elevations in circulating plasma G-CSF, vascular endothelial growth factor, and SDF-1 were also observed
in patients with VDA (combretastatin-A4 phosphate)-treated
cancer. These results highlight the possible effect of druginduced G-CSF on tumor regrowth following certain cytotoxic
drug therapies, in this case using a VDA, and hence G-CSF as
a possible therapeutic target. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7524–8]

The growth of new blood vessel capillaries in tumors—
therapeutic inhibition of which is now a clinically validated
strategy—seems to be mediated not only by the local division of
pre-existing differentiated vascular endothelial cells (‘‘sprouting
angiogenesis’’; ref. 1) but also by a systemic process involving the
mobilization and homing of a variety of bone marrow–derived
cell (BMDC) populations (2). These include circulating endothelial precursor cells (CEP), which can incorporate into the lumens
of growing blood vessels and differentiate into endothelial cells
(2, 3).
We recently reported that exposure of tumor-bearing mice to
cytotoxic-like vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) can cause a
rapid (i.e., within hours) mobilization of BMDCs, some of which
are CEPs, followed by their homing to the viable rim of tumor
tissue (4), which characteristically remains after treatment with
VDAs, and surrounds a sometimes massive necrotic tumor center
(4, 5). This acute reactive host response contributes to the rapid
regrowth of the drug-treated tumors and thus compromises
the durability of the initial antitumor effect induced by VDA
treatment. Furthermore, we recently reported that certain
cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs (administered at maximum tolerated doses) such as taxanes or 5-fluorouracil, can also cause
acute mobilization of CEPs (6). In both cases, combination
treatment with an antiangiogenic drug, e.g., DC101, a VEGFR-2
neutralizing antibody (4, 6, 7), blocks CEP mobilization and thus
enhances the antitumor activity of the cytotoxic therapy used
(4, 6). Given the remarkably acute and robust nature of the
BMDC response induced by VDAs, and its consequences for
tumor response and effects on therapeutic benefit, we decided
to investigate the possible molecular mediators of this therapyinduced mobilization of proangiogenic BMDCs, including
CEPs. To do so, we used a potent VDA, i.e., the microtubuleinhibiting agent, OXi-4503, a second-generation prodrug derivative
of the VDA combretastatin-A4 phosphate (CA4P; ref. 5).

received 45, 54, or 63 mg/m2 of CA4P i.v. in the first treatment cycle
without bevacizumab. For the purpose of this study, blood was collected
at baseline (pretreatment), and 4 h after CA4P treatment. The protocol
was approved by the ethics committee.
Tumor and animal models. All animal studies were conducted
in accordance with the animal care guidelines at Sunnybrook
Health Sciences Centre (Toronto, Canada), and at Washington University
(St. Louis, MO), and described in detail in the Supplementary Online
Material.
Evaluation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells by flow
cytometry. Blood was obtained from anaesthetized mice by retro-orbital
sinus bleeding. Viable CEPs were quantitated using flow cytometry, as
described previously (3), and in the Supplementary Online Material.
Tissue processing and imaging. Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry were performed as described previously (4, 9), and in the
Supplementary Online Material.
Evaluation of circulating granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,
vascular endothelial growth factor, and stromal derived factor-1
plasma levels by ELISAs. Tumor-free or 500 mm3 MeWo human
melanoma–bearing nude mice, as well as tumor-free granulocyte colonystimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R / ) and wild-type control mice were
treated with an i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg of OXi-4503, or PBS as a control.
Four hours later, mice were sacrificed and blood was drawn by cardiac
puncture. In patients, blood samples were obtained by intravenous puncture.
Plasma was separated using heparin and subsequently stored at 70jC until
assayed. Levels of mouse or human vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and G-CSF were assessed by using
commercially available sandwich ELISAs (R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean F SD and the statistical
significance of differences in mean values was assessed by two-tailed
Student’s t test. Differences between means of experimental/treated groups
compared with control-untreated or baseline (pretreatment) groups (unless

indicated otherwise) were considered significant at values of P < 0.01 (**) or
0.05 < P < 0.01 (*).

Results
Rapidly elevated plasma levels of predominantly hostderived G-CSF, VEGF, and SDF-1 are induced by OXi-4503.
To investigate whether induction of certain growth factors may
be involved in the acute mobilization of CEPs by VDA treatment,
we analyzed plasma from non-tumor–bearing or 500 mm3 MeWo
human melanoma–bearing nude mice obtained 4 hours after
treatment with OXi-4503 for human and mouse G-CSF, VEGF, and
SDF-1 using specific ELISAs. Emphasis was placed on these
particular factors because all are known to induce CEP mobilization (10–12). The results in Fig. 1A to C show acute increases in
both normal and tumor-bearing mice of mouse G-CSF, VEGF, and
SDF-1 (10- to 20-fold, 4- to 5-fold, and 2-fold increases,
respectively). Interestingly, levels of human G-CSF were significantly lower 4 hours after OXi-4503 treatment. Human VEGF levels
were not detectable in untreated tumor-bearing mice, but a
relatively small amount (15–18.32 pg/mL) was detected in two out
of five mice, 4 hours after OXi-4503 treatment. Of note, we recently
reported marked elevations of plasma SDF-1 in non–tumor-bearing
mice treated with maximum tolerated dose paclitaxel, which
contributed to the rapid CEP spike observed similar in nature to
the VDA-induced effect (6). Overall, these results suggest that
several factors known to mediate the mobilization of CEPs are
acutely increased by OXi-4503 treatment and are, in the main,
derived from the host.

Elevated G-CSF contributes to the rapid CEP mobilization
induced by VDA treatment. G-CSF is well known as a
mobilizing factor for hematopoietic stem cells, as well as CEPs
(12, 13). Given the pronounced elevation of G-CSF induced by
OXi-4503, we asked whether it has a direct effect on CEP
mobilization following VDA treatment. To do so, tumor-free
BALB/c mice were infused with 5 Ag/kg of human recombinant
G-CSF, and blood was drawn 4 and 24 hours later for the evaluation
of CEPs. The results in Supplementary Fig. S1 show that G-CSF
induced a 3-fold to 4-fold spike in CEPs levels, similar to what
we observed using OXi-4503. Similar results were obtained
using C57Bl/6 mice (data not shown). Next, we evaluated the
levels of CEPs and relative tumor response as measured by
necrosis in mutant G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R / ) mice (14) after
OXi-4503 treatment. Figure 2A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S2 show that levels of CEPs in G-CSF-R / mice do not
significantly change within the first 24 hours, in contrast to
their wild-type controls. In addition, transplanted LLC tumors
grown in G-CSFR / mice or wild-type control mice were
allowed to grow until the tumors reached 500 mm3, at which
point, the mice were treated with OXi-4503. Three days later,
tumors were removed and evaluated for tumor response
by measuring necrosis. The results in Fig. 2C and D show
that whereas tumors grown in wild-type mice, which exhibited
a prominent necrotic center exceeding f15% of the total tumor

area, tumors treated in G-CSF-R / mice had a significantly greater
degree of tumor necrosis (f35%). These results suggest a direct
effect of G-CSF on promoting CEP mobilization, which contributes,
at least in part, to the rapid regrowth of tumors from the viable
tumor rim, after VDA treatment.
To further assess the contribution of G-CSF to CEP mobilization, plasma levels of SDF-1, VEGF, and G-CSF were evaluated in
G-CSF-R / mice, 4 hours after they were treated with OXi-4503.
The results in Fig. 3 show that both VEGF and G-CSF plasma
levels were substantially elevated, although the baseline levels of
G-CSF in G-CSF-R / mice were remarkably higher in comparison
to their levels in wild-type control mice. Interestingly, SDF-1 levels
were down-regulated in G-CSF-R / mice, which suggests that
SDF-1 may also be secondarily involved in G-CSF–induced CEP
mobilization following OXi-4503 treatment.
Increases in circulating G-CSF, VEGF, and SDF-1 plasma
levels in cancers treated with a VDA. To evaluate whether some
of our preclinical results could be reproduced in the clinical setting,
blood was collected from patients with advanced solid tumors
enrolled in a phase I clinical study (8) at baseline (pretreatment)
and 4 hours after treatment with CA4P. Plasma was separated for
the evaluation of G-CSF, VEGF, and SDF-1 levels using specific
ELISAs. The results in Fig. 4 show that the levels of all three
cytokines were substantially increased within 4 hours of CA4P
treatment, similar to the results we observed in mice using

consistent with the respective preclinical findings.

Discussion
Cytotoxic anticancer drugs, or treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation, and VDAs can often cause major tumor responses
manifested by tumor cell death subsequently leading to various
degrees of tumor shrinkage. However, the benefit of such
responses, at least in terms of increased survival times, is often
limited because of rapid tumor repopulation (15). Consequently,
developing and optimizing strategies to slow down such rapid
tumor repopulation are of considerable therapeutic interest (15).
Some possible strategies include closer spacing of cytotoxic
therapies such as ‘‘dose-dense’’ chemotherapy, or hyperfractioned
radiation (15), or the combined use of biological therapies that
target cell proliferative mechanisms, including antiangiogenic
drugs, during the treatment-free intervals in between successive
cycles of cytotoxic therapy (4, 6, 15–17).
Tumor cell repopulation/regrowth has generally been viewed as
an intrinsic tumor cell-driven property (15). However, our
previous studies implicated that a number of cytotoxic drugs
can rapidly activate various host processes which can contribute
significantly to tumor repopulation, one of which involves acute

mobilization and tumor homing of proangiogenic BMDCs,
including CEPs (4, 6). In our recent study, we reported that
SDF-1 is one of the molecular mediators of CEP mobilization
following paclitaxel treatment, as neutralizing anti–SDF-1 antibodies that were administered in combination with chemotherapy
resulted in the failure of induction of CEP spikes (6). Here, using a
VDA as the cytotoxic-(like) agent, we have implicated another
molecular mediator responsible for CEP mobilization. The
increase in circulating G-CSF was remarkable, being in the
range of one order of magnitude, and moreover, it occurred
within 4 hours of VDA treatment. However, G-CSF-R / mice
failed to induce elevated levels of both CEPs and SDF-1. Eash and
colleagues reported that G-CSF mobilizes neutrophils within
hours, probably by directly down-regulating CXCR4 expression
(18). Moreover, AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, was also found to
mobilize CEPs and other hematopoietic stem cells within 4 hours
(19). Whether G-CSF acts in a similar fashion to AMD-3100
by down-regulating CXCR4 expression on CEPs remains to be
determined in future studies. In addition, we also observed a
significant and rapid reduction in levels of WBC counts, following
treatment with OXi-4503, in G-CSF-R / mice but not in wildtype controls, which is consistent with recent findings by Petit
and colleagues (20), implicating the direct effect of VDAs on
hematopoietic cells. However, how G-CSF acts to maintain normal

baseline and 4 h after CA4P treatment was evaluated for G-CSF (n = 12), VEGF (n = 12), and SDF-1 (n = 6) plasma levels. The results obtained were plotted as fold
increase from the baseline level of each patient.

WBC counts in wild-type mice following VDA treatment remains
unknown.
Also noteworthy with respect to our results was the observation
of rapid elevation of G-CSF, VEGF, and SDF-1 plasma levels
observed in the peripheral blood of cancer patients treated with
CA4P, results which are obviously similar in some respects to the
rapid elevations of the three cytokines in our preclinical study.
Although we did not evaluate the levels of CEPs in clinical samples,
recent studies have shown that cancer patients treated with either
maximum tolerated dose paclitaxel-based chemotherapy or a VDA
(known as AVE8062) combined with cisplatinum, exhibited a rapid
elevation in CEP levels (6, 21).
One implication of our results relates to the outcome of cytotoxic dose-dense chemotherapy regimens which are made possible
by the use of recombinant G-CSF growth factor support to accelerate host recovery from myelosuppression. Although there is
no clinical evidence at present to suggest that administration of
recombinant G-CSF worsens clinical outcomes, it is conceivable
that the antitumor benefits obtained by using such dose-dense
(and hence more intensive) chemotherapy regimens are less than
would otherwise be the case. Moreover, regarding the possibility
of G-CSF–induced mobilization of BMDCs possibly facilitating
tumor angiogenesis, we also note the recent findings by Shojaei
and colleagues who reported that mobilization of proangiogenic
Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid suppressor cells can be induced indirectly
by G-CSF through up-regulation of Bv8/prokineticin (22).
In summary, our results suggest a host-reactive molecular
mechanism contributing to rapid tumor regrowth following

cytotoxic anticancer drug therapy using VDAs, and suggest that
G-CSF could conceivably be exploited transiently as a therapeutic
target under selected circumstances, e.g., as a means of enhancing
the efficacy of VDA therapy. Such targeting may be particularly
suitable in situations in which the cytotoxic drug treatment is not
associated with myelosuppression. In this regard, VDAs are not
associated with high-grade myelosuppression (5, 8, 21).
