ABSTRACT
TGF-β-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) is a critical mediator in inflammation,
immune response and cancer development. Our previous study demonstrated that
activation of TAK1 increases the expression of chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 7
(CCR7) and promotes lymphatic invasion ability of breast cancer cells. However, the
expression and association of activated TAK1 and CCR7 in breast tumor tissues is
unknown and the therapeutic effect by targeting TAK1 is also unclear. We showed
that activated TAK1 (as indicated by phospho-TAK1) and its binding protein TAB1
are strongly expressed in breast tumor tissues (77% and 74% respectively). In
addition, increase of phospho-TAK1 or TAB1 is strongly associated with overexpression of CCR7. TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol (5Z-O) inhibited TAK1 activity,
suppressed downstream signaling pathways including p38, IκB kinase (IKK) and
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and reduced CCR7 expression in metastatic MDAMB-231 cells. In addition, 5Z-O repressed NF-κB- and c-JUN-mediated transcription
of CCR7 gene. Knockdown of TAB1 attenuated CCR7 expression and tumor growth in
an orthotopic animal study. More importantly, lymphatic invasion and lung metastasis
were suppressed. Collectively, our results demonstrate that constitutive activation
of TAK1 is frequently found in human breast cancer and this kinase is a potential
therapeutic target for this cancer.

shown to involve in the regulation of innate immunity,
kidney fibrosis, cardiac remodeling and tumor pathogenesis
[6–11].
In cells, TAK1 forms a multiple protein complex
and is bound with its binding partners TAB1, TAB2 and
TAB3 [12]. Knockout of TAK1, TAB1 or TAB2 in mice
all leads to embryonic lethality indicating its activity
is critical for development [13, 14]. TAK1 activity is
mainly controlled by post-translation modifications.
Phosphorylation of the activation loop of TAK1 induced

INTRODUCTION
TGF-β-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) was
originally identified as a protein kinase which activity is
stimulated by TGF-β and bone morphogenetic proteins
in a complementation screen [1]. Subsequent studies
demonstrated that TAK1 is a key mediator in inflammation
and can be activated by many pro-inflammatory cytokines
like interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α and Tolllike receptor ligands [2–5]. In addition, TAK1 has been

upon cytokine stimulation increases TAK1 activity
[15, 16]. Ubiquitination of TAB2, TAB3 and TAK1
also regulates the activation of TAK1 [17, 18]. Wang et
al demonstrated that TAK1 is an ubiquitin-dependent
kinase and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
factor 6 (TRAF6), together with Ubc13, catalyzes the
formation of a Lys63-lined polyubiquitin chain of TAK1
[19]. Recently, another TRAF family member TRAF4 has
also been shown to trigger polyubiquitination of TAK1
and this modification is important for TAK1 activation
[20]. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that
TAB1 is modified with N-acetylglucosamine (so called
O-GlcNAcylation) and this modification is required for
full TAK1 activation [21].
TGF-β signaling plays an important role in the
initiation, promotion and progression of many types of
human cancer [22]. Because TAK1 is a key mediator of
TGF-β signaling, it is expected that TAK1 may have a
role in tumorigenesis. The involvement of TAK1 in breast
cancer was firstly demonstrated by two groups. Safina
et al identified TAK1 as an upstream activator of matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and is required for TGF-βinduced breast cancer metastasis [11]. Neil et al found a
novel TAB1:TAK1:IκB kinase:NF-κB signaling axis that
mediated the oncogenic activity of TGF-β in breast cancer
[23]. In addition to metastasis promotion, TAK1 signaling
increases resistance of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel and
topoisomerase inhibitors [24, 25].
We previously found that TAK1 is constitutively
activated in highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells while its activity is very low in non-metastatic MCF7 cells [26]. We also demonstrated that activation of TAK1
up-regulates the expression of chemokine (C-C motif)
receptor 7 (CCR7) and increases the lymphatic invasion
ability of breast cancer cells because lymphatic endothelial
cells (LECs) express high level of CCR7 ligands CCL19
and CCL21 and induce a chemotactic effect on CCR7expressing cancer cells. Collectively, our results suggest
CCR7 as a critical target of TAK1 in the mediation of
breast cancer metastasis. In this study, we extend our work
to investigate the expression and association of TAK1 and
CCR7 in breast tumor tissues. In addition, we tried to
inhibit TAK1 by chemical inhibitors and siRNA to validate
whether TAK1 is a therapeutic target of breast cancer.

an antibody which detected the phosphorylated Thr-178
and Thr-184 at the kinase activation loop of TAK1. As
shown in Figures 1A and 1B, activated TAK1 was stained
in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and was highly expressed
in 77% (54/70) of the tumor tissues. Expression of CCR7
was appeared at the plasma membrane and was detected
in 47% (33/70) of the cases. We found a strong association
between activated TAK1 and CCR7 (p = 0.002) confirming
our previous cell-based results. We also examined the
expression of the TAK1 binding partner TAB1 and found
the up-regulation of TAB1 in 74% of the tumor tissues. In
addition, expression of TAB1 is significantly associated
with CCR7 (p = 0.003).

Inhibition of TAK1 reduces CCR7 expression
We next addressed whether TAK1 is an upstream
regulator of CCR7. Our data showed that TAK1 activity
is high in MDA-MB-231 cells while it is low in MCF-7
cells (Figure 2A). However, the protein level of TAK1 was
similar in both cell lines indicating the increase of kinase
activity was caused by upstream signaling stimulation.
In consistent with our previous data, CCR7 is highly
expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells and is low in MCF-7
cells (Figure 2B). Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with a
selective TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-O dose-dependently inhibited
TAK1 activity without affecting the expression of TAK1
protein (Figure 2C). In agreement with our hypothesis,
5Z-O reduced CCR7 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner.
Flow cytometric analysis also demonstrated the reduction
of CCR7 protein on cell surface by 5Z-O (Figure 2D).
These effects were not due to the growth-inhibitory or
cytotoxic activity of 5Z-O because the proliferation of
MDA-MB-231 cells was only marginally reduced by 10–
15% at the highest concentration (1000 nM) used in these
experiments.

TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-O suppresses downstream
signaling and CCR7 promoter activity
The effect of 5Z-O on the activation of TAK1
downstream signaling was investigated. As shown in
Figure 3A, the enzymatic activity of p38, JNK and IKK
determined by detecting the phosphorylation status
of these kinases was dose-dependently inhibited by
5Z-O. To ascertain whether TAK1 increases CCR7 via
transcriptional activation, we cloned the promoter region
of human CCR7 gene and created the P1 promoterluciferase construct (–500/+64) (Figure 3B). Two
additional deletion constructs P2 (–223/+64) and P3
(–69/+64) were generated from P1 plasmid. Our data
demonstrated that 5Z-O inhibited the P1 promoter activity
dose-dependently (Figure 3C). Although 5Z-O also
inhibited the P2 and P3 promoter activity, we thought
the major responsive elements by which TAK1 regulates

TAK1 increases CCR7 expression in breast cancer cells

binding is significantly inhibited by 5Z-O (Figure 4A).
Ectopic expression of c-JUN dramatically induced c-JUN
activation (as demonstrated by increase of p-c-JUN) and
rescued the down-regulation of CCR7 by 5Z-O (Figure
4B). In addition, overexpression of IKK-β enhanced NFκB activation (as demonstrated by phosphorylation of
Ser276 which increases interaction with the transcriptional
coactivator p300/CBP to enhance NF-κB transcriptional
activity) also effectively counteracted 5Z-O-induced
inhibition (Figure 4C).

NF-κB and c-JUN are important for TAK1increased CCR7 expression
We next addressed the potential transcription
factors involved in the regulation of CCR7 by TAK1.
Two lines of evidence led us to investigate NF-κB and
AP-1. First, a previous study demonstrated that these two
transcription factors are important for in the regulation of
CCR7 expression in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
of head and neck [27]. Second, our current data showed
that TAK1 activated IKK and JNK, two upstream kinases
which play critical roles in the activation of NF-κB and
AP-1. ChIP assays indicated that NF-κB and c-JUN are
constitutively bound to human CCR7 promoter and their

Knockdown of TAB1 reduces tumor growth,
lymph node invasion and lung metastasis
To clarify the role of TAK1 in breast cancer in vivo,
we established TAK1 and TAB1 knockdown stable clones
by using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) methodology. As
shown in Figure 5A, the abundance of TAK1 is high in
MDA-MB-231 cells and was only marginally reduced

by shRNA. In the clone, expression of CCR7 was not
significantly affected (Figure 5B) indicating targeting of
TAK1 may not be a good strategy. Conversely, knockdown
of TAB1 in MDA-MB-231 cells effectively reduced
TAB1 protein (Figure 5C). In addition, the mRNA and
protein level of CCR7 were significantly reduced in the
clone (Figure 5D). We next tested the CCL19-induced
chemotaxis on control and TAB1-inhibited clone. As
shown in Figure 5E, CCL19 increased the chemotaxis of
MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner with the
maximal effect found at 200 ng/ml. Knockdown of TAB1
attenuated both basal and CCL19-induced chemotaxis
(Figure 5F). Therefore, we used the TAB1-inhibited
clone to do animal experiment. Indeed, tumor growth was
reduced in TAB1-inhibited clone (Figure 6A). Analysis of
TAB1 expression in tumor tissues confirmed that TAB1
protein was reduced by 70% in the knockdown clone when
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

compared to that of control vector-transduced clone (Figure
6B). More importantly, CCR7 expression was significantly
repressed in TAB1-inhibited clone suggesting the TAB1/
TAK1 signaling controls CCR7 in vivo (Figure 6C).
We next investigated whether inhibition of
the TAB1/TAK1 signaling (which reduced CCR7
expression) affects tumor metastasis. Invasion of MDAMB-231 cells into mouse axillary lymph nodes was
examined by detecting the expression of human Alu
sequence. Lymph nodes of the control group exhibited
high level of Alu sequence while it was reduced by 60%
in TAB1-inhibited group (Figure 7A). Similar results
were also observed in distal lymph nodes that isolated
from the counter side of tumor injection site (Figure 7B).
In addition, metastatic nodules were found in the lungs
of the control group while they were not detectable in
TAB1-inhibited group (Figure 7C).

DISCUSSION

and reduction of lymph node invasion and distant lung
metastasis. We also elucidate the mechanism by which
TAK1 controls CCR7 expression and find that TAK1
activates IKK and JNK kinases to increase the binding
of NF-κB and c-JUN to CCR7 promoter to stimulate its
transcription. These results support an oncogenic role of
TAK1 in human breast cancer.
We also found that knockdown of TAB1 reduces
migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells (data
not shown). In consistent with previous study, our
data showed the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9
is inhibited in TAB1-inhibited cells (Supplementary
Figures 1A and 1B). Interestingly, we found that the
cell-cell junction protein E-cadherin is re-expressed
after knockdown of TAB1. E-cadherin is a master
epithelial cell marker and is a key regulator of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) which expression is

Although TAK1 is known to involve in
tumorigenesis via induction of a number of downstream
target genes, the activation status (enzymatic activity) of
TAK1 in primary tumor tissues and its association with
target gene expression have little been investigated. In
this study, we demonstrate for the first time that TAK1
is highly activated in human breast tumor tissues by
detecting the phospho-TAK1 level. In addition, we
provide clear evidence that expression of activated TAK1
is strongly associated with the up-regulation of CCR7 in
tumor tissues confirming our previous results that TAK1
activation increases CCR7 expression in cultured breast
cancer cells. Moreover, we extend our study to show
that inhibition of TAK1 by knockdown of its binding
protein TAB1 leads to attenuation of CCR7 expression

tightly controlled by several transcription repressors.
Our data demonstrated that expression of Zeb1 and
Zeb2 but not Twist and Slug are repressed by TAB1
inhibition indicating Zeb1 and Zeb2 may be involved in
the suppression of E-cadherin by TAK1. Because TAK1
was originally identified as a kinase activated by TGF-β,
an important EMT promoter in diverse cancer types, it
is not surprising that inhibition of TAK1 activity could
reverse the EMT phenotype and re-activate E-cadherin
expression. Recently, Lam et al demonstrated Zeb1
and Snail are altered in TAK1-deficient metastatic skin
cancer cells [28]. How TAK1 modulates the expression
of transcription repressors to control E-cadherin
expression and EMT is still unknown. In addition, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effect of TAK1 on the transcription repressors may be
cell-type dependent because we did not see the alteration
of Snail and Slug in our TAB1-inhibited breast cancer
cells. Therefore, the regulation of EMT by TAK1 is
complex and needs to be elucidated in specific cancer
types. Taken together, we suggest a signaling network
activated by TAK1 to promote invasion and metastasis
in breast cancer (Supplementary Figure 2).
In addition to promotion of metastasis, TAK1 plays
a critical role in therapeutic resistance. This is largely
due to the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 by TAK1
which suppresses proapototic signaling pathways and
reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy
or radiotherapy. In pancreatic cancer, inhibition of TAK1

by RNAi knockdown or an oral inhibitor LYTAK1
significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of oxaliplatin
and gemcitabine [29]. In nude mice, administration of
LYTAK1 and gemcitabine reduced tumor burden and
prolonged animal survival. In neuroblastoma, 5Z-O,
the TAK1 inhibitor used in this study, augmented the
cell-killing activity of doxorubicin and etoposide [30].
Recently, Zhao et al showed that a tumor suppressor
miRNA miR-26b inhibits cancer growth by targeting
TAK1 and TAB3 [31]. Ectopic expression of this
miRNA enhances the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells to TNF-α and doxorubicin. Beside
chemoresistance, TAK1 also increases radioresistance.
Han et al demonstrated that radiation induces TAK1
activation in MDA-MB-231 cells and this activation
attenuates radiation-induced apoptosis by inducing
autophagy [32]. Treatment of TAK1 or autophagy

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitors overcomes radioresistance in cancer cells.
These studies suggest TAK1 is a rational target for cancer
treatment. Small molecules inhibitors of TAK1 have been
described recently. 5Z-O, a resorcylic lactone isolated
from fungal origin, is an irreversible ATP-competitive
inhibitor of TAK1 [33]. Chemically synthesized oxindole
derivates also show potent inhibitory effect on TAK1
at nanomolar to low micromolar concentration [34].
More recently, a series of 7-aminofuro[2,3-c]pyridine
inhibitors of TAK1 have been described [35]. These
inhibitors repressed proliferation of colon and ovarian
cancer cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth in
xenograft model. In this study, we showed that TAK1 is
highly activated in breast cancer and inhibition of TAK1
significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis.
Our results suggest TAK1 is a potential therapeutic target
for breast cancer.

MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
were obtained from the cell bank of the National Health
Research Institute (Miaoli, Taiwan). MCF-7 cell line was
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12
medium and MDAMB-231 was in RPMI 1640 medium,
both containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum
(FCS) and antibiotics.

Vehicle- or 5Z-O-treated cells were fixed with 1%
formaldehyde at 37°C for 10min. Cells were washed
twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing
protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), scraped, and
pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C. Cells were resuspended
in a lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, and 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.1), incubated for 10 min on ice, and sonicated
to shear DNA. After sonication, lysate was centrifuged for
10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was diluted

Care and Ethics Committee of the National Sun YatSen University. Female BALB/cAnN-Foxn1 null mice
(5 weeks old) were obtained from National Laboratory
Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). Mice were randomly
divided into two groups (n = 5 for each group) and
subjected to treatment. The control and TAB1 knockdown
MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 106 cells/mice) were injected
into left second thoracic mammary fat pad of nude mice.
Tumor volumes were measured every 3 days from the
second week after injection and were calculated using
the formula, V = (length) × (width)2 × 0.5. After 6 weeks,
animals were sacrificed and the tumors were excised and
subjected for immunoblotting and RT-PCR. Left axillary

Promoter activity assays
MDA-MB-231 cells (2 × 105 per well) were cultured
on 6-well plates and were transfected with 2μg CCR7
promoter luciferase reporter plasmid P1 (–500/+64), P2
(–223/+64) or P3 (–69/+64). After transfection, cells
were treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or various
concentrations of 5Z-O in 10% FCS medium for 24 h.
Promoter activity was determined and normalized as
described previously [24].

lymph nodes (defined as proximal lymph nodes because
they located at the same side of tumor injection site)
were excised and subjected for PCR to detect human
Alu sequence by using the following primers: forward:
5′-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3′; reverse: 5′-CCC
AGGCTGGAGTGCAGT -3′. In addition, right axillary
lymph nodes (defined as distal lymph nodes because they
located at the counter side of tumor injection site) were
also excised for PCR analysis.

Immunohistochemical analysis
Human breast cancer tissue array (catalog number
BR8015) was purchased from US Biomax (Rockville,
MD). The tumor samples included 58 invasive ductal
carcinoma, 8 medullary carcinoma and 4 ductal-lobular
mixed carcinoma and the array information was included
in Supplementary Table 1. Tissues were placed in citrate
buffer and incubated at 112°C for 20 min for antigen
retrieval. Tissues were blocked with a 3% hydrogen
peroxide solution to inhibit endogenous peroxidase
activity and washed with phosphate-buffered saline.
Tissues were probed with antibodies and bound primary
antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody and then developed
by diaminobenzidine substrate. Finally, sections were
co-stained with hematoxylin. The distribution of positive
staining was graded as follows: 1: less than 1% of cells; 2:
1–10% of cells (weak staining); 3: 11–50% of cells and 4:
>50% of cells. The intensity of positive staining was graded
as 0: negative; 1: weak and 2: strong. The distribution and
intensity scores were multiplied to obtain the final score.
The score ≧ 6 was defined as strong staining.
