Abstract
Podoplanin (PDPN) is a unique transmembrane receptor that promotes tumor
cell motility. Indeed, PDPN may serve as a chemotherapeutic target for primary
and metastatic cancer cells, particularly oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells
that cause most oral cancers. Here, we studied how a monoclonal antibody (NZ-1)
and lectin (MASL) that target PDPN affect human OSCC cell motility and viability.
Both reagents inhibited the migration of PDPN expressing OSCC cells at nanomolar
concentrations before inhibiting cell viability at micromolar concentrations. In
addition, both reagents induced mitochondrial membrane permeability transition
to kill OSCC cells that express PDPN by caspase independent nonapoptotic necrosis.
Furthermore, MASL displayed a surprisingly robust ability to target PDPN on OSCC cells
within minutes of exposure, and significantly inhibited human OSCC dissemination in
zebrafish embryos. Moreover, we report that human OSCC cells formed tumors that
expressed PDPN in mice, and induced PDPN expression in infiltrating host murine
cancer associated fibroblasts. Taken together, these data suggest that antibodies
and lectins may be utilized to combat OSCC and other cancers that express PDPN.

Introduction

yielding 5-year survival rates between 70% and 95% [5,
6]. However, patients with more advanced OSCC (stage
III or IV) have much lower 5 year survival rates, ranging
from 26% to 53% [5]. Cancer recurrence is found in up
to 76% of patients treated with surgery and radiation,
and many of these metastasize to distant sites [7, 8]. In
addition, these surgeries and radiation treatments can be
disfiguring and cause acute patient discomfort (e.g. oral
mucositis), as well as permanent sequelae [6, 9].

Approximately 300,000 new cases of oral cancer
are diagnosed each year, causing over 120,000 deaths
worldwide [1, 2]. Greater than 90% of these cancers are
oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) that proceed from
hyperplasia to dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive
carcinoma [3, 4]. Patients with early (stage I or II) OSCC
are generally treated with surgery and radiation therapy,

Oral cancer does not respond well to standard
chemotherapeutic agents. Taxanes, anthracyclines,
platinums, and antimetabolites have been used as adjuvant
oral cancer therapy for several decades [9]. For example,
methotrexate, cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil,
paclitaxel, and docetaxel are commonly used to treat
advanced OSCC [7]. In general, these agents have
shown significant toxicity and have had little effect on
outcomes [10, 11]. Collateral damage to dividing cells
can cause mucositis, renal dysfunction, neurotoxicity,
and haemotologic toxicities that can be debilitating and
even deadly [10, 12]. In fact, over 40 years of work and
clinical trials with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents have not
considerably increased survival rates or quality of life for
oral cancer patients [7, 11]. New treatments are clearly
needed to improve outcomes in this patient population.
Targeting specific extracellular receptors can lead
to successful cancer therapies. These targeted therapies
include tyrosine kinase blockers that inhibit the activities
of EGFR receptors (e.g. cetuximab, lapatinib) [13, 14],
as well as monoclonal antibodies that target the HER2/
NEU/ERB2 receptor (e.g. trastuzumab) or VEGFR2/KDR
ligands (e.g. bevacizumab) [15, 16]. Indeed, cetuximab
has shown promising results in clinical trials involving
OSCC [17, 18]. Undoubtedly, extracellular receptors are
valid targets for the treatment of human cancer.
OSCC cells present podoplanin (PDPN) as
a functionally relevant biomarker and potential
chemotherapeutic target. OSCC and premalignant
lesions often exhibit polymorphisms in cyclin D1, and
inactivation of tumor suppressors including p53, p16 and
p14 [19-21]. Increased expression of tumor promoters
including TIMPs, c-myc, cyclin D1, TGF-α, EGFR, and
PDPN are also often seen in these lesions [19, 22-24].
Taken together, reports indicate that PDPN expression
is notably increased in over 30% of pre-malignant oral
lesions and in over 60% of oral cancers. Moreover, PDPN
expression correlates with clinicopathological factors.
About 50% of T1 and T2 primary tumors display elevated
PDPN expression, and this number increases to about
75% for those at stages T3 and T4. In addition, over
70% of primary OSCC tumors with cervical lymph node
metastases express elevated levels of PDPN [5, 25-28].
Clinical studies also indicate that 5-year overall survival
(OS) rates continuously decrease from 93% for patients
with weak podoplanin expression, to 47% for patients
with moderate expression, to 23% for patients with high
levels of podoplanin expression [5, 29]. OSCC lethality
also correlates with PDPN expression, with undetectable,
weak, moderate, and high PDPN expression resulting
in 100%, 93%, 70%, and 37% 5-year disease-specific
survival (DSS) rates, respectively [29]. PDPN promotes
OSCC cell motility [30, 31] to drive tumor invasion and
metastasis that cause most oral cancer deaths [7, 32, 33].
PDPN is a transmembrane mucin-like protein
that augments tumor cell invasion. PDPN expression is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced by tumor promoters including TPA, RAS, and Src
[34-36]. The Src tyrosine kinase utilizes the focal adhesion
adaptor protein Cas/BCAR to induce PDPN expression in
order to promote tumor cell motility [34]. PDPN regulates
the activities of Rho, ezrin, and other proteins linked to
the actin cytoskeleton to mediate filopodia formation, cell
motility, invasion, and metastasis [37, 38]. Indeed, PDPN
expression enhances the motility and invasion of several
transformed cell types including mammary carcinoma
[37, 39], glioma [40], and OSCC [30, 31]. PDPN is
also located on lymphatic endothelial cells and cancer
associated fibroblasts which can augment tumor invasion
and metastasis [41, 42].
PDPN is found at the invasive front of many tumors,
which is consistent with its role in promoting invasion [37,
39]. As discussed above, PDPN expression is strongly
induced in most oral cancers [4, 5, 27, 28]. The bulk of
the PDPN protein, about 150 amino acids, lies outside of
the cell and could serve as an ideal target to combat cancer
growth and progression [37, 43]. For example, antibodies
against PDPN can inhibit the growth and metastasis of
tumor cells that express PDPN in mice [44-47].
While antibodies may offer significant targeting
specificity, they cannot be administered orally, and may
not possess intrinsic pharmaceutical effects on tumor
cell growth and migration seen with orally available
lectins [48-50]. The extracellular domain of PDPN is
O-glycosylated with sialic acid α2,3 linked to galactose
[37]. PDPN is activated by endogenous lectins that bind
to these extracellular carbohydrate moieties [51, 52] to
induce tumor cell motility and metastasis [39, 53, 54].
Thus, blocking this interaction between PDPN and its
ligands should inhibit malignant progression. For instance,
compounds blocking the action of galectins, which activate
mucin receptors, can inhibit tumor cell metastasis [55, 56].
Although some lectins may nonspecifically bind to many
glycoproteins, Maackia amurensis seed lectin (MASL) can
precisely target specific glycoproteins expressed by human
cells [57, 58]. In fact, MASL, which has a high affinity for
O-linked carbohydrate chains containing sialic acid [59,
60], targets PDPN in order to inhibit tumor cell growth
and motility at nanomolar concentrations [61].
Here, we compare the effects of anti-PDPN antibody
and MASL on OSCC cell motility and growth. These
results indicate that both reagents affect OSCC cells at
similar concentrations and by comparable mechanisms.
However, MASL presents very efficient targeting
dynamics and an advantage of oral administration.

Results

oral cancer patients presented in Table 2. Western blot
analysis found that these HSC-2, HSC-4, and HSQ89 cells all expressed PDPN, but at decreasing levels,
respectively (Figure 2a and 2b). These data are consistent
with immunohistochemistry results shown in Figure 1b
and Table 2. Moreover, as shown in Figure 2c, PDPN
expression levels correlated with the ability of these cells
to migrate as measured by wound healing assays. These
data are consistent with reports indicating that PDPN
expression can increase cell migration.

PDPN expression correlates with OSCC cell
motility
As described above, PDPN is a functionally relevant
biomarker and potential chemotherapeutic target expressed
by malignant OSCC cells. Immunohistochemistry found
PDPN expression in OSCC specimens from oral cancer
patients, as well as from a patient with leukoplakia as
shown in Figure 1a and Table 1. Immunohistochemistry
also detected PDPN expression in cultured OSCC cells as
shown in Figure 1b and Table 2.
Since PDPN can promote cell migration, we sought
to evaluate the relationship between its expression with
OSCC cell motility. PDPN expression and cell migration
were examined in a panel of cell lines generated from

Agents that target PDPN inhibit OSCC cell
motility and growth in a PDPN dependent manner
Previous studies indicate that antibodies and lectins
can be used to target PDPN in order to inhibit tumor cell
migration and growth. These reagents are exemplified
by NZ-1 antibody and MASL lectin [45, 61-64]. We

utilized HSC-2, HSC-4, and HSQ-89 cells to evaluate the
effects of NZ-1 and MASL on cell migration. As shown
in Figure 3a and Supplemental Figure 1, MASL and
NZ-1 both inhibited OSCC cell migration at nanomolar
concentrations. Migration of HSC-2 cells, which expressed
the highest levels of PDPN, was effectively inhibited by
770 nM NZ-1 and MASL. HSC-4 cell migration was
effectively inhibited by 770 nM NZ-1, but required 1540
nM MASL to achieve similar results. Neither MASL nor
NZ-1 showed significant effects on HSQ-89 cells, which
exhibited only nominal migration and PDPN expression
levels. These data indicate that NZ-1 and MASL both
inhibit cell migration in a manner that correlates with
PDPN expression.
In addition to inhibiting migration, MASL and NZ-1
both suppressed OSCC cell growth as shown in Figure
3b and Supplemental Figure 2. These reagents inhibited

the growth of HSC-2 cells by over 80% and HSC-4
cells by over 60% at a 2.3 µM concentration. HSQ-89
cells were less sensitive to these reagents, with 2.3 µM
NZ-1 inhibiting growth by about 50%, and MASL by
about 15%. Since HSQ-89 cells exhibited only nominal
migration and PDPN expression levels, they may not
have been as effectively targeted by these reagents.
Taken together, these data indicate that NZ-1 and MASL
inhibited cell migration prior to suppressing cell growth.
Moreover, both reagents preferentially targeted cells that
express PDPN, and MASL exhibited specificity at least as
strong as the NZ-1 monoclonal antibody.
RhoA and Rac1 GTPase activity has been implicated
in PDPN induced cell migration [65-67]. Therefore, we
sought to determine if reagents that target PDPN can
decrease GTPase activity in order to inhibit OSCC cell
motility and growth. As shown in Figure 4, neither NZ-1

nor MASL appeared to decrease RhoA or Rac1 GTPase
activity at concentrations that inhibit OSCC cell growth
or motility. Indeed, instead of decreasing RhoA and Rac1,
these reagents seemed to cause a slight increase in these
GTPase activities. However, in contrast to RhoA and
Rac1, both NZ-1 and MASL appeared to decrease Cdc42
GTPase activity (Figure 4). These data suggest that both
reagents may interfere with GTPase control of directional
movement, as opposed to mechanisms directing the
formation of protractions and protrusions, to inhibit cell
migration, even at nontoxic concentrations (e.g. 770 nM)
[68].

As shown in Figure 8a, MASL associated with the
plasma membrane after only 2 minutes of exposure on
HSC-2 cells. In contrast, NZ-1 was not found to associate
with these cells, even after prolonged incubation periods
of several hours. Immunofluorescence analysis, shown in
Figure 8b and Supplemental Figure 3, found that MASL
and PDPN associated with each other on the plasma
membrane of these cells. Thus, MASL targeted PDPN

NZ-1 and MASL affect OSCC cell viability
without inducing apoptotic caspase activation
Effects of NZ-1 and MASL on OSCC cell
morphology suggest that these reagents caused
necrotic cell death as seen in Figure 5. Although some
membrane blebbing was observed, both reagents caused
morphological changes indicative of necrosis in HSC-2
and HSC-4 cells. HSQ-89 cells did not exhibit notable
changes in morphology, which may be expected from
reduced sensitivity to NZ-1 or, particularly, MASL as
shown in Figure 3.
Effects on morphology suggest that NZ-1 and
MASL utilize similar mechanisms to inhibit cell growth,
but that cells can react differently to these effects. For
example, both compounds induced some membrane
blebbing of HSC-2 cells, but not HSC-4 cells. Effects of
NZ-1 and MASL on caspase 8 and PARP cleavage were
evaluated to further elucidate mechanisms behind their
cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 6, NZ-1 and MASL
treated cells did not display significant levels of caspase
8 cleavage in response to these compounds. While some
PARP cleavage was seen in HSC-2 cells treated with
MASL, this was not found in NZ-1 treated HSC-2 cells
or in the other cell lines treated with either reagent (Figure
6). These data suggest that caspase activation was not
essential for NZ-1 or MASL toxicity.
The pan-caspase blocker Z-VAD-FMK and the
mitochondrial membrane permeability transition blocker
cyclosporin A were used to further investigate mechanisms
underlying MASL and NZ-1 toxicity in HSC-2 and HSC-4
cells. As shown in Figure 7, Z-VAD-FMK did not protect
either cell line from MASL or NZ-1 toxicity. In contrast,
cyclosporin A decreased toxicity of NZ-1 and MASL by
several fold in both cell lines (p<0.0004 by t-test). Taken
together, these data indicate that NZ-1 and MASL induce
mitochondrial membrane permeability transition to kill
OSCC cells by caspase independent nonapoptotic necrosis.

model to examine the effects of MASL on OSCC tumor
cell dissemination. B16 melanoma cells were included
in this study since previous reports indicate that MASL
can inhibit their tumorigenesis in mice [61]. As shown in
Figure 9, 770 nM MASL inhibited melanoma and OSCC
tumor cell dissemination in this system by about 30%.
This effect was significant, with p values below 0.001 and
0.05 for melanoma and OSCC cells by t-test, respectively.

observed.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is
considered a risk factor for OSCC. However, OSCC HPV
status is highly variable, and is associated with a variety of
factors including geographic area and prevalence of other
risk factors [84]. We found all cases evaluated in this study
to be HPV negative (Supplemental Figure 4). In contrast
to HPV, PDPN expression in these samples appears as a
functionally relevant biomarker leading to OSCC motility.
In addition to cancer cells themselves, PDPN
expression in cancer associated fibroblasts has been
associated with tumor aggression and poor clinical
outcomes [85]. This has been found in a variety of cancers
including mammary carcinoma [86, 87], melanoma
[88], lung squamous cell carcinoma [89], esophageal
adenocarcinoma [90], and OSCC [91]. Interestingly,
human HSC-2 cells form tumors that express PDPN in
mice, and also induce PDPN expression in infiltrating
mouse cancer associate fibroblasts within the stroma of
the tumor as shown in Figure 10. These data are consistent
with recent findings that cancer associated fibroblasts
express PDPN to promote the motility and survival of
neighboring tumor cells [72].
Antibodies against PDPN can be used to inhibit
tumor progression [44-47]. However, in vivo antibody
administration is challenging [48-50]. Unlike antibodies,
lectins are resistant to gastrointestinal proteolysis [92-94],
and can be taken orally to treat cancer [56, 93, 95]. In
addition to carbohydrate modifications, lectin interactions
are guided by amino acid residues of their target receptor
proteins. Previous studies have shown that MASL
associates with PDPN on the membrane of melanoma cells
[61]. This study found that MASL can target PDPN on
OSCC cells with remarkable dynamics, exceeding that of
NZ-1 antibody which binds to PDPN with a dissociation
constant of less than 1 nM [64, 96].
PDPN has emerged as a clear target for oral cancers
and precancerous lesions [97, 98]. Previous studies
demonstrate that MASL can survive digestion and enter
the circulatory system to inhibit tumor progression in
mammals [61]. We show here that MASL can target
PDPN to inhibit OSCC cell growth and motility.
However, targeting of MASL to other sialic acid modified
receptors on cancer cells cannot be ruled out. Future
studies should investigate this possibility. Interestingly,
Maackia amurensis has been used for many centuries as
a medicinal plant to treat ailments including cancer [99103]. This work sheds light on potential mechanisms that
may be exploited to expand our arsenal of targeted cancer
treatments, particularly agents that can be administered
orally.

PDPN has emerged as a functionally relevant cancer
biomarker and chemotherapeutic target [37, 71]. PDPN is
necessary and sufficient to increase tumor cell migration.
Oncogenic kinases and PDPN expression vectors augment
cell migration [34, 72] and, conversely, agents including
siRNA constructs that decrease PDPN expression inhibit
cell migration [34, 61, 73]. This has been shown for a
variety of cell types including nontransformed and Src
transformed cells [34, 72], melanoma [61], and OSCC
cells [73-75].
Indeed, PDPN signaling promotes invasion and
metastasis of many types of cancer cells [71]. In particular,
increased PDPN expression correlates with the aggressive
potential of OSCC cells [76]. These cancer cells are
remarkably resistant to currently available chemotherapy
treatments [7, 11, 77]. PDPN could serve as a target for
more effective treatments to improve outcomes in this
patient population. Here, we evaluated how an antibody
and lectin that target PDPN affect OSCC cell growth and
motility.
Evaluation of cell lines in this study confirmed that
PDPN expression correlates with OSCC cell motility.
These findings are consistent with PDPN increasing cell
migration. It has become very clear that PDPN acts as an
important effector of signaling events that underlie cancer
progression. Thus, PDPN may present an opportunity
to interrupt oncogenic signaling cascades that induce its
expression such as those initiated by a number of tumor
promoters including Ras [35, 36], FGF/BMP [78], Src
[34], EGF [73], and TGFβ [79, 80].
Quantitation of the effects of NZ-1 and MASL
on OSCC cell growth and migration indicate that these
compounds inhibit cell migration prior to initiating
cytotoxicity. For example, MASL completely inhibits
OSCC motility at 770 nM, but requires higher
concentrations of over 2 µM to effectively inhibit cell
viability. These studies also indicate that NZ-1 and MASL
induce mitochondrial membrane permeability transition
to kill OSCC cells by caspase independent nonapoptotic
necrosis. Many cancer cells contain mutations that enable
them to migrate and evade caspase mediated apoptosis
[81]. Thus, reagents that target PDPN may provide a
way to induce caspase independent necrosis in otherwise
resistant human OSCC cells.
Although NZ-1 and MASL showed similar effects
on cells, they displayed differences in cell binding
dynamics. Effects of antibody binding to the PDPN
receptor should be considered. For example, perhaps,
antibody binding may stimulate PDPN cleavage (e.g. by
calpain [82] or presenilin [83]) on the membrane of living
cells. These results also suggest that cytotoxic effects of
NZ-1 and MASL result from signaling events initiated
at the plasma membrane since internalization of these
compounds into PDPN expressing OSCC cells was not

and mouse experimental protocols were approved by
the University Institutional Review Board (study ID
Pro2012001544) and Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (APR 10579), respectively.

Evaluation of cell growth and migration
HSC-2, HSC-4, and HSQ-89 cells have been
previously described [73], and were maintained in DMEM
(Hyclone SH30021) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES
(Hyclone SH30237) and FBS (Seradigm 1400-500) at
37oC in 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. Effects of reagents
on cell viability were measured by plating cells at 12%
confluence and growing overnight on standard 12 well
tissue culture plates (Cyto One CC7682-7512), treating
for 24 hours with MASL (Sentrimed) or NZ-1 (prepared
as described [46, 53, 104, 105]), and counting cells after
staining with Trypan blue. For wound healing migration
assays, confluent cell monolayers were treated for 24
hours with MASL or NZ-1, scratched, and migration was
quantitated as the number of cells that entered a 200 x
300 micron area in the center of the wound at 18 hours as
previously described [61, 72].

Live cell imaging and immunofluorescence studies
Live cell imaging was performed on HSC-2 cells
cultured on 35mm poly-D-lysine–coated glass bottom
culture dishes (MatTek Corp., P35GC-1.5-14-C). Nuclei
were stained with 5 µg/ml of Hoechst 33352 (Life
Technologies, H1399). Cells were rinsed with PBS,
incubated with 200 µg/ml MASL conjugated with red
fluorescent dye (Thermo scientific Dylight 594, 53044)
or 200 µg/ml NZ-1 conjugated to green fluorescent dye
(Thermo scientific DyLight 488, 53024) for 2 minutes,
rinsed thrice with PBS, and fed media. Images were
immediately obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope as
described [108].
Immunofluorescence was performed on HSC2 cells cultured on 35mm poly-D-lysine–coated glass
bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp., P35GC-1.5-14-C),
fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in DPBS (Life
Technologies, 14040-091) for 5 minutes at 4°C, rinsed
with cold 1% PFA, air-dried, and rinsed again with cold
DPBS. Cells were then treated with D2-40 PDPN antibody
(Dako, M3619) at 1.3 µg/mL for 3 hours, washed, and
then labeled with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to
Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies, A-11001) at 20 µg/
mL for 1.5 hours. Cells were then rinsed with DPBS and
treated with MASL conjugated with red fluorescent dye
(Thermo scientific Dylight 594, 53044) at 0.4 mg/mL for
5 minutes. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33352 (Life
Technologies, H1399). Images were obtained on a Zeiss
Axiovert microscope as described [108].

HPV analysis
DNA was extracted and analyzed by a proprietary
HPV Type-Detect 2.0 Bio-Plex diagnostic analysis
(Medical Diagnostic Laboratories, Hamilton, NJ) that was
designed to detect HPV subtypes 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33,
35, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. An
internal amplification control was included for all samples
to verify successful extraction and a lack of PCR inhibitors
in the original specimen. Reactions also included negative
template controls to calculate CT values above background
as well as HPV-type specific DNA and allele specific
primer extension (ASPE) positive controls to demonstrate
overall assay success. Results for HPV-16 and HPV-18
were also confirmed by a proprietary multiplex real-time
PCR assay (Medical Diagnostic Laboratories, Hamilton,
NJ) interpreted with Rotor-Gene software (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA).

Western blotting and GTPase analysis
Western blotting was performed as described
previously [61, 72]. Briefly, protein was resolved by SDSPAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore
IH1079562), and incubated with antisera specific for
PDPN (NZ-1), PARP (Cell Signaling Technology 9542),
Caspase 8 (Cell Signaling Technology 9746), or GAPDH
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology A1978). Primary antiserum
was recognized by appropriate secondary antiserum
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and detected using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific 32106).
After blotting, membranes were stained with India ink to
verify equal loading and transfer.
Active GTPase was detected in OSCC cells as
described [109]. Briefly, HSC-2 cells were grown to
60-70% confluence, treated with 0 nM, 770 nM, and

Immunohistochemistry
Surgical specimens were fixed in 10% formalin
in PBS, paraffin embedded, sectioned (4 microns),
and processed for hematoxylin/eosin staining and
immunohistochemistry with 8.1.1 and D2-40 monoclonal
antibodies (Dako) to detect mouse and human PDPN,
respectively, as described [61, 106, 107]. OSCC cells
were cultured in chamber slides (Lab-Tek 177445), fixed
in 10% formalin, and processed for immunohistochemistry
as described above. For mouse xenograft studies, 1
million HSC-2 cells were injected into the left flank
of immunodeficient NOD scid gamma mice (Jackson

Utilization of caspase and mitochondrial
membrane permeability transition blockers
The Z-VAD-FMK pan-caspase blocker and
cyclosporin A mitochondrial membrane permeability
transition blocker were used as previously described
[110-112]. Briefly, cells were grown to 40% confluence
in standard culture dishes, washed and incubated for 1.5
hours with 10 µM Z-VAD-FMK (Calbiochem 219007)
or 100 nM cyclosporin A (Calbiochem 239835) prior
to the addition of NZ-1 or MASL, incubated for an
additional 16 hours, released from the plates with trypsin,
washed and resuspended in PBS with 5 mM propidium
iodide for 5 minutes, pelleted, and resuspended in PBS.
The percentage of viable cells was determined using a
Cellometer (Nexelom, Lawrence, MA), as the ratio of the
number of fluorescent cells (propidium iodide positive) to
total cells.

Zebrafish tumor cell dissemination assay
The metastatic potential of human squamous cell
carcinoma (HSC-2) or melanoma (B16) cells were tested
by zebrafish tumor xenograft cell dissemination assays as
described [69, 70]. Briefly, tumor cells were labeled with
DiI (Invitrogen 3899), suspended at 100 million cells/mL,
and injected into 2 day old transgenic fli1a:EGFP embryos
(ZIRC, Eugene, Oregon) anesthetized with 0.04% MS222 (Sigma E10521) at 300-500 cells/embryo. Correct
implantation was verified by fluorescence microscopy
(Nikon SMZ1500 with NIS Elements F software) shortly
after injection, and embryos in which cells were already
present in circulation were removed. Embryos were
then incubated for 3 days in PTU-supplemented E3
water without methylene blue (Sigma P7629) with and
without 770 nM MASL (Sentrimed). Embryos were then
anesthetized and disseminated tumor cells were counted
as the number of fluorescent DiI labeled cells anterior
to the anal opening at 5 days post fertilization. Three
independent experiments were done with similar results.
