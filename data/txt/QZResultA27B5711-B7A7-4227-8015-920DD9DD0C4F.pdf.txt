Abstract
The proteasome is clinically validated as a target for cancer
therapeutics. However, proteasome-inhibitory agents that are
cancer selective have yet to be developed. In this study, we report
the identiﬁcation of a safe and effective proteasome inhibitor with
selective anticancer properties. We screened a chemical library
constructed using a hybrid approach that incorporated a 4-piperazinylquinoline scaffold and a sulfonyl phamarcophore. From
this library, we identiﬁed 7-chloro-4-(4-(2,4-dinitrophenylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)quinoline (VR23) as a small molecule
that potently inhibited the activities of trypsin-like proteasomes
(IC50 ¼ 1 nmol/L), chymotrypsin-like proteasomes (IC50 ¼ 50–
100 nmol/L), and caspase-like proteasomes (IC50 ¼ 3 mmol/L).
Data from molecular docking and substrate competition assays
established that the primary molecular target of VR23 was b2 of
the 20S proteasome catalytic subunit. Notably, VR23 was struc-

turally distinct from other known proteasome inhibitors and
selectively killed cancer cells by apoptosis, with little effect on
noncancerous cells. Mechanistic investigations showed that
cancer cells exposed to VR23 underwent an abnormal centrosome ampliﬁcation cycle caused by the accumulation of ubiquitinated cyclin E. In combinations with the clinically
approved chymotrypsin-like proteasome inhibitor bortezomib,
VR23 produced a synergistic effect in killing multiple myeloma
cells, including those that were resistant to bortezomib. VR23
was effective in vivo in controlling multiple myelomas and
metastatic breast cancer cells, in the latter case also enhancing
the antitumor activity of paclitaxel while reducing its side
effects. Overall, our results identify VR23 as a structurally novel
proteasome inhibitor with desirable properties as an anticancer
agent. Cancer Res; 75(19); 4164–75. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

in somatic cells is normally semiconservative, although centrosomes can also be synthesized by de novo assembly when residential centrioles are removed (9–11). In this case, the numerical
control of the centrosome is usually lost, resulting in a variable
number of centrosomes per cell (10).
Proteasomes play a critical role in regulating the level of
cellular proteins and recycling damaged and misfolded proteins. Although essential for normal cell regulation, proteasome activity is especially critical for the proliferation and
survival of cancer cells. Chen and Madura found that the level
and activity of proteasomes are higher by >90% in primary
tumors, compared with normal tissues (12). These authors also
found that MCF10A, a nonmalignant breast cell line, did not
show any increase in proteasome activity. High levels of proteasomes were also observed in acute lymphocytic leukemia,
T-cell leukemia, and acute myelocytic leukemia cells (13). It is
thought that the high level of proteasome activity in cancer cells
provides survival beneﬁts under the stress of continued cell
proliferation (14, 15).
The inhibition of proteolysis can not only activate apoptosis
but may also prevent angiogenesis and metastasis (16, 17). Since
the ﬁrst proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) was
approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma in
2003, many proteasome inhibitors have been reported (18, 19).
Although bortezomib and carﬁlzomib (Kyprolis) are quite effective for the treatment of multiple myeloma and other blood
cancers, they either show considerable side effects or are ineffective against solid tumors (20–22).

Centrosome duplication is strictly regulated to maintain genetic stability, and its deregulation may result in the development of
tumors or microcephaly (1). Along with other proteins, cyclin E is
essential for centrosome duplication; however, its overexpression
can induce abnormal centrosome ampliﬁcation, aneuploidy, and
eventually tumorigenesis (2–5). Not surprisingly, the level of
cyclin E is generally higher in cancer than normal cells, which
makes malignant cells more vulnerable to centrosome ampliﬁcation (6, 7). Interestingly, however, cyclin E can be dispensable
for cell proliferation (8), suggesting that centrosome duplication
is governed by redundant mechanisms. Centrosome duplication

Anticancer Property of VR23 Proteasome Inhibitor

We previously found that the antiproliferative effect of
4-piperazinylquinoline-isatin hybrid compounds is substantially more active for cancer than noncancer cells (23).
Other groups showed that sulfonyl derivatives often possess
effective antitumor activity (24). Therefore, we designed, synthesized, and examined the anticancer activities of novel 4piperazinyl/amino quinoline–derived sulfonyl compounds on
the assumption that the hybridization of a quinoline scaffold
and a sulfonamide phamarcophore could lead to molecules
with desirable anticancer property (Fig. 1A). We report here
that 7-chloro-4-(4-(2,4-dinitrophenylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)
quinoline (VR23), one of these novel compounds, causes
apoptosis in a cancer-speciﬁc manner through the inhibition
of proteasome activity and cyclin E-mediated abnormal centrosome ampliﬁcation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and synchronization
All the cancer cell lines used, including RPMI 8226-BR and
ANBL6-BR ("BR" is for bortezomib resistance), were grown in
RPMI1640 or DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. RPMI 8226,
KAS6/1, ANBL6, RPMI 8226-BR, and ANBL6-BR were kind gifts of
Dr. R. Orlowski (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;
refs. 25, 26). IL6–dependent cells (KAS6/1, ANBL6, ANBL6-BR)
were further supplemented with 1 ng/mL of IL6. MCF10A and
184B5 cells were grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with
growth factors and 10% equine serum. Cell line authentication
was performed by Genetica DNA Laboratories using short tandem
repeat proﬁling (March 2015). Double thymidine–based cell
synchronization at G1–S was carried out as described previously

(27). For synchronization at G2–M, cells were maintained in
5 ng/mL of nocodazole for 18 hours.
Proteasome assay
Exponentially growing cells on a 96-well clustered plate were
treated with different concentrations of drugs or left untreated
(control) for 6 hours. Proteasomes extracted with 0.5% NP40
buffer were mixed with equal amounts of samples in 100 mL total
volume, and then incubated with 25 mmol/L of ﬂuorogenic
substrates (Boston Biochem; LRR- speciﬁc for trypsin-like activity,
LLE-speciﬁc for caspase-like activity, and SUVY-speciﬁc for chymotrypsin-like activity) in black-bottom 96-well plates at 37 C.
Fluorescence was monitored every 5 minutes at the wavelength of
360 nm (excitation) and 480 nm (emission).
In vitro ﬂurogenic substrate competition assay
For a typical assay, 2 nmol/L of puriﬁed human 20S proteasome proteins (E-360, Boston Biochem) was added to a 96-well
black-bottom clustered plate containing VR23 (ﬁnal concentration, 0.1 mmol/L) in a total volume of 100 mL assay buffer (20
mmol/L HEPES, 0.5 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0 with a ﬁnal SDS
concentration of 0.035%) per well. Several different concentrations of substrate were added to the samples after they were
preincubated for 1 hour at 37 C (e.g., 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200
mmol/L of LRR and Suc-LLVY, respectively, speciﬁc for trypsin-like
activity and chymotrypsin-like proteasome activities). Hydrolysis
reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes (chymotrypsinlike substrate) and 1 hour (trypsin-like substrate) at 37 C.
The ﬂuorescence was measured at 380 nm excitation/460 emission at 30 minutes (for some experiments at 15, 30, 45, and 60
minutes). Data were analyzed with GraphPad PrismV using a
double-reciprocal Lineweaver–Burk plot or by nonlinear regression curve analysis (Michaelis–Menten kinetics) as described
previously (28).
Animal work
Five-week-old female ATH490 (athymic nude mice strain 490)
were purchased from Charles River. Animals were monitored for
food and water consumption every day, and twice per week for
body weight and tumor weight/volume. Tumor volume, measured with a caliper, was determined using the following formula:
1
/2 length  width2. Blood samples were collected (D15 or D29)
by cardiac puncture and processed for alanine transaminase/
aspartate aminotransferase (AST/ALT) measurements. Tumors
and organs were harvested and ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin
at 4 C overnight before processing for parafﬁn embedding. Each
section of tumors and organs (4–5 mm thick) was stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Some tumor sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with antibody speciﬁc for Ki-67,
VEGF or CD31.
Animal Care Committee at Laurentian University (Ontario,
Canada) reviewed and approved all aspects of animal experiments, including animal handling, care, treatments, and endpoint
determination. The human MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cell line and RPMI 8226 multiple myeloma cells used were
purchased from ATCC.
Anticancer activity of VR23 in xenograft mice
To establish tumors in mice, exponentially growing MDAMB-231 or RPMI 8226 cells (10  106 cells in 0.2 mL of ice-cold
1 PBS) were subcutaneously injected into the ﬂank of each

4166 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

animal. When tumor size reached 4 to 5 mm in diameter, mice
were usually randomized into the following ﬁve groups (n ¼ 4–6
per group): (i) untreated control, (ii) vehicle/sham control, (iii)
VR23-treated sample, in which animals were administered intraperitoneally twice per week with VR23 (30 mg/kg body weight);
(iv) paclitaxel-treated samples, in which animals were given
intravenously with paclitaxel (20 mg/kg/week); and (v) combinational group, in which paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) was given (intravenously) 24 hours prior to VR23 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) per week.
Statistical analyses
All values are mean  S.E.M of at least three independent
experiments. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
software. Comparison between groups was made by P value using
one-way ANOVA: P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
VR23 is a novel proteasome inhibitor targeting b2 of the 20S
proteasome subunit
Screening of the newly created chemical library (above) using
three breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and
MCF7) and two nonmalignant breast cell lines (184B5 and
MCF10A) identiﬁed (VR23; Fig. 1B) as being a potentially effective and safe anticancer agent, as it killed/inhibited proliferation
of cancer cells 2.6 to 17.6 times more effectively than noncancer
cells (Fig. 1C). In addition, VR23 showed at least an additive
effect when used in combination with paclitaxel (Supplementary
Table S1).
Our preliminary data showed that VR23 slowed down cell-cycle
progression, which is often observed in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (29). Furthermore, a quinoline, from which the
basic scaffold of VR23 was derived, is a weak proteasome inhibitor
(28). Therefore, we postulated that VR23 would possess proteasome inhibition property. As expected, data from a ﬂuorogenic
assay using extracts from three cell lines (HeLa, MCF7, and MDAMB-231) showed that VR23 is a very effective inhibitor of trypsinlike proteasome (IC50, 1 nmol/L; Fig. 1D). In addition, VR23
substantially inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteasome (IC50, 50–
100 nmol/L) and caspase-like proteasome (3 mmol/L; Fig. 1D). As
the target of trypsin-like proteasome inhibitors is b2 of the 20S
proteasome catalytic subunit (19, 30), and as vinyl sulfones are
known to covalently modify b peptide through the hydroxyl
group of threonine and the double bond of the vinyl sulfone
moiety (19, 31, 32), we carried out in silico docking analysis using
MOE (see Supplementary Materials and Methods) to examine
this possibility. As anticipated, VR23 ﬁts into the pockets of the
b2 subunit (both H and V chains) with low energy (5.6288
kcal/mol and 5.5983 kcal/mol, respectively) and low root mean
square deviation (RMSD, 0.6715 Å and 0.0035 Å, respectively;
Fig. 1E and F). To conﬁrm the interaction between VR23 and b2
subunit, we carried out a substrate competition assay. Our data
plotted according to Lineweaver–Burk (28) conﬁrm that VR23
effectively competes with substrates of trypsin-like proteasome.
However, our data also indicate that VR23 inhibits trypsin-like
proteasome by noncompetitive allosteric binding, as the x-axis
interception point changes in the presence of VR23 (Fig. 1G).
As ubiquitination is an early step in the proteasome-mediated
protein degradation, we examined the level of protein ubiquitination. As expected, ubiquitinated proteins accumulated in HeLa

Anticancer Property of VR23 Proteasome Inhibitor

cells exposed to VR23 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1H),
indicating that proteins are ubiquitinated, but not degraded by
proteasomes in the presence of VR23. The chemical structure of
VR23 does not show similarity with any known proteasome
inhibitors, suggesting that it is a novel class (18, 19).
When combined with bortezomib, VR23 shows synergistic
effects on RPMI 8226 and KAS 6/1 multiple myeloma cells
As proteasome inhibitors are often used for the treatment
of multiple myeloma, we determined IC50 values of VR23 on
RPMI 8226 and KAS 6 cells, which were found to be 2.94 and
1.46 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2A). The combination of 1.25
mmol/L VR23 and a low-dose bortezomib (e.g., 5 nmol/L) showed
highly synergistic effect on both RPMI 8226 [combinational index
(CI), 0.37] and KAS 6 cells (CI, 0.57; Fig. 2B and C). Interestingly,
VR23 is more effective on bortezomib-resistant RPMI 8226
than on na€ve RPMI 8226 (Fig. 2D). VR23 is found to be equally

effective on both na€ve and bortezomib-resistant ANBL 6/1 cell
(Fig. 2D). When combined with 10 nmol/L bortezomib, VR23
dramatically reduces the viability of two bortezomib-resistant
multiple myeloma cell lines examined (Fig. 2E and F).
VR23 causes apoptosis in a cancer-speciﬁc manner
A clonogenic assay showed that very few MCF7 cells survived
for 2 weeks at 1.5 mmol/L of VR23 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Data
from ﬂow cytometry showed that the treatment of MCF7 with
2.7or 8.0 mmol/L of VR23 resulted in 23.7% or 38.1% sub-G1
DNA content within 48 hours after treatment, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In contrast, the ﬂow cytometry proﬁles of
MCF10A cells were not notably different between the sham
control and VR23-treated samples, up to 8 mmol/L and 72 hours
after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These data demonstrate that, unlike MCF7, the noncancer MCF10A is much more
resistant to VR23, which is consistent with data shown in Fig. 1C.

Figure 2.
Combination of VR23 and bortezomib (BTZ) shows synergistic effects. A, data shown are IC50 values of bortezomib and VR23 determined by the sulforhodamine
B assay (48 hours after treatment) on two multiple myeloma and two noncancer lines (184B5, MCF10A). B and C, the combination of 1.25 mmol/L VR23 and
RPMI 8226 (5 nmol/L) or KAS 6/1 (0.625 nmol/L) shows highly synergistic effects, as CI is 0.37 and 0.57, respectively. CI < 1.0, CI ¼ 1.0, and CI > 1.0 are synergistic,
additive and antagonistic, respectively (46). D, VR23 is equally effective on both bortezomib (BTZ)-sensitive and -resistant cells. E and F, the combination of
bortezomib and VR23 is effective on bortezomib-resistant RPMI 8226 cells (E) and bortezomib-resistant ANBL6 cells (F). RPMI 8226-BR cells were treated
with either 10 nmol/L bortezomib, 2.5 mmol/L VR23, or combination of the two. ANBLC6-BR cells were treated with either 10 nmol/L bortezomib, 5 mmol/L VR23,
or combination of the two. Data, mean  SEM (n 2; P < 0.005 for all cell lines).

Pundir et al.

To examine VR23-induced impediment of cell-cycle progression in more detail, HeLa cells arrested at G2–M by nocodazole
were released into cell cycle at 0 hours in the absence (control) or
presence of 5 mmol/L VR23 for 2, 4, or 8 hours. Under these
conditions, over 30% of cells underwent DNA fragmentation (as
manifested by sub-G1 DNA) within 4 hours in the presence of
VR23, suggesting that cells are dying by apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). As expected, PARP1 was cleaved in response to VR23,
conﬁrming that VR23 induces apoptosis (Supplementary Figs.
S1B, S1D, and S2A). It is known that the activation of apoptosis at
mitosis often depends on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (33).
Consistent with this previous observation, high levels of phosphorylated p38 are shown in cells treated with VR23 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Thus, we conclude that VR23 induces apoptosis
in mitotic cancer cells through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. It
should also be noted that the level of cyclin E was much higher in
cells treated with VR23 than control, even when over 30% of cells
were already dead (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
To gain further insights into VR23 effects during G2–M, we
examined the interactions of proteins involved in the regulation
of metaphase progression. At 0 hours after nocodazole, cells were
released into complete medium for 0.5 to 4 hours in the absence
or presence of VR23 (5 mmol/L). The association of Cdc20 with
Cdc27, which is required for the activation of anaphase promoting complex (APC; ref. 34), is peaked at 1 hour after nocodazole in
control. In contrast, only a low level of the Cdc20–Cdc27 complex
is detected in the VR23-treated sample at the same time point
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). The spindle checkpoint protein BuBR1
is activated by kinetochores that are not fully attached to microtubules (35). Activated BuBR1 then inhibits the capability of APC
to ubiquitinate securin and cyclin B and, thereby, prevents mitotic
exit until cells are completely ready (36). As expected, high levels
of BuBR1–Cdc20 association are shown in controls at all of the
time points examined. In contrast, cells exposed to VR23 showed
only a low level of BuBR1–Cdc20 association until 1 hour, after
which the association is barely detectable. These data suggest that
some cells in VR23-treated samples may progress through anaphase up to 1 hour after nocodazole; however, most cells do not
activate mitotic spindle checkpoint. Emi1 (early mitotic inhibitor
1; FBX5; FBXO5) regulates progression of cells through early
mitosis by inhibiting APC (37). Emi1 prevents APC activation
through its binding to APC, Cdc20 or Fzr1/Cdh1. As expected,
Emi1 strongly associated with APC during the ﬁrst 30 minutes
after release from nocodazole, followed by only low levels of
association up to 2 hours in the control. These data suggest that
cells released into drug-free medium have largely passed prometaphase-metaphase transition by 1 hour after nocodazole. In
contrast, the Emi1–Cdc20 complex is not detected in cells treated
with VR23, except 2 hours after nocodazole. As the associations of
Cdc20 with Emi1 and with BuBR1 usually occur prophase and
prometaphase, respectively (38), we conclude that cells exposed
to VR23 are largely arrested at prometaphase. This interpretation
is consistent with data obtained by confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S3A, white arrows).
VR23 treatment resulted in the accumulation of cyclin E at
centrosomes, leading to its ampliﬁcation in a cancer cell–
speciﬁc manner
Data obtained by confocal microscopy showed that VR23
causes abnormal ampliﬁcation of microtubule organization centers (MTOC) in MCF7 (Supplementary Fig. S3A, yellow arrows).

4168 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

Under the experimental conditions, most chromosomes are condensed but not aligned at the equatorial plate, indicating that
cells have not yet reached metaphase (Supplementary Fig. S3A,
white arrows). To gain a better understanding, cells synchronized
at G1–S were released into cell cycle for 6 hours, at which time
most cells are around G2–M (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Cells were
then maintained for additional 6 hours in the presence of VR23.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3C, multiple centrosomes cause
either cell-cycle arrest before metaphase ("no attachment") or
abnormally separate chromosomes if cells had already reached
near metaphase when they were exposed to VR23 (triple and
multiple MTOCs and skewed pull). Approximately 70% of cells
showed "no attachment" phenotype: their chromosomes are
either not completely condensed or not yet aligned at the equatorial plate. These data are consistent with that of Supplementary
Fig. S2C (co-immunoprecipitation data).
As cyclin E positively regulates centrosome duplication (2, 39),
we examined its centrosomal localization in early S-phase. We
found that cyclin E was not localized to the centrosome during the
ﬁrst 2 hours after double thymidine, regardless of VR23 treatment
(Fig. 3, 1–2 h after double thymidine). By 3 hours after double
thymidine, however, cyclin E was localized to centrosomes in the
presence (but not absence) of VR23. Unlike in HeLa cells, cyclin E
was not localized to the centrosome in MCF10A regardless VR23
treatment (Fig. 3). Our data thus demonstrate that cyclin E and its
localization to the centrosome may be responsible for centrosome
ampliﬁcation in cells exposed to VR23. To further conﬁrm this, we
examined centrosome ampliﬁcation in cells whose cyclin E had
been ablated with siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4, cyclin E ablation
indeed resulted in the complete abrogation of VR23-induced
centrosome ampliﬁcation, although DNA replication still
occurred (Fig. 4C). Together, our data demonstrate that cyclin
E plays a critical role for abnormal centrosome ampliﬁcation in
cancer cells exposed to VR23.
Ubiquitinated cyclin E accumulates at centrosomes in response
to VR23
As cyclin E is ubiquitinated in the process of degradation, we
examined its ubiquitination status in cells exposed to VR23. As
shown in Fig. 5A, centrosomally localized cyclin E is ubiquitinated in the presence of VR23 (inset box). Cyclin E ubiquitination
was further conﬁrmed by immunoprecipitation and subsequent
Western blotting (Fig. 5B). Together, our data demonstrate that
centrosomally localized cyclin E is ubiquitinated but not degraded in the presence of VR23. As this is directly correlated with
centrosome ampliﬁcation, we conclude that the high level of
ubiquitinated cyclin E and its localization to the centrosome
results in centrosome ampliﬁcation. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that VR23 causes neither ubiquitination nor
centrosomal localization of cyclin E in MCF10A (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, cyclin E is readily ubiquitinated in response to bortezomib in both cancer and noncancer
cells (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S4).
VR23 shows effective antitumor and antiangiogenic activities in
mice
We examined the antitumor activity of VR23 using ATH490
athymic mice engrafted with cancer cells as described in
Materials and Methods. The treatment of VR23 (30 mg/kg
body weight, i.p.) twice per week for 3 weeks resulted in a
4.6-fold decrease in MDA-MB-231 tumor size, compared with

Anticancer Property of VR23 Proteasome Inhibitor

Localization of cyclin E to centrosomes correlates with centrosome ampliﬁcation. Cells arrested at G1–S by double thymidine (DT) were released into cell

the control (305.01 vs. 65.88 mm3; Fig. 6A and B). When
animals were treated with 20 mg of paclitaxel and 30 mg of
VR23 per week for 3 weeks, the tumor size was reduced by 29fold (305.01 vs. 10.51 mm3; Fig. 6B, day 22). In this case, the
tumor size shrank to approximately one-ﬁfth of the original
size (50.69 vs. 10.51 mm3). As expected, data from a Ki-67
uptake assay carried out at 15 days after treatment showed that
VR23 substantially reduced cancer cell proliferation (Fig. 6C).
To examine VR23 antitumor activity on other cancers, we
treated ATH490 mice (n ¼ 4) engrafted with RPMI 8226 multiple
myeloma cells. We found that the tumor volume of VR23-treated
samples at 24 days after treatment was 19.1% of the control
(Supplementary Fig. S5; 1,219.5 vs. 233.0); thus, the antitumor
activity of VR23 is not limited to metastatic breast cancer.
We next examined the invasion of tumor cells into surrounding
tissues in ATH490 mice engrafted with MDA-MB-231. As shown
in Fig. 6D, substantial invasion of tumor cells into surrounding
tissues (e.g., muscle) was observed in the controls (29 days

after treatment). In contrast, tumor samples isolated from
ATH490 mice treated with VR23 or paclitaxel did not show
any evidence of tumor inﬁltration into surrounding tissues (Fig.
6D). Next, we determined the level of VEGF and CD31 in tumor
samples at 15 days after treatment. As expected, the expression
of VEGF and CD31 were not notable in tumors treated with
either paclitaxel, VR23, or in combination (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S6A).
VR23 reduces adverse effects caused by paclitaxel
Treatment of ATH490 mice with VR23 (30 mg/kg), paclitaxel
(20 mg/kg), or a combination of the two did not cause any
notable ill-effects on animals, as determined by changes in body
weights (Supplementary Fig. S6B). We next determined the toxic
effects of VR23 and paclitaxel on the liver, spleen, kidney, and
lung. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S7, organ weights did not
change by the treatments, with one exception: the spleens of
animals treated with 20 mg/kg of paclitaxel were enlarged by

Ablation of cyclin E suppresses VR23-induced centrosome ampliﬁcation. A, HeLa cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or cyclin E siRNA (100 nmol) for 12
hours, followed by synchronization at G1–S. Cells were then released into complete medium for 3 hours in the absence or presence of VR23, followed by
immunostaining with antibodies speciﬁc for proteins indicated. B, Western blot data show that cyclin E was successfully ablated by siRNA (two independent siRNA
treatments are shown). C, cells ablated by cyclin E still replicated DNA as determined by an EdU uptake assay. Panels i–iv are untreated control, VR23-treated,

19.5% after 29 days of treatment. Although this is statistically not
signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.29), we consistently observed that paclitaxel
treatment resulted in slight enlargement of spleen. Interestingly,
spleen weight was not increased when animals were treated
with both paclitaxel and VR23 in combination (Supplementary
Fig. S7).
The ratio of serum ALT and AST is often used to determine liver
injuries (40). Unlike VR23, paclitaxel treatment resulted in substantially higher AST/ALT ratio (Supplementary Table S2). To
further examine the potential liver toxicity by paclitaxel, we
counted mitotic cells in liver tissues (e.g., Supplementary Fig.
S6C). Mice treated with VR23 (30 mg) showed similar liver
mitotic index with controls (Fig. 7A). In contrast, samples treated
with paclitaxel (20 mg) showed approximately 13 times more
mitotic cells, again suggesting that paclitaxel causes liver damage.
Intriguingly, the elevated level of mitotic index caused by paclitaxel was dramatically reduced when used in combination with
VR23 (Fig. 7A).

4170 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

We also found that VR23 did not cause any notable ill-effects on
spleen (Fig. 7B). In contrast, paclitaxel caused several distinct
abnormalities on spleen, including expanded germinal center, an
increase in white pulp component, high cellularity, and capsule
ﬁbrosis. Similarly, VR23 did not cause any abnormality in kidney,
while samples from paclitaxel-treated animals showed some
morphologic changes similar to that of glomerulonephritis (Fig.
7C). Intriguingly, the level of paclitaxel-induced high cellularity
was notably reduced when used in combination with VR23 (Fig.
7C). Taken together, our data from a serum AST/ALT test, the liver
mitotic index count, and spleen and kidney studies strongly
indicate that VR23 not only does not cause notable ill-effects but
also can substantially reduce adverse effects caused by paclitaxel.

Anticancer Property of VR23 Proteasome Inhibitor

have demonstrated that the primary target of VR23 is b2 of the S20
proteasome subunit, although chymotrypsin-like and caspaselike proteasome activities are also substantially inhibited. The
proteasome inhibitory function appears to be a key mechanism
how VR23 kills cells. An interesting point is that the combination
of the b2-targeting VR23 and the b5-targeting bortezomib show
strong synergistic effect (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the same combination also effectively kills BTZ-resistant multiple myeloma cells,
raising the possibility that targeting multiple proteasome subunits can not only be more effective but also overcome the
emergence of resistance to agents targeting single proteasome
subunits.
An important point is that VR23 preferentially kill cancer over
noncancer cells, mainly through the abnormal ampliﬁcation of
centrosomes in cancer but not in normal cells. Centrosome is
normally duplicated only once per cell cycle in close collaboration
with DNA replication and segregation (2, 41). However, cancer
cells treated with VR23 continues to amplify their centrosomes
even during G2–M, largely dissociating the centrosome regulation
from DNA replication/segregation. This, in turn, leads to complete disarray of the cell division process and, eventually cell death
by apoptosis.
In addition to its positive regulation for DNA replication, cyclin
E is required for centrosome (re)duplication (2, 39, 42). Overall,
our data are consistent with the idea that the failing of timely
degradation of cyclin E is one of the key mechanisms how the
centrosome is ampliﬁed in cells treated with VR23. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that, unlike in controls
or MG132-treated cells, cyclin E is localized to the ampliﬁed
centrosomes in cells treated with VR23 (Fig. 3). As expected,
cyclin E is largely ubiquitinated in the presence of VR23 (Fig.
5), indicating that the cyclin E degradation process is inhibited

www.aacrjournals.org

after the conjugation of ubiquitin molecules. The fact that the
knockdown of cyclin E with siRNA completely suppresses VR23induced centrosome ampliﬁcation supports the notion that cyclin
E plays a critical role in VR23-induced abnormal centrosome
ampliﬁcation (Fig. 4). Unlike in cancer cells, however, cyclin E
is neither highly ubiquitinated up to 40 mmol/L of VR23 (Supplementary Fig. S4) nor localizes to the centrosomes in MCF10A
(Fig. 3). This may be the major reason why VR23 neither induces
centrosome ampliﬁcation nor effectively kills noncancer cells. In
contrast, bortezomib strongly induces cyclin E ubiquitination in
both MCF10A and HeLa cells (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S4).
This may be relevant to the fact that bortezomib does not exhibit
selectivity for cancer over noncancer cells (43). We also found that
MG132, another proteasome inhibitor, does not cause centrosome ampliﬁcation (Fig. 5A). Thus, VR23 possesses a unique
property in inhibiting proteasome activity and amplifying centrosomes in a cancer-speciﬁc manner.
Multiple reduplication of the centrosome usually results in the
formation of a ﬂower-petal conﬁguration dubbed "rosette" (44).
However, we did not observe a rosette shape cluster of centrosomes in cells treated with VR23. Therefore, the centrosome
ampliﬁcation caused by VR23 is not likely by multiple reduplications. Instead, de novo centrosome synthesis could be the primary
mechanism of centrosome ampliﬁed in cancer cells exposed to
VR23, as multiple centrosomes are often found throughout the
cytoplasm as previously described for de novo centrosome synthesis (10). In this context, it is possible that the VR23-caused
accumulation of (extremely bulky) ubiquitinated cyclin E molecules at discrete cytoplasmic sites can be the nidus to attract other
proteins involving in centrosome synthesis (such as plk1, SAS6,
centrin, and g-tubulin), eventually leading to centrosome synthesis by a de novo assembly mechanism. Together, our data from

VR23 shows anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities. A, ATH490 athymic mice engrafted with MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells were treated
with VR23 alone or in combination with paclitaxel (Tax). "Tax, VR23" denotes that animals were treated with paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) 24 hours prior to the
treatment of VR23 (30 mg/kg) once per week. B, the changes in tumor sizes in response to drug treatment are shown. N ¼ 4 per group. C, VR23 inhibits tumor
cell proliferation in vivo. Tumor samples were taken 15 days after ATH490 mice were treated as in A, followed by immunostaining with an anti-Ki-67
antibody. The samples were counterstained with hematoxylin. Pictures were taken with a Zeiss EPI-ﬂuorescent microscope using a 10 objective. D, VR23
inhibits angiogenesis and spreading of tumor cells to surrounding tissues. Tissue samples were either stained with H&E or immunostained with an antibody speciﬁc

in vitro studies support a model where de novo centrosome ampliﬁcation by VR23 leads to mitotic abnormality including the lack
of coordinated microtubule attachment to the kinetochore, chromosome breakage, and cell-cycle arrest at prometaphase, resulting
in cell death by apoptosis.
When we screened our chemical library to identify potential
anticancer agents, the most important criterion was selecting
compounds that preferentially kill cancer over noncancer cells,
on the assumption that this can be relevant to differential cancer
cell killing in vivo. We found that compounds with IC50 values of a
nanomolar range usually do not show selectivity for cancer cell
killing, while those with a micromolar range are often selective.
The reason for this may be that highly active compounds target
critical survival pathways shared by both cancer and normal cells,
while some of the less potent compounds may target pathways

4172 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

that are more speciﬁc to cancer cell survival. Our in vitro study
showed that VR23 kills cells in a cancer-speciﬁc manner (Fig. 1),
which was the main reason why we carried out in-depth in vitro
and, subsequently, in vivo studies with VR23.
VR23 indeed shows substantial antitumor activity on both
metastatic breast cancer (engrafted with MDA-MB-231) and RPMI
8226 multiple myeloma xenograft models. Furthermore, when
used in combination, VR23 substantially increases the efﬁcacy of
paclitaxel. For example, paclitaxel alone could reduce tumor
burden by 18.4-fold (i.e., 305.01 vs. 16.59 in Fig. 6B), while the
combination of paclitaxel and VR23 could reduce the tumor
burden by 29-fold (i.e., 305.01 vs. 10.51 in Fig. 6B). The advantage of VR23 as an anticancer agent is that it is not only nontoxic to
animals but also can reduce toxicity caused by paclitaxel (and
possibly other drugs). The examination of four vital organs (liver,

VR23 reduces toxicity caused by paclitaxel. A, data from microscopy show that VR23 reduces mitotic index. Samples were taken at 29 days after treatment
with 30 mg/kg VR23, 20 mg/kg paclitaxel (Tax), or combination of the two. At least 10 ﬁelds for each slide (one slide per mouse and 6 mice per group) were
examined. P < 0.0001. B, VR23 does not cause any notable toxicity to spleen. GC, germinal center; white arrows show the presence of macrophages in the

spleen, kidney, and lung) revealed that VR23 does not cause any
visible morphologic changes in the organs examined. In contrast,
paclitaxel at 20 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks caused a slight increase in
spleen size and a substantial increase in liver mitotic index, while
VR23 did not. Importantly, the liver mitotic index of animals
treated with paclitaxel was dramatically reduced when used in
combination with VR23. Furthermore, the AST/ALT ratio of VR23treated mice is indistinguishable from that of the untreated
control, while that of paclitaxel-treated animals was elevated by
1.5-fold (1.60 vs. 2.36; Supplementary Table S2). As paclitaxel can
induce substantial hepatobiliary side effects in human (45), our
data raise the possibility that VR23 may reduce paclitaxel-induced
hepatobiliary in human.
Paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) caused a number of adverse effects on
spleen, including the expansion of the germinal center and the
hyperplasia of myeloid and lymphoid cells, none of which was
shown in the mice treated with VR23. Similarly, VR23 did not
cause any notable abnormality in the kidney (Fig. 7C). In contrast,
kidneys from paclitaxel-treated mice showed increased glomeru-

lar cellularity and contracted Bowman's space, reminiscent of the
changes seen in endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis.
Importantly, the paclitaxel-induced cellularity was substantially
reduced when used in combination with VR23. As paclitaxel can
cause renal failure in a certain subgroup of patients (45), our data
raise the possibility that VR23 can be used along with paclitaxel to
reduce renal toxicity. Thus, the potential of VR23 for combinational therapies is extremely promising, although it can certainly
be used as a single anticancer agent.
