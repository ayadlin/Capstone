Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

Accurate chromosome segregation requires timely dissolution of chromosome cohesion after
chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. Separase is absolutely essential for
12
cohesion dissolution in organisms from yeast to man , . It cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin
and opens the cohesin ring to allow chromosome segregation. Cohesin cleavage is
spatiotemporally controlled by separase-associated regulatory proteins, including the inhibitory
3 6
7 12
chaperone securin – , and by phosphorylation of both the enzyme and substrates – .
Dysregulation of this process causes chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy, contributing to
cancer and birth defects. Despite its essential functions, atomic structures of separase have not
been determined. Here, we report crystal structures of the separase protease domain from
Chaetomium thermophilum, alone or covalently bound to unphosphorylated and phosphorylated
inhibitory peptides derived from a cohesin cleavage site. These structures reveal how separase
recognizes cohesin and how cohesin phosphorylation by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) enhances
13
cleavage. Consistent with a previous cellular study , mutating two securin residues in a conserved
motif that partially matches the separase cleavage consensus converts securin from a separase
inhibitor to a substrate. Our study establishes atomic mechanisms of substrate cleavage by
separase and suggests competitive inhibition by securin.

Separase belongs to the clan CD family of cysteine proteases that includes caspases . It
contains a large N-terminal armadillo (ARM) repeat domain and a highly conserved Cterminal separase protease domain (SPD) that consists of a pseudo protease domain (PPD)
14
and an active protease domain (APD) (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1). Cohesin forms

an asymmetric ring to topologically entrap chromosomes (Fig. 1a) , . Separase cleaves the
kleisin subunit to open the cohesin ring and trigger chromosome segregation. It also cleaves

discovery, hindering our understanding of its mechanism and regulation.

We found that SPD of Chaetomium thermophilum (ct) separase could be expressed in large
quantities in bacteria without securin (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Recombinant ctSPD, but not
the C2110S mutant, cleaved ctScc1 to produce two major fragments (Extended Data Fig.
2
2b). Separase is known to cleave after the EXXR (X, any residue) consensus motif . Chargereversal mutation of the 212EVGR215 motif in ctScc1 reduced cleavage by separase (Fig.
1b,c). An acyloxymethyl ketone (AMK)-containing peptide inhibitor derived from this
cleavage site blocked ctScc1 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig.
2c,d), and retarded the gel mobility of ctSPDWT, but not ctSPDC2110S, consistent with
6
covalent inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Similar to separases from other species , longer
constructs of ctSPD containing an N-terminal extension underwent cleavage at
the 1643ELAR1646 site (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2f). Thus, recombinant ctSPD was
active.

We determined the crystal structure of ctSPD (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Table 1). It forms
one globular domain with two sub-domains—the pseudo protease domain (PPD) and the
active protease domain (APD)—that pack against each other. APD has an overall fold
similar to that of caspases (Fig. 1d,e, and Extended Data Fig. 3, 4a). PPD also has a mixed
α/β fold, but its central β-sheet has a topology different from that of caspases. One edge of
this central sheet of PPD forms an edge-on interaction with that of APD, whereas the other
edge is capped by a helical domain in PPD. A prominent helical insert (HI) of PPD forms a
long coiled-coil and packs against APD.

The catalytic dyad H2083 and C2110 are located in loops L3 and L4 of APD (Fig. 1d and
Extended Data Fig. 3a). An important mechanism of pro-caspase activation is the
reorganization of L4, which can be achieved through homo-dimerization, cleavage of an
19 22
internal linker, or both – . The geometry of the catalytic dyad and the extended
conformation of L4 in ctSPD are similar to those in active caspase 9 (Fig. 1d,e), consistent
with ctSPD being an active enzyme. Thus, separase activation does not require proteolytic
cleavage of L4. Consistent with the importance of the L4 loop, mutations of two residues
adjacent to C2110, M2108 and S2112, reduced the activity of ctSPD (Fig. 2a,b and
Extended Data Fig. 4b). In contrast, mutations of L4 residues distal to C2110, including
E2120 and F2121, enhanced the activity of ctSPD.
A segment of the N-terminal tag of recombinant ctSPD binds to a conserved surface pocket
in PPD adjacent to L4 (Figs. 1d, 2c, and Extended Data Fig. 4c). Although this tag is not
required for the activity of ctSPD, mutations targeting residues in the tag-binding pocket
altered the activity of ctSPD containing the tag (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4d). Similar
to mutations of the distal L4 residues, the D1698K and D1960K mutations enhanced the
activity of ctSPD. We propose that securin or other regions of separase may bind to this tagbinding site, alter the conformation of L4, and affect the protease activity of separase. Even
without bona fide ligands, binding of an artificial tag to this site can regulate the protease
activity of ctSPD in a subtle way.

Unlike active caspase 9, which forms a homodimer , separase contains an internal PPD in
the same polypeptide chain that packs against and stabilizes its APD. In particular, the
helical insert (HI) of PPD makes extensive contacts with APD and bridges the two subdomains (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Deletion of HI or mutations of key residues at the HI–
APD interface, including D1805 and W2143, abolished the expression of soluble ctSPD in
bacteria (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5a,c). Several HI residues, including C1782 and
H1783, are located close to the active site (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Mutations of these
residues did not affect the solubility of ctSPD, but reduced the protease activity (Extended
Data Fig. 5d). Moreover, residues from the tip of HI, along with residues from APD, form a
basic pocket that binds a citrate molecule (Fig. 2f). Mutations of these conserved residues,
with the exception of R1794E, diminished separase activity (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig.
1). Therefore, HI is critical for both the structure integrity and activity of separase.

Phosphorylation of Scc1 by Plk1 enhances Scc1 cleavage by separase , . This cleavageenhancing phosphorylation is opposed by the shugoshin–PP2A complex bound to
23 27
cohesin – . Incubation of ctScc1, but not ctScc1 S210A, with human Plk1 (hsPlk1)
enhanced the cleavage of ctScc1 by ctSPD (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Addition of the hsPlk1
inhibitor BI2536 blocked this enhancement. The phospho-mimicking S210E mutation
stimulated ctScc1 cleavage by separase (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Thus, Plk1-dependent
phosphorylation of ctScc1 at S210 enhances Scc1 cleavage by separase.

We next determined the crystal structures of ctSPD bound to unphosphorylated (AMK) or
phospho-S210-containing (pAMK) inhibitors (Extended Data Table 1). The overall structure
of ctSPD–AMK and ctSPD–pAMK complexes is virtually identical to that of free ctSPD,
indicating that substrate binding does not induce notable conformational changes. Only the
C-terminal 212EVGR215 segment of the unphosphorylated AMK inhibitor was visible
(Extended Data Fig. 6c), whereas all residues of the pAMK inhibitor had clearly defined
electron density (Fig. 3a). In both structures, the active-site cysteine C2110 is covalently
linked to ctScc1 R215 at the P1 position. Consistent with its role in stabilizing the oxyanion
during catalysis, ctSPD H2083 of the catalytic dyad is located close to carbonyl group of
ctScc1 R215. R215 forms a salt bridge with ctSPD D2151 at the base of a deep, acidic S1
pocket (Fig. 3b,c). ctScc1 E212 at P4 inserts into the aforementioned citrate-binding pocket,
forming favorable electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 3b and Extended
Data Fig. 6d). ctScc1 V213 and G214 form minimal contacts with ctSPD. Mutations of
residues lining the S1 and S4 pockets in ctSPD greatly diminished separase activity (Fig.
3d).
The S1 pocket mutant D2151A of ctSPD cleaved ctScc1 at a different site (Fig. 3d). The
ctScc1 E180K mutation abolished this aberrant cleavage (Extended Data Fig. 6e), indicating
that the mutant separase cleaved the 180ELGM183 site. Thus, D2151 not only selects for
basic residues but also discriminates against hydrophobic residues at P1. ctSPD charge
reversal mutants D2151R and R2152E did not efficiently cleave the complementary charge
reversal mutants of ctScc1 (Extended Data Fig. 6f), indicating that other residues in the S1
and S4 pockets contribute to substrate recognition. Because most residues lining the S1 and
S4 pockets are conserved among separases in all species (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 7), our
analyses establish the basis for the EXXR substrate specificity of separase.

Phosphorylation of the substrate does not alter the binding mode of EVGR at P1–P4, but
reveals or establishes additional contacts at P5 and P6. I211 at the P5 position packs against
W1797 of HI (Fig. 3e). ctScc1 I211A was less efficiently cleaved by ctSPD with or without
28
Plk1 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Thus, as reported previously , the hydrophobic residue at P5
contributes to substrate specificity. Phospho-S210 at P6 makes favorable electrostatic
interactions with R1794 of HI and R2148 of APD in ctSPD (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig.
8b). Single mutation of R1794 or R2148 reduced the stimulation of Scc1 cleavage by Plk1,
whereas the double mutation abolished the effect (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 8c,d).
Unlike R2148A, R1794E does not affect the cleavage of unphosphorylated Scc1. Therefore,
R1794 specifically serves as a receptor for pS210. R2148 contributes to the recognition of
both pS210 and E212. The serine at P6 is conserved in fungal Scc1 and other separase
substrates (Fig. 1b). The N-terminal separase cleavage site in vertebrate Scc1 contains a
phospho-mimicking, acidic residue at that position. Our structures thus explain the
phosphorylation dependency of cohesin cleavage, and further suggest that this phosphoregulation might apply to other separase substrates.

Finally, we probed the mechanism by which securin inhibits separase. Securin blocks
36
substrate access to the active site of separase , . Expectedly, the ctSecurin–ctSeparase
complex was less active in ctScc1 cleavage, as compared to ctSPD (Extended Data Fig.
9a,b). A conserved EVE motif in securin matches the separase cleavage consensus at
positions P2–P6, but lacks the arginine at P1 and often has a proline at P0 instead of a
hydrophilic residue (Fig. 4a). A securin mutant with three residues in this motif mutated was
13
cleaved by separase in fission yeast cells . We thus mutated P164 and P165 in ctSecurin to
R and D, the matching ctScc1 residues at P1 and P0. The resulting ctSecurinRD mutant was
efficiently cleaved by ctSPD, and this cleavage was inhibited by the AMK inhibitor (Fig.
4b). Mutating the phospho-serine-binding residues in ctSPD or E159 in ctSecurinRD reduced
cleavage (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9c), indicating that this artificial substrate bound at
the canonical substrate-binding sites of separase. ctSecurin bound tightly to the N-terminal
ARM domain of ctSeparase (Extended Data Fig. 9d). A synthetic EVE-containing securin
peptide did not inhibit ctSPD (Extended Data Fig. 9e). We propose that securin acts as a
pseudo-substrate to competitively block substrate binding to separase (Fig. 4d). Securin
binding to the ARM domain of separase provides the necessary avidity for securin to
outcompete authentic substrates for access to the active site. Securin is not cleaved because
of incompatible residues at the site of cleavage.
As a crucial protease that triggers chromosome segregation, separase is a potential
29
oncoprotein . Because of the conserved principles of substrate recognition (Extended Data
Fig. 7), our structure of an active fungal separase can guide the rational design of chemical
inhibitors of human separase, which may have therapeutic potential.

ctSPD1632–2223 was subcloned into a modified pET bacterial expression vector. The pETctSPD vector encoded ctSPD1632–2223 with an N-terminal His6 tag of the following
sequence: MGSSHHHHHHSQLEVLFQGPLGSGRP. The pET-ctSPD vector was
transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Protein expression was induced with
isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) at 18°C for overnight. The bacteria were harvested and
resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1
mM DTT, and 0.05% Triton X-100). After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant
was applied to Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen). After extensive washing, His6-ctSPD was eluted
from the Ni2+-NTA column. His6-ctSPD was further purified with a mono Q 5/50 GL anionexchange column (GE Healthcare) and a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column. The point
mutants of ctSPD were generated with the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed
Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The truncated variants and point mutants of ctSPD
were expressed and purified similarly. Because ctSPD1632–2223 underwent autocleavage at
the 1643ELAR1646 site, we generated a noncleavable (NC) 1643RLAE1646 mutant to prevent
autocleavage and increase yield. All ctSPDs in this study, except that in Extended Data Fig.
2b, contained the NC mutation.

The selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled ctSPD1663–2223 was produced with the methionine
31
biosynthesis inhibition method . Briefly, bacteria transformed with pET-ctSPD cultured
overnight were pelleted, washed, and resuspended with M9 minimal media. The bacteria
were further incubated at 37°C until the OD600 reaches about 1.0. Methionine biosynthesis
was inhibited by the addition of the amino acids solution containing 50 mg/l of Leu/Ile/Val
and 100 mg/l of Phe/Lys/Thr/SeMet. Protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM ITPG at
18°C for overnight. The SeMet-labeled protein was subsequently purified through the same
procedure as described above.

The ctSecurin cDNA (GenBank ID: 18256826) was cloned from a cDNA library of
Chaetomium thermophilum. The cDNAs of ctSeparase and ctSecurin were separately
subcloned into a modified pFastBac HT vector (Invitrogen). The final constructs encoded an
N-terminal His6-Strep-tagged ctSeparase and an N-terminal His6-tagged ctSecurin.
Baculoviruses of ctSeparase and ctSecurin were constructed with the Bac-to-Bac system
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Sf9 cells were co-infected with
ctSeparase and ctSecurin baculoviruses and harvested at 48 h post-infection. Cells were
resuspended in the lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5%
glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.05% Triton X-100, followed by sonication and centrifugation.
The supernatant was applied onto a Strep-Tactin Superflow column (Qiagen). After
extensive washes with the lysis buffer, the ctSeparase–Securin complex was eluted with the
elution buffer containing 5 mM d-Desthiobiotin (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. The His6-ctSPD1501–2223 protein was
expressed in Sf9 cells with a similar strategy and purified through a Ni2+-NTA column.

ctScc1 or its mutants, the pCS2-ctScc1 plasmids were added to the TNT Quick Coupled
Transcription Translation System (Promega) and incubated in the presence of 35Smethionine at 30°C for 90 min. (The 35S-ctScc1 proteins migrated as a doublet on SDSPAGE, possibly due to proteolysis or internal methionine initiation during the in vitro
translation reaction.) Then, 2 μl of 35S-ctScc1 was added to 18 μl of ctSPD (~1.5 μM) or
ctSeparase–Securin protein solution containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 75 mM KCl, 5
mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 15 mM NaF, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100,
and incubated at 30°C for 60 min. For assays in Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2b, a higher
concentration of ctSPD (3.0 μM) was used, resulting in more complete ctScc1 cleavage. For
AMK inhibition assay, ctSPD was pre-incubated with the ctScc1-AMK inhibitor
(synthesized by KareBay Biochem, Inc) at room temperature for 30 min and further
incubated with 35S-ctScc1 at 30°C for 60 min. In the Plk1 stimulation assay, 35S-ctScc1 was
pre-treated with recombinant GST-hsPlk1T210D in the kinase buffer for 30 min at 30°C, in
the absence or presence of 10 μM BI2536, and further incubated with ctSPD (0.5 μM) for 60
min. The reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, which were stained,
destained, dried, and analyzed with Fuji or GE phosphoimagers.

The ctSecurin WT and P164R/P165D (ctSecurinRD) cDNAs were subcloned into pCS2-Myc
vector with a SP6 promoter. The 35S-labeled ctSecurinWT and ctSecurinRD proteins was
produced and assayed as described above. The ctSecurin153–177
(DPLQVEEVEYAPPKPKEMPYESDVF) and ctSecurin153–177 3A
(DPLQVEAAAYAPPKPKEMPYESDVF) peptides were chemically synthesized and tested
for their ability to inhibit the cleavage of ctScc1 by ctSPD as described above.
Crystallization and data collection
All crystallization experiments were carried out at 20°C. Initial screens were performed with
a Phoenix crystallization robot (Art Robbins Instruments), using the commercially available
screening kits from Hampton Research, Qiagen, and Molecular Dimensions. Conditions
obtained from the initial screens were optimized using hanging-drop vapor diffusion
method. Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained by repeated microseeding. All crystals
were cryoprotected with a reservoir solution supplemented with 15% glycerol.

Both native and SeMet-labeled ctSPD1663–2223 crystals were grown by mixing equal
volumes of the protein solution (11 mg/ml) with the precipitant solution containing 0.2 M
ammonium citrate tribasic (pH 7.0), 20% PEG3350, and 10 mM DTT. Diffraction data were
collected at beamline BL8.2.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National
32

For crystallization of ctSPD1632–2223–AMK and ctSPD1693–2223–pAMK complexes, the
purified ctSPD proteins were mixed with the ctScc1-AMK or phospho-ctScc1-AMK peptide
inhibitors (KareBay Biochem) at a molar ratio of 1:2.5, and incubated overnight at room
temperature to form covalent complexes as monitored by SDS-PAGE. The complexes were
further purified with a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion column in the buffer
containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT. Crystals of
ctSPD1632–2223–AMK were grown by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution (13

The crystal of SeMet-labeled ctSPD1663–2223 diffracted to a minimum Bragg’s spacing of
2.20 Å and exhibited the symmetry of the space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a =
55.67 Å, b = 98.79 Å, c = 107.76 Å. Phases were obtained from the selenium single
anomalous dispersion (SAD) method. With data truncated to 2.5 Å, 9 of 10 possible
33
selenium sites were located and refined with PHENIX AutoSol , resulting in an overall
figure of merit of 0.323. The experimental electron density map was used to construct an
initial model with automated building with PHENIX AutoBuild. As a result, 414 of total 587
residues were built in the initial model, with Rwork and Rfree of 27.74% and 32.79%,
34
respectively. Iterative model building and refinement were carried out with JLigand ,
35
COOT and PHENIX, respectively. Phases of native ctSPD1663–2223, ctSPD1632–2223–
