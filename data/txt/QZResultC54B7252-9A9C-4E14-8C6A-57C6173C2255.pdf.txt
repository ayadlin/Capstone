Abstract
Signaling through the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor
(IGF-IR) is implicated in cellular proliferation, apoptosis,
carcinogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to cytotoxic cancer
therapies. Targeted disruption of IGF-IR signaling combined
with cytotoxic therapy may therefore yield improved anticancer efficacy over conventional treatments alone. In this
study, a fully human anti–IGF-IR monoclonal antibody A12
(ImClone Systems, Inc., New York, NY) is examined as an adjunct
to radiation therapy. IGF-IR expression is shown for a diverse
cohort of cell lines, whereas targeted IGF-IR blockade by A12
inhibits IGF-IR phosphorylation and activation of the downstream effectors Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase.
Anchorage-dependent proliferation and xenograft growth is
inhibited by A12 in a dose-dependent manner, particularly for
non–small cell lung cancer lines. Clonogenic radiation
survival of H226 and H460 cells grown under anchoragedependent conditions is impaired by A12, demonstrating a
radiation dose-enhancing effect for IGF-IR blockade. Postradiation anchorage-independent colony formation is
inhibited by A12 in A549 and H460 cells. In the H460 xenograft
model, combining A12 and radiation significantly enhances
antitumor efficacy compared with either modality alone.
These effects may be mediated by promotion of radiationinduced, double-stranded DNA damage and apoptosis as
observed in cell culture. In summary, these results validate
IGF-IR signal transduction blockade as a promising strategy to
improve radiation therapy efficacy in human tumors, forming
a basis for future clinical trials. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1155–62]

Introduction
A protein of significant interest in cancer therapeutics is the
insulin-like growth factor receptor-I (IGF-IR), a membrane-bound
tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a role in tumor cell proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, and metastasis (1, 2). Overexpression of
IGF-IR or the soluble ligands IGF-I and IGF-II is shown in a broad
spectrum of malignancies arising from breast (3, 4), prostate (5, 6),
colon (7), lung (8), melanoma (9), ovary (10), and myeloid origin
(11). Epidemiologic studies also reveal a link between elevated
serum IGF-I and IGF-II levels and an increased incidence of breast,
prostate, and colon cancer (12). Furthermore, IGF-IR signaling is

known to mediate resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and
radiation, raising the possibility that targeted disruption of the
IGF-IR axis may afford a therapeutic advantage when combined
with either of these conventional cancer treatments (13–15).
The development of clinically useful methods to inhibit IGF-IR
signaling has been hindered by cross-reactivity with the insulin
receptor. Methods including mouse monoclonal antibodies,
antisense strategies, receptor inhibitor peptides, and dominantnegative constructs show antiproliferative efficacy in preclinical
model systems but are not easily translated into clinical use
(16–20). Recently, IGF-IR–specific, small-molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors and humanized or fully human monoclonal IGF-IR
antibodies have been developed, enabling preclinical testing with
the potential for clinical use (21–26). The fully human monoclonal
antibody A12 (ImClone Systems, Inc., New York, NY) was developed
by screening a human Fab phage display library to yield a highaffinity monoclonal antibody (4.11  10 11 mol/L, IC50 0.6–1
nmol/L) that inhibits IGF-IR activation and signaling through the
downstream effector mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase/Akt pathways without significant
insulin receptor cross-reactivity (21). Preclinical testing of A12 in
human cancer cells results in apoptosis induction by two distinct
mechanisms: first, by blocking the interaction of IGF-IR and its
ligands and, second, by mediating IGF-IR internalization and
degradation (21).
Promotion of apoptosis is one mechanism by which inhibition of
growth factor signaling may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of
radiation, as suggested by preclinical studies of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR; refs. 27, 28). Combining EGFR
inhibition with radiation has recently shown potent survival benefit
in a phase III clinical trial (29). Given the involvement of IGF-IR in
diverse oncologic processes, including apoptosis, we hypothesized
that targeted IGF-IR signaling inhibition might similarly enhance
the efficacy of radiation in tumors where IGF-IR activation is a
component of the cancer phenotype. We therefore did studies to
identify cell lines in which IGF-IR signaling inhibition results in
proliferation inhibition. The interaction between A12 and radiation
was subsequently characterized in these lines, demonstrating
enhancement of radiation-induced apoptosis, clonogenic survival,
and xenograft growth inhibition for tumor cells exposed to A12 and
radiation. These results suggest that interruption of IGF-IR
signaling may be a therapeutically useful adjunct to radiation
therapy.

purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Cell lines and cell culture. UM-SCC-1 and UM-SCC-6 cells were
provided by Dr. Thomas E. Carey (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI).
SCC-1483 cells were provided by Dr. Jennifer Grandis (University of
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). A431, MCF-7, SKBr3, DU145, PC3, LNCaP, T98G,
A549, and H460 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). A431, SCC-1, SCC-6, and SCC-1483 cells were
cultured in DMEM with 1% hydrocortisone. A549, BxPC3, H226, H460,
DU145, PC3, LNCaP, and T98G cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with
L-glutamine. The medium was supplemented with 10% FCS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin unless otherwise indicated.
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed with Tween 20 lysis buffer [50 nmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 nmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 2.5 nmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and 10 Ag/mL leupeptin and aprotinin] and lysed with a 27-gauge
needle. Protein concentration was quantified with a modified Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of protein were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes and analyzed with primary antibodies against IGF-IRh, total
IGF-IR, phospho-Akt, total Akt, phospho-MAPK, total MAPK, or a-tubulin.
Proteins were detected by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+)
detection system (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL).
IGF-IR immunoprecipitation. Cells were exposed in serum-free
medium overnight and incubated with human IgG for 1 h (negative
control), 100 nmol/L A12 for 1 h (negative control), 50 ng/mL IGF-I for 30
min (positive control), or 100 nmol/L A12 for 1 h followed by IGF-I for 30
min (experimental). Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, and total cellular
protein was harvested as described above. IGF-IR was immunoprecipitated
from 1 mg total cellular protein by overnight incubation with 2 Ag (10 AL)
anti–IGF-IRh antibody (C-20). Antibody-protein complexes were precipitated with 20 AL protein A+G agarose beads for 2 h at 4jC on a rocker plate.
Beads were resuspended in electrophoresis buffer and boiled for 2 min to
solubilize and denature precipitated protein. Proteins were separated by
SDS-PAGE, and phospho–IGF-IR was detected with anti–phospho-tyrosine
antibody.
Growth inhibition assay. The antiproliferative effect of A12 on various
cell lines was determined using a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells in exponential growth were
seeded on 96-well plates and incubated in complete growth medium overnight to allow establishment of cell monolayers. Cells were generally seeded
at a density that would yield 80% confluence by the completion of the
experiment, varying by cell line from 500 to 2,500 per well. After 24 h,
complete medium was removed from the wells and replaced with medium
containing either A12 (experimental) or human IgG (control) in a range
between 0 and 1,000 nmol/L with six replicates per condition. After exposure to IgG or A12 for 48 to 72 h, MTT (1 mg/mL) was added to each well for
2 h at 37jC to allow the conversion of MTT to dark blue formazan crystals
in viable cells. The formazan crystals were solubilized overnight at 37jC in
a solution containing 10% SDS and 50% N,N-dimethylformamide. The absorbance of each well was measured in a microplate reader at 610 nm. A proliferative index was calculated by dividing the average absorbance for each
experimental condition by the untreated control cell average absorbance.

Apoptosis assays. To assess the activation of effector caspases, a
sulforhodamine-labeled fluoromethyl ketone peptide inhibitor of caspase
(SR-VAD-FMK) assay was done using the CaspaTag assay (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA). Attached and floating cells were then harvested and exposed
to SR-VAD-FMK at 37jC for 1 h. After washing out membrane-bound
fluorophore, aliquots were assayed on a fluorescence plate reader at
550 nm/595 nm (excitation/emission). The downstream apoptosis effector
molecule Bax was assayed by immunoblotting of total cellular lysates. Cells
were grown either in the presence or absence of A12 for 24 h with 1%
serum. Cells in the experimental groups were irradiated (8 Gy) and cultured
for 48 h before protein harvest.
Clonogenic radiation survival assay. Survival after radiation exposure
was defined as the ability of the cells to maintain their clonogenic capacity
by forming colonies after radiation exposure. Cells were exposed to either
A12 or human IgG for 48 to 72 h and subsequently irradiated at 0 to 5 Gy
with a Shepherd & Associates Model 109 irradiator (San Fernando, CA) and
a cesium-137 source. Cells were then trypsinized, counted, and seeded for
colony formation in six-well plates at 50 to 5,000 per well. Cells were
incubated from 7 to 21 days with medium changes every 48 to 72 h. At the
end of the experiment, colonies were stained with crystal violet and
manually counted. Colonies consisting of 50 or more cells were scored, and
4 to 10 replicate wells containing 10 to 150 colonies per well were counted
for each condition.
Soft agar colony formation assay. Soft agar colony-forming assays
were done with modifications to a previously described protocol (30).
Agarose (0.5%) was prepared in complete RPMI medium and allowed to
solidify as the bottom layer in 24- or 6-well plates. Exponentially growing
cells were harvested and incubated in 100 AL PBS containing various A12 or
human IgG concentrations for 15 min before embedding in a 0.35% top
agarose layer with complete RPMI medium and three to five replicates per
condition. Plates were incubated for 15 to 30 min at room temperature to
allow the top layer to solidify. To allow cells to recover, plates were
incubated for 12 h at 37jC before irradiation and subsequently returned to
the incubator for 7 to 14 days. At the conclusion of the experiment, colonies
were visualized after exposure to MTT for 1 to 2 h at 37jC. Plates were
digitized with a computer-based scanner and colonies were manually
counted for quantification.
Detection of double-stranded DNA damage. Cells were seeded at
3,000 per well on four-well culture coated slides (Nalge Nunc Intl.,
Rochester, NY) and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were subsequently
exposed to A12 (100 nmol/L) or IGF-I (50 ng/mL) in 1% serum for
48 h followed by 6 Gy irradiation. Cells were fixed in methanol/5% acetic
acid at 6 and 24 h postirradiation followed by processing for gH2AX
immunocytochemistry and DAPI nuclear staining. Nonspecific antigen
sites were blocked for 30 min in 3% bovine serum albumin. Anti–phosphohistone H2A.X antibody (1:450) was applied for 1 h at room temperature.
After washing, AlexaFluor488–conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used
to label the primary antibody, and DAPI staining was done. Cells were
mounted in ProLong Antifade medium and visualized with a 40
objective using an Olympus BX51 fluorescent microscope (Olympus
America, Inc., Melville, NY) and photographed with a SPOT RT color
charge coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling
Heights, MI).
Xenograft growth in athymic nude mice. Athymic nude mice (3- to 4week-old females) were obtained from Harlan Bioproducts for Science
(Indianapolis, IN) and maintained in a laminar airflow cabinet under
aseptic conditions. The care and treatment of experimental animals was in
accordance with institutional guidelines. Approximately 1  106 cells were
injected s.c. into the flank area (two tumors per animal) on day 0. Tumor
volume was determined by direct measurement with calipers and
calculated by the formula p/6  (large diameter)  (small diameter)2.
Animal experiments generally included four treatment groups: control,
radiation alone, A12 alone, and radiation in combination with A12. A12 was
administered by i.p. injection at the specified doses and intervals. Radiation
treatment was delivered via precision photon beam from a Varian (Palo
Alto, CA) orthovoltage machine using custom-designed mouse jigs that
immobilized the animals and specifically exposed the dorsal flank

(harboring tumor xenografts) for irradiation without exposing non–tumorbearing normal tissues.
Immmunohistochemistry. IGF-IRh, PCNA, and a-tubulin expressions
were detected in xenograft histologic sections using immunohistochemistry.
At xenograft harvest, animals were euthanized and tumor specimens were
excised and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. After embedding in
paraffin, 5-Am tissue sections were cut and mounted. Sections were dried,
deparaffinized, and rehydrated. After quenching endogenous peroxidase
activity and blocking nonspecific binding sites, slides were incubated at 4jC
overnight with a 1:100 primary antibody dilution followed by a 30-min
incubation of biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Tissue
sections were then incubated with streptavidin peroxidase and visualized
with the 3,3¶ diaminobenzidine chromogen (Lab Vision Corporation,
Fremont, CA).
Statistical analysis. The effect of A12 on cellular proliferation inhibition,
xenograft growth inhibition, clonogenic survival, and caspase activation was
assessed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test with GraphPad Instat
software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For comparisons between
more than two treatments in the xenograft experiments, multiple regression
analysis was done. If not otherwise indicated, error bars in all experiments
represent the SD.

Results
IGF-IR expression and signal transduction. To establish the
IGF-IR expression profile across a selection of diverse cancer cell
lines, immunoblotting was done on total protein derived from
human breast (MCF-7, SKBr3), prostate (DU145, PC3, LNCaP), lung
(H226, A549), head and neck (SCC1, SCC6), brain (T98G), and
vulvar (A431) cell lines (Fig. 1A). IGF-IR protein expression was
shown in all cell lines tested, including expression in the non–
small cell lung adenocarcinoma H460, colon adenocarcinoma
HT29, and pancreatic line BxPC3 (data not shown). EGFR levels
were simultaneously assessed, demonstrating greater variability of
expression across cell lines and no measurable protein expression
in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells. Thereafter, we evaluated the efficacy of
IGF-I signaling blockade by A12 in the H460 and A549 cell lines.
Robust induction of IGF-IR phosphorylation and phosphorylation
of the downstream effector proteins MAPK and Akt was seen after
30-min exposure to IGF-I when compared with serum-starved or
A12-treated controls (Fig. 1B). IGF-I–dependent phosphorylation of
IGF-IR and MAPK was abrogated by 30-min pretreatment with A12,
and Akt phosphorylation was reduced, demonstrating the ability of
A12 to inhibit IGF-I–dependent signaling through IGF-IR.
Effect of IGF-IR blockade on cell proliferation. An array of
human cancer cell lines was treated with A12 to assess the
antiproliferative effect of IGF-IR blockade under anchorage-

dependent conditions (Fig. 2A). As a proxy for cellular viability
and proliferation status, MTT assays were used to determine the
activity of cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenase. For T98G and
A549 cells, antiproliferative effects were essentially undetectable,
regardless of A12 dose level. More pronounced dose-dependent
antiproliferative effects were seen for MCF7, H460, PC3, SCC1483,
and HT29 cells, whereas more modest antiproliferative activity was
noted for DU145, SCC1, SCC22B, A431, H226, SCC6, and BxPC3 lines.
No correlation between IGF-IR protein levels and antiproliferative
activity was noted; however, cell lines known to secrete IGF-I in an
autocrine loop (MCF-7, HT29, and H226) were among the most
sensitive to IGF-IR signaling inhibition (31–33). When A12 antiproliferative effects were observed, dose-dependent proliferation
inhibition was seen between 1 and 1,000 nmol/L, indicating that no
dose plateau was reached at the highest dose level. Quantitatively
greater antiproliferative effects were seen for A549, H460, and MCF7
cells cultured under anchorage-independent conditions, consistent
with previous reports (data not shown; refs. 17, 30, 34).
A12 activity in tumor xenografts. To determine the effect of
A12 on tumor cell proliferation in vivo, H226 xenografts were
established in athymic mice. A12 or isotype-matched IgG (1 mg)
was delivered i.p. twice weekly beginning on day 15 after tumor cell
inoculation, when tumors exceeded 50 mm3 (n = 4 tumors per
group). By the 3rd week of treatment, there was a 3.2-fold reduction
in tumor volume in the A12-treated animals versus IgG controls
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 2B–C). Xenograft specimens were subsequently
analyzed by immunohistochemistry. IGF-IR expression in A12treated tumors was qualitatively decreased compared with
controls. Moreover, expression of the tumor cell proliferation
marker PCNA was qualitatively lower in A12-treated tumors
relative to controls. These results suggest that in addition to IGFIR signal blockade, A12 impairs H226 cell proliferation in vivo by
down-regulation of IGF-IR.
Clonogenic radiation survival. Growth factor signaling blockade combined with radiation results in favorable anticancer activity
across several growth factor families and cell lines. To determine
whether IGF-IR signal blockade results in a similar effect,
clonogenic radiation survival assays were done using the H460
and H226 cell lines grown under anchorage-dependent conditions
with A12 pretreatment and three single-fraction radiation dose
levels. Reduced clonogenic survival was observed in H460 cells
(Fig. 3A) and H226 cells (Fig. 3B), with a modest radiation doseenhancement factor of 1.2 for both cell lines. These results show a
favorable interaction between IGF-IR blockade and radiation in
H460 and H226 cells.

carried out for phospho–IGF-IR and the
downstream effectors phospho-MAPK
(pMAPK ) and phospho-Akt (pAkt).

Anchorage-independent colony formation. As qualitatively
greater antiproliferative activity was observed with IGF-IR blockade
in cells grown under anchorage-independent conditions, colonyformation assays combining A12 and radiation were done with the
A549 and H460 cell lines. Cells were cultured in the absence or
presence of A12 and irradiated at three dose levels with subsequent
assessment of colony formation. Qualitatively fewer and smaller

colonies were consistently observed in cells exposed to the
combination of A12 and radiation compared with radiation alone
(Fig. 3C). Quantitatively, 20% to 30% fewer colonies were noted for
cells exposed to both A12 and radiation compared with radiation
alone, regardless of radiation dose level (Fig. 3D–E). These results
suggest that IGF-IR blockade interacts with radiation to inhibit
A549 and H460 anchorage-independent colony formation and

Figure 3. IGF-IR blockade impairs clonogenic radiation survival and anchorage-independent colony formation. H460 (A ) and H226 (B ) cells were cultured under
anchorage-dependent conditions in the presence or absence of A12 (100 ng/mL) for 72 h and exposed to three radiation dose levels. Clonogenic radiation survival is
expressed as a surviving fraction of nonirradiated controls for each condition and is plotted on a semilogarithmic scale. H460 were seeded in soft agar to promote
anchorage-independent colony formation as described in Materials and Methods. Cells were embedded in agar containing either isotype-matched IgG (control ) or A12
(100 nmol/L) and irradiated at three dose levels. C, representative high-powered fields demonstrating H460 cell colony growth. A549 (D ) and H460 (E) cell colony

growth. Although showing a similar trend as seen in the clonogenic
radiation survival experiments, colony-formation curves from the
soft agar assays cannot be compared directly to the clonogenic
survival assays, because irradiation was done after cell recovery in
the soft agar medium. In the clonogenic survival assays, irradiation
was done before single-cell plating. Even with these differences in
technique, the results are complementary and indicate an
interaction between A12 and radiation in cells grown under
anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent conditions.
Radiation-induced apoptosis. One mechanism by which
growth factor blockade may result in increased radiation efficacy
is through promotion of apoptotic cell death (35). We therefore did
caspase activation assays in H226 cells combining IGF-IR blockade

and radiation. A 3.1- and 3.9-fold induction of caspase activity
relative to radiation (8 Gy) or A12 (100 nmol/L), respectively, was
observed for H226 cells exposed to both treatments (Fig. 4A).
Furthermore, both A12 and radiation alone or in combination
induced the proapoptotic effector protein Bax in H226 and H460
cells as measured by immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). These results
indicate that A12-mediated IGF-IR signaling blockade combined
with radiation promotes caspase-mediated apoptosis in H226 and
H460 cells.
Radiation-induced, double-stranded DNA damage. The
efficacy of radiation-induced cell lethality is augmented by
inhibition of DNA double-stranded break repair. IGF-I signaling
may counteract UV- or radiation-induced DNA damage by

Figure 5. IGF-IR blockade promotes
radiation-induced DNA damage. H460 cells

promoting DNA repair (36–38). We therefore characterized the
effect of IGF-I and A12 on the formation and repair of radiationinduced DNA double-stranded breaks by detecting phosphohistone H2AX complexes (gH2AX) in irradiated H460 cells. gH2AX
H2AX is a sensitive indicator of radiation-induced DNA doublestranded breaks and is readily detected by immunocytochemistry
(39, 40). Induction of gH2AX foci was observed at 6 h after 6 Gy
irradiation in untreated control cells and in cells exposed to A12
(Fig. 5A). Qualitatively, pretreatment with IGF-I inhibited the
formation of gH2AX complexes; however, simultaneous A12
treatment abrogated this effect (Fig. 5A). At 24 h after irradiation,
expression of gH2AX foci in control and IGF-I–treated cells was
minimal; however, persistent gH2AX complexes were observed in
cells treated with A12 either in the absence or presence of IGF-I
(Fig. 5B). These results suggest that IGF-I promotes repair of
radiation-induced DNA double-stranded breaks, a process that is
inhibited by A12. Furthermore, A12 promotes formation of
persistent DNA double-stranded breaks at 24 h postirradiation
either in the presence of absence of IGF-I.
A12 and radiation in tumor xenografts. Having established a
positive interaction between IGF-IR blockade and radiation in vitro,
we did a parallel study in mice bearing tumor xenografts. H460
tumor cells inoculated into the flanks of athymic mice were grown to
f80 mm3. After loading with 2.5 mg isotype-matched IgG or A12 on
day 15, i.p. IgG or A12 (1 mg) injections were delivered twice weekly.
Animals within each group were stratified by tumor size and
assigned to either no additional treatment or focal radiation directed
to the tumor at 1.5 Gy per fraction, once weekly for 4 weeks. In total,
tumor volumes were obtained and compared for four groups:
IgG alone, A12 alone, IgG and radiation, and A12 and radiation
(Fig. 6). By the 2nd week of treatment, statistically significant
differences in tumor volume were noted between all groups. An
incremental reduction in tumor volume compared with IgG controls
was noted for all groups receiving treatment: A12, radiation, or A12
combined with radiation. At the conclusion of treatment, animals
receiving both A12 and radiation harbored tumors 3.1-fold smaller
than IgG controls (P < 0.001). Tumors from animals receiving either
A12 or radiation alone were 1.3-fold (P < 0.05) and 1.8-fold (P < 0.001)
smaller than controls, respectively. These results indicate antitumor
activity for both A12 and radiation in H460 xenografts and additive
antitumor effects for combined A12 and radiation.

Discussion
Although mouse monoclonal antibodies against IGF-IR have
been available for several decades, anti–IGF-IR agents suitable for
testing in humans have only recently become available. A major
obstacle to selective IGF-IR targeting is the high degree of
homology between IGF-IR and the insulin receptor, making
receptor-specific inhibition challenging. Recent advances in human
monoclonal antibody engineering and small-molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitor screening has yielded several fully human or
humanized anti–IGF-IR monoclonal antibodies and IGF-IR–
specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (21–26, 34). Although these
compounds remain early in their development, preclinical data
justifying their investigation in cancer therapy is emerging. As with
other target-specific therapies, the particular promise for IGF-IR
inhibition may lie in combination with cytotoxic radiation or
chemotherapy, a strategy further justified by the role of IGF-IR in
resistance to these modalities (13–15).

Figure 6. IGF-IR blockade and radiation interact favorably to inhibit tumor
growth in vivo. H460 xenografts were established in athymic nude mice. After
xenografts reached f80 mm3, animals were treated with a loading dose of i.p.
IgG or A12 (2.5 mg) on day 14 and then received IgG or A12 (1 mg) twice weekly.
Animals assigned to receive radiation received 1.5 Gy weekly for 4 wks
beginning on day 17 (vertical arrows ). Tumor measurements were obtained
twice weekly. Points, mean from 16 tumors; bars, SD.

IGF-IR Signaling Blockade and Radiation

In the present study, we examined the interaction between A12induced IGF-IR blockade and radiation. Human tumor cell lines
demonstrating impaired anchorage-dependent and anchorageindependent proliferation in the presence of A12 were used in
clonogenic survival assays, anchorage-independent colony formation assays, and in xenograft studies. We found that the H226 and
H460 cell lines grown under anchorage-dependent conditions
exhibited impaired radiation survival in the presence of A12
when compared with controls (Fig. 3). Postradiation anchorageindependent colony formation of H460 and A549 cells in soft agar
was similarly inhibited by A12 treatment (Fig. 3C-E). Extending
these findings to an in vivo model, H460 xenograft growth was
substantially inhibited with systemic A12 administration combined with radiation compared with either treatment alone
(Fig. 6). Promotion of radiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4) and
inhibition of IGF-I–mediated DNA double-stranded break repair
(Fig. 5) are two mechanisms by which A12 may interact favorably
with radiation.
Several lines of experimental evidence validate IGF-IR signaling
blockade as an important anticancer target that may prove
clinically useful in conjunction with radiation therapy. In a mouse
embryo model system, an IGF-I–mediated cytoprotective effect
was observed (41) and subsequently shown to exert enteric
radioprotection in an animal model, thought to be a consequence
of antiapoptotic effects (42). IGF-IR overexpression is also known
to mediate radioresistance. As evidence of this, fibroblasts
expressing high IGF-IR levels are relatively radioresistant compared
with controls (13). In this same study, tumor samples from patients
undergoing surgery and radiation for breast cancer were analyzed
by immunohistochemistry for IGF-IR expression. High tumor levels
of IGF-IR correlated with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence during
the first 4 years after treatment but no correlation was observed for
late relapses, suggesting an IGF-IR–mediated radiation resistance.
Protection from radiation-induced apoptosis is a potential
mechanism by which IGF-IR may mediate these effects, a function
possibly arising from tyrosine phosphorylation sites within the
COOH-terminal domain that promote signaling through the MAPK
pathway (15). Another mechanism by which IGF-IR may mediate
radioresistance is through modulation of DNA damage repair,
suggested by a study of irradiated mouse cells overexpressing IGFIR, showing that DNA replication time was slowed in these cells
relative to parental controls (43). Further evidence comes from
ATM-deficient cells that are highly radiosensitive and also deficient
in IGF-IR expression. IGF-IR overexpression in these cells
subsequently normalized the radiation response (44). Downregulation of ATM and impaired postradiation ATM kinase
activation has also been observed in cells where IGF-IR expression
is inhibited (45). IGF-I is also known to enhance genomic stability
by promoting homologous recombination-directed DNA repair of
DNA double-stranded breaks caused by irradiation (36). Blockade
of IGF-IR signaling may therefore delay or abrogate radiationinduced DNA double-stranded break repair, a hypothesis supported
by the present study.

Increased IGF-IR expression has been observed in glioblastoma
multiforme cell lines after irradiation, possibly contributing to the
radioresistant phenotype in these cells by mechanisms described
above (46). Indeed, several tumor types express high levels of IGFIR in the absence of radiation induction, including breast, colon,
lung, and prostate cancers (47). Blockade of IGF-IR signaling in
these tumor types is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy
either alone or in combination with radiation or chemotherapy.
In addition to the current study, several lines of preclinical
evidence support the concept that IGF-IR targeting may translate
into clinical benefit when combined with radiation. IGF-IR–null
mouse embryo fibroblasts exhibit increased sensitivity to radiation
compared with wild-type cells (48). Mouse monoclonal antibodies
have also been used to abrogate IGF-IR signaling in cell culture and
xenograft tumor models in combination with cytotoxic therapy.
Colon cancer cells treated in vitro with a combination of 5fluorouracil and irradiation showed augmented cytotoxicity when
treated with the anti–IGF-IR mouse monoclonal antibody aIR3 (49).
Similar results were observed in mouse melanoma cells using
antisense RNA (45). IGF-IR tyrosine kinase inhibition strategies
yield similar radiosensitizing effects. Breast cancer cells treated with
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrophostin AG 1024 were more
sensitive to radiation than untreated controls (50). Gene therapy
approaches have also successfully targeted the IGF-IR. Adenoviruses
expressing a dominant-negative truncated IGF-IR increased the
sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells and xenografts to radiationand chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (51). These results were
extended to xenograft models of lung and colon cancer, with the
observation that IGF-IR down-regulation also resulted in decreased
activation of Akt (52). The potential for IGF-IR inhibition to enhance
the cytotoxicity of radiation and chemotherapy in prostate cancer
cells exhibiting both wild-type and mutant PTEN has been recently
reported (53). In this study, IGF-IR silencing by small interfering
RNA increased sensitivity to both chemotherapy and radiation in
two prostate cancer cell lines, regardless of PTEN status.
Because of its defined role in establishing and maintaining the
cancer phenotype, IGF-IR is a promising anticancer therapy target.
Evidence suggesting a link between IGF-IR signaling and resistance
to cytotoxic therapies provides rationale for combining IGF-IR
inhibitors with radiation or chemotherapy, particularly for tumors
that rely on IGF-IR signaling for growth and survival. The present
study is the first published report to show a favorable interaction
between radiation and IGF-IR blockade with an agent suitable for
clinical translation, forming a rational basis for future investigative
clinical trials.
