BACKGROUND: Patients with urothelial carcinoma are not always amenable to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The authors previously reported that they achieved a 60% response rate in patients who failed on cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) by using a
convenient outpatient regimen of gemcitabine (G) and paclitaxel (P) every 2 weeks. A multicenter trial was
initiated in 5 Italian centers to evaluate this regimen as first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: From January
2003 to April 2005, 54 patients who had histologically proven, measurable disease (according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) with a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status
(PS) from 0 to 2, metastatic or inoperable urothelial carcinoma, no prior systemic cytotoxic or biologic treatment, a creatinine clearance 40 mL per minute, and bilirubin <20 lmol/L received G at a dose of 2500
mg/m2 in 30 minutes and P at a dose of 150 mg/m2 in 3 hours every 2 weeks. Granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was given for 5 to 7 days for neutropenia toxicity of grade 3 (grading determined
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 guidelines).
From 6 to 12 courses were planned. All patients received at least 1 cycle of therapy and were included in all
analyses. RESULTS: The median patient age was 67 years (range 34-78 years), and the median WHO PS was
1 (range, 0-2). Metastases occurred in the lung in 17 patients (31%), in lymph nodes in 26 patients (54%), in
the bladder in 20 patients (37%), in bone in 8 patients (15%), and in the liver in 8 patients (15%). Fifty-nine
percent of patients had >1 site of disease, and 13% of patients had 3 sites of disease. In total, 343 cycles
were administered. Five patients achieved a complete response, and 15 patients achieved a partial response;
thus, the overall response rate was 37% in an intent-to-treat analysis. Hematologic toxicity was predominant
but manageable. G-CSF was used in only 6% of cycles. The median survival was 13.2 months, and the median
time to disease progression was 5.8 months. CONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter study, G and P was found to
be a well–tolerated outpatient regimen. This regimen demonstrated promise and may be considered in

Gemcitabine-Paclitaxel in Urothelial CA/Calabrò et al

Although only 20% of bladder cancers are clinically
advanced at presentation, up to 50% of patients with infiltrating disease will develop recurrent disease or metastases
and ultimately will die from their disease. Although urothelial cancer can be considered a chemosensitive disease, longterm survival remains low, and chemotherapy currently provides the potential for cure only in selected patients.
Cisplatin combinations, such as combined methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC)
and the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, have
been studied extensively and have demonstrated the ability
to produce pathologic complete remissions in patients with
metastatic disease, and long-term survival has been reported
in some patient who achieved complete responses (CRs).2,3
These regimens have remained the standard of care for firstline chemotherapy of advanced bladder cancer.4
Unfortunately, it is not always possible to administer cisplatin-based chemotherapy to this elderly patient
population, in which patients often have poor performance status (PS) and underlying renal insufficiency, either
because of their disease or because of other concomitant
comorbidities. Therefore, regimens with better efficacy
and reduced toxicity are needed.
Gemcitabine, which is an analog of cytosine arabinoside, is an antimetabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis
and ribonucleotide reductase.5 When it is administered as
a single agent, gemcitabine response rates from 23% to
28% have been obtained in both previously treated and
untreated patients.6-10 Although gemcitabine is partially
excreted in the urine, it can be administered to patients
who have modest renal insufficiency.11
Similar to gemcitabine, paclitaxel also has activity in
urothelial carcinoma. A 42% response rate (27% CR rate)
was reported in previously untreated patients when a relatively high dose of paclitaxel (250 mg/m2) was administered in combination with granulocyte–colonystimulating factor (G-CSF).12 Taxanes have the additional advantage of not being dependent on renal excretion and therefore can be administered safely to patients
with renal failure.
We previously reported a phase 2 international trial
with a regimen of gemcitabine at a dose of 2500 mg/m2
to 3000 mg/m2 and paclitaxel at a dose of 150 mg/m2
given every 2 weeks to patients with urothelial carcinoma
who had received previous cisplatin-based chemotherapy.13 The combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel in
Cancer

previously treated patients with recurrent urothelial carcinoma was highly effective and produced objective, durable responses in >60% of patients. Patients who received
this combination after they had failed previous adjuvant or
neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy responded better than those who had been treated previously for metastatic disease.13 This every-2-week regimen was identified
as a well–tolerated outpatient regimen with minimal toxicity, and that led to the current study, in which we evaluated
combined gemcitabine at a dose of 2500 mg/m2 and paclitaxel at a dose of 150 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks in the
first-line setting and its utility in patients who had compromised renal function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patient eligibility criteria included histologically proven
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, ureter, renal pelvis,
or urethra that was stage III disease (tumors classified as
T3b-T4a) or stage IV and metastatic (N2, N3, or M1)
disease (grading determined according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours v1.0 staging system).
Patients with T3b or T4 disease who were included must
have had measurable disease confirmed on a computed tomography scan. If the only measurable disease was in the
bladder, then it must have progressed, and patients must
not have undergone surgery or received radiation with curative intent.
Patients were required to have received no previous
systemic cytotoxic or biologic treatment for advanced disease. They may have received neoadjuvant or adjuvant
chemotherapy (<6 cycles and not with gemcitabine or
paclitaxel) more than 1 year previously. Previous local,
intravesical, adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy
was permitted.
All patients were required to have had a World
Health Organization (WHO) performance status (PS) of
0, 1, or 2; organ function criteria included an absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) >1.5  109/L, a platelet count
>100  109/L, a creatinine clearance 40 mL per minute, and liver bilirubin level <1.2 mg/dL. Patients who
had evidence of squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma histology were excluded from the study. Additional
exclusion criteria were pregnancy, severe congestive heart

failure, and a previous malignancy within 5 years. All
patients provided written informed consent before entering the trial.

Dosage and Administration
Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 150 mg/m2 intravenously over 3 hours on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle.
Gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 2500 mg/m2
intravenously for 30 minutes after the paclitaxel infusion
on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle. All patients received dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg orally every 24 hours and
20 mg intravenously 1 hour before paclitaxel, and they
received clorphenamine at a dose of 10 mg intravenously
and ranitidine at a dose of 50 mg intravenously 1 hour
before paclitaxel.
Patients received G-CSF at a dose of 300 lg (to be
escalated to 600 lg as needed) for 5 to 7 days at the investigator’s discretion if they developed febrile neutropenia
or grade 3/4 neutropenia (grading determined according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 guidelines). Prophylactic
use of G-CSF was recommended beginning on Day 4 after the administration of gemcitabine and paclitaxel if febrile neutropenia occurred in the previous cycle. If, during
G-CSF treatment, the ANC reached a level >30  109/L
at any time, then G-CSF was discontinued.
All patients received the full dose of both drugs on
the first day of treatment. Subsequent dose modifications
were based on hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity.
Three different dose reduction levels were identified:
Dose Levels 0, 1, and 2. At Dose Level 0, or the starting dose, patients received full the doses of paclitaxel (150
mg/m2) and gemcitabine (2500 mg/m2); at Dose Level
1, the doses were reduced to paclitaxel at 125 mg/m2
and gemcitabine at 2000 mg/m2; and, at Dose Level 2,
the doses were reduced to paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2 and
gemcitabine at 1500 mg/m2.
For patients who had a nadir ANC 0.5  109/L
and a platelet count 50  109/L, paclitaxel and gemcitabine were given at the same dose level as the subsequent
cycle. For patients who had a nadir ANC <0.5  109/L
and a platelet count 50  109/L, or a nadir ANC 0.5
 109/L and a platelet count <50  109/L, or a nadir
ANC <0.5  109/L and a platelet count <50  109/L,
paclitaxel and gemcitabine were given at 1 decreased dose
2654

level. No new cycle was initiated unless the ANC was
1.5  109/L and the platelet count was 100  109/L.
Dose escalation was not permitted.
Patients who developed grade 1 nonhematologic toxicity and/or grade 3 nausea and vomiting or alopecia were
treated in the subsequent cycle at the same dose level. In
patients who developed grade 2 or 3 nonhematologic toxicity, treatment was decreased by 1 dose level or was held for a
maximum of 2 weeks until recovery of toxicity to less than
grade 2, depending on the type of nonhematologic toxicity.

Response Evaluation
Patients were evaluated after 4 courses of therapy. To confirm response, a repeat evaluation was performed after
1 month. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) were used.14 The primary bladder cancer (T4)
was used as a target lesion only if it was considered measurable (on a computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance image) as defined by RECIST.
All patients were included in the activity analysis.
Patients who rapidly progressed after 1 course were considered evaluable for response and were been included in
all subsequent analyses.
Patients who had an objective response or no change
and had a stable PS were maintained on treatment up to a
maximum of 12 courses until objective evidence of disease
progression or significant toxicity developed. If a CR was
achieved, treatment was continued for at least 2 more
courses if possible.

Statistical Analysis
The objective of this trial was to determine whether the
combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel was promising
enough to warrant a phase 3 trial. The primary endpoint
was the response rate evaluated as the best objective tumor
response based on RECIST. Secondary endpoints were
duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The optimal 2-stage design proposed by
Simon15 was used to determine the sample size, setting
the significance to 5% and the power to 90%.
Because a response rate of <30% was considered of
no interest and a response rate of 50% was considered
promising, 24 patients were needed in the first phase. If
>8 responses were observed, then an additional 39

patients would be recruited. All patients who received at
least 1 treatment cycle were considered in the intentionto-treat analysis, and efficacy endpoints were evaluated in
that cohort. All patients who received at least 1 dose of
trial medication were included in the safety analysis.
Patient characteristics are reported using descriptive
statistics, including the medians and ranges for continuous variables and absolute counts and percentages for discrete variables. The response rate was calculated along
with its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The time to
event was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between January 2003 and April 2006, 54 patients were
entered onto this phase 2 trial. The clinical characteristics
of all patients are listed in Table 1. Patient ranged in age
between 34 years and 78 years (median age, 67 years).
Forty-nine patients (91%) were men, and 5 patients (9%)
were women. The WHO PS was 0 in 19 patients, 1 in 28
patients, and 2 in 7 patients. The median creatinine clearance was 62 mL per minute (range, 112-41 mL per
minute).
The primary tumor originated in the bladder in 48
patients and in the renal pelvis in 6 patients. Twenty-five

patients (46%) had visceral metastases (bone, liver, or
lung), and the remaining 29 patients (54%) had locoregional disease and/or disease confined to the lymph nodes.
Measurable disease sites including lung lesions in 17
patients (31%), lymph nodes in 29 patients (54%), soft
tissue in 8 patients (15%), liver metastases in 8 patients
(15%) and bone lesions in 8 patients (15%). Twenty-two
patients (41%) had disease in 1 site, 25 patients (46%)
had disease in 2 sites, 5 patients (9%) had disease in 3
sites, and 2 patients (4%) had disease in 4 sites.

In total, 343 cycles were administered. Forty-eight
patients (89%) received al least 2 cycles of treatment. Of
the 6 patients who received <2 cycles, 6 patients had rapid
tumor progression, and 2 patients had severe toxicity.
These patients were included in the denominator for the
calculation of response rates. Patients received a median
of 7 cycles (range, 1-12 cycles), and 12 patients (22%)
received 10 cycles.

Tumor Response
All 54 patients who were enrolled were evaluated for
response. Five patients (9.2%) acheived a CR, 15 patients
(27.7%) achieved a partial response (PR), and the overall
response rate was 36.9% in an intent-to-treat analysis. An
additional 12 patients (22.2%) had stable disease. Of
those who responded, the median time to disease progression was 7.6 months.
The response rate was higher the patients with
locoregional or lymph node disease than for patients with
visceral metastases. A CR was observed in 4 of 29 patients
(13.7%) who had locoregional or lymph node disease and
in only 1 of 25 patients (4%) who had visceral metastases.
In those who responded, the median time to disease progression was 7.6 months.

Survival
At a median follow-up of 30 months, the median survival
was 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.1-16.2 months). Figure 1
illustrates overall survival. The median survival was 14.8
months for patients who had a PS of 0, 13.9 months for
patients who had a PS of 1, and 4.1 months for patients

5.8 months (95% CI, 2.2-9.4 months).

Adverse Events
Table 2 lists the common toxicities observed during the
study. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities, as
expected, were hematologic with an 18% incidence of
grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and a 5% incidence of grade 3
and 4 thrombocytopenia. No hemorrhage or platelet
transfusions were required. Only 2 episodes of neutropenic fever occurred (3.7% of patients).
Severe nonhematologic toxicity was uncommon
with this treatment regimen. Grade 3 and 4 neuropathy
occurred in 11% of patients. One patient had a hypersensitivity reaction during the first cycle and was removed
from the study.

Despite significant progress with combination chemotherapy, advanced urothelial carcinoma remains a fatal disease
for the vast majority of patients who have metastases. Current therapeutic options for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, such as M-VAC or combined gemcitabine
and cisplatin, have a low therapeutic index and are associated with severe toxicities. Therefore, the development of
more active and less toxic treatments for patients with
advanced urothelial carcinoma is necessary.
In this phase 2 study, we report the efficacy and toxicity of an every-2-week outpatient combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel in untreated patients with advanced
or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. An overall response
rate of 37% was observed, and the CR rate was 9%. The
response rate was higher in patients who had regional disease or metastases in the lymph nodes than in patients
who had visceral metastases.
The median survival in this study was 13.2 months
and higher in patients who had a PS of 0 or 1 than in
patients who had a PS of 2. The most frequent toxicity
associated with this biweekly regimen was myelosuppression, which was managed easily and was not associated
with clinically significant events.
Paclitaxel and gemcitabine have been combined in
other schedules and also were evaluated in phase 2 trials in
the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, as illustrated in
Table 3. In a phase 2 study of cisplatin-refractory patients, a
schedule of paclitaxel at a dose of 110 mg/m2 and gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was given every 2 weeks. That
small preliminary study in 11 patients produced a 54%
response rate, a CR rate of 18%, and a PR rate of 36%.16

In a German randomized phase 2 study, 30 patients
with progressive disease received either 6 cycles of 3weekly gemcitabine at a dose of 1250 mg/m2 on Days 1
and 8 and paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 on Day 1
(Schedule A) or every 2-week therapy with gemcitabine at
a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Day 1 and paclitaxel at a dose of
120 mg/m2 on Day 2 (Schedule B).17 The overall objective response rate was 44% with 8 complete remissions
(30%). The median survival was 13 months in Schedule A
and 9 months on Schedule B.
Another every 2-week schema of paclitaxel and gemcitabine was developed in both chemotherapy-naive
patients and pretreated patients who had received up to 2
prior regimens.18 In that multi-institutional phase 2
study, paclitaxel at a dose of 150 mg/m2 and gemcitabine
at a dose of 3000 mg/m2 were given every 2 weeks. Fiftyfive patients (49 chemotherapy-naive patients and 6 pretreated patients) were entered. The preliminary median
survival in chemotherapy-naive patients was 9.5 months.
Responses were observed in 40% of patients, with 1 CR
and 1 PR observed in the 6 previously treated patients.
Those investigators believed that this regimen was active
and well tolerated and may have had compromised efficacy compared with cisplatin-containing regimens. In
that trial, patient selection may have been influential.
In another American phase 2 trial, 54 patients19
with advanced urothelial carcinoma received paclitaxel at
Cancer

June 15, 2009

a dose of 200 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion on Day 1 and
gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and
15 every 3 weeks. Twenty-nine of 54 patients (95% CI,
40%-67%) had major responses and the CR rate was 7%.
At a median follow-up of 24 months, 16 patients (30%)
remained alive, and 9 patients (17%) were progressionfree. The median survival for the entire group was 14.4
months, and the 1-year and 2-year actuarial survival rates
were 57% and 25%, respectively. It is noteworthy that, in
that study, 7 of 15 patients (47%) who previously had
received platinum-based chemotherapy responded to
paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Grade 3 and 4 toxicity was
primarily hematologic and included leucopenia (46%),
thrombocytopenia (13%), and anemia (28%). Ten
patients (19%) required hospitalization for neutropenia
and fever, and 1 patient died of treatment-related sepsis.
The schedule of that regimen with only 1 week of rest
may have been responsible for the hematologic toxicity.
In a study from Indiana University,20 36 patients
with advanced, unresectable transitional cell carcinoma
received paclitaxel at a dose of 110 mg/m2 and gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 every
28 days. Patients who had an objective response or stable
disease continued treatment for a maximum of 6 courses.
Paclitaxel was decreased to 90 mg/m2 and gemcitabine
was decreased to 800 mg/m2 for the last 12 patients
because of a concerning incidence of pulmonary toxicity
2657

Original Article

in the first 24 patients. Twenty-five patients (69.4%) had
a major response to treatment, including 15 CRs
(41.7%). At a median follow-up of 38.7 months, the median survival was 15.8 months. Five patients (13.9%) had
grade 3 through 5 pulmonary toxicity, and 1 patient had
grade 2 pulmonary toxicity. The cause of the increase in
pulmonary toxicity in that study was unknown, although
it had been reported in a gemcitabine and paclitaxel pharmacokinetic study that paclitaxel increased the accumulation of gemcitabine triphosphate, which is the active
metabolite of gemcitabine. The authors concluded that
the incidence of pulmonary toxicity associated with a
weekly schedule was too high.
Two key poor prognostic factors have been identified in this patient population: Poor PS (Karnofsky PS
<80) and visceral metastases adversely affect survival.21 It
is possible that the difference between these various studies and the results reported here are because of differences
in patient selection. Specifically, a greater proportion of
patients with poor prognostic indicators would predict a
lower response rate and poorer survival.
In our study 64% of patients had a WHO PS of 1 or
2, and 66% had visceral metastases. Although these prognostic factors were developed for patients who received
M-VAC, it is likely that they apply to other first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.
Another possible approach for the treatment of
patients with impaired renal function or with other
comorbidities that preclude the use of cisplatin is the use
of carboplatin. Many phase 2 studies have suggested that
carboplatin is not as active as cisplatin. In those studies,
the overall response rate ranged from 36% to 56%,
and median survival ranged from 7.1 months to 10
months.22-28
An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group phase 3
trail comparing paclitaxel-carboplatin with M-VAC in
patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma was closed
early because of poor patient accrual.29 A European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer n EORTC
phase 2/3 trial comparing gemcitabine-carboplatin with
standard M-CAV in cisplatin-ineligible patients is
ongoing.
Adding other new agents to this regimen, such as
oxaliplatin for patients who have failed on cisplatin or
who cannot be treated with cisplatin because of poor renal
function, may be of interest. In a recent multicenter study,
2658

46 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma received
gemcitabine at a dose of 1200 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8
and oxaliplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Day 8 every 21
days.30 Hematologic toxicity in that study was mild, and
grade 3 and 4 peripheral neuropathy occurred in only 4%
of patients. The overall response rate was 48% (3 CRs and
19 PRs), and the median time to disease progression was
5 months.
In conclusion, a schedule of gemcitabine and paclitaxel every 2 weeks was tolerated well by patients with
metastatic urothelial cancer. The CR rate and the median
survival, however, were less than would be expected with
more standard M-VAC or cisplatin and gemcitabine
regimens.
How this regimen may compare with other regimens for patients with modest renal insufficiency is difficult to evaluate given the limited number of such patients
in the current trial. There remains a need to identify both
more active and less toxic treatments for patients who
have metastatic urothelial cancer. The combination of
gemcitabine and paclitaxel using the schedule described in
this report may be useful for patients who have metastatic
urothelial cancer and compromised renal function; however, it cannot be recommended for routine use.
