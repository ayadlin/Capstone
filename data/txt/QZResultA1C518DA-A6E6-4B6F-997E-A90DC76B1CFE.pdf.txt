BACKGROUND: Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) incidence increased steadily in recent decades, but causes remain elusive. Germ
cell function may be influenced by cannabinoids, and 2 prior epidemiologic studies reported that the use of marijuana may be associated with nonseminomatous TGCT. Here, the authors evaluate the relation between TGCTs and exposure to marijuana and other recreational drugs using a population-based case-control study. METHODS: In total, 163 patients who were diagnosed with TGCT in Los
Angeles County from December 1986 to April 1991 were enrolled, and 292 controls were matched on age, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood. Participants were asked about drug use by a structured, in-person interview. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for history of cryptorchidism; education; religiosity;
and reported use of marijuana, cocaine, and amyl nitrite. RESULTS: Compared with never use, ever use of marijuana had a 2-fold
increased risk (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.02-3.68), whereas ever use of cocaine had a negative association with TGCT (OR, 0.54; 95% CI,
0.32-0.91). Stratification on tumor histology revealed a specific association of marijuana use with nonseminoma and mixed histology
tumors (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.08-5.42). CONCLUSIONS: A specific association was observed between marijuana use and the risk of nonseminoma and mixed tumors. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of a negative association between cocaine use and
TGCT risk. The current results warrant mechanistic studies of marijuana’s effect on the endocannabinoid system and TGCT risk and
caution that recreational and therapeutic use of cannabinoids by young men may confer malignant potential to testicular germ cells.

INTRODUCTION
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common neoplasm of adolescent and adult men ages 15 to 45 years,1
and young survivors face significant sequelae, including elevated rates of cardiovascular disease and second primary malignancies.2 Therefore, understanding the etiology of TGCT as the basis of prevention is an important research priority.
TGCT incidence has been rising for decades,3 which implies a change in exposure to 1 or more nongenetic risk or protective factors. However, no such characteristics have been identified despite years of investigation. An established risk factor
for TGCT is cryptorchidism, or undescended testicles, which, in rodent models, can be caused by exogenous estrogens
during key periods of development.4,5 These findings, along with epidemiologic data indicating the onset of greatest
TGCT risk around the time of puberty, implicate aberrant effects of steroid hormones in the perinatal and peripubertal
periods. Potential exposures in the perinatal period include elevated maternal estrogens and exposure to exogenous hormones, such as diethylstilbestrol. However, studies of these exposures are limited by the need to retrospectively measure
relevant exposures after TGCT diagnosis, 15 or more years later. Additional epidemiologic data are consistent with the
possibility that risk may be related to variation in endogenous hormone levels during puberty, because proxies such as
severe acne and male pattern baldness were associated with an increased likelihood of testis cancer.6
More recently, exogenous compounds with postulated or demonstrated endocrine function have been proposed as
possible testicular carcinogens, with polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorines, and other persistent organic pollutants
implicated by recent epidemiologic studies.7-10 Constituents of marijuana smoke also may act on the endocrine system,

and marijuana use has increased in recent decades11,12
and is highest among males ages 15 to 20 years in the
United States.12 Thus, Daling et al postulated that marijuana use may increase TGCT risk and, in a populationbased case-control study,13 observed that patients with
TGCT were more likely to have smoked marijuana and
that the risk increased with frequency and duration of use,
as well as earlier initiation of use and use ongoing until diagnosis. The association was limited to nonseminoma histologic types. Subsequent results from a smaller, hospitalbased, friend-control study also reported an association of
marijuana use with the risk of nonseminoma.14 Results
from those studies and the biologic plausibility of endocrine action of marijuana constituents indicate that marijuana smoke may contain a testicular carcinogen.
Alternatively, the reported marijuana-testis cancer association may arise at least in part from a tendency of men who
smoke marijuana to more frequently experience unrecognized testis cancer risk factors, such as psychosocial correlates of marijuana use, which may include exposure to
other recreational drugs. In the current population-based
case-control study, we estimated associations between testis cancer risk and exposure to marijuana, accounting for
several demographic factors and detailed histories of other
recreational drug use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Participants and Data

A population-based case-control study was conducted in
Los Angeles County, California to investigate associations
of testis cancer risk with exposures of the perinatal period,
childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. Eligible
cases were men diagnosed with TGCT between December 20, 1986 and April 4, 1991 in Los Angeles County;
who were ages 18 to 35 years at diagnosis; spoke English;
and were born either in the United States, Europe, Canada, or the Middle East. The Los Angeles County Cancer
Surveillance Program identified 201 men who met these
criteria. Of these, 8 had either died before being contacted
or were too ill to participate, 6 had cognitive difficulties
precluding participation, 14 could not be located, 2 were
not invited to participate because health care providers
denied permission to contact, and 8 chose not to participate. The remaining 163 eligible cases (81%) participated
in the study. For each participating case, we attempted to
enroll up to 4 unaffected control men who were matched
to the case on date of birth (within 3 years), race, ethnicity, and neighborhood of residence at the time of diagnosis. An established procedure was used to identify
potential controls by defining a sequence of housing units

on a specified block; attempting to identify the sex, age,
race, and ethnicity of the inhabitants of each unit; and
thereby determining whether 1 or more appropriately
matched potential controls were identified. If no potential
control was identified after canvassing 150 units, then
race was excluded from the matching criteria; and, if a
matched control based on the relaxed criteria was not
identified within 150 subsequent units, then the case was
not included in matched case-control analyses. The procedure described above identified 371 individuals as potential controls for the 163 eligible cases. Of these, 292 men
(78.7%) chose to participate. We enrolled controls that
were not matched on race/ethnicity for 24 cases, and we
were unable to enroll any matched control for 24 additional cases. From 1 to 4 matched controls were enrolled
for each remaining case: We identified 1 control for 16
cases, 2 controls for 95 cases, 3 controls for 26 cases, and 4
controls for 2 cases.
Interviews were conducted in person at participants’
homes and were administered by trained interviewers
using structured questionnaires. All participants were
interviewed between October 16, 1987 and December
15, 1994. Information was requested for a reference period up to 1 year before the diagnosis of TGCT for cases
and the same date for each case’s matched controls. Participants were asked to provide demographic information;
family history of specific cancers and urogenital conditions; personal history of some infectious diseases; and
personal use of tobacco, alcohol, and numerous recreational drugs. Participants were asked whether they had
ever used each drug, and ever users were asked the first
and last years of use and the average number of times per
week of use.
Statistical Methods

Relevant variables from the questionnaire were tested
individually using univariate conditional logistic regression that estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The current analyses were focused
on use of recreational drugs in relation to TGCT risk. We
selected for model-building variables that either were notable for the magnitude of their disease association or statistical significance or were demonstrated TGCT risk
factors.
All drugs were treated as dichotomous variables
indicating ever use versus never use, and ever use of most
drugs was divided further into current use at reference
date or former use. Frequency of use was categorized as
never, less than once per week, or more than once per
week. Duration of use was categorized as never, less than
5375

Original Article

10 years of use, and 10 or more years of use. Sensitivity
analyses were conducted to explore the effect of using different cutoff points for categories of marijuana frequency
and duration. Duration of alcohol consumption was not
queried. Because of sparse numbers, duration of mushroom use was categorized as never, less than 2 years, or
more than 2 years (the median duration of mushroom
use), and frequency and duration of use were not examined for mushrooms; barbiturates; heroin; lisergic acid
diethylamide (LSD); Quaaludes; phencyclidine (PCP);
ethyl chloride; butyl nitrate; poppers other than amyl nitrite, ethyl chloride, or butyl nitrate; or recreational drugs
other than those queried in the interview.
The covariates that were used in the multivariate
models were selected by adding variables 1 at a time to the
model and assessing whether the point estimate of the OR
changed by >10%, and covariates with this level of influence were retained in the model. The following covariates
were identified as confounders of associations between use
of marijuana or cocaine and TGCT: cryptorchidism (yes
vs no), religiosity (any religious affiliation vs none), and
education level (college degree or higher, some college,
high school diploma, or less than a high school diploma).
In addition, estimates of association for each other drug
were adjusted for ever use of marijuana, cocaine, and amyl
nitrite.
By using information from original pathology
reports, histologic type was coded as either seminoma
(International Classification of Diseases for Oncology histology codes 9061, 9062, and 9063), nonseminoma
(codes 9065, 9070, 9071, 9080, 9082, 9083, 9084, and
9100), or mixed germ cell tumors (GCTs) (codes 9081,
9085, and 9101). For statistical analyses, we distinguished
between pure seminoma of any type (seminoma) and nonseminoma or mixed GCT of any type (nonseminoma/
mixed GCT). These definitions follow the convention of
grouping histologic types according to the degree of differentiation while constituting subgroups likely to be uniformly scored between clinical centers and from the study
enrollment period forward in time. Moreover, they are
comparable to the definitions used in published studies
that address marijuana use in relation to TGCT risk.13,14
Heterogeneity of disease associations of selected drugs
across histologic subtypes of TGCT (seminoma vs nonseminoma/mixed GCT) was tested by including an interaction term between histology and the respective main
variable into the conditional logistic model together with
confounders. Controls were coded with the same histology as their matched case. Histology-specific ORs were
computed using the full model with the interaction term.

RESULTS
Cases were more likely than controls to have a history of
cryptorchidism (10.4% vs 2.7%) and to have a higher education level, and they were less likely than controls to report
a religious affiliation (Table 1). Ever use of marijuana was
associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of TGCT of
any histologic type (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.02-3.68), after
adjusting for education, religiosity, history of cryptorchidism, ever use of cocaine, and ever use of amyl nitrite. Compared with never users, current marijuana users had a
nonsignificant increase in risk (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.672.87), whereas former users had greater than 2-fold risk
(OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.17-4.43). These associations did
not follow simple dose-response patterns over categories
defined by duration or frequency of use. For example,
compared with never users, those who reported using marijuana less often than once per week were more than twice
as likely to develop TGCT (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.094.03), whereas those who reported more frequent use had a
lesser and nonsignificant increase in risk (OR, 1.53; 95%
CI, 0.73-3.24). Men who reported <10 years of marijuana
use were more than twice as likely to develop TGCT (OR,
2.09; 95% CI, 1.09-3.98), whereas a lesser and nonsignificant increase was observed for those reporting 10 years of
use (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.66-3.47) (Table 2).
Men who reported ever using cocaine had a notably
reduced risk of TGCT in analyses that were adjusted for
the above-mentioned covariates and marijuana use (OR,
0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91). There was no indication that
the risk differed further across categories of frequency or
duration.
Although the estimate of an association between
amyl nitrite use and TGCT did not achieve statistical significance (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-1.02), ever use of this
drug did confound estimates of disease associations with
ever use of both marijuana and cocaine and, thus, was
included as a covariate in final analytic models. Neither
pronounced disease associations nor confounding effects
were noted for reported use of inhaled ethyl chloride,
butyl nitrate, or other poppers; hallucinogenic mushrooms; amphetamines; barbiturates; LSD; Quaaludes;
PCP; heroin; reported use of any recreational drug not
specifically queried in the interview; or a derived variable
combining reported use of any of the aforementioned
drugs, alcohol, or tobacco smoked in cigarettes.
Ever use of marijuana appeared to be unassociated
with risk of seminoma (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.37-3.07)
(Table 3) but was associated with a greater than 2-fold risk
of either nonseminoma or mixed GCT (OR, 2.42; 95%
CI, 1.08-5.42). Associations with nonseminoma or mixed

A history of TGCT was reported for a brother of 1 case and the father of 1 control.

GCT were more pronounced for former marijuana use
(OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.29-7.19) than for current marijuana
use (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.64-4.01). However, the latter
association did not achieve statistical significance, in part
because there were fewer current users. Further stratification of current users’ data on frequency or duration of use
yielded estimates that also were not statistically significant.
Among former users, there was a 3-fold association of marijuana use among those who reported use less frequent
than once per week (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.34-8.09);
although the association estimated among more frequent
users was somewhat lower, it did not achieve statistical significance (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.74-6.61). Among former
users, estimates within both substrata of duration achieved
significance, with the association corresponding to longer
duration of use (OR, 6.67; 95% CI, 1.37-32.5) exceeding
that for shorter duration (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.15-6.86).
By contrast, the data suggest that any inverse association of
ever using cocaine varied little between seminoma (OR,
0.46; 95%CI, 0.20-1.03) and nonseminoma or mixed
GCT (OR, 0.63; 95%CI, 0.33-1.21).
DISCUSSION
We report a 2-fold increased risk of TGCT among ever
users of marijuana compared with never users. FurtherCancer

more, we observed that ever users of marijuana had a
greater than 2-fold risk of nonseminoma/mixed germ cell
tumors compared with never users. In contrast, marijuana
use was not associated with the risk of seminoma. The
moderate but nonsignificant elevation in the risk of mixed
GCTs among marijuana users may represent a mixture of
effects on seminoma and nonseminoma. These results are
in accord with the general findings of both previous epidemiologic studies that explored marijuana use and TGCT
risk.13,14 However, the greater TGCT risk we observed
among former users of marijuana compared with current
users and the greater risk among infrequent users compared with frequent users was not observed in previous
studies. We also observed greater risk among men who
had <10 years of use than among those who reported use
of longer duration, a pattern that also was reported by 1
previous study13 when all tumor histologies were combined. Various results may have arisen from the combined
influence of differing measures of frequency and duration
of marijuana exposure used in the 3 studies,13,14 from the
differing analysis models used in each, from the imperfect
measurement of covariates, or simply from sampling variation, because relatively small numbers of patients with
nonseminoma participated in each study. Differences also
may have arisen in part from nonsynchronous assessment

of exposure, because trends of marijuana use have been
changing,11,12 and enrollment into the current study
tended to occur earlier than enrollment into the others.
Nonetheless, the results presented here confirm both the
epidemiologic association of marijuana use with TGCT
risk and the specificity of this risk factor for nonseminomatous tumors.
The main psychoactive compound in marijuana,
D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), binds and partially agonizes the human cannabinoid (CB) receptors, CB1 and
CB2. These receptors are activated by endocannabinoids
(ECs), mainly N-arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) and
2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). AEA also binds and stimulates the transient potential vanilloid receptor type 1
(TRPV1), which has been proposed to confer heat resistance to germ cells and maturing sperm.15 AEA is degraded
in the cell by fatty acid amid hydrolase (FAAH).16 CB
receptors and their endocannabinoid ligands are expressed
5380

in the pituitary and hypothalamus, and it has been demonstrated that they are involved in the regulation of reproduction at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels.16 In
males, as reviewed by Pagotto et al,17 it has been demonstrated that cannabinoids decrease luteinizing hormone
(LH), decrease testosterone production and secretion, and
suppress spermatogenesis, in accordance with reports
indicating reduced testosterone levels after marijuana use.
Both CB1 and CB2 also are expressed in the male reproductive system, with distinct patterns of cellular and developmental specificity. In mice, messenger RNA and
protein encoded by the CB2 ortholog are expressed in all
stages of spermatogenesis, whereas 2-AG levels are highest
in spermatogonia (germline stem cells in the sexually
mature male) and gradually diminish in subsequent stages
of spermatogenesis, whereas AEA levels are relatively
unchanged.18 These precise expression patterns may
reflect the regulation of crucial events in spermatogenesis

by endogenous cannabinoid signaling, because mice that
were engineered to be unable to express the CB2 ortholog
had pronounced reproductive deficits, and endocannibinoid system (ECS) signaling in the male reproductive system is conserved across several species.18 Therefore, it is
plausible that unscheduled signaling by exogenous THC
may impair testicular health by disrupting ECS signaling
either in the pituitary and hypothalamus or in the gonads.
Cannabinoid compounds, including THC, in various model systems have demonstrated proapoptotic, antiproliferative,
antiangiogenic,
antimigrative,
and
antiadhesive properties.19 Limited mechanistic investigation has indicated that these effects are mediated by
numerous pathways, some of which involve signaling
through CB1, CB2, and TRPV1.19 Therefore, the cannabinoid system is investigated increasingly as a potential
source of novel chemotherapeutics. Although these observations may appear to be at odds with the carcinogenic
effects of marijuana on the testis, the directions of some
biologic effects of cannabinoids appear to be tissue-specific and cell type-specific,19 and we are unaware of any
pharmacologic research addressing cannabinoid signaling
in the testis. Thus, it is too early to speculate whether this
avenue of research will provide biologic insight into the
plausibility of a causal role for marijuana use in the development of nonseminomatous and mixed histology
tumors of the testis.
The specific association between marijuana use and
the risk of nonseminomatous and mixed histology TGCT
has yet to be explained. However, a mechanism involving
androgen signaling or response may be plausible, because
THC recently was linked to androgen levels; and, based
on recent results presented elsewhere, we postulate that
variation in androgen receptor (AR) biology may distinguish TGCT histology. In a separate population-based
epidemiologic study, we observed shorter CAG repeat
lengths in exon 1 of the AR gene, and it is predicted that
these result in greater AR transactivation20 and are associated with the risk of seminoma, whereas the opposite association was observed for nonseminoma.21 However, data
on the association of TGCT histology with genotypes
defined by this polymorphism are not entirely consistent.
Although 4 hospital-based case-control studies22-25 also
reported an association between longer AR CAG repeats
and nonseminoma, the results were not statistically significant, and 1 of those studies revealed significantly greater
frequency of shorter repeats in patients with seminomas
than in patients with nonseminomas.23 No such difference was reported in 2 of those studies22,24; although the
fourth study reported no association between repeat

length and nonseminoma alone or all TGCTs, it did not
report on comparisons of repeat length between patients
with seminoma alone versus either unaffected controls or
men with nonseminoma alone.25 Apart from age at diagnosis, few other factors have been associated differentially
with seminomas and nonseminomas. Therefore, to provide further insight regarding the histology-specific association of marijuana use observed here and reported in the
earlier studies,13,14 it seems advisable for future TGCT
research to address marijuana jointly with indicators of
androgen action.
To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiologic
study to investigate the use of cocaine and additional recreational drugs in relation to TGCT risk. We observed an
association between reported use of cocaine and lesser risk
of TGCT, which appeared strongest for mixed GCTs. A
mechanism whereby cocaine may reduce TGCT risk has
not been proposed, but a parsimonious explanation may
be loss of germ cells through a cocaine-mediated process.
The effects of cocaine on the murine testis suggest several
means whereby exposure plausibly may result in germ cell
death. Experimental administration of cocaine causes several morphologic changes of the rat testis: seminiferous
tubule diameter and germinal epithelium are reduced,26,27
and spermatogenesis is rapidly disrupted accompanied by
cell sloughing and reduction in testicular volume.27 Ultrastructural changes were observed in Sertoli cells and germ
cells but not in Leydig cells, suggesting germinal lines as
primary site of cocaine’s testicular toxicity.27 Although the
mechanism underlying these changes has not been identified, Li et al28 identified a receptor protein in rat testes that
saturably and specifically binds cocaine. If this receptor is
involved in testicular maintenance, then the endogenous
ligand may be unable to fulfill its normal function in the
presence of cocaine. An equally plausible explanation,
because cocaine causes severe vasoconstriction, may simply
be hypoxic cell death within the testis.28 Finally, a role for
cocaine in opposing effects of THC was suggested by metabolic studies that assessed the effects of both drugs in the
rat,29 in which a general trend of reduced glucose use was
identified after administration of THC and was counteracted when cocaine was administered with THC. Without
suggesting a specific metabolic mechanism whereby cocaine may protect against TGCT, these results indicate
interplay between the effects of these 2 drugs, which may
be germane to the opposing associations with TGCT risk
reported here.
Cocaine use was identified as an important confounder in our analyses of marijuana effects, as may be
anticipated, because marijuana use is associated with a
5381

Original Article

tendency to use other recreational drugs. It appears that
other studies estimating associations between marijuana
use and TGCT risk did not address potential confounding effects of cocaine. True effects of marijuana use in
these source populations may be somewhat greater than
reported if cocaine also is associated with lesser risk in
these settings.
Strengths of our study include the population-based
design and the extensive in-person interviews that
included queries about demographic variables, risk factors, and detailed history of use of numerous recreational
drugs. Statistical power of the study was adequate to
examine main disease associations with respect to dichotomized levels of strong risk factors, even within subgroups of tumor histology. However, the study size was
not adequate to address marijuana dose by jointly examining associations with respect to recency, frequency, and
duration of use. Neither were we able to examine statistical interactions between exposures or to statistically test
the heterogeneity of single exposure associations across
histologic subtypes.
Several cautions should attend the interpretation of
case-control data on self-reported drug use. Previous
authors13,14 noted that controls may be less motivated
than cases to report use of illicit drugs, which may create
spurious associations between disease risk and drug use.
However, such reporting bias appears to be a less likely explanation for the specific association of marijuana use
with nonseminoma or mixed GCT consistently observed
in the current study and in previous studies.13,14 Moreover, such bias would not lead to the association of cocaine use with lesser TGCT risk observed in the current
study. Therefore, observed associations are unlikely to
have arisen from reporting bias alone.
However, use of each of the specific drugs investigated in this study may be associated with other unmeasured exposures, behaviors, or sociodemographic factors
that may have confounded the association between marijuana use and the risk of nonseminomatous TGCT. Recognized correlates of marijuana use were not completely
captured by our questionnaire, because these include
complex psychosocial variables, including sensation-seeking behavior, peer-group integration, and parental or
adult supervision.30 Our study did query religion, a negative correlate of marijuana use that was identified as a confounder of the marijuana-TGCT association. For
confounding by unmeasured variables to account for
reported marijuana-TGCT associations, such factors
would need to be associated with marijuana use in source
populations for all 3 studies and would have to be associ5382

ated specifically with the risk of nonseminoma. Similar
forms of unrecognized bias conceivably may be present in
all 3 studies, which are similar in numerous respects; however, it seems far less likely that the specific association
with a single histologic subtype would be spurious.
We conclude that marijuana use is associated with
an elevated risk of TGCT, especially nonseminoma or
mixed histology tumors. This consistent finding across 3
epidemiologic studies now warrants mechanistic research
investigating biologic processes whereby constituents of
marijuana smoke may influence testicular carcinogenesis.
Moreover, the possibility that any effect of marijuana on
TGCT risk may involve perturbation of the endocannabinoid system should be considered if cannabinoid agonists
or antagonists are to be used as therapeutic agents, as has
been proposed for numerous conditions, including endocrine-related cancers and infertility.18,31,32
