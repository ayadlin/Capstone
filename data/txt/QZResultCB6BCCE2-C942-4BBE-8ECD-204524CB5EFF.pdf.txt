BACKGROUND: Reports have demonstrated the superior activity of combining both irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFOXIRI) therapy.
An option for gaining similar benefits with less toxicity would be the administration of irinotecan through a hepatic artery approach.
The aim of this study was to assess the response and adverse event rates for irinotecan drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) with folinic acid,
5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for unresectable colorectal liver metastasis. METHODS: Patients with colorectal liver metastases were randomly assigned to modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) and bevacizumab or mFOLFOX6, bevacizumab, and DEBIRI (FOLFOX-DEBIRI). The primary endpoint was the response rate. The secondary endpoints were
adverse events, the rate of conversion to resection, and progression-free survival. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population comprised 70 patients: 10 patients in the pilot and then 30 patients randomly assigned to the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm and 30 patients randomly assigned to the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm. The 2 groups were similar with respect to the extent of liver involvement (30% vs
30%), but a greater percentage of patients in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 1 or 2 (57% vs 31%) and extrahepatic disease (56% vs 32%, P 5.02). The median numbers of chemotherapy cycles were similar (10 vs 9), and there were similar rates of grade 3/4 adverse events (54% for the FOLFOX-DEBIRI group vs 46% for the FOLFOX/
bevacizumab group). The overall response rate was significantly greater in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm versus the FOLFOX/bevacizumab
arm at 2 (78% vs 54%, P 5.02), 4 (95% vs 70%, P 5.03), and 6 months (76% vs 60%, P 5.05). There was significantly more downsizing
to resection in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm versus the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm (35% vs 16%, P 5.05), and there was improved median
progression-free survival (15.3 vs 7.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous administration of mFOLFOX6 (with or without bevacizumab) and DEBIRI through the hepatic artery (FOLFOX-DEBIRI) is safe and does not cause treatment delays or increase the systemic toxicity of chemotherapy. This strategy leads to improved overall response rates, improved hepatic progression-free survival,

INTRODUCTION
Surgical resection provides the potential for a long-term disease-free interval; it still remains the ultimate goal for patients
who present with initially unresectable liver metastases.1 Therefore, a major goal of current therapeutic strategies is to optimize the response and downsize metastatic disease to resectability.2,3
The current optimal first-line therapy for patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases is typically multiagent chemotherapy based on either folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil,
irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). Recent single-institution studies have demonstrated enhanced response rates

with the use of a FOLFIRINOX-based regimen with high
rates of downsizing to resection and acceptable R0 resection rates.4 The challenge with the use of either FOLFIRINOX- or FOLFOX-based chemotherapy has been the
ability to tolerate more than approximately 4 to 6 cycles.
In particular, older patients have limited tolerance for
more aggressive systemic chemotherapy with the former
and a high risk of chemotherapy-associated endothelialitis
with the latter.5,6
Recent advances in hepatic-directed therapy in the
setting of liver metastasis for metastatic colorectal cancer
have been published.7,8 The use of irinotecan drugeluting beads (DEBIRI) has been published recently, and
researchers have demonstrated initial safety,9 tolerance,7,10 and minimal to negligible systemic exposure of
irinotecan when irinotecan is delivered into the hepatic artery through a lobar approach in combination with systemic intravenous FOLFOX and bevacizumab.8
Thus, we hypothesize that patients who are treated
concurrently with systemic FOLFOX (with or without bevacizumab) and DEBIRI will have a similar chemotherapeutic
toxicity profile, enhanced overall response rates at 2, 4, and 6
months, responses of longer duration and greater durability,
and possibly greater rates of downsizing to resection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A Federal Drug Administration–exempted (Investigational Drug Exemption submission G080230-S001),
University of Louisville institutional review board–
approved, prospective, multi-institutional phase 2 clinical
evaluation of DEBIRI (LC/DC Bead; Biocompatibles
UK, Ltd) in combination with systemic mFOLFOX6 was
performed from June 2009 to March 2014 (Fig. 1).
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects before
any treatment. The first 10 enrolled patients were mandated by the Food and Drug Administration to be treated
only in the treatment arm (FOLFOX-DEBIRI) for safety
and pharmacokinetic studies; it then allowed 60 patients
to be randomly assigned to either the treatment arm
(30 patients) or the control arm (FOLFOX; 30 patients).
The inclusion criteria required patients to be older
than 18 years, have histologically proven colorectal cancer to
the liver, be chemotherapy-naive for their metastatic disease,
have liver-dominant disease (defined as 80% of the tumor
body burden being confined to the liver) but less than 60%
liver replacement by the tumor, and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score  2.
Exclusion criteria included being eligible for curative
treatment (ie, resection or radiofrequency ablation)
and not fitting the inclusion criteria defined previously.

Surgical resectability was the ability to leave adequate
inflow and outflow for hepatic hypertrophy and recovery
as defined by prior consensus guidelines.11
The treatment scheme involved standard chemotherapy administration on days 0 and 14 and the delivery of
DEBIRI on days 7 and 21 (Table 1). Modified FOLFOX6
dosing was used, with the oxaliplatin dose set at 85 mg/
m2.8 The use of bevacizumab was left to the discretion of
the treating medical oncologist and was based on potential
contraindications (eg, intact primary tumor with a history
of bleeding, recent surgery, and cardiovascular issues).
The DEBIRI treatment technique has been described
in detail in our prior studies.11,12 In short, it was performed
through a femoral or axillary artery puncture, and after appropriate anatomic identification of the right and left hepatic
arteries, 1 vial of beads was eluted with the desired amount of
irinotecan chemotherapy. The treatment was performed with
a lobar approach on the basis of the extent and distribution of
the disease, with most treatments being performed in the outpatient setting. A technical DEBIRI success was defined as
the ability to deliver at least 75% of the planned dose (ie,
beads loaded with 75 mg of irinotecan). The number of treatments was determined by the physician after reevaluation
with imaging after the 4 cycles of FOLFOX and 2 DEBIRI
treatments on the basis of the degree of response, tolerance of
combination therapy, and quality of life.
The device used to deliver irinotecan in this DEBIRI
study was an n-Fil sulfonate–modified, spherical hydrogel
device. Unloaded LC Bead has Food and Drug Administration 510(k) clearance as a class II embolic device, and it
is Conformite Europeenne mark–approved as a drug
delivery embolization system loadable with irinotecan for
the treatment of liver metastases of colorectal cancer. Irinotecan was loaded into DEBIRI at 50 mg/mL for a total
dose of 100 mg per vial.
All adverse events were recorded per standards and
terminology set forth by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation
Program’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0).12
Follow-up assessments included a triphasic computed tomography scan of the liver within at least 1 to 2
months of treatment completion to evaluate the enhancement pattern of the target lesion and tumor response rates,
which were measured according to the modified Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).13 A target lesion (either hepatic or nonhepatic) was defined as
any lesion  1 cm in size. Hepatic target lesions were
defined as the largest lesions (up to 5) within the liver that
were 1 cm in size. Nontarget liver lesions were any
lesions  1 cm in size other than the 5 lesions that were

defined as target lesions. Nonhepatic, nontarget lesions
were defined as any lesions outside the liver that were
1 cm in size (eg, portal lymph nodes and lung nodules).
Surgical resectability was reassessed after each set of
4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy (ie, after the 4th, 8th,
and 12th cycles). The decision for surgical resection was
made by the treating surgeon on the basis of established
criteria for resectability as reported.14 A central assessment
of the tumor response was performed for all patients by
the principal investigator at the University of Louisville.
When there was a discrepancy, the registry’s principal investigator and the site’s principal investigator reviewed the

case again for concurrent agreement. Response rates were
also calculated via a blinded, external review, which
assessed the responses of both target liver lesions (up to 5)
and nonliver, nontarget lesions with both RECIST
1.112,15 and Choi’s criteria16 to evaluate response rates.
Statistical Analysis

The statistical analysis of the data was performed with
JMP 8.0. We estimated that the response rate in the intravenous chemotherapy group could be assumed to be 60%,
and we estimated a response rate of 80% in the FOLFOXDEBIRI group. The sample size of 70 patients (40 in the

exact test to detect the given difference between the
assumed proportions at a significance level of .05.

RESULTS
Between June 29, 2009 and November 19, 2012, 70
patients from 9 institutions were enrolled in this prospective, randomized phase 2 clinical trial, which was coordinated through the University of Louisville and the James
3652

Graham Brown Cancer Center, and there was follow-up
through March 30, 2014. Patient characteristics and primary disease sites are summarized in Table 1. A majority
of the patients presented with synchronous colon or rectal
disease at the time of presentation and enrollment (53%
in the treatment arm and 57% in the control arm; P 5 not
significant). All enrolled patients were chemotherapynaive; however, the treatment group had a statistically
significantly worse overall performance status (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or
2, 56% in the treatment group vs 32% in the control
group; P 5 .04). Similarly, there was a greater incidence
of patients with liver-dominant disease (ie, the presence of
extrahepatic disease) versus liver-only disease in the treatment arm (55%) versus the control arm (31%; P 5 .05).
The remaining parameters of the tumor burden, bilobar
disease, and numbers of target lesions were similar in the 2
groups (Table 1).
Forty patients in the treatment arm underwent a
total of 115 DEBIRI treatments (Table 2). A majority of
the patients received at least 2 DEBIRI treatments, with
the median number of DEBIRI treatments being 4 (Table
2). The DEBIRI technique was a technical success in 84%
of the 115 procedures. Tolerance of the DEBIRI treatment was similar for all patients, and there were minimal
to no changes in the overall performance status (Table 2).
A total of 613 chemotherapeutic doses were delivered to the patients (Table 3). There was a significant
increase in any type of dose delay, which was defined as
dose administration more than 24 hours later than the
planned dose, in the treatment group (25%) versus the
control group (14%; P 5 .0002), with the most common reasons being scheduling, neutropenia, and pancytopenia. There was no significant difference in dose
delays when hematologic reasons were evaluated. There
was no difference in dose-limiting toxicity, with equal
percentages of patients having dose-limiting toxicity
that required them to have more than 21 days between
their FOLFOX dosing schedules (treatment doselimiting toxicities: 3.5% of doses in the treatment arm
vs 3.0% of doses in the control arm). There were similar
rates of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil dose reductions
in the 2 arms (Table 3).
The adverse event profiles of both arms are demonstrated and summarized in Table 4. There was a significantly
greater incidence of grade 3/4 toxicities in the treatment arm,
predominantly because of device-related serious adverse
events (Table 4). Device-related serious adverse events were
recorded if a patient had to stay in the hospital longer than
23 hours or was re-admitted to the hospital after DEBIRI

After a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 1738 months), the overall response rates, as measured with
the modified RECIST criteria, were statistically significant superior at 2 (P 5 .01), 4 (P 5 .03), and 6 months
(P 5 .05) in the treatment arm versus the control arm,
predominantly because of enhanced complete and partial
responses (Fig. 2A). There were similar statistically significant improvements in 2- (P 5 .02), 4- (P 5 .03), and
6-month response rates (P 5 .05) for just the target lesions
in the treatment arm versus the control arm (Fig. 2B).
Enrolled patients then underwent a blinded radiologic review with the established RECIST 1.1 criteria or
Choi’s criteria. According to RECIST, there was a
nonsignificant improvement in the overall response at 2,
4, and 6 months in the treatment arm versus the control
arm (88% vs 89%, 97% vs 95%, and 92% vs 89%,
respectively). For target lesions, according to RECIST,
the treatment and control groups were similar at 2 (100%
vs 95%, respectively), 4 (100% vs 90%, respectively), and
6 months (98% vs 91%, respectively).
There was a significant improvement in the 2-month
overall response (98% for the DEBIRI group vs 82% for the
control group; P 5 .01), and there were nonsignificant
improvements in the 4- (100% for the DEBIRI group vs
89% for the control group; P 5 .09) and 6-month overall
response (95% for the DEBIRI group vs 92% for the control
group; P 5 .12) according to Choi’s criteria. The overall durability of the response or the greatest response was also significantly greater in the DEBIRI treatment arm (12-month
response with FOLFOX-DEBIRI, 50%) versus the control
arm (12-month response, 24%; Fig. 1).
After a median follow-up of 24 months, there was a
nonsignificant improvement in progression-free survival
in the control arm (median, 15 months; range, 10.4-20
months) versus the treatment arm (median, 12 months;
range, 9-15.4 months; P 5 .18). In an evaluation of livertarget progression-free survival, neither median survival
was reached with significant response rates out to
24 months. In an evaluation of liver nontarget liver-only
progression-free survival, there was an improvement
in the DEBIRI treatment arm (median, 21 months;
range, 12-28 months) versus the control arm (median,
15 months; range, 10.8-24 months; P 5 .68). There was a
statistically significant improvement in liver progressionfree survival in the treatment group (median, 17 months;
range, 12-23 months) versus the control group (median,
12 months; range, 11-24 months; P 5 .05). Overall extrahepatic progression-free survival was similar in the 2
groups: the treatment median was 13.7 months (range,

DISCUSSION
The FOLFOX-DEBIRI trial is the first randomized trial
to our knowledge to evaluate the treatment effect of hepatic artery therapy with DEBIRI in combination with an
oxaliplatin-containing regimen for first-line treatment in
patients with liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer.
In patients with liver-dominant disease, we demonstrated
superior 2-, 4- and 6-month response rates (Figs. 1 and 2)
and similar progression-free survival in patients receiving
FOLFOX-DEBIRI and patients receiving FOLFOX
alone. The FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm also demonstrated a
significant improvement in best overall response rates,
regardless of the follow-up time interval, and we believe
that this is important because systemic chemotherapy
alone may have a slower time to an optimal response in
comparison with DEBIRI. Even with this combination of
hepatic artery therapy (DEBIRI), we did not see any type
of augmentation of adverse events or severe adverse events
and, more importantly, did not see any type of augmentation of chemotherapy-associated adverse events (Table 4).
These similar adverse events were expected from our previous phase 1 clinical evaluation, which demonstrated
minimal to nonexistent systemic exposure to irinotecan
when it was administered through drug-eluting bead technology via the hepatic artery.8
The improvement in response rates did correlate with
a significant improvement in downsizing to resection in the
3656

FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm (35%) versus the FOLFOX-alone
control arm (6%; P 5 .05). There were 2 main reasons for
the downsizing to resection in this group of patients. The
first indication occurred when extrahepatic disease, which
was the reason that the patient was unresectable at enrollment, was eradicated or disappeared. The second indication
occurred with the complete response of contralateral liver
lesions, which had caused the patient to be unresectable at
enrollment. Similarly, in that subset of patients who were
downsized to resection, a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival after resection was also seen
with the FOLFOX-DEBIRI combination in comparison
with the control arm.
These results for the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm, compared with previously published results for the use of
conventional chemoembolization, demonstrate a significant improvement in the response rate, progression-free
survival, and overall survival in comparison with these
historical controls.13,14,17 Sanz-Altamira et al14 reported
an overall median survival of 10 months from the date of
first chemoembolization. The 1 unique difference in this
study was the use of concurrent systemic chemotherapy,
which historically has not been used when hepatic artery
therapy is being evaluated. These preliminary results also
demonstrate similar tolerance, adverse event rates,
progression-free survival, and downsizing to surgical
resection in patients who were treated with combination
systemic chemotherapy and hepatic artery infused
pumps.18 The potential advantage of using DEBIRI is
that this spares the patient a surgical procedure, which is

required for hepatic artery infused pumps. However, the
current study does not allow us to make any type of direct
comparison to other liver-directed therapies.
Our study was also unique in the ability to concurrently use systemic chemotherapy and regional
hepatic-directed therapy and not need to rely on alternating therapy, as has been reported in the past.19 This
concurrent use, we believe, is essential, especially for the
treatment of liver-dominant disease, and this was demonstrated by acceptable and similar extrahepatic progressionfree survival in the 2 groups in this study: a median of 13.7
months (range, 9-38 months) for the treatment group and
a median of 16 months (range, 10-38 months) for the control group (P 5 .35). This was surprising because of the
significantly higher percentage of extrahepatic disease at
the time of enrollment in the treatment group (55% vs
31% in the control group; P 5 .046). These results suggest
synergistic activity and benefits from the addition of fulldose, active systemic chemotherapy to regional hepatic artery therapy when we consider the similar proportion of
patients developing extrahepatic progression in comparison with the control arm. However, because this study was
a phase 2 evaluation, the confirmation of these results with
larger numbers of patients in a prospective trial will be
required to ascertain a benefit from the addition of systemic chemotherapy. A challenge with concurrent use can
be the scheduling of interventional radiology and systemic
chemotherapy administration, as demonstrated in our
study, which required a subset of the patients to be treated
outside the 7-day window (61 day). Our study does
appear to demonstrate an improvement in the time to progression and overall survival in comparison with previously
published hepatic conventional chemoembolization studies in colorectal cancer that did not use systemic chemotherapy.13,14 However, whether the activity of concurrent
systemic chemotherapy and hepatic artery therapy delays
the progression of extrahepatic metastases or whether
localized liver-directed therapy with systemic therapy
reduces the intrahepatic progression of disease cannot be
definitively proven in this phase 2 trial. Nevertheless, the
signal for prolonged intrahepatic disease control does produce enthusiasm for a larger study evaluation.
Key to any trial that involves a combination of local
therapy and systemic therapy is the ability to deliver both
therapies easily without accentuating the toxicity of either
therapy. We were able to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of the FOLFOX-DEBIRI treatment, with minimal
dose delays and similar dose delivery of the systemic
chemotherapy in the 2 arms (Table 3). More importantly,
we did not see an accentuation of systemic therapy–related
Cancer

adverse events or severe adverse events in either arm, and
this demonstrated that localized DEBIRI therapy does
not induce systemic toxicity in a majority of patients and,
more importantly, does not induce an accentuation of
liver toxicity in patients undergoing systemic FOLFOX
and concurrent DEBIRI delivered with this technique.
It has been well established and proven that the evaluation of the radiographic response by the standard
RECIST criteria is not adequate for liver-directed therapy
chemoembolization studies.20,21 For these well-established
reasons, we chose to evaluate responses according to both
the modified RECIST criteria22-24 and Choi’s criteria.16,25
These response criteria have been used before in a recent
prospective randomized control trial of sorafenib and doxorubicin drug-eluting beads.26
These modified RECIST criteria, which define a
response as a loss of arterial enhancement from the baseline, have been similarly used in studies of hepatic artery
therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer.21,27-29 Continued
high-quality triphasic computed tomography scanning is
necessary for all follow-up to evaluate the maximal effect
on the tumor volume because the evolution of these
lesions continues to demonstrate sharper demargination
and diminishing size over time.
Future prospective randomized clinical trials of hepatic artery therapy will continue to be a challenge because
of the intrinsic clinical heterogeneity of patients with hepatic tumors, which is based on 1) the extent of liver
involvement, 2) liver-only tumors versus liver-dominant
tumors, 3) the kRas mutation status, 4) the prior use of
adjuvant therapy (ie, FOLFOX), and 5) established definitions for stopping chemotherapy in patients with unresectable disease. However, future trials are needed with
primary endpoints of downsizing to possible resection,
improvements in the quality of life, and overall survival.
We have established a simplified DEBIRI technique,
which does not require these procedures to be performed
in specialized centers but can be performed in both community and academic facilities safely and effectively.30,31
The procedure-associated morbidities with DEBIRI have
been well established and can be avoided with these types
of technical modifications, which differ from conventional transarterial chemoembolization. We have validated a generally less technically complex DEBIRI
procedure that does not require hospitalization, uses a
minimal percentage of patient controlled anesthesia
(PCA), and, therefore, represents a less toxic, less expensive, and more convenient treatment alternative to other
regional hepatic artery therapies.

In conclusion, we believe that simultaneous mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab and DEBIRI via the hepatic artery is safe, does not cause chemotherapy delivery delays,
and does not increase chemotherapy toxicity. Simultaneous use of FOLFOX and DEBIRI leads to improved overall response rates, improved hepatic progression-free
survival, and more durable overall progression-free survival in patients downsized to resection.
