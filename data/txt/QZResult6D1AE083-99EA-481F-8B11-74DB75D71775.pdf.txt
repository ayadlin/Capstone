Abstract
Adriamycin (ADM) has been effective against many types of solid tumors in clinical applications. However,
its use is limited because of systemic toxicities, primarily cardiotoxicity, and multidrug resistance. In this
study, a new active receptor-mediated complex, ADM conjugated with 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose and
succinic acid (2DG–SUC–ADM), was designed to target tumor cells through glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1).
MTT assay and confocal images showed that the complex had better inhibition rate to tumor cells and low
toxicity to normal cells. Most importantly, the complex displayed a potential to reverse overcome multidrug
resistance in cancer cells, with more complex transported into the nucleus of tumor cells. Our in vivo
experiments also showed that this new complex could signiﬁcantly decrease organ toxicity and enhance the
antitumor efﬁcacy compared with free ADM, indicating a promising drug of 2DG–SUC–ADM for targeted
cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 73(4); 1362–73. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Anticancer drugs have been used extensively in cancer
therapy over the past 6 decades (1). Most anticancer drugs
are small molecules that penetrate into cells by diffusion (2, 3).
One of their main drawbacks is that these therapeutic agents
cannot speciﬁcally target tumor cells within the pathologic
sites, which both weakens their anticancer effects and results
in serious toxic and side effects (4–7). Adriamycin (ADM) has
been effective against many types of solid malignant tumors.
However, because of its nontargeting nature, ADM induces
severe side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and
baldness, in particularly on the heart and gastrointestinal tract.
In addition, multidrug resistance of ADM also limits its clinical
applications. To overcome these limitations, loading ADM into
macromolecular carriers, such as iron oxide, carboxymethylpullulan, poly (L-lysine citramide), and polyethylene glycol has
attracted much attention (8–11). Such delivery systems can

improve ADM anticancer activity and decrease its side effects.
However, the drug-loading efﬁciency of these conjugates is low
and the ADM release is usually unsatisfactory (12). A promising
approach to increase drug efﬁciency and selectivity is to
covalently conjugate ADM to a targeting ligand that can
speciﬁcally bind to the tumor cells and form an ADM prodrug
(13–15). According to the design concept of drugs, the primary
amino group, which is far from the anticancer active anthracence ring of ADM molecule, has higher reactivity than the 13carboxyl group, 3-amino group, a-H, and hydroxyl group. The
modiﬁcation of the primary amino group with other molecules
will not affect the antitumor ability of ADM. Thus, it is feasible
to covalently bind the amino group with carboxyl groups to
form a stable amide bond. In addition, studies have shown that
modiﬁcation of the primary amino group could greatly reduce
the cardiotoxicity, which is one of the main objectives to
modify ADM (16).
Glucose, which plays an important role in human physiology, is an indispensable energy source in the metabolic process.
Malignant tumors show an elevated glycolytic rate and a highglucose demand, even under aerobic conditions (17, 18). The
uptake of glucose is through glucose transporters (GLUT). Of
these transporters, GLUT1 is reported to be the main mediator
of glucose uptake (19). Consequently, the increased demand for
glucose to fuel energy production in tumors translates to
elevated expression and activity of GLUT1, which can be
exploited as targeting ligand for drugs (20). Studies show that
the glucose analog, 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) is the
formation of 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase phophorylation (21–24), which can be recognized and transported
into the cells by GLUT1 on the cell membrane. These ﬁndings
have been extensively exploited in preclinical and clinical
imaging for tumor diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of therapeutic response (25–29). Especially, using radiolabeled 2ﬂuoro-2-deoxyglucose (18FDG) as a targeting ligand to form

2DG-Based Adriamycin Complex

drugs has been studied (30–32). However, up to now, 2DGbased prodrugs have not been carefully studied.
In this study, we developed a new active receptor-mediated
complex, by conjugating adriamycin with 2-amino-2-deoxy-Dglucose and succinic acid (2DG–SUC–ADM), which modiﬁed
the primary amine group with 2DG using succinic anhydride as
reaction linkage. It was designed to target tumor cells through
GLUT1.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Adriamycin hydrochloride (ADMHCl, MW 579.99) was purchased from Beijing Huafenglianbo Technology CO. LTD. D(þ)-Glucosamine hydrochloride (MW 164.16), succinic anhydride (SUC, MW 100.07), quercetin (MW 302.23), 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI,
MW 191.07), and N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS, MW 115.08)
were from Aladdin. All reagents and solvents were of analytic or
HPLC grade and were used without further puriﬁcation.
RPMI-1640, 3-(4,5-dimethylthialzol-a-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin,
streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from commercial sources.
Synthesis of 2DG–SUC–ADM
Synthesis of 2-(3-carboxyl-1-oxopropyl) amino-2-dexoy-Dglucose (2DG–SUC). 2-(3-Carboxyl-1-oxopropyl)amino-2dexoy-D-glucose was synthesized as shown in Fig. 1A. Triethylamine (3.40 mL) and water (7.5 mL) were added in a ﬂask
containing D-(þ)-glucosamine hydrochloride (5.00 mg, 2.32
mmol). Acetone solution of succinic anhydride (SUC, 2.50 g)
was subsequently added dropwise to the mixture and stirred
for 4 hours. The product was collected by ﬁltration, washed
with ethanol and diethyl ether. The puriﬁed 2DG–SUC was
dried in vacuum and obtained as white solid powder (4.68 g)
with a 72% yield.
Synthesis of 2DG–SUC–ADM. The complex 2DG–SUC–
ADM was synthesized in 2 steps, as shown in Fig. 1A. First,
2DG–SUC (7.00 mg) was activated 3 hours by NHS (4.33 mg)
and EDCI (6.98 mg) to obtain solution A. Second, ADMHCl
(10.00 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (2.0 mL) at 37 C
to form solution B. Afterward, solution B was added in
solution A and the pH was adjusted to 7.5. The mixture
was stirred for 48 hours in the dark. The product was
obtained by lyophilization and puriﬁed by silica gel column
chromatography.
Characterization of 2DG–SUC–ADM
Q-TOF Micro Mass Spectrometer (Waters) and Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (BRUKER) were used to
conﬁrm the successful synthesis of 2DG–SUC–ADM. UV-Vis
absorption spectra of samples were acquired using a 754-PC
spectrophotometer at room temperature.
In vitro studies
Cell culture. Tumor cells (MCF-7, Bel-7402, HepG2, MDAMB-231, U87MG, HELF, SKOV3, and S180) and normal cell
HELF were purchased from American Type Culture Collection

www.aacrjournals.org

and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
(v/v) calf serum, penicillin (100 U/mL), and (100 mg/mL)
streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
In vitro tumor-targeting ability of 2DG–SUC–ADM. Five
tumor cell lines (MCF-7, HepG2, Bel-7402, MDA-MB-231, and
SKOV3) were used for GLUT1 expression evaluation by reverse
transcriptase PCR (sense: 50 -TGCTCATCAACCGCAACGA-30 ,
antisense: 50 -CACCACAAACAGCGACA CG-30 ).
To determine the tumor-targeting ability of 2DG–SUC–
ADM to tumor cells, the uptake of 2DG–SUC–ADM and
ADM by tumor cells were compared on the mentioned
different tumor cell lines. Brieﬂy, different cells were respectively seeded in the confocal dishes and incubated for 24
hours. Then, cells were incubated in a 200-mL solution of
2DG–SUC–ADM or ADM for 0.5 hours. After washing with
PBS, the cells were imaged by a laser confocal microscope
(Olympus FV1100).
To conﬁrm the GLUT1 receptor mediation, in vitro receptor
blocking experiments with free 2DG or a GLUT1-inhibitor,
quercetin, were conducted on HepG2 cells. After cultured, the
HepG2 cells at 37 C for 24 hours, 2DG (25 or 50 mmol/L) or
quercetin (25 or 50 mmol/L) was preliminarily added to the
cells for 30-minute incubation. Subsequently, 2DG–SUC–ADM
was added to the dishes and cultured for another 30 minutes.
After washing with PBS, the cells were imaged using laser
confocal microscopy.
In vitro therapeutic efﬁcacy. Cell viability assays were
carried out to evaluate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of 2DG–SUC–
ADM in cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and HepG-2) and normal
cells (HELF). ADM-resistance was evaluated in ADM-sensitive
and ADM-resistant MCF-7 cells. After 24-hour cultivation,
2DG–SUC–ADM or free ADM of different concentrations
(1.625, 3.25, 6.5, 13, 26, and 52 nmol/mL) were added into the
cells of the 96 wells (n ¼ 6) and incubated for 48 hours. Then
MTT solution (20 mL; 5 mg/mL) was added into each well. The
absorbance of the solution in each well was measured at 570
nm with a multiwell plate reader.
Animal experiments
Animal models. All animal experiments were carried out
in compliance with the Animal Management Rules of the
Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China.
MCF-7, SKOV3, and S180 cells (5  106) were subcutaneously
injected into the upper right axillary fossa in the nude mice or
Kunming mice (Charles River Laboratories, n ¼ 10 per group).
As the tumors grew up to a diameter of 0.3  0.4 cm, the mice
were used for NIR imaging and treatment.
In vivo dynamics and targeting ability of 2DG–ICG–Der01. To investigate the dynamic distribution and tumortargeting ability of 2DG–SUC–ADM in nude mice, we
replaced the ADM in 2DG–SUC–ADM with an organic dye
ICG-Der-01 to form 2DG–ICG–Der-01 for NIR imaging. The
2DG–ICG–Der-01 was intravenously administrated into the
subject mice and the ﬂuorescence images of the mice were
acquired by our NIR imaging system (33, 34) at different time
points postinjection. The tumor/normal tissue ratio (T/N
ratio) was analyzed and compared by using the region of

targeting ability of 2DG–ICG–Der-01 is attributed to the
GLUT1 mediation, the in vitro and in vivo blocking experiments were conducted. First, in vitro receptor blocking
experiments with free 2DG or GLUT1-inhibitor quercetin
(35) were conducted in HepG2 tumor cells. The methods are
the same as described earlier, except that the HepG2 cells
were cultured in 6-well plates and the ﬂuorescence images
were acquired using a NIR imaging system, as our confocal
microscope is not equipped with NIR ﬂuorescence detector.
For the in vivo blocking study, a mixture of 50 mg/kg 2DG (or
5 mg/kg quercetin) and 10 nmol/L 2DG–ICG-Der–01 was
injected into the tumor-bearing mice (n ¼ 5) and the
ﬂuorescence images were acquired using the NIR imaging
system. Data are expressed as means  SD (n ¼ 5).

In vivo antitumor efﬁcacy of 2DG–SUC–ADM. Kunming
mice-bearing S180 and nude mice-bearing SKOV3 tumors were
randomly assigned into 3 groups (n ¼ 6 per group). The mice in
each group were treated every other day for 10 days via tail vein
injection with different solutions (0.2 mL): (A) Saline (control
group); (B) ADM solution (6 mg/kg); (C) 2DG–SUC–ADM
solution (containing ADM 6 mg/kg). The therapeutic efﬁcacies
and systematic toxicities of 2DG–SUC–ADM on these tumorbearing mice were assessed by measuring tumor volume and
body weight of each mouse every day.
Histology examination. To further investigate the side
effects of 2DG–SUC–ADM on other organs, histology analysis
of hearts and kidneys of the treated mice was conducted. The
sliced organs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and
examined under a microscope.

Results
Identiﬁcation and characterization of 2DG–SUC–ADM
2DG–SUC–ADM was synthesized following the procedure as
illustrated in Fig. 1A. The absorption and ﬂuorescence spectra
of 2DG–SUC–ADM, free ADM, and 2DG were obtained. As
shown in Fig. 1B, the absorption peaks of 2DG–SUC–ADM
remained almost the same as that of free ADM after the
conjugation of ADM and 2DG. As shown in Fig. 1C, an obvious
blue shift of the maximum emission peak of 2DG–SUC–ADM
(550 nm) was observed compared with the maximum emission peak of free ADM ( 600 nm), possibly due to the fact that
the combination had increased the transition energy of the
chromophores of ADM.
The successful conjugation of 2DG and ADM was further
evidenced by mass spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR). Mass spectrum (Fig. 1D) indicates that the molecular

weight (MW) of 2DG–SUC–ADM is 804.1, whereas the calculated MW is 804 based on its molecular structure
(C37H44N2O18). The peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum (D2O,
500 MHz) of 2DG–SUC–ADM (Fig. 1E) are assigned as follows.

(m, 6H), 2.92 (1H, d, J ¼ 17.9 Hz), 2.67 (t, 2H, J ¼ 6.6 Hz), 2.62 (t,
2H, J ¼ 7.4 Hz), 2.61 (1H, d, J ¼ 18.4 Hz), 2.71(2H, m), 2.07 (3H,
m), and 1.34 (3H, d, J ¼ 6.5 Hz).
In vitro tumor-targeting ability
To assess the correlation between GLUT1 and the targeting ability of 2DG–SUC–ADM, tumor cells (MCF-7, HepG2,
SKOV3, Bel-7402, and MDA-MB-231) with different GLUT1
expression levels were investigated (Fig. 2A and B). The
GLUT1 expression on the different cancer cells was found
to decrease in the following order: HepG2>MDA-MB231>Bel-7402>SKOV3>MCF-7.
To investigate the tumor-targeting ability of 2DG–SUC–
ADM, confocal images were acquired on MCF-7 cells incubated
with free ADM or 2DG–SUC–ADM, as shown in Fig. 2, the

ﬂuorescence intensity from the cells incubated with 2DG–
SUC–ADM is much higher than that of free ADM. In addition,
the merged ﬂuorescence images indicate that 2DG–SUC–ADM
and ADM are mainly within the cytoplasm region rather than
in nuclei after 5-minute incubation, which can be clearly
observed by staining the cell nuclei with 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI). The enhanced cellular uptake of 2DG–
SUC–ADM is a clear evidence of its tumor-targeting ability.
The speciﬁcity of 2DG–SUC–ADM uptake via GLUTs was
conducted and displayed in Fig. 2E–I. As shown in the ﬁgures,
the uptake of 2DG–SUC–ADM was signiﬁcantly inhibited by
2DG (25 or 50 mmol/L) or quercetin (25 or 50 mmol/L) in the
HepG2 cells. The corresponding mean ﬂuorescence intensity of
the HepG2 cells incubated with 2DG–SUC–ADM in the
absence and presence of 2DG or quercetin, as shown in Fig.
2J, further indicated that the uptake of 2DG–SUC–ADM was
mostly mediated by GLUTs.
In vitro antitumor activity of 2DG–SUC–ADM
To evaluate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of 2DG–SUC–ADM and
its potential cytotoxicity, cell viability assays were carried out
in cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and HepG-2) and normal cells
(HELF). The results in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1A
indicated that 2DG–SUC–ADM effectively reduced the viability
of cancer cells while having little cytotoxicity in normal cells
compared with free ADM. In addition, free 2DG ligand had no
negative effect on cell growth in either cancerous or normal
cells. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, 2DG–SUC–ADM had a higher
therapeutic efﬁcacy for cancer cells than free ADM. Supplementary Fig. S1A shows that there is a signiﬁcantly decrease in
cell viability of ADM-treated HELF cells, due to the high
cytotoxicity of nontargeting ADM. While, 2DG–SUC–ADM has
negligible cytotoxicity in HELF normal cells. Moreover, we
used 2DG–SUC–ADM and free ADM to treat ADM-sensitive
MCF-7 cells and ADM-resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/ADR) to
investigate drug resistance. Figure 3C shows that 2DG–SUC–
ADM and free ADM have similar antitumor effect on the ADMsensitive MCF-7 cells. Signiﬁcant drug resistance was observed
in MCF-7/ADR cells treated by free ADM, as shown in Fig. 3D.
However, 2DG–SUC–ADM showed high antitumor efﬁcacy on
MCF-7/ADR cells, indicating that 2DG–SUC–ADM has the
potential to reverse overcome ADM-resistance in drug-resistant MCF-7 cell lines.
Figure 4 displays the cellular uptake of 2DG–SUC–ADM or
free ADM in HepG2 cells at different time points. After
incubation with each drug for 5 minute, ﬂuorescence emission of ADM was observed, not only from the cytoplasm but
also from cell nuclei. Owing to the tumor-targeting ability of
2DG ligand to GLUT1, 2DG–SUC–ADM is ﬁrst accumulated
in the cell membrane and is subsequently transported inside
cells, mainly located in the cytoplasm at 5-minute incubation and gradually entered into the nuclei at 10 minutes. Red
emission of 2DG–SUC–ADM was brighter than that of free
ADM from the cells at the same time point. After incubation
for 10 minutes there are signiﬁcant morphologic differences
between 2DG–SUC–ADM and free ADM-treated cells. The
morphologic characteristics of apoptosis cells, such as cell
shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation were

1366

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

observed after the cells were incubated with 2DG–SUC–
ADM for 10 minutes. Similar results were observed in other
cell lines (Bel-7402, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7) after incubation with ADM and 2DG–SUC–ADM (Supplementary Fig.
S1B–S1D). Figure 4B shows the mean ﬂuorescence intensities of 2DG–SUC–ADM and ADM in various tumor cells
detected at different time points, with obvious higher ﬂuorescence in the 2DG–SUC–ADM–treated cells than that of
ADM treated. The mean ﬂuorescence emission intensities
of 2DG–SUC–ADM–treated cells follows the order of
HepG2>MDA-MB-231Bel7402>MCF7, which is consistent
with the GLUT1 expression (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover, tumor
cells were dead after treatment with 2DG–SUC–ADM for 20
minutes and the ﬂuorescence emission from the cells disappeared. However, the mean ﬂuorescence emission from
different tumor cells treated by free ADM gradually
increased and then disappeared after 30-minute incubation.
To assess the antitumor efﬁcacy and antidrug resistance of
2DG–SUC–ADM, MCF-7/ADR cells were treated with 2DG–
SUC–ADM or free ADM. As shown in Fig. 5A, emission from
MCF-7/ADR cells incubated with 2DG–SUC–ADM was
observed, primarily due to the tumor-targeting capacity of the
prodrug with the 2DG ligand. The ﬂuorescence emission from
2DG–SUC–ADM–treated cells (both ADM sensitive and ADM
resistant) was much higher than that from free ADM-treated
cells (Fig. 5B), which suggests that 2DG–SUC–ADM has the
potential to prevent overcome ADM-resistance in treating
multidrug-resistant tumor cells.
On the basis of cell viability assays, 2DG–SUC–ADM has
prominent antitumor effect on MCF-7 cells at the dose of 12
mmol/L. HELF cells were treated with the same concentration
of the prodrug to investigate its potential cytotoxicity to
normal cells. Supplementary Fig. S1E shows no obvious morphologic changes in the HELF cells. However, MCF-7 cells with
the same treatment showed signiﬁcant characteristics of
apoptosis (Fig. 5C). These results show that 2DG–SUC–ADM
has a negligible side effect on normal cells and a high speciﬁcity
for tumor cells.
In vivo dynamic distribution and tumor-targeting ability
of 2DG–ICG–Der-01
Before studying in vivo tumor-targeting ability of 2DG, we
veriﬁed that 2DG–ICG–Der-01 was transported into cells in the
same manner as 2DG–SUC–ADM using in vitro receptor
blocking experiments. Results shown in Fig. 6A and B showed
that the ﬂuorescence intensity in cells incubated with 2DG–
ICG–Der-01 with blocking dose of 2DG or quercetin were much
weaker than that of 2DG–ICG–Der-01 without blocking substance, which conﬁrmed that the uptake of 2DG–ICG–Der-01
was mediated by GLUT.
In vivo dynamic processes of 2DG–ICG–Der-01 were shown
in Supplementary Fig. S2A. 2DG–ICG–Der-01 was quickly
spread in the whole body at about 30-minute postinjection
and accumulated in the liver at 6-hour postinjection. After 24
hours, it was mostly cleared from the body. To investigate the
tumor-targeting ability of 2DG ligand, nude mice-bearing
MCF-7/estradiol or U87MG tumors that overexpress GLUT1
were used. Fluorescence images at different time points after

administration of 2DG–ICG–Der-01 are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2B and Fig. 6C. 2DG–ICG–Der-01 initially was spread
in the whole animal after 30 minutes. The tumor sites were
identiﬁable at 2-hour postinjection and the probe was gradually accumulated in the tumor sites. Strong ﬂuorescence
emission from the tumors was observed even at 48-h
postinjection.
To further conﬁrm the in vivo tumor-targeting ability of
2DG–SUC–ADM, block experiments were conducted using
nude mice-bearing HepG2 tumors. As shown in Fig. 6C3 and
C4, free 2DG or quercetin successfully reduced tumor accumulation of 2DG–ICG–Der-01. Tumor contrast as quantiﬁed
by ROI analysis of optical imaging shown in Fig. 6D indicated
that the Tumor/Normal Tissue ratio was reduced from 3.8 
0.27 to 1.72  0.14 and 2.03  0.20 for 2DG–ICG–Der-01 with
free 2DG and quercetin, respectively.
In vivo antitumor therapeutic efﬁcacy of 2DG–SUC–ADM
In vivo antitumor efﬁcacy of 2DG–SUC–ADM was evaluated
in mice-bearing S180 and SKOV3 tumors by measuring the
tumor growth rate and the body weight of the mice. As shown

www.aacrjournals.org

in Fig. 7A and D, the tumors of saline-treated mice grew faster
than that of the free ADM or 2DG–SUC–ADM–treated mice. It
is noted that the growth of S180 tumor is inhibited with a rate
of 64.6% after the administration of 2DG–SUC–ADM, which is
higher than that of free ADM (about 50%). The inhibition rate of
2DG–SUC–ADM (68.8%)-treated SKOV3 tumor is about 21%
higher than that of ADM-treated tumor (47.1%).
Furthermore, the body weight of mice-bearing S180 tumors
in 2DG–SUC–ADM and saline-treated groups gradually
increased during the treatment period (Fig. 7B). However, a
signiﬁcant decrease of body weight (10 g) in the free ADMtreated group was observed at the end of the treatment period.
Body weight of ADM-treated mice-bearing SKOV3 tumors
reduced dramatically and all mice in this group died within
17 days (Fig. 7E), whereas 2DG–SUC–ADM–treated mice only
slightly reduced. The 22-day survival rates of mice in the 2DG–
SUC–ADM and free ADM groups were 67%, whereas the
survival rate of the control group drastically decreased to
10% (Fig. 7C).
Heart and kidney are the main organs affected by free ADM.

Histologic examination on hearts and kidneys from mice
treated by 2DG–SUC–ADM showed negligible side effects.
These results indicate that although the survival rates of
2DG–SUC–ADM and free ADM groups are the same, the
toxicity and drug resistance of 2DG–SUC–ADM is far superior
to free ADM.

Discussion
Despite the hope and promises of ADM as an effective
anthracycline for cancer therapy, serious drawbacks hamper
ADM's clinical usefulness. In particular, its primary amine
group has induced irreversible cardiotoxicity. Modiﬁcation to
this primary amine group has been reported to reduce its
toxicity on cardiovasculature (36). In addition, multidrug
resistance induced by frequent use of ADM is another problem
that signiﬁcantly limits its clinical application. To overcome
these obstacles, we developed a new active receptor-mediated
complex, 2DG–SUC–ADM, which modiﬁed the primary amine

www.aacrjournals.org

group with 2DG using SUC as reaction linkage. The synthesized
complex in this study exhibited signiﬁcantly high tumor-targeting capability, high anticancer efﬁciency, as well as reduced
ADM resistance.
The successful synthesis of 2DG–SUC–ADM was conﬁrmed by the absorption and ﬂuorescence spectra, mass
spectrum, NMR, and FTIR (Fig. 1B–E). Previously, studies
have shown that because 2DG lacks a hydroxyl group in the 2
position, after transported into the cells, subsequent isomerization by the next enzyme in the metabolic pathway is
precluded, thereby inhibiting further metabolism of the 2deoxyglucose-6-phosphate and leading to intracellular
retention of the phosphorylated molecule. Our study has
shown that 2DG-based probes had high selectivity as well as
high accumulation and retention rates in tumors (37), with
the targeting ability corresponding to the GLUT1 expression
levels in cancer cells (Figs. 2A and B and 4B). In vitro tumortargeting ability of 2DG–SUC–ADM was studied by ﬂuorescence imaging of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2C and D) and HELF cells
(data not shown) incubated with free ADM or 2DG–SUC–
ADM. The results using MCF-7 cells showed that 2DG–SUC–
ADM was translocated into the cytoplasm after incubation
of 5 minutes, whereas only a very low level of free ADM was
observed inside the cells. In contrast, the uptake of ADM in
HELF cells was higher than that of 2DG–SUC–ADM, due to
the fact that the uptake of free ADM was mainly through
molecular diffusion but the uptake of 2DG–SUC–ADM was
mostly mediated by GLUT1. In vitro blocking and inhibition
results using 2DG or quercetin (Fig. 2E–I), showed successful
inhibition of 2DG–SUC–ADM uptake, conﬁrmed the uptake
of 2DG–SUC–ADM was through GLUTs. These results further support that the GLUT1 is involved in the accelerated
glucose uptake in tumors. It could be an important player in
several stages of cancer progression. The high tumor-targeting ability of the 2DG-based complex has also been shown in
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 6). In vitro and in vivo targeting
experiments indicated that 2DG-based complex had great
potential for targeted cancer therapy.
The toxic side effect of ADM is an obstacle in clinical
applications. In this study, MTT assay was conducted to
evaluate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of ADM in the 2DG-based
complex on cancer cells and its potential toxicity to normal
cells. The results indicate that 2DG–SUC–ADM has higher
therapeutic efﬁcacy against cancer cells than free ADM (Fig. 3),
showing the selective toxicity of our novel complex construct.
No obvious toxicity to the normal cell (HELF) was observed. In
contrast, ADM showed high cytotoxicity to HELF cells due to
its nontargeting nature. Corresponding to the MTT results, the
confocal images of HepG2 cells (Fig. 4) show that the cell
membrane became round and shed off, indicating the inhibition of HepG2 cancer cells by 2DG–SUC–ADM. On the contrary, the morphology of HELF cells had no obvious change
under 2DG–SUC–ADM treatment, further conﬁrming that the
complex is relatively nontoxic to normal cells. Moreover,
histologic studies on animal hearts and kidneys showed that
the 2DG–SUC–ADM did not induce noticeable toxicity, as
shown in Fig. 7F. The histologic results are consistent with
our in vitro results.

Multidrug resistance of ADM is another key issue that
hampers its clinical application. We investigated the inhibition rates of multidrug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells and
drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells using 2DG–SUC–ADM. Results
in Fig. 3C and D showed that 2DG–SUC–ADM inhibited cell
growth in both cell lines, with higher anticancer efﬁciency
than free ADM. After being modiﬁed with 2DG, the complex
has targeted the tumor cells and to a certain degree escaped
the efﬂuxing of P-glycoprotein, which is the molecular
alteration found to be most consistently associated with
the MDR phenotype and has been correlated with the degree
of resistance (38). Thus, special conjugation of ADM to 2DG
resulted in its increased anticancer efﬁciency. Confocal

1370

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

images of MCF-7/ADR and drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells incubated with free ADM or 2DG–SUC–ADM show a higher level
of 2DG–SUC–ADM uptake than that of free ADM after the
same incubation time (Fig. 5A and B), which conﬁrmed the
reduction of drug resistance by 2DG–SUC–ADM. It should
be noted that despite the fact that the mean ﬂuorescence
emission intensity of 2DG–SUC–ADM in MCF-7/ADR cells is
much lower than that in drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A
and B), the intensity ratio of 2DG–SUC–ADM to free ADM is
much higher in MCF-7/ADR cells (9.6) than that in MCF-7
cells (6.2). These results have shown that 2DG–SUC–ADM
had the potential to prevent ADM resistance in treating
multidrug-resistant tumor cells.

The antitumor efﬁciency of 2DG–SUC–ADM was conﬁrmed
both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro study has shown that 2DG–
SUC–ADM had a higher tumor cell inhibition rate compared
with the free ADM. The cellular uptake and apoptosis-inducing
effect of 2DG–SUC–ADM was conducted by confocal microscopy. After 5-minute incubation, 2DG–SUC–ADM was mostly
accumulated on the cell membrane, and the ﬂuorescence
emission intensity was much higher than that of ADM (Fig.
4B). However, after 10-minute incubation, all the complex was
translocated to the cell nuclei, resulting in cell apoptosis (Fig.
4A and Supplementary Fig. S1B–S1D). The impressive therapeutic efﬁcacy of the complex may be due to the fact that 2DG–
SUC–ADM was able to deliver more drugs to the tumor site by
glucose uptake. However, the timing of apoptosis of different
cancer cells varied, mainly due to different expressions of
GLUT1.
The in vivo study indicated that the anticancer effect of
2DG–SUC–ADM was signiﬁcantly greater than that of free
ADM. Furthermore, mice treated with 2DG–SUC–ADM
showed an increase in body weight, whereas mice treated with
free ADM exhibited a signiﬁcant weight loss, as shown in (Fig.
7B and D). It should be noted that there is a signiﬁcant
difference of body weight change between mice-bearing
S180 tumors and SKOV3 tumors, especially in the ADM group.
It could be due to the differences in the animal types. The mice

www.aacrjournals.org

in the SKOV3 group were nude mice with immunodeﬁciency,
which may have less resistance to toxic drug compared with
the immune competent Kunming mice in the S180 group.
Besides, GLUT1 expression in SKOV3 nude mice was higher
than that in S180 mice, and the treatment outcomes were
better in SKOV3 mice, which corresponded to the changes of
tumor volume in Fig. 7A and D. The body weight change may
also be correlated with other reasons such as age, which need
to be further investigated. These results have shown that the
2DG–SUC–ADM greatly reduced the systemic toxicity and
enhanced the antitumor activity of ADM.
In this article, we have conducted in vitro and in vivo studies
of 2DG–SUC–ADM anticancer capability to show the proof of
concept. Before applying this compound for human trials,
numerous experiments must be carried out. For instance, we
need to investigate the formulation of this compound for
appropriate administration and to further study the pharmacokinetics in different animals. We also need in the future to
conjugate this novel compound with speciﬁc antibodies to
improve its targeting efﬁciency. Dose limitation, protein binding, and other related issues will also need to be investigated.

Conclusion
2DG–SUC–ADM increased tumor-targeting capability of
ADM through glucose uptake. It had much lower toxicity to

normal cells, and a potential reversal of multidrug resistance in
cancer cells. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that 2DG–
SUC–ADM induced a higher level of cancer cell apoptosis and
higher inhibition rates in MCF-7 and HepG2 tumors than free
ADM. Our results indicated that the complex could signiﬁcantly decrease toxicity to normal cells and vital organs
compared with free ADM. The 2DG–SUC–ADM could become
a promising drug for targeted cancer therapy.
