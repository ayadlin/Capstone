Abstract
The proto-oncogene MET is aberrantly activated via overexpression or mutation in numerous cancers, making
it a prime anticancer molecular target. However, the clinical success of MET-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI) has been limited due, in part, to mutations in the MET kinase domain that confer therapeutic resistance.
Circumventing this problem remains a key challenge to improving durable responses in patients receiving METtargeted therapy. MET is an HSP90-dependent kinase, and in this report we show that HSP90 preferentially
interacts with and stabilizes activated MET, regardless of whether the activation is ligand-dependent or is a
consequence of kinase domain mutation. In contrast, many MET-TKI show a preference for the inactive form of
the kinase, and activating mutations in MET can confer resistance. Combining the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib
with the MET-TKI crizotinib achieves synergistic inhibition of MET, its downstream signaling pathways, and
tumor growth in both TKI-sensitive and -resistant MET-driven tumor models. These data suggest that inclusion
of an HSP90 inhibitor can partially restore TKI sensitivity to previously resistant MET mutants, and they provide
the foundation for clinical evaluation of this therapeutic combination in patients with MET-driven cancers.

Introduction
The proto-oncogene product MET is a receptor tyrosine
kinase whose ligand is the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter
factor (HGF/SF). HGF binding to MET induces receptor
dimerization and trans-phosphorylation, and promotes activation of several signaling networks including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT and mitogen-activated protein/
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) pathways (1).
Activating point mutations in the MET kinase domain are
implicated in the etiology of hereditary papillary renal
carcinoma and have also been detected in sporadic papillary
renal carcinoma, lung cancer, and gastric cancer (2–5).
Furthermore, ampliﬁcation of the MET gene locus has been
detected in patients with gastric and metastatic colorectal

cancers (6, 7). Cell lines engineered to express high levels of
wild-type MET or constitutively active mutant MET display a
proliferative, motogenic, and invasive phenotype, and form
metastatic tumors in nude mice (8–11).
MET is a validated molecular target for cancer therapy, and
MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) represent a promising
treatment modality. Crizotinib, an orally available ATP-competitive and selective small-molecule inhibitor of MET, exhibits
marked antitumor activity in several MET-dependent xenograft models (12). A recent phase 2 study of the dual MET/
VEGFR2 inhibitor foretinib in patients with papillary renal cell
carcinoma reported an overall response rate (using the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0) of
13.5%, and the presence of a germline MET mutation was
highly predictive of a response (13). However, recent studies
suggest that primary (de novo) resistance to TKIs is likely to be
encountered in tumors harboring certain activating MET
mutations. Thus, although crizotinib can inhibit the activity
of most MET mutants, some constitutively active mutants,
including MET-L1213V and -Y1248H, are resistant to this
inhibitor (12, 14). Additional studies have suggested that these
mutations not only mediate primary resistance to MET inhibitors but may also play a role in acquired resistance to METTKI (15–17).
HSP90 is a molecular chaperone whose association is
required for the stability and function of multiple mutated or
overexpressed signaling proteins, including many kinases, that
promote the growth and survival of cancer cells. Small-molecule HSP90 inhibitors cause HSP90 to dissociate from its

HSP90 Inhibition Reverses MET Resistance to Crizotinib

clients, resulting in their destabilization and eventual degradation. HSP90 inhibitors have been validated in numerous
preclinical tumor models, and have shown promising activity
in several clinical trials (18–20).
HSP90 inhibitors have been reported to destabilize MET (21,
22), as well as several MET-activated downstream signaling
proteins, including AKT and RAF (23–25). Based on these
ﬁndings, HSP90 inhibitors are expected to effectively interdict
MET signaling at multiple points to inhibit the proliferation of
MET-driven cancer cells. Indeed, the HSP90 inhibitors ganetespib (STA-9090) and SNX-2112 have each shown potent
activity in several preclinical MET-driven tumor models,
including those resistant to MET-TKI (26, 27). However, a
detailed study of the MET-HSP90 interaction and its role in
supporting MET activation has not been reported, nor has the
possible synergy between HSP90 inhibition and MET-TKI been
rigorously examined.
In the current study, we show that HSP90 interacts preferentially with activated MET, regardless of whether activation
depends on HGF engaging the receptor or is mediated by
kinase domain mutation. Further, we show that the activated
MET fraction is most sensitive to HSP90 inhibition. The HSP90
inhibitor ganetespib displays synergy, both in vitro and in vivo,
with the MET-TKI crizotinib in cells overexpressing wild-type
MET. Unexpectedly, low-dose ganetespib also partially restores crizotinib sensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo, to cells and
tumors expressing TKI-resistant MET mutants. Our ﬁndings
support the use of HSP90 inhibitors to overcome or delay the
initiation of resistance to MET-TKI, and they provide the basis
for clinical evaluation of this combination in patients with
MET-driven cancers.

Materials and Methods

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
These experiments were performed as previously described
(28). Brieﬂy, cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mmol/L
Hepes, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40,
20 mmol/L Na2MoO4, phosphatase, and protease inhibitors.
Immunoprecipitates or cell lysates were resolved by 4% to 20%
SDS–PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and
probed with respective antibodies.
Plasmid constructs
Human MET cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Don Bottaro
(NCI, Bethesda, Maryland). Chimeric mutant MET/EGFR was
generated using PCR and ligated into a pcDNA vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the C-terminal V5 tag. A point mutation
was made by using QuikChange (Stratagene) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells
per well and incubated for 24 hours, followed by addition of
drugs. After 48 hours, MTT solution (Sigma) was added and
plates were incubated at 37 C for 3 hours. The optical density
at 570 nm was determined by a spectrophotometer (Bio-TEK).
The combination index (CI) was calculated by the medianeffect method of Chou and Talalay (29) using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were plated at a density of 3  105 in 10-cm dishes and
incubated for 24 hours, followed by the addition of drugs. After
48 hours, cells were ﬁxed with 70% ethanol for 4 hours at
20 C, and then suspended in a solution containing 0.04%
digitonin. Cells were incubated at 37 C for 1 hour in a solution
containing RNase A (100 mg/mL; Novagen) and propidium
iodide (50 mg/mL), and then analyzed with a FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

Cell lines
MKN45, H1993, and HEK293 cell lines (American Type
Culture Collection) were maintained under 5% CO2 at 37 C
in either RPMI1640 (MKN45, H1993), or Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM; HEK293) supplemented with 10% FBS.
NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing either wild-type or mutant
MET proteins (V1238I, H1112Y, Y1248H, L1213V, M1268T, and
V1110I) were kindly provided by Dr. Laura Schmidt [National
Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, Maryland]. These cells were
cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 0.5 mg/mL G-418.

Colony formation assay
Cells were plated at a density of 1  104 in 60-mm dishes
containing 0.4% top low-melting agarose and 0.5% bottom lowmelting agarose medium, and cultured for 3 weeks. Colonies
with a diameter of more than 0.1 mm were counted in ﬁve
random high-power ﬁelds.

Antibodies and reagents
Antibodies to MET, phospho-Tyr1234/35 MET, Akt, phospho-Ser473 Akt, Erk1/2, phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 Erk1/2
(Cell Signaling Technology), HSP90 (StressGen), V5 (Invitrogen), ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a-tubulin
(Calbiochem) were used for immunoprecipitation and/or
immunoblotting. Geldanamycin was obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI. Ganetespib and
crizotinib were obtained from Synta Pharmaceuticals. Mouse
immunoglobulin G (IgG), MG132, and recombinant human
HGF were purchased from Millipore, Sigma, and R&D Systems, respectively. FuGene6 (Roche) was used for transient
transfection.

Migration and invasion assay
Twelve-well polycarbonate Transwell chambers with 8mm pores (Corning) coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
were used. Cells (1  105) were added to the top well in
serum-free medium with indicated drugs. In the bottom
well, medium with 10% FBS was used as the chemoattractant. After 48 hours, cells on the upper surface of the ﬁlter
were carefully removed with cotton pads. Migrated cells
were ﬁxed in 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with 40 , 6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The invaded cells were
ﬁxed and stained with Diff-Quik Stain kit (Dade Behring).
The number of cells in ﬁve random high-power ﬁelds was
determined.

Animal experiments
Animal experiments and procedures were carried out in
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institutes of Health. To establish tumor xenografts, cells (1  106)
were injected into the ﬂank of female Nu/Nu mice (6 weeks of
age; Taconic). After tumors reached a mean volume of 100
mm3, mice were administered crizotinib in water by oral
gavage or ganetespib in the diluent 10/18 DRD [10% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), 18% Cremophor RH40, 3.6% dextrose in
water] by intraperitoneal injection. Tumor volume was calculated as the product of length  width2  0.5. Fractional tumor
volume (FTV) relative to untreated controls was determined as
described previously (30). On the ﬁnal day of the study, mice
were humanely euthanized, and tumors were resected and
pulverized using a homogenizer (Kinematica). Protein lysates
were subjected to immunoblotting.
Statistical analysis
To determine the statistical signiﬁcance of experimental
data, we used the unpaired Student t test followed by the
Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Data represent the mean  SD. All P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant relative to control, and
designated with an asterisk ( ). Statistical analysis was done
with the JMP software (SAS Institute).

Results
Wild-type MET is an HSP90-dependent kinase
We assessed the interaction of HSP90 and wild-type MET
(wtMET) in the gastric cancer cell line MKN45, which overexpresses wtMET. As shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous HSP90
coprecipitated, albeit weakly, with wtMET. Previous reports by
us and others have suggested that the activated states of some
HSP90-dependent kinases have a greater dependence on
HSP90 (31–33). To determine if this were the case for MET,
we compared the degree of wtMET–HSP90 interaction in the
presence and absence of the MET ligand HGF. Coimmunoprecipitation of HSP90 with MET clearly increased upon HGF
stimulation and correlated with an increased population of
activated (phosphorylated) MET (Fig. 1B). Next, we compared
the sensitivity of total and activated wtMET protein to HSP90
inhibition. Exposure of MKN45 cells to the HSP90 inhibitor
geldanamycin (GA) reduced the steady-state expression of
both total and activated MET protein in a dose- and
time-dependent manner, but the activated MET fraction
was most sensitive to HSP90 inhibition (Fig. 1C). Loss of
MET protein expression occurred much more rapidly in the
presence of geldanamycin than following inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (Supplementary Fig. S1B,
MKN45 panels), supporting the Hsp90-inhibitor–mediated
destabilization of activated MET. Next, we determined
whether HSP90 inhibition promotes wtMET ubiquitination
and degradation by the proteasome, a common fate of most
HSP90 clients deprived of interaction with the chaperone
(34). Cotreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132
reversed the impact of HSP90 inhibition on steady-state
expression of activated MET (Fig. 1D), whereas brief expo-

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

sure of MKN45 cells to geldanamycin increased MET ubiquitination, and this was further enhanced by cotreatment
with a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 1E).
HSP90 preferentially associates with activated MET
These data suggest that HSP90 interacts preferentially
with and stabilizes the activated fraction of MET. In contrast
to wtMET, which requires HGF binding for stimulation of its
kinase activity, MET proteins with speciﬁc mutations in the
kinase domain display constitutive activity in the absence of
HGF. Therefore, we asked whether HSP90 also interacted
robustly with a constitutively active MET mutant. To maintain a similar cell background, we immunoprecipitated MET
from NIH3T3 cells stably expressing either wtMET or the
constitutively active MET mutant Y1248H. HSP90 association with MET-Y1248H was markedly increased compared
with wtMET (in the absence of exogenous HGF), in accordance with the different steady-state activation states of
these MET proteins (Fig. 2A). Next, we compared the sensitivity of wtMET and the constitutively active MET-Y1248H
mutant to geldanamycin. In stably transfected NIH3T3 cells,
we found MET-Y1248H (both activated and total) to be
more sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition compared with wtMET
(Fig. 2B).
Consistent with these data, activated MET-Y1248H is
robustly protected from geldanamycin by cotreatment with
the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Similar to activated wtMET, loss of activated MET-Y1248H
protein expression occurred much more rapidly in the presence of geldanamycin than after inhibition of protein synthesis
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Taken together, these data suggest
that Hsp90-mediated stabilization of activated MET is required
for optimal MET kinase activity. To provide further support for
this hypothesis, we examined the ability of constitutively active
MET-Y1248H to phosphorylate its substrate Gab1 (35) in
NIH3T3/MET-Y1248H cells treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor
ganetespib (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Importantly, Gab1 is not
an Hsp90 client, and total endogenous Gab1 expression was
not affected by ganetespib treatment. Nonetheless, ganetespib
caused a dose-dependent reduction of Gab1 phosphorylation
in these cells.
To better understand where HSP90 interacts with MET and
how it might affect its kinase activity, we examined the aC-b4
loop located in the MET kinase domain. The amino acid
composition of this short loop was shown to be important for
HSP90 binding to a number of kinases including ErbB2 (36,
37). We reported previously that although the kinase domains
of HSP90-dependent ErbB2 and HSP90-independent EGFR
(ErbB1) are highly homologous, they vary in sequence in the
aC-b4 loop. Replacement of the aC-b4 loop in ErbB2 with
that of the EGFR abrogated HSP90 binding, whereas replacing
the EGFR aC-b4 loop with that of ErbB2 conferred Hsp90
association and dependence (37). When we compared the
sequence of the aC-b4 loops in EGFR and MET, we found a
divergence in eight of 10 residues between amino acids 1,132
and 1,141 (numbering for MET kinase domain residues;
highlighted in gray, Fig. 2C). To investigate whether these
residues are an important determinant of MET/HSP90

Figure 1. MET is a client protein of HSP90. A, interaction between endogenous wild-type MET and HSP90. MKN45 cells were lysed and subjected to
immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-MET antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-HSP90 and anti-MET antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with
immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as a negative control. Input represents 5% of the total protein extract used for IP. B, phosphorylated wild-type MET
preferentially interacts with HSP90. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing wild-type MET were incubated in medium supplemented with ('þ') or without ('') serum
including HGF. After 24 hours, cells were lysed and subjected to IP with anti-MET antibody and blotted with indicated antibodies. C, dose and time response

treatment with 0.5 mmol/L GA for an additional 4 hours. Cells were collected, lysed, and subjected to IP with anti-MET antibody followed by immunoblotting

interaction, we replaced the eight divergent residues in V5tagged MET-Y1248H with those found in the aC-b4 loop of
the EGFR (V5-MET-Y1248H/EGFR, highlighted in red, Fig.
2C). After transient transfection into HEK293 cells, we immunoprecipitated the tagged MET proteins with antibody to V5
and we assessed the relative association of both MET-Y1248H
and MET-Y1248H/EGFR with HSP90. Although V5 immunoprecipitation afﬁnity-puriﬁed equivalent amounts of tagged
MET proteins from cell lysates, coimmunoprecipitated
HSP90 was present in only trace amounts in MET-Y1248H/
EGFR immune pellets. This was in distinct contrast to the
amount of HSP90 found associating with MET-Y1248H protein (Fig. 2D), conﬁrming that the amino acid composition of
the aC-b4 loop in the MET-kinase domain determines HSP90
association.

www.aacrjournals.org

We noticed that, concurrent with loss of HSP90 association,
the activated fraction of immunoprecipitated MET-Y1248H/
EGFR was dramatically reduced compared with MET-Y1248H.
To conﬁrm this result, we blotted equivalent amounts of
protein lysate from the transfected cells with antibody to
phospho-MET. Substitution of the aC-b4 loop in METY1248H nearly completely abrogated its constitutive phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). To ascertain whether reduced constitutive activation also reﬂected an inability to respond to ligand,
we compared the ability of HGF to activate MET-Y1248H/
EGFR and wtMET in transiently transfected serum-starved
HEK293 cells. The data show that, although constitutive phosphorylation of MET-Y1248H/EGFR is even less than that of
wtMET (Fig. 2F, "HGF" lanes), both proteins are comparably
activated by HGF (Fig. 2F, "HGF þ" lanes). Further, we found

Figure 2. Activated MET depends on HSP90 association for its stability. A, constitutively active mutant MET strongly interacts with HSP90. NIH3T3 cells stably
expressing wild-type (wt) MET or constitutively active mutant MET (Y1248H) were lysed and subjected to IP with anti-MET antibody followed by
immunoblotting with anti-HSP90, anti-MET, and anti-p-MET antibodies. B, constitutively active mutant MET is more sensitive to HSP90 inhibition than is
wtMET. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing wtMET or constitutively active mutant MET (Y1248H) were incubated in medium supplemented with serum including
HGF and increasing concentrations of GA for 24 hours. Cells were collected and subjected to immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. C, alignment

MET/EGFR denotes MET with highlighted residues from EGFR. Amino acid residues in MET and EGFR are numbered from the starting methionine. D, METY1248H/EGFR loses association with HSP90. Expression vectors encoding V5-tagged MET-Y1248H, MET-Y1248H/EGFR or an empty vector (pcDNA, used
as a control) were transfected into HEK293 cells. After 48 hours, cells were lysed and subjected to IP with anti-V5 antibody followed by immunoblotting with
anti-HSP90, anti-V5, and anti-p-MET antibodies. E, steady-state phosphorylation of MET-Y1248H/EGFR is reduced compared with MET-Y1248H.
Expression vectors encoding V5-tagged MET-Y1248H, MET-Y1248H/EGFR or an empty vector (pcDNA) were transfected into HEK293 cells. After 48 hours,
cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting as shown. F, MET-Y1248H/EGFR retains HGF sensitivity. HEK293 cells were transfected with V5-tagged
empty plasmid, wtMET, or MET-Y1248H/EGFR (2 mg each). After 48 hours, cells were serum-starved overnight and then treated for 20 minutes with 1 nmol/L
HGF. Samples were then lysed in buffer (20 mmol/L Hepes, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 20 mmol/L Na2MoO4, phosphatase, and
protease inhibitors). Equal amounts of total cell lysate were resolved by Western blotting and probed with indicated antibodies. After normalization to
total MET protein, HGF increased the activated fractions of wtMET and MET-Y1248H/EGFR 4.8- and 8.9-fold (by densitometric analysis), respectively. G,
HEK293 cells were transfected as in (F), treated with HGF and exposed to increasing concentrations of crizotinib (16 hours). MET-Y1248H/EGFR, which
displays reduced interaction with Hsp90, is markedly more sensitive to the TKI compared with MET-Y1248H.

MET-Y1248H/EGFR to be more sensitive to crizotinib compared with MET-Y1248H (Fig. 2G), supporting an inverse
correlation between Hsp90 interaction and crizotinib sensitivity. This hypothesis is consistent with in vitro data showing
that the TKI sensitivity of constitutively active, bacterially
expressed MET-Y1248H protein is antagonized by preincubation with puriﬁed Hsp90 before in vitro kinase assay. In
contrast, the inclusion of geldanamycin restores sensitivity to
MET-TKI in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

Figure 3. MET TKI and HSP90 inhibitor synergize in wild-type MET-overexpressing cells. A, HSP90 inhibitor enhances the efﬁcacy of MET TKI on wtMET
phosphorylation and downstream signaling. MKN45 cells (left) and H1993 cells (right) were treated for 16 hours with increasing concentrations of crizotinib
alone or in combination with the indicated concentrations of ganetespib, lysed, and subjected to immunoblotting as shown. B and C, combination of crizotinib
and ganetespib synergistically inhibits wtMET-driven cell growth. MKN45 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of crizotinib alone or in
combination with the indicated concentrations of ganetespib for 48 hours and subjected to MTT assay (B). Data are expressed as mean  SD of triplicate
experiments. The combination index (CI) was calculated to examine the synergistic effect of these drugs (C). CI values less than 1 indicate synergy, whereas CI
more than 1 indicates antagonism between two drugs. D, synergistic growth inhibition is due to G1 arrest. MKN45 cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of crizotinib alone or in combination with 10 nmol/L ganetespib for 48 hours and subjected to cell-cycle analysis. E, combination
treatment dramatically inhibits soft agar colony growth of wtMET-overexpressing cells. MKN45 cells were plated in 0.4% soft agar with indicated drugs, either
alone or in combination, and cultures were maintained for 3 weeks. Representative images of colonies are shown for each condition (Scale bar, 0.1 mm);
colonies with a diameter of more than 0.1 mm were counted microscopically and graphed. Data are mean  SD of triplicate experiments.  , P < 0.05 vs.

Miyajima et al.

performed MTT assays using MKN45 cells. The addition of
increasing concentrations of ganetespib to a ﬁxed set of
crizotinib concentrations shifted the dose–response curves to
the left in a (ganetespib) concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 3B), suggesting that the combination of these two drugs
might be synergistic. We conﬁrmed this to be the case by
calculating the CI using the median-effect method of Chou and
Talalay (29). CI values of less than 1 indicate synergy, whereas
CI values of more than 1 reﬂect antagonism. Based on these
data, ganetespib and crizotinib clearly synergize in MKN45
cells (CI ¼ 0.6; Fig. 3C). Cell-cycle analysis revealed an increase
in G1 phase in ganetespib/crizotinib-treated cells (as well as a
small increase in sub-G1), and this was not observed in cells
treated with either drug alone (Fig. 3D).
Next, we determined the effect of combination therapy on
the transformed phenotype of MKN45 cells by assessing
anchorage-independent colony formation. Low-dose crizotinib (10 nmol/L) and ganetespib (10 nmol/L) alone had marginal effects on colony formation. However, a combination of
both drugs inhibited MKN45 colony formation by more than
90% (Fig. 3E). In addition, combination treatment more effectively inhibited MKN45 cell migration, compared with singleagent treatment at equivalent concentrations (Supplementary
Fig. S3).
Crizotinib-resistant MET mutants retain sensitivity to
HSP90 inhibition
De novo or acquired resistance to MET-TKI as a consequence of MET mutation remains a key therapeutic challenge
to the clinical utility of these drugs. Several germline and
somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of MET
have been identiﬁed in hereditary papillary renal cancers, and
these tumors are MET-driven (5, 13). A majority of these MET
mutants are constitutively active, and some demonstrate de
novo resistance to MET-TKI (9, 39). Because MET activity
depends on association with HSP90, we speculated that
HSP90 inhibitors might also retain activity toward a range
of MET mutants, including those that are TKI resistant. To
examine this possibility, we compared the inhibitory activity
of single-agent crizotinib with that of single-agent ganetespib
in six MET mutants—four that retain TKI sensitivity (METV1238I, MET-H1112Y, MET-M1268T, and MET-V1110I) and
two that are resistant to MET inhibitors (MET-Y1248H and
MET-L1213V). For TKI-sensitive mutants, both MET phosphorylation and the activity of downstream signaling pathways (pAKT and pERK) were equally or more potently
inhibited by ganetespib than by crizotinib (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. S4). However, in contrast to crizotinib,
ganetespib retained equivalent or greater inhibitory activity
in TKI-resistant mutants compared with wtMET (Fig. 4B).
Given these data and in light of the synergy we observed
for wtMET, we investigated next whether combining crizotinib and ganetespib might provide a therapeutic beneﬁt
in MET-TKI–resistant cells. Indeed, although crizotinib
alone at a dose less than 0.5 mmol/L did not affect MET
phosphorylation and downstream signaling in TKI-resistant
MET-Y1248H–expressing NIH3T3 cells, low concentrations
of ganetespib (10 nmol/L and 20 nmol/L, see also Fig. 4B)

together with crizotinib (0.25 mmol/L) dramatically decreased pMET, pAKT, and pERK1/2 when compared with
these concentrations of ganetespib alone (Fig. 5A). We
observed similar results for TKI-resistant MET-L1213V–
expressing NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that low-dose ganetespib can partially re–sensitize MET-TKI–resistant cells to
crizotinib. To further examine this hypothesis, we assessed
colony formation using MET-Y1248H–expressing NIH3T3
cells. Although at the concentrations chosen neither crizotinib (200 nmol/L) nor ganetespib (10 nmol/L) individually
affected colony formation, when combined they dramatically inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of these cells
(Fig. 5B). Indeed, with a calculated CI of less than 1 (see
Supplementary Table S1), the combined activity of both
drugs in this assay reﬂects synergy. In addition, combination
therapy signiﬁcantly inhibited the invasive capability of
MET-Y1248H–expressing NIH3T3 cells at dose levels that
were ineffective when administered separately (Fig. 5C).
These in vitro data suggest that combining ganetespib with
crizotinib provides at least an additive therapeutic beneﬁt in
MET-TKI–resistant cells.
HSP90 inhibition synergizes in vivo with MET-TKI, even
in MET-TKI–resistant xenografts
In order to determine whether there may be therapeutic
beneﬁt in combining ganetespib with crizotinib in vivo, we
employed two distinct xenograft models. MKN45 xenografts
(expressing wtMET) were sensitive to MET-TKI (91% inhibition of tumor growth 36 days after tumor inoculation in mice
treated daily with 50 mg/kg crizotinib) in agreement with
previous reports (12, 27), whereas MET-Y1248H NIH3T3 xenografts were predictably MET-TKI resistant (59% inhibition of
tumor growth at 21 days after daily treatment with 150 mg/kg
crizotinib; Supplementary Fig. S5). In contrast, ganetespib was
effective in both xenograft models, although at the maximum
dose used in this study (50 mg/kg administered 3 times per
week), somewhat greater activity was seen in wtMET xenografts (95% inhibition of tumor growth) compared with METY1248H xenografts (82% growth inhibition; Supplementary
Fig. S5).
To evaluate whether combination therapy was beneﬁcial in
the MKN45 model, we chose crizotinib (12.5 mg/kg) and
ganetespib (12.5 mg/kg) dosing that provided approximately
50% growth inhibition when used singly (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Treatment with this drug combination proved to be
signiﬁcantly more potent (95% growth inhibition) compared
with single-agent treatment (56% growth inhibition for crizotinib alone and 64% growth inhibition for ganetespib alone;
Fig. 6A).
In mice bearing TKI-resistant MET-Y1248H xenografts, we
similarly observed that combination therapy with ganetespib
and crizotinib (37.5 and 125 mg/kg, respectively) inhibited
tumor growth by 90%, which was signiﬁcantly greater than the
inhibition achieved by treatment with either drug alone (65%
growth inhibition for ganetespib and 31% growth inhibition for
crizitonib; Fig. 6B).
Based on a comparison of expected and obtained FTVs in
single agent- and combination-treated mice (30), crizotinib

Discussion
Although small-molecule kinase inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efﬁcacy in cancer, patients who initially
respond to such targeted therapy frequently will develop
resistance. Mechanisms of resistance include the growth
advantage provided by the appearance of drug-resistant kinase
mutations (40), as well as a process termed "oncogene switching," whereby TKI-treated cells utilize an alternative kinase to
drive shared downstream signaling pathways (41). Recent
studies have revealed that HSP90 inhibition can overcome
both forms of kinase inhibitor resistance. For example, HSP90
inhibition suppresses EGFR activity and downstream signaling
in erlotinib-resistant EGFR/T790M-expressing cells (42), and
suppresses ALK activity and signaling in cells expressing

and ganetespib synergized to inhibit both wtMET-driven
and TKI-resistant MET (Y1248H)-driven xenograft growth
(Supplementary Table S2). None of the drug regimens signiﬁcantly affected animal body weight in either xenograft
model (Fig. 6A and B). In agreement with these tumor
growth data, the impact of combination therapy on tumor
MET activation status and downstream signaling pathways
was greater than single-agent treatment in both xenograft
models, recapitulating the in vitro data described earlier (Fig.
6C and D).

crizotinib-resistant EML4-ALK/L1196M (43). Similarly, targeting HSP90 prevents escape of ErbB2-driven breast cancer cells
from chronic ErbB inhibition and escape of MET-ampliﬁed
tumor cells from MET-TKI (44, 45).
TKI-resistance–conferring MET kinase domain mutations, including Y1248H and L1213V, have been identiﬁed
in hereditary papillary renal cell carcinomas (14), and longterm exposure to MET TKI in vitro leads to acquisition of
these mutations in MET-expressing gastric cancer cells (15,
16). Such kinase-activating mutations are thought to interfere with ATP-competitive TKI binding, and they likely
contribute to both primary and acquired drug resistance
in MET-dependent cancers. We have shown that a panel of
MET proteins (both TKI-sensitive and TKI–resistant) retains
dependence on HSP90 and remains sensitive to HSP90
inhibition. Importantly, we show that the active state of
MET displays the strongest dependence on HSP90, whether
activation is induced by HGF or is a consequence of kinase
domain mutation (ligand-independent).
Because of the preference of HSP90 for activated MET,
these data suggest the possibility that HSP90 inhibition
might synergize with MET-TKI. Recent preclinical evaluation of the effects obtained upon simultaneously exposing
acute myelogenous leukemia cells expressing activated FLT3
tyrosine kinase to both a FLT3-directed TKI and a HSP90
inhibitor lends support to this possibility, as does a recent

study reporting the combinatorial beneﬁt of ganetespib,
crizotinib, and other TKIs in the context of EML4-ALK–
driven non–small cell lung cancer (46, 47). Our data show
that simultaneous treatment with MET-TKI and HSP90
inhibitor causes a true synergistic inhibition of cell growth
in wild-type MET-expressing MKN45 gastric cancer cells.
Synergy of this drug combination in these cells was reﬂected
by enhanced inhibition of downstream signaling pathways,
signiﬁcantly greater inhibition of colony growth and cell
motility, and by signiﬁcantly greater growth inhibition of
MKN45 xenografts in vivo.
Unexpectedly, we found that HSP90 inhibition also partially restored crizotinib sensitivity to two TKI-resistant
MET mutants. Combination treatment dramatically inhibited MET signaling, colony growth, cell invasion, and xenograft growth in vivo. Although some of these effects may be
due to the inhibition of additional HSP90 clients functioning
within or parallel to MET-driven signaling pathways, the
data we have presented here indicate that, at least for MET,
HSP90 inhibition directly affects MET sensitivity to a TKI.
Our model is in general agreement with a recent study
proposing that TKI binding stabilizes HSP90-dependent

kinases and obviates the need for HSP90 interaction (48),
because we have shown that it is the activated state of MET
that interacts most strongly with and is most dependent on
HSP90. Another report has suggested that TKI binding
promotes kinase degradation by denying access to HSP90
(49), although in the case of MET it appears that this would
be the case only if the TKI bound to the active conformation
of the kinase, promoted dissociation of HSP90, and limited a
return to the inactive conformation. The unexpected combinatorial beneﬁt we have shown for TKI-resistant MET
highlights the complex inﬂuence of HSP90 on kinase conformation, especially in the context of activating mutations,
and our model provides a rationale for the increased dependence of other constitutively active kinase mutations on
HSP90. For example, others have shown that HSP90 inhibitor
synergizes with a Bcr-Abl TKI in TKI-resistant chronic
myelogenous leukemia cells (50). Although the beneﬁt of
simultaneous treatment with TKI and HSP90 inhibitor
should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, a rationale for
such a strategy clearly exists in certain settings. Speciﬁcally,
our data suggest that a MET/HSP90 inhibitor combination
regimen is a viable strategy to be explored in patients with
