Iron Supplementation and
Erythropoiesis-Stimulatory Agents in
the Treatment of Cancer Anemia
Paolo Pedrazzoli, MD1, Giovanni Rosti, MD2, Simona Secondino, MD1, and Salvatore Siena, MD1

Unresponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulatory agents (ESA), which occurs in 30% to 50% of patients, is a
major limitation to the treatment of chemotherapy-related anemia (CRA). This may be related in part to
the dysregulation of iron metabolism, leading to functional iron deficiency. However, the use of iron supplementation during treatment with ESA has not been pursued as rigorously in anemic patients with cancer
as it has in patients with chronic kidney disease. In this article, the authors discuss the role of iron supplementation in the setting of CRA in view of recent reports that have addressed this issue. Cancer 2009;

KEY WORDS: iron supplementation, erythropoiesis-stimulatory agents, chemotherapy, cancer anemia.

When patients with chemotherapy-related anemia (CRA) are treated with erythropoiesis-stimulatory
agents (ESAs), a factor that may seriously limit erythropoietic response is functional iron deficiency (FID),
which represents an imbalance between iron needs in the erythropoietic bone marrow and iron supply.1
FID, frequently referred to as iron-restricted erythropoiesis, still is not defined universally by standard laboratory tests. In routine clinical management of anemic cancer patients, transferrin saturation (TSAT)
between 10% and 20% with normal or increased ferritin is the most accepted indicator of FID.2 Other laboratory parameters, including the percentage if hypochromic erythrocytes and reticulocyte hemoglobin
content,3-5 are reliable correlates of FID; however, to date, these are not widely available. FID is well recognized in the anemia of chronic kidney disease, in which it has been demonstrated that intravenous (iv)
iron, unlike oral iron, improves the hematopoietic response to ESAs with substantial cost savings.6-8
In oncology, surprisingly, the use of iron supplementation during treatment with ESA has not been rigorously as applied in anemic patients with cancer as it has for dialysis patients. This underuse is caused at least in
part by 1) the false perception that cancer patients do not have decreased iron stores (as measured by serum ferritin) and thus the belief that they do not to require iron supplementation during ESA therapy; 2) a failure to
appreciate the relative blockade in access to storage iron pools or dietary iron that frequently exists in patients
with chronic inflammatory illnesses such as cancer; and 3) the misinformation and misinterpretation of the incidence and clinical nature of serious adverse events of iv iron.9 In fact, parenteral iron still is considered a poorly
tolerated medication that not infrequently harbors anaphylactic reactions. This opinion is erroneous and stems

in part from the use of high molecular weight iron dextrans that, for a long time, were the only products available. Currently available iron preparations (low molecular
weight iron dextran, iron saccarate, and ferric gluconate)
are safe, as demonstrated clearly in dialysis patients, in
whom the incidence of severe adverse events is extremely
rare (<1:200,000).10
To our knowledge, there currently are only a limited
number of published studies regarding iron supplementation and ESA in oncology. Consequently, the authors of
the 2007 American Society of Clinical Oncology/American Society of Hematology (ASCO/ASH) guideline
update for use of epoetin and darbepoetin (DA) in
patients with cancer11 could not provide definitive recommendations to be translated into everyday clinical practice. Instead, they suggested that a priority for future
research will be obtaining better evidence of the benefits
of supplementing ESA therapy with iron, including the
dose-sparing effects of ESA, the appropriate dose, and the
formulation of iron therapy. This conclusion, as clearly
stated in the guideline article,11 was based on 3 randomized controlled trials12-14 published in the last few years,
which are discussed briefly below.
A Swedish study12 demonstrated the efficacy of iv
iron in improving hematopoietic response to epoetin b in
a small series of 67 patients with lymphoproliferative
malignancies who did not receive concurrent chemotherapy. By examining serum ferritin levels and TSAT during
the course of ESA with or without iron therapy, the
authors provided evidence that iron availability accounted
for the difference in hemoglobin response. The report
provided data indicating that parenteral iron is ESA dose
sparing in cancer patients, a point that has remained unexplored in larger trials. A limitation of the study by Hedenus et al is that ESA treatment is not indicated, and
potentially is harmful, in anemic cancer patients with
CRA who no longer are receiving cytotoxic treatment.15
Two large US studies,13,14 both of which included
patients with nonmyeloid malignancies who were receiving chemotherapy, examined the different routes of iron
administration (iv or oral) versus none in conjunction
with the use of epoetin a. The results were consistent
across these studies: The patients who received iv iron had
a significant improvement in their hematopoietic
response compared with a no-iron control group. Both
studies also indicated that there was no difference between
1170

the no-iron or oral iron groups, confirming what has been
observed previously in dialysis patients. The lack of efficacy of oral iron most likely is related to increased synthesis by the liver (which occurs in chronic inflammatory
states) of the iron regulatory peptide, hepcidin, which
decreases the gastrointestinal absorption of iron.16
Results of studies of iron supplementation in CRA
cannot be interpreted without a close look at the iron status of enrolled patients. This crucial aspect usually is
poorly discussed in the literature, and the ASCO/ASH
guidelines11 do not emphasize this point either.
Patients in the Swedish study12 had adequate body
iron stores, because they were selected if they had positive
staining for bone marrow hemosiderin. This method is
not routinely applicable in patients with solid tumors, in
whom iron status, as discussed earlier, commonly is
assessed using serum ferritin and TSAT values.
The study by Auerbach et al13 included only patients
with CRA who had iron deficiency (functional in most
patients). When FID is present in patients who are receiving an ESA, iron repletion already is recommended based
on indirect evidence and biologic inferences, as stated literally in the 2002 ASCO/ASH guidelines.17 Moreover, in
the limited fraction of patients with absolute iron deficiency, iron supplementation well may be responsible per
se for any hematopoietic response.
Patients enrolled in the study reported by Henry
14
et al were required to have a serum ferritin level 100
ng/mL or a TSAT 15%. In chronic inflammatory states,
including cancer, these parameters are not stringent
enough to define an iron-replete population.2 The study
had a low hemoglobin response rate (41%) in the epoetinonly arm, which may have been a consequence of the
shorter duration of the study (9 weeks vs 12-16 weeks), or
it may have been caused at least in part by the inclusion of
some patients with FID. In that study, FID developed in
significantly more patients who received oral iron or no
iron than in patients who received parenteral iron, as demonstrated by much greater increases in the percentage of
hypochromic erythrocytes and decreases in TSAT and reticulocyte hemoglobin levels in the nonparenteral iron
arm. For the reason noted earlier, these studies cannot
provide an answer regarding whether iron supplementation is capable of increasing the fraction of patients without iron deficiency (the majority of CRA patients) who
respond to ESA.

Review Article

Two prospective trials that were published after
the release of the ASCO/ASH guidelines have provided
additional information relevant to the use of iron supplementation in CRA. Three hundred ninety-six anemic
patients with nonmyeloid malignancies who received
chemotherapy and DA every 3 weeks were assigned randomly by Bastit et al18 to receive either iv iron at a dose
of 200 lg every 3 weeks (or the same dose within a 3week period) or standard practice for iron administration (no iron or oral iron). Hematopoietic response, the
primary endpoint of the study, significantly favored the
iv iron group, and there were no safety concerns in either arm. Unlike the other studies of iron supplementation, this trial, which to our knowledge is the largest
published to date, also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of erythrocyte transfusions administered in the iv iron group. The study did
not consider stringent iron parameters for patient enrolment, thus including approximately 35% of overtly or
functionally iron-deficient patients.
An Italian multicenter study19 randomized 149
iron-replete patients, who were defined as having serum
ferritin levels 100 ng/mL and TSAT 20%, to receive
conventional weekly darbepoetin either alone or in conjunction with ferric gluconate at a dose of 125 mg weekly
for the first 6 weeks. The study demonstrated that iv iron
supplementation significantly reduced treatment failures
on ESA with no additional toxicity. The percentage of responders in the control group was comparable to rates
reported in previous studies using DA.20 It is noteworthy
that, when investigating the patients who strictly fulfilled
the eligibility criteria and who received at least 4 administrations of DA, the rate of patients achieving a hematopoietic response in the iv iron group was >90%. These
findings confirm that preventing the development of FID
by means of iv iron supplementation is the mechanism
most likely involved in improving the hematopoietic
response in iron-replete patients who are receiving
ESA.12,14
Published studied of iron supplementation and ESA
are summarized in Table 1. Evidence from these studies,12-14,18,19 which, overall, included 920 patients, and
well established clinical notions allow the following practical considerations for the management of anemic cancer
patients.
1172

• Iron parameters should always be measured in
patients with cancer/CRA.
• Iron supplements should be given iv rather then
orally, because it has been demonstrated that oral
iron largely is ineffective in cancer patients, which
also is true for anemia in other chronic diseases.
• Patients with an absolute iron deficiency (TSAT
<10% or ferritin below normal range) should
receive iv iron supplementation only; until iron parameters are normalized, the administration of ESA
would be ineffective.
• Intravenous iron supplementation should be given
when ESA therapy is instituted both in patients with
FID and in iron-replete patients. This issue is relevant
clinically, because appropriate iron supplementation,
apart from allowing more patients to benefit from
ESA therapy, well may represent a strategy to improve
the cost-effectiveness of ESA in oncology, which has
occurred in nephrology.12,21 The iv administration of
100 to 300 mg of elemental iron every week or every
other week for a total dose of 750 to 1000 mg (in
iron-replete patients) and up to 2000 mg (in patients
with FID) during the correction phase of anemia will
maximize the effectiveness of ESA. Patients with iron
overload (in oncology, safety data exist up to TSAT
>45% and serum ferritin >1000 lg/L) should not
receive iron to avoid toxicity from iron excess.22,23
In conclusion, iv iron supplementation, alone or in
conjunction with ESA, is a valid therapeutic tool for the
treatment of cancer anemia, and its use should be considered more extensively in medical oncology. Baseline and
periodic monitoring of iron parameters is necessary to
avoid unneeded or potentially harmful therapies.
