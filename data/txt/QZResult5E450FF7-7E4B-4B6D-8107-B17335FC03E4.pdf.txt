BACKGROUND: The current phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study was conducted to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of the novel mitochondrial inhibitor ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors.
METHODS: Patients with refractory solid tumors were treated in a 3 1 3 dose escalation design. ME-344 was administered via intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of the first 28-day cycle and weekly thereafter. Pharmacokinetics was assessed on days 1 and 15 of
the first cycle. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (median age, 65 years; 67% of whom were female) received ME-344. There were 5
dose-limiting toxicities reported. Four patients developed grade 3 neuropathy (2 patients each at doses of 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg)
and 1 patient treated at a dose of 10 mg/kg developed a grade 3 acute myocardial infarction (toxicity was graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.03]). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was
defined as 10 mg/kg weekly. The most common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. At the MTD of 10 mg/kg, the
maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) was 25.8 mg/mL and the area under the concentration curve from time zero to infinity was 25.9
hour*mg/mL. One patient with small cell lung cancer achieved a partial response for 52 weeks. Four patients had prolonged stable
disease (1 patient each with urothelial carcinoma [47 weeks], carcinoid tumor [40 weeks], cervical leiomyosarcoma [39 weeks], and
cervical cancer [31 weeks]). CONCLUSIONS: The once-weekly administration of ME-344 was generally well tolerated in the current
study, a first-in-human study; dose-limiting neuropathy was noted, but not at the MTD. Exposures at the 10-mg/kg dose level suggest
a sufficient therapeutic index. The preliminary clinical activity as a monotherapy supports the further clinical development of ME-344

INTRODUCTION
ME-344 is a synthetic small molecule based on the isoflavan ring structure. It is the demethylated metabolite of NV-128,
an agent that disrupts tumor cell mitochondrial integrity, which results in translocation of endonuclease G to the nucleus,
subsequent DNA degradation, and caspase-independent cell death.1,2 ME-344 has demonstrated single-agent activity
greater than that of NV-128 in preclinical studies.1,2 NV-128 and ME-344 have also been shown to disrupt both mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and complex 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2) upstream and downstream signal transduction. In addition, cells treated with NV-128 express markers of autophagy, including the presence of autolysosomes,
confirming that NV-128 induces autophagic cell death.2 Of particular interest are the published reports that NV-128
inhibits growth of a lineage of paclitaxel-resistant and carboplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer tumor cells with the
phenotype of ovarian cancer stem cells.1,2 ME-344 inhibits the growth of these cell lines as well, but at concentrations well
below those necessary for NV-128,2 indicating that ME-344 is more potent than NV-128. ME-344 has also been reported
to reduce tumor burden in an in vivo model of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.3
To our knowledge, the specific target for NV-128 and ME-344 binding is unknown; however, the biochemical
effects after tumor cell treatment with ME-344 are similar to those observed with NV-128, including inhibition of the

mTORC1-dependent and mTORC2-dependent pathways, the appearance of autophagic vacuoles, and activation of the mitochondrial pERK pathway.
The current first-in-human phase 1, open-label,
multicenter, nonrandomized, dose escalation study was
conducted with the primary objectives of determining the
tolerability, adverse event (AE) profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors. Secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetic
(PK) profile and to describe any clinical antitumor activity
observed in patients treated with ME-344.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
01544322) was conducted in accordance with applicable
regulatory guidelines, the International Conference on
Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice,
and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Boards at participating sites
(Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, Tenn; The University of
Oklahoma Stephenson Cancer Center, Oklahoma City,
Okla; and the Florida Cancer Specialists, Sarasota, Fla),
and patients were enrolled after providing written
informed consent.
Patient Selection

Eligible patients were aged 18 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
of 0 or 1 and histologically confirmed locally advanced or
metastatic cancer that had no standard therapeutic alternatives with a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.
Patients with tumor involvement of the central nervous
system were required to receive approval from the medical
monitor. Eligible patients could not have undergone any
major surgery or received radiotherapy or immunotherapy
within 21 days of initiating study treatment, or received
limited palliative radiotherapy within 14 days. Patients
with chemotherapy regimens with delayed toxicity within
4 weeks of the study initiation (or within 6 weeks for prior
nitrosourea or mitomycin C) or chemotherapy regimens
given continuously or on a weekly basis with limited
potential for delayed toxicity within 2 weeks of the study
initiation were also excluded.
Eligible patients had adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function, defined as an absolute neutrophil count >1.53109/L, a platelet count >1003109/L,
hemoglobin >9 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or <5 times the ULN for patients with liver

metastases, and serum creatinine 1.5 times the ULN.
Adequate cardiac function (as evidenced by creatine kinase [CK] and CK-MB below the ULN, troponin I levels
within normal limits at baseline, an average QTc Fridericia interval from triplicate screening electrocardiograms of
<470 milliseconds, and a left ventricular ejection fraction
greater than the lower limit of the institutional normal
value) was also required.
Study Design

Before the initiation of treatment, all patients underwent
a physical examination, ECOG performance status, 12lead electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and tumor
imaging. Fasting baseline laboratory assessments included
a complete blood count, including differentials and platelets; blood chemistry, including sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, total protein, albumin, bilirubin (total
and direct), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose; urinalysis
(dipstick); and troponin I, CK, and CK-MB.
Patients were administered ME-344 intravenously
(iv) over 30 minutes in 28-day cycles. The first treatment
cycle for all cohorts consisted of iv infusions on days 1, 8,
and 15, with an evaluation and 1 week of rest beginning
on day 22. Beginning in cycle 2 for all cohorts, ME-344
was administered on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day
cycle. Patients were allowed to continue weekly dosing at
their assigned dose provided they were receiving clinical
benefit as assessed by the investigator. Prophylactic antiemetics were not allowed, but supportive care measures
and treatment for symptom control or drug-related toxicity were permitted.
Tumor assessments were performed at a minimum
of every 12 weeks, and were classified according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST;
version 1.1).4 All AEs were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology for
Adverse Events (version 4.03),5 and were followed for 30
days after the last dose of study drug was administered or
until they resolved (whichever occurred sooner).
Definition of MTD and DLT

The MTD was defined as the dose level immediately
below the dose level at which 2 of the first 3 patients per
cohort (or 2 of 6 patients) experienced a DLT during
the first treatment cycle (28 days).
A DLT was defined as any of the following occurring during the first cycle of treatment and assessed as
being related to the study drug: grade 3 neutropenia
lasting 5 days or febrile neutropenia (single oral

bleeding; grade 3 abnormal laboratory values (except
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) that were assessed as
being clinically significant; and grade 3 nonlaboratory
toxicity (excluding rash, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting, if
controlled with standard supportive therapy).
PK Assessments

Nonfasting serial blood samples were collected for PK
analysis before infusion; just before the end of infusion;
and 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5
hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, and 24
hours after ME-344 dosing on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1,
and were analyzed for levels of ME-344.
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were descriptive in nature and statistical hypothesis testing was not performed. Estimation of the PK parameters was performed by
noncompartmental methods. All patients who received
at least 1 dose of the study drug were included in the
evaluation of safety.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Between May 2012 and March 2013, 31 patients were
screened and 30 patients were enrolled on the study. Base1058

line characteristics of the enrolled patients are found in
Table 1. The majority of patients were white (87%) and
female (67%). The median age of the patients was 65
years (range, 19-85 years). Approximately 53% of the
patients had an ECOG performance status of 0, and 47%
had an ECOG performance status of 1. Nearly two-thirds
of the patients had received 3 prior therapies. Colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung cancer were the most common tumor types (5 patients each [17%]).
Treatment

Three to 8 patients were enrolled into each of 6 cohorts
(Table 2). A total of 21 patients (70%) completed at least
2 cycles of ME-344. Five patients completed 9 cycles,
and 28 patients (93%) had discontinued treatment at the
time of last follow-up. Treatment with ME-344 was
ongoing for 2 patients at the time of data cutoff for the
current study. As of July 30, 2014, one patient being
treated at dose level 3 was on cycle 26 (101 weeks). A second patient was originally treated at dose level 5 (20 mg/
kg), but had their dose reduced to 5 mg/kg, and was on
cycle 20 (80 weeks) at the time of last follow-up. Disease
progression was the most common reason for discontinuation of study treatment (16 patients; 52%). Five patients
(16%) who had a DLT were required as per protocol to be
discontinued from study treatment.
Dose Escalation and MTD

Dose escalation and DLTs are shown in Table 2. Dose
levels 1 (1.25 mg/kg), 2 (2.5 mg/kg), and 3 (5 mg/kg)
each enrolled at least 3 evaluable patients without occurrence of a DLT. At the fourth dose level (10 mg/kg), no
patients experienced a DLT, and therefore the ME-344
dose was escalated to 20 mg/kg (dose level 5). Two of the
8 patients treated at this dose level developed doselimiting peripheral neuropathy. One patient experienced
grade 3 peripheral neuropathy after the second dose of
ME-344. The neuropathy resolved to a new baseline of
grade 1 after 2 weeks. The second patient developed grade
3 peripheral sensory neuropathy at the time of the first
infusion of ME-344. This neuropathy did not resolve after 10 weeks.
Because the dose of 20 mg/kg was not tolerable, an
intermediate dose of 15 mg/kg was then studied (dose level
6). Two of the 4 patients treated at this dose level developed
peripheral neuropathy DLTs. One patient had baseline
grade 1 peripheral neuropathy from previous chemotherapy and developed grade 3 peripheral neuropathy after the
second dose of ME-344. The neuropathy resolved back to
baseline with discontinuation of the study drug. The

second patient developed grade 3 peripheral neuropathy of
the right arm on day 2 of cycle 1, which resolved within 6
days and study treatment was therefore continued. However, the grade 3 peripheral neuropathy of the right arm
recurred after the day 15 infusion on cycle 1 and the patient
was removed from study for DLT. The neuropathy did
resolve to baseline. Because dose level 6 resulted in 2 DLTs,
an additional 3 patients were dosed at dose level 4 (10 mg/
kg). One patient experienced a DLT of non-ST segment
elevation myocardial infarction that occurred at the end of
the first infusion of ME-344 and was accompanied by
hypertension, nausea, and vomiting. It should be noted
that the patient had a history of hyperlipidemia and was
receiving nitroglycerin and isosorbide mononitrate, both of
which were used to treat angina, as well as the hypertension
drug metoprolol when she was enrolled to the study. No
further cardiac workup was performed by the treating
physicians due to the patient having advanced lung cancer,
Cancer

although the patient did recover from the event. This
patient subsequently came off study. No additional DLTs
were observed, and the MTD was therefore declared to be
10 mg/kg administered iv weekly.

Safety

Every patient experienced at least 1 AE of any grade, and
63% of patients (19 patients) experienced a treatmentrelated AE, primarily grade 1/2. The most frequent AEs
considered to be related to treatment with ME-344 and
reported by 10% of patients were peripheral neuropathy
(20%), nausea (20%), dizziness (20%), fatigue (17%), vomiting (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (10%) (Table 3).
Importantly, of the 6 total patients who experienced
peripheral neuropathy, 5 had baseline neuropathy before
initiation of the study. There was 1 treatment-related AE
noted, but no DLTs were reported due to central nervous
system dysfunction.
Six patients experienced serious AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. These included 3 events of peripheral neuropathy and 1 event each of sinus bradycardia,
non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and an
infusion reaction (hypertension and bradycardia). As
described above, 5 of these AEs/serious AEs were considered to be DLTs.
Targeted safety evaluations, based on preclinical toxicology findings, including both cardiac function (cardiac
enzyme evaluation) and QTc prolongation, were performed in all patients. One patient treated at the dose of
10 mg/kg experienced grade 2 prolonged QTc Fridericia
intervals assessed as being related to study treatment. No

other clinically significant cardiac function findings were
noted in the current study.
Two deaths occurred within 30 days of treatment discontinuation: 1 patient treated at a dose of 5 mg/kg died after a subarachnoid hemorrhage attributed to the patient’s
known meningeal carcinomatosis, and a second patient
treated at a dose of 20 mg/kg died after an event of intractable vomiting and a general deterioration in health attributed
to his progressive bladder cancer. There were no deaths
reported while patients were receiving the study treatment.
Pharmacokinetics

Samples from 28 patients were available for PK analysis. All
17 patients in the first 4 cohorts (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10) had PK
sampling on days 1 and 15. In the cohort of patients treated
at a dose of 15 mg/kg, 4 patients had PK data from day 1,
one of whom also completed day 15 PK sampling. In the
cohort of patients treated with 20 mg/kg, 7 patients had day 1
PK data, 4 of whom also completed day 15 PK sampling.
At the time of visual inspection of the mean area
under the concentration curve (AUC) curves, ME-344
plasma levels declined in a biexponential or triexponential
manner on both day 1 and day 15. The AUC and the
maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) were essentially
identical when comparing day 1 and day 15 across the
dose levels (Fig. 1). To assess accumulation, the ratio
between the day 1 and day 15 dose-adjusted Cmax and the
AUC was evaluated. The geometric mean ratio of the day
1/day 15 Cmax was 1.99 mg/mL/mg (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 20.29 to 2.80) and the day 1/day 15
1060

Figure 2. ME-344 plasma concentration on day 1 versus time
is shown.

dose-adjusted AUC was 0.008 hour* mg/mL/mg (95%
CI, 21.01 to 0.04), also supporting no accumulation at
day 15 of cycle 1. The Cmax was observed at the end of the
30-minute infusion, and demonstrated an increase with
increasing dose, as did the AUC.
Regression analysis of plots of Cmax and AUC by
dose level on days 1 and 15 suggest dose linearity with
increasing dose. For AUC, the correlation coefficient was
0.9883 on day 1 and 0.7111 on day 15 (Fig. 2). Similarly,
the correlation for Cmax by dose level on day 1 was 0.9827
and was 0.7701 on day 15. The decrease in correlation on
day 15 was likely driven by the 15-mg/kg dose level, on
which only 1 patient was treated.
The results of the PK analyses demonstrated that
ME-344 plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential fashion with a mean half-life of approximately 6
hours. A linear relationship is suggested by plotting the
ME-344 dose (as mg/kg) and the day 1 Cmax levels and exposure (AUC) levels, with good correlation noted
between day 1 and day 15.
ME-344 values for volume of distribution at steady
state (Vdss), half-life (t1/2), and drug clearance (Cl) appear
to be dose-independent. In addition, there were no statistical differences with regard to drug clearance and Vdss
noted between day 1 and day 15.

at a dose of 5 mg/kg, had achieved a partial response at his
cycle 11 assessment. The patient had developed disease

progression on 3 prior regimens and the treatment duration for the preceding regimen was 11 weeks. He was continuing treatment and on his 11th cycle of therapy (52
weeks) with an ongoing partial response noted at the time
of data cutoff for the current study. Computed tomography images of this patient at week 52 demonstrated a
marked decrease in tumor size from baseline (Fig. 3). In
addition, 10 patients (33%) experienced stable disease
during the study. The 4 most prolonged cases included 1
patient each with urothelial carcinoma (47 weeks), carcinoid of the ileum on cycle 10 of treatment (40 weeks),
cervical leiomyosarcoma (39 weeks), and cervical cancer
on cycle 8 of treatment (31 weeks) at the time of data cutoff. Ten patients (33%) had developed disease progression
at the time of the first evaluation. For 7 of 11 patients
experiencing a partial response or stable disease, the duration of ME-344 therapy was greater than the duration of
the previous treatment regimens (Fig. 4).
The median progression-free survival was 6.9 weeks
(95% CI, 1.6-7.1 weeks), with a range of 0 to 52 weeks.
Since the time of database lock, the 3 patients who
were still receiving study treatment continued to be monitored. As of July 30, 2014, the patient with SCLC with a
partial response remained on treatment and was on his 26th
cycle of therapy at the time of last follow-up (101weeks).
One patient with carcinoid tumor continued to maintain
stable disease after 20 cycles of treatment (80 weeks),
whereas 1 patient with cervical cancer developed disease
progression at week 42 and discontinued treatment.

DISCUSSION
Once-weekly administrations of ME-344 were generally
well tolerated in this first-in-human study of patients with
refractory solid tumors. There were 5 DLTs observed, 4
of which were peripheral neuropathy. The MTD was
determined to be 10 mg/kg weekly. The most common
AEs related to ME-344 across all dose levels were neuropathy, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue.
PK analysis revealed that ME-344 plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential fashion with a mean
half-life of approximately 6 hours. A linear relationship
was suggested by plotting the ME-344 dose (mg/kg) and
day 1 Cmax levels and exposure (AUC) levels, with good
correlation noted at day 1 and day 15. Volume of distribution values, terminal half-life, and drug clearance values
appeared to be independent of ME-344 dose. There were
no statistical differences noted in the volume of distribution and clearance values between days 1 and 15.
A preliminary assessment suggests that neurotoxicity
is dose-related, with all neuropathy occurring in the 2
highest dose levels (15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively),
with higher AUCs and Cmax. It should be noted that neuropathy was noted only at dose levels higher than the
determined MTD and the majority of patients with neuropathic toxicity (5 of 6 patients) had experienced it during previous treatment regimens.
The increased neuropathy observed in the current
study would be expected based on ME-344’s disruption
of mitochondrial integrity. Mitochondrial dysfunction
has been implicated in chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy,6-8 and patients with congenital mitochondrial syndromes such as ataxia telangiectasia,9 AlpersHuttenlocher syndrome,10 and ataxia with oculomotor
apraxia11 often have a prominent neurological
dysfunction.
ME-344 has a mechanism of action that is distinct
from ME-143, a related drug candidate currently under
clinical evaluation.12 The overall safety profile of ME-344
was similar to that described in the first-in-human trial of
ME-143, with the exception of the AE of peripheral neuropathy observed in the current trial. Infusion reactions
were noted in 2 patients who were treated at the maximal
administered dose studied (20 mg/kg) in the ME-143
trial, whereas only 1 patient treated with ME-344 (15 mg/
kg) had an infusion reaction that resulted in treatment discontinuation. Although there were no objective responses
observed with ME-143, 1 patient with SCLC who was
being treated with ME-344 on the current trial (at a dose
of 5 mg/kg) achieved a partial response, and 10 others
were noted to have stable disease. Based on in vitro results
1062

with NV-128, future studies with ME-344 will include
biomarker analysis of targets downstream of mTOR, such
as pAKT or pS6K.1
The preliminary efficacy observed in the current
study appears promising and merits further study of the
drug. Approximately 75% of patients with stable disease
or better had more durable disease control on ME-344
than on the treatment regimen immediately preceding
ME-344.
The once-weekly administration of ME-344 was
generally well tolerated in this first-in-human study of
patients with refractory solid tumors. ME-344 demonstrated the DLT of neuropathy and the MTD was found
to be 10 mg/kg. In vitro studies of ME-344 in combination with topotecan have demonstrated that these drugs
act synergistically (data on file). Because topotecan has a
different toxicity profile from ME-344 in clinical trials,
this was a rational combination for development.13
Therefore, a phase 1B study of ME-344 in combination
with iv topotecan as treatment of patients with ovarian,
cervical, and small cell lung cancers currently is ongoing
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier 02100007).
