ABSTRACT
The goal of targeted immunotherapy in cancer is to damage both malignant
and tumor-supporting cells of the microenvironment but spare unaffected tissue.
The malignant cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) selectively express CD30.
They release this receptor on extracellular vesicles (EVs) for the tumor-supporting
communication with CD30 ligand (CD30L)-positive bystander cells. Here, we
investigated how CD30-positive EVs influence the efficacy of the CD30 antibody drug
conjugate (ADC) Brentuximab Vedotin (SGN-35). The malignant cells and the EVs
expressed the active sheddase ADAM10. ADAM10 cleaved and released the CD30
ectodomain (sCD30), causing a gradual depletion of SGN-35 binding sites on EVs
and creating a soluble competitor of the ADC therapy. In a 3D semi-solid tumor
microenvironment model, the EVs were retained in the matrix whereas sCD30
penetrated readily into the surrounding culture medium. This resulted in a lowered
ratio of EV-associated CD30 (CD30EV) to sCD30 in the surrounding medium in
comparison to non-embedded cultures. A low percentage of CD30EV was also detected
in the plasma of cHL patients, supporting the clinical relevance of the model. The
adherence of CD30EV but not sCD30 to CD30–/CD30L+ mast cells and eosinophils
allowed the indirect binding of SGN-35. Moreover, SGN-35 damaged CD30-negative
cells, provided they were loaded with CD30+ EVs.

INTRODUCTION

selectively express the lymphoid activation marker CD30
(TNF receptor superfamily member 8, TNFRSF8) whereas
the mast cells and eosinophils the corresponding ligand
(TNFSF8, CD30L, CD153). Both are transmembrane
proteins. Hodgkin cells also release extracellular vesicles
(EVs) containing CD30 (CD30EV) as a membrane protein
[5]. In addition, CD30 is cleaved by metalloproteinases
[6]. This generates primarily two fragments, the soluble

Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is characterized
by a few malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg
(HRS) cells, which are supported by a heterogeneous
infiltrate of proinflammatory cells. Particularly the mast
cell, eosinophil and macrophage count is described
as a negative prognostic marker [1–4]. The HRS cells

ectodomain (CD30ecto or sCD30) and the remaining
cell-associated transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain
(CD30endo). Virtually all commercially available CD30
antibodies detect the ectodomain. In normal and malignant
cells, CD30 is cleaved by the metalloproteinases ADAM10
and ADAM17 [7, 8]. In particular ADAM10 was also
detected on EVs from normal lymphoid cells and various
cancer cell types (www.exocarta.org) and only recently it
became clear, that the enzyme might also be functional on
released EVs [9].
The Hodgkin lymphoma benefits from the CD30/
CD30L crosstalk. Ligation of CD30 stimulates the NF-κB
survival signaling in the HRS cells [10]. Conversely,
ligation of CD30L+ in immune cells stimulates the release
of tumor-promoting factors without degranulation of
cytotoxic substances [11, 12]. EVs might replace the
direct cell contact, as CD30EV is also able to stimulate
CD30L+ cells in a CD30-dependent manner [5]. By
contrast, monomeric sCD30 also binds to CD30L but
it is not agonistic [13]. Both released formats also bind
the therapeutic CD30 antibodies or antibody-drug
conjugates (ADCs) and might influence the outcome of
the immunotherapy.
The CD30 antibody drug conjugate (ADC)
Brentuximab Vedotin (SGN-35, Adcetris) is highly
effective and safe in the treatment of CD30+ lymphomas.
In a pivotal phase II study with patients with relapsed and
refractory cHL, the overall response rate after SGN-35
treatment was 75% with 33% complete remissions [14].
SGN-35 is an ADC, which contains the anti-mitotic drug
monomethylauristatin E (MMAE), covalently linked to
the chimeric CD30 antibody cAC10 [15]. After CD30specific internalization, MMAE is cleaved from the ADC
and activated to harm the affected cell. Recently, it was
described that SGN-35 also damages CD30-negative
bystander cells [16, 17]. The authors explained this effect
by small amounts of cleaved hydrophobic MMAE, which
diffuse from the cytoplasm of the CD30+ target cell, through
the membrane into the environment. Close bystander cells
might non-specifically take up this cytotoxic MMAE.
Here, we suggest another hypothesis. Our data indicate
that the malignant cells release CD30 on EVs. These EVs
bind to CD30L on bystander cells and present additional
membrane-associated CD30 sites for the binding and toxic
activity of SGN-35. We suggest that this mechanism allows
dual targeting of cancer and bystander cells.

147 nm and 170 nm (Figure 1A). They expose CD30 [5].
In semi-quantitative mass spectrometry we identified the
CD30 sheddase ADAM10 with one, three and four unique
peptides in EVs from KM-H2, L1236 and L540 cells,
respectively (Supplementary 1). ADAM10 was also detected
by flow cytometry in EVs from all tested cell lines (Figure 1B).
Freshly synthesized ADAM10 is functionally inhibited through
its inhibitory propeptide (aa 1-223, Supplementary  1). It is
activated by the proteolytic removal of the propeptide. In mass
spectrometry of EVs we only identified unique hits from mature
ADAM10 (Supplementary 1). In cell lysate, we identified both,
pro-ADAM10 and mature ADAM10 by Western Blot (Figure
1C). In EVs we confirmed only the mature form. These data
suggest that active ADAM10 is expressed on EVs.
To directly demonstrate that ADAM10 is active on
EVs, we applied fluorescence resonance energy transfer
metalloproteinase substrates to isolated EVs. A peptide,
based on the precursor of TNF-alpha (PEPDAB010), was
efficiently hydrolyzed by the EVs from KM-H2, L1236 and
L540 (Figure 1D). The metalloproteinase inhibitor BB3644
blocked the cleavage, confirming the metalloproteinase
activity on EVs. Since PEPDAB010 is also sensitive for
other ADAM enzymes, we additionally tested the ADAM10selective PEPMCA001. The latter is very selective for
ADAM10 over other enzymes and it was not cleaved by
recombinant ADAM17 (Figure 1E) [18]. EVs of KM-H2
cells efficiently processed this ADAM10 substrate and both
BB3466 and the ADAM10-selective inhibitor GI254023X
blocked the cleavage (Figure 1E) [19]. Based on these
data, we conclude that catalytically active ADAM10 is
expressed on EVs of cHL cell lines. 

CD30 ectodomain shedding on isolated EVs
To study CD30 ectodomain shedding on isolated
EVs, we used a pair of non-competing CD30 ectodomain
(CD30ecto) antibodies (Ki-2 mAb and Ki-3 mAb; used in
commercial ELISA) and generated a novel pair of CD30
endodomain (CD30endo) antibodies (Ki-10 mAb and Ki12 mAb; Supplementary 2). The novel Ki-12 mAb binds to
the cytoplasmic sequence aa 465-500 and the novel Ki-10
mAb to the far C-terminal sequence of CD30 (aa 500–595).
In addition to the published bands of intact CD30 [20], the
CD30endo antibodies detected also smaller bands in Western
Blot. They might at least in part represent degradation
products of CD30, which are expected after CD30 cleavage.
In cHL cell lines CD30endo is biosynthesized as the
C-terminal part of CD30. However, a splice variant of
CD30 (variant CD30; aa 464–595) has been described in
other cell types [21, 22]. Therefore the epitopes of the novel
antibodies might not be cHL-selective. However, similar
to the established CD30ecto antibody Ki-2, the CD30endo
antibodies showed strong staining of the malignant cells
in cHL tissue. Because of the so far unknown selectivity,
we used the novel antibodies only to support ectodomain
shedding on EVs.

RESULTS
ADAM10 activity on extracellular vesicles from
Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines
The size of EVs from the supernatants of three
cHL cell lines was determined by nanoparticle tracking
analysis (NTA). The EVs from L540, KM-H2 and L1236
cells appeared with a typical mean EV diameter between

We incubated EVs from KM-H2 and L1236 cells
for 18 h and determined CD30 by flow cytometry. In this
period EVs showed a significant reduction of CD30ecto
to 47% and 66% of the inhibited control but no reduction
of CD30endo (Figure 2A). CD30endo remains at the
cytoplasmic side of the membrane after cleavage. The
uninfluenced CD30endo confirms that the CD30ecto loss
is due to ectodomain cleavage. We also calculated the
ratio between the extracellular and intracellular CD30
levels (Ki-2Ab/Ki-10Ab) from the geomeans of flow
cytometry. L1236 EVs resulted in ratios of 0.084 versus
0.163 and KM-H2 in 0.423 versus 0.862, in untreated and
inhibited aliquots, respectively. This equals a CD30endonormalized CD30ecto reduction to 51.5% (L1236 EVs)
and 49.1% (KM-H2 EVs).

We developed a CD30endo ELISA using the novel
antibodies Ki-10 and Ki-12. Together with the commercial
ELISA (CD30ecto) we were able to detect and quantify
the intracellular and extracellular part of CD30 (Figure
2B). ELISA data confirmed that isolated EVs released the
CD30ecto (sCD30) into the supernatant. This depleted
the EV-associated CD30ecto signal but kept the amount
of CD30endo stable. We also calculated the ratio of
extracellular and intracellular CD30 units/mL. With a
ratio of 1.675 for untreated and 2.35 for inhibited EVs,
we calculated a CD30endo-based CD30ecto loss to 71.3%
compared with the metalloproteinase-inhibited control. A
background of CD30endo was detected in the supernatants
after ultracentrifugation at the end of the incubation time.
This might at least in part be explained by the incomplete

2 h in serum-free medium. Under these conditions they showed no loss of viability. The cell supernatant was precleared by a sequence
of centrifugation steps before it was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 100000 × g. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of PBS
and tested by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The graph shows an overlay of 5 independent determinations of the L540 EVs. The
mean diameters of EVs from all tested cell lines are shown in the summarizing graph. (B) The EVs from 8 × 107 KM-H2, L1236 or

25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 containing 6 × 10–4 % Brij-35 in the presence or absence of 3 µM BB3644 or 3 µM GI254023X. Then, the aliquots
were incubated with the fluorescent substrates PEPDAB010 (D) or PEPMCA001 (E) (BioZyme Inc., Apex, NC) in black microtiter plates at
37°C. Fluorescence was determined in a kinetic study at 530 nm (D) or 393 nm (E) as indicated. The data show means of two independent
experiments minus background fluorescence without EVs.

EV sedimentation under 2 h ultracentrifugation. Repeated
centrifugation, longer centrifugation or higher gravidity
better depletes EVs but the EV decomposition is also
enhanced [23]. However, both tests clearly indicate that
CD30 is also shed on EVs and that the CD30 reduction
is caused by ectodomain cleavage by metalloproteinases.

is the most common cHL subtype (~80%) and displays
a strong extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition [10, 24].
Thus, the EVs have to overcome a microenvironment
of ECM and bystander cells to reach the circulation.
This raises the question whether EVs loose the CD30
ectodomain by metalloproteinase cleavage during
migration through this microenvironment. We first tested
the influence of semi-solid matrigel, which contains
proteins of the ECM and the basal membrane but does
not respect binding of EVs to bystander cells. In a second
approach, we investigated the influence of cell aggregates
(Supplementary 3).

In cHL, the HRS cells are surrounded by bystander
cells and a non-cellular matrix. Nodular sclerosis (NS)

Figure 2: Ectodomain shedding on Hodgkin cell-derived EVs. Isolated EVs from the supernatants of 8 × 107 L1236 and KM-

H2 cells were cultivated in EV-depleted medium for 18 h at 37°C ± BB3644 (3 µM, red line and red/shaded bar). Then, EVs were again
centrifuged at 100000 × g. (A) The pellet was washed once in PBS and immobilized at 4.5 µm-microspheres. Aliquots of microspheres were
incubated with Ki-2 mAb (CD30ecto), Ki-12 mAb (CD30endo) or isotype control (filled histogram). Aliquots for CD30endo determination
were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 before the addition of the antibodies (TX perm). Samples were labeled with fluorescencelabeled anti-mouse IgG for flow cytometry. (B) After ultracentrifugation, the pellets and the supernatants were evaluated by the commercial
ELISA (CD30ecto) and the CD30endo ELISA as indicated. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFIs) of 4–5 independent experiments were
evaluated by arbitrarily setting the inhibited aliquots as 100%. The percentages of the non-inhibited aliquots were statistically evaluated by
a two-tailed, nonparametric t-test (Mann-Whitney) (ns = not significant, * = P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).

We embedded L540 cell (NS-subtype) and
used CD30 as a tracer to study the EV migration and
CD30 shedding during the passage through matrigel
(Figure 3A). CD30EV and sCD30 were separated by
ultracentrifugation. Then, we compared their amounts in
the medium of a suspension cell culture and in the medium
that surrounds the matrigel-embedded culture. Embedding
did not significantly influence the release of sCD30 in the
surrounding supernatant indicating that CD30 cleavage
and sCD30 diffusion was not considerably inhibited in
the matrix. In contrast, embedding resulted in a 5.3-fold
decrease of released CD30EV. This equals a reduction to
19% of the suspended control (P > 0.0001, N = 4) and
a drop in the percentage of CD30EV from 14.8% in the
supernatant of suspended cells to 3.0% in embedded
cells. This reduction of CD30EV in the supernatant
of embedded cultures might be due to a general EV
retention in the matrix and under retention, EVs might
shed CD30 like the suspended EVs. Only comparing
metalloproteinase inhibited aliquots, we measured 5.7-fold
more CD30EV (P = 0.0003, N = 4) in the supernatants
of suspended than embedded aliquots, clearly indicating
that EVs are strongly retained in the matrix. However,
when we evaluated the effect of metalloproteinases
on matrigel embedded aliquots, we measured 1.9-fold
more CD30EV (P = 0.0153, N = 4) under inhibition.
This indicates that EVs loose CD30ecto by ectodomain
shedding under the observed period of time. Thus,
strongly CD30ecto-depleted EVs leave the matrix. This
depletion was also true for the ADAM10 substrate CD44
(not shown) but not for shedding-insensitive substrates.
As shown by flow cytometry, CD30 lost approximately
50% of its ectodomain. In contrast, the shedding remnant
cytoplasmic portion of CD30 (CD30endo) or the
metalloproteinase-resistant tetraspanin CD82 and the TNF
superfamily member CD70 (TNFSF7, CD27L) remained
stable on EVs (Figure 3B). Thus, the EVs suffer a loss of
ADAM10-sensitive ectodomains under migration through
the matrigel matrix.
Similar data were received in another model
with CD30+ cells, this time disseminated in large cell
aggregates. This model rather reflects the retention of
EVs by bystander cells. The aggregates released a higher
amount of EVs and a higher percentage of CD30EV in
the surrounding medium when they were suspended
before EV isolation. These data indicate that CD30+ EVs
from large aggregates of normal cells are also retained
by surrounding bystander cells and perform ectodomain
shedding (Supplementary 3).
To test whether our models reflect the release of
CD30 in cHL tissue, we also determined the percentage
of CD30EV in the plasma of cHL patients from the HD16
study. These patients did not receive antibody treatment.
Here we found an even lower percentage of CD30EV
(0.9%, range: 0.2–2.3%, N = 6) than in the supernatant of
embedded cultures (Figure 3C). CD30, is a selective marker
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of cancer cells in cHL tissue and the CD30 serum levels
correlate with the tumor load. We therefore speculate that
sCD30 and CD30EV in the serum originates predominantly
from the tumor. Because of the low percentage of CD30EV
in the serum, we take it as indirect evidence that most CD30
is degraded from EVs before reaching the circulation.

CD30EV guides SGN-35 to cells of the
microenvironment
Next we tested whether cancer cell EVs transport
CD30 to adjacent immune cells and as a consequence
allow SGN-35 binding to CD30-negative cells of the
neighborhood. In a 3D matrigel co-culture of CD30+
(green) and CD30L+ cells (red), vesicle-associated CD30
(CD30EV) was released from the donor cell. Confocal
images demonstrate that the EVs bind to the surface of
the CD30L+ cell (Figure 4A1; white arrow heads) and a
minor portion of the CD30+ EVs is taken up (Figure 4A2;
white ring). We also tested the migration of CD30 to
tumor-supporting bystander cells in cHL tissue. Therefore
naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase (NASDCL, red)
and CD30 (ALEXA 488, green)-positive cells were costained in a 30 µm section of a cHL-affected lymph node
of mixed cellularity sub-type (MC). NASDCL stains
predominantly neutrophils, which express CD30L but not
CD30 [12, 25]. The confocal image shows a strong colocalization of CD30 to a NASDCL+ bystander cell (arrow
head), indicating that CD30 is migrating to bystander cells
in vivo as well (Figure 4B).
Next, we tested if CD30+ cells release EVs that bind
and transport SGN-35. Therefore the CD30+ cHL cell line
L540 was cultivated with biotin-labeled SGN-35, washed
and further cultivated in serum-free suspension culture.
The EV fraction from the supernatant was isolated and
washed by ultracentrifugation. Then, we tested the purified
EVs for the presence of SGN-35. As shown in Figure 4C,
these EVs contained both the biotinylated heavy and the
light chain of SGN-35 indicating that EVs from cancer
cells bind and transport SGN-35 (Figure 4C).
The mast cell line HMC1.2 is CD30-negative but
expresses the CD30 ligand and binds CD30 (Figure 4D,
left). 458 ± 190 U/mL of CD30 were detected in the serum
of cHL patients with progressive disease or relapse [26].
We expect higher concentrations in the malignant tissue,
at the site of origin. Therefore we tested SGN-35 binding
along with sCD30 or CD30EV, both adjusted to 1000
or 3000 U/mL. SGN-35 alone did not bind to the cells
but SGN-35 was binding together with CD30EV. sCD30
was unable to link SGN-35 to HMC-1.2 cells. These
data suggest that cancer cell-derived CD30EVs but not
monomeric sCD30 enable the binding of the anti-CD30
ADC to CD30– but CD30L+ cells, in vitro. Together, these
data support the hypothesis that CD30+ EVs from cancer
cells allow the off-target binding of SGN-35 to bystander
cells of the tumor microenvironment.

3.57 ± 0.66 to 5.79 ± 1.23 for 1 µg/mL of SGN-35 and
from 4.15 ± 1.03 to 8.51 ± 2.46 for 5 µg/mL (N = 4).
Although the %-age clearly increased also with 1 µg/
mL SGN-35, only the experiments with 5 µg/mL SGN35 were statistically significant (Figure 5B). In contrast,
co-incubation with sCD30 was almost ineffective in
this respect. Apoptosis is measured by the expression of
phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the target
cell. EVs generally show a constitutive expression of PS.

Next, we studied whether SGN-35 is able to damage
CD30–/CD30L+ EOL-1 cells with the help of CD30EV.
As indicated by an increase of the propidium iodide (PI)
staining, CD30EV increased the percentage of cells in Q2
in comparison to aliquots without CD30 (Figure 5A and B).
Thus, CD30EVs raised the mean %-age ± SD from

was added. As control, cells were cultivated in suspension on top of 100 µL of cell-free semi-solid matrigel (suspended). After 24 h, the
culture supernatants, without matrigel, were removed and pre-centrifugated to remove cells and cell debris. Then, the supernatant was
ultracentrifugated at 100000 × g for 120 min to sediment the EVs (•). The ultracentrifugation supernatant was isolated and the EV pellet was
suspended in PBS and adjusted to the same volume as the supernatant. (A) The CD30 ectodomain ELISA was used to determine CD30EV
in the PBS-suspended EVs and sCD30 in the ultracentrifugation supernatant. The results show U/mL as means ± SE for four independent

at 4.5 µm-microspheres and aliquots of microspheres were incubated with antibodies as indicated and investigated by flow cytometry. The

responsible for the contact with the environment. As
an example, the integrin pattern on the surface of EVs
participates in the organotropism in metastasis [29]. Many
adhesion proteins and membrane-anchored receptors are
cleaved by ADAM proteinases [30, 31]. Other membrane
proteins are quite resistant such as CD70, CD82 or
tetraspanins and often serve as marker to identify EVs
[32]. Here, we demonstrated catalytically active ADAM10
and the cleavage of CD30 on isolate EVs. Whereas cells
are able to substitute shed membrane proteins, EVs cannot
synthesize and replace the cleaved protein. This leads to
a slow-acting depletion of metalloproteinase-sensitive
proteins.
In tissue, when EVs diffuse from the releasing
cell, this time-dependent loss of cleavable proteins might

DISCUSSION
Ectodomain shedding on EVs
We are only beginning to understand the whole
range of EV functions. In cancer, opposing effects such as
suppression of malignant cells or stimulation of metastasis
have been described [27, 28]. Depending on the type and
activation status of the releasing cell, variable amounts
of EVs are liberated with a variable load of proteins and
nucleic acids. Whereas luminal microRNA influences
the fate of the recipient cell, the surface proteins are

the functions of shedding-resistant proteins persist even
distant from the releasing cell (Figure 6). This hypothesis
has consequences for a use of EVs as biomarker in body
fluids. Instable ectodomains of proteins are unreliable
biomarkers in body fluids. Instead, stable tumorcharacteristic proteins and in particular the luminal
microRNA are more reliable to monitor the progression
of a distant malignancy. Thus, characteristic RNA and
the tumor-specific EGFRvIII could be detected in serum
EVs of glioblastoma patients [33]. The prognostic value
of such serum EVs is currently under investigation [34].
Although EVs were first described in cHL, there is
to the best of my knowledge no study available on the
prognostic value of serum EVs in cHL [35]. Recently,
circulating cell-free microRNA was suggested to have a
prognostic value in cHL but association with EVs was
not shown [36]. CD30endo might be a promising plasma
biomarker, because it seems to be stably detectable by
both novel antibodies, even after ectodomain cleavage.
However, CD30endo is problematic for another reason.

A splice variant of CD30, comprising only the CD30
cytoplasmic domain is not a typical cHL protein. It is
found in other cells, such as alveolar macrophages, acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative disorders
(MBC) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [21].
We are currently investigating CD30endo as a plasma EV
biomarker for cHL and other diseases.

Role of CD30EV in bystander cell targeting by
SGN-35
The desired function of SGN-35 is to bind to CD30
on cancer cells and subsequently kill them. CD30EV
and sCD30 bind SGN-35 and compete with tumor cell
CD30. The competition impact was not tested and can
only be estimated. The released antigens are probably
different in the strength of their antibody binding.
sCD30 is monomeric and exposes only one epitope.
The simultaneous binding of two linked epitopes such
as cell or EV-associated CD30 results in much stronger
binding forces. Therefore, SGN-35 might favor antigens

Figure 6: Proposed model for the role of EVs and CD30 shedding for the immunotargeting with SGN-35. The malignant

cells in cHL reside in lymphoid tissue, surrounded by a microenvironment of extracellular matrix and proinflammatory cells. They
selectively express the receptor CD30. The CD30 antibody-drug conjugate SGN-35 binds to the CD30+ tumor cells, is internalized and
the toxic compound is cleaved and activated by lysosomal proteases. The malignant cells not only expose CD30 on the surface, they also
release CD30 on EVs (CD30EV), either by membrane blebbing or release of exosomes from multivesicular endosomes. EVs also bind
SGN-35 and SGN-35-loaded EVs migrate away from the cancer cell. The loading of EVs might also occur within the tumor cell. After
SGN-35 internalization, the drug might target to multivesicular endosomes instead of lysosomes. Apoptotic blebs of damaged tumor cells
might contribute to the release of SGN-35-loaded EVs. Mast cells and eosinophils support the cHL tumor growth. These cells express the
natural CD30 ligand and bind SGN-35-loaded CD30EV. These cells might internalize the EVs and are damaged by SGN-35 in a CD30EVdependend manner. Cells and EVs express the CD30 sheddase ADAM10, which gradually cleaves the ectodomain. In the microenvironment,
sCD30 is quickly drained whereas EVs are retained. Monomeric sCD30 is a competitor of SGN35 binding to cells and EVs. This hypothesis
suggests an elevated ratio of membrane-associated CD30 within the matrix and an elevated ratio of sCD30 outside of the matrix. SGN-35
exploits this mechanism to preferentially target cancer and bystander cells in the tumor microenvironment. The CD30-depleted EVs and
the high level of competing sCD30 in the circulation might explain the minute side-effects of the drug.

that are membrane-associated. Consequently, CD30EV
is a stronger competitor than sCD30. It appears from the
confocal images that CD30EV concentrates around the
CD30L-positive bystander cells. These sites are expected
to bind SGN-35 with a similar avidity as the CD30+ cancer
cells. Cells with strong CD30 expression yield 1000 U
CD30 from 106 cells [6]. We were only able to isolate 70
U CD30 on EVs (14 U from 2 × 105 cells). Therefore,
CD30EV is a probably a competitor with high avidity
but there is less CD30EV than cell-associated CD30 in
tissue. However, it is not only the avidity of the antigen
that counts. High concentrations of sCD30 might reduce
the SGN-35 binding to the major antigens. In SCID mice
with a L540 xenotransplant, metalloproteinase inhibition
reduced the serum sCD30 level significantly and improved
the tumor therapy with a CD30 immunotoxin [37].
All CD30 antibodies raised against the ectodomain
define three major serological clusters (A-C) [38]. The
murine antibody backbone of SGN-35 (C10) was allocated
to cluster C, along with the inhibitory (HeFi-1) and the
agonistic (M44) CD30 antibodies [38], suggesting that the
SGN-35 epitope is involved in the ligand binding or close
to it. In contrast to Ki-1 mAb (cluster B), which binds to
an epitope distant from the CD30L binding site, SGN-35
was not able to bind to CD30L by sCD30 bridging (Figure
4) [7]. Thus, the ADC can only bind to CD30L+ cells,
when they provide free SGN-35 epitopes, as EVs can do.
This might explain the failure of sCD30 to communicate
SGN-35 binding to bystander cells.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study
that presents the hypothesis that EVs help to damage
bystander cells by translocation of a tumor-associated
antigen. So far, we focused on the CD30/CD30L axis
and on cHL, because CD30 is very selective for certain
diseases and CD30L is expressed on cHL-typical tumorsupporting bystander cells. However, EVs do not transport
CD30 alone. Mass spectrometry of EVs from cHL cell
lines identified various integrins, adhesion protein (not
shown). Such molecules might participate as co-receptors
in EV binding because the integrin pattern also determines
the organotropism of EVs in glioblastoma [29].
The CD30/CD30L axis is not selective for cHL. In
adults, CD30 is also overexpressed in other malignancies,
such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL),
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Sézary syndrome, Mycosis
fungoides), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and
certain autoimmune diseases. Some of which are evaluated
in clinical studies with SGN-35 [39]. Because most cells
release EVs it is possible that CD30EV is also released in
these cases, but it is not shown yet. The presence of tumorsupporting CD30L-positive bystander cells is another
question. In addition to mast cells and granulocytes,
CD30L is also expressed on subsets of activated T and B
cells [12, 40, 41]. The EV interaction with the latter was
not tested so far. Nevertheless, a mast cell infiltrate has
been described in DLBCL [42] and hypereosinophilia are
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

shown in different T-cell lymphomas [43]. The treatment
of such malignancies might profit from the EV-based
cross-fire effect of SGN-35.
Together, we provide a hypothesis that explains
the powerful clinical efficacy of SGN-35 (Figure 6). The
anti-CD30 ADC SGN-35 is not only able to bind and
damage CD30+ cancer cells but also CD30– cells when
loaded with CD30+ EVs from the cancer cell. However,
EVs gradually loose this mobile targeting structure by
ectodomain shedding on the pathway through the matrix
or cell aggregates to the circulation. We suggest that this
loss confines the bridging functionality of EVs to cells
of the close microenvironment of the cancer cells. This
model explains the high anti-tumor and low systemic
efficacy of SGN-35.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and reagents
The CD30+ cHL cell lines L540, L428, KM-H2
and L1236, the CD30– cHL cell line HD-MyZ and the
acute myeloid (eosinophil) leukemia line EOL-1 were
purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). The
mast cell line HMC-1 was from Dr. J. Butterfield (Mayo
Clinic, Rochester MN). Cells were cultivated in RPMI1640 or IMDM (HMC-1) containing 10% FCS, penicillin,
streptomycin and 50 µM ß-mercaptoethanol. EV-depleted
FCS was generated by overnight centrifugation at
100000 × g. The CD30 monoclonal antibodies Ki-2, Ki-3
were generated as described [38, 44, 45]. The goat antihuman Fc Ab (GaH-IgG) was from Dianova (Hamburg,
Germany) and the metalloproteinase inhibitor (BB3644)
was from British Biotech Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Oxford,
U.K.). The ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X was kindly
provided by Dr. A Ludwig, Aachen, Germany. The
fluorescence resonance energy transfer metalloproteinase
substrates PEPDAB010 and PEPMCA001 were from
BioZyme Inc. (Apex, NC). Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were isolated from buffy coats from the local blood
bank. The testing of plasma samples from cHL patients
was approved by the local Ethics Committee (HD16 study,
reference 09/039).

Determination of CD30endo by ELISA
Microtiter plates (MaxiSorb, Nunc) were coated with
50 µL of Ki-12 mAb (10 µg/mL in sodium carbonate buffer,
50 mM, pH 9.2) by overnight incubation at 4°C. The plates
were washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing
5% milk powder for 1 h and subsequently stored at –20°C
until used. After triplicate washing with PBS containing
0.02% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween 20), serial dilutions of a
CD30 standard and the CD30-containing samples were
added and incubated at RT for 2 h. Plates were washed
four times with PBS/Tween 20 and 50 µL of biotin-labeled
30532

Oncotarget

Flow cytometry

Ki-10 mAb was added and incubated for 1 h at RT. After
washing, the plates were incubated for 40 min with 50 µL
of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, washed
and peroxidase activity was developed with TMB solution
(Thermo Fisher). The reaction was stopped with 0.16 M
sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

HMC 1.2 or EoL-1 cells (5 × 105/ml) were incubated
for 1 h on ice with sCD30, ultracentrifugation-enriched
CD30-containing EVs or HBSS buffer alone. After
washing with PBS containing 1% albumin and 0.1%
sodium azide, cells were incubated for another 30 min
on ice with FITC-coupled SGN-35 (0.1 µg/ml). After
washing in the above PBS, cells were evaluated by flow
cytometry. Vesicles alone were incubated overnight with
polybead carboxylate microspheres (4.5 µm; Polysciences
INC, Warrington, PA). The beads were blocked with 1%
BSA (v/w) in PBS. Then, aliquots were incubated with
unlabeled or fluorescence-labeled antibodies. Aliquots
with unlabeled antibody were in a second step labeled with
fluorescence-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg,
Germany). Beads were evaluated by flow cytometry.

Plasmids
Construction of the CD30L-DsRed2 plasmid: Human
CD30L (CD153, isoform 1) was amplified by PCR from
the cDNA of DG75 cells using the BglII forward primer
5ʹ-actcagatctcgagGAATGGACCCAGGGCTGCAGCAA
GCA-3ʹ and the BamHI reverse complement primer
5ʹ-tgagaggatccTCAGTCTGAATTACTGTATAAGAAGA
TGGACA-3ʹ to clone the PCR product into the
BglII and BamH1 restricted expression vector
pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech, CA). Construction of the
CD30-eGFP expression plasmid: The CD30 cDNA
was amplified from CD30-pcDNA3 plasmid [46]
using the HindIII forward primer 5ʹ-gcgagaagcttAT
GCGCGTCCTCCTCGCCGCG-3ʹ and the BamHI
reverse complement primer 5ʹ-tcgtaggatccCCCTTT
CCAGAGGCAGCTGTGGG-3ʹ. This PCR product
was cloned into the HindIII/BamHI restricted plasmid
pEGFP-C1 (Clontech CA).

Toxicity of SGN-35
Cells were incubated for 96 h with sCD30, CD30EV
and SGN-35 as indicated. Then, cells were washed and
incubated for 15 min at room temperature in annexin V
binding buffer containing 0.8 µg/ml annexin V and 0.5 µg/
ml propidium iodide. After washing, cells were evaluated
by flow cytometry.

Western blot

Transfection

Whole vesicle lysates generated after 2 min boiling
with SDS sample buffer and cell-free supernatants were
developed in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose.
Membranes were blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v)
fat-free dry milk and then incubated at 4°C with ADAM10
or Biotin-coupled SGN-35 mAbs (1 µg/mL each) and
finally stained with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse
IgG or streptavidin, respectively. ECL-reagent was used
as substrate (GE Healthcare).

HD-MyZ cells (1 × 105 /ml) were allowed
to adhere; HMC-1.1 cells were immobilized and
cultivated on a fibronectin-coated surface (15 µg/ml).
Medium was removed and 400 µl medium (RPMI1640 or IMDM medium, respectively) + 2% FCS
was added. DNA (0.8 µg DNA/50 µl Opti-MEM I;
Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine 2000 (1 µl/50 µl OptiMEM I; Invitrogen) were prepared separately and
incubated for 5 min. Then, DNA and Lipofectamine
solutions were mixed and incubated for 20 min
before being added to the cells. Cells were incubated for
24 h before use. After 12 h, the medium was exchanged
and cells were cultivated in their standard medium. This
protocol was up-scaled to transfect more cells.

were collected and cleared by five consecutive
centrifugation steps, i.e. 5 min at 200 × g, 15 min at 2000
× g, 2 times 15  min at 3500 × g and finally 30 min at
10000 × g. Cleared supernatants were sedimented in an
ultracentrifuge, for 2 h at 100000 × g. Pellets and the final
supernatants were collected. Vesicle fraction-containing
pellets were washed with PBS by ultracentrifugation for
two hours.
