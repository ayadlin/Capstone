BACKGROUND. Several attempts have been made at improving the efficacy of
gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer by combining it with other chemotherapeutic or molecularly targeted agents. However, randomized trials have
produced conflicting results.

METHODS. All prospective, randomized, phase 3 trials that compared single-agent
gemcitabine with gemcitabine-based combinations were considered eligible for
the current analysis. A literature-based meta-analysis was performed, event-based
relative risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were derived through both a
fixed-effect model approach and a random-effect model approach, and overall
survival (OS) was explored as the primary endpoint. To estimate the magnitude
of the eventual benefit, absolute differences and the number of patients needed
to treat (NNT) for 1 patient to benefit were calculated. A sensitivity analysis for
OS was performed according to the type of agent used in combination with gemcitabine.

RESULTS. Twenty trials that involved 6296 patients were identified. No significant
differences in the primary endpoint were observed in the overall population or in
the sensitivity analysis. Conversely, a significant advantage was evident with
regard to both progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall response rate
(ORR) in the overall population, with an absolute benefit of 2.6% (NTT 5 39
patients) and 3.0% (NNT 5 33 patients). Platinum combinations led to the greatest absolute benefits for PFS and ORR compared with single-agent gemcitabine
(10% and 6.5%, respectively), but this did not result in an OS benefit. Improvement in PFS, but not in the ORR, was correlated with an improvement in OS.

CONCLUSIONS. Single-agent gemcitabine remains the standard of care for patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer. However, platinum/gemcitabine combinations
appeared to improve PFS and the ORR and, thus, may be considered in selected
patients. Cancer 2007;110:525–33.  2007 American Cancer Society.

ancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease, and its
mortality closely approaches its incidence. Indeed, pancreatic
cancer accounted for an estimated 33,730 newly diagnosed cancers
and [32,000 estimated deaths in the United States alone in 2006, representing the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in both
sexes.1 Because of the combination of late-stage disease at presentation (localized, 8%; regional, 26%; metastatic, 52%) and intrinsic resistance to conventional treatments, it may be argued that PDAC has
the worst overall prognosis among solid tumors, with 5-year survival
rates that do not exceed 5%. Even in the small percentage of patients

who present with localized disease and, thus, are
amenable to surgery with curative intent, long-term
survival barely exceeds 15%.1 In patients with
advanced, inoperable disease, the objectives of systemic treatment are palliative: Weekly treatment with
gemcitabine (G) (Gemzar; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind)
at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 infused over 30 minutes provides a small but statistically significant overall advantage over bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in terms of both
clinical benefit response (23.8% vs 4.8%; P 5 .0022)
and survival (median survival, 5.65 months vs 4.41
months; P 5 .0025) and currently is considered the
treatment of choice for patients with inoperable disease.2 Building upon the favorable toxicity profile of
G, in the past 10 years, many attempts have been
made to improve outcomes by combining it with a
number of other chemotherapeutic agents. Results
from phase 3 trials, however, have failed to demonstrate convincingly the superiority of doublet regimens over single-agent G, although agents with
different mechanism of action have been combined
(platinum salts, fluoropyrimidines, and camptothecines). The overall negative results with G-based combinations generally have been attributed to a lack of
statistical power to detect small differences in survival. Although this hypothesis may be supported by
the observation that hazard ratios (HRs) for survival
were similar across trials, although significant differences were not always demonstrated,3,4 such conflicting results called for a cumulative analysis that could
detect real survival differences, albeit small, with adequate statistical power.
More recently, possible improvements in treatment efficacy also have been explored using novel,
molecularly targeted agents, which were introduced
in the clinical setting in the past 10 years. However,
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the
addition of matrix metalloprotease inhibitors (MMPI), farnesyl-transferase inhibitors (FTI), epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, and antigastrin vaccines to single-agent G largely have been
disappointing.5–9 To assess the potential benefit in efficacy and activity of G-based combinations, including both classic cytotoxics and molecularly targeted
agents, over standard single-agent G for the first-line
treatment of advanced, inoperable PDAC, a literaturebased meta-analysis of all randomized trials that
explored this topic was performed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Endpoint Definition
We considered the G-based combination systemic
therapy arm as the experimental arm and the single-

agent G arm as the standard comparator. Analyses
were conducted to detect possible significant differences in primary and secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint for the analysis of the magnitude of
eventual benefit was overall survival (OS), which was
defined as the time (in months) between randomization and death from any cause. Secondary endpoints
were 1) progression-free survival (PFS), which was
defined as the time (in months) between randomization and either disease progression or death from
any cause; and 2) the overall response rate (ORR)
according to the World Health Organization definition.10

Search Strategy
The deadline for trial publication to be eligible for
the current analysis was November 30, 2006. Updated results of eligible RCTs were gathered through
Medline (PubMed: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed),
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (www.
asco.org), European Society for Medical Oncology,
(ESMO) (www.esmo.org), and Federation of European
Cancer Societies (www.fecs.be) website searches. The
following keywords used in the search: pancreas,
advanced, chemotherapy, gemcitabine, metastatic,
palliative, review, metanalysis, meta-analysis, pooled
analysis, randomized, phase 3, comprehensive review, systematic review. In addition to the online
search, references from reviews and original articles
also were scanned to capture missing clinical trial
data that met our eligibility criteria. Furthermore,
presentations at major international meetings that
had advanced pancreatic cancer as the main topic
were checked. No language restrictions were applied.
We gathered all phase 3 prospective and randomized
trials that were published as formal articles in peerreviewed journals or that were presented as abstracts
at ASCO, European Cancer Conference, or ESMO
meetings up to the end of November 2006 in which
previously untreated patients were randomized to
receive single-agent G (control arm) or G in combination with a different chemotherapeutic agent or a
new targeted agent (experimental arm).
Data Extraction and Synthesis
From each arm within each trial, the number of
deaths, progressions, and responses were obtained.
All data were reviewed and computed separately by 2
independent investigators. The log of the relative risk
ratio (RR) was estimated for each considered endpoint, and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was
derived.11,12 By using this method, it was possible to
apply both a fixed-effect model and a random-effect
model according to the inverse variance and the

Mantel-Haenzel method. To test for heterogeneity
between trials, the Q statistic was used. Patients were
accounted and filled into 2 3 2 tables using the
intention-to-treat assignment where applicable. The
random-effect estimation was preferred in the presence of significant heterogeneity. To test for effect
robustness and to identify the contribution of different drug classes to the effects of the combinations, a
sensitivity analysis was performed in 4 different subpopulations according to the combination drug: G
plus a platinum salt (P-G), G plus a fluoropyrimidine
(F-G), G plus other classic cytotoxic agents (other-G),
and G plus molecularly targeted agents (ND-G). Absolute benefits for each outcome were calculated as
follows: (absolute benefit 5 exp [RR 3 log(control
survival)] 2 control survival).13 The number of patients needed to treat for a single patient to benefit
was determined (NNT: 1/[(absolute benefit)/100]).14
The pooled analysis calculations were determined by using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software, version 1.0.23 (CMA; Biostat, Englewood, NJ),12
Potential correlations between OS and surrogate endpoints (ORR and PFS) were explored according to a
linear regression model considering both the actual
outcome for each single arm and the calculated relative risk (RR) for each outcome in paired comparisons. Correlations were estimated according to the
Pearson (r) and R2 coefficients (parametric) and the
Spearman (q) coefficient (nonparametric). Because

differences in median OS across the trials that were
included in the current analysis ranged from 0.4
months to 1.5 months, a model also was derived to
calculate the target sample size to correctly identify
0.4-, 0.7-, and 1.5-month benefits in OS using PFS as
a surrogate endpoint.

RESULTS
Selected Trials
Twenty RCTs were identified that accrued 6296
patients who were randomized to receive singleagent G versus any G-based combination (Table 1).
All selected RCTs reported OS data and, thus, were
eligible for the primary endpoint analysis. P-G combinations were evaluated in 7 RCTs that involved
1354 patients (cisplatin in 4 RCTs that involved 382
patients; cisplatin, epirubicin, and 5-FU in 1 RCT
that involved 104 patients; and oxaliplatin in 2 RCTs
that involved 868 patients).3,15–19 For Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E6201, which randomized
patients between standard-infusion G, fixed-doserate G, and oxaliplatin plus G, only the standardinfusion G and oxaliplatin plus G arms were considered for the current analysis.20 F-G combinations
were evaluated in 5 RCTs that involved 1659 patients
(5-FU with or without folinic acid in 2 RCTs that
involved 788 patients, capecitabine in 2 RCTs that
involved 852 patients, and uracyl-tegafur in 1 RCT

that involved 19 patients).4,20–23 Other-G combinations were evaluated in 4 RCTs involved 1404
patients; the combination drugs were topoisomerase
I inhibitors in 3 RCTs (irinotecan in 2 RCTs that
involved 490 patients and exatecan in 1 RCT that
involved 349 patients) and pemetrexed (in 1 RCT
that involved 565 patients).24–27 Four additional trials
randomized 1879 patients to receive G versus ND-G,
including the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor
(MMP-I) marimastat (239 patients),7 the FTI tipifarnib (688 patients),5 the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib (569
patients),28 and the antigastrin vaccine G17DT (383
patients).9 Three of the 20 RCTs that were selected
reported a statistically significant OS benefit for the
experimental arm.4,15,28 The range of patient accrual
to the individual trials included in our analysis was
from 19 patients to 688 patients. At the time of our
survey, 11 RCTs were published in extenso, and 9
were available in an abstract/presentation form.

Combined Analysis
The combined results from all trials that compared
single-agent G versus any G-based combination are
summarized in Table 2, and the Forest plot for OS is
shown in Figure 1. For the primary endpoint of OS,
no significant differences were observed between single-agent G and G-based combinations (RR, 0.93;
95% CI, 0.84–1.03; P 5 .17) with no significant heterogeneity (P 5 .99). Conversely, the analysis of PFS
slightly but significantly favored the combination
arm, with an RR of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P 5 .015)
without significant heterogeneity (P 5 .29); this difference translated into a 2.6% absolute benefit
(NNT 5 39 patients). A similar advantage for Gbased combinations was observed in terms of the
ORR (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.31–1.86; P < .0001); and,
although heterogeneity was observed between different trials (P 5 .026), the difference in favor of the

combination arm remained significant utilizing a
random-effect model (Table 2). This difference translated into a 3% absolute ORR benefit (NNT 5 33
patients).

Sensitivity Analysis
The impact of different classes of cytotoxic/molecularly targeted agents was explored further by clustering the selected RCTs into 4 separate groups (P-G, FG, other-G, and ND-G). Figure 1 shows that none of
the combined treatment groups demonstrated a significant OS advantage compared with single-agent G,
with no significant heterogeneity among different
trials. Platinum-containing combinations homogeneously demonstrated a significant advantage in
terms of PFS (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53–0.83; P 5 .0004)
and ORR (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.32–2.37; P 5 .0001) (Table 3). These differences translated into a 10% absolute PFS benefit (NNT 5 10 patients) and a 6.5%
absolute ORR benefit (NNT 5 15 patients), respectively, for P-G combinations (Table 3). A similar ORR
effect was observed for other-G combinations (RR,
1.96; 95% CI, 1.41–2.93; P 5 .0005) that did not translate into a PFS or OS benefit (data not shown). A
trend toward improved PFS was observed for the F-G
group (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73–1.02).
Correlation Between Primary and Secondary Endpoints
We explored correlations between primary and secondary endpoints among the trials that were
included in our analysis. Nineteen RCTs that involved
6288 patients and 17 RCTs that involved 4882
patients were identified for the ORR/OS and PFS/OS
correlation, respectively. When considering RRs, the
ORR did not correlate significantly with OS (r 5
20.17 and R2 5 0.03, P 5 .46; q 5 20.18, P 5 .44)
(Fig. 2), whereas PFS showed a strong linear correlation (r 5 0.91 and R2 5 0.82, P < .0001; q 5 0.59,

Individual trials have been grouped according to the combination drug for the sensitivity analysis.

Note that risk ratios (RR) are to be interpreted as follows: with regard to the endpoints of OS and progression-free survival, an RR
<1.0 indicates fewer events (deaths or progressions) in the experimental arm and, thus, favors the combination; with regard to the endpoint of objective
response rate, a RR <1.0 indicates fewer objective responses in the experimental arm and, thus, favors single-agent G.

mount importance in the evaluation of therapeutic
progress in pancreatic cancer, in which multiple factors other than sample size, such as inherent chemoresistance and poor patient performance status,
may obscure the potential advantages of multiagent
chemotherapy.
One possible interpretation of the results from
RCTs is that single-agent G remains the standard of
care in advanced PDAC, given the absence of a
reported benefit for combination therapy in the majority of trials, the large NNT required to observe 1 benefit, and the poor performance status of most patients.
However, a significant benefit in terms of activity generally was believed sufficient to introduce G-based
doublets (especially doublets that contained platinum
salts or fluoropyrimidines) as one of the front-line
options for clinical practice, as reflected by their inclusion into several guidelines. Therefore, we believed
that a cumulative analysis could help put such discrepancies in perspective and allow verification or rejection of the hypothesis that there was a beneficial effect
of combination therapy with adequate statistical
power. Based on the results of the current meta-analysis, which included all phase 3 trials that compared G
with G-based combinations, single-agent G remains
the standard of care for advanced pancreatic cancer.
Indeed, no statistical difference in OS, which was our
primary endpoint, was observed in favor of the combination arm. Similar results have been reported recently
by the Cochrane Collaboration Group.29 In that metaanalysis, despite a significant 6-month survival benefit

DISCUSSION
Since the introduction of G as first-line treatment for
advanced pancreatic cancer in 1997,2 many attempts
have been made to improve on the results obtained
with single-agent chemotherapy. A number of randomized studies combining G with other chemotherapeutic agents, mostly in doublets, have been
conducted with conflicting results. More recently,
novel molecularly targeted agents also have been
tested in combination with G. Although only 3 of the
studies that we considered for the current meta-analysis reported a survival advantage in favor of the
combination arm,4,15,28 a better ORR was observed in
the majority of trials, and the overall negative results
in terms of OS have been attributed largely to a lack
of statistical power to detect small but significant differences. For example, both in the French Multidisciplinary Cooperative Oncology Group/Italian Group
for the Study of Digestive Tract Cancer intergroup
trial, which evaluated the combination of G and oxaliplatin,3 and in the trial conducted by Cunningham
et al., who evaluated the combination of G and capecitabine,4 a comparably significant ORR benefit was
observed, but only in the latter trial was a statistically
significant survival advantage observed, possibly by
virtue of a more adequately powered sample size
(533 patients vs 313 patients). This issue is of para-

in favor of platinum-based combinations, no significant advantage at 6 months or 12 months was determined when all trials were included. Even in the most
favorable group (ie, those who received the platinumbased regimen), the survival trend was not maintained
at 12 months. Strikingly different results have been
reported recently by Heinemann et al.30: in their metaanalysis, they observed a slightly significant OS benefit
in favor of combinations, particularly those that contained a platinum salt or a fluoropyrimidine, over
standard G. Methodological issues may explain the
apparently discrepant results achieved by our current
meta-analysis and that of Heinemann et al. First, we
systematically excluded Phase II randomized trials.31
Second, the statistical methodology applied by Heinemann et al. differed from ours in the selection of effect
measurement (HR vs RR).30 On closer inspection, however, the results obtained by these 3 meta-analyses
using different statistical approaches and trial-selection criteria ultimately convey a common message:
The overall reduction in the risk of death obtained by
using combination regimens is minimal in all 3 studies
(RR: 0.88, 0.91, and 0.93 for the Cochrane Collaboration
Group study, Heinemann et al’s study, and the current
meta-analysis, respectively). The interpretation of
these results from a clinical standpoint would be that
the improvement attainable with G-based combinations is small and has to be weighed against the
increased toxicity of combination regimens,32 an issue
that has to be taken into account when considering
different therapeutic options in the palliative setting of
advanced PDAC treatment.
It is disappointing that the introduction of new,
molecularly targeted agents has had little impact on
the survival of patients with advanced PDAC. Rather
than leading to the dismissal of the combination of
targeted agents with G as ineffective, these results
call for an in-depth analysis of potential reasons for
failure. The first reason may be the choice of agents,
such as MMP-I, that largely are ineffective as single
agents; indeed, combined analysis of the 2 randomized studies in head-to-head comparisons of MMP-I
with G uniformly demonstrated a significantly worse
outcome for patients who were allocated to experimental treatment (RR for OS 1.45; 95% CI; 1.01–2.10;
P 5 .04 and RR for ORR .14; 95% CI; .05–.40; P <
.0001, respectively; data not shown. P 5 .14, 95% CI;
.05–.40, P < .0001, respectively; data not shown).33
Second, the chosen agent may fail to hit its putative
target(s): This appears to be the case for FTIs, which
may fail to block K-Ras activity effectively because of
alternative activation pathways, such as geranyl-geranylation.34 General methodological issues, such as
insufficient target validation, inadequate Phase II

531

testing, and a rush to bring new compounds into
phase 3 trials, also may have contributed to the general failure of new approaches to have an impact on
the survival of patients with PDAC. At the moment,
the most promising among the therapeutic strategies
that employ molecularly targeted agents appears to
be the addition of EGFR-targeted drugs to G. Indeed,
in the second largest trial among all 20 RCTs that
were considered in the current analysis,28 a small but
statistically significant OS advantage was observed
for the combination of erlotinib and G compared
with standard, single-agent G.
The usefulness of the response rate as a surrogate endpoint for survival is hotly debated. Indeed,
response according to the Response Criteria in Solid
Tumors may be difficult to determine in PDAC, in
which the evaluation of disease response in the
locally advanced setting may be obscured by extensive desmoplasia and inflammatory changes; moreover, the accuracy and usefulness of objective tumor
shrinkage in the evaluation of novel therapeutics
with predominantly cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic,
activity has been challenged. In that respect, the
finding of a lack of correlation between ORR and OS
suggests that PFS is a more reliable surrogate marker
for survival in advanced PDAC trials; other surrogate
markers, such as a drop in CA19.9 serum levels during treatment,35,36 may prove useful but will require
prospective validation.
Overall, the results of the current meta-analysis
do not indicate a significant impact of multiagent,
systemic treatments on the survival of patients with
advanced PDAC and do not support their routine use
in clinical practice despite the observed advantage in
terms of ORR and PFS. In view of the potential limitations of literature-based meta-analyses and of the
conflicting results reported by other authors using
similar approaches,29,30,32 we believe that a metaanalysis based on individual patient data would be of
great value. Although progress in the systemic treatment of patients with advanced PDAC in the past 10
years appears to be small, rather than fostering therapeutic nihilism, the current data should prompt a
profound revision of our approach to clinical research in pancreatic cancer37 that takes into account
the need for identification of novel targets, more
accurate preclinical/early clinical target validation,
more extensive and innovative Phase II testing, and
identification and validation of alternative surrogate
markers for clinical efficacy.
