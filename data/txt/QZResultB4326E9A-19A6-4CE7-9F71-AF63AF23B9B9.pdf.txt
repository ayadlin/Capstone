BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of postmastectomy breast reconstruction on
the timing of chemotherapy. METHODS: The authors included stage I-III breast cancer patients from 8 National Comprehensive Cancer Network institutions for whom guidelines recommended chemotherapy. Surgery type was categorized as breast-conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy alone, mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (M þ IR),
or mastectomy with delayed reconstruction (M þ DR). A Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association
between surgery type and timing of chemotherapy initiation. RESULTS: Of the 3643 patients, only 5.1% received it 8
weeks from surgery. In the multivariate analysis, higher stage, Caucasian and Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower body
mass index, and absence of comorbid conditions were all significantly associated with earlier time to chemotherapy.
There was also significant interaction among age, surgery, and chemotherapy delivery. Among women <60, time to
chemotherapy was shorter for all surgery types compared with M þ IR (statistical significant for all surgery types in
the youngest age group and for BCS in women 40 to <50 years old). In contrast, among women 60, time to chemotherapy was shorter among women receiving M þ IR or M þ DR compared with those undergoing BCS or mastectomy alone, a difference that was statistically significant for the M þ IR versus BCS comparison. CONCLUSIONS:
Immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction does not appear to lead to omission of chemotherapy, but it is
associated with a modest, but statistically significant, delay in initiating treatment. For most, it is unlikely that this

Postmastectomy breast reconstruction is an integral part of breast cancer care. Breast reconstruction, especially
when performed at the time of the mastectomy, has been associated with improved psychosocial well-being and high levels
of patient satisfaction.1-5 In particular, reconstruction can have a positive influence on women’s body image, sexuality,
and social well-being, thus having a long-term impact in the cancer survivorship period.6 However, less than 20%
of women receive reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy.7 There is also wide geographic variation in the use of
reconstruction, raising the concern that there may be unmet need and access barriers to reconstructive surgery.7,8
One barrier to the use of immediate breast reconstruction—that is reconstruction performed at the time of mastectomy—is the concern that complications of reconstruction may unduly delay the initiation of systemic chemotherapy or
lead to its omission altogether.9 Adjuvant chemotherapy in appropriately selected breast cancer patients is a life-saving
intervention. Delay in initiating adjuvant treatment may compromise its effectiveness, and omitting it will have even
more serious consequences.10
Little is known about the impact of immediate breast reconstruction on the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Immediate breast reconstruction offers better esthetic results, cushions the psychological impact of the breast amputation, and decreases healthcare costs by decreasing the number of operations the patient requires.3,9,11,12 However,
immediate reconstruction is associated with higher surgical complication rates compared with those performed after the

mastectomy,13 which could delay the timing of chemotherapy delivery, and might lead some patients to forego
chemotherapy altogether. Previous studies have not found
an association between immediate breast reconstruction
and delayed chemotherapy14-21; however, these have been
small, single-center studies with limited ability to generalize to other healthcare settings because of the high variability of surgical techniques and patient-level factors
across medical centers. Furthermore, these studies have
looked exclusively at the timing of chemotherapy among
treated patients, so they could not determine whether
reconstruction had an effect on the use of adjuvant
therapy.
We sought to examine the impact of breast reconstruction on the delivery of chemotherapy using a large,
multicenter cohort of patients. Specifically, we wanted to
1) describe the effect of the primary surgery type on the
use and timing of adjuvant therapy, controlling for patient
factors, and 2) identify factors associated with a significant
delay or omission of adjuvant chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Our study population comprised 3643 women with stage
I-III unilateral breast cancer who were treated at 1 of the 8
participating National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) institutions between July 1, 1997 and December 31, 2003 for whom NCCN guidelines recommended
adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were eligible for this
analysis if they received their definitive surgery at the
NCCN institution and continued to receive their care
there for at least 1 year after first presentation. The database includes information on receipt of chemotherapy
regardless of the administering institution for patients
who continue to be seen in the NCCN center. We limited
the sample to patients for whom the version of the
NCCN guidelines in effect at the time of their diagnosis
recommended adjuvant chemotherapy.22,23 This was
done for 2 reasons. First, we were not interested in capturing information on whether type of surgery resulted in
delayed initiation of a treatment that was not indicated.
Second, defining our cohort by clinical indication rather
than chemotherapy administration allowed us to examine
the effect of surgery type not just on the timing but also
on the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who
received 1) neoadjuvant systemic or radiation therapy (N
¼ 635), 2) radiation therapy before initiation of adjuvant
therapy (N ¼ 34), or 3) breast reconstruction more than a

1792

day after completion of their primary surgery but before
the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy (N ¼ 8) were not
eligible for this analysis, because these patterns of care
would confound an analysis of the relationship between
primary surgery type and time to initiation of adjuvant
treatment. Institutional Review Board approval was
obtained from each institution.

Measures
All variables used in the analysis were obtained from the
NCCN Breast Cancer Outcomes Project Database. Definitive surgery was assigned after considering all breastdirected surgical procedures and was classified as breastconserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy only, mastectomy
with immediate breast reconstruction (M þ IR), or mastectomy with delayed breast reconstruction (M þ DR).
Reconstruction was considered ‘‘immediate’’ if it was
either started or completed on the same day as the mastectomy, and ‘‘delayed’’ otherwise.
Other variables in the analysis are as follows: type of
reconstructive surgery (implant, pedicle transverse rectus
abdominus myocutaneous flap [TRAM], free TRAM
requiring microvascular surgery, other rotational flap,
and other free flap); NCCN institution; race/ethnicity
(Caucasian, Hispanic, African American, other); median
household income (<$35,426, $35,426-<$44,639,
$44,639-<$58,844, $58,844-$159,538, unknown); age
at diagnosis; body mass index (BMI; <25 kg/m2, 25-35
kg/m2, >35 kg/m2, unknown); American Joint Committee on Cancer stage at diagnosis (I, II, III); tumor size (2
cm, >2-5 cm, >5 cm, unknown); number of positive
lymph nodes (0, 1-3, 4-9, 10, unknown); Charlson
comorbidity score (0,1, 2); NCCN breast cancer guideline that the patient was eligible for based on clinical characteristics; and participation in an adjuvant therapy
clinical trial.
Adjuvant chemotherapy was defined as systemic
cancer-directed therapy given after completion of definitive surgery and before any recurrence. Time to adjuvant
chemotherapy was the interval from the last definitive surgical procedure to the first dose of adjuvant chemotherapy. For the descriptive analyses, time to chemotherapy
was reported as a categorical variable (<8 weeks, 8
weeks, and no chemotherapy). In the logistic model, the
outcome variable was defined as adjuvant chemotherapy
initiated before recurrence. In the time to event multivariable analysis, time to chemotherapy from definitive surgery was analyzed as a continuous variable.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses were conducted with time to treatment as a categorical variable. For the time to event analysis, we first assessed the association of other variables with
the continuous time to chemotherapy variable in univariate Cox regression. On the basis of variables with P < .20,
we then constructed a multivariable Cox proportional
hazards model to assess the impact of type of definitive
surgery on chemotherapy administration, controlling for
other factors. In the results of this analysis, a hazard ratio
(HR) >1 for a particular group indicates that chemotherapy was initiated earlier in that group compared with the
reference category group, whereas a HR <1 indicates that
treatment was delayed compared with the reference category. The final multivariable model included only those
terms significant at P < .05, including significant interactions terms. All analyses were conducted using SAS
V9.1.3 software (Cary, NC). All modeling reports 95%
confidence intervals (CI) and 2-sided P-values. The
assumption of the proportional hazards was tested and
met.

RESULTS
Table 1 displays the study sample characteristics by receipt
of chemotherapy grouped as: early (<8 weeks), late (8
weeks), or no chemotherapy. The majority of patients
(59.2%) had BCS, 21.7% had mastectomy only, 16.4%
had M þ IR, and 2.7% had M þ DR. Of the 696 patients
who had mastectomy with either immediate or delayed
reconstruction, 49.7% had an implant, 22.1% had a free
TRAM flap, and 18.5% had a pedicle TRAM flap. Of the
3643 breast cancer patients for whom NCCN guidelines
recommended adjuvant chemotherapy, 67.4% received it
early (within 8 weeks), 5.1% received it late (8 weeks),
and 27.5% did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy at any
time point. Overall, 98% of patients who received
chemotherapy started the treatment within 12 weeks
postoperatively.
In a logistic model controlling for age, stage, race
and ethnicity, income, comorbidity, BMI, NCCN institution, and NCCN guideline, there was no effect of surgery type on use of adjuvant chemotherapy (P ¼ .33). On
the basis of an a priori hypothesis that the effect might differ by patient age, we also did an analysis to assess for an
interaction between age and surgery type and found no
association.
As shown in Figure 1, the relationship between surgery type and time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy
Cancer

varied by patient age. For patients younger than 50, the
proportion of patients initiating chemotherapy within 8
weeks was lower for M þ IR than for any of the other
treatment approaches. In contrast, among patients over
age 60, patients who opted for mastectomy with either
immediate or delayed reconstruction were more likely to
receive chemotherapy within 8 weeks.
Because of the marked difference in the relationship
between surgery type and chemotherapy by patient age,
the results of univariate analyses are difficult to interpret.
Therefore, in Table 2, we present the multivariable results
of the time to chemotherapy analysis, including interactions between age and surgery type. In this analysis, a hazard ratio >1 indicates that patients in that category were
more likely to receive chemotherapy early than patients in
the reference category. As shown in the table, higher stage,
Caucasian and Hispanic race versus African American,
lower BMI, and absence of comorbid conditions were all
associated with earlier time to chemotherapy. The effect
of surgery type depended on age. Controlling for all other
factors, among women under age 60, time to chemotherapy was shorter for all surgery types compared with M þ
IR. These differences reached statistical significance for all
surgery types in the youngest age group, and for BCS in
women 40-<50 years of age. In contrast, among women
60 years old or older, time to chemotherapy was shorter
among women receiving reconstruction (immediate or
delayed) compared with those undergoing BCS or mastectomy alone, a difference that was statistically significant
for the M_IR versus BCS comparison.
Figure 2 shows the time to treatment for the entire
patient sample by surgery type among women younger
than 60 years of age (Fig. 2A) and age 60 or older (Fig.
2B). Because of the similarity in the multivariable results
across age strata younger than age 60, we aggregated those
patients for this analysis. Among women younger than
age 60, the median time to initiation of treatment was
5.29 weeks for BCS, 5.14 weeks for mastectomy alone,
4.86 weeks for M þ DR, and 6.00 weeks for M þ IR.
Among women 60 and older, fewer than half the women
who received BCS or mastectomy alone received chemotherapy, so there was no median time to treatment initiation for those groups. Median time to treatment for
women who received M þ DR was 7.14 weeks compared
with 8.14 weeks among women treated with M þ IR.
Among the subset of patients who received chemotherapy,
the median time to chemotherapy for those <60 years
and 60 was as follows: 4.86 weeks and 5.43 weeks for
BCS; 5.00 weeks and 5.86 weeks for mastectomy alone;

DISCUSSION
In this large, multicenter cohort of breast cancer patients,
we found that immediate reconstruction did not increase
the chance that adjuvant chemotherapy would be omitted
in women likely to benefit from it. Immediate reconstruction was associated with an increase in the time to chemotherapy initiation compared with all other treatment
strategies among women younger than age 60, but the
magnitude of the delay was quite modest. Among women
younger than age 60, median time to chemotherapy after
mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was 6.00
weeks compared with 5.29 weeks after BCS. In contrast,
among women 60 years old or older, time to chemotherapy was shorter among women receiving reconstruction
(immediate or delayed) compared with those undergoing
BCS or mastectomy alone.
It is highly unlikely that a 1-week delay in the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy that is otherwise administered within proven time frames impacts long-term
survival. In all clinical trials demonstrating effectiveness of
chemotherapy, treatment started within 8 weeks of the
last surgery. There are no data to show improved outcomes when chemotherapy is initiated within shorter
times. The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative group and
the British Columbia Cancer Agency have found no difference in survival between patients given chemotherapy
early, such as 3 weeks, compared with those that received
treatment up to 12 weeks postoperatively.10,24 At the
extreme of starting chemotherapy before surgery (neoadCancer

juvant), available data show no advantage of this early
therapy compared with postoperative therapy started
within 8 weeks of surgery. However, delays older than
3 months have been associated with diminished relapsefree survival and overall survival.10 In our series, 98% of
breast cancer patients who received chemotherapy started
the treatment within 12 weeks postoperatively across all
medical centers and all surgical treatments.
Previous studies have not found immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction to delay the delivery of
adjuvant chemotherapy.14-21 However, these studies have
been limited by retrospective designs and small, singlecenter patient cohorts. More important, these studies
defined their patient cohorts as those who received chemotherapy rather than whether chemotherapy was indicated. It is important to evaluate omission of treatment,
along with delays in administration. By defining our study
population by whether chemotherapy was indicated,
rather than received, we were able to show that immediate
breast reconstruction is not associated with any significant
omission in chemotherapy treatment.
The esthetic, psychological and financial benefits of
immediate breast reconstruction are clear. However, support for this approach among clinicians caring for women
with breast cancer could depend on their perceptions
about whether it compromises optimal chemotherapy
and, thus, survival.25 A recent survey of medical oncologists found that nearly 40% are concerned that immediate
postmastectomy breast reconstruction interferes with adjuvant oncologic therapy.26 Our results suggest that this
concern is unwarranted regarding chemotherapy. Recommendations regarding immediate breast reconstruction
may also be influenced by the likelihood that the patient

will also need adjuvant postmastectomy chest wall and
nodal radiation. Radiation improves survival in certain
subsets of women with positive nodes.27 Reconstruction
may affect the technical delivery of radiation,28 and radiation may adversely affect the cosmetic result of reconstruction.29 Although there is no uniform consensus, this
concern leads some oncologists to recommend delayed
reconstruction in women who are likely to receive radiation. The NCCN guidelines state that delayed reconstruction is preferred in this situation (a category 2B
recommendation). This may account for the documented

1798

lower use of immediate breast reconstruction in NCCN
centers in those women with more advanced cancer stage
and larger tumors.30
We found an interesting interaction between patient
age, type of surgical treatment, and delivery of chemotherapy. Our results are consistent with other studies showing
that older patients are less likely to receive chemotherapy
and also less likely to receive immediate breast reconstruction.31 However, our data suggest that older women who
undergo immediate breast reconstruction may be more
likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. These results did

not reach statistical significance in multivariable modeling, perhaps because of small sample size. But if
confirmed in larger studies, this would suggest that immediate breast reconstruction in those 60 years of age could
be a marker for a more aggressive treatment philosophy by
that patient, or overall more vigorous health as perceived
by their providers. Our results offer additional support of
the safety of breast reconstruction in well-selected older
women.13
We found that in addition to age, other clinical and
sociodemographic characteristics place patients at
increased risk for delayed chemotherapy. From a clinical
standpoint, postsurgical wounds and infections often are
the primary reasons delaying chemotherapy. There has
been well-established evidence linking patient obesity
with postoperative complications.13,32 Our data show a
significant association between obesity and high comorbidity score with delayed chemotherapy delivery. Quality
efforts should be aimed at improving patient selection for
elective breast reconstructive surgery. Surgeons should be
encouraged to delay breast reconstruction in these high
risk populations, in particular, those with a BMI >35 kg/
m2 and a comorbidity score 2.
Patient race was also a significant predictor of
delayed chemotherapy in our study. The reasons may be
multifactorial. Compared with Caucasian women, African Americans experience the greatest delay in breast cancer diagnosis,33 present with more aggressive disease,34
have limited knowledge regarding their reconstructive
options35 and are significantly less likely to receive reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy.7,8 We carefully
controlled for clinical characteristics in our analysis by
including not only stage, but also NCCN guideline, a
more granular measure of factors relevant to clinical decision making, and used a standardized measure of comorbidity. Therefore, nonclinical factors may also be playing
a role. A prior analysis of NCCN data found no effect of
race on reconstruction after mastectomy,36 suggesting
that the factors that influence time to chemotherapy may
differ from those that influence treatment choice.

tion on margins from the definitive pathology report, so
we cannot report on the frequency with which margins
were thought to be negative intraoperatively but were
reported as positive after definitive review. Although this
is a theoretical disadvantage of immediate reconstruction,
it would not be expected to increase the time to initiation
of chemotherapy. We also do not have information on
surgical complications, so we cannot comment on how
those factors affected treatment timing. Last, we have not
yet followed these patients long enough to assess the
impact of delays in chemotherapy on long-term survival
or recurrence.
Clinical Implications
Immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction does
not appear to lead to omission of adjuvant chemotherapy,
but it is associated with a very modest, but statistically significant, delay in initiating treatment. For the typical
patient, it is unlikely that this delay has any clinical significance. However, for patients who are at higher risk of
delay on the basis of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the additional delay associated with immediate
reconstruction should be considered. These higher risk
groups would include patients with lower stage disease,
morbid obesity, or serious comorbid conditions, as well as
African Americans. Future efforts should be aimed at
educating healthcare providers about these vulnerable
populations and implementing strategies to either delay
reconstruction in these groups or to facilitate the processes
of care through 1) improved communication between
physicians through multidisciplinary cancer clinics and
2) aggressive treatment of postoperative complications
to expedite recovery.
