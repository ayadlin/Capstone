VEGF Receptor Inhibitors Block the Ability of Metronomically
Dosed Cyclophosphamide to Activate Innate
Immunity–Induced Tumor Regression
Joshua C. Doloff and David J. Waxman

Abstract
In metronomic chemotherapy, frequent drug administration at lower than maximally tolerated doses can
improve activity while reducing the dose-limiting toxicity of conventional dosing schedules. Although the
antitumor activity produced by metronomic chemotherapy is attributed widely to antiangiogenesis, the
signiﬁcance of this mechanism remains somewhat unclear. In this study, we show that a 6-day repeating
metronomic schedule of cyclophosphamide administration activates a potent antitumor immune response
associated with brain tumor recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that
leads to marked tumor regression. Tumor regression was blocked in nonobese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID-g) mice, which are deﬁcient or dysfunctional in all these immune cell types.
Furthermore, regression was blunted by NK cell depletion in immunocompetent syngeneic mice or in
perforin-deﬁcient mice, which are compromised for NK, NKT, and T-cell cytolytic functions. Unexpectedly,
we found that VEGF receptor inhibitors blocked both innate immune cell recruitment and the associated
tumor regression response. Cyclophosphamide administered at a maximum tolerated dose activated a
transient, weak innate immune response, arguing that persistent drug-induced cytotoxic damage or
associated cytokine and chemokine responses are required for effective innate immunity–based tumor
regression. Together, our results reveal an innate immunity–based mechanism of tumor regression that can
be activated by a traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy administered on a metronomic schedule. These ﬁndings
suggest the need to carefully evaluate the clinical effects of combination chemotherapies that incorporate
antiangiogenesis drugs targeting VEGF receptor. Cancer Res; 72(5); 1103–15. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy has been a
mainstay in the cancer clinic for the past 50 years. However,
recent preclinical successes with metronomic chemotherapy,
where drug is administered at a regular, more frequent interval,
but at a lower dose than MTD chemotherapy, have been rapidly
translated into clinical trials, where improved antitumor
responses have been observed (1). Metronomic chemotherapy
eliminates the need for extended recovery periods between
treatment cycles and thus allows for persistent drug treatment
in a way that minimizes drug toxicity to the patient (2).
Metronomic chemotherapy schedules using cyclophosphamide and other chemotherapeutic drugs induce endothelial
cell death in addition to tumor cell death (2–4). Metronomic

chemotherapy also induces the antiangiogenic glycoprotein
thrombospondin-1 (TSP1; Thbs1; refs. 4, 5), suggesting that
antiangiogenesis is an important factor in the superior antitumor proﬁles of metronomic regimens (6, 7). However, this
proposed mechanism is not supported by the ﬁnding that bona
ﬁde antiangiogenic drugs often show only moderate antitumor
activity when used as single agents, despite their effectiveness
at inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Examples of this include
non–small cell lung cancer (8) and glioblastomas (9) in human
patients, 9L gliosarcoma xenografts treated in severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice (4), and metastatic melanomas in C57BL/6 mice (10). Thus, other mechanisms for the
improved antitumor effects of metronomic chemotherapy are
likely operative.
TSP1, in addition to its antiangiogenic activity, has other
actions, including stimulation of chemotaxis, cell proliferation,
and protease regulation in healing (11). Moreover, tumors that
stably express TSP1 have signiﬁcantly increased levels of
inﬁltrating antitumor M1 macrophages (12), suggesting a role
for the host immune system in the improved tumor responses
to metronomic drug treatments.
Presently, we show that a 6-day repeating metronomic
schedule of cyclophosphamide activates a potent and sustained antitumor innate immune response that is associated
with tumor regression and leads to ablation of large brain

tumor xenografts. In contrast, MTD cyclophosphamide treatment induces a weak immune response that dissipates during
the rest period between treatment cycles. We further show that
antitumor innate immunity, and not antiangiogenesis, is the
major mechanism for the marked tumor regression seen in
these models. Supporting this hypothesis, tumor regression
is blocked in natural killer (NK) cell–deﬁcient and macrophage and dendritic cell dysfunctional nonobese diabetic/
SCID (NOD/SCID-g) mice (13) and is blunted by NK cell
depletion in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model
and in mice deﬁcient in the lymphocyte effector molecule
perforin, where NK, NKT, and T-cell cytolytic function are
compromised (14).
In addition, we show that VEGF receptor–selective antiangiogenic drugs block antitumor immunity and prevent metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced tumor regression. VEGF
receptor signaling is important for dendritic cell–endothelial
cell cross-talk, transdifferentiation (15), tumor-associated
macrophage inﬁltration (16), and chemokine expression and
secretion in proinﬂammatory responses (17). Furthermore,
endothelial cells and immune cells have shared bone marrow–derived stem and progenitor cells regulated by VEGF
receptor (18), suggesting that compounds designed to kill
tumor blood vessels by inhibiting VEGF receptor signaling
may also elicit immunosuppressive responses.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Human U251 glioblastoma cells (National Cancer Institute),
rat 9L gliosarcoma cells (Neurosurgery Tissue Bank, University
of California, San Francisco), and mouse GL261 glioma cells
(DCTD, DTP Tumor Repository) were authenticated by and
obtained from the indicated sources. Cells were grown at 37 C
in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere. U251 and GL261 cells were
grown in RPMI-1640 and 9L cells in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Media, all of which contained 10% FBS, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
Mouse models and tumor xenografts
Five-week-old (24–26 g) male ICR/Fox Chase immunodeﬁcient SCID mice (Taconic Farms), 5-week-old male NOD. CgPrkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NOD-SCID-g, NSG) mice (The Jackson
Laboratory), and 5-week-old (22–24 g) male C57BL/6 (wildtype, immunocompetent; Taconic) and C57BL/6-Prf1 (perforin knockout; The Jackson Laboratory) mice were housed
and treated under approved protocols and federal guidelines.
Tumor cells (2  106 GL261 glioma cells, 4  106 9L gliosarcoma cells, or 6  106 U251 glioblastoma cells) were injected
s.c. on each posterior ﬂank in 0.2 mL serum-free RPMI using a
0.5-inch 29-gauge needle and a 1-mL insulin syringe. 9L and
U251 tumor xenografts were grown s.c. on the ﬂanks of SCID or
NSG mice, and GL261 tumors were inoculated into the ﬂanks of
C57BL/6 (wild-type or Prf1) mice. Tumor areas (length 
width) were measured twice weekly using Vernier calipers
(VWR, Cat# 62379-531), and tumor volumes were calculated
on the basis of the formula, Vol ¼ (p/6)  (L  W)3/2. Tumors
were monitored and treatment groups were normalized (each

tumor volume set to 100%) once average tumor volumes
reached 500 mm3. Mice were treated with cyclophosphamide given on an intermittent metronomic schedule (140 mg
cyclophosphamide/kg body weight, repeated every 6 days)
or on an MTD schedule (150 mg cyclophosphamide/kg
body weight on each of 2 consecutive days, followed by a
19-day rest period) as indicated on each ﬁgure using vertical
arrows. Axitinib and AG-028262 were administered daily at
25 mg/kg body weight/d intraperitoneally and cediranib at
5 mg/kg body weight/d intraperitoneally for up to 24 days, as
indicated in each study. NK cell–depleting monoclonal
antibody anti-asialo-GM1 (cat# 986–10001, Wako Chemicals
USA) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 50 mL
(diluted 1:3 in sterile 1 PBS to ﬁnal volume of 150 mL for
each mouse on the day of injection) and delivered once every
6 days starting 3 days prior to the ﬁrst metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment (i.e., asialo-GM1 antibody was given
3 days prior to each cyclophosphamide injection). On combination therapy days, cyclophosphamide was administered
4 hours prior to treatment with a VEGF receptor inhibitor to
minimize the potential for drug interactions. Tumor sizes
and mouse body weights were measured at least twice a
week. Tumor growth rates prior to drug treatment were
similar among all normalized groups.
Quantitative PCR and statistical analysis
RNA isolation, quantitative PCR (qPCR) primer design,
and qPCR analyses were done as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. qPCR data are expressed as
mean values  SE for n ¼ 5 to 6 individual tumors from 3
mice per time point per treatment group unless indicated
otherwise. Statistically signiﬁcant differences between
mean values of different treatment groups were determined
by 2-tailed Student t test ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.001;  ,
P < 0.0001).
Other methods
Sources of reagents and drugs, ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis, and immunohistochemical methods
are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
Metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced regression of
brain tumor xenografts does not involve
antiangiogenesis
Although antiangiogenesis is considered a key mechanistic
feature of metronomic chemotherapy, metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment of SCID mice bearing U251 glioblastoma
xenografts induces tumor regression that is sustained and
complete (Fig. 1A) in the absence of antiangiogenesis
(Fig. 1B). In contrast, the VEGF receptor–selective inhibitor
axitinib (19) is strongly antiangiogenic (Fig. 1B) yet primarily
shows a growth static response, followed by rapid tumor
regrowth upon discontinuation of treatment (Fig. 1A). Axitinib
initially increased antitumor activity when combined with
metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment but ultimately
blocked the tumor regression seen with metronomic therapy

Metronomic cyclophosphamide activates antitumor

To better understand why metronomic cyclophosphamide fully regresses U251 tumors, even in the absence of
antiangiogenesis, we investigated other potential mechanisms and found that several macrophage-associated host
factors are increased in the metronomic cyclophosphamide–

Supplementary Fig. S2A), macrophage cytolytic effectors
lysozyme 1 and 2 (Supplementary Fig. S2B), and the death
receptor Fas (Fig. 2B), which activates macrophages and
increases their tumor cytotoxicity (21).
The above ﬁndings suggested that metronomic cyclophosphamide activates an innate immune response in the
regressing tumors. To investigate this possibility, we considered NK cells, given the role of Fas in mediating interactions between NK cells and cells marked for destruction
(22). In metronomic cyclophosphamide–treated tumors, we
observed large increases in the host NK cell marker NK1.1
and in the NK cell–associated cytotoxic granzymes A, B, and
C and perforin (Fig. 2A and C; Supplementary Figs. S2C and
S3A–S3C), which are essential for cytotoxic lymphocyte–

treated tumors, including TSP1 (Fig. 1C). While TSP1 has
antiangiogenic activity (5), it has also been linked to tumor
inﬁltration by antitumor M1 macrophages (12). Metronomic cyclophosphamide also increased host (mouse cell)
expression of pigment epithelium–derived factor (PEDF;
Serpinf1; Fig. 1D), an antiangiogenic factor that also stimulates M1 macrophage recruitment to tumors (20). These
responses were seen in both rat 9L and human U251 tumors
grown in SCID mice, where TSP1 and PEDF levels were
strongly correlated (r ¼ 0.89) in large sets of untreated and
drug-treated tumors isolated various times after initiation
of metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). Metronomic cyclophosphamide also induced
the host macrophage markers CD68 and F4/80 (Fig. 2A;

of NK1.1þ cells into the metronomic cyclophosphamide–
treated tumors (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S3D). Dendritic
cells were also recruited to the tumors, as shown by the
activation of host dendritic cell markers important for cell–
target interactions, and antigen presentation to the adaptive
immune system (Fig. 2E). CD74, implicated in the regulation
of dendritic cell migration (23), was also increased (Fig. 2A;
Supplementary Figs. S2D and S3A and S3B). Because NK1.1
and dendritic cell markers are both increased in the cyclophosphamide-treated tumors, other NK1.1þ cells, such as
IFN-producing killer dendritic cells (24), could also be
involved. Host cytokine and chemokine immune attractants,

U251 and 9L tumors, axitinib blocked tumor inﬁltration of NK
cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Fig. 2; Supplementary
Figs. S2 and S3A–S3C). Axitinib also blocked the formation of
chemokine and cytokine gradients that may mobilize these

suppressed these immune factors to basal or below basal levels.
Axitinib also suppressed the induction by metronomic cyclophosphamide of human tumor cell–expressed MICB (Fig. 3C),
which is an activating ligand for the receptor NKG2D found on
NK and other immune cells (26). This ﬁnding suggests that
axitinib might further inhibit metronomic cyclophosphamide–
induced tumor cell–targeted antitumor immunity by blocking
the expression and subsequent presentation of activation
signals by cyclophosphamide-damaged tumor cells. Finally,
axitinib shifted the balance of tumor-associated macrophages from antitumor M1 [marked by inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS)] to protumor M2 macrophages (marked by
arginase-1; Fig. 3D). Thus, the inhibitory effects of axitinib on
metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced tumor regression
likely result from interference with the innate immune
response at multiple levels.
Next, we used 2 other antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cediranib (AZD2171; ref. 27) and AG-028262 (28), to
investigate the importance of VEGF receptor signaling for
metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced antitumor immunity. These 2 chemicals exhibit selectivity for VEGF receptor
inhibition comparable with or greater than that of axitinib
(27, 28). In U251 tumors grown in SCID mice, cediranib and

AG-028262 strongly inhibited tumor angiogenesis, as expected
(Fig. 4A); however, they also blocked metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced NK cell activity (Fig. 4B) and the recruitment of all 3 classes of innate immune cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, by the sixth day of treatment, both drugs blocked
U251 regression induced by metronomic cyclophosphamide,
resulting in tumor growth stasis that continued until the study
was terminated on treatment day 18, whereas over that same
time period, tumors treated with metronomic cyclophosphamide alone regressed a further 50% in volume. Thus, interference with metronomic chemotherapy–induced antitumor
immunity and tumor regression are general responses to VEGF
receptor inhibitors.
Metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced tumor
regression requires innate immune cells
To test whether the tumor-inﬁltrating innate immune cells
contribute functionally to tumor regression, we investigated
the effects of metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment on
9L gliosarcomas grown in NOD-SCID-IL2Rg-null (NSG) mice,
which, unlike SCID mice, are NK cell deﬁcient and have
dysfunctional macrophages and dendritic cells due to loss of
the important immunostimulatory IL-2Rg receptor (13). In

NSG mice, metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced 9L tumor
growth delay led to growth stasis after several treatment cycles
but no regression (Fig. 5A). While macrophages, dendritic cells,
and markers for other innate immune cell types such as
neutrophils and platelets are present in the tumors and are
increased by metronomic cyclophosphamide (Fig. 5B and C),
NK cells (NKp46) and their cytotoxic effectors, granzyme B and
perforin, were undetectable (Fig. 5C). Thus, the large differential antitumor response between NSG mice (tumor growth
stasis) and SCID mice (full tumor regression; Fig. 5A) can be
attributed to the diminished innate immune response to
metronomic cyclophosphamide in NSG mice (Fig. 5C, left:
NSG vs. SCID). NK cell factors (NKp46, NK1.1, GzmB, and Prf1)

continued metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment was also
apparent (Fig. 5C, right). The tumor growth stasis seen in NSG
mice likely reﬂects residual antitumor immune cell responses
(Fig. 5B and C) and the intrinsic cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide toward tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells. The
delayed increase in the NK cell markers NKp46 and perforin in
cyclophosphamide-treated SCID mouse 9L tumors (Fig. 5C) is
consistent with the delayed onset of tumor regression (Fig. 5A),
further implicating NK cell function in this response to metronomic cyclophosphamide. Finally, a strong increase in TSP1
expression was seen in the metronomic cyclophosphamide–

mice, respectively, and on day 66 in the CPA + GM1 group. Tumors were inoculated 28 days prior to the ﬁrst cyclophosphamide treatment (day 0). B, qPCR

recruitment into metronomic cyclophosphamide–treated tumors. The partial regression seen with anti-asialo-GM1 in A may result from the unimpeded tumor
recruitment of dendritic cells and macrophages, seen in C (bottom). qPCR data were normalized to untreated (UT), whose relative RNA level was set to 1.

Metronomic Cyclophosphamide Activates Innate Immunity, Tumor Regression

treated NSG mouse 9L tumors (Fig. 5B), despite the lack of
tumor regression. Thus, TSP1 and its antiangiogenic activity
are not sufﬁcient to drive tumor regression, which may help
explain why TSP1 production is not a reliable marker for
clinical response to metronomic chemotherapy (29).
Metronomic cyclophosphamide–activated antitumor
immunity and tumor regression in an
immunocompetent, syngeneic mouse model
To ascertain whether the strong innate immune responses
to metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment are limited to
animals with deﬁciencies in T- and B-adaptive immune cells,
the impact of metronomic cyclophosphamide was investigated
in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice bearing the syngeneic
glioma GL261. These studies additionally enabled us to determine whether metronomic cyclophosphamide activates a
T- or B-cell adaptive immune response and whether regulatory suppressor T cells (Treg) are also recruited to the tumors
and might interfere with antitumor immunity (30). Strikingly,
metronomic cyclophosphamide fully regressed all GL261
tumors (Supplementary Table S1), with no tumor regrowth
seen at day 140, that is, 80 days after halting metronomic
cyclophosphamide (Fig. 6A). Large increases in tumor-associated NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages occurred at the
onset of tumor regression and continued for at least 4 metronomic cyclophosphamide cycles (Fig. 6B, left). We also
observed delayed recruitment of CD4þ helper T cells and CD8þ
cytotoxic T-effector cells to the regressing tumors, but no
increase in Tregs (marked by FoxP3; Fig. 6B, right). The latter
ﬁnding is consistent with the reported selectivity of metronomic cyclophosphamide for killing Tregs but not cytotoxic
antitumor T-effector cells (30, 31).
Causal role for innate immune cells in tumor regression
The functional consequence of NK cell recruitment was
probed by NK cell depletion using anti-asialo-GM1 antibody
(32), which resulted in delayed and substantially incomplete
GL261 tumor regression (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Table S1).
Tumor cell recruitment of NK cells was fully blocked by asialoGM1 antibody over multiple cyclophosphamide treatment
cycles, and splenic NK cell levels were also suppressed (Fig.
6C, top). Metronomic cyclophosphamide recruitment of dendritic cells and macrophages was unaffected by NK cell depletion (Fig. 6C, bottom) and may contribute to the partial tumor
regression observed. Importantly, NK cell recruitment and
complete tumor regression were both restored following termination of asialo-GM1 antibody treatment on day 51 (Fig. 6A).
Thus, while other immune cells likely contribute to metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced tumor regression, NK cells
are required both for the early onset and for the completeness
of tumor regression. Metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced
GL261 regression was also delayed and even less complete in
C57BL/6 mice deﬁcient in perforin (Fig. 6A; Supplementary
Table S1). Perforin deﬁciency severely decreases not only NK
cell but also NKT cell and cytotoxic T-cell cytolytic activity (14).
The further diminished antitumor response in the perforinknockout mice suggests that adaptive immune lymphocytes
contribute to tumor regression. Markers for host adaptive

www.aacrjournals.org

immune CD8þ T lymphocytes and innate immune NK cells,
macrophages, and dendritic cells were all strongly induced in
GL261 tumors by metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment of
the perforin-knockout mice (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Thus,
despite intact immune cell mobilization, the impairment of
lymphocyte cytolytic function in the absence of perforin is
sufﬁcient to seriously impair metronomic cyclophosphamide–
induced tumor regression. Thus, the host immune system is
essential for metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced tumor
regression.
MTD cyclophosphamide induces a weak, transient
innate immune response
U251 tumors grown in SCID mice initially responded to
MTD cyclophosphamide treatment; however, the response was
short-lived and was followed by resumption of rapid growth
during the drug-free recovery period between treatment cycles
(Fig. 7A). An initial, modest innate immune response to MTD
cyclophosphamide dissipated during the recovery period,
whereas the response to metronomic cyclophosphamide was
sustained and became maximal by day 18, as judged by the
increased expression of the cytotoxic effector granzyme B (Fig.
7B, top) and other immune cell markers (Fig. 7C). MTD
cyclophosphamide treatment did increase overall granzyme
B exposure by approximately 40%; however, the increase
following metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment was more
than 10-fold higher (Fig. 7B, bottom).

Discussion
The present ﬁndings identify innate immune cell recruitment, and not TSP1-mediated antiangiogenesis, as a major,
functionally important mechanism for the dramatic regression
of brain tumor xenografts treated with cyclophosphamide on a
6-day repeating, metronomic schedule. This immune response
involves a strong NK cell component that contributes functionally to tumor regression. These ﬁndings are based on
studies in 3 brain tumor models, including a syngeneic, fully
immunocompetent mouse model, indicating that it is not due
to immune dysregulation as a result of the lack of an adaptive
immune system. In contrast, MTD cyclophosphamide did not
induce immune recruitment leading to tumor regression,
indicating that the scheduling of chemotherapy is a critical
requirement for this innate immune response. Finally, several
VEGF receptor–selective antiangiogenesis drugs were shown
to block innate immune recruitment, implicating VEGF receptors in the mechanism whereby metronomic cyclophosphamide activates innate immunity. The latter ﬁnding is particularly important given the widespread efforts to develop
effective ways to combine VEGF receptor inhibitors with
traditional cytotoxic anticancer drugs (6).
Metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced tumor inﬁltration by macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells was
established using both structural and functional markers
for each immune cell type. In the case of NK cells, strong
induction of several functional markers was observed, notably NKp46, perforin, and granzymes A, B, and C. Moreover,
functionality was de facto established by GM1 antibody

depletion, which seriously compromised metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced tumor ablation, with tumor regression resuming shortly after antibody depletion was terminated. Functional markers for the tumor-recruited macrophages included the macrophage cytolytic effectors lysozyme 1 and 2, which showed large increases in the treated
tumors, and in the case of dendritic cells, DC-SIGN (CD209),
which is important for dendritic cell function and antigen
presentation. The increases in DC-SIGN exceeded those of
the dendritic cell structural markers CD207 (Langerin) and
CD74, suggesting an increase in dendritic cell activity in
addition to recruitment in response to metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment. Markers for other innate immune
cells, such as platelets and neutrophils, were also increased;
however, further studies will be required to fully characterize

their involvement in metronomic cyclophosphamide–activated antitumor immunity and tumor regression.
Conceivably, other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs may
also induce a sustained antitumor innate immune response
when given on a metronomic schedule (1). Metronomic chemotherapies may thus complement strategies to counter
immune evasion by tumor cells, such as ex vivo immune cell
augmentation, host immune ablation, and adoptive immunotherapy (33). In other studies, low-dose chemotherapy can
modulate various antitumor immune responses. Examples
include the ability of vinblastine to induce dendritic cell
maturation (34) and that of cyclophosphamide to suppress
Tregs (30, 31). Several daily, low-dose metronomic regimens
have been shown to enhance antitumor immunity by selectively killing Treg suppressor cells and thereby restoring

Metronomic Cyclophosphamide Activates Innate Immunity, Tumor Regression

antitumor lymphocyte effector function; however, an increase
in tumor NK cells was not established (31, 35, 36). In contrast,
recruitment of immune cell inﬁltrates to the tumor microenvironment was shown here and is likely to be critical to the
major tumor regression responses that we observed. Moreover, our ﬁnding that large increases in tumor-associated NK
cells occur not only in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice
but also in immunodeﬁcient SCID mice, which are devoid of
Tregs, indicates that the NK cell response described here is
both novel and mechanistically distinct from the relief of
immunosuppression by Tregs reported previously using daily
low-dose metronomic schedules (31, 35, 36).
Cyclophosphamide given on a 6-day metronomic schedule
may also potentiate antitumor adaptive immunity, as suggested by the increase in CD8þ T cells through downregulation
of iNOS (37). Although iNOS regulation was not explored in
the present study, we did observe a temporal delay in the
recruitment of adaptive immune cytotoxic CD8þ T cells to the
regressing GL261 tumors. Perforin knockout, which greatly
impairs both innate and adaptive lymphocyte effector function
(14), had a greater impact on tumor regression than antibody
depletion of NK cells alone (Fig. 6A), suggesting a role for
adaptive CD8þ T cells in the antitumor response to metronomic cyclophosphamide.
The tumor regression responses reported here were robust
and were validated in 3 brain tumor xenograft models. Future
studies will be required to extend these ﬁndings to other tumor
models, including orthotopic brain tumor models. Importantly, many orthotopic sites have endogenous innate immune cell
populations, including the liver, which contains Kupffer and
NK cells (38), and the brain, where microglia and NK cells can
inﬁltrate tumors (39). Although the blood–brain barrier often
impedes chemotherapeutic drug access to brain tumors, 4hydroxy-CPA, the active metabolite of cyclophosphamide, is
membrane permeable and can cross the blood–brain barrier
(40). Furthermore, brain tumors may be leaky, disrupting
surrounding extracellular matrix and the blood–brain barrier
itself (41).
Innate immune cell recruitment is shown to be a target for
the inhibitory effects of several VEGF receptor–selective inhibitors on metronomic cyclophosphamide–induced tumor
regression. This ﬁnding has important implications for treatments combining chemotherapy, in particular metronomic
chemotherapy, with VEGF receptor inhibitory antiangiogenic
drugs. While VEGF receptor signaling inhibitors can improve
responses to some metronomic therapies (e.g., see ref. 29),
those studies typically use daily low-dose metronomic drug
treatment, which may be less effective at eliciting an antitumor
immune response than the 6-day repeating metronomic cyclophosphamide schedule used here (J.C. Doloff and D.J. Waxman;
unpublished data). Furthermore, the suppression of innate
immune cell recruitment by VEGF receptor inhibitors suggests
that these drugs decrease immune surveillance, which could
help explain the increases in metastatic incidence and progression recently linked to this class of antiangiogenic agents
(42). Supporting this hypothesis, metastatic inﬁltration of
tumor cells in NOD/SCID mice is increased by NK cell–depleting antibody, and metastasis is even more severe when tumor

cells are grown in additionally immunocompromised NSG
mice (43). Furthermore, numerous GL261 tumors implanted
in perforin knockout C57BL/6 mice were not restricted to the
subcutaneous space and inﬁltrated into the intraperitoneal
activity.
VEGF receptors, which are targeted by the 3 antiangiogenic
drugs used here, have been implicated in dendritic cell differentiation and are important for dendritic cell–endothelial cell
cross-talk, transdifferentiation, and tumor-associated macrophage inﬁltration (44). Endothelial cell VEGF signaling is also
important for chemokine expression and secretion in proinﬂammatory responses (17), suggesting an additional mechanism whereby the inhibition of VEGF signaling could block
innate immune cell recruitment. Indeed, in our models, the
VEGF receptor inhibitor axitinib blocked induction of host
(mouse) chemokines IL-12b and CXCL14 by metronomic
cyclophosphamide treatment. IL-12 is expressed and secreted
by activated dendritic cells, neutrophils, and macrophages
and can activate antitumor NK cells and T cells (45), whereas
CXCL14 stimulates activated NK cell migration (46). We
observed that splenic NK cell reservoirs were decreased over
time in metronomic cyclophosphamide–treated SCID mice,
perhaps reﬂecting net immune cell migration out from the
spleen and into the treated tumors. A corresponding decrease
in splenic NK cell factors was not seen in immunocompetent
C57BL/6 mice, which had higher basal levels of NK cells, both
in spleen and in untreated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
The suppression of the innate immune response by VEGF
receptor inhibitors reported here is likely due to the inhibition
of VEGF signaling, rather than a secondary response to the
associated loss of blood vessels required for immune cell
trafﬁcking into the tumor compartment, insofar as antiangiogenic agents that decrease tumor vascularity without inhibiting VEGF signaling do not block metronomic cyclophosphamide–stimulated antitumor innate immunity (J.C. Doloff and
D.J. Waxman; unpublished data). Thus, inhibition of antitumor
innate immunity is not a characteristic of antiangiogenesis per
se. Antiangiogenic agents that target tumor endothelial cells
without inhibition of VEGF receptor include the tubulin-targeting cytotoxic agent Oxi4053 and the cell-cycle inhibitor
TPN-470, both of which can enhance antitumor activity when
combined with metronomic chemotherapy (3, 47). In addition,
TPN-470 inhibits both tumor metastases and primary tumor
growth (48).
The empirical observation that a 6-day metronomic cyclophosphamide schedule is optimal with regard to antitumor
activity (3) could reﬂect the life span of host immune cells
such as platelets, which are ﬁrst-line immune responders
to tissue inﬂammation and damage and have a life span of
5 to 10 days (49). While other metronomic chemotherapy
schedules, including daily, low-dose regimens, show antitumor activity (1), we suggest that an intermittent metronomic
schedule, such as the every-6-day bolus cyclophosphamide
regimen used here, may be optimal with respect to activation of
innate immunity: sufﬁciently frequent to repeatedly induce
tumor cytotoxicity and inﬂammation and activate cytokine/
chemokine attractants leading to an innate immune response,
whereas at the same time sufﬁciently infrequent to minimize

the killing of immune cells recruited to the tumor. While the
metronomic dose of cyclophosphamide used here is higher
than metronomic dosages used in patients with cancer,
where daily metronomic dosing is most often used (1), our
metronomic schedule (140 mg/kg cyclophosphamide, every 6
days) is, in fact, slightly lower in total drug exposure than that of
the low-dose, daily metronomic cyclophosphamide regimen
used in mouse models by others (25 mg/kg, daily, which
corresponds to a total dose of 150 mg/kg every 6 days) to
model metronomic dosing in the clinic (50). The exact dosing
and metronomic timing requirements for an effective antitumor immune response can be expected to vary with the
chemotherapeutic drug and are likely to beneﬁt from efforts
at optimization.
The precise nature of the cytotoxic damage, stress response,
and cytokine and chemokine signals required for metronomic
cyclophosphamide to elicit an antitumor immune response are
unknown. The ability of metronomic cyclophosphamide to
induce such a response is likely to vary between tumors, insofar
as the same metronomic cyclophosphamide dose and schedule
used in the present study did not elicit regression (51) or
an innate immune response (J.C. Doloff and D.J. Waxman;
unpublished data) in the case of PC-3 prostate tumor xenografts. Given the absence of immune cell involvement in the
PC-3 model, it is not surprising that the combination of
metronomic cyclophosphamide with axitinib was more effective, rather than less effective against PC-3 tumors than
metronomic cyclophosphamide alone (51). Conceivably, an
innate immune response leading to tumor regression may be
achieved with PC-3 and other tumors by appropriate choice of
drug, dose, and metronomic schedule. Indeed, tumors derived
from immortalized ﬁbroblasts are regressed via an apoptosisindependent mechanism involving macrophages when cyclo-

phosphamide is given at 170 mg/kg on a 5-day repeating
schedule (52), and regression of mammary MX-1, ovarian
SK-OV-3, and neuroblastoma SK-NAS tumor xenografts is
achieved when paclitaxel is given on various metronomic
schedules (53). Further studies to investigate the involvement
of NK and other immune cells in these tumor regression
responses would be of interest.
Chemotherapeutic drugs elicit a variety of distinct types of
DNA damage and activate different cellular stress responses,
some of which are known to activate NK cells (54), which could
be one mechanism whereby metronomic cyclophosphamide
activates an innate immune response. In U251 tumors grown in
SCID mice, we found that metronomic cyclophosphamide
induced tumor cell expression of MICB, a ligand for the innate
immune cell activating receptor NKG2D. Axitinib blocked this
increase in MICB expression, further implicating tumor cell–
speciﬁc expression of MICB in targeting of NK and other
immune cells to the drug-treated tumors.
