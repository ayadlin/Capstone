ABSTRACT
The use of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has led to excellent clinical
responses in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However
these inhibitors have been less effective as single agents in the terminal blast phase
(BP). We show that pyrvinium, a FDA-approved anthelminthic drug, selectively targets
BP-CML CD34+ progenitor cells. Pyrvinium is effective in inducing apoptosis, inhibiting
colony formation and self-renewal capacity of CD34+ cells from TKI-resistant BP-CML
patients, while cord blood CD34+ are largely unaffected. The effects of pyrvinium are
further enhanced upon combination with dasatinib, a second generation BCR-ABL1
TKI. In a CML xenograft model pyrvinium significantly inhibits tumor growth as a
single agent, with complete inhibition in combination with dasatinib. While pyrvinium
has been shown to inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway via activation of
casein kinase 1α , we find its activity in CML is not dependent on this pathway.
Instead, we show that pyrvinium localizes to mitochondria and induces apoptosis by
inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Our study suggests that pyrvinium is a useful
addition to the treatment armamentarium for BP-CML and that targeting mitochondrial
respiration may be a potential therapeutic strategy in aggressive leukemia.

INTRODUCTION

protein phosphatase 2A or inhibition of leukemia stem
cell self-renewal by targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
through inhibition of MAP kinase interacting serine/
threonine kinase (MNK)-eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 4E (eIF4E) axis [3, 4].
Targeting cancer metabolism, such as oxidative
phosphorylation, has recently become an attractive
therapeutic strategy in human leukemia [5]. In contrast to
normal progenitor cells, acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
progenitor cells have increased mitochondrial biogenesis
and are more dependent on mitochondrial respiration
rather than glycolysis for energy production to maintain
survival [6, 7]. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation or
mitochondrial translation selectively kills AML progenitor

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant
hematopoietic stem cell disorder caused by the oncogenic
BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Although the introduction of
BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has improved
clinical responses and outcomes significantly, blast phase
(BP) disease remains a major therapeutic challenge
[1]. The molecular mechanisms leading to BP disease
progression are complex and involve inhibition of tumor
suppressors, genomic instability and block of myeloid
differentiation [2]. Novel strategies are currently being
investigated in early phase clinical trials or preclinical
studies. These include activation of the tumor suppressor,

cells but not normal bone marrow or peripheral blood
progenitor cells, suggesting that the unique dependence of
leukemia primary cells on oxidative phosphorylation can
be exploited therapeutically [6, 7].
Pyrvinium is a FDA-approved anthelminthic drug
used for the treatment of pinworm infections [8]. Recent
studies have shown that pyrvinium selectively inhibits
the growth of tumor cells of diverse tissue origins,
including pancreas, colon, breast, brain, myeloma and
erythroleukemia [9-17]. It has also been shown that
pyrvinium exhibits increased cytotoxicity in tumor cells
under hypoglycemic conditions and enhances the effects of
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in tumor xenografts
[11, 13, 18]. The mechanism of action of pyrvinium
appears to vary in different tumor types. Pyrvinium has
been reported to inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells
through allosteric activation of casein kinase 1α (CK1α)
and destabilization of β-catenin [15]. Pyrvinium also
inhibits medulloblastoma through attenuating hedgehog
signalling in a CK1α dependent manner [16]. However,
pyrvinium has also been shown to inhibit the proliferation
of myeloma and erythroleukemia cells by suppressing
the mitochondrial respiratory complex I [12]. Other
mechanisms that have been implicated include targeting
unfolded protein response and autophagy [11, 13].
In this study, we investigated the effect of pyrvinium
and its combination with the BCR-ABL1 TKI, dasatinib
in BP-CML. We found that pyrvinium selectively induces
apoptosis, inhibits colony formation and self-renewal
of CD34+ progenitor cells from TKI-resistant BP-CML
patients. We also show that pyrvinium enhances the effect
of dasatinib in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate
that the anti-tumor effects of pyrvinium in BP-CML are
independent of CK1α inhibition and are largely attributed
to its inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.

Pyrvinium is active against CML cell lines and
synergistic in combination with dasatinib in vitro
and in vivo
We investigated the effects of pyrvinium alone and
in combination with dasatinib on the proliferation and
apoptosis in human CML cell lines (K562, LAMA84
and KU812). Exposure to pyrvinium alone inhibited
proliferation of the CML cells in a dose-dependent manner,
with IC50 of 50-200 nM (Figure 1a). Pyrvinium also
induced apoptosis in these cells, particularly LAMA84
and KU812, as assessed by flow cytometry for Annexin
V staining (Figure 1b). To determine the combination
effects of pyrvinium and dasatinib, we designed
combination studies based on the methods proposed by
Chou and Talalay [19] Combination indices (CI) at 50%,
75% and 90% growth inhibition are summarised in Table
1. Synergy, as defined by a CI < 1 between pyrvinium
and dasatinib, was observed at all effect levels. The
combination of pyrvinium and dasatinib was also superior
in inducing apoptosis in the CML cell lines (Figure 1c).
We next evaluated the effects of pyrvinium in vivo
and tested whether combination with dasatinib resulted
in greater efficacy than with single drug. Using an
established CML xenograft mouse model [20], we injected
K562 cells subcutaneously into the flank of SCID mice.
Once tumors reached approximately 200mm3, the mice
were treated with intraperitoneal pyrvinium 0.5 mg/kg
daily, oral dasatinib 1 mg/kg daily or a combination of
both. The mice in all 3 groups tolerated the treatment well,
as assessed by body weight (Supplemental Figure S1).
Pyrvinium delayed tumor growth beginning at 4 days of
the initial treatment and its inhibitory effect was observed
throughout the duration of treatment (Figure 1d). Of note,
the inhibitory effect of pyrvinium 0.5 mg/kg was similar

to dasatinib 1 mg/kg. When both drugs were combined,
tumor growth was completely inhibited.

dasatinib further enhanced apoptosis compared to single
agent therapy. Importantly, we did not observe enhanced
apoptosis in drug combination-treated cord blood CD34+
cells (Figure 2a and Supplemental Table 2), indicating
that pyrvinium and its combination with dasatinib exhibit
selective toxicity against BP-CML vs. cord blood CD34+
progenitor cells. In addition, the combination of pyrvinium
and other TKIs, such as imatinib and nilotinib, also
induced significantly more apoptosis of BP-CML CD34
cells than single drug alone (Supplemental Figure S2).
The propensity to self-renew, proliferate and
differentiate are hallmark features of stem/progenitor
cells [21]. To test whether pyrvinium affects proliferation
and self-renewal of BP-CML CD34+ cells, we performed
colony-forming and serial replating assays. We found
that pyrvinium decreased colony formation and selfrenewal capacity of BP-CML CD34+ cells in a dosedependent manner (Figures 2b-2c). We noted that cord
blood CD34+ cells were less sensitive to increasing doses

Pyrvinium selectively targets BP-CML CD34+
progenitor cells and acts synergistically with
dasatinib
An important feature of targeted therapy is the
ability to be selective in retaining activity against leukemia
cells while sparing normal cells. Compared to chronic
phase CML, TKI inhibitors are less effective as single
agents in BP-CML cells. We therefore examined the effects
of pyrvinium, dasatinib or the combination on CD34+
cells isolated from BP-CML patients or from cord blood
(patient clinical information is in Supplemental Table
1). Consistent with our CML cell line results, pyrvinium
induced dose-dependent apoptosis in CD34+ cells in
BP-CML patients. The combination of pyrvinium and

experiments. d. Combination of pyrvinium and dasatinib arrests growth of CML xenografts. SCID mice bearing K562 tumor xenografts

0.5 mg/kg pyrvinium (n = 10) by intraperitoneal injection or both drugs (n = 10). *p < 0.01, compared to untreated controls or single arm

Pyrvinium acts on CML in a CK1α-independent
manner

of pyrvinium exposure. In addition, colony formation and
self-renewal of BP-CML but not cord blood CD34+ cells
were completely abolished when they were treated with
a combination of dasatinib and pyrvinium (Figures 2b-2c
and Supplemental Tables 3-4). Hence, pyrvinium alone
and its combination with dasatinib preferentially target
BP-CML compared to cord blood CD34+ progenitors by
inhibiting their proliferation and self-renewal capacity.

The direct anti-cancer molecular targets of
pyrvinium have rarely been elucidated [12, 13, 15]. Thorne
et al. demonstrated that the anti-colon cancer effects of
pyrvinium were due to its allosteric activation of CK1α
and subsequent suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signalling
[15]. Given that Wnt/β-catenin signalling has been shown
to be activated in BP-CML [22], we tested whether CK1α
or destabilization of β-catenin is required for the anti-CML
effects of pyrvinium.
We first depleted CK1α in K562 cells with two

independent CK1α siRNA but observed that these
cells remained sensitive to pyrvinium (Figure 3a and
Supplemental Figure S3a). Similarly, overexpression of
wild-type or stabilized β-catenin (S45A) in K562 cells
failed to rescue the growth inhibitory effects of pyrvinium
(Figure 3b and Supplemental Figure S3b). We found that
depletion of CK1α in two other AML cell lines (HEL and
MOLM) also failed to reverse the growth inhibitory effects
of pyrvinium (Figures 3c-3d and Supplemental Figure
S3c). The data indicates that pyrvinium acts on leukemia
cells in a CK1α and β-catenin-independent manner. Since
pyrvinium inhibits proliferation of HCT-116 through
activating CK1α [15], we next determined whether the
target of pyrvinium is cell-type specific Consistent with
the findings of Throne et al., pyrvinium-induced growth
inhibition of HCT-116 colon cancer and SUM159 breast
cancer cells was abolished by depletion of CK1α (Figures

3e-3f and Supplemental Figure S3c), suggesting that CK1α
is required for the mechanism of action of pyrvinium in
breast and colon cancer. Taken together, our data suggest
that pyrvinium acts in a cancer cell-type specific manner
and additional important molecular targets of pyrvinium
are present in CML.

Pyrvinium preferentially localizes in mitochondria
of CML cells, rapidly inhibits mitochondrial
respiratory capacity and decreases ATP levels
Given that pyrvinium inhibits proliferation
of myeloma/erythroleukemia cells by suppressing
mitochondrial respiration [12], we next investigated
whether the target of pyrvinium in CML cells exists in the
mitochondria. Pyrvinium is a quinolone-derived cyanine
dye that fluoresces red. We assessed its subcellular location

in CML cells via fluorescent confocal microscopy and the
mitochondria marker, Mitotracker Green. We found that
pyrvinium stains K562, LAMA84 and KU812 cells within
5 minutes (Figure 4a and Supplemental Figure S4a).
Importantly, pyrvinium co-localizes with Mito-tracker
Green, suggesting that the target of pyrvinium resides in
the mitochondria of CML cells.
Next, we tested whether pyrvinium affects
physiologic functions of the mitochondria of CML
cells. We found that CML cells that were treated with
pyrvinium had a significantly reduced baseline oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) and were non-responsive to
uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
via FCCP (Figures 4b-4d; Supplemental Figures S4b-S4g).
Consistent with the mitochondrial localization data, the
pyrvinium-induced decrease in oxidative phosphorylation
(measured by OCR) was achieved within 5 minutes of

drug exposure (Figure 4e; Supplemental Figure S5).
Furthermore, a significant decline in cellular ATP levels
was observed in pyrvinium-treated CML cells as compared
to their vehicle-treated counterparts (Figure 4f). Taken
together these data show that pyrvinium significantly and
directly inhibits basal and spare respiratory capacity of
CML cells to induce an acute energy crisis.

Mitochondrial respiratory chain-deficient CML ρ0
cells are insensitive to pyrvinium.
To investigate whether pyrvinium targets a
mitochondrial genome-encoded component of oxidative
phosphorylation in CML, we generated CML ρ0 cells that
lack mitochondrial DNA and are incapable of performing
mitochondrial respiration [23]. We confirmed that gene
expression from mitochondrial DNA (MT-ND6 and MT-

CO2), but not nuclear DNA (SDHA), was significantly
lower in the ρ0 cells derived from LAMA84 and KU812,
as compared to their parental lines (Supplemental Figure
S6). These ρ0 cells also exhibit a significantly reduced
baseline OCR (Figure 5a), indicative of defective
mitochondrial respiration. Notably, the localization of
pyrvinium to the mitochondria of LAMA84 and KU812
ρ0 cells was markedly reduced (Figure 5b). Furthermore,
the ATP levels of LAMA84 and KU812 ρ0 cells remained
constant even in the presence of pyrvinium exposure
(Figure 5c). These ρ0 cells were also resistant to apoptosis
induction by pyrvinium but not dasatinib (Figure 5d).
The inhibitory effect of pyrvinium on the proliferation
on CML ρ0 cells was not determined due to inadequate
proliferation of ρ0 cells (Supplemental Figure S6B and
S6C). Collectively, our data indicate that pyrvinium
specifically targets mitochondrial respiration, most likely
by binding to and inhibiting the function of a component

of oxidative phosphorylation encoded by the mtDNA.

DISCUSSION
The advent of BCR-ABL TKIs in the past 15
years has greatly improved the prognosis of CML.
Although these TKIs curb the unchecked growth of
CML progenitors and their progeny, they fail to eliminate
leukemia stem cells (LSC) that may be the ultimate driver
of disease relapse [24]. Targeting metabolic pathways for
cancer therapy has attracted attention ever since Warburg’s
seminal discovery of aerobic glycolysis [25]. However,
recent studies have suggested that Warburg’s paradigm of
reprogramming energy metabolism may not necessarily
apply to cancer stem cells. Consistent with the emerging
evidence showing that LSC rely heavily on oxidative
phosphorylation for survival [6, 7], we herein report the
identification of an FDA-approved drug, pyrvinium, that

ρ0 cells have minimal basal as well as spare oxygen consumption. OCR was measured using untreated cells without and in the presence

selectively eliminates primary BP-CML CD34+ progenitor
cells through induction of mitochondrial respiration
blockade. Importantly, pyrvinium induces apoptosis,
inhibits colony formation and blocks self-renewal of
CD34+ cells isolated from BP-CML patients who harbour
TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations (Supplemental
Table 1). The combination of pyrvinium and dasatinib is
superior to either drug alone (Figure 2), indicating that
the drug combination works synergistically to eradicate
cultured CML cells and CML xenografts. Furthermore,
pyrvinium alone or in combination with dasatinib showed
no overt toxicity to CD34+ cells from normal cord blood
(Figure 2). Taken together, the exquisite reliance of of BPCML stem/progenitor cells on oxidative phosphorylation
may offer a unique therapeutic opportunity in patients with
TKI-resistant disease. Our ongoing studies will determine
whether the combination of pyrvinium with dasatinib or
other TKIs is also effective in other preclinical CML blast
crisis mouse models [26].
The molecular target of pyrvinium has been hotly
debated over the past few years. This is largely attributed
to the difference in experimental readouts used to test this
FDA-approved anthelminthic compound for its potential
utility in cancer research and treatment. While reports
have clearly demonstrated that pyrvinium allosterically
activates CK1α to block Wnt/β-catenin signalling in colon
cancer and hedgehog signalling in medulloblastomas
respectively [15-17], others have shown that CK1α is
not the bona-fide target of pyrvinium in transformed
cells of the embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and leukemia
origin [12, 13, 27]. Notably, Harada et al showed that the
target of pyrvinium in myeloma/erythroleukemia cells
is the mitochondrial respiratory complex I [12]. Putting
all these findings into a unifying perspective, we showed
that the relative dependence of pyrvinium on CK1α for
its anti-proliferative property differs greatly between
breast and colon cancer cells and leukemia cells. While
we and others have shown that the presence of CK1α is
absolutely required for pyrvinium to exert its anti-cancer
effects on HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells [17], we also
demonstrated that CK1α depletion is insufficient to
rescue the growth of CML and AML cell lines exposed
to pyrvinium (Figure 3a-3d and Supplemental Figure S3).
Consistent with the work of Harada et al, we showed that
pyrvinium-induced cell death was significantly reduced
in CML ρ0 cells that cannot perform mitochondrial
respiration (Figure 5). These data indicate that pyrvinium
differentially targets solid and blood cancers via CK1α
activation and mitochondrial respiration inhibition,
respectively. Given that the localization of pyrvinium to
the mitochondria is markedly reduced in CML ρ0 cells
(Figure 5b), we speculate that pyrvinium likely targets
a component of the electron transport chain encoded by
the mitochondrial DNA. The mammalian mitochondrial
DNA encodes 13 polypeptides including subunits for
mitochondrial respiratory complex I, III and IV [23].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Since pyrvinium inhibits mitochondrial respiratory
complex I activities in myeloma cells [12], we speculate
that pyrvinium may target mitochondrial DNA encoded
subunits of complex I in CML cells.
Recent studies indicate that some tumors are highly
dependent on mitochondrial respiration for survival
[28, 29]. Targeting mitochondrial respiration by either
mitochondrial translation inhibition or BCL-2 inhibition
selectively eradicates AML stem/progenitor cells due to
their higher dependence on mitochondrial respiration than
normal hematopoietic counterparts [6, 7]. Based on our
findings that pyrvinium inhibits mitochondrial respiration
and targets BP-CML cells more effectively than normal
hematopoietic cells, we hypothesize that CML stem/
progenitor cells are more metabolically active and
dependent on mitochondrial respiration than are normal
hematopoietic counterparts. As our study demonstrates,
this dependency can be exploited by rationally targeted
therapy.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that pyrvinium
selectively targets BP-CML cells through inhibition of
mitochondrial respiration. Blockade of mitochondrial
respiration, combined with clinically approved BCRABL1 TKIs, induces BP-CML cell death in vitro and in
vivo. Hence, targeting mitochondrial respiration may
represent a new therapeutic strategy against aggressive
leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary cells
CD34+ cells were purified from bone marrow or
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of BP-CML patients
or from cord blood cells using CD34 MicroBead kit
(Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). CD34+ cells were cultured in
serum free medium using StemPro complete medium (Life
Technologies, CA, US) supplemented with cytokines (stem
cell factor, 200 pg/mL; granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor, 200 pg/mL; macrophage inflammatory
protein-1α, 200 pg/mL; granulocyte colony−stimulating
factor, 1000 pg/mL; leukemia inhibitory factor, 50 pg/mL;
and interleukin 6, 1000 pg/mL) similar to that found in
stroma-conditioned medium from long-term bone marrow
[30]. Primary CML samples were obtained from patients
seen at the Singapore General Hospital. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients under institutional
review board-approved protocols. Cord blood samples
were obtained from the Singapore Cord Blood Bank.

from Dr. S. Tiong Ong) were grown in RPMI1640 medium
containing 4 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies, CA,
US) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, UK).
Human HCT-116 colon cancer and SUM159 breast cancer
cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and cultured in accordance to ATCC’s
instruction. Mitochondria DNA-deficient LAMA84 ρ0 and
KU812 ρ0 cells were established by growing in RPMI1640
medium containing 10% FBS, 2 µg/ml ethidium bromide
(EtBr), 4 mM L-glutamine, 50 µg/ml uridine, 100 µg/
ml sodium pyruvate (Sigma, MO, US) for 50 days, and
thereafter maintained in above media without EtBr [31].

MTS proliferation assay kit (Life technologies, CA,
US). Combination studies were designed based on the
methods proposed by Chou and Talalay [19]. Briefly,
the concentrations of pyrvinium and dasatinib required
to inhibit 50% proliferation (IC50) was determined in
the single arm experiments. The cells were then treated
with increasing doses of pyrvinium or dasatinib or an
equipotent constant-ratio combination of both drugs. The
combination index (CI) at 50%, 75% and 90% growth
inhibition was calculated using the Calcusyn software
(Biosoft, UK) to determine if the combination was
synergistic (CI<0.9), additive (CI 0.9-1.1) or antagonistic
(CI>1.1). The use of crystal violet staining for cell growth
assays has been previously described [32].

Drugs

Colony-forming and serial replating assays

Pyrvinium (P0027, Sigma, MO, US) and dasatinib
(LC laboratories, LA, US) were dissolved in DMSO.
For the animal experiments, pyrvinium was dissolved in
50%/50% DMSO/saline and dasatinib was dissolved in 80
mM citric acid (pH 3.1).

Primary CD34+ cells (1000-5000) together with
drugs were plated in HSC-CFU complete methylcellulose
medium (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). After 2 weeks,
the number of colonies was scored and clusters with
more than 100 cells were counted as a colony. For serial
replating assays, individual colonies formed in CFU
assays were picked and replated in HSC-CFU complete
methylcellulose in a 96-well format. After 2-week
incubation, wells were scored as positive or negative for
the presence of colonies. Further rounds of serial replating
were performed until no more colonies formed. Serial
replating capacity is determined by the percentage of final
number of positive wells among total number of colonies
plated.

RNAi of human CK1α expression
Exponentially-growing leukemia cells at 1 × 106
were electroporated with 100 nM non-targeting siRNA

Mitochondria
localization

and

pyrvinium

Cell lines were incubated with either DMSO or 200
nM pyrvinium for 5 minutes in a cell culture incubator.
Cells were then washed with plain RPMI1640 and
incubated with 100 nM Mitotracker Green (Invitrogen,
CA, US) for 30 minutes in the cell culture incubator.
Hoechst stain (Invitrogen, CA, US) was added to the
cells and incubated for an additional 15 minutes. Cells
were washed with plain RPMI1640 for three times and
pelleted via centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes. Cell
pellets were resuspended with 200 µl plain RPMI1640
and transferred to NUNCTM Lab-TekTM II chamber slide
systems (Thermo Scientific, NY, US) for live cell imaging.
Images were acquired with 3D-Structure Illumination
Microscopy (3D-SIM) using a super resolution microscope
(Nikon, Japan) equipped with an iXonEM+885 EMCCD
camera (Andor) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted
microscope with a CFI Apo TIRF (1006/1.40 oil) objective
and processed with the NIS-Elements AR software.

Measurement of apoptosis
Assessment of apoptosis was performed by Annexin
V staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Beckman Coulter, France). After 72 hours of drug
incubation, cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and
analysed on a Beckman Coulter FC500.

Cell proliferation assay
CML cell lines were plated on 96-well-plates
and treated with graded doses of each drug for 72
hours. Cell proliferation activity was evaluated by the

GRANT SUPPORT

Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured
using the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyser as
previously described [33]. Briefly, cells were treated
with DMSO or pyrvinium for 24 hours. Five replicate
wells of 5x104 drug-treated cells was seeded in 24well XF24 well plates coated with BD Cell-Tak (BD
Biosciences, MA, US) in unbuffered DMEM. Analyses
were performed both at basal conditions and after injection
of oligomycin (OLI, 1 µg/ml), Carbonyl cyanide-ptrifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, 0.4 µM) and
Antimycin A and Rotenone combination (A&R, 2.5 µM
and 2.5 µM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For time course analysis, OCR was measured using
untreated cells both at basal conditions and after injection
of various concentrations of pyrvinium. ATP levels were
measured by CellTiter-Glo Luminiescent Cell Viability
Assay (Promega, WI, US) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

CML xenografts in SCID mouse

Editorial note

SCID mice at 6-8 weeks old were purchased from
InVivos Pte Ltd Singapore. All procedures were conducted
according to the guidelines approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Briefly, K562 (1x106)
cells in phosphate buffered saline were implanted
subcutaneously into the right flank of each SCID mouse.
Treatment was started when tumor volume reached
approximately 200 mm3. The mice were treated with
intraperitoneal pyrvinium 0.5 mg/kg daily, oral dasatinib
1 mg/kg daily or a combination of both. The control group
was treated with intraperitoneal 50%/50% DMSO/saline
and oral 80 mM citric acid. Tumor length and width were
measured daily and volumes were calculated as (length)2
x (width)/2.
Additional methods can be found in the
Supplemental Information.

This paper has been accepted based in part on peerreview conducted by another journal and the authors’
response and revisions as well as expedited peer-review
