ABSTRACT
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a poorly treated neoplasia arising from the
pleural mesothelial lining. Here we document that the leaf extract of Cynara scolymus
exerts broad antitumoral effects both in vitro and in vivo on mesothelioma cell lines.
We found that Cynara scolymus treatment affects strongly cell growth, migration
and tumor engraftment of mesothelioma cell lines. Strikingly, dietary feeding with
Cynara scolymus leaf extract reduces the growth of mesothelioma xenografted
tumors similarly to pemetrexed, a commonly employed drug in the treatment of
mesothelioma. In aggregate our findings suggest that leaf extract of Cynara scolymus
holds therapeutic potential for the treatment of mesothelioma.

in cancer transformation [11] [12]. Within the last five
decades, the natural products have continuously contributed
to drug discovery and development process [13] [14] [15].
Increasing evidences have shown that natural products,
including extracts and isolated chemicals, are multi-targeted
and can be considered as a model to approach chronic
diseases such as cancer. Actually, most natural agents do
not induce high level of toxicity and target simultaneously
multiple signalling pathways involved in cell growth,
apoptosis, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis [16] [17].
Since cancer is the result of a deregulation of multiple
signalling pathways and natural products elicit multi-targeted
activities, the latter could hold a great potential for treating
human tumors [18] [6]. The long period between asbestos
exposure and the development of disease may be a window
of opportunity for chemoprevention or dietary interventions.
It has been shown that some natural agents such as coffee,
resveratrol, curcumin and butein exert anticancer activities
in mesothelioma cellular systems [2] [10] [19] [19] [20].
Observational studies have shown that high adherence to
a Mediterranean diet, which encompasses a combination

INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an
aggressive tumour arising from the mesothelial lining of
the pleura, which remains compartmentalized for most of
the disease course [1] [2]. Current therapeutic approaches
include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Cisplatin
(CDDP) alone or with pemetrexed (PMTX) still represents
the current standard of care [3] [4] [5]. Similarly to most solid
tumours, the acquired resistance impedes the success of the
therapeutic response. Overall patient’s survival ranges from
8 and 18 months. Furthermore, there is not any diagnostic
tool that allows an early detection of the disease [2] [6].
Given the role played from the asbestos in the etiology of the
mesothelioma, this tumor is still considered an occupational
disease [7] [8] [9]. Mesothelioma is an orphan disease
with an increasing worldwide incidence, especially in the
developing countries where the asbestos is still exported
and not banned [9] [10]. After inhalation asbestos fibers
infiltrate pleural spaces and accumulate in black spots. This
leads to the induction of pleural fibrosis that might result

of characteristic foods such as fruits, vegetables fresh
produce, fish and seafood, nuts, legumes/pulses and olive
oil [21], is associated with a significant reduction in the
risk of overall cancer mortality (10%), colorectal cancer
(14%), prostate cancer (4%) and aero digestive cancer
(56%) [22]. The most diffuse phytochemicals in nature
are the classes of polyphenols. For long time, polyphenols
have been considered only for their antioxidants properties.
Recent data have revealed that polyphenols affect different
cell signalling pathways. This also occurs through the
modulation of microRNAs thereby affecting the expression
of their mRNA targets whose encoded proteins are critical
components of different pathways [23] [23]. Globe
artichoke (Cynara scolymus) is a fundamental component of
Mediterranean diet [24]. It has been reported that the edible
parts (receptacles with inner and intermediate bracts) and
leaves of artichokes represent a potent source of polyphenols
fractions. Recent data have revealed that polyphenols affect
different cell signalling pathways and exert their anticancer
effects along the different steps of carcinogenesis [25]
[26] [27]. Furthermore, the main components of Cynara
scolymus are caffeoylquinic acid derivatives (cynarin and
chlorogenic acid), flavonoids (luteolin and apigenin) and
bitters (cynaropicrin) [28] [29] [28]. Several in vitro and
in vivo experiments have shown that Cynara scolymus
exhibits choleretic, hepatoprotective, antibacterial,
antinflammatory, antithrombotic and hypocoles­terolemic
properties [30] [31] [32] [33]. Artichoke extracts are reported
to induce apoptosis and cytotoxic effects in cancer cells
[34] [35] [36]. In the present report we aimed to demonstrate
the anti-cancer activity of the artichoke leaf extract through
direct experimental tests, through the normalizing effect of
the extract on the cancer metabolic alterations and through
the evidence of extract antitumoral activity due to its
impact on signalling pathways of oncogenic significance.
We found that artichoke leaf extracts (freeze-dried extract
prepared as indicated in the methods section by the ABOCA
company- http://www.aboca.com) severely affect in vitro
and in vivo mesothelioma tumorigenicity. Indeed, the
artichoke leaf extract significantly reduces cell proliferation
and colony formation of diverse mesothelioma cell lines.
It also promotes apoptosis and restrains mesothelioma cell
migration and invasion. It also impairs engraftment and
reduces tumor volume of xenografted mesotheliomas. These
effects are similar to those induced by pemetrexed. Protein
array analyses reveal that the artichoke leaf extract activates
distinct set of proteins to those of pemetrexed or cisplatin that
might be critical mediators of its antitumoral activities.

mesothelioma cell lines and untransformed mesothelial
cells, HMC (Figure 1A–1C) with increasing concentrations
(ranging from 3 to 200 μg/ml) of artichoke leaf extract for
72 hrs. We determined the half-maximal concentration of
growth inhibition (IC50) for the extract phytocomplex in
MPM cells (Figure 1A–1C, Supplementary Table 1). We
found that the artichoke extract inhibited cell viability in a
dose dependent manner (Figure 1A–1C). Moreover, MSTO211H cells treated with the artichoke extract showed a
change in the cellular morphology both in a short-term assay
that in long term as showed in Supplementary Figure 1.
In contrast, HMC cells were more resistant to the growth
inhibitory effect of the artichoke extract (Figure 1A–1C).
Next, we performed a colony-forming assay to evaluate
the capability of mesothelioma cells to form colonies after
the removal of the extract. We found that the artichoke leaf
extract inhibited the colony forming ability of MSTO-211H,
MPP-89 and NCI-H28 cells (Figure 1D–1F). Altogether
these findings indicated that the artichoke leaf extract
treatment is highly effective on cell proliferation and colony
forming ability of mesothelioma cell lines.

RESULTS

The artichoke leaf extract severely impairs
migration and invasion of mesothelioma
cell lines

The artichoke leaf extract induces apoptosis
of MPM cell lines
The induction of apoptosis is a pivotal event for
successful cancer treatment by natural agents. To this end,
we assessed whether the artichoke leaf extract induced
apoptosis of mesothelioma cell lines using different
approaches. Cytofluorimetric analysis revealed that the
artichoke extract induced the appearance of a subG1 peak
in MSTO-211H and MPP-89 cells. This effect was dosedependent (Figure 2A–2D). Furthermore, cells treated
with the artichoke leaf extract for 24 hrs became Annexin
V-positive in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2E–2F).
We also found that the extract treatment led to increased
cleavage of caspase 3, caspase7 and Parp (Figure 2G).
Comet assay performed in MSTO-211H and in HMC cells
revealed that Cisplatin (7, 5 μg/ml, for 20 h) treatment
induced DNA damage of both cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 2A, 2B). Interestingly, the exposure to the artichoke
leaf extract, used at not apoptotic concentration, 3 μg or
6  μg/ml, did not induce DNA damage (Supplementary
Figure 2A, 2B) and reduced that induced by CDDP in
HMC cells (Supplementary Figure 2A). Overall, these
results clearly demonstrate that the artichoke leaf extract
affects cell viability of MPM cell lines by inducing
apoptosis.

The artichoke leaf extract inhibits MPM cell
growth and proliferation

It has been previously reported that dietary phenolic
acids, monophenols and polyphenols possess inhibitory
properties against the invasive and metastatic behaviours
of different cancer cells lines.

We aimed first to test the effects of the artichoke
extract on mesothelioma cell growth and proliferation. To
this end, we treated MSTO-211H, MPP-89 and NCI-H28

The artichoke leaf extract affects in vivo
tumor growth

To this end, we investigated whether the artichoke
leaf extract impaired migration and invasiveness of MPM
cell lines. First, we performed scratch wound closure assay
(Figure 3A, 3B) in MPM cell lines treated with different,
not apoptotic, concentrations of the extract. We found
that the artichoke extract inhibited, in a time dependent
manner, migration of MSTO-211H and MPP89 as wound
closure occurred slower than that of the control cells (Figure
3A–3B). As matter of fact, the artichoke leaf extract at the
concentration of 6 μg/ml and 12 μg/ml inhibited MSTO211H cells migration of 50% and 35% respectively as
well as in MPP89 cell line (Figure 3A–3B). Second, we
performed invasion assay in MSTO-211H cells using a
24-well chamber with a non-coated 8-mm pore size filter
in the presence of different concentrations of extract (6 μg
and 12 μg/ml). As shown in figure 3C, the artichoke leaf
extract markedly reduced the invasion of MSTO-211H cells.
Altogether these results indicated that the artichoke extract
inhibited migration and invasion of mesothelioma cell lines.

We aimed to assess in vivo the antitumoral effects
of the extract. First, we evaluated whether the artichoke
leaf extract could affect the engraftment of MSTO211H cells. To this end, MSTO-211H cells were treated
for 24 hrs with vehicle or artichoke extract at 50 μg/
ml. Cell suspensions were subcutaneously injected into
CD1 mice. As shown in figure 4A, cells pre-treated
with the extract engrafted less efficiently than vehicletreated cells when inoculated into CD1 mice. We next
evaluated the efficacy of the extract to inhibit the
growth of xenografted mesotheliomas subcutaneously
implanted in CD1 nude mice. To this end, CD1 mice
were subcutaneously transplanted with MSTO-211H
(2 × 106). At the evidence of tumor progression,
mice were randomly divided in five different groups
(n = 6) and were beverage with vehicle or artichoke leaf

extract at different concentrations (25, 50 and 75 mg/ml)
in drinking water (Table 2). Dietary feeding of the
artichoke leaf extract for 3 weeks reduced significantly
and dose dependent the growth of xenografted
mesothelioma tumors (Figure 4B). This effect was
similar to that induced by PMTX, a drug commonly
employed in the treatment of mesothelioma (Figure 4B).
To evaluate the proliferation index xenografted tumors
were stained for Ki67 expression. Strikingly, we found
that xenografted tumors derived from the extract treated
mice exhibited significantly lower Ki67 expression than
those treated with vehicle (Figure 4C, 4D). We also
found that artichoke leaf extracts sensitized MSTO-211H
and NCI-H28 mesothelioma cell lines to pemetrexedinduced cell killing (Supplementary Figure 3A-B).
Similarly, artichoke leaf extract at 75 mg/ml potentiated
the antitumoral effect of pemetrexed on tumor volume
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of xenografted tumors (Supplementary Figure 3C).
Altogether these findings indicate that the artichoke leaf
extract can affect in vivo the growth of mesothelioma
cell lines.

Artichoke leaf extract induces changes in
metabolic profiles of MSTO-211H cells
Since metabolic alterations are among the hallmarks
of a cancer cell we aim to assess whether the artichoke
leaf extract could affect the metabolism of MSTO-211H
cells. 1H-NMR metabolomics profiles of MSTO-211H cell
culture media displayed significant differences between
artichoke-treated and vehicle-treated cells. Initially, we
explored the NMR data through an unsupervised approach
such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) carried out
on a dataset of treated and untreated medium samples.

p < 0.05. C. Percentage of invading cells over vehicle. MSTO-211H cells were treated at the indicated doses of extract. Error bars represent

The results reported in Figure  5A highlighted significant
differences between the two groups on PC1 (p = 0.013).
Subsequently, to identify the variables (metabolites) that have
a major contribution to the discrimination between samples,
we analyzed the loadings values from O-PLS-DA with a
threshold of 0.8 (Figure 5B, 5C). LV1 included the following
variables with the highest correlation levels: 3-methyl-2oxovalerate, acetate, N-acetyl groups, glutamax and succinate
with positive loadings and arginine, pyruvate, tyrosine and
phenylalanine with negative loadings. Therefore, considering
the net balance of these metabolites, LV1 indicated that
artichoke extract induced higher consumption of arginine,
pyruvate, tyrosine and phenylalanine as well as a lower
consumption of glutamax and succinate. Moreover, artichoke
extract-treated cells exhibited higher production of 3-methyl2-oxovalerate, acetate and N-acetyl groups than vehicle-tread
ones. This suggests that exposure to artichoke leaf extract
mainly affected the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), arginine and
proline metabolism, glutamine and glutamate metabolism,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

alanine, aspartate tyrosine metabolism and phenylalanine
metabolism (Table 3).

The artichoke leaf extract antitumoral activity
impinges on different signalling pathways
Since the artichoke extract appears to exert broad
anti-tumoral effects on mesothelioma cell lines, we aimed
to assess which signalling pathways might be involved.
To this end, we performed a phospho-antibody array
containing 1318 antibodies representative of key proteins
involved in over than 30 signalling pathways altered in
cancer among which proliferation, apoptosis, invasion,
migration, metabolism and angiogenesis. MSTO-211H
cells were treated for 24 hrs with the artichoke extract
(50 μg/ml) or vehicle and the derived protein lysates were
used to probe the antibody array. The heatmap shown
in figure 6A represented the signal intensities of those
proteins whose levels of expression or phosphorylation

CD1 mice were subcutaneously transplanted with MSTO-211H (2 × 106). At the evidence of tumor progression (when tumor
volume reached 60 mm3) mice were randomly allocated in placebo and in the artichoke leaf extract-treated groups as described in
the table. A control group of mice was intraperitoneally injected with Pemetrexed at the dose of 100 mg/kg for five consecutive days
aberrant activation of the WNT signalling pathway plays
a role in mesothelioma tumorigenesis we investigated
whether the treatment with the artichoke extract of MPM
cell lines modulated the expression of diverse components
of this pathway. We found that the artichoke leaf extract
reduced β-catenin nuclear staining in two mesothelioma
cell lines (Figure 7A–7B). This paired with the reduced
expression of well-known β-catenin target genes such
as LEF1, FGF8, COX2, MMP2 and VEGF transcripts
(Figure 7C) [39]. Altogether these findings highlight the
possibility that the broad antitumoral activities of the
artichoke leaf extract on mesothelioma cell lines might
occur through the modulation of diverse signalling
pathways commonly altered in human cancers.

mesothelioma. It has been previously reported that
artichoke phenol extracts can promote apoptosis and
impair invasiveness of different cancer cell lines [34–36].
We found that the artichoke extract exerts in vitro and
in vivo a broad anti-tumoral effect by strongly affecting
MPM growth, migration and invasion. Next-generation
sequence technologies have tremendously contributed
to decipher tumor landscape and to dissect tumor
heterogeneity. This has further established that cancer is
the consequence of a broad array of genetic and epigenetic
alterations. Modern drugs in the form of single-chemical
entities have been successful in the treatment of acute
conditions such as infectious diseases. Drug action is
fast and predictable, leading to a favourable resolution
of a critical situation in a short period of time. The
situation is markedly different when treating complex
chronic conditions such as cancer, type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases. In particular considering cancer
development, carcinogenesis process is multistep (that
is, it results from accumulated genetic and epigenetic
alterations), multipath (that is, multiple functional
pathways are involved, such as self-sufficiency in growth
signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, apoptosis

expansion leading to intraepithelial spread). More than
250 population-based studies, including case–control and
cohort studies, indicate that people who eat about five
servings of fruit and vege day have approximately half
the risk of developing cancer, particularly cancers of the
digestive and respiratory tracts, of those who eat fewer
than two servings. The NCI has identified about 35 plantbased foods that possess cancer-preventive properties.
These include garlic, soybeans, ginger, onion, turmeric,
tomatoes and cruciferous vegetables (for example,
broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts).
Thus, the plants contain numerous substances, some
of them pharmacologically active other inert but still
potentially interacting with the active ones to potentiate

the effectiveness as anticancer agents. The effectiveness
as anticancer agent of a given plant could be endowed
in its complexity (number of composing substances)
coupled with multi-targeting activity. In aggregate this
might allow concomitant untangling of diverse cancer
pathways. Congruently, both metabolomics and antibody
array analysis of MPM cells revealed that the artichoke
leaf extract affects concomitantly different signalling
pathways. We found that the extract affects β-catenin
nuclear expression which pairs with the downregulation of
the expression of its target genes such as LEF-1, FGF18,
COX-2, MMP2 and VEGF. It was previously shown that
direct targeting of β-catenin sensitizes mesothelioma cell
lines to the treatment with cytotoxic drugs [40]. WNT
is together with RAS, PI3K, Hippo and BCL among
those pathways that are mostly altered in mesotheliomas
[41]. We also found that the artichoke extract induces

phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 on
Ser9. Saito et al., have shown that phosphorylation of p53
on Ser 46, as well as on Ser 9 was dependent from ATM
protein kinases in response to ionizing radiation [42]. This
led to p53 stabilization, transcriptional activation and
induction of apoptosis. ATM-mediated phosphorylation
on Ser 15 and at nearby residues including Ser 6 and Ser
9 enhanced p53 apoptotic activities. Piccolo’s group has
shown that p53 phosphorylation on Ser 9 was instrumental
for the activation of the TGF-β cytostatic program [43].
AKT/PKB is frequently activated in tumors and is an
important player for signalling pathways that regulate
growth and survival. Fully active AKT/PKB mediates
numerous cellular functions including metabolism,
angiogenesis, growth, proliferation, survival, protein
synthesis, transcription, and apoptosis. We found that
artichoke leaf extract reduced both protein levels of
AKT1 and of its phosphorylation at Ser473 that enables
fully activation of the signalling axis involving insulin
receptor, IRS and PI3 kinase. This pairs with our
metabolomics data indicating that artichoke leaf extract
affects the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), arginine and proline
metabolism, glutamine and glutamate metabolism,
alanine, aspartate tyrosine metabolism and phenylalanine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metabolism (Table 3). Thus, artichoke leaf extract might
impact on crucial metabolic pathways that are aberrantly
activated in human cancers. Altogether these evidences
contribute to categorize artichoke leaf extract as a natural
product with broad antitumoral activity on malignant
pleural mesothelioma. Due to the evidence that the
signalling pathways altered in mesothelioma and affected
by artichoke leaf extracts are common to other human
malignancies we might expect that cynara scolymus could
exert antitumoral effects on other types of human cancers
(Supplementary Figure 5). Data shown in figure 1A-F
and Supplementary Figures 2A-B and 3A-C provide in
vitro and in vivo evidence for a co-treatment of artichoke
leaf extracts with either cisplatin or pemetrexed. Indeed,
artichoke leaf extract, unlike cisplatin that provoked DNA
damage to both mesothelial (HMC) and mesothelioma
cell lines, exerted a more pronounced apoptotic effects
on MPM cell lines than HMC. Interestingly artichoke
leaf extracts reduced DNA damage of HMC cells upon
cisplatin treatment, thereby suggesting that its co-treatment
with either cisplatin or pemetrexed not only potentiates
their antitumoral effects but might also confers selectivity
toward tumor cells. Natural products are also the leading
compounds for chemopreventive strategies. This is mainly

disease with a latency up to 40–50 years that represents
an extraordinary time window for a chemopreventive

leaf extract in an asbestos-exposed population is currently

Cell lines
The human MPM cell lines MSTO-211H, NCI-H28,
MPP89 were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD).
HMC, human mesothelial cells, were purchased from
Tebu-Bio (Le Perray en- Yvelines, France). All MPM cell
lines, were cultured as monolayers at 37°C and 5% CO2
in DMEM/F12 + GLUTAMAX (InVitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) supplemented with 10% non-heat inactivated FBS
(Gibco, Life Technologies, USA) and 0, 5 Unit/ml insulin
(Humulin, Eli Lilly and Company, Indiana, USA), while
HMC were cultured in Mesothelial cell basal medium
(Zen-Bio, Research Triangle Park, NC).

Extraction procedure and phytochemical
characterization
Frozen artichoke leaf samples were extracted (DER
from 5 to 6:1) by hydro-alcoholic procedure (ETOH 50%).
The phytocomplex consists of a partially purified mixture
of polyphenolic compounds and terpenes extracted from
artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) enriched in caffeoylquinic
acids, chlorogenic acid and cynaropicrine. It is a pending
Aboca’s patent (RM2014A000685). It was submitted to a
complete characterization of the composition by means of
metabolomic analysis (LC-ESI/MS) (as previously described
[28] and by quantitative analysis of caffeoylquinic acids
(SFM), chlorogenic acid (HPLC-UV) and cynaropicrine
(HPLC-UV). The complete chemical classes of compounds
(phenols, terpenes, fats, proteins, amino acids, minerals,
polysaccharides, etc.) addictionally analysed and presents in
the phytocomplex are listed in Table 1.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability of treated cells was assessed using
ATPlite assay (Perkin Elmer, Massachusset, USA)
accordingly to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell
viability tests were carried out to determine the efficacy
of Cynara scolymus concentrations using different plant
fractions and lot numbers. Cells (8 × 102 cells) were
seeded in 96 well-plates and cultured for 24 hrs and treated
for 72 hrs with Cynara scolymus leaf extracts. Each plate
was evaluated immediately on a microplate reader (Expire
Technology, Perkin Elmer).

Chemicals and antibodies
Artichoke capsules (Aboca, Sansepolcro, Italy);
Pemetrexed (ALIMTA, Eli Lilly and Company, Indiana,
USA) and Cisplatin (Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Group,
New York, USA) were dissolved according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The following primary
antibodies were used: anti-cleaved PARP (Asp214) (Cell
Signaling, # 9541); anti-caspase 7 (Cell Signaling, #9492);
anti-caspase 3 (Enzo life Science, #31A1067); anti-beta
actin (A-2228, SIGMA); β-catenin antibody (clone
CAT-5H10, # 18–0226. Zymed). Secondary horseradish

Clonogenic assays
MPM cell lines were grown at 70% confluence and
treated with Cynara scolymus leaf extracts or with vehicle.
Sixteen hrs later, cells were detached and seeded at 600
cells per 6 well into six-well dishes (Corning-Costar,
Tewksbury, MA, USA) in drug-free media. Fresh media
(25%) was added every three days. After 15–21 days,
colonies were stained with crystal violet and colonies
counted.

and then run in running solution (300mM NaOH, 1mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 13.0) for 30 min at
25V and 250 mA. DNA was equilibrated with 0.4M Tris
(pH 8.0) and slides were dried with methanol. DNA was
stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) and pictures were
taken using 63 × magnification at an Axiovert 200 M
microscope and Axiovision acquisition program (Zeiss).
At least 300 cells were scored for each slide.

To determine the effect of artichoke leaf extracts on
the cell cycle FACS analysis was carried out. For propidium
iodide (PI) staining, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at
a density of 104 cells/ml. After 24 hrs cells were treated
with indicated plant extract concentrations for different
time intervals. Floating and attached cells were harvested,
washed in PBS, fixed in ice-cold ethanol (70% v/v) and
stored at −20°C. For the analysis, cells were washed in PBS
and incubated with RNase A (1 mg/ml) and PI (40 μg/ml)
was added. For PI/Annexin V double staining treated cells
were harvested and suspended in binding buffer (HEPES
pH 7.4, CaCl2 2.5 mM, NaCl 140 mM). Aliquots of cells
were incubated for 15 min with Annexin V FITC (0, 2 μg/
ml) (Abcam, ab-63556) and PI (5 mg/ml) (Invitrogen). For
each FACS analysis, 3x 103 events for each sample were
analyzed. Flow cytometry analyses were carried out with
Easycyte 8HT (Guava, Millipore) followed by analysis
using InCyte software (Millipore).

Western blot analysis
Cell lysis was performed on ice for 30 min in NP40
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
NP-40, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mM PMSF, 3 mM
NaF, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaVO4). Equal amounts of total
proteins extracts (30 μg) were resolved by 8% denaturing
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE),
and transferred for 2 hrs to polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% milkTBS-0.05% Tween 20 for 1 hour and incubated overnight
with the specific primary antibodies (see chemicals and
antibodies section).

Transwell invasion assay
Migration assay was performed using a 24-well
Boyden chamber with a non-coated 8-mm pore size filter in
the insert chamber (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
Cells were suspended in 0.5 ml DMEM/F12 media without
containing FBS and seeded into the insert chamber. Cells
were allowed to migrate for 24 hrs into the bottom chamber
containing 0.5 ml of DMEM/F12 media containing 10%
FBS in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Migrated cells that attached to the outside of the filter were
visualized by staining with DAPI and counted. The average
number of cells per field was expressed as percentage of the
control after normalizing for cell number.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
Briefly, MSTO-211H cells were seeded into eightchamber culture slides (BD Falcon). The next day, cells
were rinsed with ice-cold PBS buffer and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10′ at room temperature and then
permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100. The cells were
incubated overnight with the indicated antibody. The day
after, cells were washed with cold PBS three times for 3 min
each and stained for 2 hrs with a secondary antibody Alexa
488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes
Cells) and counterstained with DAPI (40, 6-diamidino-2phenylindole, dihydrochloride). Cells were examined under
a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning fluorescence confocal
microscope (Zeiss, Wetzlar, Germany).

Wound–healing migration assay
MPM cells were grown to 80% of confluence in
6-well tissue culture plates and wounded with a sterile
10-mL pipet tip to remove cells. PBS washing was used
to remove loosely attached cells. The progression of
migration was at photographed at different times under
a light microscope. The number of cells migrated into the
scratched area was calculated.

Sample preparation for NMR spectroscopy
Each medium sample (2 ml) was lyophilized,
then dissolved in 700 μl of 1 mM TSP [sodium salt of
3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic-2, 2, 3, 3-d4 acid], 10 mM
sodium azide D2O phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.4)
and finally homogenized by vortex mixing for 1 min. After
centrifugation (10 min, 10.000 RCF at 22°C), 600 μl of
each resulting supernatant was transferred to a 5-mm
NMR tube and used for the NMR analysis.

Comet assays
Cells were pre-treated with or without 3 μg or 6 μg/ul
of Cynara scolymus for 16 hrs. After that, cells were
treated or not with CDDP, 7.5 µg/ml, for 20 hrs. After
treatment, cells were detached with trypsin and embedded
in 1% low melting agarose (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered
saline and spread onto microscopy slides coated previously
with 1% agarose (Bio-Rad). Cells were lysed in the lysis
solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, 10mM Tris base, 8 g/l NaOH, 1% Triton X-100,

sequence with 4 transients per increment for a total
of 32 increments. These were collected into 16 k data
points using spectral widths of 6 kHz in F2 and 40 Hz
in F1. There was a 2.0 s relaxation delay. Each FID was
Fourier transformed after a multiplication with sine-bell/
exponential function in the F2 dimension and a sine-bell
function in the F1 dimension. JRES spectra were tilted
by 45°, symmetrised about F1, referenced to TSP at dH
= 0.0 ppm and the proton-decoupled skyline projections
(p-JRES) exported using Agilent VNMRJ 3.2 software.
Metabolites responsible for the separation between treated
and untreated samples were identified using an in-house
NMR database and Chenomx NMR suite v. 7.7 (Chenomx
Inc., Alberta, Canada).

Cy3-conjugated streptavidin. Each slide (containing six
replicates) hybridized and Cy3 fluorescence acquired
by microarray scanner with a scan resolution of 10 mm
(Agilent Technologies). The images were quantified
using Agilent Feature Extraction (AFE) software (Agilent
Technologies). The fluorescence signal of each antibody
was obtained from the fluorescence intensity of this
antibody spot after subtraction of the blank signal (spot in
the absence of antibody).

Statistical analysis
Bionformatic analysis was performed with Matlab
(The MathWorks Inc.). Z score transformation was used
to express the background corrected spot intensity values
as unit of a standard deviation from the normalized
mean of zero [45]. Features were selected basing on Z
ratios calculated by taking the difference between the
averages of the observed protein Z scores and dividing
by the standard deviation of all the differences for
that particular comparison. A Z-ratio that was higher
than 1.96 was inferred as significant. Unsupervised
Hierarchical Clustering was used to investigate clusters
of samples. Pathway analysis was performed by DAVID
program [46] [47].

NMR spectra pre-processing treatment
The 1D skyline projections exported were aligned
and then reduced into spectral bins with ranging from
0.01 to 0.02 ppm by using the ACD intelligent bucketing
method (1D NMR Manager software (ACD/Labs, Toronto,
Canada). To compare the spectra, the integrals derived
from the binning procedure were normalized to the total
integral region, following exclusion of bins representing
the residual water peak (4.33–5.17 ppm) and the TSP peak
(0.5–0.5 ppm).
The resulting data was used as input for multivariate
analysis: Principal Component Analysis (PCA and
Orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant
analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed using SIMCA-P +
version 12 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden).

EnSpire® cellular label-free platform
MSTO-211H cells were seeded in specially designed
384- well plate with highly precise optical sensors able
to measure changes in light refraction resulting from
dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) within the cell’s
monolayer. Change in the light refraction was indicated
by a shift in wavelength.

Phospho-protein profiling by the phospho
explorer antibody microarray
The Phospho Explorer antibody microarray, which
was designed and manufactured by Full Moon Biosystems,
Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA), contains 1318 antibodies [44].
Each of the antibodies has two replicates that are printed
on a coated glass microscope slide, along with multiple
positive and negative controls (Supplementary Figure 4).
The antibody array experiment was performed using Full
Moon Biosystems, according to their established protocol.
In brief, cell lysates obtained from MSTO-211H treated
with the artichoke extract at 50 μg/ml or with Cisplatin
at 8 μM or Pemetrexed at 30 μM of concentrations for
24 hrs, were biotinylated with the antibody array assay kit
(Full Moon Biosystems, Inc.). The antibody microarray
slides were first blocked with a blocking solution (Full
Moon Biosystems, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature,
rinsed with Milli-Q grade water for 3–5 min. The slides
were then incubated with the biotin-labeled cell lysates in
coupling solution (Full Moon Biosystems, Inc.) at room
temperature for 2 hrs. The array slides were washed 4 to
5 times with 1x Wash Solution (Full Moon Biosystems,
Inc.) and rinsed extensively with Milli-Q grade water
before detection of bound biotinylated proteins using

Experimental animals and ethics statement
Xenograft transplantation
MSTO-211H cells were pre-treated with the
artichoke extract (50 μg/ml) for 24 hrs. Suspensions
of 2 × 106 MSTO-211H cells x mouse (n = 6)
were subcutaneously injected in PBS 1x/Matrigel
(BD Biosciences San Jose, CA, USA) into 6-weeks-old
female CD1 mice (Charles River, Milan). Tumor volume
was calculated by using the formula: V 1/2 x length
x width2 (by electronic caliper).
Animal studies
CD1 mice were subcutaneously transplanted
with MSTO-211H (2 × 106). At the evidence of
tumor progression (when tumor volume reached
60 mm3) animals were randomly divided in five groups.
Drinking water and a complete pellet diet (GLP 4RF21,
Mucedola) were supplied ad libitum. Three groups
of mice (n = 6) were given the artichoke extract in
drinking water at the following concentrations: 25,
50 and 75 mg/ml, whereas mice of the control group
18148

Oncotarget

(n = 6) were given tap. In the last group, pemetrexed
was injected intraperitoneally at the dose of 100 mg/
kg for five consecutive days. Body weight and clinical
signs of the mice were checked every 3 days. All
tumorigenicity assays were performed according to the
guidelines set by the internal ethical committee. At the

Immunoistochemical analysis
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 5 μm
sections from mice tumor sections were stained with
haematoxylin and eosin or stained with anti-ki67 antibody
(ab15580, Abcam). Seven fields chosen randomly from
each sample were scored.
