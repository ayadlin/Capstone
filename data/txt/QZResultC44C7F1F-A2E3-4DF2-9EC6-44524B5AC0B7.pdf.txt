ABSTRACT
YY1 is a DNA-binding transcription factor and reported to be involved in cancer
progression. Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) could inhibit proliferation and
promote apoptosis of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, it is unclear
about the roles of YY1 in the sensitivity of HCC cells to HDACi. In this study, firstly,
we identified two drug-response profiles to HDACi in HCC cell lines, while our results
showed that HDAC1 expression was positively correlated with YY1 in HCC cell lines and
primary tumor tissues. Secondly, YY1 decreased the sensitivity of HCC cells to HDACi
in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that YY1 promoted HDAC1 expression by
binding to its promoter, while HDAC1 in turn up-regulated the expression of YY1. In
conclusion, our results showed that YY1 could reduce the sensitivity of HCC cells to
HDACi and might be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.

incidence and progression [4]. Currently, there are four
major classes of HDACs including the class I HDACs
(HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8), class II HDACs (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9
and 10), Class III HDACs (Sirtuins) and class IV HDACs
(HDAC11). More and more evidences indicated that
HDACs could affect many cancerous behaviors including
cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion in many cancers
including HCC [5, 6]. Consequently, HDAC inhibitor
(HDACi) has exhibited important antitumor activities
in vitro and in vivo, and has been used in clinical treatments
for patients with cancers [7, 8]. For HCC, pan-HDCA
inhibitor resminostat could offer a new therapeutic option
for patients with advanced HCC [9], which suggested that
HDACi might be an important strategy for HCC treatment.
In recent years, many genes were reported to
regulate the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs and be important biomarkers for predicting clinical
responses to chemotherapeutic drugs including HDACi.
For example, HR23B governed the sensitivity of cutaneous
T cell lymphoma cells to HDACi and was demonstrated
as a biomarker for tumor cell sensitivity to HDACi [10].
Another report showed that RNH1 suppressed HDACi-

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common and malignant tumors in the world. Moreover,
the majority of HCC patients are diagnosed at an
advanced stage and conventional chemotherapy is usually
ineffective. Until now, the mortality rate of HCC is still
very high [1]. In the past few years, more and more studies
showed that the molecular targeting therapy provided an
opportunity for the treatment of patients with cancers
including HCC. For example, Sorafenib, a multikinase
inhibitor, is one of the molecular targeted drugs in treating
patients with advanced HCC [2]. However, the median life
expectancy of HCC patients extended by Sorafenib was
not long and many patients developed acquired resistance
to sorafenib [3]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a
novel molecular targeting therapy for HCC.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are an important
family of enzymes which deacetylate the amino group
of the lysine residues in the histone tails to form a closed
chromatin configuration and played important roles in
epigenetic regulation of key genes involved in cancer

induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contributed
to HDACi resistance in gastric cancer cells [11]. Until
now, there have been few reports focusing on the genes
regulating the sensitivity of HCC cells to HDACi. In the
past few years, the transcription factor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1),
which is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved, has
been reported to regulate expressions of downstream genes
to affect the sensitivity and resistance of cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs [12]. YY1 was also demonstrated
to interact with HDACs including HDAC1, 2 and 3
[13–15]. Furthermore, YY1 was reported to be
significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues [16]. In view
of the facts above, YY1 might play an important role in
regulating the sensitivity of HCC cells to HDACi.
In this study, we found that YY1 expression
exhibited a positive correlation with HDAC1 in cell
lines and tumor tissues of HCC. We also investigated the
reciprocal regulation between YY1 and HDAC1, and the
roles of YY1 in sensitivity of HCC cells to HDACi in vitro
and in vivo. Our findings revealed a novel role of YY1 in
predicting drug sensitivity of HCC.

involved in the sensitivity and resistance of cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results also showed that
YY1 level was higher in high-dose sensitive HCC cells and
exhibited a positive correlation with HDAC1 in HCC cell
lines (Figure 2D and 2E). Western blot analysis showed
that protein levels of both HDAC1 and YY1 were higher in
high-dose sensitive HCC cell lines SMMC-7721 and HUH7 than that in low-dose sensitive HCC cell lines HEPG2
and BEL-7404 (Figure 2F and Supplementary Figure 1).
Furthermore, we measured HDAC1 and YY1 levels
in 50 pairs of HCC tissues and paired adjacent non-tumor
tissues (ANLTs). Our results showed that both HDAC1
and YY1 levels were higher in HCC tissues than that in
ANLTs (Figure 2G and 2H). Correlation analysis indicated
that YY1 levels exhibited a positive relationship with
HDAC1 in HCC tissues (Figure 2I).

YY1 binds to the promoter of HDAC1 and
promotes its expression
In order to explore the mechanism underlying the
correlation between YY1 and HDAC1, we analyzed the
promoter of HDAC1 by TransFac and JASPAR database,
and one potential binding site of YY1 was identified. Then a
1.2 kb fragment of the human HDAC1 promoter with wide
type (wt) or mutant (mut) predicted YY1 binding site was
inserted into the luciferase reporter plasmid (Figure 3A).
Luciferase reporter analysis showed that overexpression
of YY1 led to an increase in luciferase activity of the wtHDAC1-promoter plasmid in HEPG2 cells, while mut YY1
binding site attenuated the increase of luciferase activity
(Figure 3B). In addition, ChIP assay clearly showed that
the predicted YY1-binding site in HDAC1 promoter
presented the ability to bind to YY1 protein (Figure 3C).
Moreover, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that
overexpression of YY1 could increase both mRNA and
protein levels of HDAC1 in HEPG2 cells (Figure 3D and
3F, Supplementary Figure 2A–2B), while knockdown of
YY1 decrease the levels of HDAC1 in SMMC-7721 cells
(Figure 3E and 3G, Supplementary Figure 2C–2D).

RESULTS
HDACi treatment defines two drug-response
profiles in HCC cell lines
In order to explore the effects of HDACi on different
HCC cell lines, firstly we evaluated the sensitivity of
HCC cell lines to non-specific HDACis SAHA and TSA
by calculating IC50 values (Figure 1A). According to the
ward’s cluster analysis, five HCC cell lines were classified
as high-dose sensitive cell lines to HDACi with IC50
values above 6 μM for SAHA and 400 nM for TSA, while
the other five HCC cell lines were classified as low-dose
sensitive cell lines to HDACi (Figure 1A and 1B).
We treated the five high-sensitive cell lines as one
group and the five low-sensitive cell lines as another,
measured and compared cell viabilities of HCC cells
between the two groups treated with SAHA or TSA at
different time points. Our results showed that there were
more viable cells in high-dose than that in low-dose
sensitive HCC cell lines after treatment with SAHA or
TSA at various time points (Figure 1C and 1D).

YY1 decreases the sensitivity of HCC cells to
HDACi in vitro
To determine whether YY1 could affect sensitivity
of HCC cells to HDACi, we overexpressed and knocked
down YY1 expression in HCC cells, and measured cell
proliferation and apoptosis under HDACi treatment at
different drug concentrations or time points. The evaluated
HDACi concentration and treatment time presented
proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of HCC
cells. Our results showed that YY1 overexpression could
significantly promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell
apoptosis of HEPG2 cells under HDACi treatments at
different drug concentrations and treatment times (Figure
4A–4D). While knockdown of YY1 inhibited proliferation

HDAC1 expression was positively correlated
with YY1 in HCC cell lines and tumor tissues
To explain the possible mechanism underlying the
differential responses of HCC cells to HDACi, firstly,
we measured mRNA levels of three main class I HDACs
including HDAC1, 2 and 3 in high-dose and low-dose
sensitive HCC cell lines. QRT-PCR analysis showed
that expression of HDAC1, but not HDAC2 and 3, was
significantly higher in high-dose than that in low-dose
sensitive HCC cells (Figure 2A–2C). YY1 could be

HDACi treatments (Figure 4E–4H). These results
indicated that YY1 obviously decreased the sensitivity of
HCC cells to HDACi in vitro.

other group (Figure 5A and 5B). Immunohistochemistry
assay showed that the expression of proliferation marker
KI67 was down-regulated in tumor tissues of siYY1 plus
SAHA mouse group (Figure 5C). Accordingly, we found
that HDAC1 levels were lower in two siYY1 groups
than that in corresponding siNC groups (Figure 5D),
suggesting the regulatory effects of YY1 on HDAC1
expression in vivo.

Knockdown of YY1 promotes the sensitivity of
HCC cells to HDACi in vivo
An HCC xenograft mouse model was used to explore
the effects of YY1 on HDACi sensitivity of HCC cells
in vivo. HCC xenograft mice were divided into four
groups: siNC plus DMSO, siNC plus SAHA, siYY1 plus
DMSO and siYY1 plus SAHA. There was no statistical
difference in tumor sizes between siNC plus DMSO group
and siNC plus SAHA group. We also found no statistical
difference between siNC plus DMSO group and siYY1
plus DMSO group. However, tumor sizes in siYY1 plus

YY1 expression was inhibited by HDACi and upregulated by HDAC1
In this study, we also explored the effects of HDACi
on YY1 expression. We measured YY1 expression in
SMMC-7721 cells with SAHA and TSA treatments. QRTPCR and western blot analysis showed that either SAHA

DISCUSSION

or TSA could decrease the mRNA and protein levels
of HDAC1 and YY1 (Figure 6A–6D, Supplementary
Figure 3). Interestingly, overexpression of HDAC1 also
up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of
YY1 in HEPG2 cells (Figure 6E and 6F, Supplementary
Figure 4). These data suggested that there was a reciprocal
regulation between YY1 and HDAC1.

Long-term survival of HCC patients is still very low
partly because of the high rate of intrahepatic invasion
and metastasis. Moreover, HCC is usually known as
a chemotherapeutic resistant tumor and patients with
HCC usually exhibited poor tolerance to conventional

chemotherapy due to the tumor heterogeneity and
liver dysfunction [17]. In view of the facts above,
new biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and treatment are
urgently needed. HDACi has been used to treat cancers
and exerted effective anti-tumor effects by modulating
multiple signaling pathways [18]. HDACi was also
reported to be a potential anti-HCC drug [19]. Although
HDACis are currently being tested in diverse clinical
trials for cancers, mechanisms underlining the efficacy
of HDACi and predictive biomarkers for HDACi are still
needed to be fully identified. In this study, we found that
the level of transcription factor YY1 was associated with
the sensitivity of HCC cells to HDACi. Further analysis
showed that YY1 expression was positively correlated
with HDAC1 in HCC cell lines and tumor tissues. These
data suggested that YY1 would be a potential biomarker
for HCC treatment with HDACi.

HDACi could induce cell cycle arrest,
antiproliferation and apoptosis of HCC cells. In this study,
we found that YY1 could attenuate the inhibitory effects
of HDACi on HCC tumorigenesis. Considering the fact
that YY1 was up-regulated in HCC tissues compared with
ANLTs, we supposed that YY1 might act as an oncogene
in HCC progression. Actually Tsang et al. have revealed
that YY1 could promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis
of HCC cells [16]. Our results also indicated that HDACi
decreased the expression of YY1 and YY1 would be a
potential treatment target for HCC patients.
YY1 binds to DNA strands by a sequence-specific
manner and plays important roles in development and
differentiation [20]. YY1 regulates a variety of cancerrelated genes including c-Myc, c-Fos and p53 [21–23].
C-terminal region of YY1 protein contains four C2H2
zinc fingers and is identified as one of the two repression

domains of YY1, while the other repression domain
located in the middle domain of YY1 protein [24]. The
N-terminal domain of YY1 contributed to the activation
of downstream genes [25]. Some reports have indicated
that YY1 was capable of both activating and repressing
gene transcription. For instance, YY1 could bind to the
promoter of FEN1 and suppress its expression [12].

Another study showed that YY1 protein interacted with
sequences of GR promoter and up-regulated its expression
[26]. In this study, our experiments showed that YY1
could bind to HDAC1 promoter and increase its mRNA
and protein levels. Until now, the specific mechanism
underlying the bi-functional roles of YY1 in gene
transcriptional regulation has not been fully determined.

HDACs are thought to bind to and deacetylate
histones, and usually inhibit gene transcription by
regulating chromosome condensation [27]. HDACs
could not bind to DNA sequences directly, but they could
interact with transcription factors which bind to the
promoters of target genes. Interestingly, it was reported
that YY1 could recruit HDACs on the promoter of target
genes and regulate gene transcription [21]. On the other
hand, Yao et al. reported that YY1 protein itself was
deacetylated by HDACs in its acetylated central region
and the acetylation of the central region was necessary for
the full transcription repressor activity of YY1 [28]. These
suggested that there was a complex relationship between
YY1 and HDACs. In this study, we found that YY1 could
directly bind to the promoter of HDAC1 and promoted its
expression, while overexpression of HDAC1 in turn upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of YY1. However,
the specific mechanism underlying the effects of HDAC1
on YY1 expression is still needed to be explored.
In conclusion, our studies showed for the first time
that YY1 was a potential biomarker for the sensitivity
of HCC cells to HDACi and attenuated the inhibitory
effects of HDACi on HCC tumorigenesis in vitro and
in vivo. We also indicated that YY1 was positively
correlated with HDAC1 in HCC cell lines and tumor
tissues, while there was a reciprocal regulation between
YY1 and HDAC1. Our study indicated potential roles of
YY1 and HDAC1 in the clinical diagnosis and treatment
of HCC patients.
