Abstract
Metabolic networks are highly connected and complex, but a single enzyme,
O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) can sense the availability of metabolites and also modify
target proteins. We show that inhibition of OGT activity inhibits the proliferation of
prostate cancer cells, leads to sustained loss of c-MYC and suppresses the expression of
CDK1, elevated expression of which predicts prostate cancer recurrence (p=0.00179).
Metabolic profiling revealed decreased glucose consumption and lactate production
after OGT inhibition. This decreased glycolytic activity specifically sensitized prostate
cancer cells, but not cells representing normal prostate epithelium, to inhibitors of
oxidative phosphorylation (rotenone and metformin). Intra-cellular alanine was
depleted upon OGT inhibitor treatment. OGT inhibitor increased the expression
and activity of alanine aminotransferase (GPT2), an enzyme that can be targeted
with a clinically approved drug, cycloserine. Simultaneous inhibition of OGT and
GPT2 inhibited cell viability and growth rate, and additionally activated a cell death
response. These combinatorial effects were predominantly seen in prostate cancer
cells, but not in a cell-line derived from normal prostate epithelium. Combinatorial
treatments were confirmed with two inhibitors against both OGT and GPT2. Taken
together, here we report the reprogramming of energy metabolism upon inhibition
of OGT activity, and identify synergistically lethal combinations that are prostate
cancer cell specific.

Introduction

activity promotes cell survival and proliferation by reprogramming tumour cell metabolism [1-3]. In addition,
AR re-wires the metabolism of the normal prostate tissue,
compared to the other differentiated cell and tissue types
in the human body. The prostate gland secretes high levels
of citrate, which is brought about by AR-regulated zinc
accumulation to inhibit cis-aconitase [1]. This leads to

Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer
in Europe and the USA. The androgen receptor (AR), a
member of the nuclear hormone receptor family, is the
major target in the treatment of the disease and its function
is therefore the major focus for research. Enhanced AR

decreased TCA cycle activity and ability to produce ATP.
In the normal prostate tissue, AR additionally promotes
the expression of lipogenic enzymes [4]. By doing this,
AR alters the key energy producing and consuming
mechanisms of the cell, and many of these changes are
typically associated with proliferating cells.
In prostate cancer, the major traits of the metabolic
phenotype are similar to what is seen in other cancers:
increased glycolysis, abnormal phospholipid metabolism
and dependence on reductive glucose metabolism [5]. It is
highly likely that some of the metabolic features initially
found in the normal prostate, are preserved in prostate
cancer, and can be successfully targeted by repurposing
metabolic inhibitors developed to treat other diseases.
Indications that this is feasible have arisen from large
epidemiological studies which, for example, have revealed
that the use of the anti-diabetic drug metformin has strong
effects on prostate cancer risk [6]. In addition, several
novel compounds targeting cancer-specific metabolic
abnormalities, such as glutaminase and monocarboxylate
transporter 1 inhibitors, are currently assessed in clinical
trials [7].
Metabolic pathways are highly inter-connected
which complicates drug approaches, as normal cells can
also be targeted. This challenge has led to the search for
combinatorial treatment options to specifically target
the vulnerabilities of cancer cells, which are not able to
activate appropriate survival pathways upon dual targeting
and do not cause toxicities in normal cells [8].
One of the key pathways sensing metabolic status
in cells is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP)
[9]. HBP requires glucose, glutamine, acetate and UTP,
and is thereby positioned to integrate information on
the availability of nutrients. HBP produces the highenergy compound UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDPGlcNAc), which is a sugar donor involved in synthesis
of other nucleotide sugars, complex glycosylation and
also utilized by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) to modify
target proteins via single sugar conjugation [10, 11]. OGT
targets key regulators of cell fate, including metabolic
enzymes such as phosphofructokinase 1 [12], epigenetic
regulators Oct4 and Sox2 [13] and transcriptional activity
through glycosylation of the RNA Polymerase II tail
to affect initiation complex formation [14]. Increased
OGT expression has been detected in numerous cancers,
including bladder cancer [15] and lung and colon cancers
[16]. We recently reported that HBP enzymes are overexpressed in human prostate cancer patients and that
three of the four HBP enzymes are induced by androgen
stimulation [2, 17]. All this has triggered great interest in
developing small molecule inhibitors to target OGT [18,
19].
Given the established metabolic re-programming
of prostate cancer cells, we hypothesised that inhibition
of OGT activity might be able to distort cancer cell
metabolism. In this study, we treated prostate cancer cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with a commercially available OGT inhibitor ST045849
and analysed samples with 1H Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Treatment with the OGT
inhibitor led to complete depletion of intracellular alanine.
Gene expression analysis suggested that alanine was
consumed by glutamic pyruvate transaminase 2 (alanine
aminotransferase, GPT2). Combining OGT inhibition with
GPT2 inhibition induced cell death specifically in prostate
cancer cells.

Results
Establishment of OGT inhibitor dose that inhibits
proliferation of cancer cells
OGT activity is important for the proliferation of
cancer cells, and inhibition of its activity inhibits tumour
formation and metastasis [17, 20, 21]. These effects
are mediated in part via down-regulation of oncogenic
transcription factors such as c-MYC (Figure 1A). Previous
studies have relied on transcriptomic profiling focusing on
regulators of cell cycle genes. Given the prominent role
of OGT as a metabolic integration point, we speculated
that inhibition of its activity might additionally alter the
metabolic profile of the cell.
First we wanted to identify an inhibitor dose that
would modestly inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer
cells but ideally have no or low effects in cells representing
normal prostate tissue. Therefore, we measured the
viability of LNCaP (a prostate cancer cell line) and of
PNT2 (a cell line representing normal prostate tissue) cells
after 96 hours of treatment. This time-point was selected
since prostate cancer cell proliferation rate is quite low
and the effects on the metabolome should become clearer
at late time-points. As expected, and based on previous
studies [17], OGT inhibitor ST045849 significantly
inhibited the viability of prostate cancer cells (Figure 1B).
The same compound also decreased the viability of PNT2
cells, but to lower extent. We next evaluated the growth
rate of both cell lines upon treatment with ST045849,
and found that the higher dose (40µM) led to complete
inhibition of proliferation in both prostate cancer cells and
in cells representing normal prostate tissue (Figure 1C).
Based on these data, we chose to treat cells with 20μM
ST045849 to study the metabolic response of cells to OGT
inhibition.
We next assessed if this dose was sufficient to
decrease total O-GlcNAcylation in cancer cells, but
observed that cells were able to compensate in the level
of total protein O-GlcNAcylation at late time-points (data
not shown), but at 1 hour after treatment with a low dose
of ST045849 (20µM), we observed prominent decrease
in the total protein O-GlcNAcylation (Suppl. Figure 1A).
The observed compensation is not surprising, as it is well

regulating O-GlcNAc cycling. GFPT1 (glutamine--fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the hexosamine
(HBP) biosynthetic pathway and directs glucose to the HBP rather than glycolysis. UDP-GlcNAc (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) is the
end-product of HBP and is utilized by OGT to modify target proteins via single sugar conjugation. c-MYC is highlighted here as one of
its targets. ST045849 is a small molecule inhibitor targeting OGT. OGA (N-Acetyl-Beta-D-Glucosaminidase) removes O-GlcNAc from
target proteins. B. LNCaP and PNT2 cells were treated with the indicated doses of OGT inhibitor ST045849 for 96 hours, and the viability

with Student’s t-test (* < 0.05, ** < 0.01 and *** < 0.001) by comparing untreated sample from the corresponding time point, and each

used to quantitate the intensity of each band, AR, c-MYC and CDK1 intensities were normalized to loading control and un-treated sample

established that O-GlcNAcylation is tightly regulated
[17, 22]. This compensation was mediated, at least in
part, through increased expression of the rate-limiting
enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, GFPT1
(Figure 1D and Suppl. Figure 1C, 1D). Interestingly, the
expression of both OGT and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) were
increased in the mRNA but not noticeably in protein
level upon OGT inhibitor treatment. We next assessed
whether some of the effects previously reported upon
treatment with ST045849 were seen at a dose of 20μM,
and observed that the compound led to sustained decrease
of c-MYC at the 24, 48 and 96 hour time-points (Figure
1E) [17]. In addition, we assessed the expression levels
of CDK1, the gene found to be most down-regulated by
ST045849 treatment [17]. The expression of CDK1 was
suppressed at 12 hours and this decreased expression
was maintained until 96 hours, and the same was true in
protein level (Figure 1D, 1E).
A novel OGT inhibitor, OSMI-1, was recently
reported with higher specificity against OGT than other
extant compounds [18, 19]. In an in vitro assay utilizing
purified OGT, OSMI-1 has a 20-fold lower IC50-value
once compared to ST045849. OSMI-1 has fewer side
effects, and compound appears not to affect plasmamembrane glycosylation, but still requires reasonably high
doses to induce effects on the total-O-GlcNAc (50µM for
maximal inhibition) [19]. We first confirmed that OSMI-1
decreased total-O-GlcNAc (Suppl. Figure 1E). Treatment
with OSMI-1 led maximally to 60% decrease in CDK1
mRNA (Suppl. Figure 1F). Importantly, and in agreement
with ST045849-data, OSMI-1 decreased both c-MYC
and CDK1 proteins by 40% at 24 and 48hours after the
treatment (Suppl. Figure 1G). CDK1 phosphorylates
AR and thereby stabilizes the protein and protein’s
transcriptional output [23]. As expected based on the
reported CDK1 function, OGT inhibition also decreased
AR protein expression (Figure 1E and Suppl. Figure 1G).
So far, we have established an inhibitor dose
that displayed a clear decrease in the expression of an
important cell cycle regulator, CDK1 [24], and a decrease
in the expression of AR, a major drug target in prostate
cancer. Analysis of a published prostate cancer microarray
data set [25] revealed that increased expression of CDK1
predicts prostate cancer recurrence after surgery with high
significance (p = 0.00179, Figure 1F). Based on these data,
we decided to analyse the possible metabolic adaptations
that enable prostate cancer cell survival despite the
significant down-regulation of prominent prostate cancer
oncogenes, c-MYC and AR.

prostate cancer cells treated with the OGT inhibitor.	
In accordance with growth inhibition, we observed a
decrease in glucose consumption and in lactate production,
potentially reflecting the inhibitory effects on cell growth
(Figure 2A). However, we speculated that the treatment
imposed a selection pressure on prostate cancer cells
for a switch in metabolic dependency. Since oxidative
phosphorylation can be sustained by other substrates
than glucose we hypothesised that the decreased ability
of these cells to cope with lower glucose uptake should
make them sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial
respiration. In order to test this hypothesis, we used two
compounds: (1) a highly potent mitochondria complex
1 inhibitor (rotenone) at a dose of 10nM which leads to
80% decrease in complex 1 activity [26] but has only
modest effect on viability, and (2) metformin (used at a
1mM concentration), another complex 1 inhibitor with less
specificity but used in clinical setting [27]. Treatment of
LNCaP cells with rotenone or metformin alone led to 20%40% decrease in cell viability, while combining either
of the compounds with the OGT inhibitor led to 80%
decrease in viability (Figure 2B). We also observed near
complete growth inhibition upon combinatorial treatment
(Figure 2C and 2D). Interestingly, while both rotenone and
metformin modestly decreased the viability and growth
rates of PNT2 cells, we did not observe any additive
effects with OGT inhibitor (Figure 2B-2D). These results
were confirmed with the novel OGT inhibitor OSMI1, and combinatorial treatments with either rotenone or
metformin statistically significantly decreased the viability
and blocked proliferation of prostate cancer cells but had
no effect on cells representing normal prostate tissue
(Suppl. Figure 2A-2C). In addition, treatment of another
prostate cancer cell line, PC3, with either of the OGT
inhibitors together with rotenone or metformin statistically
significantly reduced the viability of cells (Suppl. Figure
2D).
Extracellular metabolite concentrations can
reflect the energetic status of the cell, as shown here
by identifying potential combinatorial treatments to
inhibit proliferation. However, measuring intracellular
metabolites provides a more detailed picture of the cellular
metabolic networks.

Inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase activity leads
to depletion of intracellular alanine
Having established that glucose consumption is
significantly decreased in prostate cancer cells treated
with OGT inhibitor ST045849, we moved on to evaluate
the levels of intracellular metabolites. We noted prominent
accumulation of glucose and a decrease in intracellular
lactate concentration, in support of decreased glycolysis
(Figure 3A).
Interestingly, intra-cellular alanine was almost
completely depleted in LNCaP cells and glutamate was

decreased. Alanine and glutamate are inter-convertible,
non-essential amino acids. At the systemic level, alanine
is part of the alanine cycle, which transports carbon
skeletons between muscle cells and liver, to signal for
the need of increased glucose release [28]. Glutamic
pyruvate transaminase (GPT2, alternative name: alanine
aminotransferase) is the enzyme catalysing the metabolism
of alanine (and of α-ketoglutarate) to produce pyruvate and
glutamate (Figure 3B). Pyruvate can be utilized to support
the TCA cycle and ATP production. In this context, alanine
can be considered as an alternative energy source in the
absence of sufficient glycolysis. In support of this, GPT2
is induced by starvation (Suppl. Figure 3A and 3B).
OGT inhibition increased the expression of GPT2
already at 12 hours and increased expression was
maintained until 96 hours (Figure 3C). Interestingly, the
intracellular alanine level was decreased by 50% after 48
hours (Suppl. Figure 3C), and the amino acid was almost
completely consumed after 96 hours in LNCaP cells
(Figure 3A). mRNA and metabolomics data support the
hypothesis that GPT2 is activated in order to consume
alanine. We next used a GPT2 activity assay to confirm
that the enzyme activity is increased (Figure 3D). OGT
inhibition doubled GPT2 activity, when compared to the
untreated control.
Taken together, these results suggest that OGT
inhibition triggers cells to rely on alanine as an alternative
energy source and highlight an important role for the
GPT2 enzyme.

were combined (Figure 4C). However, combinatorial
treatment decreased the growth rate of PNT2 cells, albeit
to a lesser extent than LNCaP cells (Suppl. Figure 5A).
We hypothesised that a cell line derived from
normal prostate epithelium might be able to slow down
proliferation due to acute deficiency in energy production,
while a cell death response would be activated in prostate
cancer cells. This would explain the discrepancy observed
between the viability and the growth rate data. In order
to test this hypothesis, we applied our combinatorial
treatments to LNCaP and PNT2 cells and evaluated
caspase 3/7 activation in real-time. Interestingly, caspase
activation was prominently enhanced by the combinatorial
treatment with OGT inhibitors and GPT2 inhibitors in
LNCaP cells but not in PNT2 cells (Figure 5). Of high
importance, the clinically approved drug, cycloserine, was
more effective in activating the combinatorial cell death
response.

Discussion
In this study, we used ST045849, a commercially
available inhibitor, to study the effect of OGT inhibition
on prostate cancer cell viability and metabolic
reprogramming. We first established a compound dose
that significantly limited the proliferation of prostate
cancer cells (Figure 1B and 1C). We observed decrease
in the total-O-GlcNAc levels at 1 hour after the treatment
(Suppl. Figure 1A). However, total O-GlcNAc levels
varied from experiment-to-experiment over time points in
all conditions tested which may reflect the complex role
of the HBP as a sensor of changes and stresses across a
range of metabolic processes. Some of this may also at
the longer time points reflect an adaptation to maintain
the levels of total-O-GlcNAcylation, through increased
expression of GFPT1 (Figure 1D and Suppl. Figure 1C
and 1D).
Consequently, in order to understand the impact
of targeting OGT on cell growth we needed to look
beyond total O-GlcNAc levels and down to effects on
specific genes and proteins. We speculate that proteins
having only single or few sugar conjugations (such as
c-MYC [29]) will show regulatory response at low doses
of OGT inhibitor but this is not evident in the level of
total O-GlcNAc. OGT regulates target proteins according
to nutrient availability [10, 30]  and growth-promoting
factors need to be shut-down in the absence of nutrients
to avoid cell death. However, OGT additionally has
house-keeping target(s), amongst which nucleoporins
(NUPs) are highly abundant [31, 32]. Complete block
of OGT activity leads to decreased O-GlcNAcylation
and thereby ubiquitinylation and degradation of NUPs,
which compromises the nuclear pore selectivity filter [31].
Certain functions of OGT are important for the survival of
normal cells, and one option to position OGT as a drugtarget, is to use low dose of inhibitor and try to identify

Inhibition of alanine aminotransferase has
additive effect with OGT inhibitor
OGT inhibition led to a decrease in glucose
consumption and to a significantly higher alanine
consumption. In order to test whether GPT2 activity
is important for cell survival upon OGT inhibition, we
used two GPT2 inhibitors: chloro-alanine (Cl-alanine)
and cycloserine. Combination of either of the two OGT
inhibitors (ST045849 or OSMI-1) with either of the two
GPT2 inhibitors led to a statistically significant decrease
in the viability of LNCaP cells (Figure 4A). Both OGT
inhibitors sensitized another prostate cancer cell line,
VCaP, to cyclo-serine (Figure 4B). In addition, OGT
inhibition sensitized a third prostate cancer cell line (PC3)
to GPT2 inhibition Suppl. Figure 4A and 4B). We next
confirmed the small molecule data by inhibiting OGT
expression with siRNAs and treated cells with Cl-alanine
(Suppl. Figure 4C). This combinatorial treatment strategy
also completely blocked proliferation of LNCaP cells and
inhibited proliferation of PC3 cells (Suppl. Figure 5A-5C).
We next evaluated the combinatorial treatment
strategy of simultaneous targeting of OGT and GPT2
in PNT2 cells, and observed that both Cl-alanine and
cycloserine alone decreased cell viability, but no additive
effect was observed when both GPT2 and OGT inhibitors

cancer-cell specific vulnerabilities.
In this work, we observed that low dose of
ST045849 and OSMI-1 treatment was sufficient to
decrease the expression of AR, c-MYC and CDK1 (Figure
1D and 1E and Suppl. Figure 1F and 1G). Inhibition of
OGT expression has been shown to decrease the viability
and invasion of prostate cancer cells through reduction
of transcription factor FoxM1 [21]. Interestingly, CDK1
is required for FoxM1 transcriptional activity during cell

cycle progression [33, 34]. It appears that decrease OGT
activity can disrupt this positive cell cycle promoting
regulatory relationship in prostate cancer cells and it
remains to be determined if same is true in other cancers.
Increased CDK1 expression has not been correlated
with disease progression in prostate cancer, and we show
that its elevated expression increases the likelihood of
prostate cancer recurrence (Figure 1F). One of the major
functions of CDK1 is cell cycle regulation [24], while

combinatorial targeting of OGT and cancer-cell specific
metabolic abnormalities may allow significant dose
reduction. GPT2 functions to sustain pyruvate levels
and mitochondrial activity, which enables non-invasive
therapy monitoring using hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate
MRI. The next steps in taking OGT as a drug target into
the clinic requires utilization of model organisms to
better understand potential toxicities and the success of
combinatorial treatment regimes.

OGT itself directly acts on the key cell cycle regulators
such as HCF-1 [35] and DNA damage response proteins
[36]. OGT inhibition might sensitize cancer cells to
DNA damage inducing agents, and this approach clearly
demands further research.
We next performed metabolic profiling of prostate
cancer cells after OGT inhibitor treatment. Treatment
with ST045849 led to decreased glucose consumption
and lactate production (Figure 2A). This can, at least in
part, be explained through increased expression of GFPT1,
to divert glucose into hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
(Figure 1D). These data suggest that cancer cells decrease
glycolysis due to OGT inhibition, and might be sensitized
to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. We confirmed
this by treating cells with two different OGT inhibitors
(ST045849 and OSMI-1) and with two inhibitors of
oxidative phosphorylation, and observed cancer cell
specific growth blockage (Figure 2B- 2D and Suppl.
Figure 2).
We believe that small molecule inhibitors represent
the most effective therapeutic strategy to translate these
findings into the clinic, even though we did observe a clear
adaptation to the inhibitor treatment through increased
expression of GFPT1 (Figure 1D). However, some of the
desirable effects obtained through OGT inhibition, such
as decrease in c-MYC, AR and CDK1, were maintained
(Figure 1D and 1E).
OGT inhibition caused a near-to-complete depletion
of alanine in LNCaP cells (Figure 3A). Alanine is likely
consumed by GPT2 as an adaptation to OGT inhibition.
Interestingly, in the absence of any inhibitor, prostate
cancer cells accumulate alanine [37], and alanine level is
also increased in primary samples of prostate cancer [38].
Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
technology may allow non-invasive, real-time assessment
of alanine metabolism through hyperpolarized 13C labelled
pyruvate, which is converted to lactate and alanine in
prostate cancer[39].
GPT2 can be inhibited with small molecule
inhibitors Cl-alanine and cycloserine [40]. Cycloserine
is an FDA-approved drug to treat resistant forms of
tuberculosis[41], but the drug also inhibits human GPT2,
as shown previously [40] at similar doses as used in our
study. Combinatorial treatments strongly inhibited cell
viability and activated cell death response in prostate
cancer cells but not in cells representing normal prostate
tissue (Figure 4 and 5). Notably, GPT2 activity assays
have been developed and applied successfully to blood
samples [42].
In this work, we have defined complementary
inhibitor targets, oxidative phosphorylation and GPT2,
which can enhance response to OGT inhibition in prostate
cancer cells. FDA-approved drugs such as metformin
and cycloserine are available in clinical practice, thereby
offering accelerated translation of these findings. OGT
is also of high importance in normal cells [43], and

Materials and methods
Cell lines, maintenance and treatments
Cells were obtained from ATCC and were
maintained according to ATCC guidelines. For
metabolomic profiling, cells were plated into either
media with a commercial OGT inhibitor (ST045849,
TimTec) or a vehicle control (DMSO). O-(2-Acetamido2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidenamino) N-phenylcarbamate
(PUGNAc), metformin, rotenone, cycloserine and Clalanine were obtained from Sigma. OSMI-1 compound
was a gift from Professor Suzanne Walker (Harvard
Medical School). Cells were allowed to attach for 1 to
3 days, and then treated as indicated in the beginning of
the experiment (media was not changed at any point).
OGT knockdown was performed with Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX reagent according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen) and OGT targeting siRNAs were
obtained from Lifetechnologies (s16094 and s16095).

Analysis of viability, growth rate and GPT2- and
caspase-activity
Cells were plated into 384-well plates one day
before treatment, unless otherwise stated. Viability was
determined with cell titer glow (CTG) reagent (Promega).
Caspase activation (CellPlayer reagent) and growth
rates were determined with the IncuCyte instrument
(EssenBiosciences). For GPT2 assays, two million cells
were plated and activity was assessed with ALT Activity
Assay (Sigma).

Prepation of cell lysates
For NMR profiling, 350  000 cells were plated
into three 6-well plate wells, and combined for analysis.
Media was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored
in -80ºC until the analysis. Cells were collected into
ethanol (-20ºC). After this, cell lysates were centrifuged
(18 000rpm, 10 minutes), soluble material was transferred
to a new tube, evaporated with a speedvac and stored in
-80ºC until analysis. For mRNA profiling, mRNA was

We are grateful to Professor Suzanne Walker and
Dr. Craig Thomas, who provided us with access to a novel
OGT inhibitor (OSMI-1).

Preparation of cell lysates for western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared as described
previously[17] and cell lysis buffer was supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) and
PUGNAc. Membranes were probed with antibodies
against AR (SantaCruz N-20 sc-816), c-MYC (Abcam
ab32072), CDK1 (CST-9116), GFPT1 (CST-3818), OGT
(CST- 5368), OGA (Sigma HPA036141), α-Tubulin
(Millipore CP06) and GAPDH (CST-2118S).

NMR profiling
Cell extracts were dissolved in 600 µl PBS/D2O
solution containing 1.11 mM trimethylsilyl propionic
acid (TSP) as a chemical shift reference. 500 µl of culture
medium and blank culture medium samples (n = 2) were
mixed with 100 µl PBS/D2O/TSP solution. The samples
were transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes (Bruker Biospin
GmbH, Germany) for NMR analysis at the MR Core
Facility, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway, using a Bruker
Avance III Ultrashielded Plus 600 MHz spectrometer
(Bruker Biospin GmbH). The spectrometer was equipped
with a 5 mm QCI Cryoprobe. Proton spectra were
acquired using 1D NOESY (Bruker: noesygppr1d) with
presaturation and spoiler gradients as described previously
[44]. A standard 1 mM creatine reference solution was
analyzed under identical experimental conditions and
used as an external calibration standard. Pre-processing of
NOESY spectra was performed using TopSpin 3.2 (Bruker
BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). After 0.30 Hz
exponential line broadening and Fourier transformation,
spectra were automatically phase and baseline corrected.
The chemical shift was calibrated to the TSP peak at 0.0
ppm. Peak assignments were done according to human
metabolome database (HMDB; www.hmdb.ca), Chenomx
NMR Suite 7.0 (Chenomx Inc., Alberta, Canada) and
previously published data [45]. For cell extracts, the peak
areas of lactate (1.33 ppm), alanine (1.48 ppm), glutamate
(2.35 ppm) and glucose (4.64 ppm) and for culture
mediums, the peak areas of lactate (1.33 ppm) and glucose
(4.64 ppm) were identified and fitted as Voigt curves by
polynomial regression (PeakFit v 4.12; Systat Software
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The correlation coefficient of the
fit (r2) for all spectra was ≥0.95. Absolute concentration
of individual metabolites were calculated with reference
to peak area of the standard creatine solution and the cell
extract samples were normalized to the protein content
while culture medium samples were normalized to the
