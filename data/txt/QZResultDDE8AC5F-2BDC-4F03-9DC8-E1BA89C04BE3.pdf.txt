BACKGROUND: A prospective longitudinal study to profile patient-reported symptoms during radiotherapy (RT) or concurrent
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for head and neck cancer was performed. The goals were to understand the onset and trajectory of specific symptoms and their severity, identify clusters, and facilitate symptom interventions and clinical trial design. METHODS: Participants in this questionnaire-based study received RT or CCRT. They completed the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module before and weekly during treatment. Symptom scores were compared between treatment groups, and hierarchical cluster analysis was used to depict clustering of symptoms at treatment end. Variables believed to predict symptom severity were assessed using a multivariate mixed model. RESULTS: Among the 149 patients studied, the majority
(47%) had oropharyngeal tumors, and nearly one-half received CCRT. Overall symptom severity (P <.001) and symptom interference
(P <.0001) became progressively more severe and were more severe for those receiving CCRT. On multivariate analysis, baseline
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (P <.001) and receipt of CCRT (P <.04) correlated with higher symptom
severity. Fatigue, drowsiness, lack of appetite, problem with mouth/throat mucus, and problem tasting food were more severe for
those receiving CCRT. Both local and systemic symptom clusters were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this prospective
longitudinal study identified a pattern of local and systemic symptoms, symptom clusters, and symptom interference that was temporally distinct and marked by increased magnitude and a shift in individual symptom rank order during the treatment course. These
inform clinicians about symptom intervention needs, and are a benchmark for future symptom intervention clinical trials. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Radiotherapy (RT), an essential treatment of head and neck malignancies, is associated with a variety of acute and late toxicities and associated symptoms that affect various normal tissues and organ systems and interfere with patient activities
and functionality. Working groups have emphasized the importance of using patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures
rather than relying on physician ratings of toxicity in clinical effectiveness research.1,2 The use of patient symptom assessment tools has been recommended by the US National Institutes of Health for optimal patient care,3 and are more representative of symptom burden and therefore are now preferred over quality-of-life instruments.1 Comprehensive routine
symptom assessment and effective symptom management are particularly important during the course of RT, with or
without concurrent chemotherapy (chemoradiotherapy [CCRT]), for head and neck cancer. Unrecognized or uncontrolled symptoms lead to substantial distress and unnecessary suffering. Furthermore, a high symptom burden may lead to
poorer tolerance of therapy, unplanned treatment interruptions, or modification of the overall treatment schedule, which
may negatively affect oncologic outcomes and worsen prognosis.4

Certain acute symptoms resolve after therapy, others
may persist and become chronic (“consequential late
toxicity”), and yet other toxicity-associated symptoms
may emerge months or even years after recovery from
acute symptoms and are more prone to increase over
time.5 It is only within the last decade or so that the shift
toward greater primary RT-based treatment and now
commonplace CCRT has made us more acutely aware of
the potential toxicity costs to patients. However, to our
knowledge, the pattern of patient-reported local and systemic symptoms during the treatment of head and neck
cancer has not been fully detailed in a prospective longitudinal study.
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Symptom Inventory (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory) is a validated multisymptom assessment instrument
that evaluates patient symptoms commonly associated
with cancer and cancer therapy, and the interference with
activities of daily living. Because patients with head and
neck cancer have distinct disease site-related and
treatment-related symptoms, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)
was developed and validated to assess specific head and
neck symptoms,6 including those associated with mucositis, such as dry mouth, lack of appetite, pain, mouth/
throat sores, problem tasting food, problem with mouth/
throat mucus, and difficulty chewing/swallowing.7 The
MDASI-HN takes approximately 2 minutes to complete,
and affords clinicians brief, pertinent, and easily attainable
patient reported data to help guide patient-specific interventions, to monitor the success of interventions, and to
use in comparative outcomes research. We have previously described the symptom profile of patients with head
and neck cancer both before RT-based treatment has
begun8and toward the end of treatment7and modeled
patient group-based symptom severity differences and trajectories,9 but understanding the timing of onset and trajectory of the severity and resolution of specific symptoms
associated with RT or CCRT is necessary for developing
programmatic symptom prevention and intervention
strategies and for the rational design of symptom intervention clinical trials.
To address this need, the specific goals of the current
study using weekly symptom assessments were to 1) characterize the pattern of acute symptoms, both local and systemic, reported by patients with head and neck cancer
during RT or CCRT; 2) evaluate the symptom profiles
experienced by selected patient subgroups (RT or CCRT);
and 3) identify potential patient-, tumor-, and treatmentrelated factors associated with symptom severity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This single-institution, prospective, questionnaire-based
study was conducted after Institutional Review Board approval. Consecutive patients who were able to read and
understand English and were scheduled to undergo RT or
CCRT for head and neck cancer with curative intent were
recruited in our RT planning and quality assurance
clinic.10 All participants provided study-specific informed
consent and were enrolled before any radiation-based
treatment was initiated. Patient demographic and clinical
variables were collected. Patient performance status before
radiation-based treatment was rated by the treating radiation oncologist according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.11 Tumor and lymph node
classification was recorded according to the sixth edition
of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, published in 2002. Prior surgery and primary tumor
site were coded as described elsewhere.12 Exclusion criteria for this analysis were receipt of treatment with palliative intent, having distant metastatic disease, prior head
and neck RT, prior index cancer treatment outside the
study institution, and failure to complete at least 50% of
the cumulative MDASI-HN items across all planned survey time points.
The MDASI-HN Assessment Tool

The MDASI-HN is a psychometrically validated 28-item
questionnaire containing 13 “core” items representing important symptoms common to all cancer types, 9 “head
and neck cancer-specific” items, and 6 questions regarding
the extent to which the symptom complex interferes with
activities of daily life (“interference” items).6 The
MDASI-HN symptom items are rated on numeric scales
of 0 to 10 from “not present” to “as bad as you can imagine.” The 6 interference items are rated on numeric scales
of 0 to 10 from “did not interfere” to “interfered completely.” Participating patients self-administered and
completed the MDASI-HN questionnaires in hard copy
before the initiation of radiation-based therapy (week 0)
and then weekly during the 6-week to 7-week course of
RT or CCRT.
Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient and
clinical characteristics and MDASI-HN scores. The overall mean symptom severity and the mean values for each
MDASI-HN item over the 6-week to 7-week treatment
course were plotted for each treatment group (RT vs
CCRT). To assist with the clinical interpretation of these

data, the percentage of patients with moderate to severe
(ratings of  5 on the scale of 0-10) and severe (ratings
of  7) levels of the most common symptoms identified
were also calculated, as were symptoms experienced at
moderate to severe levels by at least 15% of patients at the
end of treatment. Hierarchical cluster analysis of symptoms at the end of therapy was used to provide a pictorial
representation of how symptoms clustered at that time.
Group mean differences were compared with independent Student t tests. All reported P values are 2-tailed and
considered significant if < .05, unless otherwise noted
when Bonferroni corrections were used.
Correlates of higher symptom severity were based on
the arithmetic average of the symptom items. Covariates
that could influence symptom severity were prespecified
and included sex, age, primary tumor site, T classification,
N classification, receipt of previous treatment (surgery or
chemotherapy), receipt of CCRT (vs RT), RT technique
(3-dimensional conformal RT or intensity-modulated RT
[IMRT]), and baseline (pretreatment) ECOG performance status. We first fitted linear mixed models with only
time and a covariate at a time as fixed effects and patients
as random effects to determine the independent effect of a
covariate on the overall mean symptom severity. Covariates that were significant at a P value < .05 were entered as
main effects in a multivariate mixed model that allowed
us to examine the effect of the predictor variables simultaneously. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software (version 21.0; IBM, Armonk, NY).

RESULTS
Patients, Tumors, and Previous Treatment

Of the 161 patients enrolled in this longitudinal study
from March 2006 to August 2007, 149 met the current
criteria for analysis (77 treated with RT and 72 treated
with CRT). The reasons for exclusion were prior RT to
the head and neck (8 patients), treatment with palliative
intent (3 patients), and receipt of prior outside treatment
with limited medical records available (1 patient). Patient,
tumor, and treatment characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median patient age was 59 years (standard deviation, 11.06 years). The majority of tumors (116 tumors)
were of squamous histology. Thirty-eight patients
received induction chemotherapy; the most common regimens were docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (15
patients) and a platinum-taxane doublet (15 patients).
Seventy-two patients received CCRT; the most common
systemic agent was cisplatin (38 patients), followed by
cetuximab (16 patients), multiagent regimens (11

patients), and carboplatin (6 patients). The majority of
the patients (92%) were treated with IMRT; the median
radiation dose was 66 gray (Gy) (range, 56 Gy-72 Gy),
delivered in a median of 30 fractions (range, 23 fractions42 fractions) over a median of 41 days (range, 21 days-52
days). The majority of patients (87%) were treated with
standard-fractionation RT schedules.
Pattern of Symptom Burden During Therapy

With regard to assessment compliance, the average
MDASI-HN completion rate was 97% in weeks 1 to 2,
96% in weeks 3 to 4, and 87% in weeks 5 to 6. The mean
MDASI-HN item ratings by treatment period and treatment group are depicted in Figure 1 and Table 2. Overall,
the symptom rank order, in terms of symptom severity,
shifted during the treatment course; the 10 symptoms
rated as most severe (in order of decreasing mean severity)
during weeks 1 to 2 of therapy were fatigue, dry mouth,
drowsiness, problem tasting food, lack of appetite, disturbed sleep, distress, problem with mouth/throat mucus,
pain, and problem swallowing/chewing; for weeks 6 to 7,
the order was problem tasting food, problem with mouth/
throat mucus, difficulty swallowing/chewing, fatigue, dry
mouth, lack of appetite, mouth/throat sores, pain, skin
pain/burning/rash, and drowsiness.
Mean weekly severity scores for all 22 symptom
items were 0.9 for baseline (pretreatment), 1.2 for week 1,
1.7 for week 2, 2.5 for week 3, 2.8 for week 4, 3.2 for
week 5, and 3.4 for week 6 or 7; the corresponding mean
weekly overall symptom interference scores were 1.5 (baseline), 1.5, 1.8, 2.4, 2.8, 2.9, and 3.4, respectively. Mixed
model results demonstrated that overall symptom severity
(P < .001) and symptom interference (P < .001) both
became progressively worse over the course of treatment.
The percentages of patients experiencing moderate to
severe levels and severe levels of the 13 most prominent
symptoms in each treatment period are shown in Figure 2.
Results from symptom cluster analyses at the end of
treatment are shown in Figure 3. The majority of the top
symptoms clustered into 1 of 2 distinct symptom groups:
the local symptom cluster (eg, dry mouth, problem with
mouth/throat mucus, difficulty chewing/swallowing,
mouth/throat sores, and problem tasting food) and systemic symptom cluster (eg, pain, fatigue, drowsiness, and
lack of appetite).
With regard to differences by treatment group, the
overall mean symptom severity was worse for those receiving CCRT than for those receiving RT alone (2.9 vs 1.8;
P < .001) (Fig. 4). The trajectories and comparisons for
individual mean symptoms and overall symptom

Correlates of Symptom Severity

On univariate analysis, mixed model results demonstrated that receipt of CCRT (P < .006), T classification (P < .03), and ECOG performance status
(P < .001) were significant correlates of symptom severity over time, whereas sex (P < .37), age (P < .47),
primary tumor site (P < .09), previous treatment
(P < .23), N classification (P < .77), and RT technique (P < .60) were not. On multivariate analysis,
ECOG performance status and CCRT were the only
significant correlates of symptom severity; higher
mean symptom scores were reported for patients with
poorer ECOG performance status (2.4 vs 2.1;
P < .001) and those receiving CCRT rather than RT
(2.5 vs 2.1; P < .04). Although symptom severity and
group differences by T classification were similar in
magnitude (2.4 vs 2.1; P < .20), the difference was
not found to be statistically significant on multivariate
analysis.

DISCUSSION
The current prospective longitudinal study uses a validated PRO instrument (MDASI-HN) to identify specific symptoms and their trajectory during RT, with or
without concurrent chemotherapy, for patients with
head and neck cancer. The majority of patients report
relatively low tumor-associated symptom distress before
treatment,8 but the results of the current study indicate
that for 7 of the 22 MDASI-HN individual symptom
items,  50% of patients reported moderate to severe
treatment-associated distress at some time during the
treatment course (Fig. 2, Top). The specific time of
symptom onset and their trajectories inform us about
the required optimal timing for specific symptom
interventions and patient education and preparedness.
Unfortunately, reliable, effective, and validated specific
interventions for many of these symptoms are not yet
available. Nevertheless, the results of the current study
provide benchmark data for power and sample size

estimates for future clinical trials involving symptom
interventions.
Although we have previously modeled patient
group-based symptom severity differences and trajectories,9 the current study further builds on those results in
that it details the kinetic profile, including the relative
emergence and incremental increase in magnitude, for
individual local and systemic symptoms and symptom interference, and identifies unique symptoms clusters during RT for head and neck cancer. The most prominent
local symptoms clustered: dry mouth, problem with
mouth/throat mucus, mouth/throat sores, and difficulty
chewing/swallowing. Systemic or global symptoms also
formed distinct clusters, and the most prominent of these
were fatigue, distress, disturbed sleep, and drowsiness.
Relationally, these systemic symptom clusters may be
attributed to local cytokine release and the systemic and
inflammatory effects of cancer therapy,12 as previously
demonstrated in other disease sites,13,14 which may serve
as target for future symptom prevention and intervention
studies.
With regard to the impact of treatment group on
symptom burden, chemotherapy concurrent with RT was

found to significantly increase symptom severity.
Although this was expected and well known in global
terms,12 we believe the results of the current study provide
granular detail. It is interesting to note for example that
although mouth and throat sores were substantially more
severe in the CCRT group, the pain curves for RT and
CCRT tracked relatively more closely. The greatest differences in symptom severity between those receiving CCRT
versus those treated with RT (Fig. 3) were first observed
early in the treatment course (weeks 1 and 2) and then
again, and much more pronounced, toward the end of
treatment (weeks 5 and 6), whereas symptom severity
overlapped between the 2 groups in the middle of therapy
(weeks 3 and 4). Furthermore, CCRT was associated with
significantly increased overall symptom interference and
specific interference subscales, and it significantly influenced both the severity and rank order of a subset of both
local and systemic individual symptoms (ie, fatigue,
drowsiness, lack of appetite, problem with mouth/throat
mucus, and problem tasting food). We are currently performing studies to evaluate the drivers of interference.
Beyond statistical comparisons, the shapes and trajectories of the overall symptom severity and individual
symptom curves help to illustrate symptom differentials
between treatment groups. For some symptoms, such as
problem with taste, mouth/throat sores, and fatigue, the
overall shape of the curves between treatment groups was
quite similar, but the curves maintained separation with a
higher severity of symptoms associated with CCRT.
Others, such as dry mouth and problem with mouth/
throat mucus, initially tracked and then diverged in the
middle of treatment, whereas symptoms such as difficulty
with voice/speech, skin pain/burning/rash, and choking
tracked closely without separation. Despite these differing
patterns in symptom variation between the RT and
CCRT groups, the shape and trajectory of the corresponding interference curves separated at the onset, and
remained so throughout treatment.
In terms of the clinical application of the MDASIHN and the results of the current study, we believe that
weekly sampling, although subject to potential concerns
associated with response shift,15 nonetheless promotes
improved treatment compliance and reveals the progressive nature of individual acute symptoms in a manner that
allows both prophylactic and reactive interventions to be
timed effectively, in a way that maximizes clinic staff allocation (eg, opportunity for treatment group-specific and/
or algorithm-based patient care pathways) and allows
patients and caregivers to be given reliable information on
the pattern of symptoms to be expected. For example, cerCancer

tain symptoms such as dry mouth, decreased appetite, and
problem tasting food appeared early and steadily rose in
severity across the treatment course, and as such these
symptoms might be emphasized before therapy is begun.
Conversely, other common symptoms such as mouth and
throat sores and problems swallowing/chewing appeared
more abruptly near the midpoint of therapy, with a subsequent rapid rise followed by a relative plateau in severity
toward the end of the study period. Although patients are
also informed of these before treatment, they may benefit
from reemphasis in the middle of treatment. The increase
in problems with choking in both groups underscores the
importance of clinical swallowing evaluations, swallowing
exercises, and maneuvers by speech language pathologists
experienced in swallowing therapy, particularly for
patients receiving CCRT. Beyond its role as a PRO
instrument in multiple ongoing clinical protocols, we are
currently using the MDASI-HN as part of our routine
patient evaluation and as a management tool before, during, and after therapy.
Although these data were prospectively collected,
the sampling limitations inherent in a single-institution
series (in this case, a tertiary care specialty hospital) may
affect the generalizability of the results. However, the population in the current study did reflect recent epidemiologic trends in head and neck cancer in that the majority
of the patients were aged < 60 years, male, and had primary oropharyngeal cancer. Notably, one would expect
many of the tested variables to be correlated with each
other. For example, as is true in our recent practice patterns, the majority of patients with advanced lymph node
disease received induction chemotherapy, most patients
with oropharyngeal disease were treated with CCRT (Table 1), and nearly all patients were treated with IMRT
rather than 3-dimensional conformal RT and standard
fractionation radiation schedules were most commonly
used. Furthermore, because we excluded patients who
were being treated with palliative intent, the majority of
the patients in the current study had good ECOG performance status before therapy began. Addressing these
limitations will require additional longitudinal studies
incorporating additional clinical variables (such as tumor
human papillomavirus status, dosimetric details of RT,
treatment compliance, and objective functional measures)
to identify symptom kinetics across a wider array of
patients with head and neck cancer, treatment modalities,
management paradigms, and practice settings.
To our knowledge, the current series represents the
first report of an individual symptom trajectory with
symptom interference and cluster analyses based on a
1983

validated symptom burden PRO measure, and with high
temporal granularity. Many of the studied symptoms do
not have current effective, reliable, or validated specific
prevention or direct treatment options. Consequently, on
the basis of these results, we are conducting multiple prospective randomized clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic interventions that target purported candidate
symptom mechanisms and expression pathways. We are
also conducting additional longitudinal analyses to detail
the symptom burden after the completion of RT or
CCRT so that we can evaluate the influence of these acute
symptoms on subsequent late symptom trajectory, recovery, and persistence into long-term survivorship. Additional robust symptom-related data are also necessary for
statistical assumptions in future head and neck cancer trials in which symptom distress is an endpoint. This is particularly relevant because recent investigational treatment
strategies undertaken by clinical trial cooperative groups
have focused on treatment “deintensification” for selected
patients (namely those with human papillomavirusassociated oropharyngeal cancer), with the goals of maintaining or improving established cure rates but reducing
treatment-related toxicity and patient symptoms through
the added evaluation of transoral robotic surgery
(ECOG Trial 3311 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01898494]) and comparison of concurrent systemic
therapy agents used in definitive chemoradiation strategies (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Trial 1016
[ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01302834]).
The majority of patients in the current study experienced high symptom severity and symptom burden with a
combination of problematic local and systemic symptom
constellations. The pattern of symptoms and the degree of
symptom interference was temporally distinct, being
marked by an increased magnitude and a shift in individual symptom severity rank order over time, and with identifiable clusters of symptom subsets (both local and
systemic). These findings will facilitate the rational development of symptom and specifically symptom clusterbased interventions and prevention strategies and help
direct the importance of their relative timing. They further provide a reference data set for study design and statistical assumptions to be used in ongoing prospective
clinical trials involving symptom intervention or reduction. Because to the best of our knowledge few reliable
interventions have been identified for many of the most
problematic local and systemic symptoms to date, additional research investigating symptom development or

1984

expression mechanisms and accompanying targeted
symptom reduction strategies are urgently needed.
