BACKGROUND. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality
among men in the U.S. To the authors’ knowledge, there is no proven, effective,
second-line therapy for docetaxel-refractory disease. Recent data suggest that
platinum salts may be effective when combined with taxanes in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The authors conducted a phase 2 trial
of docetaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy in this disease setting.

METHODS. Eligible men had metastatic HRPC that had progressed during or
within 45 days after the completion of docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Patients
were treated with intravenous docetaxel at a dose of 60 mg/m2 plus carboplatin
at an area under the curve of 4 once every 21 days until they had either disease
progression or unacceptable toxicity.

overall survival was 12.4 months. Patients were more likely to respond to the
combination if they previously had responded to docetaxel.
CONCLUSIONS. In men with HRPC who developed progressive disease during or
shortly after treatment with docetaxel, the addition of carboplatin resulted in
modest additional activity. Taxane-refractory HRPC is an area of unmet need,
and the current trial has provided evidence that platinum chemotherapy may be
an important therapeutic option. Cancer 2008;112:521–6.  2007 American

P

rostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality
among men in the U.S.1 Nearly all deaths are caused by metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). It is well established that the first-line treatment for HRPC is docetaxel (Taxotere;
Sanofi-Aventis) combined with prednisone.2,3 For men who have
docetaxel-refractory disease, currently, there is no proven, effective,
second-line therapy.
Although it has been believed historically that the platinum salts
have little activity in HRPC, recent data suggest that they can be
effective when combined with taxanes.4 Several trials of carboplatin
(Paraplatin; Bristol-Meyers Squibb) in combination with taxanes and
estramustine as first-line treatment for HRPC have demonstrated

both a high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response
rate (RR) and a high measurable RR (with a measurable RR between 25% and 60%).5,6 Measurable
responses to taxane therapy alone or combined with
estramustine are rare (10%–20%), suggesting an additive effect for the addition of carboplatin.
Given the lack of effective therapies for docetaxelrefractory HRPC and clinical data suggesting that taxanes plus carboplatin may provide additive benefit,
we performed a single-arm, phase 2 trial of docetaxel
plus carboplatin chemotherapy in men with HRPC
who had previously progressed while receiving docetaxel therapy. Because there are expanding data
regarding the neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate
cancer and its correlation with sensitivity to platinum
salts, chromogranin A (CgA), and neuron-specific
enolase (NSE), we examined the correlation between
these circulating markers and the efficacy of therapy.7

MATERIALS AND METHODS

complete blood count, liver function tests, serum
chemistries, and tests to determine levels of PSA,
CgA, and NSE. Circulating levels CgA and NSE were
determined by using enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay kits from DRG International (Mountainside, NJ). Chest, abdomen, and pelvic computed
tomography (CT) scans and bone scans were
obtained at baseline and after every 3 cycles.
Patients received both docetaxel and carboplatin
on Day 1 of every cycle. Docetaxel was given first at
a dose of 60 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour followed by carboplatin, which was calculated at a dose
to achieve a target area under the curve of 4 by using
the Calvert formula, again, over 1 hour.8 Standard
dexamethasone premedication was used, and androgen-deprivation therapy was maintained throughout
the trial. Treatment was continued until patients
developed either progressive disease or evidence of
unacceptable toxicity.

Patients
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with radiographic evidence
of metastatic disease, disease progression during primary androgen-deprivation therapy, and docetaxelrefractory disease. We defined docetaxel-refractory
disease as disease progression (radiographically and/
or PSA) documented either during treatment or
within 45 days after the cessation of treatment with
docetaxel. Patients must have received at least 2
cycles of docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Other entry
criteria included a Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status of 0, 1, or 2; a serum testosterone
level <50 ng/mL (unless surgically castrate); no use of
an antiandrogen for at least 4 weeks; and adequate
bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. Patients
were excluded if they had significant peripheral neuropathy or had received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. At least 4 weeks must have passed since
patients completed external-beam radiation therapy,
and 8 weeks must have passed since patients completed radiopharmaceutical therapy.
All patients provided written informed consent.
The study was approved by each institutional review
board in accordance with international standards of
good clinical practice. Patients were enrolled from 2
sites: Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center and Oregon Health and Science University.

Outcomes
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the
safety and activity of docetaxel plus carboplatin
chemotherapy in this patient population. Activity was
measured by both PSA declines and measurable RR.
Measurable disease was evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.9 At
least 2 new lesions on a bone scan were required to
diagnose progressive disease based on nontarget
lesions. Moreover, 2 new lesions on a bone scan
were allowed if it was believed that, clinically, they
represented a ‘‘tumor flare’’ during treatment in the
setting of a patient who otherwise was displaying evidence of response to therapy. PSA response was evaluated according to the PSA Working Group criteria.10
Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated as
the time from registration to the time of either disease progression (PSA progression or radiographic
progression, whichever came first) or death. The
remaining patients who did not experience progression or death were censored at the date they last
were known alive if the patient was off study or the
date of the last disease evaluation if the patient still
was on study. Overall survival (OS) was defined as
the time from registration to death. Survival was censored at the date last known alive if a patient was off
study or the date of last disease evaluation if the
patient still was on study (2 patients).

Procedures and Treatment
A cycle on this trial was 21 days in length. At baseline and at the beginning of every cycle, patients
underwent a history and physical examination, evaluation of performance status, blood tests for a

interim overall objective response. The first stage
ended when 15 eligible patients were accrued. The
stopping rule established that, if 1 response was
observed among the first 15 eligible patients, then
the study would stop. If 2 responses were observed
in the first 15 eligible patients, then an additional 16
patients would be accrued. If 6 overall responses
were observed, then the regimen would be considered promising (90% exact binomial confidence
interval [90% CI], 9.1–35.7%).
All treated patients were included in the toxicity
analysis. Assuming that all 34 patients received treatment, the exact binomial 90% CI on the rate of
severe toxicities would be no wider than 31%. The
probability of observing at least 1 grade 4 or greater
toxicity was 83% if the true rate of grade 4 or higher
toxicities was 5%.
OS and PFS distributions were estimated by
using the Kaplan-Meier method.11 The Wilcoxon

rank-sum test was used to evaluate the association
of baseline CgA and NSE and response.12

RESULTS
This trial was activated in January 2004 and closed to
accrual April 2006 after reaching target accrual. A
planned interim analysis occurred in June 2005.

Characteristics of Patients and Treatment
In total, 34 patients were accrued and treated. One
patient was deemed ineligible based on an inability
to confirm his prostate cancer histologically; however, given the clinical circumstance (elevated and
rising PSA, bone metastases), he was treated on
study, and his data are included. Table 1 summarizes
baseline patient characteristics. Twenty-one patients
(62%) had measurable disease at baseline. All
patients had received androgen-deprivation therapy,
and nearly all had received secondary hormone treatments, including antiandrogens (88%), steroids
(59%), and ketoconazole (52%). All patients had
received prior docetaxel chemotherapy either alone
(47%) or in combination with other chemotherapy
(53%). Moreover, 41% of patients had received nondocetaxel chemotherapy. Sixty-one percent of
patients had received more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen.
Table 2 summarizes the number of cycles of protocol therapy received and the reason for treatment
termination. The median total number of cycles on
treatment overall was 4 cycles (range, 1–12 cycles).
Most patients terminated treatment because of progressive disease.
Activity and Survival
In an intention-to-treat analysis, among all 34
patients, 6 patients (18%; 95% CI, 7–35%) achieved a
partial response according to PSA criteria (defined as

a confirmed decrease 50% in serum PSA). The median duration of PSA response was 5.7 months. Ten
patients had stable disease as their best response; of
these, 3 patients (9%) had stable disease that lasted
3 months. Among the 21 patients who had measurable disease at baseline, 3 patients (14%; 95% CI, 3–
36%) achieved a partial response according to radiographic criteria. Two of those 3 patients had lymph
nodes as their only site of measurable disease. No
complete, measurable responses were observed.
Patients who had a drop 50% in serum PSA in
response to their previous docetaxel treatment were
more likely to respond to treatment with docetaxel
plus carboplatin, although this difference was not
statistically significant, and responses also were
observed among patients who were refractory to docetaxel (PSA RR, 23.5% vs 11.8%, respectively; P 5 .66).
All 34 patients were included in the analysis of
PFS. Twenty-seven of 34 patients (79%) were counted
as events in the dataset analysis as of November
2006. The median PFS was 3 months (95% CI, 2.1–
5.5 months) (Fig. 1). At the time of last follow-up, 13
of 34 patients (38%) had died with a median OS of
12.4 months (95% CI, 7–17 months) (Fig. 2).

Toxicity
The combined chemotherapy was tolerated reasonably well in this patient population. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity was bone marrow
suppression, which primarily was grade 3 leukopenia
(experienced by 56% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 7 patients (21%). Only 1 episode
of febrile neutropenia was observed. Table 3 reviews
toxicity. One episode of grade 5 nonhematologic toxicity was observed that reportedly was not related to
chemotherapy (cardiac ischemia). No grade 4 nonhematologic toxicities were reported. It is noteworthy
that, whereas only 12% of patients discontinued
treatment because of toxicity, another 17% discontin-

Serum samples (n 5 172) were obtained during treatment from 33 of 34 patients. There were 2 patients
and 4 patients missing baseline CgA and NSE data,
respectively. Furthermore, there were 8 patients and
11 patients were missing Cycle 3 CgA and NSE data,
respectively. Although there was a trend toward
improved PSA RR in patients with a lower baseline
CgA level (median CgA level, 4.4 pmol/mL in responders vs 8.8 pmol/mL in nonresponders), this difference did not reach statistical significance (P 5 .07).

patients were on trial with any efficacy endpoints
(PSA RR, time to progression, or survival).

DISCUSSION
Despite the approval of docetaxel-based chemotherapy for patients with HRPC, there remains a clear
need for new therapies in docetaxel-refractory
patients. To our knowledge, very few trials have been
reported to date targeting this patient population (see
Table 4). Although it has only moderate activity as a
single agent in HRPC, there is evidence from phase 2
trials that carboplatin provides additive effect when
combined with taxanes in a chemotherapy-naive
HRPC population.5,6 Moreover, a recent report that
single-agent satraplatin (GPC Biotech) improves PFS
as second-line chemotherapy for patients with HRPC
provides further evidence that platinum salts may
have a role in the treatment of HRPC.13
In the current trial, the addition of carboplatin to
men whose disease was progressing during docetaxel
treatment was tolerated reasonably well. The most
common toxicity was leukopenia, but febrile neutropenia was rare. Cumulative fatigue did result in multiple withdrawn consents. Moreover, the efficacy of this
treatment, although it was modest, compares favorably to other trials performed in this patient population (Table 4). Circulating levels of NSE and CgA, both
at baseline and after treatment, were uninformative.
This trial was small, however, and, with only an 18%
RR, had limited power to examine such biomarkers.
The current trial had limitations. We chose to
combine carboplatin with docetaxel despite the finding that these patients already had developed disease
progression during docetaxel treatment. The rationale for this design was that most of the data for the

use of carboplatin were in combination with taxane
chemotherapy, with a suggestion that the 2 drugs together may act synergistically. This trial could not
determine whether both agents are needed together
to achieve this efficacy. Although it appears unlikely
that docetaxel alone would provide any benefit in
patients who have just progressed while receiving
docetaxel, it is possible that carboplatin alone may
be sufficient to achieve these results. Although to our
knowledge there are no data in the docetaxel-refractory setting, 5 studies have administered single-agent
carboplatin in patients with HRPC and produced
PSA RRs and measurable RRs between 6% and
30%.14–18 It may be expected that this PSA RR would
decline significantly in the postdocetaxel setting;
however, the possibility that carboplatin alone may
have resulted in similar efficacy outcomes to the
those described here cannot be excluded.
In conclusion, in men with HRPC whose disease
was progressing during or shortly after treatment
with docetaxel, the addition of carboplatin resulted
in modest activity, with PSA declines 50% in 18% of
patients, a PFS of 3 months, and a median response
duration of 5.7 months. Therapy was tolerated well.
Docetaxel-refractory HRPC is an area of unmet medical need, and the current trial provides further evidence that platinum chemotherapy may be an
important therapeutic option for such patients. Further research is needed both to investigate the role
of continuing taxanes in the second-line setting and
to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from platinum chemotherapy.
