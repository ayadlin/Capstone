ABSTRACT
Bortezomib (Velcal) was the first proteasome inhibitor to be approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with relapsed/refractory multiple
myelomas. Previous studies have demonstrated that bortezomib inhibits tumor cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis by blocking the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway.
However, the exact mechanism by which bortezomib induces cancer cell apoptosis is
still not well understood. In this study, we found that bortezomib significantly inhibited
cell proliferation in both human Burkitt’s lymphoma CA46 and Daudi cells. Through
proteomic analysis, we found that bortezomib treatment changed the expression
of various proteins in distinct functional categories including unfolding protein
response (UPS), RNA processing, protein targeting and biosynthesis, apoptosis, and
signal transduction. Among the proteins with altered expression, hnRNP K, hnRNP H,
Hsp90α, Grp78, and Hsp7C were common to both Daudi and CA46 cells. Interestingly,
bortezomib treatment downregulated the expression of high-molecular-weight
(HMw) hnRNP K and c-Myc but upregulated the expression of low-molecular-weight
(LMw) hnRNP K. Moreover, cell proliferation was significantly correlated with high
expression of HMw hnRNP K and c-Myc. HMw and LMw hnRNP K were identified as
sumoylated and desumoylated hnRNP K, respectively. Using transient transfection,
we found that sumoylated hnRNP K increased c-Myc expression at the translational
level and contributed to cell proliferation, and that Lys422 of hnRNP K is the candidate
sumoylated residue. Our results suggest that besides inhibiting the ubiquitinproteasome pathway, bortezomib may inhibit cell proliferation by downregulating
sumoylated hnRNP K and c-Myc expression in Burkitt’s lymphoma cells.

INTRODUCTION

by various modifications including phosphorylation
[20–22], methylation [23], ubiquitination [24], and
sumoylation [25, 26]. Increased levels of hnRNP K are
correlated with cancer cell proliferation and metastasis,
and are implicated in the regulation of oncogene c-Myc
transcription [27] and translation [28], as well as
oncogene c-Src transcription [20].
Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) comprise
a small protein family that contains at least four isoforms
including SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, and SUMO-4.
SUMOs can covalently bind to lysine residues of
proteins such as p53, IκB, PML, and c-Jun, affecting
their subcellular localization, transcriptional activity,
and protein stability [29]. Sumoylation can be reversed
by sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) that
remove SUMO molecules from sumoylated proteins
[30]. Recent reports have indicated that sumoylation
regulates tumorigenesis. Ubc9, a SUMO-conjugating
enzyme, is overexpressed in ovarian cancer [31],
and sumoylated reptin increases metastatic potential
by repressing the metastasis-suppressor gene KAI1
[32]. Sumoylated interferon regulatory factor
(IRF)-1 competes with non-sumoylated IRF-1 to inhibit
cytokine-mediated apoptosis, which results in tumor cell
proliferation [33].
Both hnRNP K and sumoylation have been shown to
play roles in the tumorigenesis; however, whether there is
a link between hnRNP K and sumoylation, and Burkitt’s
lymphoma, is not clear till date. In this study, we examined
the influence of bortezomib on protein expression in
Burkitt’s lymphoma cells, and the relationship between
inhibition of proliferation and downregulation of
sumoylated hnRNP K by bortezomib.

Burkitt’s lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell type of
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [1]. Burkitt’s lymphoma occurs
endemically in areas with malaria exposure [2] and is
associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections [3].
Most Burkitt’s lymphomas overexpress the Myc oncogene
that promotes cell cycle progression and contributes to
tumor formation [4]. Overexpression of Myc mostly results
from its translocation to an immunoglobulin gene, such as
the t (8;14) (q24;q32) translocation found in approximately
85% of Burkitt’s lymphomas cases. Chemotherapeutic
regimens can produce good prognoses for patients with
Burkitt’s lymphoma [5]. High doses of methotrexate,
cytosine arabinoside, and cyclophosphamide, whether or
not in combination with a specific antibody (e.g., rituximab)
[6], are useful chemotherapeutic drugs.
Proteasomes are multi-protein complexes
and are responsible for ubiquitin-mediated protein
degradation [7]. Dysregulation of proteasome activity
may increase endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress, which
ultimately results in apoptosis [8] and contributes to
several diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s
diseases [9, 10]. Inhibition of proteasome activity
has been developed as a new strategy to induce tumor
cell apoptosis [11]. Bortezomib, a dipeptidyl boronic
acid proteasome inhibitor, was the first proteasome
inhibitor to be approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 2003 for treating multiple
myelomas and mantle cell lymphomas [12]. Besides
inhibition of proteasome activity, bortezomib can also
induce apoptosis by interrupting the DNA repair and
unfolded protein response pathways, and by inhibiting
proliferation and survival signal molecules such as
PI3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and
nuclear factor (NF)-kB [13]. Bortezomib activates the
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal pathway and
increases caspase-3 and caspase-8 levels in multiple
myelomas [14]. In human pancreatic cancer cells,
bortezomib induces apoptosis by inhibiting the PKR-like
endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and increasing
ER stress [15]. Additionally, bortezomib can induce
apoptosis in cancer cells by increasing the release of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytochrome C from
mitochondria, as well as by activating caspase-3 and
caspase-9 [13, 16].
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K
(hnRNP K) is located mainly in the nucleus [17],
where it regulates DNA repair, transcription, chromatin
remodeling, and telomere elongation [18]. Additionally,
hnRNP K shuttles between the nucleus and the
cytoplasm and participates in 3’-end modification
and cleavage of pre-messenger (m)RNA and mRNA
stability [19]. Previous studies have indicated that
the functions and activities of hnRNP K are affected

RESULTS
Bortezomib inhibits Burkitt’s lymphoma cell
proliferation
The Daudi and CA46 cell lines are both derived
from human Burkitt’s lymphoma cells and express high
levels of c-Myc and BCL-2. However, Daudi cells are
EBV nuclear antigen (EBVA)-positive, while CA46 cells
are EBVA-negative. To investigate whether bortezomib
can inhibit proliferation of human Burkitt’s lymphoma
cells, we used both Daudi and CA46 cells. As shown in
Fig. 1, bortezomib significantly decreased the viable cell
numbers in dose- and time-dependent manners. The half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of bortezomib was
approximately 10 nM at 12 h in Daudi CA46 cells, and
approximately 50 nM at 24 h in CA46 cells. Prolonged
treatment with bortezomib at IC50 concentrations resulted
in gradual shrinking of the cells followed by cell death.
Therefore, cells were treated at IC50 concentrations in the
proteomic analysis.

assay. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.

Proteomic analysis of altered proteins in
bortezomib-treated Burkitt’s lymphoma cells

Mw of 24.2 kDa was upregulated; however, RGDI-2 with
a calculated Mw of 26.7 kDa was downregulated. Various
Mw forms of hnRNP K (with a theoretical Mw of 51.0 kDa)
were detected, which could be divided into a high-Mw
(HMw) group (of around 64 kDa) and a low-Mw (LMw)
group (of around 51 kDa). Interestingly, the HMw group
was downregulated, while the LMw group was upregulated
in bortezomib-treated Daudi and CA46 cells.

To investigate which proteins are altered in
bortezomib-treated Burkitt’s lymphoma cells, the
expression profiles of bortezomib-treated CA46 and
Daudi cells were analyzed by using two-dimensional
electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/MS. With a fixed
threshold of 2.0, the expression of 96 proteins in Daudi
cells and of 60 proteins in CA46 cells was found to
significantly differ between control and ­bortezomib-treated
cells. However, only 26 of the proteins in Daudi cells
were identified by using MALDI-TOF/MS followed
by a database search (Table 1). Of these 26 proteins, 17
were significantly upregulated, and 9 were significantly
downregulated in bortezomib-treated cells. The altered
proteins are presented in Fig. 2. In CA46 cells, 24 proteins
belonging to 22 protein classes were identified, among
which 19 were significantly upregulated and 5 significantly
downregulated in bortezomib-treated cells (Supplementary
Table S1). Five proteins were altered in both bortezomibtreated Daudi and CA46 cells, including hnRNP K, hnRNP
H, Hsp90α, Grp78, and Hsp7C, which are associated with
stress responses and mRNA processing. Several altered
proteins were detected in multiple spots and had different
molecular weights (Mws) and isoelectric points (PIs),
including hnRNP K, β-actin, α-tubulin 3, RGDI-2, and
Hsp60 in Daudi cells (Table 1), and Hspβ1 and hnRNP
K in CA46 cells (Supplementary Table S1). In particular,
different Mw forms of hnRNP K and RGDI-2 exhibited
opposite changes in expression level in bortezomib-treated
cells. In bortezomib-treated Daudi cells, the expression of
RGDI-2 with a theoretical Mw of 23.0 kDa and a calculated

Downregulation of sumoylated hnRNP K in
bortezomib-treated cells
To confirm the expression profile of hnRNP K
obtained from the proteomic analysis, we treated Daudi
cells with bortezomib and performed western blot
analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, bortezomib treatment
significantly decreased HMw but increased LMw hnRNP
K protein expression in time- and dose-dependent
manners. Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple
post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation,
methylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation, may
occur in hnRNP K [25, 26]. Most SUMO proteins are
approximately 12 kDa in mass, which matched the
difference between the HMw and LMw forms of hnRNP
K. To ascertain hnRNP K sumoylation, we performed
immunoprecipitation with an anti-hnRNP K antibody
followed by immunoblotting with an anti-pan-SUMO
antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, sumoylated hnRNP K was
detected in control Daudi cells, but it had decreased in
bortezomib-treated cells. To confirm these findings, we
performed immunoprecipitation with an anti-SUMO-1 or
anti-pan-SUMO antibody followed by immunoblotting
with an anti-hnRNP K antibody. The results verified

that sumoylated hnRNP K was present in control Daudi
cells, but decreased in bortezomib-treated cells. Next, we
investigated whether the HMw band (of around 64 kDa) in
Fig. 3 represented sumoylated hnRNP K. Daudi cells were
transiently transfected with pcDNA 3 control plasmid or
SUMO-1 expression plasmid and then treated with or
without bortezomib. As shown in Fig. 4B, the HMw band
was stained by the hnRNP K and pan-SUMO antibodies,
and the staining was weaker in bortezomib-treated cells.
Transfection of the cells with the Sra-HA-SUMO-1
plasmid increased the expression of HMw hnRNP K in a
dose-dependent manner as indicated by immunoblotting
with hnRNP K and SUMO-1 antibodies (Fig. 4C). Since
the HMw band represented sumoylated hnRNP K, the
SUMO molecules should be removed by SENP. As
shown in Fig. 4D, overexpression of wild-type SENP2
significantly decreased expression of HMw hnRNP K,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

while overexpression of mutant SENP2 did not. These
results suggested that hnRNP K sumoylation is a general
event in human Burkitt’s lymphoma cells, and bortezomib
decreases expression of sumoylated hnRNP K.

Sumoylated hnRNP K and c-Myc expression
are associated with proliferation of Burkitt’s
lymphoma cells
Burkitt’s lymphoma cells highly express the
c-Myc oncogene [5], which is upregulated by hnRNP
K both at the level of transcription and translation
[27, 28]. To investigate whether expression of
sumoylated hnRNP K and c-Myc is correlated with cell
proliferation, we cultured Daudi cells in different nutrient
conditions. Cells were either supplemented with serum
to stimulate cell proliferation or deprived of serum to

limit cell proliferation for different periods. As shown in
Fig. 5, expression of sumoylated hnRNP K and c-Myc
increased in a time-dependent manner in cells treated with
serum; however, expression of sumoylated hnRNP K and
c-Myc decreased under serum deprivation. These results
suggested that sumoylated hnRNP K and c-Myc may be
involved in regulating the proliferation of Daudi cells.

(Fig. 7A). Bortezomib treatment significantly decreased the
luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B).
Overexpression of SUMO-1 increased the luciferase activity;
however, overexpression of SENP1 and SENP2 decreased
the expression of sumoylated hnRNP K and luciferase
activity (Fig. 7C). In addition, overexpression of hnRNP
K and SUMO-1 significantly increased cell proliferation
(~1.46-fold), while treatment with bortezomib decreased
the cell proliferation induced by hnRNP K and SUMO-1
(Fig. 7D). These results suggested that c-Myc expression
is upregulated by sumoylated hnRNP K at the translational
level, and that sumoylated hnRNP K contributes to cell
proliferation.

c-Myc is upregulated by sumoylated hnRNP K
at the translational level in Burkitt’s
lymphoma cells
To investigate whether c-Myc is regulated by
sumoylated hnRNP K, we examined the mRNA and protein
levels of c-Myc in bortezomib-treated cells. As shown in
Fig. 6, bortezomib treatment decreased the c-Myc protein,
but not the mRNA level, in dose- and time-dependent
manners in Daudi cells, suggesting that c-Myc expression
is regulated at the translational level. Previous studies have
demonstrated that hnRNP K upregulates c-Myc expression
at the translational level, where hnRNP K is bound to the
internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) region of c-Myc
mRNA and increases c-Myc protein expression [28]. To
investigate whether sumoylated hnRNP K upregulates
c-Myc protein expression, we transiently transfected Daudi
cells with the pGL3-Myc-5′ UTR-Luc reporter plasmid
that contains human c-Myc IRESs and a partial c-Myc 5′
non-coding region before the firefly luciferase reporter gene

Lys422 may be the major sumoylation site in
hnRNP K
To predict the potential sumoylation sites in
hnRNP K, we used the SUMOplot Analysis Program
(http://www.abgent.com/sumoplot).
Among
seven
potential sumoylation sites, Lys422 had the highest
score (0.94) and, therefore, was considered the major
sumoylation site (Fig. 8A). To verify this hypothesis,
a mutant hnRNP K (Arg422) expression plasmid was
constructed. As shown in Fig. 8B, overexpression of
mutant hnRNP K resulted in a decrease in sumoylated
hnRNP K, suggesting that Lys422 may be the major
sumoylation site in hnRNP K.

DISCUSSION

A2/B1 and ~50-kDa hnRNP A2/B1 in HepG2 cells [34].
Based on western blot results and SUMOplot predictions,
a ~50-kDa form of hnRNP A2/B1 has been considered to
be the sumoylated, which may have protected the protein
from degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
[34]. Because the SUMO and ubiquitin modifications
occurred at the same Lys residue of the target protein,
they would be in competition. Similar to hnRNP A2/B1,
sumoylation of hnRNP K might have protected it from
degradation. In agreement with this hypothesis, normal
cultured cells expressed large amounts of HMw hnRNP
K, but barely expressed LMw hnRNP K. Bortezomib
decreased the expression of HMw hnRNP K and

In this study, different Mw forms of hnRNP K
were observed in bortezomib-treated Burkitt’s lymphoma
cells. The HMw and LMw forms of hnRNP K were
approximately 64 kDa and 51 kDa, respectively. Further
analysis indicated that the HMw form was sumoylated
hnRNP K and that Lys422 might have been the
sumoylation site. Previous studies have indicated that
several hnRNP family proteins such as hnRNP A1, hnRNP
F, and hnRNP K can be sumoylated, which may regulate
mRNA metabolism [25]. Overexpression of SUMO-1
increased the protein expression of ~38-kDa hnRNP

increased the expression of LMw hnRNP K. These
results suggested that the increase in LMw hnRNP K in
response to bortezomib might be mediated by protection
of hnRNP K from ubiquitin-proteasome degradation or
by desumoylation of sumoylated hnRNP K. Sumoylation
of hnRNP C and hnRNP M facilitated nucleocytoplasmic
transport of mRNAs and decreased their binding to nucleic
acids [35]. However, we demonstrated that sumoylated
hnRNP K increased the translational activity of Myc 5′
UTR IRES, suggesting that sumoylation promotes binding
of hnRNP K to the IRES nucleic acid segment, in contrast
to hnRNP C.
Similar to ubiquitin, SUMO can attach to proteins as
a single entity at one or multiple sites, to form mono- and
multi-monosumoylated proteins, respectively [36]. In
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

contrast, polysumoylation is the formation of a SUMO
chain on target proteins. Monosumoylation is the major
type of SUMO modification. In addition to the 64- and
51-kDa forms of hnRNP K, several other HMw bands
were detected when the film was exposed for a longer
time, which showed altered expression after bortezomib
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1, arrowheads). Similar
findings were obtained with another proteasome inhibitor,
MG132; treatment with MG132 altered the expression of
different Mw forms of hnRNP K. These results suggested
that endogenous hnRNP K might exist as multiple
sumoylated forms, and that inhibition of proteasome
activity might promote desumoylation of hnRNP K.
hnRNP K regulates protein expression at
both the transcriptional and translational levels. At

c-Myc expression might increase our understanding
of the action mechanisms of bortezomib in clinical
therapies of multiple myelomas and why multiple
c-Myc-overexpressing myelomas respond differently to
bortezomib compared to dexamethasone [44]. We found
that sumoylated hnRNP K positively regulates c-Myc
expression, which contributed to cell proliferation.
Previous studies have indicated that combined
treatment with bortezomib and other drugs such as
anti-β2-microglobulin monoclonal antibody [45] and
the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine [46]
overcomes bortezomib drug resistance in multiple
myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, respectively.
Therefore, treatment with sumoylation inhibitors alone
or in combination with bortezomib may be useful in
novel therapeutic strategies for multiple myelomas and
Burkitt’s lymphoma in future.

the transcriptional level, hnRNP K can bind to the
poly(C) region of promoters of genes including c-Src,
eIF4E, and c-Myc [37, 38]. In addition, hnRNP K can
increase FLIP expression by binding to the poly(C)
region of its promoter, leading to inhibition of tumor
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL)-induced apoptosis [39]. Apart from regulating
mRNA transcription rates, hnRNP K has been found to
bind to various specific mRNA sequences and to regulate
their translation activities. Chen et al. demonstrated
that hnRNP K increased thymidine phosphorylase (TP)
mRNA stability and protein translation by directly
interacting with the CU-rich element of TP mRNA
[40]. Another study showed binding of hnRNP K to
the 3′ UTR differentiation control element (DICE)
of 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) mRNA, which resulted in
inhibition of LOX mRNA translation [41]. Moreover,
hnRNP K upregulated c-Myc protein expression by
binding to the 5′ UTR IRES of c-Myc mRNA [28].
hnRNP A1 was phosphorylated upon interleukin (IL)-6
stimulation, which increased Myc protein translation by
binding to the IRES of Myc mRNA in multiple myeloma
cells [42]. In this study, bortezomib decreased both
sumoylated hnRNP K and c-Myc protein, but it did not
change the c-Myc mRNA level. Using the pGL3-Myc-5′
UTR-Luc reporter plasmid that contains human c-Myc
IRESs, we found that sumoylated hnRNP Kincreased the
reporter activity, while desumoylated hnRNP K did not.
These results suggested that hnRNP K regulates c-Myc
expression at the translational level, and sumoylation
plays an important role in binding of hnRNP Kto the
IRES of c-Myc mRNA.
Recent studies have revealed that c-Myc
overexpression indicates poor prognosis in multiple
myelomas [43]. Our finding that bortezomib inhibits

Cell culture and viability assay

The hnRNP K expression plasmid pCMV6-XL5-hnRNP
K (sc107869) was purchased from OriGene Technologies
(Rockville, MD), and the hnRNP K mutant (K422R)
expression plasmid was obtained from Yeastern Biotech
(New Taipei City, Taiwan). The pGL3-Myc-5′ UTR-Luc
reporter plasmid containing human c-Myc IRESs, a partial
c-Myc 5′ non-coding region, and the firefly luciferase gene
was generously provided by Professor Anne E. Willis
(University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK).
For gene overexpression, 5 × 106 cells were
transiently transfected with 10 μg of plasmid by
electroporation at 1000 V for 40 ms. For the reporter
gene assay, cells were transiently transfected with the
pGL3-Myc-5′ UTR-Luc reporter plasmid and phRL-TK
(Promega, Madison, WI) as an internal control plasmid
as per the above conditions and then seeded in a 24well plate. Drug-treated cell lysates were collected, and
luciferase activity was detected using the Dual-Luciferase®
Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Plate Chameleon
Multilabel plate reader (HIDEX OY, Turku, Finland)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase
activities of the reported plasmid were normalized to
luciferase activities of the internal control plasmid [50].

Human Burkitt’s lymphoma CA46 (BCRC
60511) and Daudi (BCRC 60192) cells were obtained
from the Food Industry Research and Development
Institute (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Both cell lines were cultured
in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY), and maintained in a humidified
incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. CA46 and Daudi cells
were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with various
concentrations of bortezomib for 24 h, and the cell viability
was determined by the 3-(4, 5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,
5-diphenytetrazoliumromide (MTT, Sigma Chemical,
St. Louis, MO) assay as described previously [47].

Western blotting
Total cellular proteins (30–50 μg) were fractionated by
sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE). After the proteins had been transferred onto
a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Merck Millipore,
Billerica, MA), the membrane was blocked in 1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) or 10% defatted milk for 1 h before
incubation with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.
Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using secondary
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) [48].

Two-dimensional electrophoresis and
gel imaging
Cells were lysed in solubilizing buffer (7 M urea,
4% CHAPS, and 2 M thiourea; Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ) and total cell lysates were collected
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein
samples were added to an ImmobilineTM DryStrip
(pH 3–10, 13 cm) (Amersham Biosciences), rehydrated at
50 μA/strip and 30 V for 12 h. Isoelectric focusing (IEF)
electrophoresis was carried out using the Ettan IPGphor
system (Amersham Biosciences) for another 12 h. The
linear voltage gradient conditions used were as follows:
from 0 to 250 V for 250 Vh, 500 V for 500 Vh, 1000 V
for 1000 Vh, 1500 V for 1500 Vh, 2000 V for 2000 Vh,
3000 V for 3000 Vh, 6000 V for 6000 Vh, and a final
phase of 8000 V for 40, 000 Vh. Then, the ImmobilineTM
DryStrip was placed on a 10% sodium dodecylsulfate
polyacrylamide gel and second-dimension electrophoresis
was performed. The gels were fixed with 10% methanol
and 7% acetic acid and stained with Sypro-Ruby dye
(Sigma) for 3 h.
Gel images were captured using a Typhoon 9400
densitometer and analyzed with PDQuest version 7.3.1
software (GE Healthcare). Protein spot detection and
matching were performed by both automated function and
manual designation. Spot intensities were obtained using
the quantitative and qualitative modes and normalized
to the background. Protein spot intensities with at least
2-fold difference compared to the control were considered
significantly different. Protein spots of interest were
collected, gel-digested by trypsin, and subjected to
MALDI-TOF/MS analysis.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells and
complementary (c)DNA was prepared as described
previously [49]. c-Myc and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs were amplified in
reactions mixtures comprising 500 ng of total cDNA
in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (at pH 8.3) containing
500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 200 μM of each
dNTP, and 50 units/mL of SuperTaq™ DNA polymerase
(Ambion, Austin, TX) and the following oligonucleotide
primers:
5′-AGCCCACTGGTCCTCAAGA-3′
and 5′-CCTCTTACAGTTCTCCGCTTG-3′ for c-Myc,
and 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′ and
5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ for GAPDH.
Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 94°C for
5 min, followed by 25 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for
1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C
for 8 min. PCR products were separated on 1.2% agarose
gels and stained with SYBR Green dye.

Plasmids and transient transfection
Gene expression plasmids SRa-HA-SUMO-1
(no. 17359), Flag-SENP1 (no. 17357), and Flag-SENP2
(no. 18047) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA).

We showed that several aspects of proteins can be
regulated by bortezomib, in particular, it downregulated
the expression of sumoylated hnRNP K and c-Myc
in human Burkitt’s lymphoma cells. Sumoylated
hnRNP K positively regulated c-Myc expression at the
translational level, and downregulation of sumoylated
hnRNP K by bortezomib resulted in a decrease in c-Myc
oncogene expression and subsequent inhibition of cell
proliferation. The Lys422Arg mutation decreased the
level of sumoylated hnRNP K, suggesting that hnRNP K
can be modified by SUMO and that Lys422 might be an
important sumoylation site in hnRNP K
