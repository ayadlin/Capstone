BACKGROUND: This study seeks to examine the relation between sociodemographic characteristics and the utilization of fertility preservation services in reproductive age women diagnosed with cancer. METHODS: A total of 1041
women diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18 and 40 years responded to a retrospective survey on demographic information and reproductive health history. Five cancer types were included: leukemia, Hodgkin disease,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer. Nine hundred eighteen women reported treatment with potential to affect fertility (chemotherapy, pelvic radiation, pelvic surgery, or bone marrow transplant).
Student t test, linear regression, and multivariate logistic regression were used where appropriate to determine the
relation between sociodemographic characteristics and the odds of using fertility preservation services. RESULTS:
Sixty-one percent of women were counseled on the risk of cancer treatment to fertility by the oncology team. Overall, 4% of women pursued fertility preservation. In multivariate analysis, women who had not attained a bachelor’s
degree (odds ratio [OR], 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-0.9) were less likely to be counseled. Trends also suggested possible disparities in access to fertility preservation with age older than 35 years (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-1.4) or
previous children (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1) at diagnosis. Disparities in access to fertility preservation based on ethnicity and sexual orientation were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic health disparities likely affect
access to fertility preservation services. Although awareness of fertility preservation has improved in the past decade,
an unmet need remains for reproductive health counseling and fertility preservation in reproductive age women diagC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
According to 2006 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) statistics, approximately 120,000 women
younger than 50 years develop cancer each year in the United States.1 Early screening techniques and cancer therapies
have improved cancer survival significantly over the past 20 years; the medical community is now turning to issues related
to life after cancer treatment.2 Young women face post-treatment reproductive concerns relating to infertility and premature menopause.3 Fertility preservation, saving eggs and/or embryos before treatment, appears to positively affect survivors’ quality of life.4,5 The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that all women be offered counseling and
the opportunity to take action to protect or preserve their fertility before cancer therapy.6
Advances in reproductive technology may have outpaced access. A 2008 study from the Netherlands showed that as
few as 2% of women preserved their fertility before cancer treatment.7 As recently as 2009, a survey of 249 oncologists at
major academic centers in the United States reported that 82% of physicians had referred a patient to a reproductive endocrinologist at some point, but more than half rarely refer.8 The reasons given for lack of referral were: lack of knowledge
about reproductive options, insufficient time to discuss the issue, perception that patients could not delay treatment, and
perception that if patients did not raise the issue themselves they were not interested.9

Original Article

A focus on patients’ access to education and resources is paramount in the discussion of postcancer treatment
fertility issues. Using a statewide cancer registry of reproductive aged women, we sought to determine whether
barriers to access exist within various sociodemographic
groups, and whether such barriers contribute to a low utilization of fertility preservation counseling and services
before cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed an analytical cross-sectional study, using
the California Cancer Registry to sample women across
the state. All study procedures were approved by the
University of California at San Francisco Committee on
Human Research.
Subjects
A computer-generated randomizer was used to sample
reproductive age women from the cancer registry that had
a history of leukemia, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, breast cancer, or gastrointestinal cancer.
These cancers were chosen for study because they are common, nongynecologic cancer groups that can be treated
with systemic chemotherapy. Patients were included in
the sample if they were 18 to 40 years of age at diagnosis
and were diagnosed between 1993 and 2007. Among
6709 patients initially selected for the study, 4147
patients were excluded because their contact information
in the cancer registry was outdated. Letters were sent to
the primary physicians of each of the remaining women
before we attempted to reach the patients. Additional
women were excluded if their physician thought participation in the study would cause undue psychological burden (because of severe comorbid mental illness, n ¼ 30
patients). After exclusions, 2532 patients were contacted
for participation in the study. Analyses of access included
only women who reported treatment with potential to
compromise fertility (ie, systemic chemotherapy, pelvic
radiation, pelvic surgery, or bone marrow transplant).
Survey
The survey was created at University of California at San
Francisco and assessed for readability and content validity
(the extent to which our survey accurately assessed reproductive health history and quality of life) by 2 independent experts in survey methodology. It was then tested on
20 patients from the University of California at San Francisco Center for Reproductive Health for content and

4580

readability. Additional changes were made in response to
this pilot study.
The survey was made available in both English and
Spanish. A professional translation company (American
Language Services, Los Angeles, Calif) translated the
study materials into Spanish using 2 independent translators. A third bilingual person checked translations. Paper
surveys were created using Cardiff Teleform (Vista, Calif).
Patients could also complete the survey online through
Surveymonkey.com (Palo Alto, Calif).
Recruitment
Women were contacted between January 2010 and September 2010. A contact letter was sent to potential participants, explaining the purpose of the survey; the source of
the individual’s personal contact information was the California Cancer Registry. Women were able to opt out of
further contact by reaching the University of California at
San Francisco study coordinator. After 1 week, a second
mailing was sent that included the written survey, a link to
the online survey, a written consent form, a postage-paid
return envelope, and an optional refusal postcard.
Women were asked to complete and return a written
consent form by mail and to return the survey by mail or
complete it online. Women who did not reply within 3
weeks received a reminder follow-up phone call. Those who
did not reply within 2 weeks of the reminder call were sent a
reminder postcard with a link to the electronic survey.
Primary Outcomes
Two binary outcomes were examined with respect to
several sociodemographic predictor variables. The first
outcome, counseling, refers to whether women were
counseled (yes/no) about the risk of their treatment to
fertility by a member of the oncology team. The second,
fertility preservation, refers to whether respondents
pursued fertility preservation (yes/no) under the care of a
reproductive endocrinologist.
We then sought to determine the yearly prevalence
of each of our 2 primary outcomes. Prevalence was calculated as affirmative responses (eg, counseled [yes]/all participants) for a given year of diagnosis (eg, in 1993, 14 of
32 patients [44%] were counseled).
Mediating Variables
Disease type, stage, and treatment type were considered as
potential confounders of our primary sociodemographic
exposure variables.8,9 To define stage, summary staging
was used. Summary staging is a California Cancer

Registry index used for epidemiologic assessment of cancers (1 ¼ in situ; 2 ¼ localized; 3 ¼ regional by direct
extension; 4 ¼ regional by lymph nodes; 5 ¼ regional by
direct extension and lymph nodes; 6 ¼ metastatic). Treatment types included having received the following categories of treatment: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or
bone marrow transplant.
Predictor Variables
Several sociodemographic characteristics were assessed by
survey. Some of these characteristics, such as ethnicity,
gender, income, attainment of college education, population density, and age at diagnosis, were chosen based on
previously observed disparities in general oncology and
fertility care.10-14 Although parity and marital status have
been previously associated with oncologists’ perceptions
of their patients’ fertility concerns, their association with
fertility counseling by oncologists or access to fertility
preservation has not been determined.15
Parity at diagnosis was defined as whether respondents reported previously having at least 1 child. Marital
status was defined as having a partner (spouse or significant other) versus being single at the time of diagnosis.
Sexual orientation was defined as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or other (the later 3 groups were combined
at analysis for the purpose of forming dichotomous variables as ‘‘other than heterosexual’’).
Annual income at the time of survey was divided into
3 groups: <$30,000; $30,001-$100,000; >$100,000.
Incomes of less than approximately $30,000 per year are
believed to be insufficient to adequately meet the basic
needs of an average American family.16 Those who have
household incomes near and above $100,000 are less
likely to report difficulties in establishing medical care
than women in lower income groups.17 Age groups at
diagnosis were divided into mostly 5-year segments to
achieve sufficient sample sizes for logistic regression (ages
18-25, 26-30, 31-35, and 36-40 years). Ethnicity was
defined by the following: Caucasian, Asian/Pacific
Islander, African American, Hispanic American or
Latina, and Native American.
Several variables, including year of diagnosis and age
at diagnosis, were derived from the cancer registry. Time
since diagnosis was derived as the difference between date
of diagnosis and date of recruitment. Population density
was defined in the California Cancer Registry as urban or
rural. Urban areas were defined in the cancer registry as
those with urban cores of 50,000 or more people, or areas
involved in direct regional commerce with these urban

cores. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a California Cancer
Registry socioeconomic index based on income and education of the patient and education for the census block
group of residence at diagnosis.
Data Analysis
Survey data were merged with California Cancer Registry
data with a unique, anonymous identifier code. Statistical
analyses were performed using Stata version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex). Statistical significance was
defined by 2-sided P values <.05.
Initially, Student t tests were used to compare the
characteristics of responders and nonresponders. Several
variables from the California Cancer Registry were available for all patients recruited for the study. Age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, summary staging, and SES were
used to assess potential differences between those women
who completed the survey and those who did not.
Logistic regression was used to determine the relation between sociodemographic predictors and the odds
of receiving counseling for fertility preservation or pursuing fertility preservation. Univariate analyses were initially
performed for each sociodemographic predictor to
evaluate the magnitude of effect on counseling as well as
fertility preservation. Multivariate analyses were then performed to adjust for the effect of potential confounding
variables (disease type, stage, and treatment) and the
effects of other sociodemographic variables whose univariate P value was <.2.
Finally, linear regression was used to determine
the rate of increase in the prevalence of counseling and
fertility preservation over time, while adjusting for the
effects of sociodemographic, disease, and treatment
characteristics.

RESULTS
Patient Sample
Of the 2532 women who were contacted, 1378 women
replied to our initial contact letter or survey. Of these, 337
refused and 1041 (41%) completed our survey. Fortyseven percent of participants completed it online and
53% on paper. Reasons for declining included: a request
to be removed from all cancer registry studies (57%), no
interest in further childbearing (10%), the topic of infertility was too emotionally difficult to discuss (2%), the
survey was too long (3%), or no reason given (28%). The
average time to complete the survey was 26 minutes. Of
the 1041 women who completed the survey, 918 reported

treatment with the potential to compromise their fertility
and were included in our analyses of fertility counseling
and preservation.
Table 1 shows comparisons of the 1041 responders
and 1491 nonresponders, based on disease and demographic data in the cancer registry. Patients who completed the survey were 1.4 years younger at diagnosis than
those who did not (P < .0001), and were diagnosed with
more aggressive cancers, as indicated by a SEER summary
stage index (range of 0 [in situ] to 7 [metastatic]) of 3.7
versus 3.4 (P ¼ .0008). There were no differences between
responders and nonresponders in SES (calculated from
median income and education for the census block group
of residence at diagnosis, P ¼ .8) or years since diagnosis
(P ¼ .2).
The age and childbearing desires of the 918 participants who reported treatment with potential to affect fertility are listed in Table 2. Patients with a history of breast
and gastrointestinal cancers tended to be oldest at diagnosis and most likely to have had children before treatment.
Depending on the type of cancer, between 47% and 63%
of respondents reported desiring to have children after
treatment, with the highest rates among women with leu-

4582

kemia (59%) and Hodgkin disease (63%). These latter 2
groups were also composed of women with the lowest
mean ages.
Access to Counseling by the Oncology Team
Overall, 61% of women were counseled on the risk of cancer treatment to fertility by the oncology team (Table 3).
Age at diagnosis, the desire for future children at diagnosis, and education level were significantly associated with
an increased odds of receiving fertility preservation counseling. No significant differences in access to counseling
were noted with regard to: parity, marital status, household income, sexual orientation, population density, or
ethnicity.
After adjustment for age, desire for future children,
parity at diagnosis, household income, ethnicity, disease
type, disease stage, and treatment type, achieving a higher
education level remained associated with increased counseling (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.0-2.1; Table 3). Women who had attained at least
a bachelor’s degree were 20% more likely to be counseled
than those who had not. Age at diagnosis and desire for
future children at diagnosis were not associated with

Access to Fertility Preservation
Overall, 4% of women underwent fertility preservation
(Table 4). Age at diagnosis, the desire for future children
at diagnosis, parity at diagnosis, and education level were
significantly associated with increased odds of pursuing
fertility preservation. There was a trend toward decreased
access for Latina women versus Caucasian women. No
significant differences in access to fertility preservation
were noted with regard to: marital status, household
income, or population density.

No one in these groups underwent fertility preservation.

After adjustment for age, desire for future children,
parity at diagnosis, education level, ethnicity, disease type,
disease stage, and treatment type, several differences persisted. For instance, women older than 35 years at diagnosis were approximately 90% less likely to preserve their
fertility than their 18- to 25-year-old counterparts (OR,
0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-1.4; Table 4); however, this difference
did not achieve statistical significance. A trend was seen
with regard to pretreatment parity, where women who
had already had at least 1 child at diagnosis had 70%

without children (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1); however,

Latina women were 80% less likely to preserve fertility
than Caucasian women (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.0-1.3),
although this difference did not achieve statistical
significance.

among the 31 women identifying as African American,

sexual orientation other than heterosexual, despite having
no differences in childbearing desires compared with
women identifying as heterosexual.
Counseling and Fertility Preservation
Rates Over Time
The prevalence of counseling by subjects’ oncology teams
was 44% in 1993. After adjustment for age, desire for
future children, parity at diagnosis, education, ethnicity,
disease type, disease stage, and treatment type, the prevalence of counseling increased significantly at a rate of
approximately 0.9% per year from 1993 to 2007 (R2 ¼
0.1; P < .05). The prevalence of fertility preservation was
0% in 1993. By 2000, the prevalence of fertility preservation was 2%. After controlling for age, desire for future
children, parity at diagnosis, education level, ethnicity,
disease type, disease stage, and treatment type, the prevalence of fertility preservation increased significantly at
approximately 1.3% per year from 2000 to 2007 (R2 ¼
.11; P ¼ .03; Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
Although the prevalence of both counseling and fertility
preservation utilization has increased over time, there
remains a large unmet need for fertility preservation.
Across the state of California, it appears that certain
groups of women are more likely to receive important
information about reproductive health at the time of diagnosis, and are also more likely to preserve their fertility
than others.

The prevalence of counseling and access to fertility
preservation observed in this study is consistent with that
previously reported by others. The 61% rate of counseling
observed in our study is similar to previously reported
rates of 34% to 72%.18 We observed that 4% of women
underwent fertility preservation, which is consistent with
the work of Jenninga and colleagues, whose data demonstrate a 2% rate of fertility preservation in the Netherlands
between 2002 and 2008 as well as low utilization rates at
academic medical centers in the United States.7,19,20 The
observed 4% rate of utilization is also similar to the low
utilization of infertility services in general.21 Consistent
with our observed rise in preservation rates starting in the
year 2000, Lee and colleagues found that over the past
decade women have become more likely to see fertility
physicians before cancer treatment to preserve fertility as
opposed to seeing them afterward to treat infertility.22
Certain aspects of SES appear to be associated with
access to counseling about fertility loss and access to fertility preservation. For instance, women who graduate with
a bachelor’s degree are more likely to discuss the risks of
cancer treatment to fertility than women who do not.
This may reflect an assertiveness and proactive attitude on
the part of patients with higher health literacy that may
have been associated with patients being more likely to
bring up the topic themselves. This is consistent with disparities seen in delivery of timely cancer care, where young
women with lower levels of education are more likely to
experience delays in diagnosis and treatment of cervical
and breast cancers.11 Medical providers report their lack
of awareness and comfort in discussing fertility, and their
lack of knowledge of available resources, as barriers to fertility discussions.23 A recent telephone survey of 282
French women, aged 20 to 44 years, who survived unspecified cancers indicated that, of the 37% of women who
reported treatment-induced infertility, 30% of those
women reported that they had not been informed of the
risk of infertility before their treatment.24 Because oncologists often do not discuss fertility unless the patient raises
the issue, patients may benefit from a certain education
background in their ability to pursue further information
independently.23
Household income may affect access. Although we
did not find a significant relation between income and
access, our relatively uneven distribution, with low
sampling of women with incomes <$30,000, may have
limited our ability to detect true differences. Women
whose household incomes are insufficient to adequately
meet the basic needs of an average American family may

4585

be less likely to receive infertility counseling by their
oncologists than women with higher incomes. Other
studies including young women with cancer have showed
that lower income is associated with poorer outcomes,
including increased probability of delay in diagnosis.11 In
a study of 314 cancer patients who were referred to a
reproductive endocrinologist for fertility services, Lee and
colleagues found no association between income and
whether women were able to present in a timely fashion
and preserve fertility versus whether they presented after
cancer treatment with diagnosed infertility.22 Duffy and
colleagues also showed in a study of 166 breast cancer survivors that income did not predict whether women were
counseled about fertility issues by their oncologist.23 The
possibility that income does impact one’s ability to access
fertility preservation would not be surprising, given that
fertility preservation is not routinely covered by insurance
and that the costs of fertility preservation are significant.25
The average total cost of clinical services, consultations,
procedures necessary to retrieve eggs and/or produce
embryos, and freezing services is between $8000 and
$24,000.26,27
Women who understand the potential benefits of
fertility preservation may be willing to make an extra
effort to seek out additional resources. Despite the cost, it
may be the case that women from lower income groups
receive financial assistance from nonprofit organizations
or from family members. We also observed no difference
in fertility preservation utilization between women who
live in urban areas and those in rural areas, despite the
need for women in rural regions to expend greater resources to travel further distances to specialized fertility
centers.
We found no differences in counseling or fertility
preservation with regard to partner status, but did show a
trend toward decreased rates of fertility preservation for
women who had previous children at the time of diagnosis. The finding that partner status does not predict counseling was also reported by Duffy and colleagues.23 Our
study, like Duffy et al’s, also showed no difference with
regard to counseling in women with previous children.
However, there was a decrease in utilization of fertility
preservation among women who were already parents at
diagnosis, despite controlling for age and parenting
desires. The emotional impact of not preserving fertility
could be higher in women without previous children. In
prior studies, women who experienced primary infertility
(desired a child at diagnosis but were never able to have a
child) experience greater distress than women with sec-

4586

ondary infertility (had at least 1 child at diagnosis but
were unable to have another).28,29
This study showed that women who are older than
35 years at diagnosis could be less likely to be counseled
than women in their early 20s, regardless of parenting
desires or parity at diagnosis. This is consistent with the
findings of Duffy and colleagues in young breast cancer
patients.23 Age also predicted lower rates of fertility preservation in our study by univariate analysis, but the relation did not retain significance in our multivariate model.
Age at diagnosis has been associated with increased risk of
cancer recurrence, with difficulty in obtaining insurance,
and with employment-base discrimination of young
women with cancer.30,31 Taken together with our findings, age could remain a focus of future study as a predictor of access to fertility preservation.
This is the first study to examine the association of
sexual orientation and utilization. In a study of 249 oncologists across the United States, Forman et al found that
when oncologists did not refer a patient to a reproductive
endocrinologist, in 1% of cases it was because the patient
identified as a lesbian.8 The study by Forman and colleagues did not comment on childbearing desires, so it is
difficult to determine whether these women requested or
declined referral based on parenting plans. This study
demonstrates that there is no significant association
between sexual orientation and oncologists counseling
women about potential reproductive compromise after
treatment. However, this study does show that, despite
there being no significant differences in parenting desires
based on sexual orientation, none of the women who
identified with an orientation other than heterosexual preserved her fertility. Given the low overall utilization rates,
our study may be underpowered, and possibly subject to
sampling bias, with 31 women not identifying as heterosexual. Assessing the impact of sexual orientation on seeking fertility preservation should also be a focus of future
research.
Caucasian women in our study appeared more
likely to seek fertility preservation services than Latina or
African American women, although our observation did
not achieve statistical significance. This is in contrast to
Lee and colleagues, who found that neither race nor ethnicity predicts whether women will present to fertility
centers for fertility preservation before cancer treatment
or for fertility care after cancer treatment.22 The data in
our study are consistent with patterns seen with regard to
health disparities in general infertility care, as women
from many ethnic backgrounds are less likely to have

access to any specialized fertility treatment, regardless of
whether it is before or after a cancer diagnosis. African
American women often seek fertility treatment after waiting a longer time with untreated infertility than Caucasian
women.32,33 Low-income Latino immigrant patients, as
well as African Americans and Arab Americans, face challenges in linguistic and cultural barriers as well as accessibility and affordability of treatment.34,35 Our findings are
consistent with patterns seen in general infertility treatment in Massachusetts, a state with mandated insurance
coverage for infertility services, where such services are disproportionately accessed by Caucasians, by the highly
educated, and by the wealthy.33
This study has several important strengths and limitations. A significant proportion of the eligible participants in our study were not reached. However, the
response was similar to that seen in several other registrybased studies of young female cancer survivors, with rates
of 26% to 51%,3,15,36,37 Given the importance of survivorship issues, the National Cancer Institute recently recommended the use of cancer registries as a means of
conducting studies that could rapidly yield information
about life after treatment.38,39 Despite the benefits of
registry-based studies, the possibility of sampling bias
remains a concern in this study. Whereas women who
responded were slightly younger at diagnosis than those
who did not, there were no differences with regard to SES.
It is also likely, given the consistency of our counseling
and preservation rates with those of other studies, that we
achieved a relatively accurate sampling of the population,
with regard to previous exposure to fertility preservation.
However, other important confounding factors that were
not controlled for in our study include the absence of information regarding current disease state (ie, recurrence
or not) and residual side effects.
We have observed that women who are childless,
younger, Caucasian, heterosexual, and who graduated
from college may be more likely than women of different
backgrounds to be counseled about the risks of cancer
treatment to fertility or to preserve fertility before cancer
treatment. A focus on the quality of counseling and the
quantity of patients seeing a fertility specialist has likely
led to improved rates of access over the past decade. However, failing to focus on equity will likely result in continued unequal distribution of reproductive health
counseling and fertility preservation. An opportunity lies
ahead to explore educational and policy interventions to
ameliorate health disparities that may exist in the growing
field of fertility preservation.
