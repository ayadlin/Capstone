ABSTRACT
The phosphoprotein phosphatases are emerging as important androgen receptor
(AR) regulators in prostate cancer (PCa). We reported previously that the protein
phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1α) can enhance AR activity by dephosphorylating
a site in the AR hinge region (Ser650) and thereby decrease AR nuclear export. In this
study we show that PP1α increases the expression of wildtype as well as an S650A
mutant AR, indicating that it is acting through one or more additional mechanisms. We
next show that PP1α binds primarily to the AR ligand binding domain and decreases its
ubiquitylation and degradation. Moreover, we find that the PP1α inhibitor tautomycin
increases phosphorylation of AR ubiquitin ligases including SKP2 and MDM2 at sites
that enhance their activity, providing a mechanism by which PP1α may suppress AR
degradation. Significantly, the tautomycin mediated decrease in AR expression was
most pronounced at low androgen levels or in the presence of the AR antagonist
enzalutamide. Consistent with this finding, the sensitivity of LNCaP and C4–2 PCa
cells to tautomycin, as assessed by PSA synthesis and proliferation, was enhanced
at low androgen levels or by treatment with enzalutamide. Together these results
indicate that PP1α may contribute to stabilizing AR protein after androgen deprivation
therapies, and that targeting PP1α or the AR-PP1α interaction may be effective in
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

mechanism driving its activity is intratumoral synthesis
of androgens from adrenal gland derived precursors
or de novo from cholesterol [1–4]. This activity can be
suppressed by drugs including abiraterone (which inhibits
the enzyme CYP17A1 required for androgen synthesis)
or by the direct AR antagonist enzalutamide, and both
abiraterone and enzalutamide are now approved for
treatment of CRPC [5, 6]. However, patients who respond
to these agents generally relapse within a year, and AR

INTRODUCTION
The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role
in prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression.
Most patients initially respond to androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT, surgical or medical castration), but
the tumors inevitably recur despite castrate levels of
androgen (castration-resistant prostate cancer, CRPC).
AR expression is generally increased in CRPC, and one

appears to still be contributing to the growth of these
relapsed tumors [7, 8]. Therefore, there remains a critical
need to identify further mechanisms contributing to AR
activity.
AR mRNA is highly expressed in CRPC with the
AR gene being amplified in many cases [9, 10], while
epigenetic mechanisms can further enhance AR gene
transcription [11, 12]. AR activity in CRPC also may
be enhanced by multiple kinase signaling pathways that
directly or indirectly increase AR protein stability or
transcriptional activity at low androgen levels [13, 14].
Recent findings have also underscored the significance
of protein phosphatases in regulating AR and in PCa
development. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) can bind
to AR and suppress its activity by dephosphorylation
of several sites [15, 16]. The physiological relevance
of PP2A in PCa development is supported by the
identification of alterations in PP2A and its subunits in
PCa model systems and clinical specimens during tumor
progression [17–19]. In contrast to PP2A, we reported
that the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1α)
can enhance AR activity by dephosphorylating a site
in the hinge region, Ser650 [16]. Phosphorylation of
this site was shown previously to enhance AR nuclear
export [20], and we found that PP1α inhibition decreased
nuclear expression of wild-type AR, but not an S650A
mutant AR [16].
In this study we show that PP1α can also
increase AR expression independently of S650
dephosphorylation. We find that PP1α binds to the AR
ligand binding domain and decreases AR ubiquitination
and degradation, particularly at low androgen levels or
in the presence of AR antagonists. Mechanistically, we
show that PP1α can dephosphorylate and inactivate
ubiquitin ligases that target AR for ubiquitylation and
degradation. Together these findings show that PP1α
can contribute to maintaining AR protein expression
and activity in CRPC, and that targeting PP1α or the
AR-PP1α interaction may be a novel therapeutic
approach.

as assessed by co-transfection of AR, PP1α and an AR
regulated reporter gene into HeLa cells or LNCaP PCa
cells (Figure 1A). Moreover, the effects of PP1α on the
wild-type and S650A mutant AR were comparable, with
the S650A having slightly more basal activity in the
absence of cotransfected PP1α (Figure 1B). To discount
effects from endogenous AR in LNCaP cells, we also
examined the role of S650 in a W741C mutant AR,
for which bicalutamide acts as an agonist versus being
an antagonist for wild-type AR [21]. Significantly, the
bicalutamide stimulated activities of both the W741C
and W741C/S650A double mutant ARs in LNCaP
cells were similarly increased by PP1α co-transfection
(Figure 1C).
Together these results indicated that PP1α
may regulate AR activity by one or more additional
S650 independent mechanisms. Consistent with our
previous report [16], PP1α overexpression in transient
transfections increases AR protein (Figure 1D), and
this increase could be prevented by treatment with the
PP1α inhibitor tautomycin (Supplementary Figure
S1). While tautomycin at comparable concentrations
can also inhibit PP2A, we showed previously that
PP2A increases AR degradation and that the PP2Aspecific inhibitor fostriecin increases AR protein [16]
(see also Supplementary Figure 2). PP1α inhibition
with tautomycin also decreased endogenous AR
protein in both LNCaP and C4–2 cells, particularly in
steroid-depleted medium without addition of androgen
(dihydrotestosterone, DHT) (Figure 1E). Significantly,
tautomycin similarly decreased expression of the
transiently transfected S650A mutant AR in HeLa cells
(Figure 1F), and the stably expressed S650A mutant AR
in LNCaP cells (Figure 1G, and Supplementary Figure
S3). In both cases this effect was most pronounced in
steroid-depleted medium in the absence of exogenous
DHT. These results show that one mechanism through
which PP1α can increase AR activity independently of
S650 dephosphorylation is by increasing AR protein.

DNA binding domain is not essential for binding

RESULTS

As PP1α and AR can form a complex [16],
we next focused on the identification of molecular
determinants mediating the PP1α-AR interaction
and their role in increasing AR protein. PP1α has
two consensus docking motifs shared by interacting
partners, R/K-x(0,1)-V-x-F and F-x-x-R/K-x-R/K,
where x stands for any amino acid [22]. AR has one
potential PP1α binding motif, KVFF, locating in the
DNA-binding domain (DBD) and in the vicinity of
the zinc finger 1 that mediates DNA binding (Figure
2A). Interestingly, all class I steroid receptors (AR/GR/
PR/MR) except ERα possess this motif. Moreover, we
found that PP1α cotransfection could also enhance the

PP1α can enhance AR activity independently of
S650 phosphorylation site
Phosphorylation of AR at S650 enhances its
nuclear export and subsequent degradation [20]. We
reported previously that PP1α interacts with AR and
dephosphorylates S650, thereby increasing nuclear
AR in PCa cells [16]. In support of this conclusion, we
showed that PP1α inhibition with tautomycin decreased
nuclear levels of the wild-type AR, but not an S650A
mutant AR. However, in further studies we have found
that PP1α overexpression enhances the transcriptional
activity of both the wild-type and S650A mutant AR,

transcriptional activity of GR and MR, but not ERα,
suggesting a possible role for this site in mediating
an interaction with PP1α (Supplementary Figure S4).
Consistent with the essential function of this site for
DNA binding, disruption of this motif by mutagenesis
(KVFF to KAFA) resulted in complete transcriptional
inactivation of AR (Figure 2B).
We then took a coimmunoprecipitation approach
to assess for a role of this candidate motif in the
AR-PP1α interaction. As shown in figure 2C, wildtype and KAFA mutant AR pulled down comparable
amounts of PP1α in both 293T and Cos1 cell lines. As
a complementary approach, we also used microcystinagarose beads to precipitate endogenous PP1α and to
assess its interaction with AR [16]. The results showed
that in HeLa cells PP1α associates both with the wildtype and the KAFA mutant AR (Figure 2D). To further
substantiate the above findings, we next generated an
AR-DBD fragment and its mutated counterpart (DBDKAFA) and assessed binding to PP1α. The results

indicated that PP1α may interact with the AR-DBD,
but that this interaction was not mediated by the KVFF
motif (Figure 2E). Together, these results indicated that
the KVFF site plays minimal if any role in PP1α-AR
interaction.

PP1α interacts predominantly with the AR
ligand-binding domain
We next systematically assessed the association
between PP1α and a panel of constructs spanning
the AR N-terminal domain (NTD) that bears the
major transcriptional activation function, the central
DNA-binding domain (DBD), and the C-terminal
ligand-binding domain (LBD). Analysis in androgencontaining medium demonstrated that PP1α could
associate with the isolated NTD and LBD, with the
inclusion of the DBD not causing an appreciable
increase in binding (Figure 3A). Comparison with the
inputs further indicates that PP1α has higher affinity

cells were co-transfected with AR-S650A mutant and PP1α, together with ARE4-Luc reporter and CMV-Renilla (internal control). The

for the AR LBD than the NTD. We similarly observed
preferential binding to the AR LBD when cells were
cultured in steroid-depleted medium (Figure 3B). It
should be noted while AR is primarily cytoplasmic in
the absence of ligand and accumulates in the nucleus
in response to androgen, PP1α is highly expressed in
the nucleus and cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure S5).
Therefore, cellular localization is less likely to be a
major factor dictating the association between PP1α and
these AR domains.
Notably, the PP1α-associated AR migrated on the
gels as a major band with a series of distinct minor bands
separated by ~8 KDa, consistent with ubiquitylation. To
confirm that these bands were ubiquitylated AR, we coexpressed histidine-tagged ubiquitin (his-Ub) together with
PP1α and AR, and then used Nickel(Ni)-NTA resin under
denaturing conditions to pull-down ubiquitylated proteins.
Immunoblotting for the HA-tagged AR then revealed
higher molecular weight bands indicative of ubiquitylation
associated primarily with constructs containing the LBD
(Figure 3C). It should be noted that we also observed bands
whose migration was consistent with the unmodified DBDLBD or LBD fragments (see also Supplementary Figure S6),
which we presume reflect weak nonspecific binding to the
resin compared to the ubiquitylated proteins that were highly
enriched by the resin. We observed a similar pattern in the

absence of transfected PP1α, consistent with the AR LBD
being the primary target for ubiquitylation (Figure 3D).

PP1α stabilizes AR by decreasing AR LBD
polyubiquitylation
The above findings suggested that PP1α may
stabilize AR protein by decreasing ubiquitylation of the
LBD. To examine this further, we assessed effects of
PP1α overexpression and proteasome inhibitor (MG132)
treatment on ubiquitylation of the AR LBD. In the
absence of transfected PP1α, treatment with MG132
increased both the levels of oligo- and poly-ubiquitylated
AR LBD (Figure 4A). In contrast, these ubiquitylated
AR species, and in particular the polyubiquitylated AR,
were not increased by MG132 in cells cotransfected with
PP1α. Cotransfection of PP1α similarly decreased the
polyubiquitylation of full length AR (Figure 4B).
To determine whether this PP1α mediated decrease
in AR polyubiquitylation resulted in decreased AR
degradation, we next used cycloheximide to block new
protein synthesis and thereby assess AR protein stability.
PP1α cotransfection markedly decreased degradation of
full length AR (Figure 4C). Moreover, consistent with
PP1α suppressing polyubiquitylation of the AR LBD,
PP1α cotransfection also markedly increased stability

of the AR LBD, but not the AR NTD-DBD fragment
(Figure 4C). Finally, PP1α with an H248K mutation that
inactivates its phosphatase activity was unable to increase
AR protein, indicating that PP1α stabilizes AR through
dephosphorylation of one or more substrates (Figure 4D).

degradation can be enhanced by phosphorylation at
multiple sites including S395, and previous reports
indicate that PP1α can decrease the degradation of MDM2
by dephosphorylating this site [27]. However, MDM2
activity can also be enhanced by growth factor stimulated
phosphorylation of sites including S166 and S186 [28].
Effects of PP1α on SKP2 have not been addressed
previously. Therefore, we next assessed whether PP1α
may dephosphorylate and inactivate these ubiquitin ligases
to attenuate AR ubiquitylation and degradation.
Consistent with previous reports, AR protein
expression was decreased by cotransfection of MDM2

or SKP2 (Figure 5A). Cotransfection of PP1α resulted
in a dramatic increase in the levels of transfected
MDM2 and SKP2, which appears to be primarily
due to increased transcription and translation from
the expression vectors rather than decreased protein
degradation. However, this may also in part reflect PP1α
mediated inactivation of MDM2 and SKP2 enzymatic
activities, as this would suppress autoubiquitylation
and degradation [29, 30]. In either case, despite the
dramatic increases in MDM2 and SKP2, there were no
increases in the ability of these proteins to suppress AR
expression, indicating that their activity was markedly
impaired by PP1α (Figure 5A).
To determine whether endogenous PP1α may
regulate the phosphorylation and activity of these
ubiquitin ligases, we treated HeLa and LNCaP
cells with tautomycin and assessed for effects on
endogenous MDM2 and SKP2. We did not observe
clear increases in MDM2 or SKP2 in either cell line
(Figure 5B). However, tautomycin increased MDM2

phosphorylation at S166, which has been reported to
enhance MDM2 activity [28]. Similarly, tautomycin
increased SKP2 phosphorylation at S72, a site that
may be phosphorylated by AKT and lead to increased
stability and activity [31, 32]. Consistent with increased
activity of MDM2 and SKP2, tautomycin treatment
decreased levels of their respective substrates, p53 and
p27 (Figure 5C).
Taken together these findings indicated that
PP1α inhibition may increase AR ubiquitylation and
degradation by increasing the activity of one or more
AR degrading ubiquitin ligases. However, it was not
clear whether or how these effects on MDM2 of SKP2
were related to the PP1α-AR interaction. Therefore,
we next asked whether AR could function as a scaffold
to bridge PP1α and MDM2 or SKP2. HeLa cells were
transfected with Flag-tagged PP1α and MDM2 or
SKP2, with or without cotransfected AR. Anti-Flag
immunoprecipitation then indicated that the PP1α-SKP2
association was substantially increased by cotransfected

AR, consistent with a scaffold function (Figure 5D).
AR cotransfection similarly increased the level of
MDM2 that was coprecipitated with PP1α, but AR also
increased input levels of MDM2, making interpretation
of the result less clear (Figure 5D). Further studies to
address this issue are now focused on identification of
site directed mutations that can selectively impair the
AR-PP1α interaction.

(Figure 6B). Therefore, we examined the effects of
tautomycin on AR activity in LNCaP and C4–2 cells
without and with enzalutamide. In both cell lines, the
inhibitory effects of tautomycin were enhanced by
enzalutamide (Figure 6C). Collectively these findings
indicate that agents targeting PP1α may enhance the
efficacy of androgen deprivation therapies and be
effective in CRPC.

Androgen deprivation and AR antagonists
sensitize PCa cells to PP1α inhibition

DISCUSSION
AR undergoes basal and ligand stimulated
phosphorylation at multiple sites, and these modifications
can modulate it stability, cellular localization and
transcriptional activity. AR phosphorylation may also
be regulated by protein phosphatases, including PP2A
and PP1. PP2A can dephosphorylate multiple sites in
the AR N-terminal domain, including S81, S94, S258,
S308, and S424, that are normally increased in response
to androgen and are associated with increased AR
transcriptional activity [15]. Significantly, PP2A access
to these sites may be negatively regulated by androgen
binding, indicating that a physiological function of PP2A
may be to suppress basal AR activation in the absence of
androgen [33].

As noted in Figure 1, effects of tautomycin on
AR protein expression in LNCaP and C4–2 cells were
most marked under conditions of androgen deprivation.
Therefore, we compared the effects of tautomycin in
C4–2 cells cultured in androgen depleted medium
without or with added DHT. Consistent with its effects
on AR protein under these conditions, tautomycin
was more potent at reducing expression of PSA and
proliferation under androgen depleted conditions
(Figure 6A).
Significantly, effects of tautomycin on AR protein
expression in LNCaP and C4–2 cells were also enhanced
by treatment with the AR antagonist enzalutamide

In contrast to PP2A, we had previously shown that
PP1α could bind to AR and dephosphorylate AR at S650
in the hinge region and thereby suppress AR nuclear
export, providing a mechanism by which PP1α can
enhance AR activity [7]. In the current study we found
that PP1α could also suppress the polyubiquitylation of
the AR LBD and its subsequent degradation, and that
PP1α inhibition with tautomycin could thereby decrease
AR expression independently of S650 dephosphorylation.
Mechanistically, we found that PP1α inhibition with
tautomycin increased the phosphorylation of MDM2
and SKP2 at sites that could enhance their activities,
suggesting that PP1α may suppress AR ubiquitylation by
dephosphorylating these sites. Further results indicated
that AR may mediate an interaction between PP1α and
these ubiquitin ligases, but further studies are needed
to determine the relationship between the AR-PP1α
association and PP1α mediated dephosphorylation of
MDM2, SKP2, and potentially other ubiquitin ligases.
This study also found that PP1α binding to AR is
mediated primarily by the AR LBD. Although the precise

site on the LBD remains to be determined, it does not
appear to be the coactivator binding site as binding is not
ligand dependent. We also cannot rule out that binding
is indirect and mediated by a not yet identified PP1
regulatory protein. An attractive hypothesis is that PP1α
associated with the AR LBD directly protects AR from
ubiquitylation by locally inactivating ubiquitin ligases.
Alternatively, PP1α may more globally suppress a subset
of ubiquitin ligases, with the AR associated PP1α having
distinct functions including the dephosphorylation
of S650. Further studies are underway to test these
hypotheses.
In any case, these findings indicate that therapies
targeting PP1α, or possibly the AR-PP1α interaction,
may have efficacy in CRPC. Significantly, the decrease
in AR protein in response to tautomycin was most
dramatic under androgen depleted conditions and in cells
treated with the AR antagonist enzalutamide. Therefore,
PP1α activity may play a particularly important role in
maintaining AR expression in CRPC and in resistance to
enzalutamide.

10% FBS. PC3, 293T, HeLa, and Cos1 cells were grown
in DMEM medium with 5% FBS. For androgen-starved
conditions, cells were grown in medium containing 5%
CDS. Cellular fractionation assay were carried out with
the NE-PER kit (Pierce), following the manufacture’s
direction. For transfection, cells were grown in normal
growth medium to ~80% confluence and plasmid DNA
was transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000. Empty
relevant vectors (such as pCDNA3.1, HA vector, and Flag
vector) were supplemented to equalize the total amount of
plasmids in the transfections. After overnight transfection,
the cultures were refreshed with indicated medium for
treatments. The pCMV-pRL-Renilla and androgenresponsive reporter plasmids have been described
previously [16]. Additional steroids, steroids receptors
and reporters were from the Balk lab. Luciferase activities
were measured with the Dual-Luc assay kit (Promega). The
ratios between Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities are
shown as relative light units (RLU), and the results reflect
the mean and standard deviation from triplicate samples.

Immunoprecipitations (IPs)
For coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), cells were
harvested in triton lysis buffer (TLB) containing protease
inhibitors. The lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min
and centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed. 20 μl of the
supernatant was saved as input and the rest was incubated
with anti-Flag beads, followed by incubation at 4°C on
a rotator for 2 hr. Then the input and washed (4x) IP
beads were boiled in 60 μl of Laemmli buffer containing
5% β-mercaptoethanol. For immunoprecipitation (IP)
under denatured conditions, cells were harvested by
boiling in 2% SDS followed by 20x dilution the TLB.
The test then proceeded as the above regular IP. For the
ubiquitylation and Ni(nickel)-NTA-IP assay, the cells were
washed in PBS and an aliquot was lysed in RIPA buffer
as input. The rest was lysed in buffer A (6M guanidine
HCl, 0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mM imidazole,
pH 8.0), followed by sonication and centrifugation. The
supernatants were incubated with Ni-NTA beads at room
temperature for 3 hrs, followed by wash 2x with buffer A,
2x with buffer A/buffer TI (1:3), and 1x with buffer TI (25
mM Tris-Cl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 6.8). Then both input
and the IP yields were boiled in 60 μl of Laemmli buffer
containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Microcystin-IP was as
previously described [16].

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 2 days and
then treated for 3 days as indicated. The cell proliferation
analysis was performed with the CellTiter-Glo assay kit
(Promega), following the manufacture’s manual.

Western blot data processing
The Western blotting was developed based on
X-Ray film (Research Products International) and the
western lightning Plus-ECL reagent (PerkinElmer). The
images were acquired using the CanoScan LiDE 210
scanner and processed using the Adobe Photoshop 7.0
software. Relevant images were quantified by using the
ImageJ software. All gels shown are representative of
results from at least three experiments.

Gene expression analysis

Plasmids and DNA mutagenesis

RNA isolation was carried out using the TriZOL
reagent and the qRT-PCR analysis on gene expression
was performed with the TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR
Master Mix Reagents (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan
primer and probe sets for gene expression assay: PSA:
Forward, 5′- GATGAAACAGGCTGTGCCG-3′; Reverse,
5′- CCTCACAGCTACCCACTGCA-3′; Probe, 5′- FAMCAGGAACAAAAGCGTGATCTTGCTGGG-3′. The
TaqMan primer-probe set for GAPDH transcripts (internal

The AR constructs were generated based on the
pcDNA3.1(+)-Kozak-HA-HA vector and cover the
following regions: HA-HA-AR full-length (aa 1–919);
HA-HA-AR-NTD (aa 1–539); HA-HA-AR-NTD-DBD
(aa 1–628); HA-HA-AR-DBD (aa 538–628); and HAHA-AR-DBD-LBD (aa 538–919). The HA-AR-LBD
(aa 662–919) vector was from our Lab. The untagged
PP1α plasmid was from Origene and then cloned into the
1762

Oncotarget

3x-Flag-CMV-10 vector (Sigma-Aldrich) to generate the
Flag-PP1α expression plasmid. The his-Ub, Flag-Ub, FlagSox9, HA-MDM2 and HA-SKP2 expression plasmids
were kindly provided by Drs. Pengda Liu, Wenjian Gan,
Xin Yuan, and Inuzuka Hiroyuki (BIDMC), respectively.
DNA mutagenesis on AR and PP1α was performed
with the Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis Kit
(Stratagene). Details for plasmids and mutants generation
