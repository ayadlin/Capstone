BACKGROUND. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of
cancer death. Smoking, diabetes, and pancreatitis are risk factors. It has been
shown that the growth of PDAC and pancreatic duct epithelial cells is regulated
by beta-adrenoreceptors (b-ARs). The activity of b-ARs in the central nervous sys-

tem is counteracted by g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) via GABAB receptor-mediated
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The aim of the study was to investigate if GABABR
inhibits b-AR signaling in PDAC and pancreatic duct epithelial cells, thus blocking driving forces of cancer progression, such as cell proliferation and cell
migration.

METHODS. Intracellular cAMP was measured by immunoassays, DNA synthesis
by BrdU incorporation assays, activation of ERK1/2 by ERK activation assays, and
Western blots and metastatic potential by cell migration assays in the human
PDAC cell lines PANC-1 and BXPC-3 and immortalized human pancreatic duct
epithelial cells HPDE6-C7. The expression of norepinephrine, PKARIIa, and GABA
in PDAC microarrays was assessed by immunohistochemistry.

RESULTS. Stimulation of the GABABR by GABA or baclofen inhibited isoproterenol-induced cAMP signaling below base levels. ERK1/2 activity in response to isoproterenol was blocked by GABA, an effect enhanced by transient overexpression
of the GABABR and abolished by GABABR knockdown. DNA synthesis and cell
migration were stimulated by isoproterenol, responses blocked by GABA and
baclofen. Norepinephrine and PKARIIa were overexpressed while GABA was
underexpressed in human PDAC tissue arrays.
CONCLUSIONS. The data suggest the stimulation of GABABR signaling as a novel
target for

the treatment and

prevention of

pancreatic

cancer. Cancer

ancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality
in Western countries.1 About 95% of pancreatic cancers are ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). PDAC is among the most aggressive of
human cancers and is generally unresponsive to conventional therapy, resulting in a mortality near 100% within 1 year of diagnosis.1
The regulation of PDAC and pancreatic duct epithelia is poorly
understood. Most PDACs harbor activating point mutations in K-ras,
while also overexpressing the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), leading to the hypothesis that EGFR signaling via ras and
the extracellular signal regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) pathway
regulate PDAC.2 Moreover, the arachidonic acid-metabolizing
enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in about 90% of
PDACs.3 Studies in vitro and in human pancreatic cancer mouse
xenografts have shown significant reductions in tumor growth by
inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, EGFR tyrosine kinases, ERK1/2.1,4

Likewise, inhibitors of COX-2 have yielded impressive
antitumorigenic effects in vitro.4 Suppression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) has also
shown promising responses in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model of PDAC.5 However, clinical trials
with inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, ras, COX-2, VEGF,
or the combination of such agents have had disappointing results.6
Smoking, diabetes mellitus, and pancreatitis are
risk factors for PDAC.7 However, the mechanisms by
which these risk factors contribute to the development of PDAC are poorly understood.
We have shown that cell lines derived from
human PDACs express b1- and b2-adrenoreceptors
(ARs) and respond to their stimulation by agonists
with the release of arachidonic acid and cell proliferation.8,9 Our findings provided evidence, for the
first time, that neurotransmitter receptors of the
beta-adrenergic family participate in the growth regulation of PDAC.
Nicotine causes the release of the physiologic
agonists for b-ARs, the catecholamine stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine, from the
adrenal medulla.10 Identification of beta-adrenergic
signaling as a growth regulator of pancreatic cancer
cells8 suggests that the elevated systemic catecholamine levels in smokers may contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer. Our studies showed
that the nicotine-derived carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) mimicked
the actions of the catecholamines by binding as an
agonist to b1- and b2-ARs.8 We recently showed that
the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and NNK
stimulated the proliferation of human pancreatic
duct epithelial cells by signaling via cAMP/PKA/pCREB, while in addition transactivating the EGFR
and ERK1/2 in a PKA-dependent manner.11 Beta-adrenergic activity of NNK resulting in mitogenic and/
or antiapoptotic signaling has in addition been
reported in cell lines from human small airwayderived adenocarcinomas,12,13 human small airway
epithelia,12 and in colon cancer cells.14 It has been
shown that the migration and invasiveness of adenocarcinomas of the colon, prostate, and breast are
also under beta-adrenergic control,15–17 and that
ERK1/2-mediated proliferation of breast cancer cells
is stimulated by beta-adreneregic agonists.18 Recent
publications in addition demonstrated that the nicotine-induced increase in systemic catecholamines stimulated the growth of xenografts from human
gastric carcinoma via activation of b-ARs19 and that
epinephrine increased the invasiveness of ovarian
cancer cells via stimulation of b-ARs.20 A novel concept is thus emerging of b-AR hyperstimulation as

an important etiologic factor for some of the most
common human cancers, including PDAC.
Beta-adrenoreceptors consist of b1, b2, and b3ARs and are G-protein-coupled cell membrane
receptors. Beta1 and b2-ARs are expressed in most
mammalian cells. Binding of an agonist to b-ARs
activates the adenylyl cyclase stimulating G-protein,
Gas, resulting in the formation of cAMP. In turn,
cAMP activates PKA by binding to the PKA subunit
complex, resulting in the release of inhibitory R subunits and activation of the transcription factor, cAMP
response element binding protein (CREB).21 It has
been shown that b1- and b2-ARs can in addition
transactivate the EGFR pathway in a PKA-dependent
manner22 and we have shown that such transactivation occurs in human pancreatic duct epithelial
cells.11,23
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous
system and counteracts the stimulatory actions of
the physiological agonists for b-ARs, epinephrine,
and norepinephrine in the brain.24 Three types of
GABA receptors have been identified: the ion channel
receptor families GABAA and GABAC, and GABAB
receptors which exist as 2 isoforms termed GABABR1
and GABABR2.25 Both GABABR isoforms are coupled
to the adenylyl cyclase inhibiting G-protein, Gai.25
GABAA and GABAC receptors mediate excitatory
functions of GABA, whereas the GABAB receptors
mediate the inhibitory actions of GABA.25 In the pancreas, GABA, its synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid
decarboxylase, and its metabolizing enzyme, GABAtransaminase, are expressed in the beta cells of pancreatic islets at high concentrations similar to those
in the central nervous system, and GABA is secreted
from beta-cells into the extracellular space.24 However, the function of GABA in the pancreas is poorly
understood. GABA is decreased in the pancreas of
individuals with diabetes mellitus24 due the reduction of functional islet beta cells. The number of
functional pancreatic islets is also diminished in
pancreatitis. The inhibitory role of GABA in the central nervous system and the finding that the
GABABRs inhibits adenylyl cyclase via activation of
Gai prompted us to explore a potential inhibitory
action of GABA on the cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic stimulation of human PDAC and pancreatic duct
epithelial cells. Our data show that stimulation of the
GABAB receptor potently inhibited isoproterenolinduced cAMP signaling, cell proliferation, and cell
migration. Moreover, human PDACs overexpressed
norepinephrine and PKARIIa while underexpressing
GABA. These data suggest that the reduction in pancreatic GABA may contribute to the development of

PDAC. Therapeutic administration of GABA or a
GABABR selective agonist may thus provide an effective novel tool for the treatment and prevention of
pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines
The human PDAC cell line, PANC-1, which carries an
activating point mutation in K-ras and BXPC-3, without ras mutation (American Type Culture Collection,
Rockville, Md) were cultured as suggested by the
vendor: RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and L-glutamine (2 mM) for BXPC-3
and DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, L-glutamine (2 mM) for PANC-1. The
immortalized human pancreatic duct epithelial cell
line HPDE6-C726 (Dr. M.S. Tsao, Ontario Cancer Center, Ontario, Canada) was maintained in serum-free
keratinocyte medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (25 mg/500 mL), EGF (2.5 mg/500
mL). Cells were washed to remove supplements
before each assay, and all assays were conducted in
basal media without supplements.
Analysis of Intracellular cAMP by Immunoassay
Cells were plated at 4 3 105 cells/well in 6-well
plates in their growth medium until 65% to 70% confluence. The medium was replaced by basal medium
without supplements after 3 washes with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 24 hours.
The cells were preincubated (30 minutes) with the
phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine
(IBMX; 1 mM) to prevent the enzymatic breakdown
of cAMP formed in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol
(1 lM; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo) was added to the culture medium with or without a 4-hour preincubation
with GABA (30 lM) or the selective GABAB receptor
agonist baclofen (30 lM). After 3 washes with water,
cells were treated with 0.1 M HCL for 20 minutes,
then lysed by sonication. Intracellular cAMP was
measured with an enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay
Designs, Ann Arbor, Mich) as previously described.27
Assays were conducted in triplicate, each with triplicate samples. Statistical analysis of data was by 1way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey-Kramer
multiple comparison test, and 2-tailed unpaired
t-test.
BrdU Incorporation Assays
BrdU incorporation assays were conducted with a kit
(Roche Applied Science, Nutley, NJ) as previously
described.12 Cells were cultured in 96-well plates

769

(1 3 104/well), deprived of serum and supplements
for 24 hours, and then either treated with isoproterenol (10 nM) for 72 hours, pretreated for 4 hours with
GABA (30 mM) or baclofen (30 lM), or they were
exposed to each of the inhibitors alone for the duration of the assay. Cells were labeled with 10 mL/well
BrdU and reincubated at 378C for 4 hours. After removal of the labeling medium, cells were fixed and
probed with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody and its
substrate, tetramethyl-benzidine, for 1 hour. After removal of the antibody conjugate the cells were rinsed
3 times with washing solution and substrate solution
(100 lL/well) was added. After color development
the absorbance of each sample was measured in an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader
at 370 nm. A blank was run in each experiment to
provide information about BrdU and anti-BrdU nonspecific binding. The nonspecific binding was subtracted from all other values. Each experiment was
conducted twice with 5 replicates per data point. Statistical analysis of data was by 1-way ANOVA and
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test.

Cell Migration Assay
The metastasis of cancer cells is facilitated by their
ability to migrate. Measurement of cell migration is
therefore frequently used as a tool to assess the metastatic potential of cancer cells. We used a colorimetric cell migration assay kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego,
Calif) consisting of 24-well plates that contain polycarbonate membrane filter inserts (8 lM pore size).
Cells (0.5 3 106 cells per mL of basal medium) were
seeded onto the top chamber above the filter insert
and pretreated for 4 hours with GABA (30 lM) or
baclofen (30 lM). Isoproterenol (10 nM) was then
added. After a 24-hour incubation period, nonmigratory cells were removed from the top of the filters by
cotton swab. The filter with cells that had migrated
to its bottom surface were incubated with staining
solution for 10 minutes, washed 3 times with tapwater, air-dried, and photographed. Each filter was
extracted and 100 lL per sample of the extract was
transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate. Optical density at 560 nm was read with a plate reader. Each
assay was conducted in triplicate. Statistical analysis
of data was by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer multiple
comparison test.
Transient Transfection With Stealth Select RNAi for
GABAB-R1 or With GABAB-R1 cDNA
Cells (>90% viable) were plated at 3 3 104 cells/well
in 24-well plates in complete medium without antibiotics and allowed to reach 60% confluence. They
were then transfected in triplicate for each treatment

group with 100 mL of 100 nM GABAB-R1 Stealth
RNAI (Invitrogen, La Jolla, Calif) or GABAB-R1 cDNA
complexed with 2 mg/mL Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After a 24-hour incubation in a humidified
incubator (5% CO2, 378C), transfection efficiency,
transfection toxicity, and percent of transfected cells
were determined (Block-iT Alexa Fluor Red Fluorescent Control, dead cell stain ethidium homodimer-1,
Nuclear stain Hoechst 33,342, Invitrogen). The
growth medium was then replaced by basal medium
without additives and responses to isoproterenol and
GABA assessed in untransfected cells versus cells
transiently overexpressing the GABABR or cells with
GABABR knockdown using the ERK1/2 activation
assay described below. Negative Stealth RNAi provided by the vendor served as negative control.

ERK1/2 Activation Assays12
This assay takes advantage of the finding that ELK-1
is a downstream effector of activated ERK1/2. Equal
amounts of protein were incubated overnight with 15
mL of agarose hydrazide beads immobilized p44 of
42 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Immune
precipitates were washed 3 times in 100 mM Tris
(pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate; once in 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 M lithium
chloride; and once in kinase buffer (12.5 mM MOPS,
pH 7.5, 12.5 mM b-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mM
MgCl2). Proteins were incubated for 20 minutes at
308C in a 30-mL kinase reaction containing 2 mg
ELK-1 fusion protein (GST-ELK-1 codons 307–428;
Cell Signaling), and 10 mM ATP. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes,
and probed with anti-phospho ELK (Ser383) antibody. After incubation with the secondary antibody,
bands were observed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. The density of p-ELK-1 and ERK1/2
protein bands was quantified by densitometry (4
densitometric readings per band using NIH Scion
Image analysis software). The ratios of p-ELK-1/ERK
were statistically analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test.
Immunohistochemistry
To provide in vivo evidence for a potential role of
cAMP-mediated and GABA signaling in the regulation of human pancreatic cancer, slides from human
tissue arrays (US Biomax, Rockville, Md) were used.
Microarray PA242 contained sections of 24 human
PDACS and 4 normal unrelated pancreatic tissues.
Microarray PA241 contained sections from 6 additional PDACs with matched normal tissues 1.5 cm
away from tumor. The sections were deparaffinized

in xylene, washed with PBS (pH 7.4), and incubated
with 3% hydrogen peroxide in 50% methanol for
20 minutes at room temperature. Incubations with
protein block solution, primary and biotinylated secondary antibodies, and diaminobenzidine substrate
were conducted with reagents provided by the universal Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) according to instructions with the kit.
Incubations with primary polyclonal antibodies (Chemicon Millipore, Billerica, MA) to mammalian GABA
(1:1000), human norepinephrine (1:1000), or human
PKARIIa (1:1000; BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif),
which recognizes the regulatory RIIa subunit when it
has been released from the PKA subunit complex
upon binding of cAMP,28 were conducted at 48C overnight in a humid chamber. Tissue slides processed
without exposure to primary antibodies served as negative controls and showed no detectable immunoreactivity. Hematoxylin was used as counterstain.

RESULTS
In accordance with our earlier publications,8,11,23 the
beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol caused a highly
significant (P < .001) increase in intracellular cAMP
in the pancreatic duct epithelial cells and in both
PDAC cell lines (Fig. 1). This response was comple-

(P < .001) increased intracellular cAMP levels in the human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines PANC-1 and BXPC-3 in immortalized

physiological agonist for all g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, GABA
(30 lM), or with the selective agonists for GABABRs, baclofen (30 lM) completely abrogated this response. Data are mean values and standard errors

FIGURE 3. Isoproterenol (10 nM) significantly (P < .001) induced DNA

completely inhibited by preexposure to g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (30 lM)
or baclofen (30 lM). Both agents also significantly (P < .001) suppressed
DNA synthesis below control levels. Data are mean values and standard

p-ELK-1 induction by isoproterenol were completely blocked by transient
GABABR knockdown (lane 4), whereas transient overexpression of GABABR
significantly (P < .001) enhanced these inhibitory actions of GABA (lane 5).

tely abrogated (P < .001) by preincubation with
GABA, which is an agonist for all GABA receptors
(Fig. 1). Preincubation of the cells with the selective
agonist for GABABRs baclofen similarly blocked the
responses of all 3 cell lines to isoproterenol (P < .001;
Fig. 1), suggesting involvement of the GABABR in the
observed inhibition. Exposure of unstimulated pancreatic duct or PDAC cells to GABA or baclofen significantly (P < .001) reduced base levels of cAMP
below that of control cells (Fig. 1).
We have previously shown that b-AR-induced
cAMP activates the ERK1/2 cascade via transactivation of EGFR in a PKA-dependent manner in human
pancreatic duct epithelial cells and that the resulting
activation of ERK1/2 serves as a major mitogenic
stimulus.11 In the current study we therefore used an
ERK1/2 kinase reaction and Western blot in anti-pERK1/2 immunoprecipitates of p-ELK-1 protein

phosphorylated by activated ERK1/2 to assess the
modulating effects of GABABR on ispoproterenolevoked mitogenic signaling in these cells. Our data
show that isoproterenol caused a significant
(P < .001) increase in p-ELK-1 protein (Fig. 2, lane 2),
a response significantly (P < .001) reduced by preincubation with GABA (Fig. 2, lane 3). Preincubation
with GABA failed to reduce isoproterenol-induction
of p-ELK-1 in cells with GABABR1 knockdown by
transient transfection with GABABR1 stealth RNAi
(P < .001; Fig. 2, lane 4). Conversely, overexpression
of the GABABR1 by transient transfection of GABABR1
cDNA reduced (P < .001) isoproterenol-induced pELK-1 below control levels in cells preincubated with
GABA (Fig. 2, lane 5). The inhibitory effects of GABA
in cells overexpressing GABABR1 were significantly
(P < .001) greater than in cells without GABABR1
overexpression (compare lanes 5 and 3 in Fig. 2).
Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that activation of GABABR may inhibit mitogenic signaling in
response to b-AR stimulation in pancreatic duct
epithelial cells and the cancers derived from them.
This interpretation is supported by the results generated by BrdU incorporation assays that monitored
modulation of DNA synthesis in pancreatic duct
epithelial cells HPDE6-C7 and the 2 PDAC cell lines
PANC-1 and BXPC-3. As Figure 3 shows, isoproterenol strongly (P < .001) induced DNA synthesis in all
3 cell lines. Preincubation with GABA or baclofen

each significantly (P < .001) reduced the response
below base levels observed in the controls. In addition, both agents significantly (P < .001) reduced
base level DNA synthesis in unstimulated cells from
each of the 3 cell lines (Fig. 3).
The high mortality rate of pancreatic cancer is
caused by the aggressive behavior of this malignancy,
resulting in extensive invasiveness and metastasis.
We therefore assessed the effects of b-AR stimulation
on the migration of PDAC cells and the potential
modulation of this response by GABA and baclofen.
As Figures 4 and 5 show, both PDAC cell lines
demonstrated a highly significant (P < .001) increase
in cell migration when treated with isoproterenol. In
both cell lines this response was suppressed below
control levels (P < .001) by preincubation with GABA
or baclofen. In addition, the migration of cells not
stimulated by isoproterenol was significantly (P <

.001) reduced by each of these GABA-ergic agents
(Figs. 4, 5). These data suggest, for the first time, that
beta-adrenergic signaling increases the invasiveness
and metastatic potential of PDAC and that activation
of the GABABR by agonists may serve as a valuable
tool to suppress this aggressive behavior.
Our in vitro data suggest an important role of
cAMP/PKA-mediated signaling in the aggressive
behavior of PDAC while indicating that activation of
GABA signaling could be useful for the prevention
and treatment of this malignancy. However, there is
no published evidence to date that identifies adrenergic agonists in the tumor environment of human
PDAC or indicates hyperactivity of cAMP-mediated
signaling in these tumor cells. Similarly, there are no
reports on GABA levels in human PDAC. Our immunohistochemical data generated in human PDAC tis-

sue arrays show low but detectable levels of the
physiological agonist for b-ARs, norepinephrine, in
all normal tumor adjacent (Fig. 6A) and unrelated
tissues, whereas norepinephrine was overexpressed
in all tumor tissues (Fig. 6B). In addition, we
observed a strong overexpression of PKARIIa that is
released from the PKA subunit complex upon binding of cAMP in all PDAC samples (Fig. 7B) as compared with normal tumor adjacent (Fig. 7A) and
unrelated pancreatic tissues. This finding suggests
hyperactivity of cAMP/PKA signaling in PDAC. By
contrast, positive immunoreactivity to GABA was
below detectable levels under the conditions used in
29 of the 30 investigated PDAC samples (Fig. 8B),
whereas each of the adjacent tumors (Fig. 8A) and
unrelated normal pancreatic tissues showed strong
positive immunoreactivity to GABA. These findings
are suggestive of a pronounced underexpression of
GABA in most human PDACs.

DISCUSSION
This is the first report that implicates GABABR as a
target for the prevention and therapy of PDAC. Our
data show that this receptor, which inhibits adenylyl
cyclase by activating Gaii,24 acts as a powerful control for cAMP-dependent signaling, including the
transactivated EGFR-mediated ERK1/2 cascade, that
drive the proliferation and migration of PDAC. Unlike
therapeutics that block only individual downstream
components of this signaling network, agonists for
GABABR act as the ‘‘physiological brake’’ to counterbalance the entire cAMP-driven stimulatory signaling
network activated by cell surface receptors coupled
to the stimulatory G-protein Gas. As our current and
published8,9,11,23 data suggest, among the family of
Gas-coupled receptors that are counterbalanced by
the GABABR, b-ARs play a prominent role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Recent studies by other laboratories have also implicated b-ARs as important
mediators of cancer growth and/or invasiveness in
adenocarcinoma of the lungs,12,29,30 prostate,16 colon,15 stomach,19 breast,17 and ovary.20 In addition, it
has been shown that GABA and baclofen inhibit bAR-mediated migration of breast cancer cells17 and
colon cancer cells.31 Accordingly, GABABR may be a
promising target for the prevention and treatment of
all of these cancers.
Intracellular cAMP can be increased by the activation of numerous Gas-coupled receptors, by activators of adenylyl cyclase or cAMP, as well as
phosphodiesterase inhibitors. All of these factors
could contribute to pancreatic carcinogenesis. The
more pronounced overexpression of PKARII than nor-

epinephrine in PDACs detected by us suggest that
cAMP stimulators in addition to b-AR agonists may
contribute to this response.
The 3 known risk factors for PDAC, smoking, diabetes, and pancreatitis, disturb the balance between
stimulatory b-adrenergic signaling and inhibitory
GABABR signaling in the pancreas. A classic biological effect of nicotine is the enhanced release of the
stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine,10,32 resulting in increased stimulation of b-ARs.
b-ARs in smokers are in addition stimulated by the
nicotine-derived carcinogenic nitrosamine NNK that
acts as a high-affinity agonist for these receptors.8,29
Conversely, diabetes and pancreatitis are associated
with the loss of pancreatic islet beta cells, the major
source of inhibitory GABA in the pancreas.24 It
stands to reason that a patient diagnosed with PDAC,
a malignancy with an extremely poor prognosis, will
suffer extreme anxiety. In turn, anxiety has been
shown to increase the sensitivity of b-ARs to agonists.33 In addition, any kind of stress, including anxiety, causes the release of the physiological agonists
for b-ARs, norepinephrine and epinephrine, from the
sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla, increasing their systemic levels.34 Increased
systemic levels of norepinephrine have also been
reported as a response to gastrointestinal cancer surgery.35,36 While these stress responses are not unique
to pancreatic cancer, they have the potential to contribute to the poor prognosis of this malignancy. The
overexpression of norepinephrine in the cancer cells
suggest up-regulation of the b-ARs that mediate its
uptake.
GABA was below detectable levels in 29 of 30
human PDAC samples investigated, whereas each of
the adjacent tumors and unrelated normal pancreatic
tissue samples demonstrated pronounced positive
immunoreactivity to GABA. In accordance with its
function in the regulation of secretion by pancreatic
duct epithelia,37 acinar cells,38 and islet cells,39 norepinephrine was expressed in all normal and cancerous
pancreatic tissues. While positive immunoreactivity to
norepinephrine was higher in cancer cells than in normal cells, PKARIIa that is released from the PKA subunit complex upon activation of PKA by cAMP28
demonstrated a more pronounced overexpression in
the cancer cells of each PDAC sample. These findings
suggest that the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signaling in the human pancreatic cancer
samples was significantly shifted in favor of stimulatory cAMP/PKA signaling. In addition, the marked
underexpression of GABA in the human PDACs in
conjunction with our in vitro data suggest GABA as a
novel type of tumor suppressor for PDAC.

GABAB Signaling in Pancreatic CA/Schuller et al.

GABA and baclofen are FDA-approved for the
treatment of anxiety. In addition, GABA is widely
used as a dietary supplement to ease anxiety and
promote sleep. Our data suggest that the use of these
GABA-ergic agents as adjuvants to standard cancer
therapy may have significant beneficial effects on
the outcome of pancreatic cancer by inhibiting the
proliferation and migration of cancer cells. In
addition, the regular intake of GABA as a dietary supplement may significantly reduce the risk for the development of PDAC in individuals with diabetes and
pancreatitis.
It is intriguing that GABA is a natural product of
plants that mediates communication between plants
and other organisms40 and participates in the plants’
defenses against stress, wounding, and attack by
parasites and microbes.41 Significant levels of GABA
have been reported in grape berries and the Merlot
wine made from them,42 in tomatoes,40 and in soy.43
These natural products also have significant cancer
preventive activities.44,45 While research into the
mechanisms of action of these and other plantderived cancer preventive agents have focused on
their antioxidant effects and inhibition of carcinogen
metabolism,45 our data suggest that inhibition of
Gas-mediated signaling by GABA may be a novel and
hitherto unexplored mechanism of action of some
plants with cancer preventive activity.
