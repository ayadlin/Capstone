BACKGROUND: Impaired cardiac function in doxorubicin-treated childhood cancer survivors is partly mediated by the disruption of
mitochondrial energy production. Doxorubicin intercalates into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and disrupts genes encoding for polypeptides that make adenosine triphosphate. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined mtDNA copy numbers per cell and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 64 childhood survivors of high-risk acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had been treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute childhood ALL protocols and had received doxorubicin alone (42%) or doxorubicin with the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane (58%). The number of mtDNA copies per cell and the
OXPHOS enzyme activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (complex I [CI]) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex
IV [CIV]) were measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction immunoassays and thin-layer chromatography,
respectively. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 7.8 years after treatment, the median number of mtDNA copies per cell for patients
treated with doxorubicin alone (1106.3) was significantly higher than the median number for those who had also received dexrazoxane (310.5; P 5.001). No significant differences were detected between the groups for CI or CIV activity. CONCLUSIONS: Doxorubicintreated survivors had an increased number of PBMC mtDNA copies per cell, and concomitant use of dexrazoxane was associated
with a lower number of mtDNA copies per cell. Because of a possible compensatory increase in mtDNA copies per cell to maintain
mitochondrial function in the setting of mitochondrial dysfunction, overall OXPHOS activity was not different between the groups.

INTRODUCTION
Childhood cancer survival rates have improved dramatically over recent decades. The 5-year event-free survival rate for
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 2011 was 82%, a significant improvement from the rate of <50% in
the 1970s.1 Much of this success can be attributed to the wide use of doxorubicin, a highly effective anthracycline. However, long-term follow-up studies of this growing population have revealed that doxorubicin treatment is associated with
late cardiac effects years later.2-10
Doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity can occur both during and years after therapy and can progress from asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction to cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and, in some cases, the need for heart transplantation or cardiac death.7,9,11,12 Identifying patient risk factors such as female sex, the cumulative dose and dose rate of
anthracycline, trisomy 21, a younger age at diagnosis, black race, prior and concomitant cardiotoxic therapy, a preexisting
risk for developing cardiovascular disease or identified cardiovascular disease, and increasing time since cancer treatment
has helped to characterize those at higher risk for these anthracycline-associated late cardiac effects,5,13-17 although the predisposition to cardiac damage varies substantially among individuals.

mtDNA Function in Childhood Cancer Survivors/Lipshultz et al

Recent evidence suggests that doxorubicin-associated
cardiotoxicity is at least partially due to the generation of
semiquinone free radicals by doxorubicin-iron complexes
in the myocardium. Furthermore, one animal study found
a dose-dependent increase of doxorubicin in mitochondria, and this indicates that doxorubicin accumulates in
the mitochondria and leads to an increase in mitochondrial iron levels.18 The reaction of these free radicals with
oxygen (reactive oxygen species) leads to lipid peroxidation and ultimately DNA damage.19-22 Dexrazoxane, a
cardioprotectant, chelates iron; it thereby hinders iron
from forming doxorubicin-iron complexes and, as a result,
lowers free-radical DNA damage.23
Mitochondria contain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
which is separate from nuclear DNA and encodes 13 polypeptides of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Preclinical studies have associated doxorubicin exposure with
irreversible cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction,24-26 clinical histological studies have observed doxorubicin-related
structural abnormalities, and one recent study of childhood ALL survivors found that gene polymorphisms of
mitochondrial expression may affect mtDNA replication
and possibly indicate susceptibility to doxorubicin.27 We
have found that doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors
of childhood ALL have significantly more mtDNA mutations or polymorphisms than healthy children.28 Our
findings are similar to what has been observed in murine
late doxorubicin cardiotoxicity: increased peripheral
blood lymphocytes contain mitochondrial mutations that
are related to respiratory chain defects and late-onset cardiomyopathy.29 These studies demonstrate that doxorubicin has deleterious effects on mitochondrial structure
and DNA, which could affect mtDNA copy numbers and
OXPHOS.
Furthermore, preclinical studies of anthracycline exposure in mitochondria have shown disruption of
OXPHOS, particularly in the OXPHOS enzyme activity
of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase (complex I [CI]) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV [CIV]),30,31 as well as changes in mtDNA in the
form of mutations, deletions, and reduced copy numbers
per cell in heart tissue.32,33 If the mitochondria of
doxorubicin-exposed cancer survivors are indeed impaired
through either DNA intercalation or oxidative stress, they
may undergo clonal expansion of their mtDNA to compensate for mutations or deletions that could lead to normal OXPHOS and adenosine triphosphate production34
in the myocardium. Studies in rats treated with dexrazoxane and doxorubicin demonstrated that concomitant
dexrazoxane treatment prevented doxorubicin-induced

cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction by maintaining
OXPHOS activities and mtDNA integrity.32,35
Therefore, we examined mtDNA and OXPHOS
enzyme activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) in childhood survivors of high-risk ALL who
received doxorubicin alone or dexrazoxane with doxorubicin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

After institutional review board approval, patients were
enrolled in Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL consortium protocol 05-336 if they met all of the following eligibility criteria: they had been previously diagnosed with
ALL and treated with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute childhood ALL protocols, they had no prior relapse (ie, they
were in their first complete remission), and they had no
prior allogeneic stem cell transplant. For this crosssectional study, only high-risk ALL patients were
included, and additional inclusion criteria were established: patients had to have been diagnosed with high-risk
ALL at least 4 years before, and they did not have a history
of secondary malignancies treated with chemotherapy or
radiation. Informed consent was obtained from patients
who were older than 18 years or from parents of patients
who were 18 years old or younger. The total planned cumulative doxorubicin dosage for high-risk ALL patients
was 300 to 360 mg/m2. All patients received doxorubicin
alone or doxorubicin plus dexrazoxane.
Sample Collection

Peripheral blood was collected at the time of enrollment.
All samples were shipped overnight at room temperature
to a central processing laboratory. Whole blood was
diluted 1:1 with a basic medium of saline/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were centrifuged in a lymphocyte separation solution (Organon Biosciences, Kenilworth,
NJ), and the mononuclear cell layer was isolated and washed
twice with 2 volumes of PBS. Cell samples were enumerated
and adjusted with PBS to achieve a concentration of
1 3 106 cells/mL and were again centrifuged and aspirated.
The resulting mononuclear cells, constituting primarily
lymphocytes, were cryopreserved by freezing at –70 8C until
mtDNA isolation and analysis. All samples were processed
within 30 hours of collection.
PBMC Isolation

Blood samples were drawn into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and heparin-containing vacutainers at each study
site. PBMCs were isolated within 8 hours via a Ficoll gradient (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wis), and platelets
947

were removed by 2 PBS washes and centrifugation at a relative centrifugal force of 300. The PBMCs were then pelleted and frozen at –80 8C.
Acquisition of mtDNA Copy Numbers and
OXPHOS Activity

PBMC mtDNA copies per cell were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. DNA was
extracted from frozen PBMCs with a Qiagen DNA kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). Standardization of real-time
polymerase chain reaction was performed with LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I with the Roche
LightCycler instrument (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind). A
dilution series of the control plasmid containing the 90–
base pair mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and
the 98–base pair Fas ligand gene was prepared to set up
the standard. Each sample and standard were run in a
duplicate 20-mL reaction mixture. At the conclusion of
the polymerase chain reaction, a melt curve analysis was
started at 65 8C, and the temperature was increased half a
degree every 30 seconds for 60 cycles. The results were analyzed with LightCycler software (version 4.0).36
CI and CIV were measured with immunoassays and
thin-layer chromatography, respectively. Each vial of viable PBMCs was thawed and washed in 0.5 mL of PBS
twice before the addition of 0.5 mL of an ice-cold extraction buffer (1.5% lauryl maltoside, 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic acid [pH 7.4],
100 mM sodium chloride, and protease inhibitors [P8340; Sigma]). Samples were mixed gently and kept on
ice for 20 minutes, and then they were spun in a microcentrifuge at 16,400 rpm and 4 8C for 20 minutes to
remove insoluble cell debris. The supernatant, an extract
of detergent-solubilized cellular proteins, was then assayed
with OXPHOS dipstick assays. All samples were loaded
onto dipsticks with equal amounts of total cell protein or
enzyme activity; an amount previously established with
control samples was used to generate signals within the
linear range of the assay. Therefore, the resulting dipstick
signals were directly proportional to the amount of
OXPHOS protein or enzyme activity in the sample.
Quantitation of dipstick signals was performed with densitometric scanning.36 OXPHOS CI and CIV were specifically measured because they are the beginning and end of
the electron transport chain and are partially encoded by
mtDNA. Furthermore, preclinical studies of anthracycline exposure observed disrupted OXPHOS, particularly
in CI and CIV, in heart tissue.30,31 We expected that any
disturbances in OXPHOS would be measurable at these
complexes.
948

Statistical Analysis

A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous measures between treatment groups. A multiple linear
regression model for each continuous outcome measure
(PBMC mtDNA copy number and CI and CIV enzyme
activity measures) was constructed to test for differences
between treatment groups while adjustments were made
for patient and sample characteristics, including the age at
study registration (<10 vs  10 years), sex, T-cell immunophenotype, initial white blood cell count, and red
blood cell contamination. The cumulative doxorubicin
dose was also included in the modeling for a subset of the
data; those patients dosed on the basis of milligrams per
kilogram were excluded. Because of the skewness of the
distributions, the values for the mtDNA copy number
and CI and CIV enzyme activities were log10-transformed
before modeling. All analyses were performed with SAS
9.2. P values were 2-sided and were considered significant
at the .05 level.
RESULTS
Sixty-four patients provided samples at a median of 7.8
years (range, 2.9-30.2 years) after doxorubicin treatment
(Table 1). The median cumulative dose of doxorubicin
was 300 mg/m2 (120-382 mg/m2), and 37 patients (58%)
received concomitant dexrazoxane.
In a univariate analysis, a significant difference was
detected in the mtDNA copy number between patients
who received doxorubicin only (median, 1106.3 copies
per cell; range, 144.2-6746.8 copies per cell) and those
who also received dexrazoxane (310.5 copies per cell;
15.3-1859.2 copies per cell; P 5 .001; Fig. 1). No significant differences were found between treatment groups in
CI or CIV enzyme activities (Table 2). However, the median CI activity was significantly higher for males (12.6
optical density [OD]/lg 3 103; n 5 31; range, 5-41.4
OD/lg 3 103) versus females (6.7 OD/lg 3 103;
n 5 27; range, 5.0-27.7 OD/lg 3 103; P 5 .037), but
this was not true for CIV. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the number of mtDNA copies per cell
between girls and boys.
In a regression analysis, treatment remained associated with mtDNA copy numbers after adjustments for
age, sex, T-cell immunophenotype, red blood cell contamination, and initial white blood cell count cell count
(P 5 .001; Table 3). No other covariates were significant
in the modeling. When we considered a model including
the cumulative dose of doxorubicin for the subset of
patients dosed on the basis of milligrams per meter
squared (n 5 48) and adjusted for the same covariates, the

not shown). Drug treatment was not associated with CI or
CIV enzyme activities. However, sex remained associated
with CI enzyme activity (P 5 .03; model not shown).
In a subset analysis of each treatment group, the sex
difference was present only in the doxorubicin plus dexrazoxane group (median, 16.4 OD/lg 3 103 for males vs
5.3 OD/lg 3 103 for females; P 5 .007); it was not present in the doxorubicin-alone group (median, 9.8 OD/

P 5 .85).
DISCUSSION
In this study, after a median of 7 years since the completion of doxorubicin treatment, survivors of childhood
high-risk ALL treated with doxorubicin alone had 3 times
the number of mtDNA copies per cell in PBMCs in comparison with children treated with doxorubicin plus dexrazoxane, but OXPHOS enzyme activities did not differ
between the groups. In addition, mtDNA copies per cell
in those who received dexrazoxane were within the normal
ranges observed in our previous studies (100-350 copies
per cell).36,37

with iron, and induces oxidative stress; this then leads to
lipid peroxidation and DNA damage.18-22 In addition,
elevated oxidative stress is associated with a higher number of mtDNA copies per cell in aging tissue.34 Dexrazoxane protects the mitochondria by chelating the iron and
preventing the formation of the doxorubicin-iron complex.38 Also, in vitro dexrazoxane antagonizes
doxorubicin-induced DNA damage in H9C2 cardiomyocytes through its interference with DNA topoisomerase
II; this could implicate this topoisomerase in doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity.39 In vivo mouse studies with a
cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of DNA topoisomerase II
prevented mice from developing doxorubicin progressive
heart failure, whereas in control mice treated with doxorubicin, the genes involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function were decreased.40 Together,
this might explain why those who were treated with doxorubicin alone had a higher number of mtDNA copies
per cell than those who received dexrazoxane before each
doxorubicin dose. This may reflect doxorubicinassociated accelerated mitochondrial aging.
Although a decrease in OXPHOS enzyme activity
might be expected because of impaired mitochondrial
function, this was not the case in our study. As with aging
tissue, we suspect that doxorubicin-exposed mitochondria
may undergo clonal expansion to compensate for
doxorubicin-induced mtDNA deletions or mutations to
maintain OXPHOS and adenosine triphosphate production.34 A similar compensatory mechanism was seen in a
study of adults with Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy,

an inherited blinding disease caused by homoplasmic
point mutations in the CI subunit genes of mtDNA,
which are part of the same NADH dehydrogenase subunit
examined in our study. This study showed that unaffected
carriers of the mutation had a higher mtDNA copy number than their affected relatives and controls.41 This would
result in normal transcription levels of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit, which would result in normal
OXPHOS enzyme activity for this enzyme. The authors
postulated that a higher mtDNA copy number per cell in
carriers might override some of the pathogenic effects of
mtDNA mutations.41
Lebrecht et al29 found that doxorubicin-exposed rats
had more mtDNA mutations and deletions and a lower
number of mtDNA copies per cell in cardiac tissue in
comparison with controls only a few weeks after the last
doxorubicin exposure. It is possible that the number of
mtDNA copies per cell may have been lower in our
patients initially after doxorubicin treatment and then
later increased through clonal expansion to maintain
steady OXPHOS levels. However, this hypothesis cannot
be confirmed because we did not measure mtDNA mutations, deletions, or copies per cell immediately after treatment or serially after the completion of doxorubicin
therapy.
950

This study has limitations. First, studies examining
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity typically use cardiac
tissue to measure mitochondrial function; however, we
examined systemic changes in PBMC mitochondria
because acquiring cardiac mitochondria is invasive and
unethical. Yet, systemic mitochondrial pathologies have
been shown to correlate in PBMCs and in the tissues of
interest37,42; therefore, it is possible that what we observed
in PBMC mitochondria may reflect what is occurring in
cardiomyocyte mitochondria. Furthermore, the transcriptome in doxorubicin-exposed cardiac cells has been shown
to be highly similar in the gene expression profiles to those
in PBMCs, and this suggests that the PBMC transcriptome might serve as a surrogate marker of doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity.43 However, further study is
warranted in this area. Second, it is possible that the high
number of mtDNA copies in the doxorubicin group was
due to greater numbers of mitochondria present in the
PBMCs. Lebrecht et al29 found higher activity of citrate
synthase, a marker for mitochondrial numbers, in cardiac
cells of doxorubicin-treated rats versus controls. An assay
measuring the mitochondrial protein citrate synthase or
porin would have indicated whether there were increased
numbers of mitochondria in the PBMCs of our patients,
but further samples were not available for testing. Future
research should examine the number of mitochondria as
well as the number of mtDNA copies. Lastly, we did not
have sufficient echocardiograms taken at the same time as
the samples to determine LV function. However, the
patients enrolled in this study were sampled from a larger
cohort for which LV function was examined after doxorubicin alone or dexrazoxane with doxorubicin treatment.44
Although the effects of dexrazoxane on LV function were
mild and more significant in the females, generally, there
was an improvement in cardiac outcomes.44
A recent study supports the importance of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain as a target for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. This study described a previously unidentified cardiomyocyte signaling pathway that couples
doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial respiratory chain
defects and necrotic cell death in a mutually dependent

and obligatory link to the BH3-only protein Bcl-2–like
19 kDa-interacting protein 3 (Bnip3). Mitochondrial
localization of Bnip3, increased reactive oxygen species
production, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening resulting in doxorubicin-induced contractile failure
and necrotic cell death were associated with cardiomyocyte vacuolization and disrupted mitochondria in an acute
injury model that did not examine late effects. Interventions that antagonize Bnip3 appear beneficial in preventing doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial injury and heart
failure.45
Overall, this is the first long-term study of pediatric
high-risk ALL survivors to show that doxorubicin therapy
affects mtDNA numbers and that concomitant dexrazoxane therapy improves mtDNA copies per cell; this was at a
median of 7 years after the completion of doxorubicin
treatment with a median cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2.
This supports the evidence that dexrazoxane adjuvant
therapy in pediatric high-risk ALL patients offers systemic
mitochondrial protection as observed in PBMCs in addition to the already documented cardioprotection seen in
the same patient population from the measurement of cardiac biomarkers of myocardial injury during doxorubicin
therapy (serum cardiac troponin T) and cardiomyocyte
stress during therapy (N-terminal pro brain natriuretic
peptide)23,46 and from the assessment of LV structure and
function by echocardiography in long-term survivors.44
The increase in the number of mtDNA copies per cell to
maintain mitochondrial function is likely compensatory
in the setting of mitochondrial dysfunction. However,
overall OXPHOS activity was not different between
the groups.
The sex differences in CI OXPHOS activity
observed in our study may help to explain how dexrazoxane affects girls and boys differently. Girls have greater
doxorubicin cardiotoxicity than boys as long-term survivors of childhood cancer.15 Girls also derive greater doxorubicin cardioprotection than boys when they are treated
with dexrazoxane for ALL.44 These sex differences suggest
that there are differences in both mitochondrial and freeradical injury protective mechanisms similar to what has
been found in preclinical doxorubicin studies, in which
these pathways have been found to be important
targets for cardiotoxicity.21,25,26 The importance of adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette transporter and endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene mutations to the
development of late cardiotoxicity in long-term survivors
of doxorubicin-treated ALL was recently noted,47 and this
further supports the importance of mitochondrial and

oxidative stress as targets. In that study, abnormal mitochondrial function after doxorubicin therapy might have
been related to late depressed LV contractility and disturbed cardiac growth.47 This suggests the importance of
both mitochondrial function and free-radical pathways in
the development of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Similarly,
the doxorubicin cardiotoxicity free-radical damage hypothesis is supported by the presence of hemochromatosis
gene mutations, which result in more iron and free-radical
formation by the coupling of iron with doxorubicin and
are associated with more dead and dying cardiomyocytes
during doxorubicin therapy for childhood ALL and with
more persistent echocardiographic abnormalities years
later.48 These findings support the possible role of dexrazoxane before anthracycline therapy in protecting mitochondrial function in other healthy tissues such as the
ovaries.49 We have further reported that the use of
dexrazoxane before every doxorubicin dose resulted in less
late cardiotoxicity for children treated for T-cell ALL50,
that its use in pediatric patients with osteosarcoma
allowed dose escalation of doxorubicin to 600 mg/m2
without evidence of cardiotoxicity51, and that its use
in osteosarcoma prevented the additive cardiotoxicity
associated with the concurrent use of doxorubicin and
trastuzumab52.
Additional follow-up is needed to determine
whether this compensatory mechanism could eventually
become insufficient for maintaining OXPHOS activity in
the longer term.
