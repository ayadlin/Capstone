Abstract

$watermark-text

Ezrin is a multifunctional protein that connects the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix
through transmembrane proteins. High ezrin expression is associated with lung metastasis and
poor survival in cancer. We screened small molecule libraries for compounds that directly interact
with ezrin protein using surface plasmon resonance to identify lead compounds. The secondary
functional assays used for lead compound selection included ezrin phosphorylation as measured
by immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays, actin binding, chemotaxis, invasion into an
endothelial cell monolayer, zebrafish and Xenopus embryonic development, mouse lung organ
culture and an in vivo lung metastasis model. Two molecules, NSC305787 and NSC668394, that
directly bind to ezrin with low micromolar affinity were selected based on inhibition of ezrin
function in multiple assays. They inhibited ezrin phosphorylation, ezrin–actin interaction and
ezrin-mediated motility of osteosarcoma (OS) cells in culture. NSC305787 mimicked the ezrin
morpholino phenotype, and NSC668394 caused a unique developmental defect consistent with
reduced cell motility in zebrafish. Following tail vein injection of OS cells into mice, both
molecules inhibited lung metastasis of ezrinsensitive cells, but not ezrin-resistant cells. The small
molecule inhibitors NSC305787 and NSC668394 demonstrate a novel targeted therapy that
directly inhibits ezrin protein as an approach to prevent tumor metastasis.

Introduction
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer type in children and
adolescents (Longhi et al., 2006). Its underlying pathogenesis has been difficult to establish
because of its heterogeneous histology and complex etiology. Historically, patients with

only localized disease have been treated with surgery alone, resulting in a 20% survival rate
due to undetected micrometastasis likely present at diagnosis. Treatment of localized disease
has improved with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which has increased the 5-year survival to
60–70%. However, the 5-year survival of patients with metastasis is still only 30% (Rosen et
al., 1982; Bacci et al., 2006; Ferrari and Palmerini, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008). In OS, the
predominant recurrence site is the lung and the main cause of OS patient death is pulmonary
metastasis (Dunn and Dehner, 1977). Targeting the underlying molecular events that cause
metastasis could provide dramatic benefits for the treatment of OS patients.

Ezrin, an ***ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family member, is evolutionarily conserved both
structurally and functionally (Fievet et al., 2007). By regulating membrane-cytoskeleton
complexes, ezrin has key roles in normal cellular processes such as maintenance of
membrane dynamics, survival, adhesion, motility, cytokinesis, phagocytosis and integration
of membrane transport with signaling pathways (Bretscher et al., 2002). Ezrin function is
actively regulated by its conformational changes (Fievet et al., 2007). Ezrin exists in an
inactive conformation, in which the membrane and actin-binding sites are masked by
intramolecular interaction of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Gary and Bretscher,
1995). In its active open conformation, ezrin functions as a crosslinker between the plasma
membrane and cortical cytoskeleton. Two factors are involved in this conformational
transition: binding of the N-terminal domain to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate and
phosphorylation of a conserved threonine at residue 567 (T567) in the F-actin-binding site
(Fievet et al., 2007). Several serine/threonine kinases, Rho kinase, protein kinase C-alpha
(PKCα) and iota (PKCΙ), and MST4 are important for T567 phosphorylation (Matsui et al.,
1998; Ren et al., 2009; Ten Klooster et al., 2009). Ezrin exhibits no intrinsic enzymatic
activity and exerts its biological functions through protein–protein interactions. In its active
form, ezrin can interact with membrane proteins either directly or through adapter proteins.
It binds directly to adhesion-related proteins with single transmembrane domains such as
CD43, CD44, CD95, ICAM-1, -2, -3 and PA2.26 antigen through their cytoplasmic tails
(Louvet-Vallee, 2000), and this binding modulates cell motility and morphology (Legg and
Isacke, 1998). Ezrin binding to adapter proteins such as EBP50/NHE-RF and E3KARP
regulates the activity of ion transporters, endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins and
interaction of F-actin to specific plasma membrane domains (Bretscher et al., 2002). In
addition to plasma membrane proteins, ezrin associates with cytoplasmic signaling proteins
and is involved in several signaling pathways, such as Rho and PI3K/Akt pathways (Hirao et
al., 1996; Gautreau et al., 1999).

In an OS mouse model, high ezrin expression is linked to pulmonary metastasis, providing
an early survival advantage for cancer cells reaching the lung (Khanna et al., 2004). Higher
expression of ezrin correlates with poor prognosis in both canine and human OS.
Comparison of ezrin expression in high- and low-grade human OS tumor samples revealed a
clear correlation between ezrin expression and survival (Park et al., 2006). In addition to OS,
ezrin has been associated with tumor progression, metastatic spread and poor clinical
outcome in several other cancers, including breast, colon, malignant melanoma, ovarian
carcinoma, brain tumors and soft tissue sarcomas (Geiger et al., 2000; Makitie et al., 2001;
Elliott et al., 2005; Weng et al., 2005; Kobel et al., 2006; Elzagheid et al., 2008).
Consequently, suppression of ezrin expression in experimental models results in reduced
metastasis (Makitie et al., 2001; Khanna et al., 2004; Pang et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004).
In summary, accumulating evidence from experimental mouse models, as well as canine and
human patients, validates ezrin as a key factor in cancer cell invasion and survival at
metastatic sites. In the present study, we identified two small molecules, NSC305787 and
NSC668394, which directly interact with ezrin and inhibit its function in multiple assays.

Results
Initial screening of small molecules for direct binding to ezrin

$watermark-text

We hypothesized that small molecules that directly bind ezrin may inhibit its function and
can potentially be developed as anti-metastatic agents for human malignancies. We screened
small molecule libraries to identify compounds that directly bind to ezrin by expressing
wild-type (WT) recombinant ezrin in bacteria and purifying it by column chromatography
(Reczek et al., 1997). We prepared recombinant WT ezrin at 100 μg/ml (1.25 μM) with
>90% purity (Figure 1a). To validate that bacteria-purified, recombinant mouse ezrin has the
appropriate tertiary structure, we evaluated its actin-binding ability. Threonine
phosphorylation at amino acid residue 567 provides an open conformation of ezrin and
increases its actin-binding capacity. We used threonine (T) to aspartic acid (D) substitution
to mimic phosphorylation at this residue (Gautreau et al., 2000) and subsequently purified
WT and phosphomimicking mutant (T567D) forms of ezrin (Figure 1a). Actin binding of
these two constructs was evaluated by immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates from low-ezrinexpressing K12 OS cells were incubated with recombinant ezrin. Cellular actin coimmunoprecipitated with recombinant ezrin was detected by immunoblotting. Significantly
higher levels of actin bound to T567D ezrin than to WT ezrin (Figure 1b). We also observed
increased binding of T567D ezrin to purified actin in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (Supplementary Figure 1). These results suggested that at least a portion of
recombinant ezrin made in bacteria was folded properly to replicate the expected
mammalian structure.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) allows the measurement of direct molecular interactions
in real-time and in a label-free setting (Fivash et al., 1998; Malmqvist, 1999). We used SPR
to screen small molecule libraries for compounds that directly bind to recombinant WT
ezrin. Ezrin was immobilized on Biacore T100 sensorchips (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ,
USA), and small molecules were individually injected over the surface at a single
concentration. We screened 3081 small molecules from four libraries (Challenge Set,
Diversity Set, Mechanistic Set and Natural Product Set) provided by the Developmental
Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute. In this initial screen, any molecule
demonstrating meaningful binding to recombinant ezrin over background values was
selected as a primary hit. We then evaluated 65 primary hits in functional assays, which
identified two lead compounds, NSC305787 and NSC668394 (Figure 1c). Detailed SPR
analyses of the two compounds in five independent experiments yielded an average KD of
5.85 μM (±3.85 μM (standard deviation (s.d.))) for the affinity of NSC305787 (Figure 1d)
and 12.59 μM (±6.35 μM) for the affinity of NSC668394 (Figure 1e) binding to ezrin. KD
values of NSC305787 and NSC668394 binding to actin (used as a negative control) were
91.4 μM and 603 μM, respectively (data not shown). None of the 65 primary hits showed
differential binding between WT and T567D ezrin. We also performed molecular docking
studies to analyze the likely binding model of NSC305787 and NSC668394 with ezrin
(Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). Analyses of the simulated models suggest that the two
compounds are buried well inside the binding pockets of site 1 (H48, W58, Y85, Q105,
I115, Y201 and N204) and site 2 (W278, L274, F250, P272 and L281).
Secondary functional assays used for lead compound selection included ezrin
phosphorylation, actin binding, chemotaxis, invasion into an endothelial cell monolayer,
zebrafish and Xenopus embryonic development, mouse lung organ culture and an in vivo
lung metastasis model.
Additionally, druggability based on solubility, potential in vivo toxicity, chemical stability
and derivatization potential were considered for elimination of some primary hits. We used
Lipinski’s ‘Rule of Five’, which is a classic predictor of the potential ‘druggability’ of a

small molecule, based on its physico-chemical properties. These parameters include the
number of hydrogen bond donor and accepting groups present in the compound, the
molecular weight and the calculated partition coefficient. Both NSC305787 and NSC668394
possess a functionalized quinoline pharmacophore, a molecular framework prevalent in
clinical therapeutics. Computational analysis of both compounds with Chemdraw, SciFinder
and MolInspiration software programs revealed the predicted partition coefficient of 5.8 for
NSC305787 and 2.8 for NSC668394. Moreover, the molecular weights of 443 g/mol
(NSC305787) and 450 g/mol (NSC668394), as well as total number of hydrogen bond
accepting and donating moieties (three for NSC305787 and seven for NSC668394) were all
within delineated parameters of this methodology, demonstrating the therapeutic promise of
these scaffolds. Results of functional assays for NSC305787 and NSC668394 are presented
in the following sections.
NSC305787 and NSC668394 inhibit ezrin T567 phosphorylation and actin binding

$watermark-text
$watermark-text

Ezrin T567 phosphorylation is critical for its activation, enabling the interaction of ezrin
with other cellular proteins such as actin (Matsui et al., 1998). Dynamic regulation of ezrin
phosphorylation during metastatic progression is linked to PKC activation. Members of this
serine/threonine kinase family that phosphorylate ezrin at T567 in OS cells include PKCα, Ι
and γ (Ren et al., 2009). We examined effects of NSC305787 and NSC668394 on in vitro
ezrin phosphorylation by PKCΙ. PKCΙ phosphorylation of recombinant ezrin was inhibited
by NSC305787 with an IC50 of 8.3 μM (Figure 2a) and by NSC668394 with an IC50 of 8.1
μM (Figure 2b). To determine whether reduced ezrin phosphorylation resulted from kinase
inhibition, we tested the effect of the lead compounds on three PKC isoforms (PKCΙ, α and
γ) using a non-specific substrate (myelin basic protein). To inhibit all three PKC isoforms,
NSC305787 required higher concentration than that required to inhibit ezrin
phosphorylation (Figure 2a). NSC668394 did not show any significant inhibition of PKC
activity at the doses tested in the present study (maximum, 100 μM) (Figure 2b).
Additionally, direct interaction experiments with Biacore revealed significantly weaker
binding affinity for PKCΙ compared with ezrin: NSC305787 and NSC668394 bound to
PKCΙ with KD values of 172.4 μM and 58.1 μM, respectively (data not shown). These
results strongly suggest that NSC305787 and NSC668394 inhibit ezrin T567
phosphorylation primarily via their binding to ezrin and not through inhibition of PKCΙ
kinase activity. We also analyzed the effect of both compounds on PKCΙ phosphorylation of
other ERM family members, radixin and moesin by using similar in vitro kinase assays
(Supplementary Figure 4). The IC50 value for NSC305787 on PKCΙ phosphorylation of
moesin was 9.4 μM, whereas IC50 value for NSC305787 on PKCΙ phosphorylation of
radixin was 55 μM. IC50 values for NSC668394 on PKCΙ phosphorylation of moesin and
radixin were 59.5 and 35.3 μM, respectively. These data on in vitro kinase assays of ezrin,
myelin basic protein (non-ezrin substrate) and other ERM family members are summarized
in Supplementary Table 1.
In addition, we tested the effect of NSC305787 and NSC668394 on phosphorylation and
actin binding of endogenous ezrin in highly metastatic K7M2 OS cells. Both NSC305787
and NSC668394 inhibited T567 phosphorylation and actin binding of endogenous ezrin at
10 μM without altering cellular ezrin levels (Figure 2c).
OS cell invasion is inhibited by NSC305787 and NSC668394
Higher levels of ezrin expression in K7M2 cells compared with K12 cells led to enhanced
metastatic potential of K7M2 cells (Figure 3a) (Khanna et al., 2001). We tested all 65 initial
hits for inhibition of cell motility of both cell lines in a modified Boyden chamber (Neuro
Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) chemotaxis assay. Any molecule that inhibited
chemotaxis without cellular toxicity was given higher priority. The anti-invasive potential of

NSC305787 and NSC668394 was further validated using an electric cell impedance sensing
system involving real-time measurement of changes in cell resistance as a human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) monolayer was disrupted by invading tumor cells. Both
NSC305787 and NSC668394 inhibited invasion by K7M2 cells on the HUVEC monolayer
(Figures 3b and c). This inhibition at 10 μM was statistically different from that of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (1%) control at 5 h (P = 0.0137 and P = 0.0020, respectively; t-test).
NSC305787 and NSC668394 demonstrated no effect on invasion by K12 cells. Neither
compound was cytotoxic to K7M2 cells, K12 cells or HUVECs at this concentration in cell
viability assays (data not shown). Furthermore, we performed a cellular migration assay in
K7M2 cells to analyze any potential synergy between both compounds using the electric cell
impedance sensing system. The IC50 values obtained from this assay were very much
similar suggesting that the compounds do not show any synergy (Supplementary Figure 5).

development

In zebrafish studies with ezrin, direct changes in interaction patterns have not been reported.
In mesendodermal cells, ezrin2 (the zebrafish homolog) was shown to be activated by
phosphorylation on the C-terminal threonine residue and was required for proper germ layer
morphogenesis during gastrulation (Link et al., 2006). Inhibition of ezrin2 expression by
morpholino anti-sense oligonucleotides (MO) results in an unique phenotype in zebrafish
embryos (Link et al., 2006). Therefore, we tested the effect of the 65 primary hit compounds
on early zebrafish embryonicdevelopment. Small molecules that killed embryos before 70%
epiboly during gastrulation were eliminated based on toxicity. The ezrin MO phenotype,
characterized by reduced epiboly movements resulting from defective germ layer
morphogenesis, was confirmed by microinjection of MO as described by Link et al. (Figures
4a and e). Treatment with 10-μM NSC305787 mimicked the ezrin MO phenotype (Figures
4b and e). Embryos treated with 10-μM NSC668394 showed normal development at earlier
stages, but had a very distinctive cycloptic eye phenotype by 28 h after fertilization (hpf)
(Figures 4c and e). When NSC668394 was removed before 48 hpf, the animals survived up
to 7 days and were able to swim, and their cycloptic eyes were otherwise functional as the
single eye moved and responded to light (Figures 4d and e). In normal zebrafish
development, the eye field extends across the midline, and as progenitor cells divide, they
move laterally to form two separate eyes. Therefore, the observed cycloptic phenotype
suggests stalling of eye precursor cells in the midline.

$watermark-text

We also tested the effect of NSC305787 and NSC668394 on Xenopus embryonic
development. Following treatment with 10-μM NSC305787, the embryos exhibited
gastrulation defects at stage 12.5, while NSC668394-treated embryos showed very mild
effects. By stage 37, both compounds (10 μM) caused delays in development and ventral
defects. By stage 50, embryos had short and bent tails and reduced eyes, suggesting
inhibition of cell motility (Supplementary Figure 6). Treatment with high concentrations (40
μM) of compounds caused severe gastrulation defects and embryonic death. Because no
validated ezrin MO exists in Xenopus, we could not confirm that the observed phenotype in
Xenopus was ezrin-specific.
Prevention of metastatic growth in a lung organ culture assay
In OS, the predominant site of recurrence is the lung, and the main cause of OS patient death
is pulmonary metastasis (Dunn and Dehner, 1977). Metastasis is a multi-step process,
involving invasion, extravasation and survival at the distant site. To evaluate the inhibitory
potential of the lead compounds on pulmonary metastatic growth, we performed an ex vivo
mouse lung organ culture assay. This method measures the effect on survival at the
metastatic site. In this method, tumor cells reaching the lung following tail vein injection

grow in the lung slices maintained in organ culture, resembling in vivo lung metastasis
(Mendoza et al., 2010). When green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing K7M2 cells were
injected through tail veins, metastatic foci were scored in lung organ cultures, which then
were quantitated by GFP intensity using fluorescence microscopy. Both NSC305787 (P =
0.003) and NSC668394 (P = 0.0054) significantly inhibited the lung metastases growth of
high-ezrin-expressing K7M2 OS cells in this organ culture assay (Figures 5a and b).

After observing inhibition of lung metastatic growth in lung organ culture, we tested the
effect of NSC305787 and NSC668394 in an in vivo lung metastasis model. Mice were
injected with either GFP-expressing K7M2 or MNNG-HOS cells, and then treated with
NSC305787 or NSC668394. Following injection of K7M2 cells through tail veins, vehicletreated animals died because of progressive lung metastases within approximately 4 weeks
(median survival = 28.5 days). NSC305787- and NSC668394-treated animals survived up to
50 and 49 days, respectively (Figure 6a). The overall survival of NSC305787-treated mice
was significantly different from that of the vehicle-treated group (P = 0.0337). NSC668394treated mice showed an increase in survival but this increase was not statistically significant
from the vehicle group (P = 0.0524). When lung tissues were harvested and analyzed, we
observed a significant decrease in the number of the GFP-expressing metastatic foci in the
lung tissues of NSC305787- and NSC668394-treated groups (Figure 6b).

$watermark-text

MNNG-HOS is an OS cell line with an ezrin-independent metastatic phenotype in contrast
to K7M2 cells (Wan et al., 2009). Thus, we used MNNG-HOS cells as a negative control for
ezrin-dependent specificity. Animals injected with GFP-expressing MNNG-HOS cells by
tail vein and treated with NSC305787 or NSC668394 demonstrated no difference in survival
between control and treatment groups. The median survivals of vehicle-, NSC305787- and
NSC668394-treated MNNG-HOS cells were 50.5, 49 and 48.5 days, respectively (Figure
6c). We observed no differences among the vehicle-, NSC305787- and NSC668394-treated
groups regarding the number of GFP-expressing metastatic foci in lung tissues (Figure 6d).

Discussion

$watermark-text

Ezrin is a key regulator in the progression and metastasis of pediatric tumors, including OS
and rhabdomyosarcoma (Khanna et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004). To develop ezrin-targeted
therapy, we used SPR technology to screen 3081 small molecules that bind to ezrin and
identified 65 initial hits. These small molecules were then evaluated biologically and
biochemically for their potential to inhibit ezrin activity. NSC305787 and NSC668394 were
selected based on their ability to inhibit ezrin function in multiple functional assays and their
higher ezrin-binding affinity (~ 10 μM).
Our experiments were designed to discover small molecules that specifically inhibited ezrin
function and were related to metastasis. Because ezrin loss does not affect cell viability in
most cancer cells, we selectively discarded small molecules that were cytotoxic in either cell
culture or zebrafish embryo assays. Therefore, we are the first to demonstrate that
NSC305787 and NSC668394 directly target the anti-metastatic properties of ezrin. Our lead
compounds inhibited ezrin T567 phosphorylation in the low micromolar range both in vivo
and in vitro. During in vivo experiments, we did not observe a clear inhibition on the
phosphoezrin levels in whole cell lysates, whereas in lysates immunoprecipitated with ezrin
antibody, this inhibition on the phospho-ezrin protein levels was significant. This may be
related to the specificity of the phosphoantibody, which recognized all three members of the
ERM family. In in vitro experiments though, we were able to show stronger inhibition in
phosphorylation levels of the T567 threonine residue on recombinant ezrin protein when

compared with the relevant threonine residues on other ERM members, radixin and moesin.
Besides, we checked ezrin phosphorylation levels in our in vivo experiments. Phospho-ezrin
levels were compared in lung–liver–kidney–spleen–skin samples between control (DMSO)
vs NSC305787- and NSC668394- treated animals, but did not observe any meaningful
differences. We believe that inhibition of ezrin phosphorylation is one of the mechanisms
that NSC305787 and NSC668394 inhibit ezrin function. These lead compounds are likely to
act through different mechanisms involving ezrin some of which may not require
phosphorylated ezrin. Therefore, NSC305787 and NSC668394 inhibition of ezrin is still
possible without inhibiting ezrin phosphorylation.

$watermark-text

Targeted, direct small molecule binding to ezrin that reduces phosphorylation is a novel
mechanism for the prevention of metastatic disease. We confirmed that both NSC305787
and NSC668394 inhibited the motility of metastatic murine OS cells with high ezrin
expression. In a second confirmatory model, these compounds also inhibited mouse
pulmonary metastases only in OS cells that require ezrin. This in vivo model not only
supports that NSC305787 and NSC668394 eliminate ezrinmodulated metastases, but also
the specificity of these compounds.

$watermark-text
$watermark-text

Although NSC305787 and NSC668394 possess potent anti-metastatic activities against OS
cells through inhibition of ezrin function both in vitro and in vivo, the underlying molecular
mechanisms remain poorly understood. Because ezrin lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity, it
exhibits its biological functions through regulation of the cell cytoskeleton and activities of
signaling pathways through protein–protein interactions. NSC305787 and NSC668394 may
likely target protein interactions involving ezrin. T567 phosphorylation leads to a
conformational change in the tertiary structure of ezrin by reducing the affinity of the Cterminal domain for the N-terminal 4.1/ERM (FERM) domain. This creates an open
conformation allowing proteins such as F-actin to bind to ezrin (Gary and Bretscher, 1995).
Two potential mechanisms of NSC305787- and NSC668394-mediated ezrin inhibition are
reduced T567 phosphorylation and blocking protein–protein interactions directly involving
ezrin. These two are not necessarily related to each other. It is possible to block protein–
protein interactions of ezrin without affecting its phosphorylation levels. These in vitro
experiments were performed by using WT and T567D forms of recombinant ezrin proteins
that are synthesized in M15 bacteria, a derivative of E.coli. We have done several
experiments to confirm that these proteins are properly folded based on better actin binding.
However, these experiments can not establish what percentage of the total protein is in open
form vs closed form. Furthermore, a computational structure analysis based on existing ezrin
domain structures suggests several potential binding sites for NSC305787 and NSC668394
that are not on T567D. Binding of these small molecules may occur at multiple sites on ezrin
leading to local conformational changes without directly interfering T567 phosphorylation
site, but effecting interaction of other proteins with ezrin.
NSC305787 and NSC668394 both inhibited ezrin phosphorylation and showed mostly
comparable effects on inhibiting ezrin functions in vitro and in vivo. However, clear
divergence was found in different assays: NSC305787 treatment of zebrafish embryos
mimicked the ezrin MO phenotype, whereas treatment with NSC668394 showed normal
development at earlier stages, but demonstrated a distinctive cycloptic eye phenotype later in
development (Figure 4). NSC305787 was more effective in preventing lung metastasis than
NSC668394 (Figure 5). The compounds also revealed different binding kinetics:
NSC305787 bound to and dissociated faster from ezrin than NSC668394. These results
suggest that, although NSC305787 and NSC668394 both exhibit inhibitory effects on ezrin
function, they likely exert these effects through different mechanisms such as altering
different protein–protein interactions involving ezrin. Based on these results, we also tested
any possible synergistic effect of NSC305787 and NSC668394 on K7M2 cellular migration,

but did not observe any combined inhibitory effect. It is important to note that high
homology exists among ERM family proteins (Fehon et al., 2010). Therefore, the observed
results in this study could be partially due to inhibition of radixin and moesin as much as
inhibition of ezrin. However, both NSC305787 and NSC668394 were very well tolerated in
vivo without any obvious acute toxicity. When we performed maximum tolerable dose
studies before our mouse experiments, all five animals in each group survived the 5-day
intraperitoneal treatment of NSC305787 and NSC668394 at 2.4 and 2.26 mg/kg/day,
respectively.

$watermark-text

In conclusion, we targeted protein–protein interactions involving ezrin as a novel antimetastatic therapy. Although future studies are required to evaluate the specificity of
NSC305787 and NSC668394, their molecular frameworks possess a functionalized
quinoline pharmacophore, which is a common motif in clinical therapeutics (Ohnmacht et
al., 1971; Boger et al., 1987). Analysis of the molecular weight, hydrogen bonding moieties
and predicted partition coefficient with Lipinski’s rule-of-five analysis (Lipinski et al., 2001)
validated the drug-like composition of these compounds. Therefore, NSC305787 and
NSC668394 can likely be developed as novel anti-ezrin compounds for clinical applications.

Materials and methods
Ezrin purification
Recombinant WT and T567D ezrin proteins were purified as described previously (Reczek
et al., 1997).

$watermark-text

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed with ezrin (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA), phosphoezrin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), and actin (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) antibodies as previously described (Ren et al.,
2009).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

$watermark-text

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments were performed by coating a 96-well
plate with recombinant actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO, USA) or bovine serum
albumin. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 200 μl of blocking reagent (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed five times with
phosphate-buffered saline-T (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20).
Recombinant WT or T567D ezrin proteins were added and incubated for 2 h at room
temperature. Following washes with phosphate-buffered saline-T, WT or T567D ezrin
bound to actin protein was detected by an ezrin antibody and an horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). After a final washing step, 2,2′-azinodi-3-ethylbenzthiazline sulfonate (ABTS, Sigma-Aldrich) substrate was added and the
optical density at 405 nm was read after 10 min.
SPR
Compounds were acquired from four libraries (Challenge Set, Diversity Set, Mechanistic Set
and Natural Product Set) of the Developmental Therapeutics Program within National
Cancer Institute. Their direct ezrin-binding potential was analyzed using the Biacore T100
instrument (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Recombinant WT ezrin protein was
immobilized onto a Biacore CM5 sensorchip, and compounds were injected individually as
the binding interactions were recorded. Any molecule giving more than 10 resonance units
of binding signal with an acceptable curve shape was deemed an initial hit. Results were
analyzed using the Biacore T-100 v2.0.3 analysis software (GE Healthcare).

Molecular modeling and docking studies
The X-ray crystal structure of Ezrin (PDB: 1NI2) was used for the molecular docking of
NSC305787 and NSC668394. Ezrin structure was minimized with AMBER 9.0 (University
of California, San Fransisco, CA, USA) (Case et al., 2004) with SANDER default
parameters. Docking experiments were performed using SurflexDock module of Sybyl 8.1
(Tripos International, St Louis, MO, USA) with a number of solution conformations were
set to 90. The best docked geometry for compounds was energy minimized with SANDER
module of AMBER9.0 (Case et al., 2004).
Molecular dynamics simulations

$watermark-text

To relax the docked complex, compounds docked models were subjected to molecular
dynamics simulations using AMBER 9.0 (Case et al., 2004) with the general amber force
field (Wang et al., 2004) and RMSD charge models (Bayly et al., 1993). Molecular
dynamics simulations performed in the micro canonical ensemble (NVE; moles (N), volume
(V), energy (E) are conserved) consisted of an initial equilibration of 10 ps followed by a
production run of 100 ps dynamics at 300 K. The final complex structure at the end of the
molecular dynamics simulation was subjected to 2000 steps of steepest descent energy
minimization followed by conjugate gradient energy minimization. A distance-dependent
dielectric constant and non-bonded distance cutoff of 15Å were used.
In vitro kinase assay

$watermark-text

Recombinant ezrin protein (500 ng) was incubated with the compounds at 1–100-μM
concentrations for 15 min on ice, and then 50-ng PKCΙ (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was
added. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding 2 × sample
buffer. NSC305787 and NSC668394 profiling of PKCΙ, α and γ were performed on a nonspecific substrate (myelin basic protein) using the Kinase Inhibitor Compound Profiling
service (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation, Vancouver, BC, Canada).
Chemotaxis assay
Chemotaxis experiments were performed in 96-well Boyden chambers as described
previously (Chen et al., 2008). All 96-well chemotaxis assays were conducted in parallel
with a 96-well viability assays to rule out toxicity. The WST viability assay was performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA).

$watermark-text

Invasion assay
The anti-invasive potential of NSC305787 and NSC668394 was validated using the
xCELLigence electric cell impedance system (Roche). Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs; 2.5 × 104/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate in endothelial growth
media-2 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Following formation of a confluent HUVEC
monolayer (~32 h), endothelial growth media-2 was aspirated and a layer of OS cells (1.0 ×
104 cells/well) was added to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium containing the compounds.
This specific time point was accepted as 0 h of treatment, and invasion was monitored
during the subsequent 5 h by measuring changes in resistance at the cell-electrode
interphase. The cell index was calculated according to the following formula: cell index =
(Rt – R0)/F, where Rt is resistance at time point t, R0 is background resistance (measured
with media alone, no cells) and F is frequency at which the measurement was taken (10
kHz).
Cell migration assay
Cell migration experiments were performed using the CIM-plate 16 migration chamber from
xCELLigence electric cell impedance system (Roche). A total volume of 150 μl containing
Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 December 04.

Bulut et al.

Page 10

K7M2 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) and compounds at various concentrations were applied to
the upper chamber in a serumfree media containing 1% DMSO. The lower chamber was
loaded with 160 μl of a 10% fetal bovine serum media containing 1% DMSO as the
chemoattractant. Cell migration was monitored in ‘real-time’ for a period of 24 h.
Zebrafish embryo development assay

$watermark-text

Zebrafish were maintained as described previously (Westerfield, 1993). Embryo
development was followed by morphological characterization (Kimmel et al., 1995). For
experiments involving MO injections, a translation-blocking anti-ezrin MO was synthesized
by Gene-Tools, LCC (Philomath, OR, USA). This MO has been previously described and
validated by Link et al. 2006. For chemical screening, zebrafish embryos were arrayed in
96-well plates. Compounds were added at 1–33-μM concentrations. Embryos were observed
at 70% epiboly, 24–28 hpf and 48 hpf. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Georgetown University.
Xenopus embryo development assay

Xenopus embryos were in vitro fertilized and cultured in 0.1X MBS (8.8 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
KCl, 0.1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM HEPES and 0.25 mM NaHCO3, (pH 7.8)) and treated with
NSC305787 and NSC668394 blindly at the two-cell stage in 96-well plates.
Pulmonary metastasis assay

$watermark-text

The technique of isolated lung organ culture was performed as reported by Mendoza et al
(Mendoza et al., 2010). Fresh media or compounds (10 μM) were replaced every other day.
A LEICA-DM IRB fluorescence inverted microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL) and Retiga-EXi
Fast 1394 Mono Cooled CCD camera (Qimaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) were used to capture
images of GFP-positive tumor cells within the pulmonary metastasis assay at × 100
magnification. Metastatic burden was quantified by measuring the fluorescent area of
metastatic cells in each lung section at each time point and was expressed as mean
fluorescent area (mean fluorescent area of each lung section over four lung sections). The
mean fluorescent area was normalized to 100 pixels for day 0 to allow quantitative
evaluation of metastatic progression over time.
In vivo experimental metastasis model

$watermark-text

GFP-expressing K7M2 or MNNG-HOS tumor cells (1 × 106) were delivered by tail vein to
female BALB/c (K7M2; Taconic, Hudson, NY, USA) or SCID/Beige (Charles Rivers,
Wilmington, MA, USA) mice. One day after tumor cell injection, vehicle (n = 10)
(dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 1%), NSC305787 (n = 10) (0.240 mg/kg/day) or NSC668394
(n = 10) (0.226 mg/kg/day) was administered 5-days a week by intraperitoneal injection.
Mice were then monitored for evidence of morbidity including anorexia, dehydration,
dyspnea and decreased activity and grooming behavior. Euthanasia of mice with presumed
pulmonary metastases was based on the development of these symptoms. Animals were
euthanized at day 66 regardless of these symptoms. All mice had necropsy to confirm
metastatic lung disease. Animal studies were approved by an Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA). Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.

NSC305787 and NSC668394 cause reduced cell motility phenotypes in zebrafish. (a) In the
late blastula period, blastodisc cells begin to spread over the yolk cell in the process of
epiboly. Reduction of ezrin protein levels by anti-sense MO results in epiboly defects
characterized by cells not spreading over the yolk cell but instead piling up at the animal
pole. MO-injected embryos were scored for epiboly defects at the 90% epiboly stage: WT
(un-injected), 4/73 (5%); 3 ng MO, 5/12 (42%); 6 ng MO, 33/48 (69%); and 12 ng MO,
20/29 (69%). (b) When embryos were treated with 10-μM NSC305787, 12 of 81 embryos
(15%) exhibited epiboly defects that completely mimicked MO-injected embryos. At 20-μM
NSC305787, 71 of 71 embryos (100%) demonstrated epiboly defects. (c) Normal eye
development follows lateral movement of progenitor cells to form two eyes in WT embryos.
NSC668394 (10 μM) inhibited motility of eye progenitor cells, resulting in cycloptic
embryos at 28 hpf in 97 of 99 embryos (98%). (d) NSC668394-treated embryos continued to
grow and formed a single functional eye at 6 days after fertilization. (e) Percentages of
animals with the observed phenotypes upon treatment are indicated.

from the vehicle group (P-value of NSC305787 is 0.0337 and NSC668394 is 0.0524). Logrank statistics were used for survival curves. (b) Representative fluorescence images of
whole lungs at the time of necropsy are shown. (c) Survival ratios of the groups were not
different because MNNG-HOS is an ezrin-independent cell line. (d) Representative
fluorescence images of whole lungs from MNNG-HOS-injected animals at the time of
necropsy are shown.
