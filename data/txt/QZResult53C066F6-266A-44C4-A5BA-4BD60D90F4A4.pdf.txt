ABSTRACT
Tasquinimod, an orally active quinoline-3-carboxamide, binds with high affinity
to HDAC4 and S100A9 in cancer and infiltrating host cells within compromised tumor
microenvironment inhibiting adaptive survival pathways needed for an angiogenic
response. Clinical trials document that as low as 0.5-1mg tasquinimod/day is
therapeutic against castrate resistant metastatic prostate cancer. Tasquinimod is
metabolized via cytochrome P4503A4, but ketoconazole at a dose which completely
inhibits CYP3A metabolism does not affect tasquinimod’s ability to inhibit endothelial
“sprouting” in vitro or anti-cancer efficacy against human prostate cancer xenografts
in vivo.
Tasquinimod’s potency is facilitated by its reversible binding (Kd < 35 μM) to the
IIA subdomain of albumin (Sudlow’s site I). As blood vessels within the compromised
cancer microenvironment are characterized by a higher degree of leakiness than
those in normal tissues, this results in an enhanced uptake of tasquinimod bound
to albumin in cancer tissue via a tumor specific process known as the “enhanced
permeability and retention” (i.e., EPR) effect. Thus, despite plasma levels of < 1 µM,
the EPR effect results in intracellular drug concentrations of 2-3 µM, levels severalfold higher than needed for inhibition of endothelial sprouting (IC50 ~ 0.5 µM) or for
inhibition of HDAC4 and S100A9 mediated tumor growth.

INTRODUCTION

CID 546828876; CAS number 254964-60-8), Figure
1A, is an orally active quinoline-3-carboxamide which
produces robust and consistent in vivo growth inhibition
as well as suppression of metastasis in a large series of
pre-clinical human xenograft and rodent prostate cancer
models [7-12]. Tasquinimod’s anti-cancer efficacy
involves its inhibition of the reciprocal survival signaling
pathways between the cancer cells and tumor infiltrating
host cells suppressing the angiogenic switch needed for
continued malignant growth in the compromised tumor
microenvironment [9- 12]. Tasquinimod is currently in
clinical development for the treatment of prostate cancer
and other solid malignancies [13, 14]. In a placebo-

Cancers outgrow their blood supply resulting in
the tumor microenvironment becoming acidic, hypoxic,
and low in nutrients [1]. To continue growth in such a
compromised (i.e., stressful) tumor microenvironment,
cancer cells must initiate adaptive survival pathways
and activate an angiogenic switch [2]. Activation of this
switch recruits infiltrating host cells such as endothelial
cells, myeloid- derived suppressor cells (MDSC),
macrophages, and bone marrow derived mesenchymal
stem cells needed for the chronic stimulation of tumor
angiogenesis [2-6]. Tasquinimod (ABR-215050; PubChem

controlled, phase II randomized trial, tasquinimod
doubled median progression-free survival and prolonged
survival of patients with metastatic, castrate resistant
prostate cancer [15, 16]. A registration phase III clinical
trial of tasquinimod as monotherapy in the same patient
population is ongoing (NCT01234311).
Mechanistic studies document that tasquinimod’s
therapeutic response is initiated by high affinity binding
to at least two proteins, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4)
[12] and S100A9 [17, 18]. Binding to HDAC4 is relevant
since prostate cancer cells over express this protein and are
inhibited in their adaptive survival response to a stressful
microenvironment when transcription of this gene is
knocked down resulting in their loss of tumorigenic
ability [12]. In addition, when HDAC4 is knocked down
in endothelial cells, their angiogenic ability is suppressed
[12]. Tasquinimod treatment phenocopies HDAC4 knock
down with regard to inhibition of prostate cancer cell
survival signaling and endothelial angiogenesis under
stressful hypoxic conditions [12]. Additional studies
document that when tasquinimod binds to the open
conformation of HDAC4, it prevents binding of N-CoR/
HDAC3 thus preventing client protein deacetylation in
both hypoxic cancer cells and their endothelial support
cells needed for survival signaling and angiogenesis [12].
In addition to HDAC4, tasquinimod also binds
S100A9 [17, 18], a 14 kDa Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding protein
which forms homo- and hetero- (with S100A8) dimers
[24]. When secreted, S100A9 undergoes a conformational
change becoming an agonist for the pro-inflammatory
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the receptor for advanced
glycation end products (RAGE) inducing proinflammatory
danger signals [17]. Tasquinimod binds to S100A9 in a
Zn2+ dependent manner and thus inhibits TLR4 and RAGE
induced signaling [17, 18]. This is significant because
S100A9 binding to TLR4 stimulates tumor infiltration
of MDSCs [3, 17, 25]. MDSCs in turn express and
secrete S100A9 and can , under hypoxia, differentiate via
HIF-1α dependent transcription into tumor- associated
macrophages which secrete angiogenic factors such as
VEGF, FGF, TNF-α, and TGF-β [4, 5]. This is consistent
with the observation that exogenous S100A9 can
stimulate matrigel plug angiogenesis in vivo [26]. Also, an
increase in HIF-1α protein induced by hypoxia enhances
transcription, expression, and secretion of S100A9 protein
in the tumor microenvironment also by prostate cancer
cells [27].
Tasquinimod’s physiochemical properties and high
gastrointestinal permeability contribute to its excellent
bioavailability and oral absorption when given at a daily
dose either as a liquid or as a gelatin capsule [13]. Once
in the blood, quinoline-3-carboxamide compounds like
tasquinimod are metabolized primarily by the liver to
both more, as well as, less water soluble metabolites [28,
29]. Despite its small size and its metabolism, chronic
daily oral dosing with only 1 mg of tasquinimod (i.e.,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

14.2 μg/kg or 35 nmoles/kg) in clinical trials maintains
a blood level of ~ 0.5μM with a plasma half-life of 40 ±
16 hours [13]. The present studies aimed at elucidating
the mechanism(s) behind these findings and to explore
whether the parent drug or metabolites accounts for the
high potency of tasquinimod.

RESULTS
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tasquinimod
The bioavailability and oral absorption of
tasquinimod is excellent when adult male mice (i.e.,
C57Bl/6J, or athymic nude mice) are given 0.1-30 mg/
kg (i.e., 0.2-74 µmoles/kg) via gavage or the drinking
water [7]. The potency of tasquinimod expressed as the
daily oral dose of tasquinimod which inhibits cancer
growth by 50% ranges from 0.1-1.0 mg/kg/d (i.e., 0.242.40 µmoles/kg/day) against a series (n>5) of human
prostate cancer xenografts in immune-deficient mice [712]. Tasquinimod’s oral potency is not restricted to human
prostate cancer xenografts growing in immune-suppressed
mice. For example, tasquinimod at a chronic dose of 5 mg/
kg/day via the drinking water produces > 80% inhibition
(p<0.05) of TRAMP-C2 mouse prostate cancer growth in
immune-competent syngeneic mice, Figure 1B. Associated
with this growth inhibition is a 75 ± 9% inhibition
(p<0.05) of blood vessel density within the TRAMP-C2
cancers in the tasquinimod treated vs. control animals.
To determine whether this chronic 5 mg/kg/day oral
dosing regimen produces similar blood concentrations
in mice as obtained in human trials, intact adult male
C57Bl/6J mice (n=4) were given 14C- radiolabeled
tasquinimod via oral gavage and then the plasma
concentration of drug at the end of 5 days determined
based upon radioactivity levels. These results validated
that dosing with 5 mg/kg/day produces a nadir plasma
concentration of 1.08 ± 0.21 μM in mice which is the same
concentration range as in the human clinical trials. Based
upon these results, oral dosing of 5 mg/kg/day was used
for all the subsequent PK studies.
To determine the PK of tasquinimod, nude mice
with growing (i.e., 200-400 mm3) CWR-22Rv1 human
prostate cancer xenografts were given 14C-radiolabeled
drug at a dose of 5 mg/kg via oral gavage and the
plasma and tissue (i.e., liver, kidney, and tumor) drug
concentration determined. Maximum tasquinimod plasma
concentration is reached within 1 hour after oral gavage of
mice, Figure 1C. After this absorption phase, the plasma
concentration declines bi-exponentially as the sum of two
first-order processes involving tissue distribution, with the
plasma concentration remaining above 1 μM for at least
24 hours, Figure 1D. These PK results support a twocompartment model composed of a central and peripheral

compartment. In the absorption phase, the apparent
volume of distribution is low (i.e., 0.31 L/kg) but is still
more than 3 times the total volume of the blood (i.e., 0.1
L/kg [30]) and is equal to the extracellular body fluid (i.e.
0.2 L/kg [31]) plus the total volume of blood in a mouse
(i.e., 0.30 L/kg).

After the rapid α-distribution phase following
oral dosing of 5 mg/kg of tasquinimod, there is a much
slower β-elimination phase (i.e., half-life > 10 hour),
Figures 1C&D. During this β-elimination phase,
tasquinimod in the extracellular fluid can enter cells
where it can be metabolized. The liver is the major site

of metabolism for quinoline-3-carboxamide compounds
via Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP-3A) which can be
inhibited by ketoconazole [29]. This conclusion is
confirmed by the demonstration that co-treatment of
mice with ketoconazole, at an oral dose of 25mg/kg/
day which inhibits CYP-3A by > 90% [32], decreases
tasquinimod’s β-elimination phase resulting in an
increase in the plasma elimination half-life by more
than 8 fold, Figure1D. Metabolically, tasquinimod can
be: 1) hydroxylated in the aromatic quinoline scaffold
in multiple sites, 2) N-demethylated at the quinoline
nitrogen, 3) N-demethylated at the carboxamide nitrogen,
or 4) O-demethylated at the quinoline methoxy group,
Figure1E.

To determine the concentration of metabolites,
nude mice bearing CWR-22Rv1 prostate cancers were
orally administered with 5 mg/kg of 14C- radiolabeled
tasquinimod and 4 and 24 hours later, blood plasma and
liver, kidney, and cancer tissue harvested and analyzed for
determination of metabolites. These studies demonstrated
that by 4 hours post administration more than 70% of
the drug within the liver is present as metabolites, in
line with the liver being the major site of metabolism
of tasquinimod. The predominant metabolite is the
O-demethylated quinoline compound, Figure 2A&B, but
the concentration of the hydroxylated aromatic quinoline
and the N-demethylated quinoline compounds, along
with the O-demethylated quinoline compound are also

higher in the liver than the blood at the time point studied,
Figure 2B. Also in the kidney 40% of the drug is present
as metabolites, with the concentration of the hydroxylated
aromatic quinoline and the O-demethylated quinoline
compounds being higher than in the blood, Figure 2B. In
contrast, within the cancer > 80% of the total concentration
of drug is present as parent tasquinimod, Figure 2B. Only
the O-demethylated quinoline compound is present at a
higher concentration in the cancer than blood, Figure 2B.
The plasma concentration of total metabolites is < 10% at
4 hours, Figure 2B, and 24 hours post oral dosing with 5
mg/kg, Figure 2A.

ibuprofen were tested for their dose-response ability to
compete with 14C-labeled tasquinimod binding to mouse
albumin. Only phenybutazone competed with tasquinimod
binding to albumin documenting that tasquinimod binds
to the IIA subdomain of albumin (i.e., at Sudlow’s site I),
Figure 2D.
In additional studies, 200 μg (i.e., 3nmol) of human
serum albumin (HSA) was incubated with 400 pmoles
of 14C-labeled tasquinimod at pH 7.4 so that 50% of the
drug is protein bound. This solution was then placed in a
dialysis chamber opposite an equal volume of a solution
containing 8 mg (i.e., 120 nmoles) of drug free HSA at
pH 7.4 separated by a membrane which is permeable to
unbound free tasquinimod, but impermeable to albumin.
The 8 mg of HSA in the initial drug free side was chosen
because this amount of albumin can bind 98% of the drug
when exposed to 400 pmoles of tasquinimod. Analysis
of the amount of drug in the two compartments after 4
hours of dialysis demonstrated that 65 ± 9 % of the initial
protein bound tasquinimod is released demonstrating that
tasquinimod binding to albumin is a reversible process.

Plasma Protein Binding of Tasquinimod
Analysis of fractionated whole blood at 4hours post
oral dosing indicates that tasquinimod is nearly exclusively
(> 98%) located in the plasma and not in blood cells. An
explanation for this highly restricted cellular uptake in the
blood is provided by the fact that protein binding fraction
(PBF) for tasquinimod in nude mouse plasma is 98 ± 1%.
This is not a nude mouse specific effect since incubation
of 1-50 μM radiolabeled tasquinimod with human plasma
or bovine fetal serum (FBS) results in a PBF of ~ 98%.
Using human plasma depleted of albumin identified
that the tasquinimod binding protein in the blood is
exclusively albumin. Such tasquinimod binding is albumin
concentration dependent, Figure 2C. Using equilibrium
dialysis, tasquinimod binds to human, mouse, and
bovine albumin at pH 7.4 with equilibrium dissociation
constant (i.e., Kd) of 24 ± 4 µM, 16 ± 3 µM and 31 ± 6
µM, respectively. These affinities and the fact that plasma
albumin concentration is > 450 µM in all of these species
explain why ~ 2% of the total plasma tasquinimod is nonprotein bound following oral dosing.

Consequence of Tasquinimod Albumin Binding
Following oral dosing with 5 mg/kg, the total
plasma Cmax is ~12 μM, Figure 1C, and thus the Cmax
for protein free-tasquinimod is only ~ 0.24 μM. It is
the free tasquinimod which then distributes rapidly into
the extracellular fluid of tissues with a half-life for this
α-distribution phase of only 3.2 hours, Figure 1D. When
CWR-22Rv1 tumor bearing mice (n=4) are orally dosed
with 5 mg/kg, the total drug concentration in normal
tissues (e.g. liver and kidney) and cancer reaches a
maximum within the first 5 hours post oral dosing, Figure
3A. When the tissue concentrations are normalized based
upon the percent vascular volume in normal (i.e., 10 ±
2% for liver and 13 ± 3% for kidney) vs. cancer tissue
(i.e., 2 ± 1% for CWR-22Rv1 prostate cancer), prostate
cancer tissue has a 3-5 fold higher (p<0.05) concentration
of tasquinimod than does either liver or kidney, Figure 3B.
These results are consistent with the fact that blood vessels
in sites of cancer are known to be much more permeable
to albumin than in normal tissues [35, 36]. Such a tumor
specific process is known as the enhanced permeability
and retention (i.e., EPR) effect [35, 36].
To evaluate the potential importance of an EPR
effect for enhancing tumor specific tasquinimod uptake
and thus anti-cancer potency, albumin retention in plasma
and normal tissue vs. prostate cancer was determined. To
do this, nude mice bearing CWR-22Rv1 prostate cancers
were injected intravenously (IV) with Evans Blue (EB) at
a dose (10mg/kg) so that all of the dye is initially bound
to albumin within the blood [35]. Twenty-four hours
later, the amount of albumin-EB complex retained in
plasma vs. accumulated in liver, kidney, or CWR-22Rv1
prostate cancers determined. The results are expressed as

Albumin Binding Site for Tasquinimod
Albumin has a modular structural organization
composed of 3 homologous domains (i.e., domain I, II, and
III) each consisting of two separate helical subdomains
termed A and B connected by a random coil [33]. Drug
binding is via one of three sites with the first located in
the IB subdomain, the second the IIA subdomain [i.e.,
Sudlow’s site I] and the third in the IIIA subdomain [i.e.,
Sudlow’s site II] [33]. The antiandrogen, bicalutamide, is
a typical IB ligand [34] while phenylbutazone is a typical
Sudlow’s site I ligand which usually contains bulky
heterocyclic molecules with a negative charge located in
the middle of the molecule) while ibuprofen is a typical
Sudlow’s site II ligand which often contains an aromatic
carboxylic acid with a negatively charged acidic group at
one end of the molecule away from a hydrophobic center
[33]. To determine whether tasquinimod binds to any of
these sites in albumin, bicalcutamide, phenybutazone, and

concentration of extractable albumin-EB in plasma vs.
the specified tissue. These studies document that prostate
cancers accumulate a concentration of albumin-EB that
is equal to that in the plasma by 24 hours, Figure 3C.
When normalized to vascular volume, the albumin-EB
accumulation by prostate cancers is more than two fold
greater (p<0.05) compared to liver and more than 8 fold
greater (p<0.05) compared to kidney, Figure 3C. As a
follow up to these results, the experiment was repeated
using CWR-22Rv1 prostate cancer bearing nude mice
which were treated with tasquinimod (i.e., 10 mg/kg/ day)
for a month. Such continuous treatment with tasquinimod

decreased the vascular volume within the cancers by
nearly half (p<0.05), Figure 3C. This anti-angiogenic
response resulted in a greater than 80% inhibition (p<0.05)
in cancer growth. When normalized to this decreased
vascular volume, the accumulation of albumin-EB 24
hours post IV injection of the dye in cancers is increased
(p<0.05) by 60% compared to non-tasquinimod treated
hosts, with no change in normalized accumulation in
either the kidney or liver, Figure 3C.

Tasquinimod Plasma Membrane vs. Nuclear
Uptake

protein-free concentration of tasquinimod in such media
is only 0.2 µM. Preliminary studies documented that even
after 48 hours of exposure of HUVEC and each of the 3
prostate cancer cell lines to 1 µM at confluent cell density,
there was < 15% metabolism of the parental tasquinimod
drug with the major metabolite being the O-demethylated
quinoline compound.
Based upon these preliminary validation, cells were
incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented
media containing 1µM 14C-labeled tasquinimod for <10
minutes. When these cells are rapidly (< 20sec) separated
from the media by vacuum filtration onto glass microfiber
filter and the filters rapidly (< 20sec) washed, radiolabeled
drug is retained by the washed cells and this radioactivity
can be used to calculate the total cell associated
concentration of drug (CAt). If instead after the washes,
media are added above the filters and allowed to remain

Since tasquinimod binds to both S100A9 and
HDAC4 proteins with high affinities and since S100A9
has both an extracellular and intracellular location [24]
while HDAC4 in prostate cancer cells is in the cell nucleus
[12], it is important to evaluate whether tasquinimod is
capable of entering cells or whether it only associates with
extracellular plasma membrane components. To resolve
this question, an in vitro approach was taken using three
human prostate cancer cells (i.e., CWR-22Rv1, LAPC4, and LNCaP) and human umbilical vein endothelial
(HUVEC) cells. When 1 µM tasquinimod is added to
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented media, there
is sufficient albumin to bind 80% of the drug so that the

for a 15 minutes “wash out” period before being vacuumed
off and subsequently rapidly (< 20sec) washed with drug
free media, no radioactivity is retained by the washed
cells. These results validate that the 15 minute washout
period allows elimination (i.e., dissociation) of low affinity
drug association with plasma membrane components
while retaining the total intracellular concentration of
drug (ICt). Thus, total plasma membrane associated drug
concentration (PMt) is determined by subtracting the ICt
from the CAt value.
Using this washout protocol, aliquots of CWR22Rv1, LAPC-4, or LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, as
well as human umbilical endothelial cells (i.e., HUVECs)
were incubated from 5 minutes to 48 hours with 1 µM
14
C-labeled tasquinimod in 10% FBS media containing 0.2
µM free non-albumin bound drug and the PMt determined.
Since essentially identical kinetic results were obtained
for all 3 prostate cancer lines as well as for HUVEC
cells, only representative results for the CWR-22Rv1
cells are presented in Figure 3B, left panel. These results
document that the total plasma membrane associated drug
concentration (PMt) rapidly reaches a steady state value
of ~ 1 µM within 5-10 minutes which exceeds that of the
protein-free drug concentration (i.e., 0.2 µM) in the media,
but is equal to total drug concentration in the media. This
~1 µM PMt is subsequently maintained during the 48
hours observation period.
To determine the total nuclear concentration of
drug (Nt), a modified protocol was needed to allow the
rapid lyses of cells and rapid isolation of cell nuclei by
differential centrifugation. This could not be accomplished
using the usual method of detergent lyses because
detergents extract bound drug due to its lipophilicity.
Therefore, a detergent free protocol using nitrogen
cavitation was developed to rapidly lyse cells and allow
the rapid isolation of nuclei via differential centrifugation.
Using this cavitation protocol, it was documented that
within 1 hour, total nuclear drug concentration (Nt) equals
that of the protein-free drug concentration in the media
(i.e., 0.2 µM), and that after 4 hours equals PMt (i.e., see
Figure 3B, right panel for representative results for the
CWR-22Rv1 cells). From 8 hours onward, Nt is more than
10 fold higher than the free and 2 fold higher than the
total drug concentration in the media, Figure 3B, right
panel. For example at 24 hours post exposure to 1 µM
tasquinimod in 10% FBS containing media, the Nt is
2.4 ± 0.3 µM, Figure 3B, right panel. At this 24 hours
period, total radioactive drug in isolated nuclei from all
3 prostate cancer lines, as well as HUVEC cells (i.e.,
nuclear concentration in these 4 lines ranged from 2.23.1 µM) was extracted with acetonitrile and the extracts
analyzed by HPLC. These results documented that > 95%
(i.e., more than a log higher than any of its metabolites)
of the drug present within nuclei from each of these 4 cell
lines is non-metabolized tasquinimod. These results raise
the issue of whether nuclear uptake of tasquinimod by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer and endothelial cells requires binding to albumin.
To resolve this, nuclear uptake was determined 24 hours
post exposure to 1 µM tasquinimod in serum free media.
These studies again documented that nuclear tasquinimod
concentration in these 4 cell lines ranged from 2.5-3.5 µM
documenting that binding to albumin is not required for
cell uptake.

Tasquinimod does not require metabolism for
activity
The nuclear uptake results are consistent with
tasquinimod being the active drug for both direct
therapeutic effects on cancer cells and indirect effects via
suppression of the angiogenic response of host endothelial
cells. To confirm these conclusions, the concentration of
tasquinimod metabolites produced by endothelial cells was
compared to the potency of these metabolites for inhibiting
angiogenesis. When HUVEC cells are exposed to 1 μM of
14
C-labeled tasquinimod for 48 hours, < 15% of the drug
is metabolized with 10% (i.e., 100 nM) being converted to
the quinoline-O-demethylated compound and < 2% (i.e., <
20 nM) being converted to the quinoline-N-demethylated
or carboxamide-N-demethylated compounds.
A three-dimensional (3D) in vitro endothelial
sprouting and tube formation assay was utilized to define
the anti-angiogenic potency of tasquinimod vs. these
metabolites. In this 3D assay, human umbilical endothelial
cells (i.e., HUVECs) are initially grown on microcarrier
beads and the cell coated beads embedded in fibrin gels
with media conditioned by normal human lung fibroblasts
[12]. Under these 3D-conditions, endothelial cells “sprout”
producing 3D neovessel tubes with patent lumen within
one week, Figure 4A - left panel. When tasquinimod is
added at the initiation to these 3D-cultures, sprouting of
the endothelial cells is inhibited, Figure 4B-right panel,
with the potency for such inhibition, expressed as an
IC50 value (i.e., the concentration of drug which inhibits
by 50% the endothelial sprouting) of 0.5 µM, Figure
4C. These results are significant since in clinical trials,
tasquinimod’s systemic anti-cancer potency coincidently
occurs at plasma levels of 0.5-1 µM [13, 15,]. Using this
3D-HUVEC assay, the potency (i.e., expressed as IC50) of
tasquinimod metabolites to inhibit endothelial sprouting
was compared to tasquinimod. These results document
that only the carboxamide-N-demethylated metabolite
is more potent (i.e., 2 fold lower IC50), with the other
metabolites being 40-60 fold less potent (i.e., higher IC50)
than tasquinimod, Figure 4C. Combining these sprouting
results with the HUVEC tasquinimod metabolic studies
documents that the concentration of carboxamide-Ndemethylated metabolite following exposure to 1 µM
tasquinimod (i.e., < 20 nM) is more than a log below
its IC50 and thus despite being 2-fold more potent than
tasquinimod, it is not the major active moiety. To further

confirm that tasquinimod itself and not the carboxamideN-demethylated metabolite is the active drug, the
response to ketoconazole alone and in combination with
tasquinimod was tested in the 3D-endothelial sprouting
assay. These studies demonstrate that ketoconazole
alone did not inhibit endothelial sprouting even at a
concentration of 10 μM which is > 50 times the IC50 of
0.2 μM for ketoconazole inhibition of CYP-3A [29]. In
addition when 10 μM ketoconazole is simultaneously
present, it does not prevent inhibition of 3D HUVEC
sprouting produced by 1 μM tasquinimod.
To confirm these in vitro results, mice were
inoculated subcutaneously (SQ) with CWR-22Rv1 cells

and remained untreated until the tumors grew to ~ 200
mm3 (i.e., ~ 200 mgs) and then they were randomly
assigned to groups (n=10) which were injected SQ daily
with 100 μl of propylene glycol vehicle only vs. vehicle
delivering 0.1 or 1 mg/kg/day of either tasquinimod or
its carboxamide-N-demethylated metabolite. Propylene
glycol was used as vehicle due to the low water solubility
of the carboxamide-N-demethylated metabolite. After
20 days of continuous treatment, the experiment was
terminated and the total weight of each cancer determined
and the results expressed both as average tumor weight in
grams and as the ratio of the weight of the cancers in the
treated vs. vehicle control animals (i.e., T/C ratio), Figure

vitro or anti-cancer efficacy against human prostate cancer
xenografts in vivo, Figure 5B. These combined in vitro/
in vivo results document that tasquinimod, not one of its
metabolites, is the active drug.
The present studies also identified that tasquinimod
reversibly binds to the IIA subdomain of albumin (i.e.,
Sudlow’s site I) with an equilibrium dissociation constant
of less than 30 µM, Figure 3C&D. This affinity together
with a plasma albumin concentration of > 450 µM [37],
explains why only ~ 2% of the total plasma tasquinimod
is non-protein bound following oral dosing. The fact that
98% of the plasma tasquinimod is albumin bound has
mechanistic consequences for its high potency as an anticancer drug. While the half-life of albumin is ~ 19 days
in humans, its plasma half-life is only about 1 day [37].
This is because despite tight endothelial barrier function,
albumin constantly leaves the plasma via endothelial
transcytosis and enters the extracellular fluid throughout
the body [38]. Due to this transcytosis, albumin makes
~ 15 around trips during its life-span to the extracellular
fluid returning via the lymphatic thoracic duct back to
the blood [37]. A distinct characteristic of cancer tissue
is a decrease in tumor endothelial barrier function which
enhances the leakage of plasma macromolecules like
albumin into the extracellular fluid which is coupled with a
lack of a functional lymphatic drainage [39]. Thus, unlike
the situation in normal tissues where albumin returns
from the extracellular fluid to the plasma via lymphatic
drainage, once in cancer extracellular fluid, albumin is
trapped and does not re-enter circulation [38].
A drug that interacts sufficiently strong with
albumin may be concentrated within the cancer tissue
through the tumor specific process known as the enhanced
permeability and retention (i.e., EPR) effect [35, 36]. As
demonstrated by the present studies, tasquinimod binds
to albumin with an affinity sufficient to result in such an
EPR effect. Thus despite its metabolism and limited tumor
vascular volume, an oral dose of tasquinimod producing
a nadir plasma concentration of only 0.5-1 μM albuminbound tasquinimod will result in cancer tissue levels in
the same range due to the EPR effect, Figure 3A&B.
Achieving these levels of the drug is critical because
the concentration necessary for inhibiting endothelial
sprouting was found to be in this range (IC50 ~ 0.5 μM),
Figure 4C.
Besides tumor endothelium becoming leaky,
as cancers outgrow their blood supply, the tumor
microenvironment becomes acidic, hypoxic, and low in
nutrients [1]. In this compromised (i.e., stressful) tumor
microenvironment, cancer cells initiate adaptive survival
pathways and activate an angiogenic switch [2]. Activation
of this switch by the cancer cells recruits infiltrating host
cells such as endothelial cells, myeloid- derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs), macrophages, and bone marrow derived
mesenchymal stem cells needed for the chronic stimulation
of tumor angiogenesis and cancer cell survival signaling

5A. These results demonstrated that on an equal dose
basis, tasquinimod is equipotent to its carboxamide-Ndemethylated metabolite which speaks against metabolism
being required for antitumor activity in vivo.
To confirm this conclusion, castrated male nude
mice were xenografted with the castrate resistant CWR22RH human prostate cancer tissue and the animals
immediately randomized into groups (n=10) which were:
1) left untreated as controls; 2) given daily oral treatment
with tasquinimod alone via the drinking water (10mg/kg/
day); 3) given oral ketoconazole alone via oral gavage
at a daily dose which inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4
(i.e., 25 mg/kg/day) [32]; or 4) given a combination of
the two drugs. The ability of this ketoconazole dosing
regimen to inhibit tasquinimod metabolism was validated
by the demonstration that it prolong (p<0.05) the plasma
clearance of tasquinimod, Figures 1B&C. These results
document that if chronic tasquinimod treatment was
initiated simultaneously with inoculation, instead of
initiating treatment when the cancers were already
established and growing, tasquinimod prevents tumor take
and subsequent malignant growth, Figure 5B. In contrast,
ketoconazole alone at a dose which inhibits tasquinimod
metabolism when given by itself does not inhibit either the
take or growth of the CWR-22RH human prostate cancer,
and when simultaneously combined with tasquinimod, it
does not inhibit the therapeutic efficacy of tasquinimod to
prevent initial tumor take, Figure 5B. These combined in
vitro/in vivo results document tasquinimod, not one of its
metabolites, is the active drug.

DISCUSSION
Chronic once daily oral dosing with tasquinimod
doubles the median progression-free survival and prolongs
survival of patients with metastatic, castrate resistant
prostate cancer in randomized prospective clinical trials
[15, 16]. These positive clinical results are produced
using an oral dose of tasquinimod of only 0.5-1 mg/day.
On a body weight basis, this translates into a daily dose
of only 7-14 μg/kg/day (i.e., 17-34 nmol/kg/day) which
maintains a plasma level of tasquinimod of ~ 0.5 μM with
a plasma half-life of 40 hours [13]. Tasquinimod can be
metabolized via CYP-3A4, Figure 1 C&D, to at least one
other compound (i.e., the carboxamide-N-demethylated
metabolite) which is 2-fold more potent in inhibiting
endothelial cells sprouting in vitro, Figure 4C. However,
the extent of production of this metabolite is too minor for
it to be the active drug, Figure 2B, since detectable levels
of this metabolite could not be found in the endothelial and
cancer cells responding to tasquinimod treatment either in
vitro or in vivo. This conclusion is further supported by the
observation that simultaneous combination treatment with
a dose of ketoconazole which completely inhibits CYP3A4 induced tasquinimod metabolism does not suppress
tasquinimod’s ability to inhibit endothelial “sprouting” in

in such a stressful tumor microenvironment [2-6]. Such
tumor angiogenesis requires HDAC4 and S100A9
dependent signaling in the cancer cells themselves as
well as in the infiltrating host cells [12, 18, 26]. Hence,
exposure of cancer and endothelial cells to 0.5-1μM
concentrations of tasquinimod will produce intracellular
levels of 2 to 3 µM or more than twenty-fold higher than
needed to bind and thus also inhibit HDAC4 and S100A9
[12, 18]. In summary, as schematically illustrated in Figure
5C, the proposed mechanism for tasquinimod’s potency
involves EPR facilitated delivery of albumin bound
drug via leaky vessels into the tumor microenvironment
lacking lymphatic drainage and the resulting uptake of
free compound into myeloid, endothelial and tumor cells
inhibiting HDAC4/S100A9 signaling uniquely activated
and required for survival and growth within the cancer, but
not in normal, tissue microenvironment.

Tasquinimod Plasma Pharmacokinetic and in vivo
Tissue and in vitro Cell Metabolism Assays

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Male nude mice bearing 200-300mm3 CWR-22Rv1
cancers were given 14C-labeled tasquinimod at a dose of 5
mg/kg via oral gavage. At times ranging from 30 min to 24
hour, groups of 4-6 mice were anaesthetized with ketamine
and 1 ml of heparinized blood collected by cardiac
puncture, followed by subsequent cardiac perfusion of
saline to remove blood associated drug. An aliquot of
liver, kidney, and cancer was removed, weighed and then
homogenized. The radioactivity in 10 μL aliquots of tissue
homogenates and blood plasma was determined using a
liquid scintillation counter and used to calculate the total
amount of tasquinimod plus its metabolites per gram of
tissue or per ml of blood. The remaining sample volume
was deproteinated with acetonitrile and the radioactivity of
an aliquot of the supernatant determined and the remaining
supernatant lyophilized, resuspended initially with 0.1mL
dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted by the addition of 0.9mL
deionized water prior to injection into the HPLC. The
HPLC system consisted of Waters pumps using a Waters
gradient controller to deliver mobile phase at a flow rate
of 1mL per minute using a Supelcosil ABZ+ C18 column
that is 150mm long by 4.6mm diameter and has 5μm
particle size. The metabolites were separated using a linear
gradient in which the starting mobile phase was 35%
acetonitrile: 65% water: 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
increasing to 50% acetonitrile: 50% water: 0.1%TFA over
25 minutes, and then increased rapidly to 98% acetonitrile:
2% water: 0.1%TFA and held until 33 minutes before
it is returned to the initial conditions for the next run.
Fractions were collected and the radioactivity determined
by scintillation counting. As controls, the individual
elution time of non-radiolabeled standard solutions of the
various tasquinimod metabolites was determined using
UV absorption at 215nm. The results were expressed as
concentration based upon tissue volume, assuming 1gram
wet weight equals 1ml, or normalized to tissue vascular

Reagents
Ketoconazole and bicalutamide (i.e., casodex) were
obtained from LKT Laboratories Inc. (St Paul, MN).
Unlabeled tasquinimod and 14C-tasquinimod labeled in the
3 position of the quinoline nucleus at a specific activity of
33.9 mCi/mmol (> 90% purity) were provided by Active
Biotech Inc. AB. Tasquinimod metabolites were prepared
at Active Biotech AB (Lund, Sweden) as previously
described [7, 12].

The source, history, and characteristics of the human
prostate cancer cell lines (i.e., LNCaP, LAPC4, and CWR22Rv1 and the human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
(HUVEC) used, as well as cell culture conditions for their
in vitro maintenance and the in vivo protocol for their
xenografting into immune-deficient nude male mice are
as described previously [7, 12]. The source, history, and
characteristics of the TRAMP-C2 mouse prostate cancer
line, as well as cell culture conditions for their in vitro
maintenance and the in vivo protocol for their growth in
intact adult male syngeneic C57Bl/6J are as described
previously [7]. All lines were mycoplasma negative using
the MycoSensor PCR Assay kit (Agilent Technologies)
and genetically authenticated within the last 6 months
using short tandem repeat profiling conducted by the
Johns Hopkins Genetic Resource Core Facility. The
source, history, and characteristics of the CWR-RH human
prostate cancer xenograft are as described previously [8].

Cellular Tasquinimod Uptake

volume.
For in vitro studies, cells were incubated with 1μM
14
C-labeled tasquinimod for indicated time period and then
the media and cells or cell nuclei separately harvested,
deproteinated with acetonitrile, and metabolites separated
by HPLC and quantitated as described above.

A rapid filtration method was developed and
validated to measures the kinetics of tasquinimod
cell uptake on a series of human cell lines. To do this,
exponentially growing cells in a tissue culture flask are
trypsinized, and the number of single cells counted and
their average diameter determined electronically using
Cellometer AutoT4 (Nexcelom, Lawrence, MA). Then
multiple replicates (N=3-6) of 107 cells per time point
were incubated from 5 minutes to 48 hours. at 37°C in
1ml of tissue culture media containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) plus 1µM 14C-labeled tasquinimod. The cells
in each replicate incubation were then rapidly separated
from the tasquinimod containing media by vacuum
filtration onto a 24mm Whatman GF/C glass microfiber
filter (GE Healthcare Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) using a
Millipore 1225 sampling manifold (Millipore, Billerica
MA). The filters are then rapidly washed and filtered (<20
seconds per wash) 3 times with 2mls of drug free FBS
containing tissue culture media. Half of the replicate filters
are then dried overnight and counted for determination
of the total cell associated amount of drug (i.e., plasma
membrane associated plus intracellular uptake). To the
remaining half of the replicate filters, 2mls of drug free
FBS containing tissue culture media is added above the
filters and allowed to remain there for 15 minutes before
being filtered off. This “wash off” treatment to remove
cell surface associated while retaining intracellular drug is
followed by three additional 2ml washes before the filters
are dried overnight and counted for the determination
of the total intracellular amount of drug. As controls,
sham filters without the presence of cells are treated and
processed similarly through the multiple washes and
then dried and counted. The appropriate control counts
are subtracted from both the whole cell and intracellular
counts. These corrected radioactivity values are then
converted into tasquinimod amount which are then divided
by the total volume of 107 cells (i.e., determined using
the average cell diameter for each cell line) to determine
the total cell associated concentration of drug [CAt] vs.
total intracellular amount of drug (ICt) at the indicated
time point. The total plasma membrane associated drug
concentration (PMt) is determined by subtracting the ICt
from the CAt value.
To specifically determine the concentration of
tasquinimod within the cell nucleus, 107 cells were
incubated in 1ml of tissue culture media containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus 1µM 14C-labeled
tasquinimod for varying times before the cells were
centrifuged rapidly (i.e., 1000xG for 2 min) to remove the
drug containing media. The cells were rapidly resuspended
in phosphate buffered saline and exposed to pressurized
(i.e., 500lbs/sq in) N2 in a nitrogen cavitation devise (i.e.,
Parr bomb, Parr Instrument Company, Moline, Il) for 5
min before the plasma membranes were lysed by the rapid

Determination of Protein Binding Fraction (PBF)
Mice were orally gavaged with 14C-labeled
tasquinimod at a dose of 5mg/kg and 1 hour later blood
collected and plasma isolated and the PBF determined
as described previously [40] using Centrifree® YM-30
centrifuge filter unit with a molecular weight cutoff of 30K
(i.e., Millipore, Billerica,MO).

Determination of Dissociation Constant for
Binding to Albumin
To determine whether albumin is the tasquinimod
binding protein in plasma, albumin was removed from
human plasma using an albumin depletion kit (Thermo
Scientific cat # 85160). The albumin depleted plasma
was then tested for its protein binding as described above.
The dissociation constant (kd) for tasquinimod binding
was determined based upon equilibrium dialysis of a
mixture of 4mg/ml of the species (i.e., human, bovine, and
mouse) specific albumin obtained from Sigma with 2μM
of 14C-labeled tasquinimod in PBS pH 7.4 buffer using
a 96-well equilibrium dialyzer™ (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston,MA).
To identify the binding site of tasquinimod to
albumin, the dose-response ability of a typical albumin
domain IB ligand (i.e., bicalutamide [33]) vs. a typical
domain IIB ligand (i.e., phenylbutazone [32]) vs. a typical
site II ligands (i.e., ibuprofen [32]) to compete with 14C
-labeled tasquinimod binding to mouse albumin was
determined using equilibrium dialysis as described above.

Determination of the Enhanced Permeability and
Retention (EPR) Effect
EPR effect was determined using Evans Blue as
described previously [34] with the modification that 24
hours after the albumin in the blood of tumor bearing nude
mice was labeled via IV injection of Evans Blue (EB) at
a dose of 10mg/kg, the animals were anesthetized, blood
collected, and then animals were perfused with saline to
remove blood from the host tissues before harvesting liver,
kidney, and prostate cancer xenograft tissue. The results
are expressed as the concentration of EB-labeled albumin
retained in the blood or specified tissue.

>98% of the cells without disrupting either mitochondria
or lysosomes. The lysate was then centrifuged at 800Gx
2 minutes to restrictively pellet only cell nuclei. The
radioactivity of this pellet was counted and used to
calculate the total amount of tasquinimod associated
with 107 cell nuclei. To determine the nuclear drug
concentration, this total nuclear drug amount was driving
by the total volume of 107 cell nuclei determined from the
average diameter of the nuclei determined electronically
using Cellometer AutoT4.
