Abstract
During the last decades, the knowledge of cell death
mechanisms involved in anticancer therapy has grown exponentially. However, in many studies, cell death is still
described in an incomplete manner. The frequent use of
indirect proliferation assays, unspeciﬁc probes, or bulk analyses leads too often to misunderstandings regarding cell death
events. There is a trend to focus on molecular or genetic
regulations of cell demise without a proper characterization

of the phenotype that is the object of this study. Sometimes,
cancer researchers can feel overwhelmed or confused when
faced with such a corpus of detailed insights, nomenclature
rules, and debates about the accuracy of a particular probe or
assay. On the basis of the information available, we propose
a simple guide to distinguish forms of cell death in experimental settings using cancer cell lines. Cancer Res; 75(6); 913–7.

Introduction

Nevertheless, as an organized combination of morphologic and
molecular descriptors, cell death nomenclature rules are the
best frame we have to study cell demise (6).
In the development of the nomenclature consensus, there is a
clear trend to embrace new molecular descriptors as the unique
determinants for cell death mechanism attribution (4, 6).
Comprehensive efforts have been carried out to organize the
growing number of cell death players into hierarchically distributed signaling pathways (5, 7, 8). Despite recognizing the
importance of the newly available biochemical tests, we advocate here for a cell death characterization without denying the
old morphologic criteria. This defense of morphologic criteria
has not to be viewed as a reductionist approach. Taxonomists
use genetics or molecular characters to identify the varieties
within a clearly recognizable genus and species. We consider
that the important biochemical differences reported do not
invalidate a higher division of cell death mechanisms, in which
apoptosis and necrosis are considered to be major types,
without denying the existence of several other minor or particular mechanisms.
We concisely present the current knowledge about cell death
mechanisms involved in cancer therapy. However, the aim of
the present review is to provide a guide about how to face
accurately the description of cell death mechanisms when
challenging the tumor cell physiology with different stimuli.
For reasons of brevity, we focus on in vitro assays, as an accurate
in vitro characterization could help to better design in vivo
preclinical models.

The main purpose of current anticancer therapies is to induce
the speciﬁc removal of tumor cells without compromising the
overall patient health. It soon became clear that the speciﬁc
modality of cell death triggered could be of key importance to
interpret treatment-related side effects, to understand therapeutic failure, and to help in generating patient cohorts based on
their predicted sensibility to a speciﬁc agent (1–3). Our knowledge about cell death mechanisms (particularly at a molecular
level) has evolved into a sophisticated body of knowledge with
its own jargon, sometimes difﬁcult to understand for nonspecialists. Since the beginning of the 21st century, a group of
major research leaders in the ﬁeld have been proposing and
upgrading comprehensive nomenclature guidelines based on
reliable markers and new developments in the ﬁeld of cell
death (4, 5).
However, those efforts have not stopped the increasing
number of new cell death mechanisms described, some of
them circumscribed to a very particular stimulus or cell type.
We lack a proper characterization of which molecular modules
are basal and which are derivates, meaning that nomenclature
does not represent an attempt to provide a biologic classiﬁcation of cell death modes based on phylogenetic relationships.

Cell Death Mechanisms
The major form of cell death is called apoptosis because the
dismantling of a cell in tiny detached pieces reminded Kerr,
Willie, and Currie the leaves falling from the autumn trees
(9). Apoptosis is a highly organized physiologic process by
which a cell demolishes itself (10, 11). Within the body,

apoptosis occurs continuously under physiologic conditions.
Almost every step during apoptosis is ﬁnely orchestrated; it is a
"clean" kind of death as the remnants (apoptotic bodies) are
engulfed and recycled by neighboring cells, and generally it
does not trigger inﬂammation (12, 13). In contrast, in cell
cultures, apoptotic bodies are frequently identiﬁable for days
after the challenge.
A complex molecular organization ensures the apoptotic
demise. It is highly organized in different steps; any level ampliﬁes
the previous one, but internally undesired activations are prevented by sophisticated balances with inhibitor elements (10,
11). Multiple external signals and inner stimuli could serve as
triggers. Many mediators have been identiﬁed, but the Bcl-2
family of proteins still keeps its central role, determining the
initialization of the ﬁnal apoptotic phase, executed by the caspase
family of proteases (12).
The so-called mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is involved in
reacting to stress or environmental signals (10, 14). This intrinsic
pathway is characterized by the role of the mitochondria as
encounter point of most of its initiators and mediators. The
mitochondrial outer membrane is the place where the members
of the three branches of the Bcl-2 family play their role. The
multidomain proapoptotic members of the family (Bax and Bak)
control this pathway by generating a pore at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Through this pore, signaling proteins (such as
cytochrome c) are released into the cytoplasm, leading to the
activation of executioner caspases. For this pore to be formed,
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins must be inactivated by BH3-only
proteins, which also activate Bax and Bak. BH3-only proteins act
as real sentinels of key cellular processes (ranging from correct
gene expression to adequate cytoskeleton organization) and are
activated in different ways (production, release, modiﬁcation,
etc.; ref. 15).
A second major apoptotic pathway is induced by the death
receptors. Death ligands, which are cytokines of the TNF superfamily, interact with transmembrane receptors whose inner
domains serve as sites for the recruitment of different adaptor
proteins. The signaling cascade leads to the activation of caspase8, the main mediator of this pathway (16). Caspase-8 cleaves and
directly activates caspase-3 or it engages the mitochondrial pathway via the BH3-only protein Bid.
Some authors distinguish other apoptotic pathways, but those
are rather trigger-speciﬁc variants than actual new mechanisms.
An example is detachment-induced apoptosis, which has been
traditionally termed anoikis (6). However, as with other types of
stress, the onset of cell death is produced through BH3-only
proteins and the mitochondrial pathway (17).
In clear contrast with the attention paid to apoptosis during
the last decades, necrosis has suffered continuous ins and outs
from the primary scientiﬁc focus. Long regarded as a mere
accidental cellular explosion, it is now widely accepted that
some forms of necrosis are regulated and executed by speciﬁc
molecular machineries (8, 18). Furthermore, our knowledge
about regulated necrosis is undergoing a boom in the recent
years with a series of newly described cell death mechanisms
(such as necroptosis and pyroptosis) that share the necrotic
phenotype and basic biochemical descriptors (loss of plasma
membrane barrier, water inﬂux, swelling, and cell rupture with
cytoplasmic content release). Despite these general similarities,
the individualization of each regulated necrosis type is rooted
in important signaling particularities (19–21).

Among the phenomena described that do not ﬁt into
morphologic apoptosis or necrosis, we want to comment
brieﬂy the particular case represented by "autophagic cell
death" (ACD). ACD describes circumstances in which autophagy exert such an important role in cell death that its
inhibition impedes its onset. The exact nature and relevance
of ACD have been disputed for long, but the most recent
ﬁndings point to some relevance in therapeutically induced
cell death (5, 22).

Assessing Cell Death Mechanisms in
Experimental Settings
The correct evaluation of cell death in every experimental
setting related to cancer research is a must. A large number of
valuable techniques could provide insights into cell death
mechanisms, from microscopic observations to high-throughput
quantitative assays (7, 18, 23). Our aim is to provide a series of
guidelines of "good practices" for a reliable, quick assessment of
cell death.
The ﬁrst test comes with the simple observation of the cells
under the cell culture room's bright-ﬁeld microscope (Fig. 1).
Observations will indicate whether the treated cells are actively
dying (accumulation of cell remnants or formation of a population of detached and shrunk cells), blocked in their cell cycle
(changes in the mitotic fraction or the rising of a giant cell
population), or simply not growing as much as the controls.
The isolation and staining of the detached cell population with
DNA-binding dyes (such as DAPI, PI, or Hoechst-33342) could
reveal the presence of typically apoptotic condensed and fragmented nuclei (karyorrhexis). Afterward, cationic dye exclusion
assays (such as Trypan blue) are useful to quantify cell death
scores.
An accurate observation could provide better information
than cell-impedance sensors or metabolic proliferation tests
(7). Impedance sensors can be fooled when cell morphology or
plasma membrane potential changes drastically. MTT-like
assays are indirect tests based on metabolic processes that could
be affected by other cellular processes and be confused with
growth arrest (and they are also quite susceptible to mycoplasma contaminations; ref. 23). However, once the exact nature of
the induced process (cell death triggering vs. proliferation
arrest) has been identiﬁed, both methods can provide reliable
quantiﬁcations.
Despite powerful, it is important to understand that morphologic criteria are no longer sufﬁcient as descriptors of cell
death modalities. Researchers should provide valid biochemical data (Fig. 1) before attributing the observed phenotype to a
mechanism of cell death (5, 6). To distinguish apoptosis from
necrosis, the addition of caspase inhibitors (for instance
Z-VAD-fmk or Q-VD-OPh) could provide useful information,
as they should inhibit apoptotic cell death features and at least
postpone membrane permeabilization, although not indeﬁnitely (24, 25). Another way for a clear mitochondrial apoptosis identiﬁcation is to test our experimental conditions in a
model that overexpresses one of the multidomain antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins: cell death could not be possible or the
phenotype should clearly change into a necrotic one (7). The
best way to assess the precise involvement of the cell death
receptors is, in our opinion, to repress its expression or signaling in the cell cultures when the treatment is performed. This

characterization of cell death is better addressed by the use, when available, of a speciﬁc inhibitor (top right). Several tests could be used afterward

might be done by using chemical inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies or gene-targeted means.
The next logical step is trying to quantify more ﬁnely the
extent of cell death. Annexin V–propidium iodide (AnnV-PI)
measurements by ﬂow cytometry are probably the most common assay. This test is performed in living cells, and it is based
on the ﬂip of phosphatidyl-serine (PS) residues to the outer
layer of the plasma membrane (recognized by AnnV) and the
inﬂux of PI to the cells that have lost the plasma membrane
barrier. Thus, the test is able to discriminate among early
apoptotic cells (AnnVþ PI), necrotic cells (AnnV PIþ), and
late apoptotic cells (AnnVþ PIþ). The major setback of this
method is the possibility that the double positive staining
(both AnnV and PI) could really represent primary necrotic
cells (AnnV recognizing inner PS residues) rather than apoptotic cells that underwent secondary necrosis (26). Mitochondrial
potential sensitive vital dyes (such as TMRM, DiOC6(3), and
JC-1) can be used in a similar manner. Cells with low mitochondrial staining and impermeable to PI could be considered

early apoptotic events (26, 27). However, caution is advised as
some forms of necrosis can present with mitochondrial depolarization (28). Quantiﬁcation of the sub-G1 fraction in cellcycle proﬁles (with PI or other DNA-binding dyes) is an easy
way to score apoptotic events but should be discouraged when
the treatment courses with transient or long-standing episodes
of G2–M blockages or even sustained tetraploidization. Those
cells start to degrade their genomic material when they possess
a greater amount of DNA, so it takes them more time to reach
the sub-G1 levels. In any case, it would be wise to make
different endpoint quantiﬁcations to understand better the
dynamics of cell death. When accessible, new ﬂow-cytometry
platforms equipped for simultaneous imaging of events could
provide really useful data (29).
Biochemical characterization of apoptosis can be enhanced
by the use of common techniques, such as Western blotting for
the detection of typically apoptotic cleaved proteins (PARP and
caspase-3) or ﬂuorescent immunolabeling and imaging of
proteins like cytochrome c (contained in the mitochondria in

healthy cells and released from them upon apoptotic commitment) or Bax (the other way around). As the major ﬁnal
executioner of the apoptotic demise, different caspase activation assays are available for microscopy, Western blotting,
colorimetry, or ﬂow cytometry (23). Morphologic analysis can
be completed with more powerful imaging by electron microscopy, showing in detail the marked differences between the
solid apoptotic cells and the ghostly appearance of the necrotic
remnants (7, 18).
Much of the literature still focuses on apoptotic detection and
description, but there is a recent increase in the interest of assessing necrosis, particularly regulated necrosis (8). Morphologically, necrosis is clearly identiﬁed under microscopic observations,
especially in transmission and scanning electron microscopy
(Fig. 1). Swollen and disorganized cytoplasm (oncosis) and the
perforated plasma membrane are easily visualized as major
hallmarks of late necrosis (7, 18). When the involvement of
necrosis is supposed, early endpoint observations should be
performed, as necrosis is a rather quick mechanism of cell demise.
Early necrosis can be recognized under the inverted microscope
by the formation of bubbles in the plasma membrane by the
water inﬂux resulted from the injury. Those bubbles are distinct
from the apoptotic blebs, as the necrotic ones are mainly aqueous
in nature whereas the apoptotic blebs are full of cellular content.
Bubbles tend to converge and form one single structure as water
continues to enter the cell, before it detaches, breaking the plasma
membrane apart (18). Biochemically, necrosis detection has been
performed by the measurement of cytosolic enzymes released
to the culture media when the plasma membrane is broken. The
recently described processes of regulated necrosis open the possibility of using speciﬁc inhibitors, such as necrostatin-1, to
identify necroptosis (the regulated necrosis pathway that requires
RIPKs and MLKL; refs. 7, 23).
There is also an increasing attention in the community to ﬁnd
better ways to clearly characterize the events of ACD, although not
many inducers have been described (30). To clearly identify cell
demise as ACD, there should be an increase in autophagic ﬂux
accompanied with a necrotic phenotype (as autophagy can lead to
apoptosis) and vacuolated cytoplasm. Inhibition or silencing of
autophagy-related proteins should prevent this form of cell death
(6, 30).
Finally, we encourage the community to include long-term
experiments in their in vitro settings. Even when minimal, the
surviving fraction of cells could give rise to a resistant subpopulation by simple selection of preexisting characters (i.e., expression of membrane pumps able to reject the uptake of the challenging drug) or by enhanced evolutionary change (i.e., induction
of mitotic catastrophe leading to major genomic rearrangements)
stimulated by the treatment itself (31, 32). A simple washout of
the cells after a determined endpoint, followed by observation of
cell culture regrowth and another repetition of the experiment,

could provide clues about the ability of tumor cells to escape cell
death. The measurement of DNA content, karyotyping, or gene
expression assays will generate valuable data about how the
surviving cells manage to evolve and resist.

Concluding Remarks
Cell death induction is the main aim of almost every anticancer therapeutic approach either approved, under evaluation,
or still in research. However, not all cell deaths share the same
characters, and the differences could be crucial. Necrosis induction is generally very effective, but the release of cytoplasmic
content leads to undesired inﬂammation processes. Apoptosis
is comparatively clean, but its highly regulated onset leaves a
wide space for therapeutic resistance (1, 3). In a more general
point of view, the knowledge of the processes involved in the
induction of tumor cell clearance will help to provide susceptibility markers and to stratify patients. One example of the
possibilities of the detailed characterization of cell death
mechanisms is the identiﬁcation of certain apoptotic processes
that could combine their noninﬂammatory nature with the
precise exhibition of signals that lead to lymphocyte recruitment and immune response. This process, so-called immunogenic cell death, is thought to provide tremendous progress in
future anticancer research and treatment (3).
It is crucial to unveil the precise molecular signaling networks underlying cell death phenotypes, but that effort has to
be rooted in a complete assessment that includes a detailed
description of the sequence of events involved both in the short
and in the long term. Following that way, researchers will have
more reliable data, planning much better the animal experiments and moving toward preclinical experimentation based
on a more solid ground.
