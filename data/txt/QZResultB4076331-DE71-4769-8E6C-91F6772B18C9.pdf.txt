Administration of depleting anti-NKR-P1c/NK1.1 monoclonal
antibody completely abrogated the tumoricidal activity induced
by the combination of Gleevec/STI571 and IL-2, suggesting a role
for NK1.1 expressing cells.
Immunohistochemistry of regressing lung metastases in Gleevec/
STI571+IL-2–treated mice revealed prominent infiltrates of CD11c+
cells in tumor beds and in surrounding parenchyma, suggesting that
DC might be critical effectors of the antitumor effects achieved with
the combination therapy (Fig. 1). We further did cytofluorometric
analyses of single cell suspensions obtained from lung metastases.
Classic NK cells defined as CD3 B220 NK1.1+ cells represented
about 4 F 2% of tumor-infiltrating cells and were not significantly
expanded by the combination therapy, whereas the number of
CD11c+ cells increased 2- to 3-fold in response to Gleevec/STI571+IL2. Among those CD11c+ cells, classic plasmacytoid DC (pDC)
coexpressing CD11c, B220 and Gr1 molecules represented not more
than 3% of tumor-infiltrating CD11c+ cells. Importantly, the majority
(72 F 5%) of tumor-infiltrating CD11c+ cells expressed B220 but
lacked Ly6C/Gr1, and all tumor-infiltrating CD11c+ cells that
expressed NK1.1 molecules were Gr1 negative. Therefore, we focused
our further investigation on the subset of CD11c+ cells coexpressing
B220 and NK1.1 molecules.
The subset of CD11c+B220+NK1.1+Gr1 cells (later called IKDC)
increased 4-fold during treatment with Gleevec/STI571+IL-2 (Fig. 1)
and coexpressed other NK cell markers such as CD49b/Dx5, CD122,
NKG2D, CD11b, and Ly49, but failed to express CD3, CD4, CD8a,
CD25, PDCA-1, and costimulatory molecules. Because up to 50% of
the CD11c+B220+NK1.1+/CD49b+ cells coexpressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II in tumors, we hypothesized that
these CD11c+ cells would belong to the DC lineage.

Abstract
A unique class of IFN-producing killer dendritic cells (IKDC)
resembling natural killer cells has been defined that can
recognize and lyse tumor cells through a tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand–dependent mechanism. IKDC may mediate the host-dependent antitumor
activity of Gleevec/STI571 and other therapeutics that can
inhibit the c-kit tyrosine kinase. IKDC represent an important
new component of the innate immune system responding to
cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):851–3]

Introduction
Complete and permanent success of cancer therapy depends on
the targeting of all tumor cells (including cancer stem cells) or,
alternatively, on the direct removal of a part of the tumor, escorted
by a ‘‘bystander effect’’ in which the immune system recognizes,
attacks, and eradicates remaining tumor cells. Our group found two
examples of such a bystander effect promoted by immune cells. First,
anthracycline-treated tumor cells could elicit a dendritic cell (DC)mediated cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response that conferred stable longterm protection against rechallenge with the same tumor (1). This
effect depended on the apoptogenic agent, on the form of cell death,
on the innate immune system, as well as on the cognate immune
system. Second, inhibition of the c-kit tyrosine kinase by the
paradigmatic anticancer drug, Gleevec/STI571, could endow DC with
natural killer (NK) cell stimulatory capacity in mice and humans,
leading to prolonged survival in patients bearing gastrointestinal
sarcoma (2). In attempting to dissect the immune mechanisms
leading to drug-induced tumor rejection, we recently discovered a
new player in innate immunity that we called ‘‘IFN-producing killer
dendritic cells’’ (IKDC), for its ability to produce IFNg and to
recognize tumor cells that are resistant to classic NK cells (3).

Phenotype and Morphology of IKDC
In naı̈ve mice, this new distinct cell population, defined as
CD11c+B220+NK1.1+/CD49b+ cells, represented about 1% to 2% of all
splenic CD11c+ cells and was detected in all lymphoid organs,
including blood, liver, gut, lung, and skin (3, 4). We could find those
cells in several inbred mouse strains, including in Rag / IL-2Rg /
mice (where they lack NK1.1 molecules but express CD11c, B220, and
CD49b), but not in IL-2/IL-15 receptor h chain–deficient
mice (3). The phenotypic and functional characterization of
CD11c+B220+NK1.1+/CD49b+ prompted us and our colleagues to
call the new cell ‘‘IKDC,’’ for reasons explained below.
Analyses using light microscopy and transmission electron
microscopy highlighted that freshly isolated IKDC have a unique
morphology. IKDC do not resemble pDC (with their developed and
pathognomonic endoplasmic reticulum), display a smooth plasma
membrane with small pseudopodia, a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio
and a dense cytoplasm containing few mitochondria but numerous
granules (Fig. 1; refs. 3, 4).

Key Findings Leading to the Discovery of IKDC
As recently reported, c-kit tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as
Gleevec/STI571 can stimulate a host-dependent antitumor activity
involving myeloid DC-primed NK cells (2). With the aim of further
improving the NK cell–mediated antitumor effect induced by
Gleevec/STI571, we combined Gleevec/STI571 with interleukin 2
(IL-2) and observed enhanced antitumor effects against B16F10
melanoma lung metastases, as compared with either agent alone.

Figure 1. The multistep process leading to the discovery of IKDC in mice. Immunotherapy based on the combination of Gleevec/STI571+IL-2 promoted the
NK.1.1-dependent tumor growth retardation in the B16F10 tumor model. Immunohistochemistry studies of regressing lung metastases revealed extensive recruitment
and/or proliferation of CD11c+ cells. Flow cytometry analyses of lung metastases gating on CD11c+ cells revealed that they coexpressed B220 and NK1.1, but not
Gr1, and analyses in blood and spleen showed an increase of this cell population under treatment. Light microscopy (May Grünwald Giemsa) and electron microscopy
of IKDC highlighted their small size, the high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, and the abundance of granules in the cytoplasm.

Role of IKDC in Tumor Immunotherapy

that block the proapoptotic signal transduction complex initiated
via death receptors (such as the dominant-negative mutant for
Fas-associated death domain or the cowpox virus caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA) were resistant to this combination therapy in vivo.

Death receptors were found to be involved in the tumoricidal
activity promoted by the combination therapy using Gleevec/
STI571+IL-2. B16F10 tumor cells manipulated to express proteins

IFN-Producing Killer Dendritic Cells

However, the combination therapy maintained a significant
antitumor activity in TNF / mice. Conversely, the efficacy of
Gleevec/STI571+IL-2 was completely abolished in mice treated with
a neutralizing antimouse tumour necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) antibody (Ab), establishing the pivotal role
of TRAIL in the tumoricidal activity. After the combination therapy
with Gleevec/STI571+IL-2, we detected the membrane expression of
TRAIL on splenic IKDC and NK cells. Tumor cells transfected with
CrmA were not significantly killed by IKDC, underlining the
importance of death-receptor signaling for its antitumor activity.
Furthermore, our TRAIL-blocking experiments in vitro confirmed
that tumor killing was mainly dependent on TRAIL.
Because we found that both IKDC and NK cells could kill in a
TRAIL-dependent manner, we investigated whether one of these
cell types might be capable to prevent tumor outgrowth in effectordeprived hosts such as B16F10-bearing Rag / IL-2Rg / mice.
When B220+NK1.1+CD49b+ (IKDC) versus B220 NK1.1+CD49b+
(NK) cells from Gleevec/STI571+IL-2–treated mice were inoculated
into established B16F10 tumors, only IKDC could significantly
impair tumor outgrowth. Similar findings were achieved when
Dx5+I-Ab+ cells were adoptively transferred into tumor beds (3).
As TRAIL expression is controlled by IFN type II (5), we further
examined the regulation of IFNg secretion by IKDC and NK cells.
Strikingly, IKDC stimulated in vitro with tumor cells produced large
amounts of IFNg. Stimulation of IKDC with Gleevec/STI571+IL-2
also resulted in the secretion of IFNg. Remarkably, IKDC could
produce IFNg in response to a broad array of allogeneic or syngeneic
transformed cells except the transporter for antigen processing–
deficient RMA-S cells, whereas NK cells failed to do so in the absence
of exogenous stimulation, albeit exhibiting lytic activity against
RMA-S. It is of note that IKDC did not secrete IFNg in contact with
healthy tissues such as primary hepatocyte or thymocyte cultures.
In conclusion, IKDC might mediate their tumoricidal activity by
IFNg secretion and TRAIL-dependent direct tumor cell lysis.

The current paradigm for T cell priming following tissue
destruction relies on a two-step process whereby the tumor cell
death event is somewhat dissociated from the antigen presentation in lymph nodes. Hence, apoptotic tumor cells might
release endogenous danger signals that could activate conventional DC (cDC). The CTL or NK attack of tumors could liberate
tumor antigens available for cDC and promote the translocation
or secretion of endogenous alarmins that could activate
surrounding cDC (7). Alternatively, a one-step process could
be envisioned in which a single cell would be able to kill tumor
targets, uptake apoptotic debris, and initiate its differentiation
towards a bona fide antigen-presenting cell. Such a scenario is
conceivable because Chan et al. showed that IKDC express
L-selectin and CCR7 and can traffic from blood to T cell areas of
lymphoid organs, where they exhibit a DC phenotype (losing
NKG2D and acquiring CD40; ref. 4). Previous reports alluded to
some DC subtypes endowed with cytolytic functions in humans
and rodents. In the RIP-LCMV mouse model of virally induced
diabetes, Homann et al. identified a subset of ‘‘NK/DC,’’ defined
as CD11c+CD49b+ cells, capable of preventing autoimmune
disease in the setting of anti-CD40L blocking Ab (8). Pillarisetty
et al. reported of NK/DC, defined as CD11c+NK1.1+ cells, with
simultaneous NK and DC functions (9). However, the precise
nature of the cell capable of both, killing and antigen presentation, has not been established before we published our study.
Second, our data suggest that the combination therapy with
Gleevec/STI571+IL-2 (which involves IKDC that trigger TRAILdependent apoptosis of tumor cells) could be implemented in
the clinic, in particular, in TRAIL-sensitive cancers that are
resistant to the direct antiproliferative effect of Gleevec/STI571.
Consequently, identifying the human counterparts of mouse
IKDC remains an important challenge.
Third, the implication of the host immune system in
antitumor effects mediated by chemo- or radiotherapy is being
actively investigated (10). Certain cell death modalities might
electively trigger innate and/or adaptive immune responses,
thus eliciting an antitumor response mediated by the host
(1, 11). The challenge is now to transpose these data to the
human system and to decipher the exact role of IKDC in the
immune system’s fight against cancer.

Chief Implications
This review describes the discovery of a novel DC subset called
IKDC, a multitasking chimera sharing the phenotypic and
functional properties of both DC and NK cells (3, 4, 6). Indeed,
lytic IKDC express MHC class II and CD86 molecules and secrete
large amounts of IFNg in contact with transformed cells (whereas
NK cells fail to do so). IKDC display the cardinal feature of DC,
i.e., the capacity of antigen presentation following activation with
TLR9 ligands as published by Chan et al., who characterized and
described IKDC in parallel to our group in BALB/c mouse (4).
These data open up the following prospects:

First, we propose that IKDC constitute a privileged link
between the innate and cognate arms of antitumor immunity.
