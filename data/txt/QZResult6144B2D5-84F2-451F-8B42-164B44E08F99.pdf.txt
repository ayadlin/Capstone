Abstract
12,14

The cyclopentenone 15-deoxy-#
-prostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2) inhibits proliferation of cancer cells, including breast
cancers, by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-;
(PPAR;)–dependent and PPAR;-independent mechanisms.
However, little is known about its effect on the transcriptional
activity of estrogen receptor-A (ERA) that plays vital roles in
the growth of breast cancers. Here, we show that 15d-PGJ2
inhibits both 17B-estradiol (E2)–dependent and E2-independent ERA transcriptional activity by PPAR;-independent
mechanism. In addition, 15d-PGJ2 directly modifies ERA
protein via its reactive cyclopentenone moiety, evidenced
by incorporation of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 into ERA, both
in vitro and in vivo. Nanoflow reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis identifies two
cysteines (Cys227 and Cys240) within the COOH-terminal zinc
finger of ERA DNA-binding domain (DBD) as targets for
covalent modification by 15d-PGJ2. Gel mobility shift and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that 15d-PGJ2
inhibits DNA binding of ERA and subsequent repression
of ERA target gene expression, such as pS2 and c-Myc.
Therefore, our results suggest that 15d-PGJ2 can block ERA
function by covalent modification of cysteine residues within
the vulnerable COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERA DBD,
resulting in fundamental inhibition of both hormonedependent and hormone-independent ERA transcriptional
activity. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2595–602]

Introduction
15-Deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a cyclopentenone
PG, is a naturally occurring derivative of PGD2 and acts as an
endogenous ligand for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPARg; refs. 1, 2). Growth-inhibitory
effects of endogenous and synthetic PPARg agonists have been
shown in several tumors and cancer cell lines, including breast,
colon, prostate, and lung cancers (3–8). The antitumorigenic

effects of PPARg agonists are caused by induction of cell
cycle arrest, apoptosis, or differentiation through both PPARgdependent and PPARg-independent mechanisms. They can
induce cell cycle regulatory genes and inhibit genes involved in
cell cycle progression or antiapoptotic proteins (8–11). In addition,
15d-PGJ2 has been shown to interfere with the intracellular growthpromoting signaling through covalent modification of cysteines
of target proteins such as InB kinase, nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB),
and activator protein-1 (AP-1), independently of PPARg activation
(12–14). J series of PGs, including 15d-PGJ2, unlike other classes of
PGs are characterized by the presence of a reactive a,h-unsaturated
carbonyl group in the cyclopentenone ring. This moiety confers
15d-PGJ2 the capability to form covalent adducts with thiols of
cysteine residues in target proteins by Michael’s addition, resulting
in an alteration of protein function (12–15). Therefore, the growth
inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 on tumor cells can be mediated in
part by this highly reactive cyclopentenone moiety, independently of
PPARg activation.
Estrogen receptors (ERa and ERh) are members of the steroid
nuclear receptor superfamily that are hormone-regulated transcription factors and mediate the effects of estrogens and
antiestrogens in breast cancers (16–19). ERa consists of several
distinct functional domains: DNA-binding domain (DBD),
ligand-binding domain (LBD), and transactivation domain. The
NH2-terminal domain of ERa contains a constitutive and ligandindependent transcriptional activation function (AF-1). The
activity of AF-1 domain can be regulated by growth factors, such
as insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor
(EGF), and transforming growth factor-a, via signal transduction
cascades (20–24). The COOH-terminal LBD is a hydrophobic
structure responsible for specific interactions with agonists and
antagonists. The middle DBD contains two nonequivalent Cys4
zinc fingers critical for binding to short palindromic nucleotide
sequences called estrogen response element (ERE) in the target
gene promoters. These two zinc fingers in ERa DBD function
cooperatively in ERa dimerization and DNA binding (25, 26). In
addition, the COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERa is structurally
disordered, and the cysteine thiols of this zinc finger have been
characterized as particularly susceptible to the attack of
electrophilic agents such as 2,2¶-dithiobisbenzamide-1 and benzisothiazolone (27–29).
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among western
women, and f70% of breast cancer patients are positive for ERa
(30, 31). Current therapeutic strategy to treat ERa-positive breast
cancer is based on the blockade of ERa transcriptional activity by
selective ER modulators (SERM) such as tamoxifen. SERMs act as
receptor-binding competitors of estrogens and block the effects of

estrogens. However, this antiestrogen therapy using tamoxifen is
limited due to its partial estrogenic effects in endometrial cancers
and resistance to its effects (20–22, 32). Moreover, crosstalk
between ERa and growth factor signaling pathways, such as EGF
and IGF-I, is postulated to be a critical factor especially in the
mechanism of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer (20–24).
In this study, we show that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits 17h-estradiol (E2)–
dependent and E2-independent ERa transcriptional activity by
PPARg-independent mechanism. We also show that 15d-PGJ2
covalently modifies two cysteines in the vulnerable COOH-terminal
zinc finger of ERa DBD and disrupts of the ERa zinc finger,
resulting in inhibition of ERa DNA binding. In addition to defining
the molecular mechanism underlying ERa inhibition by 15d-PGJ2,
our results validate targeting the vulnerable cysteines in the COOHterminal zinc finger of ERa DBD by covalent modification or
electrophilic attack as a means of disrupting hormone- and growth
factor–mediated transactivation of ERa.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and plasmids. 15d-PGJ 2 and 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ 2
(CAY10410) were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).
GW9662, E2, and rhIGF-I were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA),
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN),
respectively. The ERa and h-actin antibodies were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Formic acid and trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) were obtained from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI). High-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)–grade acetonitrile was from EM Science
(Darmstadt, Germany). ERE-tk-Luc, PPRE-tk-Luc, and expression vector for
PPARg (29) and ERh expression plasmid (33) were described previously.
Cell culture and transient transfection assay. The human breast
carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 (ERa+, ERh+) and MDA-MB-231 (ERa , ERh+)
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained with DMEM, supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus antibiotics. In experiments with E2
and 15d-PGJ2, cells were cultured in phenol red–free (PRF) DMEM
supplemented with 0.5% charcoal-dextran–stripped FBS (CS-FBS; Hyclone,
Logan, UT). Transient transfection assays were done using the FuGENE6
reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells (4–8  104 per well) were split in 24-well
plates the day before transfection in PRF DMEM supplemented with 10% CSFBS. Twenty-four hours after transfection, medium was changed with PRF
DMEM containing 0.5% CS-FBS. Cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle) or
various concentrations of 15d-PGJ2, CAY10410, or GW9662 together with or
without E2 for 5 h and harvested for luciferase and h-galactosidase assays.
The luciferase activity was normalized by h-galactosidase activity.
Proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was examined by measuring DNA
synthesis using tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake. Cells were grown in
PRF DMEM supplemented with 10% CS-FBS for 3 to 5 days. Quiescent cells
(1  104 per well) were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates in 200 AL of
growth media, containing 0.5% CS-FBS with or without E2 together with
DMSO or various concentration of 15d-PGJ2 or CAY10410. After 68 h, cells
were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (0.5 ACi/100 AL) for 4 h, and [3H]thymidine
incorporation was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting.
Preparation of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2. The carboxyl group of 15d-PGJ2
was modified by amidation with EZ-link 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (Pierce,
Rockford, IL) by an alternate mixed anhydride procedure. Briefly, triethylamine and isobutyl chloroformate were added to a solution of 15d-PGJ2 in
anhydrous dichloromethane, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 30 min. Solvent was removed in vacuo, and a solution of
5-(biotinamido)pentylamine in N,N-dimethylformamide was added followed
by 4-dimethylaminopyridine in N,N-dimethylformamide, and the mixture
was stirred overnight at room temperature. Biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 was
purified through a reverse-phase HPLC eluted using a VYDAC Protein and
Peptide C18 column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid.

Labeling of ERA with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 in vitro and in vivo. For
For in vitro labeling of ERa protein with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2, purified
ERa protein (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7),
45 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/L DTT, and 0.14% glycerol
was incubated for 1 h at room temperature together with DMSO or
biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 in the presence or absence of excessive amount of
15d-PGJ2 or CAY10410, or DTT. Incorporation of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2
was assessed by Western blot with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
streptavidin (Pierce) and ECL (Pierce). ERa protein was detected in the
reactions by Western blot using anti-ERa antibody. For in vivo
incorporation of 15d-PGJ2 into ERa in intact cells, MCF-7 cells were
incubated with 10 Amol/L of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 for 2 h in PRF DMEM
with 0.5% CS-FBS. Cells were lysed, and biotinylated proteins were
purified by adsorption onto Neutravidin beads (Pierce). ERa and ERh
proteins were detected in the eluates by Western blot using anti-ERa and
anti-ERh antibodies.
Preparation of ERA peptides for mass spectrometric analysis.
Purified ERa protein was incubated with DMSO or 15d-PGJ2 (10 Amol/L)
for 1 h at room temperature, lyophilized, and reconstituted in Laemmli gel
loading buffer. The samples were resolved on a NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel
(Invitrogen) and visualized by staining with SimplyBlue (Invitrogen). The
protein bands were excised, destained, reduced, and alkylated before
digestion with trypsin overnight at 37jC. Peptides were extracted and
desalted using PepClean C-18 spin columns (Pierce) and resuspended in
0.1% TFA before mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.
Nanoflow reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem MS. Nanoflow reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(RPLC-MS/MS) was done using an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) coupled online with an linear ion-trap MS (LITMS; LTQ, ThermoElectron, San Jose, CA). Nanoflow RPLC columns were
slurry-packed in-house with 5 Am, 300 Å pore size C-18 phase (Jupiter) in a
75 Am inner diameter  10 cm fused silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies,
Phoenix, AZ) with a flame pulled tip. After sample injection, the column was
washed for 20 min with 98% mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid/water) at
0.5 AL/min, and peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 2% to 42%
mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile) in 40 min at 0.25 AL/min, then
to 98% mobile phase B in 10 min. The LIT-MS was operated in a datadependent mode in which each full MS scan was followed by five MS/MS
scans, where the five most abundant molecular ions were dynamically
selected for collision-induced dissociation using normalized collision energy
of 35%. Tandem mass spectra were searched using SEQUESTagainst a human
proteome database and a mass difference of 57.0 Da (alkylation) or 316.4 Da
(15d-PGJ2 modification) was set as dynamic modification on cysteine
residues in the search.
Zinc finger assay. Zinc finger assay was done as described (29). Timedependent in vitro release of zinc from purified ERa protein treated with
15d-PGJ2 or DMSO was measured using zinc-selective fluorescent probe
N-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-p-toluenesulfonamide (TSQ, Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR).
Gel mobility shift assay. The following end-labeled [32P]oligonucleotide probes were used: ERE consensus sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5¶-GGATCTAGGTCACTGTGACCCCGGATC-3¶. ERa protein was
prepared by in vitro translation using a coupled transcription and
translation system (TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega,
Madison, WI). ERa protein (3 AL) or unprogrammed lysates were mixed
with 10,000 cpm of labeled ERE probes in 20 AL of each reaction. After a
15-min incubation at room temperature, DNA protein complexes were
analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5  Tris-borate EDTA (90 mmol/L
Tris, 90 mmol/L boric acid, 2 mmol/L EDTA). Gels were dried and
analyzed by autoradiography.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done as described previously (34). Briefly, MCF-7 cells
were treated with 15d-PGJ2 or DMSO in the presence of E2. Cells were
fixed with 1% formaldehyde and harvested. Soluble chromatin was
immunoprecipitated with ERa or ERh antibodies. The final DNA extractions
were amplified by 30 cycles of PCR using primers from 519 to 220 bp
region of the pS2 gene promoter. The primers used for PCR are as follows:

ERa or ERh to pS2 promoter, densitometric analysis was done using
ImageQuant software (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Band density was
normalized to 10% input and presented as fold change relative to basal ERa
or ERh binding to pS2 promoter in the absence of E2.
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. MCF-7 cells
were treated with 15d-PGJ2 or DMSO in the presence or absence of E2 for 2 h.
Cells were harvested for total RNA isolation using the TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 Ag of total RNA using
an oligo(dT) primers and reverse transcriptase. The resulting first-strand
cDNA was then amplified to measure mRNA levels of pS2, c-Myc, and h-actin
by 30, 30, and 25 cycles of PCR, respectively, using specific primers. The
primer sequences used for PCR to detect pS2 and c-Myc mRNA are as
follows: pS2 forward, 5¶-ATGGCCACCATGGAGAACAAG-3¶ and pS2 reverse,

to h-actin signals and presented as fold change relative to basal mRNA levels
of pS2 or c-Myc.

Results
15d-PGJ2 inhibits both E2-dependent and E2-independent
ERA transcriptional activity. 15d-PGJ2 has been shown to
inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells,

and f70% of breast cancer patients are positive for ERa (30, 31).
To investigate the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on the ERa transcriptional
activity, MCF-7 (ERa+, ERh+) and MDA-MB-231 (ERa , ERh+)
cells were transiently transfected with ERE-driven luciferase
construct. As shown in Fig. 1A, 15d-PGJ2 dramatically reduced
E2-induced ERE luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner
only in ERa-positive MCF-7 cells. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2 had little
effect on ERh-mediated transactivation in MDA-MB-231 cells
transfected with ERh expression vector (Fig. 1B), suggesting that
ERa but not ERh is a specific target for inhibition by 15d-PGJ2.
Notably, 15d-PGJ2 strongly decreased basal luciferase activity of
ERE in MCF-7 even in the absence of E2. This observation raised
the possibility that ligand-independent transactivity of ERa could
also be repressed by 15d-PGJ2. To address this hypothesis, we
examined the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on IGF-1–induced transactivation
of ERa. As previously reported (35), IGF-1 increased ERE reporter
activity possibly through activation of the AF-1 domain of ERa,
and 15d-PGJ2 visibly inhibited IGF-1–induced ERa transactivity
(Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits E2dependent and E2-independent ERa transactivity.
Based on the inhibition of ERa transactivity by 15d-PGJ2, to
investigate the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on ERa-mediated proliferation of
breast cancer cells, [3H]thymidine incorporation assay was done in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells were treated in the absence or
presence of E2 with 15d-PGJ2 or 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ2 (CAY10410),

C, effect of 15d-PGJ2 on IGF-1–dependent ERa transactivity in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 (A and C) and MDA-MB-231 (B) cells were transiently transfected with

DNA synthesis using [3H]thymidine incorporation.

Figure 2. Inhibition of ERa transcriptional
activity by 15d-PGJ2 through PPARgindependent mechanism. A, transactivity
of ERa is inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 but not by
the synthetic PPARg ligand CAY10410.
B, PPARg-dependent transactivation is
stimulated by both 15d-PGJ2 and
CAY10410. C, GW9662, a selective
PPARg antagonist, does not reverse
15d-PGJ2–induced repression of ERa
transcriptional activity, whereas it strongly
reverses the 15d-PGJ2–induced activation
of PPARg-dependent transactivation (D ).
MCF-7 cells were transfected with
ERE-tk-Luc (A and C ) and PPRE-tk-Luc
together with expression vector for PPARg
(B and D ). After 24 h, cells were treated
for 5 h with 10 Amol/L 15d-PGJ2 or
CAY10410 and indicated concentration
of GW9662 together with or without E2
(100 nmol/L) as indicated.

a natural or a synthetic agonist of PPARg, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 1D, E2 significantly stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation
in MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. 15d-PGJ2 at low
concentration (0.5–2.5 Amol/L) drastically decreased the proliferation of MCF-7 cells but not that of MDA-MB-231 cells. This
inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 was much stronger in the presence of
E2 possibly due to repression of ERa-mediated signaling pathway.
Furthermore, 15d-PGJ2 at higher concentration (5 Amol/L) greatly
blocked proliferation of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells,
irrespective of the presence of E2 possibly due to induction of
apoptosis, suggesting ERa-independent mechanism. In contrast,
CAY10410 had little effect on proliferation of either cells even at the
higher concentration (10 Amol/L), suggesting that PPARg activation may not be required for the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2.
Taken together, these results show that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits E2dependent and E2-independent ERa transactivity and subsequent
ERa-mediated proliferation of breast cancer cells.
15d-PGJ2 inhibits ERA transcriptional activity through
PPAR;-independent mechanism. To further assess the requirement of PPARg for ERa inhibition by 15d-PGJ2, MCF-7 cells were
treated with CAY10410 and GW9662, a synthetic agonist and an
antagonist for PPARg, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, CAY10410
did not have any effect on ERa transactivity, whereas it had similar
potency comparable to that of 15d-PGJ2, to activate PPRE luciferase
reporter that contains PPARg response elements (Fig. 2B).
Moreover, GW9662, a selective PPARg antagonist did not reverse
the repression of ERa by 15d-PGJ2, whereas it completely blocked
15d-PGJ2–induced PPRE-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 2C and D).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

A similar result was obtained in PPARg-negative HeLa cells (9, 36)
transiently transfected with ERa expression vector and ERE
luciferase reporter (data not shown). These results reveal that
15d-PGJ2 inhibits ERa transactivity through PPARg-independent
mechanism.
Direct modification of ERA protein by 15d-PGJ2. It has been
shown that 15d-PGJ2 covalently modifies cysteines in several
cellular proteins and alter their function (12–15, 36, 37). The
cyclopentenone moiety of 15d-PGJ2 has the capacity to directly
react with sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues of the proteins by
Michael’s addition. The only structural difference of CAY10410
from 15d-PGJ2 is its lack of cyclopentenone moiety (Fig. 3A). To
examine whether 15d-PGJ2 can directly modify ERa protein via its
cyclopentenone moiety independently of PPARg, we synthesized
biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 and examined its direct interaction with
purified ERa protein. As shown in Fig. 3B, biotinylated 15d-PGJ2
directly incorporated into ERa protein under the in vitro condition.
This incorporation was completely blocked by excessive amount of
unlabeled 15d-PGJ2 but not CAY10410 (Fig. 3C), showing the
specificity and the involvement of cyclopentenone moiety of 15dPGJ2 in the modification of ERa. In addition, this ERa modification
by biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 was significantly diminished in the
presence of 10 mmol/L DTT, suggesting the involvement of
modification of thiol groups in cysteine residues of ERa (Fig. 3C).
To explore the in vivo modification, MCF-7 cells were treated
with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 or DMSO, and whole-cell lysates were
probed with streptavidin. An estimated ERa band was identifiable
among several target proteins only in the cell lysates treated with

15d-PGJ2 but not DMSO (Supplementary Fig. S1). To further verify
in vivo modification of ERa by 15d-PGJ2, cell lysates were subjected
to pull-down assay using Neutravidin beads and followed by
Western blot with anti-ERa or anti-ERh antibody. As shown in
Fig. 3D, incorporation of biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 into ERa in vivo
was detected in the cells lysates treated with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2
but not DMSO, whereas ERh was not detected in either cell lysates,
suggesting specific modification of ERa by 15d-PGJ2. These results
suggest that 15d-PGJ2 may directly modify cysteines of ERa both
in vitro and in vivo via its cyclopentenone moiety.
Identification of Cys277 and Cys240 within the COOHterminal zinc finger of ERA DBD as targets for covalent

treated with 15d-PGJ2 or DMSO followed by digestion with trypsin
and analyzed by Nanoflow RPLC-MS/MS. The peptide sequences
were identified by searching the tandem mass spectra against a

detected in either the control or the 15d-PGJ2–treated sample; thus,
the possibility of modification of Cys381 cannot be excluded. As
shown in Fig. 4A and B, two peptides containing cysteines modified
by 15d-PGJ2 were detected. The tandem mass spectrum of a triply
charged precursor ion at m/z 877.2 of the ERa peptide
SIQGHNDYMC221PATNQC227TIDK is shown in Fig. 4A. The singly
(b2-b14) and doubly (b14, b14-NH3, and b15-NH3) charged NH2terminal product ions and the singly charged COOH-terminal
fragment ion (y2) were observed. The singly (*y6 and *y10) and
doubly (*y+2
6 ) charged COOH-terminal fragment ions were observed
to increase 316.4 Da. These observations reveal that the 15d-PGJ2
covalently modifies Cys227 but not Cys221. Figure 4B shows the
tandem mass spectrum of the doubly charged ion at m/z 521.0 of
15d-PGJ2–modified peptide SC237QAC240R. The singly charged NH2terminal fragments (b2-b5) and COOH-terminal fragment (y1) were
observed. In addition, the singly charged NH2-terminal fragment
(*b5) and the singly (*y2-*y5) and doubly (*y+2
5 ) charged COOHterminal fragments were observed to increase 316.4 Da, suggesting
that Cys240 but not Cys237 is the target for 15d-PGJ2 modification.
Consistent with the previous studies (27–29), these results show
that 15d-PGJ2 modifies two cysteines (Cys227 and Cys240) located in
the COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERa DBD that is structurally
disordered and susceptible to electrophilic attack (Fig. 4C).
Based on the observation that 15d-PGJ2 modifies two cysteines
in the COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERa DBD, the effect of 15dPGJ2 on the zinc finger function of ERa was investigated by
performing in vitro zinc finger assay. As shown in Fig. 4D, zinc was
released from recombinant ERa protein treated with 15d-PGJ2 but
not with DMSO control in a time-dependent manner, showing that
15d-PGJ2 disrupts the zinc finger of ERa DBD. Taken together,
these results suggest that 15d-PGJ2 covalently modifies two
cysteines in the COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERa DBD, resulting
in disruption of zinc finger function of ERa.
Inhibition of DNA binding of ERA by 15d-PGJ2. The COOHterminal zinc finger of ERa is structurally disordered and labile;
thus, cysteine thiols in this zinc finger are more susceptible to
electrophilic attack, resulting in loss of ERa dimerization and DNA
binding function (27–29). In good agreement with these reports,
our results showed 15d-PGJ2 disrupts ERa zinc finger function by
covalent modification of cysteines in the vulnerable COOHterminal zinc finger of ERa DBD. Based on these observations,
the possibility that 15d-PGJ2 can alter the DNA binding function
of ERa was investigated by gel mobility shift assay. As shown in
Fig. 5A, in vitro translated ERa protein bound to 32P-labeled ERE
probes, as shown by ERa-specific antibody supershift. The
formation of ERa-ERE complex was exclusively blocked by 15dPGJ2 but not by CAY10410 (Fig. 5B). This result shows that 15dPGJ2 directly inhibits DNA binding of ERa through covalent
modification of cysteines in the zinc finger of ERa DBD and
disruption of zinc finger function of ERa.
To further confirm the inhibition of DNA binding of ERa by 15dPGJ2 in vivo, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was carried out
using ERa or ERh antibody after treatment of 15d-PGJ2 in MCF-7
cells. As shown in Fig. 5C, densitometric analysis revealed that E2
enhanced up to 7-fold ERa binding to the pS2 gene promoter that
contains an ER-binding site, whereas E2 had little effect on ERh
binding to the promoter. Consistent with the result from gel

Figure 4. Cys227 and Cys240 within the COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERa DBD are identified as targets for covalent modification by 15d-PGJ2. A and B, tandem

mobility shift assay, E2-enhanced binding of ERa to the pS2
promoter was completely abrogated by 15d-PGJ2 but not by
CAY10410. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2 had little effect on ERh binding to
pS2 promoter, supported by the results from transient transfection
assay (Fig. 1B) and in vivo labeling of ER proteins by biotin-15dPGJ2 (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the results from chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay, 15d-PGJ2 notably reduced both basal
and E2-enhanced mRNA levels of pS2 and c-Myc, which are wellcharacterized ERa target genes (38), as verified by semiquantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 5D). This finding indicates that 15dPGJ2 represses the transcription of ERa target genes pS2 and c-Myc
by inhibition of ERa binding to target gene promoters. Taken
together, these results suggest that 15d-PGJ2 suppresses ERamediated transcription by inhibition of ERa DNA binding function.

Discussion
PPARg agonists, including 15d-PGJ2, have been shown to inhibit
proliferation of breast cancer cells (4, 5, 9, 10, 39). Our result shows
that 15d-PGJ2 at low concentration (0.5–2.5 Amol/L) strongly

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

decreases proliferation of ERa-positive MCF-7 cells in the absence
or presence of E2 but not that of ERa-negative MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 1D). This observation proposes that inhibitory effect of 15dPGJ2 on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells can be in part due to the
repression of ERa-mediated signaling pathway. In addition, 15dPGJ2 potently suppresses the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells as
well as MCF-7 cells at high concentration (z5 Amol/L).
Constitutive activation of NF-nB and AP-1 has been linked to the
development of hormone-independent, ERa-negative human
breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 cells (29, 40). Therefore,
it is assumed that 15d-PGJ2 at high concentration can inhibit cell
proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells possibly by affecting multiple
signaling pathways, including NF-nB and AP-1, as well as unknown
targets, independently of ERa.
Previous study has shown that 15d-PGJ2 and a synthetic PPARg
ligand (ciglitazone) induce proteasome-dependent degradation of
cyclin D1 and ERa, in a PPARg-dependent manner, resulting in
PPARg-mediated growth arrest in breast cancer cells (39). We also
observed that ERa protein was ubiquitinated after treatment of
15d-PGJ2 (Supplementary Fig. S2) as previously reported (39).

15d-PGJ2 Inhibits ERa via Covalent Modification

However, our results also showed that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits ERa
transactivity through blocking of ERa DNA binding via direct
modification of ERa, independently of PPARg. Therefore, these
findings suggest that 15d-PGJ2–adducted ERa, which is not able to
bind to and transactivate the target gene promoters, should be a
target for proteasome-dependent degradation through PPARgdependent mechanism.
Growth factors, including IGF-1, have been shown to stimulate
proliferation of breast cancer cells through crosstalk with ERa
(20–24). Phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain of ERa by mitogenactivated protein kinase or AKT, which are downstream signaling
molecules activated by growth factors, plays important roles in
E2-independent ERa transactivation and growth of ERa-positive
breast cancer cells. The activated AF-1 domain of ERa can recruit
coactivators, such as amplified in breast cancer 1 or SRC-1, even in
the presence of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen. This is considered
as one of the mechanisms of resistance to antiestrogen therapy. In
addition to antiestrogen, therapy using aromatase inhibitors aims
also to obstruct ERa transactivity by deprivation of ER ligand E2.

Figure 5. 15d-PGJ2 directly inhibits the DNA-binding activity of ERa. A and B,
gel mobility shift assay. DNA binding of ERa is inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 but not
by CAY10410 (B ). 32P-labeled ERE probes were incubated with in vitro
translated ERa (3 AL) protein or unprogrammed lysates. Anti-ERa antibody was
used for supershift (SS). NS, nonspecific. C, chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay. MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 Amol/L 15d-PGJ2 or CAY10410 in the
presence of E2 (100 nmol/L) for 2 h. Soluble chromatin from these cells was
prepared and immunoprecipitated with an ERa- or ERh-specific antibody.
The PCR fragment from 519 to 220 bp (300 bp) on the pS2 gene promoter
contains an ERE, and 10% of the soluble chromatin used in the reaction was
used as inputs. D, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. mRNA
expression levels of ERa target genes pS2 and c-Myc were reduced by
15d-PGJ2. MCF-7 cells were incubated with 15d-PGJ2 (10 Amol/L) in the
presence or absence of E2 (100 nmol/L) for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated from
cells and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. C and D, bottom, graphic
presentation of densitometric analyses of chromatin immunoprecipitation and

However, these therapeutic approaches have limitation due to the
fact that ERa still binds to its target gene promoters and mediates
growth-promoting signaling by growth factors or partial estrogenic
antiestrogens. Our results showed that 15d-PGJ2 represses both
basal and IGF-1–induced ERa transcriptional activity as well as
E2-dependent ERa activation (Fig. 1A and C). In addition, 15d-PGJ2
directly blocks the DNA binding of ERa to ERE in vitro and to its
binding sites on the target gene promoters in vivo (Fig. 5) through
disruption of zinc finger function of ERa DBD (Fig. 4). Thus, our
findings suggest that 15d-PGJ2 can block the ERa-mediated
transcription induced by growth factors and antiestrogens as well
as E2, resulting in growth inhibition of ERa-positive breast cancer
cells. This is very important because DNA binding inhibition of
ERa can be a more fundamental approach to block the ERa
transcriptional activity than antagonism or deprivation of E2.
Because the physiologic concentration of 15d-PGJ2 is in the
picomolar to nanomolar range (41, 42), the micromolar concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 typically used in our and other studies may not
be physiologically relevant. However, our study provides a new
approach for development of drugs derived from 15d-PGJ2 that
contains the reactive cyclopentenone moiety to treat ERa-positive
breast cancers.
The ERa DBD contains two functionally and structurally
nonequivalent Cys4 zinc finger motifs that are crucial to ERamediated transcription. The COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERa
DBD is structurally disordered and susceptible to electrophilic
attack as a monomer but is stabilized by dimerization (27–29). Our
previous study showed that electrophilic agents, such as 2,2¶dithiobisbenzamide-1 and benzisothiazolone, preferentially disrupt
the vulnerable COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERa DBD, resulting in
inhibition of dimerization and DNA binding of ERa (29). In the
present study, we identified Cys227 and Cys240 within the COOHterminal zinc finger of ERa DBD as targets for covalent
modification by 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 4). In addition, our zinc ejection
experiment showed that 15d-PGJ2 disrupts zinc finger function
of ERa (Fig. 4), resulting in inhibition of ERa DNA binding and
thus suppression of target gene transcription, such as the protooncogene c-Myc (Fig. 5). Therefore, the growth-inhibitory effect
of 15d-PGJ2 on ERa-positive breast cancers can be mediated
by direct modification and disruption of zinc finger function of
ERa DBD.
In summary, we have identified 15d-PGJ2 as a potent inhibitor of
ERa transactivity through direct covalent modification of ERa,
independently of PPARg. 15d-PGJ2 directly adducts with Cys227 and
Cys240 within the COOH-terminal zinc finger of ERa DBD, resulting
in inhibition of both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent ERa-mediated transcription and growth in breast cancer cells.
Therefore, our finding presents a novel approach to the design of
new drugs to treat ERa-positive breast cancers based on covalent
modification of cysteines within the vulnerable COOH-terminal
zinc finger of ERa DBD and subsequent DNA binding inhibition of
ERa rather than conventional antagonism of estrogen.
