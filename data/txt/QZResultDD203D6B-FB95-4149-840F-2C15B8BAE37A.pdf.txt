Abstract
Bcl2 and IAP families are anti-apoptotic proteins deregulated in multiple
myeloma (MM) cells. Pharmacological inhibition of each of these families has shown
significant activity only in subgroups of MM patients. Here, we have examined a
broad-spectrum Bcl2 family inhibitor Obatoclax (OBX) in combination with a Smac
mimetic LCL161 in MM cell lines and patient cells. LCL161/OBX combination induced
synergistic cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative effects on a broad range of human MM
cell lines. The cytotoxicity was mediated through inhibition of the IAPs, activation of
caspases and up regulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bid, Bim, Puma and Noxa
by the drug combination. In addition, we observed that OBX caused ER stress and
activated the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) leading to drug resistance. LCL161,
however inhibited spliced Xbp-1, a pro-survival factor. In addition, we observed
that OBX increased GRP78 localization to the cell surface, which then induced PI3K
dependent Akt activation and resistance to cell death. LCL161 was able to block OBX
induced Akt activation contributing to synergistic cell death. Our results support
clinical evaluation of this combination strategy in relapsed refractory MM patients.

Introduction

presence of one or more Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains
[3, 4]. The ratio of the pro and anti-apoptotic proteins
and the complex interactions between them determines
whether an individual cell survives or undergoes apoptosis
[3, 4]. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members include
Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl, Bcl-w and Mcl-1, all of which contain multi
BH domains (BH1-4). The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members can be further grouped into sensitizer, activator,
and effector proteins. The sensitizer and activator proteins
are both single BH domain (BH3) -containing proteins
that modulate the activity of the effector proteins through
different mechanisms. The sensitizer proteins include Bad,
Bik, Bmf, Puma and Noxa and the activator proteins are
Bid and Bim. The effector proteins Bak and Bax, which

Novel therapies have greatly improved the
prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) patients [1]. Yet,
patients continue to relapse and become refractory to
existing therapies. Hence, there is an urgent need for
newer therapies based on a better understanding of the
disease biology. Apoptotic pathways are deregulated in
hematological malignancies including MM and contributes
towards resistance observed, to existing therapies [2],
Inhibiting these anti-apoptotic pathways therefore holds
considerable promise to overcoming resistance in MM.
The Bcl-2 family of proteins includes multiple pro
and anti-apoptotic members that are characterized by the

LCL161 modulated the ER stress response by reducing
levels of spliced Xbp1, a survival factor implicated in
MM. LCL161 also reduced OBX induced pAkt thereby
contributing to enhanced apoptosis.

are both multi BH domain-containing proteins, specifically
cause mitochondrial membrane permeabilization thereby
releasing pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol [3, 4].
In MM, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
have been shown to be up regulated and important for
MM cell survival and resistance to existing therapies [58]. Molecules targeting the interaction between pro and
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have shown significant preclinical activity [9-12]. Recently, it has been shown that
molecules inhibiting Bcl-2, but not Mcl-1, show promising
anti-MM activity only in MM cell lines and patients with
t(11;14) translocation, the same group that expresses
high levels of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl [13, 14]. Obatoclax
(OBX), a molecule inhibiting Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl
has shown potent activity against cytogenetically distinct
MM cell lines and patient cells alone or in combination
with other agents [9, 15]. However, limited activity was
seen after OBX treatment in a clinical trial involving MM
patients [16].
Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) represent
another important family of anti-apoptotic proteins,
comprising of eight family members, and is potentially a
therapeutic target in MM [17]. IAPs inhibit apoptosis by
blocking activation of caspases [18, 19]. The three most
well studied IAP proteins are cellular IAP 1 (cIAP1),
cellular IAP 2 (cIAP2) and X-linked IAP (XIAP). Of these
three, XIAP binds directly to caspases 9 and 3 and blocks
their activation [20]. cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, on the other
hand, indirectly regulate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
through ubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein
(RIP) [21, 22]. During conditions that signal cells to
commit suicide, Second Mitochondria-derived Activator
of caspases (Smac) is released from the mitochondria.
Once in the cytosol, Smac binds to IAPs at Smac binding
sites thereby preventing their activity [23, 24]. However,
many cancers including MM express aberrantly high
levels of IAPs, thus successfully blocking apoptosis
in tumors [17, 25-27]. We recently showed that IAP
inhibition by using the Smac mimetic LCL161 induced
potent apoptosis in a subset of MM cell lines and patient
cells [17]. In that study, we observed that the Bcl-2 family
of anti-apoptotic proteins was not down regulated post
LCL161 treatment [17]. It has also been shown that Bcl2 expression confers resistance to LCL161 treatment in
hepatocellular carcinoma [28]. We therefore hypothesized
that combining a Smac mimetic such as LCL161 with a
pan Bcl-2 family inhibitor such as OBX would overcome
the apoptotic resistance of MM cells and trigger them to
undergo programmed cell suicide.
In this study, we observed that LCL161 in
combination with OBX led to increased apoptotic activity,
inducing cell death synergistically and greatly reducing
proliferation. Upon further examination of the mechanism
of action of the drug combination, we observed activation
of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by
OBX. OBX caused ER stress led to cell survival signals

Results
LCL161 and OBX synergistically promote
cytotoxicity, inhibit proliferation, and overcome
protective shield of the microenvironment in MM
First, we tested if LCL161/OBX combination
induced synergistic cytotoxicity in MM cells. For
this, MM cell lines were incubated with varying
concentrations of both single agent and combination
of drugs for 72 hours. Out of 9 lines tested, 6 showed a
synergistic relationship (CI < 1) between the LCL161
and OBX, reaching IC-50 levels at notably lower doses
of the individual drugs compared with that used in
combination. The concentrations and the cytotoxicity
at the combination with maximum synergy (lowest CI
value) are shown (Figure 1A). Proliferation assays after
incubation with both agents yielded similar results, with
the anti-proliferative effect of the combination treatment
being notably higher in comparison to single agent effects
(Figure 1B).
Next, we examined if the synergistic anti-tumor
effects elicited by LCL161/OBX was also observed
when MM cells were co-cultured with components of
the microenvironment. For this, we co-cultured MM cell
lines with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from
MM patients and then treated with LCL161, OBX or the
combination. We observed that the combination treatment
was able to overcome the protective effects of the tumorpromoting microenvironment more effectively than either
of the agents individually (Figures 1C).

LCL161 and OBX promote apoptotic cell death
We then examined if LCL161/OBX caused cell
death through the induction of apoptosis. For this and
for our further studies, we used two MM cell lines, one
sensitive (MM1.R) and the other relatively resistant to
LCL161 (MM1.S) [17]. These are isogenic cell lines
derived from a parental cell line (MM1), with one
being sensitive (MM1.S) and the other being resistant
to dexamethasone (MM1.R) [29]. We used these
genetically similar cell lines in our studies with the hope
of identifying factors that could predict for sensitivity to
LCL161 in addition to examining the mechanism of action
of LCL161/OBX combination. MM1.R and MM1.S were
incubated with LCL161, OBX or the combination and
apoptosis was examined using the Annexin-PI assay. Our

results indicated that while the drugs induced apoptosis
as single agents, the combination clearly induced more
pronounced apoptosis in both the cell lines (Figures 2A
and 2B). Furthermore, western blots revealed increased
activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3 and PARP cleavage
post LCL161 or the combination treatment indicating
activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic
pathways by LCL161 or the combination (Figures 2C
and 2D). From Figures 2C and 2D, it is clear that OBX at
the doses used is unable to induce activation of caspases.
To further confirm the role of caspases in the apoptosis
induced by the drugs, we incubated MM1.S with LCL161,
OBX or the combination along with caspase inhibitors. We
observed that the ability of LCL161 to induce cell death
was completely blocked by pan-caspase inhibitor (Figure
2E). The activity of OBX was not significantly influenced
by any of the caspase inhibitors. This suggests that caspase
activation is not essential for OBX induced cell death at
the doses used in this study. Synergy between the drugs
was not observed when cells were treated with caspase 8

or pan caspase inhibitors. Thus, the ability of LCL161 to
induce caspase 8 dependent extrinsic apoptosis appears to
be essential for the observed synergy between the drugs.
Trudel et al [9] showed that OBX induces caspase
activation in MM cells albeit at doses much higher than
the ones used here in our study. Thus, caspase activation
appears to be triggered by OBX at higher doses and might
be required to induce more pronounced and complete cell
death. However, here we were able to induce pronounced
cell death by using OBX at lower doses in combination
with LCL161. LCL161 through direct IAP inhibition
or through other mechanisms is able to overcome such
resistance mechanisms to OBX and induce synergistic
cell death.
Next, we examined the effects of LCL161/OBX
combination on primary plasma cells from 8 MM patients
and observed that the drug combination induced more
potent apoptosis than either of the single agents (Figures
2F and 2G).

of BMSCs and inhibit proliferation to the extent observed when the MM cells were cultured alone in the absence of BMSCs.

LCL161 and OBX effectively inhibit IAPs and upregulate pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins

and Puma were up regulated by OBX, while Bid was up
regulated by LCL161 (Figures 3C and 3D). In addition, we
also saw Noxa up regulation by both LCL161 and OBX in
both MM1.R and MM1.S cells and Bik up regulation by
OBX in MM1.R cells (Figures 3C and 3D). Importantly,
all these effects were retained when the cells were treated
with the combination.

From the results depicted in Figures 2A-2D, it
became clear that the LCL161/OBX combination induces
apoptosis. We wanted to understand the mechanism
through which apoptosis was induced by the drug
combination. LCL161 induced down regulation of cIAP1
and XIAP in both MM1.R and MM1.S cells. LCL161 was
unable to cause a significant down regulation of cIAP2 in
MM1.S cells as reported earlier [17] (Figures 3A and 3B).
Furthermore, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bim,

OBX induces protective autophagy
From the results presented in Figures 2C, 2D and
2E, we hypothesized that the lack of caspase activation

5μM of LCL161, 200nM of OBX or the combination for 72hrs. In both A. and B. apoptosis induction was measured using Annexin/PI
staining and in both cases the drug combination induced more apoptosis than either of the individual drugs. C. MM1.R and D. MM1.S cells
were incubated with indicated concentrations of LCL161, OBX or the combination for 12 or 24 hours and caspases 9, 8 and 3 and PARP
levels were examined by western blotting. β Actin was used as a loading control. All experiments were performed thrice and the results
presented are from a representative experiment. E. We incubated MM1.S cells with indicated doses of LCL161, OBX or the combination
for 72hrs alone or in the presence of 10μM of either caspase 9 inhibitor (Ac-LEHD-CMK), caspase 8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) or pancaspase inhibitor (Q-VD-OPH) and measured the cytotoxicity induced by MTT assays. F. Primary cells from 6 MM patients were incubated
with indicated doses of LCL161, OBX or the combination for 72 hrs. Apo 2.7 staining was done to examine apoptosis induction post drug
treatment. G. Primary cells from 2 MM patients were incubated with indicated doses of LCL161, OBX or the combination for 72hrs.

and more pronounced apoptosis by OBX was due to the
fact that the cells induced resistance mechanism(s) to the
drug treatment. More importantly, this also suggested
that LCL161 was able to overcome such resistance
mechanisms and induce synergistic apoptosis.
Given that OBX could induce autophagy [30, 31],
we wanted to examine if OBX induced autophagy as a
mechanism to overcome cell death signals. For this,
we examined levels of microtubule-associated protein
1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) levels. The conversion
of LC3-I to the lipidated LC3-II form is a marker of
autophagy [32]. Examining LC3 levels clearly showed
accumulation of LC3-II after OBX treatment indicating
induction of autophagy (Figures 4A and 4B). To identify
if the autophagy induced was cytoprotective, we treated
MM1.R and MM1.S cells with OBX, autophagy inhibitor
chloroquine or OBX in combination with chloroquine.
Chloroquine treatment sensitized both cell lines to
OBX activity, suggesting that OBX induced protective
autophagy (Figures 4A and 4B). Using chloroquine in
combination with LCL161 did not show any significant

increase in cell death (data not shown). To confirm if
LC3-II accumulation was due to autophagy induction and
not due to blockage of it’s autophagic degradation [33],
we treated cells with OBX in the presence or absence of
lysosomal protease inhibitors (LPI). Our results showed
increased LC3-II accumulation in the presence of LPI
confirming induction of autophagy (Figure 4C).

LCL161 and OBX modulate different arms of
the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress induced
unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway
Given that autophagy could be induced through the
unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, we wanted to
understand if OBX modulated this pathway. In a recent
study, it was shown that OBX induced the UPR pathway,
which contributed to cell survival [34]. We therefore
examined expression levels of proteins involved in the
UPR pathway. We observed clear modulation of ER stress
mediated UPR pathway by OBX and surprisingly by

Figure 3: A. MM1.R and B. MM1.S cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of LCL161, OBX or the combination for 12

respectively. C. MM1.R and D. MM1.S cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of LCL161, OBX or the combination for 12
or 24 hours and expression levels of the Bcl2 family of pro and anti-apoptotic proteins were observed. GAPDH or β Actin was used as a
loading control respectively. All experiments were done three times. Results are from one representative experiment.

LCL161 as well. However, LCL161 and OBX targeted
different branches of the UPR pathway. OBX activated
the ATF6 and PERK/peif2α/ATF4 branches of the UPR
(Figures 4D and 4E), both of which have been implicated
in cell survival during ER stress [35, 36]. ATF4 under
irrecoverable ER stress can lead to increase in transcription
of CHOP and cause apoptosis. We therefore examined
levels of CHOP and observed no induction of CHOP post

treatment with either of the drugs or the combination (data
not shown). LCL161, however inhibited the IRE1 branch
of the UPR by down regulating Xbp-1 splicing [37], which
is a pro survival activity of IREI [37], suggesting that
LCL161 targeted ER stress to induce apoptosis (Figures
4D and 4E).

with indicated concentrations of OBX for 72hrs alone or in the presence of 20μM chloroquine and cytotoxicity was measured by MTT
assays. C. When MM1.R or MM1.S cells were treated with indicated concentrations of OBX alone, 10μg/ml of lysosomal protease
inhibitors (LPI) alone or the combination for 24hrs, we observed increased accumulation of LC3-II when cells were treated with OBX in
combination with LPI. Experiments were performed thrice and results from a representative experiment are shown. Upper panel D. and E.

OBX causes GRP78 migration to the plasma
membrane and activates Akt

the surface of malignant cells including MM cells and
activates signal transduction pathways thereby promoting
their survival [38, 39]. In another study, it was shown that
cancer cells resistant to therapy promote GRP78 migration
to the cell membrane, which was further enhanced by ER
stress [40]. Given that OBX induced ER stress and Akt
activation, we hypothesized that OBX promoted GRP78
migration to the cell membrane, which subsequently
caused Akt activation. To test this, we first examined cell
surface expression of GRP78 after treating MM cells
with OBX, LCL161 or the combination. We observed
clear increase in cell surface expression of GRP78 after
treating cells with OBX or OBX+LCL161 (Figure 5A). To
understand if increased cell surface localization of GRP78
contributed to the activation of Akt by OBX, we treated
MM cells with an antibody to GRP78 (clone C38) that has
been shown to block the Akt activation by GRP78 [41].

Next, we wanted to examine how LCL161/OBX
modulated other signaling pathways important for MM
cell survival and observed that pAkt (Ser 473) was up
regulated by OBX (Figures 4F and 4G). To our knowledge,
this is the first report showing pAkt up regulation post
OBX treatment. Surprisingly, we found that OBX down
regulated activated levels of S6, a protein downstream of
mTOR (Figures 4F and 4G). It was interesting to note that
LCL161 when used in combination with OBX was able to
prevent both the increase in pAkt and the decrease in pS6
induced by OBX (Figures 4F and 4G).
We then wanted to understand how OBX induced
pAkt. GRP78, an ER chaperone protein is expressed on

Figure 5: A. MM1.R was left untreated or treated with 150nM OBX, 2μM LCL161 or the combination for 12hrs and cell surface

expression of GRP78 was examined using flow cytometry. Y-axis represents mean GRP78 expression channel number. OBX has high auto
fluorescence and hence results are presented as mean GRP78 expression channel number, which is the difference between mean channel
number with GRP78 antibody and the mean channel number without GRP78 antibody for each treatment condition. Experiments were
performed two times and error bars represent one standard deviation. B. MM1.R cells were treated with indicated concentrations of OBX,
anti-GRP78 antibody (polyclonal antibody) or the combination and pAkt (S473), pAkt (T308) and PARP levels were examined by western
blotting. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Experiments were performed two times and results from a representative experiment are
shown. C. MM1.R cells were treated with indicated concentrations of OBX, anti GRP78 antibody (Clone C38) or the combination for 72hrs
following which viability was measured by a MTT assay. OBX+GRP78 induced significantly more cell death than either of the agents
alone (p < 0.05). The results presented are the mean of 5 independent experiments. D. MM1.R, MM1.S, H929 and OPM2 cells were treated
with various concentrations of OBX for 72hrs, various concentrations of Akti for 48hrs or the drugs in combination. MTT assays were
performed. Synergy was seen across multiple concentrations. The concentrations at which maximum synergy was observed is shown in the
figure. Experiments were performed three times.

Our results clearly show down regulation of both pAkt
(T308) and pAkt (S473) by the anti-GRP78 antibody.
More importantly, our results also showed the ability of
the antibody to reduce OBX induced pAkt levels when
used in combination with OBX (Figure 5B). Next, we
wanted to examine if the pAkt up regulation contributed
to resistance to OBX treatment. For this, we treated cells
with OBX, anti-GRP78 (clone C38) or the combination
and observed significantly more cell death when the cells
were treated with the antibody drug combination (Figure
5C). Using the antibody in combination with LCL161 did
not show enhanced cell death (data not shown) further
suggesting that GRP78 mediated pAkt up regulation
was a specific resistance factor to OBX. Furthermore,
synergistic cell death was also observed when OBX was
used in combination with an Akt inhibitor (Figure 5D) or a
PI3K inhibitor (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest
that OBX caused GRP78 localization to the cell surface,

which then led to activation of pAkt in a PI3K dependent
mechanism. We then checked to see if GRP78 associated
directly with PI3K and observed no detectable association
between the proteins (data not shown).

Discussion
During early stages, MM plasma cells are relatively
more proliferative and dependent on the microenvironment
both of which decrease with disease progression. Plasma
cells in advanced myeloma patients are typically geared
towards long-term survival and low apoptotic rates.
Alterations in the anti/pro-apoptotic protein ratio are an
important contributing factor for the low apoptotic rates
as well as for resistance observed to existing therapies.
Inhibiting these anti apoptotic pathways is therefore
of clinical relevance in MM. Two important apoptotic
pathways that are de regulated in MM are the ones

Figure 6: A model depicting the mechanism of action of LCL161/OBX in MM cells. LCL161 binds and inhibits the functions

of IAPs causing activation of caspases and apoptosis induction. OBX modulates the binding of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins with
the anti- apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins and causes the activation of BH3 only proteins, which eventually leads to apoptosis induction. In
addition, both OBX and LCL161 modulate ER stress and the subsequent activation of specific branches of the UPR pathway. OBX activates
the PERK/peif2α/ATF4 and ATF6 branches of the UPR pathway. One or both of these possibly contribute to pmTOR inhibition, which
leads to protective autophagy. OBX also causes cell surface localization of GRP78, which then activates Akt through a PI3K dependent
mechanism. LCL161, on the other hand, causes reduction in Xbp1 splicing. In addition, LCL161 blocks OBX induced pAkt, which then
sensitizes cells to OBX treatment. We also observed that pS6 (a protein downstream of mTOR) down regulation by OBX was largely
prevented by LCL161. Thus, LCL161/OBX combination induces synergistic apoptosis in MM cells through numerous mechanisms.

ablation of the IAPs led to increased sensitivity to these
agents [46]. In our study, we show that OBX promoted
cell surface localization of GRP78, which then led to
activation of Akt through PI3K dependent pathways.
To confirm that GRP78 induced pAkt up regulation
contributed to resistance to OBX, we used an antibody to
GRP78 or an Akt1/2 inhibitor (Akti) in combination with
OBX. Both combinations promoted cell killing by OBX
suggesting that this was indeed a resistance mechanism
to OBX. Interestingly, LCL161 was able to reduce both
baseline as well as OBX induced pAkt though it did not
reduce cell surface localization of GRP78. In addition,
we also observed down regulation of pS6 suggesting
mTORC1 inhibition after OBX treatment. We speculate
that mTORC1 inhibition occurs through the ATF4 or
ATF6 arms of the UPR induced by OBX. Interestingly,
LCL161 was able to largely prevent OBX mediated
pS6 down regulation. Taken together, LCL161/OBX
induced synergistic cell death is mediated through several
mechanisms as shown in Figure 6. Our study is also on
similar lines as recent studies that have shown GRP78 as
a therapeutic target in MM [39, 47, 48] and presents clear
evidence that GRP78 activates PI3K/Akt signaling in MM,
a pathway important for MM cell survival and resistance
to existing therapies. Targeting GRP78 in combination
with existing therapies might therefore show promising
activity in MM cells.

mediated by the Bcl-2 and IAP families. Inhibiting either
one of the pathways alone appears to show significant
response only in a limited set of MM cell lines and patient
cells [13, 14, 17]. Moreover, inhibiting the Bcl-2 family
using OBX showed significant neurotoxicity in a clinical
trial in MM [16]. Using OBX in combination with other
agents therefore promises to be able to reduce the toxicities
while still significantly inducing apoptosis in MM cells.
Our earlier studies using LCL161 identified up regulated
levels of pStat3 and NF-κB post drug treatment, both of
which can modulate expression levels of Bcl-2 family of
proteins [17]. Here, we simultaneously suppressed both
these protein families and observed potent synergy when
the drugs were used in combination.
In addition to OBX, which is a pan-Bcl-2 family
inhibitor, ABT-737 and ABT-199 are two other drugs
inhibiting the Bcl-2 family that have been investigated
in MM. ABT-737 is a Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl and Bcl-w inhibitor
while ABT-199 is a Bcl-2 inhibitor. We used LCL161 in
combination with either ABT-737 or ABT-199 and found
that LCL161 did not synergize with ABT-737 or ABT199 (data not shown) indicating that Mcl-1 inhibition
could be important for the observed synergy between
LCL161 and OBX. We also observed induction of Mcl1 binding partners Bim, Noxa and Puma [42] after OBX
treatment and the combination, further suggesting Mcl-1
inhibition It has been shown in a prior study that OBX was
able to inhibit Mcl-1/Bak interaction but not Bcl-2/Bak
interaction in MM cells (Trudel et al) further suggesting
that OBX induced pro-apoptotic Bim, Noxa and Puma up
regulation is mediated through Mcl-1 inhibition. However,
OBX did not cause activation of caspases, nor did it induce
caspase dependent cell death suggesting that mechanisms
independent of Mcl-1 inhibition could be involved in cell
death induced by the drug. OBX has been shown to induce
autophagy that can be either cytoprotective or cytotoxic to
cells [30, 31]. We observed that OBX induced protective
autophagy in MM cells.
Other studies have shown the UPR pathway
activation as important factors for MM cell survival,
and agents perturbing this pathway induce cell death in
myeloma [43, 44]. Moreover, it has been shown that OBX
can induce ER stress [34, 45]. Our studies showed the
activation of ER stress induced UPR pathways by both
OBX and LCL161 in MM cells. OBX induced recoverable
ER stress that led to activation of survival mechanisms
However, LCL161 was able to counteract this resistance
mechanism by inhibiting spliced Xbp1 levels and pAkt
down regulation. When we examined levels of other
important signaling pathways implicated in MM, we
observed that OBX caused an up regulation of pAkt
(Ser 473). A prior study showed that Akt is activated via
ER stress induced after treatment with thapsigargin or
tunicamycin [46]. In the same study, the authors showed
that the activated Akt led to up regulation of IAPs, which
caused resistance to ER stress induced apoptosis and

Materials and Methods
MM cell lines and patient cells
Cell lines MM1.S (Dexamethasone sensitive),
MM1.R (Dexamethasone resistant) and RPMI 8226 were
kindly provided by Dr. Jonathan Keats (TGen, Phoenix,
AZ, USA), DOX 40 (Doxorubicin resistant) was kindly
provided by Dr. William Dalton (Moffitt Cancer Center,
Tampa, FL, USA), and NC-H929 was purchased from
ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 media (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA, USA)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech Inc.),
100U/mL penicillin, 100uG/ml streptomycin, and 2mM
glutamine (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Freshly
obtained bone marrow aspirates from MM patients were
obtained after informed consent and processed to collect
either myeloma cells or bone marrow stromal cells
(BMSCs) as described earlier [49-51]. Patient cells were
cultured as MM cell lines except that 20% fetal bovine
serum was used instead of 10% fetal bovine serum.

Drugs and cytokines
LCL161 was synthesized and provided by Novartis

Western blots

(MTA). Obatoclax was purchased from Selleckchem
(Houston, TX, USA). Pancaspase inhibitor (Q-VD-OPH),
caspase 9 inhibitor (Ac-LEHD-CMK) and caspase 8
inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) were purchased from EMD
Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Akti and chloroquine
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA).

Western blots were performed as detailed elsewhere
[49-52]. All antibodies used except the ones specified
below were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA, USA). cIAP1 antibody was obtained
from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA, USA). Puma, ATF6
and XBP1 antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA) and Noxa
antibody was purchased from EMD Millipore. Stripping
buffer was purchased from EMD Millipore. Antigenantibody complexes were detected using enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ,
USA).

Cytotoxicity and proliferation assays
MM cell lines were cultured in 96-well culture
plates with either the single agent drugs or combination.
To measure cytotoxicity, a 3- [4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric
assay was employed [49-51]. For MTT experiments with
GRP78, the antibody used was purchased from EMD
Millipore (Clone C38 Cat # MABS443). To measure
proliferation, tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake was
measured [49-51]. For experiments involving co-culture
with BMSC, cell lines were cultured with or without prior
co-culture agents for 48 hours, and the aforementioned
thymidine uptake assay was employed.

GRP78 surface expression
After treatment with drugs, cells were harvested,
pelleted and washed with PBS. Subsequently, the pellet
was split into two tubes. To tube 2, 10μl of a 1:50 dilution
(PBS/3%BSA) of GRP78 antibody (Cat # pa511418 from
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added and
tube 1 was the no antibody control. Tubes were incubated
for 15-30 minutes at room temperature. 2ml of PBS was
added to each tube and they were spun for 5 minutes.
Supernatants were decanted and 100μl of a 1:250 dilution
(PBS/3% BSA) of goat anti mouse IgG (fab specificSigma F-4018) was added to each tube and incubated for
15-30 minutes at room temperature, in the dark followed
by a wash with PBS. Supernatants were decanted and
cells were resuspended in 0.5ml of 1% paraformaldehyde.
Tubes were kept in the dark until run on the BD CantoII
flow cytometer.

Apoptosis assays
Apoptotic activity in MM cell lines was measured
using Annexin-V/PI assay. Cells were cultured with either
single agent drugs or combination treatment for 48 or
72hrs. Cells were harvested and washed once in annexinbinding-buffer (ABB) comprised of 10 mM HEPES pH
7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2. Cells were incubated
with 3μL of Annexin-FITC for 15 minutes in the dark at
room temperature. The volume was brought to 2mL of
ABB, and cell suspensions were spun at 400g for 5mins.
Pellets were resuspended in 0.5mL of ABB with 5μL of
1μg/μL propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples
were run on a Canto 2 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA). Viable cells were characterized
by Annexin/PI negative staining. In addition, apoptotic
activity in MM patient derived primary plasma cells was
measured using Apo 2.7 assay as described earlier [49,
52].

Isobologram analysis
Synergy was quantified in the MTT cytotoxicity
analyses utilizing the program Calcusyn. By the ChouTalalay method, combination index values (CI values)
were calculated by the equation CI = (D1)/(Dx1)+(D2)
(Dx2) +(D1)(D2)/(Dx1)(Dx2), where D1 and D2 are the
doses of drugs 1 and 2 required to achieve x effect in
combination, and Dx1 and Dx2 are the doses of drugs 1
and 2 needed to achieve the same x effect as single agents
[53].

Nuclear Extracts
Nuclear extracts were prepared using the NEPER Nuclear extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) following manufacturer’s protocol.
Following extraction, BCA assay was used to calculate
protein concentration (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and
samples were then used for western blots as described
below.
