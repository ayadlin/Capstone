Selection for endocrine therapy requires the identification of markers that accurately predict response/resistance. In this report, the authors review their published work and abstract results from an unpublished study to illustrate the
potential of RNA microarrays from sequential tumor biopsies from patients who
were offered neoadjuvant endocrine therapy treatment to identify the molecular
signatures associated with tumor sensitivity/resistance. Clinical response was
assessed by serial ultrasound measurements in postmenopausal women with
large, primary, estrogen receptor-rich breast cancers who received neoadjuvant

hird-generation aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, have an
established role in the treatment of hormone-sensitive postmenopausal breast cancer.1–7 The drugs are specific, in that their
only primary endocrine effect is to inhibit the aromatase enzyme8
and reduce endogenously synthesized estrogen.8-10 In hormone-dependent breast cancers, estrogen deprivation may cause cell death,
reduced proliferation, and tumor regression. However, this does not
occur in all tumors, and there is a need to identify molecular markers of response so that treatment may be given selectively. In this
report, we review some published work and abstract results from an
unpublished study from our own research to define early changes in
the expression of estrogen deprivation/proliferation markers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were postmenopausal women who presented to the Edinburgh Breast Unit with large, primary, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.
All provided informed consent to be included in the
study, which had been approved by the local ethics
committee (2001/W/BU/09 and 2001/W/BU/10). A
consecutive series of 80 patients was recruited
excluding patients who had known multifocal tumors
or tumors of special histological type. Patients
received neoadjuvant treatment for 3 months with
letrozole (Femara; 2.5 mg daily). Core biopsies were
taken with a 14-gauge needle before and after 10 to
14 days of treatment. Clinical response was based on
reductions in tumor volumes, as determined from
ultrasound measurements over 3 months. Reduction
in volume >50% was taken as evidence of clinical
response.

Tissue Processing and RNA Extraction
Biopsies were snap-frozen immediately and stored in
liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were taken to confirm the presence of cancerous tissue. Only samples
in which the malignant component comprised 20%
of the section area were used in further analyses.
Biopsies were pulverized using U2 microdismembranator U (Braun Biotech). Total RNA was extracted by
using TRI-reagent (Sigma) and was purified further
on RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen). RNA quantity
and quality were verified on a Bioanalyser 2100
(Agilent).

RNA Amplification and Reverse Transcription
RNA (500 ng) was subject to 2 rounds of amplification.11 Briefly, the first round of amplification used
nonbiotinylated ribonucleotides and the Ambion
MegScript kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex). This complementary RNA (cRNA) was converted to doublestranded DNA, and biotinylated cRNA was generated
by using the Enzo kit.
Microarray Hybridization and Data Normalization
Biotinylated cRNA was fragmented and added to
Affymetrix HG_U133A chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
Calif) as described in the standard protocol outlined
in the Gene Chip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix). After hybridization, microarrays
were washed with a custom GNF chip washer and
were scanned with an Affymetrix 3000 laser scanner.

RESULTS
Derivation of Database
One of 80 tumors was a protocol violation, because
it was an ER-negative tumor on review. In 11 of the
remaining 79 tumors, 1 or both biopsies had either
<20% malignancy or failed to yield good-quality
RNA. Microarray analysis was performed on the
remaining 68 tumors (84%). Analyzable results were
obtained in paired biopsies in 58 tumors (73%). The
database from these tumors was subjected to bioinformatic analyses.
Changes in Gene Expression Associated With Therapy
Three approaches were used to characterize changes
in gene expression that occurred with therapy: 1) to
examine consistency of change by identifying genes
that were up-regulated or down-regulated in most
tumors irrespective of the magnitude of effect, 2) to
identify genes that showed the greatest magnitude of
change irrespective of the number of tumors, and 3)
significance analysis of microarrays15 to identify the
genes that changed most significantly with therapy.
The resultant gene lists have recently been published.16 These revealed changes in genes classically
associated with estrogen regulation (KIAA0101, trefoil
factor 3 [TFF3], SERPINA3, IRS1, TFF1) and cell proliferation (CDC2, Cyclin B1, CKS2, TYMS, PCNA).
Details are summarized in Table 1.

Gene Profiles and Clinical Response/Resistance
Of 58 tumors that were analyzed for genetic changes,
6 tumors were excluded because of inconsistencies
in assessment of clinical response. Seventy-one percent of the remaining tumors (37 of 52) were classified as responders (>50% reduction in tumor volume
by ultrasound), and 29% (15 of 52 tumors) were classified as nonresponders (<50% reduction in tumor
volume).

Markers of estrogen sensitivity and proliferation
Changes in the markers identified in Table 1 are illustrated in Figure 1 and are subdivided according to
clinical response. The predominant effect was a
decrease in expression, and this was observed irrespective of whether tumors were classified as clinical
responders or nonresponders. Examination of individual molecular patterns in the nonresponding group
(Fig. 2) suggested heterogeneity in the patterns of

change that occurred with treatment. Thus, it was
possible to identify a group of tumors in which 1)
both estrogen-dependent and proliferation genes
were decreased, 2) markers were changed only marginally, and 3) estrogen-dependent genes were
decreased but proliferation genes were increased.

DISCUSSION
Blockade of estrogen synthesis using aromatase inhibitors increasingly occupies a central role in the
management of postmenopausal women with ERpositive tumors. Agents like letrozole, anastrozole,
and exemestane have great potency and specificity8,17,18 and can be used to examine the molecular
effects of estrogen deprivation in breast cancers in
vivo. Although investigations have been performed
on cell lines19 there is no substantial investigation on
primary breast cancers.
Not all ER-positive tumors respond to aromatase
inhibitors, and there is a need for molecular markers
that predict for response/resistance to treatment to
optimize patient management and identify molecular
pathways associated with resistance. By combining a
neoadjuvant protocol in which tumors are sequentially biopsied before and after 14 days of treatment
and RNA microarray analysis on the paired biopsies
it is possible to: 1) identify early changes in gene
expression produced by treatment and 2) correlate
gene expression profiles with tumor response/resistance to treatment.

Gene Expression Changed With Letrozole Treatment
Among the down-regulated genes were KIAA0101, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, SERPINA3, TFF1,
and TFF3. These are classic examples of estrogenregulated genes in which it has been demonstrated
that expression is either induced by estrogen or
reduced by estrogen deprivation/antiestrogens in experimental systems.19–23 In addition, down-regulated
probes included those for the genes associated with
proliferation, for example, CDC2, cyclin B1, CKS2,
TYMS, and PCNA. Again, it has been demonstrated
that these genes are down-regulated by estrogen
deprivation in estrogen-responsive systems in
vitro.20,24–27 The observations in the current study
also are consistent with reductions in immunohistochemical staining for the proliferation marker Ki67
observed in many of the same tumors.29
Clinical Response and Resistance
Classic estrogen-regulated genes, such as TFF1, are
unlikely to be accurate predictors of response to

therapy in individual breast cancers, because they
frequently are changed with treatment in both clinically responding and nonresponding tumors. This is
consistent with our previous report that the expression of steroid receptors (and their change with
treatment) did not differ significantly between
responding and nonresponding tumors.28
Similar observations apply to changes in proliferation indices that occur more frequently than clinical response. We reported this previously with regard
to immunohistochemical staining for Ki6728 but now
demonstrate the same phenomenon with regard to
RNA expression of other markers of proliferation in
the same tumor population. The challenge remains
to explain why the marked reductions in proliferation
indices do not translate into clinical response.
Bioinformatic analysis also indicated that nonresponsive tumors exhibited dissimilarities between
each other with regard to these markers, indicating
heterogeneity in tumors with a primary resistance to
aromatase inhibitors. This is in keeping with the
diverse mechanisms which are suggested for tumor
resistance to aromatase inhibitors in particular8,29
and to endocrine therapies in general.8,30,31
It also can be deduced that the absence of a clinical response is not always associated with the lack
of molecular changes. Therefore, primary resistance
to letrozole should not be equated with hormoneinsensitivity. Indeed, it is possible that compensatory
molecular changes with treatment may be a cause of
clinical resistance.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the
oral presentation given at the Sixth Cambridge Conference on Endocrine and Targeted Manipulation of
Breast Cancer and do not correspond directly to the
written article, which is a more general review.
Dr. Paul Goss: We know that the aromatase inhibitors drop estrogen levels in and around the primary tumor. You can see a set of genes that are
clearly regulated, presumably almost across all of the
tumors, because they all have estrogen-regulated
genes present—including the normal tissues. So you
give the drug, and you see this family of estrogen
genes drop or respond, but those genes don’t predict
the response of the tumor to the therapy. Instead,
another set of genes, which are not estrogen-regulated, do predict the response. The families of genes
that predict response are similar in responders but
not in the non-responders. What does that mean? Is
it that the drug is working on different pathways
from the estrogen pathway as we currently think?

Response and Resistance to Endocrine Tx/Miller et al.

Also, is there a difference in this effect between the
different aromatase inhibitors?
Dr. Miller: In terms of different aromatase inhibitors, we don’t know, because we’ve only looked at
letrozole, but what I’m saying is that if you look at
those classic estrogen-regulated genes, they clearly
go down. We know that estrogen deprivation is
affecting the tumor, because the estrogen-regulating
genes are going down. But there is also another
group of genes, which are not classic estrogen-regulated genes, which change, and that those are influential in predicting between responders and
nonresponders.
Dr. Coombes: I suppose you could argue that the
most suitable molecular targets are the ones which, at
2 weeks, have not altered. You could therefore hypothesize that you’ve already knocked down your estrogenregulated targets, but the ones that you haven’t affected
are the ones that you need drugs against.
Dr. Miller: You could say the molecular endpoint
is a signature which allows you, at 14 days, to determine whether a patient is going to respond or not
respond. The other reason to do this is to understand
something about the biology. The whole idea is to
identify potential targets. Some of the genes do
change with treatment and may be even up-regulated. Maybe the treatment induces these pathways
and thereby achieves a resistance phenotype. If you
know this, then you can add in treatments that circumvent those pathways.
