BACKGROUND. The clinical responses to chemotherapy in lung cancer patients
are unsatisfactory. Thus, the development of more effective anticancer drugs for
lung cancer is urgently needed.

METHODS. A 2-step novel synthetic compound, referred to as 1,1,3-tri(3-indolyl)cyclohexane (3-indole), was generated in high purity and yield. 3-Indole was
tested for its biologic activity in A549, H1299, H1435, CL1-1, and H1437 lung cancer cells. Animal studies were also performed.

RESULTS. The data indicate that 3-indole induced apoptosis in various lung cancer

Indole-induced a concentration-dependent mitochondrial membrane potential
dissipation and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Activation
of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and triggering of DNA damage were also apparent.
Note that 3-indole-induced JNK activation and DNA damage can be partially suppressed by an ROS inhibitor. Apoptosis induced by 3-indole could be abrogated by
ROS or JNK inhibitors, suggesting the importance of ROS and JNK stress-related
pathways in 3-indole-induced apoptosis. Moreover, 3-indole showed in vivo antitumor activities against human xenografts in murine models.

CONCLUSIONS. On the basis of its potent anticancer activity in cell and animal
models, the data suggest that this 2-step synthetic 3-indole compound of high
purity and yield is a potential candidate to be tested as a lead pharmaceutical

ung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer mortality in the
world in both men and women.1,2 Even with multimodality
therapies and the recent advent of novel molecular targeted therapies (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors), the clinical
responses to chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer are still
unsatisfactory, with a 5-year overall survival in many countries generally less than 15%.1 Thus, the development of novel, more effective anticancer drugs for lung cancer is urgently needed.
Natural and synthetic compounds with an indole structure

and synthetic indole structure compounds, such as
ABT-751 and BPR0L075, can cause G2/M arrest and
apoptosis.3-5 Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and 3,30 -diindolylmethane, which are phytochemicals commonly
found in cruciferous vegetables, induce G1 cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis mediated by alterations in
stress-activated protein kinase and activation of a
DNA damage mechanism.6-8 However, these natural
and semisynthetic indole compounds have some disadvantages, such as harsh reaction conditions, long
reaction times, and expensive preparation.
We recently developed a novel 2-step synthesized
indole compound, 1,1,3-tri(3-indolyl)cyclohexane (3indole), in high purity and good yield.9 In the present
study we evaluated the biologic activities especially
of the mechanisms involved in the anticancer growth
activities of 3-indole in cell and animal models. 3Indole induced G1 cell cycle arrest at low concentration
(10 lM) and apoptosis at high concentration (30 lM)
in various human lung cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we found that apoptosis was induced via an
intrinsic mitochondrial pathway involving stress-activated pathways, including reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activities.
The events of apoptosis induced by 3-indole, such as
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dissipation, Bcl-2 inactivation, cytochrome-c release, and
DNA ladder were observed. Moreover, in vivo antitumor activities against human xenografts in murine
preclinical models indicated that 3-indole is a potential candidate to be tested as a lead pharmaceutical
compound for cancer treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
3-Indole
The compound 3-indole was synthesized at the
Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan Normal
University, Taipei, Taiwan. 3-Indole was obtained as
a solid powder in 90% yield. The detailed synthetic
method was described in our previous article (Ko
et al9).
Cell Culture
Human nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells
(A549, H1299, H1437, and CL1-1) were maintained in
DMEM and human NSCLC H1435 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells
were maintained at 378C in a humidified incubator
containing 5% CO2 in air.
Cell Proliferation Assay
Cells were treated with DMSO or various concentrations of 3-indole (2, 10, or 30 lM) for the indicated

times. During the last 30 minutes of treatment the cells
were treated with 0.5 mg/mL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT).
Cell proliferation was measured by the intensity of
the absorbance at a wavelength of 540 nm.

Analysis of Cell Cycle Distribution
The assay was performed according to Kuo et al.5
Cells were incubated with DMSO or various concentrations of 3-indole (10 or 30 lM) for 24 hours.
Determination of cell cycle distribution was performed by FACScan flow cytometer (BD Bioscience,
Mountain View, Calif).
Determination of the Apoptotic DNA Ladder
Fixed cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 lL of DNA extraction buffer (0.2 M
Na2HPO4, 0.1 M citrate acid, and 0.5% Triton X-100,
pH 7.8), and then incubated for 1 hour at 378C. After
centrifugation the supernatant was collected and
incubated with 5 lL RNase A (100 mg/mL) for
1 hour at 378C, followed by digestion with 5 lL proteinase K (20 mg/mL) for 1 hour at 378C. After electrophoresis the gels were stained and imaged.
Evaluation of the Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential
The assay was basically performed according to the
method described by Kuo et al.5 Measurement of
changes in MMP was performed using a FACScan
flow cytometer (BD Bioscience).
Western Blot Analysis
Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. Membranes were blocked and probed
with appropriate dilutions of primary antibody as
recommended by the manufacturer. The primary
antibodies used were caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9,
phospho-p44/42 MAPK, phospho-JNK, and cytochrome-c (all from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid,
NY), Bcl-2, Bax (both from Chemicon, Temecula, Calif),
phospho-c-Jun (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly,
Mass), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, Colo).
Membranes were then incubated with appropriate
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were observed using
Western blot chemiluminescent reagents.
Determination of Caspase Activity
Caspase activity was measured with the caspase colorimetric assay kit (BioVision, Mountain View, Calif)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After
treatment, cells were lysed and the cell lysates were

incubated with various synthetic caspase substrates
(Ac-DEVD-pNA, Ac-LETD-pNA, and Ac-LEHD-pNA)
to measure the activity of caspases-3, -8, and -9,
respectively. After incubation at 378C the absorbance
at 405 nm was measured.

Immunocytochemistry
The localization of mitochondria was detected using
MitoTracker (Invitrogen, La Jolla, Calif) as a fluorescent probe. Cells were treated with DMSO or 30 lM
3-indole for the indicated times. During the last 30
minutes of treatment cells were treated with the
MitoTracker (20 nM). Cellular mitochondria were
observed with an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope (Optical Elements, Dulles, Va).
Determination of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species
The assay was performed as described by Juang
et al.10 Cells were treated with DMSO or 30 lM 3indole for the indicated times. ROS production was
measured using FACScan flow cytometer (BD
Bioscience).
Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis
The assay was performed according to the method
described by Juang et al.10 Cells were collected and
resuspended in 1 3 PBS. PBS-suspended cells were
mixed with 1% low-melting point agarose solution at
a final concentration of 1 3 106 cells per 0.1 mL of
agarose block. The agarose plugs containing purified
DNA were inserted into 1% agarose gels and the
DNA was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
using a FIGE Mapper Electrophoresis System (BioRad, Hercules, Calif) for 16 hours at 128C.

drug treatment were selected based on at least a 2fold change in expression.

Subcutaneous Implantation of Cancer Cells in
Animals and Monitoring of In Vivo Antitumoral
Activity After Drug Treatments
Athymic nu/nu female mice (ICR-Foxn1), 4 to 5
weeks of age, were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Republic of China, Taiwan).
The animals were implanted subcutaneously with 5
3 106 A549 or H1435 lung cancer cells in 0.1 mL
Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) in 1 flank per
mouse. The size of the tumor mass was measured
and the tumor volume was calculated as 1/2 3
length 3 width2 in mm3. In human lung cancer
xenograft studies, when tumors attained a mass of
50 mm3, animals were treated intraperitoneally
with 3-indole at 0.2 mg/day on Days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8
(final dose, 50 mg/kg) or 0.1 mg/day on Days 0, 2, 4,
6, and 8 (final dose, 25 mg/kg), or a vehicle mixture
control. A vehicle mixture contains alcohol / Cremophor EL / saline (2:1:7). The tumor size was measured after drug treatment. Before being sacrificed the
animals were anesthetized and blood samples were
collected by intracardiac puncture for the mice organ
function test. Before organ dissection the animals
were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Tumor samples and mice organ tissues (including the lungs and
kidneys) were resected, fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin for histologic examination,
stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic
evaluation, and examined by a pathologist.

RESULTS
cDNA Microarray Analysis
A549 cells were treated with 30 lM 3-indole for 0, 4,
8, and 12 hours. Experimental A549 RNA was isolated
using Trizol reagent (GIBCO BRL, Life Technology,
Gaithersburg, Md). From each sample, total RNA
(Control universal human reference RNA; Stratagene,
La Jolla, Calif) and experimental A549 RNA were
used to generate cDNA. Microarray slides were
scanned using GenePix 4000B Biochip Analyzer
(Axon Instruments, Burlingame, Calif). Changes in
gene expression were presented as logarithmic ratios
of fluorescence intensities. The logarithmic ratios of
each indicated time were then normalized for each
gene to that of control RNA to obtain the expression
pattern (the log-intensity log2R of the red dye vs the
log-intensity log2G of the green dye, as well as the
log intensity ratio M 5 log2R/G vs the log-intensity
A 5 log2HRG, experimental Cy5 and control Cy3).

3-Indole Induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in
Various Human Lung Cancer Cells
3-Indole is a novel, 2-step synthetic indole compound of high purity and yield. Its structure is shown
in Figure 1A. To test the biologic activity of 3-indole
for anticancer treatment, various human lung cancer
cells including A549, H1299, H1435, CL1-1, and
H1437 were treated with 2, 10, or 30 lM of 3-indole
for the indicated times and cell proliferation was
assessed by the MTT assay. Figure 1B shows that 3indole caused a concentration-dependent reduction
in cell proliferation with apparent inhibition of
growth at low concentration (10 lM) and promotion
of cell death at high concentration (30 lM) in various
human lung cancer cells. To determine the cause of
proliferation inhibition at low concentration (10 lM)
and the promotion of cell death at high concentration (30 lM) of 3-indole we investigated whether cell
cycle arrest and/or apoptosis could be induced in

various human lung cancer cells (A549, H1299,
H1435, CL1-1, and H1437 cells) treated with 3-indole
at 10 and 30 lM for 24 hours. Flow cytometry
indicated that 10 lM of 3-indole caused most cancer
cell lines to accumulate in G1 phase and a substantial
increase in the sub-G1 region (an apoptosis indicator)
resulted from treatment with 30 lM of 3-indole at
24 hours (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the sub-G1 region
was caused by apoptosis we performed a DNA ladder
analysis and found that ladders appeared in various
human NSCLC cells (A549, H1299, H1435, and CL1-1
cells) at 24 hours and in H1437 cells at 48 hours after
3-indole treatment (Fig. 1D).

3-Indole Induced Apoptosis Through the Activation
of the Intrinsic Mitochondrial Pathway
By using Western blot analysis to investigate the
mechanism of 3-indole-induced apoptosis we found
that treatment of A549 cells with 30 lM of 3-indole
resulted in a time-dependent reduction in the levels
of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2. At the same time,
the level of the proapoptotic protein, Bax, was concomitantly increased compared with the cells that
were not treated with 3-indole (Fig. 2A). To further
dissect the apoptosis pathway induced by 3-indole
we performed Western blot analysis for cytochrome-c
release and caspase protein expression and used different fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrates (Ac-DEVDpNA, Ac-LETD-pNA, and Ac-LEHD-pNA) to measure
the activity of caspases-3, -8, and -9, respectively. 3Indole increased the release of cytochrome-c from
mitochondria to cytosol in 8 hours and stimulated
caspases-3, -9 (an indicator of the intrinsic mitochondria pathway) and to a lesser extent caspase-8
(an indicator of the extrinsic membrane receptor
pathway) activities in A549 cells (Fig. 2A,B). Together,
these results showed that 3-indole induced the
execution of apoptosis through the activation of the
mitochondrial pathway.

assay. Data shown are the means of 3 independent experiments; bars, SE.

indicated concentrations for 24 hours. (D) Cell apoptosis assay using electrophoresis indicated that an apoptotic DNA ladder appeared in various human
lung cancer cells at 24 to 48 hours.

3-Indole Induced Apoptosis by Reactive Oxygen
Species Production and DNA Double-Strand Breaks
in A549 Cells
Several studies have shown that loss of mitochondria
membrane potential (MMP) in cells triggers mitochondrial disruption and the generation of ROS.6,11,12
ROSs are known to damage many molecules including proteins, RNA, and DNA.13,14 We examined the
changes in MMP and mitochondrial localization
using DiOC6, a cationic fluorescent probe. A concentration-dependent change in MMP was observed in
15 to 30 minutes (Fig. 2C, upper left panel). The data
in Figure 2C (upper right panel) shows that treatment
with 10 or 30 lM of 3-indole decreased MMP in 4 hours,

Bad, caspase-9, -3, -8, and cytochrome-c in A549 cells. Preparation of cytosolic and membrane fractions was used for cytochrome-c studies. Cells were treated with DMSO or 30 lM of 3-indole in medium for 0, 4, 8, and 12 hours. Blotting experiments were repeated 3 times with similar results. (B) Induction of caspase activity by A549 cells. Cells were treated with 30 lM 3-indole for the indicated times and lysed in caspase buffer. Enzymatic activities of caspase-3, -8,
and -9 proteases were determined with fluorogenic substrates using corresponding caspase colorimetric assay kits. Fold induction in caspase activity was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence of 3-indole-treated samples to that of untreated samples. Data shown are the means of 3 independent experiments;
bars, SE. (C) A concentration-dependent change in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was observed in 15 to 30 minutes (upper left panel). MMP dissipation can be detected up to 12 hours posttreatment at 30 lM (upper right panel). MMP was detected by DiOC6, which is a cationic fluorescent probe. Microscopic observations of A549 cells showed that cells treated with 30 lM 3-indole for 12 hours showed mitochondrial aggregates (lower right panel).

FIGURE 3. 3-Indole induced apoptosis through the activation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA strand breaks. (A) 3-Indole-induced ROS
production was observed in various human lung cancer cells (A549, H1435, and H1437) for 6 hours using DCFH-DA as a fluorescent probe. (B) Treated A549 cells

but only a high concentration (30 lM) of 3-indole
continuously decreased MMP. Moreover, using cell
fluorescence staining mitochondrial localization was
detected by MitoTracker. In untreated cells mitochondria were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm.
In 3-indole (30 lM)-treated A549 cells aggregated mitochondria increased after 12 hours and dendrite-like
structures disappeared (Fig. 2C, lower panel).

Next we examined the changes in ROS production and DNA damage in cells treated with 30 lM of
3-indole. A significant increase in ROS production
was observed in various human NSCLC cells (A549,
H1435, and H1437) at 6 hours (Fig. 3A). In addition,
A549 cells were treated with 3-indole and rotenone
(0.05 lM, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory

(NAC) (5 mM, a hydroxyl radical scavenger). The
results indicated a partial reversal of ROS production
by rotenone (Fig. 3B) and reduced apoptosis during
cotreatment with rotenone or NAC compared with 3indole treatment alone (Fig. 3C). Because there was
an increase in ROS production we decided to assess
the degree of DNA strand break damage using
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A549 cells,
after 30 lM 3-indole treatment, exhibited a change
in DNA damage at 24 hours (Fig. 3D, left panel). In
addition, we treated A549 cells with both 3-indole
and rotenone (0.05 lM). The data indicated that
cotreatment with rotenone reduced DNA damage
compared with 3-indole treatment alone (Fig. 3D,
right panel).

cDNA Microarray Analysis to Search for Differential
Expressed Genes After 3-Indole Treatment
To reveal more potential targets and pathways
involved in 3-indole treatment we performed cDNA
microarray analysis on A549 cells treated with 30 lM
of 3-indole and harvested the RNA at 0, 4, 8, and 12

hours. The dose chosen was close to the dose needed
for apoptosis induction. The rationale for the indicated times was to capture the expression profiles of
genes that were involved in the apoptotic processes.
We found many differentially expressed genes that
are related to cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell-signaling
pathways (Table 1). For example, we found that
30 lM of 3-indole caused changes in the mRNA
levels of several mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling proteins such as p38b and JNK2.

Activation of the JNK Signaling Pathways Is Required for
the Induction of Apoptosis in 3-Indole-Treated A549 Cells
cDNA microarray data revealed that expression of
several proteins in the MAPK pathway changed after
3-indole treatment. In addition, ROS has been shown
to induce various biologic processes, including activation of the MAPK pathway.6,15 Therefore, we performed Western blot to confirm whether the MAPK
signaling pathway was activated after 3-indole treatment and whether ROS was involved in 3-indoleinduced MAPK activation. Cell lysates were subjected

to Western blot analysis using antiphospho-MAPK
antibodies (ERK1 of 2, JNK, and p38) to detect
phosphorylated activated MAPK family proteins. The
data in the left panel of Figure 4A shows that 3indole increased the activation of JNK1 in 4 hours
and JNK2 in 8 hours. In addition, we found that 3indole increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun, a
major nuclear factor of the MAPK signaling pathway,
in 4 to 12 hours. Furthermore, we cotreated A549
cells with rotenone (0.05 lM), SP600125 (20 lM, an
inhibitor of JNK), or U0126 (10 lM, an inhibitor of
ERK). The results indicated that cotreatment of 3indole with rotenone or SP600125 reduced activated
JNK and c-Jun protein expression compared with 3indole treatment alone (Fig. 4A, right panel). The
data in Figure 4B shows that treatment of A549 cells

with a combination of the JNK inhibitor and 3-indole
caused a significant reduction in 3-indole-induced
apoptosis when compared with the cells treated with
3-indole alone, whereas no effect of ERK inhibitor on
3-indole-induced apoptosis was seen. In addition,
cotreatment with 3-indole and SP600125 reduced
DNA damage compared with 3-indole treatment
alone (Fig. 3D, right panel). The results indicated
that inhibition of JNK activation protects against the
cytotoxic effects of 3-indole and that ROS may play a
role in JNK activation.

growth in 3-indole and vehicle-treated animals (ICRFoxn1). Solvent control cells were treated with a
vehicle mixture of alcohol / Cremophor EL / saline
(2:1:7). To further determine the effect of 3-indole
over an extended treatment period, tumor size was
measured in each animal. In the meantime, 3indole-treated animals were sacrificed and processed
for evaluation of any possible changes in histopathology and serum biochemistry.
Figure 5A shows the tumor growth in control vehicle-treated animals compared with 3-indole treatments. Treatment with 3-indole (25 or 50 mg/kg
intraperitoneally) resulted in tumor growth inhibition

compared with that produced by control vehicletreated animals bearing A549 cell xenografts (Fig. 5A,
left panel). The same observations were also noted in
an H1435 cell xenograft model (Fig. 5A right panel).
Evaluation of numerous histologic sections of these
tissues from animals bearing human A549 xenografts
did not indicate any detectable pathologic abnormalities, as examined by H&E staining (Fig. 5B). In addition, 3-indole therapy caused no detectable toxicity
on tissues and did not affect organ functions. The
organ function tests included liver function tests,
such as glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and albumin

levels, and renal function tests, such as blood urea
nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The organ
functions were similar between the 3-indole-treated
and the vehicle-treated groups (Fig. 5C).

DISCUSSION
We evaluated the biologic activities, especially the
mechanisms, involved in the anticancer growth of 3indole in cell and animal models. 3-Indole caused
an accumulation in the G1 phase at a low concentration (10 lM), and increased in the sub-G1 region
(an apoptosis indicator) in all lung cancer cell lines
at a high concentration (30 lM). DNA ladders
appeared in various human lung cells in a time-dependent manner after 3-indole treatment. Apoptosis
occurs through 2 main pathways. The first pathway
involves a member of the TNF receptor superfamily
(extrinsic) and the second pathway involves the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway.16 The Bcl-2 family of
proteins constitutes a critical mediator in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.16 Our results
showed that treatment of A549 cells with 30 lM of
3-indole resulted in a time-dependent reduction in
the levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Concomitantly, the level of proapoptotic Bax protein was
increased. Furthermore, the progression of apoptosis
involves the activation of a cascade of proteases
called caspases. Theoretically, the extrinsic pathway
is related to the activation of caspase-8 and the
intrinsic pathway is associated with activation of
caspase-9. Both pathways converge to a common
pathway involving the activation of caspase-3. As
shown in our data, 3-indole apparently stimulated
caspases-3, caspase-9 and to a lesser extent caspase8 activities in A549 cells. Together, these results suggested that 3-indole induced the execution of apoptosis through the activation of the intrinsic
mitochondrial pathway.
Various physical and chemical environmental
stresses can activate apoptosis.17 One example of
environmental stress-induced apoptosis is the loss of
MMP in cells and the subsequent induction of ROS by
electron leakage from the mitochondrial electron
transport chain. Various cancer cells have low expression of some antioxidant enzymes (ie, catalase and
superoxide dismutase),18 suggesting that induction of
ROS in cancer cells may exhibit a potential target
effect. Our data indicated that MMP was decreased
within 4 hours in A549 cells and a significant increase
in ROS production was observed by 6 to 8 hours in various human lung cancer cells. Furthermore, the ROS
induced by 3-indole can be partially reduced by an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I
and a hydroxyl radical scavenger. Considerable evi-

823

dence indicated that ROS, as signaling transduction
molecules, induced apoptosis by the mitochondria
pathway and DNA damage activation. Therefore, we
hypothesized that 3-indole may cause DNA damage.
PFGE analyses showed that 3-indole triggers DNA
strand breaks in treated A549 cells in a time-dependent manner and the triggered DNA damage can be
partially recovered by incubation of 3-indole-treated
cells with an ROS inhibitor. In addition, 3-indoleinduced apoptosis can be rescued by cotreatment
with ROS inhibitors. Together, these results suggested
that oxidative stress may potentially trigger 3-indoleinduced DNA damage and may lead to apoptosis.
ROS have been shown to induce various biological processes, including activation of MAPK.6,15 JNKinduced apoptosis has been shown to occur through
the mitochondria6,19 and to require the presence of
Bcl-2 family proteins.20,21 Our data indicated that
ROS may mediate the activation of the JNK pathway
and ultimately lead to cytotoxic effects such as DNA
damage formation and apoptosis induced by 3indole. Furthermore, cDNA microarray data indicated
that 3-indole affect other signaling pathways, such as
PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. It is noteworthy that we also found that 3-indole caused a
reduction in expression of the histone deacetylase 1
(HDAC1), which highly expresses and correlates with
proliferative status in a variety of cancer cells.22,23
HDAC1 has been identified as a potential target for
cancer treatment.24 Further studies on the role of
HDAC1, upstream effectors of MAPK pathway, and
other signaling pathways such as cell cycle control,
angiogenesis, and metastasis during 3-indoleinduced apoptosis are under investigation. In the
present study we have shown for the first time that a
novel synthetic indole structure compound, 3-indole,
exhibits strong antitumor activities in both cell and
animal models. 3-Indole treatment induced remarkable tumor growth inhibition in treated animals. Toxicity in many tissues after chemotherapy is a major
clinical concern.25 The predominant organs for drugs
and chemicals metabolism are liver and kidney.26,27
Therefore, we evaluated serum biochemistry of liver
and kidney functions in treated mice as a preliminary indicator of safety. Furthermore, evaluation of
numerous histologic sections of tissues from animals
bearing human A549 lung carcinoma tumor xenografts did not show any detectable pathologic
abnormalities, as revealed by H&E staining. Importantly, at preclinical animal-treated doses of 3-indole,
no organ function damage in the liver or kidneys
were observed in vivo. These data indicated that 3indole is a potential to be tested as a lead pharmaceutical compound for cancer treatment.

In conclusion, our data indicated that the 2-step
synthetic 3-indole with high purity and yield induced
intrinsic mitochondria pathway apoptosis in various
lung cancer cells. In vivo antitumor activities against
human xenografts support that 3-indole is a potential
lead anticancer compound based on its strong tumor
growth inhibition with favorable pharmacologic
properties. In addition, 3-indole induced a time-dependent increase in ROS production and triggered
DNA damage. The activation of the JNK pathway
induced by 3-indole may be mediated through ROS.
Such a multifactorial effect of an anticancer drug has
also been shown for other indole compounds, such
as I3C.28,29 I3C has been shown to induce different
enzyme activities in vitro and in vivo when given by
different methods. The epiphenomenon suggests that
3-indole metabolic products in vivo, not the parent
compound, represent the prerequisite for anticarcinogenesis.30 Because the cytotoxic dose of 3-indole
used in the current study is relatively high compared
with several anticancer drugs, we are currently examining the cytotoxicity effect of 3-indole in cultured
cells incubated with liver extract, which contains
many metabolic enzymes. The preliminary data indicate a dramatic reduction of the IC50 value of 3indole in various lung cancer cell lines during coincubation with liver extract. The result suggests that
the effects of 3-indole that appeared at 30 lM in our
cell culture studies may be because 3-indole is a
proximate anticarcinogen that needs further metabolic activation to exhibit its full cytotoxic effect in a
cancer cell model. Characterization of in vivo metabolites of 3-indole is under the investigation. In addition, in vivo toxicity and the pharmacologic kinetics
of 3-indole need to be further verified.
