ABSTRACT
p53 plays a key role in regulating DNA damage response by suppressing cell cycle
progression or inducing apoptosis depending on extent of DNA damage. However,
it is not clear why mild genotoxic stress favors growth arrest, whereas excessive
lesions signal cells to die. Here we showed that TAp73, a p53 homologue thought
to have a similar function as p53, restrains the transcriptional activity of p53 and
prevents excessive activation of its downstream targets upon low levels of DNA
damage, which results in cell cycle arrest. Extensive DNA damage triggers TAp73
depletion through ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of E2F1, leading to
enhanced transcriptional activation by p53 and subsequent induction of apoptosis.
These findings provide novel insights into the regulation of p53 function and suggest
that TAp73 keeps p53 activity in check in regulating cell fate decisions upon genotoxic
stress.

in two major isoform classes, including TAp73 and
ΔNp73, which have distinct functions [7]. Similar to p53,
TAp73 isoforms contain highly conserved DNA binding,
transactivation, and oligomerization domains, whereas
ΔNp73 lacks the transactivation domain but contains
DNA-binding and oligomerization domains [7]. Following
DNA damage, TAp73 can bind to the same set of p53responsive elements and activate p53 target genes to
arrest cell cycle or induce apoptosis [8]. Although TAp73
was shown to be a tumor suppressor [9, 10], it is rarely
mutated in human tumors [11], and p73-deficient mice do
not resemble p53-null mice in tumor phenotypes [9, 12].
Unlike p53, which is consistently proapoptotic, TAp73
can be proapoptotic or antiapoptotic [13, 14]. TAp73
expression can be either upregulated or downregulated in
response to different DNA damaging agents [15]. These
observations suggest that the function of p73 does not
overlap with that of p53 in DNA damage response.
A fundamental and unresolved issue is how cells
respond to different levels of stress. It is unclear why
transient or low levels of DNA damage suppress cell
growth, but extensive and persistent lesions often lead

INTRODUCTION
Mammalian cells have developed an intricate
molecular network to deal with DNA damage inflicted
by frequent environmental or endogenous insults [1].
Depending on various factors, DNA damage can trigger
DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis [2]. The central
regulator of DNA damage response is the tumor suppressor
p53, which either inhibits cell growth by activating p21, 143-3σ, and other cell cycle regulators, or induces apoptosis
through proapoptotic targets such as PUMA, Noxa and Bax
[3]. DNA damage response is essential for maintenance
of genomic integrity and functions as a guardian against
oncogenic transformation [4]. Tumor cells are almost
invariably defective in DNA damage response due to defects
in the p53 and other DNA repair pathways [4]. Furthermore,
ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs used in
anticancer therapies often kill tumor cells by inducing toxic
levels of DNA damage [5].
In addition to p53, several other p53 family
members, such as p73 and p63, also play a significant
role in DNA damage response [6]. p73 is expressed

to apoptosis. Recent studies indicate that specific events
can be triggered by excessive DNA damage to alert
neighboring cells, or to eliminate the damaged cells by
apoptosis [16]. However, little is known about how p53
activity is adjusted in response to different stress levels. In
this study, we uncovered a function of TAp73 in restraining
p53 activity in response to low levels of DNA damage. In
the context of extensive DNA damage, depletion of TAp73
leads to enhanced proapoptotic activities of p53. Our
results provide insight into cell fate determination through
the interplay of p53 family members.

Downregulation of TAp73 was not a consequence of
caspase activation, as no TAp73 cleavage fragment was
observed (Fig. S1, D and E), and caspase inhibition
blocked apoptosis without affecting TAp73 depletion
(Fig. S2). Furthermore, downregulation of TAp73 was also
observed in p53-WT LOVO and RKO, and p53-mutant
DLD1 colon cancer cells, as well as in mouse embryonic
fibroblast (MEF) cells, following cisplatin treatment
at a dose that induced substantial γH2Ax and apoptosis
(Fig. 1F and data not shown). Therefore, TAp73 is induced
by low levels of DNA damage, but is downregulated upon
exposure to lethal doses of DNA damage.

RESULTS

TAp73 inhibits apoptosis and expression of p53
target genes following excessive DNA damage

Downregulation of TAp73 following extensive
DNA damage

We then determined whether TAp73 downregulation
is involved in initiating apoptosis in response to high
levels of DNA damage. TAp73 transfection markedly
suppressed apoptosis and caspase activation induced by
50 μM cisplatin, slightly reduced low levels of apoptosis
and caspase activation induced by 12.5 μM cisplatin,
but had no effect on untreated cells (Fig. 2A and S3A).
Enforced TAp73 expression also inhibited protein and
mRNA induction of p53 downstream targets, including
PUMA, Bax and p21, in cells exposed to 12.5 or 50 μM
cisplatin (Fig. 2, B and C). Conversely, knockdown of
p73 by siRNA sensitized cells to apoptosis induction (Fig.
2D), and enhanced the protein and mRNA expression
of PUMA, Bax and p21 following cisplatin treatment at
12.5 or 50 μM (Fig. 2, E and F). These effects of TAp73
depletion were verified in HCT116 cells with stable
knockdown of TAp73 by shRNA, which by itself did
not affect the expression of ΔNp73 and p63 isoforms,
or induce genotoxic stress or apoptosis (Fig. 2, G-J;
Fig. S3B). Modulating TAp73 expression also did not
affect the induction of p53 by cisplatin (Fig. 2, B, E
and J). Furthermore, TAp73 transfection or knockdown
had similar effects on the induction of apoptosis and
p53 target genes by cisplatin in RKO colon cancer cells
(Fig.  S4,  A-D), as well as that by 5-FU in HCT116
cells (Fig. S5, A-D). In contrast, TAp73 transfection or
knockdown did not affect p53-independent induction of
apoptosis and PUMA by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine
[17], although TAp73 was also downregulated in response
to staurosporine treatment (Fig. S6, A-E).
To determine whether the effects of TAp73 are
mediated through p53, we analyzed p53-knockout (p53KO) HCT116 cells. Treating p53-KO cells with 50 μM
cisplatin downregulated TAp73, but did not induce the
expression of PUMA, Bax, and p21 (Fig. 3A), and led
to a lower level of apoptosis compared to WT HCT116
cells (Fig. 3B). TAp73 transfection or knockdown did
not affect the induction of apoptosis and p53 target genes
in p53-KO cells (Fig. 3, B-D), and in p53-mutant DLD1
cells (Fig.  S4, E and F). PUMA plays a critical role in

There are at least 30 p73 transcript isoforms
generated by two different promoters (TA and ΔN)
and extensive alternative slicing. TAp73α is the most
prominent and transcriptionally competent p73 isoform
that resembles p53 [7]. To distinguish TAp73 from
ΔNp73, a triple-Flag tag (3×Flag) was knocked into the
N-terminus of TAp73 in p53-wildtype (WT) HCT116
colon cancer cells (Fig. S1, A and B). TAp73α (TAp73
hereafter) in the Flag-knock-in (Flag-KI) cells could be
specifically detected by Flag western blotting (Fig. S1C).
No other TAp73 isoforms, such as TAp73β, could be
detected in HCT116 cells (Fig. S1, D and E). Knock-in of
the Flag tag does not affect the sensitivity of HCT116 cells
to DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Fig. S1F).
To investigate the role of TAp73 in DNA damage
response, Flag-KI cells were treated with several DNA
damaging agents at various concentrations. Both knockin and endogenous forms of TAp73 were induced by a
24-hr treatment with either 12.5 μM cisplatin, 12.5 μM
etoposide, 0.125 μM camptothecin (CPT), or 12.5 μg/ml
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) (Fig. 1A, S1D and S1E), and TAp73
accumulation was detected through 36 hr after treatment
with 12.5 μM cisplatin (Fig. 1B). These conditions induced
relatively low levels of DNA damage indicated by histone
2Ax phosphorylation (γH2Ax), modest and delayed
(after 24 hr) substantial induction of p53 target genes
(Fig. 1A and 1B), and predominantly cell cycle arrest,
but little apoptosis or caspase activation (Fig. 1, C-E).
Treating cells with DNA damaging agents at escalated
doses, including 50 μM cisplatin, 50 μM etoposide,
0.5 μM CPT, and 50 μg/ml 5-FU, led to higher levels of
DNA damage, p53, and its target genes (Fig. 1, A and B),
as well as strong apoptosis and caspase activation (Fig.
1, C-E), but surprisingly diminished expression of TAp73
(Fig. 1, A and B). Upon exposure to 50 μM cisplatin or
50 μg/ml 5-FU, TAp73 expression was initially increased
up to 18 hr, but markedly declined afterwards, followed
by enhanced expression of p53 target genes (Fig. 1B).

substantially affect cisplatin-induced apoptosis without
PUMA (Fig. S7, A-D). Both p53 and TAp73 can bind
to the p53 responsive elements in the PUMA promoter
upon DNA damage [19, 20]. To determine whether the
effects of TAp73 on PUMA expression and apoptosis
are mediated by its action on the PUMA promoter, we
analyzed HCT116 cells with a deletion of the p53 binding
sites in the PUMA promoter (BS-KO) [17]. In the absence
of the p53 binding sites, TAp73 transfection or depletion
did not impact cisplatin-induced apoptosis and PUMA
expression, but still suppressed p21 expression as in WT
HCT116 cells (Fig. 3, E and F; Fig. S7, E and F). These
results demonstrate specific inhibitory effects of TAp73 on
DNA damage-induced apoptosis, which are meditated by
p53 through its downstream target genes.

fluorescence polarization and GST-tagged recombinant
p53 and TAp73 proteins. Recombinant p53 and TAp73
were found to bind to a synthetic PUMA promoter probe
with an equilibrium binding constant (Kd) of 29.55 nM
and 87.12 nM, respectively (Fig. 5A), suggesting that
p73 is less efficient in DNA binding compared to p53 and
may not directly compete out p53 at the p53 responsive
elements. ChIP analysis showed that co-transfection of
p53 and TAp73 attenuated the binding of both proteins
to the promoters of PUMA, p21, Bax and Noxa, relative
to transfection of p53 or TAp73 alone (Fig. 5B). Farwestern blotting showed that co-expression of p53 and
TAp73 in p53-KO cells abolished the in vitro binding
of both proteins to the PUMA promoter probe (Fig. 5C).
Furthermore, the binding of p53 or TAp73 to the PUMA
promoter probe was inhibited by titration of TAp73 or p53
in fluorescence polarization assays, whereas the control
GST-tagged X-linked IAP (XIAP) had no effect on the
binding of p53 and TAp73 (Fig. 5D). Therefore, the
presence of TAp73 can impair the ability of p53 to bind
to DNA. Using gel filtration column chromatography,
we found that both p53 and TAp73 peak fractions
concordantly shifted to a higher molecular weight (MW)
range in cells treated with 12.5 μM cisplatin (Fig. 5E),
compared to untreated cells, suggesting formation of
large and likely transcriptionally incompetent complexes.
In contrast, the shifts of p53 and TAp73 fractions were
less pronounced in cells treated with 50 μM cisplatin
(Fig. 5E). TAp73 transfection led to similar shifts of p53
peak fractions as that caused by 12.5 μM cisplatin (Fig.
5F). Together, these results suggest that TAp73 inhibits
p53 activity by forming protein complexes that are unable
to efficiently bind to DNA.

TAp73 inhibits DNA binding and transactivation
by p53 following DNA damage
To determine a potential role of p53 and TAp73
occupancy on promoters of p53 target genes, we used
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to analyze the
binding of p53 and TAp73 to several promoters in
cisplatin-treated Flag-KI cells. In response to 12.5 μM
cisplatin for 24 hr, p53 was recruited to its target gene
promoters, while TAp73 was selectively recruited to the
promoters of PUMA, p21 and 14-3-3σ (Fig. 4A and S8A).
In response to 50 μM cisplatin for 24 hr, the binding of p53
to its target promoters markedly increased, while that of
TAp73 decreased (Fig. 4A and S8A). The binding of p53
to its target gene promoters upon cisplatin exposure was
markedly suppressed by transfection with TAp73 (Fig. 4B
and S8B), while significantly increased upon knockdown
of TAp73 (Fig. 4C and S8C). Furthermore, cisplatin dose
escalation resulted in increased Histone H4 acetylation, a
chromatin remodeling marker of transcriptional activation,
in the PUMA and p21 promoter regions (Fig. 4D). TAp73
transfection almost completely abolished cisplatin-induced
H4 acetylation, whereas p53 transfection had an opposite
effect (Fig. 4D). TAp73 transfection also suppressed the
activation of PUMA and p21 luciferase reporters by p53
in a dose-dependent manner in p53-KO cells (Fig. 4E).
Together, these results indicate that upon sub-lethal DNA
damage, TAp73 restricts p53 transcriptional activity, while
excessive DNA damage downregulates TAp73 to unleash
the full activity of p53 to drive apoptosis induction.

Downregulation of p73 by ubiquitin/proteasomemediated E2F1 degradation in response to
excessive DNA damage
We next investigated the mechanism by which
TAp73 expression is regulated in response to different
levels of DNA damage. The mRNA expression of TAp73,
but not that of ΔNp73, TAp63, and ΔNp63, was markedly
decreased following treatment with 50 μM cisplatin (Fig.
6A and S9). The expression of E2F1, a key transcription
factor that regulates TAp73 and DNA damage response
[21, 22], as well as E2F1 bound to p73 promoter, were
decreased upon 50 μM cisplatin (Fig. 6, B and C). E2F1
depletion was also detected in cells treated with 50 μg/ml
5-FU (Fig. S10A). E2F1 transfection blocked the
downregulation of TAp73 protein and mRNA in cells
treated with 50 μM cisplatin (Fig. 6, D and E). Conversely,
E2F1 knockdown enhanced TAp73 depletion (Fig. 6, F
and G). Similar effects of E2F1 on TAp73 expression
were also observed in RKO colon cancer cells exposed to
cisplatin (Fig. S10, B and C).

TAp73 and p53 inhibit each other in DNA
binding and form protein complexes
Several possibilities may explain how TAp73
inhibits p53-mediated transactivation, such as competitive
binding to the same promoter and inhibiting formation
of transcription-competent p53 tetramers. We examined
the former by an equilibrium binding assay using

We further investigated the mechanism of E2F1
depletion. Unlike TAp73, the mRNA expression of
E2F1 was not decreased, but slightly increased upon
cisplatin exposure, compared to untreated cells (Fig.

E2F1 depletion upon 50 μM cisplatin. The increased E2F1
mRNA expression may account for the increased E2F1

protein expression upon 12.5 μM cisplatin (Fig. 6B).

to 12.5 μM cisplatin to 3–6 hr upon 50 μM cisplatin

cisplatin (Fig. 7C). Ubiquitination of both endogenous
and transfected E2F1 (analyzed in normalized cell lysates)
was markedly enhanced following treatment with 50 μM
cisplatin, compared to untreated cells or those treated with
12.5 μM cisplatin (Fig. 7, D and E). MG132 treatment
also impeded the declined expression of p73 mRNA and
protein (Fig. 7, C and F). Knockdown of E2F1 suppressed
the effect of MG132 on TAp73 expression in response
to 50 μM cisplatin (Fig. 7G). Since MG132 alone only
slightly increased TAp73 level (Fig. 7C), the E2F1dependent effect of MG132 on TAp73 expression suggests
that downregulation of TAp73 is mediated by proteasomal
degradation of E2F rather than TAp73 itself. However, the
effects of MG132 cannot be directly correlated with the
E2F1/p73 pathway, as proteasome inhibition has multiple
cellular effects including severe cellular damage. To further
understand the mechanism of E2F1 degradation, we probed
ATM, an upstream regulator of DNA damage response [4].
The E2F1 depletion was found to be mediated by ATM,
as co-treatment with the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 restored
E2F1 expression upon 50 μM cisplatin (Fig. 7H). Together,
these results demonstrate that lethal DNA damage triggers
ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated E2F1 degradation and p73
downregulation to facilitate p53-dependent apoptosis.

adeno-associated virus) System [23]. Briefly, two
homologous arms of ~1.32 kb and 0.995 kb, respectively,
flanking the second intron of TAp73 were inserted
between 2 USER sites in the AAV shuttle vector pTKNeo-USER (Fig. S1A). Coding sequence of a triple-Flag
tag was introduced by PCR into the left arm immediately
3’ following the initiation ATG codon of TAp73α, as
previously described [24]. For gene targeting, HCT116
cells, in which TAp73 is the most prominently expressed
p73 isoform [25], were infected with the targeting rAAV
and selected by G418 (0.5 mg/mL; Mediatech) for
3 weeks. G418-resistant clones were pooled and screened
by PCR for targeting events using the primer pair listed
in Table S1. After gene targeting, Neo was excised by
Cre adenovirus infection. Gene targeting was verified by
sequencing of genomic DNA and analysis of Flag-TAp73
expression using western blotting.

Apoptosis and caspase activity assays
After treatment, adherent and floating cells were
harvested and resuspended with PBS solution containing
3.7 % formaldehyde, 0.5 % Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/
ml Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen). Apoptosis was assessed
through microscopic visualization and counting of
cells with condensed chromatin and micronucleations
as described [26]. For each measurement, at least three
independent experiments and a minimum of 300 cells
were analyzed. For annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)
staining, cells were stained by annexin Alexa-488/PI
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instruction,
and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Caspase activity
was measured using the SensoLyte Homogeneous AMC
Caspase-3/7 Assay Kit (Anaspec). Briefly, 1.0×104
HCT116 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate.
After treatment, cells were incubated with the caspase
substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC at room temperature for
40 min. Fluorescence was measured using a Wallac Victor
1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer), and the data are
presented as relative fluorescence units.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and drug treatment
Human colorectal cancer cell lines, including
HCT116, RKO, LOVO, which contain WT p53, and
DLD1, which contains mutant p53, were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas,
VA). p53-KO and PUMA-KO HCT116 cells were obtained
from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive
Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins). p53-binding site
knockout (BS-KO) HCT116 cells and immortalized
MEF cells were previously described [17]. Colon
cancer cells were maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium
(Invitrogen). MEF cells were cultured using Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (BioWhittaker). All cell culture
media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(HyClone), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 µg/ml of
streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 oC in 5 % CO2
atmosphere.
Cells were plated in 12-well plates at 40–50% density
24 hr before treatment. Cisplatin, etoposide, 5-Fluorouracil
(5-FU), camptothecin and staurosporine (Sigma) were
diluted to different concentrations in cell culture medium.
In some experiments, cells were treated with DNA
damaging drugs for 18 hr, and then with the proteasome
inhibitor MG 132 (Sigma) for an additional 6 hr.

Transfection and siRNA/shRNA knockdown
Transfection of expression constructs and
small interfering RNA (siRNA) was performed using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Expression constructs,
including pCMV-Neo-Bam p53 WT (from Dr. Bert
Vogelstein), HA-TAp73α-pcDNA3 (from Dr. William
Kaelin) and pSG5L-HA-E2F1 (from Dr. William Sellers),
were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). siRNA
(Dharmacon) of 200 pmol each was transfected into cells
24 hr before drug treatment. The siRNA sequences have
been previously described, including those for human
TAp73 (5¢-GGATTCCAGCATGGACGTCTT-3¢) [27],
and human E2F1 (5¢-GGACCTTCGTAGCATTGCA-3¢)
[28]. Stable TAp73 knockdown cells were generated

lentiviral vector (Addgene) expressing shRNA with the
same targeting sequence as the TAp73 siRNA. Lentiviral
particles were generated by co-transfecting 293T cells
with the lentiviral vector, pMD2.G (VSVG), pMDLg/
pRRE, and pRSV-REV (Addgene). Following lentiviral
transduction, cells were plated in 96-well plates in the
presence of puromycin (2 μg/ml; EMD/Millipore). TAp73

Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR
Total RNA was isolated by using Quick-RNA miniprep kit (ZYMO Research, Irvine, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, and subjected to reverse
transcription to generate cDNA. Real-time RT-PCR was
performed on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) with SYBR Green (Invitrogen). Primers for
RT-PCR are listed in Table S1. Agarose gel electrophoresis
of the PCR products was used to verify the specificity of
PCR amplification.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
For analysis of promoter binding by p53 and
E2F1, and histone H4 acetylation, ChIP was carried out
by using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay
Kit (Upstate/Millipore), as previously described [17].
Antibodies against p53 (SC-126), E2F1 (SC-251) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), acetylated histone H4 (#06–598;
Upstate/Millipore) were used. Isotype-matched IgG
(R&D System) were used as control for IP. For analysis of
promoter binding by TAp73, HCT116 cells with knockin of Flag-TAp73 were treated and analyzed. IP was
performed using EZview Red ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity
Gel (Sigma) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Parental HCT116 cells were used as the negative control.
After ChIP, the IP complex was analyzed by PCR using
the primers listed in Table S1. In some experiments, cells
were first transfected with HA-TAp73α, TAp73 siRNA,
p53, or both HA-TAp73α and p53. Twenty-four hr after
transfection, cells were treated with cisplatin and analyzed
by ChIP for p53 using anti-p53, or for TAp73 using antiHA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Ubiquitination Assay
To detect E2F1 ubiquitination following cisplatin
treatment, HCT116 cells with or without transfection of
pSG5L-HA-E2F1 were treated with cisplatin for 18 hr,
and then with 5 μM MG 132 for an additional 6 hr. IP of
endogenous and transfected E2F1 was performed using
anti-E2F1 and anti-HA, respectively. IP complexes were
pulled down using EZview Red Protein G Affinity Gel
(Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
lysed in 2×Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed for
ubiquitin by western blotting.

volume at room temperature in a buffer containing 100
mM NaCl, 10 mM tris-HCl, PH7.5, 10% (vol/vol)
glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum

was used as negative control with an initial concentration
of 4 nM in 500-μL reaction volume as well. Data were
analyzed as previous described [32].
To analyze DNA binding by p53 and TAp73 using
far-western blotting, cell lysates prepared from p53KO HCT116 cells transfected with p53, HA-TAp73α,
or both proteins were incubated with 2 μg of the duplex

Luciferase reporter assay
For analysis of PUMA and p21 promoter activities,
p53-KO HCT116 cells were transfected with a PUMA
luciferase reporter containing the p53 binding site
(Fragment A) [29] or p21 luciferase reporter (Addgene,
Plasmid 16451), along with HA-p73α-pcDNA3 and/or
pCMV-Neo-Bam p53 WT, and the control β-galactosidase
reporter pCMVβ (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Luciferase activities were measured and normalized to
those of β-galactosidase, as previously described [30].
Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at
least three times.

promoters can profoundly affect promoter choice and
cell fate determination [34]. A number of p53 partner
proteins have been implicated in modulating the selection
of p53 targets, such as Brn3a and YB1, which favor
growth arrest, and ASPP family members, p300, and
CAS, which are proapoptotic [35, 36]. Hzf, a zinc finger
protein that interacts with p53, can selectively induce
p53 targets involved in growth arrest. Prolonged DNA
damage exposure led to Hzf degradation and enhanced
expression of the proapoptotic targets of p53 [37]. TAp73
appears to be different from Hzf as it regulates overall
p53 activity rather than target selectivity. While TAp73 is
modulated in response to altered extent of DNA damage,
Hzf is altered upon changes in duration of DNA damage.
Furthermore, different post-translational modifications
of p53 also regulate selective expression of p53 targets
[38]. In addition to p53, excessive DNA damage can also
activate an NF-kB-dependent pathway to induce cytokine
secretion and apoptosis [16]. Therefore, a set of wellorchestrated events including TAp73 depletion are set
forth in response to lethal DNA damage to signal cells
death through apoptosis.
TAp73 contains a highly-conserved DNA-binding
domain and shares sequence specificity with p53 [39]. It
is possible that TAp73 simply competes with p53 for DNA
binding to prevent the activation of p53 target genes [40].
However, our data are inconsistent with this hypothesis.
TAp73 binds less tightly than p53 to the PUMA promoter
(Fig. 5A). TAp73 and p53 co-expression or co-incubation
abolished DNA binding by both proteins in cells and
in vitro binding assays (Fig. 5, B-D). Several p73 and
p63 isoforms can physically interact with each other or
with mutant p53 [41, 42]. In the context of mild DNA
damage, p73 seems to antagonize p53 activity through the
formation of large protein complexes (Fig. 5, E and F).
These complexes might lack symmetric conformation and
cooperativity required for binding to the p53 responsive
elements. In support of our findings, DNA binding
cooperativity of p53 has been shown to determine the
extent of DNA damage-induced apoptosis [43]. It should
be noted that the DNA binding and transactivation of both
p53 and TAp73 are subjected to extensive modifications
following DNA damage [44]. Our data cannot completely
rule out the possibility that p53 and TAp73 compete with
each other for DNA binding.
Despite numerous studies on p53 homologues and
clarification of TAp73 as a tumor suppressor [9, 10], the
precise function of TAp73 in DNA damage response and
tumor suppression is not fully understood [45]. TAp73
is often proapoptotic, but could be antiapoptotic under
certain circumstances [46, 47]. In contrast to our findings,
TAp73 was shown to be proapoptotic in HCT116 cells
in response to the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3, which
might be due to the effects of Nutlin-3 on p53 and other
MDM2 targets [48]. The proapoptotic activity of TAp73

Gel filtration column chromatography
Gel filtration column chromatography was carried
out as previously described [33]. In brief, 3 mg of whole
cell extracts prepared in a column elution buffer (30 mM
HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 10% glycerol; 0.1%
NP-40; 5 μg/ml DNase I; and protease inhibitor cocktail
[Roche]) were loaded on a column packed with Superose
6 prep grade gel (GE Healthcare), and 500-μl elution
was collected in each fraction. Equal volumes of eluted
fractions were subjected to western blotting. A mixture
of protein markers containing blue dextran (2,000 kDa),
β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa),
and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) was used as the molecular
weight standard.

Discussion
In response to mild and repairable DNA damage,
low levels of p53 induction tend to favor growth arrest,
whereas severe, extended, or irrepairable DNA damage
often leads to apoptosis. Our results indicate that TAp73
plays a critical role in controlling overall p53 activity
and cell fate determination in response to DNA damage
(Fig. 7I). TAp73 binds to p53 and inhibits p53-mediated
transactivation following mild DNA damage, resulting
in limited activation of p53 target genes to favor growth
inhibition. Excessive DNA lesions lead to TAp73 depletion
and enhanced p53 activation and trigger apoptosis.
Although the expression of p53 target genes, such as
PUMA and p21, is similarly modulated in response to
different levels of DNA damage through TAp73 and p53,
the impact of these changes on cell fates may be different
due to differential threshold activities involved in different
biological responses. While modest induction of p21 is
probably sufficient to halt cell cycle progression, strong
induction of PUMA and other apoptosis regulators may
be necessary for efficient apoptosis induction. Following
high levels of DNA damage, TAp73 expression sharply
declined (Fig. 1A and B), but apoptosis induction was less
dramatic and exhibited a dose response (Fig. 1C). This can
probably be explained by the indirect and partial effects
of TAp73 on apoptosis induction, which is regulated by
TAp73 through p53 and its target genes, as well as other
apoptosis regulators.
Differential p53 response can result from selective
expression of p53 targets through several mechanisms.

is regulated by DNA damage-dependent acetylation [49]
and cellular localization [50]. Our results show for the
first time that the interplay between TAp73 and p53 is
dependent on extent of DNA damage and TAp73 levels.
TAp73 can be antiapoptotic by antagonizing p53 when
genotoxic stress is not severe enough to pose danger to
an organism. However, TAp73 accumulation without
concurrent p53 stabilization or in a p53-deficient
background may allow TAp73 to induce p53 target genes
and cell death [51], even though it is a less effective
transactivator than p53. TAp73 also exhibits promoter
selectivity and has a number of unique target genes that
are distinct from those of p53 [52]. Antagonizing p53
by TAp73 in DNA damage response may also explain
why TAp73 is not a classical tumor suppressor. TAp73 is
rarely mutated in human tumors and even overexpressed
in some tumors [45]. p73-deficient mice, including
TAp73-knockout mice, are different from p53-null mice
in both animal development and tumor incidence [9, 12,
53]. TAp73 was previously found to interfere with p53
in regulating telomerase activity [54]. In line with its
pro-survival function, TAp73 has recently been shown
to promote cell growth by activating AP-1 target genes
[55], or through the pentose phosphate pathway [56]. It
is likely that other p53 homologues, such as TAp73β,
ΔNp73, and p63 isoforms, may help to further fine tune
the activities of p53 and p73 in response to different stress
conditions [57].
TAp73 expression is mainly regulated at the
transcriptional level by E2F1 [22]. Upon sub-lethal DNA
damage, E2F1 induction sustains TAp73 expression to
keep the activity of p53 in check (Fig. 7I). Extensive
DNA lesions trigger ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated
E2F1 degradation (Fig. 7I), allowing p53 to fully activate
its target genes and induce apoptosis. Similar to TAp73,
E2F1 has been shown to promote apoptosis in a p53deficient background [58]. The activity of TAp73 can also
be regulated by a number of other proteins. For example,
TAp73 can be phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase c-Abl
during apoptosis induced by cisplatin and other DNA
damaging agents [59, 60]. TAp73 expression can also be
regulated by p53 in response to oxidative stress [61]. A
remaining question is how E2F1 degradation is triggered
in response to lethal DNA damage, and our data suggest
the involvement of ATM (Fig. 7H), which initiates a series
of downstream signaling events following excessive DNA
lesions [16]. E2F1 can also be methylated at lysine 185
by Set9 methyltransferase, which prevents DNA damageinduced E2F1 accumulation and p73 activation [28].
TAp73 and other p53 homologues can be activated
by chemotherapeutic drugs and γ-irradiation, and
implicated as a major determinant of chemotherapy
sensitivity, particularly in p53-deficient tumors [62].
Our data suggest that the influence of TAp73 on p53
in both cancer and normal cells needs to be taken into
consideration in the use of TAp73 as a therapeutic target.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion, our study has uncovered that TAp73 helps
to antagonize the action of p53. In response to high
levels of DNA damage, the depletion of TAp73 through
proteasomal degradation of E2F1 is a prerequisite to
trigger p53-dependent apoptosis to eliminate cells
harboring extensive genomic damage.
