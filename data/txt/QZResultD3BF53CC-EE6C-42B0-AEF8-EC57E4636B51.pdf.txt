Abstract
Cytosine deaminase is used in combination with 5-fluorocytosine as an enzyme-prodrug combination for targeted genetic
cancer treatment. This approach is limited by inefficient gene
delivery and poor prodrug conversion activities. Previously,
we reported individual point mutations within the substrate
binding pocket of bacterial cytosine deaminase (bCD) that
result in marginal improvements in the ability to sensitize
cells to 5-fluorocytosine (5FC). Here, we describe an expanded
random mutagenesis and selection experiment that yielded
enzyme variants, which provide significant improvement in
prodrug sensitization. Three of these mutants were evaluated
using enzyme kinetic analyses and then assayed in three
cancer cell lines for 5FC sensitization, bystander effects, and
formation of 5-fluorouracil metabolites. All variants displayed
18- to 19-fold shifts in substrate preference toward 5FC, a
significant reduction in IC50 values and improved bystander
effect compared with wild-type bCD. In a xenograft tumor
model, the best enzyme mutant was shown to prevent tumor
growth at much lower doses of 5FC than is observed when
tumor cells express wild-type bCD. Crystallographic analyses
of this construct show the basis for improved activity toward
5FC, and also how two different mutagenesis strategies yield
closely related but mutually exclusive mutations that each
result in a significant alteration of enzyme specificity. [Cancer

Introduction
Cytosine deaminase (CD; EC 3.5.4.1) is responsible for the
conversion of cytosine to uracil and ammonia, providing an
important mechanism for pyrimidine salvage in microbes. Because
this activity is not found in mammalian cells (1, 2), CD is being
explored for use in suicide gene therapy (SGT) due to its ability to
also convert the antifungal agent 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) to the
potent antimetabolite, 5-fluorouracil (5FU; refs. 3–6). Intracellularly,
5FU is subsequently metabolized by endogenous enzymes to
5FdUMP, an irreversible inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase, thereby
restricting the production of dTMP and downstream phosphory-

lated products. Depletion of dTTP pools results in inhibition of DNA
synthesis and leads to apoptosis (7–9). A phenomenon known as the
bystander effect provides an extension of cell killing beyond the
cells expressing the suicide gene to neighboring cells (10–13). A
combination of factors is thought to participate in the bystander
effect including transfer of antimetabolites and/or suicide enzymes
through gap junctions, diffusion, and apoptotic vesicles. An
immune-related response also contributes to the bystander effect,
although in a delayed fashion. A potent bystander effect is critical to
successful tumor ablation especially in light of the inefficient viral
and nonviral gene delivery systems currently available. To support
an effective bystander effect, sufficient antimetabolites must be
generated in suicide enzyme-expressing cells.
Unfortunately, wild-type CD displays relatively poor turnover of
5FC, thus limiting the overall therapeutic response. As such, high
doses of 5FC are necessary and result in undesirable side effects
primarily due the presence of microbes in the intestinal tract that
encode CD. The rapid half-life of 5FC in blood serves to further
limit the availability of 5FC at the tumor site. To overcome the
constraints associated with poor 5FC activation, we sought to
optimize the activity of bacterial cytosine deaminase (bCD) toward
5FC using regio-specific random mutagenesis by targeting two key
regions of the active site. From earlier studies, residue D314 in wildtype bCD was shown to play a key role in substrate recognition (14,
15). In particular, the D314G and D314S substitutions display a
shift in substrate preference toward 5FC. However, these variants
provide only a modest 2- to 4-fold decrease in IC50 for 5FC
in vitro compared with wild-type bCD–expressing tumor cells.
Using structural information as well as previous mutagenesis
results, two regions lining the active site of bCD (residues 149–159
and 310–320; Fig. 1) were targeted for random mutagenesis to
identify mutants with further enhanced 5FC sensitivity in vitro and
in vivo (16, 17). Such optimized CD variants that allow lower, less
toxic 5FC doses to achieve efficient cell killing and an enhanced
bystander effect will likely provide meaningful and significant
clinical benefit when used in SGT protocols for the treatment of a
variety of cancers.

Bacterial strains. Escherichia coli strain GIA39, which is deficient in CD
and orotidine 5¶-phosphate decarboxylase activities, was used in the genetic
complementation assays for CD activity (15). The E. coli strains NM522 and
XL1-Blue were used as recipients for certain cloning and mutagenesis
procedures. E. coli BL21 (DE3) and BL21-RIL (Novagen) were used for
protein purification.
Cell lines. Rat C6 glioma cells (C6) were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). Human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT116)
and human prostate carcinoma cells (DU145) were provided by Dr. Neal
Davies (Washington State University, Pullman, WA). Growth conditions for
the cell lines are described in detail by ATCC. Transfected cells were
cultured in media supplemented with blasticidin at 4 Ag/mL (C6 and
DU145) or 6 Ag/mL (HCT116).
Library construction and selection of 5FC active clones. A bCD
expression library encoding variants randomized across residues 149 to 159
was constructed, followed by insertion of randomized sequences spanning
residues 310 to 320 (Supplementary Table S1). Six overlapping oligonucleotides (MB271-MB276) were used to synthesize a 256 bp DNA fragment
including the 11 codons (149–159) that were randomized at 9% mutation
frequency. The codons for the 310 to 320 residues were also randomized at
9%, and the 238 bp DNA fragment was synthesized using the six
oligonucleotides, MB384-MB387, and MB267-MB268. Plasmid DNA purified
from the 149 to 159 mutagenesis selection and the randomized 310 to 320
region fragment were digested with complementary restriction enzymes
and ligated together. Transformation and selection for 5FC active mutants
were performed as described previously using lower 5FC concentrations
(10–0.5 Ag/mL) in plate assays (14, 15).
Enzyme assays. The activity of wild-type and variant bCD lysates was
assayed by monitoring the absorbance change due to the consumption of
cytosine at 286 nm and the production of 5FU at 316 nm using an HP8452A
Diode Array Spectrophotometer (Olis) at room temperature for 10 min
following a protocol adapted from Hayden and colleagues (18). Cleared cell
lysates were prepared as described previously (14). Selected bCDs were
expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and enzymes were purified by Ni-NTA

chromatography and quantified as described (14). The kinetic constants
were determined by plotting initial reaction rates fitted to the MichaelisMenten equation using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software).
Construction of mammalian expression vectors. The wild-type and
mutant codA (encodes bCD) were subcloned as NcoI (blunt-ended)/XhoI
fragments into pCDNA6/myc-HisB (Invitrogen) digested with EcoRV and
XhoI. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to overlay D314S mutation
into pCDNA:1525 using QuikChange mutagenesis according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Stratagene).
In vitro cytotoxicity assays. One microgram of each plasmid DNA was
used to transfect 1  105 C6, HCT116, and DU145 cells by lipofection using
FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) at a 3:1 ratio according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Protein expression level was determined by
immunoblot analysis as previously described (19). For in vitro cytotoxicity
assays, pools of transfectants were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates at
an initial density of 500 (C6) or 1,000 cells per well (HCT116/DU145). After
cell adherence overnight, 5FC (0–30 mmol/L) was added and the cells were
incubated for 6 d, at which time the redox indicator dye Alamar Blue was
added. Cell survival was determined by fluorescence recorded at a 530/590
nm as described by the manufacturer and data were plotted with the SD. At
least three replicates were performed.
In vitro bystander effect assays. C6, HCT116, and DU145 cells stably
transfected with pCDNA were mixed at different ratios with stable
transfectants harboring either pCDNA:bCD, pCDNA:1246, pCDNA:1525, or
pCDNA:1779. The mixed cells were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates
at final density as described above. After cell adherence overnight, 5FC
[4 mmol/L (C6) or 10 mmol/L (HCT116/DU145)] was added and the cells
were incubated for 6 d. Cell viability was determined as described above. At
least three replicates were performed.
High performance liquid chromatography 5FC metabolite analysis.
Stably transfected cells (HCT116) were plated in 6-well dishes (Corning) at a
concentration of 4  104 cells per well. The reaction was stopped at various
hours postdose (2.5 mmol/L 5FC) by adding 200 AL per well of 94:6 (v/v)
acetonitrile/glacial acetic acid and the level of 5FU in cell lysates was

detected using an isocratic, reverse-phase high performance liquid
chromatography method.4 Metabolite separation was carried out on a
Phenomenex Luna C18 (2) analytic column (250 mm  4.6 mm, 5 Am
particle size) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The mobile phase was formic acid
and water (1:99, v/v). 5FU was detected at an UV wavelength of 285 nm and
eluted at 5.8 min. Total metabolite levels were calculated relative to a
known concentration of an internal standard (5-chlorouracil).
Introduction of individual mutations at residues 316 and 317. The
QuikChange kit was used to create amino acid substitutions F316C (MB480481), F316L (MB482-MB483), F316V (MB484-MB485), D317G (MB478MB479) F316C/D317G (MB490-MB491), F316L/D317G (MB492-MB493),
and F316V/D317G (MB494-MB495). After DNA sequence confirmation, the
resulting plasmids were designated pETHT:F316C, pETHT:F316L,
pETHT:F316V, pETHT:D317G, pETHT:F316C/D317G, pETHT:F316L/D317G,
and pETHT:F316V/D317G.
Xenograft tumor model. Pools of HCT116 cells stably transfected
with pCDNA, pCDNA:bCD, or pCDNA:1525 [0.5  106 cells in 200 AL of PBS
(pH 7.2)] were injected s.c. into the flanks of 5 to 6-wk-old female nude mice
(n = 5; BALB/cAnNCr-nu/nu; National Cancer Institute). When tumors
reached 3 to 4 mm (day 0), PBS or 5FC (375 mg/kg) was administered by i.p.
injection twice a day for 21 d. Starting at day 0, the tumor volume was
monitored using caliper measurement every other day, calculated using the
formula: 4/3k [(width  length  height)/2] and analyzed for statistical
significance using Student’s t test.
X-ray crystallography. Three sequential mutations (V152A, F316C,
and D317G) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the wildtype bCD. The expression and purification of the resulting construct
(1525) was carried out as previously described (20). Crystals of 1525 were
grown in sitting drops by vapor phase equilibration against reservoirs
containing 10% to 15% polyethylene glycol 6K, 200 mmol/L MgCl2, and
100 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7–8). Crystals were grown using microseeds of
wild-type enzyme crystals (transferred by streaking drops with a fiber)
and grew within 1 wk to f500 Am in each dimension. Crystals were
cryo-preserved as previously described and found to be isomorphous
with crystals of wild-type enzyme (16). Data were collected on a Rigaku
RAXIS IV++ area detector, using X-rays produced by a Rigaku MicroMax007 HighFlux (HF) microfocus X-ray generator (E = 1.54Å). Data

collection and reduction were performed using the CrystalClear software
package (Rigaku). The structures were refined using the CCP4
crystallographic software suite (21).

Results and Discussion
Many factors limit the overall efficacy of current SGT approaches
for cancer when CD and 5-FC are used. These include rapid
turnover and clearance of 5FC in serum, inefficient gene delivery
such that only a small population of tumor cells expresses the
suicide gene, and poor enzyme activity toward the prodrug coupled
with efficient competition for the enzyme’s active site by the cells’
endogenous pool of cytosine (1, 22–24). As a means to overcome
these obstacles, we sought to create novel CD variants with
significantly improved kinetic preferences toward 5FC. We used
random mutagenesis to introduce multiple amino acid substitutions in two regions lining the active site of bCD and used both
positive and negative selection in E. coli to identify variants with
the ability to confer enhanced 5FC sensitivity to three cancer cell
lines in vitro and in vivo. A similar strategy was used to identify
several Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase mutants with
enhanced tumor ablation capabilities (25, 26). One such variant,
SR39, is currently being used in a phase III clinical trial for prostate
cancer. Although Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase is widely
used, there are two key reasons for optimizing additional suicide
genes: (a) not all cancers are equally responsive to the same drug
and (b) should treatment with one suicide gene fail, alternate
suicide genes that the immune system has not been exposed to
previously, could be used in additional rounds of therapy to ablate
tumors.
Construction of random library and mutant selection.
Previous studies revealed that individual point mutations in the
substrate binding pocket of bCD, which confer sensitivity to E. coli
at 1 Ag/mL 5FC, do not achieve substantial in vitro activity. We
therefore aimed to direct the bCD variants to evolve more
efficiently toward 5FC by heavily randomizing the two regions
lining the active site in a stepwise approach (Fig. 1). A singletargeted library randomized at the 149 to 159 residue region was
initially generated and f590 E. coli that harbored functional CD

were pooled. A second randomized coding region, corresponding
to the incorporation of mutations across residues 310 to 320, was
then introduced and f3,700 enzymatically active variants were
identified from an estimated 1.35  106 total number of
transformants. Of those, 849, 365, 62, 20, and 12 clones conferred
sensitivity at 20, 10, 2, 1, and 0.5 Ag/mL 5FC, respectively. This
lowest 5FC dose is 40-fold lower than the sublethal dose for E. coli
expressing wild-type bCD.
Sequence analysis. Sequences of 47 variants sampled from
each round of screening (data not shown) revealed that all
targeted codons had at least one amino acid substitution. The
average number of substitutions was 2.6, close to the
theoretical average number of 2.1 for 9% randomization.
Sequences of the 12 variants identified at 0.5 Ag/mL 5FC were
somewhat unexpected (Supplementary Table S2) because
substitutions in the 149 to 159 residue region occurred
infrequently and seemed unrelated to the degree of 5FC
activity, and many of the same substitutions were observed in
mutants with less or no 5FC activity. In contrast, the
substitutions at the 310 to 320 residue region showed a strong

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

relationship with 5FC sensitivity: in particular, substitutions at
positions D317 and F316 with smaller hydrophobic residues
were observed for the most active constructs. Few substitutions
were observed at F310, G311, P318, W319, and Y320, suggesting
these sites are important for overall catalytic activity or for
structural stabilization. Sequence analysis reveals that the most
active 12 mutants all have substitutions at D314, F316, and/or
D317. As described in detail below, three mutants (called
constructs 1246, 1525, and 1779) were identified as conferring
sensitivity at significantly lower concentrations of 5FC, and
were chosen for further characterization.
To elucidate the participation of individual amino acid
substitutions at F316 and D317 found in all three constructs
(1246, D314E/F316L/D317G; 1525, V152A/F316C/D317G; 1779,
V315L/F316V/D317G), site-directed mutagenesis was used to
generate the substitutions: F316L, F316C, F316V, D317G, F316L/
D317G, F316C/D317G, and F316V/D317G. Results from E. coli
complementation assays indicate that all mutants display CD
activity, and that the individual D317G substitution and the
double F316C/D317G substitutions found in 1525 seems to be

responsible for conferring the greatest degree of sensitivity
to 5FC.
Enzyme assays of select mutants. To further characterize the
12 mutants identified by growth inhibition on plates containing 0.5
Ag/mL 5FC, cell lysates were used initially to assess cytosine and
5FC conversion levels. Lysates of the mutants 1246, 1525, and 1779
showed the largest 5FC conversions of the variants and the wildtype, whereas the other variants displayed weak or no activity
(data not shown). These three mutants and wild-type bCD were
then purified to near homogeneity using a Ni-NTA chromatography
column and their kinetic constants for cytosine and 5FC
conversion were determined. All three random mutants display
reduced kinetic parameters toward cytosine (Table 1). Mutant K m
values are increased 3.7- to 10.7-fold relative to wild-type bCD and

kcat values for the mutants range from 16.6- to 29-fold lower,
corresponding to a 82.2- to 305.4-fold reduction in catalytic
efficiency (kcat/K m). When 5FC is used as the substrate, K m values
are modestly increased 1.8 to 3.3-fold and kcat values are increased
4.3- to 5.9-fold, to yield an overall improvement in kcat/K m for 5FC
of 1.5- to 2.9-fold compared with wild-type bCD. The combination
of reduced activity toward cytosine, and increased kcat for 5FC,
results in a significant (18.2- to 19.2-fold) shift in the relative
substrate specificity toward 5FC relative to wild-type bCD.
In vitro analysis of mutant bCDs. Mutant and wild-type codA
genes were cloned into the expression vector, pCDNA, and used to
stably transfect C6, HCT116, and DU145 cell lines. Results from
prodrug sensitivity assays show that all three variant bCD
constructs confer increased sensitivity to 5FC, albeit to varying

degrees in the different cell lines (Fig. 2A). In C6 transfectants, only
a modest reduction in IC50 was observed compared with wild-type
bCD–transfected cells (1.3- to 2.7-fold). The IC50 values of mutant
bCD-transfected DU145 cells were 2.1- to 5-fold lower than wildtype bCD–transfectants. The mutants displayed the greatest
reduction in IC50 values in HCT116 transfectants at 2.4 to 17-fold
lower values than bCD. In all cell lines examined, 1525 consistently
displayed the lowest IC50 values of the three mutants with the best

variance in the degree of 5FC sensitivity. Clinical studies indicate

simply be a reflection of inherent variations in drug sensitivity
exhibited by individual cell types. Previously, we reported the
construction and characterization of single site mutations at
residue 314 (D314; ref. 14). Here, we sought to compare these D314
variants (D314G, D314A, and D314S) to the randomly derived
mutants (1246, 1525, and 1779) and to explore the possibility that
combinations of the best mutants from both series would yield an
additive effect. Initially D314G, D314A, and D314S and wild-type
bCD–transfected HCT116 cells were evaluated for 5FC sensitivity
(Fig. 2B). Of the three D314 substitutions, D314S displays the
greatest response to 5FC with an IC50 f3.4-fold lower than that of
wild-type bCD and f5-fold higher than 1525-transfected cells. To
assess the effect of the combination mutant, cells transfected with
pCDNA, pCDNA:bCD, pCDNA:1525, pCDNA:D314S, and
pCDNA:1525/D314S were subjected to in vitro 5FC sensitivity
assays as described above. Results from this comparison indicate
that the 1525/D314S overlay does not yield an increase in 5FC
sensitivity over 1525 or the individual D314S mutant or wild-type
bCD–transfected cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, the mutational routes
toward optimal 5FC activation, generated by site-directed or
randomizing mutagenesis, yield mutually exclusive sets of mutations that do not act synergistically. Below, we provide a possible
explanation for this lack of additive response based on details that
emerged from 1525 structure determinations.
Bystander effect. The three key mutants were further
characterized for their ability to influence the killing of
non-bCD–expressing cells through the bystander effect. Towards
that end, populations of vector and bCD-transfected cells were
mixed at various ratios and subjected to either 4 mmol/L (C6) or 10
mmol/L (HCT116 and DU145) 5FC for 6 days. The percentage of
bCD-expressing cells needed to achieve 50% cell killing ranges from
20% to 50%, 20% to 60%, and 10% to 80% for C6, DU145, and
HCT116 cells, respectively, when mutant bCDs were examined
(Fig. 3A–C). In contrast, mixed populations containing wild-type
bCD–transfectants displayed no cell killing effect in HCT116 cells
and slight to modest effects in DU145 and C6 cells, respectively, and
were unable to achieve 50% cell killing in any of the cell lines
tested. Mutant 1525 displayed the greatest bystander effect in every
cell line examined. In HCT116 cells this is most evident; when only
10% of 1525-expressing cells are present, 50% of the population is
killed at a 5FC concentration at which 100% wild-type bCD
population remains fully viable.
High performance liquid chromatography analysis of 5FU
metabolites. Low transfection efficiencies in SGT impose a
reliance on a robust bystander effect for tumor ablation. Although
results from our kinetic studies suggest an improvement in 5FC
deamination activity, we sought to more directly assess the
production of 5FU by bCD-transfected cells by high performance
liquid chromatography. Starting on day 3, the level of 5FU begins to
accumulate in lysates from 1525-transfected cells and continues
to increase from f100 Ag/mL at day 3 to f400 Ag/mL on day 7
(last time point) and reflects a 35.8-fold difference in 5FU levels
between 1525 and wild-type bCD (Fig. 3D). This is in contrast to
vector and bCD-transfected cell lysates that show no significant
change in 5FU levels over the time course. Bystander experiments
with 5FC revealed that all three variant bCDs showed a more
robust cell killing in all three transfected cell lines compared with
wild-type bCD–transfected cells. We suggest this is a direct
reflection of the amount of 5FU produced in the transfected cells.
In vivo xenograft tumor model. Mutant 1525 shows the best
cell killing and bystander effect in vitro and was selected for further

analysis in an in vivo xenograft tumor model for human colorectal
cancer. Tumor growth in all groups treated with PBS was
indistinguishable with the exception of later points (Fig. 4). This
statistically insignificant difference in the tumor volume near the
end of the time course is likely due to the amorphous nature of the
large tumors that made it difficult to obtain consistent measurements. Although no difference in tumor volume was observed
between mice bearing vector or wild-type bCD tumors throughout
or after the 5FC treatment period, the lack of significant tumor
growth observed in mice bearing 1525 tumors is in stark contrast.
From the time 5FC administration began to the maximum size,
wild-type bCD tumors increased in volume from 34.4 to 1154 mm3
(30.8-fold), whereas the 1525 tumors increased only from 32.5 mm3
to maximum of 185 mm3 (5.7-fold). Other studies using wild-type
bCD show a reduced tumor growth rate using comparable doses of
5FC (28–30). In our hands, no significant antitumor response with
wild-type bCD is observed at 375 mg/kg twice a day, whereas this
dose provides a substantial growth restriction in 1525-bearing
tumors. As such, 1525 provides significant improvement in tumor
growth inhibition using a 5FC dose at which wild-type bCD tumors
is completely unresponsive to.
Crystallographic analysis of bCD 1525. Crystals containing the
enzyme in complex with the mechanism-based inhibitors 4-(R)-

hydroxyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidine (DHP) or 5-fluoro-4-(S)-hydroxyl3,4-dihydropyrimidine (5F-DHP) were generated out by soaking
crystals in buffer containing 10 mmol/L 2-hydroxypyrimidine or
5-fluoro-2-hydroxypyrimidine (Aldrich), respectively. In these
experiments, the pyrimidine compounds are converted enzymatically to a tightly bound hydrated adduct that mimics the enzyme
transition state. The statistics for data collection and refinement
are summarized in Supplementary Table S3.
Unbiased Fourier difference (Fobs-Fcalc) maps were calculated
using diffraction data of 1525 soaked in DHP and 5F-DHP (Fig. 5A),
respectively, using the phase information calculated from a protein
model consisting of the wild-type bCD enzyme (PDB accession
code 1K70) with residues 152, 316, and 317 changed to alanine and
the bound ligand DHP removed. The density of the bound
compounds clearly showed the presence of bound compounds in
positions nearly identical to those observed in the wild-type
enzyme. The orientation of the pyrimidine ring within the density
maps is confirmed by the presence of additional density in the 5FDHP complex, corresponding to the additional fluorine substituent.
However, compared with the wild-type enzyme, the compounds
seem to exhibit significant conformational heterogeneity in the
active site, particularly evident as disorder and minimal density at
the C1 carbon position of both compounds. As a result, coordinates

analogue 2-hydroxypyrimidine (or DHP; left) and
5F-DHP (right ) bound in the active site of bCD. As
noted in the text, the density for the bound compound
indicates disorder, particularly near the C1 carbon.
However, the appearance of additional difference
density corresponding to the 5-fluoro substituent
(arrow ) unambiguously confirms the orientation of the
inhibitor. B, comparison of the active sites of wild-type
and mutant bCD enzymes. Superposition of the active

5F-DHP (PDB accession code-1RA5) versus 1525
soaked with 5F-DHP. The motion of residue D314
(arrow ), into the cavity vacated by removal of a side
chain in the D317G mutation, mimics the structural
effect of the previously described D314A and D314G
mutations.

of the bound compounds were not included in the final refined
models of 1525. These structural models, along with the X-ray
diffraction amplitudes, have been deposited in the RCSB structural
database (accession code 3G77) to allow independent calculation
of difference maps by interested investigators.
In the previously described structure of D314A mutant, the
D314A substitution creates a hydrophobic pocket to accommodate
the fluorine atom of 5F-DHP (16). This mutation not only
eliminates a spatial clash with the fluorine atoms but also provides
a favorable van der Waals contact with the bound 5F-DHP. In
contrast, none of the three side chains mutated in the active site of
1525 are in direct contact with bound substrate. However, as a
result of the mutation of D317 (which eliminates a carboxylate side
chain), the wild-type residue D314, which is the side chain nearest
to the 5¶-position of the substrate, swings away from the active site
(Fig. 5B), creating a neighboring cavity and reducing the local
negative charge. This movement produces a similar chemical and
structural effect as observed in D314A mutant.
Two other mutations (V152A and F316C) do not seem to affect
the active site directly. This is further supported by experiments
in which the substitutions found at F316 and D317 in 1246, 1525,
and 1779 were individually examined for the ability to confer 5FC
sensitivity in complementation assays. Close examination of the
sequences at position D314 and D317 of the 12 bCD variants
identified from the genetic complementation studies reveals
D317G substitutions (but no D314A, S, or G substitutions) in nine
of the isolates, whereas the remaining three clones have A or G
substitutions at D314 but none at D317. Combining 1525 (V152A/
F316C/D31G) and D314S substitutions resulted in a reversal of 5FC
sensitivity rather than an additive effect. Taken together, these
results support the notion that enhancement of 5FC activity occurs
when mutations exist at D314 or the D317G substitution is present
but that these substitutions are mutually exclusive.
Cancer chemotherapy treatments can result in significant and
often debilitating side effects due to the absence of distinct
biochemical differences that occur between normal and neoplastic
cells. SGT provides an exceptional opportunity to introduce unique

biochemical characteristics to cancer cells that can then be
exploited for a safer, less toxic, and more effective treatment. Two
suicide gene/prodrug systems have garnered significant attention
and are undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluations; the widely
used Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir and the
CD/5FC systems (29). Despite initial enthusiasm for the use of
these suicide gene/prodrug approaches, limitations such as
insufficient gene delivery to the tumor site and poor prodrug
conversion properties of the suicide enzymes have restricted the
full potential of SGT. From over a million bCD mutants, we have
identified one bCD variant (1525) that displays superior 5FC
kinetic, cell killing, bystander, and tumor growth restriction
activities. Collaborative studies using adenoviral vectors expressing
mutant D314A in combination with radiotherapy to treat
pancreatic cancer suggested that even the slight improvement
of D314A provided enhancement of 5FC-mediated cytotoxicity
in vitro and in vivo (31). Therefore, mutant 1525 will likely provide a
significant advantage over wild-type bCD or D314A in at least three
important ways: (a) by enhancing 5FC-mediated cell killing
through both direct and bystander mechanisms; (b) by allowing
the use of lower, less debilitating doses of 5FC to achieve effective
cell killing; and (c) by providing an optimized alternative to the use
of wild-type CD or Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase SGT
approaches. Furthermore, mutant 1525 may be used in a variety of
different applications including for restenosis, noninvasive tumor
imaging, and in negative selection systems.
