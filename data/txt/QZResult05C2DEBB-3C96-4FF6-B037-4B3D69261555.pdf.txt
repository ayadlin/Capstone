BACKGROUND: This study examined the influence of prior treatment on the course of cognitive functioning in breast
cancer survivors. Changes in cognitive functioning over time were compared in breast cancer survivors treated with
chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, breast cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy only, and women with no history
of cancer. METHODS: Stage 0-II breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (CT group; n ¼
62) or radiotherapy only (RT group; n ¼ 67) completed neuropsychological assessments 6 months after completing
treatment and again 36 months later. Women with no history of cancer (NC group; n ¼ 184) were assessed over a
similar interval. RESULTS: A significant group  time effect was found for processing speed (P ¼ .009) that reflected
a tendency for the NC group but not the RT and CT groups to improve over time. There was also a significant group
effect for executive functioning (P ¼ .006) that reflected the NC group performing better than the CT and RT groups.
Additional analyses found the administration of hormonal therapy was not associated with change over time in cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide limited support for the view that changes in cognitive functioning in cancer survivors are attributable to chemotherapy administration and illustrate the importance of including a
radiotherapy comparison group. Future research should seek to examine possible mechanisms that could explain the
apparent prolonged impact of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy on cognitive functioning in breast cancer surviC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
As survivors of breast cancer are living longer post-treatment, there is an increasing need to understand the long-term
effects of adjuvant therapies. Numerous studies have examined the effects of cancer treatments on cognitive functioning
among breast cancer survivors. Results of meta-analyses suggest adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with cognitive problems as measured by standardized neuropsychological tests.1,2 However, most of the studies included in these analyses
have been cross-sectional. Therefore, they do not provide information about changes over time in cognitive functioning
among breast cancer survivors. Longitudinal studies are necessary to understand the course of post-treatment cognitive
performance through survivorship. Of particular importance are studies that follow patients for extended periods of time
after treatment completion.
Two longitudinal studies can be identified that followed breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy for at least
18 months after treatment completion, with assessments conducted at standardized time points. Ahles and colleagues3
evaluated cognitive functioning in breast cancer patients before the start of chemotherapy and again at 1, 6, and 18 months
post-treatment. These patients were compared with breast cancer patients who did not receive chemotherapy and women
without cancer assessed at matched intervals. There was a significant group by time interaction for measures of verbal ability (P ¼ .01) showing that patients who did not receive chemotherapy and women without cancer demonstrated improved
performance across time, whereas patients treated with chemotherapy did not demonstrate improved performance until

6 months post-treatment. Additional analyses found that
those in the no chemotherapy group who were prescribed
tamoxifen performed worse on measures of processing
speed (P ¼ .016), verbal memory (P ¼ .018), and verbal
ability (P ¼ .023) compared with the noncancer group.
Mar Fan and colleagues4 assessed patients toward the end
of chemotherapy (ie, after at least 3 cycles) and at 1-year
and 2-year follow-ups and compared their performances
to those of women without cancer. At the 2-year followup, the chemotherapy-treated patients performed worse
on a measure of executive functioning than the women
without cancer (P ¼ .048). No differences were found
based on whether the chemotherapy-treated patients
received hormonal therapy.
The studies described above do not yield a consistent
picture of the long-term course of cognitive functioning
among breast cancer survivors. Furthermore, neither
examined cognitive performance beyond 2 years posttreatment. The current study addresses these limitations
by comparing changes in cognitive functioning over a 3year period after treatment completion in 2 groups of
patients (those who received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy and those who received radiotherapy without
chemotherapy) and a comparable interval for women
with no history of cancer. The aim was to determine
whether there are differences in change over time in cognition among women who received chemotherapy plus
radiotherapy (CT), radiotherapy without chemotherapy
(RT), and noncancer controls (NC). We previously
reported the results of cross-sectional comparisons conducted 6 months after treatment completion.5,6 Findings
showed that chemotherapy-treated patients performed
worse than noncancer controls on measures of nonverbal
memory and executive functioning.6 In addition, radiotherapy-treated patients performed worse than noncancer
controls on measures of attention and executive functioning.6 Comparisons were not made between those treated
with chemotherapy versus radiotherapy. Additional findings indicated there were no differences in cognitive functioning based on whether patients were receiving
tamoxifen.6 In light of these and other findings,3,4 we
hypothesized that women who received chemotherapy
would demonstrate worse cognitive functioning over a
36-month post-treatment follow-up period than women
with no history of cancer. In light of our previous finding6
and inconsistent findings in the literature,3,4,7 no
hypotheses were offered about differences in cognitive
functioning in radiotherapy-treated patients relative
to chemotherapy-treated patients and noncancer

participants. The current study also explored the possibility that hormone therapy in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy might be associated with
changes in cognitive functioning over time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedures
Data for the current report were drawn from a larger study
of quality of life in women being treated for early stage
breast cancer at the Moffitt Cancer Center and the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center.8 Patient
eligibility criteria for the larger study were: diagnosed with
stage 0-II breast cancer; scheduled to receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy; no other history of cancer besides basal cell skin carcinoma; no prior history of chemotherapy
or radiotherapy; and no conditions in which fatigue is a
prominent symptom (eg, acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia). Additional
eligibility criteria for the current report were that the
patients completed the cognitive assessments and had no
recurrent breast cancer or new primary cancer. This study
was approved by the University of South Florida and
University of Kentucky institutional review boards, and
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Each patient who enrolled in the study (described
below) was matched with a noncancer control (as
described in detail elsewhere).8 Noncancer participants
were women who were within 5 years of age and resided
in the same Zip Code as their patient match. Additional
eligibility criteria for the noncancer controls were: no history of cancer (besides basal cell skin carcinoma) or other
potentially life-threatening diseases; and no conditions in
which fatigue is a prominent symptom (as described
above). Cognitive performance was assessed approximately 6 months after completion of radiotherapy (T1)
and approximately 36 months later (T2), with noncancer
participants assessed at comparable time intervals.
T1 cognitive assessments were completed by 449
participants (CT ¼ 96, RT ¼ 113, NC ¼ 240). At T2,
133 participants declined participation or could not be
contacted (CT ¼ 33, RT ¼ 44, NC ¼ 56), and 3 were
ineligible for T2 because of a recurrence (RT ¼ 1) or second breast cancer diagnosis (CT ¼ 1, RT ¼ 1). Thus, this
report is based on 313 participants (CT ¼ 62, RT ¼ 67,
NC ¼ 184) who had cognitive data at both T1 and T2.
Demographic characteristics and T1 cognitive domain scores (described below) of the 133 participants who
withdrew or could not be contacted were compared with

the 313 participants who completed T1 and T2. Among
patients, the 129 patients with complete data had more
years of education than the 77 patients who did not complete both assessments (P < .001). Also, patients who
completed both assessments performed better on the
verbal memory domain at T1 than those who did not
complete both assessments (P ¼ .011). There were no significant (P > .05) differences between the 56 controls
who did not complete both assessments and the 184 controls who completed both assessments on any demographic variables. Controls who did not complete both
assessments performed better at T1 on the attention cognitive domain than those with complete data (P ¼ .041).

gence (factor g) as measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-Revised.9
Attention.

This domain was comprised of 3 tests. For trial 1 of
the Color Trails Test,10 participants are required to connect colored targets in numerical order as quickly as possible. For the Digit Span subtest of the WAIS-III,11
participants are read a list of an increasingly long series of
number and asked to repeat the numbers. Next, the examiner reads sequences of numbers and the participant is
required to repeat them in reverse order. The Spatial Span
subtest of the WAIS-III11 is a visual analog of the Digit
Span test.

Measures
Demographic and clinical data

Demographic data were obtained through use of a
standard self-report questionnaire. Variables assessed
included age, menopausal status, race, marital status, annual household income, and educational level. Medical
charts of patients were reviewed at the completion of
study participation to obtain information about disease
and treatment characteristics. Variables assessed included
disease stage, type of breast surgery, and use of hormonal
therapy at T1. Number of chemotherapy cycles and
chemotherapy regimen (CT group) and number of radiation treatments and cumulative radiation doses were also
recorded.
Cognitive performance

Cognitive performance was assessed using a battery
of neuropsychological tests administered by doctoral students in psychology trained to conduct these evaluations.
Tests were selected based on their reliability and validity,
and the availability of published norms for each measure.
Raw test scores were converted to standardized t scores
(mean ¼ 50, standard deviation ¼ 10) based on published
normative data. In addition to overall intellectual ability,
5 domains of cognitive functioning were assessed: verbal
memory, attention, executive functioning, processing
speed, and nonverbal memory.
Overall intellectual ability.

The National Adult Reading Test (NART)9 was
used to estimate overall intellectual ability. The NART
contains 50 irregular words that cannot be easily decoded
phonetically. Previous work has shown that performance
on the NART is highly correlated with general intelli-

Executive functioning.

This domain was comprised of 3 tests. For the Digit
Symbol Coding subtest of the WAIS III,11 participants
are required to match numbers with geometric symbols
according to a specific key code in a speeded fashion. For
trial 2 of the Color Trails Test,10 participants are required
to connect colored number targets in numerical order in
an alternating color as quickly as possible. For the Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWAT),12 participants are required to produce words beginning with a
target letter over a series of three 1-minute trials.
Nonverbal memory.

This domain was comprised of 3 measures from the
Visual Reproduction test of the Wechsler Memory ScalesIII. In this test, cards with 5 novel geometric designs are
presented 1 at a time for 10 seconds. Participants are then
required to draw from memory the design they were just
shown (immediate free recall). Delayed free recall and recognition recall were also measured after a 30-minute
delay.
Processing speed.

This domain was comprised of 2 measures from the
Ruff 2 & 7 Test,13 which requires participants to read
through 20 trials of numbers and letters and to mark
through all occurrences of the numbers 2 and 7. Scores
were derived for total speed and total accuracy in completing this task.
Verbal memory.

This domain was comprised of 3 subtests of the
California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT).14 The CVLT
consists of 5 learning trials of a 16-word list. Participants

words from the list as they can remember. After a 20-minute delay during which the participant is engaged in
nonverbal tasks, the participant is asked to recall the list.
The immediate recall, long-delayed recall, and recognition scores were included in this domain.

Statistical Analyses
To examine longitudinal changes in cognitive performance across the 2 time points, repeated measures analyses
of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted using SAS version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The initial analysis consisted of a 3 (group: NC, RT, CT) by 2 (time: time 1,
time 2) ANOVA for each cognitive domain in which the
cognitive domain score represented the mean of the measures for that domain. Of principal interest was the group
 time interaction effect, which assesses whether the
groups changed at comparable rates over the follow-up
period. If a group  time interaction was not significant,
the corresponding group effect was examined.
Additional analyses were undertaken to determine
whether prescription of hormonal therapy to patients at
T1 was related to changes in cognitive performance. NC
participants were removed from this analysis. For each of
the cognitive domains, the interaction among hormone
therapy (prescribed vs not prescribed), group (RT vs CT),
and time (T1 vs T2) was evaluated.

1928

A significance level of .01 (2-tailed) was used as the
criterion for statistical significance for the group  time
interactions and group effects. A .05 significance level (2tailed) was the criterion for subsequent analyses in the case
of significant group  time interaction or group effect.
The sample size of 313 participants and P value of .01
allowed .80 power to detect a group  time interaction of
d ¼ 0.29 and a group effect of d ¼ 0.44, small to medium-sized effects.

RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
Because only 8 patients received chemotherapy in the absence of radiotherapy, those participants were excluded
from the current analysis. Demographic characteristics of
all participants are listed in Table 1. The CT group was
younger than the RT and NC groups (P < .001), and the
2 patient groups had higher T1 NART scores than the
NC group (P ¼ .007). There were also differences in the
T1 and T2 intervals, with the RT group having a longer
interval than the CT or NC groups (P ¼ .013). Thus, age,
T1 NART scores, and time between assessments were
used as covariates in all analyses.
Clinical characteristics of the RT and CT groups are
presented in Table 2. The CT group was more likely to
have undergone mastectomy, to have more advanced disease, and to have a longer duration from cancer diagnosis

therapy for any of the cognitive domains (P > .01). When

DISCUSSION
Findings provided limited support for the hypothesis that
women treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer would
demonstrate worse cognitive functioning over a 36-month
post-treatment follow-up period relative to women with no
history of cancer. For the processing speed domain, change
in cognitive functioning varied as a function of group in
the expected direction. Specifically, there was a trend toward performance improving over time in the NC group
but not in the CT group. This pattern suggests that a practice effect (ie, improved performance because of prior test
exposure) did not occur in women treated with chemotherapy. For the executive functioning domain, there was a
main effect for treatment group, indicating the CT group
performed worse than the NC group.
These findings are partially consistent with prior
research. Although 1 longitudinal study found no differences between breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and noncancer participants 1 year post-treatment,15
other studies that assessed patients 6 months or longer
post-treatment have observed differences in cognitive
functioning between these 2 groups.3,4,16 Specifically,
chemotherapy-treated patients performed worse than
noncancer controls in the domains of processing speed,3
executive functioning,4,16 and verbal ability.3 Although
the current study did not include a verbal ability domain,
a test of verbal fluency (ie, COWAT) was included in the
executive functioning domain, for which a group effect
was observed. Together, these results suggest that processing speed (the ability to quickly perform automatic cognitive tasks while under pressure to maintain concentration)
and executive functioning (the ability to shift cognitive
sets and solve novel problems) may be the domains most
affected by chemotherapy.
Hypotheses were not offered about the performance
of women who received radiotherapy without chemotherapy relative to the other 2 groups. Interestingly, results for
the RT group were similar to those for the CT group.
Regarding processing speed, NC participants improved
over time, whereas RT patients, like CT patients, demonstrated no change. Regarding executive functioning, the
NC participants performed better than RT patients as
well as CT patients. In no instance did results show significant differences in performance between RT patients and
Cancer

Cognition After Cancer Treatment/Phillips et al

CT patients. However, the study may not have been sufficiently powered to detect differences between the 2
patient groups.
These findings are also partially consistent with
prior research. A longitudinal study that assessed cognitive
functioning over the 6 months after treatment completion
found no differences in rates of cognitive decline between
breast patients who received chemotherapy and those who
received radiotherapy only.16 In another study, breast cancer patients who received either chemotherapy followed
by radiotherapy or radiotherapy only were assessed before
radiotherapy and 1 year post-treatment.17 Before radiotherapy, rates of cognitive impairment were only marginally higher in the chemotherapy-treated patients (34% vs
24%, P ¼ .06). One year after radiotherapy, differences
among these patients were even less evident (19% vs 13%,
P ¼ .1). These results are consistent with our findings of
no significant differences in cognitive functioning
between the CT and RT groups.
The finding in the present study that the addition of
hormone therapy was not related to cognitive performance is consistent with our prior research6 and results of a
study in which women with breast cancer were followed
for 2 years after treatment completion.4 However, other
studies have reported findings suggesting a negative
impact of hormone therapy on cognitive functioning,
especially in the processing speed3,18 and verbal memory3,18,19 domains. Some of these studies examined the
effects of hormone therapy among women who received
chemotherapy,18,19 whereas others examined the effects of
hormone therapy only among women who did not receive
chemotherapy.3 It may be that tamoxifen in particular is
associated with lower cognitive functioning,20 although
this was not the case in the current study. Differences in
designs and treatment groups across studies seriously limit
the conclusions that can be drawn regarding how hormone therapy may interact with chemotherapy or radiotherapy to affect cognitive functioning.
Strengths of the current study include the inclusion
of both radiotherapy and noncancer comparison groups, a
3-year follow-up period, and the relatively large sample
size. Limitations include the homogeneity of the sample
(mostly white, well-educated participants) and the lack of
a pretreatment cognitive assessment. With patients
assessed at only 2 time points post-treatment, acute versus
late onset of cognitive dysfunction could not be evaluated,
as has been done in prior research.21 In addition, patients
who did not complete the second assessment had less
education and worse performances on verbal memory at

Cancer

T1 compared with patients who completed both assessments, and noncancer participants who did not complete
the second assessment had better performances on attention at T1. Thus, the education, verbal memory, and
attention levels of the final sample did not reflect the
larger group that completed the initial assessment. It is
possible that the patients who were most vulnerable to
cognitive dysfunction may not have completed the T2
assessment, suggesting results may be conservative estimates of the effects of cancer treatment on changes in cognitive functioning. Additional limitations include that
many women had already been prescribed hormone therapy at T1, which limits the interpretation of the effects of
hormone therapy on cognitive functioning over time.
Also, data were not available regarding how many women
receiving chemotherapy experienced premature menopause, which may be associated with changes in cognitive
functioning.22 Finally, a limitation of using neuropsychological assessments is that it is not immediately clear how
impairments may affect what an individual can and cannot do in everyday life. To better understand this, future
investigators may consider using more ecological measures of cognitive functioning.
Results of the current study highlight the importance of including a radiotherapy comparison group.
Interestingly, when cognitive functioning was worse in
the CT group, differences were consistently noted with
the NC group and not the RT group. Moreover, the RT
group demonstrated worse cognitive performance than
the NC group in many of the same domains as the CT
group. Were the RT group not included in the current
study, one might have concluded that worse performance
in the processing speed and executive functioning
domains was specific to chemotherapy administration.
Because differences relative to the NC group were evident
for both the RT and CT groups, the question arises as to
what is driving these findings. Future research should
investigate potential mechanisms such as residual symptoms (eg, pain23 and fatigue8) and persistent cytokine dysregulation24 that may be present in both chemotherapytreated and radiotherapy-treated patients.
Findings of this study have important clinical implications. When educating patients about the longer-term
impact of treatment on cognitive functioning, health care
providers may wish to communicate that such effects may
result from radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.
Although effects may persist for years after treatment and
may possibly intensify, they tend to be domain specific
rather than global. Patients who report that cognitive

problems are interfering with their daily activities should
receive a workup that includes referral to a neuropsychologist who can conduct a systematic evaluation of their cognitive functioning and provide recommendations to
address any problems that might be identified.
