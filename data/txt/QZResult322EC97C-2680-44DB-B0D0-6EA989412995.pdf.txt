ABSTRACT
PRIMA-1met (APR-246) is a methylated derivative and structural analog of
PRIMA-1 (p53 re-activation and induction of massive apoptosis). PRIMA-1met has
been reported to restore both the wild type (wt) structure and function of mutant
p53. Here, we show that PRIMA-1met is highly effective at limiting the growth of CRC
cells regardless of p53 status. However, PRIMA-1met induces robust apoptosis only in
CRC cells with mutant p53. Upregulation of Noxa, a proapoptotic molecule, is crucial
for PRIMA-1met mediated activity. In human xenograft model of disease, PRIMA-1met
effectively suppresses CRC tumor growth. Our results uncover distinct mechanisms of
PRIMA-1met in CRC with different p53 status, thus providing a mechanistic rationale to
evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRIMA-1met in CRC patients with different p53 status.

and induction of massive apoptosis-1), a low molecular
weight compound (C9H15NO3), was discovered to restore
the mutant p53 to the structure and function of wild-type
p53, thus selectively killing cancer cells with mutant
p53 [17]. PRIMA-1met (APR-246), a methylated and
more potent analog of PRIMA-1, has already advanced
to a phase I/II clinic trial in hematologic malignancies
and prostate cancer [18, 19]. It has been reported that
PRIMA-1/PRIMA-1met selectively restores the sequencespecific DNA binding region of mutated p53 via forming
adducts with thiols and recovers its normal wild-type
function to induce apoptosis in cancer cells [17, 20, 21].
However, some recent studies discovered that PRIMA-1/
PRIMA-1met also has inhibitory effect on cancer cells
without p53 mutation [20, 22–25].
In this study, we aim to screen the effect of
PRIMA-1met on different CRC cell lines, in order to gain
a deep and comprehensive understanding for the potential
of PRIMA-1met as an anti-cancer agent especially for
CRC patients. We demonstrated that PRIMA-1met

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease
with progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic
aberrations and defects in immune surveillance [1–3].
Activation of oncogenes and inactivation/loss of tumor
suppressor genes (TSGs) are crucial for transformation
of malignant cells [4, 5]. p53, as a stress-inducible
transcription factor, regulates a diversity of biological
functions, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
senescence, and autophagy, via mediating its plethora
of target genes [6–8]. In CRC, p53 mutation occurs in
about 40–50% of cases [9–11]. Mutated p53 loses its
tumor suppressive function, which is a critical event
in the adenoma to carcinoma transition during colon
carcinogenesis [12]. Scientists have been enthusiastic
in developing different strategies to reactivate mutated
p53 in cancer cells as an anti-cancer therapy [13, 14].
So far, a variety of compounds has been investigated to
target mutant p53 [15, 16]. PRIMA-1 (p53-reactivation

PRIMA-1met induced robust apoptosis preferably in p53
mutant CRC cell lines, which was mediated through
upregulated expression of pro-apoptotic Noxa. In
addition, PRIMA-1met also exerted effects on inhibition
of proliferation, migration and colony formation in a
p53-independent manner. PRIMA-1met impeded CRC
tumor progression in xenograft mouse model.

wild-type p53 (HCT116wt, RKO), 2 cell lines with
mutant p53 (DLD-1, Caco2), and 1 cell line knocked out
p53 (HCT116ko). As shown in Figure 2A, PRIMA-1met
treatment induced apoptosis in two CRC cell lines
carrying mutant p53, and showed a dose-dependent
effect in DLD-1 cell line (Figure 2B). Interestingly,
PRIMA-1met treatment also induced moderate apoptotic
response in HCT116wt, in contrast, another p53 wildtype cell line RKO and p53-null HCT116 appeared
to be resistant to PRIAM-1met treatment (Figure 2A).
Western blotting analysis revealed an increase of
PARP cleavage in DLD-1 and HCT116wt cell lines
(Figure 2C). In agreement with the results from
apoptosis assays by FACS analysis, an increase of
PARP cleavage was not observed in p53-null HCT116
cells after PRIAM-1met treatment (Figure 2C). Apoptotic
induction of PRIMA-1met was not only p53 dependent,
but also related to p53 activation, because high
expression of phospho-p53 (Ser15) could be detected
after PRIMA-1met treatment (Figure 2D). These results
suggest that, in general, PRIMA-1met induced-apoptosis
is more prominent in CRC cells with mutant p53.

RESULTS
PRIMA-1met inhibited CRC cell proliferation in a
dose-dependent manner
We first investigated the effects of PRIMA-1met on
the growth of 10 human CRC cell lines with different
p53 status. The results from the CTG assay showed
a gradual decrease in cell proliferation along with
progressive increases in the concentrations of PRIMA1met for 48 hours (Table 1 and Figure 1A and 1B). The IC50
and p53 status of these CRC cell lines were summarized
in Table1. The inhibitory effect on cell growth induced
by PRIMA-1met was in a dose-dependent manner in all
CRC cell lines. However, HT29 cell line exhibited more
resistance to PRIMA-1met than the others (Figure 1A). The
means of IC50 in p53wt CRC cell lines, p53mt CRC cell
lines, and p53ko CRC cell lines were 24.90 μM (ranging
from 7.5 to 45.9 μM), 28.23 μM (ranging from 10.9 to
58.6 μM) and 23.70 μM, respectively. Surprisingly, we
did not observe significant difference in the IC50 values
among the 3 groups of cell lines with distinct p53 status
(Figure 1B, p > 0.05).

PRIMA-1met increased expression of Noxa, but
not PUMA
Under cellular stress, wild type (wt) p53
up-regulates its target proteins to promote
apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2)
family members, such as Noxa and PUMA, are
important target proteins [25, 31]. We performed
western blotting analysis and qRT-PCR to evaluate
expression of Noxa and PUMA. Cells were treated
with PRIAM-1met that resulted in strong expression of
Noxa in p53 mutant DLD-1 and SW620 cell lines and
p53 wild-type HCT-116 cell line (Figure 3A and 3B).
However, the highest fold increase of expression of
Noxa mRNA in DLD-1 cell line occurred concomitantly
with the largest percentage of apoptosis observed in

not induce expression of another pro-apoptotic gene,
PUMA, on either RNA level or protein level (Figure 3C
and 3D). Taken together, these data indicated that Noxa
played a pivotal role in the activity of PRIMA-1met.

blotting analysis confirmed the reduced Noxa proten
level upon Noxa specific siRNA treatment in these
3 cell lines (inserted pictures in Figure 4A, 4B and 4C).
We observed that the inhibitory effect on two mutant
p53 cell lines, DLD-1 and SW480, were significantly
reduced after knocking down Noxa, whereas knocking
down Noxa in wt p53 HCT1116 failed to produce
any noticeable impact on the IC50 (Figure 4A, 4B, 4C
and 4D).

To explore the effect of PRIMA-1met on the

relative to DMSO treated controls, wound healing was
significantly impaired in HCT116wt and DLD-1 cells

treated with PRIMA-1met. These findings strongly suggest
that PRIMA-1met inhibits motility signalling in CRC
cells. Morphological transformation of cell colonies
in vitro has a high correlation with carcinogenesis
in vivo. We conducted soft agar assay to assess the
impact of PRIMA-1met on colony formation of CRC
cells. After treated with PRIMA-1met for 48 hours, cells
were seeded in soft agar and incubated for 21 days. We
found that PRIMA-1met greatly reduced the number and
size of HCT116wt and DLD-1 cell colonies (Figure 5B).
Altogether, the in vitro migration and soft agar assay
indicated that the ability of PRIMA-1met to inhibition

cell migration and colony formation of CRC cells also
contributed to its anti-cancer activity, independent of
p53 status.

PRIMA-1met suppressed tumor growth in
xenograft mouse CRC model
To validate the anti-tumorigenic potential of
PRIMA-1met in vivo, we utilised a xenograft CRC mouse
model by subcutaneously injecting DLD-1 cells into
female NOD/SCID mice. After the mice developed
palpable tumor masses, we began PRIMA-1met treatment

for 8 days. Tumor growth during the treatment was
monitored by caliper measurement every other day.
At day 8 of post treatment, the mice were euthanized,
and the tumors were removed, and photographed. We
observed a substantial reduction in tumor growth in the
PRIMA-1met treated group in comparison with the vehicle
control treated group (Figure 6A). The PRIMA-1met
treatment group presented with tumor sizes substantially
smaller than those of the controls (Figure 6B), indicating
the efficacy of the PRIMA-1met in CRC regression.
It is important to note that during the treatment, the
mice showed tolerance to PRIMA-1met injections and
maintained normal activities and no loss of weight were
recorded (data not shown).

1met and increased IC50 of PRIMA-1met in DLD-1 and
SW480 cell lines. These results suggest that upregulation
of Noxa plays an influential role in the mediation of cell
proliferation and apoptosis in CRC cells treated with
PRIMA-1met. The importance of Noxa also has been noted
in PRIMA-1met treated multiple myeloma cells [25].
Most studies reported that PRIMA-1met targets
mutant p53 proteins [17, 32, 33]. Interestingly, in this
study, CRC cell lines with wild-type p53 or without
p53 responded to PRIMA-1met treatment. Some IC50
values of these cell lines with wild-type p53 were even
less than those carrying mutant p53. However, different
mechanisms might contribute to the effectiveness of
PRIMA-1met observed in these two types of CRC cells.
Unlike in p53 mutant CRC cells, PRIMA-1met mainly
induced cytostasis, but to less extent apoptosis, in CRC
cells with wt p53 or p53 null. The percentage of apoptotic
cells did not increased significantly after treated with
PRIMA-1met in cell lines RKO (p53 wt) and HCT116ko.
In addition, knocking down Noxa gene reduced
PRIMA-1met sensitivity in mutant p53 CRC cells, but it
didn’t significantly decrease PRIMA-1met sensitivity in
HCT116wt cell line. Taken together, these results support
a model where although PRIMA-1met inhibits proliferation
of CRC cells independently on p53 status. Nevertheless,
PRIMA-1met mainly induces cytostasis in CRC cells
with wt p53 or p53 null, whereas PRIMA-1met promotes
apoptosis in CRC cells with mutant p53. More importantly,
PRIMA-1met treatment significantly reduced tumor growth
in our mouse model and showed no noticeable toxicity to
the mice.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we shed new light on the effect of
PRIMA-1met on CRC. Our results showed that PRIMA-1met
inhibited CRC cell growth independent of p53 status in
a dose-dependent manner, but preferably induced robust
apoptosis in mutant p53 CRC cells. We further uncovered
the molecular mechanism underlying PRIMA-1met
induced-apoptosis through up-regulation of pro-apoptotic
protein Noxa, leading to activation of cleavage of PARP.
These results were consistent with previous studies that
demonstrated the ability of PRIMA-1met to restore the
mutant p53 to wild-type p53 properties in other cancers
[15, 17, 20, 21, 25]. Reduction of Noxa expression by
siRNA accentuated the inhibitive effect of PRIMAwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion, in our study PRIMA-1met inhibits
CRC cells growth, colonies formation, proliferation
and migration in a p53-independent manner. However,
the ability of to induce apoptosis appears specific in
CRC cells with mutant p53. Our in vitro and in vivo
results suggest that PRIMA-1met is an attractive
candidate for further investigation as a potential anticancer agent in clinical trials for patients with CRC.
However, we also acknowledge that the work is limited
by studying CRC lines. A deeper understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of anti-tumorigenic activity of
PRIMA-1met will allow for precise treatment regimens and

the possibility of co-treatment with other therapeutics to
greatly improve the outcome of CRC patients.

incubated for 48 hours. CellTiter-Glo (CTG) Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madsion, WI) was used
to measure the cell proliferation by quantitating the cell’s
ATP as previously reported [26]. The reading of DMSO
control samples were set as 100% and the reading of other
samples were calculated as relative proliferation to the
DMSO control samples. Each experiment was in triplicate.
The results were presented in percentage changes relative
to their respective DMSO controls.

qRT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR® Green
PCR Master Mix as recommended by the manufacturer
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). GAPDH was used
as the internal control. SDS 2.2.1 software (Applied
Biosystems) was used to perform relative quantification
of target genes using the comparative CT (ΔΔCT) method.
The primer sequences were described as the following:
Noxa (Forward: 5′-GCTGGAAGTCGAGTGTGCTA-3′,
Reverse: 5′-CCTGAGCAGAAGAGTTTGGA-3′) and
PUMA (Forward: 5′-ACGACCTCAACGCACAGTACG-3′,

(Integrated DNA Technologies, Singapore).

Cell apoptosis assay
Cells were seeded on 6-well plates at a density of
0.2 × 106 cells per well and treated with 30 μM, 60 μM
PRIMA-1met, respectively, for 48 hours. Apoptosis assay
was conducted with flow cytometric analysis of Annexin
V-FITC (Invitrogen) and Sytox Blue (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) staining cells [27]. After suspending
using trypsin and washing twice with cold PBS, cells
were counted and adjusted at 0.5 - 1.0 × 106 for each
sample, and resuspended in 100 μl 1 × binding buffer.
Each sample was added 1.5 μl Annexin V-FITC, and
incubated on ice in dark for 20 minutes. Then after added
1 μl Sytox Blue and incubated at room temperature for
5 minutes in dark, each sample was mixed with 400 μl
of 1 × binding buffer, filtered to a 5 ml BD Falcon tube
(BD  Biosciences), then to analyze by flow cytometry
within 1 hour.

siRNA transfection
HCT116wt, DLD-1 and SW480 cells were seeded
in 6-well plates 1 day for transfection at a density of
3 × 106 cells/well. Mixture containing 110 pmoles of Noxa
siRNA (sc-37305, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control
siRNA (sc-36869, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 200 μl of
jetPRIME® buffer (Polyplus-Transfection, Illkich, Franc)
and 4 μl of jetPRIME® in vitro siRNA transfection reagent
(Polyplus-Transfection) was vortexed 10 seconds, spun
down and incubated 10 minutes at room temperature.
This transfection mixture was added to each well. After
incubated for 24 hours, cells were harvested for further
analysis.

Western blotting analysis

Wound healing assay

We plated cells at 2 × 106 per 10cm dish. After
24  hours, cells were treated with DMSO control and
different dose of PRIMA-1met as indicated. After
24 hours, cells were lysed and analyzed by western
blotting as described previously [28]. Primary antibodies
used in this study were against p53 (sc-126, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), cleaved PARP (D214), Phospho-p53
(Ser15) and PUMA from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA), Noxa (EMD chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ).
Secondary antibodies were goat-anti-rabbit IgG HRP
(sc-2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat-anti-mouse
IgG HRP (sc-2031, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

HCT116wt and DLD-1 cells were seeded to four
wells in 6-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well for duplication.
After 3 days, cells were cultured to near confluence and
scratched a wound through the centre of the well. Rinsed
with PBS three times gently, two of these wells were
replaced with 2 ml of media containing DMSO as control.
The others were added with PRIMA-1met at concentration
of 15  μM. After taken pictures under microscope
(10 × magnification), plates were transferred to humidified
incubator at 37°C and incubated for 48 hours. Pictures
were taken again.

2 × 105 cells/well overnight, HCT116wt and were harvested
and 2 × 103 each cell line to mix with 3 ml top agar
(containing PRIMA-1met 10 μM, 20 μM, respectively)
gently. The mixture was added to each of the duplicated
wells in a 12-well plate with base agar (containing 0.75 ml
1 × DMEM+10% FCS and 0.75 ml 1% agar in each well)
prepared before. The plate was incubated in humidified
incubator at 37°C for 21 days, and then to stained with
0.5 ml of 0.005% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis,  MO) for 1 hour. Cell colonies formation was
observed under microscope (200× magnification).

Soft agar assay

All CRC cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a
density of 0.4 × 106 cells/well to grow overnight. RKO,
Colo320, DLD-1 and SW480 cells were treated with 60 μM
PRIMA-1met for 24 hours. HCT116wt cells with 30  μM
PRIMA-1met and HCT116ko cells with 120 μM PRIMA-1met
were incubated for 24 hours. RNA was isolated from cells
using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Typically,
1 μg of total RNA was used to generate cDNA by using

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed by SPSS
version 13.0. Values were expressed as mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM). Comparison between groups
of data was made using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Tumour volume reduction of the treatment
groups was compared to the vehicle control group by
Student’s t-test. p  < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
