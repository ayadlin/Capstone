ABSTRACT
Background: This first-in-human study evaluated AMG 208, a small-molecule MET
inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Methods: Three to nine patients were enrolled into one of seven AMG 208 dose
cohorts (25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 400 mg). Patients received AMG 208 orally on
days 1 and days 4–28 once daily. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety,
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AMG 208.
Results: Fifty-four patients were enrolled. Six dose-limiting toxicities were
observed: grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase (200 mg), grade 3
thrombocytopenia (200 mg), grade 4 acute myocardial infarction (300 mg), grade 3
prolonged QT (300 mg), and two cases of grade 3 hypertension (400 mg). The MTD
was not reached. The most frequent grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse event was
anemia (n = 3) followed by hypertension, prolonged QT, and thrombocytopenia (two
patients each). AMG 208 exposure increased linearly with dose; mean plasma halflife estimates were 21.4–68.7 hours. One complete response (prostate cancer) and
three partial responses (two in prostate cancer, one in kidney cancer) were observed.
Conclusions: In this study, AMG 208 had manageable toxicities and showed
evidence of antitumor activity, particularly in prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

11], providing a strong rationale for targeting MET [1-3].
Elevated MET expression has been correlated with poor
prognosis [7], and MET amplification has been associated
with drug resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) inhibitors [12, 13]. Preclinical data suggest that
concurrently inhibiting the MET and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) pathways has synergistic effects
[14].
AMG 208 is a small-molecule MET inhibitor
with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) against wildtype MET of 5.2 nM. At higher concentrations, AMG
208 inhibited other kinases, such as VEGF receptor

The receptor tyrosine kinase MET mediates multiple
cellular processes, including proliferation, survival,
migration, and invasion in normal and tumor cells [13]. MET can be activated through various mechanisms,
such as ligand-dependent activation through binding of
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and ligand-independent
activation through overexpression, gene amplification, and
activating mutations [1]. MET is often dysregulated in
various cancers, including lymphoma, melanoma, gastric,
lung, colorectal, head and neck, renal, and ovarian [4www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in human
tumor xenograft models (data on file).
We conducted a first-in-human study of AMG 208
to investigate its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
and pharmacodynamics in patients with advanced solid
tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00813384). We
also evaluated antitumor activity and MET expression,
amplification, and mutation status as potential biomarkers
of response.

were enrolled. Table 1 summarizes demographics and
baseline characteristics. The most common primary tumor
types were prostate (18.5%) followed by colon (11.1%),
esophageal (11.1%), and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC, 11.1%). Reasons for discontinuing AMG 208
treatment included disease progression (64.8%), adverse
events (AEs, 16.7%), withdrawal of partial consent
(5.6%), and requirement for alternative therapy (3.7%).
The median number of AMG 208 doses received per
patient was 27 (range, 1–671) and was highest in the 400mg cohort (110; range, 9–306). Three (5.6%) patients had
dose reductions.

Safety and tolerability

Patient characteristics and disposition

Six patients had DLTs: 200 mg (n = 2), 300 mg (n
= 2), and 400 mg (n = 2). In the 200-mg cohort, seven
patients were initially enrolled, of whom two had a DLT
(grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase [AST]
and grade 3 thrombocytopenia), four completed without
a DLT, and one withdrew early from the study due to
disease progression. The protocol was amended to deescalate to 150 mg and then re-escalate to 200 mg (Figure
1); three additional patients were then enrolled to the 200mg cohort, of whom two completed without a DLT, and

Fifty-four patients were enrolled and received ≥1
dose of AMG 208: 25 mg (n = 6), 50 mg (n = 4), 100
mg (n = 4), 150 mg (n = 3), 200 mg (n = 16), 300 mg
(n = 10), and 400 (n = 11). The first patient enrolled on
December 29, 2008, and the last patient completed the
study on July 25, 2012. In the 25-mg cohort, the first three
patients enrolled were not evaluable (did not complete the
dose-limiting toxicity [DLT] assessment period defined as
the first 28 days of treatment), so three additional patients

AMG 208 dose cohorts: 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 400 mg. A standard 3+3 design was followed in cohorts 1–3, and a modified 3+3+3
design was followed in cohorts 4–7. The protocol was amended to evaluate an intermediate dose level of 150 mg after two DLTs (out of six
patients) were observed with 200 mg AMG 208 (red arrow); re-escalation to 200 mg occurred after the 150-mg dose cohort was considered
well tolerated (red arrow).

Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac catheterization revealed ulcerated plaques in
the right coronary artery and moderate/diffuse disease of
the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries. The
hypertension was observed in a 76-year-old male with
stage IV prostate cancer who had a history of controlled
hypertension. His blood pressure was elevated on days
7 to 10 of the study and ranged from 178/88 to 210/90.
There were no other predisposing risk factors for elevated
blood pressure except for the presence of bone pain before
and during the event. AMG 208 was discontinued, and the
event resolved within 4 days of discontinuation.
Five patients died during the study, and none
were considered treatment related (disease progression,
n = 4; pulmonary hemorrhage, n = 1). The patient with
pulmonary hemorrhage was diagnosed with pulmonary
hypertension and pulmonary aspergillosis and had clear
evidence of metastatic disease in the lung; thus, the grade
5 pulmonary hemorrhage was considered related to the
disease.

The pharmacodynamic effects of AMG 208 on the
following circulating biomarkers were evaluated: soluble
MET, HGF, placental growth factor (PlGF), VEGF-R2,
c-Kit, sFlt-1, VEGF, serum C-terminal telopeptide of
type 1 collagen (sCTx), type 1 procollagen N-terminal
propeptide (P1NP), and bone alkaline phosphatase
(BALP). PlGF demonstrated a pharmacodynamic response
to AMG 208; mean PlGF levels increased the most with
the 400-mg dose at all time points (Figure 3). No other
circulating biomarkers demonstrated a pharmacodynamic
effect.

Antitumor activity
Forty-three patients had responses evaluated at the
sites based on computed tomography (CT) and/or bone
scans using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria
for Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. Eleven patients
went off study early (due to disease progression [n = 3],
DLT [n = 3], AE [n = 3], partial consent withdrawn [n =
1], or ineligibility determined after first dose [n = 1]) and
had no follow-up scans for response evaluation. Figure
4A shows the change in the sum of the longest diameter
for the best postdose response. There were one complete
response (CR) and three partial responses (PRs). The CR
was observed in a 66-year-old patient with prostate cancer
at week 18, based on nontarget lesions evaluated by bone
scans (300-mg cohort, Figure 5A); this patient was on the
study for approximately 57 weeks. One confirmed PR
was observed in a patient with kidney cancer at week 9
(200-mg cohort); this patient had a 33% tumor reduction
and was on the study for approximately 23 weeks.
Two unconfirmed PRs were observed in two patients
with prostate cancer (both 400-mg cohort). One patient
had a 33% tumor reduction and was on the study for

Pharmacokinetics
AMG 208 pharmacokinetics was estimated for 53
patients who received ≥1 dose of AMG 208. After oral
administration, linear increases of approximately 10- to
12-fold were observed over the 25- to 400-mg dose range
in maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the
concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0–
) exposures. In the 400-mg cohort, mean Cmax and AUC0–
24h
exposures on day 28 were 18.4 µg/mL and 245 µg•h/
24h
mL, respectively. Mean plasma concentration-time profiles
from each cohort are shown for 36 patients who completed
28 days of AMG 208 dosing (Figure 2). AMG 208 mean
plasma half-life estimates ranged from 21.4 to 68.7 hours
and were consistent with a 1.81- to 3.43-fold accumulation
observed after 28 days of repeated dosing.

follow-up scans, and one patient had incomplete coverage
of target lesion at the follow-up scan and could not be
evaluated. Thirty-three patients had stable disease, and
nine patients had progressive disease.
Antitumor activity was further evaluated by
3’-deoxy-3’-18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) positron
emission tomography (PET) scans (Figure 4B). Twenty-

seven patients had evaluable baseline and week 5 18F-FLTPET scans. Seven patients had ≥25% reduction from
baseline in 18F-FLT uptake (maximum standardized uptake
value [SUVmax]) at week 5 day 29, indicating a treatment
response in tumor cell proliferation. Two of the seven
proliferative responders (1 patient with prostate cancer
[Figure 5B] and 1 patient with kidney cancer) also had PR
by RECIST 1.0 (33% reduction based on site read).

Of the 10 patients with prostate cancer, three
patients had a response per modified RECIST 1.0. As
mentioned earlier, one patient with prostate cancer had
a CR on bone scan (300-mg cohort). Two patients with
prostate cancer had unconfirmed PRs based on CT scans,
both in the 400-mg cohort. One patient had a 33% tumor
reduction at week 17. The second patient had a 41% tumor
reduction at week 27. Furthermore, three patients with
prostate cancer were proliferative responders (36%, 41%,
and 42% reductions in 18F-FLT uptake).

weeks with cabozantinib versus placebo), and 72% of
evaluable patients had regression in soft tissue lesions
with cabozantinib treatment [15]. It was postulated that
cabozantinib’s efficacy may be due to the simultaneous
inhibition of MET and VEGF, and that the sole targeting
of either the MET or VEGF pathways may not be
sufficient in this disease. However, recent findings from
the phase 3 study in castration-resistant prostate cancer
showed no statistically significant improvement in OS
with cabozantinib versus prednisone (median OS: 11
versus 9.8 months) [18], indicating that the hypothesis that
efficacy in prostate cancer is due to dual inhibition of MET
and VEGF may not be justified. AMG 208 has a different
target coverage profile than cabozantinib; hence, lack of
efficacy with cabozantinib in the prostate cancer setting
may not be of relevance to AMG 208. . Furthermore, in
another study, androgen deprivation was associated with a
switch to MET signaling in prostate cancer cells [19]. All
10 patients with prostate cancer in the current study had
previous androgen deprivation therapy.
Differences were observed between investigatorassessed and centrally assessed tumor responses; these
may be attributable to inadequacies of RECIST 1.0,
which considers bone and cystic lesions as nonmeasurable
lesions. Some lesions defined as responders in the site
reads per RECIST 1.0 were possibly bone or cystic lesions
that the investigators considered as measurable lesions.
Moreover, different lesions may have been measured in
the site and central reads.
Patients selected by MET protein overexpression
and MET amplification in gastroesophageal cancers [20,
21], MET germline mutations in papillary renal cell cancer
[17], and chromosome polyploidy in gastric cancer [22]
have been associated with response to MET inhibitors.
However, in our exploratory and retrospective analysis
of MET in the study, no apparent associations between
MET expression, amplification, and mutation status were
observed. The results suggest that increased levels of MET
expression by IHC did not correlate with response to MET
inhibition as observed with AMG 208. One consideration
is that some patients were treated during dose-escalation
of AMG 208 and may not have received adequate doses to
inhibit the pathway. Moreover, there may be a minimum
threshold at which the MET/CEP7 ratio confers MET
dependency and sensitivity to AMG 208, similar to recent
reports of HER-2 and trastuzumab in gastric cancer [23].
Finally, these analyses were limited by the small sample
size.
AMG 208 at 400 mg was the highest administered
dose in this study. Although the MTD was not reached,
the 400 mg dose was considered the recommended phase
2 dose. AMG 208 was initially investigated as a MET
inhibitor. As mentioned earlier, the responses observed
in prostate cancer are likely a result of its multikinase
activity, similar to cabozantinib. The study was stopped
before enrollment into the dose expansion phase.

Biomarkers
Twenty-two, 29, and 25 patients were analyzed for
MET by immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH), and sequencing, respectively.
No associations between response and MET testing were
observed (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
In this first-in-human study of AMG 208, an oral
MET inhibitor, the MTD was not reached at the highest
dose tested (400 mg), and AMG 208 had manageable
toxicities. The most common any grade AEs included
fatigue and nausea; the most common grade ≥3 AE was
anemia. DLTs were reported in six patients at the 200- to
400-mg dose levels.
Similar toxicities were observed with AMG 208 as
seen with other multikinase VEGF/MET inhibitors. In
clinical studies of cabozantinib, a multikinase MET and
VEGF inhibitor, common AEs included fatigue, decreased
appetite, and diarrhea [15, 16], AEs also observed with
AMG 208. Moreover, in a phase 2 study, foretinib, a dual
MET/VEGF-R2 inhibitor, had a similar toxicity profile to
AMG 208; common AEs included fatigue, hypertension,
and gastrointestinal toxicities [17].
AMG 208 was orally bioavailable at the doses tested
and exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. AMG
208 exposures increased linearly up to the 400-mg dose
level, and mean estimates of elimination half-life ranged
from 21.4 to 68.7 hours. After 28 days of once daily
AMG 208 dosing, mean unbound trough concentrations
ranged from 12.3 to 199 nM, thus exceeding the in vitro
IC50 estimate against wild-type MET (5.2 nM) at all dose
levels. Among patients who received the 300- and 400mg AMG 208 doses, unbound trough concentrations
approximated or slightly exceeded the in vitro IC50 against
VEGF-R2 (112 nM), which might explain higher increases
in mean PIGF levels that were observed at the 400 mg
dose level.
AMG 208 showed encouraging antitumor activity
in prostate cancer, as suggested by the CR, 2 PRs, and 3
proliferative responses. In a phase 2 study of cabozantinib
in prostate cancer, PFS was longer (23.9 versus 5.9

It is hypothesized that inhibiting the MET pathway
may overcome resistance to various therapies, including
anti-EGFR inhibitors, platinum chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy [24]. In a phase 1 study, tivantinib, a MET
inhibitor and microtubule polymerization inhibitor
[25], combined with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor,
showed promising clinical activity with PR or stable
disease observed in 15 of 32 patients [26]; in this same
combination study, 6 of 8 patients with NSCLC achieved
stable disease [26]. AMG 208 combined with other
therapies has yet to be evaluated in clinical studies.
Crosstalk between MET and other receptors, such as
EGFR, HER2, integrin, and RON, may play a role in
the development of resistance to targeted therapies, thus
providing rationale to investigate MET pathway inhibitors
in combination therapies.
MET continues to be an important target for cancer
therapy. In addition to AMG 208, other small molecule
MET inhibitors are under clinical development, some
being selective inhibitors (eg, volitinib) and others being
multikinase inhibitors (eg, crizotinib and cabozantinib)
[24]. Several selective small molecule MET inhibitors
have recently shown activity in early clinical trials, which
include ABT-700 [27], AMG 337 [28], INC280 [29],
MSC2156119J [30], SAR125844 [31], and volitinib [32].
Monoclonal antibodies targeting the MET pathway (eg,
onartuzumab and rilotumumab) have also been evaluated
in clinical trials [24]. Furthermore nanobodies to MET
and indozoles have been tested in the preclinical setting as
potential inhibitors of MET [33, 34].
In conclusion, AMG 208 was well tolerated as
monotherapy at doses up to 400 mg in patients with
advanced solid tumors. Future studies evaluating MET
pathway inhibitors, particularly in prostate cancer and/or
in combination therapies, are warranted.

x ULN (if liver involvement was present, < 2 x ULN),
alkaline phosphatase < 2 x ULN (if liver involvement or
bone metastasis was present, ≤5 x ULN), and prothrombin
or partial thromboplastin time < 1.5 x institutional ULN.
Patients with primary central nervous system tumors or
metastases were excluded. Each patient provided informed
consent. Institutional review board approval was obtained
for all study procedures.

Study design
This first-in-human, open-label study was to be
conducted in two parts: (1) dose escalation and (2) dose
expansion. In the dose escalation phase, 3–9 patients
were enrolled into 1 of 7 dose cohorts (25, 50, 100, 150,
200, 300, and 400 mg) of AMG 208 (Figure 1). Patients
were administered AMG 208 as a single oral dose
followed by a 72-hour treatment-free period to evaluate
pharmacokinetics. Beginning on day 4, patients received
daily oral doses of AMG 208 up to day 28. If no DLT
was seen on days 1–28, patients with no evident disease
progression received AMG 208.
A DLT was defined as any grade ≥3 nonhematologic
or grade 4 hematologic AE occurring during the first
28 days of treatment and possibly AMG 208 related.
Treatment-related grade 3 thrombocytopenia could
be considered a DLT if accompanied by grade ≥2
hemorrhage. Fatigue (unless grade 3 and lasting > 7 days
or grade 4) and lymphopenia were not considered DLTs.
For patients with liver involvement or bone metastases,
DLTs did not include elevations in alkaline phosphatase
unless > 8 x ULN when the baseline level was 2–5 x
ULN. For patients with liver involvement, DLTs did not
include elevations in AST or ALT unless > 8 x ULN and
the baseline level was 3–5 x ULN. Serum creatinine > 2.5
mg/dL was considered a DLT.
In cohorts 1–3, a standard 3+3 design was followed.
Enrollment into the next dose level occurred if no patients
in the initial cohort experienced a DLT in the first 28
days of treatment. If a DLT occurred, the cohort was
expanded to six patients. Enrollment into the next dose
level occurred if no DLTs were observed. If ≥2 DLTs
were observed among the six patients, enrollment was
to be stopped. Following a report of two DLTs (out of
six patients) at the 200-mg dose level, the protocol was
amended to evaluate an intermediate dose level of 150
mg, and if well tolerated, re-escalation to the 200-mg
dose level would occur. In cohorts 4–7, a modified 3+3+3
design was followed in order toprovide additional data to
ascertain dose selection; if a second DLT was observed,
three additional patients were to be enrolled at the same
dose level for a total of at least nine patients. If no DLTs
were observed, dose escalation to the next dose level
would occur.
To enrich this study, patients with tumors with MET
amplification or mutation (MET positive) were allowed

detection (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of
HGF were analyzed using an analyte-specific enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer’s
instructions and were compared to a standard curve.
Samples were prepared and analyzed as previously
described [36]. Levels of sCTx were quantified using
the Serum Crosslaps ELISA (IDS Nordic, Herlev,
Denmark) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Levels of P1NP were quantified by radioimmunoassay
(RIA) using the UniQ PINP RIA kit following the
manufacturer’s instructions and were compared to a
standard curve (Covance Laboratories). Levels of BALP
were quantified using the Access Ostase assay, a one-step
immunoenzymatic assay, following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN).

Study objectives
The primary objectives were to evaluate the
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of AMG
208 and determine the MTD. Secondary objectives
included evaluating tumor volume changes by CT
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), decreases in
tumor cell proliferation with 18F-FLT-PET scanning,
potential biomarkers that reflect MET target coverage,
and associations among response and MET expression,
amplification, and mutation.

Antitumor activity

Safety

Tumor response was assessed by contrast-enhanced
CT or MRI at screening; week 5; week 9; and every 8
weeks thereafter until disease progression and was
evaluated by investigators based on modified RECIST
version 1.0, which allowed some patients with metastatic
prostate cancer and only nontarget bone lesions at
screening to be evaluated with bone scans only. Response
was also evaluated by an independent central imaging
laboratory. Proliferative response was assessed by 18F-FLTPET scans at baseline and week 5. An antiproliferative
response was defined as ≥25% reduction in 18F-FLT
SUVmax.

Safety was evaluated based on AEs, vital signs,
clinical laboratory measurements, electrocardiograms,
and physical examinations. AEs were graded according
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
version 3.0.

Pharmacokinetics
AMG 208 pharmacokinetics was evaluated after
a single dose and after 28 days of repeated daily dose
administrations. AMG 208 plasma concentrations were
determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry from samples collected predose, 0.5, 1, 2,
4, 8, 24, and 48 or 72 hours after dosing on day 1, and
pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours on day 28.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of observed Cmax, time of Cmax
(tmax), and AUC0–24h were determined by noncompartmental
analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin software version 6.3
(Pharsight, St. Louis, MO). AMG 208 accumulation was
estimated as a ratio of AUC0–24h on day 28 relative to day
1 for patients who remained on the study for ≥28 days.

Biomarkers
Archival
formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tumor samples were analyzed for membrane
and cytoplasmic MET expression by IHC at Mosaic
Laboratories (Lake Forest, CA). Tumors were sectioned
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to identify regions
of high tumor-cell content. IHC was performed using an
anti-MET antibody (goat IgG, polyclonal, clone AF276)
from R&D Systems. Staining was evaluated by a trained
pathologist, and expression was evaluated for cellular
localization of staining, intensity, subcellular localization,
and percentage of tumor cells staining positive. Staining
was evaluated on a semi-quantitative scale, and the
percentage of tumor cells staining at the following
intensities was recorded: 0 (unstained), 1+ (weak staining),
2+ (moderate staining), and 3+ (strong staining). An
H-score was calculated based on the percentage of cells
stained at each intensity as follows: (3 x percent cells
staining at 3+) + (2 x percent cells staining at 2+) + (1 x
percent cells staining at 1+).
Archival FFPE tumor samples were analyzed for

Pharmacodynamics
Serum samples were collected on days 1 and 2;
predose on days 8, 15, 22, 28; on day 64; and every 4
weeks thereafter and were analyzed for soluble MET,
HGF, PlGF, VEGF-R2, c-Kit, sFlt-1, VEGF, sCTx, P1NP,
and BALP. Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated
using time profiles with the mean ratio to baseline and
standard error bars by treatment arms.
Levels of soluble MET, PlGF, VEGF, VEGF-R2,
c-Kit, and sFlt-1 were quantified using multiplexed
sandwich immunoassays with electrochemiluminescent

MET amplification by FISH at Histogenex Laboratories
(Antwerp, Belgium). Tumors were pretreated and stained
with MET/SE7 Probe kit (KBI-10719, Kreatech, Durham,
NC) using a VP2000 autostainer and a Thermobrite Hybrid
system (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) following the
manufacturers’ instructions. Twenty nuclei were evaluated
per sample, and the quantification of MET and SE7 signals
was used to calculate the average MET copies per nuclei,
average centromeric copies per nuclei, and the ratio of
MET copies to SE7 copies.
DNA was extracted from archival FFPE tumor
samples and interrogated for MET mutations using the
SURVEYOR Nuclease assay (Transgenomic, Inc., Omaha,
NE) followed by Sanger sequencing.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics on continuous data included
means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges.
Categorical data were summarized by frequency counts
and percentages. All patients who received ≥1 dose of
AMG 208 were included in the safety analyses. Treatmentemergent and treatment-related AEs occurring after the
initial dose of AMG 208 and before the end of the study
or 30 days after the last dose of AMG 208 (whichever
occurred later) were presented descriptively. No formal
analysis was done for efficacy. An exploratory summary
of tumor response was produced. Descriptive analyses
for biomarkers and associations between biomarkers and
efficacy were produced. Results from the primary analysis
