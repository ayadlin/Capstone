The histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is frequently dysregulated in cancers, and gain-of-function
(GOF) EZH2 mutations have been identiﬁed in non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Small-molecule inhibitors against EZH2 demonstrated
anti-tumor activity in EZH2-mutated lymphomas and entered clinical trials. Here, we developed models of acquired resistance to
EZH2 inhibitor EI1 with EZH2-mutated lymphoma cells. Resistance was generated by secondary mutations in both wild-type (WT)
and GOF Y641N EZH2 alleles. These EZH2 mutants retained the substrate speciﬁcity of their predecessor complexes but became
refractory to biochemical inhibition by EZH2 inhibitors. Resistant cells were able to maintain a high level of H3K27Me3 in the
presence of inhibitors. Interestingly, mutation of EZH2 WT alone generated an intermediate resistance phenotype, which is
consistent with a previously proposed model of cooperation between EZH2 WT and Y641N mutants to promote tumorigenesis. In
addition, the ﬁndings presented here have implications for the clinical translation of EZH2 inhibitors and underscore the need to
develop novel EZH2 inhibitors to target potential resistance emerging in clinical settings.

INTRODUCTION
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is required during normal
embryonic development to maintain transcriptional repression of
key developmental regulators.1–3 Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2
(EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of PRC2, which methylates H3K27 to
repress transcription.4 In cancers, EZH2 can be ampliﬁed and
overexpressed, and elevated expression of EZH2 often correlates
with poor prognosis.5,6 Somatic activating mutations in the SET
domain of EZH2 have been identiﬁed in several cancers, including
follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.5,7,8 Tyr641
(Y641) is a hot-spot mutation in these lymphomas, and Y641
mutants have altered substrate speciﬁcity compared with WT
EZH2. They show increased activity against di-methylated H3K27
and decreased activity toward unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27, resulting in a massive increase of the level of H3K27
trimethylation in the cell.9,10 Increased EZH2 activity is believed to
suppress cell cycle checkpoint genes and cellular differentiation
programs to promote tumorigenesis.
We and others have reported the development of highly
potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors against EZH2,
including EI1, EPZ-6438 (also known as E7438), compound 3 and
GSK126.11–14 These inhibitors act competitively with respect to the
methyl-group donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to suppress the
enzymatic activity of EZH2. They inhibit EZH2 WT and Y641
mutants and show high selectivity against other histone
methyltransferases. In cells, EZH2 inhibitors speciﬁcally suppress
H3K27 di- and trimethylation and reactivate the expression of
target genes that had been repressed by PRC2 and H3K27
trimethylation, such as cell cycle checkpoint genes and GC-B-cell
differentiation genes.11,13–17 Potent anti-tumor activity has been

observed in multiple cell lines and animal models, causing tumor
regression in animal tumor models of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma,11–15 malignant rhabdoid cancer14,16 and ependymomas.18
Two inhibitors (EPZ-6438 and GSK2816126) are now in
clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01897571;
http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02082977).
Acquired resistance is a major problem often limiting the longterm effectiveness of targeted cancer therapeutics. Resistance can
be acquired through secondary mutations or ampliﬁcation of the
primary drug targets, or activation of bypass signaling pathways.19
In this study, we investigated if cancer cells might also develop
resistance to highly targeted epigenetic agents such as EZH2
inhibitors. A highly potent EZH2 inhibitor EI114 was used to
generate resistance in a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line
KARPAS422, which contains a heterozygous EZH2 Y641N mutation
(EZH2wt/EZH2Y641N). EI1 inhibits EZH2 WT and the Y641 mutant in
biochemical assays with a half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of 10–
20 nM.14 KARPAS422 is highly sensitive to EI1, which triggers
growth arrest and apoptosis.14 Acquired resistance was generated
following prolonged exposure to EI1, and two novel missense
mutations of EZH2 (Y111L and Y661D) were speciﬁcally identiﬁed
in the resistant cells. Y661D occurred cis to the EZH2Y641N allele,
whereas Y111L occurred at the EZH2WT allele. Biochemical
characterization showed that these PRC2 mutant complexes
retained the substrate speciﬁcity of the respective predecessor
complexes. However, unlike PRC2WT and PRC2Y641N complexes,
both PRC2Y111L and PRC2Y641N/Y661D complexes were refractory to
biochemical inhibition by EZH2 inhibitors. Furthermore, we
showed that mutation of EZH2WT allele alone (Y111L) was able
to create a state of partial resistance. This is consistent with a

model in which PRC2WT cooperates with PRC2Y641N to elevate
H3K27Me3 levels, thus promoting tumorigenesis. Therefore,
targeting both EZH2 WT and Y641N should achieve most effective
anti-tumor response.
In summary, this study has implications for clinical translation
and further development of novel EZH2 inhibitors. First, monitoring EZH2 mutation status is warranted during clinical trials with
patients with de novo and acquired resistance. Second, development of novel EZH2 inhibitors should be considered given the
potential emergence of resistance in clinics.
RESULTS
Identiﬁcation of resistance mutations in EZH2
EZH2 inhibitors have shown strong anti-proliferative responses in
KARPAS422 lymphoma cells with complete tumor regression in
xenograft models.12,14,15 Here, we used the KARPAS422 cell line
2 & 10μM EI1, 60 days

559
(K-P) as a model system to investigate potential resistance to EZH2
inhibitors. The experimental scheme is described in Figure 1a. K-P
cells were cultured in the presence of 2 or 10 μM EI1 for 60 days.
After 60 days of continuous treatment, we were able to derive
resistant cells from the 2 μM treatment group (K-R2), whereas no
resistant cells were recovered from the 10 μM treatment group.
However, we were able to adapt K-R2 cells, in medium containing
10 μM EI1 for an additional 10 days, to obtain K-R10 cells.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed to obtain 10
independent single-cell clones from each of the K-R2 and K-R10
pools, identiﬁed as K-R2#1-10 and K-R10#1-10, respectively
(Figure 1a).
K-R2 and K-R10 cells were able to proliferate in medium with or
without EI1, although they exhibit a slightly slower growth rate
compared with K-P cells (Figure 1b). K-R2 and K-R10 cells were
able to maintain H3K27Me3 levels in the presence of EI1 that were
comparable to the basal levels of H3K27Me3 in K-P cells without

any EI1 treatment (Figure 1c). As EZH2 and EZH1 are the only
known mammalian H3K27 methyltransferases, we investigated if
their expression had been altered in the resistant cells. No
signiﬁcant change of EZH2 and EZH1 expression was observed in
K-R2 and K-R10 cells compared with K-P cells (Figure 1c).
To investigate whether PRC2 complexes were genetically
altered in resistant cells, RNA-seq analysis was carried out. The
EZH2 Y641N mutation showed an allele frequency of approximately 50% across all samples (K-P, K-R2 and K-R10), suggesting
equal expression of EZH2 WT and Y641N. Importantly, two novel
missense point mutations of EZH2 were identiﬁed in K-R2 and
K-R10 (Figures 1a and d); these sequence alterations were also
conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Figure 1). A
dinucleotide change of AT → TA resulted in a single amino-acid
change at codon 111 from Tyrosine (Y) to Leucine (L) and a singlenucleotide change of T → A resulted in another amino-acid
change at codon 661 from Tyrosine (Y) to Aspartic acid (D;
Figure 1d). The allele frequency of Y111L was 32% and 47% in
K-R2 and K-R10, respectively (Supplementary Table 1A), but not
detected in K-P cells. The allele frequency of Y661D was 2% and
19% in K-R2 and K-R10, respectively, whereas only a very low level
of this sequence alteration was detected in K-P cells (0.3%;
Supplementary Table 1A). No sequence alterations were found in
other PRC2 complex subunits including SUZ12, EED, AEBP2,
RbAp48 and EZH1. K-R2- and K-R10-derived cell clones were
sequenced by Sanger sequencing and the mutation spectra are
shown in Figure 1a and Supplementary Table 1B. All clones
contained the Y111L mutation. Although 3 out of 10 of K-R2derived clones had the Y661D mutation, 9 out of 10 of K-R10derived clones contained this mutation. Interestingly, Y661 is in
close molecular proximity to the EZH2-activating mutation Y641N
(Figure 1d) and the SAM/SAH (S-adenosylhomocysteine)-binding
region (Figure 1e). Further analysis of the RNA-seq data showed
that the Y661D mutation was always found in sequences where
amino-acid residue 641 was N, therefore the Y661D mutation
resided in the EZH2Y641N allele. To investigate which EZH2 alleles
contained the Y111L alteration, mutant sequences were cloned
from multiple clones and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. In
contrast to Y661D, Y111L was only found in the context of the
EZH2WT allele. In summary, two secondary mutations of EZH2 were
identiﬁed in the resistant cells: the Y111L mutation transforming
the EZH2WT allele and the Y661D mutation cis to the EZH2Y641N
allele. These data provide genetic evidence that both EZH2 WT
and mutant proteins are targeted by EI1 in cells.
K-R2 and K-R10 cells were resistant to multiple EZH2 inhibitors
To evaluate if this mode of resistance was unique to EI1,
we tested two additional EZH2 inhibitors, EPZ-643812 and
compound 311 against four K-R2- and K-R10-derived cell clones.
All three compounds inhibit EZH2 enzymatic activity through
SAM-competitive mechanisms. However, EPZ-6438 and EI1
share the pyridone scaffold while compound 3 does not.
EPZ-6438 was more effective compared with EI1 in reversing
the cellular H3K27Me3 level to H3K27Me0 (Figure 2a) and was
also more potent in inducing growth arrest (Figure 2b).
Importantly, all four K-R2- and K-R10-derived cell clones were
also refractory to EPZ-6438 in a cell proliferation assay, similar to
EI1 (Figures 2c and d).
The 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay is a
more sensitive cellular assay to quantitate the anti-proliferative
effect of EZH2 inhibitors. Cells were ﬁrst treated with 10 μM EI1 or
EPZ-6438 for 6 days and pulsed with BrdU at day 7 to quantitate
actively proliferating cells undergoing DNA synthesis (Figure 2e).
EI1 and EPZ-6438 almost completely suppressed DNA synthesis in
K-P cells, causing 490% reduction of BrdU incorporation
compared with the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control
(Figure 2e). In all four resistant clones, EI1 treatment did not
Oncogene (2016) 558 – 566

signiﬁcantly inhibit BrdU incorporation compared with DMSO
controls. With EPZ-6438, all four resistant clones showed partial
resistance, as indicated by an intermediate reduction of BrdU
incorporation compared with the DMSO-treated K-P control. The
degree of resistance toward EPZ-6438 appeared more prominent
in clones containing double EZH2 mutations, as KR-10#6 and #7
contain both Y111L and Y661D mutations, whereas the KR-2#4
and #5 only contain the Y111L mutation.
Compound 3 exhibited much weaker anti-proliferative activity,
consistent with its weaker potency inhibiting the PRC2 complex
in vitro (Table 2). Treatment of K-P cells with 10 μM of compound 3
for 6 days resulted in 460% reduction of BrdU incorporation
compared with DMSO controls (Supplementary Figure 2). Noticeably, none of the resistant clones showed a decrease in BrdU
incorporation compared with DMSO controls. Collectively, these
data showed that the resistant cells were refractory to all EZH2
inhibitors tested.
PRC2Y641N/Y661D was refractory to biochemical inhibition by EZH2
inhibitors
Examination of the homology model of EZH2 shows that residue
Y661D is in close proximity to the SAM/SAH-binding site
(Figure 1e). The structural changes incurred by the Y661D
mutation provide expanded volume in this region, increasing
the distance between this residue and the centroid of any ligand
occupying this pocket. The Y661 → D mutation would also change
the hydrophilic nature of the binding site. Being a SAMcompetitive inhibitor,14 EI1 would likely occupy at least a portion
of this binding site, and hence it is possible that the Y661D
mutation might interfere with the binding of EI1 to EZH2.
To fully characterize their substrate speciﬁcity and inhibitor
proﬁle, WT and mutant PRC2 complexes were reconstituted
in vitro (Supplementary Figure 3). Biochemical reactions were
performed using H3 peptides (a.a. 21–44) with K27Me0, K27Me1
or K27Me2 as substrates. PRC2WT was most active with H3K27Me0
and least active with H3K27Me2, whereas the PRC2Y641N complex
had the reverse substrate preference (Figure 3a and Table 1),
consistent with a previous report.9 PRC2Y641N/Y661D showed
identical substrate preference as PRC2Y641N, exhibiting undetectable activity with H3K27Me0 and increased activity with
H3K27Me1 and Me2 (Figure 3a and Table 1). Steady-state kinetic
analysis showed PRC2Y641N/Y661D had a higher Km for SAM
(5.1- and 3.8-fold for H3K27Me1 and Me2, respectively) compared
with PRC2Y641N. PRC2Y641N/Y661D also showed higher Km for
H3K27Me1 and Me2 (4- and 2.6-fold, respectively) compared with
PRC2Y641N. The catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km) of PRC2Y641N was
slightly higher compared with PRC2Y641N/Y661D, with a noticeable
threefold difference with H3K27Me1 (Table 1).
Next, we investigated if PRC2Y641N/Y661D can be inhibited by
EZH2 inhibitors in vitro. Biochemical reactions were carried out
with [SAM] at Km value of 1 or 20 μM (approximating physiological
concentrations). EI1, EPZ-6438 and compound 3 all showed much
reduced potency to inhibit PRC2Y641N/Y661D compared with
PRC2Y641N. For example, when the reaction was carried out at
1 μM SAM, IC50 values of EI1 against PRC2Y641N/Y661D were 4300fold weaker compared with PRC2Y641N with both H3K27Me1 and
Me2 substrates (Supplementary Figure 4 and Supplementary
Table 2). Importantly, EI1 showed IC50 values of 0.1 μM (H3K27Me1)
and 0.2 μM (H3K27Me2) against PRC2Y641N at 20 μM SAM, whereas
it was inactive against PRC2Y641N/Y661D with an IC50425 μM (for
H3K27Me1 and Me2; Table 2 and Figure 3b). Similar results were
observed with EPZ-6438 and compound 3 (Table 2,
Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 and Supplementary Table 2). All
three compounds also showed a shift in IC50 values when assayed
at 1 μM versus 20 μM SAM, as expected for SAM-competitive
inhibitors (Supplementary Figures 4–6). Taken together, the
PRC2Y641N/Y661D complex was catalytically active and shared

identical substrate preference with its predecessor PRC2Y641N
complex, but was refractory to biochemical inhibition by all EZH2
inhibitors.
Y111L mutation restored PRC2WT activity in the presence of
inhibitor to promote resistance
The Y111L mutation occurred in the context of the EZH2WT allele
and was present in all resistant clones. Seven out of the ten
resistant clones derived from the 2 μM EI1 treatment group (KR-2)
carried the Y111L mutation alone, suggesting this was sufﬁcient to
confer resistance to a low dose of EI1. We considered two different
hypothetical mechanisms by which the Y111L mutation might
confer resistance. First, Y111L might mimic Y641N function,
exhibiting enhanced H3K27Me2 → Me3 activity to generate
resistance. Alternatively, Y111L might maintain the biochemical
properties of PRC2WT but be refractory to inhibition by EZH2

inhibitors. The ﬁrst scenario would imply that restoring the gainof-function enzymatic activity is important for the development of
resistance. If the latter is true, it would suggest restoration of EZH2
WT activity is a critical step toward resistance.
We carried out biochemical assays as above to characterize the
PRC2Y111L complex. Similar to PRC2WT, PRC2Y111L was active
against H3K27Me0 and Me1 and was inactive against H3K27Me2
(Figure 3a and Table 1). kcat and Km values for SAM, H3K27Me0 and
Me1 for PRC2Y111L were similar to those of PRC2WT, resulting in
comparable catalytic efﬁciencies (kcat/Km) of the two complexes
(Table 1). Next, experiments were carried out to evaluate the
biochemical inhibition of PRC2WT and PRC2Y111L by EI1. When
tested at 1 μM SAM, the IC50 of EI1 against PRC2111L was 3.1 μM
with H3K27Me0 and 4.2 μM with H3K27Me1, which were much
weaker compared with those of PRC2WT (0.02 and 0.009 μM for
H3K27Me0 and Me1, respectively; Supplementary Figure 4 and

0.06 μM with Me0 and Me1 substrate, respectively, at 20 μM SAM
(Table 2), but El1 was inactive against PRC2Y111L (Figure 3c). Similar
results were also observed with EPZ-6438 and compound 3
(Table 2, Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 and Supplementary Table
2). Therefore, PRC2Y111L retained the same substrate speciﬁcity as
Oncogene (2016) 558 – 566

PRC2WT but became refractory to biochemical inhibition by EZH2
inhibitors. These results suggested that restoring EZH2 WT activity
is important for resistance and tumor growth and proliferation.

we observed a Tm shift of 4.6 and 2.3◦C, respectively, which was
indicative of compound interaction with the PRC2 complexes
(Supplementary Table 3). No signiﬁcant Tm shifts were observed when
the experiment was performed using PRC2Y111L or PRC2Y641N/Y661D.
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the resistant
mutations interfere with EI1 binding to PRC2 complexes.
Restoration of cellular H3K27Me3 correlated with resistance to
EZH2 inhibitors
Western blot analysis and histone tail proﬁling were carried out to
evaluate H3K27 methylation states in sensitive and resistant cells.
As K-P cells express both EZH2 WT and Y641 mutant proteins, it
was hypothesized that H3K27Me1 and Me2 produced by EZH2 WT
would then be methylated by EZH2 Y641N to generate elevated
levels of H3K27Me3, thereby promoting tumorigenesis.9 When K-P
cells were treated with increasing doses of EI1, both H3K27Me2
and Me3 levels decreased (Figure 4a), consistent with previous
reports.13–15 Histone tail proﬁling by mass spectrometry provided
further resolution of different methylated H3 peptides
(Supplementary Figure 8). Similar to the western blot analysis,
K27Me3 methylated peptides showed the greatest decrease
following treatment with EI1 (42-fold), whereas multiple
K27Me0 and Me1 peptides were increased, suggesting accumulation in K27Me0 and Me1 states (Supplementary Figure 8). Unlike
K-P cells, the presence of Y111L and Y661D mutations in K-R10
clones suppressed the effect of EI1 on H3K27Me2 or Me3
inhibition (Figure 4a, compare lanes 8 and 9 to lane 7),
agreeing with the biochemical observations that PRC2Y111L and
PRC2Y641N/Y661D were refractory to EI1. Histone proﬁling also
showed that EI1 caused minimal decrease of H3K27Me3 peptides
in K-R10 clones compared with K-P cells (Supplementary Figure 8).

Interestingly, the presence of the Y111L mutation alone in K-R2
clones was able to signiﬁcantly limit the extent of H3K27Me3
inhibition by EI1 when compared with K-P cells (Figure 4a,
compare lanes 5 and 6 to lane 4 and lanes 2 and 3 to lane 1).
Histone proﬁling also showed that production of different
H3K27Me3 peptides was inhibited much less by EI1 compared
with K-P cells (Supplementary Figure 8). Importantly, unlike K-P
cells that showed accumulation of K27Me0 and Me1 states,
H3K27Me2 peptides showed the most pronounced accumulation
in K-R2 clones (Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure 8). As the
Y111L mutation rescued K27Me0 → Me1 and Me2 conversion in
the presence of inhibitor, the accumulation in H3K27Me2
intermediates now reﬂects the inhibition of the Y641N mutant
protein in K-R2 clones. The experiments with EI1 were also
repeated with EPZ-6438 and additional cell clones (Figure 4b and
Supplementary Figures 7A and 8). We noticed that K-R2#4 cells
showed a reduced basal level of H3K27Me2 and an increased level
of H3K27Me3 compared with K-P cells in western blot analysis
(Figures 4a and b, compare lane 4 to lane 1). PRC2Y111L exhibited
slightly reduced catalytic efﬁciency for both H3K27Me0 and Me1
substrates when compared with PRC2WT (Table 1), which could
explain this difference. Western blot analysis and histone proﬁling
also showed that the effects of EI1 and EPZ-6438 were very
speciﬁc toward H3K27 methylation; no noticeable decrease in
H3K4, K9, K36 and K79 methylation was observed (Supplementary
Figures 7B and C).
In summary, these data suggest that different H3K27 methylation states in EZH2 mutant lymphoma cells are highly inﬂuenced
by the level of EZH2 WT enzymatic activity. When EZH2 WT activity
(and the conversion of Me0 to Me1/2) is restored, it greatly limits
the ability of EZH2 inhibitors to suppress H3K27Me3. Although the
Y641N mutant protein is typically subject to inhibition by these

Figure 5. A model of resistance mechanism. (a) EZH2 WT and Y641N cooperate in cells to promote a hyper-activated state of H3K27Me3 and
tumorigenesis. EZH2 WT has a critical priming role in generating H3K27Me1 and Me2, which serve as substrates for Y641N to produce
H3K27Me3 product. (b) EZH2 inhibitors targeted both EZH2 WT and Y641N to inhibit H3K27Me3 and H3K27Me2 production and tumor cell
growth. (c) An intermediate resistant state where EZH2 WT activity (K27me0 → me1/me2) was restored by the Y111L mutation, which also
partially rescued the H3K27Me3 level and tumor cell growth. (d) Complete resistance was achieved when both EZH2 alleles were mutated and
became refractory to inhibitor.

agents, in the context of Y111L, this inhibition is to a signiﬁcant
extent abrogated. Although it was postulated that PRC2 WT and
mutant complexes cooperate to promote a hyper-activated state
of H3K27Me3 and tumorigenesis, these results provide the ﬁrst
evidence that targeting the EZH2 WT enzyme contributes most to
the decrease of K27Me3 levels, and likely also contributed
signiﬁcantly to the anti-tumor effect.
DISCUSSION
EZH2 is required to maintain the tumorigenic phenotype, which has
provided a strong rationale to develop an EZH2 inhibitor for cancer
treatment.5,20 With EZH2 inhibitors in the clinic, it is important to
understand if targeted epigenetic therapeutics such as EZH2
inhibitors will have an effective and durable anti-cancer response.
In this study, we identiﬁed two novel EZH2 mutations (Y111L
and Y661D) that were sufﬁcient to confer resistance to EZH2
inhibitors in a KARPAS422 lymphoma cell model. Both PRC2Y111L
and PRC2Y641N/Y661D complexes were enzymatically active and
retained substrate speciﬁcity identical to their predecessor
complexes, but were refractory to inhibition by three different
EZH2 inhibitors tested. Y661 resides within the SET domain in
close proximity to the SAM-binding site. Conceivably, this
mutation might directly impact inhibitor binding to EZH2. Y111
does not reside in any characterized functional domains and it is
unknown if it will interact with SAM binding. The SAM-binding
pocket was found to be absent in one study examining the X-ray
crystallographic structure of the EZH2 SET domain,21 which can
explain why EZH2 alone lacks enzymatic activity. A minimal PRC2
complex consisting of EZH2, EED and SUZ12 is required for
methyltransferase activity and the EZH2 SET domain is predicted
to undergo conformational change upon complex formation, thus
promoting SAM binding. Future efforts to obtain PRC2 complexEI1 inhibitor co-crystal structures will enable mechanistic understanding of how Y111L and Y661D mutations affect EI1 binding
to PRC2.
Oncogene (2016) 558 – 566

It has been postulated that EZH2 WT cooperates with the Y641
mutant form to promote H3K27Me3 and tumorigenesis.9 Our data
suggest that cooperation between EZH2 WT and the mutant is
also important in the development of drug resistance. In this
model, EZH2 WT carries out an important priming step to
generate K27Me1 and Me2 substrates, which are then further
methylated by the Y641N enzyme to form H3K27Me3, driving
tumorigenesis (Figure 5a). EZH2 inhibitors affect both EZH2 WT
and Y641N mutants to generate decreased levels of H3K27Me3
and H3K27Me2 and result in inhibition of cancer cell growth
(Figure 5b). When the EZH2 WT allele was mutated to become
refractory to inhibitor, the priming step was restored and,
remarkably, this change was able to limit the consequent impact
on cellular H3K27Me3, enabling a partial resistance state
(Figure 5c). Complete resistance was achieved with a second
mutation to the EZH2Y641N allele, and thus both EZH2 proteins
(EZH2Y111L and EZH2Y641N/Y661D) became refractory to inhibitors
(Figure 5d). As resistant cells were only recovered from the initial
2 μM, but not the initial 10 μM, EI1 treatment group, we
hypothesized that when cells were exposed to a higher dose of
EZH2 inhibitor beyond a threshold level, cancer cells would need
to acquire at least two simultaneous mutations (to both EZH2WT
and EZH2Y641N alleles) to develop resistance. This possibility should
be further investigated in the clinic to manage the potential
emergence of resistance. Our model also suggests that EZH2 WT
has a critical priming role to promote and maintain a high K27Me3
state in cells, so that targeting EZH2 WT activity might contribute
to most of the anti-tumor effect produced by EZH2 inhibitors.
Given that both EZH1 and EZH2 can generate K27Me1 and Me2,3,9
more comprehensive studies are needed to address if EZH1 might
also contribute to this resistance.
EZH2 inhibitors were shown to have impressive anti-tumor
effects in tumor xenograft studies12,13,16 and two studies showed
that high-dose EPZ-6438 treatment caused complete tumor
regression without tumor regrowth even after cessation of the
dosing.12,16 Interestingly, tumor regrowth was observed when a

lower dose of EPZ-6438 was used, one which initially induced
tumor stasis. Furthermore, high-dose EPZ-6438 induced partial
tumor regression in the WSU-DLCL2 xenograft model, which
seems to become refractory to inhibitor treatment at the end of
the 28-day treatment cycle.12 It will be important to perform
additional in vivo experiments to more comprehensively characterize resistance to EZH2 inhibitors in vivo.
Using in vitro models to predict resistance mechanisms has
helped the drug discovery and development effort by allowing
advance formulation of strategies to treat resistance. For example,
BRAF mutant melanoma can develop resistance to allosteric MEK
inhibitors, and random mutagenesis studies using an in vitro
model successfully predicted a number of MEK1 mutations, which
were subsequently validated in clinic.22 Clinically relevant mutations of BCR-ABL against Imatinib were faithfully recaptured using
cell line models,23 which necessitated the development of novel
BCR-ABL inhibitors to bypass Imatinib resistance.24 Our study
demonstrated that on-target mutations of EZH2 can occur to
create resistance to EZH2 inhibitors. These results have at least
two important implications for drug development and the clinical
translation of EZH2 inhibitors. First, monitoring secondary mutations of EZH2 in clinical settings of primary and acquired
resistance to treatment will be warranted. Second, development
of novel EZH2 inhibitors against potential resistance mutations
should be investigated in advance. As the current EZH2 inhibitors
all act through a SAM-competitive mechanism to inhibit EZH2,
and the resistant mutations showed cross-resistance to all SAMcompetitive inhibitors, SAM non-competitive inhibitors might be
exploited to bypass resistance. SAM non-competitive inhibitors
have been reported for histone methyltransferases such as G9a
and SYMD2.25,26 These inhibitors affected the binding of histone
peptide substrates to inhibit the enzymatic activity. Recently, Kim
et al 27 also reported an EZH2-EED stapled peptide that disrupted
the PRC2 complex and inhibited its enzymatic activity. By
combining different types of EZH2 inhibitors, it might be possible
to achieve a more durable and effective anti-tumor response by
preventing the development of resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, cell growth assay and western blot
Karpas422 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY, USA; cat.#11875) with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA; cat.
#SH30071.03) in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. K-R2 and
K-R10 cells were cultured in growth media supplemented with 2 and 10 μM
EI1, respectively. Single clones were isolated using an ARIA II cell sorter (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Viable cell number was determined
by Vi-CELL (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Cell number was
recorded and calculated with a splitting ratio to adjust for total cell
numbers. Details of the cellular assays and antibody information are
described in the Supplementary Information.

Biochemical assays
PRC2 complexes were generated and puriﬁed using the baculovirus
system as previously described.14,30 The liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry assay detecting SAH was performed as previously
described.14,30 Details of the biochemical assays is described in the
Supplementary Information.
Inhibitors were tested in a 12-point, threefold dose–response methyltransferase assay. For WT and Y111L enzymes, unmethylated and
monomethylated histone peptide substrates were used. For Y641N and
Y641N/Y661D mutants, monomethylated and dimethylated histone
peptide substrates were used. 30 μM peptide substrates were used
and SAM was present at 1 μM or 20 μM. 16 nM of each enzyme was
used and reaction was carried out for 1 h. Percent inhibitions were
calculated and plotted against logarithmic concentration of inhibitors, and
data were ﬁtted in the following model using GraphPad Prism v6.02.

Y = %inhibition and X = log [inhibitor].

Differential scanning ﬂuorimetry
PRC2 complexes (1 mM), SYPRO-orange (5 × ; Invitrogen; cat. #S6650), and
Reaction Buffer (1X Tris-Buffered Saline, pH 8.0, 0.25 mM TCEP, ± 100 μM
SAM) were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μM EI1 with a
temperature ramp from 25 to 85 °C with a 0.5 °C increment every 30 s.
Fluorescence intensity was monitored using the Stratagene Mx3005P
thermocycler (Agilent Technologies). The thermal transition (Tm) corresponds to the inﬂection point of the transition curve (ﬂuorescence unit =
f(T)) and was calculated as the maximum of the ﬁrst derivative. All
reactions were performed in triplicate.

Structural modeling
To examine the structure-function impact of the mutated residues, a
homology model of the EZH2 SET domain was derived from the published
crystal structure of the SET domain of GLP (EHMT1, PDB: 3HNA, resolution
1.5 A).31 Y641 and Y661D mutations were then manually introduced into
the EZH2 structure model and locally minimized with Molsoft ICM. The
ﬁnal all-atom RMSD (root-mean-square deviation; original GLP to mutant
EZH2) was o0.8 Å.
