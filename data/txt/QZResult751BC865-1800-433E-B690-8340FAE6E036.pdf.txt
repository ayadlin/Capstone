Abstract
mTOR is a central mediator of cancer cell growth, but it also directs immune cell differentiation and function.
On this basis, we had explored the hypothesis that mTOR inhibition can enhance cancer immunotherapy. Here,
we report that a combination of aCD40 agonistic antibody and the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitory
drug AZD8055 elicited synergistic antitumor responses in a model of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In contrast
to the well-established mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, AZD8055 increased the infiltration, activation, and proliferation of CD8þ T cells and natural killer cells in liver metastatic foci when combined with the CD40 agonist.
AZD8055/aCD40-treated mice also display an increased incidence of matured macrophages and dendritic cells
compared with that achieved in mice by aCD40 or AZD8055 treatment alone. We found that the combination
treatment also increased macrophage production of TNFa, which played an indispensable role in activation of
the observed antitumor immune response. Levels of Th1 cytokines, including interleukin 12, IFN-g, TNFa, and
the Th1-associated chemokines RANTES, MIG, and IP-10 were each elevated significantly in the livers of mice
treated with the combinatorial therapy versus individual treatments. Notably, the AZD8055/aCD40-induced
antitumor response was abolished in IFN-g / and CD40/ mice, establishing the reliance of the combination
therapy on host IFN-g and CD40 expression. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept that, unlike
rapamycin, the ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 can contribute with aCD40 treatment to
trigger a restructuring of the tumor immune microenvironment to trigger regressions of an established
metastatic cancer. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4074–84. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
mTOR plays a central role in regulation of cell growth and
proliferation by monitoring nutrient availability, cellular
energy levels, oxygen levels, and mitogenic signals (1). It
exists in 2 distinct complexes—mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1)
and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is characterized
by the classic features of mTOR as a nutrient/energy/redox
sensor and regulator of protein synthesis (1); mTORC2 has
been shown to function as an important regulator of the
actin cytoskeleton and Akt activation (2, 3). The mTOR
pathway is dysregulated in many kinds of human diseases,
especially certain cancers, which suggests it could be a good

target for cancer therapy (4, 5). Rapamycin and its pharmacologic analogs (e.g., sirolimus and RAD001) are preferentially effective at blocking mTORC1, which could also have
the unwanted side effect of disengaging the mTORC1 negative feedback loop, thereby causing PI3K–AKT overactivation and impairment of overall antitumor efficacy (6).
Therefore, ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR kinase,
which target both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (7) and more
profoundly inhibit of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1
(8, 9), are anticipated to have broader application and,
perhaps, increased activity when used in combination with
other antitumor agents.
Besides direct effects on tumor cells, studies in the past
few years have reported a broad spectrum of regulatory
effects on both innate and adaptive immune cells by mTOR
inhibition (10). Rapamycin exerts its potent immunosuppressive effects through restricting proliferation of T cells
and natural killer (NK) cells (11, 12) and inhibiting differentiation, maturation, and function of innate immune cells
in vitro, including dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (13–
15). These types of effects could be presumed to impair
antitumor immune responses. However, rapamycinmediated inhibition of mTOR can also cause an increase
in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as
interleukin 12 (IL-12), IL-23, and IL-6 by innate immune

cells, and can also decrease the production of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 following LPS stimulation.
Moreover, even though rapamycin can act directly on T
cells to suppress their proliferation and effector function, it
also has been shown to increase the ability of LPS-stimulated
monocytes to prime Th1 cells in vitro (16). Finally, rapamycin-induced autophagy has been reported to increase antigen presentation in DCs in vivo (17). These immune
modulating effects of mTOR inhibition suggest mTORinhibiting drugs could synergize with more traditional
immune modulators for induction of antitumor responses.
CD40 is a TNF receptor family member that plays a critical
role in both humoral and cellular immune responses (18). It
has a broad pattern of expression, including antigen-presenting cells (APC), B cells, endothelial cells, and some tumor cells
(18). Agonistic aCD40 antibodies, a potent mimic of the
natural ligand CD154, have been shown to promote T-cell–
mediated immunity in treatment of cancers in experimental
animal models through activation of APCs (19, 20). In some
tumor models, the effector cells were shown to be CD8þ T cells
and macrophages, and it has been reported that a stimulatory
aCD40 antibody indirectly activated NK cells by IL-12 secreted
by CD40þ DCs and monocytes, which resulted in significant
antitumor activity (21). The successes achieved with agonistic
aCD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in preclinical models
has led to clinical evaluation of anti-human CD40 mAbs as a
potential treatment for cancer (22, 23).
In this study, we hypothesized that combining the ATPcompetitive inhibitor AZD8055 with aCD40 antibody would
induce more efficient antitumor effects by a combination of
direct tumor killing and subsequent release of tumor-associated antigens to APCs and coincident modulation of
immune cell functions in vivo. The results of our study
show that in a syngeneic mouse metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) model, AZD8055 and aCD40 synergize for
tumor regression by activating macrophages and DCs and
inducing strong Th1 immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.

(I-A/I-E; clone M5/114.15.2), anti-mouse CD69 (clone
H1.2F3), and anti-mouse IL-12 (p40/p70; clone C15.6). Monoclonal antibodies obtained from eBiosciences included antimouse F4/80 (clone BM8), anti-mouse NKp46 (clone 29A1.4),
anti-mouse CD11c (clone N418), NKG2D (clone CX5), antimouse IFN-g (clone XMG1.2), and anti-mouse TNFa (clone
MP6-XT22). Pacific orange–conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45
(clone 30-F11) was purchased from Invitrogen.
Mice and tumor cells
BALB/c wild-type mice were obtained from the Animal
Production Area of the National Cancer Institute-Frederick
(NCI-Frederick) Cancer Research and Development Center
(Frederick, MD). BALB/c IFN-g KO (GKO) mice were obtained
from the Jackson Laboratories and then bred at NCI-Frederick. Mutant alleles were confirmed by PCR genotyping. All
mice were maintained in a dedicated pathogen-free environment and used between 7 and 10 weeks of age in accordance
with an approved NCI-Frederick Institutional Animal Care
and Use protocol. For tumor cell lines used in this study, Renca
(murine renal carcinoma) was obtained from Dr. Pontes (25);
the streptozotocin-induced RCC cell line was developed by our
lab (26); and the B16-F10 mouse melanoma was obtained from
Dr. Josh Fidler (1982). All cell lines were tested by using the
molecular testing of biological materials assay for murine
cells in 2007. Tumor cell lines were maintained in RPMI
1640 medium with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
1nonessential amino acids, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate.
For studies in mice, Renca tumors were maintained by serial
intraperitoneal (i.p.) passage in syngeneic mice. Enhanced
green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-Renca was prepared by
transducing Renca cells with lentiviral pLenti6/EF1a/eGFP
expression vector in the presence of 5 mg/mL polybrene
(Sigma), which was created by using Gateway Technology
(Invitrogen) by site-specific recombination between pDEST/
eGFP, pDEST-50 -EFIa promoter, and pLenti6/R4R2/V5—
DEST vectors. RENCA/eGFP clones were selected by adding
5 mg/mL blasticidin to the RPMI media and then confirming
more than 90% eGFP expression by flow cytometry.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
AZD8055 was supplied by AstraZeneca. Rapamycin was
purchased from LC Labs. For in vitro studies, AZD8055 was
prepared as a 10 mmol/L stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide.
For studies in mice, AZD8055 and rapamycin were prepared in
sterile water with 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC),
0.1% polysorbate 80, and one-third of overall final volume of
glass beads and then shaken overnight to generate a homogenous suspension. Agonist rat anti-mouse CD40 (clone
FGK115B3) was purified from ascites, as previously described
(24). Endotoxin was less than 1 EU/mg antibody, as determined
by chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate kit (Cambrex).
Purified rat IgG (immunoglobulin G) was purchased from
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Monoclonal antibodies obtained from BD PharMingen included anti-mouse CD3e
(clone 145-2C11, clone 500A2), anti-mouse CD8 (clone 53-6.7),
anti-mouse CD86 (clone GL-1), anti-mouse MHC Class II

Liver tumor model
Renca cells were injected intrasplenically at a dose of 0.4 
105 cells (Renca) or 2  105 (GFP-Renca) on day 0, and
splenectomies were done on all mice immediately after tumor
injection. Mice were then treated with vehicle control for
AZD8055 (0.5% HPMC, 0.1% polysorbate 80, oral gavage)
and IgG control for CD40 antibody (i.p.), CD40 antibody
(65 mg, i.p.), AZD8055 (20 mg/kg weight, oral gavage), or
rapamycin (2 mg/kg weight, oral gavage), according to the
schedules outlined for each experiment. All mice were then
euthanized on day 17, livers were harvested into Bouin's
solution, and the number of tumor nodules was counted by
using a dissecting microscope.
Histology assay
Livers were dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin and then embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at
5 mm in thickness, deparaffinized in xylene, and serially

dehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Sections
were stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined under light microscopy to detect lymphocyte infiltration
and evaluate tissue structure.
Cell depletion in vivo
CD8þ T cells were depleted in vivo using i.p. injections of rat
anti-mouse CD8 (clone 19–178), starting on day 2 and continuing 3 times weekly (90% depletion). Control mice
received 10% normal rat serum. To deplete NK cells, mice
were given rabbit anti-asialo-GM1 i.v. (Wako Chemicals) on
days 2, 4, 6, 9, and 13 after tumor cell implantation in the liver
(90% depletion). Control mice received 10% normal rabbit
serum. For macrophage depletion, mice were injected i.v. with
100 mL of clodronate liposomes on days -1, 2, 6, 10, and 14 after
tumor cell implantation into the liver (90% depletion).
Clodronate liposomes were obtained from Dr. N. van Rooijen
(Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands). PBS-containing
liposomes were used as a control.
Isolation of liver leukocytes
On day 14 or 17, mice were euthanized and the livers flushed
with 10 mL of HBSS through the portal vein, removed, and
homogenized by using a GentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi
Biotec) and then digested in RPMI containing 5% fetal calf
serum, 250 U/mL type IV collagenase (Invitrogen), 100 mg/mL
DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 mmol/L EDTA
(pH 8.0), at 37 C for 20 minutes. The homogenate was then
processed in a tissue stomacher-80 (Seward) for 30 seconds,
washed with HBSS (BioWhittaker), and resuspended in 40%
Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia) in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's
medium (BioWhittaker). The suspension was underlaid with
80% Percoll and centrifuged for 25 minutes at 1,000  g.
Leukocytes were collected from the interphase, filtered with a
70-mm Nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences), washed, and
enumerated on a Sysmex KX-21 (Roche) automated cell
counter.
Flow cytometric analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was done on liver leukocytes
according to a previously described procedure (27). Briefly,
cells (1  106) were incubated in cell staining buffer (0.1%
bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide) containing 250
mg/mL 2.4G2 ascites for 25 minutes. Cells were stained with
diluted fluorescently conjugated antibodies for 30 minutes
followed by 2 washes in staining buffer. Labeled cells were
analyzed on an LSR-II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
For Ki67 staining, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-mouse
anti-human Ki67 set (BD PharMingen) was used according
to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. For IFN-g intracellular staining, hepatic mononuclear cells (MNC) were
restimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (5 ng/
mL)/Ionomycin (1 mg/mL) for 4 hours and 1 mg/mL Brefeldin
A (GolgiPlug) for another 5 hours at 37 C in 5% CO2. For the
detection for TNFa and IL-12, the restimulation conditions
were 3 hours for LPS (100 ng/mL) plus 5 hours for brefeldin
A, and 2 hours for LPS (1 mg/mL) plus 10 hours for brefeldin
A, respectively. After surface protein staining, cells were

fixed by using the Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (PharMingen)
and then stained with optimally titered anti-mouse IFN-g,
TNFa, and IL-12.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Livers obtained on day 17 were placed in RNALater
(Ambion). Total RNA was isolated from liver homogenates
by using TRIzol (Invitrogen), precipitated, and then reverse
transcribed (Applied Biosystems). RT2 real-time SYBR Green/
Rox PCR master mix and RT2 Profiler PCR array were used for
murine cytokines and chemokines detection (SuperArray).
Genes of interest were subsequently examined with greater
sensitivity by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR by using
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and the ABI Prism 7300
Detection System (TaqMan; Applied Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Primer sets for mouse
included IL-12(p35; Mm00434169), TNFa (Mm00443258),
IFN-g (Mm99999071), CCL5 (Mm01302428), CXCL10
(Mm00445235), and CXCL9 (Mm00434946; Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to the level of the
b-actin housekeeping gene. Data were analyzed by using the
DDCt method (28) and expressed as a fold change in mRNA
expression relative to control values.
Statistical analysis
Values of P were determined by unpaired student's t test.
The value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

AZD8055, but not rapamycin, induces enhanced
antitumor immune responses in vivo when combined
with aCD40
On the basis of reports that AZD8055 induces a profound
growth inhibition, autophagy, and cell death in many human
tumor cell lines (29, 30) and our previous study showing that
Renca tumor cells express functional CD40 (24), we first
tested the direct effect of AZD8055 and aCD40 on the
survival of Renca tumor cells in vitro. We found that only
AZD8055 inhibited Renca cell growth, whereas aCD40 could
neither inhibit Renca growth directly nor enhance the
inhibitory ability of AZD8055 (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the
antitumor effect in vivo, we designed and evaluated a variety
of different schedules for the administration of AZD8055 in
combination with aCD40 (Fig. 1B), in an experimental
Renca liver metastasis model. The results showed that
priming the immune system with aCD40 prior to the use
of AZD8055 which directly targets the tumor cells (Fig. 1B
schedule a) was the most active approach among the
schedules utilized (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest administration of AZD8055 before or at the same time aCD40
delivery might suppress some immune functions and
thereby impair the immune-priming function of subsequently delivered aCD40. Therefore, schedule a (aCD40
prior to AZD8055) which yielded the best overall antitumor
effect was used in all subsequent studies, although significant tumor reduction was also observed with each of the
other schedules tested.

necessary for the antitumor response in vivo. We also hypothesized that a major contribution of mTOR inhibitor–induced
tumor apoptosis would be the liberation of tumor antigen
from killed cells, which could further promote maturation and
T-cell–priming function of APCs in response to aCD40. Therefore, we expected similar enhanced antitumor effects to be
achieved when aCD40 was combined with different mTOR
inhibitors. However, when aCD40 was combined with the
classical mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, the antitumor responses
achieved by the combination were indistinguishable from
those achieved by rapamycin alone (Fig. 2A). Importantly,
we observed a remarkable infiltration of CD8þ T cells, DCs,
and macrophages into the livers of AZD8055/aCD40-treated
mice, but not in the group treated with rapamycin/aCD40
(Fig. 2B), when compared with either vehicle control or aCD40
alone treated groups. These results showed that the AZD8055
ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor, but not rapamycin,
induced enhanced antitumor activities when combined with
aCD40, suggesting substantially different mechanisms of
action on the immune system for AZD8055, compared with
rapamycin.
We also investigated the antitumor effects of AZD8055/
aCD40 in several other tumor models. By using the streptozotocin-induced, CD40 positive, RCC cell line that we characterized previously (26), we observed that AZD8055/aCD40
exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo that was comparable to that observed for Renca (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
We also used the CD40 negative B16 melanoma cell line to
potentially address whether tumor-associated CD40 expression might contribute to the aCD40-mediated immune or
antitumor effects. In contrast to the 2 RCC models previously
described, neither AZD8055 nor aCD40, or the combination of
AZD8055/aCD40, had any appreciable ability to reduce the
number of B16 tumor nodules in the liver (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). It is noteworthy, however, that regardless of the
tumor model, the AZD8055/aCD40 combination still elicited
significant immune cell infiltration in vivo. Taken together, it
seems that RCC, may be particularly amenable to the
AZD8055/aCD40 combination therapy.
AZD8055/aCD40 induces activation and proliferation
of CD8þ T cells and NK cells
To further delineate the immune effects induced by
AZD8055 and aCD40, we examined the livers of treated mice
and found that although aCD40 alone induced some recruitment of immune cells to the liver, aCD40 plus AZD8055
induced a more pronounced lymphocytic infiltration. In addition, there was a pronounced localization of leukocytes
around tumor foci in response to aCD40/AZD8055 whereas
few leukocytes were found in or around tumor foci in the
vehicle control and AZD8055-treated groups (Fig. 3A). To
determine the activation of CD8þ T cells and NK cells, hepatic
MNCs of tumor-bearing mice were isolated on day 14 and
subjected to flow cytometric analysis. AZD8055 plus aCD40
induced a significant elevation in the expression of CD69 and
NKG2D on CD8þ T cells (Fig. 3B). Among NK cells, CD69þ and
NKGD2þ cell frequencies were also moderately increased in
the combination-treated group (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, there

4078

Cancer Res; 71(12) June 15, 2011

was a notable upregulation of Ki67 protein in both NK cells
and CD8þ T cells from AZD8055/aCD40-treated mice
(Fig. 3C), suggesting that the expansion of these cell types
might be at least partially due to proliferation. Moreover, we
also found significant induction of IFN-g expression in CD8þ T
cells and NK cells derived from AZD8055/aCD40-treated mice
(Fig. 3D).
AZD8055/aCD40 matures and activates macrophages
and DCs
Because AZD8055 could significantly increase the frequency
of macrophages and DCs in liver when combined with aCD40
(Fig. 2B), we next investigated the effect of AZD8055/aCD40 on
the status of antigen-presenting DCs and macrophages in vivo.
By using eGFP-expressing Renca cells, we detected increased
efficiency of processing of tumor-derived antigen by macrophages and DCs in AZD8055/aCD40-treated mice (Fig. 4A). In
addition, the maturation markers CD86 and MHC II were
significantly upregulated on macrophages and DCs (Fig. 4B).
Increased production of IL-12 was also observed in macrophages and DCs from the AZD8055-alone group and in macrophages from the combination group (Fig. 4C). In addition,
TNFa production was only significantly induced in macrophages by AZD8055/aCD40 treatment (Fig. 4D). Overall, these
results showed that macrophages and DCs were matured and
activated in the AZD8055/aCD40-treated group.
CD8þ T cells, NK cells, and macrophages all contribute
to AZD8055/aCD40-induced antitumor responses
We next used antibodies to deplete CD8þ T cells and NK
cells before AZD8055/aCD40 treatment and found that depletion of either cell type could partially mitigate the antitumor
response. The depletion of both cell types could substantially
reduce the antitumor response to the level achieved with
AZD8055 alone (Fig. 5A), suggesting that CD8þ T cells and NK
cells might contribute to the enhanced antitumor effect
induced by the combination treatment. Furthermore, by using
macrophage depletion, we showed a dramatic loss of antitumor activity by AZD8055/aCD40, thereby confirming a
unique and indispensable role of macrophages in the antitumor immune responses induced by AZD8055/aCD40 combination treatment (Fig. 5B).
Antitumor immune responses induced by AZD8055/
aCD40 depend on Th1 cytokines
Because we observed a significant degree of infiltration and
activation of immune cells in the AZD8055/aCD40-treated
tumor-bearing mice, we hypothesized that this process would
be associated with increased levels of cytokines and chemokines induced by AZD8055/aCD40. Therefore, we analyzed
liver tissue from treated mice for gene expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR). AZD8055/aCD40 treatment significantly
increased Th1 cytokines and Th1-associated chemokine
expression in the liver, including IL-12, IFN-g, TNFa, CCL5/
RANTES, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL9/MIG (Fig. 6A), whereas
aCD40 alone only slightly induced IL-12, CCL5, and CXCL9
production, as compared with AZD8055 alone and vehicle
control groups. Because of the high levels of IFN-g production

and previous studies showing the role of IFN-g in this Renca
model (31), we evaluated its role in the in vivo therapy. As
shown in Figure 6B, AZD8055/aCD40-mediated antitumor
responses were completely abolished in IFN-g KO mice as
was as the activation of CD8þ T cells and NK cells (Fig. 6C).
When the number of CD8þ T cells was evaluated, no significant differences between WT mice and IFN-g KO mice
were observed (Fig. 6C), which implied that IFN-g might have
no effect on survival and proliferation of CD8þ T cells in this
model. The previously observed increase in macrophages was
also dependent on IFN-g (Fig. 6D), but no impairment of DC
priming was detected in IFN-g KO mice (data not shown). In
addition to its immunoregulatory roles, we also found that
IFN-g could directly enhance inhibition of tumor cell growth
by AZD8055 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Discussion
Inhibitors of the mTOR pathway have been used individually and in combination with a variety of cancer therapeutic
agents, including chemotherapy, IGF-IR inhibitors, and trastuzumab (32–34). Our article outlines an innovative immunotherapeutic approach combining a novel ATP-competitive
mTOR inhibitor with an agonist aCD40 antibody in an
experimental model of metastatic RCC. We showed that
combining the mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor AZD8055 with
aCD40 induced significant infiltration, proliferation, and activation of CD8þ T cells and NK cells in the liver. Th1 cytokines
and related chemokines were also significantly elevated by the
combination treatment over levels achieved by either agent
alone. In addition, the frequency of activated macrophages

AZD8055/aCD40 treatment, which facilitated a transition of
the tumor microenvironment from predominantly immunosuppressive to one that is strongly Th1 in composition.

we have observed by using AZD8055. Furthermore, we show
that the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin was able to modestly
inhibit tumor growth to a similar extent as did AZD8055 alone,
but unlike AZD8055, it was unable to synergize with aCD40 for
enhanced induction of immunomodulatory responses.
Although the efficacy of AZD8055 as a single agent was similar
to that of rapamycin alone, it remains unclear whether this is
due to the suboptimal concentrations of the inhibitors used in
our study or whether there are differences with respect to
efficacious dose range with mTORC1/2 versus mTORC1 inhibitors. Nevertheless, our data makes clear that the distinctive
benefits of AZD8055, when used in combination with aCD40,
cannot be simply attributed to quantitatively increased antigen release by AZD8055-induced tumor destruction that could
simply contribute to further maturation of aCD40-primed
APC and promotion of subsequent Th1 antitumor responses.
Instead, when compared with rapamycin, the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor more dramatically inhibited protein
synthesis and induced G1 cell-cycle arrest in several cancer
cell lines not only by targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2
equally, but also by more completely inhibiting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, which causes more profound inhibition of

www.aacrjournals.org

mTORC1 (8, 9, 36, 37). These different effects on tumor cells
or endothelial cells of AZD8055 may result in qualitatively
different tumor-derived products, including distinct cytokine
and chemokines, which could therefore contribute indirectly
to differences in immune cell recruitment and activation.
Another possible explanation for the increase of DCs and
macrophages induced by AZD8055 but not rapamycin in the
liver is that 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation caused by AZD8055
may contribute to the myeloid differentiation program and
thereby alter some biological functions of subsets of mononuclear phagocytes (38). Moreover, we found IFN-g played
important roles in the combination therapy through both
directly mediating antitumor response and indirectly regulating immune cell survival and functions. The induction of key
IFN-g–inducible proteins ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene
15) and CXCL10 that mediate IFN responses are enhanced in
4E-BP1(/) mouse epithelial fibroblasts, suggesting that
AZD8055 inhibition on 4E-BP1 activity may exhibit important
regulatory effects in the generation of IFN responses (39).
Recently, divergent effects of rapamycin versus ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors have been described for tumor cells (6).
Our studies underscore the need for additional investigation

as to the different roles these agents play in immune system
modulation, particularly within certain tumor microenvironments, which may inform new approaches to the use of these
agents for treatment of cancer or autoimmune diseases, or for
transplantation.
Recent studies documented several promising features of
mTOR inhibition that may enhance antitumor immunity
(10). First, mTOR inhibition can promote IL-12 production
by DCs in the presence of LPS (16). By using intracellular
staining, we observed only a slight enhancement of LPSinduced IL-12 production by macrophages and DCs from
AZD8055-treated mice. Thus, our data are more consistent
with a mechanism whereby the increased level of IL-12 in the
combination treatment group is mainly due to an overall
increase in the number of IL-12–producing macrophages
and DCs present in the liver. Second, mTOR inhibition
enhances antigen presentation through induction of autophagy (17). Consistently, we also found upregulation of CD86
and MHC II expression and presentation of tumor-derived
GFP protein in DCs and macrophages in AZD8055/aCD40treated mice, which would be expected to contribute to
more effective T-cell–mediated responses. The upregulation
of NKG2D expression on CD8þ T cells and NK cells by
AZD8055/aCD40 treatment may also contribute to their
cytotoxic activity against tumors (40, 41). Rapamycin has
also been reported to promote CD8þ memory T-cell differentiation (42). However, we found that most CD8þ T cells
induced by AZD8055/aCD40 in our model were CD8þ
effector T cells (CD44high, CD62Llow, data not shown). On
the other hand, although mTOR inhibitors are generally
considered to have an overall immunosuppressive effect
(13, 43, 44), we observed no significant reduction in the
number of immune cells (Fig. 2B), the activation, or proliferation of CD8 and NK cells (Fig. 3) as well as the
expression of maturation markers by DCs (Fig. 4), when
results from AZD8055 or rapamycin alone were compared
with the vehicle control group. We also observed an
increased number of Tregs in the livers of AZD8055/
aCD40-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S5), that is consistent with the earlier observation that mTOR inhibition
can promote Treg differentiation (45). Despite the presence
of Treg cells, enhanced proliferation and activation of CD8þ
T cells and NK cells was observed following combination
treatment. Therefore, we conclude that the immunosuppressive effects of mTOR inhibitors are not dominant in the
setting of their combination with powerful immunotherapeutic stimulants such as aCD40.
Although systemic administration of agonist aCD40 has
been used in cancer patients to boost CD8þ T cell or NK
cell responses to tumors and to break peripheral selftolerance (21, 46), there is also evidence that it can induce
immune suppression in some settings of tumor growth or
virus infection (47, 48). We did detect transient infiltration
of CD8þ T cells, NK cells, and macrophages into liver
during the early stage of single agent aCD40 treatment,
and long-term treatment accelerated the deletion of all
these antitumor immune cells (data not shown). We propose that persisting functions of CD8þ T cells restored in

4082

Cancer Res; 71(12) June 15, 2011

the AZD8055/aCD40 treatment group result from the
enhanced priming by an increased frequency of APCs
acquiring antigens derived from AZD8055-triggered tumor
destruction, and activated by proinflammatory cytokines
elevated by the combination treatment (47). The mechanism by which AZD8055 administration prevents the loss of
macrophages in vivo induced by long-term aCD40 treatment still needs further investigation. In addition, possible
proangiogenic effects may result in some settings following
CD40 engagement which could be perceived as a limitation
of aCD40 for cancer therapy (49). However, we found
AZD8055/aCD40 had an overall antiangiogenic effect (data
not shown), which could also contribute to an overall
antitumor and antimetastatic effect. One of our previous
studies showed that direct ligation of CD40 on Renca
tumor cells triggered cytokine production, leukocyte
recruitment, and antitumor responses which could be
independent of host CD40 expression (24). In this study,
we used Renca-bearing CD40 KO mice to show that Rencaassociated CD40 expression was not sufficient for the
antitumor effects of this combination therapy (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, we also observed significant
expansion of the immune system by using the CD40 negative B16 tumor cell line, which further suggests that tumorderived CD40 expression is not sufficient for immune
responses induced by aCD40-based therapy. However,
because the antitumor effects of AZD8055/aCD40 were
also lost in the B16 tumor model (Supplementary
Fig. S3B), we cannot exclude the possibility that CD40
ligation by tumor cells contributes to enhanced immune
sensitivity of some tumors. Future studies should be aimed
at addressing the striking sensitivity that RCC seems to
have for the combined effects of mTOR and CD40 targeted
agents. Ongoing studies will also explore the sensitivities of
other tumor models toward mTOR and/or CD40-based
combination therapies.
In conclusion, our study shows that combining the ATPcompetitive mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 with aCD40 induced
strongly enhanced Th1 antitumor responses through the
recruitment and activation of macrophages and DCs in
the tumor microenvironment. These events were critical
for the overall enhanced antitumor effects of this novel
combination because depletion of macrophages substantially reduced the overall antitumor effects. Overall, these
results show novel immune-stimulating effects that contribute to enhanced antitumor activity, suggesting this combination may also distinctively restructure the tumor
microenvironment of RCC in a manner that favors tumor
regression.
