BACKGROUND: Sorafenib currently sets the new standard for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been suggested that
Asian patients with HCC have increased susceptibility to hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) related to sorafenib therapy. The authors
investigated the association between sorafenib-induced HFSR and genetic polymorphisms in Korean patients with HCC. METHODS:
For this prospective cohort study, the authors enrolled 59 consecutive patients with intermediate stage HCC from 5 centers in Korea.
All patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Genotyping was performed on a total of 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 candidate genes (minor allelic frequency 5%). Serum levels of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays before therapy and 1 month after therapy. RESULTS: During a median treatment period of 18 months, 55 patients (93%)
developed sorafenib-induced HFSR, including grade 1 reactions in 15 patients, grade 2 reactions in 27 patients, and grade 3 reaction
in 13 patients. The SNPs TNF-a 308GG, VEGF 94GG, VEGF 1991CC, VEGF IVS3-28CC, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family-polypeptide A9 (UGT1A9) IVS1-37431AA were associated significantly with the development of high-grade (grade 2 or 3)
HFSR in univariate analysis (P < .05). In multivariate analysis, the SNPs VEGF 1991CC (odds ratio, 45.7), TNF-a 308GG (odds ratio,
44.1), and UGT1A9 IVS1-37431AA (odds ratio, 18.7) were identified as independent risk factors for the development of high-grade
HFSR (P ¼ .01, P ¼ .02, and P ¼ .02, respectively). He serum TNF-a level measured 1 month after sorafenib therapy was correlated significantly with the development of high-grade HFSR (odds ratio, 3.56; P ¼ .026). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the incidence of
HFSR may have been caused by ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms of the TNF-a, VEGF, and UGT1A9 genes, especially in

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cancer. Approximately 14,000 patients develop HCC annually in Korea,1 and >50% of patients with HCC receive palliative treatments only, including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), systemic chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.2,3 Sorafenib, a dual Raf kinase/vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor, currently sets the new standard for the first-line treatment of advanced HCC.4-6
Recent Asian and Western trials have indicated that Asian patients appear to be more susceptible to hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) related to sorafenib treatment.4-8 However, little is understood regarding the mechanism underlying HFSR
and interracial difference in sorafenib-induced toxicity.
Sorafenib-induced HFSR, which is a common side effect observed in many clinical trials, often is serious and may
lead to compromised efficacy because of dose reduction or discontinuation.7-9 Therefore, early detection and management
of HFSR is imperative to allow patients to continue life-prolonging therapy with minimal morbidity.
The safety profiles of sorafenib in the Asia-Pacific study5 and in the Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment
Randomized Protocol (SHARP) study4 were similar. However, there were significant disparities in the incidences of some
sorafenib-related adverse events of any grade in both studies. It is noteworthy that the incidence of HFSR was greater in
the Asia-Pacific study compared with the SHARP study (45.0% vs 21.2%, respectively), in contrast to the incidence of

diarrhea (25.5% vs 39.1%, respectively). The source
of these disparities remains unclear but may be caused
by physiologic deference associated with ethnicity,
including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A9
(UGT1A9).8,9 Also, it has been suggested that VEGF
and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) are overexpressed in patients with HCC, and the VEGF pathway is important in the causation of HFSR.8,10-13
Thus, further investigations on the genetic association
between sorafenib-induced HFSR and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGF, TNF-a,
CYP3A4, and UGT1A9 are warranted to determine
the risk of sorafenib-induced HFSR. In this study, we
investigated frequencies of SNPs of the genes related
to drug metabolism and tumor angiogenesis in ethnically homogenous Korean patients who had HCC
with the objective of identifying their probable function as biomarkers of HFSR susceptibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In total, 59 patients with intermediate stage HCC who
were enrolled on the Study in Asia of the Combination of
TACE with Sorafenib in Patients with Hepatocellular
Carcinoma (START) trial from 5 medical centers in
Korea were included in the current study (Table 1). The
inclusion criteria were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 or 1, a Child-Pugh score
7 (Child class A or B), and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B disease (intermediate stage; ie, multinodular, asymptomatic tumors without extrahepatic
spread). Patients were excluded if they had an infiltrative
type of HCC or vascular involvement. Patients also were
excluded if they had hypertension, serious nonhealing
wounds, and serious acute or chronic illness.
All patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily in
combination with TACE. Repeated TACE was performed at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks, and sorafenib was
administered continuously with dose interruptions 4 days
before and after TACE. Treatment-related toxicity was
graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version
3.0. Tumor response was assessed according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. We
collected peripheral blood samples from each patient 1
week before therapy to obtain serum and genomic DNA
samples. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center, and written
informed consent was obtained from all patients who provided blood and tissue samples.

Genotyping of Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms

Peripheral blood samples were drawn into serum separator tubes, centrifuged at 1800g for 10 minutes, and then
stored at 80 C. Genomic DNA was prepared from
stored buffy coat that had been extracted from peripheral
blood samples using a nucleic acid isolation device (the
QuickGene-mini80; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).
Genotyping was performed on a total of 49 SNPs
with minor-allele frequency >5% in 8 candidate genes
that are involved in angiogenesis and sorafenib metabolism (UGT1A9, UGT1A1, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, TNF-a,
VEGF, insulin-like growth factor-2 [IGF2], and hypoxiainducible factor-1a [HIF-1a]) using the GenomeLab
SNPstream genotyping platform (Beckman Coulter, Inc.,
Fullerton, Calif) and its accompanying SNPstream software suite. The 49 primer pairs used in the multiplex polymerase chain reaction and the single-base extension
primers were designed for the specific SNPs and flanking
sequences in a homogenous reaction using Web-based
software (provided at: http://www.autoprimer.com/; September 2009; Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The 49 individual
137

Original Article

SNPs were identified by their position and fluorescent
color in each well according to the position of the tagged
oligonucleotides. Genotype data were generated on the
basis of the relative fluorescent intensities for each SNP.
Graphic review and operator adjustment of the genotype
clusters were performed to refine fluorescent cutoff values.
Serum VEGF and TNF-a Measurement

Serum VEGF and TNF-a concentrations were measured
quantitatively using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kit (Quantikine Human Immunoassay;
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The genotype frequencies were checked by consistency
among normal controls with those expected from HardyWeinberg equilibrium. Genotype and allele frequencies
were compared between groups using the chi-square test or
the Fisher exact probability test, as appropriate. Gene frequencies were determined by gene counting. A P value <
.05 was considered statistically significant. Odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
if the chi-square test or Fisher exact test was significant. For
multivariate analysis, binary logistic regression analysis was
performed to determine the most discriminating factor for
the development of high-grade (grade 2 or 3) HFSR. P values were corrected by multiplying by the number of possible genotypes of single SNPs (Bonferroni correction). All
statistical tests were performed with the SPSS statistical
software package (version 12.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).
RESULTS
Tumor Characteristics

This prospective cohort study included 59 consecutive
patients who had BCLC stage B HCC without portal vein
invasion. The median tumor size was 4.8 cm (range, 2.014.6 cm); and, according to the American Joint Committee
on Cancer TNM classification, 42% of patients had stage II
HCC, and 58% of patients had stage III HCC (Table 1).
The median treatment duration was 18 months (range, 2-24
months). The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were
93% and 81%, respectively; and the 1-year and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 66% and 32%, respectively.
Overall Incidence of Drug-Related Adverse
Events

During the treatment period, the most frequent adverse
events were HFSR (93%), alopecia (69%), skin rash
(32%), diarrhea (15%), and hypertension (12%). There
were no grade 4 drug-related adverse events in any catego138

ries (Table 2). Fifty-five of 59 patients (93%) developed
sorafenib-induced HFSR, including grade 1 reactions in
15 patients, grade 2 reactions in 27, and grade 3 reactions
in 13. In addition, 47 of 59 patients (80%) had dose
reductions, and 3 patients (5%) discontinued sorafenib
because of drug-related adverse events. The median time
to HFSR occurrence from the start of sorafenib therapy
was 2 weeks (range, 1-12 weeks). There were no differences in age, sex, etiology, Child-Pugh class, tumor size, tumor number, or a-fetoprotein (AFP) level between
patients with and without high-grade (grade 2 or 3) HFSR
after sorafenib therapy (P > .05) (Table 3). However, the
frequency of high-grade HFSR was significantly greater in
patients who developed their first HFSR within 3 weeks of
sorafenib therapy (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.96-1.99; P ¼ .03).

because of their skewed distribution. There were no differences in serum VEGF or TNF-a levels between patients
with and without high-grade HFSR. However, high-grade

DISCUSSION
Like other antineoplastic agents, sorafenib is associated
with many side effects, including diarrhea, nausea, fatigue,
hypertension, and dermatologic toxicities. HFSR is
139

Original Article

currently emerging as a major toxicity of sorafenib treatment that requires clinical management and dose modifications, although the mechanism underlying HFSR is not
clearly understood. However, the reported incidence of
HFSR varies significantly among different clinical trials,
ranging between 9.1% and 61.9%.7,15-19 Recent Asian
and Western trials have indicated that Asian patients have
increased susceptibility to HFSR related to sorafenib
treatment.5 We also observed that the incidence of sorafenib-induced HFSR in our Korean patients with HCC was
higher than that reported in previous trials.5 The relatively
high incidence of HFSR in our study may have been a
result of the concomitant administration of doxorubicin
for TACE. However, in a randomized controlled trial of
TACE using doxorubicin and gelatin-sponges, there was
no report of HFSR among the treatment-related adverse
events.3 Therefore, the higher risk of HFSR occurrence in
the current study in relation to sorafenib therapy is much
more likely to be associated with genetic characteristics of
out patients than the combination of TACE or the use of
doxorubicin.
In our series, >85% of patients experienced HFSR
within 1 month of sorafenib administration. It is interesting to note that the incidence of high-grade HFSR was
significantly greater in patients who experienced their first
HFSR within 3 weeks of sorafenib therapy. These findings caution us to maintain a high index of suspicion for
the development of high-grade HFSR when the first reaction appears so early.
The pathogenesis of sorafenib-associated HFSR is
uncertain. Recently, several hypotheses regarding the
pathophysiology of HFSR have been suggested. These
include: 1) the accumulation of potentially toxic local
concentrations in eccrine sweat glands, which present in
greatest number or density in the palms and soles; 2) damaged vascular integrity because of the dual VEGFR-2 and
platelet-derived growth factor inhibition by sorafenib;
and 3) keratinocyte injury from sorafenib inhibition of tyrosine protein kinase kit (c-kit) or Raf kinase.7,20 The significant association of VEGF polymorphisms with highgrade HFSR in our study possibly supports the abovementioned hypotheses in relation to damaged vascular
integrity.
TNF-a and VEGF are important mediators of both
inflammation and angiogenesis.10 Angiogenesis plays an
important role in the inflammatory reaction. Inflammatory infiltrate leads to the development of fibrosis, yielding an increase of resistance to blood flow, which, in turn,
leads to tissue hypoxia.21 This condition can stimulate the
release of proangiogenetic factors responsible for vascular
140

remodeling and ischemic tissue injury. Damaged vascular
integrity and consequent tissue ischemia characterize
HFSR.8 In our study, several SNPs relevant to tumor
angiogenesis, especially TNF-a and VEGF, increased the
risk of sorafenib-induced high-grade HFSR, suggesting
that the altered expression of TNF-a and VEGF may
mediate the development and the severity of most dermatologic adverse events after sorafenib therapy.
TNF-a is a proinflammatory cytokine and an indirect mediator of angiogenesis.22,23 A genetic polymorphism of TNF-a at position 308 of the promoter
region, which includes the TNF-a 308G and TNF-a
308A alleles, has been associated with susceptibility to
various types of cancer.24 SNPs in promoter regions of
these gene can influence the expression levels of these
mediators.25 Carriers with the TNF-a 308G allele tend
to produce higher levels of the cytokine.26 These reports
coincide with the higher serum TNF-a level in patients
with the TNF-a 308GG genotype observed in our study
cohort 1 month after sorafenib therapy. In addition,
TNF-a 308GG was identified as an independent risk
factor for developing high-grade HFSR. Also, high-grade
HFSR developed more frequently in the high serum
TNF-a group compared with the low serum TNF-a
group 1 month after therapy, but not at baseline. These
findings suggest that TNF-a overexpression induced by
sorafenib administration may have mediated the genetic
predisposition to HFSR after sorafenib therapy in our
patients with HCC.
At high levels, TNF-a has antivascular and antiangiogenic activity; whereas, at lower concentrations, TNFa promotes angiogenesis.27 In addition, TNF-a reduces
blood flow in tumors in a dose-dependent fashion.28
These observations indicate that the TNF-a 308GG genotype may contribute to the development of HFSR by
increasing circulating TNF-a levels by means of the poor
vascular exchange. It is well known that TNF-a is an important mediator of septic shock.29 It is known that natural or recombinant TNF-a has considerable side effects,
including fatal vascular collapse and the induction of
widespread inflammatory responses.23 This ‘‘septic shocklike syndrome’’ by increased serum TNF-a may be responsible for the causation of HFSR associated with
impaired acral tissue circulation.
In the International HapMap cohorts, which
included large-scale genotyping in trios, TNF-a 308G
allele frequencies were much higher in Chinese populations (allele frequency, 0.967) and in Japanese populations (allele frequency, 0.977) than in Caucasian
populations (allele frequency, 0.783).30 VEGF 1991C
Cancer

HFSR After Sorafenib Therapy/Lee et al

allele frequencies both in Japanese populations (allele
frequency, 0.830) and in our Korean population (allele
frequency, 0.941) were a little bit higher than that in Caucasian populations (allele frequency, 0.828).30 Also,
UGT1A9 IVS1-37431A frequencies were notably higher
in Chinese populations (allele frequency, 0.795) and in
Japanese populations (allele frequency, 0.727) than in
Caucasian populations (allele frequency, 0.583). Therefore, a possible explanation for the high incidence rate of
HFSR among Japanese, Chinese, and Korean populations
may be associated with the aforementioned high prevalence of the frequencies of these gene in Asians.
The current study was performed with a relatively
small number of patients; thus, it had limited power to establish these genetic associations with clinical events.
However, we have demonstrated functional associations
between the genes relevant to angiogenesis and their
expression in relation to developing high-grade HFSR.
These findings may provide some mechanistic explanation for the development of HFSR in relation to the
VEGF pathway. In addition, the finding of an association
between the TNF-a pathway and the development of
HFSR is very interesting pathophysiologically and
deserves further study.
In conclusion, we report that several SNPs relevant
to tumor angiogenesis or drug metabolism, especially
VEGF 1991CC, TNF-a 308GG, and UGT1A9 IVS137431AA, increase the risk of sorafenib-induced, highgrade HFSR. These findings suggest that the differences
in the reported incidence of HFSR among different clinical trials may be related to ethnic differences in the allele
frequencies of the above-described SNPs. Also, the higher
serum TNF-a levels observed in our study 1 month after
therapy were correlated significantly with developing
high-grade HFSR. These data warrant further investigations on VEGF and TNF-a to identify the underlying
pathophysiologic mechanism of HFSR.
