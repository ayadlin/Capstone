ABSTRACT
Gemcitabine (GEM) resistance is a critical issue for pancreatic cancer
treatment.  The involvement of epigenetic modification in GEM resistance is still
unclear. We established a GEM-resistant subline PANC-1-R from the parental PANC1 pancreatic cancer cells and found the elevation of various chromatin-modifying
enzymes including G9a in GEM-resistant cells. Ectopic expression of G9a in PANC-1
cells increased GEM resistance while inactivation of G9a in PANC-1-R cells reduced
it. Challenge of PANC-1 cells with GEM increased the expression of stemness markers
including CD133, nestin and Lgr5 and promoted sphere forming activity suggesting
chemotherapy enriched cancer cells with stem-like properties. Inhibition of G9a in
PANC-1-R cells reduced stemness and invasiveness and sensitized the cells to GEM.
We revealed interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a downstream effector of G9a to increase GEM
resistance. G9a-overexpressing PANC-1-R cells exhibited autocrine IL-8/CXCR1/2
stimulation to increase GEM resistance which could be decreased by anti-IL-8 antibody
and G9a inhibitor. IL-8 released by cancer cells also activated pancreatic stellate
cell (PSC) to increase GEM resistance. In orthotopic animal model, GEM could not
suppress tumor growth of PANC-1-R cells and eventually promoted tumor metastasis.
Combination with G9a inhibitor and GEM reduced tumor growth, metastasis, IL-8
expression and PSC activation in animals. Finally, we showed that overexpression of
G9a correlated with poor survival and early recurrence in pancreatic cancer patients.
Collectively, our results suggest G9a is a therapeutic target to override GEM resistance
in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

(OS) rate less than 5% [1]. Only 20–30% of pancreatic
cancer patients could receive surgical resection at diagnosis,
and 70–80% of patients were identified as unresectable,
including locally advanced or metastatic disease [2].
Gemcitabine (GEM, 2ʹ,2ʹ-difluorodeoxycytidine) is
a nucleotide analogue widely used in cancer treatment [3].

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal
malignancies in the world. The features of late diagnosis,
highly metastatic ability and ineffective chemo- and radiotherapies lead to high mortality with a 5-year overall survival

At present, GEM is an important chemotherapeutic
drug for pancreatic cancer patients [4, 5]. However, the
response rate is low and the improvement of 5-year OS
is unsatisfied [6]. The reasons for a low response rate
could attribute to the intrinsic chemoresistance to GEM
or the acquired resistance developed after repeated
exposure. Several mechanisms have been suggested to
enhance GEM resistance. Nucleoside analogs like GEM
are imported into cancer cells via specialized transporter
systems including human equilibrative nucleosides
transporters (hENTs) and concentrative nucleosides
transporters and down-regulation of the transporters may
increase drug resistance [7, 8]. Low expression of hENT1
in pancreatic cancer patients displays poor OS and diseasefree survival (DFS) [9]. After entering cells, GEM needs to
be phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase for activation
[10]. Deficiency of deoxycytidine kinase is frequently
found in pancreatic cancer cells and therefore contributes
to inherent or induced GEM resistance in a portion of
patients [11]. The cytotoxicity of GEM is mediated by its
metabolite 2ʹ,2ʹ-difluoro dCDP (dFdCDP) and dFdCTP
to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase [12]. Up-regulation
of ribonucleotide reductase expression attenuates GEM
cytotoxicity and provides another mechanism of GEM
resistance [13].
Epigenetic regulations including DNA methylation
and histone modification have also been shown to involve
in GEM resistance. A global study of the DNA methylation
patterns in pancreatic cancer genome showed that 289
CpG sites were differentially methylated in normal
pancreas and pancreatic cancer [14]. Among the candidate
genes identified, 23 were hypermethylated and 35 were
hypomethylated in tumor parts. A metabolic enzyme
glutathione-S-transferase μ 1 (GSTM1) and a transcription
factor ONECUT2_E96_F were demonstrated to be useful
for the prediction of GEM sensitivity. Expression of
STAT1, an important transcription factor activated by
the interferon signaling pathway, was shown to play a
key role in the cellular response to GEM treatment [15].
Overexpression of 14-3-3σ has also been implicated in the
acquired GEM resistance in pancreatic and breast cancer
cells [16].
Study of three histone markers suggested that
cellular histone modification patterns may predict
prognosis and treatment response in resectable pancreatic
cancer [17]. Up-regulation of histone deacetylase 3
(HDAC3) promoted GEM resistance in pancreatic cancer
cells via modulation of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related
genes and two HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A and
4-phenylbutyrate inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic
cancer cells and enhanced the sensitivity to GEM [18–20].
By using PCR-based array approach, we showed that
several histone modifying enzymes are up-regulated in
GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrated
that G9a (also known as euchromatic histone-lysine
N-methyltransferase 2, EHMT2) plays an important role
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the development of GEM resistance via autocrine
and paracrine stimulation of cancer cells and pancreatic
stellate cells.

RESULTS
Up-regulation of histone modifying enzymes in
GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells
We had previously established a GEM-resistant
cell line (PANC-1-R) from the parental human PANC-1
pancreatic cancer cells [21]. To identify novel proteins
involving in GEM resistance, we investigated the changes
of histone modifying enzymes by using PCR array. As
shown in Table 1, we found that 21 histone modifying
enzymes including demethylases, methyltransferases,
acetyltransferases, kinases and ubiquitin ligases were
increased (> 2-fold) in GEM-resistant PANC-1-R cells.
We performed quantitative RT-PCR to confirm the results
of PCR array and found a similar increase of G9a, PRMT6
and SUV39H1 (Figure 1A). Among these molecules, we
first focused on the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a because
this enzyme has been shown to play an oncogenic role
in several cancers and is a potential target for drug
development [22].
We investigated whether overexpression of G9a
increased cell survival under GEM treatment. As shown
in Figure 1B, cells stably expressing G9a increased the
resistance to GEM. Conversely, knockdown of G9a
enhanced the sensitivity of PANC-1-R cells to GEM
(Figure 1C). These data suggested that G9a may be
involved in the regulation of GEM resistance.

G9a was upregulated by GEM challenge and
enhanced cancer stemness
Cancer cells with stemness properties have been
shown to display high resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents. PANC-1 cells were continuously incubated
with different concentrations of GEM for 10 days and
the surviving cells were harvested for the analysis of
G9a and stemness genes. As shown in Figure 1D, G9a
was significantly up-regulated in the surviving cells.
In addition, the expression of three stemness markers
of pancreatic cancer including CD133, nestin and Lgr5
was also up-regulated suggesting GEM treatment may
stimulate the stem-like properties of cancer cells and
enrich a population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) with
high drug resistance. On the contrary, depletion of G9a
reduced the expression of CD133 in PANC-1-R cells
(Figure 1E). Moreover, the sphere number and size formed
by PANC-1-R cells was about 2.5-fold higher than that
of PANC-1 cells and knockdown of G9a in PANC-1-R
cells significantly reduced the sphere forming activity
(Figure  1F). Clonogenic assay also showed that G9a
depletion sensitized PANC-1-R cells to GEM (Figure 1G).

We also validated the role of G9a in cancer
stemness by studying another GEM-resistant human
pancreatic cancer cell line (Mia-paca-2-R) derived from
the parental Mia-paca-2 cells. Compared to the parental
cells, the expression of G9a was upregulated by 3.5-fold
in Mia-paca-2-R cells (Supplementary Figure S1A).
A G9a specific inhibitor UNC0638 also decreased the
proliferation of Mia-paca-2-R cells in a dose-dependent
manner and sensitized the cells to GEM treatment
(Supplementary Figure S1B). In addition, UNC0638
reduced the sphere forming activity of Mia-paca-2-R cells
and co-treatment of UNC0638 and GEM suppressed the
sphere number by 75–80% when compared to the control
group (Supplementary Figure S1C).

IL-8 was found in Mia-paca-2-R cells (Supplementary
Figure S2A). Knockdown of G9a significantly reduced
IL-8 mRNA level in PANC-1-R cells and the secreted
IL-8 in the conditioned medium (Figure 2C). Conversely,
ectopic expression of G9a in PANC-1 cells upregulated
IL-8 expression and increased secreted IL-8 in the culture
medium (Figure 2D). Interestingly, we found that both
pancreatic cancer cells and PSCs expressed IL-8 receptors
CXCR1 and CXCR2 implicating the possibility that
G9a-increased IL-8 could affect cancer cells and PSCs
simultaneously (Figure 3A). Ectopic expression of G9a in
PANC-1 or knockdown of G9a in PANC-1-R cells did not
change the CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression (Figure 3B).
Addition of IL-8 recombinant protein stimulated the
proliferation of PANC-1 cells (Figure 3C). Overexpression
of G9a increased the growth of PANC-1 cells which
could be attenuated by anti-IL-8 antibody indicating IL-8
is a downstream effector for G9a to promote cellular
proliferation (Figure 3C). In addition, increase of GEM
resistance in PANC-1 cells by overexpression of G9a was
reduced by IL-8 antibody (Figure 3D). Co-treatment of
CXCR1 and CXCR2 antibodies also decreased the G9ainduced GEM resistance to a similar magnitude. Similarly,
neutralization of IL-8 produced by PANC-1-R cells also
increased the cytotoxic effect of GEM (Figure 3E). These
data suggested that IL-8 increased by G9a overexpression

IL-8 is a mediator of G9a-induced GEM
resistance
To identify the molecules that mediated G9a-induced
chemoresistance, we first focused on soluble factors
including growth factors and cytokines. Our array-based
approach demonstrated that three cytokines including
IL-8 were upregulated in PANC-1-G9a cells (Figure 2A).
We checked the levels of IL-8 in PANC-1 and PANC1-R cells and found an 8-fold increase of IL-8 mRNA
in PANC-1-R cells (Figure 2B). A three-fold increase of

could enhance GEM resistance in cancer cells via
autocrine IL-8/CXCR1/2 stimulation. However, it should
be noted that IL-8 or CXCR1/2 antibodies only partially
reversed the resistance suggesting the involvement of
other molecules in G9a-induced GEM resistance.
To further confirm the effect of IL-8 on GEM
resistance, we pre-treated PANC-1 cells with IL-8 for
24 h and then incubated with different does of GEM for
another 48 h. As shown in Figure 3F, pretreatment of IL-8
partly protected GEM-induced cell death. We also found
that IL-8 recombinant protein could rescue the reduction
of sphere formation by G9a knockdown suggesting IL-8
acts downstream of G9a (Figure 3G). Both IL-8 antibody
and CXCR1/CXCR2 antibody combination significantly
reduced the sphere number and size of G9a-overexpressing
cells indicating that IL-8 is a mediator for G9a to promote
cancer stemness via an IL-8/CXCR1/2 signaling axis
(Supplementary Figure S3). Similarly, UNC0638 and IL-8
antibody also significantly decreased the sphere forming
activity of Mia-paca-2-R cells (Supplementary Figure S2B).

Interesting, our data also showed that PANC-1-R
cells exhibited higher trans-endothelial migration ability
than PANC-1 cells (panel 1 and 3, Figure 3H). Addition
of IL-8 neutralizing antibody significantly reduced the
invasion of PANC-1-R cells (panel 3 and 4, Figure 3H).
Notably, the depletion of G9a also dramatically suppressed
the trans-endothelial migration ability (panel 3 and 5,
Figure 3H). These data suggested IL-8 is involved in G9ainduced proliferation, trans-endothelial invasion, and
GEM resistance of pancreatic cancer cells.

IL-8 induces PSC activation and extracellular
matrix deposition
Pancreatic cancer presents a dense desmoplastic
stroma consisting abundant extracellular matrix proteins
released by activated PSC to reduce the penetration of
chemotherapeutic agents which leads to increased drug
resistance. Because we found PSC expressed high level
of CXCR1 and CXCR2 (Figure 3A), the effect of IL-8 on

PSC activation was investigated. As shown in Figure 4A,
IL-8 did not stimulate PSC proliferation. However, IL-8
induced PSC activation in a dose-dependent manner as
evidenced by the up-regulation of alpha-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA) and fibronectin (Figure 4B). The deposition
of fibronectin surrounding the PSCs was also increased
by IL-8 (Figure 4C). Co-culture of IL-8-overexpressing
PANC-1-R cells with PSC induced abundant fibronectin
deposition while co-culture with G9a-depleted PANC1-R cells showed little effect (Figure 4D). Neutralization
of IL-8 in the conditioned medium of PANC-1-R cells
decreased fibronectin deposition (Figure 4D) and also
reduced the stimulation of fibronectin expression by the
conditioned medium in PSC cells (Figure 4E).
UNC0638 also significantly inhibited fibronectin
deposition and PSC activation induced by co-culture
(Figure 4F and 4G). Finally, we studied lipid droplet
decomposition to confirm the activation of PSC by IL-8
and found that IL-8 reduced the number of lipid droplet
stained by Oil Red which could be fully reversed by
UNC0638 (Figure 4H). Collectively, these data suggested
that IL-8 released by pancreatic cancer cells stimulates
PSC activation via paracrine mechanism and inhibition of
G9a in cancer cells reduces IL-8 secretion, PSC activation,
and matrix protein deposition.

We checked regional metastasis of tumors in the
animals and found that tumors of the control group were
mainly located within the pancreas with some local
invasions as the IVIS image showed weak signals in the
regional lymph nodes (group a, Figure 5C). GEM treatment
alone did not exhibit any suppressive effect and eventually
promoted local invasion and metastasis to liver (group b,
Figure 5C). Tumors of the UNC0638 group were restricted
in the pancreas of the animals (group c, Figure 5C). Tumor
size was dramatically reduced in the GEM+UNC0638
group and no local invasion was found in the animals
(group d, Figure 5C). Consistent to these results, ectopic
expression of dominant-negative G9a (without enzymatic
activity) in PANC-1-R cells also reduced their tumorforming activity in animals (Figure  5D). Compared the
photon counts of the animals at 2 and 4 weeks after cancer
cell injection, a 2-fold increase was found in the control
group while only a 15% increase was detected in the
dominant-negative G9a group (Figure 5E).
Immunohistochemical analyses revealed the positive
staining of G9a and IL-8 in the control and GEM-treated
groups and the level of these two proteins was reduced in
the UNC0638 and GEM+UNC0638 groups (Figure 5F).
It should be noted that the levels of G9a and IL-8 were
always much higher in the GEM-treated group compared
to the control group. These data implied that continuous
presence of GEM is required for the maintenance of drugresistant phenotype and the resistance may be decreased
after the removal of GEM for a period. Similar results
were also found in the cultured cells. We found the
expression of α-SMA in the stellate cells of the control
and GEM-treated tumors suggesting the activation of
PSC. Conversely, very low or negative α-SMA signal was
observed in the UNC0638 and GEM+UNC0638 groups.
To validate the inhibitory effect of UNC0638 on G9a
activity, we examined the H3K9 di-methylation status. As
shown in Figure 5F, the control and GEM-treated groups
showed strong H3K9 di-methylation staining while the
UNC0638 and the GEM+UNC0638 groups demonstrated
weak staining. The signal intensity of G9a in the tumors
matched the signal intensity of H3K9 dimethylation
confirming the inhibition of G9a activity by UNC0638.
These data suggested that combination of GEM and G9a
inhibitor could suppress tumor growth and metastasis of
GEM-resistant cancer cells.

Inhibition of G9a overcomes GEM resistance in
orthotopic animal study
To validate G9a is a therapeutic target to override
GEM resistance as demonstrated in our cell-based assays,
we performed orthotopic animal study to determine
whether G9a inhibitor could cooperate with GEM to
inhibit growth and metastasis of drug-resistance cells.
PANC-1-R cells were injected into the pancreas of mice.
One week later, mice were randomly distributed into four
groups to receive DMSO (control), GEM, UNC0638
and GEM+UNC0638 treatment. As shown in Figure 5A,
GEM treatment did not significantly inhibit PANC-1-R
tumors. UNC0638 alone showed partial inhibition and
GEM+UNC0638 demonstrated a significant suppression
of tumor growth. At 6 weeks, tumors of the control group
grew continuously (Figure 5A). Unexpectedly, GEM
treatment boosted the growth of PANC-1-R tumors.
UNC0638 induced shrinkage of tumors in 75% (3/4) of
the animals and combination of GEM and UNC0638
potently inhibited tumor growth. We also quantified the
photon number fluxed from the tumors and the data of
the animals measured at week 3 and 6 were compared.
As shown in Figure 5B, a 3.5-fold increase of photon
counts was detected in the control growth consisting with
the upregulation of image intensity in Figure 5A. GEM
treatment induced a higher (about 5-fold) increase of
photon counts in animals. UNC0638 alone suppressed
the increase to 1.7-fold and UNC0638+GEM reduced the
increase to only 20%.

outcome in pancreatic cancer

examined the correlation between G9a expression and
clinical characteristics. Sixty pancreatic cancer patients
were included and their clinical information was shown

expression was not associated with sex, age, tumor size,
pathological grade, lymph node metastasis, and tumor
stage (Table 3). The lack of correlation between G9a and
tumor size or lymph node metastasis could be due to the
small case number investigated in this study. However,

myeloid leukemia cells and acted synergistically with
other epigenetic drugs to kill leukemia cells [26]. Another
example is DOT1L, a H3K79 methyltransferase and a core
component of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein
complex, which involved in the transforming activity
of various MLL-rearranged fusion oncogenes [27]. The
development of DOT1L inhibitors is a hot area in anticancer drug research. Currently, clinical trial has been
initiated with a potent DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676 for the
treatment of hematological malignancies [28]. We picked
up G9a as a candidate of high priority because this enzyme
is known to function as an oncogene in several cancers
and potent inhibitors against this methyltransferase have
been developed [29]. The role of other histone modifying
enzymes in the tumorigenesis and drug resistance of
pancreatic cancer is under investigation in our laboratory.
Previous studies have shown that G9a perpetuates
malignant phenotypes through multiple mechanisms. G9a
depletion restored a cohort of tumor suppressor genes
including E-cadherin, DUSP5, SPRY4, and PPP1R15A
in ovarian cancer [30]. G9a also inhibited the expression
of cell adhesion molecule EP-CAM in lung cancer to
increase aggressiveness [31]. In addition, G9a regulated
the expression of FAS to modulate the resistance of

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we profiled the expression
of histone modifying enzymes by using array-based
approach to elucidate the alterations of these enzymes
in GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to link histone
modifying enzymes with GEM-resistance in a global
way. Among the altered enzymes, several potential
therapeutic targets warrant further investigation. For
example, SUV39H1 is a methyltransferase responsive for
the introduction of trimethylation of lysine-9 of histone
H3 (H3K9) [23]. Recently, a specific SUV39H1 inhibitor
chaetocin has been reported [24, 25]. Our previous study
found that chaetocin induced differentiation of acute

metastatic colon cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil in vitro
and in vivo [32]. The regulation of cancer stemness by
G9a was first reported in basal-like breast cancer cells
[33]. The study showed that a repression complex SnailG9a- DNA methyltransferase 1 may repress fructose-1,6biphosphatase expression to change cellular metabolism
and to increase cancer stem cell characters. Two recent
studies demonstrated that G9a plays an important role
in the maintenance of cancer stem cell-like properties
in head and neck cancer and in obesity-mediated breast
cancer progression [34, 35]. Conversely, G9a was shown
to inhibit the expression of CD133 and SOX2 to reduce
the self-renewal of glioma cancer stem cells [36]. We
provide evidence that G9a expression correlated with the
expression of the stemness genes including CD133, nestin
and Lrg5 and inhibition of G9a in pancreatic cancer cells
attenuated CD133 expression suggesting a role of G9a in
the regulation of stemness in this cancer.
Although G9a shows oncogenic activity in cancers,
its role in drug resistance is largely unknown. Candilaria
et al demonstrated that hydralazine, a smooth muscle
relaxant and vasodilator, could reverse GEM resistance in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cervical cancer cells [37]. They found hydralazine could
inhibit G9a activity in vitro and in cells and suggested
that G9a may be a target for hydralazine to counteract
GEM resistance. However, hydralazine is not a specific
G9a inhibitor and could target a number of intracellular
molecules to elicit its biological effect. Therefore, the
contribution of G9a in GEM resistance is still unclear.
By using a specific inhibitor (UNC0638) and different
approaches (shRNA knockdown, overexpression and
animal study), we demonstrated for the first time that G9a
is an important determinant of GEM resistance.
GEM resistance in vivo may generate from (1)
genetic alterations in cancer cells to modulate drug
transports and DNA repair enzymes, (2) change of
stromal components to interfere drug penetration, and
(3) crosstalk between cancer and stromal cells to against
drug cytotoxicity via exchange of survival factors or
direct cell-cell contact. We focused on the cancer/stroma
crosstalk and identified IL-8 as a downstream effector
of G9a to increase GEM resistance by both autocrine
and paracrine stimulation. The IL-8/CXCR1/CXCR2
signaling axis is critical for the establishment of stem-like

properties in breast cancer [38]. How IL-8 is upregulated
in cancer cells is under intensive investigation. Hypoxia
and acidosis have been shown to increase IL-8 expression
and contribute to aggressive behaviors of pancreatic cancer
cells [39, 40]. We provided evidence that overexpression
of G9a induced IL-8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
through transcriptional activation. We further showed that
G9a inhibition decreased IL-8 expression and enhanced the
sensitivity of drug-resistant cancer cells to GEM. Moreover,
depletion of secreted IL-8 by neutralizing antibody also
reduced the resistance to GEM suggesting cancer cells may
enhance GEM resistance via an autocrine IL-8/CXCR1/2
loop. Importantly, we also found that IL-8 released by
cancer cells induced activation of PSC via a paracrine
mechanism to produce abundant extracellular matrix
proteins that may interfere drug penetration into tumors.
We hypothesize that GEM treatment stimulates G9a
expression in pancreatic cancer cells that in turn enriches
a population of G9a-overexpressing stem-like cancer cells
to produce IL-8 to modulate tumor microenvironment to
increase GEM resistance. This hypothesis is evidenced
by the animal study that G9a inhibitor in combination
with GEM reduces IL-8 production and decreases tumor
growth, lymph node invasion and distant metastasis of
GEM-resistant cancer cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

It is obvious that IL-8 is not the only effector
controlled by G9a to promote GEM resistance. In our
cytokine arrays, several potential molecules like CXCL5
and GRO (also known as CXCL1) may also involve in
G9a-induced GEM resistance. In addition to soluble
factors, the importance of cellular proteins that promote
cell-cell contact could not be underscored. Further studies
will be needed to clarify the role of these molecules
in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our results provide a
molecular basis by which G9a promotes the resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs by changing cancer cells
and stromal cells simultaneously. More importantly, we
identify G9a inhibitors as potential compounds to override
GEM resistance in pancreatic cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, reagents and plasmids
Pancreatic cancer cell lines were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum. A gemcitabine-resistant cell line (PANC1-R) was established from the parental human PANC-1
pancreatic cancer cells [21]. Pancreatic satellite cells
(PSC) were kindly provided from Kelvin K. Tsai (National

Health Research Institutes, Taiwan). RNA interference
expression plasmid specific for G9a was purchased by the
National RNAi Core Facility (Academia Sinica, Taiwan).
The sources of antibodies used were: anti-G9a and antiIL-8 were from Epitommics Burlingame, CA, USA); Antiα-SMA antibody was from Sigma. (St. Louis, MI, USA).
UNC0638 was purchased from Cayman Company (An
Arbor, MI, USA). GEM (Gemzar, Lilly) stocks (40 mg/ml)
were stored in aliquots at 4°C until use. G9a shRNA
plasmids were from National RNAi Core, Taiwan (G9a#1
sequence: GCTCCAGGAATTTAACAAGAT; G9a#2
sequence: CTCCAGGAATTTAACAAGATT).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
for IL-8
PANC-1 cells stably expressing G9a expression
vector or G9a shRNA plasmids were cultured in
DMEM medium for 24 h. The conditioned medium
was collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min to
remove cell debris. IL-8 concentration was measured
using Quantikines Human IL-8 Immunoassay kit (R&D,
Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Lentivirus production and delivery shRNA
For lentivirus particle production, 293FT cells were
plated in 10-cm dishes (1 × 106 cells per dish) transfected
by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The following plasmids were
used for transfection per 10-cm dish: 6 μg PLKO.1
puro-shG9a, 0.6 μg of the envelop plasmid pMD.G2
and 5.4  μg of the packaging vector pCMV delta8.9.
The media were changed the next day, and virus were
harvested by collecting the media at 48 and 72 h posttransfection, and then passed through 0.45-μm filter and
stored at −80°C. For lentivirus transduction, PANC-1 cells
were infected by media containing virus and polybrene
(8 μg/ml). After 24  h, media were replaced with fresh
medium containing 2.5 μg/ml of puromycin to select the
successfully infected cells.

Cell migration and invasion assay
Cell migration and invasion ability were performed
as previously described [41]. Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were
seeded in 24-well transwell units with polycarbonate
filters (pore size 8 μm) coated on the upper side with 1%
gelatin (Sigma) for invasion assay for 24 h. After careful
removal of the cells in the upper surface of the filters,
migrated and invaded cells were fixed and stained with
0.05% Trypan Blue.

Trans-endothelial migration assay
The in vitro trans-endothelial migration assay was
followed using CytoSelect™ Tumor Transendothelial
Migration Assay (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA).
SVEC4-10 endothelial cells (5 × 104 cells) were placed
on top of a Matrigel-coated transwell (8 μm pore size) and
allowed to adhere for 24 h. After that, PANC-1 or PANC1-R cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were stained with CytoTracker
and placed on top of upper chamber for another 24 h. Cocultures were fixed with paraformaldehyde and analyzed
by fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems,
Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada). In antibody inhibition
studies, cancer cells were co-incubated with the control
immunoglobulin (Ig) or anti-IL-8 blocking antibody
(Genetex) before seeding.

PCR arrays and real-time RT-qPCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Two hundred nanograms of
total RNA from each sample were reverse-transcribed
into cDNA using the RT2 first strand kit (Qiagen). The
Human Epigenetic Chromatin Modification Enzymes RT²
Profiler™ PCR Array (Qiagen) was used to examine the
mRNA levels of 84 key genes. Both β-actin and GAPDH
were used as house-keeping genes. Several negative
controls were included in each run. All PCR experiments
were conducted with a StepOne Real Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The data analysis was
performed using the ΔΔCt based calculations. For real-time
RT-qPCR analysis, total RNA was extracted and assays
were done in triplicated by using the primers indicated as

Cytokine antibody array
Proteins secreted from PANC-1 or G9aoverexpressing PANC-1 cells were compared by using
the RayBio Human Chemokine Array C1 (RayBiotech
Inc) according to the manufacture’s instructions. In brief,
cells were seeded into 10-cm dish. After 24 h, culture
medium was changed to fresh medium with 1% FBS for
another 24 h. The conditioned medium was then collected,
concentrated and subjected to the antibody array incubation.
Finally, the protein spots were detected using ECL Western
blotting detection and quantified by a densitometer.

15 min. Sections were stained with indicated primary
antibodies, appropriate secondary antibodies and
Envission system (Dako, Denmark). Finally, sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin and analyzed by
microscope.

Cells were maintained as a monolayer in high
glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
100  IU/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin
at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were
collected and washed to remove serum, then suspended
in serum-free DMEM/F12 supplemented with 100 IU/ml
penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 20 ng/ml human
recombinant epidermal growth factor (hrEGF), 10 ng/ml
human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor
(hrbFGF), 2% B27 supplement without vitamin A, 1%
N2 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells
were subsequently cultured in ultra low attachment 6-well
plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) at a density
(5,000 cells/well). After 14 days, number and size of the
spheres were analyzed by ImageJ software.

Statistics
The experiments were repeated at three times.
Results are expressed as Mean + SE as indicated. Twotailed Student’s t test was performed to compare intergroup
differences. The overall survival was analyzed by the
Kaplan-Meier estimator and analyzed by the log-rank
test. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
