ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. A new promising anticancer therapy involves the use of monoclonal antibodies specific for target tumor-associated
antigens (TAAs). A TAA of interest for immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer
(TNBC) is nucleolin (NCL), a multifunctional protein, selectively expressed on the surface of
cancer cells, which regulates the biogenesis of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in tumor
development and drug-resistance. We previously isolated a novel human anti-NCL scFv, called
4LB5, that is endowed with selective anti-tumor effects. Here we report the construction and
characterization of a novel immunoRNase constituted by 4LB5 and a human pancreatic RNase
(HP-RNase) called “4LB5-HP-RNase”. This immunoRNase retains both the enzymatic activity
of human pancreatic RNase and the specific binding of the parental scFv to a panel of surface
NCL-positive breast cancer cells. Notably, 4LB5-HP-RNase dramatically and selectively
reduced the viability and proliferation of NCL-positive tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.
Specifically, it induced apoptosis and reduced the levels of the tumorigenic miRNAs miR-21,
-221 and -222. Thus, this novel immunoagent could be a valuable tool for the treatment of
TNBC patients ineligible for currently available targeted treatments.

INTRODUCTION

TNBC diagnoses per year [7]. These patients develop a
malignant phenotype, and their death rate is higher than
any other type of BC (median overall survival around
12 months in the metastatic setting) [8].
A new attractive target for TNBC immunotherapy
is nucleolin (NCL), a major nucleolar protein [9] that
is directly involved in ribosomal processing [10, 11].
Nucleolin is a multi-functional protein that is involved
in the metabolism of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
rRNA maturation, and ribosome biogenesis. Nucleolin is
mainly localized in the nucleus, but is also overexpressed
in the cytoplasm and on the surface of leukemic, renal,
pulmonary, prostate, intestinal, breast, hepatic, kidney,
cervical, colon cancer cells, melanomas and gliomas [10,
12–14]. Altered NCL surface expression and localization
is directly or indirectly involved in signal transduction
events subsequent to its interaction with several
molecules/receptors on the cell surface that are involved

Breast cancer (BC) will affect one in eight (12%)
women during their lives and almost half a million patients
lose their life to BC annually, thus being the most frequent
cancer among women [1]. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a
humanized antibody, is in clinical use for ErbB2-positive
breast carcinoma [2, 3]. However, ErbB2 overexpression/
amplification occurs in only ~25% of BC patients [4]
many of whom are de novo resistant or will acquire
resistance to this treatment [5]. Furthermore, concerns
have been raised about the cardiotoxicity of Trastuzumab
and other anti-ErbB2 drugs [6]. Consequently, there is
a need for new specific targets for the therapy of antiErbB2-resistant breast cancer, including Triple Negative
Breast Cancer (TNBC), which lacks estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor and ErbB2. TNBC accounts
for ~14% of all breast cancers and about 170,000 new

in cell growth, tumor invasiveness, inflammation and/or
angiogenesis. Thus, surface NCL is an attractive target
for customized breast cancer therapy also because it is
continuously overexpressed on the tumor cell surface and
is associated with malignant proliferation irrespective of
nuclear NCL [15].
Consistent with its involvement in RNA processing,
we previously reported that NCL promotes the maturation
of a specific set of microRNAs (miRNAs), namely,
miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222, whose up-regulation is
involved in breast tumorigenesis, metastasis formation,
and drug resistance [16–19]. Accordingly, NCL inhibition
resulted in a decrease in the oncogenic potential of
TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. This finding confirms the
importance of tumorigenic miRNAs in immune escape,
neovascularization and metastasis, as well as the key role
played by NCL in affecting their levels [11].
Aptamers (AS1411) [20] and peptides [21–22],
specific for NCL, are available that bind and inhibit this
protein in cancer cells. These compounds have been
proposed as vehicles for the specific delivery of antitumor
moieties into cancer cells [23]. Although promising,
NCL-targeting aptamers and peptides could have an
extremely short in vivo half-life due to their small
molecular size and thus fail in in vivo therapies.
To circumvent these problems, we previously
isolated a novel fully human anti-NCL scFv, called
“4LB5”, by phage-display technology [24]. This
immunoagent recognizes the RNA binding domain of
NCL, selectively binds with high affinity to it on the cell
membrane, and discriminates between breast tumor and
normal cells. 4LB5 is also internalized in the cytoplasm
of target cells, reduces their cell viability and growth
both in cell cultures and in animal models, and abrogates
the biogenesis of NCL-dependent miRNAs [24]. In the
attempt to enhance the potential therapeutic effect of
4LB5, we have engineered a novel anti-NCL fully human
immunoRNase (IR), called “4LB5-HP-RNase”, by fusing
4LB5 with the human pancreatic ribonuclease in a similar
manner to the previously described anti-ErbB2 IR [25].
Here we describe the production and
characterization of this novel IR and report its antitumor
effects both in vitro and in vivo.

the RNase, which is at the C-terminal end, followed by a
hexahistidine tag for the detection and purification of the
chimeric construct (Figure 1A). The recombinant 4LB5HP-RNase was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified
by affinity chromatography on a resin with immobilized
cobalt ions, as described under Materials and Methods,
and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Figure 1B, a
single product with a correct molecular weight of about
46 kDa was detected, thus indicating that the recombinant
protein was homogeneous. Western blotting analyses
with an anti-Histidine antibody revealed a product with
the expected molecular weight, that corresponded to
the fusion protein (Figure 1C). The fusion protein was
then tested for its enzymatic activity by a zymogram,
developed by using yeast RNA as a substrate, as described
in “Materials and Methods”. As illustrated in Figure 1D,
a single active band was detected that corresponded to
the molecular weight of 4LB5-HP-RNase, thus indicating
that the immunoRNase is endowed with RNase activity
of native human pancreatic ribonuclease comparable
to that of another immunoRNase, ERB-HP-RNase,
previously described [25], used as positive control.

4LB5-HP-RNase binds to NCL on the membrane
of tumor cells
Although NCL is predominantly localized in the
nucleolus, NCL is overexpressed in the cytoplasm and
on the membrane of many different tumor cell types
[10]. Accordingly, we demonstrated that anti-NCL scFv
4LB5 specifically binds to NCL on the surface of actively
proliferating breast cancer cells [24]. To evaluate the
ability of the chimeric protein 4LB5-HP-RNase to bind to
NCL-positive cells, we carried out an ELISA assay on a
panel of breast tumor cells, such as MDA-MB-231, MDAMB-436, BT-549 (all Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
cells) and MCF7 cells (luminal epithelial breast cancer),
expressing high levels of surface-NCL. In parallel assays,
we used normal-like MCF10a breast cells that express low
levels of surface-NCL as a negative control. As shown in
Figure 2A, 4LB5-HP-RNase specifically binds to all NCLpositive cancer cell lines with an affinity similar to that of
the parental 4LB5 scFv, tested in a parallel assay, but not
to MCF-10a normal-like mammary cells.
To evaluate the binding affinity of 4LB5-HPRNase to NCL expressed on live cells, we constructed
binding curves on each cell line treated with increasing
concentrations (5–500 nM) of the purified immunoRNase,
as described in “Materials and Methods”. As shown
in Figure 2B, 4LB5-HP-RNase efficiently binds to the
surface of these cells with an apparent affinity in the
nanomolar range (5–50 nM). To determine whether
the detected binding was due to the specific interaction
between 4LB5 and NCL, we analyzed the binding of
4LB5-HP-RNase to MDA-MB-231 cells by ELISA assay
before and after its pre-incubation with equimolar doses of

in vitro labeled with Cy5 fluorescent dye and added to
culture medium of MDA-MB-231 cells for 4 h at 37°C.
As control, cells were also incubated with 4LB5-Cy5
and with Cy5 alone, for background evaluation. A series
of images through the full volume of the cells (z-stacks)
was analyzed by using confocal microscopy. As expected,
no Cy5 fluorescent signal was observed when cells were
treated with unconjugated fluorescent dye (Figure 3A).
Intracellular localization was observed for both 4LB5-Cy5
(Figure 3B) and 4LB5-HP-RNase-Cy5 (Figure 3C). While
much of the signal was intracellular, some extracellular
4LB5-HP-RNase and 4LB5 was also observed. We
performed analysis of the Mean Fluorescent Intensity
(MFI) of intracellular and extracellular Cy5 signal for
Figure 3B and 3C and determined that the ratio between
intracellular and extracellular signal was 3.86 and 1.72
for 4LB5-HP-RNase and 4LB5, respectively. These
data demonstrate that the majority of 4LB5-HP-RNase
is being internalized. A three dimensional rendering of
the data shown in Figure 3C presented in Figure 3D and
a Supplementary Video S1 further demonstrate that the
4LB5-HP-RNase-Cy5 is taken up by the cells. Collectively,
these data are consistent with previous results showing that
4LB5 is internalized [24] by NCL-positive tumor cells.

NCL-RNA Binding Domain (RBD) recombinant protein
used as a bait for the initial identification of 4LB5 scFv
[24]. As shown in Figure 2C, 4LB5-HP-RNase binding to
cells was significantly lower (over 50%) in the presence of
NCL-RBD than in its absence.
Finally, we performed a pull-down assay to verify the
interaction between endogenous NCL and 4LB5-HP-RNase.
To this end, we incubated total cell extracts of MDAMB-231 cells with either 4LB5-HP-RNase or 4LB5 and
loaded them on a high-capacity Ni-NTA resin to isolate
the protein complexes by His-tag binding of the chimeric
construct (see Materials and Methods). Bound NCL trapped
in immunocomplexes with 4LB5-HP-RNase or 4LB5 was
detected by immunoblotting using a commercially available
anti-NCL mAb as primary antibody. As shown in Figure 2D,
immunoblotting with an anti-His antibody confirmed
similar pull-down of the 4LB5-HP-RNase (46 kDa)
and 4LB5 (27 kDa) proteins. Immunoreactive bands of the
expected molecular size corresponding to NCL (100 kDa)
were observed in total cell extracts after NCL pull-down
with either 4LB5-HP-RNase or 4LB5 with comparable
intensity, thus confirming that 4LB5-HP-RNase
specifically binds to NCL in a manner similar to that of
the parental 4LB5 scFv. In the sample of cell extracts
treated with 4LB5-HP-RNase is visible an additional band
of lower molecular weight that could be a product derived
from degradation of the immunoRNase likely in the spacer
between the scFv and RNase.

4LB5-HP-RNase inhibits tumor cell growth in vitro
NCL inhibition induced with anti-NCL aptamer
AS1411 [11] or scFv 4LB5 [24] impairs breast
cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we
hypothesized that the fusion compound could exert
enhanced cytotoxic effects, thereby combining the antineoplastic properties of both 4LB5 and HP-RNase,
following intra-cytoplasmic delivery. To address this
hypothesis, we first evaluated the ability of 4LB5– HP- RNase

4LB5-HP-RNase is taken up by breast tumor cells
We previously reported that, after interaction with
NCL, 4LB5 is actively internalized into breast cancer
cells [24]. To determine if also its derived immunoRNase
is internalized by TNBC cells, 4LB5-HP-RNase was

to exert a specific cytotoxic effect on NCL-positive cells
by incubating MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, BT-549
or MCF7 breast cancer cells with and without increasing
concentrations of the protein (10–200 nM). After treatment
for 72 h at 37°C, cell survival was analyzed by either trypan
blue-exclusion cell counting by using an Automated Cell
Counter TC10 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) or by MTT
assays. As shown in Figure 4A, 4LB5–HP-RNase selectively
and dose-dependently inhibited the viability of the NCLpositive MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, BT-549 and MCF7
cells, with an IC50 of about 25 nM, 50 nM, 12,5 nM and
25 nM, respectively. These results were confirmed also by
MTT assays. 4LB5–HP-RNase exerted only slight effects
on NCL-negative MCF-10a (normal-like) breast control cells
and only at high concentrations.
To verify the antitumor effects of the new construct
and to compare them to those of 4LB5, we tested the
effects of 4LB5-HP-RNase on the proliferation of
surface-NCL-positive MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436
and BT-549 breast cancer cells in colony formation
assays.

The results indicate that the number of colonies in
the sample treated with 4LB5-HP-RNase is much lower
than that of negative control cells and significantly reduced
with respect to cells treated with the parental 4LB5 scFv
tested in parallel assays (Figure 4B–4D), which indicates
that, probably due to its acquired RNase activity, 4LB5HP-RNase inhibits the proliferation of all treated cells
more efficiently than do the parental scFv.

4LB5-HP-RNase induces apoptosis in surface
NCL-positive cancer cells
Several recent reports indicate that NCL negatively
regulates cell apoptosis [11]. The role of cell surface NCL
is highlighted by studies showing that functional blockage
or down-regulation of cell surface NCL expression results
in migration inhibition and tube formation [26, 27], and
causes endothelial-cell apoptosis [28]. To investigate
whether the reduction of the viability and proliferation
of surface-NCL cells treated with 4LB5-HP-RNase
is associated with its ability to induce apoptosis, the

MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells were incubated with
increasing amounts of 4LB5-HP-RNase (1–200 nM). After
72 hours of exposure to 4LB5-HP-RNase, we measured
the levels of not cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
1 (PARP-1), which is degraded during apoptosis [29], in
total cell extracts. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, 4LB5HP-RNase dose-dependently degraded PARP; in fact, no
PARP signal was observed after treatment with 50 nM
protein, which confirms that anti-NCL immunoRNase
activates the apoptotic pathway.

shown in Figure 6A, Real-Time PCR analysis revealed
that 4LB5-HP-RNase dose-dependently reduced the
levels of the mature miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222
with a relevant effect already at the lowest concentration
tested. A previous study demonstrated that 4LB5 alone
inhibited the interaction between NCL and the micro-RNA
microprocessor complex thereby impairing the maturation
of these NCL-dependent miRNAs [24].
To evaluate if the effects exerted by 4LB5-HPRNase on mature miRNAs levels were due also to RNA
degradation of the ribonuclease moiety and not only to
inhibition, mediated by the scFv domain, of the interaction
of NCL with the microprocessor complex, MDA-MB-231
cells were incubated in parallel assays with equimolar
doses of 4LB5 or 4LB5-HP-RNase. As shown in Figure 6B,
the immunoRNase downregulates miRNAs levels more
efficiently than does 4LB5, which suggests that the
enzymatic activity of the ribonuclease greatly enhances
the effect of 4LB5 on miRNAs levels. These results
demonstrate that 4LB5-HP-RNase efficiently impairs the
levels of miRNAs involved in malignancy of mammary
cancer cells resistant to conventional anti-cancer therapies,
and that this effect is due also to its enzymatic activity.
The release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from
tumor cells is increasingly attracting attention due to

Effects of 4LB5-HP-RNase on the levels of
oncogenic intracellular and extracellular
miRNAs
The critical role of NCL in microRNA biology
was recently revealed by the finding that NCL regulates
the maturation and expression of specific miRNAs,
including miR-21, miR-221, miR-222, that are involved in
the diverse phases of breast cancer development, and drug
resistance [11, 30–33]. To assess if the chimeric 4LB5HP-RNase protein affects the levels of these miRNAs,
triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells were
incubated with increasing doses of 4LB5-HP-RNase, and
the RNA was extracted after 72 hours of treatment. As

its role in cancer intercellular communication. A key
component of the EV-associated cargo are miRNAs, which
can be delivered to surrounding cells, and thus exert their
oncogenic role [34–36]. Since cancer cells release EVs into
surrounding tissues, which play pleiotropic roles in cancer
progression, namely, immune escape, neovascularization
and metastasis, we tested the effects of 4LB5-HP-RNase
on EV-packed miRNAs. Notably, oncogenic miR-21,
miR-221 and miR-222 were previously demonstrated to
be released by colon cancer cells and transferred to other
cancer cells, thereby mediating their aggressiveness [37].
To address the hypothesis that NCL protects cancer
cell-derived EV-associated miRNAs, we evaluated the
ability of anti-NCL 4LB5-HP-RNase and 4LB5 scFv
to modify the levels of EV-related miR-21 after the
binding and the possible displacement of microRNAs
from NCL. To this end, we first isolated EVs from the
conditioned serum-deprived medium of lymph node
metastatic derivatives of colorectal SW620 cancer cells
that are widely used as a model for exosome studies [38].
Then, using a combination of a polymer-based exosome
precipitation and a differential centrifugation approach
to fractionate the EV-containing medium, we isolated
the SW620-derived exosomes and tested them for the
presence of NCL by Western blotting (Figure 6E). Once
confirmed the presence of NCL, EVs were treated with
4LB5-HP-RNase or 4LB5 scFv at 50 nM for 2 hours at
37°C. Total RNA was extracted and exosome-related
miR-21 levels were analyzed by Real-Time PCR analysis.
RNU48 cellular snoRNA, served as a negative control,
to evidence the potential contamination of cellular RNAs
during the EV purification procedure Figure 6D. As shown
in Figure 6C, miR-21 levels were much lower in 4LB5HP-RNase-treated cells than in the untreated control,
whereas treatment with an equimolar dose of 4LB5, tested
in a parallel assay, only slightly affected miR-21 levels.
These data support the hypothesis that the binding of NCL
by the scFv 4LB5 may cause displacement of miRNAs
from NCL thus enabling the RNase moiety present in
4LB5-HP-RNase to degrade miR-21. Thus, the enzymatic
activity of 4LB5-HP-RNase could be responsible for its
more potent antitumor effects on extracellular miRNAs,
which indicates that the anti-NCL immunoRNase may play
a role in the inhibition of the inter-cellular communication
involved in tumor progression.

4LB5-HP-RNase, twice a week. Four weeks after the first
treatment, tumor volume was much smaller in 4LB5-HPRNase-treated mice than in control mice (Figure 7A), thus
indicating that 4LB5-HP-RNase exerts specific antitumor
activity in vivo. Compared with control mice, 4LB5-HPRNase treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth
(P = 0.0098).
To compare the in vivo antitumor effects of 4LB5HP-RNase with those observed for the parental 4LB5 scFv
[24], we performed a second in vivo experiment in the
same experimental model. Considering that the higher
molecular weight of IR, compared to that of the parental
scFv, could affect its permeation into large tumor masses,
mice were used bearing tumors of reduced size that were
injected with equimolar doses of 4LB5 or 4LB5-HPRNase [24]. As shown in Figure 7B, the antitumor activity
of 4LB5-HP-RNase was significantly stronger than that of
4LB5 (P = 0,0017) as well as a more significant reduction
of tumor size (a third of control set; P = 0,0005) was
observed in 4LB5-HP-RNase treated mice in comparison
with that observed (half of control set) in mice bearing
larger tumors. Interestingly, H&E staining shows several
areas of reduced cellularity, potentially compatible with
either activated tumor apoptosis or necrosis, after treatment
with 4LB5-HP-RNase (Figure 7C, upper panels). Similar
tissue alterations were also observed following 4LB5
treatment, in agreement with our previously published
data [24]. Furthermore, Ki-67 staining of treated tumors
(5–15% Ki67+ nuclei) indicates a reduced proliferation
rate compared with untreated controls (60% Ki67+ nuclei).
Notably, 4LB5 treatment resulted in a higher cytostatic
effect (slightly lower value of Ki67+ nuclei) compared to
that of 4LB5-HP-RNase, which is potentially compatible
with increased cytotoxic properties conferred by the HPRNase moiety to 4LB5. At the end of treatment, mice did
not show significant signs of wasting, such as increased
loss of weight (Figure 7D) or other detectable signs of
toxicity, in comparison with control-treated mice, thus
suggesting that neither 4LB5-HP-RNase nor 4LB5 exerts
toxic effects on normal tissues.

DISCUSSION
Despite the development of several targeted
therapies (monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine-kinase and
aromatase inhibitors) devised to transform breast cancer
into a chronic disease, many patients show primary or
acquired resistance to these anti-neoplastic drugs [39].
Indeed, unlike other types of breast cancer, for which
targeted biological therapies are available, no targeted
agent is yet available for TNBC. Consequently, new
strategies for TNBC are urgently needed.
A new target for breast cancer (including TNBC)
therapy is represented by Nucleolin (NCL). Nucleolin
is a highly conserved nucleocytoplasmic protein that
exerts many functional roles, localized in the nucleolus,

In vivo effects of 4LB5-HP-RNase
To determine the therapeutic potential of 4LB5HP-RNase in vivo, orthotopic mouse models of human
TNBC were generated by injecting surface-NCL-positive
MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells into the mammary fat pad
of non obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient
(NOD-SCID) mice. Two weeks post-injection of tumor
cells, mice were divided into tumor-weight-graded
groups, and injected i.p. with PBS solution or 2 mg/kg

nucleus and cytoplasm of the cell, which participates in
many cellular functions under both physiological and
pathological conditions. Recent reports show that NCL is
frequently up-regulated and selectively expressed on the
membrane cancer cells and cancer associated endothelial
cells, but not on normal cells [10, 12–14].
Nucleolin is also a member of the rRNA nucleolarprocessing complex [10, 40] and is directly involved
in miRNA biogenesis [41], including that of miR-10a,

miR-21, miR-103, miR-221 and miR-222. Since miR-21,
miR-221 and miR-222 up-regulation has been associated
with breast cancer aggressiveness and resistance to
antineoplastic therapies [16–19], NCL exerts a critical
pro-tumorigenic function by regulating their biogenesis
at the post-transcriptional level, thus enhancing their
maturation from pri- to pre-miRNAs [11].
Interestingly, miRNAs can also be detected in
extracellular compartments [42–45] where they are stably

“protected” because they are associated with RNA-binding
proteins and lipoproteins or they can be incorporated
into EVs [42, 46]. Furthermore, evidence of transfer
of miRNAs from the bound proteins to the exosomes
(and vice versa) [34], suggests a novel mechanism of
intercellular communication in which RNA-binding
proteins, such as NCL, may associate in complexes for the
packaging and export of these miRNAs, thereby protecting
them from protease degradation.
Given the continuous abundant expression of
NCL on the tumor surface, inhibitors of surface NCL
preferentially target tumor cells without affecting the
nuclear NCL of normal cells [10]. We previously selected
by phage display technology a fully human anti-NCL
scFv, called “4LB5”, specifically directed against NCL on
the cell membrane of cancer cells. This scFv selectively
binds to NCL-positive tumor cells, inhibits their growth,
and induces apoptosis. Furthermore, 4LB5 inhibits
the production of mature miR-21, -221, and -222, by
interfering in the NCL interaction with the microRNA
microprocessor complex and impairing the maturation of
precursors of these miRNAs [24].
Based on the ability of 4LB5 to translocate into
the cytoplasm after binding to NCL, this scFv can be
used to vehicle antitumoral molecules directly into
cancer cells and so enhance their therapeutic activity. To
evaluate this possibility, we engineered a novel anti-NCL

immunoRNase, called “4LB5-HP-RNase”, by fusing the
human scFv moiety with the human pancreatic RNase
(HP-RNase), thus combining the antitumoral activity of
4LB5 with the 4LB5-HP-RNase enzymatic activity of
the ribonuclease, which can be useful to degrade NCL
associated miRNAs or intracellular RNAs.
Here we describe the construction, characterization
and antitumor activity of the novel NCL-targeting
immunoRNase. We demonstrate that 4LB5-HP-RNase
retains the biological properties of both scFv and RNase.
In fact, the novel immunoRNase selectively and efficiently
binds to a panel of different surface-NCL-positive
breast cancer cells but not to normal cells, and shows
an enzymatic activity similar to that of the previously
characterized IR (Erb-HP-RNase) [25]. Moreover,
treatment with 4LB5-HP-RNase of breast cancer cells,
but not of normal cells, significantly reduces their
in vitro and in vivo growth by inducing both apoptosis
and necrosis. Notably, the effect of 4LB5-HP-RNase on
intracellular levels of tumorigenic miR-21, -221, and -222
in breast cancer cells is greater than that of 4LB5, which
indicates that the acquired enzymatic activity improves
the antitumoral efficacy of 4LB5 due to its ability to be
internalized by nucleolin, as shown by both cytosolic
and nucleolar localization of the immunoRNase (see
Figure 3C), which is in line with the natural distribution
pathway of NCL [23].

Figure 7: In vivo effects of 4LB5-HP-RNase on NCL-positive tumors induced in mice by using MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells. (A) NOD-SCID (n = 5) mice were injected with 2 × 106 MDA-MB-231-Luc cells into the mammary fat pad. After 2 weeks,

Finally, we report preliminary data suggesting that
NCL plays a key role in EV-mediated cancer intracellular
communication. In fact, we show for the first time that
NCL is present in the exosomes released from cancer
cells and that treatment with the anti-NCL immunoRNase
greatly reduces EV-associated miR-21 levels. These data
support the hypothesis that NCL is directly involved
in EV-mediated intracellular communication and that
molecules targeting NCL might be a means to impair this
communication. This concept can be verified in future
studies on the traffic of NCL and miRNAs in EVs and
their molecular association. Another possible approach
to test if the critical role of nucleolin is more involved
in the extracellular exosomes or in the intracellular
compartment could be represented by the construction of
a novel immunoRNase made up of 4LB5 and a variant of
HP-RNase made resistant to the intracellular Ribonuclease
Inhibitor (RI), a cytosolic protein with a high affinity
for HP-RNase [47, 48]. In this mutant protein, five
amino acids of the ribonuclease at the RI–HP-RNase
interface are replaced (R39D/N67D/N88A/G89D/R91D)
in order to reduce the affinity for RI but still retaining
high RNA-degrading activity [49]. If the efficacy of the
variant immunoRNase is increased by the resistance to
endogenous RI inhibition and the consequent antitumor
activity becomes more efficient than that of the parental
immunoRNase, described here, it will be possible not only
to shed light on the mechanism of action but also to obtain
a more potent immunoconjugate targeted to nucleolin in
the future.
In summary, here we describe a new approach
for the immunotherapy of TNBC based on a novel fully
human NCL-targeting immunoconjugate that is endowed
with potent antineoplastic activity. This treatment could
be beneficial in types of carcinoma ineligible for currently
available targeted therapies.

The following antibodies were used: horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-penta-His mouse
monoclonal antibody (Qiagen GmnH, Hilden, Germany),
anti-NCL mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA), anti-PARP rabbit
polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA, USA), anti-actin rabbit polyclonal antibody (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit
immunoglobulins from goat antiserum, HRP-conjugated
anti-mouse immunoglobulins from goat antiserum
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).

Construction, expression and purification of
4LB5–HP-RNase
The cDNA encoding the human pancreatic RNase
was cloned into the T7 promoter-based E. coli pET22b+
expression vector downstream to the sequence encoding
the available human 4LB5 scFv, followed by a spacer
included to minimize the steric hindrance between the two
moieties of the chimeric protein, as previously described
[47]. The recombinant plasmid was fully sequenced to
confirm the expected DNA sequence.
Cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 (Novagen,
Merk Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), previously
transformed with the recombinant pET22b+ expression
vector containing the cDNA of 4LB5-HP-RNase, were
grown at 37°C in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium containing
50 µg/ml ampicillin until the exponential phase was
reached. The expression of IR was induced by addition
of 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG;
Applichem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) in the cell
culture, which then was grown at room temperature
for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at
6,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Recombinant protein was
extracted from the insoluble fraction of pET22b(+)4LB5-HP-RNase-transformed BL21 (DE3) bacterial
cells. To this end, the fraction was solubilized in a PBS
buffer containing 7 M UREA and incubated by slowly
rotating overnight at 4°C in the presence of EDTA-free
protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science GmbH,
Manheim, Germany). After centrifugation at 28,000 g
for 20 min at 4°C the supernatant was incubated with
a 100% saturated solution (4 M) of ammonium sulfate,
added drop-wise at 4°C, to allow protein precipitation.
The mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 4°C under slow
stirring and then centrifuged at 28,000 g for 10 min at
4°C. The precipitated material was resolubilized in resin
binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, 10
mM imidazole pH 7.4) in the presence of 4 M UREA and
EDTA-free protease inhibitors, and incubated for a further
18 h at 4°C under slow stirring. After centrifugation at
28,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove unsoluble proteins,
the cleared supernatant was loaded on an immobilizedmetal affinity chromatography (IMAC) by incubation with

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures
MDA-MB-436, BT549 and SW-620 cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies,

cobalt-chelating resin (TALON®; Clontech, Palo Alto,
CA, USA) overnight at 4°C under gentle rotation. After
extensive washes in an appropriate buffer (20 mM sodium
phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) by decreasing
urea concentration in 10% glycerol (vol/vol), the elution
step was performed with the same buffer containing a
higher concentration of imidazole (250 mM). The purified
protein was analyzed by RNase zymograms, carried
out by SDS-PAGE electropherograms as previously
described [50]. Briefly, the gel was incubated in a buffer
of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 containing 25% isopropanol
for 30  minutes to increase the sensitivity of the signal
detection. The gel was equilibrated in a buffer of 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.4 for 30 minutes and then incubated in the
same solution containing 4 mg/ml yeast RNA (SigmaAldrich) at 37°C for 10 min. The gel was washed out
with a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and stained in
a solution of 0,2% toluidine blu containing 0,1% acetic
acid solution for 15 minutes at room temperature by gentle
agitation. Finally, the gel was destained by extensive
washes in water. Erb-HP-RNase was used as positive
control in a parallel assay.

To this end IR was pre-incubated for 2 hours at 4°C with
NCL-RBD recombinant protein by gentle rotation and
then tested on MDA-MB-231 cells as described above.

ELISA assays

In vitro cytotoxicity assays

Binding assays were performed by modified
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as
previously described [25]. ELISA assays for 4LB5-HPRNase or 4LB5 were performed on surface NCL-positive
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, BT549 or MCF-7 breast
cancer cells and surface NCL-negative MCF10a normallike breast cells. Briefly, all the cells were harvested in nonenzymatic dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich), washed
and transferred to U-bottom microtiter plates (2 × 105 cells
per well). After blocking with PBS containing 6% bovine
serum albumin (BSA), the cells were incubated in the
absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of
IR in ELISA buffer (PBS/BSA 3%) for 90 min at 25°C by
gentle shaking. After centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 7 min
and the removal of supernatant, cell pellets were washed
twice in 200 µl of PBS buffer, resuspended in 100 µl of
ELISA buffer and incubated for 1 h with a peroxidaseconjugated anti-Histidine tag antibody. After 1 h, the plates
were centrifuged, washed with PBS buffer and reacted
with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich). The
enzymatic reaction was stopped with 1 N HCl, and the
binding values were determined from the absorbance at
450 nm and reported as the mean of three determinations.
The SD (≤ 5%) was calculated on the basis of the results
obtained in three independent experiments.
To further confirm that the observed binding was
due to the specific interaction between 4LB5 and NCL
on cell surface, the binding of 4LB5-HP-RNase to MDAMB-231 cells was analyzed by ELISA assay before and
after its pre-incubation with equimolar doses (50 nM) of
NCL-RBD (RNA Binding Domain) recombinant protein.

MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells were plated
in 96-well plates at a density of 7 × 103 per well; BT-549,
MCF-7 and MCF10a cells at density of 1 × 104 per well.
Cells were treated with the increasing concentrations
(10–100 nM) of 4LB5-HP-RNase and incubated at 37°C
for 72 h. Cells counts were obtained with the Trypan blue
exclusion test or by MTT assay. For MTT assays, cells
were seeded in 96-well plates in complete growth media
and after 24 h, cell culture media were replaced with fresh
media in the absence or in the presence of 4LB5-HPRNase. After 72 h aliquots of MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) were
added to each well and plates were incubated at 37°C for
2–3 h. The reaction was monitored at A490 nm.
Cell survival is reported as percentage of viable cells
in the presence of the protein under test versus untreated
cells. Typically, cell survival values were obtained from
at least three independent experiments in which five
determinations were performed for each sample. Standard
deviations were calculated on the basis of the results
obtained from all the experiments.

Pull-down assay
Subconfluent MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested
and lysed in NETN lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM
EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1% [vol/vol] NP-40)
containing protease inhibitors. The BCA Protein Assay
kit was used to measure the concentration of the whole
cell extracts (WCEs). An aliquot of 2 mg of total protein
extract was incubated with equimolar doses (100 nM) of
4LB5 or 4LB5-HP-RNase, or with control buffer (PBS)
and loaded on Ni-NTA Magnetic Agarose Beads for 2 h
at room temperature under continuous stirring to enable
capture of the chimeric proteins. The resin was washed
out four times with 1 ml of NETN lysis buffer containing
0.25% NP-40. The samples were boiled in 2× SDS sample
buffer, run on SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF and
probed with appropriate dilutions of anti-NCL or anti-His
antibodies.

Colony assays
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 or BT-549 cells
(200 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and treated
with 100 nM 4LB5-HP-RNase or 4LB5 in complete
medium for 72 h. Then, cells were incubated with
complete medium without proteins and allowed to grow
for an additional 7 days to obtain the colonies. Cells were
then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, stained with
Crystal violet and counted.

measured with a caliper, and the volume was calculated
with the formula L × W × H. Tissue preparation and
staining were performed as previously reported [24]. At
least 10 different fields containing at least 100 cells each
were analyzed and counted for the relative abundance of
Ki67 positive and negative nuclei.

SW620 cells at 80–90% confluency were washed
twice with PBS and then incubated in serum-free RPMI1640 for 24 h to prevent potential contamination from
serum-derived vesicles and proteins. The conditioned
medium was collected and cells/cell debris was removed
from the cell culture supernatant with a combination of
differential centrifugation, as follows: 50 g for 20 min,
100 g for 20 min, 300 g for 10 min, 2000 g for 20 min
and 2000 g for 45 min. The cell culture supernatant was
recovered and further clarified by filtration through a
0.22 μm filter (Millipore). EVs were isolated by adding
ExoQuick™ exosome precipitation reagent according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations and incubated
overnight at 4°C to enable EV precipitation. The
ExoQuick/supernatant mixture was centrifuged at 1500 g
for 30 min and the supernatant was removed. The EV
pellet was resuspended in a sterile nuclease-free PBS
solution and incubated with equimolar doses of 4LB5 or
4LB5-HP-RNase (50 nM) at 37°C for 2 h or with a PBS
control solution.

Internalization experiments
Internalization of 4LB5-HP-RNase was assessed
by confocal microscopy. 4LB5 and 4LB5-HP-RNase
were Cy5-labeled using the LYNX Rapid Cy5 antibody
conjugation kit (AbD Serotec), according to the
manufacturer instructions. Sub-confluent MDA-MB-231
cells were seeded over a glass multi-well, treated with 1
μg/mL of Cy5-4LB5 or Cy5-4LB5-HP-RNase diluted in
complete medium and cultured at 37°C for 4 h to enable
their internalization. Cells were extensively washed
with PBS, and complete medium (without Cy5-labeled
antibodies) was replaced, after the addition of Hoechst
dye for nuclear staining. Live cell imaging was performed
by using an A1 plus laser-scanning, confocal microscope
equipped with a 60× oil objective lens (N.A. 1.4) (Nikon).
All imaging for the detection of Cy5 was performed by
using the same instrument settings. Images were processed
for presentation using NIS-Elements software (Nikon).
Imaris8 (version 8.2.0) was used to determine the Cy5 mean
fluorescent intensity and intracellular and extracellular
signals were segmented by using the DIC images.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was purified with the “RNA clean-up and
concentration” micro kit (Norgen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, after phenol/guanidine-based
extraction. For RNA extraction from EVs, Ath-miR159a
and cel-miR-248 synthetic oligos were added to each
sample to normalize the results of quantitative RT-PCR.
Quantitative real-time PCRs were performed with the
TaqMan Fast-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, using the appropriate
TaqMan probes for miRNA quantification, followed by
detection with the 7900HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). All reactions were performed in
triplicate. Simultaneous quantification of GAPDH was
used as reference for intracellular miRNA quantification.
Simultaneous quantification of RNU48 was used as
reference for exosome-related miRNA quantification.
The comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method for relative
quantification of gene and miRNA expression (User
Bulletin #2; Applied Biosystems) was used to determine
miRNA expression levels.

Statistical analysis
The values reported in the graphs were obtained
from at least three independent experiments in which
three determinations were performed for each sample,
and standard deviations were calculated on the results
of all the experiments. Results are expressed as the
mean + 1 standard deviation of the mean. The differences
between the mice groups in in vivo studies were analyzed
with unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. P < 0.05 was
considerated statistically significant and indicated with
asterisks as described in the Figure legends.

Study approval
Animal experiments were performed according to
the Ohio State University institutional guidelines after
review by the institutional review board.

In vivo antitumor assays
To test the in vivo activity of 4LB5-HP-RNase,
2 × 106 viable Luc+ MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into
the fourth left-side mammary fat pad of female NOD-SCID
mice (NOD/ShiLtSz; Charles River). Two weeks after
tumor cell inoculation, mice were treated twice a week with

or control buffer (PBS). After 4 weeks of treatment, mice
were euthanized and tumors excised. Tumor size was
