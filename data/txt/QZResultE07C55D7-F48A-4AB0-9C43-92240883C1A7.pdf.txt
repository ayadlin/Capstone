BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma can arise in either bone or soft tissue. The purpose of this study was to investigate
whether patient characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes differ between skeletal Ewing sarcoma and
extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma (EES). METHODS: Patients <40 years of age with Ewing sarcoma or peripheral primitive
neuroectodermal tumor reported to the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database
from 1973 to 2007 were evaluated based on skeletal (n ¼ 1519) versus extraskeletal (n ¼ 683) site of origin. Patient
characteristics were compared using Fisher exact tests. Overall survival was estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Patients with EES had a higher
mean age (19.5 vs 16.3 years; P < .001) and were less likely to be male (53.4% vs 63.3%; P < .001) or white (84.8% vs
92.5%; P < .001) compared with patients with skeletal tumors. Extraskeletal tumors were more likely to arise in axial
locations (72.9% vs 54.2%; P ¼ .001) but were less likely to arise specifically in the pelvis (19.8% vs 26.6%; P < .001).
Metastatic status or tumor size did not differ by group. Five-year overall survival was superior for localized EES compared with localized skeletal tumors (69.7% vs 62.6%; P ¼ .02). The hazard ratio for death in patients with localized
skeletal tumors compared with localized EES was 2.36 (95% confidence interval, 1.61-3.44) beyond 24 months from
initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics and outcomes differ among patients with EES compared
with patients with skeletal Ewing sarcoma. These findings may have important implications for patient care. Cancer

Ewing sarcoma is the second most common childhood primary bone cancer, though a substantial proportion of these
tumors arise from extraskeletal sites.1 Several studies have demonstrated the prognostic impact of tumor stage, size, site,
and age at diagnosis, with most studies focused on Ewing sarcoma of the bone.2-9 Few studies have directly compared
skeletal Ewing sarcoma with extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma (EES). Smaller studies have evaluated this population and
suggest that outcomes for patients with EES are at least similar to that of Ewing sarcoma of the bone.10-16 This finding has
also been observed in 2 recently reported multicenter clinical trials.1,17 However, these studies have focused on relatively
small numbers of patients and have not focused on all age ranges. Moreover, small sample sizes have precluded more
detailed analysis of the prognostic impact of skeletal versus extraskeletal origin of these tumors.
Based on the above-mentioned evidence, the extent to which the clinical characteristics and outcomes for skeletal Ewing
sarcoma and EES are similar or different is uncertain. Developing a better understanding of this relationship is important for
the development of future clinical trials. We hypothesized that EES has different tumor characteristics, treatment approaches,
and outcomes compared with skeletal Ewing sarcoma. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program (SEER), we evaluated this hypothesis in a cohort of patients diagnosed with either EES or skeletal Ewing sarcoma.

Original Article

January 1, 1973, the SEER program initiated the
collection and publication of cancer incidence, patient
demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology,
stage at diagnosis, limited treatment data, and survival
data.
Patients with histologically confirmed Ewing
sarcoma, Askin tumor, or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) between 0 and 39 years of age
were eligible for the study. This age range was chosen to
capture the majority of typical cases of Ewing sarcoma.
Patients with PNET were included because these tumors
are now believed to belong to the family of Ewing sarcoma.18 From 1973-2007, the 17 population-based
SEER registries reported 2221 cases of Ewing sarcoma or
PNET in patients <40 years of age. One patient with
melanotic neuroectodermal tumor was excluded from
analysis, because this is a distinct tumor from Ewing
sarcoma.19 We also excluded patients with unknown
skeletal versus extraskeletal status (n ¼ 18) because this
was the primary predictor variable of interest. The
remaining 2202 patients formed the analytical cohort for
this study.
Ewing sarcoma or PNET were classified in the
SEER database according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer and/or the International
Classification of Disease for Oncology, third revision
(ICD-O-3). Anatomical site codes were classified according to the ICD-O coding scheme. Patients were classified
as EES or skeletal Ewing sarcoma based on ICD-10-CM
coding used by the SEER database. These codes are
specific for bone versus soft tissue sites. Patients with the
following ambiguous tumor locations were excluded (n ¼
18): unknown; thorax NOS; orbit NOS; and palate
NOS. Patient characteristics and clinical presentation
were evaluated according to classification as EES or skeletal Ewing sarcoma. Variables of interest included sex,
stage (metastatic vs localized), year of diagnosis (in
sequential 5-year blocks), race (white vs non-white),
histology (PNET vs Ewing sarcoma), primary tumor site
(axial vs appendicular and pelvic vs non-pelvic), and
tumor size (<10 vs 10 cm in maximal dimension).
Data on treatment received were also collected. Data
regarding the use of surgery as local control were inconsistent and not believed to be reliable for further analysis.
Radiation therapy was dichotomized as not given or given
if delivered to any tumor site (primary and/or metastatic)
at any time point during treatment (including radioactive
implants and radioisotopes). For analysis related to use of
radiation, patients were excluded if they had missing data

3028

for radiation (n ¼ 19). Other treatment details, including
the use of chemotherapy, were not available.
Statistical Methods
Patient, tumor, and treatment categorical characteristics
were evaluated for differences between EES and skeletal
Ewing sarcoma using the Fisher exact test, with the
exception of year of diagnosis for which a chi-square test
was used. A 2-sided unpaired t test was used to compare
patient age between groups.
A logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate differences in the frequency of radiation use between
EES and skeletal Ewing sarcoma while controlling for
year of diagnosis, tumor location, age, and metastatic
status. This was further confirmed with a sensitivity
analysis that also controlled for size and included the
50.3% of patients for whom size data were available.
Overall survival from the time of diagnosis was
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and potential
differences between EES and skeletal Ewing sarcoma
were evaluated using the log-rank test. Overall survival
was expressed as Kaplan-Meier estimates with 95%
confidence interval (CI). The median follow-up time for
the analyzed cohort was 86 months.
Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess
the effect of EES versus skeletal origin on overall survival
while controlling for known prognostic factors. Visual
inspection of the univariate Kaplan-Meier curve comparing EES to skeletal Ewing sarcoma showed that the
survival functions crossed at 24 months. This suggested
that standard proportional hazards modeling might not
be appropriate. A formal test of the proportional hazard
assumption was performed using time-varying covariates
and confirmed violation of this assumption.20 We therefore constructed a model that allowed the hazards to differ
before and after 24 months from initial diagnosis. A
sensitivity analysis was performed that also controlled for
tumor size.
The SEER database was accessed using SEER*Stat
version 6.6.2. All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS version 9 and STATA version 10.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of the 2202 patients in the analytic cohort, 683 (31%)
had EES and 1519 (69%) had skeletal tumors. The

Calculated using chi-square analysis.

Significant differences in clinical presentation were
noted between EES and skeletal Ewing sarcoma. Patients
with EES had a higher mean age compared with patients
with bone tumors (19.5 versus 16.3 years; P < .001). To
explore this difference further, we also evaluated age in 5year categories. Compared with patients with skeletal
Ewing sarcoma, patients with EES were more likely to be
<5 (9.7% vs 4.9%; P < .001) or 35 (10.7% vs 3.4%; P
< .001) years old at initial diagnosis. Patients with skeletal
Ewing sarcoma were more likely to be male (63.3% vs
53.4%; P < .001) or white (92.5% vs 84.8%; P < .001)
compared with patients with extraskeletal tumors. Extraskeletal tumors were more likely to arise in axial locations
(72.9% vs 54.2%; P ¼ .001), though less likely to arise
specifically in the pelvis (19.8% vs 26.6%; P < .001).
EES was also more likely to have a histological classification of PNET versus Ewing sarcoma (P < .001) and be

diagnosed in more recent years (P < .001). There were no
differences in tumor size or metastatic status between EES
and bone tumors.
Use of Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy was used in 50.1% of all patients.
Patients with EES were less likely to receive radiation
compared with patients with skeletal tumors (42.3% vs
54.1%; P < .001). Given that the choice to utilize radiation treatment may be confounded by other patient and
tumor characteristics, we constructed a logistic regression
model to control for these potential confounders. After
controlling for age, tumor site, metastatic status, and year
of diagnosis, bone tumors continued to demonstrate
higher radiation rates compared to EES. The odds ratio
for receiving radiation for bone tumors was 1.48 (95%
CI, 1.20-1.82; P < .001). A sensitivity analysis that also
controlled for tumor size was performed and yielded
similar results.
Patient Outcomes
Among patients with localized disease, overall survival was
superior for patients with EES compared to patients with
skeletal tumors (P ¼ .02) (Figure 1). Five- and ten-year
Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival for localized
EES compared to localized skeletal tumors were 69.7%
(95% CI 64.7-74.2%) vs. 62.6% (95% CI 59.1-65.9%)
and 65.2% (95% CI 59.3-70.5%) vs. 55.3% (95% CI
51.5-58.8%), respectively. Among all patients with either
metastatic or localized tumors, overall survival did not
differ between EES and skeletal Ewing sarcoma. Similarly,
overall survival did not differ between patients with metastatic EES and metastatic skeletal tumors.

In order to evaluate this survival difference further,
we constructed a Cox proportional hazards model that
also controlled for age, year of diagnosis (in five year
blocks), tumor site, and race in patients with localized
tumors. Since the survival hazard for EES vs. bone origin
differed over time, we incorporated a time-varying covariate to allow the hazard ratio to differ before and after
24 months from initial diagnosis. This time point was
chosen based on inspection of the Kaplan-Meier overall
survival curve, indicating more favorable early outcomes
for patients with bone tumors and more favorable late
outcomes for patients with EES. From 0 to 24 months
after initial diagnosis, the hazard ratio for death for
patients with bone tumors was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.94)
compared to EES. After 24 months, the hazard ratio for
patients with bone tumors was 2.36 (95% CI, 1.61-3.44)
compared with EES. Other time points evaluated in the
range of 12-30 months yielded similar findings. A
sensitivity analysis that also controlled for tumor size was
performed and yielded similar results.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found significant differences in patient
demographics and other important clinical features
between skeletal Ewing sarcoma and EES. We also found
that patients with EES were more likely to be treated with
radiotherapy and that their overall survival was worse in
the first 24 months but better after 24 months compared
with patients with skeletal Ewing sarcoma. The differences in tumor characteristics and clinical behavior between
EES and skeletal Ewing sarcoma suggest that they may
have subtle biological differences.21 Some of these differences may arise from differences in the tumor microenvironment between Ewing sarcoma arising from the
bone versus an extraskeletal location. Our study represents
a significant advance from previous studies because it is
the largest and most comprehensive analysis of patient
characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes in EES
compared with skeletal Ewing sarcoma.
We clearly demonstrated that patient characteristics
differ between EES and skeletal tumors. Patients with
EES have a higher mean age, but also a bimodal distribution with EES more commonly found in those older than
35 years and less than 5 years compared with skeletal
tumors. This finding is consistent with prior reports.11
However, our study also noted other important differences between EES and skeletal tumors. Patients with EES
were less likely to be male, white, or have pelvic primary

3030

tumors, though they were more likely to have tumors arising in other axial locations. These extraskeletal tumors
were more likely to have a histological classification of
PNET and to be diagnosed more recently. The increased
proportion of extraskeletal tumors classified as PNET
may reflect changing nomenclature, because a common
misconception is that soft tissue origin is synonymous
with PNET histology.22 PNET histology has been
described in bone tumors,23 a finding we observed in
6.4% of osseous tumors in the current study. Similarly,
the increased number of cases reported in more recent
years likely reflects the more recent recognition and
reporting of EES as opposed to a true increase in the incidence of EES. In particular, improved cytogenetic and
molecular diagnostic methods now allow for more reliable
detection of genetic translocations characteristic of this
disease.
The use of radiation therapy for Ewing sarcoma has
evolved over the past several decades.24 Radiation has
generally become less common, though it still plays an
important role.25 We found that radiation therapy is
more common in skeletal Ewing sarcoma. This finding is
somewhat surprising, because more of these tumors were
in the extremities, a site that is typically more amenable to
surgical resection. Recognizing that the use of radiation
has diminished over time, we also controlled for year of
diagnosis with similar results. Therefore, the reasons for
this observation are unclear and require further study.
Smaller prior studies have suggested that outcomes
for EES and skeletal Ewing sarcoma are similar.9,12,15,26
Two prospective treatment studies have also shown similar outcomes for EES when treated with Ewing sarcoma
protocols.1,17 In contrast, our findings suggest that
outcome differences for patients with EES compared to
skeletal Ewing sarcoma are more complex. We found that
patients with localized EES have an unfavorable prognosis
prior to 2 years from initial diagnosis, but then the
outcomes for EES are significantly better. These results
were confirmed even after controlling for other known
prognostic factors. Of note, the magnitude of this difference was much greater after 24 months, suggesting that
the extraskeletal site has a greater impact on long-term
rather than short-term outcomes. It is possible that
patients with EES are diagnosed later in their disease
course compared with patients who have skeletal tumors,
causing a shift in the survival curve. This hypothesis cannot be tested using data available in the SEER database
and will require further study. There may also be other
biological or treatment differences that account for the

Cancer

Extraskeletal Ewing Sarcoma/Applebaum et al

observed increased early mortality seen in EES. Unfortunately, additional biological and treatment data are not
available from the SEER database, and these possibilities
cannot be further elucidated by this study. Finally, we
must be cautious in the conclusions we draw from this
finding, because our study involved patients over several
decades, and information about how these patients were
treated is limited. Nevertheless, these outcome differences
highlight the importance of further research in this area.
A main strength of this study is the large number of
EES cases analyzed using the SEER database. These results
are more representative of the general population, because
the database reflects many areas of the United States and
many different modalities of treatment. This strategy
enabled us to evaluate the largest group of EES patients
published to date to our knowledge. However, there are
several limitations to analyzing data from SEER that are
similar to any study using a tumor registry. We were
limited to the available data in the registry, which does
not provide information on cause of death, time to tumor
recurrence, or chemotherapy use. In addition, tumor
histology could not be independently confirmed. Most
importantly, site of origin in either bone or soft tissue
could not be confirmed. The definition of EES is not
standardized. Indeed, using the reported site of origin
data from SEER revealed regional differences in the
incidence of EES (data not shown). Nevertheless, the proportion of cases with EES (31%) out of all reported cases
of Ewing sarcoma is similar to prior reports.1
To develop the largest cohort possible, we included
patients diagnosed starting in the 1970s. The role of
chemotherapy and surgical treatments has evolved significantly over recent decades, which could have influenced
our results. It is also possible that cases of EES were misclassified in the past, because it has only been recognized
as a distinct entity more recently. To account for these
changes over time, we controlled for year of diagnosis in
our regression models and were able to confirm our univariate results. Another limitation is the paucity of data
for tumor size in the SEER database. Tumor size is a recognized prognostic indicator in patients with Ewing sarcoma.3,27,28 In the SEER database, tumor size was
unavailable for approximately half of the analyzed population. To address this, we performed sensitivity analyses
using size data among patients for whom these data were
available and obtained similar results to regression models
not including size.
Based on our findings, we conclude that there are
significant differences in clinical presentation, treatment

strategy, and outcomes for EES compared with skeletal
Ewing sarcoma. Our findings support the idea that EES is
an important subtype of Ewing sarcoma that may require
different treatment strategies. Future studies should investigate the biological basis for these differences. Additional
efforts should be directed at determining optimal treatment strategies to maximize outcomes in these tumors.
