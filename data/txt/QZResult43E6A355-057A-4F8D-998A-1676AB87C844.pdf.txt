BRAFV600E and Microenvironment in Thyroid Cancer:
A Functional Link to Drive Cancer Progression
Carmelo Nucera1,2, Jack Lawler2, and Sareh Parangi1

Abstract
Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) rates continue to increase in the United States and Europe, and, although most
patients do well, some recur and die of their disease. Patients with PTC harboring the BRAFV600E mutation seem
to display a more aggressive clinical behavior, but little is known about the role of this mutation in crucial
processes in the tumor microenvironment, such as tumor adhesion, migration, invasion, and metastasis. The
extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment is not merely a structural scaffold for the cellular elements of the
epithelial and stromal microenvironment, but it also elicits a profound influence on cell behavior affecting
viability, proliferation, adhesion, and motility. The effects of BRAFV600E on cell surface receptors (i.e., integrins)
and ECM noncellular components [i.e., thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and fibronectin (FN)] seem to trigger
different pathologic biological processes in a cell context–dependent manner. This review focuses on the recent
progress in understanding the role of BRAFV600E in the regulation of some ECM noncellular components and
trans-membrane receptors of the microenvironment in PTC in order to design novel targeted therapies directed
at the BRAFV600E multifaceted signaling cascades. Some of these targeted therapeutics, such as ATP-competitive
BRAFV600E inhibitors (i.e., orally bioavailable PLX4720 and PLX4032 compounds), are already under investigation. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2417–22. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing more
rapidly than other cancers in both the United States (1)
and other countries (2). Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)
originates in the follicular cells of the thyroid and represents one of the most frequent endocrine malignancies.
Well-differentiated PTCs typically have a favorable prognosis with thyroidectomy followed by thyroid hormone
suppressive therapy and radioactive iodine ablation of
normal thyroid tissue and any residual tumor in some
(3). However, for the group of patients who fail to respond
to this treatment paradigm or present initially with aggressive and refractory thyroid carcinomas, rates of neck recurrence and distance metastases are high and survival rates
are very low, and rational targeted therapies are being
investigated (3).

The BRAFV600E Mutation, Thyroid Cancer, and
Tumor Microenvironment
Molecular targets for recurrent PTC are mostly centered
on the RAS/BRAF/mitogen-activated extracellular signal
regulated kinase [MAPK; i.e., extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)] signaling pathway, given the prominence of this pathway as an oncogenic event in PTC progression (4). The BRAF gene is located on human chromosome
7q24 and encodes a cytosolic serine–threonine protein kinase
that is expressed in many human cells, including thyroid
follicular cells (5). The wild-type (wt) BRAF is activated at the
plasma membrane through a complex process that involves
RAS activity, phosphorylation events, and protein–lipid interactions. BRAF kinase exhibits a characteristic bilobar structure similar to all protein kinases. The inactive conformation
of BRAF involves the simultaneous binding of 14-3-3 to
phosphorylated sites S365 and S729 (6). The activated wt
BRAF is phosphorylated at site S446, leading to a maximally
negatively charged amino region. Extracellular signals (i.e.,
mitogens, hormones, and neurotransmitters) induce a tyrosine kinase receptor, act on RAS-GTP, and activate wt BRAF
(6, 7). Two conserved sites (T598 and S601) of wt BRAF are
oncogenic RAS-dependent phosphorylation sites. This event
not only renders BRAF constitutively active but also induces
ERK1/2 activation, causing cell transformation (6, 7).
Constitutive activation of the RAS-ERK signaling pathway is
common to numerous cancers. Approximately 15% of human
cancers have activating RAS mutations (8). More than 30
mutations of the BRAF gene associated with human cancers

have been identified, the majority of which are located within
the kinase domain (8). In 2002, Davies and colleagues (1)
identified an oncogene widespread among human cancers,
mutant BRAFV600E. BRAFV600E is expressed in different human
cancer cell lines including melanoma, colorectal cancer, and
thyroid cancer (4, 9). An activating mutation located on exon
15 of the B isoform of the RAF kinase gene results in a valineto-glutamic acid substitution at amino acid 600 (BRAFV600E).
The V600E mutation strongly enhances BRAF kinase activity
by inserting a negatively charged residue adjacent to the
phosphorylation site at T598 and mimicking phosphorylation
at Thr598 and Ser601 residues (7, 10), with increased ERK1/2
phosphorylation (8, 11). These molecular features render
BRAFV600E a unique kinase, able to elicit strong phosphorylation activity on ERK1/2, 480-fold higher than wt BRAF or other
BRAF mutants (8). This mutation is very prevalent in PTC and
is clearly seen much more frequently in the tumors with larger
size, lymphovascular invasion or metastases, and mortality,
and may play a role in the progression of PTC to anaplastic
thyroid cancer (ATC; refs. 4, 9, 12, 13).
Decades of research have shown that tumorigenesis is
strongly affected by nonmalignant cells (i.e., stromal cells)
that compose the tumor microenvironment (14). Interestingly,
a large number of genes abnormally expressed in human
cancer encode secreted proteins and receptors, with paracrine
and autocrine effects on other components of the tumor such
as stromal cells (e.g., fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial
cells, smooth muscle cells, T lymphocytes, and monocytes),
and extracellular matrix (ECM) noncellular components (15,
16). Dynamic and reciprocal interactions involving cell adhesion molecules (e.g., integrins, CD44), ECM noncellular components [i.e., thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), fibronectin (FN)],
and soluble cytokines occur between tumor epithelial cells
and tumor microenvironment stroma cells (17). The degree of
these interactions may represent the basis of triggering of
intracellular signaling pathways that confer tissue-specific
characteristics to the epithelium (17). The ECM is, therefore,
a fundamental component of cell microenvironment and has
been substantially expanded during the evolution of vertebrates. It provides more than mechanical support and is a
locus for cell adhesion, with potential roles in basement
membranes and tumors. All epithelial cells are in association
with basement membranes during their lives and include the
ECM. ECM composition and organization undergo radical
alterations in human cancers and could affect cell survival,
proliferation, adhesion, migration, and other properties of
both tumor and stromal cells.
Importantly, the BRAFV600E mutation has been associated
with aggressive clinical behavior in some patients with PTC
(4). Some data shed light on how the BRAFV600E oncogene
can affect the tumor microenvironment in thyroid cancer,
including interactions between neoplastic thyroid follicular
cells and ECM components. Deregulated pathways downstream of BRAFV600E in human cancers harboring this
mutation include tumor suppressor genes (i.e., TIMP-3), deregulation of microRNAs, and positive regulation of Skp-2
and NF-kB signaling (4). It has also been recently shown that
BRAFV600E expression correlates significantly with VEGF

2418

protein expression in PTCs with extrathyroidal invasion,
perhaps via BRAFV600E modulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (4). Mesa and colleagues have shown that BRAFV600Eactivated normal rat thyroid cells express genes such as matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP; i.e., MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13;
ref. 18). Traditionally, these enzymes may promote tumor
invasion by breaking down various noncellular components
of the ECM. It has been observed that PTC harboring
BRAFV600E show a more aggressive clinical-pathologic behavior (e.g., extrathyroid extension) and a significant increase in
MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels, thus suggesting that these
proteins may play a role in PTC progression (12).

The BRAFV600E Mutation and Extracellular
Matrix Noncellular Components
We have recently investigated the role of this single mutation in the gene expression patterns of PTC and ATC cells and
in the tumor microenvironment, leading to a better understanding in order to design future targeted therapies directed
at BRAFV600E signaling cascades (19). Our results suggest that
the BRAFV600E pathway plays an important role in PTC
progression through proteins crucial for the ECM remodeling
processes including tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion,
and metastasis (19). Using both in vitro and in vivo models
(i.e., orthotopic mouse models) of human thyroid cancer,
we found that TSP-1, a multifunctional molecule known to
have important effects on tumor stroma and endothelium,
serves as a mediator of invasiveness and aggressive tumor
behavior when the BRAFV600E mutation is present. Using a
novel technique based on genome-wide expression profiling
and designed to look at alterations in gene sets (gene set
enrichment analysis), we identified 17 upregulated gene sets
that were significantly associated with PTC with BRAFV600E
when compared with PTCs without the mutation or in normal
thyroid tissue. Many of these altered gene sets are involved in
the composition and remodeling of ECM such as TSP-1, TGFb1, integrin-a3, -a6, -b1, FN, CD44, cathepsin-B (CTS-B), and
cathepsin-S (CTS-S). These genes seem to be either targeted or
affected by the BRAFV600E mutation in PTCs (19). They might
act in concert and elicit important biological cross-talk during
tumor cell adhesion, migration, and invasion processes involving tumor microenvironment, and ultimately trigger thyroid
cancer progression (Fig. 1). Furthermore, our data showed
that decreasing mutant BRAF with knockdown, or using a
drug (PLX4720) designed to selectively deactivate BRAFV600E
in those thyroid cancer cells with at least one copy of mutant
BRAF, results in reversal of tumor migration and invasion and
metastasis, which is translatable to decreased tumor volume
in mice with orthotopic thyroid cancers 5 weeks after tumor
implantation (19).
For those familiar with the broad range of TSPs and their
important role in development, angiogenesis, and tumor
stroma, it is not surprising to find them implicated in
BRAF-mediated tumor progression. TSPs are a family of 5
secreted proteins that play distinct roles in development and
physiology, with TSP-1 and TSP-2 playing potential roles in
tumors. TSP-1 is not only the most abundant protein in

BRAFV600E and Tumor Microenvironment

Figure 1. The BRAFV600E oncoprotein activates the phospho-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and regulates the expression of ECM noncellular components. The
BRAFV600E oncoprotein dramatically elicits increased kinase activity and activates phospho-ERK1/2. This oncoprotein is constitutively active and does not
require RAS signaling. The BRAFV600E-activated phospho-ERK1/2 pathway is able to transform normal thyroid cells (NT) to thyroid cancer cells (TC). It
upregulates some ECM noncellular components (i.e., TSP-1, FN) and cellular trans-membrane receptors (e.g., integrins), which together may increase the
levels of phospho-ERK1/2 through a positive feedback driven by TSP-1. These pathologic processes trigger ECM remodeling and determine tumor cell
invasion into the lymphatic (LV) and/or blood vessels (BV) through the basement membrane, causing thyroid cancer progression.

a-granules of platelets but is also expressed in tumor stroma
(20). TSP-1 binds to a wide variety of integrins and nonintegrin
(i.e., proteoglycans) cell surface receptors, matrix proteins (i.e.,
FN), cytokines (i.e., TGF-b1), proangiogenic factors (e.g.,
VEGF), and matrix proteases (i.e., MMP-9), indicating its
importance in cross-talk between surface receptors; serves
as a key regulator of tumor cell adhesion and migration,
metastasis, and angiogenesis; and may direct clustering of
receptors to specialized domains for these biological processes. TSP-1 influences VEGF activity by inhibiting the
activation of MMP-9 and suppressing the release of VEGF
from the ECM and is also a major activator of TGFb1 (20).
Whereas the role of TSP-1 as an antiangiogenic factor is
well documented (20), its biological action in tumor progression and metastasis is still controversial. Yee and colleagues have recently shown that TSP-1 can promote
metastasis to lungs in a transgenic mouse model of breast
cancer (21). We have shown that TSP-1 knockdown in

www.aacrjournals.org

aggressive human thyroid cancer cells harboring BRAFV600E
prevents the progression of this cancer by resulting in
decreased phospho-ERK1/2 protein levels and reduced cell
proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion, as well as
metastasis in vivo (19). In addition, the G1 arrest of these
cells shows that TSP-1 promotes cell cycle progression (19).
Overall, these results suggest that TSP-1 can be considered a
regulator of the thyroid cancer microenvironment, eliciting
promigratory and proinvasive roles in thyroid cancer cells
harboring BRAFV600E (19). By contrast, mutated RAS is able
to repress TSP-1 expression via the c-myc oncogene or
activation by the RAF/ERK pathway in human breast cancer
models (22), and loss of p53 function has been shown to
correlate with reduction in TSP-1 expression and a switch to
a proangiogenic phenotype in fibroblasts derived from a
patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (20). Overall, varied
TSP-1 expression is regulated differently depending on the
genetic context of the cells.

Nucera et al.

Our results also point to the importance of certain key
integrins (i.e., a3b1 and a6b1) that showed significantly
higher mRNA levels in BRAFV600E-positive PTC compared
with wt BRAF PTC or normal thyroid tissue and may
mediate thyroid tumor cell migration and invasion (19).
Some integrins mediate tumor cell–ECM adhesion and
provide both the connection to the adhesive substrate
and cellular signaling (known as "outside-in" signaling or
extracellular to intracellular), crucial for cell proliferation,
migration, and invasion (17). Some integrins (e.g., a2b1 in
breast cancer cells) are decreased as tumors progress, thus
suggesting that a2b1 could function as a tumor suppressor,
whereas elevated expression of integrin b3 seems to be
closely associated with melanoma progression (23). Interestingly, a5b1 integrins may become activated upon p53
mutation and reflect an enhanced FN-binding integrin (24).
We also found a potential link between FN and BRAFV600E in
our analysis (19); BRAFV600E-positive PTCs showed significantly higher FN mRNA levels compared with wt BRAF PTC
or normal thyroid tissue. Our data support the hypothesis
that FN overexpression may be involved in cancer progression harboring BRAFV600E and may influence the control of
metastasis by mediating integrin-associated signaling pathways. Human cells mediate FN matrix assembly through
integrins binding to the RGD cell-binding domain. Integrin
a5b1 is the primary receptor for FN matrix assembly, which
binds to the RGD sequence (Arg-Gly-Asp; ref. 17). Importantly, melanoma cells overexpress FN, which controls many
fundamental pathobiological processes. There is strong evidence that overexpression of FN is tightly correlated with
the acquisition of invasive and metastatic behavior of melanoma cells by constitutive BRAFV600E/ERK kinase signaling
(25). FN binding to integrin induces receptor clustering,
which brings together cytoplasmic molecules such as focal
adhesion kinase (FAK), Src kinase, paxillin, and others to
form protein-rich focal complexes that activate polymerization of actin filaments and intracellular signaling through
kinase cascades (26). FAK activation by integrin–ligand
interactions promotes PI3K signaling, which is essential in
promoting cancer invasion. In addition, Shibue and Weinberg have recently shown that integrin b1 is also fundamental in activating the FAK signaling axis to control the
initial proliferation of micrometastatic mouse breast cancer
cells disseminated in the lungs (27).
In addition to FN–integrin interactions, TSP-1–integrin
interaction also contributes to initiate "outside-in" signal
transduction events that modulate gene expression, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (17). TSP-1 has many
important functional interactions through its various
domains, some of which (3TSR domain or termed as type-1
repeats) play an important role in activation of TGF-b1 in vivo
(20). Our data showed that the N terminus of TSP-1 seems to
be the critical element involved in the BRAF-mediated invasion in thyroid cancer cells (19). Chandrasekaran and colleagues (28) also showed a critical role for the TSP-1 N-terminal
domain in breast cancer cell invasion via putative binding site
(s) to integrin a3b1, which has an important role for tumor
cell migration and invasion. Sumimoto and colleagues (29)

2420

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

have shown that BRAFV600E knockdown downregulated
phospho-ERK1/2 protein levels and inhibited Matrigel invasion of melanoma cells, accompanied with a decrease of MMP
activity and integrin b1 expression. These results clarify that
the mutated BRAFV600E is essentially involved in a malignant
phenotype of melanoma cells by regulating genes involved
in ECM remodeling through ERK1/2 activation and would,
thus, serve as an attractive molecular target for melanoma
treatment.
TSP-1 also binds FN directly (30) or indirectly through
TSG6 (also called TNF-stimulated gene 6, a secreted protein
that is produced during inflammation processes; ref. 31). The
binding by FN to TSP-1 induces conformational changes in
TSP-1 that enhance the ability of TSP-1 to be recognized by
integrin a3b1 (30); such interactions seem to enhance FN
matrix assembly and increase adhesive properties of TSP-1 to
integrins. In addition, Decker and colleagues have shown that
FN can form a complex with integrin a4b1 and TSP-1; the
a4b1/FN/TSP1 complex increased adhesion of osteosarcoma
cells (32).

Targeting BRAFV600E-Positive Human Cancers
with Orally Available Selective Inhibitors
(PLX4720 and PLX4032)
Recent advances in understanding the molecular
changes that take place in human tumorigenesis have
led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies that
are based on various molecular targets. Pharmacologic
targeting of BRAFV600E may provide selective and rational
advantages for treatment of patients with PTC harboring
this mutation. Two Plexxikon compounds, PLX4720 and
PLX4032, are novel, orally available selective small-molecule inhibitors of BRAFV600E that have been specifically
designed to insert into the ATP-binding site and trap
oncogenic BRAFV600E in an inactive conformation (33,
34). Consistent with their high degree of selectivity for
the mutant BRAFV600E, these compounds inhibit BRAFV600E
kinase activity both in melanoma and colorectal cancer
cells, leading to the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
and G1-phase cell cycle arrest (33, 34). PLX compounds
show efficacy against either homozygous or heterozygous
BRAFV600E-mutated cell lines and animals with tumor
implantation (i.e., melanoma, colorectal cancer, or ATC;
refs. 19, 33, 34).
It has been shown that these ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors could have unexpected effects in some cell and
genotype contexts (e.g., presence of wt BRAF along with
mutated RAS), because of ERK1/2 hyper-phosphorylation by
dimerization between wt BRAF with another RAF isoform,
CRAF (35–37). The results from these aforementioned studies highlight the importance of individualized genomic
profiling to guide patient selection for inclusion in targeted
therapy trials.
Recently, phase I and II clinical trials in patients with
BRAFV600E-positive melanomas have shown a partial or
complete response to PLX4032, even though duration of

BRAFV600E and Tumor Microenvironment

the response to this inhibitor is yet unknown (38). PLX4032
induced complete or partial tumor regression in 81% of
patients who had melanoma with the BRAFV600E mutation.
Responses were observed at all sites of disease, including
the bone, liver, and small bowel (38). Most side effects
related to PLX4032 seemed to be proportional to the dose
and exposure to the drug. Cutaneous side effects, fatigue,
and arthralgia were the main clinical problems in the
treated patients. Thirty-one percent of these patients treated with PLX4032 developed skin lesions described as
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthoma. These skin lesions generally appear within a
few months of treatment initiation in sun-exposed areas
of skin, suggesting that preexisting oncogenic mutations
may potentiate the RAF inhibitor effects (34). This druginduced effect is of particular interest because other RAF
inhibitors such as sorafenib (used in clinical trials, either
alone or in combination with chemotherapy that has not
had significant antimelanoma effects) also caused these
skin lesions in a subset of treated patients (38, 39). The
ability of PLX4032 to cause tumor regression in a large
proportion of patients with BRAFV600E, advanced-stage,
metastatic melanoma provides strong support for the
hypothesis that the BRAFV600E protein is a dominant driver
of tumor growth and maintenance. However, in some
patients with BRAFV600E mutation–positive melanoma,
the tumors showed resistance without evidence of an early
response, and the mechanism of this primary resistance
(refractory state) is still unknown. Importantly, results from
an advanced human thyroid cancer preclinical model using
PLX4720 (19, 40) suggest that these inhibitors might be an
effective therapy in clinical trials for the treatment of
patients with BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancers that are
refractory to conventional therapy.

Conclusions and Perspectives
In summary, the BRAFV600E mutation may affect the expression of tumor ECM noncellular components and alters the
microenvironment in PTC. The molecular action of this oncogene seems to affect both the migratory and invasive properties
of the thyroid cancer cell itself as well as components of the
tumor ECM microenvironment. Knowledge about these new
downstream targets of BRAF may help identify biomarkers (i.e.,
secreted factors) and/or targets for innovative therapeutic
strategies in BRAFV600E-positive human cancers. Therapeutic
strategies aimed at modulating the host microenvironment (i.e.,
ECM cellular and noncellular components) may offer a complementary perspective for the treatment of patients with these
types of cancers. It will be of considerable interest, therefore, to
reveal the spectrum of molecular mechanisms underlying the
signaling cross-talk of the tumor microenvironment and to
determine the extent to which they participate in the aberrant
behavior of BRAFV600E-positive human cancer cells.
