BACKGROUND: The multinational MABEL study of 1147 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who had
recently failed an irinotecan-containing regimen confirmed in a community practice setting the efficacy and safety of
cetuximab combined with irinotecan. METHODS: This report describes a post hoc analysis of the influence of prophylactic premedication on the incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in the MABEL study. The analysis was
focused on the subpopulation of patients premedicated with antihistamines either with (n ¼ 700) or without (n ¼
422) corticosteroids. Stepwise Cox regression modeling was used to examine the explanatory value of the type of
premedication on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times. RESULTS: The incidence of IRRs
was lower in the group of patients who received antihistamine plus corticosteroid (9.6%) compared with those who
received antihistamine alone (25.6%). A similar trend was seen for grade 3 or 4 IRRs (1.0% vs 4.7%, respectively). The
12-week PFS rates (61% vs 60%), median PFS (16.1 vs 13.1 weeks) and OS (9.2 vs 9.0 months) times for patients who
received, respectively, antihistamines with and without corticosteroids were similar. Cox regression modeling did not
identify any impact of type of premedication used (antihistamine with or without corticosteroids) on the efficacy of
treatment in relation to PFS or OS. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactically premedicating mCRC patients with both antihistamine and a corticosteroid appeared to reduce the frequency of cetuximab-associated IRRs. Given that this was a
post hoc analysis, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of these data, which require formal confirmation in

KEYWORDS: hypersensitivity, monoclonal antibody, prophylaxis, epidermal growth factor receptor, MABEL.

The development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for proteins associated with tumor tissue has

provided valuable and effective new components for contemporary anticancer regimens.1,2 In common with many other
types of anticancer agents, such as platinum analogs,3,4 taxanes,5 and epothilones,6 therapeutic MoAbs, such as cetuximab,
panitumumab, bevacizumab, rituximab or trastuzumab, can induce hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions (IRRs).7
Although the exact mechanism responsible for such reactions is generally not clear and may well differ for individual
agents and/or patients, the majority of IRRs are consistent with type I hypersensitivity responses, which are caused by the
rapid release of immune modulators and inflammatory cytokines from responsive cells in tissues following exposure to a
therapeutic agent.7-9

Cetuximab is an immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 MoAb
that specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition to competitively inhibiting
ligand-binding and receptor-dependent downstream signal transduction, cetuximab can also trigger an antitumor
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reaction.10-13 Initially demonstrated in the pivotal BOND
study, in which patients who failed a prior irinotecanbased regimen on or within 3 months of treatment were
randomly assigned to receive either cetuximab or cetuximab combined with irinotecan, the efficacy of cetuximab
in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been confirmed in a series of further
randomized studies.14-18 In the first-line setting, the large
randomized phase 3 CRYSTAL study, which included a
primary analysis population of 1198 patients with
mCRC, demonstrated that the addition of cetuximab to
FOLFIRI reduced the risk of disease progression (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.68; P ¼ .02) and increased the chance for
response (odds ratio [OR], 1.91) compared with FOLFIRI alone in evaluable patients whose tumors were wildtype at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.17 Furthermore, in the randomized phase 2 OPUS study, which
included 337 patients with mCRC, the addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX-4 as first-line treatment was also shown
to confer meaningful clinical benefit in the subgroup of
analyzed patients whose tumors were wild-type for
KRAS.18 Notably, for these patients, the risk of disease
progression was lower (HR, 0.57; P ¼ .0163) and the
chance of response higher (odds ratio 2.54; P ¼ .011) in
the cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 arm compared with the
FOLFOX-4 alone arm. These studies demonstrated that
in patients whose tumors were wild-type for KRAS, the
addition of cetuximab improved the efficacy of standard
first-line regimens used in the treatment of mCRC.
Throughout the clinical development process,
cetuximab-associated IRRs were commonly noted. Such
reactions were generally mild to moderate, but have been
reported to be severe in 1%-10% of cases,19 and in rare
instances, have been fatal.20,21 Approximately 90% of
severe IRRs occur in association with the first cetuximab
infusion.22 In the early days of cetuximab development,
an initial test dose of cetuximab (20 mg) was administered
in an attempt to identify patients who might experience
IRRs. However, this practice was discontinued when it
became apparent that this test dose did not reliably identify all patients at risk of severe IRRs.22
Including 1147 patients, and representing the largest such study published to date, the Monoclonal Anti-

1828

body Erbitux in a European Pre-License (MABEL) study
was designed to provide additional safety and efficacy information on the combination of cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients who had progressed on or within 6 months
of treatment on a per protocol-defined, irinotecan-based
regimen as their most recent therapy, and to confirm the
findings of the BOND study in a wider standard community practice setting.21 The progression-free survival
(PFS) rate at 12 weeks in the MABEL study was 61% and
an estimated median overall survival (OS) time of 9.2
months was achieved in the community setting, which,
despite the caveats associated with cross-study evaluations,
is comparable to the 8.6 months reported for the BOND
study. Treatment was generally well tolerated, with the
toxicity profile as expected for the individual agents. A
post hoc analysis of the safety data from the MABEL study
investigated the incidence of IRRs according to the type
of premedication administered and whether the type of
premedication affected the efficacy of treatment. These
descriptive retrospective analyses form the basis of the current report.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design, Eligibility and Treatment
The MABEL study was a multinational, uncontrolled,
single-arm study in patients with EGFR-expressing
mCRC who had previously failed irinotecan-based therapy for metastatic disease. In relation to their most recent
chemotherapy regimen, they were to have failed prior
treatment lasting for a period of at least 6 weeks with 1 of
4 predefined irinotecan regimens (Fig. 1), as evidenced by
imaging-based progression of disease on or within 6
months of that treatment. Other key inclusion criteria
were as described.21 All patients provided written
informed consent before the initiation of any study related
procedures.
Patients received cetuximab, as an initial 2-hour
infusion of 400 mg/m2 followed by weekly 1-hour infusions of 250 mg/m2, combined with irinotecan, on 1 of 3
schedules, according to the regimen on which they had
previously failed (Fig. 1). The primary objective of the
study was to determine the rate of patients free of disease
progression 12 weeks after the initiation of cetuximab
plus irinotecan treatment. Secondary objectives included
the further evaluation of PFS, OS, and the safety and toxicity of the cetuximab plus irinotecan combination, with
particular attention given to the occurrence of adverse

events (AEs) considered to be cetuximab-associated, ie,
IRRs and skin reactions.
IRRs
A broad special AE category representing IRRs was
defined during the course of the study. In addition to the
single terms, hypersensitivity or allergic/allergoid reaction, this composite category also included a wide range
of selected Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA v8.1) preferred terms describing AEs that were
likely to be a direct systemic reaction to cetuximab infusion. Certain events were categorized as IRRs only if they
occurred on the same day as the first cetuximab infusion,
with others viewed as an IRR if they occurred at any time
during treatment (Table 1).
Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were to be managed according to protocol-specified guidelines (Table 2).
A decrease of the infusion rate was recommended in case
of grade 1 or 2 reactions. Once the cetuximab infusion

Cancer

rate had been decreased because of the occurrence of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction, it was to remain decreased
for all subsequent infusions. If the patient had a second allergic/hypersensitivity reaction at the slower rate, then the
infusion was stopped and the patient was removed
from the study. If a patient experienced a grade 3 or 4
allergic/hypersensitivity reaction, then cetuximab was
discontinued.
Prophylactic Premedications
Prophylactic premedication was defined as medication
given on the date of the first cetuximab infusion irrespective of the reason for treatment. In accordance with the
product label, all patients were to receive antihistamine
prophylactic premedication before the first infusion of
cetuximab to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. For all
subsequent weekly doses, it was also recommended that
patients receive an appropriate antihistamine prophylactic
premedication. However, according to the preference of

into 4 groups based on coding according to the World
Health Organization-Drug Reference List (WHO-DRL)
dictionary and medical review: antihistamine alone, corticosteroid alone, antihistamine plus corticosteroid, and
neither antihistamine nor corticosteroid (the listed treatments could in all cases have been accompanied by other
than the mentioned medications). The post hoc IRR analyses were performed on the 2 largest subsets of patients;

those who received antihistamine alone or antihistamine
plus corticosteroid. Patients in the ‘‘corticosteroid alone’’
and ‘‘neither antihistamine nor corticosteroid’’ premedication groups were excluded from the analysis set, given
that the small number of patients involved (n ¼ 25, in
total) would have precluded the drawing of meaningful
conclusions in these groups.
Study Assessments
Radiological imaging (computed tomography, CT or
magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) was to be performed

at baseline and at 12-week intervals, or whenever disease
progression was suspected. Progression was assessed
according to modified WHO criteria with bi-dimensional
measurement of index lesions. Premedication was
recorded on a special case report form at the first infusion
but could also have been reported as concomitant medication if given on multiple occasions. AEs and concomitant
medication were recorded at each of the weekly infusion
visits.

Statistical Methods and Considerations
PFS time was defined as the duration from the first
administration of cetuximab to the first observation of radiologically (CT/MRI) documented progression, discontinuation of treatment because of symptomatic
deterioration (unless radiological imaging confirmed absence of progression), or death within 120 days after last
tumor assessment, whichever occurred earlier. All univariable time-to-event analyses were based on Kaplan-Meier
methods23 and are presented by premedication subgroup
and overall. The confidence interval (CI) for the median
time-to-event was calculated according to Brookmeyer
and Crowley24 and rates at defined time points were
derived from the Kaplan-Meier curves together with their
corresponding 95% CIs.
In the overall population, a stepwise Cox regression
model25 for PFS time served to identify statistically important prognostic factors from a set of a priori specified
variables.21 This model was then further used to examine
the explanatory value of the type of premedication on PFS
and OS times, as evaluated by a likelihood ratio test comparing a model including all identified prognostic factors
with a model in addition including the type of
premedication.

RESULTS
Patient Subgroups and Baseline
Characteristics
A total of 1147 patients were treated and included in the
intent-to-treat (ITT) evaluation of efficacy and safety. Of
the 1147 ITT patients, a total of 1122 patients were premedicated with antihistamines with (n ¼ 700) or without
(n ¼ 422) corticosteroids. The range of compounds used
as premedication in the 2 subgroups is listed in Table 3.
For 25 patients, there was no record of receipt of antihistamines before the first infusion. Given the small size of
this group, these 25 patients were excluded from the post
hoc IRR analysis.

The majority of patients who were premedicated
with corticosteroids received dexamethasone intravenously, with oral application used in approximately 15%
of patients. In the majority of cases, the dexamethasone
dose was 8 mg. Patient and disease characteristics at
baseline according to premedication treatment group are
given in Table 4. Premedication groups were well-balanced with respect to these characteristics. The majority
of patients (77%) had a date of progression 30 days
from the end of the previous irinotecan treatment.
Incidence of IRRs
The incidence of IRRs related to the premedication
administered is shown in Table 5. The incidence of any
IRR was lower in the group of patients who received antihistamine plus corticosteroid (67 of 700 patients, 9.6%)
compared with those who received antihistamine alone
(108 of 422 patients, 25.6%). A similar trend was seen for
grade 3 or 4 IRRs (7 of 700 patients, 1.0% for any antihistamine plus corticosteroid vs 20 of 422 patients, 4.7%
for patients receiving antihistamine alone). The most
common IRRs at any grade according to System Organ
Class categories were general disorders and administrative
site conditions (mainly pyrexia) followed by immune system disorders (mainly hypersensitivity). The most common grade 3 or 4 IRRs were immune system disorders
(mainly hypersensitivity), followed by respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (mainly dyspnea) (Table
6). Where the time of onset was available, most infusionrelated reactions of any grade regardless of the type of premedication were reported to occur within the first 3 hours
following cetuximab infusion (74 of 125 instances; 59%).
The majority of grade 3 and 4 reactions also occurred
within the first 3 hours following cetuximab infusion (20
of 24 instances; representing 83% of cases where time of
onset was available). One patient who received

61% for patients who received antihistamine plus corticosteroid compared with 60% for those who received antihistamine alone as premedication. Median PFS (16.1 vs
13.1 weeks, respectively) and OS (9.2 vs 9.0 months,
respectively) times for patients in the 2 premedication
groups were also similar, especially when considering the
overlap of the confidence intervals. Cox regression analyses on PFS time did not identify any impact of type of

premedication on the efficacy of treatment according to a
model adjusted for a range of prognostic factors including:
tumor stage at diagnosis, Karnofsky performance status,
number of previous nonadjuvant treatment lines, best
response to most recent irinotecan schedule, country,
number of metastatic sites, and body surface area, (likelihood-ratio test P ¼ .33). Comparable results were seen
with Cox regression analyses on OS time (likelihood ratio
test P ¼ .81).

DISCUSSION
Although entry criteria for the BOND and MABEL studies required that patients had progressed on or within
respectively either 3 or 6 months of receiving a prior irinotecan-based regimen, it should be noted that 77% of the
patients in the MABEL study had a progression date 30
days from the end of the previous irinotecan treatment.
Therefore, despite the differences in protocol design and
the difficulties implicit in cross-study comparisons, the
MABEL study efficacy data may be viewed as consistent
with the earlier BOND study, and further suggested that
the benefit conferred by the addition of cetuximab to irinotecan in the treatment of patients with mCRC whose
disease has failed prior irinotecan-based therapy was transferable to the community setting.14,21 This large study
also confirmed that the cetuximab plus irinotecan combination is generally well-tolerated, with the incidence and
severity of AEs similar to that reported in the combination
arm of the BOND study.

1834

Special attention was given in the safety analysis to
the incidence of cetuximab-associated AEs, in particular,
skin toxicity (a class effect of EGFR-targeted therapeutics)
and IRRs. In common with many anticancer agents,
including other MoAbs, severe IRRs may develop following cetuximab administration, albeit in a small number of
patients. Although some studies report individual AEs
that each in themselves represent a hypersensitivity-type
reaction to the administered agent, in the current study, a
wide range of such AEs were incorporated to define the
IRR special combined AE category. Care must, therefore,
be taken when drawing comparisons of the incidence of
IRRs between the current MABEL analysis and other
studies, which may have reported the incidence of this
type of reaction according to individual preferred terms,
such as hypersensitivity.
Nevertheless, using this wide IRR definition to
assess the MABEL safety data, the analysis of patients who
received antihistamine premedication indicated that the
overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 IRRs in this group was
2.4%, a figure that falls within the expected range from
previous studies and which is in line with the current
cetuximab Summary of Product Characteristics guidance.19 Most interestingly, post hoc analysis of the IRR
data according to the type of premedication suggested
that the occurrence of such reactions might be reduced by
the addition of corticosteroids to antihistamine prophylactic regimens, with only 1.0% of patients receiving such
pretreatments experiencing grade 3 or 4 reactions compared with an incidence of 4.7% for those receiving

antihistamines alone. A corresponding reduction was
apparent for any grade of IRR, as well as for the more serious grade 3 and 4 reactions. Of key importance, the post
hoc analysis did not identify any impact of type of premedication on the efficacy of treatment in relation to PFS
or OS. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 IRRs in patients
receiving corticosteroid plus antihistamine premedication
in the current study is therefore comparable to that
reported for patients receiving the EGFR-targeting IgG2
monoclonal antibody, panitumumab.26 However, the efficacy of this agent has not been demonstrated in the firstline treatment of mCRC.27
In seeking to interpret the current data, several factors should be considered. In particular it should be noted
that this was a nonprotocol-specified post hoc analysis
based on observations made during the evaluation of the
MABEL study safety data. This category of investigation
can be subject to some degree of observational bias. It
should also be noted that premedication type was not
assigned randomly. In addition, the possibility that channeling bias, the selection of the type of premedication by
the physician according to patient factors, which may
have had a bearing on the measured outcome, might have
contributed meaningfully to the difference in IRR frequency between the groups and cannot be excluded. For
these reasons, it was not deemed to be appropriate to perform a formal test to ascertain whether the difference in
incidence of IRRs between the groups according to the
type of premedication was statistically significant.
On a broader level, consideration has been given in
several studies to variation in the standard approved cetuximab regimen and associated clinical practice. Pfeiffer and
colleagues have demonstrated that increasing the dose of
cetuximab to 500 mg/m2, administered every 2 weeks,
does not appear to increase the rate of occurrence of grade
3 or 4 anaphylactic reactions (as distinct from the incidence of IRRs as defined in the current analysis) in comparison with patients receiving the standard 400 then 250
mg/m2 weekly cetuximab regimen (1 of 74; 1.4% vs 3 of
65; 4.6% of patients, respectively).28 In patients who are
susceptible to IRRs, it has been reported that continuing
antihistamine prophylaxis and slowing the infusion rate
may provide a means to clinically manage the reactions
and perhaps to maintain therapy.29 More generally, the
question remains open as to whether antihistamine premedication to minimize the occurrence or severity of
IRRs is required for all cetuximab applications, or just for
the initial 1 or 2 applications. Timoney and colleagues in
a retrospective analysis of 115 patients who received a

Cancer

April 1, 2010

total of 746 applications of cetuximab without diphenhydramine premedication reported that no severe lifethreatening reactions had occurred.30 They concluded
that the omission of antihistamine premedication after
the initial 2 applications of cetuximab did not appear to
alter the safety profile, and that the routine long-term use
of such premedication did not appear to be warranted. It
should also be noted that there are currently no data on
the incidence of cetuximab-associated IRRs when a
patient is re-challenged following an initial grade 3 or
4 reaction, nor on whether graded re-challenges (under
the supervision of an allergy specialist) ultimately allow
the resumption of treatment at the standard infusion
rate.
The specific cause or causes of the AEs that comprise IRRs have not yet been definitively identified.
However, it has been noted that the timing of onset of
grade 4 allergic/hypersensitivity-type reactions, which
often occur within minutes of the first infusion, might
be different from that of a subset of less severe reactions, which may develop after multiple infusions.31
This could perhaps suggest the existence of different
biological mechanisms involved in IRR causality. Certain patient characteristics have also been proposed that
might be predictive for a higher risk for the development of cetuximab-associated IRRs. In particular, studies have associated a history of prior significant
allergies32 or the presence of pre-existing cetuximab-reactive IgE antibodies specific for galactose-a-1,3-galactose33 with the incidence of IRRs.
In conclusion, post hoc analysis of the MABEL
study safety data suggested that the addition of corticosteroid to antihistamine as prophylactic premedication
reduced the incidence of IRRs associated with the administration of cetuximab. Cox modeling did not identify an
impact of type of premedication on treatment efficacy.
However, it should be noted that the possible role of confounding factors in the current post hoc analysis has not
been corrected for nor quantified. A prospective randomized study would be necessary to further strengthen the
evidence base for the assertion that the addition of corticosteroid to antihistamine premedication causally reduces
the incidence of IRRs compared with antihistamine treatment alone. Given that the current guidelines within
Europe19 specify the administration of an antihistamine
and a corticosteroid before the first cetuximab infusion
and recommend the same pretreatment for subsequent
infusions, the implementation of such a study might now
be difficult in a European setting. However, the

1835

Original Article

investigation of whether particular corticosteroids might
be more effective than others in reducing the incidence of
cetuximab-associated IRRs would be feasible.
Although there are some promising early results, no
clear predictive characteristic or group of characteristics
has so far been unequivocally identified that would allow
for the identification of patients who are likely to experience IRRs. Currently, therefore, a pragmatic approach of
prophylactically premedicating patients with both antihistamine and a corticosteroid would appear to be beneficial in relation to reducing the frequency of cetuximabassociated IRRs.
