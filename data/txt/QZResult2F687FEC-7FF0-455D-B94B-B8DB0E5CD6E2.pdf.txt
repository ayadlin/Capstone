ABSTRACT
Palliative care in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is inadequate. For elderly
patients, unfit for intensive chemotherapy, median survival is 2–3 months. As such,
there is urgent demand for low-toxic palliative alternatives. We have repositioned two
commonly administered anti-leukaemia drugs, valproic acid (VPA) and hydroxyurea
(HU), as a combination therapy in AML.
The anti-leukemic effect of VPA and HU was assessed in multiple AML cell lines
confirming the superior anti-leukemic effect of combination therapy. Mechanistic
studies revealed that VPA amplified the ability of HU to slow S-phase progression
and this correlated with significantly increased DNA damage. VPA was also shown
to reduce expression of the DNA repair protein, Rad51. Interestingly, the tumour
suppressor protein p53 was revealed to mitigate cell cycle recovery following
combination induced arrest. The efficacy of combination therapy was validated in vivo.
Combination treatment increased survival in OCI-AML3 and patient-derived xenograft
mouse models of AML. Therapy response was confirmed by optical imaging with
multiplexed near-infrared labelled antibodies.
The combination of HU and VPA indicates significant potential in preclinical
models of AML. Both compounds are widely available and well tolerated. We believe
that repositioning this combination could significantly enhance the palliative care of
patients unsuited to intensive chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

Valproic acid (VPA) is a short chain fatty acid used
clinically as an anticonvulsant for more than 30 years. In
2001 the compound was rediscovered for its anticancer
activity as an HDAC inhibitor, (HDACi) targeting class
1 and 2 HDAC enzymes [4]. A multitude of preclinical
studies have combined VPA with genotoxic and nongenotoxic therapies reporting substantially increased
efficacy [5–8]. More recently it has been illustrated that
this increased efficacy may be accountable to VPA’s
capacity to modulate DNA damage repair proteins.
Specifically VPA has been shown to target homologous
recombination proteins, negatively regulating expression
and localization of Rad51, Chk1, BRCA1 and BRCA2.
[9] In the last decade various clinical trials have exhibited

Palliative care in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
is unsatisfactory. For elderly patients, who do not tolerate
intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation,
median survival is 2–3 months [1, 2]. AML is a genetically
heterogeneous disease and numerous classes of anticancer
agents have been trialled with varying success. Histone
deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have indicated significant
potential, whilst DNA targeting compounds remain a
stalwart of clinical practice [3]. Emerging studies continue
to reveal novel molecular mechanisms underpinning these
agents. Such molecular insights also provide a unique
opportunity to reassess existing therapeutics.

VPA’s capacity to incite clinical response in primary and
secondary AML patients [10–13]. However, the use of
VPA in AML is predicated on its HDACi activity and
consequent induction of differentiation and apoptosis.
Limited clinical emphasis has been placed on its ability to
modulate DNA repair.
Hydroxyurea (HU) is an antimetabolite that
targets cancer cells through stalling and subsequent
collapse of S-phase replication forks [14]. HU inhibits
ribonucelotide reductase thereby depleting the cellular
pool of deoxynucleotides and incurring reversible DNA
damage [15]. S-phase specific genomic assaults then
depend on homologous recombination proteins, including
Rad51, for repair [16]. The clinical importance of HU in
myeloid neoplasms cannot be understated. Hydroxyurea
is routinely administered to achieve leukocytoreduction in
AML, chronic myeloid leukaemia, hyperleukocytosis and
leukostasis [17, 18]. The safety of the compound is further
exemplified by its on-going use and reccomendation for
the treatment of young patients suffering from sickle cell
anaemia [19]. In AML the compound may be prescribed
prior to induction chemotherapy or experimentally in
combination with other moderate or low toxic therapies,
particularly in palliative care [20, 21].
Various preclinical studies have examined the
synergistic effects of combining genotoxic compounds and
HDACi [22–25]. However, the mechanisms described to
account for the observed synergism remain inconclusive
and may differ substantially depending on the models
explored. Based on our preclinical and clinical experience
with VPA we are appreciating its relevance in palliative
care of AML [5, 26, 27]. Furthermore non-systematic
testing of VPA and HU in single patients suggests the
combination is well tolerated in elderly patients [21].
These factors encouraged us to reassess HU and VPA as
a combination in preclinical models of AML. Here we
provide evidence that HU and VPA combine effectively
in AML through cooperative modulation of the cell cycle
and DNA repair proteins. Additionally we identify intact
tumour suppressor protein p53 as a likely predictor of
therapeutic response to the combination. In vivo imaging
and survival analysis in orthotopic mouse models,
including a patient-derived xenograft model, confirmed
that this combination treatment improves survival. The
established tolerance and low toxicity of these compounds
additionally highlights their potential in the palliative care
of elderly AML patients.

Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining. Cells were treated
at a fixed ratio alone or in combination for 72 hours
with increasing doses of HU (25–200 µM) and VPA
(0.25–2  mM) (Figure  1A– 1D). Combination treatment
consistently enhanced cell death induction as compared
to the single agents in all cell lines. However, when
comparing the cell viability at doses (HU 50 µM and
VPA 0.5 mM) best reflecting patient serum concentrations
[10, 21], the p53 null HL-60 cells were identified as the
most resistant cell line (Figures 1A–1D). To examine
whether p53 status can mediate therapy sensitivity
at clinically relevant doses, 3 additional leukemic
cell lines (KG1-A, THP-1 and K562) harbouring p53
mutations were assessed and compared to the cell lines
previously described. All cell lines were exposed to HU
60 µM and VPA 0.6 mM for 72 hours to reflect clinically
achievable concentrations [10]. Cell death in response
to combination therapy was significantly increased in
wild-type p53 cell lines compared to null or mutated p53
cell lines. Comparatively, single agent therapy failed to
distinguish significantly between cell lines with varying
p53 status (Figures 1E–1G). To further investigate the
significance of p53 status in response to HU and VPA
combination therapy, we employed MOLM-13 cells
expressing shRNA targeting p53 gene expression.
Western blotting confirmed reduced expression of the p53
protein in MOLM-13 shp53 cells when compared with
MOLM- 13 wt p53 cells transduced with an untargeted
empty vector (Figure 2A) The two cell lines were treated
with HU (75 µM and 100  µM), VPA (0.75 mM and
1 mM) or the combinations. Cell death was determined
by flow cytometry using Annexin-PI staining following
72 hrs treatment (Figure 2B–2C). At both concentration
ratios, the combination therapy induced significantly
more death in MOLM-13 wt p53 cells when compared
with MOLM- 13 shp53 cells. It is a growing concern
that chemotherapy may select for a minority of p53
mutant clones in AML patients [28]. This may contribute
significantly to the emergence of therapy resistant
relapse disease. To investigate the enduring effect of the
combination therapy, cells were exposed to HU (100 µM),
VPA (1 mM) and the combination for 72 hrs. Cells were
then washed twice and reseeded in drug free medium and
maintained for a further 72 hrs. Viable cells were counted
at 24 hr intervals throughout the course of the experiment
(6 days). This recovery assay was performed in MOLM13 shp53, MOLM-13 wt p53 (Figure 2D–2G), HL-60
(p53null) and OCI-AML3 (p53wild-type) cells (Figures H-K).
In all cell lines untreated control cells displayed typical
growth curves over the 6 day period, whilst VPA exerted
a mild slowing of division rate that was lost with removal
of the treatment. HU exhibited a more profound arrest
in cell division, particularly in cells with wild-type p53
status. However, again all cell lines were able to recover
upon removal of the treatment. Uniquely, the combination
therapy limited recovery to the HL-60 and MOLM-13

wild- type) cells were selected for mechanism of action
studies. Previous studies have determined that the
combination of HU and VPA can cooperatively arrest cell
cycle progression resulting in enhanced cell death [23]. We
assessed the cell cycle status of OCI-AML3 cells following
24 hrs exposure to HU (100 µM) and VPA (1 mM), both
alone and in combination (Figure 3A). HU slowed cell
cycle progression with OCI-AML3 cells accumulating in
S and G2/M phase. VPA´s capacity to induce G1 arrest is
previously described [29], however OCI-AML3 cells were
only mildly arrested following VPA exposure for 24 hrs
(Control 51.7% vs. VPA 53.8%). Combination therapy
resulted in strong S-phase arrest where the presence of
VPA appears to amplify HU’s capacity to slow S-phase to
G2 progression. Figure 3B illustrates that the percentage

of cells located in S-phase at 24 hrs combination therapy
is consistent with the fraction of cells determined to
be necrotic (sub G1) following 72 hrs drug exposure.
It is previously described that HU mitigates HDACi
induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21
protein enabling cooperative initiation of S-phase driven
apoptosis in cancer cells [23]. This trend was observed in
the OCI- AML3 cells (Figure 3C). The capacity of VPA to
induce p21 and simultaneously arrest cells in G1 increases
significantly over time. To assess whether VPA had the
capacity to protect cells from HU driven apoptosis, cells
were pretreated with HU (100 µM) or VPA (1 mM) for
24 hrs prior to addition of the second complementary
compound for a further 48 hrs. Cell viability was assessed
by Annexin-PI flow cytometry. Strikingly, when pretreated

with VPA for 24 hrs cells were significantly more
resistant as compared to HU pretreatment (Figure 3D).
These results suggest that unmitigated entry to S-phase
is necessary for synergistic induction of cell death. The
indication that S-phase arrest is important to establish the
synergistic effect of combination therapy is emphasized
when cell cycle status of OCI-AML3 cells is followed
over 72 hrs of combination treatment (Figure 3D).

synergistically induce cell death in OCI-AML3 cells and
primary AML blasts whilst remaining non-toxic in healthy
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry
assessment of Annexin-PI expression was performed
to determine induction of cell death. Dose response
curves and combination index analysis in OCI- AML3
cells supported the Hoechst 33342 data presented in
Figure 1C (Figure 5A + 5B). Primary AML cells from
10 randomly selected AML patients exhibited a range of
sensitivity to HU (75 µM) and VPA (0.75 mM) alone or in
combination when treated for 24 hrs (Figure 5C, Table 1).
Combining the results from all ten patients demonstrated a
significant reduction in mean viability for the HU and VPA
combination treatment against either compound alone
(Figure 5C). Furthermore, synergism, as calculated by
Bliss Independence, was obtained in 9 of the 10 patients
samples assessed (Figure 5D). The viability of PBMCs
from 4 healthy donors exposed to the HU or VPA alone or
in combination for 72 hrs was determined by Annexin- PI
staining to reveal no significant increase in cell death
(Figure 5E).

HU and VPA in combination target DNA damage
repair proteins mitigating recovery from DNA
double strand breaks
To determine whether S-phase arrest was associated
with anticipated HU driven DNA double strand breaks
(DSBs), we evaluated the expression of various DNA
damage repair proteins following exposure to both
compounds and in combination. Protein expression was
evaluated at 24 or 48 hrs to ensure > 65% of cells were
viable. Immunoblotting revealed a marked increase
in the DNA DSB indicator protein γH2AX following
combination treatment as compared to monotherapies
at both 24 and 48 hrs (Figure 4A). Flow cytometry
verified these results and demonstrated additionally that
the increased γH2AX was due to the phosphorylated
version of the H2AX protein (Figure 4B). Interestingly
the tumour suppressor protein p53 was unresponsive
to HU treatment alone, but as expected expression was
significantly increased upon VPA treatment and this was
sustained in combination therapy. Chk1 was decreased in
VPA monotherapy [9, 30], however expression appeared
unaffected in the combinatory treatment, likely due to the
increased presence of DSBs. Crucially, the homologous
recombination repair protein, Rad51 was reduced in the
presence of VPA, both alone and in combination with
HU. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining revealed
γH2AX foci formation in the nucleus of cells exposed to
HU or combination (Figure 4C). Additional localisation
studies verified the formation of the DNA damage
repair foci by nuclear imaging of the MRN complex
member, Nsb-1, in HU and combination treated cells
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence staining
for Rad51 indicated the protein is reduced and restricted
to the cytoplasm in VPA treated cells (Figure 4D). The
cytoplasmic restriction of Rad51 following VPA treatment
was marked, while Rad51 expression in combination
treated cells was diffuse and unspecific. Together these
results suggest that the capacity of HU to induce DNA
DSBs is vastly enhanced by the presence of VPA, likely
due to aberrant expression and localization of Rad51.

The combination of HU and VPA significantly
inhibits disease progression in human xenograft
models of AML
To evaluate the capacity of combination therapy
in vivo, the compounds were evaluated in both an OCIAML3-derived orthotopic model of AML and a primary
patient-derived AML xenograft (PDX) (Figure 6). In
both models AML cells were engrafted into NOD/
SCID IL2rγnull (NSG) mice. The dosing regime for
monotherapies and combination treatment was identical
in both experiments, though the treatment initiation date
differed to reflect differing disease burdens. Preliminary
toxicity studies indicated the dosing regime to be well
tolerated with minimal adverse effects (Supplementary
Figure 2A). The survival curve of the OCI-AML3
orthotropic model illustrates clearly that single agent
treatments provoked limited disease response preclinically.
Remarkably, a significant increase in survival was
observed in combination treated animals compared
with controls (p = 0.0003), VPA (p = 0.0001) and HU
(p = 0.0014) treated animals (Figure 6A). In a second
in vivo experiment using an aggressive primary AML PDX
model, optical imaging with fluorescently conjugated,
multiplexed monoclonal antibodies targeting human
leukaemia cells was employed [31, 32]. The purpose of
this study was to visualise and quantify the efficacy of the
combination in vivo. To facilitate imaging therapy was
initiated in the stages of advanced disease [31]. In vitro
studies performed on the primary AML cells used to
generate the PDX model confirmed the superiority of the
combination compared with monotherapies (Figure 6B).
Disease progression before (Day 21) and after (Day 28)
treatment was monitored using optical imaging providing

DISCUSSION

a powerful insight into the therapeutic impact of the
treatments employed. Combination therapy significantly
reduced the total fluorescence of pooled animals at day 28
compared to both monotherapies (vs. HU p = 0.0005, vs.
VPA p = 0.0002) and controls (p = < 0.0001), (Figure  5D
and 5E). Combination of HU and VPA at the doses and
schedules employed did not adversely affect the body
weights or condition in either study (data not shown).
Furthermore, despite being treated during advanced stage
disease, mice treated with the combination typically
survived longer compared with monotherapies and control
animals, though this observation was not statistically
significant (Supplementary Figure 3A). These data suggest
that the combination of HU and VPA can impact upon
aggressive AML models of late stage palliative AML
therapy. Finally, Figure 6F provides a schematic overview
of the mechanism described in the article illustrating the
molecular insults attributed to HU and VPA, and how the
wt expression of p53 ultimately determines cell death or
survival in AML cells.

Enhanced efficacy with combination therapy
was observed to varying degrees in four AML cell
lines (MV4– 11, OCI-AML3, MOLM-13, HL-60)
compared with single agent treatment (Figure 1). At
clinically relevant doses the mutational status of the p53
protein significantly influenced combination efficacy
(Figure  1E–1G). The primary AML cells examined
were predominantly p53 wild-type and therefore should
reflect the general AML patient population (Table 1). The
tendency of enhanced combination effect was recapitulated
in these samples (Figure 5) but the relatively limited
efficacy observed in some wild-type p53 patient cells
(I and H) suggests that other factors may also influence
therapy response. When comparing MOLM-13 shp53 and
MOLM-13 wt p53 cells combination efficacy proved to
be significantly more efficient in those cells containing
wt p53. Whilst approximately 90% of AML patients are
deemed p53 wild-type, a recent study suggests that some

of these patients may harbour residual p53 mutant clones
that are infrequent and typically undetected [28]. This
suggests that in the context of chemotherapeutic regimes,
low abundance mutated p53 clones may be selected for
expansion. To examine whether the HU and VPA share
this therapeutic limitation we performed a treatment
recovery assay in MOLM-13 shp53, MOLM-13 wt p53,
HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cells (Figure 2). Importantly, wt
p53 was revealed to be critical for mitigating cell cycle
recovery following combination induced arrest.

It is recognized that HU specifically targets
cells during DNA synthesis by depleting the available
nucleotide pool [14, 33]. Following 24 hrs of combination
treatment cell cycle analysis showed that OCI-AML3
cells were predominantly found in S-phase and therefore
vulnerable from potential genotoxicity incited by HU
(Figure 3A). In addition we assessed p21 expression
during drug exposure. It is reported previously that HU
induced down-regulation of p21 may be required for
combination driven cell death. Our results confirmed

the reduced p21 expression in the presence of HU and
illustrated that VPA substantially slows passage through
S-phase in combination treated cells. By altering the
sequence of drug exposure (delaying addition of HU by
24 hours) cells were prevented from entry to S-phase and
protected from apoptosis. Together these observations
highlighted the importance of the cooperative cell cycle
arrest previously attributed to these compounds [23].
They also suggest that when operating synergistically, the
compounds depended predominantly on HU driven DNA
damage to provoke cell death.
The effects of VPA on leukemic cells are diverse
and pleiotropic [34]. The capacity to influence various
cellular processes whilst maintaining low toxicity may
partly explain its amenity to combination strategies.
Previous studies have implicated HDAC inhibitors in the
dysregulation of homologous recombination repair (HRR)
[35, 36]. Our study confirms this property is operative in
VPA treated AML cells. In combination treatment, where
cells had incurred substantial DNA DSBs, Rad51 staining
appeared reduced, diffuse and absent of the characteristic
nuclear foci. Rad51 nuclear foci are associated with
the proteins functional role in the repair of DSBs and
their presence is considered a valid estimation of HRR
capacity [37, 38]. Interestingly, increased expression of
Rad51 has been suggested as a mechanism of chemoresistance in FLT3 mutated AML [37]. HU induced DSBs
increase corresponding to dose and drug incubation time
[39]. At low concentrations or reduced exposure times,
cellular capacity to recover from stalled replication
forks is sufficient to avoid incitement of DSBs. This is
conveyed by the absence of γH2AX expression flowing

48 hrs (Figure 4A–4B). However, the dramatic increase
of combination-induced γH2AX compared to control
and mono-treatments exemplifies the capacity for VPA to
enhance the potency of HU.
In vivo efficacy of the drug combination was
assessed in two aggressive mouse models of AML
(Figure 6) [31, 32]. These studies provided key preclinical
indication that repurposing of these compounds as a lowtoxic combination therapy may have clinical value in
AML. Our second model assessed combination therapy
in a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model of AML.
Multiplexing of fluorescently conjugated monoclonal
antibodies enabled precise imaging of disease progression
before and after therapy. We observed no adverse effects
in either model upon treatment with the combination of
VPA and HU (Supplementary Figure 2A). Treatment of
the PDX animals occurred during advanced disease to
facilitate imaging thus potentially inhibiting therapeutic
efficacy in regards to survival (Supplementary Figure 3A).
Nevertheless, in vivo imaging provided a clear indication
that both the leukemic burden and dissemination of
AML blasts was significantly reduced in mice receiving
combination therapy when compared to control and monotherapy groups.
We observed difference in efficiency of HU and
VPA in cell line models and a varying effect in the
primary AML cells tested in vitro, underscoring the future
possibility to identify responders or non-responders
of HU and VPA based on molecular and biological
characteristics of the AML disease. Several case reports
[21] together with our animal models have suggested
the compounds are unlikely to result in toxicity when
administered in combination, indicating the feasibility

HU and VPA as a combination therapy could significantly

enhance the palliative care of patients unsuited to intensive
chemotherapy, particularly if non-responders can be
predicted prior to initiation of treatment

MATERIALS AND METHODS

0.5% BSA, was performed in the dark for 1 hour at room
temperature. Finally, the coverslip was washed three times
with 1XPBS, dipped once in water and mounted in 5 μl
Fluoro-gel II with DAPI (Electron Microscopy Sciences, PA,
USA). Images of were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Observer
Z1 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH,
Germany) and analyzed by the AxioVision 4.8.2 software.

Cell lines, primary AML cells and healthy
PBMCs
Seven leukemic cell lines were included in the
study, OCI-AML3 (DSMZ), MV4–11, HL-60, KG1-A,
THP-1, K562 and MOLM-13 (ATCC). p53 knocked
down MOLM-13 cells and empty vector (MOLM-13
shp53) were generated by retroviral transfection for stable
expression of shRNA against p53 using the pRETRO
SUPER-p53 vector [5]. The concentration of puromycin
was steadily increased to 400 µg/ml over a two-week
period. Primary AML cells were acquired from patients
at Haukeland University Hospital following informed
consent. Approval was obtained from the regional Ethics
Committee (REK Vest; http://helseforskning.etikkom.
no; Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research).
Normal peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from
healthy blood donors (Blood bank, Haukeland University
Hospital, Bergen, Norway).

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS overnight.
For DNA content analysis cells were pelleted and
resuspended in PBS containing 1 mg/ml RNase (Sigma
Aldrich) and 10 mg/ml PI, incubated at room temperature
for 30 min, then analysed using the Accuri C6 flow
cytometer (BD Sciences).

H2AX and γH2AX expression assay
The assessment of H2AX expression in OCI-AML3
cells was performed using the H2AX Muse™ H2A.X
Activation Dual Detection Kit (Millipore). 1 × 105 cells
were analyzed from each sample condition following
48 hrs drug exposure. Samples were prepared in strict
accordance to the manufacturer’s procedure and run on
the Muse® Cell Analyzer flow cytometer.

Cell death assays
Evaluation of cell death and apoptosis in cell lines
and primary AML cells after drug treatment was performed
using Hoechst 33342 staining of nuclear morphology and
AnnexinV-propidium idodide (Annexin- 
PI) detection
of apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis. Assays were
performed as previously described [5].

Monoclonal antibody conjugation
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) CD45 (clone F10–
89–4), CD33 (clone WM53), HLA ABC (clone W6/32; all
AbD Serotec) were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 using
the SAIVI Alexa Fluor 680 Labelling Kit (Invitrogen)
as described [32]. Protein concentrations of the Alexa
Fluor 680–conjugated mAbs degree of labelling were
determined using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fischer Scientific).

Western blotting
Western Blotting was performed as previously
described [5]. The following antibodies were used; Actin
(sc- 4778) Chk1 (DCS-310) p53 (Bp53–12), Rad51 (sc-8349)
(all from Santa Cruz Biotech), p21 (EA10, Abcam,), γH2AX
(DR1017) and H2AX (DR1016) (both from CalBiochem,
Germany). Goat-POD- anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used
as appropriate for primary antibody detection.

Optical imaging
Prior to imaging, mice were depilated and
anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane (Isoba; ScheringPlough), 0.2 L/min of O2, and 0.2 L/min of N2. NIR images
were obtained with the eXplore Optix or Optix MX3 Small
Animal Molecular Imager system (ART Inc). NIR imaging
scans (λex = 670 nm, λem = 700 LP, laser repetition rate
80 MHz, raster scan points 1 mm apart) were obtained
24 hours after administration of Alexa Fluor 680–labelled
mAbs (total mAb concentration of 1 µg/g). Optiview
software (Versions 1.04 and 2.02; ART Inc) was use to
analyse images and perform fluorescence lifetime gating.

Immunofluorescence
Following treatment incubations cells were cytospun
onto coverslips followed by fixation and permeabilization
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and ice-cold 99%
methanol for at least 20 min at -20 degrees or stored,
respectively. Cells were then blocked with 0.5 % Bovine
Serum Albumin (BSA) (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)
in 1XPBS for 15 min before incubation with primary
antibody, rabbit Rad51 (1:200, sc-8349), γH2AX (DR1017,
CalBiochem, Germany) or Nsb-1 (D6J5I, Cell Signalling
Technology) diluted in 1XPBS with 0.5% BSA at 4°C over
night. After three washes in 1XPBS, cells were incubated
with secondary antibody (1:5,000 of Alexa 568 goat antirabbit (Invitrogen Molecular Probes)) diluted in 1XPBS with

Chou-Talalay method [40] or by Bliss Independence analysis
[41]. In both in vitro and in vivo studies statistical significance
between the averages of varying treatment groups were
determined using a two-tailed Student t test. In vivo survival
data was evaluated using the Kaplan and Meier analysis
method. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed to ensure no statistical significant difference in
weights between the animals in the treatment groups.
