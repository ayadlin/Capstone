Abstract
We here describe a novel xenograft model of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) generated by infusion of human
primary CLL cells into immunodeficient nonobese/severe
combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Combined
i.v. and i.p. injection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) from 39 patients with CLL resulted in highly
reproducible splenic (37 of 39) and peritoneal (35 of 39)
engraftment, which remained stable over a time span of 4 to
8 weeks. By comparison, recovery of leukemic cells from bone
marrow (21 of 39) or peripheral blood (8 of 22) was
substantially lower. The engraftment pattern of CLL PBMC 4
weeks posttransplant was correlated with clinical disease
activity: infusion of PBMC from donors with Binet stage A,
lymphocyte doubling time of >12 months, and normal lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels led to marked engraftment
of T cells whereas comparably few tumor cells could be
detected. In contrast, NOD/SCID mice receiving PBMC from
donors with advanced stage Binet C, lymphocyte doubling
time of <12 months, and elevated LDH serum levels exhibited
predominant engraftment of tumor cells and comparably low
numbers of T cells. These results suggest that this model
reflects the heterogeneity and important clinical characteristics of the disease, and thus may serve as a tool for preclinical drug testing and investigation of the pathophysiology
of CLL. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8653–61]

Introduction
In the past 10 years, several xenograft models of human chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using immunocompromised severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice have been reported (1–4).
Work in this field has generally been hampered by inefficient
engraftment (1) and EBV transformation of human cells (2).
Recently, some of these pitfalls were successfully addressed by
Shimoni et al. (3), who transplanted CLL peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) into the peritoneal cavity of lethally

irradiated mice radioprotected with bone marrow from SCID mice.
Importantly, in their initial description of this model, the authors
found that PBMC from donors with Rai stage 0 disease led to
marked engraftment of human T cells but comparably few
leukemic B cells. In contrast, chimeric mice receiving PBMC from
patients with advanced CLL (Rai stage III and IV) exhibited a
reverse engraftment pattern with a predominance of tumor cells
over accessory T cells (3). In a follow-up study, the same authors
elegantly showed that autologous T cells can control CLL cell
engraftment and suggested that their model could provide a useful
tool for the investigation of the pathogenesis and disease
progression in CLL (4). However, limitations of this approach have
also been noted in that engraftment of CLL cells was followed
only over a comparably short period of 2 weeks and the site of
engraftment was restricted to the peritoneal cavity.
Following up on the above described studies, we aimed at
developing a novel xenograft model for human CLL by transplanting
primary CLL PBMC into nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice and
analyzing the engraftment potential of these cells in various murine
tissues over a time period of up to 12 weeks. Furthermore, the
engraftment capacity of CLL cells was correlated with the disease
stage and the molecular risk factor profile of the individual donors.

Materials and Methods
Patients and isolation of CLL cells. For establishment and evaluation
of the model, peripheral blood samples from 39 CLL patients treated at the
University Hospital Essen between December 2004 and December 2006 were
used ( for details, see Table 1). In all patients, the morphologic diagnosis of
CLL was confirmed by flow cytometry revealing a typical CD19+CD5+CD23+
immunoglobulin light chain (n or E light chain)–restricted immunophenotype. Expression of ZAP-70 and CD38 was determined by flow cytometry as
recently described (5). Patient selection was based on a WBC count
exceeding 20/nL and a treatment-free interval of z6 months before sample
acquisition. Heparanized whole-blood cell samples (peripheral blood,
20–50 mL) were obtained during routine follow-up visits to our institutions.
Informed consent was obtained according to institutional guidelines.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated within 3 h of
venipuncture by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia) density centrifugation. The
interlayer was collected, washed twice, counted on a hemocytometer, and
resuspended in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Life
Technologies, Inc.) at the desired cell concentration and transplanted
within 2 h. In five experiments, PBMC before transplantation were depleted
of CD3+ human T cells using the MidiMACS isolation system (Miltenyi
Biotech). Purity of CD19+ cells after T-cell depletion was >99.5% as analyzed
by flow cytometry. T cell–depleted grafts were compared with T cell–
enriched grafts, in which 0.5  107 to 1.9  107 T cells (equivalent to 5–18%
of total cells and double the amount of T cells present in the original PBMC
sample) were added to the grafts before transplantation.

Transplantation of NOD/SCID mice. NOD/SCID mice of both genders
were bred and handled under sterile condition and animals were transplanted at ages 8 to 15 weeks. PBMC were transplanted into NOD/SCID
mice at 30 to 60 min after sublethal irradiation (3.0–3.25 Gy) of the animals
using i.v. and/or i.p. application. A total of 1.0  108 PBMC suspended in
0.2 mL of IMDM were injected per chosen route.
Collection of cells from NOD/SCID mice. Peripheral blood was
obtained every 2 weeks from the tail veins of transplanted animals. For
harvest of cells from the peritoneal cavity, bone marrow, and spleen, mice
were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 4, 8, or 12 weeks after transplantation
or earlier when they became listless or unwell. Peritoneal cells were
obtained by peritoneal lavage with 5 mL of 0.9% NaCl whereas bone marrow

cells were obtained by flushing the femoral, tibial, and hip bones with
IMDM and afterward filtering cells through 70-Am nylon sieves (Becton
Dickinson). For analysis of engraftment within the murine spleen, one half
of the organ was fixed immediately in buffered 3.7% formalin and afterward
embedded in paraffin for further histologic and immunohistochemical
analyses. The other half was mechanically homogenized, pressed through
70-Am nylon sieves (BD Falcon), and suspended in PBS for further analysis
by flow cytometry.
Characterization of human cell engraftment in NOD/SCID mice
using flow cytometry. For detection of cell-surface antigens, single-cell
suspensions obtained from the different organs were incubated for 30 min
on ice with a mixture of the indicated appropriate fluorescently labeled

A Novel Animal Model for CLL
monoclonal antibodies. In some experiments, cell-surface antigens were
first stained and fixed, followed by permeabilization of the plasma
membrane (Cytofix/Cytoperm, Becton Dickinson) and staining of intracellular antigens. After washing, four-color flow cytometric analysis of human
antigens was done on a Coulter Epics XL analyzer (Coulter Electronics).
Erythrocyte lysis (Pharmlyse, Becton Dickinson) of the cells was done before
staining. The following directly labeled antibodies were used for the
characterization of human cells: CD45-cyanine dye (Cy5), CD19-phycoerythrin, CD5-FITC and CD23-energy coupled dye, E light chain (FITC,
Kallestad), n light chain (FITC, Kallestad), CD38 phycoerythrin (Becton
Dickinson), CD100 (FITC, Serotec), and survivin (FITC, R&D Systems) for
CLL cells; CD45-Cy5, CD4-phycoerythrin, CD8-FITC, and CD3-energy
coupled dye for human T cells. Antibodies were purchased from Beckman
Coulter Immunotech except indicated otherwise. For the determination of
ZAP-70, we used an indirect staining approach as previously described (5)
using anti-ZAP-70 (clone 2F3.2, Upstate Biotechnology) as a primary
antibody and goat-anti-mouse immunoglobulin-FITC (DAKO) as secondary
antibody. Phycoerythrin-, phycoerythrin-cyanin 5.1–, energy coupled dye–,
and FITC-conjugated mouse isotypic monoclonal antibodies served as
controls and were included in all experiments.
Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation experiments. Analysis of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation was done using the FITC BrdUrd
Flow kit (PharMingen) after a single i.p. injection of BrdUrd (PharMingen;
1 mg/6 g of mouse weight within 5 days after transplantation) and admixture
of 1 mg/mL BrdUrd (Sigma) to drinking water for 5 days within week 1 and
week 3 each, after transplantation (6). Analysis for BrdUrd incorporation in
recovered CLL cells was only done when splenic engraftment >1% CLL cells
of total spleen cells was evident.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. To detect specific
anomalies of the leukemic clone in chromosomal regions 11q, 13q, and
17p in cells recovered after transplantations, the following fluorescencelabeled DNA probes were used for interphase cytogenetic analyses:
locus-specific identifier (LSI) ATM (11q23), LSI D13S319 (13q14), LSI p53
(17p13.1), and chromosome enumeration probe (CEP) 12 (centromere 12).
All probes were purchased from Abbot Vysis. Sample preparation,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and counterstaining with
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride were done as previously
reported (5).
Histologic staining of spleen sections. Four-micrometer-thick sections
of paraffin-embedded spleen sections were obtained and stained with H&E
according to standard procedures. Additional serial sections were prepared
for immunohistochemical investigation. Immunohistochemistry was done
using the EnVision+ System peroxidase method (DAKO) with monoclonal
mouse antibodies (immunoglobulin G) against human leukocyte common
antigen (CD45, clones 2B11+PD7/26, DakoCytomation; dilution, 1:1,000),
CD3 (clone F7.2.38, DakoCytomation; dilution, 1:100), CD20 (clone L26,
DakoCytomation; dilution, 1:4,000), CD21 (clone 1F8), and Ki67 (clone
BGX-297, ready to use, BioGenex).
For double immunohistochemistry, the same CD3 and CD20 antibodies
and an additional Ki67 antibody were used (Ki67, clone SP6, DCS; dilution,
1:1,200). Antigen retrieval was carried out at 98jC for 10 min in a water bath
(Target retrieval buffer, DAKO). The CD3/Ki67 and CD20/Ki67 double
labelings were done in two steps. First, Ki67 labeling with an immunohistochemical staining technique based on a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
labeled polymer that is conjugated to secondary antibodies (ZytoChemPlus
HRP Polymer Kit, Zytomed Systems) was done. Staining was completed by
an incubation with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine + substrate-chromogen (Zytomed
Systems), which results in a brown-colored precipitate at the antigen site.
Second, CD3 or CD20 labeling was done with an alkaline phosphatase–
labeled polymer [ZytoChemPlus (AP) Polymer Kit, Zytomed Systems] and
developed with a Permanent Red chromogenic substrate system (Zytomed
Systems). At the end of the procedure, nuclei were counterstained with
hematoxylin for 5 min.
In situ hybridization. For the detection of a latent EBV infection by
in situ hybridization, sections from paraffin-embedded tissue were analyzed.
In brief, slides were dewaxed, rehydraded, and dried at 45jC. Afterward,
they were pretreated with proteinase K for 25 min at 37jC. Two drops of

www.aacrjournals.org

EBV-specific FITC-labeled oligonucleotide probe [DAKO, Epstein-Barr Virus
(EBER) PNA Probe/Fluorescein] were added to the tissue section and slides
were covered with coverslips. The hybridization was carried out for 90 min
at 55jC. After washing with diethyl pyrocarbonate water, oligonucleotide
binding was indirectly detected with an anti-FITC antibody conjugated to
alkaline phosphatase (DAKO, PNA ISH detection kit).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean F SE unless
otherwise specified. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 13.0 for
Windows (SPSS, Inc.). The significance of differences between groups was
determined with the Friedman test (differences between the application
routes and differences in CLL or T-cell engraftment within the different
tissue compartments), the Kruskal-Wallis test (differences in engraftment
according to stage), the Wilcoxon test (differences between the mean
fluorescence intensities of survivin and CD100 expression of transplanted
and engrafted CLL cells and differences in CLL or T-cell engraftment
within the same compartment), or the Mann-Whitney U test [differences
in engraftment according to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte
doubling time, or prognostic parameters], with P V 0.05 considered to be
significant.

Results
Establishment of a NOD/SCID Xenotransplant Model
of Human CLL
All in all, the transplantation of 43 primary human peripheral
blood-derived CLL samples from 39 different CLL patients was
investigated in a total of 167 NOD/SCID mice. The clinical
characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.
In initial experiments using 5 different CLL samples and 35
NOD/SCID mice, the most suitable route for transplantation was
determined by transplanting 1  108 CLL cells from the same
sample either i.p. (n = 12 mice), i.v. (n = 12 mice), or via both routes
(i.p. + i.v.; n = 11 mice). Figure 1A shows representative flow
cytometry plots of CLL cells before transplantation and of human
cells recovered from the bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneal
cavity of a NOD/SCID animal showing that the recovered cells from
all three compartments exhibited the CD19+CD5+CD23+ immunophenotype characteristic of CLL cells. On quantitative analysis, the
number of recovered CLL cells was significantly higher in the
spleen and peritoneal cavity as compared with the bone marrow
(Fig. 1B). Whereas CLL recovery in the murine spleen was higher
following i.v. versus i.p. transplantation, cell recovery in the
peritoneal cavity was mainly dependent on the i.p. route.
Combination of both routes, however, yielded the best results
(Fig. 1B).
We then proceeded to validate this model in a cohort of 39 CLL
patients (Table 1). For these experiments, only the combined
i.v. + i.p. injection route was used and a total of 126 mice were
evaluated. In line with our previous results, analysis at week 4
revealed consistent engraftment of human CD45+ cells in 37 of 39
(94.9%) experiments. The highest number of CD45+ cells was
detected in the murine spleens whereas cell recovery from bone
marrow and peritoneal cavity was significantly lower (Fig. 1C;
P = 0.00000001). Human T cells engrafted more efficiently than
their leukemic counterparts, accounting for the majority of CD45+
cells in the murine spleen and bone marrow (Fig. 1C). Of note, a
reverse engraftment pattern was noted in the murine peritoneal
cavity, where the number of CLL cells recovered after 4 weeks
exceeded that of the accessory T cells (P = 0.038; Fig. 1C). In the
peripheral blood, comparably low numbers of CLL cells were
detected in 12 of 18 and 8 of 22 samples 2 and 4 weeks after
transplantation, accounting for 1.1 F 0.5% and 0.7 F 0.3% of the
total peripheral blood leukocytes at these time points. Again,

Figure 1. Human B-CLL cells recovered from bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneal cavity of NOD/SCID mice. A, representative flow cytometry plots of cells
transplanted (Donor CLL ) and cells recovered from bone marrow (BM ), spleen, and peritoneal cavity (PC ) of animals 4 wks after transplantation exhibit the CLL-typical
CD19+CD5+CD23+CD45+ surface phenotype. B, quantitative recovery of human B-CLL cells 4 wks after transplantation of 1  108 PBMC i.p., i.v., or via both routes
(i.p. + i.p.) in bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneal cavity of NOD/SCID mice. C, quantitative recovery of human CD45+, B-CLL, or CD3+ human T cells 4 wks
after transplantation of 1  108 PBMC i.p. and i.v., respectively, in bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneal cavity of NOD/SCID mice. Evaluation of the model with a
total of 39 different CLL samples using the i.p. + i.v. combination. Significantly higher engraftment for all three subpopulations could be shown for the spleen when
compared with bone marrow or peritoneal cavity. Columns, mean; bars, SEM. SSC, side scatter.

higher engraftment rate and absolute number of human T cells
were detected in the peripheral blood of the transplanted animals
2 weeks (17 of 17) and 4 weeks (14 of 22) after transplantation,
accounting for 10.2 F 4.0% and 6.6 F 3.5% of the total peripheral
blood leukocytes, respectively.
Taken together, these results suggest that murine splenic tissue
offers a more supportive microenvironment for the engraftment of
CLL PBMC than peritoneal cavity, bone marrow, and peripheral
blood.
Individual reproducibility. To evaluate the reproducibility of
our model in four individual patients showing high, moderate, low,
or no splenic CLL cell recovery, transplantation was repeated at
a later time point. Comparative analysis of human CLL cells
recovered from the spleens in these four paired experiments
showed reproducible recovery of CLL cells for individual patients,
and 29.9  105 versus 19.6  105, 15.8  105 versus 15.4  105, and
2.2  105 versus 11.2  105 recovered cells, and no engraftment
versus no engraftment were observed. To unequivocally confirm
that the recovered CD45+CD19+CD5+CD23+ cells originated from
the transplanted leukemic cell clones, we carried out comparative
FISH and immunoglobulin light chain restriction analyses in a
series of four cases with informative cytogenetic aberrations.
Reassuringly, concordant results with both assays were observed in
all of the four cases (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Time course of CLL cell engraftment. In a total of five
experiments, the recovery of human CLL cells in the spleen as well
as the peritoneal cavity of NOD/SCID mice was evaluated over a
more extended time period. Whereas absolute numbers of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

recovered CLL cells remained relatively stable between weeks 4
and 8 (spleen, 5.5 F 3.2  105 versus 2.4 F 1.4  105; peritoneal
cavity, 0.6 F 0.3  105 versus 3.2 F 2.9  105); at week 12, a
substantial decline of cells was noted in the spleen (0.6 F 0.3  105)
as well as the peritoneal cavity (0.2 F 0.1  105).

Histologic Analysis of Splenic Engraftment
In view of the fact that the highest absolute number of human
cells was consistently observed in the murine spleens, we further
investigated the histomorphologic appearance of these cells using
H&E as well as immunohistologic staining of spleen sections. All
in all, 46 mice transplanted with 15 different CLL samples were
analyzed (Supplementary Table S1). Strikingly, a focal infiltration
pattern of human lymphoid CD45+ cells situated along the splenic
arterioles was observed in the majority of animals (37 of 46;
representing 14 of 15 CLL samples; Fig. 2A). On immunohistochemistry, the majority of cells in these focal aggregates exhibited a
CD20+ CLL phenotype (88.3 F 3.6%; Fig. 2B), whereas a smaller
proportion represented accessory CD3+ T cells (11.0 F 3.4%;
Fig. 2C). In some cases, these focal aggregates consisted almost
exclusively (>99%) of CD20+ CLL cells (Supplementary Table S1).
The majority of the H&E-stained lymphoid CD20+ cells morphologically exhibited typical features of prolymphocytes: cells were
larger than a normal lymphocyte and their nuclei contained finely
distributed chromatin as well as small nucleoli (Fig. 2D, arrows).
Besides this population, a fraction of paraimmunoblasts characterized by a nucleus containing a solid centrally located nucleolus
was observed (Fig. 2D, cones). When the potential presence of

A minority of animals (9 of 46; 6 of 15 CLL samples;

of human cells consisting mostly of CD3+ T cells (72.5 F 8.4%) and
less frequently of CD20+ CLL cells (27.5 F 8.4%). Of note,

histomorphologic analysis of spleen sections 12 weeks after
transplantation frequently revealed a considerable amount of
fibrosis with a consecutive loss of structural integrity of the murine
splenic tissue, which was not detectable 4 weeks after transplantation. To rule out EBV-transformed lymphoma cells as the source
of the recovered human cells in several experiments, additional
in situ hybridization analysis for EBV-encoded RNAs was done

CLL Cells Recovered from Murine Spleens Exhibit a
Distinct Phenotype and Show Proliferative Activity
To further characterize the human CLL cells recovered from the
NOD/SCID spleens, a panel of surface and intracellular marker
molecules was used. Given the histologic similarities between the
focal aggregates observed in our NOD/SCID model and the
pseudofollicular proliferation centers described in human CLL
(7), this analysis focused on marker molecules described as
characteristic of CLL cells located in proliferation centers, survivin,
and CD100 (8–10). In 23 mice presenting with focal aggregates in
the spleen, consistently a substantial percentage of human CD45+
cells (19.5 F 2.7%) stained positive for Ki67. Analysis of focal
aggregates composed almost exclusively (>99%) of CD20+ CLL with
only sporadic interspersed T cells indirectly confirmed that Ki67
was indeed expressed in CLL cells (data not shown). In addition,
Ki67 expression in CLL cells and absence of Ki67 expression in
human T cells could be shown directly by double immunostaining
of Ki67 and CD20 as well as CD3 (Fig. 3A–C). Here, hardly any Ki67

staining was detected in human CD3+ T cells (Fig. 3B), but
coexpression of Ki67 and CD20 was evident in a substantial
fraction of CLL cells recovered from the murine spleens (Fig. 3C).
Of note, high-power magnification of splenic focal CLL aggregates
revealed that the Ki67+ cells exhibited morphologic features of
either paraimmunoblasts or prolymphocytes (Fig. 3D).
Activation of CLL cells within proliferation centers has also been
shown to result in increased expression of survivin, one of the
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, as well as up-regulation of the
semaphorin protein family member CD100 (semaphorin 4D;
refs. 8–10). As depicted in Supplementary Fig. S2, the same pattern
of activation was observed in our CLL model. Of note, significant
up-regulation of survivin (P = 0.028; Supplementary Fig. S2B) as
well as CD100 (P = 0.043; Supplementary Fig. S2D) was detected in
leukemic cells recovered from NOD/SCID spleens when compared
with the initially transplanted CLL cells.
To further investigate the proliferative potential of human CLL
cells recovered from NOD/SCID spleens, 5-bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) incorporation during a 1- to 3-week in vivo exposure
period was analyzed in five samples showing typical focal
aggregates in the corresponding histomorphologic analyses. In

differences did not reach statistical
significance (P > 0.05).

these experiments, 6.7% to 25.0% of the recovered splenic CLL cells
stained positive for BrdUrd (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that
a significant proportion of splenic CLL cells located within splenic
aggregates had entered the cell cycle during the BrdUrd exposure
period.

Correlation of Splenic CLL PBMC Engraftment with
Clinical and Molecular Disease Parameters
We then proceeded to correlate splenic CLL PBMC engraftment
with the disease characteristics observed in individual patients
at the time of transplantation (Fig. 4). Here, we found that
parameters reflecting disease activity (e.g., Binet stage, lymphocyte
doubling time, and LDH serum activity) exhibited a significant
positive correlation with CLL cell engraftment (Fig. 4A). Disease
stage also affected the histologic appearance of the transplanted
cells in the murine spleens in that samples from Binet stage C
patients exclusively engrafted in a follicular pattern. By contrast,
all of the nine cases with a diffuse infiltration pattern were
observed in samples obtained from Binet stage A and B patients
(Supplementary Table S1). In line with these findings, samples
obtained from poor-prognosis patients, as defined by expression
of CD38 (8, 11–13), ZAP-70 (5, 14–17), unmutated IgVH genes
(11, 18, 19), or high-risk cytogenetics (20), generally showed a
higher leukemic cell engraftment than CLL cells isolated from
patients with good prognosis (Fig. 4B). However, the observed
differences failed to reach statistical significance, suggesting
that the model may better reflect disease activity at the time
of venipuncture rather than the long-term clinical course of
individual cases.

Effects of Accessory T Cells on Splenic CLL Cell
Recovery
Interestingly, increased leukemic B-cell engraftment in advanced
disease stages inversely correlated with the number of recovered
accessory T cells (Fig. 5), suggesting that the biological properties
of CLL T cells may change in the course of the disease. To further
define the role of accessory human T cells in this model,
comparative transplantation experiments using T cell–depleted and
T cell–enriched grafts were done. In line with the results shown in
Fig. 5, we found that T cells isolated from patients with advanced/
active disease seemed to increase leukemic cell recovery as compared
with T cells obtained from patients with early/inactive disease
(Supplementary Table S2). However, these potentially interesting
findings are limited by the small number of patients analyzed and
thus need to be confirmed in a larger series. Furthermore, these
experiments did not reveal a consistent effect of cotransplanted
T cells on either histomorphologic appearance ( focal aggregate
formation) or survivin and CD100 expression by the leukemic cells
(data not shown).

Discussion
We here describe a novel and robust in vivo model of human
CLL using NOD/SCID mice as recipients of primary peripheral
blood-derived CLL cells. In this model, we show reproducible and
stable recovery of PBMC from CLL patients over a time span of
8 weeks after transplantation. Comparing different routes of
transplantation, the highest number of human CD45+ cells was
detected in the murine spleen followed by the peritoneal cavity,
bone marrow, and peripheral blood, suggesting that splenic tissue
may offer the most suitable microenvironment for the transplanted
cells.

Figure 5. CLL cells derived from advanced-stage donors have a higher capacity
to engraft in NOD/SCID spleens. A, cellular composition of inoculated PBMC
as analyzed by flow cytometry. No significant differences in the content of CLL
cells and accessory T cells were noted in PBMC samples derived from patients
with different Binet stages. B, the ratio of engrafted human CLL and accessory
T cells depends on the disease stage.

Given that the highest number of engrafted human cells was
observed in the murine spleen, we aimed to further investigate the
morphologic and functional characteristics of these cells in this
tissue compartment. Histomorphologic evaluation of spleen
sections revealed focal aggregates of CD45+ human cells consisting
of both CLL and accessory T cells, which were clustered around
splenic arterioles. At higher magnification, these focal aggregates
were found to contain a mixture of paraimmunoblasts, prolymphocytes, and interspersed small lymphocytes. Further immunohistochemical evaluation showed that the prolymphocytic and
paraimmunoblastic cells exhibit a CD20+CD23+CD5+ phenotype
and that a substantial proportion of these cells stain positive for
the proliferation marker Ki67. The proliferative potential of these
cells was confirmed by BrdUrd DNA incorporation experiments,
which unequivocally showed that a substantial proportion of the
transplanted CLL cells entered the cell cycle during the 4-week
posttransplant period. Consistent with their proliferative potential
and their ‘‘activated morphology,’’ these cells were found to express
the B-cell activation markers survivin and CD100, as detected by
multiparameter flow cytometry. Both of these molecules have
previously been shown to exert prosurvival effects in CLL cells
and may play an important functional role in the molecular

pathogenesis of the disease (8–10). Whereas, to our knowledge,
this is the first detailed report on the occurrence of splenic focal
aggregates following the transplantation of CLL cells into mice, this
is probably not a unique characteristic of CLL cells as previous
work by Burakova et al. (21) has shown that transplanted normal
human PBMC form follicles in the spleen and lymph nodes of SCID
mice.
Clearly, the most important finding of this study is that the
engraftment capacity of leukemic cells closely correlated with the
disease characteristics observed in individual patients at the time
of transplantation. In line with data published by the Reisner group
(3, 4), we found that transplantation of PBMC obtained from
patients in stage Binet A resulted in marked i.p. engraftment of
human T cells, whereas only few leukemic cells were recovered
from the peritoneal cavity of the recipient animals. Conversely,
infusion of samples from donors with Binet C disease led to the
predominant engraftment of tumor cells compared with a low
number of accessory T cells. Importantly, using the combined
i.v./i.p. transplantation route, which has previously not been used
in this experimental setting, we observed a similar disease stage–
dependent engraftment profile in the murine spleen and peritoneal
cavity. However, absolute human cell recovery was higher in the
murine spleen as compared with peritoneal cavity, raising the
possibility that using splenic CLL cell engraftment as readout may
be advantageous due to a potentially higher sensitivity of the assay
system. Of note, disease stage and cellular composition of the
human graft also affected the histologic appearance of the
transplanted cells in the murine spleens in that samples from
Binet stage C patients exclusively engrafted in a follicular pattern
(Supplementary Table S 1). By contrast, all of the nine cases with
a diffuse infiltration pattern were observed in samples obtained
from Binet stage A and B patients. Furthermore, we found that
parameters reflecting disease activity other than Binet stage
[ref. 22; e.g., lymphocyte doubling time (23–25) and LDH serum
activity] also exhibited a significant positive correlation with CLL
cell engraftment. Similarly, when samples were grouped according
to the expression/presence of the molecular risk factors (19) CD38
(13), ZAP-70 (5, 26), IgVH mutation status (11, 18), and karyotype
(20), the prognostically unfavorable group generally showed a
higher leukemic cell engraftment than CLL cells isolated from
patients with good prognosis. However, the observed differences
failed to reach statistical significance, suggesting that the model
may better reflect disease activity at the time of venipuncture
rather than the long-term clinical course of individual cases.

Taken together, leukemic cells from advanced-stage patients
have a higher engraftment potential than early-stage CLL cells,
whereas T cells derived from patients with advanced disease
engraft less efficiently than their counterparts obtained from Binet
stage A patients. This mutually exclusive pattern of engraftment
first described by Shimoni et al. (4) raises the possibility that T cells
may at least partly control the expansion of the tumor cell clone
in vivo. Our data are compatible with the concept that T cells
isolated from early-stage patients may be capable of suppressing
tumor cell growth (27, 28) whereas T cells from Binet stage C may
have lost their antineoplastic immunosurveillance function (29, 30).
In support of this hypothesis, we found that addition of autologous
T cells purified from Binet stage A patients reduces splenic
leukemic cell engraftment whereas addition of T cells from patients
with progressive/advanced disease increases leukemic cell recovery
from murine spleens. In this context, it is worth noticing that
T cells of CLL patients with indolent disease have been shown to
exhibit a lower production of leukemic cell survival–promoting
cytokines as compared with T cells from patient with advanced
disease (31, 32).
In conclusion, our data show that PBMC from CLL patients can
be effectively engrafted into NOD/SCID mice. Using combined
i.v./i.p. transplantation, the highest number of engrafted cells is
detected in the murine spleen, where these cells can be
conveniently quantified and subjected to further functional
analysis. Our finding that CLL cells obtained from advanced-stage
patients with elevated LDH serum activity and short lymphocyte
doubling time exhibit a higher engraftment potential as compared
with samples derived from donors with indolent disease suggests
that our model reflects the heterogeneity and important clinical
features of the disease. Thus, we suggest to further evaluate this
model as a tool for preclinical drug testing and the investigation of
the pathophysiology of CLL.
