Abstract
Direct DNA damage is often considered the primary cause of cancer in patients exposed to ionizing radiation or
environmental carcinogens. Although mitochondria are known to play an important role in radiation-induced
cellular response, the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic stimuli modulate mitochondrial dynamics and
functions are largely unknown. In the present study, we examined changes in mitochondrial dynamics and
functions triggered by a particle damage to the mitochondria in human small airway epithelial cells, using a
precision microbeam irradiator with a beam width of 1 mm. Targeted cytoplasmic irradiation using this device
resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation and a reduction of cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase
activity, when compared with nonirradiated controls, suggesting a reduction in respiratory chain function. In
addition, mitochondrial fragmentation or ﬁssion was associated with increased expression of the dynamin-like
protein DRP1, which promotes mitochondrial ﬁssion. DRP1 inhibition by the drug mdivi-1 prevented radiationinduced mitochondrial ﬁssion, but respiratory chain function in mitochondria inhibited by radiation persisted for
12 hours. Irradiated cells also showed an increase in mitochondria-derived superoxide that could be quenched by
dimethyl sulfoxide. Taken together, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the extranuclear,
nontargeted effects of ionizing radiation. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6700–10. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Radiation-induced nuclear DNA damages, such as singleand double-stranded breaks, if left unrepaired, have been
regarded as the main cause of mutations and cancer. However,
there is recent evidence that extranuclear targets may also be
important in mediating the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation (1, 2). There is evidence that targeted cytoplasmic
irradiation with a particles induces mutation in mammalian
cells through a process involving reactive radical species, while
inﬂicting minimal cytotoxicity (3). Furthermore, cells/tissues
that are not directly irradiated but are in the vicinity of hit cells
or receiving signals from such cells through a process involving
COX-2 and participate in the damage process (bystander/
nontargeted response) have been demonstrated under both
in vitro (4) and in vivo conditions (5, 6). Through membrane
lipid peroxidation-mediated signaling pathway involving 4hydroxynonenal and COX-2 (1), there is evidence of a common

link in mitochondrial integrity and mitochondria-mediated
signaling events that tie the two process together (4).
Mitochondria are important dynamic organelles within
the cytoplasm that display continuous movement, fusion,
and ﬁssion to form the mitochondrial reticulum (7). Defects
in mitochondrial dynamics and function may cause severe
diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson, Huntington, and
Optic atrophy (8–11). Mitochondrial fusion and ﬁssion are
controlled by a large GTPase family of dynamin mechanochemical proteins. For mitochondrial ﬁssion, DRP1 is
recruited from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial outer
membrane (12). In particular, DRP1 also regulates the membrane severing events for mitochondria and peroxisomes
(13). The mitochondrial fusion mediators are mitofusin 1
(MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1)
proteins (14). Previous studies have demonstrated that
whole-cell irradiation with high-ﬂuence, low-power laser
causes an imbalance in mitochondrial ﬁssion–fusion in
human lung adenocarcinoma cells (ASTC-a-1) and SV40transformed African green monkey kidney ﬁbroblasts (COS7; ref. 15). Moreover, X-irradiation induces mitochondrial
DNA damage including changes in copy number and supercoiling in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line (16).
These results show that mitochondrial biogenesis plays an
important part in radiation-induced cellular response.
Because whole-cell irradiation includes nuclear traversal,
which can modulate mitochondrial signaling process, the
ability of mitochondria to initiate damage response process
is largely unknown. This is due mainly to the difﬁculties in
selectively targeting the cytosol without affecting the nucleus. Thus, studies on the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic

Cytoplasmic Irradiation and Mitochondrial Damage

stimuli modulate mitochondrial dynamics and functions are
important to determine the genotoxic effects induced by
radiation.
Our study is designed to unequivocally ascertain the consequence of cytoplasmic stimuli on mitochondrial dynamics
and functions by selectively irradiating only the mitochondrial
cluster without affecting the nucleus. Our results show that
cytoplasmic irradiation induced mitochondrial fragmentation
with a concomitant increase in the expression of DRP1 and the
ﬁssion process could be inhibited by mdivi-1, an inhibitor of
DRP1, indicating that DRP1 mediates cytoplasmic irradiation
induced mitochondrial ﬁssion. Moreover, cytoplasmic irradiation results in reduced respiratory chain function and
increased mitochondrial superoxide production. The changes
in mitochondrial dynamics and functions as a result of a
particle radiation are temporal and reversible after 24 hours
and therefore seem to be an acute stress response. Because
mitochondria play a vital role in cellular homeostasis, it is not
surprising that they are the primary target of the stress
response without concomitant nuclear damage. Our study
represents a ﬁrst attempt to investigate how mitochondria
respond to acute stress without concomitant nuclear damage.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)
immortalized human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells were
previously generated (17). Cells were labeled with GFP-glycoprotein linked to their mitochondrial membrane and maintained in serum-free Small Airway Epithelial Cell Growth
Medium supplemented with various growth factors supplied
by the manufacturer (Lonza). Wild-type and DRP1 knockout
HCT116 cell line were obtained from the National Institute
of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, NIH (Bethesda, MD)
through one of the co-authors (C. Wang), cells were maintained
in McCoy 5A's medium (Gibco/Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with glutamine (2 mmol/L) and nonessential amino
acid (1). Cultured cells were maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator.
Microbeam irradiation
Approximately, 500 to 600 cells were placed on microbeam
dishes coated with Cel-Tak (BD Biosciences) to enhance cell
attachment. The microbeam image analysis system was used to
locate the positions of all the nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342
on the dish, after which a deﬁned number of 5.1 MeV 4He ions
was delivered at two target positions, 8 mm away from each end
of the cell nucleus along the major axis of the nucleus as
described previously (1, 3). Particle ﬂuence was measured by
a detector positioned above the cells. Before irradiation, the
culture medium was removed immediately from the microbeam
dishes and a moisture cover was placed over the objective lens
to keep the cells from drying out during the 15- to 20-minute
procedure. After every cell on the plate had been irradiated,
fresh medium was replaced and the dishes were left in the incubator at 37 C for deﬁned time periods. Irradiated dishes were
studied at different time points (0, 0.5, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hours).
All control cells were stained and sham-irradiated as well.

Quantiﬁcation of mitochondrial fusion and ﬁssion genes
by real-time PCR
Cells were rinsed in cold PBS in the microbeam dishes in
preparation for cell lysis after cytoplasmic irradiation. The mRNA
was extracted using the TaqMan Gene Expression Cells-to-Ct
Kit (P/N 4399002). The primers for DRP1 (Hs01126016_m1),
MFN1 (Hs00966851_m1), MFN2 (Hs00208382_m1), and OPA1
(Hs00323399_m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The
probe for b-actin (Hs99999903_m1) was chosen as endogenous
control. Gene expression was measured by Applied Biosystems
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System in standard mode, and data
were analyzed by RQ manager software.
Mitochondrial morphology assessment
Cells were grown on polypropylene dishes and ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde at different time points after cytoplasmic
irradiation. After ﬁxation, cells were rinsed in PBS in the
microbeam dishes and images were captured on a Nikon
confocal microscope (Nikon TE200-C1) under ambient temperature. Images were taken by the EZ-C1 software. Measurements of mitochondrial size and shape were quantiﬁed by
ImageJ (NIH) software. A 10-mm standard scale was used to
calibrate the pixels from the ImageJ software and the mitochondrial dimension was converted from the pixel image to
actual sizes using the standard. Mitochondria that were longer
than 0.5 mm were deﬁned as tubular mitochondria. To assure
accuracy in the scoring process, mitochondrial size and shape
were determined and analyzed independently by two investigators. More than 200 clearly identiﬁable mitochondria from
50 cells per experiment, randomly selected, were measured in
three independent experiments.
Treatment with mitochondrial ﬁssion inhibitor
SAE cells were treated with mitochondrial division inhibitor,
mdivi-1 (50 mmol/L) for 2 hours before irradiation with 10a
particle targeted through the cytoplasm. The mdivi-1 used in
the present study was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (M0-1995MG). Purity as provided by the manufacturer is more than 98%
[high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)]. The inhibitor was removed just before irradiation and fresh medium
containing the mdivi-1 was replenished after irradiation. Irradiated cells were incubated with the inhibitor for a maximum
period of 4 hours and the cultures were rinsed and replenished
with fresh medium before returning to the incubator.
Immunocytochemistry
The DRP1 protein was detected by immunocytochemistry.
After cytoplasmic irradiation, SAE cells were rinsed with PBS,
ﬁxed for 15 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. The ﬁxed cells
were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes and
washed three times with PBS. The cells were immunolabeled
with 1:100 dilution of DRP1 antibody (Abcam; ab56788) in 2%
bovine serum albumin for 1 hour; counterstained with goat
anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200) and the immunocomplex was visualized using the Avidin Biotin Complex (ABC)
method. The samples were examined with the Nikon LABOPHOT-2 microscope and images were captured by the SPOT

Basic software. The DRP1 relative staining intensity was measured by ImageJ (NIH) software.
Cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase
histochemistry
Irradiated samples plated on microbeam dishes were airdried, then preincubated with 1 mmol/L CoCl2 and 50 mL of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in 50 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.6,
containing 10% sucrose, for 15 minutes at room temperature.
The cells were rinsed in PBS and incubated for 6 hours at 37 C
with 10 mL of substrate solution (10 mg of cytochrome c, 10 mg
of diaminobenzidine, 2 mg of catalase, and 25 mL of DMSO in 10
mL of 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.6). The microbeam
dishes were rinsed in PBS, mounted with cover glass in
glycerin-gelatin. For succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining,
microbeam dishes were incubated with the buffer containing
0.55 mmol/L nitro-blue tetrazolium and 0.05 mol/L sodium
succinate for 3 hours at 37 C. The microbeam dishes were
washed three times with PBS and mounted with cover glass in
glycerin-gelatin. The samples were examined with a Nikon
LABOPHOT-2 microscope and images were captured by the
SPOT Basic software. Histochemical staining was quantiﬁed by
ImageJ (NIH) software. Camera light settings were standardized to the absorbance boundary of 0 to 225 (from white to
black). The color images were captured with a 40 objective.
The same threshold settings were used for all the samples.
Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t test and
P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
ROS measurement
Intracellular superoxide radicals were estimated using the
MitoSOX Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (Invitrogen
Corp.). Cells were treated with 0.5% (v/v) DMSO (Sigma) before
and after cytoplasmic irradiation for 30 minutes, respectively.
Cells were loaded with MitoSOX at 5 mmol/L concentration
and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C after a particle exposure
and rinsed three times with PBS before ﬂuorescence measurements. Cellular ﬂuorescence intensity was detected using a
Nikon TE200-C1 confocal microscope under ambient temperature. The ImageJ software was used to quantify the reactive
oxygen species (ROS) ﬂuorescent intensity of each of 100
randomly selected cells (1). Results represent the pooled data
from three independent experiments. Data were scored and
analyzed independently by two investigators to assure accuracy in the scoring process.
Statistics analysis
Data were presented as mean  SD. Statistical analyses
were performed using Student t test. P < 0.05 was considered to
be statistically signiﬁcant between nonirradiated control and
cytoplasmic irradiation group.

brane and mitochondria were visualized by ﬂuorescence confocal microscopy. We used the mitochondria-speciﬁc stain
MitoTracker Red to reafﬁrm the mitochondrial localization of
the GFP-glycoprotein (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Mitochondria exhibit an elongated and tubular morphology
in control cells (Fig. 1A and C). Cells that are under physiologic
stress such as those exposed to 10a particles through the
mitochondrial cluster in the cytoplasm show fragmented and
shortened mitochondria as early as 0.5 hours after irradiation
(Fig. 1A). Accordingly, the percentage of cells with tubular
mitochondria declined from 46% to 21% at 0.5 hours after
cytoplasmic irradiation and recovered gradually to 80% of
control level by 24 hours (Fig. 1B). Similar mitochondrial
morphologic changes were also observed after irradiation with
a single a particle targeted at each end of the nucleus 8 mm
away (i.e., 2 a particle per cell). However, the extent of the
changes was not as profound as 10a particle used in the
present studies (data not shown).
Further live cell image analyses showed a tubular mitochondrial morphology in control, nonirradiated SAE cells (Fig. 1C).
In contrast, mitochondria underwent ﬁssion in irradiated cells
and resulted in shortened mitochondria at 3 minutes postirradiation. The same mitochondrion was found to be further
fragmented into three sections at 25 minutes postirradiation
(Fig. 1C). The mean mitochondrial length in cytoplasmicirradiated cells decreased from 0.4 to approximately 0.25 mm
in irradiated cells. The decrease in mitochondrial length
remained constant for the 25 minutes time period examined
(Fig. 1D).
Cytoplasmic irradiation leads to mitochondrial
dysfunction
To determine whether cytoplasmic irradiation affects mitochondrial respiratory chain function, cytochrome c oxidase
and SDH activities were determined by enzyme histochemistry
after irradiation with 10a particles. Compared with untreated
cells, cytoplasmic irradiation resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction
in cytochrome c oxidase activity as early as 0.5 hours postirradiation (P < 0.01; Fig. 2A and B). The reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity was still evident at 4 hours postirradiation before beginning to recover to a level that was 70%
of control by 24 hours. Interestingly, the activity of SDH,
encoded entirely by the nuclear genome, was also reduced
after cytoplasmic irradiation and with a similar kinetics as
that of cytochrome c oxidase. The histochemical data were
quantiﬁed by image analysis software and the relative enzyme
activities in cytoplasmic-irradiated cells were reduced to 50%
of controls at 0.5 hours and gradually recovered up to 70% of
control levels by 24 hours (Fig. 2B).
Cytoplasmic irradiation results in ROS generation
To conﬁrm the contribution of ROS induced by cytoplasmic
irradiation to mitochondrial damage, superoxide production
in live cells were measured using MitoSOX Red that can
penetrate live cells and selectively target mitochondria. As
shown in Fig. 3A, SAE cells exposed to 10a particles through
the cytoplasm resulted in an increase in ﬂuorescence intensity
at 2 hours postirradiation at a level that was three times that of

faded to almost background level. To further conﬁrm that
the oxidant level of the radical species was induced by cytoplasmic irradiation, cells were pretreated with the radical
scavenger DMSO (0.5%) for 30 minutes before irradiation. As
shown in Fig. 3C, quenching prevented the induction of
superoxide production as illustrated by the absence of ﬂuorescence signal in the irradiated cells at 4 hours posttreatment
(Fig. 3D; P < 0.05). Finally, to check the speciﬁcity of the
MitoSOX assay in detecting superoxide production, SAE cells
were pretreated with the superoxide dismutase mimetic, Mn
(III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride
(MnTMPyP; Cayman Chemical) at a dose of 20 mmol/L for

The mRNA expression levels for the ﬁssion gene DRP1, the
fusion genes MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 in cytoplasmic-irradiated
cells were measured using quantitative real-time PCR over a
period of 12 hours postirradiation. DRP1 was dramatically
increased 6-fold in cytoplasmic-irradiated cells at 0.5 hours
compared with control cells, and the increase persisted 2-fold
from 2 to 12 hours, as shown in Fig. 4A. In contrast, MFN1,

at 12 hours after exposure when compared with nonirradiated
cells (Fig. 4B–D). In general, increased expression of ﬁssion
genes and decreased expression of fusion genes were found,
indicating abnormal mitochondrial dynamics after cytoplasmic irradiation.
Suppression of DRP1 by mdivi-1 inhibits cytoplasmic
irradiation-induced mitochondrial fragmentation
DRP1 is imported from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) when it initiates ﬁssion of mitochondria. To correlate the increased mRNA with protein expression,
immunocytochemistry was used to quantify DRP1 protein
expression in cytoplasmic-irradiated cells. Representative
DRP1 staining images were shown in Fig. 5A where irradiated
cells demonstrated a higher DRP1 protein level at 0.5 hours
posttreatment when compared with controls. The semiquantiﬁcation data showed that DRP1 was increased approximately
2-fold compared with control at 0.5 and 2 hours postirradiation
and gradually decreased close to control levels by 24 hours (Fig.
5B). This increase in DRP1 protein was consistent with the
observed morphologic changes.
The mdivi-1 is a selective inhibitor of DRP1 in mammalian
cells, which inhibits DRP1 assembly from cytoplasm to the
OMM during ﬁssion (19). To check whether DRP1 is indeed
involved in mitochondrial fragmentation during cytoplasmic
irradiation, cells were pretreated with 50 mmol/L mdivi-1 for 2
hours before irradiation, removed during irradiation (15
minutes), and continued treatment for 4 hours after irradia-

tion. The maximum mdivi-1 treatment time was 6 hours and
resulted in no toxicity to SAE cells based on the MTT assay
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Treatment with mdivi-1 prevented
the increase in DRP1 protein observed in cells exposed to
cytoplasmic irradiation (Fig. 5C and D). In addition, these
cells retained their ﬁlamentous mitochondria after radiation,
similar to the morphology found in control cells at 0.5 hours
postirradiation (Fig. 5C and D). As shown in Fig. 5D, treatment
with 50 mmol/L mdivi-1 reduced DRP1 expression by 60% after
cytoplasmic irradiation. Furthermore, in the presence of mdivi1, the percentage of tubular mitochondria in irradiated cells
was maintained at a level comparable with nonirradiated
control (Fig. 5E). These data clearly illustrate that cytoplasmic
irradiation induced DRP1 expression to promote mitochondrial fragmentation and the process can be suppressed by
mdivi-1. Because chemical inhibitor may have off-target
effects, the results obtained with mdivi-1 were further conﬁrmed using a DRP1 knockout cell line, human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116KO, and its wild-type counterpart,
HCT 116-WT (data not shown) and similar results were
obtained (data not shown).
Cytoplasmic irradiation induces mitochondrial
dysfunction despite suppression of DRP1 by mdivi-1
To determine whether blocking mitochondrial fragmentation induced by cytoplasmic irradiation would affect mitochondrial respiratory chain function, cells were ﬁrst pretreated
with 50 mmol/L mdivi-1 for 2 hours, irradiated without mdivi-1,
and continued treatment for 4 hours after irradiation. The

cytochrome c oxidase and SDH activities were determined by
histochemical staining. Representative images are shown in
Fig. 6A. The mdivi-1–pretreated cells continued to show signiﬁcantly reduced cytochrome c oxidase and SDH staining
at 0.5 hours, but no obvious change was observed at 24 hours
after cytoplasmic irradiation when compared with control
cells. Quantiﬁed data are shown in Fig. 6B in which both cytochrome c oxidase and SDH enzymes were reduced by 50% up
to 4 hours postcytoplasmic irradiation. A signiﬁcant reduction
of cytochrome c oxidase and SDH enzyme activities in irradiated cells was still evident at 12 hours posttreatment before
returning to control values by 24 hours (Fig. 6B). These results
suggest that mdivi-1 pretreatment, while able to prevent
mitochondrial fragmentation, fails to reverse the consequent
mitochondrial dysfunction in cytoplasmic-irradiated cells.

Discussion
Radiation is a well-established human carcinogen. Based
principally on the cancer incidence found in survivors of the
atomic bombs in Japan, the International Commission on
Radiation Protection (ICRP) and the U.S. National Council
on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) have
recommended that estimates of cancer risk for low-dose
exposure be extrapolated from higher doses where data are
available using a linear, no-threshold model (20). This recommendation is based on the dogma that the DNA of the
nucleus is the main target for radiation-induced genotoxicity, and as fewer cells are directly damaged at lower doses,
the deleterious effects of radiation decline proportionally.

However, evidence obtained in the past few years from our
laboratory and others has indicated that extra nuclear
targets/extra cellular events may also play an important
role in determining the biologic responses of ionizing radiation, particularly, at low doses (3, 21–23). A major paradigm
shift in radiation biology in the last decade has resulted from
the elucidation of the biologic consequence of targeted
cytoplasmic irradiation and the discovery of the bystander
effect. Until recently, the biologic consequences of cytoplasmic damage are largely unknown. This is due mainly
to the technical difﬁculties in selectively targeting the cytoplasm without affecting the nucleus.
Using a charged particle microbeam, there is unequivocal
evidence that targeted cytoplasmic irradiation induces
mutation in the nuclei of the same hit cells in a process
involving reactive radical species. Furthermore, targeted
cytoplasmic irradiation induces minimal toxicity in mammalian (3) and SAE cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
mechanism involved in the generation of these oxyradicals,
however, remains unknown. Mitochondrial ROS is generated
by electron leakage from electron transport chain complexes
during normal respiration (24–26). Excessive ROS production by mitochondria especially the superoxide will lead to
oxidative damage to the redox-signaling pathway and affect
a series of activities in the mitochondria, cytosol, and
nucleus (27). Targeted cytoplasmic irradiation induces
mutations and the oxidative DNA damage marker, 8-OHdG
in mammalian cells, which can be signiﬁcantly reduced in
the presence of the radical scavenger, DMSO (1, 3). Furthermore, in targeted cytoplasmic-irradiated cells, there is an

increase in 3-nitrotyrosine, a nitrosated protein product
often used as a marker of peroxynitrite anions. In the
presence of the methylarginine, L-NMMA, the nitrotyrosine
level was signiﬁcantly reduced (1). These results, together
with the MitoSOX assay, suggest that the origin of the
reactive radical species is likely to be membrane-mediated
superoxide anions. Our study found a signiﬁcant reduction
of complex II (SDH) and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase)
activities after cytoplasmic irradiation, which was followed
by an increase in ROS production. Ungvari and colleagues
also reported that partial knockdown of cytochrome c
oxidase in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells
signiﬁcantly increased mitochondrial ROS production (28).
Reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity may result in low
ATP production and also decreased electron transfer from
complex II to complex III, thus enhancing the respiratory
chain dysfunction. Moreover, low activity of SDH may also
result in increased superoxide levels. There is also evidence
that mitochondrial complex II is another site of ROS generation and deﬁciencies of SDH not only cause decreased
ATP production, but also promote production of ROS (29,
30). Thus, cytoplasmic irradiation induced excessive ROS
production is likely related to the declined activities of
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and SDH.
Cellular quality control is maintained by mitochondrial
dynamics including fusion, ﬁssion, as well as the movement
of mitochondria. Our present studies reveal that targeted
cytoplasmic irradiation results in mitochondrial ﬁssion, with
corresponding mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in
SAE cells. We observed abnormal mitochondrial morphology
within 4 hours after cytoplasmic irradiation, which gradually
recovered by 24 hours, suggesting that cytoplasmic irradiation
induced changes in mitochondrial dynamics in SAE cells.
There is evidence that cells purposefully segregate its mito-

chondria by undergoing mitochondrial ﬁssion to eliminate
dysfunctional ones (31). To maintain the dynamic equilibrium,
fusion events seem to predominately form more interconnected tubular mitochondria within 24 hours postirradiation,
permitting mixing of mitochondrial contents. This may perhaps result in intramitochondrial complementation of dysfunctional mitochondria and reversal of the damage due to
irradiation (32). Therefore, a balance between ﬁssion and
fusion events may be an adaptive stress response necessary
for normal cellular function. Interestingly, Kobashigawa and
colleagues also showed accelerated mitochondrial ﬁssion in
normal human ﬁbroblast-like cells exposed to g irradiation
(33). In the present study, enzyme histochemistry studies
showed a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase and SDH activity
in the early 4 hours period after cytoplasmic irradiation and
gradually recovered up to 70% of control levels by 24 hours.
These results reveal potential connection between mitochondrial dynamics and functions. There is evidence that excessive
mitochondrial ﬁssion resulted in reduced respiratory chain
functions in Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease (34–36).
Mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by different processes, such as ﬁssion and fusion, and mitochondrial remodeling in
mammalian cells (37). DRP1 plays a key role in ﬁssion, whereas
MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 are required for fusion (38, 39).
Because of the limited number of cells that could be plated
and individually irradiated on microbeam dishes, the DRP1
protein analyses were carried out using semiquantitative
immunostaining method in this study. Our results showed
that both the DRP1 gene and protein were increased at 0.5
hours posttreatment when compared with controls, which
correlated with an increase in mitochondrial ﬁssion. Our
observation is consistent with the recent report that DRP1 is
increased in brain tissues of Alzheimer's patients and is
accompanied by mitochondrial ﬁssion compared with control

the steady state where fusion–ﬁssion occurs even under normal conditions. There is evidence that in apoptotic cells, DRP1
turnover is blocked and levels are stable after mitochondrial
fragmentation, where DRP1 is irreversibly bound to the mitochondrial membrane (41). Our present studies not only

observed an increased level of DRP1 gene, but also found
decreased fusion genes including MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 for
at least 12 hours after cytoplasmic irradiation, a ﬁnding that is
similar to previous reports that enhanced ﬁssion and impaired
fusion contribute to the mitochondrial ﬁssion process
(37, 42, 43).

The mdivi-1 is a new pharmacologic inhibitor that selectively inhibits mitochondrial division dynamin DRP1 (19).
To avoid any toxic effect of prolonged mitochondrial disequilibrium, the maximum mdivi-1 treatment time in our
study was 6 hours. We show that temporary blocking of
ﬁssion by mdivi-1 prevents mitochondrial fragmentation
without averting the suppression in respiratory chain function in the immediate postﬁssion period. This dichotomy
was further conﬁrmed using a DRP1 knockout (KO) cell
line. Selective mitochondrial fusion events serve to complement and rescue compromised mitochondrial function
in fragmented mitochondria. If this does not occur, then the
fragmented, damaged mitochondria may be eliminated by
mitophagy. In our study, mdivi-1 prevented mitochondrial
ﬁssion induced by cytoplasmic irradiation, and also blocked
the ability to eliminate damaged mitochondria within 4
hours postirradiation, thus resulting in reduced respiratory
chain function. Our ﬁnding is consistent with other reports
that mitochondrial dynamics contribute to the regulation of
mitochondrial functions and quality control (44–46), and
that the balance of morphologic dynamics in mitochondria
is important and necessary to maintain cellular integrity after damage by cytoplasmic irradiation. The delay
in return to normal mitochondrial function after cytoplasmic irradiation in our study may be due to a shift in
this balance.

Time postirradiation (h)

In summary, our studies reveal that targeted cytoplasmic irradiation results in mitochondrial ﬁssion, with corresponding mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in
SAE cells. The impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain
function is correlated with increase in ROS levels. This acute
mitochondrial response caused by cytoplasmic irradiation
may result in the release of several stress mediators, which
are necessary for mitochondria to preserve cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, mitochondrial ﬁssion was associated
with increased expression of the DRP1 gene. However,
inhibition of DRP1 expression by mdivi-1 prevented radiation-induced mitochondrial ﬁssion, but not the reduced
mitochondrial respiratory chain function. Our results clearly
indicate that a balance between mitochondrial fusion and
ﬁssion is essential to maintain normal mitochondrial function. Preliminary data suggest that selective autophagy of
fragmented dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy) may
serve as a quality control mechanism to restore normal
mitochondrial function. However, this aspect needs to be
further elucidated.
