Abstract
Ginkgolic acid (GA) is a botanical drug extracted from the seed coat of Ginkgo
biloba L. with a wide range of bioactive properties, including anti-tumor effect.
However, whether GA has antitumor effect on pancreatic cancer cells and the
underlying mechanisms have yet to be investigated. In this study, we show that GA
suppressed the viability of cancer cells but has little toxicity on normal cells, e.g,
HUVEC cells. Furthermore, treatment of GA resulted in impaired colony formation,
migration, and invasion ability and increased apoptosis of cancer cells. In addition, GA
inhibited the de novo lipogenesis of cancer cells through inducing activation of AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and downregulated the expression of key
enzymes (e.g. acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACC], fatty acid synthase [FASN]) involved in
lipogenesis. Moreover, the in vivo experiment showed that GA reduced the expression
of the key enzymes involved in lipogenesis and restrained the tumor growth. Taken
together, our results suggest that GA may serve as a new candidate against tumor
growth of pancreatic cancer partially through targeting pathway driving lipogenesis.

Introduction

for advanced pancreatic cancer patients [2]. Due to the
serious adverse reaction and the disappointed remedial
and survival benefits of these chemotherapies, identifying
additional novel and effective agents to manage this
dreadful disease is of urgent need.
There is growing evidence that metabolic
reprogramming plays an important role in cancer
development and progression [3]. Elevated fatty acid
synthesis is one of the most important alterations of
cancer cell metabolism. Previous studies have found
that many cancer cells show high rates of de novo lipid
synthesis, including pancreatic cancer [4], hepatocellular
carcinoma [5], breast cancer [6], and prostate cancer [7].
Accumulation of lipid droplets is a frequently observed

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related death in the United States with an overall
5-year survival rate less than 6% [1]. In the past, although
substantial progress has been made in our understanding
of the biology of pancreatic cancer, there is no obvious
improvement on survival of this malignancy. Currently,
surgical resection offers the only chance to cure pancreatic
cancer at early stage. Unfortunately, the vast majority
of newfound cases present with advanced unresectable
disease at the time of diagnosis, losing the opportunity for
radical surgery. Gemcitabine and FOLFIRINOX are the
two recommended frontline chemotherapeutic regimens

phenotype in cancer and is a manifestation of abnormal
lipid metabolism [8]. A recent study reveals that lipid
droplet, as a dynamic organelle, can not only provide
energy through β-oxidation for the tumor cells when
required, but also play an important role in signaling
transduction related with carcinogenesis and cancer cell
survival [9]. Inhibition of key enzymes and genes involved
in lipogenesis could obviously slow down the growth of
tumor cells and impairs their survival [10]. Therefore, to
find agents targeting lipogenesis may serve as a promising
strategy to treat cancer.
Ginkgo biloba L. is an ancient gymnosperm
species which is now distributed worldwide, especially
in China. Ginkgolic acids (GA), also known as anacardic
acids, are mixtures of a series of GA homologues and
are the main biologically active ingredients abundantly
presented in the leaves and the seed coat of Ginkgo
biloba L. For many years, a wide range of bioactive
properties of GA have been revealed, including anti-HIV
[11], anti-bacterium [12], and molluscicidal activities
[13]. Recently, the putative anticancer activity of GA is
of increasing interest. It has been reported that GA has

a potential inhibitory effect on human larynx cancer and
tongue squamous carcinoma cells and has no cytotoxic
effects on non-tumorigenic cells [14]. However, whether
GA has antitumor effect on pancreatic cancer cells and
the underlying mechanisms remains unknown. In this
study, we investigate the effects of GA on the biological
behaviors of pancreatic cancer cells and the underlying
potential molecular mechanisms

Results
GA inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells
Firstly, we examined the effects of GA on the
viability of cancer cell. Pancreatic cancer cell Panc-1,
BxPC-3 and hepatocellular carcinoma cell HepG2 were
treated with increasing doses of GA (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20,
50, and 100μM). Two normal cell lines, HL-7702 (hepatic
immortal cell line) and HUVEC (human umbilical vein
endothelial cell line) were used as control. At indicated

Figure 1: GA treatment suppresses the viability of cancer cells with no cytotoxic effect on non-cancer cells. Cancer cells
(Panc-1, BxPC-3 and HepG2) and two normal cells (HL-7702 and HUVEC) were treated with various concentrations (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50,
and 100μM) of GA. At the indicated time points (12, 24, 36, and 48h), cell viability in each group was assessed by MTT assay.

time points (12h, 24h, 36h, and 48h), the cell viability
was assessed by MTT assay. As shown in Figure 1, GA
decreased the growth of cancer cell lines in a dose- and
time- dependent manner; however, limited inhibitory
effect on HL-7702 and HUVEC was observed even
when we added the GA concentration to 200μM. These
results indicated that GA can inhibit the growth of cancer
cells with little effect on the normal cells under the
concentration of less than 100μM.

no clone forming under the GA concentration of 50μM.
To estimate the percentage of apoptotic cell death
induced by GA, the flow cytometric analyses were
conducted after Panc-1, BxPC-3, and HepG2 cells treated
with or without GA (20μM) for 48h. As shown in Figure
2B, treatment of cancer cells with GA caused an increase
in apoptotic population as compared to the untreated
control cells.
These results demonstrated that GA has a potent
effect to against clone formation and induce apoptosis of
cancer cells.

Next, we detected the effect of GA on clone

markedly decreased the number of colonies compared to
the untreated control cells; moreover, there were almost

acid synthesis or lipogenesis involves modulation of
multiple lipogenic genes at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Therefore, we wanted to determine
whether GA-induced reduction of lipid drops in cancer
cells is mediated by regulating expression of key lipogenic
genes, e.g., acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid
synthase (FASN), sterol regulatory element binding
transcription protein (SREBP)-1, and SREBP-2. To test
this, we measured the expression of lipogenic genes by
qRT-PCR (Figure 4B). GA treatment of Panc-1, BxPC-3,
and HepG2 resulted in a dramatically decrease in ACC,
FASN, SREBP-1 (SREBF-1) expression at mRNA levels.
Among them, the reduction change on FASN expression is
the most obvious. However, we did not see notable change
on SREBP-2 (SREBF-2) expression at transcriptional
level after GA treatment for 24h. And these observations
were confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting
(Figure 4C). Using immunofluorescence, we further
confirmed that the expression of FASN in three cancer
cell lines was markedly suppressed by GA intervention
(Supplementary Figure 1). Together, these data indicated
that GA prevents lipogenesis of cancer cells via inhibiting
lipogenic genes ACC, FASN, and SREBP-1.

BxPC-3, and HepG2, wound-scratch assay was performed
under serum-free conditions. As shown in Figure 3A,
the migration ability of cancer cells was impaired by
GA (20μM) intervention compared to the untreated
control cells. Additionally, a Matrigel invasion assay was
conducted to investigate the effect of GA on the invasion
ability of cancer cells. Consistently, a significantly
decreased invasion was observed in Panc-1, BxPC-3, and
HepG2 cells treated with GA at a concentration of 20μM
as compared with untreated control cells in each group
(Figure 3B). These findings suggest that GA inhibits the
migration and invasion capacities of cancer cells in vitro.

GA prevents lipogenesis of cancer cells
Increased lipogenesis has been proposed to play
a key role in cancer cell survival and progression [15].
To determine whether GA has an influence on lipid
metabolism of cancer cells, Panc-1, BxPC-3, and HepG2
cells were treated with GA (20μM) for 48h, then Oil red
O staining was performed. As shown in Figure 4A, the
content of lipid drops in cancer cells was substantially
reduced after GA intervention. The regulation on fatty

Knockdown of AMPK rescues GA-induced
suppression of lipogenesis of cancer cells

these siRNAs was detected by immunoblotting (Figure
5B). We then chose si-AMPK#1 for further experiments
for its excellent effect to knockdown AMPK expression.
We found that knocking down AMPK expression alone
didn’t affect the expression of FASN, SREBP-1, and
ACC in Panc-1, BxPC-3 and HepG2 cells (Figure 5C);
however, GA prevented these proteins expression was
restored by AMPK knockdown (Figure 5C). Together,
these data suggested that AMPK signaling is involved in
GA suppressed lipogenesis in cancer cells.

Previous studies have established the AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) as an upstream regulator of
genes involved in lipid metabolism [16]. The activation
of AMPK leads to the suppression of lipogenesis. Based
on the above promising findings, we speculated that the
effect of GA on cancer cell lipogenesis may mediated
by AMPK signaling. To test this hypothesis, we further
examined the effect of GA on the activity of AMPK
signaling. Immunoblotting results revealed that the
phosphorylation level of AMPK (P-AMPK) in cancer cells
was significantly increased in response to GA treatment
(Figure 5A). To verify GA-inhibited lipogenesis in cancer
cells is mediated by AMPK signaling, siRNA technology
was developed to knockdown AMPK expression. Three
siRNA sequences were designed and the efficiency of

GA suppresses the tumor growth in vivo
Based on the above in vitro findings, we next
conducted in vivo experiment to confirm the effect of GA
on cancer cells. 100μL BxPC-3 and PSCs mixed singlecell suspension (cell proportion 5:1, containing 1×106
cancer cells) was injected to the right limb subcutaneous

of BALb/c nude mice. After one week, mice were
randomly divided into two cohorts, one of which received
vehicle and the other administrated with GA as described
in the Materials and Methods. The tumor volume was
monitored, as shown in Figure 6A, the tumor growth in
GA group was dramatically retarded as compared with
it in Control group. At the end of the experiment, the
average tumor volume and tumor weight of the group
treated with GA was significantly lower compared with
that of the Control group (Figure 6B and 6C). Consist with
in vitro studies, the immunohistochemistry results showed
that the proliferation of cancer cells was inhibited by GA
administration as there was less and weak expression for
PCNA in GA group compared with that in Control group
(Figure 6D). Moreover, the tumor tissues from mice in GA
group exhibited low level of FASN staining compared with
that from mice in Control group (Figure 6D). And this was
confirmed by immunoblotting (Supplementary Figure 2).
FASN expression in the GA-treated group was obviously
decreased compared to the Control group. In addition, the
phosphorylation level of AMPK (P-AMPK) in the GAtreated group was significantly increased compared to the

Control group. These data showed that GA can suppress
the in vivo tumor growth through activating AMPK
signaling and inhibiting critical members involved in
lipogenesis.

Discussion
Cancer metabolism has recently become a hotspot
in the field of cancer research [17]. Recent research has
demonstrated that cancer cells often bear a metabolism
characteristic distancing from that of normal cells [18].
This metabolic rewiring in cancer cells involves aberrantly
activated aerobic glycolysis and enhanced de novo lipid
biosynthesis that was driven by metabolism related
enzymes or genes [19]. In this view, to find drugs targeting
the key enzymes or genes involved in cancer cell specific
metabolic pathways may have the potential to disrupt
tumor cell proliferation and survival without affecting
normal cells, thus providing a powerful new intervention
to treat cancer.
Elevated de novo lipogenesis is one of the most

important hallmarks of altered metabolism in pancreatic
cancer and liver cancer and has been proposed to be a new
drug target for the development of anti-cancer agents [4].
A previous study has indicated that increased lipogenesis
is associated with development and progression of human
hepatocellular carcinoma [20]. The newly synthesized
lipid can be used for building cell membrane during cell
proliferation and providing fuel for rapid growth cancer
cell when demanded. Recently, increasing evidence
suggests that the lipid may play important roles in
signaling transduction associated with tumor growth [21;
22]. Overexpression of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes
was responsible for the elevated lipid biosynthesis in
cancer [23]. Among them, ACC and FASN are two
important enzymes during cell de novo lipogenesis. The
significant role of FASN and ACC in cancer development
has been well established in the past [24; 25]. Elevated
expression of FASN and ACC in cancer cells is related

to markedly worse prognosis in many human cancers,
including pancreatic cancer [4]. Inhibit the expression
of FASN and ACC by metformin prevents liver
tumorigenesis [26]. In this study, our results demonstrated
that GA possesses a potent inhibitory effect on cancer cell
growth both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, de novo lipid
synthesis in cancer cells was dramatically attenuated by
GA. Inhibition of critical genes involved in lipid synthesis
could be the basis of these effects induced by GA.
SREBPs are a family of transcription factors that
regulate lipid homeostasis by regulating the expression
of the core and rate-limiting enzymes involved in lipid
synthesis, including ACC and FASN [27]. Three SREBP
isoforms, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2, have been
identified in mammalian cells. Among them, SREBP-1a
and SREBP-1c were encoded by a same gene SREBF-1
while SREBP-2 was encoded by SREBF-2. The biological
function of SREBP-1 is to control the lipogenic gene

expression while SREBP-2 to regulate the cholesterogenic
gene expression. It has been reported that elevated
expression of SREBP-1 has been detected in several
cancer types and was closely correlated with malignant
transformation, cancer progression and metastasis [28].
Inhibit the expression of SREBP-1 leaded to impaired
tumor growth [23]. The studies we described here showed
that the expression of SREBP-1 was reduced by GA
treatment in pancreatic cancer cells and hepatocellular
carcinoma cells, however, the expression of SREBP-2
remained unchanged. These results indicated GA may only
have an effect on lipid metabolism and has no effect on
cholesterol metabolism.
The cellular energy sensor AMPK is a highly
conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase complex that plays a
crucial role in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism
[29]. Previous study has established AMPK as an
upstream regulator of both lipid and glucose metabolism
[30]. The phosphorylation of AMPK resulted in reduced
lipid biosynthesis via inhibiting the expression of SREBP1c and its target genes, ACC and FASN [31]. Consistent
with this, our study showed that GA significantly
downregulated the expression of genes related to lipid
metabolism accompanied with AMPK activation. And
knockdown AMPK rescued these effects induced by GA.
GA has received much attention for its multitude
biological activities. The purification of GA from Ginkgo
biloba Leaves has been effectively improved. Previous
study indicated that GA may serve as a promising agent
to inhibit HIV protease activity and HIV infection in
vitro [11]. In addition, the molluscicidal property of
GA has been examined [13]. Recently, the antitumor
efficacy of GA has cause increasing attentions. Aberrant
SUMOylation has been found to be implicated in the
development of cancer. It was reported that GA inhibit
protein SUMOylation both in vitro and in vivo [32].
Furthermore, Zhou et al. showed that GA reduced the
viability of various types of cancer cells in a manner of
inhibiting division, retarding the progress of cell cycle
and inducing apoptosis without affecting the viability
of non-tumorigenic cells [14]. Consistently, the present
study demonstrated that GA suppressed the proliferation,
migration, and invasion as well as de novo lipogenesis
of cancer cells. Inducing the activation of AMPK and
inhibiting the critical genes involved in lipogenesis may be
the underlying mechanisms. More importantly, GA has a
relatively safe toxicity profile even at high concentrations
which is fatal to tumor cells.

effects of GA and whether GA has a synergistic effect with
other chemotherapy drugs warrant further study.

Materials and Methods
All experimental protocols were approved by the
relevant Ethical Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital
of Medical College, Xi’an Jiaotong University, China.

Cell culture and reagents
The human pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1 and
BxPC-3 were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and maintained
as previously described. HepG2 (human hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line), HL-7702 (human normal hepatocyte)
and HUVEC were kindly provided by Dr. Chang Liu
(Medical College, Xi’an Jiaotong University) and cultured
as per their instructions. GA (C15:1; C22H34O3; molecular
weight: 346.50), Oil Red O, and MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium
bromide)
were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). GA
was initially dissolved in pure methanol at the stock
concentration of 1mM. Working dilutions for GA were
made in culture medium immediately before use with
10μM of methanol used as control in all experiments. The
antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table 1.

Cell viability assay
Cancer cell lines(Panc-1, BxPC-3 and HepG2) and
two normal cell lines(HL-7702 and HUVEC) were plated
into 96-well plates at a density of 5 ×103 cells per well and
treated with various concentrations (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50,
and 100μM) of GA. At the indicated time points (12, 24,
36, and 48h), cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay
and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a multiwell microplate reader (BIO-TEC Inc, VA).

Apoptosis assay
Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry with
an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit (Beyotime
Instituteof Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, Cancer cells were
seeded into 6-well plates a density of 1×105 cells per

microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S, Japan) at magnif﻿﻿ication
of 40×.

Oil Red O staining

Wound-scratch assay
Wound-scratch assay was performed to detect the
migration ability of cancer cells. Briefly, Cancer cells were
serum-starved overnight and then pre-treated with GA in
6-well plates for 24h. The monolayers were then scratched
with a 200μl sterile pipette tip. Floating cells were washed
off with PBS, and the adherent cells were maintained in
serum-free media. Images of the same fields were acquired
by microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.) at a magnification
of 100× at two preselected time points (0 h and 24 h).

The Oil Red O staining was used to visualize the
lipid droplets in cancer cells. Cells were washed with
PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and
then stained with pre-warmed 0.25% Oil Red O working
solution (0.5% Oil Red O was diluted with propylene
glycol for long-term storage, and working dilutions were
made immediately before use with ddH2O) for 15 minutes
in 60 ºC oven. After being washed twice with PBS, the
cells were photographed under the light microscope
(Nikon Eclipse Ti-S, Japan) at magnification of 200×.

Matrigel-invasion assay

Quantitative real-time PCR

For cell invasion assessment, Transwell chamber
assays were performed using Transwell chambers
(Millipore, USA) according to a protocol described
previously [33]. In brief, cancer cells were serum-starved
overnight and then pre-treated with GA for 24h. Then cells
were suspended and added to the upper chamber of the
Transwell chambers that were coated with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, USA) before experiment. The non-invasive
cells were slightly removed from the upper surface by a
cotton-tipped swab after 24h incubation. Invading cells on
the bottom surface of the filter were fixed and then stained
with 0.1% crystal violet. The invading cell numbers were
quantified by counting the stained cells under microscope
(Nikon Instruments Inc.) at a magnification of 200×.

Total cell RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Then cDNA synthesis was performed using
a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China).
Real-time PCR was performed with an iQ5 Multicolor
Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA) using a SYBR Green PCR Kit (TaKaRa)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
amplification consisted of predenaturation at 94°C for 4
min, denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for
30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s for 40 cycles. The
primer sequences used are listed in Supplementary Table
3. The ΔΔCT method was used to calculate the Relative
expression of the sample genes with β-actin as the
normalized reference gene.

RNA interference

Western blotting analysis

To knockdown AMPK expression, three AMPKspecific siRNAs and one negative control siRNA were
designed and synthesized by GenePharma Co., Ltd
(Shanghai, China). The siRNA sequences are provided in
Supplementary Table 2. The transfection was performed
as previously described [33]. The cells were used for
subsequent experiments 24 h after transfection.

Total proteins were extracted by RIPA Lysis Buffer
(Beyotime, Guangzhou, China) and the concentration of
proteins was determined using the BCA protein assay kit
(Pierce, Rockford, USA) according to the Manufacturer’s
instruction. Then Western blotting assay was performed
as previously described [34]. The protein expression
was visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence
(Millipore, USA). Images were captured using the
ChemiDoc XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad, USA)
and Quantity One image software was used for the
densitometry analysis of each band. β-actin was used as
an internal loading control.

Colony formation assay
1000 Cells were seeded into 35-mm petri dish and
allowed overnight to adhere. The next day, GA (final
concentration is 20μM) was added to the dishes for 24 h
following which media was replaced with drug free media.
Cells were further cultured for 2 weeks to allow colonies
to form. At indicated time point, colonies were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and then stained with 0.1% crystal
violet solution, rinsed and then imaged. And the number
of colonies > 0.5mm in diameter was counted by using a

established by the relevant Ethical Committee of the First
Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Xi’an Jiaotong
University. 5 × 105 BxPc-3 cells mixed with 1 × 105 PSCs
(PSCs were isolate and cultured as previously described)
were resuspended in 30μl HBSS and then injected to the
subcutaneous of the right back of nude mice. After one
week, animals were randomly divided into two groups,
the first group received vehicle (100μl saline) by oral
gavage (Control group, n = 10); the other group was
administered with GA (suspended in saline, 50 mg/kg) via
gastric gavage daily for 4 weeks (GA group, n=10). The
tumors’ dimensions were monitored with vernier calipers
every 2 days throughout the experiment, and the tumor
volume was calculated using the following formula: V
(tumor volume) = d (shorter diameter) 2 ×D (longer
diameter) ×0.5. At the end of the experimental period of
6 weeks, the mice were euthanized and individual tumor
weights were measured. The tumor samples were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.
Serial sections of 4 mm were cut for hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining
as previously described [35].

Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as means ± standard
deviation (SD). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used to evaluate the statistical significance between
groups with Dunnett’s test for post-hoc analysis, using
SPSS (version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). P value
< 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Each
experiment was performed at least for three times.
