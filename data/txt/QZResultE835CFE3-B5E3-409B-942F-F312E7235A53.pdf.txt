BACKGROUND. Talactoferrin (TLF), a recombinant form of human lactoferrin
(hLF), is an immunomodulatory iron-binding glycoprotein first identified in
breast milk. Its immunomodulatory functions include activation of natural killer
(NK) and lymphokine-activated killer cells and enhancement of polymorphonuclear cells and macrophage cytotoxicity. Studies in animal models have shown
promising anticancer activity, and clinical antitumor activity has been observed
in nonsmall cell lung cancer and other tumor types. The purpose of the current
study was to evaluate the activity and safety of TLF in patients with refractory
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

METHODS. Forty-four adult patients with progressive advanced or metastatic RCC
who had failed prior systemic therapy received oral talactoferrin at a dose of
1.5 g twice daily on a 12-week-on 2-week-off schedule. Patients were evaluated
for progression-free survival at 14 weeks, overall response rate, and progressionfree and overall survival.
RESULTS. TLF was well tolerated. No significant hematologic, hepatic, or renal
toxicities were reported. The study met its predefined target with a 14-week progression-free survival rate of 59%. The response rate was 4.5%. The mMedian
progression-free survival was 6.4 months and the median overall survival was
21.1 months.

CONCLUSIONS. TLF is a well-tolerated new agent that has demonstrated prelimi-

progression in this cohort, and the preclinical data on immune activation, a randomized study assessing its effects on disease progression in patients with meta-

enal cell carcinoma (RCC) affects >40,000 patients per year in
the U.S. and is responsible for close to 13,000 deaths.1 Once
metastatic, RCC is difficult to treat, and median survival is between
1 and 2 years.2–4 Several different treatment modalities are available
for metastatic RCC, including immunotherapy, mTOR inhibitors,
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway-targeted
therapies.3–7 Although each modality provides some benefit in a
subset of patients, complete response is exceedingly rare, and the
majority of patients with metastatic RCC die of their disease. Additional therapy is clearly needed.
Talactoferrin is a unique recombinant form of human lactoferrin, an important immunomodulatory protein. Lactoferrin, an 80kilodalton (kD) member of the transferrin family of iron-binding
glycoproteins,8 is expressed throughout the body and is found in
the highest concentrations in breast milk. Lactoferrin is also present

in immune cells and on all body surfaces exposed to
the external environment (eg, intestinal mucosal surfaces). Lactoferrin plays an important role in helping
to establish the immune system, including the gutassociated lymphoid tissue (GALT), in infants and is
involved in cellular growth and differentiation, antimicrobial
defense,
antiinflammatory
activity,
immune modulation, and cancer protection.9–14
Talactoferrin is produced in Aspergillus niger,15 a filamentous fungus, and is structurally identical to
native human lactoferrin in all material respects, differing only in its glycosylation.
After oral administration, talactoferrin is transported into the Peyer patches of the GALT, in which
it recruits immature circulating dendritic cells (DCs)
bearing tumor antigens to the GALT and induces
their maturation. DC maturation in the presence of
tumor antigens and lymphoid effector cells induces a
strong systemic innate and adaptive immune
response mediated by anticancer natural killer (NK)
and NK-T cells,1,2 and CD81 lymphocytes and NK-T
cells. This results in the activation of lymphocytes in
tumor-draining lymph nodes (unpublished data), cellular infiltration of distant tumors,3 and tumor-cell
death. Talactoferrin is not systemically bioavailable,4,5 and mounting the initial immune response in
the GALT (away from the primary tumor and using a
physiologically important pathway) may help minimize the effect of the cancer’s local immunosuppressive defenses.
In phase 1 clinical studies, oral talactoferrin was
found to be well tolerated without the occurrence of
dose-limiting toxicities, and a maximum tolerated
dose could not be defined.16 Seven patients with
advanced or metastatic RCC who were heavily pretreated were evaluated in a phase 1b study. All 7
patients demonstrated tumor shrinkage or a reduction in tumor growth rate, and 4 patients remained
progression-free for >6 months, with 3 patients
receiving talactoferrin for >2 years. One patient had
a durable partial response with 71% tumor shrinkage
by standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria.17
Two double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2
studies have been conducted in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with both studies
meeting their prespecified endpoints. A 110-patient
study in previously untreated patients with NSCLC
evaluated talactoferrin or placebo in combination
with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The talactoferrin arm
demonstrated an improvement in response rate with
trends toward improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).18 A second
study in patients who had failed 1 or 2 prior regi-

73

mens of chemotherapy enrolled 100 patients who
received talactoferrin or placebo in addition to best
supportive care. Patients in the talactoferrin arm
demonstrated an improvement in OS with trends in
improvement noted in PFS.19
Based on these encouraging preliminary findings,
a phase 2 study in patients with advanced RCC was
conducted and is reported herein. A talactoferrin
dose of 1.5 g administered orally twice daily was chosen for this and other phase 2 studies. Primary endpoints included 14-week PFS and response rate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was opened at 6 sites and Institutional
Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained at each
site before the initiation of patient enrollment. Funding for the study was provided by the study sponsor
(Agennix, Houston, Tex). All patients signed informed
consent as per institutional guidelines. Eligible
patients had histologically confirmed metastatic or
unresectable RCC with predominantly clear cell histology, and had failed at least 1 systemic therapy.
Computed tomography (CT) documentation of disease progression within 9 months of the completion
of the most recent therapy was required, and target
lesions had to be measurable according to RECIST.
This determination was investigator-based. The Karnofsky performance status had to be >70, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, hemoglobin
10 g/dL, neutrophil count 2000/mm3, lymphocyte
count 800/mm3, platelet count 100 000/mm3,
aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase <2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal, serum calcium 11.5 mg/dL, international
normalized ratio (INR) 1.2, and forced expiratory
volume in 1 second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity
(FVC) 60% of predicted. Patients with brain metastases, active ischemic heart disease, symptomatic
congestive heart failure, serious active infection,
autoimmune disease, radiotherapy administered
within 4 weeks, and other malignancies diagnosed
within 5 years (apart from nonmelanoma skin cancer) were excluded.
Patients received recombinant human lactoferrin
(rhLF) at a dose of 1.5 mg orally twice daily for 12
consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week break. A
maximum of 2 additional cycles were permitted. The
first CT scan was obtained at baseline, followed by
scans at Weeks 8, 14, 21, 27, 34, 41, 48, and 55. Radiologic response was assessed by the investigator.
Patients were followed for OS for 12 months from
the initiation of the study treatment or until the median OS for the study was determined, whichever

74

occurred later, but not longer than 18 months after
the last patient was enrolled.
The study’s coprimary endpoints were to detect
a PFS rate of 40% at 14 weeks or a 12.5% response
rate, either of which were considered to be clinically
significant. In a phase 2 trial of bevacizumab in second-line RCC patients, the placebo arm had a 4month PFS rate of 20%20 and was chosen as the historic reference. A sample size of 40 patients provided
>80% power to detect an increase in the 14-week
PFS from 20% to 40%, with 1-tailed a of 0.05. An
early stopping rule stated that the study would be
terminated if there were no radiologic responses after
the first 20 patients were enrolled, or fewer than 10%
of the first 20 patients were alive and free of disease
progression at 14 weeks.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between September 2004 and February 2005, 44
patients were enrolled at 6 sites. All patients were
evaluable for toxicity and response; therefore, all
data are presented in the intent-to-treat population.
Twenty-two patients (50%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
and the remainder had an ECOG performance status
of 1 (Table 1). By revised Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center criteria for previously treated patients,
27 patients (61%) were low risk and 17 patients
(39%) were intermediate risk. The median age was
64 years and 28 patients (64%) were male. Approximately 80% of the patients were white. Thirteen
patients (30%) had received 3 prior therapies; 80%
had received cytokines, 61% had received chemotherapy, and 32% had received investigational agents,
including 7 who received sorafenib, 5 who received
ABX-EGF, 2 who received temsirolimus, and 1 who
received sunitinib. The median time from first diagnosis to treatment was 35.5 months.
Drug Administration and Tolerability
Twenty-nine patients (66%) completed cycle 1 of
therapy and 20 patients (46%) completed 2 cycles.
Talactoferrin was well tolerated. Forty-two patients
(96%) reported at least 1 adverse event (AE), and 23
(52%) reported at least 1 related AE. Of the related
AEs, the most common were fatigue, flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, although none were
>grade 2 in severity (Table 2) (determined according
to the Common Toxicity Criteria [CTC] grading system). One case of grade 3 dyspnea was considered to
be possibly related to the study drug (Table 2). There
were no drug-related serious AEs reported.

Patient Outcomes
The 14-week PFS was 59% (P < .0001 for comparison
with 20%), meeting a prespecified study endpoint.
The response rate was 4.5%, with 70.5% of patients
demonstrating stable disease for at least 8 weeks
(Table 3). The median PFS was 6.4 months (1-sided
95% confidence interval [95% CI] of 4.7). The median
OS was 21.1 months (1-sided 95% CI of 19.5) and the
1-year survival rate was 77% (Table 4).
The first responder was a 47-year-old woman
who underwent surgical resection of a T3bN2M0
RCC in 2003 and who demonstrated pulmonary, retroperitoneal, and bone metastases shortly after surgery. She developed disease progression while
receiving interferon therapy. Treatment with talactoferrin was initiated and the patient demonstrated a
near-complete resolution of her adrenal metastasis
and sclerosis of her bone lesion. There was no evidence of disease recurrence at the time of last follow-up, nearly 2 years from the last dose of
talactoferrin. The second responder was a 59-yearold man who was diagnosed in January 2004 with
metastatic RCC. He was treated with interleukin-2,
with progression of disease occurring during treatment. Treatment with talactoferrin was initiated
3.5 months after the completion of interleukin-2

at Week 22.
After developing disease progression while
receiving talactoferrin, 33 patients (75%) received at
least 1 subsequent therapy, whereas 11 patients (25%)
did not. Eighteen patients received sorafenib, 9 patients received bevacizumab, and 7 patients received
sunitinib.

DISCUSSION
Over the past few decades, immunomodulatory therapy has shown promise in patients with RCC, but
significant advances using this approach have been
frustrated by the idiosyncratic response characteristics and significant toxicities. On 1 end of the toxicity
spectrum, vaccines have demonstrated immunologic
activity in several trials, but have not been demonstrated to provide definitive patient benefit.21 Problems include finding immunostimulatory protein
epitopes, establishing optimal delivery platforms,
and developing reliable immunologic endpoints that
approximate clinical benefit. On the other end of the

toxicity spectrum lie the cytokines. High-dose interleukin-2, which was approved in 1992 by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic RCC on the basis of a small number of complete
responses, is a highly challenging agent to administer
and benefits only a few patients who receive it. Once
again, consistent predictors of treatment response
have by and large eluded investigators, and efforts to
prospectively validate predictors of interleukin-2
response continue. A further challenge in developing
effective immunotherapy is the absence of laboratory
endpoints that correlate with clinical benefit. Investigators are thus never sure how close they are to
achieving a meaningful impact on tumor biology.
There is a clear unmet need for effective, welltolerated immunomodulatory agents that can be
used either as monotherapy or as adjuncts to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or antivascular therapies.
Oral talactoferrin is an immunomodulatory molecule
that has shown promising antitumor activity in preclinical models and in a variety of solid tumors.
Talactoferrin’s postulated DC activation mechanism,
which combines the 2 halves of standard immunotherapeutic approaches (antigen presentation
through in-migration of immature DCs and activa-

76

CANCER July 1, 2008 / Volume 113 / Number 1

tion of the immune system through DC maturation)
appears to hold promise in a challenging field. The
data from 2 randomized studies in lung cancer
patients indicate early evidence of talactoferrin’s clinical efficacy in solid tumors, and provide a context
with which the data in this article can be interpreted.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
phase 2 study assessing the efficacy of oral talactoferrin in patients with refractory RCC. The patients
enrolled on the study were heavily pretreated. The
prespecified effect on 14-week PFS was met, with the
59% observed value being statistically significantly
increased over the historic reference of 20% (P <
.0001), and greater than the targeted value of 40%.
Although the study by Yang et al.20 on which the historic PFS was based used World Health Organization
(WHO) measurement criteria, a comparison of WHO
criteria with RECIST to our knowledge has not
demonstrated a consistent difference in outcome
measures.22–24 Data from contemporary clinical trials
were not available when this study was designed. In
the randomized trial comparing sorafenib with placebo, after 3 months of treatment, 255 patients receiving sorafenib (57%) achieved a complete or partial
response or stable disease compared with 152 patients
receiving placebo (34%).3 A post hoc comparison
using these data still shows a statistically significant
improvement in the PFS rate when compared with
the current study (P < .001).
Responses were noted in 2 patients, but the
response rate endpoint was not met. Nevertheless,
the observed response rate was consistent with talactoferrin’s cytostatic mechanism of action and also
was consistent with the response rate observed with
other cytostatic agents such as sorafenib and bevacizumab. The results on secondary efficacy endpoints
including median PFS (6.4 months) and median OS
(21.1 months) compare favorably with those reported
in the literature in patients with previously treated
RCC.3,20 Patient selection could explain these results,
although analysis of the patient characteristics does
not reveal these patients to be significantly different
from those in other phase 2 trials.
A more definitive demonstration of talactoferrin’s
potential growth inhibitory properties would require
a randomized trial. This could, for example, be a randomized discontinuation trial, although combination
with other active agents may be more attractive. For
example, clinical data with talactoferrin in NSCLC
have suggested that talactoferrin can enhance the activity of chemotherapy. The additive effect of chemotherapy could potentially be explained by the
presumed larger number of tumor antigens available
as a result of increased tumor cell killing by chemo-

therapy. The larger repertoire of tumor antigens
available to the DCs activated by talactoferrin could
subsequently result in a greater activation of
downstream effector cells responsible for tumor cell
killing.
For RCC, in which to our knowledge classic cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been effective to date,
combination with 1 of the newer VEGF pathway-targeted agents is a practical choice. Data suggest that
the immunologic response in patients with cancer
may be decreased by high levels of circulating VEGF,25
and preclinical studies suggest that the addition of
talactoferrin to sunitinib resulted in enhanced activity
(unpublished data). Combination trials with newer
agents has often been challenging because of overlapping toxicities, but the attractive safety profile of
talactoferrin makes combination trials more feasible.
In summary, talactoferrin is a novel agent that is
well tolerated and has demonstrated evidence of
potential clinical activity in RCC. Although patient
selection may contribute to the results noted in the
current study, randomized trials, including possibly
evaluating the combination of talactoferrin with a
VEGF pathway-targeted agent, are necessary to validate these observations.
