Abstract:
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a dismal disease with a poor
prognosis and targeted therapies have failed in the clinic so far. Several evidences
point to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-mTOR pathway as a promising
signaling node for targeted therapeutic intervention. Markers, which predict
responsiveness of PDAC cells towards PI3K inhibitors are unknown. However, such
markers are needed and critical to better stratify patients in clinical trials.
We used a large murine KrasG12D- and PI3K (p110αH1047R)-driven PDAC cell line
platform to unbiased define modulators of responsiveness towards the dual PI3KmTOR inhibitor Bez235. In contrast to other tumor models, we show that KrasG12D- and
PI3K (p110αH1047R)-driven PDAC cell lines are equally sensitive towards Bez235. In an
unbiased approach we found that the extracellular matrix protein Efemp1 controls
sensitivity of murine PDAC cells towards Bez235. We show that Efemp1 expression
is connected to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. In a murine KrasG12Ddriven PDAC model, p27Kip1 haploinsufficiency accelerates cancer development in vivo.
Furthermore, p27Kip1 controls Bez235 sensitivity in a gene dose-dependent fashion
in murine PDAC cells and lowering of p27Kip1 decreases Bez235 responsiveness in
murine PDAC models.
Together, we define the Efemp1-p27Kip1 axis as a potential marker module of
PDAC cell sensitivity towards dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors, which might help to better
stratify patients in clinical trials.

Introduction

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) build
a conserved group of lipid kinases, composed of
catalytically and regulatory subunits, which phosphorylate
the 3` hydroxyl group of phosphatidylinositols, whereby
generating phophatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate
(PI(3,4,5)P3) from PI(4,5)P2 at the inner plasma
membrane [2]. Intracellular PIP3 levels are tightly
regulated by the tumor suppressor phosphatase and

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains
a dismal disease with a median survival under six months
and a five-year survival rate of 5% [1]. No effective
therapies for locally advanced or metastatic tumors
exist, demonstrating the need to define novel therapeutic
strategies and markers, which predict responsiveness.

tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN),
which dephosphorylates PIP3 and therefore terminates
PI3K signaling [3]. PIP3-induced proximity between the
phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and
the AKT kinase allows PDK1 to phophorylate threonine
308 of AKT1 [2]. The PTEN-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
is frequently deregulated in PDAC. At the genetic level,
mutations in the catalytical active class Ia PI3K subunit
p110α [4](www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) and
the regulatory subunit p85α [5] as well as amplification of
AKT2 [6] were described. Accordingly, mutant p110αH1047R
can initiate and drive the carcinogenesis in the murine
pancreas and the PI3K-PDK1 pathway is an essential node
for KrasG12D-driven murine PDAC [7]. Furthermore, PTEN
expression is lost or significantly reduced in human PDAC
cell lines and tumor specimens [8] and surrogate markers
of PI3K activity, like phosphorylation of AKT [7, 9, 10],
were commonly detected in human and murine PDAC.
Of note, AKT phosphorylation is inversely correlated
with survival of PDAC patients [9, 11, 12]. Functionally,
PI3K signaling is linked to processes like proliferation,
therapeutic/apoptosis resistance, control of metabolism
and angiogenesis in PDAC [13].
Due to the frequent activation of the PI3K pathway,
PI3K inhibitors are promising therapeutic targets in solid
tumors [14] including PDAC [13]. In agreement, the
imidazoquinoline dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor Bez235
revealed efficacy in in vivo models of PDAC [15,
16]. Furthermore, the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor GDC
0941 prevented tumor progression in an endogenous
genetically defined mouse model and a humanized
primary orthotopic xenotransplant model of PDAC [7].
Nevertheless, markers, which predict and modulate the
response towards PI3K-mTOR inhibitors in PDAC are ill
defined. In an attempt to unbiased define modulators of
PI3K inhibitor sensitivity, we used a large murine PDAC
cell line platform. We demonstrate here that Efemp1 as
well as p27Kip1 axis controls responsiveness of PDAC cells
towards Bez235.

in the mean IC50 values of murine KrasG12D-driven (mean
IC50 value: 9.85 +/- 1.15 nmol/L) and p110αH1047R-driven
(mean IC50 value: 7.51 +/- 0.97 nmol/L) PDAC cells was
detected (figure 1B), arguing that the PI3K pathway is
equally important to maintain viability in both models
investigated. Interestingly, cell lines isolated from
metastases reveal significantly higher IC50 values (mean
IC50 value: 12.15 +/- 1.97 nmol/l) compared to cell lines
isolated from primary PDAC (mean IC50 value: 7.43
+/- 0.72 nmol/L) (figure 1C). In contrast to the high
sensitivity of the murine PDAC cell lines towards Bez235,
IC50 values for the mTOR inhibitor Rad001 are high
ranging from 0.28 to 6.49 µmol/L (supplemental table
1), which might argue for a significant contribution of the
PI3K inhibition for the Bez235 sensitivity.
To unbiased find genes differentially expressed
in murine PDAC cells sensitive to Bez235, we used
microarrays available from 28 murine PDAC cell lines.
We defined two groups according to an Bez235 IC50 cutoff
of 10 nmol/L that best separates the available 28 cell
lines with high and low Bez235 IC50 values. The 50 most
significant genes that are differentially expressed in cell
lines with low and high Bez235 IC50 values are shown in
figure 1D. The gene, which was statistically significantly
differentially expressed between cells with a low and high
IC50 value and revealed the greatest expression difference
in both groups, was the EGF-containing fibulin-like
extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1/Fibulin3) gene (log
fold-change -4.7, p-value 0.02) (figure 1D).

Efemp1 expression correlates with Bez235 IC50
values
Efemp1 belongs to the Fibulin protein family of
secreted glycoproteins, which are components of the
extracellular matrix [18]. When array mRNA expression
data of 28 cell lines for Efemp1 were correlated with
Bez235 IC50 values, a Spearman correlation coefficient
of r=0.86 (p<0.0001) was calculated (figure 2A). To
corroborate the array expression data, we quantified
Efemp1 mRNA expression in 35 murine PDAC cell lines
using qPCR (figure 2B). Again, a significant correlation of
Efemp1 with Bez235 IC50 values was evident (Spearman
correlation coefficient of r=0.62; p<0.0001) (figure 2C),
arguing that Efemp1 is a marker for Bez235 sensitivity.

Efemp1 increases sensitivity towards Bez235

To determine the sensitivity of murine KrasG12Ddriven or p110αH1047R-driven PDAC cells towards the dual
PI3K/mTor inhibitor Bez235, we treated 35 cell lines
with Bez235 for 72 hours. Viability was measured using
MTT assays and the IC50 values were calculated using a
non-linear regression analysis [17]. IC50 values between
2.4 nmol/L for the most sensitive up to 30.8 nmol/L
were determined (figure 1A). Statistics can be found in
supplemental table 1. No statistically significant difference

To demonstrate a functional relevance of Efemp1
modulating Bez235 sensitivity we used gain- and loss-offunction studies. We stably transfected the murine ASC5193 cell line (IC50 high) with an Efemp1 expression
vector. Figure 3A, demonstrates increased expression of
the Efemp1 mRNA in two clones compared to control
transfected cells. We were not able to detect murine

Bez235 leads to PI3K pathway inhibition, as measured
by dephosphorylation of AKT and S6, irrespectively of
the stable transfection of Efemp1 (figure 3B). However,
as suggested by the correlation of Efemp1 expression
with Bez235 IC50 values, elevation of Efemp1 expression
increased the sensitivity of murine ASC-5193 towards
Bez235 (figure 3C).
In addition to the gain-of-function approach, we

used RNAi to demonstrate the effects of Efemp1 towards
the Bez235 sensitivity in the murine PPT-53631 cells (IC50
low) as well as in human BxPc3 cells. Knockdown of
Efemp1 in PPT-53631 and BxPc3 cells was demonstrated
at the level of mRNA using qPCR in PPT-53631 (figure
3D, left graph) and BxPc3 cells (figure 3E, left graph).
Reducing Efemp1 expression decreased Bez235 sensitivity
in PPT-53631 (figure 3D, right graph) and BxPc3 cells
(figure 3E, right graph). Together, these data demonstrate

that Efemp1 modulates sensitivity towards Bez235 in cellbased PDAC models.

Protein turnover of p27Kip1 was not changed in ASC-5193
cells, irrespectively of Efemp1 expression (figure 4D).
Consistently, the expression of a main regulator of p27Kip1
degradation in PDAC cells, the F-box protein S-phase
kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2) [19], was not changed
in the stable Efemp1 transfected ASC-5193 clones (figure
4E). To confirm the correlation of p27Kip1 and Bez235
responsiveness, we measured p27Kip1 protein expression
in murine PDAC cell lines with different IC50 values.
Consistent with the data from stable Efemp1 transfected
ASC-5193 cells, p27Kip1 was higher expressed in murine
PDAC cell lines with lower Bez235 IC50 values (figure
4F).

Efemp1 increases the expression of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1
Since we have demonstrated that inhibition of
the PI3K pathway in human PDAC models induces
a cytostatic response with a G1-phase arrest in the cell
cycle involving the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p27Kip1 [19, 20] and p27Kip1 was recently shown to control
sensitivity towards dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition [21], we
investigated p27Kip1 in ASC-5193 overexpressing Efemp1.
p27Kip1 protein levels were significantly elevated in stably
Efemp1 transfected clones compared to the control clone
(figure 4A). Increased p27Kip1 protein was distributed in
the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the investigated ASC5193 clones (figure 4A, right panel). Consistently, RNAi
targeting Efemp1 leads to the downregulation of p27Kip1
protein expression in murine PPT-3202 and PPT-53631
cells (figure 4B). Knockdown in PPT2-3202 and PPT53631 cells was controlled at the level of Efemp1 mRNA
expression (data not shown).
To investigate how Efemp1 controls p27Kip1 protein
expression, we measured p27Kip1 mRNA expression and
protein turnover. A slight increase in p27Kip1 mRNA
expression was observed in stably Efemp1 transfected
ASC-5193 cells compared to controls (figure 4C).

p27Kip1 haploinsufficiency accelerates cancer
development in a murine KrasG12D-driven PDAC
model
To demonstrate the modulatory effect of p27Kip1
towards the PI3K inhibitor response at the genetic level,
we attempted to generate p27Kip1+/- and p27Kip1-/- murine
PDAC cell lines. We crossed the p27Kip1 knockout mouse
line [22] into the Ptf1aCre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+ (KC mice
thereafter) mouse model of PDAC [23]. Kaplan-Meier
analysis demonstrated that p27Kip1 haploinsufficiency
accelerates cancer development in the investigated model
(figure 5A). PDACs developing in KCp27Kip1+/- (figure
5B, II) mice are differentiated ductal adenocarcinomas as

observed in KC mice (figure 5B, I). Furthermore, there is
a tendency of an increased macroscopic metastasis rate
into lymph nodes, liver and lungs in KCp27Kip1+/- mice
(KC, n=43, 39.1% macroscopic metastasis; KCp27Kip1+/-,
n=13, 69.2% macroscopic metastasis; Fisher`s exact test
p=0.067). Although KCp27Kip1-/- mice die with a median
survival of 179 days (figure 5A), no invasive cancers
were detected (figure 5B, III). Histological, pancreata
of KCp27Kip1-/- mice show desmoplastic reaction with
numerous PanIN lesions (figure 5B, III). Pancreata of
KCp27Kip1-/- mice are massively enlarged (figure 5B, IV
and 5C), leading to obstruction of the surrounding GItract and subsequent death. Furthermore, cell lines isolated
from KCp27Kip1-/- tumors undergo a senescence crisis in
vitro (figure 5B, V).

dose-dependent manner.
To further establish the role of p27Kip1 as a regulator
of Bez235 sensitivity, we reduced the expression of p27Kip1
by increasing Skp2 expression in the murine PPT-6554
cell line and the human MiaPaCa2 cell line. Increasing the
expression of Skp2 leads to a significant downregulation
of p27Kip1 in PPT-6554 (figure 6D, left panel) and
MiaPaCa2 cells (figure 6E, left panel). Lowering p27Kip1
by Skp2 decreases sensitivity of PPT-6554 (figure 6D,
right graph) and MiaPaCa2 (figure 6E, right graph) cells
for Bez235, further supporting the notion that p27Kip1 is
an important regulator of Bez235 sensitivity in cell-based
PDAC models.

p27Kip1 expression levels determine Bez235
sensitivity

A goal of personalized medicine is to stratify patients
to maximize therapeutic responses to specific targeted
therapies. Therefore, there is the need to gain insights into
the molecular mode of action of targeted therapies and to
define markers and modulators of responsiveness. Here we
used a large murine PDAC cell line platform to unbiased
find modulators of the response towards the dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor Bez235. By the use of gain- and lossof-function experiments, we demonstrate that Efemp1 and
p27Kip1 are involved in the control of Bez235 sensitivity of
PDAC cells in this preclinical model.
In several tumor entities predictive markers for
responsiveness towards PI3K-AKT pathway inhibition
were described, whereat genetic lesions in the components

Discussion

Expression levels of p27Kip1 were downregulated at
protein (figure 6A) and mRNA (figure 6B) level in cell
lines from KCp27Kip1+/- mice compared to KC cell lines.
p27Kip1 protein and mRNA expression was absent in cell
lines from KCp27Kip1-/- mice (figure 6A and 6B). To prove
the contribution of p27Kip1 towards the control of Bez235
sensitivity, IC50 values of four cell lines from KCp27Kip1+/as well as cell lines from KCp27Kip1-/- tumors were
determined and compared to the IC50 values of p27Kip1proficient PDAC cell lines (n=35). As shown in figure 6C,
lowering p27Kip1 expression increased IC50 values in a gene

of the PI3K-AKT pathway were found positively
correlated with PI3K inhibitor sensitivity. Consistently,
p110α mutation and/or loss of PTEN expression may
characterize sensitive cancer cells [24-29]. Although a
low number of patients were included, a recent clinical
trial reported increased response rates towards PI3KAKT-mTOR inhibitors, when patients with gynecologic
malignancies were stratified with regard to the presence
of a p110α mutation [30]. Consistent, an increased
response rate towards PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors in
p110α mutated cancers was recently confirmed in a
retrospective study [31]. In addition to genetic changes,
surrogate marker of PI3K pathway activation, like
phosphorylation of AKT, denote increased flux through
the signaling pathway and therefore may indicate PI3K
inhibitor sensitivity in some cancer models investigated
[32, 33]. However, discrepant results for genetic markers
as well as pathway activation markers to predict PI3K
inhibitor sensitivity were reported. For example, no
correlation of the PTEN status with the responsiveness of
breast cancer cells towards GDC 0941 was detected [26]
and neither p110 nor PTEN mutations were correlated
with PI3K inhibitor sensitivity in the JFCR39 human
cancer cell line panel [33]. Furthermore, no correlation
between basal activity of PI3K-AKT signaling and
the potency of Bez235 to induce dephosphorylation of
AKT was observed [24] and the extend of inhibition of

the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway at the biochemical
level induced by PI3K inhibitors does not predict the
biological response [34]. These results argue that tumortype specificities contribute to the discrepant results
with respect to markers predicting the response towards
PI3K inhibitors. This notion is now also corroborated by
our results. Concordantly, mutations in the oncogenes
KRAS or BRAF are reported to confer resistance towards
PI3K pathway inhibitors [24, 26, 33, 35, 36]. Consistent,
murine p110αH1047R-driven lung cancers respond to Bez235
therapy, whereas murine KrasG12D-driven lung cancers do
not [37]. In contrast our preclinical murine PDAC cell line
platform demonstrates that murine PDAC cells are equally
sensitive towards Bez235, irrespectively whether they are
initiated and driven by p110αH1047R or KrasG12D oncogenes.
These data argue that I) the PI3K pathway is an important
node and target for therapeutic intervention in PDAC and
II) that each tissue has its unique and specific signaling
requirements for tumor maintenance. Furthermore, tumor
entity specific markers might be necessary to predict
sensitivity towards PI3K inhibition.
The combined partial/complete response rate
of p110α mutated cancers towards PI3K-AKT-mTOR
inhibitors is only 18% to 30% [30, 31], arguing that further
markers predicting responsiveness towards these targeted
therapies are needed. We detected the Efemp1 gene
differentially expressed in murine PDAC cells with low

and high sensitivity for Bez235. Efemp1 belongs to the
fibulin protein family, glycoproteins of the extracellular
matrix consisting out of Fibulin 1 to 7 [18]. Efemp1 can
conduct pro-tumorigenic as well as tumor-suppressive
functions dependent on the cancer type. In PDAC, Efemp1
mRNA was upregulated in 13 of 15 investigated cancer
specimens [38]. Efemp1 mRNA expression was variable
increased ranging from 1.5 to over 10 fold induction in
cancers compared to normal tissues [38]. This is consistent
with our expression analysis in the murine PDAC cell line
platform, which also demonstrates a variable expression
of the Efemp1 mRNA. The variable expression of Efemp1
might argue that high Efemp1 expression characterizes a

subtype of PDAC. Since our gain- and loss-of-function
studies shows that high Efemp1 expression increases the
responsiveness towards Bez235, this PDAC subtype might
benefit from PI3K inhibitors.
Considering recent observations that Efemp1
can easily be detected in serum of patients with
pleural mesothelioma and that high serum Efemp1
levels discriminates asbestos-exposed persons without
mesothelioma from asbestos-exposed persons with
mesothelioma [39], points to an avenue to include Efemp1
serum levels as a biomarker in trials with PI3K-mTOR
inhibitors in PDAC. However, high Efemp1 serum levels
were not detected in breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian
cancer, lung cancer (with effusion) or glioblastoma [39].
Therefore, the definite prove that a PDAC subgroup with
high Efemp1 serum levels exists and responds to PI3KmTOR inhibitors, awaits further clinical investigations.
Mechanistically, Efemp1 was shown to promote
metastasis, cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance
in a human PDAC model [38]. To induce changes in
cellular behavior of tumor cells, Efemp1 acts in a paraand autocrine fashion by modulating signaling pathways
like the EGF receptor pathway [40] or the NOTCH
pathway [41]. We detected that the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 is connected to Efemp1 expression.
Loss of p27Kip1 expression, which occurs in 50-70% of
PDACs, is a marker for poor prognosis of the disease [4244]. Consistent, we observed acceleration of the KrasG12Ddriven carcinogenesis in the pancreas of p27Kip1+/- mice.
Furthermore, we provide genetic evidence that higher
p27Kip1 expression increases the sensitivity of PDAC cells
for Bez235, which might characterize p27Kip1 as a further
predictive marker for PI3K-mTOR inhibitor sensitivity in
PDAC. Interestingly, p27Kip1 was shown to be predictive
for dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor sensitivity in a cell-based
model of pituitary adenomas from rats with multiple
endocrine neoplasia-like syndrom [21] and p27Kip1
expression correlated with rapalog sensitivity in the NCI60 cell line platform [45].
Whereas increasing Efemp1 expression induces
p27Kip1 expression, and vice versa, reducing Efemp1
expression reduces p27Kip1 expression in the investigated
murine cell lines, it is currently unknown whether p27Kip1
is the sole effector directed by Efemp1 to modulate PI3KmTOR inhibitor sensitivity. Since the aim of the current
study was to unbiased define markers for PI3K-mTOR
inhibitor sensitivity in PDAC models, clarification of this
topic awaits further experiments beyond the scope of the
current manuscript.
Although we provide some evidence that Efemp1
and p27Kip1 are also relevant in human PDAC models
to control the sensitivity towards the dual PI3K-mTOR
inhibitor, sufficient validation of both markers depends
on the availability of a large low-passaged human PDAC
cell line platform currently unavailable in our laboratory.
Furthermore, additional in vivo studies, beyond the scope

of the current manuscript, are needed to additional define
the predictive value of Efemp1 and p27Kip1 for PI3KmTOR inhibitor sensitivity in pre-clinical settings.
In conclusion, we have defined the Efemp1-p27Kip1
axis as predictive for the sensitivity of PDAC cells for
the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor Bez235 in a murine preclinical model. These observations might help to better
stratify clinical trials with PI3K-mTOR inhibitors in
PDAC.
