BACKGROUND. Previous prognostic studies in primary myelofibrosis have focused
on risk factors for overall survival and have resulted in the establishment of several prognostic scoring systems. However, to the authors’ knowledge, information
regarding risk factors for leukemic transformation in primary myelofibrosis is
limited.

METHODS. The current retrospective study examined clinical variables at the time
of diagnosis and specific treatment modalities for their effect on leukemic transformation in 311 patients with primary myelofibrosis who were seen at the Mayo

RESULTS. Univariate analysis of parameters at the time of diagnosis revealed a
blood blast percentage 3 (P < .0001), a platelet count <100 3 109/L (P 5 .004),
a monocyte count 1 3 109/L (P 5 .02), the presence of hypercatabolic symptoms (P 5 .03), a low hemoglobin level (P 5 .04), and a high leukocyte count
(P 5 .04). The first 2 parameters were found to maintain their statistical significance during multivariate analysis. Neither leukemia-free nor overall survival was
found to be affected by the presence of <3% peripheral blood blasts or
JAK2V617F mutation. The evaluation of treatment effect on leukemic transformation unexpectedly revealed a significant and independent association with previous therapy with either erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (P 5 .004) or danazol
(P 5 .007), even when the aforementioned prognostic indicators at the time of diagnosis were added as covariates to the multivariate model. In contrast, leukemia-free survival was not found to be affected by a treatment history with
hydroxyurea, thalidomide, or other drugs.

CONCLUSIONS. A peripheral blood blast percentage 3 and/or a platelet count
<100 3 109/L at the time of diagnosis were found to be strong and independent
predictors of leukemic transformation in patients with primary myelofibrosis. The
unexpected association between leukemic transformation and a history of treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or danazol requires validation by
prospective studies. Cancer 2008;112:2726–32.  2008 American Cancer Society.

either in the bone marrow4,6,7,16,17 or splenic tissue.18
The first 4 variables from the above-cited list were
used to construct what to our knowledge are the 2
most widely used prognostic scoring systems for survival in primary myelofibrosis: the Dupriez et al.
(which uses hemoglobin level and leukocyte count)1
and Cervantes et al. (which uses hemoglobin level,
circulating blasts, and constitutional symptoms)5
prognostic scoring systems. However, recent studies
from the Mayo Clinic have underscored the additional negative prognostic relevance of both a platelet count <100 3 109/L and a monocyte count 1 3
109/L19,20 and the incorporation of these 2 variables
into the prognostic scoring system of Dupriez et al.1
has been shown to result in a new ‘‘Mayo’’ prognostic scoring system (which uses hemoglobin level, leukocyte count, platelet count, and monocyte count)
that identifies patients who are most suitable for
‘‘watchful waiting’’ (those at low risk), conventional
or experimental drug therapy (those at intermediate
risk), or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (those at
high risk).4,19,20
In contrast to the above-mentioned activity in
prognostic investigations regarding survival in
patients with primary myelofibrosis, to our knowledge
the association between clinical and laboratory features at the time of the initial diagnosis and the risk of
leukemic transformation (also known as blast phase
primary myelofibrosis)21 has not been well studied. In
what to our knowledge is 1 of the very few studies to
examine that particular issue, 195 patients with primary myelofibrosis were followed for a median of 36
months1; 22 patients developed blast-phase primary
myelofibrosis at a median of 36 months (range, 12136 months), with a 5-year risk of death from leukemic transformation of 16% reported.1 In that particular study, univariate analysis identified a leukocyte
count >30 3 109/L and abnormal karyotype as risk
factors for death from leukemic transformation.1
Because we believe current therapy for blast-phase
primary myelofibrosis is utterly inadequate and does
not alter the associated dismal prognosis (median
survival of approximately 3 months),22,23 it is important to accurately identify high-risk patients and consider experimental drug therapy or allogeneic stem
cell transplantation while they are still in the chronic
phase of their disease. Furthermore, because of a previously reported association between therapeutic
splenectomy in patients with primary myelofibrosis
and leukemic transformation,24 it is equally important, in both high-risk and low-risk patients, to identify and avoid the use of treatment modalities that
might increase the risk of leukemic transformation.
Both these issues, risk factors at diagnosis and the

2727

contribution of specific therapies to the development
of blast-phase primary myelofibrosis, were examined
in the current retrospective study of 311 patients from
a single institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Approval was obtained from the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board before reviewing the medical
records of patients with the diagnosis of primary
myelofibrosis during the period from 1976 through
2006. Clinical and laboratory data, including bone
marrow histology, were rereviewed and the diagnosis
of primary myelofibrosis was confirmed according to
the World Health Organization criteria.25 Leukemic
transformation was considered in the presence of
blast-phase primary myelofibrosis according to criteria by the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment: the presence of
either 20% blasts in the bone marrow or 30% in the
peripheral blood.21
All study patients were required to have documentation of a complete blood count, peripheral blood
blast percentage, and bone marrow examination
obtained at or within 6 months of diagnosis and
before primary myelofibrosis-specific therapy. All
bone marrow examinations were either performed or
the slides reviewed at our institution. Details regarding
the clinical and laboratory presentation at or within 6
months of diagnosis and all primary myelofibrosisspecific therapeutic interventions were abstracted
from the medical records. Hypercatabolic symptoms
were defined by the presence of 1 of the following:
unexplained fever (objectively documented by the
patient to be >37.88C at least on 2 occasions), excessive sweats (requiring a change of clothing) persisting
for >1 month, and weight loss >10% of the baseline
value in the year preceding the initial diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis.5 JAK2V617F mutational status
was established by either allele-specific polymerase
chain reaction or sequencing. Follow-up information
on each study patient was obtained by telephone calls
or letters sent to patients and/or their physicians.
Statistical analysis was performed using StatView
software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). P values were
2-tailed and statistical significance was set at P < .05.
All clinical and laboratory parameters that were evaluated for their effect on leukemia-free survival were
those obtained at the time or within 6 months of the
initial diagnosis. Continuous variables were summarized as medians and ranges. Categoric variables were
described as count and relative frequency (%). The
Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used
to compare continuous variables between categories.

Comparison between categoric variables was performed by chi-square statistics. Variables that were
identified as being significant on univariate analysis
were subjected to multivariate analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the impact of
various clinical and laboratory variables and therapeutic interventions on leukemia-free survival.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for groups
stratified by the presence or absence of independent
risk factors for leukemic transformation and compared using the log-rank test. All survival curves
were coded from the time of the initial diagnosis and
not from the time of referral to the Mayo Clinic.

12% had absolute monocytosis (a monocyte count 1

had a peripheral blood blast percentage 1, and 9%
had a peripheral blood blast percentage 3 (Table 1).
The number of patients with high-risk, intermediaterisk, or low-risk disease according to Dupriez et al.1
was 30 (10%), 94 (30%), and 187 (60%), respectively.
Among 182 and 139 evaluable patients, 74 (41%) and
80 (58%) displayed cytogenetic abnormalities and

(9%) of leukemic transformation were documented at
a median time from the primary myelofibrosis diagnosis to leukemic transformation of 26 months
(range, 0.8-266 months).

RESULTS
A consecutive series of 311 patients with primary
myelofibrosis were studied. Their presenting clinical
and laboratory features are outlined in Table 1. The

either the Mayo19,20 (P 5 .02) or Cervantes et al.5
(P 5 .004) prognostic scoring system (Table 1).
Leukemia-free survival was not found to be affected
by a peripheral blood blast percentage of between 1
and 3 (P 5 .49). On multivariate analysis, significance
was sustained only for a peripheral blood blast percentage of 3 (P 5 .0002) and a platelet count of
<100 3 109/L (P 5 .02) with hazards ratios (HR)
of 5.8 and 2.8 and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
of 2.3 to 14.6 and 1.2 to 6.6, respectively. The presence of JAK2V617F mutation did not appear to
affect leukemia-free survival (P 5 .98). As indicated
earlier, a peripheral blood blast percentage 3% was
found to have the strongest prognostic significance
for leukemic transformation compared with a peripheral blood blast percentage >0% and 1% or
>1% and <3% (Table 2). The 3% cutoff value was
also found to be the most relevant in terms of predicting inferior overall survival (Fig. 1).

Effect of Specific Treatment on Leukemia-free Survival
On univariate analysis, leukemia-free survival was
found to be significantly inferior in patients with a
history of splenectomy (P 5 .01) or treatment with
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents including erythropoietin-a or darbepoetin-a (P 5 .004), danazol
(P 5 .007), or androgens (P 5 .03) (Table 3). Leukemiafree survival did not appear to be affected by a
history of treatment with hydroxyurea (P 5 .17),

the aforementioned prognostic indicators at the time
of diagnosis were added as covariates to the multivariable model.

Combined Value of Risk Factors at Diagnosis for
Leukemia-free Survival in Patients With Primary
Myelofibrosis
Using the 2 aforementioned independent prognostic
factors for leukemia-free survival, obtained at the
time of diagnosis (ie, the presence of peripheral

blood blasts 3% and a platelet count <100 3 109/
L), patients can be categorized into 3 groups with 0,
1, or 2 risk factors for leukemia-free survival. In the
current series of 311 patients, 240 patients (77.2%)
presented with none of the 2 risk factors whereas 60
patients (19.3%) and 11 patients (3.5%) patients presented with either 1 or both risk factors, respectively.
The corresponding frequencies of leukemic transformation were 5.8%, 18.3%, and 18.2% respectively
(P 5 .003). The likelihood of leukemic transformation
in the absence of both risk factors was significantly
less than that noted in the presence of either 1
(P < .0001; HR of 0.18 [95% CI, 0.08-0.41]) or both
(P 5 0.003; HR of 0.10 [95% CI, 0.02-0.46]) risk factors. Accordingly, one can construct leukemia-free
survival curves for patients with no risk factors (ie,
those at low risk) versus those with either 1 or 2 risk
factors (ie, those at high risk). In addition to a significant difference in overall leukemia-free survival
(Fig. 2), the 2 groups (low risk vs high risk) displayed
significantly different incidences of leukemic transformation at 1 year (1% vs 10%; P 5 .002), 3 years
(5% vs 35%; P < .0001), and 5 years (18% vs 65%;
P < .0001) from diagnosis, when considering only the
at-risk population at these different time points (180
patients vs 50 patients at 1 year, 111 patients vs 29
patients at 3 years, and 78 patients vs 20 patients at
5 years).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study represents the
first systematic investigation of prognostic factors for
leukemic transformation in patients with primary
myelofibrosis and identifies peripheral blood blast
blasts 3% and a platelet count <100 3 109/L at the
time of diagnosis as independent risk factors for the
development of blast-phase primary myelofibrosis.
The study also provides risk-adapted estimations of
leukemic transformation risk at 1 year, 3 years, and 5
years after the initial diagnosis. Such information
complements survival-based risk stratification in
identifying patients who warrant special consideration for close monitoring, stem cell transplantation,
or experimental drug therapy.
It is to be noted that both a platelet count <100
3 109/L and the presence of circulating blasts are
also independent predictors of inferior survival in
patients with primary myelofibrosis; the former is
incorporated in the Mayo prognostic scoring system19,20 and the latter in the Cervantes prognostic
scoring systems.5 However, the cutoff blast percentage level used in the Cervantes prognostic scoring
system is 1%, whereas the optimal cutoff value in

FIGURE 2. Leukemia-free survival curves for patients with 0 risk factors
(ie, neither a peripheral blast count 3% nor a platelet count <100 3 109/
L is present) versus those with 1 or 2 risk factors (a peripheral blast count
3% and/or a platelet count <100 3 109/L) among 311 patients with primary myelofibrosis.

the current study was 3% in terms of predicting
both leukemia-free and overall survival. In this
regard, the findings of the current study are consistent with those of a large Japanese study of 336
patients, in which the presence of 3% circulating
blasts was found to be an independent predictor of
inferior survival.3
As illustrated in Figure 2, patients with either 1
of the 2 aforementioned risk factors for leukemic
transformation have a significantly worse outcome
but the additional risk conferred by the presence of
2, as opposed to 1, risk factors could not be accurately assessed because of the small number of
patients with both risk factors (n 5 11). Sample size
and heterogeneity in cytogenetic abnormalities might
also underlie the lack of significance attached to
abnormal karyotype.1 It should be remembered that
the prognostic significance, for survival, of karyotype
in patients with primary myelofibrosis might be
aligned with certain specific lesions rather than the
mere presence or absence of cytogenetic abnormalities.16,17 Conversely, in the current study, there was
not even a hint of an association between the presence of JAK2V617F mutation and leukemic transformation, which is consistent with our previous studies
in that regard26,27 and different from the observations
made by others.28
The most surprising finding in the current study
was the unexpected association between leukemic
transformation and a history of treatment with either
an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent or danazol,
which was not accounted for by the presence of ane-

mia at the time of diagnosis or the aforementioned
risk factors for either inferior survival or leukemic
transformation. Because our retrospective study was
not designed to monitor the development of anemia
or red blood cell transfusion dependency after initial
diagnosis, it is possible that a history of treatment
with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent or danazol
was a surrogate for a biologically more aggressive
disease. However, an association between other
drugs used for anemia (eg, thalidomide) and leukemic transformation was not evident and univariate
analysis-based associations between leukemic transformation and splenectomy or androgen therapy
were not sustained during multivariate analysis.
The association between leukemic transformation
in patients with primary myelofibrosis and the use of
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was particularly intriguing considering the finding that erythropoiesisstimulating agents have recently been implicated in
tumor progression and inferior survival in certain
solid tumors including head and neck,29,30 metastatic
breast,31,32 and nonsmall cell lung33 cancers. The putative mechanism of detrimental effect, in this context, is tumor and endothelial cell expression of
erythropoietin receptors with the respective augmentation of neoplastic growth and tumor-associated
angiogenesis. Such a scenario is also possible in primary myelofibrosis because myeloid progenitors
readily express erythropoietin receptor and bone marrow angiogenesis is considered to be an adverse prognostic factor in primary myelofibrosis.34 Regardless,
the observation from the current retrospective study
must be validated by properly designed prospective
studies before its application to current management.
