ABSTRACT
Statins, such as lovastatin, can induce a cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This
robust antiproliferative activity remains intact in many cancer cells that are deficient
in cell cycle checkpoints and leads to an increased expression of CDK inhibitor proteins
p27Kip1 and p21Cip1. The molecular details of this statin-induced growth arrest remains
unclear. Here we present evidence that lovastatin can induce the degradation of Skp2,
a subunit of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase that targets p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 for proteasomal
destruction.
The statin-induced degradation of Skp2 is cell cycle phase independent and does
not require its well characterised degradation pathway mediated by APC/CCdh1- or
Skp2 autoubiquitination. An N-terminal domain preceding the F-box of Skp2 is both
necessary and sufficient for its statin mediated degradation. The degradation of Skp2
results from statin induced depletion of geranylgeranyl isoprenoid intermediates of
cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of geranylgeranyl-transferase-I also promotes
APC/CCdh1- independent degradation of Skp2, indicating that de-modification of a
geranylgeranylated protein triggers this novel pathway of Skp2 degradation.

INTRODUCTION

7 cells more efficiently than in non-cancerous MCF-10
epithelial cells [5]. In vivo, lovastatin has also been shown
to prevent carcinogenesis in a rat model for liver cancer
[6]. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that statins
can impinge on cancer development at different stages of
progression. Thus statins have the potential to interfere
with the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells
via negative regulation of phospholipase 2 group VII
(PLA2G7) [7]. Interestingly, statins have also been shown
to have an immunomodulatory function in spontaneous
mouse mammary tumours by promoting T cell infiltration
[8]. This activity was shown to lead to reduced formation
of new lesions in a mouse genetic model for tumour
development. Prospective observational studies in humans
revealed a significant reduction in cancer risk (14%-28%)
associated with Statin use [9].
These observations coupled with a well-established
clinical history in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia

Statins are a class of small fungal metabolites
that inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme that
catalyses the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarylCoA (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate [1]. This is a ratelimiting step of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.
For this reason statins have been used extensively for the
treatment of hypercholesterolemia. It has been appreciated
for some time that statins also can induce growth arrest
in several diverse cancer cell lines [2, 3]. Statin induced
apoptosis has also been reported to occur in a subset of
tumour cell types [3]. Importantly, normal cells appear
to be more resistant to statin induced growth arrest and
cytotoxicity. Thus statins have been reported to inhibit
proliferation of karyotipically abnormal embryonic stem
cells but not normal embryonic stem cells [4]. In addition,
lipophilic statins were found to induce cell death in MCFwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have lead to the proposition that statins may be used in
the treatment of cancer. However, conclusive data from
randomised control trials for statin use and cancer risk
are currently lacking. In general statin treatment seems to
be beneficial for the treatment of certain types of cancer
but not for others [10]. Statins also target a broad range
of cellular processes which may confound their efficacy
[11]. Therefore a better understanding of the molecular
pathways responsible for their ability to inhibit cell
proliferation seems important.
Statins can lead to the induction of the cyclin
dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) p27Kip1 and p21Cip1,
leading to decreased cyclin dependent kinase activity
and subsequent arrest cell cycle arrest in G1 phase [1214]. The induction of p27 by lovastatin is regulated
post-transcriptionally [15]. During normal cell cycle
progression, p27Kip1 is ubiquitinated in late G1 phase
by the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase and thereby targeted for
proteasomal degradation [16-19]. SCFSkp2 is also an
ubiquitin ligase for p21Cip1 [20, 21]. It has proposed that
lovastatin can up regulate p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 by directly
inhibiting the 26S proteasome [22]. The presence of
a lactone moiety in the closed ring prodrug form of
lovastatin that can directly inhibit the chymotrypsin like
catalytic activity of the proteasome has been posited to
account for this G1 arresting activity [22, 23]. However
other reports demonstrate that neither the prodrug nor the
active dihydroxy acid form of lovastatin can inhibit the
proteasome in SSC25, HeLa or 293T cells [24]. Indeed,
one study suggests that the closed ring form can mildly
stimulate the chymotrypsin like activity of purified bovine
20S proteasomes [25] .
We previously observed that the level of the Skp2
protein, a E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit, regulating p27
stability during the G1/S transition is specifically reduced
significantly following lovastatin-induced cell cycle
arrest, but not a cell cycle arrest induced by nocodazole
or thymidine [26]. Skp2 is an oncogene that has been
shown to be independent marker for poor prognosis in
several types of human cancer [27-29]. We wondered
if the reduced Skp2 levels were causing the elevated
levels of p27 in lovastatin treated cells and therefore
driving cessation of proliferation. This could reconcile
the contradictory reports on the effects of lovastatin
on proteasome activity; rather than a general blockade
of proteasome activity, we speculated that by down
regulating Skp2, lovastatin might prevent the proteasomal
degradation of p27 and p21, whilst not affecting
proteasomal turnover in general.
Here we show that Skp2 is robustly and specifically
down regulated in response to lovastatin treatment
and that this precedes the p27 and p21 accumulation.
Downregulation of Skp2 is cell cycle phase independent
and therefore not a consequence of the cell cycle arrest in
G1 phase. Furthermore, we establish that destabilisation
of the protein is responsible for the downregulation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Skp2. Interestingly, the mechanism for degrading
Skp2 is distinct from the previously reported Cdh1dependent degradation or auto-ubiquitination [30-32],
thus representing a novel pathway of Skp2 degradation.
Lovastatin triggers this pathway by preventing the
geranyl-geranylation of an as yet unknown protein, since
geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate rescues the lovastatin arrest
and inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase I also induces
downregulation of Skp2. An N-terminal domain in Skp2
is required and sufficient to permit its downregulation by
lovastatin and inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferases.

RESULTS
Lovastatin induces downregulation of the Skp2
protein, but does not alter Skp2 mRNA level
As reported previously, treatment of cells with
lovastatin leads to increased levels of p21 and p27 and
an accumulation of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle
[12-14, 26, 33] (Fig. 1A, C). This is associated with
significantly reduced Skp2 protein level, whereas the
INK4 inhibitors p15 and p16, cyclins A and E as well as
CDK level remain mostly unaltered (Fig. 1A). Since the
level of Skp2 protein is normally low during early and mid
G1 phase, the reduced amount of Skp2 protein following
lovastatin treatment might be a consequence of the cell
cycle arrest rather than its cause. Skp2 transcription and
protein levels are increased in S-phase [32, 34]. To rule
out a cell cycle positional effect, we first arrested HeLa
cells in S-phase and subsequently treated the S-phase
arrested cells with lovastatin. Lovastatin caused a clear
decline in the Skp2 protein level even in S-phase arrested
cells, where Skp2 usually is relatively stable (Fig. 1A,
+ thymidine), demonstrating that the reduction of Skp2
occurs independently of the G1 arrest caused by lovastatin.
p21 and p27 did not accumulate in S-phase arrested cells,
probably because Skp2 levels remain generally elevated
and these remaining levels of Skp2 may be sufficient to
promote p21 and p27 degradation. In fact, even though
Skp2 levels in lovastatin-treated S-phase cells were
significantly reduced, they remain similar to those of
proliferating (untreated) cells. Thus the decrease in Skp2
protein following lovastatin treatment does not merely
reflect the cell cycle position, but suggests a cell cycle
independent direct pathway regulating Skp2 abundance
upon lovastatin addition. This could cause the stabilisation
of p27 and p21 and the subsequent cell cycle arrest.
Consistent with this model, we observed that
the lovastatin-induced decrease in Skp2 precedes the
accumulation of p27 (Fig. 1B,C). To directly investigate
the hypothesis that Skp2 decline is driving accumulation
of p27 and subsequent inhibition of proliferation,
we generated virally transduced cell lines stably

overexpressing the Skp2 cDNA. As reported previously,
Skp2 overexpression is able to induce degradation of p27
[18, 26]. p27 is known to be phosphorylated on threonine
residue 187 in lovastatin-arrested cells [18, 26], generating
the phosphodegron which is a prerequisite for its SCFinitiated degradation. Overexpression of Skp2 reduced
p27 levels in stably transduced cells in the presence and
absence of lovastatin. Importantly, Skp2 overexpression
could attenuate the lovastatin-induced accumulation
of the CDK inhibitors with p27 level similar to those
of proliferating cells (Fig. 1D). This corresponded with
a decreased number of cells in G1-phase and increased
number of cells in S-phase as revealed by FACS analysis
(Fig. 1D), consistent with the hypothesis that the decline
of Skp2 promotes the accumulation of p21 and p27 in
lovastatin arrested cells. As a main substrate of Skp2 is the
CDK inhibitor p27 [19], we investigated if cells lacking
p27 expression are less sensitive to lovastatin-induced
cell cycle arrest. Immortalised p27-/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts were incubated with lovastatin for 24 hrs
and compared to wt MEFs. Untreated p27-/- MEFs are
characterised by reduced cells in G1 phase and increased
cells in S-phase (Fig. 1E). Upon incubation in lovastatin,
less p27-/- cells accumulated in G1 phase (73% vs. 95%)
and more cells remained in S-phase (19% of p27-/compared to 2% of wt MEFs). These data further support
our hypothesis that the Skp2-p27 axis plays an important
role in the lovastatin-induced cell cycle arrest.
Of note, statins are also able to induce a decline
of overexpressed Skp2. This suggests that lovastatin
regulates Skp2 levels independently of transcription
from the endogenous Skp2 gene, since overexpression
was achieved by viral transduction of a Skp2 cDNA
expressed under the control of the phosphoglycerate
kinase (PGK) promoter. To investigate if the reduction of

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Skp2 is transcriptionally regulated or due to altered Skp2
mRNA stability, we compared Skp2 mRNA levels in
lovastatin-arrested cells and untreated cells. In contrast to
the protein level, no significant reduction of Skp2 mRNA
was observed in asynchronous cells as well as in S-phase
arrested cells (Fig. 1F). This excludes transcriptional
mechanisms and the regulation of Skp2 mRNA stability
as a cause of the Skp2 elimination.

Lovastatin induces degradation of Skp2 which is
independent of APC/CCdh1
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the
decrease in Skp2 levels is based on a post-transcriptional
mechanism. The Skp2 protein itself is known to undergo
ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. In order to
investigate if lovastatin might induce the degradation of
the Skp2 protein, we treated cells with the cell permeable
reversible proteasome inhibitor MG132 (carbobenzoxyLeu-Leu-leucinal) and lovastatin and monitored the Skp2
decline. The peptide aldehyde MG132 prevents downregulation of Skp2 following lovastatin treatment (Fig.
2A). This demonstrates that inhibition of proteolysis
restores Skp2 expression, suggesting that lovastatin
initiates the degradation of the protein. As expected,
MG132 also induced stabilisation of p21 and p27, which
are substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Fig.
2A).
The stability of Skp2 is cell cycle regulated.
Another ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, APC/CCdh1 initiates
its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. We
used mouse embryonic knockout fibroblasts for the APC
subunit Cdh1 to determine if Skp2 degradation induced
by lovastatin was dependent on the APC/CCdh1 ubiquitin

ligase. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, lovastatin treatment
results in a decrease in Skp2 levels even in the absence
of Cdh1. This was also observed in cells in which Cdh1
can be inducibly knocked down by doxycycline (Fig.
2C). Since we can also exclude autoubiquitination as a
mechanism triggering the Skp2 elimination induced by
statins (see below), a novel pathway is responsible for the
statin-induced degradation of Skp2.

Skp2 downregulation

is

dependent

of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl
pyrophosphate (FPP) to prevent Skp2 down-regulation
following lovastatin treatment. We found that GGPP
could completely prevent the Skp2 decrease as well as the
p27 and p21 increase, whereas FPP did not significantly
alter the ability of lovastatin to down regulate Skp2 and
increase p21 and p27 (Fig. 3A). As FPP is a precursor
of GGPP, one might expect that FPP should also rescue
the Lovastatin effect. However, in order to produce a 20
carbon geranylgeranylpyrophosphate from a 15 carbon
FPP precursor, it requires a the 5 carbon isopentenyl
pyrophosphate. As lovastatin blocks the de novo synthesis
of isopentyl pyrophosphate, which is synthesized from
mevalonic acid, its depletion should inhibit the GGPP
synthesis from FPP.
We speculated that inhibition of protein
geranylgeranylation might cause the lovastatin induced
Skp2 degradation. To investigate if blockade of protein
geranylgeranylation might induce Skp2 degradation,
we asked if inhibitors of geranylgeranylation could
mimic the effects of lovastatin on Skp2. Inhibition

number of proteins including oncogenic GTPases such
as Ras and Rho proteins [35]. Furthermore, a number of
studies have shown that inhibitors of isoprenylation can
inhibit cell proliferation. We therefore tested the ability

molecule inhibitor GGTI-298 lead to a dramatic decline
in Skp2 levels and to an increase of p21 and p27 (Fig.
3B). In contrast, an inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, FTI277, was not able to induce Skp2 down-regulation (Fig.
3B). These data indicate that lack of geranylgeranylation
is responsible for the statin-induced Skp2 decline. Skp2
declined rapidly in response to GGTI-298 treatment
with a significant decline occurring already at 6 hours of
treatment (Fig. 3C). p27 accumulation commences after
12 hours and is clearly apparent after 24 hours. Thus the
sequential order of Skp2 decline and p27 accumulation
is conserved between GGTI-298 and lovastatin treatment.
The Skp2 decline following GGTI-298 treatment is also
prevented by MG132 treatment (Fig. 3D), supporting
our model that lovastatin induces Skp2 degradation by
inhibiting protein geranylgeranylation. As for lovastatin,
knockout of p27 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts also
attenuated G1 accumulation and inhibition of cell
proliferation (Fig. 3E). Using the Cdh1-/- MEFs, we
found that the GGTI-298 induced Skp2 decline (like that
of lovastatin) still occurs in the absence of Cdh1 (Fig.
3F). Using Nocodazole treatment preceding GGTI-298
incubation we could also demonstrate that GGTI-298 can
induce proteolytic destruction of Skp2 in G2/M arrested
cells (Fig. 3G), confirming that this degradation pathway
is independent from a G1 arrest and active in different
phases of the cell cycle. Together, these data indicate that
lovastatin and GGTI-298 promote the specific degradation
of Skp2 and that this enables p27 to accumulate. The
inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferases with GGTI298 uses a highly conserved and robust mechanism to
downregulate Skp2, as we observed this downregulation
in all human and murine cell lines tested (Fig. 4 A,B).

GGTI-298 or lovastatin induced degradation. Structural
[36] and functional [16, 18, 37] analysis of Skp2 has
identified at least three separate domains: A N-terminal
regulatory domain, the F-box domain required for
interaction with the core SCF subunit Skp1 [38] and a
C-terminal leucine-rich repeat region forming a concave
surface that interacts with phosphorylated substrate
proteins [36, 37, 39]. We generated a Skp2 mutant lacking
the internal F-box domain [16], a deletion mutant of the
N-terminal domain, (lacking amino acids 1-94: Skp2
∆ NT), and a deletion mutant that lacks the C-terminal
LRR domain (Skp2 ∆ CT) (Fig. 5A). These mutants were
transfected into HeLa cells, which were then subsequently
treated with GGTI-298 or lovastatin. The F-box of Skp2
is essential for its incorporation into the SCF complex
[38]. A mutant lacking this domain was still regulated by
GGTI-298 and lovastatin, indicating that incorporation of
Skp2 into an SCF is not a prerequisite for its lovastatin or
GGTI-298 induced degradation (Fig. 5B). Since the F-box
domain is also required for the auto-ubiquitination of
Skp2 by the bound SCF core complex [30], and since p27
inhibits Skp2 auto-ubiquitination in vivo [40], it is unlikely
that auto-ubiquitination is contributing to the lovastatin or
GGTI-298 induced elimination of Skp2.
The mutant lacking the C-terminal domain was
down regulated to a similar extent as the wt protein
following GGTI-298 or lovastatin addition (Fig. 5B). In
contrast, the mutant lacking the first 94 amino acids is
significantly stabilised (Fig. 5B), even though it contains
the F-box domain.
These data suggested that an important determinant
for lovastatin/GGTI-298 mediated Skp2 destabilisation
resides in the N-terminus of the molecule. We therefore
investigated if this N-terminal region might be sufficient to
initiate degradation triggered by GGTI-298 or lovastatin.
We fused this N-terminal domain fragment to enhanced
YFP (eYFP) (Fig. 5A). The fusion protein, Skp2 ∆ NT
and eYFP were expressed in HeLa cells. The levels of YFP
alone or Skp2 lacking its N-terminus (Skp2 ∆ NT) are not
appreciably reduced by either lovastatin or GGTI-298
treatment. However, the first 94 amino acids of Skp2 are
sufficient to trigger degradation of the fusion protein upon
inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase I and, to a lesser

the down-regulation
We next aimed to identify a domain responsible
for the statin-mediated degradation of Skp2. To identify
sequence elements of Skp2 required for its downregulation
by lovastatin or GGTI-298, we analysed several point
mutants and deletion mutants for their ability to undergo

extent by lovastatin (Fig. 5C). This is likely a consequence
of the faster depletion of the geranylgeranylation by
GGTI-298 compared to lovastatin (see above). Thus, the
N-terminal region of Skp2 can function as a transferable
degron in the context of GGTI-298 and lovastatin
mediated Skp2 down-regulation. As this domain lacks
the F-box domain and the C-terminus of Skp2, the
statin-induced degradation of Skp2 does not require its
incorporation into an SCF complex and therefore does not
require auto-ubiquitination.

prodrug to its open ring form [42].
We observed no evidence that general and off target
inhibition of the proteasome activity contributes to the
lovastatin mediated G1 arrest. Our data rather suggest
that the inhibition of p27 and p21 degradation is substrate
specific and a consequence of the ability of lovastatin to
deplete geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. This depletion
triggers a novel pathway that stabilises the CDK inhibitors
p21 and p27 by degradation of the ubiquitin ligase subunit
Skp2. Importantly, ubiquitin-mediated degradation
of p27 and p21 could be partially restored by ectopic
expression of Skp2 in the presence of lovastatin (Fig.
1D), clearly demonstrating that the proteasome remains
active. Similarly, deletion of the central Skp2 substrate
p27 attenuated the lovastatin-induced cell cycle arrest,
confirming the important role of the Skp2/p27 axis in this
arrest.
Interestingly, the geranylgeranylation-dependent
degradation of Skp2 is functional in different cell lines (all
of those that we tested) from human or mouse, reflecting
the wide-ranging cell cycle arresting activity of lovastatin
previously observed. In mouse models for tumorigenesis,
it has been shown that geranylgeranyl-transferase-I
ablation reduces tumour formation and improves survival
[43], suggesting that geranylgeranylated proteins could
also be important targets of lovastatin’s anti-tumour
activity. Our observation that GGPP can rescue lovastatin
induced Skp2 down-regulation and that inhibition of
geranylgeranyl-transferase-I with GGTI-298 induces
Skp2 downregulation suggests that a geranylgeranylated
protein regulates Skp2 stability, whose function can be
activated by inhibition of geranylgeranylation, leading to
Skp2 degradation. It is tempting to speculate that this is
not only a drug-specific pathway.
Geranylgeranylated Rho family GTPases,
including RhoA and Rac1 have been shown to regulate
G1 progression. Previous studies have suggested that
geranylgeranylated Rho GTPases can destabilize
p27 [44, 45] or that RhoA acts as positive regulator
of cyclin E/CDK2 kinase activity [46]. Since Cyclin

DISCUSSION
Here we describe that the lovastatin-induced cell
cycle arrest is caused by the degradation of Skp2 induced
by the depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Skp2
is a subunit of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase and its statin
mediated decline leads to an accumulation of the CDK
inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 and cell cycle arrest in G1
phase. The degradation of Skp2 triggered by statins is
not a consequence of auto-ubiquitination or APC/CCdh1mediated degradation. Instead it is mediated by a novel
pathway initiating Skp2 degradation.
Some previous studies have suggested that the
accumulation of p21 and p27 may result from direct
inhibition of the proteasome by lovastatin. For example, it
was observed that the inactive prodrug form of lovastatin
could inhibit the proteasome [22]. Mevalonate, the product
of the HMG-CoA reductase reaction, could activate
proteasomal activity [41], explaining why mevalonic acid
releases cells from the lovastatin arrest. But a later study
found no evidence that the prodrug inhibits proteasomal
activity [24]. Yet a further study found that the closed ring
beta-lactone form of lovastatin induced the disappearance
of p27. While this closed ring form was cytotoxic, no
evidence of cytostatic activity could be found [25]. This
study reported in contrast that mevalonate could inhibit the
trypsin like activity of the proteasome. These experiments
might have been complicated by the fact that serum is a
potential source of carboxyesterases that can process the

E /CDK2 phosphorylates p27 on T187 and this
phosphorylation is required for its degradation, blocking
of geranylgeranylation could inhibit p27 degradation [45,
47]. However, p27 is phosphorylated on threonine 187
in the presence of lovastatin [26] and overexpression of
Skp2 can rescue p27 degradation in lovastatin-arrested
cells. Other studies have suggested that the GTPase
Rac1 can positively regulate Skp2 levels [48]. Inhibition

of the geranylgeranylation of these small GTPases
might therefore cause the decline of Skp2. However,
we could not find any evidence that these GTPases or
the Rho downstream kinase ROCK are involved in
the statin-induced Skp2 degradation: the lovastatin/

to the overexpression of wt or constitutively active

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ROCK overexpression (JV, AM and LH, unpublished
observations). In addition, lovastatin-induced Skp2
degradation was also not changed in the presence of cell
permeable C3 toxin which inactivates RhoA, B and C
[49].
We therefore speculate that an as yet unidentified
geranylgeranylated protein is responsible for the Skp2
degradation initiated by lovastatin. However molecular
details of this novel Skp2 degradation pathway remain to
be elucidated in the future. Importantly, this novel pathway
does not involve known mechanisms of Skp2 ubiquitinmediated proteasomal degradation: The ubiquitin ligase
APC/CCdh1 is necessary and sufficient for Skp2 degradation
in early G1 phase [31, 32]. We can exclude involvement
of APC/CCdh1 in statin-induced p27 degradation because
lovastatin induced turnover of Skp2 also occurs in
S-phase arrested cells, in which APC/CCdh1 is inactive
[50], and because lovastatin and GGTI-298 can induce
the degradation of Skp2 in cells lacking the Cdh1 protein.
In serum-deprived cells an auto-ubiquitination
mechanism regulates Skp2 stability [30, 40]. This
mechanism depends on Skp2 incorporation into an SCF
complex. Since we observe efficient turnover of a Skp2
mutant lacking the F-box required for the incorporation
into an SCF complex and which even functions as a
dominant negative protein by stabilising p27 [16], we
can exclude auto-ubiquitination as a mechanism for the
lovastatin/GGTI-298 induced Skp2 degradation.
We therefore conclude that lovastatin activates
a novel and as yet uncharacterised pathway of Skp2
degradation. It will be interesting to determine if
this pathway is only activated by drugs inhibiting
geranylgeranylation, or if alternative physiological
mechanisms exist in normal cells that use this pathway to
induce CDK inhibitors and cell cycle arrest.
The discovery of a novel degradation pathway
for Skp2 induced by statins opens up the exiting
possibility that this pathway may be targeted in cancer
therapy. Whilst statins have shown potential in cancer
prevention, their use as a therapy may be hampered by
their pleiotropic effects and tendency to accumulate in the
liver. Given that Skp2 overexpression is associated with
increased malignancy and poor prognosis in several types
of human cancer, the future elucidation of this conserved
and robust antiproliferative pathway responsible for the
elimination of the Skp2 may permit the identification of
novel therapeutics that could be more specific and lack the
side effects of statins.

Reagents
Lovastatin (MERCK #L-154, Alfa Aesar # H52792),
MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich #M7479), Thymidine (SigmaAldrich #T9250), GGPP (Sigma-Aldrich #G6025), FPP
(Sigma-Aldrich #F6892), GGTI-298 (Sigma-Aldrich
#G5169). FTI-277 (Sigma-Aldrich #F9803), BrdU
(Sigma-Aldrich #B9285), propidium iodine (PI) (SigmaAldrich #81845). Nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich # M1404).
Lovastatin was obtained in the form of an inactive betalactone that was activated according to the following
protocol: 208mg of lovastatin was dissolved in 5ml
Ethanol and then supplemented with 7.5 ml 0.1M NaOH.
The solution was incubated at 50oC for 2 hours after which
it was allowed to cool to room temperature. Finally the pH
was adjusted to 7.2 after with 1M HCl. Solvent control
was prepared as above but with the omission of lovastatin.

Cell culture, transfections and lovastatin, GGTI298, thymidine and Nocodazole treatments
The following cell lines were used in this study:
Cdh1-/- MEFs and U2OS cells in which Cdh1 knockdown
can be induced by tetracycline (Utsh2 cells) have been
described previously [51]. Cells were cultured at 37 °C
with 5% CO2 in DMEM (HeLa S3, HeLa, Cdh1-/- MEFs,
Cdh1+/+ MEFs, NIH 3T3, p27-/- MEFs, p27+/+ MEFs, U20S
and HRT-18) or RPMI (LNCAP, K562, WM35 and U937)
medium containing 10% FCS. Transient transfection
experiments were conducted using Effectene® (Qiagen)
transfection reagent according to the manufacturers
instructions. Lovastatin was added to cells to at final
concentration of 40 µM unless otherwise indicated.
Treatments were carried out for the times indicated in the
figure legends. GGTI-298 was similarly added to cells
at a final concentration of 20 or 10 µM as indicated and
incubated for the times indicated in the figure legends.
FTI-277 was used at a concentration of 20µM for 36
hours. Mg132 was added together with lovastatin for
18 hours at a final concentration of 10µM. Thymidine
(Sigma) was added to cells at a final concentration of
2mM. Nocodazole (Sigma) was added to cells at a final
concentration of 50ng/ml

Western blotting analysis
Cells were lysed in SDS buffer containing DTT,
sonicated and incubated at 95 °C for 5 minutes. Proteins
were loaded onto 13% SDS gels and resolved after which
they were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore)
by western blotting. Bands were visualised by the ECL

method (Fig. 1A, B, C, D, E; 2A, 3A-E, 4 and 5B, C) or
using the Odyssey system (Licor) (Fig. 2B, C and 3F).

(no tag) GATEWAY® and deltaT-FLAG-DEST (NT flag
tag) GATEWAY® [53] to generate vectors suitable for
mammalian expression. Skp2 CT and NT domain mutants
were generated as described above but using primer
combinations in the initial step to amplify specific domains
of Skp2. To generate Skp2 lacking the first 94 amino acids,
a forward primer was used that commences at nucleotide
282 in combination with a reverse primer for the full
length cDNA. In contrast to generate the CT delta mutant,
the full length forward primer was used together with a
reverse primer starting at nucleotide 465. To generate a
variant of Skp2 lacking the F-box domain we used the
approach described by Carrano et al. [16]. Thus a DNA
fragment of pDON207 Skp2 corresponding to nucleotides
301-946 was removed by digesting with BSpE1 and Xba1.
Then a PCR fragment containing nucleotides 420-946 and
flanked by BSPe1 (5’) and Xba1 (3’) sites respectively
was ligated into the cut vector generated a mutant lacking
nucleotides 301-419, which correspond to the F-box
region of the Skp2 protein.
To generate a Skp2 with a C-terminal eYFP fusion
to PCR reactions were performed to amplify Skp2 with a
5’ attB1 site and a 3’ Spe1 restriction site and to amplify
eYFP with a 5’ Spe1 site and a 3’ attB2. After Spe1
digestion of the resulting PCR products, a ligation was
performed to generate Skp2 fused to eYFP with flanking
attB1 and attB2 sites. This was used in a BP reaction and
transferred into a Delta T – Flag pDEST for mammalian
expression.

Generation of a Skp2 overexpressing HeLa cell
line
The lentiviral Skp2 expression construct was cloned
by recombining the human Skp2-cDNA (a generous gift
of Wilhelm Krek) into the vector U509 (pHR-PGKdest-bGH-polyA-SFFV-eGFP-rfa_verB generated by
C. Ploner) using the Gateway® cloning technology
(Life Technologies). Cells exhibiting stable Skp2
overexpression can be identified by their concomitant
expression of GFP from the second promoter.
HeLa cells were transduced with lentiviral particles
containing Skp2 according to the procedure previously
described [52].

Generation of of pHR-PGK-bGH-pA-SFFV-eGFP
(U509)
pHR-PGK-bGH-polyA-SFFV-eGFP was generated
by multicloning strategy using pHR-SIN-CSGW (kindly
provided by Mary Collins, London, UK) as starting vector.
pHR-PGK-SFFV-eGFP was made by amplifying the PGKpromoter from pHR-frt-PGK-PURO-frt-SFFV-eGFP
(kindly provided by S. Geley, Innsbruck, Austria) using
the oligonucleotides 5-’tatagaattctaccgggtaggggaggc-3’
(sense) and 5’-TATAGAATTCCATATGGTTTAAACAC
GCGTTACGTAGTCGAAAGGCCCGGAGATG-3’
(antisense). The EcoRI digested PCR product was
subcloned into the EcoRI site of pHR-SIN-CSGW, thereby
also inserting a multiple cloning site (SnaBI-MluI-PmeINdeI) downstream of the PGK-promoter. In a second step,
the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence
(bGH-pA) was PCR amplified using the oligonucleotides
5’-tataacgcgtctagagctcgctgatcagcctc-3’ (sense) and
5’-TATACATATGGATCTCGAGCCCCAGCTGG-3’
(antisense) and pHR-frt-PGK-Puro-frt-SFFV-eGFP as
template. The MluI/NdeI digested PCR product was
inserted into the MluI/NdeI site of pHR-PGK-SFFVeGFP generating pHR-PGK-bGH-polyA-SFFV-eGFP.
Finally this vector was rendered GATEWAY-compatible
by inserting a DEST – cassette (RfA, Invitrogen, Vienna,
Austria) into the SnaBI site downstream of the PGKpromoter.

Northern blotting
Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cell pellets
using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA was then
subjected to electrophoretic separation using a 1% (wt/
vol) agarose-formaldehyde (0.75% v/v) gel after which it
was transferred to a positively charged Hybond membrane
(GE healthcare). The membrane was UV irradiated in
order to fix the RNA. 32P-labeled DNA probes for Skp2
and GAPDH were prepared using the Random primer
DNA labeling system (Invitrogen) using restriction digest
fragments of Skp2 and GAPDH cDNA. Hybridization was
performed by incubating the membrane in ULTRAhyb®
Ultrasensitive Hybridization Buffer (Ambion) containing
the probe at 42 °C for 16 hours. After washing bands
were visualized by autoradiography and quantification
performed by phosphorimaging analysis.

Plasmids and primers

Antibodies

The polymerase chain reaction was used to generate
Skp2 with flanking AttB1 and AttB2. This PCR product
was used in a gateway BP reaction with pDON207
GATEWAY® to generate a Skp2 entry clone. This was
subsequently used in a LR reaction with delta T pDEST

Antibodies. The following antibodies were used
in this study. Skp2 (Rabbit polyclonal H-435, Santa
