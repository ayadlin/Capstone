ABSTRACT
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine tumor with a very poor
prognosis. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), an oncogenic kinase, has previously been
found to be upregulated in various cancers. However, the role of the SphK1 in ACC
has not been investigated. In this study, SphK1 mRNA and protein expression levels
as well as clinicopathological significance were evaluated in ACC samples. In vitro
siRNA knockdown of SphK1 in two ACC cell lines (H295R and SW13) was used to
determine its effect on cellular proliferation and invasion. In addition, we further
evaluated the effect of SphK1 antagonist fingolimod (FTY720) in ACC in vitro and
in vivo, as a single agent or in combination with mitotane, and attempted to explore
its anticarcinogenic mechanisms. Our results show a significant over-expression of
SphK1 mRNA and protein expression in the carcinomas compared with adenomas
(P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Functionally, konckdown of SphK1 gene expression
in ACC cell lines significantly decreased cell proliferation and invasion. FTY720 could
result in a decreased cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, and the combination
of mitotane and FTY720 resulted in a greater anti-proliferative effect over single agent
treatment in SW13 cells. Furthermore, FTY720 could markedly inhibit tumor growth in
ACC xenografts. SphK1 expression is functionally associated to cellular proliferation,
apoptosis, invasion and mitotane sensitivity of ACC. Our data suggest that SphK1
might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ACC.

INTRODUCTION

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), the rate-limiting
enzyme of sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) synthesis,
closely regulates the ceramide/sphingosine-S1P rheostat
[4]. S1P is a bioactive lipid with oncogenic functions
that promoting tumor cell growth and invasion. SphK1
has received increased attention during the past years
[5–6]. SphK1 is overexpressed in various cancers, and the
upregulation of SphK1 is associated with poor prognosis
in many types of human cancers. Consistently, interference
with SphK1 activity by dominant-negative mutants or
competitive inhibitors, as well as inhibition of S1P by
mAbs or S1P receptors antagonists, could significantly
reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion, and
increased apoptosis in some cancer cell lines [7–8].

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare but highly
aggressive endocrine malignancy with a 5-year overall
survival of around 40% [1–2]. Therapeutic options for
these patients are scarce, radical surgery resection remains
the only potentially curative option for ACC until recently;
however, patients often present with advanced localized
invasion or initially distant metastases, limiting the
opportunity for surgical resection. Despite the combination
of cytotoxic drug and mitotane, the overall prognosis is
still very poor in cases of advanced ACC [3]. Thus, there
is still a critical need for the development of new treatment
strategies for patients with ACC.

Knockdown of Sphk1 suppresses cell
proliferation and invasion in ACC cell lines

Moreover, recent studies showed that SphK1 may
be involved in resistance to both chemotherapeutics and
targeted agents, suggesting that inhibitors of SphK1
in combination with chemotherapeutic treatments can
synergistically act to induce tumor cell death [9–10].
However, no data are currently available on the efficacy of
inhibitors of SphK1 in ACC, and the role of SphK1 in ACC
progression remains unknown. In this study, we report
for the first time characterization of SphK1 expression
in human ACC tissues and their correlation with
clinicopathologic factors. In addition, we further evaluated
the effects of anti-SphK1 therapies [anti-SphK1-based
small interfering RNA (siRNA) and pharmacologic
inhibitior FTY720] in ACC cell lines, as a single agent or
in combination with mitotane, and attempted to explore its
anticarcinogenic mechanisms.

To confirm whether SphK1 regulates cell proliferation
in ACC, we using siRNA to knockdown SphK1 expression
in the two adrenal cancer cell lines, SW13 and H295R.
Depletion of SphK1 by siRNA was verified at both RNA
and protein levels (Figure 2A and 2B). Moreover, the
enzymatic activities of SphK1 in SphK1-knocked down
ACC cells were significantly decreased as compared with
control (Figure 2C). MTT assay was performed to examine
the effect of SphK1 on SW13 and H295R cells proliferation.
As shown in Figure 2D and 2E, the results revealed that
Sphk1-siRNA-transfected cells showed a significantly
lower proliferation rate compared with the control groups,
suggesting that SphK1 is involved in enhancing cell
proliferation and might be associated with the transformed
phenotype of ACC cells. To explore the effect of SphK1 on
tumor metastasis, cellular invasiveness was analyzed by
transwell assays, respectively. We found that knockdown of
Sphk1 inhibited cell invasive ability in H295R and SW13
cells, suggesting that overexpression of Sphk1 in ACC could
promote metastasis in vitro (Figure 3A and 3B).

RESULTS
Upregulation of SphK1 expression in ACC
Tumor characteristics and clinical features of 46
patients were summarized in Table 1. To determine the
clinical and functional relevance of SphK1 in ACC, we
initially assess the expression of SphK1 by western blot
analysis and quantitative RT-PCR assay in 10 ACC and
10 ACA freshly frozen tissue samples. Our results showed
that SphK1 was significantly upregulated at both mRNA
and protein levels in ACC samples when compared with
ACA samples (P < 0.001; Figure 1A and 1B). Then, we
examined SphK1 protein expression in 24 ACC and 22
ACA pathology specimens using immunohistochemical
staining. Representative photomicrographs of SphK1
immunostaining are shown in Figure 1C. We observed
that 79.17% (16/24) of the cancer tissue samples showed
high SphK1 expression, however, only 18.18% (4/22)
of the benign group showed high SphK1 expression, the
difference of SphK1 expression between ACAs and ACCs
was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Immunoreactivity
for SphK1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of
cancer cells, which is consistent with previous studies on
SphK1 expression in other types of cancer.
Moreover, SphK1 expression strongly correlated
with ENSAT 3–4 (P = 0.023) and tumor size (P = 0.001),
however, the expression level of SphK1 did not differ
significantly by age, gender, and side (Table 2). As shown
in Figure 1D, the length of survival time was significantly
different between patients with low and high SphK1
expression (P = 0.03), with the low SphK1 group having
a longer overall survival time. Our data revealed that
overexpression of SphK1 may play a biological role in ACC.

Sphingosine analogue FTY720 inhibits
adrenocortical cancer cells proliferation via
PI3K/Akt pathway
FTY720 is a sphingosine analogue and was
previously shown to inhibit enzymatic activity of
recombinant SphK1 [11]. H295R and SW13 cells were
treated with 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 μM of FTY720 for 24, 48 or 72
hrs, respectively. The results of MTT assay showed that
FTY720 induced a dose and time-dependent decrease of
cell viability in these two cell lines (Figure 3C and 3D),
with IC50 values of 6.09 μM and 5.18 μM in SW13 and
H295R cells at 48 h of treatment, respectively. FTY720 at
a concentration of 10 μM could induce a rapid inhibition
of SphK1 enzymatic activity in SW13 and H295R cells
(−36 ± 3% and −42 ± 5% in SW13 and H295R cells,
respectively, at 6 hours; Figure 3E and 3F).
To explore the mechanisms underlying the antitumor
effects of FTY720, we investigated the effect of FTY720
on the activities of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling, which
play an important role in cell proliferation and survival in
cancer [12–13]. When the H295R and SW13 cells were
treated with 2.5, 5, 10 μM of FTY720 for 48 h, and the
results of western blot revealed that FTY720 significantly
reduced the levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-ERK,
indicating that FTY720 specifically attenuated the PI3K/
AKT and MAPK signaling pathways (Figure 4A and 4B).

FTY720 induces apoptosis in ACC cells by
inhibition of SphK1

As expected by the known profiles of mitotaneresponsiveness of the two cell lines, mitotane determined
a cytotoxic effect in H295R cells with a IC50 value of
18.8 μM (at 48 h of treatment), however, the IC50 value
in SW13 cells is more than 50 μM (at 48 h of treatment)
(Figure 4C and 4D). The combination of mitotane and
FTY720 showed a significant synergistic anti-proliferative
effect in SW13 cells (CI = 0.90 ± 0.08) that potentiated the
cytotoxic effect observed by using FTY720 alone, but not
in H295R cells.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Annexin V and PI staining results showed that
with the increase of FTY720 concentration after 24 h,
both in H295R and SW13 cells, the number of apoptotic
cells increased obviously (P < 0.01; Figure 5A and 5B).
However, Early and late apoptotic cell ratios were not
modified by mitotane treatment neither in H295R nor
in SW13 cells (P > 0.05, Figure 5C). Moreover, the

combination of FTY720 and mitotane had a significant
influence on the apoptotic rate in SW13 cells, but there is no
obvious enhancement effect of the combination of FTY720
and mitotane on the apoptosis of H295R (Figure 5C and 5D).

(10 mg/kg) was administered by IP injection per day
for 10 days and tumor growth was observed for more
10 days after the termination of treatment. Our results found
that H295R cell-derived xenograft tumors progressively
grew in the control group, whereas the tumors were
slow-growing in the FTY720-treated group. Tumor
volume was significantly lower in FTY720-treated mice as
compared with control mice (Figure 6A and 6B; P < 0.05).
At the end of experiments, the tumors were isolated
and weighted. Compared with control group, the
mean tumor weight was significantly less in FTY720treated group without affecting body weight obviously
(P < 0.01; Figure 6C and 6D).

FTY720 inhibits xenograft tumor growth
Given the potent inhibitory effects of FTY720 on
ACC growth in vitro, it is believed that FTY720 has the
potential to be highly effective in treating ACC in vivo.
Thus, we sought to determine the inhibition effect of
FTY720 on the tumor growth of H295R cell xenograft.
When tumors reached 70–100 mm3, saline or FTY720

DISCUSSION

and that high expression of SphK1 significantly associated
with advanced stage and poorer overall survival in ACC
patients. Numerous studies have shown that SphK1 is
found to enhance the proliferation ability of cancer cells.
Gucluler et al. showed that overexpression of SphK1
enhances tumor formation of human breast cancer MCF-7
cells in nude mice [16]. In contrast, inhibition of SphK1
could attenuate lung cancer cell growth in vitro as well
as in vivo [17–18]. Consistent with previous studies,
our results found that knockdown of SphK1 by siRNA
markedly surpressed the ability of cell proliferation and
invasion of two ACC cell lines, SW13 and H295R cells.
Recently, targeting the Sphk1 pathway with
specific inhibitors or drugs is an appealing strategy for
the development of effective cancer therapy [19–20].
A sphingosine analogue, dimethylsphingosine, was
the first reported SphK inhibitor to surpress cancer cell
growth [21]. FTY720 was originally developed as an
immunosuppressive agent, which induces lymphopenia

In this study, we determined the critical roles
of SphK1 in ACC pathogenesis and the underlying
mechanisms. First, the SphK1 expression was
overexpressed at the transcription level in ACC tissues,
as we observed a significant increased SphK1 mRNA
level in the ACC group. Second, the SphK1 protein
level was upregulated in ACC group compared with the
ACA tissues, suggesting a novel signaling pathway that
contributes to ACC pathogenesis and aggressive biology.
We also demonstrated that inhibiting SphK1 activity with
specific SphK1 inhibitor or downregulating SphK1 with
RNAi might represent a novel strategy for the treatment
of ACC.
SphK1 is elevated in various types of cancers,
functioning as an oncogene in tumorigenesis [14–15],
however, little is known about the role of SphK1 in ACC
progression. We found that SphK1 is upregulated in ACC

via an inhibition of lymphocytes’ egress from lymphoid
organs through its antagonist function on the lymphocytes’
S1P receptors [22]. In addition, FTY720 could act as a
SphK1 inhibitor to exhibit the antiproliferative effect in
various cancers in a manner independent of S1P receptors
[23–25]. In the present study, we demonstrated for the
first time that FTY720 is able to inhibit ACC cell growth
not only in vitro, but also in vivo in a xenograft model.
In a mouse model of ACC, administration of FTY720 at
10 mg/kg/day inhibited tumor growth without causing
detectable toxicity in vital organs. FTY720 also has a
capacity to inhibit SphK1 enzymatic activity, suggesting
that FTY720 is a SphK1 inhibitor and may be a new

anticancer agent candidate for ACC.
Although the evidence has highlighted the potent
antitumor effect of FTY720 on ACC, the molecular
mechanism is still unclear. To explore the mechanisms
underlying the antitumor effects of FTY720, we tested
the effect of FTY720 on the MAPK and PI3K/AKT
pathways, which have been demonstrated to be involved
in tumor progression [26–27]. It is also well accepted that
overexpression of SphK1 is involved in the activation
of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways [28–30]. It was
consistent with our finding that FTY720 significantly
inhibited the activity of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT

pathways. FTY720 strongly inhibited phosphorylation
of PI3K and AKT as well as ERK expression. Mitotane
(o,p′-DDD) is the standard of care for treatment of ACC
with speciﬁc adrenocortical activity [31]. Mitotane is
effective at inducing a reduction of cell viability in H295R
but not in SW13 cells. In this study, we investigated the
effect of combining mitotane with FTY720 in ACC cells,
and the results showed that the combination only resulted
in a greater anti-proliferative effect over single agent
treatment in SW13 cells, indicating that the combined
therapy of SphK1 inhibition and mitotane may not be
always favorable for ACC patients.
Accumulating evidences have indicated that
upreguration of SphK1 could induce cancer cells resistance
to apoptosis, and FTY720 has also been shown to be a
potent apoptosis inducer in various cancer cells [10, 32]. In
the present study, inhibition of SphK activity by FTY720
could induce apoptosis in ACC in vitro, and the combination
of FTY720 and mitotane had a significant enhancement
effect on the apoptotic rate in SW13 cells.
In conclusion, we showed that SphK1 is
overexpressed in ACC and leads to increased cell
proliferation and invasion, and impairment of apoptosis,
oncogenic transformation. In addition, inhibition of
SphK1, using both FTY720 and siRNA, could suppress
ACC progression in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that
SphK1 inhibition might represent new and potential
strategies against human ACC.

Western blot analysis

Patients and tissue samples

Western immunoblot analyses were performed with
protein lysates obtained from snap-frozen tissue samples
and cultured cells. Twenty micrograms of denatured
total protein was subsequently applied to one end of
10% SDS polyacrylamide gels. The proteins on the gel
were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(Millipore, Temecular, California, USA). The membranes
were blocked and then incubated overnight at 4°C with
primary antibodies: anti-SphK1, anti-PI3K, antiphosphoPI3K (Y607), anti-AKT, antiphospho-AKT (S473),
anti-ERK, antiphospho-ERK (pT202/pY204 + pT185/
pY187) and β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).
Membranes were washed three times and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Target protein bands
were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence
method. All western immunoblot analyses were performed
three times.

The use of pathology specimens of patient subjects
as well as the review of all pertinent patient record
was approved by institutional ethics review board and

two groups: adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs) (N = 22) and
ACCs (N = 24). Besides, freshly frozen tissue samples were
available from 20 ACT patients (10 ACCs and 10 ACAs).
Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately
after surgery.

(< 10%), 2 (10–50%), or 3 (> 50%). The intensity of
staining was determined as: 0 (no staining), 1 (weak
staining, light yellow), 2 (moderate staining, yellow
brown), or 3 (strong staining, brown). The staining index
was calculated as the product of staining intensity and
percentage of positive tumor cells, resulting in scores
of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Specimens with staining index
score of more than or equal to four was considered as
high expression, and less than or equal to three as low
expression.

to 1, and > 1 indicate synergistic, additive and antagonistic
effects, respectively.

Flow cytometric analysis
Apoptotic cell death was identified by double
supravital staining with recombinant FITC (fluorescein
isothiocyanate) conjugated Annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI), using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis
Detection kit (Becton-Dickinson, NJ, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell invasion assay
The extent of cell invasion was assessed using
the BD BioCoatTM MatrigelTM Invasion Chamber
(BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Tumor xenograft study
Animal studies were performed in accordance to an
institutionally approved protocol of Shanghai Jiao Tong
University. Tumor xenografts were established by sc
injection of 2 × 106 H295R cells into flank regions of 4- to
6-wk-old female athymic mice. When the tumor reached
70–100 mm3 in volume, intraperitoneal injections of saline
or FTY720 (10 mg/kg) were administered. Mice were
checked weekly, and tumor nodules were measured with a
caliper. The mice were sacrificed and tumors were excised
and weighed at the end of in vivo experiments.

Knockdown of SphK1 by siRNA transfection
Sequence-specific siRNA against SphK1 was used
to silence SphK1 expression (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
USA). The siRNA sense sequence were 5′-GGGCAA
GGCCUUGCAGCUCd(TT)-3′ and 5′-GAGCUGCAAGGCC
UUGCCCd(TT)-3′ (for SphK1) or scrambled siRNA5′-UUCUC
CGAACGUGUCACGUd(TT)-3′ and 5′-ACGUGACACGU
UCGGAGAAd(TT). Cells were seeded into six-well plates at
a density of 3 × 104 cells per well and transfected with siRNA
(50–100 nM) using the lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h, SphK1 expression
levels were detected by RT-PCR and/or Western blot.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using
the SPSS 10.0 statistical software package. The χ2 test
was used to analyze the relationship between SphK1
expression and the clinicopathologic characteristics.
Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared by the log-rank test. In all cases, P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Sphingosine kinase activity assay
The activity of sphingosine kinase was quantified
by using a commercial Sphingosine Kinase Activity Assay
kit (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, USA) as the
manufacturer instructed.

Cell proliferation assay
The effects of SphK1 siRNA and FTY720 on ACC
cells survival were determined by MTT assay. Cells were
seeded into 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) and cultured
for 120 h. After treatments, cells were incubated with MTT
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 20 μl/well) at 37oC for 4 h,
and then 200 μl DMSO was added into each well. Cells
were subjected to absorbance reading at 570 nm using a
96-well microplate reader. Drug interaction was assessed
using the combination index (CI). Values of CI < 1, equal
