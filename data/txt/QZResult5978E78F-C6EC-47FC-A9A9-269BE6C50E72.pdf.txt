Abstract
Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is of importance for
cancer research because of its role in detoxifying carcinogens,
activating antineoplastic prodrugs, metabolizing chemotherapeutic agents, and its involvement in cell cycle and
apoptosis regulation. Two common GSTP1 genetic polymorphisms have been studied extensively. However, the full range
of GSTP1 genetic variation has not been systematically
characterized in the absence of disease pathology. We set
out to identify common GSTP1 polymorphisms in four ethnic
groups, followed by functional genomic studies. All exons,
splice junctions, and the 5¶-flanking region of GSTP1 were
resequenced using 60 DNA samples each from four ethnic
groups. The 35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified included six nonsynonymous SNPs and 17 previously
unreported polymorphisms. GSTP1 variant allozymes were
then expressed in COS-1 cells, and five displayed significantly
altered levels of enzyme activity. One decreased to 22% of the
wild-type (WT) activity. Four variant allozymes had K m values
that differed significantly from that of the WT, and five
showed altered levels of immunoreactive protein compared
with WT, with a significant correlation (r = 0.79, P < 0.007)
between levels of immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity
in these samples. In the Mexican American population, five
linked SNPs were significantly associated with GSTP1 mRNA
expression, one of which was found by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay to alter protein binding. These studies
have identified functionally significant genetic variation, in
addition to the two frequently studied GSTP1 nonsynonymous
SNPs, that may influence GSTP1’s contribution to carcinogen
and drug metabolism, and possibly disease pathogenesis and/
or drug response. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4791–801]

Introduction
Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is a member of the
cytosolic GST superfamily (1–3). These phase II enzymes catalyze
the glutathione conjugation of a variety of electrophilic xenobiotics,
including substrates that range from environmental toxins and
carcinogens to drugs used in the treatment of cancer (3–6).

Variation in the expression and activity of GSTP1 has been
associated with a variety of human cancers (7–12). GSTP1 can
metabolize and inactivate a number of antineoplastic drugs (4, 11,
13–16), but it can also activate antineoplastic prodrugs, such as
TLK286/TER286 (17). Finally, GSTP1 has been shown to function
not only as a phase II drug-metabolizing enzyme, but also as a
regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) as a result
of nonenzymatic, ligand-binding activity (18–22).
Because of its multiple roles, the genetic regulation of GSTP1 has
been studied extensively, particularly two common nonsynonymous polymorphisms and the methylation state of a CpG island in
its promoter. The CpG island in the GSTP1 promoter has been
reported to be hypermethylated in prostate, hepatocellular, breast,
renal, lung, and colon cancer, as well as some lymphomas (7, 9, 10,
12, 23). Hypermethylation results in reduced GSTP1 expression
(24). When the expression of GSTP1 decreases, it has been
speculated that cells become more susceptible to mutation and
damage as a result of exposure to electrophiles and oxidative stress
(25, 26).
GSTP1 also has two common nonsynonymous single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that result in Ile105Val and Ala114Val
alterations in encoded amino acid sequence. These SNPs have
been associated with variation in cancer risk and in clinical
response to antineoplastic drug therapy (11, 27–30). The Val105
substitution results in steric restriction of the H-site due to shifts in
the side chains of several amino acids. Thus, the Val105 variant
allozyme may be able to accommodate less bulky substrates than
the Ile105 allozyme and, as a result, may display substrate
specificities that differ from those of the wild-type (WT) allozyme
(27, 31). In addition, the thermal stability of the codon 105 variant
allozyme differs from that of the WT (27, 31). These characteristics
may be responsible, in part, for the reported association between
this allozyme and carcinogenesis or variation in response to
antineoplastic drugs (8, 32, 33). As an example of the interest in the
genetics of GSTP1, the CDC HuGEpedia4 lists 462 publications
reporting associations of genetic variation in GSTP1 with health,
associations involving 201 human diseases. Finally, GSTP1 seems to
have functional roles that extend beyond phase II drug metabolism.
Specifically, GSTP1 is an inhibitor of c-Jun-NH2 kinase (JNK) and
TRAF2 (18, 20, 21), resulting in alterations in downstream
processes, such as cell cycle control and apoptosis (34).
Although GSTP1 is clearly an important gene, a systematic study
of common genetic variation in this gene and characterization of
the functional significance of that variation have not been reported.
Therefore, we set out to systematically identify common DNA

sequence variation in GSTP1, followed by the functional characterization of those polymorphisms and determination of mechanisms by which they might alter function. As a first step, all GSTP1
exons, splice junctions, and a portion of the 5¶-flanking region
(5¶-FR) were resequenced using 60 DNA samples each from African
American (AA), Caucasian American (CA), Han Chinese American
(HCA), and Mexican American (MA) subjects. Functional genomic
studies were then performed with all variant allozymes encoded by
alleles containing each of the nonsynonymous cSNPs identified
during the gene resequencing studies. In addition, transcriptional
activity of common 5¶-FR SNPs and haplotypes were assessed with
mRNA microarray and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
The results of these studies provide comprehensive information
with regard to common sequence variation in GSTP1, as well as the
functional consequences of that variation. These data also provide
a foundation for future genotype-phenotype association studies
involving both carcinogenesis risk and inherited variation in
antineoplastic drug response.

Materials and Methods
DNA samples. DNA samples from 60 CA, 60 AA, 60 HCA, and 60 MA
subjects (Human Variation Panel sample sets HD100CAU, HD100AA,
HD100CHI, and HD100MEX) were obtained from the Coriell Cell
Repository. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences had anonymized these DNA samples before deposit, and all subjects had provided
written consent for the use of their DNA for research purposes. These
studies were reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional
Review Board.
GSTP1 gene resequencing. The PCR was used to amplify all GSTP1
exons, intron-exon splice junctions, and f400 bp of the 5¶-FR. Amplification
conditions and primer sequences are listed in the supplementary material.
Amplicons were sequenced on both strands in the Mayo Molecular Biology
Core Facility using dye terminator sequencing chemistry. Polymorphisms
observed only once, as well as any ambiguous sequences, were confirmed by
performing independent amplifications, followed by DNA sequencing.
GSTP1 microarray analysis. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from which the
DNA samples used for the gene resequencing had been obtained were
acquired from the Coriell Cell Repository. Total RNA was extracted from cell
lines corresponding to the DNA samples used in each of the four
populations with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quality assessment was
performed using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer before microarray analysis. All
RNA samples had an Agilent RNA integrity number of >9.0. The RNA was
then reverse-transcribed and biotin labeled for hybridization with
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix). The microarray images
were analyzed with quality control techniques established in the Mayo
Clinic Microarray Core Facility, and the data were normalized using Fastlo, a
version of cyclic loess normalization (35). Data from probe set 200824_at,
corresponding to GSTP1, were used in the analyses described here.
GSTP1 EMSA. Biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides
corresponding to the WT sequences and to the GSTP1 (219) or (18)
variant sequences, together with their corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotides as competitors, were used in these assays. Binding assays were
performed, followed by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing gel and
transfer to a nylon membrane, with detection according to the
manufacturer’s directions using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA
kit (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were prepared from a pool of the
lymphoblastoid cell lines used to perform the microarray analyses.
Specifically, 15 million cells were pelleted at 524  g for 3 min. Cells were
washed in 1 mL of cold PBS and repelleted. The pellet was resuspended in
200 AL of ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9),
10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.4% NP40, 1 mmol/L
DTT, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and protease
inhibitor. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the lysate was centrifuged at
14,000  g for 30 s. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in a buffer

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

containing 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, and protease inhibitor
and was vortexed for 15 s at 4jC. The mixture was then centrifuged at
14,000  g for 10 min and was stored at 80jC. An antibody against acute
myelogenous leukemia-1 (AML-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used in an
attempt to perform a super shift assay. Specifically, 2 AL of antibody were
added to 20 AL of the binding reaction, followed by incubation at room
temperature for 45 min.
GSTP1 expression constructs and transient expression. A WT
expression construct was created by amplifying cDNA from a human liver
cDNA library and cloning the full-length GSTP1 cDNA open reading frame
into the expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax (Invitrogen). Site-directed
mutagenesis was performed using the circular PCR to create variant
allozyme constructs. Sequences of all inserts were confirmed by sequencing
in both directions. Expression constructs for WT and variant allozyme
cDNAs were then transfected into COS-1 cells in serum-free DMEM using
the TransFast reagent (Promega) at a charge ratio of 3:1. Expression of
variant allozymes was performed in a mammalian cell system to ensure that
the mechanism for mammalian posttranslational modification and
degradation would be present. Specifically, 7 Ag of construct DNA were
cotransfected with 7 Ag of pSV-h-galactosidase DNA (Promega) as a control
to correct for possible variation in transfection efficiency. After 48 h, the
cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 1 mL of homogenization buffer,
and lysed with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). The
homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000  g at 4jC for 1 h. The resulting
cytosol preparations were stored at 80jC.
GSTP1 activity assay and substrate kinetics. Enzyme activity was
determined with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB; Sigma-Aldrich) as the
substrate for each recombinant GSTP1 allozyme, using a modification of the
spectrophotometric assay described by Habig and colleagues (36).
Specifically, 100 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 2.5 mmol/L reduced glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.0 mmol/L CDNB
(dissolved in 95% ethanol, final concentration in the assay of 3.2%), and
recombinant enzyme were combined in a final volume of 250 AL. This
reaction mixture was added to a 96-well plate before the addition of the
enzyme and was incubated at room temperature for 2 min. The enzyme
source was then added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 7 min, followed by the measurement of absorbance at 340 nm
in a Safire2 microplate reader (Tecan). The complete reaction mixture
including COS-1 cell high-speed supernatant from cells transfected with
empty vectors served as a blank. The signal-to-noise ratio was 2:1 or greater
over the range of enzyme concentrations used. Activity present in
untransfected COS-1 cells was always subtracted from that of COS-1 cells
transfected with GSTP1 allozyme constructs. Activity for the WT enzyme
was set at 100%, and all other allozymes are reported as percentages of the
WT value. h-Galactosidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically in
the same samples using the Promega h-Galactosidase Assay System, and
levels of enzyme activity were corrected on the basis of the cotransfected
h-galactosidase enzyme activity. The same assay was used to perform
substrate kinetic studies with five concentrations of CDNB that ranged from
0.25 to 2.0 mmol/L but only over the course of a 300-s incubation.
Western blot analysis. Levels of immunoreactive protein were determined for each recombinant GSTP1 allozyme by performing quantitative
Western blot analysis. A mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody (SigmaAldrich) was used to visualize protein bands. Specifically, COS-1 cell cytosol
was loaded onto 12% SDS mini-gels (Bio-Rad) on the basis of levels of the
cotransfected h-galactosidase activity to correct for possible variation in
transfection efficiency. Electrophoresis was performed for 90 min at 120 V,
followed by the transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes. After
blocking for 2 h with 5% powdered milk in TBS with Tween 20 (TBST), the
membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibody diluted
1:20,000 with 5% powdered milk in TBST. The next morning, after three
washes, goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibody (Bio-Rad) was
applied for 2 h at a dilution of 1:10,000, followed by three washes. The
Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western Blotting System (Amersham Biosciences) was then used to detect bound antibody by enhanced
chemiluminescence. The Western blot data were analyzed with the

AutoChemi System (UVP BioImaging Systems). Multiple independent blots
were performed for each allozyme, and the results were expressed as a
percentage of the intensity of the WT allozyme on the same gel.
In vitro translation/degradation assay. Transcription and translation
of GSTP1 allozymes were performed with the TNT Coupled Rabbit
Reticulocyte Lysate (RRL) System (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and cysteine (1,000 Ci/mmol, 2.5 mCi total; Amersham Biosciences).
This reaction mixture was incubated at 37jC for 90 min, and 5 AL aliquots
were used to perform SDS-PAGE. After transcription and translation of the
allozymes, protein degradation experiments were performed as described
previously (37). Specifically, 10 AL of in vitro translated [35S]methionine and
cysteine-labeled protein was added to 40 AL of an ATP-generating system
and 40 AL of untreated RRL. During incubation at 37jC, 10 AL aliquots were
removed at 0, 4, 8, and 24 h, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.
Radioactively labeled protein was quantified using the AutoChemi System
(UVP BioImaging Systems). The rapidly degraded protein TPMT*3A (38)
was used as a positive control for the degradation studies.
Data analysis. Sequence chromatograms from the gene resequencing
studies were analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (Softgenetics). Linkage
disequilibrium among GSTP1 polymorphisms was determined by calculating D¶ values (39, 40), and intragene haplotypes were inferred using the
method described by Schaid and colleagues (41). Graphical representations
of population-specific haplotype block patterns across GSTP1 were
generated using Haploview. Values for p, u, and Tajima’s D were determined
as described by Tajima (42, 43). Genotype-phenotype associations for GSTP1
SNPs were evaluated by race and overall, i.e., for all samples. A linear model
was used to assess the association of each SNP with the quantitative
phenotype of GSTP1 expression. For these analyses, SNP genotypes were
evaluated with a 1-degree-of-freedom test, with SNP genotypes coded as
0, 1, or 2 on the basis of the number of rare variants present. GSTP1
expression values for the genotype-phenotype association studies were log2
transformed and adjusted for gender, race, and storage time. Apparent K m
values were calculated using the GraphPad Prizm 3.0 computer program
(GraphPad). Average levels of recombinant allozyme activity, K m values, and
immunoreactive protein levels were compared with values for the WT
allozyme by the use of Student’s t test.

Results
GSTP1 gene resequencing. We resequenced the exons, splice
junctions, and f400 bp of the 5¶-FR of GSTP1 using 240 DNA
samples, 60 each from AA, CA, HCA, and MA subjects. A total of
35 SNPs were observed, including six nonsynonymous cSNPs
(Fig. 1 and Table 1). There were striking variations in SNP types and
frequencies among the ethnic groups studied. For example, there
were two SNPs, 5¶-FR (219) and 5¶-untranslated region (UTR)
(18) that had very high MAFs, but only in the MA population.
Eight of the SNPs had very high minor allele frequencies (>40%) in
one or more of the populations studied. All SNPs were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium. Although databases populated with polymorphism locations and frequencies are becoming increasingly
complete and useful, there continues to be a need for systematic
in-depth gene resequencing studies. When compared with the SNPs
in dbSNP and the HapMap, 17 of the 35 SNPs that we observed
were novel, and only 10 of our 35 SNPs were present in the HapMap
(release 21a). The fact that only half of the SNPs that we identified
were represented in publicly available databases underscores the
continuing need for gene resequencing. Our gene resequencing
data have been deposited in the NIH database PharmGKB
(Submission ID PS205605).
jD¶j values were calculated for all pairwise combinations of
GSTP1 SNPs, and haplotype analysis was performed. Values for jD¶j
can range from 0 when SNPs are randomly associated, to 1.0, when
they are maximally associated (39, 40). Forty two pairs of SNPs for
samples from AA, 58 SNP pairs for CA, 44 HCA SNP pairs, and 50
SNP pairs for MA subjects were observed to have both a jD¶j value
of z0.8 and a P value of <0.05. These maximally associated SNP
pairs varied among the ethnic groups, as depicted graphically in
Fig. 2. The figure shows the presence of a well-defined haplotype
block in the 5¶-FR of the gene that is most clearly defined in the

NOTE: Polymorphism locations, nucleotide and amino acid sequence changes, variant allele frequencies, and presence in dbSNP are listed for each of
the four ethnic groups. Polymorphisms in exons and UTRs are numbered with the ‘‘A’’ in the ‘‘ATG’’ translation initiation codon being designated ‘‘1.’’
Numbers 5¶ to that position are negative, whereas numbers 3¶ are positive. Nucleotides located within introns (IVSs) are numbered based on their
distance from splice junctions, with distances from 3¶ splice junctions assigned positive numbers and distances from 5¶ splice junctions assigned
negative numbers. Exon nucleotides are ‘‘boxed.’’

MA samples. Although this block does not include the frequently
studied Ile105Val polymorphism, that SNP is tightly linked to this
haplotype block (jD¶j = 1.0, P < 0.001).
GSTP1 haplotypes with a frequency of z1% in any population, as
well as haplotypes containing one or more nonsynonymous cSNPs,
are listed in Table 2. Four GSTP1 haplotypes that involved only
nonsynonymous SNPs had previously been designated *A, *B, *C,
and *D (27, 44). However, because of the large number of SNPs we
had identified, that classification was inadequate to define the full
spectrum of common variation in GSTP1 because those designations often included several haplotypes. Therefore, we have used
a system of nomenclature in which we have assigned numbers
corresponding to the nonsynonymous cSNPs, numbered in order
from the 5¶ to the 3¶ end of the gene, with letters corresponding to

varying combinations of SNPs in addition to the nonsynonymous
cSNPs, listed in order of haplotype frequency (Table 2). For
example, within this classification, the previously described *B
haplotype with the Val105 variant encompasses a number of
haplotypes, designated here as the *2, *6, and *8 haplotype groups.
The previously described *C haplotype that included both the
Val105 and Val114 polymorphisms would be the *3 group, and the
previously described *D haplotype with Ile105 and Val114 is
designated *4 (Table 2).
We also calculated nucleotide diversity, a measure of genetic
variation, adjusted for the number of alleles studied. Two standard
measures of nucleotide diversity are p, average heterozygosity per
site, and u , a population mutation measure that is theoretically
equal to the neutral mutation variable. Values for Tajima’s D, a test

for the neutral mutation hypothesis (42, 43), were also calculated.
Under conditions of neutrality, Tajima’s D should equal 0. p and u
did not differ significantly among the four populations studied, and
Tajima’s D did not differ statistically from 0 in any of the
populations (Supplementary Table A).
GSTP1 microarray analysis. Expression microarray studies
were performed to determine whether a correlation might exist
between GSTP1 genotype and basal mRNA expression in the lymphoblastoid cells from which the DNA used for gene resequencing
had been obtained. There was wide variation in expression among
individual samples (Fig. 3A). It has been shown that sequences that
influence transcription can be located 5¶ of a gene, in introns, or
3¶ of a gene (45). Therefore, to assess polymorphisms that might
alter GSTP1 mRNA expression, a SNP association analysis was
performed to identify any polymorphisms throughout the length of
the gene that might influence expression. That analysis showed
that five SNPs (219, 18, IVS1-20, Exon 5 +313, and Exon 7 +555)
were significantly associated with level of GSTP1 expression
(P = 7.9  106, 3.2  106, 2.4  103, 6.9  104, and 3.6  104,

respectively). Four of these SNPs were still significant after
correction for multiple comparisons (219, P = 2.8  104,
18, P = 1.1  104, Exon 5 +313, P = 0.024, and Exon 7 +555,
P = 0.013), and all four were associated with decreased GSTP1
expression for the variant nucleotide. When this analysis was
performed separately for each of the four ethnic groups, these same
five SNPs were associated with mRNA expression in the MA
population, with lower P values than in the overall analysis
(6.8  109, 6.8  109, 2.1  104, 7.3  107, and 3.0  106,
respectively), and in this case, all five SNPs remained significant
after correction for multiple comparisons. None of the SNPs were
significantly associated with GSTP1 mRNA expression when
analyzed in the other three populations. That may be true because
two of the five SNPs, (219) and (18), were found at much higher
frequencies in MA subjects than in the other three populations.
Data for the (18) 5¶-FR SNP are displayed graphically in Fig. 3B.
In the MA population, all five SNPs were tightly linked, with jD¶j
of 1.0, P < 0.0001. Based on transcription factor binding prediction
(TFSEARCH v.1.3), the (219) variant nucleotide was predicted

NOTE: White type on black highlights variant nucleotides compared with those present in the most common haplotype in the AA population (the WT).
Designations for haplotypes were made on the basis of alterations in the encoded amino acid sequence (number) and allele frequency (letters)—starting
with the most common haplotype in the AA population. Numbers for variant allozymes were assigned from the NH2 terminus to the COOH terminus of
the protein. Letters refer to haplotypes encoding the same amino acid sequence, from most to least common, beginning with the most common
haplotype in the AA population. A previous set of designations based only on nonsynonymous SNPs, excluding all other polymorphisms (previous
designations), are also listed (25, 41).

to eliminate an E47 transcription factor binding site, whereas
the (18) SNP was predicted to cause the gain of an AML-1a
binding site. Presence of the variant nucleotides for both of these
SNPs was associated with a decrease in mRNA expression, and each
separately explained f41% of the variation in GSTP1 mRNA
expression in the MA population. Taken together, these five SNPs
explained 51% of the variation in expression in the MA population.
None of the other three SNPs were predicted to cause a change in
transcription factor binding. For that reason, and because the
(219) and (18) polymorphisms displayed the lowest P values in
all of our analyses, we focused on those two SNPs in subsequent
experiments. It should be emphasized that transcription regulation
is highly tissue-specific and cell-specific, so the results shown in Fig.
3 apply only to these lymphoblastoid cells.
GSTP1 EMSA. To evaluate the (219) and (18) SNPs, which
were predicted to possibly alter transcription factor binding sites,
EMSAs were performed using oligonucleotides corresponding to

both WT and variant sequences. A shift was observed when the
(18) variant sequence was exposed to lymphoblastoid cell nuclear
extracts (Fig. 3C). This observation was consistent with the
TFSEARCH prediction that the variant nucleotide at position
(18) would introduce an AML-1a binding site. However, we were
unable to detect a super shift with commercially available AML-1
antibody (data not shown). No shift was observed with either WT
or variant sequences at the (219) position (data not shown).
GSTP1 variant allozyme activity assay and substrate
kinetics. Functional genomic studies were also performed to
explore the possible effects of GSTP1 nonsynonymous SNPs on
function. WT GSTP1 and the eight variant allozymes, six with a
single variant amino acid, and two with a combination of two
amino acid variants each—based on the results of the haplotype
analysis (Table 2)—were expressed in COS-1 cells. A mammalian
cell line was used to perform these experiments to ensure the
presence of mammalian posttranslational modification and protein

degradation systems. That was important because it has been
shown repeatedly that the alteration of only one or two amino
acids as a result of genetic polymorphisms can be associated with
drastic changes in the level of protein, often due to rapid protein
degradation through a ubiquitin-proteasome–mediated process
(37, 38). After correction for transfection efficiency, the Val105
and Trp187 variants showed the most striking changes in activity
with CDNB as the substrate compared with the WT allozyme, with
21.8 F 4.3% (P < 1  106) and 55.2 F 5.9% (P < 0.001) of the
activity of the WT allozyme, respectively. The Val114 variant
displayed 79.9 F 5.1% (P < 0.05), the Val32/Val105 double variant
displayed 65.3 F 5.7% (P < 0.001), and the Val105/Val114 double
variant displayed 74.1 F 5.2% (P < 0.01) of the activity of the
WT GSTP1 allozyme (Fig. 4A).
One way in which changes in the encoded amino acid might alter
enzyme activity is through changes in substrate kinetics. Therefore,
we also determined apparent K m values for the WT and variant
allozymes after transient expression in COS-1 cells. As reported
previously (27, 29, 46, 47), the Val105 variant had a significantly
higher apparent K m value, 1.51 F 0.20 mmol/L, than did the WT
Ile105 protein, 0.92 F 0.10 mmol/L (Fig. 4B). The Asn58, Val114, and
Val105/Val114 variant allozymes also differed significantly from WT
in apparent K m values (Fig. 4B). Although these differences in K m
were statistically significant, they may not be biologically significant. Therefore, we also measured the level of immunoreactive
protein for WT and each of the eight variant allozymes.

GSTP1 Western blot analysis. GSTP1 recombinant allozymes
were used to perform quantitative Western blot analyses. After
correction for transfection efficiency, five of the variant allozymes
with one or two changes in encoded amino acids displayed
significantly decreased levels of immunoreactive protein when
compared with the WT allozyme: Val32 at 71.1 F 8.8% (P < 0.05),
Asn58 at 77.3 F 7.3% (P < 0.05), Val105 at 80.2 F 2.5% (P < 0.001),
Trp187 at 37.9 F 4.7% (P < 0.001), and Val32/Val105 at 75.6 F 8.0%
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4C). These quantitative Western blot results correlated
with the observed levels of GSTP1 enzyme activity with an r P value of
0.79 (P < 0.007) or 0.94 (P < 0.0002) if the outlier point corresponding
to the Val105 allozyme was excluded (Fig. 4D). The next experiment
was performed in an attempt to understand why several GSTP1
variant allozymes might have decreases in protein quantity, as well
as significant reductions in level of activity. Although there are
several possible explanations, accelerated protein degradation has
been the most common mechanism responsible for these reductions
in protein quantity and, thus, reductions in enzyme activity for
a large number of variant allozymes for other enzymes that have
been studied in detail (37, 38, 48).
In vitro translation/degradation. In an attempt to determine
whether accelerated degradation might be responsible for
decreases in enzyme activity and level of immunoreactive protein
for GSTP1 variant allozymes, in vitro translation and degradation
experiments for GSTP1 variant allozymes were performed with a
rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Although we were able to synthesize

obtain evidence for accelerated degradation of the variant allozymes, although a positive control, the rapidly degraded
TPMT*3A variant allozyme (37), was degraded very rapidly (data
not shown).

Discussion
GSTP1 catalyzes the conjugation of reactive electrophiles
with glutathione (4–6). It also participates in the regulation of
MAPK pathways (18, 20, 22). GSTP1 is genetically polymorphic, and

two GSTP1 nonsynonymous SNPs have been studied extensively in
the epidemiology literature (27–29). For example, a simple PubMed
Search for GSTP1 polymorphism yielded 552 hits. In the present
study, we set out to systematically identify common GSTP1 genetic
variation in four ethnic groups, followed by functional genomic
studies designed to begin to define the biological significance of
that variation. Specifically, we resequenced GSTP1 exons, splice
junctions, and a portion of the 5¶-FR that contains the core
promoter. We also performed functional genomic studies, including enzyme activity assays, substrate kinetics studies, Western
blots, and mRNA expression array analysis.

We identified 35 GSTP1 SNPs, half of which were not represented
in databases such as dbSNP and the HapMap. The SNPs observed
and their frequencies varied widely among ethnic groups, raising
the possibility of variations in cancer risk and differential response
to antineoplastic therapy among ethnic groups. In contrast, several
novel SNPs were present in multiple ethnic groups with relatively
high MAFs. These polymorphisms varied from nonsynonymous
SNPs that altered the encoded amino acids to 5¶-FR polymorphisms
that could potentially influence transcription. Microarray analysis
showed large interindividual differences in GSTP1 mRNA expression in lymphoblastoid cells (Fig. 3A). Five SNPs that were
significantly associated with level of GSTP1 mRNA in the MA
population were identified. However, those SNPs did not seem to
explain the full extent of variation in expression and were not
significant in the other populations studied, most likely as a result
of their lower frequencies in those populations—an observation
that was especially striking for the two SNPs in the 5¶-FR,
(219) and (18). Our EMSA studies showed that the variant
nucleotide at (18) resulted in protein binding that was not
observed with the WT sequence (Fig. 3C). Because this functional
SNP is tightly linked with the heavily studied Ile(105)Val polymorphism, it is possible that a portion of the association of the

www.aacrjournals.org

codon 105 polymorphism with various clinical phenotypes may
result from the effect on transcription of the G(18)A SNP.
Although the five linked SNPs in the MA population are associated
with f51% of GSTP1 variation in mRNA expression, there is
considerable variation—especially in the populations with low
frequency of these SNPs—which is not explained even in this one
type of cell. The GSTP1 promoter has been shown to be
hypermethylated in a variety of cancers, so one possible additional
explanation for differences in mRNA expression could be that
genetic polymorphisms result in variation in baseline promoter
methylation status and, thus, mRNA expression. However, work by
Han and colleagues indicates that, in the absence of disease, GSTP1
promoter methylation is conserved across tissue types and among
individual subjects (49). Therefore, other variables, such as differences in transacting factors, posttranscriptional modification, and
altered mRNA stability or transcription factor binding due to SNPs
outside of the resequenced region, may be responsible for the
remaining interindividual variation in mRNA expression.
After expression in COS-1 cells, several GSTP1 variant allozymes
showed moderate decreases in enzyme activity, most strikingly
for the extensively studied Val105 variant allozyme (Fig. 4A). Our
laboratory has shown for a large number of cytosolic proteins that

enzyme function is most often influenced by the change in a single
amino acid as a result of changes in protein levels (37, 38, 50–52).
The results shown in Fig. 4D show a similar trend for GSTP1. When
the mechanism responsible for this relationship has been studied,
most often it has been found to result from an alteration in the
rate of protein degradation (37, 38, 50–52). In this study, levels of
GSTP1 enzyme activity for variant allozymes were highly correlated
with levels of immunoreactive protein, r = 0.79 or 0.94, excluding
Val105. The Val105 variant allozyme was an outlier in this analysis,
which was not surprising because it has been reported previously
that this amino acid change alters the active site of the enzyme
and, as a result, substrate specificity (27, 31, 44, 46). Our substrate
kinetic studies confirmed those reports and showed a significantly
increased apparent K m of the Val105 variant allozyme with CDNB as
substrate (Fig. 4B). However, in vitro translation/degradation
studies failed to show differences in rates of protein degradation
for GSTP1 variant allozymes, including Val105. Of interest was the
fact that double variant allozymes—those with both Val105 and an
additional amino acid alteration—did not display as dramatic a
decrease in enzyme activity as did the Val105 variant allozyme.
What is clear is that GSTP1 represents an enzyme for which genetic
variation in encoded amino acid sequence is responsible for
alteration in level of enzyme activity as a result of at least two
mechanisms—changes in the active site, e.g., Val105, and differences
in levels of enzyme protein.
Finally, there has been increasing interest in interactions
between GSTP1 and cell signaling molecules, such as JNK. Holley
and colleagues recently reported differential effects of GSTP1
haplotypes on cell proliferation and apoptosis (34). Those
investigators showed that GSTP1*A (WT) reduced cellular

proliferation and was antiapoptotic through a JNK-independent
mechanism, whereas GSTP1*C (Val105/Val114) did not influence
proliferation and was antiapoptotic—through a JNK-mediated
mechanism. These observations raise the possibility that other
GSTP1 SNPs, such as those reported here, may alter interactions of
GSTP1 with JNK, a hypothesis that should be the focus of future
studies.
In summary, in the present study, we have applied a comprehensive and systematic genotype-to-phenotype research strategy to characterize common genetic variation in GSTP1, a gene
that encodes a protein that plays diverse roles, from phase II drug
metabolism to the regulation of apoptosis. Knowledge of common
GSTP1 SNPs and haplotypes, as well as understanding of their
functional implications, should contribute both to mechanistic and
epidemiologic studies of the involvement of GSTP1 in carcinogenesis, as well as individual variation in response to antineoplastic
drug therapy.
