Abstract

Author Manuscript

Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14; TNFRSF12A) is the cell surface receptor for the
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK). The
Fn14 gene is normally expressed at low levels in healthy tissues but expression is significantly
increased after tissue injury and in many solid tumor types, including glioblastoma (GB; formerly
referred to as ‘glioblastoma multiforme’ or GBM). GB is the most common and aggressive
primary malignant brain tumor, and the current standard-of-care therapeutic regimen has a
relatively small impact on patient survival, primarily because glioma cells have an inherent
propensity to invade into normal brain parenchyma, which invariably leads to tumor recurrence
and patient death. Despite major, concerted efforts to find new treatments, a new GB therapeutic
that improves survival has not been introduced since 2005. In this review article, we summarize
studies indicating that (i) Fn14 gene expression is low in normal brain tissue but up-regulated in
advanced brain cancers and, in particular, in GB tumors exhibiting the mesenchymal molecular
subtype, (ii) Fn14 expression can be detected in glioma cells residing in both the tumor core and
invasive rim regions, with the maximal levels found in the invading glioma cells located within
normal brain tissue, and (iii) TWEAK:Fn14 engagement as well as Fn14 overexpression can
stimulate glioma cell migration, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. We
also discuss two new therapeutic platforms that are currently in development that leverage Fn14

Introduction
The TWEAK-Fn14 Cytokine-Receptor Axis

Author Manuscript

TWEAK, a member of the TNF superfamily,1 acts on cells via binding to Fn14, a 102-aa
type I transmembrane protein that was initially discovered as a growth factor-inducible gene
product2,3 and then subsequently identified as the TWEAK receptor by Wiley and
colleagues.4 TWEAK is initially synthesized as a type II transmembrane protein but it can
be cleaved by furin to generate a soluble cytokine.1,5 Both the membrane-anchored and
soluble TWEAK isoforms can bind to Fn14.5,6 TWEAK:Fn14 engagement promotes Fn14
trimerization and TNFR associated factor (TRAF) binding to the Fn14 cytoplasmic tail,7
which activates a number of intracellular signal transduction cascades (e.g., the NF-κB
pathway). This can result in increased cell proliferation, survival, migration, differentiation
or death, depending on the cellular context (Figure 1).8-10 Also, TWEAK is a proinflammatory11,12 and pro-angiogenic13,14 cytokine in vivo.

Author Manuscript

The TWEAK and Fn14 genes are expressed at low levels in most healthy normal tissues but
increased expression has been noted after tissue injury8-10 and in many solid primary tumor
types and tumor metastases. For example, TWEAK is highly expressed in liver,17 ovarian,18
colorectal,14,19 bladder,20 esophageal,21 pancreatic,21 and prostate22 cancers as well as a
high percentage of prostate cancer metastases.22 Fn14 overexpression has been detected in
over a dozen solid tumor types,23,24 including the tumor types mentioned
above3,18,20-22,25,26 as well as brain cancer (see below),15,27 breast cancer,28-31 lung
cancer,32,33 and melanoma.34 It has also been reported that Fn14 is highly expressed in the
metastatic lesions of breast,29 colorectal,23 melanoma,34 non-small cell lung,35 and
prostate22 cancer patients.

Studies using TWEAK-null mice, Fn14-null mice, or anti-TWEAK neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) have revealed that transient TWEAK/Fn14 signaling after acute tissue
injury is critical for efficient wound repair.8-10 However, chronic, dysregulated Fn14
activation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several prominent human diseases,
including cancer, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel
diseases.8-10,36-39 Accordingly, a number of TWEAK- or Fn14-targeted therapeutic agents
are presently in pre-clinical development36,37 and some agents have progressed into early
phase clinical trials.24,40

oligodendrocytes).41,42 Glial cell tumors, collectively referred to as gliomas, represent
∼80% of all malignant brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors, and glioblastoma
(GB; World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioma)43 is the most common and lethal
primary malignant brain tumor, with ∼10,000 new cases in the USA per year.44,45 GB
tumors are characterized by extensive vascularization, a high mitotic index, cellular
pleomorphism, genomic instability, and tissue necrosis.44 Technological advances during the
past decade have allowed investigators to interrogate hundreds of GB surgical specimens at
the molecular level using genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic
analyses.42,46-48 This research has catalogued the most common genetic alterations
associated with this cancer type (i.e., gene mutations, amplifications, deletions), thereby
revealing several constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinases and intracellular signaling
nodes that may be targeted by precision therapeutics.42,46,49 These studies and others have
also demonstrated that although GB tumors exhibit significant intra-tumor molecular
heterogeneity,50-54 they can be classified into four major subtypes - proneural, neural,
classical, and mesenchymal - by whole genome sequencing and expression profiling of
surgically resected samples.42,46,48,49,51,55 Each GB subtype is defined by a common
genomic landscape, transcriptional profile, disease pathophysiology, and patient
prognosis.42,46,48,49,51,55

The current standard-of-care for patients with GB consists of maximal surgical resection or
biopsy followed by high-dose radiation and concomitant oral chemotherapy using the DNAalkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ; brand name Temodar),56 which can cross the blood
brain barrier (BBB) because of its small size and lipophilic properties. Despite this
multimodal course of treatment, the median overall survival of GB patients is ∼15 months
after diagnosis,56,57 with ∼95% of patients succumbing to this disease within five years.45
Patients whose tumors exhibit epigenetic silencing of the DNA repair enzyme O6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) experience the best treatment
outcomes,57-59 but disease progression occurs in all patients. One of the primary reasons for
poor patient prognosis is that glioma cells are highly invasive; consequently, there is
extensive tumor cell infiltration into surrounding healthy brain tissue.60-62 These invading
cells, which can be found centimeters away from the main tumor mass, cannot be removed
by surgical resection of the tumor core or safely targeted by adjuvant radiotherapy because
of the potential to harm nearby normal neurons and glial cells. Glioma cells residing in
tumor margins are also relatively resistant to chemotherapeutics, primarily due to the
BBB,63 so these cells frequently transition from an invasive to a proliferative state, which
leads to tumor recurrence, brain injury, and patient death. Thus, novel therapies that target
the invasive rim cells left behind after surgical resection are sorely needed in order to
significantly improve the survival of GB patients. This is a challenging problem as there are
several critical barriers to effective delivery of GB therapeutics (see below). These barriers
include: (i) the BBB, (ii) the electrostatically charged and anisotropic extracellular space
(ECS) found between brain cells, which contains extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and
proteoglycans, and (iii) the glialymphatic system,64 a paravascular, pseudo-lymphatic
drainage pathway that can act as a sink for small molecule drugs, gene therapy constructs,
and protein-based therapeutics.65,66

Challenges to GB patient therapy

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The location of GB tumors presents several unique barriers to systemic drug treatment.65,66
First, the BBB, consisting of cerebral endothelial cells connected together by tight junctions,
a thick basement membrane, and astrocytic end-feet, controls the passage of most molecules
and drugs from the blood circulation to the brain.63,67 It has been estimated that >98% of
small-molecule drugs, and nearly all biologics (e.g., therapeutic mAbs) do not cross the
BBB.68 While this barrier is altered in the hypoxic core region of advanced brain tumors,69
unresectable, invading tumor cells are consistently found in brain regions exhibiting a
relatively intact BBB.70-72 As mentioned above, these invading tumor cells are difficult to
treat due to their close proximity to functioning brain cells and contribute to tumor
recurrence. Second, the anisotropic, electrostatically charged ECS found between brain cells,
which contains a dense network of ECM components,73,74 comprises 10-20% of total brain
volume and acts as a ‘brain penetration barrier’ (BPB) for both systemic and local drug
delivery.75,76 It has been suggested that the ECS in brain tumors may constitute a larger
percentage of the total brain volume compared to the healthy brain ECS, with a more
complex, tortuous structure and smaller pores.77 Several strategies have been proposed to
transiently disrupt the BBB to improve the delivery of therapeutic agents to GB tumors (e.g.,
intra-arterial mannitol, focused ultrasound) but each of these methods have limitations that
must be overcome before widespread clinical use.63,65,78

Author Manuscript

In consideration of the challenges associated with systemic drug administration, there is
great interest in applying local drug delivery strategies for the treatment of malignant
gliomas.65,66,79 Gliadel® is an FDA-approved, biodegradable, polyanhydride-based polymer
wafer containing the alkylating agent carmustine (BCNU: N,N′-bis-[2-chloroethyl]-Nnitrosurea), a chemotherapeutic that exhibits high hematologic cell toxicity when
administered systemically.79-81 These wafers, which are ∼1.5 cm in diameter, are implanted
into the surgical resection cavity following tumor excision. Gliadel® wafer implantation
produces a small but significant improvement in median patient survival time compared to
placebo wafers (∼2 months).79,80,82 For this form of interstitial chemotherapy, drug delivery
is mediated by diffusion; consequently, Gliadel® efficacy is likely limited, at least in part, by
the inability to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations more than a few millimeters beyond
the immediate tumor resection margin.80,83

Author Manuscript

Another local drug delivery technique that has been used for GB patients is convectionenhanced delivery (CED), which is a hydrostatic and osmotic pressure-driven infusion
method to generate bulk flow of therapeutic agents through the brain interstitial
spaces.66,79,84 Animal studies and human clinical trials have been carried out using CED as
a means to deliver various anti-cancer agents including conventional chemotherapeutics,
nanoparticles (NPs), mAbs, and targeted toxins to malignant glioma cells.85 Several
limitations to the success of this approach were noted in the early GB CED trials; for
example, catheter placement can greatly effect drug delivery86-89 and there is a certain
degree of drug backflow along the catheter.79,90 Also, even with CED, there is poor drug
penetration to the infiltrative glioma cells residing in the invasive rim region (the brain area
at risk for tumor recurrence).89 Accordingly, efforts are underway to optimize the CED
approach, including the use of real-time imaging techniques to assess the best catheter

positioning and infusion parmeters for effective drug distribution.91-94 In summary, for both
systemic and local drug delivery methods, the limited penetration of therapeutic agents into
tumor cell-infiltrated normal brain tissue remains a key hurdle to increasing the survival of
GB patients.

The TWEAK-Fn14 Axis and Glioblastoma
Fn14 gene expression is up-regulated in advanced brain cancers and, in particular, in GB
tumors exhibiting the mesenchymal molecular subtype

Author Manuscript

The first study reporting that Fn14 gene expression was elevated in GB samples compared to
normal brain tissue was published by Tran et al. in 2003.27 Fn14 mRNA levels were
analyzed by real time qPCR in three normal brain samples, one oligodendroglioma, two
pilocytic astrocytomas, two low-grade astrocytomas, four anaplastic astrocytomas, and 16
GBs. The highest expression of Fn14 mRNA was observed in the GB specimens, with
∼70% of the samples showing 5-fold induction over normal brain tissue. Subsequent gene
expression profiling experiments using larger sample numbers have confirmed Fn14 mRNA
levels are low in normal brain and increase with glioma grade.15,95,96 In addition, it has been
reported that Fn14 mRNA expression levels in GB tumors inversely correlate with patient
survival.15 Finally, Fn14 is one of the 37 genes up-regulated in the poor prognosis group of a
58-gene signature that is a strong prognostic predictor for patients diagnosed with
oligodendroglial or astrocytic tumors, including GB.97

Author Manuscript

Elevated Fn14 expression in the GB tumor core has also been observed at the protein level
using immunohistochemistry (IHC).15,27,98 In one report, Fn14 expression was examined
using a brain tumor tissue microarray and an Fn14-specific mAb and the stain intensity was
scored as negative, weak, moderate or strong.15 All nine of the non-neoplastic brain
specimens had no staining or weak staining; in contrast, only four of the 27 GB specimens
were scored negative or weak while the other 23 specimens exhibited moderate or strong
staining.

Author Manuscript

We recently interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GB tumor dataset to examine
Fn14 mRNA expression levels in 195 tumors representing the four different GB molecular
subtypes that were mentioned above. This analysis revealed that Fn14 gene expression is
most frequently up-regulated in mesenchymal subtype tumors (Figure 2). Mesenchymal
subtype tumors frequently exhibit constitutive NF-κB99 and STAT3100 activation so this
finding is consistent with studies indicating that Fn14 is an NF-κB- and STAT3/5-regulated
gene (Tran, unpublished data).15,101 Tumors with the mesenchymal gene expression
signature are highly aggressive, invasive tumors that primarily arise de novo, and patients
harboring these tumors have the poorest prognosis.42,46,48,49,51,55 Interestingly, some
proneural subtype GB tumors, upon recurrence, tend to shift toward the mesenchymal
subtype, and Phillips et al. have reported that Fn14 mRNA expression is significantly upregulated (∼2.4-fold increase) in those recurrent tumors where this phenotypic shift is
detected.55
The finding that Fn14 is frequently overexpressed in mesenchymal subtype tumors has
several clinical implications. First, Halliday et al. recently reported that when mice bearing

high-grade gliomas resembling the proneural GB subtype were exposed to ionizing
radiation, there was a rapid change in the global gene expression pattern, and these changes
were indicative of a proneural to mesenchymal subtype phenotypic transition.104 This
implies that Fn14 levels may increase following brain irradiation, which could in theory
sensitize radioresistant GB cells to Fn14-targeted therapeutics (see below). Second, Sullivan
et al. reported in 2014 that GB patients contain circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and that
these cells express mesenchymal subtype classifier genes and have an invasive phenotype.105
Accordingly, if these CTCs express Fn14, one could potentially use Fn14 mAbs as an
affinity reagent as part of an immunoselection protocol to detect and capture this cell
population (i.e., liquid biopsy). The GB CTCs could then be subjected to genomic/
transcriptomic analyses to guide patient therapy decisions.

Glioma cells that are migrating on ECM in vitro or invading into brain tissue in vivo
express relatively high levels of Fn14 in comparison to stationary cells

Author Manuscript

In 2001, Mariani et al. reported that plating glioma cell lines on a glioma cell-derived ECM
instead of an untreated or bovine serum albumin (BSA)-treated plastic surface leads to an
accelerated migratory rate, and cDNA microarray analysis identified Fn14 as one of the
genes that was most significantly up-regulated in migration-activated cells.106 Elevated Fn14
gene expression in migrating glioma cells was subsequently confirmed using Northern and
Western blot analyses.27 To test if Fn14 was also overexpressed in glioma cells invading in
vivo, Tran et al. collected GB tumor core and invasive rim cells from three surgical
specimens by laser capture microdissection, isolated RNA, and examined Fn14 transcript
levels by real time qPCR. They found a 4- to 6-fold induction of Fn14 transcript in the cells
located at the rim compared to matched core cells.15 Two IHC studies have confirmed high
Fn14 gene expression in invasive rim cells.15,107 In the most extensive study, Fortin et al.
prepared a glioma invasion tissue microarray containing representative punches of tumor
core, edge and invasive rim from 44 GB specimens and Fn14 immunostaining intensity was
scored as negative, weak, moderate or strong. They found that 94.4%, 88.4%, and 100% of
the core, edge and rim samples, respectively, had either moderate or strong Fn14
expression.107 A representative example of IHC staining of normal brain tissue and the
invasive rim region of an Fn14-positive GB surgical specimen is shown in Figure 3. The
molecular basis for elevated Fn14 gene expression in migrating/invading glioma cells
compared to stationary cells is not known; however, as mentioned above, Fn14 is an NF-κBinducible gene,15,101 and Dhruv et al. have reported that increased NF-κB activity is
associated with glioma cell migration in vitro and invasion in vivo.108

TWEAK treatment of Fn14-positive glioma cells stimulates migration, invasion, and
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro
Although TWEAK is the only known ligand for Fn14, there have been only three reports
comparing TWEAK gene expression in normal brain versus brain tumors. Tran et al.
assayed TWEAK mRNA expression levels in normal brain versus GB tissue using real time
qPCR and found that TWEAK mRNA was downregulated in 9/10 GB samples.27 In a
second study by this same group, TWEAK gene expression levels were mined in an
Affymetrix gene expression profile dataset consisting of 24 non-neoplastic brain samples
and 160 surgical samples representing different glioma tumor grades, including 82 GB

specimens. TWEAK mRNA expression was detected but expression levels did not vary
across the sample set.15 In a recent report, TWEAK protein expression was detected in lowand high-grade glioma specimens by IHC.98 Taken together, these studies indicate that the
TWEAK cytokine is most likely present in the GB tissue microenvironment, and for this
reason it is of interest to determine the effect of TWEAK:Fn14 engagement on glioma cell
biology.

Author Manuscript

It has been shown that TWEAK treatment of various Fn14-positive glioma cell lines (e.g.,
SF767, U118, T98G, U87, A172) stimulates cell migration in both a microliter scale radial
assay using laminin-coated glass slides27,109,110 and in a modified Boyden chamber assay
with TWEAK added to the lower well culture medium.111 Important molecular mediators of
this cellular response have been identified, including TRAF2,110 the Src family kinase
member Lyn,111 the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) SGEF, Ect2 and Trio, and
the Rho GTPases Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoG.109,110 Several of these signaling proteins,
including Lyn111 and SGEF,110 are overexpressed in GB tumors. Recently, Cherry et al.
reported that TWEAK also stimulates glioma cell invasion using a three-dimensional Type 1
collagen matrix assay.112 They also found that TWEAK:Fn14 engagement increased matrix
metalloprotease (MMP)-9 gene expression, consistent with a previous report using T98G
glioma cells,113 and that TWEAK pro-invasive activity was reduced in the presence of the
pan-MMP inhibitor GM6001.

Author Manuscript

Finally, two studies have demonstrated that activation of the TWEAK/Fn14 axis can
promote glioma cell survival following exposure to the pro-apoptotic TNF superfamily
member TRAIL or the chemotherapeutic agents camptothecin (a DNA topoisomerase 1
inhibitor) and TMZ (mentioned above).107,114 TWEAK-triggered cell survival is mediated,
at least in part, by activation of the NF-κB and Akt2 signaling pathways and the enhanced
expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-W.107,114 Interestingly, IHC
analysis of 44 GB specimens revealed a positive correlation between Fn14 and Akt2
expression levels.107 A summary of the molecular pathways currently implicated in
TWEAK regulation of glioma cell migration, invasion and survival is shown in Figure 4.
Many of these same pathways may be stimulated by TWEAK-independent Fn14 activation
as well (see below).
High Fn14 expression levels in glioma cells appears to trigger the same cellular responses
that are observed after TWEAK treatment of Fn14-positive cells

Author Manuscript

Several studies have demonstrated that forced Fn14 overexpression in glioma cells can
activate intracellular signaling15,114 and promote migration,15,113 invasion15,109 and cell
survival.114 For example, Fortin et al. reported in 2012 that adenovirus-mediated
overexpression of full-length, wild-type Fn14, but not an Fn14 cytoplasmic tail deletion
mutant that is unable to bind TRAFs and activate intracellular signaling cascades, increases
U118 and T98G glioma cell invasion in an ex vivo rat brain slice invasion assay.109 These
authors also assessed the ability of Fn14 to promote mouse astrocyte migration in vivo using
the replication-competent avian sarcoma-leukosis virus long terminal repeat with splice
acceptor (RCAS)/tumor virus A (TVA) gene delivery system.115 For these experiments,
chicken DF-1 cells infected with an RCAS-Fn14 construct were delivered intracranially into

transgenic mice engineered to express TVA, the avian cell surface receptor for the RCAS
virus, under control of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrilic acid protein (GFAP) promoter.
They found that forced Fn14 expression induced mouse astrocyte migration in the brain.
One issue with the Fn14 overexpression studies described above is the possibility that the
amount of Fn14 produced in cells engineered to overexpress this receptor may greatly
exceed the Fn14 levels found in glioma cells in vivo, which could trigger non-physiological
Fn14 functions. Accordingly, it is important to note that Fn14 siRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenously-expressed Fn14 in glioma cells reduces invasive capacity in the
rat brain slice invasion assay.15

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Taken together, these Fn14 overexpression/depletion studies support the possibility that
elevated Fn14 gene expression in GB tumors may have important biological consequences
(e.g., increase glioma cell invasiveness) even in the absence of the Fn14 ligand TWEAK.
Indirect evidence supporting the concept of TWEAK-independent Fn14 signaling was
summarized in two earlier review articles8,116 but the strongest experimental evidence for
this signaling mechanism was published in 2013.117 In this report, Brown et al. showed that
the transient overexpression of an Fn14 mutant that is unable to bind TWEAK can activate
the NF-κB pathway. The most likely explanation for this finding is that Fn14 overexpression
in cells triggers receptor self-association (“multimerization”), which leads to TRAF binding
and downstream signaling. If Fn14 expression levels alone can regulate Fn14 signaling
output in vivo, then this would have obvious clinical implications. Specifically, if TWEAKindependent Fn14 signaling is the main driver of GB pathophysiology, then TWEAK-Fn14
axis-directed therapeutic agents that act by blocking TWEAK binding to Fn14-positive cells
may not be ideal for GB patient use. Several agents of this type have been described in the
literature, including TWEAK-neutralizing mAbs,24,118 Fn14-directed mAbs,119,120 and the
Fn14-binding small molecule L524-0366.121

Therapeutic strategies that leverage Fn14 overexpression in GB tumors as
a way to deliver cytotoxins or chemotherapy drugs to glioma cells while
sparing healthy neurons and glial cells

Author Manuscript

Comprehensive overviews of the various TWEAK-Fn14 axis-targeted therapeutic agents in
development were published recently.36,37 Here, we will focus on two therapeutic strategies
that use Fn14 as a cell surface portal for the delivery of pro-apoptotic proteins or
chemotherapeutic agents into cancer cells; in the context of GB, the ultimate goal is to kill
the Fn14-positive invasive rim cells that cannot be safely removed by surgery. The proposal
that Fn14 may be an excellent drug delivery portal is supported by recent work by
Gurunathan et al. demonstrating that the steady-state Fn14 expression level in most cells
reflects a dynamic process, whereby Fn14 is constitutively synthesized, trafficked to the
plasma membrane, internalized, and degraded.122 In particular, constitutive Fn14 expression
and endocytosis may result in more efficient and sustained delivery of Fn14-targeted
therapeutics into the intracellular compartment.

Strategy #1: Fn14-targeted, fully-humanized recombinant fusion proteins with cytotoxic
activity

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Targeted toxins are a class of cancer therapeutics that bind to cell surface proteins (usually
plasma membrane-anchored receptors), become internalized via receptor-mediated
endocytosis, and release a cytotoxic payload.123 The cell surface proteins targeted by these
therapeutics are expressed at higher levels in tumors when compared to the corresponding
normal tissue type; consequently, they are often described as tumor-associated antigens
(TAAs). Targeted toxins are typically recombinant fusion proteins consisting of a targeting
moiety (e.g., a receptor ligand or receptor-specific mAb fragment; mAb-based targeted
toxins are generally referred to as ‘immunotoxins’) and a cell-killing moiety (e.g.,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE) or Cornynebacterium diphtheriae toxin (DT)).
Targeted toxins that use modified bacterial, fungal or plant toxins as their cell-killing moiety
all act on eukaryotic cells via inhibition of protein synthesis. A number of targeted toxins
have been developed for potential use in GB patients and several have advanced to human
clinical trials.124,125 Some of the “GB tumor-specific” cell surface proteins targeted by these
constructs include podoplanin,126 glycoprotein NMB,127 ephrin type-A receptor 2
(EphA2),128 urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR),129,130 transferrin receptor
(TfR),131 EGFR,132,133 the constitutively activated EGFRvIII deletion mutant,134
IL-4Rα,135,136 and IL-13Rα2.86,137,138 Bispecific constructs targeting two different GB cell
surface proteins have also been described.124,125,139 Only one targeted toxin, IL13PE38QQR (Cintredekin Besudotox), a fusion protein composed of human IL-13 and a
truncated, mutated version of PE, has been evaluated in a large Phase III randomized GB
clinical trial (the PRECISE trial).140 In this trial, IL13-PE38QQR was administered via CED
and efficacy was compared to Gliadel® wafer implantation. Although the targeted toxin was
well tolerated, there was no statistically significant improvement in survival compared with
the wafer. Several possible reasons for this outcome have been proposed, including the
likelihood that perhaps <50% of the patients enrolled in the trial may have actually harbored
IL-13Rα2-positive tumors,141 suboptimal catheter placement,86-89 and poor drug
distribution.89

Because Fn14 is frequently overexpressed in a wide variety of human primary cancers and
metastases (discussed above), it is a cell surface target for precision therapeutic development
for agents such as targeted toxins. In the context of GB therapy, Fn14 is perhaps a more
appealing target than many of the other cell surface receptors mentioned above because (i)
there is minimal expression in normal brain and most GB tumors are Fn14-positive
(∼70-85%), (ii) Fn14 overexpression has been confirmed in both the stationary and invasive
glioma cell populations, and (iii) Fn14 undergoes constitutive receptor internalization, which
could facilitate toxin delivery (discussed above). Also, in the context of choosing a
therapeutic strategy best suited for killing Fn14-positive invading glioma cells, it is of
interest to note that there is evidence that glioma cell migration/invasion and proliferation
are mutually exclusive processes; that is, migrating cells are not proliferating and vice versa
(the “Go or Grow” hypothesis).108,142,143 Thus, Fn14-targeted toxins may be particularly
useful for eradication of invasive glioma cells because targeted toxins, unlike traditional
chemotherapeutics or mAb-drug conjugates, can effectively kill quiescent, non-dividing
cells.123

Rosenblum and colleagues have developed several different Fn14-targeted toxins for cancer
therapy. The first generation constructs consisted of either the anti-Fn14 mAb ITEM4 (IT4)
or a humanized IT4 scFv fragment as the targeting moiety and the plant toxin gelonin as the
therapeutic payload.34,144,145 These agents are internalized by Fn14-positive cancer cells,
have cytotoxic activity when assayed on a large panel of cancer cell lines in vitro, and inhibit
xenograft tumor growth when delivered intravenously into immunodeficient mice.34,144,145
The most recently described Fn14-targeted toxins use either human TWEAK or a humanized
IT4 scFv fragment as the targeting moiety and the human pro-apoptotic serine protease
granzyme B (GrB) as the cell-killing component.31 These two fusion proteins, unlike all of
the targeted toxins employed in the GB clinical trials described to date, are completely
human constructs; accordingly, they are not likely to elicit immune responses in patients
(which would prevent retreatment).123 Both GrB-TWEAK and GrB-Fc-IT4 have been
shown to display potent cytotoxic activity on Fn14-positive cancer cells and can inhibit the
growth of established xenograft tumors in mice.31 It has not yet been reported whether these
GrB-based constructs inhibit glioma cell growth in vitro or in vivo. Since the therapeutic
goal is to eradicate the invading glioma cells, GB patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models
are best suited for the in vivo efficacy experiments since PDX tumors generally demonstrate
invasive intracranial growth in immunodeficient mice.146,147 Also, for these PDX
experiments, it would be desirable to compare two delivery strategies: (i) local
administration via new generation CED technology,85,148 and (ii) systemic administration in
conjunction with one of the new approaches under development for localized BBB
disruption, such as magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS).78,149,150

Nanotechnology and, in particular, the use of engineered nanocarriers to deliver imaging
agents, cytotoxic drugs, RNA-based therapeutics, or gene vectors to solid tumors, has the
potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and therapy.151-155 Many different
nanoparticulate drug delivery systems have been developed for cancer therapy, including
liposomes, polymeric NPs, micelles, dendrimers, and polymer-drug
conjugates.151,153,156,157 In general, NP-based chemotherapeutic drug delivery has several
advantages over conventional drug administration, including (i) preferential tumor
accumulation, which is largely mediated by unique structural alterations in the tumor
capillary and lymphatic vascular networks, resulting in a phenomenon known as the
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect,152,158-160 and (ii) sustained and in some
cases controllable drug release at the tumor site.151,152,157,161 These properties and others
allow systemically administered nanotherapeutics to achieve higher intratumoral drug
concentrations than their free drug counterparts, while simultaneously minimizing off-target
toxicity in normal tissues, which can translate into improved therapeutic efficacy. One
strategy that has been employed by numerous groups in order to further increase tumor cellspecific cytotoxicity is to decorate the surface of therapeutic nanocarriers with peptides,
polypeptide ligands or mAbs recognizing molecules overexpressed on the cancer cell plasma
membrane.160,162,163 This approach is frequently referred to as ‘active tumor-targeting’ to
distinguish it from the ‘passive tumor-targeting’ mechanism that occurs via the EPR
effect.160

Several nanomedicines for non-CNS cancers have been approved by the FDA for clinical
use, including Doxil® (also known as Caelyx®), a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified
liposomal formulation of the anthracycline doxorubicin, and Abraxane®, an albumin-bound
NP formulation of the mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel.152-155,157,161 These formulations are less
toxic than their free drug counterparts but only modestly improve patient overall
survival,152,154 most likely due to poor penetration through tumor tissue.65,164 Indeed, it has
been reported that the penetration depth of intravenously administered Doxil® in lung
cancer xenograft tissue is only 8-16 μm (1-2 cell layers) beyond the tumor capillary
endothelium.165

Numerous research groups are developing nanotechnology-based biomaterials that can be
used for improved imaging and treatment of advanced brain cancers, including GB.166-168 In
regard to the design of therapeutic, biodegradable nanocarriers for GB patient use, the issue
of poor nanomedicine tissue penetration discussed above is of particular concern, since
perhaps the best strategy is to deliver the therapeutic particles into the invasive rim at the
time of surgery in order to potentially reach and kill the unresected glioma cells embedded
within the normal brain parenchyma (Figure 5A). As mentioned above, CED can “infuse”
therapeutic agents, including NPs,94,169,170 into brain tissue but there is still limited drug
distribution due in part to the BPB; accordingly, several approaches have been pursued to
develop nanocarriers with enhanced brain-penetrating capacity. These approaches include
NP surface alterations such as (i) high density PEGylation to minimize non-specific binding
to brain ECM,171-173 and (ii) covalent conjugation of the tissue penetration peptide
iRGD.174-176 Also, Zhou et al. reported that relatively small (∼70 nm) nanoparticles exhibit
enhanced ability to distribute in the brain following CED if they are stored in trehalose to
reduce particle aggregation.170 There is also a significant amount of research underway
evaluating whether nanomedicines engineered for ‘active tumor-targeting’ may be the best
formulations for GB patient therapy. Surface modified NPs have been designed to recognize
many of the same “GB tumor-specific” cell surface proteins describe above for targeted
toxin therapy, including TfR,177,178 EGFR,150 EGFRvIII,179 IL-13Rα2,180 and Fn14 (see
below).

In 2015, Schneider et al. reported the successful engineering of polystyrene NPs with both
brain-penetrating ability and an active tumor-targeting function.173 In this study, a dense low
molecular weight PEG surface coating was employed in order to increase NP penetration
into brain tissue and the NPs were targeted to Fn14-positive glioma cells by attaching the
Fn14 mAb IT4 to the PEG chains. These Fn14-targeted, brain-penetrating NPs were able to
(i) selectively bind to recombinant Fn14 but not brain ECM proteins in surface plasmon
resonance (BiaCore) assays, (ii) exhibit increased association with Fn14-positive cells in
comparison to Fn14-negative cells, and (iii) rapidly diffuse within brain tissue, even though
the PEGylated surface was decorated with mAb molecules. In addition, when administered
intracranially, the Fn14-targeted, penetrating NPs showed improved tumor cell colocalization in mice bearing human GB xenografts compared to non-targeted, penetrating
NPs. It is anticipated that NP formulations of this type might prove more successful that
“conventional” NPs in delivering chemotherapy drugs to the invading glioma cell population
while sparing normal healthy brain cells (Figure 5B). Additional experimentation is required
to determine if the knowledge gained in this initial proof-of-concept study can be translated

be tested for therapeutic efficacy in invasive PDX and transgenic rodent models of human
GB.

Conclusions

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

GB is a lethal disease, in large part due to the highly invasive nature of malignant glioma
cells, which limits complete surgical removal and dosing of adjuvant therapies due to the
involvement of functioning brain tissue. The proliferation of these cells within the normal
brain parenchyma is the basis for tumor recurrence. In 2003, Tran et al. reported for the first
time that the TWEAK receptor Fn14 was highly expressed in GB tissue specimens in
comparison to non-neoplastic brain tissue.27 Since that time, numerous reports have
confirmed and extended these results;15,95-98 in addition, studies have revealed that Fn14 is
overexpressed in invasive glioma cells in vivo15,107 (Figure 3) and that manipulating Fn14
expression levels in glioma cells can impact invasion capacity.15,109 Fn14 gene mutations
have not yet been identified in GB tissue (COSMIC v72); therefore, Fn14 overexpression,
which likely leads to constitutive Fn14 signaling,117 may be the primary Fn14 alteration in
this cancer type. Taken together, these studies have identified Fn14 as a promising potential
cell surface target for GB therapeutics. The list of possible strategies that could be
considered for the development of effective Fn14-targeted therapeutic agents for GB patients
is somewhat limited because Fn14 is not a protein kinase and Fn14-specific mAbs
frequently exhibit agonist activity,36,119,120 which could potentially promote glioma cell
invasive activity. Here, we have described two distinct therapeutic strategies in preclinical
development that are designed to exploit glioma cell surface-specific Fn14 overexpression in
order to deliver either humanized cytotoxins31 or chemotherapeutic drug-loaded
nanoparticles173 to malignant, invading glioma cells while sparing healthy neurons and glial
cells. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate whether these therapeutic strategies can
be advanced beyond the preclinical stage and ultimately make a significant impact on GB
patient survival.

Figure 1. The TWEAK/Fn14 signaling dyad

Author Manuscript

Both membrane-anchored TWEAK and soluble TWEAK monomers assemble into trimers.
TWEAK binding to the Fn14 extracellular domain promotes Fn14 trimerization and binding
of TRAF adaptor proteins to the Fn14 cytoplasmic tail. This interaction triggers the
activation of various downstream protein kinases, only some of which are shown here, and
signaling cascades, including the classical (c) and alternative (a) NF-κB pathways, resulting
in transcription factor binding to genomic DNA and the expression of numerous TWEAKinducible genes, including Fn14.15,16 TWEAK:Fn14 engagement stimulates various cellular
responses such as apoptosis, migration, and differentiation.

Figure 2. Analysis of Fn14 mRNA expression in GB molecular subtypes

Author Manuscript

Fn14 (queried as TNFRSF12A) mRNA expression data in 195 GB tumors was downloaded
as z-scores from cbioportal.org.102,103 Z-Scores were computed by cbioportal.org relative to
the expression distribution of each gene in tumors that are diploid for this gene. Patients
used in this analysis were limited to the provisional TCGA dataset.47 The provisional dataset
using the Affymetrix U113 microarray platform is the only GB dataset with annotation for
classical, mesenchymal, neural, and proneural expression clusters on cbioportal.org. Patient/
sample sets for each expression cluster were plotted as box and whisker plots. Classical n=
54, Mesenchymal n=56, Neural n=29, and Proneural n=56. Whiskers of the plot map the
maximum and minimum z-score for each expression cluster. Bar in box represents the mean
value for the Fn14 z-score of each group. Top and bottoms of the box represent the 25th and
75th percentile, respectively, of the Fn14 z-score values for each group. Each of the mean
expression values are significantly different from one another (p< 0.05) as determined using
unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed).

Figure 3. Analysis of Fn14 protein expression in normal brain and GB invasive rim tissue

Non-neoplastic brain tissue from a male 45-yr-old epilepsy patient (panel A) and right
frontal tumor tissue from a female 59-yr-old GB patient (panel B) was immunostained using
an anti-Fn14 rabbit mAb (EPR3179; Abcam). The GB image shows the invasive rim region,
with the Fn14-positive glioma cells (brown stain, several positive cells are denoted with
arrows) interspersed with normal brain tissue. Scale bar = 200 um.

TWEAK:Fn14 binding and Fn14 overexpression stimulate similar intracellular signaling
cascades and downstream cellular responses. Some of the pathways and molecules that play
a role in Fn14-mediated glioma cell migration, invasion and resistance to chemotherapeutic
and pro-apoptotic agents are shown here.

Figure 5. Adjuvant therapy for GB patients using engineered nanoparticles

Author Manuscript

(A) MRI images obtained from a female 59-yr-old GB patient before and after surgical
resection are shown. Therapeutic nanoparticles delivered into the invasive rim region at the
time of surgery using advanced CED technology could potentially reach the invasive glioma
cells outside the immediate resection margin and deliver their cytotoxic payload. (B)
Conventional, drug-loaded NPs without a specialized surface coating penetrate poorly
through brain extracellular space after CED (normal brain cells indicated with white circles
containing black lines; catheter is indicated using dark black V) and Fn14 targeting is
restricted to those glioma cells close to the catheter entry point (white circles; Fn14
molecules indicated with rectangles). In contrast, NPs engineered for enhanced brainpenetrating capacity move deeper into the adjacent brain parenchyma and surface decoration
with an Fn14 targeting moiety may increase NP binding to the invasive glioma cells.
