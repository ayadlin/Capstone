BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiation is becoming the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced
rectal cancer. However, since the introduction of total mesorectal excision (TME), local recurrence rates have been
reduced significantly, and some patients can be spared from potentially toxic over treatment. The current study was
designed to assess the factors that predict recurrence in an institutional series of patients with rectal cancer who had
clinical T2 lymph node-positive (cT2Nþ) tumors or cT3N0/Nþ tumors and underwent radical surgery without receiving preoperative chemoradiation. METHODS: Between November 1997 and November 2008, the authors’ multidisciplinary group preoperatively staged 398 patients with rectal cancer by using endorectal ultrasonography and/or
magnetic resonance imaging. The analysis included 152 consecutive patients with cT2Nþ, cT3N0, or cT3Nþ rectal
cancer who underwent TME without receiving preoperative chemoradiation. Macroscopic assessment of the mesorectal excision and circumferential resection margins were determined. Factors potentially related to local recurrence
(LR), disease-free survival (DFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed. RESULTS: After a median followup of 39 months, the 5-year actuarial LR, DFS, and CSS rates were 9.5%, 65.4%, and 77.8%, respectively, for the whole
group. Threatened mesorectal fascia at preoperative staging was the only independent preoperative factor that predicted a higher risk for LR (P ¼ .007), shorter DFS (P ¼ .007), and shorter CSS (P ¼ .05). In particular, the 5-year LR
rates for patients with and without preoperative threatened circumferential resection margins were 19.4% and 5.4%,
respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that patients with rectal cancer clinically staged as
T3N0/Nþ or T2Nþ with a free margin >2 mm from mesorectal fascia may undergo TME alone, avoiding over treatC 2011 American Cancer Society.

Patients with localized rectal cancer generally receive preoperative radiation. Several trials using short-course preoperative radiation alone1,2 or concomitant chemoradiation (CRT)3 have challenged the statement of the 1990 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference recommending that all patients with rectal cancer who have T2 tumors and
positive lymph node status (Nþ) or T3 tumors should receive postoperative CRT.4 Short-course preoperative radiotherapy increases local control even when patients undergo total mesorectal excision (TME).1,2 Neoadjuvant CRT, as an alternative option, produces better local control and less acute and chronic toxicity compared with postoperative treatment.3
However, 2 important concepts have been phased into clinical practice in the last 20 years. The first is TME as standard
surgery for rectal cancer, which has produced a significant reduction in local recurrence (LR) rates.5 The second concept
derives from the use of endorectal ultrasonography (ERUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as more accurate preoperative staging tools that may improve our ability to select patients for neoadjuvant treatment.6,7

Rectal Cancer Treated With TME Alone/Frasson et al

Currently, preoperative staging of rectal cancer
(clinical tumor and lymph node classification [cTN]) is
considered essential for the selection of patients for surgery and neoadjuvant therapy in a multidisciplinary team
approach.8,9 Patients with bulky tumors that involve adjacent structures (cT4) or those who have tumors that
threaten or invade the mesorectal fascia are selected for
preoperative therapy.10,11 However, patients with less
advanced tumors may undergo TME alone and avoid
potentially toxic over treatment. Nevertheless, the characteristics of patients who have a low risk of LR and may not
require neoadjuvant treatment have not been clearly
defined.
The objective of the current study was to assess the
influence of preoperative and pathologic variables on
oncologic outcome for an institutional cohort of 152 consecutive patients who had rectal cancer fully staged with
ERUS and/or MRI as cT2Nþ or cT3N0/Nþ and who
underwent TME only without receiving CRT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Since its inception in 1992, the Multidisciplinary Colorectal Cancer Group at Valencia University Hospital
Clinic has maintained a database of all patients with cancer who undergo surgery within the department. Demographic, treatment, pathologic, and outcome data from
>3500 patients with colorectal cancer were recorded prospectively. Of these, 398 of 742 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma (within 15 cm of the anal verge) were staged
preoperatively by ERUS and/or MRI. All of these patients
underwent surgery between November 1997 and November 2008. Of these, 350 patients had cT3 or cT2Nþ disease, and 190 of 350 patients did not receive preoperative
radiotherapy. Thirty-six patients had metastasis, and 2
patients underwent palliative resection, leaving 152
patients with cT3 or cT2Nþ rectal cancer who were preoperatively staged by imaging studies and who underwent
surgery without receiving neoadjuvant CRT. Our study is
based on these 152 patients (Fig. 1).
Approval was obtained from the institutional ethical
board to collect and review data. All decisions relating to
neoadjuvant therapy were made at a multidisciplinary
team meeting. At our unit, indications for preoperative
CRT include advanced cT3 and cT4 tumors with highrisk factors for LR (involved circumferential resection
margin [CRM] on preoperative staging, venous infiltration, peritoneal involvement, or significant lymph node
involvement).12

Preoperative Staging
Cancer localization was divided into tumors of the low
rectum (0-6 cm from the anal verge), the medium rectum
(7-10 cm from the anal verge), and the high rectum (1115 cm from the anal verge). ERUS was performed on an
outpatient basis using a Bruel&Kjaer model 3535 ultrasound scanner (B&K Medical Systems, Herlev, Denmark) with an endoluminal 7 to 10 MHz multifrequency
transducer (model 1850; B&K Medical Systems). Realtime dynamic interpretation was performed. In addition,
the examination was printed and recorded in digital format for subsequent review if necessary. ERUS staging of
tumors was performed by using the ultrasound TN
(uTN) classification described by Hildebrandt and Feifel.13 Our ERUS institutional protocol included CRM
determination in the anterior tumors (in predominantly

3119

Original Article

posterior or posterolateral tumors, the CRM was not evaluated, because there are no neighboring structures that
enabled assessment of the CRM).14
MRI evaluation was performed with a 1.5-Telsa,
magnetic resonance whole-body imager (Signa EchoSpeed Plus with EXCITE; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis) with a maximal gradient capacity of 33 mT/m
and an 8-element pelvic phased array coil using the scan
technique initially described by Brown et al.15
At our unit, ERUS and MRI were introduced in
1997 and 2001, respectively. For the purpose of the current study, when preoperative staging results were discordant between MRI and ERUS, we assumed that the
worst tumor classification, lymph node status, and CRM
status were true. Preoperative CRM status was classified as
free, threatened (free margin 2 mm), or affected.
Surgical Technique
During the study period, all patients with rectal cancer
underwent surgery exclusively performed by 5 fully
trained colorectal staff surgeons. Therefore, a uniform
surgical technique has been used at our institution since
1992. A TME technique was used for all tumors that
were located <10 cm from the anal verge. For lesions
that were located in the upper rectum, patients underwent subtotal mesorectal excision, and all mesorectal
tissue down to at least 5 cm below the tumor was
excised. Further details of the surgical technique have
been published previously.16
Pathologic Assessment
Histopathologic reports included TNM staging, CRM
status, and cellular differentiation. The CRM was classified as affected when the tumor was within 1 mm of the
CRM according to criteria established by Quirke et al.17
Focal CRM involvement was classified in this study as
positive CRM margin status. Macroscopic assessment of
the quality of the mesorectum was introduced in October
199818 according to criteria initially described by
Quirke19 and then formally defined by Nagtegaal et al20
and is reported as complete, nearly complete, or incomplete mesorectal excision.
Postoperative Treatment and Follow-Up
Our institutional policy during this study was that all
patients who had stage III disease and patients who had
stage II with high-risk features, such as pathologic T4
(pT4) tumors, perforation, vascular invasion, or perineural invasion, should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. From

3120

November 1997 to June 2004, our standard treatment
was 5-florouracil and leucovorin according to the Mayo
Clinic schedule. After June 2004, postoperative chemotherapy was based on oxaliplatin-containing regimens.
Patients aged >75 years who had comorbidities or who
did not fully recover 6 weeks after surgery were not considered candidates for adjuvant treatment.
Measured oncologic outcomes included LR and
overall recurrence rates. LR was defined as the presence
of any anastomotic, pelvic, or perineal tumor documented by proctoscopic, radiologic, or histopathologic
examination. Distant recurrence was defined as evidence
of recurrent disease in any other location. Calculation
of LR rates included patients who developed LR only
and patients who developed both LR and distant recurrence. Overall recurrence was considered when patients
developed either locoregional or distant recurrence.
Patients were followed by serial clinical examination
and carcinoembryonic antigen assessment every 3
months during the first year, every 6 months during the
second year, and annually thereafter. Thoracoabdominal
computed tomography scanning was performed every 6
months for the first 2 years. Colonoscopy was performed after 1 year and 3 to 5 years thereafter, depending on individual patient risk. If recurrence was
suspected, then further diagnostic methods were used as
required. The oncologist within the Multidisciplinary
Colorectal Cancer Group acted as an independent observer to confirm the presence of recurrent disease.

Statistical Analysis
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 15.0; Chicago, Ill, USA) was used for data management and statistical analyses. Categorical variables were
compared using the chi-square test and the Fisher exact
test. Continuous outcomes were compared using a parametric t test, (analysis of variance); and the nonparametric
Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as
appropriate, was used to determine significance. The univariate influence of prognostic factors on LR, disease-free
survival (DFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank
(Mantel-Cox) test. A multivariate logistic regression
model was constructed to investigate independent predictors of LR, DFS, and CSS. Stepwise regression methods
(variable inclusion criteria if P < .1) were used for the
above models. P values < .05 were considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
One hundred fifty-two patients were included and analyzed (Fig. 1). Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics of the study population are listed in Table 1.
A comparison between preoperative combined
ERUS and MRI results (clinical classification [cT and
cN]) and pathologic classification (pT and pN) is
reported in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Accuracy of the T
and N definition indicated over staging in 27.7% of cT3
tumors and in 45.7% of cNþ tumors. Conversely, only
21.8% of cN0 tumors were considered pNþ. Pathologic
staging did not differ between cancer locations (uppermiddle rectum vs lower rectum; data not shown).
Patients who had the CRM categorized as potentially free at preoperative staging were confirmed as margin-free in 91.8% of the cases at the pathologic
assessment. However, when this margin was not assessed
or when it was defined as threatened, it was identified as
affected at pathologic staging in 33.3% and 44.4% of
patients, respectively. The pathologic assessment identified the CRM as free in 127 patients (83.6%) and affected
in the remaining 25 patients (16.4%). Of these, 9 patients
had a free preoperative CRM, 8 patients had a threatened
preoperative CRM, and 8 patients were not evaluable.
The proportion of patients receiving adjuvant treatment
did not differ between those with free versus involved
margins (data not shown).
The median follow-up was 39 months (range, 12152 months). Eleven patients (7.2%) developed an LR at
a median of 15 months after surgery (range, 4-48
months). The 5-year actuarial LR, DFS, and CSS rates
were 9.1%, 65.4%, and 77.8%, respectively, for the whole
group.
An univariate analysis of the different preoperative,
surgical, and pathologic factors related to oncologic outcome is provided in Table 4. Preoperative CRM status

in a multivariate Cox regression analysis, only an involved

DISCUSSION
Our current study suggests that patients who have rectal
cancer clinically staged as cT3N0/Nþor cT2Nþ with a
free margin >2 mm from mesorectal fascia can undergo
TME alone with a risk of LR <6% and can avoid over
treatment with preoperative CRT.
Cancer

July 15, 2011

The strategy for rectal cancer treatment has changed
radically over the last 20 years. In 1990, a US National
Institute of Health Consensus Conference recommended
postoperative CRT for patients with stage II and III rectal
cancer.4 With the implementation of preoperative imaging, that indication shifted to neoadjuvant therapy; and,
currently, patients with clinical stage II and III rectal cancer receive preoperative CRT as standard therapy, even in
the TME era.21 However, this policy is associated with
potential toxicity, early postoperative complications,22,23
and long-term dysfunction. In particular, preoperative
radiotherapy is a risk factor for fecal incontinence and, in
men, sexual dysfunction after TME.24,25
The unselective receipt of preoperative radiotherapy
by all patients may result in over treatment for many of
them. In the Norwegian TME project, only 5% of
patients who had an uninvolved CRM developed an LR;
and, assuming optimistically that radiotherapy would
reduce the LR rate by 50%, the receipt of radiotherapy by
all patients would have resulted in over treatment in 97%
of patients with clear margins.26 Therefore, the appropriate selection for neoadjuvant therapy of patients with
high-risk features for LR is a critical point, and improvement in preoperative staging will definitely help with
making these decisions. Rectal cancer staging has evolved
from ERUS in the 1990s to MRI, used either alone or in
combination with ERUS, in the last 10 years, and our current series reflects this evolution. We currently use both
ERUS and MRI to stage patients with rectal cancer before
discussing the therapeutic approach at a multidisciplinary
team meeting.
However, the low accuracy of preoperative staging is
an issue to be considered. With ERUS, approximately

3123

Original Article

30% of T3 tumors and 48% of Nþ tumor are overstaged.6 With MRI, the accuracy varies between 65% and
85% for tumor staging and between 39% and 95% for
lymph node staging, and there is a considerable difference
between studies and radiologists.27 In our series, we noted
an accuracy of 70.1% for classifying T3 tumors and
61.2% for classifying lymph node status. This lower percentage may have been because we considered as true the
worst staging results from MRI and ERUS, which raised
the risk of over staging. In fact, using only ERUS, the accuracy previously reported by our group for classifying T3
tumors was 82.4%.28
Another key factor in estimating the risk of LR and
systemic recurrence in rectal cancer is the CRM assessment, whether clinical or pathologic. In a meta-analysis
that included more than 17,500 patients, pathologic
CRM involvement was the most significant predictor of
oncologic outcome.29 The CRM status may be useful not
only in predicting prognosis but also in selecting patients
for neoadjuvant therapy. Moreover, MRI can predict
whether the surgical resection margins will be clear or
affected by cancer.8 In our experience, preoperative CRM
status also can be determined by ERUS in anterior rectal
tumors.14 The Norwegian TME project demonstrated
that all patients who had a pCRM <2 mm should be considered for neoadjuvant treatment. Our current study
confirms the importance of either clinical or pathologic
CRM involvement.30 Similarly, Burton et al recommend
the preoperative assessment of CRM as a tool with which
to select patients for neoadjuvant therapy.9 This strategy
leads to a low pCRM-positive rate, but data on oncologic
follow-up were not reported.
Regarding the use of neoadjuvant therapy for
patients with positive lymph nodes assessed by ERUS and
MRI, the risk of over treatment is even higher because of
the low accuracy of both methods. Furthermore, Cecil et
al have demonstrated that TME allows the resection of all
mesorectal lymph nodes, resulting in good prognosis,
even without preoperative CRT.31 In our study, the preoperative determination of N status had low accuracy and
was not associated with LR, whereas pathologic N status
was an independent predictor of DFS and CSS but not of
LR.
Although the current study was an institutional retrospective series with prospectively collected data, the
high quality of the TME surgery performed by a small
group of colorectal surgeons (proven by the low rate of
incomplete mesorectum) and the precise strategy adopted
by a multidisciplinary team strengthen our results. To our

3124

knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a strong
correlation between clinical CRM status and oncologic
results.
TME and multidisciplinary team discussions with
high-quality imaging are 2 key elements in the selective
neoadjuvant strategy for the treatment of rectal cancer.
Our results emphasize the value of preoperative CRM
assessment and the need to improve the accuracy of determining lymph node status to select patients for preoperative treatment. In conclusion, our data suggest that
preoperative CRT may be unnecessary in patients who
have cT3 and cT2Nþ rectal cancer if the clinical CRM is
free and if no other adverse factors for LR are present, thus
avoiding over treatment for a large number of patients. In
consequence, the widely accepted practice of indicating
neoadjuvant therapy for all cT3 or cNþ rectal cancers
should be re-evaluated in large prospective trials.
