dvanced transitional cell carcinoma is a moderately chemosensitive neoplasm. The methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin,
and cisplatin (M-VAC) regimen, long considered the standard initial
regimen for advanced disease, has been replaced by the gemcitabine
plus cisplatin (GC) doublet based on a phase 3 trial that compared
M-VAC with GC and demonstrated comparable activity with a somewhat improved toxicity profile favoring GC.1
Over the last 15 years, several new agents and combination regimens have been tested in advanced urothelial cancer. Many of these
agents, including paclitaxel, pemetrexed, and docetaxel, have exhibited activity against advanced transitional cell carcinoma, although
none of the doublets/triple combinations studied to date have
demonstrated improved survival compared with the M-VAC regimen.2–5 Another therapeutic dilemma is that patients who have
advanced urothelial caner may have impairment in renal function
because of age, comorbid conditions, and/or disease-related factors
that limit the utility of cisplatin-based regimens.
Gemcitabine has demonstrated single-agent activity in urothelial cancer with response rates that range from 24% to 28%.6,7 At the

time this report was written, pemetrexed disodium
was a new, novel, multitargeted antifolate compound
that had demonstrated antitumor activity in the preclinical setting against a variety of solid tumors,
including bladder cancers.8 The significant hematologic toxicity associated with the early use of this
agent was evaluated extensively; and, subsequently,
patients were supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12, which led to a marked improvement in
drug tolerance.9 Paz-Ares et al. conducted a phase 2
study of pemetrexed disodium in advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Pemetrexed disodium was administered as a 10-minute infusion of
600 mg/m2 for the first 6 patients then 500 mg/m2
for all additional patients. In the preliminary report
of 17 evaluable patients, 6 patients (35%) obtained a
partial response (PR). It is noteworthy that the trial
was performed without prophylactic vitamin supplementation, and there were 2 treatment-related
deaths.10
Given the broad antitumor activity of both gemcitabine and pemetrexed disodium and their potential use in patients with compromised renal function,
an evaluation of these agents given in combination
was undertaken. Preclinical work demonstrated cytotoxic synergy when gemcitabine exposure preceded
pemetrexed disodium in human colon cancer cells
and bladder cancer in vitro.11,12 Adjei et al. performed a Phase I trial of the combination using a
Day 1 and 8 schedule and demonstrated responses
in a variety of epithelial cancers.11 On the basis of
the demonstrated single-agent activity of these
agents and the potential for developing an active
nonplatinum-containing doublet, we conducted a
phase 2 trial of combined gemcitabine and pemetrexed in patients with advanced urothelial cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma (or mixed histologies that contained a component of transitional cell carcinoma)
of the urothelium with evidence of progressive, bidimensionally measurable, regional or metastatic disease. Patients with a history of prior malignancy
were eligible provided they were treated with curative
intent and had been disease free for the period considered appropriate for cure of the specific cancer.
Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
from 0 to 2 at entry and may not have received prior
systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease.
Patients may have received prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy if their treatment ended >1

year before registration, and they had to be at least
4 weeks out from major surgery. Adequate renal and
hepatic function was required with a calculated creatinine clearance 45 mL/minute based on the standard
Cockroft and Gault formula, an aspartate aminotransferase level 3 times the upper limit of normal, and a
bilirubin level 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.
Adequate bone marrow reserve was mandated with a
requirement for granulocytes 1500 mm3 and a platelet count 100,000 mm3 at entry. Patients with uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmias or American Heart
Association Class III or IV heart disease were excluded
as were patients with evidence of clinically significant
(by physical examination or plain film) third-space
fluid collections (pleural effusions, ascites). Each site
was required to have approval of this clinical trial by a
local human investigations committee in accord with
an assurance filed with and approved by the Department of Health and Human Services. All patients provided written informed consent before registration
onto this study.
Patients received 1000 lg of vitamin B12 intramuscularly and started folic acid 400 lg daily within
7 days before protocol therapy. Injections of vitamin
B12 were repeated every 9 weeks, and folic acid
400 lg daily both were administered until 3 weeks
postprotocol therapy.
Doses of chemotherapy were based on actual
weights, and body surface area was capped empirically at 2.2 m2. On Day 1 of therapy, pemetrexed disodium 500 mg/m2 was administered intravenously
over 10 minutes followed 60 minutes later by gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes.
The dose of gemcitabine was repeated on Day 8, and
therapy was repeated every 3 weeks for a maximum
of 6 cycles.
Standard dose modifications for hematologic and
nonhematologic toxicity for both regimens were stipulated. Growth factor support use was in accord
with the American Society of Clinical Oncology
guidelines.13
Before study entry, all patients underwent physical examination, standard laboratory measurements,
and computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Tumor measurements were obtained every other cycle.
Tumor responses were analyzed by using
Response Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST). National
Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (Version 2)
were used to analyze toxicity. Patients who had
objective responses or stable disease were continued
on therapy for a maximum of 6 cycles.
The study was designed to assess the objective
response rate and toxicity of the combination of

Pemetrexed+Gemcitabine in Bladder CA/Dreicer et al.

pemetrexed disodium and gemcitabine. The primary
endpoint was the proportion of patients responding
to treatment, as measured using RECIST solid tumor
response criteria. The trial was designed with the
assumption that this doublet would be worthy of further study if the combination had a true response
rate of 65%. Alternatively, a response rate of 45%
would not be of interest. A 2-stage accrual plan was
used with the first stage planned for 21 eligible
patients, although accrual was planned to continue
while response assessment of patients in the first
stage was ongoing. If 10 of 21 eligible patients in
the first stage responded, then accrual would continue to 41 eligible patients.

RESULTS
Forty-six patients from 18 ECOG institutions were
enrolled from April 2004 until October 2005. Two
patients never started protocol therapy, and the
remaining 44 patients were eligible and evaluable for
response and toxicity. The decision rule regarding
early stopping was not used, because study accrual
was complete before response information was available for the first 21 patients.
Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1. All
44 eligible patients had tumors that were pure or
predominantly transitional cell carcinoma. The bladder was the primary site of disease in 34 patients.
Eighteen patients underwent prior cystectomy, and
12 patients underwent nephroureterectomy. Three
patients (7%) had received perioperative (adjuvant or
neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. According to the risk
factor status defined by Bajorin et al., 22 patients
(50%) had good-risk status, 21 patients (48%) had
intermediate-risk status, and 1 patient (2%) had
poor-risk status.14
The median number of pemetrexed/gemcitabine
cycles administered was 4.5 (range, 1–6 cycles).
Twenty-seven percent of patients came off treatment
for progressive disease, 23% of patients came off
treatment for toxicity, and 39% of patients completed
all 6 planned cycles of therapy. Forty of 44 patients
required at least 1 modification of their therapy
regimen.

Toxicity
Toxicity data were available for all 44 patients. There
were 2 therapy-related deaths: One patient died of
febrile neutropenia-related sepsis, and a second
patient died of an infection in a nonneutropenic setting. Thirty-three patients (75%) experienced grade
3 neutropenia, 5 patients (11%) experienced febrile
neutropenia, 3 patients (7%) experienced grade 3

thrombocytopenia, and 6 patients (14%) experienced
grade 3 anemia. Clinically significant (grade 3 and 4)
nonhematologic toxicity included 7 patients with fatigue; 3 patients each with transaminitis, anorexia,
dehydration, and nausea; and 2 patients each with
hyperglycemia and hypotension.

Response
Thirty-eight patients were assessable for response to
therapy, and 6 patients were deemed unevaluable (2
patients died before evaluation, 1 patient refused
evaluation, 1 patient received nonprotocol therapy
before evaluation, and 2 patients had incomplete
baseline or follow-up information). Two patients
obtained a complete response (CR), and 12 patients
obtained a PR for an overall response rate of 31.8%
(90% confidence interval [CI], 20.4%–45.2%). At the
time of this report, 34 patients (77%) had progressed,
and 6 patients (14%) were alive and progression-free.
The median time to progression was 5.8 months
(95% CI, 3–7.7 months) (Fig. 1). The median overall
survival was 13.4 months (95% CI, 8.8–16.1 months)
(Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
For fit patients with acceptable renal function, cisplatin-based multiagent chemotherapy has been the
standard of care for more than 2 decades. The MVAC regimen gradually has been replaced by the
combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine, which has

demonstrated similar efficacy with a somewhat better toxicity profile.15
For unfit patients or for patients with compromised renal function, various agents and combinations have been used, including paclitaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine, with some evidence of clinical benefit but with lingering concerns that these
agents failed to provide antitumor activity similar to
that provided by cisplatin-based treatment.16,17 Given
the relatively high percentage of patients with
advanced urothelial cancer who are considered unfit
or who have some degree of compromised renal
function, the need to develop effective alternatives to
cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains a priority.
Three trials have evaluated the role of pemetrexed as a single agent in urothelial cancer. The first
study, which was done without the use of vitamin
supplementation, involved 33 previously untreated
patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Patients
received pemetrexed at doses from 500 to 600 mg/
m2 every 21 days. On an intent-to-treat basis, 29% of
patients (95% CI, 14%–48%) achieved an objective
response. There were 3 early deaths, which the
authors believed may have been caused in part by
the lack of vitamin supplementation.10 Two studies
evaluated the role of pemetrexed in previously treated patients. Sweeney et al. performed a multi-institutional phase 2 trial of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2
every 21 days) with vitamin replacement in patients
with advanced urothelial cancer. All patients had
received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen with disease
progression after adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment
(disease progression within 12 months) or in the
metastatic setting. Of the 45 evaluable patients, there
was an overall response rate of 28%, and 3 patients
(6%) achieved a CR. The reported median overall survival was 9.6 months, and therapy was well tolerated.3 Galasky et al. treated 13 patients in the

second-line setting and observed an overall response
rate of 8%.18
The combination of gemcitabine and pemetrexed
was evaluated in a multicenter phase 2 trial in
patients with advanced urothelial cancer who had
not received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.
Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 was administered on Days
1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2
was administered on Day 8 90 minutes after the
gemcitabine administration, and all patients received
vitamin supplementation. Of the 47 evaluable
patients, 3 patients obtained a CR, and 10 patients
obtained a PR for an overall response rate of 28%
(95% CI, 16%–43%). The median response duration
was 11.2 months, and the median overall survival
was 10.3 months. Febrile neutropenia was observed
in 17% of patients, and neutropenic sepsis was
observed in 3% of patients, including 1 patient who
died secondary to neutropenic sepsis.19
The objective of this study was to evaluate the
antitumor activity of the combination of pemetrexed
and gemcitabine with the hope of developing an
active regimen for patients who are not optimal candidates for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Although
our dose/schedule was somewhat different from that
tested by von der Maase and colleagues,19 we observed a similar overall response rate and toxicity
profile, with moderate-to-significant myelosuppression and with 1 patient death secondary to neutropenic sepsis. The observed median survivals from both
these trials are in the 10 to 13 month range, which
overlaps a large number of other combination regimens described in the phase 2 setting.
Twenty years of experience with cisplatin-based
combination chemotherapy has reinforced our
appreciation that advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is a chemotherapy-sensitive
neoplasm. Unfortunately, despite the introduction of
a host of cytotoxic agents with single-agent activity,
efforts to dose intensify, and the use of doublet and

Pemetrexed+Gemcitabine in Bladder CA/Dreicer et al.

triplet regimens, we have made little additional progress in improving patient outcomes. Trials of novel
targeted agents have come late to urothelial cancer
but are underway. Because the biology of urothelial
carcinoma, like that of renal cancer, provides many
attractive targets that are amenable to these agents,
there is reason for cautious optimism that real progress in the management of this disease may be
forthcoming in the near term.
The combination of pemetrexed and gemcitabine
has activity in advanced urothelial cancer but at a
significant cost in terms of toxicity. Further development of this doublet in urothelial cancer seems
unwarranted.
