ABSTRACT
Mice lines homozygous negative for one of the four DNA mismatch repair (MMR)
genes (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6) were generated as models for MMR deficient
(MMR-D) diseases. Clinically, hereditary forms of MMR-D include Lynch syndrome
(characterized by a germline MMR gene defect) and constitutional MMR-D, the biallelic
form. MMR-D knockout mice may be representative for both diseases. Here, we aimed
at characterizing the MLH1-/- model focusing on tumor-immune microenvironment and
identification of coding microsatellite mutations in lymphomas and gastrointestinal
tumors (GIT).
All tumors showed microsatellite instability (MSI) in non-coding mononucleotide
markers. Mutational profiling of 26 coding loci in MSI+ GIT and lymphomas revealed
instability in half of the microsatellites, two of them (Rfc3 and Rasal2) shared
between both entities. MLH1-/- tumors of both entities displayed a similar phenotype
(high CD71, FasL, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 expression). Additional immunofluorescence
verified the tumors’ natural immunosuppressive character (marked CD11b/CD200R
infiltration). Vice versa, CD3+ T cells as well as immune checkpoints molecules were
detectable, indicative for an active immune microenvironment. For functional analysis,
a permanent cell line from an MLH1-/- GIT was established. The newly developed
MLH1-/- A7450 cells exhibit stable in vitro growth, strong invasive potential and
heterogeneous drug response. Moreover, four additional MSI target genes (Nktr1,
C8a, Taf1b, and Lig4) not recognized in the primary were identified in this cell line.
Summing up, molecular and immunological mechanisms of MLH1-/- driven
carcinogenesis correlate well with clinical features of MMR-D. MLH1-/- knockout mice
combine characteristics of Lynch syndrome and constitutional MMR-D, making them
suitable models for preclinical research aiming at MMR-D related diseases.

Lynch Syndrome (LS, formerly designated as hereditary
non-polyposis colorectal cancer) is the most common and
MMR-D related cancer-predisposing syndrome. The tumor
spectrum is well documented and encomprises multiple
colonic and extracolonic (e.g. endometrium and stomach)
malignancies [2]. Cancers arise due to a germ-line mutation
in one of the MMR genes; to the most part hMLH1 or hMSH2
(less frequently hMSH6 and rarely hPMS2) followed by a

INTRODUCTION
Lawrence Loeb who described possible relation­ships
between DNA replication errors and malignant progression
in 1974 initially formulated microsatellite instability (MSI)
or mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D) as a mutator
phenotype [1]. Today, much is known about affected
proteins and clinical diseases that arise because of MMR-D.

somatic second hit (chromatin alterations, such as histone
modifications or mutations, rarely promoter methylations)
that inactivates the relevant MMR gene [3, 4].
As a consequence of MMR-D, unrepaired mutations
become scattered throughout the genome, this situation
defines the mutator or MSI phenotype and is present in
virtually all LS-associated cancers. A unique characteristic
of MSI+ cancers is the expression of neoantigens due to
frameshift mutations (FSM; often 1 or 2 bp deletions) in
coding regions of genes. Such FSM constitute true targets
for and may contribute to MMR-D-driven mutagenesis and
have recently been recognized as ideal (immunological)
antigens for vaccination strategies [5].
In recent years, mice lines homozygous negative for
each individual DNA MMR protein have been established
[6-8]. These models helped in understanding principle
biologic processes and pathological consequences which arise
because of MMR-D. Here, and similar to the human system in
Lynch, MLH1 and MSH2 are major players in MMR-D-driven
carcinogenesis. Tumors display a high MSI phenotype, with
microsatellites being instable in both mono- and dinucleotide
repeats [9]. However, very few data exist on the target gene
mutational pattern of MMR gene knockout mice. In the only
prior study by Woerner et al., FSMs in coding regions of
genes were reported [10]. The authors identified MSI target
genes in gastrointestinal tumors (GIT) of different MMR-D
mouse strains – some of them were even shared between
the human and mouse orthologues [10]. These findings are
indicative of similar molecular alterations among different
species and provide another rationale for knockout mice as
models for human MMR-D related diseases. In addition of
being representative for LS, these models may be even more
akin to a rare inherited human cancer syndrome, in which
patients carry biallelic or constitutional MMR-D (CMMR-D)
[11, 12]. Very similar to the complex tumor spectrum of

affected patients, MMR-D mice predominantly develop early
lymphomas followed by GIT at later age. But unlike GIT, the
presence of coding FSMs in murine lymphomas has not been
investigated yet. It is therefore unknown if both tumor entities
have similar mutational profiles. If so, these coding FSMs
may act as true (shared) target antigens for functional analysis.
The present study was intended to (I) compare the
pattern of coding FSMs in lymphomas and GIT from MLH1-/mice, (II) examine the interplay between tumor cells and
their immune environment and (III) detect more selective
target genes in a freshly established MLH1-/- GIT cell line.
Identifying concurrences and disparities between both tumor
entities helps to gain deeper insights in the mechanisms that
underlie MMR-D driven murine carcinogenesis and may
pave the way also for preclinical studies on the optimization
of MSI-specific vaccination strategies prospectively – for
both LS and CMMR-D patients.

RESULTS
Tumor spectrum of MLH1-/- mice
For this comparative study, 21gastrointestinal tumors
(GIT; from 20 individual mice) and 21 lymphomas (from 11
individual mice) were collected. Lymphomas were detected
in the thymus (n=3), spleen (n=7), liver (n=5), kidney (n=3),
and duodenum (n=2). Due to the higher aggressiveness of
these hematological malignancies, lymphoma development
was usually seen before mice were 40 weeks old, while
gastrointestinal tumors were only seen at later time (> 42
weeks), which is consistent with the literature [6]. All but one
gastrointestinal tumor case were found in the duodenum and
histologically defined as well differentiated adenomas (#5)
or adenocarcinomas showing different invasive potential and
cellular infiltration pattern (Figure 1). The only colorectal

considered further here (data not shown). Interestingly, the
only adenoma (#5) was strongly infiltrated with CD3+CD4+
T cell, but cytotoxic T cells were virtually absent - partially
matching with observations from human Lynch-associated
tumors [17].
Comparing these findings with lymphomas, minor
differences regarding the surface expression profile are
obvious (Figure 3A left chart). NHL where usually CD3CD4+CD8+ T cell precursors showing intermediate CD168
expression, the receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility
(RHAMM). Assessment of immune checkpoint proteins
revealed high expression of PD-L1, CTLA-4 (CD152) and
IDO in all tumors, while levels of lymphocyte activating
gene 3 (LAG-3) and PD-1 were below 20% in both NHL
and GIT, with a tendency towards higher expression in the
latter (Figure 3A, right chart).
Then, the infiltration pattern of MLH1-/- GI tumors
was studied in more detail (Figure 3C). In line with very
recent reports on human MSI+ CRC, PD-L1 and PD-1 was
expressed by stromal cells and infiltrating lymphocytes,
while CTLA-4 was highly upregulated on epithelial
cells (Figure 3B and [18]). Tumors showed focal CD3+
T cell infiltration (CD4+ and CD8+), usually forming cell
clusters. T cells were located at the invasive front and
distributed throughout the tumor stroma. Likewise, GIT
were infiltrated with CD11b+ granulocytes and CD200R+
macrophages. Both cell populations have been linked to
immune evasion and tumor progression. In line with the

MLH1-/- tumor phenotyping & immune cell
infiltration
Confirming their epithelial origin, all GIT expres­
sed high amounts of the surface marker CD104, a type I
transmembrane glycoprotein (= β4 integrin), that associates
with integrin α6 to form the α6/β4 heterodimer. As can be
depicted from Figure 2A, CD104 expression was restricted
to tumor cells, while no expression was detectable on
stromal or infiltrating (immune) cells. As determined
by flow cytometry, levels of CD104+ tumor cells ranged
from 21-98 % (Figure 2B), reflecting the different
number of tumor cells within the resection specimen.
Additional phenotyping identified high CD178 (FasL)
and CD71 expression, the latter being indicative for a
high proliferation index [16]. MHC class I expression was
also high (about 80%), while only few tumor cells were
MHC class II positive. About 40% of the cells expressed
the TWEAK receptor CD266 (Figure 3A, left chart). Of
note, when analyzing T cell infiltration – a hallmark of
human Lynch-associated tumors – considerable levels of
both T helper and cytotoxic T cells were found (Figure 3A,
middle chart). High tumor-infiltrating T cell numbers were
even detectable in a MLH1+/- derived GIT, which was not

natural tumors’ immunosuppressive character, NK cells
and γδ T cells were only occasionally detectable within
the analyzed resection specimens.

As anticipated, all GI tumors and lymphomas
showed high level of MSI when compared to normal tail
DNA, usually occurring as mono- or biallelic deletions
(Supplementary Table S3A and S3B). Though only
minor variances were found between individual tumor
cases, differences concerning the level of instability
were obvious, with long repeats being more instable
than shorter ones (e.g. Bat30 (A30 repeat) and Bat59 (A59
repeat) vs. Bat26 (A26 repeat) and U12235 (A24 repeat),
Figure 4, upper panel).

MSI analysis of murine MLH1-/- tumors
MSI in non-coding regions was assessed by
applying a panel of 10 microsatellite markers. Tumors
were classified as MSI high if three or more marker were
instable.

Additional MSI analysis in dinucleotide markers
D1Mit79 and D15Mit93 (harboring a CA31 and CA32
repeat, respectively) revealed some variations between
GIT and lymphomas. 35% and 20% of analyzed
lymphomas showed instability in at least one dinucleotide
marker. Instability in GIT occurred as single base mutation
(D1Mit79). The dinucleotide marker D15Mit93 was
only instable in one case (#4), while the remaining GIT
harbored wildtype D15Mit93.

mutations were more frequent in GIT than in NHL (Table
1A and 1B). In GIT, half of the analyzed markers showed
instability, present as mono- or biallelic single base
deletion (Table 1A and Figure 4, lower panel). Insertions
occurred rather infrequently. Of note, each tumor had
its own individual mutational profile. Microsatellites of
Phactr4, Rfc3, Senp6 and Rasal2 were most affected.
The mutation frequency ranged from 40 – 100% for these
markers.
Among lymphomas, mutations were detected in 10
out of 26 markers tested (Table 1B). Here again, highest
frequency was identified in the coding region of the
Rfc3 gene, located on chromosome 5. Hence, all MLH1/derived tumors harbored an inactivating mutation in
this gene. Functionally, the Rfc3 protein is related to
cell cycle and mitosis. Besides, half of the NHL had
mutations in Tmem60 and Rasal2 microsatellites. The

of the highly invasive human CRC line HCT116 (87.7%
vs. control; Figure 5C). As determined by PCR, the
cell line was found free of contaminating mycoplasma
(Figure 5D).

Radiosensitivity and drug response

MLH1-/- cell line establishment &
characterization

Upon exposure to increasing doses of X-ray and
subsequent in vitro culture for 7 days, the MLH1-/-A7450
cells began to show impaired adherence. Microscopically,
classical signs of radiation induced cell-death were
evident, like plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear
fragmentation and atypical shapes. LD50 value was 12.5Gy
and thus slightly higher than for the MMR-proficient
control cells (LD50 CT26 and Colon-26 cells: 7Gy and
8Gy, respectively).
Next, response towards a panel of clinically
approved drugs was examined (Supplementary Table S4)
and again compared to response of the control cell lines
CT26 and Colon-26. MLH1-/-A7450 cells were sensitive
towards Gemcitabine, the standard drug for therapy of
pancreatic carcinomas. A comparable response was
seen upon treatment with Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan. By
contrast, cells were largely resistant against 5-FU and
Pemetrexed, which is in line with observations on human
MMR-D cells [14]. Additive effects were, however, seen
in combination therapy, i.e. FOLFOX and FOLFIRI.
Of note, all three cell lines showed good response
towards the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib, matching
with recent reports on Sorafenib-induced killing of
human CRC cells [19]. As anticipated, MLH1-/- A7450
cells were highly resistant against the alkylating agents

In a first attempt, parts of GI tumor specimens were
directly processed for in vitro cell line establishment
(n=10 individual tumors). This, however, did not yield
stable in vitro outgrowth. Therefore, parts of the tumor
were allografted into immunocompromised mice prior
to in vitro culture. With this method, allografting and
subsequent cell line establishment was successful in
1/10 cases. The cell line MLH1-/-A7450 originated from
a well-differentiated GI tumor (#4 from our biobank).
Initially, cell growth was dependent on coating plates
with Matrigel®. At later passages (about P7), cells grew
Matrigel®-independently. Determining morphology
re­vealed tight adherence to the bottom of the cell culture
flasks. MLH1-/-A7450 cells were characterized as
epithelial-like cells without contaminating fibroblasts.
In the early passages (≤10) multiple morphologically
different cell clones were visible (Figure 5A, upper
picture). Following serial passaging, they changed their
morphology and appeared as rather undifferentiated
small, polygonal and round cells not strictly growing in
monolayer (Figure 5A). They had a rapid growth kinetic
with doubling times of about 24 hours (Figure 5B). Quite
in line, the invasive potential was comparable with those

mutations being only detectable in the allograft and/or
the corresponding cell line (Table 2B). Accordingly, prior
analysis of the parental tumor might have been confounded
by normal epithelial stromal and immune cells. The
detected mutations here were found in microsatellites
of Nktr1, C8a, Taf1b and Lig4. All of them were present
as-1bp deletions and mostly affected one allele. FSMs in
coding microsatellites of Rasal2 and Supt16 were only
visible in the allograft but not in the corresponding cell
line. By contrast, shifts in fragment lengths of Tcf7l2 and
Ptpn21 were exclusively seen after in vitro culture. Hence,
mutations may be present in a single mutated clone that
had not been recognized in the resection specimen but
gave rise to in vitro growth and vice versa.

Comparative analysis: primary GIT vs. allograft
and allograft-derived cell line
Morphology of the allograft was compared with the
parental tumor (Figure 5E). By means of HE histology,
principal architectural and cytological features of the
primaries were preserved within the allograft, at least
over few passages (≤P4). The epithelial origin was
confirmed by positive immunoreactivity for CD104
(>90%; Figure 5F). Further characterization revealed high
expression of CD71, CD178 and MHC class I, whereas
the TWEAK receptor was differentially expressed
between primary and allograft (61.9% vs. 20%). Despite
this discrepancy, there was a high phenotypic similarity
amongst the parental tumor, the allograft and the
corresponding cell line (Figure 5F).
Further comparative characterization included MSI
analysis of non-coding and coding FSM. As anticipated,
MSI in long mononucleotide repeats increased during
passage (primary vs. cell line). Notably, samples showed
instability in all markers examined here (Table 2A).
Coding FSM analysis yielded different results, with some

DISCUSSION
Although the murine MLH1-/- mouse model is
well-documented in the literature, very few functional
data are available [6, 7]. A systematic analysis of
(I) the immunological microenvironment and (II)
the cMS frameshift mutational profile has not been
performed. Accordingly, the relevance of the immune
system for MLH1-/--driven murine tumorigenesis is not
well understood. The present study was conducted to
comprehensively address this question.

and tumor progression [24]. Vice versa and similar to
the situation of human LS, MLH1-/- derived GITs were
infiltrated with CD3+ T cells, indicating that the immune
system may play an active role in tumor surveillance.
T cells could even be found within cancer cell nests
(clusters), enabling direct contact between tumor and
effector cells. Additionally, immune checkpoint molecules
were detected within MLH1-/- tumor specimen, which is
consistent with findings on human LS and CMMR-D. In
humans, high expression of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 as well as
good response towards PD-L1 blockade was only recently
shown [18, 25 and an overview is given in Table 3].
The high immunogenicity of human MSI+ tumors
results from an abundant expression of frameshift
neopeptides that are generated as a consequence of
insertion/deletion mutations at coding regions of genes
[26, 27]. T cells infiltrating these tumors recognize MSI+specific neoantigens – some of them are known to be
shared by the majority of MSI+ CRCs [28]. The density of
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes even positively correlates
with the number of frameshift mutations in MSI+
tumors, making them perfect candidate antigens [28].
Consequently, two clinical vaccine trials have just been
initiated [trial number: NCT01461148 & NCT01885702].
Results are, however, still pending.
By contrast, little is known about MSI target genes
in murine driven tumorigenesis. In a pioneer work by
Woerner and colleagues, frameshift mutations in coding
regions of six genes from different MMR-D tumors
(MLH1-/-, MSH2-/-, MSH2loxP/loxP) were described [10]. Two
out of six genes (Rfc3, Elavl3) were even conserved in

The tumor spectrum observed here closely
matched initial descriptions [6]. MLH1-/- mice developed
gastrointestinal tumors as well as lymphomas at the same
frequency. Although the latter is a rare event in human
LS-driven MSI+ carcinogenesis, the tumor spectrum
and time of onset parallels with patients suffering from
biallelic MLH1 mutations [20]. Additionally, principal
MMR tumor suppression functions are conserved between
men and mice [21]. MLH1-/- mice are thus good models
for MMR-D related diseases in general – and maybe
even equivalent models to their human constitutional
counterpart. With the low overall number of patients and
the complex tumor spectrum it is not surprising that the
biology of CMMR-D-associated human tumors is not yet
understood. To date, tumor-host interactions in CMMR-D
patients have not been studied in detail [11, 12]. Initial
phenotyping experiments on MLH1-/- tumors revealed
surprisingly few differences in surface molecule
expression between both tumor entities. In line with
their aggressive in vivo growth kinetics, the transferrin
receptor CD71 and FasL were highly expressed. FasLexpressing tumors are known to establish an immuneprivileged status in situ to protect themselves from the
immune response [22]. By contrast, human MSI+ tumor
cells do not seem to use FasL to “counterattack” and kill
Fas-expressing infiltrating lymphocytes [23]. Additional
immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the natural
immunosuppressive character of MLH1-/- derived GITs.
Tumors were highly infiltrated with CD11b+ granulocytes
and CD200R+ tumor-associated (M2) macrophages. Both
cell populations have been linked to immune evasion

type and length in their human orthologues, suggesting at
least partial overlap of MSI target genes and involvement
of common oncogenic mechanisms between these two
species. In MLH1-/--derived GITs, a high mutation
frequency in the microsatellite sequences of Phactr4
(A10), Senp6 (A11) and Rfc3 (A10) was evident [10].
Here, we report several novel findings. First, instability
in coding regions of genes is common in both MLH1-/derived tumor entities analyzed here (i.e. GIT and NHL).
We even identified another candidate antigen showing
sequence identity with the human orthologue. The protein
function of Tmem60 is largely unknown, but seems to be
involved in creatinine production and secretion. It was
here found to be mutated in 30% (GIT) and 48% (NHL)
of tumors, respectively. Of note and similarly to the
surface marker expression analysis, there were no clear
differences in mutation frequencies of particular target
genes between GITs and lymphomas. An organ-specific
mutational profile, as has been proposed for human
MSI+ tumors in some studies [29], is thus rather unlikely.
Interestingly, this finding matches with our previous
results on human MMR-D lymphoma/leukemia and
CRC cell lines, describing an almost identical mutational
susceptibility of specific target genes between these two
tumor entities [30]. Second, the most frequently mutated
gene was Rfc3, supporting the idea that alterations in this
gene are important for the development of MLH1-/- tumors
– irrespective of organ manifestation. This hypothesis
is further corroborated by the presence of Rfc3 gene
mutations already in the adenomas of MLH1-/- mice (case
#5 and Table 1A). Third, we identified another potential
candidate gene of MLH1-/- driven tumorigenesis, Rasal2
(RAS Protein Activator Like 2). Approximately half of the
analyzed GITs and lymphomas harbored an inactivating
FSM in an A8 repeat of this gene. Rasal2 encodes a protein
that contains the GAP-related domain, a characteristic
domain of GTPase-activating proteins. As such, RasGAPs
(Ras GTPase-activating proteins) function as tumor
suppressors [31]. Indeed, another RasGAP encoding gene,
the NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), is a frequent somatic
target for CMMR-D-related cancers and it was also shown
to be mutated in murine MLH1-/- embryonic fibroblasts
[32, 33]. It is thus reasonable to assume that RasGAPs
have a causal role in MMR-D driven tumorigenesis.
Prospective functional in vitro and in vivo studies will
show if these genes are in fact true target antigens. If so,
they are perfect candidates for vaccination strategies.
In principle, an ideal vaccine counteracts tumor
heterogeneity and overcomes selection of antigen-negative
clones escaping peptide-specific immune responses
[34]. Hence, to fully cover a broad tumor antigen profile,
additional candidate structures must be identified.
Since non-malignant cells and clonal variations might
compromise detection sensitivity in analyses of primary
tumor material, cell cultures are a perfect starting point
for screening of mutational target genes. We therefore
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

established a stable outgrowing MLH1-/- GIT cell line.
Although multiple human MMR-D cell lines are available
it is noteworthy that this is, to the best of our knowledge,
the first murine MMR-D cell line to be described. We would
like to state that (I) murine cells can be used for comparative
analysis with human material, e.g. for examining the
changes in mutational load upon in vitro culture, for drug
response screening prior to in vivo testing and/or detecting
acquired resistance mechanisms, (II) they represent a
virtually unlimited source of tumor material devoid of nonmalignant cells (fibroblasts, infiltrating leukocytes and cells
of the blood vessels) for identification of additional coding
microsatellites affected by MSI, (III) they can be used as
target cells for functional (immunological) assays and (IV)
will finally be used as standardized source of MMR-D
induced mutations and neoantigens. Basic characterization
of the established epithelial cell line revealed a rapid growth
kinetic, a heterogeneous response towards standard cancer
drugs and large resistance against alkylating agents, which
concedes with our findings on human MSI+ CRC lines [14
and data not shown].
Are MMR-D mice good models for functional
analysis, especially in the context of immune-based
therapeutic approaches? Of course, there are species-specific
differences in terms of life span, exposure to mutagens and
diet that contribute to dissimilarities in cancer formation as
for example similar frequencies of lymphomas and GITs
in mice vs. rare lymphomagenesis in man, especially in
the context of LS (an overview on the most common and
novel findings is provided in Table 3). Besides, underlying
immunological mechanisms may vary (Table 3). MLH1/tumors show high MHC class I expression, while in
human LS-associated cancers, β2-microglobulin mutations
and accordingly HLA class I loss or downregulation
is frequent (up to 40%); most likely resulting from an
active immune selection process [35]. One may speculate
that tumors in mice with constitutional MMR-D evade
immunosurveillance using different mechanisms (as PD-L1
and CTLA-4 expression). Also, murine NK cells are known
to be very effective in tumor cell killing. Hence, down
regulation or even loss of MHC class I would simply not
allow tumors to grow in this microenvironment. Therefore,
MHC class I expression is preserved. The observed
lymphocytic tumor infiltration pattern (of both CD4+ and
CD8+ cells), the elevated expression of immune checkpoints
(particularly PD-L1 and CTLA-4) and the identified FSMs
in coding regions of potential MSI target genes supports
these ideas; thus being indicative for an active involvement
of the immune system on MLH1-/- driven carcinogenesis.
This makes them reliable preclinical models for cellular
immunotherapies, an especially tempting goal for MMR-D
related diseases [5, 30, 36, 38]. Finally, transferring these
observations into a mouse model with organ specific
MLH1 knockdown will help providing deeper insights into
similarities and disparities between individual tumors that
arise as a consequence of MMR-D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

outgrowing cultures could be passaged >40 times with
no changes in morphology. In some experiments, murine
CT26 and Colon-26 cells were used as MMR-proficient
controls.

Mice breeding & genotyping
Homozygous mice were generated by breeding
heterozygous males and females of the ≥F5 generation,
hence all mice used in this study were >90% C57BL/6
[6]. All animals received standard laboratory chow and
free access to water. Mice breeding took place in the
animal facilities (University of Rostock) under specified
pathogen-free conditions. Trials were performed in
accordance with the German legislation on protection of
animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources,
National Research Council; NIH Guide, vol.25, no.28,
1996; approval number: LALLF M-V/TSD/7221.31.1-053/12). Mlh1 genotyping was done according to
[6]. In each generation, offspring of all three classes in
the expected ratios were obtained (i.e. about 20-25%
homozygous mice).

Microsatellite and coding microsatellite (cMS)
frameshift mutation analysis
For detecting MSI in non-coding regions, a panel
of microsatellite markers consisting of mononucleotide
(n=8) and dinucleotide repeats (n=2) was applied (primer
sequences can be taken from Supplementary Table S1) [8,
9]. PCR conditions were: 94°C, 4 min (1 cycle); 94°C,
30 s, 58°C, 45 s and 72°C, 30 s (35 cycles); and 72°C, 6
min (1 cycle). Fluorescently labeled DNA fragments were
analyzed on a 3500 Genetic Analyzer. In each reaction,
normal tail DNA served as microsatellite stable (MSS)
controls. Tumor samples were scored as MSI+ if novel
peaks were obtained compared to MSS controls or if the
ratio of peak areas in MLH1-/- samples and stable controls
(tail gDNA of the same mouse) revealed values ≤0.5 or
≥2 [according to 10]. Tumors were scored as MSI+ if ≥
3/10 markers showed instability. To identify potential
MLH1 target genes, a panel (n=26) was screened. Genes
included in this study were either already described
as being candidates [10, 15] or based on extensive
database research (own unpublished data). Primers were
designed using Primer3 software to yield short amplicons
(≤ 200 bp). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table S2. PCR conditions and analysis of results were as
described above.

Sample collection, murine tumor biobanking,
allografting & cell line establishment
Mice were sacrificed before theybecame moribund.
After sacrifice, blood samples and tumors were resected.
In case of lymphomagenesis, tumors were evident in
thymus, spleen, liver, and/or kidney. For detection of GIT,
the entire gastrointestinal tract (duodenum, caecum, and
colon) was removed and examined for tumor presence
under a dissecting microscope. Tumors manifested in both
duodenum and colon, with predominance in the former.
Upon removal, tumor samples were cut into small pieces
and processed further. Parts of the tumor were snap frozen
or fixed in Tissue Tek® for molecular and histological
analysis. Another piece was further processed for flow
cytometric phenotyping. Remaining tumor tissues were
frozen viable (FCS, 10% DMSO) at -80°C for subsequent
allografting into NMRI Foxn1nu mice as described before
[13]. Growing allografts (≥1.500 mm3) were resected
and processed further for cell line establishment as per
description in [14]. In brief, cell culture of the MLH1-/allograft 7450 (hereafter termed MLH1-/-A7450: MLH1/= MLH1 knockout; A = allograft + serial breeding
number) was started from single cell suspensions, seeded
on Matrigel®-coated plates in DMEM medium (+ 10%
FCS, 2mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics) and incubated at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% C02. Medium was
changed regularly. Continually growing cell cultures were
further passaged and regularly stocked in low passages.
Authentication was done by MLH1 genotyping as stated
above (verification of complete MLH1 knockout) and flow
cytometric phenotyping (e.g. CD104, CD71 and MHC I
and Figure 5). Quality control included exclusion of crosscontaminating human cells or mycoplasma by PCR, which
was performed every 10th passage [14]. So far, stable

Flow cytometry on blood & tumor samples
Blood samples were taken routinely from the
retrobulbar venous plexus of MLH1-/- mice and stained
with a panel of conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAb)
followed by lysis of erythrocytes (FACS Lysing Solution, BD
Pharmingen). Negative controls consisted of lymphocytes
stained with the appropriate isotypes (BD Pharmingen). For
phenotyping of tumor samples, 5 x 105 cells were washed
and stained with respective FITC- PE- APC- or PE/Cylabeled mAbs. Cells were washed and resuspended in 200
μl PBS. Negative controls were stained with the appropriate
isotypes. Additionally, cultured tumor cells were phenotyped
using a panel of Abs (for details see Figure 5). Cells were
analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur
Cytometer (BD Pharmingen). Data analysis was performed
using CellQuest software (BD Pharmingen).

Histology & immunofluorescence
Cryostat sections of 4 μm were air-dried and fixed
in cold pure methanol for 8 min. Unspecific binding sites
were blocked in 2% BSA (2h) followed by incubation
with 1 μg of the following FITC-labeled mAbs: CD3ε,

Cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates
(5 x 104 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight.
Thereafter, triplicate wells were exposed to increasing
drug concentrations (pharmacy of the university hospital
Rostock) for 72 hours, followed by a second treatment
(another 72 hours). Additionally, cells were exposed to
two cycles of alkylating agents N-Nitroso-N-ethylurea
and O6-Benzylguanine. Following these two treatment
cycles, medium was removed; plates were carefully
washed and stained with crystal violet (0.2%, 10
min). Finally, drug effects from triplicate wells were
determined at the level of 50% inhibition (IC50) in
comparison to control, measured at 570 nm (reference

determined upon γ-radiation (ranging from 0 – 100 Gy)
and subsequent in vitro culture (7 days). LD50 (dose of
radiation expected to cause death to 50% of all cells)
was determined by crystal violet as described.
