ABSTRACT
The hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) is a member of the SRC family of cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinases (SFKs), and is expressed in cells of the myeloid and B-lymphocyte cell
lineages. Excessive HCK activation is associated with several types of leukemia and
enhances cell proliferation and survival by physical association with oncogenic fusion
proteins, and with functional interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases. Elevated
HCK activity is also observed in many solid malignancies, including breast and colon
cancer, and correlates with decreased patient survival rates. HCK enhances the
secretion of growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines from myeloid cells, and
promotes macrophage polarization towards a wound healing and tumor-promoting
alternatively activated phenotype. Within tumor associated macrophages, HCK
stimulates the formation of podosomes that facilitate extracellular matrix degradation,
which enhance immune and epithelial cell invasion. By virtue of functional cooperation
between HCK and bona fide oncogenic tyrosine kinases, excessive HCK activation can
also reduce drug efficacy and contribute to chemo-resistance, while genetic ablation
of HCK results in minimal physiological consequences in healthy mice. Given its known
crystal structure, HCK therefore provides an attractive therapeutic target to both,
directly inhibit the growth of cancer cells, and indirectly curb the source of tumorpromoting changes in the tumor microenvironment.

two isoforms differ from each other by acylation of their
N-terminal domain, and as a consequence, exhibit distinct
subcellular localizations [1]. The larger isoform is mainly
associated with lysosomes due to myristoylation of a glycine
(Gly) residue at position +2 relative to the amino terminal
methionine (Met). Meanwhile, p59HCK is mostly confined
to the plasma membrane as a result of myristoylation (at
Gly +2) and of palmitoylation of a cysteine or serine (at Cys/
Ser +6) which form part of a Met-Gly-Cys-X-X-Cys/Ser-X
consensus sequence [1, 3]. Importantly, SFK members exhibit
complementary and often functionally redundant roles in
several signal transduction pathways, such as the cooperation
of FYN and LCK in T-cell receptor mediated activation
[4, 5], and the regulation of macrophage phagocytosis by
HCK and FGR [6]. This functional overlap between the
SFK members has been shown to play an important role in
maintaining relatively normal immune responses in situations
of impairment or mutation of one of these kinases [6].

INTRODUCTION
The SRC family of non-receptor protein tyrosine
kinases (SFK) consists of 9 members, and can be divided
into two groups according to the expression pattern of the
individual kinases in the adult. Accordingly, SRC, YES and
FYN are ubiquitously expressed, while expression of LCK,
FGR, BLK, LYN, YRK and HCK is limited to certain types
of cells and tissues. HCK expression is confined to cells of
the myeloid and B-lymphocyte lineages and the protein exists
as two isoforms. In humans, they comprise the p61HCK
and p59HCK isoforms consisting of 525 and 504 amino
acids, respectively, while in mice HCK exists as p59HCK
(503 amino acids) and p56HCK (482 amino acids). In
either species the two isoforms are generated by alternative
initiation of protein translation from two in-frame initiation
codons found within a single mRNA [1, 2] (Figure 1A). The

Figure 1: Schematic representation of HCK structure and regulation. A. The HCK protein exists as two isoforms generated

from the alternate use of two in-frame initiation codons of translation on a single mRNA. Both protein isoforms are composed of an
acylated unique N-terminal domain followed by SRC Homology (SH) domains SH3, SH2 and SH1. The SH1 domain contains the catalytic
domain with conserved tyrosine residues (YA), while the very C-terminal tail contains a regulatory tyrosine (YT). B. HCK is maintained in
an inactive conformation by the binding of the SH2 linker to the SH3 domain, and by the binding of the phosphorylated tyrosine YT to the
SH2 domain. Activation of HCK occurs following dephosphorylation of YT phosphatases, as well as auto/trans-phosphorylation of the YA
residue. Adapted from Guiet et. al, 2008.

HCK structure and regulation

Under steady-state conditions, HCK is maintained
in an inactive conformation by two complementing intramolecular associations (Figure 1B). The first involves
binding of the SH2 domain to the phosphorylated YT at
the C-terminal tail, while the second involves binding of
the SH3 domain to the proline-rich type II helical motif
in the linker between the SH2 and SH1 domains [10].
Two enzymatic modifications mediate this inhibitory
conformation, namely dephosphorylation of pYA by CD45,
a trans-membrane receptor-like tyrosine phosphatase that
is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells [12], and
phosphorylation of YT by either the C-terminal SRC kinase
(CSK) or the C-terminal SRC kinase-homologous kinase
(CHK) [13]. In contrast to ubiquitously expressed CSK,
CHK expression is limited to neurons and hematopoietic
cells and may also inhibit SFKs in a non-catalytic manner
by forming stable complexes with SFKs [14].
HCK activation is triggered by a variety of stimuli,
including binding of bacterial lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) to the CD14/Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 protein
complex, cytokines such as Interleukin (IL)-2, IL6
and related ligands, and the Granulocyte Macrophage

HCK shares with all the other SFKs a common
architecture of five distinct domains [7, 8] (Figure 1A).
They comprise a SFK-family member-specific N-terminal
domain required for the aforementioned lipid
modifications, followed by three highly conserved
SRC Homology domains (SH3, SH2 and SH1) and a
C-terminal tail containing a regulatory tyrosine residue
(YT) at position 521 in human p61HCK, or 499 in mouse
p59HCK, respectively [9]. The regulatory SH3 and SH2
domains bind to a proline-rich Pro-X-X-Pro motif and a
phospho-tyrosine pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile motif, respectively
[10]. The catalytic SH1 domain contains two lobes that
form the active site of the kinase, which is stabilized upon
phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residues (YA) at
position 410 in human p61HCK (388 in mouse p59HCK)
near the ATP binding site [9]. The small N-terminal lobe of
the SH1 domain is composed of five β-sheets and a single
α-helix responsible for ATP binding, while the second
larger lobe is predominantly α-helical and binds to protein
substrates [11].

Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) receptor [15–17]
(Table 1). In response to stimulation, the YT residue
is dephosphorylated by CD45 or SHP1, and HCK
undergoes a conformational change involving the
disruption of the SH3-linker interaction which enables
“unfolding” of the protein and phosphorylation of the
YA residue [10]. However, HCK activation may also
occur through non-catalytic mechanisms that disrupt the
intra-molecular inhibitory interactions. In particular, the
HIV-1 NEF protein can bind directly to the SH3 domain
of HCK thereby disrupting the SH3-linker interaction
and promoting a significant increase in catalytic activity
[17, 18].
Upon activation, HCK engages a range of down­
stream signaling pathways that mediate various aspects of
the immune response (Table 1). Critical roles for HCK in
these processes have been demonstrated in mice carrying

knock-out alleles (HCKKO) or encoding, as a knock-in
mutation, a constitutively active protein with a tyrosineto-phenylalanine (Y499F) substitution mutation (HCKCA).
While HCKKO mice display a relatively mild phenotype,
macrophages from these animals exhibit reduced
phagocytic ability. Consistent with functional redundancy
among SFKs, compound HCKKO;FGRKO knock-out mice
show impaired myeloid cell degranulation and migration
culminating in increased susceptibility to infection [6, 19].
In contrast, HCKCA animals are highly responsive to LPS,
and display an exaggerated innate immune response with
the corresponding macrophages and neutrophils exhibiting
enhanced effector functions in vitro, including nitric oxide
and TNFα production, chemotaxis, and degranulation [20].
As a consequence, HCKCA mice spontaneously acquire a
lung pathology characterized by extensive eosinophilic
and mononuclear cell infiltration within the lung

collectively suggest that SFK overexpression in tumor
cells can occur as a result of exaggerated activation of
upstream signaling pathways as well as aberrant epigenetic
modifications to exaggerate SFK activation.
SFK activation by suppression of CSK and Cbp/PAG

SFK deregulation in cancer

Phosphorylation of YT is crucial for SFK inactivation
and the loss of this residue confers constitutive activation
and transforming capabilities of oncogenic v-SRC and
v-YES proteins [33]. Disruption of the interaction between
YT and the SH2 domain can result from impaired CSK
activity or from pY-residues of growth factor receptors,
which compete for binding to the SH2 domain in
SFKs, thereby yielding an open and catalytically active
conformation [34]. Although CSK was initially thought
to act as a tumor suppressor, its contribution to cancer
remains less clear. In hepatocellular carcinoma, reduced
CSK levels inversely correlate with SFK activity [35].
However, increased CSK expression along with SFK
activity has been observed in primary carcinoma [36]
and human colorectal cancer cell lines [37], indicating
that CSK-dependent regulation of SFK signaling may be
specific to some cancers. CSK may also contribute to SFK
deregulation by altered trafficking, since CSK-mediated
inhibition of SFK relies on membrane-associated CSK
binding proteins [38]. Interestingly, this recruitment step
is impaired in colorectal cancer, resulting in retention
of CSK in the cytoplasm [39]. In accordance with these
observations, expression of Cbp/PAG, which traffics CSK
to the membrane, is frequently reduced in human colorectal
tumors, while introduction of Cbp/PAG into metastatic
colorectal cancer cells restores membrane translocation of
CSK and reduces invasion of these cells into extracellular
matrix [39]. Collectively, these results suggest an important
role for Cbp/PAG in ensuring proper CSK localization and
associated physiological regulation of SFK activity.

Deregulation of SFKs has been implicated in
disease, including cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune
disease [21–23]. The initial recognition of the oncogenic
potential of SFKs builds on observations by the
pathologist Peyton Rous linking the formation of sarcoma
in chickens to (retroviral) infection of these birds [24].
Subsequently, it was shown that the genome of the Roussarcoma virus (RSV) encoded for a constitutive active
tyrosine kinase referred to as Rous Sarcoma kinase (SRC),
which transformed fibroblasts and conferred uncontrolled
proliferation [25]. However, it was the seminal work
by Harold Varmus and Michael Bishop in 1979, which
described the discovery of a mammalian orthologue
of the viral (v)-SRC protein, referred to as cellular (c)
SRC. Importantly, it was shown that RSV had integrated
a genomic sequence encoding for a truncated version of
c-SRC that lacked the regulatory carboxy-terminal tail
including the regulatory YT at amino acid position 527.
Hence, unlike its cellular counterpart c-SRC, by now
referred to as a “proto-oncogene”, v-SRC remained
constitutively active [26]. These insights resulted in
a paradigm shift for cancer not only arising from the
acquisition of foreign DNA (i.e. viruses), but more
commonly by acquiring mutations in endogenous genes
that transformed highly regulated proto-oncogenes to bona
fide oncogenes encoding proteins permanently locked in
their active conformation. Elevated c-SRC activity and
mutations that functionally replicate the v-SRC truncation
have now been detected in a wide variety of malignancies.
While the oncogenic potential of c-SRC is widely
accepted, we discuss here emerging novel mechanisms
by which deregulated HCK activity contributes to tumor
initiation and progression, including gene amplification
and the interaction with regulatory phosphatases and
upstream receptor tyrosine kinases.

SFK activation by tyrosine phosphatases
SFKs can also act as substrates for protein tyrosine
phosphatases other than CD45 and SHP1, which otherwise
primarily regulate the activity of SFKs. Increased activity
of PTPα, PTPB1, TCPTP and other tyrosine phosphatases
may also contribute to elevated SFK activity and sustained
signaling [40]. Short hairpin RNA-mediated suppression
of PTPα, for instance, reduced SRC activity by up to
four-fold in human breast and colon cancer cell lines
[41], while overexpression of PTP1B increased SRC
activity and promoted anchorage-dependent growth of
colon cancer cells [42]. In addition, inhibition of tyrosine
phosphatases may also promote SFK activation by
increasing the level of the phosphorylated YA residue in
their SH1 domain. TCPTP protein levels are reduced in
a subset of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and
HER2 triple-negative human breast cancers, and TCPTP
deficient breast cancer cell lines exhibit elevated SFK
signaling [43]. Conversely, reintroduction of TCPTP
into these cells reduced SFK activity, and impaired cell

SFK overexpression
Increased SFK activity and/or gene expression
is frequently detected in tumor biopsies [27]. HCK
gene amplification is observed in poorly differentiated
human gastric cancer [28] and several colorectal cancer
cell lines [29]. Increased SRC expression is observed
in intestinal adenomas of the ApcMin mouse model of
familial adenomatous polyposis, suggesting that the
WNT/β-catenin pathway may contribute to increased
SRC signaling [30]. Epigenetic changes have also
been proposed to induce overexpression of SFKs [21].
Furthermore, microRNA-23b and miRNA-145, which are
downregulated in many prostate and colorectal cancers,
repress SRC and YES activity [31, 32]. These observations

proliferation and anchorage-independent growth [43].
Likewise, treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with
tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors increased pYA of SRC in
adherent cells [44], while PTPL1 inactivation in colorectal
cancer cells promoted anchorage-independent cell growth
[45]. Together, these results suggest that inhibition of
tyrosine phosphatases plays a key role in mediating
excessive SFK activity in cancer cells.

feedback loop whereby SFK activity increases with RTK
activity to fuel tumor promotion.

HCK signaling in leukemia
HCK expression is elevated in various types of
leukemia (Table 2), and contributes to leukemogenesis
through its association with the oncogenic fusion proteins
BCR/ABL and TEL/ABL to enhance cell survival.
However, decreased HCK activation has also been
reported in a small number of acute myeloid leukemia and
acute promyelocytic leukemia patients.

SFK association with receptor tyrosine kinases
The association of SFKs with receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK) has been implicated in situations of
persistent RTK signaling in cancer [46]. SFK activation
occurs in response to ligand binding of platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PGDFR), epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
and others. In these situations, SFKs are involved in the
transduction of signals required for receptor turnover, actin
cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell survival [46]. There is
evidence that the SH2 domain of SFKs can bind directly
to pY599 in PDGFR [47] (Figure 2A). This interaction
disrupts intramolecular interaction between the SH2
domain and the pYT residue in SFKs, and exposes their
YA residue to become available for phosphorylation [34].
SFK activation can also occur by an indirect mechanism,
since EGFR does not contain consensus pY residues to
enable binding of the SH2 domain of SFKs (Figure 2A).
In epithelial cancers expression of EGFR, ERBB2 and to a
lesser extent other EGFR-family members, is increased by
mutation and/or gene amplification and this is commonly
associated with excessive SRC signaling [48, 49]. Indeed,
excessive SFK activity can activate these RTKs in the
absence of their ligands [39]. Meanwhile, excessive
activation of c-MET, EPHA2 and other RTKs is required
for maintaining maximal SRC activity in colorectal cancer
cells [50], suggesting that SFK deregulation may create a

Interaction with oncogenic fusion proteins
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) accounts for 20%
of leukemias and is characterized by excessive production
of granulocytes that accumulate in the bone-marrow and
interfere with normal hematopoiesis. Over time, leukemic
cells build up and spill into the bloodstream, eventually
accumulating in organs and impairing the normal functions
of immune cells. HCK has been implicated in CML
through its direct association with, and activation by BCL/
ABL [51] (Figure 2B). The BCR/ABL oncogenic fusion
protein is derived from translocation of the c-ABL gene on
chromosome 9 to the BCR locus on chromosome 22 and
is present in a large majority of CML cases, as well as in
some acute lymphocytic leukemias [52, 53]. In response to
its association with BCR/ABL, HCK mediates persistent
activation of STAT5A and the excessive accumulation
of this latent transcription factor in the cytoplasm [51],
where STAT5A engages PI3K and the adaptor protein
GAB2 to activate AKT and to facilitate cell growth
and survival [51]. Interestingly, despite the functional
redundancy among SFK members, HCK appears to be the
most important kinase in BCR/ABL-induced signaling
[51, 54]. Overexpression studies demonstrate a physical

Figure 2: Simplified schematic depiction of HCK signaling in cancer cells. A. The interaction of HCK with receptor tyrosine

kinases such as EGFR and PDGFR results in the activation of ERK, AKT and STAT3 signaling pathways to promote cell proliferation in
cancer cells. B. Direct association of HCK with BCR/ABL results in the persistent activation of STAT5 and its retention in the cytoplasm.
Within the cytoplasm, STAT5 promotes cell growth and survival through the activation of AKT. HCK can also interact with TEL/ABL
to promote proliferation, survival and invasion through the activation of AKT and ERK pathways. C. HCK can bind directly to an acidic
domain (comprising of amino acids 711–811) of GP130 and mediate ERK and AKT signaling to induce cell survival and proliferation in
response to IL6 and related cytokines.

interaction between HCK and STAT5A that culminates
in STAT5A phosphorylation. While similar experiments
showed that LYN was also capable of inducing STAT5A
phosphorylation, there was no evidence of physical
interaction between LYN and STAT5A [54]. Furthermore,
co-expression of kinase-defective HCK mutants with
BCR/ABL strongly impaired transformation of cytokineindependent growth of myeloid leukemia cells [55], while
treatment with the broad-spectrum SFK inhibitor PP2
abrogated BCR/ABL-dependent activation of STAT5A
[54]. These studies identify a dominant role for HCK in
mediating BCR/ABL-induced activation of STAT5.
Expression of the TEL/ABL oncogenic fusion
protein is observed in T- and pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemias and some CML subsets [56–58], and promotes
constitutive activation of STAT5, ERK, AKT and other
pathways to facilitate the growth and survival of cancer
cells [59–61]. HCK activation is increased in TEL/ABLexpressing Ba/F3 cells. Conversely treatment with Imatinib,
which also suppresses TEL/ABL activity, inhibits HCK
activation as well as STAT5, ERK and AKT signaling [62]
(Figure 2B). Likewise, treatment of these cells with the SFK
inhibitors PP1, PP2 or SU6656 abrogates TEL/ABL activity
and induces growth arrest [62]. Indeed, HCK appears to be
a critical regulator of TEL/ABL-dependent growth, since
expression of kinase-dead HCK mutants inhibits the growth
of TEL/ABL transformed cells and the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 and AKT [62].
Although HCK expression is frequently increased
in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, HCK activity
is reduced in acute myeloid leukemia patients with the
specific chromosomal rearrangement inv(16)(p13q22)
[63]. Likewise, in acute lymphocytic leukemia patients,
which lack the BCR/ABL fusion protein, HCK expression
is reduced due to aberrant HCK gene methylation [64],
while in acute promyelocytic leukemia, HCK transcription
is repressed by the fusion protein promyelocytic leukemiaretinoic acid receptor α (PML-RARα). Since the PMLRARα protein promotes survival of myeloid precursor
cells, it has been proposed that HCK inhibition may

facilitate tumorigenesis by interfering with apoptosis
[65]. In line with this, knock-down of HCK by siRNA
substantially reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic
protein MCL-1, which coincided with increased expression
of pro-apoptotic BAX and enhanced death of cancer
cells [66]. Meanwhile, the interaction of HCK with the
guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G was shown to
indirectly induce apoptosis via a Caspase-1/8/9-dependent
mechanism, which depended on the catalytic activity of
HCK [67]. However, since the latter observation arose
from overexpression in epithelial cells, its physiological
relevance remains unclear.
IL6 signaling and survival
Multiple myelomas are characterized by excessive
production of plasma cells in the bone-marrow and require
IL6 signaling to promote cell growth and survival through
activation of the ERK and PI3K signaling cascade [68].
Ligation of IL6 to its receptor results in juxta-positioning
of the two IL6R β-chains (also referred to as GP130)
and activation of the associated JAK kinases, which in
turn confers phosphorylation of conserved cytoplasmic
tyrosine residues in GP130. They comprise the membrane
proximal pY that provides a docking site for the tyrosine
phosphatase SHP2 and the negative regulator SOCS3, and
four membrane distal pY, which serve as binding sites
for STAT3 and STAT1 [69]. In multiple myeloma cells,
various investigators have identified FYN, HCK and LYN
in co-immunoprecipitates with GP130, and stimulation of
these cells with IL6 results in increased activation of these
SFKs [70]. However, the interaction between HCK and
GP130 may be functionally more important for mediating
proliferative signals than binding of FYN or LYN to
GP130 [70]. Surprisingly, HCK was shown to mediate
ERK signaling independently of the aforementioned
association between GP130 and STAT3 or SHP2, but
rather through direct binding of HCK to an acidic domain
in GP130 (Figure 2C). Furthermore, deletion of this
region (amino acids 771–811) impaired IL6 dependent
HCK activation and reduced cell proliferation [71].

In line with this, expression of a kinase-dead HCK mutant
in mouse myeloma 7TD1 cells elicited a dominant-negative
effect on cell proliferation, thereby providing additional
evidence that HCK is required to transmit GP130dependent growth signals [72]. Similarly, we reported a
functional contribution of HCK to the GP130-mediated
signals that retain pluripotency of murine embryonic
stem cells [15], where HCK undergoes rapid and transient
activation in response to cells stimulated with the GP130
ligand leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF [73]. As in multiple
myeloma cells, we also found that HCK directly associates
with GP130 in embryonic stem cells [15].
The mechanism by which the GP130/HCK-containing
complex promotes IL6-induced activation of ERK
and PI3K in multiple myeloma cells is dependent on
the adaptor proteins GAB1 and GAB2, which are
constitutively associated with HCK. These scaffolding
proteins are involved in the recruitment of multimeric
protein complexes containing SHP2, GRB2, CRKL and
the p85 subunit of PI3K, which promote activation of
ERK and other downstream signaling molecules [68].
Importantly, kinase-dead HCK mutants, or treatment with
the SFK inhibitor PP2, reduced IL6-induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins
and significantly decreased myeloma cell survival and
proliferation [68]. Together, these results implicate
HCK, and possibly its association with the GAB adaptor
proteins, as key players in GP130-mediated multiple
myeloma pathogenesis.

anti-tumor responses [85]. HCK plays a key role in
neutrophil phagocytosis [86, 87], and has been shown
to co-localize with β-arrestin on the G-protein-coupled
IL8 receptor, where HCK traffics to azurophilic granulerich regions to initiate the release of their content [88].
Similarly, HCK also regulates macrophage activity by
promoting their proliferation [89], migration [90] and
secretion of IL6, TNFα and other cytokines [16, 91]. Thus,
in addition to its direct oncogenic role in (leukemic) cancer
cells, excessive HCK activation may be stimulated in
neighboring immune cells by incipient tumor cells through
cytokine secretion thereby reinforcing a tumor-enabling
and tumor-promoting microenvironment (Figure 3).
Inflammation
It has been recognized for more than a century
that inflammation is an enabling characteristic of many
cancers, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins and associated
enzymes are frequently detected in human and murine
tumors [92]. In colorectal cancer, for instance, TNFα [93],
IL6 [94] and IL1β [95] from tumor infiltrating neutrophils
has been shown to assist in neoplastic transformation and
expansion of the mutated epithelium. Furthermore, chronic
inflammation associated with hepatitis C virus infection
results in excessive TGFβ signaling, which promotes
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [96], while longterm cigarette smoke exposure increases the risk of lung
cancer and exacerbates lung inflammation [97]. Neoplastic
cells secrete inflammatory molecules such as TNFα [98]
and IL1β [99], likely as part of a wound-healing response
conserved from their epithelial origins thereby forming a
paracrine loop which perpetuates inflammation and sustain
the activity of inflammatory immune cells.
HCK is involved in inflammatory signaling, and in
human macrophages its increased expression augments
TLR4-induced transcription of TNFα and IL6 via the AP-1
transcription factor complex [16, 100]. Consistent with
this, genetic ablation of HCK in mice reduced cytokine
expression in response to LPS stimulation, and moderately
increased the susceptibility of HCKKO mice to infection
as a consequence of impaired immunity [6]. Conversely,
HCKCA mice display hypersensitivity to LPS-dependent
endotoxemia associated with excessive secretion of TNFα
and other inflammatory mediators [20]. HCK activation is
also critical in integrin-dependent adhesion and immune
cell recruitment during systemic inflammation [101,
102]. Thus, HCK provides a critical node that links the
extracellular environment to an adequate innate immune
cell response characterized by cytokine release and local
immune cell recruitment.
Although a functional link between HCK,
inflammation and solid cancers still remains somewhat
tenuous, we have observed that a small proportion of
aging HCKCA mice develop lung adenocarcinomas as
a subsequence to their spontaneous lung inflammation

HCK activation in tumor-associated immune
cells
Excessive HCK expression is observed in various
solid cancers, including those of the breast [16, 74].
The microenvironment of solid cancers comprises a
heterogeneous population of stromal cells that include
fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, mesenchymal
cells and immune cells. All of these cells “communicate”
with cancer cells and each other to promote tumor
development and progression [75] through the secretion
of growth factors [76] and cytokines [77] that promote
survival, angiogenesis [78], invasion [79] and metastasis
[80, 81]. Stromal cells also play a key role in suppressing
anti-tumor immune cell responses and conferring
resistance to chemotherapy [82, 83].
Myeloid cells, including macrophages, myeloidderived suppressor cells and neutrophils make up a major
component of the stromal compartment and contribute to
the tumor promoting mechanisms described above [84].
In particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
comprise distinct subsets of alternatively activated
macrophage that orchestrate many of the aforementioned
hallmarks and enabling characteristics of cancer. Likewise,
tumor-associated neutrophils have been shown to facilitate
and promote the suppression of immune cell mediated

involved in inflammatory signaling and its expression augments the release of TNFα, IL1β and IL6 from macrophages. These cytokines can
feedback onto tumor cells to perpetuate inflammation and sustain neoplastic transformation. HCK activation plays a key role in podosome
formation in macrophages and promotes their phagocytotic, chemotactic and matrix degradation abilities. This may enhance immune and
epithelial cell invasion by facilitating large-scale degradation of the extracellular matrix.

with characteristics of COPD [20]. In humans, COPD is
a major risk factor for lung cancer and is characterized
by increased numbers and activity of polymorphonuclear
leukocyte in sputum and bronchial lavage fluid of these
patients [103]. Consistent with this, HCK protein levels
are significantly elevated in neutrophils from COPD
patients [104]. Furthermore, genomic amplification of
the HCK locus has been observed in non-small cell
lung cancer [105, 106], suggesting a potential role for
HCK in promoting COPD-associated inflammation and
predisposition to lung cancer.

cells [90, 113]. These findings suggest that HCK is
involved in podosomal formation and ECM-degradation
by macrophages, which may enhance immune and
epithelial cell invasion and therefore comprise a key
step during tumor progression. Thus, while HCK has a
direct role in promoting some blood-derived cancers, its
aberrant activation in innate immune cells of the tumor
microenvironment facilitates tumorigenesis and enables
progression in experimental models and in human cancers.

HCK is associated with reduced chemosensitivity and acquired resistance

Migration and invasion
Metastatic spread is the major cause for cancer
mortality and occurs when cancer cells dissociate from
the primary tumor and seed into distal organs. Highly
invasive cancer cells form specialized matrix-degrading
membrane protrusions known as invadopodia, which
enable cancer cells to migrate through the tumor stroma
and to intravasate into blood and lymphatic vessels, from
where the cancer cells can spread to distant sites. TAMs
form protrusions known as podosomes that are similar to
invadopodia in molecular composition and proteolytic
activity [107]. Thus, the ECM-remodeling ability of
podosomes by TAMs could increase tumor invasiveness
by assisting the formation of tunnels in the matrix, thereby
enabling the escape of tumor cells independent of their
own matrix degrading abilities.
HCK plays a crucial role in podosome formation
by for instance phosphorylating the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein (WASP), a hematopoietic cell-specific
and actin nucleation promoting factor that regulates actin
polymerization and promotes phagocytosis, chemotaxis,
podosome formation and matrix degradation [108, 109].
In bone marrow-derived macrophages from HCKKO
mice, and in human HCK knock-down macrophage cell
lines, tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP in response to
CX3CL1 or Fcγ stimulation is significantly impaired,
and correlates with reduced phagocytosis, chemotaxis
and matrix degradation by these cells [109]. Individual
overexpression of the HCK isoforms in murine fibroblasts
revealed that p59HCKCA triggered the formation of plasma
membrane protrusions, while p61HCKCA resulted in
podosomal formation [110]. Importantly, co-expression
of both isoforms conferred a transformed phenotype in
these cells, manifested by the loss of contact inhibition,
shortened cell doubling time and serum independent
growth.
Stimulation of macrophages with LPS and/or IFNγ,
or with macrophage-colony stimulating factor not
only activates HCK, but also promotes formation of
podosomes and their arrangement into rosette clusters
[111, 112]. Indeed, HCKKO macrophages exhibit reduced
rosette forming ability and impaired matrix degradation,
consistent with reduced macrophage recruitment and
decreased efficiency in promoting invasion of tumor

Reduced sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy
is a major cause of tumor recurrence, and may arise from
genetic mutations, amplifications or epigenetic changes
that increase the expression or activity of pro-survival
factors, or regulate the uptake, metabolism and export of
cytotoxic drugs [114]. In the case of breast cancer, tumor
cells have been shown to recruit and stimulate macrophages
to secrete the TLR4 ligands S100A8/9 thereby reducing
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [115]. Although HCK
participates in the transduction of TLR4-dependent signals,
this study did not investigate HCK activity in recruited
macrophages. However, HCK activity either alone or
within the context of other SFKs often reduces the efficacy
of recombinant immunotoxins [66], where antibody
fragments are tethered to an exotoxin that induces apoptosis
upon antigene binding to the surface of tumor cells [116].
Accordingly, co-treatment of cells with the recombinant
immunotoxin SS1P and the SFK inhibitor Bosutinib
synergistically inhibited the growth of A431/H9 human
epithelial carcinoma cells, and also enhanced regression of
the corresponding tumor xenografts in mice [66].

HCK may be associated with reduced drug
efficacy in the clinic
The mechanism of action of most small molecule
kinase inhibitors depends on their binding into the
hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the ATP binding site
[117]. However, the accessibility of small molecule
inhibitors is often contingent on the presence of a small
amino acid (e.g. threonine) adjacent to the hydrophobic
pocket. Tyrosine kinase mutants that possess larger
amino acids (e.g. methionine) at this position can confer
clinical resistance, as exemplified in acquired resistance
to Imatinib, Gefitinib or Erlotinib [118–121]. Thus,
expression of a HCK threonine-to-methionine mutant in
BCR/ABL transformed myeloid cells confers resistance
against the apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of the
broad-spectrum SFK inhibitor A-419259 [118]. Since
HCK also interacts with the BCR/ABL fusion protein,
this may have clinical relevance, whereby Imatinib can no
longer bind to and inhibit the BCR/ABL fusion protein in
CML patients [55, 122].

Co-targeting SFKs in the clinic

HCK, alongside other SFKs, can also interfere
with drug efficacy by cooperating with receptor kinases
that play a major role in oncogenesis. Increased EGFR
expression is observed in many human malignancies of
epithelial origin, including colorectal cancer, non-small
cell lung cancer and brain cancer [123]. EGFR is partially
activated upon ligand binding and phosphorylation of its
C-terminal tail, but requires interaction with SFKs for full
activation. This induces a conformational change in the
SFK, resulting in its auto-phosphorylation and transient
activation [124]. In turn, SFKs phosphorylate EGFR on
an additional tyrosine (Y845), resulting in EGFR-mediated
proliferation of breast cancer cells via STAT5B [125].
Increased SFK activity is also observed in the NCI-H226
human lung squamous carcinoma cell line with acquired
resistance to the EGFR-inhibitor Cetuximab, and SFK
activity has been shown to cooperate with EGFR to
enhance survival via HER3 and PI3K/AKT signaling
[123]. Consistent with this, treatment of Cetuximabresistant cells with the SFK kinase and BCR/ABL
inhibitor Dasatinib restored Cetuximab sensitivity, while
simultaneous inhibition of SFKs and EGFR markedly
suppressed HER3 and PI3K/AKT signaling [123].
Together, these findings suggest that SFKs and EGFR
cooperate in acquired resistance to Cetuximab, providing a
strong rationale for combinatorial strategies against SFKs
and EGFR in the treatment of cancer.

Due to the prevalence of excessive SFK expression
in many human malignancies and its correlation with
a poorer prognosis, these kinases represent a readily
actionable therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer.
Several ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors with
significant activity against SFKs have been developed
(Table 3) [126–128]. However, preclinical tests have
revealed that the efficacy of these drugs on primary
tumors is variable and dependent on the level of SFK
deregulation [29, 129, 130].
Given the various roles of SFKs in cells of the tumor
stroma, SFK inhibitors have exhibited a great impact in
slowing tumor invasion and metastasis. For example,
combining the SFK and ABL inhibitor Saracatinib with
a MEK inhibitor prevented melanoma cell invasion [131]
and the metastatic outgrowth of dormant tumor cells
[132]. Likewise, the synergistic activity of Dasatinib with
Oxaliplatin promoted shrinkage of metastatic nodules as
a consequence of reduced proliferation and angiogenesis
[133]. Furthermore, Dasatinib treatment can restore the
aforementioned Cetuximab sensitivity of EGFR-positive
breast cancers, and also overcome BRAF inhibitor
resistance in melanoma cells [134]. It is therefore likely
that SFK inhibition may also provide benefit as adjuvant
therapy with current standard of care chemotherapies.

Future perspectives

CONCLUSIONS

To maximize the therapeutic benefit from
incorporating HCK (or SFK) inhibition into existing
cancer treatments, several challenges need to be addressed.
One major limitation is the lack of appropriate biomarkers
to monitor SFK deregulation in patients. This is crucial,
since the therapeutic efficacy of SFK inhibitors will be
influenced by the extent of SFK activity in tumors [29],
as well as other molecular alterations which may impact
on the response of cancer cells to SFK inhibitors [135].
To date, preclinical trials using SFK inhibitors have been
performed in unselected patients with relatively low
overall clinical benefits. However, favorable responses
have been observed when patients were stratified,
which emphasizes the importance of utilizing predictive
biomarkers to identify those individuals who will benefit
the most from SFK inhibitor therapy [136, 137].
Secondly, although SFK inhibition is effective in
some advanced tumors, particularly in combination with
treatments that target other tumor drivers such as HER2,
other clinical trials have reported limited benefits [138–
140]. For this reason, the use of SFK inhibitors in an
early adjuvant setting may be a more effective in delaying
the progression of emerging tumors rather than to treat
advanced/metastatic disease, since a significant impact of
many SFK inhibitors was associated with their capacity
to slow down tumor invasion and metastasis [131, 133].
Lastly, new strategies for the design of more
conformation specific SFK inhibitors are required, since
drugs with high specificity and potency are more
effective and exhibit fewer side effects and toxicity. In
particular, proteomic tools that interrogate kinase active
sites provide a powerful approach for studying protein
regulation and for performing screens for highly selective
inhibitors for components of complex proteomes [141].
One such new technique involves the use of probes that
harbor complimentary functionalities, including distinct
moieties to direct interaction to the active site, to facilitate
covalent binding once docked at the kinase active
site, and to provide chemo-selective tags for reporter
conjugation. When applied to HCK, this screening
strategies enabled rapid profiling of novel active sites in
the kinase domain and the identification of a number of
conformation-specific ATP competitive inhibitors [141].
An other approach exploited a library of pyrazolo[3, 4-d]
pyrimidine derivatives to identify candidates, which bind
to the ATP binding site of HCK [11]. These new ATPcompetitive inhibitors have structures distinct from any
class of existing HCK inhibitors and showed significant
inhibitory and anti-proliferative effects at sub-micromolar
concentrations [11]. Other emerging SFK inhibitors with
high specificity against HCK include A-419259 [118],
which blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis in CML
cell lines, as well as RK-20449 [142], which promotes
tumor regression in a mouse xenograft model.

An oncogenic role of HCK has been implicated in
human cancers, including leukemia and solid tumors of
the breast, colon and stomach. Given the high frequency of
excessive HCK activation in these cancers and its correlation
with a poor prognosis on one hand, and the relatively mild
phenotype displayed by HCKKO mice on the other hand,
HCK may be a promising target for cancer treatment. In
particular, therapeutic-targeting strategies aimed at inhibiting
HCK within the tumor stroma may be part of a paradigmshifting approach to treating human cancers in the future.
Given the role of stromal cells as key enablers and enhancers
of many of the hallmarks of cancer, we predict that the
inhibition of HCK in tumor-associated innate immune
cells will reduce their ability to promote angiogenesis,
inflammation, migration and invasion. This will be aided
by the emergence of new strategies to identify novel HCK
inhibitors with greater specificity and potency, which will
not only provide additional insights into the mechanistic by
which HCK promotes the progression of tumors, but facilitate
translational outcomes for cancer patients in the clinic.
