Abstract
Males have a higher incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) than females, but the reason for this gender
difference is unknown. Addressing this question, we report the discovery of an androgen receptor (AR)–
induced HIF2a/VEGF signal that drives RCC progression. AR attenuation or augmentation in RCC cells
altered their proliferation, migration, and invasion in multiple models in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that AR targeting inhibited RCC cell migration and invasion by modulating HIF2a/
VEGF signals at the level of mRNA and protein expression. Interrupting HIF2a/VEGF signals with inhibitors
of either HIF2a or VEGF was sufﬁcient to suppress RCC progression. Similarly, the speciﬁc AR degradation
enhancer ASC-J9 was sufﬁcient to suppress AR-induced HIF2a/VEGF signaling and RCC progression in
multiple models in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results revealed a novel role for AR in RCC
initiation and progression with implications for novel therapeutic strategies. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4420–30.

Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3%
of adult malignancies and 90% to 95% of kidney neoplasm (1).
Worldwide, incidence and mortality rates are reported to be
steadily rising at a rate of approximately 2% to 3% per decade
(2). Surgery remains the only effective treatment for RCC
because metastatic disease is usually resistant to radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, and immunotherapy shows limited
response rates of 15% to 20% (3). Although the development
of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy opens a new door
for advanced RCC patients, its effect is still limited for patients
with selective pathologic types (4). The search for a new and
better therapy via new targets for metastatic RCC is still
needed.

The lack of early warning signs and diverse clinical manifestations have made RCC a difﬁcult malignancy to diagnose
and treat, and the etiology of RCC is still largely unknown
although obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking,
and diet have been reported as potential risk factors for RCC
(5–9). Interestingly, early studies indicated that the gender
difference with male:female ratio in RCC incidence is 1.6:1.0
(5, 10), suggesting that sex hormones and/or their receptors
may play important roles for the development of RCC. However, few studies have linked the androgen receptor (AR) with
RCC initiation and progression.
Here, we found that AR might play positive roles to promote
RCC initiation, progression, and invasion via modulation of
HIF2a!VEGF signals. Targeting AR with the newly developed
AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9 (11–14) suppressed ARinduced HIF2a!VEGF signals that resulted in suppression
of RCC progression and might represent a new potential
therapeutic approach to suppress RCC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and stable cell lines
The human RCC cell lines SW839 (AR positive) and 769P and
786O (both AR negative) were purchased from ATCC, and the
normal human kidney proximal tubular cell line HKC-5 (AR
negative) was kindly provided by Dr. Syed Khundmiri from
University of Louisville (Louisville, KY), and maintained in
DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS in the 5% CO2 and 37 C
incubator. All cell lines have been tested and authenticated as
bacteria and mycoplasma free following ATCC's instructions
during the past 3 months.
The AR knocked-down stable clones of SW839 and
AR overexpressing 769P and 786O cells were transfected by

Targeting AR to Suppress Kidney Cancer Progression

AR-cDNA or AR-siRNA lentivirus according to our previous
study (15).
Cell transformation with soft agar colony formation
assay
The colony formation assay was described previously (16).
Brieﬂy, 10,000 cells were plated into 6-well plates. After 4 weeks,
cultures were examined with an inverted phase microscope at
100 and 200 for ﬁnal colony counts. The carcinogen Fe-NTA
was added at the concentration of 10 mmol/L into media of the
HKC5-AR and HKC5-VEC cells.
Cell proliferation assay
RCC cells were seeded in 24-well plates (3,000 cells/well) and
cultured for indicated time. Cells were harvested and cell
number was calculated using MTT agent.
Cell migration and invasion assay
The migration or invasion capability of RCC cells was
determined using the Transwell assay. Brieﬂy, cells were
harvested and seeded with serum-free media into the upper
chamber at 2  104 cells/well with or without coated Matrigel
(BD Corning). The migrated or invaded cells were ﬁxed by 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% toluidine blue. Cell
numbers were counted in ﬁve randomly chosen microscopic
ﬁelds (100) per membrane. When necessary, cells were
treated with an inhibitor of HIF2a (10 mmol/L, EMD Millipore,
CAS 882268–69–1) or VEGF (50 nmol/L, Flt2–11, EMD Millipore) for 48 hours.
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR have been described
previously (11). qRT-PCR was conducted using a Bio-Rad
CFX96 system with SYBR green to determine the level of mRNA
expression of each gene of interest.
Western blot analysis
The expressions of AR and their related proteins were
determined by the Western blot analysis according to the
previous study (16). All analyses were performed in triplicate.
Subcutaneous and renal capsule cells implantation
The mice xenograft procedures were performed as
described previously (16). In brief, 5106 or 1106 the FeNTA-transformed HKC5-AR cells, HKC5-Vec cells, human
RCC 786O-AR, and 786O-Vec cells were directly injected into
the renal capsule or subcutaneously injected in ﬂanks (in
order to monitor tumor growth and burden) of male nude
mice, respectively. The tumors grown in renal capsule were
harvested, measured, photographed, and ﬁxed for further
histopathological analyses.
IHC staining
IHC staining was conducted using the VECTASTAIN ABC
System (Victor Laboratories). Rabbit polyclonal antibody
against AR (N-20, 1:500 diluted) and rabbit anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (ab46154, 1:1,000 diluted) and mouse antiHIF2a monoclonal antibody (ab8365, 1:1500 diluted) were

www.aacrjournals.org

used. The slides were analyzed using an E800 microscope
(Nikon) and a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). The
scoring of IHC were performed by using semiquantitative
histologic scoring system (H-score; ref. 17). Five random ﬁelds
were recorded in each slide.
Luciferase reporter assays
The human promoter region of HIF2a was ampliﬁed and
cloned into the pGL3 vectors, and the luciferase reporter assays
were performed according to the methods used in a previous
study (18). The cells were lysed and the luciferase activity was
detected by the dual luciferase assay using pRL-TK-luciferase
as the internal control. Each sample was normalized by pRLTK-luciferase activity, and data were presented as mean  SE
from at least three independent experiments.
Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed by using the statistical software SPSS
for windows 10.0. The mean  SEM analysis was performed on
all parameters that were found to be signiﬁcant using the t test
or ANOVA test. P < 0.05 was considered the threshold value for
statistical signiﬁcance.

Results
AR enhanced the human kidney epithelial cell
tumorigencity
We ﬁrst applied the cell transformation assay via soft agar
colony formation to determine the roles of AR in kidney
tumorigenesis. The normal human kidney epithelial cells
stably transfected with AR (HKC5-AR) and vehicle Vector
(HKC5-Vec) were both transformed by carcinogen Fe-NTA
(10 mmol/L) for 4 weeks to form cell colonies in soft agar cell
culture dishes, and results showed that HKC5-AR cells had
signiﬁcantly higher colony formation capabilities as compared with those of transformed HKC5-Vec cells (Fig. 1A).
The quantitative data of both the colony numbers and
average diameter of each colony formed by transformed
HKC5-AR were also larger than those of transformed HKC5Vec (Fig. 1B and C). Together, results from Fig. 1A–C
indicated that the AR might play a positive role to promote
RCC initiation.
AR increased the proliferation rate of carcinogentransformed human normal kidney tubular epithelial
cells
We next assayed the AR effects on the early RCC development via the MTT growth assay with transformed human
kidney epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, little difference of
cell growth was found in the human kidney epithelial cells
(HKC5-AR) compared with vector control cells (HKC5-Vec).
However, after those human kidney epithelial cells were
transformed by carcinogen-Fe-NTA at the concentration of
5 or 10 mmol/L for 4 weeks, the proliferation rates of these
transformed-HKC5-AR cells were much higher than those of
transformed HKC5-Vec cells (Fig. 2B–C).
Together, results in Fig. 2A–C suggested that the AR not only
enhanced RCC initiation, but could also promote RCC cell

and early tumor development, but also plays positive roles to
promote the regular RCC cell growth.
AR promoted RCC cell migration and invasion in vitro
We next studied AR roles in RCC migration/invasion in
vitro. Using Transwell migration assays (19), we found that
by adding 1 or 10 nmol/L DHT and addition of AR in the RCC
769P cells (769P-AR) and 786O cells (786O-AR) resulted in
increased cell migration as compared with their Vector
control cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S1B). Interestingly, these AR-mediated RCC cell migration and invasion
can be further suppressed by adding 2.5 and 5 mmol/L
MDV3100 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). As expected, knocking
down AR in RCC (SW839-ARsi) cells decreased cell migration as compared with their scramble controls (SW839ARsc; Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S1B).
We then applied the Matrigel-coated invasion assay to
see whether AR could also inﬂuence RCC cell invasion and
results showed that the invasion ability of both 769P-AR and
786O-AR cells was increased compared with their vector
control cells (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S1B). Knocking
down AR in SW839-ARsi cells then decreased cell invasion as
compared with the scramble controls (SW839-ARsc).
Taken together, results from Fig. 3B and C and Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B all demonstrated that AR played positive
roles to promote RCC cell migration and invasion.
HIF2a!VEGF signal is a key player for AR-mediated cell
migration/invasion in RCC cells
To dissect the potential molecular mechanism(s) by
which AR could control RCC progression, we then applied
qPCR-based super-array analyses to globally search for the
key genes that could be important for AR function in RCC
progression. We found that addition of AR in 769P cells led
to signiﬁcantly increased expression of several invasion and
metastasis-related genes such as Kai-1, Serpinb, VEGF,
HIF2a, and SYK, etc. (Table 1). Among these AR-regulated

4424

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

genes, the transcription level of HIF2a and VEGF increased
dramatically (P < 0.01) in AR-positive RCC cells compared
with the AR-negative RCC cells, and importantly, these two
genes have drawn our attention since early studies have
demonstrated that HIF2a and VEGF could promote cancer
progression via angiogenesis (20) and they were also two of
the essential targets for the newly developed target therapy
for advanced RCC patients in clinic. We then applied the
Western blot analysis and qPCR assays to conﬁrm that these
two AR genes could be modulated by AR at protein (Fig. 4A)
and mRNA levels (Fig. 4B) in both 769P-AR and 786O-AR
cells.
Similar results were also obtained in SW839-ARsi cells
showing decreased HIF2a and VEGF protein (Fig. 4A) and
mRNA (Fig. 4B) as compared with SW839-ARsc cells.
Next, to link AR-modulated expression of HIF2a and VEGF
to the AR-mediated RCC cell invasion, we applied interruption
approaches using inhibitors of HIF2a (10 mmol/L, CAS 88226869-1, EMD Millipore) or VEGF (50 nmol/L Flt2–11, EMD
Millipore) for the cell invasion assay of 769P-AR, 786O-AR,
and SW839-ARsc cells. We found that addition of HIF2a
inhibitor or VEGF inhibitor alone suppressed the invasion of
769P-AR, 786O-AR, and SW839-ARsc cells (Fig. 4C), indicating
HIF2a and VEGF might play important roles in AR-mediated
RCC cell invasion.
Molecular mechanism dissection further found that AR
could modulate HIF2a at the transcriptional level in HKC-5,
786-O, and 769-P cells (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Interestingly, although we failed to ﬁnd AR response elements in the HIF2a promoter region that may allow AR to
directly modulate HIF2a in the promoter region, we found
that AR could function through downregulation of microRNA-145 to modulate the downstream HIF2a expression
(Supplementary Fig. S5; for a more detailed mechanism on
how AR functions through modulation of miR-145 to inﬂuence the RCC cell invasion, see Y. Chen and colleagues;
unpublished data).

Figure 4. HIF2a/VEGF was a key player for AR-mediated proliferation, migration, and invasion in RCC cells. The expression of AR, HIF2a, and VEGF protein (A)
and mRNA (B) levels in 786O-AR/Vec, 769P-AR/Vec, and SW839-ARsc/ARsi cells were detected by Western blot analysis and qPCR, respectively. The
invasion abilities of these AR-positive RCC cells (769P-AR, 786O-AR, and SW839-ARsc) were assayed upon treatment either with HIF2a (10 mmol/L) inhibitor
or VEGF inhibitor (50 nmol/L) for 48 hour (C, inhibitor vs. DMSO, mean  SEM, ANOVA;  , mean P < 0.01). ARE assay also demonstrated that AR could
modulate the transcription of HIF2a in HKC-5 cells (D, HIF2a-AR vs. HIF2a, mean  SEM, t test,  , P < 0.01).

Furthermore, as an early report also indicated that von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) was one of the key upstream regulators
for the HIF2a!VEGF signal, we were interested to see whether
AR could also go through VHL to modulate the HIF2a!VEGF
signals. However, the results revealed that AR could modulate
HIF–VEGF expression-independent VHL status (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Together, results from Fig. 4A–D and Supplementary Fig.
S4–S6 demonstrated that AR might go through modulation of
miR-145 to alter the HIF2a!VEGF to enhance RCC cell
invasion.
AR promoted RCC progression and invasion in RCC
xenografted mouse models
The entire above in vitro cell lines data demonstrated that
AR might play positive roles in promoting RCC initiation and
progression. We then decided to further conﬁrm these in vitro

www.aacrjournals.org

cell lines data with in vivo mouse results. We xenografted the
Fe-NTA–transformed normal kidney epithelial cells (HKC5AR/HKC5-Vec) and human renal carcinoma 786O-AR/Vec
RCC tumor cells into the male mice subcutaneously, and the
results indicated that AR could promote both the transformed
normal renal epithelial cells and the RCC cells to form bigger
tumors compared to vector tumors in these in vivo mouse
models (Fig. 5A and B).
To mimic in vivo RCC progression, we then applied the
second in vivo mouse model study by orthotopically xenografted those two pairs of RCC cell lines (Fe-NTA–transformed
HKC5-AR/HKC5-Vec cells and human renal carcinoma 786OAR/Vec cells) under the nude male mice kidney capsules and
the results showed that addition of AR in the Fe-NTA–transformed HKC5 cells led to relatively higher tumor formation
rate (three out of eight), compared with the control group (one

Figure 5. AR promotes RCC formation and progression in subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografted mouse models. Subcutaneous and orthotopic nude mice
models were established by implanting carcinogen transformed normal kidney epithelial cells HKC5-AR/Vec and RCC 786O-AR/Vec cells. The tumor
size of AR-positive transformed HKC5-AR cells (A and C; 1/8 for subcutaneous and 3/8 for orthotopic mice N=mice number) were observed compared with the
vector controls (A and C; 1/8 for both subcutaneous and orthotopic mice). Similar results were also found in mice receiving the 786O-AR/Vec cells
xenografts both subcutaneous (B; N=mice number) and orthotopic (D; N=mice number). More importantly, 2 out of 14 mice with orthotopically implanted
786O-AR cells formed diaphragm and hepatic hilar lymph node metastasis (D; yellow arrows in middle panel, diaphragm metastasis; yellow arrows in
bottom panel, hepatic hilar lymph node metastasis), which was not found in the control groups. The subcutaneous and orthotopic nude mice tumor tissue
samples were subsequently subjected to histologic characterization including AR, HIF2a, and VEGF IHC staining, and the results indicated that AR could
induce the expression of HIF2a and VEGF both in tumors formed from transformed HKC5-AR (E) and 786O-AR (G) cells with predominate cell nuclei
and cytoplasm staining, and the mean H-score of tumors formed by AR-positive cells compared with tumors formed by AR-negative cells

Targeting AR to Suppress Kidney Cancer Progression

RCC tumors from both transformed HKC5-AR (Fig. 5E and F)
and 786O-AR cells (Fig. 5G and H).
Taken together, in vivo data from tumor tissues formed by
transformed normal kidney epithelial HKC5-AR cells and
RCC 786O-AR cells both in subcutaneous and orthotopic
nude mouse model demonstrated that AR might promote
RCC growth and invasion via modulation of HIF2a!VEGF
signals.
New potential therapeutic approach via targeting AR
with ASC-J9 to suppress RCC progression
All above in vitro cell lines data and in vivo mice data
demonstrated that AR might play positive roles to promote
RCC initiation, proliferation, and invasion, suggesting that
targeting AR might be a potential effective therapy to
suppress RCC progression. We therefore decided to use
ASC-J9, a newly developed AR degradation enhancer that
could degrade AR in several selective types of tumor cells
with few side effects (11–13), to examine its therapeutic
effects on RCC.
We ﬁrst titrated the dose of ASC-J9 required to kill
RCC cells using the MTT assay (Fig. 6A) and soft agar colony
formation assay (Fig. 6B) and found that 2.5 mmol/L ASC-J9
effectively suppressed RCC initiation in the carcinogen FeNTA–transformed HKC5-AR cells. Similarly, the treatment
with ASC-J9 at the concentrations above 2.5 mmol/L could
also dramatically suppress the cell growth or migration and
invasion in the 786O-AR, 769P-AR, and SW839 RCC cell lines
(Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S7A–S7C). We also found
much fewer effects in AR-negative 786-O and 769-P cells with
the concentration of 2.5 and 5 mmol/L ASC-J9 (Supplementary
Fig. S7A–S7C). Importantly, we also observed that the proliferation and migration of 786O-AR and 769P-AR cells were
suppressed with 2.5 and 5 mmol/L ASC-J9 (Supplementary
Fig. S8A and S8B). Interestingly, we found that the higher
concentrations of ASC-J9 (from 5 to 10 mmol/L) were needed
to signiﬁcantly suppress the migration and/or invasion ability
of the AR-positive SW839 cells as well as 769P-AR and SW839ARsc cells, with better effects at 10 mmol/L (Fig. 6D and E).
We then tested ASC-J9 in vivo effects in the two RCC mouse
models. We injected ASC-J9 (75 mg/kg i.p. daily for 4 weeks)
into the mice with subcutaneously and orthotopically
implanted 786O-AR cells. As shown in the Fig. 6F and G,
ASC-J9 could dramatically suppress the RCC tumor growth
in the mice as compared with the vehicle injection control. In
contrast, ASC-J9 had little effects on AR-negative RCC tumor
growth (Supplementary Fig. S7D and S7E, right). We observed
little side effects, including weight loss or stress, in mice that
received ASC-J9 treatment.
As expected, IHC staining of tumors conﬁrmed that ASC-J9
could suppress the expression of AR and its related genes
HIF2a and VEGF expression in these two RCC mouse models
(Fig. 6H and I).
Finally, we applied classic androgen-deprivation therapy
(ADT) via surgical castration in male mice and, as expected,
signiﬁcantly suppressed RCC tumor growth as compared with
vehicle control or female mice (Supplementary Fig. S7D and
S7E, left).

www.aacrjournals.org

Together, results from Fig. 6A–I demonstrated that the
newly developed AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9 could suppress RCC progression with little side effects in both subcutaneous and orthotopic RCC mouse models, suggesting that
targeting AR with ASC-J9 could be a new potential therapy to
suppress RCC progression.

Discussion
An early study by Li and colleagues (21) found 60% RCC
incidence in male mice versus 5% RCC incidence in female
mice upon carcinogen Fe-NTA treatment for 420 days,
suggesting a gender difference might exist in RCC. Deguchi
and colleagues (22) also observed that the testosterone
treatment might increase the incidence of carcinogen FeNTA–induced RCC in the rat model, indicating sex hormone
signaling might contribute to the RCC development. However, the potential mechanisms for the gender difference are
still unclear. Massafra and colleagues (23) found sex hormones could regulate the lipid peroxidation through the
function of antioxidant activities and Fe-NTA is one kind of
nephrotoxicity as the consequence of lipid peroxidation that
induced the animal RCC. However, whether sex hormones,
especially AR signals, can impact the RCC development and
progression remains unclear.
Our results provided the ﬁrst in vitro and in vivo evidences
that targeting AR might represent a new therapy to better
suppress RCC progression. Interestingly, although early
studies with immunostaining for AR expression found AR
could be detected in various stages of RCC, yet the linkage of
AR expression to RCC tumor grade, clinical stage, and
disease-free survival rate remained unclear (24–26). Similar
results also occurred in prostate cancer showing that AR
expression was detected in most stages yet the linkage of AR
expression to prostate cancer tumor grade, clinical stage,
and disease-free survival rate remained unclear (27). One
possible explanation is that AR expression (via immunostaining) is not equal to AR functional assay results and many
AR mutations that lost AR function (yet still could be
detected by immunostaining) were found in prostate cancer
(28). It will be very interesting to ﬁnd whether AR mutation
(s) with lost function can be also detected in RCC in future
studies.
Early studies found that the increased HIF–VEGF expression was correlated to adverse survival of RCC, suggesting
that HIF–VEGF signaling might play very important roles in
RCC progression (29, 30). The VHL gene is one of the
important suppressors for the HIF–VEGF signals in the RCC
development, and 45% of metastatic RCC had the mutant or
lost VHL gene (30), which might lead to constitutively
activated HIF–VEGF signals to promote the RCC progression (29). Here, we identiﬁed the second key player (the AR)
to induce HIF–VEGF signals to promote RCC progression,
which might provide an alternative therapeutic approach to
suppress RCC progression.
Current immunotherapy using high-dose IL2 and/or TNFa
intervention for metastatic RCC treatment (31, 32), or applying
the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, such as soraﬁnib,

Figure 6. Targeting AR as a new potential therapeutic approach to suppress RCC progression. The proliferation and colony formation abilities of
HKC-AR cells were determined by treatment with 2.5 mmol/L ASC-J9. A and B, compared with DMSO control, inhibited AR-positive RCC 786O-AR,
769P-AR, and SW839-ARsc cell proliferation was assayed by treatment with serial titration dosages of ASC-J9 (C; >2.5 mmol/L), migration (D; >5 mmol/L;

using in vitro MTT and Transwell assays. In addition, similar in vivo tumor growth inhibition result by ASC-J9 was also conﬁrmed by using 75 mg/kg
ASC-J9 i.p. injection daily for 4 weeks both in subcutaneously (F; N=mice number) and orthotopically (G; N=mice number) 786O-AR implanted mice compared
with the control vehicle-treated mice. H, IHC staining showed AR, HIF2a, and VEGF in the tumor tissues from ASC-J9 injected mice compared with
vehicle control. I, the H-score was also calculated compared with the mice receiving the vehicle control injection.

Targeting AR to Suppress Kidney Cancer Progression

sunitinib, or bevacizumab (33), to suppress the HIF–VEGF
signals, all led to suppress the RCC progression. However, the
huge costs and side effects, such as neutropenia, anemia,
increased creatinine, thrombocytopenia, and hand-foot syndrome may become the stumbling block of these treatments
(34).
ASC-J9 is a newly developed AR degradation enhancer that
could degrade AR in selective cells with little side effects and
better efﬁcacy to suppress the tumor progression in prostate
cancer (15), bladder cancer (11), and liver cancer (12, 35). Here,
we demonstrated the high efﬁciency of ASC-J9 on suppressing
RCC progression in three RCC in vitro cell lines and two RCC
in vivo mouse models without obvious side effects. This new
therapeutic approach via targeting the AR-induced HIF–VEGF
signals may become a potential new therapy with better
efﬁcacy to suppress RCC progression.
In conclusion, we identiﬁed AR as a new key player to
promote the RCC progression and targeting AR with ASC-J9
to suppress AR-induced HIF2a–VEGF signals may help us to
develop a new therapy with better efﬁcacy to ﬁght RCC with
little side effects.

Correction: ASC-J9 Suppresses Renal Cell
Carcinoma Progression by Targeting an
Androgen Receptor–Dependent HIF2a/VEGF
Signaling Pathway
In this article (Cancer Res 2014;74:4420–30), which appeared in the August 15, 2014,
issue of Cancer Research (1), the authors found errors in Fig. 5G and Supplementary
Figs. S2B and S7A. These errors were due to mislabeling of the image ﬁles and errors in
assembling the ﬁnal ﬁgures. The authors regret these errors.
The online version of the article has been corrected and no longer matches the print.
