Abstract

Author Manuscript

Activation of cyclin E1, a key regulator of the G1/S cell-cycle transition, has been implicated in
many cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although much is known about the
regulation of cyclin E1 expression and stability, its post-transcriptional regulation mechanism
remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that nuclear factor 90 (NF90), a doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein, regulates cyclin E1 in HCC. We demonstrate that NF90
is upregulated in HCC specimens and that suppression of NF90 decreases HCC cell growth and
delays G1/S transition. We identified cyclin E1 as a new target of NF90 and found a significant
correlation between NF90 and cyclin E1 expression in HCC. The mRNA and protein levels of
cyclin E1 were downregulated upon NF90 knockdown. Suppression of NF90 caused a decrease in
the half-life of cyclin E1 mRNA, which was rescued by ectopic expression of NF90. Furthermore,
NF90 bound to the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of cyclin E1 mRNA in vitro and in vivo.
Knockdown of NF90 also inhibited tumor growth of HCC cell lines in mouse xenograft model.
Moreover, we showed that inhibition of NF90 sensitized HCC cells to the cyclin-dependent kinase
2 (CDK2) inhibitor, roscovitine. Taken together, downregulation of NF90 in HCC cell lines can
delay cell-cycle progression, inhibit cell proliferation, and reduce tumorigenic capacity in vivo.

These results suggest that NF90 has an important role in HCC pathogenesis and that it can serve as
a novel therapeutic target for HCC.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

NF90, also known as nuclear factors associated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
(NFAR1), is one of the major products of alternative splicing of the interleukin enhancer
binding factor 3 gene.1 NF90 was originally purified as a DNA-binding complex regulating
the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter.2 Further work revealed that NF90 regulates IL-2 mRNA
stability.3–5 In addition to its role in T cells, NF90 has also been shown to be involved in
several other biological processes, including RNA processing, protein translation, DNA
repair, host resistance to viral infections and mitosis.6–10 NF90 contains two conserved
dsRNA binding motifs and an RGG domain responsible for its association with AU-rich
elements (AREs), and post-transcriptionally regulate genes such as IL-2,Tau, VEGF, bcl-2,
MKR-1, MyoD, p21 and CDC2.3–5,11–16 Microarray analysis showed that NF110, an
alternative splice form of NF90, was overexpressed in malignant nasopharyngeal carcinoma
cells.17 NF90 was found to bind to 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) AREs of VEGF mRNA
to enhance mRNA stability and increase its effect on breast cancer angiogenesis.12 The
NF90/NF45 complex also mediates E6 oncogene expression in human papilloma virustransformed cervical carcinoma cells.18 Although the regulation and function of NF90 have
been extensively investigated, its role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression remains
poorly understood.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common solid tumors, has a high
incidence and mortality rate in many countries including China.19 Although many signaling
pathways have been implicated in HCC, the mechanism of liver carcinogenesis remains
unknown. It is crucial to determine the pathogenic genes and molecular mechanisms of HCC
formation to improve diagnosis of multiple stages of HCC and to facilitate drug
development with specific liver cancer targets.

Author Manuscript

Loss of growth control is a hallmark of cancer, including HCC. Major regulatory events
leading to cell proliferation occur in the G1 phase, including the uncontrolled expression of
cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclin E1, one of the most important cyclins,
specifically drives the G1/S-phase transition in cell-cycle progression. In a normal cell
cycle, cyclin E1 expression is restricted only to a very short period of time during the G1-toS transition. Cyclin E1 binds to and activates CDK2, leading to phosphorylation of
downstream substrates controlling the initiation of DNA replication and other S-phase
events. The activity of the cyclin E1/ CDK2 complex reaches the highest when the cyclin E1
protein level is at its peak.20 Because cyclin E1 is a crucial regulator of the G1/S transition,
dysregulation of its expression leads to uncontrolled cell growth and is often associated with
malignant transformation. Upregulation of cyclin E1 is found in a variety of human cancers
including breast, ovarian, colorectal and HCC.21–24 In addition, sustained high-level
expression of cyclin E1, but not cyclin D1 or cyclin A, can cause genome instability and
centrosome amplification, which is conducive to tumor formation.25

Most studies on the regulation of cyclin E1 have focused on gene amplification and
proteolysis.26,27 Recently, it was reported that HuR, an AU-binding protein (AUBP), can
post-transcriptionally regulate cyclin E1 in breast cancer by associating with cyclin E1
mRNA and regulating its stability.28 In this study, we found that NF90 is upregulated in
HCC tissues. NF90 regulates cyclin E1 mRNA stability in HCC through binding to its
3′UTR and there is a significant correlation between NF90 and cyclin E1 expression in
human HCC specimens. NF90 suppression in HCC cell lines delays the cell cycle in G1/S
transition, inhibits cell proliferation and reduces the tumourigenic capacity in vivo. These
results suggest an important new role of NF90 in HCC tumorigenesis and raise the
possibility that NF90 may be a new therapeutic target for HCC.

RESULTS
Author Manuscript

NF90 is upregulated in HCC
We determined the expression of NF90 in HCC specimens paired with the corresponding
neighboring normal tissues. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we found that
NF90 was significantly upregulated in >60% of the HCC specimens (27 of 45 cases
increased more than twofold) (Figure 1a). To confirm the qRT-PCR results, we also
assessed NF90 protein levels in 27 paired HCC specimens by western blot analysis. More
than 70% (21 of 27) cases exhibited higher protein levels of NF90 in the tumors compared
with their corresponding controls (Figure 1b). Thus, NF90 is upregulated in the majority of
HCC in comparison with neighboring normal tissues.
Knockdown of NF90 delays cell-cycle progression

Author Manuscript

To assess its potential role in HCC proliferation, we first knocked down NF90 expression
using RNA interference. As NF90 and the larger alternative splice variant NF110 might
have distinct functions, we selectively depleted either isoform. Western blot analysis
revealed that the expression patterns of the NF90 or NF110 proteins were similar in the
majority of the HCC cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1). We selected two HCC cell lines,
SMMC-7721 and QGY-7703, to perform the knockdown experiments. The targeted small
interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were able to selectively repress either the NF90
or NF110 isoforms in SMMC-7721 and QGY-7703 HCC cell lines (Figure 2a). Both HCC
cell lines with decreased NF90 expression had slower growth rates as judged by MTS (3(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)
assay. In contrast, we did not observe any significant effect on cell growth when NF110 was
knocked down in both HCC cell lines (Figure 2b).

Author Manuscript

Next, we carried out the flow cytometry and an apoptosis assay to determine whether the
decrease in cell proliferation upon NF90 knockdown was due to inhibition of cell-cycle
progression or cell death. Knockdown of NF90 resulted in an increase in the G1 population,
and a decrease in S-phase cells (Figure 2c). No obvious difference was observed in the subG1 phase cells, indicating that NF90 knockdown affected cell-cycle progression without
inducing apoptosis (data not shown). Consistent with these results, HCC cell lines with
stable knockdown of NF90 also showed G1/S-transition arrest and a slower growth rate than
the control cells (Figures 2d and e). These findings were further confirmed in colony

formation assays (Supplementary Figure 2). Together, these results suggested that NF90, but
not NF110, is required for HCC cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression.
NF90 regulates cyclin E1 expression
To search for putative NF90 target genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, we analyzed the
genes from the microarray data (Supplementary Table 2).16 We compared the levels of these
potential target genes and their family members between control cells and cells with
transiently decreased NF90 levels. As shown in Figure 3a, cyclin D1, cyclin E1 and MAPK6
mRNAs were consistently decreased by more than twofold in the two HCC cell lines upon
NF90 knockdown. Cyclin E1 protein levels were also significantly downregulated in the
NF90-knockdown cells (Figures 3b and c). Surprisingly, the level of cyclin D1 did not
change appreciably. These results suggested that cyclin E1, but not cyclin D1, is likely to be
the target of NF90 that mediates its effect on cell-cycle regulation.

Author Manuscript

To further confirm the relationship between NF90 and cyclin E1 expression in HCC in vivo,
we analyzed cyclin E1 mRNA expression in the identical 45 paired human HCC tissues as
mentioned above. A statistically significant correlation (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) was observed
between the NF90 and cyclin E1 genes (Figure 3d). We also investigated NF90 and cyclin
E1 protein levels in seven paired HCC specimens selected randomly, which also displayed a
significant correlation (Figure 3e).
NF90 regulates the half-life of cyclin E1 mRNA

Author Manuscript

Previously, we showed that IL-2 mRNA is regulated by NF90 at the mRNA level through its
AREs. The cyclin E1 3′UTR also contains several ARE sequences,28 raising the possibility
that its mRNA stability could also be regulated by AUBP. To determine whether cyclin E1
mRNA stability is affected upon NF90 knockdown, we blocked transcription and then
analyzed cyclin E1 mRNA decay. The t1/2 of cyclin E1 mRNA in SMMC-7721 cells
decreased from 2.03 ± 0.38 h to 0.69 ± 0.17 h or 0.65 ± 0.10 h when NF90 was knocked
down. Similarly, the t1/2 of cyclin E1 mRNA declined from 3.77 ±0.16 h to 1.17 ± 0.23 h or
2.50 ±0.31 h upon NF90 knockdown in the QGY-7703 cell line (Figure 4a). To ensure the
specificity of knockdown of NF90, we expressed an RNA interference-resistant version of
Myc-tagged NF90 in cells stably suppressing NF90 and observed restoration of cyclin E1
expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4b, lanes 3 and 4). The half-life of cyclin E1
mRNA was increased when NF90 was restored (Figure 4c). The distribution of the G1/Sphase populations was also partially recovered (Supplementary Figure 3). These data
suggested that NF90 is required for stabilizing cyclin E1 mRNA.

Author Manuscript

NF90 binds to the 3′UTR of cyclin E1 mRNA
The finding that cyclin E1 mRNA stability was regulated by NF90 prompted us to determine
whether NF90 is bound to the 3′UTR of cyclin E1 mRNA. To assess the association
between NF90 and the cyclin E1 3′UTR, we conducted an in vitro RNA pull-down assay
and a ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assay. First, we made constructs with the
3′UTR of IL-2, cyclin D1, cyclin E1 and three 3′UTR truncations of cyclin E1 mRNA
(Figure 5a). qRT-PCR was performed to examine RNA enrichment in the protein-RNA
complex pulled down by GST-NF90Δ, containing only two dsRNA-binding domains

recombined with a GST tag (Supplementary Figure 4). As shown in Figure 5b, the in vitro
transcribed cyclin E1 3′UTR was greatly enriched in the GST-NF90Δ pull-down complex,
even more than the positive control—the IL-2 mRNA 3′UTR. Moreover, three 3′UTR
truncation fragments of cyclin E1 mRNA could be bound by GST-NF90Δ, but significantly
less than the wild-type sequence. In contrast, no apparent enrichment was observed for the
cyclin D1 3′UTR.

Author Manuscript

Commercial antibodies of NF90 recognize not only NF90 but also NF110 isoforms, which
can also bind mRNA via the same dsRNA-binding domain. To avoid NF110
immunoprecipitation artifacts, we established a Hep3B cell line that stably expressed
exogenous Myc-tagged NF90 (terminal) protein and used it for ribonucleoprotein
immunoprecipitation assays with anti-Myc antibodies (Figure 5c). Cyclin E1 mRNA was
seen in the samples pulled down with Myc antibodies but not with the IgG control. And we
could not detect any PCR product of the cyclin D1 mRNA 3′UTR. Moreover,
overexpression of NF90 increased cyclin E1 protein expression, proliferation rate and G1/S
progression compared with the control (Supplementary Figure 5). These results supported
the notion that NF90 specifically binds to the cyclin E1 mRNA 3′UTR both in vitro and
under physiological conditions.
Knockdown of NF90 decreases tumor growth in vivo

Author Manuscript

The finding that NF90 promoted proliferation of HCC cells in vitro prompted us to
determine whether it exerts a similar effect in vivo. Control or NF90-knockdown cell lines
were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. NF90 knockdown resulted in a significant
decrease in the volume and weight of tumors (Figures 6a–c). NF90 and cyclin E1 mRNA
levels were decreased in the tumor samples from the NF90-knockdown cell line xenografts
(Figure 6d). Ki-67, a cell proliferation marker, was almost undetectable in NF90-knockdown
xenografts (Figure 6e). These results indicated that downregulation of NF90 inhibits the
growth of HCC tumors by repressing in vivo cell proliferation.
NF90 knockdown sensitizes HCC cells to the CDK inhibitor roscovitine

Author Manuscript

There are currently effective treatments for HCC, due in large part to a high level of
resistance to various chemotherapeutic drugs. We thus determined whether the upregulation
of NF90 contributed to the resistance of HCC cells to chemotherapy. We tested eight
commonly used antineoplastic drugs as well as the CDKs inhibitor roscovitine (Selleck,
Houston, TX, USA). No obvious difference was observed between cells with decreased
NF90 and controls after treatment with any of the agents except for roscovitine (Figure 7a).
Roscovitine, a potent and selective inhibitor targeting cyclin E/CDK2, cyclin B/ CDK1 and
cyclin A/CDK2, has undergone phase II clinical trials.29–31 We also examined whether
NF90 knockdown sensitized HCC cells to roscovitine-induced cell death. As shown in
Figure 7b, the IC50 of 7721-2 was 33.8 ± 1.57 µM and therefore was more sensitive than the
control 7721-C (IC50 = 49.4 ± 5.02 µM) after roscovitine treatment. This difference was more
pronounced in QGY-7703 stable cell lines (IC50 of QGY-4 = 15.8 ± 1.94 µM and IC50 of
QGY-C = 37.3 ± 1.04 µM). The IC50 for sorafenib did not significantly change. These results
suggested that NF90 suppression also decreases the resistance of HCC cell lines to
roscovitine.

DISCUSSION
NF90 was originally identified as a post-transcriptional regulator of IL-2 mRNA through
binding to the ARE of 3′UTR. However, its function is not restricted to T cells, as it has also
been found to regulate a number of other mRNAs and to be involved in the regulation of cell
proliferation. In this study, we found that NF90 is upregulated in HCC and its expression
increases HCC growth both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified cyclin E1 as a
novel target of NF90. NF90 stabilized cyclin E1 mRNA through binding to its 3′UTR,
enhancing cyclin E1 expression and promoting cell proliferation.

Author Manuscript

The binding of NF90 to the 3′UTR of its target mRNA can have distinct consequences on
gene expression. In the case of IL-2, NF90 binding to the AREs of IL-2 mRNA leads to its
stabilization and an increase in IL-2 protein level.3–5 For a subset of NF90 target mRNAs,
however, NF90 binding leads to the inhibition of translation, decreasing protein levels of the
target mRNA.16 The effect of NF90 on cyclin E1 mRNA is similar to that on IL-2, as
upregulation of NF90 was associated with increases in both RNA and protein levels of
cyclin E1, while downregulation led to a decrease in cyclin E1 mRNA and protein levels.

Author Manuscript

It has been previously reported that repression of either NF90 or its binding partner NF45,
but not NF110, leads to retardation of HeLa cell growth and accumulation of multinucleate
giant cells.10 However, the underlying mechanism has remained undefined. Similar to that
observation, we found that knockdown of NF90 decreased the growth of HCC cell lines and
caused G1/S arrest (Figures 2b and c). Moreover, we identified cyclin E1, but not cyclin D1,
as a target gene of NF90 after screening-related cell-cycle genes (Figures 3a–c).
Upregulation of NF90 is closely correlated with elevation of cyclin E1 in human HCC
specimens (Figures 3d and e). The association between NF90 and cyclin E1 might explain
the G1/S arrest after the NF90 silencing in HCC cells and may explain the increased cyclin
E1 levels in some HCC. Although cyclin D1 mRNA also decreased upon knockdown of
NF90, cyclin D1 protein levels did not change appreciably. The decreased mRNA levels of
cyclin D1 may have resulted from a secondary effect after downregulation of NF90. It
remains to be determined how cyclin D1 protein, unlike its mRNA, remained unchanged.

Author Manuscript

A number of mRNA targets of NF90 have been reported to date, some of which are also
known to be involved in the regulation of cell-cycle progression including p21 and
CDC2.15,16 The decrease of p21 in NF90(−/−) mice resulted in an increase in apoptosis,
which led to a remarkable decrease in mature skeletal muscle fibers.15 However, another
report indicated that silencing the NF90/NF45 complex induced p21 and apoptosis by E6/
E6AP-p53 pathway only in HeLa cells, not in non-HPV cervical carcinoma and non-cervical
carcinoma cells.18 NF90 prevented the translation of CDC2, cyclin A and cyclin I, but had
no obvious influence on the stability and concentration of their mRNAs. Silencing NF90
increased these proteins and moderately enhanced DNA replication.16 We also observed no
change in the abundance of CDC2, cyclin A and cyclin I mRNAs in the NF90-knockdown
cells (Supplementary Table 2).
Cyclin E1 has an important role in the proliferation of tumor cells, and cyclin E1
overexpression has been reported to have myriad effects on transcription and post-

transcriptional events. Consistent with previous reports that NF90 functions as an AUBP to
regulate IL-2 or VEGF,3–5,12 our results suggested that NF90 regulates cyclin E1 in the
same manner. We showed that altering NF90 levels had a clear effect on the half-life of
cyclin E1 mRNA (Figure 4). The regulation of mRNA stability is an important element of
eukaryotic gene expression, particularly for acute phase genes with unstable mRNA. Cyclin
E1 can quickly respond to growth factor stimulation and its 3′UTR contains multiple AREs,
raising the possibility that its mRNA is regulated via these elements. In support of this, HuR,
an AUBP, can stabilize cyclin E1 mRNA by binding to its 3′UTR AREs.28 Our studies
revealed that NF90, another member of the AUBP family, also directly binds to the 3′UTR
of cyclin E1 mRNA in its 3′UTR region in vitro and in vivo (Figures 5b and c), which
enhances its stability in the HCC cell lines.

Author Manuscript

Through the xenograft assay, we found that the tumorigenic capacity of HCC cell lines in
nude mice was decreased upon NF90 knockdown (Figure 6), suggesting that NF90 has an
important role in HCC tumor formation in vivo. These results suggested that NF90 may
serve as a new target for developing anti-HCC drugs. Furthermore, we searched for synergy
between NF90 knockdown and existing anticancer drugs. Interestingly, among nine drugs or
drug candidates, NF90 only enhanced the cytotoxic effect of roscovitine on HCC in vitro. In
retrospect, this unique effect of NF90 knockdown can be explained by its effect on cyclin E1
mRNA. As roscovitine functions by inhibiting multiple CDKs including cyclin E/CDK2, it
is not surprising that a concurrent decrease in cyclin E1 expression level as a consequence of
NF90 knockdown would enhance the antitumor activity of roscovitine.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our findings suggest that regulation of cyclin E1 mRNA stability by NF90 is
responsible for liver cancer progression. Clarification of the mechanism accounting for the
synergy between NF90 knockdown and roscovitine might provide a new therapeutic
approach for the treatment of HCC in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor specimens
Fresh surgical specimens of HCC, including tumor tissues and the neighboring
pathologically non-tumorous liver tissue, were obtained from liver cancer patients at the
Qidong Liver Cancer Institute (Jiangsu province, China). All samples were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen after surgery and then later stored at −80 °C before further analysis.
Western blot

Author Manuscript

Protein samples were separated by SDS–PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After blocking, the membranes were incubated
with specific antibodies against different proteins at room temperature for 2 h or 4 °C
overnight, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies. Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemilumines-cence (GE
Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Antibodies were against NF90 (interleukin enhancer

USA), cyclin E1 (Epitomics), cyclin D1 (Epitomics), Myc (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), hactin (Sigma) and GAPDH (Sigma).
siRNA transient transfection
siRNA targeting NF90 or NF110 was synthesized by Genepharma (Shanghai, China). The
siRNA oligo sequences for NF90 are si90-1: 5′-CAGCGUUGUUCGGCAUCAA-3′,12
si90-2: 5′-CAGACUGCUACGGCUA UCA-3′;10 the siRNA oligo sequences for NF110 are
si110: 5′-GGAU GUUGUCACAGCUAGU-3′.12 The sequence of the negative control is
non-silence: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′ (Genepharma). Human HCC cells were
transfected with siRNA at a final concentration of 100nM using LipofectAMINE 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
knockdown efficiency was determined by western blotting.

Generation of stable cell line
For the generation of stable cell lines, we purchased lentiviral stocks from Geneparma,
produced by cotransfection of 293T cells with recombinant lentiviral shRNA vector (pGLVU6-Puro) containing the NF90 target sequence (si90-1) and the negative control,
respectively. Stably transduced SMMC-7721 or QGY-7703 cells were selected using
puromycin, adding the minimum concentration of puromycin required to kill untransduced
cells. Individual colonies with NF90 knockdown were isolated and confirmed by green
fluorescence and western blotting. Stable control colonies were also generated in parallel.
Since surviving individual colonies with NF90 knockdown were very few, we randomly
selected two colonies in each cell line (named 7721-2 and 7721-3, QGY-4 and QGY-6). We
also randomly mixed 10 control colonies of each cell line (named 7721-C and QGY-C).

Author Manuscript

The NF90 cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1a (−)
(Invitrogen) containing a Myc tag and neomycin resistance gene for establishment of stable
transfectants. After selection with G418 and detection by western blotting, 10 randomly
selected colonies expressing NF90-Myc were combined (named Hep3B-NF90). Control
colonies were generated in parallel (named Hep3B-MV).
Cell proliferation assays
All cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well. During a 7-day
culture period, cells were subjected to MTS (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) assay every 2
days. The absorbance of each well was measured at 2.5 h after incubation by a microtiter
reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 450 nm. Results are representative of three
independent experiments with six samples for each cell.

Flow-cytometry analysis
For cell-cycle analysis, cells were harvested and resuspended in 70% ice-cold alcohol for
fixation overnight. DNA was stained with propidium iodide (50 µg/ml) together with RNase
treatment (100 µg/ml) before being analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). At least 10
000 cells were acquired for each sample. Results are representatives of three independent
experiments with triplicate samples for each condition.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues or cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen),
and 1–2 µg of RNA was applied for reverse transcription using an oligo dT primer
(Invitrogen) and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR analysis was conducted using
a SYBR Green Supermix kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with a Light Cycler 480 II (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). Properly diluted cDNA was used in a 10-µl qRT-PCR in triplicate for
each gene. The cycle parameters were 95 °C for a 1-min hot start and 45 cycles of 95 °C for
10 s, 60 °C for 10 s and 720 °C for 20 s. Blank controls with no cDNA templates were
performed to rule out contamination. The specificity of the PCR product was confirmed by
melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis. Gene expression levels were normalized to
the β2MG housekeeping gene. The primers for each gene are shown in Supplementary Table
2.

Half-life of cyclin E1 mRNA
For mRNA stability measurements, samples were treated with actinomycin D (5 µg/ml).
Total RNA was extracted at the indicated time points following addition of actinomycin D.
Cyclin E1 mRNA expression levels were normalized to 18s RNA or RPLP0.
RNA pull-down assay using recombinant proteins
Plasmids were digested with BamH1 to linearize the vectors and purified. Biotin-labeled

(Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA), and 400 units/ml RNase inhibitor). The suspensions
were incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation, supernatant was precleared using
10µl of protein A sepharose (NaCl was added to a final concentration of 200 mM), followed
by addition of yeast tRNA (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA) to a final concentration of 40
µg/ml. The cleared supernatant was transferred to tubes containing antibody or IgG-coated
beads, and IP was carried out by rotating the tubes at 4 °C for 4 h. Following IP, the beads
were washed with IP buffer containing 10 µg/ml yeast tRNA.32 RNA extraction and reverse
transcription were performed as mentioned above. Cyclin E1 3′UTR fragments were
detected by two specific primers (Supplementary Table 1).
In vivo assays for tumor growth

Author Manuscript

Four- to six-week old BALB/c nu/nu mice obtained from the Institute of Materia Medica
(CAS, Shanghai, China) were bred and maintained in our institutional pathogen-free mouse
facilities. To determine the role of NF90 on HCC growth in vivo, 4×106 cells of
SMMC-7721 or QGY-7703 stable cell lines suspended in 200 µl of PBS were implanted into
the flank of nude mice. The tumor volumes were measured every 3 days from the sixth day
after implantation.
Immunohistochemistry analysis

Author Manuscript

Frozen samples were cut into 4 µm slides and hydrated. Tissue sections were fixed with precooled acetone (−20 °C) for 10 min. After acetone evaporation, slides were rinsed with PBS,
and then incubated with 0.3% H2O2 solution in PBS at room temperature for 10 min to
block endogenous peroxidase activity. After adding blocking buffer (10% fetal bovine
serum in PBS) onto the sections, the slides were incubated in a humidified chamber at room
temperature for 1 h. After PBS wash, slides were incubated with Ki-67 (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with biotinylated secondary
antibodies for 1 h both in a humidified condition. 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI,
Sigma) was used for nuclear staining.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

For qRT-PCR, the relative gene expression levels normalized by β2-microglobulin (β2MG)
were calculated by the formula 2−ΔCt, where the ΔCt (critical threshold) = Ct of genes of
interest − Ct of β2MG. For the analysis of HCC specimens, fold changes of gene expression
levels in the tumor specimens relative to the corresponding non-tumorous specimens (T/N)
were calculated by the 2−ΔΔct method and transformed to log 2, where ΔΔCt = ΔCttumor −
ΔCtnonturnorous. A twofold change threshold was set for identifying significant changes in
gene expression. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software
(GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA, USA). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the
group-level differences. We considered P < 0.05 (*), P < 0.01 (**) and P < 0.001 (***) to
be statistically significant.
