ABSTRACT
The lack of effective treatment modalities is a major problem in pancreatic cancer
(PCa), a devastating malignancy that is nearly universally driven by the “undruggable”
KRAS and TP53 cancer genes. Poor tumor tissue penetration is the major source of
resistance in pancreatic cancer where chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. In
this study we exploited the selective tumor-targeting properties of the heat shock 90
protein inhibitors as the vehicle for drug delivery to pancreatic tumor tissues. STA12-8666 is a novel esterase-cleavable conjugate of an HSP90i and a topoisomerase
I inhibitor, SN-38. STA-12-8666 selectively binds activated HSP90 and releases its
cytotoxic payload resulting in drug accumulation in pancreatic cancer cells in vivo.
We investigated the preclinical activity of STA-12-8666 in patient derived xenograft
and genetic models of pancreatic cancer.
Treatment with STA-12-8666 of the KPC mice (knock-in alleles of LSL-KrasG12D,
Tp53fl/fl and Pdx1-Cre transgene) at the advanced stages of pancreatic tumors doubled
their survival (49 days vs. 74 days, p=0.008). STA-12-8666 also demonstrated
dramatically superior activity in comparison to equimolar doses of irinotecan against
5 patient-derived pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts with prolonged remissions in
some tumors. Analysis of activity of STA-12-8666 against tumor tissues and matched
cell lines demonstrated prolonged accumulation and release of cytotoxic payload in
the tumor leading to DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest.
Our results provide a proof-of-principle validation that HSP90i-based drug
conjugates can overcome the notorious treatment resistance by utilizing the inherently
high affinity of pancreatic cancer cells to HSP90 antagonists.

chemotherapy [2]. Clinical trials addressing this glaring
need for expanded portfolio of anti-cancer agents active in
PDAC have been unsuccessful [3]. Investigations of antiangiogenesis [4] or EGF receptor targeting [5] produced
responses in some individuals while overall comparisons
failed to demonstrate improvements statistically. In
part, the sluggish progress in the field is due to the
biology of PDAC which is nearly universally driven by

“undruggable” and interdependent mutations in KRAS,
P53 [6]. In response to the urgent need for transformative
treatments in PDAC, screening for potentially effective
agents has been streamlined with the use of preclinical
models closely representative of clinical PDAC such
as primary patient-derived xenografts and genetically
engineered mouse models [7, 8]. These clinically
predictive models of pancreatic cancer are poised to
overcome the deficiencies of the in vitro propagated and
“plastic-adapted” cell lines [9].
The delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy to the
tumor bed has been the “holy grail” of pancreatic cancer
research [10]. Attempts to dismantle the fibroblastic
stroma by blocking sonic hedgehog signaling [10] was a
disappointing failure in the clinic [11] despite the initial
improvement of gemcitabine penetration. Reprogramming
to quiescence of the stellate fibroblast cells through
application of vitamin D has shown some improvement in
drug delivery [12] although the view on the PDAC stroma
has shifted to being a restraint of carcinoma growth instead
of being a physical chemotherapy “barrier”[13–15]. We
chose to pursue a different route by exploiting a natural
dependency of cancer cells [16, 17], and PDAC in
particular [18–20], on the activity of HSP90. Here, we
report the results of preclinical evaluation of STA-128666, a small molecule drug conjugate in which a selective
HSP90 inhibitor is paired with a topoisomerase I inhibitor
SN-38 via an esterase-cleavable chemical linker [21, 22].
Our results provide evidence for highly promising STA12-8666 activity against pancreatic cancer models.

over time upon release of SN-38 following cleavage of the
ester bond (Figure 1A). Using established IC50 values, we
then compared the effects of STA-12-8666, ganetespib and
CPT11 on their intended targets in KPC cells following
24 hour of drug exposure. STA-12-8666 robustly induced
expression of pS139-H2AX associated with DNA damage
response (Figure 1C). Furthermore, expression of the S824phosphorylated form of KAP1 (Figure 1C, 1D), which is an
established target of ATM in response to DNA strand breaks
[23, 24] and a biomarker of TOP1 inhibition by STA-128666 [25] has been significantly upregulated in CPT11 and
STA-12-8666-treated cells. This was not observed in the
vehicle or HSP90 inhibitor treated cells suggesting a direct
activity of STA-12-8666 to induce DNA damage response.
Conversely, increased expression of HSP70, a biomarker
of HSP90 inhibition [16], was induced by STA-12-8666
at the levels comparable to a selective HSP90 inhibitor,
ganetespib, used here as a positive control. The release
of SN-38 from the conjugated STA-12-8666 compound
takes a slow course due to the requirement for cellular
esterase activity for the cleavage of the carbamoyl linker:
the observed accumulation of KPC cells arrested in G2/Mphase of the cell cycle in vitro was notable only after 48
hours of incubation with STA-12-8666 as opposed to a
more rapid effect of CPT11 (Figure 1E).

STA-12-8666 improves survival in mice with
spontaneous pancreatic carcinoma
KPC mice carrying a knock-in allele of LSL-KrasG12D
and a “floxed” allele of Tp53fl/fl in combination with the
pancreas-selective Pdx1-Cre transgene is a commonly
used genetic murine model for human pancreatic cancer
[26] which recapitulates the cardinal features of the
human disease including resistance to chemotherapy and
development of dense desmoplastic stroma surrounding
the carcinoma cells. The activation of oncogenic KrasG12D
expression and deletion of Tp53 in these animals is occurring
during fetal development due to the constitutive activity
of Pdx1-Cre transgene [27]. Untreated animals rapidly
succumb to the locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic
carcinoma with median survival in our colony around
7 weeks of age. Treatment with STA-12-8666 starting
at weeks 5 of age doubled the survival of KPC animals
(Figure 2A, 49 days in vehicle vs. 74 days in STA-12-8666
group, Kaplan-Meyer log rank test, p=0.008). The animals
experienced no apparent toxicity during the treatment.
Histochemical evaluation of the liver, kidney or pancreatic
tissues collected from 7 week old tumor bearing mice 7 days
following administration of a single dose of STA-12-8666 or
an equivalent dose of irinotecan demonstrated significantly
lower incidence of pS139-H2AX-positive nuclei (indicative
of DNA-damage response [28]) in the STA-12-8666-treated
animals in comparison to the irinotecan group in keeping
with the established tissue toxicity of SN-38 (Figure
2B, Supplementary Figure S1). We assessed apoptosis

RESULTS
STA-12-8666 is a dual HSP90 and topoisomerase
I inhibitor
Heat shock protein 90 is a critical chaperone to
maintain the integrity of the oncogenic signaling in cancer
[16, 17]. The activated HSP90 protein in complexes
with other co-chaperons has higher affinity for HSP90
selective inhibitors [17]. By design, STA-12-8666 is a
dual inhibitor of topoisomerase I (TOP1) and HSP90
(Figure 1A). However, the activity of SN-38 against
TOP1 can only be exerted when SN-38 is released from
the chemical bond by the cellular esterase activity [21,
22]. Using a mouse pancreatic carcinoma cells derived
from the KPC (genotype LSL-KrasG12D;Tp53f/f;Pdx1Cre) tumor at early passages (P8-10), we tested STA-128666 activity against both cellular targets. Assessment of
an in vitro cytotoxicity of STA-12-8666 and structurally
comparable inhibitors of HSP90 (ganetespib) or TOP1
(camptothecin, CPT11) demonstrated that the conjugate
has approximately 10-fold higher cytotoxic concentration
of 50% (IC50) in comparison to CPT11 (Figure 1B). We
believe this difference is related to STA-12-8666 being a
pro-drug, so that the cytotoxicity of the conjugate is exerted

enumerations of DNA damage response (Figure 2B), there
was nearly 4-fold better apoptosis induction selectivity of
STA-12-8666 towards the pancreatic tumor in comparison
to irinotecan (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure S2).
Histological evaluation of pancreatic tumors
demonstrated increased expression of nuclear pS139H2AX in the pre-neoplastic lesions (acinar-to-ductal

We further validated the activity of STA-12-8666
on a representative panel (Figure 3A) of early passage

cancer surgical samples. All but one tumor carried
KRAS and TP53 mutations. One model, PNX001, was
characterized by homozygosity for the hypomorphic

DISCUSSION

week) showed markedly superior activity in comparison
to irinotecan (50 mg/kg) given on the same schedule
(Figure 3B). In PNX001 the effect was dramatic, with
complete tumor regression after 3 weekly injections
in all treated animals. Complete responses were also
observed in the PXN050 model and lasted more than
one month (Figure 3B). Comparing tumor sizes 3
weeks post irinotecan or STA-12-8666 treatment clearly
illustrate the superior efficacy obtained with the drug
conjugate (Figure 3C). As in our experiments with the
transgenic pancreatic cancer model (Figure 2), we did
not observe any apparent toxicity in animals treated with
STA-12-8666 as reflected in their stable body weight
(Figure 3D) and behavior.
Histological analyses of pancreatic carcinoma
xenografts treated with a single injection of irinotecan
or STA-12-8666 demonstrated robust induction of DNA
damage response biomarkers consistent with its superior
in vivo efficacy (Figure 4).

Treatment of pancreatic cancer is challenging
due to the lack of effective agents and the resistance to
chemotherapy attributable to a greatly reduced blood
supply and the desmoplastic stromal response which
prevents achieving therapeutically active concentrations
for the most administered agents in the tumor bed.
Strategies to enhance drug penetration and retention
in the tumor bed have been actively pursued in the
clinic and proved to be effective as in the case of nabpaclitaxel, the first FDA-approved drug conjugate made
of paclitaxel bound to albumin particles [31]. A number
of other mechanisms to improve the delivery of cytotoxic
payload are under investigation including antibody-SN-38
conjugates, sacituzumab [32], milatuzumab [33] and
epratuzumab [34], and polymer-conjugated irinotecan
[35]. Despite some advantages of controlled release of
the cytotoxic payload, such delivery strategies are limited

by the paucity of vascular supply in the pancreatic tumor
and the large molecular weight of the protein carriers
which restricts their ability to penetrate to the tumor. The
strategy that has been pursued here is novel in its design
of a small hybrid molecule (MW=880 Da) that is capable
of penetrating the tumor and, importantly, also retained
in the malignant cells through interaction with activated
Hsp90 [22].
To validate the preclinical efficacy of STA-128666, we employed a platform of KPC mice genetically
induced to generate rapidly progressive pancreatic

carcinoma and a series of patient pancreatic tumor tissues
explants. Our results provide the proof-of-principle
indication that small molecule targeting of proteins
selectively activated in cancer but not in normal tissues
may be a highly effective drug delivery strategy. HSP90
is an ideal candidate for such an approach [17]. Besides
SN-38 used in STA-12-8666 conjugate as a “partner”
drug, other cytotoxic or imaging compounds can be
covalently attached to the HSP90-inhibitory moiety to
provide a versatile delivery system tailored to essentially
any cancer type.

The observed activity of STA-12-8666 against
pancreatic carcinoma models is impressive. Not only did we
observed extended survival of the KPC tumor-bearing mice,
but also complete and sustained regression of xenografted
PDX tumors suggesting the ability of the conjugate to be
selectively retained in pancreatic cancer and to be gradually
released to produce an irreversible DNA damage via TOP1
inhibition. In contrast to conventional irinotecan, STA-128666 had minimal effect on the benign tissues in mice as
confirmed by the absence of DNA damage response or
apoptosis induction with in vivo imaging (Figure 2). We
also note that in our recent study, we tested these PDX
models against conventional chemotherapy currently in
use in pancreatic cancer [8]. The tumor growth inhibition
demonstrated here with STA-12-8666 by far supersedes
the effect of most active chemotherapy showing only about
50% tumor growth inhibition (mitomycin C, gemcitabine,
nab-paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and irinotecan among tested
drugs). Of interest, in two PDX models showing the greatest
sensitivity to STA-12-8666 and irinotecan (PNX001 and
PNX050 in Figure 3), we identified polymorphisms of
UGT1A1 gene which is responsible for glucuronidedependent inactivation of SN-38. In vivo, the hepatic
conversion of CPT11/irinotecan to SN-38 is responsible
for the dose-limiting toxicity of the drug [36]. Similarly to
CPT11, STA-12-8666 is being activated by cellular esterase
thus releasing the SN-38 payload. However, the key
difference between the two pro-drugs is that STA-12-8666
accumulates preferentially in the tumor cells because of the
bond with the HSP90-targeting moiety. This differential
uptake by the tumor may be useful for the future clinical
testing of STA-12-8666 as the same polymorphisms are
retained in the patients’ tumors which may increase their
susceptibility to topoisomerase inhibition with SN-38.
Given the absence of any significant organ toxicity of STA12-8666 at the doses used in rodents, pancreatic and other
cancers arising in the carriers of Gilbert syndrome allele of
UGT1A1 [37] could be highly sensitive to STA-12-8666.
In summary, we provide preclinical evidence that
the efficacy of the existing chemotherapy agents against
pancreatic cancer can be dramatically improved by
preferential delivery via our novel HSP90 inhibitor drug
conjugate platform. Cardinal features of this innovative
system include small molecules size, high bioavailability
and prolonged retention in the tumor, as well as lack of
organ toxicity resulting in a remarkable therapeutic index
which will need to be validated in the future clinical trials
of STA-12-8666.

allele (JAX mice, 019104) were used. Both of these mouse
lines were maintained on C57BL/6 genetic background
and subsequently crossed to the C57BL/6 congenic
Trp53fl/fl conditional knockout mice (JAX mice, 008462)
to generate Pdx1-Cre;Trp53fl/fl and LSL-KrasG12D;Trp53fl/fl
breeding pairs, respectively. Their progenies develop a
spectrum of pancreatic tumors as the result of activated
oncogenic KrasG12D allele in combination with Creinduced ablation of Tp53 (KPC mice [7]). For xenograft
experiments, immunodeficient C-B17.scid mice were
purchased from the in-house colony. All animals were
maintained in our established breeding colony at FCCC.
Mice were maintained on Purina breeder chow (LabDiet,
St. Louis MN) and received water ad libitum. All animal
experiments were conducted in compliance with the FCCC
Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines and with the
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
The murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line was
obtained from a KPC mouse tumor and propagated for 6
passages by the Fox Chase Cancer Center Cell Culture
Facility. Frozen stocks of KPC cells were expanded in
RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
2 mM L-glutamine, 25 ug/ml Insulin and 100 ug/ml
penicillin/streptomycin. Patient derived xenografts (PDX)
were derived via subcutaneous implantation of surgically
obtained pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue fragments.
Frozen stocks of shredded, passage 3 PDX tissues were
used for the efficacy studies.

Antibodies and reagents
The following antibodies were used for Western
blots: phospho-H2AX (pSer139, MABE205, Millipore),
phospho-KAP1 (pS824, 70369, Abcam), Akt (2920,
Abcam), HSP70 (ADI-SPA-820-D, Enzo Life Sciences);
antibodies for phospho-Akt (pSer473, #3787), ERK1/
ERK2 (#9107), phospho-ERK1/ERK2 (pThr202/pTyr204,
#9101), β-actin (#4967), α-tubulin (#2125), EGFR
(#2646), phospho-EGFR (pTyr1173, #4407) and PARP
(#9542) were purchased from Cell Signaling. STA-128666 was supplied by Syntha Pharmaceuticals.

Cell viability assays
KPC cells were plated in 96-well plates in triplicate
at a seeding density of 900 cells/well. After 24 hr, the
cells were treated with various concentrations of the
drugs. DMSO solvent without drug served as a negative
control. After 72 hr of incubation, cells were analyzed for
viability using CellTiter Blue Assay (Life Technologies)
to determine the inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50)
values.

100 ug/ml penicillin/streptomycin. After 24 hr, the cells
were treated with CPT11 and STA 12-8666 at equimolar
concentrations (100 nM). Cell-cycle analysis was
performed 24, 48 and 72 hr after CPT11 and STA 12-8666
treatment by flow cytometry analysis of DNA content
(Guava Cell Cycle Assay). Cells fixed with 70% ethanol
overnight at -20°C were washed in PBS and resuspended
in Guava Cell Cycle Reagent for Flow Cytometry (47000160, Millipore). After 30 min at room temperature in the
dark, analysis was performed on a Guava EasyCyte flow
cytometer (Millipore) and data were analyzed using Guava
CytoSoft 5.3 software. Averaged cell-cycle profiles from
three biological repeats were plotted as histograms.

ScanScope CS scanner (Aperio) and selected images were
analyzed using the ImageScope software. For pKAP1 and
pH2AX, quantification of the percentage of stained nuclei
was done using nuclear mask algorithm. Results of the
quantification were plotted as histograms.

Xenograft experiments
Cryopreserved in DMSO PDX tumor fragments were
quickly thawed, washed in RPMI and resuspended in 1:1 mix
of RPMI and Matrigel (Corning) on ice until the moment of
implantation. Tumor fragments were subcutaneously injected
using 1 ml syringe and 18G 1½ needle in both flanks of
5-8 week old C-B17.scid mouse. Animals with established
tumors (around 150 mm3) were randomly divided to receive
STA 12-8666 at 150 mg/kg (n = 5), irinotecan at 50 mg/kg
(n = 5), or vehicle (n = 5) via retro-orbital vein injections
once a week. Tumors were measured at least two times
a week. Tumors and animal weight were measured with a
digital caliper two times per week. Tumor volumes were
calculated using the modified ellipsoid formula as described
[38] until the maximum size of 1500 mm3 or if animals
exhibited distress, >20% weight loss or if tumors ulcerated
in which case mice were humanely euthanized. In dedicated
experiments, assessment of PDX tissues was done on day 7
after the drug administration.

Western blot
Mouse and human PDX tumor tissues were lysed
with T-PER reagent (78510, Thermo Scientific) containing
double concentration of Halt™ protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (78445, Thermo Scientific). For Western blot,
KPC cells were seeded on 6-well plates at density of
30,000 cells per well in RPMI-1640 supplemented with
1% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 mg/L Insulin and 100
mg/L penicillin/streptomycin. Next day, the cells were
treated with indicated drugs for 24 hours and lysed with
RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) containing
Halt™ protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo
Scientific). Protein concentrations were measured using
BSA assay. Western blot membranes were scanned using
Odyssey infrared imaging reagents including blocking
buffer and secondary antibodies (LI-COR).

Phosphatidylserine imaging using PSVue
molecular probe
For in vitro studies, KPC cells were plated in 96well plates at a seeding density of 900 cells/well. Next
day, the cells were treated with various concentrations of
the drugs as indicated for 24 hours. PSVue-794 or control
fluorophore were applied as per the manufacturer’s
protocol (Molecular Targeting Technologies) and analyzed
on Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). For
PSVue-794 in vivo imaging experiments, 6 week old
KPC mice were treated with STA-12-8666 at 150 mg/kg
or irinotecan at 50 mg/kg. On day 7, mice were injected
via retro-orbital vein with 150 µl of 1mM PSVue-794,
fluorescence and white light images were acquired using
IVIS Spectrum imager (PerkinElmer, Hopkinton MA),
with excitation = 750nm, emission = 800nm, binning = 1,
FOV setting = C, lamp level = high, and exposure times of
5-15 sec, depending on the signal strength. Infrared signal
in the tumor was quantified relative to the fluorescence
signal in the liver from the same animal. The control
animals received the same dose of untargeted PSVue
control probe which showed only faint background signal.

Treatment of KPC mice
In the KPC survival experiment, mice were
prospectively enrolled into drug treatment cohorts at the
age of 5 weeks. Saline vehicle (n=9) or STA-12-8666 (n
= 6, 150 mg/kg) were given as retro-orbital vein injections
weekly for 5 weeks. Mice were sacrificed if moribund, in
distress or >20% weight loss. Survival curves were plotted
and median survival time for both cohorts was calculated. In
dedicated tissue studies, 6 week old KPC mice were treated
with single doses of STA-12-8666 (150 mg/kg), irinotecan
(50 mg/kg) or saline vehicle via retro-orbital vein injection.
On day 7, tumor and organ tissues were evenly divided in 3
parts to obtain lysates, fixed in formalin or frozen.

Histology
Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissues
were cut in serial 5 micron sections and H&E stained.
Pancreata with identifiable pancreatic adenocarcinoma
and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm (PanIN)
lesions and organ tissues were further stained using
immunoperoxidase ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and
indicated antibodies. Stained slides were scanned using
