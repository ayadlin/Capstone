Temozolomide, an orally administered alkylating agent, is used to treat malignant gliomas. Recent reports also have
documented its efficacy in the treatment of pituitary adenomas and carcinomas. Temozolomide methylates DNA and
thereby exhibits an antitumor effect. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a DNA repair enzyme,
removes alkylating adducts induced by temozolomide, counteracting its effects. The authors of this review conducted
a Medline database search regarding temozolomide in the treatment of pituitary tumors. Demographic characteristics, tumor types, and therapeutic responses were noted in all patients. Data regarding MGMT immunoexpression,
which was documented in some studies, were correlated with information regarding clinical and radiologic responses.
To date, there have been 19 reported cases of adenohypophyseal tumors treated with temozolomide, including 13
adenomas and 6 carcinomas. Ten of those 13 adenomas responded favorably, and 2 nonresponsive tumors had highlevel MGMT immunoexpression. All 6 carcinomas responded to therapy, but data regarding MGMT expression were
available for only 3 patients, and each had low MGMT expression. In 2 adenomas, morphologic studies were performed both before and after the patients received temozolomide. The responsive tumor had necrosis, hemorrhage,
fibrosis, and neuronal differentiation. The nonresponsive tumor had no changes. There have been no reported complications attributable to temozolomide. The current results indicated that temozolomide is efficacious in the treatment
of aggressive pituitary adenomas and pituitary carcinomas. Evidence indicated that low-level MGMT immunoexpression is correlated with a favorable response. A significant proportion of pituitary adenomas and carcinomas had low

Clinically, aggressive pituitary adenomas are difficult to manage. A significant number of patients with these adeno-

mas have invasion of bone, dura, and/or adjacent structures, thus complicating or precluding their resection.1 Patients
with aggressive pituitary adenomas present with problems caused largely by incomplete resection, recurrence, and associated morbidity.2 Repeated surgeries, pharmacologic treatments, and radiotherapy are used, but many patients experience
tumor regrowth.3,4 Functional adenomas, particularly prolactin (PRL)-producing and growth hormone (GH)-producing
tumors, may become resistant to medical therapy, thereby necessitating multiple surgical procedures. Radiotherapy and
even conventional chemotherapy are used in an attempt to control tumor growth, but the results often are disappointing.5
Pituitary carcinomas are rare. Their large size, invasiveness, and craniospinal or systemic metastases represent particular diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.6-9 Progression of disease after a diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma is variable but
often inexorable. Multiple treatment approaches, including surgery, external-beam radiotherapy, radiosurgery, adjuvant

pharmacologic treatment, and various chemotherapeutic
regimens, generally are palliative at best and achieve only
temporary local control.8 Fully 75% of patients with systemic metastasis and 66% of all patients die of disease
within 1 year of presenting with disease spread.9 Recent
publications have reported the use of temozolomide in the
treatment of aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas2,10-25 (unpublished results). These form the basis of
our review.

epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, largely because
of hypermethylation of its promoter.39-41 Low-level
MGMT expression results in the accumulation of guanine-to-adenosine transition mutations and also furthers
genomic instability.42,43 However, it is a predictive
marker of a favorable outcome in patients with temozolomide-treated glioblastomas.44-47 Temozolomide also
reportedly enhances radiation responsiveness in MGMTnegative human glioblastoma cell lines.48

Temozolomide
Temozolomide is a second-generation alkylating chemotherapeutic agent that is related to a series of imidazotetrazines that were synthesized in 1987.26,27 Orally
administered, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. At
physiologic pH, it undergoes rapid chemical conversion
to methyl-triazeno-imidazole-carboxamide, the active
drug.28 This exerts its cytotoxic effect through methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at the O6 position
of guanine,29 which then mispairs with thymine during
the next cycle of DNA replication. The sequence of mismatch-repair events initiated leads to apoptosis. One
advantage of temozolomide is that it is not cell cycle-specific; thus, it inhibits all phases of tumor cell growth. Consequently, the agent is ideal for the treatment of relatively
slow-growing pituitary tumors.17
Temozolomide is accepted as an essential component of adjuvant therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma
multiforme and other tumors of the central nervous system.30-32 Recent reports indicate its efficacy in advancedstage, malignant neuroendocrine neoplasia33,34 and in
melanoma.35
The standard therapeutic dose of temozolomide is
150 to 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 of every 28 days. Temozolomide absorption is minimally affected by food. The most
common nonhematologic adverse effects include nausea,
vomiting, fatigue, headache, and constipation. Generally,
these are mild to moderate in severity. Hematologic toxicities (ie, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) are observed
but occur in <10% of patients.30
MGMT is a DNA repair protein that reverses alkylation at the O6 position of guanine by transferring the
alkyl group to a sulfur group of cysteine within its
sequence.36 It plays the role of removing alkylating
adducts induced by temozolomide treatment, thereby
counteracting its antineoplastic action.37,38 It appears that
high tumor expression of MGMT confers resistance to
temozolomide. It is widely believed that low-level expression in a wide spectrum of human tumors results from

Pituitary Carcinomas
Pituitary carcinomas are difficult to manage because of
their relentless growth and metastatic spread despite multimodality therapy. The latter treatments include repeat
surgery, pharmacologic manipulation, radiotherapy, and
chemotherapy.49,50 Various combinations, such as cisplatinum, etoposide, and/or paclitaxel, have not achieved
sustained responses.8
Fadul et al12,13 first reported the successful use of
temozolomide in pituitary carcinomas in 2004. Their 2
patients, 1 patient who had systemic metastases of a luteinizing hormone (LH)-producing (gonadotropic) pituitary
carcinoma and 1 patient who had a prolactin (PRL)-producing (lactotrophic) carcinoma with spinal dissemination, were treated, and both achieved a sustained
response. Thereafter, Zhu et al25 and Lim et al17 administered temozolomide to a patient who had a PRL-producing pituitary carcinoma. In these first 3 patients,
persistent, significant clinical and biochemical improvement as well as substantial radiographic tumor shrinkage
were noted.
To date, 6 patients with pituitary carcinomas have
received treatment with temozolomide10,12-14,17,19,23-25
(Table 1). These included 4 men and 2 women ages 26 to
77 years (mean, 49.8 years). The time between disease
presentation and temozolomide administration was 7 to
23 years (mean, 11.8 years). The group included 4 PRLproducing carcinomas, 1 LH-producing carcinoma, and 1
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing carcinoma of the Crooke cell type in the setting of Nelson syndrome. All patients exhibited clinical and radiologic
responses to temozolomide. Assessment of MGMT
immunoexpression was performed in only 3 patients, and
all 3 had low expression levels.

undergone 5 previous surgeries. He had received not only
radiotherapy but also bromocriptine, pergolide, and
cabergoline treatment, and none of those treatments had
any effect on the growth of his tumor. When temozolomide treatment was administered, the PRL levels
decreased immediately. After 8 cycles of treatment, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan disclosed tumor
hemorrhage and necrosis. The patient underwent an additional surgery at which the tumor was resected easily given
its friable and soft consistency. Histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural investigations revealed significant differences from the previously resected tumor
that was not treated with temozolomide.
Neff et al21 reported a patient who had an invasive
prolactinoma that was resistant to dopamine agonists but
was quite responsive to temozolomide treatment. The
PRL level dropped over the course of treatment, and an
MRI scan revealed marked tumor shrinkage, precluding
yet another surgery. Tumor size and PRL level in that
patient continued to be stable after 26 months of
treatment.
Kovacs et al16 reported a patient aged 41 years who
had an aggressive, silent, subtype 2 corticotrophic adenoma with no morphologic changes after temozolomide
treatment. MGMT immunoexpression was positive.
Based on these results, those authors suggested that
MGMT immunoexpression may predict responsiveness
to temozolomide therapy.
Fully 10 more patients with pituitary adenomas have
received treatment with temozolomide2,10,11,14,19,20,22
(unpublished results), bringing the current total to 13
patients, including 9 men and 4 women ages 20 to 61 years
(mean, 47.9 years) (Table 2). Aside from 1 incidentally discovered tumor in a patient with concomitant glioblastoma
multiforme, all tumors have been studied morphologically.
The group includes 4 PRL-producing tumors (30%), 3
ACTH-producing tumors (23%), 2 nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, 1 silent subtype 2 adenoma, 1 GH-producing adenoma, 1 gonadotroph adenoma with oncocytic
features, and 1 null cell adenoma of the oncocytic type. The
time elapsed from the clinical onset of disease to the beginning of temozolomide treatment ranged from 2 years to 23
years (mean, 11.8 years). Eleven of the 13 tumors (87%)
had been irradiated previously, except for the incidentally
discovered tumor. The latter tumor lay outside the radiation treatment field. All other patients underwent at least 1
surgery (range, 1-7 surgeries; mean, 3 surgeries).
MGMT immunoexpression was documented in 11
of the 13 patients and was high in 2 patients, intermediate

in 4 patients, and low in 5 patients. The 2 patients with
high MGMT expression had no response to temozolomide (1 patient with a silent corticotrophic adenoma subtype 2 and 1 patient with a GH-producing adenoma).
One of the tumors with intermediate MGMT expression
recurred when temozolomide therapy was stopped;
whereas, in 5 patients who had low MGMT immunoexpression, the response was favorable.
Morphologic Changes
Syro et al23 and Kovacs et al15,16 published the only morphologic comparisons of pathology before and after temozolomide treatment. In those studies, operative findings
included tumor softening and friability, both of which
facilitated resection at reintervention. The temozolomidetreated tumor had better differentiation and consisted of
larger cells, exhibited fewer mitoses, and had a lower Ki67 labeling index. Tumor hemorrhage, necrosis, focal fibrosis, and neuronal transformation also were observed,30
and MGMT immunoexpression was lacking entirely.
Post-treatment, the PRL-producing adenoma exhibited necrosis, edema, hemorrhage, accumulation of connective tissue, inflammatory infiltrates, larger/more
differentiated tumor cells, and neuronal transformation.
The Ki-67 labeling index had decreased (from 40%-60%
pretreatment to 5% thereafter). There also was a corresponding reduction in mitotic activity (from 11 of 1000
nuclei to 2 of 1000 nuclei).15 Predictably, in the MGMTpositive, silent, subtype 2 corticotrophic adenoma, no
such alterations were produced.16
Radiographic Changes
Three patterns of radiographic change have been observed
on MRI images from patients who had a good response to
temozolomide treatment. These included tumor necrosis
and hemorrhage,15,23 tumor degenerative and cystic
changes,22 and tumor shrinkage.2,10,11,14,19-21,24 These
changes could be observed as early as 2 months after the
onset of temozolomide treatment.
Clinical Response
In all reported temozolomide-responsive tumors, the clinical response has been rapid and has been associated with
decreased chiasmatic compression and mass effects. In the
patients with functional (PRL-producing and ACTHproducing) tumors, an almost immediate reduction in
plasma hormone values became apparent after the commencement of therapy (Tables 1 and 2).

458

MGMT Immunoexpression
Kovacs et al were the first to report the inverse relation
between MGMT immunoexpression and temozolomide
response in 2 patients with aggressive adenomas.16 Their
observations were confirmed subsequently by McCormack et al, who assessed MGMT reactivity in a PRL cell
carcinoma and an aggressive growth hormone-producing
adenoma.19 In both studies, tumors with low MGMT
expression demonstrated a clinical and radiologic
response to temozolomide therapy, whereas tumors with
high MGMT expression were resistant. Two additional
case reports of invasive, ACTH-producing adenomas with
low-level MGMT expression also demonstrated the corresponding efficacy of temozolomide therapy.2,20 Thus,
determining the level of MGMT immunostaining appears
to be useful for predicting the response of aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas to temozolomide.2
The reports of Kovacs et al16 and McCormack
19
et al underscored the inverse relation between MGMT
immunoexpression and the efficacy of temozolomide
therapy, a relation that also has been noted in high-grade
gliomas.51,52 Whereas the standard method of evaluating
MGMT status is the identification of promoter methylation, the detection of MGMT expression by immunohistochemistry presents an attractive alternative. It represents
inexpensive, readily accessible technology that is available
to most laboratories.53 Most available data pertaining to
gliomas and temozolomide therapy are based on an analysis
of the methylation status of the MGMT promoter, whereas
data pertaining to pituitary neoplasms are based simply on
immunohistochemistry for MGMT expression.
To date, MGMT immunoexpression has been
documented in 3 carcinomas and 11 adenomas (Table 3).
In 8 tumors, including 3 carcinomas and 5 adenomas,
MGMT expression was low and was correlated with a
good therapeutic response to temozolomide. In 4 adenomas, MGMT staining was intermediate; 3 of those
patients responded well, and the other patient had tumor
progression when treatment was discontinued. High
MGMT immunoexpression in 2 adenomas was not associated with a therapeutic response. Thus, patients who
had tumors that featured low and intermediate MGMT
immunoexpression (n¼12), compared with those who
had tumors with high MGMT immunoexpression (n¼2),
had a good response to temozolomide treatment (11 of 12
patients [91.6%] vs 0 of 2 patients [0%]; P ¼ .03; 2-tailed
Fisher exact test).
PRL-producing and ACTH-producing tumors
most frequently had low MGMT expression (Table 3).

McCormack et al also observed that prolactinomas
accounted for >60% of tumors with low-level MGMT
expression.19 Of the reported cases, 4 of 11 pituitary
adenomas11,14-16,23 and 4 of 6 pituitary carcinomas10,13,14,25 that were responsive to temozolomide were
the PRL-producing type (Tables 1 and 2), in keeping with
the finding by McCormack et al that prolactinomas had a
propensity for low-level MGMT expression compared
with other tumors.19 Also noteworthy is the study by
Takeshita et al24 of 7 invasive Crooke cell adenomas, a
morphologic variant of corticotrophic adenomas; of these,
5 had low MGMT expression compared with 1 of 17 conventional ACTH-producing adenomas.
Two studies focused on MGMT immunoexpression
in both primary and recurrent tumors.19,53 McCormack
et al19 observed no significant differences between recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors. Widhalm et al53 assessed
MGMT immunohistochemistry in 45 nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, including 24 progressive/recurrent
tumors and 21 control specimens from patients who were
tumor free postoperatively, and reported that 12 of 24
progressive/recurrent tumors (50%) had low MGMT
expression compared with 5 of 21 tumors in the control
group (24%). A greater proportion of recurrent tumors in
that study had <10% MGMT immunoreactivity, and a
25% reduction in MGMT expression was observed
between the first and last surgeries. Although these differences were not statistically significant, they suggest that
half of patients who have recurring, nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas are potential candidates for temozolomide
treatment.

Reduced MGMT immunoexpression in recurrent
tumors may correlate with a change in its behavior. During
tumorigenesis, loss of MGMT expression and impaired
capability of DNA repair have been observed.37,38,41 In
contrast, MGMT overexpression has prevented carcinogenesis in mouse models.37 In low-grade astrocytomas, lack of
MGMT expression has been considered a marker of malignant transformation.54 The issue of promoter methylation
of the MGMT gene is important for diminished MGMT
function. It has been demonstrated that, in pituitary
tumors, promoter methylation is a frequent event.55,56
Bello et al57 reported that MGMT was methylated at significant rates in both functional and nonfunctional adenomas.
This epigenetic alteration may disrupt the key cellular functions of MGMT and contribute to pituitary adenoma development. In this vein, a change in MGMT expression in
recurring tumors could affect adenoma progression, recurrence, and aggressive behavior.
Suggested Indications for
Temozolomide Treatment
On the basis of published cases, suggested and possible
indications for treating patients with temozolomide
include the following:

1. Patients with aggressive, PRL-producing tumors
that are resistant to bromocriptine or cabergoline
and undergo continued growth after surgery and
radiotherapy;
2. Aggressive, ACTH-producing tumors, especially
the Crooke cell and Nelson syndrome variants,
that are not cured by surgery and radiotherapy;

459

Review Article

3. Recurrent, nonfunctional tumors that exhibit
continued growth after repeated surgeries and
radiotherapy;
4. Recurrent, regrowing tumors that have undergone
repeat surgeries and radiotherapy with unsuccessful resection because of hard, fibrous consistency
of the tumor (in such tumors, temozolomide
could serve to soften the lesion before another
attempt at resection); and
5. Pituitary carcinomas.
Future Directions
In recurrent, aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas that are resistant to multimodality therapy, radiotherapy, pharmacologic manipulation, and multiple
conventional chemotherapy, the assessment of MGMT
immunoexpression may serve as a predictor of response to
temozolomide. If MGMT expression is low, then a dramatic response can be anticipated. If MGMT expression
is high, then therapeutic alternatives can be used in an
effort to improve outcome.
For example, depletion of MGMT has been proposed as a means of improving tumor response to temozolomide. Experimental and clinical data have
demonstrated that temozolomide response is schedule-dependent and that alternative dosing regimens may
enhance its efficacy.58,59 Temozolomide can be administered on a continuous, daily, metronomic schedule as
well, thus producing more MGMT depletion and
improving response to treatment: The dose is 50 mg/m2
daily without interruption.
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that pseudosubstrates of MGMT, such as O6-benzylguanine or lomeguatrib (O6-[4-bromothenyl]guanine), can deplete
MGMT levels in tumors with high MGMT expression,
thus enhancing the therapeutic effect of alkylating
agents.60,61 At therapeutic levels, O6-benzylguanine renders the tumor cells more sensitive to the alkylating agent
and establishes its potential therapeutic effect as an
enhancer of drug effect. In gliomas, it has been used with
negative results.62
Conclusion
Temozolomide has demonstrated value in the treatment
of aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas. The
clinical and radiologic responses are encouraging. Clearly,
there is an inverse correlation between MGMT immunoexpression and therapeutic response to temozolomide.

460

In our literature review, a significant proportion of pituitary neoplasms that were responsive to temozolomide featured low MGMT immunoexpression, whereas the only 2
nonresponders had tumors with high-level MGMT
expression. Immunohistochemistry for MGMT appears
to be a promising method for guiding therapeutic decision-making and predicting the therapeutic response to
temozolomide.19,53 The molecular mechanisms that
affect MGMT expression remain to be fully elucidated.
Targeted modulation of MGMT may be useful in
patients who otherwise may not respond to temozolomide
therapy. Future therapies that change dosing regimens or
that use pseudosubstrates may improve tumor responsiveness to temozolomide.
