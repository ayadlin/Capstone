ABSTRACT:
The Ras family of small GTPases transmits extracellular signals that regulate
cell growth, differentiation, motility and death. Ras signaling is constitutively active
in a large number of human cancers. Ras can also regulate autophagy by affecting
several signaling pathways including the mTOR pathway. Autophagy is a process
that regulates the balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation. It is
important for normal growth control, but may be defective in diseases. Previously,
we have shown that Ras inhibition by FTS induces autophagy, which partially protects
cancer cells and may limit the use of FTS as an anti-cancer drug. Since FTS is a non
toxic drug we hypothesized that FTS and chloroquine (an autophagy inhibitor) will
synergize in cell growth inhibition and cell death. Thus, in the present study, we
explored the mechanism of each individual drug and their combined action. Our results
demonstrate that in HCT-116 and in Panc-1 cells, FTS induces autophagy, which can
be inhibited by chloroquine. Furthermore, the combined treatment synergistically
decreased the number of viable cells. Interestingly, the combined treatment enhanced
apoptotic cell death as indicated by increased sub-G1 cell population, increased
Hoechst staining, activation of caspase 3, decrease in survivin expression and release
of cytochrome c. Thus, chloroquine treatment may promote FTS-mediated inhibition
of tumor cell growth and may stimulate apoptotic cell death.

INTRODUCTION

membrane. A synthetic Ras inhibitor, S-trans, transfarnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; also known as Salirasib),
which structurally resembles the carboxy-terminal
farnesylcysteine group common to all Ras proteins, was
developed [7]. FTS acts as a functional Ras antagonist in
cells, affecting Ras-membrane interactions by dislodging
the protein from its anchorage domains, facilitating its
degradation and, thus, reducing cellular active Ras content
[8, 9]. FTS has been shown to inhibit the growth of H-Ras,
K-Ras and N-Ras transformed rodent fibroblasts in vitro
and to inhibit the anchorage-independent growth of several
cancer cell lines [10-13].
Autophagy, a process of self-digestion of cellular
constituents, regulates the balance between protein
synthesis and protein degradation [14, 15]. Autophagy is
important for normal growth, and might be defective in
disease [16, 17]. It permits the elimination of damaged
organelles in the cell, and allows recycling of free amino

The Ras family of small GTPases transmits signals
initiated by cell surface receptors, to regulate several
cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation,
motility and death [1]. Activated Ras transmits signals
through its interaction with multiple effectors, including
mitogen activated kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K) and Ral-GEF [1, 2]. Ras signaling is
constitutively activated in a large fraction of human
cancers [3]. Activating mutations of the three major Ras
isoforms (H, K and N) were found in more than 33% of all
human cancers [4-6].
Ras signaling is a major junction of various
signaling pathways. For this reason, Ras and its effectors
serve as important targets for therapeutic intervention. In
order for Ras to be functional, it is modified by an addition
of a farnesyl lipid group that allows its attachment to the

acids and nutrients in the case of nutrient deprivation or
other insults. For this reason, it plays a crucial role as a
cell-survival mechanism under stress conditions, such as
absence of nutrients and is essential for normal cell growth
and survival [18].
The formation of autophagosomes, autophagic
vesicles, is controlled by several Atg proteins [17].
Atg8 proteins, also known as MAP-LC3 (in human), are
associated with the autophagosomal membrane, and can
serve as a marker for autophagy [14]. Additional protein
which serves as an autophagy marker is the p62/SQSTM1,
a scaffold protein that binds LC3 and ubiquitinated protein
aggregates, and is degraded during autophagy [19].
Involvement of autophagy was documented in
some forms of cancer, including hepatoma, pancreatic
and breast carcinomas [17]. Chloroquine is a known
drug, commonly used to prevent malaria [20]. It was
demonstrated that chloroquine could inhibit autophagy
by blocking lysosomal acidification and, consequently,
autophagosome degradation [21]. Since chloroquine
inhibits autophagosome degradation, it is expected
that LC3-II levels will increase following chloroquine
treatment, due to the lack of LC3 degradation.
Recent studies suggest inhibition of autophagy as
a new strategy for cancer therapy [21, 22]. These studies
have demonstrated that some cancers depend on autophagy
for survival during external stresses, such as hypoxia,
chemotherapy or radiotherapy [23]. Other studies suggest
a possible involvement of Ras and autophagy in cancer cell
transformation [24, 25] and addiction [26]. In the present
study we examined the impact chloroquine and FTS
treatments have on cell viability of two cancer cell lines
which express mutant K-Ras (Panc-1 and HCT-116). In
agreement with our previous report [27], we demonstrate
that FTS alone induces autophagy and cell growth
inhibition in these two cell lines. However, following the
combined treatment, inhibition of FTS-induced autophagy
by chloroquine, synergistically promoted cell growth
inhibition, inhibited anchorage independent growth and
enhanced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. These
results demonstrate a mechanism by which the combined
treatment of FTS and chloroquine induces cell death.
Thus, the combined treatment may have a better anticancer effect than each drug alone.

autophagy in Panc-1 (human pancreatic cancer) and HCT116 (human colon cancer) cell lines, both expressing
mutant constitutively active K-Ras [28, 29]. In order
to determine autophagy, LC3-II and p62 proteins were
used as autophagy markers. Cells were treated with
the indicated FTS concentrations for the indicated time
periods. As shown in Figure S1A and B, the levels of
LC3-II increased in a dose-dependent manner, indicating
that FTS has induced autophagy in these two cell lines.
Interestingly, the levels of p62 decreased only at a short
time (18 h) following treatment. At longer incubation
periods, p62 levels significantly increased. These results
suggest that p62, which is needed for continuation of the
autophagic process, may be synthesized de-novo at later
stages of autophagy. Therefore, we examined whether
the increase in p62 levels is due to a de-novo synthesis of
the protein. Cells were treated with FTS in the presence
or in the absence of cycloheximide (a protein synthesis
inhibitor) and the levels of p62 were determined. As shown
in Figure S1C, in the presence of cycloheximide, FTS
had no effect on p62 levels, indicating that the increase
in p62 is caused by protein synthesis. These results also
suggest that the increased levels of p62 are secondary to
the decrease observed shortly following FTS treatment.
Interestingly, cycloheximide also causes a decrease in
LC3 levels, indicating that synthesis of LC3 proteins also
occurs.
Having demonstrated that FTS induced autophagy
in these cell lines, we next examined the effect of
chloroquine on LC3-II levels. Chloroquine inhibits
autophagosome fusion with the lysosome, thus causing
an increase in the levels of LC3-II [21]. Cells were
incubated with the indicated FTS concentrations in the
absence or in the presence of chloroquine. As shown in
Figure 1A, chloroquine treatment, which blocks lysosomal
acidification, dramatically increased the levels of LC3-II.
Treatment with FTS alone has also increased LC3-II levels
due to the enhancement of autophagy induction (Figure
1) and autophagic flux [27]. The combined treatment
significantly enhanced LC3-II levels compared to each
treatment alone. To further examine the effect of FTS
and chloroquine treatment on autophagy, we have used
Panc-1 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 and followed
the generation of LC3 puncta following treatments. As
a positive control, EBSS treatment was used (Figure
1B). As shown, FTS treatment increased GFP-LC3puncta. Likewise, chloroquine treatment significantly
enhanced the generation of GFP-LC3 puncta. However,
the combined treatment with FTS and chloroquine further
enhanced autophagosomes accumulation, as judged by the
increase in punctate staining. Taken together, the results
indicate that chloroquine enhances FTS-induced LC3-II
accumulation.
Next, we examined whether FTS treatment, with
or without chloroquine, affects cell viability. Panc-1 and
HCT-116 cells were treated with or without FTS (60 or

RESULTS
Recently, we have found that Ras inhibition by FTS
can induce autophagy, which partially protects cells from
FTS treatment [27]. However, the mechanism by which
FTS-induced autophagy protects cells and the impact of
a combined treatment with chloroquine (an autophagy
inhibitor) and FTS were unknown. In the present study, we
examined whether inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine
will potentiate the effect of FTS on cell growth inhibition
and cell death. First, we examined whether FTS induces

50 µM respectively), in the absence or in the presence
of chloroquine (4 µM), for the indicated time periods.
Cell viability was determined using the methylene blue
staining assay. As demonstrated in Figure 2A and B, FTS
treatment significantly inhibited cell growth. However,
the effect of FTS was significantly more pronounced in
the presence of chloroquine. These results suggest that
although FTS inhibits cell growth, the autophagy induced
by the drug may partially protect cells, whereas inhibition
of autophagy by chloroquine may increase cells sensitivity

to FTS. In order to examine the contribution of active Ras
to the effect of the combined treatment on cell viability,
we have used Rat-1 fibroblasts and Rat-1 transfected
with H-Ras (12V), known as EJ cells. As shown in
Figure 2C, Ras transformed, EJ cells responded to FTS
and chloroquine treatments by cell growth inhibition. In
contrast, Rat-1 cells grown under the same conditions
were not affected. Thus, cells expressing activated Ras
are more sensitive to the treatment.
To further characterize the nature of the combined

FTS and chloroquine treatment (additive or synergistic)
cell viability following the combined treatment at various
drugs concentrations in a fixed ratio was determined
(Figure 3). The data were used to calculate ‘CI’ plots
to assess whether drug combination is synergistic or
additive [30]. As shown, the combined treatment exhibited
synergistic effect over a wide range of low concentrations
in both cell lines tested (CI<1). Nonetheless, at high drugs
concentrations the combined treatment was additive
(CI=1).
Next, we examined whether the combined treatment
with FTS and chloroquine affects anchorage-independent

growth. For this aim, we employed the soft agar assay.
Cells were plated in soft agar and maintained in culture
for 11-13 days, as indicated, before quantifying the
number and size of colonies able to grow in an anchorageindependent manner. Results of typical experiments are
shown in Figure 4. Under these conditions, the combined
treatment induced a significantly lower number of colonies
compared to each of the drugs alone, in both cell lines
tested. Thus, the combined treatment appears to inhibit
cell transformation.
Next, the combined treatment was tested for the
induction of cell death. Two methods for detection of cell

death were implimented: flow cytometry and Hoecsht dye
exclusion assay. The results presented in Figure 5 and
Figure 6 demonstrate that chloroquine enhances FTSinduced cell death in both cell lines, as evident by the
increase in sub-G1 population (Figure 5) and by the high
percentage of Hoecsht-positive cells (Figure 6). Hence,
our findings clearly demonstrate that in these cells FTS
induces autophagy, which partially protects cells from
FTS-induced cell death and cell growth inhibition, while
autophagy inhibition by chloroquine promotes FTSmediated cell death.
To further characterize the mechanism of cell death
induced by the combined treatment, we have used two

typical apoptosis markers: caspase 3 cleavage and survivin
levels. As shown in Figure 7A, the combined treatment
significantly enhanced caspase 3 cleavage and reduced
survivin levels. We then used the broad spectrum caspase
inhibitor QVD-OPH, which reduced the cell growth
inhibition induced by the combined treatment of FTS and
chloroquine (Figure 7B). Additional apoptotic parameter,
which indicates changes in mitochondrial outer membrane
permeability (MOMP), was implemented. During early
stages of apoptosis, cytochrome c is often released from
the mitochondria. We wanted to examine whether this
phenomenon occurred in cells treated with FTS and
chloroquine. The cellular distribution of cytochrome c in

the treated cells was examined by immunofluorescence
staining with anti-cytochrome c antibodies. As shown
in Figure 8, healthy control cells exhibited a scattered,
punctuated cytochrome c staining pattern, typical of the
subcellular distribution of mitochondria, whereas the cells
co-treated with FTS and chloroquine exhibited a diffuse
cytochrome c staining pattern, suggestive of release of
cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Consequently, it
appears that the combined treatment of chloroquine and
FTS induces caspase dependent apoptotic cell death in
HCT-116 and Panc-1 cells.

might be a part of a pro-death mechanism. In particular,
that H-Ras-induced autophagy contributes to caspaseindependent cell death [33]. Ras was also found to
upregulate beclin 1 and a knockdown of the key autophagy
genes BECN1, ATG5 or ATG7 was shown to reduce
oncogenic Ras-mediated cell death [33, 34]. On the other
hand, several studies showed that active Ras could inhibit
autophagy [35, 36]. Recently, we have demonstrated
that FTS (a Ras inhibitor) promotes autophagy in treated
cells [27]. In the present study we demonstrate that FTS
induces autophagy also in Panc-1 and HCT-116 cancer cell
lines, both expressing mutant constitutively active K-Ras.
Therefore, inhibition of Ras by FTS promotes autophagy
in several cancer cells.
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process,
which functions as a tumor suppression mechanism by
removing damaged organelles/proteins and limiting
cell growth and genomic instability [37]. Most studies
demonstrate that autophagy plays a role in cell survival.

DISCUSSION
Ras signaling is a major junction of various
signaling pathways, which control cell viability. Several
studies have shown that oncogenic Ras can elevate the
pro-survival activity of autophagy [22, 31, 32]. However,
other studies had demonstrated that Ras-driven autophagy

bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258, 1 µg/ml) to assess the number of dying cells. Following staining, the cells were photographed using Olympus

of Hoechst-positive cells compared to the number of total cells in each field (7-10 fields for each treatment, 100-200 cells per field). Results

However, cell death, resulting from uncontrolled
excessive autophagy, was also documented [38, 39].
Evidence also exist that autophagy has a role not only
in tumor suppression, but also as a process involved in
oncogenesis [25]. Several studies implicated a complex
interplay between autophagy and cancer. Previously,
we have demonstrated that autophagy induced by FTS
partially protects cells from death [27]. These results
motivated us to further study the effect of FTS treatment
in combination with autophagy inhibitor on cancer cells
viability. Since chloroquine has been safely used for
many years to treat malaria, it was chosen for the present
study as an autophagy inhibitor [20]. It was also shown
to have favorable effects as a novel antitumor drug in
several studies [22, 40, 41]. Indeed, our results indicate
that inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine resulted in
enhanced cell growth inhibition and even enhanced cell

death in response to FTS treatment. The inhibitory effect
of the combined treatment was synergistic, suggesting
that each of the inhibitors may affect a distinct pathway.
Furthermore, we also found that H-Ras-transformed cells
were more sensitive to the combined treatment compared
to naïve cells, which means that Ras-transformed cells
respond better to the treatment. Moreover, the combined
treatment seems to inhibit anchorage independent growth
of cancer cells. It also appears that the combined treatment
enhances caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death as
judged by typical apoptotic assays. Accordingly, we
suggest that in addition to the ability of FTS to inhibit cell
growth, it also induces pro-survival autophagy and prodeath pathways. Inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine
strengthens the cell death pathways induced by FTS. In
fact, our study suggests that the combined inhibition of
Ras by FTS and autophagy by chloroquine has a greater

Cell lines

Cell cycle analysis

The human cancer cell lines Panc-1 and HCT116 were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA)
and McCoy’s 5A modified medium (Sigma-Aldrich),
respectively. Rat-1 fibroblast cells and H-Ras-transformed
Rat-1 cells (EJ cells) were grown in DMEM. All media
were supplemented with antibiotics and 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells were incubated at 37°C
in 5% CO2 in air, and the medium was changed every 3‒4
days. When 70% confluent, cells were passaged in trypsin/
disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Biological
Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel). One day before treatment
the cells were plated at ~50% confluence in medium
supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(10% for EJ and Rat-1 cells). Concentrations for FTS
treatments (and control treatments with 0.1% DMSO) are
indicated for each experiment, as well as the duration of
treatment, when relevant.

Cells were plated in medium supplemented with 5%
FBS and treated as indicated. After treatment, the cells
were trypsinized, washed once with PBS, and fixed in
cold methanol for 15 minutes. Fixed cells were washed
once with PBS and incubated at 4ºC for 30 minutes.
RNase A (0.05 mg/ml) and propidium iodide (0.05 mg/
ml) were added and the stained cells were analyzed in
a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScan; Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) within 30 minutes.
Percentage of cells at different stages of the cell cycle was
determined using the WinMDI 2.9 program.

Lysate preparation and Western Blot analyses
After the indicated treatment, cells were lysed
in solubilization buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150
mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM
EDTA pH 8, 1 mM EGTA pH 8, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200
µM Na3VO4, 150 nM aprotinin, 1 µM leupeptin and
500 µM 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride
hydrochloride). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation,
and a boiling gel sample buffer was added. Lysates were
resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis through 10%-12.5% polyacrylamide gels,
and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in TBST
buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1%
Tween 20) containing 6% milk, and then blotted with
primary antibodies for 2 hours. Secondary antibody, linked
to horseradish peroxidase, was then added for 1 hour.
Immunoreactive bands were detected with the enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent. Densitometric analysis of the
results was performed using the ImageJ program.

Stable transfection
Panc-1 cells were stably transfected with the
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable clones
expressing LC3-GFP were selected and cultured with 400
µg/ml geneticin (G-418, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA).

Assays of cell survival and cell death
Cells were plated in medium supplemented with 5%
FBS and treated as indicated for the different experiments.
Cell numbers were determined by the methylene blue
assay. For this purpose, the cells were fixed with 4%
formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 hours,
then washed once with 0.1 M boric acid (pH 8.5) and
incubated with the DNA-binding dye methylene blue (1%
in boric acid) for 20 minutes at room temperature. The
cells were then washed three times with distilled water and
lysed with 0.1 M HCl. Absorbance was measured with a
Tecan Spectrafluor Plus spectrophotometer (Mannedorf,
Switzerland) at 595 nm. Cell viability was calculated
as the ratio of absorbance in treated cultures to that in
untreated control cultures.
To estimate the number of dead cells, live cultures
were incubated for 10 minutes with 1 μg/ml of the
fluorescent DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258;
Sigma). After staining, the cells were photographed with
an Olympus motorized inverted research microscope

and mixed with medium (concentrated ×2 with 20% FCS),
and the mixture (50 µl) was placed in 96-well plates to
provide the base agar (at a final concentration of 1%). The
cells were suspended in medium (concentrated ×2 with

were added to the wells. The plates were incubated for the
10-14 days at 37ºC. Colonies were then stained with 25

Chou and Talalay (1984). First, we constructed the dose–
response curves for the cytotoxic effects of FTS and
chloroquine alone, and in combination, in Panc-1 and
HCT-116 cells using the methylene blue staining assay.
The data was used to determine the ‘combination index’
(CI), using the equation: CI = (D)1/(Dx)1+(D)2/(Dx)2,
where (D)1 and (D)2 are the combinations doses that kill
x% of cells, and (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 are the doses of each
drug alone that kill x% of cells. If CI<1, then synergism
is indicated.
