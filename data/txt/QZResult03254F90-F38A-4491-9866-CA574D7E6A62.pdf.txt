ABSTRACT
To successfully target Notch receptors as part of a multidrug anticancer strategy,
it will be essential to fully characterize the factors that are modulated by Notch
signaling. We recently reported that Notch3 silencing in HCC results in p53 upregulation in vitro and, therefore, we focused on the mechanisms that associate
Notch3 to p53 protein expression. We explored the regulation of p53 by Notch3
signalling in three HCC cell lines HepG2, SNU398 and Hep3B.We found that Notch3
regulates p53 at post-transcriptional level controlling both Cyclin G1 expression and
the feed-forward circuit involving p53, miR-221 and MDM2. Moreover, our results were
validated in human HCCs and in a rat model of HCC treated with Notch3 siRNAs. Our
findings are becoming an exciting area for further in-depth research toward targeted
inactivation of Notch3 receptor as a novel therapeutic approach for increasing the
drug-sensitivity, and thereby improving the treatment outcome of patients affected
by HCC. Indeed, we proved that Notch3 silencing strongly increases the effects
of Nutilin-3.With regard to therapeutic implications, Notch3-specific drugs could
represent a valuable strategy to limit Notch signaling in the context of hepatocellular
carcinoma over-expressing this receptor.

INTRODUCTION

The Notch3 receptor is highly expressed in
nearly 80% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) but
is barely detectable in surrounding cirrhotic tissue and
in normal liver [3]. Our previous study demonstrated
that a stable Notch3 silencing increases the levels of
p53 protein in HCC cell lines. However, the underlying
molecular mechanisms remain to be clarified. The tumour
suppressor p53 is a powerful anti-tumoral molecule
frequently inactivated by mutations or deletions in cancer.
Nevertheless, half of all human tumours express wildtype p53, and its activation by antagonizing the effects
of its negative regulators might offer a new therapeutic
strategy [4]. P53 is regulated by complex networks
of translational and post-translational modifications,

Understanding the complexity of cancer depends
on an elucidation of the underlying regulatory networks,
at the cellular and intercellular levels [1]. On this regard
Notch receptors have been extensively studied in the last
decade and numerous pathways that crosstalk with Notch
signaling have been described [2]. Thus, therapeutic
targeting of the Notch signaling presents both promise and
challenges. The successful development of a Notch based
targeted cancer therapy, however, will require a better
elucidation of the underlying cellular and intercellular
regulatory networks associated with the activation of this
evolutionary conserved family of receptors.

including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteosome
degradation. The MDM2 (mouse double minute protein
2) gene is induced by p53 and the protein binds the
transcriptional activation domain of p53, blocking
the recruitment of factors necessary for induction of
gene expression [5]. Moreover MDM2 targets p53 for
degradation by acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase [6]. Thus,
p53 and MDM2 form an auto-regulatory loop in which
p53 positively regulates MDM2 expression and MDM2
negatively regulates p53 [7]. The cell cycle regulator
Cyclin G1 was identified as a homologous protein to
c-src and, later, it was found to be a target gene of p53
[8, 9]. However the transcription of Cyclin G1 can be
regulated by p53-dependent and independent pathways
[10]. Cyclin G1 negatively affects the stabilization of
p53 by promoting protein degradation through a negative
feedback signaling to the p53-MDM2 auto-regulatory
module [11]. One function of Cyclin G1 is to modulate
the phosphorylation of MDM2 and thereby its regulation
of p53. Indeed the phosphorylation of MDM2 Thr216
residue was found to greatly increase in Cyclin G -/- cells
compared to wild-type MEFs leading to higher levels of
p53 protein [12]. These findings suggest that both Cyclin
G1 and MDM2 are master regulators of the p53 protein.
Here we show that p53 up-regulation in Notch3 silenced
cells is first mediated by Cyclin G1 down-regulation and
than sustained by decreased level of MDM2 due to miR221 up-regulation by p53.

to exert its effects on p53. Conversely, Notch3 overexpression has no effect on p53 mRNA level (Fig.1C).
Taken together our results suggest that Notch3 regulates
p53 at post-transcriptional level.

MDM2 protein expression is regulated by miR221 in Notch3 depleted cells
By promoting p53 ubiquitination and the consequent
degradation the MDM2 protein is the primary regulator
of p53 stability [13]. To investigate the involvement of
MDM2 in the increased levels of p53 we assessed the
expression levels of MDM2 in Notch3 depleted cells. As
shown in Fig.2A, MDM2 protein expression was reduced
in HepG2 and SNU398 cells whereas its expression was
increased in Hep3B suggesting that MDM2 is not a direct
effector of Notch3. No difference was observed in MDM2
mRNA expression in Notch3 silenced cells compared to
negative control (Fig.2B). As it was previously proven in
normal chondrocytes and in HCC cell lines MDM2 is a
predicted target of miR-221 [14, 15]. This prompted us
to investigate miR-221 expression in Notch3 depleted

RESULTS
Notch3 regulates p53 at post-transcriptional level
We previously showed that Notch3 knock-down in
HepG2 and SNU398 cell lines results in the accumulation
of p53 that exacerbated their sensitivity to doxorubicin
by inducing apoptosis. Herein we extended our study to
understand whether Notch3 regulates p53 at transcriptional
or post-transcriptional level. P53 mRNA levels were
not altered in Notch3 silenced cells as detected by Real
Time-PCR (data not shown). To further confirm the role
of Notch3 in p53 protein regulation, HepG2 cells were
transfected with human Notch3 ICN (Notch Intracellular
Domain) or vector alone (pcDNA3) and both p53 mRNA
and protein levels were analyzed. Plasmids were crosslinked with a green fluorophore and sorted to analyse only
transfected cells. We used Western blot analysis to confirm
the over-expression of Notch3 in Notch3 ICN-transfected
cells and we found a higher level of Notch3 expression
(Fig.1A), which resulted in reduced levels of p53 only at
48h post-NICD3 transfection (Fig.1A-B). The different
effect observed at different time post- NICD3 transfection
could be due to a different percentage of green cells sorted
at 24h and 48h and/or it reflects the time due to NICD3

cells and we found that it was up-regulated in HepG2
and SNU398 and down-regulated in Hep3B (Fig.2C).
Fornari et al. recently demonstrated that p53 triggers
miR-221 transcription by binding its upstream region and
that miR-221 up-regulation by p53 exerts a positive feed
back loop by targeting MDM2 [15]. This observation let
us to hypothesize that the high levels of p53 observed
in Notch3 depleted cells could increase miR-221 that,
in turn, decreases MDM2 levels. Indeed in Hep3B cells
which are TP53-/- we observed reduced levels of miR221 and increased levels of MDM2 in Notch3 silenced
cells compared to control cells (Fig.2A, 2C). Moreover
p53 silencing in Notch3 depleted cells resulted in
miR-221 down-regulation and MDM2 up-regulation
and (Fig.2D-F). These findings let us hypothesize the
contribution of p53/miR-221 axis to MDM2. However,
our results do not exclude a possible involvement of other
factors, such as the different genetic background or the
role of others microRNAs targeting MDM2.

As described above the knockdown of Notch3 in
Hep3B cells reduced miR-221 expression leading us to
hypothesize that a Notch3 target genes might affect miR221 transcription. Hes1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
type of transcriptional factor that regulates the expression
of downstream target genes and is one of primary target of
Notch signaling [16, 17]. We previously showed that Hes1
protein expression was diminished by Notch3 knockdown [18]. A bioinformatic analysis was executed in a
region spanning -2500 + 1100 bp considering +1 the first
nucleotide of miR-221 precursor. Three Hes1 consensus
sequences, S1 (+521bp), S2 (-1827 bp), S3 (- 2267 bp)
were identified. To confirm the binding of Hes1 to miR221 promoter a ChIP assay was performed as previously
describes [19]. In HepG2 cells DNA of the miR-221
promoter region could be specifically detected in the Hes1immunoprecipitated DNA complex from formaldehydetreated cells, indicating Hes1 occupancy at the miR-221
promoter (Fig.3A). Hes1 silencing with specific shRNAs,
by stable retroviral transduction (Fig.3B) determined a

of MDM2 (Fig.3B-C). These results collectively show
that Hes1 induces the transcription of miR-221 via direct
binding to its promoter region.

antibody SMP14 [24]. As shown in Figure 2A, MDM2
phosphorylation on Thr216 and Ser166 resulted upregulated and down-regulated after Notch3 knockdown
in all the analyzed cell lines respectively. Our evidences
suggest that, in the presence of functional p53, both
reduced level of MDM2 protein expression and changes in
phosphorylation status might be responsible for sustained
p53 levels in Notch3 silenced cells.

Notch3 regulates MDM2 phosphorylation at
Ser166 and Thr216
The mechanisms herein described suggest that p53
increase consequent to Notch3 knockdown is sustained but
not triggered by the p53-miR221 positive feedback loop.
Therefore other mechanisms should be responsible for
the p53 accumulation observed in Notch3 depleted cells.
The first step in p53 stabilization is the phosphorylation
of Ser20 and Ser15 that inhibits MDM2 binding [20, 21].
However we did not observe significant changes in p53
phosphorylation status between Notch3 silenced cells and
negative control (Supplemental Fig.1A) [22]. The second
step in p53 accumulation is dependent on the ability of
MDM2 to mediate p53 degradation. More specifically
MDM2 phosphorylation status regulates p53 stability.
MDM2 phosphorylated at Thr216 binds less well to p53
leading to p53 accumulation [12]. Conversely MDM2
phosphorylation at Ser166 activates MDM2 resulting in
diminished levels and decreased transcriptional activity
of p53 [23]. When MDM2 is phosphorylated at Thr216
it loses reactivity with an MDM2-specific monoclonal

P53 accumulation in Notch3 depleted cells is
triggered by Cyclin G1
To investigate the mechanisms associated with
MDM2 functional modifications observed in Notch3
depleted cells, we examined the expression of Cyclin
G1, an established regulator of MDM2 phosphorylation.
It has been shown that Cyclin G1 plays a key role
in the regulation of MDM2 phosphorylation in vivo
with corresponding impact on p53 protein. Indeed
MDM2 protein in Cyclin G1 knockout mice is hyperphosphorylated at Thr216 and the levels of p53 are
significantly higher than those in wild type mouse
embryonic fibroblasts [12]. These observations suggest a
possible involvement of Cyclin G1 in p53 up-regulation in
Notch3 depleted cells. To test this hypothesis we analyzed
Cyclin G1 protein expression and we found reduced levels
in all the analyzed cell lines in the absence of Notch3

expression (Fig.4A). To determine if lower cyclin G1
levels were associated with higher levels of p53 shown
by Notch3 KD cells, we ablated endogenous Cyclin G1
expression by transient siRNA transfection in HepG2 cells
(Fig.4C). Cyclin G1 silencing increased p53 protein levels
whereas p53 mRNA resulted unaffected (Fig.4B). Finally,
we examined whether Cyclin G1 silencing modifies the
phosphorylation status of MDM2 at Ser166 and Thr216.
Figure 4C shows that SMP14 reactivity with MDM2
protein was reduced in Cyclin G1 silenced cells compared
to negative control. Contrary, reactivity of MDM2 with
anti-phospho S166 increased in the absence of cyclin
G1. Moreover, total MDM2 protein expression resulted
independent by Cycling G1. On the mRNA side , semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis in Cyclin G1 silenced cells
revealed unchanged levels of MDM2 (Fig.4B). To establish
that the increase in p53 levels after Notch3 knockdown is
dependent on Cyclin G1, we checked p53 protein levels in
HepG2 Notch3 silenced cells and in HepG2 Cyclin G1+
Notch3 silenced cells. Notch3 depleted cells and double
silenced cells (shG1 + siN3) showed comparable p53
protein levels suggesting that Cyclin G1 is responsible for
the increased p53 protein levels in Notch3 silenced cells

(Fig.4E). No difference were observed in total MDM2 and
in MDM2 phosphorylation at Thr216 between Notch3
silenced cells and double silenced cells. As expected,
the phosphorylation status of MDM2 at Ser166 does not
change between double silenced and negative control cells
since Notch3 and Cyclin G1 have opposite effects on this
phosphorylation as above described (Fig.4E).
From the data it appears that Cyclin G1 might be
one of the reason for p53 accumulation following Notch3
depletion through regulation of MDM2 phosphorylation at
Thr216, presumably through its interaction with PP2A as
previously demonstrated [12].
The above reported results, however, are
complicated by the finding that phosphorylation of
MDM2 at Ser166 is increased in the absence of Cyclin
G1 and decreased in Notch3 depleted cells. Akt and ERK
activate MDM2 phosphorylation at Ser166 resulting in
diminishing cellular levels and transcriptional activity of
p53 [23-25]. However we showed that NC and Notch3
KD cells had very similar expression of p-ERK1/2 and
p-Akt [26] (Supplemental Fig. 1B) suggesting that these
molecules are not the mechanism through which Notch3
regulates MDM2 phosphorylation at Ser166.

To better investigate the mechanisms associated with
the reduced Cyclin G1 protein levels observed in Notch3
depleted cells, we examined Cyclin G1 mRNA expression
in the three Notch3 KD HCC cell lines used in this study.
We found that Notch3 silencing resulted in increased
Cyclin G1 mRNA expression in HepG2 and SNU398
cell lines (Fig.4D). Conversely in Hep3B TP53-/- cells
Notch3 depletion resulted in reduced levels of Cyclin G1
transcription (Fig.4D). Taken together these results suggest
that Notch3 could regulate Cyclin G1 at transcriptional
level leading to decreased Cyclin G1 protein expression in
the absence of p53, as suggested by findings obtained in
Hep3B cells. On the other hand, the discrepancy between
cyclin G1 mRNA and protein modulation following
Notch3 silencing in the presence of p53, suggests the
prevalence of post-transcriptional mechanisms. The
complex regulation of cyclin G1 expression, partly exerted
by p53, is well known and can occur at multiple levels [9].
Indeed Cyclin G1 is one of the first identified p53 target
gene [9] and p53 transient silencing resulted in decreased
Cyclin G1 mRNA levels both in HepG2 and SNU398
cells whereas MDM2 mRNA levels resulted unaffected
(Fig.4F). The simultaneous ablation of Notch3 and p53
abrogated Cyclin G1 mRNA induction that is caused by
knockdown of Notch3 alone (Fig.4G). These results let
us to hypothesize that Notch3 mediates Cyclin G1 downregulation through transcriptional and post-transcriptional
mechanisms in cells harbouring functional p53.

suggest that p53 accumulation in Notch3 depleted cells is
primarily triggered by Cyclin G1 down-regulation in vitro,
we explored whether Notch3 and Cyclin G1 co-localize
in 13 HCCs by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly
Notch3 and Cyclin G1 resulted expressed in the same
areas and a significant direct correlation between the two
proteins accumulation was present (Pearson’s correlation,
P=0.0062) (Fig.5).

Notch3 controls Cyclin G1 expression in rat HCCs
To assay whether Notch3 mediated regulation of
Cyclin G1 protein expression really occurs in primary
tumors we first analyzed Cyclin G1 and Notch3
protein expression in rat HCCs induced by DENA
(diethylnitrosamine) and found a positive correlation
between the two analyzed proteins (Pearson’s correlation,
P=0.007) (Supplemental Table 3). Then we analysed HCCs
from Notch3 siRNAs injected rats and negative controls.

Notch3 correlates with CyclinG1, MDM2 and p53
expression in human HCC
To assess to what extent our in-vitro findings
are representative of what occurs in human HCC, we
analyzed the expression of Notch3, Hes1, Cyclin G1 and
MDM2 proteins and miR-221 in 27 surgically resected
HCCs by western blot and Real-Time PCR respectively
(Supplemental Table 1-2). In addition, the 27 HCC tissues
used in the study were analysed for p53 mutations and
the correlation between Notch3 and p53 was assessed,
using Elisa, only in p53 wild-type samples. A significant
inverse correlation was determined between Notch3 and
p53 proteins accumulation (Spearman ρ= -0.575, p<0.05)
in 16 patients. A significant linear correlation was
found between Notch3 and Hes1 (Pearson’s correlation,
P=0.038) and between Notch3 and MDM2 (Person’s
correlation, P= 0.005). As expected, no significant
correlation was found between Hes1 and miR-221 in the
whole HCCs setting. Indeed, we proved that both Hes1
and p53 are involved in miR-221 regulation. Based on
this observation we analyzed miR-221 and Hes1 protein
expression in cases with mutated p53 and a positive
correlation was found (Spearman ρ= 0.709, p<0.05).
Finally, a positive correlation was found between Notch3
and Cyclin G1 (Pearson’s correlation, P=0.0063). Since we

In line with our in vitro findings Cyclin G1 protein
expression in the HCCs of RNAi group was significantly
lower than in the SC group (t-test, P=0.026) suggesting
that Notch3 inhibition can modulate Cyclin G1 expression
in vivo (Fig.6A-B). It has been shown that loss of Cyclin
G1 inhibited both the initiation stage and progression of
liver cancer induced by DENA [27]. In agreement with
this result we observed a direct correlation between
Cyclin G1 and PCNA (Pearson’s correlation, P=0.0073)
and between Notch3 and PCNA (Pearson’s correlation,
P=0.0070). Immunohistochemistry of Notch3, Cyclin
G1 and PCNA on serial sections of the liver from control

rats and rats subjected to silencing supports western blot
results (Fig.6D-F).

Notch3 silencing strengthen the effect of MDM2
inhibitors
The positive correlation between Notch3 and
MDM2 observed in vivo, suggests that the effect of
MDM2 inhibitors can be exacerbated by Notch3 silencing
independently by p53 status. Indeed MDM2 has been
shown to regulate the expression of proteins that contribute

of its interaction with p53 [28-30]. The treatment of
HepG2 and Hep3B Notch3 silenced cells with Nutilin-3
determined reduced cell invasion in both the analyzed cell
lines (Fig.7A) and increased apoptosis in Hep3B cells as
assayed by Annexin V (Fig.7B). To investigate whether
Notch3 silencing combined with Nutilin-3 can affect the
distribution through the different phase of the cell cycle

FACS analysis was performed. No changes in cell cycle
distribution was observed in Hep3B cells treated with
Nutilin-3 compared to Notch3 silenced cells (Fig.7C).
On the contrary, we observed a significantly decreased in
G1 phase population and a corresponding increase in the
G2/M phase for HepG2 Notch3 silenced cells treated with
Nutilin-3 compared to Notch3 silenced cells (Fig.7C)

DISCUSSION

and in vivo to MDM2 and stimulates the ability of
PP2A to dephosphorylate MDM2 at Thr216 leading to
p53 protein accumulation [12]. In agreement with this
observation MDM2 dephosphorylation at Thr216 was
observed both in Notch3 and Cyclin G1 silenced cells.
On the contrary Notch3 knock down cells display low
levels of MDM2 phosphorylated at Ser166 whereas
high levels were observed in Cyclin G1 silenced cells
compared to negative control. We showed that negative
control and Notch3 KD cells have very similar expression
of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt cells, suggesting that these
molecules are not associated with the reduced levels of
Ser166 phosphorylation warranting future investigation.
P53 accumulation in Notch3 depleted cells triggers the
up-regulation of its known transcriptional target miR-221
leading to MDM2 reduction and thus to the increased
p53 stability. Contrary in Hep3B TP53-/- cells reduced
levels of miR-221, in the absence of Notch3 protein, are
associated to reduced levels of Hes1 which regulates miR221 transcription. Furthermore, the combined silencing of
Notch3 and p53 in HepG2 p53+/+ cells follows the effects
observed in Hep3B, p53-deficient cells. Taken together,
our results suggest that the dominant effect on miR-221
transcription is p53 dependent. On the other hand the
positive correlation between Notch3 and MDM2 observed
in vivo, suggests that the effect of MDM2 inhibitors can
be strengthened by Notch3 silencing independently by
p53 status. In agreement with the latter, we showed that
Notch3 ablation exacerbated the response to Nutilin-3
affecting invasion. Moreover, loss of Notch3 in Hep3B
resulted in their enhanced Nutilin-3 mediated death as
revealed by Annexin V-FITC staining. In agreement with
previous studies, upon exposure to Nutilin-3, Notch3 KD
HepG2 cells accumulate in the G2/M phase of cell cycle
[33].These data indicate that Nutilin-3 induces cells to
accumulate in G2/M without significant cell death in the
presence of wild-type p53.

Notch receptors are emerging as important players
for cancer therapy [2]. Currently, most Notch-directed
therapies involve the use of gamma-secretase inhibitors
(GSIs). However the use of GSIs is associated with
intestinal toxicity in patients, due to the simultaneous
inhibition of different proteins [31]. Thus, there is a strong
rationale to target the Notch receptors individually. Our
previous studies focused on Notch3 in HCC and found
that Notch3 activity lies, in part, in the ability of Notch3
to suppress p53 expression [22]. Herein we investigated
how Notch3 regulates p53 expression and proposed a posttranslation mechanism. We draw this conclusion because
we did not observe any change in the mRNA levels of
p53 neither following Notch3 inhibition nor upon Notch3
over-expression.
The possibility that p53 stabilization was a
consequence of DNA damage activation after Notch3
ablation was ruled out, as we previously showed that
control cells had the same endogenous degree of basal
DNA damage as Notch3 depleted cells [22]. In line with
this we showed that p53(Ser-20) and p53(Ser-15) were not
significantly elevated.
Therefore, we focused on different mechanisms that
could regulate p53 stability. Stabilization is considered a
prerequisite for p53 function and cancer cells often show
alterations affecting p53 half-life, such as overexpression
of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and Cyclin G1 [11].
We show here that the increase in p53 protein
expression in Notch3 depleted cells is first mediated by
a dramatic decrease of Cyclin G1 in all the analyzed cell
lines. Indeed Cyclin G1 inhibition associated with Notch3
silencing abrogated the effect of Notch3 silencing on p53
protein expression suggesting that Notch3 silenced cells
regulate p53 protein expression mainly through Ciclin G1.
A positive correlation between Notch3 and Cyclin
G1 was confirmed in primary tumors and in HCCs arisen
in DENA treated rats. Interestingly Notch3 silencing in
vivo resulted in reduced levels of Cyclin G1 suggesting
a really involvement of Notch3 in Cyclin G1 regulation.
Moreover, a strong correlation was evident between
Notch3 and PCNA and between Cyclin G1 and PCNA
supporting a role of both Notch3 and Cyclin G1 in
cancer progression. It has been reported that DENA
administration in rat induces a high constitutive expression
of MDM2 that attenuates p53 levels [32]. In addition
p-MDM2 Ser166 was also induced in rat liver by DENA
treatment suggesting a role for pMDM2 Ser166 in p53
degradation [25] in this model. Based on these observation
MDM2 and p53 protein expression were not analyzed in
rat HCCs upon Notch3 silencing. However, according
to in vitro results the analysis of Notch3 and p53 protein
expression in p53 wild-type HCC revealed an inverse
correlation.
It has been reported that Cyclin G1 binds in vitro

Cell lines and Gene silencing by retroviral
transduction of shRNAs

Our observations let us suppose that the combination
of Notch3 silencing with MDM2 inhibitors might induce
a stronger response in HCC treatment by mediating a
“Horizontal blockade”. Future studies will be directed
towards dissecting the mechanism for this novel Notch3MDM2 crosstalk in HCC warranting in vivo studies.
Finally, no correlation was found between Notch3
and miR-221 and between MDM2 and miR-221 in our
human HCCs setting, supporting the hypothesis, that miR221 is not the only actor in MDM2 regulation in vivo.
The results add further support for the growing evidence
of the usefulness of Notch3 as a therapeutic target for
hepatocellular carcinoma.

The human hepatocarcinoma cell lines HepG2,
SNU398 and Hep3B were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).
HepG2 and Hep3B cells were maintained in Eagle’s
Minimum Essential Media (MEM) while SNU398 cells
were maintained in RPMI. Media were supplemented with
10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml of penicillin,
and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (all reagent from ATCC)
at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. Notch3 and Cyclin G1
knock down (KD) were obtained using short hairpin
oligonucleotides targeted to different exons inserted into
the pSuper.puro expression vector (OligoEngine, Seattle,
WA) as previously described [22]. Since two Notch3 and
Cyclin G1 specific shRNAs were equally effective in our
previous study [22, 34] we performed the experiments by
selecting single shRNAs. Cells harbouring a pSuper.puro
provirus expressing a GL2 luciferase specific shRNA were
used as negative control (NC) [35]. ShOligos targeted
to different Hes1 exons were purchased from Origene
(OriGene Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD) and their
efficacy was evaluated as previously described [18].

reverse
(GGCCCCCAAGATCTAAGAAC)
primers
using
Herculase Taq polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The
PCR product was inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His Topo
TA Expression Vector (Invitrogen).

Control (NC) and Cyclin G1 (shG1) silenced cells were
transfected with a pool of Notch3 siRNAs (OriGene,
MD, USA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (InVitrogen).
Evaluation of proteins expression was performed 48h
post-transfection by western blot.

RNA analysis
Total cellular RNAs were prepared with Trizol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
One microgram of total RNA were reverse-transcribed
using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Relative gene
expressions were determined by semi-quantitative endpoint PCR. PCR primers were reported in Table 1.

Real-Time PCR
MiR-221, was assessed by using Taq-Man
MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA), as previously described [38].

FACS analysis
Stably infected cell populations of HepG2 and
Hep3B were seeded into 6-well dishes and allowed to
attach for 24 hours before treatment with 5um of Nutilin-3
(Sigma). Apoptosis was revealed by Annexin V-FITC
(Bender Medsystems, Vienna, Austria) staining 48h post
Nutilin-3 treatment with Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorter
(BD FACSaria cell sorter, BD Bioscences, San jose, CA,
USA. Parenthesis cells were collected, washed twice with
PBS, fixed with 70% cold ethanol at -20°C, resuspended
in 500 µl of PBS containing 10 µg/ml propidium iodide
and 50 µg/ml RNase A and incubated for 30 min at room
temperature. Cells were then centrifugated at 1200 rpm
for 5 min, resuspended in PBS and analyzed with FACS.

Transfections
HepG2 cells were seeded into 6 well plates and
transfected with 20 nM of p53 (Invitrogen) , Cyclin
G1 (IDT, Thief River Falls, MN, USA) or scrambled
siRNA (scRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (InVitrogen).
Transfection efficiencies were greater than 90% as
determined by co-transfection with a fluorescein-labelled
siRNA (InVitrogen). For plasmid transfection cells were
seeded into 6 well plates and transfected with 0,2 μg of
pNICD-3 plasmid or empty vector using Lipofectamine
2000. Analysis of genes and proteins expression were
performed 24h and 48h post transfection.

Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion was assessed by Boyden blindwell chambers containing poly-vinyl-pyrrolidone–
free polycarbonate filters, 8-μm pore size coated with
Matrigel (Sigma). Twenty-four hours after the Nutilin-3
treatment, 5.0 × 104 HepG2 and 3.0 × 104 Hep3B cells
were resuspended in serum-free medium and added to the
upper chamber. A medium supplemented with 30% FBS
was used as chemoattractant to the lower chamber. After
24h of incubation, non invading cells were removed from
the upper surface of the filter with cotton swabs. Invasive
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with
Giemsa (Sigma), and counted under a microscope.

antibody. Immunoreactivity was revealed with the
EnVision system (DAKO), and diaminobenzidine (DAB)
as chromogen (Sigma). Slides were counterstained in
Meyer’s haematoxylin, coverslipped and examined
by light microscopy. Hepatocellular carcinomas were
categorized according to nuclear, membranous and
cytoplasmic Notch3 immunostaining. Staining of sections
was assessed on 15 consecutive 40X magnification fields
by two independent observers (L. G., C. G.) using a
validated semi-quantitative scale where 0, absence of
staining; 1, staining of 5%-30% of hepatocytes; 2, staining
on > 30% hepatocytes. Cyclin G1 and PCNA staining were
quantified by image cytometry using Image J software
(NIH, Bethesda, USA) on at least 15 randomly selected
consecutive fields at 40X and expressed as the percentage
of positive nuclei over the total nuclei (Labeling index:LI).
Results represent the average of the percentage from 15
consecutive 40X magnification fields.

Male Wistar rats (Harlan, Udine, Italy) were used in
the study. All animals received human care in accordance
to the criteria prepared by the National Academy of
Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH publication 86-23 revised 1985). All protocols were
approved by local ethic committee. DENA was given in
the drinking water (100 mg/l) for 8 weeks [38]. In vivo
delivery of siRNA was performed using 4 ug of siRNA
(Sigma) per gram of body weight. Seven rats were
included in each groups (SC and SiRNA N3). SiRNAs
were injected every 3 days into the tail vein. For tail-vein
injection siRNA was applied in a total volume of 0.5 ml
(0.25 ml of PBS, 0.25 ml In Vivo RNA-LANCEr, Sigma).
Rats were sacrificed at day 12 and freshly harvested HCCs
were subjected to protein lyses and analyzed by western
blot.

Statistical analysis

Patient samples

Differences between groups were analyzed using
a double-sided Student t-test. Experimental data are
expressed as the mean ± SE from three independent
experiments. Pearson’s correlation was used to explore the
relationships between Notch3 and Hes1, between Notch3
and MDM2, between Notch3 and Cyclin G1, between
Notch3 and PCNA and between Cyclin G1 and PCNA
expression in HCC tissues. Spearman’s correlation was
used to explore the relationships between Notch3 and p53
or miR-221 and Hes1 expression in HCC tissues. P-values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis were performed using SPSS version
19.0.

Twenty-seven patients of both sexes undergoing
partial hepatectomy for HCC entered the study. Informed
consent was obtained from each patient according to
Italian guidelines and the latest version of the Helsinki
Declaration. Exclusion criteria were a previous history
of local or systemic treatments for HCC. Tissues sample
were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded for
histopathology and immunohistochemistry.

TP53 mutation
Exons 4–10, along with flanking intronic boundaries
of the TP53 gene [GenBank Reference No. NC_000017.10
(7571720–7590863); RefSeqGeneID NG_017013.1] were
screened by WAVE denatured high-performance liquid
chromatography (dHPLC) instrument (Transgenomic,
San Jose, CA, USA). PCR products showing the presence
of heteroduplexes were directly sequenced to characterize
nucleotide variants on the ABI PRISM 3730 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), using standard protocols.
