ABSTRACT
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) plays a critical role in the survival of cancer cells
including muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The addiction of tumor cells to
HSP90 has promoted the development of numerous HSP90 inhibitors and their use in
clinical trials. This study evaluated the role of inhibiting HSP90 using STA9090 (STA)
alone or in combination with the HSP70 inhibitor VER155008 (VER) in several human
MIBC cell lines. While both STA and VER inhibited MIBC cell growth and migration
and promoted apoptosis, combination therapy was more effective. Therefore, the
signaling pathways involved in MIBC were systematically interrogated following STA
and/or VER treatments. STA and not VER reduced the expression of proteins in the
p53/Rb, PI3K and SWI/SWF pathways. Interestingly, STA was not as effective as VER
or combination therapy in degrading proteins involved in the histone modification
pathway such as KDM6A (demethylase) and EP300 (acetyltransferase) as predicted
by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. This data suggests that dual HSP90 and
HSP70 inhibition can simultaneously disrupt the key signaling pathways in MIBC.

(72% altered), and SWI/SNF (64% altered) [4]. Further
network analysis revealed a central role for the heat shock
protein 90 AA1 (HSP90AA1) gene [4].
Tumor cells utilize multiple oncoproteins to support
the tumorigenic process [5] suggesting that anticancer
therapeutic approaches should account for each of
these strategies in order to improve clinical outcomes.
Preclinical trials using HSP90 inhibitors in several cancer
models have demonstrated their ability to simultaneously
inhibit multiple oncogenic signaling pathways including
those involved in the canonical hallmarks of cancer [6].
Tumor cells have been shown to be addicted to HSP90
and high expression has been associated with poor overall
survival in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer
[7, 8]. The ability of HSP90 inhibition to simultaneously
inhibit multiple oncogenic signaling pathways had made it
an attractive anti-cancer target leading to the development
of HSP90 inhibitors, many of which are currently under
clinical investigation [9].

INTRODUCTION
Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is the
most common malignancy of the urinary tract [1]. It
develops along two distinct pathways, each with its unique
clinical presentation and molecular pathogenesis [2].
Clinically, UCB presents as either non-muscle invasive
disease or muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) [2].
Unlike non muscle invasive disease, MIBC portends a
poorer prognosis due to its inherent risk of progressing to
metastasis disease resulting in a 1 year median survival [3].
While our understanding of the molecular biology of MIBC
has improved significantly, no parallel advancement in
treatments beyond cytotoxic chemotherapy has been made
[2, 3]. Recent molecular sequencing studies have identified
genes and pathways that are key drivers of MIBC [4].
These pathways included p53/Rb (93% altered); histone
modifications (89% altered) including acetyltransferases,
methyltransferases and demethylases; RTK/Ras/PI(3)K

HSP90 belong to a class of proteins termed heat
shock proteins (HSPs) which are classified according
to their molecular weights [10]. Several other HSP
families including HSP110, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40 and
small HSPs such as HSP27 have been described [10]. In
comparison to normal cells, HSPs are expressed at a higher
level in cancer cells [11]. Cancer cells usurp the normal
function of HSPs to facilitate oncoprotein homeostasis in
an increasingly hostile environment [12]. To accomplish
this, HSPs ensure the proper folding and assembly of
their client protein complexes by a process that is highly
coordinated and mediated by number of co-chaperones
[13, 14]. Using the steroid hormone receptor as a HSP/
client protein model, the process involves the sequential
assembly of a HSP40-HSP70-Hop-HSP90 complex [15,
16]. Unfolded client proteins initially bind to a HSP40/
HSP70 complex where HSP40 stimulates HSP70ATP hydrolysis to the HSP70-ADP conformation. This
HSP70-ADP conformation favors Hop binding which
then recruits HSP90 complex to the growing multisubunit complex to form the [unfolded client proteinHSP40-HSP70(ADP)-Hop-HSP90] complex. The client
protein translocates from the HSP70 complex to the
HSP90 complex to complete its maturation [14, 16]. The
HSP70 complex dissociates and client protein maturation
and activation continues on the HSP90/co-chaperone
machinery [17].
HSP90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone
that interacts with various co-chaperones (Aha1, p23,
HSP organizing protein (Hop), Cdc37) to stabilize it
client proteins [6, 18]. This complex is regulated by ATP
binding and hydrolysis such that ATP inhibition results
in the destabilization of client proteins leading to their
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation
[19]. Over 400 HSP90 client proteins have been identified
with an updated list at http://www.picard.ch/downloads/
Hsp90interactors.pdf.
Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) share overlapping
cellular functions with HSP90. It is also an ATPdependent chaperone expressed at low levels in normal
or unstressed cells, and inducible under stressful
conditions to promote tumor cell survival [20]. Its
high expression has also been associated with poor
therapeutic outcome in some cancers and conversely, its
depletion has led to tumor regression [20, 21]. It forms
a complex with its constitutively expressed cognate
protein HSC70 [20]. Recent studies showed that dual
silencing RNA (siRNA) inhibition of both HSP70 and
HSC70 induced proteasome dependent degradation of
HSP90 client proteins, G1 cell cycle arrest and tumor
specific apoptosis [22]. These observations were not
seen when only HSP70 or HSC70 was inhibited by their
respective siRNAs [22]. The anti-apoptotic activities of
HSP70 are mediated through its interaction with multiple
partners in the mitochondrial and lysosomal signaling
cascades of apoptosis to protect cells from apoptosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[23]. Other cancer sustaining activities ascribed to
HSP70 includes the enhancement of metastasis through
interactions with proteins involved in motility and
invasion and the promotion of inflammatory conditions
in the tumor microenvironment conducive to invasion
and angiogenesis [20].
Increased expression of HSP70 is a feature of
N-terminal ATPase HSP90 inhibitors and is regarded as a
biomarker of drug activity [24]. Some have suggested that
this HSP70 overexpression may allow cells to overcome
the effects of N-terminal ATPase HSP90 inhibitor drugs
when used as monotherapy in clinical trials [25]. We
present data showing the effects of HSP90 and HSP70
inhibition alone or in combination on the growth and
invasion of human MIBC cells, induction of apoptosis
and inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways in vitro.
Our studies used the second generation N-terminal
ATPase HSP90 inhibitor STA9090 [26] and the HSP70/
HSC70 inhibitor VER155008 [27]. We propose that dual
targeting of HSP90 and HSP70/HSC70 activity in MIBC
cells may be a better therapeutic strategy than HSP90
inhibition alone.

RESULTS
Treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor STA9090
induces expression of other heat shock proteins
The upregulation of HSP70 is a well established
feature with N-terminal HSP90 ATPase inhibitors and
possibly involved in limiting the efficacy of these drugs
[28]. However, to determine whether other HSPs may
also be upregulated with N-terminal HSP90 ATPase
inhibitors, cells were treated with 1 μM STA for up to
72H and lysates were prepared and fractionated on SDS
gels. Western blots were analyzed for the expression of
HSPs indicated (Fig 1A). MIBC representing different
stages of the disease were used in this study. Both T24
and UMUC3 were derived from muscle invasive only
disease (T2), whereas J82 and SW780 were developed
from tumors that invaded the perivesical fat (T3) and
adjacent viscera (T4) respectively [29]. As expected,
increased HSP70 expression after STA treatment
was seen in all cell lines (Fig 1A, 1C–1E). However,
increased expression of the other HSPs following
STA treatment occurred in a cell dependent manner.
Expression of HSP60 was elevated in T24, UMUC3 and
J82 cells but not in SW780 cells. HSP40 was transiently
elevated in T24 cells and UMUC3 cells (compare 48H
with 72H), while in J82 and SW780 its expression was
maintained for the duration of the experiment. HSP27
expression was induced in T24, UMUC3 and J82cells
but not in SW780 cells. The expressions of HSP110,
HSP90α and HSP90β were not significantly altered in
any of the cell lines.

Combination therapy with HSP70 and 90
inhibitors was more effective at inhibiting cell
growth than monotherapy

final folded conformation [14, 16], combination therapy
was tested either sequentially or concurrently in order to
determine whether the effect on cell growth depended on
the order of the drug administration. For the sequential
treatment, cells were treated 24 h apart. (We did not
test for the optimal treatment interval nor did we have
any data to suggest a better treatment interval). Two
different drug concentrations were evaluated. The lower
concentration consisted of 100 nM of STA and/or 25 μM
of VER as monotherapy and/or dual therapy, whereas the
higher concentration consisted of 1 μM STA and 50 μM
VER. These drug concentrations were based on the IC50

Since HSP70 was reliably upregulated in all
cell lines treated with STA and thought to possess
overlapping cellular activities with HSP90, the effect of
HSP70 inhibition using VER alone or in combination
with STA on MIBC growth was tested. With the
understanding that newly synthesized client proteins
are initially recognized by HSP40/HSP70 complex and
then transferred onto the HSP90 complex to achieve its

of the drugs for each of the cell lines (Table 1). Cell
viability was determined by MTT assays at the times
noted following initiation of treatment (Fig 2A–2D).
All cell lines showed a decreased in cell viability when
treated with each of the HSP inhibitors in a time and dose
dependent manner. For the T24 and J82 cell lines, higher
doses of both STA and VER were required to achieve a
comparable decrease in cell viability seen with the other
cell lines (Fig 1B, 1C and Table 1). SW780 displayed
intermediate sensitivity to STA and VER monotherapy
at the concentrations tested, (Fig 2A and Table 1) while
UMUC3 cells were the most sensitive to cell growth
inhibition (panel D). Concurrent STA (1 μM) and
VER (50 μM) treatment for 72H showed the strongest
synergistic effect on cell viability in the SW780, J82
and T24 cell lines as indicated by the CI value of less
than one (Fig 2). On the other hand, dual therapy was
synergistic at all doses and periods of drug treatment in
UMUC cells. Dual therapy also resulted in a left shift
of the IC50 values for each drug (Table 1). Significant
differences in treatment effects on cell proliferation were
determined using the Student’s t test with a p value of
< 0.05 deemed statiscally significant. These values are
shown in Table 2.

monotherapy. Sequential combination therapy showed
a cell cycle distribution that mirrored the monotherapy
results of the first drug in the sequence. All treatments
caused a decrease in the number of cells in S phase. STA
treatments did not alter SW780 cell cycle progression as
compared to control. Interestingly, monotherapy VER
treatment arrested cells in G1. The only combination
therapy to alter cell cycle progression in SW780 was
sequential STA/VER dual therapy leading to G1 arrest.
Significance at p < 0.05 was determined by the Student’s
t test. The percentage of cells in each cell cycle from three
experiments is quantitated and shown in Fig 3E.
To verify the findings from the flow cytometry,
cell cycle specific markers were tested by Western
analysis using J82 cells after 48H and 72H of mono or
combination therapy (Fig 3E). STA treatment resulted in
decreased phosphoTyr15 CDK2 expression, no cyclin D1
expression and Aurora A expression consistent with G2
cell cycle arrest. On the other hand, VER treatment led
to increased expression of pTyr15 CDK2, phosphorylated
histone 3 and cyclin D1 suggestive of G1/M cell cycle
arrest. The cell cycle specific marker expression profile
of J82 cells treated with combination STA+VER reflected
G2/M arrest.

Effect of STA9090 and VER155008 on cell cycle

Effect of combined HSP90 and HSP70 inhibition
on apoptosis

To help elucidate potential mechanisms of these
drugs on MIBC lines, the effect of STA and/or VER
on cell cycle progression was interrogated by flow
cytometry and corroborated with cell cycle phase specific
markers by Western analysis. Flow cytometry results of
propidium iodide stained cells are shown in Fig 3A–3D.
The distribution of cells following STA and/or VER
treatments throughout the cell cycle were similar for T24,
UMUC3 and J82 cells. STA treatment was associated with
an accumulation of cells in sub G1 and G2 while VER
treatment resulted in G1 arrest. Concurrent dual therapy
showed an accumulation of cells in G2, similar to the STA

Both HSP90 and HSP70 are known to inhibit
apoptosis. Therefore, the effect of both STA and VER
alone or in combination on apoptosis was examined in
the SW780 (least sensitive) and UMUC (most sensitive)
cell lines. Apoptosis can be induced either through the
extrinsic or intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is
triggered by signals at the cell surface, while the intrinsic
pathway is activated through mitochondrial signaling
[30]. For this study, cleaved caspase 9 expression was
used as a marker of the intrinsic pathway and caspase
8 expression as a marker of the extrinsic pathway

Combination HSP90 and HSP70 inhibitor
therapy was more effective at inhibiting
cell invasion than monotherapy

VER155008 treatment does not change HSP 70
expression
Since N-terminal HSP90 ATPase inhibitors induces
HSP70 expression [28], we determined the effect of
HSP90 and HSP70 inhibition alone or in combination
on HSP70 isoforms expression in the cytoplasm or
subcellular locations by Western analysis. For combination
treatments, cells were treated concurrently or sequentially
with STA and VER (24H apart) and harvested at 48H and
72H following treatment. A significant upregulation in
the expression of overall HSP70 was seen when cells are
treated with STA while VER treatment did not alter total
HSP70 expression. Interestingly, total HSP70 expresssion
was elevated in cells treated with combined STA and
VER treatment regardless of whether they were added
concurrently or sequentially (data not shown).

MIBC are naturally invasive cells and this
characteristic is associated with poor clinical outcomes.
To evaluate the effect of STA and/or VER on the MIBC
invasiveness, cells were allowed to migrate through
Matrigel for 22 hours. Preliminary experiments indicated
that the cell invasion was significantly more sensitive to
STA than cell proliferation. A dose response curve using
both STA and VER as monotherapy on cell invasion
was generated for each cell line (data not shown). Using
the cell line specific STA and VER concentrations that
would provide 50 to 60% inhibition of cell invasion, the
effect of these agents in combination as compared to
monotherapy were tested. STA (250 nM) monotherapy
resulted in a 40–60% inhibition of cell invasion for
T24, J82 cell and SW 780 cells lines, while 100 nM
STA showed a 50% inhibition in migration for UMUC3
cells (Fig 4). VER at 50 μM showed approximately
50% inhibition of cell invasion in all the cell lines.
MIBC invasiveness was significantly impaired with
combination therapy as compared to monotherapy as
shown in Fig 4 and Table 3.

DISCUSSION

PI3K, SWI/SNF and chromatin (or histone) remodeling
pathways [4]. We determined the expression of some
of the representative pathway genes in T24 bladder
cancer cells when treated with HSP90 and 70 inhibitors
either as monotherapy or in combination. Results
shown in Fig 5A indicated that STA monotherapy and
combination therapy effectively inhibited the expression
of members of the RTK/Ras/PI3K pathway including
pAkt, TSC1, HER2, PTEN and PI3K. Conversely,
VER monotherapy had no effect on the expression of
any of the proteins tested (data not shown). Results
shown in Fig 5A show that expression of members of
the chromatin SWI/SNF remodeling pathways (BRM
and FOXO) was inhibited more with combination
therapy than monotherapy. Interestingly, the expression
of both Rb and p53 is totally inhibited with VER
monotherapy. Rb expression is also abolished by all
combinations of dual therapy. Combination therapy
appears to have little effect on expression of p53. The
expression of MYC was decreased when cells were
treated with STA but increased when cells were treated
with VER. Consequentially, MYC expression under
conditions of combination therapy was similar to control
levels.
The expression of the histone demethylase KDM6A
was also determined under conditions of HSP90 and
HSP70 inhibition. Unlike many of the signaling proteins
described above, KDM6A expression was not affected
by STA monotherapy, while VER treatment decreased
its expression (Fig 5B). To confirm this, we tested the
effect of STA and/or VER on the expression of KDM6B
and KDM4B, both histone demethylases reported to be
HSP90 client proteins [31]. As expected STA treatment
decreased both KDM6B and KDM4B expression, while
VER treatment inhibited their expression.
The differential effects of STA and VER treatment
was also observed with another member of the histone
modification pathway shown to play a role in MIBC,
namely EP300, a histone acetyltransferase. STA treatment
was not effective in degrading this protein as compared
to VER or dual therapy as shown in Fig 5B. Of note, the
effect of higher STA concentrations on protein expression

An estimated 74,000 new cases of bladder cancer are
expected in 2015 along with 16,000 deaths in the United
States [1]. At least 30% of these will present with MIBC
and if localized at diagnosis, will be managed with radical
cystectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy to reduce
the risk of the development of metastatic disease [3].
Despite our increasing knowledge about the disease and
its management, treatment outcomes for advanced bladder
cancer have not improved over the last three decades
[32]. This may be related to the heterogeneous clinical
behavior of UCB in general and MIBC in particular as
reflected by the molecular subtypes identified through
genome-wide expression and DNA-based analyses
[33]. Recently, TCGA described 4 oncogenic signaling
pathways perturbed in MIBC and highlighted a central
role for HSP90 [4].
HSP90 is a molecular chaperone for several hundred
client proteins including protein kinases and transcription
factors and plays a role in all cancer hallmarks such that
HSP90 inhibition is associated with the simultaneous
disruption of multiple tumor survival mechanisms [6],
http://www.picard.ch/downloads/Hsp90interactors.pdf. It
is therefore not surprising that HSP90 has been an
attractive anti-cancer target as compared to other targeted
agents focused on inhibiting a single pathway. HSP70
upregulation in serum or peripheral mononuclear blood
cells has served as a biomarker of HSP90 inhibitor activity
[28]. Unfortunately, the promising anti-tumor activity
anticipated from this class of drugs has not been realized
in clinical trials [34].
STA is a unique resorcinolic triazolone inhibitor of
HSP90 and is currently in clinical trials for a number of
human cancers [26]. Preclinical data demonstrated the
potency of STA in a range of solid and hematologic tumor
cell lines, including those that express mutated kinases
that confer resistance to small-molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors [35]. In comparison to the first generation,
N-terminal HSP90 inhibitors such as 17-allylamino17-demethoxygeldanamycin, STA induced degradation
of HSP90 client proteins at nanomolar concentrations,
maintained its antitumor activity longer albeit with shorter
39832

exposure times and was less toxic. These observations
were further validated in solid and hematologic xenograft
models, including models of oncogene addiction and no
evidence of cardiac or liver toxicity was seen [35].
This study sought to determine the effect of
inhibiting both HSP90 and HSP70 activity alone or in
combination on MIBC cell lines. Moreover, this study
aimed to determine whether adding a HSP70 inhibitor
in combination with a HSP90 inhibitor may abrogate
the effect of HSP70 upregulation seen with HSP90
inhibition. Finally, this study sought to identify any MIBC
oncoproteins proposed by the TCGA data that may be
resistant to HSP90 inhibition.
Examination of the HSP40/70/90 cycle reveals
a process whereby client proteins are often shuttled to
HSP90 for final protein folding [14, 16]. While there is
data to suggest that some HSP90 client protein interactions
occur without HSP70 involvement, we hypothesized that
disrupting the HSP70/90 cycle in MIBC may be a more
effective anti-cancer treatment than HSP90 inhibition
alone [35]. However, we considered that other HSPs
besides HSP70 may also be recruited by cancer cells to
compensate for HSP90 inhibition. In this study, along with
HSP70 upregulation, there was cell line specific increased
expression of both HSP27 and HSP60. While some reports
have suggested that HSP27 expression is a poor prognostic
factor [36], others have shown HSP60 expression to be
favorable [37].
The specific function of HSP70 during HSP90
inhibition in cancer cells has not been clearly elucidated.
It is clear that HSP70 can rescue proteins that have been
partially denatured, misfolded or become aggregated
[38]. This process begins with HSP40 recognizing these
aberrant or unfolded proteins and bringing them to HSP70

for proper refolding or folding as appropriate. In this
study, HSP40 was elevated transiently during HSP90
inhibition as compared to control and may be helping
to coordinate protein rescue with HSP70. However,
this function was not formally tested in this study. The
binding of HSP40/client protein/HSP70 complex confers
the correct conformation for HSP70 ATP hydrolysis as it
mediates the protein folding process [39]. HSP70 has been
shown to be upregulated in a number of cancers and vital
to their survival [40–42]. It supports cancer cell survival
by neutralizing the conformational changes in mutant
proteins [43] inhibiting cell death pathways [44, 45] and
inactivating p53 [46].
Since it appears that protein folding usually
proceeds in a coordinated fashion beginning with the
HSP70 complex assembly followed by transferring the
client protein to the HSP90 cycle [39], we tested whether
sequential additional of STA and VER vs concurrent
addition influenced cell growth inhibition, promotion of
apoptosis and inhibition of MIBC migration. Without any
data suggesting the kinetics of the nascent or unfolded
protein through these cycles, a lag time of 24 hours
between treatments was chosen. However, after noting
that concurrent STA and VER treatments as compared
to monotherapy STA or VER treatments resulted in
synergistic inhibition of both MIBC proliferation and
migration while promoting apoptosis, we elected not to
pursue the optimal sequencing of the agents in our study.
The effects of STA and VER treatments alone and
in combination revealed a cell line specific effect on
progression through the cell cycle. STA treatment led
to cell cycle arrest in G2 as shown in other studies [47]
while VER consistently caused accumulation of cell in
G1, in agreement with the results of Powers et al [22].

The combination therapy caused an increase in subG1 and
a higher accumulation in G2 when compared to control.
With respect to apoptosis, both VER and STA promoted
apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway, while VER
utilized the extrinsic pathway as well. Treatment with STA
cause increased expression of bcl-2, an accepted inhibitor
of apoptosis, most likely due to increased expression of
HSP70 which has been reported to stabilize bcl-2 [48]. On
the other hand, VER monotherapy or combination therapy
decreased the expression of both bcl-2 and XIAP (another
inhibitor of apoptosis, data not shown).
One of the premises of this study is that increased
HSP70 expression may provide a surrogate pathway for
cancer cell survival during HSP90 inhibition. However,
in this study, we continued to see increased HSP70
expression even in the presence of VER and combined
VER and STA treatments. Despite this increased HSP70
expression, cell proliferation, progression through
the cell cycle and cell migration were inhibited along
with the promotion of apoptosis. This suggested that
increased HSP70 expression may be an unreliable marker
of treatment efficacy or lack thereof. This may not be
surprising as the expression of HSP90 does not decrease
with N-terminal HSP90 ATPase inhibitors as well.
Therefore, similar to the action of HSP90 inhibitors, it is
likely that the biological effect of combination therapy
is mediated through impaired function of the ATPase
activities of these proteins rather than through their
degradation. Interestingly, we observed inhibition of the
mortalin and BiP, the mitochondrial and endoplasmic
reticulum versions of HSP70, respectively, with HSP90
inhibition. The decrease in expression of these proteins
was more enhanced with dual therapy, again suggesting
that inhibition of the activity of the cytosolic HSP70 and
HSP90 as well as inhibiting the expression of the organelle
specific HSP70 isoforms provided a better cell kill and
reduced the invasiveness of MIBC. These findings beg
the question as to which pool of HSPs is actually driving
the cellular processes involved in cell growth, apoptosis
and invasion. Since HSP70 has a known role in cellular
protein translocation between organelles [38], dissecting
the functional roles of these other HSP70 family members
in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria may offer
more selective anti-cancer therapeutic options going
forward.
TCGA identified four aberrant pathways in
MIBC [4]. A summary of the effects of STA, VER and
combination therapy on members of these pathways
is provided in Table 4. STA and not VER monotherapy
abolished the expression of proteins of the RTK/
Ras/PI3K and SWI/SNF pathways. For the p53/Rb
pathway, Rb expression was eliminated by treatment
with either drug. The antibody used in this study was
capable of recognizing all forms of Rb, i.e. both highly
phosphorylated and under phosphorylated. Contrary to

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

other studies where Rb inactivation was associated with
hyperphosphorylation of the protein [49] the treatment
with either STA or VER totally eliminated Rb expression
as did combination therapy. While deletion of Rb has been
reported in some bladder cancer cell lines (Sanger Institute
Catalogue of Somatic Mutation in Cancer http://www
.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic), this mutation has not been reported
in T24 cells. Mutation of TP53 is a common mutation
in many cancers including urinary bladder cancer [50].
Likewise, it is mutated in T24 cells, AA378C > G (Sanger
Institute Catalogue of Somatic Mutation in Cancer http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic). While STA had little effect
on expression, VER treatment eliminated any detectable
expression. Sequential therapy showed an increase in
expression whereas concurrent therapy did not. One may
speculate that this is an indirect effect in that sequential
therapy may cause degradation of an upstream regulator
that may be enhancing turnover of the protein. These
results do not address the effects of HSP inhibition on
wild type TP53. The effect of HSP inhibition on MYC is
also different than that of most of the other oncoproteins
reported by the TCGA. In this case, expression of MYC
was actually increased by treatment with VER. Again it is
possible this is an indirect effect on a upstream regulator
of expression.
One of the interesting findings of this study is the
effect of HSP90 inhibition on members of the histone
modification pathway. TCGA predicted as central role
of the HSP90AA1 gene in this pathway [4]. The stress
inducible subunit of HSP90, HSP90α is encoded by this
gene [51]. Thus, it was anticipated that along with the
aforementioned pathways in MIBC, HSP90 inhibition
would be particularly effective. However, STA at the
concentrations tested had no effect on KDMA6 expression,
a histone demethylase reported to be inactivated in 24%
of MIBC cases [4]. In addition, STA treatment had no
effect on EP300, a histone acetyltransferase mutated in
15% of MIBC cases. Interestingly, both VER treatment
and combination therapy led to their degradation. Wild
type KDM6A has been established as a tumor suppressor
gene [52, 53]. KDM6A catalyzes the demethylation
of tri/di methylated histone H3 at lysine 27 which is
associated with transcriptional activation [52] hence this
enzyme has global effects to activate either tumor growth
or suppression. EP300 in addition has global effects on
growth stimulation or suppression due to its ability to
acetylate all four core histones [54]. In addition it is known
to be a transcriptional activator. While STA treatment has
no effect on the expression of this protein, VER treatment
caused a significant decrease in EP300 expression. The
results indicate a unique role of HSP70 inhibition on the
histone modification pathway not predicted by TCGA and
stresses the importance of validating the data from next
generation sequencing (NGS) studies prior to their clinical
application.

All cell lines tested showed similar results.
Results from this study indicate how data from
NGS studies may improve the success of HSP inhibitors
in clinical trials. First, it is now possible to confirm or
disprove the activity of such therapeutic agents against
known or predicted targets in the cancers studied to
date. Our study showed that there are a subset of MIBCassociated oncoproteins that are not sensitive to HSP90
inhibition but which are sensitive to HSP70 inhibition,
and vice versa, such that the combined inhibition of both
HSP70 and HSP90 may lead to a desirable therapeutic
outcome. One limitation of this study is that not all of
the MIBC associated oncoproteins were expressed in
the cell lines tested and thus we were unable to provide
a complete compendium of the effects of HSP90 and
HSP70 inhibition alone or in combination on all of the
reported oncoproteins. Moreover, this study highlights a
potential reason for the poor response of HSP90 inhibitor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

monotherapy in MIBC clinical trials (due its inability
to disrupt all the key drivers in MIBC tumorigenesis)
and supports the use of combination HSP90 and HSP70
inhibitors therapy. While studies on established cell lines
are important, their conclusions need to be verified using
ex-vivo MIBC. Pre-clinical studies such as these may
serve as a template whereby optimal therapies can be
identified a priori by testing their ability to disrupt all of
the signaling pathways suggested by NGS data. Judging
from the results of this study, such therapeutic options will
likely require multiple agents.
In conclusion, neither HSP90 or HSP70 inhibition
alone is an effective treatment option in MIBC. However,
dual HSP90 and HSP70 inhibition was superior to
monotherapy and appears to be a promising therapeutic
alternative capable of simultaneously disrupting the
signaling pathways involved in MIBC. The ability of

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Invasion analysis

Growth of bladder cancer cell lines

Invasion analysis was performed in a Corning®
BioCoat® Matrigel invasion chamber. Chambers were
rehydrated with 500 μl of EMEM (serum free) for 2 HR
per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells (2 × 104)
were added to the upper chamber in serum free media
together with the indicated concentrations of STA9090
or VER155008 alone or in combination. Control wells
were treated with DMSO alone. Cells were allowed to
migrate toward the chemo attractant in the lower chamber
(10% FBS) for 22 hours at 37°. Inserts were removed and
stained with DiffQuik. The number of cells that invaded
through the Matrigel were counted and normalized to
chambers treated with DMSO alone.

T24, UMUC3, J82 and SW780 were purchased from
ATCC, who verified cell type authenticity. All cell lines
were grown in EMEM (Cellgro) supplemented with 10%
FBS and penn strep. Cell were harvested by trypsinization,
concentrated by centrifugation and lysed in PBS + 5 mM
EDTA and 0.5% Triton X100 containing 1 mM Na
orthovanadate and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche).

MTT assays
Cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/
well in a final volume of 100 μl in 96 well plates.
Twenty four hours after plating cells were treated with
STA9090 (MedChem Express), VER155008 (Tocris)
or the combination, at the concentrations indicated. In
experiments showing sequential addition, the second drug
was added 24H after the first addition. Final volume in the
96 well plate was 200 μl. Cells viability was determined
by MTT (3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide assays (Sigma) at the time indicated
from the beginning of treatment. Twenty microliters of
5 mg/ml MTT was added to each well and incubated
at 37° for 2 H. The media was removed and 100 μl of
DMSO added. Plates were read on a SpectraMax 220
plate reader at 570 nm. Significance was determined by
the student’s t test. Significance was set a p < 0.05. The
combination index (CI) was calculated by the Chou and
Talalay protocol [55].

Flow cytometry
Cells were plated in 100 mm dishes and treated
with DMSO (control), STA9090, VER155008 and the
combination at the concentrations indicated. Treatment
was continued for 48H after the last addition. Cells
were harvested by trypsinazation and washed with PBS
containing 2% FBS. Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol.
The fixed cells were treated with RNase A followed by
staining with propidium iodide. The distribution of cells
in each cycle was determined by flow cytometry in a
Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer. Analysis was performed
with CXP v 2.2 (Beckman Coulter)
