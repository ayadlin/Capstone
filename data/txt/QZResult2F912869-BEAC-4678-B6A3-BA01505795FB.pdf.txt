Author Manuscript

The processes associated with transition to castration independent prostate cancer growth are not
well understood. Cellular senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to
sublethal stress. It is often overcome in malignant transformation to confer a survival advantage.
CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP) β function is frequently deregulated in human
malignancies and interestingly, androgen dependent prostate cancer cells express primarily the LIP
isoform. We found that C/EBPβ expression is negatively regulated by androgen receptor activity
and that treatment of androgen dependent cell lines with anti-androgens increases C/EBPβ mRNA
and protein levels. Accordingly, we also find that C/EBPβ levels are significantly elevated in
primary prostate cancer samples from castration resistant compared with therapy naive patients.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced binding of the androgen receptor to the
proximal promoter of the CEBPB gene in the presence of dihydroxytestosterone. Upon androgen
deprivation, induction of C/EBPβ is facilitated by active transcription as evident by increased
histone 3 acetylation at the C/EBPβ promoter. Also, the androgen agonist R1881 suppresses the
activity of a CEBPB promoter reporter. Loss of C/EBPβ expression prevents growth arrest
following androgen deprivation or anti-androgen challenge. Accordingly, suppression of C/EBPβ
under low androgen conditions results in reduced expression of senescence-associated secretory
genes, significantly decreased number of cells displaying heterochromatin foci, and increased
numbers of Ki67 positive cells. Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ caused pronounced morphological
changes, reduced PC cell growth, and increased the number of senescent LNCaP cells. Lastly, we
found that senescence contributes to prostate cancer cell survival under androgen deprivation, and
C/EBPβ deficient cells were significantly more susceptible to killing by cytotoxic chemotherapy

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Prostate cancer (PC) is the most prevalent malignancy in adult men in the United States.
Although early detection and treatment of localized disease is often curative, PC remains a
leading cause of cancer death. Anti-androgen therapy is the most effective approach in
2
patients with advanced disease and induces significant responses in almost all patients.
However, androgen deprivation achieved by pharmacologic or surgical castration results in
3 4
only limited apoptosis of tumor cells , and accordingly only partial tumor regression.
Indeed after a period of disease control most patients develop castration resistant growth and
PC progression, which is responsible for the majority of the morbidity and mortality
2
associated with this disease. Identifying mechanisms that engender castration resistance is
crucial for the design of future therapeutic strategies. Progress has been made understanding
the mechanisms associated with eventual emergence of castration resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). However, less is known about the early adaptation associated with androgen
57
deprivation. -

Members of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors
are characterized by a conserved C-terminus, which contains both a DNA-binding basic
region (BR) and leucine-zipper (LZ), collectively referred to as the bZIP domain. C/EBPβ is
a widely expressed transcription factor that promotes proliferation or terminal differentiation
8
and growth arrest in several different cell types. These opposing functions seem to be
regulated by the expression of different C/EBPβ translational isoforms from three in frame
9 10
start codons within an intron-less mRNA. , The two high molecular weight C/EBPβ
isoforms, termed liver-enriched activating proteins (LAP and LAP*), contain N-terminal
transactivation domains (TAD), whereas the liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) lacks
these TADs. LIP can dominantly inhibit LAPs and other C/EBP members via
11
heterodimerization or by recruiting transcriptional repressors. C/EBPβ activity affects
several facets of PC disease progression. C/EBPβ regulates the expression of steroidogenic
12 13
genes including StAR and cytochrome p450 aromatase, , and its activity is modulated in
14 17
response to dihydrotestosterone, estrogen and progesterone. - It has also been suggested
18 19
that C/EBPβ can act as a co-repressor of the androgen receptor (AR) in PC. , Although
C/EBPβ is not detected in healthy prostate, luminal epithelial cells up-regulate C/EBPβ in
20
the case of proliferative-inflammatory atrophy, a precursor to PC, and C/EBPβ
21 22
participates in the regulation of metastatic genes and PC cell survival. , However, the
contribution of C/EBPβ to the emergence of castration resistant growth has not been
previously investigated.

Cellular senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to a variety of
23 24
intrinsic and extrinsic sublethal stress stimuli. , Accumulating data point to an important
23 24
role of senescence in cancer progression. , Recently, several groups demonstrated that in
response to androgen deprivation PC cells undergo senescence, and that the acquisition of
57
senescence is associated with emergence of castrate resistant growth. - In other lineages C/
EBPβ and its downstream target genes are critical for the induction and maintenance of
oncogene induced senescence, associated with over-expression of activated Ras or
8 25 26
BRAF. , , C/EBPβ can directly bind to target gene promoters and enhancers to induce
senescence-associate factors IL-6 and IL-8, but can also suppress E2F-1 target genes and
8
induce growth arrest dependent on E2F:pRb.

Author Manuscript

We now demonstrate that upon androgen deprivation C/EBPβ is rapidly up-regulated in
androgen dependent PC cells and that AR binds to and suppresses the C/EBPβ proximal
promoter. Increased expression of C/EBPβ under these conditions is necessary for
acquisition of the senescent phenotype. Accordingly, preventing C/EBPβ up-regulation
increases the susceptibility of PC cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy.

Results
CRPC is associated with increased CEBPB
To determine whether C/EBPβ levels correlate with human prostate cancer progression we
27
28
interrogated the Oncomine database. In the Grasso et al data set that included gene
expression patterns from 28 benign prostate tissues, 59 localized PC, and 35 CRPC samples
CEBPB expression was significantly (p<1.9 × 10−6) elevated in CRPC compared with
localized disease (Figures 1a, 1b).

Inhibition of AR induces CEBPB transcription

Author Manuscript

Treatment of LNCaP cells with the synthetic AR agonist R1881 for 24 hrs results in a dosedependent 2.5-fold decrease in CEBPB mRNA and protein expression (Figures 2a, 2b), and
as expected, prostate specific antigen (PSA) transcript levels increased under these
conditions. Conversely, culturing LNCaP cells in androgen depleted media (ADM) for 7
days resulted in a significant 3.8-fold increase in C/EBPβ expression (Figure 2c).
Pharmacologic inhibition of the AR using bicalutamide resulted in a dose dependent rise in
CEBPB transcript abundance, achieving a 7.5-fold increase at the highest dose tested (Figure
2d). Accordingly, we detected increased protein levels of C/EBPβ in both LNCaP and
LAPC4 cells treated with bicalutamide, or flutamide (Figure 2e). Since bicalutamide, or
flutamide may have an AR agonist effect we also tested the effect of enzalutamide, which
does not have agonistic effects. Similar to bicalutamide, incubation with 20 μM
enzalutamide resulted in increased C/EBPβ levels (Figure 2f). CEBPB RNA levels were
rapidly up-regulated within 4 hrs of exposure of LNCaP cells to bicalutamide (Figure 2g).
To assess binding of AR to the CEBPB promoter, LNCaP cells were cultured in full media
and subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. Precipitated DNA was
amplified using primers spanning the proximal (-131 to -242 bp) or distal (-2098 to -1983
bp) regions of the human CEBPB promoter. We observed AR binding to the proximal but

not the distal region (Figure 3a). Next, CEBPB-luc, containing proximal promoter region
(−888 to +64) linked to a luciferase reporter, was co-transfected into LNCaP or DU145 PC
cells with CMV-β-galactosidase as internal control. Reproducibly, luciferase activity
significantly decreased by 2.5-fold in LNCaP cells cultured with 1 nM R1881 for 24 hrs
compared with vehicle control (Figure 3b). This effect on CEBPB promoter activation was
mediated by the AR as R1881 did not reduce luciferase activity in similarly transfected
DU145 cells which lack AR. Treatment of LNCaP cells with bicalutamide for 4 hours
induced acetylation of histone H3 bound to the CEBPB proximal promoter, whereas culture
with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) suppressed this mark of active transcription (Figure 3c).
Importantly, we did not observe significant changes in the half-life of CEBPB RNA in
response to bicalutamide, indicating that the stability of CEBPB transcripts was unaffected
(Figure 3d). Collectively, these results show that the AR suppresses transcription of CEBPB.

Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ suppresses LNCaP cell growth

Author Manuscript

Because C/EBPβ expression was inversely regulated by AR activity, an essential signal for
PC cell growth, we next evaluated whether ectopic expression induces growth arrest similar
to androgen deprivation. C/EBPβ was inducibly expressed in LNCaP cells using the Tet29
regulated transposon-based piggyBac vector and cells with stable integration of the
transgene or an empty vector (TRE) control were selected by puromycin (2 mg/ml).
Treatment of LNCaP PBCEBPB cells with doxycycline for 5 days induced an increase in the
expression of C/EBPβ 2.5-fold (Figure 4a), similar to the increase seen in LNCaP cells
cultured in enzalutamide. C/EBPβ forced expression was associated with increased levels of
the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4A and p15INK4B and a flattened morphology (Figure 4a, 4b).
Next, we tested the effect of C/EBPβ overexpression on LNCaP cell proliferation. Equal
numbers of LNCaP PB-CEBPB or PB-TRE control cells were seeded in doxycycline
containing media and enumerated after 3 and 5 days. Ectopic C/EBPβ expression resulted in
a significant 2.3-fold decreased rate of proliferation (figure 4c) and a significantly increased
number of Ki67 negative cells 5 days after doxycycline treatment (figure 4d) without
increased cell death (figure 4e). These data demonstrate that elevated levels of C/EBPβ are
sufficient to suppress the growth of androgen-sensitive PC cells.

C/EBPβ is required for complete maintenance of androgen deprivation induced growth arrest
Persistence of PC cells under androgen-deprived conditions is an initial step towards
development of castration resistant growth. Upon androgen deprivation LNCaP cells
57
undergo cell cycle arrest and enter a senescent state. - Importantly, androgen deprivationinduced senescence is only partly reversible and cells continue to display senescence
6
markers and poor proliferation after re-exposure to androgen. Because C/EBPβ
upregulation was associated with androgen deprivation and its expression sufficient to
suppress LNCaP proliferation, we next targeted C/EBPβ to test its function in androgendeprivation-induced growth arrest. We utilized two independent methods: inducible shRNA
30 31
and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). , We designed a pair of
TALENs to target the CEBPB gene, transfected LNCaP cells, and screened individual clones
for C/EBPβ expression. Subclone 6, was identified as having CEBPB knockdown
(presumably due to incomplete targeting of all alleles in the polyploid LNCaP cells) (Figure
5a), and used in our subsequent experiments. A complete stable deletion of all CEBPB

alleles could not be achieved, suggesting C/EBPβ plays a critical role for cell survival. As
control we employed subclone 1 in which C/EBPβ expression is similar to that observed in
parental cells. In addition, C/EBPβ expression was effectively knocked down in LNCaP cells
utilizing a doxycycline inducible shRNA against CEBPB (shCEBPB) compared with a nontargeting vector control (shNTV) (Figure 5b). We used flow cytometry to investigate the
effect of C/EBPβ depletion on PC cell cycle distribution (Figure 5c). For these studies we
employed cells expressing the inducible shRNA as stable deletion of C/EBPβ via TALEN
required adaptation to low C/EBPβ levels. Cells expressing shCEBPB or shNTV both went
into G1 cell cycle arrest when cultured in androgen depleted media (ADM) (Figure 5c).

Author Manuscript

The growth arrest induced by androgen deprivation is associated with changes in cell cycle
inhibitors including p16INK4A, p15INK4B and p21WAF1. Because C/EBPβ has been shown to
regulate the expression of these genes, we next evaluated their expression in LNCaP cells
following androgen deprivation. The levels of p16INK4A, p15INK4B and p21WAF1 proteins
were diminished in C/EBPβ deficient cells compared with shNTV cultured in ARM or ADM
(Figure 5d). In contrast to p15INK4B and p21WAF1, p16INK4A protein levels mildly increased
in shCEBPB cells following culture in ADM, compared to culture in ARM. However,
p16INK4A levels in shCEBPB cells are markedly lower compared to shNTV control cells
cultured in either ARM or ADM (Figure 5d).

Author Manuscript

To evaluate whether C/EBPβ is required to maintain growth arrest of LNCaP cells
challenged by androgen deprivation, we pre-cultured LNCaP cells harboring shNTV or shC/
EBPβ in ADM or androgen-replete media (ARM) with doxycycline for 7 days, re-seeded
equal number of cells in ARM and enumerated viable cells 5 days later (Figure 6a). As
expected from the observed inhibition of G1 to S cell cycle progression (Figure 5c), culture
in ADM for 7 days resulted in diminished cell accumulation (not shown). Although in ARM
the rate of proliferation of shCEBPB cells was modestly lower than shNTV cells, C/EBPβ
knockdown was associated with a better, although incomplete, recovery of proliferation after
pre-culture in ADM (Figure 6b).

Author Manuscript

Charcoal stripped FBS lacks androgen and multiple other growth factors. To define the
specific effect of androgen-depletion, LNCaP cells harboring shNTV or shCEBPB were precultured with doxycycline and bicalutamide, enzalutimide, or vehicle for 4 days, and
subsequently re-plated at equal numbers in ARM without inhibitors (Figure 6a). In contrast
to shNTV cells which demonstrated 2-fold decreased recovery, CEBPB depleted cells
completely recovered their proliferation once released from AR-inhibition (Figure 6c). To
better reflect recovery and adjust for the different proliferation rate in ARM of shCEBP
compared to shNTV cells, we also plotted these data as a ratio of growth of cells precultured in ADM, bicalutamide, or enzalutimide to cells pre-cultured in ARM (Figure 6d).
This normalization highlights the recovery of proliferation of shCEBPB compared to shNTV
cells in each experiment, indicating that C/EBPβ is required for maintenance of complete
growth arrest induced by androgen deprivation and its suppression alleviates the phenotype,
at least in part.

C/EBPβ elevation induces senescence

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Because C/EBPβ seemed to play a role in maintaining growth arrest following androgen
deprivation, we next evaluated whether over-expression of C/EBPβ was sufficient to induce
senescence in LNCaP cells. Senescent cells are characterized by an increase in cell volume,
granularity and lysosomal mass indicated by senescence associated β-galactosidase (SA-β32
gal) activity. Compared to control PB-TRE, PB-CEBPB cells had a significantly increase
in the number SA-β-gal positive cells and the level of cell granularity, as assessed by side
scatter, (Figures 7a and 7b). Expression of several secreted gene products is elevated in
senescent cells and is referred to as the senescence associated secretory phenotype
24
(SASP). Release of these secreted factors promotes paracrine growth arrest, and C/EBPβ
25 33 34
was shown to be central to induction of SASP genes. , , Accordingly, overexpression of
C/EBPβ led to a significant increase in the transcript levels of two SASP-associated genes,
IL8 and IGFBP3 (Figure 7c). Similarly, we observed increased IGFBP3 and IL8 levels upon
androgen deprivation, which was abrogated by either CEBPB shRNA or TALEN targeting
(Figures 7d and 7e). Another feature of senescent cells is accumulation of tightly packed
heterochromatin foci (HF) characterized by increased di- or trimethylated histone 3 on
35
lysine 9 (H3K9me2, H3K9me3). When cultured in ADM, LNCaP-shNTV cells display a
2-fold increase in the number of HF positive cells. In contrast, we did not observe an
increase in HF in shCEBPB cells cultured under similar conditions (Figure 7f). Senescent
cells exit cell cycle, and stain negative for Ki67. A similar proportion of shNTV or
shCEBPB cells expressed Ki67 in ARM. However, the proportion of Ki67-negative cells
after one week of culture in ADM was 2-fold lower in cells lacking C/EBPβ (Figure 7g).
Together, these data indicate that in PC cells C/EBPβ is necessary for induction of
senescence upon androgen-deprivation.

Author Manuscript

Cellular senescence engenders a pro-survival phenotype. Given rapid induction of C/EBPβ
in the absence of AR signaling and its role in directing senescence, we evaluated whether
targeting C/EBPβ synergizes with anti-androgen agents or chemotherapy in killing PC cells.
Culture of LNCaP shNTV and shCEBPB in ADM (Figure 8a) or exposing them to
bicalutamide (Figure 8b) increased the number of dead cells relative to ARM cultures.
However, there was no difference in cell viability between shNTV and shCEBPB cells
(Figure 8a and 8b). However, after pre-culture in ADM, treatment with docetaxel or
etoposide induced a significant 68% or 55% increase in cell death, respectively, in LNCaP
cells harboring shCEBPB compared with shNTV (Figure 8c). Together, these data
demonstrate that C/EBPβ promotes a pro-survival, drug-resistant phenotype during androgen
deprivation.

Discussion
Accumulating evidence points to a strong connection between senescence and tumor
23 24 36
progression. , , Oncogene induced senescence promotes the eventual emergence of
subpopulations of aggressive, malignant cells and thus may be considered a tumor
promoting state. In PC, androgen deprivation induced senescence promotes the development
5
of tumor progression and resistance to apoptosis, fostering the emergence of cancer
37
initiating cells. Increased numbers of senescent cells have been observed in tissue sections

from tumors in patients that had been treated with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation
7
therapy. Also, cellular senescence induced by androgen deprivation dramatically increases
reactive oxygen species and DNA double-strand breaks, and leads to the outgrowth of
5
hormone-refractory populations in cultured LNCaP cells. CRPC emerges as a result of
multiple adaptations, including AR gene amplification, abnormal AR activation, or enhanced
2
steroidogenesis. These changes are acquired and propagated as a result of selective pressure
exerted on PC cells by an androgen poor milieu while cells are protected by the androgen
deprivation-induced senescence state. Previous reports have suggested that androgen
deprivation leads to a senescent state in both LNCaP and LAPC4 cells, but the mechanism
57
by which these cells become senescent was not well described. - Here, we demonstrate that
PC cells respond to androgen withdrawal by up-regulating CEBPB transcription, that loss of
C/EBPβ lead to a reduction in the number of senescent cells following androgen deprivation,
and that ectopic expression of C/EBPβ induces the expression of senescent markers
indicating that C/EBPβ plays a central role in cellular senescence induced by androgen
deprivation, and that impeding the senescent response via inhibition of C/EBPβ expression
keeps PC cells susceptible to chemotherapy, validating C/EBPβ as a therapeutic target in
androgen dependent PC.

Author Manuscript

Probing the Oncomine database revealed elevated expression of CEBPB in human CRPC
samples. As CRPC is often characterized by active AR signaling, this finding may
seemingly be at odd with our in vitro data showing that AR activity suppresses C/EBPβ
expression. Several potential explanations may account for elevated C/EBPβ levels despite
active AR signaling in CRPC. It has been demonstrated that there is substantial divergence
38
in AR gene targets when comparing castrate-resistant to androgen sensitive cells. Further,
androgen deprivation or castration-resistance is associated with decreased AR occupancy on
39
repressive DNA elements and the expression of many AR-repressed genes increases in
39
castrate-resistant cells. Finally, although castrate-resistant cells often exhibit increased
levels of AR, AR signaling relative to androgen sensitive prostate cancer cells may not
increase because of diminished ligand levels. Therefore, C/EBPβ de-repression may persist
in cells that have developed castration-resistance.

Author Manuscript

Our data demonstrate that inhibition of AR leads to rapid upregulation of CEBPB RNA, loss
of AR interaction with the CEBPB promoter, and increased promoter H3K acetylation. To
our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that CEBPB is a direct AR transcriptional
repressive target. This observation is consistent with previous reports showing that AR can
inhibit gene expression through interaction with transcriptional co-repressors at proximal
40 4142
promoter regions. ,
Derepression of CEBPB occurs within 4 hours of exposure to antiandrogens. Conversely, treatment with AR agonist R1881 results in diminished expression
of C/EBPβ and suppression of the activity of a CEBPB promoter luciferase reporter.
Accordingly, exposure to DHT leads to a decrease in activating AcH3 histone marks on the
promoter. These findings indicate that AR suppresses CEBPB expression directly through
regulation of the promoter. Examination of the CEBPB promoter sequence did not identify
an androgen response element (ARE), suggesting indirect binding of AR. In other contexts,
AR directly interacts with Sp1 to regulate gene expression in the absence of an ARE making
43 44
Sp1 a potential mediator of AR regulation of CEBPB. ,

Treatment of LNCaP cells with anti-androgens or culture in hormone-depleted media leads
to G1 arrest and cellular senescence. PC cells require AR signaling for transition from G1 to
S and accordingly we did not observe continued proliferation of cells that had been cultured
in hormone depleted media or with anti-androgens regardless of CEBPB knockdown.
Androgen deprivation induced senescence had a profound long-lived effect on PC cell
proliferation in the presence of normal C/EBPβ levels even after reintroduction of
6
androgens, as previously observed. We found that after androgen deprivation, C/EBPβ
deficiency allowed LNCaP cells to resume proliferation when re-seeded in ARM. Thus, C/
EBPβ plays an important role in the complete maintenance of senescent growth arrest
induced by androgen deprivation.

Senescent cells develop unique secretory paracrine activities, conferring a pro-malignant
microenvironment by secreting an array of cytokines and proinflammatory
24 45 46
mediators. , , Our results raise the possibility that C/EBPβ also promotes the expression
of senescence-associated secretory genes such as IL-8 and IGFBP3 and the cell cycle
inhibitors p21WAF1 and p15INK4B. IL-8 signaling has been shown to promote cell survival,
8 47 48
angiogenesis and senescence in pre-clinical models of PC. , , It activates the PI3K-AKT49
mTOR pathway, which is critical for cell survival during androgen deprivation. IGFBP3 is
strongly upregulated following androgen deprivation and promotes tumor growth in a mouse
50 51
PC model. , In PC patients the percentage of cells positive for p15INK4B was shown to
52 54
increase with tumor grade. - Expression of p21WAF1 correlates with a worsened
prognosis both before and after androgen deprivation therapy, and in vitro studies of
55 57
p21WAF1 have shown that it suppresses apoptotic response to chemotherapy. - These
findings are consistent with our results showing that C/EBPβ deficient cells, with decreased
p21WAF1 and p15INK4B levels, were more sensitive to chemotherapy post-androgen
withdrawal. Increased p16INK4A expression is not essential to androgen induced
5
senescence, and we see suppression of p16INK4A in C/EBPβ deficient LNCaP cells.
Overall, C/EBPβ promotes PC senescence and thereby potentially chemo-resistance and
progression to castration-resistant growth through multiple transcriptional targets during
androgen deprivation therapy (Figure 8d).
Our delineation of CEBPB upregulation in human hormone-refractory PC further support
the concept that C/EBPβ-dependent induction of senescence during androgen blockade
promotes castration-resistant progression by providing the opportunity to respond the
selective pressure of anti-androgen therapy. Importantly, these data indicate the potential
utility of targeting C/EBPβ in combination with androgen deprivation for novel PC therapy.

with vehicle (0.01% ethanol) or the androgen agonist R1881 (Sigma-Aldrich) and after
additional 24 hrs lysed (Reporter Lysis Buffer, Promega) and assayed for luciferase and βgalactosidase activity. Fold activation relative to the vehicle treated cells after correction for
β-galactosidase activity was determined. Lysates from non-transfected cells were used as
baseline.
TALEN construction and CEBPB gene editing

Author Manuscript

TALEN DNA constructs targeting the human CEBPB ORF were constructed using the
30
Golden Gate Talen assembly kit (Addgene. Cambridge, MA USA). Targeting sequences
were designed using the Cornell University TAL Effector Nucleotide Targeter 2.0 web based
software. Golden Gate assembly of the repeat-variable di-residue sequence was performed
according to the manufacturer's instructions and the completed TALEN pairs were ligated
into the pTAL3 vector. The complete TALEN ORF including the repeat-variable and FokI
domains was excised using XhoI and ApaI restriction endonuceases and ligated into the
pcDNA3.1(+) vector. LNCaP cells cotransfected with TALEN expression vectors targeting
CEBPB were seeded in 96 well dishes, and individual clones were screened for C/EBPβ
expression by Western blotting.
DNA content analysis and Flow cytometry
60

Cell cycle analysis by DNA content was performed as previously described. Ki67
expressing cells were identified by flow cytometry using APC-anti-Ki67 antibody
(BioLegend, San Diego, CA). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a BD
FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences), Sub-cellular debris and dead cells were gated out
and singlet discrimination was performed by gating on FL2-A and FL2-W channels and data
were interpreted using FloJo Cytometric Analytical software (TreeStar).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
58

5E6 LNCaP cells were used in each ChIP reaction as previously described, using
antibodies against C/EBPβ, AR, rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or acetylated
histone H3 (06–599) (Millipore, Billerica, MA USA). DNA fragments corresponding to the
promoters of interest were detected by PCR using the primers presented in Table 1.
Cell viability and proliferation assays

Author Manuscript

Viability was determined using the WST-1 assay (Roche). Briefly, cells were seeded into 96
well plates, allowed to adhere for 48 hrs and then treated for an additional 48 hours. WST-1
reagent (Roche) was directly added to the wells and after incubation absorbance was read at
450 nm using a BioRad Microplate Reader Model 680. The 670 nm reference absorbance
and readings from blank wells containing only cell culture media and DMSO (vehicle) were
subtracted from experimental wells. Relative viability was determined by dividing
absorbance readings from vehicle treated wells. For cell proliferation, LNCaP cells were
grown for 7 days in growth or hormone-depleted media. Cells were trypsinized, stained with
Trypan blue dye and viable cells were enumerated using a hemocytometer. 1.5E5 cells per
well were seeded into 6-well plates in ARM. After 5 days cells were similarly enumerated.

SA-β-Gal Chromogenic Assay

Author Manuscript

61

SA-β-Gal positive cells were stained using the chromogenic assay as described. Five
random fields of view were imaged on a Leica E600 microscope by brightfield microscopy
at 200x magnification. Positive cells were identified as those containing blue precipitate
throughout the cytoplasm.
Immunofluorescent staining and SAHF-quantification

Author Manuscript

LNCaP cells were seeded onto Poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips and following
treatment were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed and incubated in
permeabilization buffer (TBS, 2% BSA, 0.5% Triton-X 100, 0.1% sodium azide). After
blocking, cells were incubated with anti-di/trimethyl H3K9 (1:250, Cell Signaling
Technology Danvers, MA USA), washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse-Alexafluor
488 conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies). Cells were washed and mounted on
glass slides for analysis by fluorescence microscopy. SAHF were imaged on a Leica E800
fluorescence microscope with a CCD camera and imaged at 630X magnification with an oil
immersion objective. Fluorescent micrographs of SAHF from 6-7 random fields of view
were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health Bethesda, MD USA). Intensely
stained nuclei with multiple fluorescent foci that colocalized with DAPI staining were
counted as positive cells containing SAHF.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Statistical comparison of two groups of samples was conducted using the Student's t-test.
Comparisons of multiple groups of samples was performed using the analysis of variance
followed by multiple comparisons with the Student's t-test and the Holm-Bonferonni
Correction (α/(n-k+1), where n = number of comparisons and k = rank of p-value).

C/EBPβ is required for high expression levels of cell cycle inhibitors upon AR inhibition. (a)
Total cellular proteins extracted from parental (P) LNCaP cells or individual clones
transfected with TALEN-C/EBPβ were subjected to Western blotting using C/EBPβ or actin
antibodies. (b) LNCaP cells harboring an inducible shRNA against C/EBPβ (shC/EBPβ) or
non-targeting vector (NTV) were cultured with doxycycline (200 ng/ml) for 48 hrs and
protein extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. (c) LNCaP
cells harboring shCEBPB or non-targeting vector (shNTV) cultured with doxycycline (200
ng/ml) in androgen replete (ARM) or androgen depleted media (ADM) for 7 days, were
stained with propidium iodide and DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry. Mean
distribution of cells in G1, S, or G2/M from three experiments. (d) LNCaP cells expressing
shNTV or shCEBPB were cultured in ARM or ADM for 7 days and the expression of the
indicated cell cycle regulators was assessed by Western blotting.

C/EBPβ is required for complete maintenance of growth arrest induced by AR inhibition in
LNCaP cells. (a) LNCaP cells expressing shCEBPB or shNTV were pre-cultured in
doxycycline under the indicated conditions or in ARM control media, 1.5E5 cells from each
pre-culture condition were replated and enumerated after 5 days, as depicted in the diagram.
(b) After 7 days pre-culture in ARM or ADM equal number of shCEBPB or shNTV LNCaP
cells were re-plated in ARM in a 6-well dish and counted 5 days later. The average foldincrease in cell number is shown. (c) Similarly, cells were pre-cultured for 4 days with
bicalutamide (Bic), enzalutamide (Enz), or vehicle control and doxycycline, re-plated in
ARM and enumerated after 5 days as described above. (d) The relative growth ratio of cells
pre-cultured in ADM, bicalutamide (Bic), or enzalutamide (Enz), over cells cultured in
ARM control conditions. Bar graphs represent the mean of at least three experiments ±SEM;
* p<0.05; ** p<0.005.

C/EBPβ is required for androgen deprivation induced senescence. (a) The percent of SA-βgal-positive PB-TRE or PB-CEBPB cells was quantified after 5 days of culture in 0.5 μg/ml
doxycycline. An average from 3 experiments (left) and representative images are shown
(right). (b) Quantification of cell granularity by the median side scatter value of G1 PB-TRE
and PBCEBPB cells 5 days after seeding in doxycycline. A representative histogram is
shown on the right. (c) IL8 and IGFBP3 expression were quantified by qRT-PCR in PB-TRE
and PB-CEBPB cells cultured under the above conditions. Conversely, total cellular RNA
was extracted from shNTV or shCEBPB (d), or TALEN-control or TALEN-KD (e) LNCaP
cells after 7 days in culture in ARM or ADM and transcript levels of IL8 and IGFBP3 were
assessed by qRTPCR. (f) Expression of an shRNA against CEBPB or non-targeting vector
(shNTV) control were induced by doxycycline in LNCaP cells cultured in androgen replete
(ARM) or depleted media (ADM). After 7 days cells were stained for senescence associated
heterochromatin foci (HF) (yellow arrows). Red arrow points to HF negative cell.
Representative photomicrographs are shown (left, 600X magnification). The average and
standard error of three independent counts is shown (right panel). *p<0.001. (g) Ki67 was
quantified using flow cytometry in shNTV or shCEBPB LNCaP cells cultured in ARM or
ADM for 7 days and the average proportion of Ki67 negative cells from 3 experiments is
presented. *p<0.01.

C/EBPβ protects from chemotherapy following androgen deprivation. (a) LNCaP cells were
cultured for one week in ARM or ADM and cell death was evaluated flow cytometric
analysis of sub-G1 DNA content. (b) LNCaP shNTV or shCEBPB lines cultured in ADM
were exposed to bicalutamide at the indicated dose for 48 hrs and relative cell viability was
evaluated by the WST-1 assay. The average cell viability from 3 independent experiments is
shown. (c) LNCaP lines harboring shNTV or shCEBPB were cultured for 7 days in
androgen depleted media (ADM), re-plated in androgen replete media (ARM), and treated
with vehicle control, 10 nM docetaxel (Doc), or 10 μM etoposide (VP16) for 48 hours. Cell
survival was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and the average percentage of dead cells
from 3 independent experiments is shown. (d) Model of the regulation of C/EBPβ
expression by AR. Upon AR inhibition C/EBPβ expression will increase to promote
senescence, chemoresistence, and emergence of CRPC.
