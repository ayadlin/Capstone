Abstract
The synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR)
has shown potential as a chemopreventive and therapeutic
agent. The ability of 4HPR to enhance production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) leading to apoptosis has been suggested
as a possible mechanism underlying these effects. We explored
the possibility that ROS induction by 4HPR involves the small
GTPase Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac), a
regulatory subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. Rac was
activated in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) cells as early as 5 minutes following 4HPR exposure.
Moreover, inhibition of Rac activity or silencing of its
expression by RNA interference decreased ROS generation in
human head and neck, lung, and cervical cancer cells and
murine melanoma cells. In HNSCC UMSCC-22B cells, this
decrease correlated with reduction in apoptosis induction by
4HPR. Expression of a constitutive active mutant Rac
increased basal and 4HPR-induced ROS generation and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In addition, the
metastatic DM14 cells exhibited higher Rac activation
following 4HPR treatment compared with the primary
Tu167-C2 cells. Furthermore, the metastatic cancer cells
tested exhibited higher ROS generation and growth inhibition
due to 4HPR exposure compared with their primary cancer
cell counterparts. These findings show a preferential susceptibility of metastatic cells to the proapoptotic retinoid 4HPR
through Rac activation and support the use of ROS-inducing
agents such as 4HPR against metastatic cancer cells. [Cancer

Introduction
Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a natural process for
elimination of defective cells such as those bearing detrimental
mutations or alterations in important cellular processes (1). It is
now well appreciated that evasion of apoptosis represents a major
mechanism that drives tumor growth and is considered a hallmark
of most, if not all, cancers (2). Therefore, induction of apoptosis is
increasingly recognized as a desired effect for chemopreventive and
therapeutic agents because it results in the elimination of
premalignant or malignant cells (3, 4).
One promising anticancer agent, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide
(4HPR), also known as fenretinide, which exhibits a substitution of
an amide-linked 4-(hydroxyphenyl) group for the carboxyl group of
all-trans retinoic acid, was first shown to prevent breast cancer in
rats (5). In addition, fenretinide displayed markedly reduced
adverse side effects such as liver toxicity compared with the

natural retinoid all-trans retinoic acid (6). Moreover, 4HPR showed
efficacy as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent in various
experimental models and clinical trials (7). In addition, 4HPR was
effective in clinical trials aimed at chemoprevention of oral
leukoplakias recurrence and new incidence in postsurgical patients
(8) as well as patients resistant to natural retinoids (9). 4HPR was
also shown to significantly reduce the risk of second breast cancer
in premenopausal women, the effect of which persisting for several
years after treatment cessation in a 15-year-long randomized phase
III trial for breast cancer prevention (10). In addition and more
recently, 4HPR was shown to significantly delay onset of ovarian
cancer (11).
The proposed mechanism for the above-mentioned 4HPRinduced effects was induction of apoptosis based largely on earlier
studies, which have shown that 4HPR can induce apoptosis in a
variety of cell lines including head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) cells (12). Apoptosis induction by 4HPR is
mediated by various mechanisms including ceramide induction
(13), triggering of the mitochondrial pathway and modulating
mitochondrial membrane permeability and cytochrome c release
(14), activation of lipoxygenase 12 (15), nitric oxide production (16),
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (12, 17–19). The
increase in ROS generation can cause sustained activation of
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and other mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK; refs. 20–22), triggering of the mitochondrial pathway (19), and, more recently, induction of endoplasmic
reticulum stress (23), all of which seem to be downstream of ROS
and to contribute to cell death induction. Whereas these studies
have highlighted the pivotal role of the downstream effects of ROS,
many gaps still exist in our knowledge of upstream mechanisms
responsible for ROS generation by 4HPR.
ROS are produced from the reactions of unpaired electrons of
oxygen molecules from various intracellular sources such as the
mitochondrial electron transport chain and the NADPH oxidase
complex, a multicomponent electron transfer complex composed of
the membrane-bound cytochrome b558 (gp91phox and p22phox)
and the cytosolic components [p67phox, p47phox, p40phox, and
Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac)-1; ref. 24]. On
activation, the cytosolic components of the enzyme complex
translocate to the plasma membrane where they associate with
cytochrome b558 , forming an active NADPH oxidase (25, 26). Because
NADPH-mediated generation of ROS is involved in various apoptosis
signaling pathways (27–30), we hypothesized that it may be a target
through which 4HPR induces ROS generation and apoptosis.
In this study, we found that 4HPR activates the NADPH oxidase
regulatory subunit Rac, and that this activation results in excessive
ROS levels in cancer cells that lead to apoptosis induction
apparently by exceeding the endogenous antioxidant capacity.
Moreover, we found that 4HPR caused a higher activation of Rac in
metastatic cells compared with their corresponding primary
cancer cells, which correlated with increased ROS generation and
cell growth inhibition.

Rac Mediates ROS Induction by 4HPR

Materials and Methods
Retinoid and reagents. The synthetic retinoid 4HPR was obtained from
Dr. James A. Zwiebel (Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer
Institute, Bethesda, MD) and dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of
10 mmol/L and stored in dark containers at 80jC under N2 atmosphere.
Stock solutions were diluted to the final concentration with growth medium
just before use. DMSO, Krebs-Ringer buffer, tert-butyl hydroxyl anisole,
sulforhodamine B, and crystal violet were purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co. The Rac inhibitor NSC-23766 was obtained from Calbiochem.
Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was purchased from Molecular
Probes. The RacV12 expression vector was obtained from Dr. Kaikobad
Irani (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA).
Cell culture. The HNSCC cell lines UMSCC-22A and UMSCC-22B,
derived from pharyngeal primary tumors and lymph node metastasis,
respectively, and isolated originally from the same patient, were obtained
from Dr. Thomas Carey (University of Michigan, Ann Harbor, MI). The
primary and metastatic isogenic HNSCC cell line pair Tu167-C2 and DM14
was obtained from Dr. Jeffrey Myers (The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Murine melanoma B16-F1 and B16F10 cells were obtained from Dr. Isaiah Fidler (The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), and bronchioalveolar cancer H522
cells and squamous cervical cancer C33A cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture collection. The cells were grown and maintained in
monolayer culture in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F12 medium.
The medium was supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and the cells
were incubated at 37jC in an atmosphere consisting of humidified air with
5% CO2.
Treatment with 4HPR and the Rac inhibitor NSC-23766. The Rac
inhibitor NSC-23766 was prepared as a 50 mmol/L stock solution in distilled
water and stored at 80jC. Cells were seeded in 10-cm-diameter dishes for
Rac activation assays and Western blot analysis, and in 24-well plates for
assessment of ROS levels. After 24 h, cells were serum starved for 1 d in
serum-free medium or medium containing NSC-23766 at different doses
before treatment with 5 Amol/L 4HPR for different time points. The control
cells were treated with the same final concentration of DMSO as the
retinoid-treated cultures.
Measurement of intracellular ROS levels. Intracellular ROS levels were
measured with the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent dye DCFH-DA, with the
conversion of DCFH-DA to dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assessed as previously
described (31). Briefly, cells were electroporated with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) or expression vectors and/or seeded at a density of f8  104 per
well in 24-well plates. After 1 d, cells were washed twice with PBS and
incubated in either serum-free medium alone or in serum-free medium
containing NSC-23766 for Rac inhibition studies. The following day, the cells
were washed twice with prewarmed Krebs-Ringer buffer and then incubated
in the same buffer containing 10 Ag/mL DCFH-DA with DMSO alone, NSC23766, 4HPR, or both 4HPR and NSC-23766 at 37jC. The fluorescence
intensity of DCF was measured at an emission of 530 nm after excitation at
485 nm at 1-h intervals using a CytoFluor 2350 Fluorescence Measurement
System (Millipore). An increase in fluorescence intensity as arbitrary units
indicated the generation of net intracellular ROS. Each treatment was done
in four replicate wells and results were calculated, with error bars
representing SE.
Measurement of Annexin V–positive cells. Apoptotic cell death was
quantitatively measured by measuring externalized phosphatidylserine with
the Annexin V-FLOUS Staining Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were harvested at the indicated time points after
treatment and were washed twice with PBS before staining with and
incubation in 100 AL of prediluted Annexin V-FLOUS labeling agent for
15 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed once with
the manufacturer’s incubation buffer and finally resuspended in 400 mL of
the same buffer. Propidium iodide solution was added to the Annexin
V-FLOUS–labeled cells just before analysis with the BD Flow cytometer for
quantification of Annexin V–positive cells.
Cell growth inhibition assay. The cells were seeded at calculated
cellular densities that allow them to reach near-confluent states 24 h after

seeding, at which time the cells were incubated in serum-free medium
containing either DMSO or 4HPR. After 1 or 2 d of treatment, cell number
was estimated by the sulforhodamine B assay as previously described (32).
Briefly, after treatment of cells for the indicated time points, the media were
poured on the cells gently, then cells were fixed by adding 100 AL of cold
10% trichloroacetic acid ( from Sigma) and incubated for 60 min at 4jC.
Following fixation, the supernatants were discarded and plates were washed
five times with deionized water and then air-dried or stored in a warm
chamber until use. After drying, 50 AL of 0.4% (w/v) sulforhodamine B
solution in 1% acetic acid were added to each well, and the plates were then
incubated with the stain for 10 min at room temperature. Following
staining, plates were washed five times with 1% acetic acid and air-dried at
37jC, after which 100 AL of 10 mmol/L unbuffered Tris base (pH 10.5) were
added to each well to solubilize the dye. Plates were shaken for 5 min on a
titer plate shaker and optical densities were read on an automated
spectrophotometric plate reader at a wavelength of 510 nm. The error bars
represent the SE of four replicate measures.
Colony formation assay. Following transfection with RacV12, cells were
seeded in six-well plates at a seeding density of 5,000 per well. Ten days
later, the medium was decanted and cells were gently washed with PBS to
remove residual medium. Cells were then incubated with Carnoy’s fixative
(3 parts methanol to 1 part acetic acid) at room temperature for 10 min.
The cells were then gently washed with distilled water several times and
stained with crystal violet for 10 min. The cells were then washed with
distilled water several times, after which excess water was gently shaken off
and the plates were left to dry.
Western blot analysis. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold
PBS, harvested, and processed for immunoblotting as previously described
(12). The antibodies used for immunoblotting included antihuman Rac1 and
anti-myc tag (Upstate); HSP70/HSPA1A (Stressgen Bioreagents); poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), p21-activated kinase (PAK)-1, JNK, phosphoJNK, c-Jun, and phospho-Jun (Ser63) (Cell Signaling Technology); and h-actin
(Sigma Chemical Co.). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences Corp.). Equality of loading
and transfer (internal controls) were estimated by probing membranes with
h-actin or staining the blots with the protein stain Ponceau S.
Rac activation assay. To test for Rac activation by 4HPR, cells were
seeded at f106 cells in serum-containing medium in 10-cm dishes. The
next day, the cells were switched to serum-free medium and serum starved
for 48 h before treatment with 4HPR in serum-free medium for the
indicated time points. Samples were handled for the Rac activation assay
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cytoskeleton). Briefly, the
medium was decanted, dishes were washed with 5 mL of PBS at room
temperature, and 0.5 mL of the manufacturer’s ice cold lysis buffer was
added. Cells were scraped off the plates into lysis buffer and cell lysates
were clarified by centrifuging. Samples of the cell lysates were incubated
with 20 Ag of PAK-p21 binding domain (PBD) beads and 1 of the
manufacturer’s protease inhibitor cocktail in a total volume of 1 mL and
were incubated at 4jC on a rocker for 1 h. The beads were then pelleted by
centrifugation and washed thrice with the manufacturer’s 1 wash buffer,
after which they were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDSPAGE and Western blotting analysis. Membrane blots were incubated with
the manufacturer’s antibody raised against Rac and antibody binding was
detected as described before.
Transfection of cells with siRNA and plasmids. siRNAs against Rac1
and PAK1 were synthesized by a proprietary design as SMARTpool siRNA,
which consists of four pooled SMARTselection-designed siRNAs that are
21 nucleotides forming a 19-bp duplex core with symmetrical two
nucleotide 3¶-UU overhangs (Dharmacon, Inc.). Cells were electroporated
with the siRNAs and plasmids as previously described (23). Briefly, 1.2  106
cells were reconstituted in 100 AL of electroporation transfection solution or
Nucleofector Solution V from Cell Line Nucleofection Kit V (Amaxa
Biosystems). siCONTROL or siGenome SMARTpool siRNA against Rac1 and
PAK1 was added to the cells at a final concentration of 200 pmol per
sample, and the mixtures were transferred to electroporation cuvettes and
subjected to electroporation according to the manufacturer’s programs and
instructions. The electroporated and transfected cell suspensions were

immediately mixed with 500 AL of prewarmed RPMI medium supplemented
with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were then transferred to six-well
plates for Western blot analysis or to 24-well plates for measurement of ROS
levels containing prewarmed DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5%
FBS. Cells were incubated for 24 h, after which they were incubated in
serum-free medium for another 24 h before treatment with 4HPR. Cells
were also electroporated with the expression vector encoding the mutant
Rac, RacV12, and were subjected to analysis in the same manner as
described above following transfection with siRNAs.

Results
Activation of Rac in HNSCC cells by 4HPR. Treatment of
UMSCC-22B HNSCC cells with 4HPR increased the amount of GTPRac compared with control cells (Fig. 1A). This effect was inhibited
by pretreating the cells with NSC-23766, a Rac GTPase inhibitor that
targets Rac activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(Fig. 1A; ref. 33). These results indicate that Rac is activated by 4HPR.
Inhibition of 4HPR-induced apoptosis by suppression of Rac
expression or activity. 4HPR induced apoptosis in UMSCC-22B

cells as indicated by increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 1B) and
percentage of Annexin V–positive cells. This effect was suppressed
by inhibition of Rac with NSC-23766 (Fig. 1B). Because upregulation and phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK (21) and upregulation of HSPA1A/HSP70 (23) were found to be important for
apoptosis induction by 4HPR, we examined whether they are
affected by inhibition of Rac before exposure to 4HPR. Pretreatment of the cells with NSC-23766 decreased both phosphorylated
and total levels of c-Jun, as well as HSPA1A levels, profoundly
(Fig. 1B), suggesting that Rac is upstream of these changes.
Further support for this conclusion has come from targeting Rac1
expression by RNA interference, which diminished the level of Rac1
(Fig. 1C) and decreased 4HPR-induced up-regulation of HSPA1A
and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1D). These results showed that Rac
activation contributes to 4HPR-induced apoptosis and Rac is
upstream of JNK activation and HSPA1A induction.
Induction of ROS by 4HPR is downstream of Rac activation.
Our group has previously shown that 4HPR induces ROS increase,
which is abrogated by cotreatment of cells with the antioxidant

Figure 1. Apoptosis induction by 4HPR in HNSCC cells mediated by Rac activation. A, UMSCC-22B cells were seeded at 1  106 per dish in a series of 10-cm
dishes for 24 h. The cells were then incubated in serum-free medium for another 24 h before overnight pretreatment with the Rac inhibitor NSC-23766 (60 Amol/L).
The cells were then incubated for 5 min in medium containing either DMSO (control) or 5 Amol/L 4HPR, harvested, and then scraped into lysis buffer. The cell lysates
were processed for assessment of activated Rac (GTP-Rac) levels as described in Materials and Methods. Material adsorbed to PBD beads was analyzed by
immunoblotting with anti-GTP-Rac antibodies after SDS-PAGE and samples of the nonadsorbed material were also analyzed by immunoblotting for total Rac levels
and h-actin. B, cells seeded as in A were used for Rac inhibition by pretreating them with 60 Amol/L NSC-23766 overnight before incubation in medium containing
DMSO, 60 Amol/L NSC-23766, 5 Amol/L 4HPR alone, or a combination of both NSC-23766 and 4HPR for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and used to extract
total protein fraction. Samples of these extracts were subjected to immunoblotting analysis to assess PARP cleavage, HSPA1A levels, and total and phosphorylated
levels of c-Jun. Membrane blots were probed with h-actin and stained with the dye Ponceau S to assess for equality of protein loading in the different lanes.
Similarly treated cells were also subjected to analysis of Annexin V–positive cells as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of two duplicate
measurements; bars, SE. C, Western blot analysis depicting the effect of RNA interference on Rac1 protein levels. UMSCC-22B cells were transfected with

Samples of these extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Rac1 antibody. Membrane blots were stained with the dye Ponceau S to compare
protein loading in the different lanes. D, UMSCC-22B cells were transfected with siCONTROL and siRNA against Rac1, as described in Materials and Methods,
and then transferred to six-well plates. After 24 h, cells were maintained in serum-free medium for another 24 h before treatment with 5 Amol/L 4HPR. Total protein
lysates of these samples were prepared following 4HPR treatment and subjected to immunoblotting to assess PARP cleavage and HSPA1A levels. Membrane
blots were stained with Ponceau S to compare loading in the different lanes.

Rac Mediates ROS Induction by 4HPR

Figure 2. Induction of apoptosis by 4HPR involves sequential activation of
Rac, increase in ROS, and JNK activation. A, cells were seeded as in Fig.1A ,
and, 24 h after exposure to 4HPR in the presence or absence of tert -butyl
hydroxyl anisole (BHA ), were harvested and used to extract total protein fraction.
Samples of these extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting for PARP cleavage,
as well as total and phosphorylated levels of JNK. Membrane blots were
stained with the dye Ponceau S to assess for equality of protein loading in the
different lanes. B, UMSCC-22B cells were seeded at 1  106 per dish in a
series of 10-cm dishes for 24 h. The cells were then incubated in serum-free
medium for another 24 h. The cells were then incubated in medium containing
DMSO (control), 50 Amol/L BHA, 5 Amol/L 4HPR, or both 5 Amol/L 4HPR and
50 Amol/L BHA for 5 min, harvested, and then scraped into lysis buffer. The cell
lysates were processed for assessment of activated Rac or GTP-Rac levels
as described in Materials and Methods. Protein samples were also resolved on
SDS-PAGE before incubation with PBD beads for analysis
of total Rac levels.

tert-butyl hydroxyl anisole (13). tert-Butyl hydroxyl anisole suppressed 4HPR-induced JNK activation and PARP cleavage, indicating the importance of ROS in 4HPR-induced apoptosis and placing
JNK activation downstream of ROS (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ROS
scavenging by tert-butyl hydroxyl anisole failed to inhibit Rac
activation by 4HPR (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that in 4HPRtreated cells, Rac activation is upstream of ROS generation.
Suppression of ROS induction by 4HPR by the Rac inhibitor
NSC-23766. The findings that the Rac inhibitor NSC-23766
compromised the ability of 4HPR to induce apoptosis and that
ROS generation was required for 4HPR-induced apoptosis and
was downstream of Rac activation prompted us to examine the
possibility that Rac activation by 4HPR is important for ROS
generation. Pretreatment of cells overnight decreased ROS
generation by 4HPR in a Rac inhibitor dose–dependent manner
(Fig. 3A). A 4-hour pretreatment with NSC-23766 was also effective
albeit less than the longer pretreatment (data not shown). In
contrast, the Rac inhibitor (overnight pretreatment schedule) did
not decrease the high level of ROS measured in cells incubated with
0.1% hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3B), excluding the possibility that
NSC-23766 acts as an oxygen scavenger and leading to the
conclusion that Rac acts upstream of ROS generation. Similarly

to the effects in HNSCC UMSCC-22B cells, pretreatment with the
Rac inhibitor suppressed ROS induction by 4HPR in bronchioalveolar cancer H522 cells and cervical cancer C33A cells (Fig. 3C).
siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Rac1 or its downstream effector kinase PAK1 decreased 4HPR-induced ROS
generation. Targeting Rac1 expression with siRNA, which has been
shown to down-regulate Rac1 (Fig. 1C), suppressed the induction
of ROS generation by 4HPR in HNSCC cells (UMSCC-22B and
DM14) and bronchioalveolar cancer cells (H522) by f50%
(Fig. 4A). To determine whether the established Rac signaling
pathway is involved in ROS generation, we interfered with
expression of PAK1, the downstream effector kinase of Rac
signaling (34). Transfection of UMSCC-22B cells with siRNA
targeting PAK1 reduced PAK1 expression (Fig. 4B) and decreased
ROS generation by 4HPR in both UMSCC-22B and DM14 HNSCC
cells relative to cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 4C).
Expression of a constitutively active RacV12 increased ROS
generation and cell growth inhibition in HNSCC cells. Because
we have shown that activation of Rac by 4HPR is important for
ROS generation and apoptosis induction, we hypothesized that
expression of RacV12, a constitutively active mutant form of Rac,
will emulate the effects of 4HPR. The expression of RacV12 was
confirmed by the differential detection of the Myc tag by Western
blotting (Fig. 5B). RacV12 expression has led to a small increase in
ROS (Fig. 5A) and a modest but reproducible increase in PARP
cleavage (Fig. 5B). Moreover, RacV12 increased the sensitivity of
cells to 4HPR-induced ROS and apoptosis, evident in the increased
PARP cleavage in 4HPR-treated RacV12-expressing cells compared
with control plasmid–transfected treated cells (Fig. 5A and B). In
addition, expression of RacV12 inhibited colony formation by
HNSCC cells compared with cells that were either nontransfected
or transfected with a control plasmid (Fig. 5C and D).
4HPR induced higher levels of Rac activation, ROS, and cell
growth inhibition in metastatic cancer cells compared with
their primary cancer cell counterparts. Our finding that 4HPR
can induce apoptosis by activating Rac and increasing ROS in
cancer cells raised the question on whether metastatic cells are
partially resistant to 4HPR because they are known to have
elevated levels of both Rac and ROS, which are important for their
proliferation, growth, and migration (35–37). Therefore, we
compared and contrasted the effects of 4HPR on pairs of cell lines
derived from primary and metastatic cancers (UMSCC-22A and
UMSCC-22B, respectively) or selected in vivo for enhanced
metastasis from less metastatic cells (DM14/Tu167-C2 and B16
F10/F1). 4HPR induced higher Rac activation in the metastatic
DM14 HNSCC cancer cells relative to the primary cancer Tu167-C2
cells, evidenced by the increased Rac-GTP levels in DM14 cells
(Fig. 6A). Interestingly, 4HPR induced higher levels of ROS in DM14
and B16-F10 cells compared with their primary cancer cell
counterparts, Tu167-C2 and B16-F1 (Fig. 6B). ROS levels in all of
these cell lines were inhibited by cotreatment of cells with the Rac
inhibitor. The increase in ROS levels in 4HPR-treated cells
correlated with increased cell growth inhibition in the metastatic
cancer cells compared with their corresponding primary cancer
cells (Fig. 6C). The growth inhibitory effect of 4HPR was decreased
by cotreatment of cells with the Rac inhibitor NSC-23766 (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Several groups including our own have shown that 4HPR
generates ROS and that this effect is important for apoptosis

and then incubated in the same buffer containing 10 Ag/mL DCFH-DA with DMSO (control), 60 Amol/L NSC-23766, 0.1% hydrogen peroxide, or a combination of both
NSC-23766 and hydrogen peroxide. ROS levels were then assessed as indicated in A. C, HNSCC UMSCC-22B cells, bronchioalveolar cancer H522 cells, and

induction (12, 13). Various effects of 4HPR leading to apoptosis
seem to be downstream of ROS induction, including activation of
MAPKs (21). However, little is known about events or mechanisms
by which 4HPR increases ROS generation. Although activation of
the small GTPase Rac is often associated with cancer progression
(36, 37), it also functions as a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase
leading to ROS generation (24, 38) and has been implicated in
apoptosis induction (39). Therefore, we hypothesized that Rac plays
a role in 4HPR-induced ROS generation and subsequent apoptosis.
Indeed, in this study, we present for the first time evidence that
pinpoints to a novel role of Rac activation in 4HPR-induced ROS
generation and subsequent apoptosis. Different experimental
approaches provided this evidence. Chemical inhibition of the
function of Rac or siRNA-mediated silencing of its expression
resulted in decreased ROS generation. In addition, siRNA-mediated
targeting of the downstream Rac effector kinase PAK1 has led to a
decrease in ROS generation by 4HPR. All of these changes in Rac
were associated with modulation of 4HPR-induced apoptosis.
Furthermore, expression of the constitutively active Rac mutant
RacV12 alone inhibited the growth of human head and neck cancer
cells and sensitized them to 4HPR-induced ROS generation and
apoptosis.
The finding that ROS generated following Rac activation can
cause apoptosis, as shown in 4HPR-treated cells, is novel because
the previous studies implicating Rac in apoptosis induction by
bufalin and capsaicin did not explore the possible involvement of
Rac-mediated ROS generation in this effect (39, 40).
The JNK MAPK is involved in c-Jun phosphorylation and
activation as well as expression (41). In this study, we showed
that inhibition of Rac activation by cotreating cells with 4HPR and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (11). June 1, 2008

a Rac inhibitor abrogated both 4HPR-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and expression, supporting the conclusion that Rac is involved
in JNK activation. Interestingly, Rac has previously been shown to
selectively activate JNK as well as c-Jun transcriptional activity (41).
However, in this study, we also showed that ROS elevation in 4HPRtreated cells leads to sustained JNK activation and apoptosis
evidenced by PARP cleavage, both of which were abrogated
following scavenging of 4HPR-induced ROS by tert-butyl hydroxyl
anisole. Moreover, we have shown that this ROS increase by 4HPR
is downstream and dependent on Rac activation by 4HPR. These
findings indicate that ROS generation induced by Rac activation
mediates 4HPR-induced apoptosis and not other signaling
mechanisms possibly initiated by Rac activation alone.
In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of Rac activation by
4HPR, we targeted signaling pathways that have been shown to
activate Rac. For example, we inhibited epidermal growth factor
signaling with the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor EKB569 (42)
and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY129004 (43) and
found no change in ROS generation by 4HPR in UMSCC-22B
HNSCC cells (data not shown). Further studies are needed to
determine how 4HPR activates Rac.
It is has been shown that transformed cells exhibit higher basal
ROS levels compared with nontransformed cells. The higher ROS
level is thought to be essential for stimulation of cell growth and
sustenance of high metabolic rates in transformed cells (44).
Furthermore, metastatic cells also exhibit high levels of ROS
thought to be important for their growth and progression (37). In
addition, elevated ROS levels confer a growth advantage to cells by
activation of several mitogenic signaling pathways (45). We thought
it plausible that elevated ROS levels, although capable of inducing

apoptosis, can still instigate growth-promoting signals in the
metastatic UMSCC-22B HNSCC cells we used in this study. We
compared levels of ROS generation and cell growth inhibition by
4HPR in isogenic pairs of primary and metastatic cancer cells.
Interestingly, 4HPR led to increased ROS generation, which
correlated with increased cell growth inhibition in the metastatic
cancer cells compared with their corresponding primary cancer
cells. Moreover, Rac, which we also found in this report to be

important for ROS generation by 4HPR, was activated by 4HPR to
higher levels in the DM14 metastatic cancer cells compared with
their corresponding Tu167-C2 primary cancer cells. It is worthwhile
to note that in one report, h-phenylethyl isothiocyanate was shown
to selectively kill oncogenically transformed cells through a ROSdependent mechanism (46).
Rac plays crucial roles in migration and invasion, which are
important steps in the metastasis process of cancer cells to near or

described in Materials and Methods.
Cells were then transferred to 24-well

Figure 6. Increased ROS generation, Rac activation, and cell growth inhibition by 4HPR in metastatic cancer cells compared with their corresponding primary cancer
cells. A, Tu167-C2 and DM14 cells were equally seeded in 10-cm dishes. After 24 h, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for at least 24 h. At 5 min
after incubation of cells in medium containing either DMSO (control) or 5 Amol/L 4HPR, cells were harvested and scraped into lysis buffer and lysates were processed
for assessment of activated Rac or GTP-Rac levels as described in Materials and Methods. Protein samples were also resolved on SDS-PAGE before incubation
with PBD beads for analysis of total Rac levels. B, the metastatic cancer DM14 cells and murine melanoma B16-F10 and their corresponding primary cancer cells,
Tu167-C2 and B16-F1, were equally seeded in 24-well plates at the same time. After 24 h, the cells were switched to serum-free medium alone or containing 60 Amol/L
NSC-23766 and incubated overnight. ROS levels were then assessed as described in Materials and Methods. The metastatic cancer cells, UMSCC-22B, DM14,
and B16-F10, along with their corresponding primary cancer cells, UMSCC-22A, Tu167-C2, and B16-F1, respectively, were seeded in 96-well plates at a seeding
density of 104 per well for analysis of cell growth inhibition by 4HPR. After 24 h, cells were gently washed with PBS and switched to serum-free medium containing the
different indicated doses of 4HPR (C ) or 5 Amol/L 4HPR in the presence or absence of 60 Amol/L NSC-23766 (D ). After 48 h, cells were fixed and stained with
sulforhodamine B, and absorbance readings quantified. Columns, mean of four replicate measurements; bars, SE.

distant tissues and organs (35). Interestingly, Ferraro and
colleagues (47) have shown that endogenous ROS levels are higher
in the B16-F10 metastatic cells compared with the B16-F1 murine
melanoma cells due to increased Rac1 activation. Nonetheless, our
findings show that the activation of a protein involved in cancer
promotion, such as Rac, may still lead to cell death in conjunction
with 4HPR treatment because the metastatic cells showed an
augmented activation of Rac by 4HPR, which resulted in the
generation of higher ROS levels and enhanced apoptosis.
In conclusion, we have shown that Rac activation by 4HPR
precedes ROS generation and is required for cell death induction by
the proapoptotic 4HPR and that metastatic cancer cells exhibit
increased sensitivity to 4HPR because of higher Rac activation in
these cells compared with their primary isogenic cancer cell
counterparts. Moreover, our findings support the use of the ROS-
