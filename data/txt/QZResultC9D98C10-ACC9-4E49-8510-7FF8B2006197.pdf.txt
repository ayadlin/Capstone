Abstract
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are often highly enriched within the tumorinfiltrating T cell pool. Using a well-characterised model of carcinogen-induced
fibrosarcomas we show that the enriched tumor-infiltrating Treg population comprises
largely of CXCR3+ T-bet+ ‘TH1-like’ Tregs which are thymus-derived Helios+ cells.
Whilst IL-2 maintains homeostatic ratios of Tregs in lymphoid organs, we found that
the perturbation in Treg frequencies in tumors is IL-2 independent. Moreover, we
show that the TH1 phenotype of tumor-infiltrating Tregs is dispensable for their ability
to influence tumor progression. We did however find that unlike Tconvs, the majority
of intra-tumoral Tregs express the activation markers CD69, CD25, ICOS, CD103 and
CTLA4 and are significantly more proliferative than Tconvs. Moreover, we have found
that CD69+ Tregs are more suppressive than their CD69- counterparts. Collectively,
these data indicate superior activation of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment,
promoting their suppressive ability and selective proliferation at this site.

Introduction

Interleukin-2 (IL-2), secreted primarily by CD4+
Foxp3- T cells, plays a crucial role in maintaining immune
tolerance. Tregs do not produce IL-2 but constitutively
express CD25 (part of the high affinity IL-2 receptor),
suggesting they may have the ability to compete for the
IL-2 resource provided by other T cells. Indeed, under
homeostatic conditions, the frequency of Tregs in the
periphery is regulated by the number of IL-2 producing
T cells [8, 9]. The tightly controlled ratio of Tconv to
Treg under normal conditions is significantly perturbed
in the microenvironment of tumors in mice and humans,
where Tregs can represent up to 40-50% of the CD4+ T
cell pool [4, 5]. It is possible therefore that IL-2 is limited
in the tumor microenvironment and that the perturbation
in Tconv to Treg ratios reflects competition for limited
IL-2 at this site. There is also a growing consensus that
Tregs differentiate into distinct lineages optimised in their

CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) serve to
maintain immune homeostasis, prevent autoimmunity
and limit immunopathology [1]. It is also well known
from studies of mouse models and cancer patients, that
Tregs are enriched in tumors where they often facilitate
disease progression [2-5]. We have used a mouse model
of chemical carcinogenesis whereby fibrosarcomas are
induced in vivo following administration of the chemical
carcinogen, 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) to identify
factors promoting enrichment of intra-tumoral Tregs.
This model is useful and relevant as there is a highly
significant enrichment of Tregs within the fibrosarcomas,
and depletion of these Tregs results in T cell mediated
control of tumor progression [4, 6, 7].

ability to suppress specific Tconv subsets [10-13]. Thus,
the demonstration that T-bet+ CXCR3-expressing Tregs
accumulate in human ovarian cancer has lent support to
the theory that Tregs must ‘mirror’ the TH1-orientated antitumor response in order to effect immunosuppression [14].
In the study described herein we investigate
whether expression of T-bet and / or competition for
IL-2 is important for Treg-mediated suppression of
tumor immunity. We also explore potential drivers
of Treg accumulation in tumors, identifying superior
activation and proliferation of intra-tumoral Tregs as key
factors underpinning their ability to dominate this highly
immunosuppressed site.

(CD25, CD44, CD103, CTLA4, ICOS). Tregs within the
tumor demonstrated significantly higher expression levels
of all activation markers studied than Tconvs (Figure 1F).
These data confirm that Foxp3+ tTregs within the tumor are
not only significantly more proliferative but also exhibit a
more activated phenotype than Tconvs at this site.

Tumor-infiltrating Tconvs and Tregs are enriched
for inflammation-seeking “TH1-like” cells
TH1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses
limit progression of MCA-induced fibrosarcomas after
Treg depletion [4, 7, 19, 20]. Previous studies have
reported that Tregs can express the chemokine receptor
CXCR3 in response to TH1 polarising cues, and that
these CXCR3+ Tregs accumulate at peripheral sites
of inflammation to specifically suppress TH1 and CTL
responses [10, 11, 14, 21]. When we analysed tumorinfiltrating T cells for CXCR3 expression, a high
proportion (approximately 60%) of tumor-infiltrating
Tregs were CXCR3+ (Figure 2A-2B). Furthermore, the
majority of Ki67+ proliferating Tregs in the tumor coexpressed CXCR3, as was true for intra-tumoral Tconvs
(Figure 2A-2C). We also found T-bet expression in a
proportion of both intra-tumoral Tconv and Treg cells
(Figure 2D-2E).
It was hypothesised that if, as suggested in the
literature [10, 11], T-bet expression is necessary for the
ability of Tregs to suppress TH1 responses and promote
tumor growth, then tumor development should be better
controlled in the absence of T-bet expressing Tregs. We
used mice genetically engineered to lack T-bet expression
in Foxp3+ cells (T-betfl/flFoxp3-Cre conditional KO mice)
[22]. As CXCR3 expression is under the control of T-bet
in Treg cells, Treg in T-betfl/flFoxp3-Cre conditional KO
mice also display abolished CXCR3 expression [11, 22].
We confirmed the lack of CXCR3 expression in Foxp3+
Tregs at the protein level by flow cytometric analysis of
blood (Figure 2F). To test the hypothesis, we compared the
incidence of MCA-induced tumors in T-betfl/flFoxp3-Cre
conditional KO and WT C57BL/6 mice and found tumor
incidence was comparable between the groups (Figure
2G). Thus, whilst these data show that in MCA-induced
tumors, approximately 50% of tTregs are “TH1-like”, we
have no evidence that T-bet is required for Treg-mediated
suppression in the tumor environment. Moreover,
proportions of intra-tumoral Tregs were comparable in
T-betfl/flFoxp3-Cre conditional KO and WT mice (data not
shown).

Results
Intra-tumoral Foxp3+ Tregs proliferate more than
Foxp3- Tconvs
Tregs are highly enriched within the
microenvironment of MCA-induced tumors, reaching
40-50% of the CD4+ T cell pool [4, 7, 15]. To determine
why this should be the case, we initially measured the
proliferative status of Tconv and Treg within tumorbearing mice by Ki67 expression. Ki67 is a nuclear protein
expressed during all active phases of the cell cycle and
hence is used as a marker of cellular proliferation [16]. A
higher proportion of Tregs expressed Ki67 compared to
Tconv cells within all of the sites (spleen, lymph nodes
and tumor), in both tumor-bearing and naïve mice (Figure
1A-1B). Notably, by far the most significant difference
between the proportions of proliferating Tconv and Treg
cells was observed within the tumor (Figure 1C).

Highly proliferative tumor-infiltrating Foxp3+
Tregs are thymus-derived Helios+ T cells
TCR clonotypes are largely distinct between
Foxp3- and Foxp3+ CD4+ tumor-infiltrating T cell subpopulations, indicating that conversion does not account
for intra-tumoral Treg-enrichment and supporting the
hypothesis that Tregs within the tumor are thymus-derived
Tregs (tTregs) [17]. The Ikaros transcription factor family
member, Helios, is expressed predominantly in tTregs
[18]. As shown in Figure 1D and 1E, Helios staining was
observed mainly in the Foxp3+ population, and indeed, the
vast majority of proliferating Foxp3+ cells also express
Helios. These data confirm that the highly proliferative
Tregs in the tumor are thymus-derived Helios expressing
Tregs.
In order to assess the activation status of intratumoral Tregs, flow cytometric analysis of the expression
of a number of markers associated with T cell activation
were examined on both intra-tumoral Tregs and Tconvs

Competition for IL-2 does not account for the
enrichment of intra-tumoral Foxp3+ Tregs
We postulated that competition for IL-2 represents
a key component of intra-tumoral Treg proliferation and

subsequent enrichment. In line with this hypothesis, we
found that a lower proportion of intra-tumoral Tconv
expressed intra-cellular IL-2 compared to secondary
lymphoid organs (Figure 3A). To determine whether
provision of IL-2 would restore homeostatic ratios of
Tregs and Tconvs in the tumor, we injected tumor-bearing
mice with anti-IL-2/IL-2 complexes (S4B6-1-IL-2 which
binds CD122, stimulating both Tregs and Tconvs) [23]
which resulted in a significant increase in proliferation of

Tregs and Tconvs in lymphoid tissues but not the tumor
(Figure 3B). Accessibility of the S4B6-1-IL-2 complex
to the tumor mass was not an issue as the proportion of
Ki67+ proliferating CD8+ T cells in the tumor significantly
increased following complex administration (mean of
26.8% for non-treated versus mean of 74.6% for S4B61-IL-2 treated; ***P = 0.0010 by paired t test; data not

tumor draining and non-draining lymph nodes, were
more suppressive of Tconv proliferation than their CD69counterparts. We observed that CD69+ Tregs are 1.3 x
and 2 x more suppressive than CD69- Tregs at a Tconv
: Treg ratio of 8 : 1 in the NDLN and DLN, respectively.
Similarly, CD69+ Tregs are 1.3 x and 1.2 x more
suppressive than CD69- Tregs at a Tconv : Treg ratio of 4 :
1 in the NDLN and DLN, respectively (Figure 4E). These
data are indicative of a superior ability of CD69+ Foxp3+
Tregs to suppress proliferation of anti-tumor Tconv cells,
in relation to CD69- Foxp3+ Tregs.

favour of Tregs in secondary lymphoid tissues, the ratio
of Tconvs to Tregs in the tumor did not change (Figure
3C). These data indicate that IL-2 is not a limiting factor
for proliferation of Tregs or Tconvs in the tumor and that
increasing the availability of IL-2 has no impact on the
ratio of Tregs to Tconvs at this site.

CD69 is highly expressed on intra-tumoral Foxp3+
Tregs and denotes Tregs with superior suppressive
capacity
The data presented thus far indicate that the more
activated phenotype of intra-tumoral Tregs is linked to
superior proliferation and hence their enrichment within
the tumor-infiltrating T cell pool. To further address the
implications of superior Treg activation within the tumor
microenvironment we turned our attention to the early
activation marker, CD69 [24] as it has recently become
apparent that CD69, through reciprocal regulation of
sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1), retains CD69+
T cells at the site of antigen [25-27]. Moreover, CD69+
Foxp3+ Tregs are reportedly more efficient at limiting
inflammation than their CD69- counterparts [28], implying
that CD69 acts as a negative regulator of T cell activation.
We compared CD69 expression on MCA-tumorderived Foxp3- and Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells and found a
striking difference in that the proportion of Foxp3+ CD4+
T cells (mean of 35.4% ± 7.0 SEM) was at least double
that of Foxp3- CD4+ cells (mean of 13.1% ± 3.0 SEM)
(Figure 4A). The same pattern was observed when we
compared CD69 expression on Tregs and Tconvs isolated
from tumors of the 4T1 breast carcinoma model. These
data corroborated our findings in the MCA tumor model,
as again a significantly higher proportion of tumor
derived Foxp3+ Tregs expressed CD69 (mean of 37.1%
± 9.3 SEM) relative to tumor derived Foxp3- Tconv
(mean of 13.9% ± 2.3 SEM) (Figure 4A). These highly
significant differences in CD69 expression between Tregs
and Tconvs within both types of tumor is most striking
when analysed by Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI)
measurement (Figure 4B-4C). The significant enrichment
of CD69-expressing Tregs in both MCA and 4T1 tumor
models is presented using pie charts displaying relative coexpression of markers Helios, Ki67 and CD69 in Figure
4D.
	 We next sought to compare the suppressive
capacity of CD69+ and CD69- Tregs. CD4+ CD25lo Tconvs
were sorted from lymphoid tissue and co-cultured in the
presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads with either
CD69+ or CD69- Tregs sorted from tumor draining or
non tumor draining lymph nodes, at varying Tconv : Treg
ratios. Treg were sorted as CD4+ CD25hi CD127lo (CD69+
or CD69-) cells. After 120 hours of culture, proliferation
of labelled Tconvs was measured by flow cytometry
(Figure 4E). Strikingly, CD69+ Tregs, recovered from

Discussion
The observation that Tregs are enriched in tumors
has been made using numerous mouse models and through
the study of cancer patients [2-5]. The aim of this study
was to investigate the mechanism of this enrichment,
employing a carcinogen-induced tumor model to examine
Treg phenotype with respect to their intra-tumoral
accumulation and suppressive function.
A side-by-side analysis of the proliferation and
survival characteristics of intra-tumoral Tregs and
Tconvs revealed significant differences between the
two T cell populations. The proportion of Ki67+ Tregs
was significantly higher than Tconvs in spleens and
lymph nodes, corroborating previous observations [29].
However, the novel data presented herein indicate that
the extent of this difference is most striking in T cells
recovered from the tumor mass. Enhanced proliferation
was not accompanied by greater cell death within the Treg
population (data not shown) thus superior proliferation
of Tregs must contribute to their enrichment within the
tumor. Preferential proliferation and accumulation of Tregs
in the tumors does not reflect increased competition for
IL-2, as increasing the availability of IL-2 has no impact
on the ratio of Tregs to Tconvs at this site. These findings
also indicate that Tconvs are not held in check through
competition for IL-2. Whilst increasing the availability
of IL-2 had no impact on proliferation of intra-tumoral
Tregs or Tconvs, a significant increase in proliferation
of CD8+ T cells was observed. Whilst the reason for this
disparity is unclear, it is possible that intratumoral CD4+
T cells (unlike CD8+ T cells at the same site) are highly
differentiated, and hence no longer proliferate in response
to IL-2.
The proliferating Tregs in tumors expressed
both CXCR3 and T-bet, in keeping with a “TH1-like”
lineage, and Helios, a marker thought to define thymusderived Tregs. We have no evidence however that T-bet
expression defines Tregs with a superior capacity to
suppress anti-tumor immune responses, which in the case
of the MCA-induced fibrosarcomas described herein is
a TH1-orientated response [6, 19, 20]. These data are in
contrast to the previous observations made by Koch and
colleagues, where T-bet deficient Tregs were inferior to

site of antigen recognition [25-27]. Thus, in the case of
the tumors described herein, the consequence of CD69
expression on Tregs may be the retention of tumorinfiltrating super-suppressors thereby ensuring Treg
dominance within the tumor microenvironment.
In conclusion, we have eliminated competition for a
limited IL-2 resource as a means by which Tregs become
significantly enriched in tumors. Despite the discovery
of an accumulation of TH1-like Tregs in tumors, this
feature did not contribute to the functional ability of Tregs
to control anti-tumor immune responses. Instead, our
observations highlight increased proliferation of highly
suppressive CD69+ Tregs as a mechanism by which Tregs
exert dominance within the tumor microenvironment.

wild-type Tregs during control of TH1-mediated multiorgan autoimmunity [11]. However, several studies have
reported either no alteration in suppressive capacity
of Tregs when T-bet is absent [30, 31] or even superior
suppressive function of T-bet deficient Tregs [32]. A recent
study using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) reported that lack of T-bet expression in Foxp3+
Tregs did not hinder their infiltration of the inflamed
central nervous system, which is important for EAE
resolution. T-bet deficient Tregs were also capable of
preventing the development of T cell-driven colitis
[22]. These data together with our own tumor-related
data question the relevance of peripheral differentiation
of Tregs as a means of steering their function towards
selective inhibition of a particular type of immune
response. It is possible that expression of T-bet, and indeed
other master transcription factors, by Tregs could simply
be a reflection of chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory,
activating signals in certain disease settings, rather than a
requirement for specific functionality.
This study also examined a role for CD69, a C-type
lectin, upregulated on T cells upon antigen stimulation
[24]. Paradoxically, CD69-/- mice exhibit enhanced tumor
immunity and enhanced susceptibility to autoimmune
disease raising the possibility that the molecule is a
negative regulator of T cell activation [33, 34]. It is
possible that this effect of CD69 is mediated by Foxp3+
Tregs, as CD69+ Foxp3+ Tregs have been shown to limit
inflammation more efficiently than CD69- Tregs [28].
This effect of CD69 may relate to reciprocal regulation
of CD69 and S1P1 signalling [25-27]. As S1P1 signalling
upregulates the Akt-mTOR pathway, resulting in
diminished suppressor activity in Tregs [35], it follows
that CD69+ Treg would exhibit increased suppressor
activity. Our findings support this premise. It has also
become apparent that CD69 plays a role in retaining T
cells at the site of antigen, through preventing expression
of S1P1, thereby stopping lymphocyte egress from the

tumor development weekly for up to 2 months and daily
thereafter. Tumor-bearing mice were culled when their
tumors were between 1cm and 2cm in diameter, typically
100-150 days after MCA injection.

Intracellular antigen and cytokine staining

Administration of Anti-IL-2 / IL-2 complexes

For intracellular cytokine analysis, single cell
suspensions (0.5-1 million cells per well) were stimulated
in 24 well plates with complete RPMI containing 20 nM
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) and 1μg/
ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), at 37°C for 4 hours. After
1 hour of incubation, 1μl/ml of GolgiStop (containing
monensin; BD Biosciences) was added to each well.
Surface stained cells were stained for intracellular antigen
following Fixation/Permeabilisation (Foxp3-staining
kit, eBiosciences). Intracellular antibodies consisted of
anti-Ki67-FITC (B56; BD Bioscience) or anti-Ki67BrilliantViolet 421 (16A8; BioLegend), anti-IL-2-PE
(JES6-5H4; eBioscience), anti-Foxp3-PE-Cy7 (FJK-16s;
eBioscience), and anti-T-bet-PerCPCy5.5 (eBio4B10;
eBioscience). For flow cytometric analysis, samples
were acquired on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences), and were subsequently analysed using
FlowJo software.

For treatment with Anti-IL-2/IL-2 complexes,
5μg rIL-2 (PeproTech) was incubated with 50μg of antiIL-2 mAb (S4B6-1; Bio-Xcell) for 10 minutes at room
temperature, prior to injection. Following development
of a palpable tumor, complexes were administered by
intraperitoneal injection in 200μl of solution every day for
three consecutive days before sacrifice.

Preparation of single cell suspensions for antibody
staining and flow cytometry
Single cell suspensions of spleen, and inguinal
lymph nodes (LN) were prepared by homogenising tissues
in multiwell plates using the back of a syringe plunger.
The inguinal LN from the tumor (left) side of the mouse
was taken as the tumor draining LN and the contralateral
inguinal LN was considered to be a non-draining LN.
Dissected tumors were initially diced into a pulp using
a scalpel before homogenisation. Homogenised tissues
were resuspended in complete RPMI (RPMI [Invitrogen]
supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium
pyruvate, 50μg/ml penicillin streptomycin and 10% foetal
calf serum) and filtered through 70μM cell strainers (BD
Biosciences). Single cell suspensions were centrifuged
at approximately 450g for 5 minutes and cell pellets
were resuspended in FACS buffer (phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) containing 5mM EDTA and 2% foetal calf
serum). Prior to staining, spleen and tumor cell pellets
were subjected to red blood cell lysis by resuspending cell
pellets in 5ml RBC Lysis buffer (1/10 dilution in dH2O;
BioLegend) for 90 seconds at room temperature.

In vitro Treg suppression assay
Single cell suspensions were stained as detailed
above, using Live/Dead Aqua, anti-CD3-PECy5 (17A2;
BD Biosciences), anti-CD4-APC-eFluor 780 (RM4-5;
eBioscience), anti-CD25-PE (PC61; BD Biosciences),
and anti-CD127-BrilliantViolet605 (A7R34; BioLegend)
monoclonal antibodies. CD3+ CD4+ CD25lo Tconvs were
sorted from spleen, and CD3+ CD4+ CD25hi CD127lo
CD69+ Tregs and CD3+ CD4+ CD25hi CD127lo CD69Tregs were sorted from either non-tumor draining lymph
nodes or tumor-draining lymph nodes using a customized
20-parameter FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD). Too few
Tregs were isolated from pooled tumor samples to perform
reliable assays. Post-sort purity checks on practice cell
sorts revealed greater than 98% purity.
Sorted Tconvs were stained with CellTrace Violet
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers’
specifications, pelleted and resuspended in warm complete
RPMI at a concentration of 2.8 x 105 cells per ml, so as to
deliver 14, 000 effector cells in 50μl.

Cell surface staining
Single cell suspensions were plated in 96 roundbottomed well plates at 0.5-1 million cells per well. Cells
were washed twice in PBS prior to live/dead staining by
adding 3μl (or 6μl for tumor cell pellets) of LIVE/DEAD
Aqua (diluted 1:10 in PBS; Invitrogen) for 15 minutes in

Sorted Tregs were washed and resuspended
in warm complete RPMI culture medium (complete
RPMI supplemented with β-Mercaptoethanol, MEM
NEAA (100X; gibco) and 5mM HEPES buffer solution
(gibco)). 14, 000 Tconvs per well were incubated with
anti-mouse CD3/CD28 dynabeads (Invitrogen) at a ratio
of 1:2 (beads:Tconvs), with titrating numbers of Tregs,
in complete RPMI culture medium for 120 hours. After
72 hours, 100μl of fresh, warm complete RPMI culture
medium was added. Following culture, cells were stained
with Live/Dead Aqua, anti-CD3-PE-Cy5, anti-CD4-APC
eFluor 780 and anti-CD25-PE, as detailed above. Dilution
of CellTrace Violet was measured on a FACS Canto II
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). CD25hi, CellTrace
Violet negative Tregs were excluded from analysis.
