Abstract
We carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using a BRCA1 bait composed of amino acids 1 to 1142 and identified BRD7 as a novel binding partner of BRCA1. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of
endogenous BRCA1 and BRD7 in T47D and HEK-293 cells. BRD7 is a bromodomain containing protein, which
is a subunit of PBAF-specific Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complexes. To determine the functional consequences of the BRCA1-BRD7 interaction, we investigated the role of BRD7 in BRCA1-dependent transcription
using microarray-based expression profiling. We found that a variety of targets were coordinately regulated by
BRCA1 and BRD7, such as estrogen receptor α (ERα). Depletion of BRD7 or BRCA1 in either T47D or MCF7
cells resulted in loss of expression of ERα at both the mRNA and protein level, and this loss of ERα was
reflected in resistance to the antiestrogen drug fulvestrant. We show that BRD7 is present, along with BRCA1
and Oct-1, on the ESR1 promoter (the gene which encodes ERα). Depletion of BRD7 prevented the recruitment
of BRCA1 and Oct-1 to the ESR1 promoter; however, it had no effect on the recruitment of the other Swi/Snf
subunits BRG1, BAF155, and BAF57 or on RNA polymerase II recruitment. These results support a model
whereby the regulation of ERα transcription by BRD7 is mediated by its recruitment of BRCA1 and Oct-1
to the ESR1 promoter. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2538–47. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Germ line mutations within BRCA1 confer a genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 has been
implicated in diverse functions, in particular DNA damage
repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, ubiquitination, and transcriptional regulation (1). BRCA1 has been shown to associate with a variety proteins, and work to date supports a
model whereby BRCA1 acts as a scaffolding protein mediating the assembly of signaling complexes crucial for these assorted functions.
A role for BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation is now well
established, with a variety of activated and repressed transcriptional targets having been identified. These include
proteins involved in DNA repair, such as DDB2 and XPC
(2); cell cycle regulators, such as p21 and GADD45 (3);
and regulators of growth, such as 2,5 oligoadenylate synthetase (4) and psoriasen (5). Approximately 90% of BRCA1linked tumors are estrogen receptor α (ERα) negative. We
recently showed that BRCA1, along with the transcription
factor Oct-1, could activate the transcription of ERα, thus

providing one possible mechanism for the ERα-negative status of BRCA1 tumors (6). Transcription is a complex multistep process, and BRCA1 seems to work at several levels, as
determined by its interaction with proteins, which act at different stages. BRCA1 has been shown to associate, via RNA
helicase, with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), a component of
the core transcriptional complex. It also associates with a
variety of sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, such as p53, Myc, signal transducers and activators of
transcription 1 (STAT1), and Oct-1 (7). To facilitate transcription the structure of chromatin must be altered so as
to allow access of the transcriptional machinery to the DNA.
This is achieved both by modification of the tail of histones,
as well as by chromatin remodeling, via multisubunit enzyme complexes, such as the Swi/Snf complex, which hydrolyses ATP to alter the interactions between histones and
DNA. BRCA1 has been shown to associate with the histone
acetyltransferases p300/CBP and hGCN5/TRRAP, as well as
the histone deacetyases HDAC1 and HDAC2 (7). In addition
BRCA1 was shown to interact directly with BRG1, the
ATPase subunit of the Swi/Snf complex (8).
Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complexes are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and have been shown
to both positively and negatively regulate transcription. Human cells contain two major classes of the Swi/Snf complex,
BAF (BRG1 or hBRM-associated factor) and PBAF (polybromo-associated BAF). Each subgroup contains one of two
highly homologous ATPases, BRG1 or BRM, and a variable
number of associated subunits termed BRG1-associated factors (BAF). BAF complexes can contain either BRG1 or BRM,

whereas PBAF complexes contain only BRG1. The core subunits shared by most Swi/Snf complexes include the BAFs
170, 155, 60, 57, 53, 47, and actin (9). The subclasses are defined by the presence of specific signature subunits. BAF
complexes are specified by the ARID1 (BAF250) subunit,
whereas the signature subunits of PBAF complexes are ARID2,
polybromo (BAF180), and BRD7, a bromodomain containing
protein (10).
In this study we identify BRD7 as a novel binding partner
of BRCA1 and functionally characterize their interaction.

Materials and Methods
Yeast two-hybrid screen. Yeast two-hybrid screening was
carried out with the Clontech Matchmaker two-hybrid system (Takara Bio Europe) using an ovarian cDNA library
cloned in frame with the GAL4 activation domain in the
pACT2 vector. A bait construct composed of 1 to 3426 bp
(amino acids 1–1142) of BRCA1, was subcloned in frame with
the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBKT7 to generate
pGBKT7BRCA 1 to 1142. Two further constructs were generated in pGBKT7 composed of 1 to 2781 bp (amino acids 1–
927) and 907 to 2781 bp (amino acids 303–927) of BRCA1. For
the screen the pGBKT7BRCA 1 to 1142 was transformed into
the AH109 yeast strain and mated for 24 h at 30°C with Y187
yeast transformed with pACT-ovarian library. Interacting
clones were selected by their ability to activate the His3 reporter as indicated by growth on histidine/leucine/tryptophan (HLT)–negative media. Autoactivation of the His3
reporter by the pGBKT7BRCA 1 to 1142 construct was
prevented by the addition of 4 mmol/L 3-amino-triazole
(Sigma). Primary clones, which activated the His3 reporter,
were further tested for their ability to activate the ADE2
and lacZ reporters, as shown by growth on histidine/
adenine/leucine/tryptophan–negative media or conversion
of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (Sigma)
to a blue product, respectively.
Cell lines. All cell lines used were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and have been passaged for <6
mo since receipt.
Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Coimmunoprecipitations of BRCA1, BRD7, and Myc were carried out
from nuclear extracts of HEK-293 and T47D breast cells. For
coimmunoprecipitation 500 μg of nuclear extract were made
up to 250 μL with immunoprecipitation buffer (100 mmol/L
KCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L HEPES,
10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1% NP40, protease inhibitor
mix). For immunoprecipitation, 3 μg of the following antibodies were used: BRCA1, Ab-1, and Ab-4 (Calbiochem); antiBRD7 (ProteinTech Group); c-Myc, C-19, or C-8 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); and isotype-matched controls, IgG1, IgG2A,
and rabbit IgG (DAKO). The samples were incubated overnight at 4°C, then 50 μL of 50% protein A/G sepharose beads
(Sigma) in immunoprecipitation buffer were added, and incubation continued for another 2 h. The pellet was washed
4× in immunoprecipitation buffer. The samples were Western blotted for BRCA1, BRD7, or c-Myc.

Short interfering RNA transfection. Short interfering
RNA (siRNA) transfection of T47D or MCF cells was carried out as previously described (6). The siRNA sequences
used were the same except for the following: BRCA1 number-1, ACCATACAGCTTCATAAATAA; BRD7 number-1,
GUGCCAAGAUUAUCCGUAUUU; BRD7 number-2, CGCUGAAAGCAGUAACAAATT; Scrambled siRNA, AGCAGCACGACTTCTTCAAG.
Gene expression profiling and microarray data analysis.
RNA was harvested from T47D cells transfected in triplicate
independent transfections with BRD7 siRNA number-2,
BRCA1 siRNA (6), or SCR sequence. This was prepared and
hybridized to a Breast Cancer DSA microarray (6). The
criteria used to detect differential gene expression between
BRCA1- or BRD7-depleted and SCR-treated cells was a 1.3fold difference in gene expression at a statistical significance defined by a P value of ≤0.01 using the Student's unpaired t test.
Western blotting. Nuclear extract (60 μg) was resolved by
SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for BRD7 (ProteinTech), ERα
(HC-20), BRCA1 (D9), Oct-1 (C-21), BAF155 (F-2), BAF57 (C20), c-Myc (9E10; all six are from Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
and BRG1 (Millipore). Membranes were reprobed for actin
(Sigma, AC-74) to show equal loading.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cells using
RNA STAT60 reagent (Tel-Test, Inc.). RNA was generated
from three independent transfections, using two different
siRNA sequences for BRCA1 and BRD7. RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA
was subjected to quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCR (qRT-PCR) using Roche Lightcycler 480 SYBR
Green 1 master mix, according to the manufacturer's instructions, on a Roche Lightcycler 480 machine. Real-time primers
were designed using the Roche Universal Probe library,1 and
the primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Materials
and Methods. The levels of mRNA for each gene were normalized relative to actin mRNA. Statistical significance was
determined using the Student's unpaired two-tailed t test.
Gene transfection. Constructs encoding either BRD7 or
ΔBRD7 deleted in residues encoding the bromodomain
of BRD7 (amino acids 129–237) were obtained from Dr J.
Kzhyshkowska (11). These were transfected into T47D cells
using GeneJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Cells were harvested for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, or protein extracts 48 hrs after
transfection.
ChIP assay. ChIP assays were performed as previously described (6). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation
were anti-Pol II (CTD4H8, Millipore); anti-BRCA1, Ab-1, or
D9; anti-BRD7 (AbCam); anti-acetylhistone H3 and antiBRG1 (Millipore); anti-Oct1, anti-BAF57, anti-BAF155 (all
three from Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and rabbit IgG
and IgG1 (DAKO). The ESR1 promoter was amplified by

PCR using primers previously described (6) or with ESR1 control primers located ∼3 kb upstream of the promoter that amplified a 146-bp product [5′CACTGCAATACTGGGGGTCT
(forward) and 5′CCCTGGGACACTATGCAGTT (reverse)].
Antiestrogen sensitivity studies. T47D, MCF7, or BT-474
cells were transfected with either BRCA1, BRD7, ERα, or
SCR siRNA at a concentration of 200 nmol/L for two consecutive days using oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. On day 3, the cells were plated onto
96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. At 24 h later,
the cells were treated with fulvestrant (ICI 182,780; Tocris
Bioscience) at concentrations varying from 10−4 to 10−12
mol/L. After 72 h the number of viable cells was quantitated
using the MTT assay. The concentration of drug that inhibited 40% of the growth of the cells (IC40) was calculated with
prism software.

Results
Identification of BRD7 as a BRCA1-interacting protein.
Given that the biology of BRCA1 seems to be in large part
dictated by its interactions with other proteins, we carried
out a yeast two-hybrid screen using the NH2 terminal 1142
amino acids of BRCA1 to identify novel interactors. A human ovarian cDNA library was screened, and 154 clones
were isolated, using activation of the HIS3 reporter gene
as a read out of interaction. These clones were subjected
to further screening, which examined their ability to activate two additional reporter genes, LacZ and ADE2. Subsequent to this second round of screening, seven library
clones were identified as encoding BRCA1 interacting proteins. Of these seven clones, two encoded the known
BRCA1 interacting proteins BARD1 and cMyc. A third
clone contained sequence encoding amino acids 277 to
652 of BRD7, a bromodomain containing protein.
To further elucidate the site of interaction of BRD7 with
BRCA1, Y187 yeast expressing the BRD7 clone was mated
with AH109 yeast expressing either the BRCA1 bait 1 to
1142 or two further constructs encoding amino acids 1 to
927 of BRCA1 or 303 to 927 of BRCA1 (Fig. 1A). The BRD7
clone was unable to interact with 303 to 927 BRCA1 but
was still able to interact with 1 to 927BRCA1, as shown by
growth on HLT− media (Fig. 1B). The 303 to 927 BRCA1 construct expressed a functional protein as shown by its ability
to interact with the cMyc clone (data not shown). This indicates that the first 300 amino acids of BRCA1 are important
in mediating the interaction with BRD7.
BRCA1 and BRD7 interact in vivo. To determine whether
BRCA1 and BRD7 interact in vivo, coimmunoprecipitation
experiments were carried out in HEK-293 and T47D breast
cells. The previously characterized interaction of BRCA1 with
c-Myc was used as a positive control. BRCA1 was clearly present in the BRD7 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1C, left, lane 4) to an
even greater degree than that associating with c-Myc (lane 3),
indicating an association between endogenous BRCA1 and
BRD7. When the reciprocal BRCA1 immunoprecipitation
was carried out using two different BRCA1-specific monoclo-

2540

Cancer Res; 70(6) March 15, 2010

nal antibodies Ab-1 and Ab-4, again BRD7 was clearly present
(Fig. 1C, right, lanes and 3 and 4). The same immunoprecipitations carried out in T47D cells again clearly showed an
association of BRCA1 and BRD7 when immunoprecipitated
in either direction (Fig. 1D).
BRCA1 and BRD7 cooperate in transcriptional regulation. BRD7 is a bromodomain containing protein, which
has been identified as a PBAF-specific Swi/Snf subunit (10).
To determine the functional consequences of the BRCA1BRD7 interaction, we investigated the role of BRD7 in
BRCA1-dependent transcription using microarray-based expression profiling. The gene expression profile of either
BRCA1 or BRD7 depleted cells was compared with that of
SCR-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). A total of 1,928 genes exhibited BRCA1-dependent changes in expression relative to control; of these 1,172 were positively regulated and 756 were
negatively regulated. A total of 5,248 genes exhibited BRD7dependent expression changes compared with control; of
these 2,236 were positively regulated and 3,012 were negatively regulated by BRD7. The list of genes displaying
BRCA1-dependent changes in gene expression were compared with those showing BRD7-dependent regulation. From
this analysis 583 genes were determined to be jointly regulated by BRCA1 and BRD7, revealing that 30% of all BRCA1regulated genes were also jointly regulated by BRD7 and 11%
of BRD7-regulated genes were also regulated by BRCA1. Of
the 583 genes, 331 (57%) were positively regulated by BRCA1
and BRD7, and 252 (43%) were negatively regulated by both.
This agrees with previous studies, which show that BRCA1
and the Swi/Snf complex are able to both positively and negatively regulate transcription.
We further validated the expression of four of these targets, ERα, Rad51, versican, and CYP1A1, using qRT-PCR.
The expression of ERα, Rad51, and versican was decreased
to a similar degree in both BRCA1- and BRD7-depleted
T47D or MCF7 cells, indicating that both BRCA1 and BRD7
mediate the transcriptional activation of these three targets
(Fig. 3). We have previously shown that ERα is a BRCA1-regulated target (6). The expression of CYP1A1 was substantially
upregulated in both MCF7 and T47D cells in the absence of
either BRCA1 or BRD7, indicating that it is normally repressed by both.
BRD7 recruits BRCA1 and Oct-1 to the ESR1 promoter.
We have previously shown that BRCA1 and Oct-1 are present
on the ESR1 promoter (6). ChIP analysis showed that along
with BRCA1 (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 4 and 6) and Oct1 (lane 10),
BRD7 was clearly present on the ESR1 promoter (lane 8). The
association of BRD7 with the ESR1 promoter correlated with
the levels of acetylated histone H3 (lane 9). In addition as expected for an actively transcribed gene RNA Pol II was also
present on the promoter (lane 3).
We next examined if recruitment of either BRCA1 or BRD7
to the promoter was affected by the presence of their partner
protein. Depletion of BRD7 clearly inhibited the recruitment
of BRCA1 to the ESR1 promoter; however, the reciprocal depletion of BRCA1 had no effect on the recruitment of BRD7
to the promoter (Fig. 4B, left). Depletion of BRD7 also prevented the recruitment of the transcription factor Oct-1 to

presence of both plasmids, or on
HLT− media (+ 3AT). Growth of
the diploid yeast on HLT− media
(+3AT) indicates activation of the
HIS3 reporter gene, which
occurs upon protein interaction.
C, nuclear extracts were prepared
from HEK-293 cells and
immunoprecipitated for either
BRD7, c-Myc (C-19), or rabbit
IgG (left); or BRCA1 (Ab-1 and

the ESR1 promoter. Depletion of BRD7 had no effect on the
recruitment of Pol II to the promoter. We also examined the
effect of Oct-1 depletion on recruitment of BRD7 to the ESR1
promoter (Fig. 4B, right). Oct-1 depletion prevented the recruitment of BRCA1 to the promoter, as we had shown previously. However Oct-1 depletion had no effect on the
recruitment of BRD7 to the ESR1 promoter. In summary
these ChIP assays reveal that BRD7 is responsible for the recruitment of both BRCA1 and Oct-1 to the ESR1 promoter;
however, the recruitment of Pol II is unaffected.
Brd7 is a subunit of PBAF Swi/Snf complexes, which are
multisubunit complexes composed of three signature subunits, a number of core BAF subunits, and the ATPase BRG1.
Brd7 is one of the signature subunits of PBAF complexes.
BRCA1 has previously been shown to bind to BRG1 (8). To
ensure that BRD7 depletion was not affecting the assembly

of the Swi/Snf complex, we examined the recruitment of
BRG1, as well as the core subunits BAF 57 and BAF 155 to
the ESR1 promoter. All three Swi/Snf subunits were recruited
to the ESR1 promoter irrespective of the presence of BRD7
(Fig. 4C, lanes 7, 8, and 9), indicating that the assembly
and recruitment of the complex was unaffected by the absence of BRD7. In addition this result shows that despite
the presence of BRG1 on the ESR1 promoter, it is unable
to recruit BRCA1.
To determine if the bromodomain of BRD7 was important
for enabling the recruitment of BRD7 to the ESR1 promoter,
either full-length BRD7 or ΔBRD7 deleted in amino acids 129
to 236, which encode the bromodomain (11), were expressed
in T47D cells (Fig. 4D). ChIP analysis of T47D cells expressing
either construct revealed that there was a reduced level of
recruitment of ΔBRD7 to the promoter compared with

full-length BRD7 (Fig. 4D, compare lanes and 7 and 8). This
reduced recruitment of ΔBRD7 clearly correlated with reduced levels of recruitment of BRCA1 to the ESR1 promoter
(compare lanes 5 and 6); however, the recruitment of Pol II
was unaffected.
Association between BRD7 and response to antiestrogen
treatment. We have shown that the transcription of ERα is
coordinately regulated by BRD7 and BRCA1; thus we wanted
to confirm that this regulation was reflected in the level of
ERα protein expression. Depletion of either BRCA1 or
BRD7 led to a reduction in the level of ERα protein in either
T47D, MCF7, or BT474 cells (Fig. 5). We had previously
shown that this reduction in ERα protein levels, produced
by depletion of BRCA1, was able to mediate resistance to
the antiproliferative effects of the antiestrogen fulvestrant
(6). We examined whether the reduction in ERα levels produced by depletion of BRD7 produced a similar resistance to
fulvestrant. Depletion of ERα with siRNA was used as a positive control. In comparison to scrambled control-treated
cells, depletion of either BRCA1 or BRD7 led to a significant
resistance to the antiproliferative effects of fulvestrant in all
three cell types, similar to that produced by depletion of ERα.

Discussion
In this study we have identified BRD7, a subunit of PBAFspecific Swi/Snf complexes, as a novel binding partner of
BRCA1. We further show that BRD7 is responsible for the
recruitment of BRCA1 and Oct-1 onto the ESR1 promoter.
Finally we highlight the functional significance of the observation by showing that depletion of BRCA1 or BRD7 resulted
in loss of ERα expression and resistance to fulvestrant.
We show by microarray-based expression profiling that
BRD7, like BRCA1, can both repress and activate gene expression. Our results suggest that BRD7 may be involved in
the regulation of up to 30% of BRCA1 regulated genes. In
contrast BRCA1 was shown to coregulate only 11% of
BRD7 transcriptional targets as defined by microarray
analysis. This is not surprising as BRD7 is a member of
the PBAF Swi/Snf complex and likely to play a much wider
role than BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation. BAF and
PBAF Swi/Snf complexes have been shown to regulate expression of distinct genes (12). As the PBAF and BAF complexes share a set of core subunits, it is likely that the
functional specificity of the two subclasses is dictated by

BRCA1, BRD7 is also able to recruit the transcription factor Oct-1 to the ESR1 promoter. A previous study showed

that BRD7 could also bind the transcription factor IRF2

BRD7, or SCR control (left) or BRD7, Oct-1, or SCR control (right). At 72 h posttransfection either chromatin or nuclear extracts were prepared. The
chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Pol II, BRCA1, Oct-1, BRD7, and the relevant controls IgG1 and rabbit IgG. Total input DNA (5 ng) was
used as a positive control for PCR. The resulting complex was amplified using ESR1 promoter-specific primers. Nuclear lysate (10 μg) was Western
blotted for BRCA1, BRD7, or Oct-1. The membranes were reprobed for actin to show equal protein loading. C, MCF7 cells were treated with siRNA specific
to BRD7 or SCR control. The chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Pol II, BRCA1, BRD7, BRG1, BAF155, or BAF57 and relevant
controls IgG1 or rabbit IgG. The resulting complex was amplified using primers specific to the ESR1 promoter (top two panels) or with ESR1 control primers
(bottom). Nuclear lysate (10 μg) was Western blotted for BRD7, BRG1, BAF155, or BAF57. The membranes were reprobed for actin to show equal
protein loading. D, T47D cells were transfected with constructs encoding either BRD7 or ΔBRD7 (Δ, deleted in the bromo-domain), and at 48 h
posttransfection, either chromatin or nuclear extracts were prepared. The chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Pol II, BRCA1, BRD7, and
the relevant controls IgG1 or rabbit IgG. The resulting complex was amplified using ESR1 promoter-specific primers. Nuclear lysate (10 μg) was Western
blotted for BRD7. The membranes were reprobed for actin to show equal protein loading.

BRD7 Regulates BRCA1-Dependent Transcription

Figure 5. Depletion of either BRCA1 or BRD7 mediates resistance to the antiestrogen fulvestrant. T47D (A), MCF7 (B), or BT474 cells (C) were transfected
with siRNA to BRCA1, BRD7, ERα, or a SCR sequence. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were plated onto 96-well plates. At 24 h later, the cells were
treated with a range of concentrations of fulvestrant for a further 72 h, and cell number was quantitated using the MTT assay. Sigmoidal growth inhibition
curves were generated, and growth is shown relative to untreated cells for each transfection. Nuclear extracts were prepared at 72 h posttransfection.

have been shown to bind specific transcription factors, for
example, BAF60 binds directly to p53 (14).
BRCA1 has previously been shown to bind directly to
BRG1 (8), which is one of the two ATPases present in
Swi/Snf complexes. BRG1 is present in both BAF and PBAF
Swi/Snf complexes. The interaction of BRCA1 with BRD7
would suggest that BRCA1 may be specific to PBAF Swi/

Snf complexes. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein
composed of amino acids 260 to 553 of BRCA1 was able
to associate with BRG1. We found that BRD7 was unable
to bind in yeast to a BRCA1 construct composed of amino
acids 303 to 927, which retains the BRG1 binding site. Thus
it is likely that BRD7 and BRG1 interact independently and
directly with BRCA1.

The direct binding of BRCA1 to two components of the
Swi/Snf complex suggests that each may have a specific function. The initial observation of BRCA1 interaction with BRG1
showed that an ATPase dead form of BRG1 was able to inhibit the BRCA1-mediated activation of p21 transcription by
p53, suggesting that the chromatin remodeling activity of
BRG1 is important in mediating its effects on BRCA1 transcription (8). We have shown that BRD7 is required for the
recruitment of BRCA1 to the ESR1 promoter. BRG1 is clearly
not sufficient to recruit BRCA1 to the ESR1 promoter, as
shown by the loss of BRCA1 recruitment in the absence of
BRD7, despite the fact that BRG1 is still retained on the promoter. Although the role of BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation is well established, BRCA1 cannot directly bind to DNA
itself. BRD7 possesses a bromodomain and has been shown
to colocalise with acetylated histone H3 and also to bind to a
H3-derived peptide acetylated at Lys14 (15, 16). We have
shown that the association of BRD7 with the ESR1 promoter
correlates with the acetylation of histone H3. In addition deletion of the bromodomain of BRD7 leads to a reduction in
association of BRD7 with the ESR1 promoter. BRCA1 binds
to BRD7 between amino acids 277 to 652, which is outside of
the bromodomain (amino acids 129–236). Thus it would be
possible for BRD7 to simultaneously bind its acetylated histone target via its bromodomain and BRCA1 via its COOH
terminal domain. Acetylation of histone H3 may play a role
in recruiting BRD7 to the promoter, and BRD7 would then be
able to recruit BRCA1 and Oct-1 and drive the transcription
of ERα. Alternatively BRD7 may itself be recruited through
interaction with other Swi/Snf subunits. BAF57 has been
shown to bind directly to both ERα and the androgen receptor and is recruited to both estrogen- and androgen-responsive promoters in a ligand-dependent manner (17, 18). On
this basis it has been proposed that BAF57 is important in
targeting of the Swi/Snf complex to both ERα and androgen
receptor–responsive promoters. Interestingly we have also
shown that BRG1, BAF155, and BAF57 are all retained on
the ESR1 promoter irrespective of the presence of BRD7,
and thus BAF57 or one of the other subunits may target
BRD7 to the ESR1 promoter. In summary our results support
a model whereby, in the context of BRCA1-mediated transcription, the role of BRD7 is to recruit BRCA1 to specific

promoters, whereas for BRG1, its chromatin remodeling activity is likely to be important.
As yet the only cancer in which the expression of BRD7 has
been studied is in nasopharyngeal tumors, wherein its expression is downregulated relative to normal nasopharyngeal
epithelial tissue (19). Overexpression of BRD7 has been
shown to inhibit the growth of nasopharyngeal carcinoma
cells and arrest the cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle
(20). Other subunits of the Swi/Snf family have been implicated in particular cancers, for example, immunohistochemical
staining of tissue microarray samples has revealed that BRG1
or BRM are lost in 10% to 20% of a range of tumor types,
including breast and ovarian tumors. One Swi/Snf subunit,
BAF47, has been classified as a tumor suppressor, as one allele is consistently lost and the other allele is either mutated
or silenced by methylation in pediatric rhabdoid tumors (21).
Our microarray data suggest that BRD7 may be important for
the regulation of up to 30% of BRCA1 targets. It would therefore be interesting in the future to determine if, like BRG1,
BRD7 may also be lost or inactivated in a subset of breast
cancers and if this loss results in the development of tumors
that display a BRCA1-like phenotype.
