BACKGROUND. XL119 is a water-soluble derivative of rebeccamycin with dose-dependent myelosuppression as dose-limiting toxicity in phase 1 studies of solid
tumors. A phase 1 study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated
dose and toxicities of XL119 in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome
and relapsed or refractory acute leukemias.

METHODS. Thirty-one patients were treated at 7 dose levels ranging from 140 to
260 mg/m2/daily times 5 in a 21-day cycle. Consenting patients had correlative
biologic parameters studied.

RESULTS. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3/4 mucositis. The recommended
phase 2 dose in hematologic malignancies is 240 mg/m2/daily times 5 in a 21day cycle. Clinically significant reduction in bone marrow blasts were seen in 5

patients and additional patients had reductions in peripheral blood blasts. However, the responses were transient. Changes of plasma vascular endothelial
growth factor levels from Day 1 to Day 7 correlated negatively with changes in
peripheral blood blasts from Day 1 to Day 7.

patients with acute leukemias and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome is warranted. Cancer 2008;113:360–6. Published 2008 by the American Cancer Society.*

ebeccamycin is an antitumor antibiotic produced by the actinomycete Saccharotrix aerocolonigenes. Rebeccamycin has activity
against topoisomerase I by stabilizing the topoisomerase-DNA covalent complex.1–4 Rebeccamycin is also capable of intercalating DNA
in absence of topoisomerase I. Because of the insolubility of rebeccamycin, semisynthetic and water-soluble derivatives of rebeccamycin have been created. XL119 (NSC 655,649) is such a compound
that is different from rebeccamycin in its mechanism of action. In
contrast to rebeccamycin, XL119 has no activity against topoisomerase I but strongly inhibits topoisomerase II.5 In contrast to topoisomerase II inhibition by both etoposide and teniposide, which
stabilize cleaved DNA by inhibiting religation of the cleaved DNA
strands, XL119 inhibits the catalytic step necessary for the passage
of the intact DNA strand through the single-strand DNA break. This
action leads to the formation of single, rather than double, DNA
strand breaks.
XL119 has antitumor activity against P388 leukemia, melanoma,
reticulum cell sarcoma, lung and colon carcinoma cell lines, and
solid tumor specimens obtained from children.6,7 Against etoposide
resistant cell lines A 549 and HCT 116, the IC50 of XL119 has been
0.03 and 0.19 lM, respectively.8 Keeping in line with its better solubility, XL119 is more active than rebeccamycin in intraperitoneally

implanted P388 murine leukemia model, confirming
its distal site activity. Plasma concentrations achieved
in prior phase 1 studies using an intravenous schedule have been consistently higher than the concentrations (range, 0.03–0.21 lg/mL) required for in vitro
inhibition of topoisomerase II levels.9
Two phase 1 trials of XL119 in nonhematologic
malignancies have explored different dosing schedules. In one, XL119 was given as a single dose every
3 weeks10 and the other study9 explored a dose
schedule of 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Dosedependent myelosuppression has been the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in both studies with minimal
grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity. A third 2-step
phase 1 study examined both the single-dose and
multiple-dose format and has reported similar toxicities.11 Because XL119 has shown preclinical antileukemia activity in an intraperitoneally implanted
leukemia model, topoisomerase II inhibitors have activity in hematologic malignancies and the putative
mechanism of action differs from epipodophyllotoxins, a phase 1 study of XL119 in relapsed/refractory
hematologic malignancies was initiated.
Increased angiogenesis as evidenced by increased microvessel density in the bone marrow is
seen in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).12 Levels of plasma
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a surrogate marker for angiogenesis, have prognostic implications in AML.13,14 Thus, monitoring of VEGF levels
during therapy of leukemias may have a potential for
pharmacodynamic evaluation of activity of investigational agents. Most chemotherapeutic agents induce
cell death by activating the mitochondrial pathway of
apoptosis.15 Activation of terminal caspases like caspase-3 is the convergence point for different pathways of apoptosis. Thus, plasma caspase-3 activity
can potentially provide pharmacodynamic information regarding induction of apoptosis by therapeutic
agents.
Herein we report the first phase 1 study of XL119
in hematologic malignancies. Because preclinical
modeling suggested schedule dependency for this
agent and no significant nonhematologic toxicity was
noted with a 5-day schedule as compared with a
1-day schedule, daily times 5 days every 21 days was
the schedule selected for this study. The results of
correlative studies are also reported.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic
malignancies (AML, acute lymphoid leukemia [ALL],

361

MDS, chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] in blastic phase) were eligible. Eligibility criteria included 1)
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2; 2) age 18 years or older; 3) adequate hepatic
function (serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase
[AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and creatinine
upper limit of normal); and 4) no chemotherapy
except hydroxyurea within 7 days of study drug treatment. All patients gave informed consent according to
federal and institutional guidelines.

Drug Administration
XL119 was supplied by the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) as a sterile vial containing 20 mL of a solution
of 10 mg/mL of rebeccamycin analog and 1 equivalent (2.24 mg/mL) of L-tartaric acid in sterile water
for injection. XL119 was given intravenously through
a central venous catheter (CVC) over 60 minutes
daily for 5 consecutive days. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. The first dose level was 140 mg/m2. The
dose/schedule was based on the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) and DLTs found on solid tumor phase 1
and 2 studies.
All patients who received therapy on study were
considered evaluable for toxicity. Patients were evaluated on the day of therapy and at least weekly (more
often if clinically indicated) while on study. At each
evaluation patients were assessed for toxicity and
complete blood count with platelets and differential,
serum chemistries, liver function tests, and serial
electrocardiograms were obtained.
Planned dose levels were 140, 160, 180, 200, 220,
240, 260 mg/m2/daily times 5 and dose escalations
were carried out in a standard ‘‘3 1 3’’ design. Occurrence of a DLT in any patient was cause for the addition of at least 3 additional patients at that dose
level. DLT was defined as a clinically significant
adverse event (except nausea and vomiting) or
abnormal laboratory value (nonhematologic) assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and
occurring during the first 21 days on study that
meets any of the following criteria:
 Revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) (v. 3.0), grade 3 AST or
ALT elevation for 7 days or grade 4 AST or ALT
elevation of any duration.
 All other clinically significant toxicities that are
CTCAE grade 3 or 4.
 Prolonged myelosuppression, as defined by the
NCI criteria specific for leukemia, eg, marrow cellularity <5% on Day 42 or later from the start of
therapy without evidence of leukemia.

The MTD was defined as the highest dose at
which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experienced DLT.
Patients with any response including clearance of
marrow blasts were eligible to receive additional
cycles. Persistent grade 2 nonhematologic toxicity
required dose reduction in subsequent cycles.
Evaluation of response was done according to
the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria16 at the end of each cycle of treatment. Briefly,
a complete response (CR) required disappearance of
all signs and symptoms related to disease, normalization of the peripheral counts (absolute neutrophil
count of 1 3 109/L and platelet count of
100 3 109/L), and a normal bone marrow morphology with no evidence of dysplasia and 5% or fewer
blasts. A partial response was defined as fulfilling the
criteria for CR in the peripheral blood but with 6% to
25% abnormal cells in the marrow or 50% decrease
in bone marrow blasts compared with pretreatment
values. CRp was defined as per CR but with a platelet
count of <100 3 109/L.

Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell caspase-3 activity
was measured using a tetrapeptide Ac-DEVD-pNA
(Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with 50 lg of cellular
protein extracts. Optical densities were plotted as a
function of time and the slope of the initial linear
portion of the curve was used as a measurement of
the amount of caspase-3 activity. The mean caspase3 activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
normal controls was assigned a value of 1. The activity in the leukemic and MDS samples was normalized to the mean of controls.
Measurement of Plasma VEGF
Plasma VEGF levels were measured using a quantitative sandwich enzyme linked immunoassay (Quantikine; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 100 lL of
plasma was added to VEGF microplate wells and after incubation and washes a polyclonal antibody to
VEGF conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was
added to the wells. Color was developed by adding
tetramethylbenzene as chromogen. Appropriate
standards were incorporated.
Statistical Analysis
A Spearman correlation was used to analyze any possible relation of changes in peripheral blood parameters with plasma caspase activity and VEGF levels on
Days 1, 7, 21, and 28.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Thirty-one patients (median age, 58 years; range,
19–82 years) were enrolled. Three, 5, 3, 6, 3, 9, and 2
patients were enrolled to dose levels of 140, 160,
180, 200, 220, 240, and 260 mg/m2/d, respectively.
Two patients at the 160-mg dose level were replaced;
1 for receiving concomitant white cell transfusions
and the other was taken off study because of a rapid
increase in peripheral blood blast count. Three more
patients were added to the previous cohort of 6
patients at the 240-mg dose level after encountering
DLT at the 260-mg dose level. Diagnoses included:
AML (n 5 25), MDS (n 5 1), and ALL (n 5 5). Nine
of the 25 AML patients had secondary AML and all
but 1 had refractory disease. One patient with AML
was in second relapse after second remission of 4
months. The patient with MDS was of high-risk
category (International Prognostic Scoring System 5 1.5) and had undergone 4 prior therapies. All
patients with ALL had prior therapy and were of
pre-B origin. None of the patients with ALL had
11q23 abnormality. For all patients the median number of prior therapies was 3 (range, 0–10). The characteristics of the patients enrolled are outlined in
Table 1.

are listed in Table 3. Fatigue (20%) was the most
common nondose-limiting grade 3/4 nonhematologic
toxicity. Transient grade 3/4 elevations of AST (13%)
and bilirubin (16%) were the most frequent nonhematologic laboratory abnormalities encountered.
Four patients died while on study: 1 from sepsis,
1 from multisystem organ failure, 1 from progressive
pulmonary insufficiency due to worsening of lung
infiltrates that were present before study participation, and 1 from polymicrobial pneumonia and acute
renal failure. Grade 2 elevation of creatinine was the
most common grade 1/2 toxicity attributable to the
study drug.
One patient at the 200-mg/m2 dose level experienced DLTs in the form of grade 3 hand-foot syndrome and grade 4 mucositis. An expansion of this
cohort yielded no further incidence of DLT. One
patient at the 240-mg/m2 dose level experienced DLT
in the form of grade 3 mucositis. Expansion of this
cohort also did not yield any further incidence of
DLT. Two patients at a dose level of 260 mg/m2

experienced grade 3 mucositis. Three additional
patients were treated at the next-lower dose level of
240 mg/m2 without encountering any DLT and this
dose level was declared the MTD.
At the 220-mg/m2/d dose level, 1 patient experienced a transient grade 3 hypotension that was
attributed to study medication. This hypotension was
not considered a DLT and no DLT was encountered
at this dose level. Also at the 240-mg/m2 dose level,
1 patient was noted to have grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome, but this was not considered a DLT.

Infectious Complications
Fifteen episodes of microbiologically documented
infections were encountered; 13 were bacteremic episodes, 1 polymicrobial pneumonia, and 1 Candida
fungemia. E. coli and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were the most frequent isolates (4 each)
followed by alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Acinetobacter (1), and Enterococcus cloacae (1). Causative agents for the episode
of pneumonia included stenotrophomonas multophilia, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and klebsiela
pneumoniae.

Responses
Three patients with refractory AML achieved a significant elimination of marrow blasts (Figs. 1, 2).
Because of this they received a second cycle. However their disease reappeared soon after. The first
patient at the 140-mg/m2 dose level had reduction of
bone marrow blast percentage from 38 to 14 by Day
28, cycle 1. At the end of the second cycle, however,
the bone marrow blast percentage increased to 47

and patient was taken off-study. The second patient
at the 200-mg/m2 dose level had a decrease of bone
marrow blasts from 31% to 21% at the end of cycle
1, but had an increase in the bone marrow blasts to
48% after the second cycle. The third patient had
received 6 prior therapies and at the 260-mg/m2
dose level developed grade 3 mucositis on Day 15
and was admitted to an outside facility. On his return
to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center his mucositis
had resolved to grade 1 and his bone marrow blasts
went from 73% to 20% on Day 38, his peripheral
blood blasts went down from 53% to 0% by Day 13.
Because of the clinical benefit he received a second
cycle of therapy with XL119 at a reduced dose level
of 240 mg/m2. Unfortunately, this patient developed
recurrent grade 3 mucositis and peripheral blood
blasts that went back on cycle 2 Day 24 to 61%.
Two additional patients, 1 with relapsed/refractory AML (inversion 16 cytogenetics) and the other
with refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive
ALL, had reductions in bone marrow blasts. In the
patient with AML, bone marrow blasts went down
from 89% to 32% but at the end of cycle 1 this
patient developed central nervous system leukemia
and decided not to pursue any further therapy. The
patient with ALL had reduction in the bone marrow
blasts from 93% to 0% and peripheral blood blasts
from 75% to 0% but developed E. coli bacteremia
and invasive fungal infection of the maxillary sinus
and became too debilitated to be considered for any
further therapy. In addition, a significant number of
patients had transient reductions in their peripheral
blood blasts or cleared their peripheral blood blasts
(Fig. 3).

FIGURE 3. Changes in absolute peripheral blood blast counts in all study
patients.

Correlative Biological Studies
Paired samples for Day 1 and Day 7 plasma VEGF
levels were available for 20 patients. A strong correlation was seen between changes in peripheral blood
blast percentage from Day 1 to Day 7 and changes in
plasma VEGF levels on corresponding days
(R 5 20.72, P 5 .0002) (Fig. 4D). No correlation was
observed between peripheral blood parameters and
caspase-3 activity, VEGF levels at other timepoints.

DISCUSSION
On the basis of our study, the recommended phase
2 dose for XL119 in hematologic malignancies is
240 mg/m2 daily for 5 days (through a central vein)
in a 21-day cycle. This dose level is significantly
higher than the 141 mg/m2 (patients with prior therapy) and 175 mg/m2 (patients with no prior therapy)

for 5 days dose level determined in a phase 1 study
conducted in patients with solid tumors.9 Although
myelosuppression was the DLT in solid tumors, this
was a desired effect in the current study in patients
with refractory/relapsed hematologic malignancies.
The grade 1/2 phlebitis encountered in phase 1 studies with solid tumors was not observed in our study,
possibly because of central venous administration
and larger volume of dilution.
Whereas DLT in the form of grade 3/4 mucositis
was occasionally encountered at doses lower than
the MTD, responses in the form of clearance of peripheral blood blasts and reductions in bone marrow
blasts were seen at all dose levels. These reductions
in blasts were achieved rapidly. Because of the cytotoxic activity and the tolerability at lower doses, further study of XL119, perhaps in combination with
other chemotherapeutic agents or targeted agents, is
warranted in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The experiences in studies in

patients with solid tumors indicate that DLTs are
commensurate with extent of prior therapies.
Although the occurrence of DLT in our study population did not correlate with the number of prior therapies (P 5 .5), the median number of prior therapies
in our study patients was 3 and it is quite conceivable that the occurrence of dose-limiting mucositis
will be less frequent in a less heavily pretreated
population.
XL119 showed antileukemic effects at multiple
dose levels. Although no CR, CRp, or PRs were
observed, there was a significant reduction of bone
marrow and peripheral blood blasts in multiple
patients. Considering the finding that most of these
patients had multiple prior therapies, such activity is
promising.
We expected that treatment with XL119 would
induce apoptosis in leukemic blasts and activate caspase-3. Correlative studies did not reveal any difference in plasma caspase-3 levels before and after

366

CANCER

treatment with XL119. One possible explanation for
this is that the mechanism of action of XL119 may
be nonapoptotic cell death. A more likely possibility
is that caspase-3 activation may be occurring very
early and the Day 7 may be too late a timepoint for
caspase-3 activity study.
Conversely, the change in peripheral blood blast
count from Day 1 to Day 7 correlated with a change
in plasma VEGF levels from Day 1 to Day 7. AML
blasts constitutively secrete VEGF and a smaller percentage of AML cells have VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2).17 VEGF can potentially act in an autocrine or
paracrine fashion to enhance growth of AML cells.
VEGF can also induce heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and HSP-90 in turn induces expression of Bcl-2
to impart apoptosis resistance to AML cells.18 Plasma
levels of soluble VEGF is significantly higher in AML
patients at diagnosis, compared with at remission.19
Our published work also demonstrated a correlation
between plasma angiogenic factors and leukemia
outcome.20 The correlation between change in peripheral blood blasts and VEGF levels indicates biological activity of XL119 against leukemic blasts. The
lack of correlation between blast percentage at later
timepoints and VEGF levels may be a function of the
refractory nature of AML blasts and their multiple
mechanisms of developing rapid resistance.
In conclusion, XL119 has antileukemia activity
with a DLT of mucositis. Combination studies with
traditional chemotherapeutic agents as well as biologic agents like anti-VEGF agents, etc, are warranted
as are studies in a less heavily pretreated population.
