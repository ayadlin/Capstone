Agents

Abstract
One impediment to the use of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptortargeted agents as antitumor drugs is the evolution of resistance, a common problem in cancer. On the
contrary, many different kinds of drugs synergize with TRAIL in TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells, raising the
question whether one can overcome resistance with the same drugs producing synergy. This is an important
question, because recent clinical trials suggest that combination treatments with cytotoxic drugs and TRAIL
receptor-targeted agents do not provide additional benefit compared with cytotoxic agents on their own.
Such results might be expected if drug combinations that synergize in sensitive tumor cells but cannot
overcome TRAIL resistance are used in patients whose tumors were not selected for retention of TRAIL
sensitivity. We tested this idea by creating isogenic tumor cells with acquired TRAIL resistance or defined
mechanisms of resistance that occur in human tumors and then comparing them to the TRAIL-sensitive
parental cell line. Although diverse classes of anticancer drugs were all able to synergize with TRAIL in
sensitive cells, most agents were unable to overcome resistance and there was no relationship between the
amount of synergy seen with a particular agent and its ability to overcome acquired resistance. An important
exception was proteasome inhibitors, which were, however, able to overcome diverse resistance mechanisms.
Our findings suggest that one should select drugs for TRAIL receptor agonist combination therapy based not
just on their ability to synergize, but rather on their ability to overcome resistance as well as synergize.

Introduction
Cancer therapy is often hampered because the efficiency
with which susceptible tumor cells are killed is too low and
tumors evolve such that they either present with primary
resistance or acquire resistance over time. To address the first
issue, it is useful to identify agents that synergize when they
are combined. To address the second issue, it is necessary to
find new treatments that avoid the resistance mechanisms or
combine with agents that allow the resistance to be overcome.

It is often assumed that if a drug synergizes with another drug,
then the combination will provide a better way to treat cancer
and that more synergy is better. However, obtaining synergy
and overcoming resistance is not necessarily the same thing.
Just because a drug combination can synergize in susceptible
tumor cells, it does not necessarily follow that the same
combination will be able to overcome resistance.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) receptor-targeted drugs are an interesting type of
anticancer treatment with which to test these ideas, because
these drugs directly activate the apoptosis machinery. There
are many different ways that tumor cells can become resistant
to TRAIL R agonists, and there are a large number of other
agents that can synergize with TRAIL in susceptible tumor cells
(1, 2).
TRAIL R agonists bind to 2 receptors (DR4 and DR5, also
known as TRAIL R1 and TRAIL R2, and TNRSF10a and
TNFRSF10b) to cause the recruitment of an adaptor protein
called FADD, which in turn recruits caspase-8 to form a
platform called the DISC that leads to the activation of
caspase-8 (3). Active caspase-8 induces apoptosis by directly
activating the effector caspase-3 or, more commonly, by
cleavage of the BH3 protein Bid, which leads to release of

cytochrome c and activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis
machinery. Several TRAIL R activating drugs are in clinical
trials and others are in preclinical development (1, 2); in
addition, some other agents may work indirectly through
activation of DR4 and DR5.
Many tumor cell lines are TRAIL resistant (4) and resistance varies in primary human tumor cells. For example, it
has been reported that primary colon cancer cells are usually
sensitive to TRAIL (5), whereas primary astrocytoma cells (5)
and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (6) are not.
Other tumor types, for example, ovarian cancers, show more
variable responses (7). Because TRAIL signaling is an important part of host mechanisms to suppress tumor formation
and metastasis (1, 2), it is to be expected that advanced
cancers would often evolve TRAIL resistance. Diverse
mechanisms that confer selective TRAIL resistance have
been identified in human tumors (8). For example, somatic
mutations in TRAIL receptors, downregulation of DR4 or
DR5 and overexpression of decoy receptors DcR1 and DcR2,
and expression of a tumor-related homeobox transcription
factor called Six1 can all confer selective inhibition to TRAIL.
In addition, more general antiapoptotic mechanisms like
increased expression of Bcl-2 can also cause TRAIL resistance.
A myriad of anticancer drugs including antimetabolites,
DNA-damaging agents, microtubule-targeted drugs, protein
kinase inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, targeted toxins, deacetylase inhibitors, Bcl-2 antagonists, and antibody-based
therapeutics have been reported to synergize with TRAIL
receptor-targeted drugs (1, 2, 8, 9). This broad ability to
synergize along with limited evidence of efficacy as single
agents has led to the view that optimal use of TRAIL Rtargeted drugs will be in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or signal transduction pathway-targeted agents.
Indeed, clinical trials with TRAIL or antibodies against DR4 or
DR5 in combination with other drugs are already underway (1,
10–12). There has not been a consistent set of explanations for
the ability of these diverse agents to synergize with TRAIL.
Because a wide variety of different drugs synergize with
TRAIL, it may be that rather than each different drug causing
synergy by a specific molecular mechanism, much of the
cooperation that has been seen with different drugs and
TRAIL is due to a more general response to combinatorial
stress, that is, because tumor cells are primed to undergo
apoptosis (13), the addition of any other apoptotic stimulus to
TRAIL will significantly increase tumor cell killing and thus
cause synergy. This begs the question of whether all these
synergizing agents are equivalent when used in tumor cells
that are resistant to TRAIL, that is, do drugs that synergize
with TRAIL also overcome resistance? This question is important because recent phase II trials of TRAIL R-targeted drugs
in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy suggest that the
addition of TRAIL R-targeted drug does not improve treatment compared with standard treatment alone (10–12). If
overcoming TRAIL resistance and obtaining synergy are
separable events, it might be expected that such combination
treatments would fail unless the treatments are done in
selected patients whose tumors retain TRAIL sensitivity, or

1884

the combination is with an agent that can overcome TRAIL
resistance as well as causing synergy in TRAIL-sensitive
cells.
To answer this question we examined isogenic BJAB tumor
cell lines. We tested if the parental cells, which are sensitive to
all TRAIL receptor-targeted therapeutics, could synergize with
anticancer drugs that work through different mechanisms. We
developed an isogenic line with acquired TRAIL resistance
through continued exposure to increasing doses of TRAIL
receptor-activating antibody and asked if these cells, or cells
that were made resistant using defined molecular mechanisms that occur in human tumors, could be made sensitive to
TRAIL by combining with drugs that synergize. Surprisingly,
we found that most synergizing drugs could not overcome
resistance and that more synergy does not make it more likely
that the drug will overcome resistance. The most effective
agents at overcoming resistance were proteasome inhibitors
and this ability applied to different, but not all, TRAIL resistance mechanisms. These data show that it is possible to both
obtain synergy and overcome TRAIL resistance by combining
TRAIL receptor-targeted drugs with other agents. However, it
is necessary to choose the correct agent for the combination
because most synergizing drugs do not overcome acquired
resistance and the most synergistic drugs are not necessarily
the best ones to use in combination therapy if the objective is
to try to both increase tumor killing in sensitive cells and
overcome TRAIL resistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Parental BJAB cells, which are an Epstein-Barr virus-negative B lymphoma cell line, were provided previously by Marcus
Peter (University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois). The cells were
most recently fingerprinted using the ABI Identifiler kit in
January 2010, and were distinct from other cells in the merged
DSMZ, ATCC, JCRB, and Riken databases of DNA profiles of cell
lines that are available at DSMZ web site (14) and are therefore
not contaminated with any other cell line. BJAB cells expressing
mutant DR5 in place of the wild-type protein were described
previously (15), the various resistant cells expressing DcR1,
DcR2, FADD-DD, and Six1 were made by stably expressing the
respective cDNA in pcDNA3 puro (16). DR5 and XIAP knockdowns were achieved by stably expressing a lentivirus expressing a DR5- or XIAP-targeted shRNA (Open Biosystems),
whereas BJABLexR cells were made by gradually increasing
lexatumumab concentrations and selecting the cells capable
of continued growth. All cell clones were derived from representative single clone isolated by limiting dilution. Cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, sodium bicarbonate, and
glucose in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 C.
MTS cell viability
Cells were plated in 96-well format at 40,000 cells per well.
Lexatumumab (Human Genome Sciences) was cross-linked
with antihuman IgG Fc (Sigma) for 30 minutes before serial
dilution. TRAIL (R&D Systems) and SuperFas ligand (Enzo
Life Sciences) were prepared according to manufacturer's

end of the experiment, cells were treated with 20 mL of MTS [3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethosxphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; Promega] inner salt according
to manufacturer's instructions. The plate was incubated at
37 C for 2 hours. A Bio-Rad Benchmark Plus microplate
spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used to measure absorbance of samples at 490 nm.
Immunoblotting
One million cells were harvested and lysates were prepared by boiling in SDS buffer 5 minutes prior to gel
electrophoresis. Lysates were resolved on 12% SDS- polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P
transfer membrane (Millipore Corporation). Blots were
blocked with 5% milk in TBST and incubated with antibodies that recognize PARP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (XIAP), Bid, caspase-3, caspase-8 (Cell Signaling
Technologies), Fas associated protein with death domain
(FADD; BD Biosciences), and b-actin (Sigma). Blots were
then incubated with antirabbit or antimouse horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technologies). Detection was done using chemiluminescent
ECL reagent (Millipore Corporation) and developed on blue
X-ray film (Life Science Products).

prior to treatment. TRAIL was used alone and in combination
with the following drugs: MG132 (EMD Biosciences), doxorubicin hydrochloride, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), etoposide, oxamflatin, staurosporine, and D-sorbitol (Sigma). Bortezomib (NSC
681239), sorafenib (NSC 747971), and azacitidine (NSC 102816)
were obtained from The NCI/DTP Open Chemical Repository.
MTS assays were done after 24 hours incubation and
combination index (CI) values were obtained using Calcusyn,
which determines synergy using the median effect principle
comparing the sensitivity to each drug on its own and together
with TRAIL. Synergy was scored as CI values 0.0 to 0.3 (þþþ),
0.3 to 0.7 (þþ), and 0.7 to 1.0 (þ). For the data shown
in Table 1, the doses used for each drug combination were
as follows:

TRAIL synergizes with multiple agents in TRAILsensitive BJAB cells
Although many different kinds of drugs have been reported
to synergize with TRAIL (1, 2, 9), there are few reports in which
the same tumor cells have been treated with different classes of
anticancer drug along with TRAIL to compare the extent of
synergy between different kinds of agents. To do this, we
compared the sensitivity of BJAB cells to TRAIL and different

Acquired TRAIL resistance in BJAB cells is overcome by
only some synergizing agents
To test if acquired TRAIL resistance could be overcome by
combining with the other agents, we selected BJAB cells for
resistance to TRAIL-targeted therapeutics by treating with
increasing doses of the TRAIL R2/DR5 agonistic antibody
lexatumumab. Figure 1A shows that these cells (named
BJABLexR) displayed essentially complete resistance to
TRAIL and lexatumumab, and were also partially resistant
to Fas ligand, which works through a different receptor but a
similar downstream pathway. To test if drugs that synergize
with TRAIL could overcome this acquired resistance, we
treated with increasing doses of TRAIL in the presence of a
low dose of each of the synergizing agents. To ensure that we
examined the effect on TRAIL sensitivity, we normalized
each dose response curve in the absence of the sensitizing
drug compared with sensitizing doses of each of the other
treatments that resulted in no more than 35% cell death on
its own in parental BJAB cells. The parental BJAB and
BJABLexR cells displayed similar sensitivity to all the cytotoxic agents used (Supplementary Fig. S1). Figure 1B shows
that most of the synergistic drugs were unable to sensitize
the BJABLexR cells to TRAIL-induced death. Two types of
drugs were however able to cause TRAIL sensitivity in the
BJABLexR cells; doxorubicin caused some increase in TRAIL
sensitivity and the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib both caused the resistant cells to display dosedependent TRAIL sensitivity close to that observed with
wild-type parental BJAB cells. Despite the fact that some
agents (e.g., etoposide) induced stronger synergy with TRAIL
than the proteasome inhibitors in parental BJABs, resistance
was not overcome by the more synergistic drug. Because
etoposide was significantly more synergistic than proteasome inhibitor, but proteasome inhibitors were effective at
overcoming acquired resistance and etoposide was not,
further experiments focused on these two treatments.

To determine if the sensitivity caused by proteasome inhibition was associated with altered signaling downstream of
the TRAIL receptors, we analyzed proximal events in TRAIL R
signaling in matched wild type and BJABLexR cells. Parental
BJAB cells were similarly sensitive to TRAIL whether or not
Bid was knocked down (Supplementary Fig. S2) indicating
that these cells are Type I cells that do not require amplification through the mitochondrial pathway; however, Bid cleavage (Fig. 2D) and cytochrome c release (data not shown)
occurs after TRAIL R activation in the parental cells, meaning
that Bid cleavage is a useful way to monitor activation of the
caspase-8. Figure 2A shows PARP cleavage in control parental
cells and the BJABLexR cells after treatment with TRAIL, with
or without MG132. In the BJABLexR cells, PARP cleavage only
occurred when MG132 was present but was reduced compared with parental cells. Similarly, apoptotic cleavage of DNA
was only observed in the BJABLexR cells when MG132 was
added (Fig. 2B). TRAIL R stimulation leads to DISC formation,
caspase-8 activation and cleavage leading to Bid cleavage,
XIAP degradation, and caspase-3 cleavage. We therefore
examined the kinetics of these responses in parental BJABs
and the BJABLexR cells with and without MG132 (Fig. 2D, top)
or etoposide (Fig. 2D, bottom). In the resistant cells with
MG132 or etoposide, TRAIL R signaling leads to similar
cleavage of full-length Bid and XIAP with relatively small
differences in the extent or kinetics of these proximal signaling
events in the presence or absence of MG132 or etoposide. As
expected, there was a marked difference in caspase-3 cleavage

kinds of anticancer drugs alone and in combination. To determine the extent of synergy, we used different dose combinations and calculated synergy using the Calcusyn program,
which assesses synergy using the median effect principal to
calculate the CI in which CI equal to 1 indicates additivity, CI
less than 1 indicates synergy, and CI more than 1 indicates
antagonism. Table 1 shows CI values for different dose combinations for various anticancer drugs including proteasome
inhibitors, DNA-damaging agents, antimetabolites, deactylase
inhibitors, a selective protein kinase inhibitor, and an inhibitor
of methyltransferases. In addition, we compared two general
apoptotic stimuli, sorbitol, which induces hyperosmolar stress,
and staurosporine, which is a broad kinase inhibitor. All these
agents caused synergy with TRAIL as indicated by CI values less
than 1. For example, the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide led
to very high synergy (CI < 0.1) whereas the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 produced strong synergy (CI  0.3), and the kinase
inhibitor sorafinib was somewhat less effective (CI ¼ 0.3–0.7).
These data indicate that in the same tumor cells, different
anticancer agents, and even general proapoptotic stimuli, all
synergize with TRAIL although to different extents.

Resistance mechanism

Figure 4. Different mechanisms can confer TRAIL resistance. Matched cell lines BJABDCR1, BJABDCR2, BJABFADD-DN, BJABDR5E338K, BJABDR5 K/D, and
BJABSix1 were treated with TRAIL, lexatumumab, or Fas ligand for 24 hours and viability determined by MTS assay. All the resistance mechanisms conferred
TRAIL resistance to various degrees.

with efficient cleavage in control cells but only MG132-treated
BJABLexR cells displaying extensive caspase-3 cleavage. In
addition, both BJAB and BJABLexR cells displayed similar DISC
formation as determined by recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to precipitated DR5 (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that
the proximal events in TRAIL R signaling are intact in the
resistant BJABLexR cells and the mechanism by which proteasome inhibition overcomes resistance is downstream of DISC
formation and initial signaling events but upstream of caspase-3 cleavage.
One potential mechanism by which the BJABLexR cells
could become resistant to TRAIL is through increased levels
of XIAP, which were higher in the BJABLexR cells as shown by
comparison of the 0 hour time point in Fig. 2D and which
was degraded more slowly in the BJABLexR cells. XIAP can
determine both the kinetics and extent of apoptosis after
TRAIL R signaling (17) and this has been identified as a
potential mechanism through which proteosome inhibitors
can sensitize to TRAIL (18). The combination of bortezimib
and TRAIL R antibodies has also been shown to be more
effective in vivo through a mechanism that was reported to
involve increased activity of caspase-8 and caspase-3 but not
necessarily more mitochondrial depolarization (19). Figure 3
shows that BJABLexR cells had higher levels of XIAP than the

www.aacrjournals.org

parental BJAB cells. Treatment with MG132 caused a small
reduction in the amount of XIAP, but this was still above that
in the parental cells. Knockdown of XIAP in the BJABLexR
cells to levels equal to those in the parental line led to
increased sensitivity to TRAIL that was further increased if
MG132 was added as well. These data indicate that XIAP
elevation may contribute to but does not fully explain the
resistance, and that the ability to overcome resistance by the
proteasome inhibitor involves but is not fully explained by
reduction in XIAP.
Different methods of TRAIL resistance can be overcome
by proteasome inhibition
Because reduction of the elevated XIAP levels only partly
explains the ability of proteasome inhibitors to overcome
resistance in the BJABLexR cells, we hypothesized that by
targeting the proteasome, it may be possible to overcome
mechanistically distinct ways of conferring TRAIL resistance.
To test this hypothesis, we tested various different TRAIL
resistance mechanisms that have been found in human
tumors (8). We tested a variety of different mechanisms
including an inactivating mutation in DR5, E338K, which acts
as a dominant negative mutant, increased expression of two
TRAIL decoy receptors DcR1 and DcR2, reduced expression of

Figure 5. Sensitization experiments with TRAIL resistant cell lines. Parental BJAB cells and matched cell lines with different mechanisms of TRAIL resistance
were pretreated with MG132 or etoposide 24 hours prior to TRAIL treatment and then treated with increasing doses of TRAIL and viability determined by MTS
assay after a further 24 hours. MG132 caused TRAIL sensitivity equivalent to the parental BJAB cells for all resistant cells except the BJABFADD-DN,

expressed a dominant negative FADD molecule (FADD-DD)
that blocks all TRAIL receptor signaling. Fig. 4 shows that each
of these manipulations resulted in TRAIL resistance (albeit to
different extents). To test if the various resistance mechanisms

could be overcome, we compared proteasome inhibition and
etoposide treatment (Fig. 5). MG132 treatment caused TRAIL
sensitivity in the resistant lines equivalent to at least that seen
with the parental BJAB cells for all the resistance mechanisms
except FADD-DD and the mutant DR5 receptor. However,

Overcoming TRAIL Resistance

etoposide treatment did not. The failure of proteasome inhibitors to overcome resistance by FADD-DD is expected
because this mutant prevents recruitment of endogenous
FADD to the DISC and thus blocks all signaling. Additionally,
it has been reported that dominant negative FADD expressing
cells are resistant to proteasome inhibitors in the absence of
exogenous TRAIL (20). Failure to overcome resistance in the
BJABDR5E338K cells is also expected because we previously
showed that this mutant inhibits TRAIL signaling by DR4
through competition for TRAIL binding (15). Decoy receptorinduced resistance was overcome, presumably because
despite their name, these receptors work not just by competing for TRAIL binding but instead by forming heteromeric
complexes with the signaling receptors and altering their
downstream signaling capacity (21). These data show that
distinct mechanisms of TRAIL resistance can be overcome by
proteasome inhibition but not etoposide treatment and that
this extends to mechanisms that act at the receptor and those
that activate downstream of the DISC.

Discussion
Our experiments and data from other groups show that
TRAIL can synergize with various different kinds of anticancer
treatments when tested in tumor cells that are TRAIL sensitive. Indeed, we find strong synergy even with general apoptotic stimuli such as increased hyperosmolar stress. The
ability of a wide variety of agents to synergize with TRAIL
suggests that there is no common underlying mechanism such
as increased receptor expression; instead, these data are more
consistent with synergy being caused by the addition of
distinct apoptotic stimuli moving the tumor cells closer to
their apoptotic threshold thus making it easier for the added
signal coming from TRAIL receptor activation to push the cell
over the threshold.
However, many tumor cells display resistance to TRAIL and,
as shown here, susceptible tumor cells can easily acquire
resistance. Thus, given the wide variety of agents that can
synergize with TRAIL in sensitive cells, the question arises
whether these agents can also work effectively with TRAIL in
resistant cells. Our data show that achieving synergy in susceptible tumor cells and sensitizing resistant tumor cells are
not the same, and it may be better to design combination
therapies with agents like the proteasome inhibitors that are
able to do both rather than develop combinations with drugs
like etoposide that although very good at synergizing with
TRAIL, are not good at overcoming resistance. Proteasome
inhibitors may be able to do this because in addition to moving
the tumor cells closer to their apoptotic threshold, inhibition of
the proteasome affects multiple apoptosis regulators and thus
increases the likelihood that any specific resistance mechanism can be bypassed. The fact that proteasome inhibition can
overcome resistance in matched cells that occur both downstream of the DISC (e.g., with BJABSix1 and BJABLexR cells) and
at the DISC (e.g., with BJABDCR1 and BJABDCR2 cells) supports
this idea. Additional support comes from the fact that other
studies of the ability of proteasome inhibitors to synergize with
TRAIL have identified different alterations in the TRAIL signal-

www.aacrjournals.org

ing pathway associated with proteasome inhibition including
reduced degradation of effector caspases (17), altered Bcl-xL
levels (22), increased expression of receptors (23), and
increased caspase activity (19). It has also been reported that
a group of primary glioma cells from different patients can all
be sensitized irrespective of the heterogeneity of the tumors (5).
Together, these results from diverse tumor types along with our
experiments in matched cells suggest that proteasome inhibitors are not only good at synergizing with, but are also good at
overcoming TRAIL resistance. This is due to their ability to
target different resistance mechanisms at the same time, thus
making it more likely that any given mechanism will be affected
by the drug combination.
Recent results of randomized phase II trials of TRAIL Rtargeted drugs reported at the 2010 American Society of
Clinical Oncology meeting were not encouraging; combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab did not show additional benefit from the TRAIL Rtargeted drug in non-small cell lung cancer patients (10–12).
However, these combinations were not chosen because the
other drugs were able to overcome TRAIL resistance, rather
the origination of these treatments was because (in cells that
are susceptible to TRAIL) the cytotoxic agents could synergize
and the drugs were already used to treat non-small cell lung
cancer. Our data therefore show the need to understand the
underlying reason for resistance if one wants to use "targeted"
agents like TRAIL R agonists. For example, one resistance
mechanism that has been found in human tumors (somatic
mutation in DR5) was not overcome with the proteasome
inhibitors, however, we previously showed that the inhibitory
effect of the DR5 mutation could be bypassed through the use
of a TRAIL receptor agonist (mapatumumab) that is targeted
only to DR4 (15). However, the practical importance of this
kind of approach may be limited because such TRAIL
receptor mutations are rare in human tumors (24–27). On
the contrary, another resistance mechanism (Six1 overexpression) that can be overcome by combination with proteasome
inhibitors is common, being found in more than 60% of
metastatic ovarian cancers (28) and up to 90% of metastatic
breast cancers (29, 30), and associated with poor clinical
outcomes in lymphoma and other cancer types (31). These
data suggest that optimal use of TRAIL R-targeted drugs will
require that we identify resistance mechanisms in a person's
tumor and use strategies like selective targeting of DR4 in DR5
mutant tumors when they are justified, but that in more
common cases (such as with Six1 overexpressing tumors),
we maximize both the amount of tumor killing and the ability
to overcome resistance by combining TRAIL R-targeted drugs
with agents that not only synergize but are also able to
overcome resistance and, especially, resistance that is driven
by more than one molecular mechanism if possible. Proteasome inhibitors may be a good place to start with this kind of
approach.
