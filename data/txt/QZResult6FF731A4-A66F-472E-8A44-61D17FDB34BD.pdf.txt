Abstract
Activation of Notch signaling in hematopoietic cells by
tumors contributes to immune escape. T-cell defects in tumors
can be reversed by treating tumor-bearing mice with multivalent forms of the Notch receptor ligand DLL-1, but the immunologic correlates of this effect have not been elucidated. Here,
we report mechanistic insights along with the efﬁcacy of combinational treatments of multivalent DLL-1 with oncoprotein
targeting drugs in preclinical mouse models of lung cancer.
Systemic DLL-1 administration increased T-cell inﬁltration into
tumors and elevated numbers of CD44þCD62LþCD8þ memory T cells while decreasing the number of regulatory T cells and
limiting tumor vascularization. This treatment was associated
with upregulation of Notch and its ligands in tumor-inﬁltrating

T cells enhanced expression of T-bet and phosphorylation of
Stat1/2. Adoptive transfer of T cells from DLL1-treated tumorbearing immunocompetent hosts into tumor-bearing SCIDNOD immunocompromised mice attenuated tumor growth
and extended tumor-free survival in the recipients. When combined with the EGFR-targeted drug erlotinib, DLL-1 signiﬁcantly improved progression-free survival by inducing robust
tumor-speciﬁc T-cell immunity. In tissue culture, DLL1 induced
proliferation of human peripheral T cells, but lacked proliferative or clonogenic effects on lung cancer cells. Our ﬁndings
offer preclinical mechanistic support for the development of
multivalent DLL1 to stimulate antitumor immunity. Cancer Res;

Introduction

regulate the expression of various tissue-speciﬁc transcriptional
activators (2, 3).
An important role for Notch has been proposed in the modulation of T-cell differentiation and immune responses. Evidence
supports that Notch–DLL1 interaction can upregulate T-bet, stimulate IFNg expression, and promote Th1 cell differentiation (4).
Conditional transgenic expression of Notch1 intracellular
domain (ICD) in antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells induced a central
memory phenotype and increased cytotoxicity effects and granzyme B levels (5). Gain-of-function studies indicate that Deltalike Notch ligands (DLL) promote Th1 commitment of CD4þ T
cells (6, 7). By transactivating Th2-promoting target genes IL4 and
Gata3, Notch can also promote Th2 cell differentiation (8, 9).
Although controversial, the bias is that Jagged ligands are associated with Th2-promoting Notch function (6, 10). Unlike other
ligands, DLL3 is unable to activate Notch in cultured cells and
seems to inhibit Notch signaling (11).
In vivo, overexpression or inhibition of Notch ligands on
antigen-presenting cells (APC) suggested that APC-bound ligands
might specify Th differentiation, with DLL and Jagged supporting
Th1 and Th2 polarization, respectively (12–15). In addition to
inﬂuencing Th1 and Th2 differentiation, an immunosuppressive
function of Notch ligands has also been identiﬁed. Expression of
Jagged ligands by APCs or hematopoietic progenitors favored
generation of suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) in vivo (16–18).
Regulation of IL17 and RORgt gene promoters and activation of
Th17 differentiation has also been reported for Notch ligands
(19). These data clearly conﬁrm the immune modulatory function

Notch is a family of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane
receptors and ligands, and regulates a variety of processes in
development and differentiation, including cell fate decisions
(1). The mammalian Notch family includes four cell-bound
Notch receptors, Notch1–4, and ﬁve Notch ligands DLL1, DLL3,
DLL4, Jagged1, and Jagged2, which are also cell bound. Multiple
downstream Notch target genes, including Hes, Hey, and Deltex,

Multivalent DLL1 in Cancer Immunotherapy

of Notch ligands. However, no information is available on the
role of Notch ligand-speciﬁc signaling in antitumor immune
effector functions.
Our recent work revealed a mechanistic link in the molecular
pathways underlying the tumor-induced perturbation of hematopoietic Notch signaling and demonstrated that altered expression
of Notch ligands attenuated Notch signaling in the hematopoietic
compartment of tumor-bearing host as a means of causing
immunosuppression. This Notch-mediated immune suppression
could be reversed by the enhanced DLL1-mediated Notch signaling in hematopoietic microenvironment (20–22). This predicted
a novel therapeutic approach based on the stimulation of Notch
signaling using soluble multivalent form of DLL1 to overcome
cancer-associated immunosuppression, stimulate antitumor
immunity and attenuate tumor growth.
In the present study, we evaluated the immunologic correlates
of the systemic activation of Notch signaling using clustered DLL1
and its efﬁcacy in combination with oncogene-targeted treatment
in the mouse lung cancer model. We show that DLL1-based
therapy can induce robust tumor antigen-speciﬁc T-cell effector
and memory responses, enhance T-cell inﬁltration into the tumor,
while decreasing Treg differentiation and tumor angiogenesis
without increasing the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells. Such
an activation of DLL1–Notch signaling suppressed tumor growth
in wild-type mice as well as provided signiﬁcant therapeutic
beneﬁt following an adoptive T-cell transfer into tumor-bearing
SCID-NOD mice. Combined with mutant EGFR-targeted treatment by erlotinib, multivalent DLL1 signiﬁcantly improved progression-free survival (PFS). This supports the potential therapeutic utility of multivalent Notch ligand in cancer treatment settings.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The human lung cancer cell lines (H157, H460, HCC15,
HCC1437, HCC1264, and HCC2469) and murine Lewis lung
carcinoma (LLC) cell line were obtained from the ATCC; lowpassage (less than 10) cultures were used for the experiments.
D459 cells are murine ﬁbroblasts malignantly (murine ﬁbrosarcoma) transformed in our laboratory by transfection of human
Ras and mutant human p53 (21, 23). Our laboratory is the
primary source of these cells, and we regularly go back to reference
stocks to ensure ﬁdelity; routine sterility and Mycoplasma testing
were performed regularly.
Mice and tumor models
Female Balb/c, C57BL/6, and SCID/NOD mice (7- to 8-weekold) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mutant EGFR
tetracycline-inducible transgenic mouse line that expresses an
L858R mutant human EGFR in lung epithelial cells was described
earlier and provided by Dr. William Pao (Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN; ref. 24).
The animals were housed in pathogen-free units at the
Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, in compliance with
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations.
To induce tumor, mice were inoculated s.c. in ﬂank with 0.3 
106 D459 or LLC cells, as described previously (21, 25). For
s.q. models, tumor volume was measured with calipers and
tumor tissues were weighed at the endpoint of the experiments. In mutant EGFR mouse model, tumor growth was
induced and sustained for the length of the experiment by
providing mice with doxycycline in chow and the size of lung

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor was evaluated by MRI in vivo, as described previously
(24). For this model, tumor recurrence was recorded when
tumor volume exceeded by 30% the residual volume after
erlotinib treatment.
DLL1 clusters and treatment regimen
Mouse or human DLL1–Fc fusion protein is composed of the
extracellular domain of mouse or human DLL1 and the Fc part of
mouse IgG2A or human IgG1, respectively. To form DLL1 clusters,
DLL1-Fc, biotinylated anti-IgG antibodies, and NeutrAvidin
(Pierce) were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:4:10 in PBS, as described
earlier (21, 26). As a control in all applications, Fc fragment of
mouse IgG2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used instead of DLL1–Fc.
Mouse DLL1–Fc and biotinylated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from R&D Systems; human DLL1-Fc and biotinylated
goat anti-human IgG antibodies—from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.
Tumor-bearing mice received clustered DLL1 at doses of 0.15
mg/kg (4 mg/injection) of DLL1-Fc protein in 100 mL of PBS i.p.
every other day (length of treatment is indicated in the ﬁgure
legends and Results section). The control group received control
clusters with Fc fragments instead of DLL1–Fc protein. Twice
higher doses of clustered DLL1 were used in some experiments
with similar results suggesting dose saturation of the clustered
DLL1 effects.
In mutant EGFR tumor model, mice were treated with clustered
DLL1 or control clusters, as above, from days 12 to 28 after tumor
induction by doxycycline, whereas erlotinib was given during
days 15 to 25 daily at a dose of 50 mg/kg, i.p., as previously
described (24).
In separate experiments, nontumor mice Balb/c mice
received clustered DLL1 or control clusters injections every
other day for total of three times. Hematopoietic tissues from
these mice were collected on the second day after the last
injection and evaluated for the expression of Notch receptors,
Notch ligands, and downstream Notch target genes Hes1, Hey1,
and Deltex by qRT-PCR.
Immunologic assays
D459 cells have a deﬁned mutant p53 antigenic peptide (FYQLAKTCPVQL, aa 128-139; ref. 27). Induction of antigen-speciﬁc
responses in this model was characterized by evaluation of IFNgproducing T cells, as follows: splenocytes or LN cells from D459
tumor-bearing mice treated with clustered DLL1 or control clusters were stimulated with 10 mmol/L of mutant p53 or control
peptide for 60 hours; IFNg intracellular staining was performed
using Mouse Intracellular Cytokine Staining Kit (BD Pharmingen)
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Data were
acquired with FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems). Gates were set on CD8þ or CD8þCD44þCD62Lþ
cells. LLC cells also have a deﬁned antigenic peptide MUT1
(spontaneously mutated connexin 37, FEQNTAQP (28, 29).
Splenocytes and lymph node (LN) cells (2.5  105 cells/well)
from LLC tumor-bearing mice treated with control or DLL1
clusters were stimulated with 10 mmol/L of MUT1 or control
peptide for 48 hours and IFNg-producing cells were enumerated
by ELISPOT assay (CTL) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
For the mutant EGFR model, lungs were assessed for the inﬁltration by IFNg-producing cells and other immune cells. Lung singlecell suspensions were prepared, as described previously (25).
IFNg-producing cells were enumerated by intracellular staining
and inﬁltration by immune lineages was assessed by ﬂow

cytometry (see below). CD45þ cells for evaluation of Notch
signaling were isolated from lung single-cell suspensions, as
described earlier (30).
Peptides were synthesized by the American Peptide Company,
Inc.
Flow cytometry
Fluorochrome-labeled cell-surface marker or intracellular protein speciﬁc antibodies were obtained from BD Bioscience Pharmingen and eBioscience, Inc. For staining of cell surface markers,
cells were incubated with the antibodies for 20 minutes on ice. For
intracellular cytokines, FoxP3, Stat, or phospho-Stat (p-Stat) cells
were ﬁrst stained for lineage-speciﬁc markers, and then permeabilized for 20 minutes with BD ﬁxation/permeabilization kit and
incubated with ﬂuorochrome-labeled or unlabeled speciﬁc antibodies for 30 minutes on ice. When unlabeled primary antibodies
were used, cells were washed, and then stained with ﬂuorochromeconjugated secondary antibodies. Matched ﬂuorochrome-conjugated isotype IgG controls were used. Flow-cytometry data were
acquired using a FACS LSR II (BD Immunocytometry) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Nonviable cells were
excluded by using 7-amino actinomycin D. Antigen negativity was
deﬁned as having the same ﬂuorescent intensity as the isotype
control.
Adoptive T-cell transfer
Splenocytes and tumor-draining LN cells from D459 tumorbearing mice were collected on day 25 after inoculation of D459
cells and mixed; then, 5  106 cells were injected into retro-orbital
plexus of SCID-NOD mice bearing palpable (3–4 mm) D459
tumors. Tumor growth was monitored and tumors weighted at
the end of the experiment.
Expression levels of Notch receptors, ligands and downstream
targets, and transcription factors
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify expression of Notch downstream target genes, receptors and ligands as
well as T-bet, Gata3, RORgt, and FoxP3 transcription factors in
samples of mouse hematopoietic tissues or tumor cells using
primers described earlier (21, 31). RNA was extracted with an
RNeasy Mini Kit and possible genomic DNA contamination was
removed by on-column DNase digestion using the RNase–free
DNase set (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript
III Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen). cDNA, iQ SYBR green
supermix (Bio-Rad) and gene-speciﬁc primers (see in Supplementary Table S1) were used in 20 mL PCR reactions as recommended
by the manufacturer. Ampliﬁcation of endogenous b-actin or
GAPDH was used as internal controls.
Western blot and ligand precipitation
Cells or tissues were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20
mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X100, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2 with set of
inhibitors, as described previously (32). Equal amounts of
protein were mixed with SDS sample buffer and separated by
7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The following
antibodies were used for detection: Notch1 (Cell Signaling
Technology); Notch2 (Origene Technologies); Notch3 and
DLL4 (Abcam); Notch4 (Millipore); Jag1 (Cell Signaling Technology); Jag2 (Thermo Scientiﬁc); DLL1 (Sigma-Aldrich); DLL4

(Abcam); GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All antibodies
recognize epitopes in ICD of Notch.
To determine the interaction of clustered DLL1 with different
Notch ligands, mouse thymus lysate in the above buffer was
prepared and proteins were precipitated with a complex of
DLL1-Fc with anti-Fc antibodies bound to protein-G magnetic
beads (Pierce); as a control, Fc fragment was used instead of DLL1Fc. Beads were then washed and mixed with SDS sample buffer for
the subsequent Western blot analysis of bound proteins.
Note that as full-length Notch is composed of two noncovalently bound domains, on Western blot analysis in denaturing/
reducing conditions with antibodies to ICD epitopes, it appears as
ICD band of approximately 110 kD or 90 kD for Notch1 and 2 or
Notch3 and 4, respectively. In some cases, in cancer cells where
Notch expression is high, full-length Notch could also be seen
under these conditions.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor tissue was extracted, ﬁxed in 10% formalin, embedded
in parafﬁn, and sectioned (5 mm). Slides were stained with
peroxidase-labeled antibodies to the CD3e (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD11b, Gr1, or CD34 cell surface markers (Novus
Biologicals). The number of cells or tumor blood vessels identiﬁed by peroxidase substrate staining was counted using a Nikon
Eclipse E600 with a 40/1.0 NA Plan Apochromat oil objective
(Nikon Instruments) and with Olympus DP-11 digital camera
(Olympus America). Images were processed using Meta-Morph
5.0.7 (Universal Imaging) and ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD)
software.
Cell proliferation and colony-forming assays
Human peripheral blood was drawn from healthy consented
donors according to the protocol approved by the Vanderbilt
University School of Medicine Internal Review Board. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by gradient
centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare). Proliferation
of T cells was measured using the intracellular dye carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes; Life Technologies). PBMC were stimulated with Dynabeads Human T-Activator (anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-CD137 antibodies coupled
to beads; Life Technologies), as recommended by the manufacture, with 0.5 mg/mL multivalent DLL1 (based on DLL1-Fc protein) or control clusters for 4 days. T-cell proliferation was assessed
by CFSE dilution in CD3þ cells by ﬂow cytometry.
To evaluate the proliferation of human and murine cancer cells,
cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 16 hours in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Then, 1 mg/mL
clustered DLL1 (based on DLL1-Fc protein) or control clusters
were added and cells were cultured for additional for 24 hours; for
the last 2 hrs of incubation 1 mCi [3H-thymidine] per well was
added and [3H-thymidine] incorporation was assessed by liquid
scintillation counting, as described earlier (33).
Colony formation of human lung cancer cells in soft agar was
performed, as previously described (34), with 2,500 cells seeded
in 6-well plate in DMEM with 10% FBS. Colonies were counted
after 2 weeks.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 software
(GraphPad Software Inc.) and presented as mean  SEM. Comparisons between treatment and control groups were performed

using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's posttests. Comparisons between two groups were performed using two-tailed
unpaired t tests. Survival curves were compared using the Mantel–Haenszel log rank test. Values were considered statistically
signiﬁcant when a P value was less than 0.05.

Results
Multivalent DLL1 interacts with Notch receptors and
upregulates hematopoietic Notch signaling in vivo
Activation of Notch receptor proteolytic cleavage and signaling
requires a multivalent interaction between Notch receptors and
ligands, whereas soluble forms of ligands act as Notch inhibitors
(35). In this study, we used a multivalent or clustered form of
DLL1, which was a complex of DLL1–IgG Fc fusion proteins with
biotinylated anti-Fc antibody and avidin (21), acting as an activator of Notch.
Notch system appears to be very sensitive to modulation by its
ligands. We performed ligand precipitation experiments to determine the Notch receptors that bind clustered DLL1. DLL1-Fc–antiFc antibody complex or Fc–anti-Fc antibody complex, as a control, were bound to protein G magnetic beads and the beads were
added to the mouse thymus lysate to pull down the interacting
Notch receptors. Western blot analysis of the precipitated proteins
revealed that all four Notch receptors interact with clustered DLL1,
thus suggesting that each of them could be involved in mediation
of the observed effects of the enhanced DLL1 signal (Fig. 1A).
To explore the effects of clustered DLL1 on hematopoietic
Notch system in vivo, clustered DLL1 was injected in healthy mice
i.p. every other day for a total of three doses and Notch signaling
was evaluated on the second day after the last administration.
qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that such treatment sustained
signiﬁcantly elevated levels of Notch target genes (Fig. 1B). The
clustered DLL1 reagent seems to deliver activating DLL1 signals to
all hematopoietic organs, as changes in the expression of one or
more Notch genes are detectable in all organs except LNs, which
could be due to the low vascularization/circulation of LNs or be an
attribute of the Notch system response in LN cells.
Clustered DLL1 also altered receptor and ligand expression
patterns in these sites (Fig. 1C and D). The expression pattern of
Notch receptors and ligands appears to be tissue speciﬁc. Bone
marrow, blood, and spleen show signiﬁcantly increased Notch
signaling as well as the expression of Notch ligands following
clustered DLL1 administration (Fig. 1C and D). High levels of
Notch ligand expression in these organs might associate with the
high number of myeloid cells, which are known to be a source of
Notch ligands for the differentiating lymphocytes (6, 7). The
magnitude of Notch receptor expression changes is highest in
the spleen and thymus, which corresponds to the high number of
lymphoid cells in these tissues—the recipients of the activating
signals from the ligands (Fig. 1C). The increased expression of
Notch receptors and ligands upon pharmacologic DLL1-mediated
stimulation may result in the ampliﬁcation of the initial signal.
This might explain why relatively low doses of clustered DLL1
produce signiﬁcant biologic effects.
Pharmacologic enhancement of DLL1-mediated Notch
signaling supports effector T-cell differentiation and survival in
tumor-bearing mice
Notch signaling plays an important role in regulating differentiation of naive CD4þ T cells into distinct Th lineages. We found

www.aacrjournals.org

that systemic administration of clustered DLL1 in LLC tumorbearing mice stimulated phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2
transcription factors in CD4þ T cells (Fig. 2A and B) that are
associated with Th1 differentiation. Enhanced Stat1 signaling in
CD4þ T cells from DLL1-treated mice correlated with the increase
in the expression of T-bet—a mediator of transcriptional effects of
Stat1 on T-cell differentiation. Among the lineage-speciﬁc transcription factors involved in the regulation of Th cell differentiation, only T-bet gene expression displayed signiﬁcant upregulation, whereas expression of Gata3, RORgt, and FoxP3 genes, as
analyzed in a pool of splenocytes and LN cells from treated LLCbearing mice, did not show any signiﬁcant change (Fig. 2C).
Statistically signiﬁcant upregulation in phosphorylation of Stat3,
responsible for the survival of activated T cells (22), was also
detected, thus suggesting improved T-cell survival (Fig. 2A).
Clustered DLL1 therapy improves antitumor T-cell function
and memory
We demonstrated earlier using different mouse models that
therapeutic enhancement of DLL1/Notch signaling produces
signiﬁcant T-cell–mediated attenuation of tumor growth (21).
Here, we investigated whether such therapy is capable of enhancing tumor-speciﬁc immune responses and generating speciﬁc
tumor-protective T-cell memory in lung tumor models, LLC and
D459, where tumor-speciﬁc antigenic peptides have been identiﬁed, thus allowing the assessment of tumor-speciﬁc immune
responses.
Treatment of mice with clustered DLL1 or control cluster for 10
days after s.c. injection of LLC cells elicited strong antigen-speciﬁc
CTL response to the endogenous LLC tumor antigen MUT1.
Higher number of IFNg-secreting cells were noted in spleens and
LNs of mice treated with DLL1 clusters than in the control group
after restimulation with tumor antigenic peptide MUT1 (Fig. 2D).
This correlated with signiﬁcantly smaller tumor mass in clustered
DLL1-treated mice than in control clusters-treated animals (not
shown). These results suggest high efﬁcacy of clustered DLL1 as an
immunization adjuvant.
In D459 model, s.c. tumor appeared on days 7 to 8 after cell
inoculation and developed rather slowly for an additional 10 to
12 days, after which tumor grows exponentially (Fig. 3A). Clustered DLL1 or control clusters were administered after tumors
were established (tumor diameter 4–5 mm) from days 7 to 19
every other day (Fig. 3A). Clustered DLL1 delayed tumor growth
when compared with the control cluster (Fig. 3A). Immunologic
parameters were examined on day 21 when the differences in
tumor size in control and clustered DLL1 groups were still
insigniﬁcant. This excluded variations in the systemic immunologic effect due to tumors of differing sizes. Signiﬁcantly higher
levels of T-cell activation marker CD25 and intracellular IFNg
production were observed in the splenic and LN CD8þ T cells
following re-challenge with D459 tumor antigenic–mutant p53
peptide (Fig. 3B). Moreover, multivalent DLL1 therapy resulted in
a signiﬁcant increase of splenic CD44þCD62Lþ CD8þ T cells
characterized as central memory effector T cells (Fig. 3C and
D). Among CD44þCD62Lþ CD8þT cells, there were signiﬁcantly
more IFNg-producing T cells after re-stimulation with the cognate-mutant p53 peptide, thus indicating increased number and
function of tumor-speciﬁc memory T cells (Fig. 3E). In addition to
stimulating robust antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses, systemic activation of DLL1/Notch signaling resulted in moderate, but statistically signiﬁcant reduction of the number of regulatory T cells in

effects might have contributed to the observed inhibitory effect on
tumor growth.
Induction of DLL1-induced T-cell effector memory and protective immunity was further conﬁrmed in the adoptive T-cell
transfer experiments. A total lymphocyte fraction from a pool
of splenocytes and tumor-draining LN cells, to have a higher
frequency of tumor antigen-speciﬁc T cells, from D459 tumorbearing Balb/c mice treated with clustered DLL1 or control
clusters were transferred i.v. into SCID-NOD mice bearing
palpable D459 tumors. Lymphocytes transferred from clustered
DLL1-treated donors, but not from the control-treated animals,
signiﬁcantly attenuated tumor growth in SCID-NOD mice
(Fig. 4A and B).
These data strongly suggest that the multivalent DLL1-mediated Notch activation possesses functional capacity to induce
tumor-speciﬁc T-cell responses and memory, resulting in the
signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁt in tumor models. They imply
strong association of the DLL1–Notch axis in regulation of the
T-cell–mediated antitumor immunity.

prognosis in human patients (36). In this model, no signiﬁcant
differences were found in the number of tumor-inﬁltrating
Gr1þ or CD11bþ myeloid cells between clustered DLL1-treated

with endothelial marker CD34 revealed signiﬁcantly decreased
vascularization of tumors in multivalent DLL1-treated animals
than in control animals (Fig. 4D). This result is in line with the
observation that DLL1-induced Notch signaling has suppressive effect on tumor growth in B16 melanoma model due to the
attenuated vascularization (37).
These data suggest that the antiangiogenic effect of multivalent DLL1 therapy together with the enhanced antitumor T-cell
responses contribute to tumor-inhibitory effects in therapeutic
settings.

bearing activating EGFR mutations with EGFR inhibitors represents an example of successful oncogenic pathway–targeted therapy. EGFR gene in-frame deletions in exon 19 and L858R mutation in exon 21 constitute nearly 90% of the lung adenocarcinoma
somatic-activating mutations and have been associated with
sensitivity and rapid clinical response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) geﬁtinib and erlotinib (38, 39). However, in most
of responding patients, the cancer resumes detectable growth
within several months (38, 40). We tested whether integrating
the multivalent DLL1-based immunotherapy with oncogene-targeted TKI would induce sustained immune responses and longlasting remission in sensitive tumors. We used a tetracyclineinducible transgenic mouse line that expresses an L858R-mutant
human EGFR in lung epithelial cells (24). The expression of EGFR

mutant leads to the development of lung adenocarcinomas in 2 to
3 weeks after doxycycline induction with erlotinib treatment
causing rapid tumor regression (24). In our regimen, during the
doxycycline tumor induction, mice received two injections of
clustered DLL1, and then a combination of erlotinib with clustered DLL1 followed by two more injections of clustered DLL1;
mice then were left untreated (Fig. 5A). The control group received
control clusters instead of multivalent DLL1. Tumor size was
monitored at different time points by MRI with tumor recurrence
determined when the volume of tumor exceeded the residual
tumor volume after erlotinib treatment by 30%. EGFRL858R
mutant mice were highly responsive to the clustered DLL1 combination therapy, as seen by the decreased lung tumor burden and
signiﬁcantly improved PFS (Fig. 5A and B).

Analysis of the hematopoietic Notch signaling, protein expression, and immunologic parameters revealed that the observed
therapeutic effects correlated with the enhanced Notch signaling
and improved immune responses (Fig. 6). Treatment with multivalent DLL1 signiﬁcantly upregulated the expression of downstream Notch targets Hes1, Hey1, and Deltex1 in lung-inﬁltrating
immune cells of tumor-bearing EGFRL858R transgenic animals as
well as enhanced the expression of splenic Delta-like ligands, Jag2
and Notch1, 2, and 3 receptors, thus apparently reversing previously observed tumor-induced deﬁciency in hematopoietic Notch
signaling and ligand expression (Fig. 6A and B; ref. 21). Administration of clustered DLL1 resulted in signiﬁcant alterations in the

found remarkably increased numbers of INFg-producing T cells
and CD11bþCD11chigh dendritic cells (DC), despite the moderate
decrease in the total inﬁltrating CD3þ T cells. Worth noting is also
the increased number of CD19þ B cells (Fig. 6C). The data suggest
that the enhancement of DLL1/Notch signaling provides beneﬁt
in combination treatment with oncogene-targeted drugs due to
the improved antitumor immunity.

T-cell function. PBMCs from human donors were stimulated with
beads-coupled CD3, CD28, and CD137 antibodies with or without multivalent DLL1 for 4 days. Proliferation of gated CD3þ T
cells, as assessed by CFSE dilution, demonstrated that clustered
DLL1 enhanced proliferation of human peripheral T cells (Fig. 7A).
The pleiotropic functions of Notch and complex effect of
interference with this signaling pathway raise legitimate safety
concerns regarding systemic activation of Notch signaling by the
multivalent DLL1. We assessed the effect of this reagent on
tumorigenic properties of different human lung and mouse cancer
cells. Various tumor cell lines that we tested expressed Notch
receptors (Fig. 7B) and showed varying kinetics and levels of RNA
expression of target genes, Hes1 and Hey1 following culture with
mouse or human multivalent DLL1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
However, of high clinical signiﬁcance is the fact that this activated
signaling did not translate into the increased proliferation or
clonogenicity of tumor cells (Fig. 7C and D). Rather, clustered
DLL1 had antiproliferative and/or anticlonogenic effect on some
tumor cells (H157, H460, HCC2429 and H460, H1437,
respectively; Fig. 7C and D). Moreover, DLL1-treated mice
showed no clinically abnormal behavior or any difference in
body or organ weight compared with the control mice. No gross

abnormalities were noted, nor was there any substantial changes
in the numbers of red or white blood cells, lymphocytes or
platelets counts in the peripheral blood following DLL1 treatments (data not shown).

Discussion
T-cell immune surveillance against tumors is well established.
However, induction of tumor-induced deﬁciencies in T-cell differentiation and function is a fundamental mechanism for tumor
escape from the host immune system. We reported earlier a
previously unidentiﬁed mechanism for tumor-associated defects
in T lymphocytes mediated by the alteration of the expression
pattern of Notch ligands and reduced Notch signaling in the
hematopoietic compartment. Selective systemic activation of
Notch signaling by a multivalent form of DLL1 resulted in
signiﬁcant attenuation of tumor growth in a T-cell–dependent
manner in tumor models (21). The current study elucidates the
immunologic consequences of the pharmacologic enhancement
of DLL1 signaling and tests the hypothesis that the multivalent
DLL1-based immunotherapy would beneﬁt the oncogene-targeted treatments.

Notch system appears to be highly responsive to the modulation by its ligand. The effects included not only increased
downstream signaling but also a selective upregulation of
Notch family receptor and ligand expression in the hematopoietic organs. These results suggest the potential existence of
an autocrine ampliﬁcation loop in the Notch system, where the
initial receptor–ligand signal is further ampliﬁed via upregulation of the Notch system components. It would be clinically
important to consider such autocrine ampliﬁcation of Notch
signaling from a potential therapeutic intervention point, as
studies indicate that the effect of Notch modulation might be
dose-dependent (41, 42). Our experiments revealed that clustered DLL1 binds to all four Notch receptors. Additional investigations would be required to identify the role of each of the
receptors as well as their potential heterodimeric interaction
with the multivalent ligand in mediating the observed effects
and to determine whether they are DLL1-speciﬁc and how other
ligands modulate Notch gene expression.

Stimulation of Notch signaling with multivalent DLL1 has
signiﬁcant positive effect on T-cell–mediated antitumor immunity. It induces tumor antigen-speciﬁc IFNg production by
CD8þ T lymphocytes, increases the pool of central-memory
CD8þ T cells and enhances IFNg synthesis within central memory CD8þ T-cell population. These results imply the capacity of
DLL1 to induce effector T cells in vivo. Differentiation of T cells
into effector and memory subsets is dependent on the status of
Stat activation, including their phosphorylation. Activation of
Stat1, Stat2, Stat4, and Stat6 promotes Th1-type response,
activation of Stat5 signaling pathway drives Th2 differentiation
whereas Stat3 supports Th17 stemming in activated T cells via
inhibition of T-bet and stimulation of RORgt transcription
factor (30). The DLL1–Notch axis appears to be actively
involved in the regulation of Stat signaling by enhancing phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2. This supports Th1 proﬁle of T
cells together with the upregulation of T-bet involved in the
transcriptional effects of Stat1 on T-cell differentiation and IFNg

Multivalent DLL1 in Cancer Immunotherapy

production, but not the other transcription factors regulating Th
cell differentiation (31). Stat1 sustains CD8þ T-cell memory
pool by increasing cell survival after their antigen-speciﬁc activation (32). This explains the higher rate of CD8þ centralmemory T cells after clustered DLL1 treatment. Although clustered DLL1 also elevated Stat3 phosphorylation, alterations in
RORgt expression were marginal and not statistically signiﬁcant
in our study. Overall, the analysis of transcription factors displays prevalence of Stat1/Stat2/T-bet/Th1 nexus over the other
types of T lineage differentiation. In addition to the regulation
of T-cell differentiation, multivalent DLL1 in combination with
TCR stimulation demonstrated ability to accelerate proliferation
of T cells in human PBMC. Thus, stimulation of Notch signaling
with multivalent DLL1 could be a potent therapeutically relevant approach to promote anti-tumor Th1 and CD8þ T-cell
effector functions via modulation of the expression of transcription factors associated with T-cell differentiation, regulation of
Stat signaling, and enhanced T-cell proliferation.
Our results are in agreement with the notion that the Notch
system regulates T-cell differentiation and lineage commitment
by providing the instructive signals during the induction of
antigen-speciﬁc responses and with the fact that most gain-offunction experiments suggest that high expression of Delta-like
ligands promotes Th1 type responses (6, 7). Although somewhat
controversial, strong evidence implicated Notch1 and 2 in the
induction of antitumor immunity, including induction of tumorspeciﬁc CTL and central memory T cells (5, 43). Together with
these data, our results point to the functional axis DLL1/Notch1
and/or Notch2 as an immunotherapeutic target for activation and
validate the clinically relevant approach to effectively induce
effector T-cell differentiation and T-cell–mediated immunity critical for tumor rejection.
The strong immune stimulatory effect of pharmacologically
enhanced DLL1-mediated Notch signaling supports the concept that multivalent DLL1 could be used as a novel immunotherapeutic to induce robust immune responses, provide
effective tumor surveillance, and prolong tumor-free survival
when combined with tumor oncogene-targeted therapies. In
our studies with the erlotinib treatment of the experimental
mutant EGFR-dependent lung cancer, the hypothesis was that
the correction and stimulation of the host immune system by
Notch activation before and during the massive tumor cell
killing by EGFR inhibitor would elicit strong effector and
memory T-cell responses. This would provide signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt by immune-mediated elimination of residual and
circulating tumor cells/cancer stem cells and/or by rejection of
recurrent tumors via eliciting effective T-cell memory. Indeed,
data suggest that stronger immune responses elicited by combination treatment effectuated sustained tumor destruction
and extended the PFS.
Growing evidence shows that pleiotropic functions of
Notch can be tumor suppressive or oncogenic depending on
the cellular context in both solid tumors and hematologic
malignancies (44–46). Our data suggest the therapeutic safety
of enhancement of DLL1/Notch signaling by systemic administration of the multivalent DLL1 reagent. The experiments
with multiple human lung and mouse tumor cells demonstrated that clustered DLL1 increases neither proliferation nor
clonogenic potential of cancer cells. In vivo studies revealed
an antitumor effect of this reagent associated with decreased
tumor angiogenesis, improved T-cell differentiation and

www.aacrjournals.org

increased tumor inﬁltration by T cells and DCs. Implying
safety of the enhanced hematopoietic DLL1/Notch signaling
was our observation that mice overexpressing DLL1 in bone
marrow appeared normal and did not display any behavioral,
tissue, or hematopoietic abnormalities (21). In another study,
DLL1-mediated signaling was implicated in the inhibition of
melanoma growth due to the attenuated vascularization (37).
It is also important to note that inactivating Notch mutations
are being discovered in cancers, suggesting that the Notch
pathway could have an important tumor-suppressor role
(47). For therapeutic applications, a short-term regimen of
multivalent DLL1 might be sufﬁcient to boost immune system and induce tumor-speciﬁc immune responses. Combinations of immune stimulatory multivalent DLL1 with other
therapies associated with the release of tumor antigens holds
promise to be effective in inducing long-lasting immune
responses.
Multiple studies in recent years have called into question the
use of Notch inhibitors to treat cancer because of an increased risk
of endothelial cell tumors seen in animal models (48). Our
studies have shown that downregulation of Notch signaling in
the host may promote evasion of the immune system by tumors.
Data presented here suggest that, instead of blocking the Notch
pathway, ligand-speciﬁc and controlled restoration of the Notch
signaling would beneﬁt antitumor immunity and provide clinical
beneﬁt. These data underscore the novel role of DLL1/Notch,
most likely, Notch1 and 2 signaling in the induction of T-cell
antitumor immune responses.
Successful application of multivalent DLL1 predicted by our
studies opens a venue for exploration of a novel set of therapeutics based on the multivalent forms of Notch ligands
for modulation of Notch signaling under various pathologic
conditions.
