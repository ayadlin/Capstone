ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to determine whether autophagy and AMPK contribute
to premature senescence in auditory cells. Incubating HEI-OC1 auditory cells with
5 mM H2O2 for 1 h induced senescence, as demonstrated by senescence-associated
β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining. H2O2 treatment significantly delayed populationdoubling time, leaving cell viability unchanged. Furthermore, the proportion of
SA-β-gal-positive cells significantly increased. Autophagy-related protein expression
increased, with Atg7 and LC3-II peaking 6 h and Lamp2 peaking 24 h after H2O2
treatment. The expression of these proteins decreased 48 h after treatment.
Transmission electron microscopy revealed lipofuscin and aggregates within
autolysosomes, which accumulated markedly in the cytoplasm of HEI-OC1 cells
48 h after treatment. Akt and P70S6 phosphorylation markedly decreased after H2O2
treatment, but 4EBP1 phosphorylation significantly increased 48 h after treatment.
After RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of Atg7 and AMPK, H2O2-treated cells displayed
dense SA-β-gal staining. Also, premature senescence was significantly induced.
These suggest that a negative feedback loop may exist between autophagy and
AMPK signaling pathways in HEI-OC1 cells. In our model, oxidative stress-induced
premature senescence occurred due to impaired autophagy function through 4EBP1
phosphorylation. Our results also indicate that AMPK may regulate premature
senescence in auditory cells in an autophagy-dependent and independent manner.

division [3]. Another kind of cellular senescence is stressinduced premature senescence (SIPS), which is early
cellular senescence induced by an oncogene [4] or a variety
of stressors, such as oxidative stress or chemotherapeutic
agents [5]. SIPS occurs irrespective of telomere shortening
status. This shows that cellular senescence does not
necessarily need to unfold after extended time passage.

INTRODUCTION
Aging is a physiological phenomenon that occurs
without fail in all eukaryotes. Cellular senescence manifests
as stable cell cycle arrest with active metabolism. Cellular
senescence could also play a critical role in aging [1].
The study of cellular senescence began in 1961 when
Hayflick and Moorhead discovered that human fibroblasts
could only divide a finite number of times in culture
[2]. This phenomenon, called replicative senescence,
was subsequently determined to result from telomere
shortening due to repeated chromosome replication and

Bak-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis, which has been
demonstrated to be an important mechanism underlying
AHL in C57BL/6J mice [8]. How oxidative stress-induced
premature senescence specifically affects auditory cellular
function remains unclear.
Autophagy is an essential, homeostatic process by
which cells break down unnecessary or dysfunctional
cellular components. This evolutionarily conserved
process is characterized by the formation of double
membrane cytosolic vesicles (called autophagosomes),
which sequester cytoplasmic content and then fuse with
lysosomes [9, 10]. Autophagy enables cells to recycle
aggregated proteins and damaged organelles in the
cytoplasm that are essential for living cells to recover
from stress, such as energy depletion and oxidative and
endoplasmic reticulum stress [11–13]. In short, autophagy
plays a housekeeping role in cells.
Autophagy dysfunction has been suggested to
induce age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease
[14], cardiomyopathy [15], and hypercholesterolemia [16].
On the other hand, autophagy induction by spermidine
or through calorie restriction extends the life span of
yeast, flies, worms, mice, and human immune cells [17]
[18]. Impairing autophagy through the RNAi-mediated
knockdown of autophagy-related genes induces premature
senescence in primary human fibroblasts [19], further
underscoring the notion that autophagy plays an important
role in extending life span. Reducing calorie intake has
been shown to delay the progression of AHL [20, 21], but
the molecular mechanism underlying oxidative stressinduced autophagy and premature senescence in auditory
cells remains unclear.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an
evolutionarily conserved energy sensor that controls
nutrient sensing and energy homeostasis. AMPK affects
many aspects of cellular function, especially cellular
senescence [22]. Acute activation of AMPK also prevents
H2O2-induced premature senescence in primary human
keratinocytes [23], so AMPK could regulate cellular
senescence through oxidative stress. Alternatively, its
role in autophagy may affect cellular senescence. AMPK
regulates autophagy through two different pathways:
one involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
and the other involving the direct activation of unc51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1) [24]. Mammalian TOR is a
key regulator of autophagy and comprises two major
components, mTORC1 and mTORC2 [25]. Despite these
known functions, AMPK’s role in cellular senescence via
autophagy remains elusive in auditory cells.
In light of the above findings, we examined the
possible roles of autophagy and AMPK in oxidative
stress-induced premature senescence in auditory cells.
Conditionally immortalized mouse auditory cells, House
Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) auditory
cells [26], were incubated with a low dose of H2O2,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which induces a senescent phenotype [27]. In addition,
we examined how autophagy and AMPK impairment
affects replicative life span by using RNAi-mediated
knockdown of autophagy-related 7 (Atg7), a mediator of
autophagosome biogenesis, and AMPK in auditory cells.

RESULTS
Low dose of H2O2 induces premature senescence
in HEI-OC1 cells
Premature cellular senescence can be induced by
applying H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner [27].
To determine whether oxidative stress plays a role in
cellular senescence in auditory cells, we treated cultured
HEI-OC1 cells with different concentrations of H2O2 (2
mM or 5 mM for 1 h), washed out the H2O2 with normal
culture medium, and then incubated the cells under
permissive conditions [26]. The rate of population doubling
significantly decreased by 5 days with 5 mM H2O2, and then
by 15 days with 2 mM and 5 mM H2O2 (Figure 1A). We
confirmed that treatment with the 5 mM H2O2 for 1 h had
no effect on cell viability (Figure 1B), while continuous 5
mM H2O2 treatment significantly decreased viability within
3 to 6 h (data not shown). Since we obtained significant
changes in population doubling without affecting cell
viability with brief application of H2O2 (5 mM for 1 h), we
selected the same condition for further experiments.
Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SAβ-gal) is the most widely known biomarker of cellular
senescence [28]. We examined SA-β-gal staining in
cultured HEI-OC1 cells treated briefly with H2O2, as
described in the Methods (Cell Viability Assay section).
Phase contrast microscopy analysis showed that a
significantly increased number of SA-β-gal-positive cells
were among the H2O2-treated cells (0.00 ± 0.00% [control]
versus 6.17 ± 1.13% [treated]; n = 5, p < 0.001) (Figure
1C and 1D). Cells also exhibited marked morphological
changes, including increased cell size and change in
organelle shape, which corresponds to some of the
characteristics of senescent cells [29–32].
We further performed staining with propidium
iodide (PI) in treated and control cells to examine the
morphology of nuclei. Figure 1C shows that the nuclei
lost their sharp outlines under epifluorescence optics, and
there were changes in nuclear morphology reminiscent of
chromatin condensation 2 days after H2O2 treatment [33,
34]. PI staining revealed punctuate DNA foci in one large
nucleus. This is characteristic of cellular senescence; these
foci are termed senescence-associated heterochromatic
foci (SAHF) [35].
To examine whether cell proliferation is
attenuated under oxidative stress, we incorporated
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into cultured HEI-OC1 cells.
BrdU can be incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA
of replicating cells during the S phase of the cell cycle.

indicate that a brief treatment of H2O2 induces premature
senescence in HEI-OC1 cells without leading to cell death.

stimuli, including oxidative stress [36–38], and because
it can be regulated by H2O2 [39], we examined the
induction of autophagy in HEI-OC1 cells treated with
a low dose of H2O2. As shown in Figure 2A, Atg7 and
macrotubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3II) expression levels significantly increased, peaking 6 h
after H2O2 treatment, followed by lysosome-associated
membrane protein 2 (Lamp2) activation, which peaked
at 24 h. However, the expression of these proteins (Atg7,
LC3-II, Lamp2) decreased 48 h after treatment, indicating
that, under these brief H2O2 conditions, autophagy was
impaired at 48 h.

cells, and the resulting ratios are indicated below each blot.

To elucidate in detail the autophagic pathway
induced by the H2O2 stressor in auditory cells, we
further evaluated the mTOR cascade. Mammalian TOR
is a multidomain protein kinase that interacts with
other proteins to form two main complexes, mTORC1
and mTORC2. Mammalian TORC1 signaling impairs
autophagy [9]. Akt is an upstream regulator of mTORC1
and an effector of mTORC2, whereas S6Ks and 4EBPs
are downstream substrates of mTORC1 [40]. H2O2
treatment markedly reduced Akt phosphorylation, but
Akt expression remained the same. Phosphorylation of
P70S6 kinases (pP70S6) significantly decreased after
brief treatment with H2O2 phosphorylation of 4E-binding
protein 1 (p4EBP1) increased 48 h after treatment (Figure
2B). Taken together, these results support the idea that Akt
activity regulates only the phosphorylation of S6K1 but
not 4EBP1 in auditory cells.

round or oval double-membraned structures, containing
the same contents as autophagosomes examined in cells
prepared 6 h after treatment. Other autophagosomes
eventually appeared to merge with lysosomes to
become autolysosomes containing partially degraded
material that appeared as electron dense, unevenly
distributed dense masses (Figure 3C1). At this time,
autophagosomes and autolysosomes had accumulated
to higher concentrations in the treated cells. Figure
3C2 shows an autophagosome that appeared to form at
some ER and became an autolysosome that enveloped
damaged mitochondria. Forty-eight hours after treatment,
intact lipofuscin and aggregates within autolysosomes
accumulated markedly in the cytoplasm [41] (Figure 3D1
and 3D2). These observations support the hypothesis that
a briefly applied H2O2 impairs autophagic processes at
the ultrastructural level, appearing as soon as 48 h after
H2O2 treatment.

Impaired autophagy induces premature
senescence in HEI-OC1 cells
We next examined the relationship between
premature senescence and autophagy in HEI-OC1 cells,
which were induced by treatment with brief application of
H2O2. When Atg7 was knocked down by siRNA (Figure
4A), autophagy was successfully inhibited and LC3 levels
were attenuated, as assessed by Western blotting (Figure
4B). Expression of SA-β-gal was significantly elevated in
Atg7-depleted HEI-OC1 cells 2 days after H2O2 treatment
(1.34 ± 0.19 [control] versus 2.72 ± 0.39 [5 mM H2O2
for 1 h]; n = 3, p < 0.02), indicating its dependence
on autophagy (Figure 4C). These results suggest that
impairing autophagy induces premature senescence in
auditory cells, as assessed by SA-β-gal.

We examined ultrastructural autophagic processes
in HEI-OCI cells treated with a brief, low dose of H2O2.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that
cells in the control condition exhibited normal nuclei
with uniform and finely dispersed chromatin. Cytoplasm
in these cells also had normal appearing mitochondria
(M) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 3A). By
contrast, H2O2-treated cells had accumulated a small
number of autophagic vacuoles 6 h after treatment.
At this time, autophagosomes were round, doublemembraned structures, containing electron lucent
material and/or dense organelles (Figure 3B). Twentyfour hours after treatment, some autophagosomes were

AMPK participates in the induction of
premature senescence in HEI-OC1 cells

by autophagy through 4EBP1 and AMPK. Several lines
of evidence support this conclusion. Briefly applied
H2O2 at a low dose (5 mM for 1 h) induced premature
senescence in HEI-OC1 auditory cells in vitro. Autophagy
was detected 24 h after the brief H2O2 treatment and was
impaired 48 h after treatment. During this time, lipofuscin
and subcellular aggregates markedly accumulated in the
cytoplasm of these cells. Phosphorylation of AKt and
P70S6 decreased in a time-dependent manner, while
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 increased 48 h after H2O2
treatment. Autophagy impairment and AMPK dysfunction
led to premature senescence in these auditory cells. Taken
together, these findings provide evidence that a negative
feedback loop is present in auditory cells that includes
autophagy and AMPK signaling pathways.
To establish an auditory cell model of premature
senescence, we used low doses of H2O2 as a stressor to
induce premature senescence in HEI-OC1 auditory cells.
H2O2 has been used to induce premature senescence in
other cell types as well, such as vascular endothelial cells
[42] and keratinocytes [24]. In our system, brief H2O2
treatment resulted in delayed cell proliferation in the
absence of a remarkable decrease in cell viability (Figure
1A and 1B), suggesting that the cells underwent oxidative
stress-induced premature senescence. As shown in Figure
1C, the cytoplasm of cells displaying morphological
characteristics common to cellular senescence stained
intensely for SA-β-gal, a distinct marker of cellular
senescence. By contrast, the proportion of BrdU incorpo­
rated into newly synthesized DNA significantly decreased.
These results support the use of our system as a model
for studying premature senescence in auditory cells.
This report is the first to show that SA-β-gal is useful for
staining non-dividing, postmitotic cells like auditory cells.
In this study, we also confirmed that brief application
of H2O2 induced Atg7 expression, which peaked 6 h
after treatment (Figure 2). This correlated well with the

We further examined how AMPK contributes to
premature senescence through oxidative stress in auditory
cells. In HEI-OC1 cells knocked down with AMPKα
siRNA (Figure 5A), SA-β-gal significantly increased 2
days after H2O2 treatment (1.34 ± 0.12 [control] versus
2.39 ± 0.31 [5 mM H2O2]; n = 3, p < 0.04). This indicates
that induction of premature senescence in auditory cells
depends not only on autophagy impairment but also on
AMPK dysfunction (Figure 5B).

A negative feedback loop exists between
autophagy and AMPK signaling pathways in
HEI-OC1 cells
To better understand the relationship between
autophagy and AMPK in H2O2-induced premature
senescence in HEI-OC1 cells, we assessed AMPK
phosphorylation in H2O2-treated si-control cells and Atg7
knockdown (KD) cells, and LC3 expression in si-control
cells and AMPKα KD cells. Figure 6A shows that brief
treatment with H2O2 led to phosphorylation of AMPK in
a time-dependent manner. Knockdown of Atg7 resulted
in robust phosphorylation of AMPK, which occurred
rapidly 6 h after H2O2 treatment (Figure 6B). However,
RNAi-mediated knockdown of AMPKα decreased LC3-II
expression relative to expression in si-control cells 6 h after
treatment (5 mM, 1 h) (Figure 6C1, 6C2). These results
support the existence of a negative feedback loop between
autophagy and AMPK signaling pathways in auditory cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that oxidative stressinduced premature senescence in auditory cells is regulated

expression of LC3-II in auditory cells (Figure 2). We chose
to assess Atg7, a mediator of autophagosomal biogenesis,
because it has been demonstrated to be a viable target
through which to activate basal autophagic function in
another cell type, cardiomyocytes [43]. Moreover, genetic
deletion of Atg7 results in an overt loss of autophagy,
showing that Atg7 is necessary for processing LC3-I to
activate LC3-II and autophagosome formation [44]. Our
results suggest that autophagy is induced at an early
point in oxidative stress-induced premature senescence,
and Atg7 is important for autophagosome formation in
auditory cells and the subsequent induction of cellular
senescence.
Lamp2 induction peaked 24 h after H2O2 treatment.
Lamp2 is required for the proper fusion of lysosomes
with autophagosomes in the last stages of the autophagic
process [45]. This suggests that in auditory cells,
autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, and then become
autolysosomes within 24 h. Interestingly, the expression of
Atg7, LC3-II, and Lamp2 decreased 48 h after induction
with H2O2, indicating that autophagy function had
declined by this time. In fact, TEM revealed that a few
autophagosomes already exist in the cytoplasm as early as
6 h after treatment with low doses of H2O2. The presence
of autolysosomes was confirmed 24 h after treatment.
Also, lipofuscin and subcellular aggregates,
which accumulate heavily during aging and appear to
affect cellular function [41], increased in number in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the cytoplasm 48 h after H2O2 treatment in our model
system. This clearly indicates that autophagy was
induced by 24 h after H2O2 treatment and was impaired
48 h after treatment. It is reasonable to propose that
auditory cells progressively became dysfunctional due
to the accumulation of lipofuscin and aggregates in the
cytoplasm, reaching premature senescence at the 48-h
point in our model (Figure 7A).
We confirmed that Akt phosphorylation was
significantly decreased in our model. Low levels of
Akt phosphorylation are associated with stress-induced
senescence in endothelial cells [46]. It is well known that
Akt is a key positive regulator of mTORC1, a negative
regulator of autophagy. As shown in Figure 2B, P70S6
phosphorylation decreased in proportion to that of Akt in a
time-dependent manner, whereas 4EBP1 phosphorylation
(p4EBP1) increased independent of the Akt-mTORC1
pathway 48 h after H2O2 treatment. These results indicate
that Akt activity regulates only S6K1 in auditory cells.
Considering that in our model premature senescence was
induced 48 h after H2O2 treatment resulting in autophagy
impairment, the regulation of autophagy depends on
4EBP1. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated a possible
mTORC1-independent role for 4EBP1 in the regulation
of senescence in another model [47].
Many studies have shown that autophagy activation
mediates the extension of life span [18, 48]. Conversely,
it has been reported that autophagy impairment induces

premature senescence in primary human fibroblasts [49].
In the present study, RNAi-mediated knockdown of
Atg7 efficiently led to autophagy impairment in auditory
cells. There were a significant proportion of senescent
cells among H2O2-treated Atg7 KD cells (Figure 4C).
These findings indicate that autophagy impairment due
to decreased Atg7 expression may be responsible for
premature senescence in auditory cells. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to demonstrate that reduction of Atg7
induces premature senescence in auditory cells.
We also investigated the effects of AMPK on
H2O2-induced premature senescence in auditory
cells, because AMPK regulates cell survival during
stress and coordinates signaling of many age-related
transcription factor pathways. A recent study indicates
that acute activation of AMPK prevents H2O2-induced
premature senescence in primary human keratinocytes
[24]. In our present study, as expected, there was a
significantly increased number of densely SA-β-gal
stained senescent cells among the H2O2-treated Atg7
KD cells (Figure 5B). AMPK activation upregulates
antioxidant mechanisms that diminish H2O2 [50], while
AMPK knockdown increases oxidative stress in 3T3L1
adipocytes [51]. Therefore, the increased number of
SA-β-gal positive cells we observed after AMPK KD
could be due to oxidative stress. This suggests that
another possible mechanism may exist in auditory cells
for AMPK regulation of premature senescence through
oxidative stress. Indeed, we observed that AMPK
phosphorylation (i.e., AMPK activation) increased in
a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum 48 h
after H2O2 treatment. This finding indicates that, in turn,
AMPK activation upregulates antioxidant mechanisms,
since premature senescence was reliably observable in
our model 48 h after brief H2O2 treatment. Therefore,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these apparently conflicting findings indicate that the
mechanism in auditory cells—premature senescence
regulation through AMPK—could involve regulation of
oxidative stress.
AMPK also plays a role as a key activator of the
signaling network that maintains cellular housekeeping
by autophagy [52, 53]. AMPK usually stimulates
autophagy by inhibiting mTOR, but also by directly
phosphorylating ULK1 (mammalian homolog of
yeast and fly Atg1) [54, 55]. In fact, RNAi-mediated
knockdown of AMPKα reduced the expression of LC3II to less than si-control. However, knockdown of
Atg7 leads to the early induction of pAMPK 6 h after
treatment. This result indicates AMPK activity could be
negatively regulated by Atg7 in auditory cells. Namely,
there is a negative feedback loop between autophagy and
AMPK pathways in auditory cells (Figure 7B).
In summary, we confirmed that impaired
autophagic processes induce oxidative stress-related
premature senescence in our auditory cellular premature
senescence model. Autophagy was impaired through the
phosphorylation of 4EBP1. We also found that autophagy
impairment and AMPK dysfunction induced premature
senescence in auditory cells. Taken together, these results
indicate that AMPK regulates premature senescence in an
autophagy-dependent and independent manner. Our results
provide significant insights into the role of autophagy
(thorough 4EBP1 and AMPK) in oxidative stressinduced premature senescence of auditory cells. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to show the association
between premature senescence and autophagy in auditory
cells. However, further studies need to be conducted to
determine how senescence and autophagy affect auditory
cellular function and contribute to pathology underlying
hearing impairments.

METHODS

Cell viability assay

Regents and antibodies

HEI-OC1 auditory cells (5 × 104 cells/ml/well of
24-well plates) were incubated with one of two different
concentrations of H2O2 (2 or 5 mM), dissolved in the
control medium listed in the cell culture and culture
condition section for 1 h, and then the H2O2 solution was
replaced with culture medium lacking H2O2. Control
cells were also prepared similarly except without H2O2.
To determine viability, the cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested from the
flasks via trypsinization (0.25w/v% trypsin-1 mmol/l
EDTA, for 2 min.), resuspended in PBS, and diluted 1:1
in 0.4% trypan blue solution. Cell viability was calculated
with a Countess® Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen,
Life Technologies, USA), following the manufacturer’s
suggested procedures.

Hydrogen peroxide was purchased from Wako
(Wako, Osaka, Japan). The following primary antibodies
were purchased from Cell signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA): anti-Atg7, anti-pP70S6, anti-p4EBP1, ­antiAMPKα, anti-pAMPKα. Anti-LC3, anti-Lamp2, and
anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA); Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
(Dallas, TX, USA); and BD Biosciences (San Jose,
CA, USA), respectively. Anti-mouse and –rabbit HRPlinked secondary antibodies were from GE Healthcare
(Buckinghamshire, UK). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
for Atg7, AMPK, and control siRNA were from Cell
Signaling Technology. Propidium iodide (PI) solution was
also from Cell Signaling Technology. Bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) and anti-BrdU (Bu20a) antibody were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology. FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody was from Life Technologies (Carlsbad,
CA, USA).

Measurement of population doublings
To determine the rate of population doublings in
HEI-OC1 cells, we used a slightly modified method, as
previously described [28]. Cell numbers were counted
at the indicated intervals (2 or 3 days for control and 2
mM-H2O2, and 5 days for 5 mM-H2O2 group) using a
hemocytometer, and then the cells were seeded again
in preparation for the next count. The numbers were
converted into population doublings according to the
following formula: [log (No. of cells counted) - log (No.
of cell plated)]/log (2).

Cell culture and culture conditions
HEI-OC1 auditory cells were kindly provided by
Dr. D. Lim (House Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA,
USA). This conditionally immortalized mouse auditory
cell line was established by Kalinec et al. [27], and is a
well-established in vitro system for investigating cellular
and molecular mechanisms. Cells were maintained in
low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified medium (DMEM;
Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, UT, USA), 1% penicillin
streptomycin, and 1% kanamycin (MP Biomedicals,
Ohio, USA) at 33°C in a humidified incubator with
10% CO2. This culturing medium also served as the
control medium in the population doubling experiments.
Maintaining HEI-OC1 cells at this temperature and CO2
concentration is referred to as “permissive conditions” by
Kalinec et al. [27], because lower basal apoptotic rates
are present.

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)
staining
SA-β-gal staining in HEI-OC1 cells was performed
using a Senescence Cells Histochemical Staining
Kit® (Sigma-Aldrich), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. As above, HEI-OC1 cells were incubated
with 5 mM H2O2 for 1 h, and then the H2O2 solution was
replaced with culture medium lacking H2O2. Cultured cells
were washed with PBS, fixed with Fixative Buffer for 6–7
min, washed again with PBS, and then incubated with the
kit’s Staining Mixture overnight at 37°C in a humidified
incubator without the added 10% CO2 mixture (i.e., 100%
ambient room air). Then undiluted PI solution was added
for staining DNA contents in nuclei. Cells were observed
with an inverted fluorescence phase-contrast microscope
(BioZero BZ-8100 All-In-One Fluorescence Microscope,
Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Cells with blue staining in the
cytoplasm were scored as positive. To quantify positive
staining, more than 100 cells were counted for each
sample in duplicate experiments.
Quantitative analysis of fluorescent SA-β-gal staining
was carried out using a 96-well Cellular Senescence
Assay Kit® (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
First, we briefly washed the cells with 1 × PBS and added

Transient siRNA transfection
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Atg7
(Sigma-Aldrich), AMPK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.), and control siRNA (Cell Signaling Technology) were
used for knockdown of the Atg7 and AMPK1/2 genes.
HEI-OC1 cells were seeded in 25 cm2 flasks and cultured
overnight to achieve 90–95% confluency. Cells were then
mechanically scraped from the flasks and transfected with
siRNAs using a Gene Pulser electroporation system (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Two days after transfection, cells were either
treated with H2O2 or remained untreated and then prepared
for Western blot analysis (see below).

1X lysis buffer. After centrifuging the cell lysate for 10
min, the supernatant was collected, and the total protein
concentration of each cell lysate sample was determined
using a Nanodrop® spectrophotometer (Model #1000,
Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA). The lysate was mixed
with the manufacturer’s Assay buffer containing 5% SAβ-gal solution, and then incubated at 37°C protected from
ambient room light for 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped
by adding the manufacturer’s Stop solution. SA-β-gal
fluorescence was detected and measured with a fluorescence
plate reader at 360 nm (excitation wavelength) / 465 nm
(emission wavelength).

Antibodies section) at dilutions of 1:200–1:1000 in Can
Get Signal® solution (TOYOBO, Japan). After 3 washes
with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with the
corresponding species-appropriate secondary antibody
at a dilution of 1:5000 in Can Get Signal® solution, and
developed with Immunostar (Wako, Osaka, Japan).

Transmission electron microscopy
HEI-OC1 cells were harvested by trypsinization, and
then were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h followed by 1% osmium
tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for
2 h. To enhance contrast for TEM, samples were en-bloc
stained with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight and then
dehydrated by alcohols at 4°C and infiltrated with a graded
series of Epon/Araldite mixture, followed by embedding in
100% Epon/Araldite. Thin sections (70 nM) were cut with
a diamond knife, mounted on EM grids, and stained with
Reynolds’ lead citrate solution, washed, dried, and imaged
using a FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope
(Field Emission Incorporated, Hillsboro, Oregon, U.S.A.).

BrdU incorporation and detection
HEI-OC1 cells were seeded onto 35 mm dishes,
and BrdU incorporation was conducted by adding diluted
BrdU in warmed culture medium to a final concentration
of 0.03 mg/ml and incubated for 30 min. After aspirating
this media, cells were fixed by covering the cell layer
with 70% ethanol for 5 min, thoroughly washed in
PBS, and then incubated in 1.5 M HCl for 30 min. Cells
were then incubated in a mixture of 5% (wt/vol) normal
goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, and
then incubated overnight at 4°C in anti-BrdU primary
antibody (1:1400) diluted in PBS and 1% BSA. After
washing thoroughly in PBS, cells were incubated in
FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h in the dark
and counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). The cells were washed thoroughly in PBS and
observed with an all-in-one epifluorescence microscope
(BioZero BZ-8100, Keyence). Cell counts were done
at 60 × magnification. Cells with positive nuclear
staining were scored as positively incorporating BrdU.
To quantify positive staining, more than 100 cells were
counted for each sample in duplicate.

Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as means ±S.D. Statistical
analysis was carried out by using one-way analysis of
variance and Student’s t tests. P values less than 0.05 were
considered to indicate statistical significance.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank Drs. Federico Kalinec (UCLA, Los
Angeles, CA, USA) for providing HEI-OC1 auditory
cells, Toyoharu Jike (Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan)
for technical assistance, and Tomoko Muraki for cell
preparation. We acknowledge Grant in aid from the
Takeda science foundation (SK).

Protein extraction and Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as follows.
HEI-OC1 cell samples were trypsinized for 2 min and
homogenized in 20 mM HEPES, containing 1% Triton
X-100. Once homogenized, cell extracts were centrifuged
at 10,000 rpm at 4°C and supernatants were collected.
The protein concentration of the supernatant was
evaluated with a Nanodrop® spectrophotometer (Nanodrop
Technologies). An equal volume of 2 × SDS sample
buffer was added to the samples, and the samples were
then boiled for 3 min. Samples (25 μg) were subjected
to electrophoresis on 10–12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels
for 60–80 min at 40mA and then transferred onto PVDF
membranes using iBlot® (Invitrogen). The membranes
were incubated overnight at 4°C in 5% (wt/vol) dried
milk protein or 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin in
TBS containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween-20 (TBS-T),
washed in TBS-T, and then incubated overnight at 4°C
in the presence of primary antibodies (see Reagents and
