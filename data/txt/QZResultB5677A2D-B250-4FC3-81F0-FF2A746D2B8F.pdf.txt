ABSTRACT
Background: Patients with stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma were reported
to benefit from adding cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy to two-dimensional
conventional radiotherapy. But this benefit becomes uncertain in the intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) era, owing to its significant advantage.
Methods: We enrolled 661 low risk (T1N1M0, T2N0-1M0 or T3N0M0, the 2010
UICC/AJCC staging system) patients who underwent IMRT with or without concurrent
chemotherapy. Particularly, patients with IMRT alone or IMRT plus cisplatin-based
concurrent chemotherapy were equally matched using propensity-score matching
method. Overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and
locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS) were assessed with Kaplan-Meier method,
log-rank test and Cox regression.
Results: Among 661 patients, IMRT alone achieved parallel OS (P = 0.379),
DMFS (P = 0.169) and LRFS (P = 0.849) to IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy.
In the propensity-matched cohort of 482 patients, similar survival were observed
between both arms (4-years OS 97.4% vs 96.1%, P = 0.134; DMFS 96.5% vs 95.1%,
P = 0.763; LRFS 93.8% vs 91.5%, P = 0.715). In multivariate analysis, cisplatinbased concurrent chemotherapy did not lower the risk of death, distant metastasis
or locoregional relapse. And this association remained unchanged in subgroups by
age, sex, histology and stage.
Conclusions: In this study, low risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who
underwent IMRT could not benefit from cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy.

survival benefit from the combined treatment of cisplatinbased concurrent chemotherapy and two-dimensional
conventional radiotherapy (2DCRT) for patients with stage
II (the Chinese 1992 staging system) of this disease [4].
However, since intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
was known to be superior to 2DCRT in local control [5],
it is a pivotal question whether patients in low risk of

INTRODUCTION

relatively rare in Europe and the United States [1] but
highly endemic in Southern China [2] and Hong Kong

relapse, distant metastasis or death [e.g. T1N1M0, T2N01M0 or T3N0M0, based on the 2010 International Union
against Cancer/ American Joint Committee on Cancer
(UICC/AJCC) staging system] can still obtain significant
benefit from the additional concurrent chemotherapy
in the IMRT era. Unfortunately, there is no convincing
evidence from any large scale completed randomized
controlled trial, due to the low incidence of NPC in most
area, the small proportion of patients with early stage,
and the recent application of IMRT in the endemic area.
To address this question, we retrospectively analyzed
data of 661 patients with stage T1N1M0, T2N0-1M0 or
T3N0M0 who received IMRT with or without concurrent
chemotherapy. We especially compared the survival
outcomes of IMRT alone with IMRT plus cisplatin-based
concurrent chemotherapy in a propensity score matched
cohort, which was likely to mimic randomized trials
[6]. This shall provide valuable support for treatment
guidelines and suggestion for the future randomized
controlled trials.

In the propensity-matched cohort of 482 patients,
the median follow-up time was 50.7 months (10.9–
138.0 months) for the IMRT alone arm and 47.6 months
(10.0–138.0 months) for the IMRT plus cisplatin-based
concurrent chemotherapy arm, respectively. In univariate
analysis, IMRT alone resulted in parallel survival to
IMRT plus cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy (OS
rates at 4-years 97.4% vs 96.1%, P = 0.134; DMFS rates
at 4 years 96.5% vs 95.1%, P = 0.763; and LRFS rates
at 4 years 93.8% vs 91.5%, P = 0.715; Figure 2A–2C).
In multivariate analysis, IMRT alone was also highly
comparable to IMRT plus cisplatin-based concurrent
chemotherapy in risk of death, locoregional relapse and
distant metastasis. (Table 2).
In subgroup analysis by age (<45/ ≥ 45 years), sex
and histology in the propensity-matched cohort, IMRT
alone showed no significant survival differences from
IMRT plus cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy.
In separate subgroup of stage T1N1M0, T2N0M0 and
T2N1M0 (stage II), IMRT alone led to similar survival
to IMRT plus cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy,
independent of other covariates. With restriction to
patients with stage T3N0M0 (stage III), the effect of
cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy on OS, DMFS
and LRFS was also independently insignificant. (Table 3).

RESULTS
Patients
A total of 661 patients were entered into this study.
Initially, 254 (38.4%) and 407 (61.6%) patients were
treated with IMRT alone and IMRT plus concurrent
chemotherapy, respectively. Following propensity score
matching, 241 patients treated with IMRT alone and
241 patients treated with IMRT plus cisplatin-based
concurrent chemotherapy remained in the analysis. The
matched patients in both arms had balanced characteristics
(Table 1). The average dose of cisplatin delivered in the
propensity-matched cohort was about 175 mg/m2.

Hematological toxicities
In the propensity-matched cohort, cisplatin-based
concurrent chemotherapy significantly increased the
incidence of grade 1–2 leucopenia, neutropenia, anemia
and thrombocytopenia, and grade 3–4 leucopenia and
neutropenia. (Table 4)

DISCUSSION

Survival outcomes

The most appealing finding of this large scale
propensity score matched study is that the addition of
cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy to IMRT did
not lower the risk of death, locoregional relapse or distant
metastasis in stage T1N1M0, T2N0-1M0 and T3N0M0
NPC.
Concurrent chemotherapy is recommended as
the standard additional treatment to radiotherapy for
NPC patients except for those with stage T1N0M0
disease by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN). As locoregionally advanced NPC has high
risk of locoregional relapse and distant metastasis, the
addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy can
improve survival via the eradication of micrometastasis
and enhancement of radiosensitivity [7–13]. It seems
reasonable for the recommendation of radiotherapy plus
concurrent chemotherapy to stage II NPC patients by
the NCCN, according to the result of a recent study by
Chen et al [4]. However, all the included patients in that

In the original unmatched cohort of 661 patients,
the median follow-up time was 51.2 months (10.9–
138.0 months) for the IMRT alone arm and 46.7 months
(10.0–138.0 months) for the IMRT plus concurrent
chemotherapy arm, respectively. Overall, 4-years overall
survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)
and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS) rates
did not differ significantly between the two arms (OS
97.5% vs 95.8%, P = 0.379; DMFS 97.3% vs 94.8%,
P = 0.169; and LRFS 94.1% vs 93.4%, P = 0.849; Figure
1A–1C). Accounting for age (continuous), sex, titers of
immunoglobulin A against viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgA,
< 80/80–320/ ≥ 320) and early antigen (EA-IgA, < 10/10–
40/ ≥ 40), T-stage and N-stage in multivariate analysis,
IMRT alone was not associated with higher risk of death,
locoregional relapse or distant metastasis than IMRT plus
concurrent chemotherapy. (Table 2).

local tumor control, especially in the early T-stage patients

improvement of LRFS [14]. Thus it is less likely to
achieve survival gain from concurrent chemotherapy when
IMRT has significantly improved the locoregional control.
In the IMRT era, Tham et al [15] attempted to justify
the omission of chemotherapy in 107 patients with stage
IIb (the 1997 AJCC staging system). The comparable
survival rates between patients with and without
any chemotherapy strategies (including abbreviated
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy
and adjuvant chemotherapy) indicated that IMRT alone
might be sufficient treatment for this particular subgroup
of patients. The insignificant differences in any survival
endpoints between patients with and without concurrent
chemotherapy also supported the plausibility of IMRT
alone, albeit that only eight (7.5%) patients in that study
received concurrent chemotherapy. Conversely, a most
recent study by Kang et al [16] observed benefit from
concurrent chemotherapy to stage II (the 2002 UICC/
AJCC staging system) NPC in locoregional control and
progression-free survival, but not DMFS or OS. Of note,
among the 41 patients without concurrent chemotherapy
(seven patients received induction chemotherapy
and  one patients received adjuvant chemotherapy), 37
(90.2%) patients underwent three-dimensional conformal
radiotherapy or IMRT, but they only achieved a 5-years
LRFS of 66.6%, which was quite lower than the reported
5-years LRFS rate of 94.2% resulting from IMRT alone in
the study by Su et al [17], and even similar to the 5-years
LRFS of locoregionally advanced NPC treated with
2DCRT alone [8, 12].
So it was not absurd regarding the insignificant
survival differences between IMRT alone and IMRT
plus concurrent chemotherapy for low risk NPC in our
study. Certainly, the average dose of cisplatin delivered
in concurrent chemotherapy was lower than 200 mg/m2.
Thus further prospective studies are warranted to confirm
whether this should be responsible for the observed
insignificant effect, as retrospective studies suggested
that cumulative dose of cisplatin over 200 mg/m2 resulted
in better OS in stage IIb and III (the 2002 UICC/AJCC
staging system) patients who received 2DCRT or IMRT
[18]. Possibly, concurrent chemotherapy with other more
efficacious regimen might improve the survival. For
instance, the induction regimen of taxanes (docetaxel
or paclitaxel) plus cisplatin and fluorouracil (PF) was
superior to PF alone in head and neck cancer [19–22]
and neoadjuvant docetaxel and cisplatin significantly
improved OS of advanced NPC when comparing to
chemoradiotherapy alone [23]. Thus taxanes-based
concurrent chemotherapy might be a potentially
effective alternative [24, 25]. Additionally, concurrent
chemotherapy with small molecular targeted drugs
such as endostar (e.g., NCT02237924), nimotuzumab
(e.g., NCT01074021) and bevacizumab [26] deserved
further investigation in early stage patients. Despite the
fact that these patients staged with T1N1M0, T2N0www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

1M0 or T3N0M0 usually have low risk of relapse and
distant metastasis on the whole, selecting patients using
molecular biomarkers [e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
copy number of the Epstein-Barr virus] might be a valid
approach to better survival.
Obviously, the treatment outcomes from the current
study were higher than those from RTOG 0225 [27] and
MSKCC [28] studies, but comparable to those from
the similar early stage NPC study by Su et al [17]. The
differences in tumor stage most possibly resulted in the
big gap of survival between these studies. Specifically,
58.9% and 77% of patients included in RTOG 0225 and
MSKCC studies were staged III and IV, respectively.
These locoregionally advanced disease undoubtedly had
low survival rate. Inversely, stage II patients had a 5-year
OS rate of 85.8% and 5-year PFS rate of 77.8% when
receiving 2DCRT without chemotherapy [4], and even
achieved a 5-year disease specific survival rate of 97.3%
from IMRT alone [17]. Secondly, only 33.8% of patients
in RTOG 0225 (32% in MSKCC study) were Asian,
and over 40% (35% in MSKCC study) of patients were
diagnosed with WHO I/II histology. The differences in
ethnicity and histology may also contribute to the survival
disparities. For example, the 3-year OS rate was 90% in
a report from Hong Kong [29], which was much higher
than the 2-year OS rate of 80.2% in RTOG 0225. Finally,
the small number of patients in RTOG 0225 and MSKCC
study possibly caused the skewed results as well.
The major strength of this study lies in the investigation
of concurrent chemotherapy effect in low risk NPC in the
IMRT era with the largest sample size using propensity score
matching and multivariate analysis. This greatly addressed
the limitations of divergent confounders and selection bias
associated with the retrospective assessment of observational
data [30]. Of course, the unobserved differences between
the two arms cannot be balanced or adjusted. Although
the presented data was derived from a single institution in
endemic area with expertise in diagnosing and treating this
disease, it did provide the most convincing evidence before
the final report of any phase 3 randomized controlled trial.
Since data on DNA copy number of the Epstein-Barr virus
was missing in most of cases, VCA-IgA and EA-IgA were
taken as the surrogate.
The major limitation is the missing data on acute
non-hematological and late toxicities because of the
retrospective design and the long time span between the
first and the last included case. The recorded hematological
toxicities might also be inaccurate due to the absence
of strict and regular detection during treatment. But the
additional toxicity from concurrent chemotherapy and
similar toxicity from IMRT in the two arms were expected.
Owing to the low sensitivity rate of chest radiography
compared with chest computed tomography (CT), some
patients might be delayed in detecting lung metastasis and
have falsely high DMFS rate as a consequence. But the
intrinsic differences in DMFS might scarcely change, as
44026

the chance of delay was equal to patients in both arms.
Another limitation caused by the retrospective design
was the heterogeneity of chemotherapy regimens and
doses, albeit we restricted to patients with cisplatin-based
concurrent chemotherapy in the propensity-matched
cohort. Yet this phenomenon was the exact representation
of the clinical reality out of randomized controlled trials.
Additionally, it was possible that patients in the IMRT
alone arm had smaller tumor volume, for the absence of
matching this characteristic because of the unavailable data
in many cases. But importantly, prior study [31] indicated
that the pretreatment tumor volume had limited prognostic
value in early stage NPC compared with the usual T-stage
and N-stage. Even though great tumor volume showed
association with greater risk of local failure, this might be
possibly compromised by the improved local control from
IMRT [5]. Further prospective studies are warranted.
In conclusion, this propensity-matched study
indicated no significant survival benefit from adding
cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy to IMRT for low
risk NPC with stage T1N1M0, T2N0-1M0 or T3N0M0.
Further confirmation by prospectively randomized
controlled trial is ongoing.

Patients were examined every 3–6 months during
the first 3 years, and every 6–12 months thereafter
until death. During this period, patients were assessed
by history and physical examination and a series of
conventional examination equipment (e.g., fiberoptic
nasopharyngoscopy, MRI of the nasopharynx and neck,
and distant metastastic work-up if indicated.) at each
follow-up visit, to detect the possible relapse or distant
metastasis. Local relapses were confirmed by biopsy, MRI
scan, or both. Regional relapses were diagnosed by clinical
examination and MRI scan of the neck and, in doubtful
cases, by fine needle aspiration of the lymph nodes.
Distant metastases were diagnosed by clinical symptoms,
physical examinations, and imaging methods including
chest radiography or CT, Tc-99-MDP whole-body bones
scan or CT/MRI of bones, and abdominal sonography
or CT. Patients without recent examination tests in the
medical records were followed up by telephone call.

Statistical analysis
To reduce the interference of treatment heterogeneity,
only 306 patients treated with IMRT plus cisplatin-based
concurrent chemotherapy were selected to match those
treated with IMRT alone using propensity score matching
method. This method creates similar case (IMRT alone)
and control (IMRT plus cisplatin-based concurrent
chemotherapy) arms with balanced but not equal
characteristics, and reduces possible biases to a minimum
in a retrospective analysis [30]. Propensity scores were
computed by logistic regression for each patient based
on the following covariates, age, sex, histology (WHO
II, differentiated non-keratinising carcinoma; WHO III,
undifferentiated non-keratinising carcinoma [33]), titers
of VCA-IgA and EA-IgA, T-stage, N-stage and clinical
stage. Patients were then matched without replacement at
the ratio of 1:1 on those scores, rather than the individual
covariates. Covariates balance between the two sets
were examined by t test (continuous variable), χ2 test
(categorical variable) and standardized difference [34] for
the original unmatched and propensity-matched cohorts.
OS (time from treatment to death from any cause),
DMFS (time from treatment to the first distant metastasis)
and LRFS (time from treatment to the first locoregional
relapse) were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method
[35] and compared with log-rank test. Adjusted hazard
ratios with 95% confidence intervals (with IMRT plus
cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy as reference)
were calculated using Cox proportional hazards model [36].
In the propensity-matched cohort, survival curves were
compared using stratified log-rank test by matched pairs,
and hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional
hazards model with a robust variance estimator to account
for the clustering within matched pairs [37]. Toxicities in

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between March 2003 and February 2013, 661 biopsyproven, non-metastatic and treatment-naïve NPC patients
who were at the age of 20 or above were entered into this
study. All patients had complete pretreatment evaluation
including patient history, physical examination, hematology
and biochemistry profiles, fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy
with biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
nasopharynx and neck, chest radiography or CT, abdominal
sonography or CT, and Technetium-99m-methylene
diphosphonate (Tc-99-MDP) whole-body bone scan or
CT/MRI of bones. All the 661 patients were restaged with
T1N1M0, T2N0-1M0 or T3N0M0 in accordance with the
2010 UICC/AJCC staging system for NPC.

Treatment
All patients were treated by definitive IMRT with or
without concurrent chemotherapy. The cumulative radiation
doses were 66 Gy or greater to the primary tumor, 60–66
Gy to the involved cervical lymph nodes and 50 Gy or
greater to potential sites of local infiltration and bilateral
cervical lymphatics in 30–33 fractions. Further details of
the radiation technique have been described previously [32].
Concurrent chemotherapy mainly consisted of 80–100 mg/m2
cisplatin- or nedaplatin-based regimen given every three
weeks for two to three cycles, or 30–40 mg/m2 cisplatin- or
nedaplatin-based regimen or 20–30 mg/m2 docetaxel-based
regimen given weekly for up to seven cycles.
