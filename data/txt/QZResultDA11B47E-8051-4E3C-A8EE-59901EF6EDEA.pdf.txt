Abstract

Author Manuscript

Despite the high prevalence and poor outcome of patients with metastatic lung cancer, the
mechanisms of tumour progression and metastasis remain largely uncharacterized. We modelled
human lung adenocarcinoma, which frequently harbours activating point mutations in KRAS1 and
inactivation of the p53-pathway2, using conditional alleles in mice3–5. Lentiviral-mediated
somatic activation of oncogenic Kras and deletion of p53 in the lung epithelial cells of
KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53flox/flox mice initiates lung adenocarcinoma development4. Although tumours
are initiated synchronously by defined genetic alterations, only a subset become malignant,
suggesting that disease progression requires additional alterations. Identification of the lentiviral

integration sites allowed us to distinguish metastatic from non-metastatic tumours and determine
the gene expression alterations that distinguish these tumour types. Cross-species analysis
identified the NK-2 related homeobox transcription factor Nkx2-1 (Ttf-1/Titf1) as a candidate
suppressor of malignant progression. In this mouse model, Nkx2-1-negativity is pathognomonic of
high-grade poorly differentiated tumours. Gain-and loss-of-function experiments in cells derived
from metastatic and non-metastatic tumours demonstrated that Nkx2-1 controls tumour
differentiation and limits metastatic potential in vivo. Interrogation of Nkx2-1 regulated genes,
analysis of tumours at defined developmental stages, and functional complementation experiments
indicate that Nkx2-1 constrains tumours in part by repressing the embryonically-restricted
chromatin regulator Hmga2. While focal amplification of NKX2-1 in a fraction of human lung
adenocarcinomas has focused attention on its oncogenic function6–9, our data specifically link
Nkx2-1 downregulation to loss of differentiation, enhanced tumour seeding ability, and increased
metastatic proclivity. Thus, the oncogenic and suppressive functions of Nkx2-1 in the same
tumour type substantiate its role as a dual function lineage factor.

We developed lentiviral vectors that express Cre-recombinase (Lenti-Cre)10 and determined
the dose that results in 5 to 20 lung tumours per KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53flox/flox mouse after
intratracheal administration. These mice lived 8–14 months after tumour initiation and
developed macroscopic metastases to the draining lymph nodes, pleura, kidneys, heart,
adrenal glands, and liver (Supplementary Fig. 1). Because lentiviruses integrate stably into
the genome, the integration site was a unique molecular identifier that unambiguously linked
primary tumours to their related metastases (Fig. 1a). We used linker-mediated PCR (LMPCR) to determine the genomic sequence directly 3′ of the integrated lentiviral genome
followed by a specific PCR for the lentiviral integration site (Fig. 1b). To have samples of
sufficient quantity and purity for our analyses, we derived cell lines from primary tumours
and metastases. Cell lines were pure tumour cells as determined by recombination of the
p53floxed alleles (data not shown). The clonal relationship of these cell lines was established
using LM-PCR or Southern blot analysis for the lentiviral genome (Fig. 1c and data not
shown). We termed cell lines derived from verified metastatic primary lung tumours TMet.

Author Manuscript

Gene expression profiling was performed on cell lines from twenty-three lung tumours and
metastases (nine metastases, seven TMet primary tumours, and seven potentially nonmetastatic primary tumours). Using unsupervised consensus clustering11, we identified four
cell lines from likely non-metastatic tumour samples that had highly concordant gene
expression and were separate from all TMet and metastasis (Met) samples (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Therefore, we surmised that these could represent non-metastatic primary tumours
and classified them as TnonMet. These TnonMet cell lines consistently formed fewer tumour
nodules in the liver after intrasplenic injection despite equivalent proliferation rates in cell
culture (Fig. 1d–e and Supplementary Fig. 2).
Significant gene expression alterations distinguished TnonMet from TMet and Met-derived
cell lines (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 1), many of which were validated by qRT-PCR,
flow cytometry, and western blotting (data not shown). A gene expression signature
generated by comparing TnonMet to TMet/Met samples predicted patient outcome in human
lung adenocarcinoma gene expression datasets12,13, suggesting the possibility of

evolutionarily-conserved molecular mechanisms of tumour progression (Supplementary Fig.
2). Thus, we integrated mouse and human data by comparing the differences in expression
between TnonMet and TMet/Met samples with the association of human gene expression and
patient survival (Fig. 2a). Two genes were particularly notable from this analysis: the NKrelated homeobox transcription factor Nkx2-1 and the Nkx2-1 target gene surfactant protein
B (Sftpb; Fig. 2a). Nkx2-1 regulates lung development and is expressed in Type II
pneumocytes and bronchiolar cells in the adult14–16. Nkx2-1 expression was >10-fold
higher in TnonMet samples, and higher NKX2-1 expression in human tumours correlated with
longer survival. Of note, NKX2-1 is focally amplified in ~10% of human lung
adenocarcinoma, with functional data supporting oncogenic activity6–9,17. Conversely,
most immunohistochemical analyses of NKX2-1 in this disease suggest an association
between NKX2-1-negative tumours and poor patient outcome17,18. Thus, we focused on
validating and characterizing the function of this transcription factor in suppressing tumour
progression and metastasis.

We confirmed reduced Nkx2-1 mRNA and protein in TMet and Met cell lines without
evidence of focal genomic loss of this region (Fig. 2b, Supplemental Fig. 4, and data not
shown). Nkx2-1 was consistently downregulated in high-grade poorly differentiated tumours
from our mouse model (Fig. 2c–e and Supplementary Fig. 3). Nkx2-1 expression was also
reduced in advanced KrasG12D-driven lung adenocarcinomas with p53R270H or p53R172H
point mutations4,19. Using our LM-PCR assay, we identified three primary lung tumours as
metastatic based on the presence of metastases with the same lentiviral integration site (Fig.
1b and data not shown). These tumours each contained poorly-differentiated areas that were
Nkx2-1neg (Supplementary Fig. 6). Interestingly, Nkx2-1 expression was low/absent in
almost all lymph node and distant macrometastases, though some micrometastases were
Nkx2-1pos or Nkx2-1mixed (Supplementary Fig. 3). Whether certain micrometastases were
seeded by Nkx2-1pos cells or reverted to an Nkx2-1pos phenotype due to cues from their new
environment is unknown.
In human lung adenocarcinoma12,13 the expression of NKX2-1 correlated with a mouse
TnonMet gene expression signature (Supplementary Fig. 3). Additionally, the TnonMet
signature was anti-correlated with an embryonic stem cell signature, supporting the notion
that TMet/Met cells have transitioned to a less differentiated and more stem-like state20
(Supplementary Fig. 3).

The correlative mouse and human data were consistent with Nkx2-1 being either a marker or
a functional regulator of tumour progression. Nkx2-1 expression in a TMet cell line greatly
suppressed tumour formation after intravenous transplantation (Fig. 3a, 3b, and
Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, of the tumours that formed after injection of TMet-Nkx2-1
cells, many were either Nkx2-1neg or Nkx2-1mixed (Fig. 3c). In general, tumours that
continued to express Nkx2-1 were well-differentiated, while Nkx2-1neg tumours often
displayed solid architecture or areas of poorly-differentiated cells (Fig. 3d and
Supplementary Fig. 5). Intrasplenic transplantation unveiled a similar diminution of tumour
formation by TMet–Nkx2-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). Nkx2-1 expression did not alter
proliferation or cell death in cell culture, or affect established tumour proliferation in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. 5 and data not shown), but dramatically reduced the ability of these

cells to grow in anchorage-independent conditions and initiate tumours after subcutaneous
transplantation (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 5)

Author Manuscript

To further elucidate the function of Nkx2-1, we knocked-down Nkx2-1 in TnonMet cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Nkx2-1 knockdown allowed the formation of more liver nodules
after intrasplenic injection and more lung nodules after intravenous transplantation (Fig. 3f).
Nkx2-1 knockdown did not alter proliferation or cell death in cell culture (Supplementary
Fig. 7) but enhanced the cells’ ability to form colonies under anchorage-independent
conditions and tumours after subcutaneous transplantation (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig.
7). Reexpression of an shRNA-insensitive Nkx2-1 cDNA (Nkx2-1*) reverted the phenotypic
alterations elicited by shNkx2-1 confirming that the effects of the shNkx2-1 were specifically
due to Nkx2-1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 7). Finally, we induced tumours in
KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53flox/flox mice with either Lenti-Cre or a lentiviral vector expressing both
Nkx2-1 and Cre (Lenti-Nkx2-1/Cre). Expression of exogenous Nkx2-1 limited tumour
progression resulting in fewer tumours of advanced histopathological grades (Fig. 3g).

Author Manuscript

To discover Nkx2-1 regulated genes, we compared gene expression in TnonMet and TnonMet–
shNkx2-1 cells. Overlapping this gene list with the genes expressed at different levels in
TnonMet versus TMet/Met cells uncovered high priority candidate genes (Supplementary Fig.
8). We elected to focus on Hmga2 given its role in altering global gene expression through
the regulation of chromatin structure and its association with embryonic and adult stem cell
states21–24 as well as malignant tumours of diverse origins25–29. Hmga2 was derepressed
by Nkx2-1 knockdown in TnonMet cells and regions of KrasG12D/+;p53Δ/Δ tumours that
lacked Nkx2-1 expression were almost universally Hmga2pos (Fig. 4a–c). Importantly,
Nkx2-1neg areas of known metastatic primary tumours and metastases were also Hmga2pos
(Supplementary Fig. 9 and data not shown). Additionally, Hmga2 was downregulated in
TMet cells after expression of Nkx2-1 cDNA and in TnonMet-shNkx2-1 cells after
reexpression of Nkx2-1* (data not shown).
Although Hmga2 can be regulated by the Let7 family of miRNAs21,25,30, Let7 levels,
Lin28 expression, and Let7 activity were equivalent in TnonMet, TMet, and Met cell lines and
were unaltered in TnonMet-shNkx2-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 10 and data not shown).
Hmga2 promoter activity was derepressed in TnonMet-shNkx2-1 cells and repressed in TMetNkx2-1 cells, indicating that expression of Hmga2 in lung adenocarcinoma cells is regulated
at least in part through differential promoter activity (Supplementary Fig. 10).

We hypothesized that lung adenocarcinomas progress from an Nkx2-1posHmga-2neg to an
Nkx2-1negHmga-2pos state. However, metastatic and non-metastatic tumours could be
fundamentally distinct at the time of initiation. Hmga2 is highly expressed in embryonic
lung but not in any normal adult lung cells, and early after initiation, KrasG12D/+;p53Δ/Δ
tumours were uniformly Nkx2-1posHmga-2neg (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 11).
KrasG12D/+;p53-proficient tumours, which maintain their differentiated phenotype and never
metastasize even late after tumour initiation5, were almost universally Nkx2-1posHmga-2neg
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Poorly differentiated areas of KrasG12D/+;p53Δ/Δ tumours with
reduced Nkx2-1 expression were never found as in situ lesions and were almost always
associated with lower grade Nkx2-1-expressing areas (Supplementary Fig. 6). Finally, we

induced KrasG12D/+;p53Δ/Δ tumours with a pool of lentiviral vectors that contain nucleotide
barcodes. Amplification and sequencing of the lentivirus-encoded barcodes from adjacent
low-grade Nkx2-1posHmga2neg and high-grade Nkx2-1negHmga2pos areas showed that these
areas were clonally related (Supplemental Fig. 12). While alternate mechanisms leading to
the generation of clonally-related but phenotypically-distinct tumour cell populations are
possible, including the expansion of rare Nkx2-1neg cells that pre-exist within the tumour,
we believe that our data strongly suggest that lung adenocarcinomas undergo a transition
from an Nkx2-1posHmga-2neg state to a more aggressive Nkx2-1negHmga-2pos state. Our
data additionally indicate that an Nkx2-1-dependent gene expression program is a key
regulator of this transition.

We next analyzed the expression of NKX2-1 and HMGA2 in human adenocarcinoma.
Although the expression patterns were diverse, two important conclusions could be made.
First, tumours of NKX2-1posHMGA2neg and NKX2-1negHMGA2pos phenotypes exist
within the spectrum of human lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 10).
Second, there was a trend towards well-differentiated tumours being NKX2-1pos/
HMGA2neg whereas moderately and poorly differentiated tumours were more often
represented by other combinations of these proteins. Most notably, the moderately and
poorly differentiated groups contained NKX2-1neg/HMGA-2pos tumours (Fig. 4e). These
results underscore the diversity within this single human tumour type and suggest that our
genetically defined model likely represents, at the molecular level, a subset of these
tumours.

Author Manuscript

Next we knocked-down Hmga2 in TnonMet-shNkx2-1 cells and found that their metastasis
seeding potential was greatly reduced after transplantation (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig.
13). Additionally, Hmga2 knockdown in a metastasis-derived cell line reduced its
anchorage-independent growth and tumour seeding ability after transplantation (Fig 4g–h
and Supplementary Fig. 13). A future challenge will be to understand the molecular
mechanism by which Hmga2 controls lung adenocarcinoma metastatic potential. The
expansion of Nkx2-1negHmga-2pos regions within primary lung tumours suggests the
acquisition of phenotypes that are advantageous to the primary tumours and also increase the
probability of metastatic spread.

Author Manuscript

That NKX2-1 can have both oncogenic and tumour suppressive functions in lung cancer
presumably illustrating context-dependent functions within individual tumours of the same
type. Lung adenocarcinomas may differ in their cell of origin, mutation spectrum, or gene
expression leading to distinct requirements for continued NKX2-1 expression and different
capacity to tolerate or benefit from NKX2-1 downregulation. Our studies uncovered the
molecular and cellular basis for the association of NKX2-1 expression with good patient
outcome17,18 and HMGA2 expression with poor patient outcome26,27. Our results
emphasize the power of genetically-engineered mouse models of advanced disease, used in
conjunction with human studies, to elucidate mechanisms that control cancer progression
and metastatic spread. Through this approach we identified one molecular mechanism by
which a highly prevalent tumour type can progresses to its malignant state.

Methods Summary
Mice, tumour initiation, and derivation of cell lines
KrasLSL-G12D, p53flox, p53LSL-R270H, and p53LSL-R172H mice have been described3,5,19.
Tumours were initiated by intratracheal infection of mice with a lentiviral vector expressing
Cre-recombinase10. The MIT Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all
animal studies and procedures. Cell lines were created by enzymatic and mechanical
dissociation of individual lung tumours and metastases harvested from mice 8-14 months
after tumour initiation.
LM-PCR, Southern blotting, and gene expression analysis

Author Manuscript

LM-PCR was performed with forward primers specific for the lentiviral LTR. Southern
blotting used a Cre probe and standard methods. RNA was extracted using Trizol, analyzed
for RNA integrity, and prepared with Affymetrix GeneChip® WT Sense Target Labelling
and Control Reagents kits, followed by hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip® Mouse
Exon 1.0 ST Arrays.
Protein and RNA analysis
Western blotting used standard methods and antibodies to Nkx2-1 (Epitomics, Inc), Hmga2
(BioCheck, Inc), and Hsp90 (BD Transduction Laboratories) as a loading control.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 4μm sections
using the ABC Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories) with antibodies described above.
Sections were developed with DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Gene expression and knockdown

Author Manuscript

Nkx2-1 was stably knocked-down with a pLKO-based lentiviral vector (OpenBiosystems/
TRC). MSCV-Puro retroviral vectors were used for stable expression of Nkx2-1 and
Nkx2-1* (created with 4 silent mutations using QuikChange® Lightning Site-Directed
Mutagenesis (Stratagene). Hmga2 was stably knocked-down with an MSCV-Hygro
retroviral vector.
Transplantation experiments
For intravenous transplantation 105 cells resuspended in 200μl PBS were injected into the
lateral tail vein. For intrasplenic transplantation 105 cells resuspended in 50μl PBS were
injected. In all graphs each circle represents an individual mouse and the bar represents the
mean. Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t-test.

a, Nkx2-1 knockdown derepresses Hmga2 in TnonMet cell lines. b, Hmga2 and Nkx2-1 are
reciprocally expressed in KrasG12D/+;p53Δ/Δ murine lung adenocarcinomas. Scale bar =
50μm. Inlaid images show cellular features and protein localization. c, Hmga2 and Nkx2-1
expression in advanced KrasG12D/+;p53Δ/Δ murine lung adenocarcinomas. Fisher’s exact
test, p-value < 10−11. d, Early KrasG12D/+;p53Δ/Δ tumours are Nkx2-1posHmga2neg. e,
NKX2-1 and HMGA2 expression in human lung adenocarcinomas. Large numbers are
percentages. Small numbers are absolute numbers. f, Hmga2 knockdown reduces the
tumourigenic potential of TnonMet-shNkx2-1 cells after intravenous transplantation. Control
samples include the parental TnonMet-shNkx2-1 cells (grey circle) and cells infected by a
control retrovirus (black circles). p < 0.003. g, shHmga2 reduces anchorage-independent
growth of a metastasis-derived cell line (Met). Representative images and colony number
(mean +/− SD of quadruplicate wells, p < 0.0001). h, shHmga2 reduces the tumour-seeding
potential of a Met cell line after intravenous transplantation. p <0.0001.
