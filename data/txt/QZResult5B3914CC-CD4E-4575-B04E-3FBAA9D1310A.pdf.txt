Chemoresistance

Abstract
Many epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)–promoting
transcription factors have been implicated in tumorigenesis and
metastasis as well as chemoresistance of cancer. However, the
underlying mechanisms mediating these processes are unclear.
Here, we report that Foxq1, a forkhead box-containing transcription factor and EMT-inducing gene, promotes stemness traits and
chemoresistance in mammary epithelial cells. Using an expression proﬁling assay, we identiﬁed Twist1, Zeb2, and PDGFRa and
b as Foxq1 downstream targets. We further show that PDGFRa
and b can be directly regulated by Foxq1 or indirectly regulated
through the Foxq1/Twist1 axis. Knockdown of both PDGFRa and

b results in more signiﬁcant effects on reversing Foxq1-promoted
oncogenesis in vitro and in vivo than knockdown of either PDGFRa
or b alone. In addition, PDGFRb is a more potent mediator of
Foxq1-promoted stemness traits than PDGFRa. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition or gene silencing of PDGFRs sensitizes mammary epithelial cells to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and
in vivo. These ﬁndings collectively implicate PDGFRs as critical
mediators of breast cancer oncogenesis and chemoresistance
driven by Foxq1, with potential implications for developing novel
therapeutic combinations to treat breast cancer. Cancer Res; 75(3);

Introduction

remains undetermined whether there is a common mechanistic
element linking these processes.
Recently, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been
recognized as a mechanism for breast cancer cells to acquire
metastatic properties (2, 4–8). Many transcription factors including Snail (9, 10), Twist1 (11), Foxc2 (12), Zeb1, and Zeb2 (13, 14)
are capable of triggering EMT, promoting tumorigenesis and
metastasis, and enhancing chemoresistance. However, how these
transcription factors interact remains elusive, as do the crucial
mediators of these EMT-promoting genes. Discovering these
mediators could provide insight into the mechanisms of cancer
recurrence, metastasis, and chemoresistance, and eventually facilitate the development of a targeted cancer therapy.
Foxq1, a human Forkhead-Box gene family member (15–17),
has been shown to repress smooth muscle–speciﬁc genes (18) and
is involved in hair follicle development (19, 20). Foxq1 is overexpressed in different cancer types (21–23) and known to be
induced by TGFb signaling (24, 25). Consistent with these ﬁndings, our laboratory previously reported overexpression of Foxq1
in highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines and a direct correlation
between Foxq1 expression and poor outcomes in patients with
breast cancer. More importantly, we have also shown that ectopic
expression of Foxq1 triggers EMT and contributes to breast cancer
metastasis (26), a ﬁnding that was conﬁrmed in two follow-up
reports (25, 27). In our current study, we demonstrate that Foxq1
contributes to stemness traits and chemoresistance in mammary
epithelial cells and that these functions are dependent on the
Foxq1/Twist1/PDGFRs transcriptional axis. Using a loss-of-function assay and pharmacologic inhibition, we show that targeting
PDGFRs is potentially an effective therapeutic approach to reverse
oncogenesis, stemness traits, and chemoresistance driven by
Foxq1 in breast cancer.

Cancer recurrence, metastasis, and chemoresistance correlate
with each other and contribute greatly to the mortality of patients
with breast cancer (1–3). For example, metastatic breast tumors
tend to be more chemoresistant than primary tumors, as demonstrated by the marked decrease in the chemotherapeutic
response rate in the metastatic breast cancer setting versus the
neoadjuvant setting (1). In addition, chemoresistant tumors are
prone to metastasize and respond poorly to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This often correlates with earlier metastatic recurrence
and shorter disease-free and overall survival (1). However, it

PDGFRs Mediate Foxq1-Promoted Chemoresistance

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
HMLE cells (human mammary epithelial cells immortalized
with SV40 large T antigen and catalytic subunit of telomerase) and
HMLER cells (HMLE cells transfected with activated Ras gene)
were maintained in the culture as previously described (28).
Mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 was cultured in high-glucose
DMEM and supplemented by 10% FBS, NEAA, and antibiotics
(100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin). NMuMG
cells were cultured with DMEM medium with 4.5 g/L glucose,
10 mg/mL insulin and 10% FBS. All cell lines were authenticated
upon receipt by comparing them to the original morphologic and
growth characteristics.
Generation of gene overexpressing and knockdown stable cells
Full-length plasmids for Foxq1, Twist1, Zeb2, and Snail1 were
purchased from Open Biosystems. These genes were then subcloned into a pENTR vector and recombinated into the pLenti-6/
V5-DEST Vector. The lentiviruses for the full-length genes were
generated using the pLentivirus-expression system (Invitrogen).
The generated virus was used to infect targeted model cells.
Stable cells were generated after being selected with blasticidin
(10 mg/mL, Invivogen; refs. 29, 30).
A set of ﬁve shRNA clones for PDGFRa and b were purchased
from Open Biosystems. The shRNA sequences for targeting
PDGFRa, b and Foxq1 genes were shown in Supplementary
Table S1. The lentiviruses for the shRNAs of PDGFRs were generated using the Trans-Lentiviral packaging system (Open Biosystems) for shRNA expression. The generated virus was used to
infect targeted model cells. Stable cells were generated after being
selected with puromycin (2.5 mg/mL, Invivogen).
Microarray analysis and RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from cells of interest using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and puriﬁed using an RNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA (25 ng) was labeled with
dye and applied to the microarray. Changes in gene expression
were analyzed using a Sentrix human Ref-8 Expression BeadChip
(Illumina, 8 array "stripes"). Data was normalized using the
"average" method that simply adjusts the intensities of the two
populations of gene expression values such that the means of the
populations become equal. Fold enrichment values were used to
obtain the list of candidate genes with greater than two-fold
change. RT-PCR based on RNA from three independent cell
cultures was performed as previously described (31) to validate
the microarray result. Primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S2.
Cell proliferation, Transwell migration assay, Boyden chamber
invasion assay, and clonogenic assay
Detailed methods of these assays are given in the Supplementary Materials and Methods section.
Mammosphere formation assay
A mammosphere formation assay was performed as previously
described with the following modiﬁcations (32). Brieﬂy, ten
thousand cells were plated on a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate
(Corning Inc.) and were grown in serum-free mammary epithelial
growth medium (MEBM Basal Medium, Lonza) supplemented
with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF, 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone,

www.aacrjournals.org

5 mg/mL insulin, and 5 mg/mL b-mercaptoethanol. One milliliter
of medium was added every other day for 7 to 12 days. Images of
mammospheres were recorded and the number of mammospheres was manually counted. Experiments were performed in
triplicate and repeated two times.
Tumor xenograft studies
All mouse experiments were carried out in accordance with
approved protocols from the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Wayne State University (Detroit, MI). We performed tumor xenograft studies using either BALB/c or NCR
nu/nu female mice from NIH to study the effect of Foxq1 in
chemoresistance, tumorigenesis and PDGFR's effect in mediating
Foxq10 s function in chemoresistance. The detailed methods are
described in the Supplementary Material and Methods.
Statistical analysis
The quantitative results were analyzed using a two-sample t test
or one-way ANOVA. If the normality assumption did not
hold, these parametric tests were replaced by nonparametric tests
Wilcoxon or Kruskal–Wallis tests, respectively. The dose-response
curves for doxorubicin or paclitaxel within each cell line type were
analyzed using multiple linear regression with interactions and a
dummy variable to denote the conditions of imatinib. For analysis of synergism, a 2 by 2 factorial experiment design was used. A
two-way ANOVA model with two main factors imatinib and
doxorubicin at day 70, or paclitaxel at day 24, and their interaction
term was used. A statistically signiﬁcant synergistic effect was
observed if the interaction term was signiﬁcant and if its effect
was in the same direction.

Results
Foxq1 induces stemness traits and chemoresistance in
mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells
To determine whether Foxq1 induces stemness traits in mammary epithelial cells, we generated HMLE stable cell model
ectopically expressing the Foxq1 gene, in parallel with three
known EMT promoting genes Snail, Twist1, and Zeb2 to serve as
positive controls (28, 32). As anticipated, the resulting cells
(HMLE/Foxq1, HMLE/Twist1, HMLE/Zeb2, and HMLE/Snail)
acquired mesenchymal appearances and showed deregulation of
epithelial and mesenchymal markers (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and S1B). Using ﬂow cytometry, we analyzed cells for CD44 and
CD24 expression, two cell-surface markers whose expression in
the CD44high/CD24low conﬁguration are associated with both
human breast cancer stem cells (CSC) and normal mammary
epithelial stem cells (33, 34). More than 90% of the mesenchymal-like cells generated by Foxq1 overexpression acquired the
CD44high/CD24low expression pattern, compared with less than
1% of cells expressing control LacZ vector (Fig. 1A). This same cell
pattern shift was also observed for the Snail, Twist1, and Zeb2
overexpressed cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C). We then measured
the cells' ability to form mammospheres to conﬁrm acquired
stemness. All HMLE cells with these transcription factors formed
8- to 10-fold more mammospheres compared with HMLE cells
infected with the corresponding control vector (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E).
We next investigated the effect of Foxq1 expression on
chemoresistance. Using an MTT and clonogenic assay, we
observed signiﬁcantly more surviving HMLE/Foxq1 cells

compared with control HMLE/LacZ cells when treated with two
conventional chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicin (MTT IC50
values: 137.4 vs. 36.78 nmol/L for Foxq1 and LacZ, respectively) and paclitaxel (MTT IC50 values: 3.62 vs. 0.61 nmol/L for
Foxq1 and LacZ, respectively; Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Fig. S2A). Moreover, we found that 4T1/sh3 cells, a stable cell
line with marked Foxq1 inhibition (4T1/Foxq1-shRNA3;
ref. 26), displayed a signiﬁcant decrease in mammosphere
formation capability (Supplementary Fig. S2B). This line also
showed lower tumor initiation capability than nontargeted
control cells (4T1/NT) in an in vivo cell dilution assay (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Consistent with this, 4T1/Sh3 cells, when
compared with 4T1/NT cells, were considerably more sensitive
to doxorubicin (IC50: 24.05 vs. 62.58 nmol/L, respectively) and
paclitaxel (IC50: 36.30 vs. 96.04 nmol/L, respectively; Fig. 1D).
To evaluate chemoresistance in vivo, we injected the 4T1/sh3
and 4T1/NT cells into BALB/c mice. Both cell types grew at
similar rates without drug treatment in vivo. However, with
paclitaxel treatment, tumor growth was signiﬁcantly inhibited
by day 16 in the mice bearing 4T1/sh3 tumors compared with
the 4T1/NT tumors (Fig. 1E). Immunohistochemical analysis of
various apoptotic markers demonstrate that knockdown of
Foxq1 facilitates apoptosis induced by paclitaxel treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2D). Together, these results are consistent
with previous reports that Foxq1 expression is antiapoptotic in
colorectal cancer cell lines (23), suggesting that Foxq1 expression contributes to the stemness traits of mammary epithelial
cells and promotes chemoresistance of breast cancer cells.
The transcriptional axis between Foxq1, Twist1, and PDGFRs
and their clinical correlation
To gain more insight into the mechanism of Foxq1, we performed expression proﬁling to identify downstream targets of
Foxq1. A total of 293 genes (99 upregulated genes and 194

586 Cancer Res; 75(3) February 1, 2015

downregulated genes) were signiﬁcantly deregulated (3-fold
cut-off level) in HMLE/Foxq1 cells compared with HMLE/LacZ
control cells. A detailed analysis of these genes reveals they are
involved in different cellular biologic functions including cell-tocell adhesion, cell motility, EMT, and drug resistance (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Table S3).
Among the downstream targets that are upregulated by Foxq1,
PDGFRa and b are two well-known receptors involved in cancer
progression (Fig. 2B; refs. 35–38). We therefore explored whether
Foxq1 could directly regulate PDGFRa and b promoters. Transcription factor (TF)-binding prediction assays using rVista, CONTRA v2, and the EpiTect ChIP tool revealed seven potential Foxq1
binding sites within the 25-kb PDGFRa promoter region and nine
potential Foxq1-binding sites within the 25-kb PDGFRb promoter region (Fig. 2C). By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)PCR assay, we demonstrated signiﬁcant enrichment of DNA for
the ﬁrst Foxq1-binding site (F-Pa1) in the PDGFRa promoter
region and the sixth binding site (F-Pb6) in the PDGFRb promoter region, respectively (Fig. 2D). These data were further conﬁrmed by a luciferase assay, where mutations in the core sequence
of each of these two binding sites abolished the activation of
these two promoters by Foxq1 (Fig. 2E). These results suggest
that Foxq1 directly regulates expression of PDGFRa and b.
In parallel, Twist1 and Zeb2 genes were also identiﬁed as
downstream targets of Foxq1 (Fig. 2A and B), suggesting their
role as potential mediating transcription factors for Foxq1. We
further identiﬁed three potential Foxq1-binding sites in the Twist1
promoter region and two Foxq1-binding sites in the Zeb2 promoter (Fig. 3A). For the Twist1 promoter, a ChIP-qPCR assay
demonstrated enrichment of DNA in the ﬁrst binding site (F-T1)
close to the transcription start site (Fig. 3B). For the Zeb2 promoter, ChIP-qPCR data also showed that the ﬁrst binding site
(F-Z1) was signiﬁcantly enriched in the precipitated protein–DNA
complex (Fig. 3B). The results of ChIP-qPCR were further

(Supplementary Fig. S3C). For the PDGFRa gene, ChIP-qPCR

observed in the ﬁrst binding site (T-Pb1) (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). These results were further validated by luciferase assays
(Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F). Although six Zeb2-binding
sites were predicted to exist in the PDGFRb promoter region, none
of these sites showed signiﬁcant Zeb2 enrichment by ChIP-PCR
(Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D). Taken together, these data
strongly suggest an upstream role for Foxq1 on Twist1 and Zeb2
genes, and that Foxq1 controls PDGFRa and b expression through
both direct and indirect mechanisms.
We next analyzed the expression correlation of these genes in
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The expression of
Foxq1 and Twist1 are closely correlated with PDGFRa and b
(Supplementary Fig. S4A) in the level 3 gene expression (RNAseV2) dataset for breast cancer. More importantly, the correlation
of Foxq1, Twist1, and PDGFRs signiﬁcantly correlated with a poor
prognosis (Supplementary Fig. S4B). A similar correlation was
also observed in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and
several different cancer types (Supplementary Fig. S4C and data
not shown). This discovery substantiates the clinical importance
of the transcriptional cascade of Foxq1/Twist1/PDGFRs in cancer
progression.
Knockdown of PDGFRs blocks Foxq1-promoted oncogenesis in
vitro and in vivo
To investigate the role of PDGFRa and b in Foxq1-induced
oncogenic properties, we knocked down PDGFRa and b separately, in HMLE/Foxq1 cells using shRNA technique (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Silencing of either PDGFRa or PDGFRb
signiﬁcantly inhibited cell proliferation (data not shown), cell
migration, and invasion (Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D) when

588 Cancer Res; 75(3) February 1, 2015

compared with nontarget control counterparts, suggesting that
both PDGFRa and b contribute to Foxq1-induced cell proliferation and motility.
To explore potential synergistic effects of PDGFRa and b, we
generated a new construct expressing two shRNAs with signiﬁcant
inhibitory effects on both PDGFRa and b. This construct, when
packaged into a lentivirus and infected in HMLE/Foxq1 and
HMLER/Foxq1 (HMLE with activated Ras gene and Foxq1) cells,
produced signiﬁcant inhibition of both PDGFRa and b, which is
similar to what was observed for each of the individual shRNAs
(Fig. 4A). The basal expression of PDGFRs in HMLE/Foxq1 and
HMLER/Foxq1 are comparable (data not shown). As expected,
knockdown of both PDGFRa and b displayed greater inhibitory
effects on cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion, when
compared with knockdown of either PDGFRa or b alone (Fig. 4B
and C)
To examine the effects of PDGFRa and b on Foxq1-induced
tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo, HMLER/Foxq1 cells
expressing nontarget control (NT), a, b, or both a and b
PDGFR-silencing shRNA were injected into the fat pads of NCR
nu/nu mice. In the absence of PDGFRa and b, we observed a
signiﬁcant decrease in tumor burdens compared with NTexpressing HMLER/Foxq1 cells, with the double knockdown
of a and b showing the greatest effect (Fig. 4D). Moreover,
HMLER/Foxq1 cells with a NT control showed an average of
16.3 metastatic loci in the lung section. In contrast, cells with
either PDGFRa, PGGFRb, or both PDGFRa and b silencing,
showed an average of 7.8, 7, and 3 metastatic loci in the lung
section, respectively, as evidenced by positive staining with
anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 4E).

The effects PDGFRa and b on Foxq1-promoted stemness traits
Next, we assessed the effects of PDGFRa and b on Foxq1induced stemness in HMLE cells. We found that knockdown of
both PDGFRs, or PDGFRb alone, resulted in an approximate
25% decrease of CD44high/CD24low cells compared with the
nontarget vector control, while knockdown of PDGFRa produced a much smaller effect (<5%; Fig. 5A and Supplementary
Fig. S5E). Consistent with these results, knockdown of both
PDGFRa and b, or PDGFRb alone, but not PDGFRa alone,
signiﬁcantly inhibited Foxq1-induced mammosphere formation (Fig. 5B and C and Supplementary Fig. S5F and S5G),
suggesting a possible difference of PDGFRb and PDGFRa in
stemness characteristics. This result requires further validation
of an in vivo cell dilution assay. Interestingly, knockdown of

PDGFRa or b, alone or together, could not reverse Foxq1induced EMT at the molecular or morphologic level (Fig. 5D
and Supplementary Fig. S5H), suggesting Foxq1-induced EMT
does not totally depend on PDGFRs.
To explore the clinical implications of the aforementioned
discoveries, we investigated the therapeutic effect of the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor imatinib, which targets PDGFRs, c-ABL, and Kit
(39–41), on Foxq1-driven properties. We found that, in contrast to
PDGFRs, there was no signiﬁcant difference in c-ABL and Kit
expression between HMLE/Foxq1 and HMLE/LacZ cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Similarly, the phosphorylation level of PDGFRs,
but not ABL and Kit, was markedly higher in HMLE/Foxq1 compared with HMLE/LacZ cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Furthermore, imatinib treatment led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the

phosphorylation of PDGFRa and b (Supplementary Fig. S6C),
suggesting that PDGFRs are major targets for imatinib in HMLE/
Foxq1 cells. We further showed that cell proliferation of HMLE/
Foxq1 cells was signiﬁcantly inhibited with a high-dose imatinib
treatment after day 2 (Fig. 6A), whereas cell migration and invasion
were markedly inhibited within one day even with low-dose
imatinib treatment (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the CD44high/CD24low
cell population and mammosphere formation in HMLE/Foxq1
cells were signiﬁcantly decreased. There is a positive correlation
between imatinib concentration and the magnitude of these effects
(Fig. 6C and 6D and Supplementary Fig. S6D). Similar to PDGFR
knockdown, imatinib treatment was unable to reverse EMT at
morphologic or molecular levels (Supplementary Fig. S6E and

S6F). Similar results were achieved when we investigated the effects
of imatinib treatment on 4T1 cells, which are known to express
high level of Foxq1 (data not shown; ref. 26).

We next examined the effects of PDGFR on Foxq1-driven
chemoresistance. Similar to the effects on stemness traits,
knockdown of PDGFRb showed more signiﬁcant effects than
PDGFRa on sensitizing Foxq1-overexpressing cells to both
doxorubicin and paclitaxel, with double knockdown of
PDGFRa and b showing the most potent effect (Supplementary

PDGFRs Mediate Foxq1-Promoted Chemoresistance

Fig. S7A and S7B). In addition, low or intermediate doses of
imatinib generated minimal effects on cell proliferation, but
signiﬁcantly sensitized Foxq1-overexpressing cells, including
4T1, HMLER/Foxq1, and HMLE/Foxq1 cells, to doxorubicin
and paclitaxel. This is demonstrated by the statistically significant differences in the percentage of surviving cells in all cell
models with and without imatinib treatment (Fig. 7A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S7C). As expected, imatinib treatment had
no signiﬁcant effect on sensitizing NMuMG, a cell with low
levels of PDGFRs, to either doxorubicin or paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S7D).
We then implanted HMLER/Foxq1 cells into the fat pads of
NCR nu/nu mice and examined the effects of imatinib, alone or
together with doxorubicin, on tumor growth. In the presence of
imatinib, doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth by 80%, but
neither treatment alone inhibited xenograft growth signiﬁcantly.
Thus, a synergistic effect was observed for treatment with imatinib
and doxorubicin in vivo (P < 0.001; Fig. 7C). Consistent with these
results, treatment of 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice with imatinib and paclitaxel also generated signiﬁcant synergistic effects on
tumor growth in 24 days (P < 0.001; Fig. 7D). Furthermore,
combinational treatment produced marked tumor apoptosis
compared with single drug treatment as shown using immunohistochemistry against apoptotic markers (Supplementary Fig.
S8A and S8B). Overall, these results suggest that mammary cancer
cells can become sensitized to various chemotherapeutic agents
by targeting PDGFRs.

Discussion
In our current study, we have demonstrated that Foxq1, a
downstream target of TGFb, triggers EMT and induces stemness
traits and chemoresistance in mammary epithelial cells. This
function is at least partially due to the transcriptional regulation
of Foxq1 on PDGFRs directly or indirectly (Supplementary Fig.
S8C). Knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of PDGFR results
in not only reversion of stemness traits, but also increased sensitivity of cells to chemotherapeutic agents. This discovery suggests an important signaling transition between TGFb and PDGF,
which is mediated by a novel transcriptional axis, as a major
underlying mechanism for the acquisition of stemness traits and
chemoresistant phenotype in mammary epithelial cells and breast
cancer cells.
Several published articles suggest a role of PDGF/PDGFR
signaling in various developmental processes and cellular functions, including EMT. For example, autocrine PDGF/PDGFR
signaling contributes to maintenance of EMT, possibly through
activation of STAT1 and other distinct pathways (42). Inhibition of PDGFR signaling interfered with EMT and caused
apoptosis in murine and human mammary carcinoma cell
lines. In addition, targeting PDGFRs, either by overexpression
of a dominant-negative PDGFR or application of various drugs,
can interfere with tumor growth and metastasis in mice and
human patients (37, 43, 44). To our surprise, we demonstrated
that genetic manipulation or pharmacologic inhibition of
PDGFRs could reverse Foxq1-promoted oncogenesis and chemoresistance, but could not reverse Foxq1-triggered EMT at
either the cellular or molecular level, suggesting that, under
certain conditions, oncogenic properties of cancer cells are not
necessarily bound to EMT status. This serendipitous ﬁnding is
in contrast to the currently popular notion that EMT is a

www.aacrjournals.org

prerequisite for acquiring oncogenic properties during cancer
progression, because most EMT promoting genes also promote
stemness, oncogenesis, and chemoresistance. However, the
results of our study provide intriguing evidence of the disassociation of EMT and oncogenic characteristics in cancer cells,
suggesting a more complicated regulatory mechanism in EMT
and cancer progression.
We show for the ﬁrst time that PDGFRa and b have similar
functions in oncogenic properties, but have different functions in
stemness traits induced by Foxq1 in mammary epithelial cells and
breast cancer cells. This result resembles a discovery 30 years ago
indicating that PDGFRa and b demonstrate functional speciﬁcity
during embryogenesis (45, 46). In line with these observations, a
recent study showed that PDGFRa, but not PDGFRb, plays a
critical role in invadopodia formation (47). In another study,
PDGFRb, but not PDGFRa, informs intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma (36). Taken together, these
studies highlight the convergent and divergent functions of
PDGFRa and b in cancer development. The underlying mechanism could be distinct ligand afﬁnities and signiﬁcant low structure homology in the kinase insert and carboxy-terminal region of
these two isoforms, which lead to different downstream signaling
activation (48).
More importantly, anti–PDGFR-based approaches sometimes result in a mixed clinical response, suggesting the importance of identifying speciﬁc patient subgroups (36, 49). The
results of our current study demonstrate that PDGFRs are not
only important for the oncogenic properties of cancer cells, but
also critical for chemoresistance in human breast cancers overexpressing EMT-promoting genes like Foxq1. These ﬁndings
provide a rational basis for targeting PDGFRs in conjunction
with chemotherapeutic agents for suppressing tumor growth,
blocking metastasis or enhancing the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutic treatments. It is worth to mention that the high doses of
imatinib used in our study may not be appropriate for direct
transition to the clinic. More speciﬁc and less toxic PDGFR
inhibitors are needed in this scenario and could be a future
direction of our study. In summary, the innovative drug combination we identiﬁed provides proof of principle for a novel
combinational therapy for patients with breast cancer with
aberrant expression of EMT promoting genes such as Foxq1
and Twist1.
