Abstract
Various CD7-targeting immunotoxins have been tested for its potential in treating
CD7+ malignant patients but none of those immunotoxins was approved clinically
because of lacking enough efficacy and safety. Here we successfully constructed
the monovalent and bivalent CD7 nanobody-based immunotoxins PG001 and PG002,
both conjugated with a truncated derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin A respectively.
The prokaryotic system expressed immunotoxins not only maintained their binding
specificity for CD7-positive cells with a Kd of 16.74 nM and 3.6 nM for PG001 and PG002
respectively, but also efficiently promoted antigen-restricted apoptosis of the CD7positive leukemia cell lines Jurkat and CEM, and primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with an in vitro cytotoxic
activity (EC50) in the range of 23-30 pM for PG002. In NOD/SCID mice transplanted
with CEM cells, PG001 and PG002 prevented engraftment of the cells and markedly
prolonged mouse survival. Owing to the efficient antigen-restricted anti-leukemic
activity of PG002, this CD7 nanobody-based immunotoxin exhibited a superior antiCD7 positive malignancies activity than previously reported immunotoxins, and may
represent a promising therapeutic strategy in treating CD7-positive leukemia and
lymphoma, which still remain a significant clinical challenge.

INTRODUCTION

to chemotherapeutic agents [1]. Recently, ATL treatment
efforts, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation and molecularly targeted therapies [2, 3],
have improved overall survival durations. Furthermore,
treatment with the monoclonal anti-CCR4 antibody
mogamulizumab produced marked cytotoxic effects on
ATL cells, especially leukemic ATL cells [4].

T-cell lymphomas and leukemias are heterogeneous
hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, conventional
therapeutic strategies for aggressive adult T-cell leukemialymphoma (ATL) are not associated with satisfactory
outcomes, mainly because ATL cells are often resistant

However, more than half of ATL patients still
have relapses and die with progressive disease [5, 6].
Once a patient experiences chemoresistance or a relapse,
treatment options are limited, and the survival duration
is short. Thus, effective novel therapies with distinctive
mechanisms that can avoid multi-drug resistance and have
favorable specificity and toxicity profiles are needed to
treat human T-cell malignancies. Immunotoxins consisting
of peptide toxins fused with tumor cell-selective antibody
fragments or ligands are believed to be effective against
and remain sensitive to chemoresistant T-cell disorders [7].
Recent findings indicated that immunotoxins have highly
and specifically cytotoxic effects on tumor cells in vitro
and in vivo, which may represent an important method of
cancer therapy [7, 8].
One of the key points in using immunotoxins
is to choose appropriate receptors in tumor cells.
CD7 is a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily [9] that is expressed on
most thymocytes, peripheral blood T cells, and natural
killer cells [10– 12]. Many studies indicated that CD7
is expressed mainly on T-cell lymphoma and leukemia
cell [13–15] but absent from at least a small portion
of normal T lymphocytes [16]. Another key property
of CD7 for therapeutic applications in cancer cases is
its rapid internalization after binding to an antibody or
antibody derivative [17], which makes it well suited
for drug delivery. Accordingly, various immunotoxins
specific for CD7 have been generated and tested for
their anti-leukemic effects. Most studies focused
on plant-derived toxins such as ricin, saporin and
derivatives [18– 22], in while one anti-CD7 monoclonal
antibody-ricin A chain immunotoxin entered in clinical
trial, resulting in two partial responses and one
minimal response in eleven patients with reproducibly
induced occurrence of dose-limiting vascular leak
syndrome(VLS) [21]. Unfortunately, none of those
immunotoxins was approved clinically because of
lacking enough efficacy and safety. For examples,
studies show that dgA, a ricin derived toxin, is cytotoxic
to endothelial cells, which become leaky even before
cytotoxicity can be measured [23]. Another toxin, a
truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA’
or PE38), fused to a CD7 scFv fragment caused only
approximately 20% cell death of primary leukemiaderived cells, and without further examination in in vivo
model, implying that T-lineage leukemia cells may not
be sensitive to ETA’, or further improvement for the
reported CD7 scFv is needed [24]. Indeed, anti-CD22
variable domain formed immunotoxin with ETA’ showed
impressive 46% complete remission without obvious
dose-limited toxicity (DLT) in the clinical trial for hairy
cell leukemia patients, suggesting ETA’ is a potent toxin
for at least some lymphocytes [25]. Therefore, novel
anti-CD7 variable fragments may provide us a new
option to improve the immunotoxin efficacy on T-cell
lymphomas and leukemias.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To develop novel anti-CD7 antibody, nanobody is
selected as our development strategy for those reasons:
nanobody is an antibody fragment consisting of a single
monomeric variable antibody domain derived from
camelidae heavy-chain antibodies that was discovered
by Hamers-Casterman et al. [26]. The outstanding
biochemical and physical properties of nanobodies make
them exceptional candidates for targeted delivery of
biologically active drugs [27]. Investigators have shown
that nanobodies can be coupled with toxins and other
functional molecules, and then used to deliver conjugates
to cancer cells for the treatment of cancer and other
diseases [28–31].
In the present study, we have chosen to design
nanobody-PE38 immunotoxin for two reasons: 1)
nanobody should have reduced immunogenicity, because
most human-anti-mouse antibody responses (HAMA)
are directed against the Fc-portion of whole antibodies
[32] and nanobodies are weakly immunogenic in humans
[33]; 2) it has been reported that ETA-based toxins have
approximately 1000-fold lower affinity for endothelial
than ricin-derived toxins [34] and should therefore cause
far fewer vulvar lichen sclerosus symptoms [35].
Here, we characterized two CD7 nanobody-based
immunotoxins effects on T-ALL cell lines and patientderived primary T-ALL and AML cells in vitro, and
evaluated their anti-leukemic potential in vivo.

RESULTS
Screening and characterization of anti-CD7
nanobodies
To obtain nanobodies against CD7, we screened
a phage nanobody library constructed using the
immunoglobulin repertoire of peripheral blood
lymphocytes obtained from llamas immunized with
CD7-positive Jurkat cells. We panned the phage display
library with intact cells as described previously [36, 37]
using parental 293T and stabilized CD7-expressed 293T
cells. After four rounds of screening, 30 clones were
characterized for their cell-binding ability using a wholecell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay approach
[36]. Finally, 12 CD7-positive clones were sequenced
(Supplementary Figure S1), and two clones (VHH6 and
VHH10) with different complementarity determining
region sequences were chosen for further analysis.
VHH6 and VHH10 were subcloned into pET28a vector
to induce soluble nanobody expression and purified
them (Supplementary Figure S2). The affinity of VHH6
and VHH10 on jurkat cells was determined with flow
cytometry as described previously [38]. Interestingly,
both exhibited strong binding ability with Jurkat cells,
for which VHH6 had superior affinity (15.37 nM versus
29.63 nM for VHH10) (Figure 1A). We further examined
the specificity of VHH6 for CD7 using flow cytometric
and immunofluorescence assays. As shown in Figure 1B
34071

Oncotarget

and 1C, VHH6 exhibited marked binding to the CD7positive T-cell lines Jurkat and CEM, but failed to bind the
RPMI8226 and H460 cells (Figure 1D and 1E). We also
incubated VHH6 with CD7 stabled line 293T cells (293TCD7) and 293T cells. Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B
showed that VHH6 specifically bound to 293T-CD7 cells
but not parental 293T cells. The VHH6 also did not bind
to CD7 negative cell line Ramos (Supplementary Figure
S3C). Immunofluorescence experiments also indicated that
VHH6 bound to Jurkat cells but not to RPMI8226 cells
(Figure 1F and 1G). We also tested the specificity of VHH6
for H460 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1CD7. VHH6 strongly bound to pcDNA3.1-CD7 transfected
H460 cells, but not to pcDNA3.1-transfected control
cells (Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B). Importantly,
immunofluorescence results from H460 cells were highly
similar to flow cytometry results for H460 cells using
commercially available antibody (Supplementary Figure
S4C and S4D).We used the VHH6 and commercially
available antibody to test the CD7 expression in transfected
H460 cells by flow cytometry. The result indicated that
the VHH6 and commercially available antibody showed
similar binding ability (Supplementary Figure S4E). Thus,
the above data suggests that VHH6 is a high-affinity, highly
specific nanobody.

we examined cells by annexin V and 7-AAD staining.
Annexin V-positive, 7-AAD-negative early apoptotic
cells were clearly detectable among Jurkat and CEM cells
treated with PG001 for 24, 48, and 72 hours at 150 ng/ mL
(Supplementary Figure S6). We also observed that PG001
induced cell-growth inhibition via apoptosis in a timedependent manner but did not suppress RPMI8226 cells
cell growth (Supplementary Figure S6). The cytotoxic
effect of PG001 was blocked by co-incubation of the cells
with a 100-fold molar excess of the parental nanobody,
but irrelevant nanobody failed to block the cytotoxicity
(Figure 3C and 3D). In addition, treatment of Jurkat and
CEM cells with PG001 for 24 hours induced cleavage
of PARP, a characteristic feature of apoptotic cells
(Figure 3E). Induction of apoptosis was also prevented
by the presence of the parental nanobody (Figure 3E).
However, treatment of the CD7-negative cell lines
RPMI8226 and H460 did not induce cleavage of PARP
(Supplementary Figure S7), demonstrating that PG001
induces apoptosis of CD7-positive leukemia-derived cell
lines in an antigen-specific manner and is effective at low
nanomolar concentrations.

Production and characterization of monovalent
nanobody-based immunotoxin PG001

Although PG001 shows potential in clinical
applications for leukemia therapy, due to its smaller
molecular weight, PG001 may have a shorter half-life than
scFv-based immunotoxins in vivo. To improve the cellbinding affinity and in vivo half-life of PG001, as well as
to potently induce leukemia cell apoptosis, construction
of a bivalent nanobody-based immunotoxin with a longer
half-life and greater cell-binding affinity is necessary. As
shown in Figure 4A and 4B, the highly purified bivalent
nanobody immunotoxin PG002 was obtained. Importantly,
we are able to harvest about 5 mg of purified active PG002
from 1 L of a bacterial culture. We used the size exclusion
chromatography to test whether the immunotoxins of
PG001 and PG002 are the monomeric forms. As showed
in Supplementary Figure S8, the results demonstrate that
VHH6, PG001 and PG002 presented as monomers. In
addition, PG002 exhibited stronger binding ability than
PG001 did for CD7 positive Jurkat cells, while there was
no binding to CD7 negative H460 cells (Supplementary
Figure S9).This bivalent immunotoxin also maintained
specific binding feature to CD7-positive cells. The affinity
of PG001 and PG002 on Jurkat cells was determined by
flow cytometry as described above. The result shows that
the bivalent isoform PG002 (Kd = 3.61 nM, Figure 4C)
has the more binding affinity than the monovalent
immunotoxin PG001 (Kd = 16.74 nM, Figure 4C). Then
the cytotoxic activity of PG002 was measured by WST-8
assay. The results demonstrated that PG002 significantly
suppressed Jurkat and CEM cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner (EC50, 30 pM for Jurkat cells and 23 pM

Bivalent nanobody-based immunotoxin PG002
and its cytotoxicity on leukemic cells

A schematic of the monovalent immunotoxin PG001
is shown in Figure 2A. Purified PG001 exhibited greater
than 90% purity, with a yield of about 10 mg from 1L
of a bacterial culture. A single affinity purification cycle
resulted in a highly enriched protein reactive with an
antibody specific for the 6 × His tag (Figure 2B and 2C).
The recombinant immunotoxin retained specific binding to
CD7-positive Jurkat and CEM cells (Figure 2D and 2E),
but did not bind to CD7-negative RPMI8226 or H460
cells (Figure 2F and 2G), indicating that PG001 is a CD7specific nanobody-based immunotoxin.

Dose-dependent, antigen-specific induction of
apoptosis by PG001
PG001 cytotoxic activity was determined using
WST-8 assay. The results indicated that PG001 markedly
suppressed Jurkat and CEM cell growth in a dosedependent manner at low nanomolar concentrations
(EC50, 1.0 nM for Jurkat cells and 0.5 nM for CEM
cells) (Figure 3A and 3B). But the agent failed to inhibit
CD7 negative RPMI8226 and H460 cells proliferation
(Figure 3A and  3B). Meanwhile, the VHH6 nanobody,
PE38, and irrelevant monovalent immunotoxin has no
obvious toxicity on Jurkat and CEM cells, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S5). To determine whether
cellular growth inhibition is induced via apoptosis,

inhibit the proliferation of RPMI8226 cells. The bivalent
nanobody dVHH6 and immuntoxin dVHH22-PE38 did
not suppress Jurkat and CEM growth (Supplementary
Figure S10). The PG002 also markedly inhibited 293TCD7 cell growth but without obvious toxicity on 293T
cells (Supplementary Figure S11). Importantly, PG002

significantly induced CEM cell apoptosis at 50 ng/mL, and
its cytotoxic effect on CEM cells was completely blocked
by co-incubation of the cells with a 100-fold molar excess
of the parental antibody dVHH6, but not with irrelevant
bivalent nanobody (Figure 4E). Similar results were
observed using Jurkat cells (data not shown), suggesting
that PG002 is more effective than PG001 in vitro.

later, the mice received four intravenous injections of 5 μg
of PG001 and PG002 or a noncovalent nanobody mixed

that mice given the four injections of PG001 (P = 0.0133)

than did control mice on the same injection schedule of
a noncovalent nanobody mixed with PE38. Untreated
controls exhibited a similar effect on survival as that
in mice given the noncovalent nanobody mixed with
PE38, and we did not observe a statistically significant
difference between the noncovalent nanobody/PE38 and
untreated control groups. The median survival durations
were 29.5  days for PBS control group, 30.5 days for
noncovalent nanobody/ETA group, 38 days for the
PG001treated group, and 48 days for PG002 treated group.
Notably, both PG001 and PG002 induced slight weight
loss, which completely recovered after immunotoxin
administration (Figure 6B).

To evaluate the cytotoxic potential of PG001
and PG002 in patient-derived primary leukemia cells,
mononuclear cells obtained from five patients were
treated with 500 ng/mL PG001 and 100 ng/mL PG002
respectively, or in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess
of the parental nanobody dVHH6. The expression of
CD7 on AML (patients 1–4) and T-ALL (patient 5) cells
is shown in Figure 5A. PG001 and PG002 effectively
induced apoptosis of these primary leukemia cells
(Figure 5B, 5C and 5D). PG002 also induced cytotoxicity
in an antigen-dependent manner, as the apoptosis in the
tested samples with PG002 was blocked by the presence
of the parental nanobody.

after the generated immunotoxin eliminates all CD7positive cells. 2) CD7 is rapidly internalized after antibody
binding [17], which makes CD7 antibody a potential
targeted delivery approach for patients with T-cell diseases
[18–21, 24].
Traditional antibody-conjugates preparation (including
scFv) is expensive with poor stability. In contrast, nanobodies
are only one domain proteins, which enables them to
penetrate tissues, pass through barriers such as the bloodbrain barrier, and be efficiently expressed as soluble, nonaggregating recombinant proteins with high yields, and
weak immunogenicity [39]. Therefore, fusion of toxins to
nanobodies is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer [29].
Additionally, the truncated PE38 of PE was therapeutically
effective in patients with relapsed, chemotherapy-refractory
leukemia or other hematological malignancies [35, 40, 41].
The nanobody-based immunotoxins PG001 and
PG002 lack Fc fragments, resulting in reduced bindings
with Fc-receptors on non-leukemia cells, similar to singlechain variable fragments immunotoxins [24, 42, 43].
When leukemia cells treated with immunotoxins were
stained by annexin V and 7-AAD, and measured cleavage

DISCUSSION
We identified a nanobody against CD7, VHH6,
with high affinity and specificity, and then constructed
the monovalent and bivalent VHH6-based immunotoxins
PG001 and PG002 respectively. These two immunotoxins
induced efficient antigen-specific apoptosis of T-ALL
cell lines at nanomolar (PG001) and picomolar (PG002)
concentrations, and effectively eliminated patient-derived
primary T-ALL and AML cells via apoptosis. PG001,
markedly inhibited engraftment of CEM cells in a NOD/
SCID mouse model. Moreover, PG002 was much more
effective than PG001 (P = 0.0008).
CD7 is an ideal therapeutic target for two reasons: 1)
there is a subset of CD7-negative peripheral normal T cells
existed [16], which may maintain immune functions
required for the prevention of opportunistic infections

leukemia cells and there was no in vivo examination tested
[24]. Thus, our current results have inspired us to initiate
clinical trials, especially for PG002 in the near future.
We have noticed that some research teams
constructed the scFvCD7:sTRAIL [47] and scFvCD7:sFasL
[48] humanized immunotoxins, which effectively
suppressed proliferation of CD7 positive cell lines
and patient-derived CD7 positive cells. Since these
immunotoxins were developed from endogenous protein
of human origin, they may have less immunogenicity or
nonspecific toxicity leading to vascular leak syndrome.
Although these immunotoxins were not examined in vivo
yet, we are still triggered to develop CD7 nanobody based
immunotoxins with sTRAIL and sFasL in the future.
Other research groups demonstrated that bispecific
single-chain immunotoxins were more effective than
monospecific or bivalent immunotoxins in vitro and
in vivo [49, 50]. Nanobodies can be easily formatted to
construct bispecific immunotoxins to bind two different
epitopes or antigens on cancer cells. Also, bispecific
immunotoxins generated with nanobodies may have a
nice property that is easily expressed in a prokaryotic
expression system like our bivalent immunotoxin PG002.
Thus, our research results laid a reasonable foundation for
the further construction of bispecific immunotoxins.
In summary, we constructed monovalent (PG001)
and bivalent (PG002) CD7 nanobody-based immunotoxins
which can effectively eliminate CD7-positive T-ALL
and fresh patient-derived T-ALL and AML cells with
antigen-specificity at low concentrations. Based on the
observations that PG001 and PG002 effectively and
selectively killed human leukemia cells and significantly

of PARP, the results indicated that cellular growth was
inhibited via apoptosis similar as previous studies [24, 42].
The present study offered several new findings. 1)
PG001 and PG002 were efficiently expressed as soluble
recombinant proteins with high purity and yields from
a prokaryotic expression system. The output of purified
protein was about 10 mg for PG001 and 5 mg for PG002
from 1L of bacterial culture, more than 50 times greater
than the output of CD7 scFv-PE38 and CD33 scFv-PE38
immunotoxins constructed by others [24, 44]. Since the
cost of PG001 and PG002 production was greatly reduced
by using prokaryotic expression system, make them
promising in clinical applications. 2) The EC50 of PG002
was at the picomolar level on Jurkat and CEM cell lines,
and the killing effect of PG002 was further enhanced
about 30 times greater than that of PG001, similar to
other immunotoxins applied in the clinic [35, 45]. The
greater killing effect of PG002 in vitro was correlated to
enhanced affinity of this immunotoxins [46]. Furthermore,
PG002 increased apoptosis of freshly collected patientderived T-ALL and AML cells in vitro at a single dose as
low as 100 ng/mL. In contrast, previously reported CD7
scFv- PE38 immunotoxin has limited killing effect on
T-ALL sample at 100 ng/ml even working for 96 hours
[24]. 3) We examined the anti-leukemic potential of PG001
and PG002 in NOD/SCID mice xenotransplanted with
CEM cells. The results indicated that both immunotoxins
prevented engraftment of the cells and markedly prolonged
survival of the treated mice. Notably, this is the first report

and CD7-expressed 293T cell lines. After four rounds of
screening, 30 clones were selected to characterize their cell
binding using a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay as described previously [36], in which CD7-negative
and -positive 293T cells were used as controls. All CD7positive and some CD7-negative nanobody clones were
selected for sequencing.

prolonged the survival of treated mice, PG001 and PG002
may deserve further evaluation of their potential for antileukemia in preclinical and clinical studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and plasmids
Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used
for plasmids transformation and screening of nanobody
libraries. E. coli BL21 (DE3; Novagen,) was used for
nanobodies and immunotoxins expression. Nanobody
libraries were generated using the phagemid vector
pComb3XSS (Biovector NTCC), and the vector pET28a
(Novagen) was used for inducible expression of soluble
nanobodies and immunotoxins. The vector pcDNA3.1/
myc-His B (Life Technologies) was used for construction
of the plasmid pcDNA3.1-CD7, which was transfected
into H460 human lung cells with lipofectamine 2000
(Life Technologies). The lentiviral vector pCDH-CMVMCS-EF1-copGFP (System Biosciences) was used for
construction of stable 293T-CD7 cell lines.

Production and purification of CD7-specific
nanobodies
To induce soluble expression of nanobody
fragments, two cDNAs coding for CD7-specific
nanobodies were subcloned into the expression vector
pET28a containing 6×His and HA tags, which allowed for
purification and characterization of the nanobodies. The
plasmids were propagated in E.coli BL21 (DE3). Induction
of expression and purification of the two CD7- specific
nanobodies was performed as follows. A E.coli BL21
(DE3)-transformed plasmid was cultured in 3 mL of LB
broth in the presence of 100 μg/mL kanamycin at 37°C
overnight. The culture was then diluted at 1:100 in fresh
LB medium containing 100 μg/mL kanamycin. At the
early log phase (opitical density at 600 nm = 0.6–0.8) of
bacterial growth, protein expression was induced at 22°C
by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG, Sangon Biotech) to the culture for 6–8 hours. The
nanobodies were then purified using Ni-NTA agarose (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Imidazole was removed using dialysis with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4°C. Protein
fractions and purity were analyzed via sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein
concentrations were determined using a BCA assay
(Beyotime). One CD7 negative nanobody was purified as
negative control.

Patient samples and cell lines
Heparinized peripheral blood and bone marrow
samples were obtained from AML and T-ALL patients
after they signed informed consent to participate in the
study and with the approval of the Ethics Committees of
Soochow University. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
were isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
(Thermo Scientific) containing 20% fetal bovine serum
(Biowest). The human T-ALL cell lines Jurkat and CEM,
human lung cell line H460 and human B cell line Ramos
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum. The human myeloma cell
line RPMI8226 were maintained in Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (Thermo Scientific) containing
10% fetal bovine serum and human embryonyc kidney
HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium(Thermo
Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell
lines were cultured in a medium with 100 U/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C in a
humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere.

Construction and expression of nanobody-based
immunotoxins
Sequence coding for the CD7-specific nanobody
(VHH6) and then truncated ETA were synthesized with an
N-terminal 6-His tag and a 20-amino-acid linker 4(G4S)
between the nanobody and truncated ETA. The C-terminal
REDLK retention motif against the KDEL motif was
substituted with the KDEL sequence. The sequence was then
ligated in the expression vector pET28a, which was then
named pET28a-VHH6-PE38-KDEL. To prepare a bivalent
nanobody-based immunotoxin, another VHH6 sequence
was inserted into pET28a-VHH6-PE38-KDEL, and the
resulting sequence was named pET28a-dVHH6-PE38KDEL. Expression of the nanobody-based immunotoxins
was induced at low temperatures as described above, and the
immunotoxins were named PG001 (monovalent nanobody
immunotoxin; VHH6-PE38) and PG002 (bivalent nanobody

Nanobody screening
Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood
lymphocytes obtained from Camelus dromedarius
immunized with CD7-positive Jurkat cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen), used as a template for cDNA
synthesis (Fermentas), and cloned into the phagemid vector
pComb3XSS. Propagation of VHH libraries and filamentous
phages was performed by following published procedure

immunotoxin; dVHH6-PE38). The immunotoxins were then
purified as described above. In addition, one CD7 negative
nanobody of VHH22 was prepared and constructed as
irrelevant immunotoxins in monovalent and bivalent forms.

Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 hour at room
temperature for each reaction. Cells were washed twice with
PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and the cells
fluorescence was measured using confocal fluorescence
microscopy. In addition, H460 cells were transfected with
the empty vector pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-CD7 using
lipofectamine 2000. The CD7 expression on transfected
H460 cells was then detected using a nanobody with
immunofluorescence as described above. At the same
time, the CD7 expression on transfected H460 cells was
assessed using a commercially available anti-human
CD7 IgG antibody labeled with phycoerythrin(PE) (BD
PharmingenTM) and nanobody VHH6 as described above.

Determination of the cell-binding ability and
affinity of nanobodies, PG001 and PG002
To evaluate the cell-binding ability of the nanobodies
and immunotoxins, nanobodies or immunotoxins at different
concentrations were incubated with Jurkat cells on ice.
After two washes with ice-cold PBS, a bound nanobody or
immunotoixn was detected with an Allophycocyanin(APC)labeled anti-HA tag antibody(Miltenyi Biotec) or an Alexa
Fluor 488-labeled anti-His tag antibody(Qiagen) in PBS
containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour on ice. Cells
were then washed twice with PBS, and their fluorescence
was measured using a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences).
Binding saturation curves, and Scatchard plots were
generated and nonlinear regression analysis was performed
using the Prism software program (Graph Pad Software).

Immunotoxins cytotoxicity assay
Survival of cells treated with immunotoxins was
measured using a WST-8 assay with a Cell Counting
Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Briefly,
1 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate were incubated
with immunotoxins at various concentrations (H460 and
293 T cells were seeded at 3 × 103/well) for 72 hours, after
which 10 μL of CCK-8 reagent was added to the wells.
The plate was incubated until the wells with a maximum
absorbance at 450 nm. To determine whether cell-growth
inhibition was attributable to apoptosis, cells were seeded
in 24-well plate at 2.5 ×  105/ mL and treated with the
immunotoxins. Whole cells were stained with fluorescein
isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD;BD PharmingenTM) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. For experiments with primary
samples obtained from patients, cells were seeded in
24- well plates at 4 × 105/ mL and treated with 500 ng/mL
PG001 and 100 ng/mL PG002. For blocking experiments,
cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105/mL(cell line) or 4 × 105/ mL
(primary cells) in 24-well plates, and a 100-fold molar
excess of the parental nanobody or irrelevant nanobody was
added to the culture 1 hour before adding the immunotoxin.

Flow cytometric analysis
The binding of nanobodies to cells (jurkat, CEM,
RPMI8226, H460, 293T and Ramos cells) was analyzed
using a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). Cells were
stained with nanobodies as described previously [37]. Ten
thousand events were collected for each cell sample, and
analyses of whole cells were performed using appropriate
scatter gates to exclude cellular debris and aggregates.
To monitor binding of nanobodies and immunotoxins,
cancer cells were incubated with immunotoxins at a
concentration of 5 μg/mL, after two washes and then
add an Allophycocyanin(APC)-labeled anti-HA tag
antibody(Miltenyi Biotec) or an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled
anti-His tag antibody(Qiagen) for one hour. After a final
wash, the cells were analyzed using fluorescence-activated
cell sorting. The CD7 expression in patient derived
leukemia cells was used the commercially available antihuman CD7 IgG antibody labeled with phycoerythrin (PE)
(BD PharmingenTM) to test.

SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blot
analysis
Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue
R250 (Amresco). Also, Western blots with secondary
antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase were
performed. Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP
Substrate (Merck Millipore) was used for detection.
PG001 was detected using an anti-His tag rabbit antibody
(CST). Full-length poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
and its specific cleavage products were detected using a
mouse anti-human PARP antibody (Beyotime).

Cell immunofluorescence
To determine the specificity of the nanobodies, a
cell immunofluorescence assay was performed. Jurkat and
RPMI8226 cells were seeded in a six-well plate containing
coverslips treated with poly-L-lysine (Beyotime), and
incubated at 37°C overnight. The cells were washed with
ice-cold PBS three times and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
the fixative was subsequently quenched with 100 mM
glycine in PBS for 15 minutes. Nanobodies were added
to fixative at 5 μg/mL for 45 minutes. Bound nanobodies
were detected using a rabbit-anti-HA tag (1:1000) in PBS
containing 2% bovine serum albumin followed by Alexa
