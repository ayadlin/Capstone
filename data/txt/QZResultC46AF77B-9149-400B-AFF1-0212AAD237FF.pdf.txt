ABSTRACT
Deregulation of mTOR and IGF pathways is frequent in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), thus mTOR and IGF1R represent suitable therapeutic targets in HCC. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the effects of mTOR inhibitors (mTORi) and OSI-906,
blocker of IGF1R/IR, on HCC cell proliferation, viability, migration and invasion, and
alpha-fetoprotein (α-FP) secretion. In HepG2 and HuH-7 we evaluated, the expression
of mTOR and IGF pathway components; the effects of Sirolimus, Everolimus,
Temsirolimus and OSI-906 on cell proliferation; the effects of Sirolimus, OSI-906,
and their combination, on cell secretion, proliferation, viability, cell cycle, apoptosis,
invasion and migration. Moreover, intracellular mechanisms underlying these cell
functions were evaluated in both cell lines. Our results show that HepG2 and HuH7 present with the same mRNA expression profile with high levels of IGF2. OSI906 inhibited cell proliferation at high concentration, while mTORi suppressed cell
proliferation in a dose-time dependent manner in both cell lines. The co-treatment
showed an additive inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and viability. This effect was
not related to induction of apoptosis, but to G0/G1 phase block. Moreover, the cotreatment prevented the Sirolimus-induced AKT activation as escape mechanism. Both
agents demonstrated to be differently effective in inhibiting α-FP secretion. Sirolimus,
OSI-906, and their combination, blocked cell migration and invasion in HuH-7. These
findings indicate that, co-targeting of IGF1R/IR and mTOR pathways could be a novel
therapeutic approach in the management of HCC, in order to maximize antitumoral
effect and to prevent the early development of resistance mechanisms.

If diagnosed at early stage, HCC can be cured by surgical
tumor resection or liver transplantation [2]. However, only
10-20% of patients are candidates for curative surgery,
and approximately 80-90% of patients are not eligible for
surgery because of the extent of tumor, the tumor spread

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
common malignancy worldwide and the third most
frequent cause of global cancer-related mortality [1, 2].

and the level of underlying liver dysfunction [1–4].
HCC has been shown to be chemoresistant to the most
common chemotherapic compounds [2]. In this setting,
targeted therapies could represent a new therapeutic
option in HCC patients. In particular, sorafenib, a small
molecule multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been
demonstrated to improve survival, in terms of median
overall survival, in patients with advanced HCC [2, 5],
although approximately one-third of patients treated with
sorafenib experience disease progression [6]. Therefore,
novel treatment options are required in the management
of HCC.
Hepatocarcinogenesis has been suggested to be
a complex multistep process characterized by a broad
spectrum of molecular abnormalities [7]. The study of the
molecular mechanisms involved in HCC pathogenesis has
highlighted the existence of several signaling pathways,
which might be targetable with new therapies, representing
new potential treatments in patients with advanced HCC.
Particularly, an increased expression of insulin-like growth
factor (IGF) 2 and IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) [8–11] and a
deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways
[7, 12] have been reported in HCCs.
The IGF signaling pathway is a controlled
endocrine system that is physiologically involved in the
regulation of human development, energy balance, cell
growth and development and it is biologically active
in many neoplastic processes [11]. IGF1R is a tyrosine
kinase receptor sharing approximately 84% amino acid
homology with insulin receptor (IR). IGF1R, activated
by IGF1 and IGF2 derived from endocrine, autocrine
and paracrine sources, transduces signals to PI3K/AKT/
mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling pathways, via insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), mediating the regulation of cell growth, proliferation,
motility, invasion and metastasis, in a variety of human
malignancies [13]. Therefore, the IGF pathway is
considered a potential target for antineoplastic therapy in
several tumors, including HCC [13, 14].
mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that
controls cell growth in response to nutrients and growth
factors and it has been found to be frequently deregulated
in cancer. mTOR resides in two distinct complexes named
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2); both
complexes are activated by distinct upstream signals,
regulate different biological processes and have different
sensitivities to rapamycin, a macrolide ester produced by
Streptomyces hygroscopicus [15–17]. Activation of the
PI3K by growth factors results in the phosphorylation
of AKT which consequently elicits mTORC1 activation,
leading to the downstream phosphorylation of two
main effectors: eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E-binding protein 1 (4eBP1 (EIF4EBP1)) and ribosomal
protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K (RPS6KB1)). Both 4eBP1
and p70S6K are regulators of mRNA translation and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stimulate the synthesis of several proteins involved in
cell proliferation [18]. The use of rapamycin (Sirolimus)
and its analogues (mTOR inhibitors (mTORi)) in
preclinical and clinical investigations has revealed that
mTORC1 pathway is involved in a network of signaling
cross-talk and feedback mechanisms and that mTORC1
inhibition results in loss of negative feedback loop and
in the activation of AKT and MAPK pathway, reducing
the effectiveness of mTORi in cancer treatment [19–21].
Therefore, a potential concomitant suppression of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways, targeting IGF1R/IR
and mTOR, can be highly detrimental for tumor growth.
The aims of the current study were: 1) to
characterize the IGF and mTOR pathways, 2) to evaluate
the effect of IGF1R/IR blocking, using the dual inhibitor
OSI-906, and mTOR blocking, using several mTORi as
single agents and 3) to evaluate wheter the combination of
the two categories of compounds has an additive effect in
the regulation of cell secretion, proliferation, migration,
invasion and cell cycle in two HCC cell lines.

RESULTS
mTOR and IGF pathway components are
expressed in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues
In the attempt to define the role of mTOR and IGF
pathways in HCC, RT-qPCR was performed to quantify
the messenger expression level of mTOR, 4eBP1,
p70S6K, IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF2R and IR (isoforms
A and B), in THLE-2, HepG2 and HuH-7 cell lines, in
normal liver and in HCC and peritumoral tissues. Both
HCC cell lines presented the same messenger expression
profile as shown in (Figure 1A and 1B). All mTOR and
IGF pathway components were expressed in HCC tissues
(Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Figure S2)
and in THLE-2, HepG2 and HuH7 cells (Figure 1A and
1B) except IGF1 that was surprisingly not detectable in
both HCC cell lines. The messenger levels of mTOR and
IGF pathway components of cell lines were compared
to the normal hepatocytes (THLE-2) and are reported
in Supplementary Table S1 as mean±S.E.M. mTOR
components and activated forms of IGF1R and IR were
expressed at protein levels in HepG2 and HuH-7 cells as
shown in (Figure 1C, 1D, 1E and 1F). In both HCC cell
lines, mTOR was essentially located at perinuclear and
cytoplasmic level, whereas, p70S6K and 4eBP1 were sited
in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. In both HCC cell lines,
IR and IGF1R resulted to be activated in basal condition.

OSI-906 exerts a moderate antiproliferative
effect in HCC cell lines
In both HCC cell lines, the treatment with OSI906 at serial concentrations between 10−10 and 10−6M did
not induce a clear dose- and time-dependent inhibition

was reached only at the maximum dose (10−6M) after 9
days of treatment: (HepG2: 30% of inhibition, p<0.001;
IC50>100nM); HuH-7: 24% of inhibition, p<0.001;
IC50>100nM). Dose-time response curves for both
cell lines are shown in (Figure 2A and 2B). The IC50
and the inhibition of cell proliferation after 3, 6 and
9 days of treatment in both cell lines are summarized
in Supplementary Table S2. The value of inhibition is

Combining Sirolimus and OSI-906 induces
an additive inhibition of proliferation and cell
viability in HCC cell lines
In order to show an enhancement strengthening of
the antineoplastic effect of OSI-906 and SIR, cells were
treated with 10−10M SIR and 10−6M OSI-906, as single
agents and in combination (S+O). After 3, 6 and 9 days
of treatment, SIR and OSI-906 significantly suppressed
cell proliferation and the drug combination induced an
additive inhibition of cell proliferation in both cell lines
(Figure 3A and 3B). In HepG2, S+O induced a 94.43%
of inhibition after 9 days (p<0.001 vs control, p<0.001 vs
SIR and p<0.001 vs OSI-906) (Figure 3A) of treatment.In
HuH-7, S+O induced a 92.64% of inhibition after 9 days
(p<0.001 vs control, p<0.01 vs SIR and p<0.001 vs OSI906) (Figure 3B).
The combined treatment further inhibited HepG2
cell viability compared to single agents showing an
additive effect after 6 and 9 days of treatment (72.85% of
inhibition: p<0.001 vs control, p<0.05 vs SIR and p<0.05
vs OSI-906) (Figure 3C). The drug combination showed
additive inhibition of HuH-7 cell viability after 3 and 6,
with a maximum effect (70.29%) of inhibition after 9 days
(p<0.001 vs control and p<0.001 vs OSI-906) (Figure 3D)

mTORi induce dose-dependent and
time-dependent antiproliferative effect in
HCC cell lines
SIR, EVE and TEM significantly suppressed
cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Figures 2A and 2B). In HepG2 all the mTORi
significantly inhibited cell proliferation after 3, 6 and
9 days of treatment. In these cells, all the compounds
showed the maximum effect after 9 days of treatment at
the highest tested concentration (10−8M): the inhibitory
effects of SIR, EVE and TEM were 93.16% (p<0.001),
91.13% (p<0.001) and 91.28% (p<0.001), compared
to the control, respectively. In HuH-7 all the mTORi
were able to significantly inhibit cell proliferation
after 3, 6 and 9 days of treatment. The maximum effect
was reached after 9 days of treatment at the highest
tested concentration (10−8M): the inhibitory effects of
SIR, EVE and TEM were 95.9% (p<0.001), 83.32%
(p<0.001) and 95.83% (p<0.001), compared to the

in an increased rate of arrested cells in G0/G1 phase,
compared to each compound alone (OSI-906 vs control
p<0.05; S+O vs control p<0.01; S+O vs OSI-906 p<0.05;
S+O vs SIR p<0.01) and, accordingly, in a decreased
percentage of cells in the S phase (OSI-906 vs control
p<0.05; S+O vs control p<0.01). In HuH-7, 24hrs single
and combined treatment with SIR and OSI-906 did not
induce a significant increased rate of arrested cells in G0/
G1 phase compared to the control. No increased rate of
cells in subG1 phase was present in both cell lines treated
with SIR and OSI-906, alone or in combination, indicating

Sirolimus and OSI-906 regulate cell cycle profiles
in HCC cell lines
To determine the effects of OSI-906 and SIR on cell
cycle progression, HepG2 and HuH-7 cells were treated
with drugs alone and in combination and analyzed for cell
cycle phase. As shown in Figure 4A, in HepG2, 24hrs
of combined treatment with SIR and OSI-906 resulted

Sirolimus and OSI-906 suppress migration and
invasion in HuH-7 cell line

the absence of apoptotic cells, as confirmed by the lack
of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage
(Figure 4B).

At the experimental condition tested, the extent of
migration of untreated HepG2 cells was very low and
neither OSI-906 nor SIR further suppressed HepG2 cell
migration (Figure 6A). In HuH-7, SIR did not inhibit cell
migration (Figure 6B), while OSI-906 (p<0.001 vs control)
and drugs combination (p<0.001 vs control) significantly
decreased HuH-7 cells migration. Interestingly, in HuH7, the combined treatment showed an inhibition of 53%
compared to the control and an additive effect in driving
the inhibition of cell migration compared to single
agents (p<0.001 vs control, SIR and OSI-906). Matrigel
invasion assay was performed to investigate cell invasion
capability. At the experimental condition tested, HepG2
did not show invasion competence (Supplementary Figure
S3). In HuH-7, SIR and OSI-906 caused a remarkable
decrement of cell invasion, corresponding to 60% and
47%, respectively, (p<0.001 vs control for both drugs)
while the combined treatment did not show additive
inhibition compared to treatment with each compound as
a single agent (Figure 6C).

Sirolimus and OSI-906 induce a reduction of
α-FP secretion in HCC cell lines
To test the effect of both drugs on cell secretion, α-FP
secretion levels were measured in cell culture medium by
CLIA. SIR and OSI-906 induced a significant inhibition of
α-FP secretion, normalized to the amount of DNA in each
well, in HepG2 and HuH-7, suggesting a direct effect of
the two drugs on α-FP secretion. In HepG2, SIR 10−10M
and OSI-906 10−6M induced a significant inhibition of
α-FP secretion after 3, 6 and 9 days of treatment (Figure 5).
SIR caused the maximum effect after 9 days of treatment
(75%, p<0.001 vs control), while the maximum effect of
OSI-906 was reached after 6 days of treatment (42,4%,
p<0.001 vs control). The OSI-906 effect was partially lost
after 9 days of treatment. The co-treatment induced the
87% of inhibition (p<0.001) after 6 days and this effect
was still sustained after 9 days of treatment.
In HuH-7, SIR 10−10M induced the maximum inhibition
after 6 days of treatment (82%, p<0.001 vs control) and this
effect was maintained also after 9 days. OSI-906 10−6M
inhibited α-FP secretion only after 9 days with a maximum
inhibitory effect of 23% (p<0.001 vs control). The combined
treatment reached the maximum inhibitory effect after 9 days
(93%, p<0.001 vs control). Nevertheless, although this effect
was greater than that obtained with the single treatments,
it was not significantly different from the α-FP secretion
inhibition induced by the single treatment with SIR (Figure 5).

Combination of Sirolimus and OSI-906 regulates
AKT/mTOR/p70S6K and ERK pathways in
HCC cell lines
To investigate whether the cytostatic effects of OSI906 and SIR were correlated with changes in intracellular
components belonging to both mTOR and IGF pathways,
AKT/mTOR/p70S6K and ERK signaling have been

SIR and OSI-906, as single agents and in combination,
were analyzed by Western blot. In HepG2, SIR did not

induce a significant decrement of serum-induced p70S6K
phosphorylation (Ser389), nor changed ERK1/2 (p42/
p44) phosphorylation, but caused a significant induction

of AKT phosphorylation (Ser473) (p<0.01 vs control).
When used alone, OSI-906 did not caused any changes
in the p70S6K, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation
compared to control. When OSI-906 was combined
with SIR, serum-induced p70S6K phosphorylation was
markedly inhibited compared to control (p<0.05) and
further reduced compared to the effects of each drug used
alone. Moreover, the activation of AKT and ERK1/2 was
prevented by the combined treatment (Figure 7).
In HuH-7, SIR induced a significant decrement
of serum-induced p70S6K phosphorylation (Ser389)
(p<0.05) but no changes were observed in AKT and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The treatment with OSI-906
induced a significant inhibition of p70S6K and AKT
phosphorylation (p<0.01 vs control) but no change of
serum-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. After combined
treatment no additive effect on AKT and p70S6K
dephosphorylation was reported, but the combination of
both agents resulted in a stronger dephosphorylation of
ERK1/2 (p<0.05 vs control) (Figure 7).

[23–27]. Despite their outstanding preclinical antitumor
activity, mTORi, used as monotherapy in the management
of HCC, have not confirmed the anticipated efficacy [28,
29]. This is probably related to the activation of feedback
compensatory loops leading to tumor cell resistance
like the up-regulation of IRS-1 protein levels and the
induction of IRS-1 phosphorylation [19], the activation
of both Akt phosphorylation via mTORC2 [30–32] and
MAPK pathway via S6K/PI3K/Ras pathway [20]. These
mechanisms may counteract the anticancer efficacy and
may explain the variable response rates, demonstrated in
different tumor types, when treated with mTORi.
In this study, it has been hypothesized that the
combination of a dual blocker of IGF1R/IR, OSI-906, with
the mTORi SIR, would potentiate the antitumor effects of
SIR used as a single agent in HCC cells, because downregulating AKT and MAPK survival pathway upstream
with OSI-906, the resistance to mTORi, induced by
mechanisms of escape, can be overcome. Therefore, for
the first time, the effects of treatments with an mTORi
and OSI-906 in terms of cell proliferation, viability,
secretion, migration and invasion have been analyzed in
two of the most common used HCC cell lines. Firstly, the
expression of mTOR and IGF pathway components has
been investigated in two human HCC cell lines, in one
normal hepatocytes cell line, and confirmed in normal
liver tissue and in HCC tissues and related peritumoral
tissues. Both cell lines expressed comparable messenger
levels of mTOR components, with higher levels of
4eBP1and mTOR, compared to normal hepatocytes, and a
similar profile for IGF pathway components, with higher
IGF2 and IRB compared to normal hepatocytes. The
mTOR components and the activated forms of IGF1R and
IR expression have been also confirmed at protein levels in
the investigated HCC cell lines. According to the literature,
and confirmed by our study, HepG2 and HuH-7 do not
express IGF1, but they express IGF1R and high levels of
IGF2 [8]. This latter could lead to autocrine stimulation

DISCUSSION
HCC represents a chemoresistant aggressive type of
cancer with generally poor prognosis [2, 4, 22]. Sorafenib
is the only systemic therapy that has been demonstrated
to prolong median survival and the time to progression
in patients with advanced HCC [2, 5]. However, the
overall outcomes are far from being satisfactory, firstly
because of the genetic heterogeneity of HCC that can
cause primary resistance to sorafenib and secondly
because long-term exposure to sorafenib often results in
acquired resistance of tumor cells to drug with consequent
disease progression [6]. Therefore, new therapeutic
strategies for HCC are needed. More effective systemic
treatment options may include the combination of agents
with additive/synergistic activity against HCC. mTORi
have been used in the treatment of various solid tumors

of growth and motility through IGF1R and/or IR [33–35],
acting as an important driver for HCC cell growth. The
messenger and protein expression of IR has also been
investigated previously in these two cell lines [8, 36]. In
particular, IR protein expression has been investigated by
western blot and a qualitative evaluation of IR isoform
expression was conducted by RT-PCR analysis [8, 36].
Here the expression of both IR isoforms was investigated
by RT-qPCR and comparable messenger levels of IRA and
IRB were found in HepG2 and in HuH-7.
The in vitro antiproliferative and antisecretory
effects of the mTORi and of the dual IGF1R/IR blocker,
OSI-906, were evaluated. All used mTORi were been
tested for the first time for a long period (9 days). The
mTORi treatment induced a significant inhibition of
cell growth in vitro, in a dose-time dependent manner,
in both cell lines. Conversely, OSI-906, after both
short-term (3 days) and long-term (9 days) treatment,
was much less effective than mTORi in inhibiting cell
proliferation, demonstrating that blocking IGF1R and IR
is not a sufficient condition to reduce cell proliferation.
Nevertheless, in both cell lines, OSI-906 showed a
modest antiproliferative effect at high concentration.
These results are consistent with a previous published
study [8], whose results demonstrated that IR and IGF2
expression levels are positively correlated with sensitivity
to OSI-906. The decision to continue the experiments by
combining OSI-906 with SIR in particular, among all the
mTORi, was based on several observations. First of all,
SIR is the first mTOR allosteric inhibitor; EVE and TEM
are synthetic rapamycin analog compounds, also known
as “rapalogs”. Moreover, SIR and OSI-906 have shown
antitumor activity, as single agents, in preclinical studies
in HCC [8, 37–39]. Secondly, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and
MAPK pathways are critical for cell proliferation, survival
and resistance to apoptosis and both SIR and OSI-906
interact with these pathways [8, 31], which are known to
be deregulated in HCC. Therefore, we choose to combine
SIR with OSI-906 at concentrations of 10−10 M and 10−6M
respectively, taking into account that these concentrations
are lower than the maximum concentration achieved in
blood, in patients with solid tumors enrolled in Phase I/II
clinical trials [40, 41].
The combined treatment with SIR and OSI-906
showed an additive antiproliferative effect, in terms of
both proliferation and viability, compared to treatment
with both agents used alone. The analysis of the
mechanisms underlying these antiproliferative effects
revealed that in HepG2 the combined treatment with SIR
and OSI-906 did non induce a significant inhibition of
ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with the control, but
caused a significant block of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation
triggered by the single treatment with SIR and OSI906. Moreover, the co-treatment significantly blocked
the escape pathway mediated by AKT phosphorylation,
which follows the inhibition of mTORC1. The inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of p70S6K activation induced by the co-treatment with
SIR and OSI-906, was more pronounced than treatment
with single agents, but not significantly different. In HuH7, the co-treatment did not induce a stronger inhibition
of ERK1/2 and p70S6K phosphorylation, compared to
treatment with single agents. SIR was not able to block the
AKT phosphorylation. Nevertheless, OSI-906 abrogated
the escape pathway on AKT, induced by the treatment with
SIR. Although SIR has been previously reported to induce
cell apoptosis [42], G0/G1 phase arrest, and not apoptosis,
appeared the predominant mechanism responsible for the
observed antiproliferative effects of SIR and OSI-906 in
single and combined treatment. It could be speculated that
the arrest in G0/G1 phase, mediated by these drugs, is due
to the trigger of senescence [43] or autophagy [44].
The most widely used onco-glycoprotein marker
for detecting HCC is serum α-FP [45]. It has been
demonstrated that α-FP has pleiotropic effects, affecting
the processes of cell differentiation, cell proliferation
and tumorigenesis [46, 47]. The results of the current
study demonstrated that both drugs induced a significant
reduction of α-FP secretion after 3, 6 and 9 days of
treatment in HepG2, while SIR has a pivotal role in
inhibiting α-FP secretion compared with OSI-906 in HuH7, independently from the effect on cell proliferation. The
mechanisms responsible for this effect still need to be
clarified.
Cell migration and invasion are implicated in the
pathophysiology of many diseases, including cancer
[48]. Prior to and during metastatization, tumor cells
undergo several morphological changes and acquire an
increased motility potential. Cell migration and invasion
are critical parameters in the formation of metastasis [48].
The inhibition of these two key-processes can block the
metastatic process, based on neoplastic cells invasion into
the surrounding tissue and intravasation into blood or
lymphatic vessels [48]. In this study it was demonstrated
for the first time that SIR and OSI-906 can arrest migration
and invasion of HuH-7, and, furthermore, the combination
of the two agents showed an additive inhibition of cell
migration. HuH-7 is a selected HCC cell line with more
mesenchymal characteristics compared to HepG2 cell
line; indeed, it has been previously showed that HuH-7
cells express mesenchymal markers (Vimentin and Zeb1)
contrarily to HepG2 cells, which mainly express epithelial
markers (E-cadherin and ErbB3) [8]. The epithelial pattern
of expression showed by HepG2 could suggest that these
cells behave more like epithelial than mesenchymal cells,
thus providing an explanation for the lacking invasion
capability of this cell line.
In conclusion, although the use of mTORi and OSI906 failed to provide beneficial clinical effects in HCC
and other solid tumors when used as single agents, this
in vitro study produces the evidences of a significant
antitumor effect of the combined treatment with SIR and
OSI-906 in human HCC cell lines. These results represent

(European Collection of Cell Cultures) and Health Science
Research Resources Bank (HSRRB), respectively. HepG2
cells, whose doubling time is around 48h, were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% of FBS, 1 × 105 U/L
penicillin and 2mmol/L L-glutamine, whereas HuH7, whose doubling time is around 31h, were cultured in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) GlutaMax
medium with 10% of FBS and 1 × 105U/L penicillin and
streptomycin. Cell lines were grown in a humidified
condition in 5% CO2 at 37°C. HCC cell lines identity
was confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling (LGC
Standards Cell Line Authentication service).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
In this study, two HCC cell lines (HepG2 and HuH7), one normal hepatocyte cell line (THLE-2) and seven
HCC and peritumoral tissues were characterized for the
mRNA expression of the most important components
of the IGF and mTOR pathways. Moreover, in HCC
cell lines, protein expression of mTOR components
and p-IGF1R and p-IR has been detected as well. The
effects of mTORi (Sirolimus (SIR), Everolimus (EVE),
Temsirolimus (TEM)) and the dual inhibitor of IGF1R
and IR, OSI-906, as single agents, were tested in doseand time (3, 6 and 9 days)-dependent manner on cell
proliferation. The serial doses used for these experiments
ranged between 10−14 and 10−8M and between 10−10 and
10−6M for the mTORi and OSI-906, respectively. In order
to explore the effects of mTORi in combination with OSI906 in both human HCC cell lines, selected doses of SIR
(10−10M) and OSI-906 (10−6M) were tested as single agents
and in combination (S+O) at different incubation times
according with the different experimental procedures,
in particular after 3, 6 and 9 days of treatment on cell
proliferation, viability and secretion, and after 24 hours
of treatment on migration, invasion and cell cycle. In the
experiments using the combination of two drugs, SIR was
chosen among the different mTORi since it is considered
the reference mTORi compound, and the selected doses
used for the combined treatment were chosen as doses
lower than blood maximal concentration (Cmax) reached
in the target population of the pharmacokinetic studies
reporting the therapeutic response of these agents [49, 50].
The times used for the different experiments were selected
based on the appropriate times for each experimental
methodology. In order to analyze the signalling mechanism
underling the investigated processes, in both cell lines
the effect of SIR plus OSI-906 on mTOR and MAPK
components (AKT, ERK1/2, p70S6K phosphorilation) and
on Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage were
evaluated.

HCC human tissues
Seven frozen tissues and their peritumoral
biospecimens have been supplied by Biobank of Istituto
Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori “Fondazione
Giovanni Pascale” (IRCCS) of Naples. For the use of the
clinical materials for research purposes, the Institutional
Research Ethics Committee approved the study, and prior
patient consent was obtained.

Drugs and reagents
The mTORi, SIR, EVE and TEM, and the IGF1R/IR
inhibitor, OSI-906, were purchased from LC Laboratories
(Inc. Woburn, MA, USA). All compounds were dissolved
in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 100%, as recommended by
the manufacturer, as stock solutions concentrated 10−3M
and stored at −20°C. For each experiment, serial dilutions
in DMSO 40% were freshly made prior to use.

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR
RT-qPCR was performed to quantify the messenger
expression level of the most important mTOR pathway
components (mTOR, 4eBP1 and p70S6K) and of IGF
pathway components (IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF2R, and
IR (isoforms A and B)) in THLE-2, HepG2, HuH-7 cell
lines and in HCC and peritumoral tissues. The cells and
the tissues were lysed on ice in a lysis binding buffer
containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM LiCl,
10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% LiDS, 5 mM DTT, and 5
U/100 μl ribonuclease inhibitor (HT Biotechnology
Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The mRNA was isolated from
total RNA with the use of prewashed Dynabeads Oligo
(dT)25 (Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) for 10′ on ice. The
beads were collected with a magnet and washed three
times with 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 M LiCl, 1
mM EDTA, 0.1% LiDS, and once with a similar buffer
from which LiDS was omitted. The poly (A+) mRNA
was eluted twice, for 2′ each time, in H2O (65°C) and
20 μl were used for cDNA synthesis in a Tris buffer (50
mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 100 mM KCl, 4 mM DTT and
10 mM MgCl2) with 10 units RNase inhibitor, 2 units
avian myeloblastosis virus Super Reverse Transcriptase,

Cell lines
THLE-2 cell line, derived from primary normal
liver cells , was purchased from ATCC (American Type
Culture Collection) and cultured in Williams E without
fenol red with 10% FBS, 1 × 105 U/L penicillin and
streptomycin, cell maintenance cocktail B (Gibco) and
10mM Dexamethasone (Gibco). Two human HCC cell
lines, HepG2 and HuH-7, were purchased from ECACC

oligo dT (5 ng/μl) and 1 mM of each dNTPs in a final
volume of 40 μl. This mix was incubated for 1 h at 42°C
and the resulting cDNA was diluted fivefold in 160 μl
sterile H2O. The cDNA was used for quantification of
mRNA levels of all investigated genes. The total reaction
volume (12.5 μl) consisted of 5 μl of cDNA and 7 μl of
TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems,
Branchburg, NJ, USA) with primers-probes. Primers
and probes sequences and concentrations are shown in
Supplementary Table S3. All primers and probes were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. RT-qPCR was performed
in 96-well optical plates with the TaqMan Gold nuclease
assay (Perkin Elmer Corporation, Foster City, CA, USA)
and the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System
(Perkin Elmer, Groningen, The Netherlands), using the
standard protocol. Briefly: after two initial heating steps
at 50°C (2′) and 95°C (10′), samples were subjected to 40
cycles of denaturation at 95°C (15”) and annealing at 60°C
(60”). All samples were assayed in duplicate. Values were
normalized against the expression of the housekeeping
gene phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Results are
expressed as mean of three different experiments. Dilution
curves were constructed to calculate PCR efficiencies (E)
for every primer–probe set [51]. Primer’s efficiencies have
been reported in Supplementary Table S3. The relative
expression of target genes was calculated using the
comparative threshold method, 2−ΔCt [52] with efficiency
correction of target and reference gene transcripts, as
described previously [53]. To exclude genomic DNA
contamination in RNA extracts, cDNA reactions were also
performed without reverse transcriptase and amplified with
each primer pair. To exclude contamination of the PCR
mixtures, reactions were also performed in the absence of
cDNA template, in parallel with cDNA samples.

(DAPI) (Lonza Group Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) staining,
diluted in PBS 1X 1:40000, was used to visualize the
nuclei. Negative controls were performed, in which
cells were incubated with secondary antibody with the
omission of the primary antibody. Staining was visualized
on an inverted microscope Olympus IX51 equipped for
fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy (Olympus,
Milan, Italy) and the images were captured at 40X
magnification and acquired with Olimpus Digital Camera
F-View II (Olympus, Milan, Italy).

Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array
Phospho-IGF1R and phosphor-IR were measured
with Human Phospho-RTK Array Kit (#ARY001B) from
R&D. HepG2 and HuH-7 cells were lysed and assays were
carried out according to manufacturer’s protocols.

Cell proliferation assay
After trypsinization, HepG2 and HuH-7 cells were
plated in 1 ml of complete culture medium in 24-well
plates at different density, based on growth curves at 3,
6 and 9 days. For HepG2, 3.5 × 104, 2.0 × 104 and 5 ×
103 cells were plated for 3, 6 and 9 days, respectively.
For HuH-7-1, 3.0 × 104, 1.5 × 104 and 5 × 103 cells were
plated for 3, 6 and 9 days, respectively. The plates were
then placed in incubator in 5% CO2 at 37°C. After 24hrs,
the test compounds were added to each well at different
concentrations: SIR and TEM in a concentration range
between 10−13 and 10−8M, EVE, that has been shown to
be more effective than other mTORi in both cell lines,
in a concentration range between 10−14 and 10−8M and
OSI-906 in a concentration range between 10−10 and
10−6M. Controls were vehicle-treated. Plates were further
incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. In experiments with 6 and
9 days of treatment, medium was changed and compounds
were fresly added every 3 days. After 3, 6 and 9 days of
treatment, cells were harvested for DNA measurement.
Also the combined effect of SIR (10−10M) and OSI-906
(10−6M) was evaluated after 3, 6 and 9 days of treatment.
Measurement of total DNA content, representative for the
number of cells, was performed using the bisbenzimide
fluorescent dye (Hoechst 33258) (Boehring Diagnostics,
La Jolla, CA), as previously described [54].

Immunofluorescence staining
The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/1X
PBS for 30 min at 4°C into culture-slides. Slides
were washed thrice in 1X PBS for 5 min and placed in
permeabilization buffer (Triton 0.25%/1X PBS) for 10
min. After subsequent thrice washing in 1X PBS for
5 min, slides were placed in blocking buffer (5% goat
serum/Triton 0.1%/1X PBS) for 1h at RT. The cells were
incubated with primary antibodies against mTOR (rabbit
monoclonal Ab, clone 7C10, #2983 Cell Signalling,
diluted 1:200), p70S6K (mouse monoclonal Ab, clone
H-9, sc-8418 Santa Cruz, diluted 1:50), 4eBP1(rabbit
monoclonal Ab, #9644 clone 53H11, Cell Signalling,
diluted 1:200) in blocking buffer for 1h at RT. Slides
were washed thrice in 0.1% Triton/PBS for 5 min and
incubated 1h with rhodamine-conjugated secondary
antibodies (ImmunoReagents, Inc., Raleigh, NC) diluted
1:1000 in blocking buffer for mTOR and 4eBP1 and with
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Millipore, Temecula, California) diluited
1:1000 for p70S6K. A 4.6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole

Cell viability assay
After trypsinization, HepG2 and HuH7 cells were
seeded in 96-well plates. Cells were plated in 100μL of
culture medium at different density selected on the bases
of previously performed growth curves at 3, 6 and 9 days.
Particularly, 3 × 103, 2 × 103 and 1 × 103 HepG2cells were
plated for 3, 6 and 9 days, respectively. 2.5 × 103, 1.5 ×
103 and 1 × 103 HuH-7cells were plated for 3, 6 and 9 days
respectively. Cells were exposed to a single and combined
treatment with SIR (10−10M) and OSI-906 (10−6M). 10μl of
9727

Oncotarget

MTT solution, concentrated 5 mg/ml in PBS, was added
to 90 μl of medium in each well. The cells were then
cultured for a further 1h. MTT was removed and 100 μL/
well of solvent (isopropyl alcohol, 10% HCl) were added
to the cells in constant stir for 15′ at room temperature.
Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a plate reader
(Victor X4, Perkin Elmer, Italy). Vehicle-treated cells were
used as control.

different time points: 0, 2hrs, 4hrs, 6hrs, 8hrs, and 24hrs.
The areas of the scratch-wounds were analysed by Image
J software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The rate of scratch
closure was calculated by subtracting the remaining width
of the scratch lines from the width of the baseline scratch
(control) at consecutive time points. Each experiment was
repeated at least three times. Four readings were made for
each sample at each time point.

Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle

Transwell invasion assay

HepG2 and HuH-7 were plated at density of 1,5 ×
105 in 6-well plates in full medium. Cells were allowed
to fully adhere for 24hrs, then, SIR (10−10M) and OSI906 (10−6M) were added alone and/or in combination.
Since both drugs were diluted in DMSO, a double amount
of DMSO was added to the control wells and the cells
treated with the single agents were supplemented with an
extra amount of DMSO. After 24hrs of treatment, cells
were harvested by trypsinization, washed with cold PBS,
resuspended in PBS + EDTA, fixed in 96% ethanol and
stored at -20°C overnight until the flow-cytometric assay
was performed. Fixed cells were rinsed twice with PBS
lacking calcium and magnesium and stained with 50μg/
mL of propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma Aldrich) in the
presence of Rnase A (10μg/mL) at room temperature in the
dark for 1h. DNA content was determined by FACSCanto
II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), with
a 488nm Coherent laser. The channel FL2 was used to
analyse 20,000 events. Data were acquired by FACSDiva
software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and analysis
was performed by using Modfit version 2.0 software.

Cell invasion was assessed using BioCoat Matrigel
Invasion Chambers (BD) [56]. Matrigel Invasion
Chambers were hydrated in the tissue culture incubator
for 2hrs, by placing serum free medium on the bottom of
the well and in the top of the chamber. After hydration
of the Matrigel, the medium in the bottom of the well
was replaced with 800 μl of medium containing 10%
FBS. 5 × 104 HepG2 and HuH-7 cells were plated in 200
μl of serum free medium in the top of the chamber and
were exposed to 10−10M of SIR, 10−6M of OSI-906, and
a combination of them. The invasion assay was carried
out for 24hrs in the tissue culture incubator. Cells were
fixed by replacing the culture medium on the bottom and
top of the chamber with 3,7% formaldehyde dissolved
in PBS for 15′ at room temperature and with methanol
for 2′. After fixing the cells, the chambers were rinsed in
PBS and stained with Giemsa for 10′. After washing the
chambers several times by dipping the chambers in a large
beaker filled with PBS, the cells (now blue in color) on
top of the Matrigel membrane were removed with several
Q-tips. All the cells that remained in the chamber were
the ones that invaded the membrane, passed throughout
the membrane, and ultimately reached the bottom side of
the membrane. Invasiveness was determined by counting
cells in five microscopic fields per well, using an inverted
microscope equipped with 10X objective. The rate of
inhibition (%) was calculated using the following formula:
(1 – number of invading cells of the treatment group/
number of invading cells of control group) × 100.

Alpha-fetoprotein (α-FP) secretion
HepG2 and HuH-7 cells were cultured in 24well plates and treated for 3, 6 and 9 days as previously
described for cell proliferation. The amount of α-FP in
the cell culture supernatant was analyzed by immunochemiluminescent assay (CLIA) (Liaison®, Diasorin,
Torino, Italia).

Protein extraction and western blot analysis

Cell migration analysis

HepG2 and HuH-7 cell lines were plated into culture
dishes and grown to 70-80% confluence. After drug
treatment (30′) of FBS-stimulated cells, cells were lysed in
detergent buffer (1% NP-40, 10% Glycerol, 137mM NaCl,
20mM Tris pH7.6, 20mM NaF, 2μg/mL aprotinin, 2μg/
mL leupeptin, 2μg/mL pepstatin, 200μM Na3VO4, 1mM
PMSF) on ice for 30′. The homogenate was centrifuged for
15′, at 1200 x g and 4°C and the supernatant was collected
and stored at -80°C until use. Protein concentrations
were determined photometrically with a bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA).
After protein heat-denaturation at 95°C for 10′, 40μg of
total extracts were used for immunoblotting. Proteins
from cell preparations were separated by 8% (according

The in vitro scratch-wound healing assay was
used to study cell migration [55]. HepG2 and HuH-7
cells were seeded in poly-L-lysine pre-coated 12-well
plates and were grown until 100% confluence. At this
point, cells were exposed to 10−10M of SIR, 10−6M of
OSI-906, and a combination of them, in culture medium
containing a lower percentage of serum (1%), sufficient
to prevent apoptosis or cell detachment and to minimize
cell proliferation. After exposure, linear scratch-wounds
were made in the cell monolayer using a p200 tip.
Scratch wounds were then visualised using an inverted
microscope, Zeiss Axiovert 40c, and pictures were
captured by a digital camera, Canon power shot A640, at

then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for
1h in a TransBlot Amersham apparatus. After a blocking
treatment for 1h with 5% of milk, the nitrocellulose filters
were probed with primary antibodies specific for ERK1/2
(sc-7383 Santa Cruz, Italy), ERK2 (sc-1647 Santa Cruz,
Italy), pAKT (Ser 473) (#9271, Cell signalling, Italy),
AKT (#9272, Cell signalling, Italy), pp70S6k (#9206,Cell

were hybridated with peroxidise-conjugated secondary
antibodies and immunoreactive bands were detected by
ECL system. After chemiluminescent reaction, the blot
was exposed to ImageQuant Las 4000 (GE Healthcare).
The chemiluminescent signals of the appropriately sized
bands were measured using the ImageQuant Las 4000
image system software.
