ABSTRACT
The overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is closely
associated with the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in certain types of
cancer, which represents a formidable obstacle to the successful cancer chemotherapy.
Here, we investigated that cetuximab, an EGFR monoclonal antibody, reversed the
chemoresistance mediated by ABCB1, ABCG2 or ABCC1. Our results showed that
cetuximab significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of ABCB1 substrate agent in ABCB1overexpressing MDR cells but had no effect in their parental drug sensitive cells and
ABCC1, ABCG2 overexpressing cells. Furthermore, cetuximab markedly increased
intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin (DOX) and rhodamine 123 (Rho 123) in
ABCB1-overexpressing MDR cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner.
Cetuximab stimulated the ATPase activity but did not alter the expression level of
ABCB1 or block phosphorylation of AKT and ERK. Interestingly, cetuximab decreased
the cell membrane fluidity which was known to decrease the function of ABCB1.
Our findings advocate further clinical investigation of combination chemotherapy
of cetuximab and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in ABCB1 overexpressing
cancer patients.

pump leading to extrude a wide range of structurally
and mechanistically diverse anticancer drugs against
a concentration gradient, thereby resulting in chemo­
therapy failure [1]. To date, 49 different members of
ABC transporter family have been identified in the
human genome and are classified into seven subfamilies
(A–G) based on sequence similarities [2]. Among them,
ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 play major roles in the
development of MDR in cancer cells [3]. Overexpression
of ABCB1 on the surface of cancer cells is considered
as the most common explanation of MDR. ABCB1 can

INTRODUCTION
MDR is a well characterized broad pattern of
cross resistance to various structurally unrelated drugs
after exposure to a single drug, which is a formidable
barrier to the successful cancer chemotherapy. The
MDR phenotype can lead to increase of drug efflux
and inadequate induction of apoptosis. Up to now,
the mechanism associated with efflux of drugs has
focused on the overexpression of the superfamily of
ABC transporters that function as active drug efflux

pump out a wide spectrum of compounds including
vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, taxanes and some
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [4, 5]. On the other
hand, ABCB1 expression can be induced by drugexposure and eventually develop to MDR. A lot of MDR
inhibitors have been developed to reverse MDR, some
of which are being evaluated in clinical trials for their
potential circumvention of anticancer drug resistance
[6–11]. Unfortunately, no transporter inhibitors have been
put into use in the clinic because of insufficient efficacy,
unacceptable toxicity or unpredictable pharmacokinetic
interactions [12, 13].
As a lipid flippase, ABCB1 has complex interplay
with cell membrane and play major function by located
in the lipid rafts [14, 15]. The biological membrane
regulates the physical properties of membrane and
the functions of membrane proteins. In particular, the
changes in the cholesterol and the sphingomyelin on
the membrane can regulate ATP activity, drug binding
and transportation by altering the fluidity of the cell
membrane [14, 16]. Sinicrope and his colleagues
had shown that alteration of membrane lipid fluidity
of canalicular membrane vesicles modulated the
ABCB1-mediated accumulation of MDR-type drugs
[15]. But the expression of P-gp per se has little effect
on membrane fluidity or membrane potential [17].
What’s more, many reversal agents have proved to
change the fluidity of membrane by interacting with
the composition of membrane directly or indirectly.
Therefore, the function of ABCB1 has innumerable
links with the fluidity of membrane. Consequently, a
logical strategy to overcome ABC transporters-mediated
MDR is to develop inhibitors that could alter the fluidity
of membrane.
EGFR signal pathways are involved in the control
of cell survival, cell cycle, angiogenesis, migration,
invasion and metastatic potential of cells. Cetuximab is a
chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody of EGFR,
directly against EGFR, which binds to EGFR with an
affinity that is approximately five to ten times higher than
that of endogenous ligands. Cetuximab blocks binding
of endogenous EGFR ligands resulting in inhibition
of receptor function and induces EGFR internalization
[18]. In addition, cetuximab is given to patients treated
for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in combination
with irinotecan when irinotecan-based therapy had failed
[19]. The safety and efficacy of cetuximab combine
with irinotecan has been studied in patients with EGFRoverexpressing CRC and shown reliable efficacy in
clinical trial [19, 20]. However, the mechanism of this
combined therapy remains unknown. As irinotecan is
an ABCB1 substrate, here we try to explore the effect
of cetuximab on the reversal of MDR. According to a
recent study, activation of the EGFR signaling pathways

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

would up-regulate the ABC-transport protein expression
and increase the survival of resistant cells [21]. We
hypothesized that cetuximab could inhibit ABCB1
functionality through blocking EGFR signaling pathways.
Indeed, many studies had also proved that the action of
ABCB1 modulator appears to depend on the alteration
of cell membrane fluidizer. These spur intensified effort
to determine the role of cetuximab in the fluidity of
cell membrane. In this study, we investigated the effect
of cetuximab on the reversal of MDR induced by ABC
transporters.

RESULTS
ABC transporter was examined in cell lines
Western blot analysis confirmed that ABCB1 was
overexpression in KBv200, MCF-7/adr and HEK293/
ABCB1 cells, while undetectable expression levels were
exhibited in their parental drug sensitive KB, MCF-7 and
HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells; and ABCC1 and ABCG2 were
overexpression in HL60/adr and S1-MI-80 cells, but not
in their parental sensitive HL60 and S1 cells, respectively
(Figure 1).

Cetuximab enhanced the cytotoxicity of
conventional chemotherapeutic agent in ABCB1overexpressing cells
We investigated the cytotoxicity of cetuximabin
different cancer cells by MTT assay. Based on
the concentration-effect curve, more than 90% of
cells were viable under the concentrations of 250
μg/ml cetuximab in KBv200, MCF-7/adr and other
cell lines. So we selected the concentration of ≤ 250
μg/ml cetuximab to reverse MDR. The cytotoxicity of
ABCB1 substrate anticancer agent were detected in the
presence or absence of cetuximab in KB and KBv200
cells, MCF-7 and MCF-7/adr cells, HEK293/pcDNA3.1
and HEK293/ABCB1 cells, respectively. Cetuximab
exhibited a concentration-dependent decrease of the
IC50 values of DOX and paclitaxel in KBv200, MCF7/adr and HEK293/ABCB1 cells, but not increase the
sensitivity in their parental sensitive KB, MCF-7 and
HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells, respectively (Table 1). On
the other hand, cetuximab did not significantly enhance
the cytotoxicity of non-ABCB1 substrate agent such as
cisplatin, and also did not reverse ABCC1- or ABCG2mediated MDR (Table 1). These results indicate that
cetuximab is able to remarkably restore the sensitivity
of ABCB1-overexpressing cells to ABCB1 substrate
anticancer agent but has no effect on ABCC1-, ABCG2mediated MDR.

Cetuximab significantly increased the
accumulation of DOX and Rho 123 in cells

KBv200 and MCF-7/adr cells in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2). In contrast, the cellular retention
of DOX and Rho 123 were not altered in the parental

Taken together, these suggest that cetuximab inhibits the
ABCB1 function of extrusion drug out of cells.

It is well-known that the efflux of anticancer drug

accumulation and cell resistance. To investigate effect of
cetuximab on the function of ABCB1, the intracellular
accumulations of DOX and Rho 123 were examined
in the presence or absence of cetuximab in ABCB1overexpressing MDR cells and their parental drug sensitive
cells. The intracellular accumulation of DOX or Rho 123
in KB and MCF-7 cells was higher than their resistant

cetuximab (Figure 3). Cetuximab was found to stimulate
ABCB1 ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner
but have no obvious effect on the ABCG2 ATPase activity.

and phosphorylated forms of AKT and ERK in KB,
KBv200, MCF-7 and MCF-7/adr cells. Firstly, Western
blot confirmed that the EGFR expression level in KBv200
was higher than KB, but no difference between MCF-7/
adr and MCF-7 cells (Figure 6). As shown in Figure 7,
the p-EGFR level were slightly decreased after cetuximab
treatment, but it did not alter the total or phosphorylated
forms of AKT and ERK in KB, KBv200, MCF-7 and
MCF-7/adr cells, respectively. These results suggest that
MDR reversal effect of cetuximab is independent of the
blockades of AKT and ERK signal transduction pathways
in KBv200 and MCF-7/adr cells.

Cetuximab did not significantly alter the
expression of ABCB1 in protein or mRNA level
The inhibition of ABC transporter function could be
achieved by down-regulate the expression level of ABC
transporter. Hence, we explored the effects of cetuximab
on ABCB1 expression levels in mRNA and protein. Our
results showed that cetuximab did not significantly alter
the mRNA or protein level of ABCB1 in KBv200 and
MCF-7/adr cells (Figure 4). These results indicated that
the reversal of ABCB1-mediated MDR did not involve in
the inhibition of ABCB1 expression.

Cetuximab decreased the fluidity of tumor cell
membrane in MDR cells
The decrease of fluidity of tumor cell membrane
resulted in the inhibition of ABCB1 function [15, 17].
We used 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), a kind
of fluorescence probe, to mark the lipid located in the
membrane and the fluorescence polarization to determent
the fluidity of the membrane. Cetuximab was found to
increase the fluorescence polarization and reduce the
fluidity of the membrane in KBv200 and MCF-7/adr cells
moderately in a concentration-dependent manner (Table 2).
These results indicate that the inhibition of ABCB1 function
and reversal of MDR by cetuximab are associated with the
decrease the fluidity of membrane. Importantly, cetuximab
did not alter the fluorescence polarization and fluidity of the
membrane in the EGFR negative ABCB1 overexpressing
K562/adr cells (Figure 8A, 8B). Moreover, cetuximab failed
to enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX but verapamil could
do in ABCB1-overexpressing K562/adr cells (Figure 8C).
These indicate the reversal of ABCB1-mediated MDR by
cetuximab depends on EGFR expression.

Interaction between ABCB1 and EGFR was not
observed by co-immunoprecipitation
In the previous study, cetuximab combines with
EGFR can induce EGFR endocytosis and finally inhibit
the function of EGFR signaling pathway. Here we
hypothesis that cetuximab binding to EGFR may result
in ABCB1 endocytosis after EGFR interact with ABCB1.
Co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to detect the
interaction between EGFR and ABCB1 after cetuximab
treatment. The interaction between ABCB1 and EGFR was
not observed in presence of cetuximab (Figure 5A). On the
other hand, ABCB1 expression did not reduce in presence
of cetuximab by Flow cytometry (Figure 5B, 5C).

Cetuximab did not block the phosphorylation of
AKT and ERK at MDR reversal concentrations

cells [22]. To determine whether the cetuximab used in

ABC transporters, especially by ABCB1, ABCC1 and
ABCG2, has been reported as important contributing
factor to the development of MDR [24, 25]. Current
strategies against MDR are to reverse MDR or prevent

from MDR by MDR inhibitors. In the recent years, one
potential finding is that the combination of cetuximab
and irrnotecan is likely to have an additional beneficial
effect in colorectal cancers. Indeed, the safety and efficacy

of cetuximab combine with irinotecan has been studied
in patients with EGFR-overexpressing CRC, and have
shown reliable efficacy in clinic [19]. However, the
mechanism of this combined therapy remains unknown.
As we know irinotecan is an ABCB1 substrate, we
hypothesized that cetuximab could effectively compete
with chemotherapeutic agent binding to ABCB1 and thus
increase intracellular drug accumulation in resistant cancer
cells.
We found that cetuximab could increase the
sensitivity of ABCB1-overexpressing cells to substrate
chemotherapeutic agent in a concentration-dependent
manner, but did not potentiate the cytotoxicity of nonsubstrate chemotherapeutic agent such as cisplatin.
Importantly, cetuximab did not enhance the efficacy of
chemotherapeutic agent in their parental drug sensitive
cells. On the other hand, cetuximab couldn’t increase
the cytotoxicity of topotecan in ABCG2 overexpressing
S1-MI-80 cells and the cytotoxicity of DOX in ABCC1
overexpressing HL60/adr cells. These demonstrate
cetuximab could reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR
but not to ABCC1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR. The
extrusion anticancer drug out of the cells and the
decrease of intracellular accumulation of anticancer
drug was linked to MDR occurring. Drug accumulation
and efflux were measured by flow cytometry. We
found that cetuximab inhibited the efflux capacity of
ABCB1 and increased intracellular accumulation of
chemotherapeutic agent in a concentration-dependent
manner in MDR cells. Therefore, the ability of
cetuximab to reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR may be
explained by the inhibitory effect on the drug efflux
function of ABCB1.
Extrusion of drug out of MDR cells by ABCB1
is dependent on energy support via ATP hydrolysis by

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ATPase [5]. So we detected the activities of ABCB1
and ABCG2 ATPases in the presence or absence of
cetuximab. We found cetuximab significantly stimulated
ABCB1 ATPase activity but only slightly increased
ABCG2 ATPase activity. Some MDR inhibitors could
down-regulate ABC transporter expression and reverse
MDR [26]. To identify the effect of cetuximab on
ABCB1 expression level, the mdr1 mRNA and ABCB1
protein were examined by q-PCR and Western blot,
respectively. Cetuximab did not change the expression
of ABCB1 at both the protein and mRNA levels. It
had been reported that cetuximab could induce EGFR
internalization [27]. Whether EGFR interacts with
ABCB1 and induce its endocytosis in the presence of
cetuximab? The co-immunoprecipitation assay showed
that there is no interaction between EGFR and ABCB1 in
the presence or absence of cetuximab. On the other hand,
we did not observed ABCB1 downregulation by Flow
cytometry examination (Figure 5B, 5C). This indicates
that the reversal of MDR by cetuximab at the reverse
concentrations do not link to ABCB1 endocytosis. Chen et al.
reported that cetuximab decrease cell membrane fluidity
by regulating EGFR trafficking/turnover and facilitating
a switch from lipid rafts to clathrin-mediated endocytosis
[28]. This suggests the decrease of cell membrane fluidity
is dependent on the binding of cetuximab and EGFR.
Furthermore, it was also reported that the alteration of
cell membrane fluidity inhibited the ABCB1 function of
extrusion drug out of MDR cells [29]. The change of the
membrane fluidity inhibits the function of ABCB1 [30].
We found that the membrance fluidity was decreased after
treated with cetuximab in MDR cells, which was linked to
the inhibition of ABCB1 function. Interestingly, we found
cetuximab could increase the fluorescence polarization
and reduce the fluidity of the membrane in KBv200 and

cetuximab probably depends on EGFR to decrease the cell
membrane fluidity and further inhibit ABCB1 function
(Figure 9).
In summary, cetuximab could enhance the
cytotoxicity of conventional anticancer agent in ABCB1overexpressing cancer cells by decreasing fluidity of
MDR cell membrane and inhibiting the drug transport

function and increasing intracellular accumulation of
chemotherapeutic agent, but not involving in alteration
of ABCB1 expression and the blockade of AKT and
ERK signal transduction pathways in EGFR expression
MDR cells. These findings encourage combinational
chemotherapy of cetuximab and conventional anticancer
drugs in EGFR expression MDR cancer patients.

Figure 9: Mechanism of cetuximab reversing MDR. When absence of cetuximab, EGF or TGFα can bind to the EGFR resulting

in phosphorylation of EGFR and activation of EGFR signaling pathways. As a lipid flippase, ABCB1 has complex interplay with cell
membrane and play major function by located in the lipid rafts A. However, at the presence of cetuximab, it can block the binding
of endogenous EGFR ligands leading to the inhibition of receptor function and induce EGFR internalization. Cetuximab decrease cell
membrane fluidity by regulating EGFR trafficking/turnover and facilitating a switch from lipid rafts to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The
change of the membrane fluidity inhibits the function of ABCB1. As a result, alteration of cell membrane fluidity inhibited the ABCB1
function of extrusion drug out of MDR cells B. Thus, cetuximab can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agent in ABCB1 mediatedMDR cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

DOX and Rho 123 accumulation

Chemicals and reagents

The accumulations of DOX and Rho 123 were
measured by flow cytometry as previously described [32].
Briefly, the cells were treated with cetuximab of various
concentrations or vehicle at 37°C for 3 h. Then 10 μM
DOX or 5 μM Rho 123 was added and incubation was
continued for additional 3 h or 0.5 h, respectively. The cells
were then collected, washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, and
analyzed by Flow cytometry analysis (Beckman Coulter,
CytomicsFC500, USA). VRP, an ABCB1 inhibitor, was
used as a positive control.

Cetuximab was purchased from Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharma GmbH & Co. KG. Monoclonal antibodies against
ABCB1, AKT, p-AKT, ERK, p-ERK and EGFR were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA).
Monoclonal antibody against p-EGFR and BIM were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).
Flow cytometry antibody against ABCB1 and IgG2α
were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA).
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
antibody was purchased from Kangchen Co. (Shanghai,
China). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased from Life
Technologies, Inc. Rho 123, 1-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,
5-diphenylformazan (MTT), paclitaxel, DOX, verapamil
(VRP), vincristine (VCR), topotecan, cisplatin, MK571,
fumitremorgin C (FTC) and other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO).

ABCB1 and ABCG2 ATPase activity assay
A colorimetric ATPase assay was performed as
previously described with minor modification [39].
Briefly, crude membranes isolated from High Five insect
cells expressing either ABCB1 or ABCG2 (100 μg protein/
mL) were incubated at 37°C with a range of different
concentrations of cetuximab in the presence or absence
of sodium orthovanadate (0.3 μM for ABCB1 and 1.2 μM
for ABCG2) in ATPase assay buffer (50 mMKCl, 5 mM
sodium azide, 2 mMEDTA, 10 mMMgCl2, 1 mMDTT,
pH 6.8) for 5 min. The crude membranes were kind gift
provided by Dr Suresh Ambudkar (National Cancer
Institute, NIH, USA). ATP hydrolysis reaction was then
started by the addition of 5 mM Mg-ATP (concentration
in a final volume of 60 μL) and incubated for 20 min (for
ABCB1) or 10 min (for ABCG2). SDS solution (30 μL of
10% SDS) was then added to terminate the reaction. After
the addition of a detection reagent (35 mM ammonium
molybdate, 15 mM zinc acetate, 10% ascorbic acid) and
incubation at 37°C for 20 min, absorbance was measured
at 750 nm. The amount of inorganic phosphate released
was estimated by reading from a standard curve. Specific
cetuximab-stimulated ABCB1 and ABCG2 ATPase
activity (i.e. vanadate-sensitive) was determined as the
difference between the amounts of inorganic phosphate
released from ATP in the absence and presence of sodium
orthovanadate.

Cell lines and cell culture
The following cell lines were cultured in DMEM
or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2: the human oral
epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB and its VCR-selected
ABCB1-overexpressing derivative KBv200 [31]; the
human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and its DOXselected ABCB1-overexpressing derivative MCF-7/adr
[32]; the human leukemia cell line K562 and its DOXselected ABCB1-overexpressing derivative cell line K562/
adr [33]; the human colon carcinoma cell lines S1 and its
mitoxantrone (MX)-selected ABCG2-overexpressing
derivative S1-MI-80 [34]; the human leukemia cell lines
HL60 and its DOX-selected ABCC1-overexpressing
derivative HL60/adr [35] and the human primary
embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and its pcDNA3.1,
ABCB1 stable gene-transfected HEK293/pcDNA3.1 and
HEK293/ABCB1 (cultured in medium with 2 mg/ml G418
[36]) cell lines, respectively. All cells were grown in drug
free culture medium for more than 2 weeks before assay.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed following
a modification of methods described earlier [40]. To
determine whether cetuximab affects the expression of
ABCB1, EGFR, AKT, ERK, the phosphorylation of
EGFR, AKT and ERK, the cells were treated with a range
of different concentrations of cetuximab for 48 h.

Cell cytotoxicity assay
The MTT assay was performed as described
previously to assess the sensitivity of cells to anticancer
drugs [37]. The concentration required to inhibit cell
growth by 50% (IC50) was calculated from survival curves
using the Bliss method [38]. The degree of resistance was
estimated by dividing the IC50 for the MDR cells by that
of the parental sensitive cells; the fold-reversal factor of
MDR was calculated by dividing the IC50 of the anticancer
drug in the absence of cetuximab by that obtained in the
presence of cetuximab.

Flow cytometry analysis
Flow cytometry analysis was performed as
described previously [41]. Expression of ABCB1 in the
cell lines KBv200 and MCF-7/adr were measured by

40862

Oncotarget

Flow cytometry after treated with a range of different
concentrations of cetuximab for 48 h. Single-cell
suspensions were prepared and washed three times with
chilled PBS (supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum
albumin). Then, 10 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated, mouse
anti-human ABCB1 antibody was mixed with 25 μl of
cells (4 × 106 cells per ml). After incubation in the dark for
45 min at 4°C, the cells were washed twice with chilled
PBS (supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and
were resuspended in 400 μl of PBS for Flow cytometry
analysis. Isotype control samples were treated in an
identical manner with phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse
IgG2α for ABCB1.

to minimize nonspecific binding. Then the precleared
supernatant was divided into three parts, two of which
were incubated with 2 μg of anti-EGFR antibody or
anti-IgG antibody for 1  h at 4°C separately, followed
by incubation with protein G-agarose beads overnight
at 4°C. The bound proteins were washed thrice with lysis
buffer and dissociated with the beads via boiling and
centrifugation. The collected proteins were suspended in
1 × protein loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by Western blot using the primary antibody of
anti-ABCB1.

PCR and real-time quantitative PCR

A Fluidity of tumor cell membrane assay was
performed as Sinicrope FA et.al. described with minor
modification [45]. The cells in logarithmic growth phase
were treated with cetuximab of various concentrations at
37°C for 24 h. Then the cells were then collected, washed
3 times with ice-cold PBS. With the number of cells thus
obtained, a cell suspension with 107/mL was made. A 2 mL
of the 4 mL tumor cell suspension was taken and added to
a test tube as the blank tube, while the test tube containing
the remaining 2 mL of the red cell suspension was used
for reference. A 2 mL of DPH probe solution was added
to the reference tube, while the same amount of isotonic
PBS buffer solution was added to the blank tube. Solution in
the two tubes was mixed and incubated for 30 min under a
temperature of 25°C and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1500
r/min. The remaining DPH probe solution was discarded,
and the residue was rinsed twice with isotonic PBS buffer
solution and then diluted into 4 mL of cell suspension with
isotonic PBS buffer solution. Immediately after this, the
fluorescence polarization of the residue was measured.
Spectra Max M Seriel Multiscan Spectrum was used to
measure the intensity P of fluorescence polarized light both
when it was parallel to and when it was perpendicular to the
direction of vibration of the excitation polarized light, at a
fluorescence excitation wavelength of 362 nm, a radiation
wavelength of 432 nm, and under a temperature of 25°C.

Fluidity of tumor cell membrane assay

ABCB1 expression in mRNA level was assayed as
previously described [40]. After a series of concentrations
and different time periods of cetuximab treatment, total
cellular RNA was isolated by trizol reagent RNA extraction
kit following the manufacturer’s instruction (Molecular
Research Center, USA). The first strand cDNA was
synthesized by OligodT primers with reverse transcriptase
(Promega Corp. Madison, WI). The PCR primers were
5’-CAGGCTTGCTGTAATTACCCA-3’(forward) and
5’-TCAAAGAAACAACGGTTCGG-3’(reverse)
for
ABCB1; 5’-GAGTCAAGGATTTGGTCGT-3’(forward)
and 5’-GATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATG-3’(reverse) for
GAPDH, respectively. After 35 cycles of amplification,
products were resolved and examined by 1.0% agarose
gel electrophoresis.
Real-time PCR was performed with Real-time PCR
Master Mix containing SYBR GREEN I and hotStartTaq
DNA polymerase. Real-time detection of the emission
intensity of SYBR GREEN bound to double-stranded
DNAs was performed using the iCycler Instrument (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The level of ABCB1 mRNA
was expressed as a ratio relative to the GAPDH mRNA
in each sample. Relative quantification of ABCB1 was
performed using the 2 −ΔΔCt method [42]. The results were
obtained from three reactions in each sample and analyzed
by the SPSS software (Version 11.0) (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA).

Statistics
Results were shown as means ± SD. All experiments
were repeated at least three times and the differences were
determined by using the Student’s t-test. The statistical
significance was determined to be P < 0.05.

Co-immunoprecipitation assay
The co-immunoprecipitation assay was previously
described with minor modification [43]. After KBv200
and MCF-7/adr cells were treated with a range of
different concentrations of cetuximab for 48 h. The cells
were lysed in RIPA solution. The lysates were centrifuged
at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants were
collected and total protein amount was measured using
the BCA method [44]. For co-immunoprecipitation,
the supernatant of cell lysate corresponding to 1 mg of
total protein was precleared by Protein G-agarose beads
