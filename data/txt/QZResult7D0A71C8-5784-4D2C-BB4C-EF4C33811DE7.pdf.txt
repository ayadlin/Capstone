Abstract
Micellar nanoparticles based on linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) block dendritic cholic acids (CA) copolymers
(telodendrimers), for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of cancers, are reported.
The micellar nanoparticles have been decorated with a high-afﬁnity "OA02" peptide against a-3 integrin receptor
to improve the tumor-targeting speciﬁcity which is overexpressed on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. "Click
chemistry" was used to conjugate alkyne-containing OA02 peptide to the azide group at the distal terminus of the
PEG chain in a representative PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer (micelle-forming unit). The conjugation of OA02 peptide
had negligible inﬂuence on the physicochemical properties of PEG5k-CA8 nanoparticles and as hypothesized,
OA02 peptide dramatically enhanced the uptake efﬁciency of PEG5k-CA8 nanoparticles (NP) in SKOV-3 and ES-2
ovarian cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, but not in a-3 integrin-negative K562 leukemia cells.
When loaded with paclitaxel, OA02-NPs had signiﬁcantly higher in vitro cytotoxicity against both SKOV-3 and ES2 ovarian cancer cells as compared with nontargeted nanoparticles. Furthermore, the in vivo biodistribution study
showed OA02 peptide greatly facilitated tumor localization and the intracellular uptake of PEG5k-CA8 nanoparticles into ovarian cancer cells as validated in SKOV3-luc tumor–bearing mice. Finally, paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded
OA02-NPs exhibited superior antitumor efﬁcacy and lower systemic toxicity proﬁle in nude mice bearing SKOV-3
tumor xenografts, when compared with equivalent doses of nontargeted PTX-NPs as well as clinical paclitaxel
formulation (Taxol). Therefore, OA02-targeted telodendrimers loaded with paclitaxel have great potential as a
new therapeutic approach for patients with ovarian cancer. Cancer Res; 72(8); 2100–10. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the ninth most common cancer, with an
estimated 22,280 new cases in 2012, but is the ﬁfth most deadly,
with an estimated 15,500 deaths in 2012 (1). The standard
treatment for patients with advanced-stage disease usually

involves surgical staging and debulking followed by adjuvant
chemotherapy, typically with platinum and paclitaxel (PTX).
However, the more extensive use of chemotherapeutic drugs
such as paclitaxel is often limited by its severe side effects,
including hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, and
neurotoxicity, which may be attributed to their nonspeciﬁc
systemic organ distribution and inadequate intratumor concentrations, resulting in suboptimal efﬁcacy (2, 3). Despite the
intensive chemotherapy, more than 70% of patients with
ovarian cancer will suffer from disease relapse or recurrence,
and ultimately die of this disease. Therefore, there is a tremendous incentive to reﬁne existing treatment modalities to
avoid or delay the recurrence and to treat recurrent ovarian
cancer more effectively. Optimization of chemotherapeutic
drug delivery is among the critical approaches to improve the
therapeutic index of cytotoxic agents.
Nanotechnology is an emerging ﬁeld that has shown great
promise in the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic agents for a variety of diseases, including cancers (4). As
the vasculature in tumors is known to be leaky, and the tumor
lymphatic system is also deﬁcient, nanoparticles can preferentially accumulate in the tumor site via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects (5). Polymeric micelles
represent one of the most promising nanocarriers due to their
unique core-shell structure formed by amphiphilic block

A Novel Targeted Nanotherapeutics against Ovarian Cancer

copolymers, which could facilitate the solublization of poorly
soluble drugs and protect the drugs from degradation and
metabolism. We have recently developed a series of novel
linear dendritic block copolymers (telodendrimers) comprising polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dendritic cholic acids (CA),
which can encapsulate high concentrations of hydrophobic
drugs such as paclitaxel and self-assemble to form stable coreshell micelles under aqueous condition (6–12). The representative PEG5k-CA8 micellar nanoparticles possess the ideal
properties for drug delivery, including high drug loading
capacity, optimal particle size (20–60 nm), outstanding stability (more than 6 months at 4 C), and sustainable drug release
proﬁle. Paclitaxel-loaded PEG5k-CA8 nanoparticles have been
shown to exhibit superior antitumor efﬁcacy and toxicity
proﬁle than free drug (Taxol) and paclitaxel/human serum
albumin nanoaggregate (Abraxane) at equivalent paclitaxel
doses, in nude mice bearing human ovarian cancer (SKOV-3)
xenografts (6).
To further facilitate the residence, penetration, and cancer
cell uptake of delivered drugs within the tumor sites for more
efﬁcient cancer treatment, an attractive approach is to decorate the nanoparticles surface with targeting ligands that
speciﬁcally recognize receptors on cancer cells (active targeting). Active targeting might result in higher retention of
nanoparticles drugs at tumor sites (i.e., by reducing passive
transport away from tumor) and enhanced uptake of the drugs
by cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (13–15).
Furthermore, actively targeted nanoparticles have also shown
the potential to overcome multidrug resistance via bypassing
of P-glycoprotein–mediated drug efﬂux (16). Combining passive and active targeting in a single platform will further
improve the therapeutic index of nanocarrier delivered drugs
(17, 18). A wide variety of targeting ligands, including antibodies and single-chain Fv fragment (19, 20), peptides (21, 22),
small molecules (23), and aptamers (24, 25) have been used
with varying degrees of success to functionalize nanoparticles
for their potential application in targeted cancer therapy.
Although antibodies or antibody fragments are effective as
targeting agents, there are some innate problems such as
decreased receptor afﬁnity as a result of conjugation methods,
potential immunogenicity, nonspeciﬁc uptake by reticuloendothelial system, and relative poor stability (17). In contrast,
peptides or peptidomimetics with high binding afﬁnity and
speciﬁcity to cancer cells may have many favorable characteristics, including deep tumor penetration due to the smaller
size, lack of immunogenicity, easy synthesis and scale-up, and
good stability especially if D-conﬁguration and unnatural amino acids are used (26).
Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane
glycoproteins involved in a wide range of cell-to-extracellular
matrix (ECM) and cell-to-cell interactions (27, 28). It has been
found that integrins are overexpressed on various cell types
such as angiogenic endothelial cells and certain cancer cells.
For example, a-3 integrin is overexpressed in several types of
cancers, especially ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma (29). The overexpression of a-3 integrin on these cancer
cells has been exploited as a promising pharmacologic target
for the selective drug delivery in the treatment of these cancers.

www.aacrjournals.org

In addition, during the cell locomotion and migration, integrins can undergo endocytosis after the activation with anchoring ligands, which may facilitate the intracellular delivery of
nanoparticles drugs into cancer cells, when these nanoparticles are decorated with integrin-targeting ligands. A highafﬁnity a-3 integrin-targeting peptide "OA02" has been identiﬁed in our laboratory through screening one-bead one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial peptide libraries (30). This
"OA02" peptide has been shown to bind strongly to a-3
integrin–overexpressing ovarian cancer cells and speciﬁcally
target ovarian cancer xenografts (ES-2) in nude mice when
conjugated to near-infrared ﬂuorescence (NIRF) dyes (30).
In the present study, we hypothesize that the incorporation
of "OA02" peptide ligand onto our newly developed micellar
nanoparticles (NP) will facilitate the precise homing of drug
payload to a-3 integrin–overexpressing ovarian cancer cells.
First, the alkyne-modiﬁed "OA02" peptide was synthesized and
conjugated to the azide-functionalized PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer via copper-catalyzed cyloaddition ("click chemistry").
Then, the binding speciﬁcity, uptake efﬁciency, and in vivo
tumor–targeting property of ﬂuorescence-labeled OA02-NPs
were evaluated in human ovarian cancer cells and xenograft
mouse model, respectively. Finally, the antitumor effect of
paclitaxel-loaded OA02-NPs against ovarian cancer was studied both in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Diamino PEG was purchased from Rapp Polymere. Cy5.5
Mono NHS ester was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.
Hydrophobic ﬂuorescence dye DiD (1,10 -dioctadecyl-3,3,30 ,30 tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate, D-307), 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and LysoTracker Red were
purchased from Invitrogen. Paclitaxel was purchased from AK
Scientiﬁc Inc. Taxol (Mayne Pharma) was obtained from the
UC Davis Cancer Center Pharmacy. Cholic acid, MTT, and
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and all other chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Synthesis of OA02-conjugated PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer
Boc-NH-PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer was ﬁrst synthesized as
described previously (6). N3-PEG5k-CA8 was obtained by the
coupling of 4-azidobutyric acid NHS ester to the terminus of
PEG after deprotecting Boc group of Boc-NH-PEG5k-CA8 with
50% (v/v) triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane. The
telodendrimer was then dialyzed and ﬁnally lyophilized.
Alkyne-modiﬁed OA02 peptide (cdG-HoCit-GPQc-Ebes-Kalkyne) was synthesized via solid-phase synthesis on FmocRink Amide MBHA Resins using the standard Fmoc chemistry
as described previously (30). 5-Hexynoic acid was coupled onto
the e-amino group of lysine on the peptide. Alkyne-modiﬁed
OA02 peptide was conjugated to the N3-PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer via CuI-catalyzed cyloaddition (21). The conjugation
was conﬁrmed by the amino acid analysis (AAA). The molecular structure and molecular weight of OA02-PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer were measured by 1H-NMR (nuclear magnetic
resonance) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–

time-of-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS),
respectively.
FITC- or Cy5.5-labeled telodendrimers were synthesized
by coupling FITC or Cy5.5 NHS ester to the amino group of
the proximal lysine between PEG and cholic acid after the
removal of Dde protecting group by 2% (v/v) hydrazine in
dimethylformamide.
Preparation and characterization of paclitaxel-loaded
OA02-NPs
Paclitaxel-loaded OA02-NPs (PTX-OA02-NPs) were prepared using the mixture (1:1) of blank PEG5k-CA8 and OA02PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimers via a dry-down (evaporation) method as described previously (6). To determine the amount of
paclitaxel loaded in the nanoparticles, paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (1:9, v/v) and
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). The encapsulation efﬁciency (EE) was calculated
according to the following formula:
EE (%) ¼ (mass of paclitaxel encapsulated in nanoparticles/
mass of paclitaxel added)  100%
The morphology, particle size distribution, and zeta potential of PTX-OA02-NPs were characterized by cryo-transmission
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and dynamic light scattering
(DLS, Microtrac), respectively. The in vitro drug release kinetics
from PTX-OA02-NPs was measured by the dialysis method.
Brieﬂy, aliquots of PTX-OA02-NPs solution were injected into
dialysis cartridges with the molecular weight cutoff value of 3.5
kDa. The cartridges were dialyzed against 1 L PBS and shaken
at 37 C at 100 rpm with activated charcoal to create an ideal
sink condition. The concentration of paclitaxel remained in the
dialysis cartridge at different time points were measured by
HPLC.
Cell culture and animals
SKOV-3, ES-2, and K562 cells were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection. SKOV3-luc cells were obtained from
Caliper Life Sciences. All these cancer cell lines were authenticated by the suppliers and passaged in the laboratory for
fewer than 6 months after resuscitation. Cells were maintained
in a 37 C/5% CO2 humidiﬁed chamber in McCoy's 5A (SKOV-3,
ES-2, and SKOV3-luc) or RPMI-1640 (K562) media supplemented with 10% FBS.
Female nude mice, 6 to 8 weeks age, were purchased from
Harlan Laboratories. All animal protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ovarian
cancer xenograft mouse model was established by subcutaneously injecting 5  106 SKOV-3/SKOV3-luc cells in a 100 mL of
mixture of PBS and Matrigel (1:1, v/v) at the right ﬂank in
female nude mice.
Confocal microscopy
SKOV-3 and ES-2 cells were seeded in 8-well chamber slides.
When the cells were almost conﬂuent, cells were incubated
with 2 mmol/L FITC ﬂuorescent-labeled nanoparticles and
OA02-NPs for 2 hours at 37 C with 5% CO2, respectively. Then,
cells were washed 3 times with cold PBS, ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, and the nuclei were counter-

stained by DAPI. The slides were mounted with coverslips and
observed by Olympus FV1000 confocal microscopy. In another
set of experiment, excess amount of a-3 integrin antibody or
free OA02 peptide (200 mmol/L) were added into the medium
30 minutes before the incubation of 2 mmol/L FITC-labeled
OA02-NPs with cells, followed by the same procedure as earlier.
Flow cytometry
To show the overexpression of a-3 integrin, SKOV-3 and ES2 cells were incubated with Alex Fluor 488–conjugated a-3
integrin antibody (Chemicon International, 1:500) for 30 minutes at 4 C, followed by PBS wash twice, and then resuspended
in PBS for the ﬂow cytometric analysis.
SKOV-3, ES-2, and K562 (a-3 integrin negative) cells were
incubated with 2 mmol/L FITC-labeled nanoparticles or OA02NPs for 2 hours at 37 C, respectively. Then the cells were
washed with PBS 3 times and resuspended in PBS for the ﬂow
cytometric analysis. A total of 10, 000 events were collected for
each sample. For peptide inhibition experiments, free OA02
peptides with the ﬁnal concentration from 2 to 200 mmol/L
were added into the medium 30 minutes before the incubation
of 2 mmol/L FITC-labeled nanoparticles or OA02-NPs with
cells.
Intracellular tracking of OA02-NPs in live ovarian cancer
cells
To simultaneously track the payload and carrier of OA02NPs, DiD dyes were encapsulated as drug surrogates into FITCconjugated OA02-NPs. SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells were
seeded in the coverglass chamber slides. After reaching 80%
conﬂuence, cells were incubated with DiD/FITC dual-labeled
OA02-NPs. After 1.5 hours, LysoTracker Red (50 nmol/L) was
added in the medium and the cells were further incubated for
another 30 minutes (31). Then, the live cells were observed
under the Olympus FV1000 confocal microscopy.
MTT assay
MTT assay was used to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of
blank/paclitaxel-loaded nontargeted nanoparticles and OA02NPs against ovarian cancer cells (32). Cells were treated with
blank/paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles and OA02-NPs, respectively. After 2 hours of treatment, cells were washed with PBS 3
times, and fresh media were replaced in the plates. At 72 hours,
MTT was added to each well and further incubated for another
4 hours. The absorbance at 570 nm with a reference wavelength
of 660 nm was detected with a microplate reader. Untreated
cells served as a control. Results were shown as the average cell
viability [(ODtreat  ODblank)/(ODcontrol  ODblank)  100%] of
triplicate wells.
In vivo and ex vivo NIRF optical imaging
Nude mice bearing subcutaneous SKOV3-luc tumors were
intravenously injected with 4 nmol/L Cy5.5 ﬂuorescent-labeled
nanoparticles and OA02-NPs, respectively. At different time
point (0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours) postinjection, mice were
scanned with Kodak imaging system IS2000MM. At 24 hours,
tumors and major organs were excised for ex vivo imaging. For
the microscopic analysis, excised tumors were frozen in

corresponding slices (10 mm) were prepared, air dried for 10
minutes, and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. The a-3 integrin expression in the tumor section was
stained by Alex Fluor 488–conjugated a-3 integrin antibody
(1:500) for 1 hour at room temperature. The blood vessel was
stained by rat anti-mouse CD31 primary antibody (Millipore,
1:100) for 1 hour and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG
secondary antibody (Millipore, 1:1,500) for 1 hour at room
temperature.
Therapeutic study
The antitumor efﬁcacy and toxicity proﬁles of different
paclitaxel formulations were evaluated in the subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer. The
treatment was initiated when tumor volume reached 100 to
200 mm3 and this day was designated as day 0. The
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Taxol in mice is approximately 10 mg/kg (6, 33), and the micellar formulations of
paclitaxel were expected to be better tolerated than Taxol
according to our previous report (6). Mice were adminis-

trated intravenously with PBS, Taxol (10 mg/kg), PTX-NPs
(10, 30 mg/kg), and PTX-OA02-NPs (10, 30 mg/kg), respectively (n ¼ 8–10). The dosage was given every 3 days for a
total of 6 doses. Tumor sizes were measured with a digital
caliper twice per week. Tumor volume was calculated by
the formula (L  W2)/2, where L is the longest and W is
the shortest in tumor diameters (mm). Relative tumor
volume (RTV) equals the tumor volume at given time point
divided by the tumor volume before initial treatment. For
humane reasons, animals were sacriﬁced when the
implanted tumor volume reached 1,500 mm3, which was
considered as the end point of survival data. Survival rate
was analyzed using a Kaplan–Meier plot. The potential
toxicities after treatment were monitored by the animal
behavior observation and the body weight measurement
twice per week.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted by the Student t test for
comparison of 2 groups, and one-way ANOVA for multiple
groups, followed by Newman–Keuls test if overall P < 0.05.

conjugation of OA02 peptide to the telodendrimer. The
molar ratio of OA02 peptide to telodendrimer was almost
1:1, which meant that there was approximately one targeting
peptide molecule per telodendrimer monomer. The molecular weight of OA02-PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer was measured with MALDI-TOF MS. The monodispersed mass trace
was detected, and its molecular weight from MALDI-TOF
MS was almost identical to the theoretical value (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The chemical structure of OA02-PEG5kCA8 telodendrimer was also determined by 1H-NMR spectrometry. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2B, the signals at
0.6 to 1.3 and 3.5 to 3.7 ppm could be assigned to cholic acids
and PEG chains, respectively. The 1H-NMR signals of OA02
peptide were overlapped with the signals from the telodendrimers, and no distinguishable signal was observed.
Preparation and characterization of paclitaxel-loaded
OA02-PEG5k-CA8 nanoparticles
The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of OA02-PEG5kCA8 telodendrimer was found to be comparable with that of
blank PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer, with the range of 6 to 12
mmol/L (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating its

excellent micelle-forming property. Using the dry-down method, hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel can be readily encapsulated into the core of micellar nanoparticles. When the
feeding ratio of drug paclitaxel/telodendrimer (w/w) was
1:4, the encapsulation efﬁciency of PEG5k-CA8 nanoparticles
and OA02-PEG5k-CA8 nanoparticles were approximately 92%
and 96%, respectively. To enable the developed nanoparticles
to possess both antibiofouling ("stealth") and cell-speciﬁc–
targeting properties (34), OA02-PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer was
mixed with blank PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer (1:1, w/w) to
prepare PTX-OA02-NPs for the subsequent cell and animal
studies (Fig. 1B). The cryo-TEM image (Fig. 2A) showed that
PTX-OA02-NPs were spherical, with uniform particle sizes of
around 50 nm in diameter, which was similar with the result
obtained from DLS measurement (Fig. 2B). The zeta potential
of PTX-OA02-NPs in PBS was almost neutral (0.64 mV). The
stability of PTX-OA02-NPs was evaluated by measuring the
changes of particle sizes over time at different conditions. PTXOA02-NPs were found to be very stable at 4 C for more than 3
months, and also stable at 37 C for at least 72 hours when
incubated with 50% FBS (data not shown), which indicated
that they will likely be able to maintain their stability and

Figure 4. A, intracellular tracking of dual ﬂuorescent-labeled OA02-NPs
upon their uptake in live SKOV-3 cells. DiD dye (red) was encapsulated as
drug surrogates into FITC (green) covalently labeled OA02-NPs. SKOV-3
cells were incubated with DiD/FITC dual-labeled OA02-NPs for 2 hours,
and the cells were stained with lysosome tracker (red) before the live-cell

integrity during their in vivo applications. The drug release
pattern from PTX-OA02-NPs was similar with that from PTXNPs, which both were biphasic, with the initial rapid release of
paclitaxel during the ﬁrst 4 hours, followed by the slow linear
release over the subsequent few days (Fig. 2C). In summary, the
decoration of OA02 peptide had negligible impact on the
physicochemical properties of PEG5k-CA8 nanoparticles,
including CMC, morphology, particle size, drug-loading capacity, encapsulation efﬁciency, stability, and drug release proﬁle.
This is probably because the OA02 peptide conjugation occurs
at the distal end of PEG chain which is located on the shell of
self-assembled micellar nanoparticles without interfering with
the drug-holding hydrophobic core unit.
Cellular uptake studies
a-3 Integrin was showed to be overexpressed on both SKOV3 and ES-2 cells, as measured by the ﬂow cytometric analysis

(Supplementary Fig. S4). The uptake proﬁles of FITC-labeled
OA02-NPs in ovarian cancer cells were ﬁrst qualitatively
observed by the confocal microscopy. Nontargeted nanoparticles had minimal nonspeciﬁc cellular uptake after 2-hour
incubation, whereas the decoration of OA02 peptide greatly
increased the extent of nanoparticles uptake in both SKOV-3
(Fig. 3A) and ES-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Most FTIClabeled nanoparticles (green) distributed around the perinuclear region, which meant that these nanoparticles were internalized into the cytoplasm. More importantly, the uptake of
OA02-NPs in both ovarian cancer cells was able to be remarkably inhibited by excess amount of a-3 integrin antibody or free
OA02 peptide, suggesting the a-3 integrin receptor-dependent
internalization of OA02-NPs.
The uptake efﬁciencies of FITC-labeled OA02-NPs in ovarian
cancer cells and K562 leukemia cells (a-3 integrin negative)
were further quantitatively measured by the ﬂow cytometric
analysis. Both nontargeted nanoparticles and OA02-NPs had
similar low nonspeciﬁc uptake in K562 cells (Fig. 3B). However,
OA02-NPs exhibited signiﬁcantly higher uptake than the nontargeted nanoparticles in both ovarian cancer cells (P < 0.05),
with almost 6-fold higher uptake in SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 3C) and
4-fold higher uptake in ES-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B),
respectively. The addition of free OA02 peptide was able to
inhibit the uptake of OA02-NPs in SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 3D) and
ES-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C) in a dose-dependent
manner, further conﬁrming the a-3 integrin–targeting speciﬁcity of OA02-NPs. It should be noted that signiﬁcantly higher
concentration of free peptide (10- to 100-folds) was required to
inhibit the cellular uptake of OA02-NPs, whereas the equal
concentration of free peptide did not produce obvious inhibition effect. This could be possibly explained by the increased
binding afﬁnity of OA02 peptides presented on the nanoparticles surface due to the multivalency effects (35).
Intracellular tracking of dual ﬂuorescent-labeled
OA02-NPs in live cells
After 2-hour incubation, both FITC-labeled telodendrimer
carrier (green) and DiD dye payload (red) were simultaneously
internalized into the SKOV-3 cells with colocalized dot-shape
ﬂuorescent foci in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm (Fig.
4A, bottom left), indicating that the intact OA02-NPs were
taken up into the cytoplasm. These ﬂuorescent foci were
generated as a result of the accumulation of OA02-NPs in the
endocytic vesicles (i.e., endosomes and lysosomes). This was
evidenced by the partial colocalization of internalized FITClabeled OA02-NPs (green) with lysosomal compartment (red),
producing yellow ﬂuorescence in the merge images (Fig. 4A,
bottom right). Similar observation was also reported by Gu and
colleagues in the LNCaP prostate cancer cells incubated
with A10 aptamer–targeted PLGA-b-PEG-b-Apt nanoparticles
(34).
In vitro cytotoxicity study
PTX-OA02-NPs were found to be signiﬁcantly more cytotoxic against both SKOV-3 (Fig. 4B) and ES-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6), when compared with nontargeted PTX-NPs
at the equivalent paclitaxel concentration (P < 0.05). The

tumor–bearing mice. A, in vivo optical images of real-time tumor-targeting characteristics of nanoparticles or OA02-NPs. Tumor-bearing mice were injected

enhanced cytotoxicity of PTX-OA02-NPs is likely related to
the capability of OA02 peptide to facilitate the uptake of
PTX-OA02-NPs into ovarian cancer cells, thus increasing the
intracellular paclitaxel concentration. Furthermore, there
was no observable cytotoxic effect associated with both
blank nontargeted nanoparticles and OA02-NPs at the equivalent nanoparticles concentration, which eliminated the
possibility of OA02 peptides or nanoparticle-induced cytotoxic activity.
Biodistribution and tumor targeting speciﬁcity in vivo
NIRF optical imaging is an important tool for visualizing
molecular processes in vivo, as NIRF dyes with deep penetration, low autoﬂuorescence, and low tissue absorption and
scattering enable the high-resolution tissue imaging (26).
Both Cy5.5 ﬂuorescent-labeled nanoparticles and OA02-NPs

distributed throughout the body of the mice immediately
after the intravenous injection and gradually accumulated
into the SKOV3-luc tumor. However, the uptake rate of
OA02-NPs in the tumor site was faster than that of nontargeted nanoparticles. Substantial contrast between tumors
and background in the mice injected with OA02-NPs was
observed at around 4-hour postinjection, and these nanoparticles were able to be retained in the tumor throughout
the 24-hour period, whereas the accumulation of nontargeted nanoparticles in the tumor was not apparent until 8hour postinjection (Fig. 5A). Ex vivo images at 24 hours
showed that both nontargeted nanoparticles and OA02-NPs
exhibited relatively high uptake in the SKOV3-luc tumor
than in normal organs except the liver (macrophage uptake),
as the result of EPR effect (Fig. 5B). However, the mean
ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) of tumors for OA02-NPs was

Figure 6. In vivo tumor growth inhibition (A), Kaplan–Meier survival curves (B), and body weight changes (C) of SKOV-3 tumor–bearing mice after the
intravenous treatment of various paclitaxel formulations. Tumor-bearing mice were administered intravenously with PBS (control), Taxol (10 mg/kg), PTX-NPs
(10 and 30 mg/kg), and OA02-PTX-NPs (10 and 30 mg/kg), respectively, every 3 days on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 for a total of 6 doses. Data represent mean 

approximately 1.7-fold higher than that for nontargeted
nanoparticles (Fig. 5C, P < 0.05). The histologic distribution
of nanoparticles in the tumor tissue was further observed
under the confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5D, the
majority of Cy5.5-labeled nontargeted nanoparticles (red)
were mainly distributed in the perivascular region, which is
in concordance with previous histologic observations of
passive accumulation of liposomes and micelles in tumor
tissues (14). In contrast, OA02-NPs were able to extravasate
from the tumor vasculature, penetrate deep into the interstitial space of the tumor, bind to a-3 integrin–overexpressing tumor cells, and eventually become internalized. Similar
observations were also reported by Kirpotin and colleagues
using PEGylated liposome targeted by an anti-HER-2 antibody (36). The enhanced tumor localization and intracellular
uptake of OA02-targeted nanoparticles into ovarian cancer
cells is probably attributed to the speciﬁc interaction
between the OA02 peptide and a-3 integrin, thus facilitating
the homing of targeted nanoparticles to ovarian cancer, and
the receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Therapeutic study
The antitumor effect of PTX-OA02-NPs was evaluated in the
subcutaneous SKOV-3 ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model
when compared with nontargeted PTX-NPs and paclitaxel
clinical formation (Taxol). As shown in Fig. 6A, all the paclitaxel
formulations signiﬁcantly inhibited the tumor growth, when
compared with the control group (P < 0.05). However, both
PTX-NPs and PTX-OA02-NPs exhibited better tumor growth
inhibition than Taxol, at equivalent paclitaxel dose of 10
mg/kg. The superior tumor growth inhibition of paclitaxel
micellar formulations might be attributed to the larger amount
of paclitaxel delivered to the tumor site via the EPR effect. More
importantly, mice treated with PTX-OA02-NPs had signiﬁcantly slower tumor growth rate than those treated with nontargeted PTX-NPs at the equivalent paclitaxel doses (P < 0.05). The
survival rate of mice in each group is presented by the Kaplan–
Meier survival curve, respectively (Fig. 6B). In general,
compared with PBS control, all the paclitaxel formulations
signiﬁcantly prolonged the survival rates of tumor-bearing
mice. However, mice treated with 30 mg/kg PTX-OA02-NPs

A Novel Targeted Nanotherapeutics against Ovarian Cancer

exhibited the longest survival time among these treatment
groups. The median survival time of mice in the group of PBS
control, Taxol, PTX-NPs (10, 30 mg/kg), and PTX-OA02-NPs
(10, 30 mg/kg) were 20, 27, 29, 69, 32, and 95 days, respectively. It
was also noted that complete response (CR), deﬁned as a
complete disappearance of palpable tumor nodule, was
achieved in 5 of 10 mice (50%) in the 30 mg/kg PTX-OA02NPs group, and 2 of 8 mice (25%) in the 30 mg/kg PTX-NPs
group. The better tumor growth inhibition, prolonged survival
time, and higher complete tumor response rate observed in the
PTX-OA02-NPs group are likely due to the more efﬁcient and
speciﬁc delivery of paclitaxel to the ovarian cancer cells by the
unique ligand-targeted nanoformulation, as mentioned earlier.
Several independent investigations have also showed that
some other targeted nanoparticles such as antibody-targeted
liposomes (37), transferrin-targeted polymeric nanoparticles
(38), and folate-targeted polyamidoamine (PAMAM) polymers
(39) can signiﬁcantly enhance the antitumor effects as compared with their nontargeted counterparts.
Toxicities were assessed by direct observation of animal
behavior and body weight monitoring. Mice treated with 10
mg/kg Taxol showed a decline of overall activity during the ﬁrst
30-minute postinjection, which is likely a sign of hypersensitivity reaction related to the diluent (Cremophor EL and
ethanol; ref. 33). In addition, this group of mice was found to
have signiﬁcant amount of body weight loss (with a nadir of
6.7%) after receiving the ﬁrst few doses, when compared with
the control group (P < 0.05). In contrast, the mice in both PTXNPs and PTX-OA02-NPs groups tolerated the regimens well.
The treatments did not seem to have obvious adverse impact
on their activity level and body weight (Fig. 6C). Overall, the
paclitaxel nanoformulations, both PTX-NPs and PTX-OA02NPs, showed with an improved systemic toxicity proﬁle, which
might be attributed to their Cremophor-free composition,
prolonged blood retention time, and sustained drug release
features (40).

ﬁcity "OA02" peptide against a-3 integrin was successfully
conjugated to the distal PEG terminus of PEG5k-CA8 telodendrimer via "click chemistry" and displayed on the surface of
self-assembled micellar nanoparticles. OA02 peptide decoration dramatically enhanced the intracellular delivery of nanoparticle drugs into a-3 integrin–overexpressing ovarian cancer
cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, resulting in higher in
vitro cytotoxicity of PTX-OA02-NPs against those cancer cells
than nontargeted PTX-NPs. OA02 peptide also signiﬁcantly
facilitated the distribution of targeted nanoparticles into
tumor tissues and cells in SKOV3-luc tumor–bearing mice.
Furthermore, PTX-OA02-NPs were found to be more efﬁcacious and less toxic than the equivalent doses of nontargeted
PTX-NPs and Taxol in ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model.
Therefore, OA02 peptide–targeted nanoparticles drug delivery
system has great translational potential in the treatment of
patients with ovarian cancer.
