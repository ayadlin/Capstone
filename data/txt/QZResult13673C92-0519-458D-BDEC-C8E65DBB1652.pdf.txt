Abstract
We recently identified HSulf-1 as a down-regulated gene in
ovarian carcinomas. Our previous analysis indicated that
HSulf-1 inactivation in ovarian cancers is partly mediated by
loss of heterozygosity and epigenetic silencing. Here, we show
that variant hepatic nuclear factor 1 (vHNF1), encoded by
transcription factor 2 gene (TCF2, HNF1B), negatively regulates HSulf-1 expression in ovarian cancer. Immunoblot assay
revealed that vHNF1 is highly expressed in HSulf-1–deficient
OV207, SKOV3, and TOV-21G cell lines but not in HSulf-1–
expressing OSE, OV167, and OV202 cells. By short hairpin
RNA–mediated down-regulation of vHNF1 in TOV-21G cells
and transient enhanced vHNF1 expression in OV202 cells, we
showed that vHNF1 suppresses HSulf-1 expression in ovarian
cancer cell lines. Reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that vHNF1 is specifically
recruited to HSulf-1 promoter at two different vHNF1responsive elements in OV207 and TOV-21G cells. Additionally,
down-regulation of vHNF1 expression in OV207 and TOV-21G
cells increased cisplatin- or paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity
as determined by both 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and clonogenic assays and this
effect was reversed by down-regulation of HSulf-1. Moreover,
nude mice bearing TOV-21G cell xenografts with stably
down-regulated vHNF1 were more sensitive to cisplatin- or
paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity compared with xenografts of
TOV-21G clonal lines with nontargeted control short hairpin
RNA. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of 501 ovarian
tumors including 140 clear-cell tumors on tissue microarrays showed that vHNF1 inversely correlates to HSulf-1
expression. Collectively, these results indicate that vHNF1
acts as a repressor of HSulf-1 expression and might be a
molecular target for ovarian cancer therapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Our previous studies have shown that HSulf-1, an extracellular
sulfatase catalyzing the 6-O desulfation of heparan sulfate
glycosaminoglycans, is down-regulated in the majority (75%) of
tumor tissues harvested from ovarian cancer patients and is
undetectable in clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary, a particularly

aggressive and chemoresistant subtype (1). Loss of HSulf-1
expression augments both autocrine and paracrine proliferation
signaling through various epidermal growth factor–like growth
factor family ligands, such as epidermal growth factor, amphiregulin, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like growth
factor, resulting in an increase tumor cell growth and resistance
to drug-induced apoptosis (1, 2). In addition, reexpression
of HSulf-1 inhibits both tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis
in vivo (3).
Variant hepatic nuclear factor 1 (vHNF1; also called HNF1h or
TCF2) protein were initially identified based on its interaction with
a sequence essential for liver-specific transcription of several genes
postulated to determine the hepatic phenotype (4). Subsequent
studies have shown that there is a high level of vHNF1 expression
in pancreas, kidney, stomach, lung tissue, and hepatocellular
carcinoma (5). Mutations of the human vHNF1 gene are associated
with maturity onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5) and
renal carcinomas (6).
Despite the fact that it is highly curable if diagnosed early, cancer
of the ovaries causes more mortality in American women each year
than all other gynecologic malignancies combined (7). Clear-cell
ovarian cancer represents 2% to 15% of all epithelial ovarian
malignancies and has several clinical and histologic characteristics
distinguishing it from other types of ovarian cancers (8). For
instance, of all of the epithelial ovarian cancers, clear-cell
carcinoma has the worst prognosis partially because of its low
response to standard platinum-based chemotherapy (9–12). Several
investigations have indicated that vHNF1 is overexpressed in clearcell carcinoma and can be an excellent molecular marker of this
disease (13, 14). Other studies have shown that hypomethylation of
vHNF1 CpG island participates in the up-regulation of vHNF1 in
clear-cell carcinoma (15). Furthermore, down-regulation of vHNF1
expression by RNA interference induced apoptotic cell death in
ovarian clear-cell carcinoma cell lines (8). As indicated, our studies
of HSulf-1 expression have revealed that there is a much higher
frequency of loss of HSulf-1 expression in clear-cell tumors (100%)
of the ovary compared with serous histologic subtype (70%; ref. 1).
Therefore, we hypothesized that vHNF1 may negatively regulate
HSulf-1 expression in ovarian carcinomas.
In the present study, we report on the expression profile of
vHNF1 in ovarian cell lines and primary ovarian cancers by
immunoblot and tumor tissue microarray analysis. Additionally,
chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays
show that vHNF1 is specifically recruited to HSulf-1 promoter at
vHNF1-responsive elements (vHRE) in vivo and can markedly
reduce HSulf-1 promoter activity in vitro. Using lentiviral-mediated
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology, we also investigated the
effect of down-regulation of vHNF1 on HSulf-1 expression and
sensitivity to chemotherapy of ovarian cancer cells both in vitro
and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. TOV-21G, SKOV3, OVCAR3, and OVCAR5 cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. OV167, OV202, and
OSE cell lines were established as described previously (16, 17). A2780 cell
line was obtained on a MTA from Dr. Thomas Hamilton (Fox Chase Cancer
Center). All cell lines were grown as reported previously (16, 17).
Protein extracts and Western blot. Protein extraction and Western blot
analysis were done as described previously (2). The antibodies used for
immunoblotting were as follows: HSulf-1 (Abcam), vHNF1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and HNF1a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
shRNAs. The shRNAs used in this study are listed in the Supplementary
Experiment Procedures and Supplementary Table S1.
Plasmid constructions. The construction of all plasmids used in this
study is described in Supplementary Experiment Procedures. The sequences
of primers used for the amplification of constructs are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Luciferase reporter assays. Reporter assay was done as described
previously (18). See also Supplementary Experiment Procedures.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were done as described (16). See also Supplementary
Experiment Procedures.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) and clonogenic survival assays. Both assays were done as
described previously (17).
Attenuation of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity following small
interfering RNA–mediated down-regulation of HSulf-1 in vHNF1
down-regulated TOV-21G cells. Following confirmation of up-regulation
of HSulf-1 in vHNF1 down-regulated TOV-21G cells, up-regulated endogenous expression of HSulf-1 was down-regulated with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) targeting toward 3¶-untranslated region of HSulf-1 (Supplementary
Table S1) as described previously (16). Two days following HSulf-1 siRNA
transfection, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
cisplatin ranging from 2.5 to 30 Amol/L for 24 h in a 96-well plate and the
percentage of viable cells was determined by MTT assay.
Tumor xenograft experiments. All mice were handled according to the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mouse studies were
carried out following procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. Female athymic
nude mice (NCr-nu/nu; Animal Production Area, National Cancer InstituteFrederick Cancer Research and Development Center), ages 5 to 6 weeks,
were used for this study. For measurement of tumor growth in vivo, 3  106
TOV-21G transfectants stably expressing control shRNA or shvHNF1-1 and/
or shvHNF1-2 in 0.1 mL Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products) were
injected subcutaneously in the flanks of mice, generating two tumors per
mouse (a total of 12 mice for each stable clone). When TOV-21G tumors
were palpable, mice were treated intraperitoneally with cisplatin (4 mg/kg)
or paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) on days 1, 7, and 13 (n = 6). On day 14
(24 h following the last dose for both treatments), 1 mouse per group was
sacrificed and the tumor xenografts were monitored for vHNF1 and
HSulf-1 expression by immunoblot. The tumor volume was calculated twice
a week and by caliper measurements using the following formula: a  b 
c, where a is the length, b is the width, and c is the height (in millimeters).
The experiment was terminated 4 weeks following the beginning of
treatment.
Tumor tissue microarray. After approval by the institutional review
boards of Vancouver General Hospital and British Columbia Cancer Agency
and Mayo Clinic, archived ovarian epithelial tumor specimens from patients
with ovarian cancers obtained before chemotherapy were used in the
analysis. Tissue microarray construction and digital imaging system were as
described previously (14, 17). Characteristics of patients included in the
analysis are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The antibodies used for
these studies are for HSulf-1 (Abcam) and vHNF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The expression level of vHNF1 and HSulf-1 by immunohistochemistry
was scored and compared in triplicate specimens by three separate
observers in a double-blinded fashion. For both proteins, tumors showing
no staining (score 0) or weak focal staining (score 1) were considered to be

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

negative, whereas moderate (score 2) or intense staining (score 3) was
considered positive.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean F SD of at least three
independent experiments. Differences between groups were analyzed using
two-tailed Student’s t test. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the
strength of the association between the parameters. To correlate the levels
of vHNF1 and HSulf-1 with overall patient survival, Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis and log-rank test were done. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Expression analysis of HSulf-1 and vHNF1 in ovarian cancer
cell lines. HSulf-1 and vHNF1 expression were evaluated in seven
ovarian cancer cell lines and normal ovarian epithelial cells (OSE)
by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1A, OSE, OV167, and OV202 cells
express HSulf-1, whereas A2780, OV207, TOV-21G, SKOV3, and
OVCAR5 have undetectable or very low levels of HSulf-1
expression. However, vHNF1 is highly expressed in HSulf-1–
deficient OV207, SKOV3, and TOV-21G cell lines and weakly in
A2780 and OVCAR5 cells but not in HSulf-1–expressing OSE,
OV167, and OV202 cells.
Forced expression of vHNF1 in OV202 cells down-regulated
HSufl-1 expression. Lack of vHNF1 expression in HSulf-1–
expressing cell lines led us to speculate that vHNF1 could act as
a repressor of HSulf-1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we
transiently transfected vHNF1 expression construct into OV202
cells. Forty-eight hours following transfection, HSulf-1 expression
levels were determined by immunoblot and real-time quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1B, forced expression
of vHNF1 in OV202 cells reduced HSulf-1 expression at both
protein and mRNA levels.
shRNA-mediated down-regulation of vHNF1 up-regulated
HSulf-1 expression. To test if down-regulation of endogenous
vHNF1 may up-regulate HSulf-1 expression, vHNF1 was silenced
using lentiviral-mediated shRNAs in OV207 and TOV-21G cells as
described in Materials and Methods. The nontarget shRNAs served
as controls. As shown in Fig. 1C, our immunoblot analysis showed
that shRNAs targeting two different regions of vHNF1 open reading
frame markedly decreased the expression of vHNF1 compared with
the control shRNA in both cell lines. Attenuation of vHNF1
expression resulted in an increase of HSulf-1 protein expression,
which was more pronounced in TOV-21G cells compared with
OV207 cells. Down-regulation of vHNF1 also led to increased HSulf1 expression at mRNA level in both cell lines.
Overexpression of vHNF1 decreases HSulf-1 promoter
activity via vHREs. Based on the regulatory effect of HSulf-1
expression by vHNF1, we analyzed the databases TRANFAC and
Transcription Element Search System4 for consensus binding site
for vHNF1 transcription factor upstream of transcription initiation
site on HSulf-1 promoter. Sequence analysis of HSulf-1 promoter
using Transcription Element Search System revealed the presence
of three vHREs (5¶-ATTAAC-3¶) upstream of the transcription
initiation site. The diagrammatic representation of these elements
in HSulf-1 promoter is shown in Fig. 2A. The 1 kb promoter
sequence was cloned into a pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid.
Dual-luciferase assays were done on cell extracts from OV202 cells
cotransfected with luciferase reporter plasmid and either pvHNF1

Regulation of HSulf-1 by vHNF1

Figure 1. vHNF1 negatively regulates HSulf-1 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines. A, immunoblot analysis of HSulf-1 and vHNF1 expression in ovarian cell lines.
vHNF1 is highly expressed in HSulf-1–deficient OV207, SKOV3, and TOV-21G cell lines but not in HSulf-1–expressing OSE, OV167, and OV202 cells. B, enhanced
expression of vHNF1 down-regulates HSulf-1 expression in OV202 cells. OV202 cells were transfected with vHNF1 expression construct. Forty-eight hours later,
endogenous HSulf-1 protein and mRNA levels were determined by immunoblot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. C, shRNAs targeting
vHNF1 results in up-regulation of HSulf-1 expression at both protein and mRNA levels in OV207 and TOV-21G cells determined by immunoblot analysis and quantitative
real-time reverse transcription-PCR. shRNAs targeting two different regions of vHNF1 mRNA were used to generate stable transfectants (shvHNF1-1 and shvHNF1-2)
in OV207 and TOV-21G cell lines. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti–a-tubulin antibody to show equal loading of total protein. Results of real-time reverse

or pcDNA3.1 empty vector. As shown in Fig. 2B, overexpression of
vHNF1 significantly reduced HSulf-1 promoter activity compared
with controls. Figure 1B (left, lane 2) shows the level of HSulf-1 on
transient transfection of vHNF1 in OV202 cells.
To determine which of the three vHRE binding sites are required
for the inhibitory effect of vHNF1 on HSulf-1 promoter activity,
TT!GG ( for first and second vHRE sites) and TA!GC ( for third
vHRE in the opposite orientation) mutations that destroy the
vHNF1 binding were introduced into the vHNF1 binding sites,
respectively. Mutation of either vHRE2 or vHRE3 abolished
transcriptional repression of HSulf-1 by vHNF1. However, there
was no change in vHNF1 promoter activity when vHRE1 was
mutated (Fig. 2B). Mutations of both vHRE2 and vHRE3 in the
same construct also rescued HSulf-1 promoter activity, although

the effects were not additive. Collectively, these results indicate
that both vHRE2 (close to the transcriptional initiation site) and
vHRE3, distal to vHRE2, could be functionally relevant to regulate
HSulf-1 expression.
vHNF1 is specifically recruited to HSulf-1 promoter. To
determine whether vHNF1 is recruited to HSulf-1 promoter,
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were done in OV207 and
TOV-21G cells. For each cell line, DNA/protein complexes were
immunoprecipitated with anti-vHNF1 antibody and the purified
DNA was amplified with primers flanking vHRE1 and 3 sites in one
reaction and with primers (Supplementary Table S1) flanking
vHRE2 in another. The location of the three potential vHNF1
binding sites in HSulf-1 promoter and the primers used for
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay are shown in Fig. 2A. As

shown in Fig. 2C and D, vHNF1 is recruited to two different regions
within the HSulf-1 promoter in both TOV-21G and OV207 cells but
not in OV202 cells, which do not express vHNF1 (data not shown).
The first region spans vHRE1 and vHRE3, which are very close to
each other (Fig. 2A), whereas the second region contains vHRE2.
We confirmed that the recruitment was specific because there was
undetectable or very little amplification of IgG controls (Fig. 2C
and D, lanes 1 and 4).
Down-regulation of vHNF1 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to
cisplatin- or paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity. Our previous data
showed that HSulf-1 expression confers chemosensitivity to
multiple drugs in ovarian cancer (1). Therefore, we tested the effect
of down-regulation of vHNF1 on HSulf-1 expression and the
sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel. We downregulated vHNF1 expression in the two ovarian clear-cell-derived
cell lines, OV207 and TOV-21G, using lentiviral shRNAs against
vHNF1 and generated batch clones. vHNF1 down-regulation was
confirmed by Western blot as shown in Fig. 1C. Both vHNF1 downregulated batch clone and nontarget control cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of cisplatin or paclitaxel for 24 h and were
then incubated in fresh medium for additional 3 days. As shown in
Fig. 3A and B, shRNA mediated down-regulation of vHNF1 in both
OV207 and TOV-21G cells resulted in increased sensitivity to both
cisplatin and paclitaxel as determined by MTT reduction assay
compared with cells transduced with nontarget shRNA. To test
whether cisplatin- or paclitaxel-induced antiproliferative effects
translated into less clonogenic survival, we tested the clonogenic

survival of OV207 and TOV-21G batch clonal lines. Both control and
vHNF1 down-regulated batch clones were treated with various
concentrations of cisplatin or paclitaxel for 24 h, allowed to grow for
additional 10 days in drug-free medium, and then counted for
surviving colonies after Coomassie staining. Consistent with the
previous results, down-regulation of vHNF1 attenuated clonogenic
survival of cells transduced with shRNAs targeting vHNF1 compared
with the control cells (Fig. 3C and D). However, shRNAs targeting
vHNF1 have no effect on both HSulf-1 protein expression and
cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in vHNF1-deficient OV202 (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results suggest that down-regulation of
vHNF1 promotes chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in ovarian
cancer cells.
Specific contribution of HSulf-1 in conferring cisplatininduced cytotoxicity in TOV-21G cells following vHNF1 downregulation. Our results indicate that down-regulation of vHNF1 in
OV207 and TOV-21G cells results in the up-regulation of HSulf-1
expression. Additional studies indicate that, under these conditions, the cells become sensitive to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.
However, down-regulation of vHNF1 could result in changes of
several vHNF1 target gene expression (19). To determine the
specific contribution of HSulf-1 in cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity,
we transiently down-regulated HSulf-1 expression with siRNA in
TOV-21G cells with down-regulated vHNF1 expression. Downregulation of both vHNF1 and HSulf-1 was determined by
immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4, inset). As seen in Fig. 4, there is loss
of both vHNF1 and HSulf-1 expression in cells transfected with

vHNF1 binding sites in HSulf-1 promoter and the location

vHNF1 requires functional vHREs. OV202 cells were
cotransfected with either wild-type HSulf-1 luciferase
reporter construct or plasmids containing mutations in the
putative vHNF1 binding sites (slashed oval , white ones
indicate vHREs in the opposite orientation) as well as
pvHNF1 or pcDNA3.1 empty vector. The relative luciferase
activity is presented as a percentage of the luciferase
activity of the cells transfected with wild-type promoter
construct and pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Mean F SD of
triplicate samples. Results indicate that both vHRE2 and
vHRE3, but not vHRE1, could be functionally relevant to
regulate HSulf-1 expression. C and D, vHNF1 is recruited
to specific sites within HSulf-1 promoter. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay was done to show in vivo
binding of vHNF1 on HSulf-1 promoter. Anti-vHNF1
antibody or goat IgG was used to precipitate sonicated
chromatin from TOV-21G (C ) and OV207 (D ). Input control
DNA was diluted 5-fold before PCR amplification.

HSulf-1 siRNA (Fig. 4, inset, lane 3), whereas the scrambled siRNAtransduced controls express HSulf-1 but not vHNF1 (Fig. 4, inset,
lane 2). We used shvHNF1-2 batch clones in this experiment, as it
showed higher efficacy of vHNF1 knockdown than the other
transfectant shvHNF1-1 in TOV-21G cells (Fig. 1C). Two days
following HSulf-1 siRNA transfection, the cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of cisplatin for 24 h and the percentage
of viable cells was determined by MTT assay. Results in Fig. 4
indicate that there was an increase in cell survival following
HSulf-1 knockdown in vHNF1 down-regulated TOV-21G cells
compared with those with HSulf-1 expression. These results
suggest a specific contribution of HSulf-1 in cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity.

vHNF1 inhibition enhances the antiproliferative activity of
cisplatin or paclitaxel in vivo. Xenografts of TOV-21G transfectants stably expressing control shRNA or shvHNF1-1/2 were
generated and treated as described in Materials and Methods.
Measurements of tumors volume are graphically displayed in
Fig. 5A and B. Down-regulation of vHNF1 significantly increased
the in vivo sensitivity of TOV-21G cells to both drugs used in this
study, which is consistent with our in vitro experiments. Sustained
down-regulation of vHNF1 and HSulf-1 up-regulation in the
xenografts are confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 5C and D). This is
the first demonstration that vHNF1 gene silencing can induce
HSulf-1 expression and potentiate the antiproliferative effect of
cisplatin and/or paclitaxel in vivo.

Conversely, higher level of HSulf-1 was detected in 61.8% (246 of
398) of samples that were negative for vHNF1 staining. Thus, vHNF1
was inversely correlated with HSulf-1 expression level (P < 0.0001).
There was no relationship between vHNF1 and disease stage and
grade (P > 0.05). Additionally, serous tumors with moderate to high
levels of HSulf-1 (127 of 186, 68.3%) showed a trend toward
improved survival as assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and
log-rank test (P = 0.0465; Supplementary Fig. S2). However, we did
not observe this trend in either endometrioid or clear-cell tumors
potentially due to the limited numbers of HSulf-1–positive tumors
with these two subtypes (P > 0.05; data not shown).

Discussion

vHNF1 down-regulated TOV-21G cells. TOV-21G batch clonal cells stably
expressing shvHNF1-2 were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or varying
concentrations of cisplatin for 24 h and assayed by MTT reduction assay.
vHNF1 down-regulated clone ( ) was more sensitive to cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity compared with nontargeted shRNA control clone (n). Downregulation of vHNF1 (lane 2, top, inset ) leads to up-regulation of HSulf-1
(lane 2, middle, inset ). However, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of HSulf-1
expression in these cells (lane 3, middle, inset ) resulted in resistance to
cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity (E). The blots were stripped and reprobed with
anti–a-tubulin antibody to show equal loading of total protein (bottom, inset ).

vHNF1 inversely correlates to HSulf-1 expression in primary
ovarian cancers. To evaluate the potential association between
vHNF1 and HSulf-1 expression and clinicopathologic parameters in
ovarian cancer, a tissue microarray containing a total of 501 primary
ovarian tumor samples was analyzed (Fig. 6). vHNF1 immunostaining was predominantly found in the nucleus; 20.6% (103 of 501) of
ovarian tumors had positive staining of vHNF1, of which 63.1%
(65 of 103) of cases showed negative staining for HSulf-1.

We have previously shown that mRNA encoding HSulf-1 is downregulated in ovarian cancer (1). HSulf-1 down-regulation modulates
heparin-binding growth factor signaling and epigenetic modifications contribute in part to its down-regulation in human cancers
(16, 20, 21). We have also reported that HSulf-1 is a key regulator of
vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated proliferation and that
loss of HSulf-1 leads to increased tumorigenesis and angiogenesis
in vivo (3). In particular, patients with ovarian cancers expressing
higher levels of HSulf-1 showed a 94.4% response rate (17 of 18)
compared with a 58% (7 of 12) response rate among those with
weak or moderate levels of HSulf-1 expression (16). Accordingly,
HSulf-1 down-regulation appears to represent a mechanism by
which ovarian cancer cells enhance growth factor signaling and
diminish apoptosis.
Clear-cell ovarian cancers represents 2% to 15% of all epithelial
ovarian malignancies (22) and is associated with a poorer outcome
compared with serous carcinoma (12, 23). Several investigations
indicated that vHNF1 could be an excellent marker and a possible
molecular target for therapy for ovarian clear-cell carcinoma (8, 24,
25). Recent studies by Köbel and colleagues (14) showed that
vHNF1 showed the highest sensitivity (82.5%) and specificity

Regulation of HSulf-1 by vHNF1

Figure 6. Inverse correlation between vHNF1 and HSulf-1 expression in primary ovarian cancers. Immunohistochemistry analysis of representative tumors (two each
of clear-cell carcinomas: endometrioid and serous tumors) on the tissue microarray showing expression of vHNF1 (top ) and HSulf-1 (bottom ).

(95.2%) for clear-cell carcinoma. Based on our previous data
showing that HSulf-1 expression seems to be down-regulated or
lost in a much higher proportion of clear-cell tumors of the ovary
compared with other histologic subtypes (1), we surmised that
expression of HSulf-1 could be regulated by vHNF1. Consistent with
this hypothesis, sequence analysis showed the presence of three
vHREs upstream of the transcriptional start site of HSulf-1
promoter.
Immunoblot analysis of vHNF1 expression seemed to indicate
that loss of HSulf-1 could be associated with expression of vHNF1.
Of interest to this study is the observation that the HSulf-1–
expressing cell lines (OSE, OV167, and OV202) had complete loss of
vHNF1 expression, suggesting that vHNF1 could be a repressor of
HSufl-1 expression. Contrary to the report by other investigators (8,
13), we found that non–clear-cell-derived cell lines, such as SKOV3
cells, also expressed significant amounts of vHNF1 and also lower
levels of vHNF1 in OVCAR5 and A2780 cells in addition to robust
expression of vHNF1 in cell lines derived from clear-cell tumors,
OV207 and TOV-21G (Fig. 1A). However, Tomassetti and colleagues
(26) and Terasawa and colleagues (27) reported that other non–
clear-cell-derived cell lines such as IGROV1, SKOV3, and OVCAR3
cell lines express vHNF1.
Consistent with these observations, several findings from this
study indicate a regulatory role for vHNF1 in the control of HSulf-1
transcription. By shRNA-mediated down-regulation of vHNF1 in
TOV-21G cells and transient enhanced vHNF1 expression in OV202
cells, we showed that vHNF1 suppresses HSulf-1 expression in
ovarian cancer cell lines. We have also shown a decrease in HSulf-1
transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter assays following
overexpression of vHNF1 protein in OV202 cells and that it is
mediated through two different vHREs (vHRE2 and vHRE3) in
HSulf-1 promoter, which was further confirmed by chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays. However, we did not see a significantly more transcriptional activation of HSulf-1 on simultaneous
mutation of both sites, implicating that other cofactors could be
involved in regulating the activity of vHNF1 as observed for HNF1a, where a dimerization cofactor DcOH selectively stabilized HNF1a dimers and enhanced its transcriptional activity in a tissuespecific manner (28).
Other studies indicate that members of the HNF family, for
example, a closely related member of the family of HNF proteins,

www.aacrjournals.org

HNF1a, mediate transcriptional activation (29). HNF1a is a
homeodomain-containing protein that acts as a transcriptional
activator to regulate a large group of genes and associated with
development, metabolism, and cancer. The homeodomain and
dimerization domain, but not the activation domain, are highly
conserved between HNF1a and vHNF1 (HNF1h). Because vHNF1
lacks transcription activation domains, it is not surprising to note
that it has no or lower transactivation potency than that of HNF1a
(29). In addition, vHNF1 has been associated with repression of a
subset of hepatocyte-specific genes (30). It seems that HNF1a and
vHNF1 may regulate a different set of genes in vivo, although they
do not distinguish between the DNA-binding sites in vitro (29). We
also explored the potential regulatory role of HNF1a in HSulf-1
expression and found that overexpression of HNF1a could change
neither protein/mRNA level nor promoter activity of HSulf-1 in
ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that HNF1a does not bind to HSulf-1 promoter
region in vivo (data not shown). These results indicate that the
inhibitory effect of vHNF1 on HSulf-1 expression may be
independent of HNF1a.
Additional studies indicate that stable down-regulation of
vHNF1 sensitizes OV207 and TOV-21G cells to cisplatin- or
paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 3
and 5). As shown in Fig. 5, mouse bearing stably depleted vHNF1
TOV-21G xenografts were sensitive to both cisplatin and paclitaxel
treatment compared with vHNF1-proficient TOV-21G xenografts.
Consistent with this, we found elevated levels of HSulf-1 in the
tumor xenografts (Fig. 5C and D), lending additional support to our
previous finding that HSulf-1 is a critical determinant for increased
sensitivity toward both drugs in vivo (16). More importantly, downregulation of HSulf-1 in vHNF1 down-regulated clones restored
cisplatin resistance to a certain extent.
In the present study, we also determined the expression levels of
vHNF1 and HSulf-1 on 501 ovarian carcinomas on a tissue
microarray; 20.6% of ovarian tumors on this tissue microarray
showed high levels of vHNF1 staining and this was associated with
none to lower levels of HSulf-1 expression. Conversely, higher level
of HSulf-1 was detected in 61.8% of samples that had negative
vHNF1 staining. Moreover, 68.3% of patients with serous ovarian
cancer expressed HSulf-1 protein and showed a trend toward
improved survival.

Cancer Research

vHNF1 might directly or indirectly regulate unknown target
genes involved in survival and apoptosis. Our studies indicate that
one of these genes is HSulf-1, a putative tumor suppressor that is
lost in a substantial portion of ovarian tumors of both clear-cell
and non-clear-cell origin. Given the role that HSulf-1 plays in
conferring sensitivity to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents,
and the fact that it is lost in a higher proportion of ovarian tumors
of clear-cell origin, our data suggest that the chemoresistance of
clear-cell carcinoma could be associated with the overexpression of
vHNF1 acting as a repressor of HSulf-1. Therefore, targeting vHNF1
to up-regulate HSulf-1 could have therapeutic implications in clearcell carcinoma of ovary.
