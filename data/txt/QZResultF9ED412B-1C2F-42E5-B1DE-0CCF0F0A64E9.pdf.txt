Abstract
The MCT-1 oncogene was originally identified from lymphoma
cell lines. Herein we establish that MCT-1 is highly expressed in
85% of human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and
that knocking down MCT-1 by a specific short hairpin RNA in
DLBCL cells induces apoptosis, supporting a critical role for
MCT-1 in DLBCL cell survival. However, the mechanism
underlying MCT-1 regulation is largely unknown. We find that
MCT-1 is phosphorylated and up-regulated by extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Furthermore, by using a small
inhibitory molecule targeting ERK, we interrupted MCT-1
phosphorylation and stability. Significantly, cells with distinct
levels of MCT-1 protein displayed differential sensitivity to ERK
inhibitor–induced apoptosis. Treatment with the ERK inhibitor
showed marked in vivo antitumor activity in a human DLBCL
xenograft model. Our findings establish a functional molecular
interaction between MCT-1 and the MEK/ERK signaling
pathway and suggest that the activation of MCT-1 function by
its upstream kinase ERK plays an important role in lymphomagenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7835–43]

Introduction
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common
lymphoid malignancy in adults, accounting for f30,000 new cases
each year and nearly 40% of all non–Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL;
ref. 1). Despite recent advances in immunochemotherapy, longterm remission can only be achieved in f50% of patients (2).
Although some progress is being made, the fundamental abnormalities underlying DLBCL still remain elusive (2). Further research
is required to identify relevant molecular targets to develop
effective therapeutic approaches that will improve the clinical
outcome of patients with DLBCL.
We have discovered a novel oncogene in a T-cell lymphoma cell
line, multiple copies in T-cell lymphoma-1 (MCT-1), amplified in
human T-cell lymphoma and mapped to chromosome Xq22-24 (3).
The MCT-1 gene has an open reading frame that encodes a protein
of 181 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 20 kDa (3).
Constitutive expression of MCT-1 results in a strong proliferative
signal and is associated with deregulation of the G1-S phase
checkpoint (3). There is increasing evidence supporting a role for

the MCT-1 oncogene in lymphomagenesis, including its ability to
stimulate cell proliferation, suppress apoptosis, and promote
angiogenesis (3–6). Importantly, MCT-1 has been shown to transform
both human and murine immortalized cells (5, 6). The exact
molecular mechanism(s) by which MCT-1 transforms cells is still
evolving; however, there are data implicating MCT-1 in modulating
the translation of cancer-related genes through its interaction with
the cap complex (7, 8). MCT-1 protein forms a complex with
DENR/DRP, a protein containing an SUI1 domain involved in
recognition of the translation initiation codon (7). Recently, several
lines of evidence indicate that abnormal control of translation
contributes to lymphomagenesis (9–11). The deregulated function
of those translational molecules associated with lymphomagenesis
presents unique opportunities to target proteins critical to the
malignant phenotype. Therefore, it may be beneficial to selectively
block MCT-1 function and to diminish its involvement in abnormal
cell functions such as cancer cell proliferation and transformation.
Currently, there are no available specific small inhibitory
molecules that can directly modulate MCT-1 protein function.
Phosphorylation of MCT-1 protein by extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is essential for protein stabilization and for its
ability to promote cell proliferation (12). These data indicated that
MCT-1 levels and function are dependent on the ERK signaling
pathway. Therefore, targeting molecules upstream of MCT-1 could
affect the stability and activity of MCT-1. Importantly, several
reports linked unregulated activation of ERK proteins to cancer cell
apoptosis, proliferation, and malignant transformation (13–15).
Disruption of ERK1/2 activation by MEK1/2 inhibitors results in a
dramatic increase in apoptosis of hematopoietic malignant cells
(16, 17). Therefore, it seemed reasonable to attempt disruption of
MCT-1 function by inhibiting its upstream kinase, ERK. Taking
advantage of recently identified ERK docking domains and using
computer-aided drug design, a novel small-molecule ERK inhibitor
designated no. 76 has been identified (18). It binds to ERK2 with a
K D of f5 Amol/L and prevents its interaction with protein
substrates. Targeting this inhibitor to individual ERK docking
domains can potentially be used to disrupt ERK2 interactions with
specific protein substrates (18).
Here, we report that MCT-1 is highly expressed in 85% of human
DLBCLs, supporting the feasibility of therapeutic targeting of
MCT-1 for DLBCL. Moreover, our data establish the functional
interaction between MCT-1 and the MEK/ERK signaling pathway
and the potential role of targeting MCT-1 and its upstream kinases
in the therapy of DLBCL.

NOTE: The vast majority of DLBCL showed strong staining with a
highly significant P value (1.9  10 15) derived using the statistical m2
test. Percent positive is determined by number of strong staining
samples over the total number of samples.

(Jurkat) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum. Farage-Vector (F-Vector) and Farage-overexpressing MCT-1
(F-MCT-1) cells were described previously (7). Normal donor peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated and cultured as described (4). MEK
inhibitors PD98059 (40 Amol/L), U0126 (10 Amol/L), and ERK inhibitor
no. 76 [3-(2-aminoethyl)-5-((4-ethoxyphenyl) methylene)-2,4-thiazolidinedione, HCl] were from Calbiochem. Wild-type MEK2 (WT MEK2) and
constitutively active MEK2 (CA MEK2) constructs have been previously
described (19). Specific oligo small interfering RNAs (siRNA) for MEK2,
ERK1, ERK2, and the negative siRNA control were obtained from Qiagen.
Transfection experiments were done using Amaxa Nucleofector kit V
(Amaxa) as previously described (7).
MCT-1 knockdown in SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 cell lines. Mission-TRC
short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–encoding lentiviruses targeting human MCT-1
(Sigma-Aldrich) were used for transduction in SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 cell lines
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. These shRNA-encoding lentiviruses
targeting human MCT-1 contained four individual clones: NM_014060.1499s1c1 (defined as no. 1), NM_014060.1-374s1c1 (defined as no. 2),
NM_014060.1-542s1c1 (defined as no. 3), and NM_014060.1-638s1c1 (defined
as no. 4). We also used a control shRNA lentivirus (SHC-002V) encoding a
shRNA targeted against no known mouse or human gene. For transient
knockdown experiments, SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 cells were transduced, and
72 h after transduction, harvested and assayed for apoptosis. For stable
knockdown experiments, SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 cells were transduced, and
72 h after transduction, cells were selected in a puromycin-containing
medium (0.5 Ag/mL) for 14 d and then expanded for further experimentation.
Cell apoptosis assays. SUDHL4, SUDHL6, and Farage cells (2  105/mL)
were seeded at equal density and then treated with ERK inhibitor no. 76 in
complete RPMI 1640 medium. Forty-eight hours after ERK inhibitor treatment,
cells were harvested and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using
Annexin V staining kit (Southern Biotech). The significance of differences
between experimental conditions was determined using the Student’s t test.
Soft agar colony-forming assay. SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 cells transient
expressing either control shRNA or shMCT-1 were assessed in vitro for their

ability to form colonies in soft agar as previously described (8). The
number of colonies in each well was counted. Colony formation (>50 cells)
was examined under phase-contrast microscopy. Images were taken at
room temperature using a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000S microscope. Each
experiment was conducted several times and the significance of differences
between experimental conditions was determined using the Student’s
t test.
Immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and glutathione S-transferase
fusion protein pull-down assay. After treatment with ERK inhibitor, cell
lysates were prepared using standard methodology (20). Antibodies were
added to lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4jC. Antibodies were collected
with protein A or protein G–Sepharose beads, and protein complexes
were washed three times at 4jC with the lysis buffer. Western blotting
was performed as previously described (20). Anti–pElk-1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) and anti–phospho-threonine
antibody (Chemicon) were used at 1:1,000, whereas anti–MCT-1 (7) and
anti-actin (C2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:5,000. Glutathione
S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed and purified as
previously described (21). The immobilized GST fusion proteins were
incubated with lysates of Jurkat cells for 1 h at 4jC. The beads were washed
with lysis buffer four times and then protein complexes were separated by
SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting.
Tissue microarray construction and immunohistologic analysis.
MCT-1 protein expression was interrogated on tissue microarrays of 406
human NHLs with appropriate control tissues. The lymphomas were
classified according to the current WHO classification scheme (22). The
selection of lymphoma samples, tissue microarray construction, and
immunohistologic staining were described previously (23). Anti–MCT-1
antibody was used at a dilution of 1:800. Detection was carried out using the
DakoCytomation EnVision+ System-HRP labeled polymer (DakoCytomation, Inc.). Staining was optimized on normal paraffin-embedded tonsil
sections, and a cutoff of staining in >30% of lymphoma cells was assigned a
positive score. This cutoff was based on the need for using a nonambiguous
threshold for scoring tissue microarrays (TMA) and does not reflect
differences in staining intensity between normal and neoplastic tissue or
among different diagnoses. Institutional review board approval from
Stanford University was obtained for these studies.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The paraffin
sections were stained with a Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. As described previously (24), the
paraffin section slides were incubated overnight at 4jC with rabbit antihuman MCT-1 antibody (1:1,000). Slides were then treated with biotinylated
anti-rabbit IgG and incubated with performed avidin-peroxidase complex.
The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and
mounted. Negative controls were included. Immunohistochemical staining
was evaluated by the hematopathologist (X.F.Z.). The images were acquired
with a Nikon eclipse 50i microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc.) and
formatted with an Adobe PhotoShop CS software. Human sample studies
have been approved by the University of Maryland Medical School
Institutional Review Board and conform to the Declaration of Helsinki.
For fluorescence double staining, the section was treated as above
and first stained with mouse monoclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:200).
After biotin blocking, the section was then stained with rabbit polyclonal
anti–MCT-1 antibody (1:1,000). The sections were then washed with PBS
and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse
Alexa Fluor 568 at a concentration of 1:200 each. The stained sections were
mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs). Control
sections were similarly processed, except that the primary antisera were
omitted, which yielded no staining. Images were captured using an Olympus
FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) and processed with the Olympus
Fluoview Version 1.7c software.
In vivo tumor growth in the xenograft models. Female severe
combined immunodeficient mice (SCID) Beige mice were housed in a
pathogen-free environment under controlled conditions of light and
humidity and received food and water ad libitum. SUDHL6 or Daudi cells
(2  106) were resuspended in 100 AL PBS and then mixed with an equal

dorsal flanks of 5- to 7-wk-old female SCID mice. When the tumor reached
the size of f60 to 163 mm3, the drug was administered i.p. every other day
at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight for a total of 20 d. Injection
of the vehicle alone (5% DMSO in 0.05 mol/L PBS) was used as a control.
Tumor volumes were calculated as previously performed (6). Tumors were
harvested for further analysis. The significance of differences between
treatment arms was determined using the Student’s t test.

Results
MCT-1 was highly expressed in 85% of human DLBCLs. We
have previously identified high levels of MCT-1 protein in a limited
analysis of primary B-cell NHL (4). Here, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of MCT-1 protein in 406 primary lymphoma
tissue specimens using tissue microarray analysis (TMA; ref. 23).
The tissue microarray included 370 B-cell lymphoma and 36
T-cell lymphoma samples. The representative views of immunohistologic scoring used in the TMA analysis are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1. As summarized in Table 1, MCT-1 is

strongly expressed in 85% of 113 DLBCL samples. In 88 low-grade
follicular lymphoma (FL) samples, MCT-1 staining was strongly
expressed in only 6% of cases. Interestingly, 20% of high-grade
(grade 3) FL showed strong positive staining for MCT-1. These data
indicated that MCT-1 expression is significantly increased in
DLBCL samples compared with that in low-grade FL and other
NHLs, suggesting a role for MCT-1 in DLBCL development and/or
progression. Importantly, either the germinal center or non–
germinal center subtypes of DLBCL did not influence the high rate
of MCT-1 positivity (data not shown). Although strong positive
staining for MCT-1 is identified in 82% of 11 mediastinal large Bcell lymphoma and 68% of 25 peripheral T-cell lymphoma samples,
respectively, the total number of those specimens examined is
small and awaits larger confirmatory studies. Figure 1A (top) shows
representative immunohistochemistry images of MCT-1 protein
expression in a reactive lymph node and DLBCL. MCT-1 staining
was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm of DLBCL lymphoma
cells and, to a much lesser extent, in the normal B-cells of reactive
lymph nodes and normal tonsils. These data establish that MCT-1

protein levels are highly elevated in the vast majority of DLBCL,
supporting its value as a potential therapeutic target.
Knocking down MCT-1 by shRNA induced DLBCL cell
apoptosis and reduced their clonogenic capacity. We hypothesized that disruption of MCT-1 function would result in a
diminished malignant phenotype in DLBCL cells overexpressing
MCT-1. To test this hypothesis, we used a knockdown approach to
inhibit MCT-1 function. SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 cells were
transiently transduced with a lentivirally encoded MCT-1 shRNA
(hairpin no. 3; shMCT-1) and MCT-1 expression was monitored by
immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1B and C, when MCT-1 protein
was down-regulated in SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 by shRNA, 47% of
SUDHL4 and 52% of SUDHL6 cells underwent apoptosis 72 hours
after transduction compared with 5% to 10% apoptosis seen in cells
transduced with control shRNA. These data were confirmed by a
second lentivirally encoded MCT-1 shRNA (hairpin no. 1), as shown
in Supplementary Fig. S2. We next examined whether interfering

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

with MCT-1 function by shRNA would inhibit SUDHL4 and
SUDHL6 tumorigenicity using soft-agar colony formation. In
Fig. 1D, we showed a statistically significant decrease in the
colony formation of SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 cells when MCT-1 was
knocked down. These results indicated that inhibition of MCT-1
function induced apoptosis and reduced the clonogenic capacity of
the DLBCL cell lines.
MCT-1 is a direct substrate of ERK in DLBCL cells. Because a
specific small molecule that selectively targets MCT-1 is currently
not available, we sought to target the kinase directly upstream of
MCT-1. This prompted us to examine ERK1/2 expression in
DLBCL. We have analyzed ERK1/2 and MCT-1 protein levels on 12
cases of human primary DLBCL and 5 cases of human reactive
lymph node by immunohistochemical staining. ERK1/2 staining
was considerably stronger in DLBCL than in reactive B cells
(Fig. 1A, bottom; Supplementary Fig. S3), in parallel with the
pattern observed for MCT-1 in DLBCL. Pearson correlation analysis

revealed that the expression level of ERK protein is strongly
correlated with MCT-1 protein level in human DLBCL samples
surveyed (correlation coefficient r = 0.77, P < 0.01). The correlation
was also confirmed by Western blot analysis in human lymphoma

MCT-1, or ERK in the total cell lysates were monitored by immunoblotting
with the indicated antibodies. The effects of inhibitors on MCT-1 threonine

antibody was used in immunoprecipitation instead of MCT-1 antibody for

cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A, MCT-1 expression was low in Farage
and PBL cells, as was ERK expression. In those cell lines (Daudi,
Jurkat, and SUDHL6) with high MCT-1 expression, we found
similarly elevated ERK protein levels. We next examined whether
MCT-1 physically associates with ERK. As shown in the left panel of
Fig. 2B, we were able to detect the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous MCT-1 with ERK in Jurkat and Farage–MCT-1
cells. To further confirm this interaction, in vitro GST fusion
protein pull-down assays were performed. In the right panel of
Fig. 2B, we showed that the GST fusion protein containing
MCT-1 was able to pull down ERK. To better understand the
relationship between MCT-1 and ERK in vivo, we conducted
double-immunofluorescence analysis of MCT-1 and ERK in human
lymph node tissues to detect their colocalization. In reactive lymph
nodes, both MCT-1 and ERK have weak staining and we observed
weak overlapping MCT-1 and ERK expression (Supplementary
Fig. S4). In DLBCL, both MCT-1 and ERK had much stronger
staining and their colocalization was much more prominent in the
cytoplasm of DLBCL cells (Fig. 2C).
Subsequently, we tested whether MCT-1 is an in vivo substrate
of ERK. Because MEK1/2 has no known substrates besides the
ERK kinase, we reasoned that selective MEK overexpression or
inhibition might clarify how the mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway regulates MCT-1. Figure 2D (top) shows that MCT-1
expression was increased by overexpression of active MEK2 in
Farage and Raji cells, respectively. Due to the technical difficulty in
transfecting oligos into SUDHL4 and SUDHL6 cells using liposomal
or electroporation methods, specific oligo siRNA for MEK2 or ERK
were transfected into Jurkat and Daudi cells through electroporation. Reciprocally, knocking down MEK2 by siRNA in Jurkat
cells also decreased MCT-1 expression. Furthermore, knocking
down ERK1 or ERK2 expression in Jurkat and Daudi cells resulted
in a decreased expression of MCT-1 (Fig. 2D, bottom). These data
unequivocally linked MCT-1 protein levels with ERK signaling.
ERK inhibitor decreased MCT-1 protein level and phosphorylation and disrupted the association between MCT-1
and ERK. Because MCT-1 is a direct substrate of ERK, we
envisioned disrupting MCT-1 function through ERK inhibition.
Therefore, we examined whether ERK inhibitor affected MCT-1
protein levels and threonine phosphorylation. Figure 3A showed
the reduction of MCT-1 and pThr-MCT-1 after small-molecule ERK
inhibitor (no. 76) treatment in SUDHL6 and Farage–MCT-1 cells.
Elk-1 is a previously characterized substrate of ERK and served as a
positive control (25). It has previously been reported that no. 76 can
block the interaction between ERK and substrate proteins by
binding to ERK docking domains (18). We next determined
whether the ERK inhibitor disrupted the association between
MCT-1 and ERK. As shown in Fig. 3B and C, the association
between MCT-1 and ERK in SUDHL6 and Farage–MCT-1 cells was
decreased in the presence of no. 76 but not in the presence of the
MEK inhibitor PD98059. In addition, no. 76 had minimal effect on
ERK1/2 protein levels. Another MEK inhibitor, U0126, had a similar
effect as PD98059 (data not shown), suggesting that ERK
interactions with MCT-1 are independent of ERK phosphorylation.
Increased MCT-1 protein levels sensitized DLBCL cells
to ERK inhibitor–induced apoptosis. To examine the impact
of MCT-1 protein levels on the sensitivity of DLBCL cells to ERK
inhibitor therapy, we examined the effect of the ERK inhibitor
in DLBCL cell lines with different levels of MCT-1. To address this,
we established an experimental model using several stable cell
lines that were genetically modified to either overexpress or

MCT-1, and Farage-Vector cells as previously described (7) were
incubated with different doses of no. 76 for 48 hours. Figure 4A
showed that ERK inhibitor modestly induced, in a dose-dependent
manner, apoptosis in Farage-Vector cells; in contrast, Farage–MCT1 cells were significantly more sensitive to ERK inhibitor–induced
apoptosis. These data implied that MCT-1 may be a functionally
relevant target of ERK and that inhibition of ERK activity would
selectively induce apoptosis of DLBCL cells with elevated MCT-1
levels. To explore this further, we stably transduced SUDHL4 and
SUDHL6 cells with a panel of lentivirally encoded MCT-1 shRNAs

hairpin no. 3 was the most efficient in knocking down MCT-1
expression. Stably transduced cells that were viable after knocking
down MCT-1 protein were selected for further analysis. The ERK
inhibitor dramatically induced apoptosis in SUDHL6 control

levels of MCT-1 supported our contention that MCT-1 is relevant
to the phenotype observed after exposing DLBCL cells to the
ERK inhibitor.
In vivo antitumor efficacy of the ERK inhibitor.
We subsequently examined whether no. 76 inhibits lymphoma
growth in SCID mice. As shown in Fig. 5A, 10 mg/kg of no. 76
inhibited tumor growth in both Daudi and SUDHL6 xenograft
models. At this dose, no lethal toxicity or significant weight loss was
observed among treated animals. To confirm that the growth
inhibition effect was correlated with MCT-1, we performed both
immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry on xenografts. Figure
5B showed that no. 76 dramatically decreased MCT-1 protein levels
but had minimal effect on ERK and p-ERK protein levels in Daudi
and SUDHL6 xenografts. Similar data were obtained through
examining MCT-1 protein levels by immunohistochemistry assays
in xenografts (Fig. 5C). These data showed that the ERK inhibitor
effectively inhibits lymphoma growth in vivo by interfering with
ERK signaling and subsequently reducing MCT-1 levels and
function.

Discussion
DLBCL is the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults,
accounting for f30,000 new cases each year (1). In addition to
de novo DLBCL, 25% to 60% of FL, a low-grade NHL, will transform
to an aggressive DLBCL (1, 26, 27). Defining the critical pathways
that underlie the pathogenesis of DLBCL is an important step
toward targeted therapy with the potential for greater efficacy and
less toxicity. Using a high-throughput approach, we were able to
show significantly elevated levels of a potential target, the MCT-1
oncogene in the vast majority (85%) of DLBCLs. In contrast, we did

not observe significant levels of MCT-1 protein in most of the
indolent lymphoid malignancies examined, including FL and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Disruption of MCT-1 function in DLBCL is hypothesized to
result in an attenuated malignant phenotype. In this study,
knocking down MCT-1 using shRNA in several DLBCL cell lines
dramatically induced cell apoptosis. This provided the first
direct genetic evidence that specific disruption of MCT-1 was
capable of killing lymphoma cells with high endogenous levels of
MCT-1. Previously, using a dominant-negative approach, we
showed that a MCT-1 deletion mutant resulted in an altered
translational profile and decreased anchorage-independent colony
formation (8). We reasoned that in MCT-1 highly expressing
DLBCLs, lymphoma cells might be more dependent on MCT-1
compared with low-level expressing cells. This phenomenon,
‘‘oncogene addiction,’’ first described by Weinstein, postulates
that cancer cell growth and survival can often be impaired by
the inactivation of a single oncogene and provides a rationale for
molecular targeted therapy (28).
Because a specific and effective small-molecule inhibitor that
selectively targets MCT-1 is currently not available, we sought to
target the kinase directly upstream of MCT-1. We found that MCT-1
colocalized with ERK and that ERK was also readily detectable in
human DLBCL, which is consistent with other reports that the
ERK1/2 pathway is constitutively expressed/activated in some NHL
cell lines (29). Furthermore, we have shown that knocking down
ERK1/2 expression using a specific siRNA decreased MCT-1 protein
levels. Conversely, an increase in ERK phosphorylation resulted in a
marked elevation of MCT-1 protein. Combined with our previous
data that MCT-1 was phosphorylated by ERK directly in vitro (12),
we have established that MCT-1 is a direct substrate of ERK in vivo.
Consequently, targeting the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is likely

to be a useful therapeutic approach in DLBCL that exhibit high
levels of MCT-1 protein. By using a novel small-molecule ERK
inhibitor, we were able to show that the ERK inhibitor dramatically
induced apoptosis of DLBCL cells and that elevated MCT-1 protein
levels differentially sensitized DLBCL cells to inhibiting ERK.
Significantly, treatment with the ERK inhibitor had marked
antitumor activity in a human lymphoma xenograft established
from DLBCL cell lines with elevated MCT-1 protein levels. These
data suggested that MCT-1 is indeed a relevant target of ERK
inhibition. In addition to the interruption of MCT-1 function, it is
likely that ERK inhibition also regulates other proteins in DLBCL
because ERK is known to phosphorylate a number of targets,
including p90Rsk-1, c-Myc, and Elk-1 (30). Nevertheless, our above
data, derived from syngeneic cells with distinct levels of MCT-1
protein displaying differential sensitivity to ERK inhibition, strongly
supports our contention that MCT-1 is relevant to the phenotype
observed after exposing DLBCL cells to the ERK inhibitor. The
observation that knocking down MCT-1 induces apoptosis in
lymphoma cells and recently published work demonstrating that a
dominant-negative MCT-1 protein also affects the survival of
lymphoma cells support the biological importance of interfering
with MCT-1 function (8). It is therefore reasonable to consider
MCT-1 an important target of ERK and that its functional
disruption contributes at least in part to the phenotype observed
by ERK inhibition.
The mechanism by which the ERK inhibitor no. 76 modifies
MCT-1 activity is still unclear. One possible scenario is that the
ERK inhibitor binds to the docking domain of ERK, which blocks
the binding of MCT-1 to ERK. This is consistent with our findings
that ERK inhibitor disrupted the association between MCT-1 and
ERK. Here, we show that the ERK inhibitor decreased MCT-1
protein levels and phosphorylation. Thus, physical interaction
between MCT-1 and ERK contributes to MCT-1 protein stability
and biological activity. We also showed that knockdown of MEK2
by siRNA reduced MCT-1 protein levels. The MEK inhibitors
(PD98059 and U0126) showed similar results as no. 76 but were
somewhat less effective, suggesting that inhibition of ERK is
more effective in disrupting MCT-1 function compared with

inhibition of MEK. Our data also imply that ERK and MCT-1 can
interact regardless of whether ERK is active or not. However,
phosphorylation also contributes to protein stability of MCT-1 (12).
Thus, MEK inhibitors only interfere with the phosphorylation of
MCT-1, whereas ERK docking domain inhibitors reduce both
protein interaction and subsequent phosphorylation. An important
finding in this study was that no significant toxicity or weight loss
was observed among treated animals at the dose of 10 mg/kg. This
lack of apparent toxicity makes targeting specific ERK substrates
an attractive clinical approach.
In summary, our findings reveal a functional linkage between
MEK/ERK signaling and the oncogenic activity of MCT-1. We
identified in a large-scale screen of NHL elevated levels of the MCT1 protein in 85% of DLBCL. We showed for the first time that
specifically knocking down MCT-1 was able to induce apoptosis in
a number of DLBCL cell lines as well as suppress colony formation.
Furthermore, we established that MCT-1 is a substrate of ERK and
that ERK modulated both its protein levels and activity. By using
a highly specific small molecule interfering with ERK function,
we were able to show a significant degree of antitumor activity in
an in vivo human lymphoma xenograft model established from
DLBCL cell lines with elevated MCT-1 protein levels. Together,
these data provide a rationale for the therapeutic use of ERK
inhibitors in MCT-1–overexpressing lymphoma and support the
development of novel small inhibitory molecules directed toward
MCT-1 as a promising approach in DLBCL.
