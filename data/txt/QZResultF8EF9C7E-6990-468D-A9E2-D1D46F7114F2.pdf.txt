BACKGROUND. Gefitinib, an orally active inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, combined with chemotherapy, has shown efficacy
as second-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Gefitinib combined with FOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin plus folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil) was tested
as a first-line therapy.

METHODS. Patients with metastatic EGFR-positive CRC received gefitinib at a
dose of 250 mg/day combined with simplified FOLFOX6. Gefitinib was continued
as maintenance treatment in nonprogressing patients. Responses were assessed
by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and adverse
events were assessed with the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) scale.

lthough the combination oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and leucovorinmodulated 5-fluorouracil has improved outcomes for patients
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), objective responses are obtained
in only 40% to 50% of patients, and the median survival is 14 to 18
months. The identification of molecular targets implicated in cancer
cell proliferation, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), has opened up the possibility of improving outcomes for metastatic CRC, particularly when combined with chemotherapy.

Gefitinib and FOLFOX6 in Colorectal CA/Zampino et al.

Two clinical approaches have been used to target
the EGFR signaling pathway: monoclonal antibodies
against the extracellular domain of the receptor that
prevent ligand binding, and small molecule inhibitors
of the adenosine triphosphate binding that inhibit
tyrosine kinase and hence receptor autophosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation makes docking sites on
the EGFR available for proteins that link the receptor
to a cascade of downstream biochemical reactions
such as the ras-raf-MAPK-fos pathway, which stimulates cell growth.1 EGFR is overexpressed in several
cancers, including up to 80% of CRCs; EGFR overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and
poor prognosis.2
Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del) is an orally active, low molecular weight competitive inhibitor of tyrosine kinase
domain on EGFR. Its key preclinical features include
good tolerability and the ability, at nanomolar concentrations, to delay growth and cause regression in a
wide range of tumor xenografts.3 Interestingly,
although gefitinib has demonstrated dose-dependent
antitumor activity, the level of EGFR expression does
not appear to predict tumor response.3
EGFR expression may be up-regulated by chemotherapeutic agents through the induction of apoptosis and coadministration of gefitinib with a
variety of cytotoxic drugs has been markedly shown
to enhance their efficacy by mechanisms unrelated
to levels of EGFR expression.4 In particular, gefitinib
has induced supra-additive growth inhibition and
has enhanced apoptotic cell death when combined
with several agents, including oxaliplatin and 5fluorouracil.5
During phase 1 trials, gefitinib was responsible for
a number of cases of prolonged disease stabilization
in colorectal cancer patients at a maximum tolerated
dose of 600 mg/day. However, 225 mg/day was found
to be sufficient to produce minimum biologic
effects.6–8
In a recent phase 2 study conducted in patients
with pretreated CRC who were not selected for EGFR
status, a combination of gefitinib plus FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil) resulted in
33% partial remissions and a median survival of 12
months, with relatively manageable toxicity; these
results appeared to be better than those reported by
chemotherapy alone in a similar population.9
The present multicenter phase 2 trial was conducted on patients with metastatic CRC who had not
received treatment for their metastatic disease. The
aim was to assess the efficacy of gefitinib combined
with a simplified FOLFOX6 regimen, followed by gefitinib maintenance monotherapy in cases that did not

progress. We included only patients whose cancers
overexpressed EGFR. Most previous studies were conducted in patients with EGFR-positive cancers or in
unselected populations and to our knowledge few
data are available on the effects of gefitinib on EGFRnegative cancers. We believe gefitinib should have
more effect on EGFR-positive cancers.2

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
This was a multicenter, open-label, noncomparative,
phase 2 trial in patients with newly diagnosed or
recurrent metastatic CRC who had received no prior
systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease and
had at least 20% (score 11) cancer cells positive for
EGFR. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed
adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum with radiographic evidence of synchronous or metachronous
metastatic disease. Material from least 1 metastatic
site was examined histologically and EGFR expression determined. All specimens were reviewed by a
single laboratory.
Other inclusion criteria included the ability to
take and retain oral medication, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
0 to 2, age 18 years, measurable disease by Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), absolute
neutrophil count 1.5 3 109/L, platelet count 100
3 109/L, serum creatinine 1.5 times upper normal
limit (UNL), total bilirubin 1.5 3 UNL, and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) 2.5 3 UNL (or 5 3 UNL if liver metastases
was present), and a life expectancy [3 months. All
patients signed an informed consent form approved
by local ethical committees.
EGFR Determinations
Four ultrathin paraffin-embedded slides per specimen
(primary or metastatic cancer) were incubated for 1
hour at room temperature with 50 lL/mL of commercially available (clone 31G7; DBA, Milan, Italy) mouse
monoclonal antibody against the peptide backbone of
the extracellular domain of EGFR. This was followed
by incubation with detection kit (Dako EnVision PlusHRP; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The slides were assessed for
EGFR by a single observer (G.P.) experienced in tumor
pathology and unaware of patient identity. The intensity (weak, moderate, and strong) and pattern (incomplete or complete) of membrane staining and the
percentage of positive cells (scanning at least 1000
cells in representative fields) were recorded. Only cells
with membrane labeling were considered. A 4-point

ment was delayed [3 weeks, the patient was withdrawn from the study. If toxicity recovered to
grade \2 from grade 3 or grade 4, chemotherapy continued with a 25% or 50% dose reduction, respectively.
For laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia the next oxaliplatin
dose was administered as a 6-hour infusion. If grade 3
and 4 allergy occurred the patient was withdrawn.

score (0–3) that combined staining intensity and staining pattern was assigned to each specimen, using the
Dako system formerly used for the HerceptTest. At
least 20% of cells (score 1) had to be positive.
Serum EGFR (extracellular binding domain) levels
were determined at baseline and at each patient
assessment by quantitative enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay using a monoclonal capture antibody (Oncogene Science; Bayer, Cambridge, UK).

Study Design
Informed consent and medical history were obtained,
disease extent assessed, and a tumor biopsy taken for
histology and EGFR determination in the 3 weeks
before treatment initiation. Physical examination,
ECOG performance status, assessment of concurrent
illness/treatments, hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, heart evaluation with electrocardiogram, blood
sample for soluble EGFR, and tumor markers were
obtained in the week before treatment.
Patients received gefitinib every day (250 mg
orally) starting on Day 1. FOLFOX6 was administered
on Day 1 and repeated 14 days later (Fig. 1); it was
administered on an outpatient basis via a central
venous catheter connected to a single-use elastomer
pump.
Clinical evaluation and blood tests were repeated
before each cycle; tumor assessment, tumor markers,
and soluble EGFR evaluation were performed every 2
months. Patients who responded after 4 courses continued the treatment; if the response was confirmed
after 8 courses, gefitinib maintenance therapy
(without chemotherapy) was given. The treatment was
withdrawn for disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.
Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) scale
(version 2.0). Treatment was delayed for toxicity grade
2 (except nausea or vomiting) until recovery. If treat-

Statistical Analysis
An initial cohort of 5 patients was treated with gefitinib and FOLFOX6 as detailed above and in Figure 1;
after 2 cycles (4 weeks) a full safety evaluation was
conducted. In the absence of excessive toxicity,
recruitment continued. The Fleming10 method was
used to calculate the number of patients required to
estimate the response rate. It was found that 56
patients were sufficient to give at least a 90% probability of rejecting a response rate of 50% if the true
response was [70% (clinically significant), assuming
an exact 5% 1-sided significance test. The hypothesis
that the response rate was 50% could be rejected if
40 responses were observed in 56 patients.
For all endpoints an intention-to-treat analysis
was performed on all enrolled patients who began
treatment. All other data reported are based on the
safety population. The primary endpoint of the study
was gefitinib activity in combination with FOLFOX6
estimated as the overall response rate (complete
response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) at trial
closure 6 months after the last patient’s first dose of
gefitinib.
Secondary endpoints were objective response rate
4 months after the initiation of treatment, the efficacy
of gefitinib as maintenance therapy in patients with
no disease progression after completion of combination therapy, disease control rate (CR, PR, and stable
disease [SD]), progression-free survival (PFS), overall
survival (OS), and the safety profile of gefitinib plus
FOLFOX6.
We also assessed baseline and over-time EGFR
serum levels for their ability to predict response. The
former was assessed by a logistic regression model
and the latter by Cox regression model with timedependent covariate.11 The results are reported as the
mean  standard deviation.

RESULTS
Between January 2003 and December 2004, 56
patients with a median age of 57.5 years (range, 33–76
years) were enrolled in the trial from 4 treatment centers. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Thirty-nine patients (69.6%) had synchronous metastatic disease. The most common site of metastases

was the liver (92.9%). Four patients had peritoneal
effusion.
All patients were evaluable for toxicity and 53
(94.6%) for response. The patients excluded from
response assessment had intestinal occlusion (2
patients) or diarrhea due to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (1 patient), which developed before the first assessment. A median of 8
courses (range, 1–12 courses) was given. One patient
who achieved late PR (after 8 cycles) received a further
4 cycles. Of the 425 chemotherapy cycles given, 284
(66.8%) were administered at full dose, 35 (8.2%) at
reduced dose, 75 (17.7%) at delayed full dose, and 31
(7.3%) at delayed reduced dose. Overall, 90.5% of the
planned oxaliplatin dose (mean, 90.5 mg/m2), 90.7%
of the planned 5-fluorouracil bolus (mean 362.7 mg/
m2), 88.8% of the planned 5-fluorouracil infusion
(mean 2130.8 mg/m2), and 90.6% of the planned folinic acid bolus (mean 181.2 mg/m2) were given.
Forty-one patients (73.2%) received gefitinib maintenance monotherapy for a median of 16.1 weeks (range,
3.7–46.4).
The median duration of treatment (combination
therapy plus gefitinib maintenance) was 29 weeks

(range, 1–141 weeks). CR was obtained in 3 patients
(5.36%), PR in 37 patients (66.1%), and SD in 11
patients (19.6%). Disease control (CR, PR, or SD) was
obtained in 51 patients (91.1%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 80.4–97%), CR or PR was obtained in 40
patients (71.4%; 95% CI, 57.8–82.6%), and disease progression occurred in 2 patients (3.6%).
Twelve patients did not receive gefitinib monotherapy: 5 because of disease progression at second
assessment after 8 courses, 5 because of adverse
events, 1 because of DPD deficiency, and another
because of surgery to remove liver metastases. Of the
41 patients who received gefitinib monotherapy, 23
still had disease control (2 with CR, 14 with PR, and 7
with SD) at Week 8 (first tumor assessment), 9 patients
(2 with CR, 6 with PR, and 1 with SD) had disease control at Week 16 (second assessment), and 5 patients (2
with CR, 2 with PR, and 1 with SD) had disease control
at Week 24 (third assessment).
Fourteen patients received local treatments: liver
surgery in 11 (78.5%), radiofrequency in 2 (14.29%),
and liver surgery plus radiofrequency in 1 (7.14%). Median time to progression was 7 months (range, 2.1–33
months; 95% CI, 6.2–9 months) (Fig. 2). After a median
follow-up of 15.6 months (range, 2.2–33.3 months), 35
patients (62.5%) were alive. The median survival
required by the power analysis had not been reached
at the time of the present evaluation; 81.8% were alive
at 1 year and 59.9% were alive at 2 years (Fig. 3).
Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) occurred most frequently, followed by neurologic
toxicity (paresthesia attributable to oxaliplatin), hematologic toxicity (leukopenia and neutropenia), fatigue,
and dermatologic toxicity (including folliculitis, dry
skin, and skin rash) (Tables 2 and 3). Dermatologic
toxicity is a typical side effect of gefitinib. Most toxicity

2 dehydration; another had grade 2 diarrhea;
another patient had grade 2 heartburn and anorexia;
and another patient had grade 3 pneumonitis. Five
patients (8.9%) withdrew from treatment for adverse
events considered not to be drug related: 3 with intestinal occlusions, 1 with gastroduodenitis, and 1
after intestinal perforation due the insertion of a
prosthesis.
Soluble (serum) EGFR was determined at baseline
and 2 and 4 months from initiation of treatment in 42,
28, and 24 patients, respectively, and also at 6 and 8
months after beginning treatment (during monotherapy) in 16 and 2 patients, respectively. To assess the
association between serum EGFR levels over time and
response, patients were divided into responders (CR
or PR) and nonresponders (SD or PD). Responders
had higher EGFR values over time than nonresponders. This difference was evident at baseline
(49.4  6.2 ng/mL vs 42.4  8.4 ng/mL; Wald Test
P 5 .038). At 6 months, responders had EGFR titers
(50.2  7.8 ng/mL) that were similar to those at baseline, whereas nonresponders had much lower levels
than at baseline (36.3  11.5 ng/mL). Thus, time
trends for EGFR titers appear to differ between
responders and nonresponders; however, differences

beyond 4 months were never significant because of
the small number of determinations available.

DISCUSSION
The most striking finding of this study, which to our
knowledge is first phase 2 assessment of gefitinib plus
oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy as first-line
treatment for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent metastatic CRC, is that an overall response
(CR 1 PR) was obtained in 71.4% of evaluable
patients, the majority of whom had synchronous metastatic disease at diagnosis.
In phase 1 trials gefitinib was found associated
with manageable toxicities such as acneiform skin
rash, nausea, and diarrhea. Chronic administration of
the drug does not worsen the safety profile, and supports continuous once daily administration to counter
the continuous oncogenic signaling through this receptor.6–9,12 In pooled data from 3 phase 2 trials of single-agent gefitinib, 10% of patients with advanced
nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed despite prior chemotherapy achieved objective responses.13,14 Subsequent attempts to evaluate
the single-agent efficacy of gefitinib in patients with
progressive CRC proved ineffective.15
Gefitinib combined with folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil has not been reported to demonstrate cumulative toxicity or significant pharmacokinetic interaction.
Gefitinib has also been evaluated with FOLFOX with
uncertain advantage.5,6,8
A phase 2 study investigating gefitinib at a dose of
500 mg together with second-cycle FOLFOX4 in 27
patients pretreated for metastatic CRC9 found that
33% of patients who progressed to treatment with 5fluorouracil and irinotecan had a partial remission.
This was a higher response rate than reported with
FOLFOX4 alone in previous studies. Grade 3 to 4 toxicities included neutropenia (48%), diarrhea (48%),
nausea (22%), and vomiting (15%).
EGFR-targeted agents are mainly used in patients
whose cancers overexpressed EGFR. However, no clear
correlation between EGFR overexpression and
response has been found. Nevertheless, immunohistochemical findings are subject to interobserver variability and evaluations are often performed after the
slides have been archived for many months, so that
protein degradation and loss of sensitivity is likely.16
Furthermore, immunohistochemical evaluations are
often conducted on material from the primary site,
whereas chemotherapy-treated metastatic disease
often presents a different EGFR expression pattern.
In the current study, we used the relatively low
gefitinib dose of 250 mg/day, taking our lead from the

757

results of randomized phase 2 studies in NSCLC that
showed that the lower dose was safer than and had the
same efficacy as 500 mg.13 The choice of FOLFOX6
was supported by initial investigations indicating a
positive correlation between oxaliplatin dose intensity
and response rate; however, the recent literature has
failed to confirm these results. As first-line treatments,
simplified FOLFOX6 and FOLFOX4 are characterized
by similar objective response rates, notwithstanding
the higher dose of platinum in FOLFOX6.17,18
Twenty-five percent of our patients received local
treatments for liver metastases, mainly because the
treatment was associated with sufficient shrinkage of
metastatic disease to render these treatment worthwhile. By contrast, our data regarding gefitinib as
maintenance therapy do not indicate that it is particularly useful; the median time to progression in our
patients was 7 months (range, 2.1–33 months; 95% CI,
6.2–9 months) compared with 8 to 9 months obtained
with chemotherapy alone in historical series.17,18
We found that the side effects of the combined
regimen were similar to those obtained with other
first-line oxaliplatin-containing regimens, with the
marked exception of cutaneous side effects; however,
these effects were mild and easier to manage than
those associated with the use of cetuximab.19,20 PFS
and OS were apparently similar to those reported in
other trials on nonpretreated metastatic CRC
patients.17,18
It is interesting to compare our finding with those
obtained with the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab
and panitumumab against EGFR.19,21 Phase 2 trials of
cetuximab in patients with pretreated advanced CRC
produced a 10% response rate when used alone and a
23% response rate when used in combination with irinotecan in patients refractory to irinotecan.19,20
Cetuximab plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan-containing
chemotherapy as first-line treatments are being investigated in clinical trials.
Although we had insufficient data to assess the
prognostic utility of soluble EGFR titers, our observations do suggest that high levels of circulating EGFR
may indicate better outcome. We are investigating the
relation with other biologic variables to outcomes in
patients receiving gefitinib.

Conclusions
The combination of gefitinib and oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy shows promising first-line efficacy
and manageable toxicity in patients with EGFR-positive advanced CRC. Further investigations concerning
the ‘crosstalk’ of EGFR pathways should be conducted
with the aim to propose tailored therapies.
