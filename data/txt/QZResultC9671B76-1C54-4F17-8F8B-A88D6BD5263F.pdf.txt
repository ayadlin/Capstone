Abstract
Prostate carcinoma is the most commonly diagnosed cancer
in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in
Western civilization. Androgen ablation therapy is effective in
treating androgen-dependent tumors, but eventually, androgen-independent tumors recur and are refractory to conventional chemotherapeutics. Hence, the emergence of androgen
independence is the most challenging problem in managing
prostate tumors. We report a novel mechanism of androgen
independence: calpain cleaves the androgen receptor (AR)
into an androgen-independent isoform. In vitro and in vivo
analyses show that calpain removes the COOH-terminal ligand
binding domain generating a constitutively active molecule.
Analysis of human prostate tumors indicates that several
tumors express higher levels of this truncated AR than
noncancerous prostate tissue. In transient transfection studies, the truncated AR is three to five times more potent than
the full-length receptor in transactivating transcription. The
androgen-independent Rv1 cells express high levels of the
truncated AR, and treatment of these cells with a calpain
inhibitor reduces truncated AR expression. In the absence of
androgen, inhibition of calpain activity induces apoptosis. The
HIV protease inhibitor amprenavir inhibits calpain activity
and is also effective in inducing apoptosis in the Rv1 cell line.
The cell culture studies were reproduced in a mouse xenograft
model, where, in the absence of androgens, amprenavir
significantly reduces tumor growth. Together, these studies
indicate that calpain-dependent proteolysis of the AR may be
a mechanism of androgen independence. The calpain inhibition studies suggest that inhibiting this activity may be a
potential treatment for some androgen-independent prostate
tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9001–5]

Introduction
Most prostate cancers initially present as androgen-dependent
neoplasms and therapy relies on androgen ablation aimed at
blocking androgen receptor (AR) cell signaling. Although initially
successful, androgen-independent tumors that are refractory to
such treatments eventually emerge (1). Many androgen-independent prostate cancers continue to express the AR and exhibit
reinstatement of its function. Several mechanisms may account for

AR activation in low levels of androgen: (a) AR mutations that
require low levels of androgen; (b) activation of AR by nonsteroid
ligands, such as growth factors and cytokines (2); (c) overexpression/amplification of AR or its coactivators (3); (d) locuswide histone transcriptional activation at some, but not all, AR
targets (4); and (e) proteolytic processing of the AR to an androgenindependent isoform.
The AR consists of four functional domains: an NH2-terminal
regulatory region, a DNA-binding domain, a hinge domain, and a
COOH-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD; ref. 5). The binding
of hormone to the LBD allows for translocation of the receptor into
the nucleus and recruitment of proteins to the transcription complex (6). Previous reports show that deletion of the LBD generates
an androgen-independent transcriptional activator (7).
Calpains, calcium-dependent proteinases, are ubiquitously
expressed. In general, calpains cleave proteins at a limited number
of sites to generate large polypeptides (8). Substrate specificity is
based on sequence and substrate conformation (9). Calpain activity
is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including calcium modulation, autoproteolysis, phosphorylation, intracellular distribution,
and inhibition by calpastatin (8). Interestingly, calpain 2 levels are
elevated in invasive prostate tumors and are highest in metastatic
neoplasms (10).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. LNCaP, Rv1, PC3, and MCF-7 cells were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection and propagated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37jC and 5% CO2.
Western immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing E64, leupeptin, and calpeptin
(Calbiochem), and protease inhibitor cocktail P8340 (Sigma). Proteins
(30–50 Ag) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to BA-83
membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk
in PBS/0.1% Tween. The following antibodies were used: AR (central) 441
(Ab-1; Lab Vision Corp.), AR (COOH-terminus) C-19 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), AR (NH2-terminus) PG21 (Upstate), PSA-ER-PR8 (Neo
Markers), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK; clone 4.47; Upstate). Proteins
were detected using chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia).
In vivo calpain induction. LNCaP cells were plated, cultured overnight,
pretreated with 40 Amol/L of calpeptin or DMSO for 15 min, and then
treated with 10 Amol/L ionomycin (Calbiochem) for 20 min. Cells were
harvested, lysed, and assayed as described above.
In vivo calpain inhibition. Rv1 cells (2  105) were plated in 35-mm
plates and cultured overnight. Cells were treated with DMSO, 40 Amol/L
calpeptin, or 30 Ag/mL amprenavir, for 24 or 48 h, washed with cold PBS,
and harvested. Amprenavir (GlaxoSmithKline) was provided by D.M.A. For
analysis of calpain inhibition in the presence or absence of androgens, cells
were plated at 105 in 35-mm plates and propagated in androgen-containing
or androgen-depleted media (phenol red–free media/charcoal-stripped

serum) for 48 h before addition of calpeptin, amprenavir (at 15 or
30 Ag/mL), or DMSO. Cells were refed daily for 3 days. Floating and adherent
cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/
PBS (pH 7.4) overnight at 4jC. Cells were stained with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI; 0.2 Ag/mL in 1% Triton X-100/2% paraformaldehyde)
for 30 min at 4jC in the dark, washed with PBS, spotted onto slides, dried,
coverslipped, and examined by fluorescence microscopy.
In vitro calpain assay. LNCaP cells were resuspended in calpain assay
buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1% Triton X-100]. Calpain was activated with CaCl2, and reactions
were incubated at 25jC for 60 min. Alternatively, LNCaP or Rv1 extracts
were treated with increasing concentrations of calpain 2 (Calbiochem) for
60 min at 25jC. Reactions were terminated by boiling.
Plasmid construction. The truncated form of AR (tr-AR) was generated
by PCR amplification of the sequences encoding amino acids 1 to 648 using
the primers, 5¶-GGATGGAAGTGCAGTTAGGGC-3¶ and 5¶-GGTGCTGGAAGCCTCTCCTT-3¶, followed by cloning into pCR 2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen).
Cloned sequence was excised by Xba1 and BamH1 and cloned into the
Xba1 and BamH1 sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).
Transfection and luciferase assays. PC3 cells were propagated in
control or androgen-depleted media. Cells were transfected using Effectene
(Qiagen) and analyzed as described previously (11).
Cell proliferation assay. Cellular proliferation was assessed using the
3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (Promega) following manufacturer’s recommendations.
Human prostate specimens. Tumor tissue samples, flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen, were obtained from the University of California Davis
Cancer Center Tissue Bank. Cellular extracts were prepared as described
previously (11).
Animals and xenograft studies. Rv1 xenograft studies were done
as described previously (12). Three days after castration, 4-week-old athymic
mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were injected with 1.5  106 Rv1 cells in
Matrigel (1:1). Mice were randomized into control and treatment groups.
Once tumors were measurable, mice were treated with amprenavir (160 mg/kg
in peanut oil), or vehicle daily. Animal studies were Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee approved.
Statistics. Analyses using a two-tailed Student’s t test were used to
compare two groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Error
bars represent SE.

Results
Calpain cleavage of the AR. To investigate the link between
calpain and prostate tumorigenesis, we examined the AR for
potential cleavage sites. Theoretically, the consensus calpain
cleavage site (9) between residues 648 and 649 of the human AR
would generate two polypeptides: an f80-kDa polypeptide consisting of the transactivation, DNA binding, and hinge domains and a
f30-kDa LBD. To test this possibility, LNCaP cell extracts were
treated with increasing concentrations of CaCl2 to activate calpain.
Addition of calcium promoted AR proteolysis to an f80-kDa
truncated form (tr-AR; Fig. 1A). Addition of calpain inhibitors
calpeptin or EGTA prevented proteolysis. Calpain activation was
confirmed by analysis of FAK (8). Addition of calcium promoted FAK
cleavage from a 120- to a 90-kDa form (Fig. 1A). The high calcium
levels required for proteolysis implicated calpain 2 (8). Indeed,
addition of calpain 2 resulted in the appearance of the tr-AR and a
disappearance of the full-length AR (FL-AR; Fig. 1B). In addition,
analysis using antibodies directed against the LBD showed that calpain proteolysis caused the disappearance of FL-AR and appearance
of a 30-kDa fragment (Fig. 1B), confirming deletion of this region.
Our previous study identified a novel AR mutation in Rv1 cells,
a line derived from the relapsed CWR22R-2152 human xenograft.
Rv1 cells contain a duplication of the third exon (13) that was not
detected in the parental, androgen-dependent CWR22 tumor (14),
and express an 80- to 85-kDa tr-AR that is missing the LBD.
Treatment of the Rv1 extracts with calpain 2 completely converted
the FL-AR to the tr-AR (Fig. 1C).
In vivo inhibition and activation of AR proteolysis.
Treatment of LNCaP cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin
activated endogenous calpain resulting in proteolysis of the AR to
an f80-kDa isoform (Fig. 2A). In a complementary experiment,
calpeptin treatment of intact Rv1 cells reduced the level of the
tr-AR (Fig. 2B). These in vivo results establish that the AR is a
calpain substrate.
Truncated AR is more efficient in transactivating transcription. An expression plasmid encoding tr-AR was generated to

Figure 1. The AR is a calpain substrate. A, Western immunoblot analysis (Ab: AR441) revealed that addition of CaCl2 to LNCaP extracts resulted in cleavage of the
AR to a truncated isoform. Addition of calpeptin or EGTA inhibited AR proteolysis. Addition of CaCl2 activates proteolysis of FAK to a 90-kDa isoform. B, addition of
purified calpain 2 (0.17 units/AL) to LNCaP extracts promoted AR proteolysis, which was inhibited by calpeptin. An antibody directed against the COOH-terminal
region of the AR (C-19) detected the full-length and 30-kDa COOH-terminal fragments. C, treatment of CWR22Rv1 extracts with calpain 2 resulted in the proteolysis of
the FL-AR to the truncated isoform.

determine the efficacy of the tr-AR in transactivating transcription.
In transient transfection studies, tr-AR was three to five times more
robust than FL-AR in transactivating an AR-dependent prostate
specific antigen (PSA) promoter and acted in a ligand-independent
manner (Fig. 2C). A Western blot analysis of FL-AR– and tr-AR–
transfected cells shows that the levels of AR expression is com-

parable; therefore, the increase in tr-AR activity can be attributed
to enhanced transactivation function (Fig. 2D).
Truncated AR expression in prostate tumors. To establish
the potential clinical relevance of these observations, the AR was
examined in normal and malignant prostate. Nonmalignant tissue
(benign prostatic hyperplasia) expressed very low levels of tr-AR

have much higher levels of the truncated isoform. A Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against the NH2-terminal region of the AR and tumor sample

(Fig. 3A). However, tumor samples (01, 30, and 94) expressed higher
amounts of this isoform. In tumor sample 01, tr-AR accounted for
f30% of the AR. Moreover, tumors with higher tr-AR levels had
elevated FAK cleavage, suggesting elevated calpain activity (Fig. 3B).
Inhibition of calpain activity in the absence of androgen
promotes apoptosis. Does calpain inhibition in the absence of
androgens caused reversion of the Rv1 cells to the parental
androgen-dependent phenotype? Cells proliferated in the absence
of androgen but more slowly then in androgen-containing media.
Calpeptin-treated cells survived well in the presence of androgen,
although calpeptin retarded proliferation (Fig. 3C). However, calpeptin treatment in the absence of androgens resulted in a decrease
of viable cells. A 48-h calpeptin treatment in the presence of androgens did not reduce the expression of the endogenous androgenresponsive PSA gene, whereas calpeptin treatment in the absence
of androgens reduced PSA expression significantly, suggesting a
block in AR-dependent transcription (Fig. 3D). A 72-h calpeptin
treatment in the absence of androgens induced apoptosis in f40%
of the cells, supporting the hypothesis that calpain inhibition
causes Rv1 cells to revert to an androgen-dependent phenotype
(Fig. 4A).
An HIV protease inhibitor inhibits calpain activity. Calpeptin,
while effective in cell culture studies, has limited utility for animal
studies. A previous report indicated that HIV protease inhibitors
inhibit calpain activity (15); therefore, Rv1 cells were treated with
amprenavir. The effective amprenavir dose was two or four times
the peak plasma level used in anti-retroviral therapy. Amprenavir
treatment reduced expression of tr-AR (Fig. 4B). Importantly,
treatment of Rv1 cells with amprenavir in the absence of androgens
caused the cells to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 4C).

Amprenavir inhibits tumor growth. To test the efficacy of
amprenavir in a mouse model, Rv1 tumors were established in
castrated nude mice. Amprenavir or vehicle was given daily at a
dose that is equivalent to 3.3 times the pediatric dosage used in
anti-HIV therapy. Tumor growth was followed for 6 weeks.
Amprenavir-treated mice did not exhibit any apparent toxicity
and amprenavir treatment resulted in a statistically significant
inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
The role of calpain in the etiology and progression of cancer is
supported by reports of increased calpain levels in prostate, renal,
and colorectal tumors (10, 16, 17). Calpain cleavage affects various
aspects of cell physiology and the consequences of increased
calpain activity are determined by cellular context. We and others
(18) find that the AR is a calpain substrate. The current study
shows that calpain cleaves the AR, removing the LBD to generate a
constitutively active molecule that was more robust in transactivating transcription from the PSA promoter. One potential
explanation for increased tr-AR activity is that the FL-AR has to be
activated by ligand, whereas the tr-AR is active immediately after
translation, hence exhibits enhanced activity. Alternatively, deletion
of a domain that interacts with coactivators and corepressors may
prevent recruitment of corepressors into the transcription
complex, enhancing transcription. Moreover, the tr-AR and FL-AR
may interact with a distinct subset of proteins and potentially
transactivate distinct cohorts of genes.
Western blot analysis of AR in tumor tissue detected elevated
expression of the truncated AR isoform in some tumors. This
analysis provides compelling evidence that expression of this

isoform is not a rare event restricted to relapsed cell lines derived
from a single tumor (CWR22) but a previously uncharacterized
feature of certain prostate tumors. Higher levels of FAK cleavage in
these samples suggest higher calpain activity. The role of the
truncated AR in the etiology of androgen independence is
buttressed by the identification of a Q640 termination mutation
in an androgen-independent prostate tumor (19). This mutation
results in the expression of a tr-AR missing the LBD.
Rv1 cells, but not the parental CWR22 androgen-dependent xenografts, express high levels of a COOH-terminally truncated AR.
During progression of the CWR22 cells to androgen independence,
the Rv1 line acquired an additional mutation, resulting in the insertion of sequences near the calpain cleavage site, perhaps sensitizing
the molecule to calpain-mediated proteolysis. Treatment of Rv1
cells with calpain inhibitors in the absence of androgens causes
the cells to undergo apoptosis possibly by causing reversion to
the androgen-dependent phenotype. This argues that androgenindependent growth and survival of Rv1 is in part due to the
generation of a constitutively active tr-AR.

Although HIV protease inhibitors were developed to specifically
inhibit a HIV protease, they also possess anti-calpain activity (15).
We have shown that amprenavir mimics the effects of calpeptin. If
increased calpain activity contributes to prostate tumorigenesis,
then inhibition of this activity would be an attractive therapeutic
target. The results of the current study raise the possibility that HIV
protease inhibitors may have efficacy in reducing the growth of
certain prostate tumors.
