Abstract
Redox regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling helps protect cells against
oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated whether the cytotoxicity of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
erlotinib (ERL), was mediated by induction of oxidative stress in human head and neck cancer (HNSCC)
cells. ERL elicited cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo while increasing a panel of oxidative stress parameters
which were all reversible by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Knockdown of EGFR by using siRNA similarly
increased these oxidative stress parameters. Overexpression of mitochondrial targeted catalase but not
superoxide dismutase reversed ERL-induced cytotoxicity. Consistent with a general role for NADPH oxidase
(NOX) enzymes in ERL-induced oxidative stress, ERL-induced cytotoxicity was reversed by diphenylene
iodonium, a NOX complex inhibitor. ERL reduced the expression of NOX1, NOX2, and NOX5 but induced
the expression of NOX4. Knockdown of NOX4 by using siRNA protected HNSCC cells from ERL-induced
cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Our findings support the concept that ERL-induced cytotoxicity is based
on a specific mechanism of oxidative stress mediated by hydrogen peroxide production through NOX4
signaling. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3932–40. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer cells are hypothesized to exist in a metabolic condition of increased intrinsic oxidative stress when compared
with normal untransformed cells (1–3). Metabolic oxidative
stress is thought to increase tumorigenesis by activating
redox-regulated signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival (4–8). Previous studies have shown that the
redox regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
signaling plays a major role in the protection of cancer cells
against oxidative stress (8–10).
EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates prosurvival
and progrowth signaling pathways including phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-jun
NH, kinase (11). EGFR is an important molecular target for
antineoplastic therapy as it is found to be upregulated in the
majority of lung cancers, glioblastoma, and head and neck
cancers (HNSCC) and is associated with a poor clinical prognosis (11–13).

Inhibitors of EGFR such as gefitinib, cetuximab, and erlotinib (ERL), are available clinically and have successfully been
used to treat colorectal, non–small cell lung cancer, and
HNSCC both as monotherapy and combined with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, although their mechanism of action
remains unclear (14–16). Studies have suggested that inhibition of DNA repair may be involved in the radiosensitizing
effect of EGFR inhibition because DNA protein kinases, which
are important regulators of DNA repair, are downregulated
with EGFR inhibition (16). In addition, EGFR inhibition has
been shown to cause cell-cycle arrest in G1 and change the
cell-cycle distribution of cancer cells by decreasing the percent
of cells in the radioresistant S phase (16). Finally, modulation
of downstream signaling pathways may play an important role
in the mechanism of EGFR inhibition as inhibition of downstream signaling pathways such as Akt have been shown to
induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells (8, 17).
Previous studies have shown that oxidative stress led to
EGFR phosphorylation, which conferred protection against
oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (8, 9, 18). Because EGFR
signaling is both upregulated in the majority of HNSCC and
important for cell survival, and cancer cells are under
increased metabolic oxidative stress (compared with normal
cells), we propose that cancer cells may increase EGFR
signaling to protect against metabolic oxidative stressinduced cell killing. Furthermore, if EGFR signaling is involved
in the protection of cancer cells from oxidative stress, then
inhibition of EGFR activation would be expected to increase
endogenous metabolic oxidative stress. The aim of this study
was to determine whether inhibition of EGFR signaling

induced cell killing because of oxidative stress in HNSCC cells
in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cells and culture conditions
FaDu and Cal-27 HNSCC cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). SQ20B HNSCC cells
were a gift from Dr. Anjali Gupta (Department of Radiation
Oncology, The University of Iowa). All cell lines were authenticated by the ATCC for viability (before freezing and after
thawing), growth, morphology, and isoenzymology. Cells were
stored according to the supplier's instructions and used over a
course of no more than 3 months after resuscitation of frozen
aliquots. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium containing 4 mmol/L-glutamine, 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 4.5 g/L
glucose with 10% FBS (Hyclone). Cultures were maintained
in 5% CO2 and air humidified in a 37 C incubator.
Drug treatment
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), diphenylene iodonium (DPI), pegylated catalase (CAT), and pegylated superoxide dismutase
(SOD) were obtained from Sigma. NAC was dissolved in 1
mol/L sodium bicarbonate (pH ¼ 7.0), and DPI was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). ERL (Tarceva) and Acetadote
(Cumberland Pharmaceuticals) were obtained from the inpatient pharmacy at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.
ERL was provided as a solid tablet which was ground into a
fine powder and subsequently dissolved in 100% DMSO. All
drugs were used without further purification. Drugs were
added to cells at final concentrations of 20 mmol/L NAC,
50 nmol/L DPI, 100 U/mL CAT, 100 U/mL SOD, and 10 mmol/L
ERL. The required volume of each drug was added directly to
complete cell culture media on cells to achieve the desired
final concentrations. All cells were placed in a 37 C incubator
and harvested at the time points indicated.
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were standardized for protein content, resolved
on 4% to 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with
rabbit anti-EGFR, anti–phospho-EGFR, anti–b-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-NOX1, anti-NOX2 (Abcam), goat
anti-NOX4, and anti-NOX5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by using an ECL
Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham).

Glutathione assay
Cell pellets were thawed and homogenized in 50 mmol/L
phosphate buffer (pH ¼ 7.8) containing 1.34 mmol/L diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid buffer. Total glutathione (GSH)
content was determined by the method of Anderson (20).
Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was analyzed as described previously (21). All GSH determinations were normalized to the
protein content by using the Lowry method. (22).
siRNA transfection
EGFR, NOX4, and control siRNA were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. HNSCC cells were transfected with
20 nmol/L siRNA at 80% confluence in reduced serum Eagle's
Minimum Essential Medium for 24 hours. Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) was used for transfections following protocols
provided by the manufacturer. Biochemical analyses were
done 48 to 72 hours after transfection.
Tumor cell implantation
Twenty-four female 4- to 5-week-old athymic-nu/nu nude
mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. Mice were
housed in a pathogen-free barrier room in the Animal Care
Facility at the University of Iowa and handled by using aseptic
procedures. All procedures were approved by the IACUC
committee of the University of Iowa and conformed to the
guidelines established by NIH. Mice were allowed at least
3 days to acclimate before beginning experimentation, and
food and water were made freely available. Tumor cells were
inoculated into nude mice by subcutaneous injection of
0.1 mL aliquots of saline containing 4  106 FaDu cells into
the right flank by using 26-gauge needles.
Tumor measurements
All mice started treatment 1 week after tumor inoculation.
At this point, tumors sizes ranged from 0.06 to 0.08 cm3. Mice
were evaluated daily and tumor measurements taken 3 times
per week by using Vernier calipers. Tumor volumes were
calculated by using the formula: tumor volume ¼ (length 
width2)/2, where the length was the longest dimension and
width was the dimension perpendicular to length.

PI staining for DNA content
Fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated with RNAase
A (0.1 mg/mL) for 30 minutes followed by incubation with
propidium iodide (PI) for 1 hour. DNA content of PI-stained
cells was analyzed by FACScan (Becton–Dickinson) and the
percentage of cells with G1, S, and G2/M DNA content was calculated by using MODFIT Software (Verity Software House).

In vivo drugs administration
Mice were divided into 4 groups (n ¼ 6 mice per group). ERL
group: ERL was suspended in water and administered orally
12.5 mg/kg every other day for 6 total doses. NAC group: NAC
(Acetadote; Cumberland Pharmaceuticals) was administered
i.p. 325 mg/kg every day for 10 total doses. NACþERL group:
mice were administered 325 mg/kg NAC every day (i.p.) plus
12.5 mg/kg ERL orally every other day for a total of 10 NAC and
6 ERL doses. Control group: mice were administered intraperitoneal saline every other day and water orally every day.
Mice were euthanized via CO2 gas asphyxiation or lethal
overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) when tumor
diameter exceeded 1.5 cm in any dimension.

Clonogenic cell survival experiments
Attached cells from experimental dishes were analyzed for
clonogenic survival as previously described (19).

Immunofluorescence staining
Slides were blocked for 30 minutes with normal goat serum
and incubated overnight at 4C with rabbit anti-human

pEGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:450 dilution). Secondary
detection was conducted with AlexaFluor488 anti-rabbit (Invitrogen). Counterstain was done with ToPro3 (far red). Negative control slides were obtained by omitting the primary or
secondary antibody. The images were acquired by using a BioRad Radience 2100MP confocal microscope at 60 magnification with ZEN 2009 software. Images were analyzed by quantification of the fluorescence intensity by using image analysis
and recognition software, ImageJ (NIH) and averaged for 3
animals per group for each treatment group.
Transduction of antioxidant enzymes
AdCMV Bgl II (AdEMPTY), AdCMVCAT (AdCAT), and
AdCMVMCAT (AdMCAT) were purchased from Viraquest.
Each gene was inserted into the E1 region of an Ad5 E1/
particle E3 deleted replication deficient adenoviral vector. The
adenovirus constructs were originally prepared by Dr. John
Engelhardt (AdEMPTY and AdCAT) and Dr. Andre Melendez
(AdMCAT; refs. 23, 24). Viral particles (100 multiplicity of
infection) were added to cells for 24 hours, and the media was
changed to complete media prior to each experiment. CAT
activity was measured on cell homogenates by monitoring the
disappearance of 10 mmol/L H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) in 50
mmol/L potassium phosphate (pH ¼ 7.0) spectrophotometrically at 240 nm. Activities were expressed in mk units/mg
protein as described (25).
Measurement of intracellular prooxidant levels
Attached cells were labeled with 5-(and-6)-carboxy-20 ,70 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, (DCFH, 10 mg/mL) dissolved in 0.1% DMSO for 15 minutes at 37 C or dihydroethi-

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done by using GraphPad Prism
version 5 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Differences
between 3 or more means were determined by 1-way ANOVA
with Tukey posttests. Linear mixed effects regression models
were used to estimate and compare the group-specific change
in tumor growth curves. All tests were 2-sided and carried out
at the 5% level of significance. All statistical analyses were
done at the P < 0.05 level of significance.

Results
Effect of ERL on EGFR expression
ERL, an FDA approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
was used to determine the effect of inhibiting EGFR signaling
in HNSCC cells. Figure 1A shows that in FaDu, Cal-27, and
SQ20B cells treated with 10 mmol/L ERL for 24 hours, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR, active form) was decreased without
causing significant effects on total EGFR (tEGFR). The dose of
10 mmol/L was for our studies because this dose for 24 hours
was effective at inducing moderate but significant toxicity in
our HNSCC cell model. ERL at 5 mmol/L is also capable of

of oxidative stress (26). ERL induced a significant decrease in
total GSH levels (calculated as GSHþGSSG) in only Cal-27 cells
(Fig. 2A), while inducing an increase in %GSSG [calculated as
GSSG/(GSHþGSSG)  100] in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 2B). Intracellular prooxidant production (presumably hydroperoxides) in all
cell lines was determined by measuring DCFH oxidation in the
presence and absence of ERL. ERL significantly increased DCFH
oxidation in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that 10
mmol/L ERL induces cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in HNSCC
cells as characterized by disruptions in thiol metabolism and
hydroperoxide production.

inhibiting EGFR expression after 24 hours but a significant
cytotoxic effect is not observed until 48 hours after treatment
in our HNSCC cell model (data not shown).
Effect of ERL on HNSCC cell growth and cell cycle
To examine the effect of ERL on HNSCC cell growth and
cell-cycle distribution, FaDu, Cal-27, and SQ20B cells were
treated with ERL, then counted and analyzed for PI staining at
24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment. A near complete inhibition of cellular growth was observed with 10 mmol/L ERL over
a course of 72 hours in all cell lines (Fig. 1B). We also observed
an increased accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle in all 3 cell lines after 24 hours of ERL treatment (Fig. 1C).
These results support the conclusion that ERL inhibited cell
growth in HNSCC cells by blocking the cells in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle.

EGFR knockdown induced oxidative stress in SQ20B
cells
To confirm that ERL-induced oxidative stress was because
of inhibition of EGFR signaling, EGFR expression was knocked
down with siRNA in FaDu, Cal-27, and SQ20B cells. When the
cells were analyzed for DCFH oxidation, EGFR knockdown
resulted in a significant increase in DCFH oxidation (Fig. 2D).
These results provide further support for the hypothesis that
inhibition of EGFR signaling induces oxidative stress in
HNSCC cells.

Effect of ERL on clonogenic cell survival and oxidative
stress
The cytotoxic effect of ERL was determined by analyzing
clonogenic survival in HNSCCs after 24-hour treatment with
ERL. ERL-treated (10 mmol/L) cells showed a significant reduction (40%–60%) in cell survival compared with control (Fig. 1D).
We then determined whether inhibition of EGFR with ERL
would induce oxidative stress by analyzing disruptions in
GSH (GSH/GSSG) metabolism. The GSH/GSSG redox couple
is the major thiol-disulfide antioxidant system in cells (26). The
percentage of GSH that was oxidized (GSSG) suggests a shift
toward an oxidizing environment and was used as an indicator

The effect of NAC and ERL on clonogenic cell killing
and oxidative stress
To further analyze the role of oxidative stress in ERLinduced cell killing, FaDu, Cal-27, and SQ20B cells were

treatment, then analyzed for clonogenic survival and GSH/

GSSG levels. NAC was able to completely reverse the cytotoxicity induced by ERL in FaDu and SQ20B cells and partially
(but significantly) reverse ERL-induced cytotoxicty in Cal-27
cells (Fig. 3A). NAC significantly increased total GSH levels in
all cell lines but only modestly increased total GSH levels in the
presence of ERL (Fig. 3B). In addition, NAC suppressed the
increase in %GSSG (Fig. 3C) and DCFH oxidation (Fig. 3D) that
was induced by ERL in all cell lines. These results show that
inhibition of EGFR signaling with ERL induces disruptions in
thiol metabolism and cytotoxicity consistent with oxidative
stress, which was reversed by NAC, supporting the hypothesis
that ERL-induced cytotoxicity in HNSCC cells may be related
to increased oxidative stress.
Effect of NAC on ERL-induced cytotoxicity in vivo
The in vivo activity of NAC and ERL in FaDu tumor-bearing
athymic nude mice was examined (Fig. 3E and F). The control
and NAC treatment groups showed no difference in tumor
growth (Fig. 3E), whereas ERL induced a significant inhibition
of growth in FaDu tumors when compared with control or
NAC alone (Fig. 3E). The combination of NAC and ERL
resulted in tumor growth that was not significantly different
from control or NAC-treated tumors (Fig. 3E). These results
support the conclusion that NAC is able to reverse the tumor

growth inhibition induced by ERL in FaDu cells in vivo, which
confirms the results seen in FaDu cells in vitro (Fig. 3A). When
we analyzed and quantified pEGFR levels by using immunohistochemistry in FaDu tumors treated with NAC and/or ERL
(3 mice from each group), decreased pEGFR expression was
observed in ERL-treated tumors, which was reversed with
NAC (Fig. 3F), again confirming the results seen in vitro.
Because of the small number of tumors (n ¼ 3) that were
evaluated from each group, the differences in the MFI values
for pEGFR expression (shown in Fig. 3F) between treatment
groups did not reach statistical significance.
Role of H2O2 and superoxide in ERL-induced
cytotoxicity

To identify whether H2O2 or O2 was involved in ERLinduced cytotoxicity, FaDu and Cal-27 cells were pretreated
for 1 hour with 100 U/mL pegylated CAT before treatment
with ERL for 24 hours. CAT significantly reversed ERL-induced
cytotoxicity in FaDu and Cal-27 cells (Fig. 4A). In addition,
AdMCAT but not AdCAT significantly increased intracellular
CAT activity (values above bars in Fig. 4B) and reversed ERLinduced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4B) in FaDu cells, suggesting that
mitochondrial H2O2 may be involved. In contrast, pegylated
SOD was unable to reverse ERL-induced cytotoxicity and

increased cell killing when used alone and in combination
with ERL (Fig. 4C). DHE oxidation, which is believed to be

indicative of O2
production, was not increased but
decreased in the presence of ERL (Fig. 4D). Altogether, the

results in Figure 4 suggest that H2O2 and not O2 is involved
in ERL-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress.

inhibition of EGFR signaling by ERL leads to downregulation of NOX1, NOX2, and NOX5, and activation of NOX4mediated ROS production (believed to be H2O2), which
causes oxidative stress and cell killing.

Role of NOX enzymes in ERL-induced cytotoxicity and
oxidative stress in FaDu cells
To determine whether NOX enzymes were playing a role
in ERL-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, FaDu cells
were treated with the NOX enzyme inhibitor DPI in combination with ERL for 24 hours. DPI significantly and
completely protected FaDu cells from ERL-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5A) and oxidative stress (Fig. 5B), suggesting
that ERL-induced oxidative stress may be mediated by NOX
enzymes. In efforts to identify which NOX enzymes were
involved in ERL-induced oxidative stress, levels of immunoreactive NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, and NOX5 were analyzed by
Western blot. NOX3 is not expressed in our HNSCC cell
model. Treatment of FaDu cells with ERL for 24 hours
decreased NOX1, NOX2, and NOX5 expression, however,
NOX4 expression was increased (Fig. 5C). Knockdown of
NOX4 expression by using siRNA protected the cells against
ERL-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 5D) and oxidative stress
parameters such as %GSSG (Fig. 5E) and DCFH oxidation
(Fig. 5F). Overall, these results support the hypothesis that

Metabolic oxidative stress, which is observed in cancer cells,
is thought to enhance tumor progression by activating redoxregulated signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation,
survival, and metastasis (3–10). In particular, oxidative stress
stimuli have been shown to induce autophosphorylation of
EGFR, which confers protection against oxidative stressinduced apoptosis (8–9). Exposure to anticancer agents has
been shown to induce a stress response, which includes
activation of EGFR signaling, that may be responsible for
the development of resistance to many anticancer agents in
tumor cells (27). Therefore, inhibition of EGFR signaling is a
logical strategy for enhancing oxidative stress in cancer cells
and may prevent development of resistance to conventional
chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we have provided several
lines of evidence showing that inhibition of EGFR signaling
with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ERL induces cancer cell
killing via enhancing oxidative stress.
EGFR overexpression is observed in the majority of HNSCC
cells, with the truncated mutant form of EGFR, EGFR variant
III (EGFRvIII), being detected in a fraction of HNSCC cases

Figure 5. Role of NOX enzymes in ERL-induced toxicity and oxidative stress in FaDu cells. FaDu cells were treated with 10 mmol/L ERL with or without
50 nmol/L DPI for 24 hours and then analyzed for clonogenic survival (A) and percentage GSSG (%GSSG, B). C, FaDu cells were assayed by Western

(28). The HNSCC cell lines used in this study, FaDu, Cal-27, and
SQ20B all constitutively express the activated form of EGFR
(pEGFR, Fig. 1A), with SQ20B overexpressing EGFRvIII, which
also causes its constitutive activation. We observed that ERL
inhibited cell growth in all 3 cell lines resulting in G1 arrest
(Fig. 1B and C) and clonogenic cell killing (Fig. 1D) which
supports previous data with ERL and other EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (16, 29–31).
When the effects of ERL on oxidative stress were analyzed
by monitoring GSH redox states (GSH/GSSG) and DCFH
oxidation, ERL was found to induce signiﬁcant increases in
%GSSG (Fig. 2B) and DCFH oxidation (Fig. 2C) in all 3 cell lines
compared with control cells. Confirmation that inhibition of
EGFR was responsible for ERL-induced oxidative stress was
obtained when it was shown that EGFR knockdown by using
siRNA induced a significant increase in DCFH oxidation in all
3 cell lines (Fig. 2D). We were unable to completely knockdown EGFR expression in SQ20B cells with siRNA. We believe
this is because of the high basal levels of EGFR present in
SQ20B and/or the presence of mutated EGFR in this cell line.
To further support the hypothesis that ERL can induce
oxidative stress, the nonspecific thiol antioxidant NAC was
shown to significantly suppress the increase in %GSSG and

DCFH oxidation in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 3C and D). In addition,
NAC was able to signiﬁcantly reverse the cytotoxicity induced
by ERL in all the cell lines in vitro (Fig. 3A) and in FaDu cells
in vivo (Fig. 3E), suggesting that increased oxidative stress was
causally involved in ERL-induced cytotoxicity.
Interestingly, EGFR remained phosphorylated with NAC
treatment despite the presence of ERL in FaDu cells in vitro
(data not shown) and in FaDu xenografts (Fig. 3F). Possible
explanations for this result may be that NAC bound in the
active site of EGFR, preventing ERL from binding to the ATP
binding site or NAC may be binding to ERL directly. We found
that there was no statistically significant difference in the
ability of NAC to rescue cells from the toxicity seen when NAC
was added 1 hour after ERL, relative to when NAC was added
1 hour before ERL (data not shown). These results suggest that
the direct reaction of ERL with NAC does not seem to
completely account for the protective effects of NAC and that
some other mechanism (which could include direct binding to
EGFR or inhibition of thiol-mediated redox signaling) seems
to play a role in the toxicity seen with ERL. Although, the role
of oxidative stress in ERL-induced cytotoxicity is unclear
based solely on the results observed with NAC, we have shown
that CAT and overexpression of mitochondrial targeted CAT

Erlotinib Induces NOX4-Mediated Oxidative Stress

were able to significantly reverse the effect of ERL (Fig. 4A and
B) confirming the role of H2O2-mediated oxidative stress in
ERL-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in our HNSCC
cell model. Investigating the precise interactions between
NAC, EGFR, and ERL is beyond the scope of this article but
is currently being investigated.
We next determined whether NADPH oxidase (NOX)
enzymes could be involved in ERL-induced oxidative stress in
FaDu cells. We chose to pursue these experiments in FaDu cells
because of our success with this cell line in vivo and also because
of the high siRNA transfection efficiency observed in this cell line
compared with Cal-27 and SQ20B. NOX enzymes are a family of
transmembrane enzymes (NOX1–5, Duox1 and 2) that produce
ROS in response to stimuli including growth factors (32). Pretreatment of FaDu cells with the nonspecific NOX inhibitor DPI,
significantly protected cells from ERL toxicity and oxidative
stress (Fig. 5A and B) confirming the general role of NOX
enzymes in ERL-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. However, when NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, and NOX5 expression were
analyzed in the presence of ERL, NOX1, NOX2, and NOX5 were
found to be downregulated whereas NOX4 expression was
increased in FaDu cells (Fig. 5C), suggesting that NOX4 may
be mediating the oxidative stress induced by ERL.
To determine whether ROS production via NOX4 was
responsible for ERL-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress,
we knocked down NOX4 by using siRNA in FaDu cells and
found that NOX4 siRNA significantly reversed the cytotoxicity,
%GSSG, and DCFH oxidation induced by ERL (Fig. 5D–F).
These results support the hypothesis that NOX4 plays a major
role in the oxidative stress induced by ERL. NOX4 has been
found to differ from the other NOX enzymes in that it is the
only NOX enzyme that increases fluxes of H2O2 to a greater

extent than O2 (33). In addition, NOX4 siRNA has been found

to decrease H2O2 production but not O2 production (34) and
prevent oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by TNF-a in
cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (35).
In our studies, we provide 3 lines of evidence for the
involvement of NOX4-mediated H2O2 production in ERLinduced oxidative stress: (i) ERL was able to induce DCFH
(Fig. 2C) but not DHE oxidation (Fig. 4D); (ii) CAT but not
SOD was capable of rescuing cells from ERL-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4A–C), and (iii) NOX4 knockdown was capable
of significantly suppressing the increase in DCFH oxidation
induced by ERL (Fig. 5F). Moreover, because DHE oxidation
was significantly decreased with ERL treatment (Fig. 4D)
and SOD induced HNSCC cell killing alone and in the
presence of ERL (Fig 4C), it is possible that EGFR induces

O2 production via NOX1, NOX2, and NOX5, which may
activate downstream prosurvival pathways. On the other
hand, EGFR may suppress NOX4 expression and NOX4*

induced H2O2 production probably because of the deleterious intracellular effects of H2O2. On the basis of our data,
we speculate that inhibition of EGFR signaling with ERL

downregulates O2 -induced prosurvival signaling by suppressing NOX1, NOX2, and NOX5 expression and upregulates H2O2-induced prodeath signaling by increasing NOX4
expression. However, definitive proof for this speculation
will be the subject of future work.
Efforts to determine the intracellular location of H2O2
production induced by ERL were attempted by overexpression
of CAT targeted to the mitochondria (AdMCAT) and cytosol
(AdCAT). Because AdMCAT (and not AdCAT) was able to
significantly rescue cells from ERL (Fig. 4B), these data suggest
that H2O2 production originates in the mitochondria and,
perhaps, NOX4 is located in the mitochondria. In support of
this, studies by Block and colleagues (36) showed that NOX4
was present in crude and purified mitochondria, was localized
with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker, and NOX4
knockdown reduced NOX activity in pure mitochondria from
mesangial cells and kidney cortex (36).
In summary, this article provides clear evidence in HNSCC
models supporting the hypothesis that EGFR inhibition with
ERL induces clonogenic cell killing via NOX4-mediated H2O2
production. These findings identify a novel mechanism of
action for potentially increasing the biological activity
observed with the combination of EGFR inhibitors and conventional antineoplastic agents that increase oxidative stress
including cisplatin and ionizing radiation. This biochemical
rationale also potentially represents a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing cancer cell resistance to therapy commonly
seen with EGFR inhibitors in the clinic.
