ABSTRACT
Tubeimoside-1 (TBMS1) is a potent anti-tumor phytochemical. Its functional
and molecular mode of action, however, remains elusive so far. Since angiogenesis
is essential for tumor progression and metastasis, we herein investigated the antiangiogenic effects of the compound. In a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft
model we found that treatment of CD1 nu/nu mice with TBMS1 (5mg/kg) significantly
suppressed the growth and vascularization of NCI-H460 flank tumors. Moreover,
TBMS1 dose-dependently reduced vascular sprouting in a rat aortic ring assay.
In vitro, TBMS1 induced endothelial cell apoptosis without decreasing the viability of
NSCLC tumor cells and inhibited the migration of endothelial cells by disturbing their
actin filament organization. TBMS1 further stimulated the proteasomal degradation
of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) and Tie2 in endothelial
cells, which down-regulated AKT/mTOR signaling. These findings indicate that TBMS1
represents a novel phytochemical for anti-angiogenic treatment of cancer and other
angiogenesis-related diseases.

of capillary sprouts and their interconnection to blood
perfused microvessels [10]. This process is regulated by
endothelial receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), Tie2 (TEK),
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and
ephrin receptor [11]. Binding of angiogenic growth factors
to these receptors activates pivotal downstream signaling
pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR [10, 11].
Angiogenesis is primarily driven by VEGF/VEGFR
signaling [10, 12, 13]. Several agents that specifically
inhibit this signaling have been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for the anti-angiogenic treatment of
solid tumors [14]. Unfortunately, patients often become
resistant to these agents after long-term use, which
promotes the development of second-generation antiangiogenic compounds blocking angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)/
Tie2 signaling [14]. Of interest, recent studies indicate
that compounds which simultaneously inhibit both
pathways are even more effective, because they exert
synergistic inhibitory effects on the angiogenic process
[14–16].

INTRODUCTION
Tubeimoside-1 (TBMS1) is a major active ingredient
of the Chinese medicinal herb Bolbostemma paniculatum
(Maxim) Franquet (Cucurbitaceae), which is used for the
treatment of snake venoms, inflammation and cancer [1].
Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that TBMS1
exerts direct cytotoxicity in human cancer cell lines, such
as HeLa [2], HepG2 [1, 3] and A549 [4]. In addition,
TBMS1 inhibits the growth of mouse hepatoma H22 [5],
sarcoma 180 [5, 6] and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma [5].
However, the underlying mechanisms of its anti-tumor
activity have not been clarified so far.
Angiogenesis promotes tumor growth and metastasis
[7]. The establishment of an adequate vascularization
represents the essential step from tumor dormancy to tumor
progression [8]. Excessive angiogenesis is associated
with a poor prognosis for different solid tumor types,
such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [9]. During
angiogenesis, endothelial cells proliferate and migrate
into the surrounding tissue, which results in the formation

Based on these findings, we analyzed in the present
study the anti-angiogenic effects of TBMS1. We assessed
the in vivo action of the compound on tumor vascularization
and growth in a NSCLC xenograft model. Moreover,
we performed in vitro viability and angiogenesis assays.
Finally, we investigated the intracellular mechanisms
underlying the inhibitory action of TBMS1 on endothelial
VEGFR and Tie2 signaling.

xenograft model. To further unravel the specific effects of
TBMS1 on these processes, we assessed the viability of
TBMS1-treated murine endothelial eEND2 cells, human
dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) and
the two human NSCLC cell lines NCl-H460 and A549 by
means of water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assays and
flow cytometry.
Because in our xenograft model microvessels of
murine origin invaded the developing tumors, we first
analyzed the viability of murine eEND2 cells. Our results
showed that doses of 5 to 50μM TBMS1 significantly
reduced the viability of these cells in the WST-1 assay
with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
of 12.0μM (Figure 3a). Similar results were found for
HDMEC, which were used as control endothelial cells of
human origin (Figure 3b). These cells reacted even more
susceptible to the exposure of TBMS1 with a IC50 of
7.3μM. In contrast, the cell viability of NCl-H460 cells
was only reduced when exposed to high concentrations
of 25 and 50μM of TBMS1 (Figure 3c). Accordingly, the
IC50 of the compound was markedly higher (23.3μM)
for these tumor cells when compared to the two analyzed
endothelial cell types. To exclude that this finding was
only specific for NCl-H460 cells, we tested another
NSCLC tumor cell line, i.e. A549. Here, we also found
that the cell viability of A549 cells was only reduced
when exposed to 25 and 50μM of TBMS1 with a IC50 of
18.1μM (Figure 3d).
Flow cytometric analyses revealed that doses of
5 and 10μM TBMS1 increased the number of annexin
V-positive/propidium iodide-negative early apoptotic
eEND2 cells (Figure 3e). However, in line with our WST-1
assays, exposure to these doses of TBMS1 did neither
induce apoptotic nor necrotic cell death in NCl-H460
cells (Figure 3f). Taken together, these results indicate that
endothelial cells react more sensitive to TBMS1 treatment
than NSCLC tumor cells.

RESULTS
TBMS1 action on tumor growth and
vascularization
To study the anti-cancer activity of TBMS1 in a
NSCLC xenograft model, human NCI-H460 cells were
subcutaneously injected into the flanks of vehicle-treated
and TBMS1-treated CD1 nu/nu mice. Daily administration
of 5mg/kg TBMS1 significantly reduced the volume of the
developing tumors between days 7 to 17 when compared
to that of vehicle-treated controls (Figure 1a). Accordingly,
TBMS1-treated tumors also exhibited a markedly reduced
final tumor weight (Figure 1b). Immunohistochemical
analyses at day 17 revealed that the excised tumors of
TBMS1-treated mice presented with a significantly lower
density of CD31-positive microvessels in their periphery
and center when compared to those of vehicle-treated
animals (Figure 1c-1e).
These results demonstrate that TBMS1 efficiently
suppresses tumor growth and vascularization in the
NSCLC xenograft model. Noteworthy, the animals
tolerated the daily treatment with TBMS1 well, as
indicated by normal feeding, cleaning and sleeping habits,
which did not differ from those of vehicle-treated controls.

TBMS1 action on vascular sprouting
To prove a direct anti-angiogenic effect of TBMS1
in an experimental setting excluding the influence of
tumor cells, we next performed an ex vivo aortic ring
assay. In this assay, incubation of rat aortic rings in
Matrigel stimulates the growth of vascular sprouts out of
the aortic wall. We found that this angiogenic process was
dose-dependently suppressed by TBMS1 (Figure 2a-2d).
After 6 days incubation aortic rings exposed to TBMS1
presented with a significantly reduced sprout area and
maximal sprout length when compared to vehicle-treated
controls (Figure 2e and 2f).

TBMS1 action on migration of eEND2 cells
We next investigated the effects of TBMS1 on the
migratory activity of eEND2 cells by means of a transwell
migration assay and a scratch wound healing assay. We
found that TBMS1 reduced the number of migrated
eEND2 cells in the transwell migration assay (Figure 4a4e). Moreover, TBMS1 significantly delayed the wound
closure in the scratch wound healing assay in a time- and
dose-dependent manner (Figure 4f-4j).
Endothelial cell migration is driven by the
continuous remolding of the actin cytoskeleton with
formation of filopodia, lamellipodia and stress fibers [17].
Hence, we additionally performed phalloidin staining of
both vehicle-treated and TBMS1-treated eEND2 cells
(Figure 4k and 4l). We could demonstrate that TBMS1
treatment significantly decreased the number of cells with
stress fibers (Figure 4m). This indicates that the compound

results showed that 3h after treatment with 10μM TBMS1,
the expression of VEGFR1 was only slightly reduced in
eEND2 cells and Tie1 expression was not affected at all
(Figure 5b). In contrast, expression of VEGFR2 and Tie2
was markedly suppressed (Figure  5b), indicating that
TBMS1 preferentially inhibits the expression of these two
proteins.
To clarify how TBMS1 reduces the cellular protein
levels of VEGFR2 and Tie2, we performed quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of
vehicle-treated and TBMS1-treated eEND2 cells. We
found that exposure to TBMS1 increased the relative
mRNA expression levels of VEGFR2 (Figure 6a) and Tie2
(Figure 6b) in these cells. This finding indicates that the
compound has no inhibitory effects on the transcription
and mRNA stability of VEGFR2 and Tie2.
We next analyzed the action of TBMS1 on
VEGFR2 and Tie2 protein expression in the presence
of cycloheximide (CHX), which suppresses the new
synthesis of proteins. We could demonstrate that the

TBMS1 action on VEGFR2 and Tie2 signaling
To delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying
the anti-angiogenic effect of TBMS1, we performed
Western blot analyses of eEND2 cells, which were exposed
for 0.5-3h to TBMS1 or vehicle. We found that TBMS1
significantly reduced the expression of VEGFR2 in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5a). This inhibitory effect could
already be observed after a short exposure time of only
0.5h. In addition, we detected lower expression levels of
Tie2 in eEND2 cells, which were treated for longer time
spans of 2-3h with TBMS1 (Figure 5a). In line with these
findings, the important downstream signaling pathway
AKT/mTOR was significantly down-regulated by TBMS1
treatment (Figure 5a). Besides, we analyzed the effects
of TBMS1 on the expression of two other endothelial
receptor tyrosine kinases, i.e. VEGFR1 and Tie1. Our

degradation of already present VEGFR2 and Tie2 was
markedly accelerated in TBMS1-treated eEND2 cells
when compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 6c).
Proteasomes and lysosomes are the two major protein
degradation systems in eukaryotic cells. To determine which
one of them contributes to the observed TBMS1-induced
degradation of VEGFR2 and Tie2, we pretreated eEND2
cells for 2h with the proteasome inhibitor (R)-MG-132
(MG132) or the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine diphosphate
salt (CQ) before vehicle or TBMS1 treatment. We could
show that MG132 significantly reversed TBMS1-induced
degradation of VEGFR2 (Figure 7a) and Tie2 (Figure
7b). This, however, was not observed after CQ exposure
(Figure 7c and 7d). These results indicate that TBMS1
promotes VEGFR2 and Tie2 degradation exclusively via
the proteasome.

were markedly reduced in CD31-positive microvessels of
TBMS1-treated tumors when compared to vehicle-treated
controls (Figure 8a-8d).

DISCUSSION
An increasing number of studies indicates that
TBMS1 posseses anti-cancer activity [18–22]. So far,
this has been attributed to anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects of the compound on different cancer cell
lines [1, 4, 23]. Moreover, TBMS1 causes mitochondrial
dysfunction and endoplasmatic reticulum stress [24, 25]. In
the present study, we demonstrate an important novel antitumor mechanism of TBMS1, i.e. inhibition of angiogenesis.
We first analyzed the anti-tumor action of TBMS1
in a NSCLC xenograft model. Treatment with the
compound suppressed the growth of NCl-H460 tumors.
Immunohistochemical analyses further revealed that
TBMS1-treated tumors exhibit a lower microvessel
density when compared to vehicle-treated controls.
However, under these in vivo conditions it was difficult to
clarify whether the latter observation was the main reason
for the reduced tumor growth or the consequence of a
decreased proliferation rate of the tumor cells. Therefore,
we additionally analyzed the action of TBMS1 in a rat
aortic ring assay. This ex vivo angiogenesis assay bears

To confirm our mechanistic in vitro results in our
in vivo NSCLC xenograft model, we finally performed
double immunohistochemical stainings of CD31/VEGFR2
and CD31/Tie2 within the NCl-H460 flank tumors of
vehicle-treated and TBMS1-treated mice. We could
demonstrate that both VEGFR2 and Tie2 expression levels

the major advantage that the anti-angiogenic action of
a compound can be analyzed independently from the
influence of surrounding tumor cells. Accordingly, the
aortic ring assay is frequently used for the identification
of novel anti-angiogenic agents [26–28]. By this assay
we could demonstrate that TBMS1 dose-dependently
suppresses the formation of vascular sprouts.
We next analyzed in vitro the effect of TBMS1 on
the viability and cell death of eEND2 cells, HDMEC,

NCl-H460 and A549 cells. We found that endothelial
cells of both murine and human origin reacted much more
sensitive to TBMS1 than the tumor cells. This indicates
that inhibition of angiogenesis may represent the major
mechanism of the anti-tumor activity of TBMS1. Our
in vitro data further demonstrate that TBMS1 exerts
pleiotropic anti-angiogenic effects in endothelial cells,
which not only involve the induction of apoptosis, but
also the inhibition of their migratory activity. Phalloidin

staining of the cytoskeleton of eEND2 cells showed that
the latter observation may be caused by the disturbance of
actin filament organization, which is essentially involved
in cellular migration [29].
We also investigated the molecular mechanisms
underlying the anti-angiogenic effects of TBMS1. For this
purpose, we focused on the two important angiogenesis
signaling pathways, i.e. the VEGF/VEGFR2 and the Ang2/Tie2 axis. We found that TBMS1 interferes with both
systems. Western blot analyses revealed that short-term
exposure to TBMS1 markedly reduces the endothelial
expression of VEGFR2 and Tie2, which is associated
with down-regulation of AKT/mTOR signaling. This
mode of action offers the possibility to inhibit different
steps of tumor angiogenesis. In fact, the vascularization
of a tumor initially requires the destabilization of the
surrounding normal vasculature, which is promoted by

Ang-2/Tie2 signaling [30]. Subsequently, the endothelial
cells of the microvessels are stimulated by VEGF/
VEGFR2 signaling to proliferate and migrate into the
tumor tissue [31]. Hence, the combined blockade of these
processes may markedly contribute to the anti-angiogenic
efficiency of TBMS1, comparable to the modern concept
of Ang-2 and VEGF axes combination therapies in clinical
oncology [14].
Intracellular protein expression levels are
determined by transcription, mRNA stability, translation
and degradation. We herein found that TBMS1 does
not inhibit the transcription and mRNA stability of
endothelial VEGFR2 and Tie2, but promotes the
degradation of these proteins. Previous studies could
demonstrate that similar to TBMS1, VEGF also causes
rapid degradation of VEGFR2 [32–34]. The mechanism
of VEGF-induced VEGFR2 degradation is controversially

discussed. The majority of studies indicates that VEGF
induces the lysosomal degradation of VEGFR2 [32, 33].
However, there are other reports suggesting that the
degradation of VEGFR2 can also occur in the proteasome
[34, 35]. In line with the latter reports, we found that
VEGFR2 is degraded by the proteasome and that this
degradation is enhanced by TBMS1.

So far, the degradation of Tie2 is poorly understood.
Although it has been reported that Ang-1 rapidly
stimulates Tie2 ubiquitination and degradation [36],
the primary system for its degradation has not yet been
identified. Based on our novel results we now suggest
that it is the proteasome. In fact, we could demonstrate
that treatment of endothelial cells with the proteasome

inhibitor MG132 increased Tie2 expression. Moreover,
MG132 reversed the inhibitory effect of TBMS1 on
endothelial Tie2 expression.
Taken together, the present study demonstrates
that TBMS1 inhibits angiogenesis, which is based on its
stimulatory action on proteasomal VEGFR2 and Tie2
degradation. Accordingly, TBMS1 acts as a pleiotropic
anti-angiogenic compound, which suppresses multiple
mechanisms of the angiogenic process. Hence, TBMS1
represents a promising phytochemical for the establishment
of novel anti-angiogenic treatment strategies against cancer
and other angiogenesis-related diseases.

cells were subcutaneously injected as a single cell
suspension in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into each
flank of the animals. The mice were randomly divided into
2 groups, which were daily treated with an i.p. injection of
vehicle (100μL 0.9% NaCl; control, n=8) or TBMS1 (5mg/
kg, n=8). Two perpendicular diameters of the developing
tumors were repetitively measured at day 0 (baseline), 3,
7, 10, 14 and 17 (endpoint due to excessive tumor size in
control animals) by means of a caliper. The tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula V = 1/2 (L × W2), where
L was the longest and W the shortest diameter [37]. At the
end of the in vivo experiments, the mice were sacrificed
with an overdose of the anesthetics and the tumors were
carefully excised, weighed and further processed for
immunohistochemical analyses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
TBMS1, CHX and MG132 were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany).
CQ was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen,
Germany).

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed specimens of the tumors were
embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, 2μm-thick sections
were cut and stained with a rat monoclonal anti-CD31
antibody (1:30; Dianova GmbH, Hamburg, Germany),
a rabbit polyclonal anti-VEGFR2 antibody (1:100; Cell
Signaling Technology, Frankfurt am Main, Germany)
or a goat polyclonal anti-Tie2 antibody (1:100; R&D
Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) followed by a goat-antirat IgG Alexa Fluor488-labeled (1:50; Life Technologies,
Darmstadt, Germany), a Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit
IgG secondary antibody (1:50; Dianova GmbH) or a Cy3conjugated donkey-anti-goat IgG secondary antibody
(1:50; Dianova GmbH). Cell nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33342 (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were
subsequently examined using a BX60 epifluorescence
microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). For the
quantitative analysis of the microvessel density (mm-2),
numbers of CD31-positive microvessels were counted
in four microscopic regions of interest (ROIs) in the
periphery and in one ROI in the center of each tumor
at 10x magnification. Microvascular VEGFR2 and Tie2
expression was measured in additional five randomnly
chosen ROIs of each tumor by quantifying the signal area
(% CD31 area) and signal intensity (% CD31 intensity)
using Image J software (US National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA).

Cell culture
The murine endothelial cell line eEND2 (kind gift
from the Department of Surgery, Malmö Hospital, Lund
University, Malmö, Sweden) was cultured in Dulbeccoʼs
modified Eagleʼs medium (DMEM; PAA, Cölbe, Germany)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100U/
mL penicillin and 0.1mg/mL streptomycin (PAA). The
human NSCLC cell lines NCI-H460 and A549 (ATCC,
Wesel, Germany) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FCS, 100U/mL penicillin and
0.1mg/mL streptomycin. HDMEC (PromoCell, Heidelberg,
Germany) were cultured in endothelial cell growth
medium-MV (EGM-MV; PromoCell). All cells were
cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2.

Ethical statement
All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with the German legislation on protection
of animals, the EU Directive 2010/63/EU and the NIH
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(NIH Publication #85-23 Rev. 1985) and were approved
by the local governmental animal care committee.

10μM TBMS1 was added. The aortic rings were incubated
at 37°C for 6 days with medium change on day 3, followed
by observation with phase-contrast microscopy (BZ8000; Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The area (mm2) and the
maximal length (μm) of the outer aortic vessel sprouting
were quantified using the software CapImage (version 8.5;
Zeintl, Heidelberg, Germany). In this assay, 8 aortic rings
per group were analyzed.

Briefly, eEND2 cells maintained in the culture dish
were treated with 0 (vehicle), 2.5, 5 and 10μM TBMS1
for 24h. Then, 2 × 105 treated cells in 500μL FCS-free
DMEM were seeded into the 24-well insert, and 750μL
DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS was added to the
lower well. Cells were subsequently allowed to migrate
across a polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated polycarbonate
filter with a pore size of 8μm (BD Biosciences) for 5h
at 37°C. Migrated cells on the bottom side of the filter
were fixed with methanol and stained with Dade DiffQuick (Dade Diagnostika GmbH, Munich, Germany).
The number of migrated cells was counted in 20 ROIs at
20x magnification (BZ-8000; Keyence) and expressed as
percentage of the number of migrated cells in relation to
vehicle-treated controls. For each TBMS1 concentration
tested, the assay was performed in quadruplicate.
For the scratch wound healing assay, 3 × 105 eEND2
cells in 500μL medium were seeded on a sterilized slide
in a 100mm culture dish and allowed to attach for 5h,
before 10mL DMEM medium was added. After 24h, the
confluent cell monolayer was scraped with a white pipette
tip (10μL) to generate 4 scratch wounds (i.e. 4 repeats per
group) on each slide and rinsed twice with PBS to remove
non-adherent cells. Then, fresh medium containing
0 (vehicle), 2.5, 5 and 10μM TBMS1 was added. Phase
contrast microscopic images were taken immediately
after scratching (0h), as well as after 12, 24 and 36h. Cell
migration was determined as the wound closure rate, i.e.
(original wound area - wound area at timepoint X)/original
wound area ×100%.

WST-1 assay
To assess the effects of TBMS1 on the viability of
eEND2 cells, HDMEC, NCI-H460 and A549 cells, WST1 assays (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and
were treated with vehicle (distilled water, control) or serial
dilutions of TBMS1. After 24h, 10μL WST-1 reagent per
100μL medium was added into each well. After 30min
incubation at 37°C, the absorbance of each well was
measured at 450nm with 620nm as reference using a
microplate reader (PHOmo, anthos Mikrosysteme GmbH,
Krefeld, Germany). A value of 100% was assigned to
the control group, and the concentration of TBMS1 that
reduced the number of viable cells to 50% of its maximal
inhibitory effect (IC50) was derived by an interpolate
logaritmic concentration curve. All WST-1 assays were
performed with 4 repeats in 3 independent experiments.

Flow cytometry

Phalloidin staining

The effect of TBMS1 on necrotic and apoptotic cell
death of eEND2 and NCI-H460 cells was analyzed by
means of flow cytometry in 3 independent experiments. For
this purpose, 3 × 105 eEND2 or NCI-H460 cells were seeded
in 6-well plates and treated with 0 (vehicle), 5 and 10μM
TBMS1. After 24h, the cells were stained with annexin V
and propidium iodide using an Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining
Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturerʼs protocol. For
this purpose, the cells were washed with cold PBS and
resuspended in 400μL incubation buffer. The cells were then
incubated with 5μL annexin V and 1μL propidium iodide
(100μg/mL) for 15min in the dark at room temperature.
Subsequently, flow cytometric analyses were performed
using a FACScan Instrument (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany).

To investigate the effects of TBMS1 on actin
skeleton organization of eEND2 cells, we stained F-actin
with phalloidin. For this purpose, eEND2 cells (1 × 104
per well) seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates were
exposed to vehicle or 10μM TBMS1. After 24h, the cells
were fixed in 4% formalin for 10min at room temperature,
washed twice in PBS and permeabilized for 10min with
0.2% Triton X-100, and then blocked in 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) for 30min. Cells were then stained with
Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) and Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich)
at room temperature for 30min and 10min, respectively.
After two washes in PBS, slides were mounted in
Kaiserʼs glycerol gelatin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
for fluorescence microscopy (BZ-8000; Keyence). The
number of cells with stress fibers was assessed as a
percentage of the total cell number. The analyses were
performed with 3 repeats in 3 independent experiments.

Cell migration assays
The effects of TBMS1 on endothelial cell motility
were tested by means of two different migration assays,
i.e. the transwell migration assay and the scratch wound
healing assay.
The transwell migration assay was performed as
described previously [38] with minor modifications.

containing 0.5mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)
and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (1:75 v/v; Sigma-Aldrich)
on ice for 5min. The lysate was then collected and
centrifuged for 15min at 13,000 x g (4°C). The supernatant
was saved as whole protein fraction. Protein concentrations
were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Thermo Scientific) with BSA as standard. Then,
15μg protein/lane were separated on 8% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (BioRad,
Munich, Germany). After blockade of non-specific binding
sites, membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with
a rabbit monoclonal anti-VEGFR2 antibody (1:500;
Cell Signaling Technology), a goat polyclonal anti-Tie2
antibody (0.3μg/mL; R&D Systems), a rabbit polyclonal
anti-phosphorylated (p)-AKT1/2/3 antibody (Thr308;
1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany),
a rabbit monoclonal anti-AKT antibody (1:500; Cell
Signaling Technology), a rabbit monoclonal anti-p-mTOR
antibody (Ser2448; 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology),
a rabbit monoclonal anti-mTOR antibody (1:500;
Cell Signaling Technology), a rabbit polyclonal antiVEGFR1 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
a rabbit polyclonal anti-Tie1 antibody (1:100; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) or a mouse monoclonal anti-βactin antibody (1:2,000, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by the
corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:3,000; GE Healthcare, Freiburg,
Germany). Protein expression was visualized with ECL
Western blotting substrate (GE Healthcare) and images
were acquired using a Chemocam device (Intas, Göttingen,
Germany). The intensity of immunoreactivity was assessed
using Image J software (US National Institutes of Health).
All Western blot analyses were performed in 3 independent
experiments.

(reverse) for mouse GAPDH. All PCR analyses were
performed with 3 repeats in 3 independent experiments.

Statistics
After testing the data for normal distribution and
equal variance, differences between two groups were
analyzed by the unpaired Student’s t-test. Differences
between multiple groups were analyzed by ANOVA
followed by the Student Newman Keuls test with
correction of the alpha error according to Bonferroni
probabilities to compensate for multiple comparisons
(SigmaStat; Jandel Corporation, San Rafael, CA, USA).
All values are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical
significance was accepted for a value of P<0.05.
