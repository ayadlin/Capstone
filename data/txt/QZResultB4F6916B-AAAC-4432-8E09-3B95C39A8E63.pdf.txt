Abstract
The combination of TRAIL death receptor agonists and radiochemotherapy to treat advanced cancers continues to be investigated in clinical trials. We previously showed that normal cells
with a functional DNA damage response (DDR) upregulate the
expression of death-inducing receptor DR5/TRAILR2/TNFRSF10B
in a p53-dependent manner that sensitizes them to treatment with
DR5 agonists. However, it is unclear if targeting DR5 selectively
sensitizes cancer cells to agonist treatment following exposure to
DNA-damaging chemotherapy, and to what extent normal tissues
are targeted. Here, we show that the combined administration of
the DR5 agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) and chemotherapy to wild-type mice triggered synergistic gastrointestinal toxicities (GIT) that were associated with the death of Lgr5þ crypt base
columnar stem cells in a p53- and DR5-dependent manner.

Introduction
Novel targeted therapeutics in oncology hold the promise to
selectively kill the tumor cell population with reduced toxicity to
normal tissues that hampers current standard radiochemotherapy
that often has a narrow therapeutic index. One strategy that has
been under development is the targeting of the extrinsic apoptotic

Furthermore, we conﬁrmed that normal human epithelial cells
treated with the human DR5-agonistic mAb and chemotherapeutic agents were also greatly sensitized to cell death. Interestingly, our data also indicated that genetic or pharmacologic
targeting of Chk2 may counteract GIT without negatively
affecting the antitumor responses of combined DR5 agonist/
chemotherapy treatment, further linking the DDR to TRAIL
death receptor signaling in normal cells. In conclusion, the
combination of DR5-targeting agonistic mAbs with DNA damaging chemotherapy may pose a risk of developing toxicityinduced conditions, and the effects of mAb-based strategies
on the dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy must be
considered when establishing new combination therapies.

signaling pathway for the treatment of advanced systemic malignancies. Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis inducing ligand
(TRAIL) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily.
Endogenous TRAIL and its death-inducing receptors DR4 and
DR5 (TNFRSF10B) in humans play a powerful role in tumor
immune surveillance, inﬂammation, and tumor suppression in
vivo (1–4). Ligand-dependent clustering of the DR4 and DR5
receptors and activation of downstream caspases triggers fairly
rapid and fulminant apoptosis selectively in cancer cells. The
speciﬁc molecular mechanisms that render cancer cells increasingly susceptible to apoptosis triggered through the TRAIL system
remain to be fully understood, although a role for TRAIL decoy
receptors has been suggested to protect normal cells.
Despite the observations that TRAIL death receptor agonists
(TDRA) are generally nontoxic to normal cells and are overall well
tolerated, some precautions have been suggested. Certain preparations of recombinant TRAIL have been found to be toxic to
human hepatocytes in vitro (5, 6) and some agonistic mAbs
targeting DR4 and DR5 can kill normal human hepatocytes in
vitro (7). Human hepatocytes isolated from steatotic and hepatitis
C–positive livers appear to be sensitive to both untagged and
tagged TRAIL (8). In experimental mouse models, high-dose
treatment with MD5-1, an agonistic mAb targeting mouse DR5,
triggered cholangitis with a histologic appearance reminiscent of
human primary sclerosing cholangitis (9). Some early clinical
trials reported DLTs of DR5 mAbs that may involve liver toxicity.

DR5 Targeting Triggers Gastrointestinal Toxicity

High-dose (20 mg/kg) treatment with lexatumumab resulted in
asymptomatic and reversible transaminase and amylase elevations in a phase I trial of patients with advanced malignancies
(10). Similarly, transaminitis was noted in 1 of 37 patients
subjected to apomab, an agonistic DR5 mAb (11). It is important
to note that it can be difﬁcult to attribute liver toxicity to any
particular therapy in patients with metastatic disease to the liver
especially when it is progressing. Activation of p53 has been
shown to sensitize spermatocyte-like cells to recombinant TRAIL
or DR5-targeting mAbs (12).
More recent clinical trials have focused on the integration of
DR5-targeting mAbs, which have signiﬁcantly longer plasma halflife than recombinant TRAIL, with ﬁrst-line radiochemotherapy
that remains the mainstay in oncology in order to help improve
response rates. Some data from early-phase clinical trials suggest
toxicity when DR5-targeting mAbs are administered in combination with chemotherapy. A clinical phase I and II study assessing
the DR5-targeting antibody conatumumab in combination with
FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab for the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer was unable to document an improved a response
rate with conatumumab. In general, conatumumab was well
tolerated but 5% of the patients receiving 10 mg/kg biweekly of
conatumumab experienced grade 4 diarrhea and 15% experienced grade 3 hypokalemia (13). A randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study of conatumumab in combination with
FOLFIRI for second-line treatment of mutant KRAS metastatic
colorectal cancer was able to document a trend toward improved
response in the FOLFIRI/conatumumab arm (14). However, the
potential of improved response in the FOLFIRI/conatumumab
arm was associated with a trend toward an increased number of
adverse events, such as diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, anemia,
and abdominal pain as compared with the FOLFIRI/placebo arm.
We show that targeting of DR5 in mice concomitant with
treatment with 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) and CPT-11 triggers a moribund state in the animals not present following either treatment
alone, and this phenotype is associated with p53-dependent
erosion of the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium. In the case of
CPT-11 plus DR5 targeting, this GI toxicities (GIT) is also dependent on the presence of the gene encoding cell-cycle checkpoint
kinase 2 (Chk2). GIT is preceded by apoptosis in the stem cell
region of the GI tract associated with loss of Lgr5þ cells. Furthermore, toxicity following this treatment is highly dependent on
speciﬁc components of the apoptotic machinery downstream of
the receptors in a chemotherapy-speciﬁc manner. Our results
point to an unanticipated molecular complexity of the interaction
between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways that has
relevance to proapoptotic cancer therapy combinations in the
clinic. Interestingly, we show that pharmacologic targeting of
Chk2 protects the GI epithelium and facilitates dose escalation
without negative impact when treating p53-deﬁcient syngeneic
colon cancer cells. A detailed understanding of these interactions
along with insights into their potential reversal through pharmacologic intervention may improve the therapeutic index during
cancer therapy with proapoptotic drugs that target the TRAIL
death receptor pathway.

Material and Methods
Mice and treatment
Mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Chk2/
and DR5/ mice have been described previously (3, 15) p53F/F;

www.aacrjournals.org

mT/mG; lgr5 and DR5/; mT/mG; lgr5 mice were generated in
house. All animal care and treatment procedures used were
approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
In vivo labeling of apoptotic cells
B6.129P2-Lgr5tm1(cre/ERT2)Cle/J mice were injected with SRFLIVO (ImmunoChemistry Technologies LLC) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Small intestinal crypts were isolated
as previously described (16). Labeled cells (GFPþ) and/or FLIVO
(red ﬂuorescent) were quantitated with an inverted ﬂuorescence
microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert100) coupled to a CCD camera.
Quantitation of histologic and immunohistochemical ﬁndings
All slide sections were coded, analyzed, and quantiﬁed
blindly by counting 10 randomly selected 60 or 100 image
ﬁelds of three nonserial sections of the same specimen. The area
percentage of the total GI area subjected to histologic evidence
of injury was estimated using ImageJ (NIH Image 1.62 software). Also, the number of TUNEL-positive cells (see Histology
and immunohistochemistry in Supplementary Material) was
assessed on digital images of specimens with the use of ImageJ
(NIH Image 1.62 software). Appropriate statistics were applied
to the generated data (see Statistical analysis in Supplementary
Material).
Noninvasive high-resolution near-infrared optical imaging
Noninvasive near-infrared (NIR) imaging was performed as
described previously (17).
Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant human TRAIL
Expression and puriﬁcation of rhTRAIL was carried out as
described previously (18).

Results
DR5 targeting sensitizes to the GI toxicity inﬂicted by 5-FU and
CPT-11
In order to assess the toxicity and dose–response characteristics
of two commonly used chemotherapeutics ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)
and irinotecan (CPT-11) in the absence and presence of DR5targeting mAbs, we treated mice with an isotype-speciﬁc control
antibody (IgG) or MD5-1. MD5-1 triggers apoptosis in malignant
cells that is dependent on FLIP and completely inhibited by the
pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (19). To our surprise, the supplementation of MD5-1 to either 5-FU or CPT-11 caused anorexia
and increased lethality at lower than expected doses of the
chemotherapeutic agents (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B). For example, all the mice in the 250 mg/kg
group of 5-FU (Fig. 1A, right) succumbed when challenged with
MD5-1, whereas 60% of the mice were alive when IgG was
administered in place of MD5-1. Administering MD5-1 alone at
this dose level, without the presence of either chemotherapeutic,
was not toxic to mice for an observational period of up to 90 days
(Supplementary Fig. S1C and data not shown). From the two
parameters (weight loss and moribund state) that were being
assessed, weight loss was the more sensitive endpoint (with an
approximately 2-fold lower ED50; data not shown). Subsequently,
we used weight loss area under the curve (AUC) values to generate
dose–response relationships for CPT-11 and 5-FU in the presence
or absence of the DR5-targeting mAb MD5-1 (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B; Fig. 1C and D). From the dose–response curves

it is clear that the presence of the DR5-targeting antibody MD5-1
sensitized the mice to weight loss and anorexia. The ED50 values
for CPT-11 was 416.6 mg/kg (95% CI, 383.9–452.0 mg/kg) in the
presence of control IgG and 175.7 mg/kg (95% CI, 143.5–215.2)
in the presence of MD5-1 (Fig. 1B, Table). The corresponding
values for 5-FU were 375.7 mg/kg biweekly (95% CI, 260.6–
541.6) and 106.1 mg/kg (95% CI, 97.44–115.6) in the absence
(IgG) and presence of MD5-1, respectively (Fig. 1B, Table). Thus,
based on weight loss as a toxicity endpoint, mice were able to
withstand 2.4- and 3.6-fold less CPT-11 and 5-FU, respectively,
following targeting of DR5 with agonistic mAbs in vivo. Given that
CPT-11 and 5-FU are commonly administered to patients in
combination for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer as
part of the FOLFIRI regimen, we used allometric dose-conversion
factors from human to mouse for doses of 5-FU and CPT-11 used
in clinical protocols. Following treatment with 5-FU/CPT-11/
MD5-1, we found that wild-type mice developed anorexia and
succumbed to treatment when the DR5-targeting antibody
MD5-1 was included in the treatment regimen (Fig. 1E and
F and data not shown). Interestingly, mice lacking one or both
alleles of DR5 (DR5þ/ and DR5/) were resistant to anorexia
(P < 0.001, Student t test) and protected from the lethality (P <
0.001, log-rank Mantel–Cox test) triggered by the CPT-11/5FU/MD5-1 combinatorial treatment (Fig. 1E and F). In contrast
to our ﬁndings with MD5-1, when recombinant mouse TRAIL
(rmTRAIL) or rhTRAIL was combined with CPT-11, no sustained anorexia or moribund state was encountered (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This could potentially implicate a protective
role for DcRs that may be abundantly expressed on normal
cells. Collectively, our data suggest that DR5-agonistic antibodies may exacerbate toxicity when combined with chemotherapy commonly used for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
DR5-dependent liver toxicity occurs following high-dose
treatment with MD5-1
Previously reported data have shown that liver toxicity may
arise in mice following higher doses of MD5-1 than applied here
(9). Mice that became anorexic in our model did not show visible
signs of liver choleastatic disease nor where there histologic signs
of injury in other organs than the GI tract (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). We found that MD5-1 alone was well tolerated without
any obvious signs of toxicity up to a dose level of 20 mg/kg
(Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C). Consistent with the previous
report, necropsy indicated that weight loss was well correlated
with yellow skin discoloration, enlarged gall bladders, and histologic signs of periportal loss of cholangiocytes and hepatocyte
atrophy (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Interestingly, the addition of a
single dose of CPT-11 (40 mg/kg i.v.) caused sensitization of mice
to MD5-1 with respect to choleastatic disease at a dose of 10 mg/kg
of MD5-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Furthermore, we assessed
the impact of mouse strain on the observed GIT inﬂicted by
combined DR5 targeting and chemotherapy because a strict strain
dependency has been described for the manifestation of liver
toxicity following MD5-1-exposure (9). In contrast to what has
been reported, we found that the combination of 5-FU/MD5-1
triggered anorexia and a moribund state in previously reported
"resistant" strains with a slightly delayed response compared
with that of C57BL6 (Supplementary Fig. S2E and S2F). One
exception to this was the CB17 SCID mouse strain that was
found to be highly sensitive to the 5-FU/MD5-1 combination.
This may indicate that chemotherapy sensitizes to DR5 target-

702 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

ing independently of mouse strain genetics associated with
sensitization of the liver to MD5-1 alone. Furthermore, we
aimed to test the impact of treatment of chemotherapy and
MD5-1 in mice lacking B cells because such mice have been
suggested to fail to trigger apoptosis and an antitumor
response following MD5-1 treatment (20). Curiously, such
mice were somewhat protected from GIT, as evident by a
reduction in weight accumulation in young (4–6 weeks old)
mice following treatment with CPT-11/MD5-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2G–S2I). This indicated that the presence of B cells is
not critical for the manifestation of GIT in our model in
contrast to what has been previously reported with respect
to MD5-1's activity in tumor models.
Low doses of MD5-1 trigger DR5-dependent GIT when
combined with DNA damaging chemotherapy
Necropsy of moribund animals in our MD5-1 "low-dose"
model revealed occasional hemorrhage and distension of the
distal small intestine and proximal colon whereas other organs
(liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, and brain) had a normal gross
appearance (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A and data not
shown). Histologic evidence suggested epithelial erosion, occasional lymphocyte inﬁltration, and mucosal wall thickening in the
small intestine and colon was associated with the manifestation of
toxicity (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Quantitative
analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides of the
GI tract isolated from mice of various treatments showed that
mice subjected to either the combination of CPT-11/MD5-1 or 5FU/MD5-1 had signiﬁcantly fewer intact crypts per millimeter of
alimentary tract as compared with mice treated with a combination of CPT-11/IgG (CPT-11) or 5-FU/IgG (5-FU), respectively
(Fig. 2B and C). IHC for the GI epithelial-speciﬁc marker claudin-7
or the mesenchymal-speciﬁc marker vimentin supported epithelial erosion and expansion of mesenchymal cells in the GI tract of
mice subjected to the combination of 5-FU, CPT-11, and MD5-1
(Fig. 2D and E). We used NIR imaging using the inﬂammatoryspeciﬁc probe Prosense680 (PS680) that has been previously used
to study inﬂammation in the GI tract (17). There was a clear
increase in PS680 labeling of the small intestine and colon of mice
treated with CPT-11/MD5-1 (Fig. 2F) Taken together, our data
indicate that the DR5-dependent inﬂammatory injury to the GI
tract is associated with the observed gross toxicity observed in
mice following the drug combinations 5-FU/MD5-1 and CPT-11/
MD5-1.
DR5 targeting does not exacerbate dose-limiting
myelosuppression following 5-FU and CPT-11
We assessed the impact of combining MD5-1 with chemotherapy on bone marrow (BM) toxicity, a common DLT with the
chemotherapy. Although the BM showed signs of atrophy following such treatments, this was not well correlated with a
moribund state (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Moreover, mice receiving treatment with either CPT-11 or 5-FU combined with control
IgG showed similar levels of apoptotic (sub-G1 positive) cells and
atrophy in the BM (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B and data not
shown). In order to further address the possibility that the toxicity
phenotype was a result directly of rate-limiting damage to the GI
tract, we subjected mice to whole-body g-irradiation (WBR) using
an "abdominal shield" (AS) constructed of lead covering the
mouse from the sternum to the pelvic region effectively protecting
the GI tract from radiation-induced injury and subsequently

treatment with 5-FU and MD5-1 suggested that the presence of
apoptotic cells by morphology and TUNEL staining following
both treatments (Fig. 3A–D). Loss of DR5 completely protected
the crypts from cell death induced by MD5-1 (Fig. 3D and
Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). Flow-cytometric sub-G1 analysis and in vivo FLIVO labeling of isolated intestinal epithelial cell
conﬁrmed the increased presence of apoptotic cells when DR5targeting MD5-1 antibodies was combined with CPT-11 (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). We used the untransformed
human fetal GI epithelial cell line FHs74Int to assess the impact
of DR5-targeting following CPT-11 and 5-FU. Consistent with our
mouse in vivo ﬁndings, the FHs74Int cells were sensitized to
apoptosis when the human DR5-agonistic monoclonal antibody
mAb631 was combined with either CPT-11 or 5-FU (Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). Furthermore, caspase-3/7 was increasingly activated as compared with control following mAb631
and CPT-11 (Fig. 3E). Indeed, a substantial increase in caspase3/7 activation over that of either compound alone was
observed following the combination of CPT-11/mAB631. The
combination treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited growth of the
FHs74Int cells over 72 hours in comparison to either compound alone (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, caspase-3/7 activation
following mAb631 alone was poorly correlated with long-term
cell survival of mAb631-treated FHs74Int cells. Furthermore,

www.aacrjournals.org

CPT-11 dose-dependent activation of caspase-3/7 was observed
only in the presence of mAb631 and subsequently correlated
with growth inhibition (Fig. 3G and H and Supplementary Fig.
S4G). Thus, untransformed human GI epithelium might be
increasingly sensitized to undergo apoptosis following DR5
targeting in the presence of high doses of CPT-11. Our ﬁndings
are consistent with and appear to validate our earlier mouse
model observations on apoptosis induction.
Combined selective DR5 targeting with CPT-11 and 5-FU
sensitizes Lgr5þ stem cells to cell death
It was somewhat surprising that MD5-1 triggered cell death in
the GI tract of mice without cotreatment with chemotherapy (Fig.
3A–D and Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C). However, the magnitude of the cell death and its crypt spatial involvement was altered
following the addition of either 5-FU or CPT-11. Scoring the crypt
positions most frequently affected following CPT-11/MD5-1 and
5-FU/MD5-1 treatments revealed that apoptosis (as determined
by TUNEL staining) was more frequently affecting the crypt
bottom and crypt base columnar (CBC) cells (Fig. 4A–C and
Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C). In order to verify that CBC cells
were increasingly targeted to death following the inclusion of
DR5-targeting mAbs with chemotherapy, we performed IHC for
Lysozyme C (green ﬂuorescence), a marker for paneth cells in the

DR5 Targeting Triggers Gastrointestinal Toxicity

intestine, in combination with TUNEL staining (red ﬂuorescence). Following CPT-11/MD5-1, we found that cells were
increasingly dying in the stem cell niche between paneth cells
(Fig. 4C) as compared with either treatment alone. However, the
combinatorial treatment had no such effect in DR5/ mice
subjected to CPT-11/MD5-1 (Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C).
Considering the deleterious impact the combined DR5 targeting
had on the GI cell homeostasis, we sought to address if the
inclusion of MD5-1 with chemotherapy increasingly included
Lgr5þ CBC cells in the cell death response by generating DR5/;
lgr5-EGFP-Cre-ERT2 (DR5/; lgr5þ) mice (21). These mice
express EGFP under the Lgr5 promoter and EGFP-expressing cells
can readily be detected by performing IHC for EGFP. Indeed, mice
lacking DR5 never displayed loss of EGFP-positive cells following
treatment with either CPT-11 or 5-FU combinations as compared
with treatment with single modalities of 5-FU, CPT-11, or MD5-1
(Fig. 4D and E). EGFPþ cells with apoptotic morphology were a
feature observed almost exclusively in wild-type lgr5-EGFP-CreERT2 (lgr5þ) mice treated with the combinations of either CPT11/MD5-1 or 5-FU/MD5-1 (Fig. 4D). We also used in vivo SRFLIVO labeling to detect apoptotic lgr5þ cells following crypt
isolation (Supplementary Fig. S5D and S5E and Fig. 4F). Mice
subjected to treatment with CPT-11/MD5-1 showed increased SRFLIVO uptake in GFPþ crypt cells ex vivo compared with crypts
isolated from lgr5þ mice treated with vehicle, MD5-1, and CPT-11
(Fig. 4F). Moreover fewer Lgr5þ (EGFPþ) cells were obtained
following treatment with the combination treatment of CPT-11/
MD5-1 compared with treatment with either compound alone
(Supplementary Fig. S5E). Taken together, our data indicate that
lgr5þ cells are a de novo target for selective DR5 targeting when
combined with chemotherapy.
Both 5-FU and CPT-11 triggered the stabilization of p53 in
the colonic epithelium of mice (Fig. 5A). Following 5-FU,
induction of p53, p21, and at later time points c-Myc was
observed (Fig. 5B). Expression proﬁling of colonic mRNA at 24
hours following either CPT-11 or 5-FU revealed the induction
of several "apoptosis-inducers" as well as "p53-dependent
genes" (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). Indeed, mice lacking
p53 (p53 "null") in all tissues were completely protected from
the moribundicity triggered by 5-FU/MD5-1 (Fig. 5C). We also
subjected transgenic mice lacking critical molecules for cellcycle arrest and apoptosis signaling following DNA damage to
treatment with 5-FU/MD5-1 and CPT-11/MD5-1 (Supplementary Fig. S7). Predictably, we found that the toxic responses to
both treatments in the mice required the presence of DR5
(Supplementary Fig. S7B and S7H); however, surprisingly the
reliance on caspase-3, bid, puma, and p21 to trigger GIT
was remarkably different for the two drug combinations.
Although puma was upregulated in the colonic epithelium
following treatment with either 5-FU or CPT-11, puma was
only required to trigger toxicity following 5-FU/MD5-1 (Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7I). By contrast, bid appears to be
required for toxicity following CPT-11/MD5-1, although this
trend did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.1712, log-rank
test). Loss of bid appeared to protect the colonic epithelium
from apoptosis (as evaluated by TUNEL staining) following
CPT-11/MD5-1 but not 5-FU/MD5-1 (data not shown). Interestingly, loss of the cell-cycle regulator p21 also sensitized
to CPT-11/MD5-1 (P ¼ 0.0002, log-rank test) (Supplementary
Fig. S7D, S7E, S7J, and S7K). Taken together, our data support
the requirement of intact p53 signaling to trigger GIT. However,

www.aacrjournals.org

downstream p53 targets show a differential requirement for the
triggering of GIT following DR5 targeting in combination with
chemotherapy.
In order to more speciﬁcally assess the impact of lost p53
expression in Lgr5þ cells we generated p53f/f; lgr5; mT/mG mice
that would allow deletion of p53 in Lgr5þ cells and subsequent
lineage tracking of cell progeny using the Cre-reporter mT/mG
transgene (22). Successful deletion of p53 was also assessed by
IHC for p53 on serial section of GI tracts isolated from mice
subjected to treatment with 5-FU (Fig. 5D). Deletion of the p53
gene in Lgr5þ cells through the use of p53f/f;lgr5 mice concomitantly with treatment with CPT-11/MD5-1 partially rescued
villous blunting and reduced toxicity (Fig. 5E). Furthermore,
lineage tracking of the progeny of Lgr5þ cells was improved when
p53 was deleted in Lgr5þ cells through administration of tamoxifen to p53f/f; lgr5; mT/mG mice immediately prior to treatment
with CPT-11/MD5-1 (Fig. 5F). These data indicate that Lgr5þ cells
in the GI tract are increasingly targeted when DR5 agonists are
combined with 5-FU and CPT-11.
Targeting of Chk2 prevents GIT following the combination
CPT-11/MD5-1
Considering that some key molecules involved in the proapoptotic DNA damage response (DDR) were found to be
critical determinants of the toxic response to chemotherapy
combined with DR5-targeting mAbs we hypothesized that
targeting of the cell-cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) could
potentially modulate such toxicities. Interestingly, mice lacking
the Chk2 gene (Chk2/) were susceptible to toxicity following
treatment with 5-FU/MD5-1 but not CPT-11/MD5-1 (Fig. 6A).
In fact, Chk2/ mice appeared to be completely resistant to
developing a moribund state triggered by the CPT-11/MD5-1
drug combination. These ﬁndings translated into less epithelial
atrophy and a reduction in crypt apoptosis in the colons of
Chk2/ mice following CPT-11/MD5-1 (Supplementary Fig.
S8A and 6C). Using a pharmacologic Chk2 inhibitor (Chk2
inhibitor II [CI-II]; ref. 23) resulted in a decreased moribund
state and reduced the PS680 signal from the GI tract of wild-type
mice treated with CPT-11/MD5-1 (Fig. 6D and Supplementary
Fig. S8B–S8D). Thus, our data indicate that targeting of Chk2 at
the genetic level or the kinase function of Chk2 may prevent
DLTs when the DR5 receptor is being targeted in combination
with CPT-11.
Gene expressions analysis indicated that CPT-11 triggered
repression of inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP) survivin
(birc5; ref. Fig. 6E and data not shown). We targeted expression
of survivin using siRNA in human FHs74Int cells and subjected
such cells to treatment with CPT-11/mAb631 (Fig. 6F). Indeed,
targeting of antiapoptotic survivin resulted in increased activation of caspase-3/7 following CPT-11/mAb631, suggesting
that survivin has a functional role in repressing apoptosis
following DNA damage and DR5 targeting. Given the in vivo
role of Chk2 to protect mice from toxicity following CPT-11/
MD5-1 we tested the capacity of three different Chk2 inhibitors
in PV1019 (24), CI-II, and CI-III (25) to prevent caspase-3/7
activation in FHs74Int cells following CPT-11/mAb631 (Supplementary Fig. S8E). Indeed, a dose-dependent repression of
caspase-3/7 activation was observed following cotreatment
with the Chk2 inhibitors, suggesting a functional role of Chk2
in mediating cell death in human cells following DNA damage
and DR5 targeting.

To address if the newly found molecular mechanism could be
used to reduce GIT and improve treatment efﬁcacy of the combination of CPT-11 and DR5-targeting mAbs we used a reduced
dose of CPT-11 (116 mg/kg) to treat syngeneic mouse colon
cancer cells (p53dmc/Ras/Myc) overexpressing mutated K-Ras
and c-Myc in syngeneic mice in vivo. The combination of CPT11/MD5-1/CI-II (C/M/CI-II) appeared to improve the response
rate of subcutaneous p53dmc/Ras/Myc grafts as compared with
that of mice treated with CPT-11/MD5-1/vehicle (C/M/V).
Although the observed difference in tumor load was not statistically signiﬁcantly different between the treatments at the end of

708 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

the experiment (P ¼ 0.26, Mann–Whitney test), the tumor doubling times in days for control (vehicle alone), C/M/V, and C/M/
CI-II were 2.4 (95% CI, 2.24–2.54), 4.6 (95% CI, 3.56–6.58), and
6.2 (95% CI, 4.25–11.67) indicated signiﬁcant differences
between the treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. S9A and
S9B). Interestingly, mice subjected to the combinatorial treatment
of C/M/CI-II lost less body weight throughout the experiment
than mice subjected to treatment with C/M/V (Supplementary Fig.
S9C and S9D). No sign of increased toxicity was observed in the
mice when CI-II was combined with CPT-11 and MD5-1, suggesting that the Chk2 inhibitor was "nontoxic" in this context.

In summary, our data indicate that the GIT observed in
our models differs with respect to the molecular underpinnings
in a chemotherapy-speciﬁc manner despite sharing a similar
pathologic manifestation in the GI tract of mice (Fig. 7).
Both treatments are dependent on intact DR5 and p53 signaling; however, the relative dependency on canonical downstream molecules of the p53 repsonse is altered depending
on the speciﬁc chemotherapeutic when DR5-targeting mAbs
are included. The combination of CPT-11/MD5-1 relies increasingly on a cell-cycle (p21)–dependent mechanism, bid, and
Chk2 to trigger GIT (Fig. 7A), whereas the combination of 5FU/MD5-1 relies mainly on puma to inﬂict injury to the GI tract
of mice (Fig. 7B). Although we did not address this directly,
previous data of others and ours suggest that Myc upregulation
may sensitize to DR5 targeting (26). Thus, Myc upregulation
and the inherently rapid GI epithelial regeneration following
injury might cause Lgr5þ GI stem cells to become increasingly
sensitized to death receptor agonists.

Discussion
Our work addresses the dose-limiting toxicity in the GI tract due
to combinations of chemotherapy or radiotherapy plus speciﬁc
targeting of the DR5 death receptor pathway and provides insights
that in the future may be pursued to reduce toxicities while
maintaining or improving the therapeutic index. In particular,
targeting Chk2 may be an attractive strategy to pursue further to
reduce dose-limiting toxicity in the GI tract. In order to address the
possibility of toxicity when DR5 is targeted in combination with
chemotherapy we treated mice with a DR5-agonistic mAb (MD51) in combination with 5-FU and CPT-11. Our data indicate that
low dose (1.0 mg/kg) supplementation of DR5 targeting mAbs in
combination with either 5-FU and CPT-11 is sufﬁcient to trigger
a lethal GIT syndrome in mice (Figs. 1 and 2; Supplementary
Figs. S1 and S2A–S2F). The GIT observed with combined DR5
targeting plus chemotherapy is completely dependent on the

710 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

presence of DR5 and the tumor suppressor p53 in mice (Figs. 1E
and F and 5C). Furthermore, we found that this toxicity was
dose limiting for the treatment of syngeneic colorectal tumor
grafts (Supplementary Fig. S9A–S9D) and correlated with
increased apoptosis in the TA zone of the gut as the disappearance of Lgr5þ CBC cells (Fig. 4A–C and Supplementary Fig.
S5D–S5F).
Lgr5þ crypt basal columnar cells have been reported to be
indispensible for epithelial restitution and as a predictor of
lethality in mice from the radiation-induced GI syndrome
(27–29). These prior ﬁndings are in agreement with ﬁndings in
our model, where chemotherapy (or DR5 targeting alone) is
sufﬁcient to trigger cell death in the TA zone of (ileal) small
intestinal crypts. However, cell death in the TA zone per se does not
appear to be sufﬁcient to permanently disrupt crypt homeostasis
without the addition of a DR5-targeting mAb. Thus, it seems
plausible that the result of the perturbed GI epithelial cell homeostasis could result from TA zone injury that sensitize Lgr5þ cells to
DR5 targeting. Further model development is required to address
those observations in depth and elucidate differences in death
receptor signaling between normal and stem cells in the GI tract.
Our reported data clearly stand in contrast to the majority of
preclinical ﬁndings that suggest targeting of DR5 is essentially
nontoxic to normal cells and tissues in combination with DNA
damaging chemotherapy. One potential reason for this is that
assessment of toxicity following treatment with TDRA in mice is
difﬁcult due to inherent differences between the genome of
mice and humans with respect to genes that inﬂuence TRAIL
signaling. For example, the mouse genome harbors only a
single death-inducing TRAIL receptor gene in DR5, in contrast
to humans who have two in DR4 and DR5. Subsequently,
mouse models would not be useful to address potential toxicity
of DR4 targeting that may potentially manifest in a different
manner from that of DR5 targeting. Thus, it is important to
stress that the mouse model presented here limits itself to
assessing toxicity following selective targeting of DR5 due to

DR5 Targeting Triggers Gastrointestinal Toxicity

the mentioned differences. It is unclear to what extent any of
the clinically relevant DR5 mAbs cross-react with mouse DR5
and toxicity assessment, and the establishment of a LOAEL in
rodent models may not be possible for some TDRA.
To the best of our knowledge, MD5-1 is the only reported
antibody that targets mouse DR5 in an agonistic manner. A recent
study showed that the combination of conatumumab or MD5-1
with recombinant APO2L/TRAIL greatly improved antitumor
responses (30). Both conatumumab and MD5-1 require crosslinking to exhibit antitumor activity alone (19, 31), but this
requirement is largely abrogated by the addition of APO2L/TRAIL,
potentially as a result of higher order of DR5 clustering on the cell
surface by the ligand–antibody combination (30). This study also
showed that the coadministration of MD5-1 (at a 200 times
higher dose than the one used for the majority of the experiments
in this study) together with APO2L/TRAIL triggered a gross and
histologically similar GIT to what was observed here when MD5-1
was combined with CPT-11 and 5-FU. A proposed reason for the
GIT was the abundant expression of DR5 in the GI tract of mice, a
characteristic of the mouse alimentary tract that is shared with that
of primates and humans as well, indicating a translational nature
of this particular ﬁnding.
It is unlikely that the severity of toxicity observed in our
animal model will translate directly to clinical observation for
a number of reasons. For example, the mice in this study were
given a single (high-dose) bolus of chemotherapy, whereas 5FU is administered as a cycled 46-hour intravenous infusion in
patients, a schedule that is challenging to mimic in laboratory
animal models. Subsequently, no dose adjustment would
be possible in our model nor did the mice receive supportive
care to the same extent that is typical for cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Unfortunately, chemotherapy-induced GIT is a common dose-limiting, costly and
quality-of-life prohibitive toxicity, and in contrast to preclinical animal models, accurate quantitative assessment of GIT
remains difﬁcult in patients. Estimation of GIT to such treatment is largely based on the presentation of symptoms that
may not correlate well with the extent of GI injury or its
localization in the GI tract (32). Although MD5-1 can readily
generate signiﬁcant antitumor responses in several preclinical
models (Fig. 5F and N; refs. 19, 33), such responses have not
been observed in clinical trials where DR5 targeting mAbs are
combined with chemotherapy. Therefore, the potential for
toxicity would be considered in relation to the limited
improvement of the response that may be expected when
TDRAs are integrated into current clinical chemotherapy protocols. Furthermore, our data suggest that chemotherapeutics
that inﬂict DNA damage may nonselectively lower the threshold dose to DR5-targeting mAbs in both normal and malignant
tissues or perhaps even preferentially do so in normal cells that
harbor an intact P53 response.
Based on our gained knowledge of the DDR pathways involved
in mediating toxicity following targeting of TRAIL-death receptors
in combination of chemotherapy, we aimed to assess if targeting
molecules within the DDR pathway could modulate GIT. Molecular targeting of Chk2 has previously been proposed as a method
to improve therapeutic indices for DNA-damaging modalities
such as radiotherapy (34). To our surprise, we found that mice
lacking the Chk2 gene were highly resistant to toxicity inﬂicted by
CPT-11/MD5-1 but not 5-FU/MD5-1 (Fig. 6A and B). Furthermore, pharmacologic targeting of Chk2 kinase function using a 2-

www.aacrjournals.org

arylbenzimidazole Chk2 inhibitor (CI-II; ref. 23) reduced toxicity following CPT-11/MD5-1 (Fig. 6D). Although mice devoid
of Chk2 were resistant to lethal GIT inﬂicted by CPT-11/MD5-1,
they were not protected from lethal GIT inﬂicted by CPT-11
alone following dose escalation (data to be published elsewhere). This ﬁnding indicates that the combined agonist targeting of the death receptor DR5 in the face of DNA damage
inﬂicted by the chemotherapeutic CPT-11 triggers GIT through
a molecularly distinct mechanism from that observed following
DNA damage alone.
Expression data indicate that in contrast to 5-FU, CPT-11
downregulates the expression of Survivin in a chk2-dependent
manner (Fig. 6E). Survivin is an established negative regulator of
death receptor stimuli (35) suggesting that selective upregulation
of Survivin following Chk2 targeting can prevent GIT following
CPT-11/MD5-1. Subsequently, we addressed the possibility that
targeting of Chk2 could help improve therapeutic indices of CPT11/MD5-1 when treating colorectal cancer. Indeed, in syngeneic
grafts of the mouse colorectal cancer cell line p53dmc/Ras/Myc we
were able to show that combining CI-II with CPT-11/MD5-1
resulted in reduced GIT and at the same time improved the tumor
response rate (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B). Our data indicate that this type of strategy may not only improve the tumor
response rate to treatment but also indirectly translate to increased
efﬁcacy as a DLT is prevented that otherwise may result in the
discontinuation of treatment.
Chemotherapy currently remains the mainstay in oncology,
and additional knowledge of how such modalities inﬂuence the
response to DR5 targeting could help shape strategies that minimize toxicity to normal tissues. The potential of toxicity should
also be considered when new combination therapies, including
DR5 agonists, are designed because our data indicate that DR5
targeting can augment dose-limiting toxicities of conventional
chemotherapy.
