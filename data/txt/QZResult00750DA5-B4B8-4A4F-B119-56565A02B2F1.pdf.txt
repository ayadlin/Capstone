Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members can contribute to tumorigenesis and may convey resistance to anti-cancer regimens.
Therefore, they are important targets for novel therapeutics, particularly Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 mimetics. Bcl-B (BCL-2-like protein10) is a relatively understudied member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Its physiological function is unknown, but it has been proven to
have an anti-apoptotic activity and to act as a tumor promoter in mice. In human, high Bcl-B protein expression levels correlate with
poor prognosis in various carcinomas and predict treatment resistance in acute myeloid leukemia. We here report that protein
expression level and anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-B are dictated by its ubiquitination. We demonstrate that Bcl-B is
polyubiquitinated at steady state, in a unique loop between the BH1 and BH2 domains. Mutagenesis identiﬁed lysine (K)128 as an
acceptor site for polyubiquitin chains, and K119 and K120, but not K181, as potential ubiquitination sites. Mass spectrometry
conﬁrmed K128 as a ubiquitination site and deﬁned the polyubiquitin chains as K48-linked, which was conﬁrmed by linkagespeciﬁc antibodies. Accordingly, Bcl-B proved to be an instable protein that is subject to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal
degradation at steady state. At equal mRNA expression, protein expression of a lysineless, nonubiquitinated Bcl-B mutant was
ﬁvefold higher than that of wild-type Bcl-B, demonstrating that ubiquitination is a key determinant for Bcl-B protein expression
levels. Ubiquitination controlled the anti-apoptotic capacity of Bcl-B, in response to a variety of conventional and novel anti-cancer
drugs. Certain anti-cancer drugs, known to reduce Mcl-1 protein levels, likewise downregulated Bcl-B. Together, these data
demonstrate that polyubiquitination and proteasomal turnover dictate the expression level and anti-apoptotic capacity of Bcl-B.

INTRODUCTION
The Bcl-2 protein family is characterized by Bcl-2 homology (BH)
domains that mediate the collaborative or competitive interactions between the different members. The family encompasses
the six anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-B, Bcl-w, Bcl-xL, Bﬂ-1 and
Mcl-1, many proapoptotic BH3 domain-only proteins and the
effector proteins Bax and Bak.1 In response to apoptotic stimuli,
the BH3-only proteins relocate to the mitochondria, where they
activate Bax and Bak to form large homo-multimeric pores in the
mitochondrial outer membrane. Through these pores, mediators
are released that enable the activity of initiator- and effector
caspases. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins generally localize to
the mitochondrial membrane. Here they inhibit Bax/Bak
multimerization and apoptotic execution by sequestering the
BH3 domain of BH3-only proteins, or activated Bax and Bak into a
hydrophobic groove formed by their BH1–3 domains.1
It is thought that tumor cells are generally ‘addicted’ to
overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Tumor cells
encounter many apoptotic stimuli during their growth, such as
DNA damage and hypoxia. These stressful conditions will induce
proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, and Bax/Bak may reach an
activated state. Therefore, tumor cell survival depends on high
levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members to keep the activity
of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in check.2 The anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins thus present an Achilles’ heel of the tumor cells. This

notion has led to the development of BH3 mimetics: compounds
that speciﬁcally bind to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and thereby
neutralize their function.
In mouse models of lymphoma, overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can contribute to tumorigenesis,3 as
well as resistance to conventional DNA-damaging anti-cancer
regimens.4 In human cancer, overexpression of Bcl-2 proper is the
driver of follicular lymphoma and a potential mediator of
resistance to radio- and chemotherapy.5,6 Overexpression of
other Bcl-2 family members is likewise associated with poor
prognosis and potential treatment resistance in hematopoietic
malignancies.7,8 Bcl-2 family protein overexpression may also be a
driver of solid tumor types, given the favorable response of small
cell lung carcinoma to the BH3 mimetic ABT-263.9
As Bcl-2 family proteins become oncogenic and can confer
treatment resistance upon overexpression, it is important to
understand how their protein expression levels are regulated. We
here present a key mechanism that dictates protein expression
level and anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-B (BCL-2-like protein-10).
Bcl-B is the least studied anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. It was
identiﬁed in human on the basis of homology with mouse Boo/
Diva and chicken Nr-13,10–12 and clusters phylogenetically with
Mcl-1 and Bﬂ-1.10 It is reportedly expressed in normal plasma cells
and various normal epithelial tissues.13 Although its physiological
function is largely unknown, data indicate that Bcl-B inhibits

apoptosis and can promote tumorigenesis; Bcl-B inhibited Baxinduced apoptosis12,14,15 and accelerated Em-Myc-driven leukemogenesis in mice.3 Furthermore, it was found overexpressed
in breast-, prostate-, gastric-, colorectal- and small cell lung
carcinoma.13 In addition, Bcl-B expression levels are predictive for
resistance to azacitidine in acute myeloid leukemia patients.16
We here deﬁne ubiquitin acceptor sites in Bcl-B and demonstrate its polyubiquitination on lysine K128. This targets Bcl-B for
proteasomal degradation, thus limiting its steady-state expression
levels. Ubiquitination of Bcl-B also determines its capacity to
confer resistance to conventional and novel anti-cancer agents,
including the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Our data imply that
ubiquitination controls Bcl-B expression levels, and thereby its
anti-apoptotic and oncogenic potential. This notion opens up
novel avenues for therapeutic targeting of Bcl-B in tumors that are
reliant on Bcl-B overexpression.

RESULTS
Bcl-B is ubiquitinated on speciﬁc lysine residues
To determine whether Bcl-B is a substrate for ubiquitination, we
expressed N-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type (WT)
Bcl-B together with FLAG-tagged ubiquitin in HEK 293 T cells. Cells
were lysed under denaturing conditions to break all noncovalent
protein interactions, and Bcl-B was isolated by anti-HA immunoprecipitation (IP). Immunoblotting with anti-HA monoclonal

antibody (mAb) identiﬁed Bcl-B at about 25 kDa. The anti-FLAG
mAb identiﬁed a range of ubiquitinated protein species in the WT
Bcl-B isolate (Figure 1a), most likely representing Bcl-B carrying
one, two, three or more ubiquitin moieties.
Ubiquitin is typically linked to a free amino group present on
either lysine residues or the free amino terminus of the substrate.
To test whether Bcl-B ubiquitination was lysine-dependent, all four
lysine (K) residues of Bcl-B were substituted by arginines (R),
generating a lysineless Bcl-B K/R mutant. The HA-tagged Bcl-B K/R
mutant was expressed together with FLAG-ubiquitin, and its
ubiquitination status was examined by IP and immunoblotting. In
this case, ubiquitin was completely lost from Bcl-B (Figure 1a),
demonstrating that HA-Bcl-B is directly ubiquitinated on at least
one of its four lysine residues.
To exclude that the HA-tag prevented a physiologically relevant
ubiquitination on the N terminus of Bcl-B, WT Bcl-B and its K/R
mutant were HA-tagged at the carboxy terminus. Next, their
ubiquitination status was analyzed as described above. Also in this
case, WT Bcl-B was clearly ubiquitinated and ubiquitination was
completely lost upon mutation of all four lysines (Figure 1b). We
conclude therefore that lysine residues, but not the N terminus of
Bcl-B are targeted for ubiquitination.
To gain insight in the localization of the four lysine residues, we
used a model of the Bcl-B structure that we had generated by
M4T.17 The model revealed that all four lysines are exposed and
potentially accessible to ubiquitin ligases (Figure 1c). To identify
which of the lysines served as ubiquitin acceptor site, we made

N-terminally HA-tagged Bcl-B variants with either one, two or
three of the four lysines mutated into arginines. Neither combined
double mutation of K119 and K120, nor single mutation of K128 or
K181 resulted in a major loss of ubiquitin from Bcl-B (Figure 1d).
However, upon combined triple mutation of lysines K119, K120
and K128, all ubiquitin was lost (Figure 1d), demonstrating that
these residues, but not the remaining K181 residue, can act as
ubiquitin acceptor sites in Bcl-B. Interestingly, multiple ubiquitinated protein species were found in the isolate of the Bcl-B K119,
120R double mutant (Figure 1d). As this mutant has only the K128
residue left as a possible ubiquitin acceptor site, we conclude that
Bcl-B can be polyubiquitinated on K128. The collective data
indicate that Bcl-B can be ubiquitinated on K119, K120 and/or
K128, but not on K181.

linkage-speciﬁc antibodies, but also indicated that their reactivity
was relatively weak as compared with reactivity of the antiubiquitin antibody (lanes 1, 2, 5, 10). The anti-ubiquitin antibody
speciﬁcally detected oligo- and polyubiquitinated Bcl-B (lanes 3, 4).
The K48-linkage-speciﬁc antibody also speciﬁcally reacted with BclB carrying 2, 3, 4 or more ubiquitins, but not—as expected—with
monoubiquitinated Bcl-B (lanes 7, 8). This conﬁrmed the presence
of K48-linked polyubiquitin on Bcl-B. The K63-linkage-speciﬁc
antibody detected some bands, but these were also present in the
control sample and/or did not align with the Bcl-B-ubiquitin
conjugates deﬁned by the anti-ubiquitin antibody (lanes 11, 12).
The collective data indicate that Bcl-B is polyubiquitinated,
predominantly and potentially exclusively with K48-linked chains,
with K128 acting as a primary ubiquitin acceptor site.

Bcl-B carries K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on K128
Ubiquitin ligases can ubiquitinate the substrate on other lysine
residues when the primary acceptor site has been lost by
mutation. Therefore, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) to
identify the primary ubiquitin acceptor site(s) in Bcl-B. Trypsin will
cleave ubiquitin C-terminally of R74, leaving the ubiquitin-derived
GG-peptide linked to the ubiquitination target residue of the
substrate (mass increment 114 Da). On the basis of this mass
difference, a GG-modiﬁed tryptic peptide can be distinguished
from a nonmodifed peptide by MS analysis (reviewed in
Kirkpatrick et al.18).
To obtain puriﬁed ubiquitin-conjugated Bcl-B, HEK 293 T cells
were transfected with HA-Bcl-B, followed by lysis under denaturing conditions. Subsequently, HA-Bcl-B was isolated by IP as
detailed in Materials and methods, and the precipitate was
separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electroporesis. A small
sample was run separately to deﬁne Bcl-B by immunoblotting (not
shown). This analysis revealed that the preparation contained
Coomassie-stainable amounts of nonmodiﬁed Bcl-B (band I;
Figure 2a) and slower migrating protein species, possibly
representing Bcl-B carrying one, two or three ubiquitin molecules
(bands II, III, IV; Figure 2a).
The indicated bands were excised from the gel and subjected to
trypsin treatment, after which the extracted peptides were
analyzed by MS. This conﬁrmed that bands I, II, III and IV
contained Bcl-B. Moreover, ubiquitin was found in bands II, III and
IV. The tryptic peptide of Bcl-B that contained K119 and K120 was
not found, but in bands II, II and IV, Bcl-B peptide with a GG
signature on K128 was identiﬁed (Figure 2b). Thus, MS analysis
provided the proof that residue K128 in Bcl-B is a primary
ubiquitin acceptor site.
Ubiquitin itself has seven lysines that can be ubiquitinated,
allowing the formation of different di-ubiquitin or polyubiquitin
chains. The functional signiﬁcance of the ubiquitination process
is largely dependent on the chain-type formed. For example,
K48-linked polyubiquitin chains generally target a substrate for
proteasomal degradation.19 To identify the linkage type of the
ubiquitin chains on Bcl-B, the MS data were analyzed for the
occurrence of GG-modiﬁed ubiquitin peptides. This revealed
ubiquitin peptides that were GG-modiﬁed on K48 (Figure 2c),
whereas no ubiquitin peptides were found that were GG-modiﬁed
on other lysine residues. GG-modiﬁed ubiquitin was only present in
bands III and IV that contained Bcl-B carrying more than one
ubiquitin. Therefore, these ubiquitin peptides most likely originated
from the oligo-ubiquitin species that were conjugated to Bcl-B.
To further examine the ubiquitin chains on Bcl-B, we made use
of antibodies that speciﬁcally recognize either K48- or K63-linked
ubiquitin.20 Bcl-B or control samples were generated as described
for MS and were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin
and the K48- and K63-linkage-speciﬁc antibodies. To validate
these antibodies, we simultaneously probed synthetic K48- or K63linked di-ubiquitin (Figure 2d). This veriﬁed the speciﬁcity of the

Steady-state protein expression of Bcl-B is regulated by
ubiquitination
The relative protein expression levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family members can determine whether the cell survives
certain insults or stress conditions, or goes into apoptosis. To
determine whether ubiquitination affected protein expression of
Bcl-B at steady state, we compared protein levels of the WT and
K/R mutant in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines J16 and
MOLT-4. This was done under conditions of equal mRNA
expression, as differences in protein expression are then most
likely due to post-translational effects. The cell lines were
transduced with constructs encoding WT or K/R mutant HA-BclB, followed by an internal ribosomal entry site and green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP). Next, the transduced cell populations
were sorted on equal GFP expression by ﬂow cytometry. This
should yield stable cell lines that have equal mRNA expression of
not only GFP, but also of WT or K/R mutant HA-Bcl-B, as one mRNA
encoded both proteins. GFP levels in the resulting J16 and MOLT-4
cell lines transduced with WT or K/R mutant Bcl-B were equal, as
assessed by ﬂow cytometry (Figure 3a) and immunoblotting
(Figure 3b). Under these standardized conditions, the steady-state
protein expression level of the Bcl-B K/R mutant was much higher
than that of WT Bcl-B (Figure 3b). Quantiﬁcation of the results from
multiple experiments showed that the protein expression level of
the Bcl-B K/R mutant was close to ﬁvefold higher than that of WT
Bcl-B, in both J16 and MOLT-4 (Figure 3c). These data indicate that
steady-state protein expression of Bcl-B is regulated by its
ubiquitination.

Ubiquitination dictates the half-life of Bcl-B and targets Bcl-B for
proteasomal degradation
To follow the stability and degradation of Bcl-B in detail, MOLT-4
cells expressing WT or K/R mutant HA-Bcl-B in conjunction with
GFP were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) for different periods of time. Cell lysates were
analyzed by immunoblotting for protein levels of Bcl-B, whereas
GFP was monitored as a control for equal protein loading. Within
360 min after inhibition of protein synthesis, almost all WT Bcl-B
protein had disappeared (Figure 4a). Prevention of Bcl-B
ubiquitination stabilized the protein, as shown by a decreased
degradation rate of the Bcl-B K/R mutant compared with WT Bcl-B
(Figures 4a and b). These ﬁndings were reﬁned using metabolic
pulse-chase radiolabeling. MOLT-4 cells expressing WT or K/R
mutant HA-Bcl-B were pulsed with [35S]-methione and -cysteine,
and the fate of the radiolabeled Bcl-B protein pool was followed
throughout a 6-h chase period. As with the CHX assays, we found
that WT Bcl-B was more rapidly degraded than the K/R mutant
(Figure 4c). The half-life of WT Bcl-B was calculated to be 68 min,
whereas Bcl-B K/R had an almost threefold increased half-life of
170 min (Figures 4d and e). These data indicate that Bcl-B is an
instable protein, whose half-life is to a signiﬁcant extent
determined by steady-state ubiquitination.

lines indicate ubiquitinated species of Bcl-B as detected in a-Ubi blot, specifying the presence of one (Ubi), two, three, four or more ubiquitins,
based on the molecular mass. Asterisk indicates some cross-reactivity with the light chain of the antibody used for IP and comigrating

K48-linked ubiquitin conventionally targets substrates to
the proteasome.19 Therefore, our ﬁnding that Bcl-B is
polyubiquitinated with K48-linked chains suggested that it is
subject to proteasomal degradation. To examine the mechanism

of Bcl-B degradation, J16 cells were incubated with CHX alone, or
together with either proteasome inhibitors (MG132, epoxomycin)
or lysosome inhibitors (baﬁlomycin A1, chloroquine). Proteasome
inhibitors greatly reduced the degradation of WT Bcl-B, whereas

lysosome inhibitors had no effect (Figure 4f). The protein levels of
the Bcl-B K/R mutant did not decrease dramatically upon CHX
treatment. Some degradation was observed and this could be
blocked to some extent by proteasome inhibitors (Figure 4f).
Together, these data indicate that steady-state ubiquitination of
Bcl-B promotes its proteasomal degradation and greatly shortens
its half-life.
Prevention of Ubiquitination does not affect Bcl-B localization or
its ability to interact with BH3-only proteins
Prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins inhibit the apoptotic pathway at the
mitochondrial membrane, where they sequester proapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members. To assess a possible impact of ubiquitination
on Bcl-B function, we ﬁrst determined whether the localization
of Bcl-B was affected by prevention of its ubiquitination. For
this purpose, the localization of WT and K/R mutant HA-Bcl-B
in U2OS cells was analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The N-terminal HA tag did not affect the mitochondrial
localization signal, which is present as a hydrophobic helix at the
C terminus of Bcl-B.10,12 Both WT and K/R Bcl-B primarily localized
to the mitochondria, as revealed by colocalization with the
mitochondrion-selective dye Mitotracker (Figure 5a). Image analysis
revealed that WT Bcl-B and the K/R mutant did so to a similar extent
(Figure 5b), indicating that the mitochondrial localization of Bcl-B
was not affected by deletion of its ubiquitin acceptor sites.
We subsequently examined whether prevention of Bcl-B
ubiquitination inﬂuenced its ability to interact with proapoptotic
BH3-only proteins. HEK 293 T cells were transfected to express WT
or K/R mutant HA-Bcl-B, together with Myc-tagged BH3-only
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

proteins. Bim, Bik, Puma and Noxa interacted to a similar extent
with WT and K/R mutant Bcl-B, as assessed by anti-HA IP, followed
by anti-Myc immunoblotting (Figure 5c). This indicated that
deletion of its ubiquitin acceptor sites did not affect the ability of
Bcl-B to sequester these proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. In
summary, mutation of internal lysines and consequent prevention
of ubiquitination did not affect Bcl-B localization or interaction
with its proapoptotic relatives.
Bcl-B ubiquitination regulates its capacity to protect cells against
anti-cancer therapeutics
Reportedly, Bcl-B overexpression can protect cells against
apoptosis, but only a few proapoptotic agents have been
tested.12,21,22 We aimed to extend this to clinically relevant anticancer regimens and to test whether Bcl-B ubiquitination affected
its anti-apoptotic capacity. For this purpose, we compared the
ability of WT Bcl-B and its nonubiquitinatable K/R mutant to
protect cells from a range of conventional and targeted anticancer drugs with diverse modes of action. J16 and MOLT-4 cells
were employed, that have a mutant and WT p53 status,
respectively. We used the cell lines expressing GFP only, WT HABcl-B or its K/R mutant at equal mRNA levels (described in
Figure 3). The cells were treated with a dose range of the
toposiomerase inhibitor etoposide and the microtubule destabilizer vincristine as conventional agents, and the BH3 mimetic
ABT-737,23 the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine and
the death receptor agonist tumor necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) as novel targeted agents. For
TRAIL, only J16 was included, as MOLT-4 cells are not sensitive to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Cell death was monitored after 48 h by
propidium iodide uptake. It was apoptotic in all cases, as
determined by inhibition with a pan-caspase inhibitor and by
nuclear fragmentation (results not shown). In both cell lines, WT
Bcl-B provided very little protection to any of the drugs (Figure 6).
However, as compared with WT Bcl-B, the Bcl-B K/R mutant
provided signiﬁcant protection, particularly to ABT-737 in both J16
and MOLT-4 cells, but also to etoposide and vincristine in both cell
types, and to roscovitine and TRAIL in J16 (Figure 6).
To exclude that the HA-tag impacted on the anti-apoptotic
function of Bcl-B, we also tested J16 cells expressing untagged
versions of Bcl-B WT and K/R, side by side with J16 cells expressing
HA-tagged Bcl-B. This revealed that untagged and HA-tagged Bcl-B
provided cells with similar levels of protection against etoposide and
ABT-737 (Supplementary Figure S1). Moreover, also for untagged BclB, the K/R mutant provided signiﬁcantly more protection to both
stimuli than the WT protein (Supplementary Figure S1). We conclude
that ubiquitination of Bcl-B regulates its steady-state expression level
and, thereby, its capacity to protect cells against a diverse array of
conventional and targeted anti-cancer drugs.
Roscovitine, etoposide and vincristine downregulate Bcl-B protein
levels, as they do for Mcl-1
It has been reported that certain anti-cancer agents reduce
protein expression levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Mcl-1,
and thus facilitate tumor cell killing.24–26 Roscovitine lowers Mcl-1
levels by blocking transcription,24 but vincristine and etoposide
promote Mcl-1 degradation by activating the E3 ligases SCFFBW7
(Wertz et al.25) and Mule,26 respectively. To investigate whether
such modes of regulation also apply to Bcl-B, we treated J16 cells
stably expressing WT Bcl-B with roscovitine, etoposide or
vincristine in a time course. Samples were subjected to
immunoblotting for endogenous Mcl-1, actin and HA-Bcl-B.
Treatment with roscovitine and etoposide rapidly reduced Mcl-1
protein levels (Figure 7), as previously reported.24,26 Interestingly,
Bcl-B protein levels were reduced to a similar extent in response to
these two drugs. Vincristine also reduced Bcl-B and Mcl-1 levels,
but with slower kinetics. This is consistent with a mutation in the

Figure 4. Ubiquitination targets Bcl-B for proteasomal degradation. (a) MOLT-4 cells stably expressing WT or K/R mutant HA-Bcl-B in an
internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)–GFP configuration were treated with CHX (50 mg/ml) for the indicated time periods. Cell lysates were
analyzed by immunoblotting for Bcl-B (a-HA) and GFP as a stable protein and loading control (a-GFP). Antibodies were labeled with
fluorescent dyes to allow read-out on the Odyssey infrared imager. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.
(b) Quantification of three independent experiments such as shown in a. Data represent mean ±s.d. Bcl-B signal intensity was corrected for
GFP signal intensity in the same cells, the 0-min time point was set to 100% and data points were connected by a one-phase decay curve fit.
(c) The same cell lines as in a were labeled with [35S]-cysteine and -methionine for 30 min, followed by a chase with nonradioactive amino
acids for the indicated time periods. Bcl-B was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb and resolved by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electroporesis.
Radioactive signals were quantified by phosphorimaging. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.
(d) Quantification of three independent experiments such as shown in c. Data represent mean ±s.d. Local background was subtracted

with CHX, either alone or together with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 (MG, 50 mM) or epoxomicin (EPX, 10 mM), or the lysosome inhibitors
bafilomycin A1 (BAF, 1 mM), or chloroquine (CHQ, 200 mM). After 8 h of treatment, cell lysates with equal protein content were analyzed by
immunoblotting for Bcl-B (a-HA) or actin (a-actin). Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Numbers above blot

Mcl-1 ligase SCFFBW7 that has been reported for Jurkat cells,27 from
which the J16 cell line is derived. Thus, Bcl-B might be subject to
the same modes of regulation as Mcl-1. The data imply that
treatment outcome may be determined by steady-state Bcl-B
turnover, but also by drug-induced Bcl-B degradation.
DISCUSSION
Overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members allows
tumor cells to survive the many prodeath signals they encounter
during their rapid growth under unfavorable circumstances. In
addition, it can provide them with resistance against anti-cancer
drugs. In this study, we show that the capacity of Bcl-B to protect
cells against apoptosis is controlled by its ubiquitin-mediated
proteasomal degradation.
IP experiments and MS data revealed that Bcl-B was polyubiquitinated on internal lysines. Mutations of the lysines into
argines showed that three out of the four lysines of Bcl-B can serve
as ubiquitin acceptor sites and that K128 is polyubiquitinated.
A crystal structure of Bcl-B was recently reported,28 but it does not
include the regions in the molecule that contain the lysines. Our
homology-based model closely matches this structure and
Oncogene (2013) 5439 – 5448

indicates that the deﬁned ubiquitin acceptor site K128 and the
potential acceptor sites K119 and K120 reside in the previously
identiﬁed unstructured loop between the BH1 and BH2
domains,10,29 speciﬁcally between a-helices 5 and 6 (Figure 1c).
This suggests that these three lysines are highly exposed and,
therefore, can be efﬁciently targeted for ubiquitination. We found
that K181 is not ubiquitinated, possibly because its location is too
distant from the active site of the ubiquitination machinery.
Alternatively, it might be inaccessible because of its proximity to
the trans-membrane domain. Interestingly, the unstructured loop
containing K119, K120 and K128 is not found in any other human
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein.29 The loop region is also highly
variable within vertebrate species in both sequence and length.
However, the conservation within primates is high, possibly
pointing at a recent evolutionary role for Bcl-B ubiquitination.29
Lysineless, nonubiquitinatable Bcl-B was more stable than WT
Bcl-B, demonstrating that ubiquitination targets Bcl-B for degradation. Accordingly, we found that Bcl-B is degraded by the
proteasome. However, preventing ubiquitination of Bcl-B did not
completely prevent its proteasomal degradation. Possibly, Bcl-B
can also be degraded by an ubiquitin-independent proteasomal
pathway, as has been shown for the Bcl-2 family members Mcl-1

Figure 5. The lysineless Bcl-B K/R mutant behaves like WT Bcl-B in terms of localization and interactions with BH3-only proteins. (a) Subcellular
localization. U2OS cells transfected to express HA-Bcl-B and Life-Act-GFP were stained to detect nuclei (DAPI, 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole),
mitochondria (Mitotracker Deep Red) and Bcl-B (anti-HA), and examined by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Representative cells of
multiple independent experiments are shown. (b) Colocalization of Mitotracker and HA-Bcl-B signal of experiments such as shown in a was

K/R, respectively. (c) Interaction with BH3-only proteins. HEK 293 T cells were transfected to express WT or K/R mutant HA-Bcl-B, together with
Myc-tagged Bik, Bim, Puma or Noxa. Cells were lysed in CHAPS buffer and Bcl-B was isolated by IP with anti-HA mAb. Total cell lysates (TCL)
and precipitates (IP) were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-a-HA or a-Myc antibody. Data shown are representative of multiple
independent experiments.

and Bim.30,31 Recently, Beverly et al.32 also described that
lysineless Bcl-B is more stable that WT Bcl-B. This correlated with
improved oncogenic potential, as the mutant more potently
accelerated Em-Myc-driven leukemogenesis than WT Bcl-B.
In contrast to our data, these authors conclude that in HEK 293
T cells, ectopically expressed Bcl-B is exclusively monoubiquitinated on multiple lysine residues, based on coexpression with
lysineless HA-tagged ubiquitin. We cannot exclude that multiple
monoubiquitin species can be appended on to a single Bcl-B
molecule, but our data using a Bcl-B mutant with only one
acceptor lysine residue clearly indicate that Bcl-B is polyubiquitinated on K128. Furthermore, both MS analysis and probing with
validated linkage-speciﬁc antibody revealed that WT Bcl-B carries
K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. Moreover, we show that Bcl-B is
targeted for proteasomal degradation in agreement with the
canonical function of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains.19 We
therefore conclude that polyubiquitination of Bcl-B drives its
rapid degradation.
We demonstrate here that Bcl-B can protect tumor cells against
various novel and conventional anti-cancer treatments, provided
that it is expressed at high-enough levels. In T-leukemic cells, WT
Bcl-B provided resistance against the BH3 mimetic ABT-737, but
not against roscovitine, etoposide, vincristine and TRAIL. Upon
expression at the same mRNA levels, protein levels of the
nonubiquitinatable Bcl-B K/R mutant were higher than those of
WT Bcl-B, due to its decreased proteasomal turnover. In contrast to
WT Bcl-B, Bcl-B K/R provided resistance against all tested anticancer treatments, in both p53-WT and p53-mutant leukemic cells.
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

As Bcl-B K/R behaves like WT Bcl-B in terms of BH3-only protein
binding and localization, this demonstrates that ubiquitination
controls the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-B. This implies that loss
of Bcl-B ubiquitination in cancer cells, which may occur by defects
in its ubiquitination machinery or overexpression of its deubiquitinating enzyme(s), may promote resistance to diverse therapies.
Interestingly, roscovitine, etoposide and, to a lesser extent,
vincristine reduced Bcl-B protein levels. Etoposide and vincristine
are known to induce degradation of Mcl-1.25–26 As these drugs
reduced Bcl-B and Mcl-1 protein levels with similar kinetics,
degradation of both proteins may be regulated by the same
mechanism. Roscovitine, on the other hand, can block Mcl-1
transcription. Thereby, it mediated a rapid drop in Mcl-1 protein
levels, given the inherent instability of Mcl-1.24 On the basis of this
principle, translation inhibitors are now under clinical evaluation
to kill chronic myeloid leukemia cells33 that depend on high Mcl-1
protein levels.34 Our data suggests that these various anti-cancer
drugs could be useful in tumor types that depend on Bcl-B for
survival or treatment resistance.
These ﬁndings also have implications for cancer therapy with
BH3 mimetic drugs. ABT-737 and its clinically applied orally
available analog ABT-263 are selective for certain anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins. In the cellular context, ABT-737 targets Bcl-2, Bcl-xL
and Bcl-w with different efﬁcacy,22,35 but not Bﬂ-1, Mcl-136,37 and
Bcl-B.22 Given that expression levels of Bﬂ-1,38 Mcl-139 and Bcl-B
are determined by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation,
stimulation of their degradation may alleviate ABT-737 resistance,
as already demonstrated for Mcl-1.40

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Constructs
The cDNA encoding full-length human Bcl-B (ImaGenes, Berlin, Germany)
was cloned into modiﬁed versions of pEGFP-N or pEGFP-C, in which the
enhanced GFP coding sequence was replaced by a double HA-tag
sequence. The N-terminal HA-tag was modiﬁed to contain a serine and
aspartate in front of the HA-tag, to make it a target for N-terminal
acetyltransferase A.43 Point mutants of Bcl-B were obtained by sitedirected mutagenesis PCR. For retroviral transduction, N-terminally
HA-tagged WT Bcl-B cDNA and its K/R mutant were cloned into pMSCVIRES-GFP. In addition, pMSCV constructs were created encoding untagged
WT and K/R mutant Bcl-B. The plasmids pcDNA3-FLAG-Ubiquitin44 and
Liveact-GFP45 have been described. The cDNAs encoding full-length human
Bik, Bim, Puma and Noxa were obtained from Geneservice Ltd (Cambridge,
UK) and cloned into pCDNA3 with a double Myc-tag at the N terminus.

resulted in high Mcl-1 levels and correlated with poor prognosis

The T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines J16 and MOLT-4 were cultured in
Iscove’s modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium and the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS,
the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293T and its derivative PhoenixAmpho were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium. Transfections
of cDNA were carried out in serum-free medium with polyethyleneimine at a
DNA:polyethyleneimine ratio of 1:3 (w/w). Retroviral particles were produced
in the Phoenix-Ampho cell line. Retroviral transduction of J16 and MOLT-4
cells was performed as described.46 Upon integration of the retroviral
construct in the host cell genome, Bcl-B and GFP proteins are expressed
from the same mRNA, because of the presence of a ribosomal entry site.
Transduced cells expressing WT or K/R mutant Bcl-B were sorted on equal
GFP signal using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The
resulting stable cell lines used for analysis are polyclonal, representing
thousands of cells of the J16 or MOLT-4 cell lines used for transduction.

Western blotting
SDS–polyacrylamide gel electroporesis was performed as described,44 and
blotting was performed using the Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit antiGFP polyclonal,47 mouse anti-Actin mAb MAB1501R (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-Mcl-1 S-19 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA),
rabbit anti-Actin mAb D6A8 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit antiUbiquitin mAb Apu3 (K63-speciﬁc) and Apu2 (K48-speciﬁc) (Millipore),
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Flag mAb M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA), mouse anti-Ubiquitin mAb P4D1 (Santa Cruz), and
ﬂuorochrome-conjugated anti-HA mAb 12CA5, anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (both
puriﬁed in house) and anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorochromes
DY-682 (HA) or DY-800 (Myc, FLAG) were from Dyomics (Jena, Germany).
Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were from LI-COR (Lincoln, NE,
USA). Fluorescence signals were visualized and quantiﬁed on the Odyssey
Imaging System (LI-COR), and chemiluminescence signals (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) by the ChemiDoc imaging system (BioRad) or exposure to ﬁlm, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK.

Immunoprecipitation
For analysis of Bcl-B ubiquitination, HEK 293 T cells were collected 24 h
after transfection and lysed in SDS buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS,
0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol) 10 min, 95 1C. Next, nine volumes of NP40 buffer were added and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at
17 000 g for 10 min at 4 1C. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with
anti-HA mAb 12CA5 and Protein G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences). For analysis of Bcl-B interactions, transfected HEK 293T cells were
incubated with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH (10 mM). IPs were
performed in Chaps buffer directly (Noxa) or after ﬁxing with formaldehyde
as described (Bik, Bim, Puma).22,48 For MS, HEK 293T cells were collected

Figure 7. Certain anti-cancer agents reduce Bcl-B and Mcl-1 protein levels. J16 cells stably expressing HA-tagged Bcl-B were incubated for
indicated periods with etoposide (5 mg/ml), roscovitine (100 mM) or vincristine (5 ng/ml). Lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for Bcl-B
(anti-HA) and endogenous Mcl-1. Actin levels served as a control for equal loading. Data shown are representative for at least two
independent experiments.
24 h after transfection in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 2 mM
N-ethylmaleimide and lysed in SDS buffer. After quenching with NP-40, IP
was performed with anti-HA mAb 12CA5, bound protein was eluted from
the Protein G beads with SDS buffer, after which a second IP in excess NP40 buffer was performed with anti-HA 3F10 afﬁnity matrix (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). This eluate was separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electroporesis and the gel was Coomassie-stained with SimplyBlue
SafeStain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Cell death assays
To assess cell death, cells were plated in round-bottom 96-well plates, at
25 000 cells/well in 100 ml Iscove’s modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium. Stimuli
were given in 100 ml Iscove’s modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium, keeping the
solvent constant, and cells were subsequently placed in the incubator.
After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and subsequently stained with
propidium iodide (1 mg/ml) in PBS with bovine serum albumin for 5 min, to
monitor dead cells. Cells were analyzed on a FACSArray (BD Biosciences),
equipped with a plate loader.

Mass spectrometry
For MS analysis, selected bands were cut from the gel and reduced with
dithiothreitol. To avoid false-positive interpretation of ubiquitination,49 the
N-methylated form of iodoacetamide was used as alkylation reagent instead
of standard iodoacetamide. Trypsin digestion was performed using the
Proteineer DP digestion robot (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). The tryptic peptides
were extracted from the gel, lyophilized, dissolved in 95/3/0.1 v/v/v water/
acetonitril/formic acid and subsequently analyzed by online nano highperformance liquid chromatography MS/MS. An 1100 HPLC system (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)50 coupled to a 7-T LTQ-FT Ultra mass
spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA, USA) was used, essentially as
described51 and detailed in Supplementary Materials and methods.

ml) for the indicated periods of time. Cells were lysed in NP-40-buffer and
subjected to western blotting. For metabolic pulse-chase labeling, MOLT-4
cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free medium,
followed by a 30-min pulse with medium with [35S]-methionine and
-cysteine (1 mCi/ml total, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Subsequently,
the medium was removed and replaced with complete medium containing 5 mM additional unlabeled methionine and cysteine. At the indicated
time points, a cell sample was withdrawn, and cells were washed, lysed in
NP-40 buffer and subjected to anti-HA IP and SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electroporesis. Imaging and quantiﬁcation were performed on a phosphorimager (Fujiﬁlm, Tokyo, Japan).

We thank Lennert Janssen, Drs Ricky Johnstone, Henning Walczak and Huib Ovaa for
kindly providing reagents, and Drs Abdel Aouacheria and Mark Hinds for advise on
the Bcl-B protein structure. This work was supported by grant ECHO 700.57.008 from
the Netherlands Organization for Scientiﬁc Research and grant NKI 2008-4110 from
the Dutch Cancer Society, awarded to JB, and GMCJ was supported by the
Netherlands Proteomics Center.

Confocal laser-scanning microscopy
At 24 h after transfection, U2OS cells were stained with Mitrotracker Deep
Red (Invitrogen), ﬁxed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min, quenched with
125 mM glycine in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X 100 in PBS.
Cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min to
block nonspeciﬁc antibody binding, after which rat anti-HA mAb 3F10
(1:100, Roche) was added, followed by Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-rat
IgG (Invitrogen) and DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Next, cells were
mounted onto slides using Fluor-gel (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Hatﬁeld, PA, USA). Images were taken on a TCS SP5 microscope (Leica,
Wetzlar, Germany) and colocalization was quantiﬁed using the Intensity
Correlation Analysis plugin and ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Reagents
Stock solutions were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide for etoposide,
epoxomicin, CHX, chloroquine diphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), Q-VD-OPH
(SM Biochemicals, Yorba Linda, CA, USA), ABT-737 (Chemietek, Indianapolis, IN, USA), MG132 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), r-roscovitine
(Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and baﬁlomycin A1 (Santa Cruz).
Vincristine in solution for injection was from Faulding Pharmaceuticals Plc
(Warwickshire, UK). Soluble recombinant Isoleucine Zippered TRAIL46 and
di-ubiquitin molecules52 have previously been described.
