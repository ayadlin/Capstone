transcriptional silencing. The DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)
inhibitors 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR)
can cause global DNA demethylation and induce the reexpression
of silent genes in addition to inhibiting the growth of numerous
tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo (3).
Covalent modifications of histone NH2-terminal tails affect
chromatin structure and the interaction of DNA with transcriptionregulatory proteins, thereby modulating gene expression. Histone
deacetylases (HDAC) remove acetyl groups from conserved lysines
within the histone tails resulting in compaction of chromatin
structure and thus the repression of gene transcription. Numerous
HDAC inhibitors have been shown to deregulate gene expression
and inhibit tumor growth both in vitro and in animal models of
various cancers by causing hyperacetylation of nucleosomal
histones of different target genes (4). Many of these inhibitors are
in clinical trials at this time and have already shown promising
antitumor activity (5). Most studies have used trichostatin A (TSA),
a potent HDAC inhibitor, in combination treatments; however, we
chose to study 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), which is less cytotoxic
and already established in clinical practice.
DNA methylation and histone modifications are dynamically
linked in the epigenetic control of gene expression and play an
important role in tumorigenesis (3). Various in vitro experiments
have shown that DNMT inhibitors, such as 5-aza-CdR, and HDAC
inhibitors, such as PBA, are highly synergistic in the reinduction
of silenced genes, in the inhibition of cell growth, and in the promotion of apoptosis (6–10). In mice treated with a carcinogen,
low doses of 5-aza-CdR and PBA were synergistic in the prevention
of lung tumor development (11).
Two well-studied targets of epigenetic drugs are the cell cycle
regulators p16 and p21. The promoter CpG island of the p16
gene is frequently silenced by DNA hypermethylation in cancer
(12, 13), which can be removed by demethylating agents. In addition,
p21 contains a CpG island in its promoter, which has been reported
to be methylated in different tumors, although less frequently than
p16 (14). Furthermore, p53, a direct upstream inducer of p21, is often
mutated in tumors and thereby limits p21 expression. HDAC
inhibitors are able to directly induce p21 in a p53-independent
manner by causing hyperacetylation of the p21 locus (15).
We determined the doses of 5-aza-CdR and PBA, which led to either
cell cycle arrest or to apoptosis in cancer cells and we compared the
induction and chromatin states of the cell cycle regulators p16 and p21
in various cancer and normal cell lines at these doses. We analyzed the
effects of the drug combination on normal fibroblasts, which are
actively dividing, to learn more about the possible consequences of
epigenetic therapy on normal tissues. One potential problem with
epigenetic therapy is that demethylated promoters often undergo a
slow remethylation and resilencing after treatment with DNA
methylation inhibitors (16). A main focus of our work therefore was
to study the long-term effects of combination treatment of cancer
cells. Intriguingly, inhibition of HDAC after demethylation did not

Abstract
Epigenetic drugs are in use in clinical trials of various human
cancers and are potent at reactivating genes silenced by DNA
methylation and chromatin modifications. We report here the
analysis of a set of normal fibroblast and cancer cell lines after
combination treatment with the DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) and the histone
deacetylase inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA). Low doses of
the drug combination caused cell cycle arrest, whereas high
doses induced apoptosis in T24 bladder carcinoma cells. Both
p16 (CDKN2A/INK4) and p21 (CIP1/SDI1/WAF1) expression
were induced to similar levels in normal and cancer cells in
a dose-dependent fashion after combination treatments. We
detected a distinct increase of histone H3 acetylation at lysine
9/14 near the transcription start sites, in both LD419 normal
fibroblasts and T24 bladder carcinoma cells, whereas the
acetylation changes in the p21 locus were less apparent.
Interestingly, the levels of trimethylation of histone H3 on
lysine 9, which usually marks inactive chromatin regions and
was associated with the p16 promoter in silenced T24 cells,
did not change after drug treatments. Furthermore, we
provide evidence that the remethylation of the p16 promoter
CpG island in T24 cells after 5-aza-CdR treatment cannot be
halted by subsequent continuous PBA treatment. The p16
gene is resilenced with kinetics similar to 5-aza-CdR only–
treated cells, which is also marked by a localized loss of
histone acetylation at the transcription start site. Altogether,
our data provide new insights into the mechanism of
epigenetic drugs and have important implications for epigenetic therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):346–53]

Introduction
DNA methylation occurs at the C-5 position of cytosine residues
in CpG dinucleotides, which are found at a lower than expected
frequency in mammalian DNA but are clustered in CpG-rich areas
called ‘‘CpG islands’’ (1, 2). These islands are often found close to
promoters and are usually unmethylated in normal somatic tissues,
whether the gene is transcriptionally active. This is in contrast to
tumor cells, in which aberrant region-specific hypermethylation of
CpG islands located in or near gene promoters is associated with

slow the remethylation and resilencing of the p16 gene and caused
a reversion to a repressive chromatin conformation.

Materials and Methods
Tissue culture. T24 (bladder transitional carcinoma cells), CFPAC-1
(pancreatic carcinoma cells), CALU-1 (lung carcinoma cells), NCCIT
(embryonal carcinoma cells), and CCD-1070SK (human normal fibroblasts)
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
LD98, LD419, and T1 (human normal fibroblasts) were established in
our laboratory and PC3 (prostate carcinoma) was kindly provided by
Dr. Gerry Coetzee (Department of Urology, Norris Comprehensive Cancer
Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los
Angeles, CA). LD98, LD419, T1, and T24 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. CFPAC-1 cells were
propagated in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 10% FCS and
1 glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). CALU-1 cells were kept in
McCoy’s 5A supplemented with 10% FCS and 1 glutamine. PC3 cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 with 5% FCS. CCD-1070SK cells were cultured in MEM
containing 10% FCS, 1 sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), and 1 MEM
nonessential amino acids. NCCIT cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS.
All cultures were kept in a humidified incubator at 37jC in 5% CO2.
Drug treatment. To determine the optimal drug doses, T24 cells were
treated with increasing doses of 5-aza-CdR (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 24 h, the
medium was changed the following day, and cells were harvested on day 3.
PBA was given in the indicated doses for 3 days continuously. For long-term
experiments (population doublings, DNA remethylation studies), T24 cells
were seeded at 2,500/cm2 and treated with 1 or 3 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR 24 h later.
After another 24 h, the medium was changed and cells were allowed to
recover for 24 h, and then 1 or 3 mmol/L PBA (Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.,
Milwaukee, WI) was added. Medium and PBA were replaced every day. Cells
were counted every 6 days using a Beckman Coulter Counter Z1 (Hialeah, FL).
For reverse transcription analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays, cells were treated with 1 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR and 1 mmol/L PBA
(low dose) or 3 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR and 3 mmol/L PBA (high dose) concurrently, 24 h after seeding. 5-Aza-CdR was omitted after 24 h of treatment, PBA treatment was continued, and the drug was replaced every 24 h.
Quantitation of DNA methylation levels. Genomic DNA was bisulfite
converted as described previously (17). After amplification of bisulfiteconverted DNA with primers specific for converted DNA, methylation levels
were measured by Ms-SNuPE (18). Sequences for primers for bisulfite-PCR
and Ms-SNuPE can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
Histone preparation and Western blots. Total histones were prepared
by acidic extraction and resolved on 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as
described previously (19). Antibodies used for Western blotting were
directed against acetylated histone H3 lysine 9/14, acetylated histone H4
lysine 5/8/12/16, and histone H4 and were all obtained from Upstate
Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells (1  106) were
pelleted by centrifugation, washed in 1 PBS, and fixed in 5 mL of 85%
ice-cold ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were centrifuged and the pellet
was resuspended in 1 mL dye solution, containing 0.1% Triton X-100,
0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.05 mg/mL RNaseA, and 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide
in PBS. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a Becton Dickinson
FACSCalibur (Franklin Lakes, NJ) in the University of Southern California/
Norris Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility.
Annexin V staining. For apoptotic assays, the Annexin V Staining kit
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Total RNA (2-5 Ag) was used for reverse transcription.
Following incubation with DNaseI (Invitrogen), to eliminate possible DNA
contamination, SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Promega, Madison, WI) were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. Quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done using an Opticon light cycler
(MJ Research/Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with dual-fluorescence-labeled probes

Results
Determination of drug doses. Optimal doses of PBA and 5-azaCdR were determined by monitoring the effects of increasing doses
of 5-aza-CdR on DNA demethylation and PBA on histone hyperacetylation in T24 bladder cancer cells (Fig. 1). ‘‘Low dose’’ was
defined as the dose of either drug leading to detectable changes
and ‘‘high dose’’ as the dose leading to a plateau in change in DNA
demethylation or histone acetylation. Substantial demethylation
of p16 exon 1 was observed after 24 h of treatment with 1 Amol/L
5-aza-CdR and a maximal effect (f50%) was seen after addition of
3.3 Amol/L of the drug (Fig. 1A). As expected, PBA treatment did
not affect the hypermethylation of the p16 gene (Fig. 1A). Histone
acetylation after drug treatment was examined by probing a
Western blot of total histone preparations with an antibody
recognizing acetylated histone H4 (lysine 5, 8, 12, and 16; Fig. 1B).
Whereas 5-aza-CdR treatment had no effect on global histone H4
acetylation, increasing amounts of PBA caused a dose-dependent
hyperacetylation of H4. Because 1 mmol/L PBA led to detectable
changes and 3 mmol/L to a maximal change in acetylation, we
chose 1 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR and 1 mmol/L PBA as low-dose
regimens and 3 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR and 3 mmol/L PBA as high-dose
regimens for our experiments.

Effects of DNMT and HDAC inhibition on growth of T24
cells. Inhibitors of HDACs and DNMTs are potent cell cycle
inhibitors and inducers of apoptosis (8, 9). We first investigated the
effects of high and low doses of 24 h of exposure to 5-aza-CdR
followed by continuous PBA treatment on T24 bladder cancer cells
on a long-term basis. Treatment with low doses of 5-aza-CdR or
PBA by themselves resulted in minor effects on cell population
doublings, whereas a more pronounced decrease of cell numbers
was observed when 5-aza-CdR and PBA were used sequentially
(Fig. 2A). For high-dose experiments, 3 mmol/L PBA and 3 Amol/L
5-aza-CdR showed remarkable inhibitions of proliferation in single
treatments. Combination treatment with high doses of both drugs
reduced cell counts to a great extent, such that the experiment
could not be continued after day 6 (Fig. 2B). Previous studies have
used sequential scheduling for combination treatments (8, 9, 21).
We also used concurrent administration but did not observe differences in the effects on proliferation or apoptosis (data not shown).
Effects of combination treatment on cell cycle distribution
and viability of T24 cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analyses and apoptotic assays were done to test whether
the reduction in cell numbers was due to reduced cell proliferation
or increased cell death (Fig. 3). Low or high doses of 5-aza-CdR had
little effects on the overall cell cycle distribution; only a slight
broadening of the G1 peak was observed. Single treatment with
PBA led to a dose-dependent reduction of S and G2-M phase cells.
Low doses of combination treatment had little effect on the overall

FACS profile, whereas high doses of both PBA and 5-aza-CdR
together showed a loss of S and G2-M phase cells and a substantial
fraction of cells at the sub-G1 level, indicating that high doses of
the drugs impaired proper cell cycle regulation (Fig. 3A). Combined Annexin V and propidium iodide staining was done to test
whether the increased sub-G1 fraction in the high-dose combination-treated population represented apoptotic cells (Fig. 3B).
Control cells and cells treated with 3 mmol/L PBA only showed
similar distributions within the bottom left quadrant of the
diagram, representing viable cells, with f10% apoptotic cells,
most probably caused by trypsinization of cells before staining.
High doses of 5-aza-CdR caused a slight shift of cells to the bottom
right quadrant, representing apoptotic cells. However, the highdose PBA plus 5-aza-CdR treatment resulted in f50% of the cell
population appearing in the top right quadrant, representing late
apoptotic and necrotic cells. Therefore, high doses of combination

freshly every day. Cells were counted every 6 d and reseeded at the initial

Combination Effects of 5-Aza-CdR and PBA

than basal expression levels in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 4B). Taken
together, our results suggest that both normal and cancer cell lines
respond to 5-aza-CdR and PBA treatment by up-regulation of the
cell cycle inhibitors p16 and p21 in both DNA methylationdependent and DNA methylation-independent fashion. Normal
cells generally seem to be less affected by epigenetic drugs (22–24),
most likely because of their reduced proliferation rates compared
with cancer cells. However, the drug combination we used seemed
to be equal or even more potent in inducing cell cycle inhibition in
normal fibroblasts, which might have implications for therapy.
Changes in chromatin modifications. To determine covalent
chromatin changes after treatments at the p16 and p21 loci, we did
ChIP analyses with antibodies against acetylated histone H3, a
marker for active chromatin (Fig. 5). LD419 normal fibroblasts,
which have an unmethylated p16 promoter (22), showed basal
levels of acetylated H3 in untreated and PBA- or 5-aza-CdR only–
treated cells at the p16 locus, with slightly elevated levels
surrounding the transcription start site. After combination
treatment, we detected an increase in H3 acetylation spanning
the whole p16 locus, which was especially high around the
transcription start site and indicative of activation (Fig. 5A, top).
In contrast, we could not detect H3 acetylation at the p16 locus
in untreated or PBA only–treated T24 cells, which did not express
p16. After 5-aza-CdR or combination treatment, an increase in H3
acetylation was apparent with a prominent peak after the
transcription start site, similar to what we observed in LD419
cells (Fig. 5A, bottom). Therefore, the levels of p16 expression
correlated with the amount of H3 acetylation present at the
transcription start site in both normal fibroblasts and cancer cells.
Comparing the levels of the repressive histone mark H3K9
trimethyl (H3K9trim), we found that the transcription start site in
nonexpressing T24 cells was associated with higher levels of this
modification than LD419 cells (Fig. 5B). Intriguingly, the methylation mark was not lost or decreased after drug treatment and
induction of p16 but was maintained at similar or slightly higher
levels in T24 cells, indicating that the repressive histone
conformation cannot be completely reversed after drug treatments.
The cell cycle inhibitor p21 can be induced in a p53-dependent
or p53-independent manner following treatment with several
HDAC inhibitors (25) and by 5-aza-CdR treatment (26, 27). ChIP
assays upstream and downstream of the p21 transcription start site
showed high levels of histone H3 acetylation downstream of the
transcription start site in untreated LD419 and T24 cells, which
increased slightly on 5-aza-CdR and/or PBA treatment (Fig. 5C).
Although we had observed significant differences in the expression
levels of p21 in normal fibroblast and cancer cell lines, with a much
higher induction level in normal cells (Fig. 4B), we could not detect
drastic differences in histone H3 acetylation at the p21 locus
between LD419 and T24 cells. Furthermore, we did not find any
remarkable levels of H3K9trim at the four regions analyzed in
neither cell line before or after treatments (data not shown).
In summary, we detected changes in acetylated histone H3 after
5-aza-CdR and/or PBA treatment, which were more obvious at the
p16 locus after combination treatment and less apparent in the
p21 regions tested and were similar in normal and tumor cells.
Interestingly, H3K9trim, which was higher in cancer cells, was not
altered by the various treatments.
Long-term effects of the combination treatment. A major
caveat of 5-aza-CdR treatment is the remethylation and resilencing
of genes, such as p16, after several rounds of DNA replication (16).
Because HDACs and DNMTs work together in the same complexes

treatment were synergistic in inducing apoptosis, as observed
previously (9), probably due to a global epigenetic destabilization of
chromatin.
Effects of combination treatment on the expression of cell
cycle regulators. The cell cycle inhibitors p16 and p21 are two
well-characterized targets of DNMT and/or HDAC inhibitors
(15, 16). We analyzed the expression of these genes by quantitative
real-time RT-PCR in a set of normal fibroblast and cancer cell lines
untreated or treated with low- and high-dose combinations of
5-aza-CdR and PBA to determine the generality of the findings
(Fig. 4). All four fibroblast cell lines examined have an unmethylated p16 promoter (22) and showed basal levels of p16 expression
in untreated cells, which were induced in all cases by low- and
high-dose combinations of 5-aza-CdR and PBA. In cancer cell lines,
p16 was silenced by DNA methylation, except for NCCIT cells
(ref. 22; data not shown), and expressed at very low levels but
induced after combination treatment to levels comparable with
wild-type cell lines and mostly in a dose-dependent fashion
(Fig. 4A). On the other hand, p21 expression and induction was
markedly different in normal and tumor cell lines. Normal cells
expressed higher basal levels of p21, which was up-regulated to a
greater extent after combination treatment when compared with
cancer cell lines. The extent of p21 expression after high-dose
combination treatment in cancer cells was in most cases lower

did not change the methylation level of p16 exon 1, whereas 24 h of
exposure to 5-aza-CdR reduced the methylation to f50% (Fig. 6A).
No difference in the rate of remethylation was observed between
cells treated with 5-aza-CdR only and those subsequently exposed
to PBA. The reacquisition of DNA methylation is accompanied by
resilencing of the p16 gene (Fig. 6B). Low doses of 5-aza-CdR or

5-aza-CdR treatment would inhibit or retard this remethylation,
thereby prolonging the expression of aberrantly silenced genes
(Fig. 6). We chose low doses of both regimens for this experiment
to keep cells proliferating at similar levels as untreated cells,
thereby avoiding potential artifacts. Treatment of cells with PBA

Combination Effects of 5-Aza-CdR and PBA

24 h and 3 mmol/L PBA continuous), which was clearly due to the
significant apoptosis caused by the drug combination. This
occurred within 6 days of treatment, after which very few cells
survived. 5-Aza-CdR is a nucleoside analogue, which at high doses
causes DNA damage and inhibits chromosome condensation
resulting in cytotoxicity (29). It is a potent inducer of heterochromatin decondensation, which can lead to complex alterations in
chromosome compaction during mitosis resulting in chromosome
instability (30–32). The HDAC inhibitor could contribute to this
process by causing the decondensation of chromatin, thereby
increasing genomic instability. It has been shown that, in the
presence of TSA, cells enter mitosis with hyperacetylated histones,
which is associated with marked decondensation of the chromosomes and with segregation defects leading to aneuploidy and
defects in chromosome structure (33, 34). Likewise, suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid induced polyploidy and senescence in colon and
breast cancer cell lines (35). Therefore, high-dose combination of
PBA and 5-aza-CdR might induce an ‘‘epigenetic catastrophe’’ by
greatly changing chromosome architecture, which will not allow
for controlled DNA replication or mitosis and finally initiate
apoptosis. Several different apoptotic pathways have been associated with cell death after HDAC inhibitor treatments, such as
caspase-dependent or caspase-independent mechanisms or the
tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand and FAS
pathways (36).

5-aza-CdR plus PBA induced the expression of p16 to maximal
levels between days 3 and 6 of treatment. Thereafter, the expression
decreased and was almost completely silenced between days 25
and 35 of treatment. Interestingly, the combination-treated cells
maintained higher levels of p16 expression throughout the
experiment, although the expression was silenced with comparable
kinetics to the 5-aza-CdR-treated cells. We next analyzed the active
chromatin marks at the p16 promoter after 31 days of treatments,
at the time of p16 resilencing. The peak of histone H3 acetylation,
which we observed on day 5 after treatment at the transcription
start site (Fig. 5A), was completely ablated after long-term
treatment and had returned to the levels of untreated or PBAtreated cells (Fig. 6C). This loss of acetylation was specific for the
p16 locus because global histone H4 acetylation levels were still
higher in PBA- or combination-treated cells (Fig. 6D). Therefore,
DNA methylation seems to be the stronger epigenetic mark not
only in terms of reexpression of genes after treatment with
different drugs (8) but also in setting up the repressive state.

Discussion
DNMT inhibitors, such as 5-aza-CdR, and HDAC inhibitors, such
as PBA, are synergistic in their antitumorigenic effects (3).
In the current study, we observed a major decrease in cell growth
in T24 cells in the high-dose group (3 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR for

saw an even higher induction of p21 in normal compared with
cancer cell lines. Our ChIP experiments showed only minor
changes in chromatin modifications before and after treatment
at the p21 locus. This may suggest that the p21 promoter is already
poised for activation in the cell lines tested and that the effects on
transcription are primarily indirect and through activation of
different transcription factors and not by effects on chromatin
structure at the p21 promoter.
Given the fact that HDACs are found in the same complexes with
DNMTs (28), we hypothesized that the inhibition of HDAC activity
by PBA would prevent the remethylation of the p16 promoter,
which is known to occur gradually after withdrawal of 5-aza-CdR
(16). However, this was not the case, and addition of PBApretreated cells to 5-aza-CdR-pretreated cells did not inhibit or
retard the DNA remethylation seen in 5-aza-CdR only–treated cells.
This confirms again the stronger effect of DNA methylation on
gene silencing in both initiating and maintaining stable epigenetic
changes. Therefore, only a complete reversal from the ‘‘malignant’’
to a ‘‘normal’’ chromatin state might be effective in stably reversing
epigenetic silencing.
Two aspects of our work are of special clinical relevance. First,
we found that normal fibroblasts are also affected by the
combination drug treatment and show up-regulation of the cell
cycle regulators p16 and p21. Therefore, it will be of importance to
investigate more normal tissues, in particular proliferating ones,
which are predicted to uptake more of the drugs and be more
sensitive to treatments. Second, long-term treatments with PBA
could not inhibit DNA remethylation and reversal of repressive
chromatin at the p16 locus. This problem might be circumvented
by a prolonged treatment with less cytotoxic DNMT inhibitors,
such as zebularine (44), which might be more potent in stably
reverting tumor cells to a more normal epigenetic profile.

Low doses of the drugs caused a decrease in population doublings, which was maintained during long-term culture. Because we
do not observe an increase in apoptosis in the cells treated in this
manner, this is more likely to be a consequence of reexpression
of genes involved in tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation,
such as p16 and p21. We observed an increase in the expression
of p16 with both agents, as has been reported previously with
the combination of HDAC inhibitors and 5-aza-CdR (8, 37).
Interestingly, both normal and cancer cells showed very similar
induction levels after combination treatment. In most of the cancer
cell lines, p16 is silent because of DNA hypermethylation, whereas
normal cells express basal levels of p16 and are unmethylated (22).
Intriguingly, the combination treatments led to a very distinct
peak of histone H3 acetylation around the transcription start
sites in both normal and cancer cells (Fig. 5). Interestingly, treatment with 5-aza-CdR only also induced elevated levels of H3
acetylation at the p16 start sites in both cell lines, which was not
due to an increase in global histone acetylation in T24 cells.
Therefore, the induction of the p16 gene was well reflected in
changes in active chromatin modifications at the p16 start sites,
which suggests that the induction of p16 was caused by direct
effects of 5-aza-CdR and PBA on chromatin structure in normal
fibroblasts and cancer cells.
It has been shown before that dimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9dim)
is decreased after 5-aza-CdR treatment at various promoters
(38, 39). H3K9trim can be seen as a stronger repressive mark than
H3K9dim, and it is more defined and usually associated with
heterochromatic regions and gene silencing. Therefore, the
association of H3K9trim spanning the p16 region even after drug
treatments in T24 cells was a very interesting although unexpected
observation. This has also been observed recently in HCT116 colon
cancer cells, where DNA demethylation by 5-aza-CdR did not cause
a loss of H3K9trim or H3K27 methylation at several promoters of
tumor suppressor genes (40). Therefore, the remaining of H3K9trim
at the promoter might attract DNA methylation and cause
remethylation of p16 in T24 cells.
Although some authors have reported that the p21 promoter
can be methylated (41–43), we did not find this to be the case in
T24 bladder cancer cells or LD419 normal fibroblasts. In fact, we
