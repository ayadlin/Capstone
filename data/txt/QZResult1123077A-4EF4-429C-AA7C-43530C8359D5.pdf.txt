ABSTRACT
We developed a series of models to predict the likelihood of recurrence and the
response to chemotherapy for the personalized treatment of stage I and II colorectal
cancer patients. A recurrence prediction model was developed from 235 stage I/II
patients. The model successfully distinguished between high-risk and low-risk
groups, with a hazard ratio of recurrence of 4.66 (p < 0.0001). More importantly,
the model was accurate for both stage I (hazard ratio = 5.87, p = 0.0006) and stage
II (hazard ratio = 4.30, p < 0.0001) disease. This model performed much better than
the Oncotype and ColoPrint commercial services in identifying patients at high risk for
stage II recurrence. And unlike the commercial services, the robust model included
recurrence prediction for stage I patients. As stage I/II CRC patients usually do not
receive chemotherapy, we generated chemotherapy efficacy prediction models with
data from 358 stage III patients. The predictions were highly accurate: the hazard
ratio of recurrence for responders vs. non-responders was 4.13 for those treated
with FOLFOX (p < 0.0001), and 3.16 (p = 0.0012) for those treated with fluorouracil.
We have thus created a prognostic model that accurately identifies patients at high
risk for recurrence, and the first accurate chemotherapy efficacy prediction model for
individual patients. In the future, complete personalized treatment plans for stage
I/II patients may be developed if the drug prediction models generated from stage III
patients are verified to be effective for stage I and II patients in prospective studies.

INTRODUCTION

For early-stage cancer patients who receive curative
resection, the identification of their risk for recurrence (and
thus the potential benefit of adjuvant therapy) could improve
long-term outcomes. Both prognostic models that identify
high-risk patients and chemotherapy efficacy prediction
models that determine the efficacy of adjuvant treatments
are necessary for building personalized treatment plans.
Currently, adjuvant therapy is standard care for
patients with stage III CRC with survival benefit [4]. The
role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I patients remains

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes
of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Currently, the
prognosis for CRC patients is determined by pathological
features and the stage of the tumor at diagnosis. Patients
with American Joint Committee on Cancer defined stage I
and II disease have up to a 30% chance of recurrence after
surgical resection, whereas patients with stage III disease
have a 50-60% chance of recurrence within five years [1–3].

controversial, as most patients have good prognoses [5]
and the few high-risk patients are difficult to identify.
Much effort has been made to identify high-risk stage II
patients who might benefit from adjuvant therapy. The
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline has
identified several factors that predict poor prognosis,
including emergency presentation (tumor obstruction,
perforation), an inadequate number of assessed lymph
nodes (< 12), T4 tumors, poor histological differentiation,
lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and the
presence of positive resection margins. However, these
clinicopathologic factors alone have not been effective
in identifying high-risk stage II patients. High-risk
patients identified by the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network guideline received no benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapeutic treatment [6–8], and low-risk patients
incurred the additional risk of worse disease-free survival
(DFS) [6]. Some studies on clinicopathologic variables
have indicated that only a subset of factors, such as T4
status and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels,
effectively identified high-risk patients [9–11]. Adding
DNA mismatch repair status to clinicopathologic variables
has also been reported to improve prognostic predictions
for stage II patients [12, 13].
Due to the limitations of clinicopathologic variables
for prognostic prediction, genomic information has been
increasingly used to determine the risk of recurrence
[14–29]. Nevertheless, several comprehensive reviews have
concluded that genomic predictions are only “marginally”
better than clinicopathologic variables in predicting the
prognosis for stage II CRC patients [12, 17, 30–32].
Chemotherapy efficacy prediction analysis is an
important complement to prognostic analysis. For stage
I and II high-risk CRC patients identified by prognostic
analysis, chemotherapy efficacy prediction analysis can
inform the selection of an effective adjuvant treatment
[12]. Among stage III patients, about 40% will experience
recurrence even after adjuvant treatment [33]; thus,
chemotherapy efficacy predictions would help stage III
patients weigh the benefits of treatment against potential
adverse effects.
For early-stage colon cancer patients, the most
commonly used adjuvant treatments are 5FU (5-fluorouracil
and leucovorin) and FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin,
and oxaliplatin). Many population-based studies have been
performed [33–37] to compare the efficacy of 5FU and
FOLFOX in patients of different ages and disease stages,
examine the adverse effects of treatment in elderly or stage
II patients, and evaluate the adverse effects [38] and cost
effectiveness of adding Oxaliplatin [39, 40]. Many of these
reports were based on two large clinical trials (MOSAIC
and NSABP C-07).
On the other hand, there have been limited results
from genomic studies addressing the issues raised by
the population-based studies [41–45]. In almost all 5FU
and FOLFOX efficacy studies, individual marker genes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have been used to predict the effectiveness of the drug
regimens. The goal of these studies was to validate the
target gene functions, rather than to identify global
gene signatures that would best distinguish treatment
responders from non-responders. Microsatellite instability
(MSI) is a successful marker that has been confirmed as
a prognostic indicator, but not as a chemotherapy efficacy
prediction indicator [13, 4]. Studies combining markers
for the prediction of 5FU efficacy are still in their early
stages [41, 42]; therefore, no markers are currently being
used to predict drug efficacy in the clinic [46, 47].
In addition, many studies have been designed for
stage IV patients, such that drug efficacy has been defined
by a reduction in tumor size. However, in early-stage CRC
patients, efficacy is better defined by recurrence after
curative resection. In this study, recurrence will be used
for the determination of efficacy for stage I and II patients.
In most published prognostic CRC studies, stage II
patients have been evaluated; stage III patients have been
included in some studies, but stage I patients have only
been assessed in one publication, with a very small sample
size of 15 [26]. The focus on stage II cancer patients is
understandable, as such patients would be more likely
to benefit from treatment, and would be easier to study
than stage I patients. Prediction models are often effective
for patients at one stage, but not for another. Predicting
recurrence for early-stage patients requires excellent
sensitivity so that rare recurrence cases can be detected,
whereas predicting recurrence for later stage patients
requires better specificity so that patients do not undergo
unnecessary adjuvant treatment. Since adjuvant therapy
is already recommended for patients with stage III CRC,
the goal of the present recurrence study was to develop a
robust prognostic model for stage I and II patients. We also
developed the first chemotherapeutic efficacy prediction
models for 5FU and FOLFOX. The goal was not only to
predict the efficacy of 5FU and FOLFOX independently,
but also to generate consistent predictions from these two
models so that a rational choice could be made between
the two treatment options.

RESULTS
Recurrence prediction
Clinical data
One hundred fifty-seven samples were used as a
training set to generate a prognostic prediction model.
An additional 78 samples were used as a blind test set
to validate the prediction model. Patients with positive
resection margins were excluded from this study. Only
four of the total 235 stage I/II CRC patients had T4 status.

Univariate analyses of all training and test samples
revealed that recurrence was associated with pre-operative
CEA values, emergent operations, mucinous components,

group vs. the low-risk group was 5.61 (95% CI: 2.33 to
13.54, P = 0.0001; Figure 1B).

Blind validation results
To confirm the performance of the prediction model,
we used 78 additional samples (from 33 recurrent and 45
non-recurrent CRC patients) as a true blind test in which
the recurrence status was not known at the prediction. The
HR of recurrence in the high-risk group vs. the low-risk
group in this blind test set was 2.44 (95% CI: 1.13 to 5.29,
P = 0.0235; Figure 1C). In terms of overall survival, the
HR in the high-risk group vs. the low-risk group was 4.68
(95% CI: 1.17 to 18.70, P = 0.0293; Figure 1D). These
results confirmed the effectiveness of the recurrence
prediction model.

Training set results
The training set consisted of 157 samples from 64
recurrent CRC patients and 93 non-recurrent patients.
During the training, samples were randomly divided
into two groups: 150 samples were used to generate the
prediction model, and seven samples were used to test the
performance of the model generated from the 150 samples
by the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method, as described
in the Materials and Methods. Although the recurrence
information of the seven test samples was known, the
computer program was carefully designed to avoid using
the recurrence information to generate the model. The
training model was able to separate recurrent from nonrecurrent patients effectively. The hazard ratio (HR) of
recurrence in the high-risk group vs. the low-risk group
was 2.90 (95% CI: 1.69 to 4.98 P = 0.0001; Figure 1A). In
addition, in terms of overall survival, the HR in the high-risk

Final recurrence prediction results
The consistency of the validation and training results
demonstrated that the prediction model was robust and
unbiased. To better characterize the recurrence prediction
model, we studied all 235 samples (the original 157 training
samples and the 78 testing samples) together, and used a
leave-five-out method to characterize the final prediction
performance. The HR of recurrence in the high-risk

The performance reported above was based on a
235-sample set that included both stage I and stage II
CRC patients. To evaluate the prediction performance for
stage I or stage II patients separately, we segregated and
re-examined the samples. The HR of recurrence in stage
I patients was 5.87 (95% CI: 2.99 to 53.51, P = 0.0006;
Figure 2C), and in stage II patients was 4.30 (95% CI: 2.15
to 5.39, P < 0.0001; Figure 2D). Figure 2 displays the
similar long-term recurrence rates for stage I and II patients,
demonstrating the robustness of the prediction model.
This recurrence prediction model also performed
well for all three types of CRC. The HR of recurrence
was 6.81 (95% CI: 2.34 to 10.78, P < 0.0001) in patients
with right-sided colon cancer, 4.51 (95% CI: 1.97 to 7.81,
P < 0.0001) in patients with left-sided colon cancer, and
3.27 (95% CI: 1.43 to 6.79, P = 0.0042) in patients with
rectal cancer.
Currently, there are two commercial services for stage
II colon cancer recurrence prediction. ColoPrint obtained
a five-year DFS difference of about 14% and a HR of
recurrence of 2.65 between high-risk and low-risk patients
using fresh frozen tissue [15]. Oncotype determined a HR of
1.43 for a recurrence score difference of 25 using formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue; the maximum

three-year DFS difference was 14% between patients with
the highest and lowest recurrence scores [14]. The actual
DFS difference will be lower, and depends on the cutoff
between high-risk and low-risk patients. In contrast, in this
study, much better results were achieved with FFPE tissue.
The HR of recurrence in high-risk patients vs. low-risk
patients was 4.66 (Table 1), the five-year DFS difference
between high-risk and low-risk patients was 46%, and the
three-year DFS difference was 40% (Figure 2A). Thus, the
DFS difference in this study was about three times greater
than those of the previous studies.

Biomarker comparison among different studies
We compared the genes selected for our recurrence
prediction model (Supplementary Table 3) with those
selected by the two commercial services, Oncotype
and ColoPrint. While Oncotype used seven genes and
ColoPrint used 18 genes (listed in the Materials and
Methods section), we used 120 genes to generate our
recurrence prediction model. Among these three gene
signatures, there was only one common gene, BGN, which
was selected by both Oncotype and us. The remaining
genes from these three biomarker panels were all different.

Figure 2: The final performance of the recurrence prediction model including all stage I and II samples is shown in (A) and
(B). The performances with separated stage I and II samples are shown in (C) and (D). Patients in stages I and II had similar long-term
DFS rates.

confidence responders and non-responders to 5FU would
be treated with FOLFOX.

In total, 192 stage III CRC patients treated with 5FU
were used for the efficacy study, of whom 119 did not
experience recurrence during the follow-up period. Another
set of 166 stage III patients treated with FOLFOX were
used for the efficacy study, of whom 102 did not experience
recurrence during the follow-up period. The efficacy of
each drug was defined by the patients’ recurrence status.
Responders were patients who had no recurrence for at
least 48 months after the surgery, while non-responders
were patients who experienced recurrence during the
follow-up. Supplementary Table 2 lists the demographics
of the patients in the chemotherapy study.
The training for these two drugs followed the twostage procedure described above for the recurrence study.
In the first stage, about one-third of the patients were
reserved as the blind test set, and the remaining two-thirds
were used as the training set. The training set was used to
generate a prediction model, and the test set was used to
validate the prediction model. The final performances of the
prediction models were then determined with the use of all
samples from both data sets and the leave-five-out iteration
method during the second stage. The 5FU (Figure 3A) and
FOLFOX (Figure 3B) prediction models both performed
well, with excellent performance indicators (Table 2).
The sensitivity of the drug efficacy models was
defined as the ability to detect patients who would benefit
from adjuvant treatment (i.e., no recurrence after adjuvant
treatment), in contrast to the first part of the study, where
sensitivity was defined as the ability to detect patients
who would relapse, so they could be targeted for adjuvant
treatment. When the default cutoff of zero was used, the
FOLFOX model had a sensitivity of 0.88 and a specificity
of 0.47, while the 5FU model had a sensitivity of 0.76 and
a specificity of 0.59 (Table 2).
For the purpose of choosing between FOLFOX or
5FU for adjuvant treatment, it will be necessary to have
high specificity for the 5FU prediction and high sensitivity
for the FOLFOX prediction. The default cutoff yielded a
high sensitivity of 0.88 for FOLFOX prediction, whereas a
cutoff score of -1.1 achieved a high specificity of 0.86 for
5FU prediction. With these cutoffs, only high-confidence
5FU responders would be treated with 5FU, while lowerwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DISCUSSION
Stage I and II CRC patients were chosen for the
prognostic study
In published studies, it has been common for
prediction models to perform differently for different
stages of disease. The recurrence rate in stage I CRC
patients is the lowest, and is the most difficult to predict
accurately. In creating this prognostic prediction model,
our objective was to achieve good performance for both
stage I and II patients. Thus, samples from stage I and II
patients were chosen for training and for determining the
gene expression separation boundaries between high-risk
and low-risk patients. Our results demonstrated that the
model using targeted stage samples performed better than
using non-targeted stage samples.
Some studies used samples from non-targeted
stage I and IV patients (who exhibit a clean separation)
to distinguish between targeted high-risk and low-risk
stage II and III patients [20, 23, 27]. By this design,
the true boundary between recurrent and non-recurrent
patients could not be determined in these studies, since
targeted stage II and III patients were not included in the
training. This could explain the contradictory conclusions
of different studies in which this approach was used; for
instance, one model predicted recurrence for stage III
patients but not for stage II patients [20], while another
model predicted recurrence for stage II patients but not for
stage III patients [27]. In a third study, recurrence could
be predicted for both stage II and III patients; however,
the results were obtained from two different platforms, so
further validation of the models was needed [23] .

Binary training
In many gene studies, three classifications have
been used for patients: high-risk, intermediate-risk, and
low-risk. Since an intermediate-risk classification does
not allow a clinician to make a clear treatment decision, a
binary high-risk and low-risk classification separation was
13810

Oncotarget

chosen for this study. The binary training process forces the
prediction model to learn the gene expression separation
boundaries between two classifications of samples. A
binary-decision-based prediction model still allows lowconfidence high-risk and low-risk patients to be reclassified
as intermediate-risk after the training prediction model is
made. Such reclassification would yield a much smaller
intermediate-risk population than training without the
constraint of forced binary classification.

clinicopathologic variables seems contrary to the basic
notion of using genomic information for prediction.
Conceptually, for a gene-based prognostic analysis
to be robust, the relevant gene information related to
clinicopathologic variables should be extracted to ensure
that the prediction does not require information from
clinical variables to be added externally.
The heterogeneity of cancer could be one factor that
has limited the performance of studies in which smaller
numbers of biomarkers were used. Marisa et al. [28] found
a relationship between heterogeneity and recurrence when
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression
data was used to identify six molecular subtypes. Different
subtypes were independently associated with different
relapse-free survival times after adjustment for age, sex, and
stage. Shibayama et al. reviewed all published prognostic
models and found that there was little overlap among the
gene lists. The authors cited the tumor heterogeneity of
CRC as one of the reasons for this lack of overlap [30].
To overcome this heterogeneity issue, we chose to use
microarrays so that a larger number of genes could be
included in the models. In addition, the large number of
genes detected by the microarray (most of which were not

Larger numbers of genes are needed for
heterogeneous CRC
Many prognostic recurrence studies have included
a small number of biomarkers, such as gene [19, 25, 26],
microRNA [18], or protein expression markers [21], and
have had limited success. In fact, when published gene
or protein markers were retested in a separate study,
these markers failed to predict recurrence [21]. Due to
the limited performance of prediction models, some
investigators have added clinicopathologic variables
to gene-based prediction models to enhance the overall
system performance [48, 49]. However, the addition of

calibrating the relevant genes used for prediction.

intermediate-risk patients, the HR values would be higher.
This HR value allows better identification of high-risk
patients than those of the existing models. The five-year
DFS difference between high-risk and low-risk patients
was 46% (Figure 2A), about three times higher the DFS
differences of Oncotype and ColoPrint.

Different gene lists among studies
The genes selected for our recurrence prediction
model were very different from those selected by
Oncotype and ColoPrint. When we tested our samples
for each of the 18 ColoPrint genes, we were not able to
distinguish between recurrent and non-recurrent samples,
most likely because of the different platforms and sample
types used (PCR and fresh-frozen samples for ColoPrint
vs. microarray and FFPE in this study). On the other hand,
Oncotype used PCR, as ColoPrint did, but used FFPE
samples for training, as we did in this study. In addition
to BGN, Oncotype genes MK167 and MYBL2 could
also be used to distinguish between recurrent and nonrecurrent samples in our dataset; however, their prediction
performances were inferior to those of the other genes
selected in our final model.
This issue of divergent gene lists generated from
different platforms was previously examined by the FDA’s
Microarray Quality Control workshop. The disparity was
found to be due to the different probes and labels used
by each platform [50]. Tan et al. demonstrated that even
when the same RNA samples were tested on three different
commercial platforms, the resultant differentially expressed
gene panels were very different [51]. The number of
differentially expressed genes identified ranged from 34 to
113, and only four genes were commonly selected across
all three platforms. Therefore, it is not surprising that the
biomarker panels generated by ColoPrint, Oncotype, and
our study were so disparate, as they were generated with
different platforms and types of samples.

Results of chemotherapy efficacy prediction
The second part of this study addressed the problem
of selecting the most effective adjuvant chemotherapeutic
regimen. Currently, the efficacy of some chemotherapy
drugs can be predicted by one or two markers; for instance,
the efficacy of Cetuximab is predicted by KRAS/BRAF
expression [52]. This approach is possible when the
pathway information of a drug is known; however, this is
not true for many drugs, especially cytotoxic therapeutics.
At present, combination drug treatments including cytotoxic
compounds are commonly used, and their efficacies depend
on many factors and cellular pathways [47]. Even when
the mechanism is understood, the prediction of efficacy is
limited by knowledge of the specific pathway. For example,
KRAS and BRAF are negative predictors (i.e., of who will
not benefit from Cetuximab), but do not provide positive
predictions of who will benefit from Cetuximab as part of a
combination therapy. On the other hand, a whole-genomebased analysis can extract information from many unknown
pathways in the training process. Pathway analysis is
critical for new scientific discoveries, but is not as efficient
as whole-genome analysis in capturing discriminate factors
for phenotype classification.
In addition, chemotherapy efficacy prediction is more
than just the ability to predict the efficacy of an individual
drug. A critical component of treatment determinations is
the ability to compare several drug efficacy predictions
before selecting the optimal plan. In general, different
prediction models are trained independently, and each
model retains the characteristics of the training process.
Since the conditions of each training are different, it is very
difficult if not impossible to compare results from different
models. We avoided this issue by constraining the training
process to produce a pair of consistent 5FU and FOLFOX
prediction models.
The efficacy of our chemotherapeutic prediction
model is the best demonstration of the capability of full
genomic analysis, especially for the complex combination
drug regimen of FOLFOX. With the success of our
chemotherapy efficacy prediction model, there is now a
path toward developing a complete set of prediction models
for early-stage CRC patients. Our prognostic prediction
model can be used to select high-risk patients for adjuvant
treatment, and the two chemotherapy prediction models
can be used to select the proper adjuvant treatment and
thus form a truly personalized treatment plan.
It should be noted that the chemotherapeutic
efficacy model was developed with stage III CRC patients,

Results of recurrence prediction
The present method of genomic study allowed us
to generate a much-improved recurrence prediction model
for all three types of CRC: right-sided colon cancer, leftsided colon cancer and rectal cancer. More importantly,
the model was effective not only for stage II patients, but
also for the more statistically challenging stage I patients.
The consistency of performance for stage I and II patients
over the three types of CRC indicated the robustness of
this prediction model, and was an important improvement
over other published results and the commercial services
of Oncotype and ColoPrint.
The performance of our model was best represented
by the high area under the curve of 0.77 for the Receiver
Operating Characteristic curve. At the default cutoff value
of 0, the sensitivity was 0.80, and the HR of recurrence in
high-risk vs. low-risk CRC patients was 4.74. An important
point is that the current results were generated by a forced
binary decision approach. If the marginal patients between
high-risk and low-risk patients were reclassified as

since few stage I/II patients receive chemotherapy. If the
drug prediction models generated from stage III patients
are verified to be effective for stage I and II patients in
prospective studies, we will have a set of predictions that
can be used to form complete personalized treatment
plans for early-stage CRC patients. For patients with
more advanced stages of CRC, this approach can be used
to evaluate additional chemotherapies in the future.

Written informed consents for tissue collection
were obtained from all patients. FFPE tissue blocks were
retrieved from the Biobank of Taipei Veterans General
Hospital. For each patient, the most representative part of
the tumor, usually the solid part next to the center of the
tumor with no necrotic tissue, was prospectively collected,
processed, and stored in the Biobank of Taipei Veterans
General Hospital. Samples were examined by an expert
pathologist (TY Chou), who determined the percentage of
tumor cells; only samples with > 40% tumor cells were
included in this study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Platform

This study, conducted at Taipei Veterans General
Hospital, conformed to the guidelines of the ethics
committee, and was approved by the Internal Review
Board (VGHIRB Number: 2013-06-005AC). In total,
593 patients with pathological stage I – III CRC who had
undergone R0 curative resection between March 2003 and
November 2010 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were
enrolled. Clinical information was prospectively obtained
and recorded in a computerized database, including patient
demographics (age, gender, and comorbidities), tumor
characteristics (location, TNM stage, differentiation, and
prognostic features), and follow-up data. After surgery,
patients were examined at an outpatient department every
three months for the first two years, every six months
for the third and fourth years, and annually thereafter.
Follow-up examinations included serum CEA and CA199 level measurements, chest radiography, and abdominal
ultrasonography. Abdominal/pelvic with- or withoutchest computed tomography was performed annually
and whenever recurrence was suspected. Colonoscopy
was performed one year after surgery and every two to
three years thereafter. If cecal intubation was not achieved
preoperatively, a colonoscopy was performed three to six
months after operation.
In total, 235 patients with pathological early-stage
(I and II) CRC who had undergone complete resection
were included in the recurrence study. None of them
received neoadjuvant treatment. Two hundred and ten
of them did not receive adjuvant treatment after surgery,
while 25 received adjuvant treatment but experienced
recurrence during follow-up. Stage III CRC patients
who had received adjuvant treatment were used for the
chemotherapy efficacy studies; 192 patients received 5FU
and 166 patients received FOLFOX.
Most early-stage CRC patients will not experience
recurrence; thus, a prediction model developed with the
data from all available patients will perform well for nonrecurrent patients but poorly for recurrent patients, due
to the sampling bias introduced by the uneven numbers
of non-recurrent and recurrent samples. In the current
study, we selected comparable numbers of recurrent and
non-recurrent patients to ensure that the prediction model
developed would perform similarly for both groups.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We analyzed samples with the GeneChip® Human
ST 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) ,
a whole-transcript array that includes probes to measure
30,654 mRNA and 11,086 long intergenic non-coding
RNA (lincRNA) transcripts. The complete dataset
(GSE81653) can be accessed at the NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus.

Data generation
Total RNA was extracted from 10-um FFPE tissue
sections by means of QIAsymphony RNA kits. All tissue
samples had the minimum 40% tumor cell percentage.
RNA 6000 Nano kits (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
were used to check the quality of the total RNA. The RNA
quality was safeguarded with a cutoff value zero of delta
Ct against 18S with qPCR. The Ovation Pico WTA System
(Nugen, San Carlos, CA, USA) was used to amplify
cDNA from total RNA. MinElute Reaction CleanUP
Kits (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) were used for
purification, while the Encore Biotin Module (Nugen) was
used for fragmentation and labeling. The fragmented, endlabeled cDNA samples were applied to the Affymetrix 2.0
ST arrays. The arrays were washed and stained with the
GeneChip Fluidics Station 450.

Data analysis
Gene expression data were extracted from the
Affymetrix CEL data file and normalized with the vendor’s
robust multi-array average (RMA) software. The quality
of labeling and hybridization was monitored with vendorspecified spikes. Their values and the values of additional
quality controls provided by the vendor’s Expression
Console were within the specifications, ensuring the
quality of the sample processing and gene expression data.
A supervised clustering method of KNN was used to
analyze the gene expression data and generate a prediction
model. Unknown samples were categorized as high-risk
or low-risk depending on the classification of the KNN.
The distance used to measure the closeness between
samples was the correlation of their mRNA levels. A t-test
was used to select the top 500 genes that best separated
13813

high-risk and low-risk samples. The final genes chosen for
prediction (Supplementary Table 3) and the optimal values
of K (1-3) of KNN for the prediction were determined by
20-fold training and testing iterations among samples.
For each sample, the prediction model yielded a
prediction score based on a particular cutoff value for a
binary high-risk vs. low-risk decision. The positive or
negative sign of the score indicated a high-risk or lowrisk prediction, respectively. A larger absolute value (e.g.,
score > 0.5 or score < –0.5) of the score indicated a greater
confidence in the prediction, while a smaller absolute value
(e.g., –0.5 < score < 0.5) of the score indicated a lowerconfidence classification. The default cutoff between a
positive and a negative decision was zero, but other cutoff
values could be used to trade sensitivity for specificity.

under the curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic
curve. The system provided binary prediction results
for all samples, i.e., there was not an intermediate-risk
classification for the predictions. The HRs and curves were
generated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the comparison
between the curves was performed with the log-rank test.
All calculations were conducted in GraphPad’s PRISM
software.

Statistical analysis
The group distributions for each clinicopathological
trait were compared through a two-tailed Fisher’s exact
procedure and the chi-square test. Numerical values were
compared through Student’s t-test. Data are expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation. Multivariate analysis
was performed with the Cox proportional hazard model.
Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Statistical
analyses were performed with the SPSS package (version
16.0 for Windows, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Blind validation testing
A two-stage method was used to generate each of
the three prediction models. In the first stage, one-third
of the samples were set aside as the blind test set with
no clinical information available. The remaining samples
in the training set had unblinded clinical information to
allow for the generation of the prediction models. After
the training, the performance of the prediction model
was determined with the blind test set. After the model
yielded the prediction results for the previously reserved
blind samples, only then were the clinical statuses of those
samples revealed so that the prediction accuracy of the
model could be calculated.
After the validation of the first-stage training
process, no programming modifications were made to
the model during the second stage of model generation.
This ensured that no new bias was introduced. During
the second stage, the training set and blind test sets were
studied together, and a leave-five-out iteration method was
used to calculate the final performance.
