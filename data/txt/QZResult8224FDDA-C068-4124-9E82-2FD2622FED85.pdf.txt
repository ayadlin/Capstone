Abstract

Introduction

Colonic carcinogenesis involves the progressive dysregulation
of homeostatic mechanisms that control growth. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) regulates colonocyte
growth and differentiation and is overexpressed in many
human colon cancers. A requirement for EGFR in colonic
premalignancy, however, has not been shown. In the current
study, we used a specific EGFR antagonist, gefitinib, to
investigate this role of the receptor in azoxymethane colonic
premalignancy. The azoxymethane model shares many clinical, histologic, and molecular features of human colon cancer.
Mice received azoxymethane i.p. (5 mg/kg/wk) or saline for
6 weeks. Animals were also gavaged with gefitinib (10 mg/kg
body weight) or vehicle (DMSO) thrice weekly for 18 weeks,
a dose schedule that inhibited normal receptor activation by
exogenous EGF. Compared with control colonocytes [bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), 2.2 F 1.2%], azoxymethane significantly increased proliferation (BrdUrd, 12.6 F 2.8%), whereas
gefitinib inhibited this hyperproliferation (BrdUrd, 6.2 F 4.0%;
<0.005). Azoxymethane significantly induced pro-transforming
growth factor-A (6.4 F 1.3–fold) and increased phospho(active) EGFR (5.9 F 1.1–fold), phospho-(active) ErbB2 (2.3 F
0.2–fold), and phospho-(active) extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (3.3 F 0.4–fold) in premalignant colonocytes. Gefitinib
inhibited activations of these kinases by >75% (P < 0.05).
Gefitinib also significantly reduced the number of large
aberrant crypt foci and decreased the incidence of colonic
microadenomas from 75% to 33% (P < 0.05). Gefitinib
concomitantly decreased cell cycle–regulating cyclin D1 and
prostanoid biosynthetic enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 in microadenomas, suggesting that these regulators are key targets
of EGFR in colonic carcinogenesis. These results show for
the first time that EGFR signaling is required for early stages
of colonic carcinogenesis. Our findings suggest, moreover,
that inhibitors of EGFR might be useful in chemopreventive
strategies in individuals at increased risk for colonic
malignancies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):827–35]

Colonic carcinogenesis involves a stepwise accumulation of
mutations in tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes (1).
These mutations in turn dysregulate mechanisms controlling crypt
cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis that are normally
controlled by multiple homeostatic mechanisms, including signals
from the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR; ref. 2).
EGFR belongs to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
that also includes ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Normal colonocytes
express EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 (3–5). ErbB receptors have an
extracellular domain that binds ErbB ligands with high affinity,
a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain.
The intracellular domain contains a tyrosine kinase and multiple
effector domains. With ligand binding, the ErbB receptors form
homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes. This dimerization
activates the intrinsic RTK that in turn phosphorylates in trans
multiple tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic receptor tail. These
autophosphorylation sites, and adjacent residues, create domains
that recruit adapter and effector proteins that propagate
downstream signals (2). Downstream pathways include Ras/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (2). Targets of these signaling pathways include
cyclin D1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2; refs. 6–8). Cyclin D1 is an
important EGFR target that controls G1-S cell cycle progression (9).
COX-2 is the key inducible and rate-limiting enzyme required for
prostaglandin biosynthesis (10).
Multiple ligands for ErbB receptors have been described. Some
ligands bind to unique ErbB receptors, whereas others can bind to
multiple ErbB receptors. The diverse combinations of ErbB
ligands and receptors afford multiple levels of control by these
potent growth-regulating signals (2, 11). In human colon cancers,
alterations in ErbB receptors, including up-regulation of EGFR
and ErbB2, and increases in EGFR ligands, including transforming
growth factor-a (TGF-a), have been described (4, 12, 13).
Increases in EGFR or ErbB2 expression portend greater invasiveness of these tumors and a worse prognosis (14, 15). Cyclin D1
and COX-2 are also up-regulated in human and experimental
colon cancers (8, 16, 17).
Although studies indicate that several ErbB receptors are
overexpressed in many advanced human colon cancers, inhibitors
or antibodies to these receptors alone possess limited clinical
efficacy (18). Presumably, many tumors have acquired activating
mutations downstream of EGFR or exploited other growthpromoting signals, rendering EGFR signaling redundant. In
contrast to the relatively small number of established colon

cancers responsive to EGFR inhibitors, colonic epithelial cells early
in malignant transformation are more likely to require EGFR signaling for proliferation and survival and hence to remain susceptible
to cell cycle arrest or death by EGFR blockade (19, 20). For this
reason, determining EGFR requirements early in colonic premalignancy is especially important.
We have used the azoxymethane model of colon cancer to
elucidate EGFR requirements in colonic premalignancy. Azoxymethane is a selective colonic procarcinogen that induces G to
A transitions and leads to activating mutations in K-ras and
h-catenin in colonocytes (21). The azoxymethane model recapitulates many of the clinical, histologic, and molecular features
of sporadic human colon cancers, with tumors arising within
24 weeks of azoxymethane treatment (21). We showed previously
that ErbB2 can be up-regulated in azoxymethane-induced
tumors, along with activation of wild-type (WT) Ras and ERK
and increases in COX-2, downstream effectors of EGFR (8). In this
model, there is a progression from aberrant crypt foci (ACF) to
adenomas and finally invasive cancers (22). ACF are the earliest
identifiable mucosal abnormalities in carcinogen-treated rodents
and are also frequently present in humans harboring colonic
neoplastic lesions (22, 23). Large ACF with dysplastic features are
often hyperproliferative and believed to be precursors of colon
cancer (24, 25). In a recent study, we showed that EGFR signaling
was up-regulated in >40% of human hyperproliferative ACF with
chromoendoscopic features of dysplasia (26).
In this study, we examined the effects of gefitinib to assess
the causal role of EGFR in colonic carcinogenesis. Gefitinib, a
synthetic analinoquinazoline, is an orally bioavailable specific
EGFR inhibitor that is active in the submicromolar concentration
range (IC50, 0.03 Amol/L). This inhibitor possesses a 100-fold
greater selectivity for EGFR over other ErbB members. Gefitinib
is even more selective when inhibitory concentrations for EGFR
are compared with those required to inhibit other tyrosine and
serine/threonine kinases (27). In preclinical studies, gefitinib
potently inhibited EGFR-dependent cell proliferation in vitro and
retarded neoplastic growth in vivo in tumor xenograft models
(27). As a single agent, however, gefitinib has limited clinical
efficacy against established colon cancers that are likely driven
by multiple signaling pathways (18). It was of interest, therefore,
to examine the effect of this agent in early stages of colonic
carcinogenesis.
Because there is no curative therapy for advanced tumors,
efforts are increasingly focused on chemopreventive strategies.
Progress in this area will depend on improved understanding of
signaling pathways required for tumorigenesis. This study was
undertaken to test the hypothesis that EGFR is required for
colonic tumorigenesis at the premalignant phase. We first
established a dose and treatment schedule with gefitinib that
inhibited EGFR signaling in normal mouse colon. We then
assessed the effects of azoxymethane induction and gefitinib
treatment on early stages of colonic carcinogenesis in premalignant colonocytes. We established for the first time that azoxymethane-induced crypt cell hyperproliferation, ACF growth, and
microadenoma appearance were accompanied by increased EGFR
signaling in this model. Furthermore, gefitinib inhibited EGFR
signaling and concomitantly reduced the incidence of microadenomas. These studies indicate that EGFR is required for
colonic premalignant progression. In addition, EGFR inhibition
offers a potentially important strategy for chemoprevention of
colon cancer in high-risk individuals.

Methods
Experimental animal protocols and tissue harvest
EGFR signaling in normal colon. Male A/J mice (25 g) were maintained
on AIN-76A rodent chow diet in approved specific pathogen-free facilities
with 12-h light and 12-h darkness in a temperature range of 22jC to 25jC
and humidity of 25% to 35%. All animal procedures were reviewed and
approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and followed NIH guidelines. For EGFR signaling in normal
mouse colon, animals were gavaged thrice weekly with 50 AL gefitinib
(10 mg/kg body weight) or DMSO (vehicle). Two hours after the third
gavage, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (70 mg i.p./kg body weight)
and xylazine (7 mg i.p./kg body weight). The abdominal viscera were
exposed by a laparotomy. Mice were given the indicated doses of EGF ( final
volume of 25 AL) or vehicle (PBS) by intracardiac injection. Colons were
harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. In preliminary time course
studies, maximal receptor activation occurred 5 min after EGF injection.
For some experiments, a segment of left colon was fixed in 10% buffered
formalin.
Azoxymethane studies. For carcinogen studies, male A/J mice, initially
weighing 20 to 25 g, were treated with 5 mg azoxymethane i.p./kg body
weight or vehicle (saline) weekly for 6 weeks. Carcinogen-treated (40 mice)
and saline-treated (20 mice) groups were divided equally to receive gefitinib
(10 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (DMSO) by gavage thrice weekly
beginning in week 1. Animals were weighed weekly and sacrificed 18 weeks
after the first azoxymethane injection (Fig. 1). Two hours before sacrifice,
animals received 50 mg BrdUrd i.p./kg body weight to label S-phase
colonocytes. A circular segment of distal left colon was fixed in 10% buffered
formalin for BrdUrd incorporation. The remaining colons were opened
longitudinally and fixed flat in 10% buffered formalin for immunostaining or
flash frozen for Western blotting. In colons fixed flat in formalin, ACF were
visualized by methylene blue staining with a 20 dissecting microscope by
an investigator unaware of the treatment conditions. ACF were identified as
crypts with increased methylene blue staining and expanded pericryptal
spaces. ACF were predominantly localized to the left colon. Total ACF
numbers and size (number of component crypts) were counted and
expressed as mean F SE for each group. Large ACF were operationally
defined as ACF with six or more component crypts. For K-ras mutation
analysis, large ACF were isolated by dermal punch and trimmed to remove

adjacent normal-appearing crypts. Colons were then divided longitudinally
and paraffin embedded as Swiss rolls as described (28). H&E-stained
sections were examined for colonic microadenomas identified by an expert
gastrointestinal pathologist (J.H.) following recently published consensus
criteria (29).

Western Blotting

Immunostaining

Frozen left colons were mechanically pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a
mortar and pestle chilled in a liquid nitrogen bath. Tissues were sonicated
and then homogenized with a Polytron (power setting of 4  30 s) in 1.5 mL
nondenaturing lysis buffer containing 25 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
125 mmol/L NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and
2% glycerol. Colonic proteins were extracted in SDS-containing Laemmli
buffer and measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were subjected to
quantitative Western blotting analysis as described (8). Briefly, proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4% to 20% resolving polyacrylamide
gradient gels and electroblotted to PVDF membranes. Blots were incubated
overnight at room temperature with specific primary antibodies followed
by 2 h of incubation with appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and subsequent detection on X-OMAT film by enhanced chemiluminescence. Xerograms were digitized with an Epson scanner (San Jose,
CA), and band intensity was quantified using IP Lab Gel (Scanalytics,
Rockville, MD). Western blotting band intensities were expressed in
arbitrary units and normalized to fold increases compared with control
colons from mice treated with saline (azoxymethane vehicle) and receiving
DMSO (gefitinib vehicle) by gavage.

For immunostaining, 5-micron sections of formalin-fixed paraffinembedded colons, prepared as Swiss rolls or as transverse circular colonic
segments (BrdUrd), were cut and mounted on Vectabond-coated Superfrost
Plus slides. The slides were heated to 60jC for 1 h, deparaffinized by 5-min
washes for three times in xylene, hydrated by a graded series of ethanol
washes, and rinsed with distilled water. BrdUrd, pERK, and COX-2 antigens
were retrieved by microwave heating for 15 min in 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer
(pH 7.0) or Ki-67 (pH 9) as described (30). For cyclin D1, epitope retrieval
was achieved by heating slides in a steamer with Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9).
Slides were then washed in TBS Tween 20 (TBST) thrice for 2 min. The
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with methanol/H2O2
solution (1.0%) in the dark for 15 min. Sections were washed thrice with
TBST for 2 min and nonspecific binding was blocked using Protein Block
for 20 min. Sections were incubated at 4jC with primary antibodies
(overnight with anti-BrdUrd, 1:50; anti-pERK, 1:450; anti-COX-2, 1:200 or for
1 h with anti-Ki-67, 1:300, or anti-cyclin D1, 1:50) followed by incubation
with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200) at room temperature.
Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by DAKO EnVision Plus System,
Peroxidase (DAKO EnVision Plus System, horseradish peroxidase), using
3,3¶-diaminobenzidine as substrate. After washing with distilled water, the
slides were counterstained with Gill’s III hematoxylin, rinsed with water,
dehydrated with ethanol, and cleared with xylene. For negative controls,
sections were incubated with isotype-matched irrelevant antibodies. For

Briefly, mismatched 5¶ primers created restriction sites for BstN1 in WT

there were no differences in weight gain between the control
group on AIN-76A alone and the group supplemented with
gefitinib. Therefore, for the growth analysis, these two groups
were combined and shown as control in Fig. 1B. While not
affecting body weight, gefitinib caused the development of a wavy
hair coat and curly whiskers. These results are an indirect
confirmation of active drug effects as this hair pattern is
characteristic of loss of EGFR signaling in the epidermis of mice
deficient in TGF-a (33). During carcinogen treatment, the azoxymethane alone and azoxymethane plus gefitinib groups lagged
behind the control groups with respect to body weight but then
resumed comparable growth rates for the remainder of the study.
The carcinogen-treated groups were f10% lower in final body
weights compared with controls (Fig. 1B). Importantly, there were
no differences in growth curves or mean body weights between the
azoxymethane alone group and the azoxymethane plus gefitinib
group (Fig. 1B).
Gefitinib inhibits azoxymethane-induced hyperproliferation
and ACF growth. Numerous studies, including our own investigations in the azoxymethane model, have indicated that colonic
neoplastic transformation is accompanied by crypt cell hyperproliferation and ACF development (25, 30). In agreement with
prior reports, azoxymethane increased proliferation in the colonic
mucosa as assessed by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2). Crypt cell
proliferation in the control- and gefitinib-treated groups were
low, with BrdUrd incorporation of 2.2 F 1.2% and 1.8 F 0.9%,
respectively. Azoxymethane treatment increased BrdUrd incorporation significantly to 12.6 F 2.8% (P < 0.05). In contrast, gefitinib
significantly inhibited azoxymethane-induced hyperproliferation
to 6.2 F 4.0, a 50% reduction in BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2;
Table 1; P < 0.05). These changes in proliferation were mirrored by
similar changes in ACF growth. ACF were found predominantly in
the left colon in agreement with prior studies (24). Compared with
azoxymethane alone, gefitinib caused a 24.4% reduction in the

Statistical Methods
Data were expressed as mean F SD or SE as indicated. Statistical
comparisons of differences in total and large ACF and in microadenoma
multiplicities were determined by Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analyses.
Western blotting protein expression levels and BrdUrd labeling were
compared by unpaired Student’s t test. Incidences of microadenomas and
K-ras mutations were compared by Fisher exact test. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results
Effects of gefitinib on normal EGFR signaling and mouse
growth. For these studies, we chose A/J mice as they are
susceptible to tumor induction by azoxymethane (32). Because
our major objective was to examine the effect of EGFR inhibition
in colonic carcinogenesis, before conducting the carcinogen study,
we assessed the ability of gefitinib to block signaling induced by
exogenous EGF in normal mouse colon. Using the dose schedule
described in Materials and Methods, gefitinib significantly inhibited EGF-induced activations of EGFR and ErbB2 and downstream effectors, ERK and AKT (Supplementary Fig. S1A–C). We
confirmed by immunostaining that ERK activation was predominantly confined to the colonic epithelial cells and blocked by
gefitinib (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Thus, in normal mouse colon,
gefitinib inhibited EGFR signals when given by gavage at this dose
and frequency.
For carcinogenesis studies, mice were treated with azoxymethane (5 mg i.p./kg body weight) or saline weekly for 6 weeks.
The animals concomitantly received gefitinib (10 mg/kg body
weight) or DMSO (vehicle) by gavage thrice weekly as summarized
in the protocol in Fig. 1A. For mice not receiving azoxymethane,

Importantly, gefitinib caused a significant reduction in the mean
number of large ACF/mouse (ACF containing six or more
component crypts) from 12 F 2 in the azoxymethane alone group
to 6 F 1 (50% reduction) in the azoxymethane plus gefitinib group
(Table 1; P < 0.05). Because large ACF are associated with an
increased risk for malignant progression, inhibition of ACF growth
is likely of biological relevance (24).
Gefitinib inhibits azoxymethane-induced microadenoma
formation. There were very few visible colonic lesions when
animals were sacrificed at 18 weeks. Typically, azoxymethane
tumor studies are carried out beyond 24 weeks (34). To detect

intraepithelial neoplastic lesions, we prepared Swiss rolls from
full-length colons in the azoxymethane alone group and the
azoxymethane plus gefitinib group. Three sections, each separated
by 50 microns, were stained with H&E and examined for
microadenomas. Intervening unstained sections were used for
immunostaining. We identified 17 microadenomas from 9 of 12
animals in the azoxymethane alone group. In contrast, we found
five microadenomas from 4 of 12 animals in the azoxymethane plus
gefitinib group (Table 1). Thus, gefitinib significantly reduced the
incidence of microadenomas from 75% to 33% (P < 0.05). Gefitinib
also significantly reduced tumor multiplicity from 1.9 to 1.2
microadenomas per tumor-bearing animal (Table 1; P = 0.02)

was up-regulated 6-fold in the azoxymethane group (Fig. 4).
Presumably, increased TGF-a and possibly other EGFR ligands
trigger EGFR signaling in azoxymethane colonic carcinogenesis.
Interestingly, gefitinib alone increased TGF-a, perhaps as a
feedback response to EGFR blockade.
Gefitinib inhibits azoxymethane-induced cyclin D1 and
COX-2 but not B-catenin up-regulation. We examined microadenomas for h-catenin expression, as many studies have shown
adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/h-catenin signals play critical
roles in colonic carcinogenesis (35). We found by immunostaining
that h-catenin was up-regulated in nuclear and cytoplasmic

Inhibition of microadenoma formation confirms the biological
relevance of EGFR blockade with gefitinib in the azoxymethane
model. In the gefitinib-treated group, adenomas also appeared to
have decreased pERK immunostaining (Fig. 3, compare A and B)
and lower proliferation, as assessed by Ki-67 staining (Fig. 3,
compare C and D). These local reductions in proliferation and ERK
signaling within the microadenomas were in agreement with the
generalized decreased crypt cell proliferation and inhibited EGFR
signaling that were found as field effects in the colonic mucosa
(see Fig. 4 below).
Gefitinib inhibits azoxymethane-induced EGFR signaling.
To identify EGFR signaling correlates of azoxymethane-induced
hyperproliferation and microadenoma formation, we examined
activation of EGFR and ErbB2 and downstream effectors in
azoxymethane premalignancy. As shown in Fig. 4, azoxymethane
significantly induced the activation of EGFR (5.9 F 1.2–fold;

this model. We detected mutations in 5 of 26 (19%) ACF in the
azoxymethane alone group and in 0 of 15 (0%) ACF from the
azoxymethane plus gefitinib group (Table 1). Although these
numerical differences suggested that gefitinib might inhibit the
development of tumors with K-ras mutations, they did not reach
statistical significance (P = 0.09). Moreover, this frequency of K-ras
mutations was in agreement with prior reports (41). Because Ras
was WT (and therefore regulated by EGFR) in ACF from gefitinibtreated animals, we infer that gefitinib would inhibit EGFR
downstream effectors, such as ERK, an effector of Ras, in these
ACF. Interestingly, we have shown that ursodeoxycholic acid,
another chemopreventive agent in the azoxymethane model,
suppressed the development of tumors with K-ras mutations or
activated WT Ras (34). In future longer-term studies with overt
tumors, it will be of interest to assess whether gefitinib can in fact
inhibit the development of tumors with mutant Ras similar to
other chemopreventive agents in this model (34, 42).

distributions in all microadenomas, irrespective of treatment
group (data not shown). Although cyclin D1 is a well-recognized
target of h-catenin, it is also a downstream target of EGFR (6, 36).
In other tumor cell types, EGFR blockade has been shown to inhibit
cyclin D1 expression (37). We therefore examined the effects of
gefitinib on cyclin D1 as potentially contributing to the chemopreventive effects of gefitinib. As shown in Fig. 5A, cyclin D1 was
strongly expressed in a diffuse and nuclear pattern in azoxymethane-induced microadenomas. In contrast, azoxymethaneinduced cyclin D1 overexpression was reduced in microadenomas
from gefitinib-treated animals (Fig. 5B). Cyclin D1 was increased
in 7 of 10 azoxymethane-induced microadenomas, whereas, in
the gefitinib-treated group, expression levels were comparable with
adjacent mucosa in all five microadenomas examined. Thus, upregulated h-catenin in the presence of EGFR blockade is not
sufficient to drive increased cyclin D1 expression in azoxymethane
microadenomas. Furthermore, the effects of gefitinib on cyclin
D1 (Fig. 5B) paralleled the proliferation changes we observed
in microadenomas as assessed by Ki-67 staining (Fig. 3D).
COX-2 also plays a critical role in colonic carcinogenesis and is
another target of APC/h-catenin signaling (10, 38). Like cyclin D1,
COX-2 is also a downstream target of EGFR (39). We showed
previously that COX-2 was increased in azoxymethane tumors
expressing WT Ras activated by EGFR-related ErbB2 (8). In
agreement with these studies, COX-2 was up-regulated in azoxymethane microadenomas (Fig. 5C). In contrast, gefitinib inhibited
COX-2 expression in these microadenomas (Fig. 5D). Thus, gefitinib
inhibited up-regulations of cyclin D1 and COX-2 that we speculate
are EGFR targets required for microadenoma development.
Effects of azoxymethane and gefitinib on K-ras mutations.
K-ras mutations occur in the azoxymethane model and could be
responsible for EGFR-independent activation of downstream
effectors and targets, including ERK and COX-2 (8, 31). In other
cell types, K-ras mutations have been associated with resistance
to gefitinib (40). We therefore examined ACF for G to A K-ras
mutations in codon 12, the predominant site of mutations in

Discussion
In this study, we have shown for the first time that EGFR
signaling is up-regulated by the microadenoma stage in the
azoxymethane model of colon cancer. We have also shown that
gefitinib inhibits EGFR signaling and concomitantly limits
neoplastic progression in this premalignant phase. These studies
are important because they have elucidated an important growthpromoting requirement for EGFR in colonic premalignancy and
identified this growth factor signaling pathway as a target for new
chemoprevention strategies.
To confirm that EGFR activation was important in malignant
transformation, we used a pharmacologic approach using the
EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Gefitinib is a
substituted analinoquinazoline that interacts with the ATP binding
site of EGFR to block kinase activity (27). Quinazolines have been
shown to cause receptor dimerization and internalization while
blocking receptor autophosphorylation and signal propagation

with those findings, other authors have shown that COX-2 is a
target of EGFR signaling in colon cancer cells (39). In the current
study, EGFR activation was accompanied by up-regulation of
pERK and its downstream effector COX-2 in microadenomas.
The ability of gefitinib to suppress ERK activation and COX-2 upregulation in microadenomas likely contributes to the chemopreventive effects of this agent in this model. Thus, although
APC/h-catenin signals regulate cyclin D1 and COX-2 in colonic
carcinogenesis (36, 38), we have shown that their up-regulations
also require EGFR signaling in the azoxymethane model. Our
studies, moreover, have extended the Min mouse findings by
identifying cyclin D1 and COX-2 as EGFR targets of the chemopreventive effects of gefitinib.
Our findings have important clinical implications for receptor
blockade as a chemopreventive strategy in individuals at increased
risk for this malignancy (51). Prior studies have shown that
gefitinib can inhibit both EGFR- and ErbB2-dependent colonic and
noncolonic cancer cell growth in vitro and reduce neoplastic
growth in tumor xenograft models (27, 52). In a chemopreventive
setting, transforming colonic epithelial cells are likely to remain
susceptible to cell cycle arrest or death by EGFR blockade (19, 20).
Gefitinib, when used in combination with EGFR-independent
inhibitors, has also been shown to synergize for growth inhibition
of tumor xenografts (53). Combination chemopreventive therapies
might allow lower doses of individual agents that are better
tolerated and associated with less drug resistance in transforming
cells. Theoretically, more than one mutation might be required
to block the inhibitory effects of drugs that act by independent
mechanisms.
In summary, this is the first study to our knowledge to show that
EGFR is activated and downstream effector signaling increased at
the microadenoma stage of colonic tumorigenesis. Furthermore,
gefitinib inhibited microadenoma formation and concomitantly
blocked up-regulation of EGFR targets, cyclin D1 and COX-2, in
these lesions. Because cyclin D1 and COX-2 play critical roles in
colonic tumorigenesis, gefitinib inhibition of these EGFR signals
and blockade of neoplastic progression strongly support our
hypothesis that early colonic malignant transformation requires
EGFR signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest that EGFR
inhibitors could provide new chemopreventive strategies in
patients at increased risk for colon cancer.

(43). The specificity of the inhibitor was important because
genistein, a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had been
shown previously to paradoxically increase tumor development in
the azoxymethane model (44). Before embarking on premalignant
studies, we examined the ability of gefitinib to inhibit EGF-induced
signaling in normal colon. Using the dose schedule described in
Fig. 1, we showed that gefitinib significantly inhibited EGF-induced
EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylations and decreased ERK
and AKT activations in normal mouse colonocytes (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
We showed previously in rat azoxymethane tumors that ErbB2
up-regulation can activate WT Ras and increase ERK signaling and
COX-2 expression (8). In this study, we examined EGFR signaling
in the premalignant phase of azoxymethane-treated mice. EGFR
and ErbB2 were activated and downstream signaling up-regulated
in a generalized manner in the colon, reflecting a ‘‘field effect’’ at
the microadenoma stage before the emergence of visible tumors.
The proform of TGF-a was increased 18 weeks after azoxymethane
treatment and presumably drives this increased EGFR signaling.
Gefitinib decreased this growth signaling of the receptor and
limited azoxymethane-induced hyperproliferation, ACF growth,
and microadenoma appearance. Our results are in broad agreement with studies in the Min mouse, a genetic model of intestinal
tumorigenesis. Min mice carry a germ-line mutation of the APC
gene and consequently possess increased h-catenin signaling.
Pharmacologic or genetic blockade of EGFR inhibited the growth
of Min adenomas in the small intestine (45). Thus, in addition to
h-catenin, it would seem that EGFR signaling is also required for
azoxymethane tumorigenesis.
Cyclin D1 dysregulation contributes to aberrant proliferation in
many types of tumors, including colon cancer, and is overexpressed
in azoxymethane and human colonic carcinogenesis as early as
the ACF stage (16, 26, 30, 46). Cyclin D1 is also an important mitogenic target of TGF-a and EGFR signaling (6, 47). In this study,
we showed that gefitinib inhibited the up-regulation of cyclin D1
in microadenomas. Recent studies showing EGFR in the nucleus
suggest an intriguing role for this receptor as a transcriptional
regulator (6). In this regard, EGFR has been shown to bind to an ATrich region in the cyclin D1 promoter and to activate this promoter
(6). We have also shown recently that cyclin D1 is overexpressed in a
subset of large hyperproliferative human ACF with up-regulated
EGFR signaling (26). Thus, cyclin D1 seems to be an important
EGFR target in colonic carcinogenesis that is required for
development of microadenomas.
COX-2 is also up-regulated in azoxymethane and human colonic
tumors (8, 10, 34). This overexpression has been reported as early
as the ACF stage (48, 49). Enzymatic blockade of COX-2
significantly reduced tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane model,
showing the critical role this protein plays in neoplastic
transformation (50). We showed previously that EGFR-related
ErbB2 increased COX-2 in azoxymethane tumors (8). In agreement
