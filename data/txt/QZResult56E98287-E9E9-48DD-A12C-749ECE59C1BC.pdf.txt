ABSTRACT
We identified the specific role of vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) in the
progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and evaluated its therapeutic and
prognostic potential. VRK1 levels were significantly higher in HCC cell lines than
a normal hepatic cell line, and were higher in HCC than non-tumor tissue. VRK1
knockdown inhibited the proliferation of SK-Hep1, SH-J1 and Hep3B cells; moreover,
depletion of VRK1 suppressed HCC tumor growth in vivo. We also showed that VRK1
knockdown increased the number of G1 arrested cells by decreasing cyclin D1 and
p-Rb while upregulating p21 and p27, and that VRK1 depletion downregulated
phosphorylation of CREB, a transcription factor regulating CCND1. Additionally, we
found that luteolin, a VRK1 inhibitor, suppressed HCC growth in vitro and in vivo, and
that the aberrant VRK1 expression correlated with poor prognostic features of HCC.
High levels of VRK1 were associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival
and higher recurrence rates. Taken together, our findings suggest VRK1 may act as
a tumor promoter by controlling the level of cell cycle regulators associated with
G1/S transition and could potentially serve as a therapeutic target and/or prognostic
biomarker for HCC.

and surgical resection and liver transplantation have
limited applicability due to frequent tumor recurrence [4].
Undoubtedly, a better understanding of the mechanisms
underlying HCC progression is crucial for effective
treatment of the disease.
Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is a member of
the Ser/Thr kinase family in mammals [3], and is involved
in cell cycle progression, chromosome condensation,
nuclear envelope breakdown and reassembly and the DNA
damage response. VRK1 acts through phosphorylation of
several substrates, including CRE binding protein, histone
H3, barrier-to-autointegration factor and p53 [4–9]. VRK1

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer-related death among males and the sixth most
common cause of death among females, worldwide [1].
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 85% to 90%
primary liver cancers [2]. Although therapeutic options
for HCC have improved in recent years, incidences of the
disease have remained high in Eastern and South-Eastern
Asia and are increasing in the United States and Central
Europe [1]. The major reason for unsuccessful treatment
of HCC is resistance to conventional chemotherapy [3],

mediates p53 accumulation by increasing its stability
through phosphorylation of Thr-18 within its mdm-2
binding site [10, 11]. At the same time, VRK1 levels are
downregulated by p53, forming autoregulatory loop [12].
This p53-induced downregulation of VRK1 is dependent
on an autophagic pathway and protein degradation by
lysosomes [13].
Emerging evidence suggests VRK1 plays an
essential role in cancer progression [3]. For example, high
levels of VRK1 mRNA have been detected in actively
proliferating cells within fetal tissues and in several cancer
cell lines [14]. In addition, VRK1 expression correlates
positively with several proliferation markers in head-andneck squamous cell cancers and lung carcinomas [15, 16],
and VRK1 levels tend to be elevated in lung cancer tissues
in which p53 is mutated [16]. In breast cancer, VRK1
depletion inhibits tumor growth and metastasis [17] and
confers resistance to DNA-damaging agents [18], and it
has been suggested that VRK1 is a potential therapeutic
target and a prognostic marker for breast cancer [19, 20].
On the other hand, there have been few studies
examining the precise role of VRK1 in the progression of
HCC or its clinical association with HCC. In the present
study, therefore, our aim was to determine the function
of VRK1 within HCC tissues and cell lines. Our findings
suggest that VRK1 enhances HCC cell proliferation by
modulating the levels of regulators associated with G1/S
transition and that VRK1 levels are much higher in HCC
tissues than non-tumor tissues, and are associated with
shorter overall and disease-free survival and a higher
recurrence rate. Based on these findings, we propose that
VRK1 could potentially serve as a therapeutic target and/
or a prognostic marker in HCC.

inverse correlation between p53 and VRK1 levels in the
seven cell lines. We then examined VRK1 levels after
transfecting SK-Hep1, SH-J1 and Hep3B cells with
increasing amounts of pcDNA_p53 and the same amount
of pCMV_VRK1-flag (Sup. 1A and 1B). As the level of
p53 increased, the level of VRK1 expression declined in
these cells (Sup. 1A and 1B). Thus an inverse relation
was detected between the levels of VRK1 and ectopically
expressed p53 (Sup. 1A and 1B).
The status of p53 in the tested HCC cell lines was
examined previously and those findings are summarized in
Table 1. p53 is wild-type in THLE-2, SH-J1, SK-Hep1 and
HepG2 cells, but is mutated in Huh-7 and SNU449 cells,
and null in Hep3 cells. As with p53 expression levels, there
was no correlation between the status of p53 and VRK1
levels in any of the seven cell lines (Fig. 1A and 1B).
Additionally, because HBV infection is a major risk factor
for HCC development, the association between HBV status
and VRK1 expression was assessed in the seven cell lines,
several of which are HBV-positive (Table 1). However, we
found no significant correlation between VRK1 expression
and HBV status .
To better understand the molecular function of
VRK1 in HCC tumorigenesis, we transiently silenced
VRK1 expression or overexpressed VRK1 in THLE-2 and
HCC cell lines, after which we measured cell proliferation
using WST-1 assays. Western blotting showed that VRK1
was efficiently knocked down or overexpressed by
transfection of a targeted siRNA or expression vector,
respectively (Fig. 1C and 1D, upper panel). Significant
reductions in proliferation were observed in HCC cell
lines following VRK1 knockdown (P < 0.001), but not
in THLE-2 cells (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Conversely,
overexpression of VRK1 significantly enhanced the
proliferation of SH-J1 and Hep3B cells (P < 0.001), but
not SK-Hep1 cells (Fig. 1D, lower panel). To further
evaluate the long-term effects of reducing VRK1
expression on cellular proliferation, we performed as
set of colony formation assays (Fig. 2E). Knocking
down VRK1 expression reduced the size of all HCC cell
colonies (P < 0.001), with the most dramatic effect on SKHep1 cells, which normally express the highest level of
VRK1 (19.86% ± 0.27), and the smallest effect on Hep3B
cells, which normally express the lowest levels of VRK1
(74.92% ± 6.98; Fig. 2E). By contrast, knocking down
VRK1 had no significant effect on the size of THLE-2 cell
colonies (97.16 ± 3.81; Fig. 2E and Sup. Fig. 2).

RESULTS
VRK1 is overexpressed in HCC cells and its
depletion suppresses HCC cell proliferation
in vitro
To identify the role of VRK1 in liver cancer, VRK1
levels were examined in an immortalized hepatocyte cell
line, THLE-2, and in six HCC cell lines, including SH-J1,
SK-Hep1, Huh-7, Hep3B, HepG2 and SNU449. With the
exception of Hep3B cells, which grow slower the other
HCC cells, VRK1 levels were higher in HCC cells than
THLE-2 cells (Fig. 1A and 1B). VRK1 expression is
known to be enhanced in lung cancers expressing a mutant
p53 and to be down-regulated by ectopic expression of
wild-type p53 in lung cancer cells [16]. Therefore, to
investigate why VRK1 levels are higher in HCC cells,
we checked the levels and status of p53. p53 expression
was relatively high in THLE-2, Huh-7 and SNU449 cells,
but low in SH-J1, SK-Hep1, HepG2 and Hep3B cells
(Fig. 1A and 1B). We found that there was not a detectable

transfection, which was set to 100%. D. Cells were transfected with flag- or VRK1-flag-expressing vectors, and VRK1 level was analyzed
by Western blotting 48 h after transfection. Increases of cell proliferation were significant in SH-J1 and Hep3B cells upon overexpression
of VRK1, but not in SK-Hep1 cells. E. Colony formation assays were performed using HCC or THLE-2 cells transfected with control

different knockdown efficiencies were observed with for
independent shRNAs targeting different sequences of
VRK1 (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Colony formation assays
with stable cell lines (clones 1 and 3) showed efficient
VRK1 knockdown and confirmed significant loss of
colony forming ability (P < 0.001; Fig. 2A, middle and
lower panel). Clone 1 expressing the lowest level of
VRK1 displayed the most dramatic decrease in colony
formation (4.73% ± 1.02, Fig. 2A, lower panel). After 3, 4,
5 and 6 weeks of viral transduction, stable cell lines were
subjected to Western blot analysis and colony formation
assays to confirm the anti-tumor effect by sustained VRK1
knockdown. Efficient knockdown and diminished colony
formation were maintained in stable VRK1-deficient cells
for least 6 weeks (Sup. Fig. 3A and 3B).
Once the stability of the VRK1 knockdown was
confirmed, we injected cell lines stably expressing VRK1
shRNA Clone 1 into the right flanks of nude mice and
negative control shRNA into the left flanks. Tumor
volumes were then determined every 2 weeks. Significant
differences in volume between tumors expressing shVRK1
and those expressing control shRNA were observed
beginning 4 weeks after injection (P < 0.01; Fig. 2B),
and at 8 weeks the mean volume of shVRK1-expressing
tumors was 196.67 ± 52.40 mm3, while that of tumors
expressing control shRNA was 324.61 ± 68.95 mm3
(Fig. 2B and 2C). In addition, the weights of shVRK1expressing tumors were correspondingly lower than the
weights of tumors expressing control shRNA
(111.67 ± 21.08 mg vs. 164.17 ± 37.17 mg; Fig. 2D).
To confirm the efficiency of the sustained VRK1
knockdown during tumor growth in vivo, Western blotting
was performed using tumor tissues collected from each
group of mice. Significant downregulation of VRK1
was observed in the tumor tissues derived from VRK1
knockdown cells, as expected (Fig. 2E). Additionally,
immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67, a general marker
of proliferating cells, showed significantly fewer Ki-67positive cells in tumors expressing shVRK1 (29.75 cells
± 78) than in those expressing negative control shRNA
(67.5 cells ± 15.77; Fig. 2F).

Anti-growth effects are generally explained as
the result of cell cycle disruption and/or apoptosis or
senescence induction. We explored the effects of VRK1
depletion on induction of apoptosis and cell cycle
regulation. Induction of apoptosis was measured using
the PI-Annexin V double staining method 24 h after
transfection (Sup. 4A and 4B). No significant induction of
apoptosis was detected in HCC cells following depletion
of VRK1 (Sup. 4A and 4B). On the other hand, 24 h after
transfection with VRK1 siRNA, the numbers of G1 phase
gated cells were significantly higher in SK-Hep1 and
SH-J1 than control cells, whereas the numbers of S phase
gated cells were lower (Fig. 3A and 3B). By contrast,
no significant changes in cell cycle populations were
found in Hep3B and THLE-2 cells after VRK1 depletion
in an asynchronous cell population (Fig. 3A and 3B).
Nocodazole arrests cell cycle progression in G2/M phase
by disrupting mitotic spindles [21], and so was used to
assess G1 arrest induced by VRK1 depletion. Following
nocodazole treatment, the majority of control cells were
synchronized at G2/M phase, whereas VRK1-depleted
cells could not be synchronized at G2/M phase at any time
during the time-course of the experiment (Fig. 3C and 3D).
Instead, most VRK1-depleted cells were at G1 phase
(Fig. 3C and 3D). The largest G1 phase gated cell fraction
was among VRK1-depleted SK-Hep1 cells (40.06% at
15 h, 37.79% at 17.5 h, 39.45% at 20 h; Fig. 3C and  3D),
followed by VRK1-depleted SH-J1 cells (36.28% at
15 h, 36.20% at 17.5 h, 35.74% at 20 h; Fig. 3C and 3D).
The smallest G1 phase gated cell fraction was among
VRK1-depleted Hep3B cells (18.47% at 15 h, 12.67
at 17.5 h, 7.84% at 20 h; Fig. 3C and 3D). Following
nocodazole treatment, the size of the G1 phase gated cell
fraction remained unchanged over the observation timecourse in VRK1-depleted SK-Hep1 and SH-J1 cells, but it
gradually declined in VRK1-depleted Hep3B cells (18.47%
at 15 h, 12.67% at 17.5 h and 7.87% at 20 h; 3C and 3D).

We next assessed the levels of cell cycle regulators
associated with G1/S transition in VRK1-depleted cells.
Effective silencing of VRK1 led to downregulation of
cyclin D1 involved in G1/S transition in HCC cell lines
(Fig. 4A). Rb protein is the substrate for cyclin D1 and
cdk 4/6 complex, and their phosphorylation is the crucial
step for initiating G1/S transition [22]. As we expected,
p-Rb795 and p-Rb807/811 levels were reduced by VRK1
depletion in HCC cells, except in Hep3B cells, which
do not express Rb protein (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, levels
of p27 and p21, which act as cell cycle inhibitors by
suppressing various cyclin/cdk complexes, were increased
by VRK1 depletion (Fig. 4A). Because the p21 levels are

known to be increased by p53 [23], and p53 is stabilized
by VRK1 [10], we checked p53 levels to be increased
or decreased in VRK1-depleted HCC cells. However,
no significant change of p53 level was observed in VRK1depleted HCC cells (Fig. 4A). Our group previously
showed that cyclin D1 was upregulated by VRK1 through
phosphorylation (activation) of CREB, which in turn
activates cyclin D1 transcription [8]. We therefore also
checked levels of the p-CREB and CREB proteins and
cyclin D1 mRNA. We found that p-CREB levels were
reduced by VRK1 inactivation in HCC cells (Fig. 4B and
4C), and there was a corresponding reduction the level of
cyclin D1 mRNA in VRK1-depleted HCC cells (Fig. 4D).

Luteolin, a VRK1 inhibitor, reduces HCC
growth

Because we found that VRK1 depletion retarded growth
of HCC cells, we tested whether a similar retardation
could be achieved by pharmacological blockade VRK1.
When HCC cells were treated with various concentrations
of luteolin, HCC cell proliferation was significantly

reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5B).
Relative cell proliferation at 40 and 50 μM luteolin was
71.70% ± 1.86 and 63.34% ± 6.58 for SK-Hep1 cells
(P < 0.01 and P < 0.001), 84.71% ± 4.63 and 73.19%
± 3.79 for SH-J1 cells (P < 0.001), and 71.18% ± 4.96
and 63.60% ± 6.72 for Hep3B cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 5B).
Luteolin has also been shown to induce apoptosis in
several types of cancers [24]. We therefore tested the
ability of luteolin to induce apoptosis in HCC cells.

We found that treatment with luteolin significantly and
concentration-dependently increased the incidence of
apoptosis among SK-Hep1 and SH-J1 cells (Fig. 5C and
Sup. 5A). In addition, a minor induction of apoptosis was
detected in Hep3B cells treated with luteolin (Fig. 5C and
Sup. 5A).
To confirm the anti-tumor effect of VRK1 inhibition
in vivo, luteolin was administered after subcutaneous
injection of SK-Hep1 cells into flanks of nude mice. Tumor

volumes were then determined weekly after the injection of
luteolin. Significant differences in tumor volume between
the luteolin-treated group (143.06 ± 26.03 mm3) and the
vehicle-treated group (344.47 ± 62.03 mm3) were observed
5 weeks after luteolin injection (P < 0.05; Fig. 6A). The
resulting tumor sizes in mice injected with luteolin were
smaller than those injected with vehicle (Fig. 6B and 6C).

Correspondingly, tumor weights were smaller in tumors
treated with luteolin (116 ± 15.77 mg) than in those treated
with vehicle (193 ± 22.80 mg; Fig. 6D). To assess the
toxicity of luteolin to mice, samples of liver tissue from
vehicle- and luteolin-treated mice were subjected to H&E
staining. No histological difference in the liver tissue was
observed between the two groups (Fig. 6E).

High VRK1 expression is associated with a poor

intensity of the VRK1 staining in each sample assigned a
score of 0 (negative staining, Fig. 7A), 1 (<5% staining,
Fig. 7B), 2 (<25% staining, Fig. 7C) or 3 (25–50%
staining, Fig. 7D). VRK1 levels were markedly higher
in tumors than in non-tumor specimens (0.0000 versus

immunohistochemical image of VRK1 in tumor and nontumor samples is shown in Fig. 7E. A higher number of
VRK1-positive cells was found in the tumor region than
the adjacent non-tumor region (Fig. 7E).

The fact that VRK1 might be oncogenic in HCC led
us to hypothesize that VRK1 could be strongly expressed
in HCC patients’ tissues and its expression predictive of
a poor prognosis. To test our hypothesis, VRK1 levels
were assessed immunohistochemically in 88 HCC
specimens. The clinicopathological characteristics of the
88 HCC patients were cataloged (Sup. Table 1), and the

We investigated the association between the VRK1
level and prognosis of HCC patients. Patients were
classified as VRK1-high and VRK1-low based on
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
using the highest area under the curve (AUC) that could
significantly discriminate between patients with good
and poor prognoses with respect to overall survival (OS).
HCCs with IHC intensities of 0–1 and 2–3 were classified
as VRK1-low and VRK1-high groups, respectively.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that median
recurrence times in patients with high and low VRK1
levels were 12.85 and 30.64 months, respectively
(P = 0.0356; Fig. 8A). The VRK1-high group also
displayed shorter OS (VRK1-high, 36.43 months;
VRK1-low, 53.92 months), but the differences were less
significant (P = 0.0734; Fig. 8B). The median diseasefree survival (DFS) was similar to median recurrence
time, with borderline significance (P = 0.0555; Fig. 8C).
Additionally, we used Fisher’s exact test to examine the
association between VRK1 levels and clinicopathological
characteristics. With the exception of age, there were no
significant differences in clinicopathological features,

including HBV and HCV status (P = 1.0), between the
VRK1-high and VRK1-low groups, (Sup. Table 2). The
VRK1-high group tended to be ≥ 55 years and VRK1-low
group to be < 55 years, with borderline of significance
(P = 0.051).
The prognostic significance of the VRK1 level
was further confirmed in a Cox regression analysis. In a
univariate analysis, the AFP level was related to significant
risk for both OS and DFS, and liver cirrhosis was the only
significant prognostic factor for OS (Table 2). Common
prognostic factors for recurrence, OS and DFS were
Edmondson grade, tumor size, tumor stage, vascular
invasion and tumor number (Table 2). Interestingly, a high
VRK1 level was a significant risk factor for recurrence
(P = 0.041), but not as much for OS and DFS (Table 2).
To further confirm VRK1 as an independent prognostic
marker for recurrence of HCC, multivariate Cox analysis
was performed with the aforementioned significant risk
variables for recurrence (Table 3). The multivariate Cox
model suggested that VRK1 could be an independent
prognostic factor for recurrence with borderline
significance (P = 0.056; Table 2).

levels, which were higher in HCC than healthy tissue,
were associated with shorter OS and DFS and a higher
recurrence rate in HCC patients.
Depletion of VRK1 using siRNA and shRNA

Consistent with that finding, VRK1 depletion was
previously shown to suppress cell proliferation in

WS1 fibroblastic cells and lung cancer cells [25, 26],
and to reduce tumor size in breast cancer in vivo [17].
We observed the most significant effect of VRK1
knockdown on HCC cell growth in SK-Hep1 cells,
which expressed the highest level of VRK1. Conversely,
transient overexpression of VRK1 did not significantly
affect SK-Hep1 cell proliferation. The smallest effect of
VRK1 knockdown was on Hep3B cells, which expressed
lowest levels of VRK1. Similarly, growth of THLE-2
cells, a normal liver cell line expressing low levels of
VRK1, was also not significantly affected by VRK
knockdown. Thus the differential sensitivities of cells to
VRK1 knockdown or overexpression appears to reflect
differences in basal VRK1 levels.
Xenograft assays confirmed that depletion of
VRK1 could suppress tumor growth in vivo. Both VRK1
and Ki-67 have been identified within proliferating
areas of squamous epithelium, and high levels of VRK1
correlated positively with Ki-67 in head and neck
squamous carcinomas [15]. Similarly, we showed here
that VRK1-positive cells within tumors in mice co-located
with Ki-67-positive cells. Furthermore, the number of
Ki-67  positive  cells was significantly lower in tumors
derived from VRK1-depleted SK-Hep1 cells than tumors
derived from intact SK-Hep1 cells. Taken together,
these findings suggest that VRK1 expression affects
the proliferation of tumor cells, that VRK1 knockdown
suppresses HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and that
the extent of its effect differs depending upon the basal
VRK1 level in HCC cells.
We found that siRNA-mediated depletion of VRK1
caused G1 arrest in HCC cells, which is consistent with
previous observations in H460 and H1299 lung cancer
cells and MCF 10A mammary epithelial cells [17, 26].
VRK1 also had distinct functions during G2/M phase,
including phosphorylation of proteins involved in
regulating the nuclear envelope, chromatin condensation
and Golgi fragmentation [3]. However, the number of cells
in G2/M phase was unaffected by VRK1 depletion in an
asynchronous cell population (Fig. 3A). This suggests
that during cell cycle progression in HCC cells, VRK1
function during G1/S phase may be more important than
during G2/M phase, or other mitotic kinases such as the
Aurora kinases and haspin may compensate for the loss
of VRK1. Indeed, overexpression of Aurora A and B
has been reported in HCC [27, 28]. Among SK-Hep1
and SH-J1 cells, which normally express high levels
of VRK1, VRK1 depletion with nocodazole treatment
significantly increased numbers of G1-arrested cells, but
this effect was not as significant in Hep3B cells, which
express very low levels of VRK1 (Fig. 3C and 3D).
Interestingly, the percentage of G1 gated cells gradually
declined in VRK1-depleted Hep3B cells (Fig. 3C and
3D), which implies VRK1 depletion led to delayed
G1/S transition in Hep3B cells. These findings may be
explained by the different genetic backgrounds of the
three cell lines. As in an earlier study of Rb-null Hep3B
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells [29], we failed to detect Rb proteins in Hep3B cell
lysates (Fig. 4A). Because the accumulation of p-Rb by
cyclin D and Cdk complexes could be a critical regulatory
step for G1/S transition [22], the reduction in cyclin D1
levels may not be as significant for G1/S phase transition
in Rb-null cells as in Hep3B cells. Thus, the extent of
its effect may be differently manifest, depending on the
genetic background of the HCC cells. Levels of cyclin D1,
p-Rb795 and p-Rb807/811 were all reduced in VRK1-depleted
cells, which is consistent with an earlier report showing
that cyclin D1 and p-Rb levels declined upon VRK1
downregulation in fibroblasts [25]. The reduction in the
levels of cyclin D1 was attributed to a decrease in its
gene’s transcription, which was in turn related to decreased
CREB phosphorylation in VRK1-depleted HCC cells. We
also observed that both p21 and p27 were upregulated
upon VRK1 knockdown, but that p53 levels were
unchanged (Fig. 4A). VRK1 thus appears to regulate p21
expression independently of p53, though the mechanism
by which VRK1 affects expression of p21 and p27 remains
to be clarified. Taken together, these findings indicate that
VRK1 depletion causes arrest or delay of G1/S transition,
leading to a significant increase in the HCC cell fraction
in G1 phase. This suggests the retardation of HCC cell
growth induced by VRK1 depletion reflects interference
with the cell cycle.
We suggest that VRK1 is a potential therapeutic
target for treatment of HCC, based on its levels in our
clinical samples and its role in cell proliferation. It has also
been proposed that in lung cancer and rhabdomyosarcoma,
the VRK1 gene is a “druggable target gene” whose function
in tumors is distinguishable from that in healthy tissue
[26, 30]. In the present study, the VRK1 inhibitor luteolin
effectively inhibited HCC cell proliferation. Although
several kinase inhibitors have been shown to suppress
VRK1 kinase activity, the inhibitory mechanism has not
been determined [31]. Our group recently reported that
luteolin specifically binds to the catalytic domain of VRK1
to inhibit the kinase activity [32]. By inhibiting VRK1,
luteolin reduced HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and
also induced apoptosis in HCC cells (Fig. 5C). Consistent
with our results, the anti-cancer effects of luteolin have also
been demonstrated in several HCC cell lines. For example,
luteolin inhibited HGF-induced HepG2 cell invasion and
mediated increases in intracellular ROS levels in Huh-7
cells [33, 34]. In the present study, however, we did not
observe significant induction of apoptosis upon VRK1
depletion by VRK1 siRNA (Sup. Fig. 4). The extent of
its different effect on apoptotic induction between VRK1
inhibition with luteolin treatment and VRK1 depletion by
VRK1 siRNA could be explained by multiple molecular
target of luteolin [24] or/and the residual VRK1 expression
in cells transfected with VRK1 siRNAs. Addressing this
issue will require development of more specific and potent
inhibitors of VRK1.
Aberrant VRK1 expression has been reported in
colon cancer and lung cancer tissues [26, 35]. Similarly,
30143

we observed higher levels of VRK1 in HCC tumor tissue
and cell lines than in corresponding non-tumorous liver
tissue and normal liver cells (Fig. 1A and Fig. 7E). VRK1
expression is known to be dependent on the p53 status.
Induction of p53 expression using UV light or transfection
with the plasmid encoding p53 downregulated VRK1
levels, which is consistent with the inverse correlation
between VRK1 and p53 levels reported previously [12].
Moreover, VRK1 accumulated in lung tumors expressing
mutant p53 with an altered regulatory loop [16]. In
contrast to those earlier reports, we did not find an inverse
correlation between VRK1 and p53 levels in HCC cell
lines (Fig. 1A and Table 1); nonetheless, the regulation
of VRK1 expression by p53 was apparent. For example,
VRK1 levels were reduced by ectopic expression of p53 in
HCC cells (Sup. Fig. 1), and VRK1 increased the stability
of p53 by phosphorylating it on Thr 18, which inhibits p53
binding to mdm2 [10, 36]. On the other hand, we detected
no significant change in p53 levels in response to VRK1
depletion in HCC cells (Fig. 4A). Under our experimental
conditions, the cells were not physiologically stressed,
which may make it more difficult to detect changes in p53
levels related to VRK1 depletion.
An association between stronger VRK1 expression
with shorter OS was previously observed in patients with
estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [20]. KaplanMeier survival analysis showed that HCC patients
expressing high levels of VRK1 likely experience shorter
times of OS and DFS and a higher incidence of recurrence.
A high VRK1 level was found to be a significant risk
factor for recurrence, as were other common prognostic
factors, including Edmonson grade, tumor size and tumor
stage. In addition, moderate hazard ratios for OS and DFS
were also found. It is noteworthy that the multivariate
Cox analysis suggested that the VRK1 level could be
an independent prognostic factor for recurrence with
borderline significance (P = 0.056).
In sum, we found that VRK1 is up-regulated in
HCC, and its increased expression is associated with
poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that
depletion of VRK1 leads to G1 arrest and inhibition of
HCC cell proliferation. In addition, VRK1 depletion may
suppress cyclin D1 expression by downregulating CCND1
transcription and activating p21 and p27 expression.
Notably, luteolin, a VRK1 inhibitor, suppresses HCC
tumor growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing
cell death. Taken together, these findings suggest that high
VRK1 levels could potentially serve as an indicator of
poor prognosis and/or a therapeutic target in HCC.

(Korea). SH-J1 cells were provided by Dr. Dae-Ghon
Kim (Medical School, Chonbuk National University)
[37]. HCC cells were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO2 in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. THLE-2 cell line
was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(USA). THLE-2 cells originated from human primary
normal liver cells were plated on culture plates pre-coated
with a solution containing 0.01 mg/mL fibronectin, 0.03
mg/mL bovine collagen type I and 0.01 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin dissolved in Bronchial Epithelium Basal
Medium (BEBM, Lonza). THLE-2 cells were cultured at
37°C under 5% CO2 in BEBM supplemented with BEGM
SingleQuots (Lonza).
The effects of VRK1 overexpression or depletion on
proliferation were measured using WST-1 assays. Culture
medium was exchanged with medium containing WST-1
reagent (Roche, 1:10 final dilution) at 0 and 72 h after
transfection. After incubating cells for 90 min at 37°C,
absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate
reader (Spectrafluor Plus, Tecan). The effect of luteolin
on HCC cells was also assessed using WST-1 assays.
Cells were plated and incubated in medium containing
various concentrations of luteolin (30, 40 and 50 μM).
After 24 h of treatment, the medium was replaced with
medium containing WST-1 reagent, and the cells were
incubated for 1 h at 37°C.

Colony formation assay
Cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs.
After 24 h of transfection, the cells were seeded at
a density of 2 × 103 cells per well in 6-well dishes
and transfected again 5 days later. Ten days after the
initial transfection, cells were fixed for 5 min with 4%
formaldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS, and stained
for 1 h with 0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol. Plates
were then washed with PBS to remove excessive dye and
photographed with a digital camera. Quantitative changes
in clonogenicity were determined by extracting colonies
with 20% acetic acid and measuring the absorbance at
595 nm. For stable cell lines, 2 × 103 cells were plated,
and cells were fixed and stained 10 days after plating.

HCC cells using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, and reversely transcribed
to cDNA using MMLV reverse transcriptase and the
oligo(dT) primer kit (Solgent). Actin was used as the
control gene. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR
Green I (Takara) and a Light-Cycler rapid thermal cycler
(Roche Diagnostics). The primer sequences are shown

cells. Luteolin and nocodazole were purchased from
Santa Cruz and Sigma Aldrich, respectively.

Establishment of stable cell lines
Stable cell lines were established by transduction
with lentiviral shRNA targeting VRK1 or scrambled
control (Sigma). SK-Hep1 cells (1 × 105) were seeded
onto 6-well plates and infected with lentiviral particles
containing scrambled control shRNA or VRK1 shRNA
clones 1 to 5 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2
in DMEM containing 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) in
each well. After 1 day, the DMEM containing lentivirus
was replaced with growth medium, and the cells were
incubated for an additional 1 day. Puromycin (2 μg/ml;
Invitrogen) was added to each well to select for cells
expressing shRNA. Knockdown efficiency in each
stable cell line was confirmed by Western blot analysis
performed 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks after viral transduction
(Fig. 2A and Sup. Fig. 2). The target sequences of the five
shRNA clones are shown in Supplementary Table 4.

Western Blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [41] using following antibodies: mouse antiVRK1 (Santa Cruz, sc-271062), goat anti-actin (Santa Cruz,
sc-1615), rabbit anti-cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz, sc-753), rabbit
anti-cyclin D2 (Santa Cruz, sc-181), rabbit anti-CREB
(Cell signaling, 9198), rabbit anti-p-CREB (Cell signaling,
9191), rabbit anti-p27 (Santa Cruz, sc-528), mouse anti-p21
(Santa Cruz, sc-6246), rabbit anti-p-RbS795(Cell signaling,
9301), mouse anti-p53 (Santa Cruz, sc-126) and rabbit
anti-p-RbS807/S811(Cell signaling, 9308).

Xenograft assay

Apoptosis was measured using a FITC Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, 556547). HCC
cells were treated with selected concentrations of luteolin
or transfected with the indicated siRNAs and stained with
propodium iodide (PI) and Annexin-V FITC. The stained
cells were analyzed using the Canto II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).

Five-week-old male nude mice were purchased from
Orient Bio (Korea) and raised in a specific pathogen-free
area within the animal facilities at POSTECH (Korea). All
animals were handled according to Institutional Animal
Care and Use guidelines of POSTECH. To compare tumor
growth between established stable SK-Hep1 cell lines
in vivo, 2 weeks after viral transduction, the established
cells (5 × 106) were resuspended in serum-free DMEM with
Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences)
at a 1:1 ratio (total volume, 100 μl) and subcutaneously
injected into the right and left flanks of nude mice. Tumor
sizes were measured every 2 weeks using the Vernier
caliper, and volumes were determined according to the
formula L × S2 × 0.52, where L is the longest diameter and
S the shortest diameter of the tumor. Mice were sacrificed
8 weeks after injection and the solid tumors isolated.
The effect of luteolin on tumor growth in vivo was
assessed using the method described previously [42]
with minor modification. SK-Hep1 cells (1 × 107) were
resuspended in serum-free DMEM with Matrigel basement
membrane matrix (BD Biosciences) at a 1:1 ratio (total
volume, 100 μl) and subcutaneously injected into the
right flank of nude mice. Mice were then intraperitoneally
administered vehicle or luteolin (20 mg/kg/d) daily from
2 weeks after inoculation. The body weight and tumor size
of each mouse were measured and tumor volumes were
determined according to the formula L × S2 × 0.52, where
L is the longest diameter and S the shortest diameter of
the tumor.

Cell cycle analysis
To analyze the progression of the cell cycle on
asynchronous cell populations, 8 × 105 cells were seeded
onto 6-well plates, transiently transfected with negative
control or VRK1-specific siRNA and grown for 24 h. Cells
were then collected by trypsinization, fixed in the fixation
solution containing 70% ethanol and 0.5% Tween-20,
washed in PBS containing 1% BSA, resuspended in 200 μl
PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) and 50 μg/mL
propidium iodide (Sigma), incubated in the dark for 40 min
at room temperature, and analyzed using the Canto II flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). Acquired data were analyzed
using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House).
To synchronize the cells at G2/M phase, cells were
exposed to nocodazole (50 ng/ml) at 24 h after transfection.
After the indicated exposure times (Fig. 3C), flow cytometry
were performed using the same procedure described above.

patients who had undergone curative resection of primary
HCCs between 1995 and 2007 at the Ajou Medical
Center in Korea. The clinicopathological data for the
88 patients, which are summarized in Supplementary
Table 1, were almost entirely available in the medical
records. Exceptions were the HBV status in one case,
HCV status in two cases and AFP level in one case. BCLC
stage, tumor stage, and Edmondson and Steiner grades
were used according to published criteria. Liver function
was preserved in all patients, and no patients died within
2 months after surgery in the current cohort. The median
follow-up time was 23.47 months (range, 1.15–134.30) for
recurrence and DFS and 47.77 months (range, 2.01–193.68)
for OS. Recurrence was defined as the first appearance of
new lesions at any site after surgery, as confirmed using
radiologic imaging. Patients who underwent local therapy,
including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and
radiofrequency ablation, were not included. Fresh tumors
and surrounding normal tissues were partly snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen immediately after hepatectomy and
stored at −80°C. The study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the Ajou Medical Center.

PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, incubated with Hoechst
33342 (Invitrogen) for 2 min at room temperature and
mounted with Mounting medium (Dako).

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining
Liver and tumor tissues from mice were fixed and
embedded in paraffin and ~4-μm-thick were prepared.
The sections were stained with H&E as described
previously [44].

Statistical analysis
Relations between VRK1 protein levels and
clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated using
χ2 and Fisher’s exact tests. Tumor recurrence, OS and
DFS were compared between VRK1-high and VRK1-low
groups using the Kaplan–Meier method, and significant
differences in curves was assessed using the log-rank
test. Results of the WST-1 and colony forming assays,
weight and volume of tumors, immunofluorescence
intensities and real time RT-PCR were analyzed using
Student’s t test. Cox regression analysis was performed to
evaluate the prognostic significance of clinicopathological
parameters and VRK1 expression. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant, and data marked with a
one (*), two (**) or three (***) asterisks indicate P values
of < 0.05, < 0.01 and < 0.001, respectively. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS v. 18.0 (IBM) and
the open source statistical program R v 3.1.1.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical detection of VRK1 in
patient samples was performed using formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded tissue sections (~4 μm thick). After
deparaffinization in xylene for 15 min, rehydrated tissue
sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by boiling in
Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) for 5 min. Slides were then
incubated with rabbit anti-VRK1 (Santa Cruz) for 1 h
at room temperature, and the VRK1 antigen-antibody
reaction was detected using a Real Detection System
(Dako, K5001). Immunohistochemical intensity of VRK1
staining was evaluated by two independent pathologists.
VRK1 expression was evaluated in 10 high-power fields
(400 ×). In each sample, intensity was classified as
0 (negative staining), 1 (<5% staining), 2 (<25% staining),
3 (25–50% staining) and 4 (>50% staining),  and  the
average intensity assessed. Immunohistochemical
detection of Ki-67 in mouse tumors treated with luteolin
was also performed using the same method described
above with mouse anti-Ki-67 (Dako, M7240) antibody.
