Abstract
The Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates fundamental processes in normal and malignant cells, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell
survival. Mutations in this pathway have been associated with
carcinogenesis and developmental disorders, making Mek1
and Mek2 prime therapeutic targets. In this study, we
examined the requirement for Mek1 and Mek2 in skin
neoplasia using the two-step 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthraacene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (DMBA/TPA)
skin carcinogenesis model. Mice lacking epidermal Mek1
protein develop fewer papillomas than both wild-type and
Mek2-null mice following DMBA/TPA treatment. Mek1 knockout mice had smaller papillomas, delayed tumor onset, and
half the tumor burden of wild-type mice. Loss of one Mek1
allele, however, did not affect tumor development, indicating
that one Mek1 allele is sufficient for normal papilloma
formation. No difference in TPA-induced hyperproliferation,
inflammation, or Erk activation was observed between wildtype, conditional Mek1 knockout, and Mek2 -null mice,
indicating that Mek1 findings were not due to a general
failure of these processes. These data show that Mek1 is
important for skin tumor development and that Mek2 cannot
compensate for the loss of Mek1 function in this setting.

Introduction
About 30% of all human tumors exhibit increased signaling
through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,
which has accordingly become a target for anticancer therapy
(1, 2). This finding is more pronounced in epithelial squamous cell
carcinomas (SCC), the majority of which exhibit Ras GTPase
activation and MAPK cascade hyperactivation (3, 4). Ras exerts its
effects through downstream effector pathways that classically
include the Raf/Mek/Erk MAPK cascade, type I phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases, and Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(RalGEF), along with a host of additional pathways (5). In mammals,
the best-characterized Ras effector pathway is the MAPK cascade,
which includes Raf (Raf1, B-Raf, and A-Raf), Mek (Mek1 and Mek2),
and Erk (Erk1 and Erk2). This classic Erk MAPK cascade plays major
roles in development, homeostasis, and cancer, with the former
shown by the involvement of numerous cascade components in an

array of related hereditary disorders, including Costello, Noonan,
and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes (6). The Erk MAPK cascade
signaling involves a host of scaffolding and regulatory mediators,
such as KSR, MP1, RKIP, IQGAP1, and MORG1, which promote
activation of specific Erk targets among the >160 known effector
proteins to affect a pleiotropic array of cellular functions, including
proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration (7, 8).
In epidermis, Ras and Raf promote proliferation and oppose
differentiation, although it is unclear to what extent Mek1 and
Mek2 individually are responsible for these activities. The Mek
isoforms share 85% sequence identity and have a similar ability
to phosphorylate Erk1 and Erk2. Despite their similarity, however,
the function of Mek1 and Mek2 may not be entirely redundant,
as evidenced by the death of Mek1 / mice in early gestation (9)
and the phenotypic normality of Mek2 / mice (10). Interestingly,
Mek1 conditional ablation in the embryo proper results in viable
mice, demonstrating that Mek1 is required solely for extraembryonic ectoderm formation (11). The only complete knockout at one
level of the Erk MAPK cascade thus far, achieved by combined
deletion of Mek1 and Mek2 in mouse skin, resulted in perinatal
death (12). Similarly, in adult mice, inducible deletion of Mek1/2
caused apoptosis of the epidermis and lethality, indicating that
Mek function is also required for survival during adulthood.
Likewise, regenerated human epidermal tissue depleted of both
Mek isoforms via RNA interference exhibited hypoproliferation and
hypoplasia (12). In contrast, expression of constitutively active
forms of H-Ras, Raf1, or Mek1, in mouse as well as human skin,
promotes proliferation and hyperplasia (13, 14). Expression of
constitutively active Mek2, however, has no effect, suggesting that
although Mek1 and Mek2 are redundant in many settings, their
spectra of action in tissues such as epidermis may not be identical.
In epidermal tissue, Ras has been most extensively studied in the
context of murine tumorigenesis. Data generated from an array of
murine genetic models, including classical 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)annthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (DMBA/TPA)
multistage skin carcinogenesis, indicate that Ras plays a pivotal
role in initiating SCC development (15). More than 90% of the skin
cancers initiated with DMBA contain the Ha-Ras activating transversion A ! T at the second nucleotide of codon 61. Consistent
with this, H-Ras–null mice developed f6-fold fewer papillomas
than wild-type mice in the DMBA/TPA tumor model (16). Recently,
mutations in Mek1 associated with human cancers were described
(17, 18). These data point to Ras and its downstream effectors as
important elements in epidermal neoplasia and potential targets of
clinical relevance.
Here, we investigated the effects of loss of Mek1 or Mek2
on induction of epidermal neoplasia in vivo using the DMBA/
TPA two-stage skin carcinogenesis model. We show that loss of
Mek1 reduced tumor formation but loss of Mek2 did not. Thus,

Mek1 and Mek2 in Epidermal Neoplasia

Figure 1. Induction of skin neoplasia in wild-type, Mek1, and Mek2 mutant mice. Skin-restricted Mek1 knockout mice (Mek1fl/flCre ; A ) and Mek2 knockout mice
(Mek2/; B) were subjected to the DMBA/TPA two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. A and B, average number of papillomas per mouse, n = 5. Mice were
euthanized at wk 20 due to the large tumor burden. *, P < 0.02.

Mek1 is selectively required during the early stages of epidermal
tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Mice and skin carcinogenesis protocol. Mek2 /, Mek1fl/fl , and Mek1 D/+
mice were maintained in a 129/SvEv background (10, 11). K14-Cre
transgenic mice in a CD-1 background were obtained from Elaine Fuchs,
Rockefeller University, New York (19); this line was then backcrossed to
129/SvEv mice, but animals derived from crosses with K14-Cre animals still
had some CD-1 background. Littermates were used for experiments. Mice
were housed and bred under standard conditions with food and water
ad libitum and were maintained on a 12-h dark/light cycle. All experiments
were approved by the Stanford University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Mouse genotyping was performed as previously described (12). The backs of
8- to 10-wk-old mice were shaved and treated with a single application of
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA, Sigma; 10 Ag in 100 AL acetone)
followed by twice weekly application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-

acetate (TPA, Sigma: 12.5 Ag in 100 AL acetone) for 20 wk. The number and
sizes (mm) of papillomas were recorded once a week. The animals were
sacrificed after 20 wk of TPA promotion.
Epidermal hyperplasia. TPA-induced acute hyperplasia was evaluated
in wild-type, Mek1fl/flCre, and Mek2 / animals 8 to 10 wk of age after
96-h treatment with 12.5 Ag TPA in 100 AL acetone or vehicle (acetone)
alone applied to the previously shaved dorsal skin.
Western blots. For immunoblotting, epidermal skin extract was
obtained by incubating the dorsal skin in 1:1 dispase/PBS (Invitrogen) at
37jC for 3 h. The epidermis was lysed in lysis buffer and run on Western
blots as previously described (12). For papilloma analysis, tissue was
grinded and lysed in lysis buffer. Antibodies used for immunoblotting
were rabbit anti–phospho-p44/42 MAPK (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technologies), rabbit anti–p44/42 MAPK (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technologies), rabbit
anti-Mek1 (1: 1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), rabbit anti-Mek2 (1: 1,000,
Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), mouse anti-actin (1:20,000, Sigma-Aldrich),
donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP;
1:40,000, Amersham Biosciences), and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated
HRP (1:40,000, Amersham Biosciences).

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Dorsal skin of adult mice
was dissected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (accutain; SigmaAldrich), and embedded in paraffin, from which 5-Am sections were cut and
stained with H&E or by immunohistochemistry according to standard
methods. Permeabilization for antigen retrieval was achieved by microwaving samples in Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories), after
which the sections were stained with rabbit anti–phospho-Akt (1:150) and
rabbit anti–phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (1:600, Cell Signalling Technologies) as
primary antibodies and biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG as secondary
antibody (RTU Vectastain Universal Elite ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories).
Staining and development were performed using the Elite ABC Reagent
(Vector Laboratories) and DakoCytomation liquid DAB+ substrate chromogen system (Dako). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and
PBS blueing. A minimum of three papillomas was analyzed per genotype.
Microscopy. H&E-stained sections were viewed using a DM LB
microscope (Leica) with either a 5 Leica N Plan 1/A, 10 Leica N Plan
1/A, or 20 Leica HC PL Fluotar 1/0.17 objective. Images were captured
using a SPOT Insight QE camera and SPOT 4.5.9.12 software (Diagnostic
Instruments, Inc.).
Statistics. Post hoc analyses using Student’s t test and m2 test were used.

Results
Disruption of Mek1, but not of Mek2, decreases tumor
burden. To address the role of Mek1 and Mek2 in skin papilloma
development, we generated mice deficient in either of these genes.
Because Mek1 knockout mice display embryonic lethality, Mek1
conditional knockout mice were generated. To conditionally ablate

Mek1 in skin, we crossed floxed Mek1 mice (Mek1fl/fl ) to keratin
14-Cre transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase specifically
in stratified epithelia, including the skin. In a previous study, the
expression of Mek1 in mouse skin was assessed, which confirmed
efficient Cre-mediated disruption of Mek1 (12). To study Mek2, we
used Mek2 knockout animals because these are viable (10). We
subjected cohorts of Mek1fl/fl, Mek1fl/flCre, Mek2 +/+, Mek2 +/, and
Mek2 / adult mice to two-step skin carcinogenesis. Mice were
exposed to one treatment of DMBA followed by 20 weeks of twiceweekly TPA treatment, and the number and size of papillomas
that developed during this period were assessed. In Mek1fl/fl mice,
the onset of papillomas was at 9 weeks and these papillomas grew
progressively larger throughout the treatment period. At the end
of the study, these mice each had an average of 24 papillomas. In
contrast, Mek1fl/flCre mice lacking Mek1 expression in the skin
exhibited a 1-week delay in the onset of papillomas and developed
fewer papillomas (Fig. 1A). When the animals were euthanized, the
average number of papillomas in the Mek1-deficient animals was
2-fold less than that of wild-type mice. However, no significant
difference was seen between Mek2 +/+, Mek2 +/, and Mek2 / mice.
Papillomas began to appear in all groups at about the same time,
9 weeks after treatment initiation, and their growth rates were
similar (Fig. 1B).
To further investigate the role of Mek1 in papilloma formation,
both in the skin and in other tissues, we used Mek1 heterozygous
mice (Mek1fl/D ), which express only one Mek1 allele in all tissues

Mek1 and Mek2 in Epidermal Neoplasia

(11), crossing them to floxed Mek1 mice and Cre transgenic mice.
Further, we aimed to test whether loss of one Mek1 allele would be
sufficient to lower the tumor occurrence in the DMBA/TPA tumor
model, because the breeding setup of the previous experiment
did not allow the investigation of Mek1 heterozygous mice. The
same two-stage carcinogenesis model was applied to the following
mouse groups: Mek1fl/+, Mek1fl/+Cre, Mek1fl/D , and Mek1fl/DCre.
Similar to the previously described conditional Mek1 knockout
mice (Mek1fl/flCre), Mek1fl/DCre animals had a 1-week delay in
tumor onset and a 2-fold reduction in tumor burden at the end of
the experiment, compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, both groups of mice heterozygous for the Mek1 allele
(Mek1fl/+Cre, Mek1fl/D ) developed as many papillomas as did wildtype mice, indicating that one copy of Mek1 is sufficient to
facilitate papilloma development. Further, the effect of loss of one
Mek1 allele in all tissues, skin and non-skin, is equivalent to that of
skin-specific Mek1 knockout, suggesting that the Mek1 functions
involved in papilloma formation take place in the skin.
Next, we analyzed the size of DMBA/TPA–induced papillomas.
Both types of conditional Mek1 knockout mice, Mek1fl/flCre and
Mek1fl/DCre, had not only fewer tumors but also smaller tumors,
compared with controls (Fig. 2B). This trend was seen from the
onset of papilloma formation. At 20 weeks postinitiation, these
knockout mice had 1.2- to 1.5-fold fewer 1- to 3-mm tumors, 4- to
8-fold fewer 4- to 7-mm tumors, and no tumor larger than that. All
the other genotypes averaged at least one tumor z8 mm (Table 1).
The deletion of Mek2 did not significantly affect papilloma number

www.aacrjournals.org

or size. Thus, one Mek1 allele seems to be sufficient for papilloma
formation in the DMBA/TPA tumor model.
Tumors from wild-type, conditional Mek1 knockout mice,
and Mek2-null mice are benign and well differentiated. The
difference in papilloma number and size between wild-type and
Mek1-deficient mice throughout the 20-week course of DMBA/TPA
treatment suggests that Mek1 is important not only for papilloma
initiation but also for efficient development (Fig. 3A and B). The
gross appearance of DMBA/TPA–treated mice at 16 and 20 weeks
of TPA promotion clearly depicts the difference between tumor
burden in wild-type, Mek1, and Mek2 knockout animals, with Mek1
knockout animals displaying fewer and smaller tumors. However,
there was no obvious difference between genotypes in the
histologic appearance of the papillomas (Fig. 3C). All papillomas
were benign and well differentiated; none of them progressed to
malignant carcinoma during the 20-week experiment.
Phospho-Erk1/2 and phospho-Akt levels are not genotype
dependent. To determine the effects of Mek1 and Mek2 ablation
in skin papilloma development, we investigated activation of major
effector pathways downstream of oncogenic Ras. Despite the loss
of two Mek alleles, epidermal extract of skin-restricted Mek1
knockout mice as well as that of Mek2-null mice showed levels of
Erk1/2 and phospho-Erk1/2 protein equivalent to that of wild-type
epidermal extract (Fig. 4A). No compensatory changes in Mek
isoform expression were seen upon loss of Mek1 or Mek2,
consistent with previous findings (9, 10, 12). Further, immunohistochemical analyses of phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk1/2 in

papillomas did not reveal any significant differences in expression
level of either protein between wild type, Mek1, and Mek2 knockout
mice (Fig. 4B). To address isoform-specific activation of Erk1/2, we
analyzed the levels of phospho-Erk1 and phospho-Erk2 by Western
blotting. Two papilloma extracts for each genotype were analyzed
and no significant changes were seen (Fig. 4C). Thus, Mek1
knockout animals had fewer tumors, but these tumors did not
display altered phospho-Erk1, phospho-Erk2, or phospho-Akt levels
compared with Mek2 knockout and wild-type papillomas.
The epidermal hyperplasia and Erk activation induced by
TPA or DMBA/TPA treatment is not affected by loss of Mek1 or
Mek2. Decreased papilloma induction in Mek1 knockout mice
could be due to a global proliferation defect caused by Mek1 loss,
which would cause Mek1 knockout cells to undergo less DMBA/
TPA–induced proliferation. To address the individual roles of Mek1
and Mek2 during stress-induced epidermal proliferation, skin was
treated with TPA or vehicle (acetone) alone. The phorbol ester TPA
induces a robust proliferative response leading to substantial
epidermal hyperplasia. After four daily topical treatments of TPA,
wild-type mouse skin exhibited marked hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. The effect of TPA on Mek1fl/flCre and Mek2 / mouse skin
was similar, with no obvious difference in cell proliferation or cell
death seen (Fig. 5A). Further, as observed in other studies of TPA
treatment, epidermal inflammation was noted; however, it did not
vary in extent histologically with respect to mouse genotype. These

data indicate that Mek1 is not required for hyperplasia or
inflammation in response to TPA treatment.
To further confirm the absence of differential responses to TPA
by Mek1 and Mek2 knockout skin, we assessed the effect of a TPA
treatment regimen identical to that used in tumorigenesis experiments. Specifically, wild-type, Mek1fl/flCre, and Mek2 / mice were
treated with DMBA followed by 2 weeks of twice-weekly TPA
treatment, at which point the skin was harvested. Similar to the
short-term TPA treatment studies, no differences were observed
among all three genotypes in the extent of TPA-induced
hyperplasia or epidermal inflammation (Fig. 5B). Finally, immunoblotting of epidermal protein extract prepared from skin harvested
at this time point confirmed no significant differences in Erk1 or
Erk2 activation among the three genotypes (Fig. 5C). Thus,
alterations in response to TPA do not appear to underlie the effect
of Mek1 or Mek2 knockout on DMBA/TPA–induced tumorigenesis
in mice.

Discussion
Here, we have used genetically engineered knockout mice to
examine the roles of Mek1 and Mek2 in a two-stage skin
carcinogenesis model. Whereas knockout of Mek2 or deletion of
one Mek1 allele had no effect on the number or size of induced
papillomas, loss of both Mek1 alleles delayed papilloma onset and
resulted in smaller and fewer tumors.

The overlapping and unique functions of isoforms at each level
of the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway are just beginning to be
elucidated. Often, no distinction is made between the functions of
Mek1 and Mek2 or Erk1 and Erk2, and few studies have examined
the individual contributions of each isoform to biological
processes. The only identified Mek1 and Mek2 substrates are
Erk1 and Erk2, which are phosphorylated by Mek1 and Mek2. It is
clear from previous genetic studies that Mek1 and Mek2 are
functionally redundant in some contexts (12). Mice expressing only
one of their four Mek1 or Mek2 alleles in the skin are viable and
fertile irrespective of whether the remaining allele is Mek1 or Mek2,
demonstrating that Mek1 and Mek2 do not have distinct roles for
normal skin homeostasis.

www.aacrjournals.org

These prior studies, however, focused primarily on Mek
functions in development and tissue homeostasis. In contrast,
our findings here suggest that Mek1 plays a unique role in tumor
development. This distinguishing role of Mek1 is in accordance
with the requirement of Mek1 specifically for extraembryonic
ectoderm formation (11), cancer cell line colony formation (20),
and with our previous demonstration that activation of Mek1, but
not of Mek2, induces skin hyperplasia (13). Interestingly, in the
latter study, we found that constitutively active forms of Mek1 and
Mek2 activated Erk1/2 similarly, although only active Mek1
induced hyperplasia. Similarly, we find in the present study that
Mek1 and Mek2 knockout mice display equivalent levels of Erk1/2
phosphorylation upon DMBA/TPA treatment. Furthermore, in

another study, we find that activation of oncogenic Ras in mouse
skin containing only two of the four Mek1/2 alleles produces
equivalent hyperplasia and Erk1/2 phosphorylation regardless of
whether the remaining alleles are both Mek1, both Mek2, or one of
each isoform (21). Together, these results suggest that differential
expression of Mek- and Erk-interacting proteins, and not different
levels of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, may underlie the difference in
tumorigenesis in Mek1 and Mek2 knockout mice. For instance, it
has been shown that the binding partner interactions of Erk1/2,
including homodimerization and binding to scaffold proteins, can
alter the ability of Erk1/2 to activate their substrates, independent
of their own phosphorylation state (22). Furthermore, two new
studies hint toward a crucial role of subcellular localization and
differential use of scaffolding proteins to regulate the biological
outcome of MAPK activation (23, 24). Future experiments should
therefore investigate differential expression and localization of
proteins that modulate activity of MAPK cascade activity in the
settings of Mek1 and Mek2 loss. Alternatively, it is possible that
our present experiments did not detect a difference in Erk1/2
activity between Mek1 and Mek2 knockout mice because a
difference appeared only during the initial response of the skin
to DMBA treatment, when Mek1 knockout cells may have been
more susceptible than Mek2 knockout cells to genotoxic stress,
thereby incurring higher rates of apoptosis and leading to the
differential tumor burden in these knockout mice.
Interestingly, we found that Mek1 and Mek2 knockout animals
responded similarly to TPA treatment, which induced both
inflammation and hyperplasia. This result contrasts with recent
studies of Erk1 knockout animals, which exhibit reduced hyperproliferation in response to TPA alone, but are, similar to
conditional Mek1 knockout animals, resistant to DMBA/TPA–

induced tumorigenesis, having half the tumor burden and tumors
of smaller size than those of wild-type littermates (25). Like Mek1
knockout animals, Erk1 knockout mice are viable, fertile, and of
normal size. In contrast to Mek1 knockout mice, however, Erk1
knockout mice exhibit disrupted thymocyte maturation and
proliferation, as well as local cutaneous lesions and hyperplastic
skin. Future efforts to assess the effects of Erk2 knockout on
DMBA/TPA–induced tumorigenesis will be important to determine
whether the role of Erk1 in tumorigenesis, like the role of Mek1,
is isoform specific.
In summary, we have shown that Mek1 function is important for
the early stages of skin tumor formation and that Mek2 cannot
compensate for its absence. Additional studies will be required to
understand how these two isoforms differ on a mechanistic level.
Understanding the individual contributions of Mek1 and Mek2, as
well as those of their downstream targets Erk1 and Erk2, to normal
biological processes and pathogenesis will be important in further
evaluating these genes as potential therapeutic targets.
