Abstract
Epidemiological data clearly establishes cigarette smoking as one of the major
cause for lung cancer worldwide. Recently, targeted therapy has become one of the
most preferred modes of treatment for cancer. Though certain targeted therapies
such as anti-EGFR are in clinical practice, they have shown limited success in lung
cancer patients who are smokers. This demands discovery of alternative drug targets
through systematic investigation of cigarette smoke-induced signaling mechanisms.
To study the signaling events activated in response to cigarette smoke, we carried out
SILAC-based phosphoproteomic analysis of H358 lung cancer cells chronically exposed
to cigarette smoke. We identified 1,812 phosphosites, of which 278 phosphosites were
hyperphosphorylated (≥ 3-fold) in H358 cells chronically exposed to cigarette smoke.
Our data revealed hyperphosphorylation of S560 within the conserved kinase domain
of PAK6. Activation of PAK6 is associated with various processes in cancer including
metastasis. Mechanistic studies revealed that inhibition of PAK6 led to reduction
in cell proliferation, migration and invasion of the cigarette smoke treated cells.
Further, siRNA mediated silencing of PAK6 resulted in decreased invasive abilities
in a panel of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Consistently, mice bearing
tumor xenograft showed reduced tumor growth upon treatment with PF-3758309

(group II PAK inhibitor). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed overexpression of
PAK6 in 66.6% (52/78) of NSCLC cases in tissue microarrays. Taken together, our
study indicates that PAK6 is a promising novel therapeutic target for NSCLC, especially
in smokers.

Introduction

We identified a total of 3,624 phosphopeptides
corresponding to 1,812 unique phosphosites and 1,086
proteins. Out of these, 278 phosphosites were found to
be hyperphosphorylated (≥ 3-fold) in H358 cells exposed
to cigarette smoke. The hyperphosphorylated proteins
identified in our data includes p21 protein activated kinase
6 (PAK6) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
amongst others. In this study, we investigated the role of
PAK6 in NSCLC. PAKs are involved in various processes
including cell proliferation, survival, motility and are
the major downstream effectors of Rho GTPase proteins
including cdc42 and Rac1 [18, 19]. PAK4, 5 and 6 belong
to the group II of PAKs which lack auto-inhibitory domain
present in group I PAKs. Though previous reports have
shown the overexpression of PAK6 in multiple cancers
including prostate cancer, breast cancer and in hepatocellular
carcinoma, there are limited studies investigating the
signaling mechanism of PAK6 in cancer [20, 21]. In
this study, we assessed the potential of PAK6 as a novel
therapeutic target in NSCLC especially among smokers.

Lung cancer accounts for ~19% of the cancer related
deaths worldwide [1]. The 5 year survival rate is only 15%
for patients diagnosed with lung cancer in the advanced
stage [2]. Approximately 85% of the lung cancers are
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [3]. Smoking is one
of the major risk factors for NSCLC [4, 5]. NSCLC in
smokers presents distinct molecular signatures compared
to lung cancer from non-smokers [6, 7].
Anti-EGFR therapy such as gefitinib and erlotinib
are currently in practice for treatment of NSCLC. Though,
these drugs have shown marked the efficacy in non-smokers,
smokers seem to be largely resistant [7]. Studies have shown
that smokers acquire distinct EGFR mutations [8]. Smoke
exposure also leads to aberrant phosphorylation of EGFR and
downstream signaling that confers TKI-resistance in smokers
[9]. Identification of novel agents that can act as therapeutic
targets in such patients remains a challenge. In small
percentage of NSCLC patients, targeted therapies that inhibit
EML4-ALK or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)
are effective [10]. Dysregulation in other key signaling
pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MAPK and
MET kinase have been reported as potential targets but are
pending clinical validation. These observations accentuate
the need for systematic investigation of alternative signaling
pathways that are activated upon chronic exposure to smoke.
To understand the aberrant signaling in smokers in
lung cancer, we developed a cell - based model, where lung
cancer cell line H358, was chronically exposed to cigarette
smoke condensate (CSC). Investigators have studied the
effect of cigarette smoke at high dose and short exposure on
lung cells [11–14]. However, clinical data has established
that chronic cigarette smoke exposure and not acute
exposure induce carcinogenesis. The above mentioned
studies have elucidated perturbations in pathways such as
EGFR in response to acute exposure to cigarette smoke. To
date, there are limited studies addressing effect of chronic
exposure of cigarette smoke in lung cells, even though
smoking remains the primary risk factor for NSCLC.
Phosphoproteomics has emerged as a powerful
tool to understand the global alterations in the signaling
pathways [15, 16]. Further, for reliable quantitation of the
phosphoproteome, SILAC, an in vivo proteome labeling
technique has become a preferred choice [17]. We carried out
high resolution mass spectrometry-based analysis to identify
aberrantly activated signaling pathways in lung cancer by
chronic cigarette smoke exposure. SILAC coupled with
affinity-based enrichment of phosphopeptides was employed
to identify dysregulated phosphosites upon chronic cigarette
smoke exposure.

Results
Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke leads to
enhanced cell survival
To understand the effects of chronic cigarette
smoke exposure in lung cancer cells, we developed a cell
line model using H358 cells. H358 is a spontaneously
immortalized lung cancer cell line derived from
an in situ adenocarcinoma (earlier nomenclature Bronchioalveolar carcinoma) and is a non to minimally
invasive cell line. The cells lack the ability to grow in
anchorage independent fashion was chosen for the study.
These cells were exposed to CSC (0.1%) for 12 months
and were designated as H358-S [22]. The H358 parental
cells unexposed to smoke were referred as H358-P.
During the course of chronic exposure, we observed
alteration in both morphological (data not shown) and
biological properties of the cells. We observed increased
proliferation and colony formation with H358-S cells
compared to the parental cells (Figure 1A and 1B).
In vitro invasion assays using matrigel showed that the
minimally-invasive H358 cells had acquired increased
invasive property upon chronic cigarette smoke treatment
and more than 80% of the cells had invaded the matrigelcoated PET membrane (Figure 1C). These results
indicate an increase in both proliferative and invasive
potential of H358 cells in response to chronic cigarette
smoke exposure. It is established that genotoxic insults
enable cancer cells escape cell death by regulating the
61230

expression of both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins [23].
Since H358-S cells showed increased colony forming
and invasive ability, we next examined the expression
of BCL-2 family proteins in response to cigarette
smoke. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in
expression of both BCL-XL and BCL-2 in the H358-S
cells compared to the parental cells. The transcription
factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) which can both

suppress and promote apoptosis, showed an increased
expression in the cigarette smoke treated cells. However,
the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX
and PUMA remained unchanged (Figure 1D). These
results indicate that chronic exposure to cigarette smoke
induces cellular transformation and increases the cell
survival by modulating the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic molecules.

Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke induces
widespread perturbation of signaling pathways

corresponding to 1,086 proteins amongst which
278 phosphosites were hyperphosphorylated while 125
were hypophosphorylated (≥ 3-fold) in H358-S cells.
The partial list of hyperphosphorylated sites is shown in
Table 1. The complete list of identified phosphopeptides is
provided in Supplementary Table S1.
Upon chronic cigarette smoke exposure, we
observed hyperphosphorylation of some of the molecules
known to be associated with lung cancer. We observed
hyperphosphorylation of p27 (CDKN1B) at S10 (6.4-fold)

Since cigarette smoke led to an increase in the
proliferation and invasive potential of the cells, we sought
to study the altered signaling pathways in H358-S cells.
We carried out SILAC-based phosphoproteomic analysis
of H358-P and H358-S cells. The work flow is depicted
in Figure 2. High resolution mass spectrometry-based
analysis lead to identification of 1,812 phosphosites

Figure 2: Schematic workflow followed to identify differentially phosphorylated proteome upon chronic exposure to
cigarette smoke. H358-P cells were grown in heavy media enriched with 13C6-Lysine/13C6-Arg while H358-S cells were cultured in light

media (L-Lys/L-Arg). Equal amount of lysate from H358-P and H358-S cells were pooled and subjected to in-solution trypsin digestion,
followed by reversed phase peptide purification and bRPLC fractionation. Phosphopeptide enrichment was carried out using titanium
dioxide followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify differentially phosphorylated proteins.

which is associated with cell motility and inhibition of
apoptosis [24]. MDM2, which is a known regulator of
p53 was found to be hyperphosphorylated at S166. AKTmediated phosphorylation of MDM2 at S166 is known
to increase its interaction with p300, allowing MDM2mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 leading
to cancer progression [25]. These findings support our
observation that cigarette smoke exposure increases the
oncogenic potential of the lung cancer cells.
We also observed hyperphosphorylation of sites
associated with activation of kinases which are known to
play a key role in cancer progression such as EGF receptor
(T693) (7.5-fold). Activation of EGF receptor has been
reported in lung cancer patients who are smokers [9].
We also observed hyperphosphorylation of sites which
are crucial to the activation of kinases such as TAOK3
(S324) (3-fold), MAPK14 (Y182) (12.5-fold), PAK6
(S560) (5.4-fold) and RPS6KA4 (S347) (3-fold). Amongst
group II PAKs, increased expression of PAK4 is associated
with poor prognosis in NSCLC [26, 27]. However, the
expression and biological function of PAK6 in NSCLC
is not known. We identified some of the upstream
activators of PAK6 such as TAOK3 and MAPK14
which were previously reported to be involved in PAK6
signaling. Kaur et al., have reported activation of PAK6 by
MAPK14 and PAK6 was found to be inhibited in presence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of MAPK14 antagonist [28]. Also, in an independent
study, TAOK3 was found to be an upstream regulator of
MAPK14 in response to DNA damage [29]. These findings
indicate that there is widespread modulation of signaling
pathways upon chronic exposure to cigarette smoke
in lung cancer cells. Representative MS and MS/MS
spectra of hyperphosphorylated phosphopeptides from
PAK6 (S560) and TAOK3 (S324) are depicted in Figure 3A
and 3B; MS and MS/MS spectra for MAPK14 (Y182) and
RPS6KA4 (S347) are depicted in Supplementary Figure
S1A and S1B. We also performed motif analysis using
motif-X algorithm to identify enriched motifs among
the hyperphosphorylated phosphopeptides from H358-S
cells [30]. Enriched motifs included, consensus AKT
motif (RxxS) (Supplementary Figure S1C). In agreement
with the motif analysis, Western blot analysis revealed
activation of AKT in H358-S cells compared to H358-P
cells (Figure 3C; lanes 1 and 2; pAKT panel).

AKT mediates PAK6 phosphorylation in NSCLC
exposed to cigarette smoke
Several studies have reported overexpression of
PAK6 in multiple cancers; however its role in lung cancer
is poorly understood. In contrast to group 1 PAK members,
PAK6 kinase activity is not stimulated by CDC42 or RAC
61233

Oncotarget

Inhibition of PAK6 decreases cell motility in
NSCLC cells exposed to cigarette smoke

binding, and therefore the mechanisms that regulate its
kinase activity have also not been studied well. Among
the members of group II family of PAK kinases, PAK4
has been shown to be upstream regulator of AKT [31, 32].
However, there are no reports that have investigated
the crosstalk between PAK6 and AKT signaling. Here,
we explored the potential role of AKT in regulating
PAK6 activity. Akin to the mass spectrometry data, we
observed increased phosphorylation of PAK6 in H358-S
cells (Figure 3C - lanes 1 and 2; pPAK6 panel/band).
To understand if PAK6 mediated signaling in cigarette
smoke treated lung cancer cells is AKT dependent or
independent, we treated the H358-S cells with AKT
inhibitor (LY294002) and group II PAK inhibitor (PF3758309). Inhibition of AKT led to decreased AKT
phosphorylation at S473 in H358-S cells (Figure 3C
–lanes 2 and 4; pAKT panel). We also observed that
inhibition of AKT led to decreased phosphorylation of
PAK6 in H358-S cells (Figure 3C –lanes 2 and 4; pPAK6
panel/band). Alternatively, inhibition of PAK6 using PF3758309, did not affect the phosphorylation of AKT in the
smoke exposed cells (Figure 3C –lanes 2 and 6; pAKT
panel). These results indicate that though PAK6 belongs to
the group II family of PAK kinases, unlike PAK4, PAK6
mediated signaling in smoke treated lung cancer cells is
activated by AKT.

We next studied whether PAK6 has any role in
tumor cell motility. To study this, scratch wound assays
were carried out using H358-P and H358-S cells with or
without PF-3758309. Wounds were made in uniform size
and H358-S cells were treated with PF-3758309. After
incubation for 20 hours, H358-S cells showed increased
migration compared to parental cells. The migratory
capacity of H358-S cells was found to be decreased upon
PAK6 inhibition. The wound photomicrographs were taken
at 0 and 20 hours and distance covered by the cells was
measured using Image J software. Images of the wounds
at 0 and 20 hours are shown and fold changes in cell
migration is depicted in the form of bar graph (Figure 4C).
We observed a similar decrease in H1299 cell migration
upon treatment with PF-3758039 (Supplementary Figure
S2E and S2F). These results indicate that PAK6 plays an
essential role in lung cancer cell migration.

Inhibition of PAK6 decreases the invasive
property of NSCLC cells
Since inhibition of PAK6 led to a decrease in the
migration of lung cancer cells chronically exposed to
cigarette smoke, we next studied whether PAK6 has a
potential role in regulating invasive potential in H358-S
cells and in a panel of NSCLC cell lines established
from smokers (H1299, H1650 and H1703). Endogenous
expression of PAK6 was knocked down using siRNA or
its activity was inhibited using PF-3758309 and invasion
assays were performed. Depletion of PAK6 using siRNA
resulted in a significant decrease in the invasive ability
of the H538-S cells and NSCLC cell lines (Figure 5A
and 5B). A similar decrease in the invasive property of
cells was observed when PAK6 was inhibited using
PF-3758309 in both H358-S and panel of NSCLC cells
(Figure 5C–5D). These results suggest that inhibition/
silencing of PAK6 can remarkably decrease the metastatic
potential of NSCLC.

Inhibition of PAK6 decreases cellular
proliferation in NSCLC cells exposed to cigarette
smoke
Having observed that PAK6 is activated in H358-S
cells and that its signaling is modulated by AKT, we next
studied the functional significance of PAK6 in lung cancer.
To determine whether PAK6 activity had any effect on
cell proliferation, we knocked down the expression of
PAK6 in H358-S cells using specific siRNA. Western blot
analysis post-transfection with PAK6 siRNA revealed a
successful knockdown of PAK6 in H358-S and NSCLC
cell lines used in our study (Supplementary Figure S2A).
We observed that silencing of PAK6 significantly reduced
the colony forming ability of H358-S cells (Figure 4A).
In addition, we used an alternative strategy to suppress
PAK6 activity using PAK inhibitor (PF-3758309) and
examined its effect on proliferation of H358-S and H1299
cells (Supplementary Figure S2B and S2C). Our data
clearly shows that proliferation of H358-S and H1299
cells were significantly reduced in the presence of PF3758309. In agreement with our siRNA data, inhibition
of PAK6 using PF-3758309, led to decrease in the colony
forming ability of H358-S cells (Figure 4B). Western blot
analysis revealed a decrease in p-PAK6 levels in NSCLC
cell lines treated with PAK inhibitor (PF-3758309)
(Supplementary Figure S2D).

Inhibition of PAK6 suppresses tumor growth
in vivo
To further corroborate our studies which demonstrate
the role of PAK6 in regulating cellular proliferation and
invasive potential in vitro, we next studied the effect of
PAK6 inhibition in vivo. H358-S and H1299 (2 × 106)
cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flanks
of NOD-SCID mice. At day 7 and 21, when the tumors
reached the size of approximately 50 mm3 for H358-S
and H1299 respectively, mice were randomized into two
groups of five animals each and treated with either vehicle

alone (DMSO) or PF-3758309 (20 mg/kg/injection, every
3 days for 3 weeks) intraperitoneally (i.p.). Tumor size
was measured every 3 days and the mean tumor volume
was calculated. A significant difference (p < 0.05) in tumor
growth was observed between control and treated group

over a 42-day experimental period (Figure 6A and 6C).
The mice were sacrificed at the end of 42 days and tumors
extracted from PF-3758309 treated group had significant
lower tumor mass compared to the vehicle control
(Figure 6B and 6D).

A Chi-square test confirmed that the overexpression of
PAK6 in lung tumor tissues was statistically significant
(p-value = 7.666E-11). Representative staining patterns
for PAK6 in NSCLC and normal lung tissue are provided
in Figure 6E. The results of the immunohistochemical
validation are provided in Table 2.

Our results indicate that PAK6 is activated in lung
cancer cells in response to cigarette smoke and targeting
PAK6 leads to a decrease in oncogenic potential of
NSCLC cells. With this we propose that PAK6 can act
as a therapeutic target for NSCLC especially in smokers.
PAK6 is known to be upregulated in hepatocellular
carcinoma and prostate cancer [20, 21]. However, there
is no report on the expression of PAK6 in lung cancer. We
next studied the expression of PAK6 in primary lung tissue
(adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) using
immunohistochemical staining. Tissue microarray-based
immunohistochemical validation was carried out using
78 cases of NSCLC. Staining intensity was scored as
negative (0), moderate (1+) or strong (2+). About 66.6 % of
the NSCLC showed moderate to strong staining and 94%

Discussion
Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause
for lung cancer and recent studies have shown distinct
molecular signatures in lung tumors based on smoking
habits, suggesting the existence of divergent mechanisms
of tumorigenesis in smokers and non-smokers [33–35] 
However, molecular signaling induced in response to
cigarette smoke remains incompletely characterized. Here,

using a cell line model we have attempted to delineate the
altered signaling in response to chronic cigarette smoke
exposure. Studies which have investigated the effect of
CSC have reported epithelial to mesenchymal transition,
increased cell migration and decreased apoptosis in
lung cell lines treated with CSC [36, 37]. Consistent
with previously published studies, H358-S cells showed
increased migration, invasion and proliferative capacities
when compared to the parental cells. Some of the signaling
pathways reported to be induced in response to cigarette
smoke include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT,
Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and
NF-κΒ [38, 39]. It has been shown that activation of NF-κΒ

in response to cigarette smoke upregulates BCL-XL
leading to survival in human bronchial epithelial cells
[39]. In concordance with these studies, we observed an
increased expression of NF-κΒ and BCL-XL in H358 cells
chronically treated with cigarette smoke.
There are limited reports on proteomic alterations in
lung cancer upon acute exposure to CSC. Such studies have
identified increased expression of receptor for advanced
glycation endpoints (RAGE), thioredoxin (Trx) and
upregulation of kinases like ERK1/2, MEK6 and RSK1
[40–43]. However, there are no phosphoproteomic studies
investigating the global alteration in signaling pathways
upon chronic smoke exposure. Our data demonstrates

widespread alterations in signaling mechanism(s) in
H358-S cells. We observed hyperphosphorylation of the
activation sites of several kinases and their downstream
effectors in cigarette smoke exposed cells. We have
identified significant phosphorylation of STAT3 (S726)
(4.6 - fold) in response to cigarette smoke in our cell line
model. The findings are concordant with recent report
which has shown that cigarette smoke induces MMP2 and
MMP9 expressions through activation of JAK2/STAT3
pathway [44]. It is established that overexpression of AKT
plays a key role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression
[45]. Aberrant activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) signaling pathway has been identified in a wide
range of cancers [46, 47]. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is
under investigation as it is activated by multiple signaling
nodes such as EGFR, IGF-1R, c-MET. Currently, number
of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors such as RAD001, BEZ235 and
XL765 are under investigation either in combination or
with other EGFR TKIs [48–50]. However, their efficacy
still needs to be tested in a large cohort of NSCLC patients.
We report an enrichment of consensus AKT motif and
activation of AKT (increased phosphorylation at S473)
among the hyperphosphorylated phosphopeptides in the
smoke treated cells, which is suggestive of active PI3K/
AKT signaling in these cells. The other kinases identified
in our study included TAOK3 (S324), MAPK14 (Y182)
and PAK6 (S560) amongst others. TAOKs are Ste20prelated MAP kinases (MAP3Ks) that activate p38 MAPK
in response to genotoxic insults [29]. Chronic exposure
to cigarette smoke is known to be genotoxic and induces
genomic alterations [51, 52]. TAOKs are reported to
mediate ATM/ATR induced activation of p38 upon DNA
damage. p38 MAPK is known to be a stress sensor which
regulates cell cycle check points and activates PAK6 [28].
PAK isoforms are known to influence multiple cellular
processes including cell proliferation, invasion and
migration [27, 53].
PAK6 belongs to group II PAKs family, contains
a kinase domain and N-terminal CRIB domain but lacks
N-terminal auto inhibitory domain. Genomic amplification
of PAK4 is reported in ovarian and pancreatic cancers
[54, 55]. PAK4 overexpression is reported in various cancers
including ovarian, colon and gastric cancers [56–58].

PAK5 is reported to be overexpressed in colorectal and
gastric cancer [59, 60]. Liu et al have recently reported
overexpression of group I PAK in NSCLC tissues [61].
Another study independently have shown overexpression
of PAK4 and increased expression correlated with poor
outcome in NSCLC [26]. In our study, we have identified
PAK6 to be significantly phosphorylated at S560. S560
is located in the activation loop of PAK6 and is the
autophosphorylation site of PAK6, and its mutation leads to
blockade of PAK6 activation by MKK6 [28]. Unlike other
members of PAK family; limited information is available
on role of PAK6 in tumorigenesis. PAK6 is known to be
overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate
cancers [20, 21]. PAK6 is also known to bind ER-alpha
and this binding is known to increase upon administration
of tamoxifen [62]. In prostate cancer, chemo-sensitivity
to docetaxel was enhanced when used in combination
with PAK6 siRNA [63]. PAK6 has also been linked to
radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells. PAK6 inhibition, in
combination with irradiation results in significant decrease
in prostate cancer cell survival [64].
Our findings indicate that PAK6 plays a crucial
role in both proliferation and metastatic potential of
lung cancer cells in response to cigarette smoke. We
demonstrate here that chronic exposure to cigarette smoke
leads to activation of AKT and in turn PAK6. Consistent
with our in vitro assays, inhibition of PAK6 in vivo also
showed a reduction in lung tumor growth. In this study,
tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining
revealed overexpression of PAK6 in more than 66.6%
of the NSCLC cases, which again corroborates with
our in vitro findings. These results indicate PAK6 as a
novel potential target for NSCLC, especially in smokers.
Our findings further highlight the need for systematic
investigation of PAK6 as a potential therapeutic target for
lung cancer in a larger cohort of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and SILAC labeling
Human lung cancer cell line H358, H1650, H1299
and H1703 were obtained from American Type Culture

Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). H358 were grown in
DMEM and H1650, H1299 and H1703 were maintained
in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
mixture at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. To
study the effect of the cigarette smoke condensate (CSC,

Murty Pharmaceuticals, Inc., KY), H358 cells were
grown in the smoking dedicated incubator [22]. H358
cells were subjected to chronic treatment with 0.1% CSC
for 12 months [65]. Cells that were grown in a normal
incubator that did not have any cell lines treated with CSC
are labeled as control or parental (H358-P). The H358-P

C6-lysine and 13C6-arginine and H358-S cells were
maintained in regular media [66].

Magic C18 AQ 5 µm, 120 Å) by a linear gradient from
5 to 60% ACN in 90 minutes. MS and MS/MS scans
were acquired at resolving power of 60,000 and 15.000
at 400 m/z, respectively. HCD fragmentation of the 10
most abundant ions was carried out in a data dependent
manner (isolation width: 1.90 m/z; normalized collision
energy: 35%). The tandem mass spectrometry data were
searched using MASCOT (v 2.2) and SEQUEST search
algorithms against a Human RefSeq database (RefSeq 59)
supplemented with frequently observed contaminants
through the Proteome Discoverer platform (v1.3, Thermo
Scientific, Bremen, Germany). For both algorithms, the
search parameters included a maximum of 2 missed
cleavage; carbamidomethylation at cysteine as a fixed
modification, oxidation at methionine, phosphorylation
at serine, threonine and tyrosine and SILAC labels 13C6Lysine; 13C6-Arginine as variable modifications. The
MS error tolerance was set at 20 ppm and MS/MS error
tolerance to 0.1 Da. The data were searched against a decoy
database and the results from both searches were used to
estimate q values using the Percolator algorithm within
the Proteome Discoverer suite. Peptides were considered
identified at a q value of <0.01 [68]. The probability of
phosphorylation for each S/T/Y site on each peptide
was calculated by the PhosphoRS node (Version 3.0)
in the Proteome Discoverer [69]. Peptides with ≥ 75%
phosphosites probability were considered for further
analysis. Identification of enriched motifs was carried out
using motif-X algorithm [30]. Phosphowindow of 15 aa
long was used for extracting consensus motif.

Trypsin digestion and basic pH reverse phase
liquid chromatography
Post twelve hours of serum starvation, cells were
harvested and lysed in urea lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES
pH 8.0, 9 M urea, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mM
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM phosphoglycerophosphate).
Protein concentration was determined using BCA assays.
Five mg of lysate from treated and untreated conditions
were mixed. The mixture was reduced with dithiothreitol
at 60°C and alkylated using iodoacetamide at room
temperature. Concentration of urea was brought to 2 M
using HEPES buffer and digested overnight at 37°C
using modified trypsin (Promega). The protein digests
were loaded onto Sep-Pak C18 column which was washed
with TFA and eluted using 40% ACN with 0.1% TFA.
The peptide samples were lyophilized and subjected to
basic pH reverse phase chromatography (bRPLC). The
lyophilized samples were reconstituted in bRPLC solvent
A (7 mM TAEBC, pH 9) and were separated on XBridge
BEH C18 Column (Waters, UK) with a linear increase
in gradient from 5 to 100% of 7 mM TEABC with
90% acetonitrile (pH 9) over 30 min. and persisting for
10 minutes. For each condition, 24 fractions were
collected and dried before LC-MS/MS analysis.

Titanium dioxide-based phosphopeptide
enrichment

LC-MS/MS data availability
The raw data has been submitted to ProteomeXchange
Consortium (http://www.proteomecentral.proteomexchange.
org) via the PRIDE public data repository [70] and can be
accessed using the data identifier – PXD003108.

The peptides from each fraction were further
enriched for phosphopeptides using TiO2-based enrichment
method [67]. Briefly, the TiO2 beads were washed in 5%
2, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) for 2 hours on the
rotator at room temperature. The bRPLC peptide fractions
were dissolved in 5% DHB and incubated with TiO2 beads
for 30 minutes on a rotator at room temperature. The
phosphopeptide-TiO2 beads were washed several times and
eluted thrice with 2% ammonia. The enriched peptides were
concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and desalted using
C18 StageTips. The enriched and desalted peptide samples
were further subjected to mass spectrometry analysis.

Western blotting
Whole cell extracts of H358-P and H358-S cells
were prepared using modified RIPA lysis buffer (Merck
Millipore, Billerica, MA,) containing protease inhibitors
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN,) and phosphatase inhibitors
(Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Western blot
analysis was performed as previously described using 30 µg
protein lysates [65, 71]. Nitrocellulose membranes were
hybridized with primary antibodies and developed using
Luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,)
as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Anti-PAK6
antibody was obtained from Novus (Novus Biologicals,
Littleton CO), Phospho-PAK6 (Ser 560), Anti-AKT and
phospho-AKT (Ser 473) antibodies were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA). Beta-actin antibody was obtained from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

LC-MS/MS and data analysis
LC-MS/MS analysis of enriched phosphopeptides
was carried out using Eksigent nanoflow liquid
chromatography interfaced with a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos
mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA).
The peptides were loaded onto a 2 cm × 75 µm, Magic C18
AQ 5 µm, 120 Å trap column at a flow rate of 3 µl/min
using 0.1% formic acid for enrichment. The peptides
were separated on an analytical column (10 cm × 75 µm,

Cell proliferation assays

complete growth media and the plates were incubated at
37°C for 48 hours. Post incubation time, the upper surface
of the membrane was wiped with a cotton-tip applicator to
remove non-migratory cells. Cells that migrated to the lower
surface of membrane were fixed and stained by methylene
blue. Each measurement was performed in duplicate and the
experiments were repeated three times.

Cell proliferation assays were carried out as
described previously [72]. H358-P and H358-S cells were
seeded at a density of 12,000 cells/well into 6-well plate
and cells were counted subsequently after every 48 hours.
Cell proliferation was determined over a period of 10 days
and growth kinetics was plotted [73]. All experiments
were carried out in triplicates.

In vivo studies
Xenografts were generated in 6-week-old NODSCID male mice with H358-S and H1299 (2 × 106)
cells. Ten mice with successfully engrafted H358-S and
H1299 xenografts were randomized into two cohorts
of five animals per group and were treated with either
DMSO or PF-3758309 (20 mg/kg/injection, every 3 days)
intraperitoneally (i.p.). Tumor size was measured after
every 3 days using digital calipers (Fisher Scientific) upto
three weeks and the mean tumor volume was calculated
using the formula (π/6(d1xd2)3/2) [76]. Mice were housed
in pathogen free conditions at the experimental animal
facility of Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore, India
and the experiments described here were conducted
according to the institutional ethical guidelines.

siRNA transfection
ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool control siRNA and
PAK6 siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette,
CO). The H358-smoke, H1299, H1650 and H1703 cells
were transfected with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Transfection was carried out as previously described
[65,  71] . Cells were subjected to invasion assays and
colony formation assays 48 hours post-transfection, unless
otherwise stated.

Colony formation assays
H358-S cells were treated with either PAK6
inhibitor PF-3758309 or transfected with PAK6 siRNA or
scramble siRNA. 48 h post transfection, 3 × 103 cells were
seeded in 6-well plates with complete media. The resulting
colonies were fixed with methanol, and stained with
Giemsa (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The number of colonies
per dish was counted. All experiments were performed in
triplicate and standard deviation was calculated.

Immunohistochemistry
A semi-quantitative assessment was performed to
evaluate the immunoreactivity as described previously
[77]. Briefly, the formalin fixed paraffin embedded
tissue sections were deparaffinised and antigen retrieval
was carried out using heat-induced epitope retrieval by
incubating them for 20 minutes in antigen retrieval buffer
(0.01 M Trisodium citrate buffer, pH 6). The quenching
of endogenous peroxidases was done by using a blocking
solution followed by washes with wash buffer (PBS
with 0.05% Tween-20). The sections were incubated
with primary antibody overnight at 4oC in a humidified
chamber. Anti-PAK6 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton CO)
was used at 1:1500 dilution. After incubation with the
primary antibody, the sections were washed thrice with
wash buffer. The slides were incubated with appropriate
horseradish peroxidase conjugated rabbit secondary
antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature. Excess
secondary antibody was removed using wash buffer
followed by addition of DAB substrate. The signal was
developed using DAB chromogen (DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark). Tissue sections were then observed under
the microscope. The immunohistochemical labeling was
assessed by an experienced pathologist. The intensity of
staining was scored on a grading scale ranging from 0 to
2+, where 0 represented negative staining, 1+ represented
moderate staining, and 2+ represented strong staining.
To determine statistical significance of difference of
expression chi-square test was carried out.

Wound migration assays
The wound migration assays were performed as
described previously [74]. Briefly, the cells were seeded
and uniform size wound was introduced in each condition.
H358- S and H1299 were treated with PAK6 inhibitor PF3758309 or vehicle control. The cells were allowed to
grow for 20 hours. The wound photomicrographs at 0 and
20 hours were taken under microscope. All experiments
were performed in triplicate unless otherwise indicated.

Invasion assays
Invasion assays were performed in a transwell
system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with Matrigelcoated filters, and cellular invasion was evaluated after
48 hours as described [71, 75]. Briefly, invasive property
of the cells was assayed in the membrane invasion culture
system using PET membrane (8-μm pore size). The cells
were seeded at density of 2.0 x 104 cells in 500 μl of serum
free media on the Matrigel-coated PET membrane in the
upper compartment. The lower compartment was filled with
