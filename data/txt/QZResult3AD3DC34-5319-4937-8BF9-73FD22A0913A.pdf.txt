Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is often treated with the cytotoxic drug
temozolomide, but the disease inevitably recurs in a drug-resistant form after initial treatment. Here, we report that in GBM
cells, even a modest decrease in the mismatch repair (MMR)
components MSH2 and MSH6 have profound effects on temozolomide sensitivity. RNAi-mediated attenuation of MSH2 and
MSH6 showed that such modest decreases provided an unexpectedly strong mechanism of temozolomide resistance. In a mouse
xenograft model of human GBM, small changes in MSH2 were
sufﬁcient to suppress temozolomide-induced tumor regression.
Using The Cancer Genome Atlas to analyze mRNA expression
patterns in tumors from temozolomide-treated GBM patients, we
found that MSH2 transcripts in primary GBM could predict

patient responses to initial temozolomide therapy. In recurrent
disease, the absence of microsatellite instability (the standard
marker for MMR deﬁciency) suggests a lack of involvement of
MMR in the resistant phenotype of recurrent disease. However,
more recent studies reveal that decreased MMR protein levels
occur often in recurrent GBM. In accordance with our ﬁndings,
these reported decreases may constitute a mechanism by which
GBM evades temozolomide sensitivity while maintaining microsatellite stability. Overall, our results highlight the powerful
effects of MSH2 attenuation as a potent mediator of temozolomide resistance and argue that MMR activity offers a predictive
marker for initial therapeutic response to temozolomide treatment. Cancer Res; 75(15); 3127–38. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

survival by only 1 to 2 months, with recurrent GBM showing a
strong chemoresistant phenotype.
Although temozolomide induces a variety of DNA base lesions,
toxicity is mediated primarily by DNA mismatch repair (MMR)dependent processing at O6-methylguanine (O6-meG) base
lesions produced by temozolomide (3); such processing can be
prevented by O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT)mediated removal of the methyl group from the O6 position of
guanine (4). In approximately half of all GBM, MGMT is epigenetically silenced by promoter methylation at the MGMT locus,
and MGMT levels are inversely correlated to the response of GBM
patients to temozolomide (5, 6). In the absence of MGMTmediated O6-meG repair, the MMR machinery potentiates the
toxicity of O6-meG lesions. During replication, DNA polymerase
inserts thymine opposite O6-meG and the MutSa recognition
complex, composed of an MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer, binds the
O6-meG:T mismatch recruiting MutLa (composed of an MLH1
and PMS2 heterodimer) and Exo1. These proteins excise a stretch
of single-stranded DNA containing the thymine opposite O6-meG
creating a gap in the DNA. To complete mismatch repair, DNA
polymerase ﬁlls the gap before DNA ligation, only to once again
insert thymine opposite O6-meG, stimulating another round of
MMR. This futile MMR cycling and accumulation of ssDNA gaps
generate double-strand breaks upon subsequent rounds of replication, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and/or cell death (3, 7, 8).
Temozolomide resistance can be achieved either by increased
MGMT levels or by mutations in the MMR machinery that prevent
futile MMR cycling at unrepaired O6-meG lesions. Recurrent GBM

Glioblastoma (GBM), or WHO grade IV glioma, is the most
common and aggressive type of brain cancer with a median
survival of 9.7 months after patient diagnosis (1). GBM treatment
consists of surgical resection of the main tumor mass followed by
radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy. Frontline chemotherapy in the treatment of GBM consists of temozolomide
(TMZ), an oral SN1 mono-alkylating agent shown to increase
overall survival when administered with radiotherapy (2).
Although considered a success, on average temozolomide extends

tumors only occasionally harbor mutations in MMR genes accompanied by microsatellite instability (MSI; refs. 9–12); this has been
taken to mean that MMR infrequently plays a role in the resistant
phenotype of recurrent disease. However, a recent study by the
German Glioma network found frequent decreases in MMR
protein levels in recurrent GBM relative to their initial tumors,
suggesting that MMR deﬁciencies are more common than currently appreciated (13). Additional studies have also identiﬁed
subsets of GBM patients that present with decreased MMR protein
levels at recurrence (14).
Here, we used an in vitro model of acquired temozolomide
resistance to identify changes associated with decreased temozolomide sensitivity. As in human tumors, we observed that
decreases in certain MMR machinery proteins correlate with
temozolomide resistance. Strikingly, we show that remarkably
small decreases in some MMR components, primarily MSH2, lead
to unexpected temozolomide resistance in vitro. We demonstrate
that such modest decreases in MSH2 lead to a signiﬁcant growth
advantage for GBM tumor cells in an in vivo mouse model of GBM
temozolomide chemotherapy. Finally, we show that low MSH2
and MSH6 transcript levels in GBM tumors are prognostic for
patient survival after temozolomide treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
U87MG, LN229, and A172 GBM cells were purchased from
ATCC, expanded and used within 10 passages. Mouse GL261
GBM cells lines, previously described (15), were a gift from
Dr. David Zagzag (New York University, New York, NY). Cell
lines were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen-strep) under standard
incubation conditions.
Generation of p53, MSH2, and MSH6 knockdown cells
Lentiviral shRNA constructs and packaging plasmids (psPAX2
and pMD2.G) were transfected into 293T cells to produce lentiviral particles. U87MG cells were infected with lentivirus and
shRNA-expressing cells selected in puromycin.
Drug treatments and cell survival measurements
For the generation of temozolomide-resistant GBM cell lines,
U87MG, LN229, and A172 cells were treated with temozolomide at the speciﬁed concentrations (Fig. 1A) for 3 hours in
serum-free media. More details about this protocol can be
found in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. For acute
temozolomide and BCNU treatments, GBM cells were treated
for 1 hour in serum-free media at the speciﬁed concentrations;
drug-containing media were then replaced with complete
media. For ionizing radiation treatment, cells were irradiated
in complete media using a gamma cell irradiator for the time
period necessary to achieve the speciﬁed exposure. For MNNG
treatment, cells were treated in complete media and exposure
time determined by its rapid decay. Sensitivity to treatment was
measured using a ﬂow cytometry-based proliferation assay as
described in ref. 16.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle proﬁles of GBM cells were obtained by ethanol
ﬁxation followed by staining with propidium iodide as described
in ref. 17.

3128 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

Immunoblotting
Cells were harvested at the appropriate conditions by scraping
into ice cold PBS, centrifuged, washed, lysed and protein was
quantiﬁed. Gel electrophoresis, membrane transfer, and blotting
for p53, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2, phosphoserine H2AX, and
total H2AX levels were performed as described in ref. 17 and
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Host cell reactivation
GG mismatch and O6-meG:C containing ﬂuorescent plasmids
were transfected into parental and TMZR3 GBM cells by electroporation. Fluorescent protein expression was assessed by ﬂow
cytometry and compared with the expression levels of a transfection using plasmids containing no lesion. Each transfection also
contained a transfection control to calculate DNA mismatch and
MGMT repair capacities of GBM cells. More details about this
protocol can be found in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods section and in ref. 18.
GL261 in vitro and in vivo competition assay
The effects of decreased MSH2 levels on the sensitivity of
murine GL261 GBM cells were assessed when cultured in vitro as
well as when injected into mouse brains to recapitulate GBM
tumors in vivo, using a competition assay. For both competition
assays, GL261 cells were infected with shRNA vectors such that
20% to 40% of cells express the shRNA and are marked by GFP.
For the in vitro competition assay, 96 hours after exposure, single
cell suspensions were prepared and the percentage of GFP-positive cells quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry. For the in vivo competition
assay, mice were euthanized when appropriate criteria presented,
brains were removed, tumors localized, excised, and dissociated.
Suspensions of GL261 cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry to
assess the percentage of GFP-positive cells.
The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and clinical patient
data were downloaded from the Broad Firehose data portal and
the NCI TCGA data matrix, respectively. Data were z-scored and
patients treated with temozolomide were chosen for analysis on
the effects of MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS2, MLH1, and MGMT
expression levels on survival. More details can be found in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods section.

Results
Generation of temozolomide-resistant p53-proﬁcient and p53deﬁcient GBM cells by periodic exposure to escalating doses of
temozolomide
Results from TCGA Research Network identiﬁed mutations in
TP53, a major node in the cellular response to DNA damage, in
almost 40% of tumor samples obtained mostly from primary
GBM patients (10). To identify changes associated with acquired
temozolomide resistance in GBM, we generated resistant cell lines
by periodic exposure of U87MG GBM cells that were p53-proﬁcient (control) and p53-deﬁcient (p53kd; Supplementary Fig. S1A
and S1B) to increasing doses of temozolomide; the selection
process is shown in Fig. 1A. The periodic exposures to increasing

Minor Decreases in MSH2 Mediate Chemoresistance

Previous reports suggest that p53 loss may sensitize GBM cells
to temozolomide (23, 24). However, we ﬁnd that control and
p53kd cells achieved conﬂuence at similar times following the
various temozolomide treatment cycles (data not shown). A cell
survival assay (16) was used to measure the temozolomide
sensitivity of parental cells (control and p53kd) and of cells from
the third round of temozolomide selection (control-TMZR3 and
p53kd-TMZR3). Control and p53kd cells exhibited very similar
temozolomide sensitivity. In contrast, both control-TMZR3 and
p53kd-TMZR3 displayed a strong temozolomide-resistant phenotype (Fig. 1B) demonstrating that both p53-proﬁcient and p53deﬁcient cells are capable of acquiring temozolomide resistance.
Consistent with the role of p53 in the tetraploid checkpoint
(25), p53kd cells rapidly became polyploid in response to
temozolomide exposure and maintained polyploidy throughout subsequent rounds of temozolomide selection (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Metaphase chromosome analysis conﬁrmed the polyploid phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S2B and
S2C). Control and p53kd GBM cells underwent a robust cellcycle arrest at the late S/G2–M boundary two cell-cycle times
after a single temozolomide treatment (Fig. 1C and D). This
timing corresponds to the time at which MMR-induced processing at O6-meG leads to double-strand break formation at
collapsed replication forks (3). In contrast, TMZR3 GBM cells
did not activate a cell-cycle checkpoint two cell-cycle times
after drug exposure. Immunoblot analysis of H2AX phosphorylation after temozolomide treatment revealed that TMZR3
cells exhibit decreased H2AX phosphorylation compared with
parental lines (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S3).
As the toxicity of temozolomide is attributed primarily to
the formation of O6-meG lesions in the DNA, we investigated
temozolomide-induced levels of O6-meG in parental and TMZR3
cells by isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. This analysis
revealed that parental and TMZR3 cells acquire very similar levels
of O6-meG upon temozolomide exposure, eliminating the possibility that cells become resistant by somehow preventing temozolomide from reacting with genomic DNA (Supplementary
Table S1).
The temozolomide-resistant phenotype is speciﬁc for O6-meG
formation, does not confer resistance to ionizing radiation or
1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitroso-urea (BCNU), and is
independent of MGMT
To assess whether temozolomide resistance was accompanied
by resistance to other types of DNA-damaging agents relevant to
GBM therapy, cells were exposed to MNNG (an SN1 alkylating
agent), BCNU (a DNA cross-linking bifunctional alkylating
agent), and ionizing radiation (an agent that induces DSB's and
various oxidized DNA bases). TMZR3 cells displayed strong resistance to MNNG, demonstrating that resistance extends to SN1
alkylating agents that induce O6-meG and is not speciﬁc to
the structure of temozolomide (Fig. 1F). Parental and TMZR3
cells did not display signiﬁcant differences in their sensitivity to
ionizing radiation, suggesting that temozolomide resistance was
not due to increased double-strand break repair (Fig. 1G). Before

the adoption of temozolomide as the frontline chemotherapeutic
agent for GBM patients, BCNU was the major chemotherapeutic
agent used to treat GBM. It is well documented that MGMT
expression greatly reduces the sensitivity of cells to BCNU, a DNA
cross-linking agent whose mechanism of action initially involves
formation of O6-chloroethyl lesions that are efﬁciently removed
by MGMT (26, 27). The U87MG cell line, from which control and
p53kd cells are derived, does not express MGMT, due to epigenetic
silencing of the MGMT locus by promoter methylation (28),
making it feasible that resistance could be achieved by MGMT
derepression. Parental and TMZR3 cells were equally sensitive to
BCNU treatment (Fig. 1H), suggesting that TMZR3 cells are
unlikely to have reactivated MGMT expression. The temozolomide-resistant phenotype of GBM cells obtained after selection
appears to be speciﬁc for monofunctional SN1 alkylating agents
and likely independent of MGMT-mediated enhanced O6-meG
repair. Immunoblot analysis of parental and TMZR3 cells conﬁrmed that MGMT was not expressed in any of the TMZR3 cells
obtained after selection (Fig. 2A). To rule out the possibility
that MGMT protein levels fell below the limit of detection, or
that cells repaired O6-meG in an MGMT-independent manner,
we used an in-cell host cell reactivation (HCR) assay for O6meG repair (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Parental and TMZR3 cells
displayed equally low O6-meG repair activity conﬁrming that
increased MGMT activity is not responsible for the temozolomide-resistant phenotype of TMZR3 cells. T98G cells, a GBM
cell line known to expresses MGMT (29), serves as a positive
control for MGMT activity (Fig. 2B). These data show that
MGMT does not play a role in our system of acquired temozolomide resistance.
MMR protein levels and activity are deregulated in
TMZR3 cells
MMR is known to mediate toxic processing of O6-meG (30).
Immunoblot analysis of parental and TMZR3 cells revealed
decreases in the MutSa MMR recognition complex components,
MSH6 and MSH2 (Fig. 2C) with virtually no change in the MutLa
components, MLH1 and PMS2 (data not shown). However, these
decreases were modest with 50% MSH6 and 70% MSH2 protein
remaining (Fig. 2D and E). An in-cell HCR assay was used to
determine whether these modest decreases in MSH2 and MSH6
correlated with diminished MMR capacity in TMZR3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). TMZR3 cells displayed roughly 50%
decreased MMR capacity compared with their respective parental
cells (Fig. 2F). We infer that diminished MMR capacity likely
contributes to temozolomide resistance in TMZR3 cells, and
sought to confer whether modest MMR decreases could account
for the resistance of TMZR3 cells.
Very limited knockdown of MSH2 protein levels leads to
extensive temozolomide chemoresistance in GBM cells in vitro
Using a panel of lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting
MSH2 or MSH6 transcripts, we created a library of U87MG GBM
cells with varying degrees of MSH2 or MSH6 knockdown (Fig. 3A

Minor Decreases in MSH2 Mediate Chemoresistance

temozolomide sensitivity was observed as a function of MSH6
knockdown with a transition to temozolomide resistance in cells
with 32% or less residual MSH6 protein (Figs. 3A and C and 4C).
Temozolomide resistance correlated with decreased late-S/G2–M
accumulation after temozolomide treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S6A and S6B). Strikingly, the temozolomide sensitivity of MSH2
knockdown cells revealed that a modest 15% decrease in MSH2
protein levels was sufﬁcient to yield robust temozolomide resistance compared with cells expressing a nonsilencing hairpin
control (Figs. 3B and D and 4D). Again, the temozolomideresistant phenotype correlated with decreased late-S/G2–M accumulation after temozolomide treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7A
and S7B). It is important to note that, like TMZR3 cells, none of the
MSH2 and MSH6 knockdown cells showed any resistance to
BCNU compared with control (Fig. 3E and F). Therefore BCNU
treatment could be an effective alternative for GBM patients with
recurrent disease.
As MSH2 appears to be such a potent mediator of temozolomide resistance, we investigated whether decreased MSH2
levels are selected for in other GBM backgrounds. Selecting for
temozolomide-resistant cells in A172 and LN229 GBM cells
using our previously described protocol (Fig. 1A) resulted in
the generation of cells with a signiﬁcant decrease in sensitivity
to temozolomide and decreased MMR activity compared with
parental cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A, S8B, S8E, and S8F).
Analysis of MSH2 protein levels revealed that minor decreases
in MSH2 levels are selected for in both GBM backgrounds
(Supplementary Fig. S8C, S8D, S8G, and S8H). It should be
noted, however, that in a separate experiment we obtained
temozolomide-resistant LN229 cells that did not display
decreased MSH2 protein levels despite decreased sensitivity
to temozolomide and decreased MMR activity (data not
shown).
To investigate how temozolomide resistance correlated to
MMR activity in MSH knockdown cells, MMR-HCR was used to
measure MMR activity in MSH knockdown cell lines that displayed sensitivity to temozolomide (MSH6 kd #2 with 51%
residual MSH6 protein) and resistance to temozolomide (MSH6
kd #5 with 10% residual MSH6 protein; MSH2 kd #2 with 63%
residual MSH2 protein and MSH2 kd #5 with 16% residual MSH2
protein). MMR activity in the temozolomide-sensitive MSH6 kd
#2 cell line was statistically indistinguishable from cells expressing
a nonsilencing hairpin control. In contrast, decreased MMR
activity was observed for the three MSH knockdowns that displayed temozolomide resistance (Fig. 4A). These observations are
consistent with MSH6 monomer levels found in excess compared
with free MSH2, making MSH2, the limiting factor in MutSa
formation (Fig. 4B).
It is well documented that MSH2 and MSH6 stability is inﬂuenced by their dimerization (31). MSH2 has two dimerization
partners, namely MSH6 and MSH3, generating the MutSa and
MutSb heterodimers, respectively. In contrast, MSH6 only
dimerizes with MSH2 (32), which recognizes and binds

O6-meG:T mismatches (3). Given that MSH2 has two binding
partners, we investigated MSH2 stability in the MSH6 knockdown
GBM cells; resistance to temozolomide was only seen when
MSH6 loss began to destabilize MSH2 as reﬂected by decreased
MSH2 protein levels (Fig. 4C and E and Supplementary Fig. S9A).
Analysis of MSH6 stability in the MSH2 knockdown cells
revealed that MSH6 protein levels decreased linearly with decreasing MSH2 protein levels (Fig. 4D and F and Supplementary
Fig. S9B). Therefore, it appears that resistance to temozolomide
was observed at MSH6 or MSH2 knockdown levels where destabilization of the binding partner becomes apparent, which presumably accompanies decreased MutSa dimer levels and
decreased binding to O6-meG-T mispairs.
Small reductions in Msh2 decrease the in vivo response of GBM
tumors to temozolomide therapy
To determine whether the effect of minor decreases in MSH2
protein levels on the response of cultured GBM cells to temozolomide are relevant when treating brain tumors, we used the
GL261 syngeneic mouse model of GBM. GL261 glioma cells form
robust tumors that have characteristics consistent with human
GBM when injected into the brain of syngeneic C57B6/J mice
(15). GL261 GBM cells were infected with retroviral particles
containing vectors expressing either a vector control, Msh2 hairpin 1 or Msh2 hairpin 2, leading to 0%, 10%, or 40% Msh2 mRNA
knockdown, respectively, and 0%, 25%, or 50% Msh2 protein
knockdown, respectively (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S10).
The infection was carried out such that 20% to 40% of GL261 cells
expressed shRNA and a marker GFP. Assessment of the fraction of
GFP-positive cells after temozolomide treatment, establishes
whether the Msh2 hairpins confer a selective advantage (yielding
enrichment of GFP cells), a selective disadvantage (yielding
depletion) or have no effect on the GBM cells (Fig. 5B). These
competition experiments were conducted in both cell culture
(in vitro), or after transplant into the mouse brain (in vivo). As
expected, cells expressing the vector control were neither enriched
nor depleted in response to temozolomide treatment in vitro or in
vivo (Fig. 5C and D). In contrast, the Msh2 hairpin 2 expressing
cells conferred a large growth advantage upon temozolomide
treatment in vitro (Fig. 5C). Msh2 hairpin 1 expressing cells
displayed a trend toward a growth advantage but this was only
signiﬁcant for the 45 mmol/L dose (Fig. 5C). Similarly to MSH2
knockdown in U87MG cells, decreased Msh2 did not confer a
growth advantage to GL261 cells after BCNU exposure (Supplementary Fig. S11). More importantly, in vivo, signiﬁcant enrichment upon temozolomide treatment was observed for GFP cells
expressing either Msh2 hairpin, with hairpin 2 conferring a
stronger growth advantage than hairpin 1 consistent with the
higher degree of MSH2 knockdown (Fig. 5D and E). Thus, in two
distinct cell lines, and more importantly in the in vivo tumor
context, very modest decreases in MSH2 protein levels endow
GBM cells with a signiﬁcant growth advantage during temozolomide treatment.

Patients were stratiﬁed as high or low expressers by a z-score cutoff of 0.5. The log-rank test was used to assess signiﬁcance between the median survivals of both
populations.

MSH2 transcript levels are predictive for the overall survival of
temozolomide-treated primary GBM patients
Our results suggest that moderate decreases in MSH2 levels
alter the response of GBM tumors to temozolomide therapy.
This led us to hypothesize that if there were a range of MSH2
and MSH6 expression levels in primary GBM tumors, patients
with low expression would be less responsive to temozolomide
chemotherapy. To test our hypothesis, we ranked MSH2 and
MSH6 transcript levels of resected primary tumors among GBM
patients who had been treated with temozolomide. Transcript
levels were derived from TCGA data and ranked by a z-score of
0.5 as described in Materials and Methods (10). We observed
a trend for low MSH6 transcript levels being associated with
decreased survival in temozolomide-treated TCGA patients, but
the difference did not reach signiﬁcance for the overall survival
of temozolomide-treated GBM patients (Fig. 6A). However,
when we exclude patients whose survival falls on the tail end,
beyond the normal distribution for patient survival after temozolomide treatment (top 5th percentile), low MSH6 levels did
signiﬁcantly correlate with decreased GBM patient survival after
temozolomide treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 6D and Supplementary
Fig. S12A). Strikingly, low MSH2 transcript levels showed a
highly signiﬁcant correlation with decreased overall survival of
temozolomide-treated GBM patients (P < 0.05) and the corre-

lation was stronger (P < 0.001) for temozolomide-treated
patients minus the top 5th percentile for patient survival after
temozolomide treatment (Fig. 6B and E). Moreover, for this
subset there was a signiﬁcant correlation between MSH2 transcript levels and survival down to 0.25 z-score (Supplementary Fig. S12B). MGMT methylation status and transcript levels
are currently the most accepted molecular biomarkers for the
survival of GBM patients (5, 33). In this particular TCGA
dataset, low MGMT transcript levels were indeed signiﬁcantly
correlated with patient survival (P < 0.05), but only when we
exclude patients whose survival falls on the tail end of the
normal distribution (Fig. 6C and F). Taken together, it appears
that MSH2 levels are a strong predictor of GBM patient
response to initial temozolomide therapy.

Discussion
It has been assumed that the involvement of MMR in the
resistant phenotype of GBM is low due to studies investigating
markers of complete MMR deﬁciency, namely MSI and a mutator
phenotype (12). However, several studies have demonstrated
that, unlike complete loss of MSH2 or MLH1 function, even
severe decreases in MSH2 or MLH1 levels do not effectively induce
MSI (34–36). Our results suggest that the recently observed

Minor Decreases in MSH2 Mediate Chemoresistance

decreases in MMR protein levels in recurrent GBM (13) can be
responsible for the observed temozolomide resistance at recurrence. These decreases in isolation are unlikely to induce MSI
accounting for the underreporting of MMR alterations in recurrent
disease. Furthermore, our results suggest that the variation of
MMR protein levels in patients with newly diagnosed glioma, a
population essentially devoid of MMR mutations, may mediate
the innate resistance to temozolomide of numerous patients in
this population.
The study presented here indicates that MSH2 transcript and
protein levels strongly predict the response of GBM tumors to
temozolomide treatment, presumably reﬂecting decreased MutSa
activity. Characterization of MSH2 deﬁciency in whole animals
revealed that in terms of mutation spectrum and whole body
sensitivity to MNNG, a temozolomide analogue, MSH2 heterozygotes were analogous to MSH2 wild type mice. As expected,
MSH2 null mice were resistant to alkylation damage and had a
mutational spectrum consistent with MutSa loss (37, 38). These
results suggest that for a majority of tissues, loss of one copy of
MSH2 does not lead to haploinsufﬁciency or resistance to
O6-meG producing compounds. More recent work by Marra and
colleagues found that lymphoblastoid cells from HNPCC patients
that were carriers for an MSH2 mutation, and therefore heterozygous for wild-type MSH2, were resistant to temozolomideinduced damage (39). Therefore, it appears that for some cell
types, haploinsufﬁciency of MSH2 can result in resistance to
alkylation damage. It should be noted, however, that this haploinsufﬁciency resulted in an average of 40% of residual MSH2
protein, a much larger decrease than what is necessary to decrease
temozolomide sensitivity in GBM cells. This heterogeneous
response to moderate decreases in MSH2 levels and resistance to
SN1 alkylating agents may be a reﬂection of the total MutSa levels
or the ratio of total MSH2 to MSH6 in different cell types.
In conclusion, we identify minor MMR deﬁciencies as potent
mediators of temozolomide resistance in GBM. Furthermore, this
work identiﬁes MMR activity as a modulator of initial therapeutic
response to temozolomide. Future work identifying mechanisms

by which to increase MMR activity, possibly by increasing MSH2
levels, offers a point of intervention to potentiate temozolomide
efﬁcacy in GBM patients.
