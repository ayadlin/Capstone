BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is a debilitating symptom affecting psychosocial functioning and quality of
life in 70% to 100% of cancer patients during and after treatment. The authors examined the effect of 200 mg of
modafinil daily on the severity of cancer-related fatigue. METHODS: The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the effect of modafinil on patient-reported fatigue in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of 877 cancer patients beginning chemotherapy at 23
geographically separate University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program
(CCOP) affiliates were assessed for fatigue. Patients who reported fatigue (N ¼ 867) were randomly assigned to
receive either 200 mg of oral modafinil (Provigil) daily or a placebo. Treatment began on Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended
after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue and depression were assessed during Cycles 2 to 4 by using psychometrically valid
measures. Group differences (treatment vs control) in the worst level of fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4
were examined by using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline fatigue (Cycle 2). RESULTS:
There were 631 patients (315 modafinil, 316 placebo) who provided evaluable data. ANCOVA showed a significant
interaction between treatment condition and baseline fatigue (P ¼ .017), where patients with severe baseline fatigue
(n ¼ 458) benefited from modafinil, whereas patients with mild or moderate fatigue did not. Modafinil had no statistically significant effect on depression (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil may be useful in controlling cancer-related
fatigue in patients who present with severe fatigue but is not useful in patients with mild or moderate fatigue. Cancer

Most cancer patients experience cancer-related fatigue during the course of their disease and its treatment. For many
patients, the distressing effects of cancer-related fatigue persist long after treatment is completed.1,2 Cancer-related fatigue
is 1 of the most common and most frequently anticipated side effects of cancer treatment3; previous studies reported cancer-related fatigue incidence rates up to 100%.4,5 Of a large (n>1000) multisite sample from our University of Rochester
Cancer Center (URCC) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) affiliates, 95% expected fatigue as a side effect
of cancer treatment. These patients had a variety of cancer types, including hematologic, lung, breast, alimentary tract,
gynecologic, and genitourinary tract neoplasms.6

Original Article

Cancer-related fatigue can be a debilitating symptom that affects important areas of psychosocial functioning and quality of life.7,8 A key distinguishing feature
between cancer-related fatigue and the fatigue experienced
by healthy people is that cancer-related fatigue is not
relieved by rest or sleep.9-11
Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to control cancer-related fatigue have been studied. Minton and colleagues conducted a systematic and
meta-analytic review of pharmacological treatment for
cancer-related fatigue.12 These authors concluded that
methylphenidate and hematopoietic agents (for cancerrelated fatigue due to chemotherapy-induced anemia)
seemed effective. Nonetheless, future studies need to confirm these preliminary findings. A recent review of nonpharmacological therapies for cancer patients reported
that psychological interventions (eg, cognitive behavioral
therapy, supportive-expressive therapy, and psychosocial
interventions) and exercise (eg, multimodal exercise,
walking programs, and restorative approaches) had an
effect on cancer-related fatigue.13
Despite significant recent attention to the management of cancer-related symptoms, cancer-related fatigue
remains a persistent and distressing side effect of cancer
and its treatment. The prevalence, debilitating characteristics, and potential negative effects of cancer-related fatigue
on treatment adherence, psychosocial functioning, and
quality of life (QOL) underscore the necessity to identify
this symptom and develop effective interventions to control it. On the basis of clinical experience and positive
results from an open-label pilot study,14 the present study
examined the effect of a nonamphetamine-based stimulant, modafinil, on fatigue among cancer patients who
were undergoing chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, phase 3, clinical trial to examine the
effect of modafinil on patient-reported fatigue in cancer
patients who were undergoing chemotherapy. Eligibility
criteria included being at least 18 years of age, having a diagnosis of cancer with survival expectancy greater than 6
months, and being able to swallow medication. Patients
were required to be beginning a cancer-treatment course
of at least 4 planned cycles of chemotherapy with cycles at
least 2 weeks apart without concurrent radiation or interferon treatment. Patients were excluded from the study
when they had previously taken modafinil or any psychos-

3514

timulant, such as amphetamines, methylphenidate (Ritalin), pemoline (Cylert), or a monoamine oxidase
inhibitor, on a regular basis within the past 30 days. Other
exclusion criteria included being pregnant or nursing,
having uncontrolled anemia, any history of clinically significant cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, any
history of alcohol or drug abuse, severe headaches, glaucoma, seizure disorder, narcolepsy, Tourette syndrome, or
other psychiatric disorders. The institutional review
boards of the University of Rochester and the participating URCC CCOP affiliate sites approved the study protocol. All participants provided signed informed consent.
Intervention
Patients were contacted by telephone between the 5th and
10th day of their first chemotherapy cycle to assess their
levels of fatigue by using Question 3 of the Brief Fatigue
Inventory (BFI; ‘‘What is your worst level of fatigue during the past week?’’) Responses were reported on a scale
from 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (worst possible fatigue). We
choose worst level of fatigue because this state of cancerrelated fatigue could have a higher likelihood of affecting
psychosocial and activities of daily living and, perhaps,
treatment adherence and outcome for cancer patients.
Research also suggests that ratings of symptom at its worst
have the highest predictive value for patients’ ratings of
symptom interference.15,16 Those who reported a score of
at least 2 on the BFI Question 3 were invited to participate
in the study. This study is the first phase 3, randomized,
controlled trial to use modafinil on this population. We
selected a score of 2 on the BFI Question 3 to provide as
generous an entry as possible to facilitate greater likelihood of detection of improvement. Participants were
randomized with equal probability to either modafinil or
placebo by using a random number-generator program
from SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Baseline assessments
were taken after randomization and shortly after Cycle 2
of chemotherapy. Participants were instructed to start
with 100 mg of modafinil or placebo on Day 10 (before
January 2005) or Day 5 (after January 2005) of study
Cycle 2, then increase to the full dose of 200 mg of modafinil or placebo after 3 days, and continue on this regimen
until Day 7 of study Cycle 4, at which point all participants discontinued medication. The timing of the beginning dose was changed because accrual was inadequate.
The change resulted in a better match to clinical practice
in the private groups and tripled accrual with no change
in baseline values and no effect on outcome. Cephalon
(Frazer, Pa) supplied modafinil and placebo tablets for the

present study. Medication was discontinued in cases in
which chemotherapy was discontinued or delayed longer
than 3 weeks. Blinding was maintained throughout the
study.
Outcome Measures
Variables of interest were assessed by using psychometrically valid and reliable measures used in previous studies
of fatigue and found suitable for the present sample. Cancer-related fatigue was assessed by using Item 3 of the
BFI.17 We used BFI-3 because our pilot testing showed a
single question was more sensitive than the full BFI or
other multidimensional measures in detecting changes in
cancer-related fatigue. Excessive daytime sleepiness was
measured by using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)18
as a manipulation check that a clinically active dose of
modafinil was used, because we used a fixed dose, and
ESS values have been reliably shown to change with modafinil.19 Depression was assessed with the DepressionDejection subscale of the Profile of Mood States (POMSDD)20 and was included to further investigate the commonly reported high correlation between depression and
fatigue. Previous findings that paroxetine (Paxil), a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, significantly reduced depression in a study of 94 cancer patients
without affecting fatigue raised questions concerning any
causal link between depression and fatigue.21 If fatigue

Cancer

was found to be reduced with modafinil without any corresponding reduction in depression, then a causal link
between depression and fatigue would be challenged. Internal consistency of the above-mentioned measures, as
indicated by Cronbach alpha coefficients, ranged from an
alpha of 0.85 to 0.96. Participants completed self-report
measures of fatigue and psychological distress forms at
home for 1 week after each chemotherapy cycle. The primary outcome was the score on BFI-3 for study Cycle 4,
and the same score measured at baseline was used as a
covariate in the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis.
Although the data were screened for factors, such as outliers, compliance, and other anomalies, no subjects were
omitted from the analyses. Missing scores at Cycle 4 were
imputed with scores from Cycle 3 for patients who completed the study and provided evaluable data only through
study Cycle 3 (n ¼ 58 modafinil and n ¼ 29 placebo). To
confirm that this type of imputation did not introduce
biases, we repeated the primary analysis using multiple
imputation22 and found the analysis confirmed the results
reported here. The rate of missing value for the drug arm
was numerically larger than that of the placebo arm (Fig.
1). However, this difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .11). When excluding subjects that did not

complete the Cycle 4 questionnaire but remained on the
study, the difference was also not statistically significant
(P ¼ .80).
ANCOVA was used to address the primary objective. BFI-3 at Cycle 4 was the response variable. The factor was drug (modafinil or placebo). The covariate was
the baseline BFI-3 at Cycle 2 centered about the median.
The model allowed for an interaction between the treatment effect and baseline fatigue. ANCOVA was also conducted to assess the drug effect for the secondary
outcomes. Statistical significance was assessed with 2tailed P-values using an alpha level of 0.05.
The planned sample size was 837 patients with up to
30% (n ¼ 251) expected to be nonevaluable on the basis
of several previous symptom trials in cancer patients by
this same multicenter group. The remaining sample of
586 participants would provide 90% power to detect a
difference of 0.75 points between groups, based on an
alpha-level of 0.05, 2-tailed Student t test and standard

3516

deviation of 2.8.23 This power calculation is conservative
because the actual analysis included baseline fatigue as a
covariate in an ANCOVA that accounts for variability
from patient to patient. The assumptions underlying each
of the analyses were thoroughly checked with graphical
and regression diagnostics procedures. All statistical analyses were completed using SAS 9.1 and R 2.6.

RESULTS
Participants
A total of 877 cancer patients enrolled in the study. Of
this sample, 431 were randomly assigned modafinil and
436 were assigned a placebo. A total of 544 patients completed study Cycle 4. Missing Cycle-4 data for 87 patients
were imputed with Cycle 3 data as prestated in the protocol. Hence, data for 631 patients were available for analysis (Fig. 1). Sixty-seven percent of the participants were
females at baseline (Table 1). The majority of the sample

The treatment coefficient is the change in outcome level for modafinil relative to placebo at the median baseline. The interaction coefficient is the change in
outcome level (modafinil relative to placebo per unit change in the baseline). The interaction is important because it measures the size of the dependency of
the drug effect on baseline. The negative sign for BFI-3 means that the drug reduces cancer-related fatigue (CRF) more at higher baseline CRF. The P-values
are associated with 2-sided Student t tests for the coefficients (testing whether the coefficient is 0). When the interaction is significant, as with BFI-3, it must
be included (along with the treatment effect in the interpretation of the modafinil/placebo effect). See Table 4 for a practical interpretation.

patients with high baseline fatigue (Table 3). To further
interpret this interaction, we divided the patients into 3
categories on the basis of the severity of their baseline fatigue24,25 to mimic clinical impressions: ‘‘mild’’ (BFI-3

results showed a statistically significant group difference
(P ¼ .033) for those in the severe fatigue category.
Patients on modafinil had an average BFI-3 of 7.2,
whereas those on placebo had an average of 7.6. There
were no significant differences in BFI-3 in the mild or
moderate categories.
Daytime sleepiness, as measured by ESS as a check
that a clinically active dose of modafinil had been administered, showed a significant improvement in the modafinil group (P ¼ .002). The differences in depressionrelated outcomes were not statistically significant (all were
P > .05).
The proportion of patients who experienced any
adverse event was similar (P ¼ .46) for the modafinil and
placebo groups: 46 (11%) of 431 and 39 (9%) of 436,
respectively. The proportion of patients who experienced
a severe adverse event was also similar for the modafinil
and placebo groups: 37 (8.6%) and 34 (7.8%), respectively, for a total of 71 severe adverse events. A total of 16
adverse events were judged to be possibly due to the treatment: 10 occurred in patients taking modafinil (ie, 1 allergic reaction, 2 cardiac arrhythmia, 1 dyspnea, 2 headaches
and dizziness, 3 mood changes, and 1 myalgia), and 6
occurred in patients taking placebo (ie, 3 fever, 1 diarrhea,
1 dyspnea, 1 abdominal pain, and 1 cardiac arrhythmia).
Three of these adverse events were judged to be definitely
associated with the treatment (allergic reaction, dyspnea,
and headaches), and all 3 occurred in patients taking
modafinil. All 3 related adverse events judged to be related
to modafinil subsided when the drug was discontinued.

DISCUSSION
The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was
to examine the effect of the nonamphetamine-based stimulant modafinil on cancer-related fatigue among patients
undergoing chemotherapy. Previous open label studies

3518

reported that modafinil helped alleviate cancer-related fatigue after cancer treatment in 30 brain cancer patients26
and 51 breast cancer patients.17 The findings of the present study confirm these preliminary data and support the
use of 200 mg of modafinil as an effective treatment for
severe cancer-related fatigue in patients undergoing
chemotherapy.
Modafinil is a eugeroic agent that has been associated with minimal toxicities and a low susceptibility for
misuse. If tolerated by patients, modafinil could be used
effectively to alleviate cancer-related fatigue and consequently improve QOL for patients with severe cancerrelated fatigue. Modafinil has been shown to significantly
reduce excessive daytime sleepiness.19 In the present
study, the significant effect found on daytime sleepiness as
defined by the ESS demonstrated that the fixed 200 mg
dose given was biologically active and produced the same
significant clinical effects on sleepiness in cancer patients,
as shown in previous studies of various medical
populations.19
Despite increasing knowledge of the negative effect
of cancer-related fatigue on psychosocial functioning and
treatment outcome for cancer patients, few studies have
examined the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions
to control this side effect. The present study addresses this
paucity of relevant data. The findings show that modafinil
could be a useful agent to control cancer-related fatigue
and also characterize the severity level of cancer-related fatigue for which modafinil could be most useful. The heterogeneity and size of the present study sample indicate
the likelihood that these findings will be generalizable for
a wide variety of cancer patients who are undergoing
treatment.
Modafinil had an effect on cancer-related fatigue
but not on depression. Our previous research showed that
paroxetine hydrochloride (Paxil) alleviated depression but
had no significant effect on cancer-related fatigue.27,21

Cancer

Modafinil and Cancer-Related Fatigue/Jean-Pierre et al

This contrast could indicate that hypotheses of a common
underlying pathway for cancer-related fatigue and depression are debatable.14,17 The association between fatigue
and depression has always been correlational. Both the
previous randomized controlled trial and the present
study are randomized studies where one part of the associated pairing was changed with no effect on the other.
Although these findings do not suggest a disconnection
between cancer-related fatigue and depression, they do,
however, bring into question the association between
these 2 symptoms.
Our previous findings are that the more individual
questions added to a fatigue measurement scale, the more
it correlates with depression.28 This could be suggesting
that the consistently high correlations previously reported
between fatigue and depression may be measurement artifacts. This study and the previous paroxetine hydrochloride study support this view: fatigue and depression were
each effectively treated without affecting the other. When
measured properly by a single-item scale, fatigue is not
clinical depression by another name.
These findings have important clinical implications
for cancer-related symptom management. Questions
related to the etiology and assessment of cancer-related fatigue in divergent cancer types, stages, and clinical settings
remain open, and the mechanism of action of modafinil
remains unclear. Nevertheless, modafinil seems to be a
promising agent to diminish cancer-related fatigue for
patients with severe baseline cancer-related fatigue. Future
studies should focus on describing ways to maximize the
benefits of this agent and also on evaluating whether and
how modafinil could facilitate the effects of behavioral
interventions to alleviate cancer-related fatigue.
