Abstract

Author Manuscript

Targeted cancer therapies, while often effective, have limited utility due to preexisting primary or
acquired secondary resistance. Consequently, agents are sometimes used in combination to
simultaneously affect multiple targets. MicroRNA mimics are excellent therapeutic candidates
because of their ability to repress multiple oncogenic pathways at once. Here we treated the
aggressive Kras;p53 non-small cell lung cancer mouse model and demonstrated efficacy with a
combination of two tumor-suppressive microRNAs. Systemic nano-delivery of miR-34 and let-7
suppressed tumor growth leading to a survival advantage. This combinatorial microRNA
therapeutic approach engages numerous components of tumor-cell addictive pathways and
highlights the ability to deliver multiple microRNAs in a safe and effective manner to target lung
tissue.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essentially untreatable, likely due to accumulation
of mutations that affect the RAS and p53 pathways, and is the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide. Various strategies have been proposed to increase the survival of
NSCLC patients including prevention, early diagnosis, and more aggressive interventions
for late-stage cancers. Indeed, five-year survival rates can approach 70% with surgical

resection of stage IA disease (1). However, most individuals are diagnosed at late-stage (at
initial diagnosis, 55% of patients have distant metastatic disease), when their tumors and
metastatic lesions have become refractory to current treatment regiments. As such, better
treatments for late-stage, aggressive disease that do not solely depend on inhibiting a single
biological target are needed.

Author Manuscript

Superior, targeted treatment options depend on the individual cancer genotype and the
availability of tests to identify mutations susceptible to these therapies. NSCLC gene
signatures have uncovered typical protein-coding gene mutations as well as subsets of
microRNAs (miRNAs) that are aberrantly expressed (2,3). Remarkably, the levels of two
tumor-suppressive miRNAs, let-7 and miR-34, are often the most statistically altered
miRNAs in NSCLC tumor tissue (2,4–8). The reduction in let-7 and miR-34 expression is
particularly relevant to the NSCLC oncogenic phenotype, as these miRNAs target key
oncogenes involved in multiple stages of the tumorigenic process and in the maintenance of
oncogene addiction, such as RAS, BCL2, MET, and MYC (4,6,9–12). In addition, miR-34 is
a direct transcriptional target of and produces phenotypes akin to p53 (12–16).

Author Manuscript

The recent discovery that miRNAs are modulators of key signaling pathways often
disregulated in disease has resulted in their emergence as powerful therapeutic agents,
actively being evaluated for the treatment of multiple diseases (see Kasinski and Slack for a
review (17)). These small non-coding RNAs efficiently modulate the expression of protein
coding genes either through translational repression or target mRNA destabilization (18,19).
Because miRNAs bind their targets with imperfect sequence complementarity, an individual
miRNA is capable of affecting the expression of multiple genes. As such, the delivery of a
single miRNA is analogous to a multi-drug cocktail. Likewise, multiple miRNA binding
sites are regularly found in an individual target gene, decreasing the likelihood of acquired
resistance due to somatic mutations. Although the effect of an individual miRNA acting on a
single target may be subtle, the collective repression of tens to hundreds of genes can have a
significant impact on cells and produce strong phenotypic outcomes. This has been
confirmed for tumor-suppressive miR-34 and its respective target genes BCL2, MET, CDK4,
and c-MYC, as well as for let-7 and its targets KRAS, c-MYC, HMGA2, and the LIN28
isoforms (4,6,9,11,12,20). While the expression of miRNA target genes can vary in different
tissues and cells, the ability of a miRNA to target multiple key oncogenes makes miRNAs
an attractive therapeutic tool that is potentially more powerful than agents that target a single
gene.

Both let-7 and miR-34 function as tumor suppressors in NSCLC and can inhibit tumor
growth in a variety of model systems when used therapeutically as single agents.
Specifically, our groups and others have shown that exogenous let-7 can both prevent and
treat Kras-driven lung tumors (21–23), and that miR-34 can prevent initiation and
progression of KrasG12D+/;p53R172H/+ lung tumors and human NSCLC tumor xenografts
(24–26). Additional studies showed that miRNAs are effective therapeutically even if they
do not directly repress the mutant driver gene responsible for oncogenesis. Evidence comes
from Kras-activated tumors that are exposed to exogenous miR-34 (25,26); although
miR-34 is not expected to directly regulate Kras, there is a robust effect on Kras-activated
tumors treated with miR-34.

KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53flx/flx genetically engineered mice accurately model NSCLC, both in
disease progression, and response and resistance to conventional therapies (27–29). Since
tumor formation in this model depends on two or more signaling pathways that are
associated with let-7 and miR-34, we explored whether combining miR-34 and let-7 into a
single therapeutic could interfere with constitutively active processes in heterogeneous
cancer cells to induce greater treatment efficacy. We show that simultaneous
supplementation of these two tumor suppressor miRNAs results in an even broader
repression of key oncogenes and enhanced efficacy in aggressive NSCLC compared to
treatment with the individual miRNAs.

Results
miR-34 and let-7 synergize in NSCLC cells in culture

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the combined efficacy of these two master regulators, seven different lung
cancer cell lines were transfected with low nanomolar concentrations of let-7 or miR-34
individually, or half of the dose of each in combination. When transfected with let-7b or
miR-34a alone, proliferation of cells harboring both KRAS and TP53 open reading frame
(ORF) mutations (in cell lines: H358, H23, and H441) was decreased. Similarly, the
combination of half doses of let-7b and miR-34a was equally or, in some cases (H441),
more effective (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1). Cell lines with only a KRAS ORF
mutation (H460 and A549) or a TP53 mutation (EKVX) were less affected by the
combination. These data suggest that that the use of either miRNA alone or in combination
is effective in a KRAS;TP53 mutated background.

Additional analysis in H441 cells determined that the overall rate of proliferation was
decreased more strongly in cells transfected with half the dose of both miRNAs (Fig. 1B),
relative to cells transfected with let-7b or miR-34a individually. To determine whether cotreatment with let-7b and miR-34a results in a synergistic effect on cell proliferation, doseresponse curves and combination indices were calculated from proliferation data generated
from H441 and H23 cells. This analysis confirmed that let-7b and miR-34a synergize in
H441 cells (Fig. 1C) but act additively in H23 cells (data not shown). In H441 cells,
combination index (CI) scores were well below 1.0 when the effect size was greater than
15%, indicating a synergistic response (CI H441: at 25% growth inhibition = 0.65, at 20%
growth inhibition = 0.74, at 15% growth inhibition = 0.86). To better characterize the
cellular effects of treatment with the miRNA combination in H23 cells, we evaluated cell
migration through a matrigel-coated membrane following transfection. H23 cells transfected
with either let-7b or miR-34a individually were capable of invading equally well or better
than cells transfected with a control, scrambled miRNA (Fig. 1D). In contrast, H23 cells
exposed to the let-7b/miR-34a combination showed a reduction in their ability to invade (pvalues of let-7b and miR-34a transfected cells relative to: control = 0.06, let-7b = 0.07,
miR-34a = 0.004).
Tumor suppressor miRNAs often mediate their effects by targeting potent genes in key
oncogenic signaling pathways. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of LIN28B, MET
and MYC following transfection. MET is a bona fide miR-34 target (12) while MYC is
reported to be repressed by both miR-34 and let-7 (Wei:2008iz 10). let-7 also represses

LIN28 (20,30,31). Specifically in the cells transfected with miR-34a, MET levels were
reduced, and MYC and LIN28B were downregulated in cells transfected with let-7b. These
effects were also observed in cells transfected with half the dose of let-7b and miR-34a (Fig.
1E). Together, the results indicate that combinatorial treatment with let-7b and miR-34a
results in decreased levels of more key oncogenes than transfecting with either individual
miRNA, providing mechanistic evidence consistent with the tumor suppressive effect of
these miRNAs seen above.
Superior effects of the miR-34 and let-7 combination in NSCLC mouse models in vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Next we determined the anti-tumor activity of the let-7b/miR-34a combination in vivo, using
the KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53flx/flx NSCLC model. This model is the most accurate representation
of human NSCLC in disease progression, and response and resistance to conventional
therapies, making it an excellent model to use for our studies (27,28). To induce tumor
formation, transgenes in KrasLSL-G12D/;p53flx/flx mice were induced specifically in the lung
through intratracheal administration of 106 PFU of adenoviral particles expressing Cre
recombinase (Ad-Cre). Following transgene recombination, tumors developed at an
accelerated rate with defined nodules present in a subset of animals five weeks following
Ad-Cre delivery. Both miR-34 and let-7 levels were confirmed to be low in tumors relative
to the expression in normal lung tissue. MiR-34b and miR-34c levels were reduced to less
than 50% of the level found in normal lung tissue (Supplementary Fig. 2). let-7a, let-7b and
miR-34a levels were unchanged at ten weeks post transgene recombination; however, we
did observe a decrease in expression four weeks later for let-7b in both the lung tissue and in
the whole blood (Fig. 3, F and G; compare baseline to miR-NC). We likely did not observe a
decrease in miR-34a due to the overall low baseline levels of miR-34a in the whole lung
(Figure 3D). Interestingly, in the tumor tissue we also observed increased expression of the
oncomiRs miR-19, miR-155 and miR-21 (Supplementary Fig. 2). On average, miR-19 was
increased 5-fold, miR-155 approximately 4-fold, and miR-21 over 2-fold relative to normal
lung tissue.

We had previously identified a neutral lipid emulsion (NLE) delivery agent suitable for
systemic in vivo targeting to the lung (Max Suppressor, Bioo Scientific and Mirna
Therapeutics) that showed no obvious signs of toxicity (25,26). Therefore, we tested the
efficacy of NLE-encapsulated let-7b and miR-34a in the therapeutically resistant
KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53LSL-flx/flx mouse model. We treated animals ten weeks following
transgene recombination, systemically administering 1 mg/kg of NLE-encapsulated let-7b,
miR-34a, or half the dose of each into the tail vein. As a control, the NLE delivery agent
alone was also evaluated. Animals were dosed every other day (QOD) for a total of 11
doses, a time when the control animals and some of the miR-34a or let-7b individually
dosed animals became sick and died. The remaining animals were sacrificed either 24 or 48
hours following the final injection and evaluated for lung tumor burden and tumor number
(Fig. 2). A reduction in tumor nodules was only apparent when animals were administered
the combination of 0.5 mg/kg of let-7b and 0.5 mg/kg of miR-34a (Fig. 2C). In animals
treated with the combination, tumor burden decreased from 49% to 31% (Fig. 2D) and
tumor nodules decreased from an average of 17.6 to 8.25 nodules/left lobe (Fig 2C).
Because some animals were too sick to withstand the stress from the injections and died,

they were not included in the final histological data set and statistical power was reduced.
As such we conducted a larger and more powerful study to support use of the combinatorial
therapy.

The second in vivo study used a promising new lipid-based delivery agent, NOV340, that
accumulates in the lung, liver, and spleen of systemically treated mice (AGB, unpublished
data and Fig. 3, D and F). Equally important, the path to the clinic could be quickened as
this delivery agent showed limited toxicity in preclinical animal studies (32) and is currently
the subject of a Phase I clinical trial for MRX34, a NOV340 nanoparticle loaded with
miR-34a mimics to treat patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma or
individuals with unresectable liver metastasis (NCT01829971) (33). Due to the early demise
of some animals in the previous trial we started treatment of animals at seven weeks post
transgene activation instead of at the previous ten weeks. This allowed control animals to
survive through the completion of the study over the course of 14 total injections QOD (Fig.
4A). Similar to the previous studies, animals were administered let-7b, miR-34a or half the
dose of both miRNA mimics. Formulations were administered intravenously at 1 mg/kg per
injection, a dose well below levels that induce toxicities in mice (AGB, unpublished data).
Either 24 or 48 hours after the final injections, animals were sacrificed and evaluated for
tumor burden, signs of toxicity, accumulation of miRNAs in whole blood and lungs, and
relevant markers. As expected and in agreement with previous studies, there was no
evidence of whole organ toxicity or elevation in any of the serum cytokines TNFα, IL-6, and
IL-1b (Fig. 3A). Systemic delivery of the individual miRNAs led to marked accumulation of
miR-34a and let-7b in the lung (Fig. 3, D and F, p-value < 0.0001 for miR-34a and < 0.0001
for let-7b) and miR-34a in the whole blood (Fig. 3E, p-value < 0.0001) compared to miRNC treated mice. It is of interest to note that let-7b levels dropped in both the lung and
whole blood as the tumors progressed (Fig. 3, F and G: baseline animals relative to miR-NC
treated animals in lung, p-value = 0.001, and in whole blood, p-value = 0.034). This
suggests that let-7b expression decreases as the tumors progress and, furthermore, that our
systemic administration can restore the levels to at least baseline in the lung. The data for
miR-34a also indicate that miRNA levels correlated with miRNA dosing: animals that
received a full dose (1 mg/kg) had roughly twice as much miR-34a as animals that were
injected with the combination containing half the dose (0.5 mg/kg) of each miRNA. These
levels were sustained at least 48 hours after the last dose. We compared levels in animals
sacrificed 24 or 48 hours after the final injection (not shown), which revealed no significant
changes between the two time points.

Histological evaluation determined that overall tumor burden was reduced in animals that
were administered the combinatorial therapy (Fig. 4, B and C, and Supplementary Fig. 3).
The reduced tumor burden was attributed to a decrease in individual tumor size (Fig. 4D).
The combinatorial administration reduced tumor volume to less than 43% of the control
tumors (p-value = < 0.0001). Notably, average lung tumor volumes from the dual treated
animals were also significantly smaller than average volumes from either of the single
miRNA-treated groups (relative to miR-34a: p-value < 0.05, relative to let-7b: p-value <
0.01), suggesting that combinatorial treatment with let-7b and miR-34a has a significant
effect on tumor growth. In addition, we observed a decrease of Ki-67 staining in

combinatorial treated tumors, indicating that the tumors exposed to miR-34a and let-7b were
proliferating at a slower rate (Fig. 4, E and F).

Author Manuscript

Individual lung tumors that remained in each of the treatment arms were harvested and used
to evaluate the effects of miR-34a and let-7b on respective target genes (Supplementary Fig.
4). Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of Myc, Lin28A and Lin28B, three of the genes that
were expressed at higher levels in the tumor relative to negative control treated tissue (miRNC), were found to be downregulated by exogenous miR-34a and/or let-7b. Bcl2 and Met,
gene products that did not change during lung tumorigenesis, were also reduced by the
combinatorial treatment and miR-34a and/or let-7b. The results suggest that the delivery of
miRNA mimics was sufficient to repress their downstream targets. Importantly, the
collective response on target genes was sustained in the group treated with the combination,
showing that through combinatorial miRNA administration we were able to downregulate
more target genes than through the use of each miRNA alone. The relative decreases in the
transcript levels in vivo were similar to the reduced protein levels from the human cell
culture experiments (Fig. 1E).
miR-34 and let-7 improve survival in Kras; p53 mutant mice

Author Manuscript

Although a few lung agents with FDA approval lead to modestly increased survival in this
mouse model (27), no new clinically relevant agents have shown a similar benefit (29).
Therefore, because this mouse model is the most accurate representation of human response
to FDA-approved therapeutics, we sought to evaluate if the new combinatorial miRNA
therapy could increase the average survival of Kras;p53 mice. Transgenes were activated in
the lungs of the mice as before and tumors were allowed to develop for 6 weeks before
animals were separated into 4 treatment arms. Each animal received 10 mg/kg NOV340 per
intravenous miRNA injection, such that miRNAs administered alone were given at 10
mg/kg, and each miRNA in the combination was used at 5 mg/kg. Animals were dosed three
times per week (TIW) for a total of 8 weeks. At this time point, ~50% of the control animals
had died. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, shown in Figure 4G, demonstrate that there was a
clear survival advantage (~40% increase) for the animals administered the combination of
half miR-34 and half let-7b (p-value = 0.07), and for the miR-34a alone group (p-value =
0.05). Animals administered the control miRNA had a median survival of 57 days following
the first injection, and miR-34a treatment alone increased the median survival to 81 days.
While let-7b treatment alone had no effect on increasing survival (median of 55 days),
animals administered the half-dose combinatorial therapy had a median survival of 78 days.
Together, these results indicate that treatment with miR-34a or the half dose combination of
let-7b and miR-34a can increase average survival in this model of aggressive NSCLC.

Discussion
The study we present here is one of the first to show that a combination of two biologically
relevant, tumor-suppressive miRNAs is superior in its ability to repress oncogene
expression, preventing proliferation and invasion of cancer cells in culture, to inhibit tumor
proliferation in vivo, and to confer a survival advantage. Half the dose of each of these
miRNAs was capable of repressing relevant biological targets in cells and in vivo, yet

exhibited undetectable toxicity. We have performed these timely in vivo studies using a
miRNA-delivery agent already in clinical trials, which should accelerate the translation of
this combinatorial miRNA therapeutic approach into the clinic. While it still needs to be
explored, it is expected that the tumors exposed to the combinatorial therapy could now be
more sensitive to conventional therapies based on the coordinated downregulation of both
let-7 and miR-34 target genes involved in chemoresistance, relative to the individually dosed
animals. Furthermore, it is expected that this miRNA combination, which hits multiple
relevant biological targets, would prevent the onset of acquired resistance that has been
observed with other therapies tested in this model (29).

Author Manuscript

While the study presented here shows a similar effect on survival between animals exposed
to the full dose of miR-34a or those treated with half the dose of miR-34a and let-7b, this
effect may be attributed to the low levels of miR-34a in the baseline treated animals. When
the miRNAs are supplemented, the change in miR-34a levels is much larger than that of
let-7b, which does not change strongly (Figure 3, D–G). It is possible that in this
experimental system the net effect of the large change in miR-34a levels is driving the
survival effect. It is however likely that the combinatorial treatment would display increased
efficacy in humans by impairing the development of secondary resistance. The accumulation
of mutations in human tumors may render the tumor resistant to a single agent. By
simultaneously targeting multiple key factors in the oncogenic response, the combinatorial
approach presented here will likely diminish the occurrence of acquired resistance.
Collectively, this is a first step in the progression towards the adoption of a combinatorial
miRNA approach as a less toxic and more direct method to target multiple biologically
relevant pathways that tumor cells have become addicted to.

Methods
Cells Culture and Transfection

Author Manuscript

All cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in RPMI media (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin,
following standard tissue culture procedures. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified
5% CO2 environment and passaged every 3–4 days. Cells were transfected with miRNA
mimics (Ambion, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) using DharmaFECT1 (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For SRB experiments, 1,000 cells were seeded per well in
96-well cell culture dishes. The following day either 25 or 50 nM final concentration of
miRNA mimics in various combinations was complexed with 0.5 μL of DharmaFECT 1 and
added to the cells in a final volume of 100 μL of serum- and antibiotic-free media.
Transfection media was replaced with complete growth media four hours later. In all cases
control miRNA was supplemented in to keep the entire miRNA level consistent between
transfection conditions. For protein lysate retrieval, cells were seeded in 24-well plates and
transfected as above except that the DharmaFECT 1 concentration was increased to 2 μL/
well.

Trans-well migration assays

Author Manuscript

Transfected H23 cells plated at 1 × 105 in 100 μL serum-free medium were assayed for
migration using BD BioCoat Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
with 8 micron pores, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serum-containing media
was added to the outside of the chamber to act as a chemoattractant. Briefly, cells were
incubated for 24 hours to allow for migration across the pores, washed with PBS, treated
with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, washed again, and then treated with methanol. After
another wash, a 1:20 dilution of Giemsa stain was used to stain the cells, before the cells
were washed a final time. Migrating cells were imaged at 10X magnification. For
quantification, three fields of view for each transfection were counted and averaged. Three
biological replicates were performed.
Protein extraction and immunoblotting

Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (1 x PBS, 1%
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate), supernatant was
collected, 50 μg of protein was resolved on 12% TGX gels (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA) and
transferred to PVDF membranes. Primary antibodies for detection included Lin28B (1:500,
Cell Signaling 4196), Met (1:500, Cell Signaling 3127), and Myc-Xp (1:500, Cell Signaling,
5605). Following incubation with secondary antibodies, membranes were washed and signal
was acquired using West Dura (Promega) and exposure of membranes to film. Intensities
were quantified using ImageJ Software (NIH) (34).
Kras;p53 animals, induction of tumor formation, and treatment

Author Manuscript

Both KrasLSL-G12D/+ (strain 01XJ6) and Trp53flx/flx (strain 01XC2) mice were obtained from
the NCI Frederick Mouse Repository. The Kras allele was crossed into the Trp53
background, FVB.129. Newly acquired double heterozygotes were backcrossed to the Trp53
strain for four generations before homozygosing the Trp53flx allele. Transgenes in double
mutant animals were induced based on the method of DuPage et al (28). Briefly, animals
were anesthetized with a mix of ketamine and xylazine and intratracheally intubated.
Adenoviral particles (106 PFU) encoding for Cre-recombinase were precipitated with CaCl2
and 65 μL of precipitated virus was delivered directly to the lungs through the catheter.
In all cases miRNA mimics were delivered systemically through the tail-vein. The neutral
lipid emulsion (NLE) was prepared as previously described (26). Mimics encapsulated in
NOV340 were supplied by Mirna Therapeutics. For tumor burden studies, following
transgene recombination, animals were administered either 1mg/kg of NLE-encapsulated
miRNA mimics every other day for a total of 11 injections or 1mg/kg of mimics

encapsulated in NOV340 every other day for a total of 14 injections. Twenty-four or fortyeight hours after the final injection animals were sacrificed. Whole blood and serum were
obtained and lungs were perfused with saline, harvested, fixed in 10% buffered formalin and
paraffin embedded according to standard procedures. Sections were stained by hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) and evaluated using a Zeiss dissection microscope, AxioCam MRc 5
camera, and AxioVision 4.7.1 imaging software. Tumor burden represents the tumor area
relative to the total lung area obtained from three independent sections for each animal. For
survival studies 10 mg/kg of miRNA mimics (5mg/kg of let-7b and miR-34a for the
combination) were delivered systemically through the tail vein TIW for 8 weeks. Animal
survival was monitored throughout the remainder of the study. Log-rank tests were
performed to determine significance. All animals were housed in the Yale University
Animal Facility under the guidelines held by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.

once in 70% alcohol, twice in 95% alcohol, and three times in 100% alcohol. Slides were
dipped three times in xylene and coverslipped using Richard-Allen Scientific Mounting
Medium (Thermo Scientific, MA). KI-67 positive cells, in 2mm sections, were counted and
averaged across all animals in the treatment arm.

Total RNA from whole blood and tissues was isolated using the mirVana PARIS RNA
isolation kit (Ambion, TX) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 250 μL of
blood lysate (250 μL whole blood + 250 μL RNA denaturing solution) or 600 μL of tissue
homogenate (1 mL RNA denaturing solution added to slightly thawed tissue sample and
homogenized) was combined with an equal volume of acid-phenol, vortexed, and
centrifuged at 13.2k × g for 15 minutes. One half of the resultant aqueous phase was
transferred to a fresh tube and the remaining protocol was followed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. A volume of 50 μL of heated (95°C), nuclease-free water was
used to elute the RNA from the column.
For the detection and quantification of miRNA from whole lungs and blood by qRT-PCR,
isolated RNA was converted to cDNA using MMLV-RT (Invitrogen, CA) under the
following conditions: 4°C for 15 min; 16°C for 30 min; 42°C for 30 min; 85°C for 5 min.

TaqMan microRNA assays were used for expression analysis of hsa-miR-34a and hsa-let-7b
(Life Technologies, CA). Following cDNA synthesis, qPCR was performed on 2 μL of
cDNA on the ABI Prism 7900HT SDS (Life Technologies) using Platinum Taq Polymerase
(Invitrogen) under the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 1 min (initial denature); then
50 cycles of 95°C for 5 sec, 60°C for 30 sec. Additions to the manufacturers’ reagents
include DMSO (final concentration of 6%) and tetramethylammoniumchloride (TMAC;
final concentration of 50 mM in both RT and PCR) to improve the slope, linearity and
sensitivity of the assays.

Absolute quantitation was determined as copy number per nanogram of RNA input by
extrapolation to the miR-34a and let-7b standard curves. Final values were calculated by
factoring in losses during the acid-phenol extraction (carry-over of only half of the aqueous
phase), elution volume, volume of RNA eluent into the reverse transcription reaction and
starting mass of RNA.
For the detection and quantification of miRNAs and mRNA targets by qRT-PCR from
individual lung tumors, isolated RNA was converted to cDNA using miScript II RT Kit
(Qiagen). Following cDNA synthesis, qPCR was performed on 2 μL of cDNA on the Roche
480 using Qiagen’s miScript SYBR Green Assay Kit. Qiagen probes were used for
expression analysis of all genes of interest. Relative quantification of miR-34a and let-7b
and their targets was determined as the concentration (fold-change) of the genes of interest
compared to the normal lung tissue. Rnu6B (miRNA), and Gapdh and Actin (mRNA) were
used as housekeeping genes to normalize for RNA input variances into the reverse
transcription reaction.
Serum cytokines

Mice serum samples were used to test for IL-6, IL-1b and TNF-α concentrations using the
cytokine assay kit from R&D systems according to manufacturer’s instructions (Fluorokine
MAP Mouse Base Kit Cat# LUM000, mouse IL-1b Cat# LUM401, mouse IL-6 Cat#
LUM406, mouse TNF-α Cat# LUM410). Briefly, serum samples were thawed and cleared
from debris by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 minutes prior to analysis. All samples or
standards were added to a 96-well plate together with assay buffer, and cytokine beads.
Plates were gently shaked for 3 hours at room temperature and spun as above. After removal
of the supernatant, wells were washed. A detection antibody was added and the plates were
incubated 1 hour at RT with shaking. Plates were rinsed and incubated with streptavidinphycoerythrin for 30 minutes at RT. The wells were washed and the capture beads were resuspended to acquire data using the Luminex 100 IS2.2 detection system. Cytokine standard
curves were used to calculate the cytokine concentrations in serum samples [pg/mL].

Significance
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerous deaths worldwide, with non-small cell lung
cancer making up the bulk of newly identified cases. Unfortunately, current therapeutics
fail to treat the majority of individuals with this disease, even when using recently
developed targeted therapeutics. Primary or secondary resistance from targeted agents
can be attributed to acquired mutations in the target that render the initial therapeutic less
effective or ineffective and/or compensatory mutations in other pathways that allow the
cancer cells to overcome the effects of the targeted therapy. Combinatorial microRNA
therapeutics is a new frontier in gene therapy that has the ability to overcome these
challenges by targeting multiple components of key oncogenic pathways.
