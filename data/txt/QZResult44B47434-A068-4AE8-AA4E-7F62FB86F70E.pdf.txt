in normal cells (4, 6). The most important interaction within the
Hsp90 chaperone system is between Hsp90(a/h) and p23, which
occurs only when Hsp90 is in the ATP bound form. Hsp90/p23
interactions are important for assembly of functional Hsp90/client
proteins complex, release of client proteins, and disassembly of
transcriptionally active complex (2, 3).
Small molecule inhibitors have been developed to inhibit Hsp90
ATPase activity by targeting its ATP-binding pocket (2, 7–9). These
inhibitors have higher binding affinities to Hsp90 in cancer
compared with that of normal cells (6). They preclude p23 binding
to Hsp90 and lead to misfolding, partly by competitively blocking
ATP binding to Hsp90. The subsequent degradation of the
misfolded proteins leads to simultaneous inhibition of multiple
signal transduction pathways and cell growth arrest. The two
classes of Hsp90 inhibitors that are in advanced developmental
stages are the geldanamycin-based and the purine-scaffold Hsp90
inhibitors. Two of the geldanamycin-based Hsp90 inhibitors,
17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), are
now in phase I/phase II clinical trials for patients with advanced
malignancies (10–12). Likewise, purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitors
have also been rationally designed and are in both advanced
preclinical and phase I clinical evaluation (12, 9).
The investigation of Hsp90/p23 interactions has been limited to
in vitro analyses, such as binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation (13–15). These methods are sensitive to the ionic strength of
the detergents/buffers and may not accurately reflect the nature of
interactions between Hsp90/p23 in intact living cells. Phenotypic
assays have also been developed to examine the downstream
effects of the inhibition of Hsp90/p23 interactions (i.e., degradation
of Hsp90 client proteins) by different Hsp90 inhibitors (7, 16–19).
Some of these Hsp90 inhibitors have shown efficacy for growth
inhibition in cell culture and xenograft models in living mice (9, 19).
Recently, a noninvasive imaging method was developed to monitor
Her2 degradation by Hsp90 inhibitors in a breast cancer xenograft
model (20). In spite of these advances, longitudinal studies for
monitoring the efficacies of Hsp90 inhibitors cannot be achieved
noninvasively without sacrificing the mice at each time point
before excision of tumors for in vitro analyses. Furthermore,
because both Hsp90 isoforms (a and h) are expressed in cancer
cells, it is not possible to decipher the individual contribution of
each isoform in determining the sensitivity of Hsp90 inhibitors.
To examine the contribution of isoform-selective Hsp90a/p23
and Hsp90h/p23 interactions in tumor responsiveness to Hsp90
inhibitors noninvasively in cell culture and living mice, we used
genetically encoded reporters that are based on split Renilla
luciferase (RL) protein fragment–assisted complementation
(SRL-PFAC) developed by our laboratory (21–23). This system is
based on the complementation of two inactive halves of the

Abstract
Heat shock protein 90A (Hsp90A)/p23 and Hsp90B/p23
interactions are crucial for proper folding of proteins involved
in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Small molecule
Hsp90 inhibitors block Hsp90A/p23 and Hsp90B/p23 interactions in part by preventing ATP binding to Hsp90. The
importance of isoform-selective Hsp90A/p23 and Hsp90B/p23
interactions in determining the sensitivity to Hsp90 was
examined using 293T human kidney cancer cells stably
expressing split Renilla luciferase (RL) reporters. Interactions
between Hsp90A/p23 and Hsp90B/p23 in the split RL
reporters led to complementation of RL activity, which was
determined by bioluminescence imaging of intact cells in cell
culture and living mice using a cooled charge-coupled device
camera. The three geldanamycin-based and seven purinescaffold Hsp90 inhibitors led to different levels of inhibition of
complemented RL activities (10–70%). However, there was no
isoform selectivity to both classes of Hsp90 inhibitors in cell
culture conditions. The most potent Hsp90 inhibitor, PU-H71,
however, led to a 60% and 30% decrease in RL activity (14 hr)
in 293T xenografts expressing Hsp90A/p23 and Hsp90B/p23
split reporters respectively, relative to carrier control–treated
mice. Molecular imaging of isoform-specific Hsp90A/p23 and
Hsp90B/p23 interactions and efficacy of different classes of
Hsp90 inhibitors in living subjects have been achieved with a
novel genetically encoded reporter gene strategy that should
help in accelerating development of potent and isoformselective Hsp90 inhibitors. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):216–26]

Introduction
Protein-protein interactions play very important roles in
different biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death (1). However, proteins must be properly folded
before they can interact with each other. In mammalian cells,
protein folding is mediated by the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)
chaperone system, including Hsp90 and the cochaperones p23, Hip,
Hop, and Hsp70 (2, 3). Overexpression of Hsp90 in human cancers
correlates with poor prognosis (4, 5). Hsp90 interacts strongly with
the cochaperones as a fully active multichaperone complex (6), and
its ATP affinity and ATPase activity in cancer cells are higher than

the c-myc peptide sequences (EQKLISEEDL) were incorporated into the
XhoI reverse primer to use in conjunction with the Hsp90h Nhe1 forward
primer for PCR cloning.
Cell culture. All cell lines used in this study were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection. Human 293T embryonic kidney cancer
cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin solutions.
Cell transfection, FL, and RL assays. Transfections were performed in
80% confluent 24-h-old cultures of 293T. For transfection, 250 ng/well of
pcDNA molar equivalent of each split RL reporters, full-length RL, were
used in 12-well tissue culture plates, and 5 AL Lipofectamine 2000 was
used per transfection. pcDNA3.1(+) vector (5 ng) expressing full-length FL
was cotransfected per well to normalize for transfection efficiency. The
cells were assayed after 24-h incubation at 37jC at 5% CO2. The luminometer assays for FL and RL activity were performed as previously described (21, 22, 24). Protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined
by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). RL activities were normalized for protein
content and transfection efficiency using FL activity and expressed as
relative light units per microgram protein per minute of counting (RLU/Ag
protein/min).
Selection of 293T cells stably expressing NRL(M185V)-p23/
Hsp90A2.2-CRL and NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90B2.2-CRL and evaluation
of the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors in cell culture. Eighty percent
confluent 293T cells were cotransfected with 5 Ag each of pcDNA3.1+
plasmids expressing NRL(M185V)-p23 with Hsp90a2.2-CRL or
NRL(M185V)-p23 with Hsp90h2.2-CRL for 24 h, before replating in
1.5 Ag/mL of puromycin hydrochloride to allow formation of individual
colonies. To screen for 293T cells expressing both Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/
p23 split RL reporters, cell culture medium was aspirated, 3 Ag coelenterazine diluted in 3 mL of PBS were added, and bioluminescence
imaging was performed using the IVIS 50 imaging system (Xenogen Corp.)
with an acquisition time of 3 min. Positive colonies with the highest RL
activities were trypsinized and transferred to individual wells in a 24-well
plate and grown in MEM containing 1.5 Ag/mL of puromycin.
To determine the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on complementation of
Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 in intact cells, 3.5  104 293T cells stably
transfected with split RL reporters [NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90a-CRL and
NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h-CRL] were plated in each well in the 96-well
black well plate (Costar) and allowed to attach for 24 h before treatment
with different concentrations of the geldanamycin-based and purinescaffold Hsp90 inhibitors for 24 h. EnduRen live cell substrate (10 Ag/mL;
diluted in 50 AL of medium) was added to each well for 1.5 h, and RL
activities were determined by bioluminescence imaging. Cell number in
each well was determined by sulforhodamine B assay as previously
described (28). Complemented RL activities were normalized for cell
number and to that of cells treated with carrier controls (0.12% DMSO for
geldanamycin, 17-AAG, 17-DMAG, PU3, PU24FCL, PU-H58, PU-L66, and
PU-DZ7; 0.012% DMSO for PU-H71 and PU-DZ8).
Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation. Coimmunoprecipitation of NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc was performed with the
agarose-conjugated goat anti-myc antibody (Bethyl Laboratories). Agaroseconjugated goat IgG was used as a negative control. 293T cells were
transiently cotransfected with 5 Ag each of NRL(M185V)-p23 and
Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc and treated with different concentrations of PU-H71
for 24 h before lysis with 0.1% NP40 buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
25 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L DTT, 20 mmol/L Na2MoO4, and 0.1% NP40] for
2 h at 4jC on a rotating platform. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation
at 1.3  104  g for 15 min at 4jC. The RL activity for each sample was
determined by luminometer assay, whereas protein concentrations were
determined by Bradford assay. RL activities in PU-H71–treated cells were
normalized to that of carrier control–treated cells (as 100%). Three hundred
micrograms of the total cell lysates were incubated with 20 AL of agaroseconjugated goat IgG or goat anti-myc antibody for 3 h on a rotating
platform at 4jC. The beads were washed four times with ice-cold lysis
buffer, and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 20 AL of 2 Tris
(2-carboxy-ethyl)-phosphin-HCl (TCEP) buffer [156 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
50 mmol/L Tris base (Sigma), 12.5 mmol/L TCEP HCl (Pierce), 0.006%

full-length RL mediated by the interaction between two positively
interacting proteins. SRL-PFAC was previously used to monitor
heterodimerization between MyoD/Id (24), homodimerization of
herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (23), and rapamycinmediated mTOR/FKBP12 interactions (22), both in cell culture
and living mice by optical bioluminescence imaging.
The SRL-PFAC system is advantageous because (a) the
interaction of each Hsp90 isoform (a/h) with p23 can be
individually monitored; (b) signal amplification is achieved through
the enzymatic properties of complemented RL activity; (c) RL
exhibits flash kinetics (25) and, thus, provides a real-time
monitoring of Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 interactions; (d)
SRL-PFAC has a high signal to background ratio and potentially
less steric hindrance due to the small size of RL fragments (NRL, 23
kDa; CRL, 13 kDa); (e) RL does not require ATP for its activity, thus
important for screening inhibitors that target the ATP-binding
pocket of Hsp90; ( f ) the fusion constructs can be optimized and
validated in cell culture before generation of stable cells; and (g )
repetitive imaging of the same mouse allows dynamic indirect
monitoring of Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 interactions in
response to treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors, wherein the
pharmacokinetic properties of each Hsp90 inhibitor influence
efficacy.
In the current work, we implemented the SRL-PFAC system to
indirectly examine the kinetics of Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23
interactions and showed its feasibility in monitoring both in cell
culture and in small living subjects the efficacy and isoform
selectivity of Hsp90 inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, enzymes, and reagents. The pET3a vectors encoding the
cDNA for human Hsp90a, Hsp90h, p23, and a p23 (F103A) mutant were
gifts from Dr. David Toft (Mayo Clinic). The plasmids pCMV-hRL encoding
the full-length synthetic RL and pCMV-FL encoding the full-length firefly
luciferase (FL), LARII substrate for FL assay, and 5 passive lysis buffer,
EnduRen Live Cell Substrate, were purchased from Promega. Restriction
enzymes, modification enzymes, and ligase were purchased from New
England Biolabs. TripleMaster TaqDNA polymerase for PCR amplification
was purchased from Brinkmann Eppendorf. Site-directed mutagenesis
was performed using the Stratagene kit. Amplicillin and kanamycin for
bacterial culture, DMSO were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid extraction
kits and DNA gel extraction kits were purchased from Qiagen. Coelenterazine was purchased from Nanolight Technology. All animal cell culture
media, fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics streptomycin and penicillin,
and plastic wares for cell cultures, bacterial culture media, Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagents, and 4% to 12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels
were purchased from Invitrogen. Geldanamycin, 17-AAG, 17-DMAG, and
puromycin hydrochloride (100 mg/mL) were purchased from Invivogen.
Geldanamycin, 17-AAG, and 17-DMAG were dissolved in DMSO as stock
solutions (1 mg/mL), aliquoted, and stored at 20jC. Purine-scaffold Hsp90
inhibitors were synthesized as previously reported (16, 26, 27), dissolved
as 100 mmol/L DMSO stock, and stored at 20jC.
Construction of plasmids. The NH2 terminal portion (NRL, amino acids
1–229) and COOH terminal portion (CRL, amino acids 230–311) of the
hRluc gene was PCR amplified as described before (21–25). The full-length
human Hsp90a and a full-length p23 (F103A) mutant and Hsp90h
fragments (corresponding to amino acids 1–486 and full length) were
amplified using the forward primers designed with Nhe1 or BamH1 and the
corresponding reverse primers designed with BamH1 or XhoI with a stop
codon and were subcloned upstream or downstream of NRL or CRL using
corresponding restriction enzymes. Mutageneses of Hsp90h were performed using the Stratagene mutagenesis kit and confirmed by direct
sequencing. To attach a Myc-tag to the COOH terminus of Hsp90h2.2-CRL,

Figure 1. SRL-PFAC was sensitive and specific for indirect monitoring of Hsp90/p23 interactions. A, schematic diagram for monitoring Hsp90/p23 interaction
using the SRL-PFAC. The two interacting proteins p23 and Hsp90 were fused to the NRL (amino acids 1–229) and CRL (amino acids 230–311) portion of the RL through
an EF and (G4S)2 peptide linker, respectively (top ). In the presence of ATP, p23/Hsp90 interactions brought NRL and CRL in close proximity and led to complementation
of RL enzyme activity and photon production in the presence of the substrate coelenterazine. Binding of Hsp90 inhibitors (I) to Hsp90-CRL leads to a conformation
change and prevents ATP from binding, thus diminishing the interaction between NRL-p23 and Hsp90-CRL and complementation of RL activity. B, structure of

of Hsp90/p23 split RL reporter was orientation specific. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids expressing the Hsp90h1.4 and p23 fused to NRL and
CRL in eight possible orientations. FL was transfected to control for transfection efficiency. RL and FL activities were determined by luminometer assays 24
h posttransfection and normalized for protein content. Cotransfection of NRL-p23/Hsp90h1.4-CRL led to RL activity that was significantly higher than that of pcDNA
vector control–transfected cells (P < 0.05). 293T cells transfected with full-length RL were used as a positive control. Columns, mean; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05;

and NRL-Id/Hsp90h1.4-CRL) and a p23 (F103A) mutant that does not interact with Hsp90 [NRL-p23(F103A)/Hsp90h1.4-CRL]. RL and FL activities were determined as
described in B. Columns, mean; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.005 relative to 293T cells transiently cotransfected with NRL-p23/Hsp90h1.4-CRL (normalized to

using blue films (Midwest Scientific). The quantitation of coimmunoprecipitation was performed as follows: the band intensities of Hsp90h2.2-CRLMyc and NRL(M185V)-p23 from the Myc-Ab beads lanes (treated with
carrier control or PU-H71) were quantitated using NIH imaging J. The ratio
of the intensities [Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc/NRL(M185V)-p23] was normalized
to that of the carrier control–treated cells (as 100%).
Optical charge-coupled device imaging in living mice. Animal
handling was performed in accordance with Stanford University Animal
Research Committee guidelines. Mice were gas anesthetized using
isofluorane (2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen, 1 L/min) during all injection
and imaging procedures. Mice were imaged using a cooled charge-coupled
device (CCD) camera (Xenogen IVIS29; Xenogen Corp.). 293T cells
(5  106) stably cotransfected with NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90a2.2-CRL or
NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL were implanted s.c. in the bottom left and
right flanks of each female nude mouse of 7 weeks old (nu/nu, Charles River),

bromophenol blue (w/v), 24% glycerol (v/v), and 5% SDS (w/v)] at room
temperature for 15 min. Eluted proteins were resolved on a 4% to 12%
SDS-PAGE gradient gel and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane
(Schleicher & Schuell). The expression of split RL fusion constructs and
Hsp70 was determined by Western blotting using 1 of 10 of the input for
coimmunoprecipitation (30 Ag of total protein). The membranes were
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 for
1 h and probed overnight at 4jC on a rotating platform with mouse
monoclonal antibody against RL (1:1,000 dilution; Chemicon) or Myc-Tag
(Clone 9B11), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human Hsp70 (both
1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling), and mouse monoclonal antibody against
human a-tubulin (1:5,000 dilution, Clone B-5-1-2, Sigma). Secondary
antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit
IgG (1:3,000 dilution for both; Cell Signaling). Immunoblots were developed
using the LumiGlo enhanced chemiluminescence method (Cell Signaling)

respectively, for 14 days for tumor establishment. To determine RL activity in
the implanted tumors in living mice, 3 Ag of coelenterazine in
5% ethanol:95% PBS ( final volume, 100 AL) were injected via tail vein,
and the mice were immediately imaged with the IVIS system with an
acquisition time of 3 min. The animals were placed prone in a light-tight
chamber, and a gray scale reference image was obtained under low-level
illumination. Photons emitted from cells implanted in the mice were
collected and integrated for 3 min. Images were obtained using Living Image
Software (Xenogen Corp.) and Igor Image Analysis Software (Wavemetrics).
To quantify the measured light, the maximum photons per second per
square centimeter per steradian were obtained over regions of implanted
cells as validated previously. One of the sets were i.p. injected with 200 AL of
75 mg/kg of PU-H71 dissolved in 6.7% DMSO/PBS or 6.7% DMSO/PBS as
carrier control. At 6 and 14 h later, 30 Ag of coelenterazine were injected in
the tail vein for follow-up imaging of the effects of the Hsp90 inhibitors on
complemented RL activity, as described above. Max photons at 6 and
14 h were normalized to that of at 0 h for each individual mouse and
expressed as average max photons F SE.

Data analysis. Each experiment was repeated at least thrice, and results
were expressed as mean F SE. Statistical differences were determined by
Student’s t test using P < 0.05 as cutoff point.

Results
SRL-PFAC system was specific for indirect monitoring of
Hsp90B/p23 interactions. We tested the hypothesis that SRLPFAC can be used to indirectly monitor interactions between p23
and each of the Hsp90 isoforms (Fig. 1A, top). In the presence of
ATP, interactions between Hsp90 and p23 bring the two inactive
halves of full-length RL (NRL and CRL) in close proximity, leading
to complementation of RL activity and photon production in the
presence of the RL substrate coelenterazine (Fig. 1A, middle). To
determine if inhibition of Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 interactions would lead to reduction in complemented RL activity, we
made use of geldanamycin, two geldanamycin derivatives (17-AAG

CRL or NRL(WT)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL (P < 0.05 in both cases).
The specificity of RL complementation was also shown using the
NRL(M185V)-p23(F103A) mutant construct. Compared with
pcDNA vector control–transfected cells, NRL(M185V)-p23/
Hsp90a2.2-CRL–transfected and NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2CRL–transfected cells led to signal to background ratios of f12
and 14, respectively (data not shown).
SRL-PFAC was specific for indirect monitoring of disruption
of Hsp90B/p23 interactions by Hsp90 inhibitors. To determine
if SRL-PFAC can be used to indirectly monitor disruption of Hsp90/
p23 interactions by Hsp90 inhibitors, 293T cells transiently
cotransfected with NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL were treated
with the purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitor PU-DZ7 for 24 h before
analysis of RL activity. The specificity of using NRL(M185V)-p23/
Hsp90h-CRL was confirmed using Hsp90h2.2(K107A)-CRL,
Hsp90h2.2(K111A)-CRL, and Hsp90h2.2(K107AK111A)-CRL
mutant fusion constructs. These mutations are analogous to the
K111A mutation in chicken Hsp90a that reduces binding to
geldanamycin (29). Figure 3A shows that PU-DZ7 lead to greater
reduction in complemented RL activity of 293T cells cotransfected
with NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL compared with that of
NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2(K107A)-CRL or NRL(M185V)-p23/
Hsp90h2.2(K107AK111A)-CRL (P < 0.05 at 100 nmol/L and
200 nmol/L of PU-DZ7). Furthermore, complemented RL activity
in 293T cells transiently transfected with NRL(M185V)-p23/
Hsp90h2.2(K111A)-CRL was insensitive to the effect of PU-DZ7
(P < 0.05 at all PU-DZ7 concentrations).
To validate SRL-PFAC for indirectly monitoring Hsp90a/p23 and
Hsp90h/p23 interactions, a myc-tag was appended to Hsp90h2.2CRL as Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc to facilitate its detection by coimmunoprecipitation and western blotting. 293T cells transiently
cotransfected with NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc were
treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 (Fig. 1B) for 24 h before
coimmunoprecipitation of Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc with Myc polyclonal antibodies. Treatment with PU-H71 decreased association
between NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc compared with
carrier control–treated cells (Fig. 3B), which also correspond to
decrease in complemented RL activity (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of
cellular Hsp90 by PU-H71 was confirmed by an increase in the
expression of Hsp70, which is a feed-back mechanism characteristic of Hsp90 inactivation (33). The activity of PU-H71 was
confirmed by the increased expression of Hsp70 in PU-H71–treated
cells compared with that of carrier control cells. Furthermore,
the protein expression of both NRL(M185V)-p23 and Hsp90h2.2CRL-Myc was not significantly affected by PU-H71 (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that the decrease in complemented RL activity was
due to inhibition of NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc interactions per se instead of decreased expression of either split RL
reporter. Thus, SRL-PFAC was specific for indirect monitoring of
disruption of Hsp90h/p23 interactions by Hsp90 inhibitors.
Because the ATP-binding domains of Hsp90a and Hsp90h are
highly conserved (34), we therefore proceeded with NRL(M185V)p23/Hsp90a2.2-CRL and NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL for
subsequent experiments.
SRL-PFAC reveals differential sensitivities of Hsp90A/p23
and Hsp90B/p23 interactions to geldanamycin-based and
purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitors. To circumvent the variability
in expression of the Hsp90/p23 split reporters in transient
transfection studies (Figs. 1–3), 293T cells were stably transfected
with the constructs expressing NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90a2.2-CRL
or NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL. To evaluate the efficacy of

and 17-DMAG), and seven purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitors
(Fig. 1B). Binding of geldanamycin-based and purine-scaffold
Hsp90 inhibitors to Hsp90 leads to conformation changes in
Hsp90 that prevents ATP binding, thus precludes Hsp90 from
interacting with p23 and reduces complementation of NRL/CRL
and RL activity (Fig. 1A, bottom). To create fusion constructs
expressing p23 and Hsp90, full-length human p23 and the human
1.4 kb Hsp90h fragment (29) were subcloned upstream or
downstream of NRL and CRL fragments. These constructs were
transiently cotransfected in pairs into 293T human embryonic
kidney cancer cells to determine the orientation that led to the
highest complementation of RL activity, relative to pcDNA vector
control and full-length RL-transfected cells. Because the substrates
of RL (coelenterazine) and FL (D-luciferin) do not cross-react (30),
a pcDNA vector expressing FL was cotransfected to normalize for
transfection efficiency.
Among the eight possible orientations of fusion constructs,
cotransfection of NRL-p23/Hsp90h1.4-CRL led to the highest RL
activity (Fig. 1C) compared with cells transfected with pcDNA
vector control (P < 0.05). Similar results were observed in MCF-7
human breast cancer cells, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, and
Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). To determine the
specificity of NRL-p23/Hsp901.4h-CRL interactions, 293T cells were
transiently cotransfected with constructs expressing noninteracting protein partners of NRL-p23/MyoD-CRL or NRL-Id/Hsp90h1.4CRL. Furthermore, a human p23(F103A) mutant that does not
interact with chicken Hsp90a (31) was incorporated into NRL as
NRL-p23(F103A) and transiently cotransfected with Hsp90h1.4CRL into 293T cells. Figure 1D shows that RL activity in 293T
cells transiently cotransfected with NRL-p23/Hsp90h1.4-CRL was
significantly higher than that of cells cotransfected with noninteracting protein partners of NRL-p23/MyoD-CRL, NRL-Id/Hsp90hCRL (P < 0.05 in both cases), or NRL-p23(F103A)/Hsp90h1.4-CRL
(P < 0.005). All together, our data support that SRL-PFAC was
specific for indirect monitoring of Hsp90h/p23 interactions.
Full-length Hsp90A and Hsp90B in CRL and M185V
mutation in NRL further increased sensitivity of SRL-PFAC
for monitoring Hsp90/p23 interactions. Constitutive dimerization in the COOH terminus of purified full-length human Hsp90a
was shown to enhance p23 binding (32). To determine if higher
levels of complemented RL activity can be achieved using fulllength Hsp90h and Hsp90a (both 2.2 kb), Hsp90a2.2-CRL and
Hsp90h2.2-CRL fusion constructs were transiently cotransfected
with NRL-p23. Figure 2A shows that cotransfection of NRL-p23
with Hsp90a2.2-CRL or Hsp90h2.2-CRL led to a 2-fold and 3- fold
increase in complemented RL activities, respectively, compared
with that of NRL-p23/Hsp90h1.4-CRL. Specificity of NRL-p23/
Hsp90a2.2-CRL and NRL-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL complemented
RL activity was confirmed using the NRL-p23 (F103A) mutant
control (P < 0.001). Transient transfection of Hsp90a2.2-CRL and
Hsp90h2.2-CRL alone led to similar background RL activity
compared with that of Hsp90h1.4-CRL (P > 0.05).
The M185V mutation in RL was shown to increase photon
production by f3-fold, without significant changes in serum
stability (25). To determine if incorporation of the M185V mutation
into NRL-p23 fusion construct would lead to higher complemented
RL activity, NRL(M185V)-p23 was transiently cotransfected with
Hsp90a2.2-CRL or Hsp90h2.2-CRL. Figure 2B shows that transient
cotransfection of Hsp90a2.2-CRL (left) or Hsp90h2.2-CRL (right)
with NRL(M185V)-p23 led to a 1.5-fold increase in complemented
RL activity compared with that of NRL(WT)-p23/Hsp90a2.2-

Molecular Imaging of Hsp90/p23 Interactions

Figure 3. SRL-PFAC was specific for evaluation of the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors in disruption of NRL-p23/Hsp90h-CRL interactions. A, specificity of Hsp90
inhibitors–mediated disruption of Hsp90/p23 interactions in cell culture was determined by Hsp90h mutants that do not bind to Hsp90 inhibitors. 293T cells transiently
transfected with the indicated constructs for 24 h were treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-DZ7 for 12 h before analysis of RL activity as described in Fig. 1C . RL
activity was normalized for transfection efficiency and protein content and then to carrier control–treated cells. Points, mean; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05 relative to
NRL(WT)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL. B, coimmunoprecipitation of split RL reporters. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc
and treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 for 24 h. Interactions between NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc in the absence or presence of PU-H71 were
determined by immunoprecipitation using goat IgG control antibodies (left ) or goat polyclonal anti-myc antibodies (right ). The association with NRL(M185V)-p23 was
detected using an RL antibody. C, quantitation of expression of NRL(M185V)-p23 and Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc (B ) shows that the decrease in RL activity correlates
with decrease association between NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL. D, the expression of NRL(M185V)-p23, Hsp90h2.2-CRL-Myc, and Hsp70 in transfected
cells was determined by Western blotting using 1 of 10 of the cell lysates used for coimmunoprecipitation (IP ).

geldanamycin-based and purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitors in intact
cells in 96-well format, these stable cells were treated with different
concentrations of the inhibitors or carrier controls for 24 h. RL
activities were determined by optical bioluminescence imaging of
intact cells using a cooled CCD camera 1.5 h after addition of the
RL substrate EnduRen, followed by normalization of cell number by
sulforhodamine B cell proliferation assay (28).
The geldanamycin-based inhibitors (Fig. 4A and B) led to
similar inhibition of both NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90a-CRL and
NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h-CRL interactions, with a maximum
inhibition of 53% to 55%, 49% to 57%, and 60% to 61% observed
for geldanamycin, 17-AAG, and 17-DMAG, respectively, at 2 Amol/L.
In the purine-scaffold series, the ability of these seven compounds
to disrupt Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 interactions (Figs. 4C,
D and 5) correlated with their previously reported affinity for Hsp90
from tumor lysates (Fig. 1B; refs. 13, 17, 20, 24). Maximum inhibition
of 64% to 68% and 60% to 64% was observed at 1 Amol/L for both
PU-H71 and PU-DZ7, respectively (Fig. 4D). Overall, there was no
significant difference between the two Hsp90 isoforms (a and h)
in determining the sensitivity to both geldanamycin-based and
purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitors. There was no significant differences in the expression of MDR1 or the efflux of rhodamine
123 in PU-H71 or carrier control–treated 293T stable cells (data
not shown); thus, the decrease in complemented RL activity was
not due to up-regulation/activation of MDR1 that reduces
accumulation of coelenterazine (35).

www.aacrjournals.org

The purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 was more
effective in disruption of Hsp90A/p23 interactions in living
mice. Low micromolar concentrations of purine-scaffold Hsp90
inhibitors were previously reported to be achieved intratumorally
in s.c. xenografted mice after one administered dose of these
inhibitors (36). PU-H71 is a highly water-soluble inhibitor which
can be given to mice formulated in PBS (compared with that of
PU-DZ7); it was, therefore chosen to validate the mechanisms of
purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitors in living subjects. To determine
the efficacy of PU-H71 in disruption of Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/
p23 interactions in living mice, 293T cells stably transfected with
the Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 split RL reporters used in the
above cell culture studies (Figs. 4 and 5) were implanted in the
lower left and right flank of nude mice (n = 10), respectively, for
establishment of tumor xenografts. Bioluminescence imaging was
performed immediately after tail vein injection of the RL substrate
coelenterazine (30 Ag) using a cooled CCD camera as previously
described (21, 22, 24). After baseline scan, the mice were
randomized (n = 5 per group) and treated with 75 mg/kg of PUH71 or equal volume of carrier control (6.7% DMSO in PBS) i.p.
and reimaged at 6 and 14 h (Fig. 6A).
At 6 h post–PU-H71 administration, the average max photons
decreased by 4% and 11% for xenograft expressing NRL(M185V)p23/Hsp90a2.2-CRL and NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90h2.2-CRL compared with 36% and 18% increase in complemented RL activity in
carrier control–treated mice, respectively (P > 0.05 in both cases). At

Hsp90 inhibitors led to different levels of inhibition
of NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90-CRL complementation.

(Hsp90i ). 293T cells stably transfected with
NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90a2.2-CRL (left ) or
NRL(M185V)-p23/HSP90h2.2-CRL (right ) were
treated with geldanamycin (GA), 17-AAG, or 17-DMAG
for 24 h before determination of complemented RL
activity by bioluminescence imaging of intact cells.
B, complemented RL activities in cells treated with
Hsp90 inhibitors were normalized for cell number and

14 h, 56% and 32% decrease in maximum photons for xenograft
expressing NRL(M185V)-p23/Hsp90a2.2-CRL (P < 0.05 relative to
carrier control–treated mice at 0 h) and NRL(M185V)-p23/
Hsp90h2.2-CRL (P > 0.05 relative to carrier control–treated mice
at 0 h) was observed, compared with 23% increase and 4% decrease
in maximum photons in carrier control–treated mice, respectively
(Fig. 6B). Therefore, PU-H71 was more selective in inhibition of
Hsp90a/p23 interactions in living mice compared with that of
Hsp90h/p23.

scaffold Hsp90 inhibitors were first indirectly monitored in intact
cells in cell culture using genetically encoded SRL-PFAC reporters.
The efficacy of the lead compound (PU-H71) was subsequently
evaluated in living mice through repetitive, noninvasive imaging
and was found to be more selective for disruption of Hsp90a/p23
interactions compared with that of Hsp90h/p23 interactions.
Direct comparison of the efficacy of geldanamycin-based
and purine-based Hsp90 inhibitors in disruption of Hsp90A/
p23 and Hsp90B/p23 interactions. The efficacies of geldanamycin-based and purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitors in disruption of
Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 interactions were directly compared
using SRL-PFAC (Figs. 4 and 5). In agreement with their identical
Hsp90-binding moieties (16, 26, 27, 36), geldanamycin-based Hsp90
inhibitors led to similar maximal inhibition of RL activity relative
to carrier control–treated cells. On the other hand, purine-scaffold
Hsp90 inhibitors that differ in both their adenine moieties for
Hsp90 binding and aryl functional groups that alter conformation
of Hsp90 (Fig. 1B) led to different levels of inhibition in RL activity.
Their levels of inhibition of RL activity also positively correlated
with their affinity for Hsp90 from tumor cell lysates (Figs. 1B, 4C, D,
and 5). However, geldanamycin-based and purine-scaffold Hsp90
inhibitors tested were not isoform selective in their inhibition
of Hsp90a/p23 or Hsp90h/p23 interactions under cell culture
conditions. We have also extended our study using MCF-7 human
breast cancer cells stably expressing the Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/

Discussion
The up-regulation of the Hsp90 chaperone system is thought
to allow cancer cells to sustain expression of client proteins that
are overexpressed or mutated in cancer (6, 37, 38). Different classes
of small molecule inhibitors have been developed to inhibit Hsp90
(a and h), but the mechanisms by which these inhibitors disrupt
Hsp90/p23 interactions, as well as the role of each Hsp90 isoform
(a and h) in determining sensitivity to these inhibitors, have not
been noninvasively and longitudinally examined in living subjects.
Because both Hsp90a and Hsp90h are expressed in cancer cells and
their expression was compensatory (38), the individual role(s) of
Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 in determining sensitivity and selectivity to Hsp90 inhibitors cannot be easily deciphered.
In the current study, the nature of Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23
interactions and the efficacy of geldanamycin-based and purine-

much better because each mouse serves as its own control. We
have also obtained preliminary data on comparing the efficacy of
17-AAG and PU-H71 in disruption of Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23
interactions in living mice. At the same concentration (75 mg/kg)
and route of injection (i.p.), PU-H71 was more effective in
disruption of split Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 reporter interactions compared with that of 17-AAG.7
Comparison of SRL-PFAC with other strategies for monitoring
protein-protein interactions in living subjects. To our knowledge,
this is the first demonstration of indirect monitoring of isoformspecific Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 interactions and evaluation
of the efficacy of different classes of Hsp90 inhibitors in cell culture
conditions. The same genetically encoded reporter system was
then used to validate the lead compound from the cell culture
screen (PU-H71) for its ability to disrupt Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/
p23 interactions in living mice. In addition to SRL-PFAC, split FL
protein fragment–assisted complementation assays (SFL-PFAC)
have also been used to monitor other protein-protein interactions
in living mice (40–42). The smaller fragment sizes for the split RL
strategy (23 kDa for NRL and 13 kDa for CRL) relative to split FL
fragments (f32 kDa) may minimize steric hindrance for Hsp90a/
p23 and Hsp90h/p23 interactions in the split reporters. Because FL
requires ATP for its enzymatic activity (43), SFL-PFAC may not be
suitable for evaluating the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors (and other

p23 split reporters. Both PU-H71 and 17-DMAG led to dosedependent decreases in complemented RL activities in cell culture
studies, as in the case for 293T cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Selectivity of PU-H71 in disruption of Hsp90A/p23 interactions in living mice. The mechanism and kinetics of PU-H71 in
disruption of Hsp90a/p23 and Hsp90h/p23 interactions in living
mice was further validated in living mice by noninvasive, repetitive
imaging of 293T tumor xenografts expressing the Hsp90a/p23 and
Hsp90h/p23 split reporters. Under cell culture conditions, PU-H71
was equally effective in disruption of both Hsp90a/p23 and
Hsp90h/p23 interactions (Figs. 4B,C and 5). In living mice, however,
PU-H71 was more effective in disruption of Hsp90a/p23 interactions compared with that of Hsp90h/p23 interactions (Fig. 6B).
The data suggest the nature of Hsp90h/p23 interactions was
stronger than that of Hsp90a/p23 under the influence of tumor
microenvironment. Thus, development of isoform-selective Hsp90
inhibitors is very important in cancer treatment because Hsp90a
and Hsp90h play distinct roles in determination of drug responses
and resistance (39). In addition to validating the mechanism of
Hsp90 inhibitors in intact cells in cell culture studies, the efficacy of
Hsp90 inhibitors in living mice should also be monitored because
(a) the immediate effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on disruption of
Hsp90/p23 interactions can be indirectly monitored, (b) pharmacokinetics and delivery in living mice can be directly optimized, (c)
repeated monitoring of efficacy can be accomplished with
