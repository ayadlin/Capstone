Estimations of the Increasing Prevalence and
Plateau Prevalence of Chronic Myeloid
Leukemia in the Era of Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitor Therapy
Xuelin Huang, PhD1; Jorge Cortes, MD2; and Hagop Kantarjian, MD2

BACKGROUND: The annual incidence of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the United States is approximately 4800
cases. With the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, the all-cause annual mortality rate was reduced to 2%.
Therefore, the prevalence of CML is increasing over time. Estimating the CML prevalence and plateau prevalence is
important in the implementation of health care strategies and future therapeutic trials. The objective of this report was to
estimate the increasing prevalence and plateau prevalence of CML in future years. METHODS: The prevalence of CML
was estimated based on several parameters: the annual mortality rate on TKI therapy compared with a age-matched,
normal population; the incidence of CML; the anticipated population growth in the United States; and aging of the
population. RESULTS: On the basis of these calculations, the mortality ratio of patients with CML compared with an
age-matched normal population was approximately 1.53. The estimated prevalence of CML is approximately 70,000
in 2010, 112,000 in 2020, 144,000 in 2030, 167,000 in 2040, and 181,000 in 2050, when it will reach a near plateau
prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the prevalence of CML will continue to increase to
reach a near plateau prevalence 35 times the annual incidence. These estimates should be considered in health care

INTRODUCTION
The annual incidence of newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the United States is estimated at approximately 1.0 to 1.3 per 100,000 population or approximately 4800 to 5200 new cases.1 Before the advent of therapy with
imatinib mesylate, a selective breakpoint cluster region/v-abl Abelson murine leukemia virus (Bcr-Abl) tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI), and second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib), the median survival of patients with CML was
approximately 6 years.2,3 Therefore, the estimated prevalence of cases of CML in the United States was approximately
25,000 to 30,000. The success of imatinib therapy has changed the demographics of CML drastically. Although the
annual incidence remains essentially unchanged, the estimated annual mortality, which was approximately 10% for the first
2 years and 20% to 25% in subsequent years, has now been reduced to an estimated all-cause mortality of 2% annually for
the first 10 years of follow-up.4-7 Because of this very favorable therapeutic outcome, the prevalence of CML has started to
increase annually. On the basis of average estimates, it has been suggested that the plateau prevalence of CML may be reached
in the year 2040 with a plateau prevalence (ie, when incidence and mortality balance each other and no further significant
accumulation of CML cases is expected) of 150,000 to 250,000 cases.6,7 However, there has been no formal analysis of the
rate of increase in prevalence and the plateau prevalence of CML. This is the purpose of the current analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To calculate the increased prevalence of CML, the time periods associated with the estimated prevalence, and the plateau
prevalence, we considered the following factors, as reported in the literature: 1) the annual mortality rate of patients with

CML who received treatment with imatinib, 2) the incidence of CML, 3) the anticipated population growth in
the United States, and 4) the aging of the population in
the United States.
The annual all-cause mortality rate of patients with
CML who receive imatinib is approximately 1% to 2% in
the first 8 to 10 years of follow-up.4-7 This estimate is
based on a patient population with a median age of 40 to
50 years. However, as patients age, it is anticipated that
the all-cause mortality rate will increase. Because the follow-up with imatinib is only 10 years for patients with
CML who receive it, an extrapolation is necessary for the
prediction of survival beyond 10 years. Therefore, we
compared the mortality rates of 415 patients with newly
diagnosed CML who were referred to our institution
from 2001 to 2010 with the mortality rates of a general
population who had the same age distribution. A Cox
proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard (or mortality) ratio between these 2 populations.8 The
calculated mortality ratio of CML patients (in their first
10 years after the diagnosis of CML) versus the general
population with the same age distribution was 1.53.
Then, we assumed that this trend would remain the same
for the rest of the lifetimes of these 2 populations. On the
basis of mortality rates for a general population by age
group,1 extrapolation of the mortality rates for patients
with CML for all the years after diagnosis was computed.
We calculated that the prevalence of CML in 2000 would

3124

be approximately 25,000 cases. In total, 4870 new cases of
Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML are diagnosed
every year before considering the population growth.9
Less than 5% of patients will present in a transformed
phase; these patients have a short median survival regardless of whether they receive TKI therapy. Therefore, the
estimated annual incidence of newly diagnosed CML in
chronic phase is approximately 4700.
For the growth of the United States population, the
US Census Bureau published 3 predictions (lowest, middle, and highest). We have used the middle projection,
which predicts 392 million individuals in the year 2050, a
rough growth of 40% over the estimated number of 281
million at the year 2000.10 The median age of the population will increase by 5 years. This translates approximately
into a 10% increase in the incidence of CML.

RESULTS
Without considering population growth and the effect of
aging, but including the effect of the CML-versus-normal
population mortality ratio of 1.53, the estimated plateau
prevalence of CML was calculated as 105,000 cases and
would be reached by 2035. A previous assumption of a
constant 2% annual mortality for the whole remaining
lifetime of patients with CML would have projected a plateau prevalence of CML of approximately 240,000 cases,
but this would be reached after 2110. However, this
assumption would be incorrect. Under this assumption,

the long-term survival of a patient with CML, in time,
would become longer than that of a normal aging individual whose annual mortality obviously would exceed 2% in
later years. Instead, we estimated that the mortality rate
ratio between the CML study group versus the general
population would be 1.53 in a Cox proportional hazards
model.8 Assuming the trend will continue for the lifetimes
of these 2 populations, with such calculation, the median
remaining lifetime for a patient with newly diagnosed
CML would be approximately 22 years. Combining these
considerations, our projection of the future prevalence of
CML in time is illustrated in Figure 1.
On the basis of the analysis, the projected number of
patients with CML is roughly 70,000 in 2010, 112,000 in
2020, 144,000 in 2030, 167,000 in 2040, and 181,000 in
2050, when it reaches a close-to-plateau prevalence. For
extrapolation purposes, the plateau prevalence of CML in
other countries is approximately 35 to 40 times the incidence of CML for the particular country if similar
assumptions can be made.

DISCUSSION
In cancer, the suggested definition of cure is the clinical
elimination of disease for a long period (usually >5-10
years) after the completion of therapy. In other words, it is
a disease-free status offering the patient a life expectancy
similar to that of the normal population. In most cancers,
therapy is completed within a short period (eg, <6-12
months with rare exceptions like, acute lymphocytic leukemia). Few cancers have an indolent course requiring no
interventions or treatment with therapies at reasonable
costs. These include indolent lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytopenia, and others. CML is unique in combining the
need for an expensive, long-term therapy (daily TKIs)
that results in clinical elimination of the disease only with
continued therapy in most patients. Thus, patients with
CML resemble patients with benign conditions (rather
than patients with cancer), such as diabetes, hypertension,
or coronary heart disease, for whom continuous, effective
therapy results in a functional cure rather than a molecular
cure. This increases dramatically the prevalence of CML,
which, in the current analysis, is estimated to plateau at
approximately 35 times its incidence by 2050: approximately 180,000 cases in the United States.
The estimation of the increasing prevalence and of
the plateau prevalence of CML is important for economic
considerations and for the design of future trials. The estiCancer

mated cost of imatinib today is approximately $54,000
annually, whereas the cost of second-generation TKIs is
approximately $80,000 to $90,000. If second-generation

3125

Original Article

TKIs replace imatinib as frontline therapy, and if TKI
therapy is considered a lifetime necessary treatment for
most patients, then, depending on the year of analysis, the
cost of care for patients with CML can be prohibitive in
most emerging countries and even in more developed
countries. For example, once the prevalence of CML
reaches 100,000 cases, the cost of frontline, second-generation TKI therapy will be approximately $8 billion in the
United States. However, imatinib will become generic after the year 2014. The cost of generic imatinib is
unknown but may range from $2000 to $10,000 per year.
If generic imatinib remains frontline CML therapy, then
the same estimations will result in a range of cost of care of
CML annually of $180 million to $1 billion, a more
acceptable burden on health care programs. Whether
imatinib or second-generation TKIs are established as
frontline therapy will depend on the 5-year to 10-year follow-up of the ongoing randomized ‘‘Evaluating Nilotinib
Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed
Patients’’ (ENESTnd) and ‘‘Dasatinib Versus Imatinib in
Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase CML’’
(DASISION) trials, which are comparing nilotinib and
dasatinib with imatinib,11,12 and the possible emergence
of other drugs that also may be used as initial therapy. If
the 5-year to 10-year follow-up data indicate significant
differences in overall survival (perhaps >5%-10%), progression-free survival, and event-free survival (perhaps
>10%-15%), then using second-generation TKIs as
frontline therapy may be justifiable in terms of the lifeyears saved and the accompanying productivity, despite
the differences in cost of care. Such decisions may depend
on the perceptions of the differences in benefit versus
differences in cost of care, as judged by health authorities
in various countries and by physicians and patients. For
estimation purposes, Figure 2 illustrates longer term outcomes with imatinib and second-generation TKI from
our historic institutional data with the current follow-up.
The increasing prevalence of CML also highlights the
need for strategies to eradicate CML and to produce molecular cures (allowing discontinuation of therapy) as opposed
to functional cures (maintenance of close to normal lifespan with continuation of TKI therapy). Currently, from
10% to 30% of patients achieve a status of undetectable
molecular disease (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio, <4.5 log) for >2
years. Among such patients, discontinuation of imatinib
therapy produces a molecular relapse rate of approximately
60%, mostly in the first year after discontinuation, and a
40% maintenance of absence of molecular disease.13 Thus
with current strategies, <5-10% of patients may be able to

3126

discontinue imatinib therapy. This figure may increase
with the use of second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy. This highlights the need to develop additional investigational strategies, potentially implemented at the time of
minimal molecular disease, to increase the proportion of
patients with durable undetectable molecular disease. Such
strategies may include old agents, like pegylated interferon,
omacetaxine, decitabine, or others, or newer targeted therapies, such as hedgehog inhibitors, JAKz inhibitors, or
others, that also may eradicate dormant CML stem cells.
On the basis of an incidence of 1 case per 100,000
population in the west, the current study estimates that
the prevalence of CML will plateau at 35 times the incidence.14 However, this may not apply to all countries and
will depend on whether there are known variations in the
incidence of CML in particular geographic areas and on
the presentation and course of CML in different regions.
For example, the incidence of CML in India ranges from
0.8 to 2.2 cases per 100,000 population, similar to Western studies. However, other studies from India also report
sometimes a higher frequency of CML among leukemias,
40% to 80% compared with 25% in the United States.
Patients from India with CML also are younger (median
age range, 35-40 years vs 50-60 years in western countries).15 Some studies have also reported a worse prognosis
for patients with CML in India in the preimatinib era,
which may be attributed to delayed diagnosis and a higher
proportion of patients with high-risk, chronic-phase
CML or with advanced phases of CML at presentation.
Thus, the extrapolation of the prevalence of CML from
this study to other nations or geographic areas, and the
potential financial implications, have to be reinterpreted
in the context of such differences in incidence, disease
aggressiveness at presentation, response to modern therapy, and annual mortality with new TKI therapy.
