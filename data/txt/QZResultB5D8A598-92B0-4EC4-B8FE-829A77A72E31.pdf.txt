BACKGROUND: Symptomatic burden from constitutional symptoms, anemia, and splenomegaly-related symptoms
are common and morbidity inducing in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). The authors previously developed a MFspecific instrument for capturing the burden of MF-associated disease-related symptoms, the Myelofibrosis Symptom
Assessment Form. METHODS: The authors evaluated the usefulness of serial administration of the Myelofibrosis
Symptom Assessment Form as an instrument for the assessment of symptomatic burden and improvement in
conjunction with the therapeutic clinical trial of the open label phase 2 trial of the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor
INCB018424 in patients with MF. RESULTS: The analysis cohort of 87 patients treated in this trial demonstrated
that the instrument was comprehensive and sensitive to symptoms present at trial enrollment. In addition, baseline
Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form symptom scores correlated well with objective parameters such as splenomegaly and impaired performance status assessed by the 6-minute walk test. Serial administration while on therapy
with INCB018424 demonstrated the instrument to be sensitive to symptomatic change, and that improvements
in symptoms correlated well with objective improvements in both weight loss and performance status (6-minute
walk test). CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form in this phase 2 trial helped
characterize the symptomatic improvements observed with use of INCB018424 in MF patients. In an era of many
targeted therapies undergoing testing for MF with potential symptomatic benefit, the Myelofibrosis Symptom
Assessment Form may provide a useful tool for objective symptomatic assessment and potentially allow some nonC 2011 American Cancer Society.

symptoms.

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that is characterized by a series of consequences from the clonal disease.1 Included among the consequences of MF are the development of ineffective hematopoiesis (and thus potentially anemia and other cytopenias), leukoerythroblastosis, splenomegaly through perhaps a variety of mechanisms
including (but not limited to) ineffective hematopoiesis and splenic sequestration of immature myeloid cells, significant
constitutional symptoms (night sweats, fevers, weight loss), pruritus, risk of blastic transformation, and premature death.2
We have previously demonstrated that the symptomatic burden among patients with MF is significant both from directly
observable effects of disease (ie, from anemia and/or splenomegaly) and by self-reported outcomes from MF patients for

less quantifiable symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats,
and pruritus.3 We have also reported that the prevalence
of these symptoms is relatively uniform across the 3 main
subtypes of MF (namely, primary MF, post‥polycythemia vera MF [post-PV MF], and post‥essential thrombocythemia MF [post-ET MF]).4 In addition, the presence
of significant constitutional symptoms is not only bothersome for the individual patient, but has been found to be
prognostically detrimental and is included as an adverse
prognostic factor in the International Working Group for
Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment prognostic score
for MF.5
Historically, therapies for MF have been largely
palliative, with very limited ability to significantly impact
the symptomatic burden of patients afflicted with the
disease. However, the discovery of the JAK2-V617F
mutation in 20056 (and subsequent discovery of related
myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated mutations7,8) has
ushered in an era of targeted therapeutic approaches for
MF including JAK inhibitors,9 which down-modulate
the dysregulated activity of JAKs that is characteristic in
the myeloproliferative neoplasms. Initial results of these
targeted trials demonstrated a profound ability of these
medications to decrease MF-associated splenomegaly and
symptoms.10,11 The difficulty was that no current instrument of patient-reported outcomes adequately and concisely assessed the spectrum of MF-associated symptoms.
Therefore, we developed, and validated in a single time
point validation study, the Myelofibrosis Symptom
Assessment Form.4 This instrument captured the spectrum of MF-associated constitutional symptoms (fatigue,
night sweats, fevers, pruritus, weight loss) and splenomegaly-associated symptoms (abdominal pain, early satiety, mechanical effects from the spleen). This prior
validation of the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment
Form used a series of established instruments of patientreported outcomes to validate the questions and results
obtained from the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment
Form. In addition, a separate question is asked relating
to an overall assessment of quality of life.
We sought to evaluate the use of the Myelofibrosis
Symptom Assessment Form for measurement of baseline
symptoms and sensitivity to detect changes when used
serially in clinical trials. Therefore, we used the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form in serial administrations
in conjunction with the largest phase 2 trial ever
conducted for that disorder, the open label phase 2 trial of
the selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor INCB018424
(Trial 251).10

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
MF patients eligible for the INCB018424-251 trial10
(both primary MF and post-PV/post-ET MF) were
required to have adequate organ function, to have sufficient hematopoietic reserves (ie, platelet count >100 
109/L, absolute neutrophil count >1.0  109/L), and to
require therapy. Therapy was administered as an open
label phase 2 trial of INCB018424, where all patients
received the investigational agent, although a range of
doses was used based on the ability to tolerate the main
dose-limiting toxicity of the agent, which is thrombocytopenia. Patients enrolled in the therapeutic trial completed
the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form at screening, after 2 weeks on therapy, at the completion of cycles
1, 2, and 3, and then every 3 cycles (28-day cycles). The
instrument was used after the initiation of the trial so these
results are sequential but represent only approximately the
latter half of patients enrolled in the trial (n ¼ 87).
Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form
The Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form used in
this trial was slightly modified from our prior publication.4 Specifically for ease of administration, fatigue was
measured in a single item in which patients graded their
fatigue on a simple 0 to 10 scale, where a score of 0 indicates absence of the symptom, and a score of 10 indicates
the symptom with worst imaginable severity. Additional
items were included exactly as we have analyzed previously. Please see Table 1 for a summary of Myelofibrosis
Symptom Assessment Form as administered in the context of this trial.
Exploratory Questions
Additional exploratory questions were asked in addition
to the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form, based
on the prevalence of certain symptoms and complaints
reported anecdotally among the first half of the MF
patients enrolled on the therapeutic clinical trial. Specifically included were single line item questions on insomnia, ability to bend, altered self-image, swelling, and
altered bowel or bladder habits (see Table 1).
Comparison Measurements
Where possible, objective measurements were made in
conjunction with the therapeutic trial to allow for further
evaluation of the sensitivity of the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form to assess change in clinical variables. Those variables amenable to such measurements

included serial objective weights, spleen size, and the presence of anemia. In addition, the 6-minute walk test was
used for assessment of overall ability to ambulate and was
performed in standard fashion reported in cardiovascular
and pulmonary disease-related trials (American Thoracic
Society: observed laps of a 30-35 m course, indoors, level,
without encouragement). The 6-minute walk test was performed twice at baseline (before first dose of therapy), and
then after 1, 3, and 6 28-day cycles of therapy.
Analysis

study to see their consistency in change over the duration
of the trial. All 87 subjects who completed the Myelofib-

rosis Symptom Assessment Form were included in the initial analysis of change in symptom score from baseline.
On the basis of initial responses and incidence of thrombocytopenia, doses of 10 mg twice daily to 25 mg twice
daily were found to be most effective.10 Baseline symptom
scores for subjects with doses of 10 mg twice daily to 25
mg twice daily (n ¼ 66) were then further assessed for
associations and correlations with baseline parameters
that might impact MF-associated symptoms (anemia,
degree of splenomegaly, and ability to ambulate as measured by the 6-minute walk test) (Table 2). Subsequently,
changes in each Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment
Form parameter were correlated with the responses at 3
and 6 months to other objective measurements of
response, including change in weight, decrease in spleen

seen on the trial that might impact symptoms, specifically,
worsening of anemia while on the trial.

RESULTS
Patients and Baseline Myelofibrosis Symptom
Assessment Form Responses
Complete therapeutic results of the 153 patients enrolled
in the INCB018424-251 trial are reported separately.10
The final 87 MF patients enrolled in that trial who had 2
or more Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form instruments completed are included in this analysis.
Included patients were of a median age (65 years),
sex distribution (35 % women), and disease subtype (53%
primary MF) typical for a clinical trial in MF. Baseline
assessment at trial enrollment demonstrated that among
the patients enrolled in this clinical trial, each of the 15
items assessed in the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment
Form was present in >50% of patients except for fever
(46%), cough (45%), altered bowel movements (48%),
and pruritus (45%) (Table 3). The most common symptoms were fatigue, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, and
altered quality of life, all with median scores of 4.0 (of the
10-point scale) with 91% having some degree of fatigue

4872

(score 1). Ninety-five percent of patients had at least 2
symptoms present on the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form.

Comparison of Baseline Myelofibrosis
Symptom Assessment Form Responses to
Baseline Disease Features
A direct comparison of patient baseline disease features,
including splenomegaly, anemia, body mass index (BMI),
age, and 6-minute walk test performance, with individual
Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form items was performed. We found the clearest statistical correlations
between baseline splenomegaly and Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form responses (Table 4). We found
massive splenomegaly (>20 cm below costal margin) to
be positively associated with worse fatigue item scores
(P ¼ .01), decreased ability to walk around and exercise
(P ¼ .0001), decreased ability to bend (P ¼ .03), hindrance to perform daily activities (P ¼ .004), and a worse
quality of life (P ¼ .01). Consistent with our prior observations, the degree of anemia did not correlate with worsening fatigue scores (possibly because anemia was so
common among enrolled patients). Neither the age of
subjects nor baseline weight (by BMI) were associated
with differences in baseline symptoms. Assessments of the
6-minute walk test results measured at baseline showed

Therapy with INCB018424 resulted in rapid reduction in MF-associated symptoms, with 46% to 85% of
patients experiencing improvement in each individual
item assessed by the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment
Form. The greatest improvements in Myelofibrosis
Symptom Assessment Form score improvements were
reported by patients experiencing abdominal discomfort,
night sweats, pruritus, altered body image, and fever (see
Table 3 and Fig. 1) and corresponded to improvements in
the individual MF symptom scales as well as the patients’
overall assessment of quality of life. A net improvement
was noted over time in all symptoms except bone pain.
Median improvement in individual symptom scores
ranged from 1 to 2 points, given baseline severity scores of
2 to 4 across most symptoms, these changes were both
valid and consistent. Although anemia was a toxicity
encountered with INCB018424 therapy, we did not see a
significant correlation between either developing anemia
or the degree of anemia on the symptomatic improvements seen and recorded by the Myelofibrosis Symptom
Assessment Form (Table 4).

Figure 2. Median change is shown in 4 splenomegaly-associated symptoms (abdominal discomfort/pain, ability to move/walk
around, ability to bend/tie shoes, changed appetite) based on the level of spleen response after 6 cycles of therapy (ie, full, International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment [IWG-MRT] 50% reduction; partial, some splenic reduction but
less than IWG-MRT threshold; and no response). Subjects with palpable baseline spleen and on-study responses after 6 cycles
and who initiated therapy at doses of 10 mg twice daily, 15 mg twice daily, or 25 mg twice daily are included (n ¼ 58).

Serial Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment
Form Changes in Response to Splenomegaly
and Other Responses
Of subjects who initiated dosing at 10 mg twice daily, 15
mg twice daily, or 25 mg twice daily, 77.6% achieved at
least a 25% reduction in palpable spleen length after 6
cycles of therapy. Patients with reduction in spleen size
were collated into 3 groups according to the response after
6 cycles of therapy (approximately 6 months); full responders were defined as subjects having achieved 35%
reduction in spleen volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 50% measured by palpable
spleen length (an International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment defined response12),
moderate responders were defined as subjects having
achieved 25% to 49% reduction in palpable spleen length
or 15% to 34% reduction in MRI-measured spleen volume, and nonresponders were subjects who did not meet
the criteria for full or partial response. Graphical comparison shows that the relative improvements in Myelofibrosis
Symptom Assessment Form responses for improvement
in abdominal discomfort/pain, ability to move around,
and appetite were associated with the level of spleen
response (Fig. 2). Interestingly, all subjects reported

4874

improvement in ability to bend down/tie shoes, regardless
of spleen reduction response. General fatigue improvement also tracked with spleen response, with mean
changes in Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form fatigue score of 1.6, 0.77, and 0.2 for the full, moderate, and nonresponder groups, respectively. However,
these associations did not reach the level of statistical correlations, most likely because of the small size of the analysis groups (Table 4).
Weight loss resulting from poor appetite and illness
contributes to the MF symptom burden. Subjects receiving INCB018424 therapy gained weight.10 The degree of
weight gain was statistically significantly correlated with
improvement in Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment
Form-based assessments of early satiety and abdominal
pain. Interestingly, weight gain was also statistically significantly correlated with improvements in cough, bone
pain, and recurrent fevers.

score on the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form
compared with subjects who improved 6-minute walk test
performance by <50 m. In addition, improvements in
6-minute walk test were statistically significantly correlated with improvements in abdominal pain, discomfort,
and quality of life scores (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
We report the first successful serial use of a MF-specific
instrument for measuring baseline symptoms, and subsequent change, in the context of a therapeutic clinical
trial. The process of validation of an instrument of
patient-reported outcomes is never complete, and further validation of the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form will occur in the setting of randomized
placebo-controlled trials (ongoing). The need for such
an instrument for MF is that current instruments assessing patient-reported outcomes for cancer trials do not
adequately address the needs of patients with MF or
myeloproliferative neoplasms as a whole. Broadly used
instruments for patients with malignant disease operate
on 2 different paradigms. The first is that patients will
be diagnosed with a malignancy (ie, breast cancer),
receive therapy (ie, surgery  adjuvant radiotherapy or
chemotherapy), and then be cured. The second paradigm is for the patient with metastatic disease, in which
death is likely inevitable, with therapy hopefully
prolonging survival. The spectrum of symptoms in
currently used instruments deal with symptoms likely to
arise in these circumstances (ie, anemia, fatigue, and
pain from disease, nausea from therapy or disease, hormonal changes from therapy). No current general
instrument of measuring symptoms in cancer patients
(ie, Memorial Symptom Assessment Score,13 The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Symptom Assessment Score14 or European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C3015) incorporates all the key aspects of symptoms an MF patient
experiences in a solitary instrument (specifically, fatigue,
splenomegaly-related symptoms, bone pain, night
sweats, pruritus, and cough). Given this latter finding,
no large MF clinical trial has previously incorporated
any of these traditional cancer instruments into their
assessments of enrolled patients.
The baseline values obtained in this trial further
validate our previous observations that the Myelofibrosis
Symptom Assessment Form is easy to administer,4 and
that symptoms that were assessed were quite prevalent,
Cancer

with the symptoms present in >50% of patients in 11
of 15 items assessed. In addition, the severity of the
symptoms at baseline corresponded well with the symptomatic burden expected in the cohort of advanced MF
patients who were eligible for this trial. Correlations
between expected burden of certain symptoms and their
objective benchmarks (ie, the degree of splenomegaly)
further validate the sensitivity of the instrument in
assessing symptom burden. The exploratory items also
were quite common, such as insomnia, and further
added to the utility of the information provided by the
instrument.
A key component to validation of an instrument
for use in clinical trials is whether it is able to detect a
change in symptoms in response to therapy. We note
that not only was a change in individual symptoms identified by the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form,
but the changes over time were consistent and stable. In
addition, even with relatively small numbers of patients
we were able to correlate levels of symptomatic response
with objective markers of response such as improvements in weight loss, reduction in splenomegaly, and
improvements in performance status as grossly assessed
by 6-minute walk test. Although we saw trends for
detection of certain symptomatic responses and the
degree of splenic reduction, these were not statistically
significant.
None of the objective response parameters
assessed (6-minute walk test, spleen size, body weight)
showed associations or statistically significant correlations with symptoms such as pruritus or night sweats.
Although a mechanism for this lack of correlation is
unproven, it is likely that improvement in many MF
symptoms is multifactorial, and thus symptomatic benefit is not tied solely to the degree of splenic reduction.
Indeed, we have recently reported the elevation in several inflammatory cytokines in MF patients compared
with healthy volunteer controls.10 More importantly,
the decrease in cytokine levels (interleukin-1ra, interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1b, tumor
necrosis factor-a, and C-reactive protein) was associated
with improvements in a composite symptom score
comprised of the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment
Form elements night sweats, pruritus, abdominal pain/
discomfort, and bone/muscle pain for subjects
who were treated with the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor,
INCB018424. However, in the end we must emphasize
that the mechanism of symptomatic improvement in
patients with MF, either with INCB18424 or with

other JAK2 inhibitors, remains without a definitive
explanation or mechanism.
The therapy of MF has entered an era of rapid
change, with multiple lines of therapies in clinical development. Although in the past we have seen palliative
benefit with agents for improving anemia (such as thalidomide16 [alone or in combination17] or androgens18),
splenomegaly (splenectomy, splenic radiotherapy,
hydroxyurea, or cladribine),19 or both (lenalidomide),
none has ever had a significant impact on symptoms.
Even if these agents had impacted symptoms, no MF
instruments were available to assess these changes. The
current era has multiple lines of therapeutic investigations, including JAK inhibitors in addition to
INCB018424 (SB151820 and TG10134811 among
others), histone deacetylase inhibitors (LBH589),21
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (RAD001),22
and even more potent and better tolerated immunomodulatory drugs (pomalidomide).23 Pilot data on
most of these mechanistic approaches suggest that there
will be differential impact on MF symptoms associated
with splenomegaly, anemia, and disease features such as
pruritus and night sweats. Individual assessment of each
of these agents on baseline MF symptoms, and some
comparison of the agents by serial measurement of
impact on MF symptoms (assessed by Myelofibrosis
Symptom Assessment Form) may now be possible.
Future development and validation of instruments
applicable across the spectrum of myeloproliferative
neoplasms, as well as availability in multiple languages,
are planned.
