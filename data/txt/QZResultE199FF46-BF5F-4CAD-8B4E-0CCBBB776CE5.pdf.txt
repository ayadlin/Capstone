Abstract
The major heat shock protein Hsp72 is constitutively expressed
in many tumor cell lines and biopsies, and its expression
correlates with poor prognosis in several types of cancer.
Hsp72 was suggested to play an important role in neoplastic
transformation and tumor development. We addressed the role
of Hsp72 in cancer cells by investigating the consequences of
specific depletion of Hsp72 using small interfering RNA. Downregulation of Hsp72 in certain cancer lines triggered cell
senescence associated with activation and stabilization of p53
and induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Effects of Hsp72
depletion on senescence and p53 did not result from a
proteotoxic stress, DNA instability, or activation of ataxiatelangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related
pathways. Instead, depletion of Hsp72 reduced stability and
activity of the p53 inhibitor Hdm2. In addition, Hsp72
depletion triggered a p53-independent senescence program
through inhibitory phosphorylation and down-regulation of
the cell cycle kinase Cdc2. Therefore, Hsp72 provides a
selective advantage to cancer cells by suppressing default
senescence via p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways.

Introduction
The major heat shock protein Hsp72 plays a critical role in
survival of cells under stressful conditions. As a molecular
chaperone, Hsp72 prevents aggregation of stress-damaged proteins
and assists in refolding of denatured polypeptides (1). Interestingly,
Hsp72 can protect cells even from stresses that do not cause
protein damage, including certain anticancer drugs, tumor necrosis
factor (TNF), UV irradiation, and others. Such a protection is
associated with a strong antiapoptotic effect of Hsp72 (2, 3), which
involves direct inhibition of the apoptotic signaling, such as
suppression of proapoptotic c-Jun-NH2-kinase pathway (4, 5).
A body of literature indicates that normal tissues usually
express a constitutive member of the Hsp70 family, Hsc73, but
not Hsp72, which is induced only under stressful conditions that
cause protein damage. In contrast, tumors often constitutively
express both Hsc73 and Hsp72 at high levels (see refs. 6–8 for
review). Furthermore, high expression of Hsp72 in human tumors
correlates with high invasiveness, metastasis, resistance to
chemotherapy, and poor prognosis of the disease (see ref. 9 for
review). For example, in colorectal and lung cancers, levels of Hsp72

expression closely correlate with advanced clinical stages and
positive lymph node involvement (10, 11). These findings suggest
that Hsp72 provides a selective advantage to tumor cells during
cancer progression.
A possible association of Hsp72 with cancer development was
shown in several works where overproduction of recombinant
Hsp72 in various systems promoted cancerous properties of cells.
Accordingly, overproduction of Hsp72 in fibrosarcoma cells
significantly enhanced their tumorigenic potential in athymic
mice (12), whereas transgenic mice that expressed human Hsp72
at high levels developed multiple lymphomas (13). Moreover,
expression of Hsp72 in Rat-1 fibroblasts led to formation of foci,
anchorage-independent growth, and development of tumors in
nude mice (14). It is believed that the antiapoptotic activity of
Hsp72 plays an important role in cancer development. For
example, Hsp72 may allow cancer cells to withstand apoptosis
caused by stressful factors of the tumor microenvironment, such as
hypoxia, starvation (15), TNF (16), or FAS (17). Apparently, in line
with this suggestion, it was shown that depletion of Hsp72 by
adenovirus-encoded Hsp72 antisense RNA causes rapid death of
various types of tumor cells, whereas nontransformed cells remain
resistant to such treatment (18, 19). However, most of these effects
were probably caused by a subtle toxicity of adenoviruses used in
these experiments, which, in combination with Hsp72 depletion,
led to massive caspase-independent death of cancer cells
associated with activation of cathepsin B (20). Accordingly, we
have shown that although apoptosis of prostate carcinoma cells
PC-3 or DU-145 can be seen after infection with adenoviruses
expressing Hsp72 antisense RNA, no such apoptosis was observed
when the Hsp72 depletion was achieved by delivery of this same
antisense RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA) via nontoxic
retroviruses (21). Therefore, high expression levels of Hsp72 in
certain cancer cell lines seem to be unrelated to protection from
internal proapoptotic signals.
Besides apoptosis, cell proliferation could be limited by
senescence. Cancer cells, although able to divide indefinitely, can
nevertheless undergo senescence upon exposure to certain
anticancer drugs and radiation therapy (22). In fact, it seems that
activation of the senescence program and consequent permanent
growth arrest significantly contributes to the loss of the clonogenic
capacity of tumor cells and probably to tumor regression after
anticancer therapy (23).
Interestingly, it was recently reported that depletion of Hsp70-2,
a minor member of the Hsp70 family that is critical for testes
development, led to growth arrest and senescence of tumor cells,
which was associated with induction of the Cdk inhibitory protein
p21 (24). Therefore, it seems that Hsp70-2 may play an important
role in supporting normal growth of cancer cells. It is not clear,
however, how this protein is related to cancer development
because no association of Hsp70-2 expression with tumor
properties has been reported thus far.

Cancer Research

Here, to address a role of the major heat shock protein, Hsp72, in
cancer cells, we used retroviral vectors to deliver siRNAs that target
Hsp72 in a range of cancer cell lines. It seems that Hsp72 depletion
by this method led to activation of the p53 pathway and cell
senescence. We further investigated the mechanisms of activation
of the p53 pathway upon Hsp72 depletion and the pathway that is
involved in senescence of p53 knockout cells under similar
conditions.

Results
Depletion of Hsp72 in cancer cells activates senescence
program. Many cancer lines and tumor biopsies show high
constitutive levels of Hsp72, suggesting that up-regulation of Hsp72
gives selective advantages to cancer cells. To elucidate a role of
permanent expression of Hsp72 in cancer cells, we investigated
physiologic effects of depletion of this heat shock protein from
HCT116 colon carcinoma cells using the siRNA approach. We
constructed three retroviruses that express siRNA targeted to
different regions of the Hsp72 coding region. HCT116 cells infected
with these viruses and selected for 2 days with puromycin were
analyzed for the expression of Hsp72 as well as other heat shock
proteins. As a control, we used cells infected with retrovirus that
does not express siRNA or retrovirus that express unrelated siRNA.
With si2 construct, an abrupt and dramatic (i.e., up to 95%) drop of
Hsp72 levels was observed on days 5 to 6 postinfection (Fig. 1).
A less dramatic, but still significant (70%), drop of Hsp72 levels was
seen after infection with si1, and no depletion of Hsp72 was seen
with si3 (not shown), which can be considered as an independent
negative control. The effects of si1 and si2 were highly specific to
Hsp72, because no change in expression of Hsc73, Hsp27, or
Hsp70-2 proteins was found after infection of cells with either si1
(not shown) or si2 retroviruses (Fig. 1B). Effects of si2 retrovirus
were also tested in HeLa and MCF-7 cells, and similar decreases in
Hsp72 expression were observed (Fig. 1A and C). Of note, all tumor
cell lines that we used have much higher levels of Hsp72
comparing with MCF10F normal breast epithelial cells (Fig. 1D).

Hsp72 Prevents Senescence of Cancer Cells

Figure 1. Specific depletion of Hsp72 by siRNA expressed on retroviral vector.
Cancer cell cultures were infected with retroviruses encoding siRNA that
target different regions of Hsp72. On day 7, postinfection samples were collected
and Hsp72, Hsc73, Hsp70-2, and Hsp27 were measured by immunoblotting
with the corresponding antibodies. A, lysates were probed with anti-Hsp72
SPA810 antibody. Cont., control. B and C, lysates were probed with anti-Hsc73/
Hsp72 SPA820 antibody and antibodies against Hsp70-2 and Hsp27, as
described in Materials and Methods. D, relative levels of Hsp72 in cell lines used
in this study.

We did not observe significant apoptosis after infection with si2
or si1 retroviruses in any of the tested cell lines. On the other hand,
depletion of Hsp72 led to dramatic changes in morphology and
growth properties of HCT116, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells, consistent
with cell senescence. In fact, microscopic observation of these cells
showed heterogeneous populations in which f50% of cells became
flat, vacuolized, and dramatically enlarged, which is typical for
senescent cells, whereas the rest of the cells became moderately
enlarged and did not look flattened (Supplementary Fig. S1B). No
changes in cell morphology were seen with si3-infected cells or
cells infected with empty retrovirus. There was also an f2-fold
reduction in the overall growth rate of si2-infected cells compared
with noninfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Of note, nontransformed breast epithelial cells MCF10F do not undergo
senescence or growth inhibition in response to depletion of
Hsp72 (not shown).
To further characterize cellular responses to Hsp72 depletion,
we investigated the proliferation potential of HeLa cells by
assessing BrdUrd incorporation. As can be seen in Fig. 2A,
depletion of Hsp72 reduced the fraction of BrdUrd-positive cells
by f50%, indicating cessation of DNA synthesis in a population
of cells. In line with this observation, fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis of Hsp72-depleted HeLa cells showed
that the fraction of cells in S-phase dropped by 50% (Fig. 2B),
whereas the fraction of G1 cells increased correspondingly (not
shown). Interestingly, in HCT116 cells, growth retardation was
associated mainly with an increase in a fraction of G2 cells
(Fig. 2C). As an independent measure of the proliferation defect
triggered by Hsp72 depletion, we measured the colony-forming
ability of HeLa and HCT116 cells upon si2 infection, and
observed f40% to 70% drop in cell clonogenicity in the Hsp72depleted cells (Fig. 2D).
A major test for senescence is h-galactosidase activity measured
at acidic pH (25). Hsp72 depletion in HCT116 cells led to the
appearance of f40% of h-gal–positive cells compared with 5% to

www.aacrjournals.org

8% in control population (Supplementary Fig. S1C; see also Fig. 6A
below). Because the h-galactosidase activity is very low in HeLa
cells, we used a different approach to test whether enlarged,
flattened cells are in fact senescent. As mentioned above, although
a population of cells acquired morphologic features typical of
senescence upon depletion of Hsp72 (40–50% of cells), the rest of
the cells were somewhat enlarged but continued to grow, although
at a slower pace. We hypothesized that this fraction of cells,
although not fully senescent, is in a presenescent state. This
hypothesis implies that these slower-growing cells may be prone to
senescence when treated with low concentrations of anticancer
drugs or subjected to low-intensity stresses. Therefore, we exposed
control and Hsp72-depleted HeLa cells to the DNA-damaging agent
doxorubicin. At concentrations below 20 nmol/L, doxorubicin did
not induce senescence-like morphologic changes in control cells;
however, it dramatically increased a fraction of cells with flat
morphology in culture with down-regulated Hsp72 (Fig. 2E). An
even more dramatic effect was seen with H2O2, which failed to
cause senescence in control HeLa cells at any concentration (high
concentrations led to cell death), while causing senescence of
almost the entire population of Hsp72-depleted HeLa cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). Similar enhancement of senescence
was also observed in Hsp72-depleted HCT116 cells after treatment
with low doses of doxorubicin or H2O2 (not shown).
These data indicate that depletion of Hsp72 led to senescence of
a fraction of cells, whereas the rest of the population became
metastable and easily pushed toward senescence upon treatment
with low doses of senescent-inducing agents.
Hsp72 depletion activates p53. The major tumor-suppressor
protein p53 is implicated in regulation of cell senescence both in
primary and cancer cells (22, 27). Therefore, we hypothesized that
senescence triggered by depletion of Hsp72 in cancer cells may
involve activation of p53 pathway. To address this question, we
assessed transcriptional activity of p53 upon depletion of Hsp72. To
achieve high efficiency of transfection, these experiments were
done with HeLa cells. These cells were transiently transfected with
three constructs in which the luciferase reporter was placed under
the control of known p53-regulated promoters, Mdm2, p21, and
Bax. To control for the efficiency of transfection, Hsp72-depleted
and control cells were transfected with luciferase under the control
of CMV promoter (CMV-Luc). As seen in Fig. 3A, depletion of
Hsp72 from HeLa cells led to a significant activation of p53dependent promoters, whereas CMV-Luc expression was not
affected. As an independent indication of enhanced p53 activity
under these conditions, we observed an f3-fold induction of
endogenous p21 (Fig. 3B). Induction of p21 upon Hsp72 depletion
was also seen with other cancer lines, including HCT116 and
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, with HCT116 cells, we
have found that depletion of Hsp72 leads to induction of Hdm2
(see Fig. 3C), a distinct major target of p53. Accordingly, the level of
phosphorylation of p53 at the activating site Ser15 also increased
after Hsp72 depletion in HCT116 (Fig. 3D) cells. However, the
increase in Ser15 phosphorylation after Hsp72 depletion was much
lower than that observed after DNA damage triggered by UV
irradiation (Fig. 3C and D). Interestingly, nontransformed MCF10F
cells did not show p53 activation in response to depletion of Hsp72,
which correlated with lack of senescence under these conditions.
Therefore, activation of p53 represents an important response of
cancer cell lines to reduction of Hsp72 levels. It seems that
increased levels of Hsp72 in cancer cells serve to prevent p53
activation and subsequently suppress the senescence program, and

Figure 2. Depletion of Hsp72 leads to cell senescence. A, inhibition of DNA synthesis in si2-infected cells. BrdUrd incorporation was measured as described in

down-regulation of Hsp72 in these cells activates both p53 and cell
senescence.
Activation of p53 after Hsp72 depletion is not mediated by
proteotoxic stress or DNA damage pathways. Because Hsp72
plays the major role in repair of stress-damaged polypeptides, we
suggested that Hsp72 depletion could lead to increased protein
damage in cells, resulting in activation of p53 and further
senescence. We, however, did not detect significant changes in
amounts of oxidatively damaged proteins after depletion of Hsp72
(see Supplementary Fig. S2A). Also, the ubiquitin-proteasome
machinery was not saturated in these cells because the levels of
ubiquitinated proteins, as judged by immunoblotting of cell lysates
with antiubiquitin antibodies, were not changed (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Furthermore, the rate of degradation of an unstable
reporter protein uGFP (28) was not reduced (not shown). These
data suggest that the chaperone capacity of cells after Hsp72
depletion was not compromised. To evaluate the chaperone
capability of Hsp72-depleted cells directly, we did luciferase
refolding assay after heat shock. We observed a minor but
reproducible defect in luciferase refolding in Hsp72-depleted cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). Thus, we concluded that expression of
Hsc73 and possibly other chaperones in these cells is sufficient to
handle damaged proteins, and therefore activation of p53 upon
depletion of Hsp72 seems not to be related to proteotoxicity.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

We next tested whether activation and Ser15 phosphorylation of
p53 observed in the Hsp72-depleted cells result from the activation
of DNA damage signaling pathways. Accordingly, we suggested
that Hsp72 depletion leads to DNA instability and stimulation of
ATM or ATR kinases. However, under these conditions, we did not
detect any significant DNA damage in either HCT116 or HeLa cells
as judged by alkaline comet assay that detects various types of
DNA damage. Of note, g irradiation–induced damage was readily
detected (Fig. 4A). Considering that DNA damage could be below
the sensitivity of the comet assay, but still sufficient to activate
ATM or ATR kinases, we investigated whether various substrates
of these kinases are phosphorylated upon Hsp72 depletion.
Accordingly, we assayed phosphorylation of the main substrates
of ATM and ATR kinases, including histone H2AX, Chk1, and Chk2,
by immunoblotting HCT116 cell lysates with antibodies against the
phosphorylated forms of these proteins. No phosphorylation of any
of these ATM/ATR substrates was seen after depletion of Hsp72,
whereas DNA damage caused by g or UV irradiation led to their
phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). We also did immunoblotting of cell
lysates with an antibody against a phosphorylated peptide that
represents a consensus site of ATM/ATR kinases, and did not
observe any difference in phosphorylation of ATM/ATR substrates
in lysates from Hsp72-depleted cells (not shown). Furthermore, no
autophosphorylation of ATM that is associated with its activation

was observed (Fig. 4B). We also did not detect significant
differences in histone H3-K9 acetylation, histone H4-K12 acetylation, or histone H3-K9 demethylation (not shown), which are seen
in cells with impaired genomic stability (29). These data together
indicate that Hsp72 depletion does not result in DNA damage, and
ATM/ATR pathways were not activated under these conditions.
Hsp72 depletion leads to p53 stabilization and inhibition of
Hdm2. Increase in p53 activity upon depletion of Hsp72 could be
associated with its stabilization and accumulation. In fact, the total
level of p53 increased in Hsp72-depleted cells (Fig. 5A). To assay for
the p53 stability upon Hsp72 depletion, HCT116 cells were treated
with emetine, and the levels of p53 were assayed at the indicated
time points. This experiment showed that p53 half-life increased
upon Hsp72 depletion from 30 to f50 min (Fig. 5B). Hsp72
depletion and g irradiation (5 Gy) of HCT116 cells led to similar
stabilization of p53 (Fig. 5B) and to the similar extent of p21
induction (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, Ser15 phosphorylation
after g irradiation was dramatically higher than that after
depletion of Hsp72 (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that the
extent of Ser15 phosphorylation is not indicative of p53 stability. To
test whether Ser15 phosphorylation plays a role in p53 stabilization
upon depletion of Hsp72, we expressed p53S15A mutant in
HCT116p53 / cells using a retroviral expression system. Stability
of the mutant p53 was assessed in these cells before and after
depletion of Hsp72, as described above. As seen in Fig. 5C,
depletion of Hsp72 strongly stabilized p53S15A mutant, indicating
that the stabilization is independent of the phosphorylation.
We further tested the possibility that activation of p53 upon
Hsp72 depletion could be due to inhibition of Hdm2, a ubiquitin
ligase that controls p53 stability and also acts as a direct inhibitor
of p53. As mentioned above, we observed an f2-fold increase of
Hdm2 levels in Hsp72-depleted cells (Fig. 3C). Because Hdm2 is a
direct target of p53, this increase probably reflects the enhanced
p53 activity. The fact that p53 was stabilized and active in spite of
higher levels of Hdm2 indicated that Hdm2 had reduced activity
under these conditions and therefore was not proficient in
inhibiting and ubiquitinating p53.
Low activity of Hdm2 could result from its self-ubiquitination
and destabilization. In fact, it was recently reported that Hdm2
self-ubiquitination abolishes its interactions with p53 and leads to
Hdm2 inactivation (30). It is noteworthy that Hdm2 destabilization

does not always correlate with decrease in its total levels, because
Hdm2 degradation may be efficiently counteracted by enhanced
p53-dependent transcription. Therefore, we hypothesized that
depletion of Hsp72 may lead to Hdm2 self-ubiquitination and
destabilization, resulting in its inactivation. To investigate the rate
of Hdm2 degradation upon Hsp72 depletion, HCT116 cells were
treated with emetine, and the levels of Hdm2 were assayed at the
indicated time points. We observed that in spite of higher initial
levels of Hdm2 in Hsp72-depleted cells, the rate of its degradation
was f3-fold higher (Fig. 3D).
Because Hdm2 and p53 represent components of a negative
feedback loop, which obscures analysis of the effects of Hsp72
depletion on Hdm2 degradation, it was critical to assess such
effects in cells that lack p53. Accordingly, Hsp72-depleted HCT116
p53 / cells were treated with emetine, and the levels of Hdm2
were assayed at the indicated time points. In these cells, similar to
parental cells, Hsp72 depletion led to strong acceleration of Hdm2
degradation (Fig. 5E). Therefore, effects of Hsp72 on stability of
Hdm2 are independent of the presence of p53. In conclusion, it
seems that Hsp72 depletion leads to Hdm2 destabilization and
inhibition, which results in activation of p53.
Senescence upon depletion of Hsp72 involves p53-dependent
and p53-independent pathways. As mentioned above, a Cdk
inhibitor p21 that is known to regulate p53-mediated senescence in
primary cells was strongly induced in HeLa, HCT116, and MCF-7
cells upon depletion of Hsp72 (see Fig. 3B). To investigate whether
the observed increase in p21 was responsible for the onset of
senescence under these conditions, we took advantage of the p21
knockout derivative of HCT116 cells. In contrast to control HCT116
cells, in which depletion of Hsp72 was not toxic, depletion of Hsp72
in the HCT116 p21 / cells led to death of f50% of cells (not
shown). However, senescence in the remaining population of the
knockout cells was significantly lower compared with the parental
cells (Fig. 6A), suggesting that induction of p21 upon Hsp72 depletion
critically contributes to activation of the senescent pathway.
To investigate the role of p53 in induction of senescence after
Hsp72 depletion, we used a p53 knockout derivative of human
colon tumor cells, HCT116 p53 / . In these cells, the background
levels of p21 were dramatically lower than in parental cells
(Fig. 6B). Depletion of Hsp72 in HCT116 p53 / cells led to an f2fold increase in p21 expression. However, the p21 levels seen under

these conditions were not higher than the p21 levels seen in the
naı̈ve parental HCT116 cells (Fig. 6B, top). Furthermore, the activity
of p21 in HCT116 p53 / was also dramatically reduced as judged
by the relief of a p21-dependent inhibition of topoisomerase IIa
expression (Fig. 6B, bottom). Surprisingly, in spite of a dramatic
reduction of p21 levels and activity, Hsp72 depletion in the p53
knockout cells still led to significant senescence (Fig. 6A).

Senescence of p53 knockout cells caused by Hsp72 depletion was in
apparent contradiction with the lack of senescence in p21 knockout
cells because p21 levels are low in p53 knockout cells under these
conditions (see Fig. 6B). Such a contradiction could be explained by
extensive death of p21 knockout cells upon depletion of Hsp72 (see
above), associated with strong overexpression of p53 in these cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Therefore, the lack of senescence in p21

knockout cells upon depletion of Hsp72 could potentially result from
p53-induced death of cells that otherwise would become senescent.
To further address a role of p21 in senescence, we investigated the
response to Hsp72 depletion of cells with combined p53 and p21
depletion. HCT116p53 / cells were infected with two retroviruses
encoding siRNAs against p21 (Supplementary Fig. S4) and Hsp72.
This double infection was not toxic, allowing us to assay the extent
of senescence in these cells as described above. As seen in Fig. 6A,
there was a small but reproducible reduction of the number of
senescent cells upon Hsp72 depletion in double p53/p21–depleted
cells compared with p53 depletion alone. These data indicate that
p21 contributes to cell senescence upon depletion of Hsp72, but
that an alternative p53/p21–independent senescence pathway is
also triggered under these conditions.
The p53-independent pathway did not involve p27 or p16 Cdk
inhibitors because p27 was not induced in either p53 knockout or
parental HCT116 cells after Hsp72 depletion (not shown), and p16
is not expressed in this cell line (31). Of note, no accumulation of

www.aacrjournals.org

either p16 or p27 was detected upon Hsp72 depletion in HeLa cells
as well (not shown).
To gain insight into the p53-independent pathway of senescence,
we analyzed the effects of Hsp72 depletion on the cell cycle
distribution of HCT116 p53 / cells using FACS analysis. We
observed that Hsp72 depletion in HCT116 p53 / cells led to an
increase of G2-M population (Fig. 6C). Because G2-M checkpoint is
mainly regulated by Cdc2 kinase, and because G2-M–associated
senescence in certain cells is mediated by Cdc2 down-regulation
(32), we investigated the status of this kinase in HCT116 p53 /
cells upon Hsp72 depletion. Activation of the G2-M checkpoint
typically leads to Cdc2 inactivation through inhibitory phosphorylation of Tyr15. We observed an f2-fold increase of Tyr15phosphorylated form of Cdc2, indicating inhibition of this kinase.
Moreover, the total level of Cdc2 was significantly decreased under
these conditions (Fig. 6D).
It was previously shown that DNA-damaging stresses trigger
phosphorylation of Cdc2 at Tyr15 by inhibiting or destabilizing

Cdc2 phosphatases, Cdc25A or Cdc25C (see ref. 33 for review).
Accordingly, we measured the rates of Cdc2 dephosphorylation in
control and Hsp72-depleted cells (see Materials and Methods).
Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in rates of Cdc2
dephosphorylation (Fig. 6E), indicating that Cdc25 phosphatases
function normally in these cells. Therefore, Hsp72 depletion
inactivates Cdc2 via a novel mechanism, which probably involves
stimulation of Tyr15-specific kinases, Wee1 or Myt1, rather than
suppression of Cdc2-specific phosphatases. Interestingly, we
observed similar accumulation of Tyr15-phosphorylated Cdc2
and similar reduction of total Cdc2 levels in parental HCT116
cells. These data suggest that elevated levels of Hsp72 in cancer
cells keep in check both p53- and Cdc2-mediated senescence
pathways, thus promoting cell proliferation. Based on these data,
we conclude that increased levels of Hsp72 in many tumor cell
lines serve to protect them from default senescence. Moreover,
Hsp72 depletion promotes senescence of cancer cells via two
independent pathways (i.e., either through activation of p53/p21
or stimulation of inhibitory phosphorylation and down-regulation
of Cdc2).

Discussion
Here, we report that increased constitutive expression of Hsp72
in several cancer cell lines is critical for cell proliferation and
survival, because specific depletion of Hsp72 led to reduction of
growth rate, drop in clonogenicity, and cell senescence. Hsp72
depletion led to activation of p53 as judged by transcriptional
activation of exogenous and endogenous p53-dependent promoters (Fig. 3) as well as accumulation of Ser15 phosphorylated
form of p53 (see Fig. 3D). These data indicate that constitutive
overexpression of Hsp72 plays an important role in suppression of
default senescent pathways in cancer cells. Because p53 pathway
seems to be among the major targets of Hsp72, this heat shock
protein seems to provide an advantage to cancer cells by
counteracting potential growth-inhibitory or proapoptotic effects
of p53.
In many cancers, suppression of the p53 pathway is achieved by
mutations and deletions of p53 or Arf (34), or by amplification or
activation of Mdm2 or MdmX (35). Our novel findings suggest that
suppression of p53 system in cancer cells may be alternatively
achieved by overexpressing Hsp72. Activation of p53 is known to
either stimulate apoptosis through up-regulation of proapoptotic
proteins like Bax or Puma, or it can lead to growth arrest and cell
senescence via up-regulation of the Cdk inhibitor p21 (36).
Interestingly, in all tested cell lines in which Hsp72 depletion led
to activation of the p53 pathway, we observed a robust upregulation of p21 and senescence but not apoptosis. It is
noteworthy that in these lines, including HeLa, HCT116, and
MCF-7, in contrast to lymphoid cells, activation of p53 by DNAdamaging agents at low doses also usually triggers senescence
rather than apoptosis. Dominance of senescence over apoptosis in
our experiments with Hsp72 depletion could also result from a
prolonged activation of p53 at relatively modest levels.
Depletion of Hsp72 did not lead to any detectable reduction in
the capability of the cells to handle abnormal proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This is not very surprising because
HCT116 cells have relatively high levels of a homologous
housekeeping member of the family Hsc73, as well as other
chaperones (e.g., Hsp27; Fig. 1). Therefore, it seems that Hsp72
specifically control p53- and cdc2-senescent pathways. Interest-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

ingly, this activity of Hsp72 seems to be related to cancer cells
because we did not observe either activation of p53 or senescence
in a nontransformed breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10, which has
a normal p53 pathway. These data is consistent with the idea that
overexpression of Hsp72 represents a response of cancer cells to
activation of p53.
p53 activation commonly follows DNA-damaging stresses.
Therefore, we tested whether Hsp72 depletion activates p53 via
stimulation of DNA damage signaling pathways. However, we
neither observed any DNA damage (Fig. 4A) nor detected
activation of any components of the DNA-damage signaling
pathways (Fig. 4B) upon Hsp 72 depletion. Nevertheless, Hsp72
depletion led to accumulation of Ser15 phosphorylated form of p53
(Fig. 3C). These data suggest that background levels of ATR kinase
may be important for Ser15 phosphorylation.
Hsp72 depletion led to increased levels of Hdm2, which likely
resulted from increased p53 activity (Fig. 3C). Despite higher Hdm2
levels, p53 was stabilized (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Hdm2 activity
was low. Importantly, despite increased expression of Hdm2, its
stability was markedly reduced in Hsp72-depleted cells compared
with control cells (Fig. 5D and E). Most likely, decreased stability of
Hdm2 resulted from its self-ubiquitination, which, in turn, could
interfere with the ability of Hdm2 to bind and ubiquitinate p53
(30). Because p53 and Hdm2 represent components of a negative
feedback regulatory loop, it was difficult to identify primary events
in p53 regulation. However, the effect of Hsp72 on Hdm2
degradation was seen even in the p53 knockout cells (see Fig.
5E). Therefore, the presented data strongly suggest that destabilization and subsequent inactivation of Hdm2 upon Hsp72
depletion is independent of p53 and, thus, can account for p53
activation. It is not clear, however, whether effects of Hsp72
depletion on Hdm2 stability are direct or mediated via other
components, such as MdmX or c-Abl.
In addition to p53-mediated senescence, we showed that Hsp72
controls a distinct pathway that could be activated in both p53positive and p53-knockout cells. The p53-independent pathway of
senescence triggered by Hsp72 depletion leads to G2-M phase cell
cycle arrest and is related to inactivation of the cell cycle kinase
Cdc2 (Fig. 6). In fact, Hsp72 depletion leads to a 2-fold reduction in
total Cdc2 levels and simultaneously results in accumulation of
inactive, Tyr15 phosphorylated form of Cdc2. The common
mechanism of controlling Cdc2 activity is through regulating the
rate of its dephosphorylation by a family of Cdc25 phosphatases
(33). However, upon depletion of Hsp72, we did not observe
decrease in the rates of Cdc2 Tyr15 dephosphorylation (see Fig. 6E).
Therefore, other mechanisms of Cdc2 regulation, probably
involving Wee or Myt kinases, have to be involved.
Understanding mechanisms of senescence caused by Hsp72
depletion may have a practical outcome, because development of
Hsp72 inhibitors may become a novel, interesting approach toward
sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy and overcoming
resistance.
