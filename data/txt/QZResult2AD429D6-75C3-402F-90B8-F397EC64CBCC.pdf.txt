BACKGROUND: Through this study, the authors sought to investigate the biologic and immunologic effects of preoperative trastuzumab in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. METHODS: Patients with DCIS
were enrolled in this open-label phase 2 trial and tested for HER2. Trastuzumab was given by intravenous infusion (8
mg/kg). The patients then had surgery 14 to 28 days after treatment. Tissue and peripheral blood samples were
obtained before therapy and at the time of surgery to examine residual disease and immunologic response. RESULTS:
Median age of the 69 enrolled patients was 53 years, mean mammographic size of the DCIS lesions was 5.2  1.2 cm,
and 24 patients (35%) were found to have HER2 overexpression/amplification (12 received trastuzumab and 12
untreated patients provided tissue for blinded, controlled biomarker analyses). No overt histologic evidence of
response was noted. No significant change in mean pretherapy staining for Ki-67 (44.3  3.4%) and cleaved caspase3 (2.6  0.8%) was noted when surgical specimens from drug-treated patient samples were compared with those not
treated. Trastuzumab significantly augmented antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in 100% of
patients; this was demonstrated to be mediated through CD56þ degranulating natural killer cells (P < .01). One
patient developed a significant anti-HER2 humoral CD4 T-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose monotherapy
with trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive DCIS does not result in significant, clinically overt, histologic, antiproliferative, or apoptotic changes, but does result in the ability to mount ADCC mediated through natural killer cells
and may also induce T-cell dependent humoral immunity. Further studies of trastuzumab for DCIS appear warranted.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the fourth leading cause of cancer among women in the United States, with

approximately 64,000 cases diagnosed annually.1 There is a critical need for the development and investigation of agents
that can either eradicate DCIS, thereby averting surgery and radiation, or prevent frankly invasive disease in most patients.
Several lines of evidence suggest the logic in studying trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2/neu
(HER2), for the treatment of DCIS. Neoadjuvant trastuzumab may be able to prevent the development of invasive breast
cancer in patients with DCIS in much the same way that tamoxifen markedly decreases the risk of breast cancer development in women with high-risk proliferative lesions such as atypical ductal hyperplasia.2 A further rationale for studying
neoadjuvant trastuzumab for DCIS relates to the scarcity of effective medical treatments for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative DCIS. Additional support for studying the efficacy of trastuzumab against DCIS comes from promising results from
trials of neoadjuvant trastuzumab for invasive breast cancer. Gennari et al showed that administration of a short, preoperative course of single-agent trastuzumab to 11 patients with early stage invasive breast cancer resulted in a complete pathologic response in 1 patient and partial responses in 4.3 The in vivo mechanism of action of trastuzumab is not completely

understood. In animal models the activity of trastuzumab
is dependent on the engagement of Fc-receptor expressing
lymphocytes, suggesting that ADCC is a major mechanism of action.4 Other investigators have demonstrated
development of a T-cell dependent humoral response.5
We hypothesized that trastuzumab would have substantial
activity against DCIS, perhaps even more than it has
against invasive breast cancer, because the volume of disease in DCIS patients is normally much lower. This study
is the first prospective trial of neoadjuvant trastuzumab in
patients diagnosed with DCIS that overexpresses HER2
to test this hypothesis and to study individual patients’
immune responses with therapy to elucidate potential
mechanisms of trastuzumab activity. This trial utilized a
blinded controlled analysis of selected biomarkers in
treated cases before and after therapy and in untreated
patients with HER2-positive DCIS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was a prospective, open-label, phase 2 trial
approved by and conducted at The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between March 2005 and
February 2009.
Patient Selection and Eligibility
Patients with histologically confirmed DCIS showing
measurable residual microcalcifications on mammography after initial diagnostic biopsy were counseled
regarding the study. To be eligible, patients were required
to have adequate bone marrow, renal, cardiac, and liver
function, and women of childbearing potential were
required to have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test.
Eligible patients were required to give informed consent
before testing their DCIS for HER2 status. Once consent
was obtained, HER2 status was determined using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis (AB8 Neomarkers; Labvision, Fremont, Calif) or fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH; PathVysion assay kit; Vysis, Inc., Downers Grove,
Ill). DCIS was considered to be positive if determined to
be HER2 3þ by IHC or positive for HER2 gene amplification (HER2/CEP17 ratio >2.0) by FISH.
Treatment Schedule
Patients with HER2-positive DCIS were eligible to
receive the study drug. Trastuzumab was provided free of
charge to all patients by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif). Trastuzumab was given at a dosage of 8 mg/
kg over a 90-minute intravenous infusion, and patients

40

were scheduled for surgery 14 to 28 days after treatment.
Surgical procedures were dictated by the extent of disease
and patient preference. Adverse events were graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Correlative Studies
Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry

Processing was performed according to routine,
clinical pathology tissue processing methods. IHC analyses for Ki-67, a nuclear marker for cell proliferation
(Clone MIB-1, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and cleaved
caspase-3 (Asp175), 1 of the key executioners of apoptosis
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass), were performed in duplicate using residual formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy tissue sections that
contained DCIS before treatment and from the corresponding FFPE tissues that contained DCIS from the surgical resection.
Untreated control samples

Tissue samples collected from enrolled patients with
HER2 overexpression/amplification who gave informed
consent to participate in the study, but did not receive
study drug,because of surgical scheduling or patient preference, served as internal negative controls. All analyses were
performed by investigators who were blinded to clinical information, including receipt or nonreceipt of study drug.
Isolation of sera and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients

Peripheral blood collected with anticoagulant was
used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) by standard Ficoll gradient centrifugation
(Accu-Prep Lymphocites, Oslo, Norway). After centrifugation, PBMCs were washed with medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and resuspended in 90%
FBSþ 10% DMSO at a concentration of 10  106/mL.
Evaluation of antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC)

Patient’s PBMCs were tested for their killing
capacity against a HER2-overexpressing target cell line
(MDA-MB-361) in the presence of simultaneously harvested autologous serum. The MDA-MB-361 cell line
was validated by STR DNA fingerprinting using the
AmpFlSTR Identifiler Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
Calif). ADCC by trastuzumab was measured in a 51Cr
release assay using radiolabeled target cells from the

HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-361. To this end, 1-3 million MDA-MB-361
target cells were labeled with 100 lCi (3.7 MBq) of
Na51Cr (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass) for 1 hour at
37 C, washed extensively, and used as targets. Five thousand 51Cr-labeled target cells per well were seeded into
96-well U-bottomed plates. Experiments were conducted
in triplicate at PBMC (effector) to MDA-MB-361 (target) ratios of 12.5:1, 25:1, and 50:1, in 200 lL of RPMI
1640 containing 20% autologous human serum. The
antibody source for evaluation of ADCC was made up of
trastuzumab, autologous serum of treated patients, or
both. Thus, all ADCC experiments were carried out in
the presence of 20% autologous serum, with or without
10 lg/mL of trastuzumab (added exogenously). After 4
hours at 37 C in humidified air with 5% CO2, the release
of 51Cr was determined by taking 100 lL of supernatant
and counting using a Wizard 1470 Automate gamma
counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass). Maximal and
spontaneous 51Cr release values were obtained by adding
either 1 % Tween detergent (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA) or complete medium, respectively, to microtiter wells
containing 5  103 labeled target cells. The percentage of
lysis was calculated according to the standard formula
((counts per minute experimental) – (counts per minute
spontaneous release))/((counts per minute maximum
release) – (counts per minute spontaneous release))  100.
Flow cytometry analysis of PBMC effectors
for ADCC

An 8-parameter flow cytometric analysis of thawed
PBMC was performed using a 3-laser FACSCanto II
instrument equipped with DIVA software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif). To identify phenotype modifications
of effector lymphocytes involved in trastuzumab-mediated cytotoxicity, as well as the frequency of effector natural killer (NK) and T cell populations among PBMCs
4105, the PBMCs prepared for use in the ADCC assay
were left in parallel cultures with unlabeled MDA-MB361 target cells at an effector-to-target ratio of 25:1 in the
presence of 20% autologous serum, or trastuzumab (10
lg/mL), or in their absence (negative control), in otherwise identical culture conditions of ADCC assay. To test
CD107a mobilization, anti-CD107a-Alexa Fluor 488conjugated (mouse IgG1, H4A3, eBioscience, San Diego,
Calif) was added at 1 lg/106 cells at the beginning of culture. One hour into the culture, GolgiStop was added
(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif) in accordance with
manufacturer’s instructions. At the end of culture (6 hours

total), cells were harvested, washed, and directly stained
with 1 lg/106 cells of each of the following mAbs: antiCD3-PE (UCHT1, mouse IgG1), anti-CD56-APC
(B159, mouse IgG1), anti-CD16-PECy7 (3G8, mouse
IgG1), anti-CD69-APCCy7 (FN50, mouse IgG1), CD8Pacific Blue (RPA-T8, mouse IgG1), CD4-PerCPCy5.5
(SK3, mouse IgG1) (all from BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, Calif), and LIVE/DEAD Aqua Cell Stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) or with isotype-matched mAbs of
irrelevant specificity or with isotype-matched mAbs. Cells
were then fixed and analyzed within 24 hours.
HER2–specific CD4 IFN-c enzyme-linked
immunospots

Fourteen HER2-derived peptides, each known to
bind to multiple HLA-DR molecules,5,6 were used to
detect T-cell responses by the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) method.7 The peptides, which are designated by the position of the first amino acid (Pool I: p98,
p369, p927; Pool II: p776, p62, p77; Pool III: p83, p88,
p350; Pool IV: p976, p42, p688; and Pool V: p971,
p1166) were all class II peptides that have been previously
described.5,6,8,9 Both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/
ionomycin and tetanus toxoid were used as positive controls. In brief, cryopreserved PBMCs were cultured at 2 
105 cells per well in 96-well plates for 7 days in medium
containing pools of HER2 peptides (pools of 2 or 3 peptides, each at 10 lg/mL) or with HIV peptide control
(negative control). In these cases, all of the time points
were assessed with the same panels of peptides. Interleukin-2 (10 U/mL) was added at Day 5. On Day 7, peptide
and irradiated autologous PBMCs (2  105 per well)
were added as antigen-presenting cells. On Day 8, the
cells were gently transferred to the ELISPOT plate for
detection of spots with a pair of IFNc-specific antibodies
(Mabtech, Mariemont, Ohio). ELISPOTs were developed, dried, and read with a C.T.L. Immunospot ELISPOT reader, using the programs Image Acquisition 4.4
and Immunospot 3 (Cellular Technology Ltd, Shaker
Heights, Ohio). Peptide-specific immune reactivity was
determined by subtracting the background spots in the
HIV wells. A positive response was defined as peptide-specific spots that were statistically higher (triplicates) than
control wells using a 2-tailed t test (P < .05). A zero
response was assigned if the peptide-specific wells were
not different from control wells. The counts for each peptide were summed and presented as the total HER2–specific T-cells per million PBMC, assessed at each time
point.6

Isolation and detection of trastuzumab within the
breast ductal fluids of a treated patient

Nipple aspirate fluid was obtained from patient
number 7 at the time of surgery as previously described.10
The fluid droplets were collected and centrifuged at 1500
RPM for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was stored at
80 C until measurement. Detection and quantification
of trastuzumab in the ductal fluid were kindly performed
by the laboratory of Dr. David Jamieson at Northern
Institute for Cancer Research, University of Newcastle
upon Tyne, using a cell-based ELISA assay that measures
the interaction between trastuzumab and formalin-fixed
HER2þ SKBR3 cells.11
Statistical Considerations
Twelve evaluable patients were required to characterize
the change in proliferation rate after treatment with a single dose of trastuzumab. To accrue 12 evaluable patients
with DCIS, trastuzumab administration, surgery, and
post surgery biomarkers testing, it was estimated that up
to 71 patients needed to be registered in the study. A 6%
absolute reduction in the proliferation rate, as measured
by Ki-67, was designated as the study endpoint, providing
sufficient preliminary data to pursue larger clinical studies
with trastuzumab for DCIS. To compare ADCC and
CD4þ T-cell response in each patient observed at preand post-treatment times, paired analysis was performed
using Student t test. Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum
test was used to compare data between groups. Statistical
tests were performed with Prism 4 software (San Diego,
Calif), and P < .05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
Clinical and Pathologic Characteristics of
Enrolled Subjects
Sixty-nine patients were enrolled in the trial (median age,
53 years). Overall, 24 (35%) patients had lesions with
overexpression or amplification of HER2. HER2-overexpression/amplification correlated with histologic grade
and ER expression. Overall, 6% of patients had grade I,
38% had grade II, and 56% had grade III lesions. Patients
with high-grade lesions were more likely to exhibit
HER2-overexpression/amplification (0% grade I, 27%
grade II, and 44% in grade III, respectively; P ¼ .10).
Overall, 81% of the DCIS cases were ER positive. HER2overexpression/amplification was significantly more likely
in ER negative versus ER positive DCIS (62% vs 28%,
respectively; P ¼ .047).

42

After receipt of HER2 testing results, 12 patients
received study drug and 12 patients did not receive study
drug, either because of surgical scheduling constraints or a
final decision not to take the study drug after receiving the
HER2 results.
On average, surgery was performed at 18.085.21
days after administration of trastuzumab. Patients receiving trastuzumab had large DCIS lesions with the mean
mammographic extent of disease measuring 5.15  1.15
cm. Mastectomy was performed in the majority of
patients (n ¼ 8 of 12) with immediate breast reconstruction in all but 1 patient. The mean final pathologic size of
the DCIS for these 12 patients was 5.15  3.73 cm. In
addition to DCIS, 42% (n ¼ 5) of the patients evidenced
invasive breast cancer on their pathologic specimen. The
mean size of invasive cancer in these patients was 0.28 cm;
none of these patients was found to have sentinel lymph
node metastases.
Toxicity and Adverse Events
Three patients (25%) had an adverse event reported during the study period. Two patients experienced a grade I
or II infusion reaction consisting of chills or chills and
fever, which resolved with administration of diphenhydramine and acetaminophen or hydrocortisone and meperidine, respectively. One 49 year-old participant with a
distant history of adult-onset seizure developed grade I
right upper lip numbness 3 days after infusion of study
drug, which resolved without further intervention. Complete neurologic workup was within normal limits.
Pathologic Response
Each of the 12 treated patients had residual DCIS at the
time of surgery, without overt histopathologic evidence of
response to treatment.
Proliferative and Apoptotic Studies
Pre- and post-treatment tissue with DCIS was studied for
proliferation and apoptosis in patients treated with trastuzumab. Tissue from the additional 12 patients who did
not receive study drug was evaluated as an internal control. The mean percent Ki-67 staining was 44.29 
3.42% and the mean percent cleaved caspase-3 staining
was 2.59  0.78% for DCIS tissue from all initial biopsy
specimens. After administration of trastuzumab, Ki-67
staining increased on average by 16.11% and cleaved caspase-3 staining increased on average by 2.3%, as measured
in tissue before and after treatment (Fig. 1). For patients
not receiving study drug, Ki-67 staining increased on

average by 17.23% and cleaved caspase-3 staining
increased on average by 4.15% (Fig. 1). No significant
differences were identified with respect to percent change
in Ki-67 staining (P ¼ .75) or cleaved caspase-3 staining
(P ¼ .65) between patients who did and did not receive
trastuzumab.

Immune Response Correlative Studies
To investigate the role of ADCC in patients with DCIS
enrolled in this study, cell-mediated cytotoxic activity was
evaluated ex vivo in 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assays using
patient PBMCs in the presence of autologous serum versus HER2-overexpressing breast cancer target cells. As
demonstrated in Figure 2, ADCC exerted by PBMC in
the presence of autologous sera increased significantly for
9 of 9 (100%) patients tested where sufficient cells were
available after the single dose of trastuzumab (P < .0035).
Taking into account all evaluable patients, the increase

was significant, but there was considerable heterogeneity
in the response. These data confirm that trastuzumab was
present in the serum of patients receiving the drug and
suggest that ADCC may occur in vivo and contribute to
trastuzumab’s mechanism of action.
To identify the effector cells involved in trastuzumab-mediated cytotoxicity, flow cytometry was used to
analyze the phenotype of lymphocytes cultured for the
ADCC assay. Classical ADCC is mediated by NK cells;
therefore, we focused the analysis on this population,
defined as CD56þCD16. As demonstrated in Figure
3A, which depicts 1 representative patient, after administration of trastuzumab there was increased expression of
cell surface secreted CD107a, a molecule linked to the
killing activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes. The percentage
of CD56þCD107aþ degranulating NK cells was calculated by subtracting the percentage of CD56þCD107aþ

mab (P < .00005). These data suggest that ADCC
induced by trastuzumab treatment in DCIS patients is
mediated by degranulating CD56þ NK cells.
ELISPOT assays were used to determine CD4 Tcell responses against multiple HER2-derived class II peptides. The peptides were evaluated as pools and the composition of each of the 5 pools. There were 9 evaluable
patients who had sufficient PBMC available pre- and
post-treatment. The frequency of HER2 peptide-poolspecific T-cells for each patient is shown in Table 1. Table
1 depicts the pre- and post-treatment HER2-specific Tcell levels in the 9 patients with evaluable PBMC at both
time points. Each point is the total CD4 T-cell frequency
calculated by summing the counts for each peptide and
subtracting out counts against the control peptide. Only 1
patient had a significant CD4 T-cell response (Pool II and
V), suggesting that a single dose of trastuzumab did not
promote a generalized T-cell dependent response in these
patients with DCIS.

end of the culture, cells were stained with CD56 and CD107a
and analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry with gating

Detection of Trastuzumab in Ductal Fluids
Before this publication, it was unknown whether trastuzumab could pass through the basement membrane or be
secreted into the breast ducts in humans. In 1 treated
patient, ductal fluids were obtained at the time of surgery
on Day 18 after administration of trastuzumab. Trastuzumab was demonstrated to be present within the ducts at a
level of 161 lg/mL.

DISCUSSION
This study is the first to report on the use of neoadjuvant
trastuzumab for patients with HER2 positive DCIS. We
have found that single dose monotherapy with trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive DCIS does not
result in significant, clinically overt histologic, anti-proliferative, or apoptotic changes, but does result in the specific ability to mount ADCC mediated through NK cells
and may also induce humoral immunity in a T-cell dependent manner.
Before this study, it was not known what alterations
in the histologic appearance might be seen using trastuzumab for DCIS. In the neoadjuvant setting for invasive
cancer, histologic changes seen after administration of
trastuzumab with chemotherapy can range from minimal
effect to marked decreases in size and cellularity to complete eradication of any evidence of disease (complete
pathologic response).12 After 1 cycle of trastuzumab given
in the present study for DCIS, no particular morphologic

number of CD4þ T cells per million PBMC, calculated from triplicate determinations. All values are statistically higher than the no-antigen–containing control
wells.
Only patient 12 had statistically significant increased reactivity in pools II and V. The positive pools in patient 12 were retested using the individual peptides
from each pool. Peptides p776 and p62 both demonstrated specific, significantly increased activity (P < .05). Peptide p971 from pool V was not significant,
and p1166 from pool V showed a trend toward significance on repeat single peptide-specific testing (P ¼ .07)

changes were noted. Changes in proliferation (Ki-67) and
apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) were therefore investigated
to better evaluate the tissue effects of a single dose of trastuzumab on DCIS. Compared with patients not receiving
trastuzumab, there was no significant change in proliferation or apoptosis. Two previous studies enrolling patients
with HER2-overexpressing invasive breast cancer have
evaluated proliferation after short-course trastuzumab
therapy. Mohsin et al evaluated a 3-week shortcourse of
trastuzumab in patients with locally advanced invasive
breast cancer and, consistent with our findings, noted no
change in proliferation as measured by Ki-67.13 A second
study by Gennari et al evaluated 11 patients that received
a loading dose of trastuzumab followed by 3 weekly
doses.3 They also noted no change in proliferation. These
data are in contrast to in vitro data investigating potential
mechanisms of action of trastuzumab in the laboratory. In
vitro blockade of the HER2 receptor results in upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27, which can inhibit
cyclin E/cdk2 complexes and produce G1 cell cycle arrest,
with a concomitant reduction in proliferation.14,15

Despite not seeing a decrease in proliferation, Mohsin et al reported clinical responses evidenced by significant tumor regression.13 These authors performed
additional studies to investigate the mechanism of this cytotoxic effect and were able to demonstrate a significant
increase in apoptosis. These data are notable because, in
in vitro models using cultured breast cancer cells, trastuzumab has not proven capable of inducing apoptosis.13
In the current study, we did not see evidence of increased
apoptosis in DCIS patients treated with trastuzumab.
Both our study and the one by Mohsin et al were investigating apoptosis in vivo and both used the same assay—
suggesting the differences cannot be explained by methodology. It is likely that this difference derives from the
fact the current study enrolled patients with noninvasive
cancer, whereas the study by Mohsin et al enrolled
patients with very large, advanced invasive tumors that
were more susceptible to therapy. It is possible that longer
treatment may be required to see changes in histology
or biomarkers in patients with DCIS treated with
trastuzumab.

These data also highlight the finding that the mechanism by which trastuzumab exerts its therapeutic action
remains incompletely understood. Mechanisms of action
of trastuzumab include inhibition of HER2 extracellular
domain proteolysis, disruption of downstream signaling
pathways, G1 cell-cycle arrest, inhibition of DNA repair,
suppression of angiogenesis, and induction of
ADCC.16,17 One mechanism of action shown to be significant in vivo, first in a mouse model and then in the
shortcourse trastuzumab trial conducted by Gennari et al,
is ADCC.3,18 Our data also demonstrated ADCC activity
by PBMC obtained from patients treated with trastuzumab in the presence of autologous serum. This finding
confirmed that there was trastuzumab in the serum of
these patients, which is consistent with the known long
half-life of this agent.11 It also confirmed that ADCC is a
potential mechanism of action by which trastuzumab may
exert cytotoxic activity. It is important to note, however,
that these data are from an ex vivo assay and do not confirm that ADCC occurred in our patients. The finding
that apoptosis, considered the final pathway for ADCCmediated cytotoxicity, did not arise suggests that significant ADCC was not occurring in vivo in these patients.13
To further assess the immune response, we looked
for evidence that HER2-specific immunity was being
induced. In a study evaluating patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, Taylor et al demonstrated a
significant increase in the anti-HER2 humoral response
associated with an increase in HER2-specific CD4þ Tcell responses.5 This suggests that the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab can not only provide passive immunotherapy through ADCC, but also induce active immunity
by promoting a cellular response. In the current study,
only 1 patient had a significant CD4þ T-cell response,
suggesting that a single dose of trastuzumab does not promote a generalized T-cell response in most patients with
DCIS.
As DCIS by pathologic definition remains within
the breast ducts, it was of interest to determine whether
trastuzumab could be detected within nonlactating human
ductal fluids. Immunoglobulins are known to be secreted
in the milk, and trastuzumab has been detected in milk of
lactating monkeys given intravenous trastuzumab.19 In
the current study, trastuzumab was shown, using a new
cell-based ELISA for quantification of trastuzumab in
human plasma,11 to cross the basement membrane in a
nonlactating patient with DCIS and enter the breast ducts.
The assay, developed and validated by Jamieson et al, spe-

cifically measures the interaction between trastuzumab
and HER2.11 This is the first published study to demonstrate the presence of trastuzumab in human ductal fluids
and show that trastuzumab can theoretically act on cancer
cells located within the breast ducts.
Some clinicians have voiced concern that preoperative studies of DCIS run the risk of undertreating women
who have a concurrent occult invasive breast cancer. In
the current study, 45% of patients did, in fact, have an
occult, small, invasive cancer detected in the surgical specimen. There was an inherent selection bias resulting from
surgery scheduling issues in favor of enrolling patients
with very large DCIS in the current study. Patients who
were going to schedule a mastectomy with immediate
reconstruction (87.5% of patients chose immediate
reconstruction) were more likely to participate in the
study than patients with much smaller DCIS who could
be immediately scheduled for segmental resection. The
average size of the DCIS was over 5 cm in this study, and
it has been established that larger size is an independent
risk factor for finding occult invasive cancer.20 Another
potential selection bias for identification of occult invasive
cancer in a high proportion of treated patients may
involve the overexpression of HER2. In a recent study
published by Roses et al, invasive disease was found in
association with HER2-overexpressing DCIS at a higher
frequency than with DCIS that did not overexpress
HER2.21 Despite these legitimate concerns, the current
study is important because we have demonstrated that a
DCIS ‘‘window study’’ can be performed safely. It is likely
that many similar preoperative trial designs will be utilized
in future studies of DCIS. Missing an occult invasive
malignancy is of concern, and it is anticipated that more
stringent DCIS size eligibility criteria and the use of
potentially better imaging will markedly decrease the risk
of missing a concurrent occult invasive component.
Finally, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project (NSABP) is studying the potential efficacy
and role of postoperative trastuzumab for DCIS in a phase
3 randomized trial for patients with DCIS treated with
breast conservation surgery. Patients are being randomized to 6 weeks of whole-breast irradiation with or without concurrent trastuzumab, given in 2 doses at week 1
and 3. The rationale for using trastuzumab concurrently
with radiation for HER2-overexpressing DCIS is that
trastuzumab only radiosensitizes cells that overexpress
HER2, and therefore will enhance the radiation sensitivity
of carcinoma more than surrounding healthy tissues. The
results of this study provide no evidence that trastuzumab

utilized with radiation will or will not be effective. Furthermore, the NSABP study is also designed to evaluate
the long-term potential effects of trastuzumab on the prevention of contralateral breast cancer.
In summary, this phase 2, open-label clinical trial
using a single dose of intravenous trastuzumab for patients
with HER2-positive DCIS did not result in significant,
clinically overt histologic, anti-proliferative, or apoptotic
changes, but did result in the specific ability of treated
patients to mount ADCC mediated through NK cells and
induce humoral immunity in a T-cell-dependent manner
in 1 patient. These findings warrant additional studies to
determine whether these short-term immune responses
may prove useful in the prevention of recurrent or contralateral breast cancer.
