BACKGROUND: Despite evidence supporting perioperative chemotherapy, few randomized studies compare neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer. Consequently, the standard of care regarding the timing of
chemotherapy for locally advanced bladder cancer remains controversial. We compared patient outcomes following
neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for cT2-T4aN0-N2M0 bladder cancer. METHODS: In a retrospective
review of a single institutional database from 1988 through 2009, we identified patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant multiagent platinum-based systemic chemotherapy for locally advanced bladder cancer. Survival analysis was
performed comparing disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 146 patients
received systemic perioperative chemotherapy (73 neoadjuvant, 73 adjuvant). Of these, 84% (122/146) received cisplatin-based chemotherapy compared with carboplatin-based chemotherapy (24/146, 16.4%). Most patients receiving
cisplatin-based chemotherapy were treated with methotrexate/vinblastine/adriamycin/cisplatin (79/122, 64.8%),
whereas the remaining patients received gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) (43/122, 35.2%). In multivariable analysis, there
was no significant difference in DSS (P ¼ .46) or OS (P ¼ .76) between neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy
groups. There was statistically significant improvement in DSS when patients received neoadjuvant GC rather than
adjuvant GC (P ¼ .049, hazard ratio, 10.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-112.2). CONCLUSION: In this study, there was
no statistically significant difference in OS and DSS between patients receiving neoadjuvant versus adjuvant systemic
platinum-based chemotherapy for locally advanced bladder cancer. In addition, there was no significant difference
between neoadjuvant and adjuvant cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. Chemotherapy sequence relative
to surgery appeared less important than whether or not a patient actually received perioperative chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION
In 2009, 70,980 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed, and 14,330 patients died secondary to bladder cancer in the
United States.1 Although the majority of patients are diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and
experience a favorable outcome, many patients with locally advanced bladder cancer ultimately succumb to metastatic disease with a 5-year overall survival rate after radical cystectomy ranging from 36%-48%.2-5 Systemic chemotherapy either
before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) local extirpative therapy can be used as an adjunct to surgery. The rationale for
neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to potentially eradicate the primary lesion and to treat micrometastatic foci of disease before
the patient is debilitated by a major surgical procedure. The disadvantage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the delay in definitive surgical therapy, especially in patients who are clinically understaged or may respond suboptimally to chemotherapy. The rationale for adjuvant chemotherapy is to reduce the incidence of local and metastatic recurrence in patients with
locally advanced disease. Although prognostic stratification may be improved based on pathologic staging, one possible

disadvantage of adjuvant chemotherapy is the potential
delay in systemic treatment for patients recovering from
cystectomy and possible postoperative complications.
Several studies have demonstrated that the integration of either neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy is
associated with a survival advantage. Both the Nordic
Cystectomy I trial and the United States Intergroup trial
(SWOG 8710) demonstrated improved overall survival in
patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.6-8 Trials published by Stockle et al.9 and Skinner et al.10 have
demonstrated a significant decrease in rates of progression
among patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. In
addition, a recent multicenter retrospective study demonstrated that off-protocol adjuvant systemic chemotherapy
was independently associated with improved survival,
especially among higher-risk subgroups.11 Despite evidence supporting perioperative chemotherapy, there is a
paucity of randomized controlled trials comparing neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy; therefore, the standard of care regarding the sequence of chemotherapy
relative to surgery for the treatment of advanced bladder
cancer remains controversial. Given the limited data available in the literature, we sought to compare the clinical
outcomes of patients receiving either neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy at the time of radical cystectomy at our institution.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
The institutional review board
approved bladder cancer
outcomes database was reviewed to identify patients who
received either cisplatin-based or carboplatin-based chemotherapy between January 1988 and July 2009. All
patients had cT2-T4aN0-N2M0 transitional cell carcinoma according to the 2010 American Joint Committee
on Cancer tumor
node
metastasis staging scheme.12
All patients with known metastatic disease at the initiation
of induction or salvage chemotherapy were excluded from
analysis. Patients with pathologically confirmed lymph
node metastases at the time of cystectomy receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were included in the study. Each
patient included in the final dataset had received multiagent systemic chemotherapy.13 Each patient also underwent extirpative therapy with radical cystectomy and
pelvic lymph node dissection, except for 13 patients that
refused cystectomy after clinical T0 response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (data not shown). For the purposes of
this study, adjuvant chemotherapy was defined as systemic
chemotherapy received in the postoperative period within
6 months of surgery.

Figure 1. Consort diagram shows the study cohort of 146
patients receiving systemic chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer.

The primary endpoints analyzed were disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). Preoperatively, patients were evaluated via physical examination,
endoscopic evaluation, laboratory studies, chest radiographs, and cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen and
pelvis. Postoperatively, patients were followed with routine laboratory studies, physical examinations, and interval cross-sectional imaging. Additional radiographic and
diagnostic tests were performed at the discretion of the
attending physician. Length of follow-up and start of survival analysis was determined from date of cystectomy to
time of death or last follow-up. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method with patients
stratified into neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy and
adjuvant systemic chemotherapy cohorts. Univariable and
multivariable analysis were used to determine significant
predictors of DSS and OS. Multivariable analysis was
controlled for age, grade, stage, chemotherapy type, and
intent, and additionally for race, sex, and smoking history
in a second model. Furthermore, a subset analysis was performed for patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy based on their regimen. All analyses were
performed using a ¼ .05 to determine statistical significance. Statistical functions were performed using Stata 11
(College Station, Texas).

RESULTS
A total of 687 patients underwent radical cystectomy at
our institution between January 1988 and July 2009 (Figure 1). After all patients with known metastatic disease

were excluded, our final dataset was comprised of 146
patients with cT2-T4aN0-2M0 bladder cancer who
received either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (73/146, 50%)
or adjuvant chemotherapy (73/146, 50%). Complete
response rate after neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy
was 31.5% (26/73). This finding represents a systemic
chemotherapy use rate of 146/687 (21%). Among the
687 patients undergoing cystectomy, 180 (26%) had
recurrent NMIBC and 80 (12%) had non
transitional
cell carcinoma (TCC) histology. One patient with adenocarcinoma and 1 patient with squamous cell carcinoma
received systemic chemotherapy. After excluding all
patients with NMIBC and non-TCC histology, the percentage of patients with muscle-invasive or more
advanced bladder receiving systemic chemotherapy perioperatively was 21% (144/687).
Clinical characteristics of the cohort are presented in
Table 1. Among the group receiving perioperative chemotherapy, 105 were men (52 neoadjuvant, 53 adjuvant)
and 41 were women (21 neoadjuvant, 20 adjuvant). The
median age was 65 years (range, 36-83 years). The majority of patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy
(122/146, 83.6%) compared with carboplatin-based
chemotherapy (24/146, 16.4%) (Table 2). The majority
of patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy
were treated with methotrexate/vinblastine/adriamycin/
cisplatin (MVAC) (79/122, 64.8%), whereas the remaining patients were treated with gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC)
(43/122, 35.2%). The distribution between neoadjuvant
and adjuvant chemotherapy was relatively equal in the cisplatin-based group, with 62/122 patients (50.8%) and

who received adjuvant chemotherapy (median survival,
12.5 months) on univariable analysis. Both univariable and
multivariable analysis demonstrated no significant difference in DSS (P ¼ .555) or OS (P ¼ .573) when patients
who received neoadjuvant MVAC (median survival, 16
months) were compared with patients who received adjuvant MVAC (median survival, 22 months).
When patients who received neoadjuvant GC (median survival 11 months) were compared with patients who
received adjuvant GC (median survival, 10.5 months), there
was no significant difference in OS in both univariable and
multivariable (P ¼ .607) analyses. On multivariable analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in DSS
when patients received neoadjuvant GC rather than adjuvant GC (P ¼ .049, HR 10.6, CI 1.01-112.2). Similar to
the cisplatin-based chemotherapy group, there was no difference in DSS (P ¼ .764) or OS (P ¼ .388) using either
univariable or multivariable analyses when comparing
patients receiving neoadjuvant carboplatin-based chemotherapy (median survival, 8.9 months) with patients receiving adjuvant carboplatin-based chemotherapy (median
survival, 10 months). Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen, however, was a significant independent predictor of
improved OS (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18-0.60; P.001) and
DSS (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13-0.51; P.001).

DISCUSSION
The integration of systemic chemotherapy with surgical
treatment for locally advanced bladder cancer is not a
novel concept. In 1988, Logothetis et al.14 reported that
patients with pathologically proven extravesical disease
had better survival when they received adjuvant chemotherapy after radical cystectomy. Although the literature
contains studies that show no significant survival advantage associated with the administration of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, several studies have clearly demonstrated
the benefit of neoadjuvant regimens. The Nordic Cystectomy I trial included 325 patients that were randomized
to local radiation therapy and radical cystectomy with or
without neoadjuvant cisplatin and adriamycin.6 The
study did not demonstrate a significant difference but did
report improved 5-year OS when the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (59%) was compared with the group that
did not receive chemotherapy (51%, P ¼ .10), despite
lack of methotrexate and vinblastine. In addition, there
was a 15% improvement in OS (P ¼ .03) when the survival analysis was limited to only patients with stage T3T4a disease. The survival advantage associated with neo-

362

adjuvant chemotherapy was confirmed in a more recent
follow-up study.15 More recently, the United States Intergroup trial (SWOG 8710) reported on 307 patients with
clinical T2-T4N0M0 bladder cancer randomly assigned
to radical cystectomy with or without 3 cycles of neoadjuvant MVAC. Despite a lack of statistical significance, the
study demonstrated a dramatic improvement in overall
median survival from 46 months in the surgery alone
group to 77 months in the group that received neoadjuvant MVAC (P ¼ .06) with a 14% improvement in overall 5-year survival.7 In addition, the pT0 rate at the time
of cystectomy among those receiving neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy was significantly higher (38%) than
the cystectomy alone group (15%).
The literature also provides sufficient support for the
use of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with locally
advanced disease and/or nodal involvement. Skinner et al.10
reported 87 patients who were randomized to radical cystectomy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, mainly in
the form of cisplatin/cyclophosphamide/adriamycin. Despite the lack of methotrexate and vinblastine, the study
demonstrated significant improvement in median progression-free survival from 2.4 years in the surgery alone group
to 4.3 years in the group that received adjuvant chemotherapy (P ¼ .006). Although there was no statistically significant difference in the 5-year OS when patients received
adjuvant chemotherapy, there was a nonstatistically significant improvement from 39% to 44%. Shortly after Skinner
et al. reported their results, Stockle et al.9 published a series
of 83 patients that were randomized to radical cystectomy
with or without adjuvant MVAC or methotrexate/vinblastine/epirubicin/cisplatin. The trial was stopped before completion of patient accrual when an interim data analysis
revealed a significant improvement in 5-year progressionfree survival from 13% in the surgery alone group to 59%
in the adjuvant chemotherapy group. The results of this
study are confounded, however, because patients randomized to receive no adjuvant chemotherapy did not receive
any chemotherapy even upon relapse. More recently, PazAres et al.16 conducted a randomized phase III clinical trial
(SOGUG 99/01) comparing adjuvant paclitaxel/gemcitabine/cisplatin (PGC) (68 patients) with observation (74
patients) following resection of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (pT3-4 and/or pNþ). At a median follow-up of 30
months, OS was significantly prolonged in the PGC arm
(median, not reported; 5-year OS, 60%) compared with observation (median, 26 months; 5-year OS, 31%)
(P<.0009). Disease-free survival (P<.0001), time to progression (P<.0001), and DSS (P<.0002) were also superior

in the PGC arm. Because the study was closed prematurely
due to poor accrual, definitive conclusions are limited. In
addition, a recent study of 932 patients receiving off-protocol adjuvant systemic chemotherapy identified adjuvant
therapy to be independently associated with improved survival (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.97; P ¼ .017). The
advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy was most pronounced
in the highest-risk patient group with advanced pathologic
stage and lymph node involvement.11
Although there is compelling evidence to support
the use of either neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy
for patients with locally advanced bladder cancer, the
question of sequence of perioperative chemotherapy
remains controversial. To our knowledge, no prospective
study has directly compared a full course of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy to a full course of adjuvant treatment. Despite the lack of direct comparison studies, the literature
does provide some clues as to the optimal sequence of perioperative chemotherapy in relation to cystectomy. Millikan et al.17 evaluated 140 patients at the University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who were randomized to radical cystectomy with either 5 cycles of adjuvant
MVAC or 2 cycles of neoadjuvant MVAC with 3 cycles of
adjuvant MVAC. With a median follow-up of 6.8 years,
the study demonstrated no significant difference in DSS
or OS. Based on these results, the importance of simply
receiving perioperative chemotherapy appears to outweigh the specific sequence of the adjunct treatment.
The results from the current study confirm that there
is no statistically significant difference detectable between
neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in
advanced bladder cancer in terms of OS and DSS in our
cohort. In subset analysis, there was no significant difference
between neoadjuvant and adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy or neoadjuvant and adjuvant carboplatin-based
chemotherapy. It should be noted that perioperative carboplatin-based regimens were used in a small number of
patients, and this is not standard practice.18 In further analysis of the cisplatin group, there was no difference in OS or
DSS when MVAC chemotherapy was given in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings. This lack of significant impact
held true even when controlling for any pathologic differences in the groups receiving adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy. With GC therapy, however, there was a significant
difference with adjuvant systemic therapy associated with
decreased DSS (HR, 10.6; 95% CI, 1.01-112.2; P ¼ .049)
compared with neoadjuvant therapy. This difference of
DSS between neoadjuvant and adjuvant GC use may be
confounded, because patients receiving GC chemotherapy

likely had worse prechemotherapy characteristics (including
decreased performance status) than those selected for
MVAC therapy. This may have affected tolerability of surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent survival.
These findings must be confirmed with additional clinical
trials accounting for preoperative clinical characteristics and
chemotherapy selection.
Despite evidence to support the use of perioperative
chemotherapy, a multimodal treatment plan is often underused. A review of 7161 patients from the National Cancer
Database revealed that only 11.6% of patients with stage 3
bladder cancer were treated with perioperative chemotherapy from 1998 to 2003.19 The same study also demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy was more commonly
used in 10.4% of patients, compared with 2.2% for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our rate of use was 21%, which likely
reflects the tertiary academic nature of our medical center,
and we had an equal distribution between neoadjuvant and
adjuvant chemotherapy. Urologists and patients may be
more inclined to pursue adjuvant chemotherapy in an effort
to avoid a delay in surgical treatment, especially with the
decreased morbidity of radical cystectomy and improvement in quality of life afforded by orthotopic bladder substitutions. Some urologists may also avoid neoadjuvant
treatment due to a concern that preoperative chemotherapy
may increase the technical difficulty of a radical cystectomy.
However, the study by Millikan et al.17 reported no increase
in perioperative morbidity after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
With the future advent of molecular markers that may predict chemotherapy response of bladder cancer patients, perhaps the nationwide rates of use for perioperative
chemotherapy will increase.
Our study had several limitations. We were confined
by the retrospective nature of our study and therefore are
exposed to potential biases in the 2 treatment groups. However, in the absence of a prospective randomized trial, this
level of evidence may be the only source of information to
help guide clinician decision-making. In an effort to control
for any differences in risk between the adjuvant and neoadjuvant groups, a multivariable logistic regression model was
developed that did not indicate sequence of therapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) as a significant factor in outcome. Our
observations were also limited to a single tertiary-care center
experience. Based on the retrospective nature of the study,
we were forced to draw conclusions from a heterogeneous
patient population that received a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens that may have differing efficacy. In addition, comorbidity information and preoperative
performance status were not available for our cohort.

Furthermore, disease recurrence may not be captured effectively without a prospective trial with a specified follow-up protocol. There is potential error in
discussing DSS or disease-free survival rates in a nontrial
population. We have attempted to counter this potential
issue by obtaining our survival data from the Social Security Death Index in addition to our clinical records. We
followed rigid criteria when determining death from bladder cancer, and there was no difference in the outcome
determination between neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment arms. Thus, any inherent inaccuracy secondary to
the retrospective nature of this study would be equivalent
in both study groups. In addition, median follow-up was
shorter than potential follow-up, because more than 60%
of patients were treated since 2002, and some patients
were lost to follow-up.
Despite these limitations, we feel the present study
provides valuable information for clinicians counseling
patients with locally advanced bladder cancer in the perioperative setting. Ultimately, a prospective trial ideally
designed as a noninferiority trial would be useful, but
would require a large patient cohort to determine outcome differences between chemotherapy sequences. Furthermore, it would require a dedicated staff to uphold
rigorous inclusion criteria of clinical staging for the neoadjuvant study group and pathologic staging for the adjuvant study group. In addition, the consequences of
alternative chemotherapy regimens, including high-dose
intensity MVAC, gemcitabine with taxane chemotherapy,
and predictive molecular markers should be studied further within the context of chemotherapy sequence.
Conclusion
In this study, neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not demonstrate a significant difference when compared with adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of OS and DSS for both
cisplatin-based and carboplatin-based regimens. Completed randomized clinical trials such as SWOG 8710
suggest that chemotherapy offers a survival advantage to
patients in the perioperative setting. The current study
suggests that the sequence of such chemotherapy is less
important than whether or not a patient actually receives
perioperative chemotherapy. The findings of this study
should be considered when counseling patients regarding
the sequence of perioperative chemotherapy and should
be validated with a prospective randomized trial.
