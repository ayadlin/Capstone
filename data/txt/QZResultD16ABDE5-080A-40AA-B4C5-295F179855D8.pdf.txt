ABSTRACT:
Nausea is a prominent symptom and major cause of complaint for patients
receiving anticancer chemo- or radiation therapy. The arsenal of anti-nausea
drugs is limited, and their efficacy is questionable. Currently, the development of
new compounds with anti-nausea activity is hampered by the lack of physiological
correlates of nausea. Physiological correlates are needed because common laboratory
rodents lack the vomiting reflex. Furthermore, nausea does not always lead to
vomiting. Here, we report the results of studies conducted in four research centers
to investigate whether nausea is associated with any specific thermoregulatory
symptoms. Two species were studied: the laboratory rat, which has no vomiting
reflex, and the house musk shrew (Suncus murinus), which does have a vomiting
reflex. In rats, motion sickness was induced by rotating them in their individual cages
in the horizontal plane (0.75 Hz, 40 min) and confirmed by reduced food consumption
at the onset of dark (active) phase. In 100% of rats tested at three centers, postrotational sickness was associated with marked (~1.5°C) hypothermia, which was
associated with a short-lasting tail-skin vasodilation (skin temperature increased
by ~4°C). Pretreatment with ondansetron, a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist,
which is used to treat nausea in patients in chemo- or radiation therapy, attenuated
hypothermia by ~30%. In shrews, motion sickness was induced by a cyclical backand-forth motion (4 cm, 1 Hz, 15 min) and confirmed by the presence of retching
and vomiting. In this model, sickness was also accompanied by marked hypothermia
(~2°C). Like in rats, the hypothermic response was preceded by transient tail-skin
vasodilation. In conclusion, motion sickness is accompanied by hypothermia that
involves both autonomic and thermoeffector mechanisms: tail-skin vasodilation
and possibly reduction of the interscapular brown adipose tissue activity. These
thermoregulatory symptoms may serve as physiological correlates of nausea.

INTRODUCTION

either due to cancer itself or secondary to chemotherapy

(eg. cyclophosphamide and cisplatin) possess potent
emetogenic properties [2]. Nausea and vomiting produced

by these and other chemothrerapeutic drugs are among the
most severe and feared collateral effects of chemotherapy
[3, 4]. These side effects not only dramatically worsen
quality of life, but may affect the patients’ willingness to
continue their anti-cancer treatment. Of interest, nausea
has a stronger negative impact on patients’ daily life than
vomiting [5].
The introduction of the 5-HT3 and neurokinin-1
(NK1) antagonists substantially improved the management
of chemotherapy-induced vomiting [2, 4]. However,
paradoxically, their effect on nausea was comparatively
modest [6, 7], and it is now becoming recognized that
nausea and vomiting represent totally different entities,
both from the point of view of their pathophysiology
and pharmacotherapy [8, 9]. The relative potencies of
anti-emetic drugs to differentially reduce nausea and
emesis were not immediately recognized as nausea was
only a secondary end-point in most clinical studies.
Likewise, most recent pre-clinical studies of novel antiemetic substances are based on emetic responses, and it
is assumed that drugs which suppress retching/vomiting
in animals may be equally good in suppressing nausea
in humans. As noted, this is not the case. The situation
is even more complicated in ‘nausea’ studies performed
in common laboratory animals such as rats and mice,
as these animal do not have emetic reflex. Here, a
researcher’s choice for assessing nausea is limited to
just a few biological indices with either poor temporal
resolution (e.g. reduced locomotion or food intake) or
questionable face validity (e.g. pica - kaolin consumption)
and specificity (eg. conditioned food aversion) (reviewed
in [8]).
This differential action of anti-emetic drugs on
nausea and emesis in the clinic led to the realization that
there may be different pathways and control systems for
nausea and vomiting [8]. Furthermore, it is now clear
that the wealth of existing mechanistic knowledge on
the neural mechanism of the vomiting reflex, with its
circuitry located mainly in the brainstem [8, 10], is not
directly applicable to nausea – a subjective experience
that presumably originates in some forebrain areas.
Consequently, identification of the key transmitter systems
and receptors involved in nausea perception is essential for
the improved care of the cancer patients. Providing that
major methodological obstacle for advancing in this field
is lack of adequate animal models for studying nausea [11],
development and validation of new potential physiological
indices for such studies is of major importance.
In humans, nausea is commonly associated with
facial pallor, sweating and gastric awareness [8]. It is less
known, but well documented that in humans nausea is also
associated with profound disturbances in thermoregulation,
including falls in the core body temperature, modified
perception of the ambient temperature and preference
for cooler environment [12-15]. It is currently unknown
whether pro-emetic stimulation elicits similar disturbances
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in experimental animals, and we have designed our
experiments to elucidate this question. Neither subjective
perceptions nor sweating can be assessed in conscious
rodents. On the other hand, core body temperature,
cutaneous temperature, and the preference for ambient
temperature are readily measurable, but none have ever
been used in preclinical studies of nausea. Our principal
hypothesis was that pro-emetic stimulation causes
hypothermia and alters behavioral preference for the
ambient temperature in rodents.

RESULTS
Provocative motion reduced food consumption in
rats.
Provocative motion had substantial and significant
anorexic effect (Fig. 1): during 30-min test period, rats
subjected to rotation consumed 42% less food compared to
controls (1.4±0.1 vs. 2.5±0.3g, respectively; p<0.05); this
effect was even larger (49%, or 0.43±0.02 vs. 0.84±0.05 g,
respectively; p<0.05) if food consumption was assessed as
a percentage of increase in body weight. In contrast, there
was no effect of rotation on water consumption (2.6±0.3
vs. 2.7±0.3, or 0.85±0.03 vs. 0.85±0.05%, respectively;
p>0.05 for both).

Provocative motion caused hypothermia in rats.
During the initial (basal) thermogradient session,
there was no difference in basal core body temperature
between animals exposed to provocative motion and
controls. In all tested rats, rotation caused consistent falls
in the core body temperature (Fig. 2A). These falls became
apparent within the first 5-7 min of rotation, and did not

Following return to the thermogradient, core body
temperature returned to the basal level within 30 min. In
contrast to hypothermic responses elicited by provocative

motion, we observed rises in core body temperature
in rats returned to their home cages after the initial
thermogradient session. Their temperature started to fall
after reaching peak, but slightly increased again following

shown in Fig. 5A, with data values presented near the

onset within 1 min of stimulation and with peak at 172±12
s (range 120-240 s). These effects were observed in six of
seven animals tested; of note, the non-responder had lower
values of basal interscapular, lumbar and tail temperature
(36.2, 33.6 and 20.2°C, respectively) compared to five
other shrews. An example of infrared images obtained in
one shrew before and 6 min after the onset of rotation are
presented in Fig. 5B and C.

Analysis of infrared images revealed that within 10
minutes from the onset of rotation, tail temperature started
to rise, reached peak at about 20 min, and then gradually
returned to the baseline (Fig. 3A). Ondansetron had no
effect on the amplitude of tail warming (p>0.05). In the
control experiment (without rotation), neither Ringer nor
ondansetron affected tail temperature (Fig. 3B). Mean data
values are also presented in Fig. 3. An example of infrared
images obtained in one rat before and 20 min after the
onset of rotation are presented in Fig. 3C and D.

DISCUSSION
Our major novel finding is that in rats, provocative
motion causes anorexic effect indicative of nausea state
associated with a rapid and robust fall in the core body
temperature; and that this latter effect is mediated, at
least in part, by vasodilatation in the thermoregulatory
tail vascular bed. This finding was confirmed in the musk
shrew, where tail vasodilation preceded the first vomiting
episode, when animals likely experienced nausea. Our
observations mirror thermoregulatory changes reported
in humans during nausea [12-15]. Together, they form
the basis for a new concept – that disturbances in
thermoregulation is a core element in the pathophysiology
of nausea. Indeed, looking from this angle at the symptoms
that accompany nausea in humans, one would immediately
realize that they form a “thermoregulatory cluster”. Firstly,
and somewhat surprisingly, nausea-related sweating
has never been considered as an indication of altered
temperature control; meanwhile, it is known that nausea
does trigger not only “stress-related” palmar sweating,
but also thermoregulatory sweating on the dorsum of
the hand [16]. Secondly, it is now documented that in
humans experiencing nausea, subjective perception of
the ambient temperature as well as subjective preference
for it are altered [13]. Lastly, as it was earlier found in
humans [12, 14, 15], and as we now report in two different
mammalian species, pro-emetic stimuli appear to suppress
cold defence, by causing cutaneous vasodilatation leading
to heat dissipation and fall in the core body temperature.

Ondansetron attenuates hypothermic responses to
provocative motion in rats.
In this group of rats (n=9), provocative motion
elicited hypothermic responses that were quantitatively
and qualitatively similar to those reported in Exp. 2 above.
Pre-treatment with ondansetron partially but significantly
reduced this rotation-induced hypothermia (Fig. 4A), with
the value of temperature fall post-drug (-1.3±0.2°C) being
smaller compared to the post-vehicle value (-1.8±0.2°C;
p<0.05). Ondansetron alone did not have any effect on the
core body temperature (Fig. 4B).

Our initial intention was to record core body
temperature in shrews by means of biotelemetry, similar
to the rat study. Unfortunately it appeared that shrews did
not tolerate intraperitonial implantation of the transmitters,
resulting in high mortality. For this reason we report
here only effects of provocative motion on the surface
temperature. Similar to previous reports, motion stimuli
caused repetitive retching/vomiting episodes in all tested
animals (n=7). The mean number of these episodes was
5.7±0.7 (range 4-8 in 15 min), with a mean latency of
195±41 s (range 90-380 s). Analysis of infrared images
revealed consistent and substantial reduction in the
cutaneous temperature in the interscapular and lumbar
areas during provocative motion; this was preceded by a
transient increase in the tail temperature that subsequently
fell below the basal level. Of note, the difference between
the interscapular and the lumbar temperatures tended

Choice of the pro-emetic intervention.
It is well established that sensitivity to
chemotherapy-induced nausea is higher in those patients
who are also susceptible to motion sickness and/or
with a history of nausea during pregnancy [17, 18].
This suggests that sensitivity to nausea is determined at
integrative centers in the brain receiving different inputs.
In turn, this allows measuring the sensitivity to one type
of emetic stimuli to assess sensitivity to another. This
is of major importance for our study as the most direct
approach here would be to subject the experimental
1569

animals to chemotherapeutic agents only. However, the
multiple biological actions of these drugs (e.g. involving
gross damage to tissues) and the complexity of relevant
pathways (e.g. both peripheral nerve input and input
from the area postrema) renders great difficulty in tracing
causative links between their initial sites of action and
our end-point measurements. For this reason, we induced
a ‘nausea-like’ state by provocative motion – a “clean”
stimulus, acting through well characterized vestibular
pathways, and not involving biochemical effects of
chemotherapy. Providing that nausea-related effects of
chemotherapy are long-lasting (days), relatively fast
recovery from provocative motion is another obvious
advantage in addressing mechanisms of nausea.

with an increase in the tail blood flow.
Similarity between temperature changes elicited by
provocative motion in humans, rats and shrews suggests
that these mammalian species possibly possess similar
neural mechanisms linking nausea to thermoregulation.
Consequently, thermoregulatory disturbances may not
only be considered as a key accompanying symptom
of nausea, but in fact could be used as a valuable
physiological correlate of this disorder in experimental
animals. This is supported by our finding that falls in body
temperature preceded retching/vomiting in shrews: this
means that if they experienced sensation akin to nausea
prior to these episodes, it was associated with altered
temperature control. Of course our proposal requires
further validation, in first instance by testing whether
observed effects on the temperature are sensitive to drugs
used to treat nausea. In the current study, we started this
validation from ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist
with proven antiemetic potency [29]. The drug only
moderately attenuated motion-induced hypothermia in
our rats. It is unlikely that this poor effect was due to the
low dose as we have used a dosage validated in other
in vivo bioassays [30]. Rather, if hypothermia reflects a
nausea-like state as we suggest, such a poor effect should
be expected, providing a recognized dissociation between
anti-nausea and antiemetic potency of the drug in humans
[29]. Our control experiments (without rotation) confirmed
that ondansetron alone does not have any effect on the
core body temperature or on the tail temperature. The
former observation is in accord with the earlier studies that
address this issue [31, 32].
Our negative thermogradient data indicate that
contrarily to humans, pro-emetic stimulation does not
change rats’ preference for the ambient temperature. The
reason of this discrepancy is currently unknown, as our
thermogradient methodology is highly sensitive and well
validated [33]. It may be that in rats the change in the
ambient temperature preference does occur, but quickly
restores after termination of the stimulus. Presentation of
pro-emetic stimuli in the thermogradient may clarify this
issue in future experiments.

Body core and tail temperature as a new
physiological correlate of nausea in animals.
Provocative motion has been used previously to
examine signs of motion sickness in both musk shrews and
rats. In shrews, motion stimuli reliably provoked retching
and vomiting [19, 20], similarly to our observation. With
the exception of a single article that describes motioninduced alterations in gastric myeloelectric activity [21],
all other studies conducted on shrews did not quantify any
other indices except emetic episodes. Our work is thus the
first to report motion-induced temperature-based effects
in this species. Since in humans nausea usually precedes
vomiting, we consider the fact that thermoregulatory
changes preceded vomiting/retching episodes in shrews
as an indirect evidence for a nausea-like state in these
animals.
Reduced food consumption following provocative
motion has been reported previously in rats [22], and our
results are in accord with these earlier data. However,
most provocative motion studies conducted in rats
were focussed on quantifying pica – an unconventional
consumption of kaolin (eg. [23, 24]. While having some
predictive validity, this approach has relatively low
temporal resolution; morepver, nausea-related pica is
absent not only in humans but also in musk shrews and
mice [25, 26]. In addition to pica, in rats provocative
motion reduces locomotor activity [27] and provokes
conditioned taste aversion [28]. There is only one
study where the effect of provocative motion on body
temperature was examined in rats: Ossenkopp at al.
[27] reported that rectal temperature fell by about 20C in
animals subjected to horizontal rotation (70 rpm for 30min). Our work not only reconfirms these earlier finding
but also takes it further, by: i) non-invasive measurement
of core temperature that eliminate the confounding of
the stress response elicited by rectal measurement; ii)
providing a real-time temporal course of the temperature
fall; and iii) demonstrating that hypothermia is associated

motion-induced

A rise in the tail temperature was associated with
falls in body temperature in both rats and shrews. This
suggests that in both species, dilatation of the tail vascular
bed represented the mechanism underlying heat loss
and leading to hypothermia. It appears however that
this was not the sole cause of hypothermia observed
in our experiments. Lack of ondansetron effect on the
motion-induced rise in the tail temperature suggests that
the anti-hypothermic action of the drug was not due to

1570

preventing tail vasodilation. In rodents, temperature
balance is achieved by coordinated regulation of heat loss
via cutaneous blood vessels and heat generation by the
brown adipose tissue (BAT) (see [34, 35] for reviews). It
is thus possible that motion-induced hypothermia was a
result of two synergistic effects - increase in the tail blood
flow (i.e. increased heat dissipation) and reduction in the
BAT thermogenesis, and that ondansetron affected only
the latter. The idea of downregulation of the BAT activity
by provocative motion is supported, at least in shrews,
by observation that not only did the provocative motion
reduce interscapular and lumbar skin temperatures, but it
also tended to reduce the temperature difference between
these two regions, which is indicative of reduced BAT
thermogenesis [36].
 Our earlier analysis of thermoeffector threshold
data [37] suggests that deep hypothermic responses
(such as the ones reported here) occur primarily due to
a drastic decrease in the threshold body temperature for
BAT thermogenesis (with a much smaller and inconsistent
reduction in the threshold temperature for skin
vasodilation), thus leading to poikilothermy. The latter, in
turn, results in hypothermia – if the ambient temperature is
low enough.  The best studied response of this type is LPSinduced hypothermia [36]. Since bacterial endotoxemia
is frequently associated with nausea and vomiting (e.g.
[38, 39]), it is tempting to suggest that LPS hypothermia
and hypothermia induced by pro-emetic stimulation
may involve similar mechanisms. It would thus be most
interesting to determine the effect of provocative motion
on thermoeffector thresholds.

responsible for motion sickness could interfere with
the descending thermoregulatory control. Changes
in subjective perception of ambient temperature and
preference for a cooler environment, commonly known
and recently documented effects of motion sickness in
humans [13], suggest that this interference occurs quite
high in the neuraxis, potentially in the preoptic anrerior
hypothalamus.
Knowledge about the pathways controlling tail
vascular tone and BAT does not bring any clarity in the
question why ondansetron had differential effects on
these two thermoeffectors. There is currently no data
on involvement of 5-HT3 signalling in either of these
pathways. There is however an additional possibility
as it is known that provocative motion, similar to other
emetic stimuli, reduces locomotion in rats [27]. If
ondansetron in our study attenuated this effect, it could
be that locomotion-generated heat resulted in reduced
hypothermia during motion stimulation in animals
treated with the drug. Unfortunately telemetric signal for
locomotion cannot be recorded during rotation, and we are
unable to confirm or disapprove this possibility.
The most challenging task of our discussion is
to provide suggestions about the site of origin of the
final neural input that provokes perturbations in the
thermoregulatory control. Currently, the dominating
theory of motion sickness is the one of sensory conflict;
it postulates that when converging vesibular, visual and
proprioceptive input patterns differ from the expected
sensory pattern stored in memory, spatial orientation is
disturbed, and this leads to motion sickness [40]. Until
recently, there was no direct data regarding potential
anatomical location of neurons generating “sensory
mismatch” signal. In an elegant studies conducted in
rats [41] demonstrated that this might happen in the
hippocampus, whose role in spatial orientation and
learning is well recognized. The first human brain imaging
study of motion sickness revealed several regions that
were activated during the experience of nausea, namely
the medial prefrontal cortex, the insular cortex, the
amygdala, the putamen and the locus coeruleus [42];
somewhat surprisingly, hippocampus was not among
them. Clearly, cited works provide a good framework for
future experimental determination of motion sicknessactivated inputs to thermoregulatory pathways.

Neural pathways mediating hypothermia elicited
by the provocative motion.
Rotation stimuli used in the present work caused
alterations in vestibular and possibly visual sensory inputs,
and there must be some area within the brain where this
sensory information was converted into the command
signals targeting thermoeffectors. Location of central
command neurons and efferent pathways controlling
thermoeffectors is relatively well understood, at least
in rats [34, 35]. Information from central (brain) and
peripheral thermosensors is integrated in the preoptic
anterior hypothalamus that sends excitatory projection
to the dorsomedial hypothalamus, a major integrative
centre for autonomic output. Descending presympathetic
pathways from the DMH relay in the periaqueductal
grey and then in the medullary raphe/parapyramidal
area and in the spinal cord, where separate populations
of sympathetic neurones control two thermoeffectors
– brown adipose tissue responsible for non-shivering
thermogenesis and cutaneous vascular bed responsible for
heat dissipation/conservation. It is thus clear that there is a
limited number of neural targets where neural mechanisms

Physiological significance and perspectives.
Provocative motion could be considered as a
stressful intervention, and in this context hypothermia
caused by it seems paradoxical providing all other
stressors (restraint, social interaction, novelty, footshocks
etc.) provoke hyperthermic responses in rodents.
Ossenkopp [27] presented an interesting explanation of
this apparent paradox. Based on the idea that lowing body
temperature could represent a defence mechanism against
1571

Oncotarget

intoxication and on the Treisman’s theory that aversive
sensation of nausea which accompanies motion sickness
is a by-product of evolutionary developed defence against
ingested neurotoxins [43], authors postulated that motion
sickness-induced hypothermia is a manifestation of this
evolutionary beneficial reaction. Its high evolutionary
relevance might explain the fact that provocative motion
not only led to a fall in the abdominal temperature
compared to baseline, but in addition counteracted
hyperthermic responses provoked by animal handling
(Fig. 2A).
As we stated in the Introduction, the major obstacle
in preclinical studies of nausea is the lack of ability to
assess its cardinal symptoms (subjective experience and
sweating) in experimental animals. The only established
biochemical marker of nausea in humans, elevated plasma
vasopressin [44, 45], has been confirmed in cats [46] and
ferrets [47] but not in rats [44, 48]. Consequently, rodent
studies of motion sickness-induced nausea have to rely
on indirect indices, often with poor temporal resolution
(eg. locomotor activity, food consumption) or limited
face validity (eg. pica that, in addition, is species specific
[25, 26]). Quantifying retching or vomiting in species
possessing emetic reflex (eg. shrews) now appears not to
be an ideal solution for nausea studies as here the major
difficulty is in the totally different neural substrates
responsible for nausea and for vomiting. It is most likely
that relying on emetic responses in preclinical studies
is the major reason for pharmacological dissociation of
current anti-emetics that efficiently suppress vomiting but
are less potent in preventing nausea [9, 29].
We believe that our current findings, in combination
with the solid evidence obtained in humans and discussed
above, represent a firm basis for the claim that altered
thermoregulation is a core pathophysiological element of
nausea in mammals. Consequently, assessing temperaturerelated indices in experimental animals subjected to proemetic stimuli, including chemotherapeutic agents, may
represent a promising novel approach for determining
brain neural circuits responsible for nausea, and for
assessing its pharmacological sensitivity.

University of Bologna (Italy). All rats were adult males
of Wistar strain, weighing 220-270 g. Experiment 5 was
conducted on the adult male house musk shrews (Suncus
murinus) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
In Experiment 1, we studied the effect of
provocative motion on food and water consumption in
rats. All food and water was removed from the animals’
cages at the beginning of the light cycle (6:00 AM), and
animal weights were recorded. Rats were either rotated
on a turntable at 0.75 Hz (experimental group, n=9) or
not rotated (control group, n=9) for 40 min just prior to
the start of the dark cycle (6:00 PM). Animals were then
returned to their home cages where pre-weighed water and
standard rat chow were made available to them. Food and
water were then weighed 30 min after the onset of the dark
cycle.
In Experiment 2, we studied the effect of
provocative motion on the core body temperature and on
preferred ambient temperature (Tamb) in another group of
rats. Each animal’s body temperature was recorded using
an implantable datalogger (SubCue, Calgary, Alberta,
Canada), which was stitched to the inner abdominal
wall via midline laparotomy under ketamine-xylazineacepromazine anesthesia (55.6, 5.5, and 1.1 mg/kg i.p.
respectively) and antibiotic protection (enrofloxacin, 5
mg/kg). Animals were allowed to recover for 3 days prior
to experimentation. On the day of the experiment, rats
were placed inside a thermogradient apparatus (previously
described by [33]) to assess baseline preferred Tamb. The
thermogradient apparatus consisted of six 217-cm-long
aluminum channels that run between two water tanks.
Two electric heating units (PolyScience, Niles, IL, USA)
heated the water inside one tank to maintain a Tamb of
30oC inside the channels at the “warm” end, whereas the
water tank at the “cold” end was constantly perfused with
10% ethylene glycol by an external-circulation cooling
pump (PolyScience) to maintain a Tamb of 15oC inside the
channels at the opposite end. By manipulating the water
temperatures at either end, a near-linear temperature
gradient of 0.07oC/cm was maintained along each of the
six channels. Tamb in the thermogradient was continuously
monitored via five evenly-spaced (50cm) thermocouples
per channel. The thermocouples were fed into a
TempScan 1000A receiver (Omega, Stamford, CT, USA),
which relayed temperature data to the TempWindows
software program (Omega) in real-time. A high-definition
video camera (Panasonic WV-CP284, Panasonic, Kadoma,
Osaka, Japan), positioned directly overhead, captured each
animal’s location inside the thermogradient and relayed it
to the TopScan software (Cleversys, Reston, VA, USA)
for tracking along the established temperature gradient.
Rats were then removed, individually housed in their
home cages, and placed on a turntable. The turntable
was rotated at 0.75 Hz (experimental group, n=15) or not
rotated (control group, n=15) for 40 min. Immediately
thereafter, rats were returned to the thermogradient

METHODS
Animals and experimental protocols.
Investigation has been conducted in accordance
with the ethical standards and according to the
Declaration of Helsinki and according to national and
international guidelines and has been approved by the
authors’ institutional review board. Experiments 1 and
2 were conducted at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical
Center (Phoenix, AZ, USA); Experiment 3 – at Mahidol
University (Bangkok, Thailand) and Experiment 4 - at the

apparatus for 3 hours. All animals were well-adapted to
the experimental setups prior to experimentation. No
drugs were administered during this experiment.
In Experiment 3 we studied the effects of
provocative motion on the tail temperature in
uninstrumented rats. The protocol (recording timing,
drug injections and rotation parameters) was identical to
Experiment 3. For assessing tail temperature before and
during provocative motion, infrared video images were
acquired using a thermoimager (FLIR-A20, Flir Systems,
Wilsonville, OR, USA). There were 9 rats in this group.
In experiment 4, we tested whether hypothermic
effect of provocative motion is sensitive to antiemetic
drug ondansetron. Telemetric transmitters (TA11CA-F40,
Data Sciences International, USA) were aseptically
implanted into the peritoneal cavity under isoflurane (2%
in O2) anaesthesia, and animals were left to recover for
1 week; they were housed individually during this time.
On the day of experiment, transmitters were turned on,
home cages were placed on a turntable that was stationary,
and baseline recording of the core body temperature was
obtained for 1 h. At the middle of this period (i.e. at 30
min), animals received i.p. injection of either antiemetic
ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg in 0.5 ml Ringer) or vehicle
(0.5 ml Ringer). Thirty minutes later, the turntable was
switched on, and rotation was maintained for 40 min at
0.75 Hz, This protocol was repeated one week later, with a
counter-balanced administration of ondansetron or vehicle.
During subsequent week 3 and 4, we determined whether
there were any effects of the drug or vehicle alone on the
temperature. For this purpose, the protocol was repeated
again once a week, but without rotation. There were 9
animals in this experiment. Ondansetron was from Sigma
(USA).
In Experiment 5, we studied effects of provocative
motion on the surface body and tail temperature in adult
house musk shrews (Suncus murinus – an insectivore
possessing the vomiting reflex; N = 7). Animals were
housed in groups of 4 per cage. On the day of experiment,
each animal was moved to a new clean cage and remained
in it for 40 min for habituation prior to recording. A cage
with an animal was placed on a laboratory shaker, with
an infrared camera (KC500, Keii, China) fixed above the
cage. A 15-min basal recording was followed by 15-min of
provocative motion (1 Hz, 4 cm linear displacement). We
also quantified the number of retching/vomiting episodes
and their latencies. We did not administer drugs in this
experiment. The ambient temperature for all experiments
was 20-21oC.

used in assessing the preferable ambient temperature.
Radiotelemetric temperature data (Exp. 3) was sampled
at 1 Hz and acquired using MacLab-8s data acquisition
system (ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia), and then
reduced by averaging within every 2-min interval.
Infrared images from rats (Exp. 4) were collected from
individual frames at 2-min intervals; tail temperature
was assessed at the distal region of the proximal third
of the tail. Infrared images from shrews (Exp. 5) were
also collected from individual frames at 2-min intervals.
Using proprietary SmartIRMNet software (Keii, China),
we then determined the superficial skin temperature from
three areas: interscapular region, bottom of the trunk at
the midline, and tail area 1 cm distal from the base. Both
cameras have built-in self-calibration capabilities.
For statistical comparison, data were selected
as following: Exp. 2, body T – mean of the two last
points just before rotation vs. mean of the two points at
maximum (for control animals) or at minimum (rotated
animals); Exp. 2, thermogradient - mean of the two last
points just before rotation vs. mean of the two first points
post-rotation; Exp. 3, rotation condition - mean of the
four last points just before rotation vs. mean of the two
four points during maximal rise in the tail T; Exp. 3,
control – corresponding time intervals; Exp. 4, rotation
condition - mean of the four last points just before rotation
vs. mean of the two four points during maximal fall in
the abdominal; Exp. 4, control – corresponding time
intervals; Exp. 5 mean of the two last points just before
rotation vs. mean of the two four points during maximal
rise or fall in each parameter. Statistical significance for
the differences in water consumtion was performed usin
unpaired Student’s t-test. Statistical differences in the
core body and the cutaneous temperatures were assessed
by means of two-way ANOVA (treatment vs. time) with
Bonferroni correction, with p<0.05 being the threshold for
significance.­
