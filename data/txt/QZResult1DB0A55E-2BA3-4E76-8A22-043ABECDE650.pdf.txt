Abstract:
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumour in
children and adolescents. Despite aggressive therapy, survival outcomes remain
unsatisfactory, especially for patients with metastatic disease or patients with a
poor chemotherapy response. Chemoresistance contributes to treatment failure.
To increase the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy, essential survival pathways
should be targeted concomitantly. Here, we performed a loss-of-function siRNA
screen of the human kinome in SaOS-2 cells to identify critical survival kinases after
doxorubicin treatment. Gene silencing of JNK-interacting-protein-1 (JIP1) elicited
the most potent sensitisation to doxorubicin. This candidate was further explored
as potential target for chemosensitisation in OS. A panel of OS cell lines and human
primary osteoblasts was examined for sensitisation to doxorubicin using small
molecule JIP1-inhibitor BI-78D3. JIP1 expression and JIP1-inhibitor effects on JNKsignalling were investigated by Western blot analysis. JIP1 expression in human OS
tumours was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue micro arrays. BI-78D3
blocked JNK-signalling and sensitised three out of four tested OS cell lines, but not
healthy osteoblasts, to treatment with doxorubicin. Combination treatment increased
the induction of apoptosis. JIP1 was found to be expressed in two-thirds of human
primary OS tissue samples. Patients with JIP1 positive tumours showed a trend to
inferior overall survival. Collectively, JIP1 appears a clinically relevant novel target
in OS to enhance the efficacy of doxorubicin treatment by means of RNA interference
or pharmacological inhibition.

disease, 5-year survival rates are reduced to only 20%
[1-4]. Chemoresistance, both intrinsic and acquired,
is a key issue in the failure of current treatment to cure
patients with OS [5,6]. A variety of combination therapy
regimens and dose escalation of several therapeutics
have not improved survival outcomes. Also, the current
chemotherapy regimens are demanding for the patients
and serious adverse effects, such as severe mucositis,
bone-marrow depression and cardiotoxicity are often
encountered. [7-10] In order to improve treatment efficacy
whilst limiting adverse effects, new treatment strategies
for OS are warranted.
Targeting essential survival pathways in
combination with conventional therapy could be a strategy
to improve the efficacy of current drug regimens. The
identification of key regulators of drug response is an
essential step in the design of such new targeted treatment

strategies. RNA interference (RNAi)-based screening is a
powerful technology for the discovery of candidate drug
targets in malignant cells [11-13]. Proteins of the human
kinome are involved in many cellular processes, including
inter- and intra-cellular signalling, gene transcription,
metabolism, cell shape and motility, proliferation,
differentiation, survival and apoptosis. Kinases are known
to play essential roles in disease development [14,15]
and the kinome is therefore likely to harbour potential
drug targets. Furthermore, kinases have been the subject
of the design and development of small molecule drugs
that target specific pathways in malignant cells [16-20].
This has confirmed the feasibility of targeting kinases
with specific small molecules and their utility as targets
for therapy. Here, we performed an siRNA screen of
the human kinome to systematically identify genes that
are involved in the survival of OS cells treated with

In order to identify regulators of doxorubicin
response in OS, we performed cell viability screens
on SaOS-2 cells using an siRNA library targeting the
100
human kinome (Figure 1A). Screens were performed
three times, each time including pairs of plates with and
without doxorubicin treatment at an approximate IC20
80
concentration. Assay metrics based on mock- versus
siPLK1-treated wells revealed Z’-factors ranging from
0.69 to 0.82
in the three experiments, indicating strong
60
assay resolution [21]. Supplementary Table S1 lists robust
z-scores of all tested genes per screen. The effects of
doxorubicin40plus siRNA treatment were analysed using

an empirical-Bayes linear model. Supplementary Table S2
lists the computed treatment effects for all tested genes.
Table 1 lists the genes that showed a most significant
combination treatment effect (threshold p < 0.025). As
indicator of the sensitising potential of gene silencing to
doxorubicin treatment we calculated relative cytotoxicities
(i.e., doxorubicin plus siRNA effect/doxorubicin effect).
We then selected 10 candidate genes that met the
following criteria: p < 0.025 and FDR < 0.4 and/or p <
0.025 and relative cytotoxicity > 3-fold. The mean relative
cell viabilities of SaOS-2 cells treated with the selected
siRNAs in the presence or absence of doxorubicin are
shown in Figure 1B. siRNA against JIP1 appeared to elicit
120
the most potent and highly significant enhancement of
doxorubicin-induced cell kill (relative cytotoxicity = 8.6;
p = 1.0*E-04; FDR = 2%). To confirm the findings in the
100
primary screen for the 10 candidate genes, the candidates
were reanalysed using 4 siRNAs directed against different
sequences on their mRNA. For 8 candidate genes, the
80
doxorubicin-sensitising phenotype could be reproduced
with at least 3 individual siRNAs, suggesting that they
represent genuine therapeutic targets (Figure 1C). Figure

after doxorubicin treatment, confirming the phenotypethat
was observed with the siRNA pool. In fact, these siRNAs
exhibited a more selective effect, as they caused less direct
cytotoxicity than the pool in the absence of doxorubicin.
This could be explained by a profound cytotoxicity
induced upon transfection of siRNA duplex #1. For this
reason, siRNA duplex #1 was considered to elicit an offtarget effect and was excluded from further analyses.
Supplementary Figure S1 shows the reanalysis results of
the remaining 9 candidate genes. For 7 candidate genes,
i.e. CDKN1C, JIP1, CHKA, CSNK1G2, IRAK2, DOK1,
CLK2 and IL2, the doxorubicin-sensitising phenotype
could be reproduced with at least 3 individual siRNAs.
Two genes could not be confirmed; CDKL1 had only 2
effective duplexes and PRKCSH was excluded from
further analysis because three of the tested duplexes
induced an increase in cell viability, yielding only 1
effective duplex for this gene.

Based on the siRNA screens, we selected JIP1
for further investigations. First, we assessed the genesilencing efficiency obtained with the three functional
JIP1 siRNA duplexes using qRT-PCR. Figure 2A shows
that JIP1 siRNA duplex #2 was the most effective in
suppressing JIP1 mRNA. Silencing JIP1 also depleted
SaOS-2 cells of the protein product, as shown by Western
blot analysis (Fig 2B). Decreased JIP1 protein expression
became evident 2 days after transfection and was most
pronounced at day 3. Doxorubicin dose-response curves
for SaOS-2 cells and SaOS-2 cells transfected with JIP1
siRNA #2 (Fig 2C) demonstrated a significant shift in
IC50, from 0.7 μg/mL for the control treated cells to 0.3
μg/mL for the JIP1 silenced cells (student’s t-test, p <
0.0001). Hence, efficient siRNA-mediated silencing of
JIP1 in SaOS-2 cells reduced JIP1 protein expression,
sensitising the cells to doxorubicin treatment.

Figure 3: JIP1 inhibition sensitises OS cells but not normal osteoblasts to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. (A) Cells were

treated in triplicate with doxorubicin (closed squares) or with doxorubicin and JIP1-inhibitor BI-78D3 (open triangles) and cell viability
was determined four days later. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were created and IC50 values were calculated. The sensitising effect of
JIP1 inhibition to doxorubicin treatment is significant in three out of four OS cell lines, (student’s t-test at IC50; U2OS, p = 0.19, n.s;
SaOS-2, p < 0.05; LM7 and MG-63, p < 0.0001). Human primary osteoblasts Hum63 and Hum65 do not show sensitisation to doxorubicin

caspase activity is distinctly higher in SaOS2, LM7 and MG-63 compared to doxorubicin treatment alone (student’s t-test; LM7: **, p <

78D3 did not augment caspase activation in U2OS cells
(p = 0.48). Thus, the results of the caspase activity assay
were in agreement with the observations made in the
dose-response experiments. We therefore conclude that
sensitisation of OS cells to doxorubicin treatment by JIP1
inhibition is probably caused by promotion of doxorubicininduced apoptosis. Collectively, these data independently
validate JIP1 as a regulator of doxorubicin response in OS
and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of JIP1 could
provide increased efficacy of doxorubicin treatment in OS,
while sparing healthy bone cells.

not affect JIP1 expression (Fig 4B). p-JNK could not be
detected in whole cell lysates (not shown). However, upon
immunoprecipitation with an anti-JIP1 antibody, p-JNK
could be detected in both cell lines (Fig 4B). Doxorubicin
treatment increased p-JNK in complex with JIP1 in LM7
cells, but not in U2OS cells. Concurrent treatment with BI78D3 diminished p-JNK in both cell lines to undetectable
levels, indicating successful inhibition of the JIP1-JNK
interaction and JNK phosphorylation (Fig 4B). Together,
these results suggest that inhibition of JIP1 increases
the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in cells that respond to
doxorubicin treatment by increased JNK-signalling via
assembly of the JIP1-JNK signalling complex.

BI-78D3 inhibits JIP1-JNK interaction and JNKphosphorylation in OS cells.

JIP1 is expressed in a majority of OS tumour
specimens and is associated with poor survival

JIP1 is a scaffold protein that selectively mediates
JNK signalling by assembling specific components of the
MAPK cascade, including MLK, MKK4 and MKK7, in
a signalling complex and JIP1 appears essential for JNK
activation or maintenance of JNK phosphorylation. (2228). In response to environmental stress, JNK is activated
by phosphorylation of residues in its activation loop by
MKK4 and MKK7, which in turn are activated by MLK.
Apart from this, JIP1 has also been implicated in Akt1
activation and suppression of Notch1 activity. (29, 30).
Western blot analysis demonstrated that JIP1 is expressed
in all tested OS cell lines and at a lower level in primary
osteoblasts (Fig 4A). We then investigated JIP1 expression
and JNK phosphorylation in response to doxorubicin
and BI-78D3 treatment in LM7 and U2OS cells. These
cell lines respectively showed a strong and absent
sensitisation to doxorubicin efficacy by treatment with
JIP1-inhibitor BI-78D3. Treatment with doxorubicin did

To assess the clinical relevance of JIP1 and to
investigate if JIP1 could be considered a biomarker for
OS, tissue micro arrays (TMAs) containing 647 cores of
human primary OS samples (corresponding to 130 OS
patients) were stained and analysed for JIP1 expression.
Every tumour was represented by three cores on the
TMAs and certain patients were represented more than
once on the TMA i.e., with cores belonging to primary
biopsies, first resections and metastases. Staining results
were then correlated to clinical data. All samples were
independently scored by two of the authors, with high
observer agreement (Supplementary Table S3). Due
to loss of tissue from the slide as a result of the cutting
and staining procedures, 200 cores were unsuited for
scoring, leaving 447 scored tissue cores. Of these, 67%
were valued “positive” and 33% were valued “negative”.

and Western blot analysis was done with an anti-p-JNK antibody. Doxorubicin-treated LM7 cells show an increased expression level of
p-JNK compared to untreated cells, whereas in U2OS there is a slight decrease in p-JNK after doxorubicin treatment. After concurrent
treatment with BI-78D3, p-JNK expression levels are diminished, indicative of inhibition of JIP1 scaffold function.

Discussion

To study the predictive value of JIP1 staining on overall
survival, we selected first biopsy or resection samples
only; first biopsies had not been exposed to pre-operative
chemotherapy and resection samples had been exposed to
pre-operative chemotherapy. Samples of recurrences (both
metastatic and local) were excluded to avoid confounding
for inferior survival outcome as a result of metastatic and/
or recurrent disease. After applying these criteria, data of
71 patients remained suitable for analysis. Figure 5 shows
a Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis of JIP1 staining in
tumour tissue as predictor of overall survival. Patients with
JIP1 negative tumours showed a better survival outcome
(mean 12.0 years) compared to patients with JIP1 positive
tumours (mean 9.1 years); this difference in overall
survival is borderline significant (LogRank, p = 0.056).
JIP1 staining did not significantly correlate with event-free
survival (p = 0.3) or with relapse (p = 0.2). Moreover, we
did not find a significant association between JIP1 staining
and response to multi-agent chemotherapy (p=0.9)
(Supplementary Table S4). Thus, while JIP1 staining did
not directly correlate to the response to chemotherapy,
JIP1 positivity did show a strong trend towards inferior
overall survival outcome, suggesting a possible role for
outcome prediction in patients with OS. Importantly, JIP1
was found to be expressed in a majority of primary OS
tumour samples, suggesting that JIP1 could be considered
a clinically relevant target for treatment.

In this work, we applied a functional genomics
approach to systematically identify kinases and kinaseassociated proteins that could be targets to enhance
response to doxorubicin treatment in osteosarcoma.
Doxorubicin is one of the major components of OS
chemotherapy treatment, but its efficacy knows limitations
in view of the 65% 5-year survival rate for patients with
localised OS. Improving its efficacy could lead to enhanced
tumour control or chemotherapy dose reduction in
patients. The latter is relevant as doxorubicin is renowned
for the serious adverse effects that regularly arise upon
administration of this drug, especially cardiotoxicity (7).
High throughput RNAi screens have previously been used
successfully to identify essential oncogenes, modulators of
response to anti-cancer drugs and cancer-specific targets
for therapy (11-13, 31-33). Previous work in OS has led to
the identification of potential therapeutic targets in OS by
RNAi kinome library screening (34, 35).
In our siRNA library screen on SaOS-2 human OS
cells, silencing of JIP1 led to the most potent and highly
significant sensitisation to doxorubicin. This finding
could be validated on SaOS-2 cells and two other p53deficient OS cell lines using small molecule JIP1-inhibitor
BI-78D3. OS cells expressed JIP1 at higher levels than
normal osteoblasts and the sensitising effect of JIP1

inhibition to doxorubicin treatment was not observed in
normal osteoblasts. This suggests that JIP1 is important for
the survival of malignant, but not healthy cells subjected
to chemotherapy, which makes JIP1 a potential target for
selective anticancer therapy.
JIP1 is a scaffold protein that, in response to
cellular stress, assembles a JNK activation module
containing various kinases upstream of JNK, such as
MKK4, MKK7 and MLK family members. The physical
proximity between the JNK-signalling components
in the JIP1/JNK signalling complex facilitates the
phosphorylation of JNK and subsequent activation of
the JNK signalling pathways. JIP1 inhibition is expected
to alter or impair JNK-signalling, possibly leading to
reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and downregulation of
AP-1 transcriptional activation (22-27). JNK pathway
activation is observed following cellular stress such as
DNA damage, cytotoxic stress and γ-irradiation. However,
the exact influence of JNK and AP-1 on cell death is
ambiguous and reported to be cell and context dependent
(6, 24, 27, 28, 36, 37). JNK has been found to promote as
well as inhibit apoptosis, possibly depending on different
upstream stimuli. In addition, JNK pathway activation has
been suggested to promote p53-induced apoptosis. Hence,
JNK might only exerts its anti-apoptotic effects in p53deficient tumour cells (28). Our observations are in line
with the described regulation of the JIP1/JNK signalling
module. Treatment with doxorubicin induced JNK
phosphorylation in p53 deficient LM7 cells, but not in
p53 wild type U2OS cells, and inhibition of the JIP1-JNK
interaction completely abrogated JNK phosphorylation. In
addition, p53-null SaOS-2 and LM7 cells and p53-mutated
MG-63 cells, but not p53 wild type U2OS cells (38-40)
and normal osteoblasts, were sensitised to doxorubicin
cytotoxicity upon JIP1 inhibition. Furthermore, increased
cytotoxicity upon combination treatment was associated
with promotion of apoptosis induction. This leads us to
hypothesise that p53 deficient OS cells are sensitised to
doxorubicin by inhibition of anti-apoptotic JNK signalling.
However, given the relatively small number of cell lines
analysed and the redundancy in survival pathways in
tumour cells, this theory remains speculative.
The pharmacological verification of the
chemosensitising effect of JIP1 inhibition in OS cells
with BI-78D3 is promising in view of possible clinical
translation of this treatment strategy, because whereas
RNAi is a powerful, efficient method for the systematic
discovery of drug targets, its applicability in a clinical
setting is limited, mainly due to delivery issues. Although
there is progression in the field of siRNA delivery
techniques and some siRNAs are currently in clinical
development, small molecule inhibitors generally have
better pharmacokinetic properties and the road to clinical
application seems less cumbersome than for siRNA (41).
Additional treatment with a JIP1-inhibitor in OS patients
receiving doxorubicin seems a realistic scenario that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

may elicit improved treatment efficacy and thus requires
clinical studies.
To assess the potential clinical relevance of JIP1
expression in OS patients, we analysed human OS tissue
samples by immunohistochemical staining of TMAs and
correlated JIP1 staining to clinical outcome. At present,
there is no specific predictive or prognostic marker in OS
(42, 43). Prediction of treatment and/or survival outcomes
might be of importance for the stratification of patients
to treatment regimens and enable a more individualised
treatment of OS patients by offering those patients
additional targeted therapy when it could be anticipated
that they will benefit from this specific treatment strategy.
The importance of the discovery of reliable biomarkers
in OS and their possible role in targeted treatment design
has recently been highlighted by other research groups.
(42-45). In this work, we were particularly interested in
the correlations between JIP1 staining and survival and
between JIP1 staining and chemotherapy response. Since,
as demonstrated herein, silencing of JIP1 in OS cells
enhances response to doxorubicin, high JIP1 expression
levels in OS could perhaps correlate with inferior response
to chemotherapy with doxorubicin and consequently
inferior survival outcomes. In our tested dataset, we
could not correlate JIP1 expression to inferior response to
chemotherapy, possibly because all tested specimens were
subdued to multi-agent chemotherapy and not doxorubicin
mono-therapy. Also, given the presumed effect of JIP1
inhibition being dependent on defective p53, it might
be worthwhile to analyse the tested specimens for p53
status. We did observe a distinct difference in overall
survival between patients with positive and negative JIP1
staining, where positive JIP1 staining appeared associated
with inferior survival outcome. While this finding needs
confirmation in an independent dataset, our observation
suggests that JIP1 could be a predictor for overall survival
in patients with localised OS. Furthermore, JIP1 was
found to be expressed in the majority of patient tissue
samples, indicating that JIP1 is a relevant molecule in
OS and that exploitation of JIP1 inhibition as additional
treatment to current standard chemotherapy regimens
could be beneficial to a majority of OS patients. In
conclusion, based on our results, we propose JIP1 as a
potential new drug target for OS to enhance the efficacy
of chemotherapies including doxorubicin.

Dr. E.S. Kleinerman (MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX, USA), respectively. Human primary (shortterm culture) osteoblasts Hum63, Hum65 and Hum71
were obtained from otherwise healthy patients undergoing
total knee replacement after informed consent. All cells,
with the exception of LM7, were cultured in D-MEM
(PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS) and 1 mg/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin
(Gibco) at 37ºC and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.
LM7 was cultured in E-MEM (Lonza) supplemented with
10% FCS, 1 mg/mL Pen-Strep, 1% non-essential amino

MEM-Vitamin solution (all: Gibco, Invitrogen) at 37ºC
and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Doxorubicin
(TEVA/Pharmachemie, Haarlem, the Netherlands) was

the action of cellular enzymes, in which the measured
fluorescent signal is proportional to the number of viable

Plate data was read and configured in R (The
R Project for Statistical Computing) (46) using the
cellHTS2 software package (47). We used the negative
control-medians per plate to center plate-specific log2
intensities and then computed robust z-scores per screen.
The z-score matrix containing 3 untreated and 3 treated
screens was used to study the combination treatment
effect (i.e., combined effect of doxorubicin and siRNA as
discriminated from single agent effects) by means of an
empirical- Bayes linear model, using the limma software
package (48). The obtained p-values for the combination
treatment effect were then corrected for multiple testing
using Benjamini & Hochberg’s step-up false discovery
rate (FDR) (49). The magnitude of sensitisation to
doxorubicin by siRNA transfection was estimated by
calculating the ratio of mean cytotoxicity observed after
combination treatment over mean cytotoxicity observed
after doxorubicin treatment.

siRNA library screening

Doxorubicin dose response analysis and apoptosis
assay

The siRNA screen was performed at the RNA
Interference Functional Oncogenomics Laboratory
(RIFOL) core facility of the VUmc Cancer Center
Amsterdam, using an automated platform and the Human
Protein Kinases ON-TARGETplus siRNA library from
Thermo Fisher Scientific Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO).
This library comprises siRNAs targeting 788 kinase and
kinase-associated genes. Four different siRNA duplexes
designed against each target gene were pooled and arrayed
for screening in 96-well plate format. siRNA against PLK1
was used as a positive control for cell death and mock
treated wells served as negative controls. For confirmation
studies, individual siGENOME siRNAs (TFS Dharmacon)
were used. Forward transfections were done according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations, using 25 nM siRNA
and 0.05% (v/v) Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent (TFS
Dharmacon) in 100 μL culture medium. Figure 1A shows
a schematic overview of the screen design. The screens
were performed three times, each time including one
set of plates with doxorubicin and one without. SaOS-2
cells were plated at a density of 2,000 cells/well in 96well plates (Greiner) and transfected with siRNAs the
next day. Two days post-transfection, doxorubicin was
added to one set of plates to a final concentration of 30
ng/mL; culture medium was added to the other set. Four
days after the start of doxorubicin treatment, cell viability
was determined using the CellTiter-Blue (CTB) Cell
Viability Assay (Promega), measuring fluorescence at 540
nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths using a
Tecan Infinite F200 Microplate Reader (Tecan Trading
AG, Switzerland). The CTB Cell Viability Assay measures
metabolic capacity of viable cells by reduction of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Human OS cells or primary osteoblasts were
plated at a density of 2,000 cells/well in 96-well format
and transfected with JIP1 siRNA as described above or
incubated with BI-78D3 at a non-toxic dose of 10 nM. Two
days after siRNA transfection or concurrently with BI78D3 addition, cells were treated with a doxorubicin dose
range and four days later cell viability was assessed using
the CTB assay as described above. To analyse apoptosis,
OS cells were plated in white opaque 96-wells plates and
treated with doxorubicin (0.1 μg/mL) or combination
treatment with doxorubicin plus BI-78D3 (10nM). At
24h post-treatment, caspase activity was measured using
the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence read-out was
performed using a Tecan Infinite F200 Microplate Reader
(Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland). Results were analysed
using GraphPad Prism® Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software
Inc.). Relative caspase activity was normalised to the
signal measured in the control (PBS) condition.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Cells were plated, allowed to adhere and
transfected with siRNA as described above. Two days
post-transfection cells were harvested by trypsinisation.
Cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen)
and quantified by spectrophotometry using the NanoDrop
ND-1000 and ND-1000 software version 3.3 (Isogen
Lifescience). Per sample, 1 μg total RNA was reverse

transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript® III RT kit
plus Random Primers (Invitrogen). Real time quantitative
PCR for MAPK8IP1 / JIP1 was performed using the
Quantitect primer assay designed for detection with
SYBR-Green (Qiagen). Amplification was measured on a
LightCycler® 480 and analysed using the corresponding
software, Version 1.5 (Roche). Relative MAPK8IP1 / JIP1
gene expression was normalised to that of GAPDH using
the ΔΔCt method (50).

Two tissue micro arrays (TMAs) containing a total
of 647 cores of human primary OS samples (corresponding
to 130 OS patients) and 20 control tissue cores, were
stained and analysed for JIP1 expression (Supplementary
Figure S2A) and then correlated to clinical and survival
data. The TMAs were crafted at the Leiden University
Medical Center (LUMC, Leiden, the Netherlands)
according to the protocol described in Mohseny et al. (51).
All patients were treated for OS at the LUMC in the period
between 1984-2009. Available clinical data includes: age,
gender, location and side of the primary tumour, response
to chemotherapy according to the Huvos grading system
(52) (when available), metastasis, recurrence, date of
recurrence, survival, date of death (when applicable) and
time of follow-up. (See Supplementary Table S4) The
tissue array slides were heated at 60ºC for 20 minutes
prior to deparaffinization in Xylene and rehydration in a
graded series of alcohol. Endogenous peroxidase activity
was inhibited by incubation with 0.3% H2O2 diluted in
methanol for 30 minutes. The arrays were boiled in 10
mM citrate buffer (pH 6) for 10 minutes and subsequently
rinsed in PBS. The slides were incubated with rabbit-antiMAPK8IP1 (181-193) primary antibody at a dilution of
1:500 O/N at 4°C. Antigen visualisation was performed
using the EnVision+ Poly-HRP IHC Kit (Immunologic)
and DAB chromogen solution. Slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted.

Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
Baseline JIP1 protein expression levels across OS
cell lines and primary osteoblasts and JIP1 downregulation
at the protein level 1-5 days after transfection of SaOS-2
cells was assessed using Western blot. Cells were lysed
in buffer containing Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor
Cocktails (Sigma). Proteins were quantified with the
BCA protein Assay Kit (Pierce). A total of 30 μg protein
per sample was separated on a SDS-PAGE gel and
transferred to a PVDF membrane. Blots were incubated
with primary antibodies rabbit-anti-MAPK8IP1 (181193) at a dilution of 1:1,000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and mouseanti-β-actin (Abcam) at a dilution of 1:10,000, followed
by secondary antibody incubation with HRP-conjugated
goat-anti-rabbit and goat-anti-mouse immunoglobulins
(DAKO), respectively. Protein detection and visualisation
was performed using ECL+ Western Blotting Detection
Reagents (Pierce).
Regulation of JIP1 and JNK phosphorylation
following doxorubicin and JIP1-inhibitor BI-78D3
treatment was analysed by immunoprecipitation followed
by Western blot analysis. OS cells and human primary
osteoblasts were plated and treated with doxorubicin (0.3
μg/mL) or combination treatment with doxorubicin plus
BI-78D3 (10 nM) for 4 h and then lysed in phospho-lysis
buffer (HEPES containing 0.5% β-glucose, 0.1% DTT,
0.1% Na3VO4) containing Protease and Phosphatase
Inhibitor Cocktails (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation,
25 μL of IgG-sepharose beads (Pierce) were incubated
with 2 μL rabbit-anti-MAPK8IP1 antibody for 1 h at 4ºC
under continuous motion. The antibody-bead conjugates
were collected by centrifugation, mixed with 60 μg
protein lysate for 1 h at 4ºC under continuous motion.
Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation.
Sample separation and transfer followed as described
above. Primary antibody incubation was done using
rabbit-anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signalling) and secondary
antibody incubation and protein detection were performed
as described above. Protein levels were quantified using
the Image J tool (National Institute of Health, USA).
Intensities were normalised to β-actin levels in the
Western blots and to the internal control sample in the
immunoprecipitation.

Tissue micro array scoring
The stained TMA slides were automatically scanned
using a digital whole slide scanning system (Mirax slide
Scanner system 3DHISTECH Ltd., Budapest, Hungary),
equipped with a numerical aperture of 0.75 and a Sony
DFW-X710 Fire Wire 1/3” type progressive SCAN IT
CCD (pixel size 4.65 x 4.65 μm), with an actual scan
resolution (effective pixel size in the sample plane) at 20x
objective of 0.23 μm. All 647 samples were independently
examined and scored by two of the authors (JP and PE).
The scoring was performed using dedicated TMA scoring
software (3DHISTECH Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) in a
blinded fashion. To facilitate the scoring and improve
the reproducibility of scoring, a consensus chart with
exemplary staining patterns per category was created
(Supplementary Figure S2B) and used by the observers
during the scoring of the samples. The staining per tissue
was assessed and valued as “negative” or “positive”. Due
to loss of cores during the cutting and staining procedure,
not all cores could be included for analysis. Samples were
considered unsuitable for scoring when less than 30% of
tissue was present on the digital copy of the tissue core.
In case of insufficient tissue, the cores were given the
value “no data”. Of each tumour, three cores are present
1178

on the TMA. The grading scale consistend of 3 values (0
= no data; 1 = negative; 2 = positive) To assure a robust
staining score, i.e. reliable scoring per tumour sample,
we applied a threshold of a minimum of 6 scores 1 or
2 (excluding “no data” observations) for tumours to be
included in the statistical analysis. We used the mean of
the scores to assign the final staining result (positive or
negative) to a sample. The clinical data and the staining
results were entered and statistically analysed in SPSS,
version 17.0 (SPSS Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
To assess inter- and intra-observer agreement in grading
JIP1 staining, Kappa statistics were used. Because interand intra-observer reproducibility may be biased by an
overemphasis on patients with grade 0 findings, kappa
values were therefore also calculated with the exclusion
of grade 0 findings (censored Kappa). Values between 0
and 1 were interpreted according to modified published
guidelines (53, 54) (Supplementary Table S3). KaplanMeier analysis was used to assess survival and differential
survival between groups was analysed using the Log
Rank test. To determine significant differences between
categorical groups, the Pearson chi-square test was used.
In numerical groups, the independent t-test and oneway ANOVA were used. The threshold for statistical
significance was set at p < 0.05.
