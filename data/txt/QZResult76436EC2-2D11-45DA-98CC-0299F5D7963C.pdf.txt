Abstract
Protein kinases play important roles in tumor development
and progression. A variety of members of this family of signal
transduction enzymes serve as targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer. We have identified the receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) AXL as a potential mediator of motility and
invasivity of breast cancer cells. AXL is expressed in most
highly invasive breast cancer cells, but not in breast cancer
cells of low invasivity. Ectopic expression of AXL was sufficient
to confer a highly invasive phenotype to weakly invasive MCF7
breast cancer cells. Experimental inhibition of AXL signaling
by a dominant-negative AXL mutant, an antibody against the
extracellular domain of AXL, or short hairpin RNA knockdown
of AXL decreased motility and invasivity of highly invasive
breast cancer cells. To selectively interfere with cancer cell
properties defining the rate of disease progression, we
identified 3-quinolinecarbonitrile compounds, which displayed potent inhibitory activity against AXL and showed
strong interference with motility and invasivity of breast
cancer cells. Our findings validated the RTK AXL as a critical
element in the signaling network that governs motility and
invasivity of breast cancer cells, and allowed the identification
of experimental anti-AXL small molecular inhibitors that
represent lead substances for the development of antimetastatic breast cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):1905–15]

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in western
women. In these patients, it is not the primary tumor, but its
metastases at distant sites that are the main cause of death (1). The
development of chemotherapy as well as endocrine and radiation
therapy, administered as adjuvant treatment after surgery, has led
to a reduction in the risk of relapse to 20–40%. However, adjuvant
treatment has a wide range of acute and long-term side effects.
Over the past 20 years, with the advances in understanding the
molecular basis of signaling pathway dysregulation in various
cancers, a new era of cancer therapy has begun, which is
characterized by the identification of critical regulators of
malignant properties of cancer cells as molecular targets (2, 3).
Deregulated expression of protein kinases by gene deletion,
mutation, or amplification has been found to be important for

tumor initiation and progression, involving cancer cell proliferation, survival, motility, and invasivity, as well as tumor angiogenesis
and chemotherapy resistance (4, 5). Because of their critical
functions in oncogenesis, protein kinases have been at the forefront
of targeted cancer therapy development since the 1980s. Most of
the novel targeted cancer therapeutics currently approved by the
Food and Drug Administration in clinical use interfere with the
signaling action of protein kinases. More than 100 additional
protein kinase inhibitors and antibodies are in clinical trials,
making kinases, after G protein–coupled receptors, the second
most popular drug target class in the pharmaceutical and biotech
industries (3).
In breast cancer, the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) HER2/neu
is overexpressed in f25% of breast cancer patients, and enhanced
expression correlates with lack of response to adjuvant therapy
and poor prognosis (6). Based on this discovery, Herceptin, a
monoclonal antibody against HER2/neu oncoprotein, has been
developed and is in clinical use since 1998 both as a single agent
and in combination with chemotherapies for HER2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, which has helped to significantly prolong survival of patients (7, 8). However, metastatic
breast cancer patients showing no overexpression of HER2/neu do
not benefit from this therapy. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets
are still urgently needed for intervention in breast cancer
metastatic progression.
To identify the genes that mediate progression of breast cancer,
we have focused on key elements of the phosphoprotein-mediated
signaling system because of its established role in human cancer.
After systematically analyzing expression profiles of kinases of 13
weakly invasive and 8 highly invasive breast cancer cell lines and
normal mammary epithelia cell lines by cDNA array hybridization
analysis, we identified a cluster of genes characteristic for highly
invasive cell types. The RTK AXL was part of the gene cluster
predictive of the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells (data not
shown).
The mammalian AXL RTK subfamily includes three closely
related members: AXL, SKY, and MER. The subfamily is characterized by an extracellular domain, consisting of two immunoglobulin-like domains followed by two fibronectin type 3–like domains.
GAS6, originally isolated as a growth arrest–specific gene, is the
common ligand for AXL subfamily receptors (9–11). GAS6 has the
highest affinity for AXL, followed by SKY, and finally MER (11).
GAS6-AXL signaling has been implicated in a host of discrete
cellular responses including cell survival, proliferation, migration,
and adhesion (12).
AXL was originally isolated from patients with chronic
myelogenous leukemia and was shown to have transforming
potential when overexpressed (13, 14). Subsequently, AXL expression has been reported in a wide variety of human cancers (15–20).
Especially in breast cancer patients, a significant correlation was

found between AXL and tumor stage (15). Moreover, some reports
indicated that AXL might be involved in cancer progression
(21, 22). These prompted us to further investigate the role of AXL
in breast cancer.
Here, we show that AXL has an important role in mediating
breast cancer cell motility and invasivity. Moreover, we identified
3-quinolinecarbonitrile compounds that displayed potent inhibitory activity against AXL, and showed strong interference with
motility and invasivity of breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and DAL were supplied by
Sugen. Other human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection.
Antibodies and reagents. For the source of antibodies and reagents, see
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Synthesis of compounds. NA80x1 and SKI-606 were synthesized as
described (23, 24). The chemical structures of compounds were confirmed
by nuclear magnetic resonance and the purity of compounds was >95%
according to high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(MS) analysis.
cDNA array preparations and hybridization analysis. Gene expression was analyzed by cDNA array hybridization analysis as described before
(22). The accession number for AXL is M76125.
Generation of expression constructs and stable cell lines. See
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
In vitro biological assays. To study the effects of AXL on cell
proliferation, motility, and invasivity of breast cancer cells in vitro, 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell
monolayer wound healing assay, Matrigel outgrowth assay, and Boyden
chamber migration and invasion assays were done. (For details, see
Supplementary Materials and Methods.).
Kinase assay. Kinase assays were carried out according to supplier’s
instructions. [g-32P]ATP (10 ACi; Amersham), 100 Amol/L ATP (Sigma),
20 ng AXL kinase, and 250 Amol/L AXL substrate (Upstate) were used for
the assay. Radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6500). IC50 values were calculated by using a four-parameter log fit.
Immunoblot analysis. See Supplementary Materials and Methods.
In vitro association experiments and MS analysis. See Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done by using two-tailed
Student’s t test.

Results
AXL expression correlates with motility and invasivity of
breast cancer cells. Profiling of kinase gene expression in 21
breast cancer cell lines by cDNA array hybridization analysis led to
the observation of high AXL mRNA expression levels in 87.5%
highly invasive breast cancer cell lines, but not in weakly invasive
breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). To confirm cDNA
array data, Northern blot (data not shown) and immunoblot
analyses (Fig. 1A) were done to evaluate the expression levels of
AXL in breast cancer cell lines. In the highly invasive breast cancer
cell lines (BT549, Hs578T, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB435s, and MDA-MB-436; refs. 25–28), AXL was highly expressed. In
contrast, weakly invasive breast cancer cell lines do not or only
weakly express AXL. These results indicate that expression of the
RTK AXL correlates with the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells.
To further investigate the involvement of AXL in motility and
invasivity of breast cancer cells, we stably overexpressed wild-type
AXL (wtAXL) in the weakly invasive breast cancer cell line MCF7
and found that overexpression of wtAXL endowed the cells with a

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

highly invasive phenotype. A significant increase in the motility
(1.3-fold) and invasivity (30-fold) of wtAXL-overexpressing cells
compared with control cells was observed in Boyden chamber
migration and invasion assays (Fig. 1B).
To further study the role of AXL in motility and invasivity of
breast cancer cells, dominant-negative inhibition of AXL through
overexpression of a tyrosine kinase domain deletion mutant
(dnAXL) in highly invasive breast cancer cell lines with high
endogenous AXL expression was done. As expected, treatment of
empty vector–infected MDA-MB-435s cells (control cells) with
GAS6 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of AXL; however, in cells
overexpressing dnAXL, GAS6-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation
was abrogated (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, we examined
the effects of dominant-negative inhibition of AXL on the motility
and invasivity of breast cancer cell lines in cell monolayer wound
healing, Matrigel outgrowth, and Boyden chamber migration and
invasion assays.
When cell motility was examined by the cell monolayer wound
healing assay, we observed that MDA-MB-435s control cells migrated into the wound at a higher rate than the dnAXL-overexpressing MDA-MB-435s cells. Moreover, decreased motility of
dnAXL cells in comparison with MDA-MB-435s control cells was
also confirmed by Boyden chamber migration assay (Fig. 1C).
Invasive behavior of cancer cells is reflected in cell culture by
their ability to grow into Matrigel. Highly invasive breast cancer cell
lines formed stellate colonies with filopodial structures invading
the surrounding matrix, and the noninvasive or weekly invasive
counterparts did not show this phenotype but grew as spherical
clusters on the Matrigel surface. When cell invasivity was examined
by the Matrigel outgrowth assay, as shown in Fig. 1D, MDA-MB435s, BT549, and MDA-MB-231 control cells all formed stellate
colonies; however, the corresponding dnAXL-overexpressing cells
were unable to form such outgrowth structures and grew instead as
spherical clusters. From these results, we concluded that overexpression of dnAXL in cells with high endogenous AXL expression
converted the highly invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells to a
weakly or noninvasive phenotype. Moreover, the dramatic reduction of MDA-MB-435s invasivity by dnAXL overexpression, in
comparison with MDA-MB-435s control cells, was further confirmed by the Boyden chamber invasion assay (Fig. 1D).
In an alternative approach, we examined the effects of short
hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated AXL expression knockdown on the
motility and invasivity of breast cancer cells. To enrich cells in
which the AXL shRNA–mediated knockdown was quite significant,
AXL shRNA–infected cells were stained with anti-AXL monoclonal
antibody 259-9 and sorted by using FACSVantage; the cell portion
with low AXL expression was collected for experiments. As
expected, a dramatic decrease in AXL expression was observed in
AXL shRNA–expressing cells compared with scrambled shRNA–
expressing cells in both MDA-MB-435s and Hs578T cells (Fig. 2A).
We further examined the effects of shRNA-mediated AXL
knockdown on cell migration and invasion, and found that AXL
shRNA–expressing cells have an obviously decreased capacity in
motility and invasivity in comparison with scrambled shRNA–
expressing cells in the Boyden chamber migration (Fig. 2B) and
invasion (Fig. 2C) assays. Moreover, decreased invasivity of AXL
shRNA–expressing cells compared with control cells was also
confirmed by Matrigel outgrowth assay with both MDA-MB-435s
and Hs578T cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, shRNAmediated AXL knockdown only showed mild effects on cell
proliferation under conditions used for migration and invasion

assays (Fig. 2D). These findings, in conjunction with those
described above, strongly support the conclusion that AXL has
an important role in mediating the invasive behavior of breast
cancer cells.
Suppression of cancer cell invasiveness by an anti-AXL
polyclonal antibody. To evaluate the efficacy in vitro of a more
therapy-like intervention strategy, we determined the inhibitory
potential of a polyclonal AXL antibody. We generated a polyclonal
antiserum against the extracellular domain of AXL and studied its
effect on the motility and invasivity of MDA-MB-435s breast cancer
cells. After 7 days, cells treated with control antibody invaded into
the surrounding matrix. However, cells treated with AXL antibody
grew as spherical clusters on Matrigel surface (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory activity of AXL antibody on motility and invasivity of

www.aacrjournals.org

MDA-MB-435s was also confirmed in the Boyden chamber migration and invasion assays. As shown in Fig. 3B and C, after AXL
antibody treatment, the motility and invasivity of MDA-MB-435s
cells were reduced by 50% and 95% respectively, whereas the
motility and invasivity of Hs578T cells were decreased by 19.4% and
23.2%, respectively.
Identification of small molecular AXL inhibitors. Based on
the results of the target validation experiments with breast cancer
cell lines, we initiated efforts to identify small molecular kinase
inhibitors with selective activity on the AXL tyrosine kinase. In
attempts to identify lead compounds, we applied the Nested
Chemical Library technology, which is a novel hit and lead finding
method for rational drug design of kinase inhibitors, developed by
Keri et al. (29). The Nested Chemical Library was designed on the

platform of a diverse kinase inhibitory library organized around 97
core structures with proven kinase inhibitory activity on various
kinase targets. As the first step, we screened chemical validation
library, which was built around 97 core structure and includes
f300 compounds, and found several compounds that had
inhibitory activity against GAS6-driven autophosphorylation of
AXL in intact cells with an IC50 <10 Amol/L. The 3-quinolinecarbonitrile compound NA80x1 is shown in Fig. 4A. As shown in
Fig. 4B, GAS6-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of AXL was
inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 4.11 F
1.47 Amol/L in Hs578T cells; and with an inhibition rate of 67.4%
at 25 Amol/L and 30.2% at 6.25 Amol/L in MDA-MB-435s cells.
To confirm that NA80x1 inhibits AXL phosphorylation directly, the
effects of NA80x1 on AXL kinase activity were assayed in vitro with
recombinant AXL enzyme. As shown in Fig. 4C, NA80x1 inhibited
AXL kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of
12.67 F 0.45 Amol/L.

NA80x1 has previously been reported to have inhibitory activity
against Src kinase (compound 2a in ref. 24). Therefore, we
examined the effect of NA80x1 on the phosphorylation of the
Src kinase family active site residue Tyr416 in breast cancer cells
(Fig. 4B). In MDA-MB-435s cells, phosphorylation of Src Tyr416 was
inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. At 3.125 Amol/L inhibition
was 50%, and at 12.5 Amol/L it was almost complete. However, in
breast cancer cells Hs578T, NA80x1 at 6.25 and 12.5 Amol/L only
slightly inhibited phosphorylation. Because the anti–phospho-Src
(Tyr416) antibody used in these experiments cross-reacts with all
members of the Src family, this result might be due to a different
inhibitory activity of NA80x1 against different Src kinase family
members or differences in membrane penetration of the compound in different cell lines.
Because AXL has an important role in motility and invasivity of
breast cancer cells, we further checked the effects of NA80x1 on
these properties of breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, NA80x1

inhibited the migration and invasion of cells in a dose-dependent
manner as compared with the control in Boyden chamber migration
and invasion assays. At 6.25 Amol/L, NA80x1 inhibited cell motility
by 70.0% and 46.1%, and cell invasivity by 96.2% and 41.1%, in
MDA-MB-435s and Hs578T cells, respectively. At 25 Amol/L,
NA80x1 almost completely blocked the motility and invasivity
of both MDA-MB-435s and Hs578T cells. In addition, the inhibitory
effect of NA80x1 on MDA-MB-435s and Hs578T was confirmed
in cell monolayer wound healing experiments (Supplementary
Fig. S4A) and Matrigel outgrowth assays (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
To check if the inhibitory activity of NA80x1 on motility and
invasivity of breast cancer cells is partially due to the inhibitory
activity of NA80x1 on cell growth, we analyzed the effects of
NA80x1 on proliferation of Hs578T and MDA-MB-435s cells by
MTT assay and found that NA80x1 did not show obvious
interference with this cancer cell function (data not shown).
AXL is a target of the Src/Abl inhibitor SKI-606. In continuing efforts to develop more potent AXL kinase inhibitors than
NA80x1, we identified a 3-quinolinecarbonitrile compound, SKI606 (Fig. 5A), with more potent inhibitory activity against AXL
autophosphorylation. This compound was developed as an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases and is currently in phase II clinical
trials for the treatment of several cancer types including breast
cancer.
As shown in Fig. 5B, SKI-606 inhibited AXL kinase activity in a
dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 0.56 F 0.08 Amol/L (i.e.,
20-fold lower than NA80x1). To confirm the measured biochemical
activity of SKI-606 in a cell-based assay, the effects on tyrosine

www.aacrjournals.org

phosphorylation of AXL after GAS6 stimulation were examined in
MDA-MB-435s and Hs578T breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 5C,
GAS6-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of AXL was inhibited
with an IC50 of 0.34 F 0.04 Amol/L in Hs578T cells, and with an
inhibition rate of 83.6% at 6.25 Amol/L and 68.6% at 1.56 Amol/L in
MDA-MB-435s cells. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of SKI-606
on AXL is similar as on Src, the target it was developed for. SKI-606
inhibited the phosphorylation of the Src kinase family phosphorylation site Tyr416 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of
0.63 F 0.04 Amol/L in Hs578T cells and 0.55 F 0.01 Amol/L in
MDA-MB-435s cells (Fig. 5C).
Furthermore, we determined the effects of SKI-606 on the
motility and invasivity of breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 5D,
SKI-606 potently inhibited the migration and invasion of MDA-MB435s and Hs578T in Boyden chamber migration and invasion
assays. At 1.56 Amol/L, SKI-606 inhibited cell motility by 70.7% and
25.4%, and cell invasivity by 85.9% and 63.3%, in MDA-MB-435s
and Hs578T cells, respectively. At 6.25 Amol/L, SKI-606 almost
completely blocked the motility and invasivity of both MDA-MB435s and Hs578T cells.
We also checked the effects of SKI-606 on cell growth of MDAMB-435s and Hs578T cells by MTT assay, and found that SKI-606
can inhibit cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with an
IC50 of 9.0 F 1.3 and 5.9 F 0.3 Amol/L, respectively. However, under
the conditions used for migration and invasion assays, SKI-606 had
only a weak effect on cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S5).

NA80x1 have previously been reported to be ATP-competitive
inhibitors, it is likely that they act on even more targets than the
previously reported Src and Abl family kinases and as shown here
on AXL. To profile the cellular proteins targets of NA80x1 and SKI606, we adopted a recently developed proteomics approach, which
relies on the use of immobilized inhibitor analogues as capture
reagents for selective isolation of drug-interacting protein species
in a cellular system (30).
Based on earlier structural and medicinal chemistry data, we
reasoned that the N-methylpiperazine group of SKI-606 is exposed
at the surface of the kinase domain, and therefore synthesized SKI-

606 derivative VI17525 with a primary amine at the position of the
N-methylpiperazine function for directed covalent immobilization
and the generation of an affinity purification resin with SKI-606like binding properties (Fig. 6A). Accordingly, we synthesized an
immobilizable NA80x1 derivative, VI17614, by replacement of the
C-7 methoxy group with a 3-aminopropoxy chain (Fig. 6A).
Covalent coupling of this compound resulted in an affinity resin
with NA80x1-like binding properties.
To identify the specific targets of VI17525 and VI17614, we
combined stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture
(SILAC) with the chemical proteomics approach. Equal amounts of

lysates from three populations of differentially SILAC-encoded
Hs578T cells were used for in vitro association experiments with
the VI17525, control, and VI17614 resins. The protein eluates
from the respective affinity purifications were combined, digested
with the protease trypsin, and the resulting peptide fractions were
then analyzed by MS. Identified peptides were quantified using the
MSQuant software and the respective protein ratios for binding to
the different resins were then determined (see Supplementary
Table). The Arg6/Lys4 versus Arg0/Lys0 and Arg6/Lys4 versus Arg10/
Lys8 ratios represent the relative binding of proteins to control
resin (Arg6/Lys4) compared with VI17525 (Arg0/Lys0) and VI17614
(Arg10/Lys8) resins. In total, 146 different proteins were identified
with at least two unique peptides in the MS experiments. Among
them, 43 proteins were found to specifically bind to the
immobilized compounds because they showed <10% binding to

control matrix in comparison with the binding observed with
either VI17525 or VI17614 matrix.
Among the 43 putative target proteins, 32 proteins were kinases
(Fig. 6B; Supplementary Table). In addition to known targets such
as Src/Abl family kinases Src, Lyn, Arg, and the RTK AXL, which we
functionally characterized as a cellular target in this study, we
identified a variety of other inhibitor-interacting proteins including
eight more tyrosine kinases (such as focal adhesion kinase and four
Eph receptor kinase family members) as well as nine members
from the STE group of kinases involved in mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (including six MAP4K/STE20
kinase family members and two MAP2K family members).
We further subgrouped the putative protein targets by the ratio
Arg10/Lys8 versus Arg0/Lys0 (VI17614:VI17525), which represents
the relative affinity of proteins to VI17614 resin compared with

VI17525 resin. Fourteen proteins have a ratio of <0.5, which
indicates that these proteins might have higher affinity toward
VI17525 compared with VI17614; eight proteins have a ratio of >2,
which indicates that these proteins might have higher affinity to
VI17614 compared with VI17525. Another 21 proteins have a ratio
between 0.5 and 2, which indicates that these proteins either have
similar affinity to these two resins or, alternatively, have high
binding affinities beyond a certain threshold that results in
quantitative retention by both VI17614 and VI17525 under the
conditions of the in vitro association experiments (Fig. 6B).
To validate the MS data, we investigated the interaction of
several putative target proteins with VI17525, VI17614, and control matrix in vitro. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that all of six
putative target proteins specifically interacted with VI17525 and
VI17614 resins. In addition, the binding pattern of target proteins
to VI17525 compared with VI17614 is the same as what is obtained from MS analysis, thus verifying the identifications by MS
(Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Metastasis is the primary death cause of breast cancer patients.
The process is complex and consists of a series of sequential steps,
including intravasation of cells from a primary tumor into the
blood circulation, survival of cells in the bloodstream, arrest in a
new organ, extravasation into the surrounding tissue, initiation and
maintenance of growth, and vascularization the tumor metastasis.
Obviously, the capability to migrate and invade through tissue
barriers is essential for cancer cells to successfully complete the
process of metastasis (1, 31).
In this study, we identified the RTK AXL as a potential mediator
of motility and invasivity of breast cancer cells. Based on our
systematic approach, we found that the expression of AXL was
correlated with the invasive properties of breast cancer. Ectopic
overexpression of wtAXL can endow nonmetastatic MCF7 human
breast cancer cells with a highly invasive phenotype. Conversely,
inhibition of endogenous AXL signaling in highly invasive breast
cancer cells by a dominant-negative mutant or shRNA knockdown
results in decreased capacity to migrate toward attractants and
loss of the capacity to invade the surrounding matrix. Furthermore,
a previous report had shown that there is a significant relation
between AXL and tumor stage in breast cancer patients, which is in
agreement with our hypothesis that AXL plays a pivotal role in
breast cancer metastasis. Interestingly, recently AXL was also
reported to be a mediator of invasion in lung cancer (17) and
glioblastoma (22). These reports support and emphasize an
important role of AXL signaling in the metastatic progression of
various cancer types.
In addition to its function in the control of cancer cell motility
and invasivity that we investigated in this study, AXL may also have

a role in tumorigenesis of breast cancer. Using a human MDA-MB231 breast cancer xenograft model, Holland et al. (21) showed that
RNA interference–mediated inhibition of AXL expression in tumor
cells blocked tumor growth in vivo.
Besides its metastasis-promoting activity, AXL might play a role
in other cell biological properties relevant to breast cancer
progression. This was suggested in a previous study that showed
the ability of GAS6/AXL signaling to protect NIH3T3 cells from
serum starvation or tumor necrosis factor-a–induced apoptosis
(32). In the progression of cancer, cells have to face the challenge of
nutrient starvation and apoptosis induced by death signals.
Whether GAS6/AXL signaling has an antiapoptotic function to
facilitate survival of cancer cells in circulating bloods and the
formation of micrometastases in distant tissues remains to be
investigated. Moreover, AXL might support vital processes required
for neovascularization because silencing of AXL in an in vivo
angiogenesis model produced a phenotype similar to vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor-2/Flk-1 function knockdown
(21, 33).
Taken together, AXL seems to have multiple roles in tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer. Therapeutic intervention
in AXL signaling function offers a novel avenue toward the
multifunctional treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
In the development of targeted agents against RTKs, monoclonal
antibodies that target the extracellular domain of RTKs and smallmolecular inhibitors that target the intracellular kinase domains of
the RTKs are two main cancer treatment strategies (34). Currently,
all of the kinase-targeting anticancer agents that are approved for
clinical use belong to these two classes.
Antibodies, by virtue of the fact that they are highly specific,
represent an ideal approach for selectively interfering with a
single target molecular. In this study, we performed experimental
therapy against breast cancer in vitro by using a polyclonal AXL
antibody, and showed that the antibody successfully inhibited
the motility and invasivity of MDA-MB-435s breast cancer cells,
which proved that developing a therapeutic monoclonal anti-AXL
extracellular domain antibody is a promising strategy for the
treatment of invasive breast cancer. The recently characterized
crystal structure of the immunoglobulin-like domains of AXL
ectodomain and first laminin G–like domain of GAS6 complex
(35) should be helpful for the rational development of therapeutic
antibodies against AXL.
Small molecular inhibitors represent an alternative approach for
developing kinase-targeted cancer therapeutics, which can block
the function of RTKs by binding to the ATP-binding site and
thereby blocking the kinase activity and downstream signaling
pathways. Previous studies have shown that AXL signaling is quite
complex. Besides GAS6-triggered AXL signaling pathways, AXL
could be activated by a ligand-independent mechanism (36) or
by cross–talk with other signaling pathways (36, 37). For example,

antibodies: AXL and Src (equal binding to VI17525 and VI17614 resins), EphB4 and cyclin G–associated kinase (GAK ; higher binding to VI17525 resin), and protein
kinase Ca (PKCa ) and glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3b; higher binding to VI17614 resin).

Budagian et al. (37) uncovered a novel alliance between interleukin15 (IL-15) receptor a and AXL RTK, which enables IL-15 to
transactivate AXL and its associated signaling pathways without
involvement of GAS6. Therefore, it seems to be necessary to
develop AXL small molecular inhibitors for complete blocking of all
activation modes of AXL signaling. In our efforts to develop small
molecular AXL inhibitors, we found that 3-quinolinecarbonitrile
compounds have potent inhibitory activity against AXL autophosphorylation activity, which provides a good scaffold for further
development of clinically useful AXL inhibitors.
SKI-606 is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment
of several cancer types including breast cancer. In our study, we
have found that SKI-606 strongly interfered with the motility and
invasivity of invasive breast cancer cells. In addition, Jallal et al.
(38) recently reported that SKI-606 significantly inhibited the
invasion, growth, and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo. All of these data indicate that SKI-606
might be a potential therapeutic agent for blocking breast cancer
growth and metastasis. Because more than 500 proteins kinases
identified in the human genome share a similar ATP pocket, there
is great potential for SKI-606 and NA80x1 to interact with multiple
kinases, in addition to the known targets including Src/Abl kinase
family and AXL, the target reported here. To better understand
which targets might be significant or responsible for the biological
efficacy of these inhibitors, an analysis of the target profile of
SKI-606 and NA80x1 was done by using a chemical proteomics
method. Forty-three proteins were identified as potential targets,
including 32 kinases. In accordance with our results, Bantscheff
et al. (39) recently used a quantitative chemical proteomics approach to identify the cellular targets of SKI-606 in K562 leukemia
cells, and obtained a comparable protein kinase target profile.
Notably, in addition to Src (40) and AXL, the approach identified
another two targets, focal adhesion kinase (41, 42) and MAP4K4

(43, 44), which are known to play an important role in motility
and invasivity of cancer cells. Additionally, several members of
Eph receptor family, which is reported to be involved in tumor
growth and angiogenesis (45), were identified as targets for both
of the inhibitors. Whether and how these potential targets contribute to the biological efficacy of NA80x1 and SKI-606 require
further investigation.
Taken together, our study shows that AXL is a potential target
for therapy development against invasive breast cancer. It was
validated by the development of anti-AXL polyclonal antibodies
and small molecular kinase inhibitors. 3-Quinolinecarbonitrile
compounds can target multiple kinases in addition to Src, for
which they were originally validated, and therefore provide new
chemical leads toward more potent cancer therapies that interfere
with multiple signaling pathways that are vital for cancer cells and
critical for cancer progression.
