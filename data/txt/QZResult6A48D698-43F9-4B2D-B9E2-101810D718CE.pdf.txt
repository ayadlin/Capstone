Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are currently approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and are in midlate stage trials for other cancers. The HDAC inhibitors LAQ824 and SAHA increase phosphocholine (PC) levels in
human colon cancer cells and tumor xenografts as observed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In this
study, we show that belinostat, an HDAC inhibitor with an alternative chemical scaffold, also caused a rise in
cellular PC content that was detectable by 1H and 31P MRS in prostate and colon carcinoma cells. In addition, 1H
MRS showed an increase in branched chain amino acid and alanine concentrations. 13C-choline labeling indicated
that the rise in PC resulted from increased de novo synthesis and correlated with an induction of choline kinase a
expression. Furthermore, metabolic labeling experiments with 13C-glucose showed that differential glucose
routing favored alanine formation at the expense of lactate production. Additional analysis revealed increases in
the choline/water and phosphomonoester (including PC)/total phosphate ratios in vivo. Together, our ﬁndings
provide mechanistic insights into the impact of HDAC inhibition on cancer cell metabolism and highlight PC as a
candidate noninvasive imaging biomarker for monitoring the action of HDAC inhibitors. Cancer Res; 72(4);

Introduction
Histone acetylation is a key regulator of eukaryotic gene
expression which controls DNA accessibility to transcription
factors and mRNA transcription. The histone acetylation/
deacetylation balance is maintained by the opposing activities
of histone acetyl transferases and histone deacetylases
(HDACs) resulting in cell-speciﬁc gene expression patterns
(1). Deregulation of histone acetylation results in abnormal
gene expression proﬁles involved in controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is associated with
malignancy (2–5).

HDACs also act on other nonhistone proteins that are
subject to regulation by acetylation including some transcription factors (e.g., E2F) and the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)
molecular chaperone, which maintains the conformational
stability of several oncogenic proteins (e.g., ErbB2; ref. 6).
HDAC inhibition is a promising antitumor approach for
simultaneously targeting multiple oncogenic players and pathways. Several HDAC inhibitors have been described that induce
potent antitumor effects in cells and tumor xenografts (6–8).
The HDAC inhibitors SAHA (vorinostat) and depsipeptide
FK228 (romidepsin) have gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treatment
and many more are currently under clinical evaluation (6, 8–
11). One example is belinostat which has shown promising
activity in preclinical cancer models and in patients (8, 12).
The development and evaluation of novel HDAC inhibitors
require the identiﬁcation and validation of pharmacodynamic
(PD) biomarkers of drug activity. These are important because
they inform on the inhibition of the intended biochemical
target, help assess response dynamics, aid treatment schedule
and dose planning, and subsequently allow therapeutic efﬁcacy
assessment (13–15). In contemporary drug development, noninvasive endpoints of target modulation are highly desirable as
they do not involve surgical intervention and allow longitudinal studies in the same patient to be carried out (15–17).
Noninvasive imaging of cancer metabolism is a valuable
approach for PD biomarker discovery that exploits the altered
metabolic features of tumors relative to normal tissues,

HDAC Inhibition Upregulates Choline Metabolism

including increased lipid synthesis and aerobic glycolysis (18,
19). These metabolic changes are increasingly being investigated as diagnostic as well as treatment response biomarkers,
with techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS) being of particular value for translating ﬁndings from
preclinical models to humans (16, 17, 20–22).
MRS allows the detection of many metabolites (e.g., those
related to glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism) and in
preclinical studies has shown that response to molecularly
targeted therapeutics is often associated with altered metabolism (17, 20). For example, inhibitors of HSP90 (23, 24),
phospholipase Cg1 (25), mitogen-activated protein kinase
(26), or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (27, 28) have all been
shown to alter choline phospholipid metabolism in human
cancer cells. In the case of the HDAC inhibitor LAQ824,
in vitro and in vivo MRS showed increased phosphocholine
(PC) levels both in human colon cancer cells and tumors
posttreatment (29). A similar effect was also observed in
human colon and prostate cancer cells treated with the
HDAC inhibitor SAHA (29) or its ﬂuoroanalogue (30), respectively. Furthermore, LAQ824 treatment caused a substantial
reduction in tumor bioenergy-related metabolites [e.g.,
nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) and glucose] that was
observed in vivo but not in vitro (29). This effect was
attributed to the antiangiogenic action of LAQ824, whereas
the rise in PC was likely to relate to the effect of HDAC
inhibition on tumor cell metabolism (29) although the
molecular and biochemical mechanisms behind this change
remain unclear.
Here, we assess (i) whether similar metabolic effects would
be observed with the alternative chemotype (chemical scaffold) HDAC inhibitor and probe compound belinostat and (ii)
the molecular and biochemical processes underlying the
observed metabolic alterations.
We show that HDAC inhibition with belinostat in human
cancer cells leads to increased alanine and branched-chain
amino acid (BCAA) content that was associated with altered
glucose utilization. Belinostat also increased PC levels, thus
conﬁrming our previous ﬁnding with the alternative chemotype agent LAQ824. Importantly, we show for the ﬁrst time that
this effect is associated with induction of choline kinase a
(ChoKa) gene and protein expression. The increase in PC is
also observed in belinostat-treated tumors in vivo, thus supporting the role of PC as a potential noninvasive metabolic
imaging biomarker of HDAC inhibition.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human HT29 colon and PC3 prostate carcinoma cells
(American Type Culture Collection; ATCC) were grown in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium or RPMI, respectively,
containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin in a 37 C humidiﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells
were preserved and propagated according to ATCC's protocols,
screened monthly for mycoplasma and passaged for no longer
than 3 months. All cell culture materials were from Life
Technologies.

www.aacrjournals.org

Western blot
Analysis of the molecular effects of HDAC inhibition was
conducted by Western blotting as previously described (29).
The primary antibodies rabbit antiacetyl histone-3 (Millipore),
rabbit anti-ChoKa (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Chemicon), and rabbit a-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology) were used. The
secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from
GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Buckinghamshire).
Growth inhibition and cell-cycle analysis
Cell counts were carried out on a Beckman Coulter Vi-Cell
Cell Viability Analyzer. The impact of belinostat on cell proliferation and cell-cycle distributions was assessed with the
sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and ﬂow cytometry, respectively, as previously described (27).
Cell treatment for in vitro MRS
PC3 and HT29 cells were treated for 24 hours with belinostat
(0.9 and 2 mmol/L, respectively), to obtain a 30% to 50%
reduction in cell counts and induction of histone-3 acetylation
as a characteristic molecular biomarker of HDAC inhibition
(9).
HT29 cells were further treated with 2 mmol/L belinostat for
4 and 16 hours to assess response time dynamics. Control cells
were treated with 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
For 13C-tracer experiments, HT29 cells were treated as above
for 16 hours followed by a further 3-hour incubation in fresh
medium containing DMSO or 2 mmol/L belinostat and 28
mmol/L [1,2–13C]-choline (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories;
ﬁnal concentration 56 mmol/L) or 5 mmol/L [1–13C]-glucose
(Sigma-Aldrich; ﬁnal concentration 25 mmol/L).
At the end of treatment, cells were extracted with a dualphase method (26) and samples lyophilized for MRS analysis.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with the RNAeasy Kit (QIAGEN),
and 500 ng was reverse transcribed with the High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Samples were diluted 1:5, and 1 mL used in the Taqman assay, using
Taqman universal master mix, and the Hs03682798_m1 assay
for the ChoKa gene CHKA (CHKA speciﬁc primers and FAMlabeled probe) multiplexed with the 4326314E assay for large
ribosomal protein 0 gene LRP0 (LRP0-speciﬁc primers and VIClabeled probe; Applied Biosystems). mRNA levels of CHKA and
LRP0 were determined for each sample in the same well on the
ABI 7900HT. CHKA mRNA levels were expressed relative to
those of LRP0.
HT29 human colon tumor xenograft model
MF-1 male nude mice were injected subcutaneously in the
ﬂank with 5  106 HT29 human colon carcinoma cells. Tumor
volume was calculated by measuring the length, width, and
depth using calipers and the formula L  W  D  (p/6). Once
an appropriate tumor volume (350 mm3) was established (3–
4 weeks later), mice were randomized into 2 groups; one group
was treated with belinostat in vehicle (10% DMSO in water) at
60 mg/kg p.o. once a day for 3 days (days 1, 2, and 3; n ¼ 13), and

one group was treated with vehicle alone (n ¼ 12). A cohort of
animals (6 vehicle- and 6 belinostat treated) was used in the
MRS study, and tumors were excised on day 3 for Western
blotting or in vitro MRS. Another animal cohort (6 vehicle- and
7 belinostat treated) was used to study tumor growth delay
where animals were treated as above and tumor volumes
monitored for a further 6 days after the last dose. Animals
were treated in accordance with local and national ethical
requirements and with the UK National Cancer Research
Institute (NCRI) Guidelines for the Welfare and Use of Animals
in Cancer Research (31).
In vivo MRS of HT29 tumors
Mice were anesthetized as previously described (29) and
scanned in a 7T Bruker Magnetic Resonance System spectrometer with tumors positioned in the center of a 15-mm
2-turn 1H/31P surface coil. In vivo localized PRESS 1H MRS
(echo time (TE) ¼ 136 ms and repetition time (TR) ¼ 4 s) and
image-selected spectroscopy 31P MRS (TR ¼ 2 s) of the tumors
were carried out before treatment (day 0) and the last day of
treatment (day 3). 1H and 31P MR spectra were quantiﬁed with
jMRUI as previously described (24). After the ﬁnal scan, tumors
were excised and stored at 80 C for subsequent in vitro MRS
or Western blotting.
The surface coils used to obtain the 31P MRS signal from
subcutaneous tumors in vivo have a nonuniform spatial sensitivity making it difﬁcult to normalize to an external standard.
Therefore, the signal intensities observed by in vivo 31P MRS are
expressed as metabolite ratios.
In vitro MRS of tumor extracts
Freeze-clamped HT29 tumors (200 mg) were extracted
in 6% ice-cold perchloric acid (PCA) as previously described
(29). Neutralized extracts were freeze dried and reconstituted in 1 mL of D2O and 0.5 mL was then analyzed. Sodium
3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionate (TSP; 50 mL,
5 mmol/L) was added as an internal chemical shift and
quantiﬁcation reference. The pH of the samples was reneutralized with PCA or KOH followed by acquisition of watersuppressed 1H MRS spectra. For 31P MRS, EDTA (50 mL, 60
mmol/L) was added to chelate metals ions, and methylenediphosphonic acid (internal reference; 50 mL, 5 mmol/L) was
added.
In vitro MRS of cell extracts and media samples
Lyophilized samples of the aqueous fraction of cell extracts
were processed as above. The lipid phase of cell extracts was
reconstituted in CDCl3 containing 0.56 mmol/L trimethyl
silane (internal standard). Media samples from the [1–13C]glucose experiments were prepared by adding 50 mL D2O and
50 mL TSP (5 mmol/L, internal reference) to 0.45 mL of
medium.
1
H and 31P spectra were acquired as previously described
(23). 13C MR spectra were acquired using power gated composite pulse 1H decoupling, a 30 degrees ﬂip angle, a 2 seconds
repetition delay, a spectral width of 220 ppm and 32 K data
points. Spectral processing and metabolite quantitation were
carried out as previously described (23).

Results
Belinostat treatment alters cellular metabolism in
human HT29 and PC3 carcinoma cells
Belinostat inhibited proliferation in HT29 colon and PC3
prostate cancer cells as shown by the sulforhodamine B (SRB)
assay (Supplementary Table S1). The respective exposure of
HT29 and PC3 cells to 2 mmol/L (5  GI50) and 0.9 mmol/L (3 
GI50) belinostat for 24 hours led to a substantial reduction in
cell counts to 57%  3% and 77%  2% of controls, respectively
(P  0.001). Western blotting showed the induction of histone3 acetylation posttreatment with belinostat consistent with
HDAC inhibition in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). Signiﬁcant alterations in cell-cycle proﬁles were observed after belinostat
treatment characterized by a build up in the G1 and G2–M
cell populations concomitant with a reduction in the S phase
fraction in HT29 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To evaluate the metabolic effects of HDAC inhibition, we
analyzed the 1H and 31P MR spectra from the aqueous
fractions of HT29 and PC3 cell extracts posttreatment with
belinostat.
Relative to controls, 1H MRS revealed time-dependent
increases in PC levels in HT29 cell extracts which were also
present in PC3 cells following a 24-hour exposure to belinostat
(Fig. 1B and C). Decreased glycerophosphocholine (GPC) levels
were also recorded in HT29 cells at 16 and 24 hours, and PC3
cells at 24 hours; nevertheless, the total choline (tCho) signal
comprising PC þ GPC remained higher, relative to controls,
following belinostat treatment in both cell lines (Fig. 1C).
In addition, we also observed time-dependent increases in
levels of the BCAAs (comprising valine, leucine, and isoleucine), alanine, and threonine in belinostat-treated HT29 cells
compared with controls (Fig. 1B and C). Similar effects on
BCAA and alanine were also observed in PC3 cells at 24 hours
following belinostat treatment (Fig. 1C).
31
P MRS analysis conﬁrmed the 1H MRS observed changes
showing that, relative to controls, PC levels were not signiﬁcantly altered at 4 hours (19  3 vs. 19  2 fmol per cell; n ¼ 3)
but increased signiﬁcantly at 16 hours (17  2 vs. 25  2 fmol
per cell; n ¼ 5, P ¼ 0.02) and 24 hours (18  1 vs. 27  2 fmol per
cell; n ¼ 6, P ¼ 0.0003). GPC levels decreased signiﬁcantly at 16
hours (7  1 vs. 4  1 fmol per cell; P ¼ 0.02) and 24 hours (8  1
vs. 6  1 fmol per cell; P ¼ 0.03) posttreatment. Data from the
24-hour time point are further summarized in Table 1, which
also shows a similar increase in PC levels in PC3 cells treated
with belinostat.
1
H MRS analysis of the lipid fraction of HT29 cell extracts
indicated that phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) levels, determined by integrating the N-trimethyl resonance at 3.2 ppm,
increased from 204  18 arbitrary units per cell to 290  28
arbitrary units per cell following belinostat treatment (n ¼ 4,
P ¼ 0.04).

Figure 2. The effect of belinostat treatment (16 þ 3 hours) on C-glucose utilization in HT29 human colon cancer cells. A, C spectra of HT29 cells incubated in
[1–13C]-glucose for 3 hours showing the effect of belinostat treatment (2 mmol/L) on [4–13C]-glutamate (Glut), [3–13C]-lactate (Lac), and [3–13C]-alanine (Ala). B,
quantitation of 13C-labelled glucose, lactate (intra- and extracellular), alanine, and glutamate in control and belinostat-treated HT29 cells following a 3-hour
incubation in [1–13C]-glucose showing increased alanine formation and decreased lactate production.

13

C-glucose levels; however, extracellular [3–13C]-lactate (measured by 13C MRS of cell culture media) decreased markedly to
25%  11% relative to controls (n ¼ 4, P ¼ 0.007). Interestingly,
the reduction in 13C-lactate production was paralleled with a
signiﬁcant rise, by almost 3-fold, in the amount of the 13C label
incorporated into [3–13C]-alanine as shown in Fig. 2A and B. A
slight reduction in intracellular [3- 13C]-lactate and increase in
[4–13C]-glutamate were also noted but neither of these effects
reached statistical signiﬁcance (P 	 0.2). The [4–13C]-glutamate/[3–13C]-lactate ratio, however, increased by almost
3-fold (P ¼ 0.03).
Altogether, these data suggest that belinostat treatment
induced a shift in glucose routing, leading to a reduction in
glucose ﬂux to lactate in favor of a rise in alanine formation.
HDAC inhibition with belinostat increases de novo PC
synthesis and induces ChoKa expression
To investigate the basis for the PC rise, HT29 cells were
cultured in the presence of [1,2–13C]-choline to monitor label
incorporation into PC post-vehicle or belinostat treatment.
13
C MRS of the aqueous fraction of cell extracts following a
3-hour incubation in 13C-choline indicated that the levels of
13
C-labelled PC, synthesized from the incorporation of
13
C-choline, increased to 155%  12% in belinostat-treated
cells relative to controls (Fig. 3A and B; P ¼ 0.01). This degree of
increase is comparable with the fold rise in PC recorded by
31
P and 1H MRS, suggesting that the effect on the steady-state
levels of this metabolite is due to increased de novo formation.
To characterize the molecular drivers of this effect, we
assessed the expression of ChoKa, the enzyme that catalyses
the formation of PC from its precursor choline. Quantitative
real-time (qRT)-PCR analysis indicated that following belinostat treatment the levels of ChoKa mRNA were induced by
2.3-fold at 4 hours, 3.5-fold at 16 hours, and 3.2-fold at 24 hours
relative to controls in HT29 cells (Fig. 3C), and this effect
correlated strongly with the increase in PC levels observed by
MRS (r ¼ 0.99, P ¼ 0.02). ChoKa mRNA was also induced to
148%  8% relative to controls (n ¼ 9, P ¼ 0.002) in PC3 cells
following a 24-hour treatment with belinostat. Western blot-

994

ting of the HT29 cell samples from the 13C-choline labeling
experiment showed induction of ChoKa protein expression up
to 260%  45% (n ¼ 3, P ¼ 0.018) of controls following exposure
to belinostat (Fig. 3D).
HDAC inhibition with belinostat increases levels of
choline-containing metabolites of HT29 xenografts in
vivo
To assess if any of the metabolic alterations observed in cells
would be translatable to in vivo tumor models, we evaluated
the metabolite proﬁles of HT29 tumor xenografts following
treatment with belinostat.
Following 3 days of treatment, tumor volumes increased by
20%  3% in the vehicle-treated group and 3%  2% in the
belinostat-treated group (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4A). After therapy
cessation, tumor growth inhibition in the belinostat-treated
group became statistically insigniﬁcant relative to controls by
day 7 (Fig. 4A). Western blots of the excised tumors following 3
days of treatment showed increased histone-3 acetylation in
the belinostat-treated group (Fig. 4B), thus conﬁrming the
expected inhibitory effect of belinostat on HDAC in HT29
xenografts.
In vivo 1H MR spectra from a HT29 tumor pre- and postbelinostat treatment are shown in Fig. 4C (left), in which
resonances from tCho and lipids can be observed. A signiﬁcant
increase (169%  25% of post-/pretreatment values, P ¼ 0.02)
in tCho/water ratio was observed in the belinostat-treated
group. The tCho/water ratio did not change signiﬁcantly in the
vehicle-treated group (89%  7% of post-/pretreatment values,
P ¼ 0.26).
In vivo 31P MR spectra from a HT29 tumor pre- and postbelinostat treatment are shown in Fig. 4C (right), in which
resonances from phosphomonoesters (PME), phosphodiesters
(PDE), inorganic phosphate (Pi), a-, b-, g-NTP and phosphocreatine (PCr) can be observed. Signiﬁcant increases in PME/
TotP (total phosphorus signal; P ¼ 0.01) and Pi/TotP ratios
(P ¼ 0.03) were observed post-belinostat treatment (Table 2).
No signiﬁcant change in metabolite ratios was observed in the
vehicle-treated group (Table 3).

In vitro high resolution MRS analyses of HT29 tumor
extracts showed elevated PC (P ¼ 0.04), GPC (P ¼ 0.04), and
free choline (P ¼ 0.01) levels and reduced glucose (P ¼ 0.01) and
formate levels in belinostat-treated HT29 tumor extracts relative to vehicle-treated tumors (Table 4) as detected by 1H
MRS. 31P MRS analysis showed increased PC (P ¼ 0.03) and
GPC (P ¼ 0.05) levels in belinostat-treated tumors (Table 5)
relative to controls, consistent with the in vivo 1H and 31P MRS
changes.

Discussion
HDAC inhibitors are targeted anticancer agents currently
approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and in mid-late stage
trials for other cancers (1, 10, 11). The development of such
agents requires the discovery and validation of biomarkers,
and particularly those that are noninvasive, to monitor target
modulation and aid treatment planning and evaluation.
Imaging of tumor metabolism is a promising approach for
biomarker discovery as it exploits the distinct metabolic
characteristics of the tumor to inform on its behavior following
therapy (17, 20–22). Moreover, studying tumor metabolism
informs on the metabolic pathways modulated by targeted
agents thereby providing a means for investigating potential
mechanisms of action.
Using MRS, we have previously shown that HDAC inhibition
with LAQ824 leads to increased PC levels in HT29 human colon
carcinoma cells in vitro and tumors in vivo (29). The aims of this
study were to (i) conﬁrm this observation with belinostat in
HT29 cells in vitro and in vivo in addition to PC3 human

The clinical development of belinostat is now primarily
directed toward the use of this drug in combination with
chemotherapy. In this study, belinostat served as an alternative
chemotype probe to the agents currently in the clinic. Probe
compounds have considerable value for interrogating the
molecular function of target proteins and the downstream
biological processes they mediate, and for biomarker discovery
and validation (32).
HT29 and PC3 cells were treated in vitro with belinostat at
a concentration and duration that led to target modulation
(shown by histone-3 hyperacetylation) and inhibition of cell
proliferation (shown by SRB assays and cell counts). 31P MRS
metabolic analysis under these conditions indicated that the
most signiﬁcant effect observed in both HT29 and PC3 cells
after 24 hours of treatment was a rise in PC content, which
was time-dependent in HT29 cells. When detectable (in
HT29 cells), GPC levels decreased post-belinostat treatment.
The changes in PC and GPC were conﬁrmed by 1H MRS
which indicated that the tCho signal was also signiﬁcantly
higher following belinostat treatment in both cell lines.
The rise in PC is in line with our previous ﬁndings
with LAQ824 and SAHA in HT29 cells (29) indicating that
it is not inhibitor chemotype-speciﬁc or cell line/tissue typedependent.
Furthermore, belinostat treatment resulted in increased
BCAAs, alanine, and threonine levels in both HT29 and PC3
cells as shown by 1H MRS. These changes were also timedependent in HT29 cells.

Next, we set out to investigate the metabolic processes
underlying the increases in AA and PC levels following HDAC
inhibition. An increase in AAs could reﬂect (i) elevated uptake,
(ii) increased de novo formation from glycolytic intermediates
or other AAs, (iii) increased proteolysis, (iv) decreased utilization (e.g., in protein synthesis), or a combination of the
above.
Measurement of HT29 cell lysates by the BIO-RAD method
revealed a 10% rise in protein content of belinostat-treated
cells relative to controls (data not shown). Therefore, it is
unlikely that the rise in AAs observed here could reﬂect
increased proteolysis or decreased protein synthesis as this
would be expected to reduce the overall cellular protein mass.

To assess whether the AA rise was due to increased synthesis
from glycolytic intermediates, we analyzed the 13C MRS proﬁles of belinostat-treated cells incubated in [1–13C]-glucose for
3 hours. This short incubation time ensured that the 13Clabelled metabolites detected were formed directly from the
13
C-glucose precursor rather than other prelabeled metabolic
intermediates.
This experiment revealed increases in 13C-glucose–derived
13
C-alanine (up to 3-fold) which coincided with decreased
13
C-lactate production by up to 75% of controls. Moreover,
there was a trend toward an increase in cellular 13C-glutamate
and 13C-glucose although neither of these effects was statistically signiﬁcant.

Taken together, these observations suggest that belinostat
treatment led to differential metabolic routing that favors the
conversion of pyruvate to alanine at the expense of lactate
synthesis.
A previous report showed inhibition of glucose transport
concomitant with reduced hexokinase activity following
HDAC inhibition (33). Here, we did not observe a reduction
in 13C-glucose accumulating in the cells, and the combined
level of downstream 13C-intermediates (lactate þ alanine þ
glutamate) formed from 13C-glucose seemed to be comparable
between control and treated cells (Fig. 2A and B). These
observations suggest that glucose uptake was probably unaltered under our experimental conditions although more work
is required to test this hypothesis.
Furthermore, and although neither of the changes in individual content of intracellular 13C-lactate or 13C-glutamate
following belinostat treatment were statistically signiﬁcant,
the [4–13C]-glutamate/[3–13C]-lactate ratio increased by
approximately 3-fold. This effect could suggest an altered
balance between glycolysis and Krebs cycle metabolism as
previously reported (34).
Next, we investigated the basis for the PC rise following
belinostat treatment. PC is formed via 2 main routes: (i) de novo
synthesis through ChoK-catalyzed phosphorylation of its precursor choline and (ii) release from membrane PtdCho via
PtdCho-speciﬁc phospholipase C or release of choline from
PtdCho via phospholipase D followed by ChoK-mediated
phosphorylation (35).
To distinguish these 2 processes, we assessed levels of 13CPC in cells incubated in [1,2–13C]-choline for 3 hours. This
short duration ensured that the 13C-PC observed was formed
de novo from exogenous 13C-choline, thus excluding contribu-

Table 3. In vivo

31

tions from membrane PtdCho-derived PC (because the 13Ccholine would take much longer than 3 hours to be incorporated into PtdCho and then be released again (36).
13
C MRS indicated that the levels of 13C-PC formed were
approximately 1.5-fold higher in belinostat-treated cells relative to controls. The amplitude of this increase is similar to that
observed by 1H and 31P MRS indicating that the elevation in
steady-state PC is driven primarily by increased de novo
synthesis.
To further delineate the molecular processes driving this
effect, we assessed the expression of ChoKa. qRT-PCR
analysis revealed an induction in ChoKa gene expression
in HT29 cells which correlated strongly with the rise in PC
levels measured by MRS and which was also conﬁrmed by
ChoKa protein expression in these cells. A similar increase
in ChoKa expression was also observed in PC3 cells, albeit to
a lesser extent. These ﬁndings point to the induction of
ChoKa expression as a key driver of the rise in PC observed
by MRS following belinostat treatment in both HT29 and
PC3 cells.
PtdCho levels increased by approximately 1.4-fold in belinostat-treated HT29 cells relative to controls, as shown by 1H
MRS, indicating that the de novo formed PC was used to supply
PtdCho synthesis. This ﬁnding concurs with the previously
reported role of HDAC inhibition in inducing the expression of
CTP-PC cytidylyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in
PtdCho biosynthesis (37). Interestingly, levels of GPC, which
is a PtdCho breakdown product, fell post-belinostat treatment
in cells (but not tumors), suggesting that HDAC inhibition
probably also inhibited PtdCho degradation, which together
with activation of the synthetic pathway led to net augmentation in this membrane phospholipid. However, this effect did

not translate to increases in cell volume (90%–110% of control),
suggesting that PtdCho was not used to synthesize new outer
cell membrane, and that it was probably deployed to other
cellular compartments. More work is required to establish the
signiﬁcance of the rise in PtdCho following belinostat treatment, assess the effect of therapy on other lipid species, and
deﬁne the involvement of PtdCho-metabolizing enzymes (e.g.,
phospholipase A2, C, and D) in the MRS changes observed here.
The induction in ChoKa observed following HDAC inhibition and the ensuing increase in PC are unusual and, paradoxically, more commonly associated with malignancy (38).
Indeed ChoKa expression is linked to oncogene activation (39)
and correlates with poor patient prognosis (40). Further studies are required to elucidate the signiﬁcance of the choline
metabolism effects observed here in relation to HDAC inhibitor–induced antitumor activity.
Finally, and to assess whether any of the changes observed
in cancer cells could serve as potential noninvasive biomarkers of HDAC inhibition, we investigated the effect of
belinostat in tumor xenografts derived from the same HT29
cells used in vitro. In vivo 1H MRS revealed increased tCho/
water ratio following belinostat treatment. Although therapy-induced changes in water content can contribute to a rise
in tCho/water, increased PME/TotP was also observed by
in vivo 31P MRS following treatment with belinostat. Furthermore, ex vivo MRS revealed increased PC and GPC levels
in belinostat-treated tumors relative to controls. This indicates that the in vivo MRS-detectable changes are primarily

due to increased PC and GPC content in the drug-treated
group.
The rise in PC concurs with our in vitro cell observations and
with our previous ﬁndings with LAQ824 and SAHA (29),
indicating that this effect is likely to be associated with the
mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors. We also found an
increase in tumor GPC following belinostat treatment, but a
decrease in GPC was observed in belinostat-treated cells and
previously in LAQ824-treated tumor extracts (29).
Interestingly, although HDAC inhibition led to signiﬁcant
increases in cellular AA levels and previously in HT29 tumors in
vivo post-LAQ824 treatment (29), no signiﬁcant effects on AA
content were recorded in the belinostat-treated tumors. The
basis for this difference is unclear and may relate to druginduced physiologic effects that may vary under the different
treatment conditions.
In line with our previous ﬁndings with LAQ824 (29), glucose
concentration fell in the belinostat-treated tumors compared
with controls albeit to a lesser extent compared with LAQ824
(35% vs. 61%). This effect did not correlate with major changes
in tumor bioenergy metabolites as seen with LAQ824 (29). The
differences in bioenergetic effects between the 2 HDAC inhibitors may be due to the additional antivascular effects of
LAQ824 (41).
In summary, we show that the most consistent and reproducible metabolic signature observed following HADC inhibition in cells and in vivo tumors is increased PC levels. Importantly, we show for the ﬁrst time that this effect is driven by

Further studies are required to delineate the precise molecular links between HDAC and ChoKa expression and to
unravel the signiﬁcance of the choline metabolic effects in
