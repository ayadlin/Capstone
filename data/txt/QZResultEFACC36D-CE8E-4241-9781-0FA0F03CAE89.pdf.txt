ABSTRACT
Platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) promotes tumorigenesis, angiogenesis
and metastasis. Here, we defined the PAFR as a yielding new inhibiting target to
selectively enhance the sensitivity of prostate cancer (PCa) cells to radiation. The
selective responding to PAFR inhibiter may be caused by the differential expression
pattern of PAFR in PCa cells. In this study, we also determined PAFR as a molecular
basis by which the radiation induces autophagy suppression independent of activating
mTOR pathway. PAFR can bind to the autophagy-indispensable protein Beclin 1, leading
to the disability in its serine phosphorylation. The PAFR antagonist Ginkgolide B (GB)
can sensitize radiotherapy by disrupting the formation of PAFR/Beclin 1 complex in PC3
and LNCaP cells, which have elevated PAFR expression after radiation exposure. Most
importantly, GB efficiently radiosensitized PC3 and LNCaP tumor xenografts in vivo,
and significantly reduced tumor burden. Overall, our results elucidated a significant
role of GB in selectively improving the outcomes of PCa receiving radiation therapy.

INTRODUCTION

(PAFR) is one of GPCR, which can be activated by PAR.
It has been reported to promote non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) progression and metastasis by initiating forward
feedback loop between PAFR and STAT3 [10], and contributes
to the malignant development of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma by stimulating PI3K/AKT activation [11].
PAFR can also induce chemotherapy resistance in ovarian
cancer through transactivating of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) [12, 13]. In addition, LNCaP and PC-3
cells have been shown to produce PAF endogenously [14].
However, the biologic roles of PAFR in PCa progression and
radioresistance have not been investigated.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of
cancer deaths and the most common cancer in men in the
United States [1], and its morbidity is also rapidly rising
in East Asian [2]. During the PSA era, most PCa can be
diagnosed at an early stage, for which radiotherapy is one of
the standard treatment modalities, alone or combined with
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) [3, 4]. Because of the
side-effect of radiation, limited dose of less than 85 Gy can
be delivered to prostate. However, approximately 10% to
45% PCa are radioresistant either not responding or relapsing
after receiving limited dose irradiation [5–7]. This supports
that an alternative to improving efficacy of radiation would
be to use radiation-sensitizer not to increase radiation dose.
G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is a large family of
cell-surface proteins [8, 9]. The abnormal expression of GPCR
or aberrant activation by their ligands would initiate their
signaling networks and PCa progression and resistance to anticancer treatments. Platelet-activating factor (PAR) receptor

a androgen-dependent and lowly metastatic prostate
adenocarcinoma cell lines. We measured cell-killing effects
of ionizing radiation in PCa cells by examining colonyforming ability (Clonogenic survival assay). PC3 cells were
treated with a series of concentrations of PAFR antagonist,
Ginkgolide B (GB), post sham (Ctrl) and genuine
irradiation. As shown in Figure 1A, it seems that GB did not
show any suppressive activity against PC3 cells. However,
it sensitized PC3 cells to irradiation (6 Gy) in manner of
dose dependent, approximately reaching a maximum at
100μM of treatment. At this concentration, GB significantly
enhanced cell-killing effects of radiation in both PC3 and
LNCaP cells, resulting in significant decrease in surviving
fraction at 6 Gy of X-ray (Figure 1B and 1C).

proliferative marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) (Figure 2A). As shown in Figure 2B, combination
therapy of radiation with GB induced more apoptosis and
weakened proliferation compared to radiation monotherapy
(Figure 2B). Consistent with these observations, there was
a statistically significant increase in caspase 3 activity in
cells treated with X-ray (P < 0.05), and the most increase
was observed in the groups received combination therapy
when compared with sham and GB treatment (P < 0.05,
Figure 2C). In addition, cell cycle assay was conducted
by flow cytometry, results showed that GB reduced cells
in G2/M and S stages (Figure 2D). It is worth to note that
treatment of GB alone in the culture medium failed to
induce cellular apoptotic death (Figure 2B–2D).

To additionally confirm that the GB-induced

PAFR expressions before and after 6 Gy of X-ray are
detected by western blot and RT-PCR analyses. Here,
we confirm that PAFR is almost not expressed in

unirradiated prostate cells and differentially expressed in
irradiated prostate cells, showing that PAFR significantly
overexpressed in X-ray exposed PC3 and LNCaP cells, but
not in irradiated DU-145 and RWPE-1 (a non-oncogenic
prostate epithelial cell line) (Figure 3A). mRNA levels of
PAFR correlated with its protein levels (Figure 3B). As
expected, GB fails to induce radiosensitization in DU145
cells because of little expression of PAFR after irradiation
(Figure 3C). Stable PAFR overexpression makes DU145
cells (DU145-PAFR) resistant to radiation, and the effect of
overexpressed PAFR mostly offseted by GB. To additionally
validate the effect of GB on radiosensitization are mediated
by PAFR, we stably knockdown PAFR in PC3 cells.
Results in Figure 3D and 3E show that GB no longer induce
radiosensitization in PAFR-silenced PC3 (PC3-shPAFR)
cells. Moreover, Figure 3F and 3G show that GB don’t
further increase the apoptosis and reduce the proliferation of
DU-145 and PC3-shPAFR caused by X-ray. At the last, we
overexpress PAFR in DU145 cells, Whereas, In my opinion,
the authors should use DU145 cell line to overexpress PAFR
and show that makes cells resistant to radiation.

To test the hypothesis that GB can enhance the
sensitivity of PCa to irradiation in vivo, the subcutaneous
PC3 tumor models are used. The schemas outlining
in vivo experiments are presented in Figure 4A and 4C,
and results can be found in Figure 4B and 4D.In the first
experiment, mice are randomized 5 days postinoculation
and the drug treatment and/or irradiation are started
immediately thereafter (Figure 4A). For the second
experiment, mice are randomized 4 weeks postinoculation
and the drug treatment and/or irradiation are the same
as the first experiment (Figure 4C). Both Figure 4B
and Figure 4D show that GB alone has no significant
effect on suppression of PC3 xenografts. Irradiation
alone is partially efficacious, whereas the combined
treatment (X-ray plus GB) shows the most protuberant
effect, significantly reducing tumor growth (vs. X-ray
alone, P < 0.01).

Irradiation-induced increasement in PAFR
inhibits Beclin 1 phosphorylation and autophagy

[17–19]. To further evaluate whether the activation
of mTOR pathway is involved in irradiation-induced
autophagy suppression, we used ATP-competitive
inhibitor of mTOR, Torin 1 [20]. PC3 cells receive either
GB or Torin 1, which requires 72 hours of radiation
treatment for PAFR and mTOR pathway activation.
Serine phosphorylation of Beclin 1 and the following
autophagy is weakly increased by Torin 1 in X-ray
treated PC3, as shown by accumulation of LC3B and
reduction of P62 (Figure 5D). Beclin-1, mammalian
homolog of yeast Atg6, is required for the autophagy
induction. The effectiveness of Torin 1 is confirmed
by suppressed phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and ULK1,
downstream proteins of mTOR kinase. However,
a significant increase of autophagy is observed in
cells received treatment of both radiation and GB
(Figure 5D). In addition, GB results in the suppression
the formation of PAFR/Beclin 1 complex (Figure 5E).
More importantly, we find that PAFR can only bind
to non-phosphorylated Beclin 1 (Figure 5E). These
results remind us that increased PAFR may impede
phosphorylation of Beclin 1 via directly binding to it.

To explore the potential mechanism of PAFR-induced
radioresistance in PCa cells, we test autophagosome
formation in a continuous time in scramble or PAFR shRNA
stably transfected PC3 cells (PC3-shScr or PC3-shPAFR)
after radiation exposure. Treatment of PC3-shPAFR cells
with radiation results in a persistent increase in autophagy
within 96 hours, whereas a transient rising is found in PC3shScr cells, as shown by the LC3B protein accumulation
(Figure 5A and 5B). To confirm the effects of radiation and
GB on autophagosome formation in vivo, we used xenograft
tumors from NOD-SCID mice mentioned in Figure 4B. All
tumors were harvested at 6-week post implantation. X-ray
exposure resulted in less autophagy induction, as evidenced
by an decrease in LC3B expression (Figure 5C). GB
combined with radiation significantly promoted autophagy
induction, whereas GB alone failed to do (Figure 5C).
During serum starvation, autophagy can be
induced by inhibiting the protein mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR), a nutrient-responsive kinase

DISCUSSION

block radiation-induced P62 expression and remarkably
reduce radiation-induced Beclin 1 serine phosphorylation
and autophagosome formation (Figure 5D). The
phosphorylated Beclin 1 plays an essential role in autophagy
through forming complex with VPS34 and cross talking
with various autophagy stimulatory or inhibitory molecules
[24]. Although it has been known that activation of some
cell surface GPCRs (e.g. T1R1/T1R3) suppresses autophagy
via interfering mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) [25, 26], the expounded mechanism may not
be applicable to all GPCRs. In this study, we demonstrate
the elevated PAFR can bind to Beclin 1, impeding its serine
phosphorylation and inactivation. Importantly, the effect
only occurs in cells expressing PAFR after irradiation
exposure.
Previous studies are conflicting in the effect of
autophagy manipulation on radiosensitivity [27–29].
Causes for the conflicts may be including but not
limited to (1) the different time of detecting autophagy
post irradiation, (2) the use of cells with elevated PAFR
expression after irradiation rather than that without
alteration of PAFR expression in response to radiation,
(3) the utilize of cell proliferation assays base upon
mitochondrial activity rather than cell clonogenic survival
assay base on directly detecting cell growth to determine
the effect of autophagy induction on PCa cell survival.
Moreover, a sequence of evidences support our results:

The high expression of PAFR and the corresponding
ligand PAF results in the invasion and metastasis of
colorectal cancer and NSCLC [10, 21]. Besides, several
studies have shown that PAFR antagonists can reduce
tumor metastasis in vivo [10, 21–23]. In addition, the
upregulation of PAFR contributes to cisplatin resistance
in ovarian cancer via activating PI3K and ERK pathways
that lies downstream of activated PAFR [13]. Co-treatment
with Ginkgolide B and cisplatin can markedly reduce
tumor growth in an in vivo model of ovarian cancer [13].
However, it’s unclear if PAFR leads to anticancer resistance
in PCa. In this study, we demonstrate that PAFR inhibition
can selectively enhances the sensitivity of radiotherapy in
PCa cells with elevated PAFR expression after irradiation
exposure. Mechanisms of PAFR-inhibition mediated
sensitization to radiotherapy includes the weakness of
proliferation, disruption of cell-cycle and the enhancement
of radiation induced apoptosis. More importantly, our
data clearly demonstrate that blocking PAFR using GB
wouldn’t disturb proliferation and cell-cycle movement
in cancer cells growing in conditions without radiation
exposure. This indicates the weak side-effect of PAFR
inhibitor as an assistant medicine of radiotherapy.
Even though GB has few effect on cell growth of
X-ray untreated PC3 and LNCaP cells, it can completely

(1) several lines proofs indicate that decreased Beclin 1
expression or activation results in tumor development
[20,   30, 31]: Disable Mutant Beclin 1 can lead to
autophagy suppression, anchorage-independent cell
growth and enhance Akt-driven carcinogenesis. In vivo,
allelic loss of Beclin 1 results in increment in the incidence
of spontaneous malignancies in transgenic mice. In
addition, xenograft NSCLCs formed by cells with mutated
inactive form of Beclin 1 are resistant to both EGFR
inhibitor and chemotherapy. (2) As a proverbial growth
factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates cell

growth, proliferation, and differentiation by binding to its
receptor EGFR [32]. Meanwhile, activated EGFR by EGF
impedes the function of Beclin 1 and inhibits autophagy
induction [20]. (3) Through activating ATG1 kinase,
mTOR restrains autophagy induction [33]. As one of the
conserved kinases, it can simultaneously promote cell
growth by activating a series of metabolic pathways and
by inhibiting catabolic pathways [34]. Besides autophagy,
other membrane-trafficking functions are also depend on
Beclin 1, so we can’t affirmatively claim that autophagy
suppression rather than other destruction of membrane-

trafficking events contributes to tumor growth. However,
we did observe decreased cell viability and increased
cell death in PCa with boosted autophagy, increased
cell viability and decreased cell death with suppressed
autophagy. All of these evidences support our conclusion
that autophagy is negatively correlated with tumor growth
at least in some defined conditions. Together, our data
suggest that (1) inhibition of PAFR selectively enhances
the sensitivity of PCa cells to radiation, and (2) autophagy
induction contributes to irradiation responses in PCa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blot analysis

Cell lines and reagents

Immunoblotting was conducted as described
previously [16]. In brief, cells were lysed in Radio
Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer and
subjected to electrophoresis in 10% Bis-Tris Gel,
transferred to PVDF membranes. Then, the protein
expression were identified by indicated antibodies and
ECL reagent (Thermo Scientiﬁc).

Monolayer cells with logarithmic growth were
exposed to 6 Gy (or other doses) of X-ray at ambient
temperature. The control groups received sham treatment
without irradiation. Radiation were delivered using a
220 kV X-ray irradiator at a dose rate of 2–3 Gy/min.
After irradiation, the cells were immediately lysed for
subsequent experiments or returned to thermostatic
incubator for incubation.

The cell lines PC3, LNCaP, DU145 and RWPE-1
were obtained from the China Center of ATCC (Wuhan,
China). Ginkgolide B (GB) was purchased from Selleck
(S1343). Antibodies specific for PAFR, PARP and PCNA
were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Antibodies
specific for activated caspase 3, LC3B, Beclin-1,
phosphorylated Beclin 1 at Ser93 (p-Beclin 1), 4E-BP1,
phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at Ser65 (p-4E-BP1), ULK1 and
phosphorylated ULK1 at ser757 (p-ULK1) were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).

were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)
except where otherwise indicated.

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
We extracted RNA using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen)
and generated cDNA with the Transcriptor First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). qPCR was conducted
using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. PAFR mRNA
expression was quantified and normalized to GAPDH.

Cell culture and transfection
PC3, LNCaP and DU145 were maintained in RPMI
1640 (Gibco, Shanghai) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Melbourne) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. RWPE-1 were maintained in Keratinocyte
Serum Free Medium (K-SFM, Gibco, USA) supplemented
with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. stable transfected cell
line (PC3-shPAFR) was generated by transfection of psiLVRU6MP-PAFR followed by sequential selection with
1 μmol/ml puromycin. Plasmid transfection was conducted
using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen).

Caspase 3 activity assay
The activity of caspase 3 was measured by
using the caspase 3 activity kit (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, China) according to the kit instructions.

Cell cycle flow cytometry assay
Cells were fixed (70% ethanol), centrifuged (1,000g)
and resuspended in PBS containing 0.05 mg/mL RNase
A, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After
incubation, the cells were rinsed three times and stained
with 10 mg/ml propidium iodide followed by filtration
with a 60-μm mesh. Then, 1 × 104 cells were counted and
analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Company)
with ModFit software (Verity Software House, Inc.).

Clonogenic survival assay
The experiments were conducted as described
previously [15]. In brief, Cells received treatment with
irradiation (or sham treatment) and PAFR inhibitor
Ginkgolide B (or control vehicle). After irradiation, cells
were trypsinized and resuspended in pre-warmed fresh
medium containing 100 μM GB (or control treatment),
counted and 5 × 105 cells were plated into 2 cm2 culture
dishes. After one to two weeks incubation, colonies with
more than 50 cells were counted. The results were fitted
to non-line dose-response profiles and normalized by the
effects of drug treatment alone.
