Abstract
Future curative cancer chemotherapies have to overcome tumor
cell heterogeneity and plasticity. To test the hypothesis that the
tumor suppressor maspin may reduce microenvironment-dependent prostate tumor cell plasticity and thereby modulate drug
sensitivity, we established a new schematic combination of twodimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), and suspension cultures to enrich prostate cancer cell subpopulations with distinct
differentiation potentials. We report here that depending on the
level of maspin expression, tumor cells in suspension and 3D
collagen I manifest the phenotypes of stem-like and dormant
tumor cell populations, respectively. In suspension, the surviving
maspin-expressing tumor cells lost the self-renewal capacity,
underwent senescence, lost the ability to dedifferentiate in vitro,
and failed to generate tumors in vivo. Maspin-nonexpressing
tumor cells that survived the suspension culture in compact

tumorspheres displayed a higher level of stem cell marker expression, maintained the self-renewal capacity, formed tumorspheres
in 3D matrices in vitro, and were tumorigenic in vivo. The drug
sensitivities of the distinct cell subpopulations depend on the
drug target and the differentiation state of the cells. In 2D,
docetaxel, MS275, and salinomycin were all cytotoxic. In suspension, while MS275 and salinomycin were toxic, docetaxel showed
no effect. Interestingly, cells adapted to 3D collagen I were only
responsive to salinomycin. Maspin expression correlated with
higher sensitivity to MS275 in both 2D and suspension and
to salinomycin in 2D and 3D collagen I. Our data suggest
that maspin reduces prostate tumor cell plasticity and enhances
tumor sensitivity to salinomycin, which may hold promise
in overcoming tumor cell heterogeneity and plasticity. Cancer Res;

geneity (3–5). To overcome this challenge, we need to better
understand the underlying mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity.
To this end, the drug sensitivity and resistance is thought to be, at
least in part, due to a small population of cancer stem cells (6–9)
that are capable of self-renewal and undergo plastic phenotypical
changes in response to changes of microenvironments (10–12).
Epigenetic reprogramming has been shown to determine the
speciﬁc lineages of tumor cell dedifferentiation (13). The precise
histone acetylation that is commonly dysregulated in the progression of many types of cancer may control the hierarchical
order of epigenetic changes (14).
We have previously shown that maspin, a 42-kDa tumorsuppressive endogenous histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 inhibitor
(15, 16), plays a predominant role in the maintenance of the
epigenetic program for differentiation (17, 18). Consistently,
accumulated experimental evidence showed that maspin exerts
multifaceted tumor-suppressive effects, including reduces tumor
cell–associated uPA:uPAR activity (19, 20), blocks tumor cells
detachment from established contacts with the extracellular
matrix (21), inhibits tumor cell motility and invasion in vitro
(17, 22), and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft
(18) or syngeneic tumor models (23–25). Ectopic expression of
maspin in prostate tumor cells was sufﬁcient to drive the full
spectrum of progressive changes leading to acini formation in
three-dimensional (3D) collagen I (17) and in a xenograft model
for prostate tumor bone metastasis (18). It is important to note
that maspin also enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to apoptosis-inducing drugs (26–28). Consistently, clinical evidence

Prostate cancer is the most frequently noncutaneous diagnosed
tumor and the second leading cause of death among American
men (1). Although patients with prostate cancer are initially
responsive to androgen deprivation therapy, 80% to 90% of the
patients ultimately develop recurrent metastatic castration-resistant tumors. While the number of treatment options has increased
signiﬁcantly over the years (2), a challenge in prostate cancer
treatment is the partial drug response due to tumor cell hetero1

Maspin in Tumor Cell Plasticity and Drug Sensitivity

demonstrated the correlation of maspin with better differentiated
phenotypes and better prognosis (29).
To test the hypothesis that maspin may control the state of
differentiation and dictate the drug sensitivity of prostate tumor
cells, we characterized the effects of maspin on prostate tumor cell
stemness, differentiation lineage, and drug sensitivity in twodimensional (2D), 3D, and in the tumorsphere assay suspension
culture systems. Our results demonstrate that different microenvironments selectively enriched subpopulations of prostate
tumor cells whose distinct phenotypes could be stratiﬁed on the
basis of maspin expression. Although no single drug was sufﬁcient
to effectively eliminate all tumor cells that survive and thrive in
different microenvironments, our data point to a novel scheme
that may accelerate rational drug screening to target the full
spectrum of tumor cell plasticity.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell culture
Reagents used were B27 supplement (Life Technologies), Accumax cell detachment solution (EMD Millipore), Cultrex rat collagen I (Trevigen), Matrigel (Corning Incorporated), X-Gal (Promega), collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum), docetaxel,
MS275, rapamycin, salinomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and Hoechst
33342 (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies). The antibodies
used were LC3B (Cell Signaling Technology, 2775S), PARP
(Abcam, 96476), and GAPDH (Abcam, 9484). Embedded cell
culture in 3D collagen I or Matrigel was performed as described
previously (17).
The immortalized human normal prostate epithelial cells
CRL2221 and the human prostate carcinoma cell lines DU145,
PC3, and LNCaP were supplied from ATCC and were cultured
as described (21, 30). LNCaP C4-2B, derived from LNCaP cells
as described (31), was generously provided by Dr. L.K. Chung
(Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA). DU145 cells
stable transfected with maspin (M7) or empty vector (Neo)
were generated and cultured as described (30). Maspin in PC3
cells was knocked down by transfection with a shRNA against
maspin (PC32D3) as described (32). A PC3 clone transfected
with an shRNA with a scrambled sequence (PC3scr) was used as
a control (32). These cells were maintained in RPMI-1640
medium containing 5% FBS and 30 mg/mL of hygromycin.
Homozygous and heterozygous mouse prostate epithelial cells
derived from mice harboring a speciﬁc deletion of PTEN in the
mouse prostate epithelium (PTEN/ and PTENþ/, respectively; refs. 33, 34) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5%
FBS, L-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin;
ref. 35).
Suspension cell culture
Cells harvested from the maintenance culture were seeded in
6-well ultra-low adherence plates (Costar, Corning), at a density of 2,000 cells/mL/well, in 2.5 mL of serum-free RPMI-1640
supplemented with 2% B27, L-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). Cell viability was measured with the
WST-1 reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fraction of viable cells in the total cellular particulate
determined with the Coulter Z1 particle counter (Beckman
Coulter) was calculated on the basis of a working standard
curve of viability versus the number of cells in maintenance
culture.

Fluorescence nuclear staining and confocal imaging
Cells in 3D collagen I or in suspension were stained with
Hoechst dye (0.1 mg/mL). Confocal imaging of the cells was
performed using the Zeiss LSM 510 and 780 confocal microscopes, both equipped with dipping lenses (20 and 40).
Detection of senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity
with X-gal staining
Cells grown in suspension were transferred to 15-mL conical
tubes, centrifuged, dispersed with Accumax, and ﬁxed with a
freshly prepared solution of PBS containing 2% formaldehyde
and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 10 minutes, at room temperature.
The assay was carried out as described (36). The cell suspensions
were transferred to ultra-low attachment 6-well plates and were
incubated overnight at 37 C. The next day, the cells were photographed using a Leica ﬂuorescence microscope at 5 different ﬁelds,
and the proportion of cells exhibiting a medium to dark blue
stain, indicative of senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SAb-gal) activity, was determined by counting the stained and
unstained cells (36).
RNA extraction and mRNA quantiﬁcation by real-time PCR
The RNA from cells grown in suspension was extracted (RNeasy
Mini kit, Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed (iScript cDNA synthesis
kit, Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed as described (20) using a
Bio-Rad iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System and a
Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system from Life
Technologies. The sequences of the primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Normalization of qRT-PCR results was performed using the DDCt method (37).
Imaging ﬂow cytometry
Trypsinized cells cultured in 2D as well as cells in suspension
dispersed with Accumax were stained with the following mouse
anti-human ﬂuorescence-labeled antibodies: CD44-PE-CY7
(eBioscience, 25-0441-82), CD29-APC (BD Pharmigen,
561794), CD133/1 AC133-PE (Miltenyl Biotec, 130-080-801),
and CD166-BV421 (BD Horizon, 562936). Mouse FCR Blocking
Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-093-575) was used for blocking
and unstained cells were used as a control. Imaging ﬂow cytometry was performed on an Amnis ImageStreamX MK II single
camera imaging cytometer (Amnis) equipped with 405 nm, 488
nm, and 642 nm excitation lasers (to acquire ﬂuorescent images of
each label on single cells) and the multimagniﬁcation option.
Polystyrene beads (BD CompBead Plus anti-mouse Ig, k and
CompBead Plus negative control, 51-9006274 and 51-900667,
respectively) were used to establish ﬂuorescence compensation
settings for multicolor ﬂow cytometric analyses. The acquired data
were analyzed using the IDEAS (v6.1, Amnis) and FlowJo
(v10.0.7, FlowJo) software.
In vivo tumorigenicity assay
Cells harvested from the suspension culture on day 12 were
dispersed with Accumax enzyme cocktail, resuspended in 1 mL of
serum-free RPMI-1640 medium, and were injected subcutaneously at 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 cells/mL in the left ﬂanks of
athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories), as described (38). A
group of 6 animals was used per cell dilution. At 100 days after
injection, the animals were sacriﬁced using a CO2 chamber
followed by cervical dislocation.

Drug treatment and drug sensitivity screening
Cells grown to 90% conﬂuency in 2D, suspension, or 3D
collagen I culture were treated with the indicated chemotherapeutic agents for 72 hours. Cells were treated with DMSO in
parallel as the vehicle treatment control. The cells were harvested by trypsinization (for 2D culture), collagenase digestion
(10 units/2 mL/15 min/37 C; for 3D collagen I culture; ref. 17),
and centrifugation followed by Accumax cell detachment (for
tumorspheres in suspension, according to the manufacturer's
instructions). The isolated cells were resuspended in 100 mL
serum-free, phenol red–free RPMI-1640 and transferred to 96well plates. Cell viability was assessed with the WST assay. The
resulting cleaved tetrasolium was quantiﬁed by the increase of
absorbance at 450 nm using a Bio-Rad iMark microplate reader.
The percentage of live cells was plotted versus the concentration
of the drug, and the data were nonlinear least-squares ﬁtted to
the sigmoidal equation:
EðDÞ ¼ E¥ þ

ðE0  E¥ Þ
 HS
1 þ ECD50

ðAÞ

where D is the drug concentration, E(D) is the cell viability (in
percentage), E0 and E¥ are the minimum and maximum of the
response curve, EC50 is the concentration at half-maximal effect,
and HS is a slope parameter analogous to a Hill coefﬁcient (39)
using either Scientist (Micromath) or SigmaPlot (Systat Software
Inc.) software.
Miscellaneous procedures
For statistical analyses, Student t tests were performed for paired
datasets using SigmaPlot software.

Results
Maspin averts human prostate cancer cell stemness
To examine how maspin expression stratiﬁes the self-renewal
competency of stem-like cancer cells, the tumorsphere assay was
performed using four isogenic pairs of cell lines with signiﬁcantly
different levels of maspin expression between the 2 cell lines in
each pair: DU145-derived M7 (moderate level of maspin)/Neo
(undetectable maspin; ref. 30); LNCaP (moderate level of maspin)/LNCaP C4-2B (C4-2B, low level of maspin; ref. 17); PC3scr
(moderate level of maspin)/PC32D3 (low level of maspin; ref. 32);
and mouse prostate cell lines PTENþ/ (high level of maspin)/
PTEN/ (undetectable maspin; Supplementary Fig. S1). Earlier
evidence showed that maspin inhibits HDAC1 activity in DU145derived transfected cells (15). Consistently, in PC32D3 cells,
maspin knockdown led to a signiﬁcant increase of HDAC catalytic
activity (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that this pair of cell
lines supports the biochemical and biologic function of maspin
and therefore can be used as an additional investigation tool. As
shown in Fig. 1A, the cells expressing low maspin (Neo, C4-2B,
PC32D3, and PTEN/) gave rise to tumorspheres. The PTEN/þ
high maspin-expressing cells did not form tumorspheres. The
other 3 cell lines that express higher levels of maspin (M7, LNCaP,
and PC3scr) did not form tumorspheres. Instead, they formed
aggregates. Consistent with this pattern, parental DU145 cells that
do not express maspin formed tumorspheres, whereas immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells CRL2221 that express a
high level of maspin formed aggregates (data not shown).
Using the pair of M7 and Neo cells, we next examined whether
the differences in their tumorsphere-forming capacities were

3972 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

consistent with the differential expression of markers for prostate
stem–like cancer cells: b1-integrin (CD29), CD133, CD166 (40),
a2-integrin, a6-integrin, CD151 (41), and Nanog (42). On the
basis of the qRT-PCR analysis, in the primary tumorspheres
(passage 1), maspin was signiﬁcantly lower (66-fold) in Neo
relative to M7 cells, as expected (Fig. 1B). In addition, signiﬁcantly
higher levels of b1-integrin (2-fold), CD133 (5-fold), CD166 (6fold), and Nanog (3-fold) were observed in Neo relative to M7
cells. In parallel, no signiﬁcant difference was detected in the
expression levels of a2-integrin, a6-integrin and CD151 at the
mRNA level between the two cell lines. After primary tumorspheres (passage 1) were collected, dispersed and grown in
suspension as the tumorspheres of passage two, the expression
of CD133, CD166, and Nanog remained signiﬁcantly higher in
Neo cells than in M7 cells (13-, 14-, and 6-fold, respectively).
Imaging ﬂow cytometry showed that the cell surface expression of
CD166 in both Neo and M7 cells were higher when cultured as
tumorspheres than in 2D culture (Fig. 1C and D) and was more
prominent in the Neo stem cell population than the M7 counterpart. In parallel, the expression levels of CD44 and CD29
decreased signiﬁcantly in both Neo and M7 cells in suspension
relative to the bulk population. The level of surface-expressed
CD133 was below the sensitivity of the detection.
To determine whether the tumorspheres of Neo and M7 cells
had distinct tumorigenicity capacities, cells enriched by the suspension culture were injected subcutaneously by serial dilution in
the ﬂanks of athymic nude mice. As shown in Table 1, none of the
mice injected with M7 cells grew tumors over a 100-day period,
regardless of the number of cells injected. However, two out of six
animals injected with 50,000 Neo cells developed tumors, starting
as early as at day 21.
Maspin expression confers a transient increase of anchorageindependent survival
To further investigate whether maspin expression alters the selfrenewal properties of prostate cancer cells, Neo and M7 cultured
in suspension were collected and passaged consecutively. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the growth kinetics of the Neo cells remained
steady, as the total number of cells was practically unchanged in
between passages for up to seven passages. The number of M7
cells, however, decreased continuously with the passage number,
which indicates that the fraction of surviving cells becomes
continuously smaller. These data indicate that the Neo cells in
tumorsphere inherited the sustaining self-renewal potential,
whereas the anchorage-independent survival of the M7 aggregates
in suspension culture was transient.
Interestingly, despite the eventual loss of self-renewal capacity,
the M7 aggregates in earlier passages appeared to have more cell
counts, as compared with the tumorspheres of Neo cells (Fig. 1A).
Detailed microscopic evaluations revealed that upon ﬁrst-passage
seeding of the cells in the tumorsphere suspension culture, Neo
cells underwent signiﬁcant cell death, leaving a small percentage
of cells uniformly distributed throughout the plate that eventually
gave rise to tumorspheres. In contrast, the aggregates of M7 cells
clustered in the center of the well and were the only cells visible in
the entire well (Fig. 2B). To address whether those cells visible
under the microscope were viable, we quantiﬁed the number of
cells concurrently by two different methods: the total cell count
using the Coulter Z1 particle counter and cell viability using the
WST assay. As shown in Fig. 2C, the numbers of Neo cells
determined by the two methods were in good agreement. It was

noted that the number of live Neo cells dropped by approximately
40% on day 1, suggesting extensive acute cell detachment–
induced apoptosis. In the following 15 days, the cells grew steadily
into solitary tumorspheres, without losing viability, and plateaued after day 15. In comparison, on day 1, M7 cells in
suspension survived in small clusters. In the next 14 days, these
cells expanded, but a concurrent continuous decrease in cell
viability offset the cell growth, resulting in a signiﬁcant slowing
down of the growth kinetics. After day 15, both the total number
and viability of M7 cells decreased signiﬁcantly.
The apparent "survival" advantage of M7 cells in the ﬁrst 14
days of suspension culture did not seem to result from
increased proliferation or decreased apoptosis, as Neo and
M7 cells expressed similar levels of Ki67 (Fig. 1B), and did
not undergo the typical apoptotic cleavage of 116-kDa PARP
to a 89-kDa fragment (Fig. 2D). However, more extensive
autophagy-associated LC3B cleavage (Fig. 2D) was detected in

M7 cells than in Neo cells (Fig. 1B), whereas the two cell lines
expressed LC3B mRNA at similar levels. In addition, SA-b-gal
activity, a marker of senescence, was dramatically increased in
M7 cells (Fig. 2E and F), despite the decrease of SA-b-gal mRNA
in M7 cells relative to Neo cells (Fig. 1B). These data suggest
that M7 cells survived better in suspension culture via the
mechanism of autophagy but eventually lost the renewing
capacity due to senescence.
Maspin exerts distinct effects on the phenotypical plasticity
lineages of different tumor cell subpopulations
The expression of maspin in the maintenance exponential
growth culture gave rise to a better differentiated phenotype
when the cells were subsequently grown in 3D collagen I, the
most abundant extracellular matrix protein in tumor stroma. As
shown in Fig. 3A, all four isogenic pairs of cell lines formed
cobblestone-like organizations, which positively correlated
with maspin expression. This result extends from our earlier
study with DU145-derived transfected cells (17). The 3D cobblestone-like structures differ from the tumorspheres formed by
cells that express lower levels of maspin in the tumorsphere
suspension assay. Judging from the nuclear staining, the former
had hollow lumens aligned by a monolayer of cells, but the

latter were solidly packed with cells without distinct cellular
polarity (Fig. 3B).
To test whether the tumorsphere suspension culture enriched
from the heterogeneous pool of cells in 2D culture constituted a
speciﬁc subpopulation of cells (Fig. 1A) with increased propensity for differentiation, Neo and M7 cells harvested from the
tumorsphere assay were subsequently embedded in 3D collagen I or reconstituted basement membrane, Matrigel. In 3D
collagen I, as shown in Fig. 4, the Neo cells grew into solidly
packed colonies, judging from the ﬂuorescence confocal
microscopy of the nuclei. In parallel, the M7 cells did not
survive. In 3D Matrigel, the suspension culture–enriched Neo
cells formed uniformly packed colonies, whereas the M7 cells
remained aggregated as shown in Fig. 1A. Thus, as compared
with the respective counterparts in exponential growth cultures,
the suspension culture–enriched M7 cells exhibited greatly
diminished survival capacity and phenotypical plasticity,
whereas the Neo cells consistently formed tumorspheres in
two different types of matrices.
Maspin stratiﬁes the drug sensitivity of prostate cancer cell
subpopulations
Taking advantage of the new established scheme that combined the suspension, 2D, and 3D collagen I culture to enrich
distinct cancer cell populations and helped reveal the role of
maspin on tumor cell plasticity, we examined the effects of
maspin on the sensitivity of each of these subpopulations
toward clinical and experimental therapeutic agents that target different cellular mechanisms, including antimitotic agent
docetaxel, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, histone deacetylases
(HDAC) inhibitor MS275, and the potassium ionophore
salinomycin. As summarized in Table 2A and B, the drug
response was dependent on whether the drug targets mitosis
or survival and was further dependent on the differentiation
state of each subpopulation of tumor cells in different
microenvironments.

line of treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer, was
equally toxic to M7 and Neo cells in 2D culture, selectively toxic
to Neo cells, but not M7 cells, in 3D culture and showed no
toxicity to either M7 or Neo cells in suspension culture at concentrations up to 1 mmol/L (Fig. 5A and Table 2A). In parallel,
docetaxel showed no toxicity toward normal immortalized prostate cells (CRL2221) at concentrations up to 400 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The EC50 values obtained with 2D culture of
M7 or Neo cells are in line with other reports (43). Interestingly,
although the heterogeneous M7 and Neo cells in 2D culture had
an apparent higher sensitivity to docetaxel, they were less effectively eliminated (maximally 50%–60%) as compared with the
Neo cells enriched in 3D culture (maximally 90%). Docetaxel
showed no toxicity toward the PC3-derived clones under all
experimental conditions except the maspin knocked down clone
(PC32D3) when embedded in 3D collagen I (Fig. 5B and Table 2).
These results are consistent with the lower proliferative capacity
exhibited by this prostate cancer bone metastasis–derived cell
line.
Salinomycin, an experimental therapeutic agent shown to be
speciﬁcally toxic to stem-like cancer cells (44, 45), exerted toxicity
toward both Neo and M7 cells (Fig. 5A), relative to the CRL2221
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B) under all experimental conditions
tested. Moreover, maspin expression correlated with elevated
sensitivity to the drug in 2D and in 3D collagen I. Interestingly,
salinomycin was most toxic toward the M7 acini in 3D collagen I
and exhibited signiﬁcantly lower toxicity toward Neo and M7 cells
in suspension. Regardless of the differences in the EC50 values,
salinomycin was similarly effective in eliminating tumor cells
(80%–100%) under all 3 conditions. Contrary to the DU145derived cells, in 2D, salinomycin showed no effect on the maspinexpressing PC3 clone (Fig. 5B) and only affected 50% of the

In this study, the schematic combination of 2D, 3D, and
suspension culture enabled us to stratify the original heterogeneous prostate cancer cell populations into distinct subpopulations that were enriched in speciﬁc microenvironments. We
demonstrate that maspin expression averts the transformative
process of stem-like cell generation and drives prostate cancer
cells toward a more epithelial-like phenotype, in a microenvironment-dependent manner. Under suspension conditions, maspin
expression drove the cells into a nonlinear path to cell death (48),
which included initial survival with increased cell–cell adhesion
and clustering, followed by autophagy stress response and senescence. These cells exhibited restricted self-renewal capacity and
reduced plasticity in 3D matrices (collagen I and Matrigel) and
were unable to generate tumors in vivo. In contrast, the totality or
the vast majority of the cells expressing low or no maspin
underwent immediate cell death (anoikis) under these conditions. The surviving cells generated compact tumorspheres that
exhibited unlimited self-renewal capacity, expressed increased
levels of prostate stem cell markers (CD166 and Nanog), were
able to survive embedded in 3D matrices (collagen I and Matrigel)
yielding morphologically identical compact tumorspheres and
generated tumors in vivo. Interestingly and consistent with a
previous report (17), embedding maspin-expressing cells in a
3D collagen I matrix allowed the selection and enrichment of a
subpopulation that exhibits epithelial-like morphology, evidenced by a cobblestone assembly that in 3D is organized in
polarized, hollow lumen acini. The cells expressing low maspin
under these conditions failed to form multicellular structures and
spread instead, protruding the surrounding matrix in all
directions.
Our in vitro and in vivo analyses conﬁrmed the strategy to enrich
the stem-like prostate cancer cells through tumorsphere culture.
To date, despite the evidence that ALDH, CD44 and CD24 showed
promise as stem-like cancer cell markers for some types of cancer
such as breast cancer (49), the markers for prostate stem–like
cancer cells remain controversial (50, 51). Consistent with the
earlier reports that CD166 may speciﬁcally mark prostate cancer
stem–like cells (41), tumorsphere culture speciﬁcally enriched
cells also expressed higher levels of CD166. Interestingly, the level
of CD44 expression actually decreased in this cell population,
when compared with the cells in 2D culture. Other markers tested
did not appear to be speciﬁcally enriched in tumorspheres in this
study. It remains to be further tested whether any combination of
CD166 with other markers may be more speciﬁc for prostate
cancer stem–like cells.
A major impediment to permanently haltering tumor progression in the clinic is the intrinsic or acquired resistance to currently
available therapies (7, 8, 12). It is currently widely accepted that
tumor drug resistance and tumor relapse is due to a small
percentage of cancer cells that exhibit stem-like properties (52).
Our data, however, suggest that surviving cells that reverted to a
more normal-like phenotype may be even more resistant to

currently available therapies. To date, in the clinic, emphasis is
placed in debulking the tumor and a variety of antimitotic drugs
have been approved by the FDA, including docetaxel (53). Currently, docetaxel is the last resort treatment for castration refractory prostate tumors but the results have been disappointing (54–
56). This is consistent with our evidence that docetaxel only

targets a fraction of the highly proliferative cells and is likely to
be ineffective toward subpopulations with diminished proliferative capacity, which encompasses the stem-like cells and the
dedifferentiated quiescent cell subpopulations. However, the
stem-like prostate cancer cell subpopulation was found to be
highly sensitive to the class I HDAC inhibitor MS275. MS275
showed no toxicity toward the normal-like cell subpopulation in
3D collagen I though. Salinomycin was the only drug that targeted
all cell subpopulations albeit with differential potency.
The underlying antitumor mechanisms of action of HDAC
inhibitors and salinomycin remain unclear. Both have been
shown to induce cell death via apoptotic and autophagic pathways (57–59). Moreover, the HDAC inhibitors have also been
shown to induce dedifferentiation and in so doing reduce tumor
growth and metastasis (60). Thus, therapeutic application of these
drugs may promote survival as opposed to cell death. The interplay between maspin and the pathways targeted by MS275 and
salinomycin also requires further investigation. Maspin has been
shown to sensitize cells to drug-induced apoptosis (26–28).
Consistently, maspin sensitized the stem cell subpopulations
to MS275 and salinomycin. Here we show that maspin induces
nonlinear cell death via autophagy and senescence pathways
under suspension conditions. In 3D collagen I, however, maspin
converted poorly differentiated tumor cells to a better differentiated and quiescent phenotype, which has been ascribed to
the regulation of a cluster of genes involved in the homeostasis
of epithelial differentiation due to endogenous and selective
HDAC1 inhibition by maspin (17). Unlike synthetic HDACspeciﬁc inhibitors, however, maspin may also target other serine
protease-like molecules in different subcellular compartments,
leading to better cancer prognosis and inhibition of tumor

invasion and metastasis. Overall, this study highlights the challenges to the application of antitumor therapies in the clinic due
to tumor heterogeneity and plasticity. It also emphasizes the
importance of the tumor microenvironment. On the basis of our
evidence, an effective therapeutic regiment needs to include
drugs that target the sustaining cellular mechanisms of all cell
subpopulations, including the stem-like and the normal-like
quiescent cells. For that to happen, the need for new drugs and
biomarkers cannot be overstated. Our novel drug testing paradigm exposes the pitfalls of using mixtures of cell populations
under stress-free conditions to test drugs and is likely to yield more
reliable preclinical leads with greater translational potential.

Our ﬁnding that maspin stratiﬁes prostate cancer cells into
better differentiated lineages under all our experimental conditions is consistent with the clinical evidence that maspin
correlates with better differentiated tumor morphology and
better cancer prognosis. Of note, maspin has not been found
mutated in cancer and may remain a target of complex transcriptional regulation in different phases of tumor progression.
However, maspin has been recently found to be reexpressed in
breast cancer cells due to activation of the maspin transcription
promoter by myocardin (61). It is intriguing to speculate that
the effect of maspin in tumor cell dedifferentiation in collagen
I may be the underlying mechanism for the breast cancer

reversion found at the sites of distal metastasis (62). Further
supported by the current study, maspin may be used as a
unique marker to identify prostate tumor cells with different
drug sensitivities in different microenvironments. Future studies are needed to determine how maspin or maspin-controlled
epithelial transcriptome may be intricately balanced to enable
curative treatment of prostate cancer.
