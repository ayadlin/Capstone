Abstract
Resistance to platinum-based therapies arises by multiple mechanisms, including by alterations to cell-cycle
kinases that mediate G2–M phase arrest. In this study, we conducted parallel high-throughput screens for
microRNAs (miRNA) that could restore sensitivity to cisplatin-resistant cells, and we screened for kinases
targeted by miRNAs that mediated cisplatin resistance. Overexpression of the cell-cycle kinases WEE1 and CHK1
occurred commonly in cisplatin-resistant cells. miRNAs in the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family were found to
sensitize cisplatin-resistant cells to apoptosis by targeting WEE1 and CHK1. Loss-of-function and gain-offunction studies showed that miR-15 family members controlled the expression of WEE1 and CHK1. Supporting
these results, we found that in the presence of cisplatin altering expression of miR-16 or related genes altered cell
cycle distribution. Our ﬁndings reveal critical regulation of miRNAs and their cell-cycle–associated kinase targets
in mediating resistance to cisplatin. Cancer Res; 72(22); 5945–55. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)] and its analogs carboplatin and oxaliplatin are used to treat a range of
malignancies including testicular, ovarian, head and neck,
bladder, esophageal, and small cell lung cancer (1–4). Because
of acquired or intrinsic resistance, tumors are not eliminated
by treatment with the notable exception of testicular cancer
(3–5). Cisplatin resistance studied in cultured cancer cells
often results from a cellular defense mechanism that results
in a highly complex pleiotropic phenotype that confers resistance by reducing apoptosis, upregulating DNA damage repair
mechanisms, altering cell-cycle checkpoints, and disrupting
assembly of the cytoskeleton (4). These alterations to the
cytoskeleton disrupt cellular protein trafﬁcking, and redirect
transporters away from the cell surface. This results in cells
that are not only permanently resistant to cisplatin but also
show cross-resistance to other compounds that usually enter
into cells via uptake transporters (such as methotrexate and
toxic metals). The pleiotropic mechanisms underlying cisplat-

in resistance are well described, but poorly understood in their
entirety and in terms of clinical signiﬁcance (4, 6).
In cisplatin resistant (CP-r) cancer cells, cell-cycle mechanisms allow the cell to compensate for drug toxicity (3, 6–8).
When cancer cells are treated with a Pt-based chemotherapeutic, the drug forms Pt-DNA adducts that are generally
believed to be responsible for cell death (4, 9). The lesion
formed is recognized, activating DNA repair or apoptotic
pathways (2, 7, 9). The classic cellular response to cisplatin is
G2 arrest, allowing the cell to repair critical DNA damage before
moving forward with mitosis. Cells that attempt to progress
through G2 without sufﬁcient repair undergo apoptosis
(2, 9, 10). The length of time spent in G2 is therefore dependent
on the extent of DNA platination (11). Entrance into G2 and the
G2–M checkpoint is mediated by kinase-controlled signaling
pathways (12). Multiple kinases have been shown to have an
effect on sensitivity to chemotherapy, in part by regulating cell
cycle checkpoints (13–18).
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding regulatory factors
18 to 25 nucleotides in length. miRNAs affect gene expression
by complementary pairing with the 30 -untranslated region of
mRNAs leading to translational repression, by either degradation or sequestration of mRNA. miRNAs have crucial roles in
diverse biologic processes such as cell differentiation and
phenotypic stabilization, and have also been shown to be
involved in tumor growth and response to chemotherapy
(19–21). The extent of miRNA involvement in cisplatin resistance is not understood, but studies have begun to identify
miRNA-mRNA targets involved in sensitizing or causing resistance, providing potential new targets and mechanisms as
treatment options (21–26).
We hypothesized that miRNAs play a role in mediating
cisplatin resistance through multiple pathways, including regulation of kinases critical to cell–cycle control. To address this

hypothesis, we designed a high-throughput screen with 2
purposes: (1) to identify miRNAs that confer sensitivity to
cisplatin in resistant cells by mimicking miRNA, and (2) to
identify kinases that increase the sensitivity of CP-r cells when
silenced. Kinase hits were validated by siRNA experiments,
examined for expression in cell lines, and tested for involvement in cisplatin resistance with small-molecule kinase inhibitors. miRNA hits from the screen that were predicted to
target kinases identiﬁed by the screen were validated using
loss-of-function/gain-of-function cell survival curves and
Western blots to show a connection between miRNA activity
and kinase regulation. We also tested our screen by selecting a
miRNA that was not identiﬁed in our screen but was predicted
to target the top kinase hit.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
The parental human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB-3-1,
and 2 CP-r sublines, KB-CP.5 and KB-CP20 were used for this
study. KB-CP.5 cells were originally selected in a single step in
0.5 mg cisplatin/mL (1.6 mmol/L) in our laboratory, as described
previously (27, 28). KB-CP20 cells were selected by stepwise
increases to 20 mg of cisplatin/mL of medium (66.7 mmol/L), as
described previously (29, 30). The CP-r cells were maintained in
the presence of cisplatin, but it was removed from growth
medium 3 days before all experiments. All cell lines were grown
as monolayer cultures at 37 C in 5% CO2, using Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/L glucose (Invitrogen), supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin and 10% FBS (BioWhittaker). Cisplatin was purchased
from Sigma. Cross-resistance of CP-r cells to cisplatin is
conﬁrmed on a regular (at least monthly) basis using cell
viability assays as described herein.
High-throughput screen
KB-CP.5 (resistant) cells were screened with both human
kinome siRNA (Ambion SilencerSelect) and human miRNA
mimic (Qiagen) libraries. The kinome library targets 704 genes
with 3 siRNAs per gene arrayed in individual wells of 384 well
plates (see Supplementary Table 2 for a full list of genes
targeted). The miRNA mimic library is based on Sanger miRBase 13.0 and contains 875 mimics (Supplementary Table 3).
For transfection, siRNA or miRNA mimic (0.8 pmol) was spotted
to 384 well plates (Corning 3570) and 0.1 mL of Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Invitrogen) was then added in 20 mL of serum free
media. This mixture was incubated at ambient temperature
for 30 minutes before adding cells (1,200) in 20 mL of DMEM
containing 20% FBS, yielding ﬁnal transfection mixtures with 20
nmol/L siRNA or miRNA mimic. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C before addition of cisplatin or vehicle
only (PBS). Cells were incubated with compound for 72 hours
before assaying cell growth (CellTiter Glo).
All screening plates had a full column (16 wells) of both
negative (Ambion SilencerSelect Negative Control #2) and
positive control (PLK1 siRNA, Ambion, s448, target sequence
AACCAUUAACGAGCUGCUUAA) siRNAs. Positive control
served to assess transfection efﬁciency, whereas the median

5946

value of each plate's negative control column was used to
normalize corresponding sample wells. For vehicle only plates,
negative control wells received PBS alone. For compound
treated plates, negative control wells received cisplatin (EC5 or
EC30) in PBS. Candidate miRNAs were primarily selected by
examining the ratio between the negative control normalized
viability of each mimic in the presence and absence of cisplatin.
Mimics ranking highest in terms of these ratios at both doses of
cisplatin (>2.5 standard deviations from the median ratio
value,  among the top 3%) were prioritized for follow-up
(12 mimics). A similar approach was used to select the top
kinases, focusing on those with multiple siRNAs among the top
actives at both doses (>2.5 standard deviations from the
median,  among the top 3%). Genes selected at both doses
included ATR, CHEK1, and WEE1. Six additional siRNA
sequences (Qiagen) were tested for each of the top genes in
the context of a cisplatin dose response (1,000 mmol/L to 0
mmol/L; details of siRNAs in Supplementary Materials and
Methods). Knockdown by additional siRNAs was conﬁrmed by
RT-PCR.
Small-molecule kinase inhibitors
Cells were treated with the following kinase inhibitors: SB
218070 against Chk1, MK 1775 against Wee1, and PD 407824
against Wee1 and Chk1 (Tocris Bioscience).
MTT assay
Cell survival was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were
seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates and
incubated at 37 C in humidiﬁed 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Serially
diluted cisplatin was added to give the intended ﬁnal concentrations. Cells were then incubated an additional 72 hours, and
the MTT assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Molecular Probes). Absorbance values were
determined at 570 nm on a Spectra Max 250 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). All MTT assays were performed 3
times in triplicate. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values were deﬁned as the drug concentrations required to
reduce cellular proliferation to 50% of the untreated control
well and are reported here as such.
Flow cytometry for apoptosis and cell-cycle analysis
KB-3-1 and KB-CP.5 cells were transfected with siNegative
control, miR-16 mimic, or inhibitor. After 24 hours, KB-3-1 cells
were treated with 5 mmol/L cisplatin and KB-CP.5 cells with 25
mmol/L cisplatin. Cells were harvested in PBS 72 hours postcisplatin treatment. For evaluation of apoptosis vs. viable
populations, cells were washed with PBS and processed with
Alexa Flour 488 annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Alexa
Flour 488 annexin V and PI for ﬂow cytometry, as described by
the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry analysis was
performed with FlowJo v.7.6.4. For cell-cycle analysis, cells were
washed with PBS and ﬁxed overnight in ice-cold 70% ethanol
and stored at 4 C. After 24 hours, cells were centrifuged and
resuspended in 100 U RNAse (Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated at
37 C for 20 minutes. Propidium iodide (Invitrogen) solution
(500 mL, 50 ug/mL in DPBS) was added to each tube and

incubated in the dark at 4 C overnight. Flow cytometry was
performed and analysis was completed with ModFit LT. All
data is in triplicate and presented as a percent mean  SD.
RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and quantitative
real-time-PCR
Cisplatin was removed 72 hours before experiments. RNA
was harvested from KB-3-1 and KB-CP.5 cells using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). RNA integrity and concentration were measured using an NP-1000 Spectrometer to
measure absorbance (Thermo Scientiﬁc). cDNA was prepared
from 20 ng total RNA following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time (RT)-PCR was run using Exiqon probes on a
7,500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, details of
probes in Supplementary Experimental Procedures). The
miRNA data was normalized to U6 RNA. Expression level was
calculated by the ΔΔCt method.
Target prediction
miRNAs predicted to target kinases identiﬁed by the high
throughput screen were identiﬁed by using miRanda (http://
www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do) and TargetScanHuman (http://www.targetscan.org/) algorithms.
Transfection of miRNA mimics and inhibitors
Transfection was performed with RNAiMax (Invitrogen; 2.5
mL/mL). The predesigned miRIDIAN miRNA mimics and inhibitors (details of inhibitors in Supplementary Experimental
Procedures), and AllStars Negative Control (mock; Qiagen)
were plated with cells on day 1 at 10 nmol/L. The transfection
was performed as described by the manufacturer.
Preparation of cell lysates, quantiﬁcation of protein, and
Western blot analysis
Cell samples were obtained by trypsin digestion followed by
2 washes in PBS. Protein was extracted using Cell Extraction
Buffer (Invitrogen) with 50 mL/mL Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined using BioRad Protein Assay based on the Bradford method as per the
manufacturer's instructions. Fifty mg of protein samples were
loaded onto a NuPage 3% to 8% TA gel (Invitrogen) and run at
125 V. Transfer to nitrocellulose membranes was performed
using an iBlot Gel Transfer Device (Invitrogen) at 20 V for
7 minutes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for
1 hour, exposed to primary antibody overnight at 4 C, and
HRP-tagged secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature (antibodies and conditions listed in Supplementary
Experimental Conditions). Blots were incubated with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore)
and developed on Amersham Hyperﬁlm ECL (GE Healthcare).
Statistical analysis
We used GraphPad Prism 5 software for graphs and statistics. All data are expressed as mean  SD. Comparisons among
groups were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Comparisons between different groups were analyzed using 2way ANOVA. P values <0.05 were considered signiﬁcant
differences.

Results
A high-throughput screen identiﬁes miRNA and kinases
that can sensitize cell lines to cisplatin
We developed a high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify
miRNAs that when mimicked (increasing abundance) could
sensitize CP-r KB-CP.5 cells to cisplatin (Supplementary Fig.
S1). KB-CP.5 cells were screened with miRNA mimics (Sanger
miRBase 13.0), and then challenged with cisplatin at IC5 (5
mmol/L) and IC30 (25 mmol/L) doses. After 72 hours, cell
viability was determined using a Promega CellTiter-Glo luminescent assay that reports on cell survival based on cellular
ATP levels in each well. Conditions that sensitized the resistant
cells (indicated by low cell number compared with cells
transfected with negative control siRNA) were examined (Supplementary Table S1, available online). Twelve miRNA mimics
were shared among the top hits for both the EC5 and EC30
doses, inducing >2-fold change at the EC30 dose (Table 1,
Supplementary Table S3). Five of these mimics belong to the
miR-15/16/195/424/497 family. This family shares an identical
seed sequence (a 7 nucleotide sequence that complements and
selects target mRNA for sequestering or degradation). miR-161 and miR-424 are part of the family but are matured from the
30 strand of the hairpin loop of the pre-miRNA and therefore are
a perfect complement to the family seed sequence. miR-16
transfection conferred a 5-fold increase in cisplatin sensitivity,
and its family member miR-15a had a 3.4-fold increase providing 2 of the top 3 hits in the primary screen.
As part of the HTS, in parallel we evaluated a kinase library to
determine which kinases had a signiﬁcant effect on cisplatin
resistance in our cell lines. Here, we screened for kinases
that, when silenced, conferred sensitivity to CP-r cells. To

accomplish this, the kinome siRNA (Ambion SilencerSelect,
704 genes, 3 siRNAs per gene) library was run under the same
conditions as those used for the miRNA mimics (CP.5 cells with
2 low toxicity cisplatin doses, IC5 and IC30), with 3 siRNAs being
tested for each kinase. Selected candidates had at least 2 of 3
siRNAs scoring at the top in terms of sensitizing CP-r cells to
cisplatin at both doses (Table 2, Supplementary Table S4). The
3 strongest candidates were WEE1, ATR, and CHEK1.
ATR, WEE1, and CHEK1 expression and function confer
resistance to cisplatin whereas interference by RNAi or
small-molecule inhibitors increases sensitivity
To conﬁrm that the top 3 kinase hits from the screen affect
cisplatin resistance, an additional 6 siRNAs for each gene were
used in a follow-up dose–response validation (Fig. 1). Four
siRNAs against ATR accorded a 3- to 10-fold increase in
sensitivity to cisplatin. Six siRNAs against CHEK1 and 6 against
WEE1 increased sensitivity 2- to 14-fold, indicating that these
kinases play an important role in inhibiting cell killing by
cisplatin (Fig. 1A). Knockdown of additional siRNAs was
conﬁrmed by RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To conﬁrm that ATR, WEE1, and CHK1 are involved in
cisplatin resistance, we examined the expression of ATR,
WEE1, and CHK1 protein in KB-3-1 (sensitive), KB-CP.5 (resistant), and KB-CP20 (highly resistant) cells (Fig. 1B). All 3
kinases showed an increase in expression in the CP-r lines
compared with parental KB-3-1 cells. In addition, KB-CP20
cells showed an increase in expression compared with KBCP.5, indicating that the expression of ATR, WEE1, and CHK1
correlate with the level of cisplatin resistance in each cell line,
although whether the increased protein levels result in greater
activity has not been determined. As ATR was not predicted as
a target for miRNA identiﬁed in our screen, it was not studied
further.
We sought to determine whether inhibiting WEE1 and
CHK1 kinase activity could sensitize resistant lines and modulate resistance. To this end, we evaluated the response of
the KB-3-1 and KB-CP.5 lines to the following small-molecule
kinase inhibitors: MK 1775 (WEE1), PD 407824 (WEE1/CHK1),
and SB 218078 (CHK1; Fig. 1C). All inhibitors showed cytotoxicity towards both the KB-3-1 and KB-CP.5 lines. MK 1775
(WEE1) provided the strongest effect, killing 50% of the cell
population (IC50) at 0.4  0.1 mmol/L irrespective of cell line

5948

Cancer Res; 72(22) November 15, 2012

(Table 3). KB-CP.5 cells showed cross-resistance to SB 218078
(CHK1, KB-3-1 IC50 ¼ 1.7  0.2 mmol/L, KB-CP.5 IC50 ¼ 2.8 
0.2 mmol/L) and PD 407824 (CHK1/WEE1, KB-3-1 IC50 ¼ 2.7 
0.5 mmol/L, KB-CP.5 IC50 ¼ 4.4  0.6 mmol/L).
Next, KB-3-1 and resistant KB-CP.5 cells were examined to
determine whether inhibiting WEE1 or CHK1 sensitized them
to cisplatin treatment. This was achieved by treating cells with
a subtoxic dose of each kinase inhibitor; MK 1775 (Wee1, 100
nmol/L), PD 407824 (WEE1/CHK1, 10 nmol/L), and SB 218078
(CHK1, 10 nmol/L). Kinase inhibitors were used at a subtoxic
dose to ensure the assay identiﬁed cell death dependent on
cisplatin and not the inhibitors themselves. Inhibiting the
function of kinases produced an increased sensitivity to cisplatin, albeit to a lesser degree than occurred with the siRNA
(Fig. 1D), with MK 1775 (WEE1) being the most effective. It may
be that the kinase inhibitors did not fully inhibit kinases at
subtoxic doses, leading to the lesser effect compared with
siRNA. Sensitive KB-3-1 cells showed a greater degree of
sensitization than resistant KB-CP.5 cells (Table 3). This may
be due to the lower expression of WEE1 and CHK1 in KB-3-1
cells, as there is a lower concentration of kinase to inhibit with
an identical dose. We cannot rule out, however, that the CP-r
phenotype restricts cell entry of the kinase inhibitors. These
data indicate that resistance to cisplatin includes increased
expression of kinases responsible for G2–M checkpoint regulation, and inhibiting these same kinases sensitizes CP-r cells.
The CP-r phenotype confers cross-resistance to kinase inhibitors against WEE1 and CHK1.
CHK1 and WEE1 are predicted to be targets of miR-15a/
15b/16/16-1 /424
Using TargetScanHuman and miRanda, online algorithm
programs for the prediction of miRNA targets, we found that
the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family identiﬁed in the miRNA
mimic screen is predicted to target WEE1 and CHEK1, 2 of the
hits provided in the kinome RNAi screen (Table 2). This is
consistent with our hypothesis that a miRNA will downregulate expression of genes associated with cisplatin resistance,
leading to loss of phenotype and increased sensitivity to
cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. S1). We therefore hypothesized
that miR-15a/15b/16/16-1 /424 regulation of CHEK1 and
WEE1 is causative for cisplatin resistance. miR-155 has been
shown previously to target WEE1 kinase (31), but it was not

NOTE: Cells were treated with kinase inhibitors alone to determine a dose shown to kill 50% of the cell population (IC50) and to identify
subtoxic doses. Cell lines were then treated with cisplatin alone or cisplatin with a subtoxic dose of kinase inhibitors. Sensitization is
calculated as the fold-difference between the cisplatin IC50 divided by kinase inhibitor-treated cells. A value >1 signiﬁes an increase in
sensitivity.

expression. miR-155 also showed a decrease in expression in
KB-CP.5 cells (P  0.05) comparable to miR-15a but less than
that of family members miR-15b/16/16-1 /424 . This indicates
that miR-15a/15b/16/16-1 /424 and miR-155 have a lower
expression in KB-3-1 cells consistent with their increased
resistance to cisplatin.
miR-15a/15b/16/16-1 /424 target WEE1 and CHEK1 in
KB-3-1 and KB-CP.5 cell lines
To determine whether manipulation of miRNA affects WEE1
and CHK1 levels, cells were treated with a miRNA mimic or
miRNA inhibitor (siRNA directed against a miRNA precursor)
for individual members of the miR-15a/15b/16/16-1 /424
family, and cell lysates were obtained at 48 hours. Chk1 and
Wee1 expression in response to an increase (mimic) or
decrease (inhibitor) in miRNA were examined by Western
blotting (Fig. 2B–F). All miRNA family members elicited a
decrease in WEE1 and CHK1 levels in response to miRNA
mimics in both cell lines (Fig. 2C, E). KB-3-1 cells transfected
with miRNA inhibitor showed an increase of CHK1 in all samples
(Fig. 2D and F). miR-15a, miR-15b, and miR-16 inhibitors
transfected into KB-3-1 also increased expression of WEE1 (Fig.
2D). KB-CP.5 cells showed increased expression of WEE1 in
response to miR-15a/15b/16/16-1 inhibitors, but did not show
a marked response to miR-424 (Fig. 2F). All miRNA inhibitors
increased the expression of CHK1 in KB-CP.5 cells (Fig. 2F).
miRNA inhibitors confer a marked increase in cisplatin
resistance
Loss-of-function/gain-of-function experiments were completed by transfecting sensitive and resistant cells with siNegative (control), miRNA mimics, or miRNA inhibitors. After 24
hours all samples were challenged with cisplatin (dose gradient
from 100 to 0 mmol/L). miRNA loss of function by treatment
with inhibitor against each miRNA for the miR-15a/15b/16/161 /424 family increased cellular resistance to cisplatin in KB3-1 cells (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S2). This was also
observed for KB-CP.5 cells, although the low expression of
miR-15a/15b/16/16-1 /424 in KB-CP.5 cells (Fig. 2A) means

only minimal additional silencing of WEE1 and CHK1 is
possible. Increasing the expression of miR-15a/15b/16/161 /424 decreases the expression of WEE1 and CHK1 and
results in sensitivity to cisplatin. Cell survival curves show
that all miRNA mimics for the miR-15a/15b/16/16-1 /424
family increase sensitivity to cisplatin for all data points.
Transfection of miR-16-1 (Fig. 3D) and miR-424 (Fig. 3E)
mimics conferred the greatest degree of sensitization. The
effect of miRNA mimics and inhibitors was conﬁrmed by RTPCR (Supplementary Fig. S2), and no off-target effects were
observed for other family members (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Generally, miRNA inhibitors (siRNAs) lowered miRNA expression to undetectable levels, whereas the fold-increase in
miRNA levels after transfection with miRNA mimic was not
as strong. This difference accounts for the lesser effect of
mimics compared with inhibitors.
The MTT assay acts as a measure of cellular proliferation,
but does not give direct insight into whether cell death or arrest
is at play in cells. This is partly because the MTT assay, as well
as other analogous assays, provide insight into total cell
number. The effect of this is that if cellular proliferation is
arrested (which cisplatin is known to do), total cell count
would be diminished without necessarily eliciting a high rate of
cellular apoptosis. We adopted 2 experimental approaches to
show that cisplatin's effects on cell growth was related to loss
of cell viability (apoptosis) and involved cell-cycle arrest, as
has been frequently characterized for cisplatin. For both
approaches, we examined miR-16 as an exemplar of the family
members identiﬁed in this report.
First, we assessed cellular apoptosis induced by cisplatin
with either miR-16 inhibitor or mimic (with appropriate controls) to show whether apoptosis occurs. Cell death was
assessed using the Annexin V apoptosis assay, which detects
both phosphatidylserine levels on the external leaﬂet of the
cell membrane (apoptotic cells, detected by Annexin V), and
cell membrane leakage (permeabilization) indicated by propidium iodide entry (dead cells). We found that, compared with
siNeg þ cisplatin, both KB-3-1 and KB-CP.5 cell lines were
sensitized to cisplatin in the presence of miR-16 mimic

(increased apoptosis and death), and apoptosis and death were
lowered when the cells were transfected with miR-16 inhibitor
(Table 4, Supplementary Figure S5). For example, KB-3-1 cells
treated with 5 mmol/L cisplatin (siNeg as control) for 72 hours
were 81.4  0.3% viable (8.0  0.5% apoptotic, 9.9  2.4% dead).
Cotreatment of cells with cisplatin and miR-16 mimic (downregulation of Wee1/Chk1) resulted in strong sensitization of
cells (19.2  4.2% apoptotic, 60.4  7.3% dead). Conversely,
cotreatment of cells with cisplatin and miR-16 inhibitor (upregulation of Wee1/Chk1) resulted in inhibition of cell death (0.7
 0.5% apoptotic, 2.8  1.2% dead). Similar results were
observed in KB-CP.5 cells treated with a higher concentration
of cisplatin (25 mmol/L, Table 4). The mimic or inhibitor alone
did not have an effect on cell growth compared with negative
control cells.
Next, we assessed the impact of miR-16 inhibitor or mimic
(with appropriate controls) on arrest of cells in the presence of
cisplatin (Table 4, Supplementary Figure S6). We found that in
line with the effects on Wee1 and Chk1 and cell viability
(described above), miR-16 inhibitor in the presence of cisplatin
elevated the proportion of cells in G2 phase (compared with
cisplatin þ siNeg). For example, KB-3-1 cells treated with
cisplatin showed slow transit S phase (as described by Eastman
(2), 82.6  2.9%) and some accumulation in the G2 phase (16.7
 3.4%) compared with control cells (G2 ¼ 5.5  1.9%).
Presence of the miR-16 inhibitor resulted in dramatic arrest

www.aacrjournals.org

in the G2 phase (93.3  0.3%), and loss of S phase accumulation.
KB-CP.5 cells treated with cisplatin alone showed normal S
phase levels, and greater accumulation in G2 phase, when
compared with parental cells, consistent with resistance and
elevated checkpoint kinase expression (Fig. 1B). In CP.5 cells,
miR-16 inhibitor resulted in greater G2 accumulation than
cisplatin alone. Alternatively, the miR-16 mimic lowered the
extent of G2 arrest to a lesser (but signiﬁcant) extent (compared with cisplatin þ siNeg; Table 4). The mimic or inhibitor
alone did not have an effect on cell-cycle distribution.
Interference of miR-155 causes an increase in cisplatin
resistance by silencing WEE1
Gain-of-function transfection experiments with miR-155
mimic in KB-3-1 cells did not sensitize cells to cisplatin. In
KB-CP.5 cells there was a 20% decrease in percent growth when
compared with siNegative treated cells (Fig. 3F). Western blots
show that increasing the level of miR-155 in cell lines with miR155 mimic silences WEE1 to undetectable protein levels (Fig.
2F). Loss-of-function experiments with miR-155 inhibitors
increased resistance signiﬁcantly (Fig. 3F) and restored expression of WEE1 (Fig. 2B). KB-3-1 cells transfected with miR-155
inhibitor were more resistant to cisplatin. This increased resistance was also seen in KB-CP.5 cells transfected with miR-155
inhibitor. These results indicate that the decreased expression of
miR-155 in CP-r cells contributes to increasing the amount of

phenotype.

Discussion
We report here the results of 2 high-throughput screens,
with the principal ﬁnding that a decrease in the miR-15abc/16/
16abc/195/424/497 family mediates resistance to cisplatin in
our model, and identiﬁed their gene targets, the kinases WEE1

and CHK1. This ﬁnding was achieved by developing 2 complementary screens designed to identify kinases whose loss
sensitized cells to cisplatin, and miRNA that, when increased
by mimicking, achieved the same effect.
A total of 875 miRNAs were screened for their ability to
increase sensitivity to low doses of cisplatin when mimicked in
CP-r cells (KB-CP.5). Twelve miRNAs were shared amongst the
top hits at both doses and 5 were from the same family. The
miRNAs selected for further validation were predicted to target
the kinase positive hits from the parallel screen, and all

NOTE: KB-3-1 and KB-CP.5 cells were transfected with siNegative control, miR-16 mimic, or miR-16 inhibitor. After 24 hours, cells were
treated with cisplatin and harvested in PBS 72 hours post–cisplatin treatment. Cells were processed for apoptosis or cell-cycle analysis
as described in Materials and Methods. All data are in triplicate and presented as a percent mean  SD.

miRNAs were conﬁrmed to inﬂuence cisplatin resistance by
sensitizing cells to cisplatin when mimicked. We also examined miR-155, which was not identiﬁed in our screen but has
been shown to target WEE1 (31), in our loss-of-function/gainof-function validation studies. miR-155 did cause an increase in
cisplatin resistance when its expression is decreased. However,
increasing the abundance of miR-155 does very little to
increase sensitivity to cisplatin, accounting for its lack of
detection in our screen. An additional family member, miR497, lay just outside the selection criteria, providing further
support for the importance of this miRNA family in cisplatin
sensitivity. Furthermore, miR-503, with 6 nt of seed sequence
conserved with the 7-nt seed sequence of the miR-15abc/16/
16abc/195/424/497/1907 family was also predicted to target
CHK1.
The miR-15abc/16/16abc/195/424/497/1907 family are
grouped together based on their common seed sequence, and
have been identiﬁed as tumor suppressor miRNAs with
decreased expression, mutations to the coding region, or
absence in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, gastric, lung, and
prostate cancers (22, 24, 33–36). This family has also been
shown to inﬂuence apoptotic pathways and response to chemotherapy by targeting BCL2 in gastric cancer (36). However,
this is the ﬁrst report linking the regulation of WEE1 and CHK1
cell-cycle kinases by the mi-R15abc/16/16abc/195/424/497
family in response to treatment with cisplatin. This leads us
to postulate that increasing the expression of miR-15 family
members could reverse resistance to chemotherapy in multiple
types of cancers.
Although several screens of varying scale have now been
performed in the presence of cisplatin, none have examined the
sensitization of CP-r cells (37). We believe that potential
strategies for resolving cisplatin-based insensitivity is a critical
unmet need in the clinic. Arora and colleagues recently
reported a siRNA screen against kinases that played a role in
the sensitivity of parental (nonresistant) SKOV cells to cisplatin, identifying ATR and CHK1, but not WEE1 (38). ATR, WEE1,

www.aacrjournals.org

and CHK1 are kinases that affect the G2–M checkpoint in the
cell cycle, where cells arrest after exposure to cisplatin (2).
Furthermore, CP-r cells develop prolonged G2 arrest, allowing a
greater capacity for nuclear repair (11), supported by our
ﬁnding that KB CP-r cells show increased expression of ATR,
WEE1, and CHK1. Although G2 arrest occurs in response to
cisplatin, cell death occurs when the cells undergo an abortive
attempt at mitosis after G2 arrest (2). Therefore, abrogating G2
by forcing the cell into mitosis before DNA repair has been
adequately accomplished increases the efﬁcacy of cisplatin.
Decreasing the function or presence of WEE1 and CHK1, for
example with small-molecule inhibitors, accomplishes this
needed abrogation (2, 12, 39). Here we show that this is also
true by increasing miR levels with a mimic.
In response to DNA damage, sensor multiprotein complexes
identify DNA lesions, following which ATR and ATM (cell-cycle
transducer proteins) are activated and signal the downstream
checkpoint kinases (12). One of these checkpoint kinases Chk1,
a serine/threonine kinase, is a housekeeper present in cells
with a normally functioning cell cycle. When signaled by ATR
and ATM in response to DNA damage, CHK1 is activated by
S345 phosphorylation and prevents CDC2 from activating, thus
preventing entry into mitosis (12). CHK1 also phosphorylates
p53 and in conjunction with ATM/ATR stabilizes p53, allowing
for its activation and accumulation, which results in a reversible cell-cycle arrest without requiring de novo protein synthesis (40, 41). CHK1 is critical in modulating the G2–M
checkpoint in the cell cycle when cells respond to DNA
damaging agents (12) and is therefore one of the most important kinase targets related to the treatment of cancer (12, 42).
WEE1 is a tyrosine kinase with a primary function of inactivating CDK1 (encoded by the CDC2 gene) by phosphorylating it,
leading to G2 checkpoint arrest and therefore preventing entry
into mitosis (14, 15). By regulating CDC2 activity, WEE1
determines the length of time spent in G2–M arrest (43).
Abrogation of the G2–M checkpoint by targeting CHK1 and
WEE1 with kinase inhibitors has been shown to sensitize

against CHK1 and WEE1 are already in clinical trials but cells
can develop resistance to the kinase inhibitors. These results
highlight a potential strategy for a single therapeutic intervention targeted towards the multiple kinases that mediate cisplatin sensitivity.
