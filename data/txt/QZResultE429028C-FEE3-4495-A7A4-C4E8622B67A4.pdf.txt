ABSTRACT
Proteasomes play a critical role in the fate of proteins that are involved in
major cellular processes, including signal transduction, gene expression, cell cycle,
replication, differentiation, immune response, cellular response to stress, etc. In
contrast to non-specific degradation by lysosomes, proteasomes are highly selective
and destroy only the proteins that are covalently labelled with small proteins, called
ubiquitins. Importantly, many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and
cancers, are intimately connected to the activity of proteasomes making them an
important pharmacological target. Currently, the vast majority of inhibitors are aimed
at blunting the proteolytic activities of proteasomes. However, recent achievements
in solving structures of proteasomes at very high resolution provided opportunities
to design new classes of small molecules that target other physiologically-important
enzymatic activities of proteasomes, including the de-ubiquitinating one. This
review attempts to catalog the information available to date about novel classes of
proteasome inhibitors that may have important pharmacological ramifications.

prudent to test whether pharmacological inhibition of their
proteolytic activities would affect the survival of tumors.
Indeed, this approach proved successful for the treatment
of aggressive hematopoetic tumors [4, 5]. However, these
drugs do not perform well in solid cancers because of their
high toxicity [6, 7]. This is due to the facts that, in general,
higher doses of drugs are required to treat solid tumors.
One of the plausible solutions to this is a combined
treatment of malignancies with proteasome inhibitors
and genotoxic or proteotoxic drugs. Rationally designed
combinations of such drugs, in principle, should increase
the efficacy of therapy and hence, decrease the dosage of
individual drugs [8–10].
In this review we provide a snapshot of various
aspects of proteasome functioning and biogenesis and
discuss effects of small molecules that target proteasomes
on different levels of their functioning. Finally, the effect
of combined treatment with proteasome inhibitors and
other anti-cancer drugs is discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Importance of proteasomes as pharmacological
targets
One of the hallmarks of tumor cells is the loss
of cell cycle checkpoint control. In exchange for
immortality, tumour cells lose the DNA replication
fidelity and hence acquire an increased rate of genomic
mutations. Consequently, transformed cells accumulate
large quantities of misfolded or aberrantly overexpressed
proteins, which may be toxic to cells. To cope with
these problems, tumors cells enhance the expression of
proteasomes to eliminate misfolded proteins. In this
respect, it is, perhaps, not surprising, that several recent
studies have found proteasome components associated
with poly-ribosomes to ensure the tight quality control of
newly synthesized proteins [1–3]. Since tumor cells are
addicted to high levels of proteasomes, it was therefore

hydrolyzing or caspase-like (PGPH or C-L) activity - after
acidic residues [23–25]. Furthermore, the combination
of these two activities allows the proteasome to cleave
peptide bonds both after branched and small neutral amino
acids [23, 26]. Despite being evolutionary conserved the
substrate specificity of β subunits may vary. In response
to exposure of hematopoietic cells to pro-inflammatory
signals such as cytokines, interferon gamma and others
β subunits are substituted by their isoforms (β1i, β2i, and
β5i). Such proteasomes are known as immunoproteasomes
and their substrate specificity is altered relative to normal
proteasomes [27, 28]. Thus, the unique collection of
proteolytic activities provides the proteasome with
versatility of destructing most of the peptide bonds available
in nature.
The major role of the 19S complex is to prepare
the substrate protein for degradation in CP (Figure 1B).
Thus, 19S subunits exert the following functions: bind the
ubiquitinylated substrate; remove the ubiquitin moieties from
the protein; unwind the protein and direct it to the CP for
subsequent proteolytic degradation [12, 19]. Biochemical
studies dissected the RP into two subcomplexes, the ‘base’
and the ‘lid’ [22]. The center of the “base” is organized
by six ATPase subunits Rpt1–6 (regulatory particle triple
A 1–6), which directly contact the CP. They assemble into a
heterohexameric ring formed by three pair of dimers: Rpt1/
Rpt2, Rpt6/Rpt3, and Rpt4/Rpt5. The first two heterodimers
are bound at their tips by two largest subunits of RP, Rpn1
and 2 (regulatory particle non-ATPase 1 and 2), respectively.
Rpn1 provides a docking site for UBL (ubiquitin-like)
domain- and UBA (ubiquitin-associated) - containing
proteins such as Rad23 (radiation sensitive 23) that interact
with various ubiquitinated proteins. Rpn2, in turn, is bound
by another ubiquitin receptor, Rpn13, thus completing the
“base” [11]. Collectively, the functional role of the base
subunits is to recruit ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome
and mediate their local denaturation to facilitate the delivery
to the CP. The “lid” complex consists of nine subunits
Rpn3, and Rpn5–12. Current perception in the field is that
the Rpn4 subunit, at least in yeast, does not stably associate
with the 19S complex, but serves as a transcription factor
orchestrating the expression of all proteasomal subunits.
The main role of the “lid” complex is to de-ubiquitinate the
target protein while translocaing it into the 20S complex
[29]. Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12 form a
horseshoe-like structure with the heterodimer of Rpn8 and
Rpn11 de-ubiquitinase placed in the vicinity of the AAAATPase hexamer. Such organization allows the substrate
protein to be stripped from ubiquitin moieties immediately
before entering into the 20S chamber. The second ubiquitin
receptor, Rpn10, is positioned at the periphery of the lid, near
subunits Rpn8 and Rpn9 [11]. In addition to Rpn11 ubiquitin
hydrolase, which is also a metalloprotease, there are several
other de-ubiquitinating proteins, USP14 (ubiquitin-specific
protease 14) and UCH37 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 37),
which loosely associate with the 19S regulatory particle yet
modulate the trimming of ubiquitins [30].

The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) provides
a tight control of the intracellular protein degradation and
turnover. A simplified scheme of the UPS action is shown in
Figure 1. The mammalian ubiquitination system comprises
several hundred different enzymes, including one E1, ~ 50
E2 and ~ 500 E3 ligases. The latter carry out specific
ubiquitination of their target proteins to direct them to
proteasomes, which are considered as cellular factories
for protein degradation. Ubiquitin ligases as well as
proteasomes localize both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of
eukaryotic cells thus allowing them regulate the fate of a
wide variety of different proteins [11]. Their intracellular
distribution depends on the type of cells and tissues [12].
The functional versatility of proteasomes is defined not only
by their dispersed cellular localization and high abundance
(up to 1% of the total protein), but also by a number of
enzymatic activities associated with them [13, 14]. Besides
the proteolytic activitiy, which probably is the most studied
one, proteasomes also possess with ATPase activity
important both for unfolding the target protein and chromatin
remodeling, RNAse activity, which might help to control
splicing and mRNA expression levels, and de-ubiquitinase
activity, required for stripping off the target protein from
ubiquitins for its subsequent degradation [15–18].

Structural organization of proteasomes
Versatility of proteasome activities is realized by
its complex multisubunit structure (Figure 1B, 1C). The
proteasome, also known as 26S proteasome based on its
Svedberg sedimentation coefficient, is an ATP-dependent
proteolytic complex with approximate molecular weight
of 2.4 MDa. The proteasome consists of a cylindrical 20S
complex (core particle / CP) and one or two regulatory 19S
complexes (regulatory particle/RP) [12, 19] (see below).
The 20S CP is not able to hydrolyze proteins on
its own, but cleaves small peptides and some unfolded
proteins [19]. The 20S complex is shaped as a hollow
cylinder formed by a stack of four rings, each of these
rings consisting of seven different subunits. The two
outer rings are made of the α-type subunits (α1- α7),
which mediate the interaction with the 19S regulatory
complex (Figure 1B). Besides this structural role, α-type
subunits also exhibit endoribonuclease activity [20] and
interact with several ubiquitin ligases and hydrolases
[21]. The latter observations challenge the idea of α-type
subunits carrying out only the structural role within the
proteasome. The two inner rings are composed of the
β-type subunits [22]. Subunits β5, β2 and β1 possess
different proteolytic activities—chymotrypsin-, trypsin- and
caspase-like, respectively. The chymotrypsin-like (CT-L)
activity usually is the strongest one in proteasomes and
cleaves peptide bonds after large hydrophobic amino acid
residues. The trypsin-like activity (TL) provides cleavage
after basic residues, and the peptidyl-glutamyl peptidewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Figure 1: Ubiquitin-related protein degradation by proteasome. A. Shown is a scheme of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System. In

general, target proteins can be covalently modified on lysine residues with one or several small (76 amino acids) proteins, called ubiquitins
(Ub) (shown in red). To be transferred onto the target lysine, Ub needs to be activated first by the Ubiquitin activating enzyme (Е1) by
forming a thio-ester bond with the latter. This reaction requires the energy of ATP. Subsequently, Ub is transferred to one of the Ubiquitin
conjugating enzymes (Е2), followed by an association with a substrate-specific Ubiquitin ligase (Е3) enzyme, which covalently attaches Ub
to the target protein. Importantly, Ubs can modify themselves thus forming poly-Ubs chains. The target protein should be labelled by a chain
of at least four Ub (poly-Ub) to be efficiently recognized by the proteasome for its subsequent degradation. B. A schematic representation
of the proteasomal 19S RP. Critical subunits of the base and the lid are indicated. Rpn10 and Rnp13 ubiquitin receptor subunits are shown
in orange. A substrate protein (yellow) with the ubiquitin moiety (red) is also shown. C. Shown is the schematic structure of the proteasome
and small molecules (blue) that affect its different activities and the assembly. The 19S RP is shown in brown, the 20S CP comprised of
alpha- and beta-type subunits (orange and green, respectively) is also presented. A substrate protein (yellow) modified with ubiquitins (red)
is depicted as well as its products of degradation (yellow fragments).

Additional protein complexes that regulate 20S CP

induce conformational changes in the α-ring of 20S to
open the gate [31]. Importantly, the 11S regulator does
not contain any ATPases and therefore can promote the
degradation of only short peptides but not the full-length
proteins. The expression of the 11S particle is induced
by gamma-interferon (γ-IFN) and often parallels the
expression of the immunoproteasome β subunits. Together,
they are responsible for the generation of peptides that
bind to the major histocompatibility complex [34, 35].
Anothert regulatory particle, signalosome COP9/
CSN (constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome) is

In addition to the 19S regulatory particle, there are
several other protein complexes as well as individual
proteins that activate the 20S particle by opening the
passage to its catalytic chamber. These regulatory particles
include PA28/11S regulator, COP9 and others [31–33].
The 11S regulatory particle is a ring-shaped homoor hetero-heptamer protein complex consisting of the
28 kDa α, β and/or γ-type PA28 subunits. Similar to the
19S complex, the carboxyl termini of PA28 subunits

a 430 kDa complex formed by eight subunits (CSN1–8).
The eight subunits of the CSN share sequence homologies
with the Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12
polypeptides of the 26S proteasome “lid” complex. The
CSN consists of six subunits with PCI (proteasome, COP9
signalosome, initiation factor 3) domains and two subunits
with MPN (Mpr-Pad1-N-terminal) domains. COP9
interacts with cullin-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases and
is necessary for their proper functioning. Also, it can bind
protein kinases and deubiquitinating enzymes to regulate
their degradation [32, 36].
Recently, a hybrid regulatory complex was found in
mammals, which comprises the p97-related double-ring
AAA+ ATPase Cdc48/p97/VAT and COP9. Interestingly,
COP9 serves as a “base” and p97 as a “lid” of the complex,
reminiscent of the structure of the 19S RP. This complex
has been implicated in regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases
RNF8 and RNF168 [37] and exerts pleiotropic biological
functions [38].
Not only complex protein structures modulate the
activity of 20S proteasomes, but also individual proteins
can induce conformational changes in the 20S CP rendering
it active. For example, PA200, a 200 kDa protein of
asymmetrical dome shape, binds to one or both ends of
the 20S CP. It activates hydrolysis of short peptides, but
not of the folded full-length proteins. However, the exact
mechanism of PA200-mediated activation of the 20S CP
is still under investigation. The yeast ortholog of PA200,
Blm10 (former Blm3) was shown to be activated in
response to DNA Damage (DD) and the deletion of Blm10
caused sensitivity to bleomycin, a DD-inducing drug. Taken
together, these facts strongly suggest that the PA200 protein
participates in DNA Damage Response (DDR), possibly
engaging the 20S complex to remove damaged proteins
[39]. In addition, PA200 was reported to mediate maturation
of nuclear proteasomes, since knockout of Blm10 increased
the intracellular level of half-proteasomes [11]. Collectively,
the activity and specificity of the proteasome, besides the
19S RP, may also be regulated by protein modulators
whose availability, in turn, is controlled in a cell type- and
stimulus-specific manner.

accuracy of each step of the proteasome assembly are
regulated by specific chaperones. The assembly of the
outer ring of the 20S CP is nucleated around the α5
subunit bound by the PAC3 homodimer (proteasome
assembly chaperone). Because the latter binds to
the inner part of the α-ring, it sterically hinders the
addition of pro-β-subunits. Another pair of chaperones,
PAC1/2, bind to the α-type subunits and prevents the
premature dimerization of α-rings, which may interfere
with proteasome biogenesis [40]. Upon the formation
of the full-sized α-ring PAC3 and interacting with it
PAC4 chaperones dissociate from the pro-proteasome
[41]. The assembly of the β-ring is facilitated by POMP
(proteasome maturation protein), which prevents
the premature dimerization of precursors containing
incomplete sets of β-subunits [42]. On completion of
the β-ring, POMP is degraded and the two parts of
half-proteasomes dimerize to form an enzymatically
competent 20S CP [for review: 43 and references
therein]. Another chaperone, Ecm29, a conserved
HEAT-like repeat protein, controls the integrity of
RP-CP assemblies [44]. Ecm29 serves as a scaffold
protein that helps to remodel stalled RP-CP particles
into regular enzymes. Following the completion of CP
maturation, Ecm29 is degraded [43].
Thus, the speed and quality of the proteasome
assembly is tightly regulated by chaperones, which may
represent promising pharmacological targets.

MODULATION OF PROTEASOME
ACTIVITY
As mentioned earlier, direct inactivation of 20S
peptidase activities by blocking beta-subunits with
pharmacological compounds often causes resistance due
to mutations in the corresponding subunits [45]. Therefore,
an alternative promising approach is to attenuate the
proteasome activity by interfering with the assembly of the
20S and/or 26S particles. The PAC3 chaperone is essential
for the proper formation of the 20S CP α-ring. To become
physiologically active PAC3 requires homodimerization.
Accordingly, blocking of the PAC3 homodimerization
should result in attenuation of the CP assembly. Such
small molecule inhibitor specific for PAC3 dimerization
was described in [46]. In this study, the authors employed
high-throughput screening (HTS) using an in vitro
protein fragment complementation assay (PCA). This
approach allowed them to identify an inhibitor of PAC3
dimerization - JBIR-22 (Figure 2A). The inhibitor was
specific in vitro and showed cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells
(human cervical carcinoma) with an IC50 value of 68 μM.
Interestingly, this compound was active only when used
for a long period of time (120 hrs), but showed no effect
during the shorter treatment (48 hrs), suggesting that the
assembly of 20S CP is a slow process [46].

Proteasome assembly
Another level of regulation of proteasomal
activity resides in the mechanisms of its assembly.
Assembly of the 26S proteasome is a carefully
regulated complex process. It starts with the formation
of a seven-member α-ring, which serves as a template
for the subsequent addition of precursor β-subunits to
form a “semi-proteasome”. Maturation of the β-subunits
concomitant with dimerization of the two halfproteasomes leads to generation of the 20S particle,
which serves as a platform for further adjoining of
the regulatory particles and the formation of the
biologically active 26S proteasome. The efficacy and

hydrolase (UCH), Otubain protease (OTU), and MachadoJoseph disease protease (MJD) [50]. The differences in
structure between representatives of these two classes
reflect their specificity towards the linkage of polyubiquitins. Thus, the USP familily members (USP14)
specifically recognize the free carboxyl-terminal double
glycine motif of ubiquitin [51]. Accordingly, USP14 trims
off only single ubiquitins, but is not able to remove the
whole chain of ubiquitins from the substrate protein. On
the other hand, UCH37, member of the UCH family,
exhibits preferential specificity for the di-ubiquitin
substrates. Conversly, POH1 can cleave polyubiquitin
chains en bloc from unfolded proteasomal substrates [52].
Importantly, whereas knockdown of POH1 interferes
with the proteasome assembly, depletion of either USP14
or UCH37 alone does not affect or even slightly enhances
protein degradation rates. This suggests that the POH1
enzyme is critical for de-ubiquitination of the majority
of substrate proteins by the proteasome, and USP14 and
UCH37 play more specialized roles. Yet, the combined
depletion of USP14 and UCH37 also inhibits proteasomal
activity, which makes them attractive candidates for
pharmacological intervention [53]. Although no small
molecule inhibitor specific for POH1 has been discovered

One of the major functions of the 19S regulatory
particle (primarily via the POH1/Rpn11 activity) is the
removal of ubiquitins from the target protein before it
enters 20S CP. If de-ubiquitination is blocked then the
protein will not be degraded, because the narrow gateway
to the catalytic chamber does not allow the passage
of ubiquitinated peptides [45]. Thus, pharmacological
inhibition of de-ubiquitinases seems to be another
promising direction to interfere with the activity of
proteasomes. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) play an
important role in many processes, including DNA Damage
response, DNA repair and transcription [47, 48]. They are
also involved in several diseases, such as a hereditary
cancer and neurodegenerations [49].
In general, DUBs can be divided into two classes
according to their structures: metalloproteases and
cysteine proteases. All metalloproteases, including POH1,
contain the Ub-protease domain called JAMM (JAB1/
MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme) [50].
Cysteine proteases are divided into four families:
ubiquitin-specific protease (USP), ubiquitin C-terminal

yet, a novel selective inhibitor of UCHL5 and USP14,
b-AP15, has been developed recently (Figure 2B). b-AP15
was initially found in a course of cellular screening for small
molecules that induce lysosomal apoptosis independently
of the tumor supressor р53 [54]. This compound caused
severe inhibition of the DUB activity (IC50 = 2.1 μM
against Ub-AMC substrate [55]) without affecting the
proteolytic activities of 20S CP [56]. b-AP15 treatment has
been shown to slow down tumor progression in four various
solid-state models in vivo [56]. Furthermore, b-AP15
inhibited proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM) cells
resistant to bortezomib and synergized with suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid, lenalidomide, or dexamethasone [57].
Another compound, copper pyrithione (CuPT)
(Figure  2B), was reported to target both 19S proteasomespecific DUBs, UCH37 and USP14, as well as 20S proteolytic
peptidases. CuPT inhibited tumor growth in vivo and induced
cytotoxicity in vitro and ex vivo [58]. Collectively, these
published results strongly suggest that UCH37 and USP14
are very promising pharmacological targets.
That individual suppression of either UCH37 or
USP14 leads to increased degradation rates makes specific
inhibitors of these enzymes valuable for treatment of certain
neurological conditions where the proteasome activity
is severely attenuated. In agreement with this, a highly
selective inhibitor of USP14, IU1, (Figure 2B) (IC50 of
Ub-AMC hydrolysis by proteasome-bound USP14 is 4.7
± 0.7 μM), enhanced the destruction of several important
proteasome substrates (Tau, TDP-43) involved in the
development of neurodegenerative diseases [59]. IU1
failed to significantly inhibit eight DUBs of human origin
as well as Ub-AMC hydrolysis by proteasomes lacking
USP14, which is attributable to UCH37. In the absence of
proteasomes, USP14 was insensitive to IU1, indicating that
IU1 binds specifically to the activated form of USP14 [59].
Several HTSs of small molecule libraries have also
identified other compounds (HRF-3, piperlongumine and
physalin B (Figure 2B)) that inhibit the UPS at levels
other than the proteasome, probably affecting endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD)
[60]. However, this interesting aspect is beyond the scope
of this review.
Following the approach of indirect targeting
of proteasomes, it can be assumed that blocking the
ubiquitin-binding subunits within the 19S RP should also
yield a significant malfunctioning of the proteasome.
Indeed, recent report that bis-benzylidine piperidone
RA190 (Figure 2B) covalently binds the ubiquitin
receptor RPN13 in the 19S regulatory particle and inhibits
the proteasome function, confirms the validity of this
approach. Importantly, treatment of bortezomib-resistant
MM cells with RA190 triggered rapid accumulation of
polyubiquitinated proteins and cell death via endoplasmic
reticulum stress-related apoptosis [61].
By the same token, targeting of the Rpt/ATPasecontaining “base” of the 19S complex should also
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

represent an attractive pharmacological approach. In line
with this hypothesis is the fact that several low-molecular
inhibitors of the р97/VCP/Cdc48 subunit of the Cdc48/
COP9 regulatory complex have been identified to date [62,
63]. Noteworthy, mammalian AAA+ ATPase р97 (Valosincontaining protein (VCP), Cdc48 at yeast) is also capable
of binding ubiquitin [3]. By means of HTS Chou with
colleagues revealed a selective reversible ATP-competitive
p97 inhibitor - N2, N4-dibenzylquinazoline-2, 4-diamine
/ JRF 12/ DbeQ with IC50 ranging from 1 to 7 μM
depending on the cell type. Importantly, this compound
induces apoptosis of cancer cells faster than the inhibitors
of 20S CP proteolytic activites (e.g. MG132). Further
analyses using structure–activity relationship (SAR) led
to the identification of low molecular weight inhibitors
ML240 (Figure 2B) and ML241, which selectively block
degradation of p97-dependent proteasome substrates with
IC50 = 900 nM and 3500 nM, respectively [62, 63].
Taken these results together, one can predict that
targeting protein-protein intereactions of Rpn1 and Rpn2
with small molecules should also affect the activity of
proteasomes.

Small molecule inhibitors of proteasomal
proteolytic activities
Since regulated proteolysis via proteasomes plays
a key role in a number of pathological processes such as
rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, bacterial and
viral infections, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease, the field
of proteasome inhibitors research has bloomed over the
last decade [6, 64]. A list of various proteasome inhibitors
currently used in biomedicine is shown in Table 1.
The pioneering first-in class proteasome-specific
drug approved by FDA was Bortezomib / PS341 / Velcade®
(Figure 2C). It represents a dipeptidyl boronic acid-based
compound that reversibly inhibits the chymotrypsin-like
activity and to a lesser extent caspase-like activity of the
20S proteasome [90, 91]. Mechanistically, the boronic
acid moiety of bortezomib forms a (pseudo)covalent bond
with the nucleophilic hydroxyl side chain of Thr1 in the
S1 pocket of the β5 subunit [92]. This dipeptidyl boronate
has an IC50CT-L = 2.4–8.2 nM for the 20S CP and 3.3 nM
for 20S associated with the PA28 complex [93–96]. The
drug was approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma,
and mantle cell lymphoma. The spectrum of anti-tumor
activity of bortezomib is quite diverse and includes:
upregulation of proapoptotic proteins (e.g., Noxa, IκB),
inhibition of NFκB and its anti-apoptotic target genes,
suppression of several anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., BclXL, Bcl-2, and STAT-3), down-regulation of expression
of several proteins involved in DNA repair pathways, and
induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and proapoptotic Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Bortezomib
has potent chemo-/radio-sensitizing effects and can

A summary of proteasome inhibitors known to-date grouped by: their origin (synthetic or natural), targeting specificity and
IC50 against the proteasomal enzymatic activities (CT-L stands for ChymoTrypsin-Like, T-L stands for Trypsin-Like and
C-L stands for Caspase-Like activity), and type of assay used for measuring the inhibitory effect. The compounds are also
divided into classes according to their chemical structures (aldehydes, syrbactins, epoxyketones, etc.).
overcome traditional drug resistance in tumors when
used in combination with potential chemotherapies.
Although bortezomib showed great success in treating
hematological malignancies, some patients relapsed
after a positive initial response. Furthermore, bortezomib
was found associated with several cytotoxicities (e.g.
peripheral neuropathy) [97].
These observations have encouraged researchers to
search for the next generation proteasome inhibitors that
could overcome bortezomib resistance and have improved
properties, reduced toxicities, and broader anticancer
activities. The next, much improved, derivative of bortezomib
was Carfilzomib / PR-171 / Kyprolis® (Figure 2C). It was
approved in 2012 by FDA for the treatment of relapsed and
refractory multiple myeloma. Structurally, carfilzomib is a
derivative of epoxyketone, which forms irreversible covalent
bonds with the β5 subunit thus inhibiting the chymotrypsinlike activity (IC50CT-L = 6.0 nM for 20S) [94, 96].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In addition to carfilzomib, several other second
generation proteasome inhibitors have been developed
and are now being actively tested in clinical studies:
marizomib (salinosporamide A) [98], CEP-18770,
MLN-9708 [99, 100] and ONX-0912 [101] (Figure 2C
and Table 2). Marizomib is a natural product derivative
that resembles lactacystin. In contrast to bortezomib
and carfilzomib, marizomib irreversibly binds all three
enzymatically active subunits of the proteasome (β1, β2,
and β5), thus providing a durable and strong inhibition
of both chymotrypsin-like (IC50CT-L = 1.3 − 3.5 nM) and
trypsin-like (IC50T-L = 2.0 – 28 nM) activities [102–105].
Of note, marizomib was able to overcome bortezomib
resistance in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia cell models [106]. This important clinical
property of marizomib could be due to its increased
specificity toward caspase 8-mediated apoptosis compared
to bortezomib [107].

Besides bortezomib and carfilzomib there are two
other reversible peptide boronates proteasome inhibitors,
delanzomib (CEP-18770) and Ixazomib (MLN-9708)
[99, 100]. CEP-18770 (Figure 2C) has been investigated
in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent,
advanced stage solid tumors, lymphoblastic leukemia
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It primarily inhibits
chymotrypsin-like activity with IC50CT-L = 3.4 nM [93].
Ixazomib is also currently being investigated in Phase I
clinical trials for recurrent MM [100, 108]. Furthermore,
oprozomib (ONX-0912) (Figure 2C) is another peptide
epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor, which irreversibly
inhibits chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasomes with
IC50CT-L ~10 nM and is currently in Phase I and II clinical
trials for patients with solid tumors and hematological
cancers [101]. Further clinical studies should define the
anticancer efficacy of these second generation proteasome
inhibitor drugs.
The immunoproteasome (20Si and 26Si) is a
cytokine-inducible form of the proteasome in which β1, β2,
and β5 subunits are replaced with the immunoproteasomespecific β1i, β2i, and β5i subunits, respectively [109].
It has been found that the levels of immunoproteasome
in MM cells vary depending on the current status of
disease. In general, MM cells express increased levels of
immunoproteasome. On the contrary, relapsed myeloma and
bortezomib resistant cells display suppressed levels of the
immunoproteasome and increased levels of the constitutive
proteasome [110]. IPSI-001, an immunoproteasome- β1i
subunit-specific inhibitor, has been found to preferably
inhibit the immunoproteasome 20Si activity over the
constitutive 20S proteasome activity. Treatment of cancer
cells with the IPSI-001 inhibitor promoted apoptotis. Other
IPSIs, PR-924 and PR-957 were able to overcome resistance
to bortezomib in the preclinical setting, suggesting that
they may provide an alternative approach to overcome the
resistance to bortezomib [110, 111].

used to control cancer, for example, lenalidomide,
dexamethasone, and prednisone. In such studies the most
commonly used proteasome inhibitors are bortezomib
(Velcade® and carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) that have already
been approved for clinical use, but other combinations
are also being tested. In particular, xenograft studies
showed promising results for the treatment of MM with
delanzomib combined with immunomodulators [112].
This scheme of treatment is also applicable not only to
MM, but, for example, to prostate cancer [113]. An anticancer effect of proteasome inhibitors is significant even
with the joined application of immunomodulators and
alkylating agents (e.g. prednisone and melphalan) [114].

Proteasome inhibitors in combination with
HDAC inhibitors
Combined therapies based on the proteasome
inhibitors are gaining their momentum in clinical
oncology and have been tested in various hematopoetic
tumors including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [115],
T-cell lymphoma [116], mantle cell lymphoma [117] and
other types of cancer. Among the most popular partners
in combination with proteasome inhibitors to treat the
hematological malignancies are histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors [118]. These inhibitors belong to a
very promising class of epigenetic regulators and are being
actively investigated in conjunction with many drugs,
including not only bortezomib, but also other proteasome
inhibitors, e.g. MG132 and epoxomicin [119]). The
effect of combined therapy of proteasome and histone
deacetylase inhibitors was also investigated on solid
tumors such as prostate cancer [119], operable non-small
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) [120], colorectal cancer [121],
and hepatoma liver cancer [122].

Proteasome inhibitors in combination with HSP90 inhibitors

TREATMENT OF TUMORS WITH
PROTEASOME INHIBITORS COMBINED
WITH OTHER DRUGS

Clinical trials (phase I/II) have demonstrated the
efficacy of combined application of bortezomib with the
inhibitor of heat-shock protein 90 (HSP-90), 17-AAG
[123]. This is first-in-class semi-synthetic analogue of
the natural HSP-90 inhibitor, geldanamycin. Although
17-AAG performed poorly in clinical trials, it displayed
strong inhibitory effect on the expression of IL-6R, IGFIRβ and associated signaling molecules, including the
pro-survival PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [124]. This
suggests that the HSP90 inhibitors have a promising
future in clinics as anti-cancer drugs, pending the
reduction of their cytotoxicity and increased solubility. In
this respect, KW-2478, a novel HSP90 inhibitor, is being
currently investigated in pre-clinical trials. Interestingly,
the combination of KW-2478 together with bortezomib
showed higher efficacy in treatment of MM compared
to the treatment with any of these drugs alone [125].

It should be noticed that, in addition to the
development of more effective and specific inhibitors
of the proteasome, there is another productive strategy
to increase the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy - via
exploration of various combinations of proteasome
inhibitors with other anti-cancer drugs. Below, we mention
several most popular therapeutic combinations that
involve proteasome inhibitors (Table 2).

A  similar effect was observed when bortezomib was
used with an inhibitor of HSF1 (heat shock transcription
factor 1), which transcriptionally controls the expression
of HSP genes, including HSP90 [126].

these antibiotics to inhibit autophagy. Thus, inhibition of
both autophagy and the proteasome activity by Bortezomib
in MM cells results in complete ERAD inhibition and
hence, increased cytotoxicity [133].
All these indicate that the use of combined therapy not
only may significantly extend the range of diseases that are
amenable to therapeutic action of proteasome inhibitors but
also overcomes the problem of resistance in patients due to
the simultaneous intervention of several cellular processes.

Proteasome inhibitors in combination with
kinase inhibitors
It is well established that the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT-mTOR signaling pathway plays an
important role in the survival and tumor chemoresistance
[127]. Accordingly, direct inhibition of the PI3K pathway
in cancer cells causes anti-proliferative and cytotoxic
effect, especially when combined with other drugs. In
line with this notion is the observation that the anti-cancer
efficacy of pan-PI3K inhibitor, SF1126, is augmented in
MM cells when combined with bortezomib or MG132
[128, 129]. Likewise, the LY294002 PI3K inhibitor was
shown to aid overcoming resistance to bortezomib, yet
it did not demonstrate any apoptotic effect when used
as monotherapy [130]. Finally, a multi-kinase inhibitor
sorafenib, which acts similar to LY294002 on a wide
range of different tumors, was shown to synergize
with bortezomib by affecting Akt and JNK signaling
pathways [131]. Collectively, it would be prudent to say
that the combinatorial treatment of cancers with PI3K
and proteasome inhibitors, although in its early stage of
development, has very promising future.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
As cancer cells are more sensitive to proteasome
inhibition than normal cells due to their elevated
proliferation rates and the loss of translation quality
control, the pharmacological targeting of proteasomal
activities provides a new promising avenue for basic and
clinical research. Supporting this notion is the fact that the
clinical efficacy of bortezomib in treating hematopoetic
malignancies has been well established. However, this
preliminary success should be considered with caution.
The majority of patients who initially responded to
chemotherapy with bortezomib eventually became
refractory to the drug, because of the increased rate of
mutations in the target β5 subunit of the proteasome.
This fact is a strong warning that the direct inhibition
of the proteasome-mediated proteolytic activity may be
too mutagenic to be considered as a long-term treatment
of cancer. In this respect, it should be mentioned that
the targeting of non-proteolytic proteasomal activities
(de-ubiquitination and ATP remodeling) and even
interfering with the proteasome assembly with small
molecules may yield a better, more specific therapy, which
will have less side effects. This direction has just only
begun to actively develop.
Another issue of mono-therapy with bortezomib is
its various efficacy depending on the tissue: although it
is very potent in treating hematopoetic malignancies, its
success in solid tumors has been rather limited. Whether
the inert response to bortezomib is an intrinsic property
of solid tumor cells, or this is due to the drug itself is
currently unknown. Nevertheless, there is substantial
evidence that the combination of proteasome inhibitors
with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs help to
overcome drug resistance of solid tumor cells [137].
Bortezomib was also shown to increase radiosensitivity of
cancer cells, which makes the combination of bortezomib
with radiotherapy or radiomimetic drugs a promising
therapeutic tool [138]. Future studies will show the clinical
relevance of bortezomib-based combinatorial therapies.
In sum, development of novel proteasome
inhibitors with various specificities as well as novel drug
combinations should help to address some of the key
issues with bortezomib and offer possibilities for future
anti-cancer therapies.

Proteasome inhibitors and ER stress
The anti-proliferative effect of many drugs is
associated with the induction of endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress, upon which misfolded proteins travel from
the ER back to the cytosol for destruction by proteasomes
in the ubiquitin-dependent manner. The anti-cancer
effect of treatment with HSP-90 inhibitors together with
bortezomib is based on their ability to synergistically
induce ER stress. Surprisingly, ER stress can also be
induced by HIV protease inhibitors, such as nelfinavir
[132], or Calp Inh IV, and PD150606 [133]. The latter
two blunt the activity of calpain and enhance the effects of
proteasome inhibition [134].
It should be noted that resistance of MM cells to
Bortezomib could be explained in part, by incomplete
inactivation of the (ER)-associated protein degradation
(ERAD) system and activation of non-proteasomal
protein degradation pathways. In this respect, it is
important to mention that the direct inducer of ER stress,
eeyarestatin, enhances the cytotoxic effect of bortezomib
on MM cells [135]. Furthermore, macrolide antibiotics,
e.g. concanamycin A, erythromycin, clarithromycin and
azithromycin, which do not exhibit cytotoxicity on their
own, synergize with bortezomib [136]. The molecular
mechanism behind this phenomenon utilizes the ability of
