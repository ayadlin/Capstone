ABSTRACT
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer,
with a 5-year survival <7%. A major barrier to progress is the absence of predictive
biomarkers for chemotherapy and novel targeted agents such as PARP inhibitors. Using
a high-throughput, integrated proteomic, transcriptomic, and genomic analysis of SCLC
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and profiled cell lines, we identified biomarkers
of drug sensitivity and determined their prevalence in patient tumors. In contrast to
breast and ovarian cancer, PARP inhibitor response was not associated with mutations
in homologous recombination (HR) genes (e.g., BRCA1/2) or HRD scores. Instead, we
found several proteomic markers that predicted PDX response, including high levels of
SLFN11 and E-cadherin and low ATM. SLFN11 and E-cadherin were also significantly
associated with in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin and topoisomerase1/2 inhibitors (all
commonly used in SCLC). Treatment with cisplatin or PARP inhibitors downregulated
SLFN11 and E-cadherin, possibly explaining the rapid development of therapeutic
resistance in SCLC. Supporting their functional role, silencing SLFN11 reduced in vitro
sensitivity and drug-induced DNA damage; whereas ATM knockdown or pharmacologic
inhibition enhanced sensitivity. Notably, SCLC with mesenchymal phenotypes (i.e., loss
of E-cadherin and high epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature scores)
displayed striking alterations in expression of miR200 family and key SCLC genes (e.g.,
NEUROD1, ASCL1, ALDH1A1, MYCL1). Thus, SLFN11, EMT, and ATM mediate therapeutic
response in SCLC and warrant further clinical investigation as predictive biomarkers.

by drug resistance [1]. We previously demonstrated that
PARP1 is a promising novel therapeutic target in SCLC
[2, 3] and multiple PARP inhibitor clinical trials have
now been initiated. However, unlike other forms of

lung cancer, there are currently no biomarkers to predict
treatment response in SCLC. In other cancers, response to
PARP inhibitors has been associated with defects in DNA
damage response (DDR) (e.g., mutations in BRCA1/2,
ATM) [4, 5]. However, only ~12% of SCLC tumors
have mutations in DDR genes [6–8] and most of those
mutations do not have a known or predicted deleterious
effect on function [6].
One emerging biomarker for PARP inhibitors and
chemotherapy in several cancers is Schlafen 11 (SLFN11)
[9–11]. We and others have recently described an
association between SLFN11 expression and sensitivity
to various PARP inhibitors, including talazoparib and
olaparib, in SCLC models [12–14]. However, some
models with low levels of SLFN11 respond to PARP
inhibition, whereas others with relatively high levels are
resistant [12, 13]. These findings suggest that SLFN11 is
unlikely to be the only determinant of drug response in
SCLC.
To characterize SCLC-specific biomarkers of
therapeutic vulnerability, we performed a high-throughput,
integrated proteomic, transcriptomic, and genomic
analysis using SCLC PDX models, cell lines, and archival
tumor specimens. We found that while DDR mutations
and HR deficiency (HRD) scores were not predictive in
SCLC, expression levels of several markers including
SLFN11, ATM, and E-cadherin (reflecting epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) status) determined
response to both PARP inhibitors and several classes of
chemotherapy in preclinical models.

beta (FC=-1.73, P=0.045), and IRS1 (FC=-1.39, P=0.025)
protein levels were associated with resistance (Figure 1C).
Protein biomarker results were further validated at the
mRNA level which also showed an association between
talazoparib response and high SLFN11 (FC=38.82,
P=0.031), low ATM (FC=-2.12, P=0.004), and low
CHEK1 (FC=-1.86, P=0.003) expression in PDX models
(Figure 1D). Interestingly, although the two PDXs with
the lowest ATM levels both had partial responses to
talazoparib, only one of these expressed high levels of
SLFN11 (Supplementary Figure 2C). This suggests that
either low ATM or high SLFN11 is sufficient to predict
sensitivity to talazoparib and therefore that more than one
biomarker may predict SCLC response to PARP inhibition.
After SLFN11, E-cadherin (a marker commonly
associated with EMT status) was the next strongest
protein marker correlated with sensitivity (FC=2.24,
P=0.158), although this did not reach statistical
significance possibly due to the small sample size. Given
previous findings by our group and others that EMT
mediates resistance to several targeted therapies in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we further investigated
the association between E-cadherin and talazoparib
sensitivity using an EMT gene expression signature [17].
Consistent with the E-cadherin protein data, we found
that PDX models that were resistant to talazoparib (PD)
were more mesenchymal than those with PR or SD (mean
difference=-2.21, P=0.052) (Figure 1E).
Finally, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC)
on tumors from the vehicle-treated PDXs for the top two
biomarkers (SLFN11 and ATM) to independently validate
the RPPA results (Figure 1F). H-scores for the ATM
and SLFN11 levels were highly correlated with RPPA
measurements (rho = 0.62 [P=0.02] and 0.82 [P=0.0006],
respectively; Supplementary Figure 2D). As expected,
SLFN11 H score was also correlated with PDX sensitivity
(FC=8.639, P=0.03), whereas ATM H score was borderline
significant (FC=-3.446, P=0.09; Figure 1F). This may have
been due to the semi-quantitative nature of IHC compared
with RPPA, which has greater sensitivity at lower protein
expression levels [18]. These results suggest that IHC
for SLFN11 and ATM in patient biopsy specimens could
be a viable method for identifying patients with a higher
likelihood of response to PARP inhibition.

RESULTS
Identification of biomarkers in preclinical SCLC
models
PDX models are derived from direct implantation
of patient tumor biopsies into immunodeficient mice.
PDX models retain both genetic similarities and drug
response to the patient tumor from which they were
developed and are useful for studying both tumor biology
and preclinical testing [15, 16]. SCLC PDX models were
treated with vehicle or talazoparib (PARP inhibitor)
and assigned to response groups, partial response (PR),
stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) based
on tumor growth and percent change from baseline
(Figure 1A; Supplementary Figure 1). Tumors from
untreated (vehicle) PDXs were analyzed by reverse-phase
protein array (RPPA) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq)
to identify pre-treatment protein and mRNA differences
between those that were sensitive (PR or SD) or resistant
(PD) to single-agent talazoparib. Of 170 proteins and/
or phosphorylated proteins quantified by RPPA, low
ATM (FC=-2.32, P=0.009) and high SLFN11 (FC=5.11,
P=0.014) protein expression were the most significantly
associated with talazoparib response in the PDX models
(Figure 1B). High CHK1 (FC=-1.48, P=0.017), IGF1R

Biomarkers from other cancer types do not
predict PARP inhibitor response in SCLC
In other cancers such as ovarian and breast,
mutations in HR genes (e.g., BRCA1/2, ATM) and/
or elevated HRD scores (e.g., Myriad Genetics testing
scores) [19] predict patient response to PARP inhibitors.
We found no association between PDX in vivo sensitivity
to talazoparib and the HRD score (FC=1.081, P=0.748;
Figure 1G). Consistent with this, HRD score also was not
correlated with in vitro response to cisplatin (rho= -0.136,
P=0.674), talazoparib (rho= 0.175, P=0.586) or olaparib

(rho=0.290, P=0.360) (Supplementary Figure 2A) in a
panel of 12 cell lines. We next tested whether the specific
mutations were predictive in SCLC using a commercially
available next-generation sequencing platform that
includes targeted sequencing of 315 cancer-related genes
plus select introns from 28 genes often rearranged or
altered in solid tumor cancers (FoundationOne). PDX
response did not correlate with the number of nongermline mutations (FC=-1.514, P=0.083; as determined
by SGZ algorithm) (Figure 1G) or overall mutation
burden (FC=-1.347, P=0.156; Supplementary Figure
2B). Furthermore, we found loss or mutation of TP53
and/or RB1 (hallmarks of SCLC) in the vast majority of
PDX tumors; however, the mutations observed in genes
previously associated with PARP inhibitor sensitivity were
not predicted to be functionally relevant, nor were they

significantly associated with talazoparib response in vivo
(Figure 1H). These findings suggest that the ability of HR
gene mutations and/or HRD scores to predict response
to PARP inhibitors is disease-specific and unlikely to
be a reliable method for selecting SCLC patients for
treatment. Overall, we identified a number of new markers
of sensitivity and resistance to PARP inhibitors in PDX
models of SCLC (Table 1).

SLFN11 and E-cadherin are the top biomarkers
of PARP inhibitor response in SCLC cell lines
Using an approach similar to the PDX analysis, we
then used a panel of 51 SCLC cell lines to validate markers
associated with drug sensitivity. Baseline expression of 170
proteins, including SLFN11 and ATM, were quantified by

RPPA in untreated cell lines and correlated with sensitivity
to PARP inhibitors (talazoparib, olaparib) and chemotherapy
(cisplatin) (Figure 2A). As with the PDXs, for all 3 drugs,
SLFN11 was the strongest marker of sensitivity by
Spearman correlation (cisplatin, P<0.0001; talazoparib,
P<0.0001; olaparib, P=0.02). In addition, E-cadherin was
again identified as a top marker of sensitivity to cisplatin
(P<0.007), talazoparib (P<0.002), and olaparib (P=0.021).
Statistical analysis of the association between ATM levels
and drug response was limited by the fact that only 4 cell
lines in the panel had low ATM levels.

cisplatin (FC=-3.889, P=0.04), talazoparib (FC=-4.664,
P=0.02), and olaparib (FC=-1.605, P=0.04).
Cell lines with high endogenous SLFN11 levels
(H209 and H526) were treated with cisplatin, olaparib,
or talazoparib to determine whether drug treatment
alters SLFN11 expression. Treatment with cisplatin and
both PARP inhibitors reduced SLFN11 (Figure 2C) and
E-cadherin (Supplementary Figure 7D) levels as measured
by relative density of western blots. Furthermore, cisplatin
treatment of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with high
endogenous levels of SLFN11 showed a subsequent
reduction in expression (A549, P=0.002; H1944,
P<0.0001; HCC827, P=0.001), but not those with low
levels (Calu6, P=0.785; Figure 2C). These data suggest
SLFN11 levels in patient tumors may be similarly dynamic
in response to treatment and, thus, biomarker analyses
of initial diagnostic biopsies may be poor predictors of
response to second or third line therapies.
Given the potential role of SLFN11 as a biomarker
for several drug classes, we expanded our drug analyses
of SCLC with high versus low SLFN11 expression levels
to a larger screen of 526 oncology drugs in 63 SCLC cell
lines [12]. We found that high SLFN11 protein levels, as
determined by bimodal distribution, are associated with
response to several drugs hitting the same targets or in
common drug classes (Figure 2D and 2E). For example,
high SLFN11 expression was correlated with sensitivity

classes and immune marker expression
SLFN11 protein and mRNA expression levels
were highly concordant across the 51 SCLC cell lines
(Rho=0.81, P<0.0001; Supplementary Figure 4A) and
bimodally distributed (based on bimodal index [BI]=2.76
and 3.01, respectively; Figure 2B and Supplementary
Figure 4A). Using the BI to define cell lines with high
versus low SLFN11 levels [20], we found that cell lines
with high SLFN11 protein expression were significantly
more sensitive to cisplatin (FC=-3.415, P=0.0002) and
talazoparib (FC=-4.367, P=0.004) but not olaparib (FC=1.273, P=0.185; Figure 2B). Similarly, the high SLFN11
mRNA expression group was also more sensitive to

to alkylating agents (n=14), TOP1 inhibitors (n=6),
TOP2A/B inhibitors (n=7), DNA synthesis inhibitors
(n=3), and PARP inhibitors (n=4). Interestingly, although
high SLFN11 expression was not correlated with olaparib
response in our analysis (P=0.185), it was correlated with
response to the drug in the analysis of the larger cell line
panel (P=0.002). Although SLFN11 has been associated
with sensitivity to drugs in these classes previously
[9, 12, 13], ours is the most comprehensive list to date
and includes additional drugs not previously reported.

In contrast to SLFN11, none of the other SLFN family
members (SLFN5, SLFN12, SLFN13, and SLFN14) were
associated with in vitro response to cisplatin or talazoparib
(Supplementary Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 3B).
As with the cell lines, we also observed a bimodal
distribution of SLFN11 in publically available mRNA
data from 70 early-stage, treatment-naïve SCLC patient
tumors (BI=1.46; Supplementary Figure 4A) [6], with
74% of tumors classified as SLFN11-high based on their
BI. To better understand the functional role of SLFN11

talazoparib, and olaparib sensitivity (IC50 values) and 171 proteins in 51 SCLC cell lines shows that SLFN11 is the strongest predictor of
sensitivity to both cisplatin and PARP inhibition. E-cadherin, but not ATM, is also correlated with drug sensitivity. B. SLFN11 expression

in tumors, we performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(www.ingenuity.com) comparing genes associated with
high vs. low SLFN11 levels. Interestingly, these analyses
revealed an enrichment of immune regulatory pathways,
primarily interferon (IFN) signaling (P=6.6*10-6), in
SLFN11-high tumors. Consistent with this, we found that
SLFN11 expression was positively correlated with Type I
IFN pathway genes [21] in treatment-naïve SCLC patient
tumors (Figure 2F). Furthermore, we screened a curated
gene list enriched for immune targets [17] and found
that high SLFN11 expression was positively correlated
with PDL1 (CD274; rho=0.248, P=0.025), CCL2
(rho=0.271, P=0.014), CTLA4 (rho=0.221, P=0.046), and
IL6 (rho=0.226, P=0.041) in these same patient tumors
(Figure 2F). This association was not observed in SCLC
cell lines and stimulation of SCLC cells with a Type I IFN
in vitro did not strongly modulate SLFN11 expression
(Supplementary Figure 6A), suggests that immune cell
expression of SLFN11 in patient tumors may be important.

either of the PARP inhibitors. Furthermore, as predicted,
the greatest sensitization was seen in cell lines with the
lowest SLFN11 levels (P<0.05 for both PARP inhibitors;
Figure 3E).

High SLFN11 enhances DNA damage response
We hypothesized that higher SLFN11 levels
sensitize cells to DNA-damaging agents because of
SLFN11’s roles in sequestering RPA and disrupting
checkpoint maintenance and HR repair [22]. To test this
hypothesis, we looked at markers of DDR after SLFN11
knockdown with and without low doses of PARP inhibitor
or cisplatin treatment. Low doses were used to minimize
cytotoxicity, so as to analyze DNA damage rather than
induction of apoptosis. We found that SLFN11 knockdown
alone did not increase expression of γH2AX or change
PARP1 levels (Figure 4A). However, the addition of
treatment with PARP inhibitors or cisplatin for 24h
prevented the induction of DNA damage (as indicated by
γH2AX expression) (Figure 4A), suggesting that SLFN11
plays a direct role in cellular accumulation of DNA
damage following stimulation.

Knockdown of SLFN11 and ATM directly alters
drug sensitivity
Because of their roles in DNA repair [22, 23], we
hypothesized that SLFN11 and ATM directly influence
drug response in SCLC. H209 and DMS79 cell lines
were selected for gene silencing based on their relatively
high SLFN11 and ATM levels, and absence of ATM
mutations. ATM mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary
Figure 4C) were reduced by knockdown (P<0.0008 and
<0.001, respectively; Figures 3C, 3D, and Supplementary
Figure 4C), as were SLFN11 mRNA and protein levels
(P<0.0001 and <0.0004, respectively; Figures 3A, 3B,
and Supplementary Figure 4C). Differences in expression
of ATM and SLFN11 were not present in control and
scrambled samples for DMS79 or H209 (P>0.2).
Silencing SLFN11 increased the resistance of the DMS79
(Figure 3A) and H209 (Figure 3B) cell lines to cisplatin
(P<0.0005, P=0.22), talazoparib (P<0.0001, P<0.005)
and olaparib (P<0.005, P=0.119; Supplementary Table 1).
Conversely, silencing of ATM increased the sensitivity of
DMS79 (Figure 3C) and H209 (Figure 3D) to cisplatin
(P=0.20, P<0.0001), talazoparib (P<0.009, P<0.0001) and
olaparib (P<0.006, P<0.0001; Supplementary Table 1).
These findings demonstrate that both SLFN11 and ATM
levels play a direct role in regulating cisplatin and PARP
inhibitor sensitivity/resistance in SCLC.
Based on our findings, we hypothesized that a
small molecule inhibitor of ATM may sensitize SLFN11low cell lines to PARP inhibition. Six SCLC cell lines
(H82, H69, H841, H865, H2198, and H446) were treated
with the ATM inhibitor KU55933 with or without the
PARP inhibitors olaparib or talazoparib. The cell lines
were not sensitive to treatment with the ATM inhibitor
alone. However, in 5 of the 6 cell lines, the addition of
the ATM inhibitor resulted in a modest sensitization to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Function and regulation of SLFN11 in SCLC
Silencing of SLFN11 or ATM did not alter PARP1
levels (Figure 4B), and PARP1 itself did not predict
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in our SCLC PDXs or
cell lines. One mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance
that has been described for other cancer types is
the downregulation of PARP1 itself [24], which we
hypothesized directly affects SLFN11 levels. Thus, we
generated cell lines with stable knockdown of PARP1 with
shRNA and assessed their SLFN11 levels. As shown by
densitometric analysis of western blots, the knockdown
cell lines had less SLFN11 (Figure 4B), regardless of the
degree of PARP1 reduction. This suggests that decreased
PARP1, as seen in some models of acquired resistance to
PARP inhibitors, may play a role in regulating SLFN11
although further investigation is needed.
In other cancers, including Ewing sarcoma,
SLFN11 has been described as an ETS transcription factor
response gene [25]. Thus, we tested whether similar
regulation of SLFN11 occurs in SCLC. Expression of 26
ETS transcription factors was correlated with SLFN11
and PARP1 mRNA levels and with drug sensitivity
(Supplementary Table 2). Of these, only EHF was
correlated with SLFN11 (P=0.048 in cell lines, p=0.004
in tumors; Supplementary Figure 6B) and with in vitro
drug sensitivity (P=0.045; Supplementary Figure 6C).
Like SLFN11, EHF was elevated in SCLC tumors
(versus normal adjacent tissues) (Supplementary Table 3)
and bimodally expressed (BI=2.66 in cell lines, 1.61 in
tumors) [26]. Suppression of EHF levels reduced SLFN11
expression (DMS79, P=0.003; Figure 4C). Overall, this

suggests that the ETS transcription factors regulating
SLFN11 may be cancer-specific.
SLFN11 levels are sensitive to hypermethylation
of the SLFN11 promoter [27]. To determine whether
epigenetic methylation also plays a role in SLFN11 levels
in SCLC, we analyzed 35 SCLC cell lines by Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina).
Levels of methylation in 19 CpG regions were linked to
SLFN11. We identified 3 regions within the TSS that were
negatively correlated with SLFN11 mRNA expression and
2 of these were also correlated with resistance to cisplatin,
talazoparib, and olaparib (Supplementary Figure 8A-8D).
The cg18608369 region, which has been reported to be
correlated with cisplatin and carboplatin resistance in
the NCI60 cell line panel [27], was not correlated with
cisplatin resistance in SCLC (P=0.45). Treatment with
a demethylase and/or HDAC inhibitor did not increase
SLFN11 expression, and demethylation with decitabine
did not improve SCLC cell lines’ sensitivity to cisplatin
or PARP inhibitors (data not shown). Although SLFN11
promoter methylation is associated with cisplatin and
PARP inhibitor resistance, demethylation and/or HDAC

inhibition were not sufficient to upregulate SLFN11 levels
(Supplementary Figure 8E). MGMT methylation was not
strongly correlated with SLFN11 expression or sensitivity
to talazoparib or olaparib (data not shown).

E-cadherin expression predicts drug sensitivity
in SCLC
E-cadherin was a top marker of drug sensitivity
in PDX models and cell lines (Figures 1B, 1C, and 2A).
Therefore, to further establish whether the differences
in E-cadherin reflected a broader EMT program, we
investigated miRNAs and genes with established roles in
EMT (e.g., miR200 family members, ZEB1, EMT gene
signatures). Specimens were defined as mesenchymal if
they had low E-cadherin protein (cell lines, as defined
by their bi-modal index of 1.72) or a positive EMT gene
signature score (patient tumors) (Figure 5A–5B) [6].
As expected, we observed a strong correlation between
high E-cadherin levels and the miR-200 family members
(r=0.29-0.83, corresponding to P<0.05-P<0.001), which
are established repressors of EMT (Figure 5A) [28]. We

Silencing of SLFN11 with siRNA in DMS79 and H209 SCLC cell lines (which have high SLFN11 expression levels, are sensitive to PARP
inhibition, and have no ATM mutations), increases the cells’ resistance to cisplatin, talazoparib and olaparib. C, and D. ATM knockdown
increases sensitivity to cisplatin, talazoparib, and olaparib. siRNA effectively reduced SLFN11 and ATM. E. ATM inhibition sensitizes cell
lines with low SLFN11 expression to PARP inhibition. The ATM inhibitor KU55933 plus talazoparib or olaparib was more effective in
SCLC cell lines with lower SLFN11 levels.

then evaluated cell lines and SCLC patient tumors for
association between high E-cadherin levels or low EMT
scores, respectively and a curated list of genes known to
be markers of cancer stem cells [29, 30], involved in EMT
[31], and associated with tumor progression in SCLC
[32]. In both cell lines and tumors, we found that high
E-cadherin is inversely correlated with the EMT gene
signature score (rho=-0.705, P<0.001 in cell lines, rho=0.463, P<0.001 in tumors) (Figure 5A–5B). In general,
epithelial cell lines and tumors were associated with
cancer stem cell markers (CD24, ALDH1A1, and PROM1),
markers of tumor aggressiveness (MYCL1 and ASCL1),
and markers of apoptosis (BCL2 and BCL2L11). However,
mesenchymal cell lines and tumors were primarily
associated with EMT markers (ZEB1 and ZEB2). As
SCLC is an extremely aggressive disease and CDH1 levels
are significantly higher in tumors than in normal adjacent
tissues (FC=3.722; P<0.0001), the correlation between
CDH1 and these markers is not surprising (Supplementary
Figure 7C).
Using an approach similar to that applied to
SLFN11, we then investigated other drug classes for

which E-cadherin might be a predictive marker of
response in SCLC. Based on the bimodal index, we
found that high E-cadherin level was associated with
sensitivity to several drug types, including PARP
inhibitors (n=5), alkylating agents (n=8), TOP2A/B
inhibitors (n=4), HDAC1 inhibitors (n=3), BCL2
inhibitors (n=3), and IGF1R inhibitors (n=4) (Figure 5A–
5D). Many of these drug classes overlap with those to
which SLFN11-expressing SCLC cell lines are sensitive,
although E-cadherin and SLFN11 levels were not
strongly correlated (R=0.233, P=0.058; Supplementary
Figure 7B), suggesting that EMT and SLFN11 contribute
independently to drug response.

DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that high SLFN11 and low
ATM expression levels predict PARP inhibitor response
in PDX models and/or cell lines, whereas standard
biomarkers of PARP inhibition defined in other cancer
types (mutational burden, Myriad HRD score, and
mutations in DDR genes) do not [33]. We also report for

Figure 4: SLFN11 is Regulated by PARP1 and EHF. A. Silencing of SLFN11 in H209 and DMS79 is insufficient to induce the

expression of H2AX, a marker of DNA damage. Stimulation with olaparib, talazoparib, and cisplatin induced γH2AX in scrambled (SCR)
but not SLFN11-knockdown cells. B. Silencing of SLFN11 or ATM does not affect PARP1 levels. Silencing of PARP1 in H209 and H526
cells reduces SLFN11 levels. C. EHF expression is elevated in SCLC tumors compared to normal adjacent tissues and is correlated with
SLFN11 expression in tumors from treatment-naïve patients with early-stage SCLC. Silencing of EHF reduces SLFN11 mRNA and protein
expression levels.

the first time that EMT score and E-cadherin levels predict
response to PARP inhibition, chemotherapy, and other
targeted drugs in development for SCLC. Thus, multiple
biomarkers, including SLFN11, ATM, and E-cadherin,
may be important in predicting PARP inhibition or
chemotherapy response in SCLC.
Although low ATM levels were associated
with talazoparib response in PDX models, we had an
insufficient number of ATM-low cell lines to test its
predictive value across our cell line panel. However, we
found that ATM knockdown increased PARP inhibitor
and cisplatin sensitivity, suggesting that loss of ATM
expression has a direct impact on drug sensitivity. Further
supporting this, we found that the combination of ATM
and PARP inhibitors overcame resistance to singleagent PARP inhibition in lines with low SLFN11. These
findings—together with recent clinical data showing
that ATM mutations are associated with response to the

PARP inhibitor olaparib in prostate cancer patients [34]—
support the further investigation of ATM protein level as
a candidate predictive biomarker. Moreover, inhibiting
both ATM and PARP could help overcome drug resistance
in patients whose tumors have low SLFN11 expression
levels.
Based on levels of SLFN11 and ATM observed in
treatment-naïve SCLC tumors, we expect that up to half
of SCLC patients could respond to PARP inhibitors in
the front-line setting. However, given that these cancers
develop chemotherapy resistance within a few months
after initial treatment, we predicted that SLFN11—a
biomarker of cisplatin and PARP inhibitor response—
may be downregulated following platinum-based
chemotherapy. Indeed, cell lines treated with cisplatin or
PARP inhibitors had reduced SLFN11 levels. This implies
that archival (diagnostic) tumor tissue may not accurately
predict response to PARP inhibitors in patients who have

developed cisplatin resistance and, therefore, re-biopsy
may be necessary to accurately assess biomarker status.
We found that SLFN11 directly regulated sensitivity
to PARP inhibitors and cisplatin. Furthermore, loss of
SLFN11 resulted in reduced DNA damage in response to
cisplatin and PARP inhibitors, suggesting that its action is
likely through regulation of DDR. Previous studies have
shown that SLFN11 is recruited to sites of DNA damage,
where it disrupts checkpoint maintenance and reduces
HR repair [22]. We propose that high levels of SLFN11
may induce a type of synthetic lethality following PARP
inhibitor or cisplatin treatment by negatively regulating
DNA repair. Furthermore, based on our observation that
silencing PARP1 reduced SLFN11 levels, loss of PARP1
expression (as described in some models of acquired
PARP inhibitor resistance [24]), may mediate the loss of
drug sensitivity directly through SLFN11 downregulation.
SLFN11 levels directly confer chemotherapy and/
or PARP inhibitor sensitivity in a number of cancer
types, but it is unclear how this is controlled. Proposed
mechanisms of SLFN11 regulation include IFN signaling
[35], ETS transcription factor binding [25], and promoter
methylation [27]. Several immune-related targets were
found to be correlated with SLFN11 in early-stage SCLC,
including 16 Type I IFN signaling pathway genes and
targetable immune markers PDL1 and CTLA4. SLFN11
is expressed by T-cells and monocytes and is an IFNstimulated gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
[36]. However, SLFN11 is not IFN-stimulated in SCLC
cell lines suggesting that expression and regulation of
SLFN11 by tumor and immune cells may be different.
SLFN11 is also a potential surrogate marker of T-cell or
macrophage infiltration and a biomarker for response to
immunotherapy drugs targeting PDL1 and CTLA4, but
this requires further testing in a clinical setting. Given the
recent addition of immunotherapy to treatment options
for relapsed SCLC (www.NCCN.org), these findings
merit further investigation given their potential clinical
impact [37]. The SLFN11 promoter contains several ETS
binding sites and functions as an ETS factor response
gene, with ETS transcription factors FLI1 and ETS1
having proposed roles in regulating SLFN11 expression
in colon, breast, and prostate cancers [25]. In our analysis
of ETS family members, only EHF is elevated in SCLC
tumors, positively correlated with SLFN11 response (cell
line and tumors) and predicts drug response. In contrast,
EHF is negatively correlated with SLFN11 expression
in other cancers from NCI60 and CCLE data sets [25].
These findings imply that although SLFN11 functions as
an ETS response gene, the particular ETS transcription
factor that regulates SLFN11 expression is cancer type–
specific. In agreement with previous studies showing that
hypermethylation regulates SLFN11 and is correlated with
cisplatin sensitivity in NCI60 cell lines [27], we found
two CpG regions near the SLFN11 TSS to be inversely
correlated with SLFN11 mRNA levels and with in vitro
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sensitivity to both cisplatin and PARP inhibitors. However,
treatment with decitabine and/or an HDAC inhibitor
was insufficient to raise SLFN11 levels in SCLC cell
lines. This suggests that methylation or other epigenetic
modifications may not be dominant regulators of SLFN11
levels in SCLC, but may be useful as a biomarker of
response to both cisplatin and PARP inhibitors.
We and others have previously shown an
important role for EMT in modulating drug resistance
in NSCLC. However, this is the first report linking
EMT with resistance to multiple drug classes in
SCLC. We found a significant association between
EMT and resistance to PARP inhibitors, cisplatin, and
other novel drug classes such as Bcl-2 inhibitors. In
SCLC lines and patient tumors, loss of E-cadherin
and high EMT gene signature score were associated
with changes at the protein, miRNA, and mRNA level
in genes and miRNA well known to regulate EMT,
further supporting the presence of a mesenchymal
subset of SCLC. This included downregulation of miR200 family members (important regulators of EMT,
metastasis, and disease recurrence in NSCLC) [28, 38];
higher ZEB1/2, FOXO1, and NEUROD1; and decreased
levels of stem cell markers (e.g., ALDH1A1) and other
SCLC drivers (e.g., MYCL1, ASCL1) [32, 39]. ASCL1
and NEUROD1 are both necessary for SCLC tumor
survival and disease progression, but regulate different
downstream pathways, and whether they are involved in
EMT is unknown [32].
To further explore the association between EMT and
drug resistance, we expanded our analysis to a large screen
of oncology drugs [12]. In addition to PARP inhibitors,
this analysis revealed greater resistance of mesenchymal
SCLC to alkylating agents, TOP2A/B inhibitors, BCL2
inhibitors, IGF1R inhibitors, and HDAC1 inhibitors.
The higher response rate of E-cadherin high SCLC to
BCL2 inhibitors (e.g., ABT-737, ABT-263, venetoclax)
corresponded with higher BCL2 mRNA expression in
the E-cadherin high cell lines and tumors, suggesting that
BCL2 levels or EMT status could be used to help select
patients for treatment with BCL-2 inhibitors and that
pharmacologic strategies to reverse EMT may enhance
BCL-2 inhibitor activity.
In conclusion, our findings support the notion that
more than one biomarker is needed to predict SCLC
response to PARP inhibition and/or chemotherapy and that
expression of these biomarkers is dynamically regulated
by drugs used in frontline therapy. In addition, our results
show that SLFN11 and ATM directly regulate drug
sensitivity, which suggests that therapeutically targeting
these proteins may reduce or delay drug resistance
in SCLC. Our results also show that the dependence
of SLFN11 levels on PARP1 may represent a novel
mechanism of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors.
Finally, E-cadherin levels and EMT score are linked with
SCLC response to PARP inhibitors, chemotherapy, and
28584

other targeted therapies. Future studies should investigate
methods to restore SLFN11 levels in resistant models and
mechanisms regulating EMT, in order to develop means to
therapeutically alter EMT while inhibiting PARP in SCLC.

(V3LHS_391011, V3LHS_391013). Knock
efficiencies were assessed with western blotting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To determine effect of drug treatment on protein
expression, H209 and H526 cells were plated for 24
h and then treated with 1 µM cisplatin, 1 µM olaparib,
100 nM talazoparib. Cells were collected 72 h later, and
protein lysates were isolated. SLFN11, E-cadherin, and
ATM expression were assessed by western blotting. For
the demethylation/HDAC inhibition experiments, H69,
H526, H841, and H209 cells were plated for 24 h and
then treated for 72 h with dimethyl sulfoxide or 5 µM
decitabine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or with 100
ng/ml trichostatin A (Sigma Aldrich) added in the last 16h.
All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Drug treatments

Histology and IHC of PDX models
A pathologist specializing in lung cancer (J.F.)
reviewed each PDX model for hematoxylin and eosin and
standard SCLC IHC markers (CD56, chromogranin A,
and synaptophysin) to confirm that tumor pathology was
consistent with SCLC.
IHC markers assessed in this study included those
used routinely in the clinical diagnosis and characterization
of lung cancers (synaptophysin, CD56, chromogranin A,
Ki-67, and TTF1) and candidate biomarkers (SLFN11,
ATM, and PARP).

DNA from PDX tumors was profiled using the
clinical comprehensive genomic profiling FoundationOne
hybrid-capture based NGS test (Foundation Medicine,
Inc., Cambridge, MA) [40]. Mutation load was
extrapolated to the exome or genome and estimated. The
mutation load per megabase was calculated by dividing the
total number of counted mutations by the coding region of
the test (1.110 megabases). Foundation Medicine’s SGZ
algorithm was used to predict germline mutations [41].
Genomic instability was predicted for the PDX tumors and
for 12 SCLC cell lines using the myChoice HRD assay
(Myriad Genetics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT).

Cell lines
Cells were grown in suggested media supplemented
with fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells
were passaged less than 6 months from the time they were
received, and cell lines were routinely subjected to DNA
fingerprinting as described previously [2].

Gene knockdown
For gene silencing, pooled small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) targeting SLFN11 (L-016764–01-0005) or ATM
(L-003201-00-0005) and their corresponding scramble
control (D-001810–10-05; GE Dharmacon) or EHF
(S25399) and the Silencer Select Negative Control No. 2
(4390846, ThermoFisher Scientific) were transfected into
H209 and DMS79 cells for 72 hours. The cells were then
plated for 7-day proliferation assays or 24-h single-agent
drug treatment. Knock down efficiency was validated
by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction and western blot analyses. PARP1 was stably
knocked down in H209 and H526 cell lines using plasmid
vectors. The PARP1 shRNAs were from GE Dharmacon
