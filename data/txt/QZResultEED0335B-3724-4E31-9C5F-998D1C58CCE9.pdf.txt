The oncogene Lysosome-associated protein transmembrane-4β (LAPTM4B) gene was identiﬁed, and the polymorphism region in
the 5ʹ-UTR of this gene was certiﬁed to be associated with tumor susceptibility. LAPTM4B-35 protein was found to be highly
expressed in various solid tumors and could be a poor prognosis marker. The functions of LAPTM4B in solid tumors were also
explored. It is suggested that LAPTM4B could promote the proliferation of tumor cells, boost invasion and metastasis, resist
apoptosis, initiate autophagy and assist drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Carcinogenesis is a complicated process that involves multiple
stages with gene mutations accumulated, which results in
deregulation of proliferation, invasion and metastasis, recurrence
and drug resistance, leading to a poor prognosis. Despite the fact
that more and more oncogenes have been found and various
therapies targeting these oncogenes also have been developed in
recent years, the cure rate of cancers is not satisfactory. Therefore,
a lot of work about oncogenes and their relationship with
carcinogenesis still needs to be done and is challenging.
In this review, we introduced the oncogene Lysosome-associated
protein transmembrane-4β (LAPTM4B) gene, which was ﬁrst cloned
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. A series of research ﬁndings,
such as structures of LAPTM4B gene and protein, transcription
regulations of LAPTM4B gene, relationships between polymorphisms
of LAPTM4B and tumor susceptibility and the functions of LAPTM4B
in solid tumors, were summarized, and they are shown in this article.
CLONING AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE LAPTM4B GENE
A gene involved in the proliferation and/or differentiation of
hepatocytes was originally cloned using rapid ampliﬁcation of
complementary DNA ends and reverse transcription–PCR in HCC
tissues by Zhou Rouli in 2000.1 It was highly expressed in HCC, as
well as in paired noncancerous liver and fetal liver cells, but
showed very low expression in normal adult liver cells.1 The gene
was designed by HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, and it
was named as LAPTM4B (GenBank ACCESSION NM: AY057051,
NM_018407, Gene ID 55353).
BLAST program analysis shows that the LAPTM4B gene is
mapped to chromosome 8q22.1, spanning at least 50 kb. It is
composed of seven extrons separated by six introns and contains
an open reading frame including 951 nucleotides. Extron 1
contains the 5ʹ untranslated sequence (5ʹ-UTR) and the initiating
methionine (Met). The mRNA of LAPTM4B is ~ 2.2 kb in length and

is in agreement with the size of the mRNA observed in Northern
blots. There are two polyadenylation signal sites in the 3ʹ-UTR,
AATAAA and AATTAAA. The alternative polyadenylation (AATAAA)
may result in another 1.42 -kb mRNA variant.2
STRUCTURE OF THE LAPTM4B PROTEIN
The full-length complementary DNA of LAPTM4B contains two
translational initiation codons (ATG) with an interval of 273 bp,
and encode two protein isoforms, LAPTM4B-35 and LAPTM4B-24,
with molecular weights of 35 kDa and 24 kDa, respectively.
LAPTM4B-35 contains 317 amino acid residues and has a pI at
9.07 because of its high content of arginine residues. LAPTM4B-24
comprised 226 amino acid residues and has a pI at 4.65 because of
its high content of acidic amino acid residues.
Computer analysis shows that LAPTM4B is an integral membrane
protein, with four transmembrane regions at 117–133, 163–179,
200–216 and 243–259 amino acids, respectively (Figure 1). It also has
two extracelluar domains (EC1 and EC2): one N-terminal and one
C-terminal tail in the cytoplasm. The full amino acid sequence
contains one N-glycosylation site, eight phosphorylation sites, six
putative sites in the cytoplasm and four N-myristoylation sites.
Structurally, LAPTM4B-35 differs from LAPTM4B-24 in that it contains
extra 91 amino acid residues at the N terminus that harbors a
proline-rich domain, PPRP. It serves as the binding site of the SH3
domain of some signaling molecules and has critical roles in the
proliferation and metastatic potentials of tumor cells.3 Moreover,
LAPTM4B contains several putative lysosomal targeting motifs in the
C termini, including tyrosine-based (YXXф), PY (L/PPXY) and
dileucine ([DE]XXXL[LI]) motifs. Except for PY motifs, these motifs
are recognized by major adapter proteins, which are involved in
transporting from the Golgi to lysosome.4 Its C-terminal PY motifs
can interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase neuronal precursor-cell
expressed developmentally down-regulated 4(Nedd4), participating in the lysosomal and plasma membrane sorting.5

EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF LAPTM4B
Expression of LAPTM4B mRNA has been evaluated via Northern
blotting, reverse transcription–PCR and hybridization in situ.
LAPTM4B mRNA is expressed in a variety of human normal
tissues: its expression is high in the testis, heart, skeletal muscle
and uterus; moderate in ovary, kidney and pancreas; low in liver,
spleen and thymus; and lowest in lung and peripheral leukocytes.6
It is also expressed highly in fetal kidney, heart and spleen
(Figure 2).
Immunohistochemistry with an antibody speciﬁcally proved
that LAPTM4B-35, but not LAPTM4B-24, is upregulated in a wide
range of cancers including hepatocellular cancer, breast cancer,
gastric cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, gallbladder cancer,
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and ovarian carcinoma. In
addition, the ratio of LAPTM4B-35 to LAPTM4B-24 may be related
to the development of various cancers.3 Note that there was a
signiﬁcantly positive correlation between LAPTM4B-35 expression
levels and the probability of metastasis to lymph nodes or distant
organs, whereas LAPTM4B-35 expression levels were inversely
associated with the differentiation status of cancer tissues and the
overall and disease-free postresectional survival of patients with
gallbladder cancer,7 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,8 ovarian
cancer,9 HCC,10 gastric cancer11 and cervical cancer.12
TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF LAPTM4B
Moreover, overexpression of LAPTM4B in solid cancers may result
from transcriptional regulation by transcription factors or microRNAs. In recent years, an increasing number of researches have
focused on the upstream regulation of LAPTM4B. SP1 binds 558bp
upstream of LAPTM4B transcription initiation site, and it is
correlated with high expression of LAPTM4B in hepatocelluar
carcinoma.13 In addition, cyclic AMP responsive element-binding
protein-1 (CREB1) is a transcription factor that has a vital role in
cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. It was also regarded
as an oncogene that promotes tumor cell growth and proliferation. A previous study showed that CREB1 binds to the +157–+165
fragment of LAPTM4B promoter region and then upregulates the
transcription of LAPTM4B in breast cancer.14 MiR-188-5p also
suppresses the expression of LAPTM4B through binding to its
3ʹ-UTR area, which results in the inhibition of cell proliferation,
invasion and migration in prostate cancer.15 Moreover, a study
revealed that enforced expression of the homeobox transcription
factor, which has an important role in hematopoietic stem cell

self-renewal and expansion, could upregulate LAPTM4B expression in hematopoietic stem cells rather than in mature hematopoietic cells.16
LAPTM4B POLYMORPHISM AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CARCINOMAS
There are two alleles of LAPTM4B named LAPTM4B*1 and
LAPTM4B*2 (GenBank numbers AY219176 and AY219177, respectively), encoding 35- and 40- kDa proteins, respectively. Allele *1
contains only one copy of a 19-bp sequence at the 5ʹ-UTR of the
ﬁrst exon, whereas this segment of allele *2 is duplicated and
tandemly repeated17 (Figure 3). Compared with allele*1, the extra
19 -bp sequence changes the open reading frame of LAPTM4B
gene and makes allele *2 encode one more protein isoform,
a 40-kD protein. The mRNA of allele *1 starts translation only at
nucleotide 157, because there are in-frame termination codons at
nucleotides 40 and 103. However, the mRNA of allele *2 starts
translation at nucleotide 17, which produces a protein with an
extra 53 amino acids at its N terminus than allele *1 (Figure 4). The
function of the 40 -kDa protein encoded by allele *2 and its
correlation with disease has not been elaborated so far. A more
in-depth research will be required to clarify these points.
Previous studies have shown that LAPTM4B polymorphisms
were related to susceptibility to HCC,18,19 breast cancer,20–22 nonsmall lung cancer,23 gastric cancer,24 cervical cancer,25 endometrial carcinoma,26 colorectal cancer,27 lymphoma,28 gallbladder
carcinoma,29 ovarian carcinoma30 and malignant melanoma,31 but
not to squamous cell carcinomas such as esophageal carcinoma,
rectum carcinoma27 and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.32 Lately, a
meta-analysis in Chinese Han population revealed that LAPTM4B
allele *2 carriers exhibited a higher cancer risk compared with
allele *1 homozygotes (for *1/2, odds ratio = 1.55, 95% conﬁdence
interval 1.367–1.758; for *2/2, odds ratio = 2.093, 95% conﬁdence
interval 1.666–2.629; for *1/2 + *2/2, odds ratio = 1.806, 95%
conﬁdence interval 1.527–2.137). Moreover, LAPTM4B allele *2 has
been proven to be a risk factor for cancer (odds ratio = 1.487, 95%
conﬁdence interval 1.339–1.651).33
FUNCTIONS OF LAPTM4B AND THE MECHANISMS THEREOF
LAPTM4B gene promotes the growth and proliferation of cells in
various kinds of tumors
Uncontrolled cell growth is the main biological property of
tumors. The proteins of LAPTM4B gene, LAPTM4B-35 and
LAPTM4B-24, have an important role in promoting growth and
proliferation of cells in many kinds of tumors. In HCC, the effect of
LAPTM4B-35 on xenograft tumor growth of HepG2 cells was
examined in BALB/c nude mice. The tumor growth of mice with
stable overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 HepG2 cells was signiﬁcantly more rapid than that in the Mock group, whereas the tumor

sequence. ATG loci are shown, respectively. The nucleotide sequence is numbered with transcriptional start site as +1. Allele *1 contains only
one copy of the 19-bp sequence; meanwhile, allele *2 contains two copies of the 19- bp sequence in a tandem array.

AKT, glycogen synthase kinase 3β can be phosphorylated, and it
results in the attenuation of phosphorylation and degradation
of c-Myc. Besides, another downstream target of activated AKT,
forkhead box O4, the transcription factor of p27, can also be
phosphorylated, and it results in the inactivation of forkhead box
O4.34 Recently, researchers found that LAPTM4B-24 may also have
a relationship with tumor growth. In Hela cells, LAPTM4B-24
knockdown attenuated cell proliferation and reduced the cell size,
which were restored by re-expression of LAPTM4B-24.37

the alleles are represented in italics. The mRNA of allele *1 can start

acids, which are boxed at the N terminus of LAPTM4B.

growth of mice with stable knockdown of LAPTM4B-35 HepG2
cells was slower than that in the Mock group. In addition, the
3-(4,5-dimethylthylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay also showed that the growth rate of stable
knockdown LAPTM4B-35 HepG2 cells was reversed after transfecting the LAPTM4B-35 protein expression plasmid.34 In gallbladder
carcinoma, MTT assay and ﬂow cytometry experiment also
demonstrated that overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 can boost the
proliferation of gallbladder carcinoma cells.7 Some other researchers used RNA interference to knock down LAPTM4B-35 protein in
Hela cells and showed that Hela cells with depletion of
LAPTM4B-35 had a low growth rate in the CCK8 assay.35
The function of LAPTM4B-35 was also certiﬁed in non-small cell
lung cancer, where stable knockdown of LAPTM4B in Calu-6
lung cancer cells statistically reduced anchorage-dependent
and anchorage-independent colonies.36 The mechanisms of
LAPTM4B-35 involved in promoting the growth and proliferation
of carcinoma cells may attribute to affect proliferation-regulating
proteins and activate the AKT signaling pathway. By activating

LAPTM4B gene promotes metastasis and invasion of tumor cells
LAPTM4B gene can promote metastasis and invasion of tumor
cells, which is line with a series of results. In HepG2 cells that
overexpress LAPTM4B-35, the Boyden chamber assay demonstrated that cell migration and invasion were promoted compared
with mock cells.34 In addition, LAPTM4B knockdown may also
suppress HeLa cell migration in vitro. The ability to invade Matrigel
was assessed using a Transwell assay. In parallel, knockdown of
LAPTM4B decreased invasion and migration of related proteins,
such as matrix metalloprotein 2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloprotein 9
(MMP-9), CDK12 and HIF-1α.35 The promotion of metastasis and
invasion by LAPTM4B-35 may be contributed by the PPRP motif of
LAPTM4B-35, which can interact with SH3 domain-containing
proteins that are involved in many signaling pathways.3 Besides, a
series of clinical experiments showed that carcinomas derived
from stomach, breast, colon, ovary, liver, pancreas, cervix, prostate,
lung, endomentrium and gallbladder with LAPTM4B-35 overexpression may present more invasive characteristics.10,36,38–49
LAPTM4B gene inhibits apoptosis
Resistance to apoptosis is one of the classical characteristics of
cancer cells. As it is an oncogene, overexpression of the LAPTM4B
gene has been shown to inhibit apoptosis function. After treating
HCC cells with Adriamycin to induce apoptosis, the apoptosis rate
was reduced in stable LAPTM4B-overexpressing HepG2 cells but it
was increased in stable LAPTM4B knockdown HepG2 cells as
compared with the mock group. In addition, restoration of
LAPTM4B-35 by transfection of LAPTM4B-35 expression plasmid
into stable LAPTM4B knockdown HepG2 cells reversed the
apoptosis rate. Besides, a series of apoptosis-related proteins such
as cleaved caspase-3 and PARP were decreased in stable LAPTM4B
overexpression HepG2 cells but increased in stable LAPTM4B
knockdown HepG2 cells.34 In gallbladder carcinoma cells, overexpression of LAPTM4B can also attenuate epirubicin-induced
apoptosis, which was certiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry experiment and
apoptosis-related protein analysis.50 In breast cancer, the
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis rate of MDA-MB-231 and BT549
breast tumor cells increased after small interfering RNA targeting
LAPTM4B was transfected into them.51 On the other hand, some
researchers thought that low LAPTM4B expression could also
inhibit the classical apoptosis pathway. A431 cells stably

overexpressing LAPTM4B were sensitized to caspase-3 activation
after treatment with anthracyclines or paclitaxel. Conversely,
A431 cells depleted of LAPTM4B were protected from anthracycline- and paclitaxel-induced PARP cleavage. The same phenomenon was also seen in KPL-4 breast cancer cells. In this
regard, researchers thought that LAPTM4B might affect sensitivity to chemotherapeutic compounds and cell death mechanisms differently depending on its expression level and ceramide
compartmentalization. Cells with high levels of LAPTM4B
expression displayed increased clearance of ceramide from late
endosome, sensitizing cells to ceramide-induced apoptosis. In
parallel, late endosome membranes were stabilized and cells
were not sensitized to lysosome-mediated death. On the other
hand, cells with low LAPTM4B expression made ceramide
sequestered in late endosome, protecting cells from ceramide
toxicity in the late endosome but sensitizing cells to lysosomemediated death.52
LAPTM4B gene and autophagy initiation
Autophagy is a salvage pathway that damages organelles to
lysosomes for recycling energy and nutrients. A series of studies
have demonstrated that autophagy has a dual function in
tumorigenesis.53 On one hand, increased autophagy can make
cancer cells tolerant to metabolic stress to promote
tumorigenesis,54 and on the other hand defective autophagy
can also drive tumorigenesis by the accumulation of genotoxic
cellular waste, which boosts the acquisition of gene mutations
resulting in the transformation of precancerous cells.55 Owing to
the functions of lysosomes in the completion of autophagy, the
effect of LAPTM4B was also examined on the process of
autophagy. Under the condition of starvation stress, breast cancer
cells with LAPTM4B knockdown fail to undergo autophagosome–
lysosome fusion and autolysosome formation. In addition,
depletion of LAPTM4B in breast cancer cells leads to increased
autophagosome but decreased autophagy ﬂux, which suggests
that LAPTM4B has a key role in later stages of autophagy
maturation.56 For a further step, these ﬁndings were also explored
in multiple kinds of cancer patients. A survey including 211 human
autophagy-associated genes was conducted for tumor-related
alterations to DNA sequence and RNA expression levels and their
association with patient survival outcomes in multiple cancer
types. In the survey, researchers found that the LAPTM4B gene was
a positive modulator in autophagy progress but was differentially
expressed in various kinds of cancer. Compared with normal
tissue, LAPTM4B was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma
and lung squamous cell carcinoma, but the expression was low in
kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. Besides, mRNA of LAPTM4B was
found to be increased or decreased in patients with diseasespeciﬁc molecular alterations or clinical phenotypes, compared
with patients not harboring those alteration or phenotypes in
three cancers (Table 1).57 Recently, researchers found that
LAPTM4B had functions in autophagy progress related with
inactive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or active EGFR.
The inactive EGFR was shown to initiate autophagy independent
of its kinase activity, and serum starvation led to the accumulation
of unphosphorylated EGFR at LAPTM4B-positive endosomes.
Further, a series of assays showed that inactive EGFR that localized
at endosomes interacted with LAPTM4B and stabilized each other.
Regardless of whether EGFR or LAPTM4B was knocked down, the
other one would be decreased accordingly, which ﬁnally led to the
inhibition of autophagy. Investigating the mechanism of this,
researchers suggested that inactive EGFR and LAPTM4B recruited
exocyst subcomplex containing Sec5 to promote EGFR association
with autophagy inhibitor Rubicon, which in turn dissociated
Beclin1 to start autophagy.58 On the other side, LAPTM4B could
promote active EGFR signaling by blocking EGF-stimulated EGFR
intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation to inhibit

autophagy. By enhancing the ubiquitination of Hrs by the E3
ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, LAPTM4B could inhibit the function of Hrs
so that EGF-stimulated EGFR signaling could be prolonged.59
Although LAPTM4B may have different roles in the EGFR-related
autophagy progression, LAPTM4B facilitates the prosurvival
functions of EGFR in cancer cells in both conditions.
LAPTM4B motivates multidrug resistance
Chemotherapy resistance is always a main obstacle in the
progression of treatment. Some genes located at the 8q22
chromosome have been shown to be associated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer cells.60
The chemotherapyresistant function of LAPTM4B has attracted the attention of
researchers, as this gene is located in the same region. By using
small interfering RNAs against LAPTM4B in BT549 cells, researchers
found that cell lines without LAPTM4B increased the sensitivity to
anthracyclines, doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Following the
autoﬂuorescence of doxorubicin, researchers showed that breast
cancer cell lines with LAPTM4B gene knockdown resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase in nuclear localization of doxorubicin.56
Besides, LAPTM4B overexpression can also increase the efﬂux of
chemodrugs such as paclitaxel and cisplatin, and LAPTM4B
knockdown increases the intention of these drugs in HeLa cells.
However, the LAPTM4B protein does not contain ATP-binding
cassette, which means that the LAPTM4B protein cannot function
as an efﬂux pump itself to be responsible for multidrug resistance.
The other ATP-dependent membrane efﬂux transporter, P-glycoprotein, was demonstrated to be the assistant of LAPTM4B-35
protein in the progression of chemotherapy resistance. Besides
drug efﬂux, other molecular mechanisms of LAPTM4B for multidrug resistance were explored. It is suggested that overexpression
of LATP4M4B-35 also motivates chemotherapy resistance by the
activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through interaction
of PPRP motif contained in the N terminus of LAPTM4B-35 with
the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K.61 Recently, a study showed
that LAPTM4B can promote AKT signaling by blocking EGFR
degradation speciﬁcally, and this would be one mechanism for the
role of LAPTM4B in chemotherapy resistance. LAPTM4B interacts
with E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 to promote ubiquitination of Hrs
(an ESCRT-0 subunit), which inhibits the Hrs association with
ubiquitinated EGFR and therefore inhibits EGFR intraluminal
sorting and lysosomal degradation. At the same time, a PIP
kinase, PIPKIγi5, directly binds to LAPTM4B and antagonizes the
function of LAPTM4B in EGFR sorting by generating PtdIns(4,5)P2
signals and recruiting SNX5 (Figure 5).59

Figure 5. Summary of the mechanisms for LAPTM4B promoting cancer development. (a) LAPTM4B inhibits the function of Hrs so that EGFstimulated EGFR signaling can be prolonged and ﬁnally promotes cell proliferation and chemotherapy resistance, by enhancing the
ubiquitination of Hrs by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. (b) Inactive EGFR and LAPTM4B recruited exocyst subcomplex containing Sec5 to
promote the association of EGFR with autophagy inhibitor Rubicon, which in turn dissociated Beclin1 to start autophagy. (c) Cells with high
levels of LAPTM4B expression displayed increased clearance of ceramide from late endosome, which makes late endosome membranes stable
and cells insensitive to lysosome-mediated death. (d) LAPTM4B activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by its PPRP motif. The active AKT
makes the glycogen synthase kinase -3β phosphorylated, which attenuates the phosphorylation of c-Myc and results in the accumulation of
c-Myc. The active AKT also phosphorylates FOXO4, resulting in transcription failure of p27 gene. (e) LAPTM4B motivates multidrug resistance
through efﬂux by interaction with P-glycoprotein and activating PI3K/AKT signaling. However, LAPTM4B-overexpressing cells do not have a
high expression of P-glycoprotein, and hence further research is needed regarding this mechanism. (f) Overexpression of LAPTM4B leads to
overexpression of MMP-2 or MMP-9, and the PPRP motif of LAPTM4B can interact with SH3 domain-containing signaling proteins related with
invasion and metastasis; however, the speciﬁc mechanism should be explored in a further step.

LAPTM4B may be a novel therapeutic target for cancer treatment
Although many kinds of molecular targeting drugs have been
developed, some targeting therapies may be ineffective and
require additional targets such as LAPTM4B for cancer treatment.
Although EGFR TKIs block the cellular functions mediated by EGFR
kinase signaling in non-small cell lung cancers, they also activate a
role for inactive EGFR in autophagy at the mean while, which
could potentially provide a survival advantage and TKI resistance
in cancers. Thus, cotargeting EGFR and other molecular may be a
promising strategy to overcome TKI resistance in cancers.
LAPTM4B as an oncogene, which promotes active EGFR signaling
in cancer cells and be necessary in the progression of autophagy
initiated by inactive EGFR, could be a cotargeting molecular in
cancer treatment.62 In addition, restraining LAPTM4B from
activating AKT signaling to suppress cell proliferation, breaking
the interaction between LAPTM4B and SH3 domain-containing
proteins to control cancer invasion and metastasis, inhibiting
LAPTM4B to decrease late endosome ceramide export to
ameliorate antiapoptosis condition and dissociating the LAPTM4B
from the efﬂux pump P-glycoprotein to attenuate chemotherapy
resistance can be potential cancer treatments.
Outstanding questions about LAPTM4B in cancer research
As we all know, LAPTM4B allele *2 contains an extra tandemly
arranged 19 -bp sequence at the 5ʹ-UTR, which results in a 40- kDa
protein. However, the function of the 40- kDa protein in cancer
cells and the relation of the 40- kDa protein with the disease risk
are not clear now. In addition, whether there are some different
translocation modiﬁcations between two alleles affecting their
function in tumor susceptibility is also unknown.
CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTIVE
LAPTM4B as a gene has been demonstrated to be a positive
modulator in the progression of carcinogenesis. It is suggested
that LAPTM4B has a key role in tumor proliferation, invasion and

metastasis, anti-apoptosis, autophagy promotion and multidrug
resistance. The protein of LAPTM4B gene, LAPTM4B-35, has been
certiﬁed to be a poor prognostic factor in many kinds of solid
tumors.
LAPTM4B may become the new target of cancer therapy. In
particular, in recent researches, the relationship between EGFR
signaling and LAPTM4B indicated that LAPTM4B can facilitate
prosurvival functions of EGFR in cancer cells and be regarded as a
therapeutic target for EGFR-positive cancers or a combined target
for anti-EGFR therapies.
