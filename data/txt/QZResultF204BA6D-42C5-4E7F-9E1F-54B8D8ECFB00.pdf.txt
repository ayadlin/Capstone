Impact of Chemotherapy on Quality of Life
in Patients With Metastatic Esophagogastric
Cancer
Salah-Eddin Al-Batran, MD1 and Jaffer A. Ajani, MD2

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a key issue in patients with metastatic esophagogastric cancer, a disease associated with survival times rarely exceeding 10 months. The objective of the current review was to
evaluate the effects of chemotherapy on the HRQoL of patients with metastatic or locally advanced, inoperable
esophagogastric cancer. METHODS: A systematic MEDLINE search was performed to address a predefined question
list: Does chemotherapy improve or maintain HRQoL? Do available data favor a particular chemotherapy? What relation exists between HRQoL and the efficacy and tolerability of therapy? RESULTS: The majority of studies, including
large randomized studies, indicated no significant improvements in mean HRQoL scores versus baseline after chemotherapy. However, scores were maintained and symptomatic relief or improved performance status was observed in
many patients. HRQoL was maintained in approximately 50% of patients for up to 6 months but deteriorated in the
remaining patients. In randomized phase 3 trials, only cisplatin/fluorouracil plus either docetaxel or epirubicin were
found to provide superior HRQoL versus comparators. Between-regimen differences in HRQoL scores appeared to
correspond to differences in the efficacy rather than the toxicity of treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy maintained HRQoL in a substantial proportion of patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer. This effect

Although combination chemotherapy can extend overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic esophagogastric
cancer (EGC), the 1-year and 2-year survival rates rarely exceed 45% and 20%, respectively, and chemotherapy is generally palliative. In this poor-prognosis population, it is vital that survival benefits should not be achieved at the expense of
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Conversely, chemotherapy may improve tumor-related symptoms, prolong symptom-free intervals, and consequently improve or maintain HRQoL. Despite the finding that HRQoL has been included
in many clinical studies of metastatic EGC, oncologists still have conflicting views concerning how chemotherapy affects
HRQoL in this disease.
This review of published literature was undertaken to assess studies reporting the effects of chemotherapy on the
HRQoL of patients with metastatic or locally advanced, inoperable EGC. Three questions were addressed: Does chemotherapy improve or maintain HRQoL? Do available HRQoL data favor a particular chemotherapy schedule? What relation exists between HRQoL and the efficacy and tolerability of therapy?

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature searches were conducted using PubMed with the following terms: (gastric OR esophageal OR esophagogastric
OR gastroesophageal) AND (cancer OR carcinoma) AND (‘‘quality of life’’ OR HRQoL OR ‘‘health-related quality of
life’’ OR ‘‘patient reported outcome’’) AND chemotherapy. Searches were limited to clinical studies published between
January 1988 and June 2008 and in the English language. Abstracts were reviewed manually to identify those relevant to
chemotherapy clinical trials with HRQoL as an endpoint. Unpublished data and data published in abstract form only

were excluded, because these were unlikely to contain sufficient methodologic information to allow valid conclusions to be made.
These searches identified 92 publications. Primary
manual searches led to the elimination of 51 publications
for the following reasons: duplication (n ¼ 9), studies performed in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting (n ¼ 12),
treatment other than chemotherapy (n ¼ 9), HRQoL not
reported (n ¼ 11), and tumors other than gastric or
esophageal (n ¼ 10). The remaining 41 publications were
examined to ascertain whether sufficient HRQoL data (vs
baseline and/or vs comparator regimens) were included.
This led to the elimination of a further 22 articles because
they did not include any systematic evaluation of HRQoL
as a clinical endpoint. The remaining 19 articles were analyzed for this review.

RESULTS
HRQoL During Chemotherapy Versus
Baseline
Improvements in mean global HRQoL scores after chemotherapy compared with baseline were reported in 7 trials
(Table 1).1-7 However, these trials were relatively small,
none was a phase 3 study, and they included a total of
only 368 patients. By contrast, a lack of improvement in
QoL mean scores compared with baseline was reported
in 11 trials that included a total of 2164 patients.2,4,5,8-15
Nearly all of the trials that did not demonstrate QoL
improvements versus baseline were randomized, and
many were phase 3 (Table 2). In the majority of the trials,
mean scores of HRQoL were maintained.

It is important to note that many studies demonstrated symptomatic relief or improved Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status.6,8,10,11,13,16,17 Indeed, Findlay et al16 found that
44 of 66 (67%) patients with dysphagia experienced a
complete resolution of symptoms with epirubicin plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (ECF), and Kim et al17 reported
that the high response rate observed with 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) plus cisplatin was associated with a high proportion of patients who had improved performance status
and/or had improved nutritional status. Although Tebbutt et al10 found no between-group differences with
regard to global QoL during the administration of 5-FU
or 5-FU plus mitomycin C, symptomatic benefit as
assessed by improvement in pain control, weight loss, dysphagia, and esophageal reflux was observed in >64% of
patients in each arm.
Given that the majority of studies demonstrated that
HRQoL scores were maintained during chemotherapy
and/or follow-up, a significant decline in mean global
HRQoL scores versus baseline was rarely observed. However, it should be noted that HRQoL measures were not
available for every patient at each assessment point during
the studies. Indeed, from all studies reporting the number
of patients with assessable HRQoL data by time point, the
proportion of patients ranged from 68% to 100% (median, 94%) at baseline, 35% to 90% (median, 65%) at
first evaluation, and 20% to 80% (median, 52%) at second evaluation.1-5,7,8,11,13 It is very likely that the majority of patients who did not undergo HRQoL assessments
at each scheduled time point had experienced disease progression or deterioration in general health status and thus

it is probable that this patient subgroup had inferior
HRQoL versus baseline after chemotherapy. This is supported by the results of the few studies (n ¼ 3) that
included a time-to-event analysis from which time to
deterioration of global health status was calculated.11-13
These studies clearly demonstrated that HRQoL was
maintained in 50% of the patient populations for between
4.2 months and 6.5 months, but deteriorated in the
remaining patients.11-13 It is interesting that the study by
Glimelius et al,13 which compared chemotherapy against
best supportive care (BSC), reported no between-group
differences in mean European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life
Questionnaire core 30 items (EORTC-C30) scores.
Time-to-event analysis, however, demonstrated that
HRQoL was maintained for 6 months with chemotherapy versus 2 months for BSC during treatment. Similarly,
the study by Ajani et al,11 in which time to definitive deterioration was analyzed, demonstrated that HRQoL was
preserved longer in patients receiving docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-FU (DCF) than in those receiving cisplatin
plus 5-FU (CF), although no between-group differences
were observed with regard to mean EORTC-C30 scores

(unpublished data). The discrepancy between HRQoL
measures is probably due to the finding that patients experiencing deteriorating health or disease progression are
less likely to be able to complete the HRQoL questionnaire, creating a bias as only patients with a favorable clinical development would be assessed from both treatment
arms. Thus, HRQoL scores are most likely to be maintained only in a subgroup of patients.
HRQoL Comparison Between Regimens
Despite no between-group differences in mean EORTCC30 scores being observed in the study by Glimelius et al,13
the comparison of etoposide plus 5-FU/leucovorin (LV)
(ELF) plus BSC (n ¼ 30) was found to improve HRQoL
for a minimum period of 4 months compared with BSC
alone (n ¼ 31) (45% vs 20%; P <.05), as assessed by 2 independent raters using a study-specific assessment form. In
addition, the average quality-adjusted survival (survival
time with maintained or improved QoL) was found to be
longer in the chemotherapy group than in the BSC group
(median, 6 months vs 2 months; P ¼ .03).13
From the other phase 3 trials identified, only a small
proportion of treatment schedules was found to provide

superior HRQoL outcomes with regard to the comparator
regimen(s). In the study by Ajani et al,11 time to 5% deterioration of global health status was significantly
improved with DCF (n ¼ 221) versus CF (n ¼ 224) (6.5
months vs 4.2 months; P ¼ .01). Furthermore, all the
analyses for time to 10%, 20%, and 30% deterioration for
physical functioning, social functioning, nausea/vomiting, and the pain parameters were significantly superior
for DCF, demonstrating that HRQoL was preserved longer with DCF.11 It is interesting to note that these
improvements versus CF occurred despite the finding that
DCF was associated with significantly higher rates of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhea.18 In an earlier
trial with ECF versus 5-FU, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX), ECF was found to significantly improve
mean global HRQoL scores at 24 weeks (P ¼ .04),
although no between-group differences were observed for
any other HRQoL score.8 Between-group differences
were also observed for ECF versus mitomycin plus

global QoL scores were maintained by ECF but declined

with MCF after 3 months (P <.001) and 6 months (P ¼
.015). Thus, to the best of our knowledge, DCF and
ECF are the only 2 regimens that have demonstrated
superior HRQoL results versus comparators in the larger
trials.
To our knowledge, there have been no head-to-head
comparisons within phase 3 trials between DCF and ECF
with respect to HRQoL or efficacy. However, 2 phase 2
trials were identified. In 1 study, DCF (n ¼ 36) was associated with improved social functioning (P ¼ .03) and
nausea/vomiting (P ¼ .01) subscales versus ECF (n ¼
35), although no between-group differences were
observed for the other domains.5 By contrast, in the other
phase 2 study, Roth et al2 reported improvements from
baseline in global health status/QoL with ECF (n ¼ 40;
median change, 16.7), whereas scores for patients receiving DCF (n ¼ 40) remained similar to baseline (treatment–time interaction, P <.05). Both studies included
small populations, and the HRQoL assessments were not
powered for formal treatment comparisons. Therefore,
the results should be interpreted with caution.

Relation Between HRQoL and Efficacy and
Toxicity Measures
For each phase 3 study identified, a comparison between
the primary efficacy and safety endpoints versus HRQoL
outcomes was performed. Table 3 shows the comparison
of efficacy and HRQoL outcomes for all identified phase
3 studies. Overall, 7 trials were identified for inclusion.
Three (including 5 experimental arms) of the 7 trials demonstrated no between-group differences in HRQoL.
Three additional studies reported an improvement in
HRQoL for the experimental arm, whereas the experimental arm was found to be inferior to the control in 1
study. It is interesting that, in all 3 studies in which
superior HRQoL scores were reported with the experi-

Cancer

mental arms, these arms also demonstrated significantly
improved efficacy outcomes over the standard arms.8,11,13
Six experimental regimens demonstrated equal efficacy
with the corresponding control arms, 5 of which were also
associated with equal HRQoL outcomes,10,12,19 whereas
HRQoL scores were inferior in 1 study.9 Thus, the
improvements in efficacy appeared to result in better
patient HRQoL.8,11,13 The link between better efficacy
outcomes and improved patient HRQoL is further supported by the correlation between improved time to disease progression (TTP) and improved time to
deterioration of HRQoL that was observed in the studies
by Glimelius et al13 and Ajani et al (the V325 study).11 In
the latter study, the TTP was 5.6 months versus 3.7

2515

Review Article

months (P < .001) and time to 5% deterioration of global
health status was 6.5 months versus 4.2 months (P ¼
.012) for DCF versus CF, respectively.11 Glimelius et al13
demonstrated that median quality-adjusted survival
(which reflects the time to deterioration of HRQoL) was
longer in patients receiving chemotherapy plus BSC than
in those receiving BSC alone (median, 6 months vs 2
months; P ¼ .03). This finding correlated well with an
identical difference in median TTP favoring the chemotherapy arm. A similar correlation was observed in the
phase 3 study comparing irinotecan plus 5-FU/LV versus
CF published by Dank et al12 In this study, there was a
statistically nonsignificant trend toward improved TTP
favoring the irinotecan-based chemotherapy (5.0 months
vs 4.2 months; P ¼ .09), which was also associated with a
similar trend toward an improved time to 5% deterioration in EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D) score favoring
the same treatment arm (5.6 months vs 4.1 months; P ¼
.069).12
By contrast, treatment schedules with a worse toxicity profile than the control arm were not associated with
worsening HRQoL outcomes (Table 4). Indeed, 2 of the
3 studies reporting increased toxicity with the experimental treatment also demonstrated improved HRQoL scores
(Table 4).11,13 The other study reported improvements
for both toxicity and HRQoL measures for ECF versus
the FAMTX regimen (Table 4).8 However, in this study,
ECF improved efficacy as well.

DISCUSSION
Treatment decisions for patients with EGC should take
into account both the efficacy of a therapy and its impact
on HRQoL, because both the length and the quality of
remaining life are important to patients. We believe that
the current study provides a thorough and timely evaluation of the use of HRQoL assessments in patients with
metastatic EGC, investigating HRQoL outcomes by
treatment regimen and the association of HRQoL with efficacy and toxicity endpoints.
The published literature often includes statements
that chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves QoL
in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. The results from
the current study indicate that chemotherapy does not
improve HRQoL from baseline in patients with EGC.
From the 19 studies identified, only small-scale studies
reported improved HRQoL with chemotherapy regimens
compared with baseline measures, and to the best of our
knowledge, no phase 3 studies to date have reported such
improvements.

2516

Given the small number of patients involved in the
studies reporting better HRQoL versus baseline, it is possible that statistical bias contributed to the positive outcomes. For example, in the study by Bouche et al,3 which
reported improved HRQoL with 5-FU/LV-based chemotherapy compared with baseline, data for global HRQoL
were available for fewer than 10 patients in each chemotherapy arm at follow-up. Study reports and the clinical
experience indicate that some patients achieve symptomatic relief during chemotherapy versus baseline. However, this patient population often corresponded to a
small subgroup (patients who had symptoms of disease
burden at baseline and experienced response to chemotherapy), resulting in a diminished effect on mean
HRQoL scores.
The results of the current study do indicate that
patient HRQoL can be maintained by chemotherapy.
From the studies selected, regimens including ELF, DCF,
ECF, and tegafur plus cisplatin all maintained global
HRQoL scores from baseline. It should be noted, however, that this finding is true only for the subgroup of
patients who remained in each study. The data from the
studies that included a time-to-event analysis demonstrated that HRQoL was maintained in approximately
50% of the patient population for up to 6 months, but
deteriorated in the remaining patients. Given the finding
that the median treatment duration in the majority of the
studies was approximately 4 months, the chemotherapyrelated costs in Germany would be approximately [euro]
6000 to [euro] 13,000 per patient, depending on the
chemotherapy regimen used.
The results of the current study demonstrate that
some chemotherapy regimens, in particular DCF or ECF,
are associated with better HRQoL outcomes than others,
in particular CF, FAMTX, and MCF. In the study comparing ECF with MCF,9 differences in HRQoL represented the most prominent finding and established ECF
as a standard regimen for the treatment of EGC, highlighting the value of HRQoL as a clinical endpoint.
The findings of the current study suggest that regimens that improve efficacy endpoints, including OS and
TTP, are associated with improved HRQoL (defined as
higher mean scores or longer preservation of HRQoL). In
contrast to efficacy outcomes, toxicity was not found to
directly affect HRQoL outcomes. These findings can be
explained by the finding that metastatic EGC is an aggressive and rapidly progressing disease. If chemotherapy fails,
tumor-related symptoms such as gastrointestinal obstruction and deterioration in ECOG performance status

immediately impact on patients’ HRQoL. This finding is
of particular interest because many oncologists do not use
the more intensive 3-drug combinations in EGC because
of concerns about increased toxicity and the patient’s
QoL.
Similarly, results from a colorectal cancer study indicate that QoL does not appear to be related to the toxicity
profile of the chemotherapy regimen.20 In a review of
phase 3 trials in colorectal cancer, only 2 of 11 studies
reported higher toxicity and worse HRQoL. There was no
correlation noted between toxicity and HRQoL for any of
the other studies assessed.20
A limitation of the current study is the unavoidable
fact that not all the studies identified for selection assessed
the same HRQoL endpoints. In addition, various methods were used with regard to the analysis of HRQoL data,
depending on the outcomes evaluated. For instance, timeto-event analysis tended to be the method used in recent
studies involving DCF and irinotecan plus 5-FU, whereas
studies of ECF compared mean HRQoL scores. It would
be beneficial if a consensus was met regarding the standard
method for HRQoL analyses. The use of time-to-event
analyses appears to be increasing. However, whether these
analyses are more accurate still needs to be confirmed.
The current study evaluating the use of HRQoL
assessments in patients with EGC has highlighted several
key findings and potential areas for further study. It was
found that chemotherapy regimens from the selected
studies tend to maintain rather than improve HRQoL.
Chemotherapy regimens associated with improved efficacy were associated with improved HRQoL outcomes
compared with comparator regimens, whereas toxicity did
not appear to directly affect HRQoL. It is clear that further studies including HRQoL as a predefined study endpoint are needed to fully assess the influence of different
chemotherapy regimens on HRQoL, enabling informed
treatment decisions to optimize treatment in patients with
EGC.
