ABSTRACT
Our previous study demonstrated NVP-AUY922, a HSP90AA1 inhibitor, could
enhance mutant KIT degradation in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells
through both proteasome- and autophagy-mediated pathways. Herein, we showed
rapamycin, a MTOR inhibitor and autophagy inducer, could reduce total and phosphoKIT expression levels and enhance apoptosis in imatinib-resistant GIST cells. The
involvement of autophagy in rapamycin-induced KIT downregulation was further
confirmed by co-localization of KIT and autophagosome, and partial recovery of KIT
expression level by either siRNA-mediated BECN1 and ATG5 silencing or autophagy
inhibitors after rapamycin. Rapamycin and NVP-AUY922 synergistically inhibited
GIST cells growth in vitro. The combination of low-dose NVP-AUY922 with rapamycin
had comparable effects on reducing KIT expression, increasing MAP1LC3B puncta
and tumor necrosis, and inhibiting tumor growth as high-dose NVP-AUY922 did in
GIST430 xenograft model. Our results suggest the addition of a MTOR inhibitor may
reduce NVP-AUY922 dose requirement and potentially improve its therapeutic index
in mutant KIT-expressing GISTs.

in the exon 11 juxtamembrane domain, followed by the
exon 9 extracellular domain, the exon 13/14 ATP-binding
domain, and the exon 17 activation loop domain [3-5].
Imatinib mesylate (IM; Gleevec®, Novartis Pharma,
Basel, Switzerland) and sunitinib malate (SU; Sutent®,
Pfizer Inc., CA, USA) are the first-line and second-line
drugs for metastatic/unresectable GISTs and IM-resistant
GISTs, respectively [6, 7]. In a pivotal phase III trial,

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the
most common type of mesenchymal neoplasms in the
gastrointestinal tract [1, 2]. Approximately 85% of GISTs
harbor gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA,
which lead to the promotion of cell survival and escape
from apoptosis. In GISTs, KIT mutations occur mainly

placebo control and has recently been approved as a thirdline drug for IM/SU-resistant GISTs [8]. Unfortunately,
TKI resistance remains an increasing issue after long-term
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. HSP90AA1, a
chaperone protein that assists the folding and maturation
of its client proteins, is an alternative therapeutic target
for cancer therapy [9-11]. Inhibition of HSP90AA1 by
17-AAG, the first HSP90AA1 inhibitor tested in clinical
trials, led to KIT downregulation and cell death in both
mutant KIT-expressing mast cells and GIST cell lines [12,
13].
However, 17-AAG has several pharmacological
limitations, including poor bioavailability, difficulty in
formulation, and hepatotoxicity to prevent its further
application in clinical setting. Therefore, we evaluated the
anti-proliferation effects of a next-generation HSP90AA1
inhibitor, NVP-AUY922 (AUY922), which has high
affinity against HSP90AA1 in vitro, for mutant KIT
expressing GIST cell in our previous study [14-17]. In that
study, AUY922 effectively downregulated both total and
phosphorylated KIT and induced cell apoptosis in both
IM-sensitive and IM-resistant GIST cells. However, it was
surprisingly to find that AUY922-induced KIT reduction
as well as endogenous KIT turnover, were mediated by
both autophagy and proteasome degradation pathways.
These results highlight the feasibility of AUY922 in the
treatment of mutant KIT-expressing GISTs and the novel
role of autophagy in endogenous and AUY922-induced
KIT degradation. However, despite the high antitumor
activity of AUY922 against GIST cells, AUY922 therapy
at dose of 70 mg/m2 weekly infusion, the maximum
tolerated dose defined in phase I trial, was associated
with unneglectable ocular adverse events, including night
blindness, photopsia, blurred vision and visual impairment
[18].
Based on our previous findings, we hypothesize that
the combination of AUY922 with an autophagy inducer
that may synergistically or additively enhance KIT
downregulation, and thus diminish the dose of AUY922 for
GIST treatment and subsequently minimize the incidence
and severity of ocular adverse events. Classically,
mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) kinase is the
well-known modulator of autophagy in human cells.
Inhibition of MTOR leading to autophagy activation
has been demonstrated as a therapeutic mechanism for
various cancer types [19-22]. Rapamycin, a MTOR
inhibitor that widely used as an immunosuppressant in
organ-transplanted patients, was able to induce autophagy
and enhance degradation of aggregate-prone proteins,
including huntingtin in several Huntington’s disease
models [23-25]. Moreover, rapamycin has also been
demonstrated antitumor activity through the induction
of autophagy in malignant gliomas and chronic myeloid
leukemia [21, 22]. Numerous clinical trials are undergoing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to investigating its effects as autophagy modulators either
alone or in combination with standard drug therapy
for various cancer types, including pancreatic cancer,
advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma, and melanoma
[26].
In this study, we investigated whether the
combination of AUY922 and rapamycin would be a
potential strategy to improve the therapeutic index of
AUT922 in mutant KIT-expressing GISTs. We evaluated
the effect of rapamycin alone and the potential synergism
between AUY922 and rapamycin on induction of
autophagy activation, KIT reduction and growth inhibition
in IM-resistant, mutant KIT-expression GIST cells both in
vitro and in vivo. These results represent a strategy toward
optimizing the use of AUY922 for TKI-resistant GISTs.

RESULTS
Rapamycin induced autophagy, downregulated
KIT expression, and led to cell apoptosis
Initially, we examined the inhibitory effects of
rapamycin in GIST cells. The data showed that 10 µM
rapamycin effectively reduced phospho-RPS6KB1, a
downstream MTOR target molecule, and that 10 to 40 µM
rapamycin induced clear MAP1LC3B accumulation, an
index of autophagy activity, in both GIST48 and GIST430
cells. (Fig. 1A) These findings were accompanied by
downregulation of phospho- and total KIT and KITmodulated phospho-AKT in both GIST48 and GIST430
cells, but phospho-MAPK1/3 only in GIST430 cells. In
the time series experiments, 40 µM rapamycin abolished
phospho-RPS6KB1 level after 4 h of exposure in both
GIST cell lines. (Fig. 1B) Phospho-KIT and phospho-AKT
were clearly downregulated at 8 h in GIST48 cells and at
24 h in GIST430 cells, which was consistent with the time
course of MAP1LC3B accumulation. In GIST430 cells,
40 µM rapamycin reduced phospho-MAPK1/3 at 24 h,
which was consistent with phospho-KIT downregulation,
but phospho-MAPK1/3 was not decreased after rapamycin
treatment in GIST48 cells. These results imply that
phospho-MAPK1/3 could be activated by other signaling
cascades in GIST48 cells.
The rapamycin drug concentrations that inhibited
cell viability by 50% (IC50) were 12.2 and 13.2 µM for
GIST48 and GIST430 cells, respectively. (Fig. 1C) In
the colony formation assay, the IC50 of rapamycin were
2.48 µM and 6.67 µM for GIST48 and GIST430 cells,
respectively. (Fig. 1D) Then, we examined the effect of
rapamycin on the induction of GIST cell death. Fig. 1E
showed that in GIST48 cells, 40 µM rapamycin induced
Annexin V-positive cells in 11.50%, 30.10%, 38.52%, and
74.09% of total cells after 0, 12, 24, and 48 h of incubation,
respectively, and Annexin V-positive/PI-negative cells

were 4.72%, 17.08%, 6.24%, and 5.52%, respectively. For
GIST430 cells, the Annexin V-positive cells constituted
10.37%, 26.06%, 36.07%, and 67.74% of total cells,
respectively, and Annexin V-positive/PI-negative cells
constituted 3.86%, 11.98%, 15.19%, and 24.79% of cells
after 0, 12, 24, and 48 h of 40 µM rapamycin incubation,
respectively. Moreover, rapamycin induced PARP1
cleavage in the same treatment condition in both GIST cell
lines. (Fig. 1F) These results demonstrate that rapamycin
alone could downregulate phospho- and total KIT and
induce apoptosis.

bafilomycin A1 for 4 h and then incubated with 40 µM
rapamycin for an additional 8 and 24 h for GIST48
and GIST430 cells, respectively. The data showed that
rapamycin-induced KIT downregulation could be partially
rescued by 3-MA or bafilomycin A1 in both GIST48 and
GIST430 cells. (Fig. 2A) To further confirm the role of
autophagy in rapamycin-induced KIT downregulation,
we independently silenced the expression of two
proteins essential for autophagosome formation, BECN1
and ATG5, and found that rapamycin-induced KIT
reduction was diminished in BECN1- or ATG5-deficient
GIST48 and GIST430 cells. (Fig. 2B and C) Using
immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy
analysis, we found no obvious nonspecific staining in
normal rabbit, goat, or mouse antibody-incubated cells.
After treatment of both GIST cells, rapamycin clearly led
to more puncta of MAP1LC3B and more aggregates of
SQSTM1, an index of autophagosome, as well as KIT
condensation and aggregation. (Fig. 2D-G) Furthermore,
the aggregates of SQSTM1 and accumulation of
MAP1LC3B-labeled autophagosomes co-localized with

Rapamycin-induced KIT reduction occurred
through enhancement of autophagy
Because the inhibition of MTOR influenced
protein synthesis, transcription, and autophagy activity,
we investigated whether the rapamycin-induced KIT
reduction is a result of autophagy activation. Cells

indicated doses, and IC50 was determined by the cell viability assay (C) and clonogenic assay (D). GIST430 and GIST48 cells were treated

were repeated at least three times. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of two or more independent experiments.

expression levels in GIST430 cells after incubation for
0.5 h. KIT downstream signaling was assessed by levels
of phospho-MAPK and phospho-AKT and was found to
be inactivated, consistent with phospho-KIT suppression.
After drug exposure for 8 h, AUY922 elevated HSPA1A
expression in a dose-dependent manner in a range from
0.05 to 1 µM, and it simultaneously reduced phospho- and
total KIT proteins in GIST430 cells. (Fig. 3A) Consistent
with phospho-KIT downregulation, the phosphoMAPK1/3 and phospho-AKT levels were also decreased
in GIST430 cells.
To examine the antitumor activity of AUY922 in
GIST430 cells, cells were incubated with AUY922 and
then analyzed using the cell viability assay (Fig. 3B) and
the clonogenic assay. (Fig. 3C) The IC50 of AUY922 was
32 nM for both the cell viability assay and clonogenic
assay. Then, we treated GIST430 cells with 0.1 µM
AUY922 for 12 to 48 h to determine whether AUY922
could induce apoptosis. After AUY922 treatment for 0,

AUY922 downregulated phospho- and total KIT
expression and induced apoptosis
In previous studies, we demonstrated that AUY922
reduces KIT expression in IM-sensitive GIST882 and
IM-resistant GIST48 cells. In the present study, we first
assessed whether AUY922 could reduce phospho- and
total KIT in another IM-resistant GIST430 cells. The
data showed that 1 µM AUY922 elevated the level of
HSPA1A expression in a time-dependent manner, which
is a positive indicator of HSP90AA1 inhibition. (Fig. 3A)
This result suggests that AUY922 effectively inhibited
HSP90AA1 activity in GIST430 cells. Moreover,
AUY922 downregulated the phospho- and total KIT

12, 24, or 48 h, Annexin V-positive cells were in 10.52%,
29.05%, 50.64%, and 71.54% of total cell population,
respectively, and Annexin V-positive/PI-negative cells
were in 5.63%, 7.58%, 16.88%, and 26.63% of total
cell population, respectively. (Fig. 3D) Furthermore, 0.1
µM AUY922 induced PARP1 cleavage with incubation
times ranging from 12 to 48 h. (Fig. 3E) These findings
indicate that AUY922 is highly effective in reducing KIT
expression in GIST430 cells, similar to its previously
reported effects in GIST48 and GIST882 cells.

Next, we examined whether the drug combination of
rapamycin and AUY922 could achieve better effects
on KIT downregulation and cell death than each drug
treatment alone. In GIST48 cells, 0.005 to 1 µM AUY922
combined with 40 µM rapamycin more robustly reduced
KIT expression after 8 h of incubation than rapamycin
or AUY922 alone. (Fig. 4A) In GIST430 cells, the drug
combination of 0.005 to 1 µM AUY922/40 µM rapamycin
similarly had stronger effects on KIT downregulation than
each drug independently. (Fig. 4B) In GIST48 cells, 20
nM AUY922/5 µM rapamycin treatment increased the
proportion of Annexin V-positive cells from 6.27% to
20.33%, 40.78%, and 52.13% after 12, 24, and 48 h of
incubation, respectively, as compared with that of after
either rapamycin (5.38%, 5.54%, and 6.36%) or AUY922
(15.04%, 28.75%, and 35.93%) alone. (Fig. 4C) In

Rapamycin enhanced AUY922-induced KIT

KIT reduction and cell death via autophagy activation.

for 8 h. Cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting against KIT and MAP1LC3. Relative KIT expression was normalized to
ACTIN and compared with that of the untreated control. Cells were treated with 20 nM AUY922 and 5 µM rapamycin, either alone or in
combination, for 12 to 48 h and analyzed by Annexin V staining (C). Cells were treated with various concentrations of AUY922 combined
with rapamycin (D). Cell growth was determined by the methylene blue dye assay as described in the Materials and Methods section. The
interaction between AUY922 and rapamycin at the IC50 point was analyzed using the isobologram method. The data are expressed as the
mean ± S.E. of two or more independent experiments.

The combination of low-dose AUY922 and
rapamycin achieved comparable tumor growth
inhibition as high-dose AUY922

GIST430 cells, the Annexin V-positive cell fraction did
not significantly altered after 12 or 24 h exposure to study
drugs, but it increased to 39.56% after 48 h incubation with
20 nM AUY922/5 µM rapamycin as compared with that
of 16.18% and 28.7% after 5 µM rapamycin alone and 20
nM AUY922 alone, respectively. To further evaluate the
potential synergy between AUY922 and rapamycin, the
effect of drug combination on cell viability in GIST48 and
GIST430 cells was analyzed. Fig. 4D showed that the drug
combination achieved a lower IC50 than either drug alone,
implying that AUY922 and rapamycin had a synergistic
effect on the viability of both GIST48 and GIST430 cells.
In summary, rapamycin enhances AUY922-induced KIT
downregulation, cell apoptosis, and cell viability in GIST
cells.

The synergism between AUY922 and rapamycin in
inhibiting the growth of GIST cells in vitro was further
evaluated in GIST430 xenograft animal model. Based on
previous studies of AUY922 for cancer xenograft models,
AUY922 at a dose of 25 mg/kg (high-dose) twice weekly
i.p. for 4 weeks was firstly explored. Our results showed
that mice with 25 mg/kg b.i.w. of AUY922 treatment
had significantly lower tumor volumes as compared with
the DMSO-treated control group (data not shown). To
assess drug synergism, the concentration of AUY922 was
reduced to 12.5 mg/kg (low-dose) in a combination with

Figure 5: The effect of AUY922 either alone or in a combination with rapamycin in the GIST430 xenograft animal
model. The GIST430 xenograft was established as described in Materials and Methods. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of
DMSO, AUY922 25 mg/kg twice weekly, AUY922 12.5 mg/kg twice weekly, rapamycin 3 mg/kg twice weekly, or a combination of
AUY922 and rapamycin for 4 weeks. (A) The tumor volume was determined as 1/2 x length (mm) x width (mm)2. The dissected tumors
were collected at the end of drug administration (B) and then analyzed by H&E staining (D) and immunohistochemical staining against
KIT, MAP1LC3B, HIF1A, or PECAM1 (E). The necrotic areas of the tumor specimens were determined by quantification, as shown in (C).

rapamycin for experimental arms. Mice were treated with
DMSO (placebo control), high-dose AUY922 b.i.w. (active
control), and low-dose AUY922 b.i.w., 3 mg/kg rapamycin
b.i.w., or a combination of both. The mean tumor volumes
in corresponding group of mice were 1232.94, 112.00,
325.71, 348.31, and 185.03 mm3, respectively. (Fig. 5A)
At the end of treatment, the tumor volume of mice with
high-dose AUY922 was significantly smaller than those
with low-dose AUY922 (p= 0.004) or rapamycin (p=
0.002). While the mean tumor volume was comparable,
there is no significantly different between mice treated
with high-dose AUY922 and those with low-dose AUY922
and rapamycin combo. Immunohistochemical staining
of tumor tissue sections from the GIST430 xenograft
revealed that low-dose AUY922/rapamycin combo, as
well as high-dose AUY922, induced more prominent
tumor necrosis, as visualized by hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining, and achieved a more pronounced effect
on KIT downregulation and MAP1LC3B accumulation
than low-dose AUY922 or rapamycin alone in vivo. (Fig.
5C-E) Moreover, a marker of angiogenesis (platelet/
endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, PECAM1) and a key
component of this pathway (hypoxia inducible factor 1A,
HIF1A) were both more obviously reduced in the tumor
tissue from the high-dose AUY922 alone and low-dose
AUY922/rapamycin treated mice compared with those
from each treatment alone.

is currently under clinical investigation for TKI-refractory
GIST. However, the occurrence of ocular adverse events,
notably night blindness, frequently leads to treatment
interruption and/or dose reduction in our phase II study.
Developing a novel strategy to increase the therapeutic
index of HSP90AA1 inhibitor will be critical for future
development of this class of compounds in patients with
TKI-refractory GISTs [17]. In our previous study, we
showed that AUY922-induced KIT downregulation was
via both proteasome and autophagy degradation pathways.
In current study, we demonstrated that rapamycin, a
MTOR inhibitor and inducer of autophagy, could reduce
the expression of both phospho- and total KIT in time- and
dose-dependent manners, and thus enhance the apoptosis
of KIT-expressing GIST cells. AUY922 and rapamycin
synergistically enhanced KIT downregulation and growth
inhibition as compared with individual drug alone.
These findings suggest that combining AUY922 with an
autophagy inducer can be a potential therapeutic strategy
for TKI-refractory GISTs.
Inhibition of MTOR that leads to autophagy
activation has been demonstrated as a therapeutic approach
for cancers in many studies. Temsirolimus, an inhibitor
of MTOR, induces autophagy and cell cycle arrest to
result in proliferation inhibition of mantle cell lymphoma
[19]. Another MTOR inhibitor, everolimus, also induces
autophagy and cell cycle arrest and improves the median
survival of mice harboring human childhood B-cell
progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia [20]. Takeuchi et
al. and Carayol et al. also showed that rapamycin exhibits
an antitumor effect by inducing autophagy in malignant
glioma cells and malignant chronic myeloid leukemia,
respectively [21, 22]. In our study, high concentrations of
rapamycin, up to 10 to 40 µM, were required to induce
clear MAP1LC3B accumulation. (Fig. 1A) Typically,
rapamycin is known to inhibit phospho-RPS6KB1 and cell
proliferation under nM concentration [35, 36]. However,
recent studies suggested that low-does (nM) and highdose (µM) of rapamycin had different target and effects
on cancer cells. Low-dose rapamycin can inhibit MTOR
complex 1 (MTORC1) and lead to cell growth inhibition.
On the other hand, much higher dose (at µM range) is
required to suppress MTOR complex 2 (MTORC2) and
induce cell apoptosis [37]. Yellen P. et al. showed that
high-dose (µM) rapamycin-induced cell apoptosis was
closely associated with the suppression of EIF4EBP1
phosphorylation [38]. Based on these findings, rapamycin
induced autophagy and cell apoptosis at high-dose is
probably through inhibiting MTORC2 and its downstream
EIF4EBP1.
MTOR also plays a dominant role in nutrient
sensing and the regulation of cell growth. Further studies
have demonstrated that protein synthesis factors that
lie downstream of MTOR affect cell proliferation and
survival, cell-cycle progression, angiogenesis, energy
metabolism, and metastasis [39]. Therefore, MTOR

DISCUSSION
Recently, HSP90AA1 has been shown to be a novel
target for cancer therapy because its inhibition can enhance
the degradation of its client proteins, typically receptor
tyrosine kinases, signaling molecules and kinases, and
transcription factors, to result in modulating many crucial
cell functions, including survival, proliferation, metastasis,
angiogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis
[27]. Although many HSP90AA1 inhibitors exhibited
antitumor activity against GIST in vitro, only IPI-504,
STA-9090, BIIB021, and AUY922 have been evaluated
as single-agent therapies for GIST refractory to IM and
SU in vivo [28-31]. IPI-504, a derivative of 17-AAG,
has displayed antitumor activity against TKI-refractory
GISTs, but its clinical trial was early terminated because
of the occurrence of on-treatment deaths along with severe
unexpected adverse events including renal and liver
failure, metabolic acidosis, and cardiopulmonary arrest
[28, 32]. Of the phase II study of STA-9090 in patients
with metastatic GISTs showed that weekly administration
of STA-9090 was not sufficient to inhibit KIT activity and
its downstream pathways [33]. BIIB021 achieved a 22%
overall metabolic response rate according to 18 fluoro2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDGPET), while the objective tumor response rate was 0%
and 4% by RECIST and Choi’s criteria, respectively [34].

as a developing therapeutic target for cancer treatment
with many rapamycin analogues (rapalogs) have been
submitted to clinical trials in recently years. In 2007,
temsirolimus was the first MTOR inhibitor to be approved
by the FDA for the treatment of advanced-stage renal
cell carcinoma. Subsequently, several MTOR inhibitors
have been evaluated for the treatment of various cancers
in phase III clinical trials, including Non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, neuroendocrine tumors, gastric cancer,
sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and
etc. [40]. Everolimus, an oral form of MTOR inhibitor,
has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of GIST cell
in human GISTs xenograft model [41, 42]. In a phase I–II
study, the combination of everolimus with IM, at dose of
2.5 mg and 600 mg daily, respectively, could achieve a
median progression-free survival and overall survival of
3.5 months and 10.7 months, respectively, in patients with
IM/SU-resistant GISTs [43].
In our study, we also found that combination
of AUY922 and rapamycin could more effectively
downregulate KIT expression and inhibit tumor growth in
IM-resistant GIST cells in vitro and in vivo compared with
individual drug alone. (Fig. 4 and 5) However, induction
of autophagy activation and KIT downregulation may
not be the only synergistic/additive effects exerted by
the combination of AUY922 and rapamycin on GIST430
xenograft model in mice. As shown in Fig. 5, GIST
430 xenograft tumors in mice with either AUY922 or
rapamycin alone, or in a combination had less PRCAM1
staining-positive blood vessels as well as HIF1A
expression than the control tumors. HIF1A, the most
potent pro-angiogenic protein that drives the expression of
several angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), is one of the client proteins of
HSP90AA1. Inhibition of HSP90AA1 could enhance
proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF1A followed
by downregulation of HIF-mediated VEGF expression
and angiogenesis [44, 45]. Furthermore, several studies
have demonstrated that HSP90AA1 inhibitors decrease
VEGF secretion from cancer cells, impair endothelial
cell tubule formation in vitro, and reduce tumor size and
vascularization in vivo [46, 47]. MTOR has also been
shown to regulate the transcription and translation of
HIF1A [48]. Inhibition of MTOR-induced anti-angiogenic
and antitumor effects has been shown to mediate through
the reduction of VEGF production and diminished
vessel sprouting in tumors [49]. Moreover, Mercier et al.
demonstrated that rapamycin treatment could decrease
stromal content in tumor animal model [50]. Taken
together, the combination of a HSP90AA1 inhibitor and a
MTOR inhibitor not only activates autophagy, leading to
KIT downregulation, but also likely exerts anti-angiogenic
effects that to contribute to tumor growth inhibition in vivo
in our study.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that rapamycin
alone can enhance autophagy and induce KIT protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

downregulation and apoptosis in both IM-resistant
GIST48 and GIST430 cells. Rapamycin-induced KIT
degradation via the autophagy pathway was supported
by co-localization of KIT with MAP1LC3B or SQSTM1
after drug incubation. In addition, blockage of autophagy
by pharmacological inhibition or silencing of essential
autophagy-related proteins could partially rescue
rapamycin-induced KIT downregulation. The combination
of AUY922 and rapamycin enhanced KIT reduction and
GIST cell killing compared with each treatment alone.
Furthermore, high-dose (25 mg/kg) of AUY922 could
achieve significant better tumor growth inhibition than
either low-dose (12.5 mg/kg) AUY922 or rapamycin
3 mg/kg monotherapy; while the low-dose AUY922/
rapamycin combo had similar tumor growth inhibition as
high-dose (25 mg/kg) of AUY922 did, as shown in Fig.
5. Our data highlight the combination of AUY922 and
an autophagy inducer, such as rapamycin, is a potential
treatment strategy for TKI-refractory, KIT-expressing
GISTs and deserves further study in clinical setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, chemicals, and antibodies
GIST430 and GIST48 cells encoding the exon
11V560_L576del (het)/13V654A and exon 11V560D/17D820A mutant
KIT oncoprotein, respectively, were gifts from Dr.
Jonathan Fletcher (Harvard Medical School, USA).
AUY922 was kindly supplied by Novartis. Rapamycin,
3-MA, bafilomycin A1, CelLyticTM cell lysis reagent, and
rabbit anti-MAP1LC3A/B were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich. Primary antibodies against KIT and phosphoKIT (Tyr703) were obtained from DAKO and Invitrogen,
respectively. Antibodies against RPS6KB1, phosphoRPS6KB1 (Thr389), MAPK1/3, phospho-MAPK1/3
(Tyr204/Thr202), AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser473),
BECN1, and ATG5 were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology. Normal rabbit IgG, normal goat IgG, normal
mouse IgG, goat anti-MAP1LC3B, rabbit anti-PARP1,
and mouse anti-SQSTM1 were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Antibodies against HSPA1A and ACTIN
were obtained from Stressgen and Millipore, respectively.

RNA interference
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to human
BECN1 and negative control siRNA were purchased from
Invitrogen. Specific siRNA targeted to human ATG5 was
synthesized by Invitrogen using the published sequence
5-GGACGAAUUCCAACUUGUU-3 [17]. GIST430 and
GIST48 cells were transfected with siRNA of BECN1,
ATG5, or negative control using Lipofectamine 2000®
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Immunoblotting studies

Briefly, GIST430 and GIST48 cells at 90% confluence in
6-well plates were transfected with the indicated dose of
annealed RNA duplexes mixed with 2 µL of Lipofectamine
2000® for 6 h, and then replaced with serum-containing
complete medium for 72 h. The influence of siRNA on
BECN1 or ATG5 protein expression was confirmed by
immunoblotting with specific antibodies.

Cells were lysed in CelLyticTM M Cell Lysis Reagent
containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors.
The protein concentration was determined using the
Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was
performed after loading equal amounts of protein into
each lane. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) membranes for immunoblotting.
After blocking with bovine serum albumin (BSA), the
membranes were blotted by adding primary antibodies
against specific proteins, followed by the appropriate
secondary antibodies. Protein bands were detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer), developed
by autoradiography and quantified using 1Dscan EX gel
analysis software (Scanalytics). The data are expressed as
the mean ± S.E.

Cell viability assay
For this assay, 5×104 GIST430 or 4×104 GIST48
cells were seeded in each well of 24-well plates. GIST430
and GIST48 cells were exposed to various concentrations
of drugs for 4 days. The methylene blue dye assay was
used to evaluate the effects of each drug on the relative
number of viable cells [17]. Data were measured with a
SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Device) at
595 nm and normalized to the DMSO-only control group.
The IC50 was determined by plotting growth relative to
that of the untreated controls. All experimental points were
measured in duplicate wells for each plate and replicated
in at least three plates.
To assess the interaction between AUY922 and
rapamycin, the combination index (CI) was analyzed using
the method of Chou and Talalay, based on the multiple
drug effect equation [51]. Briefly, the constant ratio
combination design was chosen to assess the combination
effect of both drugs. Dose-response curves were
determined with both drugs in combination at a fixed ratio
equivalent to the ratio of their IC50 values. The CI value
indicates that the effects of the two drugs were additive
(CI≈1), synergistic (CI<1), or antagonistic (CI>1). All
experimental points were measured in duplicate wells for
each plate and were replicated in at least three plates.

Immunofluorescence staining
For immunofluorescence staining, GIST430
and GIST48 cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with Triton X-100, and blocked with 5%
BSA in PBS at 4°C overnight. Cells were incubated
with primary antibodies against KIT, MAP1LC3B, or
SQSTM1. Cells used as nonspecific staining control were
incubated with normal rabbit, goat, or mouse antibodies.
The cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated
with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody, washed
three times with PBS, and examined under a confocal
microscope (FV1000, Confocal Laser Scanning Biological
Microscope, Olympus).

Flow cytometry

Clonogenic assay

Apoptosis was determined by staining cells with
Annexin V-FITC and PI (BD Biosciences) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by flow cytometry
analysis. Briefly, GIST430 and GIST48 cells were
incubated with drugs for the indicated times and doses and
then trypsinized. Each sample containing 1×105 cells was
washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 100 µl binding
buffer. Then, 5 µl Annexin V-FITC and 5 µl PI were added
to the cells, which were then incubated for 15 min at room
temperature (RT) in the dark. An additional 400 µl binding
buffer was added to the reaction prior to analysis.

1×103 GIST430 or GIST48 cells in the logarithmic
growth phase were seeded in each well in 6-well plates.
GIST430 and GIST48 cells were incubated with the
indicated doses of drugs for 1 day and then replaced with
growth media for an additional 14 days. The cells were
stained with 50% ethanol containing 0.5% methylene blue
for 5 h. The plates were washed five times with water and
allowed to air-dry. Colonies were countered manually.
The IC50 value corresponding to 50% inhibition of cell
growth was determined after plotting growth relative to
the untreated controls. Each value represented the average
of at least three independent experiments performed in
triplicate.

GIST430 xenograft animal model and the drug
treatment
NOD/SCID mice were purchased from LASCO.
The animals were subcutaneously implanted with 2x107
GIST430 cells mixed with equal volume of Matrigel (BD

Biosciences) in 0.1 mL in one flank per mouse. Tumor
volume was estimated from caliper measurements every
two days after implantation and calculated as 1/2 x
length (mm) x width2 (mm). After tumors developed for
approximately 4 weeks and tumor volumes reached 50 to
100 mm3, mice were intraperitoneally injected with the
indicated dose of AUY922 and rapamycin dissolved in
DMSO, either alone or in combination, twice a week for
4 consecutive weeks. The control group was treated with
DMSO only. Tumor volumes were measured every two
days after drug treatment. At the end of the experiments,
animals were sacrificed and tumors were visualized and
stored at -80°C for further immunohistochemical analysis.

Immunohistochemical analysis

Conflict of interest/Disclosure

Sections of tumor tissue blocks were cut onto
adhesive-coated glass slides (Instrumedics, Hackensack)
at a thickness of 3 µm. The slides were dewaxed in xylene
and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. Then,
slides were pressure-cooked in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH
6) for 7 minutes for antigen retrieval and washed using
TBS with 0.1% Tween 80 for 5 minutes. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked by 3% H2O2 treatment.
After washing, the slides were incubated with primary
antibodies against KIT (Epitomics), MAP1LC3B, HIF1A
(Novus Biologicals), and PECAM1 (BD Biosciences)
at RT for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were detected
following the user’s manual of the ChemMate DAKO
EnVision kit (DAKO). The slides were incubated with the
secondary antibody for 30 minutes and developed with
3,3-diaminobenzidine for 5 minutes. Slides were then
counterstained with hematoxylin. Incubation without the
primary antibody was used as a negative control.

Research funding was from the National Health
Research Institutes (CA-103-PP-15) and the Ministry of
Health and Welfare (DOH102-TD-PB-111-TM-014 and
CA-103-SP-01) of Taiwan to Dr. Li-Tzong Chen, while
research compound (NVP-AUY922) was kindly provided
by Novartis. Dr. Li-Tzong Chen also received honorarium
and research grants for other studies from Novartis.
