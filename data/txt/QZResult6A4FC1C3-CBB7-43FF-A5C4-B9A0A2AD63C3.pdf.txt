ABSTRACT
To investigate the prognostic effect of microRNA single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, 658 female participants from
northeast China were enrolled in our prospective cohort study and followed up
from 2010 to 2015. C-containing genotypes of miR-149 rs2292832 were associated
with better overall survival (OS). The joint effect of miR-149 and miR-196a2 and
the joint effect of miR-149 and miR-608 were also observed in our study. To verify
the function of miR-149 rs2292832, A549 cell lines were stably transfected with
lenti-virus containing miR-149-C vector, miR-149-T vector and empty vector. Cells
containing C allele assumed a higher expression level of miR-149, a decrease in cell
growth and the sensitivity to anticancer drug when compared with cells containing
T allele. The role of miR-149 playing in cancer prognosis may function through DNA
topoisomerases 1 (TOP1) pathway, according to the results from luciferase reporter
assays. In conclusion, miR-149 C allele may be a prognostic biomarker for better
NSCLC OS.

Genetic variants presented in miRNA genes or genes
being involved in processing mechanisms may inhibit
miRNA expression [10]. Moreover, SNPs located in some
specified sites may weaken the affinity between miRNAs
and their target mRNAs [11]. In our present study, we
aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms
in pre-miRNAs on the prognosis of non-small cell lung
cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is a common malignancy worldwide,
accounting for 23.6% deaths due to cancers. In China,
the mortality of lung cancer is the highest for both men
and women [1, 2]. The overall 5-year-survival is only
16.1% for Chinese female population as reported in a
recent cohort study [3]. The poor survival rates for female
lung cancer patients call for the refinements in clinical
treatment.
Recently, microRNA has emerged as an influential
factor in lung cancer progression [4]. microRNAs are a
class of 19-25nt in length, small non-coding RNAs [5].
Aberrant expression profiles and genetic polymorphisms
of some microRNAs have been shown to be associated
with cancer survival [6–9].

rate was observed only in patients with different clinical
stages (P<0.001). While, the significant median survival
time (MST) can be observed in patients with different
histological types, clinical stages and in patients with or
without receipt of chemotherapy or surgery (P<0.05).
The association between the five SNPs and OS
was summarized in Table 2. Patients containing C allele
of miR-149 rs2292832 may have a better OS, longer
MST and lower death rate. The effect of miR-149 SNPs
on survival rate may be associated with the number of
C alleles. Patients with more C allele may have a better
prognosis. Figure 1 was the survival curves for patients
with different genoytypes of miR-149 rs2292832. No
statistically significant association was observed for the
other four SNPs.
Given the effect of patients baseline characteristics
on survival, we proceeded to conduct stratified analyses.
Results were summarized in Table 3. The protective
role of C-containing genotypes of miR-149 were widely
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

observed in patients from different strata. Figure 2 was
the survival curves for I/II/III patients with different
genotypes. The protective effect of CC genotypes in
miR-196a2 rs11614913 was observed in patients with
squamous carcinoma. CC genotype of miR-608 rs4919510
may function as a risk factor for patients receiving
chemotherapy or surgery. No significant association was
observed for miR-146a and miR-423 polymorphisms in
the stratified analyses (data not shown).
The joint effect for the miRNA SNPs was estimated
in our study. Results were summarized in Table 4. As
shown in the table, the joint effect of miR-149 SNP and
miR-196a2 SNP appeared in patients with squamous cell
carcinoma. The joint effect of miR-149 SNP and miR608 SNP appeared in patients receiving chemotherapy or
surgery.
To explore the impact of these five SNPs on
expression levels in lung cancer tissues, we conducted the
qRT-PCR and results were summarized in Supplementary

Table S2. The G-containing genotypes of miR-146a,
C-containing genotypes of miR-149 and miR-196 were
observed to be associated with increased expression
level of mature miRNA. The association between the
three SNPs and miRNA expression was described in
Supplementary Figure S1. No significant association with
miRNA expression was observed for miR-423 and miR608 SNPs.
The effect of rs2292832 on miR-149 expression was
verified in our A549 cell lines. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S2, vectors containing C allele has a higher
expression level of miR-149 than those containing T
allele. The expression level of vectors containing C allele
was 1.55 times that of the vectors containing T allele
(P<0.001).
The significant differences for cell proliferation
was observed in our study. Results were shown in Figure
3. Vectors containing C allele may lead to decreased
cell proliferation when compared to vectors containing
T allele (P=0.038) and empty vectors (P<0.001). These

results were accordant with the results in cell cycle
analyses. As shown in Figure 4, cell number of G1 phase
in vectors containing C allele was higher than that in
vectors containing T allele (P=0.004) and empty vectors
(P=0.023). Cell number of S phase in vectors containing
C allele was lower than that in vectors containing T allele
(P=0.001) and empty vectors (P=0.007). These results
implied that cells containing C allele may obtain inhibition
at G1/S transition.
DNA topoisomerases IB (TOP1) was screened out
as potential target mRNA of miR-149 by bioinformatics
methods. Luciferase reporter assay was constructed
to investigate the influence of miR-149 in activities of
target gene. Results were shown in Figure 5. The relative
luciferase activities for cells transfected with TOP13’UTR and miR-149 mimics were lower than the other
three groups (P<0.001). We proceeded to perform the qRTPCR and western blotting to investigate the influence of
miR-149 in trascription and translation of TOP1 gene. No
significant effect on TOP1 mRNA levels was observed in

qRT-PCR (P=0.079, Supplementary Figure S3). While,
the significant effect on TOP1 protein expression was
observed in western blotting (P<0.001, Figure 6). These
results implied that miR-149 SNP may influence the
translation of TOP1 mRNA instead of the transcription of
TOP1 gene.
miR-149 SNP conferred significant effect
on survival rate for cells being treated with cisDichlorodiamineplatinum(II) (DDP) in our study. Results
were shown in Figure 7. Being treated with concentrations
of Rank 1, 5 and 6, cells containing C allele were more
sensitive to DDP than those containing T allele. Being
treated with concentrations of Rank 2 and 7, cells
containing C allele were less sensitive to DDP than those
containing T allele.

that C allele can increase the miR-149 expression levels,
and therefore causing the decrease in TOP1 expression
levels and cell growth. These results above explain the
reasons that patients with C allele of miR-149 rs2292832
have better prognosis. We also observed the drug
sensitivity for cells with C allele of miR-149 rs2292832
for certain DDP concentrations. These results support
our observations that C allele is associated with better
prognosis for patients who receiving chemotherapy.
The expression of miR-149 exhibited differently
in cancer survival as previously reported [12–15]. Our
results for miR-149 are consistent with Katada, Luo
and Ke’s studies [12–14]. Our study may help to have
a deeper congnization of the role of miR-149 playing
in cancer progression. Except for EMT and AKT1
signaling, miR-149 also involves in DNA topoisomerases
functioning pathway to inhibit cancer cell growth. DNA
topoisomerases are grouped as type I and type II. TOP1
(TOPIB) enzyme mainly involves in DNA relaxing
to remove negative supercoils [16]. The inhibition of

DISCUSSION
The main results of our study is the protective effect
of miR-149 SNPs on OS. Functional study results imply

TOP1 expression may result in the increase in negative
supercoils and therefore the decrease in cell growth. In our
study, we observed the increase in miR-149 expression,
the decrease in TOP1 protein levels and cell growth.
The prognostic role of miR-149 rs2292832 has
been demonstrated previously in various types of cancer
[17–24]. For NSCLC, results in our study are consistent
with Hong’s study [17]. For the previous study [17], the
participants are early-stage, surgically resected NSCLC
in Korea. While the subjects included in our study are
584 Chinese females with late-stage NSCLC. Another
distinction from Hong’s study is the association study for
SNPs in miR-423 and miR-608 with NSCLC OS. Results
in the present study support our previous study [25] and
strengthen the role of miR-149 rs2292832 playing in
NSCLC OS.
We also observed the significant association for
miR-196a2 and miR-608 with NSCLC OS. In previous
study, we noticed that the CC genotype of miR-196a2
rs11614913 is a risk factor for II/IIIA NSCLC patients
[17]. While, we cannot observe the same effect in our
study. In our study, we only observed the protective role of

C-containing genotypes in squamous cell carcinoma. miR608 CC genotype showed the risk effect on OS for patients
receiving chemotherapy. This may indicate that miR608 CC genotype may enhance the multi-drug resistant
(MDR). While, the relatively small sample size for
stratified analyses may shad the significance of the results.
Larger studies are warranted to verify our results. The
effect of miR-146a, miR-423 and their SNPs on cancer
progression has been extensively studied previously [26–
32]. Nevertheless, the effect of the two genetic variants on
NSCLC OS was not observed in our study.
Some defects exist in our study. Firstly, the sample
size is not large in the cohort study. And the number is
even smaller for stratified analyses. Secondly, only A549
cell lines were used in functional study. Thirdly, the
function for miR-149 and its SNP was verified in vitro,
without being verified in vivo.
In spite of the defects above, some advantages
exist in our present study. One strength is that this is a
multi-center study, enhancing the reliability of the results.
Another one is the use of a systematic search for the
genome-wide SNPs in miRNAs. The third one is that the

subjects recruited are all females. Previous studies pay
more attention to men and smokers. Although women
were included in their studies, the number was relatively
small. Our present study aimed to help to provide evidence
for detection of prognostic biomarkers for females. The
fourth one is the first time to obtain the role of miR-608
SNP in NSCLC OS, to the best of our knowledge. The last
but not the least, this is the first report that TOP1 is the
target mRNA of miR-149, to the best of our knowledge.
In conclusion, we provided evidence that miR149, miR-196a2 and miR-608 polymorphisms may be
associated with NSCLC overall survival in Chinese
females. Our results support the prognostic role of
miRNAs in cancer survival and the combination of miR149 with miR-196a2 may act as a biomarker for squamous
cell lung cancer prognosis. The certain combined
genotypes of miR-149 and miR-608 SNPs can help to
enhance the sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs and therefore
predict a better OS. Our results are to be confirmed by
larger prospective studies.

S3). We screened out 604 SNP sites with a MAF no less
than 5% in Chinese Han population according to the data
available in dbSNP. For these SNPs, we performed an
extensive research in HapMap and Patrocles. 13 SNPs
that located in pre-miRNA or mature miRNA with a
MAF>0.05 were screened out. Given the consideration of
false-positive rate by using a single bioinformatics tool,
we return to miRBase and dbSNP to verify the sequences
of the 13 SNPs. SNPs without being verified were
excluded. We got 9 sites after above steps. Furthermore,
the Gibbs binding free energy (ΔG,Kcal/mol) for each
pair of common and variant alleles was computed using
viennaRNA software [34]. The differences of the free
energies between the two alleles were calculated as ΔΔG.
We ranked the values of ΔΔG, and chose the 2 Kcal/
mol as cut-off. 3 SNPs had a ΔΔG≥2 Kcal/mol. Among
the SNPs with a ΔΔG<2 Kcal/mol, we found two SNPs
located in two pivotal sites for miRNA maturation [10,
35]. rs6505162 located within 3nt of 3’ pre-miRNA and
rs4919510 located in dsRNA of pre-miRNA. Finally, we
selected 5 SNPs (hsa-miR-196a2 rs11614913, hsa-miR146a rs2910164, hsa-miR-149 rs2292832, hsa-miR-423
rs6505162 and hsa-miR-608 rs4919510) (Supplementary
Table S4). The work flow of SNP selection was exhibited
in Supplementary Figure S4.
Phenol-chloroform method was utilized to extract
genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples. The
TaqMan allelic discrimination method was used to
genotype the five selected SNPs according to the protocol.
The samples were read and analyzed from the ABI 7500
Fast Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems,
Lifetechnologies, USA). The average genotype call rate
for all SNPs were 99.2%. About 10% of the samples were
randomly selected for confirmation by repeat genotyping,
and the results were 100% concordant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
This study was conducted in accordance with the
amended Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review
board of China Medical University approved the protocol
and written informed consent was obtained from all
patients. All subjects were females and they were from
unrelated ethnic Han Chinese. Estimates of the exposure
to environmental factors were reported in previous study
[33]. Individual with a total of 100 cigarettes in her lifetime
was defined as a smoker, otherwise she was considered
as a non-smoker [33]. The patients were recruited during
March 2010 to March 2013 at the Liaoning Cancer
Hospital & Institute, Shenyang North Hospital and the
fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University.
All patients were histologically confirmed when they
were enrolled in the cohort. All subjects were interviewed
and venous blood sample was obtained from each subject.
Detailed background and clinical information including
age, sex, tobacco exposure, TNM stage, clinical stage,
histological type, receipt of chemotherapy and receipt of
surgery has been collected.
Subjects received telephone follow-up every three
months after being diagnosed with cancer. Data from
Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) registry system were collected for death cause.
Inpatient and outpatient medical records and Death
Registry System of Shenyang Public Security Bureau
were used to confirm the date of death. The patients were
followed up to death or April 2015. Totally, we collected
complete information of 584 patients. Another 74 patients
were lost to follow up. In our study, the outcome event
was defined as death from lung cancer. If not, the patients

expression.

Cell lines and culture
A549 cell lines were purchased from Shanghai
Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). They were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA)
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), 100 U/ml
penicillin sodium and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate.
Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C with an air atmosphere
containing 5% carbon dioxide. In our experiment, cells
were used and passaged when they reach the logarithmic
phase of growth.

Identification of target mRNA of miR-149
Starbase v2.0 was utilized to predict the potential
target mRNAs of miR-149. Starbase includes the results
from five informatics databases, TargetScan, PicTar,
RNA22, PITA and miRanda/mirSVR (data shown in
Supplementary Table S6). The potential mRNAs with at
least two databases that indicating the target site were
screened out. We proceeded to investigate the mature
mRNA expression levels between lung cancer and normal
tissues. The mRNAs with a fold change no less than 1.3
were screened out (Supplementary Table S7). Finally, we
performed GO and KEGG analyses in String database for
the mRNA of interest (Supplementary Table S8).

Plasmid construction, lenti-virus production and
stable transfection
The common miR-149 expression construct (miR149-T) and the variant miR-149 expression construct
(miR-149-C) were generated using GV369 vector
(GeneChem, China). The sequence of both constructs
were confirmed by direct sequencing. An empty GV369
vector was used as negative control. All the vectors were
packaged with lentivirus and stable transfection were
performed according to the manufacture’s precedure.
The transfection efficiency was assessed by counting
green fluorescent protein-positive cells four days after the
transfection. 2ug/ml puromycin (Amresco, USA) were
used to screen out the A549 cells transfected with miR149-T, miR-149-C and empty vectors.

RNA isolation from cell lines and qRT-PCR for
detection of miR-149 and TOP1 mRNA
Total RNAs were obtained with RNAiso Plus
(KeyGEN BioTECH, China) following the manufacture’s
procedure. To detect the TOP1 mRNA expression
levels, a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser
(Takara, Japan) was used for cDNA synthesis. SYBR
Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan) was used for quantitative
real time PCR and GAPDH was used as an internal
control. The primers (Dingguo, China) for PCR were:
TOP1-F: ACAGATGAGCAAGGAAGAG, TOP1-R:
TGGAGGAGGAGAAGGAAC, Human GAPDHF258bp: AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG, Human
GAPDH-R258bp:AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC. To
detect the miR-149 expression levels, TaqMan MicroRNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems,
USA) were used for cDNA synthesis and and TaqMan
MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems, USA) were used
for quantitative PCR. U6 was used as an internal control.
The PCR was repeated three times for every sample. The
relative expression was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method.

Cell proliferation and cell cycle
To investigate the cell proliferation, cells were
harvested 24h, 48h and 72h after transfection. The survival
rate were determined by using the Cell Counting Kit 8
(KeyGEN BioTECH, China). The absorbance value of
each well was obtained at 450nm in the Bio-Rad M680
spectrophotometer (USA). Each time point and each
experiment were repeated three times.
To investigate the cell cycle, cells were harvested
48h after transfection and treated by using the Cell Cycle
Detection Kit (KeyGEN BioTECH, China). DNA content
was detected by flow cytometry on a FACS Calibur system
(BD, USA). Results were exhibited as the percentage of
cells in G1, S and G2 phases.

Western blotting
Total proteins were isolated from nucleus by
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit
(Beyotime, China) and quantified using BCA method.
Protein sample was analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% seperation gel
and 5% spacer gel). The antibodies were anti-TOP1,
anti-H3 and anti-rabbit IgG (ProteinTech, China). The
dilution ratio for anti-TOP1 was 1:2000. The dilution

Drug sensitivity assay
To investigate the drug sensitivity, cells
were harvested 24h after being treated with cisDichlorodiamineplatinum(II) (DDP) (Sigma, USA).
According to the drug concentrations, cells were grouped
as eight Ranks. For Rank 1, the drug concentration was
0.977ug/ml. For Rank 2, the drug concentration was

Luciferase reporter assay
TOP1 3’UTR fragment was inserted at the XbaI
site, downstream of the luciferase gene in GV272 vector
(GenChem, China) (Supplementary Figure S5). A vector
containing the mutant of TOP1 3’UTR fragment was
constructed as negative control. The vectors expressing
ranilla luciferase were constructed as inner control. All
of the sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing.
Plasmids were isolated from E.coli by using TaKaRa
MiniBEST Plasmid Purification Kit (Takara, Japan). The
miR-149 mimics and the control miRNAs duplex (named
as NC mimics) were purchased from GenePharma (China).
The sequences were listed in Supplementary Table S9.
Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 Kit
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s procedure.
Fourty-eight hours after the transfection, luciferase
activities were measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) in Synergy H1 systems (Bio Tek,
USA). The relative luciferase activity was calculated as
the ratio of firefly fluciferase value and ranilla luciferase
value. The experiment was repeated three times.

Goodness-of-fit chi-square test was used to compare
the death rates between groups with different baseline
characteristics. The OS was calculated from the date at
diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or death. Differences
of MST between groups were estimated by log-rank test.
Survival curve was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method
and analyzed by the means of log-rank test. Univariate and
multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models
were used to estimate the crude and adjusted hazards
ratio (HRs) and their confidence interval (CIs). Student
t-test and ANOVA were used to compare the differences
for continuous variables. Statistically significant P-value
is less than 0.05. All of the statistical analyses were
performed in SPSS 17.0 and all P-values were two-sided.
