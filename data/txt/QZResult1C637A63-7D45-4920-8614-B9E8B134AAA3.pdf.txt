Roles of Sildenafil in Enhancing Drug Sensitivity in Cancer

Abstract
The phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR) has decreased the hope for successful cancer chemotherapy.
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily is the largest transmembrane family. The overexpression of ABC transporters is a major determinant of MDR in cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Unfortunately, until recently, most of the strategies used to surmount ABC-transporter–mediated MDR have had
limited success. An ideal modulator of MDR would be one that has a low liability to induce toxicity and alter the
pharmacokinetic profile of antineoplastic drugs. Sildenafil, an inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase
type 5, was found to significantly reverse ABC-transporter–mediated MDR. Our results indicate that sildenafil
has differential inhibitory effects on ABC transporters: It significantly decreases the efflux activity of ABCB1 and
ABCG2, but has no significant effects on ABCC1. Emerging evidence indicates that sildenafil and other
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors may enhance the sensitivity of certain types of cancer to standard
chemotherapeutic drugs. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3735–8. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells is the primary
cause of cancer chemotherapy failure. One of the major
determinants of the MDR phenotype is the overexpression
of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which include
ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein/MDR1), ABCCs [multidrug resistance–
associated proteins (MRP)], and ABCG2 (BCRP/MXR/ABCP)
(1). Membrane proteins in this superfamily share the ability to
actively transport a wide variety of substrates, ranging from
ions, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, and drugs to larger
molecules, across the cellular membrane, although each transporter has its own substrate specificity (1). When these transporters are overexpressed in cancer cells, they pump out or
extrude structurally and mechanistically different chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby lowering intracellular drug concentration and leading to an attenuated chemotherapeutic effect (2).
An increasing amount of evidence is showing that in addition
to contributing to drug resistance, ABC transporters also play
an important role in tumorigenesis (3). The expression of
specific ABC transporters is associated with tumor-initiating

cells or cancer stem cells in several types of cancer, and
their clinical relevance is now being widely studied (3).
Ideally, inhibition of these transporters would lead to resensitization of MDR cancer cells or cancer stem cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and allow for a more efficacious treatment
of cancer patients. For >30 years, investigators have been
making a significant effort to develop specific inhibitors/
modulators that can reverse MDR in cancer cells. Typically,
these compounds are classified as first-, second-, or thirdgeneration inhibitors/modulators. The first-generation inhibitors/modulators are drugs that are used clinically and have
well-established pharmacologic profiles, such as verapamil (4)
and cyclosporine A (5). However, both verapamil and cyclosporine A were shown to be ineffective in clinical trials as a
result of serious adverse effects produced by the dose required
to significantly reverse MDR (6, 7). Subsequently, secondgeneration inhibitors/modulators, derivatives of the firstgeneration inhibitors/modulators with more potent inhibitory
activity (e.g., SDZ PSC833 and valspodar), were developed and
tested (8). Unfortunately, data from clinical trials indicated that
SDZ PSC833 inhibited the metabolism and elimination of
certain clinically used anticancer drugs, thereby increasing
their plasma levels and producing toxicity (9). Investigators
then derived third-generation inhibitors/modulators from the
second-generation lead compounds on the basis of their pharmacophores by chemical modification using structure-activity
relationships. Subsequent studies indicated that these compounds, including LY335979 (zosuquidar; ref. 10), GF120918
(elacridar; ref. 11), and MS-209 (dofequidar; ref. 12), had a high
affinity (nanomolar) for ABC transporters. Although they
showed promising activity in preclinical studies and in early
clinical trials as potent and nontoxic inhibitors/modulators,
most of these compounds were found to lack significant
efficacy in late-phase clinical trials (13). In light of the aforementioned results, it is clear that there is still a need to develop
and test efficacious and nontoxic inhibitors/modulators.

Figure 1. Proposed mechanisms for sildenafil-induced augmentation of the efficacy of antineoplastic drugs, shown in a schematic model. Sildenafil
may enhance the therapeutic effect of antineoplastic drugs by (1) blocking the substrate efflux function of MDR transporters such as ABCC4/MRP4 (16),
ABCC5/MRP5 (15), ABCB1/P-gp, and ABCG2/BCRP (17); and/or (2) increasing cGMP levels by inhibiting PDE5, ABCC4-, and ABCC5-mediated efflux of
cGMP. In addition, it has been proposed that in tumor cells, the elevation of cGMP levels by inhibition of PDE5 may activate PKG, leading to growth
suppression or apoptosis (26, 27).

Sildenafil, an inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), is clinically
used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial
hypertension (World Health Organization Class I). Sildenafil
binds to PDE5 and prevents the biotransformation of second
messenger 30 ,50 -cGMP to 50 -GMP, thus increasing intracellular
cGMP levels. It has been reported that high cGMP levels are
associated with increased blood flow as a result of vascular
smooth muscle vasodilation (14). Previously, cyclic nucleotide
second messengers such as cGMP and cAMP were shown to
be substrates with low micromolar affinity for ABCC4/MRP4

and ABCC5/MRP5. Furthermore, sildenafil significantly
inhibits the efflux activity of ABCC4 and ABCC5 (15, 16).
Our recent studies showed that sildenafil also inhibits the
activity of ABC transporters such as ABCB1 and ABCG2, and
reverses MDR in cancer cells mediated by these transporters
(ref. 17; Fig. 1).

Key Findings
Recently, we examined the in vitro effect of sildenafil on
ABCB1-, ABCC1-, and ABCG2-mediated MDR in cancer cells.

Sildenafil and Cancer

Our data indicate that sildenafil has differential effects on
these three transporters. Cytotoxicity assays showed that
sildenafil significantly sensitized ABCB1-overexpressing cells
to the ABCB1 substrates colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel. In addition, sildenafil sensitized wild-type or mutant
ABCG2-overexpressing cells to the ABCG2 substrates flavopiridol, mitoxantrone, and SN-38. However, sildenafil did not
significantly sensitize ABCC1-overexpressing cells to its substrate, vincristine. In addition, sildenafil did not have any
significant effect on the sensitivity of any of the parental cell
lines to the aforementioned antineoplastic drugs. Consistent
with the cytotoxicity data, the results of the drug accumulation study showed that sildenafil significantly enhanced the
intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel in the ABCB1-overexpressing cells, as well as mitoxantrone and BODIPY-prazosin in either wild-type or mutant ABCG2-overexpressing cells.
In addition, the results of membrane-vesicle transport experiments showed that sildenafil directly inhibited the ABCG2mediated transport of E217bG and methotrexate. Sildenafil
significantly stimulated ABCB1 and ABCG2 ATPase activity,
whereas it inhibited photolabeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with
[3H]IAAP. We also predicted the binding conformation of
sildenafil within the large cavity of the transmembrane region
of ABCB1 on the basis of the homology model (17).
We also examined the effect of another PDE5 inhibitor,
vardenafil, a structural analogue of sildenafil, on ABC-transporter–mediated MDR in cancer cells. The results showed that
vardenafil significantly sensitized ABCB1-overexpressing cells to
the ABCB1 substrates vinblastine and paclitaxel, increased the
intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel in the ABCB1-overexpressing cells, significantly stimulated the ATPase activity of
ABCB1, and inhibited photolabeling of ABCB1 with IAAP. In
contrast, vardenafil had no significant effect on any of the
parental cells or on reversing ABCC1- and ABCG2-mediated
MDR (18).

Implications
Previous studies reported that increased PDE5 expression
occurs in multiple human carcinomas, including urinary bladder cancers (19), metastatic breast cancers (20), and non–small
cell lung cancers (21). These findings suggest that PDE5 may
play a role in tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibition of PDE5
activity may have antineoplastic effects. Several groups have
evaluated the effect of sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors on
cancer treatment. In one study (22), sildenafil and vardenafil
suppressed tumor cell growth and induced caspase-dependent
apoptosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro.
In a rat brain tumor model, the PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil and
vardenafil increased the transport of doxorubicin across the
blood–brain tumor barrier and enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy (23). It was also shown that sildenafil reverses
tumor-induced immunosuppression and enhances the antitumor response by reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cell
function, leading to delay in tumor growth (24). Moreover,
sildenafil was reported to enhance the sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to doxorubicin without exacerbating its toxicity to
either bone marrow cells or macrophages (25). Sildenafil also

www.aacrjournals.org

increased the chemotherapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin in
prostate cancer in vivo and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction
(26). Another PDE5 inhibitor, sulindac sulfide, selectively inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of human breast tumor cells
by elevating cGMP and activating protein kinase G (PKG;
ref. 27). On the basis of these studies and our data, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that sildenafil may enhance the
sensitivity of anticancer drugs and potentially improve the
chemotherapeutic outcome in cancer patients due to its
inhibitory effect on PDE5, ABCB1, and ABCG2. Future studies
examining the combined use of sildenafil with anticancer drugs
need to consider several issues. First, it is important to examine
the expression levels of PDE5, ABCB1, and ABCG2 in cancer
tissues. In addition to overexpression of ABC transporters,
cancer cells feature other drug-resistance determinants,
including changes in metabolizing and detoxifying systems,
such as DNA repair and the cytochrome P450 oxidases, and
drug-induced alterations in apoptosis (1). Hence, the expression levels of sildenafil target proteins such as PDE5, ABCB1,
and ABCG2 would significantly determine the efficiency of
sildenafil. Second, a determination of the concentrations that
would be effective in vivo would definitely improve the outcome of the combined use of sildenafil with anticancer drugs.
The maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of a
single oral dose of 25 to 200 mg of sildenafil in healthy male
subjects is 127 to 1,150 ng/mL (0.2–2 mmol/L; ref. 28), which is
slightly lower than the concentration we observed for MDR
reversal (17). Therefore, concentrations of sildenafil exceeding
those required for PDE5 inhibition seem to be required to
enhance the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. Third, the
pharmacokinetic profiles of sildenafil and anticancer drugs
may affect each other, potentially resulting in an increased
therapeutic response as well as adverse effects. This is possible
because ABCB1 and ABCG2 are highly expressed in several
normal tissues (1) where the concentration and distribution of
sildenafil and anticancer drugs may be altered if the drugs are
used in combination. Finally, sildenafil is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme CYP3A4 (29),
and the substrates of CYP3A4 considerably overlap those of
ABCB1 (29). Consequently, the metabolism and elimination of
both sildenafil and anticancer drugs, some of which are substrates of both CYP3A4 and ABCB1 (30), may be affected when
these drugs are used in combination.

Future Directions
Our studies show for the first time that 2 imidazotriazinone
compounds, sildenafil and vardenifil (both of which are PDE5/
PDE6 inhibitors), can reverse ABCB1- or ABCG2-mediated
MDR in cancer cells by directly blocking their drug efflux
function. In addition, our results suggest that imidazotriazinone compounds may be a novel class of ABC transporters
inhibitors. The effects of additional imidazotriazinone compounds on ABC transporter function will be investigated in
the future. Elucidating the structure-activity relationship
involved in the inhibition of cGMP hydrolase and ABC transporters by sildenafil may allow for the synthesis of sildenafil
analogues that are more efficacious for reversing MDR

without affecting the cGMP hydrolase activity of PDE5.
Clearly, further in vivo studies will be required to determine
whether sildenafil can be used as a modulator of ABCB1 and
ABCG2 to reverse MDR in cancer cells. Currently, it is not
known whether sildenafil can reverse MDR in human cancers
mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2. Furthermore, it may be
useful to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer
patients who are being treated with sildenafil for other clinical
indications.
