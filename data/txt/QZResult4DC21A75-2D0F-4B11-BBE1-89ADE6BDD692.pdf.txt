ABSTRACT
Clinical responses to bendamustine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are
highly heterogeneous and no specific markers to predict sensitivity to this drug have
been reported. In order to identify biomarkers of response, we analyzed the in vitro
activity of bendamustine and the gene expression profile in primary CLL cells. We
observed that mRNA expression of CD69 (CD69) and ITGAM (CD11b) constitute the
most powerful predictor of response to bendamustine. When we interrogated the
predictive value of the corresponding cell surface proteins, the expression of the
activation marker CD69 was the most reliable predictor of sensitivity to bendamustine.
Importantly, a multivariate analysis revealed that the predictive value of CD69
expression was independent from other clinico-biological CLL features. We also
showed that when CLL cells were co-cultured with distinct subtypes of stromal cells,
an upregulation of CD69 was accompanied by a reduced sensitivity to bendamustine.
In agreement with this, tumor cells derived from lymphoid tumor niches harbored
higher CD69 expression and were less sensitive to bendamustine than their peripheral
blood counterparts. Furthermore, pretreatment of CD69 high CLL cases with the B-cell
receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib decreased CD69 levels and
enhanced bendamustine cytotoxic effect. Collectively, our findings indicate that CD69
could be a predictor of bendamustine response in CLL patients and the combination
of clinically-tested BCR signaling inhibitors with bendamustine may represent a
promising strategy for bendamustine low responsive CLL cases.

features, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable
region (IGHV) mutational status, cytogenetic abnormalities
and the expression of ZAP-70, CD38 or CD49d, have been
related to patient outcome [1]. In recent years, in addition
to the known alterations in DNA-repair genes (TP53 and
ATM), next generation sequencing has identified new
somatic mutations (NOTCH1, SF3B1, BIRC3, POT1,
MYD88) with predicted functional relevance in CLL [3-6].
Despite their relative low frequency, these new mutations
could in part explain CLL heterogeneity and help in
identifying clinically relevant groups of patients [4, 5, 7]
and new targeted therapies in this entity [8, 9].
The standard of care for CLL is a cytotoxic therapy
that includes fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide with the
monoclonal antibody rituximab (FCR) [10]. Bendamustine
is a well-tolerated and less toxic agent that has emerged
as a feasible therapy for elderly and non-fit CLL patients
[11]. Several trials have shown its clinical efficacy in
previously untreated and refractory CLL patients being the
combination of bendamustine with rituximab one of the
first-line treatments for elderly patients with CLL lacking
17p deletion [12-15]. Nowadays, in vitro results and
ongoing clinical trials have explored the combination of
bendamustine with new generation monoclonal antibodies
[16, 17] and novel targeted agents[18-22].
Bendamustine is a bifunctional alkylating agent that
contains a nitrogen mustard group and a benzimidazole
nucleous, combining the properties of an alkylator and a
purine analogue. These structural characteristics confer
the compound a unique mechanism of action, with only
partial cross-resistance to other alkylating agents and
antimetabolites [23]. Differences have been observed
in regard to its effects on DNA repair and cell cycle
progression. Moreover, bendamustine engages cell death
through both apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways,
thereby retaining activity even in cells with dysfunctional
apoptotic machinery [24]. Recently, it has been reported
that some membrane transporters might also contribute to
the cytotoxic effect of bendamustine [25, 26].
Herein, a high-throughput gene expression analysis
allows us to identify putative biomarkers that could predict
clinical response of CLL patients to bendamustine. In
addition, we propose rational drug combinations to
overcome resistance to bendamustine.

with Annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI). As expected,
the apoptosis induced by bendamustine was highly
heterogeneous, ranging from 4.9 to 79.2% (Supplemental
Table S1). In agreement with clinical data of CLL patients
treated with bendamustine, the only CLL case carrying a
17p deletion (CLL 32) was resistant to bendamustine.
In order to find potential markers of response to
bendamustine, we carried out a gene expression profiling
of these 38 CLL cases and analyzed the differential
expressed genes between the 10 most sensitive cases, all
of them with a cytotoxicity higher than 42%, and the 10
most resistant cases, with response to bendamustine of
less than 18%. To identify the differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) between sensitive and resistant samples,
we applied a supervised analysis using a Rank Products
through the Multiexperiment Viewer Platform (TM4MeV) which is based on a two-class unpaired analysis,
using a false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.01. Next,
we discarded those genes with a fold-change below
1.5. This supervised analysis identified 414 DEGs out
of 19975, being 238 significantly down-regulated and
176 up-regulated in the bendamustine resistant group
(Supplemental Table S2).
To gain insights into the biologic meaning of the
differential expression profile between bendamustinesensitive and -resistant CLL cases, we conducted a
functional enrichment analysis using the Ingenuity
Pathway analysis (IPA) application using a specific filter
for human B lymphocytes and lymphoma/leukemia cells.
As shown in Figure 1A, the top biological processes
enriched with the DEGs were cellular movement (71
genes), cell-to-cell signaling and interaction (57 genes),
cellular development (93 genes), cellular growth and
proliferation (101 genes) and cell death and survival
(100 genes). The complete list of genes is shown in
Supplemental Table S3.
We performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) using the C2 (curated gene sets) collection from
the Molecular Signature Database v2.5, with an increasing
profile analysis, 1000 permutations of gene sets and a
weighted metric. Thus, we identified two gene signatures
related to CLL features whose gene expression correlated
with response to bendamustine (gene sets with an FDR
below 0.05 were considered). Bendamustine-resistant
samples were enriched in genes previously found to be
up-regulated in CD38+ cells [27] whereas bendamustinesensitive cases displayed up-regulation of genes downregulated in ZAP-70+ CD38+ CLL cases (Figure 1B) [28].

genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR using the Fluidigm
platform in a cohort of 77 CLL cases. Thirteen genes
from the selected list displayed an inverse correlation
with response to bendamustine (Supplemental Table 4).
CD69 and DUSP1 were the genes with the best significant
correlation with bendamustine response (P < 0.001), and
a significant correlation of P < 0.01 was observed for the
expression of ITGAM, BCL2A1 and FOS. All validated
genes had a fold-change > 2 between the resistant and
sensitive groups defined as above, with a similar trend as
observed in the microarray analysis (Figure 1C).

we quantified CD69 and CD11b protein levels by flow
cytometry in primary cells from 35 of the CLL cases
studied by qRT-PCR. Then, a second analysis to check the
predictive value of CD69 and CD11b protein levels was
performed. CD69 levels (P = 0.004) showed a correlation
with sensitivity to the drug whereas no correlation was
observed with CD11b protein expression (Figure 2). These
results prompted us to focus on the single expression of
CD69 for further study. Relative CD69 mRNA expression
levels using a Universal Human Reference RNA as a
calibrator and expression of CD69 by flow cytometry are
showed in Supplemental Table 1.

response in CLL

CD69 as an independent marker of response to
bendamustine in CLL

With the aim to obtain a predictive gene signature
of response to bendamustine, we used the gene expression
data validated by qRT-PCR to estimate the Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) metric of different combination
of genes as described in Materials and Methods. In order
to obtain the combination of validated genes that best
predicts the response to bendamustine, a linear regression
model was fitted for each combination of one to six genes.
The best cytotoxicity predictor was a signature composed
of two genes, the activation marker CD69 and the integrin
ITGAM, which had the lowest RMSE (14.976) (Table
2A). The most powerful one-variable predictor was
ITGAM (RMSE = 15.451), followed by CD69 (RMSE =
15.849) (Table 2B). CD69 and ITGAM codify for CD69
and CD11b molecules respectively, both expressed
mainly on the cell surface. To further validate our results,

To confirm the potential value of CD69 as a new
biomarker of bendamustine response in CLL, we analyzed
whether its predictive significance was independent from
the main clinical and biological characteristics of CLL
cases included in the study (n = 77). Through a Mann
Whitney U Test we observed that, besides high CD69
mRNA expression (P = 0.0004), prior treatment history
(P = 0.0189) was also associated with low response
to bendamustine. However, a multivariate analysis
including Rai/Binet stage, previous treatment, presence
of cytogenetic alterations (11qdel, 17pdel, 13qdel and
trisomy 12), positivity for the prognostic factors CD49d,
CD38, ZAP-70, IGHV mutational status and presence
of recurrent mutations (ATM, TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1,
MYD88 and BIRC3), revealed that CD69 mRNA level

was the only variable with independent predictive value of

the predictive value of CD69 expression as an independent
marker of bendamustine in vitro response in CLL.

(HS-5: P = 0.03; HK: P = 0.03; Figure 4A). Importantly,
we showed that CD69 protein levels were increased when
CLL cells were co-cultured both with HS-5 and HK cells
(31.4% and 38.7% of increase, respectively; Figure 3A)
in comparison to monocultured cells. We also compared
CD69 surface levels and bendamustine response of tumor
lymphocytes derived from the three typical anatomic CLL
compartments: peripheral blood (PB), BM and LN. For
this purpose, we treated 6 paired PB- and BM-derived
CLL cells and 6 paired PB- and LN-derived samples with
bendamustine 25 µM for 24 hours. As shown in Figure 3B,
BM-resident CLL cells, although not significantly, were
less sensitive than their respective PB counterparts (P =
0.06) whereas this trend was significant in LN-resident
cells (P = 0.03). Accordingly, we found a higher CD69
expression in tissue-resident CLL cells compared to PB
samples (mean increase of 40% in BM and 182% in LN)
(Figure 3B). All these results suggest that the activation
marker CD69 could exert a role in the resistance to
bendamustine mediated by the microenvironment.

CLL microenvironment induces CD69 expression
and reduces sensitivity to bendamustine
Microenvironment interactions in lymphoid
tissues are reported to protect tumoral CLL cells against
the action of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs
[29, 30]. In particular, CD69 has been shown to be upregulated on CLL cells in the tissue microenvironment,
both in bone marrow (BM) and lymph node (LN) [31].
With the hypothesis that CD69 could be involved in the
development of the resistance to bendamustine mediated
by the microenvironment, we co-cultured primary CLL
cells with the human bone marrow-derived stroma
cell line HS-5 and the human follicular dendritic celllike cell line HK. As previously reported [20, 22, 32],
the presence of microenvironment-mimicking cells
significantly reduced bendamustine-induced apoptosis

cytotoxicity), ibrutinib induced 18.15±4.7% cytotoxicity
whereas the combination of both drugs had a more marked
antitumor effect (36.9±5.2%) (Figure 4A). Similarly,
idelalisib (16.8±5.1%) also potentiated bendamustine
activity (36.1±4.9%) (Figure 4B). These results indicate
that BCR inhibitors may be useful to sensitize CD69high
CLL cases to bendamustine.

The BCR pathway inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib
are showing good clinical activity in CLL, in part by
reducing the degree of cellular activation [33, 34].
Particularly, it has been reported that ibrutinib is able
to down-modulate CD69 surface levels in the clinical
setting [34]. Thus, we hypothesized that BCR inhibitors
could have a role in sensitizing CD69high samples to
bendamustine. To prove this, we preincubated CLL cells
expressing high levels of CD69 ( > 30%) with ibrutinib
1 µM or idelalisib 0.5 µM for 24 hours before adding
bendamustine for 24 additional hours. Both ibrutinib and
idelalisib decreased CD69 surface protein expression at
24 hours (data not shown) and more markedly at 48 hours
(Figure 4). Importantly, the modulation of this activation
marker was accompanied by a collaborative antitumor
effect between both drugs in terms of cytotoxicity. In
this set of bendamustine resistant CLL cases (14.4±2.5%

DISCUSSION
Patients with CLL are generally managed with a
‘watch and wait’ strategy until an indication for treatment
emerges [10, 35]. The initial standard therapy for
patients without del(17)(p13.1) is chemoimmunotherapy
(fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, bendamustine,
or chlorambucil) and anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab,
ofatumumab, or obinutuzumab) that varies based
on regimen and patient status [11]. Bendamustine
as monotherapy or in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents is currently indicated for
the treatment of elderly and less fit CLL patients

lacking del(17)(p13.1) [12, 15]. The primary action of
bendamustine is the activation of a DNA damage stress
response and the inhibition of mitotic checkpoints, leading
to cell death via mitochondrial apoptosis or mitotic
catastrophe induction [36-38].
The response of CLL cells to bendamustine shows a
marked variability and the molecular mechanisms related
to bendamustine resistance remain largely undefined.
Although it has been observed a lower response to
bendamustine in cases carrying 17p/p53 alterations,
this genetic abnormality does not fully account for
heterogeneity in responsiveness to treatment. Herein,
we have performed a gene expression high-throughput
analysis with the aim of identifying putative biomarkers
that could predict the clinical response of CLL to
bendamustine. Our results showed that the DEGs between
the bendamustine-sensitive and -resistant cases belong
to biological processes related to cell death and survival,
cellular growth and proliferation. GSEA analysis revealed
that genes overexpressed in CLL signatures associated
with poor prognostic factors [27, 28] were similarly
expressed in bendamustine-resistant cases. Among
the DEGs, we found that the mRNA expression of the
activation marker CD69 and the integrin ITGAM were the
most reliable predictors of resistance to bendamustine in
CLL cells. However, at protein level only CD69 expression
correlated with bendamustine-induced cytotoxicity.
Moreover, a multivariate analysis revealed that CD69
expression was the only factor that predicts response to
bendamustine independently from other biological and
clinical CLL features, pointing out a functional role of this
protein in the mechanisms of resistance to bendamustine.
CD69 is a type II integral membrane protein
belonging to the C-type lectin family of surface receptors
and is expressed in all bone marrow-derived cells, with
the exception of erythrocytes [39]. CD69 is not found
on resting circulating lymphocytes in humans, although
in vitro cell activation showed rapid induction on human
T and B lymphocytes This surface protein is commonly
used as the marker of activated cells, most often in
lymphocytes and natural killer cells [40]. Recently, it
has also been described to be a key regulator of immune
responses and one of the major regulators of lymphocyte
migration, particularly at the mucosal sites [41]. In CLL,
CD69 has been reported to be an independent prognostic
marker that significantly correlates with poor clinical
and biological prognostic factors such as the number of
treatment lines, the mutational status of the IGHV genes,
and the expression of CD38, ZAP-70 and CD49d [42,
43]. In our study, we confirmed the correlation between
CD69 and CD38 expression and the association between
previous treatment and bendamustine cytotoxicity in vitro.
Of note, the GSEA analysis also showed that those CLL
cases with high expression of CD69 and low response to
bendamustine had a similar expression profile of CD38
and ZAP-70 positive CLL cells [27, 28].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Furthermore, our results provided evidence that
microenvironment-driven resistance to bendamustine
is accompanied by the up-regulation of CD69 in CLL
cells considering both mesenchymal and dendritic cell
co-culture systems. This cytotoxic protection by the
microenvironment has been reported previously by our
group [20, 22] and others [32, 44]. In line with these
results, we observed that tissue-derived CLL cells had
higher CD69 expression levels than their peripheral blood
counterparts as previously reported [31, 45]. Accordingly,
we demonstrated that both LN- and BM-derived CLL
cells were less sensitive to bendamustine than their PB
counterparts. On this basis, we postulate that the in vivo
bendamustine sensitivity could be explained, at least
partially, by the microenvironment-mediated induction of
CD69 expression on CLL cells.
This hypothesis prompted us to test if CD69high
CLL cells without p53 alterations (CD69 expression
> 30%)[43] could be sensitized to bendamustine with
some therapeutic strategy. In this context, it has been
described that the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib was able to
decrease CD69 surface levels on CLL cells in vivo [34].
We confirmed that ibrutinib is able to down-regulate
CD69 levels and that bendamustine plus ibrutinib have
a cooperative antitumor effect. These data agree with the
promising results reported in clinical trials evaluating the
safety and the efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with
bendamustine-based regimens in relapsed CLL [18, 46].
As preclinical investigation of the combination of ibrutinib
and rituximab resulted in an antagonistic effect [47], it is
conceivable that bendamustine might play an important
role in the potentiation of ibrutinib effect. Our results
showed that the PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib also decreased
CD69 levels and enhanced bendamustine-induced
cytotoxicity in primary CLL cells. In this regard, there
are ongoing clinical trials evaluating the combination of
bendamustine-based regimens and idelalisib [48, 49]. We
can hypothesize that the two approved targeted therapies
in CLL cells, ibrutinib and idelalisib, although they differ
considerably from each other, not only in target but also
in mechanism of action, could facilitate bendamustine
in vivo activity. By disruption of the microenvironmentsupporting growth, both drugs result in the egress of the
tumor cells from lymphoid tissues to peripheral blood,
where microenvironment signals are much weaker
and bendamustine might exert a greater effect. In this
sense, experiments in mouse models have reported that
bendamustine is mainly confined to the extracellular fluid
and not extensively distributed to tissues [50]. Through
this mechanism, CLL cells mobilized after treatment with
ibrutinib could be sensitive to apoptotic-triggering drugs
[19].
In summary, our results support a role of the
activation marker CD69 in the resistance of CLL cells
to bendamustine, suggesting that its surface levels
could predict response of patients to this compound.

Furthermore, we propose that bendamustine efficacy could
be increased by its combination with the state-of-the-art
BCR pathway inhibitors ibrutinib or idelalisib, as both
drugs were able to decrease CD69 levels and therefore
sensitize CLL cells to bendamustine. These combinations,
already in clinical trials, could be a potential strategy to
treat poor prognosis CD69high CLL cases as well as to
contribute to the achievement of complete remissions
during treatment with these targeted therapies.

in PB, BM and LN compartments, cells were triple-stained
with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD19 (Becton
Dickinson), Annexin-V-FITC and PI. Labeled samples
were analyzed on an Attune focusing acoustic cytometer
(Life Technologies). Cytotoxicity (mean ± SEM) was
calculated as the percentage of Annexin-V-positive cells
in treated samples relative to the untreated ones.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Gene expression analysis
CD19+ tumor CLL cells were purified from 38
CLL cases as previously reported [3]. Total RNA was
isolated from these samples using TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA integrity was examined with the Bioanalyzer 2100
(Agilent Technologies) and only high quality samples were
hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip HT HG-U219 perfectmatch-only (PM) Array Plate, following Affymetrix
standard protocols. The Expression Console software
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to get the
summarized expression values by the Robust Multi-array
Analysis (RMA). The raw data have been deposited in the
Gene Expression Omnibus Database (accession number
GSE68163).
DEGs were identified by using a Rank Products
(RP) test through the Multiexperiment Viewer Platform
(TM4-MeV), which is based on a two-class unpaired
analysis as previously described [53], using a FDR below
0.01. Genes with a fold-change below 1.5 were discarded.
The list of DEGs was used to conduct a functional
enrichment analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway analysis
(IPA)(Ingenuity® Systems) and applying a specific filter
for human B lymphocytes and lymphoma/leukemia cells.
Gene signatures with an expression pattern
correlating with sensitivity to bendamustine were
identified with GSEA version 2.0 (Broad Institute at MIT;
http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/) using the C2 (curated
gene sets) collection from the Molecular Signature
Database v2.5. An increasing profile analysis with 1000
permutations of gene sets and a weighted metric was used.
Gene sets with an FDR below 0.05 were considered.

Isolation and culture of primary cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
80 patients diagnosed with CLL according to the World
Health Organization criteria [51] were used in this study.
Clinical and biological data of these cases are summarized
in Table 1 and detailed in Supplemental Table 1.
The IGHV gene mutational status was determined
according to European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC)
guidelines [52]. Percentage of tumor cells (CD19+,
CD5+) and expression of ZAP-70, CD38 and CD49d
were determined by flow cytometry. The identification of
cytogenetic aberrations involving 11q22-23 (ATM), 13q14
and 17p13 (TP53) deletions and trisomy 12 was done
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Recurrent
mutations were obtained from previous whole genome/
exome sequencing studies [4].
Primary cells were isolated from PB or BM samples
by Ficoll-Paque sedimentation (GE-Healthcare). Primary
cells from LN were obtained after squirting with RPMI
1640 (Life Technologies) culture medium using a fine
needle. Samples were cryopreserved and stored within the
Hematopathology collection of our institution registered
at the Biobank from Hospital Clínic-IDIBAPS (R121004094). The ethical approval for this project including the
informed consent of the patients was granted following
the guidelines of the Hospital Clínic Ethics Committee.
Thawed cells were cultured in fresh RPMI 1640,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM
glutamine and 50 µg/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Life
technologies) and cultured in a humidified atmosphere at
37ºC containing 5% carbon dioxide.

Quantitative real-time PCR

Analysis of cytotoxicity

Total RNA was isolated as above from CLL cells,
and complementary DNA was obtained using the Reverse
Transcription Master Mix (Fluidigm Corporation).
Samples were processed to Speciﬁc Target Ampliﬁcation
using the PreAmp Master Mix (Fluidigm Corporation)
and the corresponding TaqMan Gene Expression Assays
(Life Technologies). PCR was run as recommended by the
manufacturer in a 96.96 Dynamic Array-Gene Expression
IFC (Fluidigm Corporation). The relative expression

Primary CLL cells were incubated for 24 hours
with a physiological dose of 25 µM bendamustine, kindly
provided by Mundipharma. When indicated, CLL cells
were pretreated for 24 hours with 0.5 µM of the PI3Kδ
inhibitor idelalisib and 1 µM of the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib
(Selleck Chemicals) prior to bendamustine addition. Cell
viability was quantified by double staining with Annexin-V

to six genes. The RMSE metric was used to compare the
performance of each model, which was estimated using
the errorest function in the ipred package of R software
with 800 bootstrap samples. Normality of the residuals
was checked for the models with lowest RMSE. Lower
values of RMSE indicate better fit of the model.
To confirm the independence of candidate predictors
from clinical variables, a stepwise linear regression with
backward elimination of the non-significant variables was
performed. All linear regression models were calculated
using R software. Statistical significance was considered
when p-value < 0.05 (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P <
0.001).

Quantification of CD69 and CD11b levels by flow
cytometry
Cell suspensions from PB, LN and BM were
washed and blocked with 10% mouse serum (Sigma).
Samples were then stained with anti-CD19-FITC (Becton
Dickinson), PI, and either anti-CD69-PE or anti-CD11bPE (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed in an Attune flow
cytometer. In each quantification experiment, a constant
calibrator sample was stained simultaneously. Expression
data was reported as the percentage of viable CLL cells
positive for CD69 or CD11b after subtraction of cells
stained for IgG1 isotype-PE (Becton Dickinson).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cell
line HS-5 (American Type Culture Collection)(ATCC®,
CRL­11882™) and human follicular dendritic cell-like
cell line HK (kindly provided by Dr. Y.S. Choi) were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM,
Life Technologies) and Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium (IMDM, Life Technologies), respectively, and
supplemented as above. Before setting up the experiment,
HS-5 (2x104 cells) and HK cells (1x104 cells) were
plated overnight and, once obtained a confluent stromal
monolayer, CLL cells were added at a 1:10 (HS-5:CLL)
and 1:20 (HK:CLL) ratio. After 24 hours, CLL cells
were analyzed for CD69 expression. At that time, 25 µM
bendamustine was added for 24 hours and CLL viability
was analyzed by flow cytometry.

The authors declare no competing conflicts of
interest.

Statistical analysis
Spearman correlation was used to evaluate the
dependence of bendamustine cytotoxicity on gene or
protein expression. Mann Whitney U Test was used to
evaluate response differences among unpaired samples
and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used when the
samples were paired. These analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software).
Multivariate linear regression models were used
to determine the relationship between sensitivity to
bendamustine and gene, protein and/or clinical variables.
Logarithmic transformations were used when necessary to
correct for non-normal distributions.
In order to obtain the combination of validated genes
that best predicts the response to bendamustine, a linear
regression model was fitted for each combination of one
