ABSTRACT
Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infects human genital mucosa and
establishes life-long latent infection. It is unmet need to establish a human cell-based
microphysiological system for virus biology and anti-viral drug discovery. One of
barriers is lacking of culture system of normal epithelial cells in vitro over decades. In
this study, we established human normal vaginal epithelial cell (HNVEC) culture using
co-culture system. HNVEC cells were then propagated rapidly and stably in a defined
culture condition. HNVEC cells exhibited a normal diploid karyotype and formed the
well-defined and polarized spheres in matrigel three-dimension (3D) culture, while
malignant cells (HeLa) formed disorganized and nonpolar solid spheres. HNVEC cells
had a normal cellular response to DNA damage and had no transforming property
using soft agar assays. HNVEC expressed epithelial marker cytokeratin 14 (CK14)
and p63, but not cytokeratin 18 (CK18). Next, we reconstructed HNVEC-derived 3D
vaginal epithelium using air-liquid interface (ALI) culture. This 3D vaginal epithelium
has the basal and apical layers with expression of epithelial markers as its originated
human vaginal tissue. Finally, we established an HSV-2 infection model based on the
reconstructed 3D vaginal epithelium. After inoculation of HSV-2 (G strain) at apical
layer of the reconstructed 3D vaginal epithelium, we observed obvious pathological
effects gradually spreading from the apical layer to basal layer with expression of a
viral protein. Thus, we established an ex vivo 2D and 3D HSV-2 infection model that
can be used for HSV-2 virology and anti-viral drug discovery.

INTRODUCTION

HSV-2 infection are 417 million and 19.2 million people,
respectively [1]. The primary site of HSV-2 infection is
genital tract mucosal epithelium and viruses subsequently
replicate within vaginal keratinocytes [2]. The damaged
ulcerative genital tract mucosa provide opportunities
for other detrimental pathogens to readily invade the

Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) is one of the
most common genital pathogens and prevalent sexually
transmitted viruses. The latest global estimates for 2012

vagina [3]. HSV-2 infection not only establishes a lifelong
asymptomatic latency in the neurons of sensory ganglia
but also can be periodically reactivated and lead clinical
or subclinical palindromia. The viral reactivation and
ulcer disease by genital HSV-2 infection may increase
5-fold potential risk of HIV-1 transmitted efficiency and
in an up-regulation of HIV replication through transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV [4–6].
HSV-2 has recently been reported to be a risk factor
for Kaposi’s sarcoma [7]. At present clinical anti-viral
therapies mainly target the process of HSV-2 reactivation
but not eliminate latent viruses [8]. Currently, there is no
effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine available for
genital HSV-2 infection [9]. One of the major reasons is
lacking of virus research system which is close to human
physiological conditions in vitro.
The genital mucosa is not only the first physical
line of defense against HSV-2 infection but also involves
in orchestrating innate immunity and adaptive immunity
[10]. Genital epithelium is layered and polarized epithelial
tissue which shapes two distinct surfaces for apical and
basolateral domains. The morphology and the degree of
differentiation of epithelial tissues play an important role
in viral immune response. The replication of HSV-2 in
genital mucosal epithelium and the continued spread to
nervous system have largely depended on the polarized
epithelium [11]. The conventional two dimensional (2D)
culture has obvious limitations as viral infection model.
There also exist inherent differences between human and
animal. The anti-HSV-2 vaccines tested on traditional
animal models are hardly applied to clinic treatments [4].
Therefore, it is of great importance to establish a human
cell-based microphysiological system for virus biology
research.
Recently researchers have gained their attentions
to this point. A Canadian group established an ex vivo
culture model and investigated the susceptibility of
primary human female genital epithelial cells to HSV-2
[10]. They also assessed the anti-viral activity of human
female genital epithelium in response to HSV-2 and the
role of HSV-2 virion host shutoff protein on dsRNA
antiviral pathways in human vaginal epithelial cells
[12]. Another report demonstrated that HSV-2 infection
induces CXCL9 expression in primary cervical epithelial
cells and recruits activated CD4(+) T cells to mucosal
HSV-2 infection sites and potentially increases the risk
of HIV-1 sexual transmission [13]. We also established
immortalized human cervical epithelial (HCE) cells in
vitro model and demonstrated that TLR4 plays a critical
role in innate immune response to HSV-2 infection [14–
16]. However, human normal tissue-derived primary
cells will undergo senescence after very limited passages
in vitro, resulting in a poor stability and repeatability of
experiments. The immortalized cells by exogenous genes
transduction often change their genetic background and

phenotype [17]. Therefore, these immortalized cells lost
the normal physiological functions [18].
In the current study, we isolated the primary human
normal vaginal epithelial cells (HNVEC) by irradiated
feeder co-culture technology [18]. The primary cells
propagate stably and rapidly in vitro and retain the
normal biological characteristics. Most importantly, we
successfully reconstructed the polarized vaginal epithelium
using the three-dimensional (3D) air-liquid interface
(ALI) culture and verified its morphological features
identical to the originated vaginal tissue. Furthermore, we
established a novel HSV-2 infection model with 3D ALI
cultures. This ex vivo 3D viral infection model possesses
the susceptibility to HSV-2. We observed the replication
of virus and viral pathological effects in a time-depended
manner. This 3D HSV-2 infection model may provide a
human cell-based microphysiological system more close
to the natural infection process of HSV-2 for virus biology
research and anti-viral drug discovery.

RESULTS
Isolation and propagation of human normal
vaginal epithelial cells (HNVEC)
The vaginal tissues were digested and dispersed into
the single cells as described in Materials and Methods.
Initial culture was established with irradiated feeder
fibroblasts. After 2 days of plating, small colonies were
readily observed. Then epithelial cells were cultured in a
defined medium as described in Materials and Methods.
HNVEC cells proliferated rapidly to reach confluence in
approximately 5 to 6 days. Images of HNVEC cells cocultured with feeder cells and in primary epithelial culture
medium (PECM) were shown in Figure 1A and 1B,
respectively. The Short Tandem Repeats (STR) analysis
(DNA fingerprinting) was performed in order to confirm
the uniqueness of HNVEC. HNVEC cells have 21 STR
loci and a couple of X-chromosome-specific Amelogenin
loci (Supplementary Figure 1A). STR analysis verified
that HNVEC cells were originated from a specific
individual and do not match any other cell lines published
or registered in the database of ATCC, DSMZ, JCRB
and RIKEN. HNVEC cells proliferated rapidly and the
cell numbers were recorded at each passage. The growth
curve of HNVEC cells was plotted as accumulative
population doublings versus days. Figure 1C showed a
constant growth of HNVEC cells with 50 accumulated
population doublings for 133 days. Telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) is the active subunit of telomerase
which maintains the telomere’s length during cell
division. Usually the hTERT expression is turned off
in most somatic cells, while tumor-derived cell lines
have reactivated hTERT expression. Telomerase plays a
critical role in primary cell immortalization and hTERT

expression was induced in conditionally reprogrammed
primary normal epithelial cells [18, 19]. To analyze the
hTERT activation, total RNAs of HNVEC cells were
harvested at passage 4, 14, 24, 34 and the expression of
hTERT was detected by quantitative RT-PCR as described
in Materials and Methods. The expression of hTERT was
induced at the very early passage (p4) in HNVEC cells
and declined thereafter (Supplementary Figure 1B). The
tendency was maintained stably at late passages (p14, p24,
p34). As a control, the cancer cells (HeLa) have a much
higher expression of hTERT. The results demonstrated
that HNVEC cells sustained a continuous and stable
proliferation status during the period of passaging.

of p21CIP1 is able to immediately arrest cell cycle at G1
phase and restraint malignant propagation [19, 20]. In
most exogenous genes (such as hTERT or HPV16-E6/
E7) induced immortalized cells or cancer-derived cell
lines (such as HeLa cells), the p53 signal pathways
generally exhibit mutant or suppressed status. To verify
whether HNVEC have the intact p53-mediated growth
related pathways and normal function to respond to the
DNA damage, HNVECs were treated with a low dose of
actinomycin D (Act D) for 24 hrs, HeLa cells were used
as the control. Act D triggers nucleolar disruption [21] and
induces DNA strand breakage, leading to p53-dependent
cell growth arrest [19]. As shown in Figure 2B, p53
protein level was up-regulated in HNVECs with ActD
treatment and the downstream effector p21CIP1was also
increased compared to untreated HNVEC cells. However,
in HeLa cells treated with Act D, p53 protein level was not
upregulated and neither p21CIP1was induced compared to
untreated HeLa cells. Thus, HNVEC cells possess a normal
response to DNA damage. The differential potential of
cells is one of cellular hallmarks of normal physiological
function. To evaluate the differential potential of HNVEC
cells, we performed matrigel 3D cultures. Matrigel
basement membrane matrix, a kind of extracellular matrix
(ECM) rich in laminin, is a critical regulatory factor to
retain normal homeostasis and tissue morphology [22, 23].
As relevant important signal pathways are usually lost in
traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture using plastic
substrata, matrigel 3D culture was able to discriminate
between benign or malignant mammary cells [24].

HNVEC cells maintain normal karyotypes and
response to DNA damage and non-oncogenic
The histology of the mirrored structure of specimen
confirmed no contamination of tumor lesions in the normal
vaginal tissues (Supplementary Figure 2A). Next, we
analyzed whether HNVEC cells harbored any abnormal
karyotype by the conventional cytogenetic analysis.
Figure 2A demonstrated that HNVEC cells possess a
structurally and numerically normal karyotype with a
46,XX. The tumor suppressor gene p53 effectively arrests
the aberrant cells suffered from genetic damage and
prevents abnormal proliferation. The expression of p53
is increased if normal cells experienced gene damage.
The increased expression of p53 activates the activity of
downstream effector p21CIP1. The up-regulated expression

Figure 2C showed that HNVEC cells formed well-defined
and polarized spheres in this 3D context, while HeLa
cells (a cervical cancer cell line) generated proliferous,
disorganized and nonpolar solid aggregates. Thus, HNVEC
cells have a normal function to differentiate in matrigel
3D culture. We also evaluated the transforming property
of HNVEC cells by soft agar assay. Since anchorageindependent growth is a representative feature of tumor
cells in vitro proliferation. As shown in Supplememtary
Figure 2B, HeLa cells readily grew as scobinate and
anchorage-independent colonies. In contrast, HNVEC cells
did not form cell colonies and existed in the form of single
cells or cell debris in soft agar culture for 30 days. These
data indicated that HNVEC cells have normal biological
characteristics.

without keratinized cell layers. The cytokeratins
expression of ectocervix in stratified squamous epithelium
immediately above the basal layers displayed positive
for CK14. In columnar endocervix as well as in cervical
adenocarcinoma, CK18 was observed positive while
CK14 negative [25]. Therefore, the immunofluorescence
assay was performed to examine the expression
of CK14 and CK18 of HNVEC cells. As shown in
Figure 3, the cytokeratin expression of normal HNVEC
cells was positive for CK14 and negative for CK18. This
data verified that HNVEC cells were originated from
the stratified squamous epithelium of ectocervix. Since
conditionally reprogrammed cells represent a stem-like
state and possess the ability of indefinite proliferation
in vitro [26]. We also detected the expression of p63 which
is an essential transcription factor for morphological
development and stemness maintenance of stratified
epithelial structures [27]. The expression of p63 was
readily observed in the nuclei of HNVEC cells by
immunofluorescence (Figure 3).

HNVEC cells express CK14 and p63, not CK18
The normal cervical epithelium contains two
obviously morphological types: one is non-keratinized
squamous epithelium lining the ectocervix (the vaginal
portion of the cervix); and the other is columnar mucussecreting epithelium attaching to the endocervical canal
and its corresponding glands. The vaginal wall tissues,
affiliated to ectocervix, are rich in vaginal epithelial
cells which belong to stratified squamous epithelium

basolateral domains [28]. The above data showed that
HNVEC cells have the normal biological features and
differentiated potential. Therefore, we reconstructed
the polarized vaginal epithelium using 3D air-liquid
interface (ALI) culture as described in Materials and
Method. We compared the epithelial structures between
the originated vaginal tissue and constructed 3D culture
by H&E staining (Figure 4). HNVEC-derived 3D culture
displayed the typical stratified epithelium with polarity
similar to its originated vaginal tissue. The basal epithelial
cell layers with stemness proliferation, intermediate
transformation zone and superficial keratinized cell layers
were distinctly observed. The data indicated that HNVEC
cells establish a well-differentiated squamous epithelium
with polarization under a stress force of differentiation.
To further verify whether reconstructed 3D cultured
vaginal epithelia have the identical epithelial specificity
to the original vaginal tissue, six markers (CK14, CK18,
p63, Laminin, E-cadherin and Dsg-1) were detected
using immunohistochemical assay (Figure 5, Figure 6
and Figure 7). Desmoglein-1 (Dsg-1) plays a pivotal
role in compensating for tight junctions in multiple
epithelial tissues [29] and normally expresses in the
human epidermis, throughout all nucleate cell layers [30].
Cell-to-cell adhesion, a typical characteristic of human
epithelium, is mediated by a vital calcium-dependent
receptor called Epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin) [31].
E-cadherin-mediated adhesion greatly contributes to
maintaining the integrity of epithelium in homeostasis
of internal micro-environment, and balancing the
communication between intracellular junction and cell

proliferation [32]. The expression pattern in the original
vaginal tissue was: p63 expressed in the nuclei of basal
epithelial cell layers (Figure 6); CK14 (Figure 5) and
Laminin (Figure 6) expressed in the cytoplasm of basal
layers, E-cadherin and Dsg-1 (Figure 7) expressed both
in the cytoplasm of basal layers and transformation zone
(the expression level of Dsg-1 is higher than that of
E-cadherin); CK18 (Figure 5) not expressed in all cell
layers compared with negative control (Supplementary
Figure 3) . Reconstructed 3D culture showed the similar
expression pattern as the corresponding vaginal tissues.
Taken together, the reconstructed 3D cultures represent
an ex vivo model which mimics the histological structure
of vaginal epithelium in morphology and physiologic
function.

Establishment of reconstructed 3D vaginal
epithelium HSV-2 infection model
On the basis of reconstructed normal HNVECderived 3D model, we established a HSV-2 infected
vaginal epithelium 3D model. The ALI 3D cultures were
inoculated with HSV-2 (G strain, 4 × 105 PFU/well) at the
apical layers after HNVEC ALI cultures maintained for
12 days. At the indicated time points, 0, 12, 24, 48, 72,
and 96 hrs p.i., the 3D cultures were collected and fixed.
The morphological alterations of HNVEC-derived 3D
model after HSV-2 entry were examined by H&E staining
(Figure 8A). At 0 hrs p.i., 3D vaginal cultures formed
a normal stratified squamous epithelium structure and
intact basal cell layers with compact-arranged keratinized

Figure 3: HNVEC cells express CK14, not CK18. The HNVEC cells were cultured on the sterile glass cover slips at an appropriate
density and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X-100 and labeled with the primary antibodies against
CK14, CK18 and p63 respectively. These three protein makers were detected by immunofluorescence assay. The nuclei were stained by
0.5 μg/ml DAPI. The proteins were stained by second antibody goat-anti-mouse IgG—Cy3. Scale bar, 500 μm.

epidermis. As early as 12 hrs after HSV-2 infection, the
keratinized epidermis became loosed. The keratinized
layers of the apical stratified epithelium became gradually
incompact and detached upon 24 hrs and 48 hrs p.i.. After
72 hrs of viral infection, most of the keratinized layers
of apical surface were lost and the loose appearance
reached the basal layers. Even the basal cell layers were
damaged and became very thin at 96 hrs p.i. (Figure 8A).
Meanwhile, the observation that the interior of 3D cultures
tuned wet (medium permeated from bottom of the inserts)
indicated the damaged air-liquid interface environment.
Therefore, we detected the expression of Laminin and
two other epithelial tight junction markers, E-cadherin
and Dsg-1, by immunohistochemical assay (Figure 8B,
8C, 8D). The results showed that the integrity of 3D
vaginal epithelium tight junction was being destroyed
gradually from the apical surface to basal layers as the
time went on after HSV-2 infection. The pathological
changes of 3D cultures throughout all the cell layers in
vaginal epidermis were clearly observed.
Glycoprotein B (gB), a late expression protein of
herpes simplex virus (HSV), is widely considered to be
a highly conserved envelop glycoprotein. gB protein is
most abundant in HSV which can specifically recognize
and bind to an appropriate receptor on the membranes of
the host cells to initiate the membrane fusion process [33].
HSV-2 enters into the host cells through with a fusion of
either plasma or endosomal membrane with the help of

this recognition. Therefore, we investigated the expression
of gB protein in the reconstituted vaginal 3D epithelium
by immunofluorescence assay. The gB protein was not
expressed in 3D culture at 0 hrs p.i. (Figure 8E). As
early as 12 hrs post infection, gB protein was obviously
observed on account of transcription of viral protein after
HSV-2 absorption and penetration into the host cells. The
expression level of gB protein was slightly decreased at
24 hrs p.i. till 48 hrs p.i.. And then the level of gB protein
expression increased at 72 hrs p.i. and reached the peak
at 96 hrs p.i. (Figure 8E). Along with the progression of
viral infection and lytic release of the virions, HSV-2
proliferated and replicated in the reconstructed 3D vaginal
epithelium and destroyed the epithelial cell layers as well
as cell-cell tight junctions. The obvious pathological
effects gradually spread from the apical layer to basal
layer in a time-depended manner. This reconstituted
3D viral infection model manifested the susceptibility
to HSV-2 invasion and the pattern of internal virus
infection. These results are expected to provide an ex vivo
microphysiological system more close to the situation of
natural infection of HSV-2.

DISCUSSION
HSV-2 infection is mainly implicated in epithelial
cells [34]. The latent-period viruses are prone to be
periodically reactivated and lead to life-threatening

recurrent diseases [35]. Currently treatments with antiviral therapy do not eliminate latent viruses. There is
no effective preventative or therapeutic vaccine and
drug available for genital HSV-2 infection [9]. It is of
great importance to establish a human cell-based micro-

physiological system for further HSV-2 biology research
and anti-viral drug discovery.
In vitro culture of normal epithelial cells has been a
big challenge over decades. The normal cells experience
two critical phases during proliferation: senescence (M1

phase) and crisis (M2 phase) [36]. The transduction of
exogenous genes, for example HPV E6/E7, can make
normal cells span both M1 and M2 phases and be
immortalized [18, 36]. Genetic manipulations frequently
resulted in the changes of genetic backgrounds, the
failures of normally physiological functions, as well as
the inhibitions of some important signal pathways [18].

Animal models are also mostly used as the research
tools to develop anti-viral drugs or vaccines. In the
past five years, numerous promising prophylactic or
therapeutic anti-HSV-2 vaccines are tested on animal
models, the most frequently used are mice and guinea pigs
[37]. The inherent differences between human and other
mammalians always hinder the applications of animal

models to human diseases. The viral research system
which is close to human physiological conditions is still
highly desirable.
Most recently, conditionally reprogrammed cells
technology provides a solution [18]. This technique can
efficiently establish normal epithelial cell cultures from
different mammalian tissues by using fibroblast feeder
cells and a Rho kinase inhibitor, without transduction

of exogenous genes. These reprogrammed cells can
proliferate indefinitely and rapidly in vitro and retain
a normal karyotype and non-tumorigenicity. The
most important finding is that the induction of the
reprogrammed cells is reversible, removal of Rho kinase
inhibitor and feeders allows the cells to differentiate
normally [26]. Reprogrammed cells may represent an
adult stem-like state of epithelial cells. The activation of

showed that HNVEC cells formed well-defined and
smooth spheres [22, 38].
Since the normal functional epithelium has
physiological polarity in vivo and form two distinct
surfaces according to their different distribution of
transmembrane proteins and lipids: the apical domain
and the basolateral domain. The former mainly faces to
the outside atmosphere and pernicious pathogens, and
the latter contacts with the bottom cells and systemic
vasculature [28]. The polarized structure of epithelia play
a significant role in the invasion and release of the virus
which perhaps alternatively infect either the apical domain
or the basal domain [39]. For instance, the SV40 viruses
are inclined to infect the bodies from apical domain
[40], while the VSV and Semliki Forest virus are apt to
invade from basal domain [41, 42]. So, 2D culture system
cannot satisfy our demands for further exploration of
viral researches. 3D culture, a widely-utilized cell culture
system in vitro, can be employed to visualize the cellular
basis of morphogenesis in epithelial cells and develop the
currently popular individual-based treatments [43–45].
The polarized epithelium 3D models recapture the growth
and differentiation in vivo environment and overcome
the species-discrepant limitations of animals, therefore
representing a fire-new ex vivo model for viral biological
research.
In this study, the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture
has been applied to reconstitute the polarized and stratified
vaginal epithelium 3D model. HNVEC-derived 3D culture
displayed the typical stratified epithelium with polarity
similar to its originated vaginal tissue (Figure 4). They
commonly expressed the specific keratin marker CK14
(Figure 5), stemness-maintained marker p63 (Figure 6)
and cell-to-cell tight junction proteins E-cadherin and
Dsg-1 (Figure 7). More importantly, we established a
HSV-2 infected vaginal epithelium 3D model on the basis
of reconstructed normal HNVEC-derived 3D model.
The pathological changes of 3D cultures after HSV-2
entry throughout all the cell layers were clearly observed
(Figure 8A). The expression of two epithelial tight
junction markers, Dsg-1 and E-cadherin, showed that the
integrity of 3D vaginal epithelium was being destroyed
gradually from the apical surface to basal layers as the
time went on after HSV-2 infection (Figure 8C and 8D).
The expression of viral protein, gB, demonstrated that the
progression of HSV-2 proliferation and replication in the
reconstructed 3D vaginal epithelium in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 8E). This reconstituted 3D viral infection
model manifested the susceptibility to HSV-2 invasion and
the pattern of internal virus infection.
The HNVEC cells generated using reprogrammed
cell technique and HNVEC-based 3D vaginal epithelium
are originated from the individual patient without any
genetic manipulation. The reprogrammed HNVEC
cells possess the normal biological characteristics
and reconstituted 3D vaginal epithelium mimics the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell isolation
With the written informed consent of the patient,
adjacent normal vaginal tissues from a surgical specimen
of vaginal tumor was collected. Institutional review
boards of Wuhan University Shenzhen institute and
Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital approved this
study. The normal tissue was obtained as far from the
tumor lesion as possible to avoid contamination of tumor
tissue for the specimen. In addition, mirror structure of
specimen was prepared for histological examination.
Uncontaminated specimen was immediately put into
the fresh clinical sample preservation medium and sent
to research lab. The mirror structure of specimen was
separated and performed histology experiments. The
other half of specimen was minced and dispersed into
the single cells with dispase plus collagenase (Stem
Cell Technologies Inc, Vancouver, Canada, BC). The
primary vaginal epithelial cells were cultured according
to co-culture protocol with irradiated feeder cells and
cells were then propagated in primary epithelial culture
basic medium (PECBM, ImmorTech, Shenzhen, China).
The recipe of primary epithelial culture medium was
described in early study [46]. The cells were cultured and
proliferated at 37°C in a humidified incubator, with 5%
CO2. The cell growth curve was plotted as accumulated
population doublings versus time (days)[19].

STR analysis
Cellular genome DNA of primary HNVEC cells was
extracted using a commercial kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China).
Short tandem repeat (STR) analysis (DNA fingerprinting)
was performed by commercial kit (PowerPlex21 System;
Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). This system
recognizes the co-amplification and three-color detection
of 22 loci (21 STR loci and the X-chromosome-specific
Amelogenin). The PCR amplification was achieved on the
basis of the manufacturer’s recommended protocol with
the ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Massachusetts, USA). The following STR markers were
detected except to the Amelogenin loci: Amel, CSF1PO,
D10S1248, D12S391, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51,
D19S433, D21S11, D2S1338, D2S411, D3S1358,
D5S818, D6S1043, D7S820, D8S1179, FGA, Penta D,
Penta E, TH01, TPOX, vWA. Allele size determination
and related data analysis were accomplished with
Genotyper and Power Typer 21 Macro Software (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA).

analysis)

(PFU)/ml. The HSV-2 stocks were usually frozen and
stored at −80°C in 1ml aliquots so as to ensure that every
aliquot of virus stocks was fresh for each experiment. Vero
cells were proliferated in complete Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 8% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
For virus infection, vaginal epithelium 3D culture was
infected with HSV-2 of 4 × 105 PFU/well. The virus
inoculums were removed after 2 hrs adsorption and fresh
differentiation medium (CELLnTEC Advanced Cell
Systems AG, Switzerland) was added. The 3D culture was
continued cultured in 37°C incubator until collected at the
indicated time points.

The exponentially growth HNVEC cells were treated
with 0.08 µg/ml colchicine for 3 hrs and observed to be a
tendency of cytomorphosis and cell rounding. Cells were
then collected and digested into 0.05% trypsin, continued
with a hypotonic treatment using 0.075 mol/L KCL and
fixation in the mixture of methanol and glacial acetic acid.
Mitosis metaphase spreads were stained with Giemsa dye
and imaged under the optical microscope. Approximately
twenty metaphase spreads were calculated the numbers of
chromosomes and analyzed their morphology under the
microscope (BX51TF, Olympus Company, Tokyo, Japan).

Western blotting analysis

Matrigel three-dimensional (3D) culture

HNVEC cells were added with or without a low
dose of 0.5 nM actinomycin D (Act D) for 24 hrs and
then scratched using a cell scraper into 200µl modified
radioimmuno-precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer
containing protease inhibitors as described in early
study [15] with HeLa cells as a control. The collected
protein samples were measured concentration by BCA
(Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) method
using microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek, Vermont,
USA). SDS polyacrylamide gels electrophoresis was
conducted and then transferred electrophoretically on to
a 0.2µm polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Immobilon-NC, Millipore, Italy), specifically probed with
following primary antibodies: mouse anti-p53 (1:1000,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA, sc-126), rabbit
anti-p21 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA,
sc-397) and mouse anti-β-actin (1:100, Proteintech Group,
Inc., Chicago, USA) 4°C overnight and then conjugated
with the following secondary antibodies: HRP-labeled
goat anti-mouse/rabbit lgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA). Immunoblots were colorated with an mixture
of enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ECL A and B
(Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) at a ratio of
1:1 and digitally photographed in UV trans-illuminator
(Bio-rad Laboratories, California, USA).

Single-cell suspensions of HNVEC and HeLa cells
were used and prepared into a specifically differential
medium (keratinocyte growth medium, Life Technologies
Corporation, California, USA) containing 5% pre-cooling
Matri-gel (Discovery Labware, Inc., Two Oak Park,
Bedford, MA). Matri-gel presents a liquid state at 4°C,
while solid phase at 37°C. The matrigel cultures were
incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator, with 5% CO2.
Morphogenesis assays (DAPI staining) were performed
after 7 days culture as previously described [22, 47]

Air-liquid interface (ALI) culture
Millicell PCF inserts (12mm size, Millipore,
Massachusetts, USA) were placed into a 6-well plate and
made them completely wet with PECBM (ImmorTech,
Shenzhen, China)before inoculating cells. Single-cell
suspensions of HNVEC with PECBM were prepared to
add into the each insert. About 2 ml PECBM was also
dropped into the well (outside the inserts). The 6-well plate
was then put in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, humidity)
and cultured about 48 hrs. PECBM was totally replaced
with differentiation medium (CELLnTEC Advanced
Cell Systems AG, Switzerland) inside and outside the
inserts and incubated for 16 hrs to allow cells to form an
intercellular adhesion structure. The fresh differentiation
medium was changed every 2 or 3 days. The 3D cultures
were differentiated approximately 14 days and then
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde to perform histology
experiments.

Immunofluorescence assay
The HNVEC cells were cultured on the sterile glass
coverslips to an appropriate density and fixed in 4% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X-100
and labeled the primary antibodies (1:100, mouse antiCK14, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, CA, sc-23878; 1:100,
mouse anti-CK18, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, CA, sc32329; 1:100, mouse anti-p63, Abcam, Cambridge, UK,
ab735) and the secondary antibodies (1:100, fluorescentlylabeled goat anti-mouse lgG-cy3, BA1031, Boster
company, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacture’s
protocol. The vaginal tissues and paraffin sections of 3D
cultures were solvent-dewaxed and treated with microwave

Virus infection
Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2,G strain) was
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
All stocks of HSV-2 used in this study were propagated in
Africa green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. The titer of virus
stocks was determined by a standard plaque assay and
titers were generally expressed with plaque-forming units

antigen retrieval. The primary antibodies (1:100, mouse
anti-HSV(1+2) gB, ab6506, Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
were incubated on the glass slides at 4°C overnight, then
detected with red fluorescently-labeled goat-anti-mouse
secondary antibodies (BA1031, Boster company, Wuhan,
China) at 37°C for an hour in the dark. Both nuclei were
performed counterstain with 0.5 ug/ml DAPI (Beyotime
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) for 10 mins at room
temperature. All the coverslips were mounted on the glass
slides using anti-quenching Fluoroshield™ histology
mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and visualized
under a fluorescence microscope (BX51TF, Olympus
company, Tokyo, Japan) with magnification 10 × or 20×.

vaginal tissues and 3D cultures were photographed under
the EVOS visual imaging microscope (Life Technologies
Corp Bothell, WA, USA).

Soft agar assay
Three microliter 0.6% low-melting point agarose
(Sigma-Aldrich, Louis, MO, USA) in culture medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, amphotericin) was
poured into a 6-well plate (three wells per group) and
allowed to solidification at room temperature after 1 hr.
After solidity, 3 × 104 cells were suspended in 500 µl
culture medium into 2 ml 0.3% low-melting point agarose
and placed on top of the bottom layer. All the cells were
grown at 37°C for 3–4 weeks. Colonies were visualized
and photographed under the visual imaging microscope.
The ability of forming colonies of different cells were
counted.

DAB staining (Amplifier Polymer)
The DAB staining was performed using a
commercial kit called DAB Detection Kit (EliVision Super
DAB, Maixin biotech company, Fuzhou, China). After
paraffin sections of vaginal tissues as well as 3D cultures
solvent-dewaxing and treatment with microwave antigen
retrieval, endogenic peroxidase blocker were added at
room temperature for 10 mins and the primary antibodies
mouse anti-p63 (1:100, ab735, Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
rabbit anti-Laminin (1:100, ab11575, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK), mouse anti-CK18 (1:100, sc-32329, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA, USA), mouse anti-CK14 (1:100, sc23878, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), mouse antiE-cadherin (1:100, sc-71008, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA), mouse anti-Dsg-1 (1:100, sc-13716, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) were respectively
incubated on the slides at room temperature for an hour.
The slides were then added the reaction-amplified reagent
for 20 mins and conjugated with high-sensibility enzymeconjugated lgG polymer. Reactants were visualized with
the fresh-prepared DAB chromogenic solutions for 3 to
5 mins. Hematoxylin somatic cell staining reagent was
used to counterstain nuclei for 8 mins. Glass slides were
finally mounted with neutral balsam and visualized under
EVOS visual imaging microscope (Life Technologies
Corp Bothell, WA, USA).

Total RNA extraction and taqman assay
hTERT mRNA expression in HNVEC cells was
assayed by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA
was extracted with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The
purity of RNA was determined according to denaturing
gel electrophoresis and identified by the ratio of protein
and nucleic acid optical density for 1.8 to 2.0. Two
microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA
using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(2090B, Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Dalian, China).
Amplification of human β-actin mRNA was an internal
control to normalized the amount of samples added to the
reaction. The first strand cDNA was used as a template
on the basis of TaqMan probe method to achieve PCR
amplification on a CFX96™ Real-Time System (Bio-rad,
California, CA, USA) using fast mode. The real-time PCR
procedure was set, and hTERT mRNA was measured
using the methods and primers that have been previously
published [18, 49, 50].
