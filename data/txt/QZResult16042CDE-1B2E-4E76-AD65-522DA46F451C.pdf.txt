Abstract

Introduction

CHR-2797 is a novel metalloenzyme inhibitor that is converted
into a pharmacologically active acid product (CHR-79888)
inside cells. CHR-79888 is a potent inhibitor of a number of
intracellular aminopeptidases, including leucine aminopeptidase. CHR-2797 exerts antiproliferative effects against a range
of tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo and shows selectivity
for transformed over nontransformed cells. Its antiproliferative effects are at least 300 times more potent than the
prototypical aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin. However, the
mechanism by which inhibition of these enzymes leads to
proliferative changes is not understood. Gene expression
microarrays were used to profile changes in mRNA expression
levels in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60
treated with CHR-2797. This analysis showed that CHR-2797
treatment induced a transcriptional response indicative of
amino acid depletion, the amino acid deprivation response,
which involves up-regulation of amino acid synthetic genes,
transporters, and tRNA synthetases. These changes were
confirmed in other leukemic cell lines sensitive to the
antiproliferative effects of CHR-2797. Furthermore, CHR2797 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR substrates
and reduced protein synthesis in HL-60 cells, both also
indicative of amino acid depletion. Treatment with CHR2797 led to an increase in the concentration of intracellular
small peptides, the substrates of aminopeptidases. It is
suggested that aminopeptidase inhibitors, such as CHR-2797
and bestatin, deplete sensitive tumor cells of amino acids by
blocking protein recycling, and this generates an antiproliferative effect. CHR-2797 is orally bioavailable and currently
undergoing phase II clinical investigation in the treatment
of myeloid leukemia. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6669–79]

A number of classes of Zn2+-metalloenzyme [e.g., matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP), aminopeptidases] have been implicated
in the regulation of tumor growth (1–3). As a class, MMP inhibitors
have not shown direct antiproliferative effects against human
cancer cells. One exception, however, is batimastat (BB-94), which
has been shown to exert an antiproliferative effect on the human
melanoma cell line RPMI-7951 (4). This observation led to the
discovery of a novel class of aminopeptidase inhibitor exemplified
by CHR-2797, which shows a powerful antiproliferative effect on
both hematopoietic and epithelial tumor cell lines.
Aminopeptidases catalyze the sequential removal of amino
acids from the amino-terminus of peptide substrates (5). Functions
of these enzymes include the regulation of biologically active
peptides, removal of the NH2 terminal methionine of newly
synthesized proteins, trimming of antigens for MHC class 1
presentation, and protein recycling (5–8). The aminopeptidase
inhibitor, bestatin, is a potent inhibitor of a number of metallopeptidase (M) family aminopeptidases (9) and exerts antiproliferative effects across a range of human tumor cell lines (10).
Furthermore, it has shown clinical efficacy in nonlymphocytic
leukemia and squamous cell lung carcinoma (3, 11).
The mechanism by which inhibition of aminopeptidases leads to
anticancer effects is not understood. In this study, gene expression
microarrays were used to profile changes in mRNA expression in a
human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) treated with CHR2797. By comparing the changes seen with those induced by treatment with the chemically dissimilar aminopeptidase inhibitor,
bestatin, and with an inactive analogue of CHR-2797, we sought to
discriminate between on-target and off-target effects of the compound.
We provide evidence that agents, such as CHR-2797, exert their
cellular effects through depletion of intracellular amino acids.
Aminopeptidase inhibition led to the appearance of intracellular
small peptides, the substrates of aminopeptidases, and, in sensitive
cells, to the induction of a well-defined transcriptional response,
the amino acid deprivation response (AADR), which involves upregulation of amino acid synthetic genes, transporters, and tRNA
synthetases. Aminopeptidase inhibition also reduced phosphorylation of mTOR substrates and rates of protein synthesis, both
indicative of amino acid depletion. Taken together, these data
suggest that drugs such as CHR-2797 and bestatin are able to
deplete many leukemic cells of intracellular amino acids, despite
their presence at high concentrations outside the cell. The control
of amino acid provision is emerging as a powerful physiologic and
pharmacologic mechanism for limiting cell proliferation.

6-h incubation of the cells with the two esters. Statistically significant increases at 6 h in cell-associated CHR-79888 were seen (unpaired t test, P < 0.0001).
Cells (4  104/mL) were incubated at 37jC in culture medium containing 6 Amol/L compound in a 5% (v/v) CO2-humidified atmosphere. Incubations were terminated
after 6 h by centrifugation of 25 mL aliquots of the cell suspension at 300  g for 5 min at 4jC. 0.2-mL samples of the culture media supernatants were added to
four volumes of acetonitrile. After decanting the supernatant, the residual cell pellet (106 cells) was extracted into 1 mL of acetonitrile. Samples were then analyzed for
the ester and acid metabolite at room temperature by LC/MS/MS (Sciex API3000). Chromatography was based on an AceCN (75  21 mm) column with a 5% to
95% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid mobile phase. For the zero time samples, the cell suspension was chilled and centrifuged as soon as the ester had been
added and then extracted into acetonitrile as described. The small amount of acid (CHR-79888) associated with the U-937 cells at zero time reflects acid formed
within the cell during the separation of cells and medium.

Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from HyClone. For amino acid deprivation,
cells were grown in amino acid–free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
(v/v) dialyzed FBS.
Cellular proliferation assays. Cells were seeded in 96-well BD-Falcon
plates (Becton Dickinson) at a density of 1 to 5  103 cells per well in the
appropriate serum-containing culture medium and cultured at 37jC in a
humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator for 24 h. Compounds were diluted in the
relevant culture medium and added to the wells for a further 72 h. During
the final 4 h of this incubation, cells were pulsed with 0.4 ACi/well of
[3H]thymidine (specific activity, 5 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences),

washed with PBS and seeded in 100 AL Cys/Met–free RPMI 1640 containing
compound, supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. 1.5 ACi [35S]Cys/Met
(Amersham Biosciences; >1,000 Ci/mmol) was added, and incubation
continued for 1 h at 37jC. Cells were captured onto 96-well GF/B filter
plates (Millipore) and washed twice with PBS before precipitation with 10%
ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 1 h at 4jC. Precipitated proteins were
washed four times with ice-cold 10% TCA and air-dried for 1 h. UltimaGold
scintillation cocktail (25 AL; PerkinElmer) was added and allowed to mix
for 1 h before scintillation counting using a 1450 MicroBeta scintillation

Results
In vitro studies. The MMP inhibitor batimastat (Fig. 1A–C)
inhibited the proliferation of a number of human tumor cell lines
in vitro (4). This was surprising as MMP inhibitors, in general, have
not been reported to exhibit antiproliferative effects (13). Because,
despite considerable effort, the antiproliferative effect of batimastat
and related agents could not initially be linked to inhibition of
any one intracellular metalloenzyme, compounds were optimized
using a cell-based assay: inhibition of U-937 cell proliferation. This
led to the synthesis of CHR-2797, an hydroxamate-containing ester
which was a potent inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation (Table 1A
and B; Figs. 1A–C; Supplementary Table S1A).
The acid derived from CHR-2797, CHR-79888 (Table 1A), was a
much weaker antiproliferative agent (IC50 versus U-937, HL-60, and
HuT 78 cells, >10 Amol/L; data not shown). Because charged acids
often have low ability to penetrate cells, this observation suggested
that an intracellular target might be responsible for the
pharmacologic action of these agents. This hypothesis was
substantiated by studies investigating the fate of CHR-2797 upon
incubation with human cells. Incubation of CHR-2797 with U-937
cells leads to its de-esterification and a time-dependent cell
accumulation of the acid CHR-79888 derived from this agent
(Fig. 1D). Certain related esters, such as CHR-5346, in which
the phenylglycine side chain of CHR-2797 is replaced by a
t-butylglycine group, are not hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases
and generate no charged acid (CHR-5515) inside cells (Fig. 1D). As
shown in Fig. 1A-C, CHR-5346 was a much weaker antiproliferative
agent than CHR-2797. For a large number of related esters,
generation of ester-derived acids inside the cell was essential for
potent in vitro antiproliferative activity (data not shown).
A range of intracellular metalloenzymes have been described,
including the aminopeptidases, thimet oligopeptidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase III. Attention was drawn to the aminopeptidase
family as a potential source of the CHR-2797 antiproliferative
target(s) by data on the aminopeptidase inhibitors, bestatin and
puromycin. These agents have been shown to exert an antiproliferative effect on a number of human tumor cell lines in vitro
(10, 14). When CHR-2797 was tested in aminopeptidase assays, it

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

was found to inhibit a number of these enzymes (Table 1A).
In particular, the intracellular aminopeptidases, LTA4 hydrolase,
LAP, and PuSA, were all potently inhibited by the intracellularly
accumulating acid CHR-79888 and are, therefore, potential drug
targets. All antiproliferative agents related to CHR-2797 retained
the ability to block these aminopeptidases. Other enzymes that
have been reported to be involved in tumor growth, such as
aminopeptidase N, PILSAP, and MetAP-2, were either insensitive to
CHR-2797 and its acid (PILSAP, MetAP-2) or exhibit an inappropriate cellular location (AP-N; extracellular) to be considered target
candidates (Table 1A).
In general, myeloid leukaemic breast and lung cancer cell lines
were the most sensitive to CHR-2797 (Table 1B; Supplementary
Table S1A). Lymphoma lines, such as HuT 78, were very insensitive
whether proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation
(Fig. 1C), WST-1 assay, or cell counting (Supplementary Tables S1B
and S1C). However, in this cell line [3H]thymidine incorporation is
uniquely and reliably enhanced by exposure to CHR-2797 and
related analogues (Fig. 1C). Although the reasons for this effect
remain unclear, exposure to bestatin produces a similar stimulatory
effect (Fig. 1C), emphasizing the qualitative, but not quantitative,
similarity between these agents (bestatin is usually 300–1,000 times
weaker than CHR-2797 as an antiproliferative agent; Fig. 1A–C).
There was no obvious correlation between sensitivity to CHR-2797
and the mutational status of p53, PTEN, or K-Ras in cells (Table 1B
and Supplementary Table S1A). Nontransformed stromal cells, such
as fibroblasts (e.g., MrC5 or NRK), were found to be more resistant
to the inhibitory effects of CHR-2797 than their oncogenically
transformed counterparts MrC5-SV2 or K-ras NRK, an effect not
seen with chemotherapeutic agents (Supplementary Table S2).
Flow cytometric analyses of the DNA profile of sensitive and
insensitive leukemic cells after incubation with CHR-2797 or its
nonhydrolyzable analogue CHR-5346 have been conducted. Results
of bivariate propidium iodide (PI)–BrdUrd analysis are summarized in Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig. S1. Pulsed
BrdUrd labeling of drug-treated cells, in combination with PI
staining, allowed an estimate of the active (BrdUrd+) and inactive
(BrdUrd ) S-phase fraction and the rate of DNA synthesis across
the entire S phase (including the G1-S and S-G2M boundaries).
In agreement with [3H]thymidine incorporation data, HL-60 and
U-937 cells showed a dramatic decrease in the active S-phase
fraction with no corresponding increase in the inactive S-phase
compartment (Supplementary Table S3). In HL-60 cells, this was
accompanied by a modest accumulation in G1. U-937 cells showed
only minimal G1 accumulation but showed a significant apoptotic
sub-G1 fraction. The absence of a significant increase in the
inactive S-phase fraction in either cell type suggests that the
decline in active S is a consequence of reduced feed-through from
G1. In the case of HL-60 cells, this may explain the G1-specific
accumulation (Supplementary Table S3). In U-937 cells, apoptosis
from G1 phase could explain the sub-G1 DNA profile and the
absence of any appreciable G1-specific cytokinetic effect. Apoptosis
induced by CHR-2797 in U-937 cells was also readily apparent
when assessed by Annexin V labeling (Supplementary Fig. S2). No
appreciable cytokinetic effects or apoptosis were seen in the
insensitive HuT 78 cell line (Supplementary Table S3 and
Supplementary Fig. S1).
In vivo studies. The efficacy of CHR-2797 has been investigated
in a range of in vivo tumor models, including syngeneic rat and
human tumor xenografts. CHR-2797 is active as an anticancer
agent in vivo in rodent cancer models, and a dose-response

mechanistic link between aminopeptidase inhibition and antiproliferative effects was investigated by gene expression profiling
in HL-60 cells treated with CHR-2797. Cells were treated with
vehicle or 6 Amol/L CHR-2797, equivalent to 200 the IC50 for its
inhibition of proliferation (30 nmol/L; Fig. 1A), for 6 and 24 h,
and gene expression changes were analyzed using Affymetrix
Whole Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. This concentration is
comparable with peak plasma levels seen in human subjects dosed
with CHR-2797 in on-going clinical trials.4 The complete list of
gene expression changes is included in Supplementary Table S4.
Approximately, 40% of the genes represented on the microarray
were expressed in HL-60 cells, and the expression of 2461 of these

were increased or decreased by z2-fold after treatment with
CHR-2797. Many of the up-regulated genes function in amino acid
transport (e.g., SLC7A11, cationic amino acid transporter, y+
system; SLC38A2, solute carrier family 38, member 2) and
metabolic pathways (e.g., ASNS, CBS, CTH; Table 2). Genes in these
pathways have been shown to be induced as part of an AADR, a
transcriptional response mounted by cells deprived of amino acids
whose primary purpose is to increase intracellular amino acid
levels (15, 16). Not all of the genes previously described as being
induced during this response function in amino acid transport or
metabolism (16–18), and a number of these genes were also upregulated by CHR-2797 treatment, including TRIB3, ATF5, DDIT3,
CDKN1A, VEGF, ATF3, CEBPB, and IL-8. These genes were also
up-regulated by amino acid deprivation in HL-60 cells (Table 2).
CHR-2797 treatment also led to the up-regulation of a number of
genes which have not previously been described as AADR genes.
Amino acid deprivation in HL-60 cells also led to the up-regulation
of these genes (Table 2), confirming them as novel AADR genes.
Some of these encode proteins involved in amino acid transport
and metabolism pathways, including CTH, SLC7A11, and CBS,

whereas others have a diverse range of other functions (e.g.,
CLEC-7A, SESN2, DDIT4, CCNG2, STC2, MGC4504, FYN, and
PPP1R15A). Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2), one of the most highly upregulated of these genes, is a secreted protein and, therefore, of
interest as a potential plasma-based pharmacodynamic marker.
Treatment of HL-60 cells with CHR-2797 led to an increase in the
secretion of STC2 protein into the growth medium (Supplementary
Fig. S5).
Because cells were treated with 6 Amol/L CHR-2797 (200 the
proliferation IC50) in the microarray study, gene expression induced
by lower concentrations of the compound was also examined.

Figure 2A shows a time-response and dose-response for two
representative genes, SLC7A11 and TRIB3. Increases in SLC7A11
expression were detectable at 60 nmol/L CHR-2797 (equivalent
to twice the IC50 for inhibition of proliferation) and as early as
2 h posttreatment.
To investigate the cell selectivity of the transcriptional response
to CHR-2797, two further leukemic cell lines were treated with
the compound: U-937 and HuT 78. The IC50s for inhibition of
proliferation by CHR-2797 in these cell lines are 10 nmol/L and
>10 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 1B and C). CHR-2797 treatment
increased expression of AADR genes in U-937 cells but not in HuT

PCR and compared with cells treated with 0.06% (v/v) DMSO (for compound treatments) or cells grown in normal growth medium supplemented with dialyzed
FBS (for amino acid deprivation). Statistically significant differences compared with control were seen for gene expression changes beyond 2 h (A , SLC7A11; unpaired

CHR-2797, an Antiproliferative Metalloenzyme Inhibitor

78 cells, which are insensitive to the antiproliferative effects
(Fig. 2B). Interestingly, although HuT 78 cells did not respond
transcriptionally to CHR-2797, the cell line did respond to amino
acid deprivation (Fig. 2C).
The aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin, is less active as an
antiproliferative agent than CHR-2797 but in HL-60 cells treated
with 200Amol/L bestatin (f10 the IC50 for inhibition of
proliferation), the expression of AADR genes was induced
(Fig. 2D), suggesting that the effects of CHR-2797 treatment result
from aminopeptidase inhibition. HL-60 cells, treated with CHR3204, a close analogue of CHR-2797 in which the hydroxamate
residue has been replaced with a non–metal-binding carboxamide
residue, is inactive as an antiproliferative agent and did not show
any AADR response (Fig. 2D). To determine if the transcriptional
response to CHR-2797 treatment was a nonspecific consequence of
cell death, HL-60 cells were treated with 200 ng/mL paclitaxel
(equivalent to 100 the IC50 for cell proliferation). No changes in
the expression of any of the AADR genes were noted (Fig. 2D).
The patterns of gene expression in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress response are somewhat similar to the AADR, although
the expression of the ER chaperone GRP78 is specific to ER stress
(19). Treatment of HL-60 cells with the ER stress inducer
thapsigargin (0.9 Amol/L; equivalent to 300 the IC50 for cell
proliferation, 3 nmol/L), but not deprivation of amino acids or
treatment with aminopeptidase inhibitors, led to the up-regulation
of GRP78 expression (Supplementary Fig. S6).
CHR-2797 treatment leads to phosphorylation of eukaryotic
initiation factor 2A. Under conditions of amino acid deprivation,
the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2a
is phosphorylated, inhibiting general protein synthesis but allowing
the translation of a few genes (20). One of these, the transcription
factor ATF4, is a regulator of the AADR. To determine whether the
transcriptional effects of CHR-2797 were mediated by this signaling
pathway, the levels of phosphorylated (Ser51) eIF2a were measured
in HL-60 cells treated with the compound. Amino acid deprivation
and treatment with CHR-2797 or bestatin caused an increase in
phosphorylated eIF2a (Fig. 3A). In agreement with the observed
transcriptional effects (Fig. 2C), amino acid deprivation, but not
CHR-2797 treatment, increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2a in
HuT 78 cells (Fig. 3A).
Aminopeptidase inhibition regulates mTOR activity. The
mTOR signaling pathway controls the rate of protein synthesis in
response to intracellular amino acid levels by phosphorylation of
its substrates, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, and the translational
repressor protein eIF 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1; refs. 21, 22).
In HL-60 cells, amino acid deprivation and treatment with bestatin
or CHR-2797, but not its inactive analogue, CHR-3204, caused a
decrease in the phosphorylation of both S6 kinase (Thr389) and
4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) at sites controlled by mTOR signaling (Fig. 3B
and C). In agreement with the transcriptional AADR effects
(Fig. 2C), amino acid deprivation, but not CHR-2797 treatment,
caused a decrease in the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4E-BP1
in HuT 78 cells (Fig. 3B and C).
CHR-2797 treatment inhibits protein synthesis. As CHR-2797
treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of key mTOR substrates,
the effects of the compound on protein synthesis were measured.
As expected, CHR-2797 treatment inhibited protein synthesis in
HL-60 cells at concentrations as low as 0.06 Amol/L (Fig. 3D). These
effects were much less pronounced in HuT 78 cells.
Aminopeptidase inhibition up-regulates expression of the
proapoptotic protein, NOXA. Because CHR-2797 causes death by

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptosis in a number of cell types, the gene expression microarray
data were analyzed for changes in the expression of genes
associated with apoptosis. The gene exhibiting the most marked
change in cells treated with CHR-2797 was NOXA. NOXA,
designated PMAIP1 on the microarray, a BH3-only proapoptotic
protein, was up-regulated by CHR-2797 treatment in HL-60 cells.
Like other AADR genes described, NOXA was also up-regulated
by amino acid deprivation and bestatin treatment, but not by the
inactive analogue of CHR-2797 (CHR-3204) or Taxol (Fig. 4A).
NOXA acts by sequestering the antiapoptotic protein, MCL1, and
the relative levels of these two proteins are finely controlled (23).
Neither amino acid deprivation, CHR-2797, nor bestatin treatment
increased MCL1 gene expression in HL-60 cells (data not shown).
As expected from the transcriptional effects, CHR-2797 treatment
increased NOXA protein levels without affecting levels of MCL1
(Fig. 4B).
Aminopeptidase inhibition leads to the appearance of
intracellular peptides. It seemed possible that inhibition of
aminopeptidases may deprive the cell of amino acids due to
impaired recycling of amino acids derived from postproteosomal
peptides. The effects of aminopeptidase inhibition on intracellular peptide concentrations were therefore examined. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 6 Amol/L CHR-2797 for 2 to 24 hours,
followed by mass spectroscopic analysis of cell lysates, led to the
discovery of a number of dipeptides and tripeptides in drugtreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). These peptides were also
detectable in HuT 78 cells treated with the compound (data not
shown). The proliferation of the HuT 78 cell line may be less
susceptible to aminopeptidase inhibition because it can access
amino acids from other sources, such as transmembrane influx.
As a result, no sign of an AADR response or antiproliferative
effect is seen in this cell line despite intracellular aminopeptidase inhibition.

Discussion
The discovery of CHR-2797 stemmed from the observation that
certain membrane-permeant compounds within a metalloenzyme
inhibitor–focused chemical library inhibited the proliferation of a
subset of tumor cell lines. The belief that the target enzyme is
located intracellularly is substantiated by the findings that only
esters that drive the accumulation of an acid inside the cell exert a
powerful antiproliferative action. In contrast, related compounds
which are poorly lipophilic are only weakly active in cell
proliferation assays despite good activity against the same class
of aminopeptidases, e.g., CHR-79888. The evidence that the target
for these effects lay within the cell focused attention on aminopeptidases, histone deacetylases, MetAP-2, or peptide deformylase
as intracellular metalloenzyme targets (2, 10, 24–26). CHR-2797 has
been shown to be inactive against a number of these targets
(histone deacetylase, MetAP-2) and/or to affect the proliferation of
a different spectrum of tumor cell lines than inhibitors of some of
these targets (histone deacetylase, peptide deformylase; refs. 25,
26). That the target is most likely to be one or more members of the
aminopeptidase class of metalloenzyme is indicated by the findings
that (a) all active antiproliferative agents related to CHR-2797
were aminopeptidase inhibitors and (b) tumor cells that were
sensitive to CHR-2797 were also sensitive to high concentrations of
bestatin, a well-established, structurally distinct, aminopeptidase
inhibitor (9). This agent is also thought to act within the cell:
(a) intracellularly hydrolysable bestatin esters are more potent

antiproliferative agents than bestatin itself (27)5 and (b) agents
that inhibit the extrusion of bestatin from the cell can enhance
its antiproliferative potency (28). Extensive studies in sensitive
leukemic cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) reagents
targeting individual intracellular aminopeptidases have failed to
provide convincing evidence that any single enzyme is responsible
for the effects of CHR-2797. Aminopeptidases, such as LAP and
PuSA, have overlapping substrate preferences, and it seems likely
that, for the siRNA approach to replicate the effects of CHR-2797,
it would be necessary to knockdown multiple aminopeptidases.
The antiproliferative effects of CHR-2797 most likely depend upon
the simultaneous inhibition of more than one intracellular
aminopeptidase.
CHR-2797 treatment of HL-60 cells up-regulated a number of
genes whose primary purpose seems to be to increase intracellular
amino acid levels (15, 16). These include, among other genes,
amino acid transporters and biosynthetic enzymes, the expression
of which are also induced by amino acid deprivation (e.g., SLC7A11,
SLC38A2, ASNS, CBS, CTH). Bestatin, a chemically dissimilar
aminopeptidase inhibitor, also induced the up-regulation of AADR
genes, whereas CHR-3204, an inactive analogue of CHR-2797, did

not. This suggests that the transcriptional effects of CHR-2797 are
a consequence of aminopeptidase inhibition. Other genes upregulated by CHR-2797 include a number whose protein products
are not directly related to amino acid transport or biosynthesis.
Some of these have previously been shown to be up-regulated by
amino acid deprivation (e.g., TRIB3, ATF5, DDIT3, CDKN1A, VEGF,
ATF3, CEBPB, and IL-8), whereas others seem to be novel AADR
genes (e.g., CLEC-7A, SESN2, DDIT4, CCNG2, STC2, MGC4504, FYN,
and PPP1R15A). Interestingly, a number of these genes seem to
function in negative feedback loops which attenuate the stress
response and ensure that, if and when nutrient levels return to
normal, cells are able to successfully recover. For example, the
pseudokinase TRIB3 acts as a negative feedback regulator of
ATF4-dependent transcription under conditions of amino acid
deprivation (29), and ATF3 acts as a transcriptional repressor of
AADR genes (30). Furthermore, PPP1R15A (GADD34) is a cofactor
of the eIF2a phosphatase PP1 (31) acting on eIF2a phosphorylation in a negative feedback loop, and DDIT4 (REDD1) has been
shown to act as a negative regulator of mTOR activity (32).
A small number of genes were up-regulated by CHR-2797
treatment in HL-60 cells but not by amino acid deprivation. ASS
and PSAT1 may be expected to be AADR genes, as they are both
involved in amino acid metabolism, and GADD45A has been shown
to respond to amino acid deprivation (33). Resistin (RETN), an
adipocyte-derived hormone, was significantly up-regulated by
CHR-2797 treatment in HL-60 cells but not by amino acid
deprivation. The regulation of this gene may, therefore, be a
consequence of aminopeptidase inhibition unrelated to intracellular amino acid depletion.
Amino acid deficiency is sensed by the kinase GCN2 (general
control nonderepressible kinase 2) by a mechanism that involves
uncharged tRNAs binding to a regulatory HisRS domain, homologous to histidyl tRNA synthetase enzymes (34). This leads to
autoactivation of its kinase domain and allows phosphorylation of
the a-subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2. Phosphorylated eIF2a inhibits recycling of eIF2 to its active GTP-bound form
and thereby reduces global protein synthesis (35). As expected from
the observed transcriptional effects of the compound, treatment of
HL-60 cells with CHR-2797, bestatin, or amino acid deprivation
increased phosphorylation of eIF2a.
The ER stress response is coordinated in a manner somewhat
similar to the AADR transcriptional response. ER stress is sensed by
the kinase PERK, which, like GCN2, phosphorylates eIF2a, leading
to a pattern of gene expression termed the unfolded protein
response (36). The expression of the ER chaperone GRP78 is
specific to the ER stress response (19). Treatment of HL-60 cells
with the ER stress inducer thapsigargin, but not amino acid
deprivation or aminopeptidase inhibition, led to the up-regulation
of GRP78 expression, suggesting that aminopeptidase inhibition
does not induce an ER stress response.
The mTOR signaling pathway also senses and responds to amino
acid levels inside cells, controlling rates of protein synthesis
accordingly. Two important substrates of this pathway are S6
kinase and 4E-BP1, and the phosphorylation and activity of both
proteins have been shown to be modulated by amino acid levels
(21, 22). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 releases it from eIF4E, allowing
formation of the eIF4F complex critical for cap-dependent
translation. In HL-60 cells, amino acid deprivation and treatment
with bestatin or CHR-2797, but not its inactive analogue, CHR3204, caused a decrease in the phosphorylation of both S6 kinase
(Thr389) and 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) at sites controlled via mTOR

signaling. 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated hierarchically at four sites via
mTOR signaling, with phosphorylation at Thr37/46 being required
for modification of other residues (37). Interestingly, the hyperphosphorylated (slowly migrating) form, whose binding to eIF4E is
completely blocked (38), is the form most significantly affected by
aminopeptidase inhibition in HL-60 cells (Fig. 3C).
The sensitivity of cells to CHR-2797 and other aminopeptidase
inhibitors, such as bestatin, varies considerably. In the case of
CHR-2797, this could be due either to variable carboxylesterase
activity within cells or to variable sensitivity to the pharmacologic
mechanism of the drug. The latter is the more likely because all cell
types that we have examined have the ability to accumulate CHR79888, the acid product of CHR-2797 (data not shown). Moreover,
bestatin, which is not an ester drug and is believed to enter cells
through a peptide transporter mechanism (39), shows a similar
tumor cell selectivity. The most likely explanation for variable
tumor cell sensitivity is that, although aminopeptidase inhibition
and peptide accumulation occur in all cells, only certain cell types
rely on the recycling of intracellular peptides for amino acid
provision. In other words, drug-responsive tumor cells run out of
amino acids, as judged by the AADR response, eIF2a phosphorylation, or mTOR inhibition, despite plentiful availability in the
extracellular medium. This amino acid–related phenomenon is not
unique to cancer cells. The parasite Plasmodium falciparum
replicates within host erythrocytes and during this part of its
life-cycle uses aminopeptidases, such as PfLAP, the Plasmodium
homologue of LAP, to catabolize large amounts of host hemoglobin
to its constituent amino acids (40). Bestatin and other aminopeptidase inhibitors inhibit at least two of the aminopeptidases which
are essential for growth and survival of the parasite. Interestingly,
the antiparasitic potency of bestatin is not substantially affected
by the presence or absence of extracellular amino acids (41),
implying, as here, that the parasite is entirely dependent on peptide
recycling for provision of adequate amino acid supplies.
These data highlight a further important facet of cell biology,
namely that regulation of amino acid provision can be used
physiologically or pharmacologically to control cell proliferation.
There is now considerable data indicating that control of
tryptophan levels in lymphocytes by macrophages and dendritic
cells via expression of the tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme,
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, serves to limit T-lymphocyte prolif-

eration (42, 43). Previous studies have shown that, in general,
human tumor cells are significantly more sensitive to amino acid
deprivation than normal cells (44–46). There is widespread upregulation in human tumors of certain amino acid transporters,
such as LAT1 (47, 48), presumably to meet the increased demands
for essential amino acids to take part in protein synthesis and
cellular metabolism. It may be this increased demand for amino
acids in tumor cells that underlies the effects of CHR-2797 and
bestatin shown here. HL-60 cells do not increase expression of
amino acid transporters, such as LAT1 (SLC7A5), in response to
CHR-2797, although other transporters are up-regulated. Decreased
amino acid supply, through inhibition of cellular protein recycling
by CHR-2797, coupled with an inability to further up-regulate
transporters, such as LAT1, may be sufficient, in cell types such as
HL-60, to cause fatal nutrient stress, perhaps by imbalancing levels
of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins such as NOXA and
MCL1. The current data echo findings reported recently with the
natural product brasilicardin A, an immunosuppressive and
antitumor agent, which is a specific inhibitor of the amino acid
transport system L, of which LAT1 is a part (49, 50). This agent
stimulates GCN2 activation and, subsequently, eIF2a phosphorylation in lymphocytes. The potential for synergy between CHR-2797
and agents targeting amino acid transporters is an obvious avenue
to be explored.
Further work to establish details of the mechanism of action of
CHR-2797 and its selectivity for certain types of tumor cells and to
identify biomarkers that may predict a clinical response to the drug
is under way. Phase II clinical studies in a number of human cancer
types continue.
