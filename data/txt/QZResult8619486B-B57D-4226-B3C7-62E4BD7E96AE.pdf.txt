BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to assess clinical outcome and the role of proton therapy for local control
of osteosarcoma (OSA). METHODS: All patients who received proton therapy or mixed photon-proton radiotherapy
from 1983 to 2009 at the Massachusetts General Hospital were reviewed. Criteria for proton therapy were the need
for high dose in the context of highly conformal radiotherapy of unresected or partially resected OSA, positive postoperative margins, postoperative imaging studies with macroscopic disease, or incomplete resection as defined by
the surgeon. The primary endpoint was local control of the site treated; secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), long-term toxicity, and prognostic factors associated with clinical outcome.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with a median age of 29 years (range, 2-76 years) were offered proton therapy. The
mean dose was 68.4 gray (Gy; standard deviation, 5.4 Gy). Of the total dose, 58.2% (range, 11%-100%) was delivered
with protons. Local control after 3 and 5 years was 82% and 72%, respectively. The distant failure rate was 26% after
3 and 5 years. The 5-year DFS was 65%, and the 5-year OS was 67%. The extent of surgical resection did not correlate
with outcome. Risk factors for local failure were 2 grade disease (P < .0001) and total treatment length (P ¼ .008).
Grade 3 to 4 late toxicity was seen in 30.1 % of patients. One patient died from treatment-associated acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 1 from secondary carcinoma of the maxilla. CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy to deliver high radiotherapy doses allows locally curative treatment for some patients with unresectable or incompletely resected OSA.

Osteosarcoma (OSA) is a disease typically of young patients, with a peak incidence in the second decade; when
arising in adults, the highest incidence appears after the age of 55 years. In the young, OSA generally presents as an
osteoid-forming tumor around the epiphyses of the long bones. Besides local destruction, metastatic dissemination to the
lungs or other bones can also occur. As chemotherapy is highly active and the risk for metastatic disease is high, treatment
generally starts with induction chemotherapy as soon as pathologic diagnosis has been confirmed. Anthracyclines and cisplatin, as well as methotrexate or ifosfamide, form the backbone of systemic treatments.1 After chemotherapy induction,
complete surgical resection generally yields high rates of local control in patients with extremity lesions. Chemoresponsiveness can be assessed after resection, and the degree of chemotherapy-induced necrosis carries important prognostic information.2 Postoperative chemotherapy usually continues for nearly a year.
Local tumor control, an important component of successful treatment, may be improved in selected patients with
external beam radiation, although the potential of radiotherapy (RT) as an integral therapeutic component for local curative
treatment has been debated.3,4 Depending on the clinical presentation, function-sparing surgery might be difficult to
achieve in certain anatomical sites, such as the head, the spine, and the pelvis. Furthermore, OSA has been traditionally
viewed as a neoplasm that responds poorly to radiation,5 and current knowledge about the role of high-dose RT in the setting of nonresectable or marginally resectable OSA has remained limited. Overall survival can be expected in 70% of cases
with modern chemotherapy and surgery with anticipated local control in 90% of extremity osteosarcomas. Overall

survival and local control, however, have been significantly
worse for craniofacial, spine, and pelvic tumors.6,7,8,17 The
Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group used photonbased RT in a minority of their trial patients; in the case of
unresectable disease they used doses of 30 to 56 gray (Gy)
for disease of the spine, and 56 to 68 Gy for OSA of the pelvis, resulting in local control rates of <20%.7,8 Conversely,
Machak et al reported local control rates of 60% with photon RT for nonresected OSA in 31 patients with doses of 60
Gy (given in 2.5-3 Gy daily or 1.25-1.5 Gy twice daily fractions), and patients who responded to chemotherapy had
even higher rates of response.9 A previous report from the
Massachusetts General Hospital on 41 patients reported
high-dose RT resulting in local control rates between 50%
and 80%, depending of the extent of surgical resection.10
Thus, the current use of RT for OSA follows the concept
that high doses of ionizing radiation may add to local control, as has been the case in the treatment of sarcomas in general, when wide surgical margins cannot be achieved.10,11
The current experience with proton therapy for
OSA remains limited. Most of the studies reporting on
particle therapy include a variety of histological entities,
of which OSA mostly represents the minority, limiting
interpretation.11,12 Thus, it has remained unclear in what
context particle therapy should be incorporated a priori in
the curative treatment of OSA not amendable to complete
surgical resection. Currently, the best data have been
reported from Chiba, Japan, using heavy ion-based particle treatment. They reported a local control rate after 5
years of 65%, with an overall survival rate of 29% in 58
patients with OSA of the trunk treated with carbon ions
from 1994 until 2007 at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences.13
A reassessment of the role of particle treatment in
the multimodality approach to OSA is of growing clinical
importance, as access to particle treatment facilities is
increasing worldwide. Although the clinical benefits of
this costly and complex technology are still being assessed
and debated, the reduction in integral radiation dose is
likely to be of most importance to the young patient with
a large tumor such as patients with pelvic disease.14,15
Here we review the entire series of OSA patients at Massachusetts General Hospital who were treated with proton
therapy for OSA.

Characteristics of 55 patients treated with proton therapy are shown. All
patients were offered proton therapy with the aim of achieving long-term local
control of osteosarcoma. Therefore, the 4 cases treated to or treated with metastatic disease at the time of treatment were retained in the analysis.

who were treated for OSA with proton therapy. Approval
from the investigational review board was obtained to analyze long-term outcome in these patients. All available
department and hospital charts and records were reviewed
to assess local control as the primary endpoint, as well as
secondary endpoints of disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and long-term toxicity.
Patient Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the cohort. The
median age was 29 years (range, 2 to 76 years), and the
mean age was 32 years (standard deviation, 18). The male
to female ratio was 5:6. The median follow-up was 27
months (range, 0-196 months). The distribution of disease manifestations is shown in Figure 1. Histology was
available for all patients, and histological subtype was
osteoblastic in 29 (52.7%) patients, chondroblastic in 21
(38.2%), OSA with giant cells in 2 (3.6%), fibroblastic in

2 (3.6%), and myxoid in 1 (1.8%). Grade 1 disease was
seen in 12 (22%) patients, grade 2 in 23 (41.2%) patients,
and grade 3 in 20 (36%) patients. This grade distribution
may be more favorable than in some series, perhaps
because the patient population is slightly older, likely reflective of the anatomic distribution with more craniofacial lesions, rather than the more common population of
adolescents with high-grade extremity lesions. American
Joint Committee on Cancer stage IA disease was noted in
3 (5.5%) patients, stage IB in 9 (16.4%) patients, stage
IIA in 24 (43.6%) patients, stage IIB in 14 (25.5%)
patients, and stage IV in 5 (7.3%) patients. In 23 (41.8%)
patients, surgery consisted of biopsy only or minor resection with residual gross tumor. Positive surgical margins
were present in 27 (49.1%) patients and surgeon’s notes
indicating residual disease in 5 (9.1%) patients.

Radiotherapy
The initial fields were designed to cover the preoperative
clinical tumor. All cases were treated after computed tomography (CT)-based 3-dimensional (3D) planning, and
proton therapy was delivered with 160 MV protons via a
fixed beam line before 2001 and with 230 MV protons via
a rotational gantry after 2001. RT consisted of daily external beam using either protons or a combination of protons
and photons, except for 3 cases where hyperfractionation
was used (1 in 1994, 1 in 1998, and 1 in 2001). The total
dose was selected based on the patient’s condition, anatomic localization of the disease, the extent of prior surgery and degree of resection, grading characteristics, and
normal critical structures in close proximity to the target
volumes. Doses of <60 Gy were given to only 5 (9.1%)
patients. One patient had a resected OSA of the third lumbar vertebral body at the age of 37 years and received an
adjuvant dose of 50.4 Gy with protons only, 1 patient at
the age of 14 years received 57.6 Gy for incompletely
resected disease at the lumbosacral junction, 1 patient at
the age of 19 years was treated with 59.4 Gy for positive
margins for disease of the distal femur, 1 patient at the age
of 51 years received 54.6 Gy for resected disease of the
fourth and fifth thoracic vertebral bodies, and 1 patient at
age 25 received 58 Gy after microscopically incomplete
resection of OSA of the maxilla. Twenty-two (40%)
patients received a dose between 60 Gy and 70 Gy, and 28
(50.1%) patients received a total dose of 70 Gy.
The total dose was applied with protons only in 11
(20%) patients, and 7 (63.6%) of these patients presented
with OSA of the bones of the head. Greater than 50% of
the total dose was delivered with protons in 31% of the
patients. Less than 30% of the total dose was applied with
protons in 9 (16.4%) patients. These 9 patients had disease of either the spine, sacrum, pelvis, or femur.
Preoperative RT was used in a total of 7 (13%)
patients with a dose of 19.8 Gy, except in 1 case, a dose of
50.4 Gy was used for disease of the spine. The rationale
for delivering a portion of the dose before surgery is to
minimize the risk of intraoperative tumor cell seeding.
Postoperative radiation was started as soon as patients
recovered from surgery to minimize overall treatment time.
Unplanned treatment breaks were given at the discretion of
the treating physician for severe acute mucositis, dermatitis,
febrile neutropenia, or other acute radiation-related toxicity. Intraoperative treatment with electrons (6 MV) was
used in 2 patients with doses of 7.5 to 15 Gy, and in 1
patient, radioactive 90Y plaques were used to deliver a dose
to the dura adjacent to disease invading the spinal canal.

The median volume treated to the maximal dose
(boost dose) covering the gross tumor volume or the highest risk area for relapse in the tumor bed in the patients
without residual macroscopic tumor as observed on the
treatment planning CT was 82.0 mL (range, 8-1090 mL;
mean, 194.2 mL), and for the volumes covering the initial
clinical target volume, which also included areas at risk for
subclinical disease beyond the original gross tumor, was
213.0 mL (range, 14-1624 mL; mean, 380 mL). Four
patients had only 1 tumor target volume after microscopically incomplete resection: 1 case of OSA of the maxilla, 1 in
the mastoid bone, 1 in the second cervical vertebra, and 1 in
the sacrum; all 4 were treated with doses of 67 to 68 Gy.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy was delivered neoadjuvantly in 48 (87%)
patients and consisted of anthracyclines in combination
with cisplatin, and/or high-dose methotrexate. In the case
of undesired side effects or failure to respond, treatment
was switched to ifosfamide with etoposide. Ifosfamide was
administered during RT in 38 (69%) of the patients, in
combination with etoposide (65%), including some
recent patients with unresected OSA, or methotrexate
(4% of patients). After RT, adjuvant chemotherapy was
given in 75% of cases, whereas unknown chemotherapy
status after surgery was scored in 6 (11%) patients. Chemotherapy was scored as full intensive standard chemotherapy of intensity defined by the number of cycles and the
drugs and drug combinations used. All others were scored
as ‘‘some chemotherapy.’’
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (release
11.0, 2009; StataCorp, College Station, Tex). Statistical
significance of various risk factors for primary and secondary endpoints was assessed using competing risks regression methodology. Death was considered a competing
event to local and distant failure. P values of <.05 were
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Local Control
Twelve patients suffered from local treatment failure (Fig. 2
Top). Disease progression within 2 months after RT was
observed in 4 patients, and 3 patients suffered from local
relapse >3 years after RT. At 3 and 5 years, the local control rate was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68%90%) and 72% (95% CI, 52%-84%), respectively. No

local relapse was seen in grade 1 disease (P < .0001). Prolonged treatment time was a risk factor for local failure,
with a hazard ratio of 1.02 (95% CI, 1.01-1.03;
P ¼ .008). An indication of increased risk for local failure,
with a hazard ratio of 2.6 (95% CI, 0.8-9.0; P ¼ .1) was
observed for patients with disease of the skull, as compared with other anatomical sites. Figure 3 illustrates the
difference of local control over time in patients with disease in the cranium versus other sites (P ¼ .09). Primary
presentation or presentation at relapse did not discriminate for successful local control, as 16 (29.1%) patients
presented with local recurrence after prior resection, and
another 2 were treated at metastatic sites after successful
prior therapy targeting the primary site.
With regard to the pattern of failure, 10 patients
failed within the radiation treatment field. Of these, 8
patients had OSA of the bones of the skull. The other 2
cases were 1 patient with extensive disease from the distal
cervical spine to the midthoracic spine and another

Original Article

patient with extensive sacral disease spanning S1 to S4.
Marginal misses were likely in 2 cases. One patient with
disease of the thoracic spine showed disease progression in
the vertebral body growing from the irradiated high-

dose volume into the contralateral part of the vertebral
body and beyond it. Another patient with pelvic disease
involving the ileum showed distal disease progression,
and retrospectively, a caudal marginal miss cannot be
excluded. Treatment volumes or the absence of surgery
did not correlate with local treatment failure (P ¼ .5).
The fraction of dose delivered with protons or photons
was not associated with local disease control or disease
progression.
The extent of surgery, however, did impact on local
control probability when conducting a meta-analysis of
published data based on Table 2, illustrated in Figure 4.
Patients who received lower radiation doses seemed to
achieve higher local control when combined with surgery,
but interestingly the impact on surgery was no longer evident when high-dose radiation was applied.
Distant Metastasis
A total of 11 patients suffered from distant failure (Fig. 2
Bottom). Four of the 12 patients with local failure also suffered from distant failure 0 to 7 months after RT. Ten of
the 11 patients with distant failure had grade 2 or higher
disease but the difference was not statistically significant
(P ¼ .2).

Figure 3. (Top) Local and (Bottom) distant failure of osteosarcoma of the cranium compared with osteosarcoma of
other anatomical sites is shown.

Role of Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy was used in most patients. However, the
quality of chemotherapy was reviewed, and intensive
chemotherapy as defined by the drugs used (anthracyclines and cisplatin alternating with methotrexate) and
documentation of the number of cycles given revealed
that highly intensive state-of-the art treatment was delivered to only 19 patients. Of these 19, 2 (10.5%) patients

suffered local failure, and 5 (26.3%) failed distantly. Of
the 31 patients receiving nonintensive chemotherapy, 10
(32.3%) patients failed locally, and 6 (19.4%) patients
showed metastatic disease progression. The differences
with respect to chemotherapy intensity were not significant, although adherence to standard high-intensity
chemotherapy did weakly associate with successful local
treatment control in univariate analysis (hazard ratio, 5.9;
95% CI, 0.75-46.5; P ¼ .09), but not in multivariate
analysis. None of the 5 patients treated without chemotherapy, 3 with grade 1 disease, and 2 with grade 2 disease
showed either local or distant failure.
DFS and Overall Survival
DFS was 68% (95% CI, 53%-80%) at 2 years and 65%
(95% CI, 49%-77%) at 5 years (Fig. 5 Top). The overall
survival rate at 2 years was 84% (95% CI, 69%-92%),
and 67% (95% CI, 47%-80%) at 5 years (Fig. 5 Bottom).
Four patients died without disease, 2 of therapy-related
mortality, 1 at the age of 16 years (1.5 years after completion of treatment) because of acute lymphocytic leukemia,
and another patient died 15 years after completion of
treatment for OSA from squamous carcinoma of the maxilla. Two patients died to noncancer-related disease 65
and 96 months after the end of RT.
Treatment-Associated Toxicity
Nine patients did not have any significant late treatmentassociated toxicity, and were treated to the mastoid (n ¼
1), maxillary bone (n ¼ 1), cervical spine (n ¼ 3), thoracic
spine (n ¼ 2), lumbosacral bones (n ¼ 1), and hip (n ¼ 1).

Grade 1 toxicity was reported in 12 patients, receiving
treatment targeting the cranium (n ¼ 4), cervical spine (n
¼ 1), chest wall (n ¼ 1), thoracic spine (n ¼ 2), lumbosacral sites (n ¼ 3), and distal femur (n ¼ 1). Grade 2 toxicity,
as defined by pain controlled with nonopioid medication
and minor complaints interfering with the activities of
daily living, were reported in 12 patients, consisting of
pain, paresthesia, atrophy (1 patient with cervical spine
OSA), ineffective gait and foot drop, radiation myelopathy, and distal neuropathy. Complaints were possibly
caused by radiation alone in 3 patients, whereas most cases
of neuronal dysfunction were either pre-existing or possibly related to surgery. Grade 3 and 4 toxicity was recorded
in 17 patients. Grade 3 toxicity consisted of severe pain
requiring morphine-based medication (n ¼ 3), cranial
nerve damage with diplopia (n ¼ 1), immobility of limb
(n ¼ 2), severe bowel dysfunction with distal functional
obstruction because of denervation (n ¼ 1), and severe
headaches (n ¼ 1). Grade 4 toxicity was defined by loss of

organ or complete loss of organ function and was reported
in 9 patients. In 4 patients, the eye had to be removed after
RT, 1 patient suffered from ipsilateral loss of vision and orbital pain, and 1 patient suffered from ipsilateral hearing
loss and blindness. Two patients were severely handicapped because of immobility or impairment of gait. One
patient suffered from extensive structural alteration of the
maxillary bone needing repeated adaptation of the prosthesis. Two patients died from treatment-related illnesses;
1 patient developed acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 year
and a half after successful treatment of OSA, and the other
patient died from a secondary squamous cell carcinoma of
the maxilla almost 16 years after successful treatment of
the OSA with protons and chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
The present series reviews the experience with proton
therapy for local control of incompletely or unresected
OSA at Massachusetts General Hospital since 1983. In a
prior series from the Massachusetts General Hospital
spanning from 1980 to 2002, the role of RT in 41 cases of
OSA was analyzed. Only 56% of the patients in that series
received proton therapy as a part of their treatment. Additional differences from the prior cohort exist: 1) the median dose in the present series was 68.4 Gy compared with
66 Gy in the earlier cohort; 2) no patient received doses
<50.4 Gy compared with 10% patients in the former
cohort who received 30 Gy, and some received <50 Gy;
and 3) chemotherapy was given to 91% of patients compared with 85% in the previous cohort. Despite the finding that 22 (40%) patients from the previous analysis
were retained in the present series, the results differ significantly. The differences regarding treatment modalities,
the doses applied, and the time frame analyzed allow us to
more fully explore the role of proton therapy for OSA.
Because patients in this series received high radiation
doses, radiation treatment dose per se did not emerge as a
significant factor for local control in the present series,
and the lack of radical resection did not seem to be detrimental. The reason for this finding may be related to the
overall higher mean radiation dose applied in the current
series. Proton therapy generally allows more conformal
dose application than 3D conformal photons and lower
integral doses than either 3D conformal photons or intensity-modulated RT. Treating in high-dose ranges may
reduce the importance of the extent of surgery, as illustrated with data derived from reports with photons or particle treatment in Figure 4.

4528

High control rates with particle treatment without
prior surgical resection have been reported by Kamada
et al, based on their analysis of unresected OSA patients
treated with carbon ions at the National Institute for
Radiological Sciences in Chiba, Japan.13 Table 2 summarizes the current literature in respect to local control and
complete surgical resection status. It is noteworthy that
the results from particle-based RTs yield high control
rates exceeding 70%, which are seemingly superior to the
results obtained with conventional RT. Such findings are
not surprising, as charged particle treatment is generally
associated with the feasibility to deliver higher doses. The
lack of association of the extent of surgery with local control in the present series, besides being possibly the result
of lack of statistical power, is particularly interesting in
reference to the local control data obtained with carbon
ions.13 Furthermore, conventional fraction schedules as
used for proton therapy in the vast majority of cases in the
present series compare favorably with the hypofractionated schedules using 16 fractions over 4 weeks to deliver
64 to 70.4 Gy with carbon ions.16 Figure 4 illustrates the
relation between dose and local tumor control rates as
reported in the literature in Table 2. The optimal combined approach of surgical resection with RT when proton or carbon ion therapy is available must consider the
relative long-term toxicities of the different approaches,
especially for disease of the axial skeleton or pelvis.
Another important finding in the present series is
the association of lower local control in patients with disease of the skull. This finding has not been anticipated
because of prior experience at the Massachusetts General
Hospital.10 However, data from the literature have
reflected control rates <50% in small series,17,18 and several hypotheses may explain why proton therapy might
have reduced efficacy in the head and neck region. First,
the use of induction chemotherapy in patients with OSA
in the head has not been uniformly applied. Some patients
may require immediate surgery, because disease close to
critical structures may mandate immediate surgical
decompression.19 Resection, however, is rarely complete
because of invasion and spatial relation to critical structures.
Another consideration, especially in the maxillary bone and
bones close to the ethmoid cavities, is that air-tissue inhomogeneities might affect the accuracy of dose delivery, as
noted for other situations when treating areas with air cavities with proton therapy such as in the chest.20 Dose constraints placed on critical structures in close proximity to
the tumor, however, are likely the predominant contributing factor. The present finding that the head and neck

Cancer

region may still be a risk factor for local relapse may be of
clinical importance.
Chemotherapy in the present series was marginally
associated with better local control. However, in the present series considerable uncertainties about chemotherapy
delivered after RT persist, because documentation of
treatment after RT and during follow-up was incomplete
in some cases as this was often given at outside institutions. The importance of optimal chemotherapy has been
clearly defined in the pediatric population with OSAs,
and the possible association with improved local control is
supported by the present series. During RT, chemotherapy with ifosfamide  etoposide is frequently used at the
Massachusetts General Hospital as these agents have both
systemic and radiosensitizing activity and have also been
successfully combined with radiotherapy for the management of Ewing’s sarcomas.
The present cohort analysis highlights an important general consideration with regard to many rare disease entities such as incompletely resected OSA. The
difficulty of conducting randomized controlled trials
presents challenges in the prospective assessment of
novel medical and technical innovations once they are
introduced into the clinic.6,15 Controlled registries or
databases collecting data from multiple institutions
could facilitate the assessment and implementation of
novel technologies and agents in these rare medical conditions. These approaches should be considered as more
particle treatment facilities come online and permit the
collaborative evaluation of this technology when used
for uncommon diseases such as unresectable or incompletely resected OSA.
In summary, particle-based RT can be effective for
local control of OSA in areas where radical resection is
problematic because of the impossibility of complete
resection or potential morbidity of surgery. Proton therapy is especially suitable for young patients with OSA, in
whom reductions in the integral dose to nontarget tissue
is important to minimize the risk to normal tissue development and of secondary malignancies.21 Even with the
use of conformal 3D proton therapy, some patients in this
series experienced significant radiation-related toxicity.
There may be the possibility of some reduction in this toxicity as well as further improvements with the future
implementation of intensity-modulated proton therapy,
which will better restrict the prescribed dose to the target
than 3D conformal protons, as well as reduce normal
tissue dose that is in the beam trajectory proximal to
the tumor target.22,23 Optimal coordination of surgery,

chemotherapy, new targeted agents, and particle-based
RT is likely to result in the best local control rates while
minimizing toxicity; the best sequencing and integration
of multimodality approaches, however, remain to be further defined.24
