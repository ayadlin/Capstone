BACKGROUND. S-1 is a promising oral fluoropyrimidine. The authors obtained
extended Phase II safety and efficacy data in a multicenter setting for the S-1 plus
cisplatin combination: The experimental arm of the global Phase III First-Line
Advanced Gastric Cancer Study (FLAGS) is being compared with 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin.

METHODS. Eligible patients had untreated, histologically confirmed advanced gastric
cancer (AGC), a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) 70%, adequate organ function, and provided written consent. Patients received S-1 (25 mg/m2 twice daily on
Days 1 through 21) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on Day 1) every 28 days. The confirmed
overall response rate (CORR) also was designated by an external review. The time to
progression (TTP), median survival (MS), and safety were assessed.

RESULTS. All 72 patients were assessed for safety and survival, and 64 patients were
assessed for CORR. The median KPS was 90%. The median number of treatment cycles
was 4. The CORR was 55% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 42–67%). The median duration of response was >5 months. At 6 months, only an estimated 38% of patients had
cancer progression. The estimated MS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.6–12.9 months). At
least 1 serious adverse event occurred in 44% of patients. The frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicities (using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria), which occurred
in >10% of patients, included fatigue/asthenia (24%), emesis (17%), nausea (15%), diarrhea (13%), and neutropenia (19%). Complicated neutropenia (1.4%) and grade 4 di-

espite its declining incidence globally, gastric
cancer is a serious health problem in several
regions of the world with approximately 930,000 new
cases diagnosed each year.1 It often is diagnosed in
late stages except in Japan and Korea, where early
detection is performed routinely. Once it becomes
metastatic, gastric cancer is incurable, and chemotherapy is palliative. Despite the identification of a
number of new classes of active agents, the median
survival often is 9 months. The frequency of serious
adverse events during currently used regimens is
high and remains a concern. The emphasis on the
need to develop therapies that would result in significant prolongation of survival but with a favorable
safety profile is timely.
S-1, which is a fourth-generation oral fluoropyrimidine, is an oral formulation of tegafur (FT), 5chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP), and potassium
oxonate (OXO) at a molar ratio of 1:0.4:12 (Fig. 1). FT
is the prodrug for cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
and CDHP prevents its degradation. In animal models, OXO is protective against FT-induced diarrhea.3,4

The diarrheagenic property of 5-FU is because of its
phosphorylation in the intestine, primarily by orotate
phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT). OXO is a specific
inhibitor of OPRT. Thus, the protective effect of OXO
is caused by its ability to reduce phosphorylation of
5-FU; however, 5-FU also can be phosphorylated by
uridine phosphorylase or thymidine phosphorylase,
generating 5-fluoro-20 -deoxyuridine-50 -monophosphate
and, thus, resulting in diarrhea. CDHP is a potent
and competitive inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and results in higher concentrations of 5-FU.5 Pharmacokinetic studies of S-1 have
demonstrated substantial prolongation of the halflife of 5-FU.6 Because FT is metabolized differently
in Asians and whites on account of polymorphic differences in the CYP2A6 gene, a Phase I pharmacokinetic study in Western patients determined that the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of S-1 was 25 mg/
m2 twice daily (on Days 1 through 21) and that the
MTD of cisplatin was 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each
28-day cycle.7 Fluoropyrimidines remain the most
extensively incorporated agents in the treatment of

S-1 and Cisplatin in AGC/Lenz et al.

patients with gastroesophageal cancer. Effective oral
fluoropyrimidines are highly desirable. S-1 falls into
the DPD-inhibiting fluoropyrimidines (DIF) category.
Currently available capecitabine, is a non-DIF compound. Capecitabine, which is a third-generation
fluoropyrimidine, has activity against advanced gastroesophageal cancers8 and has been identified as
not inferior to 5-FU, which means that it is a reasonable substitute for intravenous 5-FU.9
In that respect, S-1 has entered a rapid development track in the West. After defining the MTD, a
multicenter efficacy trial that met its primary endpoint of achieving a confirmed overall response rate
(CORR) of 45% has been reported with a favorable
safety profile.10 Once the initial Phase II study results
were reviewed, a global Phase III trial called the
First-Line Advanced Gastric Cancer Study (FLAGS)
was conceived. In FLAGS, S-1 plus cisplatin is the experimental arm, and 5-FU plus cisplatin is the reference arm. However, Because the Western experience
with S-1 plus cisplatin had been quite limited, it was
decided that additional safety and efficacy data
should be generated. Thus, the accrual was increased
from an initial 47 patients to the final 72 patients in
the multicenter setting to gain more experience. In
this article, we also are able to relate the strengths
and weaknesses of conducting an elaborate external
review, noting that both parties (the investigators
and external reviewers) have access to the same set
of objective imaging data, but the investigators make
their decisions in real time in the clinics (by using
many forms of objective and subjective data), and
the external reviewers make their decisions much
later based only on the objective data.
Here, we report the safety and efficacy data from
the extended Phase II population of patients with
untreated, advanced gastric cancer who received S-1
plus cisplatin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
All patients with advanced, unresectable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or
gastroesophageal junction were eligible provided
they were aged 18 years or older and had a Karnofsky
performance status (KPS) 70%, a life expectancy
12 weeks, an absolute granulocyte count 1500/mL,
a platelet count 100,000/mL, a hemoglobin level
9.0 g/dL, a serum bilirubin level 1.5 times the
upper limit of normal (ULN), and a normal creatinine level. Patients also were required to have transaminase levels 2.5 times the ULN (5 times the
ULN in patients with liver metastases). The presence

35

of measurable cancer was required and was determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Only patients who could
swallow tablets were eligible. Prior chemotherapy for
advanced cancer was not allowed. Patients who
received adjuvant therapy were eligible provided >6
months had elapsed between the end of adjuvant
therapy and registration on this study. All patients
were told to practice effective contraception. An
approved written informed consent was required.
Patients were excluded if they had brain metastases,
if they had severe comorbid conditions, or if they
lacked the ability to comply with the requirements of
the protocol. Patients who were receiving drugs with
potential interactions with S-1 (flucytosine, allopurinol, and phenytoin) were excluded.

Pretreatment Evaluations
The baseline evaluations included a history and
complete physical examination, urine pregnancy test
(women), KPS determination, complete blood count,
serum chemistries and electrolytes, urinalysis, chest
X-ray, and recording of concomitant medications. In
addition to these evaluations, imaging studies (computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) were obtained.

Chemotherapy
Patients received S-1 at a dose of 25 mg/m2 orally
twice daily (50 mg/m2 per day) on Days 1 through 21
followed by a 7-day recovery period. S-1 was administered at least 1 hour before or after a meal. Compliance and drug accountability were scrutinized
thoroughly by asking patients to keep a daily diary
that tracked S-1 and all other medications.
Patients received cisplatin intravenously over
2 hours at 75 mg/m2 on Day 1. Standard premedications and hydration were administered. Cycles were
repeated every 28 days.
In patients who had limiting toxicity from cisplatin and had to discontinue it (eg, creatinine elevations or neuropathy), S-1 could be continued as a
single agent. Chemotherapy was continued until
there was evidence of progression, consent withdrawal, or the development of unacceptable toxicity in
the investigator’s opinion.

Evaluation During Therapy
Complete blood counts and serum chemistries were
monitored weekly during therapy. Response to therapy
was assessed after the first cycle of the combination.

CANCER January 1, 2007 / Volume 109 / Number 1

Response and Toxicity Criteria
RECIST criteria were used to assess the type of
response, and the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0) were used to assess toxicity (available at URL: www.cancer.gov/ Accessed
March 10, 2006).
Response was evaluated after the first cycle and
again after the second cycle to confirm a response if
the measurements suggested a partial or complete
response. Thereafter, the evaluations were performed
every 2 cycles. Radiographs of all evaluable patients
also were reviewed externally to confirm investigatordesignated responses.
Dose Modifications
Because this study involved 2 agents, dose adjustments were made for each agent if a distinction in
toxicity could be made. If it was believed that both
agents were causing the toxicity, then a dose reduction was performed for both. S-1 dose modification
was to be made in 2 ways: during a 4-week cycle and
at the initiation of subsequent cycles. In patients
who had a related episode of grade 3 or 4 toxicity
during therapy, S-1 was held and was resumed at a
reduced dose (5 mg/m2 per dose) when toxicity
resolved, and the reduce dose was used for subsequent cycles. Cisplatin also was reduced by 25% for
the subsequent cycle in patients who had a related
episode of grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Drug doses never
were increased.
Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the
overall response rate (ORR). An ORR of 45% was considered valuable enough to pursue the 2-drug combination in a Phase III trial. Simon’s optimum 2-stage
design was used.11 The first stage required 6 of 17
patients to have a confirmed partial or complete
response assuming P1 ¼ .45, P0 ¼ .25 with a ¼ .05,
and b ¼ .2 before proceeding to the second stage (P1
is the highest response rate and P2 is the lowest acceptable response rate). In the second stage, 24 evaluable patients could be added; and, if 15 patients
achieved a confirmed objective response, then the
primary endpoint would have been met.
With the above stipulations, there were 41 evaluable patients among the first 47 patients, and the primary objective of achieving a 45% response rate was
met.10 Because the experience with S-1 plus cisplatin
had been quite limited, we decided to expand the
Phase II population from 47 patients to 72 patients
to gain additional safety and efficacy data. To
improve the rigor in reporting of efficacy data, we
also decided that all CORR, response durations, and

RESULTS
Patient Population
In total, 72 patients were recruited: All 72 patients
were evaluated for safety and median survival calculations, and 64 patients were assessed for efficacy
endpoints (CORR, TTP, and response duration). The
majority of patients (74%) were white, and 15% of
patients were black and Latino. Eligible patients were
defined as those who received at least 2 cycles of
chemotherapy and had at least 1 subsequent tumor
assessment. Patients also were considered evaluable
if there was evidence of rapid progression of cancer.
Eight patients were not evaluable for efficacy endpoints. We previously described the reasons for
ineligibility in 6 of those 8 patients10: Briefly, 1

cycle, an investigator inadvertently stopped therapy
in 1 patient, 1 responding patient required drainage
of an abdominal abscess after 1 cycle (and never
resumed therapy), 1 patient withdrew consent after 1
cycle, and there was 1 treatment-related death before
a patient completed the first cycle. In the expanded
population (with an additional 25 consecutive patients), 2 patients were not assessable, including a
patient who died of an unrelated cardiovascular
arrest on Day 16 of Cycle 1 and, in the other patient,
the investigator stopped therapy on Day 8 of Cycle 1.
Neither of those 2 patients had a postbaseline response assessment. Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1. In this predominantly male (67%)
population, the gastroesophageal junction was involved in 37 patients (51%), the median KPS was
90%, and the majority of patients had 2 sites of
metastases. The median age was 56 years, liver metastases were present in 26% of patients, and lymph
node metastases were present in 56% of patients.

Antitumor Activity
A median of 4 cycles per patient was administered
(range, 1 cycle–16 cycles). Pertinent radiographs of all
patients were reviewed independently. Below, we
report CORR, TTP, and response duration as judged by
the investigators and by the external reviewers. In this

exercise, it was noted that the number of target lesions
assessed and the number of censored individuals was
different by 2 reviews. This alone may have accounted
for the differences reported. However, it was encouraging that the CORR was the same according to both
groups. The median time to the first evidence of objective response was 1 month (range, 1 month–4 months).
Details are presented in Table 2.

Overall survival was calculated for all 72 patients,
and the estimated median survival was 10.4 months
(95% CI, 8.6–12.9 months) (Fig. 4). The estimated 1year survival rate was 42%, and the estimated 2-year
survival rate was 21%. The median follow-up for the

(63%) were censored for the assessment of TTP. The
CORR was 55% (95% confidence interval [95% CI],
42–67%). The median response duration was 10.3
months (95% CI, 5.3 months to not reached), and, at
8 months, 62% of patients still were responding to
therapy (Fig. 2). Nineteen patients (30%) had stable
disease and 8 patients (13%) had progressive disease
as their best overall response. The median TTP,
which was assessed in 64 evaluable patients, was
11.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 months to not reached)
(Fig. 3). At 6 months, only 38% of patients had progressive disease, and, at 8 months, 48% of patients
had progressive disease.

Investigator assessments
The median number of target lesions assessed was 2.
Twelve patients (34%) were censored for the assessment of response duration, and 19 patients (30%)
were censored for the assessment of TTP. The CORR
was 55% (95% CI, 42–67%). The median response duration was 5.4 months (range, 4.4 months–7.2

Safety
In total, 332 cycles were administered to 72 patients,
and the median duration of each chemotherapy cycle
was 30.5 days. The median number of cycles administered was 4 (range, 1 cycle–16 cycles). The cisplatin dose was decreased or discontinued in 28% of
patients, and the S-1 dose was decreased in 18% of
patients. Of the 8 patients who discontinued cisplatin
while continuing S-1 alone, the median number of
cisplatin cycles was 4, and the median number of S1 cycles after permanent discontinuation of cisplatin
was 2.5.
All 72 patients were assessed for safety. One
patient with a body surface area of 2.34/m2 who
received a daily S-1 dose of 120 mg developed grade
5 diarrhea and neutropenia and died before the end
of the first cycle (treatment-related death). Hematologic adverse events that possibly, most likely, or
definitely were related to study medications are listed
in Table 3. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was recorded
in 19% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 anemia (6%) and
thrombocytopenia (1.4%) were not common. Nonhematologic adverse events that possibly, most likely,
or definitely were related to study medications are
shown in Table 4. Among the grade 3 or 4 toxicities,
the most frequent were fatigue/asthenia (24%),
emesis (17%), nausea (15%), and diarrhea (13%). All
other events were recorded in <10% of patients. It is
noteworthy that febrile neutropenia occurred in 1.4%
of patients, grade 3 or 4 stomatitis occurred in 1.4%

DISCUSSION
Compared with studies for other common gastrointestinal cancers, the performance of timely Phase III
studies or even multicenter Phase II studies has been
lagging for gastric cancer. However, the momentum
may be building slowly, and at least 2 Phase III studies have been reported recently.12,13 Focus has
increased on oral chemotherapy agents, such as
capecitabine and S-1. Accrual of approximately 1000
patients to a large Phase III trial (REAL-2) examining
the contributions of oxaliplatin and capecitabine has
been completed, and the final results are awaited.
FLAGS, which set out to accrue approximately 1050
patients, was initiated in May 2005, had accrued 800
patients by the end of April 2006, and is estimated to
complete its accrual by October 2006.
The interest in S-1 is considerable. It differs from
the previous generation of agents, such as tegafururacil or capecitabine, in which the advancement
has been combining a prodrug with a second chemical that potentially may make the cytotoxic agent
more effective. S-1 is unique and represents both a
conceptual advance and a technologic advance, not
because it contains a cytotoxic prodrug (ftorafur) and
a potent DPD inhibitor (CDHP) but because it incorporates a specific chemical (oxonic acid) that, at
least in the preclinical setting, prevented diarrhea
and may lessen toxicity. It is hoped that this concept
can be incorporated into future drug development.

S-1 has entered a rapid development path in the
West. Upon completion of a Phase I pharmacokinetic
study of S-1 plus cisplatin,7 the initial Phase II study
was completed.8 The primary endpoint of the Phase
II study was to establish a CORR of 45% in patients
with untreated advanced gastric cancer. Using a 2step statistical design, 41 evaluable patients were
among the first 47 patients enrolled. The CORR
among those patients was 51% (95% CI, 35% to
67%), their median survival was 10.9 months, grade 3
or 4 toxicity was infrequent, and there was 1 treatment-related death (2%). The primary endpoint was
achieved, and the safety profile was favorable, providing sufficient encouragement to proceed with the
development of FLAGS. However, it also was clear
that the Phase II experience with S-1 plus cisplatin
was quite limited in the West, where FLAGS would
be accruing patients, and additional safety information would be highly desirable. We decided to accrue
more patients to gain additional safety data.
Our data on 72 patients (53% more patients than
the initial 47 patients) confirmed that the safety profile of S-1 plus cisplatin in a predominantly Western
population was encouraging and consistent with our
earlier observation. Fatal adverse events adverse that
possibly, most likely, or definitely were related to
study medications occurred in 1.4% of patients, serious adverse events occurred in 44% of patients, and
grade 3 or 4 toxicities were not frequent. The CORR
of 55% was the same according to both the investigators and the external reviewers; however, the TTP
and the response duration varied considerably. There
are no obvious explanations for this discordance;
however, the external reviewers censored many more
patients that the investigators. A speculative notion
is that, because the external reviewers specialized in

40

radiology, they may have had a different perspective
when reviewing the radiographs than medical oncologists, who had extensive patient knowledge but less
skill with radiographs. This may account for the differences in the number of target lesions selected by
the 2 groups. In addition, the external reviewers had
only objective imaging data, whereas the investigators relied not only on the imaging data but also on
substantial subjective data and on other objective
data. The decisions by the investigators were made
in the clinic in real time, and decisions by the external reviewers were made at a much later date and in
a totally different context. In addition, there is the
difficult issue of differences in the number of censored patients. When the external reviewers disagreed with the investigator’s designation of disease
progression (by using the RECIST criteria), then that
patient was censored. We believe that such events
are responsible for the discordance in the time to
response and TTP data between the 2 groups. Our
data also exemplifies some inherent drawbacks of
this type of exercise. It is possible that the external
reviewers provided excellent data on CORR and
time-to-response but that the quality of data on TTP
and response duration may not have been as high as
desirable, and some discussion may be required
before such decisions are made. However, it is reassuring that there was concordance regarding the
CORR and that the median survival of 10.4 months
for 72 patients was similar to that of 10.9 months
reported previously for 47 patients.8
Capecitabine has been studied extensively in
gastric and gastroesophageal cancers.8 However,
capecitabine and S-1 have not been compared
directly. If the results from FLAGS show that the S-1
plus cisplatin arm is superior to the 5-FU and cisplatin arm, then a direct comparison of the 2 oral fluoropyrimidines may or may not be warranted. To our
knowledge to date, data from REAL-2 trial9 suggest
that capecitabine is a suitable substitute for 5-FU
(and not superior to 5-FU). The other major difference between the REAL-2 study and FLAGS is that
the primary endpoint of REAL-2 was to demonstrate
the noninferiority of analogs (oxaliplatin and capecitabine); however, the primary endpoint of FLAGS is
to demonstrate the survival superiority of S-1 plus
cisplatin compared with 5-FU plus cisplatin. Thus, if
FLAGS demonstrates the noninferiority of S-1 compared with 5-FU, then it will not be considered an
advance. We also believe that, in the era of targeted
therapy when so many compounds are awaiting
investigation, it is no longer justified to divert precious resources to conduct noninferiority studies in
patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer. In

addition, superiority trials need to have adequate
patient numbers (>600 patients and preferably
1000 patients) with excellent clinical methodology
and flawless statistical stipulations.
In conclusion, the combination of S-1 plus cisplatin is safe and active in patients with advanced
gastric cancer. FLAGS currently is accruing patients
rapidly, and it is hoped that the results from FLAGS
will propel the therapy for advanced gastric cancer
into a new arena, in which patients will have access
to more effective and safer therapy.
