Abstract
The ability to observe changes in molecular behavior during cancer cell invasion in vivo remains a major
challenge to our understanding of the metastatic process. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, an analysis of
RhoA activity at a subcellular level using FLIM-FRET (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-fluorescence
resonance energy transfer) imaging in a live animal model of pancreatic cancer. In invasive mouse pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells driven by mutant p53 (p53R172H), we observed a discrete fraction of high
RhoA activity at both the leading edge and rear of cells in vivo which was absent in two-dimensional in vitro
cultures. Notably, this pool of active RhoA was absent in noninvasive p53fl knockout PDAC cells, correlating with
their poor invasive potential in vivo. We used dasatanib, a clinically approved anti-invasive agent that is active in
this model, to illustrate the functional importance of spatially regulated RhoA. Dasatanib inhibited the activity of
RhoA at the poles of p53R172H cells in vivo and this effect was independent of basal RhoA activity within the cell
body. Taken together, quantitative in vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging illustrated that RhoA is not only necessary
for invasion, but also that subcellular spatial regulation of RhoA activity, as opposed to its global activity, is likely to
govern invasion efficiency in vivo. Our findings reveal the utility of FLIM-FRET in analyzing dynamic biomarkers
during drug treatment in living animals, and they also show how discrete intracellular molecular pools might be
differentially manipulated by future anti-invasive therapies. Cancer Res; 71(3); 747–57. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Coordinated activity of the RhoGTPases RhoA, Rac1, and
Cdc42 has been extensively studied during cell motility and
migration in vitro (1). RhoA is known to control actomyosinbased contractility and retraction at the rear of the cell
whereas Rac and Cdc42 regulate lamellipodia and filopodia
formation at the front of the cell, respectively (2, 3). The ability
to visualize the precise spatial and temporal activity of
RhoGTPase family members using fluorescent reporters in
vitro has rapidly enhanced our understanding of their distinct
roles in cell motility (4–7). This approach has also provided an

insight into their role in other key biological processes and
diseases such as cancer (4, 8, 9). Recently, several elegant
studies have focused on RhoA activity during the initial events
of protrusion at the leading edge and poles of cells in vitro (5,
10–12). In particular, using fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) reporters of individual RhoGTPases simultaneously within the same cell, RhoA activity was shown to
synchronize with leading edge protrusion both spatially and
temporally (11). This, in combination with the recent manipulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity using light-switchable
probes, has confirmed that RhoA activity plays a key role in
protrusion in addition to its previously reported role in cell
retraction during cell motility (12). Altered expression or
activity of RhoA has been positively correlated with numerous
forms of human metastatic disease (8, 13–15), and taken with
these novel findings regarding RhoA activity at the cell poles
during motility, prompted us to assess, for the first time, the
spatial regulation of RhoA activity during cancer cell invasion
in live animals.
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal forms of human
cancer, with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 5% (16,
17). Initiating Kras mutations occur in approximately 90% of
human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; refs. 18–20)
whereas TP53 mutations arise in 50% to 75% of human
pancreatic cancers (21). Previously, we have utilized a recently
developed mouse model of invasive and metastatic pancreatic
cancer (22) in which Cre-Lox technology is used to target

KrasG12D and mutant p53R172H to the mouse pancreas via the
Pdxl promoter. This results in the formation of preinvasive
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanIN) which develop
into invasive and metastatic PDACs (22). Using this model, we
have recently demonstrated that mutations of Trp53, rather
than loss of p53, drives invasion and metastasis in pancreatic
cancer, thereby indicating a gain-of-function role for the
accumulation of mutant p53 (23). Moreover, we and others
have shown that mutant p53 drives invasion and metastasis in
cancers other than the pancreas including colon, lung, and
breast cancer (24, 25). Recently, cooperation between mutant
p53 and oncogenic Ras has been shown to activate RhoA and
induce cell motility in vitro (26). In line with this, mutant p53
has also been shown to induce the expression of the RhoAspecific guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1, a regulator of RhoA activity at the leading edge and rear of the cell
during motility in a large number of cancer types including the
pancreas (27, 28).
As the KrasG12D/p53R172H mouse model (22) recapitulates
human pancreatic tumorigenesis in terms of histopathology,
disease progression, and metastatic profile (29, 30), it provides an excellent system to examine for the first time the
precise spatial regulation of RhoA activity in an in vivo model
of invasive pancreatic cancer. To investigate the activity of
RhoA, we initially established cells from invasive pancreatic
tumors of Pdxl-Cre, LSL-KRasG12D/þ, LSL-Trp53R172H/þ mice
and corresponding noninvasive tumor cells from Pdx1-Cre,
LSL-KRasG12D/þ, Trp53LoxP/þ mice (23). From these cells, we
generated stable PDAC lines expressing a modified version
of the Raichu-RhoA FRET reporter (4, 31). RhoA activity in
individual cells within subcutaneous tumors was then
assessed using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
(FLIM)-FRET in live animals, allowing us to observe this
phenomenon in a more physiologic and functional context.
Importantly, we demonstrate spatially restricted pools of
RhoA activity that are specifically sensitive to drug treatment and correlate with invasion in vivo. This result, taken
with our assessment of RhoA activity during organotypic
invasion, demonstrates significant differences in the subcellular spatial regulation of RhoA in 3 dimensions compared with standard 2-dimensional culture models.
Importantly, this work highlights the advantages of live,
subcellular, animal imaging in the assessment of invasion
and metastasis and demonstrates that FLIM-FRET imaging
can be adapted for the in vivo assessment and quantification
of subtle, context-dependent responses to therapeutic intervention in the treatment of cancer.

Results and Discussion
Generation of a FLIM-FRET–based genetic model of
invasive pancreatic cancer
The use of FLIM to measure FRET reporters has rapidly
enhanced our understanding of various biological processes
by allowing us to obtain a detailed picture of protein behavior
both spatially and temporally in vitro (34, 35). To study RhoA
activity during pancreatic cancer cell invasion in vivo, we first
established primary invasive pancreatic tumor cell lines from
Pdxl-Cre, LSL-KRasG12D/þ, LSL-Trp53R172H/þ mice and noninvasive pancreatic tumor cell lines from Pdx1-Cre, LSLKRasG12D/þ, Trp53LoxP/þ mice (23). Using these cells, we then
generated stable PDAC cell lines expressing a GFP-RFP variant
of the Raichu-RhoA FRET-reporter (Fig. 1A; refs. 4, 31). The
resulting invasive mutant p53R172H and noninvasive p53fl
PDAC cells expressing the RhoA-reporter with a common
initiating KrasG12D/þ mutation (22) serve as an excellent
genetic and fluorescent model system to directly compare
the spatial regulation of RhoA activity in pancreatic cancer.

sion of the Q63L GTPase-deficient mutant probe resulted in a
maximum active lifetime of 1.7 to 1.8 nanoseconds in both
PDAC cell lines (Fig. 1B).
To assess the range of fluorescence lifetime of the probe
with known biochemical inactivation or activation, we serumstarved cells for 48 hours to reduce RhoA activity and subjected cells to biochemical stimulation (see Supplementary
Fig. 1). Low, basal RhoA activity is represented in the lifetime
color maps with red/yellow colors, whereas high RhoA activity
is represented as blue colors and areas with a low signal-tonoise ratio in which a lifetime measurement cannot be
achieved are black. Stimulation with known RhoA activators,
such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or calpeptin, significantly
activated the probe globally giving an average lifetime of
approximately 1.8 and 1.9 nanoseconds, respectively (see
Supplementary Fig. 1A–C with accompanying lifetime color
maps and Rhotekin pull-down assay), whereas addition of cellpermeable C3 transferase resulted in the probe remaining in
the inactive state (see Supplementary Fig. 1A; refs. 1, 36).
Finally, in line with this, overexpression of a constitutively
active RhoGEF, onco-Lbc (37), also significantly activated the
RhoA reporter globally within the cell resulting in an average
lifetime of 1.7 to 1.8 nanoseconds (see Supplementary Fig. 1A).
To assess whether fluorescence lifetime imaging could be
used to rapidly and accurately detect subtle changes in RhoA
activity, invasive mutant p53R172H PDAC cells were initially
subjected to wound heal assays in which the activity of RhoA
in individual cells at the leading edge of the wound was
compared with confluent cells at the rear within different
time frames. At early time points after wounding, small
subpopulations of cells proximal to the wound edge showed
significant activation of RhoA activity, as determined by low
fluorescence lifetime measurements resulting from FRET of
the RhoA reporter (Fig. 1C, white arrows indicate active cells
with a fluorescence lifetime of approximately 1.8–1.9 nanoseconds that appear blue on the lifetime color map). In contrast,
cells at the rear of the wound had a low basal level of activity
(Fig. 1D, red arrows and quantified in Fig. 1E). Importantly,
using a Rhotekin-based RhoA-GTP pull-down assay, the difference in RhoA regulation at the wound edge could not be
detected when only one scratch wound was performed
(Fig. 1F). Only when multiple wounds were performed was
the activation of RhoA apparent in the Rhotekin-based pulldown assay (Fig. 1F), demonstrating the advantages of singlecell fluorescence lifetime imaging over standard biochemical
techniques in which these effects may be masked.
The specific activation of RhoA in cells at the wound edge
suggests that a gradient of RhoA activity may exist within the
local environment of migrating tumors. In line with this,
differential activity or expression of key proteins at the
invasive edge of tumors, or in "hot spots" within a tumor
population in vivo, have previously been demonstrated using
immunohistochemical staining of fixed tumor sections (32,
38). Consistent with this, using FRAP (fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching) or photoactivation, we have recently
demonstrated in vivo that E-cadherin–based junctions and
plasma membrane dynamics, both of which play vital roles in
invasion, are also locally regulated by different environmental

750

cues within the tumor cell population (39). Using FLIM-FRET
to assess protein behavior in individual cells, within living
animals, during invasion would, therefore, provide a more
detailed understanding of cell activity during this process and
may ultimately contribute to the development of novel, targeted anti-invasive drug therapies.
Spatial regulation of RhoA activity during threedimensional organotypic pancreatic cancer invasion
Invasion in complex 3-dimensional matrices that mimic in
vivo conditions, such as organotypic assays, has revealed
distinct modes of cell locomotion adopted by cancer cells
that are governed by both the surrounding stromal cells and
the density and topography of the extracellular matrix (40, 41).
To determine whether RhoA plays a role in mutant p53R172Hdriven pancreatic cancer cell invasion (23, 27, 28), we examined PDAC cell invasion in a 3-dimensional organotypic
model. We established organotypic cultures of primary human
fibroblasts and rat tail fibrillar collagen I (33, 40), which when
exposed to an air–liquid interface creates a chemotactic
gradient that induces invasion of overlayed cancer cells
(see Supplementary Movie 2, cancer cells in green invading
over fibroblasts in red). The invasion of mutant p53R172H or
p53fl PDAC cells was assessed over an 8- to 12-day period, in
combination with multiphoton-based second harmonic imaging of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM; see Supplementary Movies 3–5, cancer cells in green, ECM appears
purple). Consistent with our recent in vivo data (23), we
observed that mutant p53R172H PDAC cells degrade and collectively invade into the matrix, whereas p53fl PDAC cells
remained on top of the matrix surface (Fig. 2A and B).
Quantification of the percentage of total PDAC cells in the
organotypic assay that invade beyond 30 mm as a ratio of cells
on top by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining confirmed
that expression of mutant p53R172H confers the capacity for
PDAC cells to invade over time, whereas p53fl cells do not
invade (Fig. 2C). Importantly, inhibition of ROCK, the downstream effector of RhoA, using the inhibitor Y27632 significantly reduced the invasion of mutant p53R172H PDAC cells in
the organotypic assay at both 8 and 12 days of invasion (Fig. 2C
and Supplementary Fig. 6). Similar results were observed upon
treatment with cell-permeable C3 transferase, suggesting that
activation of the RhoA pathway plays a critical role in pancreatic cancer cell invasion (Fig. 2C). A similar induction of
invasion was observed when the human equivalent of murine
p53R172H (p53R175H) was expressed in p53 null PDAC cells
(Fig. 2D and E and quantified in 2F).
To specifically investigate a role for RhoA during invasion,
we accurately measured RhoA activity using FLIM-FRET at
day 0 and day 8 of organotypic invasion. Fluorescence lifetime
imaging of p53fl cells on the matrix surface revealed a weak
basal activity of RhoA at day zero (Fig. 3D, column 1) and when
exposed to a chemotactic gradient for 8 days, failed to activate
RhoA above basal levels (Fig. 3A and quantified in 3D, column
2), correlating with the absence of cell invasion (Fig. 2A).
Similarly, over a longer time course of up to 21 days (see
Supplementary Fig. 7), these cells did not invade, consistent
with in vivo data (23). In contrast, fluorescence lifetime imaging

RhoA Activity In Vivo

red arrows depict examples of cells analyzed by FLIM-FRET at
depth). Analysis of RhoA activity up to 150 mm within the
matrix (Fig. 3C), demonstrated that actively invading mutant
p53R172H cells have an enhanced average activity of RhoA
compared with those present on the matrix surface (quantified in Fig. 3D, column 5). A similar increase in RhoA activity at
approximately 150 mm was also observed over a longer time
course of up to 12 days of invasion (see Supplementary Fig. 8).
Interestingly, in the majority of invading mutant p53R172H
cells, we observed a discrete fraction of active RhoA at the pole
of the cells (Fig. 3C, white arrow and quantified in 3E).
Significantly, we did not observe this subcellular spatial
regulation of RhoA activity within cells in 2-dimensional
culture at the rear or front of migrating cells (Fig. 1C and
D). This suggests that in a 3-dimensional context, RhoA may
be spatially regulated at the poles of mutant p53R172H cells to
drive protrusion.
Fluorescence lifetime imaging of RhoA activity in a live
animal microenvironment
Our ability to use fluorescence lifetime imaging at depth to
assess RhoA activity in 3 dimensions and the added contextual
detail this provides prompted us to investigate whether we
can assess RhoA activity under more native physiologic conditions in live animals. Imaging invasion in a live animal
setting is inherently difficult due to sample instability, autofluorescence, poor tissue penetration, and light scattering (40,
43, 44). Recent advances in multiphoton microscopy as
described here, however, have improved both the resolution
and imaging depth thereby providing a powerful tool for
directly observing key events in the invasive and metastatic
process in situ. PDAC cells were therefore grown as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice and the ability of multiphoton-

based FLIM to measure activity of the RhoA reporter within
tumor tissue was examined (see the Materials and Methods
section). The added sensitivity of a multichannel TCSPC PMT
detector allowed us to detect the activity of RhoA up to
approximately 150 mm within solid tumor tissue, allowing
cells completely surrounded by ECM, stroma, and vasculature
to be readily assessed in vivo.
The fluorescence lifetime of the RhoA reporter in PDAC
cells was quantified in vivo at different sites within the tumor.
Consistent with our data showing that loss, as compared with
mutation, of p53 in the pancreatic mouse model results in
noninvasive PDAC cells (Supplementary Fig. 9 and ref. 23), we
observed low RhoA activity in p53fl cells in vivo (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, we found a geometrically distinct subcellular fraction of active RhoA at the poles of invasive mutant p53R172H
PDAC cells in vivo (Fig. 4B, white arrows and inset compared
with Fig. 4A, white arrows and inset). Quantification of the
subcellular distribution within the cell body and poles confirmed that the spatial regulation of RhoA activity was only
exhibited by invasive mutant p53R172H PDAC cells and not
p53fl cells (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that the fraction of
active RhoA at the poles of cells in vivo may contribute to
invasion. This observation is consistent with recent work in
zebra fish, by Kardash and colleagues, where RhoA was shown
to drive protrusion in polarized germ cells at the leading edge
during embryonic development (9).

shown that therapeutic intervention with dasatinib, a clinically approved anti-invasive Src inhibitor, significantly impairs
metastatic burden in these mice (32). This, together with
previous work by our group showing the reciprocal relationship between RhoGTPases and Src kinase activity during
polarized cell motility (45) prompted us to assess the effect
of dasatinib treatment on RhoA activity in the invasive mutant
p53 PDACs both in organotypic assays and in live animals.
Dasatinib treatment in the organotypic assay significantly
reduced both murine p53R172H and human p53R175H-driven
PDAC cell invasion (Fig. 5A and B), consistent with our
previous finding in vivo (32). We therefore went on to investigate the effect of dasatinib on invasive mutant p53R172H
PDACs in a live animal setting. Mice bearing subcutaneous
PDAC tumors were treated with 10 mg/kg of dasatinib (32, 39)
for 3 days prior to fluorescence lifetime imaging of RhoA
activity in conjunction with second harmonic imaging of the
host ECM (Fig. 6A and C shows cells in green and ECM by
second harmonic imaging in purple; Supplementary Fig. 10

shows dasatinib-mediated inhibition of Src activity in vivo by
immunoblotting). Strikingly, although the polarized and protrusive morphology of mutant p53R172H PDAC cells remained
present upon dasatinib treatment (compare green fluorescence images in Fig. 6A and C, white arrows), the subcellular
pool of RhoA activity at the front and rear of cells, as
determined using FLIM, was inactivated (compare fluorescence lifetime images Fig. 6B and D, white arrows and insets).
Quantification confirmed that while basal RhoA activity
within the cell body of mutant p53R172H PDAC cells was not
affected, dasatinib treatment specifically inactivated RhoA
activity at the poles of cells in vivo (Fig. 6E). Whether this
polar RhoA activity is driving contraction, protrusion or both
in vivo is currently unknown. This, however, could be
addressed in the future by simultaneously imaging protrusion
and contraction in live animals with real-time FLIM-FRET (5,
11). Moreover, it is also possible that this spatially localized
inhibition may affect cell adhesion/interaction with the surrounding ECM components in vivo as both impairment of

RhoA and Src have previously been shown to play key roles in
adhesion dynamics (1, 8, 45, 46). This could, therefore, partially
explain the reduced invasive and metastatic efficiency found
in dasatinib-treated mice and therefore warrants further
investigation in the future (32).
As we have shown, fluorescence lifetime imaging allows the
differential regulation of protein activity within a tumor cell
population to be individually assessed (Fig. 1). Consistent with
this, we find that not all cells in vivo treated with dasatinib are
inactive (Fig. 6F). Approximately 80% of mutant p53R172H cells,

www.aacrjournals.org

examined using FLIM, exhibited RhoA activity in control mice,
and upon dasatinib treatment, we observe that approximately
20% of cells remain active within the tumors, independent of
drug treatment (Fig. 6F). This is likely to be due to critical
differences within the solid tumor cell mass, for example due
to poor vasculature or limited perfusion and access of the drug
to key areas of the tumor (47). In this regard, recent exciting
work has addressed the role tumor-associated matrix and
stromal tissue plays in pancreatic cancer drug delivery (48).
Using the mutant p53R172H mouse model described here,

combination therapy to deplete tumor-associated matrix and
improve vasculature using the Hedgehog inhibitor IPI-926 was
shown to improve the delivery and efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug treatment to solid tumors (48). As the small
fraction of active cells that we observe may progress and
form micrometastases after initial therapeutic intervention
and/or tumor resection, it would be beneficial to pinpoint
areas of poor drug delivery within different tumor microenvironments using FLIM-FRET in the future.
The adaptation of 2-dimensional fluorescence techniques
for intravital imaging has resulted in a new era of contextdependent in vivo imaging, providing a greater picture of key
biological events in situ (39, 42, 43, 49). Here, we have demonstrated the first use of FLIM-FRET to monitor molecular
dynamics of RhoA in tumors upon therapeutic intervention.
In doing so, we have specifically isolated at a subcellular level a
small yet important pool of RhoA, not observed in vitro, that is
sensitive to drug treatment and correlates with invasion.
These differences have implications for cancer research, in
which the behavior of key molecules associated with motility,
invasion, and metastasis in vitro are used to reveal basic
biological mechanisms which are then extrapolated back into
the human disease (39, 50). Such detailed topological analysis
in vivo enables the detection of subtle changes in protein
activity following therapeutic interventions that are intractable to in vitro assessment and could improve the current high
attrition rate of compounds entering clinical trials in the
future (50).
The distinct subcellular regulation of RhoA at the poles of
invading cells observed here sets a precedent that other key
RhoGTPases or proteins involved in invasion may also be
tightly regulated in such a manner in vivo. The use of this
technique for the assessment of other prototypical Rho family
GTPases, including Rac and Cdc42, could therefore provide
insight into their coordinated regulation in vivo not only
during invasion and metastasis but also in the context of
other biological processes such as transformation, cell-cycle
progression, transcriptional activation, and response to drug

treatment (1, 15, 45). Also, as described earlier, Rho GEFs,
GAPs, and GDIs act as integrated upstream "molecular
switches", critical for control of RhoGTPases, and are commonly mutated or aberrantly regulated in many cancer types
including the pancreas (8). The use of FLIM to measure FRET
reporters, in conjunction with the assessment of altered Rhosignaling components, could allow us to investigate whether
global or site-specific deregulation of RhoGTPase activity
contributes to these cancer types.
Finally, we and others have recently shown that mutant p53
drives invasion and metastasis in pancreatic, colon, lung, and
breast cancer (24, 25) and that altered regulation of cell–ECM
interactions via integrins seems to play a central role in
driving invasion (24). As RhoA is involved in integrin
inside-out and outside-in signaling (46), investigation of RhoA
activity in these mutant p53-driven cancers should provide a
new level of detail regarding the regulation of RhoA during
cell–ECM interactions in the course of invasion in vivo as a
potential effector of mutant p53.
