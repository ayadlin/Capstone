ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide.
The poor prognosis of CRC is mainly due to uncontrolled tumor growth and distant
metastases. In this study, we found that the level of FGF8 was elevated in the great
majority of CRC cases and high FGF8 expression was significantly correlated with
lymph nodes metastasis and worse overall survival. Functional studies showed that
FGF8 can induce a more aggressive phenotype displaying epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and enhanced invasion and growth in CRC cells. Consistent with this,
FGF8 can also promote tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models. Bioinformatics
and pathological analysis suggested that YAP1 is a potential downstream target of
FGF8 in CRC cells. Molecular validation demonstrated that FGF8 fully induced nuclear
localization of YAP1 and enhanced transcriptional outcomes such as the expression
of CTGF and CYR61, while decreasing YAP1 expression impeded FGF-8–induced
cell growth, EMT, migration and invasion, revealing that YAP1 is required for FGF8mediated CRC growth and metastasis. Taken together, these results demonstrate
that FGF8 contributes to the proliferative and metastatic capacity of CRC cells and
may represent a novel candidate for intervention in tumor growth and metastasis
formation.

INTRODUCTION

mortality attributable to CRC is approximately half that
of its incidence and 8% of all cancer deaths[3]. CRC
survival is related to the stage of disease at diagnosis, with
over 90% 5-year survival rate for cancers identified at an
early stage; 70% with regional spread to less than 10% for
patients with metastatic disease[3, 4]. Understanding of
the molecular mechanisms of the disease in individuals
at high risk of rapid tumor growth and progression is

Although the increased acceptance of colonoscopy,
which allows for the removal of precancerous lesions,
has led to a decline in the incidence of colorectal cancer
(CRC), it remains the third most commonly diagnosed
types of cancer and the fourth leading causes of cancer
death for both men and women worldwide[1, 2]. Globally,

important for improved CRC prevention and control.
The human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family
consists of at least 23 different members that can be
broadly grouped according to their affinity for FGF
receptors (FGFRs)[5-9]. FGFs can act as mitogens,
morphogens, and inducers of angiogenesis, and are
required for many critical processes in the development
of diverse tissues and organs from the earliest stages[5-9].
With such fundamental embryonic and homeostatic roles,
FGFs are expressed in almost all tumor tissues[5-9].
For example, FGF1, FGF2, FGF6, FGF9 and FGF17
were overexpressed in prostate cancer, while FGF3
overexpression was observed in non-small-cell lung
carcinoma[7-10]. The role of the FGF family has been
also widely studied during tumor growth and metastasis
and has been shown to induce EMT and increase the
proliferative, motility and invasiveness of a variety of cell
types[5, 6, 11]. For example, FGF1, FGF7 and FGF10
can induce EMT in bladder carcinoma cells[7]. Recently,
FGFs have been shown to be involved in the progression
of CRC. Elevated expression of FGF9, FGF10, FGF18,
FGF-23 and FGFR2IIIc was observed in CRC, and
expression of FGF9 and FGFR2IIIc negatively correlated
with patients’ survival[9, 12-16]. In a previous study, we
also demonstrated that FGFR4 promoted stroma-induced
EMT in CRC and controls CRC cell metastasis in vivo[17].
However, the role of other FGFs in CRC, including FGF8,
remains unclear.
FGF8 was originally identified as an androgeninduced growth factor from the conditioned medium
of the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line SC-3[18,
19]. FGF8 is rarely detected in normal adult tissues, but
widely expressed during embryonic development and in
several forms of hormonal cancer including human breast,
ovarian and prostate cancer[19-23]. FGF8 has been shown
to mediate embryonic epithelial to mesenchymal direction
and a mesenchymal to epithelial differentiation during
embryonic development and is involved in gastrulation,
early differentiation and organogenesis of brain, limbs
and kidney[19, 22, 23]. High levels of FGF8 expression in
clinical samples is associated with tumor progression and
a poor prognosis in several cancers, including prostate and
breast cancer[19-21, 24, 25]. In cell culture and transgenic
animal models, FGF8 facilitates breast, prostate and
ovarian cancer tumorgenesis, and increases tumor growth
and angiogenesis by autocrine and paracrine loops[19,
26-29]. FGF8 is also known to confer an aggressive
transformed phenotype to several cancer cells[19, 29]. For
example, FGF-8 can enhance the invasive and migratory
capacity of prostate cancer cells in vitro and promote
bone metastasis in vivo[19, 29, 30]. In mouse mammary
tumor cells, overexpression of FGF8 can induce EMT and
anchorage independent growth in vitro and accelerated
tumor growth in vivo[19, 31].
The Hippo signaling pathway was initially defined
as a major regulator of tissue growth and organ size
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster[32-35].
Most upstream components in the Hippo pathway are
evolutionarily conserved and serve as tumor suppressors
in mammals[32-35].The mammalian Hippo pathway
comprises Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), Large tumor
suppressors 1 and 2 (Lats1/2), Mammalian STE-20
kinases 1 and 2 (Mst1/2) and Mspone-binder (MOB1)[3235]. YAP1, a nuclear transcriptional co-activator, binds
to several transcription factors, such as ErbB4,SMAD,
RUNX, TBX5, p73 and TEAD1-4, regulating the
expression of diverse genes which are involved in the
control of cell proliferation, apoptosis and movement[33,
34, 36-38]. Mst1/2-mediated Lats1/2 activation can
negatively regulate the function of YAP1 by inducing
phosphorylation of YAP1 on Ser 127 and Ser 358[33, 34,
37]. YAP1 amplification has been described as an essential
oncogene in a large number of human cancers, including
gesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, hepatocellular
carcinomas, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer,
ovarian cancer and CRC[33, 34, 36, 39, 40]. For example,
transgenic mice with YAP1 over-expression or knockout of Hippo pathway genes show liver overgrowth with
the eventual development of hepatic tumors[41], while
YAP1 ectopic expression in cultured cells promotes
cell growth and oncogenic transformation by activating
TEAD-mediated transcription of the cell proliferation
gene connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)[42, 43].
In addition, YAP1 was shown to be under-expressed in
normal intestine, but highly expressed in CRC[44-46].
In the present study, we show that FGF8 is
overexpressed in advanced CRC and promotes
proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells by activating
YAP1, suggesting FGF8 is a potential therapeutic target
in CRC.

RESULTS
FGF8 is overexpressed in human CRC
To determine the expression pattern of FGF8 in
human colorectal tissues, paired non-tumor and tumor
tissues (n = 5) from frozen tissue samples were analyzed by
qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. FGF8 expression was
found to be overexpressed in CRC tissues compared with
adjacent non-tumor tissues at both the mRNA and protein
levels (Figure 1A and 1B). Immunohistochemistry staining
was further performed on a panel of 98 colorectal cancer
specimens and 42 matched adjacent normal colorectal
mucosa specimens to investigate the potential clinical role
of FGF8 in CRC. As shown in Figure 2A, strong FGF8
staining was mainly observed in the cytoplasm of tumor
cells, while weak FGF8 expression was detected in the
proliferative zone of colorectal epithelium in normal
colorectal tissue, but no FGF8 expression was detected

in superficial colorectal epithelial cells. FGF8 positive
staining was observed in 99% (97/98) of CRC tissues
compared to 42% (18/43) of normal mucosa tissues. The
staining intensity for FGF8 in tumor cells was significantly
higher than in normal mucosal epithelial cells (Figure 2B).
These results demonstrate that FGF8 is overexpressed in
CRC.

T3/4 stage disease (Figure 2D, right). In a univariate
analysis examining clinic-pathologic prognostic variables,
the expression of FGF8 was significantly correlated
with overall survival. Factors showing significance by
univariate analysis were adopted in multivariate Cox
proportional hazards analysis. The result showed that
FGF8 acted as a potential prognostic marker for predicting
patient outcome.

Elevated FGF8 is associated with lymph node
metastasis and poor survival in CRC patients

FGF8 promotes an aggressive phenotype in CRC
cells

We next analyzed the relationship between FGF8
expression in tumor tissues and the clinic-pathological
parameters of the 97 CRC patients. The results showed
that FGF8 expression was not associated with patient age,
sex or tumor size (data not shown), but was significantly
associated with lymph node metastasis. In both earlystage (T1/2) and late-stage (T3/4) colorectal carcinoma,
FGF8 expression was much higher in the primary CRC
tissue from individual patients with metastatic lymph
nodes compared to those without metastatic lymph nodes,
suggesting FGF8 is involved in metastasis of CRC (Figure
2C).
Moreover, FGF8 levels were also prognostic for
overall survival (OS). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
showed that subjects with high FGF8 expression had a
significantly shorter 5-year OS time compared to those
subjects with low FGF8 expression (log-rank test, P <
0.001, Figure 2D, left). Furthermore, a high level of
FGF8 expression was more likely to be associated with
poor outcome in patients with T1/2stage colorectal
carcinoma (Figure 2D, middle) compared to those with

To determine the potential significance of FGF8 in
colorectal cancer progression, the proliferative, migratory
and invasive capacities of RKO cells were compared in the
presence or absence of FGF8. As shown as Figure 3A-C,
FGF8 produced about 1.8-fold more colonies in the colony
formation assay (Figure 3A) and 2-fold augmentation of
BrdU labeling (Figure 3B), induced RKO cells migration
by approximate 1.6-fold and increased the invasion
potential as demonstrated by matrigel invasion by more
than 2-fold (Figure 3C). These effects were inhibited after
treatment of cells with a pan FGFR inhibitor, PD173074
(Figure 3A-C).To rule out the potential cell type specific
effect, we further examine the role of FGF8 on other two
CRC cell lines, SW480 and HCT116. As expected, FGF8
treatment also significantly enhanced the proliferative,
migratory and invasive ability of both SW480 and
HCT116 cells (Figure S1).These results demonstrate that
FGF8 promotes an aggressive phenotype in CRC cells.
FGF8 has been commonly studied during
developmental and pathological EMT, which is widely

considered to contribute to cancer metastasis[19].
Therefore, it was of particular interest to examine whether
there was an involvement of FGF8 in the EMT process
of CRC cells. The results showed that FGF8 treatment
induced a mesenchymal phenotype in RKO cell line
(Figure 3D). Further, FGF8 treatment also reduced
expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and
increased the levels of mesenchymal markers Vimentin
and Snail in RKO, SW480 and HCT116 cells, and that
these effects could also be abrogated by PD173074 (Figure
3E and Figure S2), suggesting FGF8 induces a malignant
phenotype by promoting EMT in CRC cells.

To study the effect of FGF-8 on tumor growth
and metastasis in vivo, RKO cells stably expressing
FGF-8 (RKO-FGF8) or mock vector (RKO-mock) were
subcutaneously or intravenously injected into nude mice to
assess local tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. As
shown as Figure 4A, the growth of those tumors formed
by RKO-FGF8 cells following subcutaneous injection was
much faster than control tumors, indicated by increased

tumor volume and expression of Ki67. In the mouse
lung metastatic assay, the weight of the lungs following
injection of RKO-FGF8 cells was markedly increased
compared with injection of control cells. Additionally,
the average number of metastases in mice lungs derived
from RKO-FGF8 cells was 1.5-fold greater than control
cells as determined by H&E staining (P < 0.01; Figure
4B). These results show that FGF8 has a profound impact
on the tumor growth and formation of metastases by the
CRC cells.

PPI databases, including 37,710 from BioGRID among
8,982 proteins, 8,044 from BOND among 4,073 proteins,
14,892 from HomoMINT among 6,240 proteins, 39,044
from HPRD among 9,619 proteins, and 34,935 from
IntAct among 8,849 proteins. A total number of 85,083
unique PPIs addressing 13, 128 proteins were prepared as
a data source for our Gold Standard Positive (GSP) set
by integrating PPIs from online databases (Figure 5A).
Proteins located in plasma membrane seldom interact
with those in nucleus; therefore, we generated a Golden
Standard Negative (GSN) set that could be defined as all
the possible pair-wise combinations, in which one protein
is assigned to the plasma membrane and the other to the
nucleus according to GO cellular component annotation,
resulting in 23,169,177 pairs in our GSN. Additionally,
there are 25,620 and 204,919,890 protein pairs in the STS
and raw predicted dataset.
According to the two golden sets, we integrated
four different types of biological datasets and chose the
likelihood ratio (LR=117) as the reliability of individual
dataset for inferring the PPIs. Each dataset could be
divided into several bins due to their intrinsic characters,
and LR for each bin was calculated, indicating the

Construction of the global PPI network
To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying
FGF8-induced proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells,
we computationally constructed a global human PPI
network, covering almost all PPIs from IntAct, HPRD,
HomoMINT, BOND and BioGRID. Owing to this
mathematics model, we identified 2,110 apoptosis-related
proteins (GO: 0006915) from GO database. To construct
the set of true-positive gene pairs, physical proteinprotein interactions were derived from manually created

respectively. Subsequently, we used LR cutoff as 113
and achieved the global PPI network with 12,809 binary
PPIs by combining the prediction set and the positive set.

which is bigger than or equal to 300 as our standard for
identifying candidate hub proteins.
Secondly, we ensure that hub proteins connect more
cancer-related proteins that have been annotated by GO
than other (non-hub) proteins, thereby giving them a
particular focus when developing novel cancer targets.
We choose the number of links to other known cancerrelated proteins that are bigger than or equal to 300 (the
standard of classical hub proteins) or 200 (the standard of
novel hub proteins) respectively as our standard for further
filtering candidate hub proteins. Thirdly, we suggest that
the network module is crucial for helping to identify hub
proteins because they typically enrich in the “dense area”
rather than “sparse area” in cancer. Thus, we found a few
of conserved modules that could enrich more candidate
hub proteins into the network.
Fourthly, since significance analysis of microarrays
(SAM) analysis is performed on data from expression
microarray to identify genes with greatly divergent
expressions between normal and CRC cells, we indicated
that the proteins, identified as divergent expression
proteins that were extracted as functional hub proteins,
are dependent on gene co-expression profile.

Multiple analyses of hub proteins and
identification of FGF8-YAP1 interaction in CRC
cells
In this study, we identified hub proteins implicated
in core pathways according to the following four golden
standards (Figure 5A). Firstly, the degree of each protein
in the function-related network is calculated as the number
of links that one protein possesses to the other, where
high-degree proteins tend to play a more important role
in the network. Thus, we selected the number of degrees

As a result, we computationally constructed the
global human PPI network, and further modified it into the
core network. The four above-mentioned gold standards
which can be integrated into an appropriate approach to
decrease the false-positive PPIs were used in this study.
Furthermore, cancer-related hub proteins in the global PPI
network (Figure. 5B) were classified by their different
subcellular localizations (Figure. 5C). Interestingly, we
found that FGF8 plays a key role in this sub-network,
interacting with other hub proteins, such as YAP1, in the
context of CRC cells (Figure. 5D).

such, YAP1 can act as an oncogene and is amplified
in various adult carcinomas including CRC[32-34].
Further, YAP1 interaction with transcription factors such
as TEAD1-4 in the nucleus can promote cancer cell
proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, EMT and
metastasis[32-34, 43]. We therefore assessed the potential
impact of FGF8 on YAP1 in CRC cells. As indicated
as Figure 6A and S3A-B, elevated expression of YAP1
was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of
FGF8-treated RKO, SW480 and HCT116 cells. Further,
FGF8 could also induce the expression of YAP1 target
genes, CTGF and CYR61, and the transcription activity
of TEAD4, a target transcription factor of YAP1, while
the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 can abolish these effects
(Figure 6B–C and S3C-F). To explore whether YAP1 is
also correlated with FGF8 in human colorectal tissues,
levels of YAP1 were analyzed in 20 resected colorectal
cancer specimens, which were also examined with an

FGF8 can activate YAP1 signaling in CRC cells
Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a downstream
transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway,
is a major regulator of organ size by regulating cell
proliferation and survival in vertebrates[32-34]. As

antibody to FGF8. In CRC tissues, YAP1 expression was
mainly observed in the nuclear of tumor cells (Figure 6D).
Nuclear-YAP1 and FGF8 levels were plotted against each
other, and the staining of nuclear YAP1 in high-FGF8expressing tumors was stronger than that in low-FGF8expressing tumors, suggesting that the expression of YAP1
is associated with FGF8 level in colorectal cancer (Figure
6E-F).These results demonstrate that FGF8 activates
YAP1 signaling in CRC cells.

of mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Snail in FGF8treated CRC cells (Figure 7E). Similar effects were also
observed in SW480 and HCT116 cells (Figure S5 and S6).
These results indicate that YAP1 contributes to the FGF8induced proliferative and metastatic capacity of CRC cells.

YAP1 is essential for FGF8-mediated CRC
malignant progression

The Hippo pathway restricts the transcriptional
co-activation capacity of YAP1 by phosphorylating it
for cytoplasmic localization and protein degradation.
Conversely, activation of YAP1 is usually though
inhibition of Lats activity [32-34]. Thus, we next
examined the involvement of canonical Hippo signaling
in FGF8-induced activation of YAP1. As expected,
silencing Lats1/2 can activate YAP1, indicated by nuclear
translocation of YAP1, enhanced transcription of CTGF
and CYR61, and increased transcriptional activity of
TEAD4 (Figure S7). But interestingly, even when Lats1/2
was knocked down, FGF8 can further enhance the protein
level of both total and nuclear YAP1, the mRNA level of
CTGF and CYR61, as well as the transcriptional activity of
TEAD4, suggesting inhibiting degradation through Hippo

FGF8 activates YAP1 signaling through increasing
the transcription of YAP1

To determine whether YAP1 was required for
the FGF8-induced aggressive phenotype in CRC cells,
YAP1 expression was knocked down in FGF8-treated
RKO cells (Figure S4). As indicated as Figure 7Aand
B, suppression of YAP1 reduced colony number and
BrdU incorporation induced by FGF8. Additionally, it
counteracted FGF8-induced cell migration and invasion
in RKO cells (Figure 7C), accompanied with reversion to
a more compact epithelium-like morphology(Figure 7D).
Correspondingly, loss of YAP1 increased expression of
the epithelial marker E-cadherin and reduced the levels

pathway is not the only cause for FGF8-induced YAP1
accumulation(Figure S7). Therefore, we further attempt
to determine whether FGF8 regulates the transcription of
YAP1. The results showed that FGF8 treatment obviously
increased the YAP1 mRNA levels in all three CRC cell
lines, and PD173074 can inhibit this accumulation,
suggesting FGF8 can enhance the transcription of YAP1.

neoangiogenesis[5-9]. A high percentage of CRCs
overexpress a number of FGFs and FGF receptors,
including FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-3, FGF-7, FGF-9, FGF-10,
FGF-18, FGF-19, FGF-20, FGF23 and FGFR1-4[11][1216, 47-50]. For example, Sonvillaet al. showed that FGF18
was progressively enhanced during colon carcinogenesis
reaching very high levels in carcinomas and affecting
both tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment in a
pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic way[50]. SATO et al
also demonstrated a relationship between overexpression
of FGFR1 and liver metastasis in colorectal cancer[49]. In
this current study, mild immunoreactivity for FGF8 was
observed in colorectal cancer cases, and is significantly
correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis
(Figure 1 and 2).
FGF8 regulates a range of physiological processes
such as limb formation, central nervous system
development, left–right axis establishment, angiogenesis
and wound healing, as well as pathological routes to
tumorigenesis[19, 22, 23]. FGF-8 is widely expressed in
developing tissues in a temporally and spatially regulated
manner, but has a strictly restricted expression pattern in a
limited number of normal adult tissues, such as certain cell
types involved with spermatogenesis and oogenesis[19,
22, 23]. There have been no reports about FGF8 in CRC,
but aberrant expression of FGF8 has been observed in
several other cancers, especially in hormone-responsive
tumors such as prostate and breast cancer[8, 19, 24, 51]. In
prostate and breast cancer, the overexpression of FGF8 is
correlated with advanced tumor stage and shorter survival
times[8, 19, 20, 24, 25]. Transgenic expression of FGF8
in mice can induce mammary and salivary gland tumors
as well as development of ovarian stromal hyperplasia[19,

DISCUSSION
Although significant advances have been made
in diagnostic, surgical and therapeutic techniques, the
prognosis for patients with advanced or recurrent states
of CRC remains dismal[1-4]. Thus, discovery of a
sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarker for detection
of individuals with rapid tumor growth and progression,
and introduction of novel targeted therapeutic drugs are
matters of pressing concern. To improve the survival
rates of patients with advanced stage disease, the
detailed molecular mechanisms underlying initiation and
progression of CRC must first be thoroughly understood.
The FGF/FGFR family is known to be widely involved
in many physiological and pathological processes
including embryonic development, repair, tumor growth
and progression in an autocrine or paracrine manner[5-9].
FGFs exert biological effects as potent growth factors
for inducing proliferation and differentiation in primary
epithelial cells, which makes FGF signaling susceptible
to be hijacked by cancer cells[5-9]. Accumulating
evidence has linked carcinogenesis in a range of tissue
types with the dysregulation of FGF signaling, including
control of cancer cell proliferation, modulation of
tumor cell adhesion and migration, and support of

promote proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and enhances in
vitro invasive and metastatic capacity[33, 34, 38, 56, 59].
Recent studies also showed that YAP1 plays a pivotal role
in the initiation and progression in CRC[44-46]. In this
study, we found that FGF8 can induce activation of YAP1
signaling, and silencing of YAP1 reversed FGF8-induced
proliferation, migration and invasion in CRC cells,
suggesting YAP1 is important in the acquisition of an
aggressive phenotype in FGF8-treated CRC cells (Figure
6-7 and S3-5). In addition, YAP1 is also implicated in
EMT[38, 43]. For example, over expression of YAP1
mutants that cannot be phosphorylated, can overcome cell
contact inhibition and contribute to metastatic properties
associated with expression of EMT markers in MCF10A
mammary epithelial cells[42, 43]. Further, Shao et al
showed KRAS and YAP1 converge on the transcription
factor FOS and activate a transcriptional program involved
in regulating EMT by inducing expression of Vimentin
and Slug in CRC HCT116 cells[60]. Here, we also found
that YAP1 was essential for FGF8-mediated EMT in
RKO, SW480 and HCT116 cells (Figure 7 and S6). More
interestingly, cell–cell contact, which can restrict cell
proliferation and migration, has been shown to trigger the
Hippo pathway leading to phosphorylation of YAP1 and
thereby inhibiting its ability to stimulate proliferation and
oncogenic transformation[32-34]. Thus, YAP1-induced
EMT may induce loss of cell–cell contact leading to the
inhibition of Hippo signaling and further accumulation of
YAP1 in the nucleus of CRC cells.
Restricting the activity of YAP1 is critical
for maintaining tissue homeostasis[32-34]. Under
physiological conditions, YAP1 is phosphorylated and
inhibited by Lats kinases, which are the core components
of the Hippo pathway. Lats-mediated phosphorylation
on Ser127 promotes YAP1 binding to 14-3-3 proteins
and consequently its cytoplasmic retention, while
phosphorylation on Ser381 catalyzes YAP1 ubiquitination,
ultimately leading to YAP1 degradation[33, 34, 37, 54].
Besides Hippo signaling, several other signaling pathways
have been also shown to induce activation of YAP1, such
as WNT, integrin, Rho/Rac, Notch, TGF-β and GPCR
signaling, which are all also downstream signaling
pathways of FGFs[55, 61-67]. For example, Rosenbluh et
al showed that YAP1 was an attractive target in β-catenindriven cancers, while FGF8 can accelerate mammary
carcinogenesis in MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice[61, 64].
In present data, in addition to inhibition of Lats1/2, FGF8
can further enhance YAP1 expression by promoting YAP1
transcription, suggesting that increased transcription of
YAP1isan important cause in FGF8-induced activation of
YAP1 signaling (Figure 8 and S7).
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that
overexpression of FGF8 is correlated with metastasis
and poor prognosis in patients with CRC, and elevated
FGF8 can activate YAP1 signaling, which in turn, induces
EMT and increases growth, invasion and lung metastases

28]. Engineered overexpression of FGF8 in both prostate
and breast cancer cell lines has been shown to be tumor
promoting in many in vitro and in vivo studies[8, 19, 25,
26]. For example, the overexpression of FGF8 in prostate
cancer LNCaP cells and mammary tumor MCF-7 cells
enhanced growth and invasion in vitro and promoted
tumor growth in vivo[25, 29, 52, 53].Additionally, Valtaet
al found expression of FGF-8 in PC-3 prostate cancer cells
increased their growth as intratibial tumors and markedly
affected formation of bone lesions in this in vivo model of
prostate cancer metastasis[30]. Here, we report that FGF8
treatment accelerated the growth rate, increased both
clonogenic and invasive activity in vitro, and similarly,
overexpression of FGF8 facilitated in vivo tumorigenicity
and metastasis of CRC cells, suggesting that FGF8 plays
an important role in CRC progression (Figure3,4 and S1).
Furthermore, during early embryonic development, FGF8
has been shown to mediate EMT, which has been noted as
a critical event in the late stages of tumor progression[19].
Key steps in tumor-associated EMT are down-regulation
of E-cadherin by transcriptional repressors such as Snail1,
ZEB1, and Twist, and induction of mesenchymal-specific
gene expression, such as Vimentin, Fibronectin, and
N-cadherin, which leads to the conversion of stationary
epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells[11,
12]. In this study, we also found that FGF8 can induce a
fibroblastic change in RKO cell morphology, with altered
EMT-specific gene expression, including repression
of E-cadherin and activation of Snail and Vimentin,
indicating that FGF8 contribute to CRC metastasis by
inducing EMT (Figure 3, Figure S2).
To explore the molecular mechanism underlying
FGF8-induced proliferation and metastasis in CRC, we
analyzed the protein-protein interaction network in CRC
cells by bioinformatics and found YAP1 was a potential
downstream molecule of FGF8 (Figure 5). Pathological
data also demonstrated that the nuclear expression of
YAP1 is positively correlated with FGF8 level in clinical
CRC samples (Figure 6D-F).YAP1, a transcriptional coactivator, is inhibited by the Hippo tumor suppressor
signaling pathway and regulates multiple cellular
processes by activating several transcription factors, such
as TEAD1-4[32-38, 42, 54]. YAP1 plays a critical role in
organ growth and has been suggested to be a candidate
human oncogene in multiple tumors[33-35, 39, 41, 42,
54]. Since YAP1 is mainly involved in regulating the
transcriptional outcome to govern cell proliferation and
survival, it can be hijacked by cancer cells to facilitate
their own growth, including induction of cancer stem
cells and metastatic colonization[33-35, 39, 42, 43, 55].
The up-regulation and nuclear localization of YAP1 has
been shown to correlate with progression, metastasis
and poor patient outcome in several cancers, such as non
small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric carcinoma
and hepatocellular carcinoma[32-34, 56-58]. Further,
YAP1 overexpression in multiple cancer cell lines can

RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) and cDNA was transcribed using Revert
AidTM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Analysis was
performed on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR System
(Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical specimens
All colorectal carcinomas and corresponding
adjacent normal tissues were obtained from Sichuan
Provincial People’s Hospital (Chengdu, China).
Tumor stage was determined according to the TNM
classification system of the International Union against
Cancer (UICC) [68]. Tumor differentiation was graded
using Edmondson Steiner grading by two experienced
pathologists. The clinicopathologic characteristics of 98
patients are summarized in Table 1. Informed consent
for tissue procurement was obtained from all patients or
their relatives before study initiation, and Ethics approval
was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of
Sichuan University.

Reagents

Immunohistochemistry

Immunoblot

Slides were stained using the Envision System
horseradish peroxidase method (DakoCytomation
Inc., Carpinteria, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To estimate the score of each slide, at least
eight individual fields were chosen, and 100 cancer
cells were counted for each field. The score for each
slide was measured as the cross product of the value of
immunostaining intensity (A) and the value of proportion
of staining-positive cells (B), as described previously.
Immunostainingintensity was divided into five grades: 0,
negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong; 4, very strong.
The proportion of staining-positive cells was divided into
five grades: 0, <5%; 1, 6 –25%; 2, 26 –50%; 3, 51–75%;
4, >75%. The results were defined as: 0-4, low; 5-16, high.
Results were assessed and confirmed by two independent
experienced pathologists[17].

Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 Mm Tris
base, 1.0 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1%
Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM PMSF).
Proteins were separated on 12% or 15% SDS-PAGE,
and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham
Biosciences). After blocking with Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) containing 0.1 % Tween 20 and 5% skimmed
milk, blots were incubated with the respective primary
antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and washed 3
times in TBS with Tween20. Subsequently, the blots
were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(diluted 1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 2 h at
room temperature. Finally, the blots were visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).

PD173074 was purchased from Sigma and used at
1 µm. FGF8 recombinant protein was purchased from
Protech and used at 250 ng/ml. YAP1-specific siRNA was
purchased from Dharmacon, and the siRNAs targeting
LAST1 or LAST2 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit-antiE-cadherin (Abcam), rabbit-anti-Snail (Abcam), mouseanti-Vimentin (Santa Cruz, Abcam), mouse-anti-FGF8
(Abcam), rabbit-anti-YAP1 (Abcam), rabbit-anti-LATS1
(Abcam), rabbit-anti-LATS2 (Abcam),rabbit-anti-Histone
H3 (Abcam).

BrdU labeling assay

Cell culture

The BrdU labeling assay was performed in 96 well
plate format. BrdU was purchased from Roche Applied
Science (Indianapolis, IN). After treatment, BrdU was
added to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the cells
were incubated for another 12 h. BrdU signal was
measured by using 5-Bromo-2´-deoxy-uridine Labeling
and Detection Kit III (Roche).

The RKO, SW480 and HCT116 cell line was
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco,
USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone,
USA), penicillin (107 U/L) and streptomycin (10 mg/L)
at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2.

were from GO annotation. Raw data were constructed
by random matching amongst all the human proteins in
UniProt database.

Transwell 24-well chambers (Corning) were used
for in vitro cell migration and invasion assays. For the cell
migration assay, 2.5×104 cells were seeded in the upper
well of a transwell chamber. For the invasion assays,
Matrigel (1:3, BD, USA) was added to the transwell
chambers, and cells were seeded after incubation at 37 °C
for 4 h. Cells on the upper side of the filter were removed
after 24 h for the migration assay or 48 h for the invasion
assay. The filter membrane was stained with crystal violet,
and the number of the cells that remained adherent to the
underside of the membrane were counted using an inverted
microscope (Zeiss Axiovert).

Multiple sources of biological data
Gene co-expression profiles Proteins that can
interact with each other often possess similar gene
expression patterns; thereby, genes that can co-express
should be more likely to interact than genes that cannot
co-express. To identify genes that are co-expressed,
microarray data from colorectal cancer and normal
colorectal cells treated with 2.5 mM DTT were used to
measure the pair-wise co-expression level of related genes
[75]. The co-expression level is calculated as Pearson

All animals were humanely treated under the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Treatment
Committee of Sichuan University. For in vivo tumor
proliferation assays, 5×107 RKO cells stably expressing
FGF8 or mock vector were transplanted subcutaneously
into male athymic nude mice (5 mice per group). The
tumor volumes were evaluated as follows: tumor volume
(mm3) = (length x width2)/2. Animals were sacrificed 25
days after injection. Tumors were dissected and fixed in
formalin for immunostaining with Ki67. For metastasis
assays, 5×107 RKO-FGF8 or RKO-mock cells were
injected into male athymic nude mice (4 mice per group)
through the tail vein. Animals were sacrificed on day 35.
The lungs were excised and fixed in formalin for standard
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.

Domain-domain interaction Because physical
associations between protein domains can mediate protein
interactions, identifying the pairs of domains enriched
amongst known interacting proteins is usually used to
predict novel protein interactions. Thus, domain-domain
interaction relationships were downloaded from Pfam to
test this logic into the context of the GSP and GSN sets
[76].
Cross-species interolog mapping The human
orthologs of model organism proteins often retain similar
function; therefore, pair of human orthologs that interact
in a model organism are likely to interact in human. Model
organisms [Caenorhabditiselegans (4,649), Drosophila
melanogaster (5,527), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2,154),
Rattusnorvegicus (15,306) and Musmusculus (16,376),
Escherichia coli (541)] were mapped into human protein
pairs, by using gene orthologs defined in the Inparanoid
database by clustering into orthologous groups.

Bioinformatics analyses
Retrieval of functional genomics data
Data were collected from Human Protein Reference
Database (HPRD)[69], Biomolecular Object Network
Databank (BOND)[70], IntAct[71], HomoMINT and
BioGRID[72, 73] to build the global PPI network. All the
data were preprocessed into pair-wise scores, reflecting
the similarity between protein pairs, and Gold Standard
Positive (GSP) interaction set was constructed using
these online databases. Gold Standard Negative (GSN)
interaction set was defined through protein pairs where
one was a membrane protein (6,637 proteins) and the other
a nuclear protein (4,138 proteins), as assigned by Gene
Ontology (GO) Consortium. However, 404 proteins were
removed because they were assigned to both components,
and 23,169,177 unique pairs, in total, were identified
except for 5,275 overlapping pairs with GSP. Additionally,
the data in Standard Test Set (STS) were retrieved from
Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP)[74] and matched
randomly by these proteins, and apoptotic proteins

Smallest shared biological process (SSBP)
Interacting proteins are usually involved in the same
biological process; therefore, it is more likely to interact
each other between the proteins functioning in small,
specific processes. Functional similarity between two
proteins was calculated according to following methods:
1) to screen all biological process involving two proteins
shared; 2) to find how many other proteins in every shared
process; 3) to determine the shared biological process
with the fewest associated proteins. In general, the fewer
proteins involved in the shared biological process indicate
the greater functional similarity between two proteins.

Integration of different biological data into Naïve
Bayesian model

Data analysis and statistics
Unpaired t-test or Pearson’s correlation test was
used to compare quantitative variables; Patients’ survival
curve was plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method, and
the log-rank test was used to determine the significant
difference among groups; the Cox regression model was
used to perform multivariate analysis. Linear regression
was tested by using the Spearman rank correlation. P
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A Naive Bayesian model was developed to integrate
diverse data and make the final interaction predictions in
an integrated way[77]. Following the Bayesian theorem,
the posterior odds given n evidence as were computed as
follows:
ο posterior =

P( positive | E1 ,..., En )
P(negative | E1 ,..., En )

Conﬂicts of interest

Where positive means that two proteins are
functional related while negative means not. We define

LR( E1 ,..., En ) =

We declare that we have no conﬂicts of interest.

Naive Bayesian model supposes that each of the
evidence is conditional independent, we can simplify LR
as Since the prior odds is a constant, the predictive power
or confidence degree for predicting functional links can be
calculated by the composite LR corresponding to a type of
specific biological evidence. A cutoff of likelihood ratio
(LR cut) is represented as an indicator whether a protein
pair bears the functional relation. Then, we filter the initial
networks through Naïve Bayesian model by selecting the
pairs with composite LR above the cutoff.

A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
can elucidate the relationship between the sensitivity and
specificity of a binary classifier system for different cut
points[78]. The ROC curve can be indicated equivalently
by plotting the fraction of true positive rate (TPR) versus
the fraction of false-positive rate (FPR). In a test, the
ability of a classifier to identify true positives and false
positives can be estimated by sensitivity and specificity,
and calculated as sensitivity = TP/positives, and specificity
= 1 - (FP/negatives), where TP and FP are the number of
true positives and false positives identified by a classifier,
respectively; whereas positives and negatives are the
total number of positives and negatives in a test. The area
under the ROC curve is used to assess the efficacy of the
assessment system. Thus, the performances of different
classifiers appear to be comparable by measuring the ROC
curves, suggesting that the larger the ROC curve is; the
