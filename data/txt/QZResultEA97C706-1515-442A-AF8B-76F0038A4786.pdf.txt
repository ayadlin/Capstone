Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Hypoxia is linked to epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression in numerous
carcinomas. Responses to hypoxia are thought to operate via hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), but
the importance of co-factors that regulate HIF signaling within tumors is not well understood.
Here we elucidate a signaling pathway that physically and functionally couples tyrosine
phosphorylation of β-catenin to hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) signaling and HIF1αmediated tumor EMT. Primary human lung adenocarcinomas accumulate pY654-β-catenin and
HIF1α. All pY654-β-catenin, and only the tyrosine phosphorylated form, was found complexed
with HIF1α and active Src, both within human tumors and in lung tumor cell lines exposed to
hypoxia. Phosphorylation of Y654, generated by hypoxia mediated, reactive oxygen species
(ROS)-dependent Src kinase activation, was required for β-catenin to interact with HIF1α and Src,
to promote HIF1α transcriptional activity, and for hypoxia-induced EMT. Mice bearing hypoxic
pancreatic islet adenomas, generated by treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
antibodies, accumulate HIF1α/pY654-β-catenin complexes and develop an invasive phenotype.
Concurrent administration of the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine abrogated β-catenin/HIF pathway
activity and restored adenoma architecture. Collectively, the findings implicate accumulation of
pY654-β-catenin specifically complexed to HIF1α and Src kinase as critically involved in HIF1α
signaling and tumor invasion. The findings also suggest that targeting ROS-dependent aspects of
the pY654-β-catenin/ HIF1α pathway may attenuate untoward biological effects of antiangiogenic agents and tumor hypoxia.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The process of tumor metastasis is thought to involve EMT (1, 2). EMT involves
transcriptional reprogramming whereby epithelial tumor cells lose cell polarity and cell
junction proteins (such as E-cadherin) and at the same time acquire signal transduction
activities associated with mesenchymal cells and mesenchymal cell markers, e.g. fibronectin
(Fn), collagen I, and metalloproteinases. This reprogramming facilitates migration, survival,
and ultimately metastasis at distal sites (3, 4). Both hypoxia and overexpression of hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF)-1α and/or HIF-2α have been shown to promote EMT and metastatic
phenotypes (5, 6). Indeed the presence of tumor hypoxia has long been associated with poor
cancer outcome (7). This problem has received additional attention because of the recently
observed untoward effects of anti-angiogenic therapies on tumor invasion, likely operating
at least in part through the generation of hypoxia (8, 9). Mechanisms possibly connecting
hypoxia with EMT include intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent HIF
accumulation (10), Snail translocation (11) and HIF1α-dependent accumulation of the
transcription factors Snail, Twist, ZEB1 and ZEB2, key regulators of EMT (12). HIF1α is
reported to directly bind the Snail and Twist promoter (13, 14). Although HIF1α
accumulation is a fundamental regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia, HIF1α
transcriptional activity is dependent not only on binding to its canonical DNA hypoxia
response element (HRE) but also on a complex array of co-factors that dictate which genes
are preferentially activated in different cells exposed to hypoxia (15). One such co-factor
previously reported to bind HIF1α and promote its transcriptional activity is β-catenin (16).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Signaling through Wnt/β-catenin has been implicated in EMT in breast cancer cells via
upregulation of the Wnt target gene Axin2 followed by stabilization of nuclear Snail (17,
18). In other cells Wnt is reported to mainly influence tumor cell proliferation via induction
of c-myc and cyclin D1 (19). Indeed the principal mechanism underlying the strong
association between stabilizing mutations in β-catenin and tumor development is thought to
be β-catenin driven-tumor cell proliferation (20). In addition, a number of tyrosine
phosphorylations of β-catenin have been reported and these appear to function not simply by
promoting canonical Wnt target genes but instead by modifying the repertoire of β-catenin
binding partners. For example, Y654-β-catenin phosphorylation disrupts the association
between β-catenin and E-cadherin, favoring its transcriptional activity (21). We have
previously reported that pY654-β-catenin is found in complexes with p-Smad2 following
transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 signaling and such complexes strongly correlate with
TGFβ1-induced EMT in kidney and lung alveolar epithelial cells both ex vivo and in vivo
(22, 23). Accumulation of pY654-β-catenin following TGFβ1 stimulation had little or no
contribution to canonical Wnt pathway signaling (24). Whether hypoxia-induced EMT in
tumor cells either generates or requires pY654-β-catenin and whether tyrosine
phosphorylation of Y654 regulates β-catenin association with HIF1α is currently unknown.
Activation of several oncogenic tyrosine kinases including Src family kinases, epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) (25) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met (26) have
been reported to lead to β-catenin phosphorylation. However, only Src kinase(s) has been
shown to directly phosphorylate Y654. Though mechanisms remain undefined, overexpression of activated Src kinase has been found to promote HIF1α accumulation and its
transcriptional activity (27, 28), raising the possibility of an intrinsic linkage between Src
kinase activity and HIF1α signaling. Elevated Src activation has been reported in hypoxic

regions of tumor xenografts, but whether Src kinase activity is promoted by hypoxia in
human cancer is not reported (29). Hence it is also unknown whether hypoxia-regulated
tyrosine kinases contribute to the phosphorylation of β-catenin and hypoxia-induced EMT in
human carcinomas. This is an important point because tumor invasion and metastasis may
depend as much or more on activation of pro-invasive pathways within developed tumors as
on driver mutations implicated in tumor initiation(30, 31). In this study we explore the
importance of pY654-β-catenin accumulation in tumor responses to hypoxia.

Results
pY654-β-catenin accumulates and associates with HIF1α and Src in human lung
adenocarcinomas

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test for the presence of pY654-β-catenin in human lung cancers, protein extracts of flash
frozen tumor tissues and matched contiguous normal lung tissues surgically dissected from
lung adenocarcinoma patients were analyzed by immunoblotting. pY654-β-catenin was
easily detected in all the tumor tissues but not in the contiguous normal tissues (Figure 1a,
top) although total β-catenin varied among the samples (Figure 1a, bottom). As observed in
prior studies of fibrosis (23), p-Smad2 co-precipitated with pY654-β-catenin in all of the
tumor specimens (Figure 1a). Several tyrosine kinases that are known to promote Y654-βcatenin phosphorylation including activated Src and EGFR (25), as well as activated and
total c-Met, were also upregulated in the tumor tissues compared to the matched normal
controls (Figure 1b and 1c). Further, both the EMT markers Snail1 and Twist as well as the
hypoxia marker HIF1α accumulated in these lung tumors (Figure 1b). To initially assess
whether there is a functional link between active Src, pY654-β-catenin, and EMT markers,
slices of fresh adenocarcinomas were cultured in vitro with or without Src kinase inhibitors
and then immunoblotted. The presence of pY654-β-catenin, active Src, and Snail1/Twist in
lysates from cultured fresh tumor slices (Figure S1) were all abrogated by the Src inhibitors
PP2 and SU6656, suggesting that Src family kinases play an important role in
phosphorylating β-catenin and the subsequent EMT.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because hypoxia-induced HIF1α has been shown to promote EMT and bind β-catenin (16,
32), we tested whether the tyrosine phosphorylated form of β-catenin preferentially interacts
with HIF1α. Indeed pY654-β-catenin immunoprecipitation co-precipitated HIF1α and Src
whereas sequential total β-catenin precipitates did not contain detectable HIF1α or Src
(Figure 1d), implying association with HIF1α and Src depends on pY654. Consistent with
this conclusion, immuno-depletion of HIF1α removed virtually all pY654-β-catenin from
tumor lysates (Figure 1e). To explore further the requirement for pY654 in the interaction of
β-catenin with HIF1α and its functional importance in tumor EMT we turned to model
systems.
Hypoxia induces pY654-β-catenin association with HIF1α/Src and increases EMT markers
in lung adenocarcinoma cells in a Src-dependent manner
We used human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H358 and A549 as ex vivo models to test
the role of HIF1α/pY654-β-catenin in hypoxia-stimulated EMT. After 2 or 12 hours
incubation under hypoxic conditions (1% O2), there was a robust increase of pY654-βcatenin and low levels of pY654-β-catenin/p-Smad2 complexes, reflecting the low basal
levels of p-Smad2 in H358 cells that is not altered by hypoxia (Figure 2a and S2a).
Exposure of H358 cells to hypoxia increased HIF1α protein level (Figure 2b and S2b, right)
and Src activity (Figure 2c). HIF1α and Src were detected in pY654-β-catenin IP from cells
exposed to hypoxia but not from cells cultured under normoxia or from hypoxic cells treated
with Src inhibitor SU6656 (Figure 2b and S2b, left). Again, there was no HIF1α and Src

discernible in the subsequent total β-catenin immunoprecipitates (Figure 2b and S2b,
middle) and HIF1α depletion removed all detectable pY654-β-catenin (Figure 2d and S2c),
similar to observations in human lung adenocarcinomas.
To further test whether pY654 is required for HIF1α and Src association, we stably
expressed Myc-tagged wt (W) or a non-phosphorylated Y654F mutant (F) β-catenin in H358
cells. Myc immunoprecipitates of these cells under hypoxic conditions confirmed that only
the wt but not the Y654F β-catenin associates with HIF1α and Src (Figure 2e). In additional
experiments we observed that over-expression of either wt or Y654F β-catenin in 293
fibroblastic cells resulted in comparable HIF1α/β-catenin interactions, consistent with direct
in vitro binding observed in a prior report (16). But at endogenous levels of HIF1α and βcatenin, at least in epithelial cells where the bulk of β-catenin is bound to E-cadherin, the
only species of β-catenin found in association with HIF1α is pY654-β-catenin. Generation of
this β-catenin species requires active Src kinase and presumably Y654 subsequently acts as a
binding site for Src SH2 domain, though we have not specifically addressed this point.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Active Src kinase(s) was also found to be required for hypoxia-induced EMT. Under
normoxia, lung cancer cells strongly expressed the epithelial marker E-cadherin at cell:cell
contacts and had little mesenchymal marker Fn staining, whereas cells cultured under
hypoxic conditions for 56 hours underwent clear morphological changes (Figure 2f and S2d,
top). This phenotype was reversed by SU6656 (Figure 2f and S2d, bottom). Immunoblotting
showed both hypoxia-induced Src activation and Snail1 expression were inhibited by
SU6656 (Figure 2c). While hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF1α does not require Src
activity (Figure 2c), knockdown of HIF1α completely blocked hypoxia-induced EMT in
H358 cells (Figure S3), indicating a critical role for both Src and HIF1α.
pY654-β-catenin and HIF1α act as a functional unit

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To address the functional importance of pY654-β-catenin in hypoxia-induced EMT we
utilized a T antigen-immortalized alveolar epithelial cell line homozygous for a floxed βcatenin allele, termed AECT. When plated onto Fn for 3 days AECTs activate latent TGFβ1
and undergo EMT as indicated by the induction of p-Smad2, loss of intact adherens
junctions, and induction of mesenchymal genes (24). To test whether TGFβ1 signaling is
required for hypoxia-induced EMT we treated cells with ALK5 inhibitor SB431542. As
expected, when these cells were exposed to hypoxia there was induction of HIF1α (Figure
3a) and pY654-β-catenin that was not blocked by ALK5 inhibitor (Figure S4a). All pY654β-catenin was again associated with HIF1α and this association was Src kinase dependent
(Figure 3a). Cells null for β-catenin were generated upon adenovirus-Cre exposure (AdCre). Under hypoxia, AECTs treated with Ad-Cre maintained an epithelial phenotype with
strong cell border staining of E-cadherin (green) whereas AECTs treated with control
adenovirus-GFP (Ad-GFP) completely lost cell:cell contact and border staining of Ecadherin (green) and β-catenin (red) (Figure 3b). The deletion of β-catenin also blocked
hypoxia-induced EMT biomarkers collagen I (Figure 3c), Twist (Figure 3d), as well as the
invasive metalloproteinase, MMP-2 (33), which was Src kinase dependent (Figure 3e).
Depletion of either β-catenin (Figure 3f) or HIF1α (Figure 3g) blocked collagen I and Snail
1 mRNA induction by hypoxia, indicating both β-catenin and HIF1α are functionally
important for hypoxia-induced EMT.
We next reconstituted the β-catenin null AECTs with wild-type or specific point mutants of
β-catenin to specifically assess the role of Y654. A Y654E mutation mimics its
phosphorylated form, while a Y654F mutation mimics the non-phosphorylated form of βcatenin (21). We verified that the Y654E mutant β-catenin was recognized by the pY654-βcatenin antibody (Figure S4b). Interestingly, Y654E mutant cells already show a
mesenchymal phenotype under normoxia as judged by disrupted border staining of EOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 December 24.

cadherin (green) and strong staining of EMT marker, α-SMA (orange) while Y654F mutant
cells maintain an epithelial phenotype (Figure 4a). When AECTs with β-catenin deletion
(Cre), wt β-catenin (W), and Y654E (E) or Y654F (F) mutant β-catenin were exposed to
hypoxia, Y654E mutant cells showed high levels of collagen I, 〈-SMA, Twist (Figure 4b) as
well as MMP-2 (Figure 4c) under both normoxia and hypoxia. While these markers were
significantly induced by hypoxia in WT cells, Y654F mutant cells failed to respond to
hypoxia, similar to the AECTs with ®-catenin deletion (Figure 4b–4d). Y654E-®-catenin
proved to be most efficient in EMT induction among different ®-catenin forms, as
illustrated by the EMT marker/®-catenin protein expression ratio quantified and pooled
from 3 independent experiments (Figure 4d).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine whether hypoxia-induced HIF1α transcriptional activity is regulated by the
phosphorylation status of Y654, we transfected a HRE reporter construct into 293 cells
expressing either wt (W), Y654E (E) or Y654F (F) mutant ®-catenin (Figure 4e, left). Under
hypoxia, non-transfected cells expressing only endogenous ®-catenin had ~10-fold increase
in luciferase activity. The ratio of hypoxia/normoxia for these cells was assigned a value of
1. Either wt or Y654E mutant cells showed 3–4-fold higher HRE activity over nontransfected cells whereas the HRE activity of Y654F mutant cells (Figure 4e, right) were no
different than non-transfected controls. These findings demonstrate that Y654
phosphorylation directly promotes HIF1α transcriptional activity, consistent with our
findings of ®-catenin/HIF1α-dependent induction of mRNA for EMT genes (Figure 3).
Interestingly, in addition to EMT genes, a number of other classical HIF1α responsive genes
(Figure S5a) were also found to be sensitive to Src activity (Figure S5b) and β-catenin
expression (Figure S5c). Taken together, these data indicate that tumor cell responses to
hypoxia that depend on upregulated HIF1α activity also require association of HIF1α with
pY654-®-catenin for a full transcriptional response.
ROS activity is required for hypoxia-induced tyrosine kinase activation, β-catenin
phosphorylation, and subsequent EMT

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In some cell systems hypoxia is reported to generate ROS that can then lead to Src
activation and EMT (32, 34). Indeed hypoxia significantly increased ROS activity in H358
cells (Figure 5a) and A549 cells (Figure S6a) as measured by fluorescence response of 3’(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (APF) (35). Both ROS inhibitors EUK-134 and/or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited hypoxia-induced Src activation and pY654-β-catenin formation in
H358 cells (Figure 5b) and A549 cells (Figure S6b). In contrast, Src activation and pY654β-catenin formation initiated by TGFβ1 signaling (24) were unaffected by ROS inhibitors
(Figure 5b and S6b). Notably, HIF1α expression levels were suppressed by ROS inhibitor(s)
in H358 cells (Figure 5b) but not in A549 cells (Figure S6b) indicating that pY654-βcatenin/HIF1α complexes rather than HIF1α levels alone track with EMT and its
suppression by ROS inhibitors.
Hypoxia-induced activation of EGFR and c-Met was blocked by ROS inhibitors (Figure S7a
and S7b) as well as Src inhibition (Figure S7c and S7d), implying that the activation of these
receptor tyrosine kinases is triggered by hypoxia-increased ROS activity, but is also
downstream of Src activation. Longer exposure of H358 cells to hypoxia confirmed that
hypoxia-induced Snail1 (Figure 5c), the invasive marker MMP-9 (Figure 5d), and wound
closure (Figure S8) were all dependent on ROS activity. Collectively, these findings indicate
that hypoxia-induced ROS leads to activation of Src kinase(s) and then EGFR and c-Met
activation that in turn further promotes Src activation and pY654-β-catenin accumulation.
These co-factors then cooperate with HIF1α to drive an invasive EMT program. We next
asked whether these ex vivo observations operate in vivo.

Anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies induce tumor hypoxia, pY654-β-catenin/HIF1α/Src
accumulation, and EMT in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In a mouse model of pancreatic islet carcinogenesis (RIP-Tag2), Casanovas and colleagues
reported that VEGF blockade in late-stage tumors resulted in hypoxia-mediated induction of
VEGF-independent proangiogenic factors (36). Sennino and colleagues recently reported
that anti-VEGF antibodies in this model led to both tumor EMT and marked tumor
invasiveness, including metastasis (37). We therefore addressed our ex vivo findings in the
RIP-Tag2 model. When 14-week old RIP-Tag2 mice were treated with a goat anti-VEGF
antibody or control IgG daily for a week, there was marked pY654-β-catenin as well as
HIF1α accumulation with the anti-VEGF antibody but not the controls (Figure 6a–6c). We
also noted that p-Smad2 was associated with pY654-β-catenin in the tumor lysates, similar
to human lung tumors (Figure 1), but anti-VEGF antibodies had no discernible effect on pSmad2 levels (Figure 6a). All or virtually all pY654-β-catenin induced by anti-VEGF in
these tumors was complexed with HIF1α and Src (Figure 6b). Western blot analysis
confirmed upregulation of active Src, N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail1, and Twist by antiVEGF antibody treatment (Figure 6c), indicating activation of an EMT program. Thus there
is a strong correlation between anti-VEGF induced-hypoxia, pY654-β-catenin/HIF1α
generation, and EMT reprogramming in the RIP-Tag2 tumor model.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally we asked whether anti-VEGF induced pY654-β-catenin/HIF1α/Src activation and
EMT in this model require ROS. Fourteen-week old RIP-Tag2 mice were concurrently
treated with goat anti-VEGF antibody and the antioxidant NAC or control buffer daily for
4–5 days. Co-immunostaining of E-cadherin (red) and the RIP-Tag2 tumor cell marker
insulin (green) revealed marked diminution of E-cadherin staining by antibody treatment
and the antibody effect was reversed by NAC treatment (Figure 7a). Consistent with
abrogation of the EMT program, pancreatic tumors in mice concurrently given NAC had
sharp borders (Figure 7a and S9), typical of the adenomas prior to acquiring an invasive
phenotype. Concurrent immunoblotting indicated that overall protein levels of E-cadherin
did not decrease in the tumor specimens (Figure 6c) only the intensity of staining which
reflects the loss of integrity of adherens junctions (37). Consistent with this finding, the
margins of the tumors were more irregular and interlaced with pancreatic tissue in antiVEGF treated mice (Figure 7a). We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the total Ecadherin protein in tumors of the anti-VEGF treated mice derives from normal pancreatic
tissue infiltrated by the tumors. In contrast, the anti-VEGF antibody-enhanced pY654-βcatenin/HIF1α, EMT markers, Src activity and phospho-c-Met (Figure 7b–7e) were all
reversed by NAC treatment. Reduced HIF1α is consistent with its reported stabilization by
ROS (10).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Discussion
In this study we identify a transcriptional complex that coordinates HIF1α and β-catenin
signaling as a function of hypoxia-induced ROS and Src kinase activation. The data reported
here indicate that activity of the HIF1α/pY654-β-catenin complex, over either element
alone, promotes tumor cell acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype both in vitro and in
vivo. These findings provide a conceptual paradigm that extends prior studies of HIF1α, βcatenin, and Src kinase in tumor invasion and metastasis by linking the function of each
element, and the complex as a whole, to the presence of hypoxia-induced ROS (Figure 8).
Whereas β-catenin transcriptional activity as a function of Wnt-induced or mutation-based
cytoplasmic stabilization mainly promotes epithelial proliferation (20), tyrosine
phosphorylation of β-catenin switches β-catenin to an interaction with HIF1α that promotes
mesenchymal transition. Interestingly, the interaction of pY654-β-catenin with HIF1α is
required for a full transcriptional response of multiple HIF1α responsive genes to hypoxia
(Figure S5). The levels of pY654-β-catenin, and therefore HIF1α/pY654-β-catenin

complexes, could be expected to rise if Wnt signaling is superimposed on hypoxia(24),
though hypoxia per se has little or no impact on Wnt activity in human lung adenocarcinoma
cell lines (Figure S10a). The failure of β-catenin complexed with HIF1α to signal via the
classical Wnt pathway has been previously noted (16), though the requirement and
consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation were not evaluated. Overall, β-catenin appears to
be at the center of intersecting signaling pathways that collectively determine the response
of tumor cells to a hypoxic microenvironment. These findings provide further mechanistic
insight into the established association between hypoxia and tumor invasion and highlight a
pathway of acquisition of tumor invasiveness that, while involving activation of tyrosine
kinases, operates through common features of a solid tumor without invoking acquisition of
new driver mutations. This conclusion is consistent with the lack of evidence for metastasis
as representing simply a genetic evolution of the primary tumor (31, 38).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Prior studies demonstrate that HIF1α can directly promote EMT, at least in part through
binding HIF response elements in the Twist and Snail1 promoters (14). Expression of
HIF2α promotes lung tumorigenesis and EMT in a mutant K-Ras mouse model (39) and
HIF1α expression levels correlate with tumor progression in several human cancers,
including NSCLC (6). As reported here, HIF1α accumulation is prominent both in primary
human lung adenocarcinomas and in experimentally induced tumor hypoxia (Figure 1 and
6), co-existing with markers of EMT including up-regulation of Twist and Snail1. However
our analysis of hypoxia- and HIF1α-dependent EMT in three independent cell systems
indicate the promoting effects of HIF1α on EMT require association with pY654-β-catenin.
Expression of a phosphorylation mimic of β-catenin enhanced HIF1α promoter activity 3–4fold over that of native β-catenin whereas a non-phosphorylatible form of β-catenin was
without effect. In vivo, accumulation of HIF1α and pY654-β-catenin developed in parallel
in mice bearing pancreatic tumors and exposed to anti-VEGF antibodies. Accumulation of
both proteins, along with evidence of EMT, abated in response to ROS inhibitors.
Collectively our findings invite the view that at least in epithelial cells HIF1α and pY654-βcatenin act as a functional signaling unit. If so, this concept implies determinants of Src
kinase activity are also intrinsically linked to HIF1α signaling.

Of particular interest is the activation state of c-Met in the RIP-Tag2 tumors from mice
treated with anti-VEGF antibodies. Activation of c-Met was recently reported to be crucial
to anti-VEGF antibody-induced EMT and metastasis in the RIP-Tag2 tumor model (37). In
our studies c-Met activation was ROS and Src kinase dependent both ex vivo and in vivo
(Figure 5 and 7). An alternative mechanism for anti-VEGF mediated c-Met activation was
recently reported in neuroblastoma cells. VEGF-dependent accumulation of the tyrosine
phosphatase PTP1B in complexes of c-Met and VEGF receptors acts as a brake on c-Met
activation. Anti-VEGF antibodies enhanced c-Met activation by attenuating phosphatase
activity near the c-Met receptors (40). These mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive as
the active site cysteines in a number of tyrosine phosphatases, including PTP1B, are known
to be targeted by ROS (41). We speculate that hypoxia induced ROS may effect c-Met
activation both by activation of Src leading to ligand independent activation of c-Met and
ROS-dependent PTP1B phosphatase inhibition, further supporting c-Met activation.
Prior studies have identified Wnt-independent signaling events operating through tyrosine
phosphorylation of β-catenin. For example, EGFR-dependent Src kinase activation leads to
pY333-β-catenin that promotes its association with the glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase
M2. This β-catenin complex was shown to translocate to the nucleus and promote
proliferation through a classical Wnt target gene, cyclin D1 (42). Whether Y654-β-catenin is
phosphorylated in this signaling cascade is unclear. We have previously reported TGFβ1dependent Src kinase activation leading to pY654-β-catenin and its association with pSmad2. Formation of pY654-β-catenin/p-Smad2 complexes promoted EMT of kidney and

lung alveolar epithelial cells (22, 23). Activation of Src kinase through hypoxia and TGFβ1
signaling is distinct because the former is critically dependent on ROS whereas TGFβ1mediated Src activation is not affected by ROS inhibitors (Figure 5b). In vivo, as judged by
co-immunoprecipitation experiments in extracts of human lung adenocarcinomas (Figure 1),
both p-Smad2 and HIF1α are found in association with pY654-β-catenin, indicating both
pathways likely contribute to EMT within lung cancers. This conclusion is supported by
experiments in vitro with H358 cells that indicate although ROS-dependent pY654-β-catenin
formation is critical to an EMT response under hypoxic conditions, activation of TGFβ1
signaling further promotes the response (Figure S10b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Hypoxia and overexpression of HIF-1α have been associated with radiation therapy and
chemotherapy resistance, an increased risk of invasion and metastasis, and a poor clinical
prognosis of solid tumors (7). Similarly, a hypoxia-induced invasive phenotype and
increased metastasis has been reported to result from anti-angiogenic treatment in preclinical
models (8, 9) (5). The administration of anti-VEGF antibodies to mice bearing RIP-Tag2
pancreatic tumors was recently reported to result in both hypoxia-induced tumor EMT and
enhanced hepatic metastases (37). Here we demonstrate activation of the HIF1α/pY654-βcatenin pathway in this model, the presence of EMT, and its dependence on ROS generation.
This problem is also potentially a complication of anti-angiogenic therapy in humans and
may contribute to the marginal survival benefits reported for such therapy in colon, breast,
and lung cancer treatments (43). Neuroblastomas appear particular prone to acquire invasive
properties in the presence of anti-VEGF induced tumor hypoxia (44). Indeed in preliminary
studies we have observed marked activation of pY654-β-catenin in brain biopsies of patients
progressing on Avastin when compared with the initial tumors (44) (Figure S11). Our data
thus provide new information that is potentially clinically relevant. The finding that
hypoxia-induced invasiveness in vivo can be markedly attenuated by concurrent
administration of the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (Figure 7) raises the possibility that
blockade of hypoxia induced ROS accumulation, likely from mitochondrial sources (34) or
administration of this or other anti-oxidants could attenuate the invasive switch that is
apparently experienced by some patients receiving anti-angiogenic adjunctive therapy.

supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% FBS (Hyclone). Stable cell line of H358 that express
wt or Y654F β-catenin were established by infection of lentivirus and selected by
puromycin. T antigen immortalized mouse lung alveolar epithelial cells (AECTs) were
generated as previously described (24) and were maintained on Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
in small airway growth medium (SAGM, Lonza, Wakersville, MD) supplemented with 5%
FBS and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). For experiments, cells were incubated with
Adenovirus-Cre (50 pfu/cell) to delete β-catenin or with control Adenovirus-GFP. AECTs
expressing various forms of β-catenin were generated as previously described (24).
Tissue samples
Fresh or frozen tumor and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from patients with lung
adenocarcinomas who were undergoing surgical resection of the primary tumor. The study
was approved by the University of California San Francisco, Institutional Review Board
(IRB#: 10-00959).

Animals and treatment

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor-bearing RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background) (14 weeks old) were
treated for 1 week with normal goat IgG or function-blocking goat anti-mouse VEGF
antibody (150 µg in 50 µL sterile PBS) injected ip three times. Some mice were concurrently
treated with NAC (1g/kg/day by gavage) for 4–5 days. Body weight and survival were
recorded during the treatment period. All animal procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UCSF.

Schematic diagram illustrating central role for ROS and Src in hypoxia-induced pY654-βcatenin/HIF1α formation and tumor EMT. Hypoxia exposure generates reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and stabilizes HIF1α (10). Increased ROS activity results in the activation of
Src family kinase(s) (p-Src) (45) that then promotes activation of tyrosine kinases such as
EGFR and c-Met, further promoting p-Src. Active Src phosphorylates β-catenin at Y654,
favoring β-catenin association with HIF1α over β-catenin degradation, binding to Ecadherin, or association with TCFs in the Wnt pathway. pY654-β-catenin/HIF1α complexes
promote transcription of EMT genes as well as other hypoxia responsive genes. Although
not shown, Src is also in complexes of pY654-β-catenin/HIF1α. TGFβ1 signaling is not
enhanced by hypoxia but remains active within the tumor microenvironment and further
promotes hypoxia-induced EMT.
