ABSTRACT
The orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 is expressed in tumors from
rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) patients and Rh30 and RD RMS cell lines, and we used RNA
interference (RNAi) to investigate the role of this receptor in RMS cells. Knockdown
of NR4A1 in Rh30 cells decreased cell proliferation, induced Annexin V staining and
induced polyADPribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and these results were similar
to those observed in other solid tumors. Previous studies show that NR4A1 regulates
expression of growth promoting/pro-survival genes with GC-rich promoters, activates
mTOR through suppression of p53, and maintains low oxidative stress by regulating
expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and thioredoxin domain containing
5 (TXNDC5). Results of RNAi studies demonstrated that NR4A1 also regulates these
pathways and associated genes in RMS cells and thereby exhibits pro-oncogenic
activity. 1,1-Bis(3-indolyl)-1-(p-substituted phenyl)methane (C-DIM) analogs
containing p-hydroxyl (DIM-C-pPhOH) and p-carboxymethyl (DIM-C-pPhCO2Me)
substituents are NR4A1 ligands that decreased NR4A1-dependent transactivation in
RMS cells and inhibited RMS cell and tumor growth and induced apoptosis. Moreover,
the effects of NR4A1 knockdown and the C-DIM/NR4A1 antagonists were comparable
as inhibitors of NR4A1-dependent genes/pathways. Both NR4A1 knockdown and
treatment with DIM-C-pPhOH and DIM-C-pPhCO2Me also induced ROS which activated
stress genes and induced sestrin 2 which activated AMPK and inhibited mTOR in the
mutant p53 RMS cells. Since NR4A1 regulates several growth-promoting/pro-survival
pathways in RMS, the C-DIM/NR4A1 antagonists represent a novel mechanism-based
approach for treating this disease alone or in combination and thereby reducing the
adverse effects of current cytotoxic therapies.

INTRODUCTION

survival of patients with metastatic ERMS is only 40%
[3]. ARMS occurs in a lower percentage of RMS patients
and is associated with translocations resulting in formation
of pro-oncogenic gene products resulting from the fusion
of PAX3 or PAX7 with the Forkhead gene FOXO1A [5, 6].
ARMS patients have a poor diagnosis and patient survival
is < 10% for metastatic ARMS.
RMS patients are treated with radiotherapy,
surgery, and chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs and/or
drug combinations, and successful treatment varies with
tumor type (ARMS vs. ERMS) and extent of metastasis.
However, a recent study on adults treated for childhood
cancers showed that over 90% of these individuals

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common
soft tissue sarcoma that is primarily observed in children
and adolescents and accounts for 5% of all pediatric
cancers and 50% of soft tissue sarcomas in children
[1, 2]. Embryonal RMS (ERMS) and alveolar RMS
(ARMS) are the two major classes of RMS in children
and adolescents and differ with respect to their histology,
genetics, treatment, and prognosis [1–4]. ERMS accounts
for over 60% of RMS patients and is associated with loss
of heterozygosity at the 11p15 locus. ERMS patients
have a favorable initial prognosis; however, the overall

exhibited chronic adverse health conditions later in life [7],
demonstrating that there is a critical need for development
of new mechanism-based drugs for treatment of RMS.
The orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1, Nur77/
TR3) does not have an endogenous ligand; however,
this receptor plays a key role in cellular homeostasis and
in several diseases including cancer [8, 9]. NR4A1 is
overexpressed in lung, breast, pancreatic and colon cancer
patients [9–13], and functional studies show that NR4A1 is
pro-oncogenic and plays a role in cancer cell proliferation,
survival, migration and invasion [reviewed in 9]. Several
structurally-diverse ligands that directly bind NR4A1 have
been characterized [14–17] and studies in this laboratory
have shown that among a series of 1,1-bis(3-indolyl)1-(p-substituted phenyl)methanes (C-DIMs), several
compounds including the p-hydroxy (DIM-C-pPhOH)
and p-carbomethoxy (DIM-C-pPhCO2Me) analogs
directly bind NR4A1 (Figure 1A). Results of RNA
interference (RNAi) studies show that NR4A1 activates
mTOR by binding and inactivating p53 [12], regulates
genes such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and
thioredoxin domain-containing 5 (TXNDC5) to decrease
cellular stress [18], and regulates expression of growth
promoting/survival genes such as survivin and epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) through NR4A1-Sp1
interactions with their proximal GC-rich promoter
elements [19]. The pro-oncogenic NR4A1-regulated
activities have previously been characterized in colon,
lung and pancreatic cancer cells [12, 16, 18, 19], and the
C-DIM/NR4A1 antagonists inhibited these pathways
(Figure 1B) and gave results comparable to those observed
for RNA interference (RNAi). In preliminary data mining
studies, we observed that NR4A1 was also overexpressed
in RMS tumors compared to normal tissue and high
levels were observed in prototypical ARMS (Rh30) and
ERMS (RD) cell lines. This study also demonstrates that
NR4A1 regulates pro-oncogenic pathways (Figure 1B) in
RMS cells and C-DIM/NR4A1 antagonists inhibit these
responses, demonstrating that NR4A1 is a potential novel
target for RMS chemotherapy.

transfected with constructs containing the DNA binding
domain of the yeast GAL4 protein fused to NR4A1 and
the UASX5 luc construct containing 5 GAL4 response
elements, and treatment with DIM-C-pPhOH or DIMC-pPhCO2Me decreased luciferase activity (Figure 1D).
DIM-C-pPhOH and DIM-C-pPhCO2Me also decreased
luciferase activity in RD cells transfected with NBRE3luc and NuRE3-luc constructs containing 3 binding sites
for NR4A1 monomer and homodimer, respectively
(Figure 1D). Basal activity was low for both constructs
but significantly enhanced by cotransfection with a
FLAG-TR3 expression plasmid in RD cells. These results
were comparable to those previously observed in colon
cancer cells [16] and demonstrate that the two C-DIM
compounds exhibit antagonist activity for transactivation
in RD cells. Immunostaining of Rh30 and RD cells with
DAPI and NR4A1 antibodies showed that NR4A1 was
nuclear in these RMS cell lines (Figure 1E). Moreover,
the u = mu (micro) after treatment with 20 uM DIM-CpPhOH for 24 hr, we did not observe any nuclear export
of NR4A1 which was comparable to observations in other
cancer cell lines [12, 16, 18, 19].

Role of NR4A1 in RMS cell growth and survival
Transfection of Rh30 and RD cells with siNR4A1
significantly decreased proliferation of Rh30 and RD
cells and comparable results were observed for two
different siRNAs (Figure 2A). Treatment of Rh30 cells
with 7.5 to 22.5 mM DIM-C-pPhOH and 5 to 15 mM
DIM-C-pPhCO2Me of the NR4A1 antagonists for 24 hr
also inhibited growth of RH30 (Figure 2B) and RD
(Figure 2C) cells with IC50 values ranging from 6.6 to
29  mM. Figure 2D also shows that although inhibition
of RD cell growth after treatment with 15 mM DIM-CpPhCO2Me was only 20–25%, after prolonged treatment
(48 and 72 hr), more complete growth inhibition was
observed. In addition, we also observed that DIM-CpPhOH (40 mg/kg/d) inhibited tumor growth in athymic
nude mice bearing Rh30 cells as xenografts (Figure 2E).
We also investigated the role of NR4A1 in mediating
survival of Rh30 and RD cells, and Figure 3A shows that
transfection of these cells with siNR4A1 resulted in the
induction of Annexin V staining. Moreover, transfection
of Rh30 and RD cells with siNR4A1 also induced
PARP cleavage, another marker of apoptosis in these
cells (Figure 3B). Treatment of Rh30 and RD cells with
the NR4A1 antagonists DIM-C-pPhOH and DIM-CpPhCO2Me also induced Annexin V staining (Figure 3C)
and PARP cleavage (Figure 3D), thus confirming the prosurvival activity of NR4A1 in RMS cells and effects of
C-DIM/NR4A1 antagonists as inhibitors of cell growth
and survival.

RESULTS
NR4A1 expression and transactivation
Examination of publically-available RMS array
data show that NR4A1 mRNA is more highly expressed
in RMS tumors compared to non-tumor tissue (Figure 1C).
Previous studies show that the C-DIM compounds DIMC-pPhOH and DIM-C-pPhCO2Me bind NR4A1 and
act as NR4A1 antagonists for transactivation assays in
colon cancer cells [16] and therefore these compounds
were also used in this study on RMS cells. RD cells were

NR4A1 antagonists inhibit growth/survival
pathways and gene products in RMS cells

pPhCO2Me also decreased expression of TXNDC5 and
IDH1 mRNA levels (Figure 5F). The induction of ROS
by inactivation of NR4A1 also has functional significance
since DIM-C-pPhOH-induced cleavage of PARP, caspases
3 and 7 (markers of apoptosis), and growth inhibition
were significantly reversed after cotreatment with 5 mm
glutathione (GSH) (Supplementary Figure S1).
NR4A1 binds and inactivates p53 (Figure 1B)
and knockdown of NR4A1 or treatment with NR4A1
antagonists results in p53-dependent induction of sestrin
2, an upstream regulator of AMPKa in lung and colon
cancer cells [12, 16]. Even though Rh30 and RD cells
are p53-negative; knockdown of NR4A1 in Rh30 cells
or treatment with DIM-C-pPhOH induced sestrin 2 and
increased phosphorylation of AMPKa and this resulted in
decreased activation of mTOR-dependent phosphorylation
of both 4EBP1 and 6SRP which are kinases downstream
from mTOR (Figure 6A). Similar results were observed in
RD cells (Supplementary Figure S2A) and after treatment
with DIM-C-pPhCO2Me (Supplementary Figure S2B).
Sestrin 2 is also induced in response to ROS [20] and since
C-DIM/NR4A1 antagonists induce ROS (Figure 5B), the
effects of the antioxidant GSH as an inhibitor of sestrin
2 induction after NR4A1 inactivation was investigated.
Sestrin 2 induction in RD and Rh30 cells treated with
DIM-C-pPhOH or DIM-C-pPhCO2Me was attenuated after
cotreatment with GSH (Figure 6B) and similar results were
observed after NR4A1 knockdown (Figure 6C). DIM-CpPhCO2Me also induced sestrin 2 gene expression in Rh30
and RD cells (Figure 6D), and the induction response
was attenuated in cells cotreated with the antioxidant
GSH (Figure 6E). Thus, the NR4A1 antagonists block
at least three NR4A1-regulated pro-oncogenic pathways
(Figure 1B) in RMS cells indicating that NR4A1 is a
potential new drug target for treatment of RMS.

Previous studies show that NR4A1 acts as a
coactivator of genes with GC-rich promoters (Figure 1B,
pathway 3) that play a role in cancer cell proliferation
and survival, and these include survivin, bcl-2, cyclin D1,
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the oncogene
cMyc [16, 19]. Knockdown of NR4A1 by RNA in Rh30
and RD cells decreased expression of several genes with
GC-rich promoters including EGFR, bcl2, c-Myc and
cyclin D1, and this was accompanied by minimal effects
on expression of Sp1 (Figure 4A). Treatment of Rh30 and
RD cells with the NR4A1 antagonists DIM-C-pPhOH
(Figure 4B) and DIM-C-pPhCO2Me (Figure 4C) also
decreased expression of survivin, bcl-2, cyclin D1, EGFR
and cMyc, and these results paralleled those observed after
knockdown of NR4A1 in these cells lines (Figure 4A).
DIM-C-pPhCO2Me was used to further investigate the
mechanism of downregulation of Sp-regulated genes
at the transcriptional level. In a ChIP assay, DIM-CpPhCO2Me decreased binding of NR4A1 and p300 (but
not Sp1) at the GC-rich region of the survivin promoter
and pol II binding was also decreased (Figure 4D). These
results are comparable to previous studies in pancreatic
cancer cells showing that p300/NR4A1 coregulated
survivin expression by interacting with DNA-bound Sp1
(Figure 1B) [19]. In addition, DIM-C-pPhCO2Me also
decreased expression of survivin, cyclin D1 and EGFR
mRNA levels (Figure 4E). Thus, NR4A1 also coregulates
expression of Sp-regulated pro-survival/growth promoting
genes with GC-rich promoters in RMS cells.
NR4A1 also regulates expression of TXNDC5
and IDH1 to maintain low oxidative and endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress [16, 18], and transfection of Rh30
and RD cells with siNR4A1 induced ROS as determined
using the cell permeable fluorescent indicator CMH2DCFDA (Figure 5A) and similar results were observed
after treatment with the NR4A1 antagonists (Figure 5B).
Knockdown of NR4A1 (Figure 5C) or treatment of Rh30
and RD cells with the NR4A1 antagonists (Figure 5D)
decreased expression of TXNDC5 and IDH1 and this
was accompanied by induction of several markers of ER
stress including phosphorylated PERK (pPerk), ATF4 and
CHOP. Both TXNDC5 and IDH1 have GC-rich promoter
sequences at -22 and -112, respectively, in untreated
cells, and a ChIP assay showed binding of NR4A1,
Sp1 and p300 to the GC-rich regions of the promoter
in Rh30 cells (Figure 5E). Treatment of these cells with
the NR4A1 antagonist DIM-C-pPhCO2Me resulted in
decreased interactions of NR4A1, p300 and pol II with
the GC-rich TXNDC5 and IDH1 promoters and also some
loss of Sp1 from the TXNDC5 promoter, suggesting that
like survivin, expression of these genes also involves
interaction of the p300/NR4A1 complex with Sp1 at
GC-rich elements (Figure 1B). In addition, DIM-Cwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DISCUSSION
The NR4A orphan nuclear receptors are immediate
early genes induced by multiple stressors and there is
increasing evidence that these receptors play a critical role
in maintaining cellular homeostasis in multiple tissues and
organs [8]. There is evidence that NR4A1 is important in
metabolism and metabolic disease, cardiovascular and
neuronal function, and inflammation in multiple tissues
[8]. The function and mechanism of action of NR4A1
in cancer cells is complex; transgenic mice in which
both NR4A1 and NR4A3 (Nurr1) have been knocked
out rapidly develop an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
type of leukemia and there is evidence that NR4A1 is a
tumor suppressor for AML [21, 22]. In contrast, NR4A1
is overexpressed in most solid tumors and is a negative
prognostic factor for lung, breast and colon cancer
patients and knockdown studies show that NR4A1 plays
a role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration and
invasion [9, 10, 23–27]. Early studies on drug-mediated

effects of NR4A1 demonstrated that many apoptosisinducing drugs that do not directly bind NR4A1 induce
nuclear export of this receptor which subsequently binds
to mitochondrial bcl-2 to form a pro-apoptotic complex
that disrupts mitochondria in cancer cells, resulting in
increased cell death (24, 25). However, more recently
cytosporone B and some structurally-related compounds
have been identified as NR4A1 ligands [14, 15, 17] and

studies in this laboratory have also identified C-DIMs
as NR4A1 receptor ligands and these compounds act as
NR4A1 antagonists that inhibit cancer cell growth and
survival by directly targeting nuclear NR4A1 [14–17].
NR4A1 is a nuclear protein expressed in RD
and Rh30 cells (Figure 1E), and there is evidence from
publically available array data from RMS tumors that
NR4A1 mRNA is overexpressed in tumor vs. non-tumor

tissue (Figure 1C). The functional role of NR4A1 in RMS
was investigated by RNAi showing that this receptor
plays a role in RMS cell proliferation and survival
(Figures 2 and 3) and these results are comparable to
those observed in many other solid tumors [reviewed
in 9]. NR4A1 knockdown studies also demonstrated
that NR4A1 also plays a role in activating mTOR and
maintaining low stress levels through its regulation

of TXNDC5 and IDH1 (Figure 5). Both IDH1 and
TXNDC5 are regulated by NR4A1 in pancreatic and
colon cancer cells, and knockdown of either NR4A1
or TXNDC5 in pancreatic cancer cells results in the
induction of ROS [18]. The results illustrated in Figure
5A and 5B show that knockdown of NR4A1 in RMS cells
also results in downregulation of TXNDC5 (and IDH1)
and induction of ROS and ER stress genes, confirming

that NR4A1 regulation of TXNDC5 suppresses ER and
oxidative stress. NR4A1 also regulates IDH1 expression
which also generates cellular reductants and complements
the function of TXNDC5 in terms of stress suppression
[20, 28]. In contrast to glioma and other cancer cells
which express IDH1 mutations [29] enhancing D-2hydroxyglutarate production, this mutation has not been

detected in RMS [30]. NR4A1-dependent maintenance
of low oxidative stress levels also contributes to mTOR
signaling since knockdown of NR4A1 results in oxidative
stress-dependent induction of sestrin 2 [31] which in turn
activates AMPKa and inhibits mTOR. Genomic analysis
coupled with high throughput screening of primary RMS
cultures identified ROS inducers as a therapeutically

relevant approach for treating ERMS [32]. Results of our
studies implicate NR4A1 regulation of TXNDC5 and
IDH1 for maintaining low oxidative stress in RD and
Rh30 cells and suppression of these gene by the C-DIM/
NR4A1 antagonists induces ROS which in turn induces
ER stress and also sestrin 2-dependent inhibition of mTOR
(Figures 5 and 6). Induction of this latter pathway may be
an important contributor to the efficacy of C-DIM/NR4A1
antagonists and other ROS-inducing agents since mTOR
inhibitors show promise as mechanism-based drugs for
RMS chemotherapy [33–35]. Moreover, Supplementary
Figure S1 also demonstrates that DIM-C-pPhOH-mediated
induction of ROS plays a major role in growth inhibition
and induction of apoptosis and this is due to the high
sensitivity of RMS cells to ROS-inducing compounds [32].
Nuclear receptors not only activate gene expression
through direct binding to their cognate response elements
but also indirectly through interactions with DNA-bound
transcription factors such as Sp1, and this has been
observed for several other nuclear hormone and orphan
receptors [36–42]. Similar results have previously been
reported for NR4A1 which coactivates expression of
growth-promoting and pro-survival genes with GCrich promoters through interactions of p300/NR4A1Sp1 bound to GC cis-elements [16, 19]. Knockdown of
NR4A1 decreases expression of several Sp1-regulated
genes (but not Sp1) including survivin, bcl-2, EGFR,
cyclin D1 and c-Myc in Rh30 and RD cells as observed
in other cancer cell lines and in this study, ChIP assays
indicated that not only survivin (Figure 4D) but also
TXNDC5 and IDH1 are regulated by interactions of p300/
NR4A1 with Sp1 bound to GC-rich promoters (Figure 1B).
A previous study reported that Sp1 is overexpressed
in RMS tumors and cells and Sp-regulated genes such
platelet-derived growth factor receptor a, hepatocyte
growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor
and CXCR4 are important for the oncogenic phenotype of
RMS [43]. Current studies using RNA-seq combined with
receptor knockdown are focused on the role of NR4A1
in regulating expression of these genes and other prooncogenic factors in RMS cells via pathway 3 (Figure 1B).
The important pro-oncogenic functions of NR4A1
in RMS cells indicate that antagonists of this receptor
represent a potential novel clinical approach for treating
RMS. DIM-C-pPhOH was initially characterized as an
inhibitor of NR4A1-dependent transactivation and recent
structure-binding studies demonstrate that DIM-C-pPhOH,
DIM-C-pPhCO2Me and other C-DIMs bind the ligand
binding domain of NR4A1 and exhibit NR4A1 antagonist
activity in colon cancer cells [16]. In RMS cells, we have
also observed parallel effects of NR4A1 knockdown and
treatment with DIM-C-pPhOH and DIM-C-pPhCO2Me,
demonstrating that C-DIM/NR4A1 antagonists represent
a new class of mechanism-based drugs for treating RMS.
This observation is particularly important for RMS

patients since their current treatment regimens rely on
cytotoxic drugs which lead to serious health problems later
in life [2, 7]

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, antibodies, chemicals, and other
materials
Rh30 and RD human RMS cancer cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA) and were maintained at 37°C in
the presence of 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 Medium or
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, respectively,
both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
5% antibiotic. Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium,
and RPMI-1640 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO), glutathione (GSH) reduced free acid
were purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA), and
Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen
(Grand Island, NY). Apoptotic, Necrotic, and Healthy
Cells Quantification Kit was purchased from Biotium
(Hayward, CA). Cells were subsequently viewed using a
filter set for FITC, rhodamine, and DAPI on an Advanced
Microscopy EVOS fl, fluorescence microscope. RGB4103 GelRed nucleic acid stain was used in place of
Ethedium Bromide from Phenix Research Products
(Candler, NC). The C-DIM compounds were prepared as
previously described [16] and a summary of the antibodies
are provided in Supplementary Table S1. A summary of
oligonucleotide for RNAi and real time PCR and ChIP
primers are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.

Total RNA expression analysis
Patient sample data of total RNA was acquired
from NCBI GEO dataset GSE28511 (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc = GSE28511) and
was previously analyzed for quality control, quantile
normalized. In addition, multi-probe genes were averaged
by the submitter. Expression values were listed into nontumor and RMS tumor groups in JMP® and a box plot was
generated, from which a t-test was performed; significance
was determined as a p-value less than 0.01, shown by an
asterisk.

Cell proliferation and tumor growth assay
Rh30 and RD cells were plated in 12-well plates at
1.0 × 105 and allowed to attached for 24 hr before treatment
with DIM-C-pPhOH, DIM-C-pPhCO2Me, or transfected
with siNR4A1, with DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as
empty vehicle or siCtl siRNA (with lipofectamine vehicle)
as controls, respectively. Cells were then trypsinized
and counted at indicated times using a Coulter Z1 cell

counter. Female athymic nude mice (6–8 weeks old) were
obtained (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA)
and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions,
and housed at Texas A&M University in accordance
with the standards of the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and the Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).
The protocol of the animal study was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Texas A&M
University. Rh30 cells (4 × 106 cells) grown in RPMI media
containing 10% FBS were detached, resuspended in 100 µl
of phosphate-buffered saline with matrigel (BD Bioscience,
Bedford, MA) (75:25), and implanted subcutaneously in
the mice. When tumors reached about 40–50 mm3 size, the
animals were randomized into control and treatment groups
(6 animals per group) and mice were treated with placebo or
DIM-C-pPhCO2Me (40 mg/kg/d) in corn oil by oral gavage
every second day for 20 days. Tumor volumes and weights,
and body weight were determined; the tumor size was
measured using Vernier calipers, and the tumor volume was
estimated by the formula: tumor volume (mm3) = (L × W2)
× ½, where L is the length and W is the width of the tumor.

transfected with siNR4A1, with DMSO as empty vehicle
or siCtl siRNA (with lipofectamine vehicle) as controls,
respectively. Cells were treated with C-DIMs or DMSO
for 48 hr or transfected with siNR4A1 (100 μM) or siCtl
for 72 hr, and Western blots of whole cell lysates were
determined as described [16].

Transactivation, real-time PCR, and chromatin
immunopricipitation (ChIP) assays
Real time PCR and ChIP assays using RMS
cell lines transfected with oligonucleotides or treated
with C-DIMs were carried out essentially as described
[12, 16, 18, 19], and the oligonucleotides and primers
used are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.
Transactivation studies were carried out in RD cells
transfected with two NR4A1-responsive constructs,
NuRE×3-luc and NBRE3-luc, that bind NR4A1 as a
homodimer or monomer, respectively, or transfected
with a GAL4-NR4A1 (chimera) and a GAL4-responsive
construct (UAS×5-luc) essentially as described [44]. Realtime PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
were carried out essentially as described [19].

Annexin V staining

Generation and measurement of ROS

Rh30 and RD cells were seeded in 2-well Lab-Tek
chambered B#1.0 Borosilicate coverglass slides from
Thermo Scientific and were allowed to attach for 24 hr
before treatment with C-DIMs or DMSO for 48 hr and
with siNR4A1 (100 μM) or siCtl for 72 hr, and Annexin V
staining was determined as described [16].

Cellular ROS levels were measured utilizing
a cell permeable probe, CM-H2DCFDA (5-(and-6)chloromethyl-2ʹ7ʹ-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
acetyl ester) from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). CMH2DCFDA diffuses into the cell, where its acetate
groups are cleaved by intracellular esterases and upon
oxidation, yields a fluorescent adduct that is measured
by flow cytometry using Accuri’s C6 Flow Cytometer
(Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were plated in a 6-well culture
plate and allowed to attach for 24 hr and treated for the
indicated time with DIM-C-pPhOH, DIM-C-pPhCO2Me,
or siNR4A1. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized,
neutralized, then loaded with 10 μM of probe for 20 min
incubation, and were washed with serum free media for
ROS quantification.

Immunofluorescence
Rh30 and RD cells were plated in seeded at
1.0 × 105 in 2-well Lab-Tek chambered B#1.0 Borosilicate
coverglass slides from Thermo Scientific and were allowed
to attach for 24 hr in DMEM/Ham F-12 containing 5.0%
charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and treated with
C-DIM compounds for 24 hr. Cells were then treated with
fluorescent NR4A1 antibody [Nurr77 (D63C5) XP®] and
the manufacturer’s protocol (Cell Signaling Technologies,
Danvers, MA) was used to observe immunofluorescence.
Hoechst staining from the apoptotic and necrotic cells assay
(Biotium, Hayward, CA) was used to visualize nuclear
DAPI staining, while NR4A1 localization was determined
by green fluorescence. Images were taken using an EVOS
fluorescence microscopy from Advance Microscopy;
NR4A1 and DAPI images were subsequently merged.

Statistics
Results for each treatment group were replicated
(at least 3X) and expressed a means ± SE. Statistical
comparisons of the treated groups vs. a control for each
treatment were determined using Student’s t-test.
