Abstract
Cdc25A propels cell cycle progression, is overexpressed in
numerous human cancers, and possesses oncogenic and
antiapoptotic activities. Reactive oxygen species, such as
hydrogen peroxide, regulate Cdc25A, but the physiologic and
pathologic effects of nitric oxide (.NO) and .NO-derived
reactive species are not well defined. Herein, we report novel
independent mechanisms governing Cdc25A in response to
nitrosative insult. We observed direct and rapid inhibition
of Cdc25A phosphatase activity after in vitro treatment
with the low molecular mass cell-permeable S-nitrosothiol
S-nitrosocysteine ethyl ester (SNCEE). In addition, treatment of
cancer cells with SNCEE induced nitrosative stress and
decreased Cdc25A protein levels in a time-dependent and
concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, iNOS-derived .NO
was sufficient to suppress Cdc25A expression, consistent with
its role in mediating nitrosative stress. Whereas a decrease in
Cdc25A half-life was not observed in response to SNCEE, we
found the translational regulator eukaryotic initiation factor
2A (eIF2A) was hyperphosphorylated and total protein translation was decreased with kinetics consistent with Cdc25A loss.
Inhibition of eIF2A decreased Cdc25A levels, supporting the
hypothesis that SNCEE suppressed Cdc25A translation through
inhibition of eIF2A. Nitrosative stress decreased the Cdc25Abound fraction of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1)
and sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by the ASK-1–
activating chemotherapeutic cis-diaminedichloroplatinum
(II), suggesting that nitrosative stress–induced suppression of
Cdc25A primed cells for ASK-1–dependent apoptosis. Together
these data reveal novel .NO-dependent enzymatic and translational mechanisms controlling Cdc25A, and implicate Cdc25A
as a mediator of .NO-dependent apoptotic signaling. [Cancer

Introduction
It is well accepted that the Cdc25 dual-specificity phosphatases
catalyze progression through the cell cycle by dephosphorylating
and activating the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk; ref. 1). The three
mammalian isoforms, Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C, cumulatively
contribute to progression into and through mitosis by dephosphorylating the Cdk1/cyclin B complex. Recent evidence suggests
these phosphatases act on distinctly localized cellular pools of Cdk
substrates and other currently unidentified substrates to control
the timing and distribution of mitotic activities (2, 3). Whereas

mitotic progression is a cumulative effort by these phosphatases,
Cdc25A is the primary regulator of the G1-S transition and S-phase
progression via activation of Cdk2 complexes (1). Cdc25A is
overexpressed in numerous human cancers (4) and suppresses
apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting apoptosis signal-regulating
kinase-1 (ASK-1; ref. 5). Cdc25A overexpression also drives aberrant
progression through the G1-S transition (1), induces DNA damage
(6), and promotes radioresistant DNA synthesis in irradiated cells
(7). Thus, understanding mechanisms controlling Cdc25A levels
and activity are of basic biological and therapeutic interest.
The observation that oxidants regulate the activity of the Cdc25
phosphatases provides a potential linkage between cell redox
status and cell cycle progression. In vitro, H2O2 inhibits Cdc25
activity by oxidation of the catalytic cysteine (8). The Cdc25C
catalytic cysteine is oxidized to an intramolecular disulfide in
H2O2-treated cells, although the impact of this phosphatase
inactivation on cell cycle regulation remains unclear (9). H2O2
also decreases Cdc25A expression in HeLa cells, although the
mechanism remains unidentified (10).
The effects of .NO and other reactive .NO-derived species
(RNS) on Cdc25A are even less well defined, although they are
physiologically and pathologically important. Cdc25A expression
decreases in response to the nitrating agents .NO2 and SIN-1 (11).
The loss of Cdc25A is okadaic acid–sensitive and parallels ATM
kinase hyperphosphorylation, which decreases Cdc25A protein
half-life through activation of Chk2, subsequent Cdc25A phosphorylation, and proteasomal degradation (7). This study however did
not examine the effects of .NO or S-nitrosating agents on Cdc25A.
.NO is a diatomic free radical, generated by nitric oxide
synthases (NOS), which acts as a signaling molecule in numerous
critical cellular processes, including vasodilation, synaptic transmission, and inflammation. Vasodilation and synaptic transmission
are generally modulated by the production of low quantities of
.NO by eNOS and nNOS, respectively. Inflammatory responses,
bacterial infection, and tumorigenesis induce the production of
greater concentrations of iNOS-derived .NO and secondary nitrosating, nitrating, and oxidizing species (12–14). Production of high
quantities of .NO by iNOS induces nitrosative stress, which is
characterized by failure to regulate the concentration of intracellular nitroso-species (15, 16). Expression of iNOS is observed
in both cancerous tissues and precancerous lesions of chronic
inflammatory diseases (13).
Generation of protein-associated S-nitroso species or S-nitrosation has recently gained attention as a cellular signaling
mechanism (17). S-nitrosation is a reversible modification capable
of altering protein function and cell signaling. Thus, understanding
the cellular targets of protein S-nitrosation in cells may define
effects of nitrosative stress in vivo. We therefore aimed to
characterize the role of nitrosative stimuli on Cdc25A activity in
cancer cells.
We now report biochemical mechanisms regulating Cdc25A in
response to nitrosative insult. S-nitrosothiols rapidly inhibited the
in vitro phosphatase activity of Cdc25A toward both artificial and

endogenous substrates. Induction of cellular nitrosative stress
using the cell-permeable nitrosating agent S -nitrosothiol
S-nitrosocysteine ethyl ester (SNCEE) suppressed Cdc25A protein
levels via hyperphosphorylation and inhibition of the translational
regulator eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a). Generation of
.NO from iNOS also decreased Cdc25A protein levels, consistent
with a role of iNOS in nitrosative stress induction. Nitrosative stress
decreased the Cdc25A-bound fraction of ASK-1 and synergized with
cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) to induce apoptotic cell
death, consistent with a model where Cdc25A suppression by
nitrosative stress primes cells for ASK-1–mediated cell death.
Together, these results describe blunting of Cdc25A levels and
activity in response to nitrosative insult and implicate Cdc25A
suppression as a cellular priming event for ASK-1–dependent
apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatments. HCT116 cells (a gift from Dr. Bert
Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins University) were maintained in McCoy’s
5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL
penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine in a humidified

incubator at 37jC with 5% CO2. HeLa cells (American Type Culture
Collection) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine in a
humidified incubator at 37jC with 5% CO2. Compounds were dissolved
into DMSO or directly into medium and added to cells for the indicated
times.
Reagents. All compounds were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise
noted. Cycloheximide (CHX), DTT, glutathione, Hoechst 33342, NG monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate (L-NMMA), N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleuCHO (LLnL), and salubrinal were from Calbiochem. S-nitrosoglutathione
and nitrotyrosine bovine serum albumin were from Cayman Chemical. The
pCMV-HA-Cdc25A plasmid encoding Cdc25A was generated by cloning the
human CDC25A cDNA into the EcoR1 and XhoI sites of the pCMV-HA
vector (Clontech). The pcDNA3-Cdc25A vector encoding untagged Cdc25A
(18) and the pcDNA3-HA-ASK-1 vector (5) were described previously.
SNCEE was synthesized and quantified using its extinction coefficient in
methanol [1,019 (mol/L) 1 cm 1 at 343 nm], as previously described (19).
Light homolyzes the S-nitrosothiol (RSNO) S-N bond, releasing .NO and
thiyl radicals, which rapidly recombine in the absence of competing species
to generate disulfides (20). .NO rapidly autooxidizes in the presence of O2
and H2O to nitrite (16). Thus, the products of SNCEE decomposition are
L-cysteine ethyl ester disulfide and nitrite. SNCEE was decomposed by
incubation in clear conical vials at ambient temperature under laboratory lighting for z24 h to generate decomposed SNCEE. We verified

Figure 1. Low molecular mass RSNOs inhibited Cdc25A phosphatase activity in a redox-dependent manner. A, rHis-Cdc25A (500 ng) was pretreated for 30 min
with the indicated concentrations of SNCEE before assay of OMFP phosphatase activity at 25jC over 1 h. Results are expressed as percentage of vehicle-pretreated
Cdc25A activity. B, rHis-Cdc25A (500 ng) was pretreated for 30 min with 1 mmol/L DTT, 100 Amol/L Na3VO4, or the indicated concentrations of CEE and SNCEE
at which time it was incubated with 250 Ag cyclin B1 immunoprecipitate for 60 min at 37jC. Levels of phosphorylated Tyr15 Cdk1, total Cdk1, and Cdc25A were
then determined by Western blotting. C, rHis-Cdc25A was treated with 100 Amol/L decomposed SNCEE or SNCEE and then with h-mercaptoethanol or not before
SDS-PAGE. Migration of Cdc25A was then assessed by Western blotting with Cdc25A antibodies. D, rHis-Cdc25A was treated with 100 Amol/L SNCEE or not as
in Fig. 1B, at which time 20 mmol/L DTT was added where indicated immediately before assaying OMFP phosphatase activity. *, P < 0.001.

decomposition of SNCEE spectroscopically by the loss of absorbance of the
S-N bond at 343 nm before use. All manipulations of cells, lysates and
solutions containing RSNOs were performed under subdued lighting.
Adenoviral infection. HCT116 cells in 6-cm dishes were infected with 10
multiplicity of infection (MOI) Ad-LacZ or Ad-iNOS (a gift from Dr. Paul
Robbins, University of Pittsburgh) in 1.2 mL PBS in a humidified 37jC
incubator for 1 h, after which medium with or without 1 mmol/L L-NMMA
was added to the cells for 24 h before harvesting.
Transfection experiments. HCT116 cells were transfected with
plasmids encoding HA-tagged Cdc25A, untagged Cdc25A, and HA-tagged
ASK-1 using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) in serum-containing
medium according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Medium containing
DNA-lipid complexes was aspirated 3 h after transfection and replaced with
complete growth medium. We visually estimated the transfection efficiency
at 40% to 50% in cells transfected as above with green fluorescent protein
via green fluorescence.
Estimation of nitric oxide production. The nitrate/nitrite colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to quantify nitrite and nitrate in culture medium
as a measurement of .NO production in iNOS-expressing cells 24 h after
infection.
Fluorescence microscopy and cytotoxicity assays. Cells were washed
once with PBS before addition of 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at
ambient temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and nuclei were
stained with 1 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 in PBS. Apoptotic nuclei were counted
in three fields of view containing >100 cells each at 20 magnification for
each sample. Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Blue assay
from Promega according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoblotting and coimmunoprecipitation. Cells were harvested in
a modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (21) and either sonicated as
above or incubated on ice for 30 min with frequent vortexing. Lysates were
cleared by centrifugation at 13,000  g for 15 min. Protein content was
determined by the method of Bradford. Total cell lysates (30–50 Ag protein)
were resolved by SDS-PAGE using Tris-glycine gels [8% for Cdc25A, Cdc25B,
Cdc25C, iNOS, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), HA-ASK-1, and
h-tubulin Western blotting and 12% for Cdk1, phosphorylated Tyr15 Cdk1,
caspase-3, eIF2a, and phosphorylated Ser51 eIF2a Western blotting] and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 4jC overnight at 35 V for
Western blotting. Antibodies against Cdc25A, Cdc25C, Cdk1, and anti–cyclin
B1-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies
against Cdc25B and iNOS/NOS type II were from BD Transduction
Laboratories. Antibodies recognizing phosphorylated Tyr15 Cdk1, phosphorylated Ser51 eIF2a, eIF2a, and PARP were from Cell Signaling Technology,

the h-tubulin antibody was from Cedarlane Laboratories, the caspase-3
antibody was from Assay Designs, and the HA antibody was from Covance.
Bound primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) and proteins
were visualized using Pierce enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting
substrate (Pierce Biotechnology). Films were scanned using an Amersham
Biosciences SI densitometer and analyzed using ImageQuant software
(Amersham Biosciences) for quantification. For coimmunoprecipitation,
cells were harvested in HEPES lysis buffer (5), and 1.5 mg of protein were
precleared with 2 Ag of normal mouse IgG followed by incubation with 50 AL
of HA.11-affinity matrix (Covance) overnight at 4jC. After washing with
HEPES lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted into Laemmli buffer and
subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above.
Production of rHis-Cdc25A and Tyr15-hyperphosphorylated Cdk1/
cyclin B1 and Cdc25A phosphatase assays. rHis-Cdc25A was produced in
Escherichia coli and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (His6) resin, as
described previously (22), except that the protein was eluted in the absence
of reducing agents. To generate phosphorylated Tyr15 Cdk1, we treated
subconfluent HeLa cells for 1 h with 40 Amol/L etoposide, and 23 h later,
cells were lysed as above. Cyclin B1–associated Cdk1 was coimmunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated anti–cyclin B1 antibody. Precipitated
protein was frozen at 80jC until use. Dephosphorylation of Cdk1 was
measured by incubating 500 ng of rHis-Cdc25A with 250 Ag of cyclin B1
immunoprecipitate in a 50-AL final volume for 60 min at 37jC. Loading
buffer was then added, and samples were boiled to halt the reaction. Cdk1
phosphorylation at Tyr15 was determined by Western blotting as above using
a phosphorylated Tyr15 Cdk1 antibody. Cdc25A phosphatase activity was
measured at pH 7.4 and at ambient temperature with the artificial substrate
O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) at its K m in a 96-well microtiter
plate assay based on previously described methods (22). Fluorescence
emission (ex 485 nm, em 525 nm) was measured after a 60-min incubation
period with a Molecular Devices Corp. M5 Spectrophotometer.
UV treatment. Cells were washed once with PBS before UV irradiation
(UVC Crosslinker, Stratagene), followed by addition of fresh medium before
incubation for the indicated times and cell harvesting.
Radioisotope incorporation studies. Cells were washed twice with
PBS and incubated with priming medium (DMEM lacking L-cysteine or
L-methionine, supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 units/mL
penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine) for 1 h before addition
of 300 ACi/mL of EasyTag EXPRESS [35S] Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer).
Statistical analysis. Results were expressed as means F SE of at least
three independent experiments. ANOVA and t tests were performed using

S-nitrosothiols inhibited Cdc25A phosphatase activity. The
Cdc25A catalytic cysteine is predicted to have a low pKa and exist
primarily as a highly reactive thiolate anion (8, 23). The Cdc25A
catalytic domain crystal structure indicates that this catalytic
thiolate exists in a hydrophobic pocket and lies in an acid-base
motif (24, 25). As this catalytic thiolate is essential for its enzymatic
activity, S-nitrosation of the Cdc25A catalytic cysteine would be
expected to render the enzyme inactive. Because nitrosating agents
appear to preferentially S-nitrosate thiolates that exist in acidbase motifs and partition selectively in hydrophobic environments
(16, 17), we tested whether low molecular mass RSNOs regulated
Cdc25A phosphatase activity. We incubated recombinant Histagged Cdc25A with the low molecular mass RSNO SNCEE and
measured Cdc25A phosphatase activity with the artificial substrate
OMFP. As shown in Fig. 1A, SNCEE inhibited the activity of Cdc25A
with an IC50 value of 22.5 F 6.2 Amol/L. Inhibition of Cdc25A by

the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L L-NMMA. 24 h later, cells were harvested

SNCEE was mediated by the intact S-nitrosothiol as SNCEE was
stable over the course of the assay and decomposition of SNCEE
before treatment of Cdc25A compromised its activity (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also queried the effects of SNCEE on Cdc25A
activity toward its endogenous substrate, Cdk1/cyclin B complex.
As illustrated in Fig. 1B, dephosphorylation of Cdk1Tyr15 required
Cdc25A. Treatment of Cdc25A with SNCEE before incubation with
phosphorylated Tyr15 Cdk1/cyclin B prevented dephosphorylation
of Cdk1Tyr15. SNCEE did not inhibit Cdk2 activity in vitro,
suggesting some specificity for Cdc25A (data not shown). Together,
these results indicate that low molecular mass RSNOs regulate the
phosphatase activity of Cdc25A.
SNCEE induced redox-sensitive changes in Cdc25A. Upon
reaction with protein thiols RSNOs can generate S-nitrosothiols,
protein disulfides, and mixed disulfides (26). Each of these is
reversible with reductants. Thus, we examined whether SNCEE
caused reductant-sensitive changes in Cdc25A. We treated Cdc25A
with SNCEE or decomposed SNCEE and monitored its electrophoretic mobility under reducing and nonreducing conditions
(Fig. 1C). SNCEE-treated Cdc25A migrated more rapidly than
decomposed SNCEE-treated Cdc25A under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1C, lane 1 versus lane 2); addition of h-mercaptoethanol
to Cdc25A before SDS-PAGE ablated this enhanced migration
(Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). Vicinal dithiols, such as thioredoxin and
DTT, denitrosate protein RSNOs (27). To investigate the potential
biochemical significance of this change in mobility of Cdc25A, we
treated Cdc25A with SNCEE or decomposed SNCEE and added
DTT coincident with OMFP before measuring Cdc25A phosphatase
activity. Figure 1D shows that preaddition of DTT before the
phosphatase assay restored the majority of Cdc25A activity
attenuated by SNCEE. Full activity may not have been restored
due to the time dependence of DTT action. Together, these results
were consistent with a model in which a redox-sensitive
modification to the Cdc25A protein structure induced by low
molecular mass RSNOs inhibited Cdc25A phosphatase activity.
Cdc25A protein levels were decreased after SNCEE treatment in multiple tumor cell lines. We next investigated the
effects of nitrosative insult on cellular Cdc25A using SNCEE. We
treated HCT116 cells with 100 Amol/L SNCEE or the control
compounds L-cysteine ethyl ester (CEE) or decomposed SNCEE, as
100 Amol/L SNCEE induced significant accumulation of intracellular RSNOs, but did not produce accumulation of the oxidative
and nitrative stress marker 3-nitrotyrosine, which decreased
moderately in some but not all experiments (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Surprisingly, SNCEE, but neither decomposed SNCEE nor
CEE, decreased Cdc25A protein levels; the protein levels of h-tubulin
were unaffected (Fig. 2A). We observed no significant change in the
protein levels of Cdk2 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating some specificity for
Cdc25A. Cdc25A loss was time-dependent, with the lowest Cdc25A
levels occurring f2 h after treatment and rebounding by 4 h
posttreatment (Fig. 2B). Cdc25A suppression after SNCEE was
concentration-dependent; treatment of HCT116 cells with 50 Amol/L
SNCEE resulted in loss of >60% of Cdc25A by 2 h after treatment (Fig. 2C). A similar concentration-dependent loss of Cdc25A
protein levels in response to SNCEE was observed in HeLa cervical
carcinoma cells (Fig. 2D) indicating that SNCEE decreased Cdc25A
levels in cells derived from multiple tumor types. Recognition of
Cdc25A by the antibody used for Western blotting was unaffected
by RSNOs directly under the reducing conditions of SDS-PAGE
(Fig. 1C), suggesting a bona fide decrease in Cdc25A protein levels.

Multimodal Control of Cdc25A by Nitrosative Stress

Figure 4. Cdc25A protein stability was not decreased after SNCEE treatment. A, HCT116 cells were cotreated with 25 Ag/mL CHX and either 100 Amol/L decomposed
SNCEE, 100 Amol/L SNCEE, or 60 J/m2 UV. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points for Western blotting. Western blots were then densitometrically
scanned, and remaining Cdc25A levels were expressed as fraction Cdc25A at time = 0 after normalization to h-tubulin. B, representative Western blots used to
generate A. C, HCT116 cells were treated simultaneously with DMSO or 20 Amol/L LLnL and with 100 Amol/L of the indicated compounds or 60 J/m2 UV irradiation
as described in Materials and Methods. Cells were harvested 2 h later for Western blotting.

iNOS-derived .NO decreased Cdc25A expression. In cells
iNOS catalyzes RSNO production and initiates nitrosative stress
(15). To investigate whether intracellular production of .NO from
an endogenous source affected Cdc25A expression, we infected
HCT116 cells with adenovirus encoding the human iNOS cDNA.
Expression of iNOS induced .NO formation (Fig. 3A) similar to the
concentrations of SNCEE used above and did not induce nitration
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Production of .NO from iNOS decreased
Cdc25A protein levels but did not affect Cdc25B or Cdc25C
(Fig. 3B). Loss of Cdc25A was independent of multiple known
regulators of Cdc25A stability or transcription (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Blockade of .NO production by the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA
prevented .NO generation and restored Cdc25A levels (Fig. 3A
and B). These results show that endogenously generated .NO
decreased Cdc25A protein levels.
Cdc25A half-life was not shortened after SNCEE treatment.
Cdc25A is a labile protein with a short half-life (1). In response to
various stresses, Cdc25A becomes hyperphosphorylated by several
stress-dependent kinases, including p38, Chk1, and Chk2, subsequently targeting Cdc25A for degradation via ubiquitin-mediated
proteolysis (1). To determine whether nitrosative stress suppressed
Cdc25A by decreasing its protein half-life, we treated HCT116
cells with UV irradiation, which decreases Cdc25A half-life (28), or
either decomposed SNCEE or SNCEE, and monitored its half-life
after blockade of new protein synthesis with CHX (Fig. 4A and B).
Logarithmic regression analysis of the data indicated half-lives of
25.1 and 15.5 min for Cdc25A in decomposed SNCEE-treated and
UV-treated cells, respectively, consistent with UV-induced accelerated Cdc25A turnover. Cdc25A did not decrease logarithmically
after SNCEE treatment; rather, Cdc25A levels seemed to be
temporarily stabilized, although by 120 min most of the Cdc25A

www.aacrjournals.org

was lost (Fig. 4A and B). We hypothesize this may be due to
inhibition of one or more Cdc25A E1 or E2 ubiquitin ligases, which
also contain catalytic cysteines. These results suggested that
Cdc25A stability was not decreased in response to SNCEE
treatment. Similarly, pretreatment of HCT116 cells with the
proteasomal inhibitor LLnL blocked UV-induced Cdc25A loss, but
not Cdc25A loss due to treatment with SNCEE or the protein
synthesis inhibitor CHX (Fig. 4C), distinguishing these from
modulators of Cdc25A protein turnover. Collectively, these results
argued against a proteasomal mechanism of Cdc25A loss in
response to SNCEE.
SNCEE repressed protein translation and down-regulated
Cdc25A posttranscriptionally. Transcription from the Cdc25A
promoter is negatively regulated by several known stressresponsive proteins, including p53, p21, and HIF-1a (29–31).
.NO or nitrosative stress have been reported to activate and/or
stabilize the expression of several of these proteins (32–34); thus,
we investigated whether the Cdc25A promoter region was
essential for SNCEE-mediated Cdc25A suppression. We transfected
HCT116 cells with vectors containing the CDC25A cDNA under
the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and monitored the
effect of SNCEE on Cdc25A levels. Decreased HA-Cdc25A levels
were observed with SNCEE but not decomposed SNCEE or CEE
(Fig. 5A). This implied that down-regulation of Cdc25A after
SNCEE was a promoter-independent, posttranscriptional effect.
Attenuation of protein translation provides a functional mechanism to decrease the protein levels of a rapidly synthesized protein.
The short half-life of Cdc25A indicated a rapid synthetic rate
for Cdc25A, so we investigated whether SNCEE affected overall
protein synthesis. We treated HCT116 cells with radiolabeled
[35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine for different time periods after

decomposed SNCEE or SNCEE treatment and monitored total
radioisotope incorporation into proteins via SDS-PAGE and
autoradiography (Fig. 5B). Total protein loading was equal as
assessed by h-tubulin levels; radiolabeled amino acid incorporation
into protein from SNCEE-treated cell lysates, however, was reduced
during both the first and second hours, consistent with the time
course of Cdc25A decrease. In addition, the magnitude of protein
synthesis repression was consistent with the expression levels of
Cdc25A in SNCEE-treated cells. Together, these results suggested
that SNCEE treatment decreased Cdc25A protein translation.
eIF2A regulated basal Cdc25A levels and response to
SNCEE. SNCEE decreased global protein synthesis. Stress-dependent
global translational inhibition is mediated primarily through
phosphorylation and inhibition of the translational regulator eIF2a
(35). In response to various stresses, eIF2a is phosphorylated on
Ser51 by stress-sensitive kinases (36). Phosphorylation of eIF2a at
Ser51 increases its affinity for the eIF2B subunit, whose release
from the eIF2 complex is necessary for GDP-GTP recycling and
subsequent tRNA recruitment and binding (35). Thus, eIF2aSer51
hyperphosphorylation results in a general decrease in protein
translation. To investigate whether SNCEE altered the activity of
eIF2a, we treated cells with 100 Amol/L SNCEE and monitored
phosphorylation of eIF2aSer51 using phosphorylated-specific antibodies (Fig. 5C). Although the total levels of eIF2a were not
changed in response to SNCEE, the pool of phosphorylated
eIF2aSer51 increased in a time-dependent manner with phosphorylated eIF2aSer51 appearing as soon as 30 minutes after SNCEE
treatment and persisting for at least 2 hours after treatment. The
kinetics of eIF2a hyperphosphorylation were consistent with the
loss of Cdc25A protein, as well as with attenuation of protein
synthesis in response to SNCEE.
To determine whether inhibition of eIF2a was sufficient to
suppress Cdc25A protein levels, we treated HCT116 cells with the

eIF2a inhibitor salubrinal (37) or vehicle and determined the
effects on Cdc25A expression by Western blotting (Fig. 5D). In
response to eIF2a inhibition, Cdc25A levels decreased to levels
similar to those observed in SNCEE-treated cells. This implied that
eIF2a was a regulator of basal Cdc25A protein levels and suggested
that eIF2a inhibition in response to SNCEE was the mechanism by
which nitrosative stress decreased Cdc25A.
Nitrosative stress decreased the fraction of Cdc25A-bound
ASK-1 and sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapeuticinduced apoptosis. Cdc25A protects against apoptosis by binding
to and inhibiting ASK-1 (5). We hypothesized that Cdc25A protein
modification (Fig. 1C) or suppression (Fig. 2A) by nitrosative stress
would sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli by decreasing its
association with ASK-1. We expressed Cdc25A and HA-tagged
ASK-1 (HA-ASK-1) in HCT116 cells and measured the effect of
SNCEE-induced nitrosative stress on Cdc25A-ASK-1 interaction by
coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 6A). SNCEE decreased the amount of
Cdc25A associated with ASK-1 at 2 hours, consistent with Cdc25A
loss after SNCEE (Fig. 2B).
CDDP induces apoptosis through the ASK-1 pathway (38). We
exposed cells to 10 Amol/L CDDP or vehicle after pretreatment
with 100 Amol/L of either decomposed SNCEE or fresh SNCEE and
measured apoptosis after 24 and 48 hours (Fig. 6B and C). SNCEE
alone did not affect basal nuclear fragmentation frequency
compared with decomposed SNCEE (2.08 F 0.51% versus 1.58 F
0.31%; Fig. 6B), and pretreatment of cells with SNCEE increased
apoptosis 2-fold (13.83 F 1.37%) after CDDP compared with
decomposed SNCEE-pretreated cells (7.00 F 0.87%). Similarly,
SNCEE pretreatment before 10 Amol/L CDDP induced cleavage of
PARP and procaspase-3 as evidenced by accumulation of cleaved
PARP and p17/p20 caspase-3 subunits (Fig. 6C) whereas decomposed SNCEE and CDDP cotreatment did not. In agreement with
sensitization to CDDP-induced apoptosis by SNCEE, cell viability

was decreased by >20% in SNCEE and CDDP cotreated cells,
whereas neither SNCEE alone nor decomposed SNCEE and CDDP
cotreatment significantly affected cell viability (Fig. 6D). Together,
these results indicate that nitrosative stress decreased Cdc25A
association with ASK-1 and sensitized cells to apoptotic cell death,
consistent with an inhibitory role for Cdc25A in ASK-1–mediated
apoptosis.

Discussion
Stringent Cdc25A regulation is critical for cell growth without
unwarranted proliferation. High Cdc25A expression and activity are
hallmarks of human cancers, likely conveying resistance to
apoptosis and to antigrowth signals. Thus, mechanisms have
evolved to rapidly suppress Cdc25A after normal and stressmediated cellular signaling. Previous research uncovered transcriptional and proteasomal control of Cdc25A after stress; herein,
we report two distinct mechanisms regulating Cdc25A after
exposure to .NO and RNS: translational suppression after nitrosative stress and enzymatic inhibition of Cdc25A by low molecular

www.aacrjournals.org

mass RSNOs. These mechanisms may be most prevalent in tumor
tissues expressing iNOS or in tumors derived from chronic
inflammatory diseases, as .NO generated from iNOS was sufficient
to suppress Cdc25A levels (Fig. 3B).
SNCEE reversibly inhibited Cdc25A activity. RSNOs can induce
S-nitrosation of target cysteines and generate mixed disulfides
from thiols (26, 39). These modifications to Cdc25A could induce a
migration shift by SDS-PAGE, would be reversible with DTT, and
would be expected to inhibit its phosphatase activity if the catalytic
cysteine were modified. Alternatively, generation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between the active site thiolate and a proximal
thiol, as reported for H2O2-treated Cdc25, could occur (8). Our
preliminary experiments indicate that 100 Amol/L SNCEE induced
S-nitrosation of 2 mol cysteine/mol Cdc25A (data not shown), and
we are currently using mass spectrometry to identify the specific
sites of S-nitrosation in Cdc25A.
Translational Cdc25A suppression after nitrosative stress can be
distinguished from previous reports examining Cdc25A regulation
by RNS (11). In response to nitrating agents, Cdc25A loss was
paralleled by activation of the upstream kinase ATM and was

sensitive to okadaic acid. Protein phosphatase PP5 activity is
required for ATM activity (40), and PP5 is inhibited by okadaic acid
(41). These data imply the traditional DNA damage pathway
mediates Cdc25A loss after .NO2 or SIN-1 treatment. In contrast,
SNCEE did not decrease Cdc25A half-life nor was Cdc25A loss
blocked by proteasome inhibition. Also, pretreatment with the
ATM/ATR inhibitor caffeine did not block Cdc25A loss after SNCEE
treatment, although UV-induced Cdc25A loss was inhibited
(Supplementary Fig. S6). This further distinguished SNCEEmediated Cdc25A down-regulation from the traditional DNA
damage pathway. Collectively, this work and previous studies (11)
reinforce the concept that distinct RNS mediate discrete intracellular signaling.
eIF2aSer51 is phosphorylated by the stress-responsive eIF2
kinases PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), hemeregulated inhibitor (HRI), GCN2, and RNA-dependent protein
kinase (36) and dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1;
refs. 37, 42). How eIF2a becomes hyperphosphorylated in response
to RNS is unknown, although several candidate mediators exist.
PP1 is inhibited by H2O2 in PC12 cells and suppression of PP1
activity in H2O2-treated cells correlated with phosphorylation of
eIF2aSer51 (43). H2O2 can deplete thiols by oxidation to intermolecular and intramolecular disulfides or higher-order cysteine
oxides. SNCEE depleted thiols (Supplementary Fig. S2B), indicating
that this could be responsible for eIF2aSer51 hyperphosphorylation
in response to RSNOs.
Perturbations to the ER redox status either in response to
reductants (44) or RNS are reported to initiate ER stress and, thus,
generate phosphorylated eIF2aSer51, presumably through activation
of PERK (45). Whereas .NO-derived species have not been reported
to directly activate PERK, S-nitrosation of the ER-localized protein
disulfide isomerase results in protein misfolding, which is a wellcharacterized ER stress (46). This could initiate eIF2a hyperphosphorylation and subsequent translational inhibition. Although
PERK-mediated translational inhibition can occur rapidly in
response to several stimuli (44), it remains undetermined whether
PERK is activated in response to RNS, or whether S-nitrosation of
protein disulfide isomerase and subsequent ER stress is mediated
rapidly enough to elicit .NO-induced and SNCEE-induced loss
of Cdc25A.
In addition to PERK activation, HRI kinase activity has
previously been reported to be activated in response to .NO. HRI
may not be the major target of SNCEE-induced eIF2a hyperphosphorylation in HCT116 cells, as HRI protein is expressed

Cdc25A inhibits apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting the
proapoptotic mitogen-activated protein kinase family member
ASK-1 (5). Overexpression of Cdc25A attenuates ASK-1 activation
and apoptosis in response to H2O2, suggesting that dissociation of
Cdc25A from ASK-1 is a required step for stimulation of ASK-1
kinase activity (5). Nitrosative stress decreased the Cdc25A-bound
fraction of ASK-1 (Fig. 6A). Apoptotic death induced by CDDP is
ASK-1–dependent (38) and was increased in cells pretreated with
SNCEE. The decoupling of Cdc25A from ASK-1 may be a prerequisite for ASK-1–dependent apoptosis; thus translational
suppression of Cdc25A after nitrosative stress may represent
cellular priming of the apoptotic machinery. We have observed
activation of the ASK-1 downstream target kinase p38 after SNCEE
treatment with kinetics similar to loss of Cdc25A,1 consistent
with a model where suppression of Cdc25A after stress generated
by high .NO primes the cell for ASK-1 activation and apoptotic
signaling through the p38 pathway. Future studies in our laboratory
are centered on testing this hypothesis.
In summary, we have described novel regulation of Cdc25A in
response to .NO and .NO-derived species: RSNOs reversibly inhibit
Cdc25A phosphatase activity, whereas inhibition of eIF2a after
nitrosative stress suppresses translation of Cdc25A protein. SNCEE
attenuated inhibitory binding of Cdc25A to ASK-1 and sensitized
cells to apoptosis. Together, these results highlight the importance
of stringent control of Cdc25A to regulate cellular activities.
We speculate that this multifaceted control of Cdc25A allows a
cellular ‘‘stopwatch’’ function, where rapid inhibition of Cdc25A
phosphatase activity upon RSNO accumulation blunts phosphatase
activity-dependent Cdc25A signaling, whereas prolonged or severe
.NO-mediated cell stress suppresses Cdc25A levels and attenuates
nonenzymatic Cdc25A functions, such as apoptosis suppression.
