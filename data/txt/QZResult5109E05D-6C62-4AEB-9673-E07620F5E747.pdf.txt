BACKGROUND: Tumor vascularity is a potential predictor of treatment outcomes in metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(mRCC), and contrast enhancement of tumors in computed tomography (CT) is correlated significantly with microvessel density. In this study, the authors investigated whether tumor enhancement in contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is
useful for predicting outcomes in patients with mRCC who are receiving antiangiogenic therapy. METHODS: Attenuation values were reviewed retrospectively on CECT images of all metastatic lesions in 66 patients from February
2007 to November 2008. All patients received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (either sunitinib or sorafenib). Tumor
response was evaluated on CECT studies every 12 weeks. The authors analyzed the association between contrast
enhancement and treatment outcomes, including objective response, tumor size reduction rate, time to response,
and time to progression. RESULTS: In 46 patients, 198 metastatic lesions were assessed. Tumor size was reduced in
140 lesions (70.7%) and was increased in 58 lesions (29.3%). The mean reduction in size was 23.8%. The overall mean
time to response and the time to progression were 8.6 months and 16.4 months, respectively. In multivariate analyses,
tumor enhancement and enhancement pattern were associated with objective responses (P ¼ .003 and P ¼ .028,
respectively). In addition, tumor enhancement was associated with tumor size reduction (P ¼ .004). In Cox proportional hazards models, only tumor enhancement was associated significantly with the time to size reduction and progression-free survival (P ¼ .03 and P ¼ .015, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor enhancement on CECT images was
associated with treatment outcomes and was identified as a potential predictor of treatment outcomes after antianC 2010 American Cancer Society.

The incidence and mortality rates of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been rising steadily worldwide at a rate of 2% to

3% per decade.1,2 The annual incidence of metastatic RCC (mRCC) in major European countries, the United States, and
Japan ranges from 1500 to 8600 cases.2 However, treatment options are few because of the high resistance of these tumors
to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although cytokine-based therapies have produced response rates of 10%
to 20% in patients with mRCC, their overall clinical value is limited.3
Targeted therapy recently has evolved as a treatment for malignancy and has changed the treatment paradigms for
advanced or metastatic disease in several malignancies, including mRCC. This innovation is based on a better understanding of cell signal transduction and the molecular pathways of growth factors and receptors associated with tumor

angiogenesis. Targeted agents inhibit angiogenesis, reducing tumor growth and progression through the inhibition
of tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors.
Treatment of mRCC with sunitinib and sorafenib has
improved response and prolonged progression-free survival significantly.4-7
Several clinical factors are associated with outcome
in patients with mRCC, including performance status,
disease-free interval, number of metastatic sites, and laboratory variables like hemoglobin, calcium, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.8-10 Although recent studies suggest
that these factors remain pertinent,11-13 because cytokinebased therapy and targeted therapy have different mechanisms of action, optimal clinical factors associated with
outcomes of targeted therapy in mRCC should be reinvestigated. Theoretically, tumor vascularity may be a predictive factor for outcomes of targeted therapy.
Preliminary results with serum measures, including
plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
circulating endothelial cells, have produced only modest
success and are in relatively early stages of refinement.14,15
Microvessel density may be an optimal predictive factor
for outcomes of antiangiogenic therapy, but the difficulty
of applying it to all lesions means that it has limited widespread use in clinical practice.16 Other methods for the
assessment of tumor vascularity, such as molecular imaging or measures of blood volume or flow change using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been proposed
but remain in the experimental stage.15,17-19
The imaging method that is used most commonly
to evaluate metastatic lesions during treatment is contrastenhanced computed tomography (CECT). Several studies
have demonstrated that tumor enhancement on CECT is
correlated significantly with microvessel density, a pathologic marker that represents tumor vascularity in
RCC.16,20 Therefore, contrast enhancement of metastatic
lesions may be a predictive factor for outcome after targeted therapy in patients with mRCC. However, to our
knowledge, the association between tumor enhancement
on CECT and outcomes of targeted therapy has not been
investigated. In the current study, we examined whether
tumor enhancement on CECT could predict treatment
outcomes after targeted therapies in patients with mRCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This retrospective study was approved by the institutional
review board of the Center (NCCNCS-09-217). By using

Cancer

May 15, 2010

a kidney cancer database that was collected prospectively
by the Center, we identified patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for mRCC from February 2007 to November 2008. The inclusion of patients
in this study was subject to the following criteria: histologic confirmation of a clear cell type tumor component
using tissue biopsies or resection of primary renal lesions,
the presence of measurable metastatic tumors that measured >10 mm in greatest dimension, the use of TKIs for
initial targeted therapy, at least 2 cycles of TKI therapy,
the existence of follow-up CECT images after the initial 2
cycles of TKI therapy, and the use of chest or abdominal
CECT scans as the follow-up imaging method. We identified 66 patients who received TKI therapy. Of these, 20
were excluded for the following reasons: follow-up of <2
cycles in 8 patients, discontinuation of TKIs because of
toxicity before 2 cycles in 6 patients, loss of follow-up
before the first response evaluation in 4 patients, and the
use of nonenhanced CT or MRI instead of CECT because
of impaired renal function in 2 patients. Forty-six patients
met the criteria for inclusion in this study.
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy
We followed the protocols of phase 3 trials of sunitinib
and sorafenib for administration schedules.4,5 The
patients received 1 of 2 treatment regimens: 1) sunitinib
maleate (Sutent; Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Inc., Seoul,
Korea) administered orally at a dose of 50 mg once daily,
taken without regard to meals, in 6-week cycles consisting
of 4 weeks of treatment followed by 2 weeks without treatment; or 2) sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Seoul, Korea) administered orally at a
dose of 400 mg twice daily in continuous 6-week cycles.4,5
TKIs were discontinued temporarily when grade 3 or 4
toxicity occurred according to National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0, and continuation
depended on whether the patient recovered from toxicity.
Response was evaluated according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.21
Computed Tomography Imaging Protocol
Patients underwent baseline CECT scans before the initiation of antiangiogenic treatment and received CECT
scans for response evaluation of metastatic lesions every
12 weeks after treatment began, regardless of the TKI
administered. CT imaging was performed using 4-channel and 16-channel MDCT scanners (Mx 8000: Marconi
Medical Systems, Tel Aviv, Israel; and LightSpeed Pro 16:

2333

Original Article

GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis, respectively). Images
were obtained in a craniocaudal direction.22 A CT scan
was performed before contrast injection. Patients were
administered intravenous contrast material (Iopromide,
Ultravist 300; Schering, Berlin, Germany) through an
antecubital vein using a mechanical injector (120 mL at 3
mL per second). Scanning for early phase images began
35 seconds after the start of intravenous contrast injection
either from the lower thorax to the lower pelvis or from
the neck to the upper abdomen. The following scanning
parameters were used for the Light Speed Ultra CT scanner: peak tube voltage, 120 kVp; tube current, 120 to 400
mA; rotation time, 0.5 seconds; reconstruction thickness,
2.5 mm; and detector configuration, 16-detector rows
with a pitch of 0.938. The following parameters were
used for the MX 8000 scanner: peak tube voltage, 120
kVp; tube current, 140 mA; rotation time, 0.75 seconds;
reconstruction thickness, 3.2 mm; and detector configuration, 4-detector rows with a pitch of 1.75.
Evaluation of Tumor Enhancement
All images were examined using a picture archiving and
communication system, which displayed image data on
monitors, by 2 radiologists (D.C.J. and H.J.C.) with 6
years and 8 years of experience in uroradiology, respectively. To obtain attenuation values, quantitative evaluation of regional enhancement was performed by manual
measurements using a round or ovoid, manually controllable region of interest (ROI) placed in the center of metastatic nodules by consensus between the 2 radiologists.
Circular ROIs >mm2 were drawn to encompass as much
of the nodule as possible, covering >50% of the nodule
but excluding peripheral areas to avoid partial volume
effects from adjacent normal parenchyma. In addition,
calcification, blood vessels, and necrotic and cystic areas
were excluded from ROI measurements as much as possible. The attenuation values of the ROIs were measured an
average of 3 times.
Data Collection
Baseline patient data, including age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, history of primary tumor removal, histologic type of the primary tumor, histologic type of
metastases, history of cytokine-based therapy, type of
TKI, number of metastases, and levels of serum hemoglobin, serum calcium, corrected calcium,9 and lactate dehydrogenase, were collected from patient interviews and
reviews of medical records. Tumor characteristics, including metastatic site, tumor size, growth pattern, existence

2334

of necrosis, enhancement pattern, and quantitative contrast enhancement measurements, were evaluated from
reviews of the serial CECT images. Brain lesions were
excluded in this study. Blastic bone lesions were excluded
in principle; however, lytic bone lesions or mixed lyticblastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components
that could be evaluated by CT were considered measurable lesions when the soft tissue component fulfilled the
definition of measurability.23 Tumor size was defined as
the greatest dimension of the tumor lesion. Round or
lobulated tumors with clear margins were classified as
conglomerated, and tumors with irregular shapes or margins were classified as infiltrative. The existence of necrosis
was defined as the presence of a nonenhanced portion
within the tumor lesion. Enhancement patterns were classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Homogenous enhancement was defined as an even distribution of
contrast uptake within an enhanced portion of a lesion,
and heterogeneous enhancement was defined as an
unequal distribution of contrast uptake within an
enhanced portion of a lesion. A consensus between the 2
radiologists was required to classify each enhancement
pattern. Tumor enhancement was defined as the difference in Hounsfield units (HUs) between nonenhanced
and enhanced phases on CECT scans.

Statistical Analyses
The first endpoint of the study, the objective response of
individual metastatic lesions, was evaluated using 2 different methods. Objective responses initially were classified
as either responsive or nonresponsive according to
RECIST guidelines. A chi-square test or Fisher exact test
was performed for binomial variables, and biserial correlation analysis was used for continuous variables. Logistic
regression was used in multivariate analyses. Objective
response was considered a continuous variable, with the
tumor size reduction rate calculated as follows: (final
reduced size  initial size)/initial size. Independent Student t tests and analyses of variance were used in univariate
analysis for binomial variables, and correlation coefficient
analyses were used for continuous variables. Multivariate
linear regression analysis was used in multivariate analysis.
A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used
to summarize the accuracy of tumor enhancement on
CECT and to evaluate the true-positive rate against the
false-positive rate for the different possible cutoff points
of the CECT attenuation value. The area under the curve
(AUC) was calculated. According to the different cutoff

Cancer

Tumor Enhancement and mRCC Outcomes/Han et al

points, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
and negative predictive value were calculated.
To evaluate the time to response of individual metastatic lesions, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and a
Cox regression model in univariate survival analysis and a
Cox hazard regression model in multivariate survival analysis. The time to size reduction was defined as the time
from the initiation of TKIs to a reduction >30% in the
initial tumor size. The second endpoint of the study was
the time to progression of individual metastatic lesions,
which was defined as the time from the initiation of TKIs
to an increase >20% in the initial tumor size. The
Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox regression model used
in univariate survival analysis, and a multivariate Cox hazard regression model was used in multivariate survival
analysis.
To control for individual confounding factors in the
analysis of metastatic tumors, tumor variables were
adjusted with respect to the patient variables using multivariate analysis. Patient variables were used only for statistical adjustment and, thus, were not interpreted as
predictors. All multivariate analyses used variables that
were significant (P < .05) in the univariate analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 17.0 for Windows (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Ill). All tests were 2-sided and performed at
the 5% significance level.

the 46 patients. The median follow-up was 15 months
(range, 3-40 months), and the median number of cycles
of TKI therapy was 4 (range, 2-13 cycles). Overall, 14
patients (30.4%) responded to TKI therapy. There
were no complete responses; however, a partial response
was observed in 14 patients (30.4%). Stable disease was
observed in 17 patients (40.0%), and progression was
observed in 15 patients (37.5%). In 22 patients (47.8%),
the responses were identical for all individual metastases;
however, in 24 patients (52.2%), the responses of individual metastatic lesions varied, with mixed responses
observed among patients who had lesions within the same
organ. In addition, responding and nonresponding lesions
within the same organ occurred in 10 patients (21.7%),
and lesions of increasing and decreasing size were observed
in 12 patients (26.1%).

treatment outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to demonstrate that tumor enhancement on CECT
independently predicts tumor response and prognosis after targeted therapy in individual mRCC lesions.
On the basis of multivariate analyses, contrast
enhancement of the tumor was correlated independently
with tumor size reduction and the time to response during
antiangiogenic therapy (Tables 3 and 4). In addition, contrast enhancement was associated with the time to progression in individual metastatic lesions (Table 5).

patient factors, contrast enhancement was a statistically
significant predictor of treatment outcomes in metastatic
lesions. Finally, we demonstrated that objective responses
and the prognoses of individual metastatic lesions could
be predicted by measuring pretreatment tumor enhancement in individual metastatic lesions (Table 6, Fig. 5).
These findings suggest that tumor enhancement, as measured by CECT, may be used to predict outcomes for metastatic lesions during targeted therapy in patients with
mRCC.
Several factors, such as vascularity, vascular density,
vascular permeability, and blood flow, affect contrast
uptake in tumors.15-20 These influences are not understood completely and should be investigated further,
although several studies have demonstrated that contrast
enhancement in MRI mirrors the biologic and histologic
properties of tumor angiogenesis.15,17,18,24-26 These studies suggest the possibility of contrast enhancement as a
potent predictor for the response or prognosis of metastases in mRCC; however, to our knowledge, no study to
date has demonstrated this possibility using CECT in
patients with mRCC. The measurement of contrast
enhancement on CECT does not provide a quantitative

permeability, and extracellular volume fraction. Dynamic
CECT or MRI may be more appropriate for evaluating
these variables with respect to angiogenic activity. However, in clinical practice, CECT is used as a fairly standard
protocol for measuring tumor vascularity. Furthermore,
although several studies have demonstrated that measures
using MRI are promising for the evaluation of tumor vascularity, the resolution of MRI is lower than that of CT

for lung and abdominal organs, indicating that MRI is of
limited use in evaluating metastases. However, CECT is
the most commonly used follow-up method for serial
changes in tumor lesions during treatment, and measures
of tumor enhancement on CECT are included in the routine evaluation of tumor lesions in clinical practice and
require no invasive tests or further processes.
Our findings may have significant clinical implications. Variable responses of multiple metastases frequently
are observed in patients undergoing systemic therapies.
Genetically, metastases are heterogeneous in several
malignancies, including RCC.27 Even primary RCCs that
grow with extensive angiogenesis can have metastases that
express distinct angiogenic and nonangiogenic growth
patterns.28 The heterogeneity of metastases also was apparent in our study population, and many patients had variable contrast enhancement of their metastatic tumors.
Because blood vessels are subject to the influence of the
local microenvironment and cytokines produced by tumor cells,14 clinical factors like serum VEGF levels are
promising for predicting outcomes of antiangiogenic
therapies for metastases from clear cell RCC. However,
levels cannot predict the heterogeneous responses of metastatic tumors. Our results demonstrate that measures of
contrast enhancement allow pretreatment prediction of
outcomes for individual metastatic lesions during targeted
therapy and may be useful for improving the selection of
lesions that will benefit from targeted therapy in the treatment of mRCC.
The variability of contrast enhancement demonstrated in the current study means that, given the heterogeneity in the angiogenic dependency of individual
metastatic tumors, which may be responsible for the failure of some antiangiogenic trials, and the nonangiogenic
growth patterns of some metastases, such tumors probably
would not respond to antiangiogenic agents.28 In our
study, 10 patients (21.7%) had both responding and

nonresponding lesions. In 12 patients (26.1%), lesions of
increasing size were present simultaneously with other
lesions of decreasing size. The majority of clear cell RCCs
have biallelic von Hippel-Lindau gene inactivation, which
results in the overexpression of growth factors, including
VEGF, allowing the hypervascular characteristics of RCC
and a favorable response to antiantiogenic therapy29;
whereas metastatic lesions may have tumor characteristics
that differ from those of a primary renal tumor even
within the same patient, because genetically diverse cancer
cells can be seeded by the primary tumor, and genetic
changes also can occur in the process of disease progression and metastases. Genetic heterogeneity of metastatic
clones and diverse microenvironments supporting metastatic growths seem to allow different response patterns to
antiangiogenic therapy. However, the exact mechanism
should be investigated further.
Current strategies for cancer treatment tend to focus
excessively on a patient’s overall outcome. The RECIST,
currently the most commonly used criteria for response,
overcome this weakness by using the sum of the greatest
tumor dimensions, but these criteria are insufficient for
the individual evaluation of heterogeneous responses
within a patient. In our study, some patients stopped
using TKIs because a small number of metastases progressed, although most metastases responded well or were

stable during TKI therapy. Metastasectomy after targeted
therapy or after combination therapy with other agents
might play a vital role in this patient population and is
worthy of investigation.30 These findings reflect the need
to treat individual metastases in mRCC with multidisciplinary approaches that are chosen according to the characteristics of individual metastatic lesions before
treatment is initiated. Our analysis using classification
according to tumor enhancement suggests that lesional
approaches, through the measurement of pretreatment
contrast enhancement values, may be useful in outcome
prediction and treatment selection.
Our study has limitations. Because of the retrospective nature of the study and our small cohort, we cannot
rule out a possible bias in patient selection. In a significant
number of patients, there was a high correlation between
responses in different lesions within a patient rather than a
heterogeneous response. We addressed this possible
patient-based difference in tumor response by adjusting the
tumor (lesion) variables based on patient variables by using
multivariate analyses. Nevertheless, patient-based rather
than lesion-based differences cannot be ruled out, and this
is a limitation in this study design. A statistical model
explaining the correlation among lesions remains to be
established. In addition, survival analyses could not be performed, because the follow-up period was not long enough.
Therefore, the significance of tumor enhancement in predicting overall survival and the cutoff point that can differentiate metastatic lesions with a good prognosis from those
with a poor prognosis in patients with mRCC should be
investigated further. Future prospective studies with longterm follow-up will be required to confirm our findings.
In summary, tumor enhancement on CECT was
associated with tumor size reduction, time to response,
and time to progression of individual metastases in
patients with mRCC who received targeted therapy. Initial tumor enhancement on CECT may be useful as a clinical predictor during targeted therapy and to improve the
selection of patients who may benefit from targeted therapy in the treatment of mRCC.
