BACKGROUND. The current study was conducted to determine the clinical characteristics and prognostic features associated with prostatic small cell carcinoma
(SCC).

METHODS. Between January 1985 and May 2005, 83 patients with SCC of the
prostate were identified. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
modeling were used to assess the prognostic significance of the clinical parameters associated with disease-specific outcomes.

RESULTS. Twenty-one patients had no evidence of distant metastasis at the time
of the diagnosis of SCC, with the remaining patients demonstrating radiologic or
biopsy-proven evidence of metastatic disease. Compared with patients with me-

of diagnosis (P 5 .002). On multivariate analysis, an elevated serum LDH level
of inferior progression-free survival (P 5 .02 and P 5 .008, respectively) and inferior disease-specific survival (DSS) (P 5 .02 and P 5 .01, respectively). At the time
of last follow-up, 72 patients (87%) had died of disease, with a median DSS duration of 13.1 months (range, 10.7–17.1 months). There was a statistically significant difference noted with regard to the median DSS of patients with
nonmetastatic versus those with metastatic SCC (17.7 months [95% confidence
interval (95% CI), 12.1–39.2 months] vs 12.5 months [95% CI, 8.1–16.1 months],
respectively; P 5 .03).

CONCLUSIONS. SCC of the prostate is a highly aggressive tumor, with serum LDH
and albumin levels at the time of diagnosis believed to be predictive of diseaserelated outcomes. Although palliative, current systemic therapy does not result in
cure and does not provide long-term survival for patients with metastases. For
patients with nonmetastatic disease, a strategy utilizing systemic and local therapies should be evaluated further. Cancer 2007;110:1729–37.  2007 American

mall cell carcinoma (SCC) of the urinary tract is a rare clinical
entity, with scant information in the literature regarding its clinical behavior and optimal treatment. To our knowledge, the first
documented case of SCC of the prostate was described by Wenk
et al.1 in 1977. Since then, at least 130 other cases have been
reported. However, the majority of these cases have been reported
in case series, thereby limiting our ability to make definitive conclusions regarding the natural history and most effective treatment of
this disease.

The clinical features of prostatic SCC differ from
those of adenocarcinoma of the prostate in that SCC
has a predilection to produce visceral metastases,
lytic bony lesions, and low amounts of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).2 Although the etiology of
prostatic SCC remains controversial, 3 theories have
been proposed to date. The first theory postulates
that SCC of the prostate originates from neuroendocrine cells.3 The second theory proposes that SCC of
the prostate results from dedifferentiation of prostatic adenocarcinoma; the presence of PSA staining
in some neuroendocrine cells appears to support this
hypothesis.4,5 The third theory suggests that stem
cells are the direct precursors of SCC of the prostate.6
Currently, it is unclear which of these theories
correctly explains the pathogenesis of SCC of the
prostate.
Oesterling et al.7 reported what to our knowledge
is 1 of the largest series of SCC of the prostate presented to date, with 27 patients treated over a 30year period. Of the 24 patients with long-term
follow-up, 92% died while receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The median overall survival
duration from the time of diagnosis of SCC was 17.1
months (range, 2–90 months). In a previous report
from our institution,8 11 of 20 patients with SCC of
the prostate had died of the disease. In a phase 2,
prospective study conducted at our center in which
38 patients with metastatic SCC of the prostate were
treated with 4 cycles of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and
etoposide, the overall response rate was 61% and the
median overall survival duration was 10.5 months.9
Combined, these studies demonstrate the aggressive
behavior of SCC of the prostate; however, there is
insufficient information concerning the prognostic
features underlying its progression and survival.
In the current study, we report our experience in
the management of SCC of the prostate over the past
20 years, focusing on the predictors of outcome in
this patient population. In addition, we present the
treatment-related outcomes of patients with nonmetastatic disease at the time of SCC diagnosis, and we
appraise the potential merits of local therapy in this
subgroup of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
Before conducting the current study, a retrospective
chart review protocol was designed and approved by
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board. Between January 1985
and May 2005, 103 patients were diagnosed with
SCC of the prostate at the M. D. Anderson Cancer

Center; 20 cases were excluded from the current
study because they did not meet the histologic criteria used to define SCC of the prostate. The remaining
83 patients constituted our study population and
were entered into a retrospective clinical database.
The diagnosis of SCC was determined on the basis
of the presence of undifferentiated carcinoma histology that demonstrated small-sized to medium-sized
cells with a minimal amount of cytoplasm and
hyperchromatic, overlapping nuclei with no or few
nucleoli, as observed in SCC of other organs. Immunohistochemical stains (PSA; prostatic acid phosphatase; cytokeratin; and neuroendocrine markers such
as chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56) were
used to support the diagnoses of SCC of the prostate
when tissues were available. Cases in which the diagnosis of SCC of the prostate was suspected clinically
as constituting metastasis to the prostate from SCC
of nonprostatic origin were excluded.
Diagnostic evaluation of SCC of the prostate at
our center consisted of a complete medical history,
physical examination, laboratory investigations,
transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) of the prostate
with biopsies (if not previously performed), and radiologic imaging (chest X-ray, computed tomography
scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and bone scan).
Additional imaging modalities were obtained by the
treating physician on an individual basis. All patients
were staged using the 1997 TNM staging system. To
confirm the original diagnosis of SCC of the prostate,
all pathology reports were reviewed by a single genitourinary pathologist (F.V.L.) to confirm the diagnosis
of SCC of the prostate; however, 23 cases in which
the diagnosis was questioned based on interpretation
of the prior histopathology report by our pathologist
were rereviewed in detail to verify the diagnosis as
SCC of the prostate.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics such as the median (range) for
continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for
categoric variables were used to summarize the distribution of diagnostic, treatment-related, and disease-related variables. The pairwise association
between continuous variables was assessed using the
Spearman correlation coefficient. The 2 study endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). For the analysis of DSS,
disease-specific death was the only event noted, with
patients who survived being censored at the time of
last follow-up. For the analysis of PFS, disease progression or recurrence, as demonstrated by pathology
or radiologic imaging, were defined as events. DSS

Prostatic Small Cell Carcinoma Treatment/Spiess et al.

duration was calculated from the date of the diagnosis of SCC to the date of disease-specific death; the
duration of PFS was calculated from the date of diagnosis of SCC to the date of disease progression, as
documented by imaging studies or tissue biopsy. The
method of Kaplan and Meier was used to estimate
the PFS or DSS probabilities.10 Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used
to assess the impact of the various clinical parameters on PFS or DSS. To further characterize the outcome of patients on the basis of serum albumin and
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, patients were
defined as having a low or high serum level of albumin or LDH using their respective medians as the
cutoff values. The log-rank test was used to assess
the difference in PFS or DSS among 4 groups of
patients defined based on low or high albumin or
LDH values. All statistical analyses were performed
using S-PLUS software (Insightful Corporation; Seattle, Wash), with P values < .05 deemed statistically
significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The patients’ characteristics are summarized in Table
1. On prostate biopsy, 30 patients (36%) were shown
to have pure SCC of the prostate and 53 patients
(64%) had mixed SCC and adenocarcinoma. The biopsy Gleason score in those patients with mixed histology was most commonly poorly differentiated,
defined as a Gleason score 8 (46 patients [87%]).
Twenty-seven patients (33%) had de novo SCC, with
no prior history of prostate cancer; the remaining 56
patients (67%) had prostatic adenocarcinoma before
the development of SCC. Of those 56 patients, 52
(93%) had received prior ADT, with a median interval
of 30 months (range, 4 months-10 years) from the
initiation of ADT to the diagnosis of SCC.
At the time of SCC diagnosis, 21 (25%) of the 83
patients had no evidence of metastatic disease, and
62 patients (75%) had radiologic-proven or biopsyproven metastases. The most common sites of metastases were bone (37 patients), retroperitoneal
lymph nodes (17 patients), liver (16 patients), and
lungs (11 patients). Eight patients (10%) developed
brain metastases. The majority of patients had either
1 (44 patients) or 2 (12 patients) sites of metastasis.
Sixty-eight patients (82%) had local symptoms at the
time of SCC diagnosis (lower urinary tract symptoms
in 32 patients, bladder outlet obstruction in 18
patients, pelvic pain in 12 patients, ureteral obstruction in 4 patients, and macroscopic hematuria in 2
patients).

(6 patients), or combined with surgery and ADT (3
patients), for a total of 76 patients. Sixty-eight of
these 76 patients (89%) received regimens containing
etoposide and/or a platinum compound, whereas the
remaining 8 patients (11%) received other chemotherapeutic regimens. Only 4 of the 21 patients
(19%) who had no evidence of metastatic disease at
the time of diagnosis of prostatic SCC received local
therapy in addition to systemic therapy. Local therapy in those 4 patients was comprised of radical
cystoprostatectomy (3 patients) and external beam
radiotherapy (1 patient). The 3 patients who had
undergone a cystoprostatectomy also had received
neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy before surgery;
however, they all developed distant metastases. As of
the date of last follow-up, 2 of these 3 patients had
died of SCC; the mean DSS duration for the 3
patients who underwent cystoprostatectomy was 4.0
years (range, 1.8–6.1 years) from the date of surgery.
The patient who was treated with definitive external
beam radiotherapy had also received neoadjuvant
and adjuvant ADT and was alive with no evidence of
disease at the time of last follow-up, 1.3 years after
radiotherapy. Three of these 4 patients had local
symptoms (lower urinary tract symptoms in 2
patients and urinary obstruction/pelvic pain in 1
patient) at the time of the diagnosis of SCC, but their
symptoms resolved after local therapy. In contrast,
of the 47 patients with metastatic SCC at the time of
diagnosis, only 5 (11%) had a noticeable improvement in their symptoms with systemic therapy
alone (3 patients had lower urinary tract symptoms
and 2 patients had pelvic pain). One of these patients

later received pelvic radiotherapy for symptomatic
control.

Laboratory Data
The median serum PSA level at the time of the diagnosis of SCC was 1.1 ng/mL, and none of the
patients had an elevated serum PSA level (>4 ng/
mL). The majority of patients had a normal serum
creatinine level at the time of SCC diagnosis, with a
median serum creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. The median serum albumin, LDH, and carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) levels at the time of diagnosis were 4
g/dL, 664 IU/L, and 5.4 ng/mL, respectively. A weak
colinear association was noted between serum LDH
and alkaline phosphatase levels, with a Spearman
correlation coefficient between these 2 variables of
0.38 (P 5 .002).
Nonmetastatic Versus Metastatic SCC
A comparison of the clinical, laboratory, and pathologic variables of patients with or without metastatic
disease at the time of the diagnosis of prostatic SCC
is shown in Table 2. Patients with nonmetastatic disease at the time of SCC diagnosis were significantly
older (median age of 71 years vs 63.5 years; P 5 .001)
and had a significantly lower serum LDH level at diagnosis (520 IU/L vs 788 IU/L; P 5 .002). No significant differences were noted between patients with
nonmetastatic disease and those with metastatic disease with regard to their serum PSA (P 5 .19) and
CEA (P 5 .79) levels. The absence of metastatic disease at the time of SCC diagnosis was associated
with longer PFS and DSS (Figs. 1 and 2, respectively).

PFS Analysis
Overall, disease progression developed in 80 patients
(96%), with a median PFS duration of 6 months
(Fig. 3). On univariate analysis, several potential predictors of PFS were identified, including hemoglobin,
log (serum creatinine level), log (serum LDH level),
log (serum alkaline phosphatase level), serum
albumin level, and the presence of metastasis at time
of SCC diagnosis (Table 3). However, on multivariate
analysis, only serum albumin level and log (serum
LDH level) at the time of SCC diagnosis were found
to be significant predictors of PFS (P 5 .008 and
P 5 .02, respectively), as shown in Table 4. Patients
who had a low serum albumin level and a high serum LDH level were found to have a significantly
shorter duration of PFS, with a median PFS of only

median PFS ranged from 7.5 to 10.7 months
(P < .0001).

DSS Analysis
As shown in Figure 4, 72 patients (87%) had died of
prostatic SCC at the time of last follow-up, with a
median DSS of 13.1 months (range, 10.7–17.1
months). There was a significant difference noted
with regard to DSS in patients with nonmetastatic
compared with patients with metastatic SCC at the

analysis, potential predictors of DSS included serum
hemoglobin level, log (serum LDH level), log (serum
alkaline phosphatase level), serum albumin level,
prior history of prostatic adenocarcinoma, presence
of metastatic disease at time of SCC diagnosis, and
chemotherapy as the primary treatment of SCC
(Table 5). On multivariate analysis and as shown in
Table 6, only the serum albumin level and log (serum

LDH level) were found to be significant predictors
of the duration of DSS (P 5 .01 and P 5 .02,
respectively).
As shown in Figure 5, patients who had a low serum albumin level and a high serum LDH level had
a significantly shorter duration of DSS, with a median DSS of only 4.1 months, compared with all
other patients whose median DSS durations ranged
from 14.4 to 17.7 months (P < .0001) (Table 7). None
of the patients with nonmetastatic SCC at the time
of diagnosis had both a low serum albumin level and
a high LDH level.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we confirmed the adverse prognosis associated with a diagnosis of SCC of the prostate, demonstrating a disease-specific mortality rate
approaching 90% and a median DSS duration of 13.1
months. Of the clinical and laboratory variables evaluated, elevated serum LDH and low serum albumin

Prostatic Small Cell Carcinoma Treatment/Spiess et al.

levels were identified on multivariate analysis as
being significant predictors of inferior PFS and DSS.
One of the limitations of the current study is that
our patient database was retrospectively collected,
thereby potentially introducing a selection bias into
our study. In a previous study of 38 patients with
SCC of the prostate, performance status, low serum
albumin level, and number of metastatic sites were
identified as predictors of outcome.9 Our larger study
validates the importance of a low serum albumin
level in predicting inferior disease-related outcomes
in this patient population. However, our study could
not validate the prognostic signifcance of performance status in predicting PFS or DSS within this
patient population. In the current study, the use of
systemic chemotherapy was not found to be a predictor of PFS and DSS because the majority of
patients (92%) received it as initial therapy. Patients
with nonmetastatic disease at the time of SCC diagnosis presented at an older age and had a lower serum LDH level compared with patients who had
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis of SCC.
None of the patients with nonmetastatic SCC at the
time of diagnosis were found to have both a low serum albumin and a high serum LDH level, further
supporting the notion that these serologic markers
reflect tumor burden. Furthermore, the results of
the current study clearly demonstrate that patients
with a combination of a low serum albumin level
and a high LDH level at the time of diagnosis have
a poorer PFS and DSS than other patients with SCC
of the prostate. However, the poor prognosis associated with the combination of a low serum albumin level and a high serum LDH level at the time
of diagnosis of SCC may be valid only for patients
with metastatic disease at the time of presentation
with SCC. Previous studies have reported on the
prognostic value of serum LDH11–13 and serum albumin14 levels in other genitourinary organs or
other sites of disease; however, the current study
validates the clinical significance of these variables
for SCC of the prostate.
Although the majority of patients treated at our
institution had metastatic disease at the time of their
diagnosis of SCC, there was a statistically significant
survival benefit to having nonmetastatic disease at
the time of SCC diagnosis. This advantage may
reflect a lead-time bias because of cancer detection
occurring at an earlier stage in its evolution. Another
explanation may be that, in patients who present
with local disease, the disease is biologically different
and is associated with a low serum LDH level and
occurs in older subjects. In support of this argument,
we noted that the median time to metastatic disease

1735

progression in patients with nonmetastatic SCC at
the time of diagnosis was 26 months.
In this retrospective review, we were surprised to
find that only 20% of patients with nonmetastatic
disease at the time of SCC diagnosis received local
therapy in addition to systemic therapy. Although it
is inappropriate to make inferences regarding the
role of local therapy in the management of SCC of
the prostate based on a small number of cases (of
the 21 patients with nonmetastatic disease at the
time of diagnosis, 3 patients underwent a cystoprostatectomy and 1 received definitive external beam
radiotherapy), we and others15 believe that surgical
resection with or without external beam radiotherapy
should be evaluated further as treatment strategies
for select patients with nonmetastatic SCC of the
prostate because they may provide better local control and a potential survival benefit when combined
with systemic therapy compared with systemic therapy alone.
As has been previously published, SCC of the
prostate can appear de novo without a prior history
of prostate cancer or can develop in patients after a
history of prostatic adenocarcinoma, usually of high
grade.2,8 In the current study, approximately twothirds of the patients developed SCC of the prostate
after a prior history of prostatic adenocarcinoma,
and nearly all of these patients had received prior
ADT for a period of several years. Thus, the development of SCC could be the result of adaptive dedifferentiation of prostatic adenocarcinoma subsequent
to treatment with ADT or the selective outgrowth
of rare clonal populations.16 Because the majority
of prostatic adenocarcinomas do not become SCC
subsequent to ADT, it is conceivable that prostate
cancers possess multipotential stem cells that can
manifest as SCC under the selection pressure of
ADT or as-yet unidentified genetic and epigenetic
factors related to the oncologic niche of the tumor.17
Further definition of the molecular phenotype of
pathologically defined SCC may aid in potentially
defining mechanisms of resistance to therapy and
this also may have prognostic and/or predictive
implications.
In conjunction with a report by Rubenstein
et al.,18 the current study demonstrates the propensity for SCC of the prostate to metastasize to visceral
organs, with bone, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, liver,
and lungs being the most common sites of distant
metastasis. Furthermore, the majority of patients in
the current study had a low serum PSA level at the
time of diagnosis of SCC, thereby illustrating the scenario that prostate cancer that does not respond to
conventional treatment regimens or that with un-

usual sites of metastases should be considered as
potentially being of SCC histology, especially if the
serum PSA level is low.19 Although CEA has been previously evaluated as a useful tumor marker in
patients with SCC of the prostate, to our knowledge
it has not been demonstrated to be an independent
predictor of disease-related outcomes.9 In the current
study, we identified elevated serum LDH and low serum albumin levels as important predictors of poor
outcome in patients with metastatic SCC of the prostate. Patients with a low serum albumin level and a
high serum LDH level were found to have median
PFS and DSS durations of 1.3 months and 4.1
months, respectively. This finding clearly illustrates
that this subset of patients has a propensity for rapid
disease progression and death, despite currently
available treatment strategies aimed at palliation,
thus underscoring the need to find more effective
treatment options for these patients.
To our knowledge, the optimal treatment strategy
for SCC of the prostate has yet to be determined.
This uncertainty is largely due to the rarity and
highly aggressive phenotype of this entity, irrespective of treatment approach. The scientific literature
evaluating the treatment outcomes of patients with
SCC of nonprostatic origin reveal that aggressive,
dose-intensified chemotherapy regimens offer a therapeutic benefit, albeit one potentially associated with
increased toxicity.20 Other studies have proposed that
multimodality therapy using a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy may offer an improved
therapeutic benefit.21 In a study of nonmetastatic
SCC of the bladder from our institution, patients
treated with 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(doxorubicin plus ifosfamide alternating with etoposide plus cisplatin) followed by radical cystectomy
yielded a 4-year DSS rate of 70%.22,23 A similar
approach to the management of patients with nonmetastatic SCC of the prostate using systemic therapy with ADT and chemotherapy followed by radical
cystoprostatectomy may improve the outcome of this
subset of patients.
SCC of the prostate represents an aggressive tumor histology that is associated with high diseasespecific mortality. Patients who present with a
low serum albumin level and a high serum LDH level
at the time of initial diagnosis appear to have a dismal prognosis and therefore should be offered alternative therapies as soon as possible after symptom
control is achieved with conventional chemohormonal therapy. For the subgroup of patients with nonmetastatic disease at the time of SCC diagnosis,
there may be a benefit to incorporating local therapies with systemic therapy, but this treatment

approach should be evaluated further in future prospective multicenter trials.
