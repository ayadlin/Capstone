ABSTRACT
Lectins have been recognized as promising carrier molecules for targeted drug
delivery. They specifically bind carbohydrate moieties on cell membranes and trigger
cell internalization. Fungal lectin MpL (Macrolepiota procera lectin) does not provoke
cancer cell cytotoxicity but is able to bind aminopeptidase N (CD13) and integrin
α3β1, two glycoproteins that are overexpressed on the membrane of tumor cells.
Upon binding, MpL is endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner and accumulates
initially in the Golgi apparatus and, finally, in the lysosomes. For effective binding
and internalization a functional binding site on the α-repeat is needed. To test the
potential of MpL as a carrier for delivering protein drugs to cancer cells we constructed
fusion proteins consisting of MpL and the cysteine peptidase inhibitors cystatin C
and clitocypin. The fused proteins followed the same endocytic route as the unlinked
MpL. Peptidase inhibitor-MpL fusions impaired both the intracellular degradation of
extracellular matrix and the invasiveness of cancer cells. MpL is thus shown in vitro
to be a lectin that can enable protein drugs to enter cancer cells, enhance their
internalization and sort them to lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus.

INTRODUCTION

B subunit of ricin, a lectin from the castor bean Ricinus
communis, a canonical member of the β-trefoil-type lectins
[8, 9]. Fungal β-trefoil type lectins exhibit remarkable
diversity in their binding partners, which include
carbohydrates and proteins [6, 10, 11]. MpL is active as a
dimer and possesses a strong carbohydrate binding domain
specific for terminal N-acetyllactosamine and other
β-galactosides on α-repeat and a putative carbohydrate
binding domain with unknown specificity on γ-repeat [7].
Cell membrane proteins and lipids are specifically
glycosylated and, as such, are potential binding sites for
lectins, which could therefore be applied for targeted
delivery of drugs. Since expression of carbohydrate
structures is altered during the progression of cancer,
the lectins distinguish between particular cell subsets
and enable more precise recognition of cancer cells than
do other ligands used in active drug delivery systems
[2, 12, 13]. Besides recognizing specific glycosylation
patterns on cancer cells, some lectins trigger internalization
and can be used to deliver other molecules into the cells
and to sort them to intracellular compartments. The B

Lectins are a structurally diverse group of proteins
that specifically and reversibly bind to carbohydrates.
They act as recognition and adhesion molecules and as
signal transducers involved in a plethora of physiological
functions [1, 2]. They possess at least one carbohydrate
binding domain which, when these domains are
combined, enables their multivalency and cross-linking
of glycoconjugates [1, 3]. The first discovered and the
most extensively investigated are lectins from plants,
however, in recent years fungal lectins have been gaining
more attention [4, 5]. Fungal lectins differ from their
counterparts from other species in their unique structures
and binding specificities [6]. They have shown to be very
stable proteins, resistant to changes in pH and temperature
as well as to proteolytic digestion, which strengthens
their potential for application in biotechnology and
medicine. We have previously isolated and characterized
biochemically a novel lectin from Macrolepiota procera
designated as MpL [7]. MpL is structurally similar to the

subunit of ricin, which enables its entry into cells through
at least six different routes [14, 15], is currently being
investigated as a protein carrier for lysosomal delivery in
enzyme replacement therapy [15].
Lysosomal targets, including peptidases, constitute
a challenge in cancer treatment. The invasiveness of
cancer cells is known to depend on the degradation
of extracellular matrix (ECM), a barrier that prevents
cancer cells from migrating and invading distant sites.
ECM is degraded extracellularly predominantly by
matrix metallopeptidases, however, the process is greatly
accelerated if fragments of ECM proteins are internalized
by cancer cells and ultimately degraded within the
lysosomes. We and others have shown that inhibition
of lysosomal peptidases impairs cancer cell invasion
[16–18]. Cathepsins, lysosomal cysteine peptidases, are
particularly important in this process and can be targeted
in the lysosomes by small inhibitors which can enter the
cells by diffusion, or by specific protein inhibitors, such as
clitocypin and cystatin C. Clitocypin is a fungal inhibitor
of cysteine peptidases that shares the same β-trefoil
fold as MpL and is an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine
peptidases such as papain, cathepsins L, V, S and K, but
a weak inhibitor of cathepsin B [19–21]. Human cystatin
C is a potent inhibitor of papain-like cysteine peptidases,
including cathepsin B [22–24]. However, the ability of
protein inhibitors to enter the cells and localize within
the lysosomes is very low [25]. Delivery systems able to
guide peptidase inhibitors to lysosomes could significantly
enhance cell uptake and increase inhibition of lysosomal
proteolytic activity.
In this study we applied MpL, a recombinant lectin
from Macrolepiota procera, for potential delivery of
peptidase protein inhibitors to lysosomes. We evaluated
the effects of MpL on different cancer cell lines, the
binding partners on cell membrane, the mechanisms of
internalization and its final destination within the cells. In
order to test its potential as a carrier molecule in targeted
delivery we constructed fusion proteins of MpL and
peptidase inhibitors and investigated their cell uptake and
effects on cancer cell invasiveness.

The binding of MpL to cell surface receptors is
dependent on glycan binding as was shown by utilizing
MpL mutants and inhibition assay by lactose (Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure 1). MpL bound to the surface
of HeLa and MCF10A neoT cells almost immediately
after being added to the cell culture medium and, after
15 minutes, the lectin could already be observed inside
the cells (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1). The D109R
mutant, with an inactive binding site on the γ-repeat
and a functional binding site on the α-repeat showed
characteristics regarding cell entry similar to those of the
wild-type MpL, indicating that the binding site on the
α-repeat mediates its internalization. Indeed, the D22R
mutant, with an inactive binding site on the α-repeat, did
not enter the cells (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1).
Similarly, when lactose (0.1 M), a competitive inhibitor
of glycan binding to the MpL’s α-repeat, was added to
the medium, internalization of MpL and D109R was
blocked. The addition of lactose did not, however, affect
the binding of the D22R mutant (Figure 1, Supplementary
Figure 1). Initial weak binding to the cell surface in the
first 30 minutes after addition was observed for D22R
and for all samples that contained lactose (Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure 1), presumably as a result of nonspecific binding. Similar binding and internalization
of MpL was observed in other cell lines tested: PMA
differentiated and non-differentiated U937, NK-92 and
Jurkat cells (Supplementary Figure 2).

Subcellular localization of MpL in human cell
lines
Shortly after internalization, MpL could be observed
in endosomal “dot like” structures and components of the
Golgi apparatus (GA), as shown in HeLa and MCF10A
neoT cells double-labelled with the Golgi apparatus
marker (Golgin-97) and anti-MpL antibodies (Figure 2A,
Supplementary Figure 3A).
MpL is internalized by clathrin-dependent
endocytosis, as shown by employing endocytosis
inhibitors. Inhibition of clathrin-independent endocytosis
by Filipin III (the inhibitor of caveolae formation) had
no effect on MpL uptake (Figure 2A, Supplementary
Figure 3A). However, the inhibition of clathrin-mediated
endocytosis by chlopromazine completely abolished the
uptake of MpL into cells, being co-localized with the
cell membrane labelled with embedded palmitoylated
GFP (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 3B). Similar
accumulation of membrane bound MpL was observed
in the presence of lactose (Figure 2B, Supplementary
Figure  3B). Furthermore, MpL co-localized with
transferrin receptor, a well-established marker of the
clathrin -dependent pathway (Supplementary Figure 4).
Finally, the high rate of internalization of MpL further

RESULTS
Effects of MpL on different human cell lines
Given that MpL has been reported to be toxic towards
the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [7] we tested its
effects on different human cell lines. In the viability loss assay
MpL was shown to be non-toxic to any of the suspension
cells (NK-92, Jurkat, non-differentiated U937 cells), and
adherent cells (HeLa, HepG2, SH-SY5Y, MCF10A neoT and
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) differentiated U937
cells) at three different concentrations (0.2 μM, 1 μM and 5
μM) and at three different time points (48 h, 72 h and 96 h)
(Table 1, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).

supports clathrin -mediated endocytosis, since it is
considered to be a process around 100 fold faster than that
of clathrin -independent, especially caveolae-dependent,
endocytosis (t1/2 ≤ 20 min) [26].
The blockade of retrograde transport from early
endosomes to Golgi apparatus by Retro-2 caused a
decrease in the accumulation of MpL in the Golgi
apparatus (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 3C). Staining
the acidic sub-cellular compartments with LysoTracker
Red DND-99 upon the blockade of retrograde transport
with Retro-2 showed a significant co-localization with
FITC labeled MpL after 3h incubation (Supplementary
Figure 3E).
MpL was retained in endo/lysosomal compartments for
an extended period of time (24 h) in both HeLa (Figure 2D)
and MCF10A neoT cells (Supplementary Figure 3D).

covered were secreted glycosylated proteins zinc-alpha-2
glycoprotein and fibronectin.
MpL and aminopeptidase N (CD13) co-localize
in MCF10A neoT cells (Figure 3A). The co-localization
was observed 60 min after addition of the lectin and
increased with time, revealing a significant co-localization
signal, mostly intracellularly. At the beginning of the
experiment only a small portion of aminopeptidase N was
detected intracellularly, indicating that MpL increased its
internalization rate.
MpL co-localizes with the β1 integrin subunit in
MCF10A neoT (Figure 3B) and HeLa cells (not shown)
shortly after its addition to the cell culture medium.
Antibody raised against the β1 subunit was used to analyse
the subcellular distribution of α3β1 integrin as the β1
integrin subunit assembles with α3 integrin subunit to form
heterodimeric receptors [27] and only these two integrin
isoforms were identified by co-immunoprecipitation with
MpL. Within a few minutes co-localisation occurred,
presumably on the cell membrane whereas, after 15 min,
both proteins could be seen intracellularly. After 30 min
the extent of co-localization did not change and remained
the same throughout the experiment (3 h). Part of the β1
integrin, however, remained on the cell’s membrane.

MpL binds to different glycosylated proteins on
the cell surface membrane
Three glycosylated membrane proteins and two
secreted glycosylated proteins were identified as targets
of MpL on MCF10A neoT cells (Table 2). In order to
determine specific MpL targets, the MCF10A neoT cell
membrane fraction was isolated and incubated with MpL,
resulting in complexes by co-immunoprecipitation.
Comparison of the co-immunoprecipitates formed in the
absence or presence of lactose revealed three major bands
corresponding to target proteins of MpL on MCF10A
neoT cells (Supplementary Figure 5). The best protein
coverage was obtained through mass fingerprinting for
aminopeptidase N (CD13), isoform α3A of integrin α3
(CD49c), and isoform β1A of integrin β1 (CD29). These
three targets are cell membrane proteins with known
glycosylation sites for the potential binding of MpL.
Co-immunoprecipitation of aminopeptidase N, (CD13)
and integrin β1 (CD29) with MpL was confirmed by
western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure 5). Less well

Effects of fusion proteins CysC-MpL and CltMpL on invasion of MCF10A neoT cells
In order to explore the potential of MpL for
delivering biological drugs to their intracellular targets
we constructed two recombinant fusion proteins: MpL
with each of the peptidase inhibitors clitocypin (Clt-MpL)
and cystatin C (CysC-MpL). Clitocypin (Clt, Uniprot ID:
Q3Y9I6) and cystatin C (CysC, UniProt ID: P01034) have
both a low molecular weight – cystatin C of 13.4 kDa
and clitocypin of 16.7 kDa – and are therefore suitable
for constructing fusions. Furthermore, cystatin C is by 2
to 4 orders of magnitude more potent cysteine cathepsin

inhibitor compared to clitocypin. Peptidase inhibitor
(N-terminal part of fusion) was connected to the lectin
domain (C-terminal part of fusion) with a long flexible
peptide linker (GGGGS)3, forming the N-terminal region
of fusion as described [28] and ensuring the retention of
integrity/activity of both subunits. Both fusion proteins,
Clt-MpL and CysC-MpL, were expressed in E. coli and
purified (Figure 4A).
Both the lectin and peptidase inhibitor domains of
fusions were active, as determined by haemagglutination
assay and by measuring their inhibitory activity against
the cysteine peptidase papain. CysC-MpL agglutinated
human blood group B erythrocytes, whereas CltMpL did not, even at 6.6 µM (Figure 4B). However,
immunocytochemical analysis, using anti-MpL specific
antibodies, showed that Clt-MpL entered the subcellular
compartments of HeLa (not shown) and MCF10A neoT
cells (Supplementary Figure 6B), indicating that its lectin
domain is active. CysC-MpL and Clt-MpL were active
against papain with a constant of inhibition (Ki) in the
range of those determined for unlinked CysC and Clt
(Figure 4B).
Both fusions, CysC-MpL and Clt-MpL, entered
MCF10A neoT cells (Supplementary Figure 6) and HeLa
cells (not shown) in a fashion similar to that of unlinked
MpL. Shortly after addition, CysC-MpL (Supplementary
Figure 6A) and Clt-MpL (Supplementary Figure 6B) entered
the MCF10A neoT cells and co-localized with components
of GA whereas, after prolonged incubation, they were
present in the endo/lysosomal system. As for MpL, both

fusions were retained in the endo/lysosomal compartments
for an extended time period (Supplementary Figure 6).
Further, we tested the effects of CysC-MpL and CltMpL fusions on the activity of the intracellular peptidases
cathepsin B and L (Supplementary Figure 7). Activity
was measured in whole cell lysates prepared from cells
treated with either fusion protein or with MpL, alone or
in combination with each peptidase inhibitor, for one or
two hours. The activity of cathepsin L was inhibited only
in cells treated with CysC-MpL fusion (̴ 18% inhibition
of activity compared to that of control). The activity of
cathepsin B was reduced in cells treated with: CysC-MpL
fusion (5.5% inhibition), a combination of unlinked CysC
and MpL (̴ 10% inhibition), and a combination of unlinked
Clt and MpL (11% inhibition). In the cell lysates treated
with Clt and CysC alone no change in the activity of
cathepsins B and L was detected.
Reducing intracellular ECM degradation by
internalized peptidase inhibitors may decrease the
invasion of tumor cells through Matrigel. We analysed
the intracellular degradation of ECM by following DQcollagen IV in MCF10A neoT cells treated with fusion
proteins, MpL alone or in combination with each peptidase
inhibitor. Flow cytometric analysis showed a significant
reduction of DQ-collagen IV degradation in the cells
treated with CysC-MpL fusion, similar to the effect of
intracellular protease inhibitor E64d (Figure 5) whereas
Clt-MpL fusion was not effective (not shown).
In next step we examined the effects of MpL fusions
on the invasion of MCF10A neoT cells, which are a

model of aggressive breast cancer cells. In the assay, their
invasion relies on effective degradation of Matrigel coating,
a gelatinous protein mixture resembling the ECM. Both
fusions reduced the invasion of MCF10A neoT cells through
Matrigel (Figure 6, invasion graphs). In particular, the
CysC-MpL fusion lowered the invasion speed significantly
(slopes of linear regression curves) and the cumulative
number of invaded cells (area under curve) as compared
to control (Figure 6A, right column graphs, Supplementary
Figure 8). Its effect were even more pronounced than
the effect of intracellular protease inhibitor E64d
(Supplementary Figure 8). The use of unlinked CysC and

MpL alone resulted in speeds of invasion and cumulative
numbers of invaded cells comparable to those of controls,
whereas the combination of unlinked CysC and MpL led
to a reduced cumulative number of invaded cells, due to
lower invasion speed at the beginning of the experiment
(Figure 6A, right column graphs, Supplementary Figure 8).
Clt-MpL fusion also lowered the invasion speed and the
cumulative number of invaded cells (Figure 6B, right
column graphs) although the effect was not as pronounced
as in the case of CysC-MpL. The combination of unlinked
Clt and MpL did not change significantly either the invasion
speed or the cumulative number of invaded cells.

vesicles (Figure 7). Similar binding and internalization
behaviour was also demonstrated for MpL when it was
fused with other proteins. The fusion of MpL with cysteine
peptidase inhibitors significantly improved their delivery
to endo/lysosomal vesicles, resulting in greatly reduced
degradation of ECM by their lysosomal targets, cysteine
cathepsins, and consequently decreased the migration and
invasiveness of cancer cells.
MpL differs from other fungal entomotoxic and
nematotoxic β-galactoside-binding lectins, which were
shown to have negative effects on the proliferation of
mammalian cell lines [6]. Treatment of human cell lines
showed that, even at fairly high concentrations, MpL has
no effect on cell viability/proliferation, but is rapidly
internalized and accumulated within certain subcellular
compartments. Internalization of MpL by human cells
depends on the functional binding site on the α-repeat,
while the nematotoxicity of MpL has been linked to
the γ-binding site with unknown carbohydrate binding
specificity. A similar nematotoxic β-trefoil type lectin,
CNL, exhibits an antiproliferative effect against human
cell lines specific for leukemic T cells and dependent on
carbohydrate binding on the α-repeat [34]. Furthermore,
the β-galactoside binding, actinoporin-type lectins XCL
and ABL, the former also highly toxic to insects, showed
antiproliferative effects on various mammalian cell lines
[35–37].
MpL is rapidly internalized into various human
cell lines. Shortly after internalization the majority of
MpL co-localized strongly with a signal labelling the
components of GA (Figure 7). The same route from early
endosomes towards the components of GA, i.e. the transGolgi network (TGN) but continuing to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) has been shown for the plant toxin ricin [8]

and the bacterial Shiga toxins [38, 39]. The inhibition of
the retrograde transport revealed the existence of another,
apparently slower targeting pathway sorting MpL to
lysosomal vesicles. Furthermore, co-localisation of MpL
with the endo/lysosomal marker LysoTracker, following
prolonged incubation in HeLa and MCF10A neoT cells,
showed that, once internalized, MpL is retained within the
acidic subcellular compartments for at least 24 h hours.
Similarly, the β-galactoside-binding lectins XCL and ABL
were located at their respective intracellular localization
sites after 16 h and 24 h, respectively [37, 40].
Small differences in carbohydrate binding
specificity apparently influence the intracellular routing
and final destinations of lectins in the cell. MpL, specific
for terminal N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1,4GlcNAc),
localizes to GA and the endo/lysosomal system. Similarly,
mammalian galectin-1, which binds to long poly-Nacetyllactosamine chains, localizes in the Golgi system
but then disappears, without accumulation in lysosomes
[41,  42]. Lectin XCL, that binds specifically Galβ1,
3GalNAc-containing glycans localizes to late endosomes
and lysosomes, but not to GA [40]. On the other hand,
lectin ABL, with apparently the same glycan-bindingspecificity as XCL, shows perinuclear accumulation in
membrane bound vesicles [37]. Furthermore, the fungal
chimerolectin, MOA, specific for Galα1, 3-containing
structures, accumulates in late endosomes and does not
localize in either of the early endosomes, GA or ER [43].
Despite their different intracellular sorting, fungal lectins
MpL, XCL [40], ABL [37] and MOA [43] still exploit
clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The latter two, however,
also utilize clathrin-independent pathways [37].
MpL is internalized via clathrin-mediated
endocytosis and the binding target on the cell membrane

probably influences its intracellular sorting and
final destination. Clathrin-coated pits can be formed
spontaneously and in the absence of ligand, but their
stabilization and endocytosis is a ligand/receptor
dependent process [44]. We therefore hypothesized that
MpL is endocytosed via ligand induced internalization of
a glycosylated receptor(s). MpL could mimic a ligand by
inducing receptor dimerization leading to internalization
of ligand-receptor in clathrin-coated vesicles, or it could
bind to lipid raft associated glycolipids and be internalized
by the same clathrin-dependent pathway. The latter
mechanism of entry has already been shown for Shiga
and Cholera toxins [14, 45]. Glycolipids were excluded
as binding targets of MpL (not shown) using lectin blot on
thin layer chromatography as described [46].
Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
revealed several potential MpL binding glycoproteins on
MCF10A neoT cells, a model cell line of aggressive breast
cancer. The strongest target appears to be aminopeptidase
N (CD13) which is a 120 kDa glycosylated protein that
carries both N- and O-linked glycans.
Aminopeptidase N is a metallopeptidase involved
in proteolytic processing of various extracellular
proteins, however, independent of its enzymatic activity,
aminopeptidase N has been implicated in the regulation of
processes such as angiogenesis, antigen presentation, cellto-cell adhesion and infection with corona viruses [47–49].
The co-localisation of aminopeptidase N and MpL in
MCF10A neoT cells was weak at shorter time points
(≤ 60 min), however, with prolonged incubation (4 h) the
co-localization signal increased within endo/lysosomal
‘dot-like’ structures, suggesting an increase in the
internalization of the aminopeptidase N. Aminopeptidase

N is normally endocytosed by constitutive/physiological
sorting mechanisms [49]. In polarized epithelial cells
(HepG2, human liver cancer cells) it was found targeted
into distinct sorting endosomes and, eventually, into endo/
lysosomes in a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent manner
[50]. The dynamics of this process are in accordance with
slow endo/lysosomal targeting of MpL. Furthermore,
it was shown that the internalization of aminopeptidase
N can be triggered by binding of Abs [51], coronavirus,
drugs [48], or CD13-targeted vesicles [49]. In contrast,
human galectin 3, which specifically binds poly-Nacetyllactosamine (repeating -3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1- units)
and is another strong aminopeptidase N ligand, failed to
induce its internalization [42, 47].
Apart from aminopeptidase N, MpL also bound
α3β1 integrin receptor (Figure 7), a protein that is
overexpressed in breast cancer cells [32, 33]. Integrins
are a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors
mediating adhesion of cells to the proteins of ECM.
Binding of MpL to the integrin receptor caused its partial
internalization and rapid translocation towards GA-like
structures. Integrins have very dynamic structures and
are constantly endocytosed from the plasma membrane
by formation of clathrin-coated pits, caveolin vesicles or
lipid rafts [52]. From early endosomes integrins recycle
back to the plasma membrane through endosomes and
the perinuclear recycling endosomes or they recycle
directly from early endosomes [52]. However, it was
recently shown that in HeLa cells endocytosed integrins
traffic from recycling endosomes to the TGN and that a
component of TGN plays a rate-limiting role in integrin
trafficking [52]. Internalization of α3β1 integrin can also
be induced with specific Abs [53] as well as by binding to

Figure 7: Schematic representation of MpL internalization and subcellular localization in cancer cells. MpL can enhance
internalization of protein drugs to cancer cells and guide them to lysosomes and/or Golgi apparatus, by binding to aminopeptidase N and/
or integrin α3β1.

galectin 3 [54]. Therefore, we hypothesize that binding to
integrins and recycling through TGN could explain fast
internalization and targeting of MpL to components of
GA. Fast internalization has been observed also for the
lectin MOA that induces internalization and degradation
of integrin β1, however it is not clear whether MOA binds
integrin β1 directly [43].
Finally, two secreted proteins were detected as MpL
targets: fibronectin and zinc-alpha-2 glycoprotein. The
former is the extracellular matrix component and the latter
the signalling molecule. Even though they appear to be
irrelevant to the process of MpL internalization we can
hypothesize that MpL could crosslink these components
and receptors on the cell surface, potentially leading to
their internalization. Furthermore, U937 cell line showed
reduced adhesion to fibronectin when treated by MpL
at 1.5 μM as determined by a real-time cell analysis
(not shown). Nevertheless, the possibility that these two
proteins are contaminants from the membrane purification
protocol could not be excluded.
The ability of MpL to bind tumor-associated
proteins and to induce uptake by cells can be explored
to deliver biological drugs to their intracellular targets.
This hypothesis has been tested on cysteine cathepsins,
lysosomal peptidases, involved in tumor migration,
invasion and metastasis. Cysteine cathepsins, the most
prominent one in cancer being cathepsin B, are involved
in the degradation of the ECM proteins (type IV collagen,
laminin and fibronectin), thus facilitating growth and
invasion of tumor cells into surrounding tissue and
vasculature. After partial extracellular degradation ECM
fragments are internalized to tumor cells and completely
degraded in lysosomes by cathepsin B and other peptidases
[16, 55]. We have demonstrated that low molecular weight
inhibitors of cathepsin B, able to inactivate both intra- and
extracellular fractions of cathepsin B, effectively impair
tumor progression [18]. The same holds for endogenous
protein inhibitors cystatins [56], however, their uptake
by cells and transport to lysosomes limits their effective
inhibition. To enhance the delivery of cystatins to
lysosomes therefore, we created fusion proteins of MpL
and cystatin C (CysC) and clitocypin (Clt). The fusions
followed the same internalization route as unlinked MpL
(Supplementary Figure 6) and, moreover, retained strong
inhibitory potential towards their proteolytic targets.
We showed that both CysC-MpL and Clt-MpL
fusions significantly inhibited Matrigel invasion by
MCF10A neoT cells and that the effect of the former
was more pronounced, most probably due to the fact
that cystatin C is a stronger inhibitor of cathepsin B than
clitocypin. Inhibition of migration of MCF10A neoT
cells in the absence of Matrigel by CysC-MpL fusion
indicated that both cell migration and extracellular matrix
degradation is reduced by addition of the fusion protein
(Supplementary Figure 9). The stronger effect of CysCMpL fusion on cell invasion was confirmed by flow
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cytometry, which showed a significant decrease of DQcollagen IV degradation only in cells treated with CysCMpL. As a final point, the partial inhibition of MCF10A
neoT invasion upon treatment with the combination of
non-fused inhibitor cystatin C and MpL indicated that
incubation with lectin can facilitate endocytosis of other
molecules present in the medium. Similarly, it has been
shown that the fungal lectin XCL stimulates the uptake
of poorly internalized molecules via a clathrin-dependent
mechanism [40].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recombinant proteins
Active recombinant fungal lectin MpL and its
carbohydrate-binding mutants D22R-MpL (D22R) and
D109R-MpL (D109R) were expressed in Escherichia coli
and purified as described [7].
Active recombinant cystatin C (CysC, GenBank
accession number: CR542018) without its signal peptide
of 26 amino acids was expressed in E. coli. The CysCcoding sequence was amplified using Phusion Hot Start
II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) and primers introducing NdeI
(rCysC-NdeI-F) and BamHI (rCysC-BamHI-R-no
fusion) restriction sites (Supplementary Table 1). The
fragment was subcloned into an appropriately linearized
pET11a expression vector (Novagen, WI, USA). For
heterologous expression E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed
with plasmid pET11a::CysC was cultivated in LB medium
supplemented with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin, induced with
1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside when the
OD600 reached 0.5 then grown for 6 h at 37°C. Bacterial
cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g, 20 min,
4°C; RC-5C Plus, Sorval) and resuspended in 50 mM TrisHCl, 2 mM EDTA (Serva, Germany), 0.1% Triton X-100
(pH 9), sonicated for 15 min and centrifuged again (12000
× g, 20 min, 4 °C). The pellet was suspended in 50 mM
Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 6 M Urea (pH 9) and dialysed
against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9). Recombinant CysC was
purified using DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange column
equilibrated with the same buffer. Unbound fractions
were collected, dialysed against phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon UM-3).
Recombinant clitocypin (Clt) was expressed in E.
coli and purified as described [19].

Construction, expression and purification of
recombinant fusion proteins
Two fusions of peptidase inhibitor and lectin
connected by a spacer peptide (GGGGS)3 were
constructed: Clt-MpL and CysC-MpL. Since N-terminus is
essential for inhibitory activity of Cystatin C, N-terminal
fusion to MpL was designed for both protease inhibitors.

Coding sequences of peptidase inhibitor (Genbank
accession numbers: DQ150588 for rClt and CR542018
for CysC) and lectin rMpL (GenBank accession number:
HQ449739) were amplified with Phusion Hot Start II
High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific)
and the corresponding primers (Supplementary Table
1) in a two-step PCR to incorporate restriction sites and
sequences that code for parts of the linker peptide. The
resulting fragments coding for a peptidase inhibitor and
lectin were subcloned into pET22b expression vector
(Novagen), yielding fusions linking peptidase inhibitor
(Clt or CysC) to lectin MpL. These fusions were
then heterologously expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3),
transformed with the constructed expression vectors as
described above for recombinant CysC and were purified
as described [7]. As previously published for MpL mutants
and fusion proteins dimeric forms were observed [7].

MTS cell viability loss assay seeding number of viable
cells per well was 3 × 104 (Jurkat, NK-92 and nondifferentiated U937), 0.7 × 104 (HepG2, SH-SY5Y, HeLa
and MCF10A neoT) and 6 × 104 PMA differentiated
U937. Cells were maintained in the appropriate culture
media. Lectin (0.2 μM, 1 μM and 5 μM) was added to
the cells in 96-well plates and viability was assessed after
48 h, 72 h and 96 h.

Immunofluorescence staining
Lectin MpL or MpL fusions (0.63 μM) were added
to media of coverslip-attached adherent or to suspension
cell lines. At different times after the addition of proteins
the coverslip-attached cells were washed with PBS and the
suspension cells washed with PBS and centrifuged (Stat
Spin Cytofuge, StatSpin, Iris International) onto glass
slides. The cells were fixed and permeabilized by 10 min
incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy
Sciences) in PBS following 10 min incubation in 0.1%
Triton X-100 in PBS. For labelling with antibodies against
aminopeptidase N (CD13), the cells were fixed for 10 min
in ice cold methanol and permeabilized for 5 min in ice
cold acetone. Non-specific staining was blocked with 3%
BSA in PBS for 1 h. Cells were labelled with primary and
secondary antibodies, each time for 1 hour in 3% BSA in
PBS. The following primary antibodies were used: affinitypurified rabbit anti-MpL antibody (2 μg/ml, BioGenes,
Germany), mouse monoclonal anti-human Golgin-97
antibody (0.5 μg/ml, Life Technologies, CA, USA), mouse
monoclonal anti-human CD13 antibody (12.5 μg/ml, R&D
Systems, MN, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-human
CD29 antibody (12.5 μg/ml, R&D Systems), and mouse
monoclonal anti-human CD71 antibody (5 μg/ml, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, USA). The secondary antibodies used
were goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with Alexa
Fluor 555 (2.5 μg/ml, A-21428), goat anti-rabbit antibodies
conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (2.5 μg/ml, A-11070) and
donkey anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor
555 (2.5 μg/ml, A-31570); all were purchased from Life
Technologies. Cells were washed three times with PBS
after each of the performed steps. The acidic intracellular
compartments of cells were stained by 40 min incubation
with 60 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (InvitrogenThermo Scientific) prior to paraformaldehyde fixing.
Cells were mounted on slides with Prolong Gold Antifade
Reagent containing nuclear 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) stain (Thermo Scientific).
Membranes were labelled with membraneembedded palmitoylated green fluorescent protein,
coded by pCAG-GFP plasmid (Addgene, MA, USA).
Transfection of cells was done one day in advance
with Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Life Technologies),
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The inhibition of lectin binding and/or its
internalization was achieved by pre-incubation of

Functional analysis of recombinant fusions
The functionality of both protein domains of
recombinant fusions CysC-MpL and Clt-MpL was
analysed. A hemagglutination assay was first performed to
determine the activity of the lectin domain, using human
blood group B erythrocytes as described [57]. Secondly,
the inhibitory activity of CysC-MpL, Clt-MpL and CysC
against papain (Sigma, MO, USA) was determined.
The constant of inhibition (Ki) was determined
according to Henderson linear equation [58] for tight
binding competitive inhibitors. Papain activity (2.6 nM final
concentration) following addition of different concentrations
of proteins was measured in 0.1 M MES buffer
(Sigma), 5 mM DTT (Fermentas, MD, USA), 0.1 mM
benzoyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-(4-methyl) coumarylamide
(Bachem, Switzerland), pH 6.5. The assay was carried out
at 25°C and fluorescence measured at excitation/emission
wavelengths of 370/460 nm on a microplate reader Infinite
M1000 (Tecan Group, Switzerland).

Viability assay
The viability of different cell lines following
addition of protein samples was assessed using the
MTS assay CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human cell
lines used were: non-differentiated and PMA differentiated
histiocytic lymphoma cells (U937: ATCC number CRL1593.2), malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NK-92:
ATCC number CRL-2407), leukemic T cells (Jurkat:
ATCC number TIB-152), hepatocellular carcinoma cells
(HepG2: ATCC number 59195), neuroblastoma cells
(SH-SY5Y; ATCC number CRL-2266), cervical cancer
cells (HeLa: ATCC number CCL-2) and Ras-transformed

inhibition of clathrin-independent caveolar endocytosis
and Retro-2 (20 μM, Millipore, Germany) for inhibition
of retrograde transport. All inhibitors were added to the
cells 1 hour prior to treatment with proteins.
Immunostained cells were visualized with an LSM710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped
with UV (405 nm), Argon (488 nm and 514 nm) and HeNe
(543 nm and 633 nm) lasers. The images were acquired
and processed using ZEN software (Carl Zeiss).

they were resuspended in fractionation buffer [250  mM
sucrose, 20 mM Hepes, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
1  mM EDTA (Serva), 1 mM EGTA (Fluka, Germany),
1 mM DTT, pH 7.4] with the protease inhibitor cocktail
cOmplete™ ULTRA Tablets (Roche, Switzerland). All
subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were passed
through a 27-gauge needle 10 times then lysed in a Dounce
homogeniser with 5 pestle strokes. Cell lysate was incubated
for 20 min before centrifugation (5 min, 720 × g). The pellet
was washed with fresh fractionation buffer, passed through
the 27-gauge needle 10 times and centrifuged again (10 min,
720 × g). Two supernatants were combined and centrifuged
(20 min, 12000 × g). The resulting supernatant was subjected
to centrifugation in a Centrikon T-2070 ultracentrifuge
(Kontron Instruments, Germany) in a TST 28.38 rotor for
45 min at 100000 × g. The pellet was resuspended, passed
through a 27-gauge needle 10 times and centrifuged again
(45 min, 100000 × g). The pellet was dissolved in lysis
buffer [50 mM Hepes, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) NP-40
(Igepal CA-630, Sigma), pH 7].
Membrane protein samples (50 μl) were then
incubated with MpL (2 μg) in lysis buffer with or
without lactose (0.05 M). MpL-target complexes were
co-immunoprecipitated with magnetic nanoparticles
Dynabeads® Protein G (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Empty nanoparticles (25 μl)
were labelled with 6 μg of affinity purified rabbit antiMpL (Biogenes) for isolation of MpL complexes. Labelled
nanoparticles were added to mixtures of membrane protein
samples preincubated with lectin and incubated for 30 min
on tube rotator. Nanoparticles were heated for 10 min at 95°C
in SDS sample buffer with 20 mM DTT and the proteins
resolved on precast 8% Precise™ Tris-Glycine gels (Thermo
Scientific). Gels were silver stained, individual bands
excised and, following in-gel trypsin digestion, identified by
mass spectroscopy fingerprinting using an Orbitrap linear
trap quadrupole (LTQ) Velos mass spectrometer coupled to
a Proxeon nano-LC HPLC unit, (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). Results were analysed using Scaffold
MS software (Proteome Software).
For immunodetection, co-immunoprecipitated MpLtarget complexes were resolved on precast 8% Precise™
Tris-Glycine gels and transferred (for 4 h at 4°C) onto
PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in
5% non-fat dry milk in tris-buffered saline (TBS) with
0.5% Tween-20. Primary antibodies (anti-human CD13
antibody (2 μg/ml, R&D Systems), and mouse monoclonal
anti-human CD29 antibody (1 μg/ml, R&D Systems)
diluted in blocking solution were incubated overnight
at 4°C. Antibody-reactive proteins were detected by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary anti mouse antibodies (1 : 5000, Jackson
ImmunoResearch laboratories. Inc) in blocking solution
for 1h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with
LumiLight Plus WesternBlotting substrate (Roche) and
images were acquired using a GelDoc System (Bio-Rad).

Inhibition of intracellular peptidases
The inhibition of intracellular peptidases upon
addition of proteins was measured in MCF10A neoT whole
cell lysates. Cells in tissue culture treated 6-well plates
were incubated for one and two hours in the presence of
10 μM E64d (Sigma), fusions, MpL, peptidase inhibitor
(Clt or CysC) and a combination of unlinked MpL and
peptidase inhibitor. All experiments were done in triplicate.
The cells were then washed twice in PBS and detached
with dissociating reagent TrypLE Select (Gibco, Thermo
Scientific). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C.
Cells were centrifuged (300 × g) and washed twice in
PBS. Cell pellets were then resuspended in whole cell
lysis buffer [50 mM Hepes, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v)
NP-40 (Igepal CA-630, Sigma), pH 7] and incubated for
10 minutes. Lysed cells were centrifuged (14000 × g) and
the pellet discarded. Protein concentration was determined
with DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cathepsin B
and L activity was measured in whole cell lysates (9 μg).
Each lysate was analysed in triplicate. Lysates were
incubated in black 96-well plates for 10 min before the
addition of substrate in 100 mM Hepes, 2 mM EDTA,
5 mM DTT, pH 5 (cathepsin B) or pH 6.5 (cathepsin L). The
benzoyloxycarbonyl-Arg-Arg-7-(4-methyl)coumarylamide
substrate (20 μM, Bachem) and the benzoyloxycarbonylPhe-Arg-7-(4-methyl)coumarylamide substrate (50 μM,
Bachem) were added to measure cathepsin B and L
activity, respectively. Kinetics were measured (30 min)
at 30 °C, at excitation/emission wavelengths of 370/460
nm on a microplate reader Infinite M1000 (Tecan). Data
were analysed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Slopes
of linear regression curves were calculated and statistical
difference was determined using Student’s t-test.

DQ-collagen IV degradation
The effect of fusion proteins and of combinations of
proteins on intracellular DQ-collagen IV degradation was
assessed according to the protocol described in Mirković
et al., [60]. 5 × 104 MCF10A neoT cells were plated into
the wells of a 24-well plate. Cells were allowed to attach
overnight, when the media were replaced with serum free
medium containing 10 μM E64d, 0.63 μM of recombinant
fusions or combinations of proteins. After 4 h incubation,
DQ-collagen IV (5 µg/ml, Invitrogen) was added and
the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. Propidium
iodide (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) exclusion was used
to monitor just the viable cells. The measurements were
performed on a BD FACS Calibur instrument (Beckton
Dickinson, Inc.), analysis using FlowJo software (FlowJO,
Ashland, OR, USA).

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, fungal lectin MpL has been shown
not to be toxic to human cell lines despite its rapid
internalization and sorting to Golgi apparatus and
lysosomes, where prolonged retention was observed.
For recognition of cell membrane glycoproteins the
functional binding site on the α-repeat subunit is needed.
The properties of MpL remain preserved when it is fused
with other proteins, designating it as a promising carrier
of protein drugs to intracellular targets. Facilitated uptake
of other molecules by MpL could be of great value for
various biomedical and biotechnological applications.
