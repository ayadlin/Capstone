BACKGROUND: Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are commonly noted in pediatric oncology services. Radiotherapy is effective at controlling tumors, but has many undesirable late effects, especially in patients with neurofibromatosis. Chemotherapy is commonly used
to preserve vision and delay or eliminate the need for radiotherapy. Despite visual threat being a common reason to initiate chemotherapy in patients with OPG, reports of visual outcome after chemotherapy are not common and reports of long-term visual outcome are even scarcer. METHODS: In a single institution, all patients with OPG who had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy
between 1996 and 2013 were identified from hospital databases. Visual, treatment, and radiological data were recorded. Categorized
visual acuity was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Of 43 patients identified, visual data were available for 42 patients.
Approximately 14% of patients experienced an improvement in visual acuity during therapy, 9% of patients experienced a deterioration, and the remainder were stable. At a mean follow-up of 78 months, 26% of patients were legally blind. Children aged <2 years
and patients with a chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumor site were overrepresented in this category. An intraconal location was predictive
of poor visual outcome for that eye but was unilateral with normal vision in the contralateral eye. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for
long-term visual deterioration are young age, chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumor site, and intraconal tumor site for the involved eye. The
most common visual outcome for children with OPG after treatment with chemotherapy is stability. This stability is maintained over

INTRODUCTION
Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are frequently noted in pediatric oncology services, particularly among children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1).1,2 They have a variable natural history including the possibility of spontaneous regression
or indefinite stability, but cases of dissemination or death from direct invasion of vital structures is well described.3
Although overall survival is excellent, patients with these tumors frequently require multiple lines of therapy during childhood to minimize long-term sequelae of unchecked tumor growth.4 Extent of surgical resection is a strong determinant of
outcome for pediatric low-grade glioma in all anatomic locations,5 but optic pathway tumors are generally not amenable
to complete resection without significant sequelae.
There are many options for the nonsurgical treatment of OPGs. Radiotherapy has been used for this indication for >60
years,6 but the late effects of radiotherapy can be severe, particularly in children with NF-1.7,8 In general, radiotherapy is avoided
if possible, even in children without NF-1, and chemotherapy is preferentially used to stabilize or reduce tumor bulk.
The indication to initiate treatment in pediatric patients with low-grade glioma is based on an actual or anticipated
threat to vital structures. For patients with OPGs, this generally involves a threat to visual function and/or central structures such as the hypothalamus.9 In the majority of cases when treatment is initiated for OPG, damage or threat to the
visual pathway is at least one of the reasons for starting treatment.10,11 Poor vision caused by OPGs, particularly when
both eyes are affected, is associated with poorer quality of life12 and preserving or improving vision with chemotherapy is
certainly a reasonable aim.

Visual Outcome for OPG/Dodgshun et al

Reports of visual outcomes after treatment with
chemotherapy for OPG are not common. A systematic
review published in 2010 of postchemotherapy visual outcome found only 8 publications to include in the analysis.13 The authors reported on 174 children in the analysis
who received chemotherapy for OPGs, 14.4% of whom
experienced an improvement in vision after chemotherapy, 47.1% of whom remained stable, and 38.5% of
whom experienced a deterioration in vision.
Since the publication of that study, there have
been several other reports published concerning visual
outcome. The largest to the best of our knowledge was a
multicenter retrospective review from North America
that included only patients with NF-1 who were treated
with chemotherapy for OPG.14 Of 88 subjects, 32%
had improvement in visual acuity (VA) at the end of
treatment, 40% remained stable, and 28% declined.
The authors also found a poor correlation between
radiographic response and visual outcome. This is in
keeping with our own previous experience.15 Other
publications have found similar rates, with the most
common outcome after chemotherapy being stability of
vision.16,17
To our knowledge, reports of long-term visual outcomes after chemotherapy are scarce. A small series was
published in 2007 that reported long-term visual outcomes in 20 children with NF-1 and OPG, 11 of whom
received chemotherapy.18 Although some patients
achieved long-term stability at a mean follow-up of 6
years and 9 months, many patients went on to experience
significant and ongoing deterioration in vision. It was
not clear over what time period these deteriorations
occurred and what the initial visual response to chemotherapy was. Another report of 17 children, 7 of whom
had NF-1, demonstrated a subset of patients with
ongoing deterioration at long-term follow-up but the
majority achieved long-term stability in vision.13 Kelly
et al reported on 18 patients with OPG who were treated
with chemotherapy, and found that chemotherapy
arrested the pretreatment decline in VA and stabilized
vision for an average of 5 years.19 Campagna et al
reported on 32 children with OPG without NF-1, 15 of
whom had received chemotherapy.17 The majority of
patients in the series had an overall deterioration in
vision between the initiation of treatment and the time
of last follow-up.
In the current study, we sought to assess the shortterm and long-term visual outcome of children receiving
treatment for OPG in a single institution over an 18-year
period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We identified all children diagnosed with glioma between
1996 and 2013 from hospital databases. We viewed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to determine tumor
location. Patients were included if they had tumor
involvement of any site of the optic pathway and had
received chemotherapy. Biopsy-proven low-grade gliomas
were included as were unbiopsied tumors in cases in
which the child had NF-1 and the radiologic findings
were consistent with low-grade glioma. We determined
sites by laterality and location, dividing them into intraconal, intracanalicular, intracranial prechiasmatic, chiasmatic, chiasmatic/hypothalamic, optic tract, and optic
radiation. Many tumors had multiple sites, either contiguous or noncontiguous, and these were recorded.
Chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors were defined as having
chiasmatic involvement in addition to direct extension
into the hypothalamus or basal ganglia.
With reference to clinical notes, we recorded VA data
from immediately before treatment, immediately after
treatment, and then over time until the last recorded
follow-up. VA measurements were made by ophthalmology staff using logMAR charts (developed by the National
Vision Research Institute of Australia) or the Kay Picture
Test (Kay Pictures Ltd, Tring, Hertfordshire, UK) depending on the patient’s age and ability. We included infants in
the review even if accurate VA measurement was not possible because of age. We recorded VA data as well as any information reported on visual fields (using the Goldman
perimeter or confrontation) and color vision (using Ishihara plates). Finally, we recorded further treatment details
and the indications for further treatment along with radiological response rates using revised Response Evaluation
Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST).20
VA data were categorized according to the recommendation by the International Council of Ophthalmology for
reporting vision loss in research.21 This recommendation
classifies visual impairment into normal vision (20/25),
mild impairment (20/32-20/63), moderate impairment
(20/80-20/160), severe impairment (20/200-20/400), profound impairment (20/500-20/1000), near blindness
(<20/1000), and blindness (no perception of light [NPL])
by VA scores. We also recorded the number of children
who were legally blind (best corrected VA <20/200 with
both eyes open).
As recommended by the Response Evaluation in
Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis Visual Outcomes Committee,22 VA was the primary outcome measure with fields, color vision, and optic disc pallor
recorded as additional information only.

Figure 1. Number of patients with tumors in different anatomic
locations. The locations bounded by the red lines are intraconal
(posterior boundary is the orbital apex), intracanalicular (posterior boundary is the optic foramen), intracranial-prechiasmatic,
chiasmatic, optic tract (posterior boundary is the lateral geniculate nucleus), and optic radiation. The topmost category represents chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the Student
2-tailed t test for unpaired data using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.
RESULTS
During this period, 43 patients underwent treatment for
OPG. VA and treatment details were available for 42
patients. The mean age of the patients was 4.6 years, 52%
were female, and NF-1 was present in 71%. Patient characteristics are reported in Table 1. Categorization of location is shown in Figure 1. Single-agent carboplatin was
the regimen used in 38 patients and 4 patients were
treated with carboplatin and vincristine. No patient
received radiotherapy as first-line treatment.
Visual decline was the most common reason for the
initiation of treatment, being at least a contributing factor
in 27 patients (64%). There were 2 deaths reported in the
study cohort, both among patients with chiasmatic/
hypothalamic gliomas, 1 of whom had NF-1. The mean
follow-up for the entire group was 78 months (range,
15-213 months).
4192

The study cohort contained 7 infants (those aged <2
years) and as such VA was not able to be quantified accurately before the initiation of therapy. Five of the infants
were known to, or later discovered to, have NF-1. Two
infants were believed to have normal vision at the time of
diagnosis and initiated treatment for diencephalic syndrome (1 infant) or because of concern about hypothalamic involvement (1 infant). Three infants had marked
unilateral optic atrophy and were later found to have profound visual loss or near blindness in that eye. Two infants
had nystagmus and bilateral disc pallor. Both had chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors and had significant bilateral
visual loss that was detected at a later date. The long-term
visual outcomes for these infants at a mean of 91 months
depended on tumor location. Those with unilateral
involvement achieved long-term stability of vision, albeit
with poor vision in the affected eye. Those infants with
chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors experienced ongoing
deterioration in vision and all required further treatment.
One infant died of disease and the remaining infants have
experienced at least severe bilateral visual loss (Table 2).
Normal VA

Of 35 patients (total of 70 eyes) who had VA testing performed at the time of diagnosis, 9 (26%) had bilaterally
normal VA before the initiation of therapy. Field defects
were the indication for treatment in 2 patients; 1 of these
patients improved and the second initiated treatment for
color vision impairment that was found to improve. Two
patients initiated treatment for diencephalic syndrome, 1
for proptosis, and the remaining 3 patients for radiologic
disease progression. All these patients retained normal VA

defects. After therapy, 5 patients were stable and 2 had
improved fields. In all patients, the posttherapy fields
were sustained at long-term follow-up.

Impact of Chemotherapy on VA

Long-Term Follow-Up

Five of the 35 patients who had VA testing at the time of
diagnosis (14%) and 7 eyes (10%) demonstrated
improvement in VA category with chemotherapy. This
included 3 patients (9%) and 5 eyes (7%) that returned to
a normal VA category after chemotherapy. One patient
with a chiasmatic/hypothalamic glioma experienced
improvement in VA in 1 eye and deterioration in the
other during therapy. This patient experienced further
deterioration in vision requiring additional therapy 57
months after the start of initial therapy. The other 4
patients who achieved unequivocal improvement in vision
while receiving therapy required no further therapy.
Stability of VA category over the course of therapy
was achieved in 27 patients (77%) and 59 eyes (84%). Of
these patients, 7 patients (20%) and 9 eyes (13%) experienced deterioration of vision at a later date and 6 patients
required further treatment at a later date. The majority of
patients with late visual deterioration had chiasmatic/
hypothalamic tumors.
Deterioration of VA category while receiving therapy was rare, occurring in 3 patients (9%) and 4 eyes
(6%). All patients among whom VA deteriorated during
therapy experienced further deterioration in vision at later
follow-up and 2 of these 3 patients were legally blind.
Details are summarized in Table 3.
At the time of diagnosis, 3 patients had reported
major color vision abnormalities. After therapy, 1
patient’s color vision was unchanged and in 2 patients it
had improved to normal. In all patients, the posttherapy
color vision outcome was sustained at long-term follow-

Overall, 13 eyes (19%) from 9 patients (26%) experienced deterioration in their VA category between diagnosis and the time of last follow-up. Seven of these patients
had further therapy. The 2 patients who did not receive
further therapy experienced only mild deterioration in
vision with limited functional implication. Three patients
(3 eyes) with deterioration in vision had intraconal
gliomas and underwent surgical excision of the glioma
and optic nerve for progressive proptosis, the result of
which was a reduction in vision to NLP in the affected
eye. The remaining 6 patients had gliomas involving the
chiasm. The percentage of patients with visual loss who
had NF-1 was approximately equivalent to the percentage
in the cohort as a whole.
Twenty patients (48%) required further treatment
after the first course of chemotherapy. Five patients had
further treatment initiated for deterioration in VA, 2 had
field changes prompting therapy, and the remainder initiated treatment for radiologic disease progression. No
patient had improved VA after subsequent therapy. Three
patients received radiotherapy.
Radiological response to chemotherapy as measured
on MRI scan was reasonably uniform. A total of 37
patients (88%) had radiologically stable disease at the end
of therapy. One patient achieved a partial response and
had an improvement in vision from moderate to mild
impairment in 1 eye. Four patients developed progressive
disease while receiving therapy, 3 of whom experienced
deterioration in vision at the time of last follow-up
compared with the initiation of therapy.

Vision was maintained in the same VA category between the end of treatment and last follow-up.

Long-term follow-up of VA with a mean follow-up
of 78 months is summarized in Table 4. Eleven patients
(26%) had normal VA bilaterally and 2 patients (5%) had
died. Using World Health Organization criteria, 7
patients (17%) had low vision (20/80-20/400) and 4
patients (10%) were blind or near blind (20/500 to NPL).
Eleven patients (26%) were legally blind by US and
Australian definitions (<20/200 best correct VA with
both eyes open). Those diagnosed in infancy or with
chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors were overrepresented in
the legally blind group (Table 2). The numbers were
small, making statistical analysis difficult. There was a
statistically significant difference in the percentage of
children who were legally blind between those with chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors (10 of 22 patients; 45%) and
those with tumors in other locations (1 of 20 patients;
5%) (corrected P<.01). Other differences did not achieve
statistical significance.
Twelve patients were identified from the database
who were found to have an OPG on MRI but no treatment was given. All these patients had NF-1. Long-term
VA data were available for 10 patients and 20 eyes. Nine
patients and 19 eyes retained completely normal vision at
a mean of 103 months, and 1 eye had long-standing,
stable, mild visual impairment.
DISCUSSION
The majority of patients with OPG who require treatment
have visual outcomes that are stable when compared with
the visual outcome at the initiation of treatment. The minority of patients who experience improved vision during
therapy have a high probability of retaining these gains in
the long term. There are 3 groups with a more guarded
visual prognosis.

The first of these groups is infants. There are most
likely 2 factors contributing to this. It has been shown that
younger age contributes a worse prognosis in terms of
progression-free survival and overall survival for all pediatric patients with low-grade gliomas.3 It may be that the
biology of tumors in this age group drives more aggressive
behavior and that there is a relatively longer period until
the expected senescence of the tumor in young adulthood.
The other possible reason for poorer visual outcomes
among infants is delayed diagnosis. Visual impairment is
difficult to detect in preverbal children and in cases in
which suspicion does arise, assessments are difficult.
Given the limited ability of chemotherapy to improve
vision for most children, the majority of children with a
severe visual impairment at the time of diagnosis will
usually continue to have poor vision in the long term.
The second group with a guarded visual prognosis is
those who have chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors. This
was the most common location of OPGs in the current series with 22 cases (52%). Children with tumors in this
location are known to have a poorer outcome in terms of
progression-free and overall survival.3 Approximately
32% of children in the current study cohort with tumors
at this anatomic site experienced a long-term deterioration
in vision and 45% were legally blind at the time of last
follow-up. The obvious additional factor in this group is
that visual impairment is often bilateral, thereby leading
to greater issues related to quality of life compared with
children who retain normal vision in one eye.12 Given
Cancer

December 1, 2015

Visual Outcome for OPG/Dodgshun et al

that this group are at higher risk of long-term visual
impairment in addition to radiologic disease progression
and mortality, better treatments are urgently needed for
patients with tumors at this site. Bevicizumab-based
chemotherapy regimens have demonstrated promise for
improving visual outcome in patients with chiasmatic/
hypothalamic tumors.23-25 This is particularly important
given the frequency of this form of OPG.
The third group of patients who experienced visual
deterioration were those with significant intraconal
tumors. Although there were 9 patients in the cohort who
had some gliomatous involvement of the intraconal optic
nerve, 4 had tumors that were confined to the intraconal
optic nerve and all tumors were large at the time of diagnosis. This compares with the other 5 children in the current study who had more diffuse involvement of the optic
nerve in which the enlargement of the nerve was much less
marked. Of these patients with significant and isolated
intraconal involvement, 3 required surgery to debulk
these tumors, rendering that eye blind. In each case, there
was already at least profound visual impairment in this
eye before the surgery took place, meaning that the loss of
overall visual functional due to the surgery was limited.
The 13 children in the current study without any of
these risk factors (31%) achieved long-term visual stability
over 90% of the time (defined as a VA category at the
time of last follow-up that was better than or equal to the
pretreatment category) and only 1 child was legally blind
at the time of late follow-up.
Gains made in VA, or indeed color vision or fields,
are largely sustained in the long term, which may again
reflect tumor biology. If chemotherapy induced tumor
retreat or relieved pressure on the optic pathway during
treatment, even if this reduction was not detected on
radiological measurement, this may reflect biology that
confers a relatively benign behavior.
OPGs are common in children with NF-1. Many
tumors most likely remain undetected and asymptomatic
into adulthood. The current review focused on those
patients who required therapy for their tumors. Although
we briefly reported on 12 patients who had known OPGs
and did not receive therapy, there are undoubtedly many
other patients who have tumors that either were not
detected or not managed by our service. Practice has
changed over time regarding the use of routine MRI scans
in patients with NF-1. Provided patients are receiving
regular ophthalmology surveillance, it is a reasonable
assumption that should a patient experience a reduction
in vision, appropriate action would be taken leading to a
referral to an oncology service. In the current study, it was
Cancer

December 1, 2015

demonstrated that in patients who were referred to our
service with normal vision and stable tumors, vision
remained largely normal to a mean of 103 months without therapy.
Radiological response was found to be a poor predictor of visual outcome. Improvement in vision was possible
with stable disease as was deterioration of vision. The one
patient who achieved a partial radiological response did
experience an improvement in vision. Progressive disease
while receiving therapy was associated with long-term
deterioration of vision and this likely reflects aggressive biological tumor behavior. Criteria other than tumor size
may be more appropriate to determine the radiological
response of these tumors such as alteration in enhancement, alteration in diffusion restriction, or functional
measures such as positron emission tomography/MRI.
Limitations of the current study lie mainly in its retrospective nature. There was no prospective protocol
under which patients were treated and therapy was initiated based on the discretion of the treating clinician. Despite the lack of the formal rigor of a clinical trial, we
believe the current study nevertheless reflects the reality of
clinical practice for the majority of patients treated for this
indication. We believe that there is minimal impact of
bias on the current study sample because ophthalmological assessments were available for all but one patient
treated at the study institution. As mentioned, the results
of the current study pertain only to the group studied (ie,
patients who present to pediatric oncology services for the
treatment of OPG).
Visual assessment was assessed almost exclusively
using VA. Although this is in keeping with recommendations by the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis
and Schwannomatosis Visual Outcomes Committee,22
other measures such as visual fields and contrast sensitivity
may play a role in determining quality of life. Accurately
determining visual fields is notoriously difficult in children aged <10 years and it is uncommon to have isolated
field loss without acuity loss in this setting.12 In cases in
which visual fields or other assessments were recorded in
the clinical notes, they were included in this analysis but
the incomplete and unreliable nature of these assessments
means that strong conclusions were unable to be drawn.
Conclusions

Overall visual outcome was relatively poor. Approximately one-quarter of the current study cohort was legally
blind at the time of last follow-up. This figure is not applicable to patients with OPGs as a whole, only those with
tumors that require treatment.

Original Article

Consistent with previous reports, visual stability is
the most common outcome after chemotherapy (77% in
the current series). Therefore, establishing the pace and
trajectory of visual impairment is essential before the initiation of chemotherapy. If visual loss is discovered but is
not progressive, initiating chemotherapy with a likely outcome of stability makes little sense in cases in which this
may have been the natural history without treatment.
Improvement in vision while receiving chemotherapy is
relatively uncommon (14% in the current series), but
when improvement occurs it is very likely to be retained.
Deterioration of vision while receiving treatment is also
uncommon (9% in the current series) but when this does
occur, a further decline in vision is highly likely and led to
legal blindness in 2 of our 3 patients in this setting.
For OPGs diagnosed in all locations other than
intraconal or chiasmatic/hypothalamic sites, visual outcome at the end of first treatment appears to be strongly
predictive of long-term visual outcome.
