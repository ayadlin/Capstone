Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of estrogens in
Leydig cell tumor proliferation. We used R2C rat Leydig tumor
cells and testicular samples from Fischer rats with a developed
Leydig tumor. Both experimental models express high levels
of aromatase and estrogen receptor A (ERA). Treatment with
exogenous 17B-estradiol (E2) induced proliferation of R2C
cells and up-regulation of cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and
cyclin E, the expression of which was blocked by addition of
antiestrogens. These observations led us to hypothesize an
E2/ERA–dependent mechanism for Leydig cell tumor proliferation. In determining the molecular mechanism responsible
for aromatase overexpression, we found that total and phosphorylated levels of transcription factors cyclic AMP–responsive
element binding protein and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1)
were higher in tumor samples. Moreover, we found that tumor
Leydig cells produce high levels of insulin-like growth factor I
(IGF-I), which increased aromatase mRNA, protein, and
activity as a consequence of increased total and phosphorylated SF-1 levels. Specific inhibitors of IGF-I receptor, protein
kinase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase determined a
reduction in SF-1 expression and in IGF-I–dependent SF-1
recruitment to the aromatase PII promoter. The same
inhibitors also inhibited aromatase expression and activity
and, consequently, R2C cell proliferation. We can conclude
that one of the molecular mechanisms determining Leydig cell
tumorigenesis is an excessive estrogen production that stimulates a short autocrine loop determining cell proliferation.
In addition, cell-produced IGF-I amplifies estrogen signaling
through an SF-1–dependent up-regulation of aromatase
expression. The identification of this molecular mechanism
will be helpful in defining new therapeutic approaches for
Leydig cell tumors. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8368–77]

Introduction
The etiology and pathogenesis of human testicular tumors are
poorly defined. It has been reported that serum estrogen levels
are elevated in patients with testicular germ cell cancer as a
consequence of increased local estrogen production reflecting
higher aromatase activity present in Sertoli and Leydig cells (1).

Ninety-five percent of all human testicular neoplasms arise from
germinal cells whereas Leydig cell tumors are the most common
tumors of the gonadal stroma (2).
In rodents, reproductive system tumors are uncommon in
general, with the few exceptions of Leydig cell and ventral prostatic
neoplasms in some rat strains (3) or non-inbred mice (4); however,
analogously to the human (5), chronic administration of estrogens
induces testicular tumors.
A useful model used to investigate whether excess estrogens
might have a central role in the mechanism leading to testicular
tumorigenesis are transgenic mice overexpressing aromatase and
presenting enhancement of circulating 17h-estradiol (E2) levels (6).
About half of the male mice are infertile and/or have enlarged testis
and show Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumors (6),
whereas the female mice reveal mammary gland hyperplasia
associated with an altered expression pattern of proteins involved
in apoptosis, cell cycle, growth, and tumor suppression (7).
Whereas the effects of estrogen on mammary gland tumorigenesis
in human and rodents are well known, the role of aromatase
overexpression and in situ estrogen production in testicular
tumorigenesis has not been clearly defined. In this study, we have
investigated the molecular mechanisms causing aromatase overexpression and the effect of estradiol (E2) overproduction on rat
Leydig cell tumor proliferation. As an experimental model, we
used the R2C rat Leydig tumor cell line; to validate our in vitro data
in an in vivo model, we used Leydig cell tumors from older Fisher
rats characterized by an exceptionally high incidence of spontaneous neoplasm with aging (8).
Aromatase activity is regulated primarily at the level of gene
expression and is present in testicular somatic cells and along the
maturative phases of male germ cells (9, 10). The CYP19 gene that
encodes aromatase has at least eight unique promoters that are
used in a tissue-specific manner (11). The proximal promoter II
regulates aromatase expression in human fetal and adult testis,
R2C and H540 rat Leydig tumor cells, and purified preparations
of rat Leydig, Sertoli, and germ cells (12, 13). Specific sequences
seem to be mainly involved in aromatase expression: a sequence
that contains a half-site binding nuclear receptors (AGGTCA) in
position 90 in the rat binding steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1; ref. 14)
and cyclic AMP (cAMP)–responsive element (CRE)–like sequences
binding cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor protein family members (15, 16) localized
upstream at a more distal position, in the rat in positions 169
(TGCACGTCA), 335 (TGAACTCA), and 231 (TGAAATCA; ref. 17).
Similar responsive elements (binding CRE and SF-1) have been
reported for the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein gene
promoter (18) whose expression is regulated by insulin-like growth
factor-I (IGF-I) signaling in Leydig cells. Because the StAR protein is
involved in the transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner

Role of Estrogen and IGF-I in Leydig Cell Tumorogenesis

mitochondrial membrane, the rate-limiting and regulated step in
steroidogenesis IGF-I plays an important role in the regulation of
testicular steroid biosynthesis.
For these reasons, we investigated the role of IGF-I, a peptide
also shown to have a role in testicular growth and development
and in the control of Leydig cell number (19). IGF-I is produced
locally in the testis, in Sertoli, Leydig, and peritubular cells derived
from the immature rat testis and cultured in vitro (20, 21). The
crucial role of IGF-I in the development and function of Leydig
cells was highlighted by studies on IGF-I gene knockout mice
(22, 23). The failure of adult Leydig cells to mature and the
reduced capacity for testosterone production are caused by
deregulated expression of testosterone biosynthetic and metabolizing enzymes (24). Expression levels of all mRNA species
associated with testosterone biosynthesis are lower in the absence
of IGF-I. However, this study did not investigate the effect of
IGF-I on aromatase expression, although an effect could be
supposed.
Starting from these findings, in this study we investigated
whether a testicular overproduction of IGF-I could be one of the
mechanisms determining aromatase overexpression in rat tumor
Leydig cells through the activation of specific transcription factors.
The elevated aromatase-dependent E2 production in Leydig
cells, through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism mediated by
their own receptors, could contribute to the hormone dependence
of testicular tumorigenesis by stimulating Leydig tumor cell
proliferation.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and animals. TM3 cells (immature mouse Leydig cell line)
were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (HS),
2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotics (Invitrogen S.R.L.); R2C cells
(rat Leydig tumor cell line) were cultured in Ham/F-10 supplemented with
15% HS, 2.5% FBS, and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Male Fischer 344 rats
(a generous gift of Sigma-Tau), 6 (FRN) and 24 (FRT) months of age, were
used for studies. Twenty-four-month-old animals presented spontaneously
developed Leydig cell tumors, which were absent in younger animals. Testes
of all animals were surgically removed by qualified, specialized animal care
staff in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(NIH) and used for experiments.
Aromatase activity assay. The aromatase activity in subconfluent R2C
cell culture medium was measured by tritiated water-release assay using
0.5 Amol/L [1h-3H(N)]androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (DuPont NEN) as a substrate (25). Incubations were done at 37jC for 2 h under a 95%:5% air/CO2
atmosphere. Obtained results were expressed as picomoles per hour (pmol/h)
and normalized to milligrams of protein (pmol/h/mg protein).
RIA. Before the experiments, TM3 cells were maintained overnight in
DMEM/F-12 and R2C cells in Ham/F-10 (medium only). The estradiol
content of medium recovered from each well was determined against
standards prepared in low-serum medium using a RIA kit (DSL 43100;
Diagnostic System Laboratories). Results of the assay were normalized to
the cellular protein content per well and expressed as picomoles per
milligram of cell protein.
To measure IGF-I concentration in testicular extracts, testes were
weighed, homogenated in 500 AL of 0.05 mol/L Tris/HCl (pH 7.6) plus
protease inhibitors, and then submitted to ultrasonication followed by
centrifugation, as previously published (26). IGF-I content in testicular
extracts and in medium recovered from each well of R2C and TM3 cells was
determined following extraction and assay protocols provided with the
mouse/rat IGF-I RIA kit (DSL 2900; Diagnostic System Laboratories).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. This assay was done using the
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit from Upstate with minor
modifications in the protocol. R2C cells were grown in 100-mm plates.

Confluent cultures (90%) were treated for 24 h with AG1024 (Sigma),
PD98059 (Calbiochem, VWR International S.R.L.), LY294002 (Calbiochem,
VWR International), GF109203X (Calbiochem, VWR International), or for
increasing times with 100 ng/mL IGF-I (Sigma), or left untreated.
Following treatment, DNA/protein complexes were cross-linked with 1%
formaldehyde at 37jC for 10 min. Next, cells were collected and
resuspended in 400 AL of SDS lysis buffer (Upstate Technology) and left
on ice for 10 min. Then, cells were sonicated four times for 10 s at 30% of
maximal power and collected by centrifugation at 4jC for 10 min at
14,000 rpm. Ten microliters of the supernatants were kept as input
(starting material, to normalize results) whereas 100 AL were diluted 1:10
in 900 AL of chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (Upstate
Technology) and immunocleared with 80 AL of sonicated salmon sperm
DNA/protein A agarose (Upstate) for 6 h at 4jC. Immunocomplex was
formed using 1 AL of 1:5 dilution of specific anti–SF-1 antibody (provided
by Prof. Ken-ichirou Morohashi, Division for Sex Differentiation, National
Institute for Basic Biology, National Institutes of Natural Sciences,
Myodaiji-cho, Okazaki, Japan) overnight at 4jC. Immunoprecipitation
with salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose was continued at 4jC until
the following day. DNA/protein complexes were reverse cross-linked
overnight at 65jC. Extracted DNA was resuspended in 20 AL of Tris-EDTA
buffer. A 3-AL volume of each sample and input was used for PCR using
CYP19 promoter II–specific primers. The PCR conditions were 1 min at
94jC, 1 min at 50jC, and 2 min at 72jC for 30 cycles using the following
primers: forward, 5¶-TCAAGGGTAGGAATTGGGAC-3¶; reverse, 5¶-GGTGCTGGAATGGACAGATG-3¶. Amplification products were analyzed on a 1%
agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In control
samples, nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulin G was used instead of
specific antibodies.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Before the experiments, cells
were maintained overnight in low-serum medium. Cells were then treated
for the indicated times and RNA was extracted from cells using the TRizol
RNA isolation system (Invitrogen). TRizol was also used to homogenize
total tissue of normal (FRNT) and tumor (FRTT) Fisher rat testes for RNA
extraction. Each RNA sample was treated with DNase I (Ambion), and
purity and integrity of the RNA were confirmed spectroscopically and by
gel electrophoresis before use. One microgram of total RNA was reverse
transcribed in a final volume of 30 AL using the ImProm-II Reverse
transcription system kit (Promega, Promega Italia S.R.L.); cDNA was
diluted 1:3 in nuclease-free water, aliquoted, and stored at 20jC. Primers
for the amplification were based on published sequences for the rat
CYP19, rat CREB, and rat SF-1 genes. The nucleotide sequences of the
primers for CYP19 were forward, 5¶-GAGAAACTGGAAGACTGTATGGAT3¶, and reverse, 5¶-ACTGATTCACGTTCTCCTTTGTCA-3¶. For CREB amplification, we used the following primers: forward, 5¶-AATATGCACAGACCACTGATGGA-3¶, and reverse, 5¶-TGCTGTGCGAATCTGGTATGTT-3¶; for
SF-1 amplification, primers have been previously published (27). PCR
reactions were done in the iCycler iQ Detection System (Bio-Rad) using 0.1
Amol/L of each primer, in a total volume of 30-AL reaction mixture
following the manufacturer’s recommendations. SYBR Green Universal
PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) with the dissociation protocol was used for
gene amplification; negative controls contained water instead of firststrand cDNA. Each sample was normalized on the basis of its 18S rRNA
content. The 18S quantification was done using a TaqMan rRNA Reagent
kit (Applied Biosystems) following the method provided in the TaqMan
rRNA Control Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). The relative gene
expression levels were normalized to a calibrator that was chosen to be
the basal, untreated sample. Final results were expressed as n-fold
differences in gene expression relative to 18S rRNA and calibrator,
calculated using the DDC t method as follows:
n  fold ¼ 2ðDCtsample DCtcalibrator Þ
where DC t values of the sample and calibrator were determined by
subtracting the average C t value of the 18S rRNA reference gene from the
average C t value of the different genes analyzed.

experiments were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Student-NewmanKeuls multiple comparison methods, using SigmaStat version 3.0 (SPSS).

Results
Estradiol induces Leydig cell tumor proliferation through
an autocrine mechanism. We carried out our study using R2C
Leydig tumor cells as model system. These cells have been shown
to have high aromatase expression and activity (14). We also used
another Leydig cell line, TM3, as a normal control and analyzed
testes from older and younger Fischer rats. Aged animals have a

high incidence of spontaneous Leydig cell neoplasm (8, 28), a
phenomenon not observed in younger animals, allowing us to
use them as a good in vivo model to confirm results obtained in
cell lines. Our first step was to measure estradiol content in culture
media of R2C and TM3 cells. Whereas E2 levels in TM3 medium
were extremely low (data not shown) in R2C cells, E2 levels after
24 h were 0.5 pmol/mg protein and increased by 7-fold at 96 h
(Fig. 1A). This production was dependent on high constitutive
active aromatase activity because the presence of the aromatase
inhibitor letrozole was able to decrease E2 production at all doses
and times tested (Fig. 1A). E2 levels after 24-h treatment with
letrozole were still detectable but were completely knocked down
when we removed the medium after 24 h and renewed the
treatment for an additional 24 h. The same effect was maintained
at the other two time points investigated (Fig. 1A). Once estradiol is
produced, it can exert its actions by binding to specific receptors,
the estrogen receptors a and h (ERa and ERh). Analysis of the two
protein receptor isoforms in our models showed that tumor Leydig
cells express both isoforms of ER (Fig. 1B). Particularly, the a
isoform seems to be more expressed in R2C cells with respect to
TM3 and in FRTT with respect to its control FRNT (Fig. 1B)
in which ERh, instead, is more expressed (Fig. 1B). In R2C as well
as in FRTT, an increase in the ERa/ERh ratio was observed
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, aromatase protein content is
extremely high in tumor samples (Fig. 1B).
Our next experiments showed that ERs are required for
proliferation through a short autocrine loop maintained by
endogenous E2 production in Leydig tumor cells. For instance,
the use of both antiestrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 182780
and the use of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole determined a
dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 1C). Among
the different doses tested, the highest dose of 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(10 Amol/L) was able to inhibit cell proliferation by 90%; 10 Amol/L
ICI 182780, by 86%; and 10 Amol/L letrozole, by 70%. Moreover,

after starving cells for a prolonged time and changing the medium
everyday to remove local E2 production, we found that addition
of 1, 10, and 100 nmol/L E2 stimulated Leydig tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 1C), overcoming the inhibition induced by letrozole
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). The stimulatory effect of E2 was
concomitant with increased levels of cell cycle regulators cyclin
D1 and cyclin E, whose expression was inhibited by the pure
antiestrogen ICI 182780 (Fig. 1D). All these results address how
the classic E2/ERa signaling may control Leydig cell tumor growth
and proliferation similarly to what was observed in other estrogendependent tumors.
Aromatase overexpression is determined by constitutive
activation of transcription factors SF-1 and CREB. Aromatase
gene transcription in rat Leydig cells is driven by the PII promoter,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

which is mainly regulated through three CRE-like sites and one
NRE site binding SF-1 and LRH-1 (14, 27). Constitutively active
levels of CREB have previously been shown in R2C cells (29). Here,
we confirmed these data and showed that FRTT have a high
phosphorylated CREB status (Fig. 2), together with enhanced
expression and phosphorylation of SF-1, with respect to FRNT
(Fig. 2). Furthermore, we showed the presence of high expression
levels of SF-1 with the phosporylated protein present in R2C but
not in TM3 cells (Fig. 2).
IGF-I is produced by R2C cells and induces aromatase
expression through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase– and protein
kinase C–mediated activation of SF-1. Starting from previous
findings showing the ability of IGF-I to activate SF-1 and CREB,
which leads to an increase in StAR transcription and then

Role of Estrogen and IGF-I in Leydig Cell Tumorogenesis

steroidogenesis (18), we investigated the role of this factor in
regulating aromatase. Determination of IGF-I content in TM3 and
R2C culture medium by RIA revealed a significant difference in
growth factor production, with R2C cells producing f4-fold higher
IGF-I amounts (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we measured IGF-I content in
testicular tissues, revealing a significant difference between FRTT
and FRNT (Fig. 3B). IGF-I exerts its actions by binding to specific
receptors (IGF-IR); however, we did not reveal differences in IGF-IR
expression between TM3 and R2C cells (Fig. 3C).
On binding to IGF-IR, IGF-I activates three major transductional
pathways: Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and phospholipase C
(PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC). To show the involvement of IGF-I
transductional pathways in modulating aromatase expression in
Leydig cell tumors, we used specific inhibitors of IGF-IR (AG1024),
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 (PD98059), PI3K
(LY294002), and PKC (GF109203X). The IGF-IR inhibitor was able
to inhibit aromatase activity by 85%; LY294002 determined 65%
inhibition; PD98059, 35%; and GF109203X, 61% (Fig. 3D). A similar
inhibitory pattern, except for PD98059, was observed also on

aromatase mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and protein content
(Fig. 4A–D). All of the different inhibitors, excluding PD98059, were
able to reduce SF-1 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2B), whereas
CREB remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Analysis
of protein levels by Western blot confirmed the data from mRNA
(Fig. 4A–D ). Treatments with increasing doses of AG1024,
LY294002, and GF109203X, but not PD98059, were able to induce
a dose-dependent inhibition of total and phosphorylated levels of
SF-1 without affecting CREB (Fig. 4A–D).
Addition of exogenous amounts of IGF-I was able to induce a
significant increase of 2- and 3.8-fold in aromatase mRNA at 12
and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 5A). Aromatase protein levels under
the same treatments reflected the mRNA data (Fig. 5B). Analysis
of expression levels of total and phosphorylated forms of
transcription factors SF-1 and CREB showed an increase in SF-1
and pSF-1 in the presence of IGF-I starting at 4 h, whereas no
differences were observed for CREB at any of the investigated
times (Fig. 5B). AG1024, LY294002, and GF109203X were able to
inhibit IGF-I effects on CYP19 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5C
and D) as a consequence of a decreased SF-1 expression (Fig. 5D).

We also carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to
investigate how IGF-I influences binding of transcription factors
to the aromatase PII promoter. The increase in SF-1 protein
content that was seen under IGF-I treatment reflected an increase
in SF-1 binding to the PII promoter (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Moreover, we evidenced how in basal conditions (Supplementary
Fig. S3B), as well as after IGF-I treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S3C), all the different inhibitors, but not PD98059, reduced
SF-1 binding.
IGF-I–induced estradiol production modulates R2C cell
proliferation. Treatment with IGF-I induces aromatase activity
and estradiol production, which are decreased by AG1024,
LY294002, and GF109203X, as well as by PD98059 (Fig. 6A and
B). The observed changes in estradiol production modified R2C
cell proliferative behavior (Fig. 6C). In addition, the use of an
anti–IGF-I antibody in immunoneutralization experiments caused
a dose-dependent inhibition in tritiated thymidine incorporation
(Fig. 6C). The ability of IGF-I to stimulate, and that of the
inhibitors to block, cell proliferation was linked to an alteration in
cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The current study aimed to explain the molecular mechanism
responsible for aromatase overexpression in tumor Leydig cells
leading to a consequent excess of in situ estradiol production that
sustains tumor cell growth and proliferation.
The mammalian testis is capable of estrogen synthesis, which is
regulated by different factors at different ages. In mature animals,
aromatization of testosterone to estradiol is enhanced by luteinizing hormone (LH)/chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and not by
follicle-stimulating hormone. The site of this synthesis seems to be
age dependent, at least in some species such as the rat (30). Leydig
cells are an elective target site of LH/CG that controls testosterone
biosynthesis as well as its conversion to estradiol through
aromatase activity. Alterations in local estrogen synthesis may
have significant consequences in malignancy of these cells. In the
present study, we observed that R2C cells release a conspicuous
amount of E2 from cellular storage in a time-dependent manner.
In this condition, E2 production (1,300 F 230 pg/106 cells/24 h) is
significantly higher compared with E2 levels produced by TM3
cells and by primary rat Leydig cell cultures (246 pg/106

Role of Estrogen and IGF-I in Leydig Cell Tumorogenesis

3h-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase–positive cells/24 h; ref. 31). E2
synthesis by R2C cells was abrogated by treatment with letrozole,
addressing how steroid production is dependent on high
constitutive aromatase activity. A strong increase in aromatase
expression was observed in R2C cells compared with the normal
cell line TM3 control, as well as in FRTT compared with FRNT.
These findings agree with a previous study on human tissues
showing that the increase in estrogen synthesis, as a consequence
of a more intense aromatase activity, is higher in the Leydig cell
tumor fraction than in normal tissues surrounding the tumor of
the same patient (32).
Mediators of the physiologic effects of estrogens are ERa and
ERh. An enhanced expression of ERa, resulting in an increased
ERa/ERh ratio, was observed in R2C compared with TM3 cell line,
as well as in FRTT compared with FRNT. This is in agreement
with previous reports showing that transgenic mice overexpressing aromatase have an enhanced occurrence of breast and Leydig
cell tumors together with an enhanced expression of ERa in the
tumor tissue (6). The latter findings reasonably address how a
short estrogen autocrine loop may be involved in breast and
testicular tumorigenesis in the presence of an excess of locally
produced estradiol. Indeed, an arrest of cell growth was observed
following abrogation of local E2 production with letrozole or
after addition of ERa inhibitors ICI 182780 or 4-hydroxytamoxifen.
Besides, only after changing the medium everyday along with
prolonged R2C starvation, abolishing local steroid production, did
we observe how exogenous E2 was able to display proliferative
effects.
One mechanism through which estrogens induce cell proliferation is by increasing protein levels of G1 regulatory cyclins A, B1,
D1, D3, and E in target cells (33). In our study, we showed that the
expression of two of the most important regulators of Leydig cell
cycle, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, can be increased by E2 and downregulated by treatment with antiestrogens. These data further
confirm that aromatase overexpression and the consequent E2
production may be the cause of altered cell cycle regulation of
Leydig tumor cells.
In an attempt to explain the molecular mechanism determining
aromatase overexpression in our tumor cell line, we focused our
attention on the expression levels of transcription factors identified
as crucial regulators of aromatase gene expression, CREB and SF-1.
In the adult testis, SF-1 is predominantly expressed in Leydig cells
(34). The increase of total and/or phosphorylated protein can
potentiate SF-1 transcriptional activity (35). In R2C cells and in
FRTT, compared with the normal controls, we found higher
phosphorylated SF-1 protein levels as a consequence of elevated
protein content. Total CREB levels were similar in all samples but
highly phosphorylated in tumor samples. Starting from these
observations, we investigated which pathways might be involved in
the activation of these transcription factors.
The most important signal regulating Leydig cell function is the
binding of LH to the LH receptor (LHR; ref. 36). Several
observations indicate that constitutively active mutants of LHRs
could be involved in Leydig cell transformation (37). It has been
shown that the LH/LHR signaling pathway is constitutively active
in the R2C tumor Leydig cell line and makes the phenotype of
these cells constitutively steroidogenic (38). For instance, in the
presence of a specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, constitutive
syntheses of Star mRNA and steroids were significantly inhibited
(39). These observations fit well with our findings indicating how
the presence of PKA inhibitor determined a strong decrease in

www.aacrjournals.org

aromatase activity, together with a drop in CREB phosphorylation
(data not shown). Here, we show that the presence of a specific
PKC inhibitor had no effects on CREB phosphorylation while SF-1
dropped dramatically.
It has been shown that CREB in mouse Leydig cells can be
phosphorylated also through the PKC pathway activated by IGF-I
(38). In this work, we have revealed that R2C tumor Leydig cells
release higher levels of IGF-I in the culture medium with respect to
TM3 cells, and the concentration of IGF-I in FRTT is increased with
respect to FRNT. However, the exposure to IGF-I as well as to
the treatment with inhibitors of IGF-I signaling did not affect the
CREB phosphorylative status but decreased SF-1 phosphorylation,
postulating separate mechanisms that control CREB and SF-1
activation in modulating aromatase activity.
It has been suggested that IGF-I can influence Leydig cell
survival and proliferation (40, 41). Moreover, it has been shown
that IGF-I up-regulates aromatase expression in primary cultures
of rat Leydig cells through a cAMP-independent mechanism (42).
Our findings led us to suppose that the elevated IGF-I levels
derived from tumor Leydig cells in vivo and in vitro contribute to
enhance aromatase expression through an autocrine mechanism
activating SF-1. The important role played by IGF-I in Leydig cell
tumorigenesis is further supported by the substantially unchanged
IGF-IR expression level between TM3 and R2C cells. Binding of
IGF-I to its receptor causes receptor autophosphorylation and the
activation of an intrinsic tyrosine kinase that acts on various
substrates, leading to activation of multiple signaling pathways
including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK cascades. In addition, it has
been shown that IGF-I can activate the PLC/PKC pathway (18).
We treated R2C cells with specific inhibitors of IGF-I signaling
(AG1024), ERK1/2 (PD98059), PI3K (LY294002), and PKC
(GF109203X) in the presence or absence of IGF-I and revealed
that addition of IGF-I itself was able to increase aromatase
expression, activity, and estradiol production, whereas all the
inhibitors determined a reduction of enzyme activity and estradiol
release.
For instance, the inhibition of IGF-I signaling through inhibition
of either the PI3K/AKT or PLC/PKC pathway was able to block SF-1
expression and protein phosphorylation. In particular, treatment
with AG1024 blocked SF-1 phosphorylation more efficiently than
the separate treatment with PI3K or PKC alone, addressing how
both pathways may synergize in up-regulating SF-1 activity. In the
presence of PD98059, SF-1 expression remained unchanged as did
aromatase mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, aromatase
activity and estradiol production seemed to be decreased in the
presence of PD98059, suggesting a potential stimulatory role of
ERK1/2 on the enzyme at a posttranscriptional level. Furthermore,
we observed that SF-1 binding to the aromatase promoter II is
enhanced by IGF-I and reduced by AG1024, LY294002, and
GF109203X, but not by PD98059, indicating the central role of this
transcription factor in regulating aromatase gene transcription in
tumor Leydig cells. This is the first report of a direct link between
SF-1 transcription and the IGF-I signaling pathway in regulating
aromatase expression.
The observed changes in estradiol production due to IGF-I
determined an effect on R2C cell proliferative behavior. In fact,
inhibitors of IGF-I signaling or the use of an anti–IGF-I antibody in
immunoneutralization experiments blocked thymidine incorporation. Moreover, IGF-I up-regulates cyclins D1 and E whereas IGF-I
signaling inhibitors decrease the same factors, analogously to the
antiestrogen ICI 182780.

From our findings emerges a double mechanism inducing
enhanced expression of aromatase: (a) constitutive activation of
the LH/cAMP/PKA pathway, which determines CREB activation;
(b) enhanced IGF-I signaling potentiating SF-1 action. The
enhanced activity of SF-1 in inducing aromatase expression may
be maintained by the lack of DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal,
adrenal hypoplasia congenita, critical region on the X chromosome,
gene 1) expression in R2C cells (29). DAX-1 is a specific corepressor
of SF-1 (43, 44) and inhibits StAR expression and steroidogenesis by
40% to 60% when overexpressed in R2C cells (29). The lack of
DAX-1 expression in R2C cells may be due to constitutively active
PKA signaling because in a mouse Leydig cell line, a marked
decrease of DAX-1 mRNA occurred within 3 h after addition of
LH and forskolin (45). Then, the activation of LH/LHR/PKA
pathway at the same time decreases DAX-1 expression and
promotes SF-1 activity. A further demonstration of the role of
DAX-1 in regulating P450 aromatase expression comes from the
observations that in TM3 cells, IGF-I induces SF-1 expression but is
unable to induce aromatase expression because DAX-1 is highly
expressed (data not shown). Finally, the finding that in DAX-1
knockout mice aromatase is overexpressed selectively in Leydig
cells (46) underscores the importance of this type of transcription
factor in local testicular estrogen production in vivo.
It remains to be explained which molecular mechanism(s) is
responsible for the elevated IGF-I production in Leydig tumor cells.
In vivo, the administration of human CG increases IGF-I mRNA
levels in rat Leydig cells (47). LH deprival determines a decrease in
bromodeoxyuridine incorporation as well as a decrease in IGF-I
and IGF-IR mRNA levels (48). These observations suggest the
possibility that LH can mediate its proliferative effects also by
regulating IGF-I and its receptor in Leydig cells and that the altered
LH/LHR–activated pathway in R2C cells could be the cause of IGFI overproduction. Moreover, the observation that in murine Leydig
cells IGF-I is able to increase LHR mRNA stability (49), together
with data showing that the presence of an anti–IGF-I antibody

reduces the steroidogenic responsiveness to LH/human CG (50),
also suggests the possibility of IGF-I action in sustaining LH/LHR
signaling. Aromatase overexpression seems to be induced by the
combined enhancement of LH/LHR and IGF-I signaling. Particularly, LH/LHR signaling determines a constitutive active CREB
phosphorylation on aromatase gene promoter whereas IGF-I
overproduction stimulates SF-1 binding on the same promoter
through an autocrine mechanism. In other words, from this study,
it emerges that the reproducibility of data between our in vivo and
in vitro models is linked to an enhanced PKA activity, together with
increased E2/ERa and IGF-I signaling.
In conclusion, in this study we showed that in Leydig tumor
cells, aromatase overexpression determines an excessive local
estradiol production that is able to stimulate the expression of
genes involved in cell cycle regulation sustaining cell proliferation.
Aromatase overexpression seems to be concomitant with an
enhanced IGF-I signaling in R2C cells as well as in our in vivo
model, supporting the hypothesis of a cooperation between
estrogen and IGF-I in Leydig cell tumorigenesis, which is also
observed in other tumor tissues. The observation that antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors as well as IGF-I signaling blockers
are able to reduce R2C proliferation is indicative of possible
applications of these drugs as new adjuvant therapeutic tools for
the treatment of testicular cancer.
