Abstract
ALT-803, a complex of an interleukin (IL)-15 superagonist mutant and a dimeric IL-15 receptor aSu/Fc
fusion protein, was found to exhibit signiﬁcantly stronger in vivo biologic activity on NK and T cells than IL15. In this study, we show that a single dose of ALT-803, but not IL-15 alone, eliminated well-established
5T33P and MOPC-315P myeloma cells in the bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice. ALT-803 treatment also
signiﬁcantly prolonged survival of myeloma-bearing mice and provided resistance to rechallenge with the
same tumor cells through a CD8þ T-cell–dependent mechanism. ALT-803 treatment stimulated CD8þ
T cells to secrete large amounts of IFN-g and promoted rapid expansion of CD8þCD44high memory T cells
in vivo. These memory CD8þ T cells exhibited ALT-803–mediated upregulation of NKG2D (KLRK1) but not
PD-1 (PDCD1) or CD25 (IL2RA) on their cell surfaces. ALT-803–activated CD8þ memory T cells also
exhibited nonspeciﬁc cytotoxicity against myeloma and other tumor cells in vitro, whereas IFN-g had no
direct effect on myeloma cell growth. ALT-803 lost its antimyeloma activity in tumor-bearing IFN-g
knockout mice but retained the ability to promote CD8þCD44high memory T-cell proliferation, indicating
that ALT-803–mediated stimulation of CD8þCD44high memory T cells is IFN-g–independent. Thus, besides
well-known IL-15 biologic functions in host immunity, this study shows that IL-15–based ALT-803 could
activate CD8þCD44high memory T cells to acquire a unique innate-like phenotype and secrete IFN-g
for nonspeciﬁc tumor cell killing. This unique immunomodulatory property of ALT-803 strongly supports
its clinical development as a novel immunotherapeutic agent against cancer and viral infections. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy, accounting
for more than 1% of neoplastic diseases and 14% of all
hematologic cancers (1). Multiple myeloma tumor cells are
susceptible to immune cell recognition and elimination, as
shown by the potentially curative graft-versus-myeloma
activity observed in some patients following allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusion therapies (2). However, these approaches are
limited by transplantation-related mortality ranging from
30% to 50% and disease relapse in a majority of patients.
Immunomodulatory chemotherapies, such as lenalidomide,
are also thought to provide therapeutic beneﬁt via mechan-

isms due in part to stimulation of T-cell and/or natural killer
(NK) cell activity against myeloma cells (3). Although survival of patients with multiple myeloma has improved
signiﬁcantly by the use of these novel agents, multiple
myeloma remains incurable due to the persistence of minimal residual disease (4, 5). Thus, novel modalities are
needed to complement or improve the current treatment
options for multiple myeloma.
Interleukin (IL)-15 is a critical cytokine for the development,
proliferation, and activation of effector NK cells and CD8þ
memory T cells (6, 7). IL-15 binds to the IL-15 receptor a (IL15Ra) and is presented in trans to the IL-2/IL-15 receptor b common g chain (IL-15Rbg c) complex on effector cells. IL-15
and IL-2 share binding to the IL-15Rbg c and signal through
STAT3 and STAT5 pathways. However, unlike IL-2, IL-15 does
not support maintenance of CD4þCD25þFoxP3þ regulatory T
(Treg) cells or induce cell death of activated CD8þ T cells (6);
effects that may have limited the therapeutic activity of IL-2
against multiple myeloma (8). In addition, IL-15 is the only
cytokine known to provide antiapoptotic signaling to effector
CD8þ T cells (9). IL-15, either administered alone or as a
complex with the IL-15Ra, exhibits potent antitumor activities
against well-established solid tumors in experimental animal
models and, thus, has been identiﬁed as one of the most

promising immunotherapeutic drugs that could potentially
cure cancer (10–17). However, there have been no reports
showing efﬁcacy of IL-15 against hematologic tumors.
To facilitate clinical development of an IL-15–based cancer
therapeutic, we previously identiﬁed a novel IL-15 mutant with
increased biologic activity compared with IL-15 (18). The
pharmacokinetics and biologic activity of this IL-15 superagonist (IL-15N72D) was further improved by the creation of
IL-15N72D:IL-15RaSu/Fc fusion complex (ALT-803), such that
the superagonist complex has at least 25 times the activity of
the native cytokine in vivo (19). Thus, we hypothesized that
ALT-803 could potentially provide durable, immune cell-mediated antitumor efﬁcacy. We evaluated this hypothesis by using
2 multiple myeloma models in syngeneic immunocompetent
mice. The study also revealed that ALT-803 uses a novel
mechanism of action against myeloma.

Materials and Methods
Mice and tumor cell lines
C57BL/6NHsd and BALB/c mice (5–6 week old females,
Harlan Laboratories) and IFN-g knockout (KO) [B6.129S7Ifngtm1Ts/J] and perforin KO [C57BL/6-Prf1tm1Sdz/J] mice
(5–6 week old females, The Jackson Laboratory) were housed in
the animal facilities at Altor BioScience. All animal studies
were conducted according to NIH animal care guidelines
under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved
protocols.
The murine 5T33 multiple myeloma cell line (20) was kindly
provided by Dr. Ulrich von Andrian, (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA). The murine MOPC-315 myeloma cell line was
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
Tumor cell sublines, 5T33P and MOPC-315P, were developed
by passage of the parental myeloma cells in C57BL/6NHsd and
BALB/c mice, respectively. All cells were routinely cultured in
Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's Medium (HyClone) supplemented
with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (HyClone) at 37 C with 5% CO2
and harvested for animal injection at 80% to 90% conﬂuency.
Tumor models
Following intravenous injection with 1  107 5T33P cells/
mouse, 100% of C57BL/6NHsd mice developed tumor-induced
hind-leg paralysis between 20 and 30 days. Similar tumor take
rates were observed in BALB/c mice following intravenous
injection of 1  107 MOPC-315P cells/mouse. Tumor-bearing
mice were monitored daily for hind-leg paralysis, signs of overt
disease progression, and mortality.
ALT-803 (IL-15N72D:IL-15RaSu/Fc) was generated as
described previously (19). Recombinant human IL-15 (21) was
kindly provided by Dr. Jason Yovandich (National Cancer
Institute, Fredrick, MD). ALT-803 at 0.2 mg/kg/dose (or as
indicated), IL-15 at 0.056 mg/kg/dose (IL-15 molar equivalent
dose of 0.2 mg/kg ALT-803) or PBS as a control was administered intravenously via the lateral tail vein to tumor-bearing
mice. Levels of bone marrow (BM) myeloma cells and hind leg
paralysis or survival were assessed as study end points.
Flow cytometry and ELISA analysis
To quantitate levels of murine lymphocyte subsets, BM,
spleen, lymph node and blood were collected separately from

each mouse, cells were prepared and stained with ﬂuor-labeled
antibodies speciﬁc to CD4, CD8a, CD8b, CD11c, CD19, CD25,
CD40, CD44, CD80, I-A(b), IFN-g, IgG2b, IgA, NK1.1, NKG2D,
NKp46, and/or PD-1, and appropriate isotype controls (eBiosciences, BD Biosciences, and Biolegend) as indicated in ﬁgure
legends. Cell staining was analyzed on a FACSverse (BD
Biosciences). The sorting of NKG2DnegCD25negCD8þCD44high
T cells was conducted with FACS Aria and analyzed with Diva
software (BD Biosciences).
Levels of 5T33P and MOPC-315P cells in BM preparations
and IFN-g in splenocytes were assessed by intracellular
staining with antibodies speciﬁc to IgG2b, IgA and IFN-g,
respectively.
IFN-g levels in mouse serum were quantitated by ELISA
using anti-IFN-g Ab (AN-18) capture and biotinylated anti-IFNg Ab (R4-6A2) detection following the manufacturer's instruction (Biolegend).
In vivo depletion of mouse NK1.1þ cells and CD8þ T cells
For in vivo depletion of NK1.1þ cells and CD8þ T cells, mice
were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200 mg/dose antiNK1.1 (PK136, ATCC) and/or 500 mg/dose anti-CD8 (53-6.72,
ATCC) Abs. Control mice received PBS (0.2 mL). In pilot
studies, the efﬁciency of NK1.1þ cell and CD8þ T-cell depletion
was monitored by ﬂow cytometry following staining of PBMCs
and BM cells with appropriate antibodies.
T-cell labeling and adoptive transfer
CD3þ enriched cells (prepared with Mouse CD3þ T Cell
Enrichment Column, R&D System), CD8þ enriched T cells
[positive, CD8a (Ly-2) MicroBeads, mouse, Miltenyi Biotech] or
sorted NKG2DnegCD25negCD8þCD44high memory T cells from
spleens and lymph nodes of donor C57BL/6NHsd or IFN-g KO
B6 mice were labeled with Celltrace Violet (Invitrogen) at 1.5
mmol/L/1  106 cells/mL, and then 1 to 1.5  106 violet-labeled
cells were adoptively transferred into syngeneic C57BL/6NHsd
or IFN-g KO B6 recipients on study day 0 (SD0). On SD2, mice
were treated (intravenously) with the following test articles:
0.02 mg/kg ALT-803, 0.2 mg/kg ALT-803 or PBS. On SD6,
spleens were harvested and splenocytes were analyzed for
proliferation of donor cells (violet label) or staining with
antibodies speciﬁc to CD25, PD-1, CD44, CD8a, and NKG2D.
In vitro cytotoxicity assay
Tumor target cells (i.e., 5T33P, A20) were labeled with PKH67
(Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
CD8þ T-cell–enriched spleen cells from normal, IFN-g KO, and
perforin KO B6 mice were isolated (untouched, CD8aþ T Cell
Isolation Kit II, mouse, Miltenyi Biotech). Effector populations
were produced by culturing prepared cells (2  107) in RPMI1640 complete media containing ALT-803 (200 ng/mL) for
72 hours. Resulting effector cells were harvested, washed
twice, and replated into 24-well plates with PKH67-labeled
tumor target cells (E:T ratio; 10:1) in media containing varying
doses of ALT-803. After incubation for 20 to 24 hours at 37 C
with 5% CO2, target cell killing was assessed by analysis of
propidium iodide (PI) staining of PKH67-labeled tumor cells on
a BD FACScan cytometer.

IL-15 Superagonist Efﬁcacy against Murine Myeloma

IgG2b and MOPC-315P-speciﬁc IgA paraproteins. In C57BL/
6NHsd mice, IgG2b paraprotein-positive myeloma cell levels
increased to more than 20% of the total BM cells by 21 days
after 5T33P tumor cell inoculation (Supplementary Fig. S1).
A single intravenous treatment of ALT-803 (0.2 mg/kg) had a
marked effect on 5T33P cells in the BM of mice with wellestablished tumors (15 days after tumor implantation),
providing more than 90% reduction in BM IgG2bþ myeloma
cells 4 days after treatment compared with controls (0.8%
versus 11.0%, P  0.02; Fig. 1A). However, a molar equivalent
dose of IL-15 was much less effective and only reduced BM
5T33P cells by 53% compared with PBS-treated mice (P 
0.31). Dose–response studies indicated that a single dose of
ALT-803 at as low as 0.05 mg/kg was capable of reducing
90% of the BM 5T33P myeloma cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). Similar studies in BALB/c mice bearing well-established MOPC-315P tumors conﬁrmed that treatment with
ALT-803, but not IL-15, resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in

Data analysis
Data are expressed as the mean  SE. Survival data was
analyzed using the log-rank test and Kaplan–Meier method.
Comparisons of continuous variables were done using Student
t tests or ANOVA (2-tailed; GraphPad Prism Version 4.03). P
values of less than or equal to 0.05 are considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Efﬁcacy of ALT-803 in murine myeloma models
To conduct efﬁcacy studies in hematologic tumor models,
we derived highly tumorigenic myeloma lines 5T33P and
MOPC-315P from the well-characterized 5T33 and MOPC315 parental lines, respectively, and found that these cells
could populate the BM and cause paralysis following intravenous inoculation of syngeneic mice. Tumor development
in 5T33P-bearing C57BL/6NHsd mice and MOPC-315P-bearing BALB/c mice was assessed by staining myeloma cells in
isolated BM cell preparations for intracellular 5T33P-speciﬁc

CD8þ T cells mediate efﬁcacy of ALT-803 against
myeloma cells
Because ALT-803 treatment effectively eliminated myeloma
cells in vivo, we tested whether ALT-803 had a direct effect on
the viability and proliferation of 5T33P and MOPC-315P cells in
vitro. Neither a decrease in cell numbers nor an increase in
apoptotic cells was observed following incubation of tumor
cells with ALT-803 even at high concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, ALT-803 antimyeloma activity in vivo is
likely due to activation of immune responses rather than direct
killing of tumor cells.
ALT-803 treatment is capable of signiﬁcantly increasing the
number of NK and T cells in vivo (19). To determine if these
immune cells were responsible for ALT-803–mediated antimyeloma efﬁcacy, antibody immunodepletion of CD8þ T cells
and NK1.1þ cells was conducted in tumor-bearing mice before
ALT-803 treatment. Effective depletion of these immune cell
subsets could be achieved by intraperitoneal administration of
anti-CD8 and/or anti-NK1.1 antibodies starting with injections
48 and 24 hours before tumor inoculation and continued
weekly after tumor inoculation (data not shown). When
ALT-803 efﬁcacy was examined in 5T33P-bearing mice, it was

BM myeloma cells compared with controls (P  0.02, ALT803 vs. PBS; P  0.31, IL-15 vs. PBS; Fig. 1B). No toxicity was
observed following treatment, indicating that ALT-803
administration and its antitumor effects, which resulted in
the rapid killing of a large number of myeloma cells over a
short duration, were well tolerated by mice.
ALT-803 effects on mouse survival were also evaluated in
these myeloma models. 5T33P-bearing C57BL/6NHsd mice
treated with a single 0.2 mg/kg dose of ALT-803 showed
signiﬁcantly increased survival when compared with PBStreated mice, which all exhibited hind-leg paralysis (survival
end point) between 21 and 35 days after tumor cell injection
with a median survival time (MST) of 25 days (P  0.006; Fig.
1C). Two or 3 weekly doses of ALT-803 also provided a
signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt in this model (P  0.002, ALT803 vs. PBS; Fig. 1D) and in BALB/c mice bearing MOPC-315P
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Because ALT-803 treatment was capable of essentially curing mice bearing 5T33P myeloma, we evaluated whether these
mice retain immunologic memory against the tumor cells. As
shown in Fig. 1D, C57BL/6NHsd mice that survived initial
5T33P inoculation due to ALT-803 treatment were not affected
by 5T33P cells rechallenge 3 months later, even in the
absence of additional ALT-803 administration. These mice
continued to survive over 190 days from the initial tumor cell
inoculation. In contrast, all of the treatment-na€ve mice
administered with 5T33P cells on the same study day
subsequently exhibited paralysis with a MST of 29 days after
tumor cell injection. Together, these results show that a
short course of ALT-803 treatment has signiﬁcantly greater
antitumor activity against established BM myeloma cells
than IL-15 treatment, resulting in prolonged survival of
myeloma-tumor bearing mice. ALT-803 was also capable of
inducing long-lasting protective immunologic memory
against subsequent tumor cell rechallenge.

Four days after ALT-803 treatment, BM cells were isolated and stained

found that CD8þ T-cell depletion alone or in combination with
NK1.1þ cell depletion, but not NK1.1þ cell depletion alone,
eliminated the antitumor effects of ALT-803 on BM 5T33P
myeloma cells (Fig. 2A). Consistent with these results, antitumor activity correlated with ALT-803–mediated increases in
BM CD8þ T-cell and not NK cell levels (Fig. 2A). We also
conducted immune cell depletion studies in 5T33P-bearing
C57BL/6NHsd mice treated with ALT-803 using survival as the

effectively cured myeloma-bearing mice that otherwise developed paralysis within 28 days (Fig. 2B). Depletion of NK1.1þ
cells had no effect on the antitumor activity of ALT-803,
whereas depletion of CD8þ T cells or both CD8þ T cells and

IL-15 Superagonist Efﬁcacy against Murine Myeloma

results support our conclusion that CD8þ T cells, not NK1.1þ
cells, play a major role in ALT-803-mediated activity against
5T33P cells in C57BL/6NHsd mice.
ALT-803 induces CD8þCD44high memory T cells to
expand, upregulate innate receptors, and exhibit
nonspeciﬁc cytotoxic activity
We have previously shown that a single dose of ALT-803 at
0.2 mg/kg dose level, but not IL-15, could signiﬁcantly
increase the CD8þ T cells and NK cells in na€ve mice (19).
As shown in Fig. 3A, we found that a single dose of ALT-803
(0.2 mg/kg) administered to either normal or 5T33P-bearing
C57BL/6NHsd mice resulted in a similar 3 fold increase in
the percentage of CD8þCD44high memory T cells. This is
consistent with observations by others that certain cytokines, such as IL-12, IL-18, IFN-g, or IL-15, can promote
proliferation of CD8þCD44high T cells, but not the na€ve
CD8þ T cells, in vivo (22–24).
A recent study also showed that certain immunotherapies
promote antigen-nonspeciﬁc expansion of memory CD8þ T
cells with innate-type cell receptors (25). Unlike the memory
CD8þ T cells stimulated by antigen-dependent TCR signaling
that upregulate PD-1 and CD25 cell surface molecules, the
immunotherapy-mediated expanded memory CD8þ T cells
express NKG2D, granzyme B, and possess broadly antigennonspeciﬁc lytic capability. Interestingly, we found that the
splenic memory CD8þ T cells expanded in vivo by ALT-803
treatment also expressed NKG2D and not CD25 or PD-1 (Fig.
3B). To examine ALT-803–mediated changes in this cell population, we isolated CD3þ enriched cells from spleens and
lymph nodes of C57BL/6NHsd mice and labeled them with
Celltrace Violet, and then adoptively transferred these cells
into syngeneic recipients. Two days after transfer, the mice
were treated with PBS or ALT-803 (0.02 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg)
and the phenotype and proliferation of the adoptively transferred cells were examined 4 days later. As shown in Fig. 3C,
ALT-803 treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant, dose-dependent
increase in proliferation of donor CD8þCD44high T cells isolated from spleens of recipient mice, whereas donor memory
CD8þ T cells did not proliferate in PBS-treated mice. In the
expanded memory CD8þ T-cell population from 0.2 mg/kg
ALT-803–treated mice, more than 90% expressed NKG2D with
increased positive staining in cells that underwent multiple
rounds of proliferation. To rule out the possibility that this is
due to an enormous expansion of a small population of
NKG2Dþ cells following ALT-803 treatment, we conducted
similar adoptive transfer studies with sorted NKG2Dneg
CD25negCD8þCD44high T cells labeled with Celltrace Violet.
Treatment of recipient mice with 0.2 mg/kg ALT-803 caused an
increase in NKG2Dþ memory CD8þ T cells from 0% to 13% (Fig.
3D; see gating strategy in Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, ALT803 treatment not only induced the proliferation of the memory CD8þ T cells but also upregulated the NKG2D receptor on
their surface. Donor memory CD8þ T-cell expressing CD25 also
proliferated following ALT-803 treatment but the percentage
of these cells (	4%) was the same in ALT-803– and PBS-treated
mice, consistent with the ﬁndings in 5T33P tumor-bearing
mice.

To assess whether the induced CD8þ T-cell responses were
associated with changes in antigen presentation potential in
vivo, we administered ALT-803 (0.2 mg/kg), LPS (12.5 mg/
mouse), or poly IC (10 mg/mouse) to normal and 5T33P-bearing
C57BL/6NHsd mice and examined the upregulation of activation/maturation markers on BM dendritic cells (DC). We found
that ALT-803, unlike poly IC or LPS, did not increase CD11c,
MHC II (I-Ab), CD80 or CD40 levels on BM DCs (Fig. 4). Similar
results were found for splenic DCs. Thus, the rapid expansion
of CD8þCD44high memory T-cell population stimulated by
ALT-803 is unlikely a result of increased antigen-speciﬁc
responses, consistent with the results of others showing antigen-independent activation of innate-type memory T cells following immunotherapy or microbial or viral infection (26–28).
The cytotoxic activity of ALT-803–treated immune cells was
also examined in vitro. CD8þCD44high T cells increased 5-fold in
splenocytes and 3-fold in CD8þ-enriched splenic T cells from
normal C57BL/6NHsd mice following a 3-day incubation with
0.2 mg/mL ALT-803. Similar to the ﬁndings in vivo, upregulation
of NKG2D but not CD25 or PD-1 was observed on memory
CD8þ T cells following ALT-803 incubation (Fig. 5A). The ALT803–stimulated splenocytes and CD8þ-enriched splenic T cells
exhibited elevated cytolytic activity against 5T33P cells (Fig.
5B) as well as A20 lymphoma cell lines (Fig. 5C). Killing of
5T33P cells was further enhanced by inclusion of ALT-803
during the cytotoxicity assay, suggesting a continued activation of immune cell antitumor activity by ALT-803. Interestingly, 5T33P myeloma-targeted cytotoxicity of ALT-803–stimulated CD8þ enriched splenocytes was not affected by inclusion of an NKG2D-blocking antibody, whereas this antibody
reduced 5T33P killing by whole splenocyte cultures (Fig. 5B).
These results suggest that in vitro cytotoxicity of the NK cells in
the whole splenocyte cultures are dependent on NKG2D,
whereas that of CD8þ T cells does not require NKG2D but
may be mediated through other innate-like activating receptors induced by ALT-803. The cytotoxicity of CD8þ T cells was
partially dependent on perforin expression as CD8þ T cells
obtained from perforin KO mice showed reduced 5T33P cell
killing in this assay (Fig. 5D).
Overall, these studies indicate that ALT-803 potently
induces CD8þCD44high T cells and upregulates innate-cell
receptor NKG2D without the requirement of antigen-speciﬁc
stimulation. Also, this type of ALT-803–stimulated CD8þ
memory T cells exhibit cytotoxic activity against myeloma
and other tumor cells.
Serum IFN-g is elevated by ALT-803 treatment in a CD8þ
T-cell–dependent manner and is required for ALT-803–
mediated efﬁcacy
In addition to stimulating immune cells, we found that a
single dose of ALT-803 to C57BL/6NHsd mice could signiﬁcantly increase serum IFN-g levels (Fig. 6A). Immune-depletion
studies were then carried out to identify the immune cell types
responsible for IFN-g production after ALT-803 treatment. As
shown in Fig. 6A, depletion of CD8þ T cells, but not NK1.1þ
cells, eliminated most of the high-level expression of serum
IFN-g, indicating that CD8þ T cells were the dominant source
of ALT-803-induced IFN-g. To further determine whether

CD8þCD44high memory or CD8þCD44low na€ve T cells were the
primary producers of IFN-g after ALT-803 treatment, we
analyzed IFN-g production of splenic CD8þ T cells from
ALT-803–treated mice. Intracellular IFN-g was detectable as
early as 12 hours after ALT-803 treatment in the CD8þCD44high
memory T-cell population and the percentage of IFNg–producing memory T cells continued to remain elevated
for at least 48 hours after ALT-803 treatment (Fig. 6B). Significant ALT-803–mediated induction of intracellular IFN-g was
not observed in CD8þCD44low na€ve T cells. Thus, ALT-803
activates CD8þCD44high memory T cells to proliferate and
secrete IFN-g via an antigen-independent pathway.
To determine whether induced IFN-g plays a role in the
antimyeloma activity of ALT-803, treatment effects on survival
were evaluated in IFN-g KO B6 mice bearing 5T33P cells.
Similar to the ﬁndings in myeloma-bearing C57BL/6NHsd
mice following CD8þ T-cell depletion, ALT-803 treatment
provided little or no protection from mortality to IFN-g KO
mice after 5T33P cell inoculation, indicating IFN-g is required

for ALT-803 efﬁcacy (Fig. 6C). However, IFN-g had no direct
effect on 5T33P cell growth or apoptosis in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S3), consistent with previous reports (29). These
results support a mechanism where ALT-803 activates IFN-g
production and cytotoxic activity of CD8þ memory T cells and
together these responses promote rapid elimination of myeloma cells and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice.
To assess whether IFN-g is needed for ALT-803–mediated
effects on CD8þ memory T-cell responses, adoptive cell transfer studies were conducted using donor Celltrace Violetlabeled CD8þ T cells from IFN-g KO mice transferred into
IFN-g KO and wild-type recipient mice. As shown in Fig. 7, ALT803 treatment of IFN-g KO or wild-type recipients induced
comparable CD8þCD44high memory T-cell proliferation and
upregulation of NKG2D of the adoptively transferred cells. This
indicates that ALT-803–induced CD8þCD44high memory T cell
responses were IFN-g independent. Interestingly, we also
found that that CD8þ T cells isolated from IFN-g KO mice
exhibited less ALT-803–stimulated in vitro cytotoxic activity

against 5T33P cells than was observed in CD8þ T cells from
normal C57BL/6NHsd mice (Fig. 5D). Together, these results
suggest that while IFN-g is not required for ALT-803–mediated
activation and expansion of CD8þ memory T cells, it still plays
a role in augmenting the cytotoxicity of these cells against
tumors via an as yet undetermined mechanism.

Discussion
IL-15 and IL-15Ra are coexpressed and form a protein
complex in antigen-presenting cells for trans-presentation to
T and NK cells (6). Studies have shown that soluble IL-15:IL15Ra complexes exhibit a 50-fold better immune stimulatory
activity in vivo than IL-15 alone (10) and potent efﬁcacy against
solid and metastatic tumors in various mouse models (11–13);

however, its activity against hematologic tumors has not been
reported. In this study, we describe the antimyeloma activity
and mechanism of action of ALT-803, a protein complex
consisting of an IL-15 superagonist mutant associated with
a dimeric IL-15RaSu/Fc fusion protein (18, 19). We found that a
single dose of ALT-803 was much more effective than IL-15 at
reducing the levels of well-established murine 5T33P and
MOPC-315P myeloma cells in the BM of tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice. ALT-803 was also found to prolong survival
of 5T33P and MOPC-315P tumor-bearing mice and effectively
cured a majority of the mice of tumors. Moreover, 5T33Pbearing mice cured by prior ALT-803 treatment were protected
against subsequent 5T33P rechallenge, indicating that ALT803 mediated the induction of long-lasting antimyeloma

created an FcgR-binding deﬁcient derivative of ALT-803 for
studies to further evaluate the contribution of the Fc-g domain
to ALT-803–mediated immune stimulation.
Previous studies have shown that IL-15 and IL-15:IL-15Ra
complexes can stimulate antitumor activity via either effector
NK cells or T cells, showing the remarkable capacity of IL-15 to
induce different effector cell responses against diverse tumor
types and tumor microenvironments (11–14, 16). In the 5T33P
myeloma model reported here, we found that treatment with
ALT-803 resulted in an increase in CD8þ T-cell levels in the BM
of tumor-bearing mice that correlated with the complex's

immune memory responses. These results are consistent with
our previous report that ALT-803 exhibited signiﬁcantly better
activity compared with IL-15 in stimulating NK cell and CD8þ
T-cell responses in vivo (19). This enhanced immunostimulatory activity is likely the result of a combination of the
increased in vivo half-life of ALT-803 compared with IL-15
(25 hours vs. <40 minutes) and the dimeric nature of the
cytokine domain in the complex increasing its binding avidity
to IL-15Rbg c (19). It is also possible that the Fc domain of the
complex enables trans-presentation of the cytokine to IL15Rbg c receptor-bearing NK and T cells via binding to the

ability to reduce BM 5T33P-cell burden. However, systemic
depletion of CD8þ T cells, but not NK1.1þ cells, was shown to
largely eliminate the antitumor activity of ALT-803 on BM
myeloma cells and the treatment-related survival beneﬁt in
5T33P-bearing mice. This indicates that CD8þ T cells, but not
NK1.1þ cells, play a pivotal role in ALT-803 antimyeloma
activity. This ﬁnding is perplexing since we found that a single

myeloma cells 4 days after treatment. Such a robust and rapid
onset of immune responses is generally believed to only be
associated with the innate immune system. In addition, we
further found that a single dose of ALT-803 was capable of
inducing high serum levels of IFN-g and promoting the proliferation of CD8þ T cells in non–tumor bearing mice shortly
after treatment. The source of serum IFN-g was largely from
CD8þCD44high T cells, not NK1.1þ cells, based on our immunedepletion analysis. Therefore, we questioned whether the
activation of CD8þ T cells and subsequent antitumor activity
mediated by ALT-803 was antigen dependent. To address this,
we examined whether ALT-803 induced dendritic cell activation/maturation. Our ﬁnding that ALT-803 treatment did not
upregulate CD11c, CD80, MHC-II, and CD40 in BM and splenic
DCs from either tumor- or non–tumor-bearing mice suggested
that ALT-803 did not promote antigen presentation at the
initial phase of the immune response. Thus, it seems unlikely
that antigen-dependent clonal expansion of na€ve CD8þ T cells
immediately after ALT-803 treatment is responsible for the
potent antimyeloma activity observed in mice bearing established 5T33P and MOPC-315P tumors.
The proliferation of memory-phenotype (CD44high) CD8þ T
cells, but not na€ve CD8þ T cells, can be induced in vivo by the
cytokines IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-g, most likely via production of
IL-15, or directly by IL-15 (22–24). A recent study also showed
that cytokine-mediated stimulation could promote antigennonspeciﬁc expansion of memory CD8þ T cells with a unique
phenotype (25). Unlike TCR signaling that upregulates PD-1
and CD25 surface markers on memory CD8þ T cells, treatment
with IL-2 in combination with anti-CD40 antibody resulted in
expansion of memory CD8þ T cells that express NKG2D,
granzyme B, and possess broad lytic capabilities. These cells
have been suggested to be responsible for the dramatic antitumor effects of this therapy in animal models (26–28). Herein,
using the adoptive-cell transfer approach, we showed that
ALT-803 alone could also induce CD8þCD44high memory T
cells, but not na€ve T cells, to acquire innate cell receptors, such
as NKG2D, without inducing PD-1, in vitro and in vivo. ALT-803
seems to act by both inducing CD8þ memory T-cell proliferation and upregulating NKG2D expression rather than preferentially expanding preexisting CD8þCD44high memory T
cells carrying this receptor. In vitro, the ALT-803–activated
CD8þCD44high memory T cells exhibited antigen-nonspeciﬁc
and potent antitumor activity against 5T33P myeloma.
Because of the presence of the large numbers of the
CD8þCD44high memory T cells after ALT-803 treatment with
an innate-like phenotype and their high antitumor activity, it
is conceivable that these cells represented the main effector

cells responsible for mounting robust and rapid immune
responses against myeloma in the initial phase after ALT-803
infusion.
A single dose of ALT-803 was capable of inducing high
serum levels of IFN-g in mice. This activity seemed to be
different from that in previous studies in which monotherapy with IL-15 or single-chain IL-15:IL-15Ra complexes was
shown to induce mouse immune cell proliferation, but not to
affect serum IFN-g levels (30, 31). IL-15 has been reported to
elevate IFN-g levels in vivo when coadministered with IL-12,
IL-18, or other immunostimulatory molecules via a cytokine
feedback cascade involving NK cells and macrophages (7). In
contrast, we show that the effect of ALT-803 on serum IFN-g
levels was largely dependent on CD8þCD44high memory T
cells and not NK1.1þ cells. It has been found that treatment
of mice with IL-15:IL-15Ra/Fc complexes similar to ALT-803
can cause na€ve CD8þ T cells to expand and acquire an
activated phenotype that includes the ability to secrete IFNg and mediate antigen-speciﬁc cytolytic function (10). These
responses were dependent on MHC class I molecules, TCR
avidity and were enhanced in the presence of peptide
antigen (32), suggesting that IL-15:IL-15Ra/Fc complexes
increase the sensitivity and responsiveness of na€ve CD8þ T
cells to endogenous antigen presentation. In contrast, ALT803 has the unique feature of inducing high levels of serum
IFN-g by activating CD8þ memory T cells in an antigenindependent fashion in vivo. Although IFN-g has no direct
effects on growth or induction of apoptosis of 5T33P tumor
cells in vitro as shown in this study, the loss of treatmentmediated antimyeloma activity in the IFN-g KO mice bearing
5T33 tumors shows the pivotal role of IFN-g in the therapeutic potency of ALT-803. The effect of IFN-g on ALT-803
antitumor activity is apparently via an indirect mechanism
as ALT-803 did not lose its ability to induce IFN-g–deﬁcient
CD8þCD44high memory T cells in IFN-g KO mice.
IFN-g is a remarkable cytokine that orchestrates a diverse
array of cellular programs through transcriptional regulation
of immunologically relevant genes (33). IFN-g skews the
immune response toward a T-helper (TH) 1 phenotype by
inducing T-bet, a critical transcription factor of TH1 cells,
which directly induces many TH1 cell-related genes, but indirectly suppresses the TH2 cell-related genes (34). IFN-g also
orchestrates the trafﬁcking of speciﬁc immune cells to sites of
inﬂammation (e.g., tumor sites) through upregulating expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and chemokines (e.g., IP-10, MCP-1, MIG-1a/b, RANTES; refs. 35–42).
Thus, the loss of IFN-g could lead to the loss of the TH1 cell-type
antitumor environment and the inability to upregulate the
necessary chemokine receptors and/or adhesion molecules on
the ALT-803–activated CD8þCD44high T cells for trafﬁcking to
the tumor site. In addition, IFN-g is a potent activator of
macrophages that kill pathogens and tumor cells by producing
reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen intermediates via
induction of NADPH oxidase system and INOS (43–45). IFN-g is
also known to repolarize the stage M2 tumor-promoting
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) to M1 tumor-destroying macrophages at the tumor sites, which in turn could mount
an effective immune response against tumors (46, 47).

IL-15 Superagonist Efﬁcacy against Murine Myeloma

Thus, IFN-g secreted by ALT-803–activated memory T cells
could signiﬁcantly contribute to the antitumor potency of
ALT-803 by directly activating macrophages to enhance their
tumor-killing activities or to repolarize the TAMs for tumor
destruction.
In summary, we reveal the novel mechanism of action of
ALT-803, an IL-15 superagonist complex, against multiple
myeloma that acts mainly through its stimulation of CD8þ
CD44high memory T cells to expand, acquire an innate-type
phenotype and secrete IFN-g independent of antigen requirement resulting in enhancement of host survival. These ﬁndings
suggest a novel therapeutic strategy of exploiting the innatecell function of adoptive immune cells. Although our results
suggest clinical application for treatment of multiple myeloma,
this IL-15–based approach may also be efﬁcacious for other
cancers and infectious diseases.
