ABSTRACT
Cells induced into senescence exhibit a marked increase in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
Here we report that SASP from senescent stromal fibroblasts promote spontaneous
morphological changes accompanied by an aggressive migratory behavior in originally
non-motile human breast cancer cells. This phenotypic switch is coordinated, in
space and time, by a dramatic reorganization of the actin and microtubule filament
networks, a discrete polarization of EB1 comets, and an unconventional front-to-back
inversion of nucleus-MTOC polarity. SASP-induced morphological/migratory changes
are critically dependent on microtubule integrity and dynamics, and are coordinated
by the inhibition of RhoA and cell contractility. RhoA/ROCK inhibition reduces focal
adhesions and traction forces, while promoting a novel gliding mode of migration.

INTRODUCTION

Despite their anti-tumorigenicity, senescent cells
can contribute to neoplastic progression by promoting
a pro-inflammatory environment. Transcriptional
changes that accompany senescence promote a robust
increase in mRNA, translation and the secretion of
cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and proteases
[4-6]. This complex senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) promotes tissue remodeling and
stimulates a malignant phenotype and tumor progression
in neighboring epithelial cells. In particular, this proinflammatory stimulus elicits aggressive cancer behavior,
including enhanced invasion, proliferation, loss of cellto-cell contacts and an apparent epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) [5, 7-10]. The molecular mechanism
underlying this aggressive tumor cell behavior, in
particular a transition from a non-motile to motile
phenotype, remains largely unknown.
Here, we showed that factors secreted by senescent
stromal fibroblasts promote a dramatic morphological
change in otherwise round, non-motile cancer cells.

Advanced age is the main risk factor for a
range of human pathologies, including cardiovascular,
neurodegenerative and neoplastic syndromes. Ageing
involves the accumulation of damage to macromolecules
(i.e. nuclear DNA damage, misfolded proteins, and
mitochondrial DNA deletions). Ageing-induced damage
leads to the malfunction of organelles and promotes
cellular defects and tissue dysfunction [1-3]. Age-related
pathologies and deficits are, in part, a result of the
accumulation of senescent cells in the aging organism [1,
4]. Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth
arrest that occurs as a result of oncogenic stimulus or
genomic stress. This includes telomere erosion, DNA
double-strand breaks, genetic defects and overexpression
of oncogenes, such as KRAS [4, 5]. Growth arrest prevents
the perpetuation of cellular damage from one generation
to the next and thus provides a potent tumor-suppressive
mechanism to cells exposed to oncogenic stimuli.

This morphological change is accompanied by a strong
migratory phenotype in originally non-motile human breast
cancer cells. The SASP-induced morphological/migratory
switch is associated with a dramatic reorganization of
both F-actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks.
Such transitions from a non-motile-to-motile phenotype
feature little to no lamellipodial protrusions. Most
strikingly, SASP-induced local cellular migrations feature
microtubule-enriched tails trailing the migrating cell,
with significantly reduced actin assembly along the cell
edges. SASP-stimulated cells also display a non-uniform
spatial redistribution of microtubule-terminating EB1
comets. Paradoxically, migrating cells conformed to an
unconventional inverse, front-to-back polarity of their
nucleus and microtubule-organizing center (MTOC); the
nucleus is located at the leading migratory front of the cell
instead of conventional nuclear positioning at the trailing
edge of the cell. This SASP-induced phenotypic switch
is mediated by microtubule integrity and dynamics, as
well as the inhibition of Rho/ROCK/myosin mediated cell
contractility. We demonstrate that Rho inhibition is both
necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain the SASPinduced morphological and migratory behavior of cancer
cells. SASP-induced inhibition of RhoA reduces the size
and number of focal adhesions and diminishes traction
forces, inducing a gliding mode of migration.

change in cell morphology, from initially rounded and
large to elongated and small in size (Figure 1a, 1c and
1d, Movie S1b). Cells typically featured 1 to 3 long
and thick extensions projected towards the back or the
sides of the cell (Figure 1a and 1d). Before Sen CM was
added, less than 5% of T47D cells displayed an elongated
morphology. However, 24h and 48h after exposure to
Sen CM, the fraction of cells presenting an elongated
morphology increased to 61% and 67%, respectively
(Figure 1b). SASP-induced elongated morphology and
triggered migration were also observed with T47D cells
exposed to Sen CM from BJ human skin fibroblasts and
IMR-90 human lung fibroblasts, suggesting that this is not
a cell-specific effect that is unique to WI-38 cells (Figure
S2).
We next investigated the functional consequences
of this drastic morphological switch. The SASP-induced
morphological change was accompanied by the onset
of cell migration (Figure 1d-1e and Movie S1c). The
transition from a rounded, non-motile phenotype to an
elongated, motile phenotype occurred within minutes in
the presence of Sen CM. To quantify the dynamic change
in cell morphology and migration, we simultaneously
measured the instantaneous cell speed and time-dependent
cell morphological parameters, including cell circularity
and cell size (Figure 1e). When cellular circularity and area
changed abruptly (blue dotted line), cell speed changed
almost simultaneously. This was further demonstrated by
analysis of the temporal cross-correlation between cell
circularity and speed with the greatest correlation observed
at a time lag of almost 0 (i.e., morphological change and
onset of migration coincided) (Figure 1f).
The mean square displacement (MSD) of cells
computed from the coordinates of the centroids of
cells is an effective means to quantify cell migration.
We compared the MSDs of cells that changed their
morphology and became elongated to cells that maintained
their original morphology (circular and round) in response
to Sen CM (Figure 1g). Horizontal lines in Figure 1g
indicate the averaged cell area of each cell type; they
indicate that only elongated cells migrated more than their
average size during imaging. Elongated cells displayed
significantly higher MSDs than cells that remained round
over all probed time lags, indicating that only cells that
underwent a round-to-elongated morphological switch in
response to SASP could migrate and translocate (Figure 1h
and 1i). Migration was also verified using a 3D spheroid
assay. Within 24 h exposure to Sen CM (compared to FM),
an aggregate of cells embedded in collagen I disseminated
into their surrounding collagen network (Figure S2, b and
c).
For typical mesenchymal cells, migration requires
cell-induced traction forces exerted on the underlying
substratum, as cells attach to form new adhesions at the
leading edge and detach to disassemble adhesions at the
rear of the cell [14-16]. To determine the traction forces

RESULTS
SASP-induced change in cell morphology is
accompanied by onset of migration
To induce cellular senescence, human lung (WI38) fibroblasts, were treated with bleomycin and allowed
to recover for 8 days. Proliferation status of fibroblasts
was verified by Ki-67 staining (Figure S1, a and b) and
by directly assessing cell doubling (Figure S1c). WI-38
cells developed senescent associated heterochromatic foci
observed with phosphorylated H2A.X staining (Figure
S1d-g). Cells also drastically increase their cell size, a key
morphological feature of senescence (Figure S1h). Cellular
senescence induced by bleomycin was accompanied by a
robust senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),
including elevated levels of interleukins IL-6 and IL-8
(Figure S1, i and j) [11, 12].
To determine whether SASP endowed cancer cells
with an aggressive behavior, non-motile, T47D human
epithelial breast cancer cells were exposed to conditioned
medium from senescent cells (Sen CM). We note that both
WI-38 and T47D are standard cell lines used extensively
to study the interplay between senescence of fibroblasts
and cancer [5, 7, 13]. As previously observed, Sen CM
promoted loss of cell-to-cell contact [5]. However,
stimulating cells with Sen CM caused a dramatic

exerted by cells exposed to SASP, cells were plated on
an inert elastic gel containing 0.2µm-diameter fluorescent
beads. Round cells significantly displaced the embedded
fluorescent beads and isotropically produced traction
forces onto underlying substrate (Figure 1j). Elongated
cells, however, generated significantly reduced traction
forces (Figure 1j). Traction forces were mainly confined
to the leading edge of the cell. Computed traction (root
mean square) averaged over the entire cell projected
area, maximum cumulative force, and net contractile
moment (a scalar measure of cell’s contractile strength)
were remarkably greater in round cells than elongated
cells (Figure 1k-1m). Accordingly, motile, elongated cells
displayed significantly decreased contractility compared to
their round, non-motile counterparts.

microtubule polymers were located in the core (Figure 2d
and 2e). A similar morphological changed occurred when
MCF7 cells were exposed to Sen CM (Figure S3a). T47D
cells exposed to Sen CM from BJ and IMR-90 fibroblasts
also underwent the same cytoskeletal changes, indicating
that cytoskeletal reorganization was independent of the
cells from which Sen CM was obtained (Figure S3, b and
c). Consistent with reduced traction forces (Figure 1k),
vinculin staining revealed a decrease in focal adhesions in
elongated cells compared to round cells, which displayed
larger focal adhesions along the cell cortex (Figure 2h).
In addition to changes in microtubule organization
in response to SASP stimulation, we determined
next whether microtubule dynamics was also altered.
Microtubule dynamics is typically assessed by quantifying
the dynamics of EB1, a microtubule plus-end protein
(+TIP) that tracks the dynamic assembly of microtubules
[19]. Cells were transfected with EB1-EGFP, exposed to
Sen CM, and imaged by live-cell confocal microscopy.
Microtubule assembly dynamics, as measured by tracking
EB1 comets, was similar in round and elongated cells
(Figure S2d). Individual images collected 1s apart for
10s were overlay to display the cumulative directionality
of EB1 comets. As expected, EB1 comets in round cells
showed isotropic directionality (Figure 2i and Movie S2a).
In contrast, elongated cells showed polarized EB1 comets
(Figure 2k and Movie S2b). EB1 comets were enriched in
the cell front and extensions, and disorganized within the
cell body. In cells having multiple extensions, comets were
enriched and directional in each extension, and comets
showed no preferred directionality within the cell body
(Figure S2e and Movie S2c). The directionality of actively
growing EB1 comets, further quantified by computing
their time-dependent angular distributions, indicated that
elongated cells had EB1 growth mainly in the polarized
direction of the moving cell (Figure 2j and 2l).
Another unique feature of SASP-induced cell
migration was that originally non-polarized cells that
were set in motion adopted an inverse, “front-to-back”
polarization in response to SASP stimulation (Figure
2m-2n, Figure S3f and Table 1). Here, migrating cells
positioned their nucleus in the very front of the cell, while
the MTOC was located behind the nucleus towards the
back of the cell, where front and back are defined by the
direction of cell migration. Importantly, this mode of
polarization differed from the same cells stimulated to
migrate with a scratch-wound. Here, cells oriented their
MTOC toward the direction of migration with the nucleus
in the back (Figure 2o), which the conventional positions
of MTOC and nucleus in many types of migratory cells
[20, 21]. Hence, this MTOC-nucleus inverse polarization
was not an intrinsic property of these cells, but rather a
universal response to SASP stimulation. We note that
SASP-exposed round and elongated cells did not feature
significant differences in either the distance between the
MTOC and nuclear surface or the distance between the

SASP-induces cytoskeletal reorganization and
MTOC- nucleus polarization
Cell morphology and motility are typically
controlled by the cytoskeleton, a dense network of
filamentous proteins, including intermediate filaments,
actin, and microtubules [16, 17]. The roles of the
cytoskeleton in SASP-induced morphological change
and the onset of migration are unknown. Traditionally,
filamentous actin (F-actin) and the associated F-actinbundling and motor protein myosin II produce the required
forces for migration and shape changes accompanying
cell migration [16, 18]. In contrast, microtubules, which
stem from the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC or
centrosome), set the polarization axis of cells. The MTOC
is positioned at the front of the cell, while the nucleus is
positioned at the back [16, 18].
An important feature of SASP-induced migration
was that cells displayed non-standard cytoskeletal
organization. In typical migratory mesenchymal cells
such as fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells, microtubules
are mainly organized throughout the cell body, while actin
filaments form a dendritic network in the lamellipodium
and stress fibers at the basal surface (Figure 2a). Threedimensional confocal fluorescence images were collected
to visualize the cytoskeletal structures of cells exposed
to Sen CM (Figure 2b and 2c). Round cells displayed
a dense F-actin meshwork along the cell cortex, with
punctate structures within the cell body. Microtubules
were organized in dense networks in the cell body and
at the cell periphery (Figure 2b). In striking contrast,
elongated cells displayed punctate actin in the cortical
region of the cell, with significantly reduced actin-rich
edges (Figure 2c-2g and Table 1). Within the elongated
cell, microtubules formed thin disorganized structures
near the nucleus and thick linear bundles in the cell tails
(Figure 2c and 2d). Cross-sectional views of cell tails
revealed that F-actin and microtubules were spatially
segregated: actin filaments formed a corona and bundled

of Rho, ROCK and myosin II ATPase activity by CT04,
Y27632, and blebbistatin respectively. We observed
more extensions per cell; cells had > 4 extensions when
treated with actin and Rho/ROCK/myosin inhibitors in
the presence of Sen CM (Figure 4a). Moreover, these
inhibitors promoted an increase in the number of cells with
an elongated morphology and microtubule-rich extensions
compared to Sen CM alone (Figure 4b).
These treatments, however, had differential effects
on cell migration. Depolymerization of F-actin with
Latrunculin B blocked cell migration regardless of the
presence of cell extensions. However, CT04, Y27632, and
blebbistatin treatment only induced a slight decrease in the
displacement of cells (Figure 4c-4e and Movie S4 a-d).
With CT04, Y27632, and blebbistatin treatment some cells
displayed a “caged” pattern, where cellular motions are
confined within cell extensions and failed to move beyond
their own average size (Movie S4b).

Role of microtubule integrity and dynamics in
SASP-induced morphology and migration
We next aimed to decipher the molecular
mechanisms driving this unconventional mode of
migration (Table 1). To study the contribution of
microtubules to SASP-induced migration, cells were
treated with microtubule-depolymerizing (nocodazole)
and -stabilizing (taxol) agents. Treatment with nocodazole
abrogated SASP-induced morphological changes and
prevented the formation of cell tails (Figure 3a and 3b,
Movie S3a-c). Cells not only failed to respond to Sen
CM in the presence of nocodazole, but also retained the
cytoskeletal organization of cells that remained round
following SASP stimulation, with the formation of stress
fibers in some cells (data not shown). Taxol-treated cells,
however, did not form long cell trails, rather, they were
shorter and less dynamic (Figure 3a and 3b; Movie S3d).
Treatment with nocodazole additionally prevented the
decrease in focal adhesions caused by Sen CM (Figure 2h,
second panel), while taxol treatment did not enable any
obvious change in focal adhesions when compared to Sen
CM alone (Figure 3c). Treatment with nocodazole also
prevented a SASP-induced decrease in cell traction and
contractility and displayed contractile properties similar to
cells that remained round in response to Sen CM (Figure
3d-3g, Figure 1j-1m). Both microtubule depolymerization
and stabilization, however, significantly reduced cell
migration in the presence of Sen CM (Figure 3h-3j).

Actomyosin regulation of
morphology and migration

Rho and contractility inhibition is required
to promote and maintain the SASP-induced
phenotype
Because the inhibition of Rho activity promoted
an increase in the number of cell extensions, we next
determined whether the reduction of Rho activity was
involved in the promotion of an elongated, motile
phenotype in the presence of Sen CM. The levels of
activated RhoA (RhoA-GTP) were compared between
cells exposed to serum-free fresh medium (FM) and Sen
CM (Figure 5a, Figure S4a). Cells exposed to Sen CM
showed decreased RhoA activity. Hence, we hypothesized
that SASP-stimulated morphological and migratory
phenotypes were mediated via RhoA GTPase inhibition.
To assess this, cells were treated with CN03, a constitutive
activator of RhoA, in the presence of Sen CM. Cells
retained their round morphology (similar to nocodazole
treatment) and failed to form cell extensions (Figure 5b
and 5c). As shown in Figure 5b, cells treated with CN03
showed organized F-actin within the cell body while
displayed disorganized microtubule (i.e. similar to cells
treated with FM and/or cell that remained round upon Sen
CM stimulation). Further, by constitutively active RhoA,
only ~5% of cells formed cell extensions and displayed
insignificant differences in the percentage of cells with
extensions when compared to cells exposed to FM alone
(Figure 5c). Similar results were also obtained when T47D
cells were transfected with constitutively active RhoA
mutant and then exposed to Sen CM; cells expressing high
amounts of the Myc-RhoA-Q63L remained round and
displayed increased basal stress fibers (Figure S4, b-d).
Because cells treated with CN03 in the presence of
Sen CM retained a similar morphology to round control
cells, we next examined if constitutively activating RhoA
would restore focal adhesion assembly in response to Sen

SASP-induced

In addition to microtubule dynamics, actin filament
network remodeling plays a key role in cell polarization
and migration. Members of the Rho family of GTPases
are critical regulators of actin and microtubule cytoskeletal
networks in response to extracellular signals [16, 22].
Recent work has demonstrated a functional crosstalk
between microtubules and RhoA, a master regulator of
actin filament organization, cell morphology, and cell
contractility through the activation of downstream targets
[23, 24]. These include Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase
(ROCK), which acts as a regulator of myosin light chain
(MLC) phosphorylation via phosphorylating and inhibiting
myosin light chain phosphatase. To assess the role of
F-actin and its regulators in the promotion of SASPinduced morphological and migratory changes, cells were
treated with small-molecule inhibitors of the actomyosin
network (Figure 4a). Surprisingly, when actin assembly
was inhibited with Latrunculin B, SASP-stimulated
cells generated more, but shorter extensions (Figure 4a).
Similar responses were observed following the inhibition

CM. Cells displayed large focal adhesions along the cell
cortex following RhoA activation (Figure 5d); however,
vinculin staining revealed larger focal adhesions than
control, round cells in the presence of Sen CM. Treatment
with CN03 additionally prevented a SASP-mediated
decrease in traction force and cell contractility and further
enhanced it beyond the FM control (Figure 5e-5h). CN03
treatment also prevented changes in polarization seen
with Sen CM (Figure 5i). Constitutively activating RhoA
abrogated SASP-induced migration: the MSD of cells with
activated Rho in the presence of Sen CM was similar to
that of cells in FM (Figure 5j-5l).
We next asked whether RhoA inhibition was
required to maintain SASP-induced morphology and
migration (Figure 5n-5r). Cells were exposed to Sen
CM for 48h to allow for morphological and migratory
changes to occur, and then they were treated with CN03
for 24h in the continued presence of Sen CM. CN03treated cells retracted their extensions and reverted back
to a round morphology, with dense actin at the cortex
and disorganized microtubules (Figure 5m). The percent
of cells featuring trails decreased from ~70% to ~14%
(Figure 5o). To observe this transition, cells were imaged
for 24h with Sen CM alone followed by additional 24h
after CN03treatment. Before treatment (10h), cells were
still motile and featured long extensions; however, within
a few minutes of CN03 treatment cells began to retract

their tails and rapidly decreased migration concurrently
(Figure 5n). Cell migration was further quantified between
24h pre and post treatment. Cells having constitutively
active RhoA displayed significantly decreased migration
regardless of SASP exposure (Figure 5p-5r). These results
suggest that RhoA is critical for both the promotion
and the maintenance of SASP-induced morphological,
migratory, and force-generation changes.

Inhibition of the Rho/ROCK/myosin II pathway
recapitulates SASP-induced phenotype
We asked whether the reduction of Rho alone was
sufficient to promote and recapitulate SASP-induced
morphological changes. Surprisingly, treatment with
Rho inhibitor CT04 in FM promoted a similar formation
of microtubule-rich cell extensions (Figure 6a). Cells
transitioned from a round morphology and cytoskeletal
organization, and adopted characteristics similar to
those exposed to Sen CM alone. Similar results were
also obtained when T47D cells were transfected with a
dominant negative RhoA mutant and then exposed to FM
(Figure S4, a-c).
Inhibition of either ROCK or myosin II activity
resulted in similar cellular phenotypes. Cells that
adopted an elongated phenotype with Rho inhibition

significantly diminished focal adhesions like Sen CM
exposed elongated cells (Figure 6b). Furthermore, Rho
inhibition had a significant decrease in traction forces
and contractility (Figure 6c-6f), down to values similar
to those found in SASP-induced elongated cells (Figure
1, j-m). Rho inhibition also promoted an inverse, frontto-back polarization similar to SASP stimulation (Figure
6g, Figure S Figure 4e). Although cells treated with
CT04 displayed similar microtubule organization to cells
stimulated with Sen CM, we aimed to determine if EndBinding protein 1 (EB1) organization and directionality
was recapitulated as well. Individual images collected
1s apart for 10s were overlay to display the cumulative
directionality of EB1 comets. EB1 comets of cells in
FM showed isotropic directionality (Figure 6h). Cells
treated with CT04 alone, however, adopted polarized
directionality (Figure 6j), where EB1 comets were
enriched in the direction of cell tails. The directionality
of actively growing EB1 comets, quantified by computing
their time-dependent angular distributions, indicated that
elongated cells had EB1 had polarized comets in the
direction of the moving cell (Figure 6i and 6k).
Although morphology, traction forces, focal
adhesion formation, and anisotropic EB1 dynamics
were all recapitulated by direct Rho/ROCK/myosin II
inhibition, we next wanted to assess whether migration
was also similar to that of cells exposed to Sen CM.
Analysis of MSDs showed that the inhibition of the Rho/
ROCK/myosin II pathway in the absence of Sen CM was
sufficient to recapitulate the migratory phenotype induced
by Sen CM (Figure 6l-6n).

lacking cortex, along with a decrease in focal adhesions.
Morphological changes are associated with the
redistribution of the directionality of microtubule end
binding protein EB1, as well as the promotion of an
inverse, front-back polarity. In conventional mesenchymal
migration, cells place their nucleus at the back and the
MTOC at the front of the cell, a polarization that is tightly
regulated by a myriad of proteins, including Cdc42 and
PAR proteins [18, 26]. This inverse polarization has
mainly been observed in migrating T cells and neutrophils
[16, 22, 27], and not typically in mesenchymal or epithelial
cells. Posterior MTOC position has however been seen
with fibroblasts on constricted on fibrillar 1D patterns
and 3D extracellular matrixes [28]. Similar inverse
polarization was observed with Rho inhibition, suggesting
a possible role of Rho in MTOC orientation. Changes in
protein distribution and cell polarity may enable lateral
movement in originally non-motile, non-polarized cells.
Microtubules are not believed to play “motor”
function in conventional mesenchymal cell migration,
but rather are required for establishing cell polarity [29].
Our results, however, demonstrate the integral role of
microtubule assembly and dynamics in SASP-induced
changes in cell morphology and onset of migration. Here,
the inhibition of microtubule polymerization essentially
prevented the formation of cell extensions and inhibited
cell migration. Nocodazole treatment also prevented
the decrease in focal adhesions and cell contractility.
Microtubules sequester guanine nucleotide-exchange
factors (GEF) that stimulate RhoA GTPase activation
[22, 23, 30]. Depolymerization of microtubules in
SASP stimulated cells may therefore enable RhoA
activation, which may promote actin filament assembly.
This may further prevent the depletion of the actin-rich
cortex, the loss of focal adhesions and the decrease in
cell contractility with Sen CM stimulation. Although
microtubule stabilization also decreased cell movement,
it did not prevent the formation of cell tails, but reduced
their lengths and dynamics. Taxol treatment failed to
induce a significant change in focal adhesion assembly
when compared to SASP-induced elongated cells. This
suggests the lack of involvement of microtubule dynamics
in regulating SASP-induced morphological changes.
These results collectively indicate that while microtubule
integrity is required for driving the morphological
transition from a round to an elongated phenotype, both
its integrity and dynamics were essential for robust SASPinduced cell migration.
In typical migrating cells, RhoA mediates the
formation of actin stress fibers, the generation of
contractile forces required for cell tail retraction at
the trailing edge, and the promotion of focal adhesion
turnover [31] [32]. The depletion or inhibition of RhoA
typically leads to a decrease in cell migration due to the
inhibition of cell contraction via ROCK and MLC, or may
increase migration by decreasing cell-substratum adhesion

DISCUSSION
Previous studies indicate that factors secreted by
senescent stromal cells impose an aggressive behavior
on neighboring cancer cells. This includes enhanced
proliferation, increased tumor size, loss of cell-cell
contacts, EMT, and invasion [5, 7-11]. Using noninvasive human breast carcinoma cell lines, we observed
that factors secreted by senescent human fibroblasts
additionally promote spontaneous morphological
changes that are accompanied by migration. Elongated
cells had extensions that were morphologically different
from standard lamellipodial and filopodia protrusions,
which are located at the front of the cell in conventional
mesenchymal migration (Table 1) [25]. Rather, they were
long trailing tails. Moreover, live-cell imaging revealed
that, during migration, cells displayed a very thin or no
lamellipodium and no apparent filopodial protrusions
(Figure 1a and 1d). This morphological change provided
cells with the ability to translocate. SASP stimulation
decreases cell contractility, which in turn induces lower
traction forces, inducing a gliding mode of cell migration.

based on the cell type [33]. In our study, depletion of Rho
isoforms and downstream targets in the presence of Sen
CM promotes excessive formation of microtubule richcell extensions. These results, however, indicate that the
presence of cell extensions is necessary but not sufficient
for cell migration, where excessive tails did not further
enhance migration, but either retained or reduced it in
some conditions.
The excessive formation of cell extensions, however,
provided evidence that Rho/ROCK/myosin inhibition may
occur with SASP stimulation alone. This was investigated
with RhoA G-LISA activation assay, which confirmed the
decrease in RhoA-GTP in SASP stimulated cells when
FM and Sen CM were compared. We observed that a 25%
decrease in RhoA activity was sufficient to promote the
phenotypic changes observed with Sen CM exposure.
Not only was RhoA activity decreased, but myosin based
contractility was also diminished with SASP stimulation
The constitutive activation of RhoA, which
stimulates ROCK/myosin activity [16], prevented the
loss of the actin rich cortex and prevented the decrease
in focal adhesions, cell traction and myosin-mediated cell
contractility. We further observed that with constitutive
activation of RhoA, cells failed to promote or maintain
migration in response to SASP. Furthermore, the inhibition
of Rho and downstream targets, ROCK and myosin II
recapitulate similar migratory and morphological changes
as seen with SASP stimulation. Inhibition of Rho alone,
which prevents ROCK/ myosin II activity, also displayed
a similar decrease focal adhesions and cell contractility
as SASP stimulation. Rho inhibited cells also displayed
similar polarization and microtubule organization when
compared to SASP stimulated cells, with microtubule
rich bundles at the cell tails and aligned directionality
of EB1 comets in the polarized direction of the cell. We
demonstrate that RhoA-GTP inhibition is both necessary
and sufficient to initiate and maintain morphological and
migratory changes in response to SASP stimulation.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

It is possible that SASP promotes the breakdown
of the actin-rich cortex, via RhoA/ROCK inhibition,
enabling microtubule expansion and bundling, whereby
promoting the formation of cell tails. Although the
overall cell morphology seems to play an integral role
in SASP-induced cell migration, cells still require
F-actin and microtubule assembly and dynamics
to translocate significantly. However, in contrast to
conventional mesenchymal migration, SASP stimulation
promoted enhanced cell migration via contractility and
focal adhesion inhibition. This may suggest a possible
gliding mechanism (Table 1), where SASP-induced
migration may be promoted in part by decreasing cellsubstratum adhesion [33]. This behavior is similar to
that of neutrophils, which display a rapid migratory
phenotype while lacking focal adhesions [33]. These
results collectively suggest the crosstalk of actin and
microtubules in the promotion of SASP-induced migratory
and morphological changes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
T47D and MCF 7 cells (ATCC) were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC) and DMEM respectively
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone
Standard) and 1% (v/v) Penicillin/ streptomycin (Sigma).
Cells were passaged every 3-4 days for a maximum of
10 passages. Wi-38, BJ and IMR-90 cells (ATCC) were
cultured in Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM;
ATCC) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone Standard) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin
(Sigma). Cells were passaged every 2-3 days. Human
fibroblasts were rendered senescent by treatment with
50 µM bleomycin sulfate (Enzo Life Sciences) for 4 h
and allowed to recover for 8 days. Cells were verified

Oncotarget

to be senescent via Ki-67 immunostaning and a count of
population doublings over a period of 4 days. All cells
were maintained at 37oC and 5% CO2 in a humidified
environment during culture and imaging. T47D cells were
seeded unto tissue culture dishes and allowed to adhere
and spread for a 24h. Cells were then washed 3x with PBS
and incubated with EMEM based FM or CM.

for 10 min. Cells were blocked at room temperature for 1 h
in 1% BSA (Sigma). Subsequently, cells were incubated in
primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies
used included: Rb. Anti-Ki-67 (1:50; ab16667 Abcam),
Ms. Anti-Tubulin (1:1000; ab Abcam), Ms. Anti-Vinculin
(1:400; Sigma). Cells were then incubated with either
Alexa 568 conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies, Hoeccht 33342 and phalloidin for
1h at room temperature, after which cells were washed
with PBS. Fluorescent images were collected after 48 h
exposure to FM or CM conditions. Cells were imaged
using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope using a ×60 waterimmersion lens.

Drug treatments
The microtubule destabilizer nocodazole (Sigma),
the microtubule stabilizer taxol (also known as paclitaxel;
Invitrogen), the F-actin disassembly drug latrunculin B
(Sigma), the non-muscle myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin
(Sigma), the ROCK inihibitor, Y27632 (Sigma), the
Rho inhibitor CT04 (Cytoskeleton Inc.), and the Rho
activator CN03 (Cytoskeleton Inc.) were diluted from
stock using culture medium. Nocodazole was used at
a final concentration of 0.5 µg/ml; taxol was used at a
final concentration of 1 µM. Latrunculin B was used at
a final concentration of 250 nM; blebbistatin was used
at a final concentration of 25 mM; Y27632 was used
at a final concentration of 15 mM; CT04 was used at a
final concentration of 2 µg/ml; CN03 was used at a final
concentration of 1 µg/ml.

Actin-rich edges
The boundaries of randomly selected cells stained
for F-actin were traced using NIS-Elements image analysis
software (Nikon). The percent of actin rich edges were
calculated by dividing the length of the cell containing a
dense F-actin network by the total circumference of the
cell [35].

RhoA activation and immunoblotting
T47D cells were plated and incubated with FM or
CM for 48 h. RhoA G-LISA kit from Cytoskeleton Inc.
was used to assess RhoA activity according to instructions.
Total RhoA blots utilized the same lysates used in the
G-LISA assay. Proteins were resolved on 12% precast
polyacrylamide (Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with RbAnti RhoA antibody (Cell Signaling) followed by Rabbit
HRP antibody (Cell Signalling). Immunoblots were
visualized with ECL clarity and Image lab (Bio-Rad).
Densitometry measurements were performed with Image
Lab software (Bio-Rad).

Conditioned medium and Elisa assay
Conditioned medium (CM) from human fibroblasts
was prepared by washing cells 3x with PBS and incubating
cells with serum-free EMEM for a period of 24 h. Elisa
kits from R&D Systems were used to detect IL-6 (D6050)
and IL-8 (D8000C) according to instructions.

Cell tracking
Cells were exposed to FM or CM conditions for
24h before live cell experiments. Cells were imaged with
a Nikon TE2000 microscope with a phase contrast 10x
objective every 15 min for 36 h. Cells were tracked using
Metamorph (Molecular Devises Corp) software to track
the dependent centroids of individual cells. Individual
cells were tracked using the Metamorph imaging software
(Molecular Devices). A custom MATLAB program
(MathWorks) calculated the MSD for each cell using the x
and y coordinates of the cell centroid using the following
equation: MSD = < [x(t+Δt)-x(t)]2+[y(t+Δt)-y(t)]2 > [34].

Fourier transform traction microscopy
An elastic gel block (Young’s modulus ~1300
Pa, Poisson’s ratio 0.48) was made of acrylamide (2%),
bis-acrylamide (0.25%) and red fluorescent latex beads
(diameter 0.2 μm, 1:100 dilution by volume). A droplet
of the solution was added to an activated glass-bottom
MatTek (P35G-0-14-C) dish, covered with a circular
coverslip (12mm in diameter), and left to polymerize
(upside down) for 45 min. After polymerization, the
coverslip was removed and the surface of gel block was
coated with type I collagen (0.2 mg/ml in PBS) using
photo-reactive crosslinker, Sulfo-SANPAH (Pierce).
Gels were typically 50-70 μm thick. T47D cells were
plated onto polyacrylamide gels and allowed to spread
and stabilize for 24h. FM and CM were then added for
24h. Phase-contrast images of the cells and fluorescent

Immunofluorescence

T47D cells were Trypsinized and resuspended in
EMEM serum free media. Cells were mixed with EMEM
sf and methacott at a (3:1) mixture to obtain a final cell
concentration of 100k/ml. 100 µl of medium/methacott
mixture was added to each well of a 96-well round bottom
non-adhesive dish. Cells were then spun at 1500 rpm for
20 min and stored in a 37-degrees incubator for four days
to allow spheroids to form. Medium was then removed
and 1mg/ml collagen I containing FM or Sen CM was
then added on top of spheroids and allowed to gel for 1 hr
at 37 degrees. 200 µl of FM or Sen CM was then added
on top of gel. Cells were imaged 24 h later. Maximum
radial distance was measured by determining the spheroid
center and measuring the distance traveled by the maximal
displaced cell. These values are normalized to the initial
spheroid conditions (Day 0)
