Effects of Sorafenib Dose on Acquired Reversible
Resistance and Toxicity in Hepatocellular
Carcinoma

Abstract
Acquired evasive resistance is a major limitation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib. Recent ﬁndings suggest that resistance to
sorafenib may have a reversible phenotype. In addition, loss of
responsiveness has been proposed to be due to a gradual decrease
in sorafenib plasma levels in patients. Here, the possible mechanisms underlying reversible sorafenib resistance were investigated
using a Hep3B-hCG orthotopic human xenograft model of locally
advanced HCC. Tissue and plasma sorafenib and metabolite
levels, downstream antitumor targets, and toxicity were assessed
during standard and dose-escalated sorafenib treatment. Drug
levels were found to decline signiﬁcantly over time in mice treated
with 30 mg/kg sorafenib, coinciding with the onset of resistance
but a greater magnitude of change was observed in tissues com-

Introduction
The oral antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib remains the only approved systemic treatment for advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib is an inhibitor of Raf
serine/threonine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases associated
with VEGFR2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR)-b, Flt-3, and c-Kit (1) and other signaling pathways,
including STAT3 (2). In two randomized phase III trials in
advanced HCC patients, sorafenib treatment improved the time
to progression and extended overall survival by 2.8 (3) and 2.3
months (4) compared with placebo. These beneﬁts are unfortunately modest, with upfront (innate/intrinsic) and acquired (evasive/secondary) drug resistance being major contributing factors.
Toxicity is also an issue, leading to a high rate of dose reductions
and treatment interruptions in patients (5, 6).
Proposed mechanisms for resistance, based primarily on preclinical studies, are diverse and numerous. Typically the host

pared with plasma. Skin rash also correlated with drug levels and
tended to decrease in severity over time. Drug level changes
appeared to be partially tumor dependent involving induction
of tumoral CYP3A4 metabolism, with host pretreatment alone
unable to generate resistance. Escalation from 30 to 60 mg/kg
sorafenib improved antitumor efﬁcacy but worsened survival due
to excessive body weight loss. Microvessel density was inhibited
by sorafenib treatment but remained suppressed over time and
dose increase. In conclusion, tumor CYP3A4 induction by sorafenib is a novel mechanism to account for variability in systemic
drug levels; however, declining systemic sorafenib levels may only
be a minor resistance mechanism. Escalating the dose may be an
effective treatment strategy, provided toxicity can be controlled.

tumor microenvironment has been shown to be involved in an
adaptive or evasive response to antiangiogenic treatment leading,
for instance, to reinduction of tumor vascularization and adaptation or escape from tumor hypoxia (7). Cancer cells intrinsically
may also drive resistance, particularly in HCC (8).
There has also been the suggestion that "pharmacokinetic
resistance" could develop to TKIs (9, 10). Standard doses of
oral sorafenib lead to high (50%) interindividual variability
in drug exposure (11–13), suggesting that some patients may
be underdosed. The absence of certain toxicities that are associated with improved clinical outcomes [e.g., hand–foot skin
reaction (HSFR); refs. 14, 15] may also indicate underexposure
and underdosing (16, 17). Inadequate target inhibition and
tumor regrowth could result, appearing as intrinsic resistance.
In addition, sorafenib plasma levels have been shown to
decline over time. In a study of 15 patients with HCC, sorafenib
exposure was found to decrease signiﬁcantly from 1 month of
treatment (AUC 60.3 mgh/L) to the time of disease progression
(33.2 mgh/L; P ¼ 0.007; ref. 10). This trend was later reported
in other malignancies (12, 18, 19). Such drug level changes
could lead to reduced toxicities and acquired resistance and
managed simply by long-term dosage adjustments. The cause of
declining sorafenib exposure is unknown.
In patients, resistance to TKIs occasionally presents as a reversible rather than permanent phenotype (20). Patients with renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) who had progressed on/acquired resistance to sorafenib (21) or sunitinib (22) have been reported
to respond to rechallenge with the same agents. Similarly, it
has been argued that clinical trials evaluating the strategy of
switching to another antiangiogenic TKI after "resistance" has
developed should contain an arm evaluating continuation of

Sorafenib Levels and Resistance in HCC

treatment with the same TKI since this strategy is often efﬁcacious
(23). Reversible sorafenib resistance has been modeled preclinically in HCC using mice bearing intrahepatic human xenografts of Hep3B-hCG cells (24). These mice demonstrate initial
marked sensitivity to sorafenib that is followed by tumor
rebound after 1 month, based on levels of the secreted urinary
protein tumor biomarker bhCG (b human chorionic gonadotropic hormone) and tumor weight changes (24). Once ostensibly resistant tumor cells were adapted to culture and reimplanted into new hosts, the resultant tumors were completely
resensitized to retreatment (24). Reversible resistance may be a
common but underappreciated phenomenon but how it relates
to other resistance mechanisms is unclear.
Using the Hep3B-hCG model of HCC, mechanisms underlying
reversible resistance to sorafenib were investigated. Similar to
patients, sorafenib plasma levels were found to gradually
decline—an effect that was found to be partially tumor dependent. Dose escalation inhibited tumor growth, but was unable to
prevent further tumor progression and was too toxic without
incorporation of therapy breaks. This study supports the involvement of declining sorafenib plasma levels as a minor or contributing resistance mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Orthotopic mouse model
Athymic nude mice (nu/nu; Harlan) were used for experiments
assessing sorafenib concentrations. CB17 SCID mice (Charles
River) were used for sorafenib "preconditioning" and in-house
bred yellow ﬂuorescent protein expressing CB17 SCID mice were
used for transfer of resistant phenotype experiments (breeding
pairs a gift from Dr. Janusz Rak, McGill University, Montreal,
Quebec) . Mice were male ages 6 to 8 weeks. Animal procedures
were in accordance with institutional animal care and maintenance guidelines.
The Hep3B-hCG model of HCC was described previously (25).
Brieﬂy, HCCs were established by injecting 1 to 2  106 Hep3BhCG cells/10 mL volume into the left liver lobe of anesthetized
mice (25). Individual mouse urine bhCG levels (henceforth,
"hCG") normalized to creatinine served as a noninvasive surrogate biomarker for tumor burden (25). The Hep3B-hCG cell line
was authenticated by STR DNA analysis (Genetica DNA Laboratories) and was found to be Mycoplasma free (Lonza).
Sorafenib dosing and toxicity monitoring
Sorafenib tosylate was obtained from Bayer with the assistance
of Dr. Dennis Healy and was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Unless otherwise indicated, oral
gavage treatment of 30 mg/kg sorafenib or vehicle control began
at hCG > 0 (tumor diameter 1–2 mm). Tumor response was
deﬁned as hCG stabilization (decline from prior assessment
and/or hCG < 200 mIU/mg) and a progression deﬁned as
hCG > 200 mIU/mg. In cases where mice progressed early,
treatment was continued to conﬁrm tumor response. Dose was
switched to 60 mg/kg on treatment day 29 approximating the
average time of tumor progression.
Therapy was temporarily stopped at 10% average body weight
loss in SCID mice and reinitiated following recovery to 5% (3–5
days of therapy breaks) mimicking the way toxicity is frequently
managed clinically (5). For sorafenib preconditioning, tumor-free
SCID mice were treated with sorafenib or vehicle as per tumorbearing mice for 45 or 65 days, were given a 2-day washout period

www.aacrjournals.org

then were orthotopically implanted with parental Hep3B-hCG
cells and randomized. After 5 days of surgery recovery, treatment
was resumed according to the schedule of the group experiencing
the most toxicity. Continuous daily dosing was possible for
athymic nu/nu mice, which tolerate TKIs better than SCID mice
(24). Skin toxicity was monitored biweekly by brieﬂy anesthetizing and photographing nu/nu mice. Rash was graded as "rash,"
"no rash," or "resolved rash." Resolved rash appeared as clear skin
or rashes that diminished signiﬁcantly in area (>95%) and
redness from prior assessment.
Plasma and tissue sampling
Flash-frozen tumor and heparin-plasma samples (by cardiac
puncture) were initially obtained 24 hours after dosing (ctrough).
In subsequent experiments, mice were fasted for 3 hours, dosed,
and heparin-plasma was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus 3
hours later to achieve maximal drug/metabolite concentrations
(tmax 1–3 hours in mice; refs. 26, 27). Plasma samples were taken
from different tumor-free and HCC mice 2 weeks pretreatment,
days 1, 4, 7, and 11. Serial biweekly samples were obtained from a
different set of mice for weeks 2þ. Weighed ﬂash-frozen liver and
tumor and formalin-ﬁxed tumor samples were obtained at sacriﬁce (3 hours after dosing) on day 14 (sensitive) and at endpoint
(control, resistance, and dose-escalation phases). Plasma or
homogenized tissue samples (100 mL volume) were analyzed by
HPLC tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to determine
sorafenib and estimate N-oxide metabolite levels as previously
described (28, 29).
Protein analysis
Protein expression in liver and tumor lysates was analyzed by
Western blot analysis (40 mg protein/well) using the following
antibodies: phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705; 4113), STAT3 (4904),
mouse/human CYP3A4 (13384), phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204;
4376), ERK (4696; all Cell Signaling Technology), and b-actin
(A5441; Sigma-Aldrich).
IHC
Formalin ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tumor sections were
immunostained using the following reagents: For microvessel
density (MVD; CD34þ and CD31þ vessels), 1:150 CD34 (LSC47878; LifeSpan Biosciences), 1:100 CD31 (sc-1506; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), Cy3- and Alexa488-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) and DAPI (Invitrogen);
for cell proliferation (human Ki-67), 1:1,000 Ki-67 antibody
(VP-K451; Vector Laboratories), LSABþ and DABþ kits (Dako),
and hematoxylin (Surgipath). Approximately 20 images/section
were obtained (n ¼ 4–9/group) at 100 (Ki-67) or 200 (MVD).
CD34þ or CD31þ microvessel counts and Ki-67 stain were normalized to nuclear stain using ImageJ (v.1.46r) software.
Statistical analysis
Experimental group differences were evaluated by the Student t
test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons. The effects of tumor presence and time on drug
concentrations were assessed by two-way ANOVA. Correlations
between hCG and drug concentrations were determined by linear
regression. Survival was evaluated by log-rank test using GraphPad Prism (v.4.00). Data are presented as the mean and SEM.
Signiﬁcance level was set at P ¼ 0.05.

Plasma sorafenib declines over time
Variants from in vivo sorafenib (30 mg/kg)-resistant Hep3BhCG tumors were ﬁrst assessed in vitro for resistant properties;
however, no indication of resistance was observed (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1E). Because the resistant phenotype was
also lost by transferring resistant tumor fragments or chronically sorafenib-exposed variants into tumor-na€ve hosts, host
treatment appeared important for resistance (Supplementary
Fig. S1F and S1G and unpublished results). Host-wide pharmacokinetic changes are associated with disease progression in
patients (10, 12, 18, 19), therefore this was investigated as a
mediator of the reversible sorafenib-resistant phenotype in
mice.
Drug levels in tumor and plasma samples were analyzed
from athymic nu/nu mice bearing Hep3B-hCG xenografts treated daily with 30 mg/kg sorafenib. Samples were obtained from
sensitive (treatment day 13, n ¼ 6), preprogression (day 33, n ¼
6), and acquired resistant mice (days 47–88, n ¼ 8; Fig. 1A).
Trough (ctrough, 24 hours) measurements were taken to estimate
steady state levels (shown to correlate with TKI treatment
outcome; refs. 30, 31), and to overcome the obstacle of obtaining multiple timed plasma samples. As per patients with HCC
(10), a signiﬁcant reduction in plasma sorafenib concentration
was observed in mice that had acquired resistance relative to
responsive mice (70.6% decline, P < 0.05; ANOVA P ¼
0.0204; Fig. 1B). Tumor sorafenib levels tended to decline but

this was not statistically signiﬁcant (ANOVA P ¼ 0.309; Fig.
1C). Similar trends were also observed in 4 mice that progressed without a prolonged initial response to sorafenib
(plasma P ¼ 0.0451; tumor P ¼ 0.142; Supplementary Fig.
S2A and S2B). Overall, declining systemic drug levels correlated
with resistance in mice with HCC.
The presence of tumor intensiﬁes declining sorafenib levels
Both host and tumor factors could conceivably contribute to
the observed decline in sorafenib. In the host, 5% of sorafenib
is oxidated by hepatic p450 enzyme CYP3A4 (32) and 15%
glucuronidated by UGT1A9 (33) contributing to fecal and
urinary elimination, respectively. The oxidated N-oxide metabolite is pharmacologically active but more hydrophobic than
the parent compound and represents the dominant circulating
metabolite in humans (9%–16% of total sorafenib; ref. 33) and
pharmacologic induction of CYP3A4 has been shown to
decrease systemic sorafenib concentrations (32, 34). In contrast, drug efﬂux transporters P-glycoprotein and ABCG2 are
thought to play minor roles in sorafenib pharmacokinetics (35,
36). In the tumor, drugs may accumulate in cancer cells (such as
in acidic lysosomes for sunitinib; ref. 9) or cancer cells may
themselves highly express drug metabolizing enzymes (37)
thereby potentially inﬂuencing exposure levels. Thus, concentrations of sorafenib and its major metabolite were determined
in the presence and absence of tumor to explore the mechanism
of sorafenib decline.

Tumor-free and Hep3B-hCG tumor-bearing (HCC) mice
were treated daily with sorafenib (30 mg/kg) and after 29 days
half of mice were switched to 60 mg/kg, and plasma was
sampled 3 hours after dosing to maximize drug concentrations.
Peak plasma sorafenib was achieved days 4 to 7 in mice treated
with 30 mg/kg sorafenib (Fig. 2A), which then declined in both
HCC (R2 ¼ 0.723, P ¼ 0.0075) and tumor-free mice (R2 ¼
0.813, P ¼ 0.0055); however, total sorafenib levels tended to be
higher in tumor-free mouse plasma (Fig. 2B). Both time (P <

associated with plasma levels by two-way ANOVA. Tumor
presence also signiﬁcantly affected %N-oxide levels (P ¼

in tumor-bearing mice only, but thereafter remained marginally higher than in tumor-free mice. The decline in sorafenib

19.4% decline was observed in tumor-free livers (P ¼ 0.232; Fig.
2C). Tissue levels of %sorafenib N-oxide did not signiﬁcantly
change (P > 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S3A).
The host effect on resistance is minimal
To determine the extent to which host-induced changes contributed to resistance, tumor-free SCID mice were preconditioned
with sorafenib for 45 or 65 days before tumor implantation,
corresponding to early and late onset of resistance (Supplementary Fig. S3B). SCID mice were given brief toxicity-associated
therapy breaks allowing extended treatment times (24). Sorafenib
preconditioning worsened weight loss but did not accelerate the
onset of resistance relative to vehicle preconditioning (Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Fig. S3C). Thus, the presence of HCC tumor
worsened the gradual decline in sorafenib but the host effect
alone appeared minimal as host treatment was insufﬁcient to
generate resistance.

Incidence of mouse skin toxicity parallels decline of sorafenib
levels
Skin toxicities, including rash and HSFR, are the most commonly reported adverse events in sorafenib-treated patients (5).
Skin toxicity has been correlated with drug exposures (17, 38) and
improved clinical outcomes (14, 39) but has paradoxically been
reported to decrease in severity over time (12, 40, 41). Seventyfour percent of HCC (n ¼ 43) and 75% of tumor-free mice (n ¼
20) developed a nonirritated red skin on the ventral skin surface,
ranging from small spots to nearly the entire surface (Fig. 2E).
Rash was a treatment effect since stopping therapy caused complete rash resolution (and weight gain) in 7 of 7 mice within 1 to 2
weeks (results not shown). While weight loss was slow and
progressive in sorafenib (30 mg/kg) treated mice, rash initially
developed weeks 2 to 6 but tended to resolve beginning week 4
(Fig. 2F). Forty-two percent of HCC mice treated >6 weeks (n ¼
12) and 44% tumor-free mice (n ¼ 9) showed rash improvement.
Although delayed in time, this result may reﬂect declining tissue
drug levels.
Tumor-mediated sorafenib metabolism correlates with
declining drug levels
The effect of the tumor on drug levels was further explored.
Negative correlations were observed between sorafenib concentrations and tumor burden/hCG. This relationship was
strongest in the tumor (R2 ¼ 0.248, P ¼ 0.0419) and
approached signiﬁcance in the liver (R2 ¼ 0.1507, P ¼
0.0820) and the plasma (R2 ¼ 0.0498, P ¼ 0.074; Fig. 3A).
Contrastingly, plasma %N-oxide correlated positively with

sorafenib levels are associated with

hCG (R2 ¼ 0.280, P < 0.0001). Thus, local tumor drug levels
and plasma %N-oxide associated well with the degree of tumor
burden, but associations with plasma drug concentrations and
tumor responses were weak.
Tumor and liver lysates were analyzed to determine expression levels of CYP3A4 enzyme. CYP3A4 protein levels were
found to increase during sorafenib treatment in tumors (individual and pooled lysates) compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3B and C) and was further induced in dose-escalated
tumors. In contrast, CYP3A4 remained stable in HCC and
tumor-free livers (Fig. 3C). Although dose escalation increased
plasma sorafenib concentrations (Fig. 3D), it also induced %Noxide metabolite, which appeared to relate to CYP3A4 levels
(Fig. 3E). Thus, autoinduction of sorafenib metabolism may
explain, at least in part, the tumor's contribution to systemic
sorafenib level decline.
Sorafenib dose escalation inhibits tumor growth at the expense
of increased toxicity
When the dose of sorafenib was doubled to 60 mg/kg on day 29
(beginning at the time of ctrough decline Fig. 1B and average hCG
progression), plasma levels increased by only 23.6% from preescalation levels. This escalation strategy appeared effective in
correcting drug level decline since plasma concentrations were
restored to early timepoints (Fig. 3D) and concentrations significantly increased in the livers (P ¼ 0.00895) and tumors (P ¼
0.0387) of HCC mice (Fig. 4A; though this did not correspond
with signiﬁcant %N-oxide increases except in tumor-free livers;
Supplementary Fig. S4A).

Dose escalation was evaluated for its ability to treat or prevent
resistant disease. By day 29, progressive disease was achieved in 17
of 43 mice, a difference that appeared weakly (nonsigniﬁcantly) to
lower tissue sorafenib levels (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C).
In all mice, dose escalation inhibited hCG (Fig. 4B) in addition to
tumor plus liver mass (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S4D). This
strategy was not, however, effective in reversing resistance since
disease continued to progress at a rate similar to nonescalated
mice. Dose escalation also resulted in excessive weight loss (Fig.
4C), which was the primary reason for termination (20% weight
loss endpoint), leading to signiﬁcantly decreased median survival
(log rank P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 4D). Tumor presence had no signiﬁcant
impact on weight loss or survival (P > 0.05; Supplementary Fig.
S4E–S4G); therefore, drug toxicity was a critical factor in survival.
Dose escalation worsened skin rash by week 6, then 58% of HCC
mice (n ¼ 12) and 50% of tumor-free mice (n ¼ 8) experienced
rash improvement (Fig. 4E).
Inhibition of angiogenesis is not associated with drug level
changes
The possibility that circulating drug concentrations were

investigated. No inhibition in Raf (ERK), VEGFR2, or PDGFRb
signaling by sorafenib treatment was detected in tumor lysates
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Only P-STAT3 was inhibited by
initial sorafenib treatment, which subsequently increased during
resistance in livers from both HCC and tumor-free mice (Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Fig. S5C), potentially related to changes in
local sorafenib levels. Similar ﬁndings were observed in tumors
although initial P-STAT3 inhibition by sorafenib treatment was not
observed. Escalation to 60 mg/kg sorafenib had little effect on
P-STAT3 despite increases in tissue drug concentrations (Fig. 5A).
Of those tested, the predominant antitumor mechanism for
sorafenib treatment appeared to be antiangiogenesis. Sorafenibtreated tumors were less hemorrhagic than controls, but doseescalated tumors were smaller and appeared more white/necrotic
(Fig. 5B). Sorafenib treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited microvessel
density (P < 0.001 vs. controls, ANOVA P < 0.0001), but during
resistance there was no evidence of resumption of angiogenesis.
Likewise, hypoxia-responsive carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) protein remained elevated throughout treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S5D). In contrast, tumor cell proliferation was not signiﬁcantly affected by treatment (ANOVA P ¼ 0.082; Fig. 5C), except
for minor inhibition during dose escalation (t test, P ¼ 0.0135 vs.

Effects of sorafenib on cell signaling and antitumor activity. A, sorafenib treatment inhibited phosphorylation of downstream target STAT3 (P-STAT3)
in livers (pooled lysates). P-STAT3 increased in tumors and livers of resistance phase HCC and tumor-free mice, but remained high in dose-escalated tissues,
indicating some correlation with local drug levels. B, ﬁxed tumor cross-sections show hemorrhagic control tumors and increasingly pale treated tumors. Dose
escalated tumors were small and appeared necrotic/white. C, tumor cell proliferation (human Ki-67 immunostaining) did not signiﬁcantly change during
treatment (ANOVA, P ¼ 0.082) but tended to decrease during dose escalation (t test, P ¼ 0.0135 vs. resistant). Tumor microvessel density [CD31 (green) and

resistance). Altogether, systemic drug levels appeared sufﬁcient
for inhibiting angiogenesis therefore factors other than an
increase in microvessel density must be responsible for causing
HCC tumor progression.

Discussion
In recent clinical studies, sorafenib exposure was reported to
decline by up to 50% at the time of disease progression in small
groups of patients with HCC (10), melanoma (19), and other
solid tumors (12, 18). A similar observation has been made in
GIST patients treated with the TKI imatinib (42), but as with
sorafenib, the underlying causes of it are unknown. Here, clinical
observations were conﬁrmed in mice bearing HCC xenografts
and a possible mechanism was identiﬁed. However, the involvement of this phenomenon in reversible resistance appears
complex.
Mechanism of reduced drug exposure over time
In patients, pharmacologic induction of CYP3A4 by anti-epileptic drugs or rifampin signiﬁcantly decreased sorafenib exposure (32, 34), suggesting a key role for this metabolic pathway.
CYP3A4 inhibition by ketoconazole or midazolam had little
effect on exposure except for reducing metabolite levels (43,
44), which is expected given that only 5% of an oral dose is
metabolized by CYP3A4 (32). Autoinduction of drug metabolism
in the tumor has largely been an underappreciated contributor to

2516 Cancer Res; 75(12) June 15, 2015

resistance (37). In vivo tumor induction of CYP3A4 by sorafenib
was found to be a possible contributor to declining drug levels for
the ﬁrst time. This result is consistent with ﬁndings that TKIs
geﬁtinib and sunitinib could induce expression of p450 enzyme
CYP1A1 in cancer cell lines (45, 46), which has not yet been
shown for sorafenib. Despite the key role for hepatic metabolism,
no liver induction of CYP3A4 was observed during treatment, in
agreement with prior observations (26, 27).
Tumoral CYP3A4 induction does not explain the weaker sorafenib decline in tumor-free mice. It is possible that additional
factors, such as drug-binding plasma proteins levels, decreased
intestinal absorption, and involvement of other metabolic pathways (e.g., UGT1A9) contribute to sorafenib level changes in the
host and in patients. Because of the high tumor:body mass ratio of
mice in xenograft studies, the importance of a tumor-dependent
mechanism may have been exaggerated here, further highlighting
the need for follow-up studies.
The sorafenib dose used here (30 mg/kg) is considered low
following conversion to a human equivalent dose (47). Plasma
concentrations (20,000 ng/mL) were in the range of mouse
studies (26) but higher than in patients (<10,000 ng/mL with
400 mg twice daily dosing; ref. 11). In humans, the N-oxidation
pathway is more pronounced than in mice (27), which is validated
by the N-oxide levels observed here (1%–3% vs. 9%–16% in
humans; ref. 33). Although higher %N-oxide might be expected
from CYP3A4 induction, it cannot be ruled out that generated
metabolite was cleared too rapidly for direct quantiﬁcation.

Sorafenib Levels and Resistance in HCC

Alternatively, the observed metabolite levels may indicate a minor
impact of the tumor on drug levels. Indeed P-STAT3 and rash
patterns (potential pharmacodynamic markers) were similar
regardless of tumor presence, but the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be complex.
Dose escalation as a therapeutic strategy
In selected populations of RCC and HCC patients, slowly
ramping up the dose of sorafenib (41) or increasing the dose at
progression (48, 49) has demonstrated tolerability and antitumor
activity. Dose escalating may also serve to reestablish adequate
exposure levels (10, 12, 18, 19). Here, dose was doubled concurrently for all mice regardless of weight loss status. This did not
prove to be effective: antitumor activity increased but tolerability
was poor. Lower-than-predicted plasma drug levels also occurred
as is common in dose-escalated patients, which may indicate
saturated drug absorption (11, 13) or poor drug solubility at
higher doses (27).
On the basis of the data presented here, therapeutic plasma
drug monitoring could underrepresent drug levels changes within
the tissues, which could mean missed opportunities to optimize
the dosage. Dose escalating according to toxicity is an alternative.
For the ﬁrst time shown here, skin rash in mice recapitulated
observations of rash and HSFR in TKI-treated patients. Rash
developed at a high rate for up to 6 weeks correlating with early
treatment response (14, 15) and tended to improve in approximately 50% of cases mimicking the reported decreasing severity
of skin toxicity (12, 40, 41). Rash improvement may therefore be
directly related to declining drug levels as suggested by correlations with AUC in patients (12, 19). The uncoupling between
patterns of weight loss and rash appears consistent with clinical
ﬁndings and may relate to higher unabsorbed drug concentrations
in the gut (19). To manage excessive weight loss, dose interruptions should be incorporated, which may also help resensitize the
tumor (20). Optimized strategies that combine dose increases
with brief therapy breaks may hold at least some antitumor
activity while prolonging survival. Extensions in PFS and OS have
been achieved in a retrospective study using a similar strategy with
sunitinib in RCC (50).
Declining sorafenib levels as a resistance mechanism
At ﬁrst glance, systemic drug level changes appear to correlate
with resistance and hence provide a possible mechanism for the
reversible resistant phenotype that cannot be propagated to new
hosts (24). Tissue sorafenib levels related to tumor progression
and P-STAT signaling. Interaction between the host and tumor
cells was also found to be critical for resistance. However, the lack
of microvessel density change during treatment suggests that drug
levels remained sufﬁcient for long-term angiogenesis inhibition,
assuming that microvessel density is directly correlated to the

antitumor effect. Thus, declining drug levels could be a minor or a
contributing factor to resistance. Likewise, dose escalation slowed
tumor growth but did not directly prevent tumor progression or
effectively treat resistant disease. This might explain why the
beneﬁts of sorafenib dose escalation are often transient (18, 41).
In conclusion, sorafenib levels declined over time in mice, but
its role in resistance is unclear. Escalating the dose may be an
effective strategy; however, more tolerable regimens are needed,
particularly for patients with HCC with impaired liver function. A
relationship was also observed between skin rash in "nude" mice
and drug levels. Given the frequency of rash as a side effect of
many biologic anticancer agents, these results could be extended
to study the impact of rash as a potential biomarker of drug
efﬁcacy. Although drug resistance remains a complex issue, individualizing treatment regimens with toxicity-guided approaches
has potential to enhance the activity of currently available TKIs for
cancer treatment.
