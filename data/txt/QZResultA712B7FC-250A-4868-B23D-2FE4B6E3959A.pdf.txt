Abstract
MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) was reported to be overexpressed and contributes to invasion and gemcitabine
resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether
miR-21 expression was associated with the overall survival (OS) of PDAC patients treated with gemcitabine
and to provide mechanistic insights for new therapeutic targets. miR-21 expression was evaluated in cells
(including 7 PDAC cell lines, 7 primary cultures, fibroblasts, and a normal pancreatic ductal cell line) and
tissues (neoplastic specimens from 81 PDAC patients and normal ductal samples) isolated by laser microdissection. The role of miR-21 on the pharmacologic effects of gemcitabine was studied with a specific miR-21
precursor (pre-miR-21). Patients with high miR-21 expression had a significantly shorter OS both in the metastatic and in the adjuvant setting. Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of miR-21. miR-21
expression in primary cultures correlated with expression in their respective tissues and with gemcitabine
resistance. Pre-miR-21 transfection significantly decreased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induction
by gemcitabine, whereas matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth
factor expression were upregulated. Addition of inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin resulted in decrease of phospho-Akt and prevented pre-miR-21–induced resistance to the
proapoptotic effects of gemcitabine. miR-21 expression correlated with outcome in PDAC patients treated
with gemcitabine. Modulation of apoptosis, Akt phosphorylation, and expression of genes involved in invasive behavior may contribute to the role of miR-21 in gemcitabine chemoresistance and to the rational
development of new targeted combinations. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4528–38. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth
leading cause of cancer-related death, with only 3% of
patients alive 5 years after diagnosis (1). The main reasons
for this grim prognosis include early metastatic spread,
high local recurrence rate, and multifactorial resistance to
treatments (2).
In 85% of patients, PDAC is detected at advanced stages,
characterized by infiltration of proximal lymph nodes and

vascular structures, as well as metastasis to liver/peritoneum.
The first-line agent gemcitabine produced some clinical
benefit in the advanced setting but yields a limited disease
control, with <15% of patients progression-free at 6 months
from diagnosis (2, 3). Although several attempts have been
made to increase the survival using combinations of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, only a marginal success was
achieved with gemcitabine combined with capecitabine or
erlotinib, and with a four-drug regimen (4–6). According to
the results of CONKO-001 and ESPAC-3 trials (7, 8), gemcitabine also increased the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the adjuvant setting. However, the most
effective adjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear, and the
5-year survival in patients undergoing resection still hovers
between 10% and 20% (1).
Therefore, the identification of predictive factors for gemcitabine activity seems to be critical for maximizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing useless treatment in PDAC.
Pharmacogenetic studies showed correlations of polymorphisms or expression of DNA repair enzymes and nucleoside
transporters with outcome in gemcitabine-treated patients
(9, 10). However, prognosis of patients harboring favorable
genotypes or expression levels for these candidate biomarkers

miR-21 and Gemcitabine Resistance in Pancreatic Cancer

is still poor and novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches
are warranted.
Global genomic analysis showed that PDAC resulted from
aberrations of genes that function through a relatively small
number of core signaling pathways (11). In addition to yielding insights into pathogenesis, such studies suggest that the
best hope for the development of agents targeting nodal
points in the altered pathways lies in the study of mechanisms involved in gene expression regulation.
Recently, microRNAs (miRNA) have emerged as a critical
class of negative regulators of gene expression through modulation of posttranscriptional activity of multiple target mRNAs
by repression of translation or direct cleavage (12). The role of
miRNAs in control of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis; the location of several miRNA genes at sites of translocation breakpoints or deletions; and their aberrant expression
in many tumors indicated that they can function as tumor suppressors and oncogenes (13). Furthermore, selected miRNAs
may influence response to chemotherapy (14–16).
Expression profiling identified several miRNAs aberrantly
expressed in PDAC, including four miRNAs differentially
expressed in other tumors: miR-155, miR-21, miR-221 and
miR-222 (17). These results were corroborated by other
studies, showing that miR-21 was among the top miRNAs
with increased expression in PDAC (18–20).
miR-21 has been associated with ovarian cancer carcinogenesis (21), and a pivotal role in cancer is suggested by its
widespread deregulation in various solid tumors, such as
glioblastoma, cholangiocarcinoma, papillary thyroid, breast,
esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, colon, prostate, lung,
head and neck, and cervical cancer, as well as in hematologic
malignancies (22). The oncogenic properties of miR-21 are
further supported by functional studies showing that inhibition of miR-21 expression reduced proliferation of several
cancer cells, including breast, hepatocellular, and PDAC cells
(23–25), and generated a proapoptotic response in different
cell lines, including glioblastoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and
PDAC cells (22, 26, 27). In contrast, transfection with miR-21
precursors stimulated invasion, extravasation, and metastasis in in vivo models of glioma, colorectal, and breast cancer
(28–30), as well as in cellular models of PDAC (25).
These data suggested that elevated levels of miR-21 might
be associated with tumor progression, and because miR-21 is
one of the most abundant and easily detectable miRNAs (31),
several studies evaluated its role as a prognostic biomarker.
The expression of miR-21 has been correlated with clinical
stage, lymph node, and distant metastasis as well as with
poor prognosis in glioma, colon, breast, and tongue squamous cell cancers (24, 28, 32–34). High miR-21 expression
was associated with more aggressive pancreatic endocrine
tumors, characterized by increased Ki67 proliferation index
and liver metastasis (35). Furthermore, miR-21 expression
was significantly lower in the eight PDAC that clustered with
the benign pancreas specimens in the study performed by
Bloomston and colleagues (18). In situ hybridization showed
that miR-21 overexpression was strictly localized to PDAC
cells and predictive of shorter survival in node-negative
patients, but this subset of patients was small and no data

were available on treatment (36). In contrast, no correlation
between miR-21 and clinicopathologic findings was observed
using PCR on bulk tissues from 25 PDAC patients, without
information on chemotherapy (25). Therefore, further studies
on a larger number of better-characterized PDAC patients,
using techniques to minimize contamination by surrounding
stroma, such as laser microdissection (LMD), are warranted.
Recent studies also reported significant correlations between miR-21 expression and resistance to anticancer agents
(15, 23, 37). In particular, inhibition of miR-21 increased sensitivity to gemcitabine in cholangiocarcinoma and PDAC
cells (25–27). However, miR-21 did not affect gemcitabineinduced apoptosis in colon cancer cells (38), whereas other
miRNAs, such as miR-200 and let-7, were involved in the
reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in gemcitabineresistant PDAC cells (39).
The aim of the present study was to characterize miR-21
expression in a wide repository of PDAC tissues and cells,
associated with clinical outcome and gemcitabine activity.
We observed a significant correlation between outcome
and miR-21 expression in laser-microdissected tumors from
gemcitabine-treated patients, both in the metastatic and in
the adjuvant setting, as well as a correlation with chemosensitivity in PDAC cells. Further, we characterized several
factors, including modulation of apoptosis, Akt phosphorylation, and expression of PTEN and genes involved in invasive
behavior, which may contribute to miR-21 role in gemcitabine chemoresistance and provide mechanistic insights for
the rational development of new targeted combinations
against PDAC.

Materials and Methods
Clinical study
Patients. From December 2001 to October 2004, a total of
81 patients affected by metastatic (n = 31) or nonmetastatic
(n = 50) PDAC (median age, 63; range, 32–83) and treated
with gemcitabine were enrolled in a retrospective study on
determinants of gemcitabine activity (10). Treatment details
are in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Tissues. RNA was extracted from biopsies and primary
tumors, resected before chemotherapy, using the LMD7000
instrument (Leica Microsystems), as described previously
(40). LMD was also used to obtain cells of epithelium ducts
from 5 normal pancreatic tissues, obtained from the “Organ
Donor Program,” whereas in 10 cases RNA was extracted
from the whole tumor without microdissection. All specimens were obtained according to a protocol approved by
the Local Ethics Committee.
Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR analysis of
miR-21. RNA (10–100 ng) was reverse transcribed and the
resulting cDNA was amplified using the specific Taqman
MicroRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) for miR-21 and
RNU43 (assay ID, 000397 and 001095, respectively). The PCRs
were performed in the 7500HT sequence detection system
(Applied Biosystems), in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions. Specimens were amplified in triplicate with
appropriate nontemplate controls. Amplification data were

normalized to RNU43 expression. Quantification of relative
expression [reported as arbitrary units (a.u.)] was performed
using the ΔCt method. Quantitative PCR data showed a variability coefficient of Ct always lower than 2% of mean values.
In vitro studies
Cells and cytotoxicity studies. Seven PDAC cell lines, the
human pancreatic duct epithelial-like cell line hTERT-HPNE,
and skin fibroblasts Hs27 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection, whereas seven primary PDAC
cultures (LPc006, LPc028, LPc033, LPc067, LPc111, LPc167,
and PP437) were isolated from patients at Pisa Hospital
(40). The cell growth–inhibitory effect of 72-hour gemcitabine exposure was studied as described previously (10).
Quantitative PCR analysis of miR-21. RNA was extracted
according to the Trizol-chloroform protocol, and the miR-21
basal expression as well as its modulation after gemcitabine
treatment using IC50 concentrations were assessed by quantitative PCR, as described above. Data were normalized to RNU43,

and quantification of miR-21 expression compared with
untreated controls was assessed using the ΔΔCt method (10).
miR-21 transfection. The effect of miR-21 on chemosensitivity and apoptosis was evaluated by transfecting the PDAC
cells with pre-miR-21 precursors (pre-miR-21) or antisense
oligonucleotides (anti-miR-21) purchased from Ambion
(assay ID, PM10206 and AM10206, respectively) at 30 nmol/L
final concentration. Cells were plated at 200,000 per well in
3 mL RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
antibiotics. After 24 hours, cells were exposed to 9 μL Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium and mixed for
10 minutes, followed by addition of 3 μL miR-21 precursor/
inhibitor. Cells were also incubated with miRNA-negative
controls and FAM-labeled pre-miR/anti-miR (Ambion). After
24 hours, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 with
10% FBS, without antibiotics. To evaluate the effects on cell
growth, cells were allowed to grow for additional 48 or
72 hours in drug-free medium or treated with gemcitabine, as
described previously (10, 40). To evaluate apoptosis induction

and modulation of cell signaling and invasion, cells were
allowed to grow for additional 48 hours in drug-free medium
or treated with 50 μmol/L gemcitabine, 10 μmol/L LY294002,
and 200 nmol/L rapamycin, alone and in combinations (26),
as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Additional control wells were used for RNA extraction, as described above, whereas the transfection efficiency with
FAM-labeled pre-miR/anti-miR controls was evaluated with
fluorescence microscopy.
Statistics. All experiments were performed in triplicate
and repeated thrice. Data were expressed as mean ± SE
and analyzed by Student's t test or ANOVA followed by the
Tukey's multiple comparison. Comparison of clinical information and miR-21 expression was made using Pearson χ2
test and Wilcoxon test. The relationship between miR-21
expression and outcome was evaluated by stratifying the
patients with respect to the median expression value.
OS was calculated from the date of pathologic diagnosis
(i.e., the date of surgery/biopsy) to the date of death, DFS
was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the
date of first relapse or death in radically resected patients,
and progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time
from the date of diagnosis to the date of progression or death
in metastatic patients. OS, PFS, and DFS curves were constructed using Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were
analyzed using log-rank test. The significant prognostic
variables of OS in univariate analysis were included in multivariate analyses using Cox's proportional hazards model.
Data were analyzed using SPSS v.17 statistical software
(SPSS, Inc.). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Clinical study
miR-21 expression in pancreatic specimens. LMD was
performed on 81 samples from PDAC patients, including 7
tumor specimens from which primary cultures were derived.
LMD was also performed on five specimens from normal
ducts. For each sample, the precision of the focus of the laser
beam allowed to pick up 5,000 cells, with high degree of
accuracy and extremely low risk of contamination (Fig. 1A,
video). miR-21 was detectable in all samples, and Fig. 1A
shows its large variability across the tissues, with median
value of 0.315 a.u. (range, 0.003–18.336). Remarkably, miR-21
expression profile differed significantly between grade 1/2
(n = 33) and grade 3 (n = 35) tumors (P = 0.01, Wilcoxon rank
sum test). In contrast, no difference was detected in miR-21
expression levels according to stage or other clinicopathologic parameters (Table 1).
The mean miR-21 expression of normal pancreatic duct
samples was ∼1,000-fold lower than the levels in microdissected
tumors (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the nonmicrodissected tumor
tissues had a significantly lower expression of miR-21 than
their respective microdissected samples (P = 0.014; Fig. 1A).
miR-21 overexpression correlated with worse outcome
in PDAC patients treated with gemcitabine. Clinical data
were available from 31 patients in the metastatic and 28 in
the adjuvant setting, followed-up until December 31, 2009,

with follow-up ranging from 1.6 to 60.5 months (median,
17.3 mo). Response data are in Supplementary Table S1.
Table 2 summarizes the clinicopathologic characteristics
and their relation with outcome in metastatic patients. The
median PFS and OS were 5.5 and 8.4 months, respectively.
The high miR-21 expression group had a poorer prognosis
than the low expression group. Patients with miR-21 expression above median had a significantly shorter median OS
[6.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 5.5–7.9 mo] compared
with patients with miR-21 expression lower than median
[11.2; 95% CI, 4.5–17.8 mo; hazard ratio (HR), 3.1; 95% CI,
1.4–7.1; P = 0.01]. Similar results were obtained with the
PFS curves of patients with miR-21 expression above median,
with a median of 4.2, compared with 7.8 months in patients
with the lowest miR-21 expression (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1–5.3;

P = 0.03). The OS and PFS Kaplan-Meier curves are shown in
Fig. 1B.
Table 3 summarizes the clinicopathologic characteristics
and their accordance with OS in radically resected patients.
The median OS was 16.0 months (95% CI, 14.3–17.7). No
association was observed between OS and the studied characteristics, except miR-21. Patients with miR-21 expression
above median had a median OS of 13.2 months (95% CI,
8.3–18.0), whereas the remaining patients had a median OS
of 23.7 months (95% CI, 12.3–35.0; HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4–7.3,
P = 0.008). Similar data were reported for DFS [8.8 mo
(95% CI, 4.7–18.0) versus 23.6 mo (95% CI, 12.3–35.0)], for
miR-21 above and below the median, with HR = 4.4
(95% CI, 1.8–10.7; P = 0.001).
Univariate analysis of patients in the adjuvant and in the
metastatic setting (n = 59) showed that the treatment setting
was a significant prognostic factor of OS, whereas stage
showed a trend toward significant association, and age,
gender, and infiltration were not correlated with outcome
(Table 3). However, a significant difference in survival curves
was still found according to miR-21 expression levels, with
OS of 8.8 (95% CI, 5.8–11.8) versus 16.2 (95% CI, 13.3–19.2)
months (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3–4.1; P = 0.007; Fig. 1C). Multivariate analysis indicated that the adjuvant setting of therapy
and the high miR-21 expression were independent predictors
of PDAC prognosis (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.6, with P < 0.001 for
adjuvant setting, and HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2–5.3, with P = 0.003
for miR-21 expression above median, respectively).

miR-21 is expressed in all PDAC cells and significantly
increased after gemcitabine treatment. The expression of
miR-21 was detectable in all PDAC cell lines/cultures as well
as in hTERT-HPNE cells and Hs27 fibroblasts. However, this
expression differed among cells, ranging from 4.5 a.u. in PL45
to 0.1 a.u. in Hs27 cells (Fig. 2A). miR-21 expression levels in
primary cultures were correlated to the expression detected
in their respective tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Although the small sample size of cells used in this study
precluded the assessment of the predictive value of miR-21
expression data as validated determinants of chemosensitivity, the Spearman test showed a trend toward significant
correlation (P = 0.08) between the miR-21 expression and
gemcitabine IC50s (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, cells with miR-21
expression below the median had significantly lower IC50s
than cells with miR-21 expression above the median (Fig. 2C).
To evaluate whether gemcitabine affects miR-21 expression in vitro, we measured the levels of miR-21 in 13 PDAC
cells/cultures after 72-hour exposure to gemcitabine at IC50.
This treatment resulted in a significant increase of miR-21
expression, ranging from 2.1- to 19.1-fold, in comparison with
basal expression (Fig. 2D).
miR-21 inhibits gemcitabine antiproliferative effects
and apoptosis induction in PDAC cells. To explore the role
of miR-21 on antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induction
after gemcitabine, relatively sensitive (LPc028 and LPc067)
and resistant (LPc111 and LPc006) cells were transfected
with miR-21–specific inhibitor and precursor. Transfection
efficiency was evaluated by analysis of fluorescent microscope images of cells transfected with specific FAM-labeled
pre-miR/anti-miR. These tests showed at least 60% efficiency
for both transfection conditions in each cell type, with >70%
cell viability. Furthermore, we studied miR-21 expression by
quantitative PCR in three of the four transfected cultures,

Gemcitabine cytotoxicity. A dose-dependent inhibition of
cell growth was observed after gemcitabine treatment in all

(LPc028) to 38.1 ± 3.0 nmol/L (PL45).

showing a 3-, 2-, and 1.8-fold increase of miR-21 expression
in LPc067, LPc111, and LPc028 cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). The increased expression of miR-21 was
associated with ∼15% increased proliferation and reduced
apoptosis in cells transfected with pre-miR-21, suggesting
that aberrant expression of this miRNA enhanced cell growth.
Transfection with pre-miR-21 resulted in significant reduction of gemcitabine antiproliferative effects, with increase of 72-hour exposure to gemcitabine at IC50s from
1.3 ± 0.3 nmol/L (LPc028), 7.2 ± 0.6 nmol/L (LPc006),
5.5 ± 0.9 nmol/L (LPc067), and 16.6 ± 2.0 nmol/L (LPc111)

respectively (Fig. 3A).
The effects on apoptosis induction by gemcitabine were
studied on LPc028 and LPc067 cells, which were relatively

sensitive to gemcitabine antiproliferative effects but characterized by miR-21 expression above and below the median,
respectively. The different assays allowed the evaluation of
early apoptosis, late apoptosis, and global cell death, showing
similar results (Supplementary Fig. S3). Both cultures showed
decreased gemcitabine-induced apoptosis when transfected
with pre-miR-21. In LPc067 cells, early apoptosis was reduced from 38% to 23%, whereas late apoptosis was reduced
from 8% to 5%, as detected by Annexin V assay. In contrast,
LPc067 cells transfected with anti-miR-21 had increased cell
death, and analysis of typical apoptotic morphology showed
∼10% increased apoptotic index in gemcitabine-treated cells.
Similarly, only 12% of LPc028 underwent apoptosis after
gemcitabine treatment in cells transfected with pre-miR-21,
whereas a higher percentage (28%) was found after gemcitabine

exposure in cells treated with miRNA control (Fig. 3B). Gemcitabine exposure in cells transfected with anti-miR-21 significantly increased apoptotic index up to 39%.
To further investigate the effects of miR-21 on pathways
involved in inhibition of apoptosis, cells were transfected
with pre-miR-21 and treated with gemcitabine and agents
targeting Akt/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, such as LY294002 and rapamycin. The
apoptotic index after LY294002 or rapamycin treatment was

<8% in both cell cultures. These values were reduced around
3% to 5% in cells transfected with pre-miR-21. The combination of gemcitabine with rapamycin slightly increased the apoptotic index in both cell cultures, whereas the combination
of gemcitabine with LY294002 resulted in an additive effect
on apoptosis induction (+6%) only in LPc067 cells. These
combinations were not able to reverse the antiapoptotic effect of pre-miR-21 transfection. However, the combination of
all the three drugs (i.e., gemcitabine + LY294002 + rapamycin)

significantly increased the apoptotic index with respect to
gemcitabine alone and reversed the antiapoptotic effect
observed in the cells transfected with pre-miR-21. The apoptotic index in LPc067 cells transfected with pre-miR-21 and
treated with gemcitabine + LY294002 + rapamycin was 49%
(P < 0.05 versus 28% of LPc067 cells transfected with premiR-21 treated with gemcitabine). Similar results were
observed in the LPc028 cells (Fig. 3B).
miR-21 affects PTEN and Akt expression. Previous studies showed that (a) miR-21 regulates expression of PTEN and
phosphorylation of its downstream kinase Akt (24, 26, 33)
and (b) the reduction of phospho-Akt (pAkt) correlated with

antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that Akt
pathway plays a significant role in mediating drug resistance
in PDAC cells (41). Therefore, we investigated the PTEN
expression and Akt phosphorylation status before and after
pre-miR-21 transfection and drug treatment.
Pre-miR-21 transfection reduced PTEN expression in all the
cell cultures (Fig. 3C), whereas tumors with high miR-21
expression had lower PTEN expression (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Akt phosphorylation was evaluated in two cell cultures,
including LPc028, described previously, and LPc006 (relatively
resistant to gemcitabine and with high miR-21 expression).
Transfection with pre-miR-21 resulted in an increase of

LPc028 cells, respectively. In contrast, transfection with antimiR-21 significantly reduced pAkt/Akt ratio, from 0.198 to
0.092 U/ng in LPc006 and from 0.403 to 0.142 U/ng in
LPc028 cells.
Gemcitabine exposure slightly reduced pAkt/Akt ratio in
LPc006 but significantly affected this ratio in LPc028 cells.
Similarly, LY294002 significantly impaired the activation
status of Akt in both cell cultures. In contrast, in LPc006 cells,
rapamycin hardly affected Akt phosphorylation at serine
residue pS473 nor total Akt levels but increased pAkt/Akt
ratio in LPc028 cells. In the LPc006 cells, the lowest levels
of pAkt/Akt compared with control were observed after
exposure to the combination of gemcitabine and LY294002.
However, pAkt/Akt ratio was potently (>50%) downregulated
by the combination of rapamycin with gemcitabine and
LY294002 in both LPc006 and LPc028 cells (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, the combination of gemcitabine and
LY294002 after pre-miR-21 transfection resulted in 18%
decrease of pAkt/Akt ratio with respect to untreated premiR-21–transfected cells, but a more pronounced inhibition
was detected after the combination of all three drugs (−32%)
in LPc006-transfected cells. Similar results were found after
the combination of gemcitabine, rapamycin, and LY294002 in
LPc028 cells, with pAkt/Akt ratio reduced to 0.318 U/ng.
miR-21 enhanced metalloproteinase expression and
vascular endothelial growth factor expression/secretion.
Because miR-21 has been reported to have proinvasion and
proangiogenic effects, we evaluated the expression of possible
markers of these activities.
As marker for invasion, we investigated mRNA expression
of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in LPc067
cells transfected with miR-21, showing a 5.6- to 5.9-fold increase (P < 0.05). As marker for angiogenesis, we evaluated
both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA
expression levels and VEGF secretion into the medium,
showing an increase after miR-21 transfection of +20% and
+104% (LPc028) and +36% and +58% (LPc067), respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Discussion
This study evaluated the effect of miR-21 on the outcome
of PDAC and, to our knowledge, is the first to show its association with PFS and OS in advanced PDAC patients treated
with gemcitabine. Furthermore, we observed a significant
association between miR-21 expression and DFS/OS in patients who underwent radical resection and were treated
with gemcitabine in the adjuvant setting.
Recent trials supported the use of chemotherapy in radically resected patients, but the most effective regimen (gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) remains unclear (7, 8).
Similarly a phase 3 trial showed that a cisplatin–epirubicin–
5-fluorouracil–gemcitabine regimen obtained a 1-year survival
rate of 38.5%, which was significantly better than single-agent
gemcitabine (6). However, there are still no guidelines for
selecting treatment for PDAC both in the adjuvant and in
the metastatic setting.

Several molecular predictors of response and toxicity to chemotherapy in PDAC are being investigated, including germ-line
markers such as polymorphisms (9), tumor-related molecular
markers such as mutations, and aberrations in mRNA/protein
expression (11, 42). Over the last few years, miRNA emerged as
a prominent class of gene regulators, and their aberrant expression was linked to different tumors, including PDAC (13, 17 18).
Several studies suggested their use for diagnostic purpose,
showing that expression pattern of 217 miRNAs classified poorly differentiated tumors better than data from 16,000 mRNA
(43). However, a miRNA can regulate multiple coding genes
related to tumor growth and is also likely to more effectively
reflect the status and outcome of a disease.
More than 500 miRNAs are expressed in human cells, but
high-throughput screenings identified a limited number of
key miRNAs. Since its identification as the miRNA most
strongly upregulated in glioblastoma, miR-21 has attracted
the attention of researchers in various fields (22). In situ hybridization showed strong miR-21 expression only in PDAC
cells but not in the surrounding stroma (36). Interestingly, in
the present study, we observed a significant lower expression
of miR-21 in 10 tumor samples, which were not obtained by
LMD, than in their corresponding laser-microdissected specimens. This suggests that LMD succeeded in eliminating the
stroma, which can mask the true expression of miR-21. The
study of Dillhoff and colleagues (36) also reported that miR-21
overexpression was predictive of shorter survival in nodenegative but not in all the patients. However, this subset of
patients was small (n = 17), and they had a significantly
longer OS than patients with positive lymph nodes. Previous
studies reported controversial data about the prognostic role
of lymph node and staging, and most PDAC patients have
American Joint Committee on Cancer stage >2A at diagnosis
(44), as in our population.
Several studies showed that more advanced/malignant
tumors expressed higher levels of miR-21 (32–35). However,
in gastric carcinomas, in which miR-21 can serve as a diagnostic marker, its levels did not seem to have prognostic
value (45), whereas reports in patients with diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma suggested that high levels of miR-21 in
tumor and serum were associated with better prognosis (46).
These controversial data suggested that the prognostic
role of miR-21 is possibly tumor specific as well as treatment
related. Indeed, miR-21 expression was correlated with resistance to several anticancer agents in different models (15, 23,
26, 37). In particular, inhibition of miR-21 increased sensitivity and apoptosis induction by gemcitabine in PDAC but not
in colon cancer cells (25, 38).
The present study revealed that PDAC cells with miR-21
expression below the median had significantly lower gemcitabine IC50s than cells with miR-21 expression above the
median. miR-21 expression was similar in PDAC cultures
and their respective tissues, as reported in glioblastoma
cultures and tumors (22), suggesting the suitability of these
ex vivo models for further molecular analysis. However, miR-21
expression was detectable at similar levels in PDAC and
hTERT-HPNE cells. These results can be explained by the fact
that although hTERT-HPNE cells (47) have a normal phenotype

miR-21 and Gemcitabine Resistance in Pancreatic Cancer

(diploid, with wild-type p16INK4a, K-Ras, and p53), miR-21
expression may be related to the immortalization of these
cells by the ectopic expression of hTERT, as reported previously in the immortalized pancreatic ductal cells HPDE (25).
Of note, miR-21 expression was increased after exposure to
gemcitabine in all PDAC cells, suggesting that this miRNA
can also contribute to acquired chemoresistance and explain
the short time of response/stabilization in most PDAC patients. However, no tissues from previously treated patients
were available, and high levels of miR-21 may not only characterize cancers but also represent a common feature of
pathologic growth or stress, as observed in models of mouse
hypertrophic heart (48).
Further, we studied the activity of miR-21 on pharmacologic effects of gemcitabine and molecular pathways involved
in its activity. Increased expression of miR-21 following
transfection with a specific precursor led to a significant
reduction of antiproliferative effects and apoptotic index
in cells treated with gemcitabine, as reported previously
(25, 27). Computational algorithms predict hundreds of
mRNA as possible targets for miR-21, but only a few of them
have been experimentally validated and are involved in apoptosis regulation. Previous studies showed that both miR-21
and anti-miR-21 modulated a luciferase construct containing
PTEN 3′ untranslated region and the expression of PTEN
in vitro, whereas the staining of PTEN was reversely correlated
with miR-21 in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (24, 26, 33).
Other reports did not find changes in PTEN expression after
transfection with miR-21 precursors in PDAC cells (25), but
in the present study, transfection with pre-miR-21 resulted in
reduction of PTEN expression, which was also negatively correlated with miR-21 expression in 14 PDAC samples. Furthermore, in agreement with the hypothesis that overexpression
of miR-21 leads to downregulation of PTEN and a more active
signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt
pathway, rendering the cancer cells less susceptible to apoptosis, we found that increased miR-21 expression was associated with activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Then, we
showed that drugs targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway reduced pAkt levels and enhanced apoptosis when used in
combination with gemcitabine. These findings are consistent
with studies showing that addition of PI3K inhibitors to
gemcitabine-treated cells decreased pAkt and increased apoptosis (41). In contrast, rapamycin treatment alone resulted
in highly increased pAkt levels compared with untreated cells

and cells treated with gemcitabine. These results can be
explained by the ability of rapamycin to inhibit the mTORC1mediated pathway through dephosphorylation of several
downstream effectors, including S6K1, which acted as antagonist of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (49). Therefore, rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 resulted in induction
of Akt activity (50). However, the pAkt/Akt ratio was strongly
downregulated by the combination of rapamycin with gemcitabine and LY294002, and the combination of the three
drugs overcame the resistance to apoptosis caused by premiR-21 transfection, yielding useful information on critical
targets to reduce chemoresistance.
Another recently identified miR-21 target is RECK, which
might mediate miR-21 invasiveness and angiogenesis by inhibiting MMPs (22). Therefore, we studied mRNA expression
of MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as mRNA and protein expression of VEGF, which were positively correlated with miR-21
expression, as reported in other PDAC cells (25).
The consistency and strength of the accumulating preclinical data, together with our clinical data on correlation with
outcome, strongly suggest that PDAC cells are more aggressive and resistant to gemcitabine if they have high expression
of miR-21, which therefore represents a promising target for
prognostic and therapeutic approaches.
About the prognostic use of miR-21, further validation in
prospective studies is warranted, and more accessible samples
sources, such as miR-21–enriched tumor-derived exosomes
from blood, should be investigated. Similarly, the modulation
of miR-21 targets seems as a promising adjuvant to current
therapies of PDAC in selected patients, thus providing a potential new tool for treatment optimization.
