ABSTRACT
The glycerophospholipid phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid
species of eukaryotic membranes and essential for structural integrity and signaling
function of cell membranes required for cancer cell growth. Inhibition of choline
kinase alpha (CHKA), the first committed step to phosphatidylcholine synthesis, by
the selective small-molecule ICL-CCIC-0019, potently suppressed growth of a panel of
60 cancer cell lines with median GI50 of 1.12 μM and inhibited tumor xenograft growth
in mice. ICL-CCIC-0019 decreased phosphocholine levels and the fraction of labeled
choline in lipids, and induced G1 arrest, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis.
Changes in phosphocholine cellular levels following treatment could be detected
non-invasively in tumor xenografts by [18F]-fluoromethyl-[1,2–2H4]-choline positron
emission tomography. Herein, we reveal a previously unappreciated effect of choline
metabolism on mitochondria function. Comparative metabolomics demonstrated that
phosphatidylcholine pathway inhibition leads to a metabolically stressed phenotype
analogous to mitochondria toxin treatment but without reactive oxygen species
activation. Drug treatment decreased mitochondria function with associated reduction
of citrate synthase expression and AMPK activation. Glucose and acetate uptake were
increased in an attempt to overcome the metabolic stress. This study indicates that
choline pathway pharmacological inhibition critically affects the metabolic function of
the cell beyond reduced synthesis of phospholipids.

INTRODUCTION

nutrient availability; under such conditions cancer cells
activate de novo lipogenesis to support growth [3–5].
The synthesized fatty acids serve as membrane
components important for the cell’s structural integrity and
lipid signaling function.
The glycerophospholipid phosphatidylcholine
(PC) is the most abundant phospholipid species of
eukaryotic membranes and synthesized via the CDPcholine pathway (Supplementary Figure S1A). Upon
uptake, choline is phosphorylated via choline kinase
(CHK) to phosphocholine (PCho). The high energy
donor CDP-choline is then formed from the activating

The majority of neoplasms share the characteristic
of a deregulated cellular metabolism to satisfy the
diverse demands of biomolecule synthesis required
for proliferation [1, 2]. Elevated glucose utilization is
clinically routinely assessed by 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-Dglucose ([18F]-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)
imaging for cancer diagnosis and treatment surveillance.
In addition to altered glycolytic handling, lipid metabolism
is also frequently deregulated in cancer, particularly in
metabolically challenging microenvironments with limited

nucleotide cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and PCho
by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT).
In the final step, CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol
cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) catalyzes the formation
of PC from CDP-choline and diacylglycerol (DAG). CHK
exists in at least three isoforms: CHKA1, CHKA2 and
CHKB encoded by two separate genes, of which the A,
but not the B isoforms, have been implicated in cancer [6].
While under normal physiological conditions, CCT is the
rate-limiting step of the pathway, CHKA is anticipated to
be a major regulator in cancer [7, 8].
Aberrant choline metabolic profiles and concomitant
CHKA upregulation have been described in most human
malignancies, including lung, breast, prostate and
endometrial cancer [9–13]. Use of the radiolabeled choline
analogue [11C]-choline was recently approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration as a diagnostic tool for
staging of recurrent prostate cancer. Hyperactivated choline
metabolism is characterized by elevated intracellular
concentrations of PCho and total choline-containing
metabolites [14]. The overexpression of CHKA, has been
identified to be mainly responsible for this phenotype
[7]. CHKA expression is of prognostic significance in
clinical breast and lung cancer, where overexpression
correlates with disease progression, poor prognosis and
reduced survival [9, 15]. Additionally, CHKA has been
linked to drug resistance by activating multidrug resistance
transporters and to invasiveness [16, 17]. Breast cancer cells
exhibit with increasing malignant progression correlatively
elevated PCho accumulation [18].
The CDP-choline pathway is distinctly regulated by
de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. Choline kinase activity is
stimulated by growth factors, like epidermal growth factor
(EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), as well
as oncogenes including Ras, Raf, Mos and c-Src [7].
Although many mitogenic and growth promoting factors
result in CHKA, but not CCT, activation, the exact
mechanisms remain unclear. Transcriptional silencing of
CHKA depletes the intracellular PCho pool [19, 20], which
translates into reduced proliferation of MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468 and HeLa cells [20, 21] and induction of
apoptosis [22]. Furthermore, it promotes differentiation,
prevents anchorage-independent growth in HeLa cells
and abolishes their ability to form xenografts in athymic
mice [20, 21]. Due to its involvement in oncogenic
transformation, upregulation in a variety of cancers, and
interaction with key signal transduction pathways, CHKA
has emerged as a potential target for cancer therapeutics.
Previous pharmacological approaches lacked sufficient
reporting of specificity, selectivity over other kinases,
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Furthermore,
the effect of CHKA inhibition on metabolism beyond the
CDP-choline pathway is unappreciated. Here we elucidate
the impact of CHKA inhibition on tumor metabolism
using the novel and specific inhibitor ICL-CCIC-0019.

ICL-CCIC-0019 is a potent and selective CHKA
inhibitor
Using a focused-library screen, we recently identified
a novel small-molecule CHKA inhibitor, ICL-CCIC-0019
(Figure 1A) that is competitive with choline, but not ATP
[23]; see this reference for full synthesis of ICL-CCIC-0019
(compound 8 therein). In the present study, we show that
the compound inhibits CHKA activity with an IC50 of
0.27 ± 0.06 μM and compared with previously described
easily accessible CHK inhibitors, is equipotent to MN58B
and > 500 times more potent than CK37 (Figure  1B,
Supplementary Figure S1B). The substantially less
demanding synthesis of ICL-CCIC-0019 compared with
MN58B bears additional advantages. ICL-CCIC-0019 dosedependently reduced the uptake of [3H]-choline into HCT116
cells with an EC50 of 0.98 ± 0.24 μM (Figure 1C). This
consequently diminished intracellular PCho concentration,
and importantly, the incorporation of [3H]-choline into
lipids (Figure 1D). Diminution of [3H]-choline labeling of
lipids occurred at similar levels to PCho, suggesting that
ICL- CCIC-0019 not only depleted the intracellular PCho
pool, but also inhibits the synthesis of choline-containing
lipids, like PC. To assess kinase specificity, ICL-CCIC-0019
was tested against a panel of 131 human kinases (Figure 1E
and Supplementary Table S1). The compound showed low
off-target effects as only 5 kinases were inhibited more
than 20% at a concentration of 10 μM (≤ 35% in all 131
kinases). Inhibition greater than 20% was attained for
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1R, 35 ± 7% inhibition),
mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase
3 (MAPKAP-K3, 33 ± 6%), extracellular signal regulated
kinase 8 (ERK8, 31 ± 4%), ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1,
22 ± 6%), and v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral
oncogene homolog 4 (HER4, 21 ± 7%).
In an initial cell line screen comprising 8 cancer
and 2 normal cell lines, cancer-derived lineages were
preferentially inhibited with a mean half-maximal
growth inhibitory concentration (GI50) of 1.09 μM (range
0.38–2.7 μM), while normal cells were insensitive at
these concentrations (GI50 30–120 μM; Figure 1F). The
compound was then screened against a larger panel of
cancer cell lines of diverse histopathologic origin, the
NCI-60 screen [24]. The median GI50 across all cell lines
was 1.12 μM (range 0.0389–16.2 μM, Figure 2). Breast
and non-small lung cancer cell lines were most sensitive
(median GI50 0.627 and 0.751 μM, respectively), which
is line with evidence in the literature of particularly
deregulated choline biochemistry in those cancers [9, 10].
Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of ICLCCIC-0019 proved to be equipotent to MN58B and
superior to CK37 (Supplementary Figure S1C). Mining

expression data identified CHKA amplification and/or
mRNA upregulation in 11% of breast, 5–10% of lung,
8% of ovarian, 7% of colorectal and 5% of prostate
cancers. Furthermore, CHKA mRNA expression is
higher in multiple tumor types compared to normal tissue
(Supplementary Figure S1D). The gene was rarely mutated
or deleted (0–2.5% mutation rate and < 1% deletion among
all tested cancer types). The consistently high expression
in a wide variety of tumor types highlights the relevance
of CHKA in malignancy and role as a therapeutic target.
Knockdown of CHKA by shRNA produced
similar biochemical and growth inhibitory effects as
ICL-CCIC-0019 (Supplementary Figure S1E–S1H).
Due the bolaamphiphilic character of the ICL-

CCIC-0019 compound class, comparable to surfactants,
we investigated the potential of the compound to nonspecifically lyse cells. Surfactant-induced cell lysis
triggers formation of pores in the cell membrane and
subsequent release of cytosolic proteins, such as lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), into the supernatant [25].
Incubation of HCT116 cells with 1–25 μM ICLCCIC-0019 did not elevate LDH concentration in the
supernatant (Supplementary Figure S1I). Furthermore,
enzyme dimerization, which is required to exert CHKA
activity, was not compromised by treatment with ICLCCIC-0019 (Supplementary Figure S1J), inferring that
the mechanism of action did not involve destabilization of
CHKA complexes.

protein, thus permitting non-invasive assessment of
enzyme activity (pharmacodynamics) in the physiological
and complex milieu of the tumor, as well as normal tissues.
A marked reduction in radiotracer uptake was observed
in ICL-CCIC-0019-treated HCT116 xenografts at 24 and
48 hours following a i.p. single dose of 10 mg/kg, compared
to the vehicle-treated cohort [AUC0–60 control: 191.9
(%ID/mL)*min; AUC0–60 24 hours: 145.8 (%ID/mL)*min;
AUC0–60 48 hours: 139.4 (%ID/mL)*min; Figure 4D–4E].
Interestingly, despite the rapid tissue distribution, whereby
ICL-CCIC-0019 concentrations in the tumors peaked
at 2 hours post injection, PET imaging at 6 hours post
ICL-CCIC-0019 administration did not result in significant
reduction of [18F]-D4-FCH uptake [AUC0–60 6 hours: 187.7
(%ID/mL)*min]. While cardiac pharmacodynamics were
not influenced by treatment, liver and kidney radiotracer
retentions were diminished, comparable to tumor data
(Figure 4F and Supplementary Figure S2B).
We employed kinetic modeling to further
characterize ICL-CCIC-0019-mediated choline kinase
inhibition in vivo. Whereas normalized tissue uptake
values reflect tracer concentration in a 3-dimensional
region of interest, kinetic modeling accounts for tissue
uptake relative to plasma. A two-tissue irreversible
compartmental model, as previously reported, was
employed with the hypothesis that k3 would represent
the rate by which the tracer is phosphorylated by
choline kinase [28], (Supplementary Figure S2C).
Although this enzymatic reaction is in principle
reversible, it was assumed that the high dependency
of cancer cells to incorporate choline made it unlikely
that catalytic hydrolysis of PCho prevails. Best fits and
more physiological parameters were obtained with a 3k
(excluding k4) instead of a 4k model. ICL-CCIC-0019
treatment significantly decreased tumor K1, denoting the
flux from blood to tissue, at all investigated time points
(73% and 75% decrease compared to control after 24 and
48 hours, respectively; Supplementary Figure S2D) and
to a lesser extent in kidneys and liver (Supplementary
Figure S2D). The opposing flux from tissue into the blood
stream, k2, was slightly decreased by treatment in tumor
(Supplementary Figure S2D). Interestingly, the micro
rate constant k3, which represents intracellular radiotracer
trapping, was non-significantly altered (Supplementary
Figure S2D). In consequence to these micro parameter
changes, the macro parameter Ki denoting the net
irreversible uptake rate was significantly decreased in
tumor after 48 hours (Figure 4G and Supplementary
Figure S2D); changes in kinetic flux were predominantly
driven by alterations in K1. In all examined tissues, the
blood volume Vb decreased initially after treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2D). These perfusion deficits
were more pronounced and persistent in tumor compared
to liver and kidney. To rule out that these kinetic changes
are solely due to choline transport inhibition, we analyzed
the choline metabolites of [18F]-D4-FCH in HCT116 cells

ICL-CCIC-0019 dose-dependently arrested cells
in the G1 phase of the cell cycle after 24 h of treatment
(2-fold increase at 10 μM) and increased the sub-G1
population, representing apoptotic and dead cells, 3.7fold after 48 h (Figure 3A). Caspase-3/7-mediated
apoptosis was seen following 48 h treatment with varying
concentrations of ICL-CCIC-0019 in HCT116, HUH-7
and MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 3B). Depletion of PC
was previously shown to induce ER stress [26]. Therefore,
the expression of ER stress response markers was
investigated. ICL-CCIC-0019 dose- and time-dependently
increased the expression of ATF4, a transcription factor for
target proteins that resolve ER stress, and to lesser extent
IRE1α (Figure 3C). In keeping with above, expression and
nuclear localization of the transcription factor CHOP was
higher in ICL-CCIC-0019 treated cells independent of
protein ubiquitination and HSP70 expression. Moderate
increases in HSP90 expression might have further
contributed to the ER stress phenotype. Notably, ER stress
was not accompanied by formation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS, Figure 3D).

ICL-CCIC-0019 inhibits CHKA in vivo and has
potent antitumor activity
We selected the HCT116 xenograft model
for further work. HCT116 cells have intermediate
sensitivity to ICL-CCIC-0019 and we have previously
shown that the model is sensitive to inhibitory activity
of other drugs on [18F]-D4-FCH tumor uptake [27].
Plasma pharmacokinetic profiles were established in
BALB/c mice following a single injection of 10 mg/kg
ICL-CCIC-0019. ICL-CCIC-0019 was rapidly cleared
following i.p. administration and plasma concentrations
above the GI50 of HCT116 cells were maintained for ca.
50 minutes (Figure 4A). Analysis of plasma indicated that
the compound was metabolically stable (Supplementary
Figure S2A) although its oral bioavailability was
limited. BALB/c nude mice bearing HCT116 xenografts
were employed for analysis of tumor, liver, kidney and
plasma concentrations (Figure 4B). The compound was
rapidly extracted by the investigated tissues and tumor
concentrations above the GI50 were maintained throughout
the study (Figure 4B). Extensive accumulation in liver and
kidneys were observed, although clearance from liver was
more rapid than from tumor. In HCT116 xenograft bearing
mice, treatment with ICL-CCIC-0019 on days 1–3 with
5 mg/kg i.p. once a day followed by an 11 day recovery
period (consistent with the inhibitor’s pharmacokinetics)
resulted in potent antitumour activity (Figure 4C). To
determine whether ICL-CCIC-0019 could attenuate
CHKA activity in vivo, [18F]-D4-FCH PET imaging was
performed. The radiotracer and inhibitor target the same

treated with ICL-CCIC-0019. As expected for CHKA
inhibition, ICL-CCIC-0019 decreased the [18F]-D4-PCho
peak, changing the relative ratio of [18F]-D4-Cho:[18F]-D4PCho from 72:28 in the vehicle control to 87:13 in the
treatment group (Supplementary Figure S2E–S2F).
These data support that ICL-CCIC-0019 is a specific
CHKA inhibitor, capable of inhibiting its target in vivo
resulting in potent antitumor activity.

1D), CDP-choline was dose-dependently higher after
inhibitor treatment (Figure 5A). CDP-ethanolamine
pathway intermediates (phosphoethanolamine and CDPethanolamine), as well as precursors of diacylglycerol
required for PC synthesis such as glycerol-3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) were also increased
following ICL-CCIC-0019 treatment (Figure 5B)
suggesting inhibition or reduced substrate availability
for processes culminating in PE and PC synthesis,
independent of PCho inhibition. PCho is affected by
phospholipid breakdown. In the HCT116 cell line,
however, NMR-detectable glycerophosphocholine (GPC)
levels were below the level of quantification (LoQ)
relative to PCho; GPC levels were still undetectable 2 h
after treatment with ICL-CCIC-0019 but increased at 24 h
to levels just above the LoQ (data not shown) indicating
the GPC pathway plays a minor role in this setting.
Treatment with ICL-CCIC-0019 markedly
decreased citrate and cis-aconitate at 1 and 10 μM, and
alpha-ketoglutarate at the high concentration (Figure 5B).

Effect of CHKA inhibition on soluble cellular
metabolites
We then investigated the metabolic consequences
of CHKA inhibition by ICL-CCIC-0019 using liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of soluble
metabolites. CHKA inhibition expectedly decreased the
uptake of choline from the media and potently depleted
the intracellular PCho pool (−56% at 1 μM and −61%
at 10 μM for 24 h, Figure 5A). Unexpectedly, given the
reduction in 3H-choline incorporation into lipids (Figure

Succinate and malate were unaffected (data not shown).
This prompted us to examine in more detail the changes
in metabolism to overcome the TCA cycle defect. The
resulting energy crisis led to increases in the glycolytic
intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Figure 5B).
Low AMP/ATP ratio allosterically stimulates glycolysis
through the rate limiting enzyme phosphofructokinase. We
observed an increased [18F]-FDG uptake (Supplementary
Figure S3A) indicating enhanced glucose flux. Uniformly
13
C-labeled glucose flux studies confirmed increased
glycolysis, as shown by increased glucose-6-phosphate and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Supplementary Figure S3B),
as well as diminished TCA cycle activity (Figure 5C).
The pentose phosphate pathway intermediate ribose

phosphate was increased upon ICL-CCIC-0019
(Supplementary Figure S3C), however, pathways that
branch off glycolysis, as for example serine synthesis
pathway, did not show increased labeling with 13C-glucose
and elevated unlabeled serine suggested enhanced
utilization of exogenous serine (Supplementary Figure
S3D). Serine can condense with palmitate to make 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, a precursor of de novo ceramide
synthesis previously implicated as a marker of choline
kinase inhibitor MN58B [29]. Furthermore, serine can be
a carbon donor to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in two
ways; either as a methyl donor via the tetrahydrofolate
(THF) cycle during methionine salvage or as a carbon
donor to the adenosyl moiety of SAM during nucleotide

biosynthesis (via glycine and the THF cycle) [30]. The
ICL-CCIC-0019 concentration-dependent uptake and
intracellular buildup of serine was found to be associated
with a 11% increase in SAM and 26% decrease in
S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) perhaps suggesting an
increase in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
activity to supply PC from phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE; rather than PE to phosphatidylserine using serine;
thus serine buildup) under the nutrient stress associated
with reduced PC synthesis. It is interesting to note that the
rate of serine biosynthesis was comparable in vehicle and
ICL-CCIC-0019 treated cells (Supplementary Figure S3E)
while the biosynthesis of many other non-essential amino
acids including aspartate and glutamate was strongly
inhibited (Supplementary Figure S3F–S3G). This suggests
that cells expedite serine biosynthesis for SAM production
and downstream PC generation from PE or even ceramide
production.
Furthermore, de novo fatty acid synthesis was
inhibited and neither glucose nor acetate served as
substrates, despite a 10-fold increased acetate uptake
upon ICL-CCIC-0019 treatment (Figure 5D–5E). Most of
the labeled acetate was incorporated into acetyl-carnitine
(Supplementary Figure S3H). Of interest, medium chain
carnitine esters and palmitoycarnitine were markedly
increased (Supplementary Figure S3I) indicating an
inability of the mitochondria to use medium chain esters
derived from peroxisomes. Thus, the dysfunctional TCA
cycle and consequent ER stress appear to increase glucose
uptake, however, lack of possibilities to branch into other
pathways result in almost quantitative secretion as lactate
(Supplementary Figure S3J). The lack of glutamine uptake
under these conditions (Supplementary Figure S3J) is in
keeping with a dysfunctional TCA cycle/mitochondria.
While palmitate M+2 from glucose was higher in drug
treated samples, there was a stark reduction in other
isotopologues (M+4, M+6, M+8, M+10, M+12, and
M+14). Restoration of naturally occurring M+2 from
palmitate when labeling ceases, or unperturbed elongase
activity (mediating addition of glucose-labeled acetylCoA unit to pre-existing myristate) could have led to the
changes in palmitate M+2 seen.

Interestingly, ICL-CCIC-0019 and MN58B decreased
mitochondrial respiration immediately after adding
inhibitor (acute effect; Supplementary Figure S4A, S4B).
The marked inhibition of TCA cycle without increased
ROS, suggested a non-classical mitochondrial toxin effect.
Against the background of energy stress we examined
AMPK substrates. Both phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(pACC) and AMPK pT172 increased with CHKA inhibitor
treatment in a concentration dependent manner in support
of AMPK activation (Figure 6C); total ACC was not
sensitive to different drug concentrations (Supplementary
Figure S4B). Cell-free kinase assays indicated that
ICL-CCIC-0019 did not directly alter AMPK activity
(Figure 1E), while the inhibitor increased the AMP/ATP
ratio (Supplementary Figure S4C). Thus the observed
effect is indirect, likely via sensing of energy stress [31].
We showed that the reduction in citrate following
CHKA inhibition was associated with drug concentration
related decrease in citrate synthase expression in HCT116
cells at 24 h after treatment (Figure 6C). Citrate synthase
(CS), the first rate-limiting enzyme in the TCA cycle is
critical for mitochondrial respiration. Knockdown of
the protein stimulates glycolysis [32] in keeping with
the observations of increased glucose flux seen above.
Reduction in the nuclear encoded CS expression is
also a marker of mitophagy, the selective removal of
mitochondria through autophagy (for review see [33]).
Disruption of mitochondrial function such as treatment
with electron transport chain inhibitors or depletion of
mtDNA does not generally affect CS enzyme expression
or activity, making it a useful semi-quantitative indicator
of mitochondria mass in cells. To confirm specificity of
CS expression in this context we verified the effect of
CHKA inhibition in A549 human lung cancer cells and
isogenic cells with depleted mtDNA (A549 Rho). In
these cells ICL-CCIC-0019 diminished CS expression
irrespective of mtDNA status in comparison with COX2
(Figure 6D). Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles
that exist in networks. Fluorescence microscopy of
mitochondria stained with anti-mitochondrial antibody
distinctly showed disruption of mitochondrial networks
in cells treated with ICL-CCIC-0019 (Figure 6E).
Furthermore tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE)detectable mitochondrial membrane potential decreased
with ICL-CCIC-0019 or MN58B treatment (Figure 6F)
compared to vehicle control or negative control (small
molecule AMPK activator, 991 [34]).

Mitochondrial dysfunction and AMPK as
downstream targets of choline kinase inhibition
A number of observations above led us to further
examine a previously unappreciated involvement of
mitochondria in the mechanism of action of choline
kinase inhibition. Seahorse assays confirmed a doserelated suppression of mitochondrial respiration at
24 h after inhibitor treatment (Figure 6A, 6B). In the
presence of glucose in medium, ICL-CCIC-0019
decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption (basal,
ATP production, maximum respiration, spare capacity
and proton leak) in a drug concentration related manner.

of CHKA by RNAi can reduce cell survival and tumor
growth (Supplementary Figure S1C and [8, 20, 36]).
To date, attention in the field of cancer has focused on

the requirement of choline together with channeling of
fatty acids into PC synthesis to support the increased
need for membrane synthesis; however, this mechanism
alone does not explain the effects of chemical inhibitors.

however, only minimal cytotoxicity is seen with ATPsite binding, relative to choline-site or mixed ATP-site/
choline-site inhibitors, leading to the suggestion that a
CHKA-independent or non-catalytic role for CHKA is
important for promoting cell survival [37]. We report the
pharmacology of a new CHKA inhibitor, and demonstrate
that CHKA chemical inhibition can induce profound ER

stress response and inhibit mitochondrial respiration as
additional potential mechanisms for reduced survival.
As a starting point, we focused on chemical
inhibition of CHKA, using the selective choline-site
specific CHK small-molecule ICL-CCIC-0019 [23].
Notably, structural similarities exist between the N,Ndimethylaminopyridine moiety employed as a cationic

choline-mimicking moiety in ICL-CCIC-0019 [23] and
nature identical lipids such as C2/C6-ceramides, lysophosphatidic acid and lyso-PC. ICL-CCIC-0019 was
highly specific in a multi-kinase screen, decreased PCho
levels together with the fraction of labeled choline in
lipids (mainly PC), and induced G1 arrest, endoplasmic
reticulum stress and apoptosis. We measured incorporation
of [3H]-choline into lipids and assumed therefore that the
diminution of the lipid labeled fraction is due to reduction
of phosphatidylcholine. It should be noted, however,
that [3H]-choline can be metabolized and incorporated
into other lipids including phosphatidylethanolamine or
phosphatidylserine, although these alternative mechanisms
are likely to be limited compared to phosphatidylcholine.
Phosphoethanolamine levels were not decreased upon
drug treatment, suggesting that ICL-CCIC-0019 did not
inhibit ethanolamine kinase. Reduction in cell survival
occurred across 60 cell lines of diverse origin with median
GI50 of 1.12 μM and the compound also inhibited colon
cancer growth in mice.
Based on our data, we assert that the ability of
ICL-CCIC-0019 to effect rapid and sustained reductions
of CDP-choline pathway, precluding significant cellular
adaptation to replenish phosphatidylcholine, likely leads
to reduction in proliferation seen across several cancer
cell lines including the NCI-60 panel. It should be noted,
however, that using a novel CHKA inhibitor, V-11–0711
[37], two independent laboratories have shown that druginduced reductions of steady state PCho occurring after
24 h in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 were not sufficient
to decrease cell viability, compared to CHKA RNAi
[37, 38]; cell viability was lost only in SUM149 cells
at similar drug concentrations. The groups infer that it
is the depletion of CHKA protein - acting through noncatalytic functions [39] - but not inhibition of CHKA
catalytic activity that is able to decrease cell survival. This
conclusion, supported by the insensitivity of catalyticallyinactive mutant CHKA2 D306A transformed cells to
EGF-stimulated growth [39], contrasts the substantial
literature demonstrating anti-proliferative effect of
diverse small molecule CHKA ATP-, choline- and mixedsite binders on cell viability under unrestricted-growth
media conditions and in mice [29, 40–44]. The hypothesis
neither incorporates drug resistance possibilities, nor
importantly the ability of the compounds to rapidly deplete
phosphatidylcholine without significant regeneration.
Thus, while non-catalytic (‘scaffold’) functions of
CHKA exist [39], and loss of the PCho generation step
alone may be insufficient to decrease cell viability under
certain conditions, we cannot rule out that small molecule
inhibitors can affect cell viability via the CDP-choline
pathway due to rapid depletion of dynamic membrane
phosphatidylcholine synthesis required for cellular
integrity and mitochondria function.
Impaired choline transport and phosphorylation
following treatment was detected non-invasively in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumor and liver by whole body [18F]-D4-FCH. The timedependent reduction in flux constant Ki of [18F]-D4-FCH
occurred as a result of drug accumulation in tissue and
inhibition of CHK, and was associated with the tumor
growth inhibition observed. The rapid uptake of labeled
choline tracers, together with limited efflux back into the
blood pool renders kinetic models unable to independently
distinguish between K1 and k3; the macro-parameter Ki
better reflects retention than k3 [28, 45]. Both K1 and Ki
decreased with treatment suggesting that ICL-CCIC-0019
inhibits choline extraction (transfer from blood to tissue)
and retention. Indeed in vitro studies showed that ICLCCIC-0019 competes with a labeled choline tracer for
uptake (Supplementary Figure S2E–S2F). At this stage,
we notionally attributed the reduction in PC seen in
vitro to reduction in PCho. We investigated whether a
non-catalytic modulation of CHKA may be responsible
for the reduced cell survival seen. Alteration in CHKA
dimerization was unaffected by ICL-CCIC-0019 thus
destabilization of the protein was ruled out. Induction of
endoplasmic reticulum stress also led us to investigate
ROS formation; ROS formation was ruled out as a
mechanism of action.
We then resorted to metabolomics to identify
additional mechanisms. We confirmed the reduction
in PCho production and concomitant increases in free
intracellular choline. CDP-Cho pool-size increased dosedependently with drug treatment indicating blockade
of CPT. This observation was unexpected, and while
consistent with our finding of reduced labeled choline
incorporation into PC, could also be explained by
activation of CCT. Further work is required to clarify the
specific enzymes inhibited. The reduction in PC could
also have resulted from reductions in fatty acids or DAG.
In our studies we observed specific decreases in the
following fatty acids: palmitoleic, oleic and dodecanoic
acids, which could have contributed to the reduction in PC
synthesis. DAG levels were not measured. Interestingly,
the analogous CDP-ethanolamine:1,2-diacylglycerol
ethanolaminephosphotransferase (EPT) was also inhibited
but only at higher drug concentration. Very few inhibitors
of CPT/EPT have been reported, and indeed, these two
enzymes were not included in our selectivity screen. In
their study, Bladergroen and co-workers noted that C2ceramides selectively inhibited CPT while C6-ceramides
rapidly inhibited both CPT and EPT [46]. It is therefore
more accurate to refer to ICL-CCIC-0019 as CDP-choline
pathway inhibitor rather than a CHKA inhibitor as it
inhibits the pathway at the commitment step and last step.
Further to the effect on substrate incorporation into
PC, we also revealed a previously unappreciated effect
of chemically inhibiting CDP-choline pathway activity
on mitochondria function. Comparative metabolomics
demonstrated that CHKA inhibition leads to a metabolically
stressed phenotype analogous to mitochondria toxin
treatment at 24 h after ICL-CCIC-0019 treatment.

This drug-induced phenotype involved profound block of
the TCA cycle characterized by a large decrease in steady
state levels of mitochondria enzyme-related metabolites
including citrate and cis-aconitate, whereas α-ketoglutarate
only decreased at the higher concentration. Conversely,
glycolysis was increased after short-term incubation with
ICL-CCIC-0019 (increased ECAR) accompanied by
elevation of glycolysis-related metabolic intermediates
including fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, glucose-6-phosphate,
dihydroxyacetone phosphate and serine to provide
important substrates to overcome the TCA cycle block.
Tracing studies using 13C-glucose and [18F]-FDG further
confirmed the increased glycolysis in the context of higher
glucose uptake and quantitative lactate secretion, together
with increases in glycolytic intermediates (increases
in glucose-6-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,
serine), and TCA block (decreased flux into citrate and
decreased glutamine uptake). A study evaluating the
metabolite profile of cells undergoing etoposide-induced
apoptosis [47] reported increases in glucose-6-phosphate,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose 1,6 bisphosphate
with apoptosis; whether our findings are linked to
apoptosis requires further work. In general, fluxes into
long-chain saturated fatty acids increased after treatment,
while long-chain unsaturated fatty acids decreased;
concomitantly, mitochondrial fatty acid-β-oxidation
appeared blocked. We envisaged that TCA cycle block
would limit synthesis of fatty acid from glucose carbons
while fatty acid synthesis from acetate may be unaffected.
By tracing [14C]-acetate, we showed that acetate uptake
was increased in a dose dependent manner. ACC1 and
FASN are cytoplasmic enzymes that can convert acetylcoA to malonyl-coA and further to fatty acids; ACC2,
which can also catalyse conversion of acetyl-coA to
malonyl-coA, is a mitochondrial enzyme. The increased
[14C]-acetate may be a survival mechanism.
We show in this study that ICL-CCIC-0019
inhibits mitochondrial function and activates glycolysis.
The two processes may be linked. Intracellular citrate
concentrations (decreased by ICL-CCIC-0019) and ATP/
AMP concentrations (determinants of AMPK activity)
are potent modulators of the rate limiting glycolytic
enzyme phosphofructokinase [48]. ICL-CCIC-0019
activated AMPK (measured as increased pACC and pT172
expression), which may have contributed to the activation
of glycolysis. From the kinase screen, we know that the
effect of ICL-CCIC-0019 on AMPK was not a direct
one but rather via modulation of cellular (mitochondrial)
dynamics and possibly downstream of changes in
mitochondria membrane potential and profound reduction
of mitochondria respiration. The decrease in mitochondrial
respiration occurred rapidly, as early as 5 min after adding
ICL-CCIC-0019 suggesting a possible direct interaction
of drug with mitochondria. From the observations made

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in this study, other potential mechanisms that can generate
the reduced mitochondrial respiration phenotype include
enhanced ethanolamine pathway activity (increased
PEth and CDP-Eth) [49] or reduction in PCho and PC/
PE [50, 51] and its effect on mitochondrial membrane
asymmetry and membrane potential. Mitochondria have
a strict requirement for highly dynamic translocation of
membrane lipids synthesized in the cytoplasm, golgi or
endoplasmic reticulum to support membrane integrity [52].
Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential in the
hindlimb muscle of chkb-/- mice can be rescued by
injection of CDP-choline suggesting a genetic basis
in appropriate model systems. Thus, we can surmise
that glycolysis was activated to support the inability of
mitochondria to synthesize ATP (mitochondria membrane
potential is required for ATP synthesis) and may explain
the overall lack of significant reduction in cellular ATP.
Another interesting phenotype observed following
treatment with ICL-CCIC-0019 was loss of mitochondrial
networks. This was concomitant with a decrease of
mitochondrial mass, characterized by reductions in citrate
synthase expression in the colon cancer cells. Citrate
synthase is a mitochondrial DNA encoded gene product,
whose expression is a marker of cellular mitochondrial
content (mitophagy biomarker). Interestingly, the ICLCCIC-0019-induced citrate synthase depletion occurred
in both A549 wild-type and A549 Rho cells that had lost
mtDNA indicating that the ‘mitochondria stress phenotype’
was not due to effects on mitochondria redox carriers
(Complex I-IV) required for mitochondrial respiration.
This was further supported by reduced aspartate levels
(Supplementary Figure S3E), which is largely synthesized
via mitochondrial glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase
(GOT2) [53]. There is evidence that AMPK - a sensor of
energetics - couples nutrient sensing and environmental
stress to mitophagy and cell survival via phosphorylation
of ULK1/2 or hATG1 [54].
In summary, we report a new mechanism of
action for CDP-choline pathway chemical inhibition
by ICL-CCIC-0019. In this model, drug treatment
elicits loss of mitochondria membrane potential and
mitochondrial respiration. The mitochondrial stress
that ensues is concomitant with increased glycolysis,
a process that is associated with AMPK activation.
These newly described properties of choline kinase
chemical inhibitors need to be considered when rational
combinations are proposed.

Choline kinase activity, proliferation, apoptosis
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays
Enzymatic kinase activity, [3H]choline to [3H]PCho
conversion and growth inhibition assays was conducted
as previously described [23]. [3H]choline incorporation
into soluble and lipid fractions was determined by a
pulse-chase experiment. HCT116 cells were seeded at a
density of 3 × 105 cell per well into 12-well plates and
incubated overnight. Cells were treated with 1 or 10
μM ICL-CCIC-0019 for 1 h and pulsed in presence of
inhibitor with 18.5 kBq/mL [3H]choline chloride in 500
μL for 1 additional h. Cells were briefly rinsed with RPMI
and incubated with fresh, non-radioactive medium for
6 h. Metabolites were extracted as described elsewhere
[23], but additionally the radioactivity of the cholinecontaining and chloroform (lipid-containing) fractions was
measured. Uptake of radiolabeled metabolite-tracers was
measured as described elsewhere [56]. Antiproliferative
activity was measured after 72 h continuous exposure to
inhibitors by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as described
elsewhere [23]. Apoptosis was determined using Caspase
3/7 Glo assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
For ROS measurements, cells were seeded in 96well plates and treated with indicated ICL-CCIC-0019
(10 μM), pro- and antioxidants (0.25% H2O2 and 5 mM
N-acetyl cysteine, NAC; all from Sigma-Aldrich) for

medium containing vehicle or 1 μM ICL-CCIC-0019 for
24 h. The medium was then replaced with that containing
13
C metabolites (5 mM 13C6-glucose or 0.2  mM 13C2acetate) and inhibitor for various indicated time points.
Metabolites were extracted with a cold solution (−20oC)

supernatant was collected for subsequent LC-MS analysis.
A ZIC-pHILIC column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, guard column
2.1 mm × 20 mm, Merck) was used for LC separation
using formic acid, water, and acetonitrile as component

Analysis of mitochondrial function
Mitochondrial respiration
Extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption
rates (ECAR and OCR) were measured in a XF24
extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse XF24 Extra Cellular
Flux Analyzer, North Billerica, MA, USA). Basic XF
assay medium was prepared as previously described [60]
supplemented with glucose, and the pH adjusted to 7.4 at
37°C. Indicated final concentrations of compounds were
obtained by injecting appropriate amounts of compounds
dissolved in DMSO or water and diluted in XF assay
medium into ports. For ECAR and OCR measurements
40–50,000 HCT116 cells were plated in each well in
RPMI overnight and the assay was carried out according
to the XF24 assay protocol suggested by the manufacturer.
Indicated data points were obtained after 3 min mixing
and 2 min wait, followed by 3 min of data collection. Data
were normalized to the basal values.
Mitochondrial protein and phospho-protein expression
1.5–2.0 × 106 HCT116 cells were plated on 10 cm
plates in RPMI medium. After 24 h, cells were treated
with indicated concentrations of CHK inhibitors for a
further 24 h. Plates were then washed with ice cold PBS
and cells were removed with 300 μL lysis buffer (50 mM
HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM DTT, 1%
triton and phosphatase and protease inhibitors), syringed
through a 25G needle and incubated on ice for 10 min.
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 min
and the total extracts were collected and stored at –80°C.
About 60 mg of cell extracts were used for western blot
analysis. Antibodies used for western analysis include,
from Millipore, total acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC;
05-1098); from Cell Signalling, phosphorylated-ACC
(pACC-S76; CS3661L), AMPK anti-pT172 (CS2535L),
AMPK anti-B1 and B2 (CS 4150); from Abcam anticytochrome C oxidase subunit II (MTCOX-2; ab110258),

Choline extraction and radio-HPLC
We determined the effect of ICL-CCIC-0019 on
initial choline extraction (transport and phosphorylation;
Supplementary Figure S2E–S2F) using a modification of
previously described methods [59]. Instead of [14C]choline,
we used the catabolically more stable choline analogue,
[18F]-D4-FCH. MN58b and Hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) were
used as controls. HPLC was performed using methods
previously reported by us for this radiotracer [27].

Mitochondrial immunofluorescence

PET-CT imaging

20,000 HCT116 cells were plated on glass
coverslips. After 24 h, cells were treated with 5 μM
ICL-CCIC-0019. After 24 h cells were fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blocked with fish
gelatin overnight. Blocked cells were incubated with
antimitochondrial antibody (Abcam; ab110413, 1:200
dilution) for 8–10 h. Coverslips were further washed
with PBS and mounted with vector shield and DAPI, and
imaged on a SP5 confocal microscope (Leica).

Mice were anesthetized through isoflurane
inhalation and scanned on a Siemens Multimodality
Inveon small animal PET-CT scanner for [18F]-D4-FCH
PET studies using HCT116 xenografts. Low dose CT
scans were first acquired (80 kVp, 0.5 mA, 220 degree
rotation, 600 ms per degree exposure time, 80 μm
reconstruction pixel size) for PET attenuation correction
and anatomical reference. PET images were acquired
following a bolus i.v. injection of approximately 3.7
MBq tracer in the tail vein. Dynamic emission scans were
acquired in list mode format over 60 minutes. Data were
sorted into 0.5 mm sinogram bins and 19 time frames for
image reconstruction by filtered back projection (4 × 15
seconds, 4 × 60 seconds and 11 × 300 seconds). The
Siemens Inveon Research Workplace software was used for
visualization of radiotracer uptake. To define 3-dimensional
regions of interest (ROI), 30 to 60-minute cumulative
images of the dynamic were employed. Arterial input
function was estimated by drawing ROIs over the center
of the heart cavity using cumulative images from 0.25
to 2 minutes of the dynamic series, a method previously
validated for use in rodents [62]. The count densities were
averaged for all ROIs at each time point to obtain time
versus radioactivity curves (TAC). Tumor TACs were
normalized to injected dose measured by a VDC-304 dose
calibrator (Veenstra Instruments) and normalized uptake
was expressed as percentage injected dose per mL tissue
(NUV; %ID/mL).

TMRE-Membrane potential assay
HCT116 cells were cultured as above with indicated
inhibitors and subject to the tetramethylrhodamine ethyl
ester dye method (TMRE) membrane potential assay
according to the manufacturers instruction (Abcam
ab113852) prior to FACS analysis.

Animal models
All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office
Guidance on the Operation of The Animals (Scientific
Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012
and within the published guidelines for the welfare and
use of animals in cancer research [61]. Xenografts were
established in female BALB/c nude mice aged 6–8 weeks
(Harlan) by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 100 μL
HCT116 cells (5 × 106 in PBS) on the back of mice.
Tumor dimensions were frequently measured by calliper

3 orthogonal axes of the tumor. When tumor volumes
reached approximately 50–100 mm3 (ca. 10 days post
injection), mice were used for subsequent studies.

Kinetic modeling of [18F]-D4-FCH data
Kinetic analysis of PET data was performed
applying a standard two-tissue irreversible compartmental
model described in detail elsewhere [28].

Pharmacokinetic and plasma metabolite studies

TCGA data analysis

Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of ICLCCIC-0019 were established in female BALB/c mice
aged 6–8 weeks (Harlan). Mice were intraperitoneally
(i.p.) or perorally (p.o.) administered a single dose of
10 mg/kg and blood collected by cardiac puncture after
5, 15, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. For tissue
pharmacokinetic studies, HCT116 xenograft bearing
mice were administered 10 mg/kg ICL-CCIC-0019
i.p. and blood collected after 5 minutes, 2, 6 and 24 h.
Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1000  × g
for 10 minutes. Samples were snap-frozen and stored
at –80°C prior to analysis. Analysis was carried
out by Cyprotex Inc. using liquid chromatography–

The results shown here are in whole based upon
data generated by the TCGA Research Network: http://
cancergenome.nih.gov/ and were analyzed using http://
www.cbioportal.org and http://firebrowse.org.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Unless otherwise specified, the significance of
comparison between two data sets was determined using
unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test (GraphPad Prism
version 5.1) and P < 0.05 defined as significant.
