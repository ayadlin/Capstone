Abstract:

It has been shown that a subset of human cancers, notably, melanoma and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are auxotrophic for arginine (Arg), because they
do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), the rate-limiting enzyme
for the biosynthesis of arginine from citrulline. These ASS-negative cancer cells
require Arg from extracellular sources for survival. When they are exposed to
recombinant Arg-degrading enzymes, e.g. arginine deiminase (ADI) or arginase,
they die because of Arg starvation; whereas normal cells which express ASS are
able to survive. A pegylated ADI (ADI-PEG20) has been developed for clinical
trials for advanced melanoma and HCC; and favorable results have been obtained.
ADI-PEG20 treatment induces autophagy in auxotrophic cancer cells leading
to cell death. Clinical studies in melanoma patients show that re-expression of
ASS is associated with ADI-PEG20 resistance.
ADI-PEG20 treatment downregulates the expression of HIF-1α but up-regulates c-Myc in culture melanoma
cells. Induction of ASS by ADI-PEG20 involves positive regulators c-Myc and Sp4
and negative regulator HIF1α. Since both HIF-1α and c-Myc play important roles
in cancer cell energy metabolism, together these results suggest that targeted
cancer cell metabolism through modulation of HIF-1α and c-Myc expression
may improve the efficacy of ADI-PEG20 in treating Arg auxotrophic tumors.

Altered tumor metabolism as target for cancer
chemotherapy

oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes has led to the
development of many targeted therapeutics for treating
many types of malignancies. At the present time, most
of our understanding about the dysregulated cancer
cell metabolism remains at the “gross” physiological
stages. As technological development advances, we
may eventually be able to differentiate the metabolic
differences between cancerous and normal cells at the
single-tumor level, ultimately leading to the development
of personalized cancer medicine. In this review, we focus
on the recent development of targeted therapy of a subset
of human malignancies with altered Arg metabolism.

Dysregulation of cellular metabolism is a hallmark
of many human malignancies. The metabolic differences
between normal cells and tumor cells have provided
opportunities for developing novel approaches for the
diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The “Warburg effect”
which describes the preferentially metabolizing glucose via
anaerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation
found in many cancers, led to the development of
2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography
[18FDG-PET] as a valuable oncology imaging tool [1].

Arginine-deficiency and auxotrophy in cancer
cells

can be regulated by many extracellular factors. Expression
of hepatic ASS can be transcriptionally regulated by cyclic
AMP [5] and endothelial ASS expression is regulated by
cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-a, and TGF-b1 and glutamate
[6, 7]. Levels of ASS vary markedly in a wide spectrum of
tumor tissues as compared with their corresponding normal
counterparts. Elevated levels of ASS expression have
been found in cancers of the ovary, stomach, and colon.
By contrast, reduced or undetectable levels of ASS have
been found in the majority of melanoma, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), mesotheliomas, renal cell carcinoma,
and prostate cancers [8-11]. The mechanisms that control
ASS expression in these tumor types remain elusive. The
ASS-negative tumors are unable to survive if the systemic
Arg supply is depleted. Therefore, they are auxotrophic
for Arg.

Arg is an intermediate metabolite in the urea cycle.
De novo biosynthesis of Arg requires two sequential
enzymatic steps: argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS)
which catalyzes the synthesis of argininosuccinate from
L-citrulline and aspartic acid, and argininosuccinate
lyase (ASL) which converts argininosuccinate into L-Arg
and fumaric acid (Fig. 1); of which, ASS is the ratelimiting enzyme. Fumarate is an important metabolite of
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, linking Arg metabolism
to glucose-generated energy metabolism. Moreover, Arg
is involved in many other important cellular metabolic
pathways, including the biosyntheses of polyamine,
creatine and nitric oxide, nucleotides, proline and
glutamate biosyntheses [2-4].
In normal cells, ASS is a ubiquitous enzyme but its
level of expression differs among different cell types and

using ADI-PEG20. Shown in the center are the

coupled TCA and urea cycles. In the urea cycle, arginine is metabolized by arginase to citrulline and urea. Arginine can be metabolized into citrulline and nitric oxide (NO) by nitroxide synthetase (NOS). Citrulline is converted into argininosuccinate (AS) by argininosuccinate synthetase
(ASS). AS is recycled back to arginine by argininosuccinate lyase. In most melanoma cells, AS is not active, therefore, arginine must come from
an external source. Treating melanoma cells with arginine deiminase (ADI), which converts arginine to citrulline and ammonia, results in arginine
deprivation, leading to cell death in melanoma cells. We found that ASS expression can be induced in some melanoma cells involving the interplay
of c-Myc/HIF-1a/Sp4. The relationships of this metabolic wiring and the function of HIF-1a and c-Myc are also indicated.

Targeted therapy of ASS-negative cancers with
arginine-degrading enzymes

Mechanisms of cell killing in targeted therapy
of L-Arg auxotrophic cancer cells by argininedepleting enzymes

Two recombinant proteins that degrade Arg have been
under development for treating Arg auxotropic tumors:
ADI and arginase. ADI catabolizes the conversion of
arginine to citrulline and ammonia; and arginase degrades
arginine to ornithine which is then converted to citrulline
by ornithine carbamoyl transferase (OCT), an additional
step for arginine-to-citrulline conversion (Fig. 1).
ADI is a bacterial enzyme secreted from Mycoplasma
spp. into cultures. Sugimura et al [12] were the first to
identify that ADI from M. arginini is a lymphoblastogenesis
inhibitory factor. Miyazaki et al [13] reported that ADI
purified from Mycoplasma-derived culture medium
potently inhibits the growth of human tumor cells.
Takaku et al [14] described the in vivo antitumor activity
of ADI in melanoma animal models [15, 16]. However,
because bacterial ADI has short half-life (~ 4 hr) in the
circulation and is highly immunogenic, Holtsberg et al
[17] formulated a pegADI with poly(ethylene glycol)

While amino acid deprivation is known to induce
nutritional starvation, how the depletion of a single amino
acid such as Arg leads to cell death is not well-understood.
ADI-PEG20- or arginase-induced cell death in cultured
cells usually takes 3 to 6 days. However, early events
such as induction of autophagy occurs can be detected 90
min. after the start of treatment [26, 27] and can last for
over 72 hr [28]. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation
pathway which involves vesicular sequestration of
proteins or organelles into autophagasomes which then
fuse with lysosomes and become degraded [29, 30].
Autophagy occurs upon nutrition stress as a means to
protect cells from apoptosis by re-cycle amino acid from
protein degradation. In this regard, global metabolic stress
could be detected in prostate cancer animal model 4 hr
after ADI-PEG20 treatment as measured by 18FDG-PET
[26]. Furthermore, activation of nutrient/energy-sensing
pathway, which involves upregulation of AMPK/mTOR/
S6K, is accompanied with the induction of autophagy
in ASS-negative cells treated with ADI-PEG20. Several
studies have shown that prolonged treatment with ADIPEG20 in cultured cells induces apoptosis [27, 31, 32].
The exposure time that leads to apoptosis and the extent of
apoptosis induced by ADI-PEG20 treatments are different
among melanoma cell lines and may be related to the
antiapoptotic machinery in the cells [27, 33].

of molecular mass of 20,000 Daltons for clinical use,
termed ADI-PEG20. Phase I-II clinical trial in patients

with advanced or metastatic melanoma showed antitumor
activities, including partial and complete responses [18].
A 35% response rate has been seen with minimal toxicity
[19]. Importantly, the response and stable diseases were
only seen in patients with tumors that do not express ASS
(L.F & NS,, unpublished clinical data). Compared with
the poor response rates (<20%) of malignant melanoma
to current standard treatment options [20], ADI-PEG20
represents a novel approach for the targeted therapy of
advanced melanoma. A phase I/IIa trial (n=19) [21] and
a recent phase II trial [22] of ADI-PEG20 for human
HCC showed the effectiveness of HCC treatment. In
these studies, ADI-PEG20 treatment was well tolerated
and effectively reduced serum Arg levels without adverse
effects. However, antigenicity against ADI-PEG20
eventually arose about 50 days after the treatment [22].
The antigenicity associated with ADI-PEG20
treatment has motivated the development of recombinant
human arginase (rhArg1) for targeting Arg auxotrophic
tumors. While arginase is about 1000 times less potent
as compared with ADI under physiologic condition [13],
rhArg1 has also been under development for treating HCC
[23]. Optimal activity for native arginase is at pH ~9.5,
making it less active at physiological pH [24]. hArg1
contains two coordinated Mn2+ ions at its active site.
Replacing Mn2+ with Co2+ coordination in rhArg1 reduces
its pH optimum to pH 7.4 and enhances its cytotoxic
effects (~ 10-fold) to hepatoma cells in culture [25]. Thus,
this bioengineered arginase warrants further clinical study.

Mechanisms of resistance to ADI-PEG20
mediated by the induction of argninosuccinate
synthetase expression
One important finding in our phase I/II melanoma
clinical trial with ADI-PEG20 was that patients who were
initially ASS negative could become ASS positive upon
relapse, suggesting that induction of ASS expression in
tumors is likely to be a mechanism of ADI resistance. To
investigate the induction mechanism of ASS expression
by ADI-PEG20, we used three melanoma cell lines
A2058, SK-MEL-2, and A375. These cell lines express
undetectable levels of ASS. When grown in ADI-PEG20containing medium or Arg-free medium, induction of ASS
expression was seen in A2058 and SK-MEL-2 cells but not
in A375 cells. Induction of ASS expression is associated
with ADI-PEG20 resistance, which can be reversed
when ASS expression is knocked down with siRNA,
suggesting that ASS expression is correlated with ADIPEG20 sensitivity [34]. Further investigation revealed
that the positive transcriptional regulator c-Myc and the
negative transcriptional regulator HIF-1a interacting with
the E-box element located at the promoter of the ASS gene
(34) controls the expression of ASS.
248

Before ADI-PEG20 treatment, HIF-1a binds to the
E-box and silences ASS expression. Upon ADI treatment,
HIF-1a level is rapidly downregulated (t½ ~ 45 min.)
and c-Myc level is upregulated. c-Myc replaces HIF-1a
binding to the promoter of ASS and transactivates the
expression of ASS. No upregulation of c-Myc was found
in ADI-PEG20-treated A375 cells and no switch between
HIF-1a and c-Myc binding was found in A375 cells
upon ADI-PEG20 treatment [34]. ADI-PEG20-resistant
variants were found in A2058 cells and SK-MEL-2 cells
but not in A375 cells. Thus, the inducibility of altered HIF1a and c-Myc expression may be a predictive signal for
the ADI-PEG20 sensitivity of cells as well as the ultimate
development of drug resistance.
The observation that Arg deprivation induces upregulation of c-Myc but down-regulation of HIF-1a
in some melanoma cells but not in others is intriguing.
c-Myc plays a central role in a transcriptional network
that regulates cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and
metabolic signaling [35, 36], and it has been demonstrated
that c-Myc depletion inhibits cell proliferation in many
types of human tumor cells [37]. In melanoma cells,
c-Myc depletion induces senescence reminiscent of
normal melanocytes [38]. Likewise, HIF-1a is also
involved in the regulation of tumor growth, angiogenesis,
and invasion [39]. Given the recent discoveries that c-Myc
and HIF-1a are involved in the regulation of cancer energy
metabolism [40, 41] (Fig. 1), our finding that c-Myc and
HIF-1a have opposite responses to ADI-PEG20 treatment
has important implications beyond the induction of ASS
and ADI-PEG20 sensitivity, it underscores the global
effects on cancer cell energy metabolism as well.

providing a rationale for developing c-Myc- [42] and
HIF-1a- targeting drugs [43] to combat the evolution of
drug resistance. Finally, it remains important to elucidate
the underlying mechanisms by which Arg deprivation
regulates c-Myc and HIF-1a that may have global effect
on cancer metabolism in the Arg auxotrophic cancer cells.
This research may eventually lead to the development of
effective therapeutics for targeting cancer cell metabolism
in general and Arg auxotrophic cancer in particular.

future

Targeted therapy of cancers auxotrophic for Arg
in humans using Arg-degrading enzymes, e.g. ADIPEG20, has been investigated at many cancer centers
and promising results have been obtained. These types of
cancers generally are difficult to treat with conventional
chemotherapeutics. One important aspect of ADI-PEG20
treatment is that patients are well-tolerated because of low
adverse side effects. This finding provides an opportunity
to improve therapeutic efficacy by combining ADIPEG20 with other antitumor agents. Previous studies
have demonstrated that ADI-PEG20 treatment induces
nutritional stress and activation of autophagy response,
leading to cell death. Future development may combine
the use of autophagy-targeting drugs to enhance the
therapeutic effect of ADI-PEG20. Moreover, we have
found that ADI-PEG20 treatment induces ASS reexpression which is associated with the emergence of
ADI-PEG20 resistance. We have demonstrated the roles
of c-Myc and HIF-1a in the regulation of ASS expression,
