Cooperative Phosphorylation of FADD by Aur-A and Plk1 in
Response to Taxol Triggers Both Apoptotic and Necrotic Cell
Death
Moon-Sun Jang1, Su-Jin Lee1, Nam Sook Kang2, and Eunhee Kim1,2,3

Abstract
Administration of the antimitotic chemotherapeutic taxol is known to cause accumulation of the mitotic
kinase Aurora-A (Aur-A). Here, we report that Aur-A phosphorylates S203 of the Fas associated with death
domain protein (FADD) in response to taxol treatment. In addition, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) failed to
phosphorylate the Aur-A–unphosphorylatable FADD substitution mutant S203A, indicating that phosphorylation of S203 by Aur-A serves to prime FADD for Plk1-mediated phosphorylation at S194. The double-phosphorylation-mimicking mutant form of FADD, FADD-S194D/S203D (FADD-DD), recruited caspase-8, activating the
caspase-dependent cell death pathway. FADD-DD also dissociated the cell death protein RIP1 from FADD,
resulting in activation of RIP1 and triggering of caspase-independent cell death. Consistent with its deathpromoting potential, FADD-DD showed robust tumor suppressor activity. However, single-phosphorylationmimicking mutant forms of FADD, FADD-S194D/S203A (FADD-DA) and FADD-S194A/S203D (FADD-AD), were
incapable of carrying out such functions, indicating that double phosphorylation of FADD is critical for the
execution of cell death and tumor suppression. Collectively, our data show the existence of cooperative actions
between Aur-A and Plk1 mitotic kinases in response to taxol, providing a molecular explanation for the action
mechanism of taxol. Cancer Res; 71(23); 7207–15. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Antimitotic drugs comprise several classes of molecules that
kill cancer cells via different cell death pathways (1). Antimitotic drugs such as taxol bind to microtubules and cause
kinetic suppression of microtubule dynamics (2). The consequent cell-cycle arrest at mitotic phases by taxol leads to cell
death. Although the mechanism by which taxol induces cell
death may differ depending on cell type and taxol concentration, both caspase-independent and caspase-dependent pathways are involved (3–7). However, the molecular mechanism
leading from cell-cycle arrest to cell death is not well
understood.
Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Aurora-A kinase (Aur-A) are the
most extensively studied mitotic kinases (8, 9). Plk1 has 2
functional domains: a kinase domain and polo-box domain

(PBD). The PBD mediates recruitment of Plk1 to substrates
that have been phosphorylated a priori by Cdk1, which serves
as a priming kinase (8). Aur-A has a kinase domain in the
C-terminus and an A-box in the N-terminus, which regulates
the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Aur-A (9). Plk1 and
Aur-A are overexpressed in G2-M phases and coregulate
multiple mitotic processes (10). Moreover, enhanced kinase
activity associated with Plk1 and Aur-A overexpression confers
a proliferative advantage in some tumors (11). Therefore,
inhibitors of theses kinases are currently being evaluated for
therapeutic use (11–16). However, the feasibility of using these
kinases as anticancer drug targets is a matter of controversy.
Notably, the incidence of spontaneous tumor formation is
increased in mice with compromised expression of Plk1 and
Aur-A, implying that these kinases possess physiologically
relevant tumor suppressor potential (16–18).
FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) is known
to interact with Fas, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL), and TNF-1, leading to the activation of caspase-8
and subsequent cell death (19–21). Two essential domains
of FADD, the death effector domain (DED) and the death
domain, are involved in this process, regulating apoptosis and
necrosis, respectively (22). FADD is regulated by phosphorylation, and phosphorylated FADD carries out various functions
(23–25). Phosphorylation of FADD at S194, mediated by casein
kinase 1a and Plk1, is required for cells to exit from G2-M
(25, 26). Phosphorylated FADD also has shown death-promoting potential and enhances cellular chemosensitivity to
various chemotherapeutics (23–25), including taxol. Notably,

S194-phosphorylated FADD (FADD-pS194) induces caspaseindependent and caspase-dependent cell death, depending on
the concentration of taxol (25). The association of enhanced
chemosensitivity of tumors with FADD S194 phosphorylation
implies that the absence of phosphorylated FADD confers a
survival advantage to tumor cells and suggests a role for FADD
in the pathophysiology of cancer.
Here, we provide the ﬁrst demonstration that Aur-A
phosphorylates S203 of FADD in response to taxol treatment
and cooperates with Plk1 in the phosphorylation of S194.
Moreover, Aur-A and Plk1 double-phosphorylated FADD
(dP-FADD) induces cell death via activation of caspase-8
and the cell death protein RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein
1) and suppresses tumor formation. These data suggest that
mitotic kinases considered to be oncogenes play a supportive role in taxol chemotherapy. As such, administration of
inhibitors against these kinases should be considered with
care.

Materials and Methods
Vector construction, mutagenesis, and RNA interference
pGEX 4T-1-FADD and pFLAG-FADD construction has been
previously reported (25). FADD mutations were introduced
into pGEX4T-1 or pFLAG vectors using a QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) with appropriate mutagenesis primers. The target sequence 50 -ATGCCCTGTCTTACTGTCA-30
was used to develop speciﬁc siRNA against human Aur-A.
Cell line, treatments, and transfections
All cell lines were cultured in medium containing 10% FBS
(Invitrogen) and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at
37 C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2. HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line), L132 (normal human lung epithelial cell
line), AGS (human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line), and
HCT15 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line) were
purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank. HeLa and L132
were cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium
(WelGENE). AGS and HCT15 were cultured in RPMI 1640
(WelGENE). CFPAC-1 (human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell
line) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
and cultured in RPMI 1640. All of these cell lines were free of
Mycoplasma before start of experiment (Lonza). Taxol and
VX680 were purchased from Sigma and Selleck, respectively.
siRNA was transfected using Nucleofector (Lonza) and plasmid
DNAs were transfected using METAFECTENE (Biontex), as
described by the manufacturers.
Antibodies
Antibodies against the following proteins were purchased
from the indicated sources: Aur-A and FADD (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); FADD-pS194 and caspase-8 (Cell Signaling);
Plk1 (Invitrogen); FLAG (Sigma); RIP1 (BD Biosciences);
and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;
AbFrontier). An antibody against S203-phosphorylated FADD
(FADD-pS203) was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide
corresponding to residues 199–208 of FADD-pS203 and further
puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography (AbFrontier).

Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and
immunoﬂuorescence staining
Cell lysates were incubated with different antibodies, as
indicated in the text, together with A/G-Sepharose beads
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were resolved
by SDS-PAGE, and coimmunoprecipitated proteins were
detected by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining was done as previously
described (27).
In vitro kinase assay
Puriﬁed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Aur-A from Escherichia coli or immunoprecipitated Aur-A from HeLa cells transfected with pFLAG-Aur-A was incubated with puriﬁed GSTFADD mutants in kinase reaction buffer (Aur-A and Plk1 kinase
assays: 20 mmol/L HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1
mmol/L dithiothreitol, 100 mmol/L ATP; RIP1 kinase assay: 20
mmol/L HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 20 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, 20 mmol/L MgCl2,
20 mmol/L MnCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L dithiothreitol,
300 mmol/L ATP) with 1 mCi of [g-32P] ATP at 30 C for 30
minutes. After the reactions were complete, mixtures were
resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Ponceau S,
dried, and subjected to autoradiography.
Cell death assay
Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested and
used for detection of caspase-8 activity; 2.5 mmol/L IETD-AMC
(Peptron) was used as a substrate. Activity was determined by
measuring relative ﬂuorescence intensity using a spectroﬂuorometer (PerkinElmer).
Tumorigenesis assay
HeLa cells transfected with FADD mutants were used for
colony formation and xenograft assays. These assays were
done as previously described (25).

Results
FADD interacts with Aur-A
It is known that FADD expression increases in cancer cells
and tissues treated with anticancer agents (23–25, 28), suggesting that FADD might participate in the action of these agents.
To elucidate the function of FADD in this context, we sought to
identify FADD-interacting proteins in taxol-treated HeLa cells
by incubating full-length GST-FADD with cellular proteins
extracted from taxol-treated HeLa cells. Immunocomplexes
with GST-FADD were analyzed by mass spectrometry (data not
shown). Subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of ﬂight analysis identiﬁed several FADD-interacting
molecules, including Aur-A.
To determine whether this interaction was physiologically
signiﬁcant, we further analyzed the association between FADD
and Aur-A in HeLa cells. Extracts from cells treated with
different concentrations of taxol or left untreated were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FADD antibody
followed by Western blotting with Aur-A. An endogenous
FADD–Aur-A complex was clearly detected in taxol-treated

HeLa cells, but not in untreated cells (Fig. 1A and B). Moreover,
we detected colocalization of FADD and Aur-A in taxol-treated
HeLa cells, but not in untreated cells (Fig. 1C). Concordant
physical interactions between FADD and Aur-A upon taxol
treatment were also observed in other cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Taken together, our data indicated that cellular
complexes between FADD and Aur-A are formed upon taxol
treatment, but not under unstimulated conditions.
To determine the domain(s) responsible for FADD–Aur-A
interactions, we incubated GST-FADD with in vitro–translated
truncated mutants of Aur-A. As shown in Fig. 1D, a region
including the kinase domain of Aur-A (amino acids 133–403)
interacted with FADD, whereas the N-terminus (amino acids
1–133) of Aur-A did not. These data suggest that FADD might
be a substrate of Aur-A.
Aur-A phosphorylates FADD at S203 in vitro and in cells
To determine whether FADD is an authentic substrate of
Aur-A, we incubated puriﬁed GST-FADD with immunoprecipitated FLAG-Aur-A WT (wild type) or KD (kinase dead) in the
presence of [g 32P]ATP. FADD was phosphorylated by Aur-AWT, but not by Aur-A-KD (Fig. 2A). Next, we substituted
alanine for serine at S194, previously reported as the site of
FADD phosphorylation by Plk1, generating the FADD substitution mutant, FADD-S194A (24). FADD-S194A was phosphorylated by Aur-A (Fig. 2B), indicating that S194 is not the Aur-A
phosphorylation site. We next considered the S203 residue as a
potential phosphorylation site for Aur-A. Although S203 is not

located within a consensus motif for Aur-A substrates (R/K-XS/T-L/I/V), it is embedded in a consensus Plk1 motif (D/E-X-S/
T-j; ref. 29) that is not phosphorylated by Plk1. An alaninesubstituted S203 mutant FADD (FADD-S203A) was not phosphorylated by Aur-A (Fig. 2B), indicating that S203 is the FADD
residue phosphorylated by Aur-A, despite its atypical (for AurA) sequence context.
To conﬁrm the phosphorylation of S203 in cells, we generated an antibody speciﬁc for S203-phosphorylated FADD
(FADD-pS203). A series of control experiments were done to
characterize the speciﬁcity of this antibody (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Both S194 and S203 phosphorylation were eradicated
in lysates treated with l-protein phosphatase (l-PPase), indicating that both sites are authentic phosphorylation sites in
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, phosphorylation of
S203 was inhibited in Aur-A knockdown cells generated by
treatment with Aur-A speciﬁc siRNA (Fig. 2C) and was significantly suppressed by treatment with the Aur-A inhibitor
VX680 (Fig. 2D), which showed speciﬁc, potent activity against
Aur-A kinase in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken together,
these results indicate that Aur-A phosphorylates FADD at S203.
Phosphorylation of FADD at S194 requires a priming
phosphorylation of S203
Next, we examined whether phosphorylation of S203 by AurA has any functional relevance to S194 phosphorylation by
Plk1. Upon taxol treatment, Aur-A expression was observed to
increase prior to that of Plk1 (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this

Figure 2. Aur-A phosphorylates FADD at S203. A, lysates from HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-Aur-A-WT (wild-type) or -KD (kinase-dead) were
immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting immunocomplexes were incubated with either puriﬁed GST or GST-FADD in the presence

Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized as described above. C, HeLa cells were depleted of Aur-A with siRNA, treated with taxol (1 mmol/L), and
subjected to Western blot analysis. The phosphorylation status of FADD-S194 and FADD-S203 was detected using antibodies speciﬁc for FADD-pS194 and
FADD-pS203, respectively. D, untreated (Unt) HeLa cells or cells pretreated with dimethyl sulfoxide (Veh) or VX680 (3 mmol/L) were incubated with

observation, FADD-pS203 accumulated as early as 1 hour after
taxol treatment. In contrast, FADD-pS194 was detected much
later, showing that phosphorylation of S203 precedes that of
S194. Interestingly, knockdown and inhibition of Aur-A not
only reduced the phosphorylation of S203, it also decreased
S194 phosphorylation, suggesting a functional link between
these two events (Fig. 2C and D). Considering that Plk1 often
requires a priming phosphorylation (30), we examined whether
phosphorylation of S203 affected that of S194. Phosphorylation
of S203 was not affected by the phosphorylation status of S194
(Fig. 3B, left). However, phosphorylation of S194 required prior
S203 phosphorylation, indicating that phosphorylation of S203
is a prerequisite for S194 phosphorylation in FADD (Fig. 3B,
right). To further conﬁrm the requirement for S203 phosphorylation, we preincubated puriﬁed GST-FADD, with or without
Aur-A in the presence of unlabeled ATP, and then incubated
with or without Plk1, followed by Western blotting using
antibodies speciﬁc for FADD-pS194 or FADD-pS203. Puriﬁed
FADD pretreated with Aur-A was strongly phosphorylated by
Plk1. However, phosphorylation at S194 was signiﬁcantly
attenuated in the absence of Aur-A pretreatment (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, phosphorylation of S194 was strongly enhanced

in cells transfected with FADD-S203D compared with that in
cells transfected with FADD-S203A (Fig. 3D). To extend these
observations, we examined whether the interaction between
Plk1 and FADD was dependent on the phosphorylation status
of S203. In pull-down experiments, FADD-WT coprecipitated
with GST-Plk1-PBD, but FADD-S203A was not, indicating that
the phosphorylation status of S203 determined the interaction
of these two proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Next, we used computer modeling to examine whether
structural changes associated with phosphorylation of S203
affected phosphorylation of S194. The partial solution structure of FADD has been solved and deposited as entry 2GF5 in a
protein databank (21); however, the phosphorylation sites S194
and S203 were not deﬁned in 2GF5. To obtain the full 3dimensional (3D) structure of FADD, including phosphorylation sites, we adopted a hierarchical protein structure modeling approach based on secondary structure, enhanced Proﬁle–
Proﬁle threading Alignment, and the iterative implementation
of the Threading ASSEmbly Reﬁnement program (31, 32).
Using this approach, we obtained a candidate model for the
full 3D structure of human FADD and then carried out molecular dynamics simulations using CHARMM force ﬁeld (ref. 33;

phosphorylation by phosphorylation of S203. In contrast,
phosphorylation at S194 predicted no modiﬁcation of S203,
as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. Collectively, these data
showed that FADD-S203 must be phosphorylated for the
subsequent phosphorylation of S194.

dP-FADD is required for the induction of cell death
The requirement for FADD phosphorylation at S194 for cell
death has been previously described (23–25). Here, we studied
whether the newly identiﬁed relationship between phosphorylation of FADD at S203 and phosphorylation at S194 is
functionally relevant in the context of cell death. To address
this, we transfected HeLa cells with various FADD mutants and
examined downstream events involved in the cell death pathway. First, because FADD can induce cell death via recruitment
of caspase-8, we examined the interaction of FADD mutants
S194A/S203A (FADD-AA), S194D/S203D (FADD-DD), S194D/
S203A (FADD-DA), and S194A/S203D (FADD-AD) with caspase-8. As shown in Fig. 5A, the FADD-DD mutant mimicking
dP-FADD at S194 and S203 interacted strongly with caspase-8,
whereas the phosphorylation-defective FADD-AA mutant and
FADD-DA and FADD-AD mutants mimicking singly phosphorylated FADD (sP-FADD) did not. Second, we examined whether
dP-FADD affected caspase-8–mediated DEF (death effector
ﬁlament) formation (34). FLAG-tagged FADD mutants were
transfected into HeLa cells with pEGFP–caspase-8 DEDs.

FADD-DD strongly induced caspase-8–mediated DEF formation, whereas unphosphorylated FADD or mutants mimicking
sP-FADD did not (Supplementary Fig. S6). Furthermore,
FADD-DD induced cell death via activation of caspase-8 and
caspase-3 (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S7), implying that dPFADD induces caspase-mediated cell death. FADD also plays
an important role in the necrotic branch of cell death (22). To
determine whether RIP1 is activated by dP-FADD, we transfected HeLa cells with FLAG-tagged FADD mutants. Fortyeight hours after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG or anti-RIP1 antibody, followed by
Western blotting with an anti-RIP1 antibody (Fig. 5C) or kinase
assays (Fig. 5D). As shown in Fig. 5C and D, FADD-DD
dissociated RIP1 from FADD and induced activation of RIP1,
whereas mutants mimicking unphosphorylated FADD (FADDAA) or sP-FADD (FADD-DA and FADD-AD) did not. Such
requirement of double phosphorylation for cell death was
conﬁrmed in various cells including HeLa (Supplementary Fig.
S8). Collectively, these data showed that double phosphorylation is a critical phenomenon for both apoptosis and necrosis.
Phosphorylation of FADD at S194 increases the sensitivity of
tumor cells to taxol (24). Therefore, we were curious whether
FADD S203 also confers to the chemosensitivity to taxol.
Sensitivity of HeLa cells to taxol was decreased when treated
with BI2536 (Plk1 inhibitor) and VX680 (Aur-A inhibitor),
implying that phosphorylations of FADD at S194 and S203 by

Plk1 and Aur-A are important in taxol-induced cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S9). Next, we examined whether taxolinduced cell death is mediated via activation of caspase-8 and
RIP1. When we treated HeLa cells with necrostatin-1 (RIP1
inhibitor) and z-IETD-fmk (caspase-8 inhibitor), taxol-induced
cell death was completely abolished, indicating that taxolinduced cell death requires activation of caspase-8 and RIP1
(Supplementary Fig. S10).
FADD serves as an adaptor in the extrinsic cell death
pathway (19–21). To determine whether phosphorylation of
FADD is involved in the receptor-mediated cell death, FADDnegative Jurkat cells (FADDdef) were transfected with FADDDD or FADD-AA and subsequently treated with TRAIL. Reconstituted cells were equally sensitive to TRAIL-mediated cell
death (Supplementary Fig. S11). Moreover, treatment of VX680
did not block the TRAIL-induce cell death (Supplementary Fig.
S12). Collectively, our data indicated that phosphorylation of
FADD does not contribute to TRAIL-mediated cell death.
These ﬁndings were consistent with the previous study reporting that phosphorylation of FADD was irrelevant in Fasmediated cell death (35).
dP-FADD suppresses tumor formation
We previously showed that FADD-pS194 inhibits Plk1-mediated tumor formation (25). Here, we compared the tumor
suppressor activities of sP-FADD and dP-FADD by expressing

Cooperative Phosphorylation of FADD by Aur-A and Plk1

Discussion
This study identiﬁed S203 as a novel phosphorylation site of
FADD, in addition to the previously identiﬁed S194 site, and
describes the implication of this phosphorylation. Moreover,
we report that FADD is double phosphorylated by the sequential action of Aur-A and Plk1 upon taxol treatment and show
that dP-FADD activates both caspase-dependent and caspaseindependent pathways, leading to cell death. In addition,
dP-FADD successfully suppressed tumor formation, whereas
sP-FADD did not. Therefore, our data indicate that the

cooperative action of the two mitotic kinases Aur-A and Plk1
is essential for endowing the death-promoting and tumor
suppressor functions of FADD.
Plk1 binds to phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-containing peptides through its PBD (36). Sequential phosphorylation
of substrates, including vimentin, BubR1, Cep55, and Bora, by
Cdk1 and Plk1 have been reported (37–40), where Cdk1 serves a
common priming kinase function that facilitates subsequent
interactions between substrates and Plk1 (8). However, Cdk1
does not phosphorylate FADD (26). In this study, we found that
Aur-A serves as a priming kinase for subsequent phosphorylation of FADD by Plk1, adding FADD to the list of Plk1
substrates that require a priming kinase. Such a cooperative
phosphorylation by Aur-A and Plk1 has not previously been
reported. Kif2a, Bora, and p150glued are also phosphorylated by
Aur-A and Plk1; however, cooperative phosphorylation has not
been shown (41–44). Therefore, this study presents a novel
regulatory mechanism involving the action of Aur-A and Plk1
upon their common substrate, FADD.
Phosphorylation by Aur-A confers a "gain of function" to
FADD. If phosphorylation of S203 played only a priming role for
subsequent phosphorylation of S194, overexpression of FADDDA or FADD-DD should yield equivalent phenotypes. However,
overexpression of FADD-DD potently killed cells and suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo, whereas overexpression of
FADD-DA did not. This indicates that phosphorylation of
FADD at S203 by Aur-A has other effects in addition to its
role in priming FADD for subsequent action by Plk1. Structural
changes in FADD induced by sequential phosphorylation
events seemed to affect its interactions with other proteins.
Unphosphorylated FADD and sP-FADD remained bound to
RIP1, whereas dP-FADD dissociated RIP1 and recruited caspase-8. This provides a molecular explanation for the selective
death potential of dP-FADD. It is well known that recruitment
of caspase-8 to FADD leads the activation of caspase-8. However, the RIP1 activating mechanism coupled with its

FLAG-tagged mutants of FADD in HeLa cells and then analyzing in vitro colony formation and in vivo tumorigenesis. In
the in vitro colony-formation assay, transfection of FADD-DD
signiﬁcantly inhibited cell growth compared with transfection
of FADD-AA, FADD-DA, FADD-AD, or empty vector (MOCK).
This indicates that dP-FADD regulated cell growth more
efﬁciently than sP-FADD and unphosphorylated FADD
(Fig. 6A). Next, we analyzed the effects of FADD mutants on
inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice. HeLa cells overexpressing FADD mutants (2  106 cells per mouse) were
injected into 5-week-old nude mice; 5 weeks later, the tumors
formed in these mice were dissected for measurement of tumor
size (Fig. 6B, left). Tumor growth was signiﬁcantly inhibited in
mice injected with HeLa cells transfected with FADD-DD
compared with those transfected with FADD-AA, FADD-DA,
FADD-AD, or MOCK (Fig. 6B). This implied that sP-FADD is not
sufﬁcient to suppress tumor growth. Therefore, we speculated
that the previously reported tumor suppressor activity of
FADD-pS194, which would have included both dP-FADD and
singly phosphorylated FADD-pS194 forms (i.e., not phosphorylated at S203), is actually attributable to dP-FADD (25).
Moreover, our computer modeling suggested that the possibility that singly phosphorylated FADD-pS194 exists in cells
would be low.

dissociation from dP-FADD has yet to be clariﬁed. It would be
interesting to examine whether interaction of RIP1 with RIP3, a
RIP1 kinase, increases upon dissociation of RIP1 from dPFADD. FADD has been considered to function as a selective
molecular switch that governs apoptotic versus and necrotic
outcomes (22). However, our data show that dP-FADD activates both types of cell death, implying that dP-FADD is a
powerful weapon in the cell-death arsenal.
The functions of Plk1 and Aur-A are a matter of controversy. These kinases are overexpressed in various human
cancers, and their high levels of expression are associated
with poor prognosis (45, 46). These kinases are considered
oncogenes, and many pharmaceutical companies are developing cancer drugs based on inhibition of their catalytic
functions (47). However, data with the opposite implication
have also been reported. Overexpression of Plk1 suppresses
cell proliferation and mutations causing inactivation of
Aur-A increase the risk of developing cancer (17, 18, 48).
The data presented here also show that increased activities
of Plk1 and Aur-A endow FADD with death-promoting and
tumor suppressor functions.
In our view, administering inhibitors of Aur-A and Plk1 to
cancer patients with uncompromised expression of FADD
might not be appropriate because this would prevent dual
phosphorylation of FADD. Instead, we think that drugs that
induce accumulation of Aur-A and Plk1, such as taxol, might be

of beneﬁt to these patients. Further studies will ultimately be
required to clarify whether sacriﬁcing the death potential of
dP-FADD is ultimately beneﬁcial to such patients. Our data do
suggest, however, that inhibitors of Plk1 and Aur-A might be
useful for cancer patients with low-level expression of FADD.
Therefore, the expression level of FADD in cancer patients
might serve as a decisive parameter for determining which type
of chemotherapeutics should be administered.
