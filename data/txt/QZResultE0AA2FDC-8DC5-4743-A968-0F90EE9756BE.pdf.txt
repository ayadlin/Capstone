ABSTRACT
Membrane protein claudin3 has been recently suggested as a marker for
biologically aggressive tumors and a possible target for the therapeutic delivery of
active anti-cancer compounds. Claudin3-binding molecules such as the Clostridium
perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), CPE-related molecules, and murine and chimeric
antibodies have shown promising antitumor efficacy in preclinical oncological settings.
We first engineered a fully human anti-claudin3 IgG1 antibody (IgGH6) by fusing
the human IgG1 Fc-domain to the anti-claudin3 scFvH6 previously isolated from
a pre-immune phage display library. The construct was expressed in mammalian
cells and specifically targeted claudin3 endogenously expressed on the surface of
different human ovarian cancer cell lines. No detectable cross-reactivity with other
homologous claudins was observed. The epitope recognized by IgGH6 is located
within the minor extracellular domain of claudin3 and becomes accessible only in
tumor cells characterized by incomplete junction formation. Confocal microscopy
experiments demonstrated that IgGH6 was actively internalized in tumor cells after
binding to native claudin3 and co-localized, likely within intracellular vesicles, with
the C-CPE peptide. Preliminary results indicate that IgGH6 accumulated in vivo in free
claudin3 ovarian carcinoma xenografts. For its selective uptake in tumor cells and its
human nature, IgGH6 represents a valuable candidate for antibody-drug conjugate
therapeutic applications in ovarian cancer patients.

the role of claudin in cancer progression has not been
completely elucidated and seems to differ in human
tumors of different origin. For example, the up-regulation
of claudin3 and 4 correlates with the progression of
endometrial carcinoma [3], while the reduced expression
of claudin1 with poor survival in stage II of colon cancer
[4]. Furthermore, claudin4 overexpression inversely
correlated with the metastatic potential of pancreatic

INTRODUCTION
Claudins form a family of 24 transmembrane
proteins that are major constituents of tight junction (TJ)
complexes located at the apical end of the lateral surface
of polarized epithelia. Although it is well established
that claudin expression or subcellular localization is
deregulated in a variety of human malignances [1, 2],

cancer cells but positively with the invasiveness of ovarian
carcinoma cells [5–6].
Loss of TJ integrity leads to cell polarity impairment
and increased influx of growth factors, a condition
suspected to favor tumor cells survival and motility [6, 7].
In particular, claudin3 basal expression is low in normal
epithelial cells, but the protein accumulates at the cell
surface of several biologically aggressive human cancers,
including breast, prostate, pancreatic, and epithelial
ovarian tumors [8, 9]. The loss of cellular polarity and
cell-cell interaction which occurs in cells during neoplastic
transformation leads to the exposure of TJ components
on the cell surface, making claudin3 accessible to
extracellular antibody binding (“free” claudin3) [10]. Due
to its differential overexpression and accessibility in a
variety of human tumors, claudin3 might represent both
a diagnostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target
for drug delivery.
Over the years, molecules that specifically recognize
the extracellular domain of claudins have been identified
and characterized. In oncological settings, the Clostridium
perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and the CPE-related
peptides have been recently validated in vitro and in
animal models of human cancer [11] as tumor inhibitors.
CPE specifically targets the minor extracellular domain
(ECL2) of claudin3 and claudin4 and strongly inhibits
uterine and ovarian serous carcinoma cell growth [12].
Accordingly, Cocco et al. recently described the use of
the CPE peptide as a potential carrier for the delivery
of anti-tumor drugs and as an imaging agent in ovarian
carcinomas [13]. Unfortunately, the non-human origin
of CPE and its significant toxicity when administered
systemically as full length protein will limit its use to local
treatments [11–14].
Antibodies represent a valuable treatment option
for the specific targeting of claudin overexpressing
malignancies. A murine-human chimeric mAb against the
large extracellular domain of claudin4 [15] and a chimeric
dual-targeting mAb against claudin3 and claudin4 [16]
have been recently developed and evaluated for their
antitumor activity. These reagents demonstrated a dosedependent ADCC on pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells
supporting the anti-cancer therapeutic potential of anticlaudin antibodies. Also antibody-drug conjugates (ADC),
with over 30 ADCs currently in clinical development, are
valuable tools for cancer therapy. FDA approved recently
two products, the CD30-targeting ADC brentuximabvedotin for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma
and of anaplastic large cell lymphoma [17], and adotrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for the treatment of
HER2/neu-positive metastatic endometrial cancer [18].
Because of its selective accumulation in tumor
cells, free claudin3 can represent an interesting cancer
biomarker for targeted delivery of toxic drugs such ADCs
administered systemically. This strategy is difficult to
implement due to the difficulty to obtain antibodies against
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a specific claudin by classical immunization approaches
because of the high homology of claudin sequences in
human and among species. We had already isolated and
characterized a human single-chain antibody (scFv) from
the antibody phage display library ETH2-Gold [19],
identified as scFvH6, which specifically targets the minor
extracellular domain of claudin3 [20]. In this work we
have first reconstituted the anti-claudin3 scFvH6 fragment
into a complete fully human IgGH6 antibody, then
evaluated the IgGH6 tumor-binding properties in multiple
in vitro assays on primary ovarian and uterine cancer cell
lines, and finally demonstrated its capacity to bind in vivo
to xenograft mouse models of ovarian cancer.

RESULTS
Engineering, production, and validation of anticlaudin3 human IgGH6
The sequences corresponding to the VH and VL
regions encoding for the scFvH6 [20] were re-cloned
separately in the pFUSE-CHIg-hG1 and pFUSE2-CLIg-hk
eukaryotic expression vectors for reconstituting a full-size
human antibody (IgGH6). The IgG1 isotype was chosen
due to its superior in vitro cytotoxicity and proven efficacy
in clinical trials [21]. IgGH6 was produced in CHO cells
to obtain antibodies with human-like post-translational
modifications. Its production was assessed regularly
after transfection and maximal yields were obtained
after 6–7 days (data not shown). Following protein A
affinity chromatography, 40 μg of purified antibody were
recovered from 250 mL of culture supernatant. The correct
molecular weight and IgGH6 integrity were endorsed by
SDS-PAGE performed under reducing and non-reducing
condition followed by Coomassie blue staining that
showed that IgGH6 purity was above 95% (Figure 1A).
The generation of full-size antibody was confirmed by
Western Blot analysis that identified the two bands of
50 kDa and 28 kDa correspondent to the IgG H and L
chains (Figure 1B). The binding capacity of the engineered
IgGH6 construct towards its antigen was confirmed by
surface plasmon resonance measurements. Since claudin3
is expressed at high density at the surface of ovarian tumor
cells, we preferred measuring avidity rather than affinity
to mimic the in situ actual conditions. Specifically, the
avidity of the bivalent antibody for the peptide 2CL3
encompassing the claudin3 minor extracellular domain was
of 15.3 nmol/L (kon = 1.06 × 105 1/Ms; koff = 1.62 × 10−3 1/s,
Supplementary Figure 1).
The specificity of IgGH6 for claudin3 was evaluated
by ELISA using the peptides corresponding to the
conserved minor extracellular domains of claudin3, 4,
and 7 (Table 1). As shown in Figure 2, IgGH6 retained
the target specificity encoded by the original scFvH6 and
exhibited high selectivity towards the desired antigen with
negligible cross-reactivity to homologous claudins [22].

on the cell membrane

higher levels than in UCI-107, whereas no evidence of
claudin3 presence was observed in TJ-free HEK293
control cell line. Similar results were obtained by FACS
analysis using the commercial antibody. Specifically,
91–98% of USPC-4 and OSPC-2 cells expressed claudin3
with a MFI of 5.87 and 10.54 on positive cells respectively,
while only 34% of UCI-107 expressed claudin3 with a MFI
of 2.43 (Figure 3C). These cell lines were gently detached
with EDTA to preserve membrane integrity and avoid false
positivity due to mechanical damage before being used to
assess the IgGH6 ability to bind the extracellular domain
of claudin3. Cells were incubated 1 hour with 2.5 μg/mL
of purified IgGH6 followed by 30 min incubation with
mouse anti-human IgG-FITC secondary antibody before
FACS analysis. Cells with damaged membrane labeled
with Annexin V were excluded from the analysis.
Figure 3D shows that 47%, 49% and 12% of USPC-2,
OSPC-4, and UCI-107 cells, respectively, were recognized
by IgGH6. The mean of fluorescence of USPC-4, OSPC-2
and UCI-107 was 53, 43 and 16, respectively, consistent
with the different claudin3 accumulation at the surface
of these cells. HEK293 cells with no detectable claudin3
accumulation served as a negative control and did not
show any significant shift in FACS histogram.

Immunofluoresence microscopy was used to
visualize the interaction mechanisms between IgGH6
and claudin3 on cell membranes. When USPC-4 cells
were incubated at 4°C to prevent receptor internalization,
IgGH6 localized at the cell surface, as demonstrated by the
specific staining that was restricted to foci present along
the whole cell margins (Figure 4). The pictures clearly
indicate that the accumulation of claudin3 in OSPC-2
is not localized in cell-cell contact regions, as typically
observed for TJ proteins as claudins in healthy tissues, but
appears also in the upper portion of the cell membrane,
proving the mislocalization of claudin3 in ovarian tumor
cells [23].
When cells were incubated 1 hour at 37°C,
the orthogonal reconstruction of images relative to
OSPC-2 (Figure 5) and USPC-4 (Supplementary Figure 2)
reveals intense intracellular fluorescence signal localized
in spots resembling endosomal vesicles. The carboxyterminal fragment (C-CPE290–319 peptide) of Clostridium
perfringens enterotoxin is known to gradually internalize
into the cytoplasm of claudin3 and claudin4 positive

DISCUSSION

ovarian cancer cells after binding to the minor extracellular
domain of the claudins [13]. We hypothesized a similar
mechanism for the IgGH6 uptake and, consequently,
incubated 1 hour at 37°C OSPC-2 cells in the presence
of both FITC conjugated C-CPE290–319 peptide and
IgGH6. As shown in Figure 6, the two claudin3 binders
show a strong co-localization inside the cells suggesting
that the antibody undergoes the same claudin3-mediate
internalization process previously described for the C-CPE
peptide [14].

The possibility of targeting specifically neoplastic
cells while sparing healthy tissues would significantly
improve the tollerability of anti-cancer therapies and,
accordingly, there is an enormous interest in identifying
biomarkers and reagents suitable for selective drug
delivery. Claudin3 has recently emerged as a potential
cancer biomarker as a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic
target [8, 12] because it is over-expressed selectively in
several biologically aggressive human tumors. Our group
has already described the feasibility to target aggressive
gynecologic cancers with claudin3- and 4-binding
CPE [13, 25]. The molecular mechanism of the CPEclaudin3 interaction has been extensively investigated and
allowed for the identification of the minor extracellular
domain as the sequence motif involved in the CPE
binding [26]. Unfortunately, the CPE toxicity prevents its
systemic administration in human patients, whereas the
development of novel and nontoxic analogues specific for
claudin3 would be highly desirable.
Recently, our group isolated a recombinant
antibody fragment (scFvH6) specific to the ECL2 domain
of claudin3 using a synthetic human phage display
library [20]. Given the promising results obtained with
anti-claudin3 murine and chimeric antibodies used for

IgGH6 in vivo specific targeting of free claudin3
tumors
To assess whether IgGH6 was able to localize to
free claudin3-overexpressing ovarian cancer in vivo,
sub-cutaneous OSPC-ARK-1-derived xenografts were
generated as previously described [24]. Four weeks after
tumor implantation, 20 μg of IgGH6 labeled with the
Near InfraRed dye 790-I were injected intravenously and
6 hours later tumors were excised and visualized using
an In Vivo FX PRO system. Strong fluorescent signal was
observed in tumors excised from animals injected with
IgGH6–790-I, while negligible staining was detected
in tumors excised from vehicle-injected control mice
(Figure 7, IR, merge and camera pictures).

ADCC [15, 16], we developed a full human functional
IgG reagent (IgGH6) starting from the original scFvH6
fragment molecule that conserved the original selective
binding characteristics for the claudin3 expressed at the
surface of ovarian cancer cells.
Extracellular domains of claudins are involved in
the formation of TJ, in which they interact in homotypic
and heterotypic manner [27]. Whereas in normal
confluent epithelial cell monolayer claudin3 is expected
to localize within the TJ strand at the apical site of the
lateral membrane, the known dis-regulation of the mitotic
spindles during epithelial tumorigenesis and the resulting
out-of-plane division in tumor cells was suspected to
induce abnormal localization of TJ components at the cell
surface [28]. However, the detection of “free” claudins,
and specifically of claudin3, in such tumor cells has
been difficult to assess in the past because of the lack of
commercially available antibodies specific for claudin
extracellular domains. In the present study, the IgGH6immunofluorescence of USPC-4 and OSPC-2 cancer
cell lines clearly demonstrated scattered focal claudin3
expression along the whole cell membrane, instead of
the physiological distribution pattern of healthy cells in
which the protein is strictly localized at TJ. Our results
are in agreement with those of Winkler et al. [26] who
demonstrated that CPE binds to the free domain of claudin3
that is not occupied by trans-interaction with homologous
claudins and is not incorporated in TJ strands. Summarizing,
the collected data underline two issues that are critical for
the therapeutic potential of IgGH6: i) in cancer cell lines
this fully human antibody reacted exclusively with claudin3
not engaged in forming TJ; ii) this form of free claudin is a
specific biomarker for ovarian cancer cells.
In principle, the focal expression of the target
antigen on cancer cell surface may diminish the antitumor efficacy of an antibody designed for ADCC therapy
because of the limited number of targetable molecules.
However, the very specific accumulation of the IgGH6targetable, accessible free claudin3 only in cancer cells
and its absence in healthy, polarized epithelial cells
would represent ultimately a major advantage for ADC
[29] because selectivity for the tumor cells and minimal
toxicity are the most relevant requisites for this therapeutic
approach. Also the confocal microscopy experiments
that demonstrated the fast and effective internalization
of IgGH6 in OSPC-2 and USPC-4 cells favor the use of
this antibody for ADC [30, 31] rather than for ADCC that
requires the stable binding of the antibody to the external
surface of the target cells. Remarkably we have also shown
that IgGH6 accumulates in vivo in xenograft models of free
claudin3-expressing ovarian cancer following systemic
administration. Tumor explanted 6 hrs after IgGH6–790-I
injection was strongly fluorescent, while untreated tumor
tissues did not show any detectable signal.
In contrast to the already available anti-claudin
murine and chimeric antibodies [15, 16], the human nature
of IgGH6 would minimize immune reactions that could
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prevent the treatment iteration. To our knowledge, this is the
first human antibody which specifically targets the minor
extracellular domain of the tumor-associated claudin3.
Now that the binding and interalization kinetics
of IgGH6 have been thorughly characterized, we plan
its fusion to active toxins and the in vivo experiments
necessary to identify the optimal treatment conditions and
to validate the therapeutic potential of IgGH6-based ADC
reagents to use against claudin3-expressing malignancies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cancer cell lines and cell culture
Primary ovarian serous carcinoma cell line
OSPC-2 and chemotherapy-resistant primary ovarian
serous papillary carcinoma cell line OSPC-ARK1
were established from samples obtained, respectively,
at the time of primary surgery or collected at the time
of tumor recurrence from a patient harboring stage
IV OSPC. Primary uterine serous carcinoma cell line
USPC-4 was established from samples collected at
the time of tumor recurrence from an intra-abdominal
metastatic site. Primary cell lines and ovarian carcinoma
cell line UCI-107 were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2
in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
HEK293 cells, free of endogenous claudins and of
TJ strands [32] were evaluated as a negative control.
HEK293 were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium) supplemented with 10% FBS. Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, cultured in suspension
(1 × 105 cells/mL) in CD-CHO medium (GIBCO, Life
Technologies) supplemented with L-Glutamine 8 mM and
HT Supplement, were incubated at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 on an orbital shaker platform.

Quantification of claudin3 mRNA by
real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent
(Life Technologies) and treated with TURBO DNase
enzyme (Ambion, Applied Biosystems) to remove the
contaminating DNA eventually present. First-strand cDNA
was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase
(Life Technologies) and q-PCR performed with an
ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). 25 ng
of cDNA were amplified by using the TaqMan Universal
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The comparative
threshold cycle (Ct) method was used to determine gene
expression in each sample relative to the value observed
in HEK293 cells. The mRNA expression levels of target
genes were normalized to the levels of GAPDH transcript.
The primers for claudin3 were obtained from Applied
Biosystems as Assay-on-Demand products. Assay ID
were Hs00265816_s1 (claudin3) and Hs99999905_m1
(GAPDH).

antibody (Sigma Chemical Company). Color reaction
was performed in the presence of soluble BM blue POD
substrate (Roche Diagnostics) and was stopped by the
addition of 1 M sulfuric acid before plate reading at
450nm. IgGH6 was purified from CHO supernatants
using Protein A. Briefly, supernantant was loaded onto
a 1-mL Protein A Sepharose Fast Flow resin packed in
a chromatography column (BioRad Laboratories). The
column was extensively washed with 20 mM sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 9. Bound antibodies were eluted
with 0.1 M citric acid, neutralized with 100 mM Tris-HCl,
pH9, and concentrated on Amicon-Ultra 10K cartridges
(Amicon). Protein A-purified IgGH6 fractions were
separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie
blue staining. IgGH6 heavy and light chains were
simultaneously detected in a Western Blot assay with a
biotin-conjugated polyclonal antibody against human
IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) coupled
with HRP-conjugated streptavidin, and immunoreactions
developed by a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL;
Amersham Biosciences Corp.).

The VH region encoding scFvH6 was PCRamplified using the reverse primer H6-VH-Rev
(GCTAGCACTCGAGACGGTGACCAGGGTTCC,
corresponding to downstream VH sequence, with
the underlined internal NheI restriction enzyme
site) and the forward primer IL2-H6-VH-Fw
(CTCGAGatgtacaggatgcaactcctgtcttgcattgcactaagtcttgcac

taining the IL2 signal peptide sequence (lowercase) in

an internal XhoI restriction enzyme site (underlined). The
PCR product was digested with NheI and XhoI before
being inserted into the expression vector pFUSE-CHIghG1 (InvivoGen), featuring the constant region of the
human IgG1 heavy chain, predigested with the same
enzymes.
The VL scFvH6 domain was PCR amplified using
the reverse primer H6-VL-Rev (CGTACGTTTGATTT
CCACCTTGGTCCCTTG, corresponding to downstream
VL sequence, with the underlined internal BsiWI restriction
enzyme site) and the forward primer IL2-H6-VL-Fw
(ACCGGTatgtacaggatgcaactcctgtcttgcattgcactaagtcttg
cacttgtcacgaattcgGAAATTGTGTTGACGCAGTCT
containing the IL2 signal peptide sequence (lowercase)
in frame with the upstream VL sequence (uppercase)
and an internal AgeI restriction enzyme site (underlined).
The VL PCR product was digested with BsiWI and AgeI
and cloned into the expression vector pFUSE2-CLIg-hk
(InvivoGen), featuring the constant region of the human
immunoglobulin kappa light chain, predigested with the
same enzymes. The two final resulting constructs, named
pFUSE-H6VH and pFUSE-H6VL, were then expressed
in CHO cells and secreted into the medium as a complete
IgG. Lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies) was used to
transiently transfect 50 μg of pFUSE-H6VH and 50 μg
of pFUSE-H6VL into 4 x 107 CHO cells re-suspended
in 30 mL of CD-CHO serum-free medium in a 125 mL
spinner flask. Cells were cultured at 37°C on an orbital
shaker with humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
The medium was collected the third day after cell
centrifugation, replaced by fresh medium and collected
again after further 4 days of culture.

ELISA binding assay
The 31 amino acid peptide corresponds to the
second extracellular loop of claudin3 (2CL3) according to
the predictive model of claudin3 [33] and was previously
used for the scFvH6 isolation from a pre-immune library
[20]. The same peptide was used in combination with the
two peptides 2CL4 and 2CL7 corresponding to the second
extracellular domain of claudin4 and claudin7 (Table 1)
to test the IgGH6binding specificity by ELISA. In vitro
peptide synthesis and N-biotinylation was performed at
Alpha Diagnostics International. The peptides (100 ng/
well) were absorbed on a streptavidin-coated 96 well plate
overnight at 4°C. After blocking (5% milk), 100 μL of
IgGH6-containing supernatant or 400 ng/well of ScFvH6
were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. Bound IgGH6
was detected with goat anti-human Fc HRP-conjugated
antibody (1:10.000; Sigma Chemical Company). Bound
ScFvH6 was detected with an anti-myc tag antibody (9E10
clone,1:1500; Roche Diagnostics), followed by anti-mouse
HRP-conjugated antibody (Sigma Chemical Company)
as previously described [20]. The immunoreactions was
developed with soluble BM blue POD substrate (Roche
Diagnostics), stopped by the addition of 1 M sulfuric acid
before plate reading at 450nm.

Production of human IgGH6
ELISA was used to verify the presence of IgGH6
in CHO supernatant. Streptavidin-coated plates were
incubated o/n at 4°C with biotin conjugate-goat-antihuman IgG γ chain specific (1:10000 in PBS, Sigma
Chemical Company). After blocking, 100μL of IgGcontaining supernatant were added to each well and
incubated for 1.5 h at RT. Bound IgGs were coupled to
mouse-anti-human IgG κ chain specific (Santa Cruz,
1:500 in 1% milk/PBS) and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated

Surface plasmon resonance assay
SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore
X instrument (GE-Healthcare Life Science). Biotinylated
2CL3 peptide (2 μg/mL in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20)
was coated onto the SA streptavidin sensor chip at an
immobilization density of 1,612 resonance units (RU)
equal to 0.35 pmol/mm2 of the peptide. Increasing

concentrations of IgGH6 in the same buffer buffer were
injected 4 min before dissociation measurement (10 min).
After every run, the sensor chip was regenerated by the
injection of 10 mM glycine, pH 2.0.

5–7 weeks old were purchased from Harlan SpragueDawley (Indianapolis, IN) and housed in a pathogen-free
environment at Yale University. They were given basal
diet and water ad libitum. All experimental procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC). C.B-17/SCID mice were injected
subcutaneously with 5 × 106 cells derived from OSPCARK-1. Four weeks later, 20 μg of IgGH6–790-I were
injected IV and 6 hours later animals were sacrificed
and tumors were excised and visualized using an In-Vivo
FX PRO system (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA;
excitation/emission 760/830nm; exposure time 60 seconds).
As controls, tumors excised from mice injected with the
vehicle solution were visualized using the same protocol.

Flow cytometry
Total claudin3 expression was evaluated on
permeabilized cells with rabbit anti-claudin3 polyclonal
antibody (Life Technologies), followed by incubation with
anti-rabbit-FITC secondary antibody. The ability of IgGH6
to recognize cell surface claudin3 was tested on unfixed
OSPC-2, USPC-4, UCI-107, and HEK293 cells. After
detachment with 0.5 mM EDTA, cells were incubated for
1 h with 2.5 μg/mL of purified IgGH6 followed by a 30 min
incubation with mouse anti-human IgG-FITC secondary
antibody (Southern Biotech). Cells were acquired on a
FACS-Calibur flow cytometer and samples were analyzed
by Cell quest Pro Software (Becton Dickinson) gating on
Annexin V (BD Pharmingen) negative cells. Percentages
and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of positive cells
were determined considering the position of hystograms of
unstained cells and subtracting MFI values of their natural
fluorescence, respectively.

This work was supported by a grant from Regione
Lombardia (Network-Enabled Drug Design), by R01
CA154460–01 and U01 CA176067–01A1 grants from
NIH, the Deborah Bunn Alley Foundation, the Tina
Brozman Foundation, the Discovery to Cure Foundation,
Ministero della Salute grant RF-2010–2313497, and the
Guido Berlucchi Foundation to ADS.

OSPC-2, USPC-4 and UCI-107 cells were seeded
on cell culture slide (SPL Life Science Co), grown to 50
to 70% confluency and treated with 2.5 μg/mL of IgGH6
for 1 hour at 4°C or at 37°C in the absence or in the
presence of FITC-conjugated Clostridium perfringens
carboxy-terminal fragment CPE290–319 peptide (10 μg/mL).
After washing, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for
15 min at RT and incubated with 0.5 μg/mL of anti-human
IgG-Alexa647-conjugated antibody. Membrane and nuclei
were stained with WGA-Alexa488 (Life Technologies)
and DAPI respectively. Finally, cells were washed with
PBS and mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent
(Life Technologies). Samples were analyzed using an
epifluorescence microscope Axiovert 200 equipped with a
63x/1.4 NA Oil Objective and APOTOME.2 system. Serie
of Z stack fluorescent images were analyzed by INSIDE
4D and Extended focus modules of Axiovision software
(CarlZeiss).
