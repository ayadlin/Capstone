ABSTRACT
The risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) increases dramatically with age. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of
brain aging is crucial for developing preventative and/or therapeutic approaches for
age-associated neurological diseases. Recently, it has been suggested that epigenetic
factors, such as histone modifications, maybe be involved in brain aging and agerelated neurodegenerations. In this study, we investigated 14 histone modifications
in brains of a cohort of young (3 months), old (22 months), and old age-matched
dietary restricted (DR) and rapamycin treated BALB/c mice. Results showed that 7
out of all measured histone markers were changed drastically with age. Intriguingly,
histone methylations in brain tissues, including H3K27me3, H3R2me2, H3K79me3
and H4K20me2 tend to disappear with age but can be partially restored by both DR
and rapamycin treatment. However, both DR and rapamycin treatment also have a
significant impact on several other histone modifications such as H3K27ac, H4K16ac,
H4R3me2, and H3K56ac, which do not change as animal ages. This study provides
the first evidence that a broad spectrum of histone modifications may be involved in
brain aging. Besides, this study suggests that both DR and rapamycin may slow aging
process in mouse brain via these underlying epigenetic mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

deeper understanding of the processes underlying normal
brain aging [1-2]. Brain aging is marked by a gradual
decline in cognitive function, which is often correlated
with age-dependent deterioration of synaptic function
in brain regions crucial for memory formation and
consolidation, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex [3-4]. The neurobiological processes underlying
these age-related learning and memory deficits include
aberrant changes in gene transcription that eventually
affects the plasticity of the aged brain. Changes in gene
expression in neurons were thought to take place during

In industrialized countries, life expectancy is rapidly
rising, and this has led to an increasing incidence of agerelated neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) and Huntington
Disease (HD). The lack of effective therapies that can
halt and/or reverse the progression of these disorders
creates an enormous burden on both affected individuals
and society as a whole. Developing preventative or
therapeutic interventions for such conditions demands

brain aging, and analysis of regions of the hippocampus
and front cortex by microarray has confirmed this [5-7].
The molecular mechanisms underlying these changes in
gene expression and the regulation are largely unknown,
but recent studies point to a novel possibility that the
dysregulation of epigenetic control of gene expression
may be involved [8-10].
The term “epigenetics” was first coined by Conrad
Waddington in the 1940s to describe interactions of genes
with their environment during development stages [11].
The first suggestion that DNA methylation might play
an important biological role was made by Griffith and
Mahler in 1969 indicating that it could provide a basis
for long term memory in the brain [12]. The two most
widely studied epigenetic codes are DNA methylation
and histone modifications. Epigenetic regulation is a key
transcriptional mechanism that alters gene expression by
altering the structure and/or conformation of chromatin but
does not change the basic genetic code. Many fundamental
cellular processes are affected by epigenetic modulation,
and it has become evident that chromatin-based
epigenetic mechanisms underlie important aspects of
the aging process. Recent reports indicate that chromatin
remodeling via histone acetylation plays a crucial role in
regulating synaptic and cognitive function in aging and
neurodegenerative brains [13-16]. Increasing histone
acetylation by inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC)
enhances gene transcription and improves hippocampal
long-term potentiation (LTP) or memory functions in
several experimental models of neurological diseases [1719], indicating that dysregulation of chromatin acetylation
may be involved in certain forms of cognitive impairment
[20-21]. Histone methylation can occur on either lysine
(K) or arginine (R) residues, and can be mono-, di- or
trimethylated, and either activation or repression is
dependent upon the particular histone residue, that is
modified [22-23]. Therefore, identifying new histone
modifications that may be involved in brain aging has a
potential to provide critical insights into the neurobiology
of aging and possibly the etiology of neurodegenerative
disorders.
Dietary restriction (DR) delays aging and improves
resistance to disease in a fashion that is evolutionarily
conserved from yeast to primates and humans [24-25],
though controversy was stirred lately on an NIH-initiated
primate cohort study [26]. These beneficial effects
include, in mammals, the attenuation of age-associated
cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration [27-28].
More specifically, synaptic plasticity was shown to be
enhanced by DR, as evidenced by increased LTP [29].
rapamycin, an antibiotic, is already in use for suppressing
the immune system in transplant patients and has been
used in the treatment of certain cancers for decades.
Lately rapamycin treatment produced remarkable effect
of extending lifespan even though it was not started until
the mice had lived 600 days - equivalent to human being
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

aged 60 years [30]. A similar benefit on lifespan has also
been observed when started on the drug at a younger age
(9 months old) [31]. Blagosklonny discussed the link
between aging and diseases by rapamycin treatment [32].
Moreover, Rapamycin has been found to have the potential
for reversing some of the effects of premature aging [33].
Interestingly, rapamycin treatment suppresses brain aging
in senescence-accelerated OXYS rats [34] and results
in an improvement in cognitive functions that normally
decline with age in mice [35-36]. Furthermore, inhibition
of mTOR by rapamycin can slow or block AD progression
in a transgenic mouse model of the disease [37].
Finally, epigenetic factors are not only inheritable
but also reversible. Thus, these factors, such as histone
acetylation and methylation, may participate in the
modulation of cell plasticity in responses to environmental
cues in the brain. It is of great interest to hypothesize
that intervention approaches such as DR and rapamycin
administration, which not only extending the lifespan
of animals under certain conditions but also promote
certain brain functions in mice, may impact some ageinduced post-translational modifications of histones. In the
present study, we aim to test this hypothesis by examining
expression of a panel of 14 histone modifications in brains
of a mouse cohort in which the mice were maintained for
over 2 years either eating ad libitum, or with either DR or
rapamycin treatment.

RESULTS
To identify the histone modifications which either
change with age and/or respond to age-interventions
including DR and rapamycin treatment in mouse brain, a
cohort of BALB/c mice with groups of young (3 months),
old (22 months), old age-matched DR, and old agematched rapamycin treatment and a panel of 14 histone
antibodies against specific methylations or acetylations
in residues of both lysine (K) and arginine (R) were
applied in this study (Table 1). Surprisingly, over 50% of
detected histone modifications in brains from these mice
were altered as a result of the age of animals or the ageinterventions. Interestingly, those modifications have not
been reported to be associated with brain aging or ageinterventions until now.
Among the measured histone modifications, the
levels of H3K27me3, H3R2me2 and H3K79me3 in brains
of old (22 months) mice were reduced to 68% (p < 0.01),
83% (p < 0.05) and 67% (p < 0.05) respectively when
compared to 3-month old animals. However, both DR and
rapamycin treatment prevented the age-induced losses of
H3K27me3, H3R2me2 and H3K79me3. Specifically, DR
restored the levels of these histones of old age group to
92.5%, 132% and 104% of young age group, respectively,
and likewise, rapamycin exhibited an even stronger impact
by increasing the levels of these histone methylations
to 133%, 132% and 120% of those seen in the young

(76%, p < 0.05 and 44%, p < 0.01, respectively) and
rapamycin (77%, p < 0.01 and 16%, p < 0.05, respectively)
when compared to the old group. Furthermore, the level of
H3K4me declined with age and was further diminished
by both DR and rapamycin (51% and 70%, p < 0.01,
respectively), when compared with the old group.
Both DR and rapamycin also demonstrated
unique functions in modulating the expression of
histone modifications that do not respond to age. Four
transcriptional activation histone modifications, H3K27ac,
H4K16ac, H4R3me2 and H3K56ac, do not shown
detectable differences between young and old brains, but

age group (Figure 1A-1C). Interestingly, the level of
H4K20me2 is increased with age (159%, p < 0.05) when
in mice on DR, this was reduced to 108%. Rapamycin
treatment, contrary to DR, was unable to suppress the ageinduced H4K20me2 expression (Figure 1D).
In addition, levels of H3K18ac, H3K4me2 and
H3K4me were also changed with brain aging (Figure 2
A-C). The levels of H3K18ac and H3K4me2 increased
44% (p < 0.05) and 29% (p < 0.01), respectively, and the
level of H3K4me decreased 32% (p < 0.01) in old brains
when compared to that of young brains. The levels of
H3K18ac and H3K4me2 were enhanced further by DR

DISCUSSION

their expression was changed significantly by DR and/or
rapamycin treatment (Figure 2D-2G). Compared to the
age-matched controls, both DR and rapamycin treatment
increased the expression of 37% and 54%, respectively
of H3K27ac (p < 0.05); DR alone decreased expression
of H4K16ac to 69% (p < 0.05). Rapamycin increased
expression of H4R3me2 to 188% but decreased the
expression of H3K56ac over 10 times (p < 0.05).

The organization of the eukaryotic genome
into chromatin enables DNA to fit inside the nucleus.
Essentially, histone proteins form a “spool” which
allows DNA to be wound around them. Post-translational
modification of histones has an effect on the tightness of
DNA winding; it thus regulates the the accessibility of
proteins such as transcriptional activators/repressors to

the DNA to facilitate genomic functions by turning on
and off of gene expression. Tight winding keeps genes
switched off, while loosening the packaging allows gene
to be turned on. Therefore, remodeling of chromatin by
histone modifications, such as acetylation, methylation
and phosphorylation, is a key mechanism in controlling
gene transcription in a variety of important biological
processes [38].

Recent work suggests that histone acetylation has
a critical role in age-associated declines in cognitive
functions. Rodents exhibit a transient increase in histone
acetylation after exposure to different learning paradigms
[9]. Restoration of the expression of H4K12ac in mouse
brain leads to a recovery of cognitive functions [16].
More importantly, rodents, after treatment with histone
deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), have demonstrated that

targeting histone acetylation has emerged as a promising
strategy for therapeutic intervention in age-related
cognitive function decline and neurodegenerative diseases
[17, 39].
Histone methylation is another important and
widespread type of chromatin modification that is
known to influence biological processes in the context
of development and cellular responses [21]. Histone
methylation can occur on either lysine (K) or arginine (R)
residues, and these can be mono-, di- or trimethylated,
and either activation or repression is dependent upon the
particular lysine residue that is modified [21]. For instance,
H3K4me3, an active mark for transcription, is upregulated
in hippocampus one hour following contextual fear
conditioning [40]. Interestingly, a line of exciting evidence
indicates that specific histone methylations, H3K4me3
and H3K27me3, may act as a regulator of lifespan was
confirmed by studies in C. elegans [41-42]. In addition,
studies have shown that the expression of p16INK4a, a
cell-cycle regulatory protein and an aging biomarker, can
be regulated by H3K27me3 during cellular senescence
[43]. However, whether histone methylation is involved
in brain aging is still an open question. Encouragingly, we
identified alterations in the methylation level of several
hisotone residues including H3K27me3, H3R2me2,
H3K79me3 and H4K20me2 with aging of mouse
brains (Figure 1). The arginine residue methylation of
Histone 3, H3R2me2, has never been associated with
any brain function previously. More interestingly, these
age-associated alterations are prevented by DR and/or
rapamycin treatment (Figure 1). However, further work
needs to be done to (1) study the functional significance
of these histone changes in mouse brain aging, and (2)
identify the transcriptional targets of these age-associated
histone markers in neuronal cells.
Brain aging and its direct consequences, such as
degenerative diseases and even death, are inevitable;
however, scientific advances in understanding basic
aging mechanisms have made it much more feasible
to postpone aging processes and to increase the animal
lifespan using some specific regimens including DR
and rapamycin administration. DR has been studied for
decades in extending lifespans across species but the
underlying molecular mechanism is not fully clear yet
[24, 27]. Rapamycin, a bacterial product first isolated
from soil on Easter Island, is the first drug intervention
to reliably increase mammalian lifespan by 10% or more
[30-31]. More intriguingly, Kolosova et. al. first described
that rapamycin prevents brain aging in rat [34]; rapamycin
also produces an improvement in age-associated cognitive
functions in mouse[35-37]. We therefore wondered if
epigenetic modifications play a role in mediating the
beneficial effects of both DR and rapamycin in mouse
brain aging. The results from our study unexpectedly
exhibited that both DR and rapamycin can restore, at least
partially, the age-related alterations in histone methylation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels (Figure 1). This may put forward a novel epigenetic
mechanism of beneficial age-interventions. However, it is
still not known whether these epigenetic responses have
any relevance with the classic DR-driven IGF/Insulin
and rapamycin-driven mTOR pathways in the brain. In
addition, age and DR or rapamycin exhibit similar effects
on the overall level of several histone modifications,
such as H3K18ac, H3K4me2 and H3K4me (Figure 2A2C). It implies that those histone modifications may
play dual regulatory roles in mediating both age and
age-interventions. One possible favorable explanation
is that age-adaptive cellular stress responses could be
enhanced by DR and/or rapamycin to strengthen neuronal
networks and plasticity [44]. Our study also showed that
histone modifications such as H4K16ac and H3K56ac
were stable with age but regulated by DR or rapamycin
treatment (Figure 2D-2G). Interestingly, H4K16ac has
been identified as DR regulated histone marker that may
be modulated by Sirt1 regulation [45]. H3K56ac has also
been identified biochemically as a direct target of mTOR
inhibition by a chemical genomic screening recently [46].
The latter suggests a novel chromatin-regulating role for
mTOR signaling.
In summary, this study has examined a panel of
histone modifications in mouse brain, and different
patterns of histone modifications are responsive to
normal aging and age-interventions including DR and
rapamycin treatment. Based on these findings, we
propose that dysregulation of chromatin remodeling may
occur and contribute to brain aging as well as cognitive
impairments observed in age-related neurodegenerative
diseases such as AD. Promising interventions targeting
age-related conditions may prevent the associated change
of histone modifications or bypass age-induced cognitive
deficit with compensational pathways. We know that a
large amount of careful work needs to be carried out in
the future uncover the functional significance of these
promising histone modifications. We hope this study
offers enriched epigenetic information to brain aging and
neurodegeneration researchers and encourages the field to
consider and understand the role of epigenetic regulation
in neuroplasticity and cognitive function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
BALB/C female mice were produced and
maintained at the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
At weaning (3 weeks of age), they were housed 4 per box
in weaning cages. These cages were assigned to one of 3
feeding regimens using Purina LabDiet’s 5LG6 irradiated
formulation of the NIH-31 (4% fat) diet. Groups of ad
libitum (AL) fed mice, both young (3 months) and old
15887

Western blotting and quantification

(22 months), were given uninhibited access to grain. A
Group of DR mice were fed with 70% of the AL feeding
rate after weaning and continued lifelong (22 months of
age). For group of rapamycin-treated mice, the rapamycin
was encapsulated, and 2.24 mg of rapamycin per kg
body weight/day was administered (equivalent to AL
feeding) for 3 months starting when the animals were 19
months of age [30]. All procedures were carried out as
indicated in Figure 3 and approved by the animal care
and use committee of the Jackson Laboratory, and staff
veterinarians monitored mice on a regular basis, finding
no pathogens.

The proteins in sample buffer were denatured by
keeping at 100°C for 3–5 min in a dry bath. About 1~5ug
of histone proteins were separated in a 14% (w/v) SDSPAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(Bio-rad). After blocking the membrane with 5%
(W/V) BSA in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 (TBST),
the membrane was incubated overnight with primary
antibody, washed in TBST, incubated with Horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (antirabbit IgG, Sigma; anti-mouse IgG, Upstate) at 1:5,000
dilution in TBST, washed and carefully developed
with ECL (Pierce). The following primary antibodies
were used: H3(ab 1791, Abcam), H3K4me3(39159,
Active Motif), H3R2me2(04-808, UBI), H3K27me3
(39156, Active Motif), H3K79me3 (ab 2621, Abcam),
H4K20me (ab 9051, Abcam), H3K56ac(07-677, UBI),
H3K9me3(39161, Active Motif), H4K20me2(07-367,
UBI), H4K16ac(39167, Active Motif), H3K18ac (ab
1191, Abcam), H4R3me2(ab 5823, Abcam), H3K27ac
(39685, Active Motif), H3K4me(ab 8895,Abcam),
H3K4me2(07-030, UBI). The quality, especially
the specificity of all antibodies was first verified
experimentally by us (data not shown). The blot was
scanned by using Gel Doc XR system (Bio-Rad) with a
dynamic range of greater than 3 order of magnitude, and
signal intensities were quantified using Image J (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), a most popular image acquisition
tool for accurately calculating area and pixel value, and
normalized to values of total H3, which is widely used as
a loading control to quantify the amount of modifications
of histones.

Tissues preparation
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation
according to the approved protocol. Then the health status
of mice was first checked anatomically. The whole brains
including all major parts of the brain of all mice without
liver/kidney problems, severe inflammations’ or tumors
that could impact brain health (e.g., pituitary tumors) were
dissected out and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground
into powder with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and
then stored at -80°C.

Acid extraction of histones
Core histone proteins were extracted from the mouse
whole brain samples using an acid extraction method
as described by Shechter et al. with slight modifications
[47]. Briefly, all procedures were performed on ice, and all
solutions were chilled to 4°C before use unless otherwise
indicated. All centrifugation steps were performed at
4°C. Thirty to sixty microgram whole brain powder was
homogenized in ice-cold PBS containing the following:
1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1x complete protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche, cat. no. 1697498), 5mM sodium
butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, B5887). The homogenates
were centrifuged at 1000g for 10min and the supernatant
was discarded. The pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml
hypotonic lysis buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT), incubated for 30 min on
rotator at 4°C, centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min, and the
supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was aspirated. The
pellet (nuclear fraction) was then resuspended in 0.5 ml
of 0.4N H2SO4, incubated for 30 min to overnight and
centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was
transferred to a fresh tube, and proteins were precipitated
with acetone. Acid extracted histone proteins were then
collected by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min. The
supernatant was discarded, and the protein pellet was
washed with acetone. The resulting purified histone
proteins were resuspended in deionized water and stored
at -80°C until processed for Western blotting.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
statistics software. One-way ANOVA was used to evaluate
the p-value among comparisons, and then followed with
a further post-hoc multiple comparisons between groups
according to the equal variances assumed or not. Results
were presented as group means± SEM. Each group has 3-5
animals. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
