ABSTRACT
Anti-estrogen treatment, exemplified by tamoxifen, is a well-established
adjuvant therapy for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer. However,
the effectiveness of this drug is limited due to the development of resistance.
The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is critical in embryonic development, and
aberrant activation of this transduction cascade is linked to various malignancies.
However, it remains unclear whether HH signaling is activated in human breast
cancer and related to tamoxifen resistance. Deciphering how this pathway may be
involved in breast cancer is a crucial step towards the establishment of targeted
combinatorial treatments for this disease. Here, we show that the expression of
the HH signaling effector protein GLI1 is higher in tamoxifen resistant compared
to sensitive cells. Tamoxifen resistant cells have stronger ERα transcriptional
activity relative to sensitive cells, even though the ERα expression is similar in
both cell types. Knockdown of GLI1 attenuates cell proliferation and reduces
ERα transcriptional activity in both sensitive and resistant cells, irrespective of
estrogen stimulation. Combinatorial treatment of tamoxifen and the GLI antagonist
GANT61 further suppresses the growth of sensitive and resistant cells relative to
administration of only tamoxifen, and this was irrespective of estrogen stimulation.
Moreover, a positive correlation between GLI1 and ERα expression was identified in
breast cancer samples. Additionally, high GLI1 expression predicted worse distant
metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. These data suggest that the HH
pathway may be a new candidate for therapeutic targeting and prognosis in ERαpositive breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

patients who will benefit from the above therapy and to
design novel treatment strategies. Interestingly, recent
work implicates that activation of Hedgehog (HH)
signaling may have a role in the development of tamoxifen
resistance in breast cancer [4].
The HH signaling pathway has critical roles in
embryonic development and tumorigenesis [5–7]. Aberrant
activation of HH signaling is involved in several types
of malignant tumors [8], including basal cell carcinoma,
medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and cancers of the
pancreas, colon, stomach, lung and prostate. The pathway
is initiated by HH ligand [Sonic HH (SHH), Indian HH
(IHH), Desert HH (DHH)] [7, 9–11] binding to Patched
(PTCH1, PTCH2), a twelve trans-membrane domain

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women,
affecting 12% of females worldwide [1], and is the leading
cause of cancer related deaths in women [2]. Breast cancer
most frequently originates from the lobe or the milk duct,
both of which highly express estrogen receptor alpha
(ERα). Thus, the majority of breast cancers are ERαpositive, which makes them suitable for selective ERα
modulators, such as tamoxifen. Importantly, in 30% to
40% of patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy the
tumor eventually relapses, and this is a significant clinical
problem [3]. Clearly, additional and/or complementary
approaches are necessary to more accurately define

protein. In the absence of HH ligands, PTCH inhibits the
signaling of the seven trans-membrane domain protein and
proto-oncogene Smoothened (SMO). Upon HH ligand
binding, the PTCH inhibition of SMO is released and the
signal is transduced to the terminal effectors, the GLI,
Glioma associated oncogene, proteins (GLI1, GLI2, GLI3)
[11]. GLI1 is a transcription factor that acts not only as
a signaling effector but also represents a pathway target
gene [12], amplifying the HH signal. Its expression levels
thus correlate directly with pathway activity [13]. GLI1
is known to function as an oncogene [14], promoting cell
proliferation and angiogenesis [15].
Possible links between HH signaling activation
and the development of breast cancer have been widely
studied. An elevated expression of HH ligands was
associated with a basal-like breast cancer phenotype
and a poor prognosis [16]. This may be the result of
hypomethylation of the SHH promoter [17]. Genetic
alternations in components of the HH pathway, including
loss of PTCH1 or GLI1 amplification, were suggested to
result in breast cancer [18, 19]. Consistently, transgenic
mice that conditionally expressed GLI1 in the mammary
epithelium developed mammary tumors [20]. Constitutive
activation of HH signaling in MMTV-SmoM2 transgenic
mice caused alterations in mammary gland morphology,
increased proliferation, and changed stem/progenitor
cell numbers [21]. In ERα-positive breast cancer cells,
estrogen was found to act via GLI1, promoting the
development of cancer stem cells and epithelial to
mesenchymal transition [22]. Interestingly, neuropilin 2
(NRP2) signaling increased GLI1 expression in breast
tumor initiating cells, with GLI1 also inducing BMI-1, a
key stem cell factor, and NRP2 expression, establishing an
autocrine loop [23]. These studies provide insights into the
mechanisms of HH signaling activation in the mammary
gland and its possible role in breast tumorigenesis.
An additional connection between HH signaling
and ERα-positive breast cancer was suggested in 2012,
when Ramaswamy et al reported that the HH pathway can
mediate tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. In this
work evidence was provided that the PI3K/Akt pathway
activates HH signaling, bypassing the blockade of ERα
signaling that was elicited by tamoxifen treatment [4].
Our current results indicate that GLI1 is expressed
to a higher extent in tamoxifen resistant compared to
sensitive breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we also find
that depletion of GLI1 decreases ERα protein levels, with
concomitant reduction of ERα signaling activity in both
tamoxifen resistant and sensitive cells. Furthermore, GLI1
depletion enhances tamoxifen cytotoxicity in both resistant
and sensitive cells. These observations indicate that GLI1
may have a role not only for tamoxifen resistance but
can also modulate ERα signaling in both sensitive and
resistant cells.

Hedgehog signaling activity in the tamoxifen
resistant LCC2 and their parental, tamoxifen
sensitive MCF7 cells
Expression analysis of key markers of the activity of
the HH signaling pathway i.e. GLI1 and PTCH1, revealed
higher expression in the tamoxifen resistant LCC2 breast
cancer cells compared to the parental, tamoxifen sensitive
MCF7 cells (Figure1A and 1B). Notably, MCF7 and
LCC2 cells showed similar expression of the ERα mRNA
and protein [24], however the ERα target genes ADORA1
and pS2 were upregulated in the resistant cells (Figure 1A
and 1B). Cell viability assays indicated that LCC2 but not
MCF7 cells are resistant to 10 μM tamoxifen, however
20 μM tamoxifen kills both cell types (Figure 1C).
This analysis demonstrates the higher HH signaling
activity in the resistant cells and suggests that ERα
activity may also be higher, despite the comparable ERα
expression.

Depletion of ERα or GLI1 reduces cell
proliferation
To investigate the role of ERα and GLI1 in breast
cancer cell proliferation, we transfected MCF7 and
LCC2 cells with siRNAs targeting ERα or GLI1. RNA
expression analysis showed that the ERα and GLI1
siRNAs successfully knocked down the respective genes
in both cell lines (Figure 2B and 2C). Western blot analysis
also showed ERα to be dramatically decreased by ERα
siRNA treatment, and GLI1 to be downregulated by GLI1
siRNA treatment (Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure S1).
Depletion of ERα resulted in a major reduction of the cell
proliferation in both cell lines (Figure 2A), highlighting
their dependence on ERα. Depletion of GLI1 also reduced
the cell proliferation of the two cell lines, but to a lesser
extent (Figure 2A).
These observations are in-line with the significance
of ERα in breast cancer cells [3, 25, 26]. Moreover, they
indicate that GLI1 can modulate proliferation not only in
tamoxifen resistant but also in tamoxifen sensitive cells.

GLI1 depletion reduces ERα activity assayed
through an Estrogen Response Element (ERE)
reporter
To determine whether endogenous GLI1 expression
may have an impact on ERα transcriptional activity, we
used an Estrogen Response Element (ERE) luciferase
reporter. GLI1 depletion reduced ERα activity both in
MCF7 and LCC2 cells, irrespective of the presence or
absence of estrogen (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S2).

of ERα and its target genes IL20, ADORA1 and pS2 were
also reduced in the context of estrogen treatment, while
limited effects were observed without addition of estrogen
(Figure 4A). The same assay was also performed using two
additional ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines, ZR751 and
T47D, resulting in a similar downregulation of ERα, IL20
and pS2 by GLI1 knockdown (Supplementary Figure S3A).
Western blot analysis demonstrated that GLI1 depletion
downregulated ERα in both MCF7 and LCC2 cells,
irrespective of the absence or presence of estrogen for 6 or
12 hours (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure S1). As noted
before, estrogen treatment reduced ERα protein expression
[24]. Consistently, ChIP analysis revealed decreased ERα
binding at the promoter region of its target gene pS2
[27–29] following GLI1 depletion in the presence of
estrogen (Figure 4C).

Importantly, the basal level of the ERα transcriptional
activity was higher in LCC2 compared to MCF7 cells, an
observation in-line with the expression pattern of the ERα
target genes ADORA1 and pS2 (Figure 1A).
These findings suggest an interplay of GLI1 with
ERα signaling in both tamoxifen resistant and sensitive
cells.

GLI1 depletion decreases the expression of ERα
and its target genes
To address the functional consequences of the
suggested GLI1 and ERα interplay, RNA expression analysis
was used following GLI1 knockdown. GLI1 depletion was
first confirmed and also shown to decrease the expression
of the GLI1 target gene PTCH1. Moreover, the expression

The GLI inhibitor GANT61 increases the
cytotoxicity of tamoxifen on MCF7 and LCC2
cells, with or without addition of estrogen

Correlation between GLI1 and ERα/ERα target
gene expression in breast cancer - Impact of
GLI1 expression in distant metastasis-free
survival

To examine possible therapeutic applications of the
HH signaling interplay with ERα, we investigated whether
treatment of MCF7 and LCC2 cells with the GLI inhibitor
GANT61 [30] may enhance tamoxifen cytotoxicity. First,
we tested the effects of only GANT61 administration on
cell viability and cell proliferation. As expected, GANT61
treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the
viability of MCF7 and LCC2 cells (Figure 5A and 5B).
Additionally, the proliferation of both cell lines was
inhibited (Figure 5C) and the mRNA expression of ERα
and its corresponding target genes were downregulated
by 48-hour GANT61 treatment (Figure 5D and 5E).
Interestingly, a 24-hour GANT61 treatment also had
an obvious impact on cell proliferation (Supplementary
Figure S4A) and mRNA expression (Supplementary
Figure S4B).
Moreover, GANT61 co-administration with
tamoxifen further decreased the cell growth of MCF7
and LCC2 cells, and this was irrespective of the presence
or absence of estrogen (Figure 5F–5I). SiRNA depletion
of GLI1 also enhanced the impact of tamoxifen in
reducing the proliferation of the two cell lines (Figure 5J).
Similar enhancement of the tamoxifen impact by GLI1
depletion was also observed in ZR751 and T47D cells
(Supplementary Figure S3B). However, in ZR751 cells
GLI1 depletion reduced cell proliferation to a comparable
extent as tamoxifen treatment, suggesting an increased
significance of GLI1 in this cellular context.
Thus, the role of GLI1 for the proliferation of ERαpositive breast cancer cells may be exploited for therapeutic
purposes, and drug targeting of GLI1 could enhance the
tamoxifen efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer.

To explore the clinical relevance of the effect of
GLI1 on ERα signaling and breast cancer, we examined
the expression of GLI1, ESR1 (the gene encoding ERα)
and known ERα target genes in a dataset of breast cancer
samples from 286 individuals [31]. Our analysis revealed
that the expression of GLI1 positively correlates with ESR1
(Figure 6A) and the ERα targets genes pS2 (Figure 6B)
and GREB1 (Figure 6C). Then we examined the prognostic
role of GLI1 expression for breast cancer patients using the
Kaplan-Meier Plotter dataset [32]. We observed that high
GLI1 expression is associated with poor distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS) in 126 patients with Grade 1, ERαpositive breast cancer (Figure 6D).
These findings suggest that GLI1 may represent
not only a therapeutic target but could also be a valuable
prognostic marker for breast cancer patients.

DISCUSSION
Our data indicate that GLI1 depletion reduces the
proliferation of both tamoxifen resistant and sensitive
breast cancer cells (Figure 2). Moreover, the GLI inhibitor
GANT61 increases the cytotoxicity of tamoxifen on both
resistant and sensitive cells and this is irrespective of the
activation of ERα signaling by estrogen (Figure 5F–5I).
Additionally, GLI1 knockdown enhanced the effect of
tamoxifen in reducing the proliferation of four breast
cancer cell lines (Figure 5I, Supplementary Figure S3B).
These data contrast earlier observations on tamoxifen and
cyclopamine, a HH signaling inhibitor acting upstream
of the GLI factors, co-treatments, which indicated

that the two drugs counter each other’s effect [33].
Interestingly, the GLI1 depletion confers a reduction of
ERα transcriptional activity in the LCC2 and MCF7 cells,
with or without estrogen treatment (Figure 3). Note that
LCC2 cells are less sensitive than MCF7 to estrogenmediated increase in proliferation [24]. Further analysis
demonstrated that GLI1 depletion reduces ERα protein
expression (Figure 4B). Additionally, in the context of
ERα activation, GLI1 depletion elicited a consistent
reduction in the mRNA expression of ERα and the
ERα target genes analyzed (Figure 4A). These findings
may suggest that GLI1, acting as transcription factor,
regulates ERα expression when ERα signaling is on.
However, exogenous expression of GLI1 did not increase
the mRNA and protein levels of ERα (Supplementary
Figure S5A and S5B), implying that the impact of GLI1
on ERα is more complicated than a typical direct GLI1
target, e.g. PTCH1 (Supplementary Figure S5A). To
further test the hypothesis of transcriptional regulation
of ERα by GLI1 we applied ConSite [34], a web-based
tool for binding sites prediction, and took advantage of
the Position Specific Frequency Matrices (PSFM) of the
GLI1 binding sites [35]. Combined with the predicted
GLI1 binding consensus sequence [36] and following
BLAST analysis with the estrogen receptor 1 gene (ERS1),
three common hits were identified. However, we were
unable to detect convincing GLI1 binding on the ERS1
gene promoter, possibly reflecting limitations of ChIP
validated GLI1 antibodies. Unsuccessful were also our
efforts to detect possible GLI1/ERα protein interactions
using immunoprecipitations assays.
The mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance are not
entirely clear, although this phenomenon is commonly
observed. Tamoxifen resistance may be mediated by
altered ERα function/ERα signaling. Loss of ERα
function [37–39] and ERα mutations [40–42] are wellstudied mechanisms that induce resistance to tamoxifen.
Moreover, the complexity of ERα signaling is indicative
of additional pathways that may be involved in tamoxifen
resistance [43]. These include PI3K (phosphoinositide
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

3-kinase) [4], HER2 (human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2) [44], MAPK (mitogen-activated protein
kinase) [45], and NOTCH [5, 46]. We specifically
examined the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling in MCF7
and LCC2 cells. The basal level of phosphorylated Akt
(p-Akt) was found to be comparable. Moreover, PI3K/
Akt signaling in both cell lines could be activated by
insulin treatment (Supplementary Figure S6.) Although
Ramaswamy et al [4] showed that treatment with the
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 elicited a 50% decrease in GLIdependent luciferase activity in tamoxifen resistant but not
in tamoxifen sensitive MCF7 cells, they did not directly
demonstate that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is more
active in the tamoxifen resistant cells.
There is strong evidence that the ability of tamoxifen
to function as an ERα agonist or antagonist is dependent
on whether it recruits co-activators or co-repressors to
the ERα transcription complex [47–50]. This may partly
explain the observation of a tamoxifen-induced increase
in the proliferation of the ERα-positive ZR751 and BT474
breast cancer cells, which moreover, was accompanied by
a sustained upregulation of GLI1 expression [51].
Resistance to tamoxifen is a major therapeutic
concern for the treatment of breast cancer. The clinical
and experimental evidence on both intrinsic and acquired
resistance are well documented in many reviews [52–54].
Changes in the expression of ERα, ERα pathway
components or in signaling cascades interacting with
ERα are observed in experimental models of tamoxifen
resistance. Some findings are consistent with the clinical
data, while others are not. To create effective therapeutic
approaches, a further focus on the tumor itself and the
detailed classification of breast tumor subtypes, with
personalized treatment options should be considered.
Due to the complexity of tumor heterogeneity and tumor
environment, emerging high throughput technologies
will be indispensable to study and potentially overcome
tamoxifen resistance.

available dataset (Figure 6A, 6B and 6C), suggest that
GLI1 may represent a gene with implications in breast
cancer. Indeed, we observe that high GLI1 expression
predicts worse DMFS in Grade 1, ERα-positive breast
cancer patients (Figure 6D). It would be interesting but
also challenging to verify GLI1 as prognostic marker in a
larger number of patients and/or other subtypes of breast
cancer.
Taken together, in this work we have demonstrated
that tamoxifen cytotoxicity can be enhanced by blockade
of the HH pathway, reflecting a cross-talk between ERα
and GLI1 signaling, both in tamoxifen resistant and
sensitive breast cancer cells. Therefore GLI1 may be a
potential therapeutic target and moreover, could also act
as a prognostic marker in breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability

Cell culture

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates 24 hours
before starvation. GANT61 was dissolved in DMSO
(dimethyl sulfoxide), whereas E2 in ethanol. Cells were
treated with 10 nM E2 or EtOH and 10nM GANT61
or DMSO in the presence of different concentrations
of tamoxifen, and then incubated with the indicated
combination of drugs for 48 hours. Metabolic activity was
measured with the WST-1 (Water Soluble Tetrazolium
salt 1) cell proliferation reagent (Roche), and the number
of viable cells was quantified at 450 nm using a TECAN
plate spectrophotometer, with the reference wavelength
set at 690 nm. Each measurement represents the mean
of triplicates. The ordinary two-way ANOVA test was
performed using the GraphPad Prism version 6.0d.

Cell proliferation
Cell proliferation assays were performed essentially
as previously described [55]. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells per
well were seeded in 6-well plates, treated with siRNAs for
48 hours, followed by an 1 hour 10 µM EdU (5-ethynyl2′-deoxyuridine) incubation. EdU was detected by a
fluorescent-azide coupling reaction (Click-iT, Invitrogen).
For each treatment, 10 000 cells were analyzed on a FACS
calibur machine (BD Biosciences, Stockholm, Sweden).
Cell cycle distribution was calculated using the CellQuest
software (BD Bioscience).

Tamoxifen resistant cell line LCC2 and its parental,
tamoxifen sensitive cell line MCF7 were kind gifts of
Staffan Strömblad (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden). Both cell lines were cultured in DMEM
high glucose medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin and
maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. DMEM,
penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (T176-10MG) and
17β-Estradiol (E2, E2758-250MG) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. For the experiments evaluating E2 or
tamoxifen treatment, FCS with dextran-coated charcoal
and DMEM without phenol red were used. Ethanol was
the vehicle control.

PCR

SiRNA transfection

Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy mini
kit (Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA synthesis was performed
with random N6 primers (New England Biolabs) and
Superscript III (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was carried out

Cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA. GLI1

Figure 6: GLI1 expression positively correlates with the expression of ESR1 and its target genes and is a negative
prognostic marker in breast cancer. (A–C) Scatter plots showing significant correlation between GLI1 and ESR1 (A), GLI1 and pS2
(B), GLI1 and GREB1 (C) expression in a publically available breast cancer dataset, test statistics were from Pearson product-moment
correlation. (D) Kaplan-Meier plot showing that high GLI1 expression correlates with worse distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)
in patients with ERα-positive, Grade 1 breast cancer. The Kaplan-Meier plot is stratified for high (red) and low (black) GLI1 expression
(n = 126; P = 0.0081).

with the FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox)
(Roche) on a 7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems), with primers designed to detect GLI1,
PTCH1, ERα, IL20, ADORA1, pS2 and TBP (Table  1).
All amplifications were run at least in triplicate and the
fold change was normalized to the expression of TBP. The
relative expression was determined by the ∆Ct method.
All RNA expression experiments were done at least in
triplicate and representative experiments are shown.

(corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak
method) was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.0d.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Cells were seeded in 150 mm dishes and were
transfected with GLI1 siRNA or control siRNA for
48 hours. Cells were then treated with vehicle or 10
nM E2 for 30 min before harvesting and chromatin
preparation. ChIP assays were performed essentially as
described [57]. Briefly, 5 µg of ERα antibody (sc-543,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit IgG (sc2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were conjugated to
Dynabeads® Protein A beads (Life Technologies), then
antibody-bound beads were incubated with sonicated
cell lysates. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using
the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit and quantified by
PCR. Input DNA was used to produce standard curves
and the ChIP data were converted to percentages of total
input. The PCR primer sequences are given in Table 2,
with the negative control primer set (ERα ChIP NC)
originating from the ESR1 gene, 11 kb downstream of the
transcription start site.

Western blot
For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed with
RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris base pH 8.0,
1  mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF,
and 1 mM Na3VO4) supplemented with Complete Protease
Inhibitor Tablets (Roche) and Phosphatase Inhibitor
Cocktail 3 (Sigma). Proteins were separated on a 7.5%
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) followed by transfer (220 mA for 1 hour) to an
Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane
was incubated at 4°C overnight in StartingBlock™ T20
(TBS) Blocking Buffer (#37543, Thermo Scientific)
with monoclonal anti-mouse β-Actin antibody (A5441,
Sigma-Aldrich), anti-rabbit GLI1 Ab (#2553, Cell
Signaling Technology) or ERα antibody (sc-543, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with goat
anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 1 hour
in StartingBlock™ T20 (TBS) Blocking Buffer and
visualized using Pierce ECL chemiluminescent substrate
(Thermo Scientific).

Statistics
Multiple t-test and ordinary two-way ANOVA test
were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0d. P values
lower than 0.05 were considered as significant.

Luciferase reporter assay
Cells were transfected with 50 nM GLI1 siRNAs or
control siRNA. After 24 hours cells were co-transfected
with the reporter plasmid ERE-TK-Luc and the pRL-TK
control plasmid, which contains the Renilla luciferase
gene, for normalizing transfection efficiency. Plasmid
transfection was done using Lipofectamine 3000
(Invitrogen). After 24-hour plasmid transfection, the cells
were changed to serum-deprived medium, incubated
overnight, and then treated with 10 nM E2 or vehicle
for 24 hours prior to harvesting. Luciferase activity was
measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega). The reporter plasmid ERE-TK-Luc has
been described previously [56]. Multiple t-test analysis
