Abstract
Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which is highly expressed in
human lung and breast cancer tissues, induced resistance to
cell death against various stimuli. Treatment of NCI-H1299
cells, which express a high level of HSP27, with small interference RNA specifically targeting HSP27 resulted in inhibition of their resistance to radiation or cisplatin, suggesting that
HSP27 contributed to cellular resistance in these lung cancer
cells. Furthermore, because HSP27 interacts directly with the
COOH terminus of the protein kinase CD (PKCD)-V5 region with
ensuing inhibition of PKCD activity and PKCD-mediated cell
death, we wished to determine amino acid residues in the V5
region that mediate its interaction with HSP27. Investigation
with various deletion mutants of the region revealed that amino
acid residues 668 to 674 of the V5 region mediate its interaction
with HSP27. When NCI-H1299 cells were treated with biotin
or with FITC-tagged heptapeptide of the residues 668 to 674
(E-F-Q-F-L-D-I), the cells exhibited dramatically increased
cisplatin or radiation-induced cell death with the heptapeptide
having efficient interaction with HSP27, which in turn restored
the PKCD activity that had been inhibited by HSP27. In vivo
nude mice grafting data also suggested that NCI-H1299 cells
were sensitized by this heptapeptide. The above data strongly
show that the heptapeptide of the PKCD-V5 region sensitized
human cancer cells through its interaction with HSP27, thereby
sequestering HSP27. The heptapeptide may provide a novel
strategy for selective neutralization of HSP27. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Apoptosis is responsible for the removal of unwanted or
supernumerary cells during development as well as in adult
homeostasis (1), and it is the predominant form of cell death
triggered by cytotoxic drugs in tumor cells (2). Several members of
the protein kinase C (PKC) family serve as substrates for caspases,
and the PKCy isozyme is associated with apoptosis. The activation
and down-regulation of PKCy have been found to be associated
with inhibition of cell cycle progression (3) and tumor promotion
(4), respectively, suggesting that PKCy may have a negative effect

on cell survival. In addition, the proteolytic activation of PKCy is
associated with apoptosis due to DNA damage induced by UV,
ionizing radiation, cisplatin, etoposide, arabinoside, and doxorubicin (5–7). Moreover, several studies confirmed that the ectopic
expression of a PKCy catalytic fragment results in cell death (8, 9),
and Mizuno et al. (8) showed that the kinase activity associated
with the PKCy catalytic fragment may be a key participant in the
late stage of apoptosis.
Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), a human form of small heat shock
protein (in murine system, HSP25 is present and these two forms
have homology of more than 90%), has been suggested to protect
cells from apoptotic cell death triggered by hyperthermia, ionizing
radiation, oxidative stress, Fas ligand, and cytotoxic drugs (10–12).
Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the HSP27mediated apoptotic protection. For example, its specific interaction
with cytochrome c in cytosol released from mitochondria prevents
apoptosome formation (13, 14). The elimination of unfolded protein
via the extra lysosomal, energy-dependent, ubiquitin-proteasome
degradation pathway is another mechanism that contributes to
protection of cells from stress stimuli. HSP27 binds to polyubiquitin
chains as well as 26S proteasomes, and the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway is involved in the activation of transcription factor nuclear
factor nB through the degradation of its main inhibitor InBa (15).
Moreover, phosphorylated HSP27 has been shown to bind an
adaptor protein, Daxx, and then to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis
(16). Interaction between HSP27 and Akt is also necessary for
Akt activation, and this is followed by dissociation of phosphorylated HSP27 from Akt (17). We recently reported that the
radioprotective effect of the related HSP25 involves delayed cell
growth (18, 19) and HSP25-mediated MnSOD gene expression
(20, 21). In addition, attenuation of oxidative stress–induced
apoptosis by HSP25 was found to be due to inhibition of the
PKCy-mediated extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 pathway
and of PKCy-mediated reactive oxygen species production (22).
Furthermore, HSP25 was found to bind directly to the V5 region of
PKCy and inhibit the PKCy activity, resulting in HSP25-mediated
cytoprotection and apoptosis blockade (23).
Overexpression of HSP27 may predict poor response to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy and, hence, poor prognosis in
general. In addition to its putative involvement in drug resistance
and radioresistance, HSP27 has also been shown to be related to
cell growth and motility (24, 25). High HSP27 levels may be
associated with aggressive growth and infiltration and with poor
prognosis (26–28).
In the present study, we showed that amino acid residues 668 to
674 of the V5 region of PKCy was necessary for HSP27 binding.
Based on this information, we prepared a novel heptapeptide
containing the region required for HSP27 binding and showed that

the heptapeptide attenuated HSP27-mediated resistance and
neutralized endogenous HSP27 in human lung cancer cells, which
frequently express high level of HSP27.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human non–small cell lung cancer cell lines, NCI-H23, NCIH358, NCI-H460, NCI-H596, and NCI-H1299, were grown in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, HEPES, and antibiotics at 37jC
in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Murine fibroblast L929 cells were
cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS,
glutamine, HEPES, and antibiotics at 37jC in a 5% CO2 humidified
incubator.
Chemicals and reagents. Anti-HSP27, anti–h-actin, anti-PKCy, and
anti–glutathione S-transferase (GST) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti–cytochrome c (PharMingen) was also used. Cisplatin
was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-biotin, streptavidin-linked agarose
beads, cisplatin, and Taxol were from Sigma Chemical Co.
Plasmids. Wild-type PKCy (GenBank accession no. AY545076), the
catalytic domain (amino acids 334–674, CAT), and the dominant-negative
catalytic domain (amino acids 334–674, CAT-KR) were cloned into pcDNA3
that contains a COOH-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag (23). To construct
the PKCy-deletion mutants, each DNA fragment was amplified using
mutagenic primers containing an EcoRI site by PCR. The amplified PKCy
mutants were also cloned into pcDNA3 that contains a GST tag. Wild-type
mouse HSP25 (GenBank accession no. XM124655) was cloned into
pcDNA4HisMaxC (Invitrogen), which contains an NH2-terminal His tag (23).
Irradiation. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and incubated at 37jC
under humidified 5% CO2 in culture medium until 70% to 80% confluent.
Cells were then exposed to g-rays with 137Cs g-ray source (Atomic Energy of
Canada, Ltd.) with a dose rate of 3.81 Gy/min.
Cell transfection. Predesigned small interference RNA (siRNA) for
human HSP27 (5¶-GUUCAAAGCAACCACCUGUtt-3¶) was purchased from
Ambion, Inc., and negative control siRNA (5¶-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA3¶) was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. Cells were transfected with
peptides (Peptron) or siRNAs by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and
with plasmids by Lipofectamine Plus reagent and Lipofectamine reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
Colony-forming assay. Clonogenicity was examined by the colonyforming assay as previously described (29). Cells were seeded into 60-mm
dishes at a density to produce f500 colonies per dish in the control and
were incubated for 7 to 14 days. Colonies were fixed with a mixture of 75%
methanol and 25% acetic acid and stained with 0.4% trypan blue. The
number of colonies consisting of 50 or more cells was scored.
MTT assay. After cisplatin treatment, the cells were assayed for their
growth activity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) test. The MTT test was done as previously
described (29).
Flow cytometry. Cells were cultured, harvested at the indicated times,
stained with propidium iodide (1 Ag/mL) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol, and then analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson).
Immunoblotting. For PAGE and Western blotting, cells were solubilized
with lysis buffer [120 mmol/L NaCl, 40 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% NP40].
Immunoblotting was done as previously described (29).
Immunoprecipitation. Cells (1  107) were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
0.1% NP40]. After centrifugation (10 min at 15,000  g ) to remove
particulate material, the supernatant was incubated with antibodies (1:100)
with constant agitation at 4jC. The immunocomplexes were precipitated
with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and analyzed by immunoblotting.
PKC assay. Cellular proteins were extracted with PKC extraction buffer
[50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 2.5 mmol/L EGTA and 10% glycerol], containing protease inhibitors
(10 Ag/mL each of aprotinin and leupeptin and 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmol/L NaF,
0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 10 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate). One hundred

micrograms of protein of cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with
3 Ag of anti-PKCy antibody and 30 AL of protein G-Sepharose by incubation
for 3 h at 4jC. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice each with PKC
extraction buffer and PKC reaction buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 2.5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L NaF,
0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4 and 10 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate] and then
resuspended in 20 AL of PKC reaction buffer. The kinase assay was initiated
by adding 40 AL of PKC reaction buffer, containing 10 Ag of myelin basic
protein as a substrate (Upstate) and 5 ACi of [g-32P]ATP. The reactions were
carried out at 30jC for 30 min and terminated by adding SDS sample
buffer; the mixtures were then boiled for 5 min. The reaction products
were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.
Immunofluorescence analysis. Cells transfected with FITC-peptides
were analyzed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems).
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue microarray of lung tissues was used for
the immunostaining of HSP27. Tissue microarray of human lung cancers
was purchased from US Biomax, Inc. Tumor slides were deparaffinized and
rehydrated using xylene and alcohol; for immunoperoxidase labeling,
endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in absolute methanol
for 15 min at room temperature. Primary anti-HSP27 antibody was reacted
with the tissue for 2 h in a humid chamber at room temperature and
washed with PBS for 10 min, and the sections were incubated for 20 min at
room temperature with secondary antibody. After additional incubation
with streptavidin-HRP for 10 min, immunoreactive sites were visualized
using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine for 5 min. The sections were counterstained
with Harris’ hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted with coverslips.
Histidine pull-down assay. After transfection with histidine-tagged
DNA for 48 h, cells were harvested and whole-cell extracts were prepared as
described above. Cell extracts were mixed and incubated with nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for 30 min at 4jC in the presence of
10 mmol/L imidazole. After washing the resin with buffer containing
10 mmol/L imidazole, proteins were recovered by suspending in Laemmli
sample buffer and were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis with anti-GST antibodies.
Biotinylated peptide binding assay. Biotin-labeled peptides (Peptron)
were transfected into cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After
incubation for 24 h, cells were harvested and whole-cell extracts were
prepared as described above. Cell extracts were mixed with 5 AL of
streptavidin-linked agarose beads (1:1 suspension) and incubated for 30 min
at 4jC. After washing the resin with lysis buffer, proteins were recovered by
suspending in Laemmli sample buffer and were then subjected to SDSPAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-HSP27 antibodies.
Tumor xenografts in nude mice. A single cell suspension (3  106 cells)
with a viability of 95% was s.c. injected into the hind legs of 5-week-old
BALB/c athymic nude mice (Charles River Japan). The volume injected was
50 AL per mouse to avoid leakage, and a different site was used for each
injection. When the tumor reached a minimal volume of 150 to 250 mm3,
radiation (12 Gy) with local regional application was started. Each group
consisted of three mice, and tumor volumes were determined according to
the formula (L  l 2) / 2 by measuring tumor length (L) and width (l) with a
caliper. All animal work was carried out in accordance with our institute
policies.

Results
HSP27 is highly expressed in human lung and breast cancer
tissues. To examine the HSP27 expression in normal and cancerous
tissues, especially in lung cancer, and whether HSP27 can be used as
a cancer marker, immunocytochemical analysis was done using a
tissue array that consisted of 45 lung tissues including squamous
cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. As seen
in Fig. 1, HSP27 was found to be overexpressed in cancer tissues
when compared with that of corresponding normal tissues,
suggesting that HSP27 may be used as a cancer predictor in lung
cancer tissues. When we examined HSP27 expression in human

breast tissues using tissue array embedded 25 cases of malignant
cancer, similar effects were observed (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Moreover, HSP25 expression in rat mammary tumors was greater in
more advanced malignant tumors (grade 2), which was induced by
dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, than in normal mammary gland
tissues or less advanced malignant tumors (grade 1; Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
Expression levels of HSP27 correlate with resistance and
with interaction with PKCD in lung carcinoma cell lines. There
have been several reports showing that high expression of HSP27
correlates with resistance to DNA-damaging agents such as
radiation or chemotherapeutic agents (24, 29, 30). Therefore, lung
cancer cells with different levels of HSP27 expression were
examined. Expression levels of other heat shock proteins such as
HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110 were not largely different. Indeed,
expression levels of HSP27 were found to correlate with survival
after radiation damage (Fig. 2A); NCI-H358 and NCI-H1299 cells
with higher HSP27 expression had less cell death, whereas NCI-H23
and NCI-H460 cells with lower HSP27 expression experienced more
cell death. When NCI-H1299 cells with higher HSP27 expression
were treated with siRNA targeting HSP27, radiation-induced
clonogenic survival by HSP27 was significantly reduced to the
similar level of NCI-H460 cells, which have lower HSP27 expression.
In addition, the MTT assay also revealed that, after cisplatin

treatment, significantly increased survival corresponding to high
levels of HSP27 was inhibited by siRNA of HSP27 (Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, data on cell death indicated that HSP27 was involved
in resistance to radiation or chemotherapeutic drug treatment
(Fig. 2C). HSP27 inhibited radiation- or cisplatin-mediated cleavage
of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP;
caspase-dependent apoptosis markers), whereas siRNA of HSP27
restored these phenomena (Supplementary Fig. S2A). On the other
hand, when we overexpressed HSP27 to NCI-H460 cells which
showed lower HSP27 expression, clonogenic assay upon irradiation
or MTT assay by cisplatin treatment indicated increased survival
than in control NCI-H460 cells. The increase was equivalent to that
of NCI-H1299 cells with higher endogenous HSP27 expression
(Supplementary Fig. S3). These data suggest that HSP27 is involved
in cellular resistance in lung cancer cells. When we examined these
phenomena using breast cancer cells lines such as MCF-7 or MDAMD231 cells, higher expression of HSP27 and increased radioresistance or chemoresistance were shown in MCF-7 cells when
compared with those of MDA-MD231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
In our previous studies, interaction between HSP27 and PKCy
was found to be involved in HSP27-mediated radioresistance
(23, 30). Therefore, using NCI-H1299 and NCI-H460 cells, the
interaction between these two proteins was examined by
coimmunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 2D, greater interaction

the diaminobenzidine method that produces a brown color. All lung cancers in this array were shown to be strongly HSP27 positive when compared with
nonneoplastic tissue.

Figure 2. Correlation between expression levels of HSP27 and radioresistance or chemoresistance. A, cell death of the human lung carcinoma cell lines NCI-H23,
NCI-H358, NCI-H460, NCI-H596, and NCI-H1299 after exposure to 10 Gy of g-radiation for 72 h was measured by flow cytometric analysis after propidium iodide
staining. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. Cell lysates were immunoblotted (IB ) with the indicated antibodies and immunoprecipitated

transfection with control siRNA (siControl ) or HSP27 siRNA (siHSP27 ), with or without exposure to g-radiation or cisplatin, was measured by clonogenic survival
(15 d after radiation treatment) and MTT assay (48 h after cisplatin treatment). Western blotting was done with anti-HSP27 antibody. Points, mean of three independent
experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, versus siControl-transfected NCI-H1299 cells. C, cell death with or without exposure to 10-Gy g-radiation for 72 h or 50 Amol/L

D, cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies and immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCy. The resulting precipitates were analyzed by anti-HSP27
and PKCy kinase assay. Representative results of three independent experiments.

between PKCy and HSP27 and lower PKCy kinase activity were
found in NCI-H1299 than in NCI-H460. When NCI-H1299 cells were
treated with siRNA of HSP27, the HSP27-PKCy interaction
disappeared and PKCy kinase activity was restored. When we
overexpressed HSP27 to NCI-H460 cells which normally exhibit
lower expression of HSP27, radiosensitivity or chemosensitivity was
inhibited and greater interaction between HSP27 and PKCy was
observed when compared with those of control NCI-H460 cells.
Moreover, higher PKCy kinase activity in NCI-H460 cells was also
suppressed, which was similar to the level of NCI-H1299 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3), further suggesting that the interaction
between HSP27 and PKCy was involved in HSP27-mediated
radioresistance or chemoresistance.
Overexpression of the catalytic domain of PKCD overcomes
HSP27-mediated chemoresistance or radioresistance. Our
earlier studies together with the above result indicate that
interaction of HSP27 with PKCy inhibits PKCy kinase activity.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

Indeed, it was shown that the PKCy-CAT domain is the binding site
for HSP27, and kinase activity is important for this interaction
(23, 30). Therefore, to confirm the involvement of PKCy in
radiation- or cisplatin-mediated cell death, several constructs of
PKCy were generated, including a wild-type (PKCy-WT) construct
and deletion constructs of the catalytic domain of PKCy (PKCyCAT) and a kinase-defective dominant negative mutant of the
catalytic domain of PKCy (PKCy-CAT-KR). As seen in Fig. 3A, the
interaction of HSP27 and PKCy was evident in PKCy-WT– and
PKCy-CAT–transfected NCI-H1299, whereas no interaction was
observed in CAT-KR–transfected cells. In addition, interaction of
HSP27 with PKCy-WT or PKCy-CAT was not observed when NCIH1299 cells were cotransfected with HSP27 siRNA, suggesting
specific binding between HSP27 and PKCy. In addition, PKCy
kinase activity was increased by transfection of PKCy-WT when
compared with the control pcDNA–transfected NCI-H1299 cells,
and transfection of PKCy-CAT augmented PKCy kinase activation.

HSP27-Mediated Resistance and PKCd-V5

Moreover, when we cotransfected siHSP27 to PKCy-WT– or PKCyCAT–transfected cells, these phenomena were more potentiated
(Fig. 3A), suggesting that the HSP27-PKCy interaction inhibited
PKCy kinase activity. PKCy-WT and PKCy-CAT transfection
increased cell death due to DNA-damaging agents; PKCy-CAT
seemed to mediate this effect because PKCy-CAT-KR, which does
not have PKCy kinase activity, did not show increased radiation- or
cisplatin-mediated cell death (Fig. 3B). Moreover, caspase-3,
caspase-9, and PARP cleavage were increased in both PKCy-WT–
and PKCy-CAT–transfected NCI-H1299 cells, whereas PKCy-CATKR inhibited this effect (Supplementary Fig. S2B). When HSP27
siRNA was cotransfected, an increase in cell death was observed.
To elucidate whether the function of PKCy is important in HSP27mediated resistance, knockdown of PKCy using siRNA (siPKCy)
was applied, and then HSP27 was overexpressed to NCI-H460 cells.
Radiation- or cisplatin-induced cell death was significantly
inhibited by HSP27 transfection or by siPKCy, suggesting that
PKCy knockdown as well as HSP27 overexpression contributed to
resistance to cisplatin or radiation. In addition, concomitant
siPKCy and HSP27 transfection showed comparable cell death to
that of HSP27- or siPKCy alone–transfected cells, suggesting that
without PKCy, HSP27 exhibited no more increased resistance to
DNA-damaging agents (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Increased binding activity between HSP27 and PKCy and reduction of PKCy

kinase activity were also shown in HSP27-transfected NCI-H460
cells when compared with the control NCI-H460 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Therefore, these data suggest the correlation
between binding of HSP27 with PKCy and resistance to radiation
or cisplatin. Extrinsic transfection of PKCy-CAT or intervention of
binding activity between HSP27 and PKCy has the capability to
overcome HSP27-mediated resistance.
V5 region of PKCD attenuates HSP27-mediated chemoresistance or radioresistance. Because the V5 region of PKCyCAT was found to be the binding site of PKCy in interaction with
HSP27 (23), we next examined whether ectopic expression of the
V5 region of PKCy could overcome HSP27-mediated resistance to
radiation or cisplatin in NCI-H1299 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A,
transfection of the V5 region of PKCy increased PKCy activity and
interaction of the transfected V5 region with HSP27. Furthermore,
PKCy kinase activity in NCI-H1299 cells was increased by the
transfection of the V5 region of PKCy, and this activity was
sustained under various treatment conditions (Fig. 4B). Radiation
increased the PKCy kinase activity at 1 h after irradiation followed
by a decrease to the basal level (data not shown). However, when
the V5 region of PKCy was transfected into the cells, PKCy kinase
activity was higher and sustained longer than that of control
vector–transfected cells. A similar phenomenon was observed
following cisplatin treatment. Radiation or cisplatin-induced cell

Figure 4. Abolishment of HSP27-mediated resistance to DNA-damaging agents by the V5 region of PKCy. A, GST immunoprecipitates in lysates of NCI-H1299 cells
transfected with the GST-tagged V5 region of PKCy were analyzed with anti-HSP27. HSP27 or GST protein was detected with anti-HSP27 or anti-GST antibodies.
Cellular proteins were extracted after lysis with PKC extraction buffer and analyzed by PKCy kinase assay. B, at indicated time points, cellular proteins from NCI-H1299
cells, which were transfected with the GST-tagged V5 region of PKCy with or without 10-Gy radiation (1 h) or 50 Amol/L cisplatin (30 min), were analyzed by PKCy
kinase assay. HSP27 or GST protein was detected with anti-HSP27 or anti-GST antibodies. C, cells with or without 10-Gy radiation for 72 h or 50 Amol/L cisplatin
treatment for 48 h were followed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05.
D, exponentially growing NCI-H460 or NCI-H1299 cells (3  106) after stable transfection of the indicated PKCy mutants were injected into the hind legs of nude

(Supplementary Fig. S2C) were also increased by transfection of the
V5 region of PKCy. The results in nude mice grafted with NCIH1299 cells transfected with PKCy-CAT, PKCy-CAT-KR, and PKCyV5 revealed that the V5 region of PKCy significantly attenuated
HSP27-mediated resistance to radiation and that the radiation
effect was similar to that of mice grafted with NCI-H460 cells
(Fig. 4D). The doubling time of NCI-H460 cells (23 h) was similar to
that of NCI-H1299 cells (25 h), and without radiation, each mutant
transfected cell line showed similar growth pattern after xenograft
(data not shown).
Amino acid residues 668 to 674 in the V5 region of PKCD are
the binding site for HSP27. To further delineate the binding site
on PKCy for HSP27, several green fluorescent protein–labeled
deletion mutants were produced. After cotransfection of these
mutants and His-tagged HSP25 into L929 cells, the His-tag pull-

down assay was done. The COOH-terminal seven-amino-acid
sequence of the PKCy-V5 region (668–674) was the binding site
involved in the interaction with HSP27 (Supplementary Fig. S6). To
confirm this, we made a deletion mutant devoid of the COOHterminal seven amino acids (PKCyV5D668–674). Histidine pulldown assay revealed that PKCyV5D668–674 did not bind HSP27,
whereas PKCyV5 did (Fig. 5A). Next, we prepared peptides
containing the seven amino acids from residues 668 to 674 of the
V5 region (p668) and a control peptide containing residues 606 to
618 of the V5 region (p606). When FITC-conjugated peptides were
transfected to NCI-H1299 cells, increased fluorescence was
observed in both p606 and p668 peptide–transfected NCI-H1299
cells (Fig. 5B, left). Interaction of p668 with HSP27 was apparent in
NCI-H1299 cells; on the other hand, control peptide p606 did not
interact with HSP27. The binding of PKCy or cytochrome c to
HSP27 was also reduced by p668 transfection, which suggested that

p668 interacted predominantly with HSP27, thus blocking interaction of endogenous PKCy or cytochrome c with HSP27 (Fig. 5B,
right). The transfection of p668 increased PKCy kinase activity
compared with the untransfected control or p606-transfected cells.
In addition, the results of cell death experiments indicated that p668
significantly increased radiation- or cisplatin-induced cell death to a
similar or more extent as found in NCI-H460 cells; the control
peptide p606 alone did not induce any apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Mouse
xenograft data revealed that when tumor reached a minimal volume
of 250 mm3, three times treatments with FITC-conjugated p668 or
p606 to xenograft NCI-H1299 tumors showed sufficient amount of
accumulation in tumors. The treatment with FITC-conjugated p668
in NCI-H1299 tumor tissue increased PKCy kinase activity
compared with the FITC-conjugated p606-treated cells (Supple-

mentary Fig. S7). In addition, treatment with p668 in combination
with radiation dramatically inhibited the growth of NCI-H1299
tumor cells, whereas p606 did not (Fig. 5D). However, intratumor
treatment with p668 or p606 to tumor site without radiation did not
induce any tumor growth inhibition (data not shown).

Discussion
HSP27 is constitutively expressed in many cancer cells and
negatively regulates apoptotic induction. Therefore, neutralization
of HSP27 is an attractive strategy for anticancer therapy. Clinical
trials using a specific inhibitor of HSP90, 17-allylamino-17-demethyoxygeldanamycin, are in progress and seem to be providing
encouraging results (31). The fact that 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin selectively kills cancer cells has been rationalized by

Figure 5. Characterization of binding site of PKCy-V5 in interaction with HSP27. A, the indicated GST-tagged deletion mutant of the PKCy-V5 region and wild-type
PKCy-V5 region were transfected in L929 cells, and cell lysates were incubated with immobilized His-HSP25. GST proteins were detected by Western blotting with an
anti-GST antibody. His-HSP25 proteins are also shown. The transfection efficiencies of GST-tagged vectors were confirmed by Western blotting with anti-GST.
B, sequences of peptides (p668 and p606) used in this study. After transfection with FITC-conjugated p668 and p606 (10 Amol/L), the cells were incubated for 24 h
and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Control means nontransfected NCI-H1299 cells (left ). HSP27 was detected in immunoprecipitates from lysates of NCI-H1299
cells after transfection with biotin-conjugated p668 and p606 using anti-biotin, anti–cytochrome c , or anti-PKCy antibodies. Cellular proteins were extracted after
lysis with PKC extraction buffer and analyzed by PKCy kinase assay (right ). C, cell death of NCI-H460 and NCI-H1299 cells, which were transfected with
biotin-conjugated p668 or p606 with or without exposure to 10-Gy g-radiation for 72 h or 50 Amol/L cisplatin for 48 h, was measured by flow cytometry after propidium
iodide staining. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05. D, exponentially growing NCI-H460 or NCI-H1299 cells (3  106) were
injected into the hind legs of nude mice. Radiation (12 Gy) with local regional application was applied when the tumor reached a minimal volume of 250 mm3.
FITC-conjugated peptide 668 or p606 in 50-AL saline (three applications, 100 Amol/L per mouse) was injected at the tumor site from the day following irradiation.
Three mice were used in each group. Points, mean; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, versus p606-treated mice.

Figure 6. Hypothetical scheme of
sensitization to DNA-damaging agents by a
novel PKCy-V5 heptapeptide in HSP27
overexpressed cancer cells. HSP27 is
constitutively expressed in many cancer
cells to negatively regulate radiation (IR) or
cisplatin-mediated cell death through
direct interaction with PKCy. Interaction
between HSP27 and PKCy inhibited
PKCy kinase activity, which resulted in
suppression of PKCy-mediated cell death.
Treatment of cancer cells with a novel
heptapeptide that contains the binding
sequence for PKCy interaction with
HSP27 induced chemosensitization
or radiosensitization because this
heptapeptide leaves the cell endogenous
PKCy kinase activity intact.

assuming that tumor cells, when compared with their normal
counterparts, exhibit a stressed phenotype with an enhanced
dependency on the cytoprotective action of HSP90 (32). Similarly, it
has been suggested that HSP27 antisense and interference RNA
of HSP27 have chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing properties
(14, 18–21). Unlike HSP90, however, no small molecules are thus
far available that selectively inhibit HSP27.
HSP27 protein was highly expressed in various lung or breast
cancer tissues (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1A) that often show
radioresistance or chemoresistance. In rat mammary tumorigenesis models, malignant tumors showed higher expression of HSP27
than normal tissues and malignant grade was well correlated with
HSP27 expression pattern (Supplementary Fig. S1B), suggesting the
possibility of HSP27 as a cancer marker in lung and breast. To
determine the physiologic relevance of HSP27 expression and
radioresistance or chemoresistance, siRNA for HSP27 was applied
to NCI-H1299 or MCF-7 cells, which have high levels of HSP27 and
increased radioresistance or chemoresistance (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4), and the result showed highly significant
physiologic relevance of HSP27 in cancer treatment (i.e., downregulation of HSP27 resulted in sensitization to DNA-damaging
agents in a caspase-dependent manner).
PKCy activity plays an essential role in apoptosis, and the
catalytic domain of PKCy was found to be involved in this process
(Fig. 3). Therefore, with knockdown of PKCy using siRNA
technology, induction of cell death by DNA-damaging agents was
inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S5). Chemotherapeutic agents or
ionizing radiation induces translocation of PKCy to the membrane
in an open conformation, allowing its pseudosubstrate region to be
released from its substrate-binding cavity and enabling the COOH
terminus to access the substrate-binding site. Autophosphorylation
at Ser643 and Ser662 by intramolecular mechanisms then activates
downstream signaling (23). Our earlier studies indicated that
PKCy interacts with HSP25 and that phosphorylation-deficient
mutants at Ser643 and Ser662, but not phosphorylation-mimicking

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

mutants of the V5 region of PKCy, can bind to HSP25. Moreover,
HSP25 inhibits PKCy translocation to the particulate fraction,
suggesting that the primed activation of PKCy permits the V5
region to be exposed, autophosphorylated, and fully activated. As
soon as the V5 region is exposed, but before autophosphorylation
at Ser643 and Ser662, HSP25 may bind to the V5 region of PKCy, thus
stabilizing PKCy and inhibiting rephosphorylation and reactivation. Therefore, PKCy activity was inhibited by the PKCy-HSP25
interaction, and HSP27 siRNA treatment restored PKCy activity
(Fig. 2D).
As shown in the present study, rationally engineered PKCy-V5
mutant target for HSP27 could sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis
induction. Whereas PKCy-V5 has no intrinsic apoptotic stimulatory activity, PKCy-V5 exerted its radiosensitizing and chemosensitizing effect through the neutralization of HSP27 (Fig. 4).
Moreover, PKCy-V5 increased PKCy kinase activity after radiation
or cisplatin treatment. Because only seven amino acids of the V5
region constituted the binding site of PKCy, we prepared
hydrophobic, cell-permeable peptide containing these seven
amino acids (p668) and found that this heptapeptide was able
to sensitize the cancer cells to radiation or cisplatin in both
in vitro and in vivo animal models by sequestering HSP27 and
increasing PKCy activity (Fig. 5). Interestingly, HSP27 has also
been reported to interact with another apoptotic molecule, and
our present results showed that p668 transfection inhibited the
interaction of HSP27 with both PKCy and cytochrome c, thereby
neutralizing HSP27 (Fig. 5B).
Targeting protein-protein interactions that occur within the
apoptotic pathways using peptide-based cancer therapies could
provide novel, nongenotoxic alternatives or adjuvants to current
treatment protocols. Optimally, the peptide should be preferentially
toxic to cancer cells and/or work through a defined genetic
pathway that is hyperactive in malignant cells. p53-targeted
peptides, such as BH3 peptides, Smac peptides, and peptidomimetics, are good candidates for these studies (33). In this regard,

the heptapeptide of PKCy-V5 region would be beneficial for cancer
therapy in cells that show high HSP27 protein expression.
In summary, PKCy activity plays an essential role in the
apoptosis of cells because knockdown of PKCy inhibited cell death
induced by DNA-damaging agents, and HSP27 is constitutively
expressed in many cancer cells to negatively regulate apoptotic
induction. Therefore, the HSP27-PKCy interaction could indicate
the physiologic importance of this small heat shock protein.
