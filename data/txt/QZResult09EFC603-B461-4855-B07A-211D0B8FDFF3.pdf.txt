ABSTRACT
Transmembrane proteins MUC4, EGFR and HER2 are shown to be critical
in invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Besides, we and others have
demonstrated de novo expression of MUC4 in ~70-90% of pancreatic cancer patients
and its stabilizing effects on HER2 downstream signaling in pancreatic cancer.
Here, we found that use of canertinib or afatinib resulted in reduction of MUC4 and
abrogation of in vitro and in vivo oncogenic functions of MUC4 in pancreatic cancer
cells. Notably, silencing of EGFR family member in pancreatic cancer cells decreased
MUC4 expression through reduced phospho-STAT1. Furthermore, canertinib and
afatinib treatment also inhibited proliferation, migration and survival of pancreatic
cancer cells by attenuation of signaling events including pERK1/2 (T202/Y204),
cyclin D1, cyclin A, pFAK (Y925) and pAKT (Ser473). Using in vivo bioluminescent
imaging, we demonstrated that canertinib treatment significantly reduced tumor
burden (P=0.0164) and metastasis to various organs. Further, reduced expression
of MUC4 and EGFR family members were confirmed in xenografts. Our results for the
first time demonstrated the targeting of EGFR family members along with MUC4 by
using pan-EGFR inhibitors. In conclusion, our studies will enhance the translational
acquaintance of pan-EGFR inhibitors for combinational therapies to combat against
lethal pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

no evidence of improved efficacy [3]. Recently the USFDA have approved nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)paclitaxel (Abraxane, Celgene), in combination with
gemcitabine, for the first-line treatment of metastatic
pancreatic cancer [4]. On the other hand, use of single
agent that targets specific molecule in in vivo studies of
pancreatic cancer has provided modest effects in specific
genetic background. Thus combination studies providing
multiple targeting effects are warranted to improve the
pancreatic cancer patient survival.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of
cancer associated mortality in the US with a very poor
five-year survival of 6% [1]. The US FDA has approved
erlotinib for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer
in combination with gemcitabine [2]. Multiple clinical
trials have been conducted with various anti- epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies,
anti-VEGF and farnesyl transferrase inhibitors, but with

growth of lung and breast cancer, both in vitro and in vivo
[28-30].
In the present study, for the first time, we have
evaluated the role of EGFR family pan-inhibitors
canertinib and afatinib in the inhibition of MUC4-mediated
invasion, motility and metastasis of pancreatic cancer
cells. Our study provides a strong evidence of profound
effects of irreversible pan-EGFR inhibitors (TKIs) in
down regulating MUC4 mucin through its effect on the
EGFR family proteins resulting in decreased pancreatic
cancer cell proliferation, survival and migration. The in
vitro studies were further corroborated with decreased
tumorigenesis and metastasis related cell behavior in an in
vivo orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer. Additionally,
the MUC4 protein expression was not inhibited by
erlotinib, a reversible EGFR inhibitor, in pancreatic cancer
cells. Through this preclinical study, we provide evidences
for the use of irreversible TKIs as a novel approach to
reduce tumor burden as well as incidence of metastasis
by down regulating MUC4 in advanced pancreatic cancer
patients.

Aberrant expression of cell surface mucins is
a hallmark of epithelial cancers [5]. Among various
mucins, MUC4, a high molecular weight membrane
bound mucin, is one of the top most differentially
overexpressed (4th gene) in pancreatic cancer [6, 7]. Over
a period of one decade, we and others have shown that
MUC4 is undetectable in normal pancreas, while its
expression increases progressively with the advancement
of pancreatic cancer [8, 9]. We and others have also
shown the differential overexpression of MUC4 in human
primary pancreatic cancer tissues ranging from 70-90%
[9, 10]. Furthermore, earlier studies from our group have
shown that MUC4 enhances invasion and metastasis
of pancreatic cancer [11, 12]. Similarly, EGFR family
members such as HER1/EGFR (40-70%) and HER2 (22%)
are overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and are associated
with poor prognosis [13]. Our earlier studies have shown
that MUC4, a transmembrane mucin, interacts, stabilizes
and activates HER2 mediated downstream signaling in
pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells [14, 15]. It has been
proposed that MUC4 with its three EGF domain repeats
may serve as ligand for HER2 [16]. On the other hand, we
and others have also demonstrated the role of MUC4 in the
mediation of gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer
[17, 18]. Moreover, MUC4 transcriptional upregulation
was found to be activated by EGF mediated signaling
response along with activation of intracellular tyrosine
kinase in pancreatic cancer cells [19].
The concept of utilizing EGFR targeting small
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as a molecular
therapeutic agent was first proposed by Mendelsohn et
al [20]. However, several preclinical and clinical studies
evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of drugs targeting
EGFR such as erlotinib and gifatinib resulted in poor
patient outcome. Additionally, observed benefits of HER2
targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, Herceptin,
is also marginal and restricted to a subset of pancreatic
cancer patients [21]. Thus, targeting one or more EGFR
family members is an alternative approach to enhance
patient’s response to cancer therapy. There are two major
classes of TKIs, reversible TKIs that binds to the active
sites of EGFR kinase domain and irreversible TKIs that
binds to cysteine residues in the ATP binding sites of
kinase domains of all the EGFR family members (panEGFR inhibitors) [20].
Canertinib (CI 1033) is an irreversible TKI of all
the EGFR family members. It not only inhibits tyrosine
phosphorylation but also enhances ubiquitinylation and
accelerates endocytosis [22]. Canertinib induces growth
inhibition and apoptosis of melanoma, esophageal, breast
and colon cancer cells [22-26]. Preclinical data shows
that treatment of athymic nude mice bearing xenografts
of various tumors with canertinib results in a significant
suppression of tumor growth [23, 27]. Similarly, afatinib
(BIBW2992) is another irreversible pan-EGFR inhibitor
that has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the tumor

RESULTS
Canertinib and afatinib affects specifically EGFR
and HER2 activities and expression in pancreatic
cancer cells
First, we performed a MTT assay to investigate the
dose dependent inhibitory effect of canertinib, afatinib
and erlotinib TKIs on pancreatic cancer cells (CD18/
HPAF and Capan-1) for an incubation period of 24 h.
The IC50 was approximately 5 μM concentration of
canertinib in both CD18/HPAF and Capan-1 pancreatic
cancer cells, hence, these doses were utilized for
subsequent drug analysis. Similarly, afatinib and erlotinib
inhibited the growth of CD18/HPAF pancreatic cancer
cells with IC50 value of 1 μM and 20 μM concentration,
respectively. (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). We
also tested the sensitivity of human telomerase reverse
transcriptase immortalized normal human pancreatic
ductal epithelial cell line (hTERT-HPNE) to pan-EGFR
family inhibitor (Canertinib). As shown in supplementary
Figure. S1C, HPNE cells are more sensitive (IC50 of
1.5 μM) to canertinib as compared to pancreatic cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Canertinib and
afatinib treated pancreatic cancer cells showed a decrease
in phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine 1068, HER2
at tyrosine 1248 and HER3 at tyrosine 1289 residues
in pancreatic cancer cells at 5 and 1μM concentration
respectively. Interestingly, the expression level of total
EGFR and HER2 proteins also decreased with exposure
to canertinib and afatinib (Fig. 1A and B). On the other
hand, no changes in expression of HER3 and HER4 were

detected in the same panel of cell lines for both the drugs
(Fig. 1A). Additionally, the effect of canertinib could also
influence the localization pattern of EGFR in pancreatic
cancer cells. As demonstrated in supplementary Fig. S2,
we observed a decreased membranous localization of
EGFR in CD18/HPAF cells treated with canertinib as
compared to untreated control cells.

cells [33, 34]. Hence, we hypothesized that MUC4 downregulation following pan-EGFR inhibitor treatment may
be mediated through the STAT1 pathway. To determine
whether selective silencing of endogenous EGFR led to
inhibition of MUC4 mucin expression, we used an EGFR
specific siRNA approach in pancreatic cancer cells.
As expected, the EGFR siRNA treated cells resulted in
decreased phospho-STAT1 (ser727) expression, with no
change in total STAT1 expression, which consequently
correlated with decreased MUC4 expression (Fig.
2A). Further, densitometry quantification of bands also
revealed a 50% reduction in the total EGFR and phosphoSTAT1 protein level in the EGFR siRNA transfected cells
compared to scramble cells.
In addition, immunofluorescence analysis also
showed reduced expression of MUC4 in EGFR specific
siRNA transient knockdown cells as compared to
scramble siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 2B). In parallel,
western blotting was performed on cell lysates obtained
from canertinib and afatinib treatment in which STAT1
phosphorylation at serine 727 and tyrosine 701 is
significantly down regulated when compared to vehicle
control cell lysates (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig.
S3). Hence, these results imply that pan-EGFR inhibitor
inhibits phospho-STAT1 mediated response to regulate
MUC4 expression in pancreatic cancer cells, thereby
abrogating tumor advancement towards metastasis.

Pan-EGFR family inhibitors canertinib and
afatinib down regulates the expression of MUC4
in pancreatic cancer cells
Previous studies from our lab have shown that
MUC4 expression is higher in pancreatic cancer specimens
as compared to non-malignant controls [6, 14]. Also,
earlier evidence indicates that MUC4 stabilizes HER2
thereby mediating cellular signaling for proliferation
and metastasis and imparts resistance to gemcitabine in
pancreatic cancer cells [14, 17]. Hence, we next sought to
determine the influence of canertinib and afatinib on the
expression level of MUC4 along with other EGFR family
members. Intriguingly, we found that upon canertinib and
afatinib treatment there was a significant reduction in the
levels of MUC4 protein (Fig. 1A)

MUC4 and HER2 co-expression is disrupted by
canertinib

Inhibition of MUC4 mucin protein via STAT
pathway was specific to irreversible TKI but not
through reversible TKI

As our previous studies have showed MUC4
stabilization and interaction with HER2 [14, 15],
we examined whether canertinib could influence the
localization pattern of MUC4 and HER2 in pancreatic
cancer cells by immunofluorescence analysis. Our results
showed decreased membranous co-expression of MUC4
and HER2 in canertinib treated cells (CD18/HPAF and
Capan-1) as compared to control cells (Fig. 1B). This
result strongly suggests that canertinib can also target
MUC4 mucin along with EGFR family members in
pancreatic cancer cells.

Based on our observations of decreased MUC4
mucin expression upon treatment with irreversible TKIs
(canertinib and afatinib) we next sought to investigate
whether decreased MUC4 expression is specific to
irreversible TKIs or is it a common mechanism for
both classes of TKI treatment. To determine the specific
effect of small molecule irreversible and reversible
TKIs on MUC4 protein expression in pancreatic cancer
cells, erlotinib and afatinib were treated with various
concentrations-erlotinib (0, 5, 10 and 20 μM) and afatinib
(0, 500 nM, 750 nM and 1 μM) for 24 h. We did not
observe any reduction or change in the level of MUC4
protein expression in all the doses of erlotinib treatment,
as evidenced by western blot analysis. Interestingly,
MUC4 protein level markedly decreased as the afatinib
concentration increased. The most significant decline in
MUC4 protein levels were observed at 750 nM and 1
μM concentration of afatinib as compared to untreated
controls. We also assessed the effect of erlotinib on the
inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT1 at ser727. Western
blot analysis confirmed that the protein level of phospho
STAT1, total STAT1 and MUC4 protein is not altered upon
erlotinib treatment in CD18/HPAF pancreatic cancer cells

Blockade of EGFR mediated STAT signaling
inhibits MUC4 mucin protein expression
First, we aimed to identify the central mechanism
through which pan-EGFR inhibitors inhibits MUC4
protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells. It has been
previously shown that EGFR signaling can directly
activate STAT and mediate cell migration in esophageal
cancer keratinocyte cells [31]. STAT phosphorylation
at serine 727 is essential for the transcriptional activity
of different genes in cancer cells [32]. Interestingly, our
previous study has shown that the MUC4 promoter has
STAT1 binding sites and serine phosphorylation of STAT1
(ser727) regulates MUC4 expression in pancreatic cancer

and afatinib in pancreatic cancer cells. (A). CD18/HPAF and Capan-1 cells were treated with canertinib and afatinib (5 and 1 μM

concentration) for 24 hours and control cells were treated with 0.01% DMSO in complete medium. The cell lysates (40μg) were separated
by 10% SDS–PAGE and analyzed by Immunoblotting for phospho-EGFR (Y1068), phospho-HER2 (Y1248), phospho-HER3 (Y1289) and
total forms of EGFR and HER2 antibodies at indicated concentrations. In parallel, protein lysates were resolved using 2% SDS agarose gel
and MUC4 mucin protein was detected by western blot analysis employing anti-MUC4 (8G7) monoclonal antibody. Canertinib and afatinib
decreases phosphorylated and total forms of EGFR and HER2, phosphorylated form of HER3, but no change in the expression pattern of
blots probed with HER3 and HER4 specific antibodies, between the treatment and control lysates. Canertinib and afatinib significantly
decreases MUC4 expression level in both the cell lysates as observed by western blots analysis. The membranes were re-probed with
β-actin antibody for loading control. (B). Panel of immunofluorescence images of pancreatic cancer cell lines CD18/HPAF and Capan-1

with HER2, which is absent in canertinib treated cells.

cellular lysates harvested form CD18/HPAF cells transiently transfected with EGFR specific siRNA or non-targeted (scramble) control

(B). Confocal analysis of MUC4 and EGFR co-occurrence in EGFR transiently knockdown CD18/HPAF cells. After performing EGFR

Capan-1 pancreatic cells, untreated or treated with 5 μM concentration of canertinib and 1 μM concentration of afatinib, alone for 24
hour, using phospho-STAT1, total STAT1 and anti-β-actin antibodies. The mechanism by which phospho-STAT1 is inhibited under panEGFR inhibitors treatment is directly correlated with MUC4 regulation. (D). Immunoblotting analysis of MUC4 protein expression upon
increasing concentrations of erlotinib and afatinib in CD18/HPAF cells. MUC4 protein and its regulatory transcription factor phospho
STAT1 is not inhibited even at higher concentration of erlotinib. Whereas, the level of MUC4 protein expression was decreased in a
dose dependent manner, with significant inhibition starting at 750 nM and 1 μM concentration of afatinib compared to vehicle treated
controls. (E). RT-PCR was performed on pancreatic cancer cells as described in materials and methods. The representative gel images

Canertinib and afatinib inhibits migration of
pancreatic cancer cells

for 24h (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our results suggest
that MUC4 could be targeted only by irreversible TKIs
(canertinib/afatinib) but not by reversible TKI erlotinib.
This study thus provides evidence for the therapeutic
failure of erlotinib in preventing metastatic events in
advanced pancreatic cancer patients.

FAK pathway is essential for the motility or
migration of cancer cells, which was correlated with
MUC4 expression in pancreatic, ovarian and breast
cancer cells [11, 15, 35]. We have observed the decreased
level of activated FAK (Y925) in canertinib and afatinib
treated pancreatic cancer cells compared to control cells
(Fig. 4A). We also examined the sensitivity of panEGFR inhibitor on MUC4 negative background. As
shown in Supplementary Fig S4, MiaPaCa-1 cells (A
MUC4 negative pancreatic cancer cells) were treated
with indicated concentration of canertinib and analyzed
for pHER2, total HER2, MUC4 and pFAK protein
expression. Canertinib treatment resulted in marginal
decrease of pFAK in MiaPaCa-1 cells, whereas complete
inhibition of pFAK was achieved in MUC4 positive
pancreatic cancer cells (CD18/HPAF and Capan-1)
(Fig. 4A). Trans-well motility and wound healing assays
were used to measure the migration capacity of human
pancreatic cancer cells under various in vitro conditions.
Canertinib treatment resulted in a significant reduction
in the migratory potential of CD18/HPAF and Capan-1
cells, as evidenced by Trans-well migration assay (Fig.
4B). Additionally, treatment with Canertinib and afatinib
at the indicated concentration also resulted in impaired
migration of pancreatic cancer cells to migrate in to the
wounded area (Fig. 5). Previous reports have shown that
FAK and AKT are dual kinases that play a key role in
cancer cell progression specifically in metastasis. It is well
established that cancer cell adhesion is dependent on AKT
dependent activation of FAK [36]. Our results showed
that both canertinib and afatinib significantly inhibited
AKT-phosphorylation at Ser-473 in pancreatic cancer cell
lines whereas no change in the levels of total AKT was
observed (Fig. 4A). Thus, canertinib and afatinib inhibits
the migration of pancreatic cancer cells by inhibition of
AKT pathway and through a FAK dependent mechanism.

Decreased MUC4 protein is partially attributed to
decreased MUC4 gene expression by canertinib in
pancreatic cancer cells
To further confirm that MUC4 inhibition was
a gene transcriptional effect of canertinib treatment,
we adopted RT-PCR approach by isolating RNA from
pancreatic cancer cells treated with canertinib and its
corresponding vehicle control. Consistent with our
MUC4 protein expression pattern, the level of MUC4
mRNA was observed to decrease in canertinib treated
pancreatic cancer cells (CD18/HPAF and Capan-1) (Fig.
2E). This result suggests that the decreased MUC4 protein
expression following canertinib exposure is a consequence
of both the effect on MUC4 regulation and impaired
MUC4 gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells.

Inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell
cycle key regulator expression by canertinib or
afatinib decreases pancreatic cancer cell survival
To provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects
of pan-EGFR inhibitor treatment on cell survival, we
performed a Western blot analysis of control and inhibitors
treated lysates for molecules that participate in various
signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 3A decreased
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines
was observed with no change in the corresponding total
ERK1/2 level with both pan-EGFR inhibitors treatment.
Furthermore, we examined the effect of canertinib and
afatinib on cell cycle related proteins Cyclin D1 and
Cyclin A by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A,
the level of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A decreased after 24
hours of treatment with both drugs. Previous studies have
shown that altered expression of MUC4 can drive cell
cycle protein alterations [14]. We observed that canertinib
and afatinib treatment of pancreatic cancer cells resulted in
decreased cell cycle protein expression. Thus, canertinib
and afatinib could involve either independently or MUC4
dependent regulation of pancreatic cancer cell growth
and cell cycle alteration. Further, to evaluate the effect of
canertinib and afatinib on cell survival, colony formation
assay was performed in CD18/HPAF (0.1-0.3X104 cells/
well) and Capan-1 (0.1X104) pancreatic cancer cells. In
the cell lines tested, significant reduction in the number of
colonies was observed in the wells treated with canertinib
and afatinib, suggesting that these drugs might have a dual
effect on cell proliferation and cell survival (Fig. 3B).

Effective inhibition of tumor growth and
metastasis with canertinib: In vivo pancreatic
cancer orthotopic model
On the basis of our in vitro experiments we sought
to test the effects of canertinib on tumorigenicity and
metastasis using the in vivo pancreatic cancer orthotopic
model (CD18/HPAF luciferase tagged pancreatic
cancer cells). The dosage and treatment schedule for
the orthotopic mouse model system were illustrated in
supplementary Fig. S5A and we observed a significant
growth inhibitory effect (non-invasively via imaging) in
the pancreatic tumor-bearing mice treated with canertinib
compared to control mice (Fig. 6A). The images obtained
from the CD18/HPAF luciferase tagged cells were further

and Capan-1(0.1X104) pancreatic cancer cells with indicated concentrations of canertinib, afatinib and DMSO treatment. Six well plates
were seeded with above mentioned pancreatic cancer cell density in complete medium. After 48 hours of incubation, the cells were washed
with PBS and supplement with inhibitors or vehicle in complete medium (10% DMEM). After a period of 10 days of incubation the cells
were fixed with 100% ice cold methanol and stained with 0.4% crystal violet in methanol. Representative images show significant reduction
in the number of colonies in the canertinib and afatinib treated cells as compared to vehicle or untreated control cells.

normalized with in a range of 9.00e4 to 2.00 e7. The scatter
plot images revealed the maximum efficacy of canertinib
drug treatment in inhibiting cancer growth in vivo, at each
time point (Fig. 6B). An average tumor weight of 1887 ±

to 751 ± 526 mm3 in the drug treated group (P=0.0164)

As shown in Fig. 6D, canertinib oral treatment of 5 days

Further, immunohistochemical and western blot analysis
was performed on the tumor tissues isolated from the

analysis showed a reduced expression of MUC4 in
inhibitor treated orthotopic tissues as compared to control
sections. Similarly, immunoblot analysis also revealed a
reduced MUC4, pEGFR, pHER2 and phospho-STAT1
along with their respective total proteins under treatment
conditions compared to controls. These observations are
consistent with our in vitro assays as a markedly reduced

expression of EGFR, HER2 and MUC4 proteins were
observed (Fig. 6E).
Interestingly, we found a significant difference in the
incidence of metastasis between the control and canertinib
treated groups in various organs such as liver (p <0.02),
spleen (p <0.02), ovary (p <0.04), diaphragm (p=0.06)
and intestine (p<0.04) (Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig.
S5B). The histopathological changes were evaluated using
hematoxylin and eosin staining in the primary pancreatic
tumor tissues and the metastatic organ tissues isolated from
the control and inhibitor treated mice. Tumor metastasis to
distant organs such as the liver, stomach, ovary, diaphragm
and colon was clearly inhibited by canertinib treatment
(Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S5B).

treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with canertinib and
afatinib at the indicated concentrations also resulted in
significant inhibition of phospho-STAT1 and decrease
of MUC4 mucin protein expression. Down-regulation
of MUC4 expression in canertinib and afatinib treated
cells are further corroborated by down regulation of
p-STAT1 (Ser727 and Y701), a transcriptional activator
of MUC4 [45]. To further confirm the EGFR mediated
MUC4 mucin down-regulation, confocal microscopy
analysis of EGFR and MUC4 was also performed in
EGFR knockdown CD18/HPAF cells, which showed
similar observations as that of Western blot studies. Thus,
confirming that inhibiting the EGFR mediated STAT
pathway can block MUC4 mucin regulation. On the other
hand, we investigated the significance of EGFR specific
reversible inhibitor erlotinib on MUC4 downregulation.
Interestingly, erlotinib was unable to attenuate MUC4
protein level in pancreatic cancer cells which could be
possibly due to the unaltered phosphorylation status of
STAT1 (Ser 727). Thus, treatment with erlotinib appears
to be ineffective in controlling MUC4 mucin protein in
pancreatic cancer.
Indeed, in vitro addition of canertinib and afatinib
to pancreatic cancer cells also affected cell proliferation
and survival. Our results show that there is a decrease in
the number of colonies and consequently as significant
reduction of phospho-ERK1/2, CyclinD1 and CyclinA
protein levels in inhibitors treated cells. Further canertinib
and afatinib significantly contributes towards the inhibition
of migration or metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. These
were confirmed by transwell migration and wound healing
assays. The ability of these inhibitors to modulate FAK
phosphorylation adds evidence on the effect of canertinib
towards FAK mediated cell migration. Finally, the in
vivo antitumor efficacy of pan-EGFR inhibitor canertinib
was evaluated using pancreatic tumor bearing mice. Our
results show that canertinib pharmacologically reduces
tumor burden by inhibiting EGFR family members and
prevents metastatic events by down-regulating MUC4
mucin protein.
Briefly, canertinib and afatinib are irreversible
pan-EGFR TKIs that have been shown to be effective
in various cancers, but its therapeutic efficacy was not
explored in pancreatic cancer in the context of MUC4
mucin. Further, the reasoning behind our concept of
utilizing the effect of pan-EGFR inhibitor in abrogating
MUC4 mucin in pancreatic cancer are as follows: (i)
MUC4 is oncogenic and is overexpressed in pancreatic
cancer [14, 37] and (ii) MUC4 potentiates invasion,
migration and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells by
interacting with EGFR family protein HER2 [7, 12, 14,
15]. Thus, the indirect pharmacological inhibition of
MUC4 via canertinib or afatinib could result in developing
pan-EGFR inhibitors as a molecular therapeutic agent
against advanced pancreatic cancer. Notably, we were
also able to show that these changes are also associated

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal form of cancer
with a very high incidence of distant metastasis due
to aberrant expression of tumor antigens [37, 38]. We
explored for the first time the novel role of pan-EGFR
family inhibitors in reducing the metastatic potential
of pancreatic cancer, with major emphasis on MUC4
inhibition using multiple cell lines and an orthotopic
mouse model. Most pancreatic carcinomas (95%)
aberrantly express EGFR, HER2 and HER3 receptors and
their cognate ligands, promoting constitutive activation
of EGFR family members that result in pancreatic cancer
cell proliferation [39, 40]. We and others have shown
that MUC4 mucin is aberrantly overexpressed in various
cancers including pancreatic cancer [5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 41].
Furthermore, MUC4 mucin overexpression correlates with
its capacity to potentiate tumor invasion and metastasis
in pancreatic cancer [11]. We have further validated the
oncogenic role of Muc4 in the spontaneously developing
pancreatic cancer mouse progression model [42]. Thus
direct or indirect inhibition of MUC4 mucin would be an
effective strategy to suppress MUC4 mediated cancer cell
invasion and metastasis to distant organs.
It has been reported previously that EGFR is
likely to activate STAT in a manner unique from other
STAT activation mechanisms in other malignancies [43].
Further, STAT1 protein is reported to be expressed in
88% of primary pancreatic cancer patients [44], which
implies the clinical significance of STAT1 in pancreatic
cancer. Since our previous study has demonstrated
that the MUC4 promoter has STAT1 binding sites and
regulates MUC4 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
[33], we investigated whether the levels of phosphorylated
STAT1 could influence MUC4 in pancreatic cancer cells
treated with the pan-EGFR inhibitors. To prove this we
transiently inhibited endogenous EGFR using siRNA
in pancreatic cancer cells and, as expected, transient
knockdown of EGFR expression led to inhibition of
phospho-STAT1 thereby down regulating MUC4 mucin
protein expression. In addition to the transfection studies,

with a modest decrease in expression of endogenous
MUC4 total RNA, which is sufficient to impair its
downstream effectors such as FAK, AKT and ERK and
result in impaired motility, proliferation and metastasis of
pancreatic cancer cells.
Furthermore, in our study, we have demonstrated
that canertinib and afatinib could influence pancreatic
cancer cell migration, as FAK is regarded as the initiator
of cell migration and cancer metastasis [46]. Additionally,
cancer cell adhesion is shown to be mediated by AKT and
FAK interaction and FAK was shown to be upstream of
AKT activation. In addition, a previous work of our group
have demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of MUC4

in ovarian cancer cells leads to up-regulation of FAK
mediated downstream signaling [47]. Notably, in our study
we have demonstrated the role of pan-EGFR inhibitors in
limiting the migration of pancreatic cancer cells through
FAK mediated pathway. On the other hand, mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase (JNK) and p38, are a family of signaling molecules
that participate in cell survival [48]. Previous reports have
shown that canertinib treatment causes cytotoxicity by
the induction of MAPK phosphorylation through ROS
generation in several cancer cell lines [25]. In this study,
we found that canertinib and afatinib decreases ERK1/2

Figure 7: Overall representation of our study hypothesis and the mechanism by which pan EGFR family irreversible
inhibitors (canertinib and afatinib) induces down regulation of MUC4 and EGFR family proteins to attenuate
proliferation, migration and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. The entire schematic diagram is divided into three sections: (i)
Clinical pathology which illustrated that mucins are aberrantly overexpressed in various cancers including pancreatic cancer and specifically
MUC4. The absence of MUC4 expression in normal pancreas differentiates MUC4 from other mucins to be considered as one of the marker
which is abnormally expressed in pancreatic tumor tissue as well as tumor cell lines. Furthermore, the enhanced MUC4 regulation in
primary tumor initiates complex signaling events, which culminates the process of invasion and distant organ metastasis. (ii) MechanismOur in vitro culture methods have evaluated the mechanism and dual role of pan-EGFR family TKIs in controlling the EGFR family
members as well as mucin specifically MUC4 mediated inhibition of cellular effects.(iii) Integrated/dual inhibition-Extending from the in
vitro methods to in vivo system. Following orthotopic implantation of pancreatic tumor cell line in mouse pancreas, 100% (5/5) of mice
receiving canertinib orally showed significant decrease in tumor weight. Notably, canertinib was more effective in controlling distant organ
metastasis. These results are in conclusion that pan-EGFR family inhibitors are effective in controlling MUC4 mediated pancreatic cancer
pathogenesis advancing towards metastasis, apart from its regular EGFR family members mediated proliferation control.

phosphorylation in pancreatic cancer cells, possibly
through ROS generation. Another important finding
in our current study is that these pan-EGFR inhibitors
significantly inhibit phosphorylation of AKT at Ser-473
in pancreatic cancer cells. Similar observations have
been previously reported in human esophageal cancer
cells [23]. In addition, we found that treatment with panEGFR inhibitors also resulted in down regulation of cell
cycle key regulators such as Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A,
implicating that down regulation of ERK1/2 and AKT
pathways affects cell cycle progression. Moreover, a
recent study has exemplified the novel function of AKT
which promotes FAK auto-phosphorylation for cell
migration and motility [49]. Together these results indicate
that canertinib affects both the proliferative (ERK) and
survival (AKT) pathways.
It has also been described earlier that the irreversible
pan EGFR family inhibitor canertinib can exert its
anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo in various
malignancies such as breast, ovarian, colon, skin and
esophageal cancer [22-24, 26, 50]. It is important to note
that through our in vivo study, we were able to get tumor
growth inhibition at a much lower concentration of 5
mg/kg/day in PBS. In addition we also did not observe
toxicity in the orthotopic in vivo model system. Treatment
with canertinib at 40 mg/kg/day resulted in 69% of tumor
reduction as compared to controls while 80 mg/kg/day
resulted in growth inhibition with wide-spread antitumor
activity in mouse xenograft models [25, 26]. This short
term treatment of canertinib (22 days) decreased tumor
growth and micro and macro metastasis in our pancreatic
cancer xenograft model. Canertinib specifically blocks
phosphorylation and activation of EGFR and HER2
and expression of MUC4 and its associated potential
of metastasis initiation in vivo. Thus, these preclinical
data suggests that partial abolishment of the MUC4
mucin mediated signaling axis along with inhibition
of EGFR family members could be a more effective
approach to combat pancreatic cancer as it inhibits the
crosstalk between multiple pathways and could result
in a highly efficient therapy when used in combination
with primary care of pancreatic cancer. Previously,
the US FDA has approved the combination of erlotinib
with gemcitabine for the treatment of locally advanced
PC patients [2]. However, there are certain front line
benefits of canertinib and afatinib (irreversible TKI),
which makes it a far superior agent than EGFR specific
reversible TKI erlotinib in pancreatic cancer therapy.
Briefly, the advantages are as follows: (i) irreversible
second generation TKI targets all the EGFR family
proteins whereas, reversible TKI targets EGFR alone; (ii)
Irreversible TKI prevents heterodimerization of HER3
with other EGFR family proteins, bur reversible TKI
cannot ; (iii) Sustained clinical impact hence, less dosage
is required for administration (5 and 1 μM of canertinib
and afatinib) whereas the dosage to be administered is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

high, as evidenced by our study (erlotinib 20 μM); and (iv)
Prevents compensatory activation of other EGFR family
members, in contrast reversible TKI activates alternative
HER3 mediated signaling making it difficult to combat the
disease. Canertinib and afatinib differs in their half-life
and effective dosages. Canertinib have half-life of 2-4h
whereas, afatinib has 30-40h [51, 52]. Similarly based on
our in vitro studies, the concentration of canertinib and
afatinib required for the abrogation pancreatic cancer cell
growth is demonstrated as 5 μM and 1 μM, respectively.
Based on these findings, we conclude that panEGFR inhibitor (canertinib or afatinib) will specifically
down regulate EGFR and HER2 and result in an antiproliferative effect in pancreatic cancer cells. It has
also been shown that canertinib can down regulate
MUC4, a molecule that contributes towards pancreatic
cancer aggressiveness. Additionally, we explored the
central mechanism of EGFR; STAT1 mediated MUC4
mucin regulation through siRNA approach. Previous
studies have shown that HER3 and HER4 are regulated
by heterodimerization of EGFR or HER2. Hence, the
change in the total level of EGFR and HER2 in response
to canertinib and afatinib treatment, predicts a possible
inactivation of HER3 and disabling of HER4 mediated
signaling events such as proliferation and apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cells. Thus, these results conclude that
canertinib and afatinib may also target heterodimerization
mediated cellular response which could be a possible
mechanism for the failure of EGFR based targeted
therapy. More importantly, our in vivo studies using
canertinib was also promising in abrogating liver,
diaphragm and spleen metastasis, which are the most
common sites of metastasis in pancreatic cancer patients.
Overall, our results for the first time demonstrate that panEGFR inhibitors (canertinib and afatinib) treatment can
modulate EGFR family members and their downstream
signaling along with MUC4 mucin inhibition, thereby
significantly contributing towards inhibiting pancreatic
cancer cell survival and metastasis (Fig. 7). This study
does shed light on integrated treatments, i.e. chemotherapy
combined with targeted therapies, and could pave the
way for personalized therapy which could lead to a novel
treatment and therapeutic strategy for combating lethal
pancreatic cancer. This study highlights the urgent need
to develop molecular targeted therapy in combination
with chemotherapeutic agents to inhibit mucins and its
associated signaling molecules in pancreatic cancer. In
summary, our results demonstrate that canertinib and
afatinib as attractive drugs to inhibit the pancreatic cancer
growth and metastasis when it is used along with other
traditional cytotoxic agents like gemcitabine or abraxane
in clinical studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

cells were incubated with the following antibodies to
detect their localization pattern: anti-MUC4, anti-HER2
and anti-EGFR (Supplementary Table 1). Following
primary antibody incubation, cells were incubated with
FITC conjugated anti-mouse (MUC4 & EGFR), Texas
red-conjugated anti-rabbit (HER2) and DAPI for nuclear
staining. Advanced laser scanning confocal microscopy
was performed using an LSCM 710 camera (Carl Zeiss
GmbH, Jena, Germany) [14, 15, 45].
Similarly, confocal analysis was also performed
in EGFR-siRNA and scramble-siRNA transfected cells
after 96 hours. Transient transfection and confocal
immunofluorescence analysis were performed as described
previously [15, 45]. Anti-EGFR and anti-MUC4 antibodies
used in this study were briefly described Supplementary
Table 1. Appropriate secondary antibodies such as Goat
anti-Rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Flour red (568) for
EGFR and Alexa Flour green (488) Goat anti-Mouse for
MUC4 were used for immunofluorescence detection of
pancreatic cancer cells.

Cell lines and reagents
CD18/HPAF, Capan-1 and MiaPaCa-1 pancreatic
cancer cells and human immortalized pancreatic ductal
epithelial cells hTERT-HPNE were purchased from ATCC
and were maintained as per the ATCC recommendations
and based on our previous publications [11, 12, 14, 45].
The pan EGFR family members specific and EGFR
specific inhibitors used in this study (Selleck Chemicals,
TX, USA) were dissolved in either DMSO (canertinib and
erlotinib) or in PBS (afatinib) and stored at -20°C as per
the manufacturer’s recommendation.

Growth inhibition assay
For the growth inhibition assay, 3X104 pancreatic
cancer cells and human telomerase reverse transcriptase
immortalized normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial
cells hTERT-HPNE were plated into flat-bottomed 96well plates (Costar, Corning, NY). After 24 hours, various
concentrations of canertinib (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 μM),
afatinib (0, 500nM, 750 nM 1 and 2 μM) and erlotinib
(0, 5, 20 and 40 μM) were added to the pancreatic cancer
cells and they were incubated for an additional 24 hours.
Subsequently, MTT assay was performed as per the
standard procedure [45].

Colony forming assay
Colony forming assays were performed as described
previously [53]. Briefly, cell survival was determined by
plating approximately 0.1-0.3X104 (CD18/HPAF and
Capan-1) cells/well in a six-well plate in triplicates. After
24 hours of incubation with complete media, 5 and 1µM
concentration of canertinib and afatinib were added and
further incubated for 10 days at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. The control cells were incubated
with 0.01% of DMSO. The cells were harvested and fixed
with 100% methanol, stained with 0.4% crystal violet in
methanol and colonies were counted using Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) [53].

Transfection studies
CD18/HPAF pancreatic cancer cells (0.5 X106)
were seeded into 60 mm culture dishes. After 24 hour,
cells were transiently transfected with a pool of four
siRNA oligonucleotides specific for human EGFR (100
pmol) (MU-003114-01-002, siGENOME SMART
pool, Dharmacon Research, Inc., Lafayette, CO) using
DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent as per manufacturer’s
instructions for 96 hours. Non-targeting (siRNAs)
oligonucleotides were used as transfection control.
The transfected cells were harvested 96 hours after
transfection. The lysates were collected and analyzed for
EGFR, phospho-STAT1 and MUC4 protein expression by
western blotting analysis.

Migration and wound healing assay
The transwell migration and wound healing
assays in pancreatic cancer cells under various treatment
conditions were performed with slight modifications
as described previously [11, 14, 35, 45]. Trans-well
migration assay were performed using modified boyden
chamber consisting of a cell culture inserts with 8-μm pore
size, polyethylene terephthalate track-etched membrane
(Falcon#353093) of six well format seated into a six
well cell culture plates. Briefly, pancreatic cancer cells
CD18/HPAF and Capan-1 were counted and suspended
in a serum free DMEM at a density of 1x106/well. The
bottom chamber of the six well plate were added with
2.0 ml of 10% FBS (Chemotaxis movement) in DMEM.
The corresponding drug canertinib (5 μM) or 0.01%
DMSO (control) were also added to cell suspension in the
serum free medium and seeded into the upper chamber of
insert. The migrations of cells were allowed for 24 hour

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy
The methods employed for confocal analysis were
previously described from our group [14, 15]. Pancreatic
cancer cells (5X104) were grown on sterilized cover slips
for 24 hours and treated with appropriate DMSO (vehicle
control), canertinib and afatinib inhibitors at 5 and 1 µM
concentrations and further incubated for 24 hours. Briefly,

in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells
that invaded through 8-μm pores into the Trans-well cell
culture chamber were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick
cell staining kit (Dade Behring, Inc.). The pancreatic
cancer cells that migrated towards the lower surface of the
culture chamber were counted in 12 random fields under
a light microscope. Similarly, a wound healing assay was
performed to study the pancreatic cancer cell migration
under canertinib and afatinib treatment conditions.
Pancreatic cancer cells CD18/HPAF and Capan-1 were
seeded at a density of 2x106/well supplemented with 10%
FBS in DMEM. After overnight incubation and obtaining
confluent (>90%) cultures, an artificial wound was created
using a 200μl sterile pipette tip. The culture plates were
washed with PBS to remove the damaged and detached
cells. Cells were treated with drugs such as canertinib (5
μM), afatinib (1 μM) and 0.01% DMSO vehicle control
were added into the DMED medium containing 10% FBS
for 24 hour. Images were taken at 0 and 24 hours at 10X
magnification using Accu-scope microscope assisted with
Moticam 580 digital camera. The wound closure was
calculated by measuring the distance between two edges of
wounds using Image J software. Twelve independent areas
in the wound per image were counted in arbitrary units
using a straight line tool in the image j software. The mean
distance between the wound edges at twelve independent
areas of the control and treatment at 0 and 24 hour was
calculated and the arbitrary units were converted into
percentage as follows. % of wound remaining = (Mean
area of measurement at 24 h/ Mean area of measurement
at 0h) multiplied by 100. Further, the percentage of wound
closure was calculated as: 100% - % of wound remaining
[11, 14, 35, 45].

DMSO (control); (ii) 5 μM canertinib; (iii) 1 μM
afatinib. Whole-cell lysates having approximately 40
μg of proteins were resolved on 10% SDS–PAGE and
subjected to western blotting using list of antibodies
described in supplementary Table 1. For the separation
of high molecular weight MUC4 protein we will resolve
40 μg of proteins lysates on a 2% SDS agarose gel. After
appropriate secondary antibody incubation the bands were
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
method (Thermo scientific).

In vivo mice model studies
The study was performed based on IACUC protocol
approved by the UNMC Animal Ethics Committee and as
per the NIH guidance of the care and use of laboratory
animals. Four to six week-old female athymic nude
mice (n=5 for each group) were obtained from NIH and
maintained in pathogen free conditions in the institutional
animal facility. To establish tumor growth in mice, 0.5×106
of CD18/HPAF luciferase tagged cells, suspended in 100
µl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were orthotopically
implanted into the mouse pancreas. Initially the tumors
were allowed to grow for 10 days without treatment and
animals were randomized into two groups of 5 animals
each based on the fluorescence image quantification
identified using Xenogen optical in vivo imaging system
(IVIS). Group 1 acted as control and was given PBS as
vehicle control; group 2 was given canertinib alone. The
treatment schedules were as follows: canertinib was given
orally 5 days a week with 5 mg/kg/day in PBS and control
mice received intraperitoneal (i/p) injection of PBS as
vehicle control. Further, these animals were (i/p) injected
with luciferin and were subjected to imaging using IRIS
machine, at time points 0, 8, 15 and 22 days of treatment.
The emitted photons were calculated using Living image
software version 4.4. After four weeks of treatment, all
the animals were sacrificed by aspiration with CO2;
tumors were removed and weighed. Metastatic sites were
observed and the respective tumor and metastatic organs
were collected for immunohistochemistry and protein
analysis.

RNA isolation and reverse transcription PCR
analysis
RNA isolation and PCR amplification conditions
were followed as described previously [12]. RNA
was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, Valenica, CA, U.S.A.) and its concentration
was determined using a NanoDrop ND 1000
Spectrophotometer. cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg
RNA, oligo(dT)18 primer, and Super Script II RNase
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed
for MUC4 using the primer sequences: Forward primer
5’-CGCGGTGGTGGAGGCGTTCTT-3’ and reverse
primer 5’- GAAGAATCCTGACAGCCTTCA-3′. β-actin
was used as an internal control [12].

Histological,
immunohistochemical
immunoblot studies

To analyze histological changes associated with
canertinib treatment along with control PBS treatment
mice, we fixed the tumor specimens in 10% buffered
formalin solution overnight and subsequently embedded
in paraffin wax. Pancreatic tissue sections and various
metastatic organs were cut at 5μm thickness and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical
analysis was also performed on the same sections of
pancreas isolated from the control and inhibitor treated

Immunoblotting
Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [14, 15]. Briefly, pancreatic cancer cells were
