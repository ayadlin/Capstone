BACKGROUND: Lonafarnib (LNF) is a protein farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitor that has shown synergistic activity
with taxanes in preclinical models and early stage clinical trials. Preclinical findings suggested tubulin acetylation and
FTase expression levels may be important determinants of drug sensitivity that would help identify patient populations more likely to benefit from this regimen. This pilot study evaluated the biological effects of LNF and docetaxel
(DTX) combination therapy in refractory solid tumors by comparing pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies.
METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies refractory to
standard therapies or with no effective therapies available were eligible. Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 dosing
cohorts: 1) 30 mg/m2, 100 mg; 2) 36 mg/m2, 100 mg; 3) 30 mg/m2, 150 mg; or 4) 36 mg/m2, 150mg of DTX intravenously weekly, LNF orally twice daily, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients enrolled, 36 were treated, and 29
were evaluable for toxicity and response assessment. The combination of LNF and DTX was tolerated in all cohorts
with the exception of a 28% incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea, which was manageable with aggressive antidiarrheal
regimens. Seven patients derived clinically meaningful benefit from this combination treatment; these patients had
significantly lower basal FTase-beta mRNA expression levels than the mean study population level (P < .05). Correlation of clinical benefit with tubulin acetylation content as well as basal acetyl-tubulin content were evaluated. However, no significant correlation was found. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small number of patients, these findings
support our preclinical mechanistic studies and warrant further clinical investigations using FTase-beta mRNA expression as a potential predictive biomarker to select for an enriched patient population to study the effects of taxane

Lonafarnib (SCH 66,336) is a small molecule inhibitor of farnesyl transferase (FTase), which adds a 15-carbon farnesyl group to several G-proteins important in intracellular signaling involved in cell survival, including Ras, RhoB, Pxf, Rap2,
and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase.1-3 Mutations in the Ras family of oncogenes are common in human cancers4 and have
been associated with shortened survival in several human tumor types.5,6 Because Ras farnesylation was found to be required
for its membrane localization and thus its oncogene activation,7-9 lonafarnib and other FTase inhibitors (FTIs) were developed as potential Ras inhibitors and were shown to inhibit Ras function.3,10,11 However, farnesylation of other proteins has

also been shown to be involved in the antitumor effects of
lonafarnib and other FTIs.12-22 Despite its modest singleagent activity, lonafarnib has shown highly synergistic activity in combination with taxanes in preclinical models
and early stage clinical trials.23-34
Members of our team reported the initial phase 1 trial
of lonafarnib in combination with paclitaxel and determined the recommended phase 2 doses to be lonafarnib
100 mg twice a day and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 21
days.35 The subsequent phase 2 trial of lonafarnib and
paclitaxel in taxane-refractory nonsmall cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) reported promising antitumor activity, a partial
response (PR) rate of 10% (3 of 29 patients) and a stable
disease (SD) rate of 38% (11 of 29 patients).30 The ability
to overcome taxane resistance would have significant clinical impact given the wide range of neoplastic diseases
treated with taxane-based therapy. However, the phase 2
trial did not provide data that could be used to elucidate
the biological basis for overcoming taxane resistance.
Our group also demonstrated that lonafarnib not
only synergizes with microtubule-stabilizing taxanes in
vitro, but it also is able to reverse taxane resistance in
drug-resistant cancer models.24,25 Mechanistically, we
have shown lonafarnib synergizes with taxanes through inhibition of tubulin deacetylase, histone deacetylase 6
(HDAC6), which leads to increased tubulin acetylation,
microtubule stability, and enhanced taxane binding to
microtubules.24,25 In addition, we have shown that FTase
physically associates with HDAC6 and microtubules
(docetaxel’s target) and that FTase knockdown sensitizes
cells to lonafarnib/taxane drug combination.36 Taken together, these preclinical findings suggested tubulin acetylation and basal FTase expression levels may be important
determinants of drug sensitivity that would help us identify patients more likely to benefit from the combination
of lonafarnib and docetaxel.
The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the biological effects of combination therapy with lonafarnib
and docetaxel in refractory solid tumors by comparing
pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies. Tumor
specimens were evaluated for effective drug-target engagement, biologic interactions, surrogate markers of biologic
activity, and potential predictive markers of benefit. Secondary goals were to determine safety, tolerability, toxicity profile, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity
of the combination of lonafarnib and docetaxel.
Patients were randomized into 4 cohorts of 9 patients
with different doses of lonafarnib and docetaxel. Within
each cohort, patients were randomly subdivided into 3 sep-

4050

arate subgroups receiving their post-treatment biopsy after
docetaxel alone, lonafarnib alone, and docetaxel/lonafarnib
combined. This randomization scheme would potentially
allow us to identify what impact, if any, different doses of
the FTI/taxane combination have on microtubule stabilization and farnesyl transferase inhibition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed locally
advanced or metastatic solid malignancies refractory to
standard therapies; age 18 years; tumor accessible for
repeat biopsy; ECOG performance status of 2; life expectancy 12 weeks; discontinuation of potent CYP3A4
inducers/inhibitors; adequate laboratory values including
leukocyte count 3000 cells/mm3, absolute neutrophil
count 1500 cells/mm3, platelet count 100,000/mm3,
hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL, total bilirubin level less than or
equals to the upper limit of normal (ULN), albumin 2.5
g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase 2  ULN, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time 1.5  ULN. Women of childbearing
potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test.
Exclusion criteria included greater than grade 2 neuropathy
and inability to swallow pills. All study subjects signed an
informed consent form approved by the Emory University
Institutional Review Board.
Study Design
Patients were enrolled from April 2006 to April 2008.
The primary objective was to determine the molecular
interaction between docetaxel and lonafarnib in tumor
samples. Secondary objectives included 1) determination
of the safety and toxicity of docetaxel in combination with
lonafarnib, 2) determination of pharmacokinetic interactions, 3) determination of molecular interactions between
docetaxel and lonafarnib in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
Study subjects were randomly assigned (Fig. 1) to 1
of 4 dosing cohorts, 1) 30 mg/m2, 100 mg; 2) 36 mg/m2,
100 mg; 3) 30 mg/m2, 150mg; or 4) 36 mg/m2, 150 mg
of docetaxel intravenously weekly, lonafarnib orally twice
daily, respectively. Lonafarnib capsules were administered
twice daily, and docetaxel was administered weekly for 3
weeks every 28 days. Premedication for docetaxel
included a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone.
All patients underwent pretreatment tumor biopsies
1 week before drug administration. By using a second

randomization, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of
3 schedules for a second tumor biopsy. Group 1 was
treated with docetaxel alone on day 1, repeat biopsy on
day 2, and then initiation of lonafarnib treatment. Group
2 was treated with lonafarnib alone on day 1, repeat biopsy before dosing on day 5, and then docetaxel initiation. Group 3 was treated with lonafarnib on day 1,
docetaxel on day 4, and repeat biopsy on day 5, before
lonafarnib.
Dose modification was permitted. A single 25%
dose reduction of docetaxel due to toxicity was permitted,
and all subsequent treatments were administered at the
reduced dose. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (without fever)
with recovery before the next planned cycle did not
require dose modification. Doses of docetaxel were also
held for abnormal liver function, alkaline phosphatase >2
 ULN, bilirubin >ULN.
A single dose reduction of lonafarnib due to toxicity
was permitted. All subsequent treatments were at the
reduced dose (150 mg twice daily was reduced to 100 mg
twice daily; 100 mg twice daily was reduced to 100 mg in
the morning and 50 mg in the evening). Doses of lonafarnib were held for grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia until
platelet counts returned to 100,000/mm3. Grade 3 or 4
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea required discontinuation of
lonafarnib until toxicities returned to grade 1 or better,
and subsequent doses were reduced by 1 level.

Study subjects were removed from the study for the
following reasons: 1) patient request, 2) progressive disease, 3) unacceptable toxicity, 4) investigator judgment.
Baseline tumor evaluation with cross-sectional
imaging was performed within 4 weeks of therapy initiation, and subsequent imaging was performed every 8
weeks. Tumor response was determined by using the
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria.
Pharmacokinetics
Sampling

Blood samples (6 mL) were collected in sodium heparinized at times 0 (pre), 1, 1.25, 1.75, 4, 7.5, and 24
hours after docetaxel infusion. Lonafarnib maximum
steady-state concentrations, Css(max), were collected for
each patient based on twice daily administration for 3 or 4
days before docetaxel administration. Samples were immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C;
plasma was removed, separated into 3 aliquots, and stored
at 70 C.
Analytic Methods

Lonafarnib concentrations were analyzed at Taylor
Technology (Princeton, New Jersey) using liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometric
detection (LC-MS/MS) with a lower limit of

quantification (LLQ) of 5 ng/mL and a linear concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. Docetaxel concentrations
were assayed at Pharmaceutical Product Development
(PPD, Richmond, Virginia) by LC-MS/MS with a LLQ
of 10 ng/mL (10-5000 ng/mL).
Data Analysis

Individual pharmacokinetic parameters for docetaxel were calculated from plasma concentration-time
curves by WinNonlin v 5.2 (Pharsight, Mountain View,
California) using noncompartmental methods. Parameters reported included area under the concentration-time
curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), terminal half-life
(t1/2), clearance (CL), and volume of distribution (Vd).
Lonafarnib Css(max) values are reported because of inconsistent acquisition of other time points in the sampling
scheme.
Tissue Procurement
Each tumor biopsy specimen was divided into 3 portions
and processed as follows: flash frozen, embedded in paraffin, and the remainder saved for microtubule analysis.
Samples for microtubule analysis were immediately fixed
with complete PHEMO buffer.37
Tissue Microtubule Integrity and Stability
Assessment by Immunofluorescence Staining
Followed by Confocal Microscopy
For immunofluorescence processing, tumor biopsies were
processed, imaged, and analyzed.37 Images were acquired
using a Zeiss 5LIVE confocal microscope with a 63/1.3
NA objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmgH,
Germany).
Immunofluorescence of Acetylated Tubulin in
PBMCs
PBMCs were centrifuged at 500 RPM for 5 minutes onto
poly-lysine–treated cover slips then fixed in PHEMO
buffer (68 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, pH 6.9, 15 mM
EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 10% [vol/vol] DMSO).23-25,38,39
Confocal z-sections were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510
META microscope23,38,39 and analyzed using Metamorph 6.0 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmgH, Germany).
Immunohistochemistry for Acetylated Tubulin
Immunohistochemistry for acetylated tubulin was performed at the Molecular Cytology Core Facility of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center using a Discovery
XT processor (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Arizona) and a monoclonal antiacetylated tubulin antibody

4052

(Sigma clone 6-11B-1; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri), followed by biotinylated mouse secondary antibody (Vector Labs, Burlingame, California), streptavidinHRP D (Ventana Medical Systems) and DAB Detection
Kit (Ventana Medical Systems). Stained tissue sections
were mounted on glass slides and scanned using the
ZEISS MIRAX SCAN. TIFF images of tissue sections
were obtained using MIRAX Viewer Software. The tumor
area in each slide was delineated by a pathologist and levels of tubulin acetylation were assessed in the defined tumor area using Metamorph. The threshold level of
acetylated tubulin was determined, and the intensity of
the resultant image was expressed as a percentage of the
total intensity in the tumor area .
FTase Alpha and Beta mRNA Expression
Total RNA was isolated from fresh frozen tumor biopsies
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California).
cDNA was prepared from 1 lg total RNA by using random primers and High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit from Applied Biosystems (Foster City,
California). Real-time PCR reactions were prepared using
SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, California).
Primers for FTase alpha were 50 -TGATCGTGCTG
TATTGGAGAG-30 and 50 -CTGTGCTGTGTTTGCT
TTGAA-30 ; primers for FTase beta were 50 -TACTATT
GCCCTCCATCTTCCTCC-30 and 50 -GACCTCTTG
GATCTTTTCTTCTAC-30 ; primers for glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were 50 -GGAGT
CAACGGATTTGGTCG-30 and 50 -CTTGATTTTGG
AGGGATCTCG-30 . Quantification was performed
using Applied Biosystems (ABI) Prism 7700 Real-time
qPCR system under the following cycling conditions:
(step 1) 50̊C (2 minutes); (step 2) 95̊C (10 minutes); (step
3) 40 cycles of 95̊C (15 seconds), and 60̊C (1 minutes).
The fluorescence threshold value was determined using
SDS and RQ Manager software. The relative expression
level of FTase alpha or FTase beta was normalized using
GAPDH as an internal standard (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, Calif). The Ct value for each FTalpha and
FTbeta expression was determined and normalized to the
Ct value obtained with GAPDH from the same samples.
The mean of all normalized FTase alpha or beta expression values from all samples was set to 1.
Statistical Analysis
FTase expression was dichotomized into low or high
expression for each patient based on the median of sample
delta Ct value. Kaplan-Meier product limit estimators

(PFS) stratified by FTase expression levels (low vs high). A
log-rank test was performed. PFS was defined as the time
interval from the start of treatment to disease progression.
For each patient, the change in acetylated tubulin
staining was categorized as having either increased or
decreased on the basis of the change of acetylated tubulin
levels before and after treatment. Kaplan-Meier product
limit estimators stratified by change in acetylated tubulin
were generated for PFS. The log-rank test was performed.

RESULTS
Of 38 patients enrolled, 36 were treated, and 29 were
evaluable for toxicity and response assessment (Table 1).
All patients underwent tumor biopsies; however, because
of technical reasons (eg, insufficient tumor sample in biopsy specimen), several patients did not have adequate
paired biopsies for molecular analysis.

3/4, 6%), hypophosphatemia (all grades, 25%; grade 3/4,
0%), and thrombocytopenia (all grades, 25%; grade 3/4,
9%). Hyperglycemia was a common finding and most
likely due to protocol mandated dexamethasone premedication before docetaxel infusion. All episodes of hyperglycemia were treated with either oral agents (ie, glyburide,
metformin) or subcutaneous insulin. Drug-induced leukopenia resolved within 1 week of delayed treatment.
Three deaths occurred during the study. One patient
died because of aspiration pneumonia in the setting of
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. A second patient
died because of complications of urosepsis in the setting
of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The third patient
death was due to rapidly progressing community-acquired
pneumococcal sepsis, which was not thought to be related
to study treatment because the patient’s neutrophil counts
were in the normal range.
Efficacy
Clinical benefit was defined as SD, PR, or complete
response (CR). Seven patients clinically benefitted from
treatment with docetaxel and lonafarnib (Table 3). One
patient with parotid carcinoma had a CR, and 6 patients
had SD lasting from 6 to 10 months. Of note, several of
the patients who benefitted from protocol therapy had
documented disease progression when previously treated
with taxanes, 1 patient with prior docetaxel treatment and
5 patients with prior paclitaxel treatment.
Pharmacokinetic Data
For docetaxel, the AUC0-inf and t1/2values were only
reported for patients in whom concentrations were above
the LLQ at 24 hours, allowing for a full set of values for
parameter calculations (n ¼ 13; Fig. 2A). Comparing
docetaxel exposure in the presence and absence of lonafarnib at steady-state concentrations, a trend toward

increased docetaxel exposure as measured by Cmax and
AUC0-inf values in patients receiving the combination was
seen; however, this did not correspond with greater clinical efficacy or toxicity. Median docetaxel dose-normalized
AUC0-inf was compared between groups receiving and not
receiving lonafarnib (Fig. 2B) and showed no difference
in mean AUC0-inf values, despite a numeric trend (P ¼

values increased in a dose-dependent fashion.

acetylation. Because of the need to validate multiple biomarkers and limited tissue supply, we were able to identify
only evaluable tumor areas with matched pretreatment
and post-treatment biopsies in 9 patients. In 2 patients
who clinically benefitted, 1 showed a robust increase in
tubulin acetylation (60% at baseline to 100% post-treatment) while the second did not show a significant change
(70% to 80%) (Figs. 3 and 4). Among the 7 patients who
did not clinically benefit, 3 patients showed no increase in
the levels of tubulin acetylation, while 4 patients had a
20%-70% increase. We also investigated whether basal
acetyl-tubulin content could serve as a predictive biomarker of benefit. However, all evaluable pretreatment
samples from patients who benefitted had levels of tubulin
acetylation of greater than 40%, as did those patients who
did not benefit.
FTase expression in pretreatment biopsies

Quantitative real-time polymerase-chain reaction
(RT-PCR) for FTase-alpha and FTase-beta mRNA was
performed in 28 baseline tumor samples. Results were
normalized to GAPDH expression and categorized into
low or high expression for each patient based on the median of sample delta CT values. Kaplan-Meier analysis
indicated that patients with low FTase-alpha expression
had a trend toward improved survival, albeit not significant (P ¼ .1145) (Fig. 5A). Log-rank test showed that the
Cancer

difference in PFS between patients with low versus high
FTase-beta expression was statistically significantly different (P < .05; Fig. 5B).
Tubulin acetylation analysis in PBMCs

Pretreatment and post-treatment levels of acetylated
tubulin in PBMCs did not correlate with PFS (P ¼
.4986).

DISCUSSION
This National Cancer Institute (NCI P01)-funded, translational, biomarker-driven, clinical trial investigated the
interaction between docetaxel and lonafarnib, evaluating
molecular predictors of outcome as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Our previous
clinical and mechanistic studies suggested lonafarnib
could reverse taxane resistance.24,30 However, the biological basis of this finding was not well understood. Mechanistically, we have shown that the synergy between
taxanes and FTIs could be explained by FTIs ability to inhibit the tubulin deacetylase function of HDAC6, leading
to microtubule stabilization, enhanced tubulin acetylation, and taxane binding.24,25,28,36
Of the 36 patients treated, 7 patients derived benefit from protocol treatment. Remarkably, 6 of these
patients had previously failed taxane-based therapy; thus,

benefitted, no difference in exposure was seen compared
with those who did not benefit, suggesting factors other
than plasma drug concentrations contributed to the likelihood of benefit.

in tubulin acetylation in post-treatment biopsies and the
actual clinical response of individual patients, which were
attributable to the small number of biopsies with analyzable tumors areas and the high baseline level of tubulin
acetylation. Because most subjects had failed prior taxane
chemotherapy, it is possible that tubulin acetylation analysis was biased by prior treatment. When examining tumor biopsy specimens as well as PBMCs for changes in
levels of acetylated tubulin, immunofluorescence did not
reveal a statistically significant correlation with PFS. Interestingly, microtubule disruption, evinced by microtubule
bundling or aberrant mitosis, did not always lead to cell
death nor was it associated with clinical response (data not
shown). This suggests additional pathways downstream of
microtubule targeting are dysregulated, potentially

through the overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins like
Bcl2 or deficient spindle assembly checkpoints.43
Recent studies from our group have revealed cells
with a stable knockdown of FTase were sensitized to taxane and lonafarnib alone or in combination.36 Similar
results were obtained with FTase-beta knockdown, leading us to hypothesize that patients with lower FTase
expression at baseline could potentially show a better
response to this combination. Indeed, patients that benefitted from treatment had statistically significantly lower
basal mRNA expression levels of FTase-beta compared
with the mean mRNA expression levels for the study
population. Lower basal mRNA expression levels of
FTase-alpha were also seen in the 7 patients who clinically benefited; however, this association did not reach
statistical significance. These clinical observations are in
agreement with our previous studies in which knockdown of FTase-alpha resulted in concomitant downregulation of FTase-beta subunit and vice versa because the 2
subunits are cotranslationally regulated. However, in the
clinical samples, we did not observe such a coordinated
expression for the 2 subunits, suggesting that in patients,
additional pathways may affect the expression of each
subunit individually. Our data from the current trial also
show FTase-beta may be a more accurate biomarker than
FTase-alpha for predicting clinical benefit to lonafarnib/
docetaxel, possibly due to the finding that FTase and geranylgeranyl transferase exist as alpha and beta heterodimers and share a common alpha subunit but a
homologous beta subunit (25% sequence identity).
Therefore, FTase-beta would be expected to be a more
specific biomarker for FTase activity than FTasealpha.44,45 Moreover, mutations in FTase that confer resistance to lonafarnib have been described at residue
betaY361 both in vitro and in patients46; the presence of
such a mutation could explain the lack of clinical benefit
from the lonafarnib/docetaxel combination.
During the conception of this trial, we set the ambitious goal of prospectively collecting tumor samples from
all participants before and after treatment. Although we
had a well thought out plan, unforeseen technical issues
precluded us from obtaining adequate amounts of viable
tumor tissue for all our planned correlative studies. Many
of our samples contained necrotic debris or little malignant tissue limiting our ability to complete all planned
testing. Given the small number of paired biopsies, we
were unable to investigate the impact of administering
lonafarnib versus docetaxel versus the combination, had
on molecular endpoints. Nor were we able to definitively

correlate pretreatment and post-treatment acetylation levels with clinical benefit. In future studies investigating
molecular endpoints, we suggest having a pathologist at
bedside during biopsy to confirm the presence of adequate
tumor cells so as to improve tumor collection rates and
quality of specimens collected.
Overall, the regimen of docetaxel and lonafarnib
appears to be tolerable. The most common toxicities of
diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were mostly grade 1/2
and manageable with oral regimens. We do acknowledge
a moderate (28%) incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea, but
with aggressive antidiarrheal medications, we found the
trial regimen tolerable. Hyperglycemia was most likely
related to dexamethasone premedication but was manageable with oral hypoglycemics or insulin. Of the 3
deaths that occurred during the study, 2 were studyrelated (sepsis in the setting of chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia); the third death was thought to be unrelated to study treatment (rapidly progressing community-acquired pneumococcal sepsis). There is no evidence
that lonafarnib enhanced docetaxel-induced neutropenia;
it bears mentioning that the study population was extensively pretreated. During the course of the trial, enrollment was suspended after each patient death, and the
clinical data were reviewed by the Emory University,
Winship Cancer Institute Data Safety Monitoring Board
(WCI-DSMB). Accrual was reopened only after the
WCI-DSMB found the risks to participants were
acceptable.
This study highlights the feasibility and potential
utility of incorporating serial tumor biopsies into clinical
trials. As in previous trials, investigating the combination
of lonafarnib and taxanes, we observed several patients
with clinical benefit despite pretreatment with taxanes in
prior regimens. However, unlike previous studies, we
were able to identify mRNA expression levels of FTasebeta and FTase-alpha as potential predictive biomarkers.
This study also stresses the importance of National Cancer
Institute funding through the P01 mechanism to support
correlative translational research to go from bedside to
bench (early clinical trials of taxanes and lonafarnib) and
then back to bedside (mechanistic studies on lonafarnib
and taxane synergy) to confirm preclinical observation of
mechanisms of FTI-enhanced effects of taxanes.3,24,25,30,35,36,47,48 Although the agent, lonafarnib, is
unlikely to be developed further by the pharmaceutical
industry, the data gathered during the conduct of this
study may prove to be a valuable step forward in the personalization of cancer care.
