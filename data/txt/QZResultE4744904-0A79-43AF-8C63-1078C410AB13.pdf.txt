Abstract
Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV; also named
human herpesvirus 8) is necessary but not sufficient for the
development of Kaposi’s sarcoma. A variety of factors may
contribute to the pathogenesis of Kaposi’s sarcoma in addition
to KSHV. Marijuana is a widely used recreational agent, and
#9-tetrahydrocannabinol (#9-THC), the major active component of marijuana, is prescribed for medicinal use. To evaluate
how cannabinoids may affect the pathogenesis of Kaposi’s
sarcoma, we studied primary human dermal microvascular
endothelial cells (HMVEC) exposed to KSHV. There was an
increased efficiency of KSHV infection in the presence of low
doses of #9-THC. We also found that #9-THC increased the
viral load in KSHV-infected HMVEC through activation of the
KSHV lytic switch gene, the open reading frame 50. Furthermore, we observed that #9-THC stimulated expression of
the KSHV-encoded viral G protein–coupled receptor and
Kaposi’s sarcoma cell proliferation. Our results indicate that
#9-THC can enhance KSHV infection and replication and
foster KSHV-mediated endothelial transformation. Thus, use
of cannabinoids may place individuals at greater risk for the
development and progression of Kaposi’s sarcoma. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the etiologic
agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma, is not sufficient for the development of
Kaposi’s sarcoma. This is highlighted by the observation that most
KSHV infections are asymptomatic, and >95% of persons who
become infected never develop Kaposi’s sarcoma or other KSHVrelated cancers (1, 2). It seems that certain cofactors participate in
the development of Kaposi’s sarcoma mainly through suppression
of the immune system (3, 4). Whereas the immune system of
healthy adults usually holds the virus in check, AIDS patients (5),
transplant recipients (6), and other immunocompromised patients
are at risk for Kaposi’s sarcoma (7) if they are KSHV infected.
Marijuana, the prototypical cannabinoid, has been used as a
recreational, ceremonial, and therapeutic substance throughout
history. Although cannabinoids display a series of promising
therapeutic potentials (8, 9), marijuana and other cannabinoids
may impair both cell-mediated and humoral immune system
function, leading to decreased resistance to infection by viruses

and bacteria (10–12). Hence, marijuana smoking has been
postulated to act as a possible cofactor in the development of
Kaposi’s sarcoma, as it predisposes human immunodeficiency
virus–positive individuals to opportunistic infections and Kaposi’s
sarcoma (13–15). A previous study showed that D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (D9-THC) inhibited the lytic replication of KSHV in B cells
by modulating the expression of open reading frame 50 (ORF50;
ref. 16). However, these results cannot be extrapolated to the case
of Kaposi’s sarcoma because its lesions are mainly composed of
spindle cells, which seem to be of lymphatic endothelial origin (17).
Furthermore, the transcriptional profiling of KSHV genes is
different in endothelial cells and B cells (18). Thus, the effects of
cannabinoids on KSHV are not yet characterized. D9-THC is highly
lipophilic and can change membrane permeability (19), suggesting
that this cannabinoid could modulate KSHV entry into the
endothelium. Moreover, D9-THC initiates a signaling cascade that
could modulate cellular susceptibility to KSHV and alter the viral
life cycle, as well as promote viral strategies of immune evasion. For
these reasons, the potential risks versus benefits of cannabinoids
need to be explored in KSHV-associated diseases.
Here, we report that low doses of D9-THC, similar to those
achieved in vivo, facilitated KSHV infection in endothelial cells
through enhancement of cell-cell interactions and endocytosis. We
further show that D9-THC up-regulated the expression of both the
lytic switch gene ORF50 and the carcinogenic KSHV G protein–
coupled receptor (GPCR), thereby increasing viral titers in culture
and inducing endothelial cell transformation. These results suggest
that low doses of D9-THC may foster the initiation of Kaposi’s
sarcoma and contribute to its progression and spread.

Materials and Methods
Cells. Primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC;
adult) were purchased from Cambrex, Inc. and maintained in EBM-2
medium with EGM-2MV SingleQuots. Recombinant green fluorescent
protein (GFP)-KSHV–carrying BCBL-1 cells (GFP-BCBL-1) were a gift from
Dr. Jeffrey Vieira (Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of
Washington, Seattle, WA). BJAB is a line of KSHV- and EBV-negative human
B cells. GFP-BCBL-1 and BJAB cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 units/mL
penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine.
Drugs. D9-THC was purchased as a stock solution of 1 mg/mL in
methanol from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The CB1 selective antagonist AM251 was
purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. The CB2 selective antagonist AM630
was purchased from Tocris Bioscience. O-1918 [( )-4-(3-3, 4-trans-pmenthadien-(1, 8)-yl)-orcinol] was synthesized as described (20) and
dissolved in ethanol.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total cell RNA was extracted by using the
RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen, Inc. Primers for CB1 [5¶-GCCTGGCGGTGGCAGACCTCC-3¶ (upstream) and 5¶-GCAGCACGGCGATCACAATGG-3¶
(downstream)] or for CB2 [5¶-CATGGAGGAATGCTGGGTGAC-3¶ (upstream)

(RT-PCR) was done by using the Titanium One-Step RT-PCR kit (BD
Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Viral infection. GFP-KSHV was purified and used for the viral infection
assay as described previously (21, 22). About 60% confluent cells were either
mock infected or infected with GFP-KSHV in the presence or absence of
different concentrations of D9-THC in 24-well plates at 37jC for 3 h, then
washed, and incubated at 37jC for 3 days with growth medium. The
percentage of infection was calculated and shown.
Real-time DNA PCR and real-time RT-PCR. KSHV-infected HMVEC
and GFP-BCBL-1 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of D9-THC
or vehicle control for 7 days. Viral DNA from the supernatant and cells
was then isolated by using the viral nucleic acid purification kit (Roche
Applied Science). KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA-1)
gene copies were measured by using real-time DNA PCR technology.
The primers and Taqman probe were synthesized as described previously
(23). In the meantime, total cell RNA was extracted from KSHV-infected
HMVEC. Real-time RT-PCR technology was used to determine the expression of KSHV ORF50. The primers were as follows: 5¶-CGCAATGCGTTACGTTGTTG-3¶ ( forward primer) and 5¶-GCCCGGACTGTTGAATCG-3¶
(reverse primer). The Taqman probe was 6FAM-ACCTGTGCCCCCTCTTCGACACC-TAMRA. The primers and Taqman probe were synthesized by BioScience International, Inc. A real-time PCR assay was done in
duplicate for each standard and sample by using the ABI Prism 7700
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The amplification of 18S
RNA served as an endogenous control for ORF50 expression. The relative

quantification value was calculated by using the DDC t method from
Applied Biosystems.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer
containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase
inhibitors. Equal amounts of total proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and subjected to Western blot analysis using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Goat polyclonal anti–
phospho-paxillin (Tyr31), rabbit anti–platelet/endothelial cell adhesion
molecule-1 (PECAM-1; or CD31), rabbit anti–intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1; or CD54), mouse anti-h-catenin, mouse anti–
phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and rabbit polyclonal
anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibodies were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal anti–
phospho-p130Cas (Tyr410) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Rabbit anti-KSHV GPCR polyclonal antibody was purchased from Cell
Sciences, Inc.
Confocal scanning. Cells were cultured in eight-well chamber slides
(to f40–60% confluence), then serum starved, and treated as indicated.
After stimulation, cells were immediately fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and permeabilized for 2 min on ice.
Cells were first incubated with primary antibodies or normal IgG controls
for at least 1 h at 4jC and then softly washed three times with 1 PBS. Next,
FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 30 min at 4jC. After
discarding the staining solution with secondary antibody, propidium iodide
staining solution (10 Ag/mL) was added for 5 min at room temperature.

Cells were carefully washed again three times with 1 PBS. Finally, the
chambers were removed and coverslips were mounted on slides and
examined under a Leica TCS-NT laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems). Antibodies used were goat anti–phospho-paxillin antibody
(Tyr31), rabbit anti-KSHV GPCR polyclonal antibody, and fluorescein
antigoat and antirabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories). Propidium iodide solution was from Sigma-Aldrich.
Adhesion assay. HMVEC and GFP-BCBL-1 cells were pretreated with
different concentrations of D9-THC or vehicle control as indicated. GFPBCBL-1 cells were then cocultured with HMVEC for 30 min on a shaker at
mild speed (50 rpm) in 96-well plates. GFP-BCBL-1 cells were next removed
and carefully washed three times with 1 PBS. The adhesion of GFP-BCBL1 cells to HMVEC was determined by using a Victor 1420 MultiLabel
counter from Perkin-Elmer Co. The adhesion index was calculated and
shown.

Transformation assay. HMVEC were exposed to KSHV or mock
controls and cultured in the presence of D9-THC or vehicle control along
with different antagonists in soft agar medium for 21 days, following the
protocol provided by Chemicon International, Inc. Colonies were then
stained and counted under a microscope.
Transfection and proliferation assay. HMVEC were transiently transfected with plasmids containing wild-type KSHV GPCR (pcDNA3vGPCR) or
vector alone (pcDNA3) by using Superfect transfection reagent from Qiagen.
At day 2 after transfection, a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide proliferation assay was done in the presence or absence of
D9-THC by using the Cell Proliferation kit (I) from Roche Applied Science,
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis. Each treatment was done at least in triplicate and
repeated three times. Statistical significance was determined by using the
ANOVA test (P < 0.05).

Results
Low doses of #9-THC increase KSHV infection. We first
observed robust expression of the cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and
CB2, in HMVEC (Fig. 1A). Next, to investigate whether D9-THC
affects KSHV infection, HMVEC were treated with different doses
of D9-THC (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 Amol/L) or vehicle control for
1 h before exposure to GFP-KSHV. Low doses of D9-THC (<1 Amol/L)
increased KSHV infection in a concentration-dependent manner
compared with the vehicle treatment (Fig. 1B and C). High doses of
D9-THC (>1 Amol/L) caused considerable cell death in combination
with KSHV exposure (data not shown). In addition, we found that

www.aacrjournals.org

KSHV infection of endothelial cells slightly up-regulated the
expression of CB1 and CB2 (data not shown). However, we did
not observe any significant changes in the expression of integrin
a3h1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR)3, or DC-SIGN on treatment with D9-THC (data not shown).
We next sought to determine whether D9-THC may modulate
KSHV entry into endothelial cells. KSHV mainly enters target cells
through endocytosis, which is controlled by reorganization and
rearrangement of the cytoskeleton (21, 24). To this end, we studied
the effects of D9-THC on the cytoskeletal system. By using Western
blot analysis, we found that two important cytoskeletal proteins,
p130Cas and paxillin, were significantly phosphorylated after
exposure to D9-THC (Fig. 2A). To further confirm the above
observations, we did confocal scanning to detect activated paxillin
under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 2B, activated paxillin
exhibited staining with fluorescein. The basal level of activated
paxillin was observed to be uniform in the endothelial cytoplasm in
quiescent cells. After D9-THC stimulation, significantly more
paxillin was activated and aggregated beneath the cell surface.
Cell membranes seemed invaginated and some pseudopodia-like
dendrites were formed. These morphologic changes in cell shape
can increase the interaction of cells with viruses, enhance
endocytosis, and could also account for the observed increase in
KSHV infection. In this regard, a specific endocytosis inhibitor,
cytochalasin D, was used to block the activation of the cytoskeletal
system induced by D9-THC. Pretreatment with cytochalasin D
(1 Amol/L; Sigma-Aldrich) significantly decreased KSHV infection
in the presence of D9-THC (Fig. 2C), suggesting that D9-THC
modulates the process of endocytosis and leads to higher KSHV
infection efficiency in HMVEC.
Low doses of #9-THC induce KSHV replication in endothelial cells. The status of the KSHV life cycle is closely linked to the
course of KSHV-associated diseases. The major latency-associated
nuclear antigen of KSHV (LANA-1, ORF73) is expressed by infected
cells and has been commonly used as a marker of KSHV load in
real-time PCR assays (23). Chemical agents like 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induce KSHV and have been used as
a positive control to study cannabinoid effects on viral latency. We
found a significant increase in the number of LANA-1 copies in
KSHV-infected HMVEC on treatment with D9-THC but not in the
culture supernatants (Fig. 3A and C). Viral loads were observed to
increase over time within a week after exposure to D9-THC (data
not shown). Basal titers of KSHV in the HMVEC were much lower
than those in the GFP-BCBL-1 cells. However, the effect of D9-THC
on viral titers was more significant in the KSHV-HMVEC than in
the GFP-BCBL-1 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that
the KSHV life cycle is cell dependent and is differentially
modulated in response to certain stimuli like cannabinoids.
We then assessed the expression of ORF50, the major switch
gene for KSHV from latency to the lytic cycle, after treatment of
endothelial cells with D9-THC. We observed that ORF50 expression
was up-regulated by D9-THC in KSHV-infected HMVEC (Fig. 3B).
These results indicate that D9-THC–induced ORF50 expression can
promote KSHV lytic replication in HMVEC.
Low doses of #9-THC foster KSHV-infected HMVEC to form
colonies in vitro. D9-THC has been reported to enhance tumor
cell proliferation and to accelerate cancer progression (25–27).
We found a biphasic activity of D9-THC on KSHV-mediated transformation. Low doses of D9-THC stimulated colony formation,
whereas high doses of D9-THC inhibited colony formation (Fig. 4A).
To decipher how D9-THC may change the growth status of tumor

cells, we investigated the expression levels of KSHV GPCR, one of
the key elements in KSHV-mediated cell transformation. We
observed a pattern of KSHV GPCR distribution on the cell surface
similar to that of normal GPCRs. Isolated KSHV GPCR pits or
vesicles were observed on the cell membrane in KSHV-infected
HMVEC in the absence of cannabinoid treatment. However,
significantly more and brighter KSHV GPCR vesicles aggregated
on the cell surface of spindle-shaped cells after exposure to D9-THC
(Fig. 4B). The increased expression of KSHV GPCR was further

confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). These results suggest the
involvement of KSHV GPCR in the transforming effects of D9-THC.
To show whether KSHV GPCR is integrally involved in D9-THC–
induced cell proliferation, we transiently transfected HMVEC with
plasmids encoding either KSHV GPCR or vector alone and then
quantitated and compared the effect of D9-THC on cell proliferation. We found a significant increase in cell proliferation following
D9-THC treatment of the KSHV GPCR-expressing cells but no such
effect with the control cells (Fig. 4D). In addition, we observed no
significant changes in growth-regulated oncogene-a or interleukin8 (IL-8) production in the cultured KSHV-infected HMVEC (data
not shown). These two growth factors have been reported to
stimulate Kaposi’s sarcoma growth through binding to their
cognate receptors and KSHV GPCR. These data indicate that

Effect of Cannabinoids on KSHV

neither autocrine nor paracrine loops contribute to the effects of
D9-THC, but rather that up-regulation of the constitutively active
KSHV GPCR mediates the effects of D9-THC on Kaposi’s sarcoma
cell proliferation.
Low doses of #9-THC induce the adhesion of KSHV-infected
B cells to endothelial cells. Latent-infected lymphocytes constitute the major pathologic reservoir of KSHV in vivo. When KSHV
latency switches into lytic replication in B cells and lytically
infected lymphocytes circulate or home to adjacent lymph nodes,
interactions between lymphocytes and endothelial cells frequently
occur, which may enhance viral secondary transmission. To
address whether D9-THC could modulate viral transmission, we
used an in vitro static adhesion assay to investigate the effects of
D9-THC on the interaction between lymphocytes and endothelial
cells. Lytically infected GFP-BCBL-1 cells were prepared by using
TPA (20 ng/mL) and then coincubated with HMVEC. Both GFPBCBL-1 cells and HMVEC were treated in the absence or presence
of D9-THC, as indicated. We found that D9-THC significantly
enhanced the adhesion of GFP-BCBL-1 cells to HMVEC (Fig. 5A),
leading to increased KSHV infection in HMVEC compared with the
vehicle control (data not shown). Further experiments showed that
the D9-THC–induced adhesion was due to up-regulated PECAM-1
expression (Fig. 5B), as neutralized anti-PECAM-1 antibody
blocked the D9-THC–induced effects (Fig. 5C). These data suggest
that D9-THC stimulates expression of the endothelial-specific focal
adhesion molecule PECAM-1, resulting in enhanced cell-cell
interactions.
Different cannabinoid receptors are involved in #9-THC–
mediated signal transduction. To investigate which cannabinoid
receptors might play an important role in the D9-THC–induced
effects, we blocked cannabinoid receptors with specific antagonists
of the receptors. We observed that D9-THC induced significant
expression of PECAM-1 and h-catenin but not ICAM-1 in KSHVinfected HMVEC. Specific antagonists, including AM251, AM630,
and O-1918, only partially blocked these effects (Fig. 6). Our results
suggest that different cannabinoid receptors are involved in D9THC–mediated signal transduction.

sarcoma could assist in its prevention (28). Based on epidemiologic
studies, drug addiction increases the risk of acquiring infectious
diseases (15). In addition, marijuana use is common in U.S. and
European populations, and medicinal treatment with cannabinoids
is increasing. Thus, in this report, we address the role of
cannabinoids in the pathogenesis of Kaposi’s sarcoma. Our studies
strongly suggest that D9-THC could worsen KSHV infection and
foster development of the neoplasm.
We found that D9-THC modulated host-virus interactions via
its effects on endocytosis. We also observed that low doses of D9THC (<1 Amol/L) activated the cytoskeletal system in HMVEC,
with significant phosphorylation of p130Cas and paxillin, two
critical components of the focal adhesion complex. These
proteins are required for the control of actin organization and
the formation of microvilli-like cellular protrusions and for the
internalization of bacteria as well as the migratory responses of
cells (29–31). In particular, p130Cas protein has been reported to
participate in the uptake of adenovirus, human respiratory
syncytial virus, and Yersinia through either endocytosis or
phagocytosis (32–34). Furthermore, both p130Cas and paxillin
proteins interact with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and are
tyrosine phosphorylated during integrin-mediated adhesion.
Integrins and FAK are involved in KSHV entry into target cells
(21, 35). Our findings indicate that cannabinoids like D9-THC may
facilitate KSHV infection through activation of certain cytoskeletal proteins.
We further showed that D9-THC modified KSHV status through
regulation of the key viral gene ORF50. Maintenance of latent
status and reactivation of lytic replication are essential for Kaposi’s
sarcoma occurrence. The latent infection contributes to immune
evasion, whereas lytic infection leads to the production of
infectious viral progeny. KSHV latency usually dominates the
KSHV life cycle, and KSHV starts its lytic cycle through unclear
mechanisms. Because ORF50 expression is sufficient for KSHV
lytic viral reactivation and ORF50 targeting efficiently inhibits
KSHV replication, it has been recognized as a major switch gene
for KSHV reactivation (36, 37). In prior studies, TPA and hypoxia
were found to stimulate the lytic replication of KSHV via ORF50,
and methotrexate was shown to inhibit TPA-mediated lytic
replication also through ORF50 (38–40). Therefore, D9-THC–
induced ORF50 gene expression and subsequent KSHV lytic
replication may significantly change the course of KSHVassociated diseases.
Moreover, we showed that D9-THC strongly induced the
expression of KSHV GPCR on the cell surface and significantly
fostered endothelial transformation in vitro. Kaposi’s sarcoma is a
typical vascular tumor expressing high levels of VEGF and VEGFR.
D9-THC has been reported to inhibit the angiogenesis and
tumorigenesis of gliomas via the VEGF/VEGFR pathway (41).
However, this does not seem to be the case in Kaposi’s sarcoma
because the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of D9-THC on
VEGF/VEGFR were only observed in HMVEC and not in KSHVinfected HMVEC and Kaposi’s sarcoma cells (data not shown). In
contrast, we found that D9-THC induced the expression of KSHV
GPCR, a homologue of the IL-8 receptor. It has been reported that
constitutively active KSHV GPCR triggers the autonomous
proliferation of endothelial cells, causes Kaposi’s sarcoma-like
lesions in mice, and initiates the development and progression of
Kaposi’s sarcoma (42–45). The differing effects of D9-THC on
KSHV observed in our study and other reports may be due to the
varied transcriptional activation of KSHV genes in different cell

types (endothelial cells versus B cells) after infection. In addition,
different concentration ranges of D9-THC (low versus high dosage)
as well as varied technological approaches were used in our study
as compared with the previous report. Hence, it seems that
distinct pathogenetic pathways may exist for KSHV-associated
neoplasms.
Cannabinoids are a family of multifunctional compounds and
their targets are not fully understood. It is known that D9-THC
binds to the CB1 and CB2 receptors with equal affinity. However,
D9-THC may also bind to other unknown receptors because
vanilloid receptor 1 and GPCR55 also serve as cannabinoid
receptors (46, 47). Here, we found that both CB1 and CB2 receptors
as well as an endothelial cannabinoid receptor distinct from CB1
and CB2 (20) may be involved in the D9-THC–mediated effects on
KSHV because selective antagonists for each of these receptors
only partially blocked the D9-THC–induced effects. Further
investigation is needed to clarify the multifunctional effects of
cannabinoids.
In conclusion, our study indicates that D9-THC in concentrations
easily achieved in vivo may enhance KSHV infection, accelerate
KSHV replication, and/or foster KSHV-mediated transformation.
These observations suggest that D9-THC may accelerate the
development, progression, and spread of Kaposi’s sarcoma. It is

important to emphasize that marijuana is not a single drug but a
complex botanical substance. Although D9-THC is the major
psychoactive component of marijuana, many of its other
components are not well elucidated. The clinical pharmacology
of the constituents of marijuana is likely complicated, particularly
when the plant is smoked or eaten in its natural form. Indeed, both
viral enhancers and inhibitors may coexist within marijuana.
Hence, for the medical use of purified cannabinoids like D9-THC,
our study suggests that their administration may place patients at
greater risk for KSHV infection and Kaposi’s sarcoma and that
treatment should be evaluated on a case by case basis under close
medical supervision. Further epidemiologic studies and clinical
research are needed to clarify the importance and safety of
administering cannabinoids like D9-THC.
