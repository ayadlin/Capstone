ABSTRACT
Our previous studies showed that MYB is required for proliferation of, and confers
protection against apoptosis on, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+ve) breast cancer cells,
which are almost invariably also MYB+ve. We have also shown that MYB expression
in ER+ve breast cancer cells is regulated at the level of transcriptional elongation and
as such, is suppressed by CDK9i. Here we examined the effects of CDK9i on breast
cancer cells and the involvement of MYB in these effects. ER+ve breast cancer cell lines
including MCF-7 were much more sensitive (> 10 times) to killing by CDK9i than ERve
/MYB-ve cells. Moreover, surviving cells showed a block at the G2/M phase of the
cell cycle. Importantly, ectopic MYB expression conferred resistance to apoptosis
induction, cell killing and G2/M accumulation. Expression of relevant MYB target
genes including BCL2 and CCNB1 was suppressed by CDK9 inhibition, and this too was
reversed by ectopic MYB expression. Nevertheless, inhibition of BCL2 alone either by
MYB knockdown or by ABT-199 treatment was insufficient for significant induction
of apoptosis. Further studies implied that suppression of MCL-1, a well-documented
target of CDK9 inhibition, was additionally required for apoptosis induction, while
maximal levels of apoptosis induced by CDK9i are likely to also involve inhibition of
BCL2L1 expression. Taken together these data suggest that MYB regulation of BCL2
underlies the heightened sensitivity of ER+ve compared to ER-ve breast cancer cells to
CDK9 inhibition, and that these compounds represent a potential therapeutic for ER+ve
breast cancers and possibly other MYB-dependent cancers.

INTRODUCTION

transition [5, 6] . Importantly we also demonstrated
that MYB is required for mammary tumour formation
and/or progression in mouse models, and is frequently
upregulated in metastases [7, 8].
The anti-apoptotic role of MYB in breast cancer
was not immediately apparent since shRNA-mediated
knockdown did not induce significant apoptosis by
itself. However, MYB knockdown greatly enhanced
the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to several chemical
agents, an effect mediated (at least in part) by the MYB
target gene BCL2, since knockdown of the latter mimicked
the sensitisation effects of MYB knockdown [5].
Given these findings we have proposed that MYB

MYB encodes a transcription factor that plays key
roles in normal function and cancers of the hematopoietic
system, mammary and colonic epithelium and certain
other tissues [1], [2]. It has been known for some time
that MYB is highly expressed in estrogen receptor-positive
(ER+ve) breast cancer [3], which reflects the fact that MYB
is a direct target of estrogen/ER signaling (ER). More
recently our laboratories have shown that MYB is required
for the proliferation of breast cancer cells [4], contributes
to suppression of apoptosis and differentiation, and is
involved in the modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal

may be a valuable and broadly-applicable therapeutic
target in breast cancer [9]. As a transcription factor,
though, MYB itself is not currently considered to be
readily “druggable” . However, our work on the regulation
of MYB expression in breast cancer has suggested an
alternate approach to suppress MYB activity. Specifically
it has become apparent that MYB expression is frequently
regulated by a transcriptional elongation block imposed
by a motif in the first intron comprised of a stem-loopforming sequence followed by a poly(dT) tract (SL-dT)
[10]. We have further shown that in ER+ve breast cancer
cells, this block is overcome by estrogen-stimulated
ER binding in the vicinity of the SL-dT region [11]
and direct ER-mediated recruitment of the elongationpromoting P-TEFb complex [12]. P-TEFb functions by
phosphorylation, through its kinase component CDK9,
of substrates including specific serine residues (Ser2) in
the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. A number
of CDK9 inhibitors (CDK9i) are available and in breast
cancer cells, such inhibitors can re-impose the block
to MYB transcriptional elongation and suppress MYB
expression [12] .
While there have been several studies on the effects
of CDK9i on breast cancer cells [13-15], relatively few
relevant targets, other than MCL-1, have been widely
reported. Here we have examined, in the present report,
the potential of CDK9i to suppress the proliferation and/or
viability of ER+ve breast cancer cells through the inhibition
of MYB expression. We show that CDK9i can induce
apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of ER+ve/MYB+ve breast
cancer cells, while MYB-ve breast cancer cells are much
less sensitive to these compounds. Furthermore ectopic
MYB expression can protect ER+ve breast cancer cells
against CDK9i, suggesting that the effects of the latter
are at least partly due to MYB down-regulation. However,
mechanism of apoptosis induction by CDK9i is more
complex, appearing to involve direct inhibition of MCL1
expression as well as suppression, through decreased MYB
expression, of BCL2 levels.

other CDKs [21]. MCF-7 cells were treated with these
compounds, along with Flavopiridol, for 4h, following
which we determined the expression of mature MYB
mRNA. It is clear from Figure 1B that expression of
MYB is downregulated by all these drugs. Full doseresponse studies of each drug (See Supplementary Figure
S1A-E), and confirmation of inhibition of RNA Pol II Ser2
phosphorylation by AT7519 are shown in Supplementary
Figure S1.
Next we examined the correlation of drug-mediated
downregulation of MYB with respect to transcriptional
pausing. For this purpose we used our previouslydescribed [12] primer pairs Pre-I, Pre-II, Post-III and
Post-IV (Figure 1A) to detect transcription before or
after the SL-dT region. As seen in Figure 1C, the ratios
of post- to pre- transcripts were at least two fold lower
with each CDK9i compared to untreated controls. Thus,
Flavopiridol, AT7519 and BE-09-LN53 all inhibit MYB
expression by suppressing transcriptional elongation.
This transcriptional inhibition by CDK9i also reflected
in dose dependent downregulation of MYB expression
when extracts of MCF-7 cells, treated with AT7519 or
Flavopiridol at different dosages, western blotted with anti
MYB antibody (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B).

ER+veMYB+ve cell lines are more sensitive than
ER-Ve MYB-Ve cells to CDK9 inhibitors-induced
apoptosis
Since we previously showed that MYB expression
is essential for proliferation and contributes to survival
of ER+veMYB+ve breast cancer cells [4], we wanted to
investigate the effect of CDK9i on the proliferation and
viability of a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Therefore,
MCF-7, T47D and ZR-75 cells were incubated with
increasing doses of Flavopiridol for 72h. To examine
potential correlation of any effects observed with MYB
expression, we also used a panel of ER-veMYB-ve cell
lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and BT-10). It is
clear that Flavopiridol has a dose-dependent effect on
numbers of viable ER+veMYB+ve cells, with IC50 values of
40-50nM for each line (left panels of Figure 2A and 2B).
In contrast, all 3 ER-veMYB-ve lines were quite resistant
with IC50 values ≥ 1000nM. This selective sensitivity of
ER+veMYB+ve cell lines to CDK9i was further confirmed
using AT7519 (Figure 2B), for which the IC50 for MCF-7
was ~50nM while for MDA-MB-231 it was > 400nM. In
agreement with our observations, values of 40nM and 340
nM were reported by Squires et al. [19]for MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-468, respectively.
We next wished to determine whether the effect of
CDK9i on cell viability of ER+veMYB+ve breast cancer cells
was associated with apoptosis and cell death. Therefore,
MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with either
AT7519 or Flavopiridol for 48h. Cells were harvested and

RESULTS
CDK9i selectively downregulate MYB expression
by imposing transcriptional pausing
We tested a number of recently developed CDKi
and compared these with Flavopiridol for their ability
to suppress MYB expression and impose an elongation
block at the MYB SL-dT region. These compounds
included AT7519, which is a multi-CDK inhibitor with
a very low IC50 (<10nM) for CDK9, and is currently in
phase-II clinical trials for several cancers [17-20]. We
also used a new inhibitor, BE-09-LN53, which has a
substantially greater specificity for CDK9 compared to

and late apoptotic (AnnexinV and PI double-positive) cells
(Figure 2C). In the presence of either drug, almost tenfold more late apoptotic MCF-7 cells accumulated than
was seen with MDA-MB-231. Microscopic examination
of drug-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells at
selected concentrations (Figure 2D) also clearly showed
corresponding effects of these CDK9i on cell morphology
and cell number. That these effects were largely due to
CDK9 inhibition is reinforced by the observation that the
MCF-7 cells were also much more sensitive to the highly
selective CDK9 inhibitor BE-09-LN53 than were MDAMB-431 cells (Supplementary Figure S3).

(Figure 3C), which is also clear from the cell morphology
where the normal flat epithelial shape of MCF-7-Cont
cells changed to the shrunken, spherical appearance of
apoptotic cells (Figure 3D, upper panels). Therefore,
we conclude that maintenance of MYB expression can
overcome the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to CDK9i, which
is in turn consistent with MYB down-regulation being
a primary mediator of ER+veMYB+ve breast cancer cell
killing by this class of drugs.
We previously showed that the anti-apoptotic
protein BCL2 is a direct MYB target gene in MCF7 cells [11]. Thus it is possible that CDK9i-induced
apoptosis may be mediated by the down-regulation of
this gene. We therefore examined expression of BCL2 in
MCF-7-Cont cells and MCF-7-Myb cells following 4h
treatment with AT7519. As shown in Figures 3E and 3F,
drug treatment resulted in dose-dependent suppression
of BCL2 mRNA and protein in MCF-7-Cont cells, .In
contrast, no significant decrease was observed in the
level of either protein or mRNA in MCF-7-Myb cells.
These data strongly support the hypothesis that BCL2
down-regulation resulting from inhibition of MYB
transcription contributes to the apoptotic effect of CDK9i
on ER+veMYB+ve breast cancer cells.

Ectopic expression of MYB is sufficient to suppress
CDK9 inhibitor-mediated induction of apoptosis
The selective effect of both drugs on ER+veMYB+ve,
compared to ER-veMYB-ve cells at relatively low
concentrations implies they are acting on specific target
genes or pathways in the former to induce apoptosis.
Our published data and those in Figure 1 showed that
transcription of MYB in ER+veMYB+ve breast cancer cells
is regulated by the P-TEFb complex and suppressed
by CDK9i [12]. This suggests that MYB inhibition is a
potential mediator of the effects these drugs, particularly
given that MYB directly regulates the anti-apoptotic gene
BCL2 [11].
To address this, we used lentiviral vectors to
establish a stable MCF-7 cell line expressing MYB (MCF7-Myb), and control cell line with the corresponding
empty pLV411vector (MCF-7-Cont). Both cell lines were
treated with varying doses of AT7519 for 4h and then MYB
levels were measured by q-PCR. Figure 3A shows that,
as expected, MYB levels decreased in the control cells
but were maintained in the MCF-7-Myb cells, because
transcription from the lentiviral EF1A promoter is not
primarily regulated by transcriptional elongation. Note
also that the MYB level in the MCF-7-Myb line was less
than twice the endogenous level in untreated control
cells, i.e. MYB was not expressed at supra-physiological
levels. Moreover, the AT7519 doses used did not adversely
affect the cell’s transcription machinery overall, since
expression of PPIA (Cyclophilin A) was unperturbed.
Similar results were obtained with Flavopiridol treatment
(data not shown). Next, the two cell lines were treated
with Flavopiridol for 72h and viable cells assessed by
Resazaurin assay. As shown in Figure 3B, the control
MCF-7 cells responded similarly to the parental cell line
with a dose-dependent decrease in viable cells. However,
a dramatic difference was observed with the MCF-7-Myb
line, where Flavopiridol treatment remained ineffective up
to 1000nM. Similarly, AnnexinV and PI staining showed
that, as observed above, both drugs effectively induced
apoptosis in control cells but not MCF-7-Myb cells

CDK9i induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and downregulate MYB target genes CCNB1 and CCNE1
In addition to the apoptotic effects described above,
it seemed possible that the decrease in viable cell numbers
in ER+veMYB+ve breast cancer cells treated with CDK9i
may also reflect direct inhibition of proliferation; this
would be at least consistent with visual inspection (e.g.
Figure 2D). We therefore analysed cell cycle progression
in treated MCF-7-Cont, MCF-7-Myb and ER-veMYBve
MDA-MB-231 cells with 200nM AT7519 for 48h
(Figure 4A). As seen above, CDK9i treatment induced
a significant amount of cell death, indicated here by
increased sub-G1 DNA content, in control MCF-7
cells, but not in MCF-7-Myb or MDA-MB-231 cells. In
addition, an approximately two-fold increase was also
observed in the G2/M population in drug-treated MCF-7Cont cells compared to untreated cells. At the same time,
we observed a decreased number of cells in S phase. In
contrast, little or no increase in G2/M cells was seen in
either MCF-7-Myb or MDA-MB-231 cells.
These observations suggested MYB suppression
by CDK9 inhibition was indeed affecting cell cycle
progression both at the G1/S transition, as previously
reported [22] and during the G2/M phases. MYB has been
reported to directly activate the expression of CCNE1
(in normal and transformed colonic epithelium [23]
and CCNB1 (in leukaemia and breast cancer cells; [24,
25]. We therefore examined expression of these genes
and of CCND1, which is not a known MYB target, in

MCF-7-Myb and control cell lines treated with AT7519.
Expression of CCNB1 and CCNE1 was down-regulated
with increasing doses of AT7519 in the control cell line
but not in MCF-7-Myb cells, which is consistent with
the regulation of these genes by MYB (Figure 4B).
Surprisingly, the level of CCND1 showed a similar
pattern albeit to a lesser degree; it is conceivable that the
increased level of CCND1 in MCF-7-Myb cells reflects an
indirect effect mediated by MYB’s ability to enhance ER
expression [26, 27]

To obtain further support for the proposition that
inhibition of MYB expression enhanced apoptosis through
downregulation of BCL2, we employed a stable cell line
generated by transducing MCF-7 cells with a lentivirus
carrying a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible MYB shRNA (C5)
similar to that described previously [4], and a control cell
line which carries shRNA targeting the firefly luciferase
gene (Luc shRNA). As shown in Figure 6A, there was
some leakiness in the MYB shRNA line, but nevertheless
Dox induction reduced the level of MYB by more than
90% compared to parental or Luc shRNA MCF-7 cells.
This was associated with a substantial reduction in the
level of BCL-2. However, MYB down-regulation had no
effect on the expression of MCL-1 (Figure 6A), consistent
with the fact that MCL-1 is not a known MYB target gene.
We then asked whether the effect of MYB knockdown
combined with MCL-1 siRNA treatment result in a similar
enhancement of apoptosis to that seen with combined
BCL-2 and MCL-1 inhibition. Thus MCF-7 C5 cells
were treated with or without Dox for 3 days, and then
transfected with MCL-1 siRNA. It is clear from Figure 6C
that the combined effect on apoptosis of MCL-1 and MYB
knockdown was substantially greater than that of either
alone, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of both
could mediate CDK9i-induced apoptosis.
However even this level of apoptosis was
consistently less than that seen with CDK9i (e.g. Figures
2C and 3C), suggesting that CDK9 inhibition may directly
affect other apoptotic regulators independently of MYB. To
examine this possibility we measured the level of BCL2L1
(BCL-xL), BCL2L2 (BCL-W) and MCL1 mRNA following
AT7519 or BE-09-LN53 treatment. Figure 6D shows that
BCL2L1 expression (in addition to that of BCL2 and
MCL1, as expected) was suppressed; however this was
unlikely to be mediated by suppression of MYB because
shRNA-mediated MYB knockdown did not affect BCL2L1
expression (Supplementary Figure S4). Our observation
is in agreement with reports of CDK9i suppressing
BCL2L1 expression in breast cancer cells (e.g. ref. [13]).
Finally, we examined apoptosis induction by combined
knockdown of MCL1 and inhibition of both BCL-xL and
BCL-2, using ABT-737 [32] (Figure 6E). ABT-737 alone,
like ABT-199, increased apoptosis to ~ 15% (5% above
the untreated control), while as also seen in Figure 6B
above, ABT-199 plus MCL-1siRNA increased this to ~
35%. However, MCL-1 siRNA combined with ABT-737
resulted in a similar degree of apoptosis - about 55% - to
that seen with the CDK9i. These data are consistent with
the notion that apoptosis induction by CDK9i involves
combined inhibition of MCL-1, BCL-2 and BCL-xL. Note
that the overall effectiveness of CDK9i in killing ER+ve/
MYB+ve breast cancer cells is unlikely to be limited to 50%
because (a) longer treatment increases the proportion of
dead cells measured, and (b) the FACS-based assays used
here are likely to underestimate the true proportion of dead
cells (data not shown).

Role of MCL1 in CDK9 inhibitor-induced killing
of ER+ve MYB+ve breast cancer cells
The data presented above all imply that MYB downregulation, most likely acting through its target BCL2,
is an essential contributor to apoptosis in MCF-7 cells
by CDK9i such as Flavopiridol and AT7519. However,
MYB suppression alone does not appear to be sufficient
to induce a significant degree of apoptosis, as shown by
our previous shRNA studies [4]. Given several studies
showing an important role for MCL1 in the resistance of
breast cancer cells to apoptosis [13], and other reports
that MCL1 expression is suppressed at the level of
transcriptional elongation by CDK9i in a range of cell
types [28, 29], we decided to explore its role in the present
system. We first confirmed that AT7519 induced rapid
down-regulation of MCL1 mRNA (Figures 5A and 5B),
and then used siRNA to suppress its expression in MCF7 cells (Figure 5C). However, even the most effective of
the 4 siRNAs tested (siRNA-IV) induced only a small
increase in the number of apoptotic (Annexin V-positive)
cells (Figure 5D).
We then considered that MCL-1 might be required,
even though not sufficient, to protect MCF-7 cells from
apoptosis, since we found that CDK9 inhibitor treatment
simultaneously inhibited expression of two major antiapoptotic proteins, BCL-2 and MCL-1 (Figures 3 and
5). To explore this possibility, we treated MCF-7 cells
with the specific BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 [30], MCL1 siRNA-IV or both. Treatment with either ABT-199
or MCL-1 siRNA alone induced only a small increase
in the number of apoptotic cells above control levels,
while a substantially larger increase was observed when
cells were treated with ABT-199 and MCL-1 siRNAIV in combination (Figure 6B). These observations are
somewhat in accord with those reported in [31], although
we note that these authors used the ABT-737 compound
which inhibits BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-W (see also
below). Nevertheless, the combined effect of BCL-2 and
MCL-1 inhibition on the proportion of Annexin V-positive
cells was consistently less than that seen with CDK9i (e.g.
Figures 2C and 3C). We therefore wished to determine
whether CDK9i had pro-apoptotic effects beyond those
mediated by combined MCL-1 and MYB downregulation.

inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators such as
tamoxifen, and antagonists such as fulvestrant. However,
resistance to endocrine therapy is common, with recent
studies indicating almost 30% of patients receiving
primary therapy either fail to respond or more commonly,
develop secondary resistance [33]. Thus there is a pressing
need for new therapies for this class of ER+ve breast
cancers.

Among the four major subtypes of breast cancer
Luminal A, Luminal B (both ER+ve), HER2 positive, and
triple negative/basal-like, the first two comprise more than
70% of breast cancer cases. ER+ve breast cancers have
the most favourable prognosis among the 4 groups and
typically respond to endocrine therapies such as aromatase

effectors of estrogen/ER signalling in breast cancer. As
detailed in the Introduction, MYB is one such effector [5,

which ER regulates MYB expression [12] have highlighted
the possibility of targeting MYB with CDK9i. Here, we
have explored this possibility and found that CDK9i
down-regulate MYB expression and selectively induce
apoptosis in ER+ve/MYB+ve but not ER-ve/MYB-ve breast
cancer cells. In surviving cells, CDK9is’ also induce a
block at the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Moreover,
ectopic expression of MYB was sufficient to suppress
CDK9 inhibitor-mediated apoptosis, strongly supporting
the notion that MYB is a critical target of these inhibitors
in ER+ve breast cancer cells. We have also investigated
the mechanisms by which CDK9i induce apoptosis and
suppress cell cycle progression.
Our published work [12] showed that the CDK9
inhibitor DRB and Flavopiridol inhibit MYB expression
by suppressing transcriptional elongation at the SLdT pausing region in intron 1. In the present study we
used additional CDK9i AT7519 [19] and BE-09-LN53
[21], and confirmed that these have similar effects
on MYB transcription, and also selectively induce
apoptosis in ER+ve/MYB+ve breast cancer cells. This is
significant because the latter compound shows a much
better selectivity for CDK9 over other CDKs than do
Flavopiridol and AT7519. For example, Flavopiridol
inhibits CDK1, 2, 4, 5, 6, with IC50s of ~40nM and CDK9
with IC50 ~3nM, while BE-09-LN53 has IC50s for the
former CDKs of >200nM and an IC50 of <0.4nM for
CDK9 [21]. Thus the use of these compounds collectively
indicates that effects on MYB transcription and cell killing
are indeed due to targeting CDK9.
Nevertheless, the fact that CDK9 inhibition
selectively induces apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest
in ER+ve/MYB+ve breast cancer cells does not in itself
show that MYB is a relevant target of these compounds;
indeed expression of a substantial fraction of the genome
is regulated by transcriptional pausing [35]. We have
addressed this in part by showing that ectopic MYB
expression can overcome the heightened sensitivity of
in ER+ve/MYB+ve breast cancer cells (compared to MYBve
cells) to CDK9i. It is noteworthy that the level of
ectopic expression in our study was similar to that of the
endogenous gene - the key difference is that expression of
virally-encoded MYB is insensitive to CDK9 inhibition.
Importantly we showed that CDK9i downregulate known
MYB target genes with roles in suppression of apoptosis
(BCL2) and cell cycle progression (CCNB1 and CCNE1),
and that this downregulation is also prevented by ectopic
MYB expression. It remains to be explained, though,
why we saw G2/M but not G1 arrest following CDK9
inhibitor treatment of MCF-7 cells, in view of the strong
suppression of CCNE1 (encoding the G1/S cyclin E) and
the fact that MYB knockdown by shRNA resulted in G1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

arrest but not a discernible G2/M block (Drabsch 2007).
It is possible that the G2/M effect reflects the combination
of Cyclin B downregulation and the ability of AT7519 to
inhibit CDK1 [20], which is also required for progression
through mitosis. The reported IC50 for CDK1 is 210nM
[20], so at least partial inhibition could have occured in the
experiment shown in Figure 4.
It also became clear that the extensive induction
of apoptosis by CDK9i we saw here was unlikely to be
due to inhibition of MYB and BCL2 expression alone. As
we reported earlier [5] and confirmed here, we observed
little or no apoptosis following shRNA-mediated MYB
knockdown or treating cells with the BCL-2 inhibitor
ABT-199. While it is well known (and reconfirmed here)
that CDK9i downregulate MCL-1 expression [36] [14], we
did not observe significant cell killing by siRNA-mediated
downregulation of MCL-1 alone. However increased
killing of MCF-7 cells was seen when MCL-1 knockdown
and BCL-2 inhibition (using ABT-199) were combined,
implying that inhibition of both MCL-1 and BCL-2 is
required to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, and indeed
a similar level of apoptosis was seen when both MYB and
MCL-1 were knocked down.
Nevertheless, the level of apoptosis seen with these
combined treatments was consistently less than that
seen with CDK9i, suggesting that CDK9 inhibition has
additional pro-apoptotic effects. This notion is supported
by our observation that CDK9 inhibition, but not MYB
knockdown, reduces the level of BCL2L1 expression, and
that MCL-1 knockdown combined with inhibition of both
BCL2 and BCL2L1 by ABT-737 increased the level of
apoptosis to a level similar to that obtained induced by
CDK9i. In any case, our observations strongly support
the proposition that apoptosis induction and killing
of ER+veMYB+ve by CDK9i, as well as cell inhibition
of cycle progression, is due to the combined direct
inhibition of MYB, MCL-1 and BCL-xL expression. These
notions are illustrated in the model shown in Figure 6F
and importantly provide an explanation for the relative
insensitivity of ER-ve/MYB-ve breast cancer cells to CDK9i.
Recently, Xiao et al [37] also reported that apoptosis
of a series of breast cancer cell lines was enhanced by
combined chemical inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members MCL-1, BCL-xL and BCL-2. Their
results are broadly in agreement with ours as they used
Navitoclax, a pharmacologically-optimised derivative
of ABT-737 [38, 39], to inhibit BCL-2 and BCL-xL
simultaneously and showed that this synergised with
MCL-1 inhibition, although they did observe a somewhat
greater loss of viability of MCF-7 cells following MCL-1
inhibition alone than we did here. Interestingly though,
and in agreement with what would be predicted from our
observations, they did not observe a significant synergistic
effect of Flavopiridol and Navitoclax on these cells.
CDKs have received considerable attention as
major targets for anti-cancer drugs, and more than 20

compounds that inhibit CDK9 and other CDKs have
entered in different phases of clinical trials [40, 41]. The
anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of these drugs
on lymphomas and leukemias [40, 42, 43] have been
pursued through preclinical development and clinical trial.
However their effects on solid tumours, and particularly in
breast cancers, have not been as extensively studied. One
potential drawback with many of the current compounds
is their activity against multiple CDKs - although this has
also been proposed as a benefit - and consequently, the
limited information regarding the precise mechanisms of
their anti-tumour actions. Our present data together with
our previously-published data [12], show the activity
of CDK9i against ER+ve/MYB+ve breast cancer cells and
provide a mechanistic basis for this activity.
Our data also highlight the potential for
development and use of these compounds, including
highly selective CDK9i, in treating ER+ve breast cancer
through concurrent inhibition of MYB, MCL-1 and other
regulators of apoptosis. This will need to be pursued
through preclinical models including cell line-based or
patient-derived xenograft studies in mice. More broadly
our data suggest that targeting transcription regulation
of MYB with CDK9i might be a viable approach in other
MYB-dependent cancer types, since BCL-2 and/or other
apoptotic regulators are also regulated by MYB in myeloid
leukaemias, T-cell leukemias and colon cancers.

Drabsch, et al.[4] Stable MCF-7 cell lines expressing
MYB or harbouring MYB shRNA were selected on GFP
fluorescence (MoFlo Astrios, Beckman Coulter). For
shRNA mediated knockdown 2.5x106 MCF-7C5 Myb or
control MCF-7 Luc cells, were incubated 5 days without
or with 5µg/ml Doxycyline. Subsequent expression of
MYB proteins was analysed by western blotting.

Cell viability assay
These assays were performed in 96-well plates with
1x103 cells seeded one day before the drug treatment in
a total volume of 0.2ml for 72h. Cells were harvested
thereafter and assayed using Resazurin described [16]
using FLUOstar Omega-BMG plate reader. All assays
were performed in

siRNA transfection
Four individual ON-Target plus siRNAs’ targeted to
human MCL-1 were purchased from Dharmacon siRNA
library. MCF-7 cells were seeded 1x105 cells / well of a
12 well plate one day before transfection. Transfection
experiment was carried out using Lipofectamin-2000
reagent following the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen,
USA). Cells were incubated for 72h and harvested for
western bloting and apoptosis assay using Annexinn/PI
staining.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

cDNA synthesis and q-PCR

Cell culture

Approximately 0.5x106 cells were harvested 4h after
drug treatment and RNA was isolated using an Invitorgen
RNA isolation kit. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried
out according to the manufacturers protocol (ABI High
capacity cDNA synthesis kit, Thermofischer) from 2µg
of RNA sample. To detect MYB intronic transcripts, the
cDNA synthesis was carried out using a Superscript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) with Oligo ( dT)20 primers
following the temperature cycle 250C for 10min (1X),
500C for 75min (1X) and 850C for 5min (1X). Primers
used in q-PCR to detect gene expression, except MCL1 (Forward 5′-AAGCCAATGGGCAGGTCT-3′, Reverse

intron (Forward 5’-TTGCTTTTTCCCAGATGAGC-3’,
Reverse 5’-GCTAAGTGTGCTGGGGTCTT-3’) were
described earlier [4, 12]. Unless otherwise mentioned, all
q-PCR experiments were performed in triplicate and the
error bars indicating standard deviation (SD).

MCF-7 cells were maintained in culture as a
monolayer in DMEM supplemented with 10%FBS (Hy
CloneTM,), 1mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1mM non-essential
amino acids, 10µg/ml insulin, Penicillin-Streptomycin
(Invitrogen). T47D and ZR-75 cells were maintained in
RPMI containing 10%FBS, 10µg/ml insulin, PenicilinStreptomycin. HEK293, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468
and BT-10 cell lines were maintained in DMEM
containing 10% FBS, and Penicilin-Streptomycin.
