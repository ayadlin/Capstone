BACKGROUND. Approximately 30% to 40% of all patients with osteosarcomas ultimately experience recurrence. The study investigated the hypothesis that the resistance of osteosarcoma to chemotherapy may be related to the expression of a
pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR) variant protein and its role as the major
inducer of P450 3A4 in these tumors.

METHODS. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis were used
to determine PXR mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Real-time PCR and
CYP3A catalytic activity using 7-benzyl-trifluoromethyl coumarin (BFC) as the
probe substrate were used to measure the induction of P450 3A4 or MDR1. siRNA
transfections were performed for PXR and cytotoxicity determined by a colorimetric based assay or Annexin v-Fitc staining.

RESULTS. Differences were observed in the molecular size of the PXR protein
expressed in sarcoma cell lines when compared with the wildtype PXR expressed
in normal liver, kidney, or small intestine. A polyclonal PXR antibody raised

number of xenobiotics.5,6 P450 3A4 is a major Phase
I drug-metabolizing enzyme involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics to active and inactive metabolites and which activates several potent chemical
carcinogens.7 MDR1 is a gene whose product (P-glycoprotein, PGP) is believed to play an important role
in the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy by
acting as an extruding pump, reducing the accumulation of drugs and cytotoxic agents in these cells.8
Several reports have described the important role of
PGP in the resistance of human osteosarcomas to
chemotherapy.9,10 A number of clinical trials have
attempted to alter PGP activity and thus improve
clinical outcomes11–13; however, the majority of these
studies showed no clear-cut success. We hypothesized that modulation of these target genes involved
in drug metabolism and transport by PXR may play
an important role in the mechanisms for drug resistance observed in some osteosarcoma patients.
In the current study we found that a variant
form of PXR is expressed in osteosarcoma cells that
does not respond to rifampin, but does respond to
etoposide or doxorubicin to induce P450 3A4 and
MDR1, correlating with drug resistance. This receptor
also plays a major role in modulating the expression
of P450 3A4 in osteosarcoma cell lines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Acquisition and Characterization of Cell Lines
Normal human liver (NL), kidney, and small intestine
cells, as well as tumor samples from the Ewings and
synovial sarcoma WW were derived by dissociation
of tissues into single cells using a 40-lm metal mesh.
Collection and handling of human samples was done
using procedures approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Michigan Medical
Center. The OS187, WOL, and COL osteosarcoma cell
lines have been described previously.14 LS174T/
LS180, a colon adenocarcinoma cell line, and HepG2,
a hepatoma cell line, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).
Primary tumors were maintained in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 1% insulin trans-sel-X 100X, 1%
penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine purchased from GIBCO (Grand Island, NY). LS174T and
HepG2 cells were maintained using complete DMEM
components but without the 1% insulin trans-sel-X
100X. Whole cell lysates from the BT20 breast cancer
cell line and the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line
were generous gifts from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). Chemotherapeutic agents were
obtained from the University of Michigan Compre-

hensive Cancer Center Pharmacy or purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). LS174T, HepG2 cells, or NL,
kidney, and small intestine, all characterized for wildtype PXR, were used as positive controls whenever
possible. Concentrations that inhibited cell proliferation by 50% (IC50 values) were established for all
agents used in all cell lines by standard methods.15
The concentrations of the chemotherapeutic agents
used for subsequent studies were less than or equal
to the IC50 in all cell lines unless otherwise stated.

Determination of Expression of P450 3A4, PXR, and
MDR1 mRNA by RT-PCR
Total mRNA was isolated from cells treated with
50 lM etoposide,16 25 lM doxorubicin, 200 lM ifosfamide, or 30 lM rifampin for 48 hours or from
untreated cells using the TriZol method (Invitrogen,
La Jolla, CA). cDNA was synthesized from RNA (1 lg)
using a first strand synthesis kit for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Retroscript, Ambion, Austin TX, or Promega, Madison WI),
or Superscript and PE Sybr Green. Quantitative RTPCR (QT-PCR) was carried out with the following

real-time PCR was used to determine differences in
mRNA expression compared with the liver cells or
LS174T positive controls.17,18

scrambled sequence does not match any human
genome sequence. Transfection of siRNA was conducted with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, OS187 and HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded into 6-well
plates at concentrations of 4 3 105 per well in triplicate for 24 hours before siRNA transfection. The cells
were then transfected with 100 nM PXR siRNA and
incubated with the transfection complexes for 24, 48,
and 72 hours. At the end of the experiment the cells
were trypsinized and the cell number was determined using the Trypan blue exclusion method for
the cytotoxic assay. Fifty micrograms of the whole
cell lysates from each sample were used for immunoblotting analysis as described below to determine
the gene-silencing efficiency.

Western Blot Analysis of PXR and P450 3A4
Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell
lysates obtained from the osteosarcoma primary cell
lines, the LS174T colon cancer cells, or human tissue
samples of the liver, small intestine, and kidney.
Escherichia coli expressed human P450 3A4 protein
samples purified in our laboratory were run in parallel as positive controls. PXR expression was determined using anti-PXR antibodies A-20 and N-19
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or anti-PXR antibodies from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) at 1:1000 dilutions, all of which detected PXR at the same
molecular size.19 P450 3A4 expression was determined using an anti-P450 3A4 antibody (a gift from
Dr. Kan He, Bristol Meyers Squibb, Princeton, NJ).
The secondary antibodies, antigoat for PXR (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), antisheep for P450 3A4 (a gift
from Dr. Kan He), and antimouse for actin (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were used to probe
membranes using the enhanced chemiluminescent
assay (ECL) from Pierce (Rockford, IL) for the detection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated to
secondary antibodies.
Determination of CYP3A Catalytic Activity in
Osteosarcoma Cell Lines Using the P450 3A4 Probe
Substrate, 7-Benzyl-trifluoromethyl Coumarin (BFC)
BFC is metabolized by P450 3A4 to give the highly
fluorescent 7-hydroxy-4(trifluoromethyl) coumarin
that can readily be detected spectrofluorometrically.20,21 Cells (100,000/mL) were seeded in phenolred free DMEM. LS174T cells or HepG2 cells were
used for positive controls. All cells were incubated
with or without rifampin (30 lM), ketoconazole (10 lM),
etoposide (25–150 lM), doxorubicin (25–50 lM), or

959

ifosfamide (400 lM) for 24 or 48 hours as indicated.
Cells were detached with trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated in phenol-red free DMEM containing 50 lM 7-benzyl4(trifluoromethyl) coumarin. After 4–6 hours the supernatant was collected, centrifuged, and transferred
into a clean Eppendorf tube. Stop solution (80%
CH3CN þ 20% 0.5 M Tris base) equal to 40% of the
reaction volume was added and the samples were
read on an RF-5301 PC Spectrofluorophotometer
(Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Wooddale, IL)
using an excitation wavelength of 410 nm and an
emission wavelength of 530 nm. Each experiment
was conducted with duplicate samples. The induction of P450 3A4 activity by rifampin in the LS174T
or HepG2 cells was used as positive control.

Cytotoxic Response of Cells Exposed to Etoposide Alone
or in Combination With Ketoconazole
The Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA) was
used according to the manufacturer’s protocol to
determine apoptosis of etoposide-treated COL or
OS187 cells that were analyzed using a Coulter Elite
ESP Cell Sorter from Beckman (Fullerton, CA). We
also determined the effect of ketoconazole on the
response of COL to etoposide using the Trypan blue
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) exclusion method.22 All cytotoxicity assays were further confirmed using either a
colorimetric assay based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,
Vienna, Austria) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in
viable cells23 or the release of lactate dehydrogenases
(LDH) for nonviable cells.24

RESULTS
Expression of PXR in Primary and
Stable Sarcoma Cell Lines
Figure 1A is a representative figure showing the differential expression of mRNA for PXR in a number of
primary and stable sarcoma cell lines. Expression of
PXR in the stable osteosarcoma cell line MG63 has
previously been reported by Tabb et al.25 The expression level was arbitrarily set at 1 for MG63. The colon
adenocarcinoma cell line LS180, known for exhibiting
high expression levels of PXR, was used as a positive
control. Our results suggest that there is significant
variation in the expression levels of PXR mRNA (over
a 1000-fold range) in the sarcoma cell lines tested,
with the highest expression found in primary synovial sarcoma cells and the lowest expression determined in the liposarcoma cell line. Because there
were variations in PXR expression in the various

Expression of a Disparately Sized PXR Variant
Protein in Osteosarcoma
We determined the expression of the PXR protein in
a number of osteosarcoma primary cell lines (OS187,
COL, and WOL), Ewings sarcoma, and a synovial sarcoma, WW. Using Western blot analysis with antibodies against various epitopes of the PXR protein, we
investigated the molecular size of PXR in these cell
lines and compared it to PXR expressed in normal
liver, kidney, or small intestine.25,26 Negative controls
consisted of the lung adenocarcinoma cell line
A54927 and the breast cancer cell line BT20 as previously described (data not shown).28 Higher levels of
PXR protein were detected in the osteosarcoma cell
line COL compared with OS187 cells (Fig. 2) (A20).
The PXR protein expressed in the osteosarcoma cell
lines exhibited a molecular size approximately 1000
Da lower than PXR protein variant 1 (PXR1) and
approximately 1000 Da higher than PXR variant 2
(PXR2).29 This size difference was confirmed when a
mixture of whole cell lysates from OS187 cells and
small intestine was subjected to Western blot analysis. Electrophoretic separation of the mixture of PXR
proteins expressed in small intestine and OS187 cells
revealed 3 distinct bands after probing with the antiPXR antibody (data not shown). We considered the
possibility that the reduced size of the PXR protein
expressed in the osteosarcoma cells might be due to
a mutation or truncation in the N-terminal region of
the PXR protein. In order to investigate this possibility, we used a PXR1 antibody (N19) raised against an

PXR and Drug Resistance/Mensah-Osman et al.

epitope located in the N-terminal region at amino
acids 1–20 of the PXR protein and found that it
detected the expression of PXR1 alone, and only in
the liver, small intestine, and kidney, but not in the
osteosarcoma cell lines, as shown in Figure 2.
Finally, we determined the protein levels of P450 3A4
in the different cell lines that also showed variable
expression.

PXR siRNA Significantly Down-regulates the Expression
of P450 3A4 in the Osteosarcoma Cell Line OS187
Compared With HepG2 Cells
To test the hypothesis that PXR is the critical regulator of P450 3A4 in osteosarcoma cells, we analyzed
the effects of inhibiting the expression of endogenous PXR on the expression of P450 3A4 protein
using siRNA-mediated gene knockdown. We synthesized a number of different siRNAs corresponding to
distinct regions of human PXR spanning the n-terminal, conserved region with the DNA binding domain,
and the c-terminal region. When these siRNAs for
PXR were transfected into OS187 cells, there was significant down-regulation of endogenous PXR expression levels. Controls consisted of siRNA scrambled
oligos or siRNA block-it, a fluorescent oligo used to
determine transfection efficacy (Fig. 3A). Down-regulation of PXR protein significantly lowered the
expression of endogenous P450 3A4 protein in these
cells. In Figure 3B we show that silencing of the PXR
gene only modestly down-regulated P450 3A4 expression in HepG2 cells compared with the OS187 cell
line. Thus, whereas PXR siRNA efficiently knocked
down endogenous PXR levels in OSI87 and HepG2
cells, P450 3A4 levels were down-regulated only in
the OS187 cell line, indicating that PXR plays a critical role as a regulator of P450 3A4 expression in the
osteosarcoma cell line, but not in the HepG2 cells.
Variant PXR Protein Expressed in Osteosarcoma Cell
Lines Induces P450 3A4 and MDR1 in Response to
Etoposide But Not Rifampin
Rifampin is known to activate wildtype PXRmediated transcription leading to increased P450 3A4
expression and enzymatic activity.4 To further test
the hypothesis that the PXR variant expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines regulates the ligand-dependent
transcription of target genes differently from wildtype PXR expressed in the colon adenocarcinoma
cell line, LS174T, we investigated the ability of the
PXR-ligands rifampin and etoposide to increase the
mRNA levels of P450 3A4 and MDR1 in both cell
lines using QT-PCR. Figure 4 shows that in the osteosarcoma cell line etoposide increased P450 3A4
mRNA expression by 30-fold and MDR1 expression

FIGURE 3. (A) Effect of treatment with PXR siRNA on the expression of
P450 3A4 in OS187 cells. Cells were transfected with siRNA for PXR, along
with siRNA scramble sequence or the sequence for fluorescent oligos

anti-PXR antibody or anti-P450 3A4 antibody. The membranes were reprobed
for actin. (B) Effect of treatment with PXR siRNA on the expression of P450

by 3.8-fold. In these cells rifampin had no effect on
P450 3A4 expression, even though it induced MDR1
expression by 3.6-fold, similar to etoposide. However,
in LS174T, colon adenocarcinoma cells, rifampin
increased the mRNA of P450 3A4 more than 140-fold
and MDR1 by approximately 5-fold, whereas etoposide had no effect on the expression of P450 3A4 and
MDR1 mRNA in these cell lines. Zhuo et al.30 demonstrated that etoposide is unable to induce P450
3A4 through wildtype PXR due to the presence of a
repressor that may bind to the N-terminus and
would be predicted to have no effect on a variant
PXR with a mutation at the 50 flanking sequence.16
Indeed, their report supports our findings because
etoposide but not rifampin induced the expression of
PXR target genes in osteosarcoma cell lines that
express a PXR with a mutation in the N-terminal
region of the protein.

Rifampin Has No Effect on P450 3A4 Metabolic Activity
in Osteosarcoma Cell Lines
We further investigated if there was a correlation
between the rifampin induction of P450 3A4 mRNA
and increase in P450 3A4 catalytic activity. In Figure 5
we show that rifampin is a potent inducer of P450
3A4 activity in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line
LS174T consistent with an increase in mRNA levels
(Fig. 4). Rifampin, however, did not induce the catalytic activity of P450 3A4 in COL cells, and only modestly induced P450 3A4 in OS187 cells.
Effect of Etoposide, Doxorubicin, or Ifosfamide

which are used for the treatment of osteosarcoma, to
increase P450 3A4 mRNA levels and compared them

in the expression of P450 3A4 mRNA in the COL
osteosarcoma cell line, which expresses higher levels
of the PXR protein compared with OS187, as shown
in Figure 2. Additionally, doxorubicin increased the
expression levels of P450 3A4 mRNA only in COL
cells, whereas ifosfamide caused a modest induction
of P450 3A4 mRNA only in the OS187 cells.

Effect of Etoposide, Doxorubicin, or Ifosfamide on P450
3A4 Enzymatic Activity in Osteosarcoma Cell Lines
We further investigated if the increase in P450 3A4
mRNA caused by etoposide in the COL cells correlated with an increase in P45 3A4 metabolic activity.
Figure 7 shows that etoposide increased P450 3A4
metabolic activity only in the COL cell line, and this
activity was reversed with the addition of the P450
3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole. Neither doxorubicin nor
ifosfamide had an effect on P450 3A4 catalytic activity in either cell line.

and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD). Viable cells do not stain with either reagent. Staining with 7-AAD alone indicates necrotic cells. Staining with
Annexin V identifies apoptotic cells and 7AAD staining separates early apoptotic (7AAD) from late apoptotic (7AADþ) cells. (B) Viable COL cells

PXR Confers Resistance to Etoposide in
Osteosarcoma Cells
To determine if induction of P450 3A4 enzymatic activity by etoposide correlated with resistance in COL
cells, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of etoposide
on COL and OS187 cell lines. As shown in Figure 8A,
etoposide induced apoptosis in the majority of
OS187 cells, but caused only a slight increase in the
percentage of COL cells undergoing apoptosis.

Because ketoconazole reversed the metabolic activity
induced by etoposide, we hypothesized that resistance of COL cells to etoposide will also be reversed if
cells are exposed to both agents. In Figure 8B we
show that the resistance of COL cells to etoposide
was decreased upon 24-hour pretreatment of cells
with ketoconazole before etoposide exposure. Addition of etoposide and ketoconazole simultaneously

was a less effective regime at 24 and 48 hours in the
osteosarcoma cell line compared with the sequential
exposure. This indicates that inhibition of P450 3A4
activity by ketoconazole indeed sensitizes the COL
cells to etoposide in a schedule-dependent manner.

DISCUSSION
Approximately 40% of osteosarcoma patients do not
achieve the desired results after chemotherapy. Drug
resistance is believed to be the most common reason
for the failure of chemotherapy in these patients.31

remains obscure and an improved understanding of
its role may reveal that it is an important determinant for clinical outcomes.
PXR is predominately expressed in the liver,
small intestine, and kidney and has been shown to
act as a xenobiotic sensor for the regulation of a
number of genes including P450 3A4 and MDR1.32
Recent reports have shown that PXR is also expressed
in endometrial and breast cancer cells19,28 and plays
an important role in vitamin D and bone homeostasis.33 However, the functional implications of PXR
expression in these tumors are not clear.
We have demonstrated that PXR is expressed in
a number of primary and secondary sarcoma cell
lines. Whereas a number of PXR variants have been
reported previously, our results show for the first
time that a variant form of PXR is expressed in osteosarcoma cells and is recognized differently by antibodies raised against different epitopes. Interestingly,
the disparately sized PXR variant expressed in these
cell lines correlates approximately with a PXR variant
reported by Hustert et al.34 that is 1.7 kDa lower in
molecular size than the wildtype. The inability of an
antibody against the N-terminal region of the protein
to detect PXR in these cell lines, and the reduced
molecular size of the receptor compared with wildtype, suggests a splice variant with a truncated or
modified N-terminal. The N-terminal region of
the PXR protein contains the AF-1 region, which
plays a role in ligand-mediated transcription of target
genes.35,36 Our results suggest that a mutation on the
50 -flanking region of the PXR protein may have an
effect on the etoposide-induced PXR-transcription of
P450 3A4 in the osteosarcoma cell lines, consistent
with data from Koyano et al.29
Our results also show that PXR regulates the
expression of P450 3A4 in osteosarcoma and that the
induction of P450 3A4 activity via this receptor may
be an important mechanism for drug resistance. The
regulation of MDR1 in osteosarcomas appears to
involve a mechanism independent of PXR because

we observed no differences in the induction of
MDR1 mRNA (Fig. 3) or PGP activity (data not
shown) by either etoposide or rifampin. Additionally,
we have observed that CITCO, a ligand specific for
the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), which
may play a role in the induction of P450 3A4,37
exhibited no effect on the induction of P450 3A4 in
the osteosarcoma cell lines tested (data not shown),
ruling out CAR as a possible regulator.
In conclusion, we have determined that a variant
PXR protein is expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines.
PXR is the major regulator of P450 3A4 protein
expression in these tumors and the activity of its target genes appears to correlate with drug resistance.
We determined that etoposide increased the expression and catalytic activity of P450 3A4 in the osteosarcoma cell line that expressed higher levels of the
PXR protein that correlated with etoposide resistance. Pretreatment of osteosarcoma cells with ketoconazole, a PXR antagonist before exposure to
etoposide, significantly increased the sensitivity of
these cells to the selected chemotherapeutic agents.
The use of compounds such as ketoconazole may be
of value for the treatment of patients exhibiting high
levels of PXR in their tumor biopsies.
