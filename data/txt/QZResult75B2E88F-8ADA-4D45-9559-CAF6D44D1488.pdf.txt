ABSTRACT
The chemotherapeutic agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most commonly used
drug for patients with advanced colon cancer. However, development of resistance
to 5-FU is inevitable in almost all patients. The mechanism by which colon cancer
develops 5-FU resistance is still unclear. One recently proposed theory is that cancer
stem-like cells underlie colon cancer 5-FU resistance, but the phenotypes of 5-FUresistant colon cancer stem cells are still controversial. We report here that 5-FU
treatment selectively enriches a subset of CD133+ colon cancer cells in vitro. 5-FU
chemotherapy also increases CD133+ tumor cells in human colon cancer patients.
However, sorted CD133+ colon cancer cells exhibit no increased resistance to 5-FU,
and CD133 levels exhibit no correlation with colon cancer patient survival or cancer
recurrence. Genome-wide analysis of gene expression between sorted CD133+ colon
cancer cells and 5-FU-selected colon cancer cells identifies 207 differentially expressed
genes. CD24 is one of the genes whose expression level is lower in the CD133+ and
5-FU-resistant colon cancer cells as compared to CD133+ and 5-FU-sensitive colon
cancer cells. Consequently, CD133+CD24lo cells exhibit decreased sensitivity to 5-FU.
Therefore, we determine that CD133+CD24lo phenotype defines 5-FU-resistant human
colon cancer stem cell-like cells.

and functionally distinct from the majority of the tumor
cell population. These cells are referred to as colon cancer
stem cells (CSC) or colon cancer-initiating cells (C-IC)
[6–10]. 5-FU is an S phase-specific cytotoxic agent that
selectively targets rapidly proliferating cells, such as
tumor cells. CSCs or C-ICs, including colorectal CSCs,
are quiescent or slowly cycling cells; 5-FU may therefore
kill the rapidly dividing cancer cell population to enrich
the rare subsets of colorectal CSCs. Indeed, recent studies
have shown that 5-FU treatment selectively enriches
subsets of colon cancer cells with colon CSC phenotypes
[11–16].
Emerging experimental data suggest the majority of
colon tumors contain subpopulations of CSCs or C-ICs
[17–19]. CD133 is the most commonly used marker for
human colorectal CSCs [8, 9, 20–28]. CD44 is a major

INTRODUCTION
The chemotherapeutic agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU),
in combination with other cytotoxic or targeted agents,
is a standard adjuvant therapy for certain human patients
with stage 2 colorectal cancer and almost all patients
with stages 3 and 4 colorectal cancer [1–3]. However,
development of cancer cell resistance to 5-FU is almost
inevitable in colorectal cancer patients [4], resulting
in tumor recurrence and metastasis to distant organs,
primarily to the liver, which accounts for over 90% of
human colorectal cancer mortality [5]. The mechanism
underlying colorectal cancer 5-FU resistance is largely
unknown. Recent studies suggests that the 5-FU-resistant
colorectal cancer cells represent a subset of tumor cells
in the original tumor population that are phenotypically

hyaluronan receptor that has been extensively studied as
another human colorectal CSC marker [18, 23, 27–34].
In addition, several other markers, including CD24 [27,
35], CD26 [17] and CD166 [19, 27, 29, 31, 36] have
been identified as potential human colon CSC markers.
However, although these colorectal CSC markers have
been identified and characterized extensively in both cell
lines and tumor tissues, no consensus has been reached
regarding the general phenotypes that define human
colorectal CSCs [29], as these markers are reversible
and may vary according to tumor types, stages and
chemotherapies [14, 26, 37]. Furthermore, the phenotypes
of CSCs, including colorectal CSCs, have significant
plasticity that is driven by not only intrinsic factors but also
by the dynamic changes in the tumor microenvironment
[6, 38–41]. New studies are continuously reported to
further define colorectal CSC phenotypes, mainly through
combinations of markers [15, 27, 28, 42–45].
Although colorectal CSC markers have been
studied as biomarkers for colorectal cancer prognosis
[20, 21, 24, 25, 46, 47], the most clinically relevant
value of CSCs, including colorectal CSCs, is perhaps
their putative role as the origin of chemoresistance [1115, 48]. The first indication that colorectal CSCs are
responsible for resistance to 5-FU came from studies
of isolated primary colon cancer cells. Isolated CD133+
primary human colon cancer cells were observed to be
highly resistant to 5-FU, whereas the unpurified cancer
cells or purified CD133- cells from the same human colon
cancer specimens showed a high sensitivity to 5-FU [49].
However, it seems that not all CD133+ colon cancer cells
are colon CSCs since only approximately 1 out of 262
CD133+ colon tumor cells are estimated to be colon CSCs
[8]. We therefore hypothesize that a subset of CD133+
human colon cancer cells are 5-FU-resistant colon CSCs
and carried out this study to test this hypothesis. To this
end, we determined that a subset of CD133+CD24lo colon
cancer cells represent colon CSCs that underlie colon
cancer 5-FU resistance.

cell surface markers revealed that the majority of LS411N5FU-R cells are CD133+CD44+ (Figure 1C), whereas the
majority of SW620-5FU-R cells are CD133+CD44-. These
observations suggest that CD133+ and/or CD44+ colon
cancer cells are associated with 5-FU resistance.

CD133 and CD44 expression are not correlated
with sphere formation potential in colon cancer
cells
CD133 and CD44 have been proposed as markers
of colon CSCs [10, 18]. We sought to determine the
relationship between CD133/CD44 expression and colon
cancer cell sphere formation potential. Seven human colon
cancer cell lines were analyzed for CD133 and CD44
expression on their surface. CD133+ and CD133+CD44+
cells are rare populations in all seven cell lines. In contrast,
more than 37% of cells are CD44+ in four of the seven
human colon carcinoma cell lines (Supplementary Figure
S1A and S1B). Analysis of sphere formation potential of
the seven cell lines revealed that three cell lines (LS411N,
SW620 and T84) possess high sphere formation capability,
whereas the other four cell lines exhibit very low sphere
formation capability (Supplementary Figure S1C).

5-FU therapy increases CD133+ tumor
population in human colon cancer patients
To determine whether the observation that 5-FU
treatment selectively enriches CD133+ colon cancer cells
in vitro can be extended to human colon cancer patients,
colon carcinoma tissues from human patients with and
without prior 5-FU therapies were stained with CD133specific antibodies and analyzed for CD133 protein
expression. One of the five colon carcinoma tissues from
human patients without 5-FU therapy expresses CD133,
albeit at a low level. The remaining four tumor tissues
have no detectable CD133 (Figure 2 U1-5). In contrast,
four of the five colon carcinoma tissues from human
patients treated with 5-FU have high levels of CD133
protein (Figure 2 F1-5). Therefore, 5-FU therapy enriches
CD133+ colon cancer cells in human colon carcinoma
tissues.

RESULTS
5-FU selectively enriches CD133+ colon cancer
cells in vitro

CD133 protein level is not a prognostic marker
in human colorectal cancer

Human colon carcinoma LS411N and SW620
cells were cultured in the presence of increasing
concentrations of 5-FU. Cells that survived 2.0 μg/ml
5-FU were established as cell lines and termed LS411N5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R, respectively (Figure 1A).
The 5-FU-resistant cell lines were then compared to
the respective parent cell lines for their sensitivity to
5-FU. Both LS411N-5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R cells
exhibited decreased sensitivity to 5-FU as compared to
the respective parent cell lines (Figure 1B). Analysis of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The above observations indicate that 5-FU enriches
CD133+ tumor cells in human colon cancer patients.
Because almost all human colon cancer patients inevitably
develop resistance to 5-FU therapy, we next sought to
determine whether CD133+ tumor cells are correlated with
human colorectal cancer patient disease outcomes. CD133
protein levels were analyzed in tumor specimens from
147 colorectal cancer patients and correlated to disease
outcomes. No correlation was observed between CD133

are responsible for 5-FU resistance, CD133+ and CD133cells were sorted from the parent LS411N (Figure 3A) and
SW620 (Figure 3B) cells, respectively to establish four
cell sublines: LS411N-CD133+, LS411N-CD133-, SW620CD133+ and SW620-CD133-. The four sublines of cells
were then tested for their sensitivity to 5-FU. Analysis of
cell viability indicates that CD133+ colon cancer cells and
CD133- colon cancer cells derived from both human colon
cancer cell lines exhibit no differences in their sensitivity
to 5-FU (Figure 3A and 3B).

CD133 alone does not define a 5-FU-resistant
phenotype
The above observations indicate that 5-FU enriches
CD133+ human colon cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo,
but CD133 alone does not define the colorectal cancer
disease outcome. To determine whether CD133+ cells

Genome-wide gene expression profiles of 5-FUresistant human colon cancer cells

but whose high expression level is proposed as a CSC
marker in colon cancer cells [23, 33, 35, 36, 50-53], is
lower in both LS411N-5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R cells
than that in LS411N-CD133+ and SW620-CD133+ cells
(Figure 4C).

Both LS411N-5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R cells are
CD133+ and resistant to 5-FU (Figure 1). However, while
both LS411N-CD133+ and SW620-CD133+ cell lines are
CD133+, they are still as sensitive to 5-FU as CD133cells (Figure 3). Therefore, we reasoned that LS411N5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R represent only small subsets of
CD133+ cells in LS411N-CD133+ and SW620-CD133+ cell
lines. To identify these subsets of 5-FU-resistant CD133+
cells, we set up two comparisons: LS411N-CD133+ vs
LS411N-5FU-R and SW620-CD133+ vs SW620-5FU-R.
We then performed genome-wide gene expression
analysis (Figure 4A). The rationale is that differentially
expressed genes may define the 5-FU-resistant subsets of
cells. A total of 1599 and 2099 genes were differentially
expressed between LS411N-CD133+ and LS411N-5FU-R
and between SW620-CD133+ and SW620-5FU-R cells
(respectively) by a 2 fold cutoff. Among these genes, 207
genes are differentially expressed in both pairs of cells
(Figure 4B). Some of these 207 genes (such as LGR5 and
SOX2) have known functions in stem cell maintenance.
Other genes have known functions in cellular proliferation
and death (including PCNA, DUSO5, DUSP6 and
DUSP10, NFKB2, CASP3 and MLKL), whereas two
genes (IL17RB and IL20RB) function in immune
response and inflammation (Figure 4C). Interestingly, the
expression level of CD24, a gene whose absence/lower
expression level is used as a CSC marker in breast cancer

CD133+CD24lo colon cancer cells exhibit
decreased sensitivity to 5-FU
Both CD24hi and CD24lo cells have been shown
to possess cancer stem cell properties [50–55]. Our
above observation that CD24 expression is lower in
5-FU-resistant LS411N-5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R
cells led us to hypothesize that CD133+CD24lo cells
may represent 5-FU-resistant colon CSCs. To test this
hypothesis, CD24lo cells were sorted from LS411NCD133+ and SW620-CD133+ cells (Figure 5A and 5B)
and examined for their sensitivity to 5-FU. Analysis
of cell viability revealed that LS411N-CD133+CD24lo
and SW620-CD133+CD24lo cells exhibit decreased
sensitivity to 5-FU as compared to LS411N-CD133+ and
SW620-CD133+ cells (Figure 6). LS411N and SW620
cells are advanced human colon carcinoma cells and
the majority of these tumor cells have a mesenchymal
cell phenotype. Both LS411N and SW620 cells exhibit
high sphere formation capability (Supplementary Figure
S1). We also compared sphere formation capability
between the four subsets of SW620 cells and observed
that the CD133+CD24lo cells showed further higher
sphere formation capability that the other three subsets

cells, respectively. The cells were stained with CD133- and CD44-specific antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry (top panel). The two
subsets of cells were cultured in the presence of 5-FU at the indicated concentrations for 3 days and analyzed for viability by MTT assays.

express higher level of ALDH

of cells (Supplementary Figure S3). Taken together, our
data determine that CD133+CD24lo may represent 5-FUresistant colon CSCs phenotypes.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) has been
proposed to be a human colon CSC marker [56, 57]. To
determine whether ALDH protein level is associated
with 5-FU-resistant human colon carcinoma cells, we
measured ALDH protein level in the four sets of human
colon carcinoma cell subsets. It is clear that ALDH is
significantly higher in CD133+CD24lo cells as compared
to the parent and CD133+ cell lines (Figure 8).

CD24 colon carcinoma cells exhibit less
sensitivity to 5-FU and a mesenchymal cell
phenotype

To validate the above finding, we sorted CD24lo
cells directly from LS411N and SW620 cells. Analysis
of sensitivity of the CD24hi and CD24lo cells to 5-FU
indicates that the CD24lo SW620 cells exhibit less
sensitivity to 5-FU than the CD24hi cells (Figure 7A).
Furthermore, analysis of vimentin mRNA level revealed
that CD24lo cells in both LS411N and SW620 cells express
dramatically higher levels of vimentin than the respective
CD24hi cells (Figure 7B).

DISCUSSION
Human CD24 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored membrane protein expressed on lymphocytic
and myeloid cells that functions as an adhesion molecule

and modulates growth and differentiation signals to these
cells [58]. CD24 is also expressed on non-hematopoietic
cells, including solid cancer cells [59, 60]. CD24 clearly
mediates diverse functions in both hematopoietic cells and
non-hematopoietic cells. In immune cells, in addition to
its function in cellular growth and differentiation, ligation
of CD24 also triggers a caspase-dependent apoptosis
in neutrophils [61]. In non-hematopoietic cells, a large
body of literatures has implicated CD24 expression
in tumorigenesis and progression in a wide range of
epithelial cancers including pancreatic, prostate, ovarian,
breast and colorectal cancers [19, 23, 36, 50-53, 60,
62, 63]. In this study, we observed that CD24 is highly
expressed on human colon carcinoma cells. However, we
also observed that although CD24 is highly expressed in
the human colon carcinoma cell lines, a small population
(0.12-1.66%) of human colon carcinoma cells express low
intensity of CD24, suggesting the heterogeneity of CD24expressing cells in human colon carcinoma cells.

In human colorectal cancer, CD24 expression is
significantly correlated to late tumor stages and lymph
node metastasis. In a survival study, CD24 expression
correlated significantly to shortened patient survival [62].
Consistent with its function in tumor progression and
metastasis, CD24+ human colon carcinoma cells have
been shown to possess cancer stem cell characteristics [23,
33, 36] and exhibit enhanced chemotherapy-resistance,
self-renewal and tumorigenic capacity both in vitro and
in vivo compared to CD24- subpopulations [54]. In this
study, we compared the genome-wide gene expression
profiles between LS411N-CD133+ and LS411N-5FU-R
and between SW620-CD133+ and SW620-5FU-R cells.
Surprisingly, CD24 expression is significantly lower in
the 5-FU-resistant LS411N-5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R
cells than in LS411N-CD133+ and SW620-CD133+ cells.
Further analysis of cell surface CD24 protein levels
validated our gene-wide gene expression analysis and
revealed that 5-FU treatment enriched not only CD133+

but also CD24lo subsets of human colon carcinoma cells.
However, our observation does not necessarily contradict
the previous observation that CD24+ tumor cells are
subsets of colorectal CSCs since the 5-FU-resistant human
colon carcinoma cells are all CD24+. Instead, we further
defined a subpopulation of the CD24+ cells as the potential
colon CSCs: CD133+CD24lo colon cancer cells.

In contrast to human colon carcinoma cells,
CD24- cells are proposed as breast CSCs [35, 50–53].
Combinations of CD44+CD24- cells have been shown
to possess breast CSC characteristics [53]. Furthermore,
CD44+CD24-/lo breast cancer cells are characteristics
of breast chemoresistant CSCs [52]. Analysis of
CD44+CD24lo cells in human colon carcinoma cell lines

indicated that six of eight human colon carcinoma cell lines
contain a subset of CD44+CD24lo cells (Supplementary
Figure S4A & S4B), and the majority of CD44+CD24lo
cells are also CD133+CD24lo cells (Supplementary Figure
S4C). Therefore, CD133+CD44+CD24lo may represent
a subset of human colon CSCs that are responsible
for human colon cancer 5-FU resistance. The scope of
CD133+CD44+CD24lo as human colon cancer stem cells
and 5-FU resistance biomarker requires further studies
since certain human colon carcinoma cells (i.e. LS411N)
harbor 5-FU-resistant cell subsets but lack CD44+CD24lo
cells.
5-FU treatment of human colon carcinoma cells
resulted in the generation of 5-FU-resistant cells that are
enriched for CD133+ tumor cells, and to a lesser degree,
CD44+ tumor cells [11], suggesting that enrichment of
colon CSCs might be an underlying mechanism of colon
cancer chemoresistance [11, 14, 49]. Approximately one
in 262 CD133+ human colon cancer cells are estimated
to be colon CSCs [8]. Based on these observations, we
generated, by 5-FU selection in the culture medium, the

5-FU-resistant LS411N-5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R cells
which happen to be CD133+ based on flow cytometry
analysis. We also generated, by cell sorting, the LS411NCD133+ and SW620-CD133+ cells which happen to be
5-FU-sensitive based on cell viability assay. Genomewide gene expression profiling of these two models
identified CD24, a known CSC marker in various types of
human cancers [23, 33, 35, 36, 50-53], as a differentially
expressed gene. Further functional studies validate that
CD24lo human colon carcinoma cells, in combination
with CD133+, represent the putative 5-FU-resistant human
colon CSCs. Treatment of human colon carcinoma cells
with high dose of 5-FU did not increase CD133 expression
level or decrease CD24 expression level (Supplementary
Figure S5), suggesting that 5-FU does not regulate CD133
and CD24 expression. Taken together, we have identified
a novel subset of human colon CSCs that may underlie
human colon cancer 5-FU resistance.
In addition to CD24, several other genes,
including genes such as LGR5 and SOX2 with known
functions in human colon stem cell self-renewal and

maintenance [7, 34, 50, 64], have also been identified.
However, it seems that LGR5 protein level is very low
in both LS411N and SW620 cells and is not significantly
different between the 5-FU-sensitive CD133+ cells and
the 5-FU-resistant CD133+CD24lo cells (Supplementary
Figure S6). Furthermore, ALDH levels appear to
be positively correlated with CD133+CD24lo cells.
Therefore, CD133+CD44+CD24loALDHhimay further
define a 5-FU-resistant human colon carcinoma stem
cell phenotype from the CD133+CD24lo cells, which also
requires further studies.
Human colorectal cancers have recently been
classified by the colorectal cancer subtyping consortium
into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS1,
CMS2, CMS3 and CMS4) [65]. CMS4 tumors showed
clear upregulation of genes implicated in epithelialto-mesenchyal transition, tended to be diagnosed at
more advanced stages, and result in worse overall and
relapse-free survivals [66]. Chemoresistance, including
resistance to 5-FU, and resultant tumor recurrence and
metastasis accounts for more than 90% mortality in
human colorectal cancer patients. In this study, we also
observed that CD24lo cells exhibit higher expression level
of vimentin, a mesenchymal cell marker. Therefore, it is
likely that the 5-FU-resistant CD133+CD24lo cells may be
characteristics as a CMS4 colon cancer, which requires
further characterization. Nevertheless, we have determined
that CD133+CD24lo define a 5-FU-resistant human colon
cancer stem cell phenotype.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2-10x103
cells/well in 100 μl culture medium for 3-5 days. Cell
viability assays were performed using the MTT cell
proliferation assay kit (ATCC, Manassas, VA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cells were stained with fluorescent dye-conjugated
anti-CD133 (Miltenyi Biotec), anti-CD44, anti-CD24 and
anti-LGR5 (Biolegend) mAbs. Cells were then analyzed
by flow cytometry.

CD133+ and CD133- cells were sorted from
human colon carcinoma LS411N and SW620 cell lines,
respectively in the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at
Medical University of South Carolina. Four cell lines were
established: LS411N-CD133+, LS411N-CD133-, SW620CD133+ and SW620-CD133-. LS411N-CD133+ and
SW620-CD133+ cells were further sorted into LS411NCD133+CD24lo and SW620-CD133+CD24lo cells from
LS411N-CD133+ and SW620-CD133+ cells, respectively.
CD24hi and CD24lo cells were sorted from LS411N and
SW620 cells in the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at
Medical College of Georgia.

Analysis of colon cancer cell sphere formation

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tumor cells were cultured at 1x105 cells/well in
200 μl DMEM medium plus 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/
ml basic FGF (Pepro Tech). Cells were cultured in ultralow attachment surface polystyrene 96-well plates for 7-21
days.

Human colon cancer specimens and cells
Human colon cancer cell lines RKO, HCT116,
LS411N, COLO205, T84, HT29, SW480, and SW620
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) (Manassas, VA). ATCC has characterized these
cells by morphology, immunology, DNA fingerprint,
and cytogenetics. LS411N-5FU-R and SW620-5FU-R
cells were selected from LS411N and SW620 cells,
respectively, by culturing cells with increasing doses of
5-FU as shown in Figure 1A.

Immunohistochemistry
Human colon carcinoma specimens from patients
without chemotherapy and patients after 5-FU therapy
were provided by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network
(CHTN, Southern Division, University of Alabama,
Birmingham, AL). Each specimen and chemotherapy
history were reviewed by a board-certified pathologist
at the CHTN Division. Human Colon cancer tissue
microarray slides were provided by CHTN (Mid-Atlantic
Division, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA).
The tissue microarrays were designed by the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) pathologists and statisticians for
high statistical power for examination of associations
of markers with patient clinical outcomes. The tissues
were stained with anti-human CD133 antibody
(Miltenyi Biotec). Slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI).

Selection of 5-FU-resistant human colon
carcinoma cell lines
Human colon carcinoma cell lines LS411N and
SW620 cells were cultured in the presence of increasing
5-FU concentrations. 5-FU concentration were started at
0.05 μg/ml. Cells were harvested and cultured again every
7-14 days with increasing 5-FU concentrations 0.05, 0.1,
0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 μg/ml. Cells that survived 2.0 μg/ml 5-FU
are maintained as 5-FU-resistant cell lines.

Kitamura and Chang-Sheng Chang at the GRU Cancer
Center Integrated Genomics Facility for the excellent
technical assistance in genome-wide gene expression.

DNA microarray
RNA was isolated from tumor cells. The quality
of RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and assured by a RNA
Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 7. The Human Gene 2.0ST
array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which covers 30,654
coding transcripts, was used for the gene expression
profiling. Total RNA samples were processed using
the Ambion WT Expression Kit (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) and GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling kit
(Affymetrix). The synthesized sense strand cDNAs were
then fragmented and biotin-labeled using GeneChip WT
Terminal Labeling kit. The labeled cDNAs were hybridized
onto the arrays using Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics
Station 450 systems according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The expression data were imported into Partek
GS version 6.6 using standard import tool with GC-RMA
normalization. The differential expressions were calculated
using ANOVA of Partek package. Differentially expressed
genes were analyzed by clustering and tree view programs
as previously described [67].

ALDH protein measurement
ALDH protein levels were assessed using the
ALDEFLUOR kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Cambridge,
MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were
harvested, washed with ALDEFLUOR Assay Buffer, and
resuspended in ALDEFLUOR Assay Buffer. Samples were
stained with ALDEFLUOR Reagent (5 μL per ml of sample)
and incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. ALDEFLUOR
DEAB Reagent-treated samples were used as negative
controls. Cell samples were washed with ALDEFLUOR
Assay Buffer and analyzed using flow cytometry.

All statistical analysis was performed using SAS
9.2, and statistical significance was assessed using an α
level of 0.05. Kaplan-Meier patient survival and cancer
recurrence analyses were used to examine differences in
time to recurrence by CD133 stain intensity. A log rank
test was used to assess differences in survival between
the groups. Student’s t test was also used to compare
differences between difference treatment groups. A p
<0.05 was taken as statistically significant.
