Is Screening Effective in Detecting Untreated
Psychiatric Disorders Among Newly
Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients?
Steven C. Palmer, PhD1; Alison Taggi, MEd1; Angela DeMichele, MD2; and James C. Coyne, PhD1

BACKGROUND: A key purpose of routine distress screening is to ensure that cancer patients receive appropriate
mental health care. Most studies validating screening instruments overestimate the effectiveness of screening by not
differentiating between patients with untreated disorders and patients who are already being treated. This
study adopts the novel strategy of evaluating the effectiveness of screening after correcting for disorder for which
treatment is already being provided. METHODS: A total of 437 recently diagnosed breast cancer patients received
in-clinic distress screening and telephone-based psychiatric interviews. Analyses were conducted using receipt of
psychotropic medication for mental health difficulties in the context of a psychiatric disorder as a proxy for
identification and treatment. RESULTS: Rates of elevated distress (33%), major depressive disorder (8%), minor
depression (6%), dysthymia (2%), or generalized anxiety disorder (3%) were similar to those in other samples. Thirtysix percent of patients received psychotropic medication around the time of cancer diagnosis, including 64% of those
with a current psychiatric diagnosis. Although 39% of patients with elevated distress had a psychiatric disorder, the
positive predictive value of screening fell to 15% for an untreated psychiatric disorder and 6% had untreated depression. CONCLUSION: Given the high rates of existing treatment, screening may not be efficient for identifying
untreated disorder. Almost two-thirds of patients with treated disorders remain symptomatic. Use of symptom scales
might reasonably be expanded to surveillance of treatment response or ruling out disorder. Substantial resources
would likely be required to coordinate or manage psychiatric care among patients, as would a willingness to

A National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference Statement1 and an Institute of Medicine report2 have identified
detection and management of distress and psychiatric disorder among cancer patients as a priority. Screening is often proposed as a first step in providing appropriate psychosocial and mental health care, and as a means of reducing morbidity
and improving quality of life.3-5 Evidence-based guidelines for managing distress, however, are still being developed.6
Moreover, a considerable proportion of positive screens for distress represents psychiatric disorder, typically 30%-45%.7,8
Such disorders tend to be chronic, episodic, and recurrent. They require more intensive care and longer follow-up, but
have the advantage of an agreed-upon nosology and well-defined, empirically based treatment guidelines. Evaluations of
screening instruments, therefore, typically make gold standard comparisons against validated diagnostic interviews for
psychiatric disorders.9,10
Questions have been raised about the appropriateness of particular screening instruments for specific subgroups of
cancer patients,11,12 though most screening instruments appear to have moderate performance compared with diagnoses
based on psychiatric interviews.10 Even the best performing instrument cannot be used diagnostically, hence screening is
best construed as an initial step in a process in which positive screens are followed by a diagnostic interview.13 Given the
modest prevalence of psychiatric disorders in most cancer populations, however, most positive screens will be found to be
false positives, rendering screening potentially inefficient.8

Routine screening programs assume that screening
provides a means of uncovering distress and psychiatric
disorder that would not otherwise be identified and
treated.14,15 In clinical practice, the interest is not in
detecting patients already being treated, but in those who
would otherwise be missed. A shortcoming of existing
studies of the accuracy and yield of screening tools in cancer care is that they are almost always conducted with all
available patients, including patients who have already
been recognized and are receiving treatment for psychiatric disorder, inflating estimates of the number of patients
in need of treatment that screening can yield. A recent systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of screening
instruments for depression found only 8 of 197 (4.1%)
unique reports from 17 systematic reviews and metaanalyses specifically excluded patients already diagnosed
or being treated for depression.16 Only 2 of these 8 reports
concerned cancer patients,11,17 both of which were from
the same sample, and these simply excluded diagnosed or
currently treated depression without determining the
effect of doing so on screening performance.
Patients with a psychiatric disorder who are already
in treatment may differ from those who are not by having
a more conspicuous disorder or a more positive attitude
about treatment.18 Patients for whom screening represents the only means of identifying psychiatric morbidity
may, therefore, be more difficult to diagnose and require
additional resources to overcome resistance to treatment,
whereas patients who are already in treatment but remain
sufficiently symptomatic to screen positive may require
improved surveillance and greater coordination of care
with outside providers. Routine care for depression in the
community tends to be inadequate, with low adherence,
high rates of unsupervised discontinuation of treatment,
and a lack of scheduled follow-up visits.19,20 These problems suggest the value of surveillance of existing treatment, with a recognition that the clinical resources
required would differ substantially from those required if
the goal were simply initiation of new treatment based on
screening.
We sought to evaluate the performance of screening
among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, comparing
screening results to a validated diagnostic interview, first,
as is typically done, ignoring whether patients were
already in treatment, and, second, taking existing psychotropic treatment into account. We chose newly diagnosed
patients because there is evidence that distress is
most prominent early in the cancer trajectory21-26 and
predicts long-term adaptation.27 Our objectives were to

2736

(1) evaluate the ability of a screening instrument to detect
depression and other psychiatric disorders among a sample of patients in early treatment for breast cancer, and (2)
determine how screening performance is affected when
existing treatment for a disorder is taken into account.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Recently diagnosed breast cancer patients seeking treatment at a comprehensive cancer center were eligible to
participate. Inclusion criteria included age 18-85 years,
ability to understand and speak English, and enrollment
within 5 months of diagnosis and before chemotherapy.
Exclusion criteria included current recurrence of cancer
within 5 years, current substance abuse, and history of
bipolar or psychotic disorders.
Procedure
Potential participants were approached after their first
medical oncology or postoperative surgical visit and asked
to participate in a longitudinal study of the psychosocial
impact of breast cancer and its treatment. Those expressing interest provided informed consent. Participants were
given questionnaires to be completed and returned by
mail within 1 week. Questionnaires included the distress
screening measure, demographics, and additional psychosocial measures. Patients who did not return their questionnaires within 2 weeks received a telephone call to
prompt return of the packet. A semistructured mental
health telephone interview was scheduled within 2 weeks,
and only took place after receipt of screening materials.
During the interview, the purpose of the study was
reviewed and participant questions answered. Interviews
were recorded for reliability purposes. Ethics approval was
granted by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional
Review Board and the Clinical Trials and Scientific Monitoring Committee of the Abramson Cancer Center.
Measures
Demographics

Demographics included age, race, education, marital
status, and household income.
Psychopharmacological treatment

Prescription of psychotropic medication for psychiatric disorder was assessed by interview. We were concerned about patients reporting medications received for
non–mental health reasons (eg, hot flashes, pain), so
patients were asked if they had been ‘‘given a prescription

nerves, drugs, alcohol, or mental health.’’ Medication
names and dosages were reported by direct patient
inspection of available bottles, and medications were
categorized as ‘‘antidepressant,’’ ‘‘anxiolytic,’’ or ‘‘other’’

antidepressant prescriptions were examined.

proportions were constructed using the modified Wald
method.47 Next, patients with a psychiatric diagnosis that
was already being treated pharmacologically were
removed from the sample, and performance characteristics were recalculated to estimate performance for the
untreated patients who would be of greatest interest in
clinical practice. All hypothesis tests were 2-tailed.

Chart abstraction/clinical characteristics

Cancer treatment information, disease staging, diagnosis date, and occurrence of metastases/recurrences were
abstracted from charts by a trained medical abstractor.
Distress screening

The 25-item28 Hopkins Symptom Checklist29
(HSCL-25) was used to screen for psychological distress.
The items of the HSCL-25 either overlap with or have
inconsequential differences from items on various
versions of the Brief Symptom Inventory.30-32 As a group,
this family of instruments is widely used among cancer
patients.33-36 Hough and colleagues28 found that the
HSCL-25 was comparable or superior to the CES-D37 in
detecting psychiatric disorder among general medical
patients. The HSCL-25 has demonstrated reliability.38-40
In the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was
good (0.93).
Psychiatric diagnosis

Diagnoses were obtained using the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV/NP (SCID),41 a semistructured interview based on DSM-IV.42 Modules for current
major depressive disorder (MDD) and lifetime history of
past MDD, dysthymic disorder, and generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD) were administered via telephone by trained
research staff blind to participant responses on questionnaires. Studies have shown good concordance between
telephone and face-to-face diagnostic interviews.43-46 Interrater reliability was assessed on 10% (n ¼ 44) of interviews
for MDD and past MDD diagnoses. Agreement at the
symptom level was high (91%), and reliability was
adequate (kappa ¼ 0.70-0.85).
Primary Data Analysis
Using the standard cut-point of 44 on the HSCL-25, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and
negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for the
presence of MDD and a category combining ‘‘any psychiatric disorder,’’ which included MDD, minor depression,
dysthymia, and GAD. Confidence intervals (CIs) for

RESULTS
Characteristics of Sample
A total of 652 patients were approached to participate,
and 588 consented (90%). Of these, 535 (91%) contributed questionnaire or interview data, and 437 (82%)
contributed both and are included in the current analysis
for an overall participation rate of 67%. Patients contributing both questionnaire and interview data did not
differ from those contributing one but not the other for
presence of any psychiatric disorder, psychotropic
medication, distress, cancer stage, race, income, or marital
status (P ranges .10-.80). Table 1 provides demographic
information for the sample.
Distress, Psychiatric Diagnosis, and
Psychotropic Medication
Overall, psychological distress was moderate (mean 
standard deviation, 40.2  10.7) and significantly
below the cut-point of 44 indicating ‘‘elevated distress’’
(t(436) ¼ 7.3; P<.001). However, 33% of the sample
(95% CI, 28%-37%; n ¼ 142) scored above the established cut-point.
Criteria for current MDD were met in 8% of the
sample (95% CI, 6%-11%; n ¼ 36), whereas 2% (95%
CI, 0.7%-3%; n ¼ 7) met criteria for dysthymia and 3%
(95% CI, 2%-5%; n ¼ 14) met criteria for GAD. Minor
depression research criteria were met in 6% (95% CI,
4%-9%; n ¼ 26). Criteria for at least 1 of these psychiatric
disorders were met by 17% of patients (95% CI,
14%-21%; n ¼ 74). Approximately 20% (95% CI,
16%-24%; n ¼ 87) of patients reported a past history of
MDD on the SCID.
At interview, 36% (n ¼ 158) of patients had a
prescription for a psychotropic medication. Twenty
percent (n ¼ 88) of patients had a prescription for an
antidepressant, 26% had a prescription for an anxiolytic
(n ¼ 112), and 10% (n ¼ 42) had a prescription for both.

Detecting Psychiatric Disorder Through
Screening
Elevated distress on the HSCL-25 related significantly to
2
the presence of current MDD (X(1)
¼ 67.88, P  .001).
This association translated into modest screening efficiency (Table 3). Although only 2 of 36 patients with current MDD were missed, 76% of those who screened
positive did not have MDD (n ¼ 109), and, reflecting the
overall prevalence of MDD in this sample, a patient screening positive would be 3.2 times more likely to not have
MDD than to have MDD. A negative screen, however, was
very efficient in ruling out MDD (NPV ¼ 0.99).
HSCL-25 scores related significantly to the presence
2
of any psychiatric disorder (X(1)
¼ 70.03; P  .001).
However, the HSCL-25 missed 26% (n ¼ 19) of patients
with a current disorder, whereas 24% (n ¼ 88) of patients
with no current disorder screened positive, accounting for
61% of positive screens.

positive, only 6% (n ¼ 7) had MDD that had not already
been identified and treated. (A more conservative
approach would be to exclude as treated those patients
with MDD who were receiving antidepressant medication
only rather than antidepressants or anxiolytics combined,
because antidepressants are the preferred medication for
MDD. Results of analysis using this method are quite
similar to those removing individuals receiving either
2
medication [X(1)
¼ 32.6; P < .001; sensitivity ¼ 0.94;
specificity ¼ 0.72; PPV ¼ 0.12; NPV ¼ 1.0]).
When all patients with treated disorder were
removed from analysis, a positive screen for distress still
significantly predicted presence of any untreated psychiat2
ric disorder (X(1)
¼ 12.68; P < .001). However, a positive
screen for distress missed 44% (n ¼ 12) of untreated psychiatric disorders (n ¼ 27), whereas 24% (n ¼ 88) of
patients without a disorder continued to screen positive,
accounting for 85% of all positive screens.
To examine whether high rates of prescription of
psychotropic medication in this sample reflected potentially appropriate maintenance or prophylactic treatment
of past major depressive disorder, we analyzed data
excluding patients with current treated disorder and/or
past MDD receiving current treatment. For untreated
MDD, results were similar to those given in Table 3
(sensitivity ¼ 0.83; specificity ¼ 0.78; PPV ¼ 0.06;
NPV ¼ 1.0), as were those obtained considering presence
of any untreated disorder (sensitivity ¼ 0.57; specificity ¼
0.79; PPV ¼ 0.13; NPV ¼ 0.97).
Finally, to approximate more closely what would
happen in clinical practice if decisions about screening
were based only on information at hand (eg, whether or
not a patient is receiving treatment), we reanalyzed data
excluding all patients receiving psychotropic medication
regardless of presence of disorder. Results were substan-

sensitivity ¼ 0.57; specificity ¼ 0.80; PPV ¼ 0.23;
NPV ¼ 0.94).

DISCUSSION
When evaluated against a diagnostic interview with no
adjustment for prior identification, the HSCL-25 performed comparably to other instruments.10 A negative
screen was an accurate indicator of the absence of psychiatric disorder. However, the number of true positive cases
was dwarfed by false positives. Moreover, when patients
with a psychiatric disorder that had already been identified and treated were excluded from analyses, the ratio of
true positive identifications relative to false positives was
further reduced. Given that sensitivity varies only slightly
and specificity not at all, this effect largely results from the
lower prevalence rate for untreated patients relative to the
entire sample. That is, removal of treated individuals
reduces the prevalence of disorder from approximately
16% (74/437) to 7% (27/390). Our results raise questions
about the efficiency of routine screening as a means of
identifying psychiatric disorder that would otherwise go
untreated, and point to the need for future studies validating screening instruments to take existing treatment into
account.
The prevalence of distress in our sample was comparable to what is found in other samples.48,49 Prevalence
estimates of MDD or other disorders in past research vary
widely, largely due to methodological differences.50 However, rates that are lower and similar to those in the current
study are obtained when research interviews, rather than
self-report instruments, are used to determine

caseness.49,51,52 An expert consensus statement has concluded that rates of psychiatric disorder among cancer
patients are comparable to those found in other medical
populations, but higher than the general population.53
The high rates of prescription of psychotropic medication were striking and need to be interpreted in the context of escalating rates of prescription in the general
population.54,55 In a previous study of longer-term breast
cancer survivors,7 we found similar prescription rates, but
that sample was heterogeneous with respect to time
because diagnosis and 66% of the sample had been diagnosed 2 or more years previously. The present sample was
less than 2 months from diagnosis, on average. It is, however, unclear whether psychotropic medication had been
prescribed after diagnosis of cancer or before diagnosis.
There are few data concerning prescription of antidepressants in cancer care, but there are suggestions that
rates are high relative to the prevalence of MDD. Ashbury
et al56 found that 19.2% of breast cancer patients received
an antidepressant prescription in the 2 years following
diagnosis, and that prescription correlated to receipt of
pain medication. This likely underestimates prescription,
because Ashbury et al included only those prescriptions
obtained or recorded through oncology services, and
many patients receive prescriptions through primary
care.57 A study of terminally ill cancer patients found that
40% had an antidepressant prescription, although the
prevalence of MDD was only 17%.58 Previous work has
suggested that repeated contact with non-mental health
specialty physicians increases rate of prescription of psychotropic medications, but not necessarily quality of
care.59 Future reports from our dataset will examine type
of provider and changes in prescription rates up to a year
after diagnosis.
Psychotropic prescriptions appeared nonspecific,
and more than one-quarter of patients with neither current nor past psychiatric diagnosis were receiving medication for ‘‘stress, emotions, nerves, drugs, alcohol or mental
health’’ around cancer diagnosis. Another study7 suggested
that nonspecific prescription increases over time, rather
than plateauing. In that study, 48% of long-term breast
cancer survivors with neither current nor past psychiatric
diagnosis received an anxiolytic or antidepressant. Clearly,
there is a need to examine whether this leads to improved
outcomes, though the literature on treatment of subsyndromal depression suggests that this is unlikely.60,61
We found that the proportion of patients with unidentified and untreated psychiatric disorder was considerably less than the proportion of those who were

2740

receiving treatment but remaining syndromal. If replicated, our results may suggest that focusing efforts away
from detecting untreated disorder toward surveillance of
clinical response of already treated patients and using this
information to improve quality of care may be worthwhile. Instruments that have been used for screening have
been used as symptom scales to monitor treatment outcomes,62-64 and there have been demonstrations that
improving consistency and quality of care provided to
already identified patients with MDD would have a larger
impact on a population basis than would increasing the
number of patients introduced to treatment.65 Other data
suggest that among cancer patients, as few as 15% of those
with MDD receive treatment at a therapeutic level.66 The
quality of routine depression care in the community is
generally poor, particularly in general and tertiary nonpsychiatric medical settings,67,68 and there may be particular problems ensuring high quality care within the
competing demands of cancer. In addition, assuming
responsibility for insuring appropriate care of patients
already receiving prescriptions would probably require
different staffing, resources, and relations with prescribing
providers than those currently present in oncology care.
Other data suggest that it may be challenging to
engage patients who have untreated psychiatric disorder
in appropriate treatment. A recent study examining
screening for ‘‘high-risk’’ medical patients69 found that of
the 1687 patients invited for screening, only 71 were identified with MDD, and 36 were already in treatment. Fourteen of the remaining 35 patients refused treatment, and
another 4 did not show up for an appointment. Ultimately,
the number needed to be invited for screening in order for
1 previously unidentified depressed patient to receive treatment was 118. It seems likely that negative attitudes toward
depression treatment are at least partially responsible
for patients having their depression unidentified,18,70 and
will further complicate engaging them in treatment.
This study had the benefit of a high participation
rate, a relatively large sample, and use of a validated psychiatric interview. It is limited by having been conducted
at a single institution with a well-resourced population,
and we cannot evaluate the degree to which results
generalize to lower resourced settings or populations. The
low prevalence of psychiatric disorder led to a small
number of patients with any given disorder, particularly
when examining untreated disorder, though confidence
intervals take this into account. Our results likely underestimate the degree to which psychiatric disorder is already
identified, because we do not have data concerning

nonpharmacologic interventions or whether patients may
have been offered but declined treatments. Therefore, our
estimates of the effects of taking existing treatment into
account should be seen as conservative in that consideration of psychotherapy and other psychosocial interventions would have increased the number of patients
classified as receiving treatment.
We ascertained prescriptions via self-reporting.
Although there are limitations to self-reporting, patients
were asked to have all medication bottles available during
the interview, and we inquired specifically about medications provided for ‘‘problems with stress, emotions,
nerves, drugs, alcohol, or mental health.’’ However, we
lacked systematic data about timing, indications, and
sources of prescriptions, as well as adherence. It remains
possible that some prescriptions were made for off-label
indications. However, our interviews specified prescriptions for mental health–related difficulties, we ignored
prescriptions for non-antidepressant or anxiolytic medications (eg, Zolpidem), and significant relationships
between psychiatric diagnosis and receipt of prescription
suggest that this was not a primary reason for prescriptions. It is possible that some prescriptions were missed
through self-reporting, though rectifying this would likely
strengthen rather than attenuate results. Finally, we did
not take into account nonpharmacological treatment,
treatment refusal, or adherence. Although some psychotherapy for depression is evidence-supported,71 the availability of empirically supported psychotherapeutic
interventions among patients drawn from nonpsychiatric
medical settings is likely to be low.72
In conclusion, our data indicate that screening may
be less efficient as a means of identifying untreated psychiatric disorder among newly diagnosed breast cancer
patients than would be inferred from estimates in the current literature of the efficiency of screening. Given the
high proportion of patients with disorders who are treated
without adequate remission of symptoms, and the difficulties likely to be experienced engaging nonidentified
patients in treatment, screening measures might be better
used as an initial step in monitoring the effectiveness of
ongoing treatment, ruling out disorder,8 or as a prompt
for improving communication surrounding psychosocial
issues rather than a means of identifying individuals with
untreated disorder. Clinicians in cancer care settings,
however, will require significant resources if they are to
effectively coordinate or manage psychiatric care among
patients, in addition to having a willingness to intervene
in existing treatment relationships with other providers.
