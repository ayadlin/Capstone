ABSTRACT
BMI1 is a core component of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and is
up-regulated in biliary tract cancer (BTC), contributing to aggressive clinical features.
In this study we investigated the cytotoxic effects of PTC-209, a recently developed
inhibitor of BMI1, in BTC cells. PTC-209 reduced overall viability in BTC cell lines in
a dose-dependent fashion (0.04 - 20 µM). Treatment with PTC-209 led to slightly
enhanced caspase activity and stop of cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis revealed
that PTC-209 caused cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint. A comprehensive
investigation of expression changes of cell cycle-related genes showed that PTC-209
caused significant down-regulation of cell cycle-promoting genes as well as of genes
that contribute to DNA synthesis initiation and DNA repair, respectively. This was
accompanied by significantly elevated mRNA levels of cell cycle inhibitors. In addition,
PTC-209 reduced sphere formation and, in a cell line-dependent manner, aldehyde
dehydrogease-1 positive cells. We conclude that PTC-209 might be a promising drug
for future in vitro and in vivo studies in BTC.

INTRODUCTION

apoptosis and senescence [1-3]. The core of the PRC1
complex is composed of a BMI, CBX, PHC, RING1
and RYBP subunit, of which RING1 exerts H2AK119ub
activity. BMI is an essential co-factor for RING1 activity
[4, 5]. Aberrant PRC1 activity contributes to cancer
development in various types of tumors [6]. In particular,
BMI1 is up-regulated in cancer and associated with
general aggressiveness and cancer stem cells (CSC) [713].

The polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is
a multi-subunit protein complex that represses gene
transcription by mono-ubiquitylation of histone 2A at
lysine 119 (H2AK119ub) [1]. Originally identified in
Drosophila melanogaster, PRC1 is essential in diverse
biological processes, including embryonic development,
cell cycle progression, DNA repair, stem cells as well as

Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is categorized in
intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(ICC, ECC), as well as gallbladder cancer (GBC) [14].
Although BTC is a rare malignancy in the US and Europe,
mortality rates are very high due to late diagnosis and
limited therapeutic options [15]. Recent studies suggest
that overexpression of BMI1 drives tumorigenesis
and progression of BTC (for a recent review see [5]).
Two publications showed that BMI1 is up-regulated
in BTC cell lines as well as in BTC patient samples
[16, 17]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that
BMI1 is crucial for BTC cells to form colonies – an
attribute associated with CSC [17]. In another study,
immunostaining revealed that BMI1 was highly expressed
in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma and that
BMI1 positivity correlated with enhanced expression
of proliferation markers [18]. High expression levels of
BMI1 were also seen in biliary intraepithelial lesions,
precursors of CC, as well as in invasive CC. Interestingly,
this observation was accompanied by declining levels
of p16INK4A [19]. These data suggest that the PRC1
complex and especially BMI1 promote development and
progression of BTC, making it an interesting therapeutic
target.
Recently, Kreso et al. developed a small-molecule
BMI1 inhibitor called PTC-209 and demonstrated its
specific anti-tumor effects in colorectal cancer in vitro and
in vivo. In particular, they showed that PTC-209 treatment
reduces cancer cell growth and CSC properties [20]. Up
to now, no data is available describing the effects of PTC209 in BTC. Therefore, the current study investigated the
effects of PTC-209 in BTC cells in order to evaluate PTC209 as a potential drug for the treatment of BTC patients.

RESULTS
PRC core components are expressed in BTC cell
lines
The core components of the PRC1 complex BMI1/
BMI1 and RING1B could be detected in all BTC cell lines
at a various extent on mRNA level and/or protein level,
respectively (Figure 1). Correlation analysis of mRNA
and protein expression indicates a significant correlation
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.76, p=0.029) for
these eight cell lines.

(IC10, IC50) see additional file 1). There was no significant
correlation between expression of BMI1/BMI1 and the
effect of PTC-209 on the number of viable cells (IC10,
p=0.8 and p=0.5 for mRNA and protein, respectively).
GBC cells showed a significant response in all, but the
two lowest PTC-209 concentrations and displayed low
IC10 and IC50 values (additional file 1). Therefore, we used
this cell line for all subsequent experiments.
To further analyze the effect of PTC-209 on
proliferation and survival of BTC cells, clonogenic assays
were performed, indicating that treatment of BTC cells
with PTC-209 completely inhibited growth of clones
(Figure 2B for GBC; see additional file 2 for other cell
lines).
To evaluate whether these observations are caused
by either growth arrest or a direct cytotoxic effect (e.g.
apoptosis), we measured caspase activity in PTC-209treated GBC cells. PTC-209 only slightly increased
caspase activity (Figure 2C), indicating that the observed
effects of PTC-209 on cell viability might be not primarily
caused by induction of apoptosis, but rather by a stop of
cellular growth.
To confirm this assumption, we analyzed cell
growth using the resazurin viability assay and observed
that 1.25 µM PTC-209 almost completely stopped cellular
growth of GBC cells (Figure 2D). This observation was
confirmed by an additional experiment in which we
monitored the confluence as a surrogate marker of cellular
growth in real-time by continuous live cell monitoring
over 72 h. After calculation of the cell density for each
picture, the cell growth curves (mean of five independent
experiments) clearly show that PTC-209 impedes cellular
growth (Figure 2E). Interestingly, this effect was already
observable after 24 h of PTC-209 treatment as shown in
Figure 2F (see additional file 3 for a representative video).

threshold, Figure 3C shows that PTC-209 treatment
caused up-regulation of seven and a down-regulation of
24 genes (Figure 3C, for list and results of all 84 genes
see additional file 4). Grouping of these genes shows that
numerous cell cycle-promoting G1-phase genes were
significantly down-regulated, including cyclins CCND1,
CCND3, CCNE1, as well as CDK-2/-4, and TFDP-1/2. These changes were accompanied by a significant
up-regulation of two G1-phase inhibitors (CDKN1A
and CDKN2B). Furthermore, we observed significant
down-regulation of genes responsible for initiation of
DNA synthesis (CDC6, MCM2-5). Additionally, PTC209 reduced mRNA levels of DNA repair genes, such
as BRCA1, MRE11A, and RAD51. In line with these
observations, immunostaining revealed a reduction of
cells positive for proliferation markers Ki-67, CCND1
and pHH3 after PTC-209 treatment (significant for Ki67, CCND1; Figure 3D and 3E). Interestingly PTC-209
caused a significant increase of the cell cycle inhibitor
CDKN1B (Figure 3D and 3E). This factor was also upregulated on mRNA level by trend (fold change 1.7, see
additional file 4) after PTC-209 treatment.

PTC-209 reduces CSC subpopulations
Treatment with PTC-209 caused a significant
reduction of ALDH+ cells from 50% to 20% after 72
h in the GBC cell line (Figure 4A and 4B). It is worth
mentioning that in two out of four experiments, PTC209 completely abolished the ALDH+ subpopulation.
However, this effect seems to be highly cell linedependent, since PTC-209 treatment did not cause
reduction of ALDH+ subpopulation in all eight BTC cell
lines (see additional file 5). We additionally evaluated the
effect of PTC-209 treatment on sphere formation of GBC
cells as a second functional CSC marker. As shown in
Figure 4C and 4D, PTC-209 reduced number and size of
spheres in vitro.

PTC-209 causes cell cycle arrest
We next studied the effect of PTC-209 on the cell
cycle in GBC cells. As shown in Figure 3A, 2.5 µM PTC209 increased cells in sub-G1 (from 25% to 35%) after
72 h of incubation. Additionally, PTC-209 treatment
caused a significant increase of cells in the G0/G1 phase,
accompanied by a significant decrease of cells in the S
phase after 72 h. The percentage of cells in the G2/M
phase remained unchanged (Figure 3A). Time-resolved
analysis of the effects of PTC-209 on the cell cycle (Figure
3B) indicates an increase of cells in the G0/G1 and sub-G1
phases and a decrease of cells in the S phase already 24 h
after treatment.
To further investigate the effect of PTC-209 on
the cell cycle, we performed a comprehensive qRT-PCR
analysis covering changes in the mRNA levels of 84 cell
cycle-related genes following 24 h of PTC-209 treatment.
We considered genes with a fold change of greater than
two as up- or down-regulated, respectively. Using this

PTC-209 decreases protein levels of BMI1 and
H2AK119ub
To evaluate whether the observed effects of PTC209 in GBC cells are caused by an actual reduction of
PRC1 activity we measured mRNA levels of BMI1 and
RING1B and protein levels of BMI1 and H2AK119ub,
respectively, after treatment with PTC-209. Surprisingly,
on mRNA level, treatment of GBC cells with PTC-209
caused an up-regulation BMI1 and RING1B (Figure 5A).
However, western blot analysis revealed a clear decline
of BMI1 protein levels after PTC-209 treatment (Figure
5B and 5C). For H2AK119ub, PTC-209 treatment reduced
protein levels in three out of four experiments (Figure 5B
and 5C).

PTC-209 shows potential synergy with cisplatin

alterations of the BMI1 gene or downstream genes
might explain the non-responsiveness of this cell line.
Since all other seven BTC cell lines used in this study
showed significant responsiveness for PTC-209, future
projects need to investigate the underlying mechanisms
of resistance to identify potential biomarkers for PTC-209
sensitive tumors.
While the anti-cancer effects of PTC-209 were
mediated by cell cycle exit and apoptosis induction in
colorectal tumor-initiating cells [20], the cytotoxic effects
of PTC-209 in the investigated BTC cells were rather
caused by an inhibition of cell growth than apoptosis.
Following PTC-209 treatment, we saw an accumulation of
cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, accompanied by
a significant reduction of cells in the S-phase, indicating
a cell cycle stop at the G1/S checkpoint. Interestingly,
this effect was already observable after 24 h of PTC-209
treatment. This observation goes in line with findings by
Ismail et al., which describe that PRC1 inhibition led to
reduction of ubiquitylated H2A as early as one hour after
treatment [23]. Additionally, immunostaining revealed a
decline of cells positively stained for proliferation markers
Ki-67, pHH3 and CCND1 (significant for Ki-67 and
CCND1), accompanied by a significant increase of the cell
cycle inhibitor CDKN1B.
To provide first information on the mechanism of
action of PTC-209 causing cell cycle stop in BTC cells,
we comprehensively analyzed changes in expression of
cell cycle-related genes after PTC-209 treatment (see
Figure 7 for summary). PTC-209 significantly reduced the
expression of numerous genes that promote cell cycle in

Since treatment with PTC-209 reduced mRNA
levels of genes involved in DNA repair (Figure 3C)
we finally tested if a combination with the standard
chemotherapeutic cisplatin [21] shows a synergistic effect
– based on the mathematical model of Chou T.C. [22].
Although the absolute cytotoxicity values of the combined
drugs are not considerably lower compared to PTC-209
alone, eight combinations of PTC-209 and cisplatin
yielded a combination index (CI) below 0.9 indicating
drug synergy (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
In this study we provide first data on the anti-cancer
effects of PTC-209 in BTC cell lines: i) treatment of eight
different BTC cell lines with various concentrations of
PTC-209 significantly inhibited number of viable cells in
seven cell lines, ii) this effect is mainly mediated by a stop
of cell growth, iii) cell cycle and gene expression analysis
of cell cycle-related genes confirm a cell cycle arrest at
G1/S, iv) PTC-209 may inhibit putative CSC as it reduces
sphere formation and the amount ALDH+ BTC cells (cell
line-dependent), and, v) combined treatment with cisplatin
shows a synergistic effect for several combinations.
For one cell line (EGi-1), the number of viable cells
was not reduced compared to untreated controls. This is
surprising, since EGi-1 showed the highest expression of
BMI1 on mRNA level and also high expression of BMI1
protein. The reasons remain speculative, but genetic

the G1-phase. To our current understanding, the CCND/
CDK4 complex activates E2F-1, which in turn leads to
the transcription of its target genes, including itself, CCNE
and CDC25a. CCNE then associates with CDK2 to control
G1 progression [24]. PTC-209 caused a significant mRNA
up-regulation of the two cell cycle inhibitors CDKN1A
(inhibits CCND/CDK4) and CDKN2B (inhibits CCNE/
CDK2). Additionally, PTC-209 diminished mRNA
levels of TFDP1 and TFDP2, which are known to form
complexes with E2F-1 to enhance its transcriptional
activity [25].

SKP2 has been shown to be important for
progression of the cell cycle in the G1-phase [26, 27] and
PTC-209 treatment caused a significant down-regulation
of SKP2 in our study. Interestingly, a recent publication
has correlated SKP2 expression in extrahepatic CC with
enhanced proliferation and poorer survival and identified
SKP2 as an independent prognostic marker [28]. The same
study also suggests SKP2 as a potential target of E2F-1 – a
gene that was significantly down-regulated after PTC-209
treatment in our study.
An important step for cell cycle progression is the

an additive effect [22]. Synergistic combinations are highlighted

initiation of DNA synthesis. During the G1-phase of the
cell cycle, the assembly of the pre-replication complex
starts by recruitment of CDC6 to the origin of replication
[29]. This allows binding of MCM2-7, a complex of
six highly conserved proteins that ensures proper DNA
replication [29]. When treated with PTC-209, CDC6 as
well as four MCM genes (2-5) were significantly downregulated, suggesting that PTC-209 may inhibit initiation
of DNA replication. Interestingly, a study by Bracken and
coworkers showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of
BMI1 resulted in diminished expression levels of CDC6
[30], making CDC6 a potential BMI1 target. Increased
expression of MCM genes has been found in various types
of cancer and has been associated with short survival rates
[31-33]. In gallbladder cancer, MCM2 has been shown to
serve as an independent predictor of poor outcome, since
expression of MCM2 was correlated with larger tumor
mass, poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and
shorter survival [34].
While insufficient DNA damage repair can lead to
the development of cancer in the first place, DNA damage
repair is one mechanism of cancer cells to develop
therapeutic resistance [21, 35, 36]. Therefore, inhibition
of the DNA repair machinery in cancer cells is a desired
effect, especially when combined with DNA damaging
therapies. Following PTC-209 treatment, we observed
decreased mRNA levels of BRCA1, MRE11A and RAD51,
genes that are involved in homology-directed DNA repair
[36]. One potential underlying mechanism by which PTC209 may inhibit DNA damage repair includes the RAD51
interacting protein RAD51AP [37], which is also known
to be an E2F-1 target [38]. By down-regulation of E2F1, PTC-209 may indirectly also diminish transcription
levels of RAD51AP, which in turn (and combined with
the reduced RAD51 mRNA levels caused by PTC-209

treatment) might impair RAD51 activity. Interestingly,
RAD51AP was related to therapeutic resistance in colon
cancer cells, underlining its importance as a potential
therapeutic target [39]. Concerning BTC, Obama et
al. demonstrated, that RAD51AP was up-regulated in
intrahepatic CC and associated with proliferation, making
it also a potential candidate for BTC treatment [40]. In
this regard we asked the question if treatment with PTC209 can potentially augment chemotherapy in BTC.
Based on the calculation of the combination index (CI)
[22], several combinations of PTC-209 with the standard
chemotherapeutic cisplatin showed a synergistic cytotoxic
effect, making PTC-209 an interesting adjuvant drug for
future more detailed studies using chemoresistant BTC
cells.
In the initial study by Kreso et al., PTC-209
treatment caused apoptosis and cell cycle exit in colorectal
cancer-initiating cells, i.e. CSC [20]. There is strong
evidence that CSC drive tumorigenesis in BTC [41-45].
In the current study we investigated the effect of PTC209 on two functional stem cell characteristics, ALDH
positivity and sphere formation [46-50]: PTC-209 reduced
the ALDH+ subpopulation in four cell lines (GBC, CCSW,
MzChA-2 and TFK-1), whereas in the remaining four
cell lines the ALDH+ subpopulation was not affected or
slightly increased (BDC, EGi-1, MzChA-1 and SkChA-1),
suggesting a strong cell line-dependence. Interestingly,
Shuang et al. demonstrated that the ALDH+ subpopulation
in the BTC cell line TFK-1 had reduced sensitivity to
5-fluorouracil and showed higher proliferation potential.
In patients, expression of ALDH1 was a predictor for poor
prognosis [45]. Additionally, we recently demonstrated
that the ALDH+ subpopulation in BTC cells highly
expresses known stem cell markers compared to ALDH
negative cells [51]. Furthermore, in the present study we

progression by down-regulation of genes involved in DNA synthesis initiation, DNA repair and cell cycle promotion at G1 accompanied by

observed reduced sphere formation of BTC cells in vitro
after PTC-209 treatment, underlining the potential effect
of PTC-209 on CSC characteristics. This goes in line
with Kreso et al., who showed that PTC-209 significantly
diminished sphere-initiating cell frequency in colorectal
cancer samples [20].
While PTC-209 caused an up-regulation of BMI1
on mRNA level, BMI1 protein levels were clearly reduced
after PTC-209 treatment. This phenomenon may be
explainable by an overcompensation reaction of the cells
on the mRNA level. As treatment with PTC-209 resulted
in reduced ubiquitylation of H2AK119 as the effective
histone modification in three out of four experiments, we
conclude that the mechanism of PTC-209 involves BMI1
as a direct target – in agreement with the initial study by
Kreso et al. [20].
In summary, the actual study provides for the first
time evidence for a significant anti-cancer activity of
PTC-209 in BTC cells. In vitro, PTC-209 treatment causes
cell cycle arrest in BTC cells and cell line-dependent
reduction of functional CSC characteristics. The present
data suggests that PTC-209 is a potential anti-cancer agent
for BTC – provided that subsequent future studies yield
conclusive data on its anti-cancer efficiency and possible
side effects in an in vivo BTC model, its bioavailability
in humans and possible mechanisms responsible for drug
sensitivity.

interactions of the drugs with components of the serum.

Drug cytotoxicity
Dose-dependent cytotoxicity of PTC-209 for all
eight BTC cell lines was investigated on cells grown in
96-well microplates. A dilution series of PTC-209 (0.04 20 µM) was applied for 72 h in sfDMEM. Quantification
of cell viability was done using the resazurin assay and
an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan, Groedig,
Austria) as described previously [59, 61]. Viability was
related to untreated control (sfDMEM-only) samples.
For time course experiments, GBC cells were seeded in
96-well microplates and 1.25 µM PTC-209 in sfDMEM
were added. Time points were taken at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h
and 72 h, respectively, and viability was measured using
the resazurin assay and an Infinite M200 microplate
reader. Viability was related to the initial 0 h time point.
Additional time course experiments were carried out
on the JuLi BR live cell movie analyzer (NanoEnTek,
Seoul, Korea). Here, GBC cells were seeded in 30 mm
cell culture dishes and either treated with 1.25 µM PTC in
sfDMEM or left untreated (sfDMEM only). Cell growth
was monitored in parallel on two microscopy units in a
humidified cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) by
taking brigthfield microscopy images every five minutes
for 72 h (865 images per sample). The built-in software
calculated the confluence (% image area) for each image
allowing for continuous monitoring of the cell growth.
For apoptosis analysis, the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany) was used, according
to manufacturer’s protocol in 96-well microplates.
Measurement of caspase-3 and -7 activity was performed
on an Infinite M200 microplate reader. Caspase activity
was related to corresponding control (sfDMEM only)
samples for each time point.

PTC-209 was purchased from Selleckchem
(Houston, Texas, USA), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide

cell lines BDC (G4, [52]), CCSW-1 (G2, [53]), EGi-1 (G3,
[54]), SkChA-1 (G3, [55]), TFK-1 (G2, [56]) and three
gallbladder cancer cell lines GBC (G1, [57]), MzChA-1
(G1, [55]) and MzChA-2 (G2, [55]) were used and termed
together as BTC cell lines [58]. The cells were cultured
in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Gibco, Life Technologies, Vienna, Austria)
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Gibco, Life Technologies) as described before [59, 60].
Cells were seeded using the following concentrations per
cm2 of the cell culture receptacle in 10% FBS DMEM:
3.95*104 (BDC, MzChA-2), 4.74*104 (CCSW-1, GBC),
5.53*104 (SkChA-1), 6.32*104 (EGi-1, TFK-1), and
7.11*104 (MzChA-1). For PTC-209 drug treatment, we
used serum-free DMEM (sfDMEM) to avoid possible

Drug synergy
For combined PTC-209 and cisplatin treatment,
GBC cells were seeded in 96-well microplates and treated
with different concentrations of each drug alone as well
as different combinations of PTC-209 and cisplatin
(single treatments for PTC-209: 5 µM, 2.5 µM, 1.25 µM,
0.63 µM and 0.31 µM; single treatments for cisplatin:
80 µM, 40 µM, 20 µM, 10 µM and 5 µM – see Figure
6A; combinations: 40 µM cisplatin with 2.5, 1.25 or
0.63 µM PTC-209 respectively; 20 µM cisplatin with
2.5, 1.25 or 0.63 µM PTC-209 respectively; 10 µM
cisplatin with 2.5, 1.25 or 0.63 µM PTC-209 respectively
and 5 µM cisplatin with 2.5 or 1.25 µM respectively –
see Figure 6B). To ensure validity of the experiments,
each individual experiment (containing all single and
combination treatments) was performed on one 96-well
microplate. To evaluate a possible synergistic cytotoxic
753

Oncotarget

effect, the combination index (CI) was calculated using the
CompuSyn software (www.combosyn.com) as described
before [22, 62]. Concentrations that resulted in CI values
less than 0.9 were considered as synergistic, whereas CI
values between 0.9 and 1.1 were considered as additive
[22].

stained slides were digitalized using the IMS (version
v14q3, Imagic Bildverarbeitung, Glattbrugg, Switzerland)
and analyzed using Image J (NIH, USA).

Clonogenic assay

Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent
(Ambion / Life Technologies, Vienna, Austria) and the
Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine,
California, USA) followed by cDNA synthesis using the
ImProm-II™ Reverse Transcription System (Promega).
Gene expression was quantified by quantitative real-time
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using GoTaq qPCR
Master Mix (Promega) on a ViiA7 real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). All samples
were measured at least in biological triplicates and checked
for specificity of primer pairs by melting curve analysis.
For calculation, samples were normalized to BETA-ACTIN
as the housekeeping gene. PTC-209-treated samples were
related to untreated controls according to the ΔΔCt method
[63]. Primer sequences for qRT-PCR are as follows: BMI1fwd: ATCCTTCTGCTGATGCTGCCAA, BMI1-rev:
CACCTCCTCCTTAGATTTCTCTTTGTCTT, RING1Bfwd: CTCAGGAGGCAATAACAGATGGCTT, RING1Brev: GACATTCTTTGTTGCCACTTCTAAGGG, BETAACTIN-fwd: GCACTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCC, and
BETA-ACTIN-rev: TCTTTGCGGATGTCCACGTCAC.
Expression changes of cell cycle relevant genes after 24
h of PTC-209 treatment of GBC cells were investigated
with the RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to manufacturer’s protocol and a
ViiA7 real-time PCR system. For data analysis and sample
normalization, Qiagen’s Data Analysis Center was used.
All samples were measured in biological triplicates and
checked for specificity of primer pairs by melting curve
analysis. Samples were normalized to commonly used
housekeeping genes (BETA-ACTIN, B2M, GAPDH,
HPRT1 and RPLP0). Up-regulated genes (fold change
greater than two) are represented as ΔΔCt values related to
untreated controls, down-regulated genes (fold change less
than two) are represented as –(1/fold change) related to
untreated controls according to the Qiagen Data Analysis
Center.

Gene expression analysis

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates using 2000,
1500 and 1000 cells per well for CCSW-1 and TFK1 and 750, 500 and 250 cells per well for BDC, EGi-1,
GBC, MzChA-1, MzChA-2 and SkChA-1. Cells were
left untreated (sfDMEM only) or treated with 1.25 µM
PTC-209 for 7 to 14 days, dependent on the cell line.
Clones were fixed and stained with staining solution (80%
PBS, 20% methanol (Sigma Aldrich), 0.1% crystal violet
(Sigma Aldrich)) for 20 minutes at room temperature,
air-dried overnight and photographed using a Panasonic
DMC-FZ28 camera.

Immunostaining
GBC cells were seeded in 100 mm cell culture
dishes and were either left untreated (sfDMEM only) or
treated with 1.25 µM PTC-209 for 72 h. After harvesting
and resuspension with 200 μl citrate plasma (supplied by
the Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Paracelsus Medical
University, Salzburg, Austria) and coagulation with 200
μl Thromborel® S (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics,
Deerfield, Illinois, USA) the clumped cells were fixed for
1 h in neutral-buffered saline containing 7% formalin and
then paraffin-embedded as described before [60].
Cell blocks were cut into 5 µm sections and
deparaffinized using graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval
was performed by heat-induced epitope retrieval in pH 9
antigen retrieval buffer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at 95°C
for 1 h. Endogenous peroxidase blocking was carried out
for 10 minutes with peroxidase blocking reagent (Dako).
Subsequently, the primary antibodies against Ki-67
(mouse monoclonal, Clone MIB-1, dilution 1:500, Dako),
pHH3 (rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:200, Cell Marque,
Rocklin, California, USA), CCND1 (rabbit monoclonal,
Clone SP4, dilution 1:50, Neomarkers/Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and CDKN1B
(mouse monoclonal, Clone SX53G8, dilution 1:100,
Dako) were applied for 30 minutes at room temperature.
The mouse or rabbit linker (Dako) was used for signal
enhancement. Detection and visualization was performed
using the Envision™ Flex Kit (Dako) based on the
chromogen substrate diaminobenzidine (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin. The immunhistochemical stainings
were done on the Autostainer Plus (Dako) platform. The

Protein analysis
Cells without treatment or after incubation with
1.25 µM PTC-209 (72 h) were harvested by trypsinEDTA treatment and counted. After centrifugation at 400
x g (3 minutes), the cell pellet was resupended in DPBS.
Then cells were sonified (7-10 pulses, Sonopuls HD70,
Bandelin, Berlin, Germany) and incubated for 5 minutes
at 95°C in 2x SDS sample buffer. After that, 105 cells per
sample were loaded on SDS gels (4-20% Mini-PROTEAN
TGX, BioRad, Vienna, Austria). Western blot was

performed with the Trans-Blot Turbo Mini Nitrocellulose
Transfer Packs System (BioRad). Antibodies were used
with the following concentrations: BMI1 (1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA),
H2AK119ub (1:300, Diagenode, Seraing, Belgium),
BETA-ACTIN (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and
anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked (1:1000, Cell Signalling
Technology). Membranes were developed with Signal Fire
ECL Reagent (Cell Signaling Technology) and protein
bands were detected and quantified using a ChemiDoc MP
System (BioRad) and Image J, respectively.

All data points represent mean values of at least
three biological replicates (n ≥ 3) ± SEM. Paired student’s
t-test was used for calculation of significance between
groups. All calculations were performed using OriginPro
9.1 (OriginLab, Northampton, Massachusetts, USA).
Statistical results were considered significant (*) or highly
significant (**) at p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively.
