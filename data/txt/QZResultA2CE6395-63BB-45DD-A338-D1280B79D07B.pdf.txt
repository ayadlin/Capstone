Abstract
Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), a childhood tumor of the tendons and aponeuroses, is uniformly fatal once it has
metastasized because of its profound therapeutic resistance. CCS is characterized by production of a chimeric
transcription factor, EWS-ATF1, which is formed as the result of a disease-specific chromosomal translocation.
EWS-ATF1 activates the melanocyte transcription factor MITF, which in turn activates transcription of c-Met,
an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase recently shown to be activated in CCS. Based on this connection, we
hypothesized that c-Met inhibition may offer a strategy to treat CCS, as an indirect tactic to defeat a transforming pathway downstream of EWS-ATF1. Here, we show that primary CCS and CCS-derived cell lines
express c-Met, which is activated in an autocrine fashion by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter
factor in some CCS cell lines. c-Met expression is critical for CCS invasion, chemotaxis, and survival. Blocking
c-Met activity with a small-molecule inhibitor (SU11274) or a neutralizing antibody to its ligand HGF (AMG 102)
significantly reduced CCS cell growth in culture. Similarly, AMG 102 significantly suppressed in vivo tumor
growth in an autocrine xenograft model of CCS. Collectively, these findings suggest the HGF:c-Met signaling axis
as a candidate therapeutic target to improve clinical management of CCS. Cancer Res; 70(2); 639–45. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically develops in the tendons and aponeuroses of
children and young adults (1, 2). A high rate of local and distant recurrence results in a 5-year overall survival of ∼50%
(3–5). Five-year survival decreases to 20% for metastatic disease, consistent with the profound resistance of the tumor to
conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Molecularly, CCS is characterized by the t(12;22) (q13;12) translocation, which results in fusion of the Ewing's sarcoma gene

EWS with the cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulated transcription
factor ATF1, a member of the cAMP-responsive element
binding protein (CREB) family (6–9). Gene fusion replaces
the kinase-dependent regulatory region of ATF1 with the
amino-terminal domain of EWS. By preserving the DNA
binding and heterodimerization domains of ATF1, this chimera yields an oncoprotein capable of deregulating transcription of CRE-regulated genes (10). We have previously
shown that MITF, the melanocyte master transcription factor, is a direct transcriptional target of EWS-ATF1 (11).
EWS-ATF1 mimics the melanocyte stimulating hormone/
CREB signaling pathway to directly and aberrantly activate
MITF expression.
The MiT family regulates several targets that may be central to oncogenesis. MITF directly activates the c-Met gene
through a conserved E-box element in the c-Met proximal
promoter (12). c-Met is also a transcriptional target of the
ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion, as predicted by the strong homology
between TFE3 and MITF (13).
The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met normally mediates signaling from hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF)
typically expressed by stromal and mesenchymal cells.
c-Met signaling has been implicated in a wide range of biological activities including proliferation, survival, and motility, all of which are frequently dysregulated in cancer. Initially
identified as an oncogene when fused to the nuclear pore
complex protein TPR in carcinogen-treated osteosarcoma
cells (14, 15), c-Met has been implicated in the oncogenesis
of a wide range of cancers including renal, gastric, and smallcell lung carcinomas, central nervous system tumors, as well

as several sarcomas7 (reviewed in refs. 16, 17). In these cancers, c-Met may be aberrantly activated by mutation, autocrine or paracrine HGF stimulation, or overexpression.
Coexpression of HGF and c-Met has been noted in a number
of human tumors, including carcinomas and hematopoietic
malignancies, in addition to certain sarcomas including
CCS (18). Activating c-Met mutations have been shown in familial and sporadic papillary renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, as well as small-cell and non–small-cell lung cancers
(19–24). Mice harboring activating mutations of c-MET spontaneously develop tumors, predominantly sarcomas (25), and

Ink4a/Arf–deficient mice expressing HGF develop rhabdomyosarcoma (26).
In this study, we explored the expression and function of
c-Met in CCS and find that c-Met expression requires
EWS-ATF1 expression. Motility and viability of CCS are dependent on signaling by the HGF/c-Met axis. Inhibition of
the HGF/c-Met axis may constitute a novel biologically directed therapy for these highly metastatic and treatmentrefractory cancers.

bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin. Detection
of EWS-ATF1 expression confirmed the CCS identity of these
cells. HEK293 and HT1080 cells were cultured in RPMI or αMEM supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 10% FBS,
penicillin, and streptomycin, respectively. pLKO.1 expressing
c-Met shRNA (Sigma) was used to prepare vesicular stomatitis virus-G pseudotyped lentivirus by transfection of
HEK293 cells with Transit-LT1 (Mirus) as described (28).
CCS cells were virally transduced as described (11). ATF1-directed ON-TARGETplus siRNA or control nontargeting pool
(Dharmacon) was transfected using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).
Cells were treated with a fully human monoclonal antiHGF antibody (AMG 102, Amgen). SU11274 (Calbiochem)
was dissolved in DMSO and applied to the cells at the concentrations indicated. Control (vehicle)-treated cells were
treated with DMSO only. Viability and proliferation were determined by direct cell counting or WST-1 assay (Roche). For
invasion assays, 5 × 104 cells were plated in serum-free medium in the upper well of an invasion chamber (Matrigel,
BD). Normal growth medium or CCS292-conditioned medium was placed in the lower chamber. After 24 to 48 h, membranes were removed, treated with 1% paraformaldehyde
followed by 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Membranes were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 and
photographed with a Zeiss AxioCam using OpenLab Imaging
software.
Immunoblotting. c-Met expression (C-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and phosphorylation (3126, Cell Signaling Tech-

nology), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
activity (7180 or 5302, Cell Signaling Technology), and
ATF1 expression (25C10G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
monitored by immunoblots as described (12). HGF secretion
was assessed by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Xenograft studies. CCS292 cells (1 × 106) were injected s.c.
into the flanks of forty 4- to 6-wk-old male NCR nude mice
(Charles River). Mice were housed in sterilized cages on a
12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed ad libitum. Groups of 10
mice were treated with 1 mg of AMG 102 or isotype-matched
control antibody (human IgG2) injected i.p. in 100 μL of PBS
twice per week. Tumor volumes were measured twice per
week with digital calipers. Statistical differences were assayed
by repeated measures ANOVA followed by Scheffe post hoc
test. Studies were done under Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
Animal Care and Use Committee protocol 02-030.

Results
To evaluate if c-Met signaling may play a role in CCS, we
analyzed available RNA microarray data derived from primary human CCS (n = 4), a CCS-derived cell line (n = 1), and
other soft tissue sarcomas (n = 47; ref. 18). As a group, mean
expression of both c-Met and HGF was significantly higher in
CCS as compared with other soft tissue sarcomas (Fig. 1A;
P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0225, respectively), although higher
HGF expression is particularly notable in certain CCS samples. Immunohistochemical evidence of c-Met expression in
primary human CCS has been previously reported (29, 30).

Figure 3. AMG 102 inhibits CCS-produced HGF.
A, serum-starved 501mel cells were incubated
with conditioned medium from CCS292 cells
that had been pretreated with AMG 102 or an
isotype-matched control antibody (2, 4, 8, or
16 μg/mL) for 30 min at room temperature.
After 30 min, extracts of cells were made
and immunoblotted for c-Met (MET) and
phospho-c-Met (P-MET). Tubulin serves as a
loading control. B, AMG 102 or isotype-matched
control antibody was added to logarithmically
proliferating CCS292 cells grown in full serum.
After 3 h, cell extracts were immunoblotted for
c-Met and phospho-c-Met by immunoblotting.
Tubulin serves as loading control. Cells were
assayed for phospho-AKT (P-AKT) and
p44/42 extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2
(P-ERK1/2) by immunoblotting. S6 serves as
loading control.

We examined CCS-derived cell lines and found that c-Met
was expressed and phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in
the kinase domain (1234/1235) in two of the three lines during normal growth (data not shown).
To test for direct regulation of c-Met by MITF in CCS cells,
we knocked down MITF expression using lentivirally delivered shRNA and direct siRNA transfection. Despite decreased
MITF expression, c-Met levels were unchanged (data not
shown). We then examined the effect of EWS-ATF1 knockdown using a series of ATF1 siRNAs (Fig. 1B). siRNAs that
recognize the region of ATF1 preserved in the EWS-ATF1 fusion nearly completely eliminated c-Met expression in
CCS292 cells, whereas those that target exclusively wild-type
ATF1 had no effect on c-Met levels (Fig. 1C). All siRNAs
greatly decreased ATF1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
To test the importance of c-Met signaling in CCS, we examined cell viability after inhibiting c-Met expression. Lentivirally expressed c-Met–directed shRNA was transduced
into CCS cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). c-Met–directed
shRNA greatly decreased DTC1 or CCS292 viability but
had no effect on the viability of control HEK293 cells
(Fig. 1D).
We then explored potential mechanisms for c-Met activation. Because activating c-Met mutations have been identified in several cancers, we fully sequenced c-Met exons
encoding the juxtamembrane domain through the tyrosine
kinase domain. No activating mutations were detected in
any of the three CCS cell lines tested. We next tested whether
c-Met activation could be mediated through an autocrine
mechanism. HGF expression was analyzed by ELISA of conditioned media derived from CCS cell lines. CCS292 and
DTC1, but not SU-CCS-1, cells secrete HGF into the media
(Fig. 2A).
HGF is expressed as a single-chain propeptide that requires proteolytic cleavage to generate an active α/β heterodimer (31–33). To test whether HGF produced by the CCS
cells is biologically active, we treated HGF-responsive melanoma cells (501mel) with conditioned media from CCS cells
as well as recombinant HGF. Culture medium derived from
CCS292 robustly activated c-Met in 501mel melanoma cells

642

(Supplementary Fig. S1B and Fig. 3A). Weaker c-MET phosphorylation was noted in 501mel cells after exposure to
DTC1 medium (as compared with CCS292) and likely reflects
the lower levels of HGF produced by DTC1 (Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
Because c-MET has been implicated in cellular motility
and metastasis, we examined CCS cells for their ability to invade and if c-Met may mediate this process. CCS cells
(CCS292 and DTC1) cultured in Matrigel invasion wells
showed a small degree of invasion in the presence of fresh
serum-containing growth medium (Fig. 2B). However, invasion and migration was greatly enhanced when CCS292 conditioned medium (which contains HGF) was placed below
the membrane (Fig. 2B). Inhibition of c-MET expression significantly reduced chemotaxis (Fig. 2C and D).
The simultaneous expression of c-Met and HGF by CCS292
cells and the basal level of phospho-c-Met suggest that c-Met
may be activated through an autocrine pathway. The recent
identification of a fully human monoclonal anti-HGF antibody (AMG 102; ref. 34) offered an opportunity to study
the effect of HGF inhibition on CCS. To show the activity
of AMG 102 on CCS-derived HGF, 501mel cells were treated
with CCS conditioned medium that had been pretreated with
AMG 102. At all concentrations tested, AMG 102 completely
blocked c-Met activation (Fig. 3A). This result confirms that
c-Met activation in this melanoma cell line is mediated exclusively by HGF and not by another secreted factor in the
conditioned medium.
We then tested the effect of HGF inhibition on CCS by
treating CCS292 cells with increasing concentrations of
AMG 102. In contrast to an isotype-matched control antibody (IgG2), AMG 102 resulted in a marked, albeit incomplete, decrease in activated c-Met (Fig. 3B). Decreased
phospho-c-Met was accompanied by an increase in total
c-Met, possibly reflecting a diminished rate of receptor turnover in the absence of continuous, autocrine ligand stimulation. We also examined whether AMG 102–mediated c-Met
inhibition affected intracellular signaling in CCS292 cells.
Both AKT and MAPK signaling were inhibited by AMG 102
treatment in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3B).

Therapeutic Inhibition of c-Met

Small-molecule inhibitors of c-Met provide an alternative
strategy to modulate c-Met. SU11274 is an inhibitor of c-Met
(35–37) with activity in both ligand-dependent and ligandindependent models. Treatment with SU11274 at concentrations reported to inhibit c-Met resulted in a dose-dependent
decrease in phospho-c-Met (Fig. 4A). The inhibition of phospho-c-Met was associated with decreased downstream MAPK
and AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). We then examined cell
proliferation and survival after SU11274 treatment. SU11274
at 1 μmol/L transiently decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 4B).
However, treatment with 10 μmol/L SU11274 resulted in a sustained decrease in cell proliferation and decreased cell viability. The data using either an HGF inhibitor (AMG 102) or a
c-Met kinase inhibitor (SU11274) suggest that c-Met plays a
vital role in a subset of CCS and that its activity plays a dominant role in the stimulation of two pathways (phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAPK) central to cell proliferation and
survival.
Because HGF-stimulated c-Met activation seems to be a
central activator of both survival and proliferation pathways
in CCS, we examined the effect of HGF inhibition on tumor
cell proliferation in culture and in vivo. We cultured CCS cell
lines in the presence of the selective HGF inhibitor AMG 102.
A significant decrease in proliferation was noted in two CCS
lines (Fig. 5A and B). CCS292 cells, which express the most
HGF, showed the most significant difference with weaker
antiproliferative effects in DTC1. The difference in effect on
proliferation correlates with HGF expression (Fig. 2A). For
CCS292, the most appreciable inhibition occurred during
the first few days of treatment with AMG 102. We then examined the effect of HGF/c-Met inhibition on the progression of CCS tumors in mice. Immunocompromised mice
were implanted with CCS292 cells. The effect of AMG 102
treatment was tested using both established tumors and a
minimal disease setting. In the minimal disease setting, treatment with AMG 102 was initiated immediately following
tumor cell implantation, whereas in the established
tumor model, tumors were allowed to develop to a size of
∼250 mm3 before initiating AMG 102 treatment. Mice were

treated twice per week by i.p. injection of AMG 102 or
isotype-matched control antibody, and tumor size was measured. Treatment with AMG 102 resulted in significantly
decreased growth in both tumor models. In the established
tumor model, as a group, tumors in AMG 102–treated mice
were 32% smaller (P < 0.005), whereas in the minimal disease
setting, much more striking tumor growth suppression was
observed (Fig. 5C and D).

Discussion
The search for biologically directed therapies for cancer
depends on the identification of critical cellular targets in
specific tumor types and/or patients. The receptor tyrosine
kinase c-Met has been implicated in a growing number of
diverse cancers and was shown to be a transcriptional target
of the MITF transcription factor in melanocytes (12). We
found that a subset of CCS highly expresses the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, and some of these coexpress its ligand
HGF. We showed that survival/proliferation as well as invasion and chemotaxis are dependent on c-Met signaling in cellular models of CCS. We found that EWS-ATF1, the product
of the pathognomonic translocation associated with CCS, is
required for c-Met expression. However, because MITF is also a transcriptional target of EWS-ATF1, we cannot exclude
the possibility that in conjunction with other putative pathways activated by EWS-ATF1, aberrant MITF expression contributes to c-Met expression. c-Met is activated by autocrine
expression of HGF in some of these tumor cell lines. Significant expression of HGF has also been shown in primary CCS
tumors, although it is unclear whether HGF was expressed by
tumor or stromal cells. The HGF/c-Met axis seems to be a
principal activator of intracellular signaling through both
the MAPK and the AKT pathways. Given the unique importance of c-Met as a potential therapeutic target, we showed
that CCS is a malignancy with susceptibility to c-Met or HGF
inhibition. In the autocrine setting, represented by CCS292,
blocking c-Met or HGF function decreased intracellular signaling, suggesting that c-Met is the primary regulator of

MAPK signaling, even in cells grown in full serum. In vivo,
HGF inhibition significantly decreased tumor development
and growth in both established and minimal disease settings
of CCS.
We examined the tumors that developed despite anti-HGF
antibody treatment and found that c-Met was strongly activated in these tumors (data not shown). This result, taken
together with the xenograft minimal disease finding, suggests
that the antibody most potently inhibits the survival/proliferation of isolated tumor cells or very small tumors. Once the
tumor becomes established, the antibody may be no longer
capable of inhibiting autocrine signaling. It is possible that
the local availability of antibody is insufficient to block the
HGF produced by a growing tumor or that the microenvironment of a larger tumor fosters HGF signaling. However, the
minimal disease model may mimic the scenario faced by
clinicians with a high-risk tumor. After resection of a large
primary tumor in the absence of gross metastatic disease,
microscopic disease often leads to local or distant recurrences, and thus such HGF suppression may exhibit efficacy
in the adjuvant setting. Targeting MITF-activated c-Met in
melanoma could serve a similar therapeutic role (23).
Although it remains to be determined exactly what fraction
of CCS tumors exhibit c-Met activation (by either autocrine or
paracrine mechanisms), knockdown data suggest that the importance of c-Met to CCS may sometimes be independent of
HGF production (i.e., ligand-independent receptor activation;
ref. 38). In addition, other strategies could result in c-Met ac-

644

tivation. For example, in vivo, activation could be mediated
through paracrine mechanisms as seen in other tumor types
(39). Our study suggests the potential for therapeutically targeting HGF/c-Met in CCS. Pathologic interrogation of c-Met
expression and phosphorylation status in human tumors
should permit selection of patients most likely to respond
to HGF/c-Met–directed therapy.
