ABSTRACT
We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine-based therapy as
first-line chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. Randomised controlled trials of
capecitabine monotherapy or combined treatment were included in the meta-analysis.
PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library database and important meeting summaries
were searched systematically. Outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall
survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR) and grades 3–4 drug-related adverse events.
Nine trials with 1798 patients were included. The results indicated a significant
improvement with capecitabine-based chemotherapy compared with capecitabinefree chemotherapy in ORR (relative risk [RR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.03 to 1.26, P = 0.013) and PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.87, P <
0.0001). Overall survival favoured capecitabine-based chemotherapy, but this was not
significant. There were more incidences of neutropenia and neutropenic fever in the
capecitabine-free chemotherapy group and more vomiting, diarrhoea and hand–foot
syndrome in the capecitabine-based chemotherapy group. There were no significant
differences in nausea, fatigue, cardiotoxicity or mucositis/stomatitis between the
two treatment regimens.
Capecitabine-based chemotherapy significantly improves ORR and PFS in patients
with advanced breast cancer, but has no demonstrable impact on OS. Capecitabine-based
regimens are suitable as first-line treatment for patients with advanced breast cancer.

into metastatic breast cancer [1]. It is reported that
advanced breast cancer contributes significantly to
cancer mortality among women. Patients with advanced
breast cancer do not have the option of surgical cure.
Even so, the use of chemotherapy after surgery results
in a significant reduction in systemic recurrence in
patients with isolated loco-regional recurrences [3].
Anthracycline and taxane-based regimens are standard
chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer or metastatic
breast cancer. However, anthracycline-induced cardio­
toxicity limits its application in widespread clinical
practice [4].

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer remains the most common
cancer among women worldwide. Despite significant
improvements in survival outcomes over the past two
decades, breast cancer remains the leading cause of
cancer death in developing countries and the second in
developed countries [1, 2]. The main goals of treatment
of advanced breast cancer are to optimise length and
quality of life. Approximately 16–20% of women with
breast cancer have advanced or metastatic disease, and
50% of early stage breast cancers ultimately develop

Overall response rate

Capecitabine is an oral pro-drug of 5′-deoxy-5fluorouridineat. It shows strong anti-tumour activity
in tumour cells and is well tolerated. Capecitabine
has been approved as combination chemotherapy or
monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally
advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of
anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy [5–7]. A
series of clinical studies demonstrated that capecitabine
improved overall survival and response rates in firstline chemotherapy against advanced breast cancer
[8, 9]. The aim of this current analysis is to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of capecitabine-based chemotherapy
as first-line treatment in advanced breast cancer or
metastatic breast cancer.

Eight trials reported the outcome of ORR and
1692 patients were included in the analysis. The pooled
analysis of ORR showed that there was a significant
improvement with capecitabine-based chemotherapy
compared with capecitabine-free chemotherapy in
the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer
(RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.26, P = 0.013) (Figure 2).
A fixed-effect model was used because no significant
heterogeneity was found between the trials (I2 = 0.0%,
P = 0.435).

Progression-free survival

RESULTS

Data for PFS were available from eight trials. The
pooled HR for PFS demonstrated that capecitabinebased chemotherapy was associated with significantly
longer PFS when compared with capecitabine-free
chemotherapy as first-line treatment for the patients
with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (HR 0.77,
95% CI 0.69 to 0.87, P < 0.0001) (Figure 3). A
random-effects model was used because significant
heterogeneity was found between the trials (I2 = 56.3%,
P = 0.025).

A total of 377 articles related to the analysis were
found from the literature and subjected to the selection
process (Figure 1). Finally, nine randomised controlled
trials with 1798 patients met the inclusion criteria
and were included in the meta-analysis [8, 9, 12–18].
The baseline characteristics of the included studies
are listed in Table 1. Of the nine articles, six were of
capecitabine combination therapy and three were of
capecitabine monotherapy versus other chemotherapy.

respectively). However, there were no statistically
significant differences in nausea, fatigue, cardiotoxicity or
mucositis/stomatitis between the two arms.

Eight trials reported the HR for OS of advanced
or metastatic breast cancer. Capecitabine-based therapy
did not show a significant advantage over capecitabinefree chemotherapy. The pooled HR indicated that there
was no significant difference in OS between the groups
of capecitabine-based chemotherapy and capecitabinefree chemotherapy (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.00,
P = 0.056) (Figure 4). A fixed-effects model was used
because heterogeneity between trials was not significant
(I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.640).

Publication bias
Begg’s and Egger’s tests were used to assess
publication bias. No publication bias was found for
PFS, OS or ORR (P = 0.804, P = 0.804 and P = 0.216,
respectively).

Safety

DISCUSSION

Common drug-related adverse events were reported
in all included trials. The majority were mild (grade 1) or
moderate (grade 2) in severity. The focus of our analysis
is grade 3 or 4 adverse events, which are listed in Table 2.
Incidences of neutropenia and neutropenic fever were
fewer with capecitabine-based chemotherapy compared
with capecitabine-free chemotherapy (RR 0.59, 95% CI
0.39 to 0.89, P = 0.012; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.70,
P < 0.0001, respectively). Incidences of anaemia and
thrombocytopenia were not significantly different between
the two groups. When comparing non-haematological
adverse events, significantly more grade 3–4 vomiting,
diarrhoea and hand–foot syndrome occurred in the
capecitabine-based chemotherapy group (RR 4.47, 95%

Most clinical trials of first-line chemotherapy for
advanced or metastatic breast cancer focus on intensive
regimens. According to current guidelines, anthracyclineand taxane-based regimens are the standard primary
chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic breast cancer
[19, 20]. However, intensive regimes maybe unsuitable
for older women or patients who have significant
complications. Capecitabine-based chemotherapy used as a
treatment strategy in patients pre-treated with anthracycline
or taxanes in general. According the guidelines of
the European School of Oncology and the European
Society for Medical Oncology (ESO-ESMO) 2014 [4],
capecitabine was recommended as an option for the firstline treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Our study’s pooled analysis indicates that
capecitabine-based chemotherapy is significantly superior
to capecitabine-free chemotherapy in terms of ORR and
PFS, but that OS is similar between the two groups.
This meta-analysis summarises the current randomised
controlled trial evidence of the potential benefit of
capecitabine-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment
for the patients with advanced or metastatic breast
cancer. The effects could be explained by capecitabine’s
synergistic effect with cytotoxic drugs through increased
thymidine phosphorylase levels in tumours [20].
Most of the trials included in this review used a dose
of capecitabine of 1,000 mg/m2 twice daily (on days 1–14
of a 3-week cycle), which is lower than that approved
by the USA Food and Drug Administration (1,250 mg/
m2 twice daily). This lower dose has been shown to lead
to better tolerability of the drug without compromising
its efficacy [21]. Lower haematological toxicity and
higher gastrointestinal toxicity were seen in patients
receiving capecitabine-based chemotherapy. It is worth
noting that the rate of hand–foot syndrome toxicity was
significantly higher in the capecitabine-based group. In the
OMEGA study involving female patients aged ≥ 65 years,
capecitabine showed acceptable tolerance as first-line
chemotherapy, even in vulnerable patients and those aged
≥ 75 years [22]. A number of studies are also investigated
novel dosing schedules of capecitabine. A 4-week schedule
(days 1–21, every 28 days) of capecitabine-based therapy
is widely used in Japan, and the ‘7/7′ regimen (7 days
of therapy followed by 7 days of rest) is common in the
United States [23–25] . Study has shown that apecitabinebased patients were significantly more likely to continue
therapy beyond 6 months and 12 months than classical
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF
regimen) patients [26].
Approximately 20% of patients with metastatic
breast cancer have human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive tumours. These patients
typically have a poor prognosis, with shortened PFS
and OS usually [17, 27]. Trastuzumab combined with
docetaxel is a standard first-line chemotherapy regime
for HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer. One trial
included in this meta-analysis compared capecitabine
plus trastuzumab and docetaxel with docetaxel plus
trastuzumab in HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer.
A high ORR was observed between both treatment
groups and PFS was significantly longer in the
capecitabine-based arm [17]. Another trial demonstrated
that capecitabine combined with trastuzumab improved
time to progression and ORR significantly when
compared with capecitabine monotherapy in patients
with progression after trastuzumab-based therapy [28].
Therefore capecitabine combination therapy may be a
useful treatment option for patients with HER-2 positive
metastatic breast cancer, although more evidence is
needed.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Several limitations need to be considered when
interpreting our analysis. First, all trials except one [16]
involved patients with HER-2 negative tumours. We
were not able to do a subgroup analysis by HER-2 status
because of the lack of sufficient data. Second, the control
regimens varied widely between included trials and this
may have influenced the results. Third, the sample size is
relatively small. A study with a large sample size is needed
in the future to better understand the role of capecitabinebased regimens in the first-line treatment of advanced
breast cancer.
In summary, this analysis indicates that capecitabinebased regimens produce superior ORRs and prolong
the PFS of patients with advanced or metastatic breast
cancer. In addition, it has been shown that tolerability
can be improved through adjusting the dosing regimen of
capecitabine. Therefore, capecitabine-based chemotherapy
could be a preferable option as first-line therapy for
patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Further
research is necessary to confirm these findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy
Two investigators (YWJ and PGSH) independently
carried out a systematic search from January 1998 to
May 2015, using PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane
Library database. We also reviewed the meeting abstracts
of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
for the last 10 years. Searches were limited to human
clinical trials published in English. The key words were
capecitabine, Xeloda, breast cancer, breast neoplasm and
first-line.

Selection criteria
Eligible studies had to meet the following inclusion
criteria: randomised controlled trials involving patients
with advanced or metastatic breast cancer; studies
comparing capecitabine-based chemotherapy versus other
chemotherapy as first-line treatment.

Data extraction
Two investigators (YWJ and GSG) extracted data
independently, using a prepared information form. Any
disagreement was discussed and resolved by consensus
in a meeting with a third investigator. The following data
were extracted from included studies: authors, publication
year, study phase, number of intention-to-treat patients,
treatment regimens, randomisation method, and the results
of ORR, PFS, OS and adverse events. We contacted the
corresponding authors to obtain additional information
that was not reported in the articles. The quality of the

randomised controlled trials included in the meta-analysis
was evaluated using the Jadad scoring system using the
measures of method of randomisation, double-blinding
procedure, method of allocation concealment, and
withdrawals [10].

Statistical analysis
The analysis was carried out using Stata 12.0
software, on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated
the HR for PFS and OS. The relative risk was used to
calculate the ORRs and grade 3 and 4 drug-related
adverse events. The HRs and their 95% CIs were obtained
from the articles directly, and we extracted data from
the Kaplan-Meier survival curve as reported by Parmar
et al. [11] if the value was not given in the article. The
heterogeneity of study outcomes was assessed by the
χ2 test or I2 statistics. Heterogeneity was considered
statistically significant when the P value was < 0.05 or
I2 was > 50%. If significant heterogeneity existed, data
was analysed using a random-effects model; otherwise, a
fixed-effects model was used.
