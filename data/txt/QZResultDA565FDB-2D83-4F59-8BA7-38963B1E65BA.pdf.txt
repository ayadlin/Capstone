ABSTRACT
Here, we found that ING5 overexpression increased autophagy, differentiation,
and decreased proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and lamellipodia formation
in gastric cancer cells, while ING5 knockdown had the opposite effects. In SGC-7901
transfectants, ING5 overexpression caused G1 arrest, which was positively associated
with 14-3-3 overexpression, Cdk4 and c-jun hypoexpression. The induction of Bax
hypoexpression, Bcl-2, survivin, 14-3-3, PI3K, p-Akt and p70S6K overexpression by
ING5 decreased apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. The hypoexpression of MMP-9, MAP1B
and flotillin 2 contributed to the inhibitory effects of ING5 on migration and invasion
of SGC-7901 cells. ING5 overexpression might activate both β-catenin and NF-κB
pathways in SGC-7901 cells, and promote the expression of down-stream genes
(c-myc, VEGF, Cyclin D1, survivin, and interleukins). Compared with the control,
ING5 transfectants displayed drug resistance to triciribine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, SAHA,
MG132 and parthenolide, which was positively related to their apoptotic induction
and the overexpression of chemoresistance-related genes (MDR1, GRP78, GRP94,
IRE, CD147, FBXW7, TOP1, TOP2, MLH1, MRP1, BRCP1 and GST-π). ING5 expression
was higher in gastric cancer than matched mucosa. It was inversely associated with
tumor size, dedifferentiation, lymph node metastasis and clinicopathological staging
of cancer. ING5 overexpression suppressed growth, blood supply and lung metastasis
of SGC-7901 cells by inhibiting proliferation, enhancing autophagy and apoptosis in
xenograft models. It was suggested that ING5 expression might be employed as a
good marker for gastric carcinogenesis and subsequent progression by inhibiting
proliferation, growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. ING5 might induce apoptotic
and chemotherapeutic resistances of gastric cancer cells by activating β-catenin, NFκB and Akt pathways.

INTRODUCTION

functions as Class II TSG due to a suppressive role in
initiation, promotion and development of tumors [2].
ING5 consists of several different domains, among which
LZL (leucine zipper like) has been shown to promote
DNA repair, apoptosis and chromatin remodeling, NLS
(nuclear localization signal) to guide nuclear translocation,

Loss (Class I) and inactivation (Class II) of tumor
suppressor genes (TSG) result from chromosomal
deletion, mutation or hypermethylation and in immortality
of cancer cells [1]. The inhibitor of growth (ING) 5

and NCR (novel conserved region) to remodel chromatin.
ING5 can interact with histone acetyl transferase (HAT)
complexes (H4-HBO1-JADE-ING5 and H3-MOZMORF-BRPF-ING5) [3, 4]. H4-HBO1–JADE–ING5 HAT
complex might enhance DNA replication in cooperation
with the mini-chromosome maintenance complex because
ING5 knockdown abolishes DNA synthesis and ING5
overexpression decreases S-phase cells [5, 6]. ING5
transcriptionally induces the expression of p21/waf1
and interacts with Cyclin A1 inhibitor to suppress cell
cycle progression [7, 8]. Liu et al. [8] reported that ING5
assisted Tip60 in acetylating p53 at K120 in response to
DNA damage by a complex formation with p53 and Tip60.
The acetylated ING5 subsequently bound to the promoters
of its target apoptotic genes, Bax and GADD45.
ING5 deletion, mutation and down-regulation were
detectable in oral carcinogenesis [9, 10]. The reduction in
nuclear ING5 expression and its cytoplasmic translocation
were observed in head and neck squamous cell cancer
(HNSCC) [11], and positively linked to tumorigenesis
and aggressive behaviors of colorectal or gastric cancers
[12, 13]. In the present study, we observed the in vivo and
vitro effects of altered ING5 expression on proliferation,

apoptosis, autophagy, differentiation, invasion, migration,
metastasis and chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells,
and analyzed the relevant molecular mechanisms. ING5
expression was also compared with carcinogenesis and
aggressive behaviors of gastric cancer.

RESULTS
ING5 expression in gastric cancer cells
ING5 mRNA was strongly expressed in GES-1,
AGS, GT-3 TKB, HGC-27, MKN28, but weakly in BGC823, KATO-III, MGC-803, MKN45, SCH, SGC-7901,
and STKM-2 (Figure 1A). Western blot showed ING5
overexpression in the nuclei of GES-1, AGS, BGC-823,
GT-3 TKB, MGC-803, SCH and SGC-7901, but weak in
HGC-27, KATO-III, MKN-28, MKN-45, and STKM-2
(Figure 1B). Transient transfection indicated that GFPfused ING5 was localized in the nuclei of GES-1, AGS,
GT-3TKB, HGC-27, KATO-III, MGC-803, MKN28,
MKN45 and SGC-7901 (Figure 1C and Figure 2A).

ING5 knockdown could enhance proliferation, cell
cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, invasion and
lamellipodia formation (Figure 3D-3I, p < 0.05). IdU and
CIdU staining showed a low ratio of S-phase cells in GT3TKB transfectants (Figure 3J).

After transfected with pEGFP-N1-ING5, SGC7901 cells overexpressed ING5 at both mRNA and protein
levels (Figure 2A-2C). The high karyoplasmic ratio, slow
growth and G1 arrest were seen in ING5 transfectants,
compared with the control (Figure 2D-2F, p < 0.05).
There was a lower apoptosis evidenced by Annexin-V
(Figure 2G, p < 0.05), a higher mitochondrial membrane
potential by JC-1 staining (Figure 2H, p < 0.05) and a
better differentiation by tight junction (Figure 2I) and
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (Figure 2J, p < 0.05)
in SGC-7901 transfectants than the control. SGC-7901
transfectants showed more autophasomes (Figure 2I)
and stronger punctate LC3B-EGFP (Figure 2K) than the
control. ING5 overexpression could suppress migration
and invasion by transwell chamber assay (Figure 2L, p
< 0.05 ) or wound healing (Figure 2M, p < 0.05), and
weaken lamellipodia formation, labeled with F-actin
staining (Figure 2N) in comparison to the control or mock.
ING5 transfectants showed lower DNA replication than
SGC-7901 by IdU and CIdU staining (Figure 2O).
As shown in Figure 2P, ING5 transfectants displayed
the overexpression of Cyclin E, cdc2, Bcl-2, Bax, 14-3-3,
Raptor, mTOR, Akt2 and Akt3, compared with the control
and mock by real-time PCR (p < 0.05). At the protein level
(Figure 2Q and 2R), ING5 overexpression increased the
expression of Cyclin E, Cyclin B1, cdc-2, p-cdc2 p34,
cdc25B, Bcl-2, AIF, XIAP, c-myc, Beclin 1, p-Akt1/2/3,

ING5 overexpression activated β-catenin and NFκB pathway in gastric cancer cells
The mRNA and protein expression of β-catenin
was increased in SGC-7901 transfectants, compared with
the control and mock (Figure 4A and 4B, p < 0.05). Dual
luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that both TCF4 promoter activity and TCF4-mediated gene transcription
activity became higher in SGC-7901 transfectants than the
control (Figure 4C and 4D, p < 0.05). It was the same for
the down-stream target genes, such as c-myc, Cyclin D1,
survivin and VEGF (Figure 4F, p < 0.05). Additionally,
promoter activity and expression level of NF-κB were
higher in SGC-7901 transfectants than the control or mock
(Figure 4A, 4B and 4E, p < 0.05). It was the same for
the mRNA expression of its down-stream target genes,
including IL-1, -2, -4, -10, and -17 (Figure 4F, p < 0.05).

After transfection of pEGFP-N1-ING5, ING5 expression became strong in SGC-7901 cells by morphological examination (green: GFPfused ING5), RT-PCR and Western blot (A-C). The transfectants showed a high karyoplasmic ratio (D), low growth (E), and G1 arrest (F)
in comparison to the control. An apoptosis-resistance and a low mitochondrial potential was detected in ING5 transfectants in comparison
to the maternal cells, evidenced by Annexin V assay (G) and JC-1 staining (H). There was a better differentiation in ING5 transfectants than
the control according to the tight junction of TEM (blue arrows, I) and ALP activity (J). The higher autophagy was detectable in SGC-7901
transfectants than the maternal cells, evidenced by autophasome of transmission electron microscope (red arrows) and punctate LC3BEGFP (K). Compared with the control, ING5-overexpressing SGC-7901 had a weak ability to migrate and invade by transwell chamber
assay (L) and wound healing (M), and showed a weak lamellipodia formation, labeled with F-actin immunostaining (N). There were a
lower proportion of S-phase cells in SGC-7901 transfectants than the control by IdU and CIdU staining (O). The phenotype-related genes

DISCUSSION

Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, and inhibiting apoptosis [19]. XIAP
might function as apoptotic inhibitor by binding to and
suppressing caspase activation [20]. Our investigation
indicated that lower expression Bax, higher expression of
Bcl-2, survivin and 14-3-3 induced apoptotic inhibition
of ING5 via mitochondrial pathway. Reportedly, Akt1
inactivates Caspase 9 by phosphorylation on ser196. After
phosphorylation by Akt1, BAD is released from Bcl-2 or
Bcl-xL and loses its pro-apoptotic effect [21]. The high
level of phosphoralyted Akt in ING5 transfectants might
be responsible for the apoptotic inhibition.
Wnt signaling pathway can inhibit GSK-3-mediated
phosphorylation of β-catenin allowing β-catenin to the
nucleus, where the interaction of β-catenin with TCF
family transcription factors regulates gene expression
[22]. Here, ectopic ING5 expression was found to enhance
the mRNA and protein expression of β-catenin in SGC7901, as well as its phosphorylation. It was true for
β-catenin- targeting TCF-4 promoter and TCF-mediated
gene transcription, such as, c-myc, VEGF, survivin and
Cyclin D1 [23]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that ING5
overexpression activates the β-catenin pathway, finally
to up-regulate the mRNA expression of target genes via
TCF-4 transcriptional factor.
Although autophagy is a process of sequestering
cellular cytosol and intracellular organelles into
autophagosome, and phagocystosis is engaged in
sequestering cellular exterior, both events are capture and
digestion of material and display similar morphological
appearances [24]. The top canonical pathways included
phagosome and cell adhesion molecules in ING5
transfectants. Reportedly, cell adhesion molecules,
like E-cadherin, are delivered via secretory vesicles
as cargo to sites of polarity and involved in exocytosis
[25], consistent with our results. During autophagy,
mTOR kinase signaling pathway positively regulates
the formation of ATG13-ULK1-RB1CC1 complex.
Subsequently, autophagosome formation is induced by III
PI3K, Beclin-1 and ATG-14, finally to promote ATG12ATG7 conjugation [26]. Here, it was found that ING5
overexpression in vivo and vitro induced the autophagy of
SGC-7901 cells with Beclin 1 overexpression, indicating
that ING5-induced autophagy was dependent on beclin-1
and belonged to canonical pathway.
The chemoresistance of ING5 transfectants to
triciribine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, SAHA, MG132 and
parthenolide was positively correlated with their apoptotic
induction. Particularly, the up-regulated expression of drug
resistance genes might contribute to ING-5-mediated
chemoresistance, including MDR1, GRP78, GRP94,
IRE, CD147, FBXW7, TOP1, TOP2, MLH1, MRP1,
BRCP1, and GST-π [27-31]. Akt/PI3K/p70S6K pathway
is reported to promote cellular survival and inhibits
apoptotic processes [32]. In addition, novel PKC δ and ζ
are activated through DAG, and suppress apoptosis [33].
The overexpression of PI3K, p-Akt, p70S6K and nPKC in

The hypoexpression of nuclear ING5 protein
and its cytoplasmic translocation were observed in oral
squamous cancer [10], HNSCC [11], colorectal [12] and
gastric [13] cancers. However, ING5 overexpression
was found in gastric cancer in comparison to matched
mucosa by Western blot, which might be attributable to
its nucleocytoplasmic translocation from NLS mutation,
ING5 expression in stromal cells and a high karyoplasmic
ratio of cancer cells. The pEGFP-N1-ING5 transfection
and nucleocytoplasmic fraction demonstrated that ING5
protein was localized in the nuclei of gastric cancer or
epithelial cells, indicating that the translocating system
of ING5 protein works well in the cells. In line with
immunohistochemical findings of nuclear ING5 [12], we
found that ING5 expression level was negatively linked to
tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and clinicopathological
staging, indicating that ING5 protein mainly reflected
its nuclear product and might be employed to indicate
the aggressiveness of gastric cancers [13]. ING5
overexpression was in vitro found to decrease migration,
invasion and lamellipodia formation with MMP-9
hypoexpression, and in vivo suppressed lung metastasis
of gastric cancer cells, suggesting that ING5 might inhibit
invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by reducing
MMP-9 expression. Moreover, ING5 overexpression was
demonstrated to cause the differentiation of SGC-7901
cells evidenced by enhanced ALP activity and remarkable
tight junctions, supporting a higher expression of ING5
protein in intestinal- than diffuse-type carcinomas by
Western blot and immunohistochemistry [13].
There in vivo and vitro appeared a low proliferation
in SGC-7901 transfecants in comparison to the control.
Reportedly, Cyclin E and D1 activate Cdks and induce
the transition between G1 and S phase [14]. c-jun is
required for progression through the G1 phase, and c-jun
null cells show increased G1 arrest [15]. Cyclin B1-Cdk1
is involved in the early events of mitosis, and CDC25B
activates the cyclin dependent kinase CDC2 for entry
into mitosis [16]. It is believed that 14-3-3 sequesters
Cdc25C to the cytoplasm to prevent the interactions with
Cyclin B-Cdk1 necessary for G2/M transition [17]. In
SGC-7901 transfectants, ectopic ING5 expression caused
G1 phase arrest, which was positively linked to 14-3-3
overexpression, Cdk4 and c-jun hypoexpression. The
stronger expression of cdc-2, Cyclin B1 and cdc25B might
be compensatory for the low proportion of G2-phase cells.
Interestingly, ING5 overexpression could suppress
the apoptosis of SGC-7901 by increasing mitochondrial
membrane potential. In apoptosis, Bcl-2 can interact
with Bax on the mitochondrial membrane to suppress
the apoptosis because Bax is believed to open the
mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel for
apoptosis [18]. Phosphorylated BAD can be complexed
by 14-3-3 protein, preventing the association of BAD with

ING-5-overexpressing SGC-7901 demonstrated that Akt/
PI3K/p70S6K activation and nPKC overexpression might
enhance the apoptotic and chemotherapeutic resistance of
gastric cancer cells.
NF-κB is a protein complex that controls
transcription (e.g. cytokines) and protects cancer cells
from apoptosis [34]. Here, ING5 overexpression was
found to activate NF- κB pathway by upregulating its
transcriptional activity and expression, indicating that NFκB might have impact on ING5-mediated drug resistance.
It was documented that specificity protein 1(Sp1) and
Stat5a/b belong to transcription factor and mediate the
signals of cytokines [35, 36]. In SGC-7901 transfectants,
overexpression of NF-κB, Sp-1 and stat5a/b might be
responsible for the higher expression of ILs. In proteomic
analysis, up-regulated genes belong to MAPK, NF-κB,
histone and cholesterol metabolism (APO1), among which
the former two are positively linked to the osteoclast
differentiation. In addition, the down- regulated genes
are involved in the cell division cycle and apoptosis (e.g.
CCAR), chemical modification of RNA (e.g. CARS and
SNORD19B) and mobility (e.g. PACSIN3, MAP1B and
FLOT2). Therefore, ING5 overexpression induced cell
cycle arrest, apoptotic resistance, and suppressed invasion
and migration as observed in our data.
In conclusion, ING5 overexpression might
suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion, induce
autophagy and differentiation, and mediate apoptotic and
chemotherapeutic resistance of gastric cancer cells. ING5
overexpression might activate β-catenin, NF-κB and Akt
pathways in gastric cancer. Therefore, it has to be careful
to employ ING5 as a target of gene therapy for gastric
cancer.

NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents
(Pierce).

Plasmid construction and transfection
Plasmid pCDNA3.1-ING5 (kindly presented
by Prof. Côté) was used to construct of the COOHterminally GFP-tagged ING5 plasmid (pEGFP- N1ING5). The amplified ING5 DNA was digested and
inserted into pEGFP- N1 (Clontech, USA) between
BamH I and Hind III. SGC-7901 cells were transfected
with pEGFP-N1-ING5, pEGFP-N1 vector or pEGFPN1-LC-3B at 24 h after seeding on dishes, or selected
by G418. siRNAs were also transfected to silence ING5
expression in GT-3TKB. The target sequences of ING5
were 3’-GAAAAGAGGAAGAAGAAGT-5’ (sense) and
3’-ACTTCTT CTTCCTCTTTTC-5’ (anti-sense).

Proliferation assay
Cell Counting Kit-8 was employed to determine
the number of viable cells. In brief, 2.5 × 103 cells/well
were seeded on 96-well plate and allowed to adhere. At
different time points, 10 μL of CCK-8 solution was added
into each well of the plate and the plates were incubated
for 3 h in the incubator, and then measured at 450 nm.

Cell cycle analysis
1 × 106 cells were collected, washed by PBS twice
and fixed in cold 10mL 75% ethanol for more than 2 h.
And then, cells were washed by PBS and incubated with
RNase at 37°C for 1 h. The tube with cells was added
by PI to 50 µg/mL and incubated at 4°C in the dark for
30 min. Finally, FACS was employed to examine the PI
signal.

Apoptosis assay by flow cytometry

Immunofluorescence

Flow cytometry was performed with 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) and phycoerythrin (PE)labeled Annexin V (BD Pharmingen, USA) to detect
phosphatidylserine externalization as an endpoint indicator
of apoptosis as the protocol recommends.

Cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed twice
with PBS, fixed with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde
for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
in PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were
incubated overnight at 4 oC with the antibody against
ING5 (Proteintech) or LC-3B (Cell Signal). They were
then washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor
488 IgG (Invitrogen). Alexa Fluor® 568 phalloidin
(invitrogen) was employed to observe the lamellipodia.
Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma). Finally,
coverslips were mounted with SlowFade® Gold reagent
(invitrogen) and observed under laser confocal scanning
microscope.

Wound healing assay
Cells were seeded at 1.0×106 cells/well in 6-well
culture plates. After they had grown to confluence, the
cell monolayer was scraped with a pipette tip to create
a scratch, washed by PBS for three times and cultured in
the FBS-free medium. Cells were photographed and the
scratch area was measured using Image software.

Luciferase reporter assay

Cell migration and invasion assays

To evaluate the β-catenin/TCF-4 and NF-κB
transcriptional activity, we transiently co-transfected TCF4 promoter reporter gene plasmid, pGL-[1306]TCF4-Luc,
or TCF-mediated transcription reporter gene plasmid,
pGL3-OT and pGL3-OF, using Lipofectamine 2000.
Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection
using dual-luciferase reporter assay system. The Renilla
luciferase activity was used as an internal control. TCFmediated gene transcription activity was determined by the
ratio of pGL3-OT to pGL3-OF luciferase activity, which
was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity of pRL-TK.
TCF-4 and NF-κB promoter activity was determined by
the value of pGL-[1306]. TCF4-Luc and NF-κB luciferase
activity, which was also normalized by Renilla luciferase
activity of pRL-TK.

For migration assay, 2.5 × 105 cells were
resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640, and seeded in the
control-membrane insert on the top portion of the chamber
(BD Bioscience). The lower compartment of the chamber
contained 10% FBS as a chemo-attractant. After incubated
for 24 h, cells on the membrane were scrubbed, washed
with PBS and fixed in 100% methanol and stained with
Giemsa dye. For invasive assay, the procedures were the
same as above excluding the matrigel-coated insert (BD
Bioscience).

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
ALP activity was used as a marker of colorectal
differentiation. The cells were harvested, broken and
subjected to the determination of ALP activity using
Diagnostics ALP reagent (Sigma, USA). The protein
content of the samples was determined Biorad protein
assay kit (Biorad, USA). ALP activity was calculated as
U per g of protein.

Proteomic analysis by iTRAQ labeling and 2D
Nano-LC-MS/MS
For iTRAQ analysis, the protein samples were
extracted from SGC-7901 and its ING5 transfectants
(Clone 8) in RIPA lysis buffer containing cocktail protease
inhibitors (Roche). Two hundred micrograms of each
sample were digested and labeled with the following
iTRAQ labels. Samples were separated by strong cation
exchange and sequentially analyzed by two-dimensional
LC-MS/MS. Data were acquired under the informationdependent acquisition mode, with dynamic exclusion set
to exclude any m/z values that had been picked for MS/
MS scan. The bioinformatics analysis of the differentially
expressed proteins was performed with Ingenuity
Pathways Analysis (IPA) software (version 6.3, Ingenuity
Systems, Redwood City, CA; http://www.ingenuity. com).
Details are provided in the Supporting Information.

Transmission electron microscopy
Specimens were immersed in 2% cacodylatebuffered glutaraldehyde for 6 h. They were then rinsed in
cacodylate buffer supplemented with 15% sucrose, postfixed with 1% phosphate-buffered OsO4 (pH 7.4) for 2
h, dehydrated with alcohol, clarified in propylene oxide,
and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were made
with ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate, followed
by a saturated solution of bismuth subnitrate and finally
examined under a JEOL 1010 electron microscope.

curves were generated by quantitative analysis performed
in a region of interest using the software Pulse.

Gastric cancers and matched mucosa were collected
from the First Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning Medical
University (China) between 2012 and 2013 and frozen in
-80°C until protein and RNA extraction. The patients with
gastric cancer were 23 men and 13 women (34-81years,
mean=56.9years). None of the patients underwent
chemotherapy, radiotherapy or adjuvant before surgery.
They all provided written consent for use of tumor tissue
for clinical research and our University Ethical Committee
approved the research protocol. TNM staging for gastric
cancer was evaluated according to Union Internationale
Contre le Cancer system. Histological architecture
of gastric cancer was expressed in terms of Lauren’s
classification.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from gastric cancer and
epithelial cell lines using QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit
(Germany). Total RNA were subjected to cDNA synthesis
using AMV reverse transcriptase and random primer
(Takara). General and real-time RT-PCR amplification
was performed using Hotstart Taq polymerase (Takara)
and SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II kit (Takara) respectively.
According to the Genbank, oligonucleotide primers were
designed and shown in supplementary Table 1.

Xenograft models

Western blot

Locally bred BALB/c nude mice were maintained
under SPF condition, and food and water were supplied
ad libitum. All procedures involving animals were
performed in compliance with the Committee for Animal
Experiments guidelines on animal welfare of Liaoning
Medical University. Subcutaneous xenografts were
established by injection of 1× 10 6 cancer cells per mouse
at the age of 6–8 week (n=10/group). Tail vein assay of
cancer metastasis was performed by intravenous injection
of 1× 106 cancer cells (n=5/group). Tumor volume was
measured using calipers, and calculated as follows:
length × width × depth × 0.52. After 2 to 3 weeks of postinjection, we euthanized mice by CO2 asphyxiation and
removed tumors and lungs, rinsed in tap water, and fixed
in 4% formaldehyde.

Protein assay were performed using Biorad protein
assay kit. The denatured protein was separated on SDSpolyacrylamide gel and transferred to Hybond membrane,
which was then blocked overnight in 5% milk in TBST.
For immunoblotting, the membrane was incubated with
the primary antibody (Supplement Table 2). Then, it was
rinsed by TBST and incubated with IgG-conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). Bands were visualized
by ECL-Plus detection reagents (Santa cruz). The
densitometric quantification was performed with a β-actin
control using Scion Image software.

Terminal digoxigenin-labeled dUTP nick-end
labeling (TUNEL)

Contrast-enhanced ultrasonic imaging

Cell apoptosis was assessed using TUENL, a
method that is based on the specific binding O-TdT
to the 3-OH ends of DNA, ensuring the synthesis of
a polydeoxynucleotide polymer. For this purpose,
ApopTag Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection
Kit (Chemicon) was employed according to the
recommendation. Omission of the working strength TdT
enzyme was considered as negative control.

Ultrasound images of xenograft tumor were
obtained on anaesthetized nude mice using a Philips iU22
(Bothell, WA, USA) ultrasound scanner with the curvelinear array probe C5-2. The imaging parameters were:
power modulation (PM 3 pulses) transmit frequency
1.7MHz at low transmit power (mechanical index,0.06),
approximately 7–10 frames per s and one focus well
below the level of the target lesion to ensure a more
uniform pressure field. At each imaging session, tumor
volumes were assessed in fundamental B-mode imaging
using calipers. They were calculated using the following
formula: length × width × depth × 0.52. During each
imaging session, mice were subjected to an intravenous
bolus of 0.2 mL of contrast agent (sulfur hexafluoride,
SonoVue; Bracco, Italy) in 2 s. Subsequently, color
Doppler flow imaging was employed to visualize contrast
refilling in tumor. All the experiments were recorded on
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
The results are representative of 3 different
experiments, and data are expressed as mean ± standard
deviation. Mann-Whitney U was employed to differentiate
the means. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant. SPSS 10.0 software was employed to analyze
all data.
