Abstract
Herein, we evaluated the anti-cancer effect and molecular mechanisms of a
novel betulinic acid (BA) derivative, SYK023, by using two mouse models of lung
cancer driven by KrasG12D or EGFRL858R. We found that SYK023 inhibits lung tumor
proliferation, without side effects in vivo or cytotoxicity in primary lung cells in
vitro. SYK023 triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Blockage of ER stress in
SYK023-treated cells inhibited SYK023-induced apoptosis. In addition, we found that
the expression of cell cycle-related genes, including cyclin A2, B1, D3, CDC25a, and
CDC25b decreased but, while those of p15INK4b, p16INK4a, and p21CIP1 increased following
SYK023 treatment. Finally, low doses of SYK023 significantly decreased lung cancer
metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Expression of several genes related to cell migration,
including synaptopodin, were downregulated by SYK023, thereby impairing F-actin
polymerization and metastasis. Therefore, SYK023 may be a potentially therapeutic
treatment for metastatic lung cancer.

Introduction

anti-inflammatory activity [1, 2]. BA can suppress
tumorigenesis in several types of cancer, including lung,
colon, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers [3-7].
It has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by inducing
mitochondria-dependent apoptosis [1]. However, BA
also inhibits the expression of tumor-promoting proteins,

Betulinic acid (BA), a natural pentacyclic triterpene,
has a variety of beneficial biological activities, including
anti-tumor, anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-malarial and

tumorigenesis, but also metastasis. Metastasis occurs
when cancer cells dissociate from primary tumor, migrate
through the connective tissue and capillary walls to the
circulatory system, and form a tumor at a secondary site
[20]. Numerous processes are involved in the alterations
to cell shape and migration that promote metastasis,
including enhanced integrin expression, protease secretion,
modification of integrin/actin linkage proteins, and the
coordinated activation of the actin cytoskeleton [20, 21].
Many actin-associated proteins such as tropomyosin
and α-actinin are involved in cancer metastasis [22, 23].
Synaptopodin (SYPD), an actin-binding protein, was
initially identified as a regulator of the dendritic spine
in telencephalic neurons and the foot processes of renal
podocytes [24]. Recently, SYPD was shown to regulate
synapse plasticity [25]. Furthermore, SYPD also stabilizes
actin microfilaments and Rho family proteins, thereby
promoting migration [26, 27]. However, the role of SYPD
in cancer remains unclear despite its ability to regulate
migration and actin remodeling.
In this study, we used two mouse models with either
KrasG12D- or EGFRL858R-induced lung tumor to evaluate
the therapeutic efficacy of BA derivatives. SYK023, a
derivative of BA, contains stronger inhibitory activity than
BA in both lung cancer formations through induction of
ER stress-dependent apoptosis and reduced the metastasis
of lung cancer by impairing F-actin remodeling.

including lamin B1, ErbB2, Stat3, HIF-1α and Sp1
[5, 6, 8]. Further, we have shown that BA inhibits lung
tumor growth through the inhibition of Sp1-mediated
cyclin A2 expression in vitro and in vivo [4]. Given the
effectiveness of BA in inhibiting tumorigenesis, there
is interest in developing novel derivatives to enhance
its benefits, while minimizing side effects. Previous
work has shown that a cyano derivative of BA potently
inhibits colon and pancreatic cancer. [9]. N-Acylimidazole
and C-3 carbamate derivatives also enhance the antiproliferative effect of BA in HepG2 cells [10]. Moreover,
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone BA derivatives enhance
cytotoxicity in melanoma, anaplastic thyroid tumors,
and ovarian, lung, and breast cancer cell lines [11].
3-O-Propargylated BA containing 1,2,3-triazoles displays
a strong anti-tumor effect in leukemia cell lines [12]. In
addition, ionic and glycosylated BA derivatives display
increased solubility and improve the anti-tumor effect of
BA [13, 14]. Our previous study also indicated that 20 mg/
kg of BA can inhibit lung tumor growth in the KrasG12Dinduce lung cancer mice. However, this dose is higher
than other clinical or pre-clinical used drug. In addition,
our preliminary results also show that highly frequency
of lethality occurred after BA injection, suggesting that
BA cause high cytotoxicity toward normal cell leadings
side-effect. Based on these studies, to screen the BA
derivative(s) with higher anti-tumor activity and low sideeffect is crucial for lung cancer therapy. Therefore, we
tried to develop a new derivative of BA to enhance its’
tumor-suppressive effect without increasing the side effect
in vitro and in vivo.
Previously, BA potently induced protein
ubiquitination, including Sp1, to decrease proliferation
followed by apoptosis [4, 15], suggesting that BA
possibly increases unfolded proteins leading ER stress.
In this study, to compare the effect between BA and its
derivatives on tumor suppression, apoptosis triggered
by various pathways including traditional and ER
stress-dependent pathways will be addressed. ER stress,
promotes cell survival by adapting to environmental
stressors, including the induction of the unfolded
protein response, aberrant calcium homeostasis, glucose
deprivation, and viral infection [16]. Under persistent
stress, the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor
(eIF) 2α phosphorylation is induced, thereby inducing C/
EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression, leading to
apoptosis [17]. During tumorigenesis, dysregulation of
the unfolded protein response, such as increased protein
folding capacity in the ER, can promote cells growth [18].
Several drugs including versipelostatin, bortezomib, and
brefeldin A have been designed to prevent the increase in
folding capacity, leading to apoptosis [19].
Even though BA was confirmed as a potent anticancer drug, the effects of BA and its’ derivatives on
metastasis is rarely studied. Herein, we not only study
the difference between BA and SYK023 in suppressing

Results
BA derivatives display enhanced selectivity and
cytotoxicity than BA on lung cancer in vitro and
in vivo
Our recent study showed that BA inhibits lung
tumor growth in vitro and in vivo [4]. To identify the
compounds that best suppress tumorigenesis, twenty BA
derivatives were synthesized and their cytotoxicity in
lung cancer cells was evaluated (Supplementary Figure
S1). We found that SYK019 and SYK023 (Figure 1A1C) inhibited tumorigenesis better than BA. Interestingly,
neither BA nor SYK023 affected cell survival in normal
mouse primary lung cells (Figure 1B, left panel and
Supplementary Figure S2).
To evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the BA
derivatives in vivo, we used xenograft models and
transgenic mice that develop spontaneous lung tumors
following doxycycline treatment in Scgb1a1-rtTA/TetOKras4bG12D and Scgb1a1-rtTA /TetO-EGFRL858R mice. In
xenograft models, SYK023 significantly reduced tumor
volume and weight (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure
S3). In physiological evaluation, there is no significant
difference between normal and lung cancer mice (Table
1). In particular, we also found that BA and SYK023

did not affect the physiological functions of the liver
and kidneys by measuring several metabolic enzymes
(Figure 1C(c)), including glutamic-pyruvate transaminase
(GPT), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and
creatinine (CRE) (Table 1).
We next assessed the effect of the BA derivatives in
the transgenic lung cancer models. After confirming that
doxycycline-induced lung cancer formation in EGFRL858R
mice, we treated the mice with BA or SYK023 starting
at week 3, for 9 weeks total. While BA had a slight antitumorigenic effect, SYK023 potently blocked lung cancer
progression (Figures 1D, 2A and Supplementary Figure
S3). Compared to BA, SYK023 also inhibited lung
tumorigenesis in Kras4bG12D mice, without affecting liver
and kidney functions (Figure 2B). In contrast, SYK019
had adverse health effects in mice because the mortality
of SYK019-injected mice was higher than that of other
drug-treated mice (Supplementary Table S1). In addition,
SYK019 was not effective against lung tumors when
compared to SYK023 (Figure 1C(a-b)). Therefore, we
did not continue to study the effect of SYK019 on lung
cancer. Histological analysis of KrasG12D and EGFRL858R
mice showed that the extent of tumor formation decreased
in SYK023- treated mice compared to that in BA-treated
mice (Figure 2A, HE staining).
We next assessed how SYK023 inhibited lung
tumor growth. As shown in Figure 2A and 2C, SYK023
activated the apoptotic pathway, as indicated by the
increase in active caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase
9. Furthermore, SYK023 also induced ER stress, as
indicated by the phosphorylation of eIF2α, the increase
in active caspase 12 and the transcriptional upregulation
of CHOP. Interestingly, Sp1 was also decreased by BA
and SYK023 in both lung cancer models. These effects
were more evident in the SYK023 than in the BA treated
mice, as BA did not induce apoptosis in the lung tumors
efficiently, and did not induce ER stress in the EGFRL858R
mice. Taken together, our data indicate that SYK023 has
improved tumor-suppressive activity compared to BA due
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to its ability to activate caspases and induce ER stress.

SYK023-induced ER stress contributes to lung
cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression
We next studied the detailed molecular mechanism
of SYK023-induced apoptosis and ER stress (Figure 3).
In H1299 cells, 10 µM SYK023, not BA, increased the
expression of apoptotic markers, annexin V staining and
the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase (Figure 3A
and Supplementary Figure S4A). Moreover, SYK023
increased eIF2α phosphorylation, active caspase 12,
X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) splicing, and CHOP
transcription in H1299 cells and xenograft mice, indicating
that SYK023 induces apoptosis and ER stress in vitro and
in vivo (Figure 3B-3D). Furthermore, SYK023 (10 µM),
not BA, increased total protein ubiquitination (Figure
3E), suggesting that the accumulated misfolded proteins
are degraded by the ER-associated degradation pathway
during the process of ER stress. ER stress was previously
shown to induce apoptosis through the impairment of
mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in the release
of cytochrome c. SYK023 strongly induced the release of
cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol (Figure
3F), suggesting that SYK023-induced apoptosis is partially
dependent on ER stress. To explore whether the apoptosis
was mediated by ER stress, the eIF2α inhibitor, salubrinal
(SAL), was used. We initially confirmed that SAL is an
eIF2α dephosphorylation inhibitor in Supplementary
Figure S4B [28]. In Supplementary Figure S4C, SAL
did not induce ER stress and apoptosis, characterized by
active caspase 12 and caspase 3, respectively, in H1299
cells. Therefore, pretreatment with SAL for 2 h does not
influence cell survival in subsequent experiments. We
also further confirmed that SAL significantly prevented
tunicamycin (TM)-induced ER stress (Supplementary
Figure S4D). By the way, both the reactive oxygen species
(ROS) scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) [7], and
SAL partially inhibited BA- and SYK023-induced cell

death (Supplementary Figure S4E). In particular, when
ER stress was inhibited by SAL (Figure 3G) or CHOP
knockdown (Figure 3H), BA and SYK023 failed to induce
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. These results suggest that
SYK023-induced ER stress increases apoptosis of lung
cancer cells.
We next assessed how SYK023-induced ER stress
affected cell survival at the molecular level. Global gene
expression profiles of lung cancer cells with or without
SYK023 treatment were analyzed by cDNA microarray
(Figure 4A-4B). Interestingly, genes involved in cell
proliferation were downregulated following SYK023
treatment. In contrast, genes related to cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis were upregulated (Figure 4A-4B). In mice
with lung cancer, both of BA and SYK023 obviously
decreased the levels of cyclin A2 and cyclin E2, whereas
those of p15INK4b and p21CIP1 increased (Figure 4C).
Further, microarray analysis identified that the cyclin
B1-interacting E3 ligase was upregulated by SYK023
(data not shown), suggesting that cyclin B1 levels may
be decreased.. Accordingly, SYK023-treated mice
exhibited lower expression of cyclin B1; however, BA
did not affect cyclin B1 expression. This result suggests
that the downregulation of cyclin B1 may regulate the
enhanced anti-tumor effect of SYK023 versus BA.
Furthermore, the downregulation of cyclin A2, cyclin
B1, CDC25a, CDC25b, CCND3, and CDC6 by SYK023
and the upregulation of p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p57KIP2, and
CHOP by SYK023 were reversed by blocking ER stress
(Figure 4D-4E). However, the upregulation of p21CIP1 and
the downregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) were not dependent on ER stress, suggesting that
SYK023 inhibits cell cycle progression through ER stressdependent and -independent pathways.

remodeling. The phosphorylation of FAK, Src, Akt and
mTOR, all of which promote F-actin polymerization
[29-31], was reduced by SYK023 (Supplementary
Figure S7A). In addition, we found that SYK023 (5 µM)
effectively decreased the expression of some proteins that
promote lung tumor formation (Supplementary Figure
7B), including N-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin, and c-myc
[32-35]. These findings support the notion that low doses
of SYK023 can impair F-actin and oncoprotein expression,
without inducing apoptosis. Similar effects were not
observed with BA. Moreover, microarray analysis, which
functionally grouped using the Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis website (Figure 6A), revealed that several genes
related to migration were decreased by SYK023, including
Rho family proteins, contactin-1, intermediate filament
proteins and tubulins [36-39]. These data suggest that
SYK023 inhibits migration by dysregulating cytoskeletal
structure.
Interestingly, the actin-binding protein SYPD was
also downregulated by SYK023. SYPD, is known to
regulate cell migration and to stabilize RhoA in podocytes.
[27]. Importantly, SYPD has never been studied in
cancer. We confirmed that SYPD knockdown blocked
F-actin polymerization and expression (Supplementary
Figure S8). Moreover, SYPD expression was decreased
by BA (20 µM) and SYK023 (1 µM) (Figure 6B).
Furthermore, in addition to attenuating migration, SYPD
knockdown prevented the inhibitory effect of BA and
SYK023 on migration and F-actin remodeling (Figure
6B). In conclusion, many proteins including SYPD, are
involved in F-actin polymerization and are down regulated
following SYK023 treatment.

Overexpression of SYPD is a biomarker of lung
cancer to predict poor prognosis

SYK023 inhibits lung tumor metastasis through
the inhibition of F-actin polymerization

Since the role of SYPD in cancer is unknown, we
assessed whether SYPD is important for lung cancer
progression. Compared with IMR cells, a normal
pulmonary fibroblast cell line, the protein level of SYPD
was increased in lung cancer cells, including CL1-0, CL15 and A549 cells (Figure 6C). In KrasG12D mice (Figure
6D), SYPD expression was upregulated in lung tumors.
As expected, SYPD was reduced in the lungs of BA- and
SYK023-treated KrasG12D mice. To establish the clinical
relevance, we analyzed the SYPD level in normal and
tumor tissues from lung cancer patients that underwent
surgery (Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure S9). In
59 patients, 43 exhibited higher SYPD expression in
tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. In addition, the
mRNA level of SYPD was significantly higher in lung
tumors. Importantly, we found that SYPD overexpression
correlated with poor prognosis, suggesting that SYPD,
an actin-binding protein, participates in lung cancer
malignancy.

Using both transwell invasion and wound-healing
assays, we found that SYK023 (0.5 µM) obviously
inhibited migration without causing cell death, as
compared to BA (5 µM) (Figure 5A and Supplementary
Figure S5). Furthermore, compared to BA, SYK023 (2
mg/kg) significantly inhibited metastasis in vivo (Figure
5B). Because F-actin regulates cytoskeletal dynamics to
promote migration, we assessed whether BA and SYK023
affected F-actin remodeling. We found that F-actin
polymerization was attenuated by SYK023 (0.5 µM) or
by BA (5 µM) (Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure
S6). Strikingly, increased doses of SYK023 both blocked
F-actin polymerization and decreased the F-actin levels.
These results suggest that SYK023 inhibits migration by
inhibiting F-actin polymerization.
Based on these data, we investigated the effect
of SYK023 on signaling pathways that mediate F-actin

prostate, renal, ovarian, lung, and cervical cancers, as well
as leukemia, as assessed in cancer cell lines or xenograft
mouse models [1, 3-7]. Furthermore, we recently used
xenograft mouse models and a KrasG12D-induced lung
cancer mouse model to assess the effect of BA , and
found that it suppresses tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell
cycle progression [4]. Collectively, previous studies
indicate that BA inhibits tumorigenesis by promoting
mitochondria potential-induced cell apoptosis and the
inhibition of cellular proliferation [1]. In this study, we
studied the effect of 27 BA derivatives on lung cancer
cell proliferation. Several derivatives including SYK010,
SYK019 and SYK023 were more cytotoxic in lung cancer
cells than BA (Supplementary Figure S1). Further testing
revealed that SYK023 had fewer side effects in primary
lung cells and mice than BA, SYK010 and SYK019
(Supplementary Table S1). Therefore, we assessed the
molecular mechanisms by which SYK023 inhibited lung
tumorigenesis. Previous studies indicated that BA inhibits
the proliferation of cancer cells through inhibiting cell
cycle progression and triggering the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway [1]. In this study, we found that SYK023 not only
induced cell cycle arrest and extrinsic apoptotic pathway,
but also induced ER stress-dependent intrinsic apoptosis.
Microarray analysis revealed that the mRNA level of
CCNB1 was not altered following SYK023 treatment;
however, CCNB1 interacting protein 1 (CCNB1IP1), an
E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting cyclin B1 [40], was increased
(data not shown), suggesting that SYK023 may affect
more anti-tumor pathways than BA to inhibit cancer
cell proliferation. We then hypothesized that SYK023
may enhance the E3 ligase activity of CCNB1IP1 to
degrade cyclins. In addition, SYK023 may also induces
the expression of other unknown E3 ligases, based on
the strong ubiquitinated signal in SYK023-treated cells
(Figure 3D). Simultaneously, this signal may be attributed
to the accumulation of unfolded proteins leading to
ER stress or the inhibition of multiple deubiquitinases
in cancer cells [15]. The other nature compound,
oplopantriol, exhibits activity similar to that of SYK023,
inducing the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and
ER stress [41]. In the past, several well-known anticancer drugs exert their tumor killing effects through the
induction of ER stress, including bortezomim, brefeldin A,
curcumin, celecoxib, and heat shock protein 90 inhibitors
[42].
To confirm whether SAL increases eIF2α
phosphorylation [28], we treated H1299 cells for the
indicated period. As shown in Supplementary Figure
S4B, SAL did not affect p-eIF2α level until 16th h. In our
experiments which combines SYK023 and SAL, cells
were pre-treated with SAL for only 2 h. Therefore, SALonly should not affect eIF2α phosphorylation when cells
were treated with BA or SYK023. When we performed
experiments related to SAL, time of SAL treatment is
only 2h. We thought this treatment time do not affect cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

survival. However, to test whether SAL induces ER stress
or apoptosis, we treated H1299 cells with SAL (50 μM)
for 24h. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4C, SAL did
not decrease proliferation until 36h, indicating that SAL
did not affect cell survival during the period of SYK023
treatment. Compared with tunicamycin treatment for
24h, neither caspase 12 nor caspase 3 cleavage was not
induced by SAL. CHOP transcription was not induced by
SAL. Based on this data, we make sure that treatment of
H1299 cells with SAL for 24h did not induce ER stress or
apoptosis. Because we cannot explain why combination
of SYK023 with SAL decreases eIF2α phosphorylation.
We used caspase 12 and CHOP mRNA as the ER stress
marker instead of p-eIF2α (Figure 3G) [43, 44]. However,
SAL still attenuated SYK023-induced caspase 12 cleavage
and CHOP expression (Figure 3G). In microarray results
(Figure 4A(b)), PPP151A/GADD34, which was shown
to dephosphorylate eIF2α phosphorylation [45], was
increased by SYK023. The inhibitory effect of SAL
on eIF2α phosphorylation maybe thus antagonized by
SYK023 through GADD34. In Figure 3G, SAL prevented
SYK023-induced apoptosis, suggesting that SYK023
causes cell death through inducing ER stress. Moreover,
SYK023-mediated cytoskeleton impairment also
contributes to prevent metastasis activity of lung cancer.
In Figure 5B, 2 mg/kg of SYK023, not BA, significantly
inhibited metastasis in vivo, suggesting that, in this study,
we screen a BA derivative, SYK023, contains higher
inhibited activities of tumorigenesis and metastasis and
lower side-effect in normal cells. In addition, previous
studies also indicated that BA decreases Sp1 levels in
prostate and lung cancers [3, 23].
In studying the effects of SYK023 and BA in the
KrasG12D- and EGFRL858R-induced lung cancer mouse
models, we found that SYK023 dramatically inhibited
lung cancer nodule formation in both systems (Figures
1D, 2A and 2B). However, BA inhibited KrasG12D-induced
lung cancer formation significantly, but had the slightly
inhibitory effect on EGFRL858R-induced lung cancer
(Figures 1D, 2A and 2B). Furthermore, we also found that
Sp1 was dramatically accumulated in the lung tissue of
KrasG12D-induced lung cancer mice [46] but not found in
EGFRL858R-induced lung cancer mice. According to the
results of this study, we hypothesized that inhibition of
lung cancer growth by BA is through Sp1 degradation,
and in contrast, that of SYK023 is through both Sp1
degradation and ER stress. Our previous study indicated
that there is an inverse correlation between Sp1 level and
prognosis in clinical lung cancer patients, suggesting
that SYK023, but not BA, may be the better therapeutic
option for lung cancer, particularly for that without Sp1
accumulation which is associated with poor prognosis
[46].
The anti-tumor activity of BA in vivo is much poorer
than that of SYK023, especially in EGFRL858R mice (Figure
1), suggesting that, compared to SYK023, BA requires
13681

Oncotarget

much higher dose for tumor therapy in vivo. This increases
the possibility of side effects. Although BA did not affect
the survival of normal cells, it still cause the death of
mice during the period of treatment (Supplementary Table
S1). Herein, the number of dead mice by SYK023 was
obviously fewer than that by BA, suggesting that the
tolerance of mice to SYK023 is much better than that
to BA. SYK023 highly improved the cytotoxicity of BA
in tumor cells without increasing the occurrence of side
effect. This enhances the worth and possibility of the BA
derivative, SYK023, in clinical usage. Based on results
of Figures 2 and 5, the working dose of SYK023 and BA
is 2-5 mg/kg and 10-20 mg/kg, respectively. For a 70 kg
of man with lung cancer, the pastille form of SYK023 is
140-350 mg/tab, which is similar with that of gefitinib
(250 mg/tab) and is easily received by patients; that of BA
requires 700-1400 mg/tab. In addition, in Figures 2C and
3D, SYK023, not BA, potently induced extrinsic apoptosis
which was not dependent on ER stress (Figure 3G).
In this study, we established that BA and SYK023
can inhibit the metastasis of lung cancer. Low dose
SYK023 (0.5 µM) significantly inhibited lung cancer
metastasis (Figure 5). Gene expression profile analysis
revealed that several metastasis-related genes, including
SYPD, were decreased following SYK023 treatment
(Figure 6), suggesting that SYK023 might affect the
expression of many actin polymerization-related genes to
inhibit lung cancer cell migration. However, how SYK023
inhibits gene expression remains unclear. Our analysis also
revealed that SYK023 decreased the phosphorylation of
Src, FAK, Akt and mTOR (Supplementary Figure S7), all
of which are involved in cell survival, apoptotic pathways,
and actin polymerization in lung cancer [47, 48]. In
Figure 4D, SAL partially reversed the decrease of cyclin
expression by SYK023, suggesting that SYK023 reduces
cyclin through ER stress-dependent and -independent
pathway. In addition to inducing ER stress, SYK023 (1
μM) also destroyed cytoskeleton. This is not contributed
by ER stress. The impairment of cytoskeleton also
contributes to the alteration of gene profile. Some genes
dysregulated by SYK023 are through ER stress, some are
independent of ER stress. BA-induced ER stress maybe
not enough to drive cells for apoptosis. It is possibly
reversible. At 20-30 μM, the cytotoxicity of BA maybe
restricted in ER stress-induced mitochondria dependent
apoptosis. Therefore, BA-induced the alteration of gene
expression was prevented by inhibiting ER stress.
Metastasis is the most serious cancer-related
problem because it is not easily diagnosed in lung cancer
and often occurs before cancer has been diagnosed.
Treatments for lung cancer, including radiation,
chemotherapy, surgery, and targeted therapy, are options
for treating lung cancer that has metastasized to the liver,
brain, and bone. Testing can be performed to distinguish
if the cancer expresses mutations that have a targeted
therapy. For example, if a patient has an EGFR mutation,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib (Iressa) can be used [49].
Alternatively, the presence of an anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) gene abnormality allows for treatment
with crizotinib (Xalkori) [50]. In addition, other specific
abnormalities, such as RET, ROS-1, and KRAS mutations
are being studied to develop specific inhibitors. In this
study, SYK023 was used in KrasG12D- and EGFRL858Rinduced lung cancer to inhibit cancer formation (Figure
1), suggesting that SYK023 is useful for treating lung
cancer having oncogene mutation. Furthermore, various
metastasis-related experiments were performed in vitro
and in vivo to show that SYK023 not only decreases cancer
cell proliferation but also inhibits lung cancer metastasis
at low doses. In addition to SYPD, several cytoskeletal
proteins known to regulate migration or invasion were
also decreased by SYK023, including Rho family proteins
[51, 52], contactin-1 [53], filamin A [54], synemin [38],
capping protein [55], actin-binding LIM protein 1 [56],
TRIO, [57] and tubulin family [52] (Figure 6A). Based on
these findings, SYK023 may be a viable treatment for lung
cancer metastasis, either alone or in combination, without
causing damage to normal cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and chemical compounds
H1299 and A549 lung cancer cell lines were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). The CL-series cell lines were
provided by Dr. Pan-Chyr Yang (National Taiwan

homogenized by using 0.5% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.05% trypsin (Biological
Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) at 37oC for 1 h.
After centrifuging at 1200x g for 20 min, and filtering,
cells were resuspended by DMEM-10% FBS, and seeded
onto 6-well plates. BA was purchased from SigmaAldrich. Compounds SYK001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006
and 009 were synthesized according to the previous study
[58]. The eIF2α inhibitor, salubrinal, was purchased from
Biovision (Milpitas, CA, USA). BA, the derivatives and
salubrinal were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO;
Sigma-Aldrich).

generated as described previously [46]. Both of Scgb1a1rtTA and TetO-EGFRL858R mice were purchased from
Jackson Lab (Bar Harbor, MA, USA). After breeding,
Scgb1a1-rtTA/TetO-EGFRL858R mice were used to study
lung cancer. To induce lung cancer progression, two
month-old of transgenic mice were orally administrated
with doxycycline dissolved in RO water (0.5 g/liter).
For drug administration, Scgb1a1-rtTA/TetO-Kras4bG12D
mice receiving doxycycline for 3 months were injected
intraperitoneally with BA or its derivatives (once/3
days) for 2 months in the presence of doxycycline
administration. Scgb1a1-rtTA/TetO-EGFRL858R mice
receiving doxycycline for 3 weeks were injected with BA
or its derivatives (10 mg/kg, once/3 days) for 9 weeks.
To establish the xenograft model, male athymic
BALB/c severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice
(8 week-old) were purchased from the Animal Center of
NCKU. H1299 cells (1 x 106) in 100 µl PBS were injected
into the back of mice. After 10 days mice with obvious
tumor formation were injected intraperitoneally with BA
or its derivatives (once/3 days) for 15 days. During the
period of 15 days, tumor size was measured once/2 days
according to the previous study [4].
For metastasis assay in vivo, on Day 1, CL1-5 cells
(1 x 106) in 100 µl of PBS were injected into the right
lateral tail vein of male athymic BALB/c nude mice (8
week-old). Drugs were injected intraperitoneally into mice
once/3 days until Day 45. After sacrificing, lungs were
excised for counting tumor nodules.
