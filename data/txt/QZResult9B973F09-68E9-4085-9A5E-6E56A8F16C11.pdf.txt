Abstract
The Ca2þ-binding protein sorcin regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis and plays a role in the induction
of drug resistance in human cancers. Recently, an 18 kDa mitochondrial isoform of sorcin was reported to
participate in antiapoptosis in human colorectal cancer (CRC), but information remains lacking about the
functional role of the more abundant 22 kDa isoform of sorcin expressed in CRC. We found the 22 kDa isoform to
be widely expressed in human CRC cells, whether or not they were drug resistant. Its upregulation in drugsensitive cells induced resistance to 5-ﬂuorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, whereas its downregulation
sensitized CRC cells to these chemotherapeutic agents. Sorcin enhances the accumulation of Ca2þ in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), preventing ER stress, and, in support of this function, we found that the 22 kDa
isoform of sorcin was upregulated under conditions of ER stress. In contrast, RNAi-mediated silencing of sorcin
activated caspase-3, caspase-12, and GRP78/BiP, triggering apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Our
ﬁndings establish that CRC cells overexpress sorcin as an adaptive mechanism to prevent ER stress and escape
apoptosis triggered by chemotherapeutic agents, prompting its further investigation as a novel molecular target
to overcome MDR. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7659–69. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Several mechanisms are responsible for inducing both drug
resistance in human cancer cells and, among other functions,
the upregulation of antiapoptotic genes (1). The investigation
of these survival mechanisms responsible for drug resistance is
a critical issue, because the likelihood of designing novel
molecular targeted strategies, which would rescue the sensitivity of tumor cells to anticancer agents, relies strongly on
such knowledge. This issue is extremely relevant in the clinical
management of human colorectal cancer (CRC), the second
most common cause of cancer mortality (2, 3). Of note,
although systemic therapy for metastatic CRC has been signiﬁcantly improved, the outcome for this malignancy remains
poor, with a median overall survival rate ranging from 18 to 24

months (4). Thus, novel molecular targeted strategies are
urgently needed to revert drug resistance and improve the
efﬁcacy of systemic therapy in human CRC.
We have previously reported that TRAP1, a mitochondrial
chaperone with antioxidant and antiapoptotic functions (5–7),
is involved in MDR in human CRC cells (8). Indeed, TRAP1 is
upregulated in the majority of human CRCs (8), as well as in
other cancer types (9, 10), and its upregulation results in a
phenotype resistant to multiple chemotherapeutics in CRC cells
(8). Accordingly, the downregulation of TRAP1 by siRNA resensitizes tumor cells to apoptotic stimuli (8, 11). Starting from a
proteomic analysis of TRAP1 coimmunoprecipitation complexes, we observed that TRAP1 speciﬁcally interacts with the
18-kDa mitochondrial isoform of sorcin in a Ca2þ-dependent
manner and that this interaction is required for the antiapoptotic function of TRAP1. Interestingly, despite the signiﬁcant
homology between the 18 and the 22 kDa isoforms of sorcin, the
22 kDa isoform is not a TRAP1-interacting protein (11).
Sorcin is a Ca2þ-binding protein and is a member of the
penta-EF-hand protein family (12). Sorcin is a Ca2þ sensor
which regulates the activity of the ryanodine receptor RyRs, the
Naþ/Ca2þ exchanger NCX, and the voltage-dependent L-type
Ca2þ channel (12–14) and that, by the interaction with these
target proteins, is involved both in regulating Ca2þ homeostasis and in modulating excitation–contraction coupling in the
heart (15, 16). Some evidence suggests involvement of sorcin in
the drug resistance shown by human malignancies. Indeed,
sorcin was puriﬁed from a vincristine-resistant lymphoma cell
line (17), whereas its overexpression has also been associated
with resistance to vincristine in gastric cancer cells (18),

gemcitabine in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; ref. 19) and
CHOP regimen in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (20). Other
reports suggest a correlation between the expression of sorcin
and the MDR1/P-glycoprotein: it has been shown that sorcin
knockdown induces the upregulation of MDR1 in HeLa cells
(21); by contrast, a direct correlation between sorcin and MDR1
expression and a role of sorcin in inducing a MDR phenotype
has been observed in human leukemia and gastric carcinoma
cells (22, 23). Finally, recent studies in oral squamous cell
carcinoma, NSCLC, and acute myeloid leukemia suggest that
sorcin may be responsible for drug resistance and poor prognosis (19, 24, 25).
Because the above studies suggest an involvement of the 22
kDa sorcin isoform in the cytoprotective pathways of human
cancer cells (17–23), without providing a more in-depth explanation of its function, and considering that we previously
showed that only the mitochondrial isoform of sorcin interacts
with TRAP1 and is crucial for its antiapoptotic function (11),
we became interested in studying the expression of 22 kDa
sorcin in human CRC and in characterizing its role in the drugresistant phenotype of this malignancy.

according to Hassink and colleagues (28).
Immunoblot analysis was done as previously reported (11).
Speciﬁc proteins were detected by using rabbit polyclonal antisorcin (Ab57991; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-sorcin (a kind
gift from Prof. E. Chiancone, University of Rome "La Sapienza"),
mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase; sc-47724; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse
monoclonal anti-tubulin (sc-8035; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
mouse monoclonal anti-TRAP1 (sc-13557; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-Calnexin (M-108, sc-5627; Santa

Caspase-3 (sc-56051; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-COX IV antibodies (MS407; Mitosciences).
RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA from cell pellets and tumor specimens was
extracted using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Primers and
experimental conditions are reported as Supplementary
Methods.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, cell cultures, constructs, and siRNAs
Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise speciﬁed. Human HT-29 and HCT-116 colon carcinoma
cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and cultured as previously reported (11). Cell lines
were routinely monitored in our laboratory by microscopic
morphology. Cell line authentication was done before starting
this study by evaluating, respectively, the presence of a mutation in codon 13 of the ras proto-oncogene in HCT-116 cells,
according to the ATCC product description, and the presence
of the BRAF V600E mutation in HT-29 cells (26). HT-29 CRC
cells resistant to single agents were selected as previously
reported (27).
Full-length 22 kDa sorcin cDNA was cloned in pRC-CMV
vector (Invitrogen) and stably transfected in HCT-116 cells.
siRNA SRI3, which downregulates both sorcin isoforms, was
purchased from Qiagen (catalogue no. S10048118). siRNA
speciﬁc for the 22-kDa sorcin isoform was custom designed
as reported in Supplementary Methods. For knockdown
experiments, siRNAs were transfected by using HiPerFect
Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen).

[Ca2þ]i and [Ca2þ]m measurement and mitochondrial
membrane potential
[Ca2þ]i was measured by single-cell computer-assisted video
imaging (29). The equation of Grynkiewicz and colleagues was
used for calibration (30). Ca2þ content into ER was evaluated as
cytosolic Ca2þ release by using the irreversible and selective
inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2þ ATPase
(SERCA) thapsigargin (Tg; 1 mmol/L; ref. 31). [Ca2þ]m was
assessed using the ﬂuorescent dye X-Rhod1 (32). Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the ﬂuorescent
dye tetramethyl rhodamine ethyl ester in the "redistribution
mode" (32).
Statistical analysis
The paired Student's t and the 1-way ANOVA, followed by
Newman–Keuls tests were used to establish the statistical
signiﬁcance between, respectively, different levels of apoptosis,
mitochondrial membrane potential, and [Ca2þ] in transfected
cells and the respective scramble controls. Spearman rank and
Kendall tau tests were used to establish the statistical correlation between sorcin protein levels and, respectively, histopathologic parameters and TRAP1 protein levels.

Results
Cytotoxicity assays
Apoptosis was evaluated by cytoﬂuorimetric analysis of
Annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D–positive cells as previously reported (11).
Membrane fractionation, proteinase K digestion, and
immunoblot analysis
Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were puriﬁed using the Qproteome Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Qiagen),
according to the manufacturer's protocol. In speciﬁc experiments, the ER fraction was treated with 1 and 4 mg/mL

showed that the 22 kDa isoform of sorcin was upregulated in 28
of 59 (47.5%) carcinomas, whereas real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that only 5 of 14 colorectal
tumors with increased 22 kDa sorcin protein levels were
characterized by a concomitant upregulation of its transcript
(Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that both transcriptional
and posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved in the regulation of 22 kDa sorcin expression. By contrast, the 18 kDa
mitochondrial isoform of sorcin was upregulated in a minority
of human CRCs (11/59 tumors, 18.6%), and its upregulation
was also dependent on either transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms (data not shown). Interestingly,
besides this different expression proﬁle, a signiﬁcant correlation was observed between the protein levels of 18 and
22 kDa sorcin isoforms (Spearman rank, P ¼ 0.001; Kendal
tau, P ¼ 0.003).
The protein expression of sorcin isoforms was analyzed for
the major histopathologic parameters of human CRC. A signiﬁcant correlation was observed between the expression of 22
kDa sorcin and either tumor grading (Kendal tau, P ¼ 0.01),
depth of intestine wall invasion (Spearman rank, P ¼ 0.04;
Kendal tau, P ¼ 0.005), presence of lymph node (Spearman
rank, P ¼ 0.05; Kendal tau, P ¼ 0.004), or distant (Kendal tau,
P ¼ 0.01) metastases, whereas a trend toward a positive
correlation was observed between 22 kDa sorcin levels and
tumor stage (Kendal tau, P ¼ 0.08). No statistical correlation
was observed between 18 kDa sorcin levels and the same
histopathologic parameters. The expression of 22 kDa sorcin
was also analyzed for TRAP1 protein levels (Supplementary
Table S2) because our previous studies showed that the
expression of this mitochondrial TRAP1/HSP75 chaperone is
increased in 65% of human CRCs (8), and a signiﬁcant coex-

www.aacrjournals.org

pression of the two proteins was observed in tumor specimens
(Spearman rank, P ¼ 0.002; Kendall tau, P ¼ 0.00001).
The major interest of our group is to identify new molecular
mechanisms/targets for colon cancer chemoresistance. To this
aim, sorcin expression was evaluated in HT-29 CRC cells
resistant to ﬂuorouracil (FU), oxaliplatin (l-OHP), and irinotecan (IRI), and a signiﬁcant upregulation of the 22 kDa
isoform was observed (Fig. 1B). Real-time RT-PCR showed a
modest upregulation of 22 kDa sorcin transcript only in IRIresistant HT-29 cells (data not shown), consistently with the
relevance of posttranscriptional mechanisms in the regulation
of sorcin protein expression.
The fractionation of subcellular compartments revealed
that the 22 kDa sorcin band is present in the cytoplasm and
in the ER (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1), as previously
reported in ventricular cardiac myocytes (15), whereas the 18
kDa isoform, known to be a TRAP1 interactor (11), is restricted
to the mitochondria both in HCT-116 CRC cells (Fig. 1C) and in
CRC HT-29 FU-resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A), as well
as in a representative case of human CRC (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). Considering the functional role of sorcin in ER calcium
homeostasis, the "topology" of sorcin ER localization was
further evaluated through biochemical assays on the basis of
protease digestion. Interestingly, the exposure to proteinase K
of the ER subfraction revealed that 22 kDa sorcin is located
within the ER, similarly to the molecular chaperone calnexin, a
well-known ER-resident protein (ref. 33; Fig. 1D).
The 22 kDa isoform of sorcin is involved in MDR in
human CRC cells
Some evidence suggests that sorcin may be responsible for
inducing MDR in human tumors (17–23), but no information is

The downregulation of 22 kDa sorcin in drug-resistant
CRC cells restores the sensitivity to antiblastic agents

We further evaluated whether the selective silencing of 22
kDa sorcin by siRNAs is able to restore sensitivity to
chemotherapeutics in drug-resistant cells. To address this
issue, we used wild-type HT-29 cells and HT-29 cells resistant to FU, l-OHP, and IRI, which had been previously
characterized by increased expression of 22 kDa sorcin

increased rates of apoptosis upon treatment with the
respective resistance antiblastic agent (Table 3).
The antiapoptotic activity of 22 kDa sorcin involves
the regulation of Ca2þ homeostasis in the ER
Because sorcin is involved in the regulation of Ca2þ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes, mainly by regulating the activity of
the ryanodine receptor RyRs (12, 15), we questioned whether
the cytoprotective activity of 22 kDa sorcin might depend on its
ability to modulate intracellular Ca2þ levels. To this aim, Tg, an
inhibitor of the SERCA pump, was used to induce the release of
Ca2þ from the ER, thus providing an indirect measure of Ca2þ
levels into the ER (31). In fact, by blocking Ca2þ uptake from
cytosol, Tg was able to induce a progressive and complete ion
depletion from ER (Fig. 2A and B). Interestingly, the exposure of
HCT-116 cells to FU determined changes in the ER Ca2þ
content that were dependent on drug concentration. Indeed,
after 48 hours of exposure to 10 mmol/L FU, a greater accumulation of Ca2þ was detected in all treatment conditions, as
an initial response to this toxic stimulus (Fig. 2C). Interestingly,
the Tg-induced Ca2þ release reached signiﬁcantly higher levels
in HCT-116 sorcin transfectants than in all other experimental
conditions, suggesting that the upregulation of 22 kDa sorcin
favors accumulation of Ca2þ into ER. This effect was prevented
in 22 kDa sorcin-depleted cells. By contrast, the exposure of the
same CRC cell lines to 40 mmol/L FU for 48 hours, a treatment
that induces higher levels of apoptosis (data not shown),
resulted in signiﬁcant depletion of ER Ca2þ levels in pRC- and
siRNA-transfected cells and a further increase in ER Ca2þ
accumulation among 22 kDa sorcin transfectants (Fig. 2C). In
the same experimental conditions, a signiﬁcant increase in
cytosolic Ca2þ levels was observed only in pRC- and siRNAtransfected cells exposed to 40 mmol/L FU for 48 hours (see
legend to Fig. 2). Similarly, 22 kDa sorcin HCT-116 transfectants treated with 30 mmol/L l-OHP for 48 hours exhibited an
increased release of Ca2þ from the ER compared with the
respective untreated conditions (Fig. 2D). Such evidence suggests that the overexpression of 22 kDa sorcin in CRC cells
induces the accumulation of Ca2þ into the ER and that this
correlates with resistance to apoptosis.
The 22 kDa sorcin is involved in protecting from ER
stress and preventing the opening of the mitochondrial
transition pore
Because the perturbation of Ca2þ homeostasis in the ER is a
major event which triggers ER stress (34), we evaluated whether a correlation between sorcin expression and ER stress could
be observed in our experimental systems. A signiﬁcant upregulation of 22 kDa sorcin was observed upon treatment of
HCT-116 cells with 2 mmol/L Tg for 7 hours, a condition that
induced ER stress (ref. 35; Fig. 3A). Accordingly, the selective
downregulation of 22 kDa sorcin in HCT-116 CRC cells treated
with 10 mmol/L FU resulted in reduced levels of caspase-3 and
the proteolytic cleavage of the caspase-12 precursor, a molecular event which triggers apoptotic signaling in response to ER
stress (ref. 35; Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the downregulation of 22
kDa or both sorcin isoforms by siRNAs resulted in increased
upregulation of GRP78/BiP, a well-known molecular ER chap-

erone (36), in response to Tg (Fig. 3C). By contrast, the 22 kDa
sorcin exhibited a protective activity toward ER stress, as
revealed by the reduced levels of GRP78/BiP mRNA upon Tg
stimulation compared with pRC-transfected cells (Fig. 3C).
Finally, because exposure to 40 mmol/L FU resulted in a
condition of ER stress with depletion of Ca2þ levels in the ER
and a parallel increase in cytosolic Ca2þ (Fig. 2C), we questioned whether the localization of sorcin was modiﬁed by this
treatment. Interestingly, the exposure of HCT-116 cells to 40
mmol/L FU for 48 hours resulted in a translocation of 22 kDa
sorcin from the ER to the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 3D).
These results suggest that the upregulation of the 22 kDa sorcin
isoform prevents the ER stress response and that its cytoprotective function might depend on its role in Ca2þ homeostasis
in the ER.
The perturbation of Ca2þ homeostasis in the ER and the
consequent ER stress represent conditions that favor apoptosis
through the opening of the mitochondrial transition pore
(MTP; ref. 37); we thus questioned whether sorcin-dependent
protection of apoptosis may involve the mitochondrial antiapoptotic pathway and the modulation of mitochondrial function. To this aim, the rate of apoptosis induced by antiblastic
agents was analyzed (i) in 22 kDa sorcin HCT-116 transfectants
after selective downregulation of TRAP1, a mitochondrial
chaperone known to antagonize the activity of cyclophilin
D, an immunophilin that induces mitochondrial cell death
(5), and (ii) in HCT-116 cells depleted of 22 kDa sorcin and
treated with cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of MTP opening (38).
Interestingly, TRAP1 interference by siRNA restored the sensitivity to FU-, l-OHP-, and IRI-induced cell death in 22 kDa
sorcin HCT-116 transfectants (Table 1), whereas the inhibition
of MTP opening by cyclosporine A prevented apoptosis
induced by antiblastic agents in 22 kDa sorcin-depleted
HCT-116 cells (Table 2). These results suggest that the cytoprotective activity of 22 kDa sorcin involves the modulation of
mitochondrial function.
The role of 22 kDa sorcin in the modulation of mitochondrial
activity was further supported by experiments aimed at measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium
concentration ([Ca2þ]m). Indeed, the silencing of 22 kDa sorcin
induced a signiﬁcant mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and a reduction in [Ca2þ]m (Fig. 4A), whereas 22 kDa
sorcin overexpression induced a signiﬁcant mitochondrial
depolarization and a slight mitochondrial calcium increase
(Fig. 4C). These results suggest that, by modulating mitochondrial membrane potential, 22 kDa sorcin plays a crucial role in
the regulation of mitochondrial calcium efﬂux. Interestingly,
treatment with cytotoxic concentrations of l-OHP (40 mmol/L)
in 22 kDa sorcin-silenced HCT-116 cells, although reducing
mitochondrial calcium levels to the same extent as untreated
silenced cells, restored the mitochondrial membrane potential
(Fig. 4B). These effects might be responsible for greater susceptibility of 22 kDa sorcin-depleted HCT-116 cells to apoptosis induced by antiblastic agents. Consistently, the restoring of
mitochondrial membrane potential in 22 kDa sorcin-silenced
HCT-116 cells treated with l-OHP, together with lowering of
[Ca2þ]m, might preserve metabolic cell rate and ATP production, thus contributing to apoptotic cell death.

Several observations suggest that sorcin is involved in a

responsible for drug resistance (17–23). However, to our
knowledge, no evidence has been reported for a role of the 22

Antiapoptotic Role of Sorcin in Human Colorectal Cancer

TRAP1 regulation of cell survival (11). Although this observation provides mechanistic insights into the cytoprotective role
of the mitochondrial sorcin isoform, suggesting that its antiapoptotic function depends on its participation in the TRAP1
pathway (11), it does not provide any information on the
cytoprotective function of the 22 kDa isoform of sorcin, which
is the most abundant cellular isoform and is not a TRAP1
interacting protein (11). Here, we report that 22 kDa sorcin is
upregulated in about 50% of human CRCs, and its upregulation
induces protection against drug-induced apoptosis. Because a
signiﬁcant amount of the protein is localized within the ER and
previous studies have shown that sorcin is involved in modulating the ryanodine receptor RyRs (12, 15), an ER-resident
protein responsible for Ca2þ efﬂux from the ER (39), we
questioned whether the cytoprotective activity may be mediated by its ability to regulate Ca2þ homeostasis in the ER. This
hypothesis is in agreement with several lines of evidence
arguing in favor of a role of ER Ca2þ content in the resistance
to stress and apoptotic stimuli (34, 40). Our results suggest that
the treatment of sorcin overexpressing HCT-116 CRC cells with
FU and l-OHP induced a dramatic response to Tg, an inhibitor
of SERCA, responsible for the depletion of ER Ca2þ content
and, thus, a widely used tool for measuring Ca2þ levels in the ER
(31). Therefore, it is likely that the upregulation of 22 kDa sorcin
favors the accumulation of Ca2þ into the ER, possibly by
inhibiting RyRs receptors (15), and this may be responsible
for the cytoprotective function exerted by the calcium-binding
protein. Indeed, sorcin-dependent accumulation of Ca2þ into
the ER seems to be critical in preventing ER stress and in
protecting tumor cells from apoptosis, because 22 kDa sorcin is
upregulated in response to conditions of ER stress. Furthermore, ER-associated sorcin translocates to cytosol under conditions of high apoptotic cell death, thus determining greater
ER Ca2þ depletion. By contrast, the selective downregulation of
22 kDa sorcin results in the activation of caspase-3 and
caspase-12, in the upregulation of GRP78/BiP, and in the
sensitization of tumor cells to drug-induced apoptosis by
lowering the threshold of MTP opening. Indeed, downregulation of 22 kDa sorcin is associated with hyperpolarization of
the mitochondrial membrane and reduced calcium content in
mitochondria which, in turn, might promote drug-induced
apoptosis.
Such evidence is consistent with previous studies suggesting
that modulation of Ca2þ homeostasis is a crucial step in the
regulation of cell response to stress conditions and in favoring
drug resistance in tumors (40, 41). Indeed, neuronal cells
exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation activate the
Naþ/Ca2þ exchanger NCX1, which is known to be a target
protein of sorcin (14), and this is correlated with accumulation
of Ca2þ into the ER, and prevention of ER stress and apoptosis
(42). Furthermore, increased levels of Ca2þ in the ER have also
been correlated with MDR phenotypes in cancer cells (41, 43).
Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that sorcin isoforms are both
involved in regulating Ca2þ homeostasis in separate cell compartments and that this function is relevant for their antiapoptotic activities in tumor cells. Indeed, the 2 proteins,
though translated from 2 independent transcripts, are almost
identical in their structure because they share 5 EF-hand

www.aacrjournals.org

motifs, typical calcium-binding sites, and diverge at the
N-terminus due to the absence of 15 amino acids in the
mitochondrial isoform. Although the role of 18 kDa sorcin in
the regulation of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis needs to
be conﬁrmed by further studies, it is likely that the 22 kDa
sorcin isoform is one of several ER stress proteins involved in
the control of Ca2þ levels in the ER, preventing ER stress and
the subsequent apoptotic events, and may co-operate with 18
kDa sorcin in controlling Ca2þ homeostasis in mitochondria
contributing to the regulation of the MTP opening. This
hypothesis, although still preliminary, sheds some light on the
relevance of the TRAP1/18 kDa sorcin interaction and the role
of this sorcin isoform in the TRAP1 cytoprotective pathway.
Indeed, the activity of TRAP1 chaperone may be crucial for 18
kDa sorcin transport/stability in mitochondria because sorcin
lacks a mitochondrial localization sequence (11), and this
interaction contributes to sorcin-induced regulation of Ca2þ
homeostasis in mitochondria and Ca2þ-dependent MTP regulation. In addition, recent evidence suggests that TRAP1 may
be also involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein
response induced by ER stress (44, 45), suggesting a potential
cross-talk between mitochondria and the ER stress response
pathways (46). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that, in our series of human CRCs, TRAP1 expression
correlates with 22 kDa sorcin levels. Thus, it is likely that 22 kDa
sorcin and TRAP1 are components of a coordinated adaptive
response of tumor cells to counteract ER stress conditions and
apoptotic signaling.
To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst evidence of a role
played by sorcin in resistance to FU, IRI, and l-OHP, 3
chemotherapeutics that represent the backbone of human
CRC treatment (47). Apoptosis assays upon selective RNAi
knockdown of 22 kDa sorcin in drug-resistant CRC cells
suggest that targeting sorcin may form the basis for a novel
therapeutic strategy for improving the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutics in CRCs. Indeed, previous studies in several
human tumor cell models evaluated verapamil, an agent
blocking Ca2þ inﬂux through L-type Ca2þ channels, and
suggested that such a strategy may antagonize P-glycoprotein–mediated MDR in vitro, but it provided uncertain
results in clinical trials (41). However, because sorcin overexpression has been correlated with upregulation of MDR1/
P-glycoprotein (22, 23) and because P-glycoprotein–dependent MDR phenotype seems to be related to intracellular
Ca2þ homeostasis (41), our results suggest that targeting 22
kDa sorcin may represent an innovative strategy to prevent
Ca2þ accumulation in the ER and likely revert the MDR
phenotype. Thus, further studies are needed to conﬁrm the
relationship between sorcin, Ca2þ homeostasis, and the
MDR phenotype and to design agents able to modulate ER
Ca2þ through the inhibition of 22 kDa sorcin activity.
Interestingly, several signaling pathways induced by ER
stress are currently regarded as novel molecular targets for
cancer therapy (34).
