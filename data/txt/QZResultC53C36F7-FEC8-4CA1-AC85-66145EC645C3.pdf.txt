ABSTRACT
Progestin resistance is a main obstacle for endometrial precancer/cancer
conservative therapy. Therefore, biomarkers to predict progestin resistance and
studies to gain a more detailed understanding of the mechanism are needed. The
antioxidant Nrf2-AKR1C1 signal pathway exerts chemopreventive activity. However
whether it plays a role in progestin resistance has not been explored. In this study,
elevated levels of AKR1C1 and Nrf2 were found in progestin-resistant endometrial
epithelia, but not in responsive endometrial glands. Exogenous overexpression of
Nrf2/AKR1C1 resulted in progestin resistance. Inversely, silencing of Nrf2 or AKR1C1
rendered endometrial cancer cells more susceptible to progestin treatment. Moreover,
medroxyprogesterone acetate withdrawal resulted in suppression of Nrf2/AKR1C1
expression accompanied by a reduction of cellular proliferative activity. In addition,
brusatol and metformin overcame progestin resistance by down-regulating Nrf2/
AKR1C1 expression. Our findings suggest that overexpression of Nrf2 and AKR1C1 in
endometrial precancer/cancer may be part of the molecular mechanisms underlying
progestin resistance. If validated in a larger cohort, overexpression of Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 may prove to be useful biomarkers to predict progestin resistance. Targeting
the Nrf2/AKR1C1 pathway may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treatment
of endometrial hyperplasia/cancer.

INTRODUCTION

summarized elsewhere [20–27]. One of the Nrf2 target
genes related to this study is aldoketo reductase family
1 member C1 (AKR1C1). It possesses an antioxidant
response element (ARE) in the promoter region which
is regulated by Nrf2. AKR1C1 is a key component
of antioxidant response element in the Nrf2 signal
transduction pathway [28]. It is known that the main
biologic function of AKR1C1 is to convert progesterone
to its inactive form, 20-alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone
(20-alpha-OHP) [29, 30]. AKR1C1 also contributes to
decrease local concentrations of progesterone in late
secretory endometrium within the menstrual cycle [31].
The aberrant expression of AKR1C1 has been observed
in endometrial cancers [30, 32, 33], and overexpression
of AKR1C1 may result in an inhibition of cellular
production of progestin receptor [32]. In our previous
endometrial cancer studies, we showed that high level of
Nrf2 expression is clearly responsible for chemoresistance
[23, 34]. More importantly, brusatol, a specific inhibitor of
Nrf2, could reverse chemoresistance in multiple cancers
including endometrial cancer [35, 36].
In this study, we examined the role of Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 in the process of progestin resistance with the
following approaches: 1) to test the level of Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 protein expression in progestin treated endometrial
cancer samples; 2) to examine the progestin resistance
through up- or down-regulation of Nrf2 and AKR1C1
expression in 2 endometrial cancer cell lines; and 3) to test
if the progestin resistance could be reversed by addition of
metformin and brusatol, and the effects of these agents on
Nrf2 and AKR1C1 expression.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth leading cause of
cancer-related death in women worldwide, with the
majority of cases arising in post-menopausal women [1].
However, one of the endometrial precancers, referred
to as atypical hyperplasia or endometrial intraepithelial
neoplasia, and well-differentiated cancer tend to occur in
younger women [2–5]. Hysterectomy may not be an ideal
management choice for those patients when they either
have a desire to maintain their fertility or not suitable
for surgery. When this happens, progestin treatment as a
conservative management is commonly applied. However,
approximately 30% of such patients fail to respond to
progestin therapy [6]. Currently, there is no good way
to identify or predict which group of patients may respond to
the progestin treatment.
To better identify suitable candidates for the
progestin treatment and to better understand the
mechanisms of progestin resistance, significant research
efforts including ours have been made in the last 2 decades
to address the issue [7–12]. Down-regulation of progestin
receptor (PR) resulting from continuous progestin
administration leads to desensitization to progestin [13],
which was thought to be one of the reasons of progestin
resistance, while intermittent progestin withdrawal
treatment significantly increases the apoptotic rate of
endometrial cancer cells [14]. Other molecules including
those in the EGF/EGFR [15, 16] and insulin [9] signaling
pathways may also contribute to progestin resistance.
In our earlier studies, significant decrease of survivin
expression was seen in progestin responders, whereas, no
significant level changes of survivin expression were seen
in non-responders [7]. In a similar setting, we have also
found that up-regulation of Fas/FasL expression may help
response to progestin therapy in patients with endometrial
hyperplasia, while dysregulation of Fas/FasL expression
partially contributes to the progestin resistance [10]. It is
interesting to note that Glyoxalase I (GloI) may represent
another molecule involved in progestin resistance [11].
Metformin, a well-known medication for diabetes control
with multiple function in cancer therapy, cell senescent
and aging [17–19], could reverse progestin resistance
by decreasing GloI expression [11]. Despite all these
efforts and progresses observed in the past, however, the
majority of the studies remain at the descriptive stage. The
molecular mechanisms underlying progestin resistance
remains to be demonstrated in order to improve patient
care.
Mounting evidence from recent studies showed
that the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
plays a critical role in cancer development, recurrence
and resistance to adjuvant chemo- and/or radiation
therapies [20–23]. The mechanisms of Nrf2 mediated
drug resistance involve multiple genes and details of the
molecular pathways of such drug resistance have been

RESULTS
Endometrial changes, Nrf2 and AKR1C1
expression in post progestin treated endometrial
samples
Nrf2 and AKR1C1 expression were directly correlated
to the progestin resistance. In the responder group, Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 were negative in all 11 post-progestin treated
endometrial samples, while they were highly expressed
in the samples of partial responders and non-responders
(p < 0.001). The detailed results are summarized in Table 1
and representative pictures of Nrf2 and AKR1C1 expression
are illustrated in Figure 1. Nrf2 and AKR1C1 were stained
in cytoplasm and mainly found in endometrial glandular
cells with only occasional stromal cell stain.

High levels of Nrf2 expression and progestin
resistance
After observing such a striking Nrf2 and AKR1C1
expression pattern in partial and non-responding
endometrial samples, we sought to investigate if these
two molecules may contribute to progestin resistance

in endometrial cancer. To address this issue, we first
examined the level of Nrf2 expression under basal and tertbutylhydroquinone (tBHQ)-induced conditions in vitro by
using endometrial cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 2A,
tBHQ could induce Nrf2 expression in both cell lines,
with similar basal Nrf2 protein levels observed between
Ishikawa and RL95–2 cells. MTT assay revealed that both
cell lines responded well to progestin treatment showing
a steady decline in growth activity in a dose dependent
manner, with no significant difference between the cell

lines found (Figure 2B). Taking into consideration that high
levels of Nrf2 are reported to be related to chemotherapy
resistance [24], the role of elevated Nrf2 in progestin
resistance was further studied by using stably transfected
cell lines. As shown in Figure 2C, overexpression of
Nrf2 significantly enhanced Nrf2 protein level, which
resulted in 2.4-fold decrease of cell apoptotic rate when
compared with the vector-transfected control cells. The
RL95–2 cells showed similar results (data not shown).
Conversely, the effect of silencing of Nrf2 by siNrf2 in

Nrf2 stably transfected endometrial cancer cells was
evaluated. Downregulation of Nrf2 protein expression by
this approach was confirmed. This resulted in a 2.1-fold
sensitization of these cells to 40  μM MPA treatment
(Figure 2D). Nrf2-transfected RL-95–2 cells similarly
showed a 1.9-fold sensitization to progestin in the same
setting (data not shown). This suggests that high levels of
Nrf2 are associated with progestin resistance.

control group (Figure 3B). To clarify whether AKR1C1
is required in Nrf2-drived progestin resistance, Nrf2transfected stable Ishikawa cells were transfected with
siAKR1C1 or siCon, followed by progestin treatment.
As shown in Figure 3C, despite there was no alteration
of Nrf2 expression after AKR1C1 was knocked down,
transfection with siAKR1C1 profoundly increased the
sensitivity to progestin treatment. It is demonstrated that
the Nrf2-related progestin resistance can be corrected by
reducing the level of AKR1C1 expression.

Nrf2 associated progestin resistance through
AKR1C1 mediation

Progestin withdrawal resulted in reduced the
survival endometrial cancer cells in parallel with
down regulation of Nrf2-AKR1C1

To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying
the Nrf2-driven progestin resistance, we examined the
relationship between Nrf2 and AKR1C1 since both
molecules are related to drug resistance and AKR1C1
is a downstream gene of Nrf2 [29]. Consistent with the
findings from IHC of this study and previous observations
[29, 38], Nrf2 enhanced AKR1C1 expression in a dosedependent manner (Figure 3A). Transient transfection
of Nrf2 plasmid resulted in the elevation of both Nrf2
and AKR1C1 protein expression. Paralleling with these
findings was the decreased susceptibility to progestin
treatment when compared with the vector-transfected

As hormone withdrawal usually causes ‘breakdown’
of the endometrium, we assessed whether removal of MPA
may change the level of Nrf2 and AKR1C1 expression as
well as its cell growth activity. As shown in Figure 3D,
reduction of Nrf2 and AKR1C1 expression was observed
starting from MPA removal at 48 h and became pronounced
at 72 h. Consistent with these results, continued decline in
cell proliferation with a maximal 2.1-fold decrease after
72 h of MPA removal was observed (Figure 3E).

Downregulation of Nrf2 and AKR1C1 by
brusatol and metformin to overcome progestin
resistance

and progestin-resistant cells compared with treatment
with MPA or metformin individually. Compared with the
effect of metformin alone, brusatol (20 nM) had a more
profound inhibitory effect on both progestin sensitive
and resistant cells. Strikingly, co-treatment with brusatol
and MPA also led to a more pronounced decrease in cell
growth compared with MPA treatment alone in both cell
lines (Figure 4D). This demonstrates significant effects of
both metformin and brusatol on both progestin sensitive and
resistant endometrial cells. The effect was not specific to
the progestin-resistant cells, as the progestin sensitive cells
were also sensitized by metformin or brusatol to progestin.

Given that Nrf2 and AKR1C1 play important roles
in progestin resistance, significant therapeutic advantage
may be achieved by targeting Nrf2 and its downstream
genes. Our previous findings indicate that brusatol is able
to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy by inhibiting
Nrf2-mediated cancer cell defense mechanism [35] and it
has been shown that metformin is able to reverse progestin
resistance for patients with endometrial precancers [9, 39].
Based on these understandings, we examined the role of
brusatol and metformin in our experimental system to
see if these molecules are potentially useful for clinical
application. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, both brusatol
and metformin suppressed Nrf2 and AKR1C1 protein
expression in a dose-dependent manner in Ishikawa-Nrf2
cells, similar inhibition effects also observed in Ishikawa
cells (Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, metformin was
able to inhibit the level of expression of the both molecules
in a time-dependent fashion (Figure 4C). The inhibition
time manner by brusatol was documented in our previous
report [35]. The cell viability assay revealed that treatment
with 10 μM MPA alone has no significant inhibition effect
on progestin-resistant Ishikawa-Nrf2 cells compared with
its control, whereas treatment with metformin (1 mM) plus
MPA remarkably reduced the cell viability of both control

DISCUSSION
Many women in the reproductive age with
endometrial precancers (atypical hyperplasia or endometrial
intraepithelial neoplasia) and well-differentiated endometrial
cancer have a strong desire to preserve fertility. Clinicians,
however, have to follow these patients closely during the
progestin conservative therapy since approximately 30% of
such patients fail to respond to the progestin treatment [6].
One of the main reasons for such a high failure rate is that
the molecular mechanisms of progestin resistance remain
unclear. Our group has been interested in this research topic
for a long time [7, 8, 11, 14]. Along the line of searching
for biomarkers of prediction and revealing the molecular
mechanism of progestin resistance, we recently came across

the findings that Nrf2 and AKR1C1 were overexpressed
only in partially responding and non-responding endometrial
cancer samples after progestin treatment. In contrast to these
partial or non-responders, there was no Nrf2 and AKR1C1
expression found in endometrial samples showing complete
response after progestin treatment. Although the sample size
of this study is relatively small, the findings are encouraging,
which prompted us to search for the molecular mechanism
underlying this observed progestin resistance.
In contrast to a protective role, Nrf2 has recently
been shown to be related to drug resistance of human
cancers [21, 24]. Interfering with Nrf2 expression by
siRNA could effectively enhance sensitivity to cisplatin
and arrest the cell cycle at G1 phase with a reduction
of the phosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein
in lung cancer cells [21]. We previously showed that
Nrf2 is overexpressed in endometrial cancer and genetic
depletion of Nrf2 sensitizes endometrial cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic drugs [23]. We recently provided
evidence that inhibition of Nrf2 expression by brusatol
could overcome chemotherapy resistance in many
cancers including endometrial cancer [35]. These findings
suggest that activation of Nrf2 in cancer cells provides
advantages for cancer cell survival under chemotherapy
pressure. However, such effect has never been explored in
progestin resistance of endometrial proliferative lesions.

Exploring the Nrf2 mediated molecular mechanisms
was initiated when we observed striking phenomenon of
Nrf2 overexpression in those non- or partially responded
endometrial samples after progestin treatment. Since
AKR1C1 represents a downstream gene of Nrf2 and it
is readily available for a potential mechanistic study, we
tested the Nrf2-AKR1C1 signal transduction pathway in
this setting. One novel and intriguing finding in this study
was that AKR1C1 is overexpressed in endometrial glands
from partial or non-responders, but no expression in that
of complete responders (Figure 1). Such observations
indicate that progestin resistance may be related to
the intrinsic overexpression of Nrf2-AKR1C1 signal
transduction pathway, while normal or decreased Nrf2AKR1C1 function may be indicative of good response to
progestin treatment.
A similar increased level of Nrf2 and AKR1C1
expression has been reported in pancreatic cancer and
such elevation may be associated with resistance to
chemotherapeutic intervention [39]. It was noted that
reduction of AKR1C1 by siRNA in human colon cancer
enhances the sensitivity toward cisplatin, whereas overex­
pression of AKR1C1 is highly associated with the cisplatin
resistance [26]. Similar findings were also observed
in gallbladder and lung cancers [40, 41]. These results
pointed out that Nrf2 and AKR1C1 contribute to the failure

MATERIALS AND METHODS

of drug treatment. Based on these findings, we think that
the elevated AKR1C1 and Nrf2 in endometrial cancer
may represent a poor prognosis due to the emergence of
progestin resistance. To further investigate how Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 contribute to endometrial precancer/cancer
progestin resistance, we performed the mechanism
related experiments in vitro. Transient (data not shown)
or stable transfection of Nrf2 significantly attenuated
the susceptibility to progestin treatment (Figure 2C).
Conversely, knockdown of Nrf2 in these stable cells
sensitized them to progestin treatment (Figure 2D). In
terms of AKR1C1 regulation, the results paralleled those
of Nrf2. Exogenous overexpression of AKR1C1 resulted in
enhanced progestin resistance (Figure 3B). However, while
maintaining a high level of Nrf2 in Nrf2 stably-expressed
endometrial cancer cells, silencing of AKR1C1 alone
abolished Nrf2-associated progestin resistance (Figure 3C).
These findings indicate that Nrf2-AKR1C1 pathway may
be not only responsible to the progestin resistance, but
also reveals AKR1C1 being the key downstream regulator.
This may be attributed to AKR1C1 special function as
an enzyme to convert progesterone to its inactive form,
20-alpha-OHP [31, 43]. In addition, AKR1C1 binding with
the PRB promoter and decreasing progestin-dependent PR
activation [32] may also contribute to progestin resistance.
This is consistent with what we observed in our previous
and current studies that the level of Nrf2/AKR1C1 is
persistently decreased, while PR is elevated in endometrial
cancer cells after MPA withdrawal [7, 10]. It seems that
the decreased level of progestin catalyzed by AKR1C1 may
limit its interactions with PR and potentially contribute
to the failure of progestin therapy in those non-optimal
responders.
Down regulation of Nrf2/AKR1C1 is benefit to
endometrial cancer cells sensitizing to progestin. As
a unique inhibitor of Nrf2 expression, brusatol was
examined and has been found to be able to reverse
progestin resistance in the endometrial cancer cell lines
with decrease of Nrf2/AKR1C1. Similar results were
observed in metformin treated cells. These findings
are consistent with previously demonstrated clinical
observations [9] and in vitro experiments [43]. It is
encouraging that both brusatol and metformin may be
used in clinic to increase the sensitivity and efficacy of
progestin treatment for those endometrial precancer or
cancer patients who desire conservative therapy.
In summary, we have in this study demonstrated for
the first time that Nrf2 and AKR1C1 overexpression is
likely one of the main molecular mediators of progestin
resistance in patients with endometrial precancers and well
differentiated carcinomas. Down regulation of Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 through brusatol and/or metformin application
may prove to be useful to overcome progestin therapy
failure. In addition, if validated, overexpression of Nrf2
and AKR1C1 may be confirmed to be useful biomarkers
to predict progestin resistance.

Selection of matched cases
Twenty-one post-progestin-treated endometrial
hyperplasia (n = 15) and cancer (n = 6) samples were
enrolled in this study. These specimens were comprised
of 11 complete responders, 4 partial responders and 6
non-responders (failure to response to progestin treatment).
Pathological diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia or welldifferentiated carcinoma was reviewed and confirmed by
gynecologic pathologists (JYP and WZ) on the basis of
WHO classification. H & E sections of endometrial samples
obtained at least after 6 months of progestin administration
were assessed for therapeutic responses. Patients were
considered to have complete regression of hyperplasia
(responders) if post progestin treated samples showed
decidualized stroma with attenuated endometrial glands;
If more than 50% of the entire sample contained residual
hyperplasia similar or worse than the findings prior to the
progestin treatment, the patient was considered to have
persistent disease (non-responder); If residual hyperplastic
glands comprising 50% or less, it was classified as partial
response. The criteria for the responders vs non-responders
were referenced based on previous publications [7, 10].
All the tissue samples were obtained from the Department
of Pathology, University of Arizona and the study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board.

Tissue processing and immunohistologic (IHC)
analysis
All human endometrial tissue samples were
fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed routinely
for paraffin embedding. Five-micron sections for
immunohistochemistry (IHC) were cut and placed on
positively charged glass slides. IHC analysis of Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 protein expressions was performed as previously
described [7] and assessed using a semi-quantitative
method [24]. Briefly, specimens were deparaffinized
in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol,
subsequently, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked
by a 10-minute treatment with 3.0% hydrogen peroxide.
The sections were then, after antigen retrieval, incubated
overnight with rabbit anti-human Nrf2 and AKR1C1
primary antibodies at 4°C in a humid chamber, followed
by a 50-minute incubation with biotinylated secondary
antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Omitted primary
antibodies served as negative controls. Expression of
Nrf2 and AKR1C1 protein was assessed using a semiquantitative method. The stained slides were evaluated
under routine microscopy for the percentage of positively
stained cells (0–4) and the intensity of the staining (1–3)
in the interested areas. The score of percentage is defined
as follows: 0 = completely negative; 1 = less than 25%
of positive cells; 2 = number of positive cells between

26–50%; 3 = number of positive cells between 51–75%,
and 4 = more than 75% positive cells. Intensity is defined
as follows: 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = strong. Index
of Nrf2 and AKR1C1 expression was calculated as
percentage × intensity of the staining. Therefore, score 0
represents negative (–), 1–4 as weak positive (+), 5–8 as
positive (++), and 9–12 as strong positive (+++). All IHC
slides were reviewed independently by two investigators
(Ji Young Park and WZ).

cell lines was performed as previously described [23].
Briefly, cells were seeded in 0.1 ml of growth medium in
96-well plate without antibiotics, 24 hours later,
transfection of Nrf2 or AKR1C1 siRNA was done
according to the manufacturer’s instructions with Hiperfect
transfection reagent (Qiagen). After knockdown 16 h, the
cells were treated with different dose of MPA for another
48 h, the cell viability was determined by MTT assay.

Immunoblot analysis

Cell lines and cell culture

For purpose of determining the alterations of Nrf2
and AKR1C1 after various treatments, western blots were
performed as previously described [23]. The primary
antibodies Nrf2, AKR1C1 and Tubulin were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The expression patterns
of Nrf2 and AKR1C1 in Ishikawa and RL95–2 were
also detected by western blots with or without tBHQ
treatment, which is a Nrf2 inducer, impairs the activity of
the Keap1-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through modifying
the critical cysteine residues in Keap1, particularly C151,
leading to stabilization of Nrf2 protein.

Two established progestin sensitive endometrial
cancer cell lines including Ishikawa and RL95–2
were used in the experiments. The Ishikawa cell line,
an estrogen-responsive cell line derived from a welldifferentiated endometrioid carcinoma, was maintained in
our lab. We have used it to investigate the role of Nrf2
in chemoresistance in endometrial cancer [23]. RL95–2,
also derived from endometrioid carcinoma, was purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) F-12 1:1 medium (GIBCO) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA),
100 U/ml penicillin, sodium pyruvate and L-glutamine in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Ishikawa and RL95–2 cells were treated with
10 μM MPA for 24 h, and then withdrawed and cultured
for another 24, 48 and 72 h, the cells were harvested and
analyzed by Western blot to detect the changes of Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 protein expression. The cells were also treated
with 10  μM MPA alone, MPA plus 20  nM brusatol, or
MPA plus 1 mM metformin for 48 h to examine the cell
viablility and proliferative activities.

Transient transfection of the cell lines and
progestin administration
To investigate the roles of Nrf2 and AKR1C1 in
progestin resistance, exogenous transfection of Nrf2 and
AKR1C1 were performed. Briefly, after serum starvation
for 24 hours, Ishikawa and RL95–2 cells were transfected
with pCI-Nrf2 or pCI-AKR1C1 expression plasmids
using Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
transfection efficiency was determined by Western blot
analysis. After transfection for 16 h, Nrf2- or AKR1C1transfected cells and their corresponding controls were
treated with different dose of MPA for another 48 hours.
Cell proliferation was determined by the MTT assay.

Statistical analysis
Comparisons among multiple groups were made
with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Dunnet t-test. Statistical significance between the treated
and untreated groups was analyzed by Student’s t test, and
the statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

To identify whether silencing of AKR1C1 or Nrf2
could block Nrf2-drived progestin resistance, Ishikawaand RL95–2 derived stable cell lines, with incorporation
of Nrf2 or an empty vector, were established using
retrovirus system as described previously [23, 24]. Stable
Ishikawa and RL95–2 cells were continuously cultured
in medium containing 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (sigma). The
