BACKGROUND: High-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard therapy for refractory/relapsed aggressive lymphoma. In the era of rituximab-containing frontline regimens, it is becoming more challenging to salvage patients in this setting, and novel approaches are required. This is a randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of
standard-dose ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) combined with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (Z-BEAM) and ASCT in refractory/
relapsed aggressive lymphoma. METHODS: Forty-three patients with CD20þ-aggressive lymphoma were randomized to a treatment
arm (Z-BEAM, n ¼ 22) or control arm (BEAM alone, n ¼ 21). Ibritumomab tiuxetan was given at 0.4 mCi/kg on day 14 before ASCT.
RESULTS: Patient characteristics, engraftment kinetics, and toxicity profile were similar between the 2 groups. Two-year progressionfree survival (PFS) for all patients was 48% (95% confidence interval, 32%-64%): 59% and 37% after Z-BEAM and BEAM alone, respectively (P ¼ .2). Multivariate analysis identified advanced age (hazard ratio [HR], 8.3; P ¼ .001), high-risk disease (relapse within 12
months of diagnosis and/or secondary International Prognostic Index >2; HR, 2.8; P ¼ .04), positive positron emission tomographycomputed tomography pretransplant (HR, 2.4; P ¼ .07), and BEAM alone (HR, 2.8; P ¼ .03) as poor prognostic factors. Intermediaterisk patients with 1 or 2 risk factors had better PFS with Z-BEAM compared with BEAM: 69% and 29%, respectively (P ¼ .07). Twoyear overall survival was 91% and 62% after Z-BEAM and BEAM, respectively (P ¼ .05). Similar prognostic factors determined survival.
The HR for BEAM alone in the multivariate analysis was 8.1 (P ¼ .01). CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose ibritumomab tiuxetan combined
with BEAM high-dose chemotherapy is safe and possibly more effective than BEAM alone as a conditioning regimen for ASCT in the

INTRODUCTION
High-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard therapy for patients
with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma who are chemosensitive to second-line chemotherapy. The PARMA
study, reported in 1995, is the only randomized study comparing salvage chemotherapy with salvage chemotherapy followed by ASCT in this setting. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients randomized to ASCT in this study
was 46%, compared with 12% in the nontransplant group.1 However, the PARMA trial was conducted in the prerituximab era. The use of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, in frontline chemotherapy has dramatically changed
the outcome of patients with aggressive lymphoma, increasing both response and survival rates.2-4 However, despite this
progress a significant proportion of patients with aggressive lymphoma are still refractory or relapse after frontline rituximab-containing therapy. Moreover, it is increasingly more difficult to rescue these patients with current salvage chemotherapy and ASCT approaches.
The recently reported Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) identified prior treatment
with rituximab as an adverse prognostic factor in relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma, especially in those relapsing
within 12 months of diagnosis.5 The 3-year event-free survival was 21% in patients previously treated with rituximab,
compared with 47% in rituximab-naive patients. Novel approaches are in need to improve outcome in these patients.

Theoretically, these can include better salvage regimens,
better conditioning regimens for ASCT, and/or maintenance treatment after ASCT. Rituximab-containing salvage regimens have been shown to be more effective, but
mostly in rituximab-naive patients.5-8 Rituximab maintenance or consolidation after SCT to target minimal residual disease is another appealing approach.9-11 The results
of the second randomization study in the CORAL trial
are awaited to confirm this strategy.
No single preparative regimen before ASCT has
been shown to have an advantage in disease eradication
over the others. Lymphomas are inherently radiosensitive
malignancies. Total body irradiation (TBI) has been used
as part of conditioning regimens for ASCT. However,
there are concerns about toxicity and long-term effects
associated with TBI, and there are no data to support
TBI-containing regimens over regimens containing highdose chemotherapy alone. Radiolabeled antibodies such
as yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) and iodine-131 tositumomab (Bexxar) are increasingly used in
indolent lymphomas, but are also effective in aggressive
lymphomas.12 Several studies used radioimmunotherapy
in combination with high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT
with promising results (reviewed in Shimoni and Nagler13
and Gisselbrecht et al14).
In this randomized multicenter study, we evaluated
the safety and efficacy of standard-dose ibritumomab
tiuxetan combined with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy
(Z-BEAM) and ASCT in patients with relapsed/refractory
aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the era of rituximab-containing frontline therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility

The current study included patients with CD20þ-aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma including diffuse large cell
lymphoma or transformed follicular lymphoma. Patients
were eligible if they failed to achieve complete remission
(CR) with initial chemotherapy or they relapsed after CR
but were chemosensitive to second-line chemotherapy.
Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computerized tomography
(PET-CT) was performed before ASCT. Chemosensitivity was defined as having at least 50% reduction in the
bidimensional measurements of the largest mass. Active
central nervous system disease at the time of ASCT was
not allowed. Unlike standard criteria for ibritumomab
tiuxetan treatment, bone marrow involvement and pancytopenia did not exclude treatment, as patients were given
autologous stem cells after completion of the treatment

plan. A maximum of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens were
allowed. Secondary International Prognostic Index (IPI)
was calculated at disease relapse by standard criteria. In
patients with primary refractory disease, IPI was calculated at the start of second-line chemotherapy. Patients
were considered at high risk for relapse after ASCT if they
had disease progression within 12 months of initial diagnosis or if they had secondary IPI >2. Patients were
required to be free of marked organ dysfunction and to
have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1, by standard institutional eligibility
criteria for ASCT. Patients were required to have an autologous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized
peripheral blood stem cell collection of at least 2  106
CD34þ/kg. All patients gave written informed consent,
and the study was approved by the institutional review
board. The study was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as
NCT00491491.
Treatment Protocol

This study was a prospective multicenter randomized
study designed to compare 2 conditioning regimens given
before ASCT for chemosensitive aggressive lymphoma,
Z-BEAM and BEAM alone. Therefore, patients were registered and randomized only after completion of secondline chemotherapy and stem cell collection and within 2
weeks of admission for ASCT. On the basis of this design,
all patients were given their assigned therapy, and there
was no dropout after randomization. Prior therapy was
determined by the referring physician and was usually RCHOP for first-line therapy and platinum-based secondline therapy. Patients randomized to Z-BEAM were given
rituximab 250 mg/m2 followed by ibritumomab tiuxetan
0.4 mCi/kg (capped at 32 mCi) on day 14 before
ASCT. Dosimetry was not used, and there were no dose
adjustments based on blood counts or other criteria. Both
groups were given high-dose BEAM chemotherapy,
which started on day 6 and included carmustine 300
mg/m2 on day 6, etoposide 200 mg/m2 daily, cytarabine
200 mg/m2 every 12 hours on days 5 to 2, and
melphalan 140 mg/m2 on day 1. Chemotherapy doses
were calculated by adjusted body weight. Autologous
stem cells were infused on day 0. Filgrastim 5 lg/kg was
administered from day þ4 until engraftment. Standard
institutional protocols were used for transfusions and antibiotic therapy for neutropenic fever. Valacyclovir
was given for 1 month for prevention of herpes simplex
reactivation, and trimetoprim-sulfamethoxasole was given
for 6 months for prevention of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia.

Evaluation of Response and Follow-up

Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were defined as the
first of 3 days with absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
>0.5  109/L and the first of 7 days with an untransfused
platelet count >20  109/L, respectively. Toxicity after
ASCT was graded by the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Md) Common Toxicity Criteria. Disease response
was evaluated by Cheson revised response criteria.15 CR
was defined as the complete disappearance of all PET-positive masses and clearance of marrow when applicable.
Patients were assessed for disease involvement by PETCT and bone marrow biopsy (in patients with a history of
marrow involvement) before ASCT, 1 and 3 months after
ASCT, and then at 3- to 6-month intervals for 24 months
after ASCT or as clinically indicated. Patients relapsing
after ASCT were usually given chemotherapy selected at
the discretion of the center and attending physician.
4708

Responding patients with adequate medical status were eligible for allogeneic transplantation.
Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint in this study was PFS at 2 years after ASCT. Relapse and progression were defined according to Cheson’s revised response criteria as the appearance
of any new lesion or increase by >50% of previously
involved sites from nadir.15 Lesions were required to be
PET positive to define progression. PFS was calculated
from the day of ASCT until disease progression, death, or
last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from
the day of ASCT until death or last follow-up. It was calculated that to detect an expected increase of 20% in PFS
from 50% to 70%, with a 5% significance level, 100
patients would need to be randomized for 1 of the treatment groups, over 3 years. The study was stopped after

enrollment of 43 patients because of slow accrual, as will
be further discussed. Randomization was stratified by the
participating center, but not by other prognostic factors
because of the expected accrual number. Numerical variables between groups were compared with a t test and categorical variables with chi-square test. The probabilities of
OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method.16 The effect of various patient and disease categorical variables on survival probabilities was studied with
log-rank test. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard
model with hierarchical forward entering was constructed
to assess prognostic factors.17 Survival and hazard ratio
(HR) probabilities were presented with 95% confidence
intervals. All reported P values are 2-sided, and P < .05
was considered significant.
RESULTS
Patient and Disease Characteristics

Forty-three patients were enrolled on the study. Patient
and disease characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The
median age was 55 years (range, 23-67 years). Disease histology was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n ¼ 31),
mediastinal lymphoma (n ¼ 3), or transformed follicular
lymphoma (n ¼ 9). Forty-one patients had chemosensitive disease to second-line therapy after failure to achieve
CR with first-line therapy (n ¼ 5) or after disease relapse
from a first remission (n ¼ 36). Two patients with transformed follicular lymphoma were transplanted in first
remission after only 1 line of therapy. In all but 1 patient,
the first line of therapy included rituximab. PET-CT

before ASCT was positive in 17 patients (40%). There
were no significant differences in patient characteristics
between the Z-BEAM and BEAM groups.

All 43 patients achieved primary engraftment. The median time to ANC 0.5  109/L was 10 days (range, 7-21
days). The median time to platelet count 20  109/L was
13 days (range, 8-32 days). There was no difference in
engraftment kinetics between the 2 treatment groups.
There were no infusion reactions associated with ibritumomab tiuxetan. The toxicity profile is outline in Table
2. Mucositis requiring narcotics was common in both
groups, with a trend for a higher incidence after ZBEAM. Other grade III toxicities were relatively rare and
transient. Neutropenic fever was common and not different in both groups; however, there was a higher incidence
of more serious infections, such as pneumonia or fungal
infections, after Z-BEAM. All patients recovered from the
early transplant-related toxicities, and there were no
deaths within the first 100 days from any cause.
Response and PFS

At the time of first evaluation, approximately 1 month after ASCT, 42 patients were in CR with negative PET-CT,
including 16 of the 17 patients with positive pretransplant
PET-CT. With a median follow-up of 29 months (range,
12-50 months), 20 patients relapsed, and 1 died of a nonrelapse cause. The actuarial 2-year PFS is 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32%-64%). No difference in relapse
patterns could be detected within this limited number of
events. Table 3 outlines the univariate and multivariate
analysis of factors predicting for PFS. There was a statistically nonsignificant trend in the univariate analysis for
better PFS after Z-BEAM compared with BEAM alone:
59% and 37%, respectively (P ¼ .2, Fig. 1, Top). The
multivariate Cox proportional hazard model identified
advanced age (55 years), high-risk disease (defined as
relapse within 12 months of diagnosis and/or secondary
IPI >2), positive PET-CT before ASCT (borderline), and
treatment with BEAM alone as adverse prognostic factors,
with HRs of 8.3, 2.8, 2.4, and 2.8, respectively (Table 3).
Although based on small numbers in each subset, it seems
that patients with none of the first 3 risk-factors had excellent outcome regardless of treatment group (5 of 5 alive
and progression-free, Fig. 1, Middle). Conversely, patients
with all 3 risk-factors had poor outcome (all 6 patients
progressed). However, among patients with 1 or 2 risk
factors (32 patients, 16 in each group), conditioning with
Z-BEAM was associated with better outcome: 2-year PFS

OS and Late Toxicity

At the time of writing, 32 patients were alive and 11 had
died (10 of disease relapse, and 1 patient in the Z-BEAM
group died 8 months after ASCT of JC virus encephalitis).
The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 77% (95% CI,
63%-90%). OS was 91% (95% CI, 79%-100%) and
62% (95% CI, 39%-85%) after Z-BEAM and BEAM
alone, respectively (Fig. 2, P ¼ .05). The better survival after Z-BEAM was partly related to better salvage responses
after relapse. Among relapsing patients, the 1-year OS after relapse was 87% and 47% after Z-BEAM and BEAM,
respectively (P ¼ .07). All patients were given salvage
chemotherapy for relapse. Five of 8 patients relapsing after
Z-BEAM ultimately had allogeneic transplant; 1 died
early, and 4 became long-term survivors, although 2 later
relapsed. Three of 12 patients after BEAM alone were
given allogeneic transplants; 2 died early and 1 became a
long-term survivor (P ¼ not significant). Multivariate
4710

analysis identified high-risk disease and treatment with
BEAM alone as adverse prognostic factors, with HRs of
7.8 and 8.1, respectively (Table 4). Advanced age and positive PET-CT before SCT had borderline significance.
Similarly to the analysis of PFS, patients with 1 or 2 disease risk factors benefited more from Z-BEAM. Two-year
OS in these patients was 100% and 63% after Z-BEAM
and BEAM, respectively (P ¼ .008).
Two patients, both in the Z-BEAM group, had protracted poor graft function after ASCT. Neither had marrow involvement at the time of ibritumomab tiuxetan
administration or a poor graft that would predict this
outcome. Both later relapsed and were salvaged with allogeneic SCT. None of the patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome or a secondary malignancy.

relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma. It suggests that
the addition of ibritumomab tiuxetan to BEAM highdose chemotherapy is safe and possibly more effective in
disease eradication. The 2-year PFS was 59% and 30% in
the Z-BEAM and BEAM arms, respectively (P ¼ .20).
The 2-year OS was 91% and 62%, respectively (P ¼ .05).
There was no significant added toxicity with the ZBEAM regimen.
There are 3 potential approaches for the use of
radioimmunotherapy in ASCT. The radioconjugate can
be administered in the standard treatment dose combined
with high-dose chemotherapy, as in this study. Krishnan
et al reported the use of Z-BEAM in 60 patients with various types of lymphoma.18 The 2-year PFS in the 20
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was 68%,
compared with 48% in historical controls. In a following
report, they compared 46 patients with aggressive lymphoma given Z-BEAM to a matched control cohort given
TBI-based conditioning.19 Z-BEAM had a similar relapse
incidence to TBI with lower toxicity, resulting in
improved survival. The 4-year survival was 81% and
53%, respectively. This regimen was also used safely in
patients with low-grade lymphoma.20
The second approach is to escalate the radioconjugate dose beyond the standard dose. Winter et al used an
individualized ibritumomab tiuxetan dose calculated to
deliver a maximum of 15 grays to critical organs.21 The 4year PFS in a group of 44 patients, 30% with less than a
partial response to prior chemotherapy, was 43%. This
approach requires accurate dosimetry to calculate a dose
that will not deliver excess radiation to critical organs. The
third approach is to use high doses of the radioconjugate

alone, followed by stem cell support with no additional
high-dose chemotherapy.22,23 This approach was used
mostly in patients considered not eligible for standard
ASCT. Devizzi et al used ibritumomab tiuxetan at 0.8 to
1.2 mCi/kg, 2 to 3 the standard dose, in 30 patients.23
The regimen was safe, with promising results: a 2-year
PFS of 69%. Similar approaches have been used with iodine-131 tositumomab (Bexxar) as the radioconjugate,
with similar outcomes.13,14,24 A large Blood and Marrow
Transplant Clinical Trials Network randomized study
comparing iodine-131 tositumomab-BEAM and BEAM
has completed accrual, and results are eagerly awaited.
The first approach was used in the current study
because there is no evidence to support 1 approach over
the others, and we were seeking a regimen that will be
widely applicable. Ibritumomab tiuxetan dosing was used
without prior imaging, as is the common practice in
Europe. Ibritumomab tiuxetan in standard dose is dosed
based on body weight alone. Dosimetric studies demonstrated that in this dose there is minimal exposure to nontargeted tissues. No significant correlation was found
between biodistribution of the radionuclide and toxicity.

Therefore, ibritumomab tiuxetan was approved in the European Union without the necessity for imaging studies.
The use of a fixed standard dose is easier, does not require
specific expertise, allows ambulatory treatment, and limits
the costs related to dosimetry and escalated doses of the
radioconjugate, which may become prohibitive. Ibritumomab tiuxetan, being a pure beta emitter, is not associated with radiation risk to the patient family and health
care providers, and can routinely be given to ambulatory
patients.
This randomized study confirmed the previously
reported observations that the addition of ibritumomab
tiuxetan to high-dose chemotherapy is safe and not associated with excess toxicity. Although there was a trend for
more mucositis and more serious infections in the ZBEAM arm, there was no excess in critical organ toxicities,
and all toxicities were reversible, with no early deaths. The
cause of increased rate of infections is not clear, but they
did not result in any mortality or irreversible morbidity.
Engraftment was not significantly affected by ibritumomab tiuxetan, as the residual radiation dose at the time of
stem cell infusion, 14 days after treatment, or >5 halfCancer

lives of the agent, was reported by other groups to be very
low.21,23 Two patients in the Z-BEAM group had protracted poor graft function. Theoretically, targeting radiation to the marrow in patients with active marrow
involvement at ASCT may cause stromal damage. However, none of these patients had such involvement, and
other causes may have contributed to this finding. Longterm safety requires longer follow-up. Several group
reported few patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, but
this can be related to ASCT itself. The risk of myelodysplastic syndrome after ibritumomab tiuxetan therapy was
reported to be low,25 and Devizzi et al reported no cytogenetic abnormalities after high-dose ibritumomab tiuxetan
and ASCT.23
PFS after ASCT is highly dependant on several
prognostic factors. This makes the results of different
studies difficult to compare and strengthens the need for
randomized studies. Chemosensitivity to the salvage regimen is the most important factor for the success of ASCT,
such that patients who do not have at least a partial
response to second-line chemotherapy are not generally
accepted as ASCT candidates.26 Z-BEAM may be able to
partially overcome the poor prognosis of chemorefractoriness.21,27 When the secondary IPI was retrospectively
applied to patients included in the PARMA study, it
could distinguish patients with different survival probabilities.28 Hamlin et al applied the secondary age-adjusted
IPI to 150 patients treated for relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma.29 Among the patients with chemosensitive disease (ASCT candidates), 4-year PFS was 69%,
46%, and 25% for patients with low, intermediate, and
high secondary IPI, respectively. Several studies have
shown that positive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET
before ASCT is associated with a poor outcome. Derenzini et al showed a 3-year PFS of 87% and 35% in patients
with negative and positive FDG-PET scans before
ASCT.30 These observations were recently confirmed in a
meta-analysis.31 Schot et al combined FDG-PET with the
clinical risk scores. Both were independent predicting factors, and the combined score separated patients into 4
groups with PFS of 5% to 100%.32 Relapse within 12
months from diagnosis has been shown in the PARMA
trial as a very poor prognostic factor.33 Similarly, the
CORAL study identified early relapse, secondary IPI >1,
and prior rituximab therapy as poor prognostic factors in
relapsed lymphoma.5 Three major risk factors were identified in the current study. Advanced age was a dominant
poor prognostic factor. Disease risk defined as relapse
within 12 months of diagnosis and/or secondary IPI >2
was another significant risk factor. These 2 known risk

factors were combined to reduce the number of subsets in
this limited patient group. Positive PET-CT was a third
factor. The effect of prior rituximab could not be analyzed, as all but 1 patient had rituximab with frontline
therapy. These risk factors were combined, similarly to
the approach of Schot et al, showing a wide separation in
prognosis. Patients with none of these factors had an
excellent outcome, whereas patients with all 3 factors had
a dismal outcome regardless of the regimen used. The intermediate group with 1 or 2 risk factors had a PFS of
48%. In this group, Z-BEAM was shown to have an
advantage over BEAM alone, with 2-year PFS of 69% and
29%, respectively (P ¼ .07) and 2-year OS of 100% and
63%, respectively (P ¼ .008). It is possible that higher
than standard doses of the radioconjugate will benefit
higher-risk patients, but this has not yet been tested. The
current observations must be considered with caution, as
they are based on small patient subsets. We cannot rule
out that subtle differences in the risk profile between the
groups that were not statistically significant because of
patient numbers contributed to the difference in survival.
However, these observations can serve as hypothesis generating for further studies. Results of any future clinical
study should be interpreted in light of these prognostic
factors.
The major limitation of this study is the low patient
number, resulting from early closure of the study because
of low accrual. Rituximab in frontline chemotherapy leads
to selection of a poor-risk population at relapse that is
becoming a major challenge. Other studies have shown a
lower response rate at relapse for patients with prior rituximab therapy. The study was designed to compare 2 conditioning regimens; therefore, patients were randomized
only after documented response to second-line therapy.
We do not have data on response rate before randomization, but based on the above discussion, we can expect
that improved outcome after first-line therapy and low
response rate after relapse led to the low accrual. It seems
that even for responding patients, results are currently inferior to those of patients in the prerituximab era, as
PFS in the control group was only 37%. This emphasizes
the need for better regimens. Larger, international
studies with longer follow-up will be needed to confirm
these observations before the new Z-BEAM regimen
can be accepted as a standard of care for ASCT in the era
of rituximab-containing front-line and second-line
chemotherapy.
