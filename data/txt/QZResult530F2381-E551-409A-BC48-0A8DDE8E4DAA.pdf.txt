ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance has appeared to mitigate the efficiency of anticancer drugs
and the possibility of successful cancer chemotherapy. The Hedgehog receptor Patched
is a multidrug transporter expressed in several cancers and as such it represents a
new target to circumvent chemotherapy resistance. We report herein that paniceins
and especially panicein A hydroquinone, natural meroterpenoids produced by the
Mediterranean sponge Haliclona (Soestella) mucosa, inhibit the doxorubicin efflux
activity of Patched and enhance the cytotoxicity of this chemotherapeutic agent
on melanoma cells in vitro. These results are supported by the molecular docking
performed on the structure of the bacterial drug efflux pump AcrB and on the
Patched model built from AcrB structure. Docking calculations show that panicein A
hydroquinone interacts with AcrB and Patched model close to the doxorubicin binding
site. This compound thus appears as the first antagonist of the doxorubicin efflux
activity of Patched. The use of inhibitors of Patched drug efflux activity in combination
with classical chemotherapy could represent a novel approach to reduce tumor drug
resistance, recurrence and metastasis.

in many aggressive cancers (breast, lung, colorectal,
ovarian, pancreatic cancers, melanoma or multiple
myeloma [2, 3]), in particular in cells exhibiting resistance
to chemotherapeutic agents such as cancer stem cells or
tumor initiating cells. Recently, Yue and collaborators
showed that the Hh signaling is critical for lung squamous
cell carcinomas (SCC) recurrence, metastasis and
resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting that inhibition
of the Hh pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for
the treatment of lung SCC patients [4]. Several studies
have shown that antagonizing the Hh signaling receptor
Smoothened (Smo) could provide a way to interfere
with tumorigenesis and tumor progression [2, 5–8].

INTRODUCTION
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway regulates
body patterning and organ development during embryo
development. In adults, the Hh pathway is mainly
quiescent with the exception of roles in tissue maintenance
and repair, and its inappropriate reactivation has been
linked to several human cancers. Activation of Hh
signaling occurs when Hh binds to its receptor Patched,
causing the translocation of GLI1/2A into the nucleus
to activate target genes such as snail, bcl2 and cyclin D,
leading to proliferation, EMT and cell survival [1]. Indeed,
aberrant activation of the Hh signaling has been identified

Vismodegib, designed to selectively inhibit Hh signaling
by targeting Smo, is a first-in-class investigational oral
medicine for basal-cell carcinoma treatment [2, 9]. It has
been reported that autocrine expression of Hh morphogens
such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is required for growth of
some cancers [10, 11], and stromal cell-derived Shh can
also activate the Hh pathway in tumors [12]. A Shhspecific monoclonal antibody (5E1) has been shown to
inhibit the growth of several tumors, including small-cell
lung carcinoma, by preventing Shh binding to its receptor
Patched [13]. Moreover, the use of an antibody directed
against one of the Patched extracellular domains involved
in the interaction with Shh as well as peptides designed
to compete with Shh for binding to Patched were shown
to inhibit proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells [14,
15]. In addition to targeting tumors that have hyperactive
Hh pathway themselves, antagonists of the Hh pathway
could also affect growth of tumors that use Hh ligands
to induce angiogenesis [16, 17] or recruit other types of
stromal cells. Because adults can tolerate inhibition of the
Hh pathway [18], specific inhibition of Hh signaling offers
an efficient treatment for diverse cancers originating from
aberrant Hh pathway activation.
Two different genes (Patched 1 and Patched 2)
encode homologues of the Drosophila Hh morphogen
receptor Patched. Mice deficient in Patched 2 are viable,
but develop alopecia and epidermal hypoplasia and have
increased tumor incidence in the presence of a mutant
allele of Patched 1. Loss of Patched 1, in turn, results in
complete activation of the Hh pathway, suggesting that
Patched 1 is the functional ortholog of Drosophila Patched
[1]. The expression of Patched 1, here referred as Patched,
is induced upon activation of the Hh pathway in several
cancers: lung, breast, basal cells of the skin, melanoma,
prostate, colon, brain [2, 19, 20] and myeloid leukemia
[21, 22]. Moreover, recent studies propose Patched as an
early marker of gastric and thyroid cancers [23, 24].
We recently discovered that the Hh receptor Patched
has a drug efflux activity and contributes to the resistance of
cancer cells to some chemotherapeutic agents [25]. Indeed,
human Patched expressed in yeast conferred resistance to
several chemotherapeutic agents used to treat metastatic
cancers (doxorubicin, methotrexate, temozolomide, 5-FU)
and increases doxorubicin efflux. This yeast model has been
extended to fibroblasts (often used to study Hh signaling)
and human cancer cell lines which endogenously express
Patched such as melanoma cell lines. The presence of Shh,
the ligand of Patched which induces Patched internalization
and degradation, was shown to increase the accumulation of
doxorubicin into these cells and its cytotoxicity. Altogether,
these results suggest that the Hh receptor Patched
participates to chemotherapy resistance, and they prompted
us to propose Patched as a new target for anti-cancer
therapy. Discovering compounds able to inhibit the drug
efflux activity of Patched would then lead to an increase
in the efficiency of chemotherapy and thus to a reduction
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the risk of metastasis and recurrence for patients with
cancers expressing Patched. We then generated innovative
yeast- and cell-based screenings to identify molecules
able to inhibit the drug efflux activity of Patched. For this
purpose, we decided to screen natural compounds produced
by marine sponges commonly found in the Mediterranean
Sea. Indeed, sponge natural products have already been
identified as promising and original leads for therapeutic
applications [26–28], and the high biodiversity of marine
sponges growing in the diverse Mediterranean ecosystems
is a guarantee of a large chemodiversity, enabling us to
explore a significant volume of a “bioactive” chemical
space. In the present study, we show that four known
paniceins isolated from the species Haliclona (Soestella)
mucosa [29] significantly inhibit the resistance to the
chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin of yeast expressing
human Patched. One of these compounds, namely panicein
A hydroquinone (1), enhances the accumulation and the
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin for two melanoma cell lines,
and we show that these effects are due to the inhibition of
Patched doxorubicin efflux activity.

RESULTS
Paniceins isolated from the sponge Haliclona
(Soestella) mucosa are inhibitors of the resistance
to doxorubicin of yeast expressing Patched
In a previous study, we showed that the expression
of human Patched allowed yeast to grow in the presence
of a concentration of doxorubicin (dxr) that inhibits the
growth of control yeast, indicating that Patched confers
resistance to dxr [25]. From these results, we developed
a screening test in 96-well plates to identify compounds
capable of inhibiting the resistance of yeast expressing
human Patched to dxr. First, the methanolic fractions
of fifteen representative Northwestern Mediterranean
sponges (Cymbaxinella verrucosa [30], Cymbaxinella
damicornis, Ircinia variabilis, Ircinia oros, Agelas
oroides, Aplysina cavernicola, Haliclona (Soestella)
mucosa, Phorbas topsenti, Chondrosia reniformis,
Chondrilla nucula, Haliclona (Halichoclona) fulva,
Crambe crambe, Haliclona (Rhizoniera) sarai, Acanthella
acuta, Scopalina lophyropoda) were obtained after C18
Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) of a MeOH/DCM 1:1
extract of each sponge. These fractions were subsequently
dissolved in DMSO and added at a final concentration
of 10 μg/mL to yeast expressing Patched in a medium
supplemented or not with dxr (Figure 1). The methanolic
fraction obtained from the sponge Crambe crambe
completely repressed the growth of yeast expressing
Patched even in the absence of dxr and appeared to be
cytotoxic for yeast. The methanolic fractions obtained
from Haliclona (Soestella) mucosa and Haliclona
(Rhizoniera) sarai were the only that clearly inhibit the
growth of yeast expressing Patched in the presence of

dxr without significant effect in the absence of dxr. We
decided to focus our study on the methanolic fraction
obtained from Haliclona (Soestella) mucosa (Figure
2a) which significantly inhibited the resistance of yeast
expressing Patched to dxr with only a small effect on basal
yeast growth (in the absence of dxr) (Figure 2b). In order
to identify the compounds responsible for this bioactivity,
the methanolic fraction obtained from Haliclona
(Soestella) mucosa was purified by C18 preparative HPLC
to yield 9 peaks (P1-P9) (Supplementary Figure 1).
Compounds present in these collected peaks were added
singly to the yeast growth medium in the presence or
in the absence of dxr. Five of these peaks (namely P1,
P3, P4, P6 and P7) were shown to strongly inhibit the
resistance to dxr of yeast expressing Patched (Figure 2c).
The effects of P2 and P9 on yeast growth were lower,
and P8 had no effect. Surprisingly, peak P5 increased
yeast growth in the presence of dxr suggesting that this
compound enhances yeast resistance to dxr. Comparison
of the NMR data of these peaks with literature allowed
the identification of four compounds P3, P4, P6 and P7
and confirmed their purity (>95%) (Supplementary Figure
2), while the other peaks remained unidentified because
they were found as complex mixtures. The identified
compounds are meroterpenoids members of the panicein
family, namely panicein A hydroquinone (1, P7) [31],
panicein B2 (2, P6), panicein B3 (3, P4), and panicein

C (4, P3) [32] (Figure  3). Dose-responses of these
compounds on the growth of yeast expressing Patched in
the presence of dxr have been performed providing IC50
values of about 1 μM for 1, 2 μM for 2, 0.8 μM for 3 and
4.9 μM for 4 (Figure 4).

Panicein A hydroquinone increases the
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin on melanoma cells
An analysis extracted from Human Protein Atlas
website (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000185920PTCH1/cancer) shows that the protein Patched is
expressed in several cancers and in particular in melanoma,
which exhibit a strong expression of Patched and no
expression in healthy tissue (Supplementary Figure 3a).
Data from the cancer microarray database and web-based
data-mining platform ONCOMINE (https://www.oncomine.
org/) [33] indicate that Patched mRNAs are expressed in
biopsies from 83 melanoma samples over 154, both in
primary site and in metastasis (Supplementary Figure
3b). Therefore, two melanoma cell lines were chosen to
measure the effect of paniceins purified from Haliclona
(Soestella) mucosa on dxr cytotoxicity. The MEWO cell
line is derived from a melanoma metastatic site (lymph
node tissue), and the A375 cell line is derived from a
human malignant melanoma and carries the BRAFV600E
mutation. These two cell lines express the protein Patched

labeling (Supplementary Figure 3c).
Cells were treated separately with the four paniceins
1–4, with or without dxr, during 24 hours before cell
viability measurement (Figure 5). The average of
experiments indicated that compound 1 strongly increased
cell mortality induced by dxr on MEWO cells (5 to 8
times) and on A375 cells (2 to 3 times). Dose-responses
of Panicein A hydroquinone (1) on cell viability have
been performed providing IC50 values in the presence of
dxr of about 5 μM and 20 μM on MEWO and A375 cells
respectively, while in the absence of dxr, this molecule
was weakly cytotoxic with IC50 superior to 30 μM.

Flow cytometry experiments carried out using
Annexin V and DAPI labeling indicated that the addition
of 1 to dxr treatment significantly increased the percentage
of cells in apoptosis both for MEWO and A375 cells
(Figure 6). These data are in good agreement with the dxr

or degradation in these cells (Supplementary Figure
4). Then, we hypothesized that the effect of 1 on the
resistance and the cytotoxicity of dxr could be due to
the inhibition of Patched dxr efflux activity. We took
advantage of the natural fluorescence properties of dxr
[34] to carry out dxr efflux measurements. Melanoma
cells were loaded with dxr and fixed for loading
control or incubated with efflux buffer containing
DMSO (efflux control) or compound 1. Cells were
fixed after 30 min and analyzed using cell imaging
(Figure 7a). Fluorescence intensity quantification
showed that dxr intracellular concentration was
significantly higher (about 25%) when 1 was present
in the efflux buffer for both A375 and MEWO cells.
These results suggest that 1 inhibits dxr efflux from
these melanoma cells.
In order to demonstrate that compound 1 inhibits dxr
efflux by acting on Patched, we compared dxr efflux from
yeast expressing Patched and control yeast. 2-deoxy-Dglucose was added in buffer during dxr loading and efflux in
order to de-energize yeast and inhibit ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters which also contribute to dxr efflux in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

yeast. This enabled us to selectively study the dxr efflux
activity of Patched. Dxr fluorescence measured in yeast
expressing Patched after efflux in buffer containing DMSO
was significantly lower than that measured in control
yeast, consistently with the dxr efflux activity of Patched
already described [25] (Figure 7b). Dxr concentration of
yeast expressing Patched was significantly higher when 1
was present in the efflux buffer, unlike compounds 3 and
4 which exhibited no significant effect (Figure 7b). Results
analysis indicated that 1 inhibited about 40% of the dxr
efflux activity of Patched. None of these compounds have a
significant effect on the dxr fluorescence of control yeasts.
These results suggest that compound 1 is able to inhibit the
dxr efflux activity of Patched. This was confirmed using
yeast expressing a mutant of Patched: PatchedVXXXY.
We previously described that the drug efflux activity of
Patched was coupled to the proton motive force similarly
to the bacterial efflux pumps from the RND family [35].
The GXXXD motif that corresponds to the proton transfer
pathway in the RND bacterial drug efflux pumps is
highly conserved in the fourth putative transmembrane
segment of Patched [25, 36, 37]. We replaced glycine (G)

structure of this RND transporter. Among the numerous
AcrB structures present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB),
the highest resolution one obtained without darpin nor
substrate (PDB code 2GIF; [38]) was chosen as template
and the results were compared with the AcrB structure
in complex with dxr (PDB code: 2DR6; [39]). Those
structures consist of three protomers, each of which has a
different conformation corresponding to one of the three
functional states of the transport cycle. The dxr bound
substrate was found in the periplasmic domain of only one
of the three protomers. The voluminous binding pocket is
aromatic and allows multi-site binding. For binding of 4,
the analysis shows 79 distinct conformational clusters of
low probability, the largest population being as small as 3.
More interestingly, docking of 1 led to 41 conformational
clusters, the largest population attaining 16. This strong
probability cluster is localized close to the dxr binding
site, upstream of the dxr position relative to the entry of
the binding pocket (Figure 8c). As this binding pocket has
been modeled in Patched, the AcrB-1 and -4 clusters where
superposed on the Patched model (Figure 8d). It results
that 1 is predicted to interact with Patched in a similar

way as dxr binds to AcrB. Then it could be hypothesized
that dxr and panicein A hydroquinone could compete by
reaching similar binding sites in Patched. This is in good
agreement with the inhibition of dxr efflux observed in the
presence of panicein A hydroquinone.

some natural compounds isolated from the Mediterranean
sponge Haliclona (Soestella) mucosa inhibit the resistance
to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (dxr) conferred
to yeast by the expression of human Patched. Four of these
compounds have been identified as meroterpenoids named
paniceins, and correspond to panicein A hydroquinone (1),
panicein B2 (2), panicein B3 (3) and panicein C (4). We
observed that 1 strongly enhanced the dxr cytotoxicity on
melanoma cells and increased the number of apoptotic
cells in the presence of dxr, while this molecule showed
low cytotoxicity by itself. Dxr fluorescence quantification
performed on melanoma cells evinced that treatment
with 1 increased dxr intracellular concentration. Similar
experiments performed on yeast expressing Patched
showed that 1 inhibits the dxr efflux activity of Patched.
These data are supported by the fact that 1 has no effect
on yeast expressing a mutant of Patched which does not
transport dxr or on control yeast. The docking realized
on the structure of the E. coli drug efflux pump AcrB
and the structural model of Patched indicated that 1 has
a strong probability of interacting close to the dxr binding
site, suggesting that this molecule could prevent dxr
efflux. Our results suggest that 1 increases the cytotoxic
effect of dxr by inhibiting the efflux activity of Patched.
The four paniceins identified in our study have already
been assayed for cytotoxicity against tumoral cell lines
[31]. These molecules were shown to exhibit moderate
cytotoxicity above the micromolar range with 1 being the
most selective against CCRF-CEM leukemia cells (with
a growth inhibitory power (GI50) of 7.8 μM, a cytostatic
effect (TGI) of 25 μM and a cytotoxic effect (LC50) lees
than to 25 μM). These previous observations together with
our present results underline the therapeutical potential of
these compounds. The high reactivity of the hydroquinone
could hamper the direct use of paniceins as therapeutic
agents. However, other terpene quinones from marine
origin, e.g. avarol or ilimaquinone [50], have also been
shown to exhibit a wide range of interesting bioactivity.
In the case of paniceins, this is the first report of a strong
therapeutic potential. Moreover, due to the quite easy
access to organic synthesis of these molecules [51], slight
modifications of the hydroquinone could enhance the
bioactivity and interest of panicein analogues as therapeutic
agents. In a more general context, these studies underline
the importance to assess the biological effects of already
known natural substances on a large array of biological
targets and the key chemical features of marine natural
products [52].
Taken together, our results evidence that panicein A
hydroquinone (1) isolated from the Mediterranean sponge
Haliclona (Soestella) mucosa is the first inhibitor of the dxr
efflux activity of Patched. The increase of dxr cytotoxicity
induced by panicein A hydroquinone on two melanoma
cell lines provides evidence for the relevance of Patched as
a therapeutic target in a subset of melanoma, and suggests
that the use of inhibitors of Patched drug efflux activity

DISCUSSION
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a phenomenon of
resistance of tumors to chemically unrelated anticancer
drugs, and is one of the most formidable challenges in the
field of cancer chemotherapy [40, 41]. Multidrug resistance
can have many causes such as alterations in DNA repair,
defective regulation of apoptotic gene expression,
enhanced intracellular drug detoxification, but the most
common mechanism is the efflux of cytotoxic drugs by
membrane transporters. In human, most of the multidrug
transporters belong to the large ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter super family of membrane proteins
from which P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was the first member to
be identified [42–44]. Many inhibitors of P-gp have been
tested in clinical trials to assess their pharmacological
potential. Unfortunately, most of them have failed because
they displayed non-specific toxicity [45].
Emerging data from many human tumors have shown
that the chemotherapy-resistant phenotype of cancer cells
correlates with the activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling,
and that the Hh pathway regulates cancer stem cells or
tumor initiating cells [21, 22, 46, 47]. As an example, Hh
signaling is often activated in melanomas and might have
a critical role in determining the stem-like characteristics
of melanoma initiating cells, contributing to the acquisition
of a more undifferentiated and aggressive state through a
process similar to reprogramming [48, 49]. The Hh receptor
Patched being a Hh target gene, this membrane protein is
over-expressed in many recurrent and metastatic tumors
such as breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian, prostate cancers or
melanoma, as shown by the data extracted from the Human
Protein Atlas web site presented in Supplementary Figure
3. We recently discovered that Patched is a multidrug efflux
pump that transports different chemotherapeutic agents
out of cells, and particularly doxorubicin, using the proton
motive force like the bacterial multidrug efflux pumps from
the RND family [25]. This is a real breakthrough which
suggests that the Hh receptor Patched participates to the
resistance to chemotherapy of cancer cells, and allows
proposing Patched as a new target for anti-cancer therapy.
In contrast to ABC transporters such as P-gp which are
ubiquitously expressed, Patched is expressed in adults
more specifically in cancer cells. Therefore, inhibitors
of Patched drug efflux activity should display less nonspecific toxicity than P-gp inhibitors. We then designed
innovative screening tests to identify molecules able to
inhibit the drug efflux activity of Patched. Compounds
extracted from Mediterranean sponges are among the
chemical molecules screened to date. Our results show that

good approach to circumvent tumor drug resistance and to
increase cytotoxicity of chemotherapy toward cancer stem
cells and the corresponding differentiated tumor cells. This
multimodal strategy may represent a breakthrough and the
next challenge in cancer treatment.

to obtain an extract after concentration under reduced
pressure. This extract was fractionated by Solid Phase
Extraction (Strata® C18-E, 2 g, Phenomenex) with a step
gradient of H2O, MeOH and DCM (14 mL each).
To identify the compounds responsible for the
bioactivity, 40.3 g of the freeze-dried sponge Haliclona
(Soestella) mucosa was extracted with a mixture of
DCM/MeOH (1:1, v/v) (400 mL) during 15 min in an
ultrasonic bath and the supernatant was collected. This
step was repeated twice to finally give 5.6 g of extract after
concentration under reduced pressure. The extract was
fractionated by RP-C18 vacuum liquid chromatography
with solvents of decreasing polarity to obtain 5 fractions:
H2O (F1), H2O/MeOH 1:1 (F2), H2O/MeOH 1:3 (F3),
MeOH (F4) and DCM (F5) (500 mL each). Fraction F4
was purified by C18 preparative HPLC (19 mm × 250
mm × 5 μm, Xselect CSH from Waters) with an isocratic
elution with H2O/ACN/TFA (30:70:0.1) during 18 min
leading to 9 pure compounds P1 to P9 (Supplementary
Figure 1). Four of them were identified as panicein A
hydroquinone (1, P7, 13.0 mg), panicein B2 (2, P6, 5.50

lophyropoda sponge individuals (max 10 g wet weight)
were collected by hand using SCUBA diving in a cave at
Villefranche-sur-Mer (France) at depths ranging from 10
or 20 m, and kept frozen until used.
Human melanoma cell lines MEWO and A375 were
purchased from ATCC. The two cell lines were grown in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ mL
penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, at 37°C in a 5%
CO2/95% air water-saturated atmosphere.

were pre-cultured at 30°C in the same medium to OD600 =
1–2, and diluted in rich medium containing 2% of glucose
in 96-well plates. Methanolic or purified fractions were
dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/mL and added in all wells at
10 μg/mL (1/1000 dilution) or other final concentrations
(for IC50 measurements), doxorubicin (dxr) (10 μM final
concentration) was added in half of the wells. DMSO
at a dilution of 1/1000 corresponding to the amount of
DMSO added with sponge extracts or compounds was
added in the control wells. We checked that this amount
of DMSO had no effect on yeast growth in the absence or
in the presence of dxr (not shown). Plates were incubated
at 18°C on a shaker at 1250 rpm (microtitre plate shaker
SSL5 Stuart) and absorbance at 600 nm was recorded for
about 72 h. IC50 were calculated using online fit of logdose vs response from Graph Pad Prism software.

monoclonal mouse anti-βtubulin antibody (Sigma; 1/1000).
After 3 washes, membranes were incubated 45 min with
anti-mouse (1:5000) or anti-rabbit (1:3000) immunoglobulin
coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Dako). Detection was
carried out with an ECL kit (Millipore) on a Las3000 (Fuji).

Immuno-labelling
Cells were seeded on cover slips in 12-well plates
and allowed to grow to 80% confluence. Cells were
washed twice with PBS and fixed 10 min with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma) and then incubated in
PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween and 1% BSA for
1 h to permeabilize the cells and block non-specific
protein-protein interaction. Cells were then incubated
with anti-Patched antibody (Ab39266 from Abcam 1/200)
overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed with PBS/0.1%BSA
before incubation with the secondary antibody (Alexa
Fluor 494 goat anti-rabbit IgG, (red)) at 1/200 dilution for
1 h at RT. DAPI was used to stain the cell nuclei (blue).
Cells were observed by epifluorescence microscopy
(Axioplan2 imaging from Zeiss coupled to a cool SNAP
HQ from Roper Scientific) using an objective Plan
NeoFluar 40x /1.3.

Effect of sponges purified fractions on
doxorubicin cytotoxicity on melanoma cells
MEWO and A375 melanoma cells were seeded
on 96-well plates and grown 48 h in complete DMEM
medium to achieve 60% to 70% confluence. Medium was
then removed and replaced with 100 μL/well of complete
DMEM medium containing the compounds of interest at
defined concentration or DMSO as control. After 2 h, 100
μL of complete DMEM medium containing dxr was added
in half of the wells to obtain 2 or 1.5 μM dxr. 100 μL of
complete DMEM medium without dxr was added in the
other half of the plate. Plates were incubated at 37°C in a
5% CO2/95% air water-saturated atmosphere. After 24 h,
plates were incubated 3 h at 37°C with 100 μL/ wells of
neutral red (NR) solution (50 μg/mL in DMEM). After
a rapid wash with cold PBS, plates were gently tapped
several times on absorbent paper. Cells were solubilized
with 100 μL of a solution containing 1% acetic acid, 49%
H2O, 50% ethanol by vortexing 3 min at 700 rpm and the
absorbance at 600 nm was measured. IC50 were calculated
from the mean of at least three experiments for each cell
line using online fit of log-dose vs response from Graph
Pad Prism software.

Drug efflux measurements
For dxr incorporation in melanoma cells, the
protocol was adapted from Bidet et al. [25]. Cells were
seeded on cover slips in 12-well plates and allowed to
grow to 80% confluence. Cover slips were incubated 2 h
at 37°C and 5% CO2 with 10 μM of dxr in physiological
buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM
MgSO4, 5 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) protected
from light and quickly rinsed with phosphate buffer (pH
7.4). One cover slip of each cell line was immediately
fixed 10 min with 4% PFA for dxr loading control. The
other cover slips were incubated with physiological buffer
supplemented with DMSO or 10 μM of paniceins 30 min
under gentle shaking at 37°C and 5% CO2 protected from
light, and immediately fixed with 4% PFA. Cells were
observed by epi-fluorescence microscopy (λex: 485 nm,
λem: 600 nm) (Axioplan2 imaging from Zeiss coupled to a
cool SNAP HQ from Roper Scientific) using an objective
Plan NeoFluar 40x /1.3.
For dxr incorporation in yeast, yeast expressing
Patched, mutant Patched (PatchedVXXXY), or control
yeast were washed with cold water, resuspended at an
OD600 of 10 in Hepes–NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) supplemented
with 5 mM of 2-deoxy-D-glucose to inhibit glycolysis and
de-energize yeast, and incubated with 10 μM dxr for 2 h
at 4°C in the cold room on a rotating wheel in the dark.
Yeasts were centrifuged and the supernatant was removed.
One sample was immediately fixed with 4% PFA for dxr
loading control. The other samples were resuspended
in Hepes–NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mM of
2-deoxy-D-glucose supplemented with DMSO or 10 μM

Protein quantification
Protein concentrations were determined by the
Bradford method using a Bio-Rad kit.

SDS-PAGE and western-blotting
Total RIPA extracts from melanoma cells were
prepared. Samples were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham) using
standard techniques. After 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in
blocking buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 45 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.1%Tween-20, and 4% non-fat milk), nitrocellulose
membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit
anti-Patched antiserum (Ab39266 from Abcam 1/1000) and

of paniceins, and incubated 10 min at 25°C with gentle
shaking in a Benchmark Multi-therm shake protected from
light. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 18, 000 g,
supernatants were removed and yeast were fixed with 4%
PFA. 10 μL of each sample were deposited on a cover slip
and observed by epi-fluorescence microscopy (λex: 485
nm, λem: 600 nm) using an objective Plan NeoFluar 63x
/0.7–1.25 Iris.
Quantification of dxr intracellular fluorescence was
carried out using Image J software on more than 30 cells
or yeasts from 3 different fields for each condition. The
results were analyzed using the Student t-test in which
significance is attained at P < 0.05.

then run MODELLER (https://salilab.org/modeller/) [58]
for model building. Concerning Phyre2 and I-TASSER,
the two programs were used without manual intervention
nor geometry refinement.
These different trials for Patched model building
revealed mainly membrane protein transporters from
the RND family (AcrB, MexB, CusA) but some other
unrelated protein structures were also suggested that
differed between the three programs results (like for
example an helicase (PDB code 4F91; [59]), or the
translocon-associated membrane protein SecDF (PDB
code 3AQP; [60]). Even if the three different programs
were mainly used with the automatic procedures, each
possible resulting model was analyzed, and all those with
low sequence coverage and/or percentage of identity with
the target used lower than 10% were omitted. In addition
it was verified that the location of the transmembrane
segments was compatible with the prediction of TM
performed by HMMTOP (http://www.enzim. hu/
hmmtop/), TOPPRED (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/
portal.py?#forms::toppred) and TMHMM (http://www.
cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), and that the GXXXD
motif corresponding to the proton transfer sequence was
localized in a transmembrane segment. It has also been
verified that the sequence duplication of human Patched
corresponds to structure duplication in the model.
The use of several programs for cross validation was
motivated by the low sequence identities between human
Patched and the proteins used in the model building, 17%
with CusA, 18% with AcrB (36% of sequence similarity),
18.4% with MexB, 19% with Czca, 16% with Mtrd, all
pertaining to the RND proteins family. Even if those
values are not high, it has to be noticed that for example
the sequence identity between AcrB and CusA that share
the same structure (RMSD = 4.2Å on 823 aligned Cα
atoms), is only 21%. Even if differences exist between the
models issued from the different programs, especially in
the extracellular domain, they all model the same portion
of Patched sequence, from 94 to 1183. The transmembrane
region is the most conserved one; in particular the
sequence 509GVGVD513, corresponding to the proton
transfer pathway, is perfectly aligned in all the models
(Figure 8a). A separate analysis of the N- and C-terminal
domains of Patched was performed with PONDR
[61] predicting those two domains as being mainly
disordered. The final Patched model, corresponding to
the second model proposed by I-Tasser, results mainly
from the structure of AcrB as evidenced from structural
superposition (Figure 8b).

Apoptosis measurement
Apoptosis measurements were carried out using
Annexin V conjugated to allophycocyanin (APC) (BD
Pharmingen) and DAPI labeling. Cells were cultivated
in 6 well-plates to 50% confluence, and treated or not
with paniceins and/or dxr for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and dissociated
by incubation with PBS containing 2% EDTA 5 to 10
min at 37°C and 5% CO2. After centrifugation, cells were
resuspended with 100 μl of Annexin V binding buffer (BD
Pharmingen) and incubated with 2.5 μL of APC Annexin
V and/or 3 μL of DAPI (5 mg/mL) 15 min at 25°C in the
dark. 100 to 200 μl of binding buffer was added to each
tube and flow cytometry analysis was carried out within
1 h using a LSR II Fortessa de BD (BD Biosciences). The
untreated population was used to define the basal level of
apoptotic and dead cells. The percentage of cells that have
been induced to undergo apoptosis was then determined
by subtracting the percentage of apoptotic cells in the
untreated population from percentage of apoptotic cells in
the treated population. Cells in the late stages of apoptosis
have a damaged membrane and stain positive for DAPI as
well as for APC Annexin V.

Patched 3D model
Three-dimensional models of Patched were
designed by using three different programs: the web
modeling pipeline @TOME-2 (http://atome.cbs.cnrs.fr/
AT2B/meta.html [53], Phyre2 (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.
uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index [54] and I-TASSER
(http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [55,
56], the winner of the last CASP competitions (Critical
Assesment for Structural Prediction) [57]. For the @
TOME-2 model building, the first step consists in a foldrecognition search and issues with a sequence alignment
with proteins whose structures have been solved and
deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB: http://www.
rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). A careful analysis of this
sequence alignment is then performed, leading to the
removing of several protein structures from the data to be
used for the second step. The second module of @TOME

Docking
The docking of two panicein molecules (1 and 4) on
the 2.9 Å resolution AcrB structure (PDB code 2GIF; [38])
was performed using AutoDock [62]. For each molecule
seven active torsions were chosen. Several runs were
performed using a grid search of 126 points in each direction
22294

Oncotarget

with a grid spacing of 0.44 Å, localized on one of the three
monomers forming the functional trimeric AcrB unit, the
one in the loose state permitting the entry of molecules in
the groove. For each calculation, 100 genetic algorithm runs
were performed with a population size of 150. The docking
of 4 on AcrB led to 79 distinct conformational clusters, the
largest population being as small as 3. For docking of 1, 41
conformational clusters were found out of the 100 runs, the
largest population attaining 16. This cluster of 16 ranks at
the 4th lowest binding energy level, but close to the first one
that is only composed of 3 different poses.
