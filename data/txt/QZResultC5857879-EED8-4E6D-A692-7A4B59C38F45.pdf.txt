Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In glioblastoma (GBM), the EGF receptor (EGFR) and Src family kinases (SFKs) contribute to an
aggressive phenotype. EGFR may be targeted therapeutically; however, resistance to EGFRtargeting drugs such as Erlotinib and Gefitinib develops quickly. In many GBMs, a truncated form
of the EGFR (EGFRvIII) is expressed. Although EGFRvIII is constitutively active and promotes
cancer progression, its activity is attenuated compared with EGF-ligated wild-type EGFR,
suggesting that EGFRvIII may function together with other signaling receptors in cancer cells to
induce an aggressive phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM
cells, the urokinase receptor (uPAR) functions as a major activator of SFKs, controlling
phosphorylation of downstream targets such as p130Cas and Tyr-845 in the EGFR in vitro and in
vivo. When EGFRvIII expression in GBM cells was neutralized, either genetically or by treating
the cells with Gefitinib, paradoxically, the cells demonstrated increased cell migration. The
increase in cell migration was explained by a compensatory increase in expression of urokinasetype plasminogen activator, which activates uPAR-dependent cell-signaling. GBM cells that were
selected for their ability to grow in vivo in the absence of EGFRvIII also demonstrated increased
cell migration, due to activation of the uPAR signaling system. The increase in GBM cell
migration, induced by genetic or pharmacologic targeting of the EGFR, was blocked by Dasatinib,
highlighting the central role of SFKs in uPAR-promoted cell migration. These results suggest that
compensatory activation of uPAR-dependent cell-signaling, in GBM cells treated with targeted
therapeutics, may adversely affect the course of the disease by promoting cell migration, which
may be associated with tumor progression.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a typically lethal malignancy in which c-Src and other members of
the Src family kinase (SFK) gene family are frequently highly activated, contributing to
tumor aggressiveness.1–4 SFKs are non-receptor tyrosine kinases with broad regulatory
activity in cell survival, proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis.5,6 SFKs function
independently and in conjunction with receptors in the plasma membrane, including receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs), integrins, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and the
erythropoietin receptor, to activate downstream cell-signaling pathways that include the RasERK1/2 pathway, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR1 pathway, and the Tiam1-Rac1 pathway.5–11 By
phosphorylating Tyr-845 in the activated EGF receptor (EGFR), SFKs promote activation of
the transcription factor, STAT5b, which supports cancer cell proliferation and survival.12–16
Phospho-Tyr-845 also binds cytochrome C oxidase subunit II, which may be involved in
cancer cell survival when the EGFR translocates to mitochondria.17

Author Manuscript

A second gene product that plays a central role in GBM pathogenesis is the EGF receptor
(EGFR), which is frequently amplified or over-expressed and in many cases, may be
truncated to form a constitutively active mutant called EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII).18–21
Although EGFRvIII expression promotes an aggressive phenotype in GBM cells, the
catalytic activity of EGFRvIII is attenuated compared with EGF-ligated wild-type (wt)
EGFR.22 Thus, EGFRvIII may require novel interactions with other receptors and cellsignaling proteins to most robustly affect cancer cell physiology.

Author Manuscript

We previously demonstrated that in GBM cells, phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in EGFRvIII is
dependent on the urokinase receptor (uPAR),15 a GPI-anchored membrane protein that
interacts with integrins, FPR-like receptor-1 (FPRL1), and various RTKs to form a
multiprotein complex with potent cell-signaling activity.23 The role of uPAR in
phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in EGFRvIII may reflect a physical interaction between uPAR
and EGFRvIII that increases availability of Tyr-845, as has been reported previously for
uPAR and wt-EGFR.24 Alternatively, in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells, uPAR may
control SFK activity in general. We and others have shown that SFKs play an essential role
in the cell-signaling pathways by which uPAR promotes cell survival and stimulates cell
migration;25–29 however, the importance of uPAR in controlling SFK activation in
comparison with other receptors has not been explored. This problem is particularly
important in GBM because SFKs are activated by numerous RTKs implicated in GBM
progression, including wt-EGFR and EGFRvIII.1,30,31
In this study, first we examined the role of uPAR in activation of SFKs in GBM cells by
measuring phosphorylation of Tyr-416, which reports the fully activated form of SFKs,32
and two SFK substrates, Tyr-845 in the EGFR and p130Cas. Our results demonstrate that in
EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells and in cells in which EGFRvIII expression was
neutralized, uPAR functions as a general activator of SFKs, affecting substrates in addition

to EGFR Tyr-845. Next, we examined the effects of EGFRvIII neutralization on GBM cell
migration. We previously demonstrated that reversing EGFRvIII gene expression in GBM
cells, in vitro or in vivo, induces expression of increased levels of urokinase typeplasminogen activator (uPA), stimulating uPAR-dependent cell-signaling and promoting cell
survival.15 We now report that blocking EGFRvIII gene expression paradoxically promotes
cell migration. This response was entirely attributable to activation of the uPA-uPAR
signaling system. Similarly, EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells that were treated with the
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), Gefitinib, demonstrated increased uPA expression
and accelerated cell migration. Gefitinib has been evaluated in clinical trials for GBM.33,34
We propose that signaling systems, which are activated as a compensatory response to
support cancer cell survival, may also stimulate processes such as cell migration, involved in
cancer progression. Importantly, the uPA-dependent increase in GBM cell migration that
accompanied EGFRvIII blockade was reversed by the SFK-targeting cancer therapeutic,
Dasatinib.4,35,36

Results
uPAR controls SFK activation in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells
To compare the role of EGFRvIII and uPAR in SFK activation, first EGFRvIII was
expressed in U373MG GBM cells. Fig. 1A shows that U373MG parental cells express low
levels of wt-EGFR and that EGFRvIII is robustly expressed in transduced cells. The
mobility of EGFRvIII is slightly increased compared with wt-EGFR due to receptor
truncation.37 When SDS-PAGE was conducted for an extended time, to allow resolution of
the bands for wt-EGFR and EGFRvIII, expression of wt-EGFR did not appear to be
regulated by EGFRvIII (results not shown).

We previously reported that uPAR gene-silencing decreases phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in
EGFRvIII in U373MG cells.15 Tyr-845 is a well described SFK substrate.12,38 Fig. 1B
confirms our original result, showing that Tyr-845 phosphorylation in EGFRvIII is
substantially decreased by uPAR gene-silencing. To test whether the decrease in phosphoTyr-845 reflects decreased SFK activity, or a distinct mechanism, such as altered availability
of the substrate, first we examined phosphorylation of SFK Tyr-416, which was decreased
by uPAR gene-silencing. Tyr-416 is known to be phosphorylated in maximally activated
SFKs; however, active forms of SFKs also exist in which Tyr-416 is not
phosphorylated.6,32,39 We therefore examined phosphorylation of a second SFK substrate,
p130Cas, and demonstrated that uPAR gene-silencing decreases phospho-p130Cas as well.
The total level of SFKs remained approximately unchanged in uPAR gene-silenced cells.
Although in EGFRvIII-expressing U373MG cells, uPAR gene-silencing most substantially
affected Tyr-845 phosphorylation, the effects on phosphorylation of Tyr-416 in SFKs and
p130Cas suggest that uPAR functions as an general SFK activator in these cells, even
though EGFRvIII expresses constitutive activity and also activates SFKs.1,30,31
To test the role of uPAR in SFK activation in a second model system, we expressed
EGFRvIII in U87MG GBM cells. Fig. 1C shows that EGFRvIII was robustly expressed in
these cells. Again in U87MG cells, EGFRvIII did not have an apparent effect on wt-EGFR
expression, as determined by immunoblot analysis when the time of SDS-PAGE was

extended. uPAR gene-silencing reduced phosphorylation of SFK Tyr-416 in EGFRvIIIexpressing U87MG cells and phosphorylation of the SFK substrates: EGFR Tyr-845 and
p130Cas, without having a major effect on the total level of SFKs (Fig. 1D). In the U87MG
model system, the effects of uPAR gene-silencing on phosphorylation of SFK Tyr-416,
EGFRvIII Tyr-845, and p130Cas were similar in magnitude. Thus, again in this cell line,
uPAR functions as a general regulator of SFK activation. The previously reported activity of
uPAR in controlling phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in EGFRvIII15 probably reflects, at least in
part, the general activity of uPAR in SFK activation in EGFRvIII-expressing cells, although
a direct interaction between uPAR and EGFRvIII cannot be ruled out by the studies
presented here.

Author Manuscript

Because the U373MG and U87MG cell lines express low levels of wild-type EGFR, as a
control, we tested whether EGF treatment affects SFK activation in EGFRvIII-expressing
U87MG cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, phospho-Tyr-416, phospho-Tyr-845, and phosphop130Cas were unchanged in cells that were treated with 2 ng/ml EGF for 10 min.
Comparison of SFK activation in wt-EGFR and EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells
EGFRvIII is constitutively active despite its inability to bind EGF; however, the catalytic
activity of EGFRvIII is substantially decreased compared with EGF-ligated wt-EGFR.22,37
To compare the role of uPAR in SFK activation in wt-EGFR- and EGFRvIII-expressing
cells, U87MG cells were transduced to over-express wt-EGFR. Fig. 1E shows that EGF
increased phosphorylation of Tyr-416 in SFKs in wt-EGFR over-expressing cells; however,
uPAR gene-silencing decreased phospho-Tyr-416 both before and after EGF treatment.
Thus, uPAR plays a role controlling SFK activation in GBM cells that express EGFRvIII or
wt-EGFR.

Author Manuscript

To further compare the activity of uPAR in controlling SFK activity in wt-EGFR- and
EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells, we performed affinity precipitation experiments with a
GST fusion protein that contains the SH2 domain of c-Src (GST-SH2). This fusion protein
binds phospho-Tyr residues, which in the EGFR, may be generated by auto-phosphorylation
or through the activity of SFKs.5,6,12 In EGFRvIII-expressing U87MG cells, EGFRvIII
readily affinity-precipitated with GST-SH2; however, when uPAR was silenced, EGFRvIII
precipitation with GST-SH2 was substantially decreased (Fig. 2A). These results suggest a
major role for uPAR, and by extension, SFKs, in generating the phospho-Tyr residues that
serve as SH2-binding sites in EGFRvIII in U87MG cells.

Author Manuscript

In U87MG cells that over-express wt-EGFR, only low levels of EGFR affinity-precipitated
with GST-SH2 unless the cells were pre-treated with EGF (Fig. 2A). Following EGF pretreatment, affinity precipitation of wt-EGFR with GST-SH2 was robust and uPAR genesilencing did not affect this result, most likely reflecting the greatly increased capacity of
EGF-ligated wt-EGFR to induce auto-phosphorylation.22 We confirmed the relationship
between uPAR and EGFRvIII phosphorylation in U373MG GBM cells. uPAR genesilencing almost entirely blocked affinity precipitation of EGFRvIII with GST-SH2 in
U373MG cells (Fig. 2B). This result was not affected by EGF pre-treatment, as anticipated
because EGFRvIII does not bind EGF.37

The results presented here demonstrate that the previously reported relationship between
uPAR expression and phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in EGFRvIII in GBM cells may represent
one component of a more general phenomenon in which uPAR plays a major role regulating
SFK activation. To determine whether this relationship exists in vivo, we examined the
EGFRvIII-expressing human GBM, GBM39, which has been propagated as a xenograft in
mice.40 Tumor tissue was recovered from mice and analyzed by quantum dot
immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. This method allows precise quantitation of uPAR
antigen expression and phospho-Tyr-845 at the single-cell level.41 Representative IF
micrographs showed that uPAR expression and phospho-Tyr-845 varied from cell to cell
(Fig. 3A). uPAR and phospho-Tyr-845 co-localized in the plasma membranes of many cells.
Well-defined cells were identified and relative antigen levels were determined using Nuance
Multispectral Imaging System software. The quantitative analysis of antigen intensity is
shown in Fig. 3B. As predicted by our in vitro studies, there was a tight correlation between
uPAR expression and phospho-Tyr-845 (R2= 0.87) in vivo, at the single cell level, in human
GBM tissue.
Control of SFK activation when EGFRvIII expression is blocked in GBM

Author Manuscript

We previously described a model system in which EGFRvIII is expressed under the control
of a doxycycline (Dox) repressible promoter in U373MG GBM cells.42 When EGFRvIII
expression is neutralized by culturing the cells in the presence of Dox for at least 4 days,
uPA expression is increased, activating compensatory uPAR-dependent pro-survival cellsignaling.15 Fig. 4A compares cells that were Dox-treated and control cells by immunoblot
analysis. EGFRvIII expression was essentially absent in the Dox-treated cells, revealing a
residual lower mobility band corresponding to wt-EGFR, which is expressed at low levels in
these cells. When we analyzed serum-free medium (SFM), which was conditioned by the
cells for 48 h, the amount of uPA recovered from Dox-treated cells was substantially
increased. qPCR analysis confirmed that in Dox-treated cells, uPA expression was increased
at the mRNA level (p<0.05).
To study the role of uPAR in SFK activation when EGFRvIII expression is neutralized, we
silenced uPAR in control and Dox-treated cells. Supplementary Fig. 1A shows that uPAR
gene silencing was 95% effective. The cells were allowed to recover for 12 h and then
cultured in SFM for 36 h (with continued Dox or vehicle treatment). Fig. 4B shows that SFK
phospho-Tyr-416 was decreased by uPAR gene-silencing in EGFRvIII-deficient Doxtreated cells, indicating that uPAR plays a significant role in maintaining SFK activation
when EGFRvIII is neutralized in GBM cells.

Escaper (ESC) cell lines were derived from xenografts formed by U373MG GBM cells that
express Dox-repressible EGFRvIII.42 These cells require EGFRvIII expression at the time of
inoculation in order to form tumors in immunocompromised mice. When EGFRvIII
expression was blocked in established tumors by treating the mice with Dox, the tumors
entered a temporary state of dormancy and then, released from dormancy, re-establishing
aggressive growth. ESC cell lines were established from tumor cells that released from
dormancy.42 We previously demonstrated that ESC cell lines secrete substantially increased
levels of uPA compared with parental cells. The uPA activates uPAR-dependent cell-

signaling and may explain the ability of ESC cells to release from dormancy.15 Fig. 4C
shows that EGFR mRNA expression was substantially decreased in three separate ESC cell
lines, compared with the EGFRvIII-expressing parental cells from which the ESC cells were
derived (p<0.01), as anticipated. The ESC cells also expressed increased levels of uPA
mRNA, compared with parental cells (p<0.05).
To explore the role of uPAR in SFK activation in ESC cells, we silenced uPAR in the ESC1,
ESC2, and ESC5 cells. Supplementary Fig. 1B shows that uPAR gene silencing was >95
effective in all three cell lines. Next, we examined activation of SFKs in the control and
uPAR gene-silenced cells by performing immunoblot analysis to detect phospho-Tyr-416. In
each of the ESC cell lines, uPAR gene-silencing decreased phospho-Tyr-416 (Fig. 4D),
indicating a role for uPAR in controlling SFK activation in tumor cells that acquire
resistance to EGFR deficiency in vivo.

EGFRvIII neutralization in GBM cells promotes cell migration

Author Manuscript

Dox-treatment to block EGFRvIII expression in U373MG cells provides a model of changes
that may occur in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells when tumors are treated with TKIs such
as Erlotinib and Gefitinib.42 Because uPAR activates potent pro-migratory cell-signaling
factors, such as Rac1 and ERK1/2,27,28,43–46 we used the Dox-repressible EGFRvIII
expression model to study the effects of EGFRvIII neutralization on cell migration. Cells
were treated with Dox or vehicle and transfected with uPAR-specific or NTC siRNA.
Representative images of cells that migrated to the underside of Transwell membranes are
shown in Fig. 5A. Neutralization of EGFRvIII expression was associated with a 2.3 ± 0.4fold increase in cell migration (p<0.05) (Fig. 5B). uPAR gene-silencing blocked the increase
in cell migration observed in Dox-treated cells. When uPAR was silenced, Dox-treated and
control cells migrated equivalently.

Author Manuscript

Next, we examined ESC cells, in which EGFRvIII deficiency was induced in vivo.42 All
three ESC cell lines (ESC1, ESC2, ESC5) demonstrated significantly increased cell
migration compared with EGFRvIII-expressing U373MG cells, from which the ESC cells
were derived (Fig. 5C). Although uPAR-initiated cell-signaling occurs in the presence and
absence of uPA, the full potential of uPAR in cell-signaling requires uPA.23,43,46,47 Thus,
we tested whether uPA gene-silencing affects migration of EGFRvIII-expressing and –
deficient U373MG cells and ESC cells. As shown in Fig. 5C, uPA gene-silencing
completely blocked the increase in cell migration observed when EGFRvIII expression was
neutralized by treating U373MG cells with Dox in vitro. uPA gene-silencing also
substantially inhibited migration of the ESC cells, effectively neutralizing any advantage in
cell migration compared with the parental cells. Supplementary Fig. 2 confirms that uPA
gene-silencing was >95% effective in the three ESC cell lines.
To complement our model system in which EGFRvIII gene expression was neutralized
genetically, we treated EGFRvIII-expressing U373MG cells with 1.0 µM Gefitinib for 4
days. Control cells were treated with vehicle. At the conclusion of the incubation, uPA
mRNA expression was increased 4.9 ± 1.1-fold (p<0.05) in the Gefitinib-treated cells (Fig.
5D). This is the first report demonstrating increased uPA expression induced by Gefitinib in
GBM cells. The increase in uPA expression was accompanied by a 1.7-fold increase in cell

migration (p<0.05) (Fig. 5E). To assess the role of uPA in migration of Gefitinib-treated
U373MG cells, we transfected EGFRvIII-expressing cells with uPA-specific or NTC
siRNA. uPA gene-silencing had a modest effect on migration of the control cells; however,
in the Gefitinib-treated cells, a more robust effect was observed. uPA gene-silencing
inhibited migration of Gefitinib-treated cells by 66 ± 3% (p<0.01). The control and
Gefitinib-treated cells migrated equivalently when uPA was not available.
Targeting SFKs blocks the increase in cell migration associated with activation of the uPAuPAR system in GBM cells

Author Manuscript

Given the reported role of SFKs as upstream mediators of uPAR-initiated cell-signaling to
ERK1/2 and Rac1,25–28 we tested whether the anticancer drug, Dasatinib, which targets
SFKs, inhibits migration of cells in which EGFRvIII is neutralized. Fig. 6A shows that
treatment with 0.3 µM Dasatinib for 4 h almost entirely blocked activation of SFKs, as
determined by measuring phosphorylation of SFK Tyr-416 in U373MG cells that express
EGFRvIII (not treated with Dox) and in U373MG cells that were EGFRvIII-deficient (Dox
treated). Dasatinib was extremely effective at inhibiting U373MG cell migration, especially
when EGFRvIII expression was neutralized and cell migration stimulated by uPA (Fig. 6B).
Under these conditions, inhibition of cell migration was greater than 80% complete.
Next we examined the effects of Dasatinib on migration of ESC cells. Fig. 6C shows that
treatment with 0.3 µM Dasatinib for 4 h blocked SFK activation in each of the three ESC
cell lines, as determined by measuring SFK phospho-Tyr-416 and phospho-p130Cas. Fig.
6D shows that Dasatinib inhibited migration of the ESC cells by 80–90% (p<0.01). These
results suggest that Dasatinib, which is used in human patients, may effectively antagonize
the uPAR signaling system and its effects on cell migration.

Author Manuscript

An equivalent response was observed in Dasatinib treatment experiments when we studied
cells that were pre-treated for 4 days with Gefitinib. Cells that were treated with Gefitinib
migrated more rapidly (p<0.05), confirming the results presented in Fig. 5E (Fig. 6E).
Including Dasatinib in the Transwell chambers inhibited migration of the control cells by
about 75% and migration of the Gefitinib-treated cells by close to 90%. Thus, in all of our
model systems, targeting SFKs blocked the increase in cell migration associated with
EGFRvIII neutralization and activation of the uPAR signaling system.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

EGFRvIII induces an aggressive phenotype in GBM cells, despite its attenuated activity
compared with EGF-ligated wt-EGFR.18,22,37,48–50 Cells that express EGFRvIII may make
neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment more aggressive,48,51 so even a small
population of EGFRvIII-positive cells in a GBM may significantly promote tumor
progression. Given these properties, it was rational to test the efficacy of EGFR-selective
TKIs, such as Gefitinib and Erlotinib, in EGFRvIII-positive GBM. Unfortunately, treated
tumors rapidly escape from control, re-establishing aggressive growth and invasion within a
short time.52 Failure of EGFR TKIs to induce sustained remission may reflect emergence of
novel genomic alterations, activation of signaling systems that replace EGFRvIII, and/or
selection of subpopulations of cancer cells that are drug-resistant. One known cause of

resistance to EGFR TKIs is mutation in PTEN, which sustains activation of signaling
pathways that are downstream of the EGFR.40,48,52 We identified the uPA-uPAR system as
one that may allow GBM cells to escape from control by EGFR TKIs.15

Author Manuscript

The hypothesis that activation of uPAR-initiated cell-signaling may compensate for loss of
EGFR activity in GBM is supported by previous studies that have demonstrated substantial
overlap in key downstream targets for uPAR and the EGFR, including ERK1/2, the PI3KAkt pathway, and Rac1 (Fig. 7).27–29,43–45,47,53–55 These common downstream targets
support cell survival; however, the same signaling factors also play key roles in cell
migration and in cancer cells, invasion and metastasis.27–29,46,47,54 Fig. 7 shows that uPAR
is a member of a multi-protein signaling receptor complex, which may include different
RTKs including the EGFR, the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) FPRL1, and integrins
such as α5β1 and α4β1.23,24,56–59 Because SFKs associate with integrin cytoplasmic tails, the
central role of SFKs in uPAR-initiated signaling may reflect a complex in which uPAR is
bridged to SFKs through integrins; however, SFKs also are important effectors of RTK
signaling and GPCR signaling.5–11,55
In this study, we demonstrated that uPAR is a major activator of SFKs in EGFRvIIIexpressing GBM cells. The effects of uPAR on SFK activation provide an explanation for
the previously reported role of uPAR in Tyr-845 phosphorylation in EGFRvIII.15 uPAR also
promoted phosphorylation of the SFK substrate, p130Cas. In a human GBM propagated as a
xenograft, the extent of phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in EGFRvIII correlated with uPAR
immunopositivity at the single cell level. SFK activation is a known determinant of GBM
cell aggressiveness.1–4 Cooperation between EGFRvIII and uPAR may explain the cancerpromoting activity of EGFRvIII in GBM cells, despite its attenuated enzymatic activity.22,37

Author Manuscript

In diverse forms of neoplasia, uPAR-initiated cell-signaling is known to prevent apoptosis
and anoikis and release cancer cells from states of dormancy.56,61–63 Thus, it is not
surprising that activation of uPAR-initiated cell-signaling compensates for neutralization of
EGFRvIII in GBM cells.15 Other compensatory cell-signaling systems have been described,
which also may promote GBM survival and growth following EGFR TKI treatment.52 In
our model systems, when EGFRvIII was neutralized, uPAR remained an important activator
of SFKs; however, the decrease in SFK activation induced by uPAR gene-silencing was
incomplete, suggesting that, in these cells, SFKs may be activated by proximal receptors
other than EGFRvIII and in addition to uPAR.

Author Manuscript

uPAR promotes cell migration by two major mechanisms.23,57 By binding and promoting
activation of uPA as a protease at the cancer cell surface, uPAR assembles a cell-surface
protease system, which may aid in the degradation of tissue boundaries for the migrating
cancer cell.22,57–59,64 uPAR also promotes cell migration by its effects on pro-migratory
cell-signaling factors, such as Rac1 and ERK1/2.27–29,43–45,47,53–55 Because uPA was
expressed at increased levels in GBM cells when EGFRvIII was genetically neutralized or
when the cells were treated with Gefitinib, we explored the effects of these treatments on
GBM cell migration. The Transwell cell migration method applied in this study does not
incorporate tissue boundaries and thus, is more sensitive to changes in cell-signaling, as
opposed to effects on cell-surface protease activity. In GBM cells in which EGFRvIII

expression was blocked in vitro, in ESC cells in which EGFRvIII expression was blocked in
vivo, and in cells treated with Gefitinib, increased cell migration was observed and the
increase was entirely attributed to the uPA-uPAR signaling system. Silencing of uPA or
uPAR blocked the increase in cell migration associated with EGFRvIII inactivation. These
results provide an example of an important principle in cancer biology, relevant to uPAR.
The cell-signaling systems activated downstream of uPAR to promote cell survival are
overlapping with those that promote cancer cell migration.23,61 The increase in uPA
expression and activation of uPAR signaling probably represents a cellular response to the
stress imposed by loss of constitutive EGFRvIII signaling. uPAR-signaling provides
resistance to the negative consequences of EGFRvIII neutralization and allows the cells to
survive. Increased cell migration is a potentially important side-effect of activation of this
pro-survival signaling system.

Author Manuscript

Parker et al.65 recently reported that Gefitinib selectively inhibits migration of GBM cells in
which the EGFR gene is amplified. Although these investigators did not specifically study
EGFRvIII, the more important difference between the study reported by Parker et al.65 and
this investigation probably involves the methods applied. The tissue slice approach used by
Parker et al.,65 although elegant, did not provide a sufficiently long exposure of the cells to
Gefitinib to allow activation of compensatory signaling pathways, like the uPA-uPAR
system. Understanding the mechanisms by which uPA expression is up-regulated in cells in
which EGFRvIII is neutralized is an important topic for future investigation.

Author Manuscript

GBM is typically lethal due to local invasion as opposed to metastasis.48 Although the
capacity for cancer cell migration correlates with the capacity for invasion in vivo, further
work will be necessary to understand how the uPAR cell-signaling system affects GBM
invasion in vivo, in new tumors and in treated malignancies. A number of strategies for
specifically targeting uPAR in cancer are currently under development.66 If uPAR-initiated
cell-signaling allows tumor cells to escape from control by EGFR TKIs in patients with
GBM and promotes more rapid tumor spreading through the CNS, our results suggest that
the responsible signaling pathways may be antagonized by Dasatinib. In our model systems,
Dasatinib blocked migration of GBM cells by as much as 90%, after EGFRvIII expression
was inhibited or its activity antagonized. The possibility that targeting SFKs may represent
an alternative to direct targeting of uPAR is supported by our model in which SFKs function
as proximal signaling factors, linking receptors in the uPAR cell-signaling system to key
downstream signaling factors (Fig.7).

and U373MG cells that express wt-EGFR, are previously described.42 Escaper tumor cell
lines (ESC1, ESC2, ESC5), which were derived from U373MG cell xenografts that reestablished growth following loss of EGFRvIII in vivo, also are previously described.42
These cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% tetracycline-approved fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Clontech), Dox (1 µg/mL), puromycin (1 µg/mL), and Geneticin (200

µg/mL). U87MG cells that express EGFRvIII or over-express wt-EGFR are previously
described.37
Antibodies and reagents

Author Manuscript

Antibody that detects phospho-Tyr-416 in c-Src and cross-reacts with the equivalent epitope
in other SFKs was from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies specific for the
phosphorylated form of p130Cas (phopho-Tyr-410) and total ERK1/2 also were from Cell
Signaling Technology. Antibody that detects phospho-Tyr-845 in the EGFR was from
Invitrogen. Antibody that detects uPA was from American Diagnostica and antibody that
detects total EGFR was from Millipore. Human uPAR-specific antibody was from R&D
Systems. Horseradish peroxide-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG were from
GE Healthcare. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reagents, including primers and probes for uPA,
uPAR, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT-1) were from Applied
Biosystems. EGF was from R&D Systems. Dasatinib was from Eton Bioscience. Gefitinib
was from LC Laboratories
Real-Time qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with the
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed on a System 7300 instrument
(Applied Biosystems) with a one-step program: 95°C for 10 min, 95°C for 30 s, and 60°C
for 1 min for 40 cycles. HPRT-1 gene expression was measured as a normalizer. Results
were analyzed by the relative quantity method. Experiments were performed in triplicate
with internal duplicate determinations.
Immunoblot analysis

Author Manuscript

Cell extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer [20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH
7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid] containing complete protease
inhibitor mixture (Roche). Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid
assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of cell extract were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with primary antibodies.
siRNA Transfection

Author Manuscript

uPAR-specific siRNA (5′-GCCGUUACCUCGAAUGCAU-3′) and uPA-specific siRNA
(5′CAUGUUACUGACC-AGCAAC-3′) are previously described.15,67 Non-targeting
control (NTC) siRNA was from Dharmacon. siRNAs (25 nM) were introduced into cells by
incubation with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in SFM for 4 h. Cultures were allowed to
recover in serum-containing medium for 12 h. The extent of gene-silencing was determined
by qPCR and immunoblot analysis.
Cell Migration Assays
Cell migration was studied using 6.5-mm Transwell chambers with 8 µm pores (Costar,
Corning, NY). Cells (1.5×105) that were transfected with siRNA targeting uPAR or uPA or
with NTC siRNA were added to the top chamber and allowed to migrate at 37°C. When
specified, Dasatinib was added to both chambers. The bottom chamber contained 10% FBS.

After 18 h, the upper surface of each membrane was cleaned with a cotton swab. The
membranes were then stained with Diff-Quick (Dade-Behring, Deerfield, IL). The number
of cells on the bottom surface of each membrane was counted (cells/field). Four fields from
each membrane were examined. Each condition was studied at least in triplicate.
SH2 domain pulldown assays
A construct encoding a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein with the SH2 domain
of c-Src (GST-SH2) was kindly provided by Dr. J.T. Parsons (University of Virginia) and
expressed in Escherichia coli. Bacterial cells that express GST-SH2 were suspended in 20
mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, with 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease
inhibitor cocktail and lysed by sonication. GST-SH2 was purified by glutathione-Sepharose
affinity chromatography.

Author Manuscript

To assess SH2 docking sites in the EGFR, an equivalent number of different GBM cells was
extracted in RIPA buffer. The extracts were subjected to centrifugation at 14,000×g for 10
min at 4°C. The supernatants were incubated with G ST-SH2 coupled to glutathinoneSepharose for 3 h at 4°C. The Sepharose beads were was hed three times with RIPA buffer
and resuspended in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. EGFR that associated with GSTSH2 was determined by immunoblot analysis. In control experiments, EGFR failed to
associate with glutathinone-Sepharose that was not loaded with GST-SH2.
Quantum dot immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy

Author Manuscript

An EGFRvIII-expressing human GBM (GBM39) was propagated as a xenograft40 and
kindly provided by C. David James (Department of Neurological Surgery, University of
California San Francisco). Harvested tumor tissue was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded,
and cut into 4 µm sections for mounting on positively-charged slides. Antigen retrieval was
performed using protease 2 (Ventana). Sections were immunostained with primary
antibodies targeting phospho-Tyr-845 (1:150; Abcam) and human uPAR (1:75; Dako) for 1
h at 37°C using the Ventana Discovery Ultra Platform. Q-dot-linked fluorescent secondary
antibodies (1:150; Invitrogen) were added for 1 h. The slides were rinsed and cover-slipped
with Prolong Gold and DAPI (Invitrogen). Slides were visualized on a Zeiss Axio Imager2
using Cambridge Research Instruments Nuance Multispectral Imaging System software to
capture images and visualize individual fluorophore spectra free from auto-fluorescence
noise. In control experiments, phospho-epitope labeling was validated using protein
phosphatase treatment, which eliminated signal.

subjected to immunoblot analysis to detect total EGFR (T-EGFR) and actin as a loading
control. The mobility of wild-type EGFR is shown with an arrow and the mobility of
EGFRvIII is shown with an arrowhead. (b) EGFRvIII-expressing U373MG cells were
transfected with uPAR-specific (+) or NTC siRNA (−), allowed to recover, and then
cultured in SFM for 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis

EGFR (T-EGFR) and actin as a loading control. (d) EGFRvIII-expressing U87MG cells
were transfected with uPAR-specific (+) or NTC siRNA (−), allowed to recover, and then
cultured in SFM for 24 h. The cells were then treated with EGF (2 ng/mL) for 10 min as
specified (the two right-hand lanes). Immunoblot analysis was performed. (e) wt-EGFRover-expressing U87MG cells and EGFRvIII-expressing U87MG cells were transfected with
uPAR-specific (+) or NTC (−) siRNA, transferred to SFM, and treated with EGF (2 ng/mL)
or vehicle for 10 min. Immunoblot analysis was performed.

uPAR regulates availability of SH2-binding sites in EGFRvIII. (a) EGFRvIII-expressing and
wt-EGFR-over-expressing U87MG cells were transfected with uPAR-specific (+) or NTC
(−) siRNA, transferred to SFM, and treated with 10 ng/mL EGF or with vehicle for 10 min.
Cell extracts were isolated and incubated with GST-SH2 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose
for 3 h at 4°C. The Sepharose beads were wash ed and re-suspended in SDS-sample buffer
for SDS-PAGE. EGFR that affinity-precipitated with GST-SH2 was determined by
immunoblot analysis. Total cell extracts also were subjected to immunoblot analysis as a
control for load. (b) EGFRvIII-expressing U373MG cells were transfected with uPARspecific (+) or NTC (−) siRNA, transferred to SFM, and treated with 10 ng/mL EGF or with
vehicle for 10 min. Binding of EGFRvIII to GST-SH2 was determined as described in panel

uPAR and phospho-Tyr-845 vary concordantly in individual cells in human GBM tissue. (a)
An EGFRvIII-expressing human GBM was propagated as a xenograft. Harvested tissue was
subjected to quantum dot immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies that detect
human uPAR (red, left) and phospho-Tyr-845 (green, middle). The merged image (right),
highlights co-localization of uPAR and phospho-Tyr-845 (yellow). (b) To quantify antigen
signal intensity, multispectral imaging was performed followed by spectral intensity
analysis. The signal intensity for uPAR-staining was plotted against that for phospho-

Effects of EGFRvIII neutralization on SFK activation in U373MG GBM cells. (a) U373MG
cells that express EGFRvIII under the control of a Dox repressible promoter were treated
with Dox (1 µg/ml) (+) or with vehicle (−) for 4 days. The cells were transferred to SFM and
allowed to condition medium for 2 days. The medium was concentrated 10× and subjected
to immunoblot analysis to detect uPA. Cell extracts were then prepared and immunoblotted
to detect EGFR and tubulin as a control for load. Equivalent incubations were conducted to
isolate RNA. uPA mRNA expression was compared in Dox-treated (+) and control (−Dox)

A model showing overlap in downstream targets for EGFRvIII and uPAR-initiated cellsignaling. uPAR signals as a component of a multiprotein receptor complex, which probably
includes integrins, the GPCR, FPRL1, and RTKs. Gefitinib targets EGFRvIII signaling and
may activate uPAR as a compensatory, pro-survival response. SFKs, which are targeted by
Dasatinib, serve as key upstream signaling factors in the uPAR cell-signaling system. PI3K
and ERK1/2 are well described pro-survival factors. PI3K, ERK1/2, and Rac1 have been
implicated in cancer cell migration.
