Abstract:
Glioma development is a multistep process, involving alterations in genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms and enzymes that promote
epigenetic changes in gliomas are urgently needed to identify novel therapeutic
targets. We examined the role of histone demethylase KDM1 in glioma progression.
KDM1 was overexpressed in gliomas and its expression positively correlated with
histological malignancy. Knockdown of KDM1 expression or its pharmacological
inhibition using pargyline or NCL-1 significantly reduced the proliferation of glioma
cells. Inhibition of KDM1 promoted up regulation of the p53 target genes p21
and PUMA. Patient-derived primary GBM cells expressed high levels of KDM1 and
pharmacological inhibition of KDM1 decreased their proliferation. Further, KDM1
inhibition reduced the expression of stemness markers CD133 and nestin in GBM cells.
Mouse xenograft assays revealed that inhibition of KDM1 significantly reduced glioma
xenograft tumor growth. Inhibition of KDM1 increased levels of H3K4-me2 and H3K9Ac histone modifications, reduced H3K9-me2 modification and promoted expression
of p53 target genes (p21 and PUMA), leading to apoptosis of glioma xenograft tumors.
Our results suggest that KDM1 is overexpressed in gliomas and could be a potential
therapeutic target for the treatment of gliomas.

Introduction

changes in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms [4;5].
Histone methylation is a dynamic process that has
been associated with either transcriptional activation
or repression [6] and emerging evidence suggests that
alterations in histone methylation play a vital role in
many neoplastic processes [7]. Unlike genetic alterations,
epigenetic changes are reversible and thus, targeting
epigenetic changes represents a promising therapeutic
approach.

Gliomas are the most malignant primary brain
tumors and account for more than 70% of all primary
brain tumors [1;2]. Current therapies result in a median
survival of 12–15 months [3]. Therefore, understanding
the mechanisms of glioma development and finding
new therapeutic options is clinically significant. Glioma
development is a multistep process that results from

KDM1 inhibition reduces the
proliferation and colony formation

The lysine-specific demethylase-1 (KDM1; also
known as LSD1, AOF2 or BHC110) gene encodes a flavindependent monoamine oxidase, which can demethylate
mono- and dimethylated lysines, specifically histone H3,
lysines 4, 9, 27 and 36 [8]. KDM1 is highly conserved
in eukaryotes and required for many physiological
functions [9]. Recent investigations found that KDM1
interacts with nuclear receptors and chromatin-modifying
corepressor complexes such as the Co-Rest complex
[10;11]. KDM1 also interacts with non-histone substrates
including p53 [12] and pRb [13]. KDM1 is overexpressed
in different cancer types, including neuroblastoma [14],
prostate, breast, and colon cancers [15]. Even though these
findings suggest a role of KDM1 in cancer progression,
the significance of KDM1 in glioma progression remain
elusive.
In this study, we examined the status of KDM1
in gliomas by using tumor tissue arrays and tested the
therapeutic significance of pharmacological inhibition of
the KDM1 axis in gliomas by using both in vitro and in
vivo preclinical xenograft models. Our results demonstrate
that deregulation of KDM1 expression occurs during
glioma progression with highest expression in high-grade
gliomas. Pharmacological inhibition of either KDM1
activity or knockdown of its expression via siRNA reduces
the proliferation of established as well as patient-derived
primary GBM cells. Mechanistic studies showed that
KDM1 inhibitors promote apoptosis of glioma cells via
activation of p53 pathway.

cell

To examine the significance of KDM1 in glioma
cells, we knocked down KDM1 expression by using the
siRNA approach. U87 and LN229 cells were transiently
transfected with KDM1-siRNA or control-siRNA. Western
blot analysis showed that KDM1 expression was ~80%
less in KDM1-siRNA than in control siRNA transfected
cells (Fig 2A). Cell proliferation assays revealed that
glioma cell proliferation in KDM1 knockdown cells
was significantly less than that of control siRNA (Fig
2B). To further probe the function of KDM1, we used
pharmacological inhibitors of KDM1 (pargyline and
NCL-1) that are known to inhibit the KDM1 enzyme
activity [20]. As shown in Fig. 2C, treatment of glioma
cells with either pargyline or NCL-1 significantly reduced
their proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Further,
clonogenic assays revealed that pargyline and NCL1 significantly reduced the colony formation ability
of glioma cells (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that
inhibition of KDM1 has potential to impair the glioma
cell proliferation.

KDM1 inhibition modulates acetylation of p53 and
activates its target gene expression p21 and PUMA
Recent studies suggest that in addition to modulation
of histone substrates, KDM1 associates with p53 and
regulates its function by demethylation [12] and that
the interplay between p53 methylation and acetylation
provide mechanisms for triggering a rapid increase in
p53 transcriptional activity. Because inhibition of KDM1
decreased glioma proliferation, we examined whether
pharmacological inhibition of KDM1 enhanced acetylation
of p53382, a known modification that activates the p53
stability and functions. Pargyline and NCL-1 treatments
substantially increased the levels of acetyl-p53382 in both
U87 and LN229 glioma cells (Fig. 3A). The total p53
levels were not altered after KDM1 inhibition. We next
validated the activation of p53 by KDM1 inhibition using
p53 reporter gene assays. As shown in Fig 3B, both the
pargyline and NCL-1 treatments significantly increased
the p53 reporter activity in both U87 and LN229 glioma
cell lines. p53 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by
activating the transcription of its target genes p21 and
PUMA, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis showed that
knockdown of KDM1 significantly increased the mRNA
levels of p21 and PUMA in both U87 and LN229 cells
(Fig 3C). Similarly, treatment with either pargyline or
NCL-1 also significantly increased the p21 and PUMA
expression in both U87 and LN229 cell lines (Fig. 3D,E).
Accordingly, Western blot analysis showed that treatment
with either pargyline or NCL-1 significantly enhanced the
p21 levels in both U87 and LN229 cells (Fig. 3F).

Results
KDM1 is overexpressed in gliomas and its
expression correlates with histological malignancy
Recent evidence attributed an oncogenic role for
KDM1 in various malignancies [19]. To determine the
status of KDM1 in gliomas, we checked the expression of
KDM1 using glioma tissue arrays that contain the different
grades of gliomas as well as normal brain tissues and the
intensity of staining was scored as described previously
[18]. The representative staining for each grade is shown
in Fig. 1A. KDM1 expression was significantly higher
in gliomas than in normal brain tissues and positively
correlated with histological malignancy (Fig. 1B). Western
blot analysis of total lysates from glioma cell lines
revealed that higher KDM1 expression in the majority of
the tested glioma cell lines (Fig. 1C). These results suggest
that KDM1 is highly expressed in gliomas.

epigenetic modifications, we determined the status of
global H3K4 and H3K9 methylation and H3K9 acetylation
marks in xenograft tumors. Immunohistochemical
analysis showed that global H3K4 methylation and
H3K9 acetylation were significantly greater in pargylinetreated tumors than in control tumors (Fig. 6A). We also
observed that H3K9 methylation was significantly reduced
in pargyline-treated tumors than in control tumors (Fig.
6A). To examine whether the effects reflect the expression
of p53 target genes involved in the repression of growth,
we analyzed mRNA expression of p21 and PUMA by
using total RNA isolated from xenograft tumors. The
expression levels of p21 and PUMA were significantly
higher in pargyline-treated xenograft tumors than in
control tumors (Fig. 6B). To test whether pargyline
treatment promoted the alteration in epigenetic marks at
the p53 response element on p21 promoter, we examined
the status of the H3K4-me2 and H3K9-me2 marks after
treating U87 cells with pargyline. A substantial increase
was found in the H3K4-me2 and reduction on H3K9-me2
at the p21 promoters (Fig. 6C). These studies suggest that
blockage of the KDM1 axis via pargyline has potential to
decrease glioma proliferation in vivo and that pargyline
promotes tumor suppressive effects probably by epigenetic
modification at promoters of p53 target genes.

Recent studies indicated that KDM1 regulates neural
stem cell proliferation [21], and that metastatic behaviour
and resistance to conventional radiation and chemotherapy
of glioblastomas is attributed to the presence of stem-like
glioma cells (SLGCs) [22;23]. To test whether inhibition
of activity of KDM1 reduces SLGCs proliferation, we
treated the SLGCs derived from primary GBM samples
with pargyline or NCL-1. All the SLGCs tested have
elevated levels of KDM1 (Fig. 4A). Pargyline and NCL1 dose-dependently reduced the proliferation of SLGCs
(Fig. 4B). We then studied the expression of neural stem
markers such as Nestin and CD133 after treatment with
either pargyline or NCL-1. The expression levels of Nestin
and CD133 were significantly downregualted in SLGCs
after the pargyline and NCL-1 treatments (Fig. 4C).
These results further confirm that KDM1 is required for
maintaining stemness of SLGCs.

Pargyline treatment inhibits the glioma xenograft
tumor growth and induces apoptosis
To study the therapeutic effect of KDM1 inhibition
on the growth of gliomas in vivo, we used a nude micebased subcutaneous glioma xenograft model. NOD/SCID
mice were subcutaneously implanted with 1 X 106 U87
glioma cells in their flank regions. When the tumors
reached measurable size, the mice were given either
pargyline or PBS intraperitonially. Tumor volumes were
measured every 5 days and mice were euthanized 30 days
after treatment. Compared to PBS, pargyline treatment
significantly reduced the tumor growth (Fig.5A). No
toxicities were observed in pargyline treatment group as
determined by behavioural changes, such as eating habits
and mobility, and mouse weights were not significantly
different between the control and pargyline-treated
groups (Fig. 5B). The expression of Ki-67 (proliferation
marker) was significantly lower in the pargyline-treated
tumors than in the control tumors (Fig. 5C). TUNEL
analysis showed that the number of apoptotic cells was
significantly higher in the pargyline-treated tumors than
in the control tumors (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that
pargyline-mediated reduction in xenograft tumor growth
involves both a reduction of proliferation and an induction
of apoptosis.

Discussion
Glioma development is a multistep process that
involves various genetic and epigenetic alterations
[24]. Unlike genetic alterations, epigenetic changes are
reversible and thus, targeting epigenetic changes represents
a promising therapeutic approach. KDM1 regulates gene
expression programs by changing the epigenetic histone
marks in gene promoters [10]. In this study, we tested the
hypothesis that deregulation of KDM1 promotes glioma
progression and tested the therapeutic effect of targeting
KDM1 axis using in vitro and in vivo methods. The results
using tumor tissue microarray studies revealed that KDM1
is overexpressed in glioma tissues and its expression
positively correlates with histological malignancy.
Further, our results demonstrated that pharmacological
inhibition of KDM1 activity or knockdown of KDM1
expression decreases the proliferation of glioma cell lines
by modulating the p53 pathway.
The transcriptional factor p53 functions as a guardian
of the genome by modulating appropriate responses to
stress. The function of p53 is tightly regulated by various
post-translational modifications including acetylation,
and methylation. KDM1 demethylates p53K370me2,
which prevents its interaction with the coactivator 53BP1,
thereby blocking the p53 transcriptional activation and
induction of p53-mediated apoptosis [12]. The acetylation
of lysines at the C-terminus of p53 protects p53 from
ubiquitination, and acetylation at lys382 increases
the DNA binding activity of p53 [25] and promotes its

interaction with other transcriptional factors [26]. In the
present study, we observed that the KDM1 inhibitors
pargyline and NCL-1 increase the levels of acetyl-p53382
and increase p53 reporter gene activation. Further, KDM1
inhibition increased induction of the p53 target genes p21
and PUMA. These findings suggest that the blockage of
KDM1 functions via pharmacological inhibition may
provide a favourable environment for the activation of
p53 and its target genes, leading to suppression of gliomas.
KDM1 plays a key role in many physiological
functions, and recent studies suggested that KDM1 is
often overexpressed in various cancers [27]. KDM1
knockdown reduces proliferation by affecting expression
of several genes involved in proliferation including p21,
CCNA2, and ERBB2, which arrests the cell cycle at G1/S
phase [15]. G0/G1 phase [28] and G2/M phase [29].
In this study, we observed that inhibition of activity or
knockdown of KDM1 expression reduced proliferation
and colony formation of glioma cell lines in vitro and
reduce tumor growth in vivo. Recent TCGA studies
revealed TP53 mutations in ~35% gliomas, suggesting
an alternate mechanism of WTp53 inactivation occurs
in the remaining ~65% of gliomas. Since KDM1
expression is upregulated in gliomas, because KDM1mediated demethylation reduces p53 transactivation
functions, blocking the KDM1 axis could have therapeutic
implications for reducing glioma proliferation in WTp53
expressing gliomas.

Recent studies implicate KDM1 as a key player in
the maintenance of pluripotency and high levels of KDM1
are needed to maintain the undifferentiated state of human
embryonic stem cells [28]. Knockdown of KDM1 or
inhibition of its enzymatic activity results in the selective
inhibition of pluripotent stem cells proliferation but a
lesser effect has been seen on non-pluripotent cancer or
normal somatic cells [30]. Recent studies also highlighted
the importance of KDM1 in the regulation of neural stem
cell proliferation and differentiation. In neural stem cells
KDM1 is recruited to the TLX target genes to repress their
expression, which regulates the proliferation of neural
stem cells and it has also been showed that knockdown
of KDM1 or treatment with the KDM1 inhibitors
pargyline and tranylcypromine reduced the proliferation
of hippocampus neural progenitor cells [21]. Inhibition
of KDM1 is also shown to reactivate the ATRA-induced
differentiation in acute myeloid leukaemia [31]. In this
study, we demonstrated that KDM1 is overexpressed in
SLGCs and treatment with KDM1 inhibitors reduces
the proliferation of SLGCs. Further KDM1 inhibitors
decreased the expression of stemness genes in SLGCs.
KDM1 is a target for monoamine oxidase inhibitors
including pargyline and tranylcypromine, which are
currently used as antidepressants and are shown to inhibit
KDM1 activity. In our study, we used pargyline (trade
name: Eutonyl, Supirdyl, Eutron), an FDA approved drug
to treat depression and vascular hypertension. Pargyline

better inhibitors of KDM1 that work efficiently at lower
doses with high specificity. We recently developed the
compound NCL-1 that showed significant inhibitory
activity on glioma cells in~20 µM range. Using the glioma
model cells, we demonstrated that NCL-1 treatment
promoted p53 functions as well as modulated optimal
epigenetic changes, leading to the activation p53 target
genes. Future studies are clearly needed to test its in vivo
potential, safety and utility in combinatorial therapy.
In summary, our study findings establish that
deregulation of KDM1 expression occurs during glioma
progression and provides the first in vivo evidence
demonstrating the KDM1 axis as a potential therapeutic
target for gliomas. Inhibition of KDM1 alone or in
combination with other epigenetic-modifying agents

had significant growth inhibitory properties in vitro.
A recent study using in vitro assays found synergistic
apoptosis occurred when the combination of KDM1
and HDAC inhibitors was used [32], also supporting
our findings. In our study, we further extended these
findings and tested the therapeutic potential of the
KDM1 inhibitor pargyline in vivo by using a xenograft
model. Pargyline treatment reduced glioma growth,
increased levels of H3K4-me2 and H3K9-Ac and reduced
levels of H3K9-me2, and these changes correlated with
increased apoptosis. This proof of principle in vivo study
demonstrated the significance of the KDM1 axis in
curbing glioma progression. However, the extended period
use of a high concentration of pargyline may cause side
effects. To overcome this, we are currently developing

Cell lysis and Western blotting

Reporter gene assays

Whole cell lysates were prepared from glioma
cells in modified RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM
Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% [wt/vol]
sodium deoxycholate and 1% Triton X-100) containing
phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Lysates were run on
SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using indicated
antibodies and developed using the ECL methodology.

Cell proliferation and clonogenic assays

Actin

Cell proliferation rates were measured by using
MTT Cell Viability Assay in 96-well microplates. Glioma
cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 x 103 cells/well) in
DMEM medium containing 10% serum. After an overnight
incubation, cells were treated with varying concentrations
of pargyline or NCL-1 for 72 h and growth inhibition
was determined by using traditional MTT assays. For the
primary GBM cells, single-cell suspensions were plated in
96-well plates (1 x 103 cells/well), and pargyline- or NCL1-mediated growth inhibition was determined by using
traditional MTS assays. For the clonogenic assays, U87
and LN229 cells (500 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well
plates. After an overnight incubation, cells were treated
with pargyline (3 mM) or NCL-1 (10 µM) for 72 h. Then
cells were washed with PBS and allowed to grow for an
additional 7 days. The cells were then fixed in ice cold
methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution
to visualize the colonies. Colonies that contain ≥ 50 cells
were counted.

cells were transfected with p53-Luc plasmid using fugene
for 6 h. Then, 24 h after transfection, cells were treated
with vehicle, pargyline or NCL-1 for an additional 24
h. Each transfection was carried out in triplicate and
normalized with the β-gal activity and total protein
concentration. Luciferase activity was measured by using
the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI).
Luciferase activity was expressed as percent of relative

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using
Allred scoring methodology as described in our earlier
publication [18]. Allred score takes into consideration
the proportion of positive cells (scored on a scale of
0-5) and staining intensity (scored on a scale of 0-3).
The proportion of positive stained cells was rated as
1 = between 0% and 1% positive, 2 = between 1% and 10%,
3 = between 10% and 33%, 4 = between 33% and 66%, and
5 = between 66% and 100%. The preparation of negative
controls was accomplished by replacing the primary
antibody with control rabbit IgG. The sections were scored

Xenograft tumor sections were incubated overnight with
Ki-67, H3K4-Me2, H3K9-me2 and H3K9-Ac primary
antibodies and positivity was visualized by using the
DAB substrate and counterstained with haematoxylin
(Vector Lab, Inc. Burlingame, CA). The proliferative
index was calculated as the percentage of Ki-67-positive
cells in 10 randomly selected microscopic fields at 100X
per slide. TUNEL analysis was done by using the In situ
Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as per
the manufacturer’s protocol and 10 randomly selected
microscopic fields in each group were used to calculate
the relative ratio of TUNEL-positive cells.

U87 cells were seeded in 100 mm plates and after
overnight incubation cells were treated with vehicle
or pargyline. Then, cells were cross-linked using 1%
formaldehyde, and the chromatin was subjected to
immunoprecipitation using H3K4-me2 and H3K9-me2
antibodies. Isotype-specific IgG was used as a control.

were housed in accordance with UTHSCSA institution’s
protocol for animal experiments. For xenograft tumor
assays, 1 x 106 U87 cells were mixed with an equal
volume of matrigel and implanted subcutaneously into the
flanks of 6-week-old female NOD/SCID mice as described
[18]. Once the tumors reached measurable size, mice were
divided into control and treatment groups. The control
group received PBS, and the treatment group received
pargyline (100 mg/kg in PBS) i.p. per day for a period
of 30 days. Tumor volumes were measured with a caliper
at 5-day intervals. After the 30th day, the mice were
euthanized, and the tumors were isolated and processed
for histological studies. Tumor volume was calculated by
using a modified ellipsoidal formula: tumor volume = ½
(L x W2), where L is the longitudinal diameter and W is
the transverse diameter [18]. Body weight was measured
at weekly intervals for monitoring of the drug toxicity.
