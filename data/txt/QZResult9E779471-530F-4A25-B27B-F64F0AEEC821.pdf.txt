ABSTRACT
Associations between growth factor receptor-mediated cell signaling and
cancer cell growth have been previously characterized. Receptors for prostaglandin
E2, such as EP2, and EP4, play roles in cancer growth, progression and invasion.
Thus, we examined the interactions between EP2/EP4- and IGF-1R-mediated
cellular signaling in human pancreatic cancer cells. Selective antagonists against
EP2 and EP4 abrogated IGF-1-stimulated cell growth and suppressed MEK/ERK
phosphorylation. In subsequent experiments, phospho-antibody arrays indicated
increased phosphorylation levels of protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) at the Thr538 position
following the inhibition of EP2/EP4-mediated signaling. Inhibition of PKC-θ activity
impaired cell viability compared with EP2/EP4-antagonized IGF-1-stimulated cells.
PKC-θ kinase MAP4K3, which plays a pivotal role in PKC-θ activation, also affected
growth signaling in the presence of EP2/EP4 antagonists. Administration of EP2 and
EP4 antagonists significantly inhibited the growth of an orthotopic xenograft of IGF1-secreting pancreatic cancer cells, with increased phospho-PKC-θ and decreased
phospho-ERK. Clinico-pathological analyses showed that 17.4% of surgical pancreatic
cancer specimens were quadruple-positive for IGF-1R, EP2 (or EP4), MAP4K3, and
PKC-θ. These results indicate a novel signaling crosstalk between EP2/EP4 and IGF1R in cancer cells, and suggest that the MAP4K3-PKC-θ axis is central and could be
exploited as a molecular target for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

antisense, and inhibitory analogues of IGF-1 suppress
tumor cell growth and angiogenesis [10-13]. In patients
with several cancers including pancreatic cancer, high
expression of IGF-1R in tumors is associated with higher
tumor grades and poor survival [14, 15]. In vitro studies
have shown that exogenous IGF-1-stimulated growth
of pancreatic cancer cell lines is abrogated following
treatment with anti-IGF1R antibodies [16].
Prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
are also associated with cancer cell growth, tumor
development and metastasis, as well as with inflammation
and other physiological events [17,18]. Cycooxygenase-2
(COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that converts arachidonic
acid into prostaglandins, and its roles in the development

Growth factor receptor-mediated signaling is
known to be important for cancer cell growth, tumor
development, metastasis and various other events in
several types of cancer, including pancreatic carcinomas
[1-5]. Therefore, most therapeutic molecular targets
involve the kinase activities of growth factor receptors
and their ligands [6]. Insulin-like growth factor-1 and
-2 (IGF-1 and -2, respectively) and their receptors (IGF1R) are potential targets that trigger multiple intracellular
signaling pathways [5, 7]. The circulating IGF-1 levels are
closely associated with the risk of cancer [8, 9], and the
blockade of IGF-1R, using anti-IGF-R1 antibodies, IGF1R

of many tumor types have been demonstrated in genetic
and inhibitor studies, histopathological analyses, and
epidemiological studies [19-23]. PGE2 receptors or
E-prostanoid receptors (EPs) comprise several subtypes
(EP1-EP4), which can be classified into three types based
on their signaling features [24]. Both basic and clinical
studies have reported increased PGE2 production and
the overexpression of EPs in tumor tissues in pancreatic
cancer, as well as in a wide range of cancers [25, 26].
Therefore, EP-mediated cellular signaling may be a potent
antitumor target, which could be exploited using specific
antagonists of EPs or COX.
Numerous interactions between growth factor
receptor-mediated signaling pathways have been shown
to play pivotal roles in accelerated cancer cell growth,
invasion, and metastasis. In particular, the interactions
between IGF-1R, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and
estrogen receptors have been reported to synergistically
potentiate cell proliferation [27-29]. Moreover, the
transactivation of EP and EGFR, and the subsequent
activation of mitogenic signaling have also been
demonstrated in several cancers [30-32]. However,
reciprocal combinations between EPs and other growth
factor receptors, including IGF-1R, have not been fully
elucidated. In the present study, we checked for the
presence of alternative signaling interactions between
EPs and IGF-1R mainly in pancreatic cancer cells using
selective antagonists against EP2 and EP4. Thereafter,
phospho-antibody arrays were used to determine the
molecular relationships between EPs and IGF-1R
signaling, where in vivo experiments and clinicopathological analyses were performed to demonstrate the
molecular basis and probability of this signaling crosstalk.

expression were observed in Capan-1 cells (Fig 1A). In
subsequent experiments, similar levels of IGF-1R mRNA
and protein, IGF-2R, and NRDc mRNA were expressed in
all cell lines. However, IR mRNA expression was detected
only in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, whereas EGFR and
ErbB4 mRNAs were not expressed in any of the four cell
lines (Fig 1A).

Antagonism of EP2/EP4 signaling blocks IGF-1induced growth stimulation in BxPC-3 cells
To investigate the effects of the antagonism of EP2/
EP4-mediated cellular signaling on growth factor receptormediated growth stimulation, we treated cells with
EP2/EP4 antagonists, i.e., AH6809/GW627368X, and
assessed HB-EGF-, IGF-1-, and IGF-2-mediated growth
stimulation. Single treatments with AH6809/GW627368
did not significantly affect cell viability in any of the cell
lines (Fig 1C). Growth factor treatments increased the cell
viability in all lines, but the degree of stimulation was
relatively low in Capan-1. In BxPC-3 cells, pretreatment
with AH6809/GW627368X completely blocked the
growth stimulated by HB-EGF and IGF-1 and partially
inhibited stimulation following treatment with IGF-2. In
PANC-1 cells, pretreatment with AH6809/GW627368X
only blocked HB-EGF-mediated growth stimulation,
whereas growth stimulation by these growth factors was
not affected by pretreatment with AH6809/GW627368X
in MiaPaCa-2 and Capan-1 cells (Fig 2A). We also
tested single treatments of AH6809 or GW627368X
and assessed IGF-1-mediated growth stimulation in
BxPC-3 cells. Pretreatment with GW627368X almost
completely blocked growth stimulation by IGF-1 and
pretreatment with AH6809 also suppressed it to a low
but significant extent (Supplementary Fig 2A). Based on
these results, we decided that it was appropriate to use
AH6809/GW627368X in combination to achieve absolute
inhibition of EP2/EP4-mediated cellular signaling. The
same experiment was conducted using human breast
cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and human
prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP.
Similar inhibitory effects were also found in MCF-7 and
DU145 cells, as well as in BxPC-3 cells (Supplementary
Fig 2B).
In BxPC-3 cells, treatment with growth factors
induced the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, whereas
pretreatment with AH6809/GW627368X attenuated their
phosphorylation in IGF-1-treated cells (Fig 2B). Single
treatments with AH6809/GW627368 did not affect the
phosphorylation of MEK and ERK (Supplementary Fig
1). No changes were observed in HB-EGF-treated cells
and phosphorylation decreased only marginally in IGF2-treated cells (Fig 2B). EP4 knockdown also abrogated
IGF-1-induced cell growth and the phosphorylation of
MEK and ERK with similar efficacy to that following

RESULTS
Characteristics of human pancreatic cancer cells
Initially, the expression of 12 parameters was
examined in the pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa-2,
BxPC-3, PANC-1, and Capan-1 by RT-PCR, and the
secretions of PGE2 in culture media (CM) were determined
using EIA. COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression was
observed in BxPC-3 cells.
Capan-1 cells expressed COX-2 mRNA, whereas
MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells did not. Therefore, EIA
analyses revealed the highest PGE2 levels in BxPC-3 CM
(over 10 times than that in the other cell lines, Fig 1B).
MiaPaCa-2 cells expressed EP4 mRNA at very low levels,
whereas BxPC-3 cells exhibited low expression of EP2
mRNA and high expression of EP4 mRNA. Only high EP4
mRNA expression was observed in PANC-1 cells, whereas
moderate EP2 mRNA expression and weak EP4 mRNA

signaling in IGF-1-treated BxPC-3 cells. Compared
with IGF-1-treated cells, three induced proteins and
five inhibited proteins were identified in AH6809/
GW627368X-pretreated IGF-1-treated cells with cut-off
and fold changes of >2.0 and <0.5, respectively (Table
1). The protein that changed the most was PKC-θ, which
exhibited an 8.628-fold increase in the phosphorylation of
Thr538. Consistent with this observation, immunoblotting
detected increased phospho-PKC-θ at Thr538 in AH6809/
GW627368X-pretreated IGF-1-treated cells compared
with IGF-1-treated cells and untreated cells (Fig 3A).

Moreover, treatments with AH6809/GW627368X
alone induced the phosphorylation of PKC-θ in a timedependent manner (Fig 3B). EP4 knockdown increased
the phosphorylation of PKC-θ with similar efficacy
to that following AH6809/GW627368X pretreatment
(Supplementary Fig 2A). Because the phosphorylation
of PKC-θ at Thr538 is associated directly with kinase
activity [33], we examined the effect of PKC-θ inhibition
using a pseudo-substrate as a specific inhibitor on growth
stimulation following the antagonism of EP2/EP4
signaling. Inhibition of the basal activity of PKC-θ by
a pseudo-substrate suppressed IGF-1-mediated growth
stimulation (data not shown). Together with the AH6809/
GW627368X pretreatments in the presence of the pseudosubstrate, the number of IGF-1-treated viable cells
further decreased by approximately 43% and the MEK
and ERK phosphorylation levels also reduced (Fig 3C).
However, according to both growth stimulation assays and
immunoblotting, the knockdown of PKC-θ using a specific
siRNA impaired the effect of AH6809/GW627368X
pretreatment (Fig 4A). Finally, RT-PCR demonstrated
the compensatory expression of PKC-α mRNA in PKC-α
siRNA-transfected cells (Fig 4B).

antibodies against phospho-MAP4K3 are currently
unavailable, the MAP4K3 and PDK1 protein levels were
knocked down using specific siRNAs (Fig 5B). MAP4K3
knockdown abrogated the suppressive effect of AH6809/
GW627368X on IGF-1-stimulated cell growth compared
with negative control siRNA- and PDK1 siRNAtransfected cells (Fig 5C). To support this observation,
immunoblotting showed that MAP4K3 knockdown
cells failed to phosphorylate PKC-θ or to suppress the
phosphorylation of MEK and ERK following AH6809/
GW627368X pretreatment and IGF-1 treatment (Fig 5D).
Similar to that in AH6809/GW627368X-pretreated cells,
the MAP4K3 knockdown abolished the suppression of
IGF-1-stimulated cell growth, PKC-θ phosphorylation,
and the inhibition of MEK and ERK phosphorylation in
cells transfected with EP4 siRNA (Supplementary Fig
3B). In the cells transfected with negative control siRNA
or PDK1 siRNA, pretreatment with AH6809/GW627368X
increased the phosphorylation of PKC-θ and suppressed
the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK (Fig 5D). In
subsequent experiments, the specific PDK1 inhibitor
BX912 had no effects on the AH6809/GW627368Xinduced suppression of IGF-1-stimulated cell growth
and PKC-θ, or MEK, and ERK phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig 4).

Further analyses of phospho-PDK1 and phosphoAMPKα were performed because the phosphorylation
of PKC-θ is reportedly achieved by PDK1, AMPK, and
MAP4K3 [34]. The phospho-PDK1 levels were not
altered in IGF-1-treated cells or in AH6809/GW627368Xpretreated IGF-1-treated cells (Fig 5A). However, AMPKα
phosphorylation was not induced by any of the treatments
described above and the total protein levels of PDK1,
AMPKα, and MAP4K3 were similar in the non-treated
cells, IGF-1-treated cells, and AH6809/GW627368Xpretreated IGF-1-treated cells. Because commercial

the vector-control transfected cells (BxPC-mock), and
treatments with AH6809/GW627368X decreased cell
proliferation only in BxPC-hmIGF1 (Supplementary Fig
5A-C). Intrapancreatic injection of these cells caused
tumor formation in both groups, with larger tumors
in BxPC-hmIGF1-injected mice. The average tumor
weights and serum IGF-1 levels in BxPC-hmIGF1injected mice were significantly higher than those in
BxPC-mock-injected mice (Supplementary Fig 5D).
H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining
for IGF-1 showed that these tumors were somewhat
differentiated, and that IGF-1 expression was sustained
during the experimental period. In addition, the number
of Ki-67-positive cells (a marker for proliferative cells)
significantly increased with the tumor weights in BxPChmIGF1-injected mice (Supplementary Fig 5E). Thus,
the effects of AH6809/GW627368X on pancreatic tumor

growth were examined in BxPC-hmIGF1-bearing mice.
The mean body weights of AH6809/GW627368Xtreated mice did not significantly change compared
with control mice during the experimental period (Fig
6A). The incidence of the visible tumors did not change
(80% in control mice and 70% in AH6809/GW627368Xtreated mice); however, the tumor weights significantly
decreased in AH6809/GW627368X-treated mice (Fig
6A). H&E and immunohistochemical staining for IGF1 showed that treatment with AH6809/GW627368X did
not alter the tumor types or IGF-1 expression (Fig 6B).
Moreover, immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 and
the quantification of labeling indices indicated that the
percentages of Ki-67-positive cells were significantly
lower in AH6809/GW627368X-treated mice (Fig 6B).
Next, the phosphorylation levels of PKC-θ, MEK, and
ERK were examined by immunoblotting in tumor lesions.

DISCUSSION

various types of cancer cells including breast and prostate
cancer, if both the feedback loop of COX-EP (2 and/or
4)-PGE2 production and IGF-1R expression exhibited.
The partial suppression of IGF-2-stimulated cell growth
may reflect as differences in the binding affinity of
IGF-1R, which may offset the effects of IGF-2 by IGF2R. In agreement with the growth stimulation assays,
corresponding phosphorylation levels of MEK and ERK
were confirmed. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Akt,
which is a key molecule in the other main IGF-1-mediated
signaling pathways, was not significantly altered under
these conditions (data not shown). Overall, these data
indicate the primary contribution of EP2/EP4 signaling to
IGF-1R-mediated growth and MAPK signaling.
Kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation
are central components of cell signal transduction.
The AH6809/GW627368X pretreatments blocked
the phosphorylation and activation of MEK and
ERK, so we performed phospho-antibody arrays that
demonstrated the dramatic phosphorylation of PKC-θ
Thr538, which presumably leads to increased kinase
activity. PKC-θ plays essential roles in the regulation of
peripheral T cell activation, prevention of T cell anergy,
T cell differentiation, and autoimmune pathogenesis
[37]. PKC-θ overexpression has been demonstrated in
gastrointestinal stromal tumors [38]; however, its main
roles, including those in pancreatic cancer, have not been
examined. Treatments with AH6809/GW627368X alone
induced PKC-θ phosphorylation, indicating that EP2/EP4
signaling may negatively regulate PKC-θ phosphorylation.
Moreover, the direct inhibition of PKC-θ using a
pseudosubstrate caused further decrease in cell viability,

Crosstalk between signaling pathways contributes
to tumor progression, metastasis, and the acquisition
of resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Thus, an improved
understanding of these interactions may facilitate the
identification of novel targets and the development of
effective anti-cancer strategies. Although many patterns
of signaling crosstalk have been demonstrated, only few
signaling pathways have been associated with EPs. In
the present study, we characterized a novel interaction
between EP2/EP4 and IGF-1R signaling pathways mainly
in pancreatic cancer cells.
Initially, we examined the mRNA expression
patterns of COX, EP receptors, and several growth factor
receptors in four pancreatic cancer cell lines. Among
these cell lines, BxPC-3 cells exhibited the most marked
COX- and EP4-dependent constitutive positive feedback
loop and they secreted PGE2 into CM; thus, they were
used in further experiments. Because IGF-1R, IGF-2R,
and NRDc were expressed in BxPC-3 cells, we performed
growth stimulation assays following treatment with IGF1, IGF-2, and HB-EGF. Pretreatment with the EP2/EP4
antagonists AH6809/GW627368X completely blocked
growth stimulation on treatment with IGF-1 and HB-EGF
and partially blocked it following treatment with IGF2. Similar reactions were observed in IGF-1-stimulated
MCF-7 and DU145 cells, which expressed EP2, EP4, and
IGF-1R, respectively (Supplementary Fig 2B and Ref.
35, 36). This result suggests that the similar interaction
may occur not only in pancreatic cancer cells but also in

as well as suppression of the phosphorylation of MEK
and ERK. Thus, phosphorylated PKC-θ may be associated
with cell survival, maintenance of cell viability, and cell
proliferation. Inhibition of the basal activity of PKC-θ
also suppressed IGF-1-mediated growth stimulation (data
not shown). Some studies suggest that IGF-1/IGF-1R
signaling directly upregulates the anti-apoptotic protein
bcl-2 and stabilizes the integrin α5β1, which is associated
with the MAPK pathway and cell growth, where its
activation and/or function was influenced by PKC activity
[39-42]. Based on these reports, we suggest that other
cellular events may occur independently of EP2/EP4
signaling-mediated crosstalk in IGF-1-treated cells. Under
these conditions, the impact of PKC-θ activity on cell
survival (anti-apoptotic) and growth may increase. Thus,
a treatment with AH6809/GW627368X activates PKC-θ,
and the effect of the PKC-θ pseudosubstrate may further
decrease the cell viability. PKC-θ knockdown impaired
the effects of AH6809/GW627368X pretreatment and
induced the expression of PKC-α mRNA, suggesting
that the compensatory induction of PKC-α, following the
knockdown of PKC-θ, protected against the effects of
AH6809/GW627368X. This result suggests that an RNA
interference-based therapy may be limited to molecular
targets with compensatory isoforms, and thus specific
inhibitors or pseudosubstrates with appropriate toxicity,
in vivo stability, and pharmaceutical availability may be
required. The phospho-antibody arrays also indicated that
the phosphorylation of IRS-1, which is closely related to
the activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt
signaling pathway, was induced by AH6809/GW627368X
pretreatment in IGF-1 treated cells. The PI3K/Akt pathway
is a key molecule in another major IGF-1-mediated
signaling pathway; however, we found no changes in of
Akt phosphorylation, as described above. Bouzakri et al.
reported that the phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser636/639 is
associated with the reduced phosphorylation of IRS-1 on
tyrosine and subsequent reduction in PI3K/Akt activation
[43]. This may explain why Akt phosphorylation remained
unchanged under our experimental conditions.
PKC-θ was reported to be phosphorylated
by the kinases PDK1, AMPK, and MAP4K3 [33].
Immunoblotting showed that there were no increases
in PDK1 and AMPK phosphorylation or changes in
MAP4K3 level with AH6809/GW627368X pretreatment.
However, MAP4K3 knockdown prevented the suppression
of growth stimulation, phosphorylation of PKC-θ, and
downregulation of phospho-MEK and -ERK by AH6809/
GW627368X pretreatment, whereas the negative control
siRNA and PDK-1 knockdown did not. These data indicate
that MAP4K3 is activated and that it phosphorylates
PKC-θ in AH6809/GW627368X-pretreated IGF-1 treated
cells. MAP4K3 (also known as GLK) activates JNK family
proteins in response to cellular stress and is expressed
in several tissues including pancreas [44]. MAP4K3
activity is also regulated by amino acid sufficiency and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the relevant phosphorylation sites have been identified
[45]. However, further investigations using currently
unavailable anti-phospho-MAP4K3 antibodies or specific
inhibitors of MAP4K3 are required to determine whether
AH6809/GW627368X pretreatment directly activates
MAP4K3. AH6809/GW627368X pretreatment may also
produce cellular stress, including alterations in the amino
acid content, so further studies of the relationship between
EP2/EP4 signaling and cellular stress-induced signal
transduction are required to fully characterize the role of
MAP4K3 in the present conditions.
To confirm the interactions between EP2/EP4 and
IGF-1R signaling in vivo, we established an orthotopic
xenograft model where IGF-1R signaling stimulated
tumor growth. Initially, we established a stable transfectant
cell line expressing hmIGF-1, which grew more rapidly
than the vector-control cells and responded to AH6809/
GW627368X treatment. The apparent induction of tumor
growth was observed after the injection of this transfectant
into the pancreas of nude mice. Using this transfectant, we
examined the effects of AH6809/GW627368X treatment,
which suppressed tumor growth and decreased the number
of Ki-67-positive cells. Moreover, immunohistochemical
analyses revealed that IGF-1 expression was preserved
during the experimental period, thereby indicating their
similarity to the in vitro conditions that we utilized.
Immunoblotting of tumor lesions also detected significant
alterations in the phosphorylation status of PKC-θ and
ERK, as shown in vitro. PGE2 also exerts various effects
on the immune system. With respect to tumor immunity,
PGE2 acts as an enhancer of tumor-suppressive regulatory
T cells and macrophages (M2 macrophages). PGE2 also
suppresses the function of NK cells and cytotoxic T
lymphocytes, as well as contributes to the breakdown of
the Th1/Th2 balance [46]. Thus, the mice in this model
were athymic and treatment with AH6809/GW627368X
could enhance the T cell-associated host tumor-immunity
as well as obtaining additive and/or synergistic effects
in general conditions, in addition to the effect of the
EP antagonists itself. There was a strong agreement
between the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments,
so we performed clinico-pathological analyses of surgical
specimens from pancreatic cancer patients. According to
these analyses, 17.4% of the cases were quadruple-positive
for IGF-1R, EP2/EP4, MAP4K3, and PKC-θ, indicating
that crosstalk may occur between these signaling
pathways in human pancreatic cancers. Report from
Koshiba et al., which demonstrated that COX-2-positive
rate in pancreatic cancer is very high [47], also assists
the probability of this crosstalk. Although the quadruplepositive rate of 17.4% is not very high, this result suggests
that our in vitro and in vivo findings may be reflected
in the clinical stages. In addition, these molecules were
detected by immunohistochemistry using formaldehydefixed paraffin blocks. Because the states of the paraffin
blocks and the surgical specimens were highly variable,
4839

it is possible that this may have caused the positive rate
for each parameter to appear relatively low. Therefore,
the positive rate may increase if another detection method
is applied (e.g., immunoblotting or RT-PCR using fresh
samples). These results also suggest that the specific
inhibition by PKC-θ may effectively suppress cancer cell
viability via changes in EP2/EP4 signaling in cases that
are quadruple-positive for IGF-1R, EP2 or EP4, MAP4K3,
and PKC-θ. Thus, specific small-molecule inhibitors of
PKC-θ could be developed for combination therapy with
EP2/EP4 antagonists to exploit this novel molecular target
for cancers that co-express IGF-1R, EP2 or EP4, and
PKC-θ. Combinations of anti-IGF-1R antibodies or small
molecule inhibitors of IGF-1R with gemcitabine, which
are used widely to treat pancreatic cancer, have additive
or synergistic effects on growth and survival [48, 49].
However, the presence of the EP2/EP4-MAP4K3-PKC-θ
axis and the precise effects of gemcitabine on this remain
unresolved.
Other unresolved mechanisms include: (i) the
effects of EP2/EP4 signaling on HB-EGF-mediated
cellular signaling; (ii) the involvement of other phosphoproteins identified in our phospho-antibody arrays; (iii) the
relationships between EP2/EP4 antagonism and MAP4K3
activation; and (iv) the presence of these molecules in
other types of cancer. Although the activities of these
phospho-proteins have been reported in previous studies
[50-52], our data indicate that multiple uncharacterized
mechanisms require further study. Overall, our results
demonstrate the crosstalk between EP2/EP4 and IGF1R signaling mainly in pancreatic cancer cells that
produce and secrete PGE2. The production of PGE2 is
reportedly upregulated in numerous cancer types and the
circulating IGF-1 levels are relatively stable. Therefore,
these molecular interactions may occur in the presence
of anti-inflammatory drugs or EP2/EP4 antagonists. In
these cases, PKC-θ may be a potent therapeutic target for
decreasing the cell growth and viability in tumor lesions.

of Laboratory Animals of the University of Tokushima
School of Medicine and were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee. Recombinant human IGF1 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and
human HB-EGF and IGF-2 were purchased from R&D
systems (Minneapolis, MN). The EP2-selective antagonist
AH6809 and EP4-selective antagonist GW627368X were
purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The
pseudo-substrate of PKC-θ was purchased from Merck
Millipore (Billerica, MA).

Expression of mRNAs and assessment of PGE2
secretion using enzyme immunoassays
Total RNAs samples were isolated from MiaPaCa-2,
BxPC-3, PANC-1, and Capan-1 cells using RNeasy Mini
kits (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Aliquots (1 µg) were then
subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR as previously
described [53], and COX-1, COX-2, EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4,
IR, IGF-1R, IGF-2R, EGFR, ErbB4, and NRDc were
determined using β-actin mRNA as an internal control
with the primer sequences listed in Supplementary Table
1. The PGE2 concentrations were determined in CM using
a PGE2 Express EIA kit (Cayman Chemical).

Growth stimulation assay
Cells (5 × 103 cells/well or 3 × 105 cells/well)
were plated on 96-well microplates or six-well plates,
preincubated overnight at 37°C, and then starved for 24 h
in 100 µL or 1.5 mL of serum-free medium. Subsequently,
equal volumes of serum-free medium containing HB-EGF,
IGF-1, and IGF-2 (50, 20, and 50 ng/mL, respectively)
were added, and the cells were incubated for 48 h or
20 min at 37°C. Pretreatments with 5 µM AH6809/
GW627368X were performed for 3 h prior to the
growth factor treatments. After stimulation, the viable
cells were counted by the MTT method or subjected
to immunoblotting. The immunoblotting procedure is
described below.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells, animals, and reagents

Immunoblotting

Human pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa-2,
BxPC-3, PANC-1, and Capan-1 were purchased from
the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury,
UK). Cells were maintained in DMEM (MiaPaCa-2)
and RPMI1640 (BxPC-3, PANC-1 and Capan-1)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 unit/mL penicillin
G and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate. Five-week-old
male nude mice were purchased from Charles River
Japan (Yokohama, Japan), which were housed in specific
pathogen-free conditions. The experimental protocols
were performed in accordance with the Care and Use

Untreated, treated, knockdown cells, and orthotopic
tumor specimens were lysed and their protein levels
were determined by immunoblotting, as previously
described [53]. The antibodies used in this study are
listed in Supplementary Table 2. Signals were detected
using an Immobilon Western horseradish peroxidase
substrate (Merck Millipore). Signals from tumor samples
were quantified using ImageJ software and their relative
intensities were calculated.

with intraperitoneal saline (n = 10) or 4 mg/kg AH6809/
GW627368X (n = 10) from the next day. After 35 days,
the mice were euthanized and their tumor lesions were
collected and weighed. Parts of the tumor specimens
were retained for immunoblotting and the remaining
tumor tissues were then fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered
formaldehyde.

IGF-1R signaling was assessed in IGF-1-stimulated
and AH6809/GW627368X-pretreated IGF-1-stimulated
BxPC-3 cells (5 × 106) using a Phospho Antibody
Array contract service (FullMoon BioSystems Inc;
Filgen, Nagoya, Japan). The protein phosphorylation
levels were normalized against the corresponding total
protein concentrations and the fold changes in AH6809/
GW627368X-pretreated IGF-1-stimulated BxPC-3 cells
were expressed relative to those in IGF-1-stimulated
BxPC-3 cells. The concentrations of IGF-1, AH6809, and
GW627368X were the same as those used in the growth
stimulation assays. Pretreatments and treatments were
performed for 3 h and 20 min, respectively.

Histological analyses
Formaldehyde-fixed tissues were embedded in
paraffin and sectioned at 4 µm. All of the sections were
subjected to H&E staining and immunohistochemical
staining for IGF-1 and Ki-67. Quantitative analyses were
performed by microscopically counting the numbers
of Ki-67-positive cells per field. The antibodies used
in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2. The
sections were blocked with 1% hydrogen peroxide in
50% methanol before probing with primary antibodies.
The antigens on the paraffin sections were then retrieved
by autoclaving in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10
min and visualized using a ChemMate Envision kit with
a horseradish peroxidase/3,3’-diaminobenzidine kit. All
sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin
(Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan).

RNA interference
BxPC-3 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were seeded onto
six-well plates and preincubated overnight at 37°C. The
following day, the cells were transfected with negative
universal control siRNA (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA), PKC-θ siRNA (ID SASI_Hs01_00239143; Sigma),
MAP4K3 siRNA (ID SASI_Hs02_00335960 and SASI_
Hs01_00040140; Sigma) and PDK1 siRNA (ID SASI_
Hs01_00094378 and SASI_Hs01_00044485; Sigma) using
lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. After transfection, we
analyzed the effects of AH6809/GW627368X on IGF1-stimulated cell growth and the activations of PKC-θ,
MEK, and ERK with a growth stimulation assay and
immunoblotting using the conditions and procedures
described above. Total RNA samples were isolated from
negative control siRNA- and PKC-θ siRNA-transfected
cells using RNeasy Mini kits, and aliquots (1 µg/sample)
were then subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The
conditions and procedures are previously described [53].
The levels of PKC-α, PKC-β, PKC-γ, PKC-δ, PKC-ε,
PKC-η, PKC-θ, PKC-ζ, and PKC-ι mRNA were quantified
using the primer sequences listed in Supplementary Table
1. β-actin mRNA was used as an internal standard.

Clinico-pathological analysis
Formaldehyde-fixed paraffin blocks from 23
surgically resected pancreatic cancers were obtained
from Tokushima University Hospital (2005-2011).
Serial sections (4 µm thickness) were cut and
immunohistochemical staining was performed for
IGF1R, EP2, EP4, MAP4K3, and PKC-θ. Pathologists
differentiated the slides as positive or negative for antigens
in a double-blinded test. The antibodies used in this study
are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Antigen retrieval,
visualization, and counterstaining were performed as
described above.

Statistical analysis

Orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice

The body weights, tumor weights, Ki-67-labeling
indices, and immunoblotting data were compared using
two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests. All other comparisons
were performed using two-tailed Student’s t-tests and the
differences were considered statistically significant when
P < 0.05.

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine
(1.8 and 0.8 mg/mouse, respectively) and surgery was
performed. Briefly, a small left flank incision was made
and the pancreas was exteriorized. Intrapancreatic
injections of BxPC-hmIGF1 cells (1.2 × 106 cells/
mouse) were then performed using a 30-gauge syringe.
To avoid intraperitoneal leakage of the cell suspensions,
the injected region was pressed with a sterilized cotton
swab for 10 s. Both layers of the abdominal wounds were
closed with wound clips. The mice were then treated daily
