ABSTRACT
Uncontrolled cell growth in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex occurs due to
inappropriate activation of mechanistic (mammalian) target of rapamycin complex
1 (mTORC1). The current therapy, rapamycin, produced promising clinical trial
results, but patient tumours regrow if treatment is discontinued, revealing rapamycin
has cytostatic properties rather than a cytotoxic effect. Taking advantage of the
enhanced levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress present in TSC2-null cells, we
investigated drug combinations producing a cytotoxic response. We found a nelfinavir
and salinomycin combination specifically killed TSC2-deficient, mTORC1 hyperactive
cells. Cytotoxicity was rescued by reducing protein synthesis, either through mTORC1
inhibition or cycloheximide treatment. This indicates that the drug combination targets
the cells by tipping the protein homeostasis balance of the already metabolically
stressed TSC2-deficient cells in favour of cell death. Furthermore, this drug
combination also inhibited tumour formation in TSC2-deficient cell models and caused
tumour spheroid death in 3D culture. Importantly, the 3D assay could differentiate the
cytostatic agent, rapamycin, from the cytotoxic nelfinavir/salinomycin combination.
Sporadic cancer cell lines with hyperactive mTORC1 signalling were also susceptible
to this nelfinavir/salinomycin drug combination. This work indicates that the protein
homeostasis pathway is an attractive therapeutic target in both Tuberous Sclerosis
Complex and mTORC1-driven sporadic cancers.

INTRODUCTION

such as phospho-S6K1 and phospho-ribosomal protein S6
(rpS6) [2, 3], while overexpression of mTORC1 substrates
are also strongly associated with prostate cancer [4].
mTORC1 upregulation in such cancers could be due to
mutations in a number of upstream oncogenes and tumour
suppressors, including those controlling the PI3K-Akt
or MAPK signalling pathways which both converge on
mTORC1. mTORC1 activation specifically through
TSC loss of function is seen in a proportion of bladder
cancer [5], hepatocellular carcinoma [6] and pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumours [7].
Rapamycin is an allosteric small molecule
inhibitor of mTORC1 and is an effective treatment for
TSC angiomyolipomas [8, 9]. However, it has been
shown that discontinuation of patient treatment leads to
tumour regrowth, indicating that rapamycin functions

The mechanistic (mammalian) target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth,
via its control of protein synthesis and other anabolic
pathways. The tumour suppressors, Tuberous Sclerosis
Complex (TSC)-1 and TSC2, lie upstream of mTORC1
and function together with TBC1D7 to negatively regulate
the mTORC1 activator, Ras homolog enriched in brain
(Rheb). Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 lead to the rare
genetic condition, TSC, where patients develop cysts and
tumours in multiple organs due to mTORC1 hyperactivity
and uncontrolled cell growth. mTORC1 signalling is also
inappropriately activated in a number of sporadic cancers
(reviewed in 1). For example, over half of breast cancers
demonstrate upregulated markers of mTORC1 activation,

as a cytostatic agent. Instead of inhibiting mTORC1,
an alternative strategy for TSC therapy is to exploit the
metabolic vulnerabilities of mTORC1 hyperactive cells,
which would instigate a cytotoxic response. For example,
TSC-deficient cells are highly sensitive to glucose
withdrawal and undergo glucose deprivation-induced death
[10]. Additionally, inhibition of glutaminase sensitises
TSC2-deficient cells to heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)
inhibition through a mechanism of increased oxidative
stress [11]. A potential therapeutic avenue is to exploit the
fact that mTORC1 hyperactive cells have enhanced basal
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, due to the elevated
levels of mTORC1-directed protein synthesis placing
a burden on the protein folding capacity of the ER. ER
stress activates a protective pathway termed the unfolded
protein response (UPR), which aims to downregulate
protein synthesis and restore protein folding in order
to restore cellular homeostasis. However, following
excessive ER stress over a prolonged period, apoptosis
is initiated [12]. A key player in the ER stress response
is C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, also called growth
arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153 (GADD153))
[13]. Upon acute ER stress, CHOP expression is strongly
enhanced through IRE1α- and PERK-mediated pathways.
If homeostasis is not restored and the levels of misfolded
proteins remain high, CHOP stimulates a transcriptional
programme that instigates cell death [12]. Amongst other
genes, CHOP directly activates expression of GADD34
[14], a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulator which
causes PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of eIF2α [15].
This releases the translational block, thereby enhancing
protein synthesis to activate death-associated mechanisms.
Further enhancing ER stress through treatment with ER
stress inducing drugs has been shown to selectively induce
the death of mTORC1 hyperactive cells [16].
Recently, salinomycin has been identified as a potent
mediator of breast cancer stem cell death [17]. Follow up
studies by other groups indicate that it also induces cell
death in bulk cancer cell lines [18-22]. Salinomycin is
a potassium ionophore, but the mechanism by which it
induces cell death is not yet clear, with unconventional
cell death pathways implicated in its mode of action [18].
Several cell signalling pathways are reported to be altered
following salinomycin treatment, including enhancement
of ER stress [21], inhibition of Wnt signalling [22] and an
impact on autophagy [23]. Salinomycin has been reported
to inhibit mTORC1 signalling in breast, prostate and
lung cancer cell lines [19, 21]. Interestingly, when CDH1
expression is inhibited in non-small cell lung carcinoma
cells, salinomycin induces more cell death than in their
wildtype counterparts as mTOR inhibition is alleviated
in these cells [21]. This work implies that cells with a
higher level of mTORC1 activity are more sensitive to the
cytotoxic drug action of salinomycin.
The current study tests the impact of salinomycin
treatment on mTORC1 hyperactive cells. We did this in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination with nelfinavir, as TSC2-deficient cells have
previously been reported to be selectively targeted by
nelfinavir treatment [16, 24]. Nelfinavir inhibits the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) retroviral protease and is
widely used to treat HIV infection. Studies have revealed
that nelfinavir can exert multiple cellular effects, such
as induction of autophagy and apoptosis in cancer cell
lines [25]. Herein, we examined the synergistic potential
of nelfinavir and salinomycin to selectively kill TSC2deficient cells and tested the dependence of mTORC1
hyperactivation as a sensitising mechanism of drug
cytotoxicity. We also employed 3D cell spheroid models to
measure tumour shrinkage post-drug treatment and further
examined the concept of cytotoxic versus cytostatic drug
action, using DRAQ7 as the unified signal readout of cell
viability across all the models from 2D to 3D. Our work
highlights the therapeutic potential of ER stress inducers
that show selective cytotoxicity in mTORC1 hyperactive
cells.

RESULTS
Combined nelfinavir and salinomycin treatment
induces ER stress
As both nelfinavir and salinomycin as single
agents have been reported to induce ER stress in other
cell lines [21, 25], we determined their impact alone
and in combination in both Tsc2-/- and Tsc2+/+ MEFs. To
examine the relative levels of ER stress burden, a series of
downstream ER stress markers were assessed after 6 h of
drug treatment. mRNA levels of CCAAT-enhancer-binding
protein homologous protein (CHOP), HSP70, and ER
degradation enhancer mannosidase alpha-like 1 (EDEM1)
were measured (Figure 1A-1C). Significantly higher basal
gene expression of these ER stress markers was observed
in the Tsc2-/- MEFs when compared to wild-type cells, as
previously reported [16, 31]. While nelfinavir enhanced
mRNA expression in both cells, mRNA expression was
elevated to a much higher level in the Tsc2-/- MEFs. As a
single agent, salinomycin induced an increase in CHOP
expression in both cell lines, but had little impact on
HSP70 or EDEM1 mRNA levels. Protein levels of IRE1α
and ATF4 were also elevated upon single or combined
treatment with nelfinavir and salinomycin (Figure 1D).
To further assess ER stress, we examined XBP1 splicing
(Figure 1E-1F). As part of the UPR during ER stress,
IRE1α catalyses the excision of an unconventional intron
within XBP1 mRNA that can be measured via PCR. In
the Tsc2-/- MEFs, the lower spliced XBP1 PCR product
(loss of 26 nucleotides) is the predominant XBP1 mRNA
form after nelfinavir treatment, while only 40 % (± 4 %)
of XBP1 mRNA was spliced in the wild-type controls.
Combined nelfinavir/salinomycin treatment caused a

further 16 % increase in XBP1 splicing in wild-type cells,
though could not further enhance the already high level of
XBP1 splicing seen in the nelfinavir treated Tsc2-/- MEFs.
This data demonstrates that nelvinavir and/or salinomycin
can induce a high level of ER stress in cells lacking Tsc2.

Salinomycin synergises with
selectively kill Tsc2-/- MEFs

nelfinavir

with nelfinavir and salinomycin did not induce cell
death in the Tsc2+/+ MEFs, which was equivalent to the
DMSO treated controls (at about 5% in both cases). To
further confirm that combined nelfinavir and salinomycin
treatment induced cytotoxicity as a consequence of Tsc2
loss, we utilised ELT3 cells. ELT3 cells are derived from
an Eker rat uterine leiomyoma that are Tsc2-null (referred
to as ‘ELT3-V3’). We compared these Tsc2-null cells to
a TSC2 re-expressing rescued control cell line (referred
to as ‘ELT3-T3’ [27]). As observed in the MEFs, ELT3
cells lacking Tsc2 displayed a higher level of cell death,
while the TSC2 re-expressing ELT3 cells better tolerated
nelfinavir and salinomycin as either single treatments or
when combined (Figure 2C-2D).
Having demonstrated that combined nelfinavir and
salinomycin treatment is effective at killing cells lacking
Tsc2, we next wanted to determine the property of drug
synergy between nelfinavir and salinomycin. To do this,
we treated both Tsc2-/- and Tsc2+/+ MEFs with a broad range
of drug concentrations of nelfinavir and salinomycin as
single agents and in combination. Cell death was similarly
assessed using flow cytometry and DRAQ7 labelling.

to

Extended periods of ER stress can lead to cellular
death if not efficiently restored [12]. To quantify cell death
after drug treatments, we carried out flow cytometry with
DRAQ7 (Figure 2A, graphed in Figure 2B). DRAQ7 is
a membrane impermeable far-red fluorescent dye which,
when membrane integrity is compromised, enters the cell
and binds readily to nuclear DNA to report cell death [32,
33]. As a single agent, salinomycin induces a moderate
percentage of cell death in the Tsc2-/- MEFs (25 % ± 2
%), while no apparent cytotoxicity was observed in the
wild-type controls. When nelfinavir was combined with
salinomycin, we observed a dramatic induction of cell
death in the Tsc2-/- MEFs. Of interest, combined treatment

The Tsc2-/- MEFs were observed to be acutely sensitive
to combined treatment with nelfinavir and salinomycin
and at much lower drug concentrations (Figure 2F),
while the Tsc2+/+ MEFs tolerated even the highest of drug

concentrations (Figure 2E). CompuSyn software was used
to calculate combination index (CI) values based on mean
cell death and is presented as a Chou-Talalay plot (Figure
2G). CI values below 1 indicate synergistic drug action

Nelfinavir and salinomycin induce cell death
through an increased protein synthesis burden

between nelfinavir and salinomycin. Importantly, we
found that nelfinavir and salinomycin acted in a synergistic
manner to kill Tsc2-/- MEFs, but no synergy was observed
in the Tsc2+/+ MEFs.

Studies in multiple cell lines have implicated
different mechanisms of salinomycin induced cell death
[18-22]. To elucidate which processes may be involved
in Tsc2-deficient cells, we firstly examined mTORC1 and
AMPK signalling. We found that as single agents, the
weak mTORC1 signalling in Tsc2 wild-type cells could be
inhibited, but neither drug alone impacted substantially on
S6K1, rpS6 or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in Tsc2-deficient
cells. The combination could reduce both phospho-4EBP1 and phospho-S6K1 levels in Tsc2-deficient cells after
24 h, together with the downstream substrate, phosphorpS6 (Figure 4A and also seen in Figure 3B). Interestingly,
the dual treatment also impacted the total levels of S6K1,
but only in the Tsc2-deficient cells. AMPK activity, as
measured via phospho-ACC, was elevated following
single or combination treatments (Figure 4A), indicating
enhanced energy stress following treatment. Nelfinavir
has previously been shown to impair the proteasome [34],
whereas salinomycin’s action appears to be independent of
the proteasome [18]. To assess how the drug combination
impacted the proteasome in our cells, we measured the
proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity (Figure 4B).

Nelfinavir and salinomycin dual treatment kills
cells in an mTORC1-dependent manner
To determine whether mTORC1 activation
following Tsc2 loss was responsible for the selective
sensitivity of the cells to nelfinavir/salinomycin dual
treatment (rather than via another TSC2 function), we
used rapamycin (an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor) to
block mTORC1 signalling. Treatment with rapamycin
substantially rescued cell death in the Tsc2-/- MEFs
(Figure 3A and graphed in Figure 3B). Inhibiting mTOR
also partially rescued nelfinavir and salinomycin induced
cell death in the ELT3-V3 cells (Figure 3C and graphed in
Figure 3D). This data indicates that hyperactive mTORC1
contributes to nelfinavir and salinomycin-induced
cytotoxicity.

μM nelfinavir (NFV) plus 5 μM salinomycin (Sal) combination for 24 h, with or without the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (Rap). Cell death
was assessed by flow cytometry and mTORC1 inhibition was determined by western blotting for phospho-S6K1 (T389) and phospho-4EBP1 (Ser65) A. and B. Similar analysis of ELT3 cells was performed following 48 h drug treatment, with phospho-S6K1 used as a readout
of mTORC1 activity C. and D. Graphs show an average of three independent replicates, mean +/- S.E.M. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

We generally observed a higher level of proteasome
activity in the Tsc2-/- MEFs, but there were no significant
changes to activity upon drug treatment, indicating that
nelfinavir/salinomycin-induced cell death is independent
of the proteasome. To determine if cell death involved
the classical caspase cascade, we analysed cleavage of

PARP and caspase 3. Salinomycin caused mild PARP and
caspase-3 cleavage in the Tsc2-/- MEFs as a single agent
that was not further enhanced upon nelfinavir treatment
(Supplementary Figure 1). This suggests an alternative,
non-classical cell death mechanism is largely responsible
for nelfinavir/salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity.

Tsc2+/+ and Tsc2-/- MEFs were lysed and protein levels of phosphorylated S6K1, rpS6, 4E-BP1 and ACC were determined by western
blot. Total TSC2, S6K1, rpS6, 4E-BP1, ACC and β-actin are shown as controls A.. The proteasome activity of drug treated samples was
determined by monitoring the turnover of the fluorescent chymotrypsin-like substrate B.. Samples prepared as in A were further analysed

shown at the same exposure C.. Tsc2+/+ and Tsc2-/- MEFs were pre-treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for 1 h, then treated with the indicated
combinations for 24 h. Cell death was assessed by flow cytometry D.. *** p < 0.001.

Levels of GADD34, which is upregulated in
response to ER stress, have been shown to correlate with
cell death [35] and GADD34 overexpression reduces cell

viability when combined with irradiation [36]. Therefore,
we assessed GADD34 levels in Tsc2 MEFs following drug
treatment. We found that nelfinavir strongly enhanced

images were taken and quantified C.. Spheroid diameter was determined from phase contrast images taken after 96 h drug treatment and
plotted against DRAQ7 staining intensity D.. Spheroids were then replated onto standard tissue culture plates and allowed to grow under
drug free conditions. Images were taken every 24 h and the area of outgrowth calculated using Image J E.. The scale bar represents 200 µm.

GADD34 expression, in keeping with an induction of ER
stress (Figure 4C). While salinomycin modestly enhanced
GADD34 levels as a single agent, combination treatment
showed a higher level of GADD34 expression than with
salinomycin alone. While increased GADD34 did not
completely correlate with cell death in Tsc2 MEFs, we
were interested to observe that rapamycin pre-treatment
of the cells prevented the upregulation of GADD34
seen in dual nelfinavir/salinomycin treated cells. This
could indicate that the reduction in cell death following
rapamycin treatment (Figure 3) is due to a reduced burden
of ER stress in these cells. In neurons, it was found that
GADD34 could reduce Akt phosphorylation [37]. As Akt
activation and the downstream phosphorylation of proteins
such as Foxo3a and BAD is viewed as pro-survival, we
assessed FOXO3a phosphorylation at the S256 Akt site.
We found that phospho-FOXO3a levels showed the
inverse pattern to GADD34 levels, being reduced in Tsc2/MEFs following combination nelfinavir/salinomycin
treatment and enhanced when cells were pre-treated to
inhibit mTORC1 prior to nelfinavir/salinomycin treatment
(Figure 4C). Similarly, the Akt-induced phospho-PRAS40
site (Thr246) and phospho-BAD site (Ser136) were
increased with rapamycin pre-treatment compared to
nelfinavir/salinomycin treatment alone. This suggests that
high ER stress induced through nelfinavir/salinomycin
treatment of mTORC1 hyperactive cells correlates with
a decrease in pro-survival Akt signalling, which could be
one of the mechanisms by which the treatments induce
cell death.
The ER stress responsive proteins, ATF4 and CHOP,
have been shown to cause increased protein synthesis,
leading to a reduction in cell survival [38]. As we observed
nelfinavir and salinomycin enhanced CHOP mRNA
expression (Figure 1A) and ATF4 protein levels (Figure
1D), we investigated whether the enhanced burden of
protein synthesis present in Tsc2-deficient cells combined
with the treatment-induced elevation of CHOP and ATF4
could play a role in causing cell death. Pharmacological
inhibition of protein synthesis using cycloheximide
substantially rescued ( > 60 %) nelfinavir/salinomycin
induced Tsc2-deficient cell death (Figure 4D), which was
comparable to rapamycin (Figure 3).

Combined treatment of salinomycin with nelfinavir was
equally as potent at reducing tumour formation. Due to
the longer time period of the experiment compared to the
monolayer cultures, we found that lower concentrations
of both drugs were effective at causing cell death in
our 3D systems. We next wanted to assess whether
established spheroids were also sensitive to nelfinavir and
salinomycin. To do this, Tsc2-/- MEF tumour spheroids
were allowed to form over 72 h and then treated for 4
days with either DMSO, nelfinavir/salinomycin, or
rapamycin. Spheroids were stained with DRAQ7 to
measure the relative levels of cell death (Figure 5C). We
observed distinct tumour spheroid populations after both
nelfinavir/salinomycin or rapamycin treatments, with
marked differences in DRAQ7 staining intensity as well
as relative spheroid area (Figure 5D). While rapamycin
caused a marked reduction in spheroid size, there was
little apparent cell death, as observed by a slight increase
in DRAQ7 staining that was not significantly different
to untreated cells (DMSO). In contrast to rapamycin,
dual nelfinavir and salinomycin treatment caused a
slight increase in spheroid size due to the development
of a more uneven spheroid surface. Furthermore, there
was a significant level of cell death after nelfinavir and
salinomycin treatment, as observed by a high level of
DRAQ7 staining within the tumour core (Figure 5C).
After cessation of drug treatment and re-plating into
adherent plates, we measured outgrowth of cells from
these spheroids (Figure 5E). This provided another readout
of tumour recovery and long-term pharmacodynamics
consequence of the original drug treatment. Of note,
we observed cell outgrowth from spheroids that were
previously treated with rapamycin, revealing a significant
degree of cell recovery. This property, combined with low
levels of cell death, indicates that rapamycin is acting as a
cytostatic agent. As no cell outgrowth was observed over
the 72 h period from the spheroids previously treated with
nelfinavir and salinomycin, this drug combination has
cytotoxic properties throughout the entire spheroid. This
experiment was repeated using ELT3-V3 cells (Figure 5F5H), revealing an identical pattern and supporting the view
that nelfinavir/salinomycin is a cytotoxic combination to
TSC2-deficient spheroids.

Nelfinavir and salinomycin show cytotoxity
towards Tsc2-null tumour spheroid models while
rapamycin acts as a cytostatic agent

Sporadic cancers with hyperactive mTORC1
are also killed by dual nelfinavir/salinomycin
treatment

To determine whether the drug combination was
successful in a 3D setting, we next tested nelfinavir
and salinomycin within Tsc2-deficient tumour spheroid
model systems. We observed that salinomycin as a single
agent could markedly block tumour spheroid formation
of Tsc2-/- MEFs in soft agar (Figure 5A) as well as TSCpatient derived AML cells that also lack Tsc2 (Figure 5B).

As our data indicates that blockade of mTORC1
signalling allows cells to evade nelfinavir/salinomycininduced death, it follows that other cell types with high
levels of mTORC1 activity should also be sensitive to the
drug combination. To test this concept further, we utilised
two cell lines with basally high mTORC1 signalling
(Figure 6): the NCI-H460 large cell lung cancer cell

DISCUSSION

line which has PI3KCA, CDKN2A, STK11 and KRAS
mutations [39] and the HCT116 colorectal cancer cell
line, which contains an activating RAS mutation [40] and
PIK3CA mutation [41]. In both cell lines, dual nelfinavir/
salinomycin treatment significantly enhanced cell death.
The addition of rapamycin to combined treatment rescued
33-57 % of cell death (Figure 6A-6B). We also observed
a strong induction of GADD34 expression in both cell
lines with dual nelfinavir/salinomycin treatment, which
was substantially reduced with rapamycin treatment. This
implies that an increased ER stress burden may contribute
to cell death in these mTORC1 hyperactive sporadic
cancers.

Our work shows that targeting the ER stress
vulnerability of mTORC1 hyperactive cells has promise
for the eradication of such cells in Tuberous Sclerosis
Complex and cancer. We found that nelfinavir and
salinomycin act synergistically to selectively kill Tsc2null MEFs, while normal cells with intact Tsc2 tolerate
treatment (Figure 2). Cytotoxicity is not through the
classical apoptotic caspase cascade as minimal PARP
and caspase 3 cleavage were observed following dual
drug treatment. This fits with a previous report where
a non-classical mechanism of cell death was observed
following salinomycin treatment in other cell types [18].

Additionally, as Tsc2 MEFs are TP53-null, our data
indicates that nelfinavir/salinomycin induced cell death is
independent of p53, fitting with a previous study where
salinomycin showed cytotoxic properties in TP53-null
Jurkat cells [18]. Salinomycin’s mode of action is also
not through proteasomal inhibition, as it did not impact
proteasomal turnover (Figure 4B), supporting the findings
of others [18].
Regulation of protein synthesis and cell death have
been linked previously [38, 42], with ATF4 and CHOP
reported to have important roles. A block in protein
synthesis through knockdown of ribosomal genes or
pharmacological inhibition has been shown to increase
cell viability in ATF4/CHOP over-expressing cells [38].
When we inhibited protein synthesis by downregulating
mTORC1 signalling with rapamycin (Figure 3) or by
using cycloheximide (Figure 4D), we were able to
significantly rescue nelfinavir/salinomycin induced cell
death. Other studies have shown that increased protein
synthesis leads to ATP depletion [38] and in accordance
with this, we observe an elevation of AMPK signalling
following nelfinavir/salinomycin dual treatment (Figure
4A). We also observed an increase in phosphorylation of
the pro-survival Akt substrates FOXO3a, PRAS40 and
BAD [43], together with a reduction in ER stress burden,
as measured by GADD34 expression, when mTORC1
was inhibited in TSC2-null MEFs prior to dual nelfinavir/
salinomycin treatment (Figure 4C). This suggests that high
protein synthesis resulting in low cellular energy levels
and decreased survival signalling could be one pathway
responsible for sensitising TSC2-null cells to nelfinavir/
salinomycin induced death.
There is much interest in the potential use of
salinomycin in humans following its identification as an
agent which could target cancer stem cells [17]. Although
a review article highlighted two promising case reports
of its use in cancer patients who had exhausted other
therapeutic options [44], salinomycin is unlikely to rapidly
translate to clinical use as there is a lack of mammalian
safety data and previous reports indicate severe toxicity
following accidental human exposure [45]. While some
new salinomycin esters and diastereoisomers have been
synthesised which also exhibit anti-cancer properties [46,
47], they still show evidence of neurotoxicity in mice.
Currently, the specific protein target of salinomycin is
unknown. Should it be uncovered, it may be possible to
target the signalling pathway with an alternative drug,
which in combination with nelfinavir, could prove to be
a clinically viable combination with specificity for killing
mTORC1 hyperactive cells.
In this study, 3D colony formation and spheroid
assays permitted us to determine whether the nelfinavir/
salinomycin induced cell death we observed in monolayer
cell culture could be replicated in a more physiological
3D model, an important step in pre-clinical drug testing.
We found salinomycin either alone, or in combination

with nelfinavir, effectively blocked colony formation in
soft agar (Figure 5A-5B). Rapalogues, the current therapy
for TSC, result in a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic
clinical response. Our 3D spheroid system depicts this
shortcoming of using rapamycin to treat TSC patient
tumours, as growth recovery was apparent upon its
removal, showing that rapamycin is a cytostatic agent
(Figure 5). In contrast to rapamycin, dual nelfinavir/
salinomycin treatment caused complete tumour death
(Figure 5). This data clearly shows that the nelfinavir
and salinomycin drug combination is highly cytotoxic to
mTORC1 hyperactive cells.
This work also highlights the essential steps of using
3D culture models in dissecting the pharmacodynamic
consequences on TSC tumours. The nelfinavir/
salinomycin combination did not shrink the spheroid
size, unlike rapamycin, and so in other tumour models
may have been discarded as an ineffective therapy.
However, by embedding the non-toxic viability label,
DRAQ7, directly into the treatment timecourse, combined
with the additional validation of the outgrowth assay,
it was clear that the cells forming these spheroids were
no longer viable. In contrast, the rapamycin treated
spheroids immediately began to regrow following drug
removal. This spheroid assay shows the importance of
discriminating between cytostatic treatments and those
which are likely to bring about a long-lasting cytotoxic
response, making it an innovative and useful screening
tool for future TSC therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue culture and drug treatments
Tsc2+/+ p53-/- and Tsc2-/- p53-/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) were a kind gift from David
Kwiatkowski (Harvard University, Boston, USA) in
2004 and have been previously characterised [26]. Eker
rat leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient ELT3-V3 cells
and matching control TSC2-expressing ELT3-T3 cells
generated in Astrinidis et al, 2002 [27], were kindly
provided in 2006 by Cheryl Walker (M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center, Houston, USA). Human lung carcinoma
(NCI-H460) cells were purchased from ATCC in 2012
while HCT116 cells were provided in 2015 by Nick Leslie
(Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh). All cell lines were
mycoplasma free and regularly tested for mycoplasma
infection using the Venor GeM Classic PCR kit from
CamBio. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10 %
(v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and
100 µ/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley,
UK) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5 % (v/v) CO2.
Angiomyolipoma (AML) cells 621-102 were a kind gift

from Elizabeth Henske (Brigham and Women’s Hospital,
Boston, U.S.A.) in 2013 and were cultured as above, but
in media containing 15% FBS. Cell lines were cultured
for no more than 3 months following their initial thawing.
Nelfinavir mesylate hydrate, salinomycin (ready-made
solution) and rapamycin were purchased from SigmaAldrich Company Ltd. (Dorset, UK). Nelfinavir and
rapamycin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and further diluted in culture medium to the required
concentrations before use. Nelfinavir and salinomycin
concentrations were chosen based on solubility and dose
response curves carried out in Tsc2 MEFs.

acquisition. Autofluorescence of unstained cells provided
the background readout across all samples. Correlated
signals were collected for a minimum of 10,000 events.
Events were gated and analysed using FlowJo software
(Oregon, USA).

Synergy analysis using compuSyn
Cell viability obtained through flow cytometry
analysis was inputted into CompuSyn software
(ComboSyn, Inc, [29]) to obtain Combination Index
(CI) values using a non-constant ratio approach. Flow
cytometry values used were the mean of three independent
experiments.

Western blotting and antibodies

Proteasome assay

Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris,
pH 7.5, 135 mM NaCl, 5% [v/v] glycerol, 50 mM NaF,
0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors),
centrifuged and protein quantified using Bradford reagent
(Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were made up in NuPAGE
LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies). Western blotting
was performed as previously described [28]. Blots shown
are representative of 3 independent experiments. Anti-βactin (#4967), phospho-TSC2 S1387 (#5584), total TSC2
(#3990), IRE1α (3294S), phospho-S6K1 T389 (#9205),
total S6K1 (#9202), phospho-rpS6 S235/236 (#2211),
total rpS6 (#2217), phospho-4E-BP1 S65 (#9451), total
4E-BP1 (#9644), phospho-ACC S79 (#3661), total
ACC (#3676), PARP (#9542), caspase 3 (#9662), ATF4
(#11815), phospho-FOXO3a (#9466S), total FOXO3a
(#9467), phospho-PRAS40 T246 (#2997), total PRAS40
(#2691) and phospho-Bad S136 (#4366) antibodies were
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).
GADD34 antibody (10449-1-AP) was from Proteintech
(Manchester, UK).

Proteasomes were extracted from live cells 2
h post-treatment according to a previously described
protocol [30]. Chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity
was assessed using the fluorogenic substrate Succ-LLVYAMC (Sigma). Assays were performed as described
(Crawford et al, 2006), with the rate of substrate turnover
determined by monitoring the fluorescence of released
aminomethylcoumarin using a multiwell plate reader
(FLUOstar Optima, BMG Labtech) at an excitation
wavelength of 395 nm and emission wavelength of 460
nm over a period of 35 min.

Soft agar assays
Two-layered soft agar assays were performed in 6
well plates using a base layer of 0.6 % agar in standard
culture media. Tsc2-/- MEFs or AML 621-102 cells (1.5
x 105 cells per well) were suspended in a top layer of 0.3
% (w/v) agar. Complete media containing the indicated
treatments was added the following day. Cultures were
grown for 11 days, with media (and drug treatments)
replaced every 2-3 days. Images were taken using an
EVOS XL Core camera (Life Technologies).

RNA extraction, Q-PCR and XBP1 splicing
This was performed as described previously [16]
with the additional use of HSP70 and EDEM1 real time
Quantitect PCR primers which were obtained from Qiagen
(West Sussex, United Kingdom).

3D spheroids and outgrowth

Flow cytometry

Tsc2-/- MEFs or ELT3-V3 cells were plated at 1000
cells/well into a 96-well plate, precoated with 1.5 %
(w/v) agarose. Spheroids were allowed to form for 72 h
before treatment with DMSO, 10 µM nelfinavir and 2 µM
salinomycin or 25 nM rapamycin. Fresh media and drugs,
including DRAQ7 (which is non-toxic), were added by
removal and replacement of 50 % of the media volume
after 60 h, and incubated for a further 36 h (total 96 h
treatment incubation). Dual channel images were acquired
using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss
Microimaging, Gottingen, Germany) with a black box

To measure cell death prevalence in the population,
drug treated cells were trypsinised from 24 well plates and
incubated with 3 µM DRAQ7TM (Biostatus Ltd, Shepshed,
UK) for 10 min at 37 ˚C. Flow cytometry was performed
using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson,
Cowley, UK) using excitation at 488 nm and detection of
fluorescence in log mode at wavelengths greater than 695
nm (far red). Cell Quest Pro software (Beckton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems) was used for signal

chamber (Solent Scientific Ltd, Segensworth, U.K.) at 0
and 96 h timepoints. Spheroid size (transmission mode)
and DRAQ7 labelling (fluorescence excitation 488nm/
emission above 695nm) were assessed using MetaMorph
acquisition software. Following imaging, spheroids were
transferred to a standard, tissue culture coated 24 well plate
with fresh culture media (no drug treatments) and imaged
using an EVOS XL Core camera (Life Technologies) after
0, 24, 48 and 72 h. Total outgrowth area from the spheroid
was measured using ImageJ (v1.50i) software (https://
imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

RJE is non-executive director of Biostatus Ltd, the
vendor of DRAQ7.
