ABSTRACT
Glioma stemness has been recognized as the most important reason for
glioma relapse and drug resistance. Differentiation of glioma stem cells (GSCs)
has been implicated as a novel approach to target recurrent glioma. However, the
detailed molecular mechanism involved in the differentiation of GSCs has not yet
been elucidated. This study identified CPEB1 as the key modulator that induces the
differentiation of GSCs at the post-transcriptional level. Gain and loss of function
experiments showed that CPEB1 expression reduced sphere formation ability and the
expression of stemness markers such as Nestin and Notch. To elucidate the detailed
molecular mechanism underlying the action of CPEB1, we investigated the interacting
ribonome of the CPEB1 complex using a Ribonomics approach. CPEB1 specifically
suppressed the translation of HES1 and SIRT1 by interacting with a cytoplasmic
polyadenylation element. The expression profile of CPEB1 negatively correlated with
overall survival in glioma patients. Overexpression of CPEB1 decreased the number
of GSCs in an orthotopically implanted glioma animal model. These results suggest
that CPEB1-mediated translational control is essential for the differentiation of GSCs
and provides novel therapeutic concepts for differentiation therapy.

INTRODUCTION

regarded as responsible for tumor initiation, progression,
invasion, recurrence, and drug resistance [3]. CSCs are
a subpopulation of cells in the tumor that have selfrenewal capacity and can give rise to the various cells that
comprise these tumors [4]. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) were
the first cancer stem cell isolated from solid tumors [5].
Whereas one million non-GSCs were needed to generate
parental tumors when implanted into immunodeficient
mice, as few as 100 GSCs were required [5]. The existence
of GSCs provided a plausible explanation for glioma
recurrence following treatment. CD133+ GSCs were found
to be more resistant to radiation in vitro than CD133- cells

The degree of glioma malignancy is graded using
a World Health Organization (WHO) consensus-derived
scale of I to IV, as determined by histological features and
genetic alterations [1]. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM),
the most common and biologically aggressive form of
WHO grade IV gliomas, has increased in incidence and
has a very poor prognosis, with an average survival of only
14~16 months despite maximal therapy [1, 2]. Treatment
failure may be due to the inability of currently available
therapies to eliminate cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are

because of induction of DNA repair pathways [6]. In
addition, GSCs were found to overexpress ATP-binding
cassette transporters (ABCTs) such as ATP-binding
cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) to export the
chemotherapeutic agent extracellularly [7].
Tumors may be treated by inducing the
differentiation of CSCs. Transient in vitro exposure of
GSCs to BMP4, which induces astroglial differentiation,
abolishes their tumor initiating and infiltrating potential
[8]. Thus, treatments can be designed to induce the
differentiation of CSCs into more differentiated
cancer cells, which lose the ability to self-renew and
can respond to current therapy [9]. To date, only two
anticancer drug categories have been found to affect
cancer cell differentiation: retinoic acid and drugs that
target tumor epigenetic factors [9]. Although induction
of differentiation with all-trans retinoic acid has been
successful in the treatment of acute promyelocytic
leukemia, it has limited benefit in the treatment of
solid tumors, suggesting that differentiation therapy in
solid tumors may involve more complicated molecular
mechanisms than promyelocytic leukemia [10]. These
findings further support the importance of identifying
molecular mechanisms of CSC differentiation in gliomas.
CPEB1 is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein
that specifically binds to a conserved RNA sequence
called the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE).
The CPE is usually found in the 3′ untranslated region
(3′UTR) of several key mRNAs in vertebrate germ
cells, embryos, and neurons [11-13]. CPEB1, along with
other cellular factors, is indirectly responsible for both
translational repression and activation through regulation
of polyadenylation. The CPEB1 homolog Xenopus laevis
CPEB accomplishes these tasks through its association
with several key partners, including CPSFs [14, 15],
Maskin [16], Symplekin [17], Gld2 [13, 17], PARN
[18], and ePAB [19]. Frog and mouse proteins induce the
cytoplasmic polyadenylation of dormant mRNAs with
short poly(A) tails, resulting in their translation during
early developmental stages [12, 20]. Recently, the level
of CPEB1 was increased during neural differentiation,
with CPEB1 having a developmental role as an inducer
of differentiation [21, 22]. Furthermore, CPEB1 has been
implicated as a tumor suppressor in many solid tumors
[23, 24].
Based on these observations, we hypothesized that
regulation of CPEB1 expression may be critical for the
differentiation of GSCs. Using loss and gain of function
experiments, we assessed the functional significance of
CPEB1 in GSCs by analyzing the CPEB1 target ribonome
to elucidate the molecular details of CPEB1-mediated
regulation of GSC stemness.

CPEB1 expression is inversely correlated with
glioma stemness and overall survival of glioma
patients
To examine the possible role of CPEB1 in glioma
malignancy, we analyzed the expression profile from
the REMBRANDT (REpository for Molecular BRAin
Neoplasia DaTa) database. CPEB1 expression was
significantly lower in tumor samples from 148 patients
with astrocytoma, 67 with oligodendroglioma, and 228
with GBM, than in 28 non-tumor brain tissue samples
(Figure 1A). Overall survival was significantly longer
in glioma patients with intermediate than low levels of
CPEB1 expression (p = 0.0111; Figure 2B).
Due to the downregulation of CPEB1 expression
in human gliomas, we assayed the levels of CPEB1
expression in patient-derived GSCs cultured in serumfree stemness and serum-containing differentiation
media. GSCs lost stemness when cultured in the presence
of serum [25]. Cells cultured in serum-containing media
showed higher CPEB1 mRNA and protein expression,
along with high levels of expression of differentiation
markers (GFAP, S100β, and Tuj1) and low levels of
stemness markers (Nestin, Sox2, CD133) (Figures 1C and
1D). These results indicated that CPEB1 may function as
a differentiation inducer in human GSCs.

CPEB1 suppresses stemness and self-renewal
ability of GSCs
Because CPEB1 expression was increased when
GSCs were cultured under differentiation conditions, we
examined the functional role of CPEB1 in the stemness
and self-renewal of GSCs. Since sphere formation assay
and neural stemness markers such as Nestin and Notch
are widely used to assess the self-renewal capacity and
stemness of GSCs, we examined sphere formation ability
and the expression of Nestin and Notch intracellular
domain (NICD) in CPEB1-modulated GSCs [26, 27].
CPEB1 overexpression resulted in a dramatic reduction in
expression of Nestin and NICD, as well as a reduction of
the efficiency of sphere formation (Figures 2A and 2B). In
contrast, CPEB1 depletion from CSC2 cells significantly
increased Nestin expression, Notch1 cleavage, and the
efficiency of sphere formation (Figures 2C and 2D).
Importantly, GFAP expression positively correlated with
CPEB1 but not Tuj1, suggested that CPEB1 induced
differentiation of GSCs into astrocyte (Figures 2A and
2C). These results indicate that CPEB1 may suppress GSC
self-renewal by inducing differentiation.

Identification of CPEB1-associated transcripts by
Ribonomics approach

attempted to immunoprecipitate SFS-CPEB1 with several
proteins known to interact with CPEB, such as Symplekin
[17], CPSFs [14, 15], and Aurora A (AURKA) [15].
293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids
encoding SFS-CPEB1 and HA-tagged-Aurora A (HAAURKA) (Figure 3A). Expressed SFS-CPEB1 protein
was specifically pulled down from cell lysates with antiFLAG-M2 affinity gels. Subsequently, Western blot (WB)
was performed with antibodies against the Symplekin,
CPSF100, and HA-tag to detect specific protein-protein
interactions. We found that SFS-CPEB1 formed a
correct protein complex, indicating that SFS-CPEB1 is
functionally active in cells (Figure 3A).
Using a Ribonomics strategy [29], we next attempted
to identify a subset of transcripts that are potential targets
of CPEB1 at the post-transcriptional level. WB of a stable
clone expressing SFS-CPEB1 yielded a positive outcome
at the expected molecular weight, whereas control cells
were negative for this protein (Figure 3C). Using a SFSCPEB1 expressing stable CPEB1 cell line, associated
mRNPs were tandem affinity purified by sequential SBP
and S-protein affinity chromatography (Figures 3B and

As shown in Figure 2, CPEB1 suppressed selfrenewal of GSCs. CPEB1 acts as a sequence specific
RNA-binding protein. Moreover, CPEB1 acts to regulate
polyadenylation and translation of target mRNAs, a
mechanism critical for gene expression regulation.
Systematic identification of CPEB1 affected target
transcripts potentially involved in GSC self-renewal is
therefore critical to understanding of exact regulation
mechanism.
To identify target transcripts potentially modulated
by CPEB1 in cells, we purified CPEB1-containing
messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) complexes
from 293T cells, which stably express CPEB1 with an
N-terminal tandem affinity purification tag, consisting
of an S-tag (S), double FLAG epitopes (F), and a
streptavidin-binding peptide (S) [28]. To test the activity
of this SFS-tagged CPEB1 (SFS-CPEB1) in the formation
of mRNPs and its association with target transcripts, we

HA-AURKA were ectopically expressed in 293T cells. SFS-CPEB1 was precipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and the WB was
performed with Symplekin, CPSF100, HA-tag, FLAG-tag, and β-Actin (negative binding control) specific antibodies, respectively. (B)

RNAs were eluted from S-protein beads. The eluted RNAs were used for cDNA library construction. X represents nonspecifically interacting
protein. (C) Stable cell lines expressing SFS and SFS-CPEB1 were harvested and lysed, and the levels of individual samples were detected

agarose gels. After IP of RNA-protein complexes, RNAs were isolated and used in semi-quantitative RT-PCR reactions with specific
oligomers for SIRT1, bFGF2, VEGFA, HES1, and GAPDH (negative binding control). The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel.

Precipitates of the SFS-CPEB1 expressing stable
CPEB1 cell line contained a detectable amount of total
RNA, whereas the control cell line did not (Supplementary
Figure S1A). The RNAs were used to construct a CPEBassociated transcript cDNA library, which was analyzed
for the presence of essential cis-acting elements [CPE,
Pumilio binding site (Pum), and hexanucleotide (HEX)]
for cytoplasmic polyadenylation-translation control within
the 3'UTR region of each clone [30]. Independently, we
also analyzed several genes [vascular endothelial growth
factor A (VEGFA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor
beta polypeptide (PDGFRB), sirtuin1 (SIRT1), catenin

beta-1 (CTNNB1), and basic fibroblast growth factor 2
(bFGF2)] essential for the proliferation and differentiation
of GSCs [31-36] through the CPE prediction algorithm
[30]. All of these genes were highly conserved and
contained strong cis-acting elements in their 3'UTR
regions (Supplementary Figure S2).
By using a Ribonomics strategy, from the 450
randomly picked clones, 108 had successful reads,
representing 46 types of CPEB1-associated transcripts
(Table 1). These transcripts included nine ribosomal
protein genes (20%), 32 single represented genes (70%),
and five unclassified entries (10%). When the molecular
functions of these genes were classified using the DAVID
6760

Bioinformatics Resource and a SOURCE search, we found
that most of the CPEB1-associated transcripts encode
genes involved in various cellular pathways, including
ubiquitination-related genes, genes encoding structural
constituents of the ribosome, metabolic enzymes,
translation initiation factors, and cellular chaperones,
as well as encoding proteins involved in transcriptional
regulation, including hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1)
and YY1-associated factor 2 (YAF2) (Table 1).
Specific interactions between CPEB1 and some
of identified transcripts were confirmed using mRNPimmunoprecipitation (IP) experiments (Figure 3D). 293T
cells were transfected with plasmids encoding SFSCPEB1; FLAG-IP and semi-quantitative RT-PCR were
then performed. As expected, VEGF, PDGFRB, SIRT1,
bFGF2, and HES1, but not GAPDH, mRNAs were
specifically co-precipitated with SFS-CPEB1 (Figure 3D).

These results further indicated that SFS-CPEB1 formed
the mRNP complex and confirmed that SFS-CPEB1 is
functional in cells.

CPEB1 modulates translation of identified target
transcripts
To assess the role of CPEB1 in regulating the
identified target transcripts, we generated Renilla
luciferase constructs (sensors), which contain the 3'UTR
sequence of the target ribonome [18, 19]. All identified
transcripts contained the cis-elements (CPE and HEX)
essential for CPEB1-mediated polyadenylation and
translation control (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure
S2).
To examine the activity of various sensors after

at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate (*p<0.05 and **p<0.01). Error bars in the graph represent mean ± s.e.m. and

CPEB1 expression, CPEB1-GFP and Renilla luciferase
ribonome 3'UTR-encoding plasmids were cotransfected
into 293T cells. As expected, expression of CPEB1-GFP
but not GFP repressed the activity of all wild type sensors
(Figure 4B). However, the sensor containing the CPE null
Xenopus laevis cyclin B1 (xCCNB1) 3'UTR construct
showed no response to CPEB1 expression [19]. These
data strongly suggest that CPEB1 modulates translation
of identified target ribonome through its association with
the CPE element present in the 3'UTR sequence in cells.

(Figure 5C). In contrast, CPEB1 depletion in CSC2
resulted in dramatic increases in both SIRT1 and HES1
expression (Figure 5D), whereas CPEB1 overexpression
or depletion did not alter the expression of SIRT1 and
HES1 mRNAs (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that the
regulation occurred at the posttranscriptional level. Taken
together, these findings indicate that CPEB1 functions as
a translational repressor of SIRT1 and HES1 expression
in GSCs.

CPEB1 overexpression inhibits tumorigenicity of
CSC2

CPEB1 regulates translation of HES1 and SIRT1
mRNAs

Since CPEB1 induced differentiation and suppressed
self-renewal ability of GSCs, we next examined its antitumorigenic activity in an in vivo mouse model. CPEB1overexpressed GSCs, labeled with GFP, were injected
into nude mouse brains. Six weeks later, the mice were
sacrificed and brain samples were stained for GFP and
Nestin. Tumor cells in control mice were positive for
Nestin expression, but no signal was detected in mice
injected with CPEB1-overexpressing GSCs (Figure 6A).
GFP signals were strongly detected in the corpus callosum
region of mice injected with control but not CPEB1overexpressing GSCs (Figure 6B), strongly suggesting
that CPEB1 suppressed the tumorigenicity of GSCs by
inducing cell differentiation.

In our data, NICD expression is regulated by
CPEB1 overexpression or knockdown, and interestingly
Ribonomic identified transcript HES1 is one of the target
genes for Notch signaling [37, 38]. SIRT1, a NAD+dependent histone deacetylase, is implicated in multiple
biologic processes, by the modification of transcription
factors. Interestingly, SIRT1 is considered as an oncogene
that supports the survival of CSCs in various cancers.
Therefore, we further analyzed whether HES1 and SIRT1
are potential target candidates regulated by CPEB1 at the
posttranscriptional level in GSCs.
When cells were cultured in the presence of serum,
high CPEB1 expression was inversely correlated with
the levels of SIRT1 and HES1 proteins in GSCs (Figures
5A and 5B). Furthermore, CPEB1 overexpression
significantly decreased SIRT1 and HES1 expression

DISCUSSION

suppression by CPEB1 is still undetermined, we found
that HES1 and SIRT1 were targets of CPEB1-mediated
translational control. These results provide strong evidence
that CPEB1 is a potent differentiation modulator of GSCs.
Recent research has highlighted the importance
of CSCs in glioma malignancy [44-46]. GSCs with a
potency of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation
play an important role in glioma initiation, growth, and
recurrence [47-50]. Eliminating GSCs from the bulk
tumor mass may be an effective therapeutic strategy [5,
51]. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand the
signaling pathways that contribute to the formation and
maintenance of GSCs. Notch has been strongly implicated
as a major signal in GSC maintenance. Expression of
Notch regulators was found to correlate significantly
with glioma grade, as well as being prognostic in glioma
patients. Targeting Notch signaling was found to greatly
reduce the self-renewal activity of GSCs. We found that
HES1, a major downstream transcription factor for Notch
signaling, was a target of CPEB1. These results indicate
a novel mechanism of Notch regulation in GSCs and
further support the functional significance of CPEB1 as
an inducer of GSC differentiation.
SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase,
has been implicated in multiple biologic processes, by
modifying many transcription factors, including TP53,
NF-κB/p65, and FOXOs [39]. SIRT1 was recently
found to be overexpressed and/or catalytically activated
in tumor cells, suggesting that SIRT1 acts as a tumor
promoter [40]. Moreover, Overexpression of SIRT1 has
been shown to maintain CSC characteristics in different
cancers. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), SIRT1
overexpression was detected in CD34+ stem cells and
implicated to increase CD34+ cell survival by suppressing

The results of the present study indicate that CPEB1
functions as a potent inducer of GSC differentiation.
CPEB1 overexpression decreased the self-renewal
activities of GSCs, as well as downregulating stemness
marker expression. Using CPEB1-associated ribonome
analysis and the CPE prediction algorithm, we identified
many CPEB1-related transcripts, including SIRT1 and
HES1. Moreover, we found that translational control of
these genes by CPEB1 regulates GSC self-renewal. The
overall survival of glioma patients positively correlated
with the level of CPEB1. Moreover, the concerted gain
of function of CPEB1 in GSCs was found to suppress
tumorigenesis and infiltrating phenotypes in an in vivo
mouse model.
CPEB1 was shown to be a protein required for
tumor development and may act as a tumor suppressor.
The highest level of CPEB1 mRNA is observed in the
reproductive system and brain, with reduced expression of
CPEB1 mRNA in cancers of these tissues [23, 24]. Levels
of CPEB1 are also decreased in other types of human
tumors, including myeloma, gastric, breast, ovarian, and
colorectal cancers [23, 24, 41, 42]. Reduced level of
CPEB1 has been associated with the capacity of malignant
cells to promote invasion and angiogenesis. Initially a
lack of CPEB1 mediated cell immortalization, bypassing
senescence of knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts [43].
Moreover in carcinogenesis assay, papilloma formation
was significantly faster in CPEB1 knockout than in wildtype animals [43]. Taken together, these results suggest
that CPEB1 is a potential tumor suppressor and lack of
CPEB1 potentially increases susceptibility to cancer.
Although the precise mechanism of tumor

TP53-mediated apoptosis of CML CSCs [52]. Therefore,
the CPEB1-mediated down-regulation of SIRT1 may be a
novel molecular mechanism by which SIRT1 is involved
in GSC differentiation. CPEB1 may be functionally
significant as a regulatory hub to suppress HES1 and
SIRT1 translation.
CPEB1-overexpressing CSC2 showed significantly
decreased proliferation and infiltration in a xenograft
model, especially within the corpus callosum. CPEB1
induced differentiation of GSCs in mouse glioma model.
Strikingly, these results are equivalent to glioma patient
survival in REMBRANDT database. Patients with
CPEB1 down-regulation have a significantly shorter
overall survival than patients with intermediate levels
of CPEB1 expression (p = 0.0111). Moreover, the level
of CPEB1 mRNA is lower in gliomas (astrocytomas,
oligodendrocytomas, and GBM) than in non-tumor brain
tissue, further suggesting that CPEB1 plays a role as a
tumor suppressor in glioma by inducing the differentiation
of GSCs. These results suggest that CPEB1-mediated
translational control is essential for the differentiation of
GSCs and further provide novel therapeutic concepts for
differentiation therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
293T cells was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (HyClone). GSCs (X01 [53], CSC2)
were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with B27
(Invitrogen), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/ml;
R&D Systems) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF,
20 ng/ml; R&D Systems). Differentiated GSCs were
cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum.

Plasmids
For the generation of pSFS-CPEB1 plasmid
containing the full-length coding sequence of
human CPEB1 [54], PCR was performed with
cDNA from human brain cDNA library (Clontech)
with the following oligomers: N-terminal fragment

TTAATTCTGAACC-3′. The amplified PCR products were
subcloned into pGEM-T-easy (Promega) and digested
with XbaI-NotI and then inserted into p8×Myc-Rluc [18,
56]. Construction procedure of p8×Myc-Rluc-xCCNB13'UTR(WT),
p8×Myc-Rluc-xCCNB1-3'UTR(MT),
and pLL3.7-shCPEB1 were described elsewhere. All
oligomers were purchased from Cosmo Genetech (Seoul,
Korea), Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea) or Macrogen (Seoul,
Korea). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing
(Cosmo Genetech, Seoul, Korea).

Affinity purification of SFS-tagged protein mRNP
complexes was performed as previously described [28].
To establish cell lines stably expressing SFS-tagged
CPEB1 (SFS-CPEB1), 293T cells were transfected
with plasmids encoding SFS-CPEB1 and pGK-puro. 48
hr after transfection, the cells were split at a 1:10 ratio
and cultured in medium containing puromycin (SigmaAldrich; 2 µg/ml) for 2 weeks. The individual puromycinresistant colonies were isolated and screened by Western
blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). 10
dishes (100 mm diameter) of confluent 293T cells stably
expressing SFS-CPEB1 were lysed with 3.5 ml TAP
lysis buffer [0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 25 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM
β-glycerophosphate, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Applied Science) without EDTA, 1mM EDTA, and
RNaseOUT (Invitrogen)] on ice for 30 min. The cells were
homogenized in Symplekin immunoprecipitation buffer
[18] and cleared lysate was precipitated with sequential
SBP and S-protein affinity gel (Novagen). Total RNA was
purified from precipitated gel pellet by TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). In all, ~1 ug of total RNA was used for
making cDNA library by GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) and
amplification by 25 cycles of PCR with adapter primers.
The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript II KS (-)
vector (Stratagene) and transformed DH10B competent
cells (Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequences from randomly
chosen colonies were searched against NCBI GenBank,
DAVID Bioinformatics Resources, and SOURCE search
(http://source.stanford.edu). Prediction of functional
CPE and the other additional controlling elements in the
transcript were analyzed by use of the bioinformatics
resource (http://genome.imim.es/CPE) [30].

Sphere formation assay
Cells were plated at a density of 1,000 cells/ plate in
12 well plates and incubated in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2 at 37°C. 14 days later, plates were examined
for sphere formation using an inverted microscope. The
spheres with diameter >100 μm were then counted.

Lentivirus production and transduction
293T in 100-mm plates were transfected with
6.67 μg of HRST-CPEB1-IRES-GFP or pLL3.7shCPEB1 vector, 3.33 μg of VSV-G plasmid DNA, and
5 μg of packaging viral CMV delta 8.9 plasmid using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The medium was
changed 6 hr after transfection. The medium containing
lentivirus was harvested at 48 hr after transfection.
Viral particles were concentrated and purified using a
Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech). Cells were infected with
lentivirus in the presence of 6 μg/ml polybrene.

Semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative RTPCR analysis
Semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTand qRT-PCR) were performed to determine mRNA
levels. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Total RNA (1~2 µg) was used as template
to synthesize cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) or ImProm-II reverse transcription system
(Promega). qRT-PCR analysis was performed on the
LightCycler 480 machine (Roche) using LightCycle
480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche). The PCR

The PCR products were analyzed on the 1% agarose gel.

To allow observation of histologic features, mice
were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by
transcardial perfusion with 10 ml of phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde
solution. The brains were removed, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 hr at 4°C. For immunostaining,
after the antigen retrieval process with citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) and endogenous peroxidase blocking with
3% hydrogen peroxide, tissue sections were incubated
in 1% BSA blocking solution (v/v) for 30 min at room
temperature, then in primary antibody overnight at 4°C
in a humidified chamber. For primary antibodies, we used
goat antibody to GFP (Abcam, 1:500) and mouse antibody
to Nestin (Abcam, 1:1,000). Sections were rinsed three
times with a washing buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% cold fish
skin gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.01 M PBS) and
then incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hr at room
temperature. For secondary antibodies, we used rabbit
antibody conjugated to Alexa 568 to GFP and mouse
antibody conjugated to Cy3 to Nestin. To decrease nonspecific Nestin signals in mouse tissue, we used the Mouse
on Mouse Fluorescein kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections
were mounted on slides and covered with Vectashield
mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories).
For free-floating immunofluorescence, after fixing brain
samples in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, samples were
equilibrated in a cryoprotective solution of 30% sucrose
(w/v) for 24 hr. Coronal 30 µm sections were cut serially
on a microtome with a freezing stage and stored in PBS at
4°C until analysis. Sections were mounted on slides and
covered with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories).

Luciferase assays for various CPEB1 ribonome
sensors
Various sensors were cotransfected with
normalization control pGL3-Control (Promega; firefly
luciferase) into 293T cells by using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) or METAFECTENE PRO (Biontex)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction and previous
direction [57]. After 48 hr, cells were lysed with 1 ×
passive lysis buffer (Promega). Aliquots of lysates
were analyzed by dual luciferase reporter assay system
(Promega). The sensor signal from the Renilla luciferase
was first normalized with that from firefly (pGL3-Control;
Promega). Then the signal was renormalized with that
from the Renilla luciferase that lacked 3'UTR region
(control sensor).

REMBRANDT database analysis
Expression signal values of CPEB1 gene in
non-tumor brain tissues and various brain tumors and
patients’ survival data grouped by CPEB1 expression
levels were obtained from REMBRANDT database
of the National Cancer Institute (https://caintegrator.
nci.nih.gov/rembrandt/). The median values of relative
probe (219578_s_at) signal of each brain tumors were
normalized to that of non-tumor brain tissues.

Xenograft mouse model
All animal research was conducted in accordance
with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the National Cancer Center,
Republic of Korea. Cells were orthotopically transplanted
following washing and re-suspension in PBS (1 × 105
cells per mouse for CSC2 control and CPEB1). Cells were
injected stereotactically into the left striatum of 6-weekold female Balb/c nude mice (n = 10). The injection
coordinates were 2.2 mm to the left of the midline and
0.2 mm posterior to the bregma at a depth of 3.5 mm.
The brain of each mouse was harvested and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde.
