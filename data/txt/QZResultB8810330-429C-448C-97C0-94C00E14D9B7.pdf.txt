Abstract
PIK3CA mutations may predict response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in patients with advanced cancers,
but the relevance of mutation subtype has not been investigated. Patients with diverse cancers referred to the
Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy were analyzed for PIK3CA and, if possible, KRAS mutations. Patients
with PIK3CA mutations were treated, whenever possible, with agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway. Overall, 105 (10%) of 1,012 patients tested harbored PIK3CA mutations. Sixty-six (median 3 prior
therapies) of the 105 PIK3CA-mutant patients, including 16 individuals (of 55 PIK3CA-mutant patients tested)
with simultaneous KRAS mutations, were treated on a protocol that included a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
inhibitor; 17% (11/66) achieved a partial response (PR). Patients with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation compared
with patients who had other PIK3CA mutations or patients with wild-type PIK3CA treated on the same
protocols had a higher PR rate (6/16, 38% vs. 5/50; 10% vs. 23/174, 13%, respectively; all P  0.02). None of the
16 patients with coexisting PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13 attained a PR (0/16, 0%). Patients
treated with combination therapy versus single-agent therapies had a higher PR rate (11/38, 29% vs. 0/28, 0%;
P ¼ 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that H1047R was the only independent factor predicting response
[OR 6.6, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 1.02–43.0, P ¼ 0.047). Our data suggest that interaction between PIK3CA
mutation H1047R versus other aberrations and response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis inhibitors warrants further
exploration. Cancer Res; 73(1); 276–84. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently dysregulated in
human cancers by virtue of a variety of molecular aberrations,
including PIK3CA mutations, which are frequently found in
diverse cancers (1–7). Preclinical models and early clinical data
suggested that PIK3CA mutations may predict sensitivity to
treatment with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in multiple tumor
types (8–14).
Patients with diverse tumors and PIK3CA mutations showed
a response rate of 35% in early-phase clinical trials with PI3K/
AKT/mTOR inhibitors compared with 6% in patients without

PIK3CA mutations (11). It is, however, conceivable that only
subsets of patients with PIK3CA mutations derive beneﬁt from
therapy targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Resistance
might be determined by the presence of simultaneous mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
or by the type of PIK3CA mutation. An analogous situation
exists for EGFR mutations in non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), KIT mutations in gastrointestinal stromal cancers,
and others, where differential sensitivity to targeting compounds is of critical importance (15, 16). In the preclinical
setting, PIK3CA mutation H1047R was a stronger driver of
tumor development than E545K or E542K and showed
sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (17). In addition, immortalized ﬁbroblasts with the H1047R PIK3CA
mutation resulted in greater activation of AKT than
E545K and E542K mutations (18). Finally, preclinical characterization of PWT33597, a dual inhibitor of PI3K and
mTOR, showed a lower IC50 for H1047R (21 nmol/L) than
for E545K (86 nmol/L) or E542K (87 nmol/L; ref. 19). Therefore, we investigated treatment outcomes with respect to the
type of PIK3CA mutation in patients with advanced cancer
who were referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted
Therapy (CCTT) at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center (MD Anderson, Houston, TX).

PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors in Cancers with PIK3CA H1047R Mutation

Materials and Methods
Patients
PIK3CA mutations were investigated in patients with
advanced tumors and available tissue referred to the CCTT
at MD Anderson for clinical trials of targeted therapeutic
agents starting in October 2008. The registration of patients
in the database, pathology assessment, and mutation analysis were conducted at MD Anderson. The study and all
treatments have been conducted according to the principles
expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by
the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board.
Tumor tissue mutation analyses
PIK3CA mutations were investigated in archival formalinﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissue blocks or material from ﬁneneedle aspiration biopsy obtained from diagnostic and/or
therapeutic procedures. All histologies were centrally reviewed
at MD Anderson. Mutation testing was carried out in the
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment–certiﬁed
Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory within the Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at MD Anderson. DNA was
extracted from microdissected parafﬁn-embedded tumor sections and analyzed using a PCR-based DNA sequencing method for PIK3CA mutations in codons 532 to 554 of exon 9 (helical
domain) and codons 1011 to 1062 of exon 20 (kinase domain).
This included the mutation hotspot region of the PIK3CA
proto-oncogene denoted by Sanger sequencing, following
ampliﬁcation of 276 bp and 198 bp amplicons, respectively,
by using primers designed by the MD Anderson Molecular
Diagnostic Laboratory.
Since January 2011, the assay has been changed to mass
spectrometric detection (Sequenom MassARRAY) to screen
for the mutational hotspots in exon 1 (Q60K, R88Q, E110K,
and K111N), exon 4 (N345K), exon 6 (S405S), exon 7 (E418K,
C420R, and E453K), exon 9 [P539R, E542 (bases 1 and 2),
E545 (all 3 bases), and Q546 (bases 1 and 2)], exon 18 (F909L),
and exon 20 [Y1021 (bases 1 and 2), T1025 (base 1), M1043I,
M1043V, A1046V, H1047Y, H1047, and G1049R]. The mutations identiﬁed during the initial screening were conﬁrmed
by Sanger sequencing assay. The lower limit of detection is
approximately 10%. Whenever possible, in addition to
PIK3CA, mutation analysis using PCR-based DNA sequencing was done for KRAS and NRAS codons 12, 13, and 61
mutations of exons 1 to 2 (20). The lower limit of detection
was approximately 20%. In addition, whenever possible,
PTEN expression was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (monoclonal mouse anti-human PTEN antibody clone
6H2.1; Dako), and complete loss of expression was considered as PTEN loss.
Treatment and evaluation
Consecutive patients with underlying PIK3CA mutations
were enrolled, whenever possible, in clinical trials containing
inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Supplementary
Table S1). Treatment continued until disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity occurred. Treatment was carried out
according to the speciﬁc requisites in the treatment protocols
selected.

www.aacrjournals.org

Assessments, including history, physical examination, and
laboratory evaluations, were carried out as speciﬁed in each
protocol, typically before the initiation of therapy, weekly
during the ﬁrst cycle, and then, at a minimum, at the beginning
of each new treatment cycle. Efﬁcacy was assessed from
computed tomography scans and/or magnetic resonance
imaging at baseline before treatment initiation and then
every 2 cycles (6–8 weeks). All radiographs were read in the
Department of Radiology at MD Anderson and reviewed in
the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics
tumor measurement clinic. Responses were categorized
according to RECIST 1.0 criteria (21). In brief, complete
response (CR) was deﬁned as the disappearance of all
measurable and nonmeasurable disease; partial response
(PR) was deﬁned as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of
the longest diameter of measurable target lesions; progressive disease (PD) was deﬁned as at least a 20% increase in the
sum of the longest diameter of measurable target lesions, or
unequivocal progression of a nontarget lesion, or the appearance of a new lesion; and stable disease (SD) was deﬁned as
neither sufﬁcient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufﬁcient
increase to qualify for PD.
Statistical analysis
Two-way contingency tables were used to summarize the
relationship between 2 categorical variables. Fisher exact
test was used to assess the association among categorical
variables and mutation status. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test
was applied to assess the association among continuous
variables and mutation status. Multicovariable logistic
regression was applied to identify the multiple predictors
associated with the response outcome and number of prior
therapies, histology, type of therapy, PIK3CA mutation types,
and KRAS mutations, etc. Progression-free survival (PFS)
was deﬁned as the time interval from the start of therapy to
the ﬁrst observation of disease progression or death, whichever occurred ﬁrst. Patients alive and without disease progression were censored at the last follow-up date. Overall
survival (OS) was deﬁned as the time interval from the
start of therapy to the date of death or the date of last
follow-up, whichever occurred ﬁrst. OS and PFS were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and were
compared among the subgroups of patients using a log-rank
test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were ﬁt to
assess the association between patient characteristics and
PFS or OS. All tests were 2-sided, and P values less than 0.05
were considered statistically signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 17 computer software
(SPSS).

unexpected taking into account the high prevalence of PIK3CA
mutations in malignancies such as breast, endometrial, squamous cervical, and ovarian cancer (Table 1). Mutations in exon
9 of PIK3CA were found in 67 (64%) patients, in exon 20 in 36
(34%) patients, and in other or more than one exons in 2 (2%)
patients. The most frequent mutation was E545K (1633G>A) in

(13%), G12A mutation (35G>C) in 12 (9%) patients, and G12C
(34G>T) in 12 (9%) patients (Table 2).
Patients with PIK3CA mutations had a higher prevalence of
KRAS mutations than patients with wild-type (wt) PIK3CA (31/
86, 36% vs. 106/631, 17%; P < 0.001; Supplementary Table S2).
Interestingly, PIK3CA mutations in exon 9, compared with
others (wt PIK3CA, other PIK3CA mutation), showed a strong
association with KRAS mutations (21/53, 40% vs. 116/664, 17%;
P < 0.001). This trend was not signiﬁcant for exon 20 PIK3CA
mutations (9/31, 29% vs. 128/686, 19%; P ¼ 0.16).
Of the 1,012 patients, 367 were tested for NRAS and 24 (7%)
had mutations. The most prevalent was the Q61R mutation
(182A>G) present in 13 (54%) patients with a NRAS mutation,
Q61K mutation (181C>A) in 6 patients (25%), Q61L mutation
(182A>T) in 3 patients (13%), G12S mutation (34G>A) in 1 (4%)
patient, and G13D (38G>A) in 1 (4%) patient. NRAS mutations
were not associated with PIK3CA mutations.
Furthermore, of the 1,012 patients, 586 were tested for PTEN
expression and 88 (15%) showed complete loss of staining.
PTEN status was not associated with PIK3CA or KRAS mutation status.

Response rate. Of the 105 patients with PIK3CA mutations, 66 (63%) were prospectively enrolled in clinical trials that
included a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor. These patients were
refractory to a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1–12). Of
these 66 patients, 17 (26%) had colorectal cancer, 12 (18%)
breast cancer, 10 (15%) ovarian cancer, 9 (14%) endometrial
cancer, 6 (9%) squamous cell cervical cancer, 4 (6%) squamous cell head and neck cancer, 2 (3%) renal cancer, and 6
(9%) other cancers (adenoid cystic head and neck cancer,
anal squamous cell cancer, appendiceal carcinoma, carcinoma of unknown primary, papillary thyroid cancer, and
small intestine cancer; Fig. 1). Most patients (52/66, 79%)
received mTORC1 inhibitor (rapalog)-based therapy, 9 (14%)
PI3K inhibitor-based therapy, 3 (4%) dual PI3K and mTOR
kinase inhibitor-based therapy, and 2 (3%) AKT inhibitorbased therapy (Supplementary Table S1). Single-agent therapies were given to 28 (42%) patients and 38 (58%) received
combination therapy. Overall, 11 [17%; 95% conﬁdence
interval (CI), 0.10–0.27] patients achieved a PR and an
additional 4 (6%; 95% CI, 0.02–0.15) had SD  6 months
(rate of SD  6 months/PR 23%; 15/66; 95% CI, 0.14–0.34).
Patients with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation compared with
patients having other PIK3CA mutations had a higher PR
rate (6/16, 38% vs. 5/50, 10%; P ¼ 0.018) and a higher rate of
SD of 6 or more months/PR (7/16, 44% vs. 8/50, 16%; P ¼
0.037). Patients with a PIK3CA E545K mutation had an
identical PR rate (3/18, 17% vs. 8/48, 17%; P ¼ 1.00), and
not a signiﬁcantly different rate of SD of 6 or more months/
PR (5/18, 28% vs. 10/48, 21%; P ¼ 0.53) compared with
patients having other PIK3CA mutations. In addition,
patients with a PIK3CA E542K mutation did not have a
signiﬁcantly different PR rate (1/11, 9% vs. 10/55, 18%;
P ¼ 0.67), and not a signiﬁcantly different rate of SD of 6

Finally, we analyzed response in 174 patients with wt PIK3CA
who received the same therapies as patients with a H1047R
PIK3CA mutation and found that patients with a PIK3CA
H1047R mutation compared with patients having wt PIK3CA
had a higher PR rate (6/16, 38% vs. 23/174, 13%; P ¼ 0.02), but
not an SD of 6 or more months/PR rate (7/16, 44% vs. 49/174,
28%; P ¼ 0.25). Characteristics of patients with H1047R
versus other PIK3CA mutations are listed in Table 3.
Of the 66 treated patients with PIK3CA mutations, 55
(83%) had available tissue for KRAS mutation testing. Moreover, of the 16 patients with PIK3CA and simultaneous KRAS
mutations in codon 12 or 13, none had a PR compared with 9
PRs in 39 patients with PIK3CA mutations and wt KRAS or
codon 61 KRAS mutations (0/16, 0% vs. 9/39, 23%; P ¼ 0.046).
Similarly, no patient with PIK3CA and simultaneous KRAS
mutations in codon 12 or 13 had SD of 6 or more months/PR
compared with 13 SD of 6 or more months/PR in patients
with PIK3CA mutations and wt KRAS or a codon 61 KRAS
mutation (0/16, 0% vs. 13/39, 33%; P ¼ 0.011). Interestingly,
patients (n ¼ 2) with PIK3CA mutations and simultaneous
KRAS mutations in codon 61 (Q61H) had either a PR (ovarian
cancer, n ¼ 1) or SD of 6 or more months (colorectal cancer,
n ¼ 1).
Furthermore, of the 66 treated patients with PIK3CA
mutations, 23 (35%) had available tissue for NRAS testing

and only 1 (4%) had the mutation. This patient had PD after
1.6 months.
Of the 66 treated patients with PIK3CA mutations, 32 (48%)
had available tissue for PTEN expression testing and 5 (16%)
had a complete loss of staining. These 5 patients had SD
ranging from 3.7 months to 4.4 months (n ¼ 2) or PD (n ¼ 3).
Among the other factors considered, patients with PIK3CA
mutations treated with combination therapies including a
PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor had a higher PR rate (11/38, 29%
vs. 0/28, 0%; P ¼ 0.002) and a higher rate of SD of 6 or more
months/PR (14/38, 37%, vs. 1/28, 4%; P ¼ 0.002) than patients
treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor monotherapies. In
addition, patients with colorectal cancer and PIK3CA mutations had a trend toward having a lower PR rate (0/17, 0% vs.
11/49, 22%; P ¼ 0.05) and a lower rate of SD of 6 or more
months/PR (1/17, 6% vs. 14/49, 29%; P ¼ 0.09) than patients
with PIK3CA mutations and other histologies. There was a
trend to a higher PR rate (9/38, 24% vs. 2/28, 7%; P ¼ 0.10) and
rate of SD of 6 or more months/PR (12/38, 32% vs. 3/28, 11%;
P ¼ 0.07) in patients with PIK3CA mutations with up to 3 prior
therapies compared with patients who had more than 3 prior
therapies. Patients with PIK3CA mutations with mutation
analysis in primary tumor tissue had similar PR rates (7/39,
18% vs. 4/27, 15%; P ¼ 1.00) and rates of SD of 6 or more
months/PR (10/39, 26% vs. 5/27, 19%; P ¼ 0.56) compared with
patients who had mutation analysis done in tissue from
metastatic sites.

Because most patients (52/66, 79%) received treatment with
rapalogs, we conducted a separate analysis for this group and
found that patients with a H1047R mutation compared with
other PIK3CA mutations had a strong trend to a higher rate of
PR (6/14, 43% vs. 5/38, 13%; P ¼ 0.05) and a higher rate of SD of 6
or more months/PR (7/14, 50% vs. 7/38, 18%; P ¼ 0.026).
Patients treated with rapalogs in combination with other
therapies had a higher PR rate (11/38, 29% vs. 0/28, 0%; P ¼
0.002) and a higher rate of SD of 6 or more months/PR (14/38,
37%, vs. 1/28, 4%; P ¼ 0.002) than patients treated with rapalog
monotherapies.
A multicovariable logistic regression model, which included number of prior therapies (3 vs. >3), histology (colorectal vs. others), PIK3CA mutation type (H1047R vs. others),
and type of therapy (combination vs. monotherapy), showed
that the PIK3CA H1047R mutation was the only independent
factor predicting a PR (OR 6.6; 95% CI, 1.02–43.0; P ¼ 0.047).
A separate multivariate model with 55 patients tested for
KRAS mutations, which included number of prior therapies
(3 vs. >3), histology (colorectal vs. others), KRAS mutation
(codons 12 and 13 vs. others), PIK3CA mutation type
(H1047R vs. others), and type of therapy (combination vs.
monotherapy), showed that the PIK3CA H1047R mutation
was the only factor trending toward statistical signiﬁcance
to predict a PR (OR 9.3; 95% CI, 0.86–100.29; P ¼ 0.067);
however, this analysis was underpowered to give a deﬁnitive
answer.
Progression-free survival. The median PFS for all 66
patients with PIK3CA mutations treated with PI3K/AKT/
mTOR inhibitors was 2 months (95% CI, 1.4–2.6). Patients with
PIK3CA H1047R mutations compared with patients having
other PIK3CA mutations trended toward having a longer
median PFS (5.7 vs. 2 months; P ¼ 0.06; Fig. 2A). Patients with
a PIK3CA E545K mutation did not have a signiﬁcantly different
median PFS compared with patients who had other PIK3CA
mutations (3.1 vs. 1.9 months; P ¼ 0.54; Fig. 2B). Patients with a

www.aacrjournals.org

PIK3CA E542K mutation compared with patients who had
other PIK3CA mutations had a trend toward having a shorter
median PFS (1.8 vs. 2.6 months; P ¼ 0.06; Fig. 2C). Finally, we
analyzed PFS in 174 patients with wt PIK3CA who received the
same therapies as patients with H1047R PIK3CA mutations and
found that patients with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation compared
with patients having wt PIK3CA had a similar median PFS (5.7
vs. 3.5 months; P ¼ 0.34).
Of the 55 patients with PIK3CA mutations tested for KRAS
mutations, patients with codon 12 and 13 mutations had a
shorter median PFS compared with patients who had wt KRAS
or codon 61 mutations (1.8 vs. 2.6 months; P ¼ 0.046; Fig. 2D).
Patients with PIK3CA mutations treated with combination
therapies had a longer median PFS than patients treated with
monotherapies (3.1 vs. 1.8 months; P ¼ 0.004) and patients
with PIK3CA mutations and colorectal cancer had a trend
toward having a shorter median PFS than patients with PIK3CA
mutations and other histologies (1.9 vs. 2.5 months; P ¼ 0.11).
There was no difference in median PFS between patients with
up to 3 prior therapies compared with patients who had more
than 3 prior therapies (1.9 months vs. 2.6 months; P ¼ 0.13).
In a subgroup of patients treated with rapalogs, patients
with a H1047R mutation compared with other PIK3CA mutations had a longer median PFS (8.2 vs. 2 months; P ¼ 0.023).
Patients treated with rapalogs in combination with other
therapies had a longer median PFS (2.2 vs. 1.7 months; P ¼
0.005) than patients treated with rapalog monotherapies.
A multicovariable Cox regression model, which included,
histology (colorectal vs. others), PIK3CA mutation type
(H1047R vs. others and E542K vs. others), and type of therapy
(combination vs. monotherapy), showed prolonged PFS in
patients treated with combination therapies (HR 0.51; 95% CI,
0.27–0.94; P ¼ 0.03). A separate multicovariable Cox regression
model with 55 patients tested for KRAS mutations, which

(H1047R vs. others and E542K vs. others), and type of therapy
(combination vs. monotherapy), showed that none of factors
tested independently predicted prolonged PFS.
Overall survival. The median OS for all patients with
PIK3CA mutations treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors
was 9.6 months (95% CI, 7.1–12.1) and there were no significant differences among PIK3CA mutation subtypes (H1047R,
E545K, E542K) and KRAS mutation subtypes (codon 12 and
13). In addition, there was no difference in a median OS
between combinations versus monotherapies and in patients
with up to 3 prior treatment regimens compared with
patients who had more than 3 prior treatment regimens.
However, patients with colorectal cancer compared with
other histologies had a shorter median OS (5.4 vs. 11.1
months; P ¼ 0.025).
In a subgroup of patients treated with rapalogs, patients
with a H1047R mutation had a similar median OS as patients
with other PIK3CA mutations (7.5 vs. 8.9 months, P ¼ 0.96).
Patients treated with rapalogs in combination with other
therapies had a longer median OS (10.0 vs. 3.6 months; P ¼
0.029) than patients treated with rapalog monotherapies.
A multicovariable Cox regression model, which included
number of prior therapies (3 vs. >3) and histology (colorectal
vs. others), showed a trend to shorter OS in patients with
colorectal cancer (HR 2.01; 95% CI, 0.91–4.74; P ¼ 0.08).

following PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor treatment was 23% (with
17% of all patients attaining a PR). It is known that EGFR
inhibitors preferentially induce response in NSCLC with certain EGFR mutations and, similarly, KIT inhibitors are preferentially active in gastrointestinal stromal tumors only with
speciﬁc KIT mutations (15, 16). It is, therefore, plausible that
certain PIK3CA mutation types predict enhanced sensitivity to
PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. Alternatively, resistance might be
driven by molecular aberrations in other relevant pathways.
Our group and others showed that, in colorectal and other
cancers, PIK3CA mutations often coexist with KRAS mutations,
and preclinical data suggested that having a concurrent KRAS
mutation might account for resistance to PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway inhibitors (8–10, 22–24). In agreement with these
previous reports, we found in this study that cancers with
PIK3CA mutations compared with wt PIK3CA have a higher
prevalence of simultaneous KRAS mutations (36% vs. 17%; P <
0.001). This was mainly due to the prevalence of simultaneous
KRAS mutations in patients with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations
compared with prevalence of KRAS mutations in patients
without PIK3CA exon 9 mutations (40% vs. 17%; P < 0.001. In
contrast, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were not statistically
associated with simultaneous KRAS mutations (29% vs. 19%;
P ¼ 0.16). Similar observations have been reported in patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer (23).
Furthermore, in the current study, we analyzed treatment
outcomes (PR, PFS, and OS) for patients with the most frequent
PIK3CA mutations such as E545K and E542K in exon 9 coding
for the helical domain, and H1047R in exon 20 coding for the

kinase domain, and we found that patients with a PIK3CA
H1047R mutation compared with patients with other PIK3CA
mutations treated on the same protocols had a higher PR rate
(38% vs. 10%; P ¼ 0.018) and a trend toward having a longer
median PFS (5.7 months vs. 2 months; P ¼ 0.06). Similarly,
patients with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation compared with
patients with wt PIK3CA treated on the same protocols had
a higher PR rate (38% vs. 13%; P ¼ 0.02); they did not, however,
have a statistically signiﬁcant longer median PFS (5.7 months
vs. 3.5 months; P ¼ 0.34). In addition, patients with PIK3CA
mutations and simultaneous KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13
compared with patients who had PIK3CA mutations and wt
KRAS or codon 61 KRAS mutations had a signiﬁcantly lower PR
rate (0% vs. 23%; P ¼ 0.046). However, KRAS mutations in codon
12 or 13 were not conﬁrmed as an independent factor for a PR
in multivariate analysis. These observations regarding the
relevance of KRAS aberrations have to be interpreted with
caution because of the low numbers of patients and because
differences in outcomes can be inﬂuenced by other factors
such as type of therapy and histology. Of potential interest,
both patients with PIK3CA and simultaneous KRAS mutations
in codon 61 (Q61H) attained either a PR (ovarian cancer, n ¼ 1)
or SD of 6 or more months (colorectal cancer, n ¼ 1). Patients
with PIK3CA mutations and codon 12 and 13 KRAS mutations
had a shorter median PFS compared with patients who had
PIK3CA mutations and wt KRAS or codon 61 mutations (1.8
months vs. 2.6 months; P ¼ 0.046). Patients with colorectal
cancer and PIK3CA mutations treated with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR
inhibitor had a strong trend toward having a lower PR rate
compared with other cancers with PIK3CA mutations (0% vs.
22%; P ¼ 0.05). This trend might be explained by the frequent
presence of simultaneous KRAS mutations and low prevalence
of H1047R mutations in the patients with colorectal cancer (22,
23). In addition, it is possible that PIK3CA mutations may have
different roles in different histologies. A similar phenomenon
has been reported for BRAF mutations. A BRAF V600E mutation is highly predictive for response to BRAF inhibitors in
melanoma, but not in colorectal cancer (25, 26).
In our study, all PRs in PIK3CA mutant patients were
observed when combination therapies including a PI3K/
AKT/mTOR inhibitor were used (29% vs. 0%, P ¼ 0.002;
combination therapy including a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor
vs. single-agent PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor). However, combinations were used as frequently in the wt PIK3CA group,
and the response rate was signiﬁcantly lower, suggesting
that it is not the use of combinations in and of itself that
mediates response. The need for combination therapy, rather than treatment with single-agent PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors, was not unexpected as patients with advanced cancer, including those with PIK3CA mutations, are likely to
have other driver aberrations as well (9, 10, 27–30). Furthermore, preclinical models showed that breast cancer cell lines
with PIK3CA mutations develop an apoptotic response to the
single-agent BEZ235 PI3K inhibitor only in the presence of
BIM expression, whereas paclitaxel was similarly effective
irrespective of BIM expression (31). In addition, PIK3CA
mutations can increase the expression of other factors such
as heregulin, which lead to oncogenic pathway activation,

www.aacrjournals.org

independent of PI3K (29). Last but not least, single-agent
mTOR inhibition with rapalogs or even with mTOR kinase
inhibitors can lead to feedback activation of AKT signaling
(27, 28).
There are several limitations to our data (32). First, this study
was retrospective and not randomized, and our ﬁndings need
to be conﬁrmed in a more controlled fashion. Second, the
number of patients treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors
was relatively small. Third, the treatments used and the patient
population were heterogeneous, although this might also
imply that the relevance of H1047R is not limited to any one
drug or histology. It remains plausible, however, that among
distinct histologies, PIK3CA mutations may or may not function in precisely the same role (principal driver mutation vs.
passenger mutation). Further studies are needed to explore the
relationship between different agents and sensitivity based on
speciﬁc mutations. Finally, improved response rates did not
translate to improved survival, although the relatively small
number of patients might preclude deﬁnitive conclusions.
In summary, we have shown that heavily pretreated patients
with advanced cancers who harbor a PIK3CA H1047R mutation
may be more sensitive to therapeutic targeting with PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors. In multicovariable analysis,
having a PIK3CA H1047R mutation was the only independent
factor predicting a response. Therefore, the role of PIK3CA
H1047R mutations warrants further investigation in the setting
of prospective controlled trials with the application of targeted
PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in the clinic.
