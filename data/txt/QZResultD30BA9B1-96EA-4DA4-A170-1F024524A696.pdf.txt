BACKGROUND. The ISEL (Iressa Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer) clinical trial
evaluated the efficacy of gefitinib versus placebo in pretreated nonsmall-cell lung
cancer patients. Two different antibodies, scoring systems, and cutoff points of
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression were compared to
predict response and survival of enrolled patients.

METHODS. EGFR expression was assessed in tumor samples by immunohisto-

RESULTS. Data for EGFR expression were available for 379 patients for Dako and
357 patients for Zymed antibody (22% and 21%, respectively, of trial population).

CONCLUSIONS. Assessment with the Dako PharmDx kit and percentage of cells
with positive staining may provide more accurate prediction of differential effect

EGFR Protein and Gefitinib in NSCLC/Hirsch et al.

E

pidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR TKIs, gefitinib and erlotinib) are
active in a subset of nonsmall-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients. The response rates and disease
control rates reported in clinical trials of EGFR TKIs
in advanced pretreated NSCLC patients in Western
populations are 10% to 20% and 40%, respectively,1–3
indicating that a proportion of NSCLC patients do
not derive any benefit from EGFR TKIs. A major
research effort over the last decade focused on the
identification of predictive biomarkers for response
and survival benefit to EGFR TKIs, and many of these
studies analyzed EGFR protein expression by immunohistochemistry as the most applicable method to
assess the presence of molecular target in the tumor.
Results of the ISEL (Iressa Survival Evaluation in
Lung cancer) phase 3 clinical trial in advanced
NSCLC patients who were refractory to or intolerant
of their latest chemotherapy regimen showed some
improvement in survival with gefitinib (plus best
supportive care), which failed to reach statistical significance compared with placebo (plus best supportive care), in the overall population and in patients
with adenocarcinoma.4 Preplanned subgroup analysis of the ISEL demonstrated a statistically significant
increase in survival with gefitinib in patients of Asian
ethnicity and in patients who had never smoked.
A biomarker analysis of this study demonstrated a
nonsignificant 23% reduction in the risk of death for
gefitinib-treated patients who expressed EGFR protein
as assessed by the EGFR Dako PharmDx kit with a
cutoff point of 10% of cells exhibiting the staining of
at least slight intensity.5 No benefit was observed in
the subset of patients who were classified as EGFR
protein-negative. The National Cancer Institute of
Canada BR.21 clinical trial that demonstrated a significant improvement in survival of erlotinib versus placebo-treated advanced NSCLC patients who failed at
least 1 chemotherapy regimen6 showed a 32% reduction in the risk of death for patients with EGFR protein-positive tumor samples.7 No survival advantage
was seen among patients with EGFR protein-negative
tumor samples. This study also used a cutoff point of
10% stained cells and the Dako PharmDx kit. In a
retrospective evaluation of gefitinib-treated NSCLC
patients, Cappuzzo et al.8 used Zymed anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody and a staining index that takes
into account the percent of positive cells and staining
intensity, scored from 0 to 4. Using a cutpoint of 200
on the scale from 0 to 400, superior survival was
demonstrated in EGFR protein-positive versus negative patients (P 5 .01). However, other studies performed on tumor samples from phase 3 clinical trials
investigating the combination of gefitinib or erlotinib

1115

with chemotherapy failed to show any predictive
value of EGFR protein expression for either clinical
response or survival.9,10 Also, there was no association
with EGFR protein expression and survival for NSCLC
patients who received gefitinib monotherapy in the
phase 2 clinical studies IDEAL1 and 2 (Iressa Dose
Evaluation in Advanced Lung cancer).11
Clinical trials of cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against the EGFR in both lung and colorectal cancer required EGFR protein expression in
tumor samples for study entry in most trials. EGFR
protein expression was evaluated by the EGFR
PharmDx kit with cutoff points of at least 11 (at
least 1% or at least 10% of cells with weak staining
according to individual study). More than 90% of
screened patients were scored as EGFR protein-positive in phase 2 clinical studies with cetuximab in
lung cancer12–14 and >75% in phase 2 or 3 colorectal
cancer trials.15,16 Because these trials were performed
largely in EGFR protein-positive patients, the efficacy
of cetuximab in EGFR-negative patients remains
unknown, although 1 report suggests that EGFR protein-negative colorectal cancer patients may respond
to cetuximab.17 In a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial
comparing cetuximab versus cetuximab and irinotecan in metastatic colorectal cancer that was refractory to treatment with irinotecan, the degree of
EGFR staining did not associate with response rates
in either study groups.15
The presence of mutations in the EGFR gene
has also been investigated in tumor samples and is
linked with increased responsiveness to EGFR TKIs
in numerous NSCLC studies.5,18–20 An additional
approach of measuring the EGFR gene copy number
in tumor samples has also demonstrated a survival
advantage for patients with a high copy number in
prospective placebo-controlled clinical trials.5,7,21
These 2 gene-based biomarkers appear to outperform EGFR protein evaluation in predicting the benefit from EGFR TKIs, but, particularly for EGFR
mutations, prospective placebo-controlled clinical
studies are lacking. In contrast to the above evaluations of EGFR gene mutations and copy number,
EGFR immunohistochemistry is a widely applicable
and inexpensive test to conduct. HER-2 protein
expression evaluation by immunohistochemistry, in
conjunction with HER-2 FISH assay, is used for the
selection of breast cancer patients most likely to benefit from trastuzumab therapy,22 and HER-2 gene
copy number has been closely associated with HER-2
protein expression.23
This biomarker study of the placebo-controlled
ISEL trial has provided us the opportunity to compare 2 antibodies (Dako and Zymed), which have

previously been associated with clinical outcome for
NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib, and evaluate
whether different cutoff levels of protein expression
could improve the prediction of response and survival benefit from gefitinib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Study Design
The results of the ISEL study were previously published.4 This was a randomized, double-blind, phase
3 clinical trial comparing the efficacy of gefitinib 250
mg/day (plus best supportive care) versus placebo
(plus best supportive care) in 1692 patients with
advanced NSCLC who were refractory to or intolerant of their latest chemotherapy regimen. The associations between selected biomarkers (EGFR protein
expression, EGFR gene copy number, EGFR, K-ras
and B-raf gene mutations) and treatment outcome in
the ISEL were also reported.5 Of the 379 patients
who were evaluable for EGFR protein expression by
the Dako PharmDx kit in this biomarker analysis,
177 patients were also evaluable for EGFR gene copy
number and EGFR mutation, and some overlap was
seen between those patients who were positive for
these biomarkers.5
EGFR Protein Expression
EGFR protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the Dako EGFR PharmDx kit
(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and Zymed mouse antihuman EGFR monoclonal antibody clone 31G7
(Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, Calif). The
staining procedures were performed according to the
antibody manufacturer’s recommendations as previously reported.8,24 For scoring of samples stained
with the Dako antibody, the percentage of tumor
cells showing membranous staining was recorded,
and a predefined cutoff point of 10% cells with at
least weak staining intensity was applied to define
protein positivity. Scoring was performed by a
trained individual (D.V.P.) who was blinded to the
clinical outcome data. For scoring of samples stained
with the Zymed antibody, a staining index calculated
as percent of stained tumor cells 3 average staining
intensity graded from 0 to 4 was used, resulting in
an index value between 0 and 400. Consistent with
our previous reports,8,24 samples with a staining
index of 200 or higher were predefined as EGFR protein-positive. The scoring was performed by 2
pathologists (F.R.H., W.A.F.) who were blinded to the
clinical outcome data. Consensus scoring was performed for all specimens with staining index differ-

ence of 50 or more. Otherwise, the mean of the 2
readings was reported.

Statistical Analyses
Summary tables and scatterplots were obtained to
explore the relation between percentage of tumor
cells stained with the Dako antibody and the staining
index with the Zymed antibody.
An evaluation of different cutoff points of EGFR
expression with Dako to predict overall survival was
performed using a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model. Separate models were fitted for the different cutoff points used to define EGFR proteinpositive. The fitted models allowed for the effect of
treatment and included terms for histology, sex,
smoking history, reason for prior chemotherapy failure, number of prior chemotherapy regimens, and
performance status. From the fitted models a hazard
ratio and 95% confidence interval, for gefitinib versus
placebo were calculated for patients with EGFR-positive and -negative tumor samples for each of the
different cutoff points analyzed. A treatment by EGFR
expression interaction was assessed to determine
whether the treatment effect is consistent across the
EGFR protein-positive and -negative tumor samples as
defined by different cutoff points. This therefore
reflects the degree of discrimination between positive
and negative tumor samples for each cutoff point. As
the analysis performed was exploratory in nature no
adjustments for multiple testing were made.
The number of patients, deaths, response rate,
and disease control rate for gefitinib and placebo
were also calculated for EGFR-positive and -negative
tumor samples, as defined by different cutoff points.
The evaluation of different cutoff points of EGFR
expression with Dako was repeated to evaluate different cutoff points of EGFR expression with Zymed
antibody scoring index.
A correlation coefficient between the staining
index with the Zymed antibody as assessed by 2
pathologists (F.R.H., W.A.F.) was calculated. In order
to estimate the inter- and intrareader components of
variability a random effects model was fitted to the
data with reader effects taken as random and subject
effects as fixed.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
EGFR protein expression was assessed by the Dako
PharmDx kit in 379 patients (22.4% of all study
subjects) and using Zymed clone 31G7 antibody in
357 patients (21.0% of all study subjects). Data for
both antibodies were available for 296 patients

(17.5%). Demographic and baseline characteristics
of patients evaluable for expression of EGFR with
the Dako or Zymed antibody compared with overall
study population are presented in Table 1. The subset of patients analyzed for protein expression was
comparable to overall study population with the
exception of never-smokers and patients of Asian origin, who are underrepresented in our analysis.

Comparison of Antibodies for Protein
Expression Evaluation
A correlation coefficient between the staining index
with the Zymed antibody as assessed by 2 investigators was calculated as 0.96 (P < .001).
The resulting components of variation for the
interreader and intrareader (interpatient) variation in
determining the staining index with the Zymed antibody were 5.4 and 876.7 respectively. The intrareader
variability component is very small compared with

the variability between patients, indicating good consistency between readers.
Using predefined criteria for protein positivity
(10% of cells with any positive staining for Dako
and staining index 200 for Zymed antibody), 70%
(264 of 379) of tumor samples were scored as positive with Dako and 68% (244 of 357) were scored as
positive with Zymed antibody. For the samples with
available data for both antibodies the agreement
between assessments was 76% (Table 2). The proportion of tumor samples showing no staining of any
intensity with the Dako antibody was 26% as compared with 4% for the Zymed antibody. The relation
between both indices appears to be cubic, and the
majority of the best fit cubic line is in the region
where both scores are positive or both are negative
(data not shown).

Assessment With Dako PharmDx Kit, Zymed Antibody,
and Clinical Outcome With Gefitinib
Objective response rates to gefitinib according to various cutoff points of EGFR immunostaining with
Dako and Zymed antibody are shown in Tables 3 and
4. For the Dako antibody the objective response rates
for EGFR protein-positive/negative patients treated
with gefitinib were 8.0%/1.6% with a cutoff point of
1% of positive cells and 10.0%/5.3% with a cutoff
point 90% positive cells, respectively. For the
Zymed antibody the objective response rates with
gefitinib were 9.9%/3.0% with the cutoff staining

the Zymed antibody, although the differences
between survival HRs appeared smaller and were
nonsignificant in the interaction test for any cutoff
point analyzed.

index 50 and 12.8%/6.3% with the cutoff staining
index 350, respectively. Disease control rates were
similar for patients with EGFR-positive tumors across
all cutoff points analyzed for both antibodies. The
survival hazard ratios (HRs) for gefitinib versus placebo according to the cutoff points are presented in
Tables 3 and 4 and Figures 1 and 2. For the Dako
PharmDx kit, and percent of positive staining, the
largest differences between EGFR protein-positive
and -negative HRs for survival were with low cutoff
levels, indicating better discrimination between positive and negative subgroups at low cutoff levels. The
originally predefined cutoff point 10% was the only
cutoff with a P-value of less than 5% (P 5 .049) in

In this study we compared immunohistochemical
assessments of EGFR protein expression with 2 different procedures, the Dako PharmDx kit and the
Zymed clone 31G7 antibody, which are most frequently used in evaluation of NSCLC patients treated
with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We also
assessed the predictive significance of using different
cutoff points to define EGFR positivity for outcome
of gefitinib therapy and we found that lower cutoff
points are better predictors of survival outcomes
than higher cutoff points for both antibodies studied.
To our knowledge, a comparison of EGFR immunostaining with Dako and Zymed antibodies in
NSCLC tumor samples has not previously been published. Both antibodies are being used in ongoing
and planned studies of EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC.
The setting of the ISEL placebo-controlled randomized phase 3 clinical study enabled us to compare
the procedures of EGFR assessment (with different
antibodies but also different staining protocols and
scoring criteria). Thus, this comparison reflects not
only the properties of individual antibodies but also
the predictive power of the procedures to distinguish
the subsets of patients with different outcomes after
gefitinib therapy.
According to previously established criteria of
EGFR positivity for the Dako and Zymed antibodies,7,24 the proportions of patients with results for
both antibodies that scored as positive is almost
identical (69% and 72%, respectively). The agreement
in identifying negative and positive samples is 76%,
indicating that these 2 procedures identify slightly
different subsets of patients. The number of patients
with no staining of any intensity was higher with the
Dako PharmDx kit as compared with Zymed (26% vs
4%), indicating that staining with Zymed is more
sensitive compared with the Dako PharmDx kit. Similar results were reported by Penault-Llorca et al.25 in
colorectal cancer specimens. The authors compared
the FDA-approved Dako PharmDx kit, Zymed EGFR
kit with clone 31G7 antibody, Ventana EGFR 3C6
antibody, and concluded that the Dako antibody is
less sensitive than other antibodies for all cutoff
points analyzed. In another study in normal colon,
adenoma, and colon carcinoma samples, similar sensitivity of the EGFR PharmDx Kit and Zymed Clone

31G7 antibody was found according to manual and
automatic scoring systems.26
The range of gefitinib response rates in patients
with EGFR-positive were similar for both the Zymed
and Dako antibodies (10%–13% and 8%–12% gefitinib responders with any cutoff level, respectively;
Tables 3 and 4). Disease control rates appeared to be
similar for patients with EGFR-positive across all cutoff levels analyzed for both antibodies. The Zymed
antibody had a higher sensitivity to detect samples
with any staining. The Dako antibody appeared to
better predict the differential survival outcome with
gefitinib, as indicated by a greater difference between
EGFR protein-positive and -negative HRs. Although
these HRs are overlapping over 1.00 for any cutoff
point analyzed, it seems unlikely that patients that
are EGFR-negative, defined as staining <10%, benefit
from gefitinib. It should be stressed that our study
did not directly compare the antibodies, for which
the same methodology of staining procedure and the
same scoring system should have been performed.
We sought to compare different antibodies together
with the staining procedures and scoring systems
originally reported in large clinical studies.5–7 Applying the standard Dako cutoff of 10% to both antibodies gives 72% EGFR-positive for Dako but 94%
EGFR-positive for Zymed. Applying the standard
Zymed 200 cutoff to both antibodies gives 69%
EGFR-positive for Zymed but 15% EGFR-positive for
Dako. Therefore, the scoring systems appear unique
to the antibody.
Similar observation of better prediction of survival benefit from erlotinib with lower cutoff points
to define positive EGFR immunostaining was published by Clark et al.27 In their study, based on the
results of the BR.21 trial and EGFR immunohistochemical staining of tumor samples with the Dako
PharmDx kit, the largest differences between EGFR
protein-positive and -negative HRs for survival were
observed with low cutoff points of percent of positive
cells, staining intensity, and staining index. These
data are in agreement with the present study and do
not support the selection of patients to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors based on the higher cutoff
points to define EGFR positivity.
Lack of association between the degree of EGFR
protein expression and the effectiveness of EGFR
inhibitors was demonstrated in colorectal cancer studies.15,16 Based on a specific ligand binding assay
(Scatchard analysis), the presence of low- and highaffinity EGFRs was identified in tumor samples from
colorectal cancer patients.28 In this study, high-affinity receptors represented a smaller fraction of the
total receptor pool on tumor cells in most samples.

Another report suggested that a subclass of high-affinity receptors is primarily activated after EGFR
binding and is responsible for signal transduction
downstream of EGFR.29 The distinction between lowand high-affinity receptors is not possible by immunohistochemistry with most anti-EGFR antibodies,
including both the Dako and Zymed antibodies,
which were generated from mice immunized with
the purified EGFR antigen from the A-431 cell line
containing both low- and high-affinity EGFRs.28–30
Thus, it is possible that the results of immunohistochemical staining may not adequately reveal the
pool of biologically active EGFRs.
The type of biopsy (eg, lung biopsy vs resection
specimen) may influence the results of EGFR protein
expression analysis, as demonstrated recently by Taillade et al.31 In this study the authors used anti-EGFR
3C6 primary antibody from Ventana Medical Systems
(Illkirch, France) and scoring based on percentage of
positive staining. The concordance between EGFR
protein expression in lung biopsies versus surgical
specimens was poor (correlation coefficient r 5 0.24,
P 5 .17, n 5 41).
In summary, we have demonstrated that EGFR
immunostaining with the Dako PharmDx kit according to percent of cells with positive staining appears
to better predict for survival outcome with gefitinib
than Zymed antibody according to staining index.
Further analysis using similar methods to our study
with samples from other large randomized phase 3
studies would be useful to provide additional evidence of whether 1 immunohistochemical antibody/methodology is superior. If EGFR immunohistochemistry is to be applied for patient selection,
low cutoff levels to define protein positivity should
be used.
