Mapping the Pathways of Resistance to
Targeted Therapies
Kris C. Wood

Abstract
Resistance substantially limits the depth and duration of clinical responses to targeted anticancer therapies. Through the use of
complementary experimental approaches, investigators have
revealed that cancer cells can achieve resistance through adaptation or selection driven by speciﬁc genetic, epigenetic, or microenvironmental alterations. Ultimately, these diverse alterations
often lead to the activation of signaling pathways that, when coopted, enable cancer cells to survive drug treatments. Recently
developed methods enable the direct and scalable identiﬁcation

of the signaling pathways capable of driving resistance in speciﬁc
contexts. Using these methods, novel pathways of resistance to
clinically approved drugs have been identiﬁed and validated. By
combining systematic resistance pathway mapping methods
with studies revealing biomarkers of speciﬁc resistance pathways
and pharmacologic approaches to block these pathways, it may
be possible to rationally construct drug combinations that
yield more penetrant and lasting responses in patients. Cancer Res;

Therapies

events can drive resistance by modifying the target of a drug or
the signaling network or cell state on which a drug acts (1).
Target-centric approaches, most commonly using sequencing
or mutagenesis, have identiﬁed mutations, ampliﬁcations, and
alternative splicing events in the genes encoding the targets of
kinase inhibitors. Included in this group are alternative splicing
events in BRAF, which drive acquired resistance in a substantial
fraction of patients treated with RAF inhibitors (3), as well as the
"gatekeeper" mutations in BCR-ABL (e.g., T315I) and EGFR (e.g.,
T790M), both of which are the targets of third-generation inhibitors with increased potency in these contexts (4–6).
Hypothesis-driven approaches, including those that leverage
our understanding of the key architectural features of oncogenic
signaling networks in cancer cells, have also been a valuable
source of insight into the mechanisms of drug resistance. These
approaches typically make use of cell lines in which resistance has
been evolved through step-wise selection in the presence of drug
treatment, although drug-sensitive cell lines, cell lines with varying levels of intrinsic resistance, and primary cells derived from
human or mouse tumors have also been used in these studies.
Hypothesis-driven studies have revealed important resistance
alterations based, for example, on drug target bypass, signaling
pathway feedback, compensatory survival signaling, and reversible changes in cellular differentiation state (7–12).
More recently, large, unbiased efforts have sought to reveal
genomic or epigenomic alterations associated with resistance.
For example, drug screens across large panels of genomically
annotated cell lines have identiﬁed cell lines harboring "sensitizing" mutations (for example, BRAF in melanoma) that
nevertheless exhibit variable levels of sensitivity to the cognate
kinase inhibitor (13). Analyses of secondary mutations, expression patterns, and other features of these cell line panels suggest
potential mechanisms underlying variations in drug sensitivity
(i.e., intrinsic resistance; refs. 14, 15). Separately, next-generation sequencing of matched pretreatment and postrelapse
patient tumors has identiﬁed, in a fully unbiased fashion,
alterations associated with resistance that can be credentialed
in subsequent validation assays (2, 16).

Intrinsic and acquired resistance place substantial limits on
the clinical effectiveness of targeted therapies (1). Intrinsic resistance can be visualized through "waterfall" plots, which show the
maximum percentage change in the size of target lesions in a
cohort of individual patients following initial drug treatment. In a
typical example, a fraction of patients will fail to respond by
standard criteria (e.g., RECIST), whereas another fraction of
patients will respond but in an incomplete fashion. For the case
of targeted therapies considered to yield high rates of initial
response, like the RAF and MEK inhibitors used in patients with
BRAF mutant melanoma, the percentage of patients that fail to
meet RECIST criteria is often less than 30%, although the majority
of those who meet these criteria nevertheless fail to achieve
complete responses (2). Further, even in patients who respond
initially to targeted therapies, the development of acquired resistance is nearly universal. Collectively these resistance phenomena
yield a scenario in which patients treated with most currently
approved targeted therapies derive progression-free and overall
survival beneﬁts on the scale of weeks to months, but rarely longer
(1, 2).
Determining the key alterations driving resistance to targeted
therapies is likely to be the ﬁrst step toward improving their
potencies and durabilities. A suite a complementary experimental
approaches have been developed to address this problem. These
methods, summarized below, have revealed that a wide range of

Finally, large, unbiased functional screening efforts have led
to the identiﬁcation of novel resistance alterations. For example, genome-scale gain-of-function screens using libraries of
lentivirally delivered open reading frames (ORF) or short guide
RNAs (to direct CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activation),
and analogous loss-of-function screens using genome-scale
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or sgRNAs (to direct CRISPR/
Cas9-based gene knockouts), have identiﬁed genes whose overexpression or inhibition can drive resistance (17–20). Creative
screening approaches utilizing growth factors or combinatorial
cell culture techniques have also identiﬁed potential microenvironmental mediators of drug resistance, which have subsequently been validated in cells and patient-derived samples
(21, 22). Finally, large-scale drug screens have uncovered novel
mechanisms of resistance using pharmacologic probes that
reverse resistance (23, 24). In one particularly exciting example,
biopsy samples were obtained from patients with EGFR or ALK
mutation–positive lung adenocarcinomas who developed resistance to EGFR or ALK inhibitors, respectively. These samples
were converted to cell lines, then subjected to drug screens to
identify drugs that resensitize patient-derived tumor cells in
vitro and in vivo. By matching sensitizing drug combinations
with sequencing, speciﬁc resistance alterations could be functionally credentialed in individual tumors (24). Given recent
advances in conditional reprogramming (25) and organoid
culture (26) methods, which enable the stable propagation of
primary cells from tumor biopsies, it is anticipated that methods like this will become increasingly common in the study of
drug resistance.

Systematic Identiﬁcation of the Signaling
Pathways Controlling Resistance
Although the results above clearly indicate that we possess the
tools necessary to identify the prominent adaptive, genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental alterations that drive resistance to
targeted therapies, they also raise concerns. Cataloguing the constellation of alterations that can drive resistance to even a single
drug in a single disease context is an enormous undertaking, as
evidenced by the dozens of published papers reporting such events.
Perhaps more importantly, if resistance can be independently
driven by so many different alterations, how can it be controlled?
A potential solution to these challenges comes from the observation that diverse alterations appear to drive resistance by coopting a smaller, concerted set of oncogenic pathways (Table 1).
For example, in BRAF mutant melanomas treated with RAF
inhibitors, mutations in NRAS, MEK, and ERK, ampliﬁcation and
alternative splicing of BRAF, and alternative regulation of MAP-3kinases like COT and C-RAF each have the potential to independently drive resistance by reactivating the Ras–MAPK pathway.
Similarly, mutations or altered expression of IGF-1R, PIK3CA,
PTEN, and AKT may also be individually sufﬁcient to drive
resistance to these drugs, but in all cases they appear to do so
through their activation of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3kinase) pathway (2). Consistent with this idea, a broad survey
of the literature suggests that resistance to targeted therapies is
typically associated with the activation of one or more of the
canonical pathways controlling growth, survival, differentiation,
and apoptosis in cancer cells.

On the basis of these observations, we reasoned that a systematic effort to identify the pathways having potential to confer
functional resistance to targeted therapies may accelerate progress
in the ﬁeld. We constructed an initial list of 17 signaling pathways
that have been frequently implicated in the oncogenic processes
above, and for each pathway, a set of 1 to 3 mutant complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were identiﬁed representing core nodes in
each pathway whose overexpression should render the pathway
constitutively active (or, in a minority of cases, inactive). Pathwaymodulating cDNAs were assembled, barcoded, and cloned into a
PGK promoter-driven lentiviral expression vector, then validated
through sequencing and functional assays to ensure proper
engagement of targeted pathways (Fig. 1A; ref. 27).
To identify pathways whose modulation is sufﬁcient to drive
therapeutic resistance in vitro, we used a positive selection pooled
screening protocol with sequencing-based deconvolution. In
BRAFV600E melanoma cells, this method identiﬁed ﬁve major
pathways capable of driving resistance to an MEK1/2 inhibitor
(AZD6244), including the well-documented Ras-MAPK, PI3K,
and NF-kB pathways along with the previously unreported
Notch1 and the estrogen receptor (ERa) pathways (Fig. 1B). On
the strength of these ﬁndings, a large number of screening assays
have been performed to identify potential pathways of resistance
to a range of targeted therapies. Globally, these results suggest that
certain pathways, including Ras–MAPK, PI3K, and Notch1, are
frequently capable of driving resistance in many contexts, whereas
other pathways appear to confer resistance in a context-speciﬁc
fashion. Further, for a given drug, the number of screened pathways capable of conferring resistance by this assay is modest,
typically 5 or fewer (27).
Using these methods, a series of novel pathways of resistance
have been nominated and then subsequently conﬁrmed in
resistant cell lines, tumor models, and/or patient samples. For
example, Ras-driven AKT activation may contribute to the
ubiquitous intrinsic resistance observed in patients with
JAK2-mutant myeloﬁbrosis treated with JAK inhibitors, and
combination therapies involving JAK inhibitors paired with
either AKT or downstream BCL-XL inhibitors reverse resistance
in multiple models (28). In a second example, intrinsic resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanoma is
controlled by combinations of the PI3K, Notch1, and ERa
pathways, and coinhibition of these pathways uniformly sensitizes a panel intrinsically resistant cell lines to these drugs
(27). As a third example, Notch1 activation can drive acquired
resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors in numerous evolved cellular
models of BRAF-mutant melanoma, and Notch1 activation is
observed in the subset of human patients with acquired resistance whose tumors lack evidence of resistance driven by the
established Ras–MAPK and PI3K pathways (27). As a ﬁnal
example, Notch1 activation also identiﬁes a subset of patients
with ERþ breast cancer who fail to derive beneﬁt from treatment
with the selective ER modulator tamoxifen, and acquired resistance to tamoxifen can be reversed in vivo using a g-sectretase
inhibitor that blocks Notch1 signaling (27).

Outlook
Pathway-centric gain-of-function screening adds to the repertoire of methods by which mechanisms of resistance can be
identiﬁed and may help to streamline our ability to connect
diverse resistance-conferring alterations to the underlying path-

4250 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

ways through which they act. Importantly, as with other methods, putative resistance pathways identiﬁed using pathwaycentric screening must be conﬁrmed through the demonstration that pathway inhibition can reverse resistance in independent cell lines or tumors before they can be conﬁrmed as bona
ﬁde resistance pathways (27, 28). Pathway-centric screening
may have particular advantages, owing to its use of validated
reagents, which speciﬁcally activate or inhibit their cognate
pathways, thus potentially minimizing false positives and false
negatives in screening assays, and its use of small libraries of
lentiviral cDNAs, which enable a single researcher to perform
many screening assays across cell lines and drug treatments in
parallel (27).
A potential limitation of this approach is its ability to sample
only a restricted set of signaling pathways. To address this
limitation, it will be important to expand the library of cDNA
constructs to include those encoding common oncogenic mutations and activators or inhibitors of additional pathways (for
example, metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic) as well as
additional nodes within each pathway. Toward this goal, we
have initiated a 2-year project with the National Cancer Institute's Ras Program that will expand the cDNA library by severalfold, and all sequence-validated reagents from this effort will be
made publicly available at low cost. These reagents may also be
complemented by the use of libraries of mutant alleles developed by other groups (29, 30). Finally, although our applications of pathway-centric screening have thus far been limited
primarily to drug resistance, it is straightforward to envision
additional applications. For example, two groups recently
reported elegant chemogenomic mapping efforts involving
mutant cDNA libraries (29, 30), and assays used to study drug
dependencies, in vivo tumorigenesis, and various cancer hallmark properties can potentially be married with pathwaycentric screening.
In the coming years, the key pathways of resistance to a range
of targeted therapies used in distinct contexts are likely to be
deﬁned. At that point, however, major scientiﬁc challenges will
remain. For example, it will likely be necessary to monitor
minimal disease states with high resolution, identify the speciﬁc resistance pathways activated in patients' tumors using
credentialed biomarkers, deﬁne safe and effective strategies to
block resistance pathways in vivo, and then construct methods
to anticipate and pharmacologically adapt to tumor evolution
over time.
