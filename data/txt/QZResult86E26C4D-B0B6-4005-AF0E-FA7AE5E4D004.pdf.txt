BACKGROUND: Among the well described cytogenetic abnormalities in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 19 (t[1;19] [q23;p13]) occurs in a small subset but
has been associated variously with an intermediate prognosis or a bad prognosis in different studies.
METHODS: Adults with ALL and t(1;19) who were treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center were reviewed. Their clinical features and outcomes were compared with those of patients who had
other cytogenetic abnormalities. The study endpoints included the complete remission (CR) rate, the complete response duration (CRD), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of 411 adults with pre-B-cell ALL, 12
patients had t(1;19). Ten of 12 patients with t(1;19) received hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine
(hyper-CVAD) chemotherapy; and the other 2 patients received combined vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD). All 12 patients achieved CR, and the 3-year survival rate was 73%. Patients with t(1;19) had
significantly better CRD and OS compared with all other patients combined and compared individually with
patients who had Philadelphia chromosome-positive, t(4;11), and lymphoma-like abnormalities (deletion 6q,
addition q14q, t[11;14], and t[14;18]). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with ALL and t(1;19) had an excellent prognosis

Chromosomal abnormalities in acute leukemia
determine the disease pathophysiology and patient prognosis. Treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) results in high cure rates of 70% to 90%.
Adults with ALL achieve high complete remission rates
of 80% to 90%; however, cure rates are only 30% to
40%.1
A major difference between childhood and adult
ALL is the frequency of various cytogenetic subcategories.
A hyperdiploid karyotype, which is favorable, is observed
in 30% of children compared with 2% to 5% of adults.
Another favorable category is a translocation involving
chromosomes 12 and 21, t(12;21), which results in the
TEL-AML1 fusion gene.2 The latter is the most common
molecular lesion in childhood ALL but is uncommon in
adult ALL (range, 3%-4%).3,4 The t(9;22), or the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) (an unfavorable cytogenetic
subset), is common in adult ALL (25%) but is rare in
childhood ALL (<5%).5,6
One difficulty with elucidating the prognostic influence of certain cytogenetic abnormalities in ALL has been
the rarity of the disease7 coupled with the low frequency
of specific abnormalities. One recurring translocation in
both children and adults is t(1;19)(q23;p13). It results in
a fusion of the transcription factor 3 gene TCF3 (E2A) at
19p13 with the pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox gene
PBX1 at 1q23, creating a TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene that
encodes a protein with transforming properties. The E2A
gene encodes 2 transcription factors, E12 and E47, which,
in turn, bind to enhancer elements in the immunoglobulin j or IGK gene and regulatory elements of other genes.
PBX1 is a homeobox gene (HOX) on chromosome 1.
E2A/PBX1 fusion messenger RNAs are formed and code
for chimeric proteins that consist of the transcriptional
activating domain of E12/E47 and DNA-binding
domains of PBX1.8,9 The E2a/Pbx1 fusion protein may
promote leukemogenesis by the transactivation of several
genes normally not expressed in lymphoid tissues.10 The
t(1;19) occurs in 2 forms: 1) a reciprocal translocation
t(1;19)(q23;p13) or, more often, 2) an unbalanced form
characterized by 2 normal chromosomes 1 and 19 and a
rearranged chromosome 19, der(19)t(1,19)(q23;p13). In
some studies, patients with the reciprocal translocation
had a worse outcome.11 Children with t(1;19) who were
treated on conventional antimetabolite-based therapy
2148

protocols had poor outcomes.12 Newer intensified regimens have improved prognosis, but patients with a balanced t(1;19) translocation still have an adverse
prognosis.13 In the current study, we reviewed the outcome of adults with ALL and t(1;19) who received the
hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and dexamethasone alternating with
methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine (hyper-CVAD)
regimen.14

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group and Therapy
Adults with newly diagnosed ALL who were referred to
the Leukemia Department at the University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1983 to 2007 were
reviewed. In total, 411 adults had pre-B-cell ALL and
were categorized into the following chromosome groups:
t(1;19), normal (diploid), lymphoma-like, Ph-positive,
t(4;11), and miscellaneous. The lymphoma-like group
included patients with del(6q), add(14q), t(11;14), and
t(14;18).
The miscellaneous group included patients with
hyperdiploidy and patients with hypodiploidy. The majority of patients (80%) received the hyper-CVAD regimen, which consisted of fractionated cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and dexamethasone alternating with high doses of methotrexate and
cytarabine.14 Adults who were referred before 1992
received the vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone
(VAD) regimen or the cytoxan plus VAD regimen.15

Statistical Analysis
The endpoints that we examined included complete
response (CR), complete response duration (CRD), and
overall survival (OS). A CR response required bone marrow with <5% blasts, a neutrophil count 1000/mL, and
a platelet count 100,000/mL. Survival was estimated by
using the Kaplan-Meier method,16 and differences in survival curves were analyzed by using the log-rank test.17
Differences among variables were compared by using the
chi-square test or Wilcoxon tests.

t(1;19) were compared with patients in all cytogenetic

DISCUSSION
The prognostic impact of t(1;19) in children and adults
with ALL is controversial. Early data suggested that this
translocation conferred a poor prognosis. Crist et al
reported on 285 children with pre-B-cell ALL who were
treated by the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) with
induction therapy that included prednisone, vincristine,
and L-asparaginase from 1986 to 1989. In that study,
children with t(1;19) had significantly worse outcomes.18
In 1994, Pui et al reported the St. Jude data from 1979 to
1994 on 1101 children with newly diagnosed ALL.11
Forty-five children had either a balanced translocation (n
¼ 10) or derivative translocation del (n ¼ 30). The 5-year
event-free survival rate in that study was 65% in children
with del(19)t(1;19) and 41% in children with t(1;19) (P
¼ .15).11 In the Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) studies
from 1988 to 1994, 47 of 1322 children (3.6%) had

t(1;19). The majority of children with t(1;19) were classified as poor-risk patients, whereas <50% of the B-lineage
patients without this translocation were classified as poorrisk patients (P ¼ .008). The 4-year event-free survival
rate was 76% in patients with t(1;19) and 68% in the
other B-lineage patients (P ¼ .37). A significantly better
outcome was noted in patients who had unbalanced translocations compared with balanced translocations (4-year
event-free survival rate, 81% vs 42%; P ¼ .003).13
Kager et al described the incidence and outcome of
Austrian children using polymerase chain reaction analysis to identify the TCF-PBX1 transcript. They detected
the fusion gene in 31 of 859 children with ALL (3.6%).
Ten patients in their study had a balanced translocation,
10 children had an unbalanced translocation, and 5 children had both variants in 2 distinct clones. The 5-year
event-free survival rate was 90%. The authors examined
outcomes according to 4 sequential protocols that were
used between 1986 and 2003 and reported that patients
appeared to do better with higher dose intensity regimens.19 A similarly improved prognosis for patients with
t(1;19) was reported with more intensive therapy by the
POG in 2000.20 Recently, Schultz et al combined data
from the POG and the CCG (now merged as the Children’s Oncology Group), and suggested that t(1;19) should
not be included in the risk stratification algorithm.21

Similar data have been reported in adult ALL. In a
French study from 1987 to 1992 of 443 adults with ALL,
t(1;19) was present in 11 patients (3%), and those patients
tended to be younger (median age, 22 years). All 11
patients in that study achieved a complete remission, but
the median event-free survival was only 6 months, and the
3-year event-free survival rate was 20%.22 In a study by
Secker-Walker et al (Medical Research Council [MRC]
trials, 1985-1992), 10 of 850 adults (3%) had t(1;19),
and 7 had unbalanced translocations. Their median disease-free survival was 36 months.23 More recently, Foa
et al reported the experience of the Italian Study Group
for Adult Hematologic Malignancies in adults with ALL
and the E2A-PBX1 fusion protein. In that study, of
305 patients, 10 (3.3%) had t(1;19), and all had a pre-Bcell phenotype and were relatively young (median age,
22 years). The CR rate was 90%, and 4 patients remained
alive in CR at the time of the report.24 In an MRC/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (MRC-ECOG) trial in
2007,25 t(1;19) was identified in 24 of 1522 patients
(1.5%), and these patients had a 5-year OS rate of 32%.
In other MRC-ECOG trials, there was no significant
association between the translocation and prognosis.26-28
The ECOG trials listed above used an induction regimen
of daunorubicin, vincristine, L-asparaginase, prednisone,
and methotrexate followed by a second induction regimen
of cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 6 mercaptopurine, and
methotrexate. The poorer prognosis reported in adult
patients with t(1;19) in those studies may be attributed in
part to the different induction regimens that were used.

t(1;19) and Hyper-CVAD in ALL/Garg et al

The role of stem cell transplantation (SCT) in adult
patients with ALL and t(1;19) was discussed by Vey et al.
In their study, 24 adult patients with ALL and t(1;19) were
given high-dose induction chemotherapy with prednisone,
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and either daunorubicin or
idarubicin. This was followed by intensive consolidation
with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone. Patients who
achieved a CR were assigned to undergo either allogeneic
SCT if a donor was available or autologous stem cell transplantation. Twenty-one of 24 patients (87%) achieved a
CR after induction chemotherapy: Eight patients underwent allogeneic SCT, and 5 patients underwent autologous
SCT. The overall 5-year disease-free survival rate was 39%.
The patients who underwent allogeneic SCT had a 5-year
disease-free survival rate of 63% compared with 16% in the
autologous SCT arm and 0% in the maintenance chemotherapy arm, a finding that did not reach statistical significance. The 5-year OS rate for all 24 patients with t(1;19)
was 54%. The authors argued that allogeneic SCT should
be offered in first CR to patients with ALL and t(1;19)
given their poor outcome with chemotherapy.29 The OS of
adult patients with ALL and t(1;19) at our center who
received the hyper-CVAD regimen compared favorably
with the outcome of patients who underwent allogeneic
transplantation.
The literature results suggested a better outcome for
patients with t(1;19) who received higher dose intensity
chemotherapy. Analysis of the prognostic significance of
t(1;19) has been limited, because it is present in only 1% to
3% of patients with pre-B-cell ALL. In the pediatric population, it often is associated with other well known highrisk factors. However, there is a clear trend for improved
prognosis of these patients over time with risk-adapted, intensive, multiagent chemotherapy. Hyper-CVAD uses
dose-intensive therapy and originally was derived from
childhood regimens that were designed to treat Burkitt leukemia. This may explain the favorable outcome of patients
with t(1;19) who received hyper-CVAD.
In this study, adult patients with the t(1;19) abnormality had an excellent prognosis when they received the
hyper-CVAD regimen. Comparing patients who carried
t(1;19) and patients without this abnormality, the t(1;19)
group had a significant improvement in CRD and OS.
Given the rarity of patients with this cytogenetic aberration, only a multicenter trial would allow further demonstration of the apparent efficacy of this regimen.
